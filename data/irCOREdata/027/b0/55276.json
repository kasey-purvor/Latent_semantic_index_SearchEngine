Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 2 of 32 \n \n1.0 Introduction \nThe amalgamation of Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia at 1.1-1.0 Ga resulted in the Grenville \nOrogeny and the assembly of Rodinia (Hoffman 1991; Sadowski & Bettencourt 1996; Li et \nal. 2008). The erosion of the Grenville mountain chain during the early Neoproterozoic led to \nthe deposition of thick siliciclastic successions in the present day circum-North Atlantic \nregion (Rainbird et al. 2001; Cawood et al. 2007; Krabbendam et al. 2008; Pettersson et al. \n2009). Many of these successions were subsequently deformed at medium to high-grade \nmetamorphic grades during the Precambrian Knoydartian and Lower Palaeozoic Caledonian \norogenies, as a result of which it is commonly difficult to reconstruct original depositional \nsettings. In this paper we focus on one of those sequences, the Moine Supergroup of northern \nScotland. The tectonic setting of the Moine Supergroup basin(s) depends on the \npalaeocontinental configuration during the early Neoproterozoic. A setting well within \nRodinia was suggested by Dalziel & Soper (2001) on the basis of a reconstruction that placed \nBaltica directly opposite East Greenland (Fig 1a). In contrast, a more recent reconstruction \nplaces northern Scotland much closer to the margin of Rodinia (Fig 1b; Li et al. 2008; \nCawood et al. 2010).  \n[Figure 1] \nThe Moine Supergroup has previously been interpreted as a shallow-marine deposit that \naccumulated in extensional rift basins (Strachan 1986; Glendinning 1988; Soper et al. 1998). \nIt was suggested by Dalziel & Soper (2001) that these were intracratonic \u2018failed rifts\u2019 \ndeveloped in the central part of Rodinia at the same time as the separation of Antarctica from \nwestern North America at c.850-800 Ma. Alternatively, Krabbendam et al. (2008) interpreted \nlower parts of the Moine Supergroup as fluvial, braidplain deposits (see also Bonsor & Prave \n2008) that accumulated in a major foreland basin located along the margin of the developing \nGrenville orogen. These authors also suggested correlation with the sedimentologically \nsimilar Torridon Group that is located on the foreland to the Caledonian orogen in northern \nScotland. The discovery of a thick well-preserved stratigraphic succession of the Morar \nGroup in low strain zones in the Fannich Mountains of northern Scotland (Fig 2) provides an \nopportunity to assess the sedimentology of this hitherto poorly known part of the Moine \nSupergroup, and thence to examine the implications for regional correlations and the tectonic \nsetting of the depositional basin.  \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 3 of 32 \n \n[Figure 2] \n \n2.0 Geological Setting \nThe lowest part of the Moine Supergroup is the Morar Group, mainly comprising thick \nsequences of meta-sandstone (psammite) with subordinate meta-siltstone (semi-pelite) and \nmeta-mudstone (pelite) (Holdsworth et al. 1994).  Outcrop of the Morar Group is limited to \nthe west by the Moine Thrust, forming the margin of the Caledonian orogen in Scotland, and \nto the east by the Sgurr Beag Thrust (Fig. 2). The generally pelitic Glenfinnan Group and \npsammitic Loch Eil Group occur in the hangingwall of this thrust (Fig. 2). Within both the \nMorar and Glenfinnan groups, inliers of Archaean Lewisianoid gneiss are thought to \nrepresent the basement on which the Moine rocks were deposited (e.g. Peach et al. 1907 \nRamsay 1958; Holdsworth 1989; Friend et al. 2008) The Morar Group contains detrital \nzircons that yield U-Pb ages of between 1.7 and 1.0 Ga (Friend et al. 2003; Kirkland et al. \n2008) and these have been interpreted to be derived from Eastern Laurentia (Friend et al. \n2003; Cawood et al. 2007; Kirkland et al. 2008) or, more specifically, the Grenville orogen \n(Krabbendam et al. 2008) . The youngest reliable concordant zircon grains reported from \ndifferent samples are 1032 \u00b124 Ma (Friend et al. 2003); 1022 \u00b124 Ma (Kirkland et al. 2008) \nand 980 \u00b1 2 Ma (D. Peters, pers. comm. in Cawood et al. 2007). The structural and \nmetamorphic complexity of the Moine rocks results from their involvement in Knoydartian \n(c.820-725 Ma), Grampian (470-460 Ma) and Scandian (435-425 Ma) orogenic events, the \nlatter two of which are part of the Caledonian orogenic cycle (Strachan et al. 2002, 2010; \nCutts et al. 2010).  \n \nDespite the deformational overprinting, it has proved possible to achieve reasonably detailed \nsedimentological analysis in areas of low tectonic strain (Glendinning 1988; Bonsor and \nPrave 2008; Krabbendam et al. 2008). Krabbendam et al. (2008) interpreted the lowermost \npart of the Morar Group (the Altnaharra Formation) in Sutherland, northern Scotland (Fig. 2) \nas a fluvial braidplain deposit. Stratigraphically and structurally higher levels of the Morar \nGroup are exposed further south in the Fannich Mountains (Fig. 2). Here, the Altnaharra \nFormation passes up into, in order, the Glascarnoch, Vaich Pelite, Crom Psammite and \nDiebidale Pelite formations (Fig. 3; Krabbendam et al. in press). The total thickness of the \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 4 of 32 \n \nMorar Group is estimated to be c.6.0-9.0 km. In this paper we focus on the sedimentology of \nthe upper Altnaharra and Glascarnoch formations.  The succession is deformed on a large \nscale into major folds, but is internally intact and strain is overall not high, and thus it has \nproved possible to reconstruct the original pre-deformational stratigraphy (Fig. 4; \nKrabbendam et al. in press). The stratigraphic succession is characterised by some significant \nlateral variations: the Altnaharra Formation thins towards the east, whilst the Glascarnoch \nFormation thickens to the east and forms, in part, its lateral equivalent.   \n \n[Figures 3 and 4] \n3.0 Sedimentology of the middle Morar Group: Altnaharra and Glascarnoch \nformations \n3.1 Facies types and architecture \nThe Altnaharra and Glascarnoch formations comprise psammites interbedded with varying \namounts of pelite. Tectonic deformation was associated with amphibolite-facies \nmetamorphism and recrystallisation which obliterated most of the original grain textures, \nsuch as grain shape and sorting, although locally detrital feldspar grains can be recognised.   \nHowever, larger-scale original sedimentary features of the rocks are well preserved in km-\nscale low strain zones within the hinge zones of the regional folds (Krabbendam et al. in \npress).  Three main lithofacies are identified: LF1, LF2 and LF3 (Fig. 5).  Transitions \nbetween these lithofacies are gradual and consistently define a fining-upward succession \nrecognised by an increase in proportion of finer-grained psammites and pelitic lithologies in \nthe younger parts of the succession.  \n[Figure 5] \n  \n3.1.1 Lithofacies 1 (LF1): trough cross-bedded psammite. \nLF1 is observed throughout the Glen Achall Member, the uppermost unit of the Altnaharra \nFormation. Its stratigraphic thickness is approximately 1.5-2 km and is composed mainly of \nfeldspathic to quartzose psammite, containing c. 65% quartz, c. 25% feldspar and c. 10% \nmica. The feldspathic composition gives a variable pink hue to the rocks.  The micas are \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 5 of 32 \n \nderived from the metamorphism of clay minerals, however, the quartz-feldspar ratio is \nunlikely to have been significantly changed by metamorphism.   \n \nPsammite constitutes more than 95% of LF1, with the remainder being pelite.   The \nlithofacies is typified by amalgamated and stacked sets and co-sets of trough cross-beds, 0.05 \nto 0.6 m thick.  These define wide lens-shaped channel forms, with large width-to-depth \nratios (commonly >15 m wide and < 0.5 m thick), and erosive, scalloped bed bases.  Tabular \ncross-beds are less frequent but are of a similar thickness to the trough-cross beds.  Planar \ncross-stratified lenticular and wedge-shaped beds are uncommon, but where observed range \nfrom c. 3 to 5 m in length and 0.2 to 0.5 m thick.  These preserved bed dimensions are, \nhowever, regarded as minimal values due to erosional truncation by overlying beds.  No \nmud-drapes, gravel clasts, or gravel lags have been observed.  Soft-sediment deformation is \nrare, but where observed generally shows pinched cuspate geometry, with greatest \ndeformation towards the bed base.  Almost all observed soft-sediment deformation features \nare truncated by overlying beds. LF1 occurs in 10-20 m thick, fining-upward packages (Fig. \n6), each characterised by ripple cross-laminated psammite and minor pelitic beds 1 to 2 cm \nthick at the base, and multi-storey trough and tabular cross-beds at the top.  Some coarsening-\nupwards facies sequences, of a similar thickness, are also observed.  \n[Figure 6] \n3.1.2 Lithofacies 2 (LF2): interbedded cross-bedded psammite and pelite. \nLF2 units develop upwards from LF1 and are observed over a stratigraphic thickness of c. 2 \nkm, within the lower to middle Glascarnoch Formation.  LF2 is composed of well developed \ndecametre-scale, fining-and coarsening-upward units, marked by both trough- and planar-\ncross bed sets and lenticular bed geometries (Fig. 7a).  In comparison to LF1, beds are thinner \n(typically 0.02 to 0.3 m thick), bed bases less scalloped, planar cross-stratified beds are more \ncommon, and channel width-to-depth ratios larger (>20 m wide; <0.5m thick) (Fig. 7b).  \nPelitic beds are more common and are thicker (commonly 1 to 4 cm thick) than in LF1, so \nthat pelitic lithofacies comprise up to c. 30% of each coarsening-upward unit.   There is a \ngreater preservation of fines as mud drapes along the foresets of the bedforms throughout the \nLF2 units than in LF1.  Ripple cross-lamination is also more prevalent within the LF2 facies.  \nThe psammitic rocks are generally more mature than in LF1, and typically composed of c. \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 6 of 32 \n \n65% quartz, c. 20% feldspar and c. 15% mica; the higher mica content resulting in a greyer \nhue.  Convoluted, pinched, cuspate soft-sediment deformation features and slump folds are \nmore common within LF2 than in LF1 and are broadly orientated in the dominant palaeoflow \ndirection.  Almost all soft-sediment deformation features are truncated by the overlying beds. \n[Figure 7] \n \n3.1.3 Lithofacies 3 (LF3): interbedded, ripple-laminated psammite and pelite. \nLF3 units develop upwards from LF2, and are observed within the upper Glascarnoch \nFormation over a stratigraphic thickness of 1.5 to 2 km.   The LF3 units are composed of \ndecametre-scale coarsening upwards units, c. 3-16 m thick, containing broadly equal \nproportions of micaceous psammite and pelite beds.   Characteristically, LF3 units contain a \nwide range of ripple-scale bedforms.  Each unit has a pelitic base, a gradual upward increase \nof psammite beds and a predominantly psammititc top (Fig. 8).  Concomitant with this \nupward lithological change is a progressive change of bedform structures.  The basal pelitic \nparts show rhythmic bundles of semi-pelitic and psammitic flaser, wavy, lenticular and \npinstripe bedforms (Fig. 9a).  The central parts of the units show very thin trough cross-\nbedding and tabular psammitic channel facies with abundant ripple-lamination and mud-\ndrapes (Fig. 9b).   \n[Figures 8 and 9] \n \nThe uppermost parts of the LF3 units are predominantly composed of stacked and nested \ntrough, and tabular cross-bed co-sets of micaceous psammite (Fig. 9c).  Locally mature \nquartzite layers (c. >80% quartz) occur in these positions.  Mud-drapes remain well \ndeveloped within all bed forms (Fig. 9d), but pelitic beds between individual cross-beds \nbecome thinner upwards within each unit.  Bed thicknesses increase from <0.02 m at the base \nof the LF3 units, to c. 0.4 m at the top.  All bed geometries define very wide, shallow, planar-\nbased channels, typically >50 m wide but only c. 0.2 m deep.  Sharp, planar bed-base \ngeometries are typical; only the uppermost cross-beds of LF3 units display shallow, \nscalloped-bed base geometries and lenticular channel forms.   \n \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 7 of 32 \n \nFlow-reversal ripple forms indicate deposition influenced by bi-directional palaeoflow, in \nwhich there was a dominant NW and sub-dominant SE current direction (Fig. 9e).   The flow \nreversal ripple forms appear as lozenge-shaped forms, which are truncated by larger, \noverlying, ripples.  The internal cross laminae of the truncated ripples dip in the opposite \ndirection to the cross laminae of larger overlying ripple forms.  The larger ripples reflect the \ndominant flow direction, whereas a weaker current operating in the opposite direction formed \nthe smaller lozenge-shaped ripples.   \n \nSoft-sediment deformation is very common within LF3, particularly within the thick cross-\nbeds in the upper sections of the LF3 units.  Convoluted, pinched deformation features, slump \nfolding, and wisp-like flame structures are all observed.  As in LF2, the direction of \noverturning of slump folds is broadly parallel to local palaeoflow directions. \n \n \n3.2 Palaeocurrent data  \n \nPalaeoflow measurements were taken from axes of trough cross bedding where they were \nconstrained in three dimensions, as these were the most reliable indicators exposed. Data \nfrom planar cross-stratified beds were not used because of the potential for such features to \nexhibit migration other than in down-flow direction.  Similarly, measurements were not used \nfrom ripple cross-laminations, as these small bedforms can often reflect the directions of \nminor flows, unrepresentative of the main sediment transport direction.   \n \nThe field measurements used were corrected for tectonic tilt along horizontal axes, as the \nlarge-scale folds in the vicinity of the analysed sections are broadly cylindrical, with little or \nno evidence of rotation along vertical axes (Krabbendam et al. in press).   The resulting data \nshow that palaeocurrents in LF1 and LF2 (upper Altnaharra to lower Glascarnoch Formation) \nwere directed NW-NE, whilst in LF3 (upper Glascarnoch Formation) palaeocurrents were \nbimodal, with a dominant NW-NNE current direction, and a weaker SE flow (Fig. 10).  This \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 8 of 32 \n \ntransition from a broadly unimodal palaeocurrent direction at the base of the stratigraphy to a \nbimodal palaeocurrent at the top, is gradual, with no abrupt changes observed.  \n[Figure 10] \n \n \n4.0 Palaeoenvironmental Interpretation \n \nThe lithofacies define a fining-upward facies succession, from stacked and amalgamated \ntrough-cross bed sets at the base, to much more variable coarsening-upward packages of \nrhythmically interbedded pelitic and psammitic lithologies at the top (Table 1).   Over the \nsame stratigraphic interval, palaeoflow develops upwards from broadly unimodal NW-NE \nflow, to weakly bimodal NW-SE flow.   \n[Table 1] \n \n4.1 LF1 \nThe stacked, amalgamated trough-cross beds of LF1 in the upper Altnaharra Formation are \ninterpreted as individual channel forms, and the upward fining and thinning of the stacked \ntrough cross-beds on a metre-scale is inferred to reflect waning flows (Leeder 1999; Allen \n1985).  The dominance of trough cross-bedding relative to planar cross-stratified beds \nindicates that the depositing flows were sufficiently strong to support a traction load.  \nHowever, the absence of gravels, or gravel lags within the channels, and low angle of the \nforesets within the cross beds suggest that flow was only of moderate energy (Kleinhaus \n2001; Leeder 1999; Bridge 1993, 2003).   \n \nThe lack of obvious abrupt changes in maturity of the psammite, or size of the bedforms \nsuggests that the multi-storey, nested geometry of the trough-cross bed units was formed by \nchannels of relatively constant discharge, rather than channels of flashy and highly variable \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 9 of 32 \n \ndischarge (Skelly et al. 2003; Bridge 1993; Bluck 1976).  Planar cross-bedded units \norientated at high angles to the channel margins are interpreted as laterally accreting channel \nbars, but the rare preservation of such features supports the inference that the depositional \nsetting was characterised by laterally shifting channels (Miall 1992; Bridge 2003).  These \nchannel facies, together with the broadly unimodal NW-NE palaeoflow are typical of \ndeposition within a relatively distal, medium-to-low energy fluvial braidplain environment.   \nSimilar facies are widely published from both ancient (i.e. pre-Devonian land plant fluvial \nsystems; e.g. Fedo and Cooper 1990) and modern distal braidplain deposits (e.g. the modern \ndistal Himalayan-Siwalik system) (Fisher et al. 2007; Nichols and Fisher 2007; Kumar et al. \n2007; Nakayama and Ulak 1999).  Compared to LF1, proximal or medial braidplain settings \nwould be expected to contain less mature sediment, larger cross-beds and coarser flow \ndeposits (Plink-Bjorklund et al. 2005; Newell et al. 1999; Leeder 1999; Frostick and Steel \n1993).  \n \n4.2 LF2 \n \nThe development of more coarsening-upward packages within LF2 compared to LF1 \nindicates a distinct change to the depositional environment (Miall 1990; Plint and Walker \n1992).  Most likely, deposition began to take place in a lower-energy shallow marine, rather \nthan non-marine environment.  The coarsening-upward LF2 units could result from a wide \nvariety of depositional environments, however, the prevalence of ripple structures in pelite-\nrich lithologies at the base of the LF2 units, and the presence of mud drapes within the upper \ntrough cross-bed psammitic facies, suggest that the LF2 facies resulted from tidally \ninfluenced fluvial deposition within a very distal fluvial braidplain, or shoreline, setting \n(Yang et al. 2008; Allen and Fielding 2007; Fisher et al. 2007; Plint and Walker 1992; \nRoberts 2007; Schumm 1993).  The psammitic channel facies within the fining-upward facies \nsequences, and at the top of the coarsening-upward units, is likely to represent fluvially \ninfluenced sediment input to the inferred shallow marine depositional setting along a braid-\ndelta, where fluvial channels prograded out from a palaeo-shoreline (McPherson et al. 1987; \nMiall 1990; Plint and Walker 1992).   The lack of terrestrial vegetation in the Neoproterozoic \nmeans that fluvial channels were not confined by vegetation as is the case in modern \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 10 of 32 \n \nmeandering river systems (Long 2006).  As a result, Neoproterozoic shorelines would \nprobably have been characterised by a distributary network of numerous laterally aggrading, \nlow energy, shallow fluvial channels, many of which would have been active within a braid-\ndelta at any one time (McPherson et al. 1987).  This is reflected by the persistent repetition, \nlaterally and vertically, of similar fining- and coarsening-upward units within the lower \nGlascarnoch Formation.    \n \n4.3 LF3 \n \nOn a kilometre-scale, the repetitive, fining-upward and coarsening-upward packages of LF2 \ndevelop upward into the rhythmically interbedded pelitic and psammitic coarsening-up \npackages of LF3.  The repetitive (centimetre-scale) alternation of pinstripe and flaser bedding \nin the basal parts of these LF3 packages is very characteristic of oscillatory current energy.  \nOn a larger-scale (metre-scale), the alternation of the pinstripe and flaser bed units, with \nthicker micaceous-psammitic beds, indicates oscillatory flow energy of a longer time period.  \nThis dual-scale of rhythmic bed bundling which typifies the c. 2.0 km thickness of LF3, is \ncharacteristic of tidally influenced, shallow-marine deposition where spring-neap tidal cycles \nare superimposed onto diurnal tides (Chakraborty and Sensarma 2008; Yang et al. 2008; \nAspler et al. 1994; Plint and Walker 1992).   \n \nFlow reversal ripple forms and reactivation surfaces, together with the bimodal palaeoflow \ndata are further evidence for reversals in flow current direction on a cm-scale throughout LF3 \n(Allen and Fielding 2007; Plint and Walker 1992).   Lacustrine facies might display a \nbimodal palaeoflow, if, for example, there is wind-induced wave motion acting in opposition \nto other currents, but this would not produce the consistent, rhythmic bundling of lithologies \nand bedforms as observed in LF3 (Kempf et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2008; Martel and Gibling \n1991; Rogers and Astin 1991).   \n \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 11 of 32 \n \nThe wide, shallow, sharp-based tabular-cross beds in LF3, which locally occur with the flaser \nand pinstripe bedding at the base of the LF3 units, are very similar to overbank, sheet flow \ndeposits within distal fluvial settings (Long 2006; Erikkson et al. 1998).  However, the \njuxtaposition of these sharp-based tabular cross-beds with bundles of flaser and pinstripe \nbedding means they are more likely to represent storm-surge generated deposits (Plint and \nWalker 1992; Fisher et al. 2007), which is supported by the rare presence of hummocky \nstratified beds. The upward development of stacked multi-storey trough-cross beds towards \nthe top of the coarsening-upward units suggests repeated returns to fluvially influenced \ndeposition (Ghinassi et al. 2009; Plint and Walker 1992).   Taken together, the LF3 facies are \nindicative of tidally-influenced shallow-marine deposition, above fair-weather base and close \nto a shoreline, with intermittent tidally influenced fluvial deposition.   \n \n5. Soft-sediment deformation features \nSoft-sediment deformation features occur most commonly within the upper, finer lithofacies \n(LF2 and LF3), and very few are observed within the coarser, lower lithofacies (LF1).  These \nfeatures are invariably confined to individual beds and the tops of the deformation features \nare typically truncated by overlying beds.  Seismic triggering of the deformation therefore \nseems unlikely, as a more random distribution of the features would be expected, as well as \ndeformation of multiple beds.  It is more likely that the soft-sediment deformation results \nfrom local depositional conditions, independent of seismic activity.  The systematic decrease \nin amplitude and scale of deformation upward from bed base to bed top in many of the \nconvoluted beds, indicates generation by fluid-escape following rapid sediment deposition in \nwaterlogged sediment (see Maltman 1994; Nicholson 1993).  Fluid escape can happen at any \ntime in the unstable, and over-pressurised water-laden sediment \u2013 e.g. during a flood event. \nSlump folds, the other main type of soft-sediment deformation feature, are also largely \ncontained to individual beds.  Flows of unconsolidated, water-laden sediment can occur on \nany slope in a variety of settings.  However, the apparent preferred orientation to the slump \nfolds, so that the fold hinges are normal to the dominant NW-NNE palaeoflow direction, does \nsuggest that the flows reflect movement of the sediment down the depositional slope within \nthe basin in the direction of the dominant palaeoflow.  The upward increase in abundance of \nsoft-sediment features therefore suggests an increase in palaeoslope in the direction of \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 12 of 32 \n \npalaeoflow within the shallow-marine depositional environment, compared to the distal \nbraidplain environment.   \n \n6. Sedimentological trends \nTaking into account the analysis of the lower Altnaharra Formation by Krabbendam et al. \n(2008), the complete vertical facies transition within the lower and middle Morar Groups is \nfrom: medium-energy fluvial braidplain deposition, characterised by large (metre-scale) \ntrough-cross bedded psammite; to distal braidplain deposition, characterised by greater \npreservation of fines, smaller trough-cross beds and a greater preservation of lateral accretion \nfeatures; to, finally, tide-dominated shallow-marine deposition, reflected by rhythmic bundles \nof interbedded pelitic and psammitic lithologies in the upper Glascarnoch Formation.     \n \nCollectively, the facies are evidence for a transition from a fluvial braidplain to tidally \ninfluenced shallow-marine depositional setting within the middle part of the Morar Group.  \nThis transition occurs gradually over a c. 4-6 km thickness (although tectonic strain means \nthis is a maximum thickness).   Within the same stratigraphic interval, palaeocurrent data \nindicate current patterns developed gradually from broadly unimodal NW-NNE directed flow \nat the base of the succession, to bimodal NW-SE flow at the top.   \n \nThere are significant lateral lithofacies variations.  Within the upper Altnaharra Formation, \nLF1 passes laterally eastward in to LF3, and similarly within the Glascarnoch Formation LF2 \npasses laterally eastward in to LF3 (Fig. 11).  There is, therefore, an upward and eastward \npredominance of the finer and more complex shallow-marine lithofacies.   These variations \ncorrespond to an apparent eastward thinning of the Altnaharra Formation (LF1), whilst the \nGlascarnoch Formation (LF2 and LF3) thickens eastward by c. 2 to 3 km, over a distance of \nc. 20 km (Fig. 11).    \n[Figure 11] \n \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 13 of 32 \n \n7.0 Discussion \n7.1 Basin models for the Moine Supergroup \nThe thick and laterally extensive siliciclastic units of the Altnaharra and Glascarnoch \nformations are characterised by sedimentary facies that are diagnostic of a large scale fluvio-\nmarine basin. The upward stratigraphic transition in depositional setting from medial \nbraidplain to shallow-marine most likely reflects a gradual increase in the rate of generation \nof accommodation space as a result of tectonic subsidence, as well as the vertical \nsuperposition of increasingly distal facies. The general uniformity of sediment composition \nindicates that the rate of change of sediment flux in the basin was slight. This contrasts with \nthe findings of Glendinning (1988) who interpreted the Upper Morar Psammite in \nArdnamurchan and Morar (c.120 km south of the present study area, Figure 2) as a shallow \nmarine deposit that accumulated in an active half-graben.  However, the Altnaharra and \nGlascarnoch Formations lack the hallmark features of rift-basin successions: there is no \nevidence for the episodic emplacement of fault-generated detritus (all facies and lithogical \ntransitions are very gradual); there is no evidence for abrupt, periodic (i.e. repetitive) \ngeneration of accommodation space that would be expected along basin-bounding faults; nor \nare there any abrupt vertical or lateral facies transitions which are characteristic of rift-basin \nsettings (e.g. Arche and Lopez-Gomez 2005).  Over c. 4-6 km of stratigraphy there is no \nindication of volcanic input, no coarse-grained deposits or rapid changes to the dominant \npalaeoflow direction, which is atypical of rift basin settings (e.g. Allen and Allen 2005). \nEssentially the same conclusions were reached by Bonsor & Prave (2008) in their re-\nappraisal of the Upper Morar Psammite in Ardnamurchan as a medium-energy fluvial \nbraidplain deposit that accumulated in a large-scale basin.  \n \n7.2. Regional correlations \nThe early Neoproterozoic Torridon Group outcrops extensively on the Caledonian foreland in \nnorthern Scotland, west of the Moine Thrust Zone (Stewart 2002 and references therein). The \npossibility of correlation of the Torridon Group and the Moine Supergroup has been \ndiscussed frequently (e.g. Peach et al. 1907; Kennedy 1951; Sutton & Watson 1964; Stewart \n2002; Friend et al. 2003), although has often been discounted because of the potentially large \ndisplacements that may have occurred along the intervening Moine Thrust. The most recent \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 14 of 32 \n \ncomparison of stratigraphy, sedimentology, geochemistry and detrital zircon data, however, \nfavours correlation of the lower Altnaharra Formation (lowermost Morar group) and the \nApplecross Formation of the Torridon Group in Sutherland (Krabbendam et al. 2008). Both \nare interpreted as fluvial braidplain deposits that accumulated in the foreland basin to the \ndeveloping Grenville Orogen. The findings of the present study are consistent with this \nmodel. Interestingly, it is now apparent that both the Morar and Torridon groups are \ncharacterised by major fining-upwards trends. In the Morar Group, the present study \ndemonstrates a fluvial to marine transition, whereas in the Torridon Group the facies change \nis from fluvial to lacustrine (Stewart 2002).    \n  \n7.3 Tectonic setting \nThe Torridon and Morar basin is envisaged by Rainbird et al. (2001), Kinnaird et al. (2007) \nand Krabbendam et al. (2008) as an elongate, orogen-parallel foreland basin in front of the \nGrenville orogen.  In a recent tectonic reconstruction, Cawood et al. (2010) suggested a \nclockwise rotation of Baltica away from Laurentia after 1250 Ma, creating a large triangular \nbasin, the Asgard Sea, coeval with Grenville orogenesis farther south (present-day \ncoordinates) (Fig 1b).  The apex of the Asgard Sea would have been positioned close to \nScotland, whilst farther north, facing northern Greenland and Scandinavia, the Asgard Sea \nwas probably floored by oceanic crust.  This reconstruction would imply that north of \nScotland there was a large basin into which sediment, derived from the Grenville orogen, was \nrouted. Thus there must have been a transition from a continental foreland basin to a marine \nbasin; a transition that could have changed location with time, as both the Grenville orogen \nand the Asgard Sea developed.  In the context of the present paper, this is attractive, in that \nthe Torridon and lowermost Morar groups could represent the (orogen-parallel) foreland part, \nwhilst the middle Morar group as reported here could represent the transition into the marine \nbasin.  This is consistent with the predominantly eastward palaeocurrents reported from the \nTorridon Group and lowermost Morar Group (Nicholson 1993; Stewart 2002; Krabbendam et \nal. 2008) and the northerly palaeocurrents reported higher up in the sequence in this study \nand in Bonsor & Prave (2008).  Furthermore, it provides a good explanation for sediment flux \nto the Krummedal sequence in NE Greenland and other early Neoproterozoic sequences in \nSvalbard and Caledonide allcohthons in northern Norway.  These siliciclastic (now \nmetamorphosed) sequences were deposited at c. 1000 and contain detrital zircon distributions \nBonsor et al. Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 15 of 32 \n \nsimilar to the Morar Group, and ultimately mainly derived from the Grenville orogen \n(Strachan et al. 1995; Watt et al. 2001; Cawood et al. 2007, 2010; Kirkland et al. 2008; \nPettersson et al. 2009).  \n \n8.0 Conclusions \nNew sedimentological data from the Altnaharra and Glascarnoch Formations provides \nevidence for a large-scale transition from distal fluvial braidplain to shallow-marine, tidally \ninfluenced, deposition over a c. 6 km stratigraphic thickness in the middle Morar Group \n(lower Moine Supergroup) in northern Scotland.  Amalgamated and multi-storey sets of \ntrough and tabular cross-bedding, with associated planar cross-bedding, define channel forms \nthat characterise the lowest parts of the stratigraphy, whilst finer and more complex \ncoarsening-upward packages of rhythmically interbedded pelitic and psammitic lithologies \ntypify the uppermost stratigraphic sections.  Lateral and vertical changes between the \nlithofacies are gradual and accompanied by a concomitant upward transition in palaeoflow \ndirection from broadly unimodel NW-NNE flow, to weakly bimodal NW-SE flow.   The \nfacies succession is inferred to be the result of vertical superposition of increasingly distal \nshallow-marine, tidally influenced facies, over medial to distal braidplain facies.  Such a \ngradual large-scale transition in depositional environment, suggests a large basinal setting, \ninconsistent with an episodic extensional rift-basin interpretation.  Instead, we suggest that, \ndeposition occurred in a transition between a foreland basin to the Grenville orogen and a \nmarine basin associated with the Asgard Sea between Baltica and Laurentia.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Director of the British Geological Survey \n(Natural Environment Research Council).

Morar Group deposition \n \nPage 21 of 32 \n \nTables \nLithofacies Main sedimentological features Interpretation Evidence \nLF1 Stacked, amalgamated trough-cross bed \nsets, within fining-upwards sequences. \nPlanar cross-stratification bedforms rare; \nno gravels. \nLow-energy distal fluvial \nbraidplain. \nThe channel facies indicate lower energy, \nlaterally aggrading braided channels \u2013 \ntypical of distal braidplain environments. \nSimilar facies are observed in both ancient \n(Fedo and Cooper 1990) and modern \ndistal braidplain deposits (Fisher et al. \n2007). \nLF2 Predominately planar cross-bedding \nwithin fining and coarsening-upwards \nsequences.  Pelitic beds, mud drapes and \nripple-cross lamination increasingly \ncommon stratigraphically upward.  \nDistal braidplain-shoreline \nsetting; braid-delta.   \nThe tabular, planar bed geometry indicates \nwide unconfined channels. The prevalence \nof ripple structures and increased \npreservation of mud drapes and pelite \nsuggests deposition occurred in a lower \nenergy environment.  The mixture of \nfining- and coarsening-upward trends, \nconcomitant with the increase in fines and \nripple structures, is characteristic of braid-\ndelta settings (McPherson et al. 1987).     \nLF3 Decametre-scale coarsening-upward \nsequences of rhythmically interbedded \npelitic and psammitic lithologies.  Wide \nrange of ripple bedforms throughout. \nStacked and nested trough and tabular \ncross-beds are common in sequence \ntops. Flow reversal ripple forms, \nindicate bidirectional currents. \nShallow marine shoreline \nenvironment \nThe rhythmic interbedding of pinstripe \nand flaser bedding and thicker planar \ncross-beds is indicative of oscillatory \ncurrents over varying time-scales. Such \nflow conditions would not be expected \nwithin a lacustrine environment (Roger \nand Astin 1991; Yang et al. 2008; \nMertins-Neto 2000; Melchor 2007).  Flow \nreversal ripples, rare storm beds and \npredominance of ripple bedforms support \na shallow-marine interpretation.  \nBonsor et al.
