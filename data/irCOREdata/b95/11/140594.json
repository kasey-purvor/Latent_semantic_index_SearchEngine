From 1960 to 1985,\nfarmers successfully used technology to increase the output of crop and animal\nproducts per unit of land and particularly of labour. This reduced the number of\npeople employed in agriculture, and promoted larger and more specialised farm\nenterprises. Between 1985 and 2006, food prices were relatively low, and\nalthough labour productivity continued to increase, land productivity remained\nrelatively static. However during this period, farmers started to address the\neffects of agriculture on reduced water quality and habitat loss. For\nestablished agricultural products, technological innovation tends to have an\nincremental effect, working through genetic improvement, the removal of abiotic\nand biotic stress (e.g. crop nutrition and protection, irrigation and drainage,\nand animal nutrition, health and housing) and the substitution of labour.\nWhereas the \ufb01rst two processes tend to be scale-neutral, the substitution of\nlabour is usually easiest to achieve on larger farms. Other key areas for\ntechnological innovation include addressing air, soil and water quality,\nbiodiversity, waste reduction, and information management. Over the next 50\nyears, large step-changes in land use arising from agricultural technology are\npredicted to arise from the development of new markets for agricultural\nproducts. A strong bioenergy sector will strengthen the links between crop\ncommodity and energy prices and will have a major effect on future land use.\nClimate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will alter the\nrelative pro\ufb01tability of crop and animal production systems. Lastly, increased\npublic awareness of the links between food, health and the environment could\nsubstantially shift the demand for speci\ufb01c agricultural products. Continual\nimprovements in agricultural technology are pivotal to providing society with\nthe \ufb02exibility to balance the challenges of improving human well-being with the\nmanagement of the planet\u2019s ecosystem. Increased technological innovation\nincreases the probability that agricultural land can be used for other purposes,\nbut the exact relationship is dependent on trade and environmental policies.

The rate and direction of technology change (together with changes in \npopulation, economic growth, governance, and social values) are key drivers \ndetermining future land use (Berhout et al., 1998).  Within this paper, agricultural \ntechnology is defined as the application of knowledge, science, engineering and \nmanagement in crop and animal production systems.  Any agricultural system can be \nconsidered as a group of interacting components that has a boundary within which \ninputs are managed to produce outputs (Figure 1).   \n \n \n \n \nFig 1. Schematic diagram showing how a farmer uses land, labour, finance, genetic \nimprovement and husbandry methods as key inputs to a farm production system, which \nresults in output such as products, waste, environmental services, and information.  There are \nseven key areas (indicated by the vertical dotted lines) where technology can affect \nagricultural systems and thereby land use. \n \n \nDuring much of the 20\nth\n century, a typical aim of a farm enterprise was to maximise \nthe production of crop and animal products in terms of the three key inputs (land, \nlabour, and finance) (Figure 1).  For a given system, this could be done by breeding \nbetter crops or animals, reducing abiotic and biotic stresses on those crops and \nanimals, and substituting labour (Figure 1).  Whilst the production of crop and animal \nproducts provides the financial framework for most farm enterprises, most farmers \nhave a cultural interest in maintaining the quality of air, water and soil resources and \nthe biodiversity on their farm (Stoate et al., 2001).  Since the mid-1980s, greater \npublic awareness of some of the negative effects of agricultural systems on air, water \nand soil quality (Stoate et al., 2001) and biodiversity (Robinson and Sutherland, \n2002), have led to the creation of regulations, financial instruments, and technologies \nto address these issues.  \n \nCase studies \nUsing wheat and milk as case studies, the paper firstly reviews the historic role of \nbreeding and \u201cstress reduction\u201d on increasing production per unit land or per cow.  \nThis is followed by a consideration of labour productivity and total factor \nproductivity.  The second half of the paper examines how technological developments \nin the seven areas identified in Figure 1 may affect agricultural production over the \nWaste \nProduct \n \n \nFarm \nproduction \nsystem \n \n \n \n \nReduce stress \nAir, water and soil \nquality; biodiversity \nAgricultural technology \n \nOutput \nof goods \nand \nservices \nincluding \npositive \nand \nnegative \nenviron-\nmental \nimpacts \n \n \n \nFinance \nLand \nLabour \nGenetic \nimprovement \nInformation \n 3 \nnext 50 years.  Many of the areas are linked, but their combined effect will determine, \nin part, the capacity of the UK to release land from agricultural production.  The main \nconclusions are outlined in the final section.  \n \nWheat production \nSince the 1990s, wheat has been the dominant arable crop in UK and is currently \ngrown on about 40 per cent of the arable area of England.  This dominance followed \nthe development of the Chorleywood bread process in the early 1960s which allowed \nbakers to increase the proportion of British wheat within their flour blends (Russell-\nEggitt, 1977).  Through a range of technologies, the mean yield of wheat in the UK \nhas increased from about 4 tonnes per hectare in the 1960s to about 8 tonnes per \nhectare in 2005 (Figure 2), similar to the increases observed in neighbouring countries \nsuch as Germany.  The importance of weather on yield is apparent from the low yields \ndue to drought in 1976, and high yields in 1984 when a cool wet spring and early \nsummer was followed by dry harvesting conditions (Figure 2).   \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\nYear\nW\nh\ne\na\nt \ny\nie\nld\n (\nt \nh\na\n-1\n)\nUK\nGermany\n \nFigure 2. Annual wheat yields in the UK and Germany from 1962 to 2007 (FAO, 2009). \n \nAustin et al. (1980) estimated that plant breeding contributed about 40 per cent of the \ncereal yield increase observed between 1947 and 1977.  Breeders focussed on \ndeveloping short-strawed varieties that allocated a higher proportion of biomass to \ngrain and were more resistant to lodging, i.e. the collapse of straw.  New varieties also \ntended to flower earlier and thereby had a longer period of grain-filling (Austin, \n1999).  Although increasing carbon dioxide concentrations have been beneficial, \nAustin (1999) attributes less than 5 per cent of the yield increase to this factor. \n \nThe majority of the remaining yield increase has resulted from farmers reducing the \nexposure of the crop to nutrient stress, weeds, pests and diseases.  Applications of \nnitrogen to the UK wheat crop increased from about 28 kg ha\n-1\n in 1951, to 73 kg ha\n-1\n \nby 1962 (Austin, 1999) and to about 185 kg ha\n-1\n since 1985.  Following the \nintroduction of the first selective herbicides in the 1940s, an increased frequency of \nthe application of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides minimised weed competition \nand disease and pest damage. The use of growth regulators since the late 1960s has \n 4 \nalso allowed farmers to minimise yield losses due to stem breakage (e.g. lodging).  \nImproved weed and pest management also enabled farmers to change from spring-\nplanted to autumn-planted varieties, and the simplification of crop rotations.  Because \nautumn-planted varieties spend more time in the ground, they can intercept more solar \nradiation, produce more biomass and thereby provide higher yields.  Although mean \nwheat yields stayed relatively constant between 1996 and 2007 (Figure 2), higher \ncrops yields were still associated with greater profitability (Table 1).   \n \nTable 1. Comparison of yields (t ha\n-1\n) of winter wheat, winter barley, and oilseed rape on the \n25 per cent of most profitable farms in the Eastern Counties of England compared with the \nmean farm (Lang, 2004). \n \nCrop Wheat  Barley  Oilseed rape \nYear 1989 \n-1995 \n1996 \n-2004 \n 1989 \n-1995 \n1996 \n-2004 \n 1989 \n-1995 \n1996 \n-2004 \nTop 25 % 8.8 9.2  7.0 7.0  3.6 4.1 \nMean 7.8 8.3  6.2 6.3  3.0 3.4 \n \n \nMilk production \nThe dairy industry is currently the most important part of the UK livestock sector, as \nmilk represents about one-third of livestock output and the sector provides about half \nthe animals used in beef production.  Technological innovation has allowed the mean \nannual milk yield per dairy cow to increase from about 3600 litres in the 1960s to \nover 7000 litres in 2005 (Figure 3).  Similar increases have been observed in the \nNetherlands, Germany and France.  Although there was a reduction following the \nimposition of quotas in 1984, the annual increase in productivity has been relatively \nconsistent. \n \n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\nYear\nA\nn\nn\nu\na\nl \nm\nil\nk\n y\nie\nld\n p\ne\nr \nc\no\nw\n (\nli\ntr\ne\ns\n)\nNetherlands\nUK\nGermany\nFrance\n \nFigure 3. Observed milk yield per cow (FAO, 2009) in the Netherlands, UK, Germany and \nFrance from 1962 to 2007. \n \nPryce et al. (2004) has estimated that animal breeding and selection has contributed to \nup to 50 per cent of the improvement in milk yield over the past 25 years.  This has \nprimarily been related to the Friesian cattle being replaced by Holstein cattle, which \n 5 \ntend to be larger and therefore can produce higher yields.  The remaining proportion \nof the increase in productivity per cow has primarily been achieved by minimising \nany level of nutritional stress, and increasing the dry matter intake of feed with a \nhigher nutrient density (Eastridge, 2006).  There has been a move from the use of hay \nto grass-silage, and more recently maize-silage, systems.  Detailed nutritional studies \nhave been used to determine how \u201cwaste\u201d products such as molasses, oilseed cake and \nbrewers\u201f grains can be incorporated into diets, and automated feeding means that \nfeeding can be individually tailored for each cow.  There have also been increases in \nthe milk produced per area of land.  Grass yields have increased as nitrogen \napplication has increased from about 5 kg ha\n-1\n in the 1940s to 120-130 kg ha\n-1\n in 1995 \n(Frame et al., 1995). Although not as extensive as the improvements in cereal yields, \nthere have been improvements in the yield potential of ryegrass species (Cottrill et al., \n2005). \n \nLabour productivity \nAlthough yields per hectare and yields per animal have increased steadily, the greatest \nincrease in productivity has occurred in terms of output per hour of labour employed \n(Figure 4).  This has primarily been achieved by investment in machinery and \nbuildings (Bailey et al., 2004a).   \n \nLabour\nLand\n0\n200\n400\n600\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000\nYear\nO\nu\ntp\nu\nt \nin\nd\ne\nx\n p\ne\nr \nu\nn\nit\n l\na\nb\no\nu\nr \no\nr \nla\nn\nd\n \nFigure 4 Levels of output per unit of land (dashed line) and unit of labour (solid line) \nbetween 1953 and 2000 (1953=100) (Thirtle and Holding, 2003). \n \nIn the crop sector, labour has been substituted by the introduction of chemical weed \ncontrol, the use of wider cultivation, spray and harvesting equipment, and more \npowerful tractors.  The mean power of a tractor in Eastern England increased from 70 \nkW in 1993 to 91 kW in 2003 (Lang, 2004).  In the dairy sector, labour requirements \nper cow have been reduced by automated milking and feeding, and by the \nintroduction of increasingly large mechanised parlours.  The average herd size \nincreased from 25 in 1965 to 74 in 2000 (Garnsworthy and Thomas, 2005).  \nAssociated with these changes, farmers have tended to increase field size.  Across \nseven sites in England the mean field size increased from 5.6 ha in 1945 to 11.1 ha in \n1994 (Westmacott and Worthington, 1997).   During the same time period, the mean \nlength of hedgerows across the seven sites fell from 137 m ha\n-1\n to 102 m ha\n-1\n, and the \n 6 \nnumber of mature and semi-mature trees decreased from 1.2 ha\n-1\n to 0.5 ha\n-1\n \n(Westmacott and Worthington, 1997).   \n \nTotal factor productivity \nTotal factor productivity (TFP) is one of the measures that the UK government uses to \nmonitor the productivity of UK agriculture.  In broad terms, it is an index based on the \nratio of the value of all agricultural outputs to all inputs. It is calculated from the \nlogarithm of the ratio of each input or output from one year to next, which is then \nweighted according to a moving average of the financial value of the input or output \n(Amadi et al. 2004).  The TFP index of UK agriculture showed a steady annual rise \nbetween 1953 and 1984, with the exception of a decline associated with the drought \nof 1976.  By contrast the index remained relatively static between 1984 and 2000 \n(Figure 5).  Moreover, the TFP for the UK has tended to lag behind that of \nneighbouring countries (Table 2).  This is in contrast to the data in Figures 2 and 3 \nwhich suggest that UK wheat and milk productivity has stayed similar to or exceeded \nthat of neighbouring countries. \n \nOutput\nTFP\nInput\n50\n100\n150\n200\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000\nYear\nO\nu\ntp\nu\nt,\n i\nn\np\nu\nt \no\nr \nT\nF\nP\n i\nn\nd\ne\nx\n \nFigure 5 Levels of output index, input index and total factor productivity (solid-line: TFP) \nindex for UK agriculture from 1953 to 2007 (1953=100) (Thirtle and Holding 2003; Defra, \n2008). \n \nTable 2.

In 1996, the incidence of bovine \nspongiform encephalopthy (BSE) and the ban on beef exports severely affected the \n 7 \nlevel of outputs from the beef sector. However the apparent stagnation in productivity \ncould be misleading (Thirtle et al., 2004).  Barnes (2002) explains that a \u201csocial\u201d total \nfactor productivity index, which includes external costs as those arising from nitrate \nand pesticide pollution, would reduce the rate of productivity increase observed \nbetween 1970 and the mid-1980s.  Similarly, environmental improvements after 1984 \nhave increased the \u201csocial\u201d total factor productivity index relative to TFP index \n(Thirtle et al. 2004).  Thirtle et al. (2004) also comment that the total factor \nproductivity calculation assumes that technological changes have a similar effect on \nall inputs.  In practice this is not the case, and over long periods this can cause \nsubstantial bias in the measures.  If these biases are removed, Thirtle and Holding \n(2003) and Bailey et al. (2004b) show that the TFP index continues to increase after \n1984.  Such observations highlight the importance of using such an index with care.   \n \nThe improvement in TPF between 2000 and 2006 was associated with a reduction in \noutput being offset by a greater reduction in inputs such as fertiliser and labour.  The \ndata does not include the 2007-08 increase in cereal prices which, together with the \ncurtailment of compulsory set-aside, induced an increased output of wheat of about 18 \nper cent on the previous three-year average, about 13 per cent of which was \nassociated with increased plantings. This suggests two things - that farmers are \nresponsive to price incentives and there is, at least for the moment, some reserve \ncapacity in the farming sector.  \n \nPotential areas of future technological development \nThis section examines the potential for seven areas of technological innovation to \nimpact changes in land use to 2050.  The first three areas are genetic improvement, \nreducing abiotic and biotic stress, and increasing labour productivity (Figure 1; Table \n3).  The last four areas are changes in agricultural products, waste production, the \neffect on air, water and soil health and biodiversity, and information transfer (Figure \n1; Table 3).   \n \nGenetic improvement \nThe yields of crops and animals are a function of the organism\u201fs genotype, the \nenvironment (including its management), and the interaction of the genotype with the \nenvironment.  Sylvester-Bradley et al. (2005) suggest that current average UK wheat \nyields of about 8 tonnes per hectare could be increased by about 60 per cent to 13 \ntonnes per hectare by 2050.  Cottrill et al. (2005) also consider that current rates of \nimprovement in the yield potential of grass, clover and maize could be maintained.  \nBy contrast in some crops such as potatoes, the focus on quality has meant that \ncurrent progress on increasing yields is small (Allen et al., 2005).   Future yield \nincreases in wheat may focus on increasing the photosynthetic rate during grain \nfilling, in particular by focusing on the catalytic properties of the carbon dioxide-\nfixing enzyme (Austin, 1999).  There may also be opportunities to breed new varieties \nthat can exploit the predicted increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.  \nHowever, breeders will also focus on producing crop varieties or mixtures that are \nless dependent on agrochemicals, and more water and nutrient efficient (Sylvester-\nBradley et al., 2005; Wolfe et al. 2008).  \n 8 \nTable 3.  Seven areas within agricultural systems which can be affected by technological \nchange, example technologies, typical aims in using the technology, and possible effects on \nland use. \n \nArea Example technologies Typical aim in using the \ntechnology \nEffect on land use \n1.

Information \ntransfer and \nuse \nComputerisation \nBiosensors \nTo improve decision making \nby farmers and consumers \nUsually incremental \n \n \nIn ruminant production, increasing low reproductive rates is likely to be a key target \nas 50 to 70 per cent of the food energy is required to maintain the parental population, \ncompared to 4 per cent in broiler production (Sinclair and Webb, 2005).  In the \nproduction of lean beef, the effective strategy of breeding and selecting larger and \nlater-maturing cattle is likely to continue (Garnsworthy & Thomas, 2005).  A key \nfeature of the current progress in pig breeding has been the use of unbiased statistical \ntechniques and a move away from \u201cpedigree\u201d breeding (Wiseman et al., 2005).  The \ngenetic potential within aquaculture is seen as being particular great, as breeding has \nonly had an impact on about 10 generations (Haley and Archibald, 2005).   \n \nDuring the 20th century, most breeding work was undertaken by identifying suitable \nparents within a species and selecting for desirable attributes amongst their progeny.  \nNew genetic technologies such as gene mapping and the use of gene markers have \nbeen helpful in streamlining the process of identifying and selecting individuals with \ndesirable alleles (Haley and Archibald, 2005; Dennis et al. 2008).  In many countries, \nplant breeders have also used genetic modification to transfer a desired gene from one \n 9 \nindividual to another without the risk of transferring possible undesirable genes.  The \nprocess also allows desirable genes to be transferred from one species to another.   \n \nGaskell et al. (2000) reports on a 1999 Eurobarometer survey (16,082 respondents) \ncovering each EU state which showed that Europeans were not antagonistic to genetic \ntechnologies per se, but that the perceived \u201cusefulness\u201d of genetically modifying \ncrops was balanced by perceived downside risks.  In the case of genetically modified \nfood and animal cloning, there was little appreciation of usefulness but a great \nappreciation of the risks.  In 2004, the European Union lifted its moratorium on \napproving new genetically modified crops, which are examined on a case-by-case \nbasis.  However, general acceptance of genetic modification is likely to be dependent \non the processes and products providing clear societal and environmental benefits \n(Dennis et al., 2008; O\u201fBrien and Mullins, 2008).  Moreover, where and when genetic \nmodified crops are introduced, crop management practices such as length of rotation \nor unsprayed patches may be imposed as part of a package of measures to increase the \necological sustainability of the system (Firbank and Forcella, 2000; Dennis et al., \n2008).  \n \nReducing abiotic and biotic stress \nIn 2005, the non-genetic constraints to increasing UK wheat yields were considered to \nbe largely economic and environmental rather than technological (Sylvester-Bradley \net al., 2005).  Low cereal prices at that time meant that farmers were applying lower \namounts of potassium, phosphorus and sulphur than were required for maximum \nyields per hectare (Legg, 2005), or to replenish soil stocks (Potash Development \nAssociation, 2009).  Looking forward to the next 50 years, greater attention is needed \nto the future availability and cost of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus, which are \nclosely related to oil and commodity prices (Piesse and Thirtle, 2009).  Predicted \nreductions in summer rainfall could lead to a greater restriction on the availability of \nwater for irrigation, and to changes in irrigation technology and crop selection (Knox \nand Weatherhead, 2005).   \n \nIn all crop production systems, the reduction of weeds, pests and diseases potentially \ncreates a dynamic ecological process which favours the development of resistant \nweeds, pest and diseases.  So commercial farmers will continue to rely on the steady \narrival of new technologies such as new fungicides and resistant crop varieties to \ncounteract the natural selection of resistant strains.  Technologies such as Integrated \nPest Management and mixed cropping can also be useful in encouraging natural \npredators and reducing the selection pressure.   \n \nA key technological innovation to reduce stress and injury is to raise crops and \nanimals in buildings where the environment can be regulated.  Between 1960 and \n1995, the proportion of inputs invested in buildings and land improvement increased \nbetween three- and four-fold (Thirtle et al., 2004).  Similar developments may \ncontinue, while higher temperatures may increase the need for shading in livestock \nsystems, either by using tree cover or buildings.  One current example of building \ninvestment is the Thanet Earth development in Kent. Here the largest greenhouse \ncomplex in the UK is being constructed alongside a combined heat and power plant.  \nThe aim is to boost Britain\u201fs salad crop production by 15 per cent from this one \nsite(Thanet Earth, 2009).  As the government seeks to increase the use of combined \nheat and power, there will be similar opportunities at other locations. \n 10 \n \nWithin the livestock sector, reducing yield losses due to stress and injury is closely \nlinked to animal welfare; for example mastitis and lameness are the principal reasons \nfor the premature culling of dairy cattle (Garnsworthy and Thomas, 2005).  \nGovernment regulation, such as the phasing out of the use of battery cages in egg \nproduction, can stimulate technological innovation and new land uses such as \nwoodland-based egg-production systems.  Similarly the introduction of the EU\u201fs \nintegrated pollution prevention and control directive has made it extremely \nunattractive to establish pig units with more than 650 sows (Wiseman et al. 2005).    \nWelfare could also become a key driver for genetic improvement, such as the \nselection of hens that show less cannibalism and pecking and greater bone strength \n(Hester, 2005). Although bovine somatotropin has been used to increase the milk \nyields of dairy cows in the USA, the use of this growth hormone is not permitted in \nthe European Union on animal welfare grounds.   \n \nLabour productivity \nThere is little published research on predicted future changes in labour productivity. \nIn the absence of other evidence, it is assumed here that the steady historical increase \nin productivity will continue.  In some agricultural sectors it remains difficult to \nrecruit staff and often labour is brought from outside the UK.  In cropping systems, \nincreases in labour productivity tend to be associated with wider cultivation \nequipment, sprayers and combines.  In livestock production, labour productivity tends \nto increase with larger and more intensive systems, although such systems can face \nenvironmental, health and regulatory constraints.  In the arable sector, the figures \nsuggest appears that farm size and ownership are remaining relatively constant \n(Thirtle et al. 2004), but anecdotal evidence is that actual crop management is \nincreasingly undertaken by larger farm businesses or contractors which can minimise \nmachinery costs by working across a number of farms.  One of the few areas where \nlabour productivity may be stable is within individual allotments and gardens, where \nfood production may be partly a recreational activity. \n \nNew agricultural products  \nThe greatest changes in land use are often associated with the introduction of new \nproducts, or changes in the mix of existing products.  For example, as mentioned \nearlier, the introduction of new baking technology encouraged the expansion of the \nUK wheat area, while the arrival of new varieties of oilseed rape with low \nconcentrations of erucic acid and glucosinolates allowed the use of oilseed rape as an \nanimal feed.  Three key drivers of potential changes in the agricultural product mix \nare energy security, climate change, and health awareness. \n \nConcerns over energy security and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have \ncreated increased interest in the use of bioenergy crops. This could cause a step \nchange in land use (Schmidhuber, 2006).  Although the capacity to produce bioenergy \nis considered too small to affect energy prices, the energy market has created a floor \nprice for many arable crops (Schmidhuber, 2006).  As the world price for energy \nincreases, the floor price for these crops also increases.  (High energy prices also \nincrease the cost of key agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and diesel).  However, \nSchmidhuber also points out that if substantial quantities of land-based products are \nused in the energy sector, energy prices will also create a ceiling price for some \ncommodities. For example, an oil-price reduction would reduce the amount of wheat \n 11 \nconverted to bioethanol and thereby reduce the wheat price. Assuming minimal \ngovernment intervention, the net effect of these linkages on UK land use will depend \non the relative costs and competiveness of UK bioenergy crops with internationally-\ntraded bioenergy crops and fossil energy.  Some early systems have focused on \nexisting crops such as wheat, sugar beet and oilseed rape.  However, breeding and \nresearch work is also piloting second-generation non-food perennial crops such as \nmiscanthus, willow, and switchgrass which require fewer nutrients.  In each case, the \nwidespread uptake of such crops could have a major impact on land availability, water \nresources, and the landscape (Powlson et al., 2005).  \n   \nIn response to high concentrations of greenhouse gases, the UK appears to be \nexperiencing higher temperatures and a decrease in summer rainfall (Jenkins et al., \n2008).  Such changes will favour new species to the UK such as sunflowers, and \nspecies which use the C4-phosynthetic pathway such as maize and miscanthus.  In the \nhorticulture sector, the UK could grow a wider selection of vegetable and fruit crops, \nand vineyards and orchards could become a more dominant feature in the British \nlandscape.  By contrast selected indigenous tree species, which form an important \ncomponent of the British rural landscape, may decline in response to the changing \nclimate and increased pressure from pests and diseases.   \n \nThe third key driver in the future demand of agricultural products is human health.  \nHigh levels of obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases in the UK have \nbeen linked with a lack of exercise and unhealthy diets.  Future crop varieties could \nfocus on nutritional attributes such as a low glycaemic index or a particular amino \nacid or fatty acid combination (Dennis et al. 2008).  Amongst other factors, a healthy \ndiet is considered to have low levels of saturated fat   Because more than half of the \nsaturated fatty acids in the UK diet arise from animal-derived products, Cottrill et al. \n(2005) argue that breeding and management innovations should focus on improved \nfatty acid profiles in milk and meat products.  Conversely, an increased emphasis on \nhealth, diet, and \u201cecological footprinting\u201d could result in result in a greater emphasis \non crop-based rather than animal-based products.   \n \nReducing waste \nOver the next 50 years, the term \u201cwaste\u201d may become obsolete as technological \ninnovation seeks to close the loops within agricultural systems.  Many waste products \ncan be used as energy feedstocks, and with suitable treatment some wastes can be \nused as organic fertilisers.  There will also be a drive to reduce waste in the food \nchain. Whereas in the 1970s, about 6 per cent of total food was wasted in the home \n(Wenlock et al. 1980), it is now estimated that almost one third of household food \npurchases by weight are discarded as waste (WRAP, 2008), accounting for almost 20 \nper cent of the total tonnage of household waste.  About half of this wasted food is fit \nfor consumption (WRAP, 2008).  It is estimated that a further 12 per cent is wasted \nwithin the food and drink industry, although some is recovered for other uses such as \nanimal feed (Hyde et al., 2001).   Technological innovations such as improving the \nshelf-life of food could reduce waste, but probably the greatest savings are to be \nachieved through changes in household purchasing behaviour and kitchen \nmanagement (WRAP, 2008).  \n \nEnhancing air, water, and soil quality and biodiversity \n 12 \nBetween 1985 and 2007, in a market where food prices were relatively low, the focus \nof public-funded research and technological innovation moved away from \nproductivity enhancement to issues such as animal welfare and ways of improving air, \nwater and soil quality, and biodiversity (Piesse and Thirtle, 2009).  One example is \nprecision farming, which can create environmental benefits from the better targeting \nof nitrogen applications (Welsh et al. 2003) and herbicides (Berge et al. 2009).  \nMinimum or conservation tillage, whilst offering some benefits in terms of reduced \nlabour costs, is also promoted as a way of improving carbon sequestration and soil \nfertility and biodiversity (Bradbury and Kirby, 2006).  Other mechanisms to reduce \npollution to water courses and increase biodiversity include the establishment of best \nmanagement practices (Goulding et al. 2008), and the establishment of buffer strips \nand conservation areas.   \n \nOver the next 50 years, measures to reduce net carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and \nmethane emissions from agriculture will be particularly critical (Glendining et al., \n2009), and the UK government has already set targets for the sector.  Using US-based \ndata between 1944 and 2007, Capper et al (2009) have shown how technological \nadvances in dairying have reduced the amount of manure, methane and nitrous oxide \nto produce a given quantity of milk by 24 per cent, 43 per cent and 56 per cent \nrespectively.  Maintaining production from reduced animal numbers is seen as a key \nbasis for reducing net emissions of greenhouse gases.  There may also be a move \ntowards indoor systems where animal wastes can be stored, and where nutritional \ninputs can be more closely matched to minimise nitrogen excretion (Garnsworthy, \n2005). \n \nInformation transfer and use \nInformation transfer and use are likely to continue to be a key area of technological \ninnovation.  Innovations such as the internet can provide the farmer with a greater \nunderstanding of consumer requirements.  Computer-based models and tools can also \nimprove on-farm decision making regarding the use of fertilisers and organic manures \n(Goulding et al., 2008), planning crop-protection schedules, or formulating the most \nappropriate feed mix.  But information is increasingly a key aspect of the product sold \nby the farm as well as being a management tool.  At various points in the supply chain \nfrom the farmer, the supermarket and others will seek information such as the carbon \nfootprint, the use of pesticides or medicines, and the location and time of production.  \nTechnologies such as electronic identification systems, which improve traceability in \nrelation to livestock disease (Webb et al., 2005) and agrochemical use (Peets et al., \n2009), may become more common.  Consumers will also become increasingly aware \nof tools such as life cycle assessments (LCAs) which will allow them to compare the \nenvironmental impact and energy burden of different products or different agricultural \nsystems such as conventional and organic agriculture (Williams et al. 2006; Day et al., \n2008; Glendining et al. 2009).   \n \n \nCapacity to release land from agricultural production \nThe final section of this paper considers the combined effect of these technologies on \na possible national need to take additional land into agricultural production, or the \nnational capacity to release agricultural land for other uses.  Glendining et al. (2009) \nhave shown that for a specified output, relatively intense agricultural production is \ngenerally optimal for the environment because it does not necessitate the conversion \n 13 \nof non-agricultural land with a high environmental value. Many of the technological \ninnovations described above will increase land productivity and thereby (assuming a \ngiven demand) increase the proportion of land that can be released from agricultural \nproduction (Sylvester-Bradley and Wiseman, 2005).  Such land can then be used to \ndeliver other ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) such as \nhabitat conservation and opportunities for recreation and carbon sequestration.   \n \nBetween 1992 and 2006, the reduced need to allocate land to crop production at a \nEuropean level allowed between 5 and 10 per cent of the arable land to be \u201cset aside\u201d, \nand the European Union was able to draw on this land bank after the increase in \ncommodity prices of 2007-08.  During the next 50 years, continued improvements in \ntechnology will be pivotal in providing flexibility in future land use decisions in the \nface of increased demands for crop and animal products.  However, the amount of \nland released in lowland England and Wales and the implementation of technological \nchange will also depend on government interventions and international trade (Table \n4).   \n \nTable 4. Predicted effect of \u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d and four other intervention scenarios on the \nchange in technical efficiency, self-sufficiency and the use of lowland agricultural land in \nEngland and Wales for agriculture, in 2050 relative to 2000-2004 values (derived from Morris \net al., 2005). \n \nScenario Intervention regime Change in \ntechnical \nefficiency\na\n \nChange in self \nsufficiency\nb\n \nChange in \nland use for \nagriculture\nc\n  \nBusiness as \nusual \nAgricultural support as in 2002 +19 per cent +6 per cent -20 per cent \nWorld  \nmarkets \nZero: market-driven free trade +34 per cent - 3 per cent -34 per cent \nNational \nenterprise \nModerate to high: protected domestic \nmarkets with limited environmental \nconcern \n+39 per cent +26 per cent -18 per cent \nGlobal \nsustainability \nLow: market orientation with \ntargeted sustainability compliance \n+12 per cent + 8 per cent -2 per cent \nLocal \nstewardship \nHigh: locally defined schemes \nreflecting local priorities \n-7 per cent + 23 per cent 0 per cent \na\n Mean technical efficiency (i.e. yield per hectare or yield per head) for five crop and five livestock \ncommodities (pg 29; Morris et al. 2005). \nb\n Mean level of self-sufficiency expressed as the ratio between production and consumption of twelve \ncommodities (page 49; Morris et al. 2005). \nc\n Including land in set-aside in 2002 and assuming no energy crops (page 38; Morris et al. 2005).  \n \nMorris et al. (2005) as part of a study of \u201cAgricultural Futures and Implications for \nthe Environment\u201d estimated agricultural changes in England and Wales by 2050 \nassuming that government intervention and international trade continued as if it was \n\u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d (Table 4).  Relative to the \u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d scenario, and \nassuming no energy cropping, a greater focus on free trade (World Markets Scenario) \nwas associated with additional increases in technical efficiency and about a third of \ncurrent lowland agricultural land was predicted to be released from production.   A \nprotectionist trade policy (the National Enterprise scenario) was also predicted to \nincrease technical efficiency and self-sufficiency and to release about 18 per cent of \nlowland agricultural land from intensive production.  In the last two scenarios (Global \nSustainability and Local Stewardship), self sufficiency was predicted to increase, but \n 14 \nconstraints on the increase in technical efficiency meant that all current lowland \nagricultural land would be required for agriculture.  There is probably a need to \nupdate this research in the light of recent developments, but the overall analysis \nhighlights a generally positive relationship between increased agricultural technology \nand the national capacity to release agricultural land for other uses.       \n \nConclusions \nTechnological innovations which improve the efficiency with which land and other \nresources are used are probably the most useful tools we have as we seek to manage \nthe balance between the well-being of people and the maintenance of the global \necosystem.  Public and private investment in improved agricultural technology is \ncritical if future generations are to have flexibility in decisions regarding land use.     \n \nWe do not know how global agricultural production will be affected by future \nchanges in climate, and in the trade policies of national governments.  In addition, the \ninteractions between technological innovation, food security and the proportion of UK \nland released for other uses are complex. However, the spike in the price of \ncommodities between 2007 and 2008 provides a stark reminder of the advantages of \nretaining capacity within the UK agricultural system.  \n \nThe relatively low food prices of the past 20 years have allowed society to focus on \nthe multifunctional nature of agricultural land use.  In such an environment, IAASTD \n(2009) has argued that appropriate implementation of agricultural technology (for \nexample genetic modification of crops or the introduction of biofuels) requires \ngovernmental facilitation of interactive stakeholder networks.  Such workshops will \ncontinue to be essential in the future. \n \nIn the UK, technological innovation has been particularly successful in improving \nlabour productivity.  However, the published research on labour productivity is sparse \ncompared to the technical issues.  In addition, current methods and tools for \ncomparing the relative productivity of agriculture in the UK with that in other \ncountries can raise as many questions as they answer.  \n \nFuture technological advances can be divided into two categories: incremental and \nstep changes.  With appropriate investment, it would appear possible to maintain \nincremental increases in crop and animal yields, in soil and water quality, and in \nfarmland biodiversity.   By contrast, changes in the mix of products being produced \ncan cause step changes in land-use.  Three key areas are: \n\u25cf The market for bio-energy based on existing crops, bespoke energy crops and \nagricultural waste.    \n\u25cf The direct effects of climate change on UK production and production in \ncountries from which we currently import food, together with the effects of \nregulations to control greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector. \n\u25cf Whilst it is difficult to change human nature, there may yet be step changes in the \ndiet of the UK population, as well as opportunities to reduce the current high \nlevels of food waste. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe acknowledge helpful advice from two anonymous reviewers. \n 15 \n \nReferences \nAllen, E.J., Allison, M.F. & Sparkes, D.L.
