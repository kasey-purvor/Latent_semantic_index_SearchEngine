INTRODUCTION\nSpiral waves have been observed in various biolog-\nical, chemical and physical systems [1], as well as in\nnumerical simulations of reaction-diffusion systems and\ncomplex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equations. Part of their fas-\ncination is due to the intriguing instabilities they ex-\nhibit: For instance, spirals may begin to meander or to\ndrift, a scenario that has been observed in the Belousov\u2013\nZhabotinsky reaction [2], during fibrillations in cardiac\ntissue [3], and in the oxidation of carbon-monoxide on\nplatinum surfaces [4], and that has been attributed to\na supercritical Hopf bifurcation [5]. Of particular rele-\nvance to this paper is spiral breakup where the core [6]\nor the far field [7, 8] of a spiral wave breaks up into\na turbulent region with complex spatio-temporal behav-\nior. Other interesting instabilities are spatio-temporal\nperiod-doubling bifurcations, which have been observed\nin the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction [9] and in numeri-\ncal simulations [10], and transverse instabilities [11] that\nare characterized by a degenerate dispersion relation be-\ntween asymptotic wavelength and wave speed.\nAmong the challenges for theoretical studies of spirals\nare the tasks of investigating the nature of the above\ninstabilities and making predictions about the patterns\nemerging from them. The first step toward these goals\nis to understand spiral spectra as they inform us about\nthe stability or instability of a spiral and, through the\nassociated eigenmodes, about the spatio-temporal be-\nhavior associated with unstable modes. Spiral spectra\nare composed of two disjoint sets: a discrete part con-\nsisting of isolated point eigenvalues, and a continuous\npart consisting of curves (for planar spirals) or of densely\ndistributed eigenvalues (for spirals on large disks). Iso-\nlated point eigenvalues depend genuinely on the spiral in\n\u2217Electronic address: b.sandstede@surrey.ac.uk\n\u2020Electronic address: scheel@math.umn.edu\nthe sense that their location is determined by the spi-\nral shape between core and far field; in general, their\ncomputation therefore requires knowledge of the entire\ntwo-dimensional spiral. In contrast, the continuous part\nof the spectrum depends only on the asymptotic one-\ndimensional profile of the spiral in the far field. It is also\nknown, for instance from Ref. [12], that point eigenval-\nues and absolute instabilities caused by the continuous\npart of the spectrum produce very different scaling laws\nand bifurcation diagrams near onset. It is therefore desir-\nable to develop analytical criteria that allow us to decide\nwhether spirals destabilize due to discrete or continuous\nparts of their spectrum.\nIn this paper, we show that spiral spectra may contain\nmany isolated point eigenvalues whose approximate lo-\ncation can be predicted from the asymptotic wave trains\nupon accounting properly for curvature effects in the re-\ngion between core and far field. Specifically, we show that\nthe linearization about a planar spiral wave near double\nroots (or branch points) of its linear dispersion relation\ncan be reduced to a one-dimensional Schro\u00a8dinger opera-\ntor with a complex long-range potential. Depending on\na sign condition on its coefficients, this Schro\u00a8dinger oper-\nator has infinitely many bound states which correspond\nto isolated point eigenvalues of the spiral. These eigen-\nvalues can shift the onset to instability, and our result\npredicts precisely when such a shift occurs.\nWe apply our analyses to a modified FitzHugh\u2013\nNagumo equation and the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau\nequation: Our theoretical results turn out to be in ex-\ncellent agreement with the recent spectral computations\nby Barkley and Wheeler [13] for the modified FitzHugh\u2013\nNagumo equation, which in fact motivated our study.\nFurthermore, we show that spiral waves in the complex\nGinzburg\u2013Landau equation can possess discrete eigenval-\nues generated by curvature effects and that these eigen-\nvalues lead to a shift of the onset of spiral instability into\nthe regime where the asymptotic wave trains are only\nconvectively unstable.\n2II. SPIRAL SPECTRA\nTo set the scene, we assume that u\u2217(r, \u03d5\u2212\u03c9t), written\nin polar coordinates, is a rigidly-rotating Archimedean\nspiral wave with nonzero angular velocity \u03c9 of the\nreaction-diffusion system\nut = D\u2206u+ f(u), u \u2208 Rn, (1)\nwhere (x, y) lies in R2 or in large disks BR(0) of radius\nR\u00c0 1 with, say, Neumann boundary conditions. We as-\nsume that the diffusion matrixD is invertible but empha-\nsize that our analysis applies, under certain conditions, to\nsystems for which some of the diffusion coefficients van-\nish (see Eq. (20) below for an example). A typical spiral\nwave is shown in Fig. 1. In particular, the asymptotic\nprofile of a spiral in the far field away from its core is lo-\ncally of the form u0(\u03bar+\u03d5\u2212\u03c9t), where u0 is 2pi-periodic\nin its argument; we refer to Eq. (7)-(8) for the precise\nfar-field asymptotics of u\u2217. The function u0(\u03bax \u2212 \u03c9t) is\na planar wave that satisfies Eq. (1) on R2. Linearizing\nEq. (1) about this planar wave gives\nwt = D\u2206w + fu(u0(\u03bax\u2212 \u03c9t))w, (x, y) \u2208 R2. (2)\nIn the following, we focus on longitudinal instabilities of\nthe wave train which are captured by the ansatz\nw = e\u03bbt+\u03bdxw0(\u03bax\u2212 \u03c9t; \u03bd),\nwhere \u03bb, \u03bd \u2208 C and w0(\u03d1; \u03bd) is 2pi-periodic in \u03d1. Sub-\nstitution into Eq. (2) yields the linear dispersion relation\n\u03bb\u2217(\u03bd) of the wave train in the propagation direction and\nits group velocity cg = \u2212d\u03bb\u2217\/d\u03bd|\u03bd=0 \u2208 R in the labora-\ntory frame. As we shall see below, the linear dispersion\nrelation in the transverse direction is not relevant to our\nspectral analysis, but will nevertheless affect the spatial\nspiral asymptotics given in Eq. (7)\u2013(8) below. We there-\nfore also introduce the ansatz\nw = e\u03bbt+\u03bdyw\u22a50 (\u03bax\u2212 \u03c9t; \u03bd) (3)\nwith \u03bb, \u03bd \u2208 C and w\u22a50 (\u03d1; \u03bd) being 2pi-periodic in \u03d1, to get\nthe linear dispersion relation \u03bb\u22a5\u2217 (\u03bd) = d\u22a5\u03bd\n2 + O(\u03bd3) in\nthe transverse direction.\nTo relate these quantities to the spectrum of the spiral,\nwe shall work in the corotating frame \u03d5 7\u2192 \u03d5+\u03c9t in which\nEq. (1) becomes\nut = D\u2206u+ \u03c9\u2202\u03d5u+ f(u). (4)\nThe eigenvalue problem associated with the spiral u\u2217 is\nthen given by\n\u03bbu = D\u2206u+ \u03c9\u2202\u03d5u+ fu(u\u2217(r, \u03d5))u. (5)\nWe now briefly summarize the results established in\nRefs. [14, 15]. Throughout, we reserve the term point\neigenvalue to denote eigenvalues with finite multiplicity\nthat are isolated uniformly in the disk radius R.\nFIG. 1: Contour plots of 2D spiral waves of the FitzHugh\u2013\nNagumo equation (20) computed on squares with Neumann\nboundary conditions are shown.

(ii) Spectra of spirals on\ndisks BR(0) with R\u00c0 1. See text for details.\nOn R2, spiral spectra consist of point eigenvalues,\namong them eigenvalues at 0 and \u00b1i\u03c9 which are enforced\nby the rotation and translation symmetry of the plane,\nand the essential spectrum \u03a3ess, which is bounded by the\nlinear dispersion curves \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217(i\u03b3) + i\u03c9` with \u03b3 \u2208 R and\n` \u2208 Z (see Fig. 2(i)). The vertical periodicity with period\n\u03c9 of the essential spectrum in the complex plane arises\nsince the essential spectrum is determined entirely by the\nlimiting eigenvalue problem for r \u2192\u221e: In this limit, the\ndiffusion operator \u2206 is replaced by \u2202rr, and the eigen-\nvalue problem (5) acquires an additional symmetry due\nto the term \u03c9\u2202\u03d5 which acts by replacing eigenmodes w\nand spectrum \u03bb by w exp(i`\u03d5) and \u03bb+ i\u03c9`, respectively.\nOn the other hand, on disks BR(0) of radius R, spiral\nspectra converge as R \u2192 \u221e to the union of the abso-\nlute spectrum \u03a3abs and point eigenvalues (see Fig. 2(ii)).\nThe absolute spectrum consists of all elements \u03bb \u2208 C for\nwhich the equation \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd)+ i\u03c9` has two roots \u03bd1 and\n\u03bd2 with equal real part that have the correct Morse index\n(see Refs. [14, 15] for details). It is therefore determined\nsolely by the asymptotic one-dimensional wave trains and\nagain vertically periodic in the complex \u03bb-plane with pe-\nriod \u03c9. The edges of the absolute spectrum are given by\nbranch points \u03bbbp of the linear dispersion relation where,\nby definition, the two roots \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 become equal to\neach other to form a double root of \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd): In other words,\n\u03bbbp = \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd1) + i\u03c9` and d\u03bb\u2217\/d\u03bd(\u03bd1) = 0. The absolute\nspectrum itself is not spectrum, but each of its elements\nis approximated by infinitely many eigenvalues of (5) as\nR \u2192 \u221e; the convergence toward the absolute spectrum\n3\u03a3abs\n\u03a3ess\n(i) (ii)\nFIG. 3: Spiral spectra computed by Barkley and Wheeler [13]\nfor the FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo equation (20) near core (i) and far-\nfield (ii) breakup on disks of radius R = 20, 40, 80, indicated\nby different symbols and colors [Reproduced with permission].\nThe absolute and essential spectra shown in the above plots\nwere previously computed in Ref. [14].\nis algebraic of order 1\/R in R. While the absolute spec-\ntrum does not depend on the boundary conditions, the\nactual eigenvalues near it will. The point eigenvalues,\nwhich make up the remaining part of the spectrum, have\nlimits as R \u2192 \u221e, which are approached exponentially\nfast of order exp(\u2212\u03b1R) in R, and these limiting elements\ncontain all eigenvalues and resonance poles of the spiral\non R2 plus possibly additional eigenvalues induced by the\nboundary conditions.\nThe theoretical predictions for spiral spectra on large\ndisks were recently corroborated by numerical computa-\ntions, summarized in Fig. 3, by Barkley and Wheeler [13],\nwhich confirm in particular the clustering of eigenval-\nues along the absolute spectrum. In addition, however,\ntheir computations show that certain point eigenvalues\nappear to be intimately linked to the absolute spectrum\nby aligning themselves along rays that emerge from the\nedges of the absolute spectrum. As visible in Fig. 3(ii),\nthis phenomenon seems to occur along each branch of\nthe absolute spectrum (recall that the absolute spectrum\nis vertically periodic with period \u03c9). These observations\nare surprising as point eigenvalues are determined by the\nshape of the spiral in the region between core and far\nfield rather than by the far field itself.\nIn this paper, we explain the occurrence of these point\neigenvalues in terms of curvature corrections to the spi-\nral shape in an intermediate spatial regime between core\nand far field which manifest themselves as a long-range\npotential in Eq. (5). Our analysis provides criteria which\ndetermine whether instabilities such as core or far-field\nbreakup are caused by the absolute spectrum or by point\neigenvalues arising through curvature effects. We shall\nfocus on spirals on R2 since point eigenvalues persist on\ndisks of finite but large radius R, independently of the\nboundary conditions.\nIII. REDUCTION TO SCHRO\u00a8DINGER\nEQUATIONS\nWe now reduce the eigenvalue problem of a pla-\nnar spiral wave near branch points to a non-selfadjoint\nSchro\u00a8dinger operator with a complex long-range poten-\ntial. The result is given toward the end of this section in\nEq. (13).\nIt will be convenient to write the steady-state equation\nfor Eq. (4) on R2 in polar coordinates:\nD\n[\nurr +\nur\nr\n+\nu\u03d5\u03d5\nr2\n]\n+ \u03c9u\u03d5 + f(u) = 0. (6)\nTo capture point eigenvalues, we need to expand the\nspiral wave in the far field as r \u2192 \u221e. Using the\nArchimedean coordinate\n\u03d1 = \u03d5+ \u03bar + \u03b81 log r, (7)\nwhere the constant \u03b81 is to be determined, the spiral wave\nu\u2217(r, \u03d1) has, for sufficiently large r \u00c0 1, the expansion\nu\u2217(r, \u03d1) = u0(\u03d1) +\n1\nr\nu1(\u03d1) + O(1\/r2), (8)\nu1(\u03d1) = bu\u20320(\u03d1) + \u03b81\u2202\u03bau0(\u03d1) +\n\u03ba\n2\n\u2202\u03bd\u03bdw\n\u22a5\n0 (\u03d1; 0).\nHere, \u03b81 = \u03bad\u22a5\/cg, w\u22a50 has been introduced in Eq. (3),\n\u2202\u03bau0 refers to the derivative of the wave train profile\nwith respect to its spatial wave number \u03ba, and b \u2208 R is\na constant that is determined by a compatibility condi-\ntion at order 1\/r2. The expansion (8) can be verified by\nsubstituting it into Eq. (6) and expanding in powers of\n1\/r. Writing the eigenvalue problem (5) as a first-order\nsystem in the Archimedean variables, we obtain\nur = \u2212\n(\n\u03ba+\n\u03b81\nr\n)\nu\u03d1 + v (9)\nvr = \u2212u\u03d1\u03d1\nr2\n+D\u22121 [\u03bb\u2212 \u03c9\u2202\u03d1 \u2212 fu(u\u2217(r, \u03d1))]u\n\u2212\n(\n\u03ba+\n\u03b81\nr\n)\nv\u03d1 \u2212 v\nr\n,\nwhich, using the expansion (8), is of the form\nUr =\n[\nA0(\u03bb) +\n1\nr\nA1(\u03bb) + O\n(\n1\nr2\n)]\nU, U =\n(\nu\nv\n)\n,\n(10)\nwhere the operators Aj act on functions U = (u, v) that\nare 2pi-periodic in \u03d1. Since all eigenmodes are necessarily\nsmooth in the \u03d1-direction, the u\u03d1\u03d1\/r2 terms in Eq. (9)\ncan be considered as higher-order corrections that do not\ncause any regularity problems.\nUpon taking the limit r \u2192 \u221e in Eq. (9)\u2013(10), we\nrecover the eigenvalue problem of the asymptotic wave\ntrain. In particular, a direct computation shows that \u03bd\nis an eigenvalue of A0(\u03bb), given by\nA0(\u03bb) =\n( \u2212\u03ba\u2202\u03d1 1\nD\u22121 [\u03bb\u2212 \u03c9\u2202\u03d1 \u2212 fu(u0(\u03d1))] \u2212\u03ba\u2202\u03d1\n)\n,\n4if, and only if, it is a root of the linear dispersion of\nthe asymptotic wave train, i.e. if \u03bb and \u03bd are related via\n\u03bb = \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd).\nSuppose now that \u03bbbp \u2208 C is a branch point of the lin-\near dispersion relation \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd) of the spiral wave with dou-\nble roots \u03bd1 = \u03bd2. Interpreted in the context of Eq. (10),\nthis assumption means that A0(\u03bbbp) has a double eigen-\nvalue \u03bd1 = \u03bd2. We shall assume that the double eigen-\nvalue \u03bd1,2 has geometric multiplicity one, which is the\ngeneric case.\nOur goal is now to reduce Eq. (10) to a simpler scalar\nequation for \u03bb near \u03bbbp. Thus, we employ the perturba-\ntion ansatz\nU(r) = e\u03bd1rV (r), \u03bb = \u03bbbp + \u039b, \u03bd = \u03bd1 + V,\nso that Eq. (10) becomes\nVr =\n[\nA0 \u2212 \u03bd1 + 1\nr\nA1 +O\n(\n1\nr2\n)]\nV, (11)\nwhere A0\u2212\u03bd1 evaluated at \u039b = 0 now has a double eigen-\nvalue at V = 0 with geometric multiplicity one. In par-\nticular, we can apply center-manifold theory to Eq. (11)\nfor \u039b and 1\/r close to zero, which shows that we can\nreduce Eq. (11) to an equation of the form\nWr =\n[(\n0 1\n\u039b\/d 0\n)\n+\n1\nr\nB1 +O\n(\n1\nr2\n)]\nW, (12)\nwhere W = (W1,W2) \u2208 C2, for a certain complex coeffi-\ncient d \u2208 C and a complex 2\u00d7 2 matrix B1. The compo-\nnents W1 and W2 of W can be thought of as being the\namplitudes of the eigenmode and the generalized eigen-\nmode, respectively, associated with the double eigenvalue\nV = 0 of the right-hand side of Eq. (11) at \u039b = 0.\nEquation (12) is equivalent to a second-order equation\nfor W1. Upon removing the \u2202rW1 term in this second-\norder equation by an appropriate coordinate transfor-\nmation, we finally arrive at the scalar non-selfadjoint\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation\ndwrr +\n[\na\nr\n+O\n(\n1\nr2\n)]\nw = \u039bw, r \u2208 [R0,\u221e) (13)\nfor the variable w, which corresponds to the transformed\nW1. Here, R0 \u00c0 1 is determined by the region of valid-\nity of the center-manifold reduction, while the coefficient\na \u2208 C describing the strength of the complex long-range\npotential in Eq. (13) is determined from the entries of\nthe matrix B1 in Eq. (12).\nEquation (13) describes the eigenvalue problem of the\nspiral wave in the far field. To obtain genuine eigen-\nmodes of the spiral wave, we need to match its solutions\nto the eigenvalue problem in the core region. We have\ncarried out this matching process in Ref. [15] for fronts\nin reaction-diffusion equations and summarized the nec-\nessary modifications for spirals in Ref. [14]. Therefore,\nwe shall omit the details here. The result of the match-\ning with the core is an effective boundary condition for\nEq. (13) at r = R0 of the form\ns1(\u039b)w(R0) + s2(\u039b)wr(R0) = 0 (14)\nwhich provides the correct coupling to the eigenvalue\nproblem near the spiral core. The complex-valued func-\ntions s1 and s2 depend smoothly on \u039b, and satisfy\n|s1|2 + |s2|2 6= 0 near \u039b = 0.\nIn summary, to determine the spectrum of the spiral\nwave near the branch point \u03bbbp, it suffices to find the\nspectrum of the Schro\u00a8dinger operator given in Eq. (13)\nsubject to the boundary condition (14). Before turning\nto the point spectrum of (13)\u2013(14), we shall discuss the\ninterpretation of the coefficients a and d.\nThe continuous spectrum of (13) is given by the ray\n\u039b = \u2212d\u03b32 with \u03b3 \u2208 R as it is determined entirely by\nthe limiting problem at r = \u221e. By construction, this\nspectrum must coincide with the absolute spectrum of\nthe spiral wave near the branch point \u03bbbp. The algorithm\nfor the computation of the absolute spectrum of spirals\noutlined in Ref. [14] therefore allows us to calculate d\nnumerically.\nThe coefficient a is determined as follows. Since\nd(1\/r)\/dr = O(1\/r2), we can treat the variable 1\/r in\nEq. (11) for r \u00c0 1 as a slowly varying parameter. In par-\nticular, to compute the reduced vector field on the cen-\nter manifold of Eq. (11) to leading order, we can simply\nconsider 1\/r as a small parameter, rather than treating\nEq. (11) as a genuinely non-autonomous system. This\nobservation allows us to make the following argument.\nTruncating Eq. (13) at order 1\/r and rewriting the re-\nsulting equation as a first-order system yields\nW\u02dcr =\n(\n0 1\n1\nd\n(\n\u039b\u2212 ar\n)\n0\n)\nW\u02dc , W\u02dc = (w,wr). (15)\nThe coefficient matrix has a double eigenvalue precisely\nwhen \u039b = a\/r. Thus, upon reversing the coordinate\ntransformations that led from Eq. (9) to Eq. (15), we\nsee that the coefficient matrix on the right-hand side of\nEq. (9), also truncated formally at order 1\/r, has a double\neigenvalue precisely when \u03bb is equal to \u03bbbp + a\/r. Since\nthe truncated coefficient matrix, acting on 2pi-periodic\nfunctions in \u03d1, is explicitly given by\nA0(\u03bb) +\n1\nr\nA1(\u03bb) =( \u2212 (\u03ba+ \u03b81r ) \u2202\u03d1 1\nD\u22121 [\u03bb\u2212 \u03c9\u2202\u03d1 \u2212 fu(u0(\u03d1) + u1(\u03d1)\/r)] \u2212\n(\n\u03ba+ \u03b81r\n)\n\u2202\u03d1\n)\n,\nand since we assumed that we know \u03bbbp, we can therefore\ncompute the value of \u03bb for which A0+A1\/r has a double\neigenvalue numerically as a function of 1\/r; from these\nvalues and the expansion \u03bb = \u03bbbp + a\/r, we then obtain\nthe coefficient a.\n5IV. SPECTRA OF NON-SELFADJOINT\nSCHRO\u00a8DINGER EQUATIONS\nWe now discuss the spectrum of (13)-(14). When\n\u03a6 := arg\n(a\nd\n)\n(16)\nsatisfies |\u03a6| < pi\/2, the Schro\u00a8dinger equation (13)-(14)\nhas infinitely many point eigenvalues, given approxi-\nmately by\n\u039bn =\na2\n4dn2\n[\n1 + O\n(\n1\nn\n)]\n, n\u00c0 1, n \u2208 N, (17)\nthat accumulate at the origin along the ray\narg \u039b = \u03a8 = arg\n(\na2\nd\n)\n(18)\n(see Fig. 4(i)). The point eigenvalues depend on the\nboundary conditions (14) only through the higher-order\nterm O(1\/n). In contrast, when |\u03a6| > pi\/2, then (13)-\n(14) does not have any point eigenvalues near the origin.\nAt the transition point \u03a6 = \u00b1pi\/2, the eigenvalues dis-\nappear through the essential spectrum by moving to the\n\u201dwrong\u201d Riemann sheet of the dispersion relation, thus\ncorresponding to resonance poles with exponentially in-\ncreasing eigenfunctions. Before we continue our discus-\nsion, we remark that both cases |\u03a6| < pi\/2 and |\u03a6| > pi\/2\ndo occur, and we refer to \u00a7V below for examples.\nWe now provide arguments to support our claims.\nIf the ratios a\/d and s1\/s2 are real, then (13)\u2013(14) is\nselfadjoint, and [16, Thm. XIII.6(a)] readily shows that\nthe above dichotomy holds true. In the complex non-\nselfadjoint case, consider first the truncated Schro\u00a8dinger\nequation\nwrr +\na\ndr\nw =\n\u03b32\n4\nw,\n\u03b32\n4\n=\n\u039b\nd\n, r \u2208 [R0,\u221e). (19)\nIts unique bounded solution w(r) is the Whittaker func-\ntionWa\/(d\u03b3),1\/2(\u03b3r) which, according to Ref. [17, (4.4.18)\nand (4.4.33)], admits the expansion\nw(R0) = R\n1\/4\n0 cos\n(\u221a\n4aR0\nd\n\u2212 api\n\u03b3d\n+\npi\n4\n)[\n1 + O(|\u03b3|1\/2)\n]\nat r = R0. Substituting w(R0) and its derivative wr(R0)\ninto the boundary condition (14), we see that Eq. (14) is\nmet provided \u03b3 = \u03b3n where \u03b3n = and +O(1\/n\n2) for inte-\ngers n\u00c0 1. Note that the actual values of s1 and s2 enter\nonly at higher order. Reverting back to the variable \u039b,\nwe obtain the asymptotics (17), as claimed. Lastly, using\nvariation-of-parameters and [18, Thm. 11.1 in \u00a76] for the\nrescaled spatial variable s = |\u03b3|r in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0, this\nanalysis can be extended to the full problem (13) pro-\nvided the coefficients in Eq. (13) are analytic in r (the\narguments in Ref. [18] require a holomorphic extension\n\u039b = \u2212d\u03b32\nd\n\u03a6\na\n\u03a6\n\u03a8\n\u03a6 = pi\/8\n\u03a6 = pi\/4\n\u03a6 = 3pi\/8\n(i) (ii)\n 0\n 0.02\n 0.04\n-0.08 -0.04  0  0.04\n         \n \n \nFIG. 4: The complex \u039b-plane is shown: (i) When \u03a6 =\narg(a\/d) satisfies |\u03a6| < pi\n2\n, the Schro\u00a8dinger equation (13) has\ninfinitely many bound states that accumulate on the origin\nalong the ray arg \u039b = \u03a8 = arg(a2\/d).

Point eigenvalues\naccumulate approximately along the ray arg \u039b = 2\u03a6.\nto complex r). We do not currently have mathemat-\nical proofs in the case of non-analytic coefficients, but\nremark that all numerical simulations with non-analytic\ncoefficients that we performed have produced results con-\nsistent with the claimed alignment with arg \u039b = \u03a8.\nHence, the results derived in this section indicate that\nspiral waves will have many point eigenvalues to the right\nof branch points of the linear dispersion relation when-\never the angles \u03a6 and \u03a8 are smaller than pi\/2.\nOne standard criterion for the onset of absolute in-\nstability of spirals is the saddle-point condition derived\nin Refs. [19, 20]. This criterion states that spiral waves\ndestabilize when the wave trains emitted by the spiral\nwaves become absolutely unstable which, in turn, occurs\nwhen a branch point \u03bbbp of their linear dispersion rela-\ntion, given by \u03bbbp = \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd) with d\u03bb\u2217\/d\u03bd(\u03bd) = 0, crosses\nthe imaginary axis. Our results show that point eigen-\nvalues caused by curvature effects may destabilize spirals\nprior to branch points crossing and that the occurrence of\nthese eigenvalues can be predicted from the asymptotic\nprofile of the spiral.\nV. APPLICATIONS\nFirst, we compare the prediction in Eq. (18) with the\nspectral computations by Barkley and Wheeler [13], re-\nproduced in Fig. 3, for the modified FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo\nequation\nut = \u2206u\u2212 1\n\u00b2\nu(u\u2212 1)\n(\nu\u2212 b+ v\na\n)\n, (20)\nvt = f(u)\u2212 v\nwith f(u) as in Ref. [6] and parameters as in Ref. [14,\n(14)-(15)]. Note that our results are applicable to\nEq. (20) even though one of its diffusion coefficients van-\nishes. Indeed, the v-component of the eigenvalue problem\nassociated with a spiral wave (u\u2217, v\u2217) of Eq.

The remaining\nanalysis proceeds then exactly as before.\nThe absolute spectra of the spiral wave of Eq. (20)\nhave been previously computed in Ref. [14] which al-\nlows us to compute d, while the coefficient a can be cal-\nculated as outlined at the end of Section III using the\nboundary-value problem solver auto [21]. Substitution\ninto Eq. (18) gives a prediction for the asymptotic angle\nof the ray, emanating from the branch point, along which\nthe eigenvalues in Fig. 3 to the right of the absolute spec-\ntrum should align themselves. We also estimated this\nangle from Fig. 3 using the branch point at the edge of\nthe absolute spectrum as origin. The resulting values are\nBreakup at: core far field\narg(a\/d) computed with auto 40\u25e6 44\u25e6\narg \u039bn extracted from Ref.

The dotted curve cor-\nresponds to those parameter values for which the first point\neigenvalue of the spiral wave crosses the imaginary axis.\non BR(0) with Neumann boundary conditions. Spiral\nwaves of Eq. (21) satisfy an ODE and can therefore be\ncomputed using auto.\nWe have calculated the curve in (\u03b1, \u03b2)-space along\nwhich the absolute spectrum of the asymptotic wave\ntrains crosses the imaginary axis, leading to an abso-\nlute instability: This curve, further divided into the\nfour curve segments \u03931, . . . ,\u03934 which will be explained\nshortly, is shown in Fig. 5. Our computations show that\nthe absolute spectrum crosses at a branch point for each\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) on one of the curve segments \u03931, \u03932 and \u03933, thus\nconfirming the results in Ref. [20]. However, for (\u03b1, \u03b2)\non the curve segment \u03931, the spiral wave is already un-\nstable due to point eigenvalues which have crossed the\nimaginary axis prior to the branch point: our numeri-\ncal computations show that both \u03a6 from Eq. (16) and\n\u03a8 from Eq. (18) are smaller than pi\/2 for parameters on\n\u03931. We computed the point eigenvalues that arise due to\nour results in \u00a7III and \u00a7IV for (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0.54, 4.2) \u2208 \u03931\nand plotted them in Fig. 6. Along the curve \u03932, the point\neigenvalues are also present but lie to the left of the imag-\ninary axis since the angle \u03a8 from Eq. (18) is larger than\npi\/2. Lastly, along the curve segment \u03933, the angle \u03a6 is\nlarger than pi\/2 so that there are no point eigenvalues\nemerging from the branch point of the linear dispersion\nrelation. Thus, in summary, our results show that the\nstability region for spiral waves in the complex Ginzburg\u2013\nLandau equation is smaller than that predicted by the\nabsolute spectrum (see Fig. 7 for a schematic illustra-\ntion).\nFor completeness, we point out that along the curve\nsegment \u03934 the absolute spectrum crosses the imaginary\naxis away from branch points. In fact, the linear dis-\npersion relation of the spiral does not have any branch\npoints with the correct Morse index, and the criterion\ngiven in Ref. [20] therefore fails to predict the correct\nonset of instability.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe showed that the linearization about spiral waves\nnear branch points can be reduced to a non-selfadjoint\nSchro\u00a8dinger operator with a complex long-range poten-\ntial which accounts for curvature effects and decays al-\ngebraically like 1\/r in the radius r. The spectral prop-\nerties of the Schro\u00a8dinger operator are characterized by\ntwo complex coefficients a and d. Based on this reduc-\n7tion, we have provided theoretical evidence that spiral\nspectra contain isolated point eigenvalues near branch\npoints whenever the angle \u03a6 = arg(a\/d) has modulus\nless than pi\/2. The number of these eigenvalues increases\nas the domain size increases. Furthermore, if the angle\n\u03a8 = arg(a2\/d) has modulus less than pi\/2, then these\npoint eigenvalues destabilize the spiral prior to an abso-\nlute instability. It is worthwhile to mention that branch\npoints of spiral waves are periodic in the imaginary direc-\ntion with period given by the angular velocity \u03c9: eigen-\nvalues will emerge simultaneously from all these period-\nically spaced branch points.\nOur results have the following consequence. A stan-\ndard test for absolute instabilities of spirals is the branch\npoint or saddle-point criterion due to Refs. [19, 20] which\nstates that absolute instabilities of spirals occur whenever\ncertain branch points of their linear dispersion relation\ncross the imaginary axis. As shown in this paper, point\neigenvalues emerging from branch points may destabilize\nspirals prior to branch points crossing. The location of\nthese eigenvalues can be predicted from the angles \u03a6 and\n\u03a8 through the coefficients a and d using only the asymp-\ntotic 1D profile of the spiral. We showed that this insta-\nbility scenario occurs for a modified FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo\nequation and the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation.\nWe thank D. Barkley and P.
