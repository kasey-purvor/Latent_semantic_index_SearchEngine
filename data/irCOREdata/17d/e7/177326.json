We evaluated biomarkers\nfor assessing fruit and vegetable intake and compliance in a 2-year trial. Postmenopausal women were randomised to 300 g additional fruit\nand vegetables per d (n 66), placebo (n 70) or potassium citrate (n 140). They completed dietary checklists (3-monthly) and food diaries\nor FFQ (yearly). We measured whole-blood folate, plasma vitamin C and homocysteine (yearly), serum vitamin E and carotenoids\n(at 12 months) and urinary vitamin K metabolites (yearly). Plasma vitamin C was associated with fruit and vegetable intake at baseline\n(r \u00fe 0\u00b731; P,0\u00b701), remaining significant only for the non-fruit and vegetable group at 12 months (r \u00fe 0\u00b743; P,0\u00b701). For the fruit and vegetable\ngroup, vitamin C increased by 5\u00b79mmol\/l (P\u00bc0\u00b707) but was not significantly associated with fruit and vegetable intake; vitamin E, b-carotene and\nb-cryptoxanthin were higher compared with the non-fruit and vegetable group (P,0\u00b705); and whole-blood folate and the urinary 5C-aglycone\nmetabolite of vitamin K were associated with vegetable intake. For all participants plasma vitamin C increased with increasing fruit and vegetable\nintakes, reaching a plateau of 90\u201395mmol\/l at intakes . 500 g\/d, whereas whole-blood folate, b-carotene and b-cryptoxanthin continued to\nincrease. Concentrations of vitamin C, folate and b-cryptoxanthin were lower and the 7C-aglycone metabolite of vitamin K higher, in smokers\ncompared with non-smokers. Suitable markers for monitoring fruit and vegetable compliance include b-carotene and b-cryptoxanthin. Plasma\nvitamin C and whole-blood folate may be suitable for monitoring intakes in populations but for monitoring compliance the former may be\nrestricted to low intakes of fruit and vegetables and the latter to vegetable intake.\nFruit intake: Vegetable intake: Vitamin biomarkers\nFruit and vegetable intake may play a role in preventing many\nchronic diseases including stroke(1), CVD(2) and certain\ncancers(3). More recently, evidence supporting the protective\neffect of fruit and vegetables against cancer was reported to\nbe less convincing but public health goals of . 600 g\/d for\nnon-starchy vegetables and fruits have been justified using\nan integrated approach to the evidence(4).\nIt is recognised that fruit and vegetable intakes do not meet\ncurrent guidelines(5). The UK National Diet and Nutrition\nSurvey found that overall women were eating fewer than\nthree portions per d and although daily intakes were propor-\ntionally higher for older women, 78 % of 50- to 60-year-old\nwomen were still eating less than five portions per d(6).\nInterventions to increase fruit and vegetable intake have\ngenerally shown modest improvements of about 1\u20131\u00b75\nportions per d(7 \u2013 9), estimated from questionnaires. As food\ndiaries are burdensome, short questionnaires are often\nused(10) but these are still subjective. Biomarkers such as\nlow urinary pH(11) and carotenoids(12) have been used to help\nvalidate fruit and vegetable intakes obtained from question-\nnaires. Few studies have used biomarkers to assess compliance\nof a dietary intervention. Increases in plasma vitamin E (but\nnot vitamin C) were observed 12 months after behavioural\nand nutritional education counselling to increase fruit and\nvegetable intake(13) and some plasma carotenoids and\nplasma vitamin C increased in a 6-month trial of a brief\nnegotiation method aimed at increasing fruit and vegetable\nintakes(8), both studies being carried out in a primary-care\nsetting. As far as we are aware there are no data on longer-\nterm studies.\nIn our randomised controlled trial of free-living postmeno-\npausal women, one of the interventions required extra fruit\nand vegetable consumption (300 g\/d), over 2 years. The results\nof the potassium citrate and fruit and vegetable intervention on\nbone health have been published elsewhere(14). The aim of the\npresent study was (1) to evaluate concentrations of vitamins\n*Corresponding author: Dr Helen Macdonald, fax \u00fe44 1224 559348, email h.macdonald@abdn.ac.uk\nAbbreviations: 5C-aglycone, 2-methyl-3-(30-30-carboxymethylpropyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone; 7C-aglycone, 2-methyl-3-(50-carboxy-30-methyl-20-pentenyl)-1,4-\nnaphthoquinone; IQR, interquartile range.\nBritish Journal of Nutrition (2009), 102, 1477\u20131486 doi:10.1017\/S0007114509990377\nq The Authors 2009\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\n(E, C, K), carotenoids, folate and homocysteine in blood and\nurine as biomarkers for assessing overall fruit and vegetable\nintakes and to assess compliance in the fruit and vegetable\nintervention group and (2) to compare the relationship\nbetween these biomarkers and fruit and vegetable intake\nin those who were asked to increase their intake of fruit and\nvegetables with those who were not.\nMethods\nStudy subjects\nEthical permission was obtained from Grampian Research\nEthics Committee (no. 02\/0053) and the study registered\nwith the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial\nNumber Register (no. ISRCTN86186352). Study participants\ntook part in a randomised placebo-controlled trial in which\n276 women were randomised as follows: 140 women to one\nof two doses of potassium citrate treatment (18\u00b75 mEq\/d or\n55\u00b76 mEq\/d), seventy women to placebo, and sixty-six\nwomen were assigned to the fruit and vegetable intervention\narm(14). Women were excluded if they suffered from severe\ndisease, malabsorption, were taking medications that affected\nbone metabolism, or were currently taking K-sparing diuretics.\nIn total 226 women completed the 2-year trial (Fig. 1).\nAll women completed a food diary before the baseline visit.\nFor the fruit and vegetable arm, a nutritionist recommended a\ndaily intake of fruit and vegetables specifically for each indi-\nvidual, based on their current intake estimated from the food\ndiary plus an additional 300 g. The other groups were asked\nnot to change their diet. At the baseline visit, the research\nnurse explained what total quantity of fruit and vegetables\neach volunteer had to eat each day; she provided health\npromotion leaflets on how to increase fruit and vegetables in\nthe diet, explained portion sizes, using a range of colour\nphotographs(15) and clarified that fruit juice and pulses could\neach be counted as a maximum of one portion per d. This\nwas repeated at each 3-month visit with discussions on how\nthe volunteers were managing and what was helpful to meet\ntheir target intakes. A small financial contribution (\u00a31 per d)\nwas given to help with the expense of purchasing additional\nfruit and vegetables, and the women were asked to bring in\ntheir shopping receipts at each visit to aid compliance.\nDietary intake assessments\nAll women in the study underwent regular dietary assess-\nments. A 4 d food diary was completed before the baseline\nvisit and at the 1-year visit only. The European Prospective\nInvestigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) food diary\nthat was used included photographs for portion size\nestimation(16) and nutrient analysis was carried out using the\nWindiets dietary analysis program (version 2003; Robert\nGordon University, Aberdeen, UK). A FFQ was completed\nat 21 months(17). Total fruit intake was defined as all fruit\nincluding tinned and dried fruit (nuts were excluded) and\nvegetables did not include potatoes.\nA 3 d dietary checklist was also completed before each\n3-month visit. This consisted of a single page with a list of\nfruits, vegetables and other foods, and spaces for the volunteer\nto mark every time that food had been eaten during the 3 d.\nThe research nurse collected information on portion size\nat baseline and 3 months and from 6 months onwards\nthe women were asked if their portion sizes had changed. If\ninformation was unavailable then standard portion sizes\nwere used(18).\nAnthropometric assessments\nThe women were weighed every 6 months on a set of balance\nscales (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) and height was measured at\nbaseline and 2-year visits using a stadiometer (Holtain Ltd,\nCrymych, Dyfed, UK). An estimate of physical activity\nlevel was obtained using the same questions as used for the\nScottish Heart Health Study(19).\nBlood biomarker measurements\nBlood samples for whole-blood folate, plasma homocysteine\nand plasma vitamin C were collected at baseline, 12 months\nand 24 months as described previously(14). Analysis of these\nsamples was carried out at the Rowett Research Institute\n(Aberdeen, UK). Due to time constraints, the baseline and\n12-month samples for each subject were analysed together,\nand the 24-month samples were analysed in a batch at the\nend of the study. Vitamin E, retinol and the carotenoids\nwere measured in the placebo and fruit and vegetable arms\nat 12 months only. Vitamin C (plasma), vitamin E (a- and\nb-tocopherol), retinol and several carotenoids (a-carotene,\nb-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein\/zeaxanthin)\n(serum) were determined by HPLC under the auspices of the\nUS National Institute of Standards Quality Assurance Program\nas described in detail by Duthie(20). Total plasma homo-\ncysteine was measured by reverse-phase HPLC using the\nDC30 Hcy Homocysteine Assay Kit in combination with\nFig. 1.

Whole-blood folate was measured by RIA\n(Simultrac Radioassay Kit; MP Biomedical, London, UK),\nand expressed per g Hb which was measured in the same\nsample using the Total Haemoglobin Kit (Sigma Diagnostics,\nPoole, Dorset, UK), with appropriate internal standards.\nWithin-assay variation was 3\u00b73 % for total plasma homo-\ncysteine and 4\u00b74 % for whole-blood folate.\nUrinary markers for vitamin K\nIn a subset of women, 24 h urine was collected at each\nvisit, which was used for vitamin K assessment at\nbaseline (n 66) and 12 months (n 56). Two urinary vitamin K\nmetabolites, 2-methyl-3-(50-carboxy-30-methyl-20-pentenyl)-1,\n4-naphthoquinone (7C-aglycone) and 2-methyl-3-(30-30-carboxy-\nmethylpropyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (5C-aglycone), were\nmeasured in the 24 h urine samples (previously stored at\n2808C) by HPLC(21).\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS for Windows (version 15; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)\nwas used for analysing the data. Independent t tests were used\nto detect differences in blood and urinary biomarkers between\nthe combined non-fruit and vegetable group and the fruit and\nvegetable arm. For the serum tocopherols and carotenoids, the\ndifferences tested were between the placebo and fruit and\nvegetable arm. Repeated-measures ANOVA were used to test\nchanges in biomarkers from baseline. Pearson correlations\nwere used to test for significant associations between biomarkers\nat baseline and 12 months with intake of fruit and vegetables\n(estimated from food diaries completed at baseline and\n12 months), and for biomarkers at 24 months with intake at\n21 months (assessed by FFQ). For all women in the study\n(n 231 at 12 months), subjects were categorised into four\ngroups according to their fruit and vegetable intakes (,250 g\/d,\n250\u2013500 g\/d, 500\u2013750 g\/d, .750 g\/d) and differences in\nbiomarkers according to category of fruit and vegetable intake\nwere analysed by one-way ANOVA with analysis of covariance\nto adjust for smoking. P,0\u00b705 was considered significant.\nResults\nThe characteristics of the participants in the fruit and\nvegetable, and combined non-fruit and vegetable groups are\nshown in Table 1. The women in each group had similar\ndietary intakes at baseline but the fruit and vegetable group\nwas heavier (P\u00bc0\u00b705) and had increased intakes of dietary\nPUFA (P\u00bc0\u00b702). There were no differences in baseline\nplasma vitamin C and whole-blood folate but plasma homo-\ncysteine was higher in the fruit and vegetable group (P\u00bc0\u00b702).\nFruit and vegetable intakes\nFor the fruit and vegetable group, estimates of fruit and\nvegetable intakes by dietary checklists were significantly\nhigher from 3 months onwards compared with the baseline\nvisit whereas there was no change for the non-fruit and\nvegetable group (Fig. 2). The magnitude of the increase\nwas much greater for fruit compared with vegetables (at\n12 months the median increase for fruit was 228 (interquartile\nTable 1.

Plasma vitamin C increased incrementally from\nbaseline to the 24-month visit for the non-fruit and vegetable\ngroup (P\u00bc0\u00b706 for 24-month comparison with baseline) and\nfor the fruit and vegetable group plasma vitamin C had\nincreased at 12 months (P\u00bc0\u00b707) with no further increase.\nDietary intakes of folate estimated from food diaries showed\nan increase at 1 year of 33mg per d for the fruit and vegetable\ngroup and a decrease of 16mg per d in the placebo group.\nFor whole-blood folate, expressed relative to Hb, the\nincremental increase seen in both groups from baseline to\n24 months was not significantly different (P\u00bc0\u00b7004 for\nthe non-fruit and vegetable group; P\u00bc0\u00b7085 for the fruit and\nvegetable group; repeated-measures ANOVA). Similar trends\nwere seen if the folate was expressed as ng\/ml lysate (data\nnot shown). For the fruit and vegetable group, plasma homo-\ncysteine had decreased from 11\u00b78 (SD 4\u00b75) to 11\u00b74 (SD 4\u00b77)\nmmol\/l at 12 months and 10\u00b78 (SD 3\u00b79) mmol\/l at 24 months\n(P\u00bc0\u00b7014; n 60; repeated-measures ANOVA). Plasma homo-\ncysteine for the non-fruit and vegetable group was 10\u00b75 (SD 3\u00b73)\nmmol\/l at baseline, 10\u00b74 (SD 3\u00b71) mmol\/l at 12 months and\n10\u00b70 (SD 2\u00b79) mmol\/l at 24 months (P\u00bc0\u00b7001; n 163; repeated-\nmeasures ANOVA). Again, there was little difference in the\nmagnitude of the change between the two groups.\nPlasma vitamin C was positively correlated with intakes of\nfruit, fruit and vegetables, and dietary vitamin C (estimated\nfrom diaries or FFQ) throughout the study for the non-fruit\nand vegetable group but only at baseline for the fruit and\nvegetable intervention group (Table 2). For whole-blood\nfolate, there was a significant association with fruit and\nvegetable intake for both groups at 12 months (Table 2).\nThere were no significant associations between plasma homo-\ncysteine and fruit and vegetable intakes. The findings did not\nchange after adjusting for smoking status (current smoker\/non-\nsmoker). There was a negative correlation between whole-\nblood folate and plasma homocysteine, which was significant\n(P,0\u00b7001 for all visits) for the complete study population\n(Pearson\u2019s correlations for the log-transformed variables\nwere r 20\u00b740 at baseline, r 20\u00b736 at 1 year and r 20\u00b737 at\n2 years). The results were similar when tested for the fruit\nand vegetable group only (complete data not shown).\nAdditional post-study biomarker measurements and\ncomparison with other biomarkers\nAt 12 months, concentrations of b-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin,\na-tocopherol and g-tocopherol, expressed per mmol choles-\nterol, were significantly greater in the fruit and vegetable inter-\nvention group compared with the placebo group (Table 3). In\ncomparison, differences in plasma vitamin C, whole-blood\nfolate, plasma homocysteine and urinary K were not statisti-\ncally significant between the two groups at 12 months.\nMean urinary vitamin K metabolites varied markedly\nbetween the treatment groups at baseline, with the placebo\ngroup having significantly lower mean urinary vitamin K\ncompared with the fruit and vegetable group. At 12 months\nthe difference between the treatment groups was not signifi-\ncant. At baseline there was no association between urinary\nvitamin K metabolites and fruit and vegetable intake\n(Table 4). At 12 months there was a positive correlation\nbetween the 5C-aglycone urinary marker and vegetable\nintake (r 0\u00b727; P\u00bc0\u00b7047) but not with fruit intake, and\ndietary intake of vitamin K1 estimated from food diaries\ncorrelated with the 5C-aglycone urinary marker (r 0\u00b730;\nP\u00bc0\u00b7026). The association between vegetable intake, dietary\nvitamin K1 and the 7C-aglycone marker was not significant\n(complete data not shown).\nFig. 2.

There was a small but significant increase in vegetable\nintake (P,0\u00b701 for all visits except for 15 months where P\u00bc0\u00b704). At 12\nmonths the median increase for fruit was 228 (interquartile range (IQR) 59\u2013\n389) g\/d and for vegetables 67 (IQR 224 to 154) g\/d. For the non-FV group,\ncompared with baseline intakes there was no significant change in intakes of\neither fruit or vegetables. At 12 months fruit intake decreased by 25 (IQR\n2189 to 107) g\/d, and vegetable intake increased by 17 (IQR 250 to 91)\ng\/d; neither change was significant.\nH. M.

Plasma\nvitamin C increased with increasing category of fruit and\nvegetables up to 500 g\/d but with no further increase for\nintakes above 500 g\/d. Whole-blood folate mean values were\nsimilar for categories of , 250 g\/d and up to 500 g\/d\nfruit and vegetable intake, then increased from 500 g\/d to\n500\u2013750 g\/d and .750 g\/d (Table 6). There was no relation-\nship between serum tocopherol and category of fruit and\nvegetable intake, although when expressed relative to serum\ncholesterol there was a significant increase in a-tocopherol.\nThe carotenoids b-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin and a-carotene\nalso increased progressively with category of fruit and\nvegetable intake. A similar trend for the urinary vitamin K\nmetabolites (measured in fifty-five women) was not statisti-\ncally significant.\nSmoking\nNon-smokers had significantly higher circulating plasma\nvitamin C, whole-blood folate and serum b-cryptoxanthin\ncompared with smokers. Urinary vitamin K metabolites were\nlower in the non-smokers and there was no difference in\nserum concentrations of a- and g-tocopherol between smokers\nand non-smokers (Table 6). Although the numbers in the 24 h\nurine subset were small, the result was statistically significant\nfor the 7C-aglycone vitamin K metabolite. Fruit and vegetable\nintakes were significantly lower for the smokers but the sig-\nnificant differences in the biomarker results remained signifi-\ncant after adjustment for total fruit and vegetable intake.\nDiscussion\nFruit and vegetable intakes\nFood diaries and checklists suggested good compliance with\nthe dietary intervention but the blood measurements did not\ncorroborate this. We cannot be certain that the discrepancies\nbetween biomarkers and reported fruit and vegetable intakes\nare not due to non-compliance. Interestingly, the placebo\ngroup, who did not report increased intake of fruit and\nvegetables, showed small increases in plasma vitamin C\nand whole-blood folate during the study. The women were\nregularly asked about the portion sizes of different fruits and\nvegetables they were eating and this, together with public\nhealth campaigns with government advice and supermarket\npromotions to eat \u20185-a-day\u2019, may have made them more\naware of fruit and vegetables in general, leading them to\ninadvertently increase the amount of fruits and vegetables\nthey were eating.\nPlasma vitamin C, folate and homocysteine\nWe observed a significant association between fruit and\nvegetable intake and plasma vitamin C at all visits for theT\na\nb\nle\n2\n.\nP\ne\na\nrs\no\nn\nc\no\nrr\ne\nla\nti\no\nn\ns\n(r\n)\nb\ne\ntw\ne\ne\nn\nb\nlo\no\nd\nm\ne\na\ns\nu\nre\nm\ne\nn\nts\n(p\nla\ns\nm\na\nv\nit\na\nm\nin\nC\n,\nw\nh\no\nle\n-b\nlo\no\nd\nfo\nla\nte\na\nn\nd\np\nla\ns\nm\na\nh\no\nm\no\nc\ny\ns\nte\nin\ne\n)\na\nn\nd\nd\na\nily\nin\nta\nk\ne\ns\no\nf\nfr\nu\nit\n,\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\na\nn\nd\nv\nit\na\nm\nin\ns\ne\ns\nti\nm\na\nte\nd\nfr\no\nm\nfo\no\nd\nd\nia\nri\ne\ns\n(b\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\na\nn\nd\n1\n2\nm\no\nn\nth\ns\n)\no\nr\nF\nF\nQ\n(2\n1\nm\no\nn\nth\ns\n)\u2021\nP\nla\ns\nm\na\nv\nit\na\nm\nin\nC\n(m\nm\no\nl\/\nl)\na\nn\nd\nd\na\nily\nd\nie\nta\nry\nin\nta\nk\ne\ns\no\nf\nW\nh\no\nle\n-b\nlo\no\nd\nfo\nla\nte\n(n\ng\n\/g\nH\nb\n)\na\nn\nd\nd\na\nily\nd\nie\nta\nry\nin\nta\nk\ne\ns\no\nf\nP\nla\ns\nm\na\nh\no\nm\no\nc\ny\ns\nte\nin\ne\n(m\nm\no\nl\/\nl)\na\nn\nd\nd\na\nily\nd\nie\nta\nry\nin\nta\nk\ne\ns\no\nf\nG\nro\nu\np\nn\nF\nru\nit\n(g\n)\nV\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n(g\n)\nF\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n(g\n)\nV\nit\na\nm\nin\nC\n(m\ng\n)\nn\nF\nru\nit\n(g\n)\nV\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n(g\n)\nF\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n(g\n)\nF\no\nla\nte\n(m\ng\n)\nn\nF\nru\nit\n(g\n)\nV\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n(g\n)\nF\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n(g\n)\nF\no\nla\nte\n(m\ng\n)\nB\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\nv\nis\nit\na\nn\nd\nb\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\nd\nia\nry\nN\no\nn\n-f\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n2\n0\n8\n0\n\u00b72\n7\n*\n0\n\u00b71\n6\n*\n0\n\u00b72\n9\n**\n0\n\u00b72\n6\n**\n2\n0\n7\n0\n\u00b71\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n1\n0\n\u00b71\n4\n\u2020\n0\n\u00b73\n0\n**\n2\n0\n8\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n4\n*\n2\n0\n\u00b70\n1\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n2\n\u2020\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n9\n**\nF\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n6\n5\n0\n\u00b72\n9\n*\n0\n\u00b72\n2\n\u2020\n0\n\u00b73\n1\n*\n0\n\u00b73\n4\n**\n6\n6\n0\n\u00b70\n9\n0\n\u00b70\n9\n0\n\u00b71\n0\n0\n\u00b73\n7\n**\n6\n6\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n2\n\u2020\n2\n0\n\u00b70\n6\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n0\n2\n0\n\u00b73\n3\n**\nY\ne\na\nr\n1\nv\nis\nit\na\nn\nd\n1\n2\n-m\no\nn\nth\nd\nia\nry\nN\no\nn\n-f\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n1\n6\n6\n0\n\u00b73\n8\n**\n0\n\u00b72\n8\n**\n0\n\u00b74\n3\n**\n0\n\u00b73\n9\n**\n1\n6\n7\n0\n\u00b73\n3\n**\n0\n\u00b71\n7\n*\n0\n\u00b73\n4\n**\n0\n\u00b73\n0\n**\n1\n6\n6\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n0\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n5\n\u2020\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n5\n\u2020\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n0\n*\nF\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n6\n3\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n7\n0\n\u00b71\n2\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n0\n0\n\u00b70\n3\n6\n3\n0\n\u00b72\n3\n\u2020\n0\n\u00b72\n6\n*\n0\n\u00b73\n7\n0\n\u00b73\n7\n**\n6\n3\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n3\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n0\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n8\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n4\n\u2020\nY\ne\na\nr\n2\nv\nis\nit\na\nn\nd\n2\n1\n-m\no\nn\nth\nF\nF\nQ\nN\no\nn\n-f\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n1\n6\n0\n0\n\u00b73\n0\n**\n0\n\u00b72\n8\n**\n0\n\u00b73\n4\n**\n0\n\u00b73\n5\n**\n1\n6\n0\n0\n\u00b71\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n8\n*\n0\n\u00b71\n6\n*\n0\n\u00b71\n7\n*\n1\n5\n8\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n0\n2\n0\n\u00b70\n4\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n0\n2\n0\n\u00b70\n4\nF\nru\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\ns\n5\n6\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n6\n\u2020\n2\n0\n\u00b70\n6\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n6\n\u2020\n2\n0\n\u00b72\n6\n\u2020\n6\n0\n0\n\u00b70\n2\n0\n\u00b70\n5\n0\n\u00b70\n3\n0\n\u00b70\n5\n6\n0\n0\n\u00b70\n4\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n0\n0\n\u00b70\n1\n2\n0\n\u00b71\n0\n*\nP\n,\n0\n\u00b70\n5\n,\n**\nP\n,\n0\n\u00b70\n1\n,\n\u2020\nP\n,\n0\n\u00b70\n8\n.\n\u2021\nV\na\nri\na\nb\nle\ns\nw\ne\nre\nlo\ng\ntr\na\nn\ns\nfo\nrm\ne\nd\nif\nn\no\nt\nn\no\nrm\na\nlly\nd\nis\ntr\nib\nu\nte\nd\n.\nA\nd\nju\ns\ntm\ne\nn\nt\nfo\nr\ns\nm\no\nk\nin\ng\nd\nid\nn\no\nt\nc\nh\na\nn\ng\ne\nth\ne\na\ns\ns\no\nci\na\nti\no\nn\ns\nb\ne\ntw\ne\ne\nn\nfr\nu\nit\na\nn\nd\nv\ne\ng\ne\nta\nb\nle\nin\nta\nk\ne\na\nn\nd\nb\nio\nm\na\nrk\ne\nrs\n.\nBiomarkers for fruit and vegetable intake 1481\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\ncombined non-fruit and vegetable groups but not during the\nintervention for the fruit and vegetable group. The mean\nplasma vitamin C of 82\u201384mmol\/l may have been optimal\nat the start of the study(22).

At 6 months their daily fruit\nand vegetable consumption (estimated by questionnaire) had\nincreased by 1\u00b74 portions and plasma vitamin C by 1mmol\/l.\nIn the present study, a reported increase of three portions\nper d resulted in a non-significant increase in plasma vitamin\nC of 5\u00b79mmol\/l at 12 months. A study of 105 men and 166\nwomen (mean age 40 and 48 years, respectively) showed\nthat plasma vitamin C was 68\u00b72mmol\/l for intakes of , 2\u00b75\nportions, 81\u00b73mmol\/l for intakes of 3\u20134\u00b75 portions, decreasing\nslightly to 78\u00b72mmol\/l for intakes . five portions per d(23).\nAssuming a portion size of 100 g, our data are comparable\nwith a mean plasma vitamin C of 63mmol\/l for , 2\u00b75 and\n80mmol\/l for up to five portions per d.

This plateau effect suggests\nthat plasma vitamin C may be useful for monitoring when\nintakes of fruit and vegetables are low to moderate but it is\nnot an ideal marker at high intakes.

Not all fruits and vegetables\ncontain large amounts of folate and other foods contain\nfolate, including fortified foods. Plasma homocysteine\ncan be reduced by other B vitamins (vitamin B6, B12 and\nriboflavin) in addition to dietary folate obtained from fruit\nand vegetable consumption(25). Plasma homocysteine concen-\ntrations decreased similarly for all treatment groups and the\neffect was not limited to the fruit and vegetable group. This\nmay be due to increased dietary folic acid in the food chain,\ndue to an increasing number of fortified foods (for example,\nbreakfast cereals). In spite of this confounding there was\na consistent association between whole-blood folate and\nfruit and vegetable intake, in particular vegetable intake.\nA 4-week intervention of seventy-one women in the\nNetherlands, half of whom were instructed to eat 200 g\nvegetables and two portions of fruit and whose reported\nincrease was 133 g for fruit and 64 g for vegetables, with an\nincrease in daily folate intake of 33mg, showed no effect on\nhomocysteine or plasma folate(26). The authors concluded\nthat the duration of the intervention was probably too short\nto have an effect. In a more controlled 4-week intervention\ninvolving sixty-six subjects of whom twenty-two were given\nfolate-rich vegetables and citrus fruit (estimated to provide\nan additional 350mg folate per d), erythrocyte folate was\nTable 5.

Since the small increase we observed in whole-\nblood folate in the present study was not restricted to the fruit\nand vegetable group, and mean homocysteine decreased over-\nall, it is likely that fortified foods such as breakfast cereals\n(which are not often updated in the database) may be influen-\ncing dietary folate.\nSerum tocopherols and carotenoids\nWe observed a significant difference in some carotenoids\nbetween the placebo and fruit and vegetable groups at\n12 months, and a linear association across categories of fruit\nand vegetable intakes to . 750 g\/d, suggesting that caroten-\noids, in particular b-cryptoxanthin, could be useful as\nbiomarkers across a wide range of intakes. Compared with\nthe elderly Framingham women (aged 67\u201393 years), the\nwomen in the fruit and vegetable intervention group\nof the present study at 12 months had slightly higher\ncirculating concentrations of a-carotene (0\u00b7143 compared\nwith 0\u00b7117mmol\/l) and the circulating concentrations of\nb-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene and lutein\/zeaxanthin\nwere similar or marginally lower. In the Framingham\nwomen, 9 % were taking b-carotene supplements and they\nwere eating five servings of fruit and vegetables per d(28).\nWe had no b-carotene supplement use in our population\nbut portions of fruit and vegetables were similar or higher.\nThe discrepancy with a-tocopherol being higher in the fruit\nand vegetable group but not being significantly associated\nwith overall fruit and vegetable intake may be due to the\nfruit and vegetable group having marginally higher intakes\nof fat (i.e. polyunsaturated fats or oils containing vitamin E).\nUrinary markers\nAlthough we did not observe an association between urinary\nvitamin K metabolites and vegetable intake, this may be\nbecause the number of subjects that provided 24 h urine\nwas small and the reported increase in vegetables in the pre-\nsent study was also small. These markers may prove useful\nfor assessing compliance in larger studies involving green\nvegetables. Similarly, small sample size may partly explain\nwhy K was not significantly higher in the fruit and vegetable\ngroup compared with the placebo group. Dietary K is found\nin other foods, including milk, making it an inappropriate\nmarker for estimating fruit and vegetable intake in popu-\nlation studies.\nSmoking, weight and energy intake\nEnergy intake increased with increasing category of fruit and\nvegetable intake whereas numbers of smokers decreased.\nBody weight peaked in the 500\u2013750 g\/d fruit and vegetable\ncategory.

When adjustment was made for smoking it did\nnot alter the relationship between fruit and vegetable category\nand biomarkers but the association with body weight was no\nlonger significant.\nBiomarker levels in smokers\nPlasma vitamin C and carotenoid concentrations have been\nreported to be lower in male Scottish smokers compared with\nnon-smokers(29). In the present study of women, although\nsmokers had lower fruit and vegetable intakes this did not\naccount completely for the differences in biomarkers between\nsmokers and non-smokers. As smoking increases the catabolism\nof vitamin C, higher intakes of vitamin C are required to main-\ntain similar levels to those seen in non-smokers, which may\nexplain the differences. The same may apply to the carotenoids.\nFor b-cryptoxanthin there was a two-fold difference between\nsmokers and non-smokers and most of the other carotenoids\nwere lower in smokers, although not statistically significant.\nLycopene, retinol and the vitamin E homologues, a-tocopherol\nand g-tocopherol, were almost identical. Urinary vitamin K\nmetabolites were higher in the smokers. It is possible that the\nhigher concentrations of vitamin K reflect a diet that is higher\nin fat in smokers. In a study of Scottish men, serum vitamin\nK was not found to be significantly different between smokers\nand non-smokers(30). The differences in urinary metabolites\nseen in the present study may reflect altered vitamin K\nmetabolism in smokers but a larger study is required to confirm\nthe observation. Other studies have reported higher vitamin E\nlevels in smokers compared with non-smokers(23,31). Yet diet-\nary intakes of vitamin E (and vitamin C, total fibre, b-carotene\nand polyunsaturated:saturated fat ratio) were lowest in current\nsmokers and highest in non-smokers(32). Similarly smokers\nwere found to have lower intakes of the antioxidant vitamins\nand fibre, but higher intakes of dietary cholesterol and alcohol\nthan non-smokers(33). There are suggestions that cholesterol\nmetabolism may be altered in smokers(34). The differences\nthat we observed in plasma vitamin C concentrations between\nsmokers and non-smokers were almost identical to results of a\nstudy where a third were smokers compared with 15 % in the\npresent study(23).\nStrengths and limitations\nA limitation of the present study is that a pragmatic approach\nto the fruit and vegetable intervention was used whereby the\nnumber of portions per d was specified but not the actual\ntype of fruit and vegetables to be eaten; and overall diet was\nnot controlled. For the sub-studies we did not have baseline\nmeasurements for carotenoids and only a limited number of\n24 h urine measurements for the vitamin K metabolites.\nIts findings are restricted to healthy postmenopausal women.\nA major strength is the study duration of 2 years with free-\nliving participants being seen every 3 months and a range of\nbiomarkers were tested.\nConclusion\nPlasma homocysteine was not found to be a suitable marker of\nfruit and vegetable intake. Plasma vitamin C and whole-blood\nfolate were associated with intakes of fruit, vegetables and\ntotal fruit and vegetables in our study population for the\nnon-fruit and vegetable intervention group. Neither marker\nwas suitable for assessing changes in fruit and vegetable\nintake, during the intervention, nor for assessing differences\nin intake between the fruit and vegetable and placebo\ngroups. In contrast, although our data are limited, b-carotene\nand b-cryptoxanthin appear to be superior for assessing differ-\nences between the treatment groups. For the urinary vitamin K\nmetabolites, these data are the first to be published in a\nUK population but further work is required to assess their\nusefulness as markers of fruit and vegetable intake.\nIn summary, the use of different biomarkers may be useful\nfor monitoring fruit and vegetable intakes in populations. For\nmonitoring enforced change in diet, however, their use may be\nrestricted to a narrow range of fruit and vegetable intake,\nwhich will depend on the specific biomarker used, the type\nof fruit and vegetable being studied and the population\nunder investigation.\nAcknowledgements\nThe present study was funded by the Food Standards Agency\n(N05043).
