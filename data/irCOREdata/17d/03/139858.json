The \neffects of bath composition and pH were studied and compared with results for electrodeposited \ncadmium and zinc-10%nickel.

Baking cadmium \nplated steel for 24 hours at 200\u00b0C gave full recovery of mechanical properties but specimens plated \nwith zinc-1%cobalt and then baked still failed in 89% of the time of unplated controls.  It was shown \nthat hydrogen uptake and embrittlement could be controlled by depositing thin layers of cobalt or \nnickel at the steel\/coating interface.  For example, the least embrittlement was caused by zinc-\n10%nickel (EI 0.037) due to a nickel rich layer with very low hydrogen diffusion coefficient that \nformed during the initial stages of electroplating.  Similarly, a 0.5 micron nickel layer was effective in \nlowering the embrittlement caused by zinc-1%cobalt to that of zinc-10%nickel.  Furthermore, a 0.5 \nmicron cobalt layer deposited before a zinc-1%cobalt coating gave virtually 100% recovery of \nmechanical properties after baking. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nElectrodeposited zinc-cobalt alloys are possible alternatives to cadmium for sacrificial \ncorrosion protection of steel components.  The coatings contain typically 1-4% Co by weight \nand are produced by an anomalous co-deposition mechanism (1,2) that promotes a zinc-rich \nalloy by suppressing the reduction of the more noble cobalt.  The corrosion rate of \nelectrodeposited zinc-4%Co is reported to be very similar to that of the more expensive zinc-\n14%Ni (3). \n \nThe possibility of hydrogen embrittlement is an important consideration when high strength \nsteels are electroplated.  Plating processes generally have a current efficiency of less than \n100% and a proportion of the current passed during electrodeposition results in the generation \nof hydrogen, some of which becomes incorporated in the deposit and subsequently diffuses \ninto the substrate.  When hydrogen embrittlement is thought to be a risk a de-embrittlement \ntreatment may be required.  Following cadmium plating, for example, steels with a tensile \nstrength over 1800 MPa are baked for 24 hours at a temperature in the range 190-230\u00b0C (4). \n \nThe aim of the work described in this paper was to investigate the extent to which \nelectroplating with zinc-cobalt alloys causes hydrogen embrittlement of high strength steel. \nSlow strain rate tests were carried out on plated tensile specimens to measure the effect of the \nabsorbed hydrogen on the loss of the steel\u2019s mechanical properties and the effectiveness of \npost-plating baking treatments in restoring these properties.  For comparison, further tests \nwere conducted on specimens plated with pure zinc, Zn-10%Ni and cadmium and also with \nZn-12%Co-9%Fe to investigate ways in which hydrogen uptake could be controlled by the \ncoating composition. \n 2\n \n \nMETHODS \n \nMaterials  \nThe high strength steel AISI 4340 was selected for the slow strain rate tests due to its known \nsusceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement in the quenched and tempered condition.  The \ncomposition of the material is shown in Table 1. \n \n \nTable 1   Composition of AISI 4340 Steel \n \n%C %Mn %Si %Cr %Ni %Mo %Al %Cu %S %P \n0.41 0.79 0.23 0.88 1.67 0.22 0.024 0.13 0.003 0.009 \n \n \nZinc-Cobalt Electroplating \nZinc-cobalt electrodeposits were produced from an acid sulphate bath of composition (2) \nshown in Table 2.  The electrolyte contained 8% Co and was similar to that used \ncommercially, except that no brighteners were added.  A small quantity of the surfactant \nTeepol was included to avoid the formation of hydrogen bubbles that could lead to defects in \nthe coating. \n  \n \nTable 2   Composition of the zinc-cobalt plating bath \n \nAddition Concentration  (mol dm-3) \n             ZnSO4  7H2O                       1.739 \n             CoSO4  7H20                       0.17 \n             NaSO4                       0.352 \n             CH3COONa                       0.11 \n             Teepol                       0.001 \n \n \nThe standard bath condition, which was used for the majority of the experiments, was a pH of \n4.2 and a temperature of 50\u00b0C.  The resulting coatings were even and shiny, with a maximum \ncobalt content of 1%.  Plating for 15 minutes at a current density of 10 mAcm-2 gave an \naverage coating thickness of 8 \u00b5m, which is generally specified for threaded components. \n \nThe cadmium plating was carried out by a commercial electroplater and the coatings of pure \nzinc, zinc-10%nickel and zinc-12%cobalt-9%iron were plated in the laboratory from the \nelectrolytes shown in Table 3. \n \n 3\nTable 3   Compositions of the other plating solutions \n \nCoating Current Time pH Temp Electrolyte Concentration \n (mAcm-2) (mins)  (\u00b0C)  (mol dm-3) \n  100% Zn \n \n10 15 1 50 ZnSO4.7H2O \nH2SO4 \n      1.2 \n      0.6 \n  92-89% Zn \n  8-11% Ni \n20 15 5 25 ZnSO4.7H2O \nNiSO4.7H2O \n      0.92 \n      0.08 \n  79% Zn \n  12% Co \n  9% Fe \n30 10 3 43 ZnSO4.7H2O \nCoSO4.7H2O \nFeSO4.7H2O \nNa2SO4.7H2O \nCH3COONa.3H2O \nH2SO4 \n      0.4 \n      0.4 \n      0.06 \n      2.5 \n      0.3 \n      0.5 \n \nHydrogen Embrittlement Tests \nTensile specimens for slow strain rate embrittlement testing were machined by CNC turning \nfrom normalised 6mm diameter rod to give a 25mm gauge length of 2.25mm diameter.  They \nwere then hardened by heating in a neutral salt bath at 835\u2013840\u00b0C for 15 minutes, followed \nby an oil quench at room temperature.  Tempering was carried out at 250\u00b0C for 2 hours to \ngive a mean hardness of 528 HV10 and a mean tensile strength of 1850 MNm-2.  The \ntempering temperature of 250\u00b0C was chosen to avoid further change in mechanical properties \nwhen the specimens were later de-embrittled by baking for 24 hours at 200\u00b0C. \n \nThe specimens were prepared for plating by abrading with silicon carbide paper, followed by \ndegreasing in isopropanol.  Pickling and anodic or caustic cleaning were not used to avoid \nhydrogen uptake.  The slow strain rate tests were started immediately after plating, except for \nthose specimens commercially plated with cadmium, which were stored in liquid nitrogen to \nprevent loss of absorbed hydrogen until they could be tested. \n \nThe specimens were tested on a Cortest slow strain rate machine at a strain rate of 1.1 x 10-6 \ns-1 and the times to failure were recorded.  In all, twenty-five specimens were tested in the \nunplated condition to act as controls.  The extent of the embrittlement caused by each plating \ntreatment was assessed by carrying out slow strain rate tests on five or more specimens in the \nas-plated condition.  Additionally, the effectiveness of thermal de-embrittlement was \nmeasured by testing further specimens after first plating and then baking for 24 hours at \n200\u00b0C. \n \n \nRESULTS \n \nHydrogen embrittlement tests often display a range of times to failure when carried out under \napparently identical experimental conditions.  This is due to the variation in the number, size \nand distribution of microstructural flaws within the material at which hydrogen accumulates \nand leads to fracture.  In this work Weibull statistics was used to distinguish between the \neffects of each of the experimental variables. \n \n 4\nWeibull Model of Failure Times \nIt can be shown that for a Weibull model the probability, Ps, of a specimen not failing within \ntime, t, is given by;- \n \nPs  =  1  -  Pt  =  e  -xt                       [1] \n \nWhere Pt is the probability of failure and x is a shape parameter termed the Weibull slope (5-7).  \nIn the present context x represents the probability per unit time that during time, t, a crack \nwill form in the specimen of sufficient size to cause failure.  The value of x can be obtained \nfrom the negative gradient of a graph of ln Ps against t.  A schematic Weibull plot of failure \ntimes is shown in Fig 1.  The graph is displaced along the time axis by the amount ti, known \nas the minimum crack incubation time.  (When Ps = 1, then ln Ps = 0 and t = ti ). \n \nEquation [3] can be modified to include ti . \n \nPs  =  1  -  Pt  =  e \u2013x(t - ti)                            [2] \n \n \n \nUnplated Specimens \nA Weibull plot of the times to failure in the slow strain rate tests for specimens that had been \nquenched and tempered but not electroplated is shown in Fig 2.  All of the specimens failed \nin times ranging between 17 and 21 hours with a mean time of 18.9 hours. \n \n \nEffect of Zinc-Cobalt and Cadmium Plating \nThe effect of electroplating specimens with 8 microns of cadmium or zinc-1%cobalt was to \npromote hydrogen embrittlement of the steel and reduce the times to failure.  The results for \nthese two coatings are compared in Fig 3.  The cadmium caused more embrittlement with a \nmean time to failure of 4.2 hours compared to 7.0 hours for the zinc-cobalt. \n \nAfter baking at 200\u00b0C for 24 hours to promote loss of hydrogen from the surface, specimens \nthat had been plated with cadmium showed full recovery of mechanical properties and the \nmean time to failure was restored to that of the unplated controls (Fig 4).  The statistical \nStudent t-test (8) was used to confirm (95% confidence) that the failure times of the baked \ncadmium plated specimens and the control specimens were part of the same population.  \nSimilarly, it was demonstrated that the baking heat-treatment did not affect the times to \nfailure of the control specimens.  In contrast, baking the zinc-cobalt plated specimens for 24 \nhours gave incomplete recovery and the times to failure were still only 89% of those for the \ncontrols.  Additional tests were performed in which the baking time was increased to 48 \nhours but their recovery only increased to 91%. \n \nThe pH of the zinc-cobalt plating bath had an influence on the times to failure, as shown by \nthe results in Table 4.  Raising the pH from the standard condition of 4.2 to a value of 5 \ndecreased the time to failure whereas plating at pH 1, which might have been expected to \nincrease the hydrogen uptake, had the effect of reducing the hydrogen embrittlement.  The \nreasons for these changes are discussed later. \n \n 5\nTable 4  Effect of Zn-Co bath pH on failure times in slow strain rate tests \n \nBath pH Time to Failure   (hours) \n1 7.2 \n3 6.3 \n   4.2 7.0 \n5 4.5 \n \n \nComparison with Pure Zinc Plating \nIn order to investigate the embrittlement promoted by zinc-cobalt coatings in more detail, \ncomparison was made with the times to failure of specimens electroplated with pure zinc.  It \nwas found that pure zinc promoted more embrittlement than zinc-1%cobalt, with a mean time \nto failure of 5.6 hours, as shown in Fig 5.  The presence of just 1%Co in the zinc-cobalt alloy \nwas beneficial in reducing the extent of embrittlement.  Like the zinc-1%cobalt coating, \nbaking the pure zinc plated specimens did not fully restore their mechanical properties and \nthey failed in 87% of the time of the unplated controls. \n \nZinc-10%Nickel Plating \nThe results for electroplated Zn-10%nickel are included in Fig 5.  The mean time to failure of \n18.2 hours indicates that very little hydrogen embrittlement was promoted by this coating.  It \nhad been shown in an earlier study (9) that the reason that zinc-nickel alloys cause only a low \nlevel of embrittlement is that the first material to deposit on the surface of the steel has a \nhigher nickel content than the remainder of the coating.  Nickel has a very low diffusion \ncoefficient for hydrogen (10), in the order of 8 x 10-10 cm2s-1, and the nickel-rich interlayer acts \nas a barrier to the diffusion of hydrogen from the coating into the steel. \n \nIn the case of the zinc-1%cobalt coatings it was expected that a cobalt-rich layer would form \nat the coating\/substrate interface.  If cobalt also acts as a barrier to hydrogen then this would \nexplain why these coatings caused less hydrogen embrittlement than pure zinc coatings.  \n \nEffects of Nickel and Cobalt Interlayers \nTo test this hypothesis tests were carried out in which the slow strain rate specimens were \nelectroplated by a double bath treatment (DBT); first with a 0.5 micron interlayer of either \npure cobalt or pure nickel, followed by 8 microns of zinc, zinc-10%cobalt or zinc-10%nickel.  \nThe results for each of these coatings are shown in Fig 6.  The least embrittlement was caused \nby electroplating a zinc-10%nickel coating over a 0.5 micron layer of nickel, confirming the \nbeneficial effects of nickel as a barrier to hydrogen diffusion.  A particularly significant result \nis that the nickel interlayer was also effective in lowering the embrittlement of a zinc-cobalt \ncoating to that of zinc-nickel.  This could have important practical benefits as a means of \nproducing zinc-cobalt coatings with the minimum risk of causing hydrogen embrittlement. \n \nThe cobalt interlayer also appeared to reduce the extent of embrittlement but it was not nearly \nas effective as the interlayer of nickel (Fig 6).  The results for zinc-cobalt deposited over 0.5 \nmicrons of cobalt were very similar to those for zinc over cobalt and to those of zinc-cobalt \nalone.  Surprisingly zinc-nickel, when plated by itself, caused little embrittlement but when \ncoated over cobalt gave a similar amount of embrittlement to these other coatings.  It would \nappear that in each case the level of embrittlement was controlled by the hydrogen trapped in \nthe cobalt layer at the steel surface rather than that in the remainder of the coating. \n 6\n \nInfluence of Baking Treatment \nThe effects of baking the zinc-cobalt coatings with the cobalt and nickel interlayers are \nshown in Fig 7.  An important observation was that in both cases virtually full recovery was \nachieved.  As baking the zinc-cobalt coating that did not have an interlayer failed to restore \nits properties to those of the unplated controls it is assumed that the presence of a thin layer of \ncobalt can have a significant effect.  It is thought that a cobalt interlayer acts as a sufficient \nbarrier to hydrogen that during baking the hydrogen in the coating escapes to atmosphere \nrather than diffusing into the steel. \n \nZinc-Cobalt-Iron Plating \nThe results for the zinc-12%cobalt-9%iron alloy were very promising as shown in Fig 8.  \nThis coating was the least embrittling of the zinc-cobalt alloys tested with a mean time to \nfailure of 10.8 hours compared to 5.6 hours for zinc, 7.0 hours for zinc-1%cobalt and 7.2 \nhours for zinc-cobalt plated over a cobalt interlayer. \n \nEmbrittlement Indices \nThe extent of hydrogen embrittlement caused by a particular process is frequently assessed \nby comparing values of the embrittlement index (EI), which is defined as;- \n \nEI  =  1  -  (tp\/tc)                     [3] \n \nwhere tp and tc are the times to failure of the plated specimens and controls respectively.  The \nmean embrittlement indices for the different plating processes are compared in Table 5.  \nClearly, the indices depend on the susceptibility of the steel in addition to the tendency of the \nelectrodeposit to promote hydrogen uptake but values above 0.6 are generally taken to \nindicate severe embrittlement. \n \n \nTable 5   Embrittlement indices for each plating process \n \nCoating Embrittlement Index \n         Cadmium                  0.78 \n         Zn                  0.7 \n         Zn-1%Co  (pH 4.2)                  0.63 \n         Zn-1%Co  baked                  0.11 \n         Zn-Co-Fe                  0.43 \n         Zn-10%Ni                  0.037 \n \n \n \nDISCUSSION                            \n \nThe results show that electrodeposited Zn-1%Co coatings promote high levels of hydrogen \nembrittlement in a susceptible high strength steel substrate (Fig 3).  This embrittlement was \nmuch greater than that caused by Zn-10%Ni plating but not quite as severe as that for pure \nzinc or cadmium (Figs 3,5 & Table 5). \n \n 7\nNoble Metal Enrichment \nThe lower risk of embrittlement from zinc-10%nickel coatings is attributed to the deposition \nof a nickel-rich layer in the first stages of electroplating (9).  Nickel is an effective barrier to \nhydrogen uptake by the steel from the coating as it has a very low coefficient for hydrogen \ndiffusion (10).  This conclusion is supported by the results for the dual bath treatments in \nwhich a 0.5 micron layer of nickel deposited beneath a zinc-1%cobalt layer reduced hydrogen \nembrittlement to the level caused by zinc-10%nickel alone (Fig 6). \n \nThe nickel-rich layer forms initially during electrodeposition by a \u2018normal\u2019 plating process as \nnickel is electrochemically a more noble element than zinc.  It is only after the pH at the \ncathode surface has risen to 5.3 that whiskers of zinc hydroxide form, suppressing nickel \ndeposition and allowing zinc to be reduced and deposited by the anomalous codeposition \nmechanism (11). \n \nIt was expected that a cobalt-rich layer would form in a similar way in the early stages of \nzinc-cobalt electroplating and that the presence of this layer was responsible for the partial \nreduction in the severe embrittlement caused by pure zinc coatings.  Indeed, a cobalt-rich \nlayer, containing 7%Co, was detected at the coating\/substrate interface using EDX and Auger \nelectron spectroscopy (12) and other published work on a similar electroplated zinc-cobalt \nalloy reported that an initial layer containing 10% cobalt forms in the early stages of plating \n(13).   In the present study, thicker cobalt-rich layers were formed in deposits plated at a lower \nbath pH, due to the longer time needed to establish the surface pH of 5.3 for the onset of \nanomalous codeposition.  The longest time to failure and the lowest hydrogen uptake \noccurred with deposits plated at pH 1, where the thickest cobalt-rich layer was formed.  \nConversely, the shortest times and highest hydrogen uptake corresponded to plating at pH 5 \nat which the least cobalt enrichment took place.  \n \nEffectiveness of Baking Treatment \nThe results in Fig 4 showed that although the baking treatment was effective in removing \nabsorbed hydrogen and reducing the risk of embrittlement in cadmium plated steel it did not \ngive full recovery with zinc-cobalt alloy coatings.  The specimens still failed in 89% of the \ntime of the unplated controls, which was similar to the behaviour of specimens plated with \npure zinc.  Even after baking, the risk of an embrittlement failure in a zinc-cobalt plated \nspecimen was greater than that for zinc-10%Ni plating without a baking treatment (Table 5). \n \nIt is possible that the zinc and zinc-cobalt electrodeposits were in a form that was relatively \nimpervious to hydrogen so that it did not all escape to atmosphere during baking.  In these \ncircumstances, a proportion of the hydrogen would remain trapped in the steel and may lead \nto a delayed failure when a stress is subsequently applied. \n \nThe composition of the first deposit to form on the substrate has a controlling effect both on \nhydrogen uptake and its loss from the surface during baking.  When a 0.5micron cobalt \ninterlayer was deposited beneath a zinc-1%cobalt coating nearly 100% recovery of properties \nwas achieved by baking.  The cobalt interlayer is thought to have acted as a barrier to \nhydrogen so that during baking the hydrogen in the coating escaped to atmosphere rather than \ndiffusing into the steel. \n  \n \n 8\nCONCLUSIONS \n \n [1]  Zinc-1%cobalt alloy coatings electrodeposited on a quenched and tempered AISI 4340 \nhigh strength steel substrate resulted in serious hydrogen embrittlement of the steel \n(Embrittlement Index 0.63).  However, this embrittlement was less severe than that caused by \ncadmium or zinc electroplating  (Embrittlement Indices 0.78 and 0.7 respectively). \n \n[2 ]  The least embrittlement from zinc-1%cobalt occurred  when the coatings were deposited \nat pH1 due to the formation of a cobalt-rich layer at the coating\/substrate interface.  In \ncontrast, the greatest embrittlement arose from plating at pH 5 when the cobalt-rich layer was \nnot detected. \n \n[3]  The mechanical properties of cadmium electroplated specimens recovered fully after a 24 \nhour baking treatment at 200\u00b0C, whereas specimens that had been plated with zinc-1%cobalt \nand then baked still failed in 89% of the time of unplated controls. \n \n[4]  Even after a baking treatment, the risk of an embrittlement failure in a zinc-1%cobalt \nplated specimen was greater than that caused by an unbaked zinc-10%nickel plating. \n \n[5]  A 0.5 micron cobalt interlayer deposited before the zinc-1%cobalt coating gave virtually \n100% recovery of mechanical properties after baking.  It is thought that the cobalt layer acted \nas a sufficient barrier to hydrogen that during the baking treatment the hydrogen in the \ncoating escaped to atmosphere rather than diffusing into the steel. \n \n[6]  Of the coatings tested, the least hydrogen embrittlement was caused by electroplated \nzinc-10%nickel (Embrittlement Index 0.037).  This was attributed to the formation of a layer \nat the coating\/substrate interface that was enriched in nickel, which is known to have a very \nlow hydrogen diffusion coefficient. \n \n[7 ]  A 0.5 micron nickel interlayer was effective in lowering the embrittlement caused by \nzinc-1%cobalt to that of zinc-10%nickel.  This finding offers a practical method of reducing \nthe risk of embrittlement associated with zinc-cobalt coatings. \n \n[8]  The results for the zinc-12%cobalt-9%iron alloy were very promising as this coating \ncaused  the least embrittlement of the zinc-cobalt alloys tested (Embrittlement Index 0.43). \n \n \nAcknowledgement;  The authors acknowledge QinetiQ, Farnborough for the support of this \nwork funded through the MOD Corporate Research Programme \n 9\nREFERENCES \n \n[1]  A Brenner, Electrodeposition of Alloys, Vol 1, Academic Press, New York, p 75, (1963) \n \n[2]  K.Higashi, H.Fukushima, T.Urakawa, T.Adaniya & K.Matsudo, \u2018Mechanism of the \nElectrodeposition of Zinc Alloys Containing a Small Amount of Cobalt.\u2019  J.Electrochem. \nSoc., Vol 128, No 10, pp 2081-2085, (1981) \n \n[3]  A.Abibsi, N.Short & K.Denis, Corrosion Resistance of Zinc Alloy Coatings, Trans.
