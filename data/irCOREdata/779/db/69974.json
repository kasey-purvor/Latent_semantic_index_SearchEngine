Introduction\n[2] The traditional definition of a geomagnetic storm\nfocuses of the strength of the Dst perturbation produced\nduring the storm [e.g., Gonzalez et al., 1994]. Storms driven\nby high speed solar wind streams (HSS-driven storms) are\nnot generally associated with large signatures in the Dst\nindex, i.e., they do not produce a particularly strong ring\ncurrent. Storms driven by coronal mass ejections impacting\non the magnetosphere (CME-driven storms) are much more\neffective at creating a strong ring current and producing\nlarge Dst signatures, and the majority of previous research\nattention has been focused on these types of storms.\n[3] Over the past few years the importance of HSS-driven\nstorms has become increasingly accepted across the\ncommunity [e.g., Gonzalez et al., 1999; Turner et al.,\n2006; Denton et al., 2006; McPherron and Weygand, 2006;\nTsurutani et al., 2006; Borovsky and Denton, 2006a]. These\nevents produce storm-levels of magnetospheric phenomena\n(e.g., enhanced convection, plasma heating, particle precip-\nitation, relativistic electron energization etc.) which persist\nfor an extended time period (e.g., many days) in contrast to\nCME events where more transient driving (e.g., 1 d) is the\nnorm. As such, the energy input to the magnetosphere during\nHSSs is comparable or may exceed the energy input to the\nmagnetosphere during CMEs [Turner et al., 2006]. A review\nof the major differences between CME-driven storms and\nHSS-driven storms may be found by Borovsky and Denton\n[2006a].\n[4] The current study follows on from previous compar-\nisons between CME-driven storms and HSS-driven storms\ncarried out using data from geosynchronous orbit [e.g.,\nDenton et al., 2005, 2006; Lavraud et al., 2006; Longden\net al., 2008; Borovsky and Denton, 2008a]. However, in\ncontrast to studies which used the Dst index as the zero\nepoch for superposed epoch analyses, the analyses carried\nout in this study use the onset of convection to order the\ndata. This ordering is proving crucial to revealing new\nfeatures of the response of the plasma sheet and plasma-\nsphere densities, temperatures and flow velocities during\nHSS-driven storms. The present study also uses a larger set\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A07216, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012998, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\n2Space Science and Applications, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los\nAlamos, New Mexico, USA.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012998$09.00\nA07216 1 of 9\nof more carefully selected events and contrasts two subsets\nof these to reveal differences between calm and more active\noccasions.\n2. Data Sets and Superposed Epoch Analyses\n[5] Electrostatic magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA)\ninstruments flown on several Los Alamos National Labo-\nratory (LANL) satellites provide an unrivalled database of\nmeasurements from geosynchronous orbit that currently\ncontains the equivalent of over 20000 individual orbits.\nThe hot ion plasma (0.1\u201345 keV), the hot electron plasma\n(0.03\u201345 keV) and the cold ion plasma (1\u2013100 eV) are\nsampled at a cadence of 86 s. Spin-averaged moments of the\nfull distributions are then calculated to provide the density,\ntemperature and flow-velocities of the ions (all ions are\nassumed to be protons) and the density and temperature of\nthe electrons as described by Thomsen et al. [1999]. The\nflow velocities are calculated in the satellite frame of\nreference where the x axis lies in the approximate north-\nsouth geographic plane (positive north), the y axis is the\neast-west plane (positive east), and the z axis points radially\ntoward the Earth\u2019s center (positive inward). A full descrip-\ntion of the MPA instrument is provided by Bame et al.\n[1993] and McComas et al. [1993].\n[6] Plasma sampled at geosynchronous orbit by MPA has\npreviously been shown to be sourced from two regions:\n(1) inflow from the solar wind, and (2) outflow of cold\nmaterial from the Earth\u2019s ionosphere [e.g., Borovsky et al.,\n1997]. To investigate the relative contribution of these\nsources to the plasma sampled at geosynchronous orbit,\ntwo data sets are used. The high-resolution 1-min OMNI\ndatabase of solar wind parameters [e.g., King and Papitash-\nvili, 2005] is utilized to estimate the contribution of (1) and\nalso to confirm that the solar wind properties during the\nanalyses are indeed characteristic of high speed solar wind\nstreams. The MPA measurements of the cold plasma them-\nselves are used to estimate the contribution of (2).\n[7] The storm event selection was made as follows.\nInitially, a list of stream interfaces in the solar wind are\nselected (1995\u20132002) based on typical HSS signatures such\nas E\/W flow shear, increase in solar wind speed, etc.\n[McPherron and Weygand, 2006; R. McPherron, private\ncommunication, 2006]. Further events are selected based in\nthe first instance on direct inspection of solar wind proper-\nties (1995\u20132005), and subsequently on the convection onset\nfrom the Kp index. Finally, the exact time of convection\nonset for each event is determined by examination of\nthe midnight boundary index (MBI) [Madden and\nGussenhoven, 1990], a measure of the equatorwards edge\nof auroral precipitation. This index is known to respond to\nincreases in magnetospheric convection and provides a\nmore precise onset time than other convection-related\nindices such as Kp [Thomsen, 2004]. The final result of\nthe event selection process is a list of 124 events where\nHSS-driven activity leads to magnetospheric convection\nonset. Onset times are determined to 30 minute accuracy.\nThe number of HSS events from each year 1993\u20132005 is\nshown in Table 1.\n[8] By utilizing this list of events, superposed epoch\nanalyses are carried out on the hot and cold ion densities,\ntemperatures and flow velocities and the hot electron\ndensity and temperature. In a similar manner to previous\nanalyses, magnetosheath and boundary layer events are\nexcluded by limiting the data to periods when the perpen-\ndicular hot ion temperature exceeds 2000 eVand the hot ion\ndensity is less than 5 cm\u00023 [Korth et al., 1999; Denton et\nal., 2005]. Analyses are then performed by extracting the\ndata from all available LANL satellites during each of\nthe 124 convection events, and ordering these data based\non the epoch of convection onset. Data are binned according\nto epoch time (2 h resolution) and local time (1 h resolution)\nfrom 2 d prior to the convection onset to 4 d following\nconvection onset. The resulting series of plots show selected\nMPA parameters, with zero epoch being the time of con-\nvection onset. Bins with less than five contributing data\npoints are colored grey. The plots of MPA data are com-\nplemented with a series of superposed epoch plots of solar\nwind parameters (on a 1-min timescale) for the same list of\nevents. (Note: since data in both the MPA and the solar wind\nanalyses are selected from a 6 d period based on UT, and\nsubsequently assigned to a 6 d period based on epoch time,\nthe final day of the epoch analysis contain fewer points than\nother days. However, the full 6 d epoch period is included to\ndemonstrate the trends shown in the plots typically continue\nbeyond the 4 d following convection onset).\n3. Solar Wind Behavior\n[9] Figure 1 shows the superposed epoch analysis for\nselected solar wind parameters for the 103 events from\nTable 1 for which solar wind data were available. The\ntrigger time marked by the dashed line is the zero epoch,\nthe onset of magnetospheric convection. The parameters\nindicate that the solar wind prior to, and during, these events\nis typical of high speed solar wind streams impacting on the\nmagnetosphere [e.g., Tsurutani et al., 2006; McPherron and\nWeygand, 2006; Kavanagh and Denton, 2007; Denton et\nal., 2008] with a west-to-east deflection in the solar wind\nflow velocity (the corotating interaction region), a maxima\nin the solar wind density and magnetic field, and an increase\nin the magnitude of solar wind velocity which persists for\nmany days. Note, in the bottom panel of Figure 1 that the\nzero epoch, the onset of magnetospheric convection, occurs\na few hours prior to the solar wind stream interface which is\nthe west-to-east deflection in the solar wind.\n[10] Figure 2 shows the superposed, averaged Kp and Dst\nindices for all events (with the Kp index converted to a\ndigital value). The Kp index indicates a sharp onset of\nconvection around zero epoch. At this time, the averaged\nDst falls slightly and remains slightly depressed (Dst \u0001\n\u000220) during the events, but never reaches a level typical of\neven \u2018\u2018minor storm\u2019\u2019 conditions. Despite the low levels of\nTable 1.

Hot Ion Density, Temperature,\nand Flow Velocity\n[11] MPA instruments are distributed on satellites in\ngeosynchronous orbit and continuously sample the plasma\nenvironment in this region at all local times. Statistically, the\nion plasma sheet bathes geosynchronous orbit around local\nmidnight during periods of low convection and the region\nwhere plasma sheet ions are detected spreads to either side\nof local midnight as convection increases. In addition, the\ndensity of the ion plasma sheet is known to increase with\nincreased convection strength [e.g., Korth et al., 1999;\nDenton et al., 2005; Thomsen et al., 2007; O\u2019Brien and\nLemon, 2007]. Previous superposed-epoch analyses of the\nstorm-time evolution of plasma sheet material used the\nminimum value of Dst as the zero epoch and results indicate\nthat the density of the plasma sheet increases rapidly during\nthe onset and main phase of the storm and that the ion\nplasma sheet density and composition are strongly solar\ncycle dependent [e.g., Young et al., 1982; Denton et al.,\n2005. 2006; Zhang et al., 2006; Thomsen et al., 2007;\nMacDonald et al., 2008].\n[12] Figure 3 shows the results of superposed epoch\nanalyses for the hot ion (0.1\u201345 keV) density, temperature\nand the east\/west flow velocity for all 124 events in this\nstudy using convection onset as the zero epoch. Prior to\nconvection onset, the hot ions of the plasma sheet have\ntypical densities which are higher on the nightside than the\ndayside. Following convection onset the ion density\nincreases indicating the delivery of fresh material from\ntailwards of geosynchronous orbit. This material is partic-\nularly dense around the initial onset, predominantly on the\nnightside, although enhanced densities may be found at all\nlocal times. The fact that the arrival of dense solar wind\nplasma at the Earth\u2019s magnetopause is roughly coincidental\nwith the measurement of dense material in the plasma sheet\nimplies a correlation between the two, a correlation previ-\nously studied by Borovsky et al. [1998a]. This relation is\ninvestigated further in section 7.\n[13] The temperature of the ion plasma sheet increases\nsharply at convection onset, a result that was previously less\nclear in the Denton et al. [2005, 2006] studies due to the\nchoice of the Dst index as the zero epoch. Here, the\ncorrelation between the high solar wind flow speed for\nthese events, and the subsequent increase in the ion plasma\nsheet temperature [e.g., Borovsky et al., 1998a; Tsyganenko\nand Mukai, 2003; Denton and Taylor, 2008; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2008a] is much more evident. The fresh material\ndelivered to the inner magnetosphere at the time of convec-\ntion onset is sourced from the magnetotail [e.g., Borovsky et\nal., 1998b] and is particularly hot and dense with an\naveraged peak number density of \u00011.6 cm\u00023, compared\nwith the typical number density in the plasma sheet of\n\u00010.7 cm\u00023 [Borovsky et al., 1997]. Following convection\nonset, this hot, dense, material is seen at geosynchronous\norbit for \u000120 h. After this time, the plasma sheet remains at\nFigure 1. Superposed solar wind parameters for the 103 events from Table 1 for which solar wind data\nwere available. The zero epoch is the onset of magnetospheric convection. The solar wind shows typical\ncharacteristics of high speed solar wind streams.\nFigure 2. Superposed Dst and Kp indices for all 124\nevents. Values of Kp in excess of 3 are colored dark grey.\nA07216 DENTON AND BOROVSKY: SUPERPOSED EPOCH ANALYSIS OF HSS\n3 of 9\nA07216\nan elevated temperature while the fast solar wind prevails,\nalthough the number density of the plasma sheet begins to\nfall to values closer to the average density of \u00010.7 cm\u00023\naround a day after convection onset.\n[14] The averaged hot ion east\/west flow velocity is\nplotted in the bottom panel of Figure 3. Prior to convection\nonset, the measured flow is consistent with corotation.\nFollowing convection onset, there is a sudden change and\nthe averaged motion is strongly local-time dependent with\neastward (dawn) and westward (dusk) flows. This pattern\nrepresents sunward flow of hot plasma on the dawn and\ndusk sides of the magnetosphere. Averaged flow velocities\nof \u000110 km s\u00021 are seen early in the storms, with flow\nspeeds decreasing as the events progress.\nFigure 3. Superposed epoch analyses for hot ion (0.1\u2013\n45 keV) density, temperature, and east-west flow velocity\nfor all 124 events.\nFigure 4. Superposed epoch analyses for hot electron\n(0.03\u201345 keV) density, temperature and pressure for all\n124 events.\nA07216 DENTON AND BOROVSKY: SUPERPOSED EPOCH ANALYSIS OF HSS\n4 of 9\nA07216\n[15] Note that the superdense plasma sheet seen in\nFigure 3 is not the cool dense plasma sheet. Previous\ninvestigations of cold, dense plasma sheet access to geo-\nsynchronous orbit indicate that the inward transport of such\nmaterial occurs at the onset of enhanced convection [e.g.,\nTerasawa et al., 1997; Fujimoto et al., 1998; Thomsen et al.,\n2003; Lavraud et al., 2005, 2006]. However, such material\nis only observed at geosynchronous orbit for \u00011 h following\nconvection onset, and thus although such material is\ndetected during some of the 124 events in the current study,\nits presence is overwhelmed by the hot dense material\nwhich dominates the averages presented here.\n5. Hot Electron Density and Temperature\n[16] In conjunction with the hot ion plasma sheet, the hot\nelectron (0.03\u201345 keV) plasma sheet also bathes geosyn-\nchronous orbit during quiet times, in the region close to\nlocal midnight. Because of the predominantly eastward drift\npaths of electrons, the electron plasma sheet is centered\nslightly eastward (dawnwards) compared to the ion plasma\nsheet. The density of the electron plasma sheet increases\nwith increased convection strength [e.g., Korth et al.,\n1999; Denton et al., 2005] and the region where plasma\nsheet electrons are detected at geosynchronous orbit\nwidens dawnwards and duskwards of local midnight as\nconvection increases. The electron plasma sheet is also\nknown to be highly solar cycle dependent with the density\naround a factor of two higher at solar maximum compared\nto solar minimum [e.g., Denton et al., 2005; Thomsen et\nal., 2007].\n[17] Figure 4 shows the results of superposed epoch\nanalyses for the hot electron density and temperature for\nall 124 events. The hot electron density reacts similarly to\nthe hot ion density, increasing dramatically at convection\nonset. These electrons are also hot and superdense, in\ncomparison to average plasma sheet density and tempera-\nture, and this dense material persists for \u000120 h before being\nreplaced by a population of electrons with a density more\ncharacteristic of the average electron plasma sheet. The\nelectron temperature in the plasma sheet remains elevated\nwhile the fast solar wind prevails and this has consequences\nfor differential surface charging of spacecraft in this envi-\nronment. As demonstrated by Denton et al. [2006], the\nspacecraft surface charging measured by MPA is signifi-\ncantly elevated for many days following the arrival of high\nspeed streams at geosynchronous orbit in comparison to\nCME-driven storms where elevated spacecraft charging is\nless intense and more transient.\n[18] Figure 4 also shows the electron pressure (the\nproduct of the electron density and temperature) which\nincreases rapidly across the entire nightside following\nconvection onset. Because of the MPA instrument char-\nacteristics, the hot electron flow velocity measurements\nby MPA have proved difficult to quantify and are not\npresented in this study.\n6. Cold Ion Density and Flow Velocity: The\nPlasmasphere and Plumes\n[19] Cold plasmaspheric material is frequently sampled at\ngeosynchronous orbit during calm geomagnetic conditions\nFigure 5. Superposed epoch analyses for cold ions\n(1\u2013100 eV) showing density, plume occurrence, the y axis\nflow velocity (positive east), the z axis flow velocity\n(positive Earthwards) and flow speed for all 124 events.\nA07216 DENTON AND BOROVSKY: SUPERPOSED EPOCH ANALYSIS OF HSS\n5 of 9\nA07216\nand quiet convection intervals. During such times, the\nplasmasphere fills from the lower ionosphere and may be\ndetected at geosynchronous orbit on the dusk side of the\nEarth, in the region known as the \u2018\u2018plasmaspheric bulge\u2019\u2019\n[e.g., Chappell et al., 1970; Higel and Lei, 1984]. During\nextended periods of calm, the plasmasphere is sampled at\nall local times around geosynchronous orbit (e.g., Borovsky\nand Denton, 2008b) while during the most active periods,\nthe plasmasphere may be depleted into around L = 2 [Brace\net al., 1974] and hence the plasmasphere is not observable\nby MPA. Filling or \u2018\u2018preconditioning\u2019\u2019 of the plasmasphere\nduring intervals of calm has long been known from obser-\nvation and theory - the plasmasphere takes between a few\ndays to periods in excess of two weeks to reach a com-\npletely \u2018\u2018ful\u2019\u2019 state [e.g., Kersley and Klobuchar, 1980].\n[20] Plasmaspheric erosion occurs when an increase in\nthe convective electric field penetrates into the plasma-\nsphere and the outer layers move to open drift paths which\nterminate on the dayside magnetopause. Such erosion leads\nto the formation of a plasmaspheric drainage plume [e.g.,\nGrebowsky, 1970; Spiro et al., 1981]. Recent observations\nindicate that as this cold, dense plasmaspheric material\nmoves toward the dayside magnetopause, it reduces the\ncoupling between the solar wind and the magnetosphere, a\nresult predicted by Borovsky and Steinberg [2006], observed\nusing MPA observations by Borovsky and Denton [2006b],\nexplained based on plasma reconnection physics by Cassack\nand Shay [2007], and recently discussed and modeled by\nBorovsky et al. [2008]. The role of the plasmasphere in the\nacceleration and loss of relativistic electrons is also the\nsubject of much previous and current research [e.g.,\nCornwall et al., 1970; Meredith et al., 2003; Thorne et al.,\n2006; Jordanova et al., 2006; Liemohn and Chan, 2007;\nReeves, 2007; Rodger et al., 2007; Borovsky and Denton,\n2008a, 2008b] and hence, observations of the plasmasphere\nand plasmaspheric plumes at geosynchronous orbit are im-\nportant in understanding both local ionosphere\/plasmasphere\ndynamics, as well as being highly important for other\nmagnetospheric phenomena.\n[21] The top panel of Figure 5 shows the averaged cold\n(1\u2013100 eV) ion density as function of epoch time and local\ntime, for all 124 events. Prior to the convection onset, the\nplasmasphere is sampled at most local times around geosyn-\nchronous orbit, except for the region close to local midnight.\nFollowing the onset of magnetospheric convection at zero\nepoch, the outer layers of the plasmasphere are eroded, and\nMPA then samples plume material in the postnoon sector.\nThe sampled plume material is initially very dense (individ-\nual densities in these events frequently exceed 100 cm\u00023),\nalthough the densities fall from an average of >20 cm\u00023 at\nconvection onset to an average of\u000115 cm\u00023 around 24 h after\nzero epoch. MPA continues to sample plume material in the\npostnoon sector during the entire 4 d period following the\nonset of convection. The second panel of Figure 5 shows\nthe \u2018\u2018plume occurrence frequency,\u2019\u2019 the fraction of time that\nhigh density (>10 cm\u00023) cold plasma is observed at geosyn-\nchronous orbit. The calculated \u2018\u2018high density plume occur-\nrence frequency\u2019\u2019 (plasma density >10 cm\u00023) is shown as a\npercentage of the total number of observations. As can be\nseen, high density material is observed \u000175% of the time in\nthe region around 15 LT and 25% of the time 3 d later.\n[22] The averaged, superposed y axis flow velocity (pos-\nitive east) and the z axis flow velocity (positive Earthwards)\nare also presented in Figure 5 (satellite frame-of-reference)\nalong with magnitude of the flow velocity in the y-z plane. To\nensure that plasmaspheric material dominates the statistics,\nvelocities are only included in the analysis if the cold plasma\ndensity exceeds 10 cm\u00023. Prior to convection onset, the cold\nplasma shows peaks in the east-west flow velocities at dawn\nand dusk, consistent with super-rotation at dawn and sub-\nrotation at dusk. Following the onset of magnetospheric\nconvection, the cold plasma flow speeds measured by MPA\nincrease suddenly, and are direct measures of the convection\nspeed of the eroded plume material (in the satellite frame-of-\nreference) as this cold plasma moves toward the dayside\nmagnetopause. Plume material is flowing sunwards (toward\nthe dayside magnetopause) with a convection speed of \u00018\u2013\n12 km s\u00021. Previous measurements of convection speed in\nthe region close to geosynchronous orbit indicate a con-\nvection speed of the same order as those presented here\n[e.g., Borovsky et al., 1998b; Denton et al., 2007; Borovsky\nand Denton, 2008a].\n[23] In a complementary study, [Borovsky and Denton,\n2008a] examine the statistical properties of drainage plumes\nas measured by MPA for the same storm events. As in the\ncurrent study, they find that the cold plasma of the plumes is\nsunward flowing. They find that plumes persist for the full\n4 d after the storm onset, but that drainage plumes weaken\nas the storms progress [cf. Goldstein and Sandel, 2005], i.e.,\nthe plumes become narrower in local time with plasma\nFigure 6. Superposed epoch analyses of the solar wind density, and the 24-h local-time-integrated hot\n(0.1\u201345 keV) and cold (1\u2013100 eV) ion densities at geosynchronous orbit. Cold ion densities are divided\nby 10 to fit on the same scale.\nA07216 DENTON AND BOROVSKY: SUPERPOSED EPOCH ANALYSIS OF HSS\n6 of 9\nA07216\ndensities that are lower. These findings are consistent with\nthe interpretation of the superposed epoch observations of\nFigure 5.\n7. Discussion\n[24] The detailed superposed analyses presented above\nfurther demonstrate the significant changes that HSS-driven\nstorms can impose upon the inner magnetosphere, despite\nthe relatively weak ring current and subsequent minor\ndeflections of the Dst index. Driven by fast solar wind,\nwith high density on the leading edge of the stream [e.g.,\nTsurutani et al., 2006], such events create conditions where\nstrong magnetospheric convection persists for many days.\nThis prolonged convection induces plasma sheet conditions\nwhere hot, superdense ions and electrons are followed by an\nextended period of hot plasma of normal density.\n7.1. Solar Wind Source of the Superdense\nPlasma Sheet\n[25] The fact that the arrival of dense solar wind plasma at\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetopause occurs roughly coincidentally\nFigure 7. Superposed epoch analyses for cold ions (1\u2013100 eV) showing density, plume occurrence and\nthe superposed Kp and Dst indices, for events where (a) an extended period of very calm convection\npreceded the convection onset (left column), and (b) convection was somewhat elevated prior to the\nconvection onset (right column).\nA07216 DENTON AND BOROVSKY: SUPERPOSED EPOCH ANALYSIS OF HSS\n7 of 9\nA07216\nwith the measurement of dense material in the plasma sheet\nimplies a correlation between the two, a subject previously\nstudied by Borovsky et al. [1998a]. To determine if this\nrelationship is observable using superposed epoch analyses\nof plasma sheet density, the solar wind density is plotted in\nFigure 6 along with the 24-h local-time-integrated hot and\ncold densities.\n[26] The 24-h local-time integrated cold plasma sheet\nions (blue) shown in Figure 6 indicate the rapid erosion\nof the plasmasphere at convection onset. It also is clear that\nthe solar wind density (green) and 24-h local-time integrated\nhot plasma sheet ion density (red) shown in Figure 6 track\neach other well, with the peak in solar wind density\noccurring prior to the peak in the plasma sheet ion density.\nThis observation implies that the superdense plasma sheet\nobserved during high speed solar wind streams is primarily\ncomposed of solar wind plasma, captured following con-\nvection onset. The peak-to-peak delay between the two is\n\u00014 h which matches the time delay for solar wind-to-\nplasma sheet transport of \u00014 h determined by Borovsky et\nal. [1998a] using data from multiple MPA satellites.\n7.2. Calms Before the Storm and Drainage Plumes\n[27] Figure 6 also contains a plot of the local-time\naveraged cold ion density which falls off rapidly following\nconvection onset due to erosion on the plasmasphere. Rapid\nconvection onsets have profound effects for the cold plasma\nwithin the plasmasphere. Convection is rarely steady and\nchanges in convection are known to cause rapid evolution of\nplasmaspheric plumes [e.g., Goldstein and Sandel., 2005].\n[28] To investigate what effect a \u2018\u2018full\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018partially\ndepleted\u2019\u2019 plasmasphere has upon plume formation, and\nsubsequent plume evolution, two subsets of the complete set\nof 124 events are generated. These subsets are derived\nbased on visual inspection of the convection-related indices\n(Kp and MBI). Calm-onset events (A-events: 24 cases) are\nevents for which the convection onset occurs following a\nperiod of very low convection (Kp \u0001 0). Disturbed-onset\nevents (B-events: 41 cases) are events for which the\nconvection onset occurs following mild convection (Kp \u0001\n2). Superposed epoch analyses of the cold (1\u2013100 eV) ion\ndensity and plume occurrence frequency for the A-events\nand B-events and their respective geomagnetic indices (Kp\nand Dst), are presented in Figure 7. (Note: a diagonal striped\nappearance is evident in some parts of the plots (stripes\nfrom top-to-bottom, left-to-right) in Figure 7. This is due to\nthe averages occasionally being dominated by exceptionally\nhigh\/low values from a single satellite). The average con-\nditions after onset were similar for both sets of events with\nthe A-events only slightly stronger in terms of convection\n(Kp) and ring current strength (Dst). In Figure 7 note the\ndifference in the Kp index prior to the onset for the two sets\nof events. In the cold plasma density plots it is clear that the\nplasmasphere prior to the A-events (calms) was substantial-\nly denser that for the B-events (no calms). At convection\nonset, this leads to the formation of a plume where the\ndensity is at least twice the density for the B-events. Thus\nsignificantly more material drains to the magnetopause from\na \u2018\u2018full\u2019\u2019 plasmasphere than from a partially depleted plas-\nmasphere and this increase leads to a more plumes. The\neffects of this cold material as it is redistributed in the inner\nmagnetosphere have only recently begun to be investigated\n[e.g., Borovsky and Denton, 2006b].\n8. Summary\n[29] The most salient findings of the current study are\nsummarized below.\n[30] 1. The arrival of a high speed solar wind stream at\nthe dayside magnetopause induces a sharp enhancement in\nmagnetospheric convection. The convection onset is at the\nstream interface.\n[31] 2. Hot superdense plasma sheet ions and electrons\nare detected at geosynchronous orbit for \u000120 h following\nconvection onset. There follows an extended period when\nexceptionally hot plasma sheet ions and electrons, of more\nusual density, are continually convected to the inner mag-\nnetosphere, an environment that persists at geosynchronous\norbit while fast solar wind prevails.\n[32] 3. Drainage plumes have sunward flow speeds of 8\u2013\n12 km s\u00021 following the arrival of high speed solar wind\nstreams at the magnetopause.\n[33] 4. The density of plume material following calm\nperiods (Kp \u0001 0) is around double that following periods\nwhen low levels of convection persist (Kp \u0001 2).\n[34] 5. Sunward-directed hot-ion flows are seen in the\ndawn and dusk sectors during HSS-driven storms.\n[35] 6. Enhanced solar wind density is observed to\nprecede the superdense plasma sheet by \u00014 h.\n[36] Acknowledgments.
