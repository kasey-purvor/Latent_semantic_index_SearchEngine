Carter \nEngineering Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YR, UK \nPhone: +44 1524 593086, FAX +44 1524 594207, e.mail: r.carter@lancaster.ac.uk \nThe computer simulation of helix travelling-wave tubes requires accurate information about the \nphase velocity, interaction impedance and attenuation of the helix slow wave structure at each \nfrequency. This has received considerable attention, from the pioneering work of Pierce \nonwards, and it is possible to compute or measure the phase velocity with sufficient accuracy. \nThe methods available for determining the interaction impedance, however, cannot yet give \ngood enough results and there are appreciable differences between the figures given by \ndifferent methods. The purpose of this paper is to review the assumptions and approximations \nwhich are made in each case with a view to finding ways of achieving agreement between \nthem. \nThere are, essentially, three ways to determine the properties of a helix slow-wave structure \nwhose dimensions are known: mathematical analysis, computer simulation and experiment. \nThis paper is restricted to structures with tape helices supported by dielectric rods in a \ncylindrical conducting shell. \nMathematical analysis: is difficult because the helical structure does not readily fit any simple \nco-ordinate system. The most recent publication is that by D'Agostino et al. [ l ]. The method \nassumes continuity of the tangential electric field on the surface of the helix and that the tape \nis perfectly conducting in the winding direction. Good convergence of the results was obtained \nby including at least 5 space harmonics and using at least 30 concentric dielectric regions to \nmodel the support rods. The use of an effective relative permittivity for each dielectric region \neffectively assumes that the tangential component of the electric field is zero. When compared \nwith experimental results the method showed accuracies of lo%, 15% and 25% for three \ndifferent structures. The details of the experimental method were not given and this makes it \nimpossible to know the absolute accuracy of the theory. The author and his colleagues have \nobtained agreement better than 10% between computations using a method based on that \ndescribed by Sinha et al. [2] and careful experimental measurements incorporating corrections \nfor space harmonics, finite perturbing rod diameter and transverse field components. \nNumerical Analysis: has been reported by Ward et al [3] and by Kory and Dayton [4]. All \nnumerical analysis relies on discretisation of the structure to be analysed and very large \nnumbers of elements must be used to obtain good accuracy. In these methods polar meshes \nhave been used which are not an ideal fit to the boundaries of the helix or the support rods. \nThe helix must, therefore, be represented by a staircase of elements. This could, presumably \nbe avoided by using a finite element method with trapezoidal elements but that has not yet \nbeen reported. All numerical methods suffer from the difficulty of modelling the electric fields \naccurately close to the corners of the tape. This can lead to appreciable errors in the \ncomputation of the power flow in the structure and, hence, in the interaction impedance. Kory \nand Dayton reported agreement with experimental results to within 15% for a structure without \ndispersion shaping. The details of the experimental method were not given. \nExperiment The most accurate experimental methods are those described by Lagerstrom [5] \nwhich employ perturbation of the waves propagating on the helix using dielectric or metal rods \nplaced along the axis. It is difficult to make accurate experimental measurements on many \npractical slow-wave structures because of their small sizes and careful attention must be paid \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Lagerstrom recognised that it is necessary to make corrections \nfor the finite size of the perturbing rod and for space harmonic and transverse fields. The \nauthor and his colleagues have made careful experimental measurements on a wide range of \nhelical slow-wave structures [6]. These have shown that errors of up to 50% can be introduced \nif these corrections are not made. The correction for the effect of transverse fields was \nnegligible for a dielectric rod but could be as high as 20% for a metal rod. The repeatability of \nthe experimental results was better than 4%. The theory for the correction for the finite size of \nthe rod assumed that the fields outside the rod were unchanged by it. The author has shown in \nunpublished work that this assumption is not valid for the perturbation of a cavity resonator by \na dielectric rod and it is likely that the same is true in this case and may lead to errors of up to \n10%. \nIn order to be able to determine the interaction impedance of a helix slow-wave structure with \nconfidence we require agreement between at least two, and preferably all three, of the \nmethods described above. At present this has not been achieved to better than around 20% \npartly because the details of the experimental methods, and therefore their accuracies, have \nnot been reported. An added complication is the effect of any uncertainty in the values of the \nrelative permittivities of the support rods and of the perturbing rods used in experimental \nmeasurements. Recent work by the author has cast doubt on the accuracy of the use of cavity \nperturbation measurements to obtain this information. This paper will report comparisons \nbetween all three methods which will show the extent of the agreement between them when \nthe details of all methods are known. \nReferences \n[ l ]  S.
