The aim of\nthese interviews was to discuss the TQM initiatives and, in particular, to gauge the\ndegree and nature of the management commitment required to make these successful.\nWhat emerged was an indication of the emphasis that managers must place on\nbecoming personally involved if TQM is to be successful. Four common dimensions\nof management commitment were identified in the approaches seen across the six\nfactories. These were the time and effort invested, emphasis on clear goals and\norganisations, management\u2019s manufacturing expertise, and a strong focus on\nemployees (training and team work). Although this study is based only on six case\nstudies, the topic of commitment is an important one with significant implications for\nmanagement. It is also an area which is ripe for further, detailed investigation.\nKeywords\nUK manufacturing industry, management commitment to TQM\nINTRODUCTION\ncommitment n committing; obligation or pledge,\nstate of being involved Oxford English Dictionary\nOpen almost any management book on quality and you\u2019ll find lists of the pre-\nrequisites for successful TQM. One of the items always listed is \u201cmanagement\ncommitment\u201d. But what does this mean in the context of quality and isn\u2019t it simply \u201ca\ngiven\u201d that management will be committed?\nTo investigate management commitment, the authors visited six award\nwinning factories. These factories won the 1994 Best Factory Awards from\nManagement Today - Cranfield School of Management, as part of the annual\nprogramme which publicly recognises and rewards manufacturing excellence in the\nUK. Although a factory does not necessarily have to use TQM to stand a chance of\nwinning, all of the winners considered TQM as an important element in helping them\nachieve manufacturing excellence. Consequently, these top factories made ideal\nsubjects for an investigation of management involvement in TQM. What emerged is\n2that winning companies clearly do not treat management commitment as \u201ca given\u201d; on\nthe contrary, management take quality very seriously.\nTQM and MANAGEMENT COMMITMENT\nTQM literature is rife with statements about the importance of management\ncommitment. Examples are: \u201cTop management commitment is recognised by all\nquality \u2019gurus\u2019 as being an essential precondition for the success of quality\nmanagement\u201d [1] and; \u201chaving recognised the need for Quality Improvement, the first\nobjective is to secure management commitment\u201d [2]. The focus on commitment can\nbe traced to Crosby (his first step to quality improvement is \u201cmanagement\ncommitment\u201d) and Deming.\nJust as various authors have stressed the importance of management\ncommitment to the success of TQM, others investigating TQM failures have cited lack\nof commitment as a root cause (e.g. [3]). A study of British management found that\n18% of respondents saw lack of commitment as the cause of \u201cmajor difficulty\u201d [1]. A\nsurvey of European manufacturers showed many companies were using TQM\nsuperficially because of \u201ca lack of management commitment\u201d [4]. Other studies\nlooking at TQM in, for instance, R&D [5] and self-directed work teams [6] firmly\nidentified lack of commitment as a major reason for failure.\nAlthough recognition of management commitment is universal, few have tried\nto identify its essential components. One key paper, from Saraph et al [7] found that\nthe most important aspects of commitment to be:-\n\uf0b7 Participation of top management in quality programmes\n\uf0b7 Specific quality goals\n\uf0b7 Importance attached to quality in relation to costs and schedules\n\uf0b7 Comprehensive quality planning\nA recent paper in this magazine stated \u201cmanagement commitment is vital, but what\nexactly does this involve?\u201d [8] and went on to suggest that active management\ninvolvement, willingness to implement change and a high priority for quality are all\nessential elements.\nThe authors decided to investigate whether the above, or similar components\nof commitment were present at six top UK factories.\nBACKGROUND - THE BEST FACTORY AWARDS\nThe Best Factory Awards (BFA) programme not only recognises manufacturing\nexcellence but also collects detailed information from industry for research and\nbenchmarking purposes [9]. The awards are open to any UK manufacturer; factories\nmust complete a detailed, confidential questionnaire covering, for example,\nperformance data (e.g. delivery reliability) and management policy. Questionnaires are\nanalysed and this results in a short-list of plants with high levels of performance,\ncompared to the \u201cnorms\u201d of their industry. A panel of judges visits short-listed\ncompanies and, in a day spent interviewing staff, verifies the performance data, probes\nthe manufacturing strategy and checks on issues such as quality management. Each\nyear six factories are awarded prizes; the selection process has been described in detail\npreviously [9].\n3LESSONS FROM THE 1994 WINNERS\nThe BFA winning factories cover a wide range of markets and products - from, for\nexample, doughnuts (Kitchen Range), to gearbox castings (Ryobi). Table 1 gives a\nbrief description of each company and lists some of the key quality achievements.\nTable 1: The Management Today1 - Cranfield School of Management 1994 Best\nFactory Award Winners.\nCase\nStudy\nCompany Type of Company \/ Sector Examples of Results Achieved\n1 European\nComponents,\nBelfast, Northern\nIreland\nManufacturer of seat belt\nassemblies for motor vehicles \/ 600\nemployees \/ Japanese owned\nCell manufacturing and team work led to:-\n-13% labour cost reduction\n-50% floor space reduction\n-36% quality improvement resulting from\npoka yoke\n2 Ryobi,\nCarrickfergus,\nNorthern Ireland\nAluminium die casting of car\ngearboxes \/ 45 employees \/\nJapanese owned\n- Kaizen allowed the nominal capacity of\nthe plant of 600 castings per shift to be\nincreased to 940\n- Quality levels which set a standard for the\nindustry\n3 Kitchen Range,\nPeterborough\nManufacture of doughnuts and fruit\npies \/ 100 employees \/ UK owned\n- Preventive maintenance yields a\ndowntime of only 3%\n- Investment in the line was intended to\nincrease capacity by 35%, kaizen increased\nthis to 50%\n4 Glaxo, Barnard\nCastle, County\nDurham\nPackaging of pharmaceuticals \/ 500\nemployees \/ UK owned\n-Productivity increased by 50%\n-Waste decreased by 50%\n-On-time shipments from 15% to over 90%\n5 Dexter Nonwovens,\nChirnside,\nBerwickshire,\nScotland\nManufacture of specialised papers \/\n250 employees \/ US owned\n-Lead times from 12 weeks in 1989 to 3\nweeks today\n-Output is now 2\u00bd times the original\nsupposed capacity\n-Waste has been reduced from 8.5% to 6%\n-Line downtime has decreased from 7.5%\nto 2.3%\n6 Design to\nDistribution,\nKidsgrove,\nStaffordshire\nJIT supply of high-volume printed\ncircuit boards \/ 605 employees \/ UK\nowned\n- Lead times cut from 40 days to less than 5\ndays\n- High volume PCB\u2019s produced in an\nelapsed time of between 1 and 2 hours, i.e.\nstart of the process to despatch to customer\n- On-time delivery 100% of the time\n1 Management Today is a widely-read UK monthly management magazine.\nWith such a wide range of industries, it might seem surprising that there are close\nsimilarities in the way management at these companies approach quality. However,\nthere are common threads that run throughout the success stories of the six plants.\nSome of these are quantifiable, like the number and type of quality techniques used.\nOthers, however, are qualitative - for instance the enthusiasm for quality at the\nwinning factories. This could \u201cbe felt\u201d; it came over strongly in discussions with not\nonly management but also with production staff. Identifying the success factors in\nquality implementation is not an exact science. However, the authors attempted to\nanswer the question \u201cWhat is it about management commitment at these organisations\nthat allowed them to achieve such impressive quality results?\u201d\nMany companies focus on techniques when they try to implement TQM.\nAlthough all of the winning companies use quality techniques, there is much more to\nsuccessful TQM than this. In fact, observations and interviews identified four key\naspects which led to successful TQM at the winning companies (Figure 1). These\n4were the time and effort invested by management, whether clear goals and\norganisations were introduced, a passion for optimising production processes and a\nfocus on staff (training and team-work). Each of these will be discussed and examples\ngiven.\n1) Commitment = Time, Effort and Enthusiasm\nThe first common factor identified across the winning factories was the amount of\nmanagement time, effort and enthusiasm invested in quality matters. The ability to\ndelegate is obviously a vital management skill but it appears that in the case of quality,\ndelegation is probably not the right approach. It takes time and persistence to\novercome inertia, as shown by the experiences of the pharmaceutical company Glaxo\nat Barnard Castle, County Durham.\nGlaxo had a very long struggle to persuade employees that continuous\nimprovement programmes were really necessary. The company had been successful\nfor many years in the pharmaceuticals market, largely through their R&D strength.\nAnd quality levels were already high. \u201cThis made it hard to convince people that big\nimprovements were necessary - in a profitable and growing market, cost reduction is\nnot seen as a high priority\u201d says manufacturing manager Ian McCubbin. However, Ian\nand his management team recognised that their market was becoming increasingly\ncompetitive and so, between 1987 and 1992, they launched four major quality\ninitiatives. Some companies might have given up after one initiative and before any\nreal results were achieved. However, management had set their sights high and so they\npersisted. Two sets of circumstances helped in achieving the essential level of\nawareness. Firstly, a new manager organised visits to other factories. Seeing the\nachievements of other factories galvanised Glaxo and the everyone became conscious\nof the need for higher quality. The second catalyst was management\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d of\nGoldratt\u2019s \u201cclassic\u201d book The Goal. Soon everyone was reading the fast-moving story\nof a manufacturing manager struggling against the odds to save his factory. Copies\nwere made available to production employees and they eagerly read it. Subsequent\nkaizen projects have had 100% involvement of all employees. And this brought results\n- examples are 80% reduction in changeover times, 90% waste reduction and 50%\nreduction in lead times. Ian McCubbin does not know how much time he invested\nover the last five years in implementing quality. However, he does think it was time\nwell spent.\nAt Dexter Nonwovens, a specialist paper manufacturer in Chirnside Scotland,\nquality required continuous management effort \u201cover the last twelve years\u201d, says Ian\nKenworthy, Quality Planning Manager. In 1983-6 the US parent company introduced\nTQM in response to increasing competition and the Chirnside plant followed suit in\n1986 - Ian was sent to be trained on techniques such as kaizen and the work of\nDeming and Juran. He came back convinced of the value of TQM and trained all of\nFigure 1:\nManagement Commitment: Factors for Successful TQM at the Six Case Studies\n1) Time, Effort and Enthusiasm\n2) Clear Goals, Organisations and Communications\n3) A Passion for the Production Process\n4) A Strong Focus on Staff (Training and Team-work)\n5his colleagues (everyone was trained: people from production, management and\nadministration, including secretaries). The training marked the start of what has\nbecome a tradition at Dexter - significant quality improvements on a regular, never\nending basis. (And Dexter have graphs going back to 1984 to prove it!) Management\u2019s\nconstant focus on quality has led to impressive results, such as a reduction in lead time\nfor specialised papers from 12 to 3 weeks. Even today General Manager Bill Paton is\nconvinced that allocating time to quality is essential, saying \u201cNormally it is the law of\ndiminishing returns - but its not been so with us, we\u2019re still obtaining good results\u201d.\nThe examples demonstrate the effort required from management in\nsuccessfully implementing TQM. This was the same at all the winning factories. And\none thing is clear, when management shows its enthusiasm, this sends the clearest\npossible signal to staff on the importance of quality.\n2) Commitment = Clear Goals, Organisations and Communications\nQuality initiatives often fail because goals are unclear, or there are barriers inherent in\na company\u2019s organisational structure. Not so at the winning companies. They ensure\neveryone understands the goals and have, in some instances, made sweeping\norganisational changes to ensure nothing blocks progress.\nEuropean Components (ECC) in Belfast produce seat belt assemblies. They\nensure that goals, including quality goals, are understood and receive sufficient\nattention throughout the company. ECC use Hoshin-type management planning and\nreporting (Hoshin means visionary goal in Japanese), in which each of the strategies\nset by management is broken down into its components and responsibility assigned to\nthe appropriate departments. This guarantees that the relevant departments quickly\nfocus on goals from above. To some, this might sound like everything is decided at\nthe top. Not so, ECC encourage their line employees to set their own priorities for\nquality improvements. Consequently, ideas from both above and below converge to\nform a comprehensive quality policy. Organisational boundaries have also been\naddressed. For example, the responsibility for line maintenance was moved to the\nmanufacturing cells. Cell teams now perform their own preventive maintenance and\nseldom need specialist support. ECC have put responsibilities where they belong and\nthis has produced excellent results.\nClear management decisions, assigning responsibilities where they belong,\nwere seen at all of the winning factories. For instance quality responsibility at Kitchen\nRange in Peterborough, manufacturer of doughnuts and fruit pies, lies with the line\noperators themselves. They call on support staff for the more complicated tests as\nneed be. In addition, management have made sure that everyone knows the customer\u2019s\n- McDonalds Restaurants\u2019 - stringent quality requirements. Operators have the\nresponsibility for the end-product and, if necessary, reject doughnuts that are not\nperfect (including rejection on purely aesthetic grounds). The quality requirements of\nthe customer are not only clear to staff at Kitchen Range, but also are made clear to\nsuppliers. For instance the quality of fruit used in pies is tightly specified and no\nvariations are acceptable because they impact the end-product. Consistency in the\ntexture (\u201cchunkiness\u201d) and taste of pie fillings is critical to McDonalds. This imposes\na significant discipline on Kitchen Range and, in turn, their suppliers. Meeting these\ngoals can be difficult and \u201cquite a lot of cultural change was required at one of our\nsuppliers [to meet these goals]\u201d explains Kitchen Range\u2019s Managing Director Simon\nLebus.\n6The examples show the importance of clear goals. Goals that are clearly\ncommunicated and assigned to an organisation whose structure supports rather than\nhinders their achievement.\n3) Commitment = A Passion for the Production Process\nWhat makes a production process efficient? Which factors influence quality, costs and\nreproducibility? Must there be trade-offs? All of the winning companies have top\nmanagers who are passionately interested in these questions and have the drive to\nanswer them. Management commitment must be built on a clear understanding of\nTQM [3] but, in a manufacturing scenario, it appears that managers who understand\nthe technical details of processes also play a key role.\nRyobi\u2019s knowledge of their aluminium casting process demonstrates their\nattention to (manufacturing) detail. They mix a carefully measured amount of flux into\nthe molten aluminium before casting gearbox housings. Many manufacturers do not\nuse flux but Ryobi insist that it leads to higher quality and have detailed figures to\nprove it. So exact is their knowledge of the process that they can recognise when the\nquality of the purchased flux is insufficient. Locally purchased flux of the same\nspecifications as that used in Japan gave sub-optimal results as revealed by monitored\nprocess variables. Investigation revealed that the flux was not exactly as specified. and\nso shipments of flux from Japan were organised, until the supplier solved the problem.\nAttention to detail has also helped Ryobi reach a quality level unmatched in the\nindustry. One of the problems with poor gearbox castings is that, after machining, they\nmay be porous to oil. Traditionally, car manufacturers who found porous castings\nsealed the castings\u2019 surfaces with chemicals and simply charged their suppliers for the\ncost of this treatment. However, Ryobi rejected this industry \u201cnorm\u201d (where defects\nwere never analysed) and defect castings are returned for a thorough analysis. Now\nthrough Ryobi\u2019s unique understanding of their process, very few defects occur - so\nfew that it is a closely guarded figure that Ryobi do not share.\nDesign to Distribution in Kidsgrove (normally known as D2D) manufacture\nprinted circuit boards (PCBs). Their managers thoroughly understand their production\nprocess. Through monitoring a wide range of process variables, they have developed a\nmodel which enables them to predict the reliability that a customer\u2019s design for a PCB\nwill yield. Using this model they actively advise customers how to improve a design\nand how to reduce manufacturing costs in both the short and long-term. \u201cAll our\ncustomers want to see continuous cost reduction. They want to see a forward plan, and\nthey want to know in advance what\u2019s going to come out of the costs - and when.\u201d says\nJeff Sharrock, the plant\u2019s General Manager. The model is powerful enough to do this,\nto a degree of accuracy that wins customer loyalty.\nThe winning plants have managers who understand their manufacturing\nprocesses intimately. They do not see processes as fixed, instead they see constant\nopportunities for improvement.\n4) Commitment = Strong Focus on Staff (Training and Team Work)\nIt is a simple fact. Even if you recruit good people, if you do not develop their skills\nfurther then sooner, rather than later, you will have a problem. All of the winners\ncontinuously invest in training their staff. Awareness visits for staff to the US or Japan\n7were seen as good investments, despite the costs involved. Benchmarking visits were\nseen as essential, as was having line employees meet customers. One of the most\nintriguing points from the top factories was how training had led to a high degree of\nteam-work and enthusiasm for quality. Investment in staff training has paid a dividend\nfor the winners - the key to their success is their people. It reminds the authors of the\nslogan seen in many of the factories of a top US computer manufacturer, known for its\nhigh quality \u201cSystems make it possible but people make it happen\u201d.\nManagement at D2D perceive their continued success in a competitive market\nas critically dependent on the ability to learn faster than competitors. Consequently\nemployees continuously need to learn new skills; on-the-job experience, learning from\ncolleagues and actively seeking new knowledge are all aspects promoted in D2D\u2019s\ntraining philosophy. Each employee has a learning plan which is not simply a piece of\npaper written once and read never - at D2D it is a \u201cliving\u201d document that is treated\nseriously and implemented.\nThe winning companies did not simply take \u201coff the shelf\u201d quality seminars.\nNo, seminars were specifically tailored to fit the goals of the initiative. At European\nComponents, management was directly involved in designing the 4 day quality\nseminar. Training Manager Christine McGowan, ensured a pragmatic approach -\nemployees chose actual problems which they wanted to solve using TQM methods.\nChristine attended all of the seminars and personally helps with kaizen projects. This\napproach led to quick \u201cbuy-in\u201d from line employees and generated much enthusiasm.\nThe value of this is seen in the energy staff put into applying one of the techniques\ncovered in the training - poka yoke (Japanese for fail-safe). This technique is used to\ndesign manufacturing processes which prevent the possibility of mistakes and is an\nimportant consideration when producing complicated safety equipment like seat belts.\nEmployees are now very adept at poka yoke and proudly tell visitors that quality levels\nare up 36% and that some of their ideas have been adopted in the Japanese parent\nplant.\nOne manager interviewed on team work was Hiroshi Urabe, a Japanese\nmanufacturing manager at Ryobi, He is one of the world\u2019s experts on aluminium\ncasting and some might think that such a specialist would only listen to the ideas of\nother experts. No, it is quite the contrary because Urabe-san really values the ideas\nthat emerge from the team meetings saying, \u201cEverybody has a good idea in his mind\u201d.\nConclusions\nMuch emphasis has been placed on the importance of management commitment in\nsuccessful TQM. This study gives preliminary ideas of four key areas where\nmanagement should concentrate with manufacturing TQM initiatives. Since many\nTQM programmes fail due to lack of commitment, the implication is that management\nshould identify how they will address each of these four key areas before they start.\nThree factors are similar to those identified by other researchers [7] but one - the\ntechnical expertise in manufacturing shown by management - is new. Further research\ncould focus on this area and give managers an even clearer indication of the practical\nsteps they need to take to demonstrate commitment.\nAnd how long is commitment required? The last word from the winning\nfactories goes to Ian McCubbin from Glaxo. When asked whether, now that high\nquality has been achieved, he would reduce the amount of time he spends on quality\nissues, he replied; \u201cNo, because the moment we think that we\u2019ve got it finally licked,\nthat\u2019s the moment that we\u2019ll lose it - you can never take your foot off the accelerator\u201d.\n8Further Reading\nThe UK\u2019s Department of Trade and Industry has published detailed case studies on\nthe winning factories.
