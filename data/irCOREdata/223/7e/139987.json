Introduction\nNano-particulate suspensions or \u2018nanofluids\u2019 illustrate a classical conundrum whereby\nthe continuum properties are often readily measurable (in terms of the across and\nthrough variables) and hence macroscopic behaviour can be modelled adequately for\nengineering purposes, but afterwards there remains a doubt that part of the story\nremains untold and a real technological breakthrough is only one step away.\nResearchers have sometimes found that very small volume fractions of nanoparticles\nsuspended in a carrier fluid can produce quite remarkable increases in macroscopic\nproperties, such as thermal conductivity. This cannot be easily dismissed. If these\nimprovements could be stabilised at the higher end of expectations then the\ntechnological benefits could indeed be huge. However, when the experiments are\nrepeated under ostensibly the same conditions, the results can sometimes be less\nencouraging than previously observed. One explanation could be that nanofluids are\ninherently unstable. Generally speaking, nanoparticles tend to cluster and agglomerate\nif they are not prevented from doing so. This leads to uncertainties in the effective\nparticle size, particle shape, particle numbers and inter-particle spacing. For thermo-\nfluids, it is easy to conceive that synergies existing between the particles and the\ncarrier fluid can be overshadowed when particle agglomeration occurs; causing the\nsystem to change its characteristics and, in effect, reverting to one with fewer, larger\nparticles. In this scenario the macroscopic fluid properties can be described broadly by\neffective-medium theories [1-5]. However this does not mean that synergistic effects\nbetween the particles and fluid do not exist, rather that they may be length-scale\nsensitive and they can become obscured by randomisation. For the case of fluids that\nexhibit the giant electro-rheological effect, mathematical models based only on the\nvolume fractions and the physical properties of the individual phases, do not\nadequately describe the overall behaviour [6-9]. Here the free energy of the system\nhas an electrical component, due to the applied electric field, that dominates over the\nrandomising effects of thermal motion and there is a true synergistic effect. However,\nthe physical explanation for this is not complete and the influence of the imaginary\ncomponent of the dielectric permittivity is at present unclear. In the following study\nwe demonstrate that the DC electrical conductivity of low volume-fraction nano-\nparticulate suspensions in silicone and perfluorinated oils is enhanced even at very\nmoderate electric field strengths and this effect is related intrinsically to the fluid-\nparticle combinations. The experiments are designed to reveal trends by comparison\nand the findings do not rely on knowledge of the nanoparticles electrical properties.\n2. Experimental Procedure\nThe DC electrical conductivities of six different nanofluid systems, (representing\ncombinations of three different nano-particle types and two different carrier fluids),\nwere measured experimentally. The nanoparticles were an electrical conductor (nickel\n- Ni), an electro-active ceramic (barium titanate - BT) and iron oxide (magnetite \u2013\nwhich is one part w\u00fcstite FeO and one part haematite Fe2O3 - FO). All of these were\nsynthesised in our laboratory, BT by hydrothermal synthesis, Ni and FO by wet\nchemical synthesis [10]. In all cases a narrow particle size distribution was achieved.\nThe base fluids were silicone oil (Dow Corning 200\/50cS) and a perfluorinated oil\n(3M\u2122 Fluorinert FC70) which have almost the same electrical conductivity and\nsimilar relative permittivity, but which differ both in viscosity and specific gravity.\nPhysical quantities for the fluids are listed in Table 1. Figures given in Table 1 for the\nnanoparticles are based on the mean particle size, which is the only measured quantity\n(derived from SEM image analysis). Hence the inter-particle spacing of particles is a\nnotional figure. It assumes a perfect dispersion in the fluid and it is provided only as\nan aid to visualisation of the scale of inter-particle spacing at different volume\nfractions. Note that the chosen range is from around 9 to 3.5 particle diameters.\nTheory suggests that the inter-particle distances in these suspensions may be too large\nfor multi-polar interactions to dominate the electrical behaviour [11]. However, in a\npractical context it is assumed that this may be a factor.\nParticles were dispersed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes. The concentration sets\nwere 2g\/l, 4g\/l, 10g\/l, 20g\/l and 30g\/l. The systematic weighing error in all cases was\n<0.001%. Volume fractions are calculated for each suspension using the bulk\ndensities of the materials. DC current measurements were carried out using a Keithley\n6517 electrometer for different applied voltages between 20V and 100V. The fluidic\nconductivity cell consisted of a 1mm gap between concentric copper electrodes and\nthe effective electrode area was 21.88cm2. The systematic error due to the\nmeasurement system was 0.05% at 20V and 0.01% at 100V. The current versus time\nprofile showed a transient peak, due to capacitance, between 1-2 seconds after\napplication of the voltage. Readings were therefore taken after 20 seconds\nrepresenting the steady-state values. Measurements were carried out at 295K and the\ncell was dried scrupulously in nitrogen between measurements to exclude moisture.\nAll of the experiments were subsequently duplicated in order to confirm that the\nmeasurements represented a true record of systematic behaviour.\nTable 1 \u2013 Physical quantities of the nanoparticles (nickel - Ni, barium titanate - BT\nand magnetite - FO) and two base fluids\nInter-particle spacing (notional) \u2013 (nm)Mean\nparticle\ndiameter\n(nm)\nBulk\ndensity\n(kg\/m3)\nParticle\nnumber\ndensity\n(m-3)\n@ Vol. fraction (%)\n0.05 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.6\nNi 90 8800 2.62E21 824 635 486 367 309\nBT 130 5850 8.69E20 1190 918 702 530 447\nFO 10 5240 1.91E24 92 71 54 41 34\nManufacturers Data Viscosity(mPas)\nRelative\npermittivity\nSpecific\ngravity\nConductivity @\n1kV\/m (Sm-1)\n200\/50cS silicone oil 50 2.60 0.973 10E-12\n3M\u2122 Fluorinert FC70 14 1.98 1.940 10E-12\n1.E-13\n1.E-12\n1.E-11\n1.E-10\n1.E-09\n1.E-08\n10 40 70 100 130\nE [V\/mm]\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nct\niv\nit\ny\n[S\n\/m\n]\n30g\/l FO\nvf 0.573%\n20g\/l FO\nvf 0.382%\n10g\/l FO\nvf 0.191%\n4g\/l FO\nvf 0.076%\n2g\/l FO\nvf 0.038%\nBase fluid\nSilicone oil\nA - Iron oxide nano-particles\n1.E-13\n1.E-12\n1.E-11\n1.E-10\n1.E-09\n1.E-08\n10 40 70 100\nE [V\/mm]\nFluorinert FC70\nA\n1.E-13\n1.E-12\n1.E-11\n1.E-10\n1.E-09\n1.E-08\n10 40 70 100 130\nE [V\/mm]\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nct\niv\nty\n[S\n\/m\n]\n30g\/l BT\nvf 0.512%\n20g\/l BT\nvf 0.341%\n10g\/l BT\nvf 0.171%\n4g\/l BT\nvf 0.068%\n2g\/l BT\nvf 0.034%\nBase fluid\nSilicone oil\nB\n1.E-13\n1.E-12\n1.E-11\n1.E-10\n1.E-09\n1.E-08\n10 40 70 100\nE [V\/mm]\nB - Barium titanate nano-particles\nFluorinert FC70\n1.E-13\n1.E-11\n1.E-09\n1.E-07\n1.E-05\n1.E-03\n1.E-01\n10 40 70 100 130\nE [V\/mm]\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nct\niv\nit\ny\n[S\n\/m\n]\n30g\/l Ni\nvf 0.341%\n20g\/l Ni\nvf 0.227%\n10g\/l Ni\nvf 0.114%\n4g\/l Ni\nvf 0.046%\n2g\/l Ni\nvf 0.023%\nBase fluid\nSilicone oil\nC\n1.E-13\n1.E-12\n1.E-11\n1.E-10\n1.E-09\n1.E-08\n10 40 70 100\nE [V\/mm]\nC - Nickel nano-particles\nFluorinert FC70\nFigure 1: DC conductivities of three types of nanoparticles in two different insulating\nfluids: silicone oil (left side) and 3M\u2122 Fluorinert FC70 (right side).

Results and Discussion\nFigure 1 shows DC conductivities for the six different nanoparticle-fluid\ncombinations measured for different particle loadings and under moderate electric\nfield conditions. When considering the results it is useful to take the following\ncorrelations into account: i) The barium titanate particles and the iron oxide particles\nhave quite similar bulk densities, but their sizes are very different and their effective\nelectrical conductivities at the nano-scale are uncertain; ii) The nickel particles and\nthe barium titanate particles have very similar masses (BT larger particles, Ni higher\ndensity), but the materials have very different electrical properties (high dielectric\npermittivities, but contrasting electrical conductivities); iii) The iron oxide and the\nnickel particles both have some magnetic character, but they are very different in size\nand mass; iv) The two fluids have almost the same (very low) electrical conductivity;\nv) The viscosity of the silicone oil is higher than that of the FC70 and its specific\ngravity is around half; vi) The dielectric permittivity of the silicone oil is a little\nhigher than that of the Fluorinert FC70; for particles of the same type, the effect this\nhas on the real part of the complex Clausius-Mossotti value is therefore estimated in\nthe ratio of ~ 11:10 [1,12]. By consideration of the applied electric field threshold for\nparticle agglomeration [13] and using the \u2018non-equilibrium phase diagram of\nstructures\u2019 approach adopted by Melrose [14], it can be said that, in all cases, the\ninter-particle forces due to polarisation are estimated by calculation to be much too\nsmall for any polarisation-induced aggregation of particles to occur.\nIn Figure 1 (top row) it can be seen that the silicone oil base fluid has some field-\ndependent character over the observed range, shown as an increase in measured\nconductivity as the applied voltage is increased; but this is not the only effect\nobserved. The conductivity of iron-oxide particles in FC70 is higher than it is in the\nsilicone oil. There is evidence of field-induced behaviour in silicone oil at all\nconcentrations and particularly at 10g\/l. At 10g\/l in FC70 an increase is also observed\nand this occurs at a lower applied field; repeated experiments have confirmed that this\nis a consistent occurrence. More detailed analysis shows that the observed increases\nfollow the relationship: EJ \uf0b5ln (where J is the current density and E the applied\nelectric field) characteristic of energy-activated, Poole-Frenkel type behaviour\n[15,16].\nThe barium titanate suspensions, in contrast, exhibit an opposite tendency; they have\nhigher conductivities in silicone oil than in FC70. In FC70 both nickel and barium\ntitanate show very modest increases with increasing particle concentration. Note that\n20g\/l BT and 30g\/l Ni have similar volume fractions of particles. Some small\nincreases are observable at low concentrations for both materials, however the overall\nflat response would suggest that there is no significant Hall-effect contribution,\nalthough this may have been expected.\nThe DC conductivity of the nickel nanoparticles in silicone oil shows an exceptionally\nhigh increase even at very low volume fractions (~0.05%). Note that the peak\nconductivity measured here is more than six orders of magnitude greater than for the\niron oxide and barium titanate suspensions. When this nanoparticle-fluid combination\nwas repeated the trends remained the same, however, the measured values are not\nconsistent. Under the same experimental conditions the DC conductivity value at\n30g\/l nickel in silicone oil has also been measured at 1E-4 S\/m (20g\/l, 8E-6 S\/m,\n10g\/l, 8E-8 S\/m). This range of variability is not present in any of the other particle\nfluid combinations; the nickel-FC70 combination provides consistent repeatable\nvalues at all concentrations. Given the experimental conditions it is concluded that the\nobserved instability is a consequence of a difference in the spatial distribution of the\nparticles. It is known that particle chains are able to grow from asperities [17-19] with\nconcomitant changes to the local electric field distribution. Electrohydrodynamic\nforces also pertain [20-22].\n1.E-13\n1.E-11\n1.E-09\n1.E-07\n1.E-05\n10 40 70 100 130\nE [V\/mm]\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nct\niv\nit\ny\n[S\n\/m\n]\n20g\/l\nvf Ni 0.114%\nvf FO 0.191%\n10g\/l\nvf Ni 0.057%\nvf FO 0.096%\nBase fluid\n1Ni + 1FO (by weight)\nSilicone oil 1.E-13\n1.E-11\n1.E-09\n1.E-07\n1.E-05\n10 40 70 100\nE [V\/mm]\n1Ni + 1FO (by weight)\nFluorinert FC70\n1.E-13\n1.E-11\n1.E-09\n1.E-07\n1.E-05\n10 40 70 100 130\nE [V\/mm]\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nct\niv\nit\ny\n[S\n\/m\n]\n20g\/l\nvf Ni 0.171%\nvf FO 0.096%\n10g\/l\nvf Ni 0.085%\nvf FO 0.048%\nBase fluid\nSilicone oil\n3Ni + 1FO (by weight)\n1.E-13\n1.E-11\n1.E-09\n1.E-07\n1.E-05\n10 40 70 100\nE [V\/mm]\n3Ni + 1FO (by weight)\nFluorinert FC70\n1.E-13\n1.E-11\n1.E-09\n1.E-07\n1.E-05\n10 40 70 100 130\nE [V\/mm]\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nct\niv\nit\ny\n[S\n\/m\n]\n20g\/l\nvf Ni 0.205%\nvf FO 0.038%\n10g\/l\nvf Ni 0.103%\nvf FO 0.019%\nBase fluid\nSilicone oil\n9Ni + 1FO (by weight)\n1.E-13\n1.E-11\n1.E-09\n1.E-07\n1.E-05\n10 40 70 100\nE [V\/mm]\n9Ni + 1FO (by weight)\nFluorinert FC70\nFigure 2: DC conductivities of suspensions containing both nickel (90nm diameter)\nand iron oxide (10nm diameter) nanoparticles - silicone oil (left side) and 3M\u2122\nFluorinert FC70 (right side). The particle combinations are nickel:iron oxide - top row\nin the ratio 1:1 by weight, middle row 3:1 by weight, bottom row 9:1 by weight.\nIn Figure 2 the DC conductivities of suspensions containing both nickel nanoparticles\nand iron oxide nanoparticles are shown over a range of volume fractions. The main\nfeatures to note are that in silicone oil the measurements correspond to what might be\nexpected from particle mixtures given the earlier results, with the nickel particles\nassuming a dominant role. In FC70 however the findings are more surprising, in that\nthe DC conductivity of the suspension varies very little when the proportions of nickel\nand iron oxide are varied over quite a wide range. For all combinations some field-\nactivated character has been introduced that was absent in the single particle-type\nsuspensions. Conductivities are higher than could be expected from either particle-\ntype acting alone and overall behaviour is, therefore, dependent on the particle\u2013fluid\ninteraction. Note that both types of particle have some magnetic character which may\npromote a Hall-effect contribution.\n4. Conclusion\nEffective medium theories based solely on the electrical properties and volume\nfractions of the component materials have limited applicability when assessing the DC\nconductivity of the above nanoparticle-fluid combinations at low volume fractions.\nEnhanced DC conductivity through interaction between the particles and the fluid has\nbeen demonstrated even at quite moderate fields and different types of nanoparticles\nhave been shown to exhibit different behavioural trends. Whilst the DC enhancement\nis partly related to the spatial arrangement of the particles as expected, there is clear\nevidence that energy-activated (electric-field activated) processes also play a major\nrole. The DC conductivity of a perfluorinated oil, 3M\u2122 Fluorinert FC70, is increased\nin the presence of 10nm diameter iron-oxide nanoparticles. Combinations of different\nspecies of nanoparticles appear to influence percolation, sometimes enhancing and\nsometimes moderating the observed systems behaviour. Synergies clearly do exist\nbetween nanoparticles and carrier fluids that can have a major influence on their\nsystems properties, hence they may be exploitable in the future development of\nengineering nanofluids.\nAcknowledgement\nZsuzsanna Libor would like to acknowledge the financial support of the UK\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under Platform Grant\nNo. EP\/D506638\/1 Nanoscale Multifunctional Ferroic Materials and Devices\n1.
