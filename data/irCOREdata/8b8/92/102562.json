A fear of \ninteracting with technology can therefore have a major impact on the quality of an \nindividual\u2019s life. This is particularly salient within education as an inability to \nmaximise the benefits of technology may limit academic achievement and subsequent \nopportunities in life. The severity of the anxiety induced by technology has lead to a \nplethora of research into the prevalence of \u2018technophobia\u2019. This term may have \nclinical relevance and has been found to be comparable in severity to more traditional \nphobias (Thorpe and Brosnan, 2001). This paper presents two studies examining the \neffect of clinically derived treatments upon levels of anxiety induced by technology. \nStudy one was a 10-week selective desensitisation programme with 16  participants (8 \ncomputer anxious, 8 non-anxious). Over this period computer anxiety and coping \ncognitions were significantly improved in the computer anxious group and  become \ncomparable to those of the matched non anxious controls. Study two was a single \ntreatment session for anxiety. 30 Individuals identified as anxious were assigned to \neither a one-session treatment (n=9) or non-treatment (n=21) group. Initially both \ngroups were significantly more anxious than the non anxious control group (n=59). \nSubsequent testing established that over the period of an academic year the reduction \nin anxiety was three times greater in the treated group than the non-treated group such \nthat by the end of the year the treated group no longer differed from the control group, \nwhereas the non-treated group remained significantly more anxious. The implications \nand limitations of the studies are discussed. \n   \n 3\n \n\u201cI believe I am absolutely, wildly, technophobic. Even when I \nhear people on the telephone telling me to do various things, I \ncannot do it. I cannot do my video. I have never used my cash \ncard in the bank and I do not know how to use a computer, I \nam absolutely terrified\u2026\u201d (C.V.). \n \n \nThe quote above came unprompted from a participant asked to take part in a study \nexamining technophobia in the twenty first century. Technophobia refers to a \nheightened level of anxiety induced by Information Technology (IT), typically \ncomputers, and can be defined as \u2018an irrational anticipation of fear evoked by the \nthought of using (or actually using) computers, the effects of which result in avoiding, \nor minimising, computer usage\u2019 (Brosnan, 1998a: 17). This definition draws upon a \nplethora of research that has identified significant levels of technophobia in virtually \nevery population tested such as the Police, Teachers, Office workers, College \nstudents, school children and the General Public (Bonzionelos, 1996; Brosnan and \nDavidson, 1996; Marcoulides, Mayers and Wiseman, 1995, Rosen and Weil, 1995, \nTodman and Dick, 1993; See also Brosnan, 1998a; Brosnan and Davidson, 1994; \nChua, Chen and Wong, 1999; Maurer, 1994; Rosen and Maguire, 1990; Whitely, \n1997). These studies, reviews and meta-analyses consistently report that around a \nthird of all those sampled report a heightened level of anxiety when faced with \ntechnology. In one of the larger studies of around 1,300 college students, Rosen, Sears \nand Weil (1993) report that 37% registered as technophobic. Within the technophobic \nsample, a far smaller proportion, typically around 13%, report far more aversive \nreactions to technology, such as sweaty palms and heart palpitations (Rosen et al., \n1993). This constitutes around 5% of the entire sample exhibiting classic signs of an \nanxiety reaction in the presence of IT. People experiencing this level of technophobia \nare comparable (i.e. not significantly different) in measures of anxiety and phobic \n 4\nbeliefs to those with spider phobia \u2013 both groups significantly differing from controls  \n(Thorpe and Brosnan, in press). In both cases, individuals may additionally express \nfear of coming to harm, of losing control or of panicking.  \n \nThere can be little doubt that the anxiety induced by technology constitutes \u2018a real \nphenomenon\u2019 (Moldafsky and Kwon, 1994: 302, see also Anthony, Clarke and \nAnderson, 2000; Bozionelos, 2001; Brosnan, 1998, Gurcan-Namlu and Ceyling, \n2003; Rosen and Maguire, 1990) the assessment of which demonstrates both \nreliability and validity (Chua et al., 1999; Dukes, Discenza and Couger, 1989). Whilst \nthe term technophobia has been used to describe those uncomfortable with and \nanxious about IT, not all of these individuals would be comparable to traditional \nclinically-defined phobias. The evidence above, however, suggests the possibility that \naround 1 in 20 may experience a level of technophobia that is comparable to the more \ntraditional clinically-defined phobias: a figure that has remained remarkably \nconsistent (Todman and Day, in press). \n \nThe research above suggests that there are a number of overlaps between \ntechnophobia and specific phobia as defined by DSM-IV (300.29). There are 7 \ndiagnostic criteria for a specific phobia (p.410-411). These are: (a) an excessive or \nunreasonable fear is cued by a specific object or situation; (b) exposure to the object \ninvariably provokes an immediate anxiety response; (c) the person recognises that the \nfear is unreasonable; (d) the phobic situation is avoided or endured whilst anxious; (e) \nthe avoidance or anxiety is distressing or interferes with the person\u2019s (academic, \noccupational, social) life; (f) the phobia is not better accounted for by another mental \ndisorder and finally for children (g) that the duration is at least 6 months. Although \nthe definition of technophobia (see above) was drawn by synthesising the literature on \n 5\ncomputer anxiety (see Brosnan, 1998 for a review) it clearly overlaps with these \ndiagnostic criteria, specifically a to e. Concerning criteria (f), it has also been \ndemonstrated that computer anxiety is independent of trait anxiety and does not \nrepresent an additional focus of anxiety for generally anxious individuals (or \nindividuals anxious about mathematics; see Rosen and Maguire, 1990 for a meta \nanalysis).  \n \nAge and ethnicity are not factors that affect technophobia, although as with spider \nphobia, females are over represented within the phobic groupings (see Rosen and \nMaguire, 1990 for a meta analysis). DSM-IV reports that up to 90% of those \nexperiencing specific phobias are female. This is consistent with the computer anxiety \nresearch (Brosnan and Davidson, 1994) which has given rise to the term \u2018The Digital \nDivide\u2019 to reflect the inequality of opportunity that has prevented some females from \nfully taking part in, and benefiting from, the technological revolution (Cooper and \nWeaver, 2003). The other major demographic variable of interest is the amount of \nexperience of computing. Those suffering from technophobia have less computer \nrelated experience than those who are not (Maurer, 1994; Rosen et al., 1993). As one \nof the consequences of technophobia is to avoid or minimise the amount of \nexperience gained, this is unsurprising. The relationship between experience and \nanxiety in the computer anxious is confounded by the fact that additional experience \nappears to exacerbate rather than reduce their technology-related anxiety: \u2018far from \ncuring their computerphobia, each additional computer experience strengthens their \nnegative affective reactions and promotes further computer avoidance\u2019 (Rosen and \nMaguire, 1990: 187).  The detrimental effects of computer-related experience for \n 6\npeople with technophobia and the similarity of technophobia to traditional phobias \nhas lead Rosen et al. (1993) to call for clinically based interventions. \n \nThe understanding of the topic has suffered to some extent from the misappropriation \nof Seligman\u2019s ideas about the place of phobic fear as an evolved adaptation.  \nAccording to Seligman, phobic fear 'is by definition not readily inhibited by rational \nmeans' and 'prepared conditioning is not readily modified by information' (Seligman \n1971: 316).   For a time, the idea became prevalent that only those stimuli relevant in \nour ancestral \/evolutionary past would become the object of phobic response - this led \nto misunderstanding of the importance of the cognitive element in the aetiology and \nmaintenance of specific phobias and to the restriction of investigation to common and \neasily understood (in terms of our hominid past) phobias such as spiders, snakes \nheights and thunderstorms.  In fact, almost any object can become the object of a \nphobia, including buttons, rhubarb leaves and the bottoms of boats (Thorpe and \nSalkovskis, 1995, 1997a), many of which defy a simple evolutionary explanation \u2013 as \nis the case with technophobia. Indeed, the role of negative cognitions associated with \ntechnophobia has been highlighted by several authors (Heinssen, Glass and Knight, \n1987; Smith and Caputi, 2001). \n \nDespite the plethora of research into technophobia, there is little research utilising \nclinically based interventions. A notable exception is the work of Rosen and Weil \n(Rosen et al., 1993; Weil et al., 1987) who developed a successful treatment \nprogramme based upon the traditional anxiety reduction technique of systematic \ndesensitisation (SD: Wolpe, 1958; 1982). Rosen et al.\u2019s (1993) findings suggested that \nan SD programme did reduce anxiety and that this effect was long-lasting, resulting in \n 7\nreduced drop out and higher grades at college. This is consistent with Bozionelos \n(2001) who has found that the greatest reductions in computer anxiety are associated \nwith earlier computer experiences. Experience has little impact on the computer \nanxiety of those low in computer anxiety. \n \nCollege\/university  students are an important sector of the population to investigate \nwith regard to technophobia: during a psychology student\u2019s first year for example, \nthey are required to undertake a great deal of IT-related work, whether it be word \nprocessing, statistical analysis or searching the Web or databases. A fear of \ntechnology sufficient to inhibit the utilisation of these resources will therefore have a \ndetrimental impact upon the student\u2019s learning experience. If this technophobia is \ncomparable in terms of amount of distress, range of underlying cognitions, and is \nassociated with the kinds of escape\/avoidance behaviour patterns found in specific \nphobia (Thorpe and Salkovskis 1998) then it should share some of the underlying \nbeliefs found in these phobias and should be equally susceptible to those treatment \nstrategies found to be successful with people who have specific phobias.  \n \nThe aim of this paper is therefore twofold. Firstly to conduct a SD computer anxiety \nreduction programme, extending beyond the assessment of computer anxiety to \nexamine the phobic factors identified by Thorpe and Salkovskis (1998) of coping, \nharm and disgust; and secondly to evaluate the impact of a single treatment \nprogramme (\u00d6st,1989; \u00d6st and Hugdahl 1981; \u00d6st, Salkovskis and Hellstr\u00f6m 1991; \nThorpe and Salkovskis, 1997) on anxiety responses and these targeted variables. \n \nSTUDY 1 \n 8\n \nParticipants:  \n \n16 participants were drawn from a student population in a North American college \nthat drew heavily upon local residents returning to education, part time. 8 were \nidentified as suffering from technophobia and 8 were matched non-anxious controls. \nThe treatment group consisted of individuals who volunteered to take part in a \nTechnophobia Reduction Programme (TRP). The controls were matched for age, sex, \nethnicity and academic level. There were 6 females (75%) and 2 males in each group \nand 50% of each group was black and 50% white. Ages ranged from 29-50 with mean \nof 43 and 40 (respectively, t=0.57, df=15, ns). \n \nDesign: \n \nAt the beginning off the programme (T1), phobic beliefs were assessed using the \nphobic beliefs questionnaire (Thorpe and Salkovskis, 1995 - which was initially based \non the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire, Chambless, Caputo, Bright and \nGallagher, 1984). For the phobics belief questionnaire, the word \u2018computer\u2019 was \nsubstituted for the word \u2018spider\u2019 (both versions elicit comparable levels of response in \npeople with technophobia and those with spider phobia respectively; Thorpe and \nBrosnan, in press).  Participants rated how much they believed each of 31 statements \nto be true on a scale of 0 (I do not believe this thought at all) to 100 (I am completely \nconvinced this thought is true) while imagining that their phobic object is in the room \nwith them.  Questions belonged to three categories: harm (e.g. \u201cI would have a heart \nattack\u201d); coping (e.g. \u201cI would not cope with it\u201d); and disgust (e.g. \u201cI would find it \n 9\nrepulsive\u201d). All three subscales of the phobic beliefs questionnaire were retained to be \nconsistent with previous phobia research. \n \nParticipants were also asked to complete the Clinically-Derived Assessment of \nTechnophobia (C-DAT, Brosnan and Rosen, 2001) using the same scale as above \nfrom 0 (strongly agree) through to 100 (strongly disagree). This has 6 items derived \nfrom the DSM-IV criteria. These were: For anxiety (DSM criteria a-d): 1) My anxiety \nabout computers bothers me. 2) I always feel anxious when using computers. 3) I am \nmore anxious about computers than I should be. 4) I go out of my way to avoid using \ncomputers. 5) It is easy for me to use computers. And for importance (DSM criterion \ne): 6) It is important for me to be able to use computers. This is scored as the phobic \nbeliefs questionnaire but the scale is reversed such that as low score indicates high \nlevels of anxiety. Typically factor analysis reveals 2 factors: anxiety (5 items) and \nimportance (1 item) (Brosnan and Rosen, 2001). A principal components factor \nanalysis (no rotations) confirmed that this structure was valid for this sample \naccounting for 80% of the variance (60% and 20% respectively). \n \nParticipants were also asked whether they were especially afraid of any of the \nfollowing: Animals, Heights, Closed spaces, Blood\/ injury or any other typical \nspecific phobia types but these were not in evidence. Participants were also asked for \ntheir age, sex and computer-related experience. \n \nThe technophobia Reduction Programme: \n \n 10\n A full account of the Technophobia Reduction Programme including its rationale \nappears in Brosnan, 1998 ( chapter 9) and all participants were supplied with a copy. \nThe programme stresses that computer skills are acquirable (Martocchio, 1994), \nchallenging and beneficial (Crable, Brodzinski, Sherer and Jones, 1994). The use of a \nfriend to model appropriate behaviour using software is encouraged (Gist, Schwoerer \nand Rosen, 1989; Keeler and Anson, 1995; Leso and Peck, 1992). The TRP is based \nupon systematic desensitisation programme within which participants develop an \nindividual hierarchy of imagined scenes increasing from low anxiety through to high \nanxiety situations. Participants then learn to relax in the situation identified as the \nlowest level of the hierarchy. This can be imagined first before actually attempted. \nThe tasks are then undertaken by the participants and progression up the hierarchy \noccurs one step at a time, only when perceptions of anxiety have been replaced by \nperceptions of relaxation at each level. \n \n At the initial group meeting students were asked to undertake the following activity: \n \n\u2018Imagine a scale of anxiety where 0 =no anxiety at all; 10 = only very slightly anxious \nthrough to 100 = extremely anxious. Now think of 1 activity that relates to each of the \ndifferent levels of anxiety for you\u2019. Participants were then presented with a visual \nanalogue scale from 10 (low anxiety) to 100 (high anxiety). The aim was for \nparticipants only to attempt the first task, that they had rated as producing only a low \nanxiety response (with a value of 10) in the first week. Examples of this included not \ndirectly interacting with computers (\u2018watching someone else typing into a computer\u2019, \n\u2018reading about computers\u2019) and simple (typically single-click) tasks (\u2018printing a \ndocument\u2019, \u2018turning the computer on\u2019). Task 2 (rated 20) to be attempted in week 2 \n 11\nand so on until task 10 (rated 100) was attempted in week 10. Examples of this \nincluded using a wider range of hardware or software (\u2018copying files to a floppy disk\u2019, \n\u2018send email\u2019, \u2018using the Internet\u2019) and using a computer publicly (\u2018using a computer \nin front of someone else\u2019). \n \nEach week participants were presented with a time sheet that asked them to log the \ntime spent on the week\u2019s task (in minutes) and the feeling of anxiety (from 0 to 100) \nat the beginning of each task \u2013 every time the task was attempted throughout the \nweek. Participants were also asked to detail any non-TRP computer-related activity. \nThe following week, the logs were collected and the next week\u2019s logs distributed. \nThis also served as a check that participants felt able to move up to the next level. At \nthe end of the programme (T2) the phobic beliefs and anxiety measures were re-\nadministered and participants were fully debriefed. Two weeks later, participants were \nasked for their perceptions of the programme. The six responses to this request (75%) \nappear at the end of the results section. The controls underwent the initial and final \nassessment sessions, experiencing no intervention in between these times. \n \nResults \n \nFrom the logs collected from the participants, the mean times and numbers of tasks \nattempted were collated. For the programme as a whole a mean of 948 minutes \n(sd=437; range=292-1766 mins) was spent on the programme. The tasks were \nattempted a mean of 45 times (sd=29; range=10-93) with a mean anxiety rating across \nall tasks of 39 (sd=19; range= 18-65). On average, participants spent around 95 \n 12\nminutes per week attempting each task 4 to 5 times \u2013 an average of around 20 minutes \neach weekday. \n \nTable 1 around here \n \nTable 1 contains the means and standard deviations for anxiety and the phobic beliefs \n(coping, harm, disgust) at the beginning of the programme (T1) and the end (T2) as \nwell as the differences (D) between T1 and T2. The groups were matched for age, sex \nand subject studied but did differ significantly in anxiety (t=3.26, df=14, p<0.01) at \nT1. By T2, this difference became non-significant (t=1.00, df=14, ns). The \ntechnophobic group improved by almost 25 points compared to 2 points for the \ncontrols, which was very close to significance (t=1.76, df=2, p=0.0505). At T1, The \ntechnophobic significantly differed from the controls on all of the anxiety items \nseparately, with the exception of item 4 \u2018it is important for me to use computers\u2019. \nBoth groups strongly agreed with this statement. There were no significant differences \nfor the separate items at T2.  \n \nA cut off point of 40 (or more) has been used to identify phobic levels on the belief \nquestionnaire (60 or less for coping which scales in the opposite direction, Thorpe and \nSalkovskis, 1995). At T1, the technophobic group fit into this definition but by T2, the \ntechnophobic group were within the normal range. With the exception of the \nimportance item, all separate anxiety items had a mean below 40 at T1 and above 40 \nat T2 for the technophobic group (controls were always above 40). \n \n 13\nAt T1 the technophobics were lower in coping cognitions (t=1.69, df=13, p=0.0507), \nhigher in harm (t=3.51, df=14, p<0.01) and disgust (t=2.08, df=14, p<0.05) which \nwere not significant at T2 (coping t=0.15, df=13, ns; harm t=1.19, df=13, ns; disgust \nt=1.59, df=13, ns). The differences in improvement were significant for coping and \nharm but not disgust (t=1.92, df=12, p<0.05; t=2.84, df=13, p<0.01; t=0.84, df=13, \nns) as would be expected, as disgust is an emotion not necessarily relevant to the issue \nof computer anxiety and those items were only included in the study in the interest of \nconsistency with previous research..   \n \nA within-participant analysis confirmed that the difference across time was significant \nfor the technophobics for anxiety (t=2.47, df=7, p<0.05), coping (t=2.42, df=7, \np<0.05) and harm  (t=3.52, df=7, P<0.05) cognitions but not for disgust cognitions  \nt=1.65, df=7, ns).   The difference across time was not significant for the controls \n(anxiety  t=0.24, df=7, ns; coping t=.17, df=5, ns; harm t=0.88, df=6, ns; disgust \nt=1.44, df=6, ns), indicating that the treatment was effective in changing beliefs about \nthe consequences of interacting with computers. \n \nAs mentioned above, a cut off point of 40 (or more) has been used to identify phobic \nlevels on the belief questionnaire (60 or less for coping which scales in the opposite \ndirection, Thorpe and Salkovskis, 1995). Lack of coping cognitions were endorsed at \nthe phobic levels at T1 but not at phobic levels for harm or disgust cognitions (i.e. less \nthan 40). Coping cognitions were within the normal range by T2. Although there were \nsignificant differences in both harm and disgust cognitions, these differences are not \nwithin the phobic range of greater than 40 identified by Thorpe and Salkovskis \n(1995). \n 14\n \nAdditional qualitative information: \n \nAfter the researcher had left the institution, participants were asked for their \ncomments concerning the programme by an interested member of permanent Faculty \nstaff.. After the comments had been submitted, participants were asked whether the \ncomments could be forwarded to the researcher or not. The concluding remarks from \nthe 6 participants who gave their permission for the comments to be reproduced \nappear below (there was no response from the remaining 2): \n \nP1) This class has helped me face my fears about computers. I have been able to \ndecrease my anxiety over computers and increase my knowledge of computers. I now \nfeel more confident and capable when it comes to computers. \n \nP2) I learned a lot about anxiety and how I\u2019m affected by it. At the same time, I \nlearned some valuable computer skills. I realized that computers are everywhere and \nit is better that everyone learns to feel comfortable using them. \n \nP3) When I volunteered for this project, I had never been on a computer. I would not \neven think about a computer at all. I would write my papers and have my sister type \nthem for me. Even though I still have some anxiety when it comes to the computer, \nthis project has helped me out a lot. I now have a computer in my home and I even \ntyped my last two papers for this class on my computer. \n \nP4) Some basics can be drawn: First, the admittance that I\u2019m anxious about computers \nand verbal self-persuasion can be used to overcome my fears. Second, that watching \nsomeone else work on the [computer] was very helpful in alleviating my discomfort \nand fears. Lastly, after doing many functions on the P.C., I found that exploring \nbeyond just the minimal is becoming easier on the computer. I now feel empowered \nto use the computer at home in a way that is completely within my comfort zone. \n \nP5) I am aware that my anxiety has dramatically lowered. The reduction program \nworked for me and was well worth the weeks of time and effort.   I have noticed other \nchanges too. I no longer stumble over my words when I talk about computers, the \nquality of my work has increased, and I have opened up to the enjoyment of looking \nthrough the Internet for my own interests. Even though I did not come out of the \nprogram able to do complicated tasks on computers, I accomplished something more \nimportant. I got rid of the anxiety that prevented me from learning about them in the \nfirst place. \n \nP6) I believe the program was a success because I no longer avoid computers and my \nconfidence level has greatly increased. \n 15\n \n \nDiscussion: \n \nThere is some support for the hypothesis that the Technophobia Reduction \nProgramme would result in a lowering of levels of anxiety relating to computers.  \nAssessments of computer anxiety were significantly improved as were beliefs about \ncoping. The data suggest that the programme reduces phobic levels of anxiety and \ninability to cope, to within the normal range. This is interesting as coping skills were \nnot explicitly taught. The only explicit instructions were relaxation-based. The reports \nwritten by participants confirm this. All participants report that they subjectively feel \nless anxious and more confident, for example participant 4 reported \u2018I now feel \nempowered to use the computer\u2026\u2019. The tangible benefits are evident in the report for \nparticipant 3 who now types up her own essays rather than writing them up by hand \nand getting her sister to type them up for her. The ethos of the programme is reflected \nin participant 5 who reported \u2018Even though I did not come out of the program able to \ndo complicated tasks on computers, I accomplished something more important. I got \nrid of the anxiety that prevented me from learning about them in the first place\u2019. \n \nThe method proved successful, both in terms of responses to formal assessments and \nself-perceptions. Additionally, the input from those administering the programme is \nminimal for most of the programme, typically an hour a week for collection\/ \ndistribution of the log sheets (though the initial and final sessions require longer). The \ngroup did not report any additional contact with one another as a result of being on the \nTRP suggesting the programme could be extended to larger numbers. \nMethodologically, this may allow for the provision of a random allocation to control \n 16\nand treatments groups, which would be beneficial in evaluating the TRP. It is possible \nthe treatment group would have improved anyway but unlikely, given that they were \naround 40 years of age and demonstrating technophobia in the final stages of their \nreturn to education. 10 weeks is also a significant proportion of an academic semester. \nIf the same benefits could be gained from a shorter clinically-derived treatment, this \nwould also be advantageous. Finally, identifying long term effects of a treatment \nprogramme would enhance the evaluation. \n \nSTUDY 2: \n \nStudy one was successful in anxiety reduction and improving the coping factor \nassociated with phobic beliefs (Thorpe and Salkovskis, 1998) to levels comparable to \nthose found in the non-anxious group. There is evidence to suggest that \nTechnophobics experience similar levels of anxiety to that found in spider phobics \n(Thorpe and Brosnan, in press) and one session treatment has been found to be \nsuccessful with a variety of phobias including spider phobia (\u00d6st,1989; \u00d6st and \nHugdahl 1981; \u00d6st, Salkovskis and Hellstr\u00f6m 1991; Thorpe and Salkovskis, 1997) \nand blood-injury phobia  (\u00d6st, Sterner, and Fellanius, 1989). \n \nThus the second study applies a single session anxiety intervention to people \npresenting themselves as technophobic. It randomly allocates these participants the \nintervention or non-intervention group and evaluates the effectiveness of the \nintervention after an academic year. \n \nMethodology: \n 17\n \nParticipants: \n \n89 psychology undergraduates were assessed at the beginning and end of their first \nacademic year at University (September and June). 74 (83%) were female, which is \nconsistent with psychology majors across Europe and the USA (Radford and \nHoldstock, 1995; 1996). The participants\u2019 ages ranged from 18 to 41 with a mean age \nof 21 years (s.d. = 5 years). 85% were 21 or under. \n \nDesign: \n \nThe original groups were derived from measures used in the diagnosis of more \nestablished phobias. Spider phobics report a mean of 40 (s.d. 25) on the first item of \nthe visual analogue scale (\u2018I am anxious about spiders\u2019, see above) which is consistent \nwith the demarcations used for grouping phobics in the published literature (Thorpe \nand Salkovskis, 1998). As the anxiety scale is in the reverse direction (low scores \nidentify high anxiety),  technophobics were therefore identified as those with an \nanxiety score of 60 or below (see Thorpe and Brosnan, in press). This resulted in a \nthird of the sample as being identified as technophobic, which is consistent with the \nliterature described in the Introduction. Those with a score of 60 or below were then \nrandomly allocated to either the treated or nontreated experimental groups. However, \ndue to an administrative error, 5 of those assigned to treatment were accidentally \nassigned to nontreatment. Although this made for unbalanced groups, it was felt to be \npreferable to retain all participants within their original allocation and retain them all \n 18\nwithin the analysis. The remaining participants formed the control group for \ncomparison. The groups comprised: \n \nControls: 47 (80%) females 12 males 59 total \nTreated   8 (89%) females  1 male   9 total \nNontreated 19 (90%) females  2 males 21 total \n \nThere were no significant age differences between groups (F=1.1, df=2,87, ns). 93% \nof the experimental groups were  21 or under. \n \nProcedure: \n \nParticipants were assessed twice. Time 1 (T1) was  in the first week of academic term \nin September. Time 2 (T2) was at the end of this first academic year in June (10 \nmonths later).  On both occasions the participants were assessed with the C-DAT and \nPhobic questionnaires described in study 1.  An initial question was added to assess \nperceived tolerance of the stimuli (after Thorpe and Salkovskis, 1998) \u2018confident are \nyou that you would be able to tolerate being in the same room as a computer right \nnow \u2018.  The scale ranged form 0 (not at all confident) to 100 (totally confident). \n \nThe Clinically-Derived Assessment of Technophobia was again used, as described in \nstudy 1. State and Trait anxiety (Speilberger, 1996) were also assessed to confirm that \ntechnophobics did not differ from controls on these variables.  Given the \nindependence of these variables to computer anxiety, the single intervention \n 19\nprogramme was thought unlikely to impact upon these variables but assessments were \ntaken at the beginning and end to examine this issue. \n \nAt T1, participants were asked their age and sex and how many hours per week were \nspent using a computer (on average) at home and work\/college. \n \nThe control and untreated groups received no further intervention. The treated group \nunderwent a single one hour intervention session (Thorpe and Salkovskis, 1997) and \nwere given a small book, \u2018Controlling anxiety\u2019 (Fennel and Butler, 1985). A single \nsession of this type has been shown to have long-term beneficial effects (\u00d6st,1989; \n\u00d6st and Hugdahl 1981; \u00d6st, Salkovskis and Hellstr\u00f6m 1991; Thorpe and Salkovskis, \n1997). \n \nMultivariate statistics were used to identify the differences between the three groups, \nfollowed by T-tests which were primarily used to be consistent with the analysis from \nstudy 1. T-tests were conducted between the two experimental groups (treated and \nnontreated). Both groups were then compared to the control group. As there are two \ntesting sessions, it is also possible to conduct a within-participant analysis (paired-\nsample T-tests). It was predicted that the treated group would improve to a greater \ndegree than the nontreated group. When comparing to the control group, non-\ndirectional hypotheses are made as the means after treatment may be higher or lower \nthan the control group. Occasionally participants did not complete all items, which \nleads to a small variation in the degrees of freedom reported. \n \nResults: \n 20\n \nAs would be expected, the control groups used computers twice as much as the \nexperimental groups (12 hours vs. 6 hours per average week) which was significant \n(t=2.7, df=84, p<0.01).  A multivariate analysis revealed that at the beginning of the \nstudy (T1) there were group differences in anxiety (F2,85=44.66, p<0.001), Disgust \nF2,56=5.04, p=0.01) and tolerance (F2,54=17.91, p<0.001) but not Coping (F2,82=1.09, \nns) and harm (F2,84=1.27, ns). Similarly at the end of the study (T2) there were group \ndifferences in Anxiety (F2,86=11.05, p<0.001) and Tolerance (F2,87=11.58, p<0.001) \nbut not the cognitions (Coping F2,84=1.57, ns; Harm F2,86=1.89, ns; Disgust F2,87=1.13, \nns). When examining the group differences between T1 and T2, there were significant \ndifferences for Anxiety (F2,87=10.28, p<0.001), Coping (F2,80=5.59, p=0.005), Disgust \n(F2,56=6.49, p<0.005) and Tolerance (F2,54=11.22, p<0.001) but not Harm (F2,83=0.43, \nns). The means for all the variables are shown in Table 2, with  a T-test analysis of \ngroup differences where the multivariate statistics identified group differences. \n \nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nComparison between the two experimental groups: treated and nontreated. \n \nTable 2 shows that there were no differences between the two technophobic groups at \nT1. By T2, the treated group had less anxiety than the non-treated group (t=1.8, \ndf=28, p<0.05). Relatedly, the difference in anxiety between T1 and T2 was greater \nfor the treated group than the non-treated group (t=1.8, df=27, p<0.05). The increase \nin coping cognitions was approaching significantly improving for the treated group \n 21\n(t=1.65, df=27, p=0.056).  Finally, the tolerance for computers was higher at T2 for \nthe treated group than the non-treated group (t=2.1, df=28, p<0.05).  \n \nComparisons within each group \n \nA paired t-test analysis confirms that the difference in anxiety is significant for the \ntreated group (t=3.4, 8, p=0.005) but not quite for the nontreated group (t=1.6, 19, ns). \nSimilarly there is an increase in coping cognitions and a decrease in disgust \ncognitions with no change in harm cognitions for both experimental groups (treated \nt=3.2, 8, p<0.01; t=2.1, 8, p<0.05; t=1.3, 8, ns; nontreated t=2.6, 19, p<0.01; t=2.7, \n14, p<0.01; t=0.4, 19, ns; respectively). There were no within-participant differences \nfor the control group. \n \nComparisons between the experimental groups and the control group \n \nAs one would expect there was a significant difference at T1 in computer anxiety \nbetween the control group and both the treated and non-treated experimental group \n(t=8.4, df=61, p<0.001; t=9.6, df=72, p<0.001) and tolerance (t=4.3, df=39, p<0.001; \nt=6.0, df=45, p<0.001). There were no significant differences in coping or harm \ncognitions but there was in disgust cognitions (t=3.1, df=41, ns; t=3.0, df=47, ns).  \n \nAt T2 there were no significant differences between the control group and the treated \ngroup. The nontreated experimental group, however, still significantly differed from \nthe control group in anxiety (t=4.9, df=73, p<0.001) and tolerance (t=4.5, df=73, \np<0.001). \n 22\n \nExamining the changes between T1 and T2, the control group changed less than both \nthe treated and non-treated experimental groups in anxiety (t=4.7, df=61, p<0.001; \nt=2.4, df=72, p<0.05) disgust (t=2.8, df=41, p<0.01; t=3.4, df=47, p<0.001) and \ntolerance (t=4.3, df=39, p<0.001; t=3.4, df=45, p<0.001). Additionally, the difference \nin coping cognitions was significant between the control group and the treated group \n(t=3.0, df=60, p<0.005) but not significant between the control the non-treated group \n(t=1.8, df=71, ns). \n \nComparisons with State and Trait Anxiety \n \nThere were no between groups differences in state or trait anxiety. The two \nexperimental groups did not differ from each other in state or trait anxiety at the \nbeginning or end of the study. Similarly the 2 experimental groups did not differ from \nthe control group in state or trait anxiety at the beginning or end of the study (all \np>0.05). Examining the within participant differences also confirmed that there were \nno significant differences in trait anxiety for all three groups between the beginning \nand end of the study. There were within-participant differences in state anxiety, \nhowever. Both experimental groups significantly reduced levels of state anxiety \n(treated: t=4.0, 8, p<0.005; nontreated: t=3.1, 13, p<0.01; control: t=0.9, 34, ns) \nbetween the beginning and end of the study. \n \nExamining covariates with changes in anxiety \n \n 23\nConducting ANCOVAs revealed that the differences in anxiety by intervention group \nremained significant with changes in all three types of belief were entered as \ncovariates (Coping, Harm and Disgust, F2,50=4.38, p<0.05) , when change in tolerance \nwas entered as a covariate (F2,53=3.24, p<0.05) and when change in state anxiety was \nentered as a covariate (F2,54=8.28, p<0.001). \n \nDiscussion: \n \nThere were no differences between the experimental groups at the beginning of the \nstudy. By the end of the study, the group who had taken part in the intervention were \nsignificantly less anxious than the anxious control group to the extent that they did not \ndiffer significantly from the control group.  The untreated group, however, remained \nsignificantly more anxious than the controls (and the treated group by the end of the \nstudy). This pattern is repeated in the tolerance item with the treated group feeling \nsignificantly more confident of being able to tolerate being in front of a computer. \nThe within-participant analysis highlighted a significant reduction in the treated group \nthat did not occur in the untreated group. Although there were reductions in the \nphobic beliefs of the treated group, the data suggest that changes in phobic beliefs, \ntolerance or state anxiety did not underpin the reduction in anxiety. \n \nThere were small variations in the harm and disgust cognitions but the means were \nvery low (between 0-10 on a 0-100 scale). The experimental group did score \nsignificantly higher on the disgust subscales at the beginning, but not at the end of the \nstudy. This suggests that phobic beliefs concerning disgust, whilst not at phobic levels \nin this group of technophobics, are a significant factor, though the interpretations of \n 24\nthe disgust belief items is likely to be different in this group to those typically found \nin  more disgust-relevant phobias. \n \nObviously the treatment was not the only IT-related experience the participants had \nduring the study. The non-treated group did improve their levels of anxiety and \ncoping cognitions during this period.  However, it is interesting to note that the one-\nhour treatment session tripled the effect of anxiety reduction that experience alone \nmay have contributed. This is equivalent to the size of the effect (3.5 times) reported \nby Rosen et al. (1993) \n \nIt is important to note that participants in Study 2 have been continuously exposed to \nIT throughout their academic experience, from the age of 5 onwards. School \nchildren\u2019s experience of IT between the ages of 5-18, appears to be resulting in some \ncollege-bound students who are technophobic \u2013  in some cases as anxious about IT as \nspider phobics are about spiders (Thorpe and Brosnan, in press).   Study 2 identified \nthat a third of the sample was to some extent technophobic, which is consistent with \nthe literature. The classification process, however, used an item matched from an \nassessment of spider phobia, suggesting that people with technophobia are as anxious \nabout computers as people with spider phobia are about spiders (on this item at least). \nObviously a diagnosis would be based on more than a response to one item but the \nresults are consistent with Bozionelos (2001) who found that an earlier exposure to \ntechnology has increased levels of anxiety about technology and that computer \nanxiety is prevalent in  college students. \n \nConclusion: \n 25\n \nThe aim of the paper has not been to pathologise technophobia but to highlight it as a \nlegitimate issue for up to a third of the population.  With one in 20 experiencing levels \nof anxiety comparable to traditional phobias (and one in three on specific items) \ntreatment may be an appropriate option. These studies have demonstrated that \nrelatively simple clinically-derived anxiety reduction techniques have a significant \nimpact on perceived levels of technophobia. Many colleges have an individual \nqualified to perform such a procedure, quickly and efficiently. A 1-hour treatment \nsession demonstrated a tripling in the anxiety reduction over an academic year.  The \nimpact of such a brief intervention has been demonstrated, however further research is \nrequired to better understand the processes that underpin anxiety reduction. \n \nThe Implications also extend beyond education. As many clinical assessments \nbecome computerised, computer anxiety can impact upon the performance of the \nparticipant on the measure (Browndyke, Albert, Malone, et al., 2002). This is \nsignificant as validation of computerised versions of traditional assessments are \nunlikely to involve technophobics in validation studies. Technophobia has also been \nidentified in almost all occupational settings. As anxiety reduction has been \ndemonstrated to improve academic attendance and the quality of academic work, it \nseems highly probable that organizations can benefit from addressing this issue. A \nsurvey of 10,000 UK office workers identified 25% who reported some \nsymptomatology, and undiagnosed anxiety conditions typically accounted for more \ndays off work that backache and stomach upset (Summerskill, 2001). Technophobia \ncan manifest itself in clinical proportions resulting in severely negative outcomes. \nThis paper has highlighted that technophobia should be addressed as a serious issue \n 26\nand that great gains can be made through the application of clinically-based anxiety \nreduction techniques.   \n \n 27\nTable 1: Comparison between treated and control groups \n \nN=8,8 Technophobes Controls P \nT1: Anxiety 19.4 (13.5) 54.0 (26.8) P<0.01 \nT1: Coping 50.2 (17.7) 65.7 (17.6) P=0.057 \nT1: Harm 16.3 (10.2) 2.6 (4.3) P<0.01 \nT1: Disgust 9.5 (10.0) 1.8 (3.1) P<0.05 \n    \nT2: Anxiety 44.3 (21.2) 55.9 (25.4) Ns \nT2: Coping 64.3 (12.3) 63.4 (11.3) Ns \nT2: Harm 4.1 (5.1) 1.5 (2.8) Ns \nT2: Disgust 5.0 (8.3) 0.0 (0.0) Ns \n    \nD: Anxiety 24.9 (28.5) 2.0 (23.6) P=0.0505\nD: Coping 14.1 (16.5) 2.3 (10.7) P<0.05 \nD: Harm 12.2 (9.8) 1.1 (3.3) P<0.01 \nD: Disgust 4.5 (7.7) 1.8 (3.4) Ns \n \nKey: T1: Time 1 at the beginning of the academic semester; T2: Time 2 \u2013 10 weeks \nlater; D: Difference between T1 and T2. \n 28\n \nTable 2: Comparison between treated and non-treated experimental groups, which are \nboth compared to a control group. \n \n treated non-treated P Control P \nTreat \nP non \nT1: Anxiety 42.0 (17.0) 45.4 (15.2) Ns 72.4 (8.6) <0.001 <0.001\nT1: Coping 58.7 (22.2) 61.9 (15.2)  66.2 (17.2)   \nT1: Harm 6.8 (5.5) 7.3 (8.8)  4.9 (6.5)   \nT1: Disgust 8.6 (9.9) 10.2 (14.9) Ns 2.2 (3.7) <0.005 <0.005\nT1: Tol 48.9 (35.5) 50.7 (20.5) Ns 84.4 (16.6) <0.001 <0.001\n       \nT2: Anxiety 64.3 (12.6) 53.1 (16.6) <0.05 70.5 (12.0) Ns <0.001\nT2: Coping 75.1 (16.3) 69.5 (14.1)  66.9 (14.5)   \nT2: Harm 3.4 (5.2) 6.4 (6.9)  3.8 (5.2)   \nT2: Disgust 1.4 (4.3) 4.5 (10.1)  2.2 (4.8)   \nT2: Tol 92.2 (10.9) 75.2 (22.5) <0.05 93.1 (11.0) Ns <0.001\n       \nD: Anxiety -22.2 (19.9) -7.8 (20.6) <0.05 2.0 (13.4) <0.001 <0.05 \nD: Coping -16.3 (15.4) -7.4 (12.6) =0.056 -0.9 (14.0) <0.005 Ns \nD: Harm 3.3 (7.5) 0.6 (7.4)  1.0 (8.0)   \nD: Disgust 7.1 (10.1) 9.0 (13.0) Ns 0.0 (5.7) <0.01 <0.001\nD: Tol -43.3 (30.4) -30.7 (24.9) Ns -8.4 (18.7) <0.001 <0.001\n       \nT1: State 37.6 (7.8) 39.5 (10.3)  36.2 (8.6)   \nT1: Trait 38.3 (5.5) 42.5 (8.7)  38.0 (9.5)   \nT2: State 31.8 (6.5) 33.0 (10.0)  33.9 (9.5)   \nT2: Trait 34.9 (8.4) 38.5 (9.4)  38.2 (7.6)   \n       \n \nKey: T1: Time 1 at the beginning of the academic year; T2: Time 2 at the end of the \nacademic year; D: Difference between T1 and T2.
