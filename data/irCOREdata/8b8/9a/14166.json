In an attempt to explore how learning technologists are developing practices to produce\naccessible electronic materials this paper will present a review of the accessibility literature and iden-\ntify key issues that may influence the \u2018accessibility\u2019 practices of learning technologists. These emerg-\ning issues are interpreted using Wenger\u2019s theory of communities of practice, with a particular\nemphasis on the development of accessibility practices that may be shared by a number of related\ncommunities of practices and on how the focus of accessibility practices may soon shift from the\nproduct to the process of accessibility.\nIntroduction\nThe UK\u2019s 2001 Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (SENDA) was brought\nin as an amendment to the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) and is being\nimplemented as Part IV of that Act (HMSO, 1995, 2001). From 1 September 2002,\nSENDA made it an offence for educational institutions to discriminate against a\ndisabled person by treating him or her less favourably than others for a reason relating\nto their disability. The Act covers all aspects of student services, but the particular\naspects that are relevant to the work of learning technologists include e-learning,\ndistance learning, examinations, assessments and learning resources (including\nlibraries and computer facilities).\nThose skilled in interpreting the law have been heavily involved in trying to translate\nthe implications of SENDA 2001 for the learning technology community.

Seale\n            The legislation affects the provision of Information Technology and Computing Services\nin the very widest sense of the phrase and ignoring the legislation is not an option.\nOn one level her advice is clear: educational institutions cannot avoid responsibility.\nBut with regards to web accessibility, her advice reveals that whilst there is an\nimperative not to ignore the legislation, how educational institutions attempt to\nimplement the law in practice is likely to vary greatly depending on their understand-\ning and interpretation of what standards the courts will use as benchmarks when\njudging \u2018reasonable adjustment\u2019.\nSuch interpretations of the law suggest a potential tension for learning technolo-\ngists. One the one hand it is very clear that they must respond to SENDA, but on the\nother a clearly understood and articulated practice that defines and lays out how the\nimplications of SENDA can be implemented may de difficult to identify.\nIn an attempt to identify and describe the development or shaping of emerging\n\u2018accessibility\u2019 practices, Seale (2003) presented a review of literature that focused on\nlearning technologists\u2019 interpretation of and response to the legislation. Seale used the\nconcept of communities of practice (Wenger, 1998) to explore and discuss these\ninterpretations and responses and argue that there was evidence that a community of\npractice was beginning to emerge and that the enterprise of this community was to\ndevelop a clearly understood and articulated practice that defines and describes how\nthe implications of SENDA can be implemented. This paper expands and builds on\nthe review of Seale (2003) and explores in greater depth the value of conceiving the\naccessibility community as a constellation of related communities and the implication\nthis has for our understanding of accessibility practices in e-learning.\nA review of accessibility practices in e-learning\nIn order to explore what key professionals (academics, researchers, educational devel-\nopers and staff developers) within the learning technology field in the UK were saying\nand doing about making electronic materials and resources accessible to disabled\nstudents a review was undertaken of literature published between January 2000 and\nSeptember 2003. In order to encompass the experiences of both researchers and prac-\ntitioners the review covered academic and professional literature and included journal\narticles, books, newsletter articles and web-based materials. The review was also\nlimited to material that focused on UK based accessibility initiatives and practices.\nThis review revealed four key issues that may influence the \u2018accessibility\u2019 practices\nof learning technologists in the UK: \n\u0002 the difficulties of responding to SENDA;\n\u0002 the identification and implementation of existing accessibility tools and guidelines\nin order to comply with SENDA;\n\u0002 the adaptation or re-framing of generic accessibility tools and guidelines for more\nspecific practice(s);\n\u0002 a call to involve disabled people or their advocates in the design of electronic material.\nSeale (2003) reports these issues in detail; a summary is provided here.\n The development of accessibility practices in e-learning:\n \n53\n            The difficulties of responding to SENDA\nThe DDA 1995 has been described as an example of an \u201cincreasingly complex and\nencroaching legislation, which tends to creep up on the unsuspecting manager of an\nHEI\u201d (Palfreyman & Warner, 2002, p. 423). These sentiments of sympathy for senior\nmanagers continue in the current discussion of the legal imperatives of SENDA and\nare coupled with a perception that higher educational institutions will find it difficult\nto respond to SENDA (see, for example, Wilson et al., 2002).\nThe difficulties in responding to SENDA are also expressed in terms of how indi-\nviduals will have to learn a lot of new information very quickly when attempting to\ndesign or develop new accessible materials (Ormerod, 2002; Witt & McDermott,\n2002).\nThe identification and implementation of existing accessibility tools and guidelines in order \nto comply with SENDA\nA number of accessibility guidelines were in existence prior to SENDA and a review\nof the literature reveals a large number of articles that attempt to suggest how they\ncould be used to help comply with the act. The most commonly cited guidelines are\nthose that focus on web accessibility, for example those produced by the world wide\nweb consortium (WC3), most specifically the web content accessibility guidelines\n(WCAG). These outline three priority levels and the general consensus seems to be\nto design for priority 1 and 2 (McCarthy, 2002).\nThe experience of Witt and McDermott (2002) led them to report how they\nneeded to produce their own simplified version of the WCAG because \u2018extracting the\ndesired information can be confusing\u2019. Some simplified guidelines do however,\nappear to rather over-simplified. For example, the \u2018accessibility golden rules\u2019 of\nSloan et al. (2000) includes the rather vague rule, \u2018use valid HTML and follow the\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines\u2019. The existence of overly simple or overly\ncomplicated guidelines lead Jeffels and Marston (2003) to argue for guides that are\ndirectly relevant to learning technology developers and which are closely linked to or\nembedded in practical and local issues where appropriate.\nThe adaptation or re-framing of generic accessibility tools and guidelines for more specific \npractice(s)\nAttempts to create more meaningful and relevant interpretations of guidelines have\nresulted in two distinct practices. The first practice focuses on the production of tech-\nnology specific guidelines (Pearson & Koppi, 2001; Sloan et al., 2003; Smith, 2002;\nStiles, 2001). For example, Pearson and Koppi (2001) evaluated the accessibility of\nWebCT in practice at University of New South Wales and distilled their findings into\na set of guidelines for academic designers of WebCT courses.\nThe second practice focuses on the production disability specific guidelines. For\nexample Blankfield (2002), Lockley (2002) and Rainger (2003) give some advice on\n 54\n \nJ. Seale\n             making web based course materials accessible to dyslexic students. Whilst Lockley\noffers five simple design guidelines, there is no indication of whether these guidelines\nare grounded in practice and experience. Blankfield on the other hand based what she\ncalls \u2018good practice\u2019 guidelines on interviews that she had conducted with dyslexic\nstudents who were using WebCT, whilst Rainger indicates that his guide is derived\nfrom \u2018practitioner\u2019s experience and usability research\u2019.\nA call to involve disabled people or their advocates in the design of electronic material\nPearson and Koppi (2001) argue that the key to accessible courseware is to take a\nlearner-centred design approach, while Smith (2002) emphasises the involvement of\ndyslexic students in his design of a Virtual Learning Environment Interface and\nmakes a plea for a wider deployment of user testing.\nIn addition to the call to involve disabled students there is a call to engage in a\ndialogue with people who are knowledgeable about the needs and concerns of\nstudents with disabilities (Conroy 2002; Middling & Bostock, 2002; Phipps, 2002).\nFor example, Phipps (2002) urges staff and educational developers to give serious\nconsideration to using \u2018non-traditional facilitators\u2019 such as disability officers for\nworkshops in this field.\nA framework for exploring the enterprise of accessibility\nThe Disability Discrimination Legislation has charged learning technologists with the\nresponsibility of developing accessible electronic teaching material and resources.\nUsing concepts from Wenger\u2019s (1998) Communities of Practice framework, learning\ntechnologists could be viewed as needing to pursue an \u2018enterprise\u2019 of accessibility.\nThe issues drawn out from a review of the literature could therefore be interpreted as\nrepresenting learning technologists attempts to define this enterprise and start to\ncollectively describe practices that reflect the pursuit of this enterprise.\nIn an attempt to further explore and understand this enterprise and its resulting\npractices the results of the literature review will be interpreted using Wenger\u2019s\nconcept of \u2018practice\u2019, which is understood as: \n\u0002 giving structure and meaning to what communities do;\n\u0002 being a source of coherence for a community; and\n\u0002 having boundaries and peripheries that may link with other communities.\nA practice that gives structure and meaning to what learning technologists do\nAccording to Wenger, practice is about \u2018meaning as an experience of everyday life\u2019.\nHe argues that what is important about the pursuit of enterprises is the meanings\nthat are produced from these pursuits. Meaning is located in a process he termed\n\u2018negotiation of meaning\u2019, which involves the interaction of two processes: participa-\ntion and reification. If participation in communities shapes our experience through\n The development of accessibility practices in e-learning:\n \n55\n      membership and active engagement, reification gives form to our experience by\nproducing objects that \u2018congeal this experience into thingness\u2019.\nReification creates points of focus around which the negotiation of meaning\nbecomes organised. So for example reification produce a range of laws, procedures\nor tools. The negotiation of meaning, therefore, may become focused around using a\nlaw to argue a point, using a procedure to know what to do or using a tool to perform\nan action. The findings from the literature review might suggest that in the pursuit of\nan accessibility enterprise, the negotiation of meaning for the learning technology\ncommunity may currently be focused more on reification than participation. The\nliterature is dominated by the description and discussion of laws (e.g. SENDA,\n2001), procedures (e.g. WCAG) and tools (e.g. the LIFT plug-in). The ultimate\nartefacts of practices that learning technologists might develop in the pursuit of an\naccessibility enterprise would be actual accessible electronic learning materials.\nHowever, the literature pointed to very few examples of these (Smith, 2002; Witt &\nMcDermott, 2002).\nWenger recognised that a very large portion of reification involved in work prac-\ntices can come from outside communities. In this case he argues reification must be\nre-appropriated into a local process in order to become meaningful. The findings\nfrom the literature review present some evidence for re-appropriation. As example of\nthis is the re-framing and adaptation of general accessibility guidelines (WCAG) that\nhave been associated with national laws (SENDA) to suit local or more specific\nneeds (Blankfield, 2002; Lockley, 2002; Pearson & Koppi, 2001; Rainger, 2003;\nSloan et al., 2000).\nWenger talks of the \u2018double edge of reification\u2019 and states that a good tool can reify\nan activity so as to amplify its effects while making the activity effortless. A bad tool,\ntherefore, can \u2018ossify activities around its inertness\u2019. From the literature review there\nis some evidence that learning technologists would recognise this phenomena, for\nexample, those who point to the inappropriate use of the Bobby logo on web sites\n(Phipps et al., 2002; Witt & McDermott, 2002).\nThe Bobby logo displayed a statement of the values of accessibility and had become\nsomething that people could point to and strive for. Yet as a reification it did not\ncapture the richness of what is understood by accessibility because it could be appro-\npriated in misleading ways. It could therefore become a false representation of what\nit was intended to reflect. In some part the learning technology community has recog-\nnised this in its move away from Bobby and towards WCAG (McCarthy, 2002;\nWilder, 2002; Witt & McDermott, 2002).\nWenger warns that if reification prevails over participation, if everything is reified\nbut with little opportunity for shared experience and interactive negotiation, then\nthere may not be enough overlap in participation to recover a co-ordinated, genera-\ntive meaning. The learning technology community may certainly be in danger of this.\nFindings from the literature review would suggest a prevalence of laws, guidelines and\ntools. For example, Witt and McDermott (2002) report that a recent audit of acces-\nsibility software identified 30 site-evaluation tools, 10 web page repair tools and over\n20 filter and transformation tools.\n 56\n \nJ. Seale\n         Practice that is a source of coherence for the learning technology community\nWenger describes three dimensions by which practice is a source of coherence for a\ncommunity: mutual engagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoire. In defining\nmutual engagement Wenger states that practice exists because people are engaged in\nactions whose meanings they negotiate with one another. What makes a community\nof practice out of a medley of people is their mutual engagement as they make things\nhappen. In the learning technology community we certainly have a medley of people\n(disability officers, academics, researchers, staff developers, etc.); the literature review\nproduced some examples of how these different people are attempting to work\ntogether to develop \u2018accessible\u2019 online learning material (e.g. Conroy, 2002;\nMiddling & Bostock, 2002).\nIn defining and discussing the concept of joint enterprise, Wenger introduces the\nnotion of \u2018indigenous enterprise\u2019 and argues that conditions, resources and demands\nwill only shape practice if the community has negotiated that. To exemplify this,\nWenger gives an example of a community of practice that has arisen in response to\nsome outside mandate and argues that practice evolves into the community\u2019s own\nresponse to that mandate. This example has some resonance for the learning technol-\nogy community who might perhaps see SENDA as an outside mandate that has been\nimposed on the community. If we accept the findings of the literature review as\nevidence that members of the community are attempting to produce a practice to deal\nwith what they understand to be their enterprise, their practice as it unfolds will\nbelong to the community, even though external drivers such as SENDA may have\nprompted it.\nPractice that has boundaries and peripheries that may link with other communities\nAccording to Wenger, communities of practice cannot be considered independently\nof other practices. Their various enterprises are closely interconnected, their\nmembers and their artefacts are not theirs alone. Communities of practice are there-\nfore sources of boundary and contexts for creating connections. Wenger presents two\nkinds of connections: boundary objects and brokering. Boundary objects are defined\nas artefacts, documents, terms, concepts, and other forms of reification around which\ncommunities of practice can organize their interconnections. Brokering is described\nas the connections provided by people who can introduce elements of one practice\ninto another.\nConnection one: boundary objects\nArtefacts such as SENDA and WCAG could be viewed as boundary objects in the\nsense that multiple constituencies refer to them in the literature when trying to\nnegotiate or define theirs and others practice, e.g.: \n\u0002 academics (Blankfield, 2002; Conroy, 2002; Ormerod, 2002);\n\u0002 staff developers (Middling & Bostock, 2002);\n The development of accessibility practices in e-learning:\n \n57\n                \u0002 researchers (Wilson et al., 2002);\n\u0002 technicians\/technologists (Smith, 2002; Witt & McDermott, 2002).\nWenger notes that the design of artefacts (documents, systems, tools) is often the\ndesign of boundary objects. He illustrated this by giving an example of designers of\ncomputer systems, who focus on issues of use and often employ the term \u2018the user\u2019 as\na generic term with \u2018mythical proportions\u2019. From this perspective, \u2018use\u2019 is a relation\nbetween a user and an artefact. However, that user engages in certain practices and\nis therefore a member of certain communities of practice. Artefacts can therefore be\nboundary objects, and designing them might involve designing for participation\nrather than just use. Designing accessible e-learning material may therefore involve\ndesigning boundary objects in the sense that that may enable users (students with\ndisabilities) to engage in practices that enable them to participate in a number of\ncommunities, including learning communities.\nConnection two: brokers\nWenger argued that when people transfer from one community of practice to another,\nor have multi-membership, they can transfer some element of one practice into\nanother through \u2018brokering\u2019. Brokers are able to make new connections across\ncommunities of practice, enable coordination, and open new possibilities for mean-\ning. This notion of brokers who can create connections between communities is\nreflected in the literature that discusses the role of staff developers. For example,\nMiddling and Bostock (2002) describe how in response to SENDA legislation their\ninstitution has begun to develop staff development programmes jointly between\nDisability Services, Staff Development teams and departments, while Phipps (2002)\nargues that developers must act in a brokerage role with all staff providing perspec-\ntives that can inform strategic policy and decisions. An example of this brokerage role\nin action might be the collaboration of the Higher Education Staff Development\nAgency with the Disability Rights Commission, The National Bureau for Students\nwith Disabilities, Universities UK, Universities Scotland, Higher Education Wales\nand Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to produce a Staff Development\nGood Practice Guide.1 In addition, the call to involve the advocates of disabled\nstudents in the design of electronic material (Conroy, 2002) might place disability\nofficers in the role of broker.\nAccording to Wenger, the job of brokering is a complex one. It involves processes\nof translation, co-ordination and alignment between perspectives. Brokers need to: \n\u0002 have legitimacy so that they can influence the development of practice;\n\u0002 be able to link practices by facilitating transaction between them; and\n\u0002 be secure in living on the boundaries of practices.\nThe literature review revealed a call to involve advocates of students with disabilities\nin the design of accessible electronic material. Disability officers are commonly cited\nas one such advocate. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Disability\n 58\n \nJ. Seale\n             Officers as a whole group may not be secure enough in their own identity to fulfil this\nbrokerage role at the moment. For example, an inspection of the National Association\nof Disability Officers (NADO) website2 reveals that a fair number of the discussion\npapers and conference abstracts seem to focus on the issue of \u2018professional identity\nand development\u2019 and the difficulties of trying to span different communities.\nSome individual disability officers may be secure enough to live on boundaries of\npractices. Draffen, for example, is a member of NADO and also works for TechDis,\na JISC funded service that aims to be the primary source of information and advice\nfor institutions on the use of ICT to support students and staff with Learning Diffi-\nculties and\/or Disabilities. In her TechDis role Draffan manages an accessibility\ndatabase that provides an on-line resource of information about assistive, adaptive\nand enabling technologies for the UK post-16 education sector. She has also\npublished a number of articles on issues of accessibility and discrimination (e.g.\nDraffen, 2002).\nA constellation of practices\nA further implication of the identification of boundary objects, brokers and boundary\npractices within the learning technology literature is that in searching for an enterprise\nof accessibility, the review may not have identified one community of practice but\nrather a constellation of practices. The term constellation refers to a grouping of stel-\nlar objects that are seen as a configuration even though they may not be particularly\nclose to one another, of the same kind, or of the same size. Wenger explains that there\nare many different reasons that some communities of practice may be seen as forming\na constellation. These include having related enterprises, facing similar conditions,\nhaving members in common and sharing artefacts.\nIn her original review of the literature, Seale (2003) argued that four different\ncommunities or constituencies fall under the broad term \u2018learning technology\ncommunity\u2019 and therefore form a constellation. She defined these communities as: \n\u0002 designers of accessible electronic material: e.g. lecturers, educational developers,\nand technical support staff;\n\u0002 users of accessible electronic material: students with disabilities;\n\u0002 advocates for students with disabilities: e.g. disability officers or co-ordinators; and\n\u0002 disseminators of information about best accessible design practice: e.g. staff\ndevelopers.\nIn defining these communities Seale (2003) argued that all four had a related enter-\nprise, that of \u2018accessibility\u2019; that each faces similar conditions in that they all operate\nin the post-compulsory education environment; that each may have members in\ncommon (e.g. a disability officer could also be involved in staff development); and\nthat each shares artefacts such as SENDA and WCAG. Seale (2003) went on to\nhighlight the potential growth of \u2018boundary practices\u2019 that will link these communities\nin some way So, for example, the call for the involvement of users in the design of\naccessible electronic material suggests a boundary practice for which advocates could\n The development of accessibility practices in e-learning:\n \n59\n              be brokers. The call for the involvement of advocates in dissemination of information\nabout good or best practices suggests a boundary practice for which staff developers\nmay be brokers.\nExploring related communities of practice\nOther communities of practice, besides those identified in this review, have also been\nconcerned with accessibility. Most notably, these include the assistive technology\n(AT) and human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) communities (Akoumianakis &\nStephanidis, 2003). The assistive technology community focuses on the design,\nproduction and evaluation of equipment (including software) that can be used to\nmaintain or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities (Banes &\nSeale, 2002), whilst the HCI community focuses on the design, evaluation and imple-\nmentation of interactive computing systems for human use (Baecker et al., 1995).\nThese communities have longer individual histories than the learning technology\ncommunity but also have a history of sharing ideas, theories and models in order to\naddress access and accessibility issues. It may be therefore helpful for these commu-\nnities to share elements of their tradition and practice with the learning technology\ncommunity.\nOne factor that has drawn the assistive technology and human\u2013computer interac-\ntion communities together has been their shared interest in the principles of universal\ndesign. Products designed using the principles of universal design: \n\u0002 are developed with consideration of the needs of a diverse population;\n\u0002 are not described as being anything more than easy for everyone to use;\n\u0002 are always accessible (but because accessibility has been integrated from the\nbeginning of the design process, they are less likely to be noticeable); and\n\u0002 benefit everyone, not only disabled people (Banes & Seale, 2002).\nAssistive technology and universal design\nIn defining its practice, the assistive technology community distinguishes between\naccessible design, adaptable design and universal design (Story, 1998). Accessible\ndesign meets prescribed code requirements for use by people with disabilities but is\noften achieved by providing separate design features for \u2018special\u2019 user groups. Adapt-\nable design involves making modifications to a standard design for the purpose of\nmaking the design usable for an individual, as needed. Universal design is the design\nof products and environments that can be used and experienced by people of all\nabilities, to the greatest extent possible, without adaptation.\nStory (1998) argues that universal designs are developed with consideration for the\nneeds of a diverse population and therefore do not call attention to themselves as\nbeing anything more than easy for everyone to use. Universal designs are always\naccessible but because they integrate accessibility from the beginning of the design\nprocess, they are less likely to be noticeable (and hence stigmatising). However,\n 60\n \nJ. Seale\n            universal designs may sometimes employ adaptable strategies for achieving customi-\nsation. For these reasons, Story (198) argues that universal designs are the most\ninclusive and least stigmatising of the three types of design. Building on these\narguments, Iwarsson and Stahl (2003) argue that accessible design is based on the\nassumption that designers have to design for two populations: the normal population\nand the abnormal population (people with disabilities). In contrast, universal design\nis based on the assumption that there is \u2018only one population comprised of individuals\nrepresenting diverse characteristics and abilities. Accessible design can therefore be\nstigmatising, whereas universal design can be equalising.\nHuman\u2013computer interaction and universal accessibility\nThe HCI community has embraced universal design to the extent that it has exam-\nined its assumptions about the populations it designs for and in doing so adopted a\nprinciple that has been termed \u2018universal accessibility\u2019 or \u2018universal usability\u2019. In\nexploring this principle, Stephanidis et al. (1998, p. 1) argued that the principle of\ndesigning for the \u2018average\u2019 user would be gradually replaced by the \u201cmore demanding\nand challenging objective of designing to cope with diversity\u201d. They go on to suggest\nthat in seeking to understand in more detail the needs of people with disabilities a\nnew understanding of human interaction will emerge, which will lead to a new gener-\nation of products that \u201cwill be improved in their usability, will be intuitive to use and\nwill be accessible by the broadest possible end-user population\u201d (Stephanidis et al.,\n1998, p. 2).\nIn discussing the impact on the HCI community of the shift in focus to designing\nfor diverse populations, Akoumianakis and Stephanidis (2003, p. 228) outline the\nnature of the challenge and conclude: \nIt becomes compelling that designers\u2019 conception of users should (somehow) accommo-\ndate the requirements of as broad a range as possible, or ultimately all potential citizens,\nincluding the young and the elderly, residential users, as well as those with situational or\npermanent disability.\nLearning technology and universal design\nSome learning technologists, when discussing how to cater for the individual\nneeds of disabled students, argue strongly for what they call \u2018design for each\u2019 and\nreject suggestions that in trying to design for all students the needs of disabled\nstudents will, for the most part, be catered for. Such rejections demonstrate a\nlack of understanding of universal design (design for all) principles and suggest\nthat they would benefit from engaging with the AT and HCI communities, which\nhave drawn heavily on these principles in developing their own design practices.\nBy doing so, learning technologists may be able to develop what Scott et al.\n(2003) call an \u2018integrative approach\u2019 where the focus is shifted away from making\nexceptions for different learners to anticipating and planning for student diversity\nas the norm.\n The development of accessibility practices in e-learning:\n \n61\n      Discussion: towards a rounder practice?\nAn exploration of current practice suggests that learning technologists are perhaps\noverly focused on the product of accessibility practices (e-learning materials and\nresources) rather than the process by which they are produced. There is some\nevidence to suggest however that the focus is gradually shifting from describing or\ndefining the attributes of the end-product (e.g. the accessible web site) towards\ndescribing the process by which these products are developed. To use Wengers\u2019\nterms, this represents a shift from reification to participation.\nVirtual Learning Environments (VLEs) offer a useful illustration of this. Since we\nnow have guidelines for designing accessible VLEs (Pearson & Koppi, 2001) and\ntools for designing VLE interfaces (Smith, 2002) we can perhaps move towards\ndescribing different ways of using VLEs with disabled students (Bradley & Wood-\nford, 2003) as well as exploring different pedagogical approaches to supporting\ndisabled students in their use of VLEs (e.g. the ALERT project3). Such descriptions\nmay contribute to a rounder, fuller picture of accessibility practices. This would\nenable us to define indicators for accessible practices as well as for accessible e-\nlearning materials. Such indicators could then be used to develop an \u2018Index of\nAccessibility\u2019, comparable to the Index for Inclusion produced by the Inclusive\nEducation Community (Booth & Ainscow, 2000). The index for inclusion is a\nresource or tool that invites schools to identify barriers to learning and participation\nand invites them to reduce those barriers by addressing cultures, policies and prac-\ntices (Vaughn, 2002). The review and analysis of accessibility practices in Higher\nEducation in the UK suggests that there may be value in identifying barriers to the\ndesign and implementation of accessible electronic materials (e.g. lack of user\ninvolvement) and exploring how changes or adaptations to cultures, policies or prac-\ntices might reduce these barriers.\nConclusion\nThe application of Wenger\u2019s (1998) theory to the development of accessible e-learning\nhas facilitated an exploration of current practice which suggests that the learning tech-\nnology community might be attempting to develop a practice to deal with what they\nunderstand to the their \u2018enterprise\u2019 and to own that practice despite the perceived\nimposition of laws such as SENDA. The interpretation of Wenger\u2019s concept of\ncommunities of practice as it relates to current e-learning \u201caccessibility practices\u201d in\nHigher Education also suggests some recommendations for the future development\nof these practice: \n1. It may be helpful for the learning technology community to make links with other\nrelated communities in order to identify related practices and explore the extent\nto which these practices may influence the focus or nature of its own practice.\n2. At some point in the near future, the learning technology community might also\nbenefit from shifting its attention away from the product of accessibility towards\nthe process of accessibility.\n 62\n \nJ. Seale\n                                   Engagement with the principles of universal design would be one way of advancing\npractice in line with both of these recommendations.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper is based on a research paper presented at ALT-C 2003 and published in\nthe conference\u2019s research proceedings.\nNotes\n1. http:\/\/www.drc-gb.org\/drc\/Documents\/staff%20development.doc\n2. http:\/\/www.nado.ac.uk\/\n3. www.dur.ac.uk\/lt.team\/alert\nReferences\nAkoumianakis, D. & Stephanidis, C.
