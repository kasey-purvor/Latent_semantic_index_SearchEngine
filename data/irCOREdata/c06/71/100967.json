INTRODUCTION\nSOURCE-GATED TRANSISTORS (SGTs) [1] form a classof transistors in which the current is determined by the mag-\nnitude of the electric field at a reverse biased source barrier. This\nelectric field is controlled using a gate located above or below\nthe barrier. To date, source-gated transistors have only been\nmade in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) [2] where it\nhas been shown that they can have a low saturation voltage, high\noutput impedance and very much better stability than an equiv-\nalent field-effect transistor (FET) [3]. These features in a-Si:H\nmakes the SGT well suited to OLED and PLED pixel drivers\nand small signal analog amplifiers [4].\nWith reference to Fig. 1, electrons will accumulate at the\nsemiconductor-insulator interface when a large positive voltage\nis applied to gate relative to the source. However when a pos-\nitive voltage is applied to the drain the source barrier is re-\nverse biased and source-drain current is determined by elec-\ntron transport across the reverse biased source barrier and its\nfield dependence. Current saturation with drain voltage occurs\nwhen the semiconductor layer under the source barrier is de-\npleted by the reverse biased source barrier. Since this layer is\nthin and lightly doped, saturation voltages are small. When sat-\nuration occurs it is a good approximation to assume that the gate\ninsulator and semiconductor layer behave as two dielectric in\nseries. This dielectric model enables the change in saturation\nvoltage with the gate voltage to be calculated in a straightfor-\nward manner [2]. For drain voltages above saturation the electric\nfield at the source barrier is determined by the magnitude of the\ngate voltage. Therefore we have a situation where the on-cur-\nrent of the device is determined by the reverse biased source\nManuscript received May 26, 2005; revised July 5, 2005.

This is in contrast to a FET where\nan ohmic source region is exposed to the drain field emanating\nfrom the laterally spaced drain contact. The SGT is therefore\nmuch more tolerant to deleterious short channel effects [5].\nHere we are concerned with the SGT in polysilicon (poly-Si)\nwhere the very low saturation voltage at high gate voltages and\nhigh output impedance of the SGT compared with FET should\nprovide attractive benefits for a variety of circuit functions. It is\nshown that indeed these features are found in a poly-Si SGT.\nII. SAMPLE PREPARATION\nSGTs in polysilicon were made by adapting a mask set used\nfor making standard FETs and using a technology based on ex-\ncimer laser crystallization of amorphous silicon. Both top and\nbottom gate structures have been made in the past using and\nexcimer laser [6]\u2013[9] but we chose a bottom gate structure be-\ncause the source barrier was then on the surface and easily ac-\ncessible for barrier modification studies. A top gate structure\ncould be used but the source barrier would need to be under the\npolysilicon and therefore has less flexibility in respect to bar-\nrier control. A schematic cross section of the SGT structure is\nshown in Fig. 1. This structure was far from ideal particularly the\ngate-drain overlap but enabled us to check the basic properties\nof a SGT. The bottom gate structure was made using an excimer\nlaser to crystallize an amorphous silicon layer deposited on top\nof the oxide by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition\n[10]. The thicknesses of the oxide layer and poly-Si layer were\n150 and 40 nm respectively. A field-plate structure to provide\nfield relief at the edge of the Schottky source barrier was made\nby depositing a thin oxide (43 nm thick) on the top of the poly-Si\nand overlapping the source contact metal to form the field plate.\nA Schottky source barrier was formed using chromium backed\n0741-3106\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The n drain region was formed using phos-\nphorus ion implantation through the field plate oxide with the\nsource metal acting as a mask. The source\/barrier gate overlap\nwas nominally fixed at 3 m but the channel length d of the par-\nasitic FET varied between 2 and 60 m. The width w of all the\ndevices was 50 m.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe output characteristics of a poly-Si SGT with a Schottky\nsource barrier is shown in Fig. 2 along with the corresponding\ntransfer curve in Fig. 3. The characteristics have the main fea-\ntures of a SGT, namely a low saturation voltage and high output\nimpedance. The characteristics of bottom-gated FET structures\nwith ohmic source regions showed much lower output imped-\nances and the saturation voltage changed by approximately 1 V\nfor every additional volt on the gate and were similar to these\nfound in top-gated structures [11]. Furthermore the saturation\ncurrent of the SGT at a given gate voltage was independent of\nd, the length of the channel of the parasitic FET (Fig. 4) which\nshows that the current is controlled by the gated source Schottky\nbarrier and the transistor is operating as a SGT. The magni-\ntude of the current depends on the effective barrier height of\nthe source barrier.\nFig. 4. Saturated drain current at V = 10 V through a SGT against\nsource\/drain separation (d). The activation energy of the transport process was\nobtained from the slope of log I versus 1\/kT.\nIt is seen in Fig. 2 that the impedance is high at low drain volt-\nages but it is compromised by the poor performance of the field-\nplate passivation structure and the current increases markedly\nabove V. At low drain voltages impedances exceed\n.\nTypical of SGTs, the saturation voltage is low. With\nV, for example, V which compares with 9 V\nfor a FET . At higher gate voltages increases\nby 0.12 V for every volt on the gate which is higher than the\n0.08 V per 1 V on the gate we expect from the dielectric model\nfor the SGT [2]. This could be due to states at the poly-Si oxide\ninterface. The slow increase in current with the gate voltage in\nthe subthreshold region of the transfer curve (Fig. 3) also sug-\ngests that there are large number of interface states which is not\nsurprising in a laser crystallized bottom gate structure.\nThe activation energy for current transport in the off-state\nV and on-state V is shown in Fig. 4. Since\nthe off-state is controlled by the parasitic FET the value of 0.52\neV is roughly what we would expect since this value is close to\nhalf the band gap of the silicon and consistent with a generation\ncurrent. In the on-state however when the current is determined\nby the reverse-biased Schottky barrier the activation energy\nis very much smaller than expected based on thermionic-field\nemission of electrons through the barrier. Using the known\ntunneling constant for silicon [12] the effective barrier height\nand the activation energy should change by 0.01 eV per volt on\nthe gate but we have measured values five times higher than this.\nA possible explanation is that there is an insulating interfacial\nlayer between the Cr metal and the polysilicon resulting in\na significant contribution to the current from field emission\nof carriers rather than purely thermionic-field emission. The\npresence of an insulating layer would also explain why the\ncurrent is very much lower at V than we expect from\na barrier with an effective barrier height of only 0.17 eV. If\nthe insulating layer was SiO then it would need to be 2\nnm thick to account for the large change in the barrier height.\nThe low activation energy in the on-state has important impli-\ncations because the change of current with temperature is small\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In fact we have measured in some transistors as low\nas 0.08 eV at V.\nThe SGT is well suited to circuits where lower power dissi-\npation is required because it can be operated in saturation at low\ndrain voltages. Of course a FET can also be operated in satura-\ntion at low drain voltages provided the gate voltage is not much\ngreater than the threshold voltage. However it is in this region\nof the FET that the current is most sensitive to small changes in\nthreshold voltage. In contrast, the SGT can be operated at high\ngate voltages well away from the threshold where the effects of\nthreshold variations and instability are negligible, particularly\nsince device stability is sensitive to drain field rather than gate\nfield [11].\nIV. CONCLUSION\nSGTs have been formed in polysilicon made using excimer\nlaser crystallization. SGT behavior in these thin film transistor\nstructures with a Schottky source barrier was verified by the fact\nthat the drain current was independent of the channel length\nof the parasitic FET. The magnitude of the drain current was\ntherefore defined by the effective height of the source barrier\nand its dependence on the electric field induced by the gate.\nThe output characteristics showed the main features of a SGT,\nnamely a low saturation voltage and high output impedance. The\noutput impedance at high drain voltage, however, was severely\ndegraded by the failure of a field-relief passivation region at the\nedge of the Schottky source barrier.\nActivation energy measurements in the on-state showed much\nlower values than expected. The low values could be accounted\nfor by the presence of a thin insulating region at the interface\nbetween the Schottky metal and the poly-silicon. An important\nadvantage of low activation energies is that of a low temperature\ncoefficient for the on-current.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. M. Shannon and E. G.
