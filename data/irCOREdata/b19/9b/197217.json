I see the next chapter\nbeing making films really locally . . . the local film people making films\nto state their case politically or otherwise, to express themselves. (John\nGrierson, quoted in Sussex 1972: 26, 30)\nRegional workshop film-makers of the 1970s and 1980s appropriated\nthe theory and aesthetics of British documentary cinema in specific\nways in their attempt to construct a politically and culturally\nprogressive cinema practice, representing both a change and a\ncontinuation in the values and practices of the British documentary\ntradition. What determined these changes and how the documentary\ntradition, founded in the 1930s by John Grierson, was taken up and\ndeployed will form the basis of the argument of this paper. This will\nbe explored through an analysis of the films and film-making practices\nof the Amber Film Workshop, the first, most significant and longest\nsurviving regional film workshop (up to the point where Theresa\nFitzgerald argues that they \u2018established a model and a working practice\nto which all other . . . workshops [were] being obliged to conform\u2019\n(1988: 169)).\nAmber was formed by a group of students who met while studying\nfilm at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London in 1967. The original\nmembers were Murray Martin, Graham Denham, Peter Roberts and\nLorna Powell, all university graduates from working-class backgrounds,\nand Sirkka Liisa Konttinen from Finland. The group relocated to\nNewcastle in 1969 out of a desire to work outside the structures of\nthe London-based industry in a region that had a strong sense of\nits own identity (Amber 2005: 1). Amber\u2019s stated purpose was to\n387\nJack Newsinger\ndocument traditional regional working-class communities in the North\nEast, a culture that was in decline as traditional manufacturing jobs\ndisappeared and were replaced by low-paid, casualised work in the\nservice sector.\nFrom the outset, Amber fully incorporated an egalitarian structure\nand cross-grade working practice into their formation, each member of\nthe group taking an equal wage. Accordingly, all its films are ascribed\ncollective authorship and made through a process of collaboration.\nIn 1971 Amber rented premises on the Newcastle Quayside, buying\nthe buildings in the late 1970s when the Quayside was threatened\nwith demolition (and later successfully leading a campaign for its\npreservation, which would be the subject of their 1979 film Quayside).\nThe buildings were converted into a film workshop, a cinema and the\nSide photographic gallery. As well as working in film Amber was active\nin photography and the Live Theatre movement, the separate areas\ninforming one another. This integration of activity attracted revenue\nfunding for photography from Northern Arts and film exhibition\nfunding from the BFI, funds which contributed to the film production\nof the period along with money earned from freelance work which was\npooled back into production so as to maintain a degree of financial\nindependence.\nTheir work can be divided into three overlapping phases or strands.\nThe first is the series of short documentaries made in the 1970s\nrecording traditional industrial processes, a type of film that Darren\nNewbury has called \u2018salvage documentary\u2019 (2002: 114). The second\nphase begins in 1983 with Byker and sees the group experimenting with\ndocumentary and fictional or narrative practices. The third strand is\ntheir more explicit campaigning work, particularly that centred on the\nMiners\u2019 Strike (1984\u20135).1 This article is concerned with the first two\nstrands as representing the development of the documentary tradition\nin their work. Up to 2007 the group have made some 40 films, almost\nall of which explore working-class identity in the North East. As Ellin\nHare notes: \u2018All of the films are experiments, and each one has a\nslightly different way of making that interface between documentary\nand fiction\u2019 (Young 2001: 72).\nAmber\u2019s body of work is unique in British cinema through its\nengagement with specific local communities and working-class identity\nin the North East over nearly four decades. Yet where they do appear\nin British cinema history it is normally in relation to the politics of the\nWorkshop Movement. While their key role in the movement certainly\nshould not be understated,2 attention to this has arguably been at the\nexpense of a consideration of their contribution to the theory and\n388\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\npractice of documentary film-making and the representation of the\nNorthern working class in British cinema. Part of the argument in\nthis article is that the existence of regional documentary demands the\nextension of the history of British documentary cinema beyond the\n1960s and Free Cinema.3\nThe argument will proceed first by contextualising Amber\u2019s\ndevelopment within the economic and social conditions of the 1970s\nand 1980s, particularly within the North of England. Then it will\nmove on to Amber itself and the development of documentary practice\nwithin its work, first considering the \u2018salvage documentaries\u2019 and then\nmoving on to its experiments with the documentary form.\nContexts\nIf the documentary movement can be defined by the \u2018social democratic\nconsensus\u2019 \u2013 a belief in the state as a benevolent force for the regulation\nof capitalism combined with an overriding collectivist notion of social\nrelationships within the public sphere \u2013 then the 1960s saw increasingly\nthe growth of cultural practices which were oppositional to the state.\nFor Murray Martin the degree of independence from the agendas of\nthe funding bodies which characterised the regional film production\nsector in the 1970s and 1980s marks a key difference between Amber\u2019s\napproach and that of the 1930s documentarists:\nThe difference between that constituency and us was that in many ways\nthe 1930s filmmakers worked for the state, were employed by it and\ncensored by it. Hence there are no images of unemployment from the\n1930s or at least very few . . . We came from an artistic background but\none with a political dimension. It is a different tangent and a much more\nindependent one. (Beynon 2001: 162\u20133)\nThis \u2018different tangent\u2019 involved the re-articulation of the documen-\ntary impulse to record and communicate ideas about the working class\nwithin an overtly ideological model which stressed class conflict and\ncontradiction.\nThis can be explained by examining the social and political context\nfrom which Amber emerged and, in particular, the changes in the\narticulation of class and region. While, as Darren Newbury notes, \u2018in\nthe early 1970s, working-class institutions such as the trade unions\nrepresented a powerful political force, and working-class identity could\nbe seen in a positive light\u2019 (2002: 114), this changed sharply during\nthe late 1970s, culminating with the election of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s\nConservative government in 1979. Historian Richard Weight describes\na significant redistribution of wealth under Thatcher which manifested\n389\nJack Newsinger\nitself and was experienced in regional terms as an \u2018orgy of prosperity\nin Southern England [which] created a stark \u201cnorth\u2013south\u2019\u2019 divide\u2019.\nThatcher set about dismantling regional spatial subsidies as part\nof her more generalised attack on the welfare state and by 1986\nunemployment in the North of England was sixty per cent higher\nthan in the South (2002: 591\u20132). For Robert Colls this was part of\na change in the character of the North in British social and cultural\nlife, moving the region in national cultural geography from a place\nin need of assistance to a zone far out on the margins as privilege,\nwealth and national identity became concentrated in the South East\n(2002: 332\u20133). As Dave Russell notes, the North\u2013South divide became\na staple of political discourse:\nWhile it is difficult to sustain any reading of \u2018North\u2013South\u2019 relationships\nover the long term in truly colonial terms, it is not surprising that some\npolitically engaged northerners began to view themselves as living under\nprecisely such an arrangement from the 1980s. (2004: 29)\nThis resulted in the consolidation of one image of the North as\nbackward, defined by failed industry and unemployment, and peopled\nby brutish union men and petty criminals. As Raphael Samuel\ndescribes it:\nThe very qualities which had recommended it to the \u2018new wave\u2019\nwriters and filmmakers now served as talismans of narrowness. The rich\nassociational life, such as that of the workingmen\u2019s club, was seen not as\nsupportive but as excluding, a way in which the natives could keep new-\ncomers and strangers at bay . . . The solidarities of the workplace were\nreconceptualised as a species of male bonding, a licence for the subju-\ngation of women; while smokestack industries which had been the pride\nof the North now appeared, retrospectively, as ecological nightmares.\nIn another set of dialectical inversions, the modernisations of the 1960s\nwere stigmatised as planning disasters, imprisoning the local population\nin no-go estates and tower blocks. (Quoted in Russell 2004: 29)\nThese social and political tensions would receive their fullest\nexpression in the 1984\u20135 Miners\u2019 Strike which signalled \u2018a permanent\nshift in the balance of power in British politics\u2019 (Newbury 2002: 114).\nA bitter and violent struggle, it marked the most significant stage of\nThatcher\u2019s strategic assault on traditional working-class institutions\nin Britain, of which the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)\nwas one the largest, best organised and most militant.4 Its effects\nwere particularly harshly felt in the traditionally Labour-supporting\nindustrial heartlands of the North and the Midlands.\n390\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nIn Newcastle, de-industrialisation had begun towards the beginning\nof the twentieth century and accelerated from the late 1960s (Vall 2001:\n47\u201370). This coincided with a large programme of city redevelopment\nunder the Labour administration from 1958, embodied in the \u2018Burns\nPlan\u2019. This included infrastructure development and a comprehensive\nclearance and redevelopment of inner-city housing areas so as to adjust\nthe city\u2019s economy from manufacturing to one based on property\ndevelopment, leisure and consumerism. Newcastle had relatively few\nslum areas; however, for Wilfred Burns, Chief Planning Officer from\n1958, housing clearance had other advantages:\nOne result of slum clearance is that a considerable movement of people\ntakes place over long distances, with devastating effect on the social\ngroupings built up over the years. But, one might argue this is a good\nthing when we are dealing with people who have no initiative or civic\npride. The task, surely, is to break up such groupings even though the\npeople seem to be satisfied with their miserable environment and seem\nto enjoy an extrovert social life in their own locality. (Quoted in Byrne\n2001: 346\u20137)\nCity planning in Newcastle through to the 1980s, as David Byrne notes,\nwas both a technical and sociological project, \u2018the assertion of the form\nof the future\u2019 (ibid.: 344\u20139). That this contained an overt hostility\ntowards the traditional identity of the urban working class in the city is\nabundantly clear.\nSocial, economic and cultural divisions were, therefore, realised\nnationally in the expression of the North\u2013South divide, but also\ninternally in the North in a dichotomy between the politics of tradition\nand \u2018modernisation\u2019. However, Amber\u2019s early work was guided less by a\nreasoned response to cinematic traditions or class politics and more by\na set of feelings incorporating, variously, a non-sectarian leftist critique\nof established institutions and the mainstream media, an attachment\nto and interest in traditional forms of regional working-class identity\nand a desire for artistic expression. Martin, for example, recalling\nthe group\u2019s early motivations, states that \u2018we were conscious that we\nwere creative people who felt that we were making imagery about a\nparticular culture\u2019. He continues: \u2018I felt there was a job to be done of\nrecording working-class culture before it disappeared, and celebrating\nit\u2019 (Newbury 2002: 117, 119). The desire creatively to document and\ncelebrate the working class in Newcastle clearly echoes the aesthetic\nambitions which motivated Grierson. Take this statement, for example:\nWhen we come to documentary we come to the actual world, to the\nworld of streets, of the tenements and the factories, the living people and\n391\nJack Newsinger\nobservation of living people, but I charge you to remember that the task\nof reality before you is not one of reproduction but of interpretation. We\nhave to give creative shape to it, we have to be profound about it before\nour documentary art is as good or better than the art of the studio . . . It\nis only good if its interpretation is a real interpretation, that is to say one\nwhich lights up the fact, which brings it alive, which indicates precisely\nand deeply our human relation to it. (Grierson 1998: 76\u20137)\nHowever, when placed in the context of the late 1970s and early\n1980s, the expression of a traditional regional working-class identity\ncould take on an oppositional cultural politics. Put another way,\nwhile Grierson and the documentary movement constructed the\nrepresentation of the working class within a discourse of public service\nto the state, for Martin and Amber the function of documentary is\nconstructed within a discourse of service to the Northern working class\nwhich stands in opposition to the state:\nWe constantly get into this battle about the representation of the working\nclass . . . I often say Prince Charles can have a cloth cap, but the working\nclasses can\u2019t \u2013 the upper classes understand their traditions, and defend\nthem. The power structure has Black Rod knocking on Parliament\u2019s door,\nto see the MPs through. And all the MPs go and kneel at the Queen\u2019s feet\nand say, \u2018We swear allegiance to you above even our party\u2019, and then join\nthe Privy Council \u2013 all those traditions are fine, but when the working\nclass have a history, like mining, it is erased at a frightening rate. (Young\n2001: 68)\nAmber\u2019s work explores working-class identity in the North East\nduring a period of intense transformation of the identity of the\nregion, with old connotations persisting as well as being contested and\nsupplanted. This is central to the way Amber\u2019s work can be understood.\nIts films chart the response to industrial decline in the region while at\nthe same time dramatising a confrontation between traditional forms\nof working-class identity and \u2018modernisation\u2019. This begins with the\n\u2018salvage documentaries\u2019 of the 1970s, which take up the thematic\nconcerns and aesthetic practices of the documentary movement. From\nthe early 1980s a change is discernible in Amber\u2019s work, which moves\naway from straightforward documentary and into experimentation\nwith the documentary form\u2013 the \u2018interface between documentary and\nfiction\u2019. Concurrent with these developments in scale and ambition,\nthe group developed a coherent operational and ideological model\nfor a regional film workshop with close links to the communities\nwhich formed their subjects and a long-term commitment to the\nexpression of the identity of the region. This was accompanied by\n392\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nthe development of \u2018socially embedded\u2019 film-making practices which\nattempted to overcome some of the perceived limitations inherent in\nthe documentary tradition, in particular the \u2018top-down\u2019 approach to\nthe documentation of working-class culture for which Grierson and his\ncolleagues have been so thoroughly indicted.5 As a result, Amber\u2019s later\nwork moves away from a monolithic construction of regional working-\nclass identity based on industrial labour and masculinity and towards\nmore complex representations based on difference, in terms of gender,\ngeneration and the experience of marginalisation, as the traditional\nmarkers of regional identity became unstable. What follows will trace\nthis development in regional documentary practice.\n\u2018Salvage documentary\u2019\nWith limited funds for film production, Amber\u2019s early work was\nintermittent, combining photography and film. Martin describes the\nproduction of their first film in the early 1970s:\nI remember Sirkka, myself and Pete going out one sunny morning, we\ngot in the car and we drove. We went down to Wallsend where they were\nbuilding one of these giant tankers, and we stood there almost in awe\nof this and said \u2018let\u2019s make a film about this\u2019, you know, to celebrate\nworking people. We wanted to make a film which reflected their pride\nand achievement in making this object. (Newbury 2002: 118)\nThe film in question, Launch (1973), was followed by Bowes Line (1975,\nabout a coal wagon railway), Last Shift (1976, about a brick works) and\nGlass Works (1977). These documentaries can be aligned very closely\nwith the ideas about the social function of the cinema and the aesthetic\nambitions and procedures of the 1930s documentary movement. At\nthe most basic level, the idea of the function of documentary as a\nmeans of recording and communicating ideas about working-class\nculture corresponds to the principles of cinematic practice at the heart\nof the documentary movement. The concern with the appropriate\nvisual imagery with which to communicate these ideas \u2013 the \u2018creative\ninterpretation of reality\u2019, in Grierson\u2019s oft-quoted phrase \u2013 places the\nfilms squarely within the boundaries of the documentary tradition.\nMartin\u2019s repeatedly expressed enthusiasm for the iconic markers of\nworking-class identity, the achievements of working-class culture in\nthe region, echo Grierson\u2019s own enthusiasm for the \u2018hero worker\u2019, the\n\u2018ardour and bravery of common labour\u2019 (quoted in Colls and Dodd\n1985: 24).\n393\nJack Newsinger\nAll the films focus on work, with Last Shift and Glass Works looking to\npre-mechanised industrial processes. Within this there is an emphasis\non the detail of the craft skills of the workers and on their working\nconditions. With the exception of Launch they do not look outside\nthe immediate context of production or attempt to place the workers\nand products as part of a wider social system. In this way the subjects\nfunction as roles and are fully integrated with the processes which\nthe films depict. Taken together they construct regional working-\nclass identity based on the iconic markers of industrialism: physicality,\ncraftsmanship, collectivity and masculinity.\nStylistically the films are unobtrusive and distanced, free from\ncommentary or characterisation. This deliberate refusal to editorialise\nleaves their meanings relatively open, highlighting the aesthetic\nqualities of the images. They are constructed through montage\ntechniques which emphasise composition, rhythm and movement,\nwith the processes functioning as spectacle and rendered abstract.\nIn this way they can be viewed as celebrations or romanticisations\nof regional identity based on maleness and industry and which\nis mediated through an \u2018art\u2019 aesthetic. However, if they continue\nin the aesthetic tradition of the documentary movement \u2013 the male\nworker as hero \u2013 the films also reveal a politics at odds with the\ndocumentary movement\u2019s social-democratic tendencies. This can be\nexplored through a more detailed analysis of Launch.\nLaunch was shot in the early 1970s when Amber was given access to a\nshipyard directly backing onto a street in Wallsend. The film shows the\nconstruction of the World Union oil tanker and its eventual departure\nfrom the yard. It is a series of short (the film was shot using a wind-\nup Bolex 16mm camera with a maximum shot duration of twenty\nseconds) wide-angle composition shots animated by the movement of\nheavy machinery and men at work, and finishing with Princess Anne\nand local dignitaries christening the launch and an extended sequence\nof the view from between the terraced houses as the completed ship\nmoves out towards the sea.\nThe film is defined by industry: heavy machinery, steam and noise.\nWe see the ship constructed, welded and painted, and are shown the\nscale of the endeavour. The focus is on processes, and frequently the\nworkers are not fully in shot or are out of focus, the industrial site\nbecoming the subject of the film. There is a concern with the sociality\nof the workplace, shown in several close-ups of men smoking and\nlaughing, but no individual characterisation.\nThe shots are carefully composed and mostly static, with a\nconsiderable emphasis on scale, light\/shadow and movement. This\n394\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nsense of the aesthetic qualities of the industrial is further emphasised\nby editing which undercuts a narrative dynamic. While there is\nattention to the detail of the work, there is little explanation or attempt\nto communicate information about what is happening and why. In this\nway, the processes are removed from the context of industrial labour\nrelations and rendered as spectacle, finishing with the shot of the ship\nmoving out to sea which completes the film. Like the other Amber\nfilms in this series, Launch integrates industrial labour and working-\nclass identity.\nThe final part of the film shows women and children emerging\nfrom the tightly lined terraced houses to witness the christening of\nthe ship. Again the camera remains distant, observing interactions\nwithout characterisation. The community line a wall to watch the\nlaunch and the camera assumes their point of view, observing through\na glass barrier the dignitaries approaching the ship. Ultimately the\nworkers and their families are excluded from the ceremony. In this final\nsequence, then, there is a concern to represent class divisions which\nundercut the aesthetic practices of the first part of the film.\nThis dual concern with visual celebration and social critique can\nbe seen in the other \u2018salvage documentaries\u2019, all of which look at\ntraditional industrial processes on the verge of disappearance. That\nthe dramatisation of this dichotomy is part of a political response to\nde-industrialisation is made explicit by Graeme Rigby, another Amber\nmember:\nPeople might dismiss that as romanticising the landscape of industrial\nculture. It\u2019s probably more important to realise that this is actually\nwhat\u2019s been taken away from people\u2019s lives. This is a whole dimension\nwithin which they found identity, an identity in which they could feel\nproud. You take that away and people\u2019s lives are diminished and that\nshould be acknowledged. (Interview with the author, 2007; all subsequent\nquotations from Rigby are taken from this source)\nMany of the thematic concerns and aesthetic practices present in\nAmber\u2019s documentaries of the 1970s are continued in its subsequent\nwork: the representation and celebration of working-class culture, a\nvisual interest in the industrial landscape of the North East as central\nto regional identity and a conception of decline. In particular, the\ntension between aestheticism and a commitment to the representation\nof the working class can be seen as a significant continuity between\nAmber and the documentary tradition. The tension between \u2018an artists\u2019\ncollective but with a commitment to the working class\u2019 has been\nrecognised by Martin as a \u2018strain within Amber\u2019s work in making\n395\nJack Newsinger\ncreative documentaries, which takes you back to the tensions in the\n1930s documentary movement\u2019 (Beynon 2001: 162). Indeed, the move\naway from straightforward documentary practices from the 1980s\nonwards can be seen in large measure as the working through of this\ntension.\nThe interface of documentary and fiction\nSeveral interlinked factors contributed to the transition in Amber\u2019s\nwork to film-making practices which experimented with the\ndocumentary form. Firstly, Amber\u2019s combination of work in theatre,\nphotography and film, all in relation to specific working-class\ncommunities in the North East, led to the development of long-term\nrelationships with those communities. This presented the opportunity\nfor more detailed research and documentation over longer periods. At\nthe same time, this combination of activity informed the development\nof film-making practices which actively involved documentary subjects\nin the process of constructing meaning, moving into fictional drama\nand dramatic reconstruction. While this could be seen as a break\nwith the documentary tradition, for Amber it was characterised as\nan extension of their project of regional documentation which \u2018gives\ngreater flexibility, makes a depth of exploration possible and opens\nup a completely different relationship with the communities in which\nthe work is developed\u2019 (Amber 2005: 19). For Graeme Rigby, the\nemployment of fictional drama is \u2018experimenting in the relationship\nbetween documentary, community and fiction\u2019. It can, then, be seen\nas part of an attempt to address the tension between aestheticism and\ncommitment realised at a formal level. For example, Murray Martin\nargues that \u2018it was really acting, using working-class people acting and\nsaying what they wanted to. And this not only made [the films] more\npoetic but also more emotionally accessible\u2019 (Beynon 2001: 163). The\nway in which this in turn informed the thematic concerns present in\nAmber\u2019s work can be seen in Martin\u2019s account of the production of\nHigh Row:\nI worked with a writer called Eric Northey. We were there for about a\nmonth, working in the mine. That was part of the romance, we actually\nwent and did a job there as part of the research. What we said as we wrote\nthe script was that the work is dangerous and claustrophobic, because you\ncrawl down the hole basically and the roof falls in all the time, and you\ncan\u2019t see underground. But when we showed the script to the men, they\nsaid, \u2018if you think that, you\u2019re not a miner\u2019. Their view of themselves was\nromantic . . . So we re-wrote the script and made a film which reflected\n396\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nwhat they thought about themselves . . . So it\u2019s an interesting process, and\nthat process has always been part of reflecting what people think, taking\nit back to them and having that debate, it\u2019s part of the recording of that\nculture. (Newbury 2002: 119)\nAmber\u2019s documentary practice sought actively to construct subjective\nagency within the film-making process and in particular within the\ndocumentary form. As Graeme Rigby argues:\nThe key thing is to do with going into the community and genuinely\ncreating the film out of that engagement rather than imposing your\nnarrative on that. And if you\u2019re trying to develop something genuine\nout of that engagement it is necessarily experimental.\nThe move into fictional drama is thus articulated as part of Amber\u2019s\nattempt to develop a \u2018socially embedded\u2019 film-making practice. The\nnotion of socially embedded film-making corresponds very closely with\nthe conception of cinema as a social practice which Sylvia Harvey\nargues defined the independent film sector in Britain during the\nperiod, that is cinema as a \u2018cycle of production and consumption which\nis concerned with the joint production of meaning by both producer\nand consumer, and motivated by cultural rather than commercial\nconsiderations\u2019 (1981: 14). This is put another way by Amber member\nPat McCarthy:\nIt\u2019s a grassroots involvement in saying \u2018the media should belong to you,\nyou should influence it.\u2019 Basically, what we\u2019re saying to people is that it\u2019s\nan area you should be involved in. It\u2019s not something that should be done\nat you. (Quoted in Fitzgerald 1988: 164)\nThe 1980s was a period of extraordinary productivity for Amber.\nByker was followed by Keeping Time (1983), The Sadler Story (1985),\nSeacoal (1985), Double Vision (1986), T. Dan Smith (1987), From Marks\nand Spencers to Marx and Engels (1988), Shields Stories (1988) and In\nFading Light (1989). However, from the early 1990s Channel Four,\nthe BFI and the Arts Council withdrew funding from the Workshop\nsector and shifted priorities toward output made under traditional\ncommissioning and production arrangements. This is reflected in\nAmber\u2019s reduced output of the period: Dream On (1991), The Writing\nin the Sand (1991), Eden Valley (1994), Letters to Katja (1994), The Scar\n(1997), Like Father (2001) and Shooting Magpies (2005).\nAll the above-mentioned films contain elements which can be said\nto blend documentary with fictional drama or narrative production\npractices. Within this blend, various thematic, formal and aesthetic\n397\nJack Newsinger\nmediating techniques are used. For example, Byker, Keeping Time, The\nWriting in the Sand, Letters to Katja and T. Dan Smith are the most\nformally experimental, constructed through both \u2018pure\u2019 documentary\nand reconstruction. With the exception of T. Dan Smith, these films\nall employ still as well as moving images. Seacoal, In Fading Light,\nDream On, The Scar, Like Father and Shooting Magpies are all classically\nstructured feature-length films with central protagonists, dramatic\nconceits and ultimate narrative resolution. They employ a combination\nof documentary, reconstruction, improvisation and fictional practices.\nThis blurs the distinction between documentary subject and actor, with\na core of regular actors drawn from Live Theatre and the local area\nappearing in many of Amber\u2019s films alongside non-professional actors\ndrawn from local communities.\nThematically there is an overriding emphasis on the experience\nof de-industrialisation and decline in the region. There is also a\ncontinued interest in work as central to working-class identity, with\nIn Fading Light, Dream On, The Scar and Like Father all addressing the\ndecline of traditional industries (in these instances, fishing and coal\nmining). If regional planners in the 1980s and 1990s sought to erase\nand disavow the North East\u2019s industrial heritage, then for Amber it\nwas still a key symbol of its identity. However, the relationship between\nwork and identity is frequently portrayed as complex and ambivalent,\nas opposed to integrated and celebratory, with the romanticisation\nof industrial labour repeatedly undercut by the depiction of harsh\nconditions, precarious employment and conflict. From the beginning\nof the 1980s their films foreground a whole series of ambivalent\nrelationships between regional communities, industrial history, social\nchange and internal difference. The pre-eminence of these elements\nin their later work is explicitly linked by Martin to the defeat of the\nminers in 1985:\nYou could celebrate the achievements pre-1984 because they\u2019d gone\nunrecognised. You could celebrate the fact that people had built a huge\nship, however they were treated, or the monumental impact of working\nin the steelworks. On the one hand it destroyed your health, on the other\nit gave you a monumental identity.\nHe continues:\nThe mining culture had that parameter of brutalization at one end,\nhorrific treatment of people and of each other, and a totally humanist\nbase at the other . . . It\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about dignity and\nthe belief in the work you do and the status you have . . . Post Miners\u2019\n398\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nStrike we\u2019ve been looking even more at the demise of what one would\ncall working-class culture and at the same time being more and more\ndragged into periphery cultures. (Newbury 2002: 122)\nThese ideas inform the construction of work and working-class identity\nin their films throughout the period. At the same time, there is a\nrepeated concern to document sociality and leisure \u2013whether it be pub\nsinging, harness racing or the camaraderie of the workplace \u2013 as a rich\nand vibrant part of working-class life. Often this is contrasted with\ncolder, less inclusive social relationships which define modernisation\nin the region.\nAs well as the concern in these films with exploring the challenge to\ntraditional working-class masculinity posed by de-industrialisation, a\nsignificant departure from the thematic concerns of the documentary\ntradition is the focus on women in many of the post-1980 films, and in\nparticular on female experience, gender difference and inequality. In\nFading Light, for example, centres on a woman\u2019s attempt to join the\nhighly masculine world of the fishing industry and on the hostility\nwhich she encounters both from the men on board ship and the\nwomen ashore. Similarly Dream On explores the personal lives of three\nmembers of a women\u2019s darts team and their struggle to overcome\ndomestic violence, abuse and alcoholism.\nMany of these themes can be further explored through a more\ndetailed analysis of a specific film. Seacoal is a good example as Amber\u2019s\nfirst feature-length film. In common with much of Amber\u2019s other\nwork, it grew from a photography project to document the seacoaling\ncommunity at Lynemouth which made their living collecting waste coal\nwashed ashore and selling it to a contractor for recycling. In the early\n1980s Amber bought a caravan on the seacoalers\u2019 campsite, and this\nhoused the production team on and off for a period of two years while\nthe film was researched and shot. The film is constructed through the\nactual events at the camp during this period combined with a fictional\nnarrative written by Tom Hadaway (Amber 2005: 13). Seacoal thus\nmixes documentary footage with fictionalised scenes using actors and\nreconstructions with actors and local people.6 The story concerns Betty\n(Amber Styles) and her daughter who escape a violent relationship to\nlive in a caravan with Ray (Ray Stubbs), a seacoaler who has returned\nto the camp after a period working elsewhere. As an outsider, Betty has\nto adjust to the harsh conditions of life on the beach and the prejudices\nof the local people towards the seacoalers. The action is framed by the\nMiners\u2019 Strike, which puts pressure on the seacoalers, and the decision\nby the company which owns the beach to remove them. Ray stockpiles\n399\nJack Newsinger\ncoal in anticipation of a price rise in response to the strike, part of an\nattempt to buy his own horse and cart so as to escape the exploitative\nconditions imposed by the company. Ray then loses his coal in a bet\nand, after an argument with Betty, leaves the camp. The film finishes\nwith Betty choosing to remain on the beach and attempt to earn a\nliving without Ray.\nAccording to Amber\u2019s catalogue:\nThe inspiration for Seacoal undoubtedly came from the staggering\nvisual location in which it is filmed; the industrial landscape of power\nstation and pit framing the blackened beach of Lynemouth where, for\ngenerations, local people and travellers have made their living from\ncollecting waste coal washed ashore. (http:\/\/www.amber-online.co.uk)\nThis aesthetics of the beach and its industrial backdrop are repeatedly\nreturned to in the film, portrayed as both severe and beautiful. This\ndual construction of the landscape is reflected in Ray and Betty\u2019s\nattitude toward their surroundings, with Ray valuing it in terms of\nfreedom and beauty while Betty comments on dirt and deprivation.\nThis landscape is central to the identity of the community, constructing\na dualism that is present throughout the film on both an aesthetic and\nthematic level.\nAgain, work is central to identity and there is considerable\nattention placed on visually recording the detail of the work of the\nseacoalers through a combination of montage and description: sifting\nand shovelling coal, using horse-drawn carts to transport it, being\ndependent on the tide. The work is physical and gruelling but not\nentirely male-dominated. It offers a certain freedom and a harmony\nwith nature which is attractive to Ray and is in this way romanticised.\nAt the same time, the work is placed in the context of the economic\nexploitation of the seacoalers by the company, Betty describing it as\n\u2018slave labour\u2019. This is accompanied by a concern to show and describe\nthe poverty in which the seacoalers live: the lack of running water, the\nrubbish on the beach, shortage of money, unsuccessful negotiations\nwith benefits agencies, and so on. But the film contrasts this with\nBetty\u2019s life in an abusive marriage on a nearby housing estate and\nultimately celebrates the self-determination and community spirit on\noffer on the beach. However, the narrative resolution of the film leaves\neven this conclusion uncertain, refusing fully to endorse the seacoalers\u2019\nway of life.\nThere is also considerable attention paid to communicating the\nsociality of the camp: camp fires, music, the pub, gambling and\nharness racing. In this film, sociality and community are just as\n400\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nsignificant markers of the community\u2019s identity as is labour, and the\ncamaraderie and support offered by local women are central to Betty\u2019s\ndecision to stay in the camp. However, the community is also shown\nto be internally divided, with the seacoalers in competition with each\nother for resources. This theme is advanced through Ray\u2019s rivalry with\nanother seacoaler who eventually wins his coal, leading to his depar-\nture. Capitalist production relations are, therefore, integral to the\ninternal life of the community as opposed to an insidious outside force.\nThe film uses a number of devices to communicate these\nambivalences, some of which can be said to be documentary practices\nand some which are more in keeping with fiction film-making. For\nexample, an extended central sequence shows Betty being accepted\nby the community, and particularly Rosie (Rosie Laidlaw, a non-\nprofessional actor) who introduces her to life on the beach. In this\nsequence documentary footage is interspersed with dialogue between\nBetty, Rosie and other seacoalers, building a documentation of the\ncommunity. In this sense, Betty\u2019s character functions as a mediating\nfigure who facilitates the expression of experience by the seacoalers\nthemselves. Considerable space is given to Rosie and her family to\nconstruct their own identities at the same time as the film records the\nlandscape and the activities taking place within it. This integration of\ndocumentary subject with actor forms the basis of much of Amber\u2019s\nfilm-making practice and was first developed here in Seacoal through\nan agreement with the actors union, Equity. While the actors\u2019 lines were\nscripted, the agreement stipulated that the non-actors could not be\nscripted or directed by Amber, so forcing this approach on the group\n(Amber 2005: 13).\nThese documentary practices are integrated with fictional narrative\ndevices. For example, early in the film a sub-plot is introduced in which\na friend of Ray\u2019s, Ronnie (Sammy Johnson), has left the beach, taken a\nmanager\u2019s job with the company and moved to a nearby village. This\nputs his interests at odds with those of his friend and the rest of the\ncommunity. Ronnie is a symbol of social change and modernisation,\nembracing business and self-interest at the expense of solidarity and\nfreedom. While this is portrayed with some sympathy, with Ronnie\u2019s\nchoice appearing rational in the face of the decline of the seacoalers\u2019\nway of life, ultimately the film laments the loss of a traditional regional\nculture in which local people have for generations held common land\nrights which are now under threat from privatisation. Similarly, the\nromance between Ray and Betty allows the film to explore gender\nrelationships and identity. The couple are supportive and in conflict\nin equal measure, arguing about money and work but also working\n401\nJack Newsinger\ntogether and sharing childcare. Finally, economic conditions prompt\nRay to leave, with Betty becoming empowered by the informal female\nsupport network at the camp. Female experience is thus placed at the\ncentre of the film. While the iconic markers of masculinity in relation to\nlabour are present, the gender division between provider and nurturer\nis destabilised with Betty\u2019s decision to work for herself as a seacoaler.\nSeacoal can be considered a sophisticated exploration of a thematic\ndualism between the \u2018brutalisation\u2019 and \u2018humanism\u2019 that Martin\ndescribes as central to the identity of the region from the 1980s. This\nthematic ambivalence, combined with the mixture of documentary and\nnarrative production practices, constructs a complex documentation of\na regional community. Finally, the use of the device of the outsider\nentering the community is repeatedly employed in Amber\u2019s films\nfrom the early 1980s. While this functions in part as a way of\ncommunicating with the audience through exposition, it can also be\nseen as the symbolic dramatisation of the encounter between the artist\nand the documentary subject, a formal dramatisation of the tension\nbetween aestheticism and commitment that lies at the heart of Amber\u2019s\nencounter with the documentary movement. This point has been put\nforward by Tobias Hochscherf and James Leggott, who argue:\nAmber\u2019s films can be read as a kind of commentary on this tradition,\nin that their films acknowledge, address and even dramatise some of\nthe perceived problems with realist practice. Recurring debates around\nissues of authenticity, romanticism and, in particular, intervention and\nadaptation, are woven into the very fabric of the films themselves, thus\ncircumventing, perhaps, some of the alleged pitfalls of this kind of\nfilmmaking. (forthcoming)\nThis thematic device coexists with the mediating aesthetic practices of\nthe \u2018salvage documentaries\u2019 as a way of addressing the tension between\naestheticism and commitment in documentary practice. Amber\u2019s\nexperiments with the documentary form in films such as Seacoal thus\naddress, on a thematic, formal and structural level, tensions within\nthe documentary tradition. The frequency with which these themes\nare interrogated across Amber\u2019s filmography is striking and suggests a\ncoherent response both to cinematic traditions and to personal artistry\nwhich could imply an auteurist approach even as this is denied by the\nfilm-makers themselves.\nConclusion\nIt is tempting to see the \u2018salvage documentaries\u2019 of the 1970s as\nsimply precursors of Amber\u2019s film-making from the 1980s onwards.\n402\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nWhile in a sense this is the case, it should also be noted that Amber\u2019s\nwork developed within certain institutional and structural constraints\nwhich determined the level of ambition possible in its work. As Martin\nhas argued: \u2018You can\u2019t make the sort of films we make within the\nmainstream tradition. That\u2019s fact\u2019 (Young 2001: 74). The development\nof institutional support for the regional workshop movement and\nthe incorporation of their values, to a certain degree, within that\nsupport network enabled Amber to build and maintain a sophisticated,\nvaried but also coherent exploration of regional identity and the\nnature of documentary representation. From the mid-1980s onwards\nthis support has been in steady decline, supplanted by commercially\noriented funding and commissioning policies which relegate issues of\nculture and identity to secondary or incidental importance. In this\ncontext, the vision of a regionally based, socially responsive cinema\nis well worth reiterating. In the words of Pat McCarthy:\nWe have always been driven by cultural rather than commercial concerns,\nand have never sought to be part of the mainstream of the industry. Our\nagenda has been concerned with establishing film as an \u2018art\u2019 form that\nhas particular relevance to working-class people, and breaking through\nthe cultural snobbery that sees film as somehow inferior to other art\nforms such as theatre, music, ballet and painting. We have campaigned\nfor public funding of a filmmaking that is dedicated to the representation\nof regional cultures, and for the establishment of an alternative cultural\nfilm production, distribution and exhibition network; a national cinema\nthat reflects and explores our national identity and regional filmmaking\nthat reflects its diversities. (2002: 26)\nWhile, as has been argued, Amber is an exemplar of workshop practice,\nit is also unique: the only regional film workshop to survive beyond the\n1990s. As Graeme Rigby notes:\nIf you asked me to date, I think the Miners\u2019 Strike actually created the\nchange. I think after the Miners\u2019 Strike the funding bodies stepped\nback from that kind of thing. At the time I personally don\u2019t think the\nConservative government gave a toss about what was coming out of the\narts \u2013 it was too small . . . But I think the arts were constantly keen to\npresent themselves in a new way and that new way that was very much\nabout making the case that they were economic; it was about supporting\nthe national economy through culture and things like that. And that\ntrend has continued and what we get now is that film presents what it is\ndoing . . . as generating a vibrant industry . . . It is more that we no longer\nfit the structure that has become the necessary structure. We work in a\ndifferent way.\n403\nJack Newsinger\nAs if to mirror this trajectory, Amber\u2019s films, when taken as a whole,\nchart a narrative of decline in the North East. If the 1970s was a period\nof the celebration of regional working-class identity, then in the 1980s\nthis celebration becomes more complex and ambivalent, repeatedly\nreturning to the themes of de-industrialisation and defeat. Shooting\nMagpies, released in 2007, might be said to represent the lowest point\nof this regional decline. Made on a shoestring, budget the film mixes\ndocumentary and reconstruction to chart a community dealing with\nthe devastation wreaked by a generation of young people who have\nknown only unemployment.\nAmber\u2019s body of work is unique in British cinema through its\ncoherent engagement with the North East over nearly four decades,\nand in this sense represents a theoretically informed attempt to\ncontinue in the footsteps of the British documentary movement first\nconceived by Grierson in the 1930s.\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks are due to Graeme Rigby of the Amber Film Workshop for agreeing to\nbe interviewed for this article. Thanks are also due to Tobias Hochscherf for generously\nproviding me with his forthcoming chapter on Amber.\nNotes\n1. Amber\u2019s most significant campaigning work was centred on the independent media\ncampaign in support of the Miners\u2019 Strike, part of wider involvement from the\nindependent film sector. News From Durham and Where Are We Going (1983) was the\nfirst in a series of films made by Amber\u2019s \u2018current affairs unit\u2019 which covered the\nbuild up to and aftermath of the strike in different ways. Beyond the Vote (1984), for\nexample, covered the Chesterfield by-election of March 1984 and shows a growing\ncrossover between the politics of industrial action and the anti-nuclear and peace\nmovements, explored in more detail in Can\u2019t Beat it Alone (1985). Both films were\nmade for Channel 4\u2019s Eleventh Hour programme stream. Amber also worked on the\nwidely celebratedMiners\u2019 Campaign Tapes, a project coordinated by the London-based\nworkshop Platform Films to bring together material recorded by film workshops\nfrom across the country to counteract the mainstream media\u2019s hostility to the strike.\nThe films won the prestigious John Grierson Award in1985 and have recently been\nreleased on DVD by the British Film Institute.

Amber, and particularly Murray Martin, were active in the Association of\nCinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians (ACTT) and the Independent\nFilmmakers\u2019 Association (IFA), and played a central role in negotiating the\ngroundbreaking (but now defunct) Workshop Declaration, securing them revenue\nfunding. For full details of this see Dickinson (1999: 46\u201374).\n3. This has been tentatively advanced by Andrew Higson (1986: 96) and Ian Aitken\n(1998: 61).\n4. It is now widely known, though perhaps not as widely as it should be, that the\nconfrontation with the NUM was a key stage of the \u2018Ridley Plan\u2019, conceived before\n404\nThe Interface of Documentary and Fiction\nThatcher came to power, to take on and defeat the unions one by one, starting\nwith the weaker ones and moving on to the strongest, thus breaking the working-\nclass power base and so paving the way for the radical economic restructuring of\nthe British economy along \u2018free market\u2019 lines. The plan was leaked to the Economist\n(Anon. 1978) and in the context of the Miners\u2019 Strike is discussed in Beynon (1985)\nand Winterton (1989).\n5. Aitken, for example, comments: \u2018Despite the populist rhetoric he often employed,\nGrierson\u2019s work and ideas were aimed, consciously or unconsciously, at the\nmiddle-class audience who read the minority journals and watched educational\nor \u201cinterest\u2019\u2019 films. This posed a contradiction which he was never able to\nadequately resolve . . . the documentary movement was primarily dedicated to the\ncommunication of ideas to governing elites and intellectuals\u2019 (1990: 173).\n6. Interestingly, Rigby notes that with \u2018a film like Seacoal, one of the reasons for pushing\nit to drama is that a lot of the people working on Seacoal were working in the black\neconomy. By fictionalising it you give them some protection\u2019.\nReferences\nAitken, I. (1990), Film and Reform: John Grierson and the Documentary Film Movement,\nLondon: Routledge.\nAitken, I.
