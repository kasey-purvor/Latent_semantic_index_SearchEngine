The present study examined \nhow characteristics of the daily work context related to employees\u2019 resistance to change \nthrough aspects of the change process. The results supported the research model, showing that \nthe relationships of LMX and perceived development climate with employees\u2019 resistance to a \nmerger were fully mediated by three change process characteristics (i.e., information, \nparticipation, and trust in management). In addition, two individual-level characteristics (i.e., \nopenness to job changes, and organizational tenure) showed significant relationships with \nresistance to change. Employees\u2019 role breadth self-efficacy was not related to resistance. \nTogether, the results suggest a number of ways in which organizations can increase the \neffectiveness of their change efforts. \n \n \nKeywords: Organizational change, resistance to change, LMX, development climate, change \nprocess \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          2 \n \nDaily Work Contexts and Resistance to Organizational Change: \nThe Role of Leader-Member Exchange, Perceived Development Climate,  \nand Change Process Characteristics \n \nUnderstanding employees\u2019 reactions to a planned organizational change is an \nimportant concern for many organizations. Swift environmental and technological changes \nhighlight the need for organizations to continually engage in adaptation processes and \norganizational changes. To realize intended changes, organizations must rely on the \ncooperation of their employees (Porras & Robertson, 1992). Resistance to change can \nseverely hamper the change process (Miller, Johnson, & Grau, 1994; Piderit, 2000) and has \nbeen associated with negative outcomes such as decreased satisfaction, productivity, and \npsychological well-being, and increased theft, absenteeism, and turnover (Bordia, Hunt, \nPaulsen, Tourish, & DiFonso, 2004; Miller et al., 1994).  \nOver the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the psychological processes \nthat are involved in employees\u2019 experiences of organizational change (Oreg, 2006; Schyns, \n2004; Stanley, Meyer, & Topolnytsky, 2005; Van Dam, 2005). Extant studies tie employees\u2019 \nreactions to change to characteristics of the change process, such as management\u2019s provision \nof information concerning the change, and the extent to which employee participation is \nenabled (e.g., Wanberg & Banas, 2000). Less attention has been given to the daily work \ncontext within which changes take place. However, the daily context may be crucial for the \nsuccess of change efforts because this is ultimately where the implementation of change \nprograms takes place and where leaders, as change agents, face their followers (cf. Bommer, \nRich, & Rubin, 2005). Context characteristics, such as leadership and organizational climate \nare likely to affect how change is implemented, and consequently, how employees react to \nchange. Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to examine how characteristics of the daily \nwork context are related to employees\u2019 attitudes towards a large scale organizational change.   \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          3 \n \nThe present paper goes beyond previous works on reactions to change in several \nrespects. First, and contrary to extant studies, the focus of our investigations is on the \nimmediate context within which people work. Our primary aim is to examine how \ncharacteristics of the daily work situation, as reflected in the form of the leader-member \nexchange (LMX) relationship and in perceptions of the development climate, are related to \nemployees\u2019 resistance to an organizational change. \nSecond, studies of reactions to change are typically restricted to the study of direct \nrelationships between antecedents and employee reactions. Contrarily, we propose the process \nthrough which employees\u2019 daily context relates to their reactions to change. More specifically, \nwe suggest that the daily work context may have implications for the way in which the change \nprocess is implemented and perceived. In other words, we suggest that the daily context may \nbe associated with employees\u2019 change reactions indirectly, through the change process. \nThird, whereas most studies have focused on relatively small and narrow sets of \nvariables, in the present study we incorporate a range of variables that have been indicated as \nmeaningful to the understanding of employee reactions to change. In addition to context and \nprocess characteristics, we consider how personal characteristics, such as attitude toward job \nchanges and role breadth self-efficacy, may affect how employees react to changes. Beyond \nestablishing the relevance of each variable, their joint examination allows for a comparison of \neach variable\u2019s relative contribution.  \nFrom both theoretical and practical viewpoints, it is important to understand how \ncharacteristics of the daily work context impact employees\u2019 reactions to change. The \nanticipated insights are likely to help organizations better prepare for upcoming changes, and, \nby paying attention to aspects of the daily work situation, organizations could potentially \nprevent or circumvent employees\u2019 resistance to changes.  \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          4 \n \nFinally, as in other organizational studies, work on reactions to change has been \nconducted primarily in the United States. Our study extends extant knowledge by studying \nreactions to change among employees of a large Dutch corporation. \nResistance to Organizational Change \nEmployees\u2019 reactions to change are considered critical for the success of change \nefforts (Armenakis, Harris, & Mossholder, 1993; Piderit, 2000). While the failure of a planned \norganizational change may be due to many factors, few are as important as employees\u2019 \nreactions to the change (Coch & French, 1948). Accordingly, change efforts that take \nemployees\u2019 reactions into account may prevent resistance to the change from developing, \nwhile at the same time may enhance employees\u2019 psychological well-being (Bordia et al., \n2004; Fugate, Kinicki, & Scheck, 2002).  \nNevertheless, empirical research on the psychological processes involved in \norganizational change is only recent. Until the 1990s, research dealing with organizational \nchange has typically taken a macro, systems-oriented, approach (Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, & \nWelbourne, 1999). Only in the last decade researchers have begun to study the psychological \nprocess of change, using a variety of approaches to understanding employees\u2019 reactions to \nchange. Some researchers focused on employees\u2019 resistance to the organizational changes \n(Oreg, 2006; Stanley et al., 2005), while others focused on openness to proposed changes \n(Miller et al., 1994; Wanberg & Banas, 2000). Yet, despite a different frame \u2014 either \u2015for\u2016 or \n\u2015against\u2016 the change \u2014 most researchers refer to these change reactions in a similar manner, \nequating openness to change either explicitly (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002; Miller et al., \n1994) or implicitly (Wanberg & Banas, 2000) with the opposite of resistance to change. In \naddition, researchers of both perspectives have searched for relevant and similar antecedents \nof employees\u2019 reactions to change. In the present study, we focus on the negative experiences \nthat often accompany change. We therefore adopt a \u2015resistance\u2016 frame, although we believe \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          5 \n \nour findings could be translated to an understanding of change acceptance in a relatively \nstraightforward manner.  \nA review of past empirical research reveals that resistance to change has been \nconceptualized in three ways: as a cognitive state, an emotion, and a behavioral intention \n(Piderit, 2000). For instance, research has shown that employees may develop a negative \nposture towards organizational change, thus forming negative interpretations of the change \n(Armenakis et al., 1993; Stanley et al., 2005). Other studies addressed employees\u2019 affective \nreactions, such as feeling agitated, anxious and even depressed as a result of planned \norganizational changes (Bordia et al., 2004). Finally, some studies explored employees\u2019 overt \nbehavioral resistance to change, ranging from expressions of concern to their peers or \nsupervisors, to more severe actions such as slowdowns, strikes, or sabotage (Armenakis et al., \n1993). Because each of these different conceptualizations has its merits, we consider \nresistance to change to be a multidimensional attitude consisting of cognitive, affective, and \nbehavioral components (cf. Piderit, 2000). A multidimensional view of resistance \nencompasses both employees\u2019 behavioral responses to change as well as their internal (i.e., \ncognitive and affective) reactions, and thus provides for an inclusive assessment of resistance.  \nChange process characteristics: information, participation and trust in management  \nCurrent thinking about change management emphasizes that employee acceptance of \nchange is enhanced by characteristics of the change process (Dent & Goldberg, 1999; Oreg, \n2006). The timely and accurate provision of information, opportunities for participation, and \nthe diffusion of trust in management\u2019s vision underlying the change, have all been noted as \npotential alleviators of employees\u2019 resistance to change (Bordia et al., 2004; Oreg, 2006).  \nA major aim of providing information about the change is to keep employees \nknowledgeable of anticipated events, such as the specific changes that will occur, the \nconsequences of the change, and employees\u2019 new work roles. Providing information can help \nreduce uncertainty and anxiety (Johnson, Bernhagen, Miller, & Allen, 1996; Miller et al., \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          6 \n \n1994), and can ultimately contribute to creating increased openness towards change (Stanley \net al., 2005; Wanberg & Banas, 2000). Alternatively, poorly managed change communication \nmay result in widespread rumors (DiFonzo, Bordia, & Rosnow, 1994), increased cynicism \nand resistance to change (Stanley et al., 2005), and negative outcomes such as absenteeism \nand turnover (Johnson et al., 1996). \nSimilarly, change management procedures that allow employees to participate in the \nplanning and implementation of the change have been found to increase change acceptance \n(Coch & French, 1948; Sagie & Koslowsky, 1996). Participation offers a variety of potential \nbenefits, such as an increased understanding of the circumstances that make change necessary, \na sense of ownership and control over the change process, and increased readiness for change \n(Armenakis et al., 1993). Research on participative leadership has also supported the existence \nof such benefits, and has revealed relationships between participation and acceptance of, and \ncommitment to, decisions (Strauss, 1998). With respect to organizational change, Sagie and \nKoslowsky (1996) observed positive effects of participation in decisions concerning the \nimplementation of a change. Similarly, Wanberg and Banas (2000) found that participation in \nthe change decision-making process was related to a more positive view of the change.  \nTrust in those leading the change is also considered an important aspect of a change \nprocess, and a prerequisite for employees\u2019 cooperation with the change (e.g., Kotter, 1995). \nTrust has been widely recognized as a vital component of effective and satisfactory \nrelationships among employees and a critical element for organizations\u2019 success (Caldwell & \nClapham, 2003; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). Empirical research has \ndemonstrated the effects of trust on a variety of employee behaviors including organizational \ncitizenship behavior and performance (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). With respect to organizational \nchange, it is repeatedly emphasized that employees need to have confidence in management\u2019s \nreliability and integrity, and need to accept management\u2019s vision for change efforts to succeed \n(Li, 2005). If employees have little faith in those who are responsible for the change, they may \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          7 \n \nalienate themselves from the change and react with fear and resistance (Kotter, 1995; Dribben, \n2000). Accordingly, several studies have found significant relationships between employee \ntrust and reactions to an organizational change (e.g., Oreg, 2006; Stanley et al., 2005).  \nThus, characteristics of the change process appear to have a key role in shaping \nemployees\u2019 reactions to change. Employees will be more open to the change when they \nreceive timely and accurate information about the change and its implications, when they have \nopportunities for participation in the implementation of the change, and when they experience \ntrust in those managing the change. \nHypothesis 1: Information, participation, and trust in management are negatively \nassociated with resistance to change. \nDaily work context: Leader-member exchange and perceived development climate \nTaking our conceptualizations one step further, we ask what are some of the \norganizational characteristics from which the change process may evolve? Clearly, \ncharacteristics of the change process do not occur within a vacuum. Rather, they evolve from \nthe daily context within which organizations function. We suggest that this daily context, \nconceptualized as the structural characteristics of the daily work situation, is related both to \nhow change is managed, and to employees' ultimate reactions to change. More specifically, \nwe suggest that characteristics of the daily context, such as leadership and perceived climate, \nare associated with employees\u2019 reactions to the change both directly and indirectly, through \ntheir influence on the change process. \nLeadership research reveals the strong effect that leaders have on followers\u2019 behaviors \nand attitudes (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Gerstner & Day, 1997) and several models of \norganizational change emphasize leadership\u2019s role in implementing and supporting change \n(e.g., Whelan-Berry, Gordon, & Hinings, 2003). In particular, the effect of leadership during \nchange may depend on the exchange relationship the leader has developed with employees. \nAccording to leader-member exchange (LMX) theory, leaders have differentiated \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          8 \n \nrelationships with their employees on a dyadic basis (Graen, 2004; Graen & Uhl Bien, 1995). \nWhereas low-quality relationships involve rudimentary exchanges that fall under the basic \nemployment contract, high-quality relationships are characterized by liking, loyalty, and \nprofessional respect between leader and employee (Dienesch & Liden, 1986). \nAssociations have been established between LMX relationships and important \noutcomes, such as performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover \n(e.g., Bauer, Erdogan, Liden, & Wayne, 2006; Gerstner & Day, 1997). In addition, employees \nin high-quality LMX relationships have been shown to exhibit higher levels of organizational \ncitizenship behavior (Hofmann, Morgeson, & Gerras, 2003). Given that cooperation with \nchanges can be seen as an example of citizenship behavior (Organ, 1988), we expect that \nemployees in high-quality LMX relationships will react more positively towards \norganizational changes compared with employees in low-quality LMX relationships. Indeed, \nalthough not tested in the context of an actual organizational change, high-quality LMX \nrelationships have been shown to correlate with receptivity to change (Tierney, 1999). \nAt the same time, the LMX relationship may also influence resistance indirectly, \nthrough its influence on the change process. Research has shown that leaders engage in \ndifferential behavior depending on the specific relationship with the employee. For instance, \nBezuijen (2005) found that leaders set higher goals and provide more feedback in high-quality \nLMX relationships compared with low-quality LMX relationships. Differential behavior may \nalso occur during organizational change, with leaders providing their high-LMX subordinates \nwith more information and opportunities to participate. Furthermore, Sparrowe and Liden \n(2005) have shown that high-LMX employees are more readily integrated into the leader\u2019s \npersonal network, which in turn increases access to information and allows for participation. \nIn sum, it is likely that, owing to a close work relationship and to network inclusion, \nemployees in high-quality LMX relationships will receive more information about the change, \nwill have a greater opportunity to participate, and will develop greater trust in management, \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          9 \n \ncompared with employees in low-quality LMX relationships. As a result, employees in high-\nquality LMX relationships will develop less resistance to the change than employees in low-\nquality LMX relationships.  \nHypothesis 2: There is a negative relationship between LMX and resistance to \nchange that is mediated by information, participation, and trust in management.  \n A second important factor in one\u2019s work context that could relate to the change \nprocess and to employees\u2019 reactions to change concerns the extent to which the organization\u2019s \nclimate is perceived as developmental. To keep up with an ever-changing environment, \norganizations and work settings need to maintain a climate that promotes organizational and \nindividual development (Fugate, Kinicki, & Ashforth, 2004). Climate perceptions are seen as \ncritical determinants of individual behavior, mediating the relationship between objective \nwork environment characteristics and individuals\u2019 responses (Carr, Schmidt, Ford, & DeShon, \n2003). A climate that fosters continuous development (henceforth, development climate) \nencompasses the different ways in which the organization, its leaders, and its employees \nsupport, encourage, and exercise organizational and individual learning and growth. Job \nrotation, assignments to special projects, training, on-the-job learning, and support for \ndevelopment are some of the experiences that enhance workforce quality and flexibility as \nwell as organization adaptability (McCauley & Hezlett, 2001). In general, environments that \nare development-oriented have been associated with positive outcomes, such as performance, \nlearning, and feedback seeking (DeShon & Gillespie, 2005; Payne, Youngcourt, & Beaubien, \n2007). Additionally, Van Dam and Seijts (2007) observed a positive relationship between \ndevelopment climate and employees\u2019 attitudes towards continuous change. \nBecause in many organizations, change constitutes part of the daily routine that is \nsupported and encouraged, it is likely that employees\u2019 perceptions of a development climate \nwill also be positively associated with their openness to organizational changes. This \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          10 \n \nassumption corresponds with Tierney\u2019s (1999) notion that reactions to a given organizational \nchange would be related with the extent to which the organization's climate is change-\noriented. Employees who perceive a strong development climate may be more inclined to \nconsider organizational change as an opportunity for growth and learning (Fugate et al., \n2004), and will therefore develop less resistance to changes. Furthermore, when continuous \nchange and development are a central part of the daily work situation, employees will be more \ninvolved in the ongoing changes, and communication and participation will take a more \ncentral role in their daily routines. Employees in such work settings are likely to receive \ntimely and accurate information, to have opportunities for participation, and to experience \ntrust in those managing the change, and consequently will be more open to the change. \nHypothesis 3: There is a negative relationship between perceived development \nclimate and resistance to change that is mediated by information, participation, \nand trust in management. \nIndividual characteristics: Openness to job changes, and role breadth self-efficacy \nAlthough individuals\u2019 reactions to change are to some extent change-specific and \ndepend on the particular characteristics of the change at hand, there are also individual \ndifferences in how people typically respond to change (e.g., Oreg, 2003). Some people may be \ninclined to resist organizational changes because they dislike alterations in their current work \nsituation (Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, & Plamondon, 2000), or because they are not confident \nabout their capabilities to perform in a changed situation (Parker, 1998). Accordingly, two \nindividual differences variables were included in our study as potential correlates of reactions \nto change: openness to job changes and role breadth self-efficacy.  \nOpenness to job changes is defined as employees\u2019 preparedness to engage in intra-\norganizational job transitions, such as changing tasks, jobs, departments, or locations (Van \nDam, 2005). Both continuous and large-scale organizational changes often imply that \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          11 \n \nemployees will have to make changes in their present work situations and adapt to the new \nsituation. Therefore, openness to job changes is considered an important aspect of employee \nadaptability (Fugate et al., 2004; Hall, 2002; Pulakos et al., 2000). Individuals with an open \nattitude towards change tend to exhibit flexibility when confronted with the challenges \ninherent in changing situations (Miller et al., 1994). Van Dam (2003) found that openness to \njob changes was a strong predictor of individuals\u2019 willingness to participate in required job \ntransitions. Although openness to job changes is more attitude-like than personality traits \n(e.g., openness to experience) in that it refers to the particular context of work, it nevertheless \nrepresents a general disposition or orientation towards work-related changes that antecedes \nindividuals\u2019 reactions to specific organizational changes. We expect that employees who are \ntypically open to changes in their personal work situation will be more open to a given \norganizational change compared with those not open to job changes. \nHypothesis 4: Openness to job changes is negatively related to resistance to \nchange.  \nRole breadth self-efficacy refers to \u2015employees\u2019 perceived capability of carrying out a \nbroader and more proactive set of work tasks that extend beyond prescribed technical \nrequirements\u2016 (Parker, 1998, p. 835). This reliance on broad capabilities and self-direction is \nespecially important during organizational change, when employees may have to perform new \nwork roles. Because individuals differ in their ability to adapt to new roles, it is possible that \nemployees\u2019 judgment of their capability to deal with these changes will affect their reactions \nto the change. Research has demonstrated that employees will resist changes they believe to \nexceed their working capabilities (Armenakis et al., 1993). In contrast, employees who feel \ncapable of performing particular tasks have been found to cope more effectively with change \n(Cunningham et al., 2002; Hill, Smith, & Mann, 1987). More generally, there is extensive \nevidence that self-efficacy is related to work-related performance, coping with difficult tasks, \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          12 \n \ncareer choice, learning capabilities, and individuals\u2019 achievements (Gist & Mitchell, 1992). \nThus, role breadth self-efficacy presents itself as a likely correlate of employees\u2019 emotions \nand reactions to organizational change. Employees with high role breadth self-efficacy are \nexpected to resist organizational change less than those with low role breadth self-efficacy.  \nHypothesis 5: Role breadth self-efficacy is negatively related to resistance to \nchange. \nMethod \nContext, Procedure, and Sample \nParticipants were employees of a large housing corporation in the Netherlands. At the \ntime of the study, employees were experiencing several organizational changes as a result of a \nmerger between two housing corporations. The objective of the merger was to increase the \norganization\u2019s market share and to enhance operational and financial efficiency. Owing to the \nmerger, employees were faced with drastically altered working procedures and management \npractices, with a different culture, and with an overall sense of uncertainty. It should be noted \nthat a few months after the data were collected, management concluded that the merger was \nunsuccessful, and decided to reorganize the organization yet again.  \nFive hundred questionnaires were distributed throughout the organization. A cover \nletter explaining the purpose and scope of the study assured respondents of strict anonymity \nand emphasized that participation was voluntary. Of the questionnaires distributed, we \nreceived 235 usable responses, implying a response rate of 47%. Respondents had a mean age \nof 39.9 years (SD = 9.7), and 54 percent were male. Mean tenure with the organization was \n10.9 years (SD = 9.1), and education levels included high school (29.8%), bachelor (61.7%) \nand master (8.5%) degrees. Respondents worked at various organizational units, such as \ntechnical, secretarial, and customer service; 16.2 percent held a supervisory position.  \nMeasures \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          13 \n \nUnless otherwise indicated, a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly \ndisagree) to 5 (strongly agree) was used for all scales, such that higher scores reflected higher \nvalues on the variable. Cronbach\u2019s alpha (\u03b1) was calculated as an estimate of the internal \nconsistency reliability for each scale. \nLeader-member exchange. Employees were asked to rate the LMX relationship with \ntheir supervisor through the LMX7 scale (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995; Scandura & Graen, 1984) \nas recommended by Gerstner and Day (1997). An example item is \u2015My working relationship \nwith my leader is good\u2016. The scale\u2019s Cronbach\u2019s alpha in the present study was .92.  \nPerceived development climate. Perceived development climate was assessed with \nBezuijen\u2019s (2005) 11-item scale that probed into the various development practices and \nfacilities within the organization, such as peer and supervisor support for development and \nopportunities for personal development (see Appendix). The scale\u2019s Cronbach\u2019s alpha was \n.87. \nChange process characteristics. Oreg\u2019s (2006) measures for change process \ncharacteristics were used to assess information (4 items, including \u2015I have received adequate \ninformation about the forthcoming change\u2016; \u03b1 = .91), participation (4 items, including \u2015I had \nthe opportunity to influence the decisions made regarding the change\u2016; \u03b1 = .91), and trust in \nmanagement (3 items, including \u2015I believed that if management is proposing such a change, \nthere must be a good reason for it\u2016; \u03b1 = .77). Most of these items were used in previous \nstudies (Miller et al., 1994; Wanberg & Banas, 2000) and the scales have been shown to \ncomprise reliable and valid measures of the underlying constructs.  \nOpenness to job changes. Employees\u2019 openness to job changes was assessed with a \nscale developed by Van Dam\u2019s (2005) measuring employees\u2019 attitudes towards changing \ntasks and departments. An example item was \u2015I would like to have a change in work activities \nsoon\u2016. Cronbach\u2019s alpha of was .84. \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          14 \n \nRole breadth self-efficacy. Parker\u2019s (1998) Role breadth self-efficacy scale was used. \nRespondents had to indicate on a five-point scale (1 = poorly; 5 = very well), how well they \nthought they were able to achieve a number of tasks, such as \u2015Providing management with \nsuggestions for work improvement\u2016. Cronbach\u2019s alpha of this 10-item scale was .85. \nResistance to change. Employees\u2019 resistance to the change was measured with an 18-\nitem scale developed by Oreg\u2019s (2006) that included cognitive, affective, and behavioral \nreactions to a change (cf. Piderit, 2000). Sample items include \u2015I was afraid of the change\u2016, \u2015I \nbelieved that the change would make my job harder\u2016, and \u2015I protested against the change\u2016. \nCronbach\u2019s alpha of this scale was .92. \nControl variables. Age, gender, educational level, and tenure were included as control \nvariables. \nConfirmatory Factor Analysis. To investigate whether the scales were measuring \ndistinct constructs, the items that comprised the measures were submitted to a confirmatory \nfactor analysis. An examination of the fit indices indicated that the measurement model had \nacceptable fit (\n2\n\/df = 1.89; CFI = .90, RMSEA = .062). The results also showed that one item \nof the openness-to-job-changes scale and three items of the resistance-to-change scale had \nconsistently higher standardized residuals (2.5 \u2013 3.6). In order to preserve measurement \nproperties and enhance comparibility of research findings, it was decided to use the original \nscales and not remove these items. It should be noted, however, that separate analyses, in \nwhich these items were dropped, yielded findings that were equivalent to those achieved with \nthe original scales. \nAnalyses \nStructural equations modeling (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation was used \nto test the hypotheses and the fit of the overarching model. Although the data could also be \nanalyzed using standard regression procedures, a structural equations analysis has the \nadditional advantage of testing all relationships simultaneously and providing a statistical test \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          15 \n \nof the overall fit of our model. Multiple fit indices were used to assess the adequacy of the \nestimated model: the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the comparative-fit-index (CFI), and the root \nmean squared error of approximation (RMSEA). It is generally suggested that the TLI and \nCFI should exceed .90 or even .95 for the model to be considered of good fit (Hu & Bentler, \n1999); similarly, a value of .06 or less for the RMSEA reflects good fit (Browne & Cudeck, \n1993). Finally, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was calculated, for choosing among \ncompeting models. Since AIC aims at choosing a parsimonious model, one should opt for the \nmodel with the smallest AIC value. These analyses were performed with the AMOS 6.0 \nsoftware package (Arbuckle, 2006).  \nResults \nPreliminary analyses \nPreliminary analyses showed that one of the control variables, organizational tenure, \nwas significantly related to resistance to change. Therefore, tenure was included in the \nanalyses. Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, reliabilities, and intercorrelations of \nthe study variables. \n----- Insert Table 1 about here ----- \nModel fit and hypotheses tests \nThe hypothesized model, including tenure as a control, showed a good fit: \u03c72 (df = 11, \nN = 235) =18.58, p = .07; \u03c72  \/ df = 1.69; CFI = .98; TLI = .95; RMSEA = .05 [RI = .00 - .09]; \nAIC = 86.58. The standardized regression coefficients are presented in Table 2. LMX was \nsignificantly related to the three change process characteristics, information (  =.24, p < .001), \nparticipation (  = .19, p < .01) and trust in management (  = .33, p < .001). Similarly, \ndevelopment climate showed significant relationships with information (  =.24, p < .001), \nparticipation (  = .36, p < .001) and trust in management (  = .28, p < .001). In turn, these \nprocess characteristics showed significant relationships with resistance to change (  = -.23, p \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          16 \n \n< .001, for information;  = -.31, p < .001, for participation;  = -.19, p < .001, for trust in \nmanagement). As such, the findings supported Hypotheses 1-3. \nHypothesis 4 was also supported: openness to job changes was significantly and \nnegatively associated with resistance to change (  = -.16, p < .01). Only role breadth self-\nefficacy was not significantly related to resistance to change (  = -.05, ns). Therefore, \nHypothesis 5 was not confirmed. Together, the model variables explained 39.4 percent of the \nvariance in resistance to change.  \n----- Insert Table 2 about here ----- \n To further examine the validity of our research model, we compared it with two \nalternative models. The first alternative model (Model B) extended the research model by \nallowing for direct relationships between the context variables and resistance to change, in \naddition to the indirect relationships specified by our research model. The second alternative \nmodel (Model C) specified only direct relationships of the predictors (context variables and \nprocess characteristics) with resistance to change, excluding possible mediating effects of the \nprocess characteristics. \nAlthough a good fit was found for Model B [\u03c72 (df = 9, N = 235) = 15.36, p = .05; \u03c72  \/ \ndf = 1.71; CFI = .99; TLI = .96; RMSEA = .05 [RI = .00 - .08]; AIC = 91.36], the direct \nrelationships that were added were not significant (  = -.09, ns, for LMX;  = -.12, ns, for \nperceived development climate). Moreover, Model B was less economic than the research \nmodel, with a higher AIC value (91.36) than the AIC of the research model (80.92). These \nfindings therefore support the superiority of our research model over Model B. In addition, Fit \nindices for Model C did not reach acceptable values [\u03c72  (df = 12, N = 235) = 65.51, p < .001; \n\u03c72  \/ df = 5.29; CFI = .89; TLI = .67; RMSEA = .12 [RI = .10 - .17]; AIC = 129.505].  \nTogether, the outcomes of these additional analyses suggest that the research model \nwith indirect relationships is to be preferred over alternative models with direct relationships. \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          17 \n \nThe results indicate that LMX and perceived development climate are related to resistance to \nchange and that this relationship is fully mediated by change process quality, as indicated by \ninformation, participation, and trust. \nDiscussion \nThe purpose of this study was to examine how characteristics of the daily work \ncontext relate to employees\u2019 resistance to an organizational change through their effect on the \nchange process. The results strongly supported our expectations, showing that the three \nchange process characteristics fully mediated the relationships of LMX and perceived \ndevelopment climate with resistance to change. Employees who perceived a high-quality \nLMX relationship and a strong development climate had received more information and \nopportunities for participation, experienced more trust in management, and subsequently   \nreported less resistance to the change. These findings are consistent with the general notion \nthat characteristics of the work environment must support and reinforce a climate that is \nconducive to the change in order for a change effort to be effective and enduring (e.g., \nArmenakis et al., 1993). Our findings indicate that organizational changes may evolve more \nsmoothly in work environments that are characterized by high-quality LMX relationships and \nwhen employees perceive the development climate to be strong. As such, this study supports \nTierney\u2019s (1999) proposition that both LMX and a change-oriented climate are related to \nemployees\u2019 reactions to specific organizational changes. \nOur findings also confirm the relevance of the change process for employees\u2019 \nreactions to the change. As has been demonstrated in previous studies (Miller et al., 1994; \nOreg, 2006; Wanberg & Banas, 2000), we found significant relationships between resistance \nto change and the three change process characteristics: the provision of information, \nopportunities for participation, and trust in those managing the change.  \nIndividual-level characteristics were also found to relate to employees\u2019 resistance to \nthe change. The more open employees were to job changes in general, the more likely they \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          18 \n \nwere to perceive the organizational change in favorable terms. Whereas the merger may have \nbeen perceived as a challenge for those who were high in their openness to job changes, it \ncould very well have been perceived as a threat by those low on openness. Previous studies \nhave similarly observed relationships between individual characteristics and reactions to \nchange (Judge et al., 1999; Miller et al., 1994; Wanberg & Banas, 2000). Wanberg and Banas \n(2000) noticed that employees with a resilient personality, characterized by high levels of self-\nesteem, optimism, and perceived control, were more open towards organizational change than \nemployees who were less resilient. Judge et al. (1999) observed relationship between \nmanagers\u2019 positive self-concept and risk tolerance and their coping with organizational \nchange. Similarly, Oreg (2003, 2006) demonstrated the impact of a dispositional inclination to \nresist change on people\u2019s responses to specific organizational changes. Because dispositional \ncharacteristics such as resilience or the self-concept are considered relatively stable \npersonality traits, it would be unreasonable to presume to change them within the \norganizational context. Contrarily, openness to job changes is not entirely dispositional in \nnature, and has been shown to be more malleable, through managerial interventions such as \njob rotation (Campion, Cheraskin, & Stevens, 1994) and career support (Van Dam, 2004).  \nBeyond the hypothesized relationships, we found a positive relationship between \norganizational tenure and resistance to change. There are several possible reasons why \norganizational tenure would relate to resistance to change. First, research on employee \nretention has shown that employees stay with the organization when they are satisfied or when \nthey perceive few job alternatives (e.g., Griffeth, Hom, & Gaertner, 2000). Since \norganizational change is usually associated with changes in the individual\u2019s work situation, \nemployees who are more satisfied with their current work situation, and those who perceive \nless job alternatives, will be less positive towards changing their situation and may therefore \nexhibit greater resistance to the organizational change. Second, during their time in the \norganization, employees\u2019 investments in the work situation, such as retirement programs, \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          19 \n \nacquisition of specific skills, and home ownership, increase (Rusbult & Farrell, 1983). \nBecause organizational change may endanger these investments, high-tenured employees may \nresist the change more than low-tenured employees. Indeed, this rationale falls in line with \nresearch that has demonstrated a positive relationship between job experience and reluctance \nto adopt new work procedures (Sagie, Elizur, & Greenbaum, 1985). In any case, our findings \nsuggest that organizations should pay particular attention to their higher-tenured employees, \nbecause they are likely to oppose the change more than their low-tenured colleagues. \nSurprisingly, employees\u2019 role breadth self-efficacy was not related to resistance to \nchange. This finding is in contrast with other studies that have observed employees\u2019 self-\nefficacy to be linked to reactions to a change (e.g., Cunningham et al., 2002). In these studies, \nhowever, different measures of self-efficacy were applied, such as job-change self-efficacy \n(Cunningham et al., 2002). It is possible that Parker\u2019s (1998) role breadth self-efficacy scale \nthat was used in the present study captured a different aspect of employees\u2019 self-efficacy, \nwhich is less closely tied to people\u2019s change reactions. Furthermore, the change situations \nmeasured in the present study were different than those previously considered. Although the \nmerger in our study implied pervasive changes, such as different working procedures and \nchanged management practices, most employees in our sample were not required to change \npositions as a result of the merger and therefore were not likely to have had to carry out a \nbroader set of work tasks. Future research may look further into the conditions under which \nself-efficacy is related to resistance to change. \nAlthough we believe our findings offer a number of meaningful theoretical and \npractical implications, a few limitations deserve mention. First, the study took place in only \none organization in the service sector, which somewhat questions the extent to which we can \ngeneralize these findings to other organizations or other sectors. Nevertheless, the fact that our \nhypotheses are strongly indicated by previous theoretical formulations and by previous \nfindings, from a variety of organizational contexts, provides some support for the robustness \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          20 \n \nof our findings (Johnson et al., 1996; Judge et al., 1999; Miller et al., 1994; Stanley et al., \n2005; Wanberg & Banas, 2000). \nSecond, there was only one administration of the survey, which limits the degree to \nwhich we can make causal inferences. While the findings are in line with our theoretical \nmodel, we can not rule out the possibility that other directionalities of relationships exist \namong our variables. For example, it is possible that beyond the influence of the change \nprocess on resistance to change, employees' reactions to the change had influenced their \nperceptions of the change process characteristics. While a pre-change assessment of LMX and \nperceived development climate was not possible in the present study due to the onset of the \nchange at the time of data collection, the use of a longitudinal design in future works is \ncertainly warranted as a means of testing such alternative explanations. \nThird, variables were measured with a common method and source, which could be \nresponsible, at least in part, for the observed relationships. Given the subject matter of this \nstudy, it would be rather difficult to obtain measures from different sources. Furthermore, the \npattern of intercorrelations among our variables suggests that the findings are not solely a \nfunction of common method variance. If common method variance was the sole source of our \nfindings, the confirmatory factor analysis would not have corroborated the existence of \ndiscernable measures. Furthermore, some research has shown that common method variance \ngenerally is not robust enough to invalidate research findings from studies with a single \nsource and method (Doty & Glick, 1998), and that the extent to which findings are discounted \ndue to mono-method variance is greatly exaggerated (Spector, 2006). \nOur findings have several practical implications. Reviews of change management \neffectiveness have shown that more than half of all change interventions fail (e.g., Porras & \nRobertson, 1992). Therefore, there is considerable room for improving the effectiveness of \nchange efforts (Judge et al., 1999). The findings of this study suggest that one way of making \nchange efforts more successful lies in how the change is managed. Whereas organizations \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          21 \n \nmay be inclined to become more top-down, and increase the distance between management \nand the work force when changes are forthcoming, our results indicate that an opposite \nstrategy may be more profitable. Resistances can be tempered by involving employees in the \nchange process through the provision of timely and accurate information, and opportunities \nfor participation in the planning and implementation of the change (Johnson et al., 1996). \nDisregarding such practices may decrease employees\u2019 faith and trust in the change \nmanagement (Bordia et al., 2004; Stanley et al., 2005), and may ultimately fuel employees\u2019 \nresistance. Therefore, change agents and other organizational authorities are likely to benefit \nfrom paying closer attention to change process issues. Extensive communication and \nparticipation should be made available to all employees, including those who work under pure \neconomic exchange relationships. Furthermore, beyond the long-term benefits involved, \nfostering trust is key to harnessing employees\u2019 cooperation and support in times of change. \nBut even before an actual change intervention becomes necessary, organizations can \nmaintain the basic conditions required for effective change implementation by addressing the \ndaily work context. Over time, organizational relationships and practices evolve that affect the \nframework within which forthcoming changes take place. These day-to-day expectations and \ninteractions can affect how the change process develops and how the change is implemented, \nperceived and evaluated. In turn this may indirectly influence the overall effectiveness of the \nchange. Our findings indicate that organizational changes stand a better chance in work \nsituations that are characterized by close and supportive relationships between leaders and \nsubordinates, and a climate that fosters continuous change and development. \nThere may very well be other aspects of the daily work situation that could also relate \nto the change process and, eventually, to employees\u2019 reactions to change. For instance, work \naspects that are related to creativity and innovative behavior (Amabile & Conti, 1999), and \naspects related to justice perceptions (Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, & Ng, 2001) may \nalso be relevant for change situations. Future research should expand the context \nLMX, Development Climate, and Resistance to Change          22 \n \ncharacteristics studied here and consider additional contextual variables that could further \nexplain employees\u2019 reactions to organizational change. \nReferences \nAmabile, T.M., & Conti, R.
