The High level group made\nrecommendations to the CMO to address possible ways for-\nward to improve clinical effectiveness in the UK National\nHealth Service (NHS) and promote clinical engagement to\ndeliver this. The report contained a short section on research\nneeds that emerged from the process of writing the report,\nbut in order to more fully identify the relevant research\nagenda Professor Sir John Tooke asked Professor Martin\nEccles to convene an expert group \u2013 the Clinical Effectiveness\nResearch Agenda Group (CERAG) \u2013 to define the research\nagenda. The CERAG's terms of reference were 'to further elab-\norate the research agenda in relation to pursuing clinically\neffective practice within the (UK) National Health Service'.\nTerminology is a problem in both the practice of, and\nresearching into, clinical effectiveness. The high level group\nuses the term 'clinical effectiveness' as it built on the termi-\nnology used within the CMO's report. However, a study of\n33 applied research funding agencies across nine countries\nidentified 29 terms used to refer to some aspect of the proc-\nesses around clinically effective practice [1]. This confusion\nhas been compounded by the recent prominence of 'Trans-\nlational Research', and the description of the first and sec-\nond translation gaps. Given the balance of scientific\nendeavour and funding, the term 'Translational Research' is\nmainly thought of as the T1 bench to bedside process of\ntransferring basic science knowledge into new drugs and\ntechnologies. Attracting about 1% of the research funding\ndevoted to T1 research the T2 Translational Research is the\nprocess of taking current scientific knowledge and ensuring\nit is applied in routine clinical care [2].\nWithin the UK, the terms 'Implementation' and 'Imple-\nmentation Research' seem to be the best recognised.\nTherefore, as a focus for its deliberations the CERAG\nadopted the following definition:\n'Implementation Research is the scientific study of\nmethods to promote the systematic uptake of clinical\nresearch findings and other evidence-based practices\ninto routine practice, and hence to improve the quality\n(effectiveness, reliability, safety, appropriateness,\nequity, efficiency) of health care. It includes the study\nof influences on healthcare professional and organisa-\ntional behaviour.' (adapted from Implementation Sci-\nence http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/info\/\nabout\/ accessed 10 February 2009).\nThis editorial presents the summary of the group's report\nand recommendations; the full report is available as Addi-\ntional File 1.\nThe importance of Implementation Research \nand its funding\nThe findings from clinical and health services research can\nnot change population health outcomes unless health\ncare systems, organizations, and professionals adopt them\nin practice [3]. A consistent finding is that the transfer of\nresearch findings into practice is unpredictable and can be\na slow and haphazard process. The relative inattention to\nimplementing what we know is costing lives. There is an\nimbalance between investment in the development of\nnew drugs and technologies versus improving the fidelity\nwith which care is delivered.\nIn a structured review of healthcare professionals views on\nclinician engagement in quality improvement, Davies et\nal. identified 86 empirical reports relevant to the review\n[4]. They report that the literature suggests: healthcare\nprofessionals are heterogeneous in relation to their defini-\ntion of quality; their perception of the need for quality\nimprovement; their attitudes to quality improvement ini-\ntiatives; their attitudes to clinical guidelines and evidence-\nbased practice. In addition, they have a limited under-\nstanding of the concepts and methods of quality improve-\nment, and quality improvement is often the scene of turf\nbattles. Under the heading of perceived barriers, they also\nstated that 'many of the identified barriers arise from the\nwell-documented problems of working effectively\nbetween and across health professions. This means that\nalthough more time and more resources may be necessary\nor helpful (directly and in their explicit recognition of\nhealthcare professionals' concerns), they are unlikely to\nbe sufficient on their own to overcome the substantial\nbarriers to clinicians' active engagement in successful\nquality improvement'. Healthcare professionals are an\nimportant part of the organisation in which they work\n(and are subject to organisational policies, procedures,\nand cultures); this review offers a partial explanation for\nthe persistent quality gaps and also supports the conten-\ntion that it is unlikely that this will change spontaneously.\nRecognition of quality gaps has led to increased interest in\nmore active implementation strategies. Over the past 10\nyears, a body of Implementation Research has developed\n[5-7]. This demonstrates that interventions can be effec-\ntive, but provides less information to guide the choice or\noptimise the components of such complex interventions\nin practice [8]. While the effectiveness of interventions\nvaries across different clinical problems, contexts, and\norganizations, studies provide scant theoretical or concep-\ntual rationale for their choice of intervention [9], and only\nlimited descriptions of the interventions and contextual\ndata [6]. Research on economic and political approaches\nto change is scarce [10], and it is therefore not surprising\nthat little is known about how best to integrate disease\nand case management interventions into existing health-\ncare at the system level. Thus, the science of Implementa-Page 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:18 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/18tion Research is still a work in progress, largely due to the\nfact that it is a relatively young science.\nInternationally, Implementation Research is a recognised\narea of funding within other healthcare systems; this is\nnot the case in the UK. The Cooksey Report [11] suggested\na UK annual research budget (Public sector and major\ncharities) of just over \u00a32 billion. The proportion spent on\nhealth services (as opposed to biomedical or clinical)\nresearch in general is small. While there have been a\nnumber of previous funding programmes for Implemen-\ntation Research within the UK, none are current. The pro-\nportion of annual research money devoted to\nImplementation Research is impossible to quantify; it is\nlikely to be of the order of a maximum of a few millions\npounds per year.\nThe Cooksey Report [11], having identified the need for\nimplementation and Implementation Research, offers a\nsound basis on which to elaborate the Implementation\nResearch agenda as a core part of a research agenda of key\nrelevance to the NHS.\nOne of the major problems with not having a clearly iden-\ntified, named Implementation Research funding stream is\nthat the whole area loses 'profile'; the issues become\nblurred and the central focus of the routine uptake of find-\nings, from clinical research programmes into routine care,\nbecomes lost to research enquiry. In countries where there\nis a named, dedicated, funding stream (e.g., Canada, Aus-\ntralia) the research area has a higher profile with both\nresearchers and with clinicians. There is the potential for\nsenior researchers to establish programmes of research\n(rather than doing one-off studies), junior researchers to\nmake it a career choice, and clinicians to become willing\ncollaborators, thereby facilitating the spread of knowledge\nand the improvement of methods.\nSpecific considerations for an Implementation \nResearch agenda\nIn elaborating the Implementation Research agenda the,\nCERAG identified five important overarching considera-\ntions that should influence thinking about, and commis-\nsioning of, Implementation Research.\nFirst, it is important to consider the multiple levels at\nwhich healthcare is delivered and the interplay between\nthem in their cultural context [12].\nSecond, Implementation Research centrally involves the\nstudy of changing behaviour and maintaining change \u2013 in\norganizations, and the groups and individual healthcare\nprofessionals within them.\nThird, the use of theory in Implementation Research\noffers (at least) three important potential advantages. The-\nories offer a generalisable framework that can apply across\ndiffering settings and individuals; they offer the opportu-\nnity for the incremental accumulation of knowledge; and\nthey offer an explicit framework for analysis. The CERAG\nagreed that appropriate consideration of theory was an\nimportant element of Implementation Research. As well\nas a more thoughtful use of theory, there is a need to work\nthrough the various stages of using theory and resolving\nsuch apparently simple issues as what it means for an\nintervention to be theory-based or what is the theoretical\nbasis of behaviour change.\nFourth, frameworks are potentially useful tools for consid-\nering the issues that a research agenda needs to address\n[13]. Inevitably there is no one ideal, universally accepted\nframework that will fit all purposes; different frameworks\nwill often reflect different purposes, disciplinary, or phil-\nosophical standpoints, and so will appeal to different\ngroups or individuals.\nFifth, a general complaint of implementation studies\n(often trials) is that the need for experimental control,\nmaximising internal validity, compromises external valid-\nity. As ever, the balance of considering these two dimen-\nsions of validity depends on the question that is being\nanswered at the time [14].\nWho is this research agenda aimed at?\nThis discussion of the research agenda is aimed primarily\nat commissioners of research, but will also be of relevance\nto a broader range of policy makers and researchers. While\nthis report has been discussed and written in the context\nof the UK National Health Service and the National Insti-\ntute for Health Research (NIHR) it is possible that a vari-\nety of other research-commissioning organisations could\nuse it to identify areas that are a priority for them. How-\never, it has been considered in its entirety and, in terms of\nprogrammatic commissioning, a piecemeal approach to\naddressing it could leave important areas unaddressed.\nA Research Agenda\nResearch areas\nMany of these research areas are interlinked. The CERAG\noffered exemplar questions within each of them in order\nto illustrate key issues. The processes suggested in the sub-\nsequent recommendations will further elaborate and pri-\noritise the content of this agenda.\nContext\nThe impact of context on implementation is important,\nand systematic study of the attributes of context (and their\nrole and modifiability) that form barriers or facilitators to\nimplementation is needed. The responsiveness of context\nis important in order to understand (and influence) cul-\nture and other attributes of organisations as well as the\nindividuals within them and their interests related toPage 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:18 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/18implementation of new knowledge. The role of context in\nintervention development needs to be better understood.\nBehavioural determinants and evaluation of change \nstrategies\nSuccessful implementation of new knowledge should be\nbuilt on an understanding of the determinants of behav-\nioural change and maintenance of behavioural change in\nindividuals and organisations. Such understanding would\nallow the rational development and testing of implementa-\ntion interventions. This should include the systematic devel-\nopment of interventions and trials across a range of\nconditions and NHS settings. These could include the study\nof the organisational embedding of new interventions, the\neffectiveness of healthcare system interventions, as well as\nevaluation of delivering new models and methods of care.\nThere is a need for studies examining the methods of opti-\nmising the content and methods of delivery of interventions.\nEvaluations should use a range of (and often a combination\nof) research designs and methods (e.g., cluster randomized\ntrials, quasi-experimental designs, and qualitative studies).\nTesting of theory in Implementation Research\nTheory is underused in Implementation Research. There\nneeds to be considerable work on understanding available\ntheories, on the testing and development of theories, and\non how to operationalise theory. This work should not be\nrestricted by disciplinary perspectives, worldview, or area\nof application.\nKnowledge attributes and knowledge generation \u2013 \nfeatures related to uptake\nResearch is needed on the important attributes of new\nknowledge and how these influence its uptake (or not).\nThis would include the attributes of and applicability of\nwhat is regarded as evidence by different individuals and\nin different contexts.\nDecision makers have problems accessing, appraising,\nadapting, and applying research evidence. The increasing\nrecognition that implementation of evidence from indi-\nvidual studies may be misleading, either due to bias in\ntheir conduct or random variations in findings, has led to\ngreater emphasis on knowledge syntheses as the basic unit\nof implementation. Knowledge syntheses interpret the\nresults of individual studies within the context of global\nevidence thus increasing the 'signal to noise ratio' of\nimplementation activities and increasing the likelihood of\ntheir success. Knowledge syntheses provide the evidence\nbase for other implementation vehicles such as patient\ndecision aids, clinical practice guidelines, or policy briefs.\nSystematic review activities (guided by relevant theory)\nneed to be supported systematically to ensure their con-\ntinued development. Important areas activity include:\ncompiling and maintaining a register of systematic\nreviews of Implementation Research; updating overviews\nof reviews of professional behaviour change interven-\ntions; conducting systematic reviews of methods to\nimprove the implementation of clinical research findings\nin routine settings; workshops on conduct and use of\nknowledge syntheses targeted to different stakeholders.\nCross-cutting issues\nMethodology\nAcross all of the areas above there will be important meth-\nodological issues that need to be identified, investigated,\nand resolved. These include:\n1. The area of Implementation Research needs a common\nunderstanding of terms. Important areas of research\ninclude: the development of one or more taxonomies of\nbarriers to implementation, mediating mechanisms and\npathways; standardised measurement approaches for key\nelements of the taxonomy; a suite of reporting guidelines\nfor different types of Implementation Research.\n2. All of the areas pose measurement challenges, such as\nthe development of process and outcome methods and\nmeasures for relevant constructs.\n3. Is there a 'core set' of measures that will be applicable\nto most settings, or is each combination of patient team\nand organisation conceptually unique? The idea of a core\nset of measures offers greater potential for accumulation\nof knowledge.\n4. What are the pros and cons of using proxies for behav-\niour, such as written or web-based vignettes that simulate\nclinical behaviours?\n5. The incorporation of economic analysis within Imple-\nmentation Research is not necessarily methodologically\nchallenging, but it is very uncommon and should be\nencouraged and supported.\n6. An explicit examination of the pros and cons of the use of\nroutinely available data to assess implementation. This\nwould include the availability of data and the specificity of\ndata in relation to the implementation of research evidence.\nAre there situations where there is sufficient routinely availa-\nble data for economic modelling to demonstrate the viability\nor otherwise of certain behaviour change strategies? How\ncomplex can and should such modelling become?\nImplementation Research across different areas of clinical practice\nImplementation Research will be conducted in a range of clin-\nical areas. This needs to be done in a way that ensures contri-\nbution to an incremental understanding of implementation.\nResearch in one clinical area should generate ideas and under-\nstanding that can be drawn on in other clinical areas.Page 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:18 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/18Page 5 of 7\nKnowledge infrastructure for Implementation\nThis links to 'knowledge attributes', (above) and is\naddressed in the UK by initiatives such as the NHS\nNational Library for Health, the Cochrane Collaboration\nand Social Care Online. Nonetheless, the process recom-\nmended below could formally set out the knowledge\ninfrastructure for implementation. This would be an\nimportant exercise in making explicit the content of an\ninfrastructure (staff, skills, and resources), its scale, and its\ndegree of current (and future) integration into routine\nhealthcare.\nSustainability\nThe consideration of sustainability permeates the research\nagenda. It is important to have a healthcare workforce that\ncan sustain implementation in the clinical setting as a\nmatter of routine. It is important that we learn more about\nthe organisational\/contextual factors that enable the sus-\ntained use of evidence in practice. It is also important to\nhave a research workforce that can sustain the area of\nImplementation Research.\nWithin research itself it is important to examine attributes\nof sustainability (within individuals, teams, and organiza-\ntions) and to develop methods to examine whether the\neffects of interventions are sustained over time.\nCommunication strategy\/engagement with the NHS\nAs part of integrating implementation and Implementa-\ntion Research within the NHS it will be vital to develop an\nexplicit communication and engagement strategy.\nWorkforce issues\nCapacity to do implementation\nHow should the NHS workforce (clinicians\/practitioners\nand managers) be trained (at both undergraduate and\npostgraduate levels) in order to optimise their ability to\nimplement new knowledge (without doing harm, over-\nspending, giving more to one patient than another, while\nalso stopping ineffective practices)?\nWhat are effective engagement strategies to involve the\nworkforce in implementation?\nWhat are the important attributes of the workforce that\nenhance knowledge use and implementation in health-\ncare settings?\nHow can these attributes be sustained both within indi-\nviduals and organisations?\nCapacity to do Implementation Research\nCapacity to do research into implementation is limited\nboth within the UK and internationally. The NIHR needs\na strategy of building capacity at all levels of the researcher\ncareer. Given the time that it takes to build experience in\nthis area NIHR needs a cadre of experienced senior inves-\ntigators who can direct programmes of research.\nA funding strategy should also train junior researchers to\nbe capable of developing into independent researchers\n(this should be linked with experience Implementation\nResearchers). This could involve a mix of PhD student-\nships and fellowship awards.\nAttributes of research teams addressing this agenda\nAddressing this research agenda will be an inherently\nmulti- and inter-disciplinary endeavor. No one practice or\nacademic group or discipline will bring all the necessary\nattributes to address the research agenda. The range of\nrequired disciplines will vary within and across the vari-\nous areas of the research agenda, but is likely to include\nsome of Implementation Research, sociology, health psy-\nchology, health economics, and statistics.\nImplementation and evidence of benefit from clinical and \npublic health interventions\nIt will most often be the case that the Implementation\nResearch agenda will be applied to areas where there is a\nclear understanding of appropriate clinical care or public\nhealth practice. In some areas there will be insufficient\npublished evidence to inform a clear, shared understand-\ning of optimum practice; in such instances the research\nagenda should address the need for evidence of efficient\nclinical and public health practice.\nRecommendations\n1. NIHR should initiate a process to establish a research\nprogramme within NIHR with an explicit dedicated, pro-\ntected, funding stream for funding Implementation\nResearch.\na. This process should detail issues such as:\ni. the scope and prioritization of topics for such a\nprogramme.\nii. the potential overlap with current national\nresearch programmes within and outwith NIHR.\niii. the potential overlap with other NIHR funded\ninitiatives \u2013 National Library for Health, Collabo-\nrations for Leadership in Applied Health Research\nand Care (CLAHRCs), Cochrane Collaboration.\niv. the relevant stakeholders in the process.\nv. the appropriate configuration of such a pro-\ngramme of research \u2013 either as a single entity (max-\nimising focus, scarce researcher resources, and\ncritical mass), or as a dimension of each of the cur-\nrent national programmes (more diffuse, but(page number not for citation purposes)\nImplementation Science 2009, 4:18 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/4\/1\/18probably more administratively straightforward to\nestablish).\nvi. the establishment of a commissioning group\nwith appropriate expertise to evaluate proposals.\nvii. the timescale for establishing launching and\ncommissioning research within such a pro-\ngramme.\nviii. relevant indicators of success for such a pro-\ngramme to allow its evaluation.\nb. Given the scale for return on investment and poten-\ntial to save lives, this should aim to achieve a steady-\nstate annual budget of 2 to 3% of NIHR total research\nbudget. With total budget estimates at \u00a3750 million,\nthis equates to approximately \u00a315 to 22 million.\nc. Spending on this scale will not be achievable imme-\ndiately, and so the process should consider an escalat-\ning funding process starting at a lower level and\nincrementally rising to the steady-state figure over a\nnumber of years.\nd. Long-term commitment is needed to deal with the\nissue of creating a climate conducive to conducting\nImplementation Research and the closely linked area\nof using research findings in routine settings. Without\nthis being seen as both central and important, it is\nunlikely to be sustained.\ne. Consideration should be given to the idea of estab-\nlishing one or more Centers of Implementation\nResearch Excellence along the lines of the Public\nHealth Centers of Excellence.\n2. A mix of project and programme funding would allow\nstudies of a shorter and more 'worked through' nature, as\nwell as series of interlinked conceptual, methodological\nwork that is needed in the area.\n3. The process of commissioning should be a mix of com-\nmissioner-defined and curiosity-driven. In such a rela-\ntively young area, it is unlikely to be possible for a\ncommissioned research process to fully cover all relevant\nareas, particularly in the areas of methodological and con-\nceptual work.\n4. In order to enhance capacity development, a propor-\ntion of the funding should be directed towards student-\nships, fellowships, and bursaries.\n5. There should be consideration of the development of\ntraining programmes for Implementation Researchers.\nAlthough not a research budget cost, there should also be\nconsideration of the development of (pre- and post-regis-\ntration) training programmes for clinicians and non-clini-\ncians within the NHS around building capacity to better\nuse implementation (and clinical) research in daily prac-\ntice.\n6. Implementation Research and Implementation\nResearchers need to be embedded within the NHS. One\nway to achieve this would be to consider further strength-\nening and extending the Implementation Research\ndimensions of the Collaboration in Applied Health\nResearch and Care centers. This should also consider how\nto closely ally those researching implementation with\nthose doing implementation on a daily basis.\n7. In order to advance the research area, funding should\nbe directed towards providing opportunities for scientists\nand clinicians to meet to discuss relevant issues \u2013 akin to\nthe UK Economic and Social Research Council Seminar\nSeries Grants.\n8. NIHR should give consideration to establishing a stand-\ning advisory group, with appropriate expertise, to con-\ntinue to develop, oversee, and advise on Implementation\nResearch within the NHS. Such a body could also make\nlinks with other national centers to form an international\nnetwork.\nCompeting interests\nThe CERAG members are researchers, policy makers, or\nresearch funders in areas in some way allied to Implemen-\ntation Research.\nAuthors' contributions\nMPE convened and chaired the CERAG.
