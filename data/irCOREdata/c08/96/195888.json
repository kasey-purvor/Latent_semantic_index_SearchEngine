Microarray analysis was performed to identify genes regulated by either C-peptide and\/or TGF-\u03b21 in a human proximal tubular cell line, HK-2. Expression of retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 (RAR\u03b2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABPII), vimentin, E-cadherin, Snail, and \u03b2-catenin was assessed by immunoblotting. The cellular localization of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was determined by immunocytochemistry. Changes in cell morphology were assessed by phase contrast microscopy.

We confirmed a role for RA in reversal of TGF-\u03b21-induced changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, including expression changes in Snail, E-cadherin, vimetin, and redistribution of \u03b2-catenin.
