Introduction\nAIDS is the biggest killer in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO,\n2008a). In 2008 it accounted for 1.4 million deaths \u2013 14.7%\nof total deaths \u2013 in the region (UNAIDS\/WHO, 2009). HIV is\nhighest among economically productive adults of child-\nbearing age and has an enormous impact on families,\ncommunities, and regional economies. ART is gradually\nbeing made affordable and accessible to HIV infected\npeople across the continent predominantly through the\nprovision of free or highly subsidized antiretroviral (ARV)\ndrugs in under-resourced medical settings (WHO, 2008b).\nART is to be delivered through health centres as part of a\npackage of care that includes co-trimoxazole prophylaxis,\ncounselling, the management of opportunistic infections\nand comorbidities, and nutritional support. Following\nseveral counselling sessions, patients are initiated onto\nART by a doctor. Nurses provide themajority of subsequent\nsupport through meeting with patients at the clinic on a\nregular basis.\nART roll-out presents new opportunities and challenges\nfor healthcare providers, heralding a new era of HIV\nnursing in Africa. ART enables different types of relation-\nships between nurses and patients, characterized by\nregular interactions over many years for check-ups and\nrefills. Optimising the positive opportunities presented by\nARVs requires a greater understanding of the changes they\nbring and the supports required by patients and nurses.We\nexamine these issues through a case study of HIV-positive\npeople receiving free ARVs through three healthcare\ncentres in rural Zimbabwe. This paper explores how\npatients and nurses view the changes and challenges\nbrought about by ART.\nZimbabwe was one of the first African countries to\nshow a declining HIV rate (UNAIDS\/WHO, 2005) with the\nadult prevalence rate falling from 25% in 1997 to 13.7% in\n2009 (ZMoHCW, 2009). Despite major challenges in the\nearly 2000s, ARVs have become increasingly accessible in\nZimbabwe and by the end of 2009 the government\nsucceeded in getting over 218,000 people on ART, 56% of\nthose needing treatment (UNAIDS, 2010). Adherencethroughout sub-Saharan Africa has been found to be high\n(Amberbir et al., 2008; Bisson et al., 2008; Orrell et al.,\n2003); a recent study of Ugandan and Zimbabwean ART\npatients found that good adherence increased from 87%,\nfour weeks after ART initiation to 94% at 48weeks, but only\nhalf the patients achieved good adherence at every visit in\nthe first year (Muyingo et al., 2008).\nMaking ART accessible to the general population in sub-\nSaharan Africa is a new phenomenon presenting new\nchallenges. With treatment, HIV can be considered a\nchronic disease requiring ongoing hospital visits and a\ncarefully managed drug regime rather than a terminal\nillness requiring palliative care. A patient found HIV\npositive today, with access to ART, can expect to live 10\nyears ormore (Walensky et al., 2009).With frequent health\ncentre visits to renew prescriptions, ongoing interactions\nwith healthcare workers are becoming a routine feature of\nmany Africans\u2019 lives.\nART has renewed nurses\u2019 sense of hope but also\nincreased their workloads (Stein et al., 2007). Overworked\nnurses who lack sufficient material and emotional support\noften fall back on task- rather than patient-oriented care\n(Fassin, 2008; Manongi et al., 2009). In the paper \u2018Why do\nnurses abuse patients? Reflections from South African\nobstetric services\u2019 Jewkes, Abrahams and Mvo report that\nthe frequent and often violent abuse of patients can be\ncaused by a complex interplay of concerns including\norganizational issues (such as a lack of nurse account-\nability), professional insecurities, a perceived need to\nassert control over the environment and sanctioning of the\nuse of coercive and punitive measures to do so, and an\nunderpinning ideology of patient inferiority compared to\nthe nurses\u2019 status as middle-class professionals (1998, p.\n1781). Lewin and Green\u2019s 2009 paper \u2018Ritual and the\norganization of care in primary care clinics in Cape Town,\nSouth Africa\u2019 reports similarly fraught, although less\novertly violent, patient\u2013provider relationships. They found\nthat healthcare providers used rituals (directly observed\ntreatment of tuberculosis and daily prayer) to reinforce\nasymmetrical relations of power and to strengthen\nconventional modes of provider\u2013patient interaction, char-\nacterized by rigid hierarchy. Such problematic relation-\nships have presented significant barriers to the roll-out of\nnew healthcare regimes in Africa, such as TB treatment\n(Lewin et al., 2005) and mental healthcare (Petersen,\n1999), and could be a potential barrier to ART roll-out.\nThere has been little examination of the needs,\nexpectations and interactions of ART patients and the\nnurses who care for them. Understanding what patients\nand nurses perceive to be good ART-related clinical care\nand exploring differences in these perceptions is a vital\ncomponent of improving HIV care in poor countries. Most\nstudies on patient\u2013health worker interaction in the field of\nHIV focus on HIV\/AIDS care before ARVs were widely\navailable (e.g. Ehlers, 2006; Kohi and Horrocks, 1994). The\nstudies that do examine clinical interactions surrounding\nART are generally from rich countries (e.g. Wood et al.,\n2003) where ART has been accessible for significantly\nlonger than in developing countries such as Zimbabwe.\nResearch on ART in poor countries is very new and tends to\nfocus primarily on issues of patient non-adherence (Rosen\nTable 1\nSummary of study participants.\nParticipants Interviews FGD\nStaff 25 18 1\nCarers of children 40 21 3\nPatients 53 19 4\nTotal 118 58 8\n1 A clinical officer is healthcare worker who is trained for three years\nand received a diploma in community health, surgery and community\nmedicine. Clinical officers, unlike nurses, are licensed to prescribe\nmedicine and initiate ART in Zimbabwe.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ International Journal of Nursing Studies 48 (2011) 175\u2013183 177et al., 2007; Wringe et al., 2009) or explore the views of\neither healthworkers orHIV patients, rather than both (e.g.\nWouters et al., 2008; Stein et al., 2007).\nImproving the clinical experiences for patients and\nhealth staff in resource-poor environments is vital to\nsupport the ongoing response to HIV. Good quality\npatient\u2013health worker relationships promote adherence\n(Deyo and Inui, 1980), with recent studies extending this\nfinding to ART adherence (Roberts, 2002). Beyond adher-\nence, the importance of positive clinical experiences,\nincluding positive interactions with health workers, is\nclosely linked to patient willingness to pay for services\n(McPake, 1993) and nurse job satisfaction (Kangas et al.,\n1999).\nIt is less clear what factors lead to positive clinical\nexperiences for patients and how more positive patient\u2013\nhealth worker interactions can be fostered, particularly for\npatients onART in resource-poor settings. Efforts to improve\nthe nurse\u2013patient interface frequently fail. For example,\nnurses in Tanzania recognized they were often rough with\npatients and provided slow service but suggested these\nproblems stemed from complex issues surrounding low job\nsatisfaction and resisted simplistic sensitivity training\n(Manongi et al., 2009). Manongi et al.\u2019s study highlights\nthe need for further research into the human dynamics of\nclinical service delivery and how clashing expectations and\nneeds of staff and patients can be addressed. To this end, our\npaper will highlight how nurses and patients often have\ndifferent goals in the medical encounter, leading to stress\nand misunderstanding.\n2. Methods\nOur qualitative research involved collaboration\nbetween two British universities and a Zimbabwean public\nhealth institute. Research was conducted by four experi-\nenced fieldworkers over six weeks in 2009 in rural\nZimbabwe, focusing on three sites: a Catholic clinic, an\nAnglican hospital and a government hospital. Details of the\nregion and health settings have been anonymised to\nprotect the identity of participants.\n2.1. Context\nThe HIV rate in the region is approximately 20%\n(Gregson et al., 2006). Residents of the region are primarily\nsubsistence farmers. Most live in rural homesteads\n(compounds with several mud and thatch houses, a pit-\nlatrine and animal pens), often without electricity. Large\ncommercial farming estates in the region employ a\nsignificant portion of the local population. Many families\nhave members working in major cities, some of whom\nsend money back to the rural areas. Poverty is a major\nchallenge and many local people receive food aid from\ninternational organizations.\nAll three health centres studied had infrequent\nelectricity. The Catholic clinic relied on water from a\nnearby hand pumpwhile the other two had runningwater,\nalbeit irregularly. The government hospital had one staff\ndoctor, almost 40 nurses and approximately 40 additional\nstaff (nurse aids, counsellors, pharmacists, cleaners andadministrators); the Anglican hospital had a clinical\nofficer,1 about 50 nurses and about 30 additional staff.\nAt both sites, the doctor\/clinical officer also visited smaller\nclinics and attended meetings and workshops in the cities.\nThe bulk of patient care was provided by nurses and\ncounsellors. At the government hospital, the doctor had so\nmany commitments outside the hospital that he was only\nable to treat hospital out-patients once every two weeks.\nThe Catholic clinic was visited monthly by a doctor and\nwas otherwise staffed by nurses.\n2.2. Research design\nThe research involved interviews and focus groupswith\npatients, carers of children on ART and healthcare\nproviders (see Table 1), as well as ethnographic observa-\ntion of treatment settings.\nInterviews and focus groupswere conductedwith a total\nof 53 ARV users (19 one-hour interviews with people on\nARVs, and four two-to-three-hour focusgroupswitheight to\n10 participants) and 40 carers of children on ART (21\ninterviews and three focus groups). Since carers of children\nonARTmust attend the clinic for their child\u2019s check-ups and\nprescription refills they have similar clinical experiences as\nadult ART patients. Most participants were recruited from\nopenly HIV-positive community members known to the\nresearchers through previous HIV\/AIDS research. Others\nwere approached as they visited hospital or clinic sites. A\nfew participants approached the researchers asking to be\ninterviewed because they had heard about the project.\nResearchers\u2019 requests to interview a person on ART were\nonly refused in one case, by someone who cited time\nlimitations. Topic guides explored changing perceptions of\nHIV, social support and ways of coping with HIV and ART,\nissues surrounding treatmentadherence, andexperiencesat\nthe healthcare centre. During focus groups with patients,\nparticipants were invited to perform a role-play of \u2018a good\ndayat the clinic\u2019 and \u2018abaddayat the clinic\u2019. These role-plays\nrevealed a great deal aboutwhatmakes clinical experiences\npositive or negative for ART patients.\nInterviews and focus groups were conducted with a\ntotal of 25 health staff (nurses, HIV counsellors, pharma-\ncists and a clerk) at the three hospital\/clinic sites, and one\nfocus group was held at the Anglican hospital. A focus\ngroup at the other two sites was not possible due to staff\nshortages. Staff members had often been born in the region\nor had moved there through marriage, sharing a common\nC. Campbell et al. \/ International Journal of Nursing Studies 48 (2011) 175\u2013183178identity with patients. Researchers received permission to\nconduct the research from each health centre\u2019s doctor or\nnurse-in-charge. Staff members were then approached\nindividually to participate; all agreed. To elicit information\nabout challenges and positive elements of working with\nHIV\/AIDS patients and issues of clinic access and treatment\nadherence, nurses were asked about their views of \u2018good\u2019\nand \u2018bad\u2019 patients, sources of frustration and support in\ntheir lives and their perceptions of proper clinical care.\nOver 100 h of ethnographic observation were con-\nducted at the health centres, observing interactions as HIV\npatients waited for the doctor, paid hospital fees, visited\nthe pharmacy, and waited for nurses to review their\nprogress on ART and prescribe refills of their ARVs.\nResearchers did not observe private interactions between\npatients and staff. Observation focused on hospital activity,\nincluding interactions between patients and staff and the\narrangement of people in hospital spaces. Extensive\ndetailed notes were taken by the researchers throughout\nthe hours of observation, recording what occurred (and\nwhen), how people were organized within the clinic space\nand comments made about the experience. These notes\nwere included in the body of text data (along with focus\ngroup and interview transcripts) for analysis.\nData were collected by three Shona-speaking fieldwor-\nkers and a fourth researcher working with an interpreter.\nAll audio files were translated into English and transcribed\nby trained researchers. To thank the informants, focus\ngroup participantswere given soap, and intervieweeswere\ngiven a t-shirt.\n2.3. Thematic analysis\nThe datawere analyzed using thematic content analysis\n(Flick, 2006). Thematic network analysis is a process of\nencoding qualitative information to find, record and\ninterpret patterns in \u2018raw\u2019 text (in this case transcripts\nof interviews and focus groups and ethnographic notes\ntaken by researchers). Two researchers, working indepen-\ndently, carefully read and re-read the texts to find themes,\ncalled coding units, which describe and organize observa-\ntions, or interpret aspects of the phenomenon (i.e. nurse\u2013\npatient interactions and conceptions of \u2018good clinical\ncare\u2019). The researchers then grouped codes into larger\nthemes and compared their findings to ensure reliability.\nThese larger themes were finally grouped into five central\nthemes, which were: ideal interactions between nurses\nand patients, obedience vs. adherence, control of ARV pills,\nHIV clinic availability and \u2018grey areas.\u2019 These five themes\nprovide the sub sections for the findings reported below.\n3. Findings\nPatients andnurseswereoverwhelminglypositive about\nART and associated services. Many friendly staff\u2013patients\ninteractionswereobserved.Healthcarestaff expressedgreat\nsatisfaction at seeing patients improve and were extremely\npositive about adherence rates. They were also confident\nabout the quality of their counselling services, often\nreferring to its effectiveness in helping patients come to\nterms with the challenges of HIV and ART. Patients werehappy to have access to free life saving drugs. Many spoke\npositively about the healthcare staff, the changes in their\nlives since beginning ARVs and their adherence.\nAgainst this positive background, there were none-\ntheless challenges and difficulties, especially surrounding\nin-clinic experiences and interactions. Findings on patient\nand staff perceptions of good care were for the most part\nconsistent between the health centres and are thus\npresented together; cases where significant differences\narose are specified. One note on site differences concerns\nthe role of religion in the clinic. Some patients reported\nfinding the religious atmosphere enriching to their\nexperience, as an ART patient explains:\nThere are times when the nurses come and greet\neverybody and invite us into a room. In that room we\npray together. . .after that we will get served in a very\nfriendly fashion (Patient, Anglican hospital, focus group\n(FG))\nStaff at each site, however, generally favoured their own\ntype of institution. Nurses at the Christian sites felt\npatients preferred religious-based care. Government hos-\npital staff said secular care was better because it was free\nfrom church-related regulations.\nIt is better here because the church can provide spiritual\ncounselling, which does not happen in government\nhospitals. (Nurse, Anglican clinic, interview)I prefer working at a government hospital because the\nchurch hospital has too many church imposed regula-\ntions . . . here we only follow government regulations.\n(Nurse, government hospital, interview)\nWhilst staff seemed to favour their own type of\ninstitution, many patients praised the encouragement\nand camaraderie fostered by church-based clinics.\n3.1. Ideal interactions between nurses and patients\nAt all sites, patients and nurses spoke of the importance\nof kindness, understanding, confidentiality and stigma\nreduction. Basic friendliness came up repeatedly, with\npatients and nurses showing how a greeting from a nurse\nor an expression of gratitude from a patient was vital to\npositive clinical interactions. Beyond the frequently\nobserved friendly greetings, patients and staff commented\non the importance of these interactions:\nWe see the patients every month and serving them is a\npleasure because they are always cheerful and they ask\nquestions when they do not understand. They bring us\nbananas and whatever they have because we have built\nthat relationship with them. . . just yesterday there is a\nguy who brought me some potato chips. (Pharmacist,\ngovernment hospital, interview)\nBoth nurses and patients said listeningwas vital to good\nclinical care:\nWe listen to people\u2019s personal problems because HIV is\nmore than a medical condition (Nurse, Anglican\nhospital, interview)\nC. Campbell et al. \/ International Journal of Nursing Studies 48 (2011) 175\u2013183 179When they come here apart from getting their\ntreatments they also want to be listened to, so we try\nto give them a chance to say what they want (Nurse,\ngovernment hospital, interview)I really appreciate their kindness and they always try to\nlisten when we have issues. (Patient, Anglican hospital,\ninterview)\nPatients expressed dissatisfaction when nurses did not\nappear to listen to them:\nSometimes the nursemight just tell the patient to go on\nbed rest without even listening to what the patient has\nto say (Patient, Anglican hospital, FG)If they ask what you are suffering from, and they think\nyou are not a good patient, some nurses will not even\nlisten to what I am trying to tell them. They will just go\nahead and write what they think on my card (Patient,\ngovernment hospital, FG)\nPatients appreciated staff taking an interest in their\nlives and getting to know them over time. Nurses similarly\nemphasized that their main source of motivation was\nseeing patients improve over time and developing positive\nrelationships with them. Nurses recognized the impor-\ntance of being understanding about the difficult circum-\nstances that many HIV patients were dealing with. One\nnurse explains her compassionate approach to patients\nwho defaulted on appointments:\nSuppose a patient has missed the review date. The\nreasons that they give for missing it makes you reverse\nyour initial decision to feel frustrated or angry with\nthem. One will tell you they couldn\u2019t get transport, or\nthey could not get themoney to come, andmaybe today\nthey have borrowedmoney to be able to attend. For me\nto be dissatisfied with such a patient would mean that I\nwas not doing justice to them. It\u2019s often their life\nsituations that cause their behaviour. (Nurse, Anglican\nhospital, FG)\nAlmost all nurses said that maintaining confidentiality\nabout patients\u2019 HIV status was a core component of good\nnursing practice, expressing satisfaction with their and\ntheir colleagues\u2019 ability to achieve this. In the face of high\nlevels of HIV\/AIDS stigma in the region, patients appre-\nciated nurses treating them \u2018normally\u2019\u2014like patients with\ndifferent ailments. Handshakes featured prominently in\naccounts of positive nurse\u2013patient relationships. Shaking\nhands is a culturally accepted greeting that enables nurses\nto show they are not afraid of touching HIV-positive\npatients.\n3.2. Adherence versus obedience\nNurses and patients agreed that good clinical care\nincluded providing counselling and a supportive environ-\nment tohelp patients developoptimal adherence strategies.\nAdherence could be undermined by misunderstandings\nabout drugs, side effects, and the practical challenges of\ntaking ARVs correctly (including remembering to takemedication and accessing food to eat with drugs). The\nimportance of obeying counsellors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 directions\naround taking ARVs was emphasized by both patients and\nhealth staff. However, the line between adherence to\nmedical guidance regarding taking ARTs, and general\nobedience to nurses was sometimes blurred. Patient\ndeference to nurses onmedical issues and the assertiveness\nof nurses on these same issues were appreciated by both\nparties. However, sometimes nurses appeared to require\ndeference for its own sake, as a way of exerting authority or\naffirming their importance and superiority to patients,\nrather than for medical reasons.\nHospital staff were occasionally observed to make\nseemingly arbitrary demands that patients line up, stand\nor sit. Patients also commented on the difficulty of this\ntype of interaction:\n. . . He will be shouting different kind of instructions for\nexample \u2018\u2018make sure you are in line\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018may everyone\nsit down, I won\u2019t serve anyone standing up\u2019\u2019. The\nbenches will be full so somewill sit on the floor. . .if you\ntry to complain he might even shout at you (Patient,\ngovernment hospital, FG)\nPower inequalities between patients and healthcare\nstaff are often enacted and reinforced through the control\nof patient movement in hospital spaces (Jewkes et al.,\n1998). Telling a patient to sit down can be a kind act or,\nconversely, a means to display gratuitous control. Some\npatients referred to instances where they had felt\ndisempowered by displays of power by health staff:\nA \u2018bad nurse\u2019 may come at the bench and shout at those\nsitting there, saying: \u2018You think I\u2019m the one who caused\nyou to get sick?\u2019 and \u2018You want to be helped?\u2019 You just\nkeep quiet but you won\u2019t feel free (Patient, Catholic\nclinic, interview)3.3. Conflicting perceptions surrounding how and when to\naccess ART\nThe organization of ART programs served as the key\narea of misunderstanding between health workers and\npatients, and a key source of patient stress. When in good\nhealth, most patients sought to attend the clinic as seldom\nas possible for ARV refills and check-ups, and all wanted to\nreceive reasonably prompt care during these visits.\nHowever the ART programs in this region usually require\npatients to come for monthly ARV refills, with all ART\npatients coming on specific days, leading to bottlenecks\nand slow care. The healthcare staff have reasons for this\narrangement that are sometimes not understood or valued\nby patients; likewise it appears that the negative effects on\npatients of frequent, long visits are not always fully\nappreciated by staff. Conflicting expectations and desires\nsurrounding monthly ARV drug refills and HIV clinic days\nare discussed in turn below.\n3.3.1. Monthly ARV refills\nPatients and health staff had different perceptions of\ngood care regarding how often patients should come to the\nhospital to report to nurses and get their next instalment of\nC. Campbell et al. \/ International Journal of Nursing Studies 48 (2011) 175\u2013183180pills. Patients generally felt healthy and confident about\ntheir capacity to adhere. By contrast, nurses anticipated\nnegative side effects and adherence problems, leading\nthem to schedule frequent visits to monitor patient\nadherence and well-being. Most patients wanted several\nmonths\u2019 supply of ARVs at a time, in a context where\npeople often lived far from health centres and lacked\nmoney for transport. In addition, patients often battled to\npay a one or two dollar2 consulting fee each time they\nvisited the health centre. They also had towaitmany hours\nin several queues to pay the consultation fee, be weighed\nand have their temperature taken, see the nurse and have\nthe pharmacy fill their prescription. These health centre\nvisits sapped their already limited economic and physical\nresources. Most patient informants were proud of their\nadherence rates, eager to emphasise their understanding of\nthe importance of taking their drugs correctly:\nI personally value my health, I love my family so much\nthat I don\u2019t want to die and leave them. So I religiously\ndo what I am supposed to do to keep myself fit. . .My\nmain motive is to follow all that I am advised to do so\nthat I can look after my children (Patient, Anglican\nhospital, FG)I am sure very few people are not taking drugs as\ndirected, because these drugs will not just be given to\nanyone before they ascertain that you have been\ncounselled and understand that this is a lifelong course.\nNobody would wake up one day and say \u2018I am feeling\nbetter now so I am stopping the drugs\u2019. People really\nunderstand the value of taking these drugs as directed.\n(Patient, government hospital, FG)\nHealth staff had several reasons for prescribing one\nmonth of pills at a time. At times when ARVs were in short\nsupply, staff had to give patients fewer pills and have them\ncome back for refills more frequently. When supplies were\nadequate to give patients several months\u2019 worth of pills,\nnurses usually still gave out only one month\u2019s supply in\norder tomonitor adherence. To get their next instalment of\npills, patients must show nurses the previous month\u2019s\npackage of ARVs, which should have a few days\u2019 worth of\npill doses remaining. If the patient hasmore pills than he or\nshe should, nurses know that the patient has skipped pills\nand can intervene to improve adherence. Nurses also use\nthe monthly refill visits to ask patients about their health\nto track and deal with potential side effects or opportu-\nnistic infections. However, for stable patients with a record\nof high adherence who have been on ART for over six\nmonths, such regular check-ups can be relaxed, according\nto recent guidelines. The WHO\u2019s (2006) ART recommenda-\ntions suggest that clinical monitoring for stable patients\ncan be performed every six months.\nMisunderstandings arise because some patients think a\ngood nurse is one who prescribes several months of pills at\na time and that a bad nurse or pharmacist is someone who\ngives out smaller amounts of pills:2 In 2008, the Zimbabwe government switched to a multi-currency\nsystem within which the US dollar is the most widely used currency.One day we were discussing among ourselves after we\nwere just given twomonths supply of ARVs, so wewere\nvery happy about it saying, these nurses have been good\nto us. (Patient, Catholic clinic, FG)Patient 1: The nurses don\u2019t agree to it [giving several\nmonths\u2019 supply at once]. They only provide twomonths\nsupply for people who will be travelling away for a long\ntime, because they say they need to see us regularlyPatient 2: Even sometimes when the nurses prescribe a\ntwo months supply the pharmacist will just say \u2018\u2018I will\ngive you one month\u2019s supply\u2019\u2019. (Patients, government\nhospital, FG)\nIn the following quotation, a patient suggests that she\nreceived fewer pills as punishment for lacking money to\npay the consultation fee, despite the fact that the nurse\nexplained there was a drug shortage:\nThe habit of nurses saying \u2018there are no drugs\u2019 happens\nif you don\u2019t have the money [consultation fee]. Like the\nlast time the doctor prescribed us a full month\u2019s supply\nof ARVs, but when we went to collect these from the\nnurse, she said \u2018Is your doctor normal? How can he\nallow you to get so many tablets? Where does he think\nwe get the drugs?\u2019 And she gave a smaller supply,\nsaying \u2018these are the last pillswe have in stock\u2019. (Patient,\nCatholic clinic, FG)\nAs the following quotation illustrates, nurses and\npharmacists frequently do not have the supplies for larger\ndoses and feel that patients fail to understand this\nlimitation.\nSometimes they just say they want a two months\u2019\nsupply. . . they come up with all sorts of reasons and yet\nit affects us whenwe order from the AIDS and TB unit in\nHarare. They will not understand this. Some have got\ngenuine reasons but some just want a two months\u2019\nsupply just for the sake of it being possible (Pharmacist,\ngovernment hospital, interview)\nIn this way, many staff felt that seeking to limit clinic\nvisits was not, in itself, a credible reason for wanting\nseveral months dose at once\u2014a patient must have some\nadditional reason such as travelling out of the region.\nOur study suggests that monthly refills deplete the\nenergy of patients, involving patients in unnecessary and\nunaffordable expenditure on consultation fees and trans-\nport. However, in addition to drug supply irregularities, it\nseems that nurses perceive good clinical care to include\nnotions of surveillance, in contrast to patients who see\nfrequent visits as a hindrance to their well-being.\n3.3.2. HIV clinic availability\nAnother area of stress and conflict between patients\nand staff centred around long wait times at healthcare\nsites. Staff had several reasons for only offering ART review\ndates (check-up and refill times) on one or two days of the\nweek, rather than spreading appointments throughout the\nweek. Staff felt that focusing on particular health condi-\ntions on particular dayswasmore efficient because it saves\nC. Campbell et al. \/ International Journal of Nursing Studies 48 (2011) 175\u2013183 181them from having to flip back and forth through different\npatient and drug registers. This arrangement also facil-\nitates pharmacy efficiency, enabling them to package and\naccount for the ARVs all at once. Nurses use the quieter,\nnon-ART days to catch up on paperwork.\nIn contrast, patients dread these ART days. Since they\nare seen on a first-come-first-served basis people must\narrive extremely early in themorning andwait for hours in\nvery long queues, often of up to 40 people. A sense of fear\nand dread pervades these queues as patients scramble to\nkeep their place in line and worry about not seeing the\nnurse before closing hours. Patients occasionally tried to\navoid the long queues by coming on non-ART days:\nSome people do avoid coming on their review dates\nbecause they know the queue will be very long here so\ntheywould come two or three days laterwhen the clinic\nwill not be very busy (Nurse, government hospital,\ninterview)\nPatients reported that if they try to avoid the long queue\nby coming on a non-ART day the nurses demand an\nappropriate explanation (such as illness or funeral\nattendance), and that they seldom \u2018got away with this\u2019\nmore than once.\nWhile some nursesmentioned the importance of seeing\npatients in a timely manner, most appeared not to\nappreciate the severe discomfort associated with these\nqueues and waiting times for each refill. Staff occasionally\neven suggested that dedicated ART days benefited patients,\nenabling them to meet with one another and discuss their\ncondition:\nWhen they come, they sit on the benches and start to\ndiscuss their issues. Sometimeswewould be calling out\nnames yet they would be busy discussing their issues.\nThey are so happy one of them said when we meet we\nhave a lot to share and this disease has created friends\nfor us. . . it is good that they have their special day, they\nmeet and discuss all their issues. . . I am sure they are\nkeen to come here and spend the whole day discussing\ntheir issues (Nurse, government hospital, interview)\nThis sentiment failed to resonatewith ART patientswho\nfelt fast service was central to good care and who have\nplenty of opportunities to discuss their conditions in local\nHIV support groups.\n3.4. Grey areas surrounding payments and access to service\n\u2018Grey areas\u2019 in policy (i.e. where rules exist but are\nwidely known to bend) lead to stress, take up time and\nfoster negative interactions between staff and patients.\nThere are two clear examples of these problematic grey\nareas, where patients and staff have different expectations\nand needs which are mediated by ambiguous rules:\npayment for medicine and consultation, and access to\nmedical service.\nAs mentioned above, each site charges a one or two\ndollar consultation fee. In addition, all medication other\nthan ARVs and co-trimoxazole (a pre-ARV), such as drugs\nfor opportunistic infections, must be purchased bypatients, since the hospitals do not receive thesemedicines\nfree through government or charity organizations. How-\never, having to pay is not an unbendable rule. Sometimes\npatients are denied service or drugs if they cannot pay;\nother times, the fee is waived or turned into a debt.\nSometimes patients are referred to the accounts depart-\nment and after negotiation are given permission to receive\nservice or drugs for free. Patients often lamented that,\nregardless of whether fees were completely waived or not,\nthey were subject to harsh, off-putting treatment if they\ncould not pay up-front:\nThey will say \u2018How can you just walk up here and say\nstamp my card without money?\u2019 . . .They say \u2018You have\nto pay the dollar\u2019. And when we say \u2018No but we don\u2019t\nhave the money\u2019, they respond \u2018so do you want me to\npay for you?\u2019 Then they refer us to the accounts section.\nSo even if we go on to get good service from the nurse\nwe would have been destabilized already (Patient,\ngovernment hospital, FG)\nPatients and staff both recognized a lack of clear\nguidelines on the procedure for patientswho cannot pay; it\noften depends on the individual staff members working\nthat day or the persuasiveness of the patients. This\nambiguity leads to many stressful interactions where\npatients plead for free care or medicine and nurses try to\nbalance their desire to help to poor patients with the need\nto collect revenue for the health centre:\nWe are also human beings so we hear all these stories,\npeople come with all their different stories and excuses\non why they should be exempted from paying for their\ntablets. Some of these stories also cause us a great deal\nof stress (Nurse, Anglican hospital, interview)\nIn a role-play performed by ART patients in a focus\ngroup, participants portrayed a nurse trying to send away\nsomeone who could not afford the consultation fee. But\nafter further pleading, she relented. Another patient\ndescribes how a \u2018good nurse\u2019 will coach the patient on\nhow best to present his or her case to the administration,\nfor example by advising them to ask for the fee to be made\ninto a debt rather than waived.\nThe ambiguity surrounding payment for drugs and\nconsultation causes stress not only between patients and\nstaff but also within different departments of the hospital.\nWhen nurses or clerks, who control up-front payments,\nwaive fees they often face reprimands from the accounts\ndepartment. In the following quotation a nurse explains\nthis tension:\nWith accounts I think understanding each other is\ndifficult. We needmoney whenwe are at accounts. So if\na patient comes and you give her credit, then she comes\nagain you give her another credit, the administratorwill\ndisapprove of that (Nurse pharmacist, Anglican hospi-\ntal, FG)\nAccess to service presents another area that leads to\nconflict. There is a general understanding that the doctor\nand nurses are seen on a first-come-first-served basis.\nHowever, this system is occasionally circumvented,\nC. Campbell et al. \/ International Journal of Nursing Studies 48 (2011) 175\u2013183182particularly at the government hospital and particularly\nwhen waiting for the doctor, where the stakes are higher\nthan waiting for nurses since the doctor is available so\nrarely. Doctor hours are limited and there are often lines of\nover 40 people to see the doctor in a 2-h window. Patients\nare sometimes advanced in line by nurses because they are\nrelated to the nurse, due to severity of the illness, or\nbecause they are with children, as the quotation below\ndiscusses.\nAs youmight know people have become very corrupt. If\nyou have relativesworking there, then youwill avoid all\nthese queues and just come in front and get served\nwhile we spent the whole day waiting. (Patient,\ngovernment hospital, FG)\nSince the justifications for changing the order are\nflexible, patients feel very worried about losing their\nposition and sometimes try to assert their position in line\naggressively.\n4. Conclusion\nThis paper has explored the perspectives of ART\npatients and nurses on what constitutes good clinical care\nin the context of ongoing HIV\/AIDS management through\nARV provision. We have sought to illustrate how conflict-\ning expectations in ART-related clinical encounters can\nlead to stressful and unsatisfying nurse\u2013patient interac-\ntions. To this end, we have presented findings that detail\nspecific areas where nurses and patients hold different\nconceptions of good clinical care and different priorities for\nclinical interactions.\nHealthcare staff often sought evidence of patient\nobedience and respect. Whilst nurses seemed to regard\nthese displays as facilitators of adherence and service\nefficiency, patients often found these demands for obedi-\nence disheartening. In some cases, nurses also appeared to\nhavesoughtevidenceof theirpoweroverpatients inorder to\ncope with the day-to-day stress and disempowerment of\nworking in resource limited and somewhat unpredictable\nenvironments. As mentioned in the introduction, attempts\nto use sensitization training to address abusive and\ndisrespectful staff behaviour in resource-poor settings have\nproved challenging (e.g. Manongi et al., 2009). Without\naddressing root issues, such as chronic stress surrounding\nshortages of staff, drugs and equipment alongside a lack of\nrespect between different healthcare cadres and low staff\naccountability, it appears difficult to change healthcare\nworker behaviour towards patients. However, the fact that\nhigh quality care dominated in our study and that many of\nthe instances of problematic staff\u2013patient interaction were\nlinked more to differing expectations than ill-will shows\nthat resource limitations and compassionate nursing can go\nhand-in-hand. Greater insight into the factors that facilitate\nsuch compassionate nursingwill help support future efforts\nto foster positive staff\u2013patient relationships in resource-\npoor settings.\nPatients favoured an ART program where visits to the\nhospital or clinic were quick and less frequent. Nurses\nfrequently overlooked or failed to concern themselveswith\nthe importance of fast service and the difficulties patientsfaced to attend hospital frequently; instead, they prior-\nitized careful, systematic and regular adherence surveil-\nlance and evidence of patient respect. Finding strategies to\nspeed up patient visits on review days (perhaps by\nreviewing ART on more than one or two days a week or\nincreasing staff on high-capacity days) would go a long\nway towards alleviating a key source of patient stress.\nAmbiguity surrounding various elements of hospital\nadministration (especially paying for services\/drugs and\norder of access to the doctor and nurses) lead to prolonged\nnegotiations between staff and patients. Considering that\nalmost every patient is poor and in serious need of nurse or\ndoctor assistance, staff members struggle to choose who to\nassist financially and who to prioritize in line. Add to that\nthe pressure to help relatives and friends and it becomes\nclear that healthcare staff deal with many conflicting\ndemands on a regular basis at work, for example, between\nmeeting patient needs and generating much needed\nrevenue for their health centre.\nHere we re-emphasise that the challenges facing staff\nand patients as ART becomes a lifelong reality for tens of\nthousands of Zimbabweans must be understood in the\ncontext of the overwhelmingly positive reception of ART in\nthe region. Overall, patients were extremely optimistic\nabout their prospects of living on ART and their capacities\nto adhere to treatment. Praise for staff kindness were far\nmore commonplace than any type of complaint, a great\ntestament to the commitment and capacities of these\nhealth staff who work in severely under-resourced\nsettings. Likewise, staff were overwhelmingly optimistic\nabout ARVs and expressed confidence in their ability to\nprovide good quality care.\nThis case study takes into account the views of both\npatients and healthcare providers to explore the challenges\nof ART provision in a resource-poor setting. We have\nsought to develop a more complete picture of why nurses\nand patients behave the ways they do and how their\ndiffering priorities play into their levels of satisfactionwith\nclinical interactions. Our findings contribute to the\nliterature on best practice in the era of ART by suggesting\nthat, contrary to the more common research concerns\nabout non-adherence and nurse burn out, clinical care that\nsatisfies ART patients and nurses hinges on finding ways to\nunderstand and address differing nurse and patient needs\nand priorities.\nThe role of underlying Christian values and links to\nchurches warrants further investigation as findings from\nthis study suggest that patients appreciate the spiritual\ndimension of the care and sense of solidarity offered by\nChristian healthcare facilities. The fact that ART was\nrelatively new to our study sites (having begun slightly\nover a year prior to the study) limits our understanding of\nthe longer-term evolution of patient-provider relation-\nships in the era of ART. A follow-up study in 2012 that\nrevisits the same healthcare sites plans to provide further\ninsights into the long-term clinical interactions necessi-\ntated by ART. Such a study will seek to further our\nunderstanding of HIV nursing in the era of ART by\nilluminating whether our findings reflect the ongoing\npractice of ART clinical care or initial excitement and\nuncertainty related to the early stages of ART roll-out.\nC.

Our findings add to the\nglobal discussion of best practice in HIV care by high-\nlighting the ways in which contrasting priorities of\npatients and nurses can lead to dissatisfaction.\nFunding source\nThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust.\nRole of the funding source\nTheWellcome Trust played no role in the conduct of the\nresearch or the preparation of the article.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nEthical approval\nEthical approval for the study was granted by the\nMedical Research Council of Zimbabwe (Ref: A\/681) and\nthe Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (Ref:\nICREC_9_3_13).\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to all the research participants.\nWe also wish to thank Cynthia Chirwa, Samuel Mahunze,\nEdith Mupandaguta, Reggie Mutsindiri, Kundai Nhongo,\nZivai Mupambireyi and Simon Zidanha for logistic,\ntranslation, transcription and research assistance.
