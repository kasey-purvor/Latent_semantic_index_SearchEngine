INTRODUCTION\nSpin relaxation in semiconductor quantum dots is cur-\nrently under intense investigation because of its relevance to\nsolid state quantum computing. Pioneering experiments by\nFujisawa et al.1 have shown that the triplet-singlet relaxation\nrate in elliptical dots is very low, and this has been confirmed\nfor other dot types and transitions.2,3 Theoretical work on\nspin flip processes was initiated by Khaetskii and Nazarov4\nwho studied excited state to ground state transitions in one-\nelectron circular and elliptical dots. They examined possible\nspin relaxation mechanisms and showed that linear spin mix-\ning is the dominant one. Since then, excited to ground state\ntransitions caused by spin mixing in various one-electron dot\nmodels have been studied theoretically5,6 as have transitions\nbetween Zeeman sublevels.7\u20139 However, most theoretical\nwork so far has focused on idealized dot models, which do\nnot include a realistic confinement potential, electron-\nelectron interactions, and screening. The aim of the present\nwork is to investigate these effects in a vertical pillar dot, the\nsame class of device as used in the experiments of Fujisawa\net al.1 As far as the authors are aware, there is only one other\npaper concerned with spin relaxation in a real device10 but\nthis centers on a lateral dot which is very different from the\nvertical dot considered here.\nThe present work has been made possible by the develop-\nment of an accurate device model in which confinement and\nscreening parameters are obtained by fitting to experimental\ndata.11,12 This leads to addition energies that agree with ex-\nperimental data to around 5%, so the model is considered to\nbe a reliable description of the individual dot used to fit the\nmodel parameters and should also give reliable information\nabout spin relaxation in the vertical class of device. How-\never, the only device whose model parameters are known has\ncircular symmetry while the device used by Fujisawa et al.\nhas elliptical symmetry, so the present work is only appli-\ncable to the class of device used by Fujisawa et al. and not to\nthe individual dot used by them. It would be possible to\napply the present approach to the individual device used by\nFujisawa et al. if it was characterized in the same way11 as\nthe device considered here. The main finding of the present\nwork is that the spin relaxation rate in the realistic model\ndiffers from rates calculated in idealized models by up to 4\norders of magnitude. In addition, the relaxation rate varies\nextremely rapidly with dot thickness, like 1\/w18 in zero mag-\nnetic field and 1\/w10 in a nonzero field. Consequently, a\nrelatively small increase in dot thickness could suppress the\nlinear spin mixing mechanism so that it is no longer domi-\nnant. This should make it possible to engineer a dot so that it\nhas an extremely low triplet-singlet relaxation rate. However,\nrelaxation in this regime would be dominated by effects such\nas the hyperfine interaction and coupling to the phonon strain\nfield, which are thought to be small but have not yet been\ninvestigated in a realistic device model.\nII. THEORY\nThe system considered here is an electrostatic pillar dot\ncontaining two interacting electrons. The dot is defined in a\npillar which has heavily doped contacts at its top and bottom.\nThe vertical confinement is provided by a finite depth, sym-\nmetric quantum well, of width w, and the lateral confinement\nis parabolic.13 There is a magnetic field, B, perpendicular to\nthe plane of the dot. The electron wave function is taken to\nhave the form \u0001\u0001z1\u0002\u0001\u0001z2\u0002\u0002, where \u0001 is the vertical envelope\nfunction and \u0002 depends only on lateral and spin coordinates.\n\u0002 is found from an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian,\nH=HNI+HI+HSO. HNI consists of the kinetic energy, para-\nbolic confinement potential, and Zeeman energy. The aver-\nage effective mass, m* for the GaInAs\u2013AlGaAs quantum\nwell used to fabricate pillar dots13 ranges from 0.0673m0 to\n0.0648m0 for well widths in the range 5\u201350 nm. The para-\nbolic confinement energy is 4.82 meV and the effective g\nfactor, \u0003g* \u0003 =0.3. HI is the Coulomb interaction averaged\nover the vertical confinement and modified by the screening\neffect of the heavily doped contacts. The screening is found\nfrom the electrostatic Green\u2019s function12 and the screening\nlength, 15.3 nm, in the contacts is derived from experimental\ndata.11 The dominant spin-orbit coupling mechanism in ver-\ntical pillar dots is the linear Dresselhaus mechanism. HSO\ntherefore consists of the terms in the Dresselhaus spin-orbit\ncoupling Hamiltonian that are linear in the lateral momen-\ntum, HSO=\u0003\u0004pz\n2\u0005\u0001\u0004y\u0005y \u2212\u0004x\u0005x\u0002 \/\u00063, where \u0001=p\u0006+eA, p is\nthe momentum, A is the magnetic vector potential, \u0004pz\n2\u0005\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 75, 035323 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/75\u00013\u0002\/035323\u00016\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society035323-1\n= \u0004\u0001 \u0003pz\n2 \u0003\u0001\u0005, \u0002 are the Pauli matrices and \u0003 is a material\nparameter14 whose value is in the range 26.2\u201327.5 eV \u00c53 for\nwell widths in the range 5\u201350 nm.\nAlthough the linear Dresselhaus mechanism is the domi-\nnant source of spin-orbit coupling in pillar dots there are two\nother smaller effects, the cubic order Dresselhaus mechanism\nand the Rashba mechanism. The Rashba mechanism is im-\nportant in systems with structural inversion asym-\nmetry10,15\u201318 but the source of vertical confinement in the\npresent system is an inversion symmetric quantum well. This\nis embedded in a pillar which stands on a substrate. This\nmacroscopic device structure does not have inversion sym-\nmetry, but the dot is about an order of magnitude smaller\nthan the pillar. Hence, symmetry breaking effects in the dot\nare expected to be weak. So, the Rashba coupling parameter\nfor the present device is probably small but its actual value is\nnot known. One effect of Rashba coupling is to change the\nground state singlet-triplet transition from a crossing to an\nanticrossing.10,17 However, the main focus of the present\nwork is on triplet-singlet relaxation and this occurs at fields\nbelow the singlet-triplet transition.\nAn important property of HSO is that it commutes with\nLz\u2212Sz, where Lz and Sz, respectively, are the z components of\nthe total orbital and spin angular momentum. This is used\nextensively in the present work to block diagonalize H and\ncalculate rates accurately. The block diagonalization enables\nthe eigenstates of H to be labeled by the eigenvalues of\nLz\u2212Sz and it is convenient to take these eigenvalues to be\n\u2212\u0006 ls, where ls is a quantum number. The authors are\nnot aware of this block diagonalization being used before,\nbut it is needed to avoid systematic errors in numerically\ncalculated rates for interacting systems.\nSpin relaxation occurs when the eigenstates of H are\ncoupled by the electron-phonon interaction. Each state con-\ntains a small minority spin component and this results in\ntransitions that are forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit\ncoupling. The rate of transitions R between state \u0002i and \u0002 f\nis found from the Fermi golden rule and has the general form\nR = C\u0001q0\u0002\u0007N\u0001q0\u0002 + 1\b\t\n0\n\u0005\nF\u0001\n2 \u0001q0,\u0007\u0002F\u0006\n2\u0001q\u0006\u0002f\u0001\u0007\u0002sin \u0007d\u0007 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere F\u0006\u0001q\u0006\u0002= \u0004\u0002 f \u0003\nk=1\n2 exp\u0001\u2212iq\u0006 \u00b7rk\u0002 \u0003\u0002i\u0005 and N is the\nBose-Einstein factor \u0001the temperature is 1 K\u0002.

This result generalizes to\ntriplet-singlet relaxation in a dot containing two interacting\nelectrons; however, special precautions are needed to repro-\nduce the perturbation theory results numerically. The eigen-\nstates of HNI are the Fock-Darwin states, \u0003n , l\u0005, where n and\nD. CHANEY AND P. A. MAKSYM PHYSICAL REVIEW B 75, 035323 \u00012007\u0002\n035323-2\nl are radial and angular momentum quantum numbers. The\nangular momentum factor as a function of the polar angle \u0010\nis exp\u0001\u2212il\u0010\u0002. The first order correction to \u0003n , l , \u2191 \u0005 is\n\u2212iar exp\u0001\u2212i\u0010\u0002 \u0003n , l , \u2193 \u0005, where a=m*\u0003\u0004pz2\u0005 \/\u00064 and the first or-\nder correction to \u0003n , l , \u2193 \u0005 is \u2212iar exp\u0001i\u0010\u0002 \u0003n , l , \u2191 \u0005. Thus, the\nangular momentum of the first order correction differs from\nthe angular momentum of the unperturbed state by one unit.\nSo if the eigenstates of H are found by numerical diagonal-\nization in a truncated Fock-Darwin basis, HSO couples some\nof the states in the basis to states outside the basis. Therefore,\nthe numerical results are contaminated by systematic error,\nand this problem is severe when the electrons interact be-\ncause HI mixes states with different single electron momenta\nand propagates the error from the \u201cedges\u201d of the basis to all\nthe calculated eigenstates. This error is eliminated by using\nthe eigenstates of HNI+HSO as a basis for diagonalizing H.\nThen each basis state is correct to high order in \u0003 and the\ncalculated rates are consistent with the results of perturbation\ntheory. Typically the two-electron basis is constructed from\none-electron states with \u0003ls \u0003\u000e11\/2 and 12 one-electron\nstates are used for each ls value. Then the Hamiltonian ma-\ntrix dimension is typically a few hundred and the calculated\nrates are accurate to between 0.1% and a few percent, with\nthe largest relative error in regions where the rates are both\nsmall and rapidly varying.\nThe eigenstates of HNI+HSO are calculated by numerical\ndiagonalization in the Fock-Darwin basis. The form of these\nstates is constrained by the requirement that they are also\neigenstates of Lz\u2212Sz, and this enables all the necessary an-\ngular momentum states to be included in each basis state.\nThe required states have the form \u0001\nnfn \u0003n , l\u0005\u0002 \u0003 \u2191 \u0005\n+ i\u0001\nngn \u0003n , l+1\u0005\u0002 \u0003 \u2193 \u0005, where fn and gn are real coefficients.\nWhen ls\u00110, writing the coefficient vector in the form\n\u0001f0 ,g0 , f1 ,g1 , . . . \u0002 leads to a real tridiagonal eigenvalue prob-\nlem. For ls\u000e0 the order \u0001g0 , f0 ,g1 , f1 , . . . \u0002 leads to a similar\nproblem. The convergence is rapid and only states with n\n\u00126 are needed.\nIII. RESULTS\nThe low-lying energy levels of the interacting two-\nelectron system with well width 12 nm are shown in the top\nframe of Fig. 1 as a function of B. Below the singlet-triplet\ntransition \u0001B\u00103.8 T\u0002 the ground state has ls=0 and the first\nexcited state has ls=2. The transition studied here \u0001arrow\u0002 is\nbetween the lowest ls=2 level and the lowest ls=0 level and\ncorresponds to triplet-singlet relaxation when the field is\n\u00133.8 T. The region of the singlet-triplet transition is shown\nin the inset to the top frame of Fig. 1. Three Zeeman split\nlevels lie close together in energy. There is a second crossing\nnear 3.9 T with an anticrossing near 4.05 T. In the presence\nof Rashba coupling the crossing at the singlet-triplet transi-\ntion would become an anticrossing.10,17\nThe rates of triplet-singlet relaxation via the deformation\npotential interaction are shown in the bottom frame of Fig. 1\nas a function of w. The rates for B=0 T and B=1 T oscillate\nand decrease rapidly with w but the rate for B=0 T is smaller\nand decreases faster than the rate for B=1 T. The rapid de-\ncrease can be understood by considering the regime of large\nw. The solution to Eq. \u00013\u0002 in this regime has the form kw\n\u0011\u0005\u00011+\u0014\u0002, where \u0014 is O\u00011\/w\u0002. This approximation is valid\nprovided Ez\u0015V0 and allows F\u0001 to be approximated provided\nthat \u0014q\u0001w \/2\u0015\u0005\u00122; both conditions are satisfied for the pa-\nrameter values considered here.

F\u0001 clearly oscillates with w and\ndecreases like 1\/w3. So F\u0001\n2 decreases with a 1\/w6 envelope.\nThe spin-orbit coupling parameter \u0003\u0004pz\n2\u0005 decreases like 1\/w2\nin the large w regime. For B=0 T, the first and second order\ncontributions to F\u0006 vanish.

Figure 1 shows that the numerical results for B=0\nare consistent with the asymptotic scaling when w\u001745 nm.\nFor B=1 T, the first order contribution to F\u0006 does not vanish\nand the asymptotic scaling is 1 \/w10, consistent with Fig. 1. A\ndecrease of rate with w for single electron relaxation from\nZeeman sublevels in an infinite barrier dot is reported in Ref.\n9. However, the corresponding w scaling law is not discussed\nso it is difficult to compare this case with the present results.\nThe rate oscillations are caused by zeros in F\u0001. The as-\nsociation between rate minima and zeros of F\u0001 has already\nbeen made.9,19 However, F\u0001 appears under an integral and,\nas far as the authors are aware, no explanation has been\nFIG. 1.

The physical\nreason is that most phonons are emitted nearly perpendicular\nto the plane of the dot. This is a consequence of the form of\nF\u00062. Each single particle factor, \u0004\f \u0003exp\u0001\u2212iq\u0006 \u00b7r\u0002 \u0003\r\u0005 in Eq. \u00012\u0002\nhas the form exp\u0001\u2212\u00182q\u00062 \/2\u0002p\u0001q\u0006\u0002, where p is a polynomial,\n\u00182= \u0006 \/2m*\u0019, \u00192=\u001a0\n2+\u001ac\n2 \/4, \u0006\u001a0 is the confinement energy,\nand \u001ac is the cyclotron frequency. Hence, F\u00062 has the form\nexp\u0001\u2212\u00182q0\n2sin2\u0007\u0002P\u0001\u0018q0sin \u0007\u0002, where P is another polynomial.\nFor B\u00132 T, q0\u0018 is typically \u00111 and the exponential factor\nmakes F\u00062 small unless \u0007 is also small. Hence, most of the\nweight in the integral in Eq. \u00011\u0002 comes from the small \u0007\nrange where the exponential is large. A rate minimum occurs\nwhen this \u0007 range contains a zero of F\u0001. The zeros are\nsmeared out because F\u0001 appears under the integral in Eq. \u00011\u0002\nbut the smearing is small because of the small \u0007 range, so the\nrate reduction near a zero is significant, about two orders of\nmagnitude.\nThe inset in Fig. 1 illustrates the importance of the per-\npendicular form factor for the magnitude of the relaxation\nrate. The solid lines show rates for B=0 T and B=1 T for the\nfinite barrier case and these rates are identical to those shown\nin the main part of the figure. The dashed lines show rates\ncalculated with the same parameters but with the finite bar-\nrier replaced by an infinite one. The infinite barrier model\nhas been used widely as an idealized dot model \u0001Refs. 9 and\n16, for example\u0002 but it is clear that the rates are overesti-\nmated in this model, typically by around two orders of mag-\nnitude and by about 4 orders of magnitude at worst. The\nreason is that \u0001\u0001z\u0002 is broader in the finite barrier case. This\nreduces \u0004pz\n2\u0005 and has a dramatic effect on the rates.\nFigure 2 shows the effect of the interaction between the\nelectrons. The two solid lines are identical to the rates shown\nin the main part of Fig. 1 and include the effect of the inter-\naction. The dashed lines show the results of repeating the\ncalculations with the interaction excluded. The interaction\naffects \bE and F\u00062 and this increases the rates by 1 to 3 orders\nof magnitude. The effect on \bE is a decrease by a factor of\nabout 2. This shifts the minima and increases the product\nC\u0001q0\u0002F\u0001\n2 \u00161\/q0\n3\n. The interaction affects F\u00062 by a factor of\n1.5\u20134 and the effect can be an increase or a decrease,\ndepending on B. However, the net effect of the interaction\nfor most values of w is to increase the rates.\nThe effect of different electron-phonon interaction mecha-\nnisms is illustrated in Fig. 3. The figure shows the total rate\nof relaxation via the deformation potential, longitudinal pi-\nezoelectric and transverse piezoelectric interactions together\nwith the deformation potential and total piezoelectric contri-\nbutions. The figure illustrates the typical behavior in the re-\ngimes of large and small \bE. The different behavior results\nfrom the factor C\u0001q0\u0002 in Eq. \u00011\u0002. The q0\n3 factor in the defor-\nmation potential case ensures that the deformation potential\ninteraction dominates when \bE is large and the curves for\nB=0 T illustrate this; the total and deformation potential\nrates are indistinguishable except close to the rate minima.\nThe curves for B=3.25 T illustrate the opposite regime. This\nmagnetic field is close to the singlet-triplet transition so \bE\nis small throughout the entire w range. However, the singlet-\ntriplet transition moves to higher field as w increases because\nthe increasing electron separation weakens the effect of the\ninteraction. Hence, \bE increases slowly with w. Conse-\nquently, the piezoelectric interaction is dominant in the small\nw regime where \bE is smallest and a crossover to a defor-\nmation potential dominated regime occurs at w\u001322 nm. The\npiezoelectric interaction was found to dominate in single\nelectron relaxation from Zeeman sublevels in a GaAs dot\nwith infinite barrier confinement,9 but both piezoelectric and\ndeformation potential dominated regimes occur in the\npresent triplet-singlet case because of the relatively large \bE\nvariation that occurs when w and B are varied.\nThe magnetic field dependence of the total rate, including\nall deformation potential and piezoelectric contributions, is\nshown in Fig. 4. Below the singlet-triplet transition \u0001B\n\u00103.8 T for w=12 nm and B\u00104.3 T for w=24 nm\u0002 there are\noscillations similar to those in Fig. 1. They are very pro-\nnounced for w=24 nm because the q\u0001 distance between ze-\nros decreases with w. This can be seen by considering the\nlarge w approximation to F\u0001, Eq. \u00014\u0002. Within this approxi-\nmation the zeros occur when \u00011\u2212\u0014\u0002q0w cos \u0007 \/2=n\u0005.\nAnd since \u0014 is small \u0001\u000e0.15 when w\u001724 nm\u0002 and\ncos \u0007\u00131, the difference between q0 at successive zeros is\napproximately 2\u0005 \/w. This decreases with w so the number\nof zeros, hence rate minima, increases, as illustrated in the\nFIG. 2. Comparison of spin relaxation rates for interacting and\nnoninteracting systems.\nFIG. 3. Comparison of rates of spin relaxation via deformation\npotential and piezoelectric scattering.\nD. CHANEY AND P. A. MAKSYM PHYSICAL REVIEW B 75, 035323 \u00012007\u0002\n035323-4\nfigure. Oscillations similar to those in Fig. 4 have been re-\nported for energy relaxation in double dots19 and relaxation\nbetween Zeeman sub-levels9 but the present analysis shows\nthat the effect should occur in any system where F\u0001 has\nzeros, provided that \bE is of appropriate magnitude. The\nresults in Fig. 4 suggest that a wide well is the best choice\nfor experimental observation of the rate oscillations. Beyond\nthe singlet-triplet transition there is a peak in the rate which\nis associated with the anticrossing shown in the inset of the\ntop frame of Fig. 1 and at the transition there is deep mini-\nmum. This structure would change in the presence of Rashba\ncoupling. Strong Rashba coupling is known to cause a rate\npeak at the singlet-triplet transition 10 in lateral dots but the\neffect is likely to be weaker in the device considered here.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe rate of triplet-singlet relaxation via spin mixing has\nbeen studied with a realistic two-electron dot model. The rate\noscillates with w in an envelope that scales approximately\nlike 1\/w18 when B=0 T and 1\/w10 when B\u00010. This means\na small increase in w can put a dot into a regime where the\nlinear Dresselhaus spin mixing mechanism is suppressed dra-\nmatically. Spin relaxation in this regime should be dominated\nby other mechanisms, such as the third order Dresselhaus\nmechanism,4 coupling to the phonon strain field,4 or the hy-\nperfine interaction.21 All these mechanisms involve interac-\ntion with phonons but in each case F\u0006 does not depend sig-\nnificantly on w. So the rates scale like 1\/w6 in the first two\ncases and 1\/w5 in the third, hence they must become domi-\nnant when w is sufficiently large. Although detailed investi-\ngations for the device considered here have not yet been\ndone, the available results4,21 suggest that the rate for each\nmechanism greatly exceeds the rate for the linear Dressel-\nhaus mechanism in the large w regime. It is also possible that\nRashba coupling could affect the rate but this effect is likely\nto be small in the nearly symmetric device considered here.\nExperiments on the w or B dependence of the rate could be\nused to test the present theory but, because of the very high\nsensitivity of the rate to w and \bE, this would require an\nextremely well characterized dot.\nWhile this work was being prepared for publication, a\npreprint was received from Pietil\u00e4inen and Chakraborty.22 As\npart of a study of magneto-optics, they have developed a\nmethod to diagonalize the Hamiltonian with Rashba spin-\norbit coupling which is similar to the method developed here\nfor the Dresselhaus case.\nWe have recently received a preprint from Climente et\nal.23 who have studied triplet-singlet relaxation in two and\nfour electron parabolic dots. Their results for two electrons\nare consistent with those presented here.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank M. Roy for critically reading the manuscript\nand making useful comments.
