PEASNELL, L.C.L. SKERRATT AND P.A. TAYLOR*\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis paper examines the methods currently employed to assess investment\nperformance in the light of recent developments in the theory of capital asset\npricing. There have been a considerable number of studies in the last decade on\nwhether or not mutual funds' are able to achieve superior investment performance\n(\"beat the market\" in some sense). The verdict is virtually unanimous : mutual\nfunds do not consistently outperform the market. This evidence is having a\ntraumatic impact on the US securities industry, resulting in proposals for\nfar-reaching changes in the management and organisation of mutual funds. The\nvalidity of these research findings is, of course, dependent on the appropriateness\nof the methodology underlying the empirical tests. Recent work by Roll (20),\nRoss (21) and Fama (7) suggests that the methodology is suspect and can yield\nhighly misleading results. Our purpose is to assess this claim and to see whether anything\ncan be rescued. We argue that the damage is not as serious as first appearances\nsuggest.\nThe paper is organised as follows. The next section outlines (i) the state of the art of\nempirical research into fund performance, with particular reference to the\nmethodology employed by Jensen (12) in this pathbreaking study and (ii) the main\nfeatures of Roll's critique of Jensen's methodology. Section III provides a different\ninterpretation of the Jensen study, based on the theory of arbitrage, which goes\nsome way to meeting Roll's criticisms. An arbitrage-based test procedure has\nthe additional advantage of being able to be extended to deal with industry effects\non security returns. Section IV considers a hitherto little recognised problem\nconcerning the mechanics of securing excess investment returns which has\nimplications for the measurement of beta. The section also reports some new\nempirical evidence, obtained by reworking some of Jensen's findings in order to\nfacilitate the interpretation of his study in terms of arbitrage theory. Section V\nsummarises the paper's contribution and suggests promising avenues for future\nresearch.\n*K. V.

THE STATE OF THE ART\nFrom the investment community's viewpoint, the primary purpose of measuring\nmutual fund performance is to assess the quality of the service provided to\ninvestors : the funds charge investors with commissions to finance administration\nand research expenses, and the obvious question to ask is, \"Do investors get value\nfor money?\" Additionally, from society's viewpoint there is the need to know\nwhether or not mutual funds are furthering the efficient allocation of resources.\nThe aspect of mutual fund performance which has commanded most attention\nis whether or not fund managers have access to superior information (from either inside\nknowledge or superior analysis) to other investors - testing the so-called \"strong-\nform\" of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, see Fama (6).\nThe approach used in the studies is as follows. Fund performance has to be\njudged in terms of a standard or benchmark. The standard developed by Jensen\n(12), outlined below, is based on the Sharpe-Lintner Capital Asset Pricing Model\n(CAPM) of market equilibrium. The CAPM provides a measure of the equilibrium\nexpected returns on portfolio j in period t (where the period is very small), and\nthis is the norm against which performance isjudged. Important assumptions\nunderlying this approach include :\n(a) For the CAPM to provide a meaningful benchmark it is necessary that\n(i) the securities markets are dominated by investors who are averse\nto risk and that (ii) the coefficient |3 is a valid measure of risk. In order\nto test (ii), (i) is assumed to be true; see Jensen (12, p.220).\n(b) The process generating security retums is stationary and all investors\nare assumed to agree upon it; hence \"superior information\" is limited\nhere to private knowledge about particular realisations of this stochastic\nprocess (12, pp. 187,212).\nIn order to employ in practice the Jensen benchmark it is necessary to substitute\nrealisations for the market's beliefs. It is here that point (b) is of crucial\nimportance : the generating processing underlying returns is assumed to be\nstable over time, such that realisations can be treated as sample observations of\nthe ex ante joint distribution of returns.\nJensen's study has served as the model for most subsequent work. It concludes\nthat funds' average returns were below what would have been obtained from\ninvestment in naive portfolios with the same systematic risks. Studies by Friend,\nBlume, Crockett (10), Williamson (24) and McDonald (15) in the US more or\nless confirm Jensen's results; these results have been replicated in a recent UK\nstudy by Firth (9).^\n3 74 K. V. Peasnell, L. CL. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\nThe importance of the conclusion of the studies of mutual fund performance\nis now widely recognised in the US securities industry. One consequence of\nthe research has been the proposal of the \"index fund\" which is designed\" to\ndo no more than match the performance of the widely based indices of stock\nmarket performance by pursuing a passive buy\/hold investment policy and\nminimising expenses\" (11, p.5); index fund managers are not expected to pick\n\"winners\". This proposal has been picked up in the UK by Investment\nResearch of Cambridge who are now providing an index-matching service\n(11,P.17).\nA recent paper by Roll (20) casts strong doubt on the generally accepted\neconomic interpretation of the mutual fund studies by Jensen and others\nwhich form the basis of these far-reaching proposals. Roll (p.132) claims:\n\"If the 'market' proxy used in the calculation [of mutual fund\nperformance] is exactly (not significantly different from) ex-post\nefficient, all of the individual Jensen performance measures gross\nof expenses will be identically (not significantly differently from)\nzero. They can be (significantly) non-zero only if the proxy market\nportfolio is (significantly) not efficient. But if the proxy market\nportfolio is not efficient, what is the justification for using it as\na benchmark in performance evaluation?\"\nThis claim by Roll follows directly from the main thesis of his three-part article\n(for the complete paper, see 19^) which is to demonstrate that the testing\nof the CAPM is difficult and currently infeasibie : \"The two-parameter asset\npricing theory is testable in principle; but arguments are given here that :\n(a) No correct and unambiguous test of the theory has appeared in the literature,\nand (b) there is practically no possibility that such a test can be accomplished\nin the future\" (20, pp. 129-130).\nPrior to Roll, the CAPM was accepted to be a positive scientific theory of share\npricing which fitted the facts extraordinarily well. To be sure, empirical research\nshows that the Sharpe Lintner model in its most elementary form does not provide\nan adequate description of the structure of security returns (13, p.391). However,\ntheoretical work by Black (1) showed that the Sharpe-Lintner model is but a\nspecial case of the Zero Beta formulation of the CAPM which is thought by many\nto account for the empirical discrepancy. This Zero Beta CAPM seemed to\nprovide a positive theory of equilibrium security pricing which would yield\nempirical estimates which could serve as benchmarks for assessing fund performance.\nThe benchmark is interpreted as the minimum average retum required by investors\nfor a specified level of risk. Roll, though, claims to have destroyed the case for\nusing the CAPM as such a benchmark.\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 375\nRoll's principal result (Corollary 6 to Theorem 1) is that the mean return on any\nsecurity i, 7i, can be expressed as an exact linear function of the mean retum on\nany portfolio p on the efficient frontier, rp^ viz:\nTi = aoi + au fp (1)\n(N.B.: A portfolio on the efficient frontier must have the following property :\nno portfolio with the same expected one period return has a lower variance of\nreturn). Furthermore, he proves that for every efficient portfolio p there exists\n(in any non-trivial situation) a unique portfolio z ; it is unique in the sense\nthat (a) its return is uncorrelated with the return on p and (b) of the set of\nsuch zero-correlation portfolios, portfolio z has the smallest variance. Using\nthis relationship Roll proves that\naoi = rz ( l - f t ) (2)\nand that\nwhere (3; = cov (r,, r^) \/ var (r-) is the regression slope coefficient of returns\nof security i on those of the efficient portfolio p, and 7z is the mean return\non portfolio z.\nIt is crucial to note that equations (1), (2) and (3), taken together, imply that:\n(i) the linear relationship posited by Black's Zero Beta CAPM holds exactly\nfor every efficient portfolio p ;\n(ii) this linear relationship holds j\/fl\u00abdon\/yi\/portfolio p is efficient or,\nto put it differently, the relationship is a consequence of p's efficiency.\nFrom this it must necessarily follow that the Zero Beta CAPM can hold if and\nonly if the market portfolio is efficient. In operational terms, a Zero Beta CAPM\nwill be found to hold exactly\" (approximately) if and only if the proxy for the\nreturn on the market portfolio is exactly (nearly) efficient. This is so even if the\nvalue-weighted market portfolio is not even remotely efficient.\nResults (i) and (ii) have been proved independently by Fama (7). The essential\npoint is that it is now known the CAPM can be deduced from a single assumption,\nviz. that the market portfolio or proxy thereof is efficient. Ross (21) also should\nbe credited with the independent discovery of this important result. Roll's\ncontribution is in drawing out the full implications of this result.\n376 K. V. Peasnell, L.CL.Skerratt and PA. Taylor\nThe implication of the above analysis for Jensen's methodology is potentially\ndevastating. If the value-weighted market portfolio is efficient ex post, and\nif H = rf,' then Jensen's fund performance measure a.-, can only be non-zero\nwhen the market proxy is not efficient. Roll (20, p. 132) queries: \"But if\nthe proxy market portfolio is not efficient, what is the justification for using it\nas a benchmark in performance evaluation?\" However it is possible to obtain a\nnon-zero OL:^ven when the market proxy is efficient. Roll (19, p. 87) shows\nthat when x-^ \u00a5= rf, then the effect on a; of Jensen's assuming the contrary\nwill be : ^\nttj = (Fz - rf) ( l - \/3 j ) (4)\nAccepting this line of reasoning, and if, following Black (1), it is assumed that\nz^ > H, then\naj > 0 if and only if j^ < 1 (i.e. fund j is of below-average riskiness),\n= 0 if and only if |3j = 1 (j is invested in shares of average riskiness),\n< 0 if and only if j^ > 1 (j is of above-average riskiness).\nThus observed fund performance is dependent on the systematic risk of the\nfund's portfolio -which is completely contrary to Jensen's intentions.\nOj is an exact negative linear function of j3j. Conversely, if 7^  < rf then\nthe above inequalities would be reversed; aj would be an exact positive linear\nfunction of \/3j, which is equally undesirable. It is interesting, in this context, to\nnote that Jensen found that fund performance is negatively correlated with beta -\nwhich he puts down to much of the variability in estimates of performance being\n\"due to random factors or sampling error in the estimates of |3j\" (12, p.225),\nwhereas the above analysis suggests a quite different and much more worrying\npossibility.\nWhether or not this criticism is a fatal one is, in the final analysis, an empirical\nissue. As already noted, what evidence there is suggests that the difference\nTz - H is not insignificant.* Note though that when \/3j is close to unity, then\nthe consequential error is trivial; see equation (4). In the UK, fund betas rarely\nsubstantially depart from unity; see Firth (9).'' In the US, on the other hand, there\nare more outliers (12, Table 5; 16, Table 3). Consequently, US findings might\nbe quite suspect in this respect.\nAlthough this problem is clearly of some importance, the difficulties encountered\nby relaxing the assumption that the proxy for the market portfolio is efficient\nare more fundamental. After all, relaxing the assumption about the location of\nthe z portfolio merely allows aj to be non-zero (admittedly in a misleading\nfashion); relaxing the assumption of the market's efficiency kicks away the very\nfoundations of the Jensen methodology, as can be seen as follows.\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 3 77\nThe CAPM is an equilibrium theory and only makes sense if it is assumed that\nthe market is efficient. The situation can be summarised in terms of the following\nparadox. If the market is efficient then the only way in which a fund can appear\nto earn excess (risk adjusted) returns is by comparing its performance with a\nstandard based on an inefficient proxy for the market. What is the justification\nthough for such a benchmark? On the other hand, if the market is not efficient\nthen the CAPM does not hold and the test procedure is apparently meaningless.\nIn order to see this more clearly consider Diagram I. For simplicity, assume\nFz = rf and that rf is less than the mean retum on the global minimum variance\nportfolio. Let portfolio M be the inefficient market portfolio (or its inefficient\nproxy) used for evaluating fund performance, and let P be an efficient\nportfolio with r^  = rf such that Tp = r^j. It foUows that a^ > al by the\nDIAGRAM I\nPORTFOLIOS IN MEAN VARIANCE SPACE\n-efficient\nfrontier\nM\ndefinition of efficiency. As P is efficient r; can be expressed as an exact linear\nfunction of \/3jp (the estimated beta of fund j with P),\n7j = rf + (fp - rf) PjP (5)\nIdentity (5) can be rewritten as*\nrj ^ rf + (7M - rf) \/3JM + (rM - rf)(\/3jp -f)jM ) (6)\n378 K. V. Peasnell, L.C.L. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\nNote that if ap = a^, then M must be the efficient portfolio P; in which case\nj must have the same beta with both and the last term in (6) vanishes, (6) reducing\nto (5). On the other hand, when M is inefficient (as assumed) then the third term\nis highly unlikely to vanish.'\nUsing (6) yields excess performance of\n- PJM) (7)\nNotice that (7) is the general case of Roll's special result that when M is the\nefficient portfolio P then a. is exactly zero.'\u00b0 Unfortunately, nothing really\nuseful can be inferred from the converse situation when aj =\/= 0; the sign and\nmagnitude of 03jp - \/Jj^) does not tell us anything about the extent of M's\ninefficiency : betas of j with different \"market\" portfolios (one of which is\nefficient) can be of considerably different magnitudes (cf. footnote 9). Put\ndifferently, it is impossible to predict the sign or magnitude of (\/3jp - J3JM)\nwithout detailed knowledge of the composition of M and P, even if we are\ntold that M is highly or minimally inefficient.\nIt would seem that if the market proxy used to calculate betas is inefficient then\nthe fund performance measure Oj will be nonzero. Unfortunately nothing can\nbe inferred about the fund's performance from the sign or magnitude of the fund\nperformance measure. What Roll has established is that the theoretical form of\nthe CAPM must hold exactly if the market portfolio is efficient, thereby ruling\nout the possibility of abnormal gains and losses. Conversely, identity (6)\ndemonstrates that a regression of the returns on a security (or fund) on the returns\non a market portfolio will depart from the theoretical model if the market\nportfolio is inefficient, resulting in possibly nonzero performance measures of the\nform of (7) which are functions of beta. Roll shows that when the market\nportfolio (or proxy thereof) is inefficient then such regression lines will not be\nlinear functions of beta.\nDoes this mean that reliance on Jensen's CAPM-based benchmark when\nevaluating fund performance is misguided, as Roll implies? The answer would\nseem to be that it is. But it has to be acknowledged that it may be just as\nmisleading to attempt to evaluate fund performance without first specifying a\nmodel of some kind of the security pricing process, as some studies do. For\nexample, Cranshaw (4) makes a straight comparison of the performance of UK\nunit trusts with that of the market as a whole for the period 1963-1969, without\nadjusting for risk differences;'' he concludes that the trusts did no better than\nthe market index. He remarks (4, p. 467):\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 3 79\n\"It is a conclusion difficult to reconcile with a belief in differences in\nmanagement, because it would imply that for each good manager there\nwas one actively bad manager, that is, one who consistently managed\nhis portfolio worse than an unmanaged portfolio. This is a curious skill\nto be possessedby a large number of our investment managers\".\nTo see that this is a somewhat premature judgement, let us for argument's sake\nassume that we know that investors in general behave according to the dictates\nof the CAPM, i.e. that most investors' decisions are based on the two parameters\nof mean and variance of portfolio returns such that their portfolios are chosen\nin order to promise the combination of mean returns and beta optimal to the\nindividual. Let us further assume that realisations are generally in accordance\nwith expectations, i.e. that ex post and ex ante retum distributions are identical.\nNow, Firth (9, pp. 170-176) reports in his appendix estimated betas for over\n300 UK trusts, not one of which was greater than unity.' ' Given our above\nassumptions about the applicability of the CAPM,' ^  it would seem clear that\nthe equilibrium mean returns for all these trusts should be less than the mean\nretum on the market. In short, Cranshaw's test does not allow for risk differences;\naccording to theory, the funds should report lower average retums than the\nmarket.\nThe dilemma is obvious. If it is desired to measure fund performance such that\nall factors influencing performance other than skill and availability of\ninformation are held constant, then a model of the investment process is needed.\nWithout such a model, we cannot say how much of Cranshaw's results are due\nto attempts to minimise or maximise risk. (CAPM's apparent capacity to handle\nthis was its basic attraction to empirical researchers in the first place.) We thus\nseem to be back at square one. The CAPM - or something like it - is needed to\ncontrol for confounding factors. But, as Roll points out, if the CAPM fits ex post\nthen superior or inferior fund performance is impossible, and if it does not fit\nthen the tests are without support fom economic theory.\nIII. AN ARBITRAGE APPROACH TO MEASURING INVESTMENT\nPERFORMANCE\nThe only way of escaping this dilemma is to abandon the CAPM along with its\nbaggage of mean-variance theory and its attendant efficient frontiers. Whatever\nalternative approach is adopted, a benchmark must be found which (a) is\ncomputable from observable variables and (b) can be interpreted in the context\nof a recognisable investment strategy. CAPM certainly satisfies both of these\nrequirements; see Ohlson (17). One attraction of using CAPM as the benchmark\nis that it offers a method of computing risk adjusted required retums such that the\n(positive or negative) excess returns can be interpreted as pure economic\nquasi-rentals, i.e. arbitrage profits (something for nothing). If at all possible, it is\n380 K. V. Peasnell, L.C.L. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\ndesirable to retain this arbitrage feature of the CAPM benchmark; the strength\nof our approach set out below is that it is entirely based on arbitrage.\nThe economic logic of arbitrage can be illustrated by the following example.\nAssume that an investor knows that the return on fund j will exceed the return\non investments in the same risk class; in which case he can \"earn\" excess retums\nwithout committing any of his own funds. He will achieve this by selling short\nother securities in j's risk class and using the proceeds to purchase shares in j .\nSubsequently he will sell the shares in j to cover the short position. If his\nprivate information about j is correct, he will obtain an abnormal return.\nConversely, if the investor had known that j would earn inferior retums, he\nwould have adopted the reverse strategy, i.e. gone short in j and long in the other\nsecurities.\nAs noted above, the CAPM methodology can be viewed in arbitrage terms.\nInterestingly, we can interpret the CAPM parameters as investment weights. The\nexpected retum of fund j can be rearranged as\nrj = ( l - \/ 5 j M ) r f + \/3jM ^M (9)\nA retum of the same risk class as j can be obtained by investing in f and M\nin the proportions ( l -^ j^ ) and ^ j ^ . In arbitrage terms, this would mean going\nshort in f and M in these proportions and using the proceeds to go long in j .\nAs the CAPM holds only when M is efficient this must imply zero gains to\narbitrage.'*\nThe arbitrage approach, of course, does not depend on the existence of the\nCAPM. If the investor has \"certain\" (private) faiowledge that the fund will do\nbetter (or worse) than average then he should be able to develop a \"hedge\"\nwhereby he goes long (short) in the fund and short (long) in other assets in such\na manner that his own wealth commitment is zero. When an arbitrager \"knows\"\nof a superior (inferior) profit opportunity and invests without committing any\nof his own wealth, then there is no risk. In practice, of course, arbitrage operations\nare risky because : (a) arbitragers cannot be sure that the information about r:\nupon which they are acting is both private and certain; (b) it is impossible to be\nsure that one's knowledge of the multivariate generating process is reliable. To the\nextent that futures markets are incomplete, thereby inhibiting short selling, the\npossibility and extent of arbitrage is reduced. However the risks of and restrictions\non arbitrage operations, although very real, are not relevant for the purpose of\nevaluating fund performance. It is not to be supposed that investors will necessarily\nuse (or get) private information about superior\/inferior fund performance to make\narbitrage gains; the above difficulties may be of sufficient magnitude to discourage\nthem. The purpose of evaluating fund performance is to isolate the information\naspect from risk and other considerations.\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 381\nBriefly consider, in formal terms, the investment manouvres underlying the\nproposed notional arbitrage logic. Let X: denote the amount of resources\n(available to the arbitrager) invested in j such that it can be \"covered\" by short or\nlong positions in N\u20141 other assets :\nN\nXj = 2 X; (10)\nN must be sufficiently large to average out random fluctuations in j's return;\nRoss (22, p. 197) points out that it is necessary to hold a well-diversified\nportfolio in order to eliminate \"noise\". Also, the hedge must be such as to\nehminate any systematic elements in security retums.\nThe arbitrage profit or loss from going long in j is\n_ N\nDj = Xjrj - 2 Xi rj (11)\nA difficulty immediately presents itself: it is not possible to ascertain how much\nof the profit Dj > 0 is due to the superior performance of j and how much\nis due to the inferior performances of some of the shorted investments. There is\ndifficulty in allocating Dj over the long position and the short portfolio. What\nis needed is an arbitrage strategy which involves shorting an investment called the\n\"market\" in order to be able to interpret the results as the extent to which fund\nj outperforms the market in general. As it is necessary to hold a well-diversified\nportfslio it might be possible to treat the second term on the RHS of (11) as the\nshort position in assets including the market portfolio.\nIt is now possible to provide an arbitrage rationale for Jensen's Oj measure. The\narbitrage strategy can be viewed from more or less the same position as the CAPM\nbut without being burdened by the CAPM's mean-variance equilibrium restrictions.\nThe RHS of (10) can be reduced to a portfolio of two assets, the riskless asset f\nand the market portfolio M, such that\n(10a)\n(f is included in order to complete the hedge. Any portfolio uncorrelated with\nM would serve the same purpose.) In which case, by (11), the arbitrage profit is\nRescaling by Xj gives\n382 K. V. Peasnell, L.C.L. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\nDj\/xj = Tj - (Xf\/Xj)rf - (xM\/xj)rM (l ib)\nwhich can be written more simply as\nwhere\nThe problem reduces to the choice of W[^ j .\nIt is known that a significant proportion of the variation in security' ^ returns is\naccounted for by economy-wide factors. Hence we can write j's return in terms\nof the following model' *\nrj = aj + bjr^i + ej (12)\nor, in terms of means,\nrj = aj + bj 7M (13)\nIn order to eliminate the systematic element bj r^, we must set Wj^  = bj .\nSubstituting (13) into ( l ie) gives\na=j = aj + bj 7M - (1-bj) rf - bj 7M\n= aj - ( l-bj)rf (14)\nThis result depends on equation (12) being an adequate representation of the\npattern of realised security returns. For arbitrage purposes it is necessary that ej\ncan be diversified away; this requires that the ej's be sufficiently independent\nacross securities to allow the law of large numbers to hold, see Ross (23). (The\nSharpe diagonal model more than meets this requirement in that the off-diagonal\nelements in the variance-covariance matrix are zero; this is a stronger assumption\nthan is required.' ^) It is interesting to see what happens if the Sharpe-Lintner\nCAPMholds, i.e. when r^  = rf and M is efficient. In this case bj is the beta\nof j with M and aj = (1\u2014bj)rf, thereby ensuring that aj = 0 (as efficient\nset mathematics demands). However, it is important to recognise that the arbitrage\napproach is not dependent on the CAPM holding; hence excess returns are\npossible.\nThe arbitrage approach does not avoid the problems involved in the (limiting)\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 383\ncase where the CAPM holds in its zero-beta form. As given in equation (4), fund\nperformance is equal to the excess of r^  over rf times the proportion of shorts\nheld in the riskless asset, whereas it should be identically zero. Following Roll's\ncritique, there is no practicable way to ascertain empirically which of the two\nversions of CAPM is to be preferred. However, we have already pointed out in\nsection II that in the case of UK fund performance the impact is likely to be\nsmall, particularly in comparison to the effects of relaxing the assumption of\nthe efficiency of the market portfolio. In addition, there are other reasons for\nbelievingjhat the biasing effect is not likely to be large. In terms of the CAPM\ntheory, r^  should be substituted for rf when there are (absolute) restrictions\non going short in the riskless asset, i.e. on borrowing. Jensen (13, p.377) points\nout that whilst in times of inflation it is strictly true that a riskless asset is not\navailable, the error made by assuming that there is a riskless asset is likely to be\nvery small. In the empirical studies, average returns are calculated as the mean of\nlogarithms of proportionate changes (i.e. average return is the logarithm of the\ngeometric mean return over the sample observations) thus implying that holding\nof an investment is over an infinitesimally small interval - in which case,\nuncertainty introduced by inflation will be very minor. Thus we can usefully\ntreat the riskless asset as synonymous with the zero-beta portfolio.\nMore important, even if it were strictly true that the riskless asset could not in\npractice be shorted, it does not really matter when assessing fund performance.\nAll that our arbitrage approach shows is the returns to be made if shorting were\npossible, whereas a CAPM rationale for a; places much emphasis on the identific-\nation of a model of security pricing. All tliat the arbitrage approach depends on\nis the identification of the systematic element in security retums. It should be\nrecalled that if the zero-beta CAPM holds, resulting in excess returns of\naj = (r^ \u2014 r f ) ( l -P j ) , then all that our measure states is that abnormal gains\/\nlosses are possible if the the riskless asset f can be shorted. However such\ngains\/losses can be made on all quoted securities, not just fund j . An appropriate\ncheck would be to compare the a of j with that of a \"control\" security i with\nthe same beta. If aj > a i then we can say that fund j's performance is superior.\nIndeed, the arbitrage approach can be used to incorporate any number of\n(linearly independent, i.e. orthogonal) systematic elements in security retums.\nThere is evidence to suggest that there are a number of systematic elements;\nKing (14), for example, has shown historically that whilst market-wide movements\naccounted for the largest proportion of variation in New York Stock Exchange\nsecurity returns, industry and other factors together were nearly as important.\nThis result is not consistent with the diagonal model, but is consistent with an\nexpanded model of the form\nrj = aj + bj, rM + bj, ri + ej (15)\n384 K. V. Peasnell, L.CL. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\nwhere rj^ ^ is the market-wide factor and rj is the industry-specific factor in which\nfund j is heavily invested. (If fund j invests heavily in more than one industry,\nthen more than one factor would be appropriate.) Taking means, equation (15)\nbecomes\n(16)\nAs before, the investment in j is financed by short and long positions - in this\ncase, in f, M and I :\nXj = Xf + XM + Xj (17)\nRescaling, we get\nXM\/XJ = WM ,\nXj\/Xj = Wj ,\nXf\/Xj = 1 - W M - wp\nIn which case X; is given as :\nOj = Fj - (1 -WM-Wi)rf - W ^ F M - wi 7i (18)\nSetting\nand\nthen (18) can be rearranged as\nOj = aj - ( 1 - b j , - bj3)rf (19)\nAs with equation (14), excess performance is defmed as the firm specific factor\nminus a proportion of the return on the riskless asset.' * It is important to\nappreciate the nature of equations (12) and (15). In both cases, the firm-specific\nelement in r: is aj+ej ; bj, rj in (15) is that part of the firm-specific element\nin (12) which it has in common with other firms invested in the same industry.\nIn other words, equation (12) decomposes rj into two elements, whereas equation\n(15) further decomposes it into three elements.\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 385\nThe key issue is the identification of the market-wide and industry-wide factors.\nOne approach would be to regress security returns on proxies for the market\nand industry factors; the difficulty with this though is that results are sensitive\nto the choice of proxies. On the other hand, the approach used by King employs\nfactor-analytic tecliniques to identify the hidden systematic elements. The\nregression approach, in effect, imposes a model on the data, i.e. the factors are\npredetermined. On the other hand, factor analysis is a data-search technique\nwhich identifies the factors; it is a sample-specific method and is not concerned\nwith the underlying generating process.\nThe role of the CAPM in the arbitrage approach to evaluating fund performance\nis clearly coincidental - more accurately, a CAPM-based approach gives the\nsame results in the single-factor case. Where there is more than one systematic\nelement (factor) in security returns the CAPM is misleading : notional\narbitrage profits will not be riskless since non-market systematic elements will\nnot have been hedged away. It is worth noting in this context that the existence\nof more than one important factor is itself evidence against the CAPM. The\nCAPM predicts, in effect, that there is only one systematic element in the returns,\nthe general market factor. To the extent that there is known to be industry and\nother systematic effects on security returns, the CAPM does not fit the facts.\nAnd to the extent that the CAPM does not fit the facts, the CAPM is an imperfect\narbitrage model for adjusting for risk. Roll's view on the untestability of the CAPM\nnotwithstanding, findings such as King's are evidence against the CAPM in that\na proxy for the market is not required (a market portfolio is not required).\nConversely, Ross (21) shows that the efficiency of the market requires one-factor\nlinearity. A word of caution : the factor-analytic studies are based on subsets of\nsecurities, not on the complete set, and therefore one cannot be certain that the\nresults would hold for all securities. Intuitively though, it would be difficult to\nenvisage the finding of strong industry effects in randomly selected subsamples\nwhen there is only one factor in the complete data set.\nThere are also difficulties concerning the plausibility of the CAPM. The foundations\nof the CAPM are to be found in portfolio theory, where it is assumed that the\nmean and the variance of portfolio returns are sufficient statistics. For\nmean-variance analysis to make economic sense either of two conditions must\nhold : 0) the distribution of returns can be completely specified by two or less\nindependent parameters and utility functions are concave (risk aversion over\nthe entire range of outcomes); or (ii) utility functions can be approximated by\na quadratic which is monotonic non-decreasing over the entire range of outcomes.\nWhether these strong assumptions do grave injustice to the facts is far from clear\n- what is clear is that they are strong enough to cause us to think again about\nthe appropriateness of assessing fund performance in terms of mean-variance\nportfolio theory. Given Roll's demonstration of the untestability of the CAPM,\nand also given the restrictiveness of its assumptions (which include i and ii above)\n386 K. V. Peasnell, LC.L. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\nit is unwise to assess fund perfonnance in terms of the CAPM without further\ninquiry into the appropriateness of the CAPM as a vehicle for adjusting for risk.\nThe arbitrage approach outlined in this section avoids all these difficulties.\nFurthermore, CAPM-based tests can be viewed as special cases of the arbitrage\napproach, appropriate when industry and other systematic effects (excluding the\ngeneral market effects) are deemed to be of trivial magnitude. The arbitrage\napproach therefore offers a means of rescuing an extensive body of empirical\nresearch from the dustbin, the place to which Roll's results seemed to have\nconsigned it.\nIV. MEASUREMENT OF SYSTEMATIC ELEMENT(S)\nAnother difficulty with the CAPM-based tests concerns the way in which it is\nsupposed that funds create excess returns. In Section II we pointed out an\nassumption underlying Jensen's tests, viz. that the generating process is\nstationary over time and that the CAPM describes this process exactly. Hence,\nas Jensen notes, superior and inferior fund performances are random disturbances\naround the expected value and thus \"superior information\" can only be with\nrespect to particular realisations of the process. Therefore if a fund follows a\nbuy-and-hold policy then superior returns must eventually be averaged out with\ninferior returns. The only way to avoid this is for the fund to make at least one\nswitch; in which case the laws of large numbers need not apply. This might\nlead, though, to a fund's beta changing through time, contrary to Jensen's\nassumption. If so, the fund's risk will not have been held constant.\nIn order to see this more clearly, let us assume (a) that the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM\nfits \"in the long run\" and (b) that a \"sufficient\" number of observations have\nbeen taken to obtain reliable estimates of the parameter values of the process.\nThis means that market portfoUo M isefficient. Assume, first, that fund j\nadopts a buy-and-hold investment strategy over the investigation interval. The\nfund's mean return over the period can be written as:\n?j = ( l - P j ) r f + |3J7M (20)\n= ( l -WM)rf + WM7M (21)\nwhere w^ can be interpreted as fund j's proportionate \"equivalent investment\"\nin M. ' ' W[^ j is a fixed weight over the holding period. In these circumstances\na: is constrained to be zero. In order to obtain a positive excess return, the fund\nmust vary the weigh! w^. For example, assume that the fund \"knows\" at the\nbeginning of the period that the market return will be temporarily depressed for\npart of the period, such that the average return during say the first half of the\nperiod will be below the (fixed) return on the riskless asset. Logically, the fund\nshould invest heavily^\" during the first half of the period in the riskless asset; at the\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 387\nend of this interval the fund should sell part or all of these fixed-return securities\nand reinvest the proceeds in the market portfolio, in order to take advantage of\nthe rise which is expected to occur in the market. Notice though that as the\nmarket portfolio M is efficient over the holding period, equation (21) must hold.\nHowever we can no longer interpret the observed beta, \/3j in equation (20), as the\nproportion of j 's resources invested in M during the period; the portfolio weights\nchange. Similarly, j's beta changes during the period; |3j is just the average beta.\nRegardless of these problems of interpretation, efficient set mathematics ensures\nthat equation (20) must hold; hence aj = 0.\nAt first sight, this result seems contrary to commonsense, even paradoxical. If the\nfund manager \"knows\" when the market is going to fall and rise, and he acts on\nthis knowledge, then surely he must make an abnormal gain? The answer, of course,\nis that (20) assumes away the very possibility of abnormal returns : if the market\nportfolio M is efficient ex post, then there is no way of \"beating the market\". The\ntrouble is that fund j is itself part of this universe of securities whose average returns\nare defined by equation (20) and as such offers only an equilibrium return. For the\nfund j to beat the market, j must be outside the universe of securities assumed\nefficient. To assume that j is part of the set of securities deemed to be in equilibrium\n(such that M is on the frontier) is to eliminate the possibility of j being out of\nequilibrium.\nAssume therefore that all the mutual funds whose investment skills are being\ninvestigated are excluded from the universe of securities comprising the \"market\".\n(By market we mean the quoted securities of industrial and commercial companies.)\nThis is not an unrealistic assumption : open-ended mutual funds in the US and unit\ntrusts in the UK are not quoted in the stock market: the returns on funds used in\nthe empirical studies are calculated from data concerning their portfolios. This is not\nso with closed-end mutual funds and investment companies; these funds have quoted\nmarket prices for their own shares. If, in accordance with CAPM, the value-weighted\nportfolio of quoted securities is on the efficient frontier (of the set of quoted\nsecurities) it is then just conceivable that, by switching, the funds could earn excess\nreturns. But how are we to interpret these excess returns (assuming they arise)?\nLet us continue to concentrate on fund j which, it will be recalled, invested all\nits resources in the riskless asset f and then switched all these resources to M for\nthe remainder of the holding period. A number, aj, can be found such that\nFj = (1 - aj) rf + aj 7M (22)\nas long as rf f rj^ j (which is so, given that M is on the positive-sloping part of the\nefficient frontier). It needs to be emphasized that a; cannot be interpreted as an\ninvestment weight, for the reasons given above; there are difficulties interpreting it\nas |3j, given that now j is not part of the universe of securities comprising the market.\n388 K. V. Peasnell, L.C.L. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\nIt is of course true that a slope coefficient could be obtained from a time series\nregression, but it is not possible to interpret this as the beta of CAPM theory. By\nswitching investments the fund might be changing its risk (certainly so in the example\ngiven above) and it is difficult to see how the investigator can aggregate betas over\ndifferent time periods; conversely, there are (apparently insoluble) problems in\ndisaggregating an estimate of \"average\" risk. See Roll (19, p.88).\nThe arbitrage approach avoids these difficulties for the following reasons:\n(a) It is not assumed that the market is in long-run equilibrium; hence it is possible\nfor funds with information of the kind in the above example to earn excess\nreturns.\n(b) There are no special difficulties with changing risk consequent upon switching.\nThe notional arbitrage operation is riskless, because the arbitrage investment\nweights are determined with the benefit of hindsight.\nPoint (b) needs amplification. In the CAPM, each time the fund changes its invest-\nments, there may be a change in beta. Consequently it is necessary to estimate j's\nbeta over these different intervals and somehow average them, whereas with the\narbitrage approach, how the fund's returns came about is of no consequence; all the\nresearcher has to do is to estimate the systematic components and use these to\ncreate a notional hedge.\nA further virtue of the arbitrage approach is that it avoids the need to determine\nfrom sample data the nature of the underlying generating process. All that is\nrequired is to calculate ex post, from a given set of data, the systematic elements\nin all security prices. The most appropriate technique for this is factor analysis.\nIn the remainder of this section, we shall consider a potential source of error in\ninterpreting Jensen's study from an arbitrage viewpoint, a source stemming from the\ndesire understandable from a CAPM perspective to get accurate estimates of\npopulation betas.\nFor expositional purposes, assume that the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM holds \"in the long\nrun\". Roll's critique of Jensen's methodology, discussed in Section II above, assumes\nimplicitly that the sample data used for estimating betas are the same as those used\nfor calculating excess performances. Empirical studies, though, have often used\ndifferent data sets to estimate betas. For where a reliable estimate is sought of the\nunderlying population betas then it would seem natural to use all the data available\nto estimate betas. Thus in Jensen's study \"the risk coefficient is estimated from all\ndata available on each fund [i.e. not only the data for the period 1955-64 used to\nevaluate fund performance but as far back as the data go] in order to minimise the\nsampling error in the estimates\" (12, p.217). We shall show, though, that from an\narbitrage viewpoint, using additional data could result in misleading estimates of fund\nperformance, in theory at least. Whether the error is a substantial one in practice is\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 389\nan empirical issue to which we shall also address ourselves.\nJensen's use of prior data is legitimised, from a CAPM standpoint, by the evidence he\nprovides supporting the hypothesis that betas are stable through time. However,\nwhether or not betas are stable is a matter of some controversy at the present time\nof writing. On the one hand, Brenner and Smidt (3) and Fabozzi and Francis (5) have\nfound that betas in different periods could have been drawn from the same samples;\nBlume (2), on the other hand, argues that estimated betas tend to regress toward\nthe grand mean, suggesting nonstationarity. Cranshaw's (4) findings suggest that the\nevidence concerning UK unit trust betas is consistent with the hypothesis that they\nare all drawn from the same population! More research on this issue is clearly needed.\nLater in this section we demonstrate that, from an arbitrage perspective, it is import-\nant that sample estimates be (more or less) constant over time. It is not clear\nwhether all studies of mutual fund performance utilising prior information meet this\nrequirement. For example, Jensen's Table 5 (12, p.218) shows that individual fund\nbetas for the period 1955-64 often differ from those for 1945-64, even though they\nappear to be drawn from the same set of distributions.\nFirst let us consider the problem from a theoretical perspective. Consider the follow-\ning partitioned matrix of hypothetical security retums data. (Note: we are contin-\nuing to deal entirely with realisations; the matrix of returns below is to be viewed as\nobserved ex post returns, not expectations.)\n''22 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 r2B r2,B+l '\"2,B+2 ' \u2022 ' ''2,B+T\n\u2022\u2022N2 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \"\"NB rN,B+l''N,B+2.\n(23)\nEach row of the matrix gives the observations available on a given security (there\nbeing N securities) and each column shows the security returns for a given period\n(there being B+T periods). In the empirical studies, the ^is could be computed in a\nvariety of ways including (a) over an initial estimation interval of B periods or (b)\nover the entire observation interval E = B+T or (c) over the test interval T . The\n\/JjS thus computed are then used to construct the hedge for the test interval T .\nTo make this clearer, consider the procedure (b) where \/3jS are computed from\nreturns of the entire interval E . We shall write this ^j as ^j , the superscript E\nindicating that the beta is obtained from the pre-test and test data.\nIn Diagram II \"E-space frontier\" is a short-hand reference to the efficient frontier\ncalculated from the whole NxE observations shown in the data matrix; likewise,\n390 K.V.

The same is equally true for T-space, as can be seen from Diagram\nIllb with intercept and slope of rJ and (iJ. - rj) ; all the mean retums on the N\nsecurities are exactly \"explained' by the SML line. But the slope and intercepts of\nthe two SML lines can be significantly different in the two spaces, despite the\nmarket portfoho M being efficient in both sample spaces; this can be seen from\nthe two diagrams. (For consistency with Jensen's analysis, we are assuming that in\nboth spaces the riskless security is the appropriate orthogonal portfolio).\nWe can now see the impact on Jensen's performance index a; of measuring beta\nin E-space and applying it to T-space . The performance measure is\n(24)\nIn effect, the long-run expected return for j , rj , has been updated to incorporate\nthe realised retums on f and M ; the revised return is then deducted from the\nrealised retum on j in T-space , {J . Substituting in (24) for ^ yields\n\u00abj = (^ M - 'I) (^j\"- ^P (25)\nFor large T , we would expect economic forces to ensure that r j < r~ .^ Hence\nthe sign of Oj depends on the relative magnitudes of the betas in E-space and\nT-space . If beta is exactly (approximately) constant over the two intervals, then\nby (25) aj will be exactly (approximately) zero. On the other hand, funds with\ndecreasing sample systematic risk, i.e. with Pj < |3? will appear as inferior\nperformers, with aj < 0; conversely,funds with increasing risk will appear to\noutperform the market.\nJensen calculated betas from observations in what we have here called E-space, the\nperiod 1945-64, in those instances where the funds had been in existence that long;\notherwise he used observations in T-space, 1955-64, and as far back in B-space as\npossible. However CAPM tests of fund performance may be interpreted from an\narbitrage viewpoint only if the betas are calculated from observations in T-space.\nIn order to estimate the error caused by using prior observations, a part of Jensen's\nstudy has been reworked, from data given in his paper. The results are given below.\nColumns (i) and (ii) of Table 1 report, for those 56 funds (out of 115) which were\nin existence over the whole period 1945-64, betas computed by Jensen from both\nE-space and T-space; these were extracted from Jensen's Tables 2 and 5. Our\nTable 1 also gives in column (iii) Jensen's estimates of performance for these funds.\nColumn (iv) reports our estimates of the \"performance bias\" which could have\noccurred assuming that the market was efficient in both E-space and T-space.\nThey are defined as a; in equation (25) and provide an indication of the degree\nof error in Jensen's methodology, error stemming from using extra observations to\n392 K. V. Peasnell, L.C.L. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\ncompute \"more reliable\" beta estimates. Column (v)'shows estimates of fund\nperformances in accordance with our arbitrage rationale, in which betas are\ncalculated from the 1955-64 T-space observations alone. The calculations in\ncolumns (iv) and (v) are based on Jensen's estimates (15, p.222) of rj and r^J\nviz. the ten-year risk free retum is given as ij = log (1 + .03)'\" = .296, and the\nestimated return on the market portfolio as f^ =log(l + .126)'\u00b0 = 1.187. Fund\nretums, defined as logarithms of wealth relatives, are to be found in Jensen's Table\n2.\nThe degree of error from using the wrong beta, the one using data prior to the test\nperiod, is considerable, as can be seen by comparing the elements in columns (iii)\nand (iv) of Table 1. In Jensen's sample, his performance measure (which he labels\n6*) is biased downwards.^' The mean of the excess returns calculated by Jensen\nfor these 56 funds is -0.076, i.e. a negative yield of approximately %% per annum,\nwhereas the mean of the excess returns calculated by us (reported in column (v) is\n-0.051, i.e. a negative yield of W?o per annum.\nIt is interesting to note that Jensen found that 34 out of the 56 funds had 6* < 0\n(negative excess returns); on our corrected basis, a further 5 funds had negative\nexcess returns, despite the fact that on average our aj is larger than Jensen's 6 f.\nThis reworking of Jensen's study in order to assess the funds' performances from\nan arbitrage standpoint, has produced substantially the same results: fund returns\nnet of management expenses and brokerage commissions (but gross of loading\ncharges) do not \"beat the market\" on average. The shortfall, though, is not as great\nas Jensen's study indicates. In general, it seems that although Jensen's methodology\nis theoretically unsatisfactory from an arbitrage viewpoint, in that using betas\nderived from E-space would not secure for an investor the elimination of all the\nsystematic risk in T-space, his results are still generally reliable. Whether or not other\nstudies of fund performance which have similarly used observations outside of\nT-space to calculate betas can also be relied upon remains a subject for further\nresearch.\nIt is interesting to consider a number of additional relationships. As previously noted,\nJensen found that there was a relationship between his fund measure and beta which\nhe attributed to \"noise\" . We have recomputed for the reduced sample the corrected\nR^ between 5* and 13^5^4, and done the same for our a and \/3 , yielding\nR^s of 0.435 and 0.368 respectively (both highly significant at the .01 level). From\nour arbitrage standpoint, there is no reason to require that a fund performance\nmeasure be independent of beta (as there is with the CAPM). It is interesting to note\nthat the extent of the bias is not significantly correlated with beta : the R^ between\nthe bias estimates in column (iv) and the beta estimates in column ( ii ) is -.0.098\nwhich is not significant at the .05 level'.\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Performance 393\nTABLE I\nJENSEN'S ESTIMATES OF FUND PERFORMANCES 1955-64 CORRECTED\nFOR BETA BIAS\nID\nNO.\n140\n141\n142\n145\n147\n1148\n2148\n151\n152\n153\n157\n162\n163\n166\n169\n171\n174\n175\n177\n178\n180\n182\n184\n185\n187\n188\n190\n2191\n195\n198\n200\n201\n205\n215\n216\nFUND NAME\nAberdeen t'und\nAffiliated Fund\nAmerican Business Shares\nAssociated Fund Trust\nAxe-Houghton Fund B\nAxe-Houghton Fund A\nAxe-Houghton Stock Fund\nBoston Fund\nBroad St, Investing\nBullock Fund\nCentury Shares Trust\nChemical Fund\nThe Colonial Fund\nCommonwealth Inv,\nCorporate Leaders\nDelaware Fund\nDiversified Inv.

In the more realistic case where the\nmarket is not automatically assumed to be efficient - hence it is conceivable that\nfunds could beat the market - then the correction is still necessary in order to en-\nsure that the correct notional arbitrage weights are employed. The arbitrage approach\nassumes that the systematic elements in fund returns of a particular test interval\ncan be eliminated. If not, the constructed notional hedge is not riskless. Future\nresearch in this area should analyse more closely the systematic elements in security\nreturns in the chosen test interval (probably by factor analytic methods) than has\nhitherto been done. The arbitrage interpretation of Jensen depends upon (a) there\nbeing only a single factor across security returns, and that (b) this single factor is\nadequately proxied by the chosen market index. Our reworking of Jensen's study\nassumes that the Standard and Poor index adequately represents the assumed\nsingle factor, and this is very unhkely to be the case.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper examines the validity of a widely used method of assessing mutual fund\nperformance. The method owes its popularity to having the virtue of seemingly being\nable to control for the confounding effects of differences in risk (and also for gains\/\nlosses due to general market movements, i.e, for good\/bad luck). Recent theoretical\nresearch by Roll and others suggests that the CAPM is an inappropriate vehicle for\nassessing investment performance. Our study, whilst corroborating and extending\nthis finding, offers a different rationale for the CAPM-based tests, one which owes\nnothing to the CAPM and hence sidesteps Roll's objections. This new rationale is\nbased on a notional arbitrage strategy. Above all else, the proposed arbitrage appro-\nach avoids having to assume that the market portfolio is efficient. Unfortunately\nwhen the market portfolio is efficient then there is no possibility of abnormal\nreturns; the absence of such a condition precludes the use of the CAPM. An arbitrage\napproach avoids this logical difficulty. We have thus turned a full circle. The paper\nstarts by outlining Roll's critique of Jensen's approach to measuring fund perform-\nance. We go on to suggest that the tests are not lacking in economic logic, if re-\ninterpreted in terms of a notional arbitrage strategy. Hopefully, this avoids the need\nto scrap an entire body of research.\nNevertheless, these tests are not without deficiencies. There may be more than one\ncommon factor in security returns; for example, in addition to the general factor\naffecting all securities, industry class may \"explain\" part of the variation in returns.\nThese other factors need to be purged; future research might well employ factor\nanalytic methods to identify these common elements in returns rather than using the\nubiquitous linear regressions. Research is also needed into the extent to which the\nstock market index approximates the general factor obtained by principal compon-\nents analysis.\n396 K.V. Peasnell, L.C.L. Skerratt and P.A. Taylor\nThe CAPM-based tests are only approximations of the kinds of studies which the\narbitrage approach calls for. Hence their reliability is in doubt. One particular source\nof error in Jensen's mutual fund study, viz. the use of prior observations in comput-\ning betas, is investigated in Section FV above. A reworking of Jensen's findings\nindicates that, whilst he has underestimated excess returns by about 30 per cent on\naverage, his conclusion that most funds do not beat the market is correct. Although\nincomplete, this is an example of the kind of corroborative research which is\ncurrently needed. Accordingly, it seems somewhat premature to reject out of hand\nall the past tests of fund performance just because they fall short of the ideal. That\nis to counsel perfection. One must consider the plausibility of alternative views.\nThere are good economic reasons for doubting that most mutual funds can outper-\nform the market. Our reworking of Jensen shows that his results are robust with\nrespect to quite serious measurement errors.\nThis paper has focussed on the measurement of mutual fund performance. However\nthe CAPM-based performance measure has also been used in the assessment of semi-\nstrong efficiency in answering such questions as : Is the stock market capable of\nmaking proper allowance for the effects on published company profits of changes in\nreporting methods? Does the market react to earnings announcements? The arbit-\nrage rationale of the CAPM-based tests of fund performance may serve equally well\nas a partial justification for these other studies. Further research is needed in this\narea.\nNotes\nMutual fund is the American term for what is usually referred to in the UK as a Unit Trust.\nAs most of the evidence is of US origin, we shall employ the American term in this paper,\n^ Cranshaw (4) provides corroboratory evidence about the performance of UK unit trusts. How-\never his methodology is different to Jensen's and therefore will be the subject of further\ncomment below.\nAt the time of writing, only Part 1 has been published (20), Thanks are due to R, Stapleton\nfor providing us with a copy of the full manuscript (19).\nA\nWill hold exactly, that is, in the sense that the regression parameters will have the precise\nmagnitudes of (2) and (3), It does not however follow that the fit of the regression line\ncounterpart of (1) will account for all or even most of rj's variation. In an empirical test of\nthe CAPM the calculated Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression Une will be\nwhen Ip is on the efficient frontier, then (as shown below in this section) a j^ and ajjhave\nthe pretise values given in (2) and (3), regardless of the ' goodness of fit\" (given by the R ,\nsay) of (la). Equation (1) is just the sample mean of (la).\nNote that the assumption of r^  = rj is not independent of the assumption of the efficiency\nof the market portfolio. The very existence of portfolio z is dependent on the market port-\nfolio being efficient. Moreover, the difference i, - tr depends on the position of the market\nportfolio on the efficient frontier. The sign of this ditterence also depends on the position of rj-\nin relation to the return on the global minimum variance portfolio.\nAn Arbitrage Rationale for Tests of Mutual Fund Perfonnance 39 7\n* Implicit in such tests of the CAPM is the assumption that the proxy for the market portfolio\nis efficient.\nThis may be due, of course, to the choice of market proxy,\n* Identity (6) cari be shown to be consistent with (and a simplication oO Roll's (20, p,168)\nidentity A,23, as follows. Taking the j-th row of Roll's equations A,23 , with suitable\nchanges in notation, yields\n'j = 'f + (^ M - f ) J\n- ' ' M i\nwhere Xpj and Xj^ j are the weights of security i in portfolios P and M , respectively,\nsuch that i : x p i = S X [ ^ j = l , The expression after the summation sign i; reduces to\ni i\ncov(ri, rp) o ^ \/ Op - cov(rj, r^^).\nSubstituting the definitions of beta, the above reduces to identity (6),\nft\nThis can easily be seen as follows. For the third term of (6) to vanish we require ftp = (Jjjyj ,\nhence that J '\ncov(rj , rp) \/ Op = cov(rj , r^j) \/ a ^ (6a)\nRecall that Op f a ^ , by definition. Equation (6a) can be expanded as\nN 7 ^\n^ Xpj cov(rj , r;) \/ Op = E xv.: cov(rj , r:) \/ Ow (8)\ni=l ' \"^  i=l \u2022\" ^\nFor M and P to be different portfolios,the weights of at least two securities must differ. If\nwe assume that out of the universe of N securities only two do so (securities 1 and 2, say),\nwe still cannot cancel out the remaining N-2 terms in (8) because they are normalised by\nvariances of possibly different magnitudes. Hence all N terms must be considered, making\nthe required equality highly improbable.\nIt is important to recognise that zero a: does not imply the efficiency of the benchmark\nmarket portfolio. Roll shows that efficietlcy can only be inferred if return-beta linearity is\nobserved for each individual security comprising the market portfolio. Thus whilst it is\npossible to infer that Oj = 0 if the market portfolio is efficient, it is not possible to infer\nthe converse that Cfc = U implies that the market portfolio is efficient, (We are grateful to\nBill Furig for pointing this out to us,) For the purpose of evaluating fund performance, it\nis the first direction of causality which is important.\nThis is the first of the two tests Cranshaw reports; in the second test he uses the CAPM to\nadjust for risk,\n' ^ cf, note 7,\nRecall that for the GAPM to hold exactly (approximately) the market portfolio must be\nexactly (approximately) on the efficient frontier. What we are assuming here is that both\nthe market portfolio and the proxy for the market portfolio u,sed in assessing fund perfor-\nmance are efficient, viewed both ex ante and ex post. This enables us to disregard the lower-\norder problems arising from the market proxy behaving differently to the value-weighted\n398 K. V. Peasnell, L.C.L. Skerratt and P.A.
