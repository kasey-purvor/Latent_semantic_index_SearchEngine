PLOS Biology, (correspondence). Vol. 6, No. 2, e28 \ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pbio.0060028 \n \nWhen human understanding of fish invasion is blurred \nRodolphe Elie GOZLAN \nReader in Conservation Ecology \nBournemouth University \nE-mail \nCompeting Interests: None \nSubmitted Date: February 27, 2008  \nPublished: February 28, 2008  \nLeprieur et al.\u2019s observation that fish invasions are blurred by human activity (Leprieur et al. 2008 \ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pbio.0060028) correctly reflected the well established understanding that fish \ninvasion is human mediated (1-4). \n \nHowever, shortcomings in Leprieur et al\u2019s (2008) article stem from confusion between introduction \nand invasion, a crude analysis of human activity which has lead to a misrepresentation of introduction \nhotspots and lastly, a misunderstanding of ecological impacts associated with non-native fish \nintroduction. \n \nFirst, the article refers indiscriminately to fish introductions and invasions. These terms, although \noften misused, have different meanings and ecological implications. A fish introduction is a deliberate \nor accidental release of a novel species into a specific water while an invasion is a process whereby an \nintroduced fish species has established, spread rapidly and presents a risk to native species. In \nbuilding the database on self reproducing populations of novel species within a given river basin, the \nauthors have analysed fish introductions in the world\u2019s river systems rather than fish invasion. \nSubsequently, they identify six non-native fish introduction hotspots, not invasion hotspots. This has \ngreat implications for global understanding and forecasting of ecological impacts and possibly \nbiodiversity losses associated with fish introductions.  \n \nIn calculating human activity, the authors used a combination of human population density and \npurchase power (GDP). This combination has generated a bias toward wealthy populated regions. \nThus Australia and New Zealand rather than Asian countries emerged as \u201cinvasion hotspots\u201d. But, for \nhistorical geographical and cultural reasons, countries such as the Philippines, China, Japan and \nSingapore represent half of the total number of fish introductions in Asia (n= 1056) with 25% of all \nthese introductions for the Philippines alone [3]. An understanding in fine of human activity \nresponsible for fish introductions worldwide [3] would have helped to correct the models predictions. \nOut of the 624 fish species introduced worldwide, 91% can be explained by a need for food (51%), \nhobbyist fish (21%), angling or sport (12%) or fisheries (7%). The level of non-native introductions in \na given FAO region is in fact determined by the level of aquaculture production [3]. Asia, driven by the \ncountries mentioned above, has the highest aquaculture production of freshwater fish (circa 300 \nmillion tonnes of fish in 2004) and the highest ranking for global import\/export of non-native \nfreshwater fish.  \n \nFinally, not all fish introductions result in invasion or harm native species and disturb ecosystem \nprocesses [3]. Species recognised as having the greatest detrimental impacts on ecosystem \nfunctioning are those that are typically ecosystem engineers. However, the overall probability of an \necological impact resulting from freshwater fish introductions is relatively low (circa 6%, see [3]). \nHighlighting hotspots as a tool to tackle conservation strategies is simply incorrect. Introduction of \nNile perch in Lake Victoria is a good example of a single introduction being responsible for a great loss \nin fish biodiversity despite being independent from propagule pressure and outside the \u201cSouth African \nhotspot\u201d. References to plants and higher vertebrate introductions to support the idea that non-native \nfish are a key component of human-induced biodiversity crisis is misleading and not supported by \nevidence [3]. It is about time that our understanding of ecological impact and fish invasion developed \nbeyond such generalities as in Leprieur et al (2008). This can only contribute to blurring human \nunderstanding of fish invasion.  \n \n \n1. Copp G.H. et al. (2007) J. Fish Biol. 71, 148-159. \n2. Duggan I.C.et al. (2006) Biol.
