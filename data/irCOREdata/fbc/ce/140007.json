Recent examples include nano silver coatings on 24 \nsocks to inhibit microbial growth and hence odour (Ross, 2004) and zero valent iron nano 25 \nparticles for groundwater remediation (Huang et al., 2008; Ahmadimoghaddam et al., 2008). 26 \nWhilst research is continuing into developing new nanoparticles actual uptake of the existing 27 \nones is rather limited in water treatment (Jefferson, 2008). The problem is a classical chemical 28 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n2 \nengineering one: how to implement (scale up) a nano scale process at the meso or macro scale 29 \n(Wintermantel, 1999). For context, water treatment facilities vary greatly but typically treat 30 \nflows in the order of 10s to 100s of ML.d-1. Converted to nano particles, which are typically 31 \nin the size range 1-100 nm this equates to 7.2x1026 particles and thus there is a challenge. The 32 \nnano particles provide very large specific surface areas with which to provide high mass 33 \ntransfer and reaction kinetic coefficients yet fixing such a large number of very small particles 34 \nso that they remain in the treatment process and do not exit with the product water is 35 \nextremely challenging. Typical energy and operating costs for water treatment are in the order 36 \nof 0.5 kWh.m-3 and \u20ac0.2-0.5.m-3 which means solutions can not be overly complicated or 37 \ncomplex. Reported solutions to the problem involve either immobilisation to solid substrate 38 \n(Rachel et al, 2002) or retention by filtration with membranes (Rivero et al., 2006; Chin et al, 39 \n2007). 40 \nOne embodiment of this concept is the membrane chemical reactor (MCR) (Parsons et al, 41 \n2000; Jefferson et al, 2001) which utilises nano sized titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles in 42 \ncombination with a UV light source to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals which have 43 \na redox potential of 2.33 V, only surpassed by F2 (Huang et al, 1993). The TiO2 particles are 44 \nretained in the system by means of a membrane filtration unit that is configured externally to 45 \nthe membrane but operated in an air lift, low pressure manner equivalent to that of a 46 \nsubmerged membrane system (LeClech et al, 2003). Long term trials for the treatment of grey 47 \nwater have shown it to be an effective system comparable to that of a membrane bioreactor 48 \n(Pidou et al., 2008). For instance, average effluent residuals of below 10 mg.L-1 for bio-49 \nchemical oxygen demand (BOD), below 1 NTU for turbidity, below 2 mg.L-1 for suspended 50 \nsolids (SS) and no pathogens were observed throughout the trial at a hydraulic residence time 51 \nof 2 hours (Pidou et al., 2008). The observed residual levels mean that the technology is 52 \nviable for treating greywater to the most stringent water quality standards available for urban 53 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n3 \nreuse (Pidou et al, 2007). Consequently, it provides an alternative to biological systems such 54 \nas membrane bioreactors (MBRs) where the small scale of operation, proximity to the end 55 \nusers and the potential for toxic shocks provides a relatively high process failure risk 56 \n(Jefferson et al., 1999; Knops et al., 2007). Similar high performance of photocatalytic 57 \nsystems have been reported for the treatment of dyes (Molinari et al., 2002; Mozia et al., 58 \n2007), humic acid (Lee et al., 2001; Fu et al., 2006; Erdei et al., 2008), bisphenol A 59 \n(Thiruvenkatachari et al., 2005; Chin et al., 2007) or pesticides (Oller et al., 2006; Lhomme et 60 \nal., 2008) hence the appropriateness of the technology as a treatment solution is well 61 \nestablished.  62 \nHowever, during the greywater investigation significant membrane fouling was observed. 63 \nConsequently, the system could only be run for about 10 days at a flux of 5 L.m-2.h-1 (LMH) 64 \nbefore a chemical cleaning of the membrane was necessary (Pidou et al, 2008). This was 65 \nfound to be contradictory to results of a previous study in which the MCR pilot plant was 66 \noperated in batch mode (Rivero et al., 2006). Very little or no fouling was observed during 67 \nthe batch experiments for fluxes up to 120 L.m-2.h-1. Such differences in operation are 68 \nsurprising but the results obtained during the batch operation tests can be explained by the 69 \nfact that the greywater was rapidly treated and consequently for the higher fluxes the TiO2 70 \nwas dispersed in fairly clean water and very little or no fouling was observed. This suggests 71 \nthat the fouling propensity of TiO2 changes significantly in the presence of a waste, in this 72 \ncase greywater.  73 \nA paucity of literature on operation of such photocatalytic hybrid membrane systems, 74 \nespecially for medium to high strength organic wastes, potentially limits the uptake of the 75 \ntechnology to full scale operation. Specifically two key questions remain unanswered: (1) 76 \nhow to develop systems that can treat sensible flows whilst ensuring all the TiO2 in the system 77 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n4 \nis active and hence degrades the organics and (2) how to ensure the membranes does not foul 78 \nin systems that answer question 1.  79 \nThe current paper addresses question 2 by examining the impact of different grey water 80 \nproducts on the fouling behaviour of the system elucidating the major changes in the system 81 \nwhen fouling occurs.  82 \n 83 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 84 \nFiltration system 85 \nA bench-scale filtration system was used to replicate the fouling experienced when operating 86 \nthe membrane chemical reactor (MC-RTM) (Water Innovate Limited, UK). Trials were 87 \nconducted to study the influence of different parameters on titanium dioxide (TiO2) and its 88 \nproperties to foul membranes. This system was composed of a 9-litre PVC tank in which the 89 \nTiO2 and greywater slurry was placed. The slurry was pumped across the membrane module 90 \n(Perspex, 28 cm \u00d7 20 cm \u00d7 8 cm) and back to the reactor at a crossflow velocity of 0.16 m.s-1. 91 \nThe treated water was permeated through the membrane by a peristaltic pump (505Du, 92 \nWatson-Marlow, UK) and a pressure transducer (RS components, UK) was fitted in the 93 \npermeate line to record the trans-membrane pressure (TMP). Because it was a batch system, 94 \nthe permeate was sent back into the tank to avoid any volume loss. The membranes used in 95 \nthe module were polyethylene sheets with a pore size of 0.4 \u00b5m and a surface area of 0.019 96 \nm2. 97 \n 98 \nMethods 99 \nA range of products (all bought in a supermarket) including shower gel, shampoo, bathroom 100 \ncleaner, conditioner, hand soap and bubble bath were diluted in tap water at a concentration of 101 \n2 or 3 g.L-1 and placed in the reactor with 5 g.L-1 of TiO2. These concentrations were chosen 102 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5 \nbecause they represent the upper range for organic concentrations reported in the literature in 103 \nterms of COD in feed grey waters from sampled sites around the world (Pidou et al., 2007). 104 \nThe COD concentration of the products were measured prior to use at 360, 280, 280, 250, 190 105 \nmg.L-1 for the shower gel, conditioner, bubble bath, shampoo and hand soap respectively. 106 \nIndeed, concentrations of products of 3 g.L-1 corresponded to solutions with COD 107 \nconcentrations between 570 and 890 mg.L-1. The TiO2 dose was selected from previous trials 108 \nwhich demonstrated it be the optimum concentration for grey water treatment (Rivero et al., 109 \n2006). Ingredients of each of the products as listed in provided in Table 1. Tests using the flux 110 \nstep method generally used to characterise membrane fouling in MBRs (Le Clech et al., 2003) 111 \nwere then carried out and the fouling rates determined for the different slurries. Fouling 112 \nexperiments were conducted under dark light conditions to best replicate practical system 113 \nwhere the membrane is configured such that it is not in direct contact with the UV light to 114 \nprevent damage to the membrane structure (Rivero et al., 2006). All tests were duplicated. For 115 \nthe photo-catalysis tests, the slurry was placed in a stirred tank under a 100W UVA lamp 116 \n(Black-Ray, CA, USA) for a range of time ranging between 0.5 and 2 hours. 117 \n 118 \nAnalytical procedures  119 \nParticle sizes were measured with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle analyser (Malvern 120 \nInstruments Ltd, Worcestershire, UK). It was not possible to measure the particle size with 121 \nthe TiO2 concentration of  5 g.L-1 as the detection cell saturated because of too many particles. 122 \nConsequently, the TiO2 concentration had to be decreased to 1 g.L-1. Product concentrations 123 \nwere reduced commensurately to maintain a dose ratio between 400-600 mg.gTiO2-1 to match 124 \nexperiments in the fouling trials. Five measurements of each sample were performed and the 125 \naverage value of the median particle size d50 (\u00b5m) was taken. 126 \nRESULTS 127 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n6 \nCross flow filtration of organo-TiO2 slurries containing bathroom cleaner, shampoo, hand 128 \nsoap or bubble bath dosed at a level of 600 mg.gTiO2-1 resulted in insignificant fouling across 129 \nthe range of fluxes studied with a maximum fouling rate of 0.6 mbar.min-1 (Figure 1) and was 130 \nnot significantly different from the TiO2 system in tap water only. Consequently, the flux 131 \nrequired to generate rapid fouling of such systems exceeded the maximum value tested in the 132 \nlaboratory set up and supports the previous finding that TiO2 systems can be operated at 133 \nfluxes around 100 LMH without fouling problems (Rivero et al, 2006). In contrast, cross flow 134 \nfiltration of shower gel, conditioner or real greywater samples results in significant fouling 135 \n(Figure 1). To illustrate maximum fouling rates of 6.6 mbar.min-1 at a flux of 35 LMH and 8.9 136 \nmbar.min-1 at a flux of 28 LMH were observed for the conditioner and shower gel 137 \nrespectively. In comparison, a real greywater collected from the bathrooms of a student hall of 138 \nresidence revealed a fouling propensity in between those observed for the individual products. 139 \nThis is consistent with the fact that the greywater would be made up of a mix of these 140 \nproducts. Consequently, the fouling behaviour of oragno-TiO2 mixtures appears to be related 141 \nto the character of the organics bound to the TiO2 surfaces. Comparison between the current 142 \nsystem and more traditional hybrid membrane reactor processes such as MBRs suggests that 143 \nthe MCR setup is potentially not bound to the same limitations as MBRs as it potentially can 144 \noperate at significantly higher fluxes (Pollice et al., 2005; Le Clech et al., 2003 and 2005). To 145 \nillustrate, an example set of data is included in Figure 1 with the fouling profile for an MBR 146 \ntreating greywater. At fluxes below 25 LMH the fouling rate remains low at 0.6 mbar.min-1 147 \nwhereas beyond this limit the fouling rate increase dramatically reaching a maximum 148 \nmeasured value of 8.1 mbar.min-1 at a flux of 35 LMH (Figure 1). Based on an operational 149 \ndescription, the critical flux is defined as the crossover between these phases (Brookes et al, 150 \n2006) and in the current case is defined as 22 LMH which indicates an upper limit for 151 \noperational practice. Comparison with literature values reveals a similar range for both critical 152 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n7 \nflux (6-32 LMH) and fouling rate (0.1-10 mbar.min-1) for operational MBR systems (Pollice 153 \net al., 2005; Le Clech et al., 2003 and 2005) confirming the potential differences between 154 \nMCR and MBRs.   155 \nMore detailed analysis of the link between the character of organo-TiO2 mixtures and fouling 156 \nrevealed the dose ratio to be significant (Figure 2) with reduced fouling as the organic content 157 \nwithin the TiO2 matrix decreased. To illustrate, in the case of shower gel as the organic 158 \nsource, fouling rates of 8.9, 3.8, 1.6 and 0.2 mbar.min-1 were observed at a flux of 28 LMH 159 \nfor dose ratios of 600, 400, 200 and 100 mg.gTiO2 (Figure 2a). A similar situation was 160 \nobserved in the case of systems based on conditioner mixtures where the fouling rate 161 \nobserved at a flux of 30 LMH was 1.8, 0.9, 0.1 for dose ratios of 600, 400 and 200 mg.gTiO2 162 \nindicating that fouling can be controlled in the system by limiting the concentration of certain 163 \ntypes of organics in the system (Figure 2b). Examples of previously reported investigations of 164 \nmembrane couple photocatalytic processes have focussed on dilute systems with slurry 165 \nconcentrations of <1 g.L-1 and low organic feeds resulting in dose ratios of 10mgdye.g-1 for 166 \nmethylene blue dye (Sopajaree et al, 1999), 48mgTOC.g-1 for fulvic acid (Fu et al, 2006) 167 \ncompared to 114-178 mgCOD.g-1 investigated here at TiO2 doses of 5 g.L-1. In dilute 168 \nconditions, reaction rates have been seen to increase as slurry concentration increases (and 169 \ndose ratio decreases) as an impact of enhanced mass transfer of the catalyst to the lamp 170 \nalthough fouling is also seen to increase as slurry dose increases (Sopajaree et al, 1999). 171 \nComparison between different commercially available shower gels revealed only the original 172 \nchoice of product resulted in the extreme fouling pattern (Figure 3). For instance, fouling rates 173 \nremained low and stable at a rate between 0.1 and 0.4 mbar.min-1 up to fluxes of 70 LMH for 174 \nfour alternative brands of shower gels. All five products are commonly available and range 175 \nfrom leading brands to unbranded and environmentally labelled versions. Identification of 176 \nspecific chemicals associated to the observed results is difficult as exact product contents are 177 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n8 \nnot available. However comparison of the ingredient lists suggests that the major differences 178 \nobserved are associated with the inclusion of a polymer (Palmeth 25 Acrylate copolymere) in 179 \nthe shower gel.  180 \nAnalysis of the size of the TiO2 in the system revealed that in the absence of organics the 181 \nTiO2 aggregates had a median floc size of 15,000 nm and a maximum size of 120,000 nm 182 \n(Figure 4) which equate to 300-2400 NP diameters demonstrating the significant role 183 \naggregation plays in the system. Analysis of the organo-TiO2 complexes revealed a 184 \nsignificant difference with the median size altered to 290,000 nm for a non fouling component 185 \nand to 1,102,000 nm (22,040 NP diameters) in the case of the shower gel that caused rapid 186 \nfouling. The mixed greywater from the student flats produced a median floc size between the 187 \nextremes of 130,000 nm which are much larger than previous reported sizing of organo-TiO2 188 \naggregates at around a median size of 1-3000 nm (Ollis, 2003; Choo et al, 2008). 189 \nConsequently, addition of organics did not significantly alter the size of the aggregating 190 \nsystem apart from specific products which could generate over a 7000% increase in the 191 \naggregate size. This observation is compatible with the inclusion of polymers in general as 192 \nthey principally act as aggregating chemicals (Henderson et al, 2009). Comparison with 193 \nfouling rate data revealed a power law relationship of the form dP\/dt = \u03b1d50\u03b2 with exponents 194 \nof \u03b1 = 0.019 and \u03b2 = 0.83 at a flux of 30 LMH and \u03b1 = 0.061 and \u03b2 = 0.27 at a flux of 15 195 \nLMH indicating the importance of aggregate size on fouling in the system.  196 \nFouling rates of the high fouling systems were reduced to a level similar to those observed for 197 \nthe other systems after irradiation under UV light for 16 hours, a time period previously 198 \nobserved to ensure complete irradiation. Similar results were observed for all three organo-199 \nTiO2 complexes that caused fouling (Figure 5). For instances, fouling rates at 30 LMH 200 \ndecreased from previous levels of 0.3, 1.9 and 1.3 for the shampoo, conditioner and mixed 201 \ngreywater systems to between 0.02-0.13 mbar.min-1 after irradiation. Further, fouling rates did 202 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n9 \nnot increase up to the maximum flux tested in the set up of 70 LMH (Figure 5a) confirming 203 \nthe previous findings of Rivero et al (2006) indicating the importance of effective treatment in 204 \nthe UV stage of the process if stable operation is to be achieved. More detailed analysis in the 205 \ncase of the shower gel system revealed a reduction in fouling rate as irradiation time was 206 \nincreased from 30 minutes to 120 minutes suggesting that a minimum amount of irradiation is 207 \nrequired to treat the audit of TiO2 surface within the system. To illustrate, fouling rates of 208 \n10.9, 4.7, 0.9 and 0.7 mbar.min-1 were observed at a flux rate of 50 LMH after irradiation for 209 \n30, 45, 90 and 120 minutes respectively (Figure 5b). Significant fouling reduction has also 210 \nbeen observed in a photocatalytic hybrid membrane reactor treating humic acids where a 120 211 \nminute reaction time resulted in flux recover to more than 80% of the clean water flux (Fang 212 \net al, 2005). The results suggest that in the set up investigated in the current study a minimum 213 \nUV residence time of 120 minutes in the CSTR tank is required to reduce fouling to 214 \nacceptable levels. A key question for the future relates to understanding how much organic 215 \nmaterial must be removed from the TiO2 surface to reduce fouling. Circumstantially it would 216 \nappear that almost complete removal of the organics is necessary due to the relationship 217 \nbetween irradiation time and fouling. Ultimately, successful reactor design will need to based 218 \non an understanding of this issue to deliver the most economic technology possible.  219 \nDISCUSSION 220 \nThe work presented in the current study demonstrates one of the barriers to implementation of 221 \nhybrid membrane processes utilising photo catalysis, namely, the potential for rapid fouling 222 \ndue to undesirable changes to the aggregates of nano TiO2 when combined with specific 223 \nchemicals. In the current case this appears to be related to the presence of polymers within 224 \nsome greywater products which greatly enhance the aggregation process forming very large 225 \norgano-TiO2 aggregates that reduce the operating flux achievable within the system.  226 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n10 \nThe exact reason for the impact of aggregate size on fouling are not currently clear but are 227 \nlikely to reflect one or a combination of possible effects. Larger aggregates are more likely to 228 \nbreak when exposed to an elevated energy dissipation field (Jarvis et al, 2005) such as in the 229 \nreactor or the membrane tank and hence the much larger aggregates formed with the shower 230 \ngel are likely to generate significant quantities of fines which can clog the membrane pores 231 \n(Jefferson et al, 2004). The larger aggregates are also less likely to receive uniform UV 232 \nexposure over the whole organo-TiO2 surface increasing the risk that only a proportion of the 233 \nTiO2 is photo catalysed and hence not effectively treated. At the slurry concentrations under 234 \ninvestigation here (5g.L-1) modelled light intensity patterns suggest that illumination occurs 235 \nonly very close to the lamp (Pareek et al, 2003) such that only TiO2 surfaces that effectively 236 \ncontact the lamp will be treated. In fact illuminations effectively drops off once the catalyst 237 \nloadings reaches 0.1 g.L-1.  238 \nIn the case of horizontal configured membranes, such as the cross flow test membrane 239 \nsystems used here, another factor needs to be considered in terms of the inertial lift generated 240 \nby the cross flow velocity that prevents cake build up and hence critical flux. In the current 241 \ncase inertial lift theory suggests that all but the shower gel aggregates would lift at velocities 242 \nconsiderably below the one used. However, in the case of the shower gel tests the inertial lift 243 \nvelocity is 0.154 m.s-1 which is around the actual velocity the test cell was operated at. Visual 244 \ninspection during the experiments confirmed this although it is an outcome of supra critical 245 \nflux operation rather than a direct cause. As stated earlier the original fouling problem was 246 \nobserved during long term trials with a continuously operating unit with the membrane 247 \nvertically orientated which suggests that cake layer build up through insufficient inertial lift is 248 \nunlikely to be the sole reason but could definitely be responsible for some of the observed 249 \nfouling in the current case. 250 \nCONCLUSIONS 251 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n11 \nUltimately, whatever the mechanism of fouling, management of the organo-TiO2 aggregates 252 \nis crucial for effective operation of such technologies. Given that sufficient irradiation of the 253 \norgano-TiO2 complex resolved the fouling problems in the current study suggests that the key 254 \nto uptake of the technology is in effective design of the UV reactor systems rather than 255 \nimprovements in the membrane. The challenge becomes how to ensure enough of the TIO2 256 \nsurface reacts with the UV light. Transmittance in such systems is generally very low and 257 \nhence TiO2 particles must contact the lamp to ensure treatment. This becomes difficult when 258 \nconsidering large aggregates of sizes in the ranges observed here as they will contain 259 \nthousands of individual TiO2 particles. However, if nanotechnology solutions like the 260 \nmembrane photocatalytic systems are be implemented for large scale water treatment in the 261 \nfuture solutions will need to be generated. Current systems are more suitable to small scale 262 \napplications such as urban reuse of industrial water treatment where flow requirements are 263 \nmore manageable.  264 \n 265 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 266 \nThis work forms part of the \u2018Water Cycle Management for New Developments\u2019 (WaND) 267 \nproject funded under the Engineering & Physical Science Research Council\u2019s \u2018Sustainable 268 \nUrban Environment\u2019 Programme by EPSRC, UK government and industrial collaborators 269 \n[www.wand.uk.net].
