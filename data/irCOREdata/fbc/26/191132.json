We show that \u03b3 -ray photons for two bursts, 050126 and 050219A, for which we have\ncarried out detailed analysis were produced as a result of the synchrotron self-Compton process\nin the material ejected in the explosion when it was heated to a mildly relativistic temperature at\na distance from the centre of explosion of order the deceleration radius.

The technique that we exploit to determine this is\nvery general and makes no assumption about any particular model for \u03b3 -ray generation except\nthat the basic radiation mechanism is some combination of synchrotron and inverse Compton\nprocesses in a relativistic outflow. For GRB 050219A we can rule out the possibility that energy\nfrom the explosion is carried outward by magnetic fields, and that the dissipation of this field\nproduced the \u03b3 -ray burst.\nKey words: hydrodynamics \u2013 shock waves \u2013 gamma-rays: bursts.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe successful launch of the Swift satellite in 2004 November filled\na crucial gap in the \u03b3 -ray burst (GRB) data at early times \u2013 between\na minute and a few hours \u2013 that existed in prior GRB missions.\nThis has led to a number of very interesting discoveries regarding\nemission from GRBs on time-scales of minutes following a burst.\nOne of these discoveries is that the very early X-ray light curve\n(LC) of many bursts falls off very rapidly: f x \u221d t\u22123 (Tagliaferri\net al. 2005; Goad et al. 2005; Burrows et al. 2005; Chincarini et al.\n2005). This phase of rapid fall-off lasts for about 5 min, and is fol-\nlowed by the usual f x \u221d t\u22121 behaviour. In most cases, no change\nto the spectral slope is seen accompanying the change to the light\ncurve. In this paper, we discuss two bursts exhibiting such behaviour,\nGRBs 050126 and 050219A. We provide an argument that the\n\u03b3 -rays and the early X-rays (for the first \u223c5 min) have a com-\nmon source, and we determine the physical properties of the source\n(next section).\n\u0002E-mail: pk@astro.as.utexas.edu\n2 M O D E L L I N G P RO M P T \u03b3- R AY\nA N D A F T E R G L OW E M I S S I O N S\nWe start with some very general physical considerations and de-\nscribe a model with as few assumptions as possible to try to under-\nstand the \u03b3 -ray and X-ray emissions together.\nWe do not assume that \u03b3 -rays are produced in the internal shock or\nexternal shock or any other of a number of different models that have\nbeen suggested. We determine the properties of the \u03b3 -ray source\nfrom the data and use them to decide which of the proposed models,\nif any, work. The only assumption that we make is that \u03b3 -rays are\ngenerated by synchrotron or inverse Compton (IC) mechanisms \u2013 an\nassumption that is supported by their non-thermal spectrum and also\nindirectly by the excellent overall agreement between models based\non synchrotron and IC emission and multiwavelength afterglow data\nfor a large number of GRBs (Granot, Piran & Sari 1999; Me\u00b4sza\u00b4ros\n& Rees 1999; Panaitescu & Kumar 2002; Piran 2005).\nThe two bursts considered here have \u03b3 -ray light curves dominated\nby a single peak and small fluctuations, and therefore much of the\n\u03b3 -ray flux is probably produced in a single source localized in space.\nIn such a case the synchrotron and IC emissions from the object are\ncompletely determined if we know the magnetic field strength (B),\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nUnified GRB and X-ray afterglow emissions L53\nthe optical thickness of the object to Thomson scattering (\u03c4 e), the\nspeed of the object toward the observer (Lorentz factor, LF \u2013 \u0005),\nthe total number of radiating particles assuming an isotropic source\n(N), and the minimum energy for radiating particles, \u03b3 im ec2(m e is\nthe electron mass and c is the speed of light). The particle energy\ndistribution above \u03b3 i, at the acceleration region where particles have\nnot suffered appreciable loss of energy, is assumed to be a power-\nlaw function with index p. The energy distribution of particles for\nthe entire population, however, is not a single power-law function\ndue to the loss of energy via radiative processes. We determine this\nmodified distribution numerically by carrying out a self-consistent\ncalculation of synchrotron cooling and self-absorption frequencies\nas described by Panaitescu & Me\u00b4sza\u00b4ros (2000) and McMahon,\nKumar & Piran (2006).\nThe average energy per particle, at the acceleration site, in the\ncomoving frame of the source is \u0006 = \u03b3 im ec2(p \u2212 1)\/(p \u2212 2),\nand therefore N \u2248 E iso\/\u0006\u0005, where E iso is the isotropic equivalent\nof energy in \u03b3 -rays. The index p is determined by the observed\nspectral index; we take p = 2.4 when the spectrum above the peak is\nnot known \u2013 results reported here have been checked for dependence\non p, and found qualitatively to be insensitive to p.\nSo we are left with four unknown parameters, namely B, \u03c4 e, \u0005\nand \u03b3 i. The observational constraints on these parameters are the\n\u03b3 -ray flux at the peak of the observed light curve, the frequency\nat which the spectrum peaks, the duration of the burst, the spectral\nindex below the peak, and the optical flux limit (when available).\nThe last two constraints are not independent and typically provide\na limit on synchrotron cooling and\/or injection frequencies.\nThe optical depth, \u03c4 e, and N determine the distance of the \u03b3 -\nray source from the centre of the explosion: r = \u221aN\u03c3T\/4\u03c0\u03c4e;\nand the burst duration t GRB \u2248 r\/2\u00052c. The parameters that we use\ndescribe the state of the \u03b3 -ray-producing source at the time of the\npeak of the observed light curve. The observed peak flux is the\nsynchrotron or IC flux in the appropriate observer energy band which\nis determined from B, N (the total number of electrons\/positrons in\nthe source), \u03c4 e, \u03b3 i and \u0005; the details of the calculation are described\nin Kumar et al. (in preparation). By searching the parameter space\n(B, \u03c4 e, \u0005, \u03b3 i) for emission properties consistent with those observed\nfor each burst, we can decide among various GRB models. As we\nshall see, we are led to more or less a unique solution: \u03b3 -rays are\ngenerated via synchrotron-self-IC (SSC) in a source with typical\nelectron energy less than 103m ec2 and with properties that favour\nthe external reverse-shock or internal shocks. Moreover, the \u03b3 -ray\nsource we thus find also accounts for the early X-ray afterglow in\na natural way, as off-axis flux from the \u03b3 -ray-emitting material or\nflux from the adiabatically cooling source.\nResults for 050126 and 050219A are discussed below.\n2.1 GRB 050126\nGRB 050126 was 25 s long with a fluence in the 15\u2013350 keV band\nof 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122, and redshift 1.29 (Tagliaferri et al.\n2005). The average spectral index \u03b2 ( f \u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b2 ) during the burst was\n\u22120.34 \u00b1 0.14, and during the X-ray afterglow the spectral index\nwas \u03b2 = \u22121.35 \u00b1 0.3 and the LC fell off as t\u22122.52+0.5\u22120.2 . We describe\nthe results for \u03b3 -ray and X-ray emissions below.\n2.1.1 \u03b3 -ray generation via the synchrotron process\nFig. 1 shows the parameter space allowed \u2013 for a source radiating\nvia the synchrotron process \u2013 to explain the observed \u03b3 -ray data\nfor 050126. In particular we show the allowed range for \u03b3 i, B, \u00051\nFigure 1. The parameter space for the synchrotron radiation solution to\nGRB 050126. The x-axis is the radial distance of the \u03b3 -ray source from the\ncentre of explosion. Shown in the figure is the minimum energy of electrons\ndivided by their rest mass (\u03b3 i) at the location where these particles are\naccelerated in the source, i.e. where radiative losses are unimportant. Also\nshown are the comoving magnetic field (B) in gauss, and the LFs of the\nunshocked shells and medium, \u00051 and \u00052. \u00051 = \u0005\u0005 sh(1 + vv sh) is the LF\nof the inner unshocked shell, where \u0005 sh = (p \u2212 1)\u03b3 i m e\/(p \u2212 2)mp is the\nminimum LF of the shock front with respect to the unshocked shell \u2013 this\nassumes that electrons have the same energy as protons (\u0005 sh will be larger\nif electrons have lower energy) \u2013 and \u0005 is the LF of the shocked material\nas seen by a laboratory frame observer. \u00052 is the LF of the unshocked outer\nshell\/medium and is given by \u0005\u0005 sh(1 \u2212 vv sh). The calculations of \u00051 and \u00052\nare valid when the \u03b3 -ray-producing shell\/medium is the inner and the outer\nshell respectively, and they are also valid for most internal shell collision\nsituations where the shock front speed in the two shells is about the same.\nFor these calculations we took E iso = 1052 erg, p = 2.4, z = 1.29, and the\nflux at 150 keV at the peak of the \u03b3 -ray LC (7 s) to be 0.2 mJy. We used a\nfactor of 2 tolerance in all of the observational data such as \u03b3 -ray flux, burst\nduration etc. in constructing the acceptable solution parameter space.\n(the lower limit to the LF of the unshocked shell which produced\nthe \u03b3 -ray photons when it was shock-heated \u2013 we will refer to it as\nshell 1), and the upper limit to the LF of the shell or the medium\nwith which shell 1 collided (\u00052); the figure caption describes how\n\u00051 and \u00052 are calculated. These quantities are plotted against the\nradius, r, at which \u03b3 -rays are generated, to determine which GRB\nmodel could be described by the four-parameter solution space.\nThe solutions that we find have \u03b3 i > 3000, and a high magnetic\nfield strength is needed to explain the \u03b3 -ray emission for this burst if\nit were to arise as a result of synchrotron emission. The synchrotron\ncooling frequency is found to be less than a few eV, which is in part\ndue to the constraint that the low-energy spectral index is \u22120.34 \u00b1\n0.14 (so all of the solutions are in the highly radiative cooling\nregime). The radius where the observed \u03b3 -rays could have been\ngenerated varies from the typical internal shock radius of \u223c1014 cm\nto the external shock radius of\u223c 1016 cm; the lower limit to the radius\nis due to our choice of \u03c4e < 0.1 in order to avoid excessive Compton\nscattering \u2013 for \u03c4e = 1 the minimum r is a factor of 2 smaller. In\nthe case of internal shocks we find that the LF of the two colliding\nshells must satisfy the conditions \u00051 \u0002 103 and \u00052 \u0003 3 (see Fig. 1),\nwhich seems an unrealistic requirement for any central engine to\nmeet, and in any case this situation would not be that different from\nthe interaction of GRB ejecta with the interstellar medium where\n\u00052 = 1. Note that the time interval between the ejection of the two\nshells (with \u00051 = 103 and \u00052 = 2) is larger than 500 s for the internal\nshock radius of r \u223c 1014 cm, while the duration of this burst was\n25 s \u2013 this is another problem for this solution. Furthermore, the fact\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 367, L52\u2013L56\nL54 P. Kumar et al.\nFigure 2. The parameter space for the synchrotron-self-IC solution to GRB\n050126. Shown in the figure are the allowed range for \u03b3 i, \u0005 (the LF of the\n\u03b3 -ray source) and B (the comoving magnetic field strength in gauss). See\nthe caption of Fig. 1 for some relevant details about the calculation.\nthat the GRB LC was a FRED (fast rise, exponential decline) means\nthat internal shocks are not required to generate the \u03b3 -ray emission.\nThe allowed parameter space contains an external forward-shock\nsolution as well (r \u223c 1016 cm; \u00052 = 1). This solution, however,\nrequires \u0005 > 104 (Fig. 1) which makes the already acute problem\nof baryonic loading much worse. Moreover, the deceleration radius\nfor this large \u0005, for a typical GRB\u2013circumstellar medium density\nof \u223c10 cm\u22123, is less than 1016 cm \u2013 the distance at which the \u03b3 -ray\nsource according to our solution is located. Therefore we conclude\nthat \u03b3 -rays from 050126 are unlikely to have been produced via the\nsynchrotron process in internal or external shocks.\n2.1.2 Gamma-ray production via the inverse Compton process\nFig. 2 shows the allowed parameter space for synchrotron-self-IC\nsolutions. The entire solution space consists of mildly relativistic\nshocks with 2 < \u03b3 i < 1000, and the LF of the source is between\n20 and 300. Mildly relativistic shocks arise naturally in internal\ncollisions (with the ratio of LFs for colliding shells of the order of\na few) and the external reverse-shock (RS). A good fraction of the\nallowed parameter space has electron cooling time, due to radiative\nlosses, of the order of the dynamical time or less, and the synchrotron\ncooling frequency is of the order of a few eV. The magnetic field\nstrength is about 50 gauss (which corresponds to \u0006 B \u223c 0.1) and\nCompton Y \u223c 1 for the part of parameter space corresponding to\nRSs, whereas B is between 1 and 103 gauss and 1 \u0003 Y \u0003 104 for\ninternal shocks. The IC \u03b3 -ray light curve falls off very rapidly for\nboth the internal and the RS emission, as does the observed LC\n(Kobayashi et al. 2005). Therefore \u03b3 -rays from 050126 could have\nbeen produced via SSC in either internal or external shocks, and we\ndo not see any reason to prefer one solution over the other for this\nburst.\n2.1.3 X-ray afterglow\nIs it possible that the early X-ray afterglow was produced by the\nsame source as the GRB IC photons? The IC cooling frequency,\n\u03bdICc \u223c \u03bd c\u03b3 2c , at the GRB LC peak (7s) is typically of the order of\na few hundred keV for the allowed parameter space for this burst.\nSince \u03bdICc shifts to lower energies because of adiabatic cooling, as\n\u223ct\u22122, at 100 s it will have dropped to \u223c1 keV. In this case the flux\nin the XRT band at 100 s from the \u03b8 \u0003 \u0005\u22121 part of the source will\nbe very small, and will rapidly drop to zero on a short time-scale.\nThe early X-ray LC could be explained by this adiabatically cooling\n\u03b3 -ray source provided that \u03bdICc \u0002 10 MeV at 7 s, which is somewhat\noutside the parameter space that we find for this burst.\nCould photons detected by the XRT in the 0.2\u201310 keV band at t >\n100 s be off-axis photons (Kumar & Panaitescu 2000) that originate\nat the source at an angle with respect to the line of sight >\u0005\u22121?\nThe flux at 10 keV at the peak of the GRB 050126 light curve was\n0.54 \u00b1 0.08 mJy. This gives a flux1 at 100 s due to off-axis emission\nof 1.1 \u00b1 .15 \u03bcJy, in rough agreement with the XRT measurement\nof 2.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcJy. The X-ray LC between 100 and 425 s declined\nas t\u22122.52\n+0.5\n\u22120.22\n. This decline is also consistent with that expected of\noff-axis emission; \u03b2 = 1.26 \u00b1 0.22 during this period would give\nrise to an off-axis LC decaying as t\u22123.26\u00b10.22. The spectral peak for\nthe off-axis emission from a uniform jet decreases with time as 1\/t,\nand so the peak at 100 s is at \u223c10 keV. The peak frequency decreases\nmore rapidly when electron energy and\/or magnetic field is smaller\nat higher \u03b8 . In this case the spectral peak will be below 10 keV, and\n\u03b2 in the XRT band, for t > 100 s, smaller than during the GRB. We\nnote that a decrease of \u03b3 i and B would not lead to a decrease in the\nflux in the XRT band so long as these changes were accompanied by\nan increase in the number of radiating particles as might be expected,\nfor instance, when \u0005 decreases with \u03b8 but the energy per unit solid\nangle is roughly constant. The angular structure of the ejecta can be\nconstrained by the difference between the observed spectral peaks\nat 100 s and during the burst.\n2.2 GRB 050219A\nGRB 050219A was 23.6 s long with fluence in the BAT\/Swift 15\u2013\n350 keV band of 5.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122. The average spectral\nindex \u03b2 during the burst was 0.75 \u00b1 0.30 ( f \u03bd \u221d \u03bd0.75\u00b10.30), and the\npeak of the spectrum was at 90 \u00b1 9 keV (Tagliaferri et al. 2005).\nDuring the X-ray afterglow, the spectral index was \u03b2 = \u22121.1 \u00b1\n0.2 and the X-ray LC declined as t\u22123.15\u00b10.22. We describe below the\nmechanism for \u03b3 -ray, X-ray and optical emissions.\n2.2.1 \u03b3 -ray production\nThe positive \u03b2 during the GRB, although consistent with the syn-\nchrotron spectrum of \u03bd1\/3 to within 1.5\u03c3 , rules out the synchrotron\nprocess for the generation of \u03b3 -rays for 050219A. The reason is that\nthe magnetic field required to produce a synchrotron peak frequency\nof 90 keV is sufficiently strong that electrons lose their energy on\na time-scale much less than the duration of the burst (23 s), and in\nthis case the spectrum below 90 keV would be \u223c\u03bd\u22121\/2. 2 This is in\nconflict with the observed spectrum and rules out the synchrotron\nprocess for \u03b3 -ray generation.\nThe IC process, on the other hand, provides a very natural way of\nexplaining the observed spectrum and other properties. The spec-\ntrum produced by IC scattering of a self-absorbed synchrotron\n1 The off-axis flux falls off as t\u22122+\u03b2 [see (Kumar & Panaitescu 2000)], where\n\u03b2 is the spectral index, i.e. f \u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b2 .\n2 A synchrotron frequency of 90 keV implies that B\u03b3 2i \u0005 = 1013 and the\nelectron cooling LF is \u03b3 c\/\u03b3 i \u223c 10\u221217\u03b3 3i \u0005\/t GRB(1 + Y ); the Compton\nparameter Y \u223c \u03c4e\u03b3 i\u03b3 c, and therefore (\u03b3 c\/\u03b3 i)2 \u223c 10\u221217\u03b3 i \u0005\/(\u03c4et GRB),\nwhere t GRB is the burst duration in the host galaxy rest frame. Since \u03c4e >\n10\u22128 and t GRB \u223c 10 s, and \u03b3 i < 103\u0005, we see that \u03b3 c\/\u03b3 i < 1 unless \u0005 >\n3000 which is highly unlikely.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

Shown in the figure are the allowed range of \u03b3 i, \u0005 (the LF of the\n\u03b3 -ray source), the Compton Y parameter, B (the comoving magnetic field\nstrength in gauss), and the predicted optical flux at 100 s for these solutions\n(assuming a burst redshift of 1 and no extinction). The solutions with r <\n4 \u00d7 1015 cm have Y \u0002 104 and are physically unacceptable since the energy\nin the second Compton scattering will be of the order of 1054 erg which is too\nlarge to obtain from a stellar-mass object. Therefore, the only viable solution\nfor the \u03b3 -ray emission is IC in the external RS. We took E iso = 1053 erg,\np = 2.9, z = 1, the peak of the spectrum at 90 keV, and the flux at the peak\nof the \u03b3 -ray LC (15 s) at 90 keV to be 1.2 mJy. We applied the condition\nthat \u03bdICa \u2261 \u03bd a \u00d7 min (\u03b3 i, \u03b3 c)2 \u223c 90 keV; this automatically ensures that\n\u03b2 = 0.75 \u00b1 0.3 as observed. We used a factor of 2 tolerance in all of the\nobservational data such as \u03b3 -ray flux, burst duration, the peak frequency etc.\nin constructing the acceptable solution parameter space.\nradiation is f \u03bd \u221d \u03bd for \u03bd < \u03bd a \u00d7 min(\u03b3 i, \u03b3 c)2 \u2261 \u03bdICa , where \u03bd a\nis the synchrotron self-absorption frequency. For min (\u03b3 i, \u03b3 c) \u223c\n300 and \u03bd a \u223c 1 eV, the peak of the IC spectrum at \u03bdICa is close to the\nobserved value of 90 \u00b1 9 keV. These parameters arise naturally in\nan external RS.\nFig. 3 shows the allowed parameter space for a SSC solution for\nGRB 050219A, assuming z = 1. The range of \u03b3 i for the allowed\nsolutions is 200\u20131500 which is typical for the external RS and for\ninternal shocks, but not the external forward-shock. The magnetic\nfield B is between 0.1 and 20 gauss. This is highly sub-equipartition\n(\u0006 B \u0003 10\u22123), and therefore for 050219A we can rule out the pos-\nsibility that the \u03b3 -ray burst was produced as a result of dissipation\nof magnetic field or that much of the energy of the explosion was\ncarried outward by the magnetic field.\nThe Compton Y is rather large \u2013 of the order of 10\u2013100 for an ex-\nternal shock (r \u223c 1016 cm), and larger than 104 for an internal shock\nradius of r \u223c 1014\u20131015 cm (Fig. 3). One might suspect that the large\nY renders these solutions unphysical since the energy in the second\nCompton scattering, which produces >100 GeV photons, will far\nexceed the \u03b3 -ray energy. However, for low optical depth systems\nwith \u0005 \b 1 the radius of the system increases by about a factor of 2\nin the time that it takes photons to traverse the shell. Therefore the\noptical depth for the second scattering is smaller than the first by a\nfactor of 4, and the electron thermal energy has decreased because\nof adiabatic expansion during this period by a factor of about 4 for\nRS (the shell thickness for RS increases as r 7\/2), and a factor of 2\nfor internal shocks. Thus the effective Y for the second Compton\nscattering is smaller than the first-scattering Compton Y by a factor\nof about 64 for the RS and 16 for internal shocks. For this reason\nY \u223c 100 for the external shock is quite acceptable, as the total en-\nergy requirement is of the order of 1051 erg. However, Y > 104 for\ninternal shocks (see Fig. 3) would require the total energy in the\nexplosion to be \u223c103 times larger than the energy in the \u03b3 -ray band\nand that is highly unlikely considering that E \u03b3 \u223c 1051 erg. There-\nfore the only viable solution for the \u03b3 -ray production for 050219A\nis IC in the external RS-heated ejecta.\n2.2.2 X-ray afterglow\nThere are two mechanisms that can explain the X-ray observations\nfor this burst. One of these is the off-axis emission. The flux at the\npeak of the \u03b3 -ray LC (15 s) at 10 keV was \u223c300 \u03bcJy. Using this\nand \u03bd0.75\u00b10.3, we find the flux at 100 s, due to the off-axis emission\nmechanism ( f \u03bd \u221d t\u22122+\u03b2=\u22121.25\u00b10.3), to be \u223c29 \u00b1 7 \u03bcJy, which is\nconsistent with the observed XRT flux (25 \u00b1 9 \u03bcJy at 10 keV at\n100 s). The LC decay according to the off-axis emission after the\nspectral peak falls through the XRT band is t\u22122+\u03b2 , where \u03b2 =\u22121.1 \u00b1\n0.2 is the spectral index for t > 100 s, and this is consistent with\nthe observed decay of t\u22123.15\u00b10.22. The difference between the X-ray\nafterglow and \u03b3 -ray spectra can be understood in the same way as\ndiscussed for 050126, i.e. the peak of f \u03bd during the GRB (90 keV)\nis well below 10 keV at 100 s if \u03b3 i and B decrease with \u03b8 slightly,\nand this changes the spectrum from \u223c\u03bd0.7 to \u223c\u03bd\u22121. 3\nThe second possibility is that we continue to see radiation from\nwithin \u0005\u22121 angle of the adiabatically cooling \u03b3 -ray source. We find\nthat for a large part of the allowed parameter space for the \u03b3 -ray\nsolution \u03bdICc \u0002 1 MeV, and therefore we expect to receive emission\nin the 0.2\u201310 keV band for a period of about 5 min, during which\ntime the flux decline will be \u223ct\u22122.8, which is consistent with the\nobserved decay.4 We note that the discontinuity in the BAT and\nXRT LCs for thisburst1 could be due to an underestimation of the\nspectral evolution in the 20\u201350 s time interval where the BAT signal\nwas low. A discontinuous jump can also arise in the off-axis model\nas a result of a rapid increase in jet energy for \u03b8 between \u03b3 \u22121 and\n2\u03b3 \u22121.\nBoth of these solutions suggest a common source for the \u03b3 -ray\nburst and early X-rays.\n2.2.3 Optical observations\nThe optical flux at 100 s from the \u03b3 -ray source is shown in Fig. 3.\nFor the RS solution the flux is about 1 mJy whereas the observed\nUVOT\/Swift upper limit at 96 s is 0.02 mJy (Schady et al. 2005).\nThe much smaller optical flux could be due to absorption in the\nhost galaxy. The total hydrogen column density for this burst was1\n2.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122, in excess of the Galactic value, which for a\nburst at z \u223c 1 could give \u223c7 mag of optical extinction, more than\nsufficient to bring the optical flux below the observed upper limit.5\n3 Angular variation is almost unavoidable, because in the absence of it\nthe early X-ray LC would have declined as t\u22121.25 because of the off-axis\nemission.\n4 The IC frequencies for adiabatically cooling ejecta shift with time as t\u22122,\nso the 90-keV peak at 15 s would have shifted to 2 keV at 100 s. During\nthe time when this peak is above the XRT band of 10 keV, the IC flux from\nthe RS decreases very weakly with time (\u223ct\u22120.4), and subsequently the flux\ndecreases as t\u22122.8. The cross-over is expected at about 45 s. Thus the flux\nfrom the RS at 100 s at 10 keV is expected to be about 18 \u00b1 4 \u03bcJy which is\nconsistent with the XRT flux of 25 \u00b1 9 \u03bcJy. The spectrum at 100 s will be\nas expected of IC above \u03bdICa , i.e. roughly \u03bd\u22121.\n5 The Galactic correlation between N H and extinction might not apply to\nGRBs owing to possible dust destruction by GRB emission (Galama &\nWijers 2001). It is therefore difficult to say with confidence the amount of\nextinction for this burst in the V-band.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 367, L52\u2013L56\nL56 P. Kumar et al.\nAlternatively, if the RS occurs at r \u0003 1016 cm the optical flux would\nbe roughly consistent with the observed upper limit (see Fig. 3).\nHowever, in the case Y \u223c 300 the energy in the second Compton-\nscattered photons at 100 GeV will be almost an order of magnitude\nlarger than the energy in \u03b3 -rays.\n3 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe find that the prompt \u03b3 -ray and early (first few minutes) X-ray\nemissions for GRBs 050126 and 050219A are consistent with being\nproduced by the same source. In the case of 050126, the emission\nis inverse Compton (IC) radiation from either internal shocks or the\nexternal reverse-shock (RS), and in the case of 050219A the photons\nare produced by IC in the external RS. The late-time X-rays (t \u0002\n5 min) are produced, as usual, in the forward-shock.\nThese results can be applied to the class of \u03b3 -ray bursts that\nconsist of a simple, i.e. not highly variable, light curve (LC). For\ninstance, our conclusion that \u03b3 -rays were generated via the IC pro-\ncess for GRB 050219A is valid for all those GRBs that, like GRB\n050219A, have a positive low-energy spectral index for the prompt\n\u03b3 -ray emission ( f \u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b2 with \u03b2 > 1). The allowed values for pa-\nrameters \u2013 B, \u0005 and \u03b3 i \u2013 for the source of \u03b3 -rays for any GRB\nconsisting of a single peak in the \u03b3 -ray LC should be similar to that\nshown in Figs 1 and 3 for 050126 and 050219A.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nPK thanks Alin Panaitescu and Jonathan Granot for useful discus-\nsions.
