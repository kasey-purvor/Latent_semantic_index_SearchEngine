To illustrate the applicability of causal methods within randomised trials, we undertook a theory-based\nprocess evaluation study within an implementation trial to explore whether the cognitions of primary care doctors\u2019\npredicted their test requesting behaviours and, secondly, whether the trial results were mediated by the theoretical\nconstructs.\nMethods: The process evaluation comprised a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of a random 50% sample of the\nrandomised groups of primary care practices in Grampian (NHS Grampian), UK, who took part in a trial of the\neffect of enhanced feedback and brief educational reminders on test requesting behaviour. The process evaluation\nwas based upon the Theory of Planned Behaviour and focussed on three of the test requesting behaviours that\nwere targeted in the trial \u2013 ferritin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and Helicobacter Pylori serology (HPS).\nResults: The questionnaire was completed by 131 primary care doctors (56%) from 42 (98%) of the sampled\npractices. Behavioural intention, attitude, and subjective norm were highly correlated for all the tests. There was no\nevidence that perceived behavioural control was correlated with any of the other measures. Simple linear\nregression analysis of the rate of test requests on minimum behavioural intentions had R2 of 11.1%, 12.5%, and\n0.1% for ferritin, FSH, and HPS requesting, respectively. Mediational analysis showed that the trial results for ferritin\nand FSH were partially mediated (between 23% and 78% mediation) through intentions. The HPS trial result was\nnot mediated through intention.\nConclusions: This study demonstrated that a theory-based process evaluation can provide useful information on\ncausal mechanisms that aid not only interpretation of the trial but also inform future evaluations and intervention\ndevelopment.\nIntroduction\nRandomised trials of knowledge translation (KT) strate-\ngies for professional behaviour change can provide\nrobust estimates of effectiveness, but offer little insight\ninto the causal mechanisms by which any change is pro-\nduced. This would not be an issue if interventions had a\nuniform effect across different conditions that could be\ngeneralised to all practitioners outside of the trials.\nHowever, the effects of interventions do appear to vary\nby condition, professional group, and context, presum-\nably because the causal mechanisms of the interventions\nare modified in the presence of different barriers and\nenablers [1]. Therefore the interpretation of a trial and\nassessment of its likely generalisability would be\nenhanced if additional information was obtained about\nthe causal mechanisms through which the intervention\n* Correspondence: c.r.ramsay@abdn.ac.uk\n1Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill,\nAberdeen, AB25 2ZD, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nRamsay et al.

These standard\ndefinitions of constructs and measurement methods\nmay be useful for exploring causal mechanisms of inter-\nventions and barriers and enablers to KT. Theory-based\nprocess evaluations are a relatively new method being\nproposed to collect data on theoretical constructs along-\nside randomised trials to explore possible causal\nmechanisms [3]. This is akin to measuring intermediate\nendpoints in clinical trials to further understand the bio-\nlogical basis of any observed effects (for example, mea-\nsuring cholesterol alongside trials of lipid-lowering\ndrugs where the primary endpoint could be reduction in\nvascular related deaths). Different theories will be rele-\nvant to interventions at different levels; for example,\npsychological theories will likely be more relevant to\ninterventions directed at individuals and teams, while\ntheories of organisational change will be more relevant\nto interventions directed at hospitals or other large\norganisations.\nWe undertook a randomised controlled trial (RCT) [4]\nusing a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design to evaluate the effects of\nfeedback of requesting rates enhanced with educational\nmessages, and brief educational reminder messages,\nalone and in combination on UK primary care doctors\u2019\nrequesting of nine potentially overused laboratory tests.\nPractices that received either or both the enhanced feed-\nback and the reminder messages were significantly less\nlikely than the control group to request the targeted\ntests in total. The effect of the interventions varied\nacross the targeted tests individually, although the gen-\neral pattern showed a reduction in the number of tests\nrequested for both interventions. Neither intervention\nwas consistently better than the other. To investigate\npossible causal mechanisms, we conducted a post inter-\nvention survey using the theory of planned behaviour\n(TPB) about the use of three of the targeted laboratory\ntests \u2013 the measurement of serum ferritin in the assess-\nment of microcytic anaemia (ferritin), the measurement\nof serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the\nassessment of menopausal status, and the measurement\nof Helicobacter Pylori serology (HPS) following eradica-\ntion therapy. Therefore, the aim of the study was to\nundertake a theory-based process evaluation study to\nexplore whether the cognitions of general practitioners\npredicted their test requesting behaviours and secondly,\nwhether the trial results were mediated by the theoreti-\ncal constructs.\nMethods\nDescription of the main trial interventions\nFeedback consisted of a six-sided colour booklet (e.g.,\nsee Additional File 1) presenting graphs of practice level\ndata for each of the nine targeted tests and for each\nlaboratory discipline as a whole. Every graph showed\nrates of test requesting over the previous three years for\nthe practice compared with the regional rates. The feed-\nback was enhanced with brief educational messages that\ndescribed specific clinical circumstances where it was\ninappropriate to request the test. These messages were\nincluded alongside the graphs for each of the targeted\ntests. The booklets were posted to each primary care\ndoctor within each intervention group practice on four\noccasions (updated every three months from the start of\nthe intervention period).\nThe brief educational messages were added as remin-\nders to the test result reports sent to the requesting\npractice (e.g., see Additional File 2). The laboratory\ninformation system was programmed to recognise the\nrelevant cues for each of the targeted tests and automa-\ntically add the brief educational reminder messages to\nthe relevant printed and electronic test result reports.\nThe messages were activated every time the cue\noccurred and were presented at the same time as the\ntest result. The reminder messages were intended to\ninfluence future requests for the targeted tests.\nChoice of theory\nThe process evaluation was based upon TPB (Figure 1)\n[5,6]. TPB is the social cognition model that has been\nwidely used to predict individual behaviours [7,8] and\nhas been one of the theories used most often when\nexploring the determinants of professional behaviour\n[9]. The theory states that an individual\u2019s intention to\nperform a behaviour is the proximal predictor of beha-\nviour. In turn, intention is predicted by attitude (a per-\nson\u2019s overall evaluation of the behaviour), subjective\nnorm (a person\u2019s own estimate of the social pressure to\nperform or not perform the target behaviour), and per-\nceived behavioural control (the extent to which a person\nFigure 1 The Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991).\nRamsay et al.

Perceived behavioural con-\ntrol also has a direct effect on behaviour.\nStudy design and population\nThe process evaluation comprised a cross-sectional\nquestionnaire survey of a random 50% sample of the\nrandomised groups of primary care doctors in Grampian\n(NHS Grampian), UK, who took part in a trial of the\neffect of enhanced feedback and brief educational\nreminders on test requesting behaviour. The random\nsampling was performed by a statistician independent of\nthe research team.\nWe focussed the process evaluation on three of the\ntest-requesting behaviours that were targeted in the trial\n\u2013 serum ferritin, FSH, and HPS \u2013 to reflect the varying\neffectiveness of the interventions. The choice of these\ntests reflected a range of effectiveness of the interven-\ntion. Whilst they were requested at similar rates prior to\nthe intervention, following the intervention there were\nstatistically significant reductions in the requesting of\nFSH, non-statistically significant reductions in Ferritin\nrequesting and HPS requesting was unaffected.\nData collection\nMeasures of the determinants of behaviour\nWe developed a direct measure TPB questionnaire to\nmeasure the determinants of the primary care doctors\u2019\ntest requesting behaviour [10]. We used standard\nworded items for each of four TPB constructs; intention,\nattitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural\ncontrol, with three to five items contributing to each\nconstruct. The questionnaire was in three sections each\ncorresponding to one of the three tests. At the start of\neach section, a brief scenario described the clinical pro-\nblem that had been targeted by the brief educational\nmessages. Primary care doctors were then asked to rate\ntheir intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived\nbehavioural control related to requesting a specific test\nin the described scenario on a 7-point Likert scale (ran-\nging from 1 \u2018strongly agree\u2019 to 7 \u2018strongly disagree\u2019). The\nscenarios and examples of items (questions) for each\nconstruct are detailed in Table 1, and a full copy of the\nquestionnaire can be seen in Additional File 3.\nThe survey took place 12 months after the initiation\nof the interventions. A questionnaire plus reply paid\nenvelope was posted to each primary care doctor, with\none reminder sent to non-responders two weeks later.\nMeasures of behaviour\nFor each of the targeted test, the test requesting rate per\n1,000 patients (standardised by practice list size) at 12\nmonths post-intervention was used as the measure of\nbehaviour in each primary care practice. The numbers\nof the three tests requested and the requesting practices\nfor the 12 months of the intervention period were\ndownloaded from the NHS Grampian laboratory infor-\nmation system. This data are routinely collected and\nascribed to the primary care practice and could not\naccurately be attributed to individual primary care\ndoctors.\nStatistical analysis\nIn all statistical analyses, the three targeted tests are\nreported and analysed separately. In order to test the\nrepresentativeness of our sample from within the trial\npractices, the mean difference in test-requesting beha-\nviour between sampled and non-sampled primary care\npractices was compared using a t-test.\nTable 1 Scenario details and examples of questionnaire items by construct\nScenarios\nFSH: Next week a woman aged 47 presents with hot flushes and night sweats having missed three of her last six periods (menopausal\nsymptoms).\nHelicobacter pylori serology: Next week a patient comes to see you with symptoms of dyspepsia.

Implementation Science 2010, 5:71\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/71\nPage 3 of 9\nScale generation\nOn the assumption that the tests were not necessary,\nresponses for each of the four constructs were scaled\nfrom one to seven so that a high score on every con-\nstruct (e.g. 7) equated with a low intention to request a\ntest, a negative attitude towards requesting a test, a low\nperception of social pressure to request a test, and a\nhigh control over whether or not tests were requested.\nFor every primary care doctor, a score for each con-\nstruct in the TPB model was calculated as the mean of\nall items contributing to the construct. Cronbach\u2019s alpha\nwas used to ascertain the reliability of each of the scales.\nIf reliability was lower than 0.7, an exploratory factor\nanalysis was performed to identify any unreliable items\nand unreliable items were removed from the scale.\nScale summaries\nGeneral descriptive statistics were used to summarise\neach scale and an intra-cluster correlation [11] was esti-\nmated to describe the degree of clustering of cognitions\nwithin each primary care practice. Pearson correlations\nwere produced between all the scales. Multiple linear\nregressions of intention on attitude, subjective norm and\nperceived behavioural control were performed to iden-\ntify significant predictors (2P < 0.05). To correct for the\nclustering within practice in the multiple regression\nmodels, the Huber-White estimator of variance inflation\nwas used [12].\nPredicting test requesting using intention\nTo predict the strength of the relationship between\nintention and behaviour, because the behaviour data\nwere at a practice level, a summary measure of intention\nfor each practice had to be calculated. This was gener-\nated in two ways \u2013 by taking the mean intention per\npractice (i.e., the average intention of all primary care\ndoctors within a practice), and by taking the minimum\nintention per practice (i.e., the lowest intention score\nfrom any respondent within a practice). The minimum\nrepresented the lowest intention in each practice to do\nthe correct behaviour (not request a test). The mini-\nmum was proposed as a possible summary measure\nbecause the severe negative skewness of the intention\nmeasures suggested that the poorest intention to per-\nform the behaviour might be a better correlation with\nactual practice performance. Linear regressions were\nperformed of behaviour on mean (or minimum) inten-\ntion. For all analyses, effects were reported with corre-\nsponding 95% confidence intervals and the R2 statistics\nwere reported.\nMediation analysis of trial result using intention\nSummary descriptives of each TPB construct together\nwith the behavioural outcome (test request rate per\n1,000) were tabulated by randomised group. To estimate\nthe strength of the mediation of intention on test\nrequesting behaviour, a simple mediation model was\nsetup with the trial group (reminders versus no remin-\nders) as the predictor of behaviour and intention as the\nmediator (see Figure 2 Mediation Model). A bootstrap-\nping method of estimating the indirect effect of inten-\ntion was used [13], and the estimated percentage of the\neffect mediated through intention was reported. The\nsame model was run for feedback versus no feedback.\nResults\nThe survey sample\nThe questionnaire was sent to 232 primary care doctors\nin 43 practices. One hundred and thirty-one primary\ncare doctors (56%) responded from 42 practices (33 pri-\nmary care doctors from 10 control practices, 32 from 11\nfeedback practices, 31 from 10 reminders practices and\n35 from 11 practices receiving both interventions). The\nmean requesting rate per 1,000 patients for each tar-\ngeted test was similar in sampled and non-sampled\npractices (ferritin: 11.9 versus 15.8, p = 0.152; FSH: 10.1\nversus 11.2, p = 0.474; HPS: 11.5 versus 11.5, p = 0.975).\nTPB constructs\nThe reliabilities of the behavioural intention, attitude,\nand subjective norm scales were greater than 0.70\n(Table 2). For perceived behavioural control, exploratory\nfactor analysis demonstrated that one question (how\nlikely is it you would be able to request a ferritin\/FSH\/\nHPS in this patient?) was poorly correlated with the\nother items on the scale thereby reducing the reliability.\nWhen this item was removed, the reliabilities improved\nto the values shown in Table 2.\nFigure 2 Mediation Model - Intervention group as the\npredictor of behaviour, intention as the mediator. The direct\neffect of the intervention allocation on behaviour is the coefficient\nC in the path diagram above. The indirect effect (often called the\nmediated effect) hypothesises that the observed intervention effect\nis due to a causal relationship whereby the intervention allocation\n\u201ccauses\u201d the mediator variable (intention) to change and that in\nturn \u201ccauses\u201d the behaviour to change. The indirect effect is\ntherefore the product of the coefficients A and B in the statistical\nmodel and the direct effect is C. The strength of the mediation is\ndetermined by the difference between the direct minus indirect\neffect.\nRamsay et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:71\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/71\nPage 4 of 9\nSummary statistics for each construct are shown in\nTable 2. Behavioural intention, attitudes, and subjective\nnorms were at similar levels within ferritin test request-\ning (medians approximately equal to four) and similar\nwithin FSH test requesting (medians approximately\nequal to five). Perceived behavioural control had a med-\nian >6.0 for both ferritin and FSH test requesting. For\nHPS test requesting, all scales had median >6.0 suggest-\ning a potential ceiling effect. Most of the intra-cluster\ncorrelations were >0.1, suggesting that primary care doc-\ntors had more similar cognitions to those in their own\npractice than to primary care doctors in other practices.\nBehavioural intention, attitude, and subjective norm\nwere highly correlated for all the tests (Table 3). There\nwas no evidence that perceived behavioural control was\ncorrelated with any of the other measures. Multiple lin-\near regression analyses demonstrated that attitude and\nsubjective norm were predictive of intention for ferritin,\nFSH, and HPS requesting (Table 4). Perceived beha-\nvioural control was statistically significant for only the\nHPS requesting, but the R2 for that model was lower\nthan the others and intention had a clear ceiling effect\nsuggesting the model fit was suboptimal and therefore\nunreliable.\nPredicting the rate of test requests\nSimple linear regression analysis of the rate of test\nrequests on mean behavioural intentions had R2 of 8.5%,\n7.7% and 0.1% for ferritin, FSH, and HPS, respectively\nTable 4).

For HPS requesting, all\nTPB constructs were skewed towards the positive end of\nthe scales, suggesting very little variation between\nresponses.\nThe results of the mediation analysis are shown in\nTable 6. The direct result was the trial effect (i.e., the\ndifference in mean test requesting between the interven-\ntion and control groups). For example, reminders\nreduced the rate of ferritin test requesting by 1.33. Note\nin contrast to the main trial, none of the direct results\nwere statistically significant because only 50% of prac-\ntices were in the process evaluation. The indirect effect\nwas the difference in trial effect of the intervention\nwhen behavioural intention was included and excluded\nfrom the model. For example, behavioural intention\nreduced the effect of reminders on ferritin tests by 0.39,\nresulting in 29% of the effect of the reminders being\nmediated through intention. For ferritin and FSH, there\nwas some evidence that the trial effects were partially\nmediated by behavioural intentions. For HPS test\nrequesting, there was a clear ceiling effect in behavioural\nintention making the mediation analysis unreliable.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated that TPB can be used as a tool\nfor theory-based process evaluations with the aim of\ninvestigating possible causal mechanisms in KT inter-\nvention studies when the intervention is hypothesised to\nTable 4 Predictors of behavioural intentions and\nbehaviour using multiple regression\nCoefficent* (95% CI) p-value R2\nPredictors of intentions\nFerritin 86%\nAttitude 0.91(0.80, 1.02) < 0.001\nSubjective norm 0.29 (0.11, 0.48) < 0.01\nPerceived behavioural control -0.08(-0.19, 0.04) 0.203\nFSH 86%\nAttitude 0.94 (0.81, 1.06) < 0.001\nSubjective norm 0.33 (0.14, 0.51) < 0.01\nPerceived behavioural control 0.12 (-0.05, 0.28) 0.156\nHPS 65%\nAttitude 0.46 (0.10, 0.81) 0.013\nSubjective norm 0.41 (0.12, 0.71) 0.008\nPerceived behavioural control -0.10 (-.20, -.00) 0.048\nPredictor of behaviour\nFerritin\nIntentions -1.78 (-3.59, 0.03) 0.061 8.5%\nFSH\nIntentions -0.82 (-1.70, 0.06) 0.075 7.7%\nHPS\nIntentions 0.28 (-1.98, 2.54) 0.808 0.1%\n* Coefficient interpreted as the change in intentions (or behaviour) for each\nunit change in the construct (predictor)\nTable 5 Summary of scales and behaviour by trial allocation\nBehavioural\nIntention\nPerceived\nBehavioural\nControl\nSubjective Norm Attitude Rate per 1000\ntest requests\nMedian (IQR) Median (IQR) Median (IQR) Median (IQR) Mean (sd)\nTest Requested:\nFerritin\nControl group 2.7 (2.0, 4.3) 6.3 (5.8, 7.0) 4.3 (3.5, 5.0) 3.25 (2.0, 4.0) 13.4 (6.7)\nFeedback only group 4.3 (3.0, 6.0) 6.0 (5.3, 7.0) 5.0 (3.9, 5.8) 4.5 (3.6, 5.6) 11.8 (5.3)\nReminders only group 4.0 (2.1, 6.0) 7.0 (6.0, 7.0) 5.0 (4.0, 6.0) 4.0 (2.3, 5.2) 15.2 (14.6)\nBoth group 5.0 (2.9, 6.0) 6.3 (5.5, 7.0) 6.4 (5.8, 7.0) 4.5 (3.0, 5.3) 7.6 (3.6)\nFSH\nControl group 4.3 (2.7, 6.0) 6.0 (5.8, 6.8) 4.2 (3.5, 5.2) 4.2 (3.2, 5.5) 11.3 (3.9)\nFeedback only group 5.6 (4.3, 6.0) 6.5 (5.5, 7.0) 4.9 (4.2, 5.5) 5.2 (4.5, 6.0) 10.1 (2.7)\nReminders only group 6.0 (5.0, 7.0) 6.5 (6.0, 6.9) 5.2 (3.9, 5.9) 5.5 (4.7, 6.2) 9.6 (3.9)\nBoth group 6.0 (5.0, 7.0) 6.3 (5.5, 7.0) 5.2 (4.7, 5.9) 5.7 (4.9, 6.1) 9.5 (4.0)\nHPS\nControl group 6.3 (6.0, 7.0) 5.8 (4.9, 6.5) 6.0 (5.5, 7.0) 7.0 (5.7, 7.0) 10.7 (4.9)\nFeedback only group 7.0 (6.0, 7.0) 5.8 (5.0, 7.0) 6.0 (5.5, 6.0) 7.0 (6.0, 7.0) 13.6 (6.8)\nReminders only group 7.0 (6.0, 7.0) 6.8 (6.0, 7.0) 6.2 (5.0, 6.9) 7.0 (6.0, 7.0) 10.7 (4.6)\nBoth group 7.0 (7.0, 7.0) 6.0 (5.5, 7.0) 6.3 (5.8, 7.0) 7.0 (6.0, 7.0) 10.9 (5.9)\nPBC = Perceived Behavioural Control\nRamsay et al.

There were dif-\nferences in intention, attitude, and subjective norm to\nFSH and ferritin test requesting, suggesting that the\nintervention may have enhanced attitudes and subjective\nnorms resulting in higher intention and subsequent\nbehaviour changes. Indeed, mediational analysis was\nhighly suggestive that the differences in test requesting\nbehaviour between trial groups were mediated through\nintention. There were high intentions, subjective norms,\nand attitudes for HPS requesting, suggesting that there\nmay have been a psychological ceiling effect resulting in\nthe observed lack of effect on test requesting behaviour\nin the trial.\nThis study had several strengths. First, the main trial\ndemonstrated strong intervention effects (behaviour\nchange), so provided an ideal platform to investigate\nwhy change did or did not occur. In particular, the ran-\ndomisation element provided the opportunity to\nrobustly investigate whether intentions mediated the\ntrial result. Second, use of a well-established psychologi-\ncal model (TPB) enabled the psychological constructs to\nbe clearly defined. Third, the derived measures of psy-\nchological constructs were sensitive to group allocation,\nsuggesting that the constructs were identifying real dif-\nferences. Finally, the TPB survey was returned com-\npleted from 42 of the 43 practices, suggesting that the\nresults were generalisable.\nThe mediational analysis suggested that intentions to\nrequest an FSH or ferritin test were part of the causal\npathway in the trial, i.e., the observed trial reduction in\ntest requesting was partially mediated by a change in\nintentions. In our experience, formal mediational ana-\nlyses have been rarely used to investigate the causal fac-\ntors in KT randomised trials, and we suggest\ninvestigators should make more use of theory-based\nprocess evaluations.\nGiven that responses were received from several pri-\nmary care doctors within a practice, we were able to\ndemonstrate that there was clustering of psychological\nconstructs within practices. Behavioural intentions and\nattitudes to test requesting had intra-cluster correlations\ngreater than 0.1. This clustering provided some empiri-\ncal evidence that social or organisational factors within\npractices may influence test-requesting behaviour. The\nclustering also needs to be considered from a statistical\npower perspective when conducting such surveys in the\nfuture. The effects of clustering are that precision is\nreduced and confidence intervals are wider than if clus-\ntering were not present. The surveys therefore need a\nlarger sample size to attain the level of precision that\ninvestigators are interested in [14].\nWhilst nearly all practices (42\/43) were represented in\nthe final survey, only 56% of the primary care doctors\nwithin those practices responded. This response rate\nfrom individual primary care doctors is very similar to\nthat of other surveys of health professionals [15]. We\ncannot however be sure that the responders\u2019 views are\nrepresentative of the practice, but the response rates\nwere the same across the trial intervention groups sug-\ngesting that the results were not biased. Further, use of\ndifferent measures of aggregated practice intention acted\nas a form of sensitivity analysis on the influence of dif-\nferent aggregation methods on the study results [16].\nIn this study, our behavioural outcome was practice\nlevel test requesting. Ideally, to operationalise TPB\nmodel faithfully, the outcome would be individual prac-\ntitioner-level requesting. A multi-level model analysis\ncould then be used to account for any clustering of\nbehaviour or behavioural predictors by practice. How-\never, it was not possible to obtain data on individual pri-\nmary care doctors\u2019 requesting patterns from the\nadministrative data systems. The implication for statisti-\ncal analysis was that some measure of practice-level psy-\nchological cognitions had to be derived. An obvious\nsummary measure is the mean cognition of the primary\ncare doctors within each practice [16]. Using the mean\ncognition, intentions predicted about 8% of the variabil-\nity in FSH and ferritin testing. Because the psychological\nTable 6 Mediational analysis of intentions on trial result\nFerritin FSH HPS\nMean (95% CI) Mean (95% CI) Mean (95% CI)\nMain effect:\nReminders\nDirect effect -1.33 (-6.78, 4.11) -1.11 (-3.35, 1.12) -1.37 (-4.87, 2.13)\nIndirect effect -0.39 (-2.70, 1.22) -0.86 (-2.53, 0.19) 0.21 (-.44, 1.47)\nPercentage effect mediated by intentions 29% 77% 0%\nEnhanced Feedback\nDirect effect -4.57 (-9.85, 0.70) -0.66 (-2.91, 1.60) 1.55 (-1.94, 5.05)\nIndirect effect -1.31 (-3.66, 0.16) -0.15 (-1.19, 0.50) -0.10 (-1.44, 0.83)\nPercentage effect mediated by intentions 28% 23% 0%\nRamsay et al.

The minimum predicted about 12% of the\nvariability in FSH and ferritin testing. The observed lack\nof relationship between HPS testing behaviour and\nintentions to request was likely due to the ceiling effect\nin intentions, but could also be due to the insensitivity\nin the behavioural measure. That is, whilst the interven-\ntion (and therefore the scenario description in the ques-\ntionnaire) targeted requesting of the tests in specific\nclinical circumstances, the information system cannot\ndistinguish between specific clinical circumstances (e.g.,\nfor HPS repeat testing after eradication therapy, the\nmeasure of behaviour was all HPS test requests because\nthe information system cannot distinguish between\ninitial tests, repeat-tests, and does not identify the rea-\nsons for the request). Therefore, our dependent variable\nmay not exactly match the context of the intervention\nand scenario. Our findings and future investigations of\ncausal mechanism would be strengthened by individual,\ncontext specific, measures of behaviour. We would\nrecommend that researchers consider conducting a sen-\nsitivity analysis on any summary measure of psychologi-\ncal cognitions when attempting to describe a group level\nbehaviour [16]\nNo formal statistical power calculation was performed\nfor the survey. The confidence intervals for the testing\nof the constructs that were predictive of intentions\n(Table 3) and the models predicting behaviour-using\nintentions (Table 4) demonstrated the study was ade-\nquately powered to detect important effects. For the\nresults of the mediational analysis the study was under-\npowered. This was due mainly to only 50% of the origi-\nnal study practices taking part in the survey. This meant\nthat the original study findings on test-requesting beha-\nviour could not be replicated with the same precision\n(though the magnitude of effects were similar). We\nwould recommend that future studies of mediational\nfactors in KT trials conduct a formal sample size to\nensure adequate power for the theory based process\nevaluation.\nWe investigated behavioural predictors at one time\npoint after initiation of the intervention i.e., the survey\nwas conducted after the study interventions had been\ndelivered for 12 months. In this example, the difference\nin constructs scores between intervention and control\npractices were large and provided evidence of changes\nin construct. Future process evaluations may be aug-\nmented by the addition of pre-intervention measures of\nbehavioural predictors. Furthermore, the results of this\nstudy provide some evidence that TPB could be used to\ndesign an intervention. The ceiling effect on the inten-\ntion to request HPS tests suggests that an intervention\ntargeting a primary care doctors\u2019 intention to request\nthe test would likely fail. In the context of the trial\nreported here, this would have suggested that feedback\nand reminders might not have been effective interven-\ntions to use and that was indeed the trial finding.\nThe aims of process evaluation alongside randomised\ntrials of complex interventions are numerous (e.g., fide-\nlity of implementation; mechanisms, mediators, and the\nprocess of change; acceptability) and often encompass a\nrange of methods [17-19]. There are few RCTs of pro-\nfessional behaviour change strategies that utilise theory\nto investigate the process of change [20]. Whilst TPB\nseems to be the most commonly applied social cognition\nmodel for investigating health professional behaviour,\nfew studies have attempted to predict clinical-related\nbehaviour [9]. The results of this process evaluation uti-\nlising theory, re-enforces that TPB seem an appropriate\ntheory to predict health professional behaviour change\n[9], and that it may offer useful insight into the pro-\ncesses underlying change (trial effects) in KT trials [17].\nSummary\nRecognition of the KT gap has led to increased interest\nin more active KT strategies. Existing research demon-\nstrates that professional behaviour change interventions\ncan be effective, but the effectiveness of interventions\nappears to vary across different clinical problems, con-\ntexts, and organisations. This study demonstrated that a\ntheory-based process evaluation can provide useful\ninformation on causal mechanisms that aid not only\ninterpretation of the trial but also can inform future\nevaluations and intervention development. We encou-\nrage researchers to conduct and further develop meth-\nods for exploring causal mechanisms alongside rigorous\nevaluations of different strategies.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Example of the feedback intervention.\nAdditional file 2: Example of the reminders intervention.\nAdditional file 3: The TPB questionnaire.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Anne Walker for contributing to the design of the questionnaires.\nThe Health Services Research Unit is funded by the Chief Scientist Office of\nthe Scottish Government Health Directorate.
