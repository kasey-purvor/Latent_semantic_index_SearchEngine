Murray Lark2 & Guy J.D.\nKirk1*\n1National Soil Resources Institute, Cranfield University, Silsoe, MK45 4DT, UK\n2Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, AL5 2JQ, UK\nMost terrestrial carbon is held in soils, more than twice as much as in vegetation or\nthe atmosphere1, and changes in soil carbon content can have a large effect on the\nglobal carbon budget. The possibility that climate change is being reinforced by\nincreased carbon dioxide emissions from soils with rising temperature is the\nsubject of a continuing debate2\uf02d9. But to date evidence for the suggested feedback\nmechanism has come solely from small-scale laboratory and field experiments and\nmodelling studies2\uf02d9. Here we use data from the National Soil Inventory of England\nand Wales obtained between 1978 and 2003 to show that carbon was lost from soils\nacross England and Wales over the survey period at a mean rate of 0.6 per cent\nper year (relative to the existing soil carbon content). We find that the relative rate\nof carbon loss increased with soil carbon content and was more than two per cent\nper year in soils with carbon contents greater than 100 grams per kilogram. The\nrelationship between rate of loss and carbon content held across the whole country\nand across all forms of land use suggesting a link to climate change. Our findings\nindicate that losses of soil carbon in England and Wales, and by inference other\ntemperate regions, are likely to have been offsetting absorption of carbon by\nterrestrial sinks.\nThe National Soil Inventory was made to obtain an unbiased estimate of the\ndistribution of the soils of England and Wales and of the chemistry of the topsoil (0\uf02d15\ncm)10. Samples were collected and soil profiles described at the intersections of an\northogonal 5-km grid over the whole area (Methods). This yielded about 6,000 sites of\nwhich 5,662 could be sampled for soil. Figure 1a shows the distribution of soil organic\ncarbon contents across England and Wales measured in the original sampling\n(1978\uf02d83). Sufficient sub-sets of the sites were re-sampled at intervals from 12 to 25\nyears after the original sampling to be able to detect changes in carbon content with\n95% confidence (Methods). This was done in three phases: in 1994\/95 for arable and\nrotational grassland sites (853 of the original 2,578 sites), in 1995\/96 for managed\npermanent grassland sites (771 of the original 1,579), and in 2003 for non-agricultural\nsites (bogs, scrub, rough grazing, woodland, etc; 555 of the original 1,505). Roughly\n40% of the original sites were re-sampled. This is the only soil inventory on such a scale\nanywhere in the world to have been re-sampled. To allow for the varying time interval\nbetween samplings, annual rates of change in carbon were calculated for each site by\n2assuming that the process of change was linear over the sampling interval. An analysis\nof known rates of change in soil carbon under different conditions showed this to be\nreasonable.\nFigure 2 summarises the results grouped by soil type and land use. Some\ndifferences between soils and land uses are apparent: for example, peat soils lost carbon\nan order of magnitude faster than brown soils and man-made soils, and bogs and upland\ngrass lost carbon an order of magnitude faster than lowland heath, which appears to\nhave gained carbon on average. But we found no statistically significant relations\nbetween rate of change and land use, rainfall class or soil textural class, whether for the\ndata as a whole or for outlying data. However, we found a significant negative linear\ncorrelation between rate of change and original organic carbon content (Corg), i.e. the\nrate of loss increased with Corg (Fig. 3). The relation applied for the data as a whole and\nfor the three main land use groupings separately, though with different slopes and\nintercepts. We took a random sub-sample of 1000 observations from the data as a whole\nand obtained the following relation by linear regression specifying an exponential\nvariogram for the residuals (Methods):\nRate of change in Corg (g kg-1 yr-1) = 0.6 \u2013 0.0187 \u00d7 original Corg (g kg-1) (1)\n(standard error of intercept = 0.148 and of slope = 0.00081). The residuals from this\nregression applied to the whole data set show some regional features, notably a\ntendency to overestimate the rate of loss in uplands in the north-west and south-west of\nEngland. But only 8% of the unexplained variation is spatially structured, so a more\nsophisticated statistical model is unjustified. Figure 1b shows the distribution of rates of\nchange across England and Wales for all the sites, with values for the sites that were not\nre-sampled obtained using Equation (1).\nFrom the data in Fig. 3, the relative rates of change (rate of change \/ mean Corg\nover-sampling interval) were 1.43, 0.14, -0.69, -1.84, -2.71, -3.01 and -2.35% yr-1 for\noriginal Corg ranges 0\uf02d20 , 20\uf02d30, 30\uf02d50, 50\uf02d100, 100\uf02d200, 200\uf02d300 and > 300 g kg-1,\nrespectively. Hence the relative rates of loss also tended to increase with Corg, though\nnot above 300 g kg-1. Soils with Corg < 50 g kg-1 did not lose significant amounts of\ncarbon (i.e. not detectable over 10 yr), and those with Corg < 20 g kg-1 appear to have\ngained it. However, for soils with Corg > 100 g kg-1 relative rates of loss over the survey\nperiod were > 2% yr-1. Given that the bulk of the UK\u2019s carbon stocks are in organic\nsoils12, this is an alarming result.\nTable 1 gives estimates of the total changes in carbon in the upper 15 cm of soil for\nthe whole of England and Wales, with rates for the sites that were not re-sampled\npredicted using Equation (1). The total amount in the upper 15 cm at the time of the\noriginal sampling is estimated to be 864 Tg and the total rate of change in this depth is -\n4.44 Tg yr-1. From the distribution of soil types in the 1:250,000 National Soil Map\ninterpolated on a 1-km grid, Milne et al.11 estimate the total carbon stock of the soils of\nGreat Britain to be 2,458 Tg over 0\uf02d30 cm depth (1,404 Tg in England and Wales,\n1,153 Tg in Scotland). If the rate of change found here also applies to the soils of\nScotland (but note that most soils in Scotland have large organic carbon contents12, and\ntherefore the true rate of loss is likely to be larger), and if the rate of change over 0\uf02d30\ncm depth is the same as over 0\uf02d15 cm, then pro rata the total rate of loss across Great\nBritain is 12.5 Tg yr-1. For comparison, the UK\u2019s current industrial CO2 emission is\nabout 150 Tg yr-1.\n3We cannot with the existing data say where the missing carbon has gone. Some\nproportion will have been emitted to the atmosphere as CO2; some will have been\nleached to deeper soil layers and to drainage waters and beyond. The latter would be\nconsistent with the observed increases in dissolved organic carbon in surface waters\nacross much of England and Wales over the past 40 years12,13.\nSoil carbon contents depend on rates of addition from plant growth versus rates of\nremoval in decomposition, leaching and other soil processes, and each of these is\nsensitive to changes in land use, climate and other variables14\uf02d17. Various changes in\nland use will have contributed to carbon losses from soils across England and Wales\nover the survey period, both under agricultural uses (drainage schemes, post-war\ngrassland conversion, increased stocking rates) and non-agricultural uses (afforestation\non wet soils, increased erosion, increased burning of upland vegetation). However we\ndo not have sufficient data at the scale of the National Soil Inventory to explore these\neffects.\nThe fact that the losses appear to be happening across the country irrespective of\nland use suggests a link to climate change. Over the survey period, the mean\ntemperature across England and Wales increased by about 0.5 oC and there were also\nchanges in rainfall distribution18. Climate change will affect soil carbon turnover\nthrough various processes. Increases in temperature will tend to increase rates of\norganic matter decomposition by soil microbes, though the magnitude of this effect and\ndifferences between soils are uncertain9. The effects of temperature will interact in a\ncomplicated way with changes in soil moisture brought about by changing rainfall and\nevapo-transpiration patterns, and changes in atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen deposition.\nIn freely-drained soils, warmer drier conditions may retard decomposition of organic\nmatter if lack of moisture limits soil microbes. But in wet anoxic soils, increased\noxygenation of the soil as evaporation increases the depth to the water table will greatly\nreinforce the increase in decomposition with increased temperature. Such effects may in\npart explain the increase in the relative rate of loss with soil carbon content because\nmore-organic soils tend to be wetter. Also consistent with this, more-organic soils\nnecessarily contain a greater proportion of slowly decaying organic matter, and the rate\nof turnover of this material appears to be more sensitive to temperature changes than\nthat of more-labile organic matter8. However the magnitudes of these effects are\nunknown.\nBased on atmospheric observations, net carbon absorption by terrestrial systems in\nthe northern hemisphere has increased in recent decades14. The magnitude of the carbon\nsink in different regions and the contributions of different processes are highly\nuncertain, but the main sinks are thought to be changes in land use and increased forest\ngrowth with increased atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen deposition. Our findings show that\nlosses of soil carbon in the UK and by inference other temperate regions are likely to\nhave been offsetting absorption by terrestrial sinks, greatly adding to the uncertainty of\nfuture trends.\nMethods\nOriginal sampling\nThe 5-km sampling grid was offset 1 km north and 1 km east of the origin of the\nNational Grid to avoid sampling at the edges of published maps. Urban areas and water\nbodies were avoided, but otherwise all soils were sampled. At each site 25 soil cores\nwere taken at 4-m intervals in a 20 m x 20 m square centred on the grid intersection19.\n4The cores were taken to a maximum depth of 15 cm from the surface using a 2.5-cm\ndiameter auger, with the soil surface taken as the zero of measurement, and excluding\nlitter layers and living vegetation. The cores were bulked in the field, giving a total of\napproximately 1 kg of moist material for each site. The samples were air-dried at\ntemperatures not exceeding 30oC, and each then divided into three equal portions. One\nportion was stored in a polythene bag inside a cardboard box at ambient temperature\nand humidity without further treatment. The other portions were crushed < 2 mm and\nsub-samples analysed for organic carbon as below.\nRe-sampling\nThe minimum proportions of the original sites to be re-sampled so as to detect changes\nin Corg with 95% confidence were calculated using the relation \uf028 \uf029211\n2\n1\n1\nszdnn\nn\n\uf061\uf02b\n\uf0b3\nwhere n1 and n2 are the sizes of the original and re-sampled populations, \u03b1 is the\nprobability that the change in mean Corg is greater than some small value d, z\uf061 is the\nprobability of the standardised Normal distribution of Corg being less than \u03b1, and s is the\nstandard deviation of the original population. The accuracy of the Corg measurement in\nthe laboratory (below) was \u00b1 1 g kg-1 and hence the minimum value of d is 2 g kg-1.\nThis value was used for the arable\/rotational grass and permanent grass sites. For the\nnon-agricultural sites, the standard deviation of Corg was greater, particularly for more-\norganic soils. Accordingly for these sites sampling was designed with d = 2 g kg-1 for\nsoils with Corg < 150 g kg-1, d = 5 g kg-1 for Corg = 150\uf02d300 g kg-1 and d = 10 g kg-1 for\nCorg > 300 g kg-1. Sites were selected at random from the original sites within these\ngroupings in proportion to the original regional sampling density, and sampled exactly\nas originally.\nTo test the accuracy with which the sites could be relocated, six surveyors were\ninstructed to re-visit 10 sites with widely differing characteristics following the\noriginally recorded site descriptions, their positions recorded with a global positioning\nsystem, and the distances between them subsequently measured. This showed the\naccuracy of re-location was better than 20 m on enclosed land and better than 50 m on\nopen land, and values of Corg at 0, 20 and 50 m from the target measured using the\noriginal methods were not significantly different from each other (Supplementary Fig.\n1). Hand-written field records from the original sampling were examined to see if\noutliers in the data (based on the log normalised changes in Corg) had any common\nfeatures. No artefacts were found that would have led us to believe the outliers were not\ntrue representations of the changes.\nOrganic carbon analysis\nExactly the same methods were used for the two samplings. Soils with Corg < approx.\n150 g kg-1 were analysed by a modified Walkley-Black method20. The small sub-\nsamples this uses are unrepresentative of highly organic soils, so soils with Corg >\napprox. 150 g kg-1 were analysed by loss on ignition (LOI)21, converted to Corg by Corg =\n0.5 \u00d7 LOI. To check that the change of method introduced no artefacts, we applied both\nto 95 soils with Corg = 20\uf02d200 g kg-1 and obtained good agreement and no systematic\ndeviation (Supplementary Fig. 2). To check for differences in analytical precision\nbetween the samplings, we re-analysed stored samples from 10% of the original sites\nand obtained good agreement with the original values across the full range of Corg\n(Supplementary Fig. 3).\n5Derivation of Equation (1)\nEquation (1) is a regression, but was not fitted by ordinary least squares because the\noriginal systematic sampling precludes the assumption that the residuals are\nindependent random variables22. The Equation (1) was fitted as a mixed model with a\nspatially-dependent random effect and a white noise term such that, for any pair of\nlocations xi and xj the expected squared difference of the residuals, \u03b7(xi) and \u03b7(xj), is\n\uf07b \uf07d\uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07dexp12)()(E 102 acc jiji xxxx \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\uf02d\uf068\uf068 where c0 and c1 are the variances\nof the white noise and spatially dependent components respectively and a is a distance\nparameter. The model was fitted by residual maximum likelihood23.\n______________________________________________________________________\n1. Batjes, N.H. Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world.
