Many \u201cflavours\u201d\nof QPO have been identified, with some correlations between their\nfrequencies (Psaltis, Belloni & van der Klis 1999). For example,\nlow frequency (f of a few Hz) QPO in black hole XRB seem to ap-\npear preferentially when the state of the source changes (Rutledge\net al. 1999). They are mostly observed in luminous states, high or\nvery high state, when the energy spectrum is rather complex, show-\ning both disc thermal component and high energy Comptonized\ncomponent (see QPO observations review in Wijnands 2001). Mod-\nels of QPO so far concentrated on identifying the frequencies of\noscillations, with very little if any attention paid to the fact that it is\nthe hard X\u2013rays which are modulated (see QPO models review in\nPsaltis 2001). The results of Gilfanov, Revnivtsev & Molkov (2003)\nand Revnivtsev & Gilfanov (2005) are perhaps the only ones where\nthe energy spectra of QPO are discussed and interpreted. These au-\nthors applied Fourier frequency resolved spectroscopy (Revnivtsev,\nGilfanov & Churazov 1999, 2001) to show in particular that the\nkilo-Hz QPO spectra in neutron star XRB are the same as spectra\nat other Fourier frequencies. This can be interpreted as common\nspatial origin of the X-rays showing the usual broad band noise\n\u22c6 E-mail:malsob@camk.edu.pl\n\u2020 Present address: University of Durham, Physics Department, South Road,\nDurham DH1 3LE, UK\n\u2021 E-mail:ptz@camk.edu.pl\nvariability and the more coherent quasi-periodic variability. The\nspectral shape of these components is consistent with Comptonized\nemission from a boundary layer.\nFourier spectroscopy techniques are particularly suitable for\nanalysis of QPO. However, the approach of Revnivtsev et al. (1999)\nrequires integrating the power density spectra over a narrow fre-\nquency interval around a chosen frequency resulting in contamina-\ntion of the Fourier frequency resolved spectrum of the QPO by a\ncontribution from the broad band variability component. Thus, in\nthis paper we construct a root-mean-square spectrum, where each\npoint is the r.m.s. variability integrated over the component (e.g. a\nLorentzian) describing the QPO in the broad band power spectrum.\nSuch energy dependences of QPO amplitude in XRB has been in-\nvestigated before (e.g. Belloni et al. 1997; Cui et al. 1999; Rao et al.\n2000; Tomsick & Kaaret 2001; Rodriguez et al. 2004; Casella et al.\n2004; see review in van der Klis 2006). The main conclusion from\nthese studies is that the QPO amplitude increases with energy up to\nat least \u223c 20 keV. This suggests immediately that the oscillations\nare connected with the high energy spectral component, rather than\nwith the disk component.\nThe significance of the r.m.s. energy spectrum is that it de-\nscribes the energy spectrum of the process responsible for a given\nvariability component (e.g. a QPO), if the variability is generated\nby fluctuactions of the normalization of a separate spectral compo-\nnent (Gilfanov et al. 2003; \u02d9Zycki & Sobolewska 2005, hereafter Pa-\nper I). If the QPO is produced by an additional modulation of one\nor more physical parameters determining the spectrum, its r.m.s.\nspectrum has less direct interpretation, but still it contains the sig-\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS\n2 M.A. Sobolewska and P.T. \u02d9Zycki\nTable 1.

Energy dependencies of r.m.s.\nspectra were investigated by many authors with a goal of determin-\ning how the spectral components vary with respect to each other.\nRecently, Gierlin\u00b4ski & Zdziarski (2005) investigated the r.m.s. en-\nergy spectra of a number of XRBs in various spectral stated and in-\nterpreted them in terms of variations of plasma heating\/cooling rate\nin a scenario where the time average energy spectrum consists of\na disc blackbody and a hybrid (thermal\/non-thermal) Comptoniza-\ntion. However, their r.m.s. spectra were averaged over all variability\ncomponents (Fourier frequency).\nIn this paper we perform a systematic study of energy de-\npendencies of low-frequency QPO in black hole XRB in different\nspectral states. We analyse RXTE data from a number of sources\nobserved at time periods close to or during state transitions, when\nthe sources showed QPO in 1\u201310 Hz range. We selected data with\ngood energy and time resolutions, enabling construction of power\ndensity spectra (PDS) in at least 12 energy channels covering the\n3\u201340 keV range. We then constructed the r.m.s. spectra of the QPO\nand compared them with the mean energy spectra. Finally, we com-\npared the results of data analysis with the predictions of theoretical\nmodels. The models themselves are described in detail in Paper I.\n2 DATA SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION OF\nTIME-AVERAGED SPECTRA\nWe made use of the RXTE archive data. We were particularly in-\nterested in observations during which a pronounced (rms > 10%)\nand coherent 1\u201310 Hz QPO were present in the power density spec-\ntrum. A basic criterion was good timing and spectral resolution of\nthe data. The log of all observations is presented in Table 1.\nWe extracted Standard 2 PCA spectra from top and mid layer\nfrom all available units. Standard selection criteria and dead time\ncorrection procedures were applied. The PCA background was es-\ntimated using the pcabackest package (ver. 3.0), while the response\nmatrices were made for each observation with pcarsp ver. 10.1\ntool. Systematic error of 0.5 per cent were added to each bin of\nPCA spectra, to take into account possible calibration uncertain-\nties. HEXTE data (Archive mode, Cluster 0) were extracted using\nthe same selection criteria as those for the PCA. Background was\nestimated using hxtback tool. For spectral modelling we used the\nPCA data in 3\u201320 keV range and HEXTE data 20\u2013200 keV range.\nThe spectral model consisted of a disc blackbody and ther-\nmal Comptonization components, modified by photoelectric ab-\nsorption. For Comptonization we use the THCOMP XSPEC model\n(Zdziarski, Johnson & Magdziarz 1996). This is parametrized by\nthe asymptotic spectral index, \u0393, seed photon temperature, T0, and\nelectron temperature, kTe. Disc blackbody (maximum) tempera-\nture is denoted Tbb. In most cases we assume T0 = Tbb as can\nbe expected, if it is the disc photons which are Comptonized, but\nwe will also consider cases where the temperatures are de-coupled.\nThe THCOMP model computes also self-consistently the repro-\ncessed component consisting of the Compton reflected continuum\nand the Fe fluorescent K\u03b1 line ( \u02d9Zycki, Done & Smith 1999 and\nreferences therein). The main parameters here are the relative am-\nplitude of the component, R, ionization parameter of the reproces-\nsor, \u03be, and the inner disc radius used for computing the smearing of\nspectral features due to relativistic effects, Rin.\nResults of the fits to the time averaged spectra are given in\nTable 2 and described in detail in following Sections.

Detailed timing anal-\nysis and identification of different types of QPO was presented in\nCasella et al. (2004). During the observations the source was in a\nvery high state. The data are well described with a disc blackbody\nmodel with a temperature of\u223c 0.7\u20130.8 keV and its thermal Comp-\ntonization on electrons with temperature fixed at kTe = 150 keV\n(lower temperature, kTe \u2248 40 keV is required for the first observa-\ntion). The Comptonized continuum has a photon index of \u0393 = 2.1\u2013\n2.4. In all datasets a weak (amplitude R = 0.1\u20130.2), highly ion-\nized (ionization parameter \u03be = 1200\u20132700) reflection component\nis present. All but the first observation require an additional smear-\ning, which we model as relativistic effects.\n2.2 GRS 1915+105\nWe analysed three observations of GRS 1915+105. This is a very\npeculiar source showing complicated variability patterns and com-\nplex spectra. It seems to be always in a high\/soft state, because of\nhigh accretion rate (Sobolewska & \u02d9Zycki 2003; Done, Wardzin\u00b4ski\n& Gierlin\u00b4ski 2004). The spectral analysis of the three characteristic\nspectral states of this source, introduced by Belloni et al. (2000),\nwas presented in Sobolewska & \u02d9Zycki (2003).\nThe spectrum from the first observation can be well modelled\nas a sum of disc blackbody and a thermal Comptonization compo-\nnent. In such a scenario, disc blackbody photons with a temperature\nof \u223c 0.6 keV provide seed photons for Comptonization on elec-\ntrons with kTe \u2248 40 keV. The continuum is modified by reflection\n(R \u2248 0.5) from a highly ionized medium (\u03be \u223c 104), with relativis-\ntic smearing. An additional gaussian line at 6.4 keV is also needed\nto fit the residua.\nThe same model does not describe well the two remaining\ndatasets. Large residua in soft energy band remain and the model\ncannot fit simultaneously the high energy tail (above 50 keV).\nWe try a two-Comptonization model and a model consisting of a\ndisc blackbody and two Comptonizations. While the three compo-\nnent models give fits of comparable or marginally better quality\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 69.5\/61 vs. 72.2\/62 and 44.1\/65 vs. 52.0\/66, for datasets\nII and III, respectively), the best fit values of the reflection ampli-\ntude are closer to 1 than for the two component models. We thus\nuse the three component models in our further studies. Disc pho-\ntons temperature is kTbb = 0.2\u20131 keV. Electron temperature in\nthe soft Comptonization component is 4\u20135 keV, while in the hard\nComptonization component it is 50\u2013150 keV. Best fit reflection am-\nplitudes are high, R = 1.3\u20131.7,although with quite high uncer-\ntainties, and the reflection is highly ionized, \u03be \u223c 104. Additional\nnarrow gaussian line at 6.4 keV of EW\u2248 50 eV is also required.\n2.3 XTE J1550-564\nXTE J1550-564 have been studied by many authors (e.g. Sobczak\net al. 2000; Wilson & Done 2001). We chose four observations from\nthe 1998 outburst (Cui et al. 1999; Kubota & Makishima 2004;\nKubota & Done 2004) and one observation from the 2000 outburst\n(Tomsick, Corbel & Kaaret 2001).\nDuring our first observation (obs. 8 in Cui et al. 1999) the\nsource already switched to a soft state. The spectrum cannot be de-\nscribed by a two-component continuum model (either a disc black-\nbody and a Comptonization, or a two Comptonization model). A\nthree component model provides a good fit: disc blackbody of\nTbb \u2248 0.6 keV and its Comptonization on cool (kTe \u2248 8 keV)\nand hot (kTe = 150 keV) electrons. The data require a somewhat\nbroadened, highly ionized (\u03be \u223c 103) reflection (R \u223c 0.4) and an\nadditional narrow iron line at 6.4 keV.\nOur next three observations are representative to the ,,anoma-\nlous\u201d very high state (Kubota & Makishima 2004; Kubota & Done\n2004), which the source entered after being in the standard very\nhigh state during the 1998\/1999 outburst.

Additional disc black-\nbody component is required only in the first anomalous state obser-\nvation (dataset II). The electron plasma temperatures are kTe = 5\u2013\n15 for the soft Comptonization and it was fixed at 150 keV for the\nhard Comptonization. The temperature of seed photons drops from\nkTbb = 0.9 to 0.5 keV. The data require a reflection component\nwhose strength also decreases (from R \u2248 2 to 0.2). The reflecting\nmedium is highly ionized (\u03be = 1300\u20134000), and the data required\nalso some relativistic smearing. The first and third datasets need a\nnarrow Gaussian line at 6.4 keV.\nOur last observation was taken during the 2000 outburst, when\nthe source was transiting to a hard state. This is observation 3 in\nKalemci et al. (2001) (timing analysis) and Tomsick et al. (2001)\n(spectral analysis). We found that the data can be very well de-\nscribed with a weak disc blackbody (kTbb \u223c 0.9 keV) and thermal\nComptonization (kTe = 150 keV). The photon index of the contin-\nuum is very hard, \u0393 \u223c 1.7. The data require a weak reflection com-\nponent (R \u2248 0.1) from an ionized medium (\u03be \u2248 1700), with sig-\nnificant smearing, corresponding to relativistic smearing with inner\ndisc radius of 8Rg). The residua at 6.4 keV are fit with additional\nnarrow gaussian line.\n2.4 4U 1630-47\nWe chose two observations of 4U 1630-47 from the beginning of\nthe 1998 outburst, when the source was still in a low\/hard state. A\ndetailed timing analysis of the outburst was performed in Dieters et\nal. (2000). In particular, a complex behaviour of QPO features dur-\ning the transition was analysed. According to Dieters et al. (2000)\nclassification, based on the power density properties, our observa-\ntions are an example of type A. We find that the energy spectra\nare well described by a model composed of a weak disc black-\nbody component with a relatively high soft photons temperature,\nkTbb \u223c 1, and its Comptonization on hot electrons. The contin-\nuum slope is \u0393 \u223c 1.9\u20132, intermediate between the hard slope of\nthe last dataset of XTE J1550-564 and the soft state slopes. The\ndata also require a weak reflection component (R \u2248 0.1) from an\nionized matter (\u03be = 2000\u20135000).\n3 QPO DATA ANALYSIS\n3.1 Light curves and power density spectra\nWe used binned and event mode PCA data for the high time resolu-\ntion spectral analysis. PCA configurations used for each dataset are\ngiven in Table 3. We generated light curves in each energy chan-\nnel using standard tools from the FTOOLS package. We used the\nbinned mode data in the range 3\u201313 keV and the event mode data\nabove 13 keV. We computed the power density spectra in the Leahy\nnormalization with the white noise subtracted in POWSPEC. Then,\nwe corrected each PDS for background and renormalized to the\nMiyamoto normalization (i.e., (r.m.s.\/mean)2), by multiplying by\nS+B\nS2\n, where S and B are source and background count rates, re-\nspectively (Berger & van der Klis 1994).\n3.2 QPO r.m.s. spectra\nWe modeled the PDS either as a broken power law continuum with\na Lorentz QPO profile, or as a sum of Lorentz profiles describing\nboth the continuum and the QPO (e.g. Nowak 2000). These are\nphenomenological descriptions, however, since a Lorentz function\nis a Fourier transform of a damped harmonic oscillator, it can be\nassumed (in particular in the latter case) that each Lorentzian in\nthe PDS is a signature of a quasi-periodic process with a different\ndegree of coherence. The QPO energy spectrum was then obtained\nby integrating the QPO Lorentzians over f for different energies.\nWe constructed response matrices for binned and event mode\ndata using pcarsp (the background correction was performed at\nthe stage of constructing PDS) and we fit the ff-spectra in XSPEC\nin order to quantify the spectral trends. We used data in a relatively\nwide energy range, \u223c 3\u201340 keV, but since the PCA data become\nbackground dominated above 20\u201330 keV, any residua and features\nat 20\u201340 keV should be treated and interpreted with caution.\n4 RESULTS\nHere we compare the energy dependent QPO r.m.s. spectra to the\ntime averaged spectra. The latter were described in earlier sections\non individual objects. The results are presented in the form of ra-\ntios of QPO data to the model components of the time averaged\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\nQPO X-ray spectra 5\nFigure 1.

These will be useful when we discuss the data in\nthe context of theoretical models in the next Section. We will also\nperform formal model fits to some of the QPO spectra in order to\nmore quantitatively determine their shape relative to the time aver-\naged spectra.\nOur sample contain 14 observations of four objects. Of these\n11 observations were performed in soft spectral states while 3 in\nthe hard state.\n4.1 Soft state spectra\nIn the soft state of XTE J1859+226 (Fig 1) the QPO spectra are\nmore similar to the Comptonized component than to the total spec-\ntra. This means that the disc blackbody component is not present\nin the QPO spectra, i.e. it does not participate in the oscillations.\nThe QPO spectra are harder than the Comptonized component in\nthe corresponding time averaged spectrum. Ratios for dataset (III)\nclearly indicate the presence of the reprocessed component in the\nQPO spectrum, which will be discussed in more details below.\nSimilarly, no disc blackbody component in the QPO spectra is\nobserved for GRS 1915+105 (Fig. 2). In all three spectra the QPO\ndata show larger deviations from the total model than from the (to-\ntal) Comptonized component. In datasets (II) and (III), where the\ntime averaged spectrum requires two Comptonized components,\nthe QPO are most similar to the sum of the two Comptonizations,\nrather than to either single one of them. In particular, the QPO spec-\ntra seem to be much harder than the soft Comptonization.\nWe attempt to fit the QPO data with a modified time averaged\nComptonization continuum. We first tie all the parameters of the\nQPO model, except for normalization, to the parameters of the time\naveraged spectrum. Fitting the GRS 1915+105 (I) dataset we also\nset the disc blackbody normalization to 0, so the only free param-\neter is the normalization of the Comptonized component. The fit is\nvery bad, \u03c72\u03bd = 267\/18 dof. It improves dramatically, when seed\nphoton temperature, T0, is free to adjust, \u03c72\u03bd = 42.3\/17 dof. The fit\nimproves further if the continuum slope is left free, \u03c72\u03bd = 35.8\/16.\nThe resulting model has higher T0 \u2248 0.95 keV compared to the\n\u2248 0.65 keV in the mean spectrum, and it is harder than the latter,\n\u0393 \u2248 2.18 compared to \u2248 2.25. The fit can be further improved if\nthe reflection amplitude is free to adjust, which will be discussed\nbelow.\nFor GRS 1915+105 datasets (II) and (III) there is a number\nof ways the time averaged Comptonized components can be mod-\nified to fit the QPO spectrum, since there are two Comptonized\ncomponents in each spectrum (in addition to the disc blackbody).\nLetting T0 (common to the two components) to be free does pro-\nvide a good fit, with the best fit value again higher than that in\nthe mean spectrum. When the seed photon temperature is fixed,\nT0, QPO = T0,mean, obtaining a fit of similarly good quality re-\nquires freeing at least three parameters: the two spectral slopes and\nelectron temperature of the soft Comptonization.\nIn the \u201canomalous\u201d VHS of XTE J1550-564 the QPO spectra\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n6 M.A. Sobolewska and P.T. \u02d9Zycki\nFigure 2.

The dashed (green online) curve is the soft Comptonization component. Ratios of the QPO data to: total continuum spectrum, total (two-component)\nComptonization, the soft Comptonization and the hard Comptonization, are plotted as labelled.\nare again harder than the time averaged spectra (Fig. 3). The disc\nblackbody component, even if present in the mean spectrum, is not\npresent in the QPO spectra. The QPO spectra slope above \u2248 7 keV\nis similar to that of the hard Comptonization slope in time aver-\naged spectrum, but there is a strong cutoff in QPO spectra below\nthat energy, which formally can be described as a high value of T0.\nWe therefore test a model, where the QPO spectrum is equal to the\nhard Comptonization component in the mean spectrum, but their\ncommon seed photon temperature is untied from the disc black-\nbody temperature or soft Comptonization seed photon temperature,\nT0,QPO = T0,hard 6= T0,soft = Tbb. Such a model gives some-\nwhat worse fits to the combined datasets than best models to time\naveraged data alone. Pairs of \u03c72\u03bd values for the mean spectrum fit\n(from Section 2) and for the combined mean spectrum and the QPO\nspectrum fits, are as follows: (65.8\/69 = 0.95, 90.8\/77 = 1.18),\n(51.3\/71 = 0.71, 65.6\/81 = 0.81) and (74.5\/73 = 1.02,\n85.1\/82 = 1.04), for dataset (II), (III) and (IV), respectively. For\ndatasets (III) and (IV) the increase of \u03c72 is 14.3 and 10.6 per 10\nand 9 new dof, respectively. Thus including the QPO data does not\nsignificantly worsens these fits. However, when the QPO fits are ex-\namined as data\/model ratios, they are approximately the same for\nall datasets. Its the larger error bars on datasets (III) and (IV) (com-\npared to dataset I) that make the fits acceptable. In particular the\ndata show pronounced low energy cutoffs below \u2248 6 keV, which is\nnot well modelled by the increased T0 if the latter is also to fit the\nmean spectrum. We thus conclude that the QPO data are unlikely\nto be described simply by the same shape as the hard Comptoniz-\ning continuum. This implies that more complicated models, which\ninclude spectral variability, must be employed to explain the QPO\nin these datasets. We intend to explore such models in more details\nin a future paper.\n4.2 Hard state spectra\nIn the hard spectral state of XTE J1550-564 (dataset V; Fig. 4), the\nQPO spectrum is somewhat softer than the total spectrum. When\nthe model for the time averaged spectrum is fitted to the QPO\ndata, the best fit model does contain the disc blackbody compo-\nnent (Tbb \u2248 0.89 keV). When the disc blackbody component is\nremoved and the seed photon temperature, T0, is fixed at Tbb, the\nfit is worse by \u2206\u03c72 = 7.2 for one more dof (\u03c72\u03bd = 13.1\/10 vs.\n5.7\/9). Now, if T0 is free to adjust the fit improves to \u03c72\u03bd = 5.7\/9,\nbut the new T0 = 0.54+0.23\n\u22120.54 is lower than Tbb. Thus, contrary to\nthe QPO spectra in soft states, here the QPO spectrum either con-\ntains the disc blackbody component, or the seed photon tempera-\nture in QPO spectra is lower than that in time averaged spectra. In\neither case the QPO spectrum slope is softer than the time averaged\nspectrum.\nIn the other two hard state observations, of 4U 1630-47, the\nQPO slope seems to be similar to the Comptonization slope in\nthe time averaged spectrum, but the residuals suggest somewhat\nhigher T0 (Fig. 4). When the time averaged model is renormalized\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\nQPO X-ray spectra 7\nFigure 3.

Allow-\ning \u0393 and T0 to adjust we obtain best fits with \u03c72\u03bd = 11.0\/17 and\n\u03c72\u03bd = 17.5\/17, and the confidence contours are plotted in Fig. 5.\nThe contours suggest that the QPO spectra are again somewhat\nsofter and indeed have higher T0 than the time averaged spectra,\nhowever the difference between the spectral slopes in not highly\nsignificant. We note then that for 4U 1630-47 the QPO spectra are\ncloser to the time averged spectra than those of XTE J1550-564\n(V). Since the time averaged spectra 4U 1630-47 are softer than\nthe spectra of XTE J1550-564 (V), we might be observing here a\ntransition from the hard state behaviour (as in XTE J1550-564) to\nthe soft state behaviour, where the QPO spectra are harder than the\ntime averaged spectra.\n4.3 The reprocessed component in the QPO spectra\nWe have checked if the reprocessed component is present in the\nQPO spectra. Firstly, we assume the time averaged continuum as\na model for the QPO, and let the reflection parameters, R, \u03be and\nRin to be free. Such models do not provide good fits, with only\ntwo cases when \u03c72\u03bd < 1.5 (Table 4; columns a and b). Therefore,\nalthough the reprocessed component is present in the model, it is\ndifficult to assess its statistical significance. In the two cases where\nthe fits are acceptable (XTE J1859+226, datasets I and IV), the\nreflection is significant.\nSecondly, we fit the QPO data with the THCOMP model al-\nlowing all its parameters, \u0393, kTe and T0 to adjust. The continuum\nis thus described correctly, which allows for meaningful determina-\ntion of the presence and parameters of the reprocessed component.\nWe then add the reprocessed component, assuming first a cold mat-\nter (\u03be = 0), and then allowing \u03be to adjust as well. In Table 4 we\npresent the quality of the initial model (i.e. no reflection) fits, and\nthe \u2206\u03c72 values when the reprocessed components are added.\nAdding the reprocessed component improves the fits in most\nof the datasets, with ionized reprocessing giving better fits than cold\nreprocessing. Reduction of \u03c72 values by 10\u201360 means that the re-\nprocessed component is highly significant.\nReflection amplitudes in the QPO spectra are generally rather\npoorly constrained. In the three anomalous very high state spectra\nof XTE J1550-564 the best fits are obtained for a pure reflected\ncomponent. However, the ionization parameter in the pure reflec-\ntion models is rather high, \u03be \u223c 105, which means that the Fe re-\nprocessing features are not very prominent. The 90 per cent lower\nlimits to R are rather low, nevertheless, reduction of \u03c72 by 11-22\nmeans that the component is highly significant in at least two of\nthose spectra.\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n8 M.A. Sobolewska and P.T. \u02d9Zycki\nFigure 4.

This\nextends previous studies of Churazov et al. (2001) (for soft state\nof Cyg X-1), and it argues for the origin of the amplitude of the\nvariability (including the QPO) in the hot plasma rather than in the\ncold disc.\nComparing the time averaged and the QPO spectra we ex-\nplicitly find that only one component, a thermal Comptonization\n(with its Compton reflection) is needed to describe the latter. How-\never, the QPO spectra are in most cases significantly different than\nthe Comptonized component in the time averaged spectra. Qualita-\ntively, we find an interesting anti-correlation: in soft spectral states\nthe QPO spectra are harder than the mean spectra, while they are\nsofter than the mean spectra in hard spectral states. Together with\ntwo intermediate cases this forms a continuous sequence. Quanti-\ntatively, the differences between the spectra can be described by a\ndifference in spectral indices or seed photons temperatures, or both,\nwith the statistical quality of the various descriptions being approx-\nimately the same.\nThe QPO spectra do contain the reprocessed component. In\nmost datasets their presence is highly statistically significant (99\nper cent or better), although the reflection amplitude is rather poorly\nconstrained. Because of that, it is not possible to determine if the\namplitude is different than that in the time averaged spectrum.\nIn Paper I we introduced a phenomenological model of QPO,\nwhere the background radial propagation model of broad band vari-\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\nQPO X-ray spectra 9\nTable 4.

The main parameters include the plasma heat-\ning rate, lheat, the cooling rate by soft disc photons, lsoft (here\nl \u2261 (L\/R)\u03c3T\/(mc\n3) is the compactness parameters), and the\namplitude of the reflected component (describing the coupling be-\ntween the heating and cooling). Our motivation for such a model is\nthat irrespectively of the physical mechanism behind the QPO, the\nmodulation of the emitted X-rays can only be produced by a mod-\nulation of one or more of the parameters actually determining the\nhard X-ray spectrum. We can now discuss our observational results\nin the light of that model.\nQPO spectra harder than the mean spectra can be obtained if\nthe QPO are produced by modulation of the heating rate while the\ncooling rate does not respond fully to lheat modulation. This pro-\nduces spectral pivoting around the low energy end of the spectrum,\nand, in consequence, r.m.s. variability increasing with energy. Such\na model might then be applicable to the soft spectral states dis-\ncussed in this paper. The model predicts a local maximum of the\nEW of the Fe K\u03b1 line at the QPO frequency (see fig. 3 in Paper I),\nbut the quality of our data is not sufficient to test this prediction.\nQPO spectra softer than the mean spectra can be produced\nby modulations driven by the cold disc. One possibility here is a\nmodulation of the cooling rate. This results in the spectra pivoting\naround an energy point intermediate between the low and high en-\nergy ends of the spectrum (see also Zdziarski et al. 2002). In the\nlimited energy band, e.g. that of RXTE\/PCA, it may correspond to\nthe r.m.s. spectra decreasing with energy.\nThe cooling rate may be modulated with or without modula-\ntion of the seed photons temperature. The difference between the\ntwo is that the QPO spectrum is monotonic in energy in the for-\nmer case but it has a very deep minimum (at the pivot energy) in\nthe latter case (see figs. 4 and 5 in Paper I). Additionally, QPO\nharmonics appear when Tbb is modulated, since the modulation of\nlsoft is then not sinusoidal (even if modulation of Tbb is). However,\nthe harmonics are limited to the soft disc component only, unlike in\nsome of our data, for example, XTE J1550-564 (I).\nThe other possibility of producing a soft QPO spectrum is to\nmodulate the amplitude of the reflected component, R, assuming\nthat it also describes the feedback between illuminating hard X-\nrays and the re-emitted soft disc photons cooling the hot plasma.\nBecause of the coupling, this again generates modulations of lsoft\nand the characteristic spectral pivoting. The most characteristic fea-\nture of this model is the strong Fe K\u03b1 line (and the entire repro-\ncessed component) at fQPO, directly resulting from modulations\nof R. Contrary to that, the model with lsoft modulation gives either\ngenerally weak Fe line, or at least a minimum at fQPO. The pres-\nence of the reprocessed component (including the Fe K\u03b1 line) in\nour QPO spectra makes modulation of R an interesting possibility\n(see also Miller & Homan 2005).\nWe note that models from Paper I involving modulation of\nlsoft predict very strong soft component in the QPO spectra, which\nis not observed. It is rather hard to envision a geometry where the\nmodulated soft flux would enter the hot plasma, but would not be\ndirected towards an observer. Modulation of R also produces some\nsoft component in the QPO spectra, but it appears less prominent\nthan the one from lsoft modulation models. Clearly, further devel-\nopment of the models is necessary to fully describe the data.\nAnother potentially useful diagnostics is the coherence func-\ntion. While variations in different energy bands are perfectly coher-\nent when R is modulated, the coherence function shows a complex\nbehaviour, with a number of minima, when lsoft and\/or Tbb are\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n10 M.A. Sobolewska and P.T. \u02d9Zycki\nmodulated. However, distinguishing between the models based on\nsuch predicted observables as the EW of the Fe K\u03b1 line, the coher-\nence function or the hard X-ray time lags would require better data\nthan currently available.\nIt needs to be emphasized that majority of physical models of\nQPO envision the QPO as driven by some kind of disc oscillations.\nHowever, our interpretation of the energy dependencies of low-f\nQPO, at least in soft spectral states, would rather point out to mod-\nulations of the heating rate in the hot plasma. If so, then those mod-\nels must find a way of transferring the disc oscillations to the hot\nplasma with 100 per cent efficiency, i.e. without affecting the disc\nemission. On the other hand, most of the models were formulated\nin the context of the high frequency QPO, where the energy depen-\ndencies might be different than those for the low-f QPO. The only\nwork where a physical model of the low-f QPO was constructed is\nthat by Giannios & Spruit (2004). They consider oscillations of a\nhot ion-supported accretion flow coupled to a outer cold disc. The\ncoupling is realized by a number of channels: hard X-rays illumi-\nnating the cold disc, hot protons heating the cold disc, the soft disc\nphotons cooling the hot flow. Spectral variability predicted by that\nmodel corresponds to our case of modulating the cooling rate, that\nis, the QPO spectra are softer than the time averaged spectra. This\nwould then be consistent with observed QPO behaviour in the hard\nstate. The overall geometry of a hot inner flow and an outer cold\ndisc fits that state too.\nConsidering that the usual broad band noise X-ray variability\nis driven by instabilities and flares in the hot plasma, it is obvious\nthat an important piece of physical understanding is still missing.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\n\u2022 The QPO energy spectra are harder than the time average\nspectra in soft spectral states, but they are softer than the time av-\neraged spectra in the hard state. The QPO spectra are similar in\nslope to the time averaged spectra, when the latter are intermediate\nin slope between hard and soft (\u0393 \u2248 2).\n\u2022 The disc component is absent in the QPO spectra.\n\u2022 Comparison of the observational data with simple models of\nspectral variability suggests that instabilities in the hot plasma drive\nthe low-f QPO in the soft state, while cold disc oscillations drive\nthe QPO in the hard state.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by Polish Committee of Scientific\nResearch through grants number 1P03D01626 and 2P03D01225.\nREFERENCES\nBelloni T., van der Klis M., Lewin W.
