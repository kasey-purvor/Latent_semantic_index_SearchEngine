They decompose as a direct sum of abelian subalgebras\nand their ideals relate nicely to this decomposition. The class of such\nalgebras is shown to be a formation whose residual is the ideal closure\nof the prefrattini subalgebras.\nMathematics Subject Classification 2000: 17B05, 17B20, 17B30, 17B50.\nKey Words and Phrases: Lie algebras, complemented, solvable, Frat-\ntini ideal, prefrattini subalgebra, residual, Lie A-algebra.\n1 Prefrattini subalgebras\nThroughout, L will denote a finite-dimensional solvable Lie algebra over a\nfield F . We define the nilpotent residual, L\u221e, of L be the smallest ideal of\nL such that L\/L\u221e is nilpotent. Clearly this is the intersection of the terms\nof the lower central series for L. The derived series for L is the sequence\nof ideals L(i) of L defined by L(0) = L, L(i+1) = [L(i), L(i)] for i \u2265 0; we\nwill also write L2 for L(1). If L(n) = 0 but L(n\u22121) 6= 0 we say that that L\n1\nhas derived length n. We say that L is completely solvable if L2 is nilpotent.\nAlgebra direct sums will be denoted by \u2295, whereas vector space direct sums\nwill be denoted by +\u02d9.\nThe Frattini subalgebra of L, \u03c6(L), is the intersection of the maximal\nsubalgebras of L. When L is solvable this is always an ideal of L, by [1,\nLemma 3.4]. For a subalgebra U of L we denote by [U : L] the set of all\nsubalgebras S of L with U \u2286 S \u2286 L. We say that [U : L] is complemented\nif, for any S \u2208 [U : L] there is a T \u2208 [U : L] such that S \u2229 T = U and\n< S, T >= L. We denote by [U : L]max the set of maximal subalgebras in\n[U : L]; that is, the set of maximal subalgebras of L containing U .\nLet\n0 = A0 \u2282 A1 \u2282 . . . \u2282 An = L\nbe a chief series for L. We say that Ai\/Ai\u22121 is a Frattini chief factor if\nAi\/Ai\u22121 \u2286 \u03c6(L\/Ai\u22121); it is complemented if there is a maximal subalgebra\nM of L such that L = Ai +M and Ai \u2229M = Ai\u22121. When L is solvable it is\neasy to see that a chief factor is Frattini if and only if it is not complemented.\nWe define the set I by i \u2208 I if and only if Ai\/Ai\u22121 is not a Frattini chief\nfactor of L. For each i \u2208 I put\nMi = {M \u2208 [Ai\u22121, L]max : Ai 6\u2286M}.\nThen B is a prefrattini subalgebra of L if\nB =\n\u22c2\ni\u2208I\nMi for some Mi \u2208Mi.\nIt was shown in [7] that the definition of prefrattini subalgebras does not\ndepend on the choice of chief series.\nThe subalgebra B avoids Ai\/Ai\u22121 if B \u2229 Ai = B \u2229 Ai\u22121; likewise, B\ncovers Ai\/Ai\u22121 if B + Ai = B + Ai\u22121. Let \u03a0(L) be the set of prefrattini\nsubalgebras of L. Then the following results were established in [7].\nTheorem 1.1 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra over a field F .\n(i) If B is a prefrattini subalgebra of L then it covers all Frattini chief\nfactors of L and avoids the rest.\n(ii) If B is a prefrattini subalgebra of L then\ndimB =\n\u2211\ni\/\u2208I\n(dimAi \u2212 dimAi\u22121);\nin particular, all prefrattini subalgebras of L have the same dimension.\n2\n(iii) If A is an ideal of L and S \u2208 \u03a0(L) then (S +A)\/A \u2208 \u03a0(L\/A).\n(iv) \u03c6(L) =\n\u22c2\nB\u2208\u03a0(L)B.\n(v) If L is completely solvable then \u03a0(L) = {\u03c6(L)}.\n(vi) Suppose that F has characteristic p and that L\u221e has nilpotency class\nless than p. Then the elements of \u03a0(L) are conjugate under inner\nautomorphisms of the form exp(adx) with x \u2208 L\u221e.\n(vii) L is complemented if and only if \u03a0(L) = {0}.\nIf L2 is not nilpotent then \u03a0(L) can contain more than one element (see\n[7]).\n2 The Prefrattini Residual\nHere we use the ideas of the previous section to re-examine complemented\nLie algebras: that is, Lie algebras L for which [0 : L] is complemented, as\nstudied in [5]. Results for groups similar to those in the next theorem were\nstated by Bechtell in [2].\nTheorem 2.1 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra over any field F . Then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) L is complemented;\n(ii) The prefrattini subalgebras of L are all trivial;\n(iii) L and all of its epimorphic images are \u03c6-free; and\n(iv) L splits over all of its ideals.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii) : If L is complemented then \u03a0(L) = {0}, by Theorem 1.1\n(vii).\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii) : Suppose that \u03a0(L) = {0}, let L\/B be any epimorphic image\nof L, and suppose that \u03c6(L\/B) 6= 0. Then there is a Frattini chief fac-\ntor of L, C\/B, contained in \u03c6(L\/B). But now any prefrattini subalgebra\nhas dimension greater than or equal to dim(C\/B), by Theorem 1.1 (ii): a\ncontradiction. This establishes (iii).\n(iii) \u21d2 (iv) : Suppose that L and all of its epimorphic images are \u03c6-free.\nWe use induction on dimL. The result is clear if dimL = 1. So suppose\n3\nit holds for Lie algebras of dimension less than dimL, and let B be a non-\ntrivial ideal of L. If B is a minimal ideal of L then the result follows from\n[3, Lemma 7.2]. If B is not a minimal ideal, let A be a minimal ideal of\nL contained in B. Then L\/A splits over B\/A by the inductive hypothesis.\nThus there is a subalgebra C of L with A \u2286 C such that L = B + C and\nB \u2229 C = A. Moreover, there is a subalgebra M of L such that L = A+\u02d9M\nby [3, Lemma 7.2]. But now C = A+\u02d9(M \u2229 C), whence L = B+\u02d9(M \u2229 C),\nand (iv) is established.\n(iv) \u21d2 (i) : Suppose that L splits over all of its ideals. We use induction on\ndimL again. The result is clear if dimL = 1. So suppose it holds for Lie\nalgebras of dimension less than dimL, and let A be a minimal ideal of L.\nThen L = A+\u02d9M for some subalgebraM of L. It is clear thatM \u223c= L\/A splits\nover all of its ideals and so is complemented by the inductive hypothesis. It\nfollows from [5, Lemma 4] that L is complemented. \u0003\nWe say that L is elementary if \u03c6(B) = 0 for every subalgebra B of L. Let\nA be a vector space of finite dimension and let B be an abelian completely\nreducible subalgebra of gl(A). It was shown in [8, Proposition 2.4] that\nthe semidirect product A \u22ca B is an elementary Lie algebra; we call such\nan algebra an elementary Lie algebra of type I. Then we have the following\ncharacterisation of completely solvable complemented Lie algebras.\nTheorem 2.2 Let L be a completely solvable Lie algebra. Then the follow-\ning are equivalent:\n(i) L is complemented;\n(ii) \u03c6(L) = 0;\n(iii) L is elementary; and\n(iv) L \u223c= A\u2295E, where A is an abelian Lie algebra and E is an elementary\nLie algebra of type I.\nProof. The equivalence of (i), (ii) and (iii) is [5, Theorem 1]. The equiv-\nalence of (iv) follows from [8, Theorem 2.5] (the requirement of a perfect\nfield in that result is required only to establish that an elementary algebra\nis completely solvable, and that is not needed here). \u0003\nLemma 2.3 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra, let B, C be ideals of L with\nB \u2229 C = 0, and suppose that L\/B and L\/C are complemented. Then L\nsplits over B and over C.\n4\nProof. We show that L splits over C. Since L\/B is complemented there is\na subalgebra U of L with B \u2286 U such that L = (B + C) + U = C + U and\n(B + C) \u2229 U = B. Hence C \u2229 U \u2286 C \u2229 (B + C) \u2229 U = C \u2229B = 0. \u0003\nA class H of finite-dimensional solvable Lie algebras is called a homo-\nmorph if it contains, along with an algebra L, all epimorphic images of L.\nA homomorph H is called a formation if L\/M,L\/N \u2208 H, where M,N are\nideals of L, implies that L\/M \u2229N \u2208 H. If H is a formation then, for every\nsolvable Lie algebra L there is a smallest ideal R such that L\/R \u2208 H; this\nis called the H-residual of L. We denote the class of solvable complemented\nLie algebras by C. Then we have the following result.\nTheorem 2.4 C is a formation.\nProof. First note that C is a homomorph, by [5, Lemma 3]. Let B, C be\ndistinct ideals of L with L\/B, L\/C \u2208 C. We need to show that L\/B\u2229C \u2208 C.\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that B \u2229 C = 0. Let 0 < Bk <\n. . . < B1 = B be part of a chief series for L. We use induction on k. If k = 1\nthen B is minimal ideal of L and the result follows from Lemma 2.3 and [5,\nLemma 4]. So suppose it holds whenever k < n and that we have k = n.\nThen B\/Bn, (C+Bn)\/Bn are distinct ideals of L\/Bn and the corresponding\nfactor algebras are isomorphic to L\/B and (L\/C)\/((C+Bn)\/C) respectively.\nThese are both complemented (by [5, Lemma 3] in the case of the second).\nIt follows from the inductive hypothesis that L\/Bn is complemented. But\nnow L is complemented by Lemma 2.3 and [5, Lemma 4], and the result\nfollows. \u0003\nWe define the Prefrattini residual of a solvable Lie algebra L to be\npi(L) =\n\u22c2\n{B : B is an ideal of L and L\/B \u2208 C}.\nClearly pi(L) is the smallest ideal of L such that L\/pi(L) \u2208 C. It is also the\nideal closure of the prefrattini subalgebras of L, by Theorem 2.1.\nThe class of solvable elementary Lie algebras is also a formation whose\nresidual is the elementary commutator, E(L) (see [4, Theorem 5.1]). The\nabelian socle of L, Asoc L, is the sum of the minimal abelian ideals of L.\nWe have the following properties of pi(L).\nProposition 2.5 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra. Then\n(i) \u03c6(L) \u2286 pi(L) \u2286 E(L); if L is completely solvable then \u03c6(L) = pi(L) =\nE(L);\n5\n(ii) if A is an ideal of L then pi(L\/A) = (pi(L) + A)\/A; in particular,\npi(L\/\u03c6(L)) = pi(L)\/\u03c6(L);\n(iii) pi(L) is nilpotent if and only if pi(L) = \u03c6(L); and\n(iv) if B is a prefrattini subalgebra of L then pi(L) = B + pi(L)\u221e.\nProof. (i) This follows from Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2.\n(ii) Let A be an ideal of L and put pi(L\/A) = P\/A. Then we have that L\/P \u223c=\n(L\/A)\/(P\/A) is complemented. Hence pi(L)+A \u2286 P . Also (L\/A)\/((pi(L)+\nA)\/A) \u223c= (L\/pi(L))\/((pi(L) + A)\/pi(L)) is complemented, by [5, Lemma 3],\nso P \u2286 pi(L) +A and the result follows.\n(iii) If pi(L) = \u03c6(L) then pi(L) is nilpotent, by [3, Theorem 6.1]. Conversely\nlet pi(L) be nilpotent. Suppose that \u03c6(L) = 0, let N be the nilradical of L\nand let B be a prefrattini subalgebra of L. ThenN = Asoc L = A1\u2295. . .\u2295An,\nwhere Ai is a minimal ideal of L for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and L = N+\u02d9C for some\nsubalgebra C of L, by [3, Theorems 7.3, 7.4]. Then (A1\u2295 . . .\u2295Ai+1)\/(A1\u2295\n. . . \u2295 Ai) is a complemented chief factor of L for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, and\nso is avoided by B. It follows that B \u2229N = 0. But then pi(L) = 0 and the\nconverse follows from (ii).\n(iv) We have that (B+pi(L)\u221e)\/pi(L)\u221e is a prefrattini subalgebra of L\/pi(L)\u221e\nby Theorem 1.1 (iii). Moreover, pi(L\/pi(L)\u221e) = pi(L)\/pi(L)\u221e, by (ii) above,\nand this is nilpotent. It follows from (iii) that pi(L\/pi(L)\u221e) = \u03c6(L\/pi(L)\u221e) \u2286\n(B+pi(L)\u221e)\/pi(L)\u221e, by Theorem 1.1 (iv), whence pi(L) \u2286 B+pi(L)\u221e. The\nreverse inclusion is clear. \u0003\nWe define the nilpotent series for L inductively by N0(L) = 0, Ni+1\/Ni =\nN(L\/Ni(L) for i > 0, where N(L) denotes the nilradical of L. Finally we\nhave the following characterisation of solvable complemented Lie algebras\nwhich is analogous to a result of Zacher for groups (see [10]).\nTheorem 2.6 The solvable Lie algebra L is complemented if and only if\n\u03c6(L\/Ni(L)) = 0 for all i \u2265 1.\nProof. Suppose first that L is complemented. Then L\/Ni(L) is comple-\nmented, by [5, Lemma 3], and so \u03c6(L\/Ni(L)) = 0, by Theorem 2.1.\nSuppose conversely that \u03c6(L\/Ni(L)) = 0 for all i \u2265 1. We use induction\non dimL. The result is clear if dimL = 1, so suppose the result holds for\nall solvable Lie algebras of dimension less than that of L. Then L\/N(L) is\ncomplemented, by the inductive hypothesis. Moreover, we have that L =\nN(L)+\u02d9B for some subalgebra B of L, and N(L) = Asoc L, by [3, Theorems\n6\n7.3, 7.4]. Put Asoc L = A1 \u2295 . . .\u2295 An. If n = 1, then L splits over A1 and\nL\/A1 is complemented, so L is complemented, by [5, Lemma 4]. So suppose\nthat n > 1 and put Ci = A1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 A\u02c6i \u2295 . . . \u2295 An, where A\u02c6i means that\nAi is missing from the direct sum. Then L\/Ci splits over Asoc L\/Ci and\n(L\/Ci)\/(Asoc L\/Ci) \u223c= L\/N(L) is complemented, so L\/Ci is complemented,\nby [5, Lemma 4] again. It follows from Theorem 2.4 that L \u223c= L\/ \u2229ni=1 Ci is\ncomplemented. \u0003\nA consequence of the corresponding result for groups is that every normal\nsubgroup of a complemented solvable group is itself complemented. The\nanalogue of this holds for completely solvable Lie algebras, by Theorem 2.2.\nHowever, the analogue does not hold for all solvable Lie algebras as the\nfollowing example shows.\nExample 2.1 Let F be a field of characteristic p and consider the Lie al-\ngebra L = (\u2295p\u22121i=0Fei)+\u02d9Fx+\u02d9Fy with [ei, x] = ei+1 for i = 0, . . . , p \u2212 2,\n[ep\u22121, x] = e0, [ei, y] = iei for i = 0, . . . , p \u2212 1, [x, y] = x, and all other\nproducts zero. Then A = \u2295p\u22121i=0Fei is the unique minimal ideal of L, L splits\nover A and L\/A is two-dimensional and so complemented. It follows from\n[5, Lemma 4] that L is complemented. However, B = A+\u02d9Fx = L2 is an\nideal of L, and \u03c6(B) = F (x0 + . . . xp\u22121) so B is not complemented.\n3 Decomposition results for complemented alge-\nbras\nA Lie algebra L is called an A-algebra if every nilpotent subalgebra of L is\nabelian. Here we have some basic structure theorems which mirror those\nobtained for solvable Lie A-algebras in [6]. Where proofs are very similar to\nthe correponding one in [6] we will sketch the proof for the convenience of\nthe reader and give a reference to [6] for more details. First we see that L\nsplits over the terms in its derived series.\nTheorem 3.1 (c.f. [6, Theorem 3.1]) Let L be a solvable complemented\nLie algebra. Then L splits over each term in its derived series. Moreover,\nthe Cartan subalgebras of L(i)\/L(i+2) are precisely the subalgebras that are\ncomplements to L(i+1)\/L(i+2) for i \u2265 0.\n7\nProof. The first assertion follows from Theorem 2.1 (iv). The second is a\nconsequence of [9, Theorem 4.4.1.1]. \u0003\nThis gives us the following characterisation of solvable complemented Lie\nalgebras.\nCorollary 3.2 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra of derived length n+1. Then\nL is complemented if and only if the following hold:\n(i) L = An+\u02d9An\u22121+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9A0 where Ai is an abelian subalgebra of L for\neach 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n;\n(ii) L(i) = An+\u02d9An\u22121+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9Ai for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n; and\n(iii) L(i)\/L(i+1) is completely reducible as an (L\/L(i+1))-module for each\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nProof. Suppose first that L is complemented. By Theorem 3.1 there is\na subalgebra Bn of L such that L = L\n(n)+\u02d9Bn. Put An = L\n(n). Similarly\nBn \u223c= L\/L\n(n) is complemented, by [5, Lemma 3], so Bn = An\u22121+\u02d9Bn\u22121\nwhere An\u22121 = (Bn)\n(n\u22121). Continuing in this way we get (i). A straight-\nforward induction proof shows (ii). Finally, L(i)\/L(i+1) \u2286 N(L\/L(i+1)) =\nAsoc(L\/L(i+1)), by Theorem 2.1 (iii) and [3, Theorem 7.4], which gives (iii).\nSuppose now that (i), (ii) and (iii) hold. Then L is complemented by\nrepeated use of [5, Lemma 4]. \u0003\nNext we aim to show the relationship between ideals of L and the de-\ncomposition given in Corollary 3.2. First we need the following lemmas.\nLemma 3.3 Let L be a Lie algebra. Then Z(L) \u2229 L2 \u2286 \u03c6(L).\nProof. Let M be any maximal subalgebra of L. If Z(L) 6\u2286 M then L =\nM + Z(L) and L2 \u2286M . \u0003\nLemma 3.4 (c.f. [6, Lemma 3.4]) Let L be a solvable complemented Lie\nalgebra of derived length \u2264 n+1, and suppose that L = B+\u02d9C where B = L(n)\nand C is a subalgebra of L. If D is an ideal of L then D = (B\u2229D)+\u02d9(C\u2229D).\nProof. Let L be a counter-example for which dimL + dimD is minimal.\nSuppose first that D2 6= 0. Then D2 = (B\u2229D2)+\u02d9(C\u2229D2) by the minimality\ncondition. Moreover, by considering L\/D2 we have that D = B\u2229D+\u02d9C\u2229D,\n8\na contradiction. We therefore have that D2 = 0. Similarly, by considering\nL\/B \u2229D, we have that B \u2229D = 0.\nPut E = C(n\u22121). Then (D + B)\/B and (E + B)\/B are abelian ideals,\nand so are inside the nilradical of the complemented Lie algebra L\/B, which\nis abelian. Hence\n[D,E] \u2286 [D +B,E +B] \u2286 B and [D,E] \u2286 B \u2229D = 0;\nthat is, D \u2286 ZL(E) = ZB(E) + ZC(E).\nNow L(n\u22121) = B + E, so B = L(n) = (B + E)2 = [B,E]. Let L(n\u22121) =\nL0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L\n(n\u22121) relative to adE. Then B \u2286\nL1 so that ZB(E) \u2286 L0 \u2229 L1 = 0, whence D \u2286 ZL(E) = ZC(E) \u2286 C and\nthe result follows. \u0003\nTheorem 3.5 (c.f. [6, Theorem 3.5]) Let L be a solvable complemented Lie\nalgebra of derived length n + 1 with nilradical N , and let K be an ideal of\nL and A a minimal ideal of L. Then, with the same notation as Corollary\n3.2,\n(i) K = (K \u2229An)+\u02d9(K \u2229An\u22121)+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9(K \u2229A0);\n(ii) N = An+\u02d9(N \u2229An\u22121)+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9(N \u2229A0);\n(iii) Z(L(i)) = N \u2229Ai for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n; and\n(iv) A \u2286 N \u2229Ai for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nProof. (i) We have that L = An+\u02d9Bn where An = L\n(n) from the proof\nof Corollary 3.2. It follows from Lemma 3.4 that K = (K \u2229 An) + (K \u2229\nBn). But now K \u2229 Bn is an ideal of Bn, which is complemented, so Bn =\nAn\u22121+\u02d9Bn\u22121. Applying Lemma 3.4 again gives K \u2229Bn = (K \u2229An\u22121)+\u02d9(K \u2229\nBn\u22121). Continuing in this way gives the required result.\n(ii) This is clear from (i), since An = L\n(n) = N \u2229An.\n(iii) We have that L(i) = L(i+1)+\u02d9Ai from Corollary 3.2, and Z(L\n(i)) \u2229\nL(i+1) \u2286 \u03c6(L(i)), by Lemma 3.3, whence Z(L(i)) \u2229 L(i+1) \u2286 \u03c6(L) = 0, using\n[3, Lemma 4.1]. It follows from (i) that\nZ(L(i)) = (Z(L(i)) \u2229 L(i+1)) + (Z(L(i)) \u2229Ai) = Z(L\n(i)) \u2229Ai \u2286 N \u2229Ai.\nIt remains to show that N \u2229 Ai \u2286 Z(L\n(i)); that is, [N \u2229 Ai, L\n(i)] = 0. We\nuse induction on the derived length of L. If L has derived length one the\nresult is clear. So suppose it holds for Lie algebras of derived length \u2264 k,\n9\nand let L have derived length k + 1. Then B = Ak\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + A0 \u223c= L\/L\n(k)\nis a solvable complemented Lie algebra of derived length k, and, if N is the\nnilradical of L, then N \u2229 Ai is inside the nilradical of B for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264\nk \u2212 1, so [N \u2229 Ai, B\n(i)] = 0 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1, by the inductive hypothesis.\nBut [N \u2229 Ai, Ak] = [N \u2229 Ai, L\n(k)] \u2286 [N,N ] = 0, for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k, whence\n[N \u2229Ai, L\n(i)] = [N \u2229Ai, Ak +B\n(i)] = 0 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\n(iv) We have A \u2286 L(i), A 6\u2286 L(i+1) for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Now [L(i), A] \u2286\n[L(i), L(i)] = L(i+1), so [L(i), A] 6= A. It follows that [L(i), A] = 0, whence\nA \u2286 Z(L(i)) = N \u2229Ai, by (iii). \u0003\nA Lie algebra L is called monolithic if it has a unique minimal ideal,\ncalled the monolith of L.\nCorollary 3.6 Let L be a solvable complemented monolithic Lie algebra of\nderived length n+1 with monolithW . ThenW = N = An = L\n(n) = CL(W ),\nZ(L) = 0 and [L,W ] =W .\nProof. First note that N = An+\u02d9N \u2229An\u22121+\u02d9 . . . +\u02d9N \u2229A0 by Theorem 3.5(i).\nMoreover, N \u2229Ai is an ideal of L for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121, by Theorem 3.5(iii).\nBut if N \u2229Ai 6= 0 then W \u2286 An\u2229N \u2229Ai = 0 if i 6= n. Hence W = N = An.\nAlso W = Asoc L = N , by Theorem 2.1 (iii) and [3, Theorem 7.4], and\nN = CL(N) by [6, Lemma 2.4].\nFinally, if Z(L) 6= 0 then W \u2286 Z(L) \u2229 L2 = 0, by Theorem 3.5, a\ncontradiction. Hence Z(L) = 0. It follows from this that [L,W ] 6= 0,\nwhence [L,W ] =W . \u0003\nGiven these shared properties between the classes of solvable Lie A-\nalgebras and solvable complemented Lie algebras it is natural to ask whether\neither class is contained in the other. This is not the case, as the following\nexamples show.\nExample 3.1 Let L = Fx + Fy + Fb with [x, b] = x, [y, b] = y \u2212 x, other\nproducts being zero. Then \u03c6(L) = Fx, so L is not complemented. However,\nit is an A-algebra. For, the two-dimensional subalgebras are of the form\nFx + F (\u03b1y + \u03b2b) (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F ), and these are nilpotent only if \u03b2 = 0 and, in\nthat case, it is abelian.\nExamples of solvable complemented Lie algebras L that are not A-\nalgebras are a little harder to construct. In particular, if L is completely\nsolvable and complemented then it is elementary, by Theorem 2.2, and so\nis an A-algebra. However, such algebras do exist in characteristic p as is\nshown below.\n10\nExample 3.2 Let F be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, let\nL be the algebra described in Example 2.1 and let C be a faithful completely\nreducible L-module. Put X = C+\u02d9L, where B2 = 0 and L acts on B under\nthe given L-module action. Then repeated use of [5, Lemma 4] shows that\nX is complemented. However, X is solvable of index four and so cannot be\nan A-algebra, by Drensky\u2019s Theorem (see [6, Theorem 6.2]).\nNotice that an easy extension of the above construction shows that, over\nan algebraically closed field, there are solvable complemented Lie algebras\nof arbitrary solvable index, whereas solvable Lie A-algebras over such a field\nhave solvable index at most three.\nReferences\n[1] D.W.
