The spatial and spectral properties of a pulsed\nsignal that has been amplified in a high-power semiconduc-\ntor laser thereby strongly depend on both the geometry of the\nlaser \u0001in particular the waveguide geometry\u0002 and the specific\nrealization of the current injection via an electronic contact.\nMore recent investigations8 on tapered laser amplifiers have\nrevealed the influence of the tapered angle and the length of\nthe waveguide section on the beam quality and power of the\namplified signal. It could be shown that a tapered angle that\nhas been adjusted to the diffraction angle of the injected\nGaussian beam and a waveguide length of a few 100 \u0001m\nprovide good beam quality and high small signal gain with\nonly small contributions of amplified spontaneous emission\n\u0001ASE\u0002 in the emitted radiation.\nWhile previous studies have mainly addressed the am-\nplification of continuous-wave \u0001cw\u0002 optical signals, in this\nletter, we focus on an investigation of the design of the\nwaveguide section and the electronic contact of tapered laser\namplifiers \u0001InGaAs, 2\u20133 mm length\u0002 that should be opti-\nmized for picosecond pulse amplification.

Gehrig and O. Hess Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 251106 \u00022005\u0001light field dynamics have been taken into account in the cal-\nculation. Indeed, it is the dynamic spatially dependent inter-\nplay of carrier diffusion, light diffraction, and microscopic\ncarrier excitation and relaxation that affect the spatial and\nspectral properties of the light pulse during its propagation.\nIn the calculations, the injection current was chosen such that\nthe carrier inversion within the amplifier is signficantly\nabove the threshold value \u0001N\u00053Nthr\u0002, and the input power is\n1.1Pin\nsat\n\u2014where Pin\nsat denotes the input power required to re-\nduce the inversion to transparency when reaching the output\nfacet. The material reflectivity of the facets has been set to a\nvalue of 10\u22122. In the linear geometry \u0003Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004,\nthe dynamic interaction of counterpropagating waves leads\nto characteristic transverse modulations in the entrance re-\ngion of the taper \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 that are via the dynamic light\nfield propagation transferred to respective filament structures\nin the near field \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. The nonlinear waveguide geom-\netry reduces and suppresses counterpropagation effects lead-\ning to a homogeneous light field distribution near the\nwaveguide-amplifier connection \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004 and an almost\nGaussian-shaped near field \u0003Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002\u0004. Generally, the inter-\naction of counterpropagating waves strongly depends on the\nquality of the antireflexion coating. For cw beams, it has\nbeen shown10 that the facet reflectivity of tapered amplifiers\nwith linear geometry should be less than 10\u22124. However, as\ncan be seen in Fig. 1, a laser-amplifier design with curved\nwaveguide section modifies these requirements: The nonlin-\near waveguide section leads to an efficient coupling of the\ninjected light field into the amplifying region and to a sig-\nnificant reduction of counterpropagation effects. In a tapered\namplifier with a curved waveguide section, the \u201ceffective\nreflectivity\u201d defined by both the reflectivity of the facets \u0001in-\ncluding coating\u0002 and the phase front of the counterpropagat-\ning light wave is thus reduced by approximately two orders\nof magnitude.\nA further increase in quality and power of the optical\nsignal \u0001cw beam or pulse alike\u0002 can be obtained with an\nappropriate design of the electronic contact. As expected, the\ncarrier injection via the contact leads to a characteristic car-\nrier distribution within the active area of the laser amplifier.\nHowever, the geometric design of the contact plays a signifi-\ncant role for the resulting spatiotemporally varying light field\ndistribution and filament formation.

Redistribution subject tomodulated contact. The suitable choice of, e.g., the length\nand periodicity of the modulated section, however, often re-\nmains an open question. A systematic variation of the shape\nand periodicity of the current contacts should then allow us\nto determine the influence of a spatially varying carrier in-\njection. Specifically, we consider a laser amplifier in which\nthe electronic contact in the entrance region of the taper is\nperiodically modulated in propagation direction. Variable pa-\nrameters are the length of the modulated section \u0001Lmod\u0002, the\nlength of a single contact region \u0001Lj1\u0002, as well as the length\nof the umpumped regions \u0001Lj0\u0002. One might immediately\nwonder, if and how the structuring of the contact may influ-\nence the spatiotemporal dynamics and thus keep filament\nformation at a low level. In order to answer this question, we\nhave systematically varied the characteristic lengths Lmod,\nLj1, and Lj0. Figure 2 shows calculated intensity snapshots\npertaining to a tapered amplifier \u0001N\u00053Nthr, length of the\nmodulated section Lmod=600 \u0001m\u0002 during the propagation of\na picosecond pulse. In this particular example, the length of\nthe umpumped area is Lj0=2.5 \u0001m \u0001left\u0002 and Lj0=10 \u0001m\n\u0001right\u0002, respectively, and the input power is 0.8Pin\nsat\n. In prin-\nciple, the inhomogeneous contact design keeps the injection\ncurrent density in the entrance region at a low level and thus\nreduces lateral structuring and filament formation. The spa-\ntiotemporal dynamics near the waveguide-taper transition via\npropagation and the dynamic coupling of transverse with\nlongitudinal degrees of freedom is also transferred to the\npropagation direction leading to good pulse-signal properties\nnear the output facet. However, it is important to note that\nthe laser-internal light-matter interaction and the respective\ncharacteristic interaction length \u0001e.g., carrier diffusion, light\ndiffraction\u0002 give upper and lower limits to the contact design,\nrespectively. This is of particular importance for the length of\nthe umpumped area: If this length significantly exceeds the\nlaser-internal interaction length \u0001which typically lies in the\n\u0001m regime\u0002, a detoriation instead of an improvement of the\nbeam quality will arise. Our simulations demonstrate that\nlarge umpumped regions lead to an inhomogeneous amplifi-\ncation within the pulse shape \u0003see Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002\u0004. This results in a\nloss of phase information and coherence. The pulse breaks\nup and is significantly deformed \u0003Fig. 2\u0001d\u0002\u0004. In addition, a\nsignificant detoriation of the gain can be ovserved: Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\nshows \u0001for the same current and input power\u0002 the spatiotem-\nporally integrated values of the gain as calculated within the\nFIG. 2. Propagation of a picosecond pulse in a tapered amplifier with a\nlength of the unpumped area of Lj0=2.5 \u0001m \u0001a,b\u0002 and Lj0=10 \u0001m \u0001c,d\u0002.frame of the complete set of spatiotemporally resolved\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n251106-3 E. Gehrig and O. Hess Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 251106 \u00022005\u0001Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations. If the length of the unpumped\nregion is significantly larger than approximately 5 \u0001m, the\ninduced phase changes lead to a reduction of the over-all\ngain. This effect is even more pronounced if the input power\nis very low \u0001i.e., in the low signal regime\u0002: In this case, the\npulse amplitude is not sufficiently high to sustain internal\ncoherence during the passage of the umpumped regions so\nthat the shape and duration of the injected pulse is not main-\ntained. The laser-internal interaction lengths given by diffu-\nsion, diffraction, and scattering \u0001typically in the \u0001m regime\u0002\nconsequently represent and define the maximum length of\nthe umpumped region.\nTo gain further insight in the influence of the contact\nmodulation on the amplification, Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002 displays the de-\npendence of the integrated total gain on the length of the\nmodulated section in the taper. In structures with a long\nmodulated section, our simulations reveal a noticable influ-\nence of the curvature of the phase front defined by the propa-\ngation of the injected Gaussian beam \u0001i.e., beam waist and\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject totion length, the curvature of the phase front of the light field\ndeviates to a stronger degree from an even phase front. As a\nconsequence, discontinuities arise where the propagating\nlight fields encounter the perpendicularly arranged sequence\nof pumped and unpumped regions. If the length of the modu-\nlated area extends too far in the taper \u0001more than, e.g., 1 mm\u0002\nthis \u201cmismatch\u201d between phase curvature and contact sec-\ntions leads to a strong reduction in the overall amplification\n\u0003see Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004.\nThe results of our parameter variation can be summa-\nrized as follows. A curved waveguide significantly reduces\ncounterpropagation effects. A spatially structured contact\nsection allows, for suitable design, filament supression and\nconsequently improves the quality of an amplified picosec-\nond pulse. However, to prevent a transverse deterioation of\nthe signal associated with the curved phase front of the\npropagating Gaussian beam, the modulated contact should\nnot cover the whole taper but be restricted to an area imme-\ndiately behind the waveguide. Finally, the most critical pa-\nrameter is represented by the length of the unpumped area.\nFor low input powers, the value of this parameter should not\nsignificantly exceed the \u0001m regime in order to sustain the\ncoherence properties of the light field during propagation.\n1D.
