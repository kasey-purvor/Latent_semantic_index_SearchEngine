Political rationalities, as Foucault explains, are ways of \nrendering reality knowable for the purpose of governance. Contemporary state \ngovernance, he suggests, consists of a triangle of such rationalities; sovereignty, \ndiscipline and government,1 which together he terms \u2018governmentality\u2019. Early \nsovereign technologies entailed the use of repressive force by the state, in an effort to \nestablish and maintain effective control over geographical territory, exemplified by the \nspectacle of the public execution. Of greater interest to Foucault, however, are the \ncomplex modern forms of governance, exacted through a combination of disciplinary \nand governmental technologies, operating not simply repressively but productively, \ndesigned to strengthen the state by improving the very soul of the subject. Discipline, on \nthe one hand, entails the production of docile and co-operative individuals (through \nprocesses of surveillance, classification and normalization) and populations (through \n                                                 \n\u2022 Law Department, University of Durham, 50 North Bailey, Durham, DH1 3ET.

Miller, The Foucault Effect: Studies in \nGovernmentality (1991).  \n 1\nprocesses of bio-power). Government, on the other, reflects more recent attempts by the \nstate to exercise power \u2018from a distance\u2019 by encouraging individuals to engage \nindependently in their own self-governance, and the governance of others, in line with \nits ow\n ethically to secure the \nwell-b\nhemselves and act upon themselves to make themselves \n target and process, increasingly implicated in the state\u2019s governmental \nstrategi\n                                                \nn objectives.  \nAn Anglo-Saxon Neo-Foucauldian school has developed the concept of \ngovernmentality, applying it to the operation of power within the modern liberal \ndemocratic state. Nikolas Rose, in particular, maps the genealogy of contemporary \nWestern liberal democracies using three political rationalities: classical, social and \nadvanced liberalism.2 Rose equates advanced liberal rule with the role of neo-liberalism \nin the \u2018death of the social\u2019, deploying the concept of government to explain the \nharnessing (or \u2018responsibilization\u20193) of a variety of statutory, voluntary and commercial \nactors and organisations in place of the centralised disciplinary techniques of state \nwelfare. He explores, in particular, the rise of what he terms \u2018ethopolitics\u2019, by which \nindividuals are encouraged to continually work on themselves\neing of themselves and their dependents. As he explains: \nIf discipline individualizes and normalizes, and biopower collectivizes and \nsocializes, ethopolitics concerns itself with the self-techniques by which human \nbeings should judge t\nbetter than they are.4  \nOf particular importance for Rose, as we shall see, is the role of \u2018community\u2019 as both \nethopolitical\nes.5 \nNeo-Foucauldian theorists continue to explore the apparent rise of advanced \nliberal forms of governance within the specific field of crime control,6 including recent \nanalysis of youth justice policy under New Labour.7 Similarly, I want to examine the \n \n2 N.

In this paper, I suggest that the rise of the \u2018naming and \nshaming\u2019 of the ASBO subject can be usefully explained in terms of the complex and \ncontra\ngovernance\u2019.12 Second, a diachronic model of advanced liberal governance highlights \n                                                \ndictory governmental mentalities and technologies of the advanced liberal state.  \nIn so doing, I acknowledge from the outset criticisms that the tendency to equate \nadvanced liberal forms of rule with the governmental techniques of neo-liberalism \nprovides only a cursory analysis of contemporary crime control in England and \nWales.10 I return instead to Foucault\u2019s sovereignty-discipline-governmentality triangle, \nrecognising, as Stenson does, the synchronic rather than diachronic interrelationship \nbetween these three rationalities.11 This aspect of Foucault\u2019s work has two important \nimplications for a theory of contemporary governance.  First, rather than positioning \nadvanced liberalism as diametrically opposed to the social, it explains the continuance \nof social forms of governance within the advanced liberal state. Thus, while Rose might \ntalk of the death of the social, I prefer what Pavlich terms the rise of \u2018co-social \n \n8 For a general introduction to the Government\u2019s \u2018Respect\u2019 agenda, see E.

The ASBO has received almost universal criticism from \nacademic commentators. Criticisms focus upon both the legal and criminological implications of the \norder. Criminological assessments note the high breach rate, bringing many young people prematurely \nwithin the criminal justice system, together with the failure to tackle the underlying causes of anti-social \nbehaviour: E.

Legal criticisms highlight the hybrid nature of the order, allowing an \nindividual to be brought within the ambit of the criminal law without the benefit of the procedural legal \nprotections granted to criminal defendants, and the breadth and vagueness of the definition of anti-social \nbehaviour: Ashworth et al, \u2018Neighbouring on the oppressive: the Government\u2019s \u201canti-social behaviour \norder\u201d proposals\u2019 (1998) 16(1) Criminal Justice 7. \n10 D.

In fact, as Stenson contends, \u2018use of force, symbolic \nrepresentations of force and juridical authority \u2026 is a sophisticated feature of current \nsocial reality.\u201913 There is evidence, first, of the continued relevance, as a consequence of \nthe neo-conservative discourses underpinning Government policy, of coercive \ntechnologies to control those troublesome groups unwilling or unable to engage in \nregulated freedom.14 Second, Stenson in particular argues that advanced liberal crime \ncontrol increasingly deploys forms of rule designed to resist challenges to the state\u2019s \nsovereignty over various political and geographical territories.15 \nThe paper deliberately adopts the methodology of \u2018discursive governmentality\u2019,16 \nwhich relies upon textual analysis for its understanding of the rationalities and \ntechnologies of advanced liberal governance. On the one hand, it examines the political \ndiscourses behind youth anonymity in England and Wales as expressed by New Labour. \nAccordingly, it employs Government policy documents, ministerial statements and \nformal guidance on the use of publicity to support its claims about the changing central \ngovernment rationalities underpinning the control of youth crime and their impact upon \ngovernance through anonymity. However, recognising that the operation of the right to \nanonymity is regulated by law as well as politics, the paper also explores the legal \ninfrastructure behind the right to anonymity, and its role in providing \u2018authorization\u201917 \nfor these governmental techniques or, as Tadros puts it, its importance as \u2018an interface \nthrough which governmental decisions can take effect by adjusting the operations and \narrangements of the disciplinary mechanisms\u2019.18 Thus, the paper engages in a \ngenealogy of the right to anonymity, following its inception in the 1933 Act, through \nlegislative reform and judicial precedents on its appropriate implementation, together \nwith the treatment under the Human Rights Act of ASBO publicity released by public \nauthorities.  \n                                                 \n13 Stenson, op. cit. n. 11, p. 63. \n14 M.

Tadros, \u2018Between governance and discipline: the law and Michel Foucault\u2019 (1998) 18(1) Oxford \nJournal of Legal Studies 75 at 79.  \n 4\nIt is, of course, important to recognise from the outset the limitations inherent in \nthe methodology of discursive governmentality. Concentrating in this way upon the \nrationalities operating at the highest level of governance; the political and \njurisprudential discourses of national government and the higher courts, my analysis \ninevitably fails to consider effectively the complex ways in which technologies of \ngovernance are implemented at the level of the local. Foucault has often been criticised \nfor failing to recognise the possibility of resistance in his work on discipline.19  This \npaper, on the other hand, explores the potential for reinterpretation of advanced liberal \nrationalities, and modification of the operation of technologies such as the ASBO, by \nboth local agencies of social control (for instance, the local executive agency, or the trial \njudge deciding on the merits of their applications for an order) and the ASBO subject \nhim or herself.  \nThe paper therefore accepts that, to meaningfully appreciate the potential for \nresistance to the rationalities and technologies of governance operating around the \nASBO subject, further analysis in this field must move towards what Stenson terms \n\u2018realist governmentality\u2019, which \u2018[supplements] discourse analysis of mentalities with \ngrounded, empirical, realist analysis of governing practices, and [draws] on both bodies \nof theory and research,\u201920 in order to better understand the practical distribution of \npower around the ASBO subject. Nevertheless, as an initial attempt to unravel the \ncomplex (and seemingly contradictory) mentalities in this area of law, and given the \ninevitable limitations of space, my discursive focus upon \u2018high\u2019 politics and law \nprovides, in my opinion, a useful starting-point for further socio-legal analysis in this \narea. Moreover, every effort has been made to ensure that empirical research is used, \nwhere available, to shed light upon the realities of local implementation. \n \n1. A GENEALOGY OF YOUTH ANONYMITY \n \nDiscourses of mainstream criminal justice, drawing upon the classical construction of \nthe rational, free-willed subject, tend to emphasise the importance of accountability, and \npunishment, of individuals for wrongdoing. However, state governance of low-level \nyouth disorder has been affected to a greater degree by the tenets of what criminologists \nterm welfarism.21 In fact, it is possible to identify two strands of welfarism that have \n                                                 \n19 L.

Consequently, discourses of \nvulnerability temper (though never fully replace) those of blame, and legislative \nmeasures are often enacted to facilitate effective support for young offenders\u2019 needs. As \nParton explains: \nA major assumption of welfarism is that, apart for a very small number, because \nthe depraved are essentially deprived or misguided, everyone is treatable or can \nbe rehabilitated.24  \nOver much of the last century, youth justice in England and Wales was \ncompartmentalised and reconfigured under a welfarist criminology of the other as a \ngateway to the burgeoning welfare state, with young offenders subject to the growing \nexpertise of its agencies and professionals. These developments, of course, reached their \nhigh-water mark during the 1960s with the enactment of the 1969 Children and Young \nPersons Act, designed to remove young offenders wholly from the criminal justice \nsystem and into the hands of the social work profession.25  \nIt is often assumed that the rise of welfarism reflects the compassionate and \nhumanitarian zeal of early 20th century reformers, \u2018child savers\u2019, dedicated altruistically \nto the protection of young people. An alternative perspective, however, is propounded \nby revisionist theorists, such as Foucault, who conversely explain the rise of the \nexpertise and practices of welfarism as a mechanism of control. In particular, they argue \n                                                 \n22 Garland, op. cit. n. 3, p. 137. \n23 B.

As \nStenson explains:  \nIt is possible to see the role of social work in trying to extend the practical and \ninner capacities of citizenship, as part of a wider spread of governmental power, \nbased on surveillance and moving beyond the institutional sites of the prison, \nschool and so on into the wider society.26  \nRather than mere altruism, social work developed around the young offender to prevent \nthe loss of otherwise valuable human resource to criminality; what Donzelot describes \nas \u2018the squandering of vital forces, the unused or useless individuals\u2019.27 Accordingly, a \n\u2018tutelary complex\u2019 grew up in an effort to overcome the social and individual \npathologies of both young offenders and their families.28  \nThe principle of youth anonymity in England and Wales arose as part of a host of \nearly 20th century welfarist reforms. Given legal weight, first, by the 1908 Children Act, \nthen the consolidating 1933 Act and more recently the Youth Justice and Criminal \nEvidence Act 1999 (\u2018the 1999 Act\u2019), it provides protection from media scrutiny to \nyoung people under eighteen involved in both civil and criminal legal proceedings. It \nhas received scant attention from commentators, however; apparently accepted without \nquestion as a necessary component of child welfare. Nevertheless, as with other \ncomponents of welfarist youth justice policy, the principle might be analysed \nstraightforwardly as another example of the altruism of early welfarist legislators. One \nmight suppose it was designed to shield young people from the harm that they would \notherwise suffer from association with particular legal proceedings. Historically, young \noffenders received the strongest legal protections given, one might assume, the \nparticularly strong social stigma that accompanies publicity of criminal proceedings, \nand the consequent possibility of physical harm through vigilantism or the \npsychological damage caused by social exclusion. Moreover, unlike adult offenders, in \nrelation to whom \u2018the unspoken premise seems to be that being named in the newspaper \nis a part of the sanction,\u201929 the perceived moral non-responsibility of children would \nhave rendered problematic the justice of publicity as punishment.  \n                                                 \n26 K.

Spencer, \u2018Naming and shaming young offenders\u2019 (2000) 59(3) Cambridge LJ 466 at 466. \n 7\nIt is contended, however, following the revisionists, that the right to anonymity is \nexplainable not simply as an act of legislative altruism, but simultaneously as a \ntechnology of social control: the principle must be reconsidered as an ethopolitical \nstrategy. Specifically, I would argue, it was the \u2018discovery\u2019 of the impact of \u2018labelling\u2019 \nupon young people by positive criminologists in the post-war period that provided \nideological support for its role in their governance.30  \nAdvocates of labelling theory argue that formal or informal classifications of \nyoung people as deviant encourages those individuals to actively reject moral norms \nand descend into more serious criminality. In governmental terms, at the heart of this \n\u2018ethopolitics of labelling\u2019 are both welfarist criminologies of everyday life and the \nother. Troublesome youth are either judged naturally equipped to engage eventually in \nresponsible freedom, or else \u2018pathological\u2019 but reformable through the disciplinary \nprocesses of social work. In either case, their inevitable progress to effective self-\ngovernance is threatened by the process of negative classification. In its hey-day during \nthe 1960s and 1970s, the ethopolitics of labelling had a considerable impact upon the \ngovernance of low-level youth disorder in England and Wales, contributing to the \nwelfarist rationality (displaced, as we will see, by New Labour\u2019s Respect agenda) that \nformal intervention by the criminal justice system to control troublesome conduct \nshould be avoided wherever possible.31 The right to anonymity was a key component of \nthis governmental strategy, designed to shield the subject from the particular stigma of \ncommunity disapproval which might otherwise reinforce the subject\u2019s self-conception \nas deviant. \nNevertheless, the principle of youth anonymity has been confronted since its \ninception by competing discourses promoting the value of publicity of legal \nproceedings. Historically, the predominant challenge has been that posed by classical, \nrather than advanced liberal, rule and its abstract, constitutional concern with the \ndefence of individual freedom against state tyranny. Importance tends to be placed, \nparticularly, upon the principle of open justice. As Lord Bingham of Cornhill has \nwritten in curia, \u2018it is a hallowed principle that justice is administered in public, open to \nfull and fair reporting of court proceedings so that the public may be informed about the \njustice administered in their name\u2019.32 That a balance was struck, from the outset, \n                                                 \n30 E. Lemert, Social Pathology: A Systematic Approach to the Theory of Sociopathic Behaviour (1951); \nH. S. Becker, Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance (1963).  \n31 Labelling theory within the academy, and consequent calls for a retraction of formal intervention in \nyouth crime, reached its criminological peak in the 1970s with the publication of Schur\u2019s Radical Non-\nIntervention (1973). \n32 McKerry v Teesdale and Wear Valley Justices [2001] EMLR 5 at 3. \n 8\nbetween classical and welfarist rationalities in law explains why youth anonymity has \nbeen seldom afforded as an unconditional right. In civil trials and criminal trials not \nbefore the Youth Court, for example, there has always been a presumption in favour of \npublicity (now regulated by section 39 of the 1933 Act and section 45 of the 1999 Act \nrespectively). Before the Youth Court, there was originally an absolute prohibition on \npublicity under the 1933 Act, reflecting the importance placed upon protecting the \nyoung offender. However, subsection 49(4A), introduced by the 1997 Crime \n(Sentences) Act, now provides courts with the power to overturn that presumption if \nthey judge that to do so would be in the public interest.  \nIt is the particular interface between the right to anonymity and the ASBO that \nconcerns us here, of course. Specifically, it is the contention of this paper that recent \npolitical and legal challenges to the principle provide an interesting example of many of \nthe characteristics of advanced liberal crime control identified by the governmentality \nschool. First, though, an explanation of the nature of these challenges to the principle is \nrequired. Since the creation of the ASBO, the right to anonymity, as it applies to the \nASBO subject, has faced a sustained assault by New Labour. The first evidence of \nGovernment concerns was political. In 2001, Jack Straw, the then Home Secretary was \nreported as claiming that:  \nThere may be grounds for imposing reporting restrictions during application \nproceedings concerning a juvenile, but in my view the situation changes if an \nASBO is made.33  \nHe then proceeded to suggest that there should, in fact, be a presumption in favour of \npublicity in such circumstances. Subsequently, this position found its way into official \npolicy, in the form of Home Office guidance which now explicitly advocates the \nidentification of the ASBO subject as part of a post-application media strategy. ASBO \npublicity involving young people, it demands, is to be the norm rather than the \nexception.34  \nWhat began as a political problematization, however, developed quickly into a \nlegal one, with criticism levelled eventually at the anonymity rights granted by the 1933 \nAct. It soon became clear to the Government that the structure of the legislation \nhindered the pursuit of greater publicity of the ASBO subject. Application for an \noriginal, or \u2018stand alone\u2019 ASBO is sought before the magistrates\u2019 court, and as such \nsection 39 applies to these proceedings, creating a presumption in favour of publicity. In \n                                                 \n33 P. Humphries, \u2018Shame faced\u2019, The Guardian, 24 October 2001. \n34 Home Office, Guidance on Publicising Anti-social Behaviour Orders (2005), p. 2. \n 9\na number of other ASBO proceedings, however, it was section 49 (which reverses this \npresumption), rather than section 39, that governed the right to anonymity. Section 49 \napplied to the \u2018CRASBO\u2019 imposed following a criminal conviction,35 together with \nbreach proceedings, where those proceedings take place before the Youth Court. The \nGovernment sought accordingly to reform the law in these areas. The 2003 Anti-social \nBehaviour Act revoked section 49 for the purpose of proceedings for a CRASBO \nbrought before the Youth Court, while the 2005 Serious Organised Crime and Police \nAct replaced it in breach proceedings.36 The upshot is that all ASBO proceedings are \nnow governed by section 39 of the 1933 Act.  \nBoth the Government\u2019s political demands for greater use of publicity and the \nlegal changes made to the 1933 Act have attracted the strident criticism of \ncommentators including Professor Rod Morgan, ex-chairman of the Youth Justice \nBoard, Al Aynsley-Green, the Children\u2019s Commissioner and Alvaro Gil-Robles, the \nprevious Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe.37 The anger of \nParliamentarians too is evident in the debates over the anonymity reforms contained in \nboth the Anti-social Behaviour and Serious Organised Crime and Police Bills.38 \nNotably, Baroness Stern argued, in that context, that the Government had shown itself  \nwilling, by sleight of hand, to throw in the rubbish bin the perceived wisdom of \nall those who care for the rights of children and who fought for them for nearly \ntwo centuries.39 \nIn each case, welfarist discourses (notably, tending to take the form of altruistic rather \nthan governmental arguments) continue to pose a political challenge to the dismantling \nof the principle of youth anonymity. \nImportantly, criticism has refocused, particularly, upon the impact of labelling. \nElizabeth Burney, for instance, has warned that  \n[t]he practical arguments in favour of publicising ASBOs notwithstanding, the \npractice is likely to be particularly harmful where young people are involved, as \nwell as unwise.  \nShe continues \u2018shame by itself, without any reintegrating process is likely to be counter-\nproductive, resulting in rejection of the ethical standpoint of the accusers\u2019.40 In line with \n                                                 \n35 CDA 1998, s. 1C. \n36 SOCPA, s. 141. \n37 C.

She raises an altruistic concern, on the one hand, that publicity \nmay harm the ASBO subject by encouraging his or her social exclusion. On the other, \nhowever, she warns that publicity will prove not only harmful but \u2018unwise\u2019, implying a \ngovernmental concern that labelling, exacerbated by publicity, impacts negatively upon \nefforts to either safeguard the subject\u2019s natural capacity for ethical self-governance, or \nelse undermines his or her effective reconstruction through social work.    \nThis article explores the rationale behind the Government\u2019s desire for greater \npublicity of the ASBO subject. In doing so, it explains its problematization of youth \nanonymity in terms of the often complex and contradictory rationalities and \ntechnologies underpinning the governance of \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019 in England and \nWales. The first part of our genealogy of youth anonymity has shown that challenges to \nthe principle stemmed, historically, from an abstract, constitutional demand for open \njustice. Alternatively, I argue below that the current assault against the principle in the \nASBO context clearly reflects the concerns of advanced liberal forms of rule. I contend \nfurther that the justifications for ASBO publicity provide a valuable illustration of the \ncomplex synchronic relationship between sovereign, disciplinary and governmental \nmentalities within advanced liberal governance. There are three parts to the analysis. \nThe first part seeks to ascertain the reasons for the fall of anonymity of the ASBO subject \nas a governmental technique, while the second and third parts analyze the simultaneous \nrise of governance of that subject through publicity. \n \n2. NEO-CONSERVATISM AND THE FALL OF YOUTH ANONYMITY  \n \nUltimately, the fall of anonymity of the ASBO subject is best explained as a corollary to \ncontemporary challenges to the expertise and practices of welfarism under advanced \nliberal rule.41 Members of the governmentality school tend to argue that the rationalities \nand technologies of advanced liberalism are the product of neo-liberal politics. This \npaper suggests, instead, that the governance of \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019 cannot be \nunderstood without reference to the role of the residual moralism of neo-conservatism \n                                                                                                                                               \n40 Burney, op. cit. n. 8, p. 97. See, also, the use of labelling theory by Rod Morgan (S. Goodchild, \n\u2018Demonised: We lock them up. We give them ASBOs. But is our fear of kids making them worse?\u2019, The \nIndependent, 23 April 2006) and in written responses to the Home Affairs Select Committee (Report into \nAnti-social Behaviour (2005), para. 131).  \n41 Exemplified by the claim of Louise Casey, director of the Government\u2019s Anti-social Behaviour Unit, \nthat \u2018youth workers, social workers and the liberal intelligentsia\u2019 who had attacked the ASBO were \u2018not \nliving in the real world\u2019: L. Ward, \u2018ASBO chief rounds on liberal critics\u2019, The Guardian, 10 June 2005.  \n 11\nin the reconstruction of the characteristics of \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth.42  Neo-liberal and neo-\nconservative discourses are symptomatic of the rise of advanced liberal approaches to \nthe governance of crime and anti-social behaviour, and share one important \ncharacteristic: both encourage the transfer of responsibility for the governance of that \nconduct away from the state. Where the two discourses differ fundamentally, however, \nis the target of their respective responsibilization strategies. While neo-liberalism \nencourages the transfer of policing responsibilities from the state to agencies and \nindividuals within the private sphere (a process explored in greater detail below), neo-\nconservatism demands that the targets of crime control, including the ASBO subject, \ntake greater responsibility for their own troublesome conduct. This construction of the \noffender is particularly evident within the discourses underpinning the Respect agenda. \nWhile neo-conservatism has been repackaged to reflect the Government\u2019s ostensibly \ncommunitarian political philosophy,43 there is little difference, to my mind, between the \ntwo ideologies in terms of their understanding of the \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019 of young \npeople. \nNeo-conservatism challenges the knowledge claims of both welfarist \ncriminologies of everyday life and the other. Notwithstanding the former\u2019s construction \nof the \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth progressing inevitably towards responsible freedom, his neo-\nconservative counterpart is treated in no uncertain terms as other. As Squires explains, \nNew Labour clearly views anti-social behaviour not as normal adolescent conduct but \n\u2018the seedbed of delinquency, the beginning of a persistent offending career\u2019.44 However, \nthis criminology of the other is unlike its welfarist predecessor. In line with other \naspects of contemporary social policy, governance of youth anti-social behaviour is \nincreasingly (but not wholly) organised around neo-conservatism\u2019s moralistic aetiology \nof criminal conduct.45 Rose notes that under advanced liberal forms of rule:  \nThe pervasive image of the perpetrator of crime is not one of the juridical subject \nof the rule of law, nor that of the social and psychological subject of criminology, \nbut of the individual who has failed to accept his or her responsibilities as a \nsubject of moral community.46  \n                                                 \n42 P.

The neo-conservative criminology of the other \nframes anti-social behaviour in terms of disrespect and irresponsibility, rather than a \nnatural part of growing up, or a symptom of blameless pathology.  \nNeo-conservative reconstruction of the \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth has had important \nconsequences for the rationalities and technologies deployed in their governance. As we \nhave seen, the welfarist criminology of the other places a considerable degree of faith in \nthe ability of social work to normalize anti-social youth. Conversely, the move from an \nexplanation of the causes of anti-social behaviour focused in part upon pathology to one \ndefined in terms of an outright refusal to exercise responsible freedom leads inevitably \nto the conclusion that the disciplinary role of social work is governmentally irrelevant. \nThe source of appropriate governance of anti-social behaviour rests not with \nprofessional intervention but, instead, with the \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth him or herself. \nMoreover, the most appropriate way in which to govern the subject is assumed to be the \nresidual technologies of what Mitchell Dean terms \u2018authoritarian governmentality\u2019. \nDean recognises that, while the advanced liberal state has increasingly sought to \ngovern through subtle forms of disciplinary and ethopolitical technique, direct sovereign \nrule continues for \u2018certain populations held to be without the attributes of responsible \nfreedom.\u201947 He explores the ways in which crime control continues to rely upon \n\u2018despotic\u2019 forms of government where the subject has failed to engage in effective \nprocesses of ethical self-governance. He describes this as \u2018authoritarian \ngovernmentality, [or] \u2026 non-liberal and explicitly authoritarian types of rule that seek \nto operate through obedient rather than free subjects, or, at a minimum, endeavour to \nneutralize opposition to authority.\u201948 Neo-conservative discourse presumes that, rather \nthan independently exercising appropriate self-governance, or requiring the disciplinary \nintervention of social work, the ASBO subject has actively rejected the demand to \nexercise his inherent capacity for responsible freedom. Given this combination of \ncapacity, and unwillingness, to respond to ethopolitical exhortation, governance must be \ninstilled instead through the direct sovereign prohibition of the order\u2019s criminal \nsanction.49 \nThe neo-conservative rejection of the rationalities of welfarist criminologies of \neveryday life and the other is reinforced further by concomitant challenges to the \n                                                 \n47 M. Dean, op. cit. n. 14, p. 131. \n48 Id. \n49 Part of a new era of \u2018contractual governance\u2019: see A.

Neo-conservatism encourages an \nexclusionary rather than inclusionary approach towards the \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth subject. \nBecause anti-social behaviour by young people is treated as evidence of a rejection of \nthe moral norms of society, rather than part of growing up or pathology, society is \nabsolved of its welfarist moral obligations towards those individuals. As Rose writes, \nwithin neo-conservative discourse, \n[t]hose who refuse to become responsible, to govern themselves ethically, have \nalso refused the offer to become members of our moral community. Hence, for \nthem, harsh measures are entirely appropriate. Three strikes and you are out: \ncitizenship becomes conditional upon conduct.50  \nThus, the successful contemporary reconstruction of the ASBO subject as a symbol of a \ndepraved and dangerous youth underclass51 provides moral justification for the punitive \nand exclusionary potential of the order.52  \nSimilarly, neo-conservatism has had a fundamental impact upon the right to \nanonymity for the ASBO subject. Once again, the construction of the ASBO subject as \na morally degenerate other deals a blow to altruistic arguments for their protection from \nthe stigma associated with publicity by fostering a sense of justified indignation at their \napparent irresponsibility and disrespect. The shame that might ensue from publicity of \nanti-social behaviour is treated increasingly as a legitimate penalty for the ASBO \nsubject, in much the same way as an adult offender. Indeed, the right of the ASBO \nsubject to anonymity is viewed as a startling illustration of the degree to which the \nwelfarist state had become \u2018soft\u2019 on youth crime. Moreover, neo-conservatism poses an \napparently coherent challenge to the governmental objectives behind the right to \nanonymity. The Government\u2019s disconcerting silence on the issue of labelling should be \ntreated as an implicit neo-conservative rejection of this welfarist ethopolitical strategy.  \nIt is, of course, fairly unsurprising that New Labour would be reluctant to \nentertain an ethopolitics of labelling. As we have seen, the theory advocates that formal \ncriminal justice measures should be avoided whenever possible in the governance of \n\u2018anti-social\u2019 youth. Conversely, neo-conservatism dictates that it is not the intervention \nof the criminal justice system into the lives of \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth, but its historic failure \n                                                 \n50 Rose, op. cit. n. 2, p. 267. \n51 H. Davis and M. Bourhill, \u2018\u201cCrisis\u201d: the demonization of children and young people\u2019 in Scraton, op. cit. \nn. 28. \n52 The neo-conservative claim that the authoritarian governance of the ASBO is an effective way to \nmaintain control over populations is of course contentious. Recent empirical research reveals that the \nASBO breach rate has risen to over 50 per cent: National Audit Office, Tackling Anti-social Behaviour, \nHC 99 Session 2006-2007 (2006), p. 19; Policy Research Bureau and NACRO, Anti-social Behaviour \nOrders (2006). \n 14\nto intervene, that has led to an apparently pervasive youth culture of disrespect and \nirresponsibility.  Consequently, the Respect agenda has brought low level disorder by \nyoung people within the net of the criminal justice system, responding to it instead \nthrough the authoritarian governmentality of formal, sovereign processes of \nenforcement such as the ASBO. \nMore importantly, neo-conservatism also challenges the knowledge claims of \nlabelling theory. I have argued that the ethopolitics of labelling depends for its power as \na rationality upon a particular, welfarist construction of \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth. It assumes \nthat the youth ASBO subject is both capable of and willing to exercise responsible \nfreedom, achievable either independently or, where the conduct is deemed pathological, \nwith the support of the disciplinary processes of social work. The ultimate concern of an \nethopolitics of labelling is that a young person\u2019s inevitable progress to responsible \nfreedom will be undermined by the countervailing processes of community stigma \narising from publicity, encouraging the \u2018anti-social\u2019 subject to actively reject those \nmoral norms. Yet labelling theory fails under a neo-conservative reconstruction of the \nASBO subject. Rather than progressing steadily towards appropriate ethical self-\ngovernance, the neo-conservative youth subject is assumed to have already rejected \noutright society\u2019s moral demands. Thus, he is positioned, not as a subject at risk of \ndescent from circuits of inclusion to circuits of exclusion,53 but one operating firmly \nwithin those latter circuits from the outset. Accordingly, stripped of its original \npreventative welfarist rationale, the governmental possibilities of anonymity can be \nincreasingly ignored.   \n \n3. THE RISE OF YOUTH PUBLICITY AS AN ETHOPOLITICAL TECHNOLOGY \n \nThus far, I have argued that the perceived value of anonymity, as an ancillary \nmechanism designed to protect young offenders from the impact of community stigma \nfor both altruistic and governmental reasons, has been undermined by neo-conservative \nrepresentations of the ASBO subject. It is the further contention of this section that the \n(at least partial) movement from welfarism to advanced liberal forms of rule within \nyouth justice policy has ensured not only the fall of anonymity, but the simultaneous \nrise of publicity in the governance of the ASBO subject. In 2006, the Home Office \nreleased guidance to practitioners on ASBO publicity, setting out a number of \njustifications for its use: enforcement of the order; public reassurance about safety; \n                                                 \n53 Rose, op. cit., n. 6. \n 15\npublic confidence in local services; deterrence to perpetrators and deterrence to others.54 \nThese justifications provide the basis for the following analysis, which highlights how \npublicity of the ASBO subject as a governmental technology confirms much of the \nrecent work of the governmentality school on the current state of advanced liberal crime \ncontrol policies. In particular, the justifications reflect the Labour government\u2019s broader \nneo-liberal efforts to harness the governmental potential of \u2018responsibilized \ncommunities\u2019.55  \nNumerous commentators have explored the implication of communities in \nadvanced liberal governmental strategies.56 Indeed, notwithstanding the inherent \nambiguity of the term, New Labour\u2019s focus upon the community colours its own brand \nof neo-conservative politics; communitarianism, providing an apparent compromise \nbetween the rampant individualism of Thatcherism and the wholesale public provision \nof the social. In particular, the governmentality school note the expectations \nincreasingly placed upon the community in terms of its crime control responsibilities.57 \nFlint contends that the ethopolitics of responsibilized community are based upon two \nbroad assumptions: \nFirst, that neighbourhood or community processes themselves impact on levels of \ndisorder, and second, that there is a need to re-establish norms of behaviour and \nvalues held in common between citizens. Community therefore becomes both a \nterritory and a means of governing crime and disorder.58  \nAs the following sections explain, there are two ways in which publicity operates to \nharness the governmental potential of responsibilized community. An ethopolitical \nstrategy exists to improve communities by engaging them in surveillance of the ASBO, \nwhile communities are also implicated in the ASBO subject\u2019s own self-governance as \npart of a developing ethopolitics of shame. \n \n(a) Governing through community: the ethopolitics of surveillance \n \n                                                 \n54 Home Office, op. cit. n. 34, p. 2. \n55 J.

This is no more evident than community policing strategies, including \nmost recently the governance of \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019. Indeed, the ASBO is itself a \nclear example of the responsibilization of agencies beyond the formal criminal justice \nsystem: it was designed not only for the use of police authorities, but also local \nauthorities and social landlords.60 Following the enactment of the Serious Organized \nCrime and Police Act 2005, the Government is now also able to add to the list of \nrelevant agencies by statutory instrument,61 and empower local authorities to contract \nout their ASBO functions to specified private organisations.62 \nAs O\u2019Malley and Palmer note, \u2018one set of aims and effects of community policing \nmay be to co-opt the population in processes of routine surveillance, and to increase the \nflow of information coming to the police\u2019.63 This surveillance aspect of community \nresponsibilization is particularly evident around the ASBO. Its efficacy as a sovereign \nform of rule clearly depends upon enforcement of its terms, necessitating intensive \noversight of the young person subject to the order. However, orders often cover wide \ngeographical areas and a broad range of behaviour, and as such the police and local \nauthorities are unlikely to have the resources required to patrol each and every possible \nbreach. It is unsurprising, then, that the community has been recognised by the \nGovernment as key to the policing of the ASBO, allowing continuous, informal \nsurveillance of the order.64 Most telling, perhaps, is Campbell\u2019s conclusion, based upon \nempirical research on the operation of the order, that local agencies themselves view \n                                                 \n59 Rose, op. cit. n. 5, p. 335. \n60 CDA 1998, s. 1. \n61 CDA 1998, s. 1A. The list was recently extended in this way to include the Environment Agency and \nTransport for London: Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (Relevant Authorities and Relevant Persons) Order \n2006. \n62 CDA 1998, s. 1F. The Government has recently proposed to allow local authorities to contract out these \nresponsibilities to private organizations that manage their social housing: Draft Local Authorities \n(Contracting out of Anti-social Behaviour Order Functions) (England) Order 2007. It also plans to extend \nthese powers to include Tenant Management Organisations (TMOs), private tenant-led institutions \ngranted powers to part-manage social housing: Department of Communities and Local Government, \n\u2018Press release: new powers for tenants to tackle anti-social behaviour \u2013 Kelly\u2019, 9 January 2007, p. 2. \n63 O\u2019Malley and Palmer, op. cit. n. 57, p. 137. A contemporary example is the increasingly complex \nrelations between private, municipal and public forms of visible policing: A. Crawford, S. Lister, S. \nBlackburn and J. Burnett, Plural Policing: The Mixed Economy of Visible Patrols in England and Wales \n(2005). \n64 Home Office, op. cit. n.  34, p. 2. \n 17\npublicity as important \u2018because it [spreads] the responsibility of enforcement around the \ncommunity\u2019,65 capturing perfectly the neo-liberal rationalities behind the appeal to \ncommunities in this context.  \nOn one analysis, then, the extension of responsibility for surveillance of the \nASBO to communities is a straightforward example of neo-liberal responsibilization, \nwith \u2018members of the public being constituted as competent and skilled agents\u2019 of crime \ncontrol.66 It appears, however, that the governmental mentalities behind this particular \nprocess of responsibilization are broader than this. As Flint notes, community is viewed \nsimultaneously as both a ready source of governmental power and a target for \nethopolitical strategies. Indeed, behind the responsibilization strategy once can identify \na desire not only to better govern the ASBO subject, but additionally to better govern \nthe community itself. The Home Office guidance states that  \nASBOs are community-based orders that involve local people not only in the \ncollection of evidence but also in helping to enforce breaches. By their nature \nthey encourage local communities to become actively involved in reporting crime \nand disorder and contributing actively to building and protecting the \ncommunity.67  \nHere, the Government confirms explicitly that the surveillance role of the community is \npart of a more general ethopolitical strategy to create an \u2018active citizenry\u2019 willing and \ncapable of civic engagement; part of its commitment to what it terms civil renewal.68  \nIn 2004, Alvaro Gil-Robles, the previous Commissioner for Human Rights of the \nCouncil of Europe, assessed the human rights implications of the ASBO. Recognising \nthat responsibility for the surveillance of the ASBO had been passed to communities, he \nstates: \u2018I cannot help but be somewhat uneasy over [the] transfer of policing duties to \nlocal residents\u2019.69 He makes no further attempt to elaborate upon his concerns. I would \nmake two observations, however, about the possible negative repercussions of \nresponsibilization of communities in this context. On the one hand, given that the need \nfor effective enforcement of the ASBO through publicity involves a direct trade-off with \nthe right to anonymity, Gil-Robles\u2019 fears may spring partly from a welfarist \nconstruction of the ASBO subject as vulnerable and a concomitant belief in youth \nanonymity as an altruistic and governmental necessity. On the other, a further criticism \nmight be levelled at the Government\u2019s specific adoption of surveillance as an \n                                                 \n65 S.

Prior has \nrecently challenged the apparently inevitable benefits of active citizenry and civil \nrenewal. As he forewarns: \nThere may be inherent flaws in this conceptualisation of a virtuous spiral \ninvolving the agendas of civil renewal and community safety, because the latter is \nas likely to generate relationships based on suspicion as it is those based on trust. \n\u2026 [C]ertain forms of community safety initiative are likely to reproduce and \npossibly exacerbate inherent dynamics of social exclusion that exist within \ncommunities.70 \nArguably, the Government\u2019s ethopolitics of surveillance, encouraged by publicity of the \nASBO subject, pits the community against the ASBO subject in a relationship of mutual \nsuspicion. As such, it has the potential to promote an active citizenry of a firmly neo-\nconservative, exclusionary bent. \n \n(b) Governing through community: the ethopolitics of shame \n \nRose describes ethopolitical strategies as operating \u2018through the self-steering forces of \nhonour and shame, or propriety, obligation, trust, fidelity, and commitment to others\u2019.71 \nHarnessing these internal processes is central to advanced liberal efforts to govern, from \na distance, by encouraging a subject\u2019s own powers of ethical self-improvement. The \ngovernmental efficacy of shame, like each of these ethopolitical processes, requires \nsubjects to be bound by what Vaughan terms an \u2018emotional attachment\u2019 to \u2018appropriate \n\u201cwebs of belonging\u2019\u2019\u2019.72 Increasingly, it is one\u2019s community that has been identified as \nthe territory within which those webs can be found, and, accordingly, where an \nethopolitics of shame must necessarily take place. Indeed, in line with these \ndevelopments, the following section explores how the granting of an ASBO is expected \nto encourage the ASBO subject, through shame, to work on themselves and align \nthemselves again with the norms of the community. Publicity, in this context, is \nintended to intensify the ethopolitical power of shame through the widest possible \ntransmission of the ASBO subject\u2019s details and offending conduct.  \nShame as a governmental technique appears to be a fairly uncontroversial \nethopolitical objective in relation to adult offenders. For instance, Spencer implicitly \n                                                 \n70 D.

It is contended, however, that in an advanced liberal \nera, in which the role of welfare within youth justice policy has been increasingly \nundermined, shame is now viewed within certain political discourse as an appropriate \ntechnique for the governance not only of adults but children too. Indeed, the evidence \nsuggests that shame is a technology employed increasingly by local agencies as part of \ntheir ASBO strategies. For example, Medway Council recently admitted before the \nHigh Court that it had deliberately employed publicity in order to shame a 13-year-old \nASBO subject.74 Notable too is Guildford council\u2019s \u2018wall of shame\u2019 on which images of \nASBO recipients are projected.75  \nIt is perhaps surprising, then, that in its guidance on the use of publicity the \nGovernment has explicitly refused to acknowledge the role of shame as a governmental \ntechnique: \u2018[p]ublicity is not intended to punish, shame or embarrass the individual\u2019.76 \nThe Government\u2019s recalcitrance in advocating an ethopolitics of shame appears strange, \ngiven its own neo-conservative construction of the ASBO subject as other, and the \nconcomitant punitive discourses that underpin other aspects of its anti-social behaviour \npolicies. Indeed, I believe that in reality the valorisation of shame fits the Government\u2019s \nown communitarian sensibilities. However, I would suggest that its apparent rejection \nof this governmental technique could simply reflect a pragmatic concern that explicit \nadvocacy of the shaming of the ASBO subject would simply be too Draconian for many \nmembers of the electorate to accept, persuading it to emphasise the more rational \nobjective of effective public surveillance of the order instead. If so, the decision \nillustrates the continued possibility of a role for welfarist resistance in policy formation; \nan issue returned to in the final part of this paper. It also highlights the limits of the \npredominantly textual approach of this paper, perhaps leaving hidden much of the true \nnature of the rationalities and technologies operating around the ASBO subject.  \nNevertheless, notwithstanding the Government\u2019s own rhetoric, the law, as the \nauthorizer of governmental techniques, has taken a different approach to the regulation \n                                                 \n73 Spencer, op. cit., n. 29, p. 466. \n74 Medway Council v BBC [2002] 1 FLR 104, para. 6. \n75 Squires with Stephen, op. cit. n. 9, p. 523. \n76 Home Office, op. cit. n. 34, p. 2. \n 20\nof the right to anonymity under the 1933 Act. In the leading case of T v St Albans \nCrown Court,77 the High Court considered the factors that a judge could appropriately \ntake into account when deciding whether a section 39 order, guaranteeing the \nanonymity of the ASBO subject, should be granted. In so doing, Elias J commended the \nearlier pronouncement of Simon Brown LJ that:  \nThe prospect of being named in court with the accompanying disgrace is a \npowerful deterrent and the naming of defendant in the context of his punishment \nserves as a deterrent to others. These deterrents are proper objectives for the court \nto seek.78 \nFollowing this precedent, he concluded that \u2018as far as shaming may, and often will, have \na legitimate deterrent effect, it is a relevant factor to weigh against its potential adverse \neffect.\u201979 Shame, then, has been authorised by law as a technology of rule, \nnotwithstanding both the Government\u2019s refusal to countenance its use, broader welfarist \nconcerns with its exclusionary effects, and its questionable effectiveness as a \ngovernmental technique.  \nThese judicial developments provide an important insight into the role that law \nplays, independently of politics, in the formation of mentalities of governance. Simon \nBrown LJ\u2019s assumption about the value of shame \u2013 its position as a \u2018powerful tool\u2019 - \nillustrates the law\u2019s position as a particularly dominant source of expertise in the \nconstruction of \u2018truths\u2019 about the appropriate subjectification of the target of \ngovernance. Moreover, it highlights how, through the process of legal precedence, this \nknowledge can transfer to the governance of new subjects (in this case, the target of an \nASBO) without the need for reconsideration of its relevance in the new context. Indeed, \nwhat is interesting is the absence of even the most basic evidence to support Simon \nBrown LJ\u2019s claim. Consequently, the law has been able to authorize an absolute \nrejection of the ethopolitics of labelling in favour of the neo-conservative \u2018common-\nsense\u2019 of shame, notwithstanding that it is, in reality, of debatable value according to \nother expert discourses. \nBefore proceeding, I want to note finally an interesting implication of the move \ntowards community-based governance of the ASBO subject for our genealogy of youth \nanonymity. As contended from the outset, the rise of anonymity as a governmental \ntechnology was, in part, an attempt by the welfare liberal state to restrict the operation \nof community-based processes as they relate to the young offender, as it was perceived \n                                                 \n77 [2002] EWHC 1129.  \n78 R v Winchester Crown Court, ex parte B [2000] 1 Cr App R 11 at 13. \n79 [2002] EWHC 1129, para. 22. \n 21\nthat these processes, in the form of community stigma, would undermine their progress \nto responsible freedom, by classifying them as deviant. Yet now, as a consequence of \nthe neo-liberal rationalities underpinning advanced liberalism, community (rather than \nthe state) has been elevated to a prominent role in the governance of the ASBO subject. \nRather than attempting to remove the ASBO subject from the disciplinary circuits of \ncommunities, the latter has become now an integral component of his or her control. \nThe welfarist ethopolitics of labelling, fearful of the governmental processes of \ncommunity, have been superseded by the advanced liberal ethopolitics of shame, with \nthose processes at its core. \nYet once again, notwithstanding the growing acceptance of an ethopolitics of \nshame, its value as a technique for the governance of the ASBO subject is contentious. \nOne concern is that communities may well not be able to impose the necessary \u2018webs of \nbelonging\u2019 within which the behaviour of the ASBO subject can be contained. There is \na tendency under neo-liberalism to construct communities idealistically as inherently \ncapable of effective self-regulation, if only they were allowed do to so by an \noverbearing state. John Flint, however, argues convincingly that all too often the \nnecessary social capital required to do so is unavailable in the deprived communities \nmost in need of the power of governance over its members.80 Either the required social \ncohesion no longer exists within a community, or it exists but an absence of collective \nefficacy prevents it from being deployed. Indeed, Flint contends that it was the fact that \nthe appeal to responsibilized communities proved so unsuccessful in the areas suffering \nfrom the most debilitating forms of anti-social behaviour that forced the Government to \nresort to direct intervention through, inter alia, the ASBO.  \nThe ethopolitics of shame may also prove ineffectual because many ASBO \nsubjects are governed not by the disapproving community, but by competing \ngovernmental forces operating at the local level. As noted earlier, Stenson recognises, as \npart of his focus upon the continued relevance of sovereign rule under advanced \nliberalism, that the governors of nation states have found their sovereignty increasingly \nchallenged by competing forces, both supra- and sub-national. He explains that, at the \nsub-national level, \nethnic, religious, criminal and other sites of governance in civil society do more \nthan resist state power. They have their own agendas of governance, forms of \n                                                 \n80 Flint, op. cit. n. 57, p. 254. \n 22\nknowledge and expertise deployed to govern and maintain solidarity in and over \ntheir own territories and populations.81 \nAccordingly, sovereign forms of governance are often employed to reinstate control \nover particular political and geographical spaces.82 Returning to the specific ethopolitics \nof shame, it might be argued that in certain circumstances the ASBO subject will be \ngoverned more successfully by the competing forces of what Stenson refers to as \u2018youth \nself-organization\u2019,83 or governance by his or her peer group. \nIndeed, evidence suggests that the ASBO subject could in fact be tied into the \ncompeting web of his or her peer group much more firmly than that of the disapproving \ncommunity. Resistance to the ethopolitics of shame as a consequence of the ASBO \nsubject\u2019s position within processes of youth self-organization may help to explain the \nconclusion of recent research into attitudes towards ASBOs among young people \ncarried out by NACRO and the Policy Research Bureau that both the imposition and \npublicising of an ASBO acts as a badge of honour, rather than shame, for certain \nindividuals.84  \nThat is not to say that shame is an inherently ineffective governmental technique. \nJohn Braithwaite, in his seminal research on governance through shame, argued \nconvincingly that shame can have positive consequences for social control.85 However, \nat the heart of Braithwaite\u2019s thesis was, of course, the fundamental distinction drawn \nbetween disintegrative and reintegrative forms of shaming. Only the latter approach, in \nwhich concerted efforts are made to integrate the subject back within appropriate \u2018webs \nof belonging\u2019, will succeed in harnessing the ethopolitical value of this powerful \nemotion. In the absence of reintegrative modes of shaming, as Schur once pointed out, \nthe exclusionary impact of labelling through publicity may simply reinforce the ASBO \nsubject\u2019s sense of association with other anti-social youth and consequently exacerbate \nthat conduct.86 Indeed, given the demonisation evident in increasingly sensationalist \nreporting of the ASBO subject, discussed below, the neo-conservative faith in publicity \n                                                 \n81 Stenson, op. cit. n. 16, p. 267. \n82 The ASBO is, of course, an excellent illustration of the fight for territorial control, permitting a court to \nexclude particular groups, such as drug-dealers, competing with police for sovereignty over physical \nspaces: see, for example, R (on the application of Kenny and M) v Leeds Magistrates\u2019 Court [2003] \nEWHC 2963. \n83 Stenson, op. cit. n. 16, p. 274. \n84 Policy Research Bureau and NACRO, op. cit., n. 53.

THE RISE OF YOUTH PUBLICITY AS A SOVEREIGN TECHNOLOGY \n \nStenson\u2019s reconsideration of sovereign rule reveals how governance is directed not only \ntowards the effective management of individuals and populations, but the control of \nterritory itself.87 The state has grown increasingly worried about its own governmental \nlimitations, particularly in the face of the pressures of globalisation, transfer of powers \nto supernational organisations such as the EU and competing claims by communal \ngroups seeking to govern certain populations from below, such as the forces of \u2018youth \nself-organization\u2019 discussed above. As David Garland recognises, one important way in \nwhich the state has sought to regain sovereign control over its political and geographical \nterritory (in terms of electoral success) has been the use of authoritarian crime control to \nconfirm its own authority; flexing its muscles to \u2018give the impression that something is \nbeing done \u2013 here now, swiftly and decisively\u2019.88 Thus, under advanced liberal rule, the \nsovereign governance of crime is both instrumental and expressive. \nExpressive forms of sovereign rule are clearly evident behind the politics of anti-\nsocial behaviour.89 As Squires notes, \u2018the Law and Order issue\u2019, of which the Respect \nagenda is central, has \u2018undoubtedly been the making of New Labour\u2019.90 Crawford adds \nthat,  \n[t]he current governmental preoccupation with petty crime, disorder and ASB \nreflects a sense of \u2018anxiety\u2019 about which something can be done in an otherwise \nuncertain world.91   \nImportantly, because the concept of anti-social behaviour is politically constructed, it \nprovides the Government with an opportunity to take control of the issue and define \nboth the problem and its solution, with the Respect agenda, \nin part at least, an attempt by government to engage directly in a politics of \nrepresentation about law, order and public safety, an attempt to influence public \nperceptions directly.92  \n                                                 \n87 Stenson, op. cit. n. 11. \n88 Garland, op. cit. n. 3, p. 135. \n89 I.

Stephens, Rougher Justice: Anti-social Behaviour and Young People (2005), p. 19. \n 24\nThe representation that the Government has sought to put forward is an image of a \nstrong state apparatus, capable of effectively tackling the problem of anti-social \nbehaviour, in order to reduce the fear of crime and, accordingly, reinforce its sovereign \nstate by securing the political faith of the electorate.  \nHughes and Follett argue that the ASBO is itself an illustration of expressive, as \nwell as instrumental, sovereign rule.93 The mechanism has proved highly mediagenic, \nrepresenting to the public the toughness of the Respect agenda, and indeed is viewed by \nthe Government as integral to its electoral success.94 Moreover, representations of the \nASBO are not simply valuable to national government. Local agencies too are able to \nsecure their own positions through displays of sovereign strength. The empirical work \nof Thomas et al supports this conclusion, suggesting that local agencies are often more \ninterested in using ASBOs to provide reassurance to the community, rather than \nbelieving that the order can really change behaviour.95 In many cases the external, \nexpressive objective of the order takes precedence then over its internal, ethopolitical \nvalue. Clearly, for the Government, publicity is vital to the successful deployment of the \nASBO as an expressive act of state sovereignty. As its guidance makes clear, publicity \nis further justified \u2018as a way to restore public confidence in local services\u2019.96 Publicity \nof the ASBO subject is viewed as a symbol of the power of local agencies to tackle not \nonly anti-social behaviour, but also their competence in all forms of public provision.  \nHowever, the pursuit of expressive forms of sovereignty poses inevitable \ngovernmental dangers. In its effort to shore up faith in national and local government \nthrough publicity, Labour has manipulated the fear and insecurity of the public. Yet, \nultimately it may find itself unable to meet the expectations it has created. Tonry \ncontends that  \nby making anti-social behaviour into a major social policy problem, and giving it \nsustained high visibility attention, Labour has made a small problem larger, \nthereby making people more aware of it and less satisfied with their lives and \ntheir government.97  \nIndeed, one might note the internal contradictions in the Government\u2019s own \njustifications for publicity of the ASBO subject.

Notwithstanding the continued \nevidence of welfarist discourses operating around the ASBO subject in practice, the \nGovernment is only tentatively willing \u2018to associate [itself] publicly with, and to \npromote, responses to offending that are not exclusively punitive\u2019.100 New Labour\u2019s war \nagainst anti-social behaviour has actually increased the public\u2019s fear of crime, while in \nreality crime rates continue to fall, threatening to create a \u2018punishment deficit\u2019 between \nsupply and demand of punishment at both national and local level.101 Moreover, \npublicity of the ASBO subject could encourage both local and national governments to \nmove even further towards authoritarian solutions to anti-social behaviour. Indeed, that \nthis may cause serious problems for the continued sovereignty of both national \ngovernment and local agencies is evident in Campbell\u2019s warning, following her \nempirical research into the use of ASBOs, that where local agencies engage in major \npublicity of orders granted in the area, \u2018[m]anaging the expectation such a campaign \nmay create is potentially problematic for partnerships\u2019.102 \n \n5. MOVING TOWARDS SENSATIONALISM? \n \nThis paper has contended that the deployment of publicity of the ASBO subject reflects \nthe simultaneous deployment of three components of advanced liberal rule. First, \npublicity seeks to responsibilize communities as agents of crime control, and to promote \nan ethopolitics of active citizenship, by encouraging surveillance of the ASBO. Second, \nand controversially, the courts have authorized publicity of the ASBO subject as part of \nan ethopolitics of shame. Third, and finally, publicity is viewed by national and local \ngovernment as a way to augment sovereign governance of the electorate, by reducing \ntheir fear of crime and consequently increasing faith in the state. In this final section I \nwant to draw together these components of publicity as governmental technology \u2013 \nsurveillance, sovereignty and shame - and conclude about their implications for the \n                                                 \n98 Home Office, op. cit. n. 34, p. 2. \n99 J. Jamieson, \u2018New Labour, youth justice and the question of \u201crespect\u201d\u2019 (2005) Youth Justice 180 at 186. \n100 Brownlee, op. cit, n. 89, p. 333. \n101 Id. \n102 Campbell, op. cit. n. 65, p. 81. \n 26\nASBO subject. My first point, very simply, is that anonymity will be increasingly \nwaived in ASBO proceedings under section 39. Neo-conservative constructions of the \nASBO subject undermining the altruistic and governmental role of anonymity, together \nwith the new justifications for publicity of the order, will inevitably impact upon \njudicial decision-making; an issue explored further in the following section. \nAdditionally, however, it is likely that publicity will contain increasingly \n\u2018sensationalist\u2019 representations of the ASBO subject. By sensationalism, I refer to \npublicity that reinforces the image of the ASBO subject as other through lurid \nreportage. Exploring this concept further, it is first necessary to identify two sources of \nASBO publicity. The first source is, of course, the private media, arising from its \ntraditional role in the reporting of legal proceedings. Harnessing the private media is \nparticularly important for local agencies, according to the Home Office guidance, \nbecause their wider distribution allows publicity to reach a large number of individuals \nwithin a community affected by anti-social behaviour. Interestingly, from a \ngovernmental perspective, the guidance adds that local agencies that impose ASBOs \nshould ensure that they actively engage in the governance of ASBO reportage by the \nprivate media. It points to the need to establish \u2018working relationships\u2019 with local media \noutlets, while emphasising the importance of close control of the material to ensure that \nthe well-being of witnesses and vulnerable defendants are not jeopardised by \nunsanctioned disclosures.103 However, it is important to recognise, secondly, that ASBO \npublicity is carried out not only by the private media but \u2018in-house\u2019 by the public (or \nquasi-public) agencies who actually impose the orders, in the form of leaflets and \nwebsite information distributed to local residents. \nI would argue that both these sources of publicity, private and public, are \nsusceptible to sensationalism, but for markedly different reasons. With respect to the \nprivate press, sensationalism is of course an inevitable consequence of the commercial \npressure to pursue newsworthy content that will attract readership and ensure maximum \nsales.104 Tabloid newspapers, in particular, tend to secure the attention of a prurient \nreadership by constructing the ASBO subject as a depraved and dangerous other. \nIndeed, Thomas et al confirm that the press explicitly seeks to sensationalise material \nabout ASBO subjects.105 More interesting, however is the impact of the increasing \nnumber of public agency forms of sensationalist publicity. It has been noted, for \n                                                 \n103 Home Office, op. cit. n. 34, pp. 7-8. \n104 R. Reiner, \u2018Media made criminality. The representation of crime in the mass media\u2019 in M. Maguire, R. \nMorgan and R. Reiner, The Oxford Handbook of Criminology (2002), p. 403. \n105 Thomas et al, op. cit. n. 84. \n 27\nexample, that after seeking ASBOs on grounds of particular anti-social conduct by \nyoung people a number of \u2018[l]ocal authorities and police have released full, often lurid \ndetails of such behaviour and the youngsters have sometimes been prompted to strike \naggressive poses for photographs\u2019.106 Public agencies are clearly not motivated by \ncommercial considerations. What then is the explanation for sensationalism here?  \nOnce again, the motivation of public agencies for such sensationalism can be \nanalysed usefully from a governmental perspective. The issue was considered recently \nby the High Court under the Human Rights Act 1998 in R (Stanley) v Metropolitan \nPolice Commissioner.107 In that case 3,000 leaflets were distributed by Brent London \nBorough Council to members of the community containing details of a number of \nchildren subject to ASBOs. The document itself was clearly sensationalist, describing \nthe individuals at one point as \u2018animalistic \u2026 thugs and bully boys\u2019.108 The defence \nargued that the use of such words breached Article 8 of the European Convention. \nKennedy LJ, however, was ultimately happy to allow for this incursion into \nsensationalism, judging the content of the leaflet entirely proportionate to the legitimate \naim of the prevention of crime and disorder. He drew attention to the importance of \nsensationalism in order to ensure the governmental objective of the responsibilization of \ncommunities as agents of surveillance, describing the language as \u2018colourful, but \u2026 \nneeded in order to attract the attention of the readership\u2019.109 Thus, sensationalism has \nbeen authorized by law, through the Stanley judgment, as necessary to foster further an \nethopolitics of surveillance.  \nHowever, notwithstanding the law\u2019s focus upon surveillance, it is contended that \nthe legal authorization of sensationalism will also encourage public agencies to employ \nsensationalist reportage in pursuit of the other governmental objectives highlighted in \nthis paper. First, sensationalism may be used to reinforce the deviancy of the ASBO \nsubject as other, in order to shore up the community\u2019s fear of anti-social behaviour and, \nas such, their faith in, and dependency upon, these agencies. Second, it could be \nperceived as a way to increase the efficacy of an ethopolitics of shame. The more \ndemonising ASBO publicity, it might be argued, the more the subject, and others \ncontemplating engaging in anti-social behaviour, will be deterred by the impact upon \ntheir reputations. Of course, on the other hand, proponents of welfarism will continue to \nfocus upon the negative impact such sensationalist reportage will have upon the ASBO \n                                                 \n106 Humphries, op. cit. n. 33. \n107 [2004] EWHC 2229. \n108 Id., para. 24. \n109 Id., para. 40. \n 28\nsubject and his or her governance. Sensationalism, they will argue, further reinforces the \ndeviancy of targeted young people, exacerbating the harm caused by stigmatisation and \nlabelling, while the reinforcement of the criminology of the other exacerbates spiralling \npublic fear of \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth and encourages authoritarian responses by the state to \nfurther its own sovereignty. \n \n6. POSSIBILITIES OF WELFARIST RESISTANCE \n \nNotwithstanding these conclusions, it is important to recognise that neo-conservative \nconstructions of the ASBO subject are inevitably not absolute. As the governmentality \nschool makes clear, rationalities and technologies do not follow a clear developmental \nchronology, and as such are never perfectly implemented in practice. As with general \ncrime control, this is certainly the case with youth justice policy. Muncie warns that any \nassessment of the youth justice system must avoid constructing its development as a \nlinear progression of rationalities:  \nThe \u2018new\u2019 never replaces the old. In the twenty-first century discourses of \nprotection, restoration, punishment, responsibility, rehabilitation, welfare, \nretribution, diversion, human rights and so on exist alongside each other in some \nperpetually uneasy and contradictory manner.110  \nIt is particularly important to avoid overstating the apparent punitive turn in crime \ncontrol policies.111 Newburn notes that, in reality, New Labour\u2019s stance on youth justice \n\u2018is somewhat tricky to characterize, for \u2026 one key element of the Government\u2019s style \nwas to \u201ctalk tough\u201d while behind the scenes enabling sometimes more enlightened \npractices to be developed and promulgated\u2019.112 Not only do many central government \ninitiatives continue to reflect welfarist rationales, but the implementation of \nauthoritarian measures is often resisted at the local level.113 Thus, the focus of \ndiscursive analysis upon the texts of central government can be criticised for failing to \ncapture the empirical realities of the governance of young people resulting particularly \n                                                 \n110 J. Muncie, Youth and Crime: A Critical Introduction (2004), p. 249. \n111 R. Matthews, \u2018The myth of punitiveness\u2019 (2005) 9(2) Theoretical Criminology 175. \n112 T. Newburn, \u2018Young people, crime, and youth justice\u2019 in M. Maguire et al, op. cit. n. 104, p. 559. \n113 J. Muncie, \u2018Governing young people: coherence and contradiction in contemporary youth justice\u2019 \n(2006) 26(4) Critical Social Policy 770. The governmentality school has been accused of failing to \nrecognise the agency of local organisations. One might turn instead to the concept of \u2018power dependence\u2019 \ndeveloped by Rod Rhodes, which contends that dependency of the state on local agencies to implement \npolicies provides opportunities for resistance: see Understanding Governance: Policy Networks, \nGovernance, Reflexivity and Accountability (1997).  \n 29\nfrom resistance to, and reconstruction of, rationalities and technologies by those who \nimplement them and those upon whom they are implemented. \nHughes and Follett suggest that such contradictory responses are particularly \nevident in state governance of anti-social behaviour.114 Indeed, on closer examination \nthe implementation of the ASBO provides support for Pavlich\u2019s argument that advanced \nliberalism does not mark the death of the social, but merely the growth of \u2018co-social\u2019 \nforms of governance.115 Burney contends, for instance, that the early failure of local \nagencies to take up the ASBO was, in part at least, a continued preference for welfarist \nforms of intervention.116 Such evidence that exists suggests the ASBO subject remains a \ntarget of the disciplinary techniques of social work as a result of the continued welfarist \napproach to governance of many local agencies, particularly Youth Offending Teams \n(although recent research has concluded that the balance is still very much in favour of \nneo-conservative enforcement objectives).117 Second, welfarist discourses also continue \nto operate at the level of central government. In particular, Individual Support Orders \n(ISOs), introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003,118 mark the return of legal \nauthorization for the formal repositioning of the ASBO subject within the disciplinary \nprocesses of social work, notwithstanding the Government\u2019s continuing promulgation \nof neo-conservative rhetoric.119  \nDeveloping this analysis, I would contend further that neo-conservative discourse \ncannot wholly undermine the pursuit of anonymity for ASBO subjects, given the \nevidence of resistance, on both altruistic and governmental grounds, of local agencies \ncharged with their governance. Moreover, I would suggest, from a legal perspective, \nthat the law authorising youth anonymity provides a space for contestation of the (neo-\nconservative) criminology of the other through individual acts of welfarist resistance. \nAs Rose and Valverde explain:  \n[S]ubjects are constituted in a variety of ways in different legal contexts and \nforums. Each of these subjectifications has a history, each is differentially \nsuffused by the norms and values of positive knowledge.  \nThey continue:  \n                                                 \n114 Hughes and Follett, op. cit. n. 93. \n115 Pavlich, op. cit. n. 12, p. 4. \n116 Burney, op. cit. n. 9. \n117 Squires and Stephens, op. cit. n. 92. \n118 CDA 1998, ss. 1AA and 1AB. \n119 Although, of course, as breach of an order is punishable by criminal sanction (CDA 1998, s. 1AB), \nsovereign coercion continues to underpin this welfarist disciplinary process. See also the Intervention \nOrder under CDA 1998, ss. 1G and 1H, enacted by the Drugs Act 2005. \n 30\nA proper examination of such practices would have to attend to the technicalities \nof legal procedure, and to the ways in which non-legal knowledges can be \nintroduced into legal forums \u2026 A plurality of different forms of expertise have \nattached themselves to the institutions and procedures of the law. Disputes \nbetween biological, psychological, psychiatric and sociological forms of \nknowledge open a potentially inexhaustible space of disputation.120 \nWhat this passage reveals is the extent to which the exercise of judicial discretion can \nprovide an environment within which competing constructions of the particular legal \nsubject, in the form of knowledge and expertise, can be reconstructed. \nJudicial decision-making under section 39 obviously provides one such forum into \nwhich alternative welfarist discourses could continue to permeate. Although under the \nsection a presumption exists in favour of publicity, it can of course be rebutted by a \njudge in the public interest. There are two ways in which welfarist discourse, and \nparticularly the ethopolitics of labelling, might be deployed to persuade a judge of the \nvalue of such an order. First, social workers can leverage their expertise to persuade a \njudge of the value of anonymity to the governance of a particular ASBO subject. By \nreintroducing welfarism within the courtroom neo-conservative discourses could give \nway to those positioning the ASBO subject as vulnerable to the negative ethopolitics of \nlabelling and, accordingly, requiring protection from public stigma. \nSecond, it might also be possible within this forum to harness alternative legal \nstandards that explicitly recognise the ethopolitical relevance of labelling. While \nlabelling theory might carry little weight within the soft law of domestic governmental \npolicy documents, internationally, the 1985 UN Standard Minimum Rules for the \nAdministration of Juvenile Justice (the \u2018Beijing Rules\u2019) explicitly justifies the Article 8 \nright to privacy for juveniles in those ethopolitical terms. Article 8 reads in full: \u2018The \njuvenile\u2019s right to privacy shall be respected at all stages in order to avoid harm being \ncaused to her or him by undue publicity or by the process of labelling. In principle, no \ninformation that may lead to the identification of a juvenile offender shall be published. \nThe official commentary to the Article reads as follows: \u2018Rule 8 stresses the importance \nof the protection of the juvenile's right to privacy. Young persons are particularly \nsusceptible to stigmatization. Criminological research into labelling processes has \nprovided evidence of the detrimental effects (of different kinds) resulting from the \npermanent identification of young persons as \u2018delinquent\u2019 or \u2018criminal\u2019 (my italics).  \n                                                 \n120 Rose and Valverde, op. cit. n. 17, p. 548. \n 31\n  Thus, within the governable space of the court room, opportunities still exist to \nreconstruct the ASBO subject in law through, for instance, the discourses of expert \nevidence or the competing power of international legal standards, both of which \ncontinue to promote an ethopolitics of labelling. Yet, while perhaps unduly pessimistic, \nI would contend finally that successful resistance at the level of the local is, in fact, \nunlikely. Without a fundamental change to the knowledge-power surrounding the \nASBO subject, the rise of publicity as a governmental technique, particularly as part of \nan ethopolitics of surveillance and shame, will continue to place overbearing pressure \nupon courts to refuse to grant a section 39 anonymity order to an ASBO subject. \nEvidence suggests as much. According to the empirical research of Thomas et al, the \nGovernment\u2019s call for increased publicity of the ASBO, together with its recent legal \nreforms, mean that coverage of successful applications and enforcement of breaches are \nnow indeed proving the norm.121 \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThis article positioned the problematization of youth anonymity in ASBO proceedings \nagainst a backdrop of the apparent move from a welfarist to an advanced liberal youth \njustice policy in England and Wales. In doing so, it contended through a genealogy of \nthe principle that the assault upon anonymity is the result of two distinct processes: the \nfall of anonymity, and the rise of publicity, as governmental technologies. I argued, on \nthe one hand, that the rejection of anonymity as an ethopolitical technique reflects the \nimplicit dismissal of labelling theory within neo-conservative discourse. In its place, \none finds a new belief in the value of publicity as part of the neo-liberal \nresponsibilization of communities as agents of crime control through surveillance; part \nof a broader commitment to the ethopolitical strategy of the fostering of active \ncitizenship, together with the shoring up of the sovereignty of national and local \ngovernment. Moreover, within the courts at least, shame has been authorised as a \nvaluable ethopolitical tool for the governance of the ASBO subject. I suggested, finally, \nthat these objectives of surveillance, sovereignty and shame are each reinforced by \nincreasingly sensationalist reportage, providing a possible explanation for this \ndevelopment among public agencies in particular. \nIt is a characteristic of Foucault\u2019s work that he avoids drawing normative \nconclusions about the value of particular forms of power, \u2018concentrating, instead, upon \n                                                 \n121 Thomas et al, op. cit. n. 84. \n 32\nthe actual way in which power operates\u2019.122 It is an approach often criticised for \nprecluding effective critique of advanced liberal forms of rule.123 Throughout this paper, \nconversely, I have highlighted a number of possible welfarist concerns with the growth \nin the publicity of the ASBO subject.  \nInevitably, governance through the publicity of ASBOs will further increase the \nstigmatisation of young people that the right to anonymity sought to avoid. The claim \nunder neo-conservative reconstructions of the ASBO subject is that he or she is \nsusceptible to the positive ethopolitics of shame, rather than the negative ethopolitics of \nlabelling. As I have shown, however, the claimed potency of shame as a governmental \ntechnique does not seem to be borne out by the available empirical evidence, which \nsuggests conversely that the ASBO subject are often not tied within the necessary webs \nof belonging to the disapproving elements of the community, but instead may be subject \nto the more powerful control of competing knowledge, in the form of youth self-\norganization, that promotes the ASBO as a badge of honour. One must also consider the \npossibility that labelling could ultimately undermine the effective governance of ASBO \nsubjects. Indeed, deploying Braithwaite\u2019s empirical work in this area, disregarded by \nthe common sense of neo-conservatism, disintegrative shaming of this kind has \ndangerous implications for social exclusion. \nThe ethopolitics of surveillance poses further problems. For instance, it has not \nbeen shown that policing is aided by the publicity of the ASBO subject; it is unclear \nhow much, and how well, the community actually engages in effective surveillance of \nthe order. It seems a little premature, then, for the Government to assume the need for \npublicity, at the expense of long-standing protections of anonymity, without question. I \nam also concerned that the use of surveillance as a form of ethopolitics may lead to the \nencouragement of a distorted form of active citizenry that reinforces the contemporary \nneo-conservative, exclusionary, conception of \u2018anti-social\u2019 youth. Furthermore, the \npursuit of expressive forms of sovereign rule, in an effort to exert control over political \nterritory, may ultimately cause both central and local government to lose control over \nthe \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019 problem. Indeed, with sensationalism reinforcing the \ndemonisation of young people, both individually and collectively, as other, inclusionary \ntechnologies may prove increasingly unpalatable to a public reliant upon media \nrepresentations of anti-social behaviour.  \n                                                 \n122 N.

Brown, \u2018Governmentality and law and order\u2019 in Wickham and Pavlich, op. cit. n. 12. \n 33\n 34\nFinally, I have explored the particular part played by law and legal systems in \n\u2018authorising\u2019 governance through publicity. As I have contended, the structure of \nsection 39 provides an important opportunity for law\u2019s fielding of the various \nalternative discourses \u2013 classical, welfarist and advanced liberal \u2013 that currently operate \naround the right to anonymity of the ASBO subject. In particular, it is the structure of \nthis section that provides an opportunity for particular welfarist discourses (of the expert \nevidence of social workers and the standards of international law) to reinvigorate both \naltruistic and governmental discourses that favour anonymity where they are deemed \nappropriate. My concern, however, is that pervasive neo-conservative constructions of \nthe ASBO subject as other, together with the importance placed by the judiciary upon \nthe value of the ethopolitics of surveillance and shame, will nevertheless lead to a \ndrastic decrease in the granting of section 39 orders. Governance through anonymity \nlooks likely to prove a further welfarist casualty of advanced liberal rule. \n \n*** \n"}
