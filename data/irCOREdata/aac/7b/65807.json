We find that uncoupled models are\nusually stable in the late universe. However, a coupling to fermions is severely restricted. We check\nwhether a graviton induced fermion-quintessence coupling is compatible with this restriction.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nObservations indicate that dark energy constitutes a\nsubstantial fraction of our Universe [1\u20135]. The range\nof possible candidates includes a cosmological constant\nand \u2013 more flexibly \u2013 some form of dark energy with a\ntime dependent equation of state, called quintessence [6].\nCommonly, realizations of quintessence scenarios feature\na light scalar field [7\u20139].\nThe evolution of the scalar field is usually treated at\nthe classical level. However, quantum fluctuations may\nalter the classical quintessence potential. In this article,\nwe will investigate one-loop contributions to the effective\npotential from both quintessence and fermion fluctua-\ntions. We will show that in the late universe, quintessence\nfluctuations are harmless for most of the potentials used\nin the literature. For inverse power laws and SUGRA\ninspired models, this has already been demonstrated in\n[10]. That the smallness of the quintessence mass needs\nto be protected by some symmetry has been pointed out\nin [11,12].\nIn contrast with the rather harmless quintessence field\nfluctuations, fermion fluctuations severely restrict the\nmagnitude of a possible coupling of quintessence to\nfermionic dark matter, as we will show.\nIn Euclidean conventions, the action we use for the\nquintessence field \u03a6 and a fermionic species \u03a8 to which\nit may couple [13\u201315] is\nS =\n\u222b\nd4x\n\u221a\ng\n[\nM2PR+\n1\n2\n\u2202\u00b5\u03a6(x)\u2202\n\u00b5\u03a6(x) + V (\u03a6(x))\n+ \u03a8\u00af(x)\n[\ni \/\u2207+ \u03b35mf(\u03a6)\n]\n\u03a8(x)\n]\n, (1)\nwith mf(\u03a6) as a \u03a6 dependent fermion mass. This \u03a6 de-\npendence (if existent in a model) determines the coupling\nof the quintessence field to the fermions. As long as one is\nnot interested in quantum gravitational effects, one may\nset\n\u221a\ng = 1, R = 0 and replace \/\u2207\u2192 \/\u2202 in the action (1).\n\u2217\ndoran@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de\n\u2020\njaeckel@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de\nV \u2032\u2032(\u03a6cl)\n...\n(a)\nV \u2032\u2032(\u03a6cl)\n...\nV \u2032\u2032(\u03a6cl)\n...\n(b)\nFIG. 1. Pure quintessence fluctuations (depicted as dashed\nlines). The loop of the fluctuating quintessence field modifies\nthe potential. Since the potential involves in principle arbi-\ntrary powers of \u03a6, we depict V \u2032\u2032 as multiple external lines.\nBy means of a saddle point expansion [16], we ar-\nrive at the effective action \u0393[\u03a6cl] to one loop order of\nthe quintessence field. The equation governing the dy-\nnamics of the quintessence field is then determined by\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03a6cl]|\u03a6cl=\u03a6\u22c6cl = 0. When estimating the magnitude of\nthe loop corrections, we will assume that \u03a6\u22c6cl is close to\nthe solution of the classical field equations: \u03b4S = 0. Eval-\nuating \u0393 for constant fields, we can factor out the space-\ntime volume U from \u0393 = UV . This gives the effective\npotential\nV1-loop(\u03a6cl) = V (\u03a6cl)+\n\u039b2\n32pi2\nV \u2032\u2032(\u03a6cl)\u2212 \u039b\n2\nferm\n8pi2\n[mf(\u03a6cl)]\n2\n.\n(2)\nHere, primes denote derivatives with respect to \u03a6; \u03a6cl\nis the classical field value and \u039b and \u039bferm are the ul-\ntra violet cutoffs of scalar and fermion fluctuations. The\nlast term in Equation (2) accounts for the fermionic loop\ncorrections as shown in figure 3. The second term in\nEquation (2), is the leading order scalar loop, depicted\nin figure 1(a). We neglect graphs of the order (V \u2032\u2032|cl)\n2\nand higher like the one in figure 1(b), because V and its\nderivatives are of the order 10\u2212120 (see section III). We\nhave also ignored \u03a6-independent contributions, as these\nwill not influence the quintessence dynamics.\nHowever, the \u03a6-independent contributions add up to a\ncosmological constant of the order \u039b4 \u2248 O(M4P). This is\nthe old cosmological constant problem, common to most\nfield theories. We hope that some symmetry or a more\nfundamental theory will force it to vanish. The same\nsymmetries or theories could equally well remove the loop\n1\ncontribution by some cancelling mechanism. After all,\nthis mechanism must be there, for the observed cosmo-\nlogical constant is far less than the naively calculated\nO(M4P). Unfortunately, SUSY is broken too badly to be\nthis symmetry [11].\nIn addition, none of the potentials under investigation\ncan be renormalized in the strict sense. However, as we\nwill see, terms preventing renormalization may in some\ncases be absent to leading order in V \u2032\u2032|cl. As the mass of\nthe quintessence field is extremely small, one may for all\npractical purposes view these specific potentials (such as\nthe exponential potential) as renormalizable.\nThere is also a loophole for all models that will be\nruled out in the following: The potential used in a given\nmodel could be the full effective potential including all\nquantum fluctuations, down to macroscopic scales. For\ncoupled quintessence models, this elegant argument is\nrather problematic and the loophole shrinks to a point\n(see section III).\nIn the following, we apply Equation (2) to various\nquintessence models in order to check their stability\nagainst one loop corrections. We do this separately for\ncoupled and uncoupled models. We use units in which\nMP = 1. For clarity, we restore it when appropriate.\nII. UNCOUPLED QUINTESSENCE\nHere, we are going to discuss inverse power law, pure\nand modified exponential, and cosine-type potentials.\nA. Inverse power law and exponential potentials\nInverse power laws [7,8], exponential potentials [9,17]\nand mixtures of both [18] can be treated by considering\nthe potential V = A\u03a6\u2212\u03b1 exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03a6\u03b3) [19]. Limiting cases\ninclude inverse power laws, exponentials, and SUGRA\ninspired models. Deriving twice with respect to \u03a6, we\nfind\nV \u2032\u2032 = A\u03a6\u2212\u03b1 exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03a6\u03b3)\n{\n\u03b1(\u03b1+ 1)\u03a6\u22122 + 2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b3\u03a6\u03b3\u22122\n+ \u03bb2\u03b32\u03a62\u03b3\u22122 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b3(\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03a6\u03b3\u22122\n}\n. (3)\n1. Inverse power laws\nFor inverse power laws, we set \u03b3 = \u03bb = 0. This\ngives the classical potential V iplcl = A\u03a6\n\u2212\u03b1\ncl and by means\nof Equation (2) the loop corrected potential\nV ipl1-loop = V\nipl\ncl\n(\n1 +\n1\n32pi2\n\u039b2\u03b1(\u03b1+ 1)\u03a6\u22122cl\n)\n. (4)\nThe potential is form stable if 132\u03c02 \u039b\n2\u03b1(\u03b1 + 1)\u03a6\u22122 \u226a 1,\nwhich today is satisfied, as \u03a6 \u2248 MP [18].\nHowever, if the field is on its attractor today, then\n\u03a6 \u221d (1 + z)\u22123\/(\u03b1+2), where z is the redshift [18]. Using\nthis, we have for z \u226b 1\nV ipl1-loop \u2248 V iplcl\n(\n1 +\n1\n32pi2\n\u039b2\u03b1(\u03b1 + 1)z6\/(\u03b1+2)\n)\n. (5)\nThus, the cutoff needs to satisfy \u039b2 \u226a 32\u03c02\u03b1(\u03b1+1)\u00d7z\u22126\/(\u03b1+2).\nCosmologically viable inverse power law potentials seem\nto be restricted to \u03b1 < 2 [20,21]. Using \u03b1 = 1 and z \u2248 104\nfor definiteness, the bound becomes \u039b2 \u226a 10\u22126.\nSo, at equality (and even worse before that epoch), the\ncutoff needs to be well below 1012 Gev, if classical calcu-\nlations are meant to be valid. In [10] it is argued that for\ninverse power laws, the quintessence content in the early\nuniverse is negligible and hence the fluctuation correc-\ntions are important only at an epoch where quintessence\nis subdominant. As the loop corrections introduce only\nhigher negative powers in the field, it is hoped that, even\nthough one does not know the detailed dynamics, the\nfield will nevertheless roll down its potential (which at\nthat time is supposed to be much steeper) and by the\ntime it is is cosmologically relevant, the classical treat-\nment is once again valid. Having no means of calculating\nthe true effective potential for the inverse power law in\nthe early universe, this view is certainly appealing.\n2. Pure exponential potentials\nThe pure exponential potential is special because its\nderivatives are multiples of itself. The classical potential\n(with \u03b1 = 0, \u03b3 = 1) is V epcl = A exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03a6cl) and to one\nloop order\nV ep1-loop = V\nep\ncl\n{\n1 +\n1\n32pi2\n\u039b2\u03bb2\n}\n. (6)\nIt is easy to see that a rescaling of A \u2192\nA\/\n(\n1 + 132\u03c02 \u039b\n2\u03bb2\n)\nabsorbs the loop correction, leading\nto a stable potential up to order V \u2032\u2032cl . Working to next to\nleading order, i.e. restoring terms of order (V \u2032\u2032cl )\n2, we get\nV ep1-loop, n.l. =\n1\n32pi2\n(V \u2032\u2032cl )\n2\nln\n(\nV \u2032\u2032cl\n\u039b2\n)\n.\nIt is this term which in four dimensions spoils strict renor-\nmalizability.\nB. Nambu-Goldstone cosine potentials\nCosine type potentials resulting from a quintessence\naxion were introduced in [22,23] and their implications\nfor the CMB have been studied in [24]. They take on\nthe classical potential V ngcl = A [1\u2212 cos (\u03a6cl\/fQ)] and in-\ncluding loop corrections\nV as1-loop = A\n[\n1\u2212\n{\n1\u2212 1\n32pi2\n\u039b2\nf2Q\n}\ncos\n(\n\u03a6cl\nfQ\n)]\n.\n2\nUpon a redefinition A \u2192 A\/\n{\n1\u2212 132\u03c02 \u039b\n2\nf2\nQ\n}\nand, recall-\ning that the loop correction is only defined up to a con-\nstant, one arrives at the same functional form as the clas-\nsical potential.\nC. Modified exponentials\nIn the model proposed by Albrecht and Skordis [25],\nthe classical potential is V ascl = Vp exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03a6cl), where Vp\nis a polynomial in the field. To one loop order, this leads\nto\nV as1-loop = V\nas\ncl\n{\n1 +\n1\n32pi2\n\u039b2\n(\nV \u2032\u2032p\nVp\n\u2212 2\u03bb V\n\u2032\np\nVp\n+ \u03bb2\n)}\n.\n(7)\nLet us for definiteness discuss the example given in [25],\nwhere the authors chose Vp(\u03a6) = (\u03a6 \u2212 B)2 + C. With\nthis choice, we have\nV as, exmpl1-loop = V\nas, exmpl\ncl\n{\n1 +\n1\n32pi2\n\u039b2\n( 1\nVp\n[\n2\n\u2212 4\u03bb(\u03a6cl \u2212B)\n]\n+ \u03bb2\n)}\n. (8)\nNow consider field values close to the minimum of Vp, i.e.,\nlet the absolute value of \u03be \u2261 \u03a6cl \u2212B be small compared\nto\n\u221a\nC. Then\nV as, exmpl1-loop = V\nas, exmpl\ncl\n{\n1 +\n\u039b2\n32pi2\n(\n2\u2212 4\u03bb\u03be\nC + \u03be2\n+ \u03bb2\n)}\n,\n(9)\nand to leading order in \u03be\nV as, exmpl1-loop \u2248 V as, exmplcl\n{\n1 +\n\u039b2\n32pi2\n(\n1\nC\n[2\u2212 4\u03bb\u03be] + \u03bb2\n)}\n.\n(10)\nNow consider, as was the case in the example given in\n[25], C = 0.01 for definiteness. If we assume a cutoff \u039b\nand a Plank mass of approximately the same order, we\nget\nV as, exmpl1-loop \u2248 V as, exmplcl\n{\n1 +\n1\n32pi2\n(\n100 [2\u2212 4\u03bb\u03be] + \u03bb2)} .\n(11)\nThe \u03be (and hence \u03a6cl) dependent contribution in the\ncurly brackets of Equation (11) is \u221225\/(2pi2)\u03bb\u03be which\nfor the value \u03bb = 8 chosen in the example gives\n\u2212200\/(2pi2)\u03be \u2248 \u221210\u03be.\nIf we now look at the behaviour of the loop correction\nas a function of \u03a6cl and hence \u03be in the vicinity of the\nminimum of this example polynomial, we see that for,\ne.g., \u03be = 0.01, the one loop contribution dominates the\nclassical potential giving rise to a linear term in \u03a6cl unac-\ncounted for in the classical treatment. For many values of\nthe parameters B and C, this just changes the form and\n34.8 34.9 35 35.1\n\u03a6\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\nV(\n\u03a6\n)\nclassical\n1\u2212loop\nFIG. 2.

The classical potential has\na local minimum, which is absent for the loop corrected one.\nThis is a hand-picked example and in most cases, the bump\nwill not vanish but move and change its form.\nlocation of the bump in the potential. In principle, how-\never the loop correction can remove the local minimum\naltogether (see figure 2).\nNeedless to say that this finding depends crucially on\nthe cutoff. If it is chosen small enough, the conclusion is\ncircumvented. In addition, only the specific choice of Vp\nabove has been shown to be potentially unstable. The\nspace of polynomials is certainly large enough to provide\nnumerous stable potentials of the Albrecht and Skordis\nform.\nIII. COUPLED QUINTESSENCE\nVarious models featuring a coupling of quintessence\nto some form of dark matter have been proposed\n[26,14,27,28,15]. From the action Equation (1), we see\nthat the mass of the fermions could be \u03a6 dependent:\nmf = mf(\u03a6cl). Two possible realization of this mass\ndependence are, for instance, mf = m\n0\nf exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03a6cl) and\nmf = m\n0\nf + c(\u03a6cl), where in the second case, we may\nhave a large field independent part together with small\ncouplings to quintessence.1 For the model discussed in\n[14], the coupling is of the first form, whereas in [15], the\ncoupling is realized by multiplying the cold dark matter\nLagrangian by a factor f(\u03a6). This factor is usually taken\nof the form f(\u03a6) = 1+\u03b1(\u03a6\u2212\u03a60)\u03b2 . Hence, the coupling\nis mf(\u03a6) = f(\u03a6)m\n0\nf , if we assume that dark matter is\n1The constant m0f is not the fermion mass today, which\nwould rather be mtoday = mf(\u03a6cl(today)).\n3\nfermionic. If it were bosonic, the following arguments\nwould be similar.\nWe will first discuss general bounds on the coupling\nand in a second step check whether these bounds are\nbroken via an effective gravitational coupling.\nA. General bounds on a coupling\nWe will discuss only the new effects coming from the\ncoupling and set\nV1-loop = Vcl \u2212\u2206V, (12)\nwhere \u2206V = \u039b2ferm [mf(\u03a6cl)]\n2\n\/\n(\n8pi2\n)\n. If we assume that\nthe potential energy of the quintessence field constitutes\na considerable part of the energy density of the universe\ntoday, i.e. \u03c1q \u223c \u03c1critical, we see from the Friedmann\nequation\n3H2 = \u03c1critical, (13)\nthat Vcl \u223c H2. With today\u2019s Hubble parameter H =\n8.9\u00d7 10\u221261 h (h = 0.5 . . . 0.9), we have\nVcl \u223c 7.9\u00d7 10\u2212121 h2. (14)\nThe ratio of the \u2018correction\u2019 to the classical potential is\n\u2206V\nVcl\n=\n1\n8pi2\n\u039b2ferm [mf(\u03a6cl)]\n2\nVcl\n. (15)\nLet us first consider the case that all of the fermion\nmass is field dependent, i.e., we consider cases like mf =\nm0f exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03a6cl). As an example, we choose a fermion\ncutoff at the GUT scale \u039bferm = 10\n\u22123, and a fermion\nmass, mf(\u03a6cl) of the order of 100Gev = 10\n\u221216MP. Then\nEquation (15) gives the overwhelmingly large ratio\n\u2206V\nVcl\n\u2248 1080. (16)\nThus, the classical potential is negligible relative to the\ncorrection induced by the fermion fluctuations.\nHaving made this estimate, it is clear that the fermion\nloop corrections are harmless only, if the square of the\ncoupling takes on exactly the same form as the classical\npotential itself. If, for example, we have an exponen-\ntial potential Vcl = A exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03a6cl) together with a cou-\npling mf(\u03a6cl) = m\n0\nf exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03a6cl), then this coupling can\nonly be tolerated, if 2\u03b2 = \u03bb.2 Taken at face value, this\nfinding restricts models with these types of coupling. It\nis however interesting to note that for exponential cou-\npling, the case 2\u03b2 = \u03bb is not ruled out by cosmological\nobservations [28].\n2Of course, a sufficiently small \u03b2 will lead to a more or less\nconstant contribution, where mf(\u03a6cl) \u2248 m0f \u2212 \u03b2\u03a6cl.\nmf(\u03a6cl) mf(\u03a6cl)\nFIG. 3. Correction to the quintessence potential due to\nfermion fluctuations. Fermion lines are solid, quintessence\nlines dashed. Shown is the case where mf(\u03a6) gives a\nYukawa coupling, i.e. c(\u03a6) = \u03b2\u03a6, corresponding to one\nquintessence line. Of course, for more complicated mf(\u03a6)\nsuch as mf(\u03a6cl) = m\n0\nf exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03a6cl), several external lines as in\nfigure 1 would appear.\nTurning to the possibility of a fermion mass that con-\nsists of a field independent part and a coupling, i.e.,\nmf = m\n0\nf + c(\u03a6cl), Equation (15) becomes\n\u2206V\nVcl\n=\n1\n8pi2\n\u039b2ferm\n[\n2m0f c(\u03a6cl) + c(\u03a6cl)\n2\n]\nVcl\n, (17)\nwhere we have ignored a quintessence field independent\ncontribution proportional to (m0f )\n2. Assuming c(\u03a6cl) \u226a\nm0f , and demanding that the loop corrections should be\nsmall compared to the classical potential, Equation (17)\nyields the bound\nc(\u03a6cl)\u226a 4pi\n2 Vcl\n\u039b2fermm\n0\nf\n. (18)\nIf, as above, we assume \u039bferm = 10\n\u22123MP, m0f = 10\n\u221216MP\nand Vcl from Equation (14), this gives\nc(\u03a6cl)\u226a 3\u00d7 10\u221297, (19)\nin units of the Planck mass. Once again, the bound from\nEquation (18) applies only if the functional form of the\nloop correction differs from the classical potential. As-\nsuming a Yukawa-type coupling c(\u03a6cl) = \u03b2\u03a6cl and field\nvalues of at least the order of the Plank mass, we get\n\u03b2 \u226a 10\u221297.\nFor the coupling c(\u03a6) = m0f \u03b1(\u03a6\u2212\u03a60)\u03b2 with the values\n\u03b1 = 50, \u03b2 = 8, \u03a60 = 32.5 given in [15], c(\u03a6) is usually\nlarger than m0f . Therefore we take mf(\u03a6cl) \u2248 c(\u03a6cl).\nWith mf(\u03a6cl) = 10\n\u221216 as before, we get the same result\nas in (16).\nThe coupled models share one property: the loop con-\ntribution from the coupling is by far larger than the clas-\nsical potential. At first sight, the golden way out of this\nseems to be to view the potential as already effective:\nall fluctuations would be included from the start. How-\never, there is no particular reason, why any coupling of\nquintessence to dark matter should produce just exactly\nthe effective potential used in a particular model: there is\na relation between the coupling and the effective poten-\ntial generated. Put another way, if the effective potential\nis of an elegant form and we have a given coupling, then\nit seems unlikely that the classical potential could itself\nbe elegant or natural.\n4\nV (\u03a6cl)\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(a)\nV (\u03a6cl)\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(b)\nFIG. 4. Effective fermion-quintessence coupling via gravi-\nton exchange. The fermions (solid lines) emit gravitons (wig-\ngled lines) which are caught by the quintessence field (dashed\nlines). As the graphs involve couplings of the gravitons to\nthe classical quintessence potential, the generated coupling is\nproportional to the classical potential. Since the potential in-\nvolves arbitrary powers of \u03a6, we depict it as several \u03a6-lines. A\nYukawa type coupling, corresponding to just one line, is then\ngenerated by power expanding V (\u03a6) = V (\u03a6cl)+V\n\u2032\n|cl (\u03a6\u2212\u03a6cl)\nin the fluctuating field.\nB. Effective gravitational fermion quintessence\ncoupling\nThe bound in Equation (18) is so severe that the\nquestion arises whether gravitational coupling between\nfermions and the quintessence field violates it. To give an\nestimate, we calculate3 two simple processes depicted in\nfigure 4. We evaluate the diagrams for vanishing external\nmomenta. This is consistent with our derivation of the\nfermion loop correction Equation (2), in which we have\nassumed momentum independent couplings. The effec-\ntive coupling due to the graviton exchange contributes to\nthe fermion mass, which becomes \u03a6cl dependent. We as-\nsume that this coupling is small compared to the fermion\nmass and write mf(\u03a6cl) = m\n0\nf + c(\u03a6cl).\nFrom the first diagram, figure 4(a) we get (see the\n3Unfortunately, the field-dependent propagator matrix is\nnon-diagonal (\u03a6cl 6= 0 usually). This is a subtle point. We\nsplit the full propagator into a field-independent part P and\na field-dependent part F . The logarithm in STr log(P +F ) is\nthen expanded in powers of F . For the Weyl-Frame calcula-\ntion in Section IV this is not longer possible, as the graviton-\ngraviton propagator involves the field \u03c72 and thus the field-\nindependent part P is non-invertible. For simplicity, we ig-\nnored the gravity part in the Weyl-Frame calculation (includ-\ning the coupling of gravitons to \u03c7).\nV (\u03a6cl)\n...\nFIG. 5.

(21)\nHere, we have introduced infrared and ultraviolet cutoffs\n\u03bb and \u039b for the graviton momenta. We assume \u039b to\nbe of the order MP and \u03bb about the inverse size of the\nhorizon. Since the results depend only logarithmically\non the cutoffs, this choice is not critical, and in addition\nln(MP\/H) \u2248 140, which is small. From Equation (17,\n21, 20), we see that, in leading order, the change in the\nquintessence potential due to this effective fermion cou-\npling would be proportional to V (\u03a6cl) and could hence be\nabsorbed upon redefining the pre-factor of the potential\n(see also figure 5). In next to leading order, the contri-\nbution is proportional to V (\u03a6cl)\n2, which is negligible.\nFrom the Appendix A, in which we present the calcu-\nlation in more detail, it is clear that there are processes\nwhere the vertices are more complicated. However, to\nthis order all diagrams are proportional to V (\u03a6cl). Thus,\nthey can be absorbed just like the two processes presented\nabove.\nIV. WEYL TRANSFORMED FIELDS\nSo far, we have assumed a constant Planck mass to-\ngether with a field independent cutoff. We could, how-\never, assume that the Planck mass is not constant, but\nrather given by the expectation value of a scalar field \u03c7.\nWe will call the frame resulting from this Weyl scaling\nthe Weyl frame, as opposed to the frame with a constant\nPlank mass which we will call the Einstein frame. From\nthe classical point of view, both frames are equivalent.\nOn calculating quantum corrections, we have to evaluate\na functional integral. Usually, the functional measure in\n5\nthe Einstein frame is set to unity. In principle, the vari-\nable change associated with the Weyl scaling leads to a\nnon-trivial Jacobian and therefore a different functional\nmeasure. Taking the position that the Weyl frame is\nfundamental, this measure could equally well be set to\nunity in the Weyl frame. Therefore, it is a priori unclear\nwhether the loop corrected potential in the Weyl frame,\nwhen transformed back into the Einstein frame, will be\nthe same as the one from Equation (2).\nAs the cutoff in the Einstein frame is a constant mass\nscale and hence proportional to the Plank mass, it seems\nnatural to assume that the cutoff in the Weyl frame is\nproportional to \u03c7. We restrict our discussion to this case.\nFor other choices of the \u03c7-dependence of the cutoff, the\nresults may differ.\nThe Weyl transformation is achieved by scaling the\nmetric, the curvature scalar, all fields, and the tetrad by\nappropriate powers of \u03c7\/MP (see table I) [9,26]:\nS\u02dc =\n\u222b\nd4x\n\u221a\ng\u02dc\n[\n\u03c72R\u02dc +\nz\n2\n\u2202\u00b5\u03c7\u2202\n\u00b5\u03c7+W (\u03c7)\n+ \u02dc\u00af\u03a8\n(\ni \u03b3\u02dc\u00b5(x)\u2207\u00b5 + \u03c7 mf(\u03a6cl)\nMP\n\u03b35 \u2212 3\n2\ni\u03b3\u02dc\u00b5(x) ln\u03c7,\u00b5\n)\n\u03a8\u02dc\n]\n,\n(22)\nwhere \u03a6 = (12 + z)1\/2MP ln(\u03c7\/MP) and\nW (\u03c7) \u2261\n(\n\u03c7\nMP\n)4\nV (\u03a6(\u03c7)). (23)\nThe term proportional to ln\u03c7,\u00b5 in Equation (22) is some-\nwhat inconvenient. Adopting the position that the Weyl\nframe is fundamental, this term is unnatural.

Weyl scaling of various quantities. The trans-\nformation of the curvature scalar R follows from the scaling\nof the metric. This scaling, in turn, originates from the con-\ndition that instead of the Plank mass squared multiplying R\nin the action in the Einstein frame, a factor \u03c72 should appear.\nHere, we have set \u03c3 = ln(\u03c7\/MP).\nto the fermions in the Einstein frame, which we can safely\nignore.4\nWorking with Equation (24), we get the loop correction\nin the Weyl frame by replacing V \u2192 W and \u03a6 \u2192 \u03c7 in\nEquation (2). In addition, the constant cutoffs \u039b and\n\u039bferm are replaced by const \u00b7 \u03c7:\nW1-loop = W (\u03c7) +\n(C\u03c7)2\n32pi2 z2\nW \u2032\u2032(\u03c7)\n\u2212 (Cf\u03c7)\n2\n8pi2\n[\n\u03c7\nMP\nmf(\u03c7)\n]2\n.

The Weyl frame potential is\nW (\u03c7) = A\u03c74 exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03a6cl(\u03c7)) = A\u03c7(4\u2212\u03bb\n\u221a\n12+z).

Since the theory is non-renormalizable anyway, this\nis not of great concern. In addition, if one believes that the\nWeyl frame is fundamental, there is no need to go back to the\nEinstein frame and hence no need to face this nuisance.\n6\nAgain (and not surprisingly) we can absorb the terms in\nthe square brackets in a redefinition of the pre-factor A.\nIn the case of an inverse power law, the term propor-\ntional to V \u2032 in Equation (27) leads to a slightly different\ncontribution compared to Equation (4) (a term \u221d \u03a6\u2212\u03b1\u22121cl\narises). For the modified exponential potentials the ex-\npressions corresponding to V \u2032 in Equation (27) make no\nstructural difference.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have calculated quantum corrections to the classi-\ncal potentials of various quintessence models. In the late\nuniverse, most potentials are stable with respect to the\nscalar quintessence fluctuations. The pure exponential\nand Nambu-Goldstone type potentials are form invari-\nant up to order V \u2032\u2032, yet terms of order (V \u2032\u2032)2 prevent\nthem from being renormalizable in the strict sense.\nFor the modified exponential potential introduced by\nAlbrecht and Skordis, stability depends on the specific\nform of the polynomial factor Vp in the potential. In\nsome cases the local minimum in the potential can even\nbe removed by the loop.\nAn explicit coupling of the quintessence field to\nfermions (or similarly to dark matter bosons) seems to\nbe severely restricted. The effective potential to one loop\nlevel would be completely dominated by the contribution\nfrom the fermion fluctuations. All models in the litera-\nture share this fate. One way around this conclusion\ncould be to view these potentials as already effective.\nThey must, however, not only be effective in the sense\nof an effective quantum field theory originating as a low-\nenergy limit of an underlying theory, but also include all\nfluctuations from this effective QFT. In this case, there is\na strong connection between coupling and potential and\nit is rather unlikely that the correct pair can be guessed.\nThe bound on the coupling is so severe that for con-\nsistency, we have calculated an effective coupling due to\ngraviton exchange. To lowest order in V (\u03a6), this cou-\npling leads to a fermion contribution which can be ab-\nsorbed by redefining the pre-factor of the potential.\nTo check that the results are not artefacts from the\nEinstein frame, we switched to the Weyl frame. As the\ntransition from \u03a6 \u2192 \u03c7 involves a non-trivial Jacobian,\nthe details of the results differ. However, the basic results\nstay the same.\nSurely, the one-loop calculation does not give the true\neffective potential. Symmetries or more fundamental the-\nories that make the cosmological constant as small as it\nis, could force loop contributions to cancel. In addition,\nthe back reaction of the changing effective potential on\nthe fluctuations remains unclear in the one loop calcula-\ntion. A renormalization group treatment would therefore\nbe of great value. We leave this to future work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Gert Aarts, Luca Amen-\ndola, Ju\u00a8rgen Berges, Matthew Lilley, Volker Schatz, and\nChristof Wetterich for helpful discussions.\nAPPENDIX A: COUPLING TO GRAVITONS\nFermions in general relativity are usually treated\nwithin the tetrad formalism. The \u03b3 matrices become\nspace-time dependent: \u03b3\u00b5(x) \u2261 \u03b3ae\u00b5a(x). Together with\nthe spin connection \u03c9, one uses (see, e.g., [29,30]):\n\/\u2207 = e\u00b5a(x)\u03b3a\n(\n\u2202\u00b5 +\ni\n4\n\u03c3bc\u03c9\nbc\n\u00b5\n)\n. (A1)\nThe action (1) can then be expanded in small fluctuations\naround flat space: g\u00b5\u03bd = \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd + h\u00b5\u03bd\/MP.\nUsing the gauge fixing term \u2212 12 (\u2202\u03bdh\u00b5\u03bd\u2212 12 \u2202\u00b5h\u03bd\u03bd)2 and\nexpanding the action to second order in h, we find the\npropagator [30]:\nP\u22121grav(k) =\n\u03b4\u00b5\u03b1\u03b4\u03bd\u03b2 + \u03b4\u00b5\u03b2\u03b4\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\nk2\n. (A2)\nThe diagrams in figure 4 are generated by the expan-\nsion of\n\u221a\ng = 1+ 12 h\n\u00b5\u00b5\u2212 14 (h\u00b5\u03bd)2+ 18 (h\u00b5\u00b5)2 multiplying\nthe matter Lagrangian. Additional (and more compli-\ncated) vertices originate from the spin connection and\nthe tetrad.\nHowever, we do not consider external graviton lines,\nwhich would only give corrections to the couplings and\nwave function renormalization of the gravitons. There-\nfore only internal gravitons appear. In order to con-\ntribute a quintessence dependent part to the fermion\nmass, the gravitons starting from the fermion-graviton\nvertices (complicated as they may be) have to touch\nquintessence-graviton vertices. As these quintessence\nvertices are proportional to V (\u03a6cl), all diagrams to low-\nest order in V (\u03a6cl) will only produce mass contributions\nproportional to V (\u03a6cl).\nEvaluating the diagrams in figure 4 for vanishing ex-\nternal momenta we get (20) and (21).\n[1] A.
