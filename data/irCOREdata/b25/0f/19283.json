A universal mechanism for virus\npersistence involves latency, where viral genes are transcriptionally\nsilenced and, therefore, not available as targets for immune\neffectors. In addition, viruses may exhibit active immune-evasion\nmechanisms. In this context, the herpesviruses are paradigmatic.\nFor example, the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, a b-herpesvi-\nrus), encodes at least 25 proteins with immune-modulating\nfunctions [1], of which 5 can impair antigen presentation via\nMHC-class I to the CD8+ T cell responses: US6 binds to the\ntransporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex to\ninhibit peptide transport from the cytosol to the ER [2\u20134], US3\n[5\u20137] and US10 [8] interfere with the maturation of MHC class I\nheavy chains and their egress from the ER, while US2 and US11\ntrigger retrograde transport of MHC class I from the ER to the\ncytosol with subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation [9\u201311].\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a c1-herpesvirus whose normal\nbiology is fundamentally distinct from most other human\nherpesviruses in that it has growth-transforming activity for\nhuman B cells [12]. This provides an alternative strategy for\nreplicating virus genomes in proliferating cells without necessarily\nproducing infectious viral progeny. This is a potentially dangerous\nstrategy and it is unsurprising, therefore, that EBV is associated\nwith the pathogenesis of certain human cancers [12,13].\nNevertheless, EBV has evolved to persist asymptomatically in\nmost immunocompetent individuals, and it is ubiquitous in adult\npopulations worldwide. This successful persistence is largely\nattributable to the ability of EBV to establish various types of\n\u2018latency\u2019 (i.e. not producing infectious virus progeny) in lymphoid\ncells [14]. It is notable that the most restricted forms of latency\n(which involve expression either of no viral genes, or of non-coding\nsmall RNAs and possibly the poorly immunogenic EBNA1 and\/or\nLMP2A proteins) are normally associated with quiescent cells and\ncan evade recognition by CD8+ T cells [12,14,15]. In contrast, the\nform of latency associated with growth transformation is\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e1000255\ncharacterized by expression of at least 8 viral proteins, including\nimmunodominant antigens [12,14,15], together with enhanced\nexpression of antigen presentation components [16,17] that render\nthe cells susceptible to recognition and elimination by EBV-\nspecific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo [12,14,15]. The\nincreased incidence of EBV-associated B lymphoproliferative\ndisease in iatrogenically immunosuppressed transplant patients\n[12,18] emphasizes the need for adaptive T cell immune responses\nto prevent uncontrolled proliferation of EBV-transformed B cells.\nWhile the interaction of EBV with the host immune responses\ndiffers from non-oncogenic herpesviruses during the growth-\ntransforming phase of virus infection, it does share many\nproperties with non-oncogenic herpesviruses during the lytic virus\nreplication phase of the viral life-cycle. Responses to EBV lytic\ncycle antigens dominate the EBV-specific T cell response in both\nprimary and persistent infection with the virus, but the ability of\nCD8+ T cells to recognize EBV-infected B cells in lytic cycle is\ncompromised by a reduced expression of cell surface MHC class I\n[15,19,20]. The levels of cell surface MHC class I in lytic cycle\nreflect active interference with the antigen processing pathway by\nmechanisms that are poorly understood but which are at least in\npart due to an impairment of TAP-dependent peptide transport\ninto the ER [21] and by host protein synthesis shutoff [22]. The\nearly lytic cycle genes, BNLF2a and BGLF5 were recently identified\nas genes targeting TAP function [23] and host-shutoff [22,24]\nrespectively. While BGLF5 protein remains expressed throughout\nlytic cycle, BNLF2a protein expression decreases within 24 hr of\ninduction and probably only acts during the early stages of lytic\ncycle (N. Croft, D. Horst et al, manuscript in preparation).\nIn the present study, we have identified a third lytic cycle gene\nthat actively interferes with MHC class I antigen presentation to\nCD8+ T cells by increasing the turnover of MHC class I molecules\nat the cell surface and targeting them for lysosomal degradation.\nThis new immune-evasion function of EBV mapped to BILF1,\nwhich was previously identified as a rhodopsin-like seven-\ntransmembrane segment G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)\nwith constitutive signaling functions [25\u201327]. We have character-\nized the molecular mechanisms by which BILF1 increases MHC\nclass I turnover, and found them to be independent of its G-\nprotein activating function and distinct from the mechanisms\nemployed by other herpesviruses that target MHC class I for\ndegradation.\nResults\nBILF1 affects MHC class I expression and antigen\npresentation to CD8+ T cells\nWe initiated a systematic screen of the EBV lytic genes to\nidentify viral products that might affect MHC class I expression.\nEBV genes were cloned into the bicistronic vector pCDNA3-\nIRES-nls-GFP, which co-expresses the inserted gene with GFP,\nthen transfected into 293 and MJS cells. At 48 h after transfection,\nthe cells were stained with PE-conjugated W6\/32 mAb and the\nlevels of surface MHC class I molecules were measured by flow\ncytometry. Representative results of W6\/32 staining in transfected\n293 cells are shown in Fig. 1A. As a negative control, \u2018empty\u2019\npCDNA3-IRES-nls-GFP vector was transfected, and as a positive\ncontrol, a known immune-evasion gene was transfected using the\npCDNA3-BNLF2a-IRES-nls-GFP vector. The results show that\nthe LF2, BMRF2, and BILF2 had no effect on MHC class I levels,\nwhereas BILF1 caused a reduction comparable to BNLF2a. In\naddition, two other EBV genes, LF1 and BXLF2 were also\nscreened in the same set of experiments and had no effect on\nMHC class I levels (data not shown). This assay was then extended\nto a second cell line (MJS) chosen for its expression of MHC class\nII as well as MHC class I molecules, which confirmed the\ndownregulation of MHC class I by BILF1, with no effect on the\nlevels of MHC class II (Fig. 1B).\nThese screening experiments suggested a specific effect on\nsurface MHC class I expression by BILF1. To examine this in\nmore detail, we generated a retroviral expression vector for BILF1,\nand transduced both 293 and MJS cells to generate stable cell lines\nexpressing BILF1. Since the BILF1 in these retroviral vectors\ncontained an N-terminal HA-tag sequence, expression of BILF1 in\nthe transduced cells was initially confirmed by staining of viable\ncells with anti-HA mAb and flow cytometry analysis (data not\nshown). Staining with PE-W6\/32 mAb confirmed that expression\nof MHC class I expression at the cell surface was reduced in\nBILF1-expressing 293 and MJS cells relative to paired lines\ntransduced with a control retrovirus vector (Fig. 2A). This effect\nwas reproducibly stronger in the stable retroviral transduced cells\nthan in the previous transient-transfection experiments. No\ndownregulation of MHC class II in MJS, nor of transferrin\nreceptor (TfR) in 293 or MJS, was observed by flow cytometry\n(data not shown). Western blots of whole cell lysates showed that\nthe effect of BILF1 on the levels of cell surface MHC class I were\nreflected by a similar decrease in the amount of total cellular\nMHC class I heavy chains (Fig. 2B). Notably, the levels of TAP-1\nand TAP-2 components of the peptide transporter complex and\ncalregulin were unaffected by expression of BILF1 (Fig. 2B). Levels\nof TfR receptor were unaffected in 293 cells but reproducibly\nshowed a small increase, along with MHC class II, in MJS cells\n(Fig. 2B).\nThe aforementioned results raised the possibility that BILF1\nmight cause an impairment of the antigen processing pathway that\nwould affect antigen recognition by CD8+ T cell responses. To test\nthis hypothesis, HLA-B8 positive MJS cells were transiently\ntransfected with p509 plasmid together with control pCDNA3-\nIRES-nlsGFP vector or different amounts of pCDNA3-BILF1-\nIRES-nlsGFP. The p509 vector expresses BZLF1, an EBV lytic\nAuthor Summary\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus and an important\nhuman pathogen that can cause diseases ranging from\nnon-malignant proliferative disease to fully malignant\ncancers of lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Nevertheless,\nthe vast majority of people in all populations worldwide\nare infected with EBV. After primary infection the virus\npersists for the life of the infected individual, and usually\nwithout clinical symptoms. To understand how EBV causes\ndisease, we also need to know how this virus is able to\npersist in healthy individuals with potent immune-\nresponses. A picture is emerging which suggests that\nEBV, similar to non-tumorigenic herpesvirus, has multiple\nco-operating mechanisms to modulate immune responses\nby interfering with antigen processing pathway in cells\nundergoing lytic virus replication. We have now identified\nan EBV-encoded protein, BILF1, which targets MHC class I\nmolecules for lysosomal degradation, leading to impaired\nrecognition by immune T cells. BILF1 is a constitutively\nactive G-protein-coupled receptor, but its effect on MHC\nclass I degradation is independent of its signaling\nfunctions, and the molecular mechanisms are distinct\nfrom those identified in other viruses that induce\ndegradation of MHC class I. This work aids our under-\nstanding of EBV biology and emphasizes the complexity of\nmechanisms evolved by viruses to enable persistent\ninfection.\nEBV BILF1 Impairs Antigen Processing\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 January 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e1000255\ncycle protein that is the target of the HLA-B8 restricted \u2018RAK\u2019\nCD8+ T cell effector clone. Following co-culture of RAK T cells\nwith the transfected MJS target cells, the release of IFN-c was\nassayed by ELISA as a measure of T cell recognition. The\nrepresentative experiment in Fig. 3A shows that the RAK clone\ndid not respond to vector control transfected MJS, but showed\nclear recognition of cells transfected with BZLF1. This recognition\nwas inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by co-transfection of\nBILF1, exceeding 90% inhibition at the highest dose of pCDNA3-\nBILF1-IRES-nlsGFP transfected. Similar results were obtained in\n3 separate experiments. Western-blots of the transfected target\ncells (.. 3B) showed that BILF1 protein expression increased with\nincreasing amounts of pCDNA3-BILF1-IRES-nlsGFP plasmid, as\nexpected. Interestingly, the amount of BZLF1 protein also showed\na smaller but reproducible concomitant increase in expression,\npossibly as a result of constitutive BILF1 signaling (e.g. activation\nof NFkB; see below) enhancing the CMV promoter driving BZLF1\nexpression in p509. A similar inhibition of EBV-specific CD8+ T\ncell recognition by BILF1 was observed in additional experiments\nperformed with 293 cells transfected with the BMLF1 target\nrecognized by HLA-A2 restricted T cell clones (data not shown).\nIn healthy infected individuals, EBV latency is established in the\nB lymphocyte pool, which implies that at some stage lytic cycle\nmust occur in B cells for the virus to be transmitted to epithelial\ncells or other hosts. We therefore examined the effect of BILF1\nexpression in B cells. To simplify the experiment, we chose to use\nLCLs that had been established by infection of normal resting B\ncells with a BZLF1 knock-out recombinant EBV; this provided us\nwith a range of endogenous latent proteins as target antigens in a\ngood antigen-presenting host cell which was unable to enter lytic\ncycle and, therefore, unable to express BILF1 from the viral\ngenome. These LCL were transduced with a PLZRS-BILF1-\nIRES-GFP retrovirus, and 6 days later were stained for surface\nMHC class I and class II molecules with PE-conjugated\nantibodies. The GFP positive (BILF1+) population was shown by\nflow cytometry to express almost 40% less surface MHC class I\ncompared to the GFP negative (BILF12) population in the same\nculture (Fig. 4A). The expression of BILF1 did not affect the\nexpression of surface MHC class II molecules. The reduction in\nthe expression of surface MHC class I by BILF1 was smaller than\nthat seen in 293 and MJS cells (Fig. 2), but was reproducibly\nobserved in 3 experiments with two different LCLs.\nTo examine the functional significance of this BILF1-mediated\nreduction of surface MHC class I expression, EBV-specific T cell\nrecognition experiments were performed on GFP+ cells isolated on\na fluorescence activated cell sorter after transduction with either a\ncontrol retrovirus (PLZRS-IRES-GFP) or the BILF1 retrovirus\n(PLZRS-BILF1-IRES-GFP). These cells were used as targets in T\ncell assays with different effector cell clones specific for\nconstitutively-expressed latent EBV proteins. The representative\nexperiments in Fig. 4B show that CD8+ effectors specific for one of\nthree different latent proteins (EBNA1, HLA-B35 restricted;\nFigure 1.

Control and BILF1+ 293 cells were pulse-labeled with\n35S-methionine\/cysteine and chased at 37uC in medium contain-\ning cold methionine and cysteine. At each time point, cells were\nlysed in NP40 detergent buffer and immunoprecipitated with mAb\nW6\/32, which reacts with properly assembled MHC class I\ncomplexes.\nIn the first set of pulse-chase experiments, the immunoprecip-\ntated MHC class I heavy chains were treated with endoglycosidase\nH (Endo-H), an enzyme which deglycosylates newly-synthesized\nheavy chains but not the mature form that has been exported from\nthe ER. Most MHC class I heavy chains were Endo-H-sensitive at\nthe beginning of the chase, as expected for newly synthesised\nheavy chain in the ER. Within 30\u201360 min, nearly all heavy chains\nbecame Endo-H-resistant. The rate of conversion of MHC class I\nheavy chain to the Endo-H resistant form was similar in control\n293 cells and in BILF1+ 293 cells (Fig. 5A). These results indicate\nthat the export of MHC class I from the ER and its passage\nthrough the Golgi is not impeded by BILF1, and that BILF1 most\nprobably acts at a later stage.\nIn order to compare the half life of MHC class I molecules, cells\nwere pulsed with radiolabel for 15 min, then chased for up to 8 h\nbefore lysis and immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 5B (upper\nand middle panels), both MHC class I heavy chain and its\nassociated b2-microglobulin showed a half-life of around 8 h in\nthe control 293 cells, which was reduced to around 5 h in BILF1+\n293 cells. In the same experiment, immunoprecipitations of the\nTfR showed no difference between control and BILF1+ 293 cells\n(Fig. 5B, lower panel).\nIt is worth noting that over a series of experiments the\nincorporation of radiolabel into MHC class I molecules was not\nreduced in BILF1-expressing 293 cells relative to the control cells,\nindicating that BILF1 did not inhibit their translation.\nPhysical association of BILF1 with MHC class I complexes\nIn the pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation of MHC class I, an\nadditional co-precipitating band at around 33 kD was reproducibly\nobserved in W6\/32 immunoprecipitates of BILF1-293 lysates but\nnot in control lysates (data not shown). To test the hypothesis that\nthis band might be the smaller, non-glycosylated, form of BILF1 co-\nprecipitating with MHC class I, we carried out a second round of\nprecipitations on eluates from the W6\/32 precipitations. The\neluates were first diluted in lysis buffer, then equal aliquots were re-\nprecipitated either with a mAb to the HA-tag of BILF1 or with the\nHC10 mAb to MHC class I free heavy chain. As shown in Fig. 6A,\nre-precipitation of the W6\/32 eluate from BILF1+ 293 cells with\nanti-HA revealed a band at around 33 kD and a smear at 48\u201355 kD\n(lane 2) that were not present in the re-precipitation with HC10\nmAb (lane 4), and neither were they detectable in the anti-HA re-\npreciptate of the control 293 sample (lane 1). These experiments\nindicated that BILF1 associated with the MHC class I complex. It is\nalso worth noting that re-precipitation with HC10 mAb pulled\ndown a ladder of bands above the MHC class I heavy chain\n(indicated with asterisks in Fig. 6A), which probably represent\nubiquitinated MHC molecules; the intensity of these bands was\nindistinguishable between control 293 and BILF1+ 293 cells.\nTo confirm the association of MHC class I with BILF1,\nadditional immunoprecipitations were conducted with lysates from\nnon-radiolabeled cells. Here, control 293 and BILF1+ 293 cells\nwere again solubilized in NP40 detergent buffer, then immuno-\nprecipitated with W6\/32 (MHC class I), anti-HA (BILF1), or anti-\nTfR, before analysis by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6B,\nsome MHC class I molecules were co-precipitated by anti-HA\nmAb (lane 6, top blot), and some BILF1 molecules were co-\nprecipitated by W6\/32 mAb (lane 4, middle blot). In the control\nTfR immunoprecipitations, no co-precipitation of MHC class I or\nBILF1 was observed (lane 8, top and middle blots). Taken\ntogether, the radiolabeled and cold immunoprecipitation data\nprovide compelling evidence that BILF1 physically associates with\nthe MHC class I molecules. Indeed, since weak co-precipitating\nBILF1 bands were even seen immediately following a 15 min\npulse-label (data not shown), it is likely that the interaction first\noccurs in the ER.\nBILF1 is associated with MHC class I molecules on the cell\nsurface and increases their rate of internalization\nFor other viral proteins known to target MHC class I molecules\nfor degradation, three broad mechanisms have been identified:\neither they induce retrograde transport from the ER to the cytosol\nfor degradation by proteasomes, as exemplified by HCMV US2\nand US11 [9\u201311]; or they redirect them to endolysosomal vesicles\nfor degradation, exemplified by gp48 of murine CMV [28]; or\nthey trigger enhanced endocytosis of MHC class I from the cell\nsurface, followed by lysosomal degradation, as exemplified by K3\nand K5 of KSHV [29].\nFigure 3.

Confocal microscopy of BILF1-espressing 293 cells showed\nthat BILF1 was predominantly located in the plasma membrane\n(Fig. 7A). Since antibodies to the HA-tag engineered to the N-\nterminus of BILF1 allowed detection of BILF1 at the surface of\nviable cells, we were able to examine whether the association\nbetween MHC class I molecules and BILF1 can also be\ndemonstrated at the cell surface. Thus, viable control 293 and\nBILF1+ 293 cells were first incubated with W6\/32 (MHC class I),\nanti-HA (BILF1), or anti-TfR on ice to allow the antibodies to\nbind to the surface antigen. After removal of excess unbound\nantibodies by washing, the cells were then solubilized in NP40\ndetergent buffer and the antibody:antigen complexes precipitated\nwith protein A\/G beads. As shown in Fig. 7B, some MHC class I\nmolecules were co-precipitated by anti-HA mAb (sample 4, upper\nblot), and some BILF1 molecules were co-precipitated by W6\/32\nmAb (sample 2, lower blot).

We interpret\nthe differences between control and BILF1 cells in these latter\nexperiments to be due to the effect of the increased rate of\ninternalisation of MHC class I molecules that becomes apparent\nafter 20\u201330 min (see Fig. 7D, upper graph). Together, the results\nin Fig. 7A\u2013D suggest that BILF1 targets the mature MHC class I\ncomplexes for degradation after they reach the cell surface.\nLysosomal inhibitors block BILF1-induced degradation of\nMHC class I\nWe used a panel of inhibitors to identify the mechanism of\nBILF1-induced degradation of MHC class I molecules, including:\nbafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A, which can inhibit\nproteolysis by raising endolysosomal pH [30,31]; leupeptin, which\ninhibits cysteine and serine proteases [32]; and the proteasome\ninhibitor, MG132 [33]. Control and BILF1+ 293 cells were\nincubated with or without these inhibitors for 20 hr before\nharvesting the cells for Western blot analysis. The representative\nblot probed with HC10 in Fig. 8A shows that bafilomycin A1,\nconcanamycin A, and leupeptin all restored the level of MHC class\nI heavy chains in BILF1-293 cells to the same levels seen in\ncontrol-293. The blots from three independent experiments were\nquantitated by densitometry, and the mean values shown in the\nhistogram beneath the blot in Fig. 8A.\nFluorescence microscopy of BILF1+ cells treated with lysosomal\ninhibitors revealed a marked accumulation of intracellular MHC\nclass I staining that was not observed in BILF12 cells treated with\nlysosomal inhibitor (Fig. 8B), nor in BILF1+ cells treated with the\nproteasome inhibitor, MG132 (data not shown). Furthermore,\nquantitation of the total cell MHC class I protein in Western blots\nrevealed that the BILF1+ 293 cells retained their overall reduced\nexpression of MHC class I molecules relative to control 293 cells\nfollowing treatment with the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 8C).\nTaken together, the results in Figs. 7 and 8 suggest that the\naccelerated degradation induced by BILF1 occurs within an\nendolysosomal compartment following internalisation of MHC\nclass I complexes from the cell surface.\nComparison of BILF1\/GPCR homologs\nIt is well established that many, if not all, herpesviruses encode\nproteins with features of GPCRs [27]. The most closely related\nvGPCR to BILF1 amongst the human herpesviruses is the ORF74\nproduct of KSHV (a c2-herpesvirus), which shares just 15% amino\nacid sequence identity and 29.7% similarity with BILF1 (Fig. 9A).\nHowever, a more closely related herpesvirus , CeHV15 (a c1-\nherpesvirus, as is EBV), of the Rhesus Old World primate encodes\na BILF1 homolog sharing 80.4% amino acid sequence identity\nand 88.5% similarity with EBV BILF1 (Fig. 9A).\nFigure 7. BILF1 associates with MHC class I molecules at the cell surface and increases their rate of internalization. (A) BILF1 is\npredominantly localized at the cell surface. 293 cells stably transduced with BILF1 retrovirus were grown on glass slides, fixed and permeabilized, then\nstained with rat anti-HA (3F10) primary antibodies and Alexa FluorH 594 goat anti-rat IgG. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The stained\nslides were analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope, and the three photographs show different 1 micron-thick sections through\nrepresentative cells. BILF1 stained red, and the nuclei stained blue. (B) BILF1 and MHC class I molecules co-precipitate at the cell surface. 293 cells\n(26106) stably transduced with control (C) or BILF1 (B) retrovirus were incubated with saturating concentrations of antibodies specific for MHC class I\n(W6\/32), TfR (H68.4) or HA tagged BILF1 (3F10) on ice. After washing away excess antibody, the cells were lysed with NP40 detergent buffer, then\nprecipitated with protein A\/G beads and subjected to western-blotting as in Fig. 6B, using antibodies specific for MHC class I (HC10) and HA tagged\nBILF1 (3F10). (C) BILF1 increases the rate of internalization of MHC class I, but not class II, from the cell surface. MJS cells stably transduced with\ncontrol or BILF1 retrovirus were incubated at 0uC with saturating concentrations of mAb to MHC class I (W6\/32; top graph) or MHC class II (L234;\nbottom graph), then washed and incubated at 37uC for different periods of time.

The results in Fig. 10A are the\nmean of three independent experiments, and show that whereas\ntransfection of wt-BILF1 typically induced more than a 5-fold\nincrease in NFkB activity relative to the empty vector control\ntransfectant, the K122A-BILF1 mutant did not induce any\ndiscernable NFkB activation above the vector control. In both\n293 and MJS cells, transient transfection of the mutant K122A-\nBILF1 was able to cause downregulation of MHC class I (Fig. 10B).\nThese results suggest that the ability of BILF1 to target MHC class\nI molecules for endolysosomal degradation is not critically\ndependent upon its signaling function.\nDiscussion\nIn this study we have shown that the BILF1 protein, which was\nrecently identified as a constitutive signaling vGPCR [25,26], can\ndownregulate cell surface MHC class I and abrogate EBV-specific\nT cell recognition. The essential elements of the mechanism of this\nimmune evasion function have been elucidated. Pulse\u2013labeling\nand immunoprecipitation experiments with BILF1-transduced\ncells revealed that BILF1 associates with MHC class I molecules\nwithin 15 mins of biosynthesis. The MHC class I molecules can\nmature to the Endo H-resistant glycosylated form as normal, but\nwere more rapidly internalized from the cell surface and were\ndegraded by lysosomal enzymes. The effects of BILF1 on MHC\nclass I were not critically dependent upon the activation of G-\nprotein signaling, and were not exhibited by the most closely\nrelated human herpesvirus GPCR homolog, the ORF74 protein of\nKSHV, which has 15% amino acid sequence identity with EBV\nBILF1. Interestingly, the BILF1 homolog of a Rhesus c1-\nherpesvirus (CeHV15 BILF1, showing 80% amino acid identity\nwith EBV BILF1) did downregulate MHC class I similarly to EBV\nBILF1. This observation reinforces the degree of similarity in the\nsequences and functions of the EBV and CeHV15, and\nstrengthens the case for CeHV15 infection of Rhesus Macaques\nbeing an excellent animal model for understanding the interplay\nbetween immune responses and virus-infected cells during\npersistence of the virus in the healthy host and the development\nof virus-induced tumors [23,35,36].\nOur in vitro studies, identifying a new function for BILF1, add to\nthe complexity of the immune-evasion mechanisms of Epstein-\nBarr virus during lytic replication. EBV has now been demon-\nstrated to target the MHC class I antigen processing pathway at\nthe level of translation, through BGLF5 [22,24]; peptide transport,\nthrough BNLF2a [23]; and by targeting mature MHC class I\nmolecules for degradation, through BILF1. BGLF5 and BNLF2a\nare both products of early lytic cycle genes [24,37], but there are\nconflicting reports on the early\/late status of BILF1 [25,26,37].\nOur own results (D. van Leeuwen, unpublished) show that\ninduction of BILF1 mRNA expression during lytic cycle is\ninsensitive to phosphonoacetic acid treatment, indicating that it\nis an early gene, although its appearance is delayed relative to\nBNLF2a transcripts. The temporal expression of BNLF2a, BGLF5\nand BILF1 proteins and their impact at different points along the\nantigen processing pathway, suggest that their cooperative effects\nwill cause efficient abrogation of antigen presentation, particularly\nat the later stage of lytic cycle. This is consistent with the\nobservation that CD8+ T cell responses to late lytic cycle antigens\nare rare compared to the responses to immediate-early and early\nantigens [20]. It has also been suggested that the viral IL-10\nhomolog (vIL-10) produced by the BCRF1 gene might be involved\nin evasion from CD8+ T cell responses since vIL-10 can selectively\nreduce levels of TAP-1 mRNA, and therefore peptide transport, in\nhuman B cells [38]. However, since BCRF1 is a late gene, any\nautocrine effects of vIL-10 on TAP-1 mRNA would be masked by\nthe earlier expression of the host-shutoff protein, BGLF5 [22,24].\nIn the context of immune-evasion, it is likely that secreted vIL-10\nmay be more relevant to bystander B cells being infected by the\nvirus released from cells undergoing lytic replication in vivo,\ncoupled with the effects of vIL-10 on T cell and NK cell functions.\nBILF1 is a seven transmembrane segment GPCR which, like\nmany vGPCRs encoded by herpesviruses, shares structural and\nfunctional characteristics with chemokine receptors [25\u201327]. One\nrole of viral chemoreceptors is to contribute to efficient lytic\nreplication cycle by reprogramming the host cell through multiple\nsignaling pathways [27], a process that might aberrantly lead to\ncellular transformation and oncogenesis, as has been suggested for\nKSHV ORF74 [39\u201341]. In addition, it has long been recognized\nthat viral chemoreceptors have the potential to contribute to\nimmune-evasion strategies. For example, Bodaghi and colleagues\nreported in 1998 that one of the four vGPCRs of HCMV, encoded\nby US28, can modify the chemokine environment of infected cells\nby binding and internalizing MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant\nprotein) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell\nexpressed and secreted) to efficiently sequester these chemokines.\nIn certain cellular contexts, i.e. latent infection of monocytes with\nHCMV, US28 can also transcriptionally upregulate MCP-1\nFigure 10. BILF1 signaling function is not required to\ndownregulate MHC class I. (A) Wild-type or K122A-mutant BILF1\nexpression plasmids were transfected into the HEK293-NFkB reporter\ncell line, and the degree of NFkB activation measured by detection of\nluciferase activity.

Similarly to HCMV US28, the U51 GPCR of HHV6 is\nalso able to bind and sequester RANTES and MCP-1, but the\nHHV6 U51 additionally induces transcriptional downregulation of\nRANTES [44]. These examples of transcriptional regulation of\nimmune-modulating chemokines by vGPCRs of b-herpesvirus are\nlikely to be more significant in the lytic cycle of this virus\nsubfamily, where host protein synthesis shutoff is not a feature of\nlytic cycle as it is in a- and c-herpesviruses [22].\nOur observation with BILF1 represents the first example of a\nviral GPCR\/chemokine receptor interfering directly with the\nMHC class I antigen processing pathway. Interestingly, a similar\nphenomenon was recently reported for the cellular chemokine\nreceptor, CXCR4 [45]. Thus, CXCL12 ligand-induced activation\nof CXCR4 on malignant cancer cell lines and peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells triggered down-regulation of MHC class I from\nthe cell surface. Mechanistically, this process involves physical\nassociation of CXCR4 with the b2-microglobulin component of\nmature MHC class I complexes, ubiquitination of the MHC class I\nheavy chain, and endocytosis of MHC complexes into a late\nendosomal\/lysosomal compartment where degradation presum-\nably occurs. Although BILF1 is unable to directly associate with\nb2-microglobulin (JZ, unpublished data) and we have no evidence\nthat BILF1 induces ubiquination of MHC class I heavy chains\nabove the levels seen in control BILF12 cells (Fig. 6), CXCR4 does\nshare some broad features with the mechanism by which BILF1\ndownregulates MHC class I, which raises the possibility that\ntargeting of the antigen processing pathway might not be a\nproperty uniquely associated with the c2-herpesvirus BILF1\nvGPCRs. It is perhaps relevant that when co-expressed in the\nsame cell, BILF1 and CXCR4 show almost complete co-\nlocalization (both being present predominantly in the plasma-\nmembrane), whereas the KSHV-ORF74 and HCMV-US28\nvGPCRs (predominantly intracellular) exhibit separate localiza-\ntions to BILF1 [25].\nMany other viral gene-products have been shown to target\nMHC class I molecules for degradation. Some, such as the US3,\nUS10, US2 and US11 proteins of HCMV, target MHC molecules\nbefore they reach the cell surface, either by interfering with the\nmaturation of MHC class I molecules and their egress from the\nER [5\u20138] or by inducing retrograde transport from the ER to the\ncytosol with subsequent degradation by proteasomes [9\u201311].\nOther viral proteins, such as the KSHV K3 and K5 proteins\n[29,46,47], induce endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of cell\nsurface MHC class I complexes. Although BILF1 shares no\nobvious structural or sequence properties with any of these viral\nproteins, the mechanism of interference with MHC class I by\nBILF1 shares many features with those proteins that induce\nendocytosis of cell surface MHC class I molecules and subsequent\ndegradation. However, whereas, KSHV K3 and K5 proteins were\nshown to induce ubiquitination of MHC class I heavy chains,\nwhich appears to be a signal for endocytosis and subsequent\ndegradation [48,49], we found no evidence that BILF1 induced\nubiquitination of MHC class I heavy chains above the level seen in\ncontrol BILF1-negative cells. Furthermore, BILF1 lacks a plant\nhomeodomain (PHD) or RING-finger motif present in K3 and K5\nproteins that are necessary for their ability to induce ubiquitination\nof MHC class I molecules [49\u201351].\nSome viral proteins, such as murine CMV gp48 [28] and the\nHHV-6A\/B U21 proteins [52], contain dileucine motifs in their\ncytosolic C-terminus that have been shown to be important for\nlysosomal targeting of MHC class I complexes, but no dileucine\nmotif is present in the cytosolic domains of BILF1. The HIV-1 Nef\nprotein contains a typical di-leucine motif that is involved in the\nbinding of adapter proteins involved in membrane trafficking\n[53,54], although mutation of this motif does not affect the ability\nof Nef to downregulate MHC class I [55]. Indeed, although Nef\nwas one of the first viral proteins reported to induce endocytosis\nand degradation of MHC class I molecules from the cell surface\n[56], it is now unclear to what extent endocytosis of MHC class I\naccounts for its downregulation by Nef. An alternative explanation\nis that Nef acts predominantly by diverting intracellular MHC\nclass I complexes to endosomes and lysosomes before they can\nreach the plasma-membrane [57\u201359]. This would make Nef more\nsimilar to murine CMV gp48 which also diverts MHC class I from\nthe ER to the lysosomal compartment for degradation [28].\nSince BILF1 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane,\nour data on BILF1 suggest that endocytosis of surface MHC class I\nmolecules associated with BILF1 is likely to be the main\nmechanism of targeting the MHC class I molecules to the\nlysosome. However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that\nsome MHC class I molecules might also be diverted before they\nreach the surface. An investigation of what adaptor molecules can\nassociate with BILF1 will provide crucial information to elucidate\nthe finer details of BILF1\u2019s mechanism of action. It also remains to\nbe determined what are the sequence elements of BILF1 that are\ninvolved in its association with MHC class I molecules.\nExperiments are ongoing to resolve these unanswered questions.\nIt is perhaps surprising that BILF1 can inhibit T cell recognition\nso efficiently when it has a comparatively small effect on the levels\nof surface MHC class I (see Figs. 2\u20134). There are a number of\npossible explanations for this. First, BILF1 might target different\nHLA alleles with different efficiency. Thus, while HLA-A2, -B8,\nand B35 might be efficiently removed from the cell surface for\ndegradation, other alleles recognized by W6\/32 antibody may be\nunaffected and will mask the full extent that selected MHC\nmolecules are being degraded. Secondly, the association of BILF1\nwith MHC class I molecules in the ER might interfere with\nTapasin or TAP binding and thus interfere with correct peptide\nloading, while stabilizing a defective MHC complex and allowing\negress from the ER. Thirdly, the association of BILF1 with MHC\nclass I molecules at the cell surface might directly interfere with\nrecognition by TCR. None of these possibilities is mutually\nexclusive, and further work is ongoing to test them.\nIn summary, through identifying and partially characterizing\nthe molecular mechanisms of an immune-evasion function for\nBILF1, we have extended our understanding of the normal\nbiology of an important human pathogen. The discovery of a third\nEBV lytic cycle gene that cooperates to interfere with MHC class I\nantigen processing underscores the importance of the need for\nEBV to be able to evade CD8+ T cell responses during the lytic\nreplication cycle, at a time when such a large number of potential\nviral targets are expressed.\nMaterials and Methods\nPlasmids and retroviral expression vectors\nThe EBV lytic genes BMRF2, BILF1, BILF2, and BXLF2 were\nPCR-amplified from the B95.8 virus sequences, and LF1 and LF2\nfrom Raji EBV sequences, within the Bacterial artificial Chromo-\nsome (BAC) plasmid, 2089 [60]. The KSHV gene ORF74 was\nPCR-amplified from a KSHV BAC [61]. The BILF1 homolog of a\nRhesus lymphocryptovirus was PCR-amplified from a cosmid\nderived from the CeHV15 virus, [62] that was kindly provided by\nF. Wang (Harvard Medical School, Boston). All the viral genes\nwere subcloned into the EcoRI\/NotI sites of pCDNA3-IRES-nls-\nGFP vector with an additional 59-HA tag. All plasmids were\nEBV BILF1 Impairs Antigen Processing\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 January 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e1000255\nverified by restriction digest and sequence analysis. EBV BNLF2a\nwith 39-HA tag in pCDNA3-IRES-nls-GFP vector has been\ndescribed previously [23]. Expression plasmids p509, containing\nthe EBV BZLF1 gene, and pCEP4-SM, containing the EBV\nBSLF2\/BMLF1 spliced gene, have been described previously [24].\nTwo retroviral vector systems were used. The Retro-XTM\nUniversal Packaging System (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was\nused to prepare retrovirus based on the PQCXIH vector for\nhygromycin drug selection. The alternative vector, pLZRS-IRES-\nGFP, instead allowed coexpression of the marker gene GFP. The\nBILF1 gene with a 59-HA tag was subcloned into each vector.\nCells and transfections\nThe HEK293 epithelial cell line (American Type Culture\nCollection) and derived cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s\nmodified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal\nbovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. The\nHEK293-NFkB-luc cell line (kindly provided by G. Lipford,\nMunich) contained a stably transfected NFkB-luciferase promoter-\nreporter gene [63], and was maintained in medium supplemented\nwith 0.7 mg\/ml G418 as a selective agent. The MJS (Mel JuSol)\nmelanoma-derived cell line [64] was maintained in RPMI-1640\nmedium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and\npenicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. 293 and MJS cell lines\ntransduced by PQCXIH-based retroviruses were maintained in\ntheir medium with 400 mg\/ml hygromycin. For some experi-\nments, 293 and MJS cells were transiently transfected with plasmid\nDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). EBV specific CD8+\ncytotoxic T cells were grown in 10% FCS in RPMI-1640 medium\nsupplemented with 30% supernatant from the IL-2-producing\nMLA 144 cell line [65] and 50 U\/ml recombinant IL-2 as\ndescribed elsewhere [20].\nRetroviral infection\nFor the transduction of 293 cells and MJS cells, the packaging\ncell line (GP2-293) was transfected with retroviral vectors\n(PQCXIH or PQCXIH-BILF1) and PVSV-G to produce\nreplication-defective viral particles. The supernatants containing\nrecombinant retrovirus were harvested 48 hours after transfection,\nand filtered through a 0.22-mm pore, low protein-binding filter. To\ngenerate stable cell lines by transduction with PQCXIH-BILF1 or\ncontrol PQCXIH-BILF1 retrovirus, 293 cells or MJS cells were\ninfected with 1 ml retrovirus supernatants with polybrene added to\n4 mg\/ml final dilution. The stable cell lines were selected by\n400 mg\/ml hygromycin.\nFor retrovirus transduction of LCLs, the packaging cell line\n(GP2-293) was transfected with retroviral vectors (PLZRS-IRES-\nGFP or PLZRS-BILF1-IRES-GFP) and PVSV-G to produce\nreplication-defective viral particles. To generate stable cell lines by\ntransduction with these viral vectors, the LCLs were infected with\nretrovirus supernatants and the GFP+ cells were sorted on a\nCytomation MoFlo cell sorter at 72 hr post-infection.\nAntibodies\nThe BZ.1 murine mAb specific for the EBV BZLF1 encoded\nprotein was generated in the authors\u2019 laboratory [66]. Murine\nmAbs used to detect human MHC class I were: W6\/32 [67] which\nrecognizes native b2m-associated MHC class I (HLA-A, -B, and -\nC alleles) complexes; and HC10 [68], recognizing free HLA class I\nheavy chains. The DA6.147 murine mAb specific for HLA-DR a-\nchains was obtained from the ATCC, and mAb L234 [69] specific\nfor HLA-DR b-chains, was kindly provided by P. Cresswell\n(Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven). For flow\ncytometry experiments, antibodies for detecting MHC class I\nand class II were purchased from Serotec, including phycoery-\nthrin(PE)-conjugated anti-HLA A,B,C (MCA81PE; clone W6\/32)\nandPE-conjugated anti-HLA DR (MCA71PE; clone YE2\/36-\nHLK). The murine mAbs specific for the TAP1, 148.3 [70], and\nTAP2, 435.3, were kindly provided by R. Tampe (Wolfgang\nGoethe-University, Frankfurt) and by P.M. van Endert (Institute\nNecker, Paris) respectively. The murine mAb, H68.4, to human\ntransferrin receptor (TfR) protein was purchased from Roche\nDiagnostics, and Goat antibodies to calregulin (sc6467) were\npurchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rat mAb, 3F10, and\nmouse mAb, 12CA5, directed against the influenza virus derived\nHA tag, were purchased from Roche Diagnostics and Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology respectively.\nFlow cytometry analysis of cell surface MHC molecules\nCell surface expression of MHC class I on viable cells was\ndetermined by staining with PE-labeled W6\/32 antibodies or PE-\nlabeled isotype control mAb (both from Serotec) and detection on\na Beckman Coulter XL flow cytometer. The data were analysed\nusing Flowjo software (Tree Star).\nTo assay the kinetics of internalization of surface MHC class I\nand class II molecules, 293 cells or MJS cells were incubated for\n60 min on ice with saturating amounts of W6\/32 or L234 mAb,\nthen washed three times in phosphate-buffered normal saline\n(PBS) and replaced in warm culture medium and incubated at\n37uC for the length of time indicated in the results section. To\nterminate MHC\/antibody complex internalization, cells were\nrapidly cooled to 0uC. Finally, the mAb-bound surface MHC\nmolecules were stained at 0uC with PE-conjugated goat anti-\nmouse IgG2a antibody (Serotec), and cells were analyzed by flow\ncytometry.\nTo assay the kinetics of appearance of surface MHC class I, 293\ncells were incubated for 60 min on ice with saturating amounts of\nW6\/32, then washed three times in PBS, replaced in warm culture\nmedium and incubated at 37uC for the length of time indicated in\nthe results section. To terminate further appearance of new surface\nMHC-I, cells were rapidly cooled to 0uC. Finally, the newly\nappeared surface MHC-I molecules were stained with PE-\nconjugated W6\/32, and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.\nWestern Blots\nTotal cell lysates were denatured in reducing sample buffer\n(final concentration: 2% SDS, 72.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10%\nglycerol, 0.2 M sodium 2-mercaptoethane-sulfonate, 0.002%\nbromophenol blue), then sonicated and heated to 100uC for\n5 minutes. Solubilized proteins equivalent to 26105 cells\/20 ml\nsample were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate\/polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (SDS\/PAGE) on 4\u201312% gradient Bis-Tris\nNuPage mini-gels with MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen).\nFollowing electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes\n(Invitrogen) and blocking with I-Block (Tropix, Applied Biosys-\ntems) in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween-20 detergent,\nspecific proteins were detected by incubating the membranes with\nprimary antibodies at 4uC overnight. The 148.3 and 435.3 mouse\nanti-TAP1 and TAP2 mAbs were used at 1\/100 dilution of culture\nsupernatant, whilst the DA6.147 anti-HLA-DR was used at a 1\/\n250 dilution; the purified mouse mAbs, BZ.1, H68.4, 12CA5,\nHC10, were used at 1 mg\/ml; the rat anti-HA mAb was used at\n50 ng\/ml; and the goat antibody to calregulin, was used at 1 mg\/\nml. Primary antibodies specifically bound to blotted proteins were\ndetected by incubation for 30 min with appropriate alkaline\nphosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies, then were devel-\noped using a CDP-StarTM detection kit (Tropix, Applied\nBiosystems) and exposed to autoradiographic film. In one set of\nEBV BILF1 Impairs Antigen Processing\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 January 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e1000255\nexperiments, the alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated CleanBlotTM\nimmunoprecipitation dection reagent (Thermo Scientific) was used\nat a 1\/500 for 60 min to detect blots of immunoprecipitates being\nprobed with the HC10 mAb.\nT cell function assays\nThe effector T cell clone, RAK, specific for BZLF1 and\nrestricted through HLA-B8, was generated as described elsewhere\n[20]. Targets for the RAK clone were generated by transfection of\nMJS cells (HLA-B8 type) with a BZLF1 expression plasmid with or\nwithout a BILF1 expression plasmid. At 24 hr post-transfection,\nrecognition of target cells by the effector T cells was determined by\nELISA of IFN- c release using a standard protocol described\nelsewhere [71]. Briefly, 104 effector T cells were incubated for\n18 hr at 37uC in V-bottom microtest plate wells with 105 target\ncells, then the supernatants were harvested for quantitation of\nIFN-c by ELISA (Endogen) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommended protocol. Specificity control targets included HLA-\nmatched and HLA-mismatched EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid\ncell lines (LCL), empty vector-transfected MJS cells, and empty\nvector-transfected MJS cells pulsed with the RAKFKQLL\nsynthetic peptide.\nLCLs transformed with a BZLF12 recombinant EBV (to\nprevent induction of endogenous lytic cycle genes) were trans-\nduced with control PLZRS-IRES-GFP or PLZRS-BILF1-IRES-\nGFP retroviruses. These lines were used as targets in assays with a\npanel of effector T cell clones specific for constitutively expressed\nlatent EBV genes, EBNA1, EBNA3A, LMP2 or BHRF1. The\neffector T cell clone, HPV, was a CD8+ line specific for EBNA1\nand restricted through HLA-B35 [72]; clone YPL was a CD8+ line\nspecific for EBNA3A and restricted through HLA-B35 [72]; clone\nCLG was a CD8+ line specific for LMP2A and restricted through\nHLA-A2 [73]; clone PYY was a CD4+ line specific for BHRF1\nand restricted through DR4 (Kelly, G.L., Long, H.M. et al,\nsubmitted for publication). Recognition of target cells by the\neffector T cells was determined by ELISA of IFN- c release using a\nstandard protocol described elsewhere [71].\nMetabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Endo H\nDigestion\nCells (107) were starved with 15 ml methionine-free DMEM\nmedium supplemented with 10% dialysed FCS for 1 h at 37uC,\nthen labeled for 15 min with 200 mCi of EasyTag Express 35S\nprotein labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products) in a final volume\nof 1 ml. After two washes with chase medium (normal DMEM\nmedium supplemented with 10% FCS), the cells were resuspended\nat 26106 cells\/ml and chased at 37uC for the times indicated.\nSamples containing 26106 cells were lysed in 400 ml of NP-40\nbuffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM Tris-HCl,\npH 7.5) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) at 4uC for 45 min.\nNuclei and insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation, and\nthe supernatants were precleared first with 1.2 ml of normal mouse\nserum and 20 ml Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen) for 2 hr at\n4uC, and then again with 20 ml Dynabeads Protein A and 20 ml\nDynabeads protein G at 4uC overnight. The precleared lysates\nwere immunoprecipitated for 2 hr with 6 ml of W6\/32 Mini-\npermTM culture supernatant and 20 ml Dynabeads Protein A plus\n20 ml Dynabeads protein G, before washing the beads four times\nwith NET buffer (0.5% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl2, 5 mM EDTA\nand 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and eluting by boiling in reducing\ngel sample buffer for 5 min. For endoglycosidase H (Endo H)\ntreatment, 20 ml samples were incubated at 37uC for 2.5 hr with\n2 ml G5 reaction buffer and 1.5 ml of Endo H enzyme (New\nEngland Biolabs Inc.). For second-round precipitations, boiled\neluates were first diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer, then reprecip-\nitated as above with either HC10 (MHC class I heavy chain) or\n3F10 (anti-HA tag on BILF1). Finally, the samples were separated\nby SDS-PAGE on 10% Bis-Tris NuPage mini-gels with MOPS\nbuffer (Invitrogen). After the gels were fixed and dried, they were\nexposed to autoradiographic film.\nCold co-immunoprecipitations\nFor immunoprecipitations from whole cell lysates, 26106 cells\nwere lysed in 400 ml of NP-40 buffer with protease inhibitors and\nwere immunoprecipitated as above. Lysates were precipitated with\n1 mg of either W6\/32 (HLA-ABC), 12CA5 (HA-tag; BILF1) or\nH68.4 (TfR) mAbs. Eluted samples were separated on 4\u201312% Bis-\nTris NuPage mini-gels with MOPS buffer, electroblotted to\npolyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with antibodies\nHC10 (anti- HLA class I heavy chain), H68.4 (anti-TfR) or 3F10\n(anti-HA tag on BILF1). For the selective immunoprecipitation of\ncell-surface surface molecules, 26106 cells were incubated for\n60 min on ice with saturating amounts of W6\/32, H68.4 or\n12CA5, then washed three times in PBS. The cells were then lysed\nin 400 ml of NP-40 buffer with protease inhibitors and immuno-\nprecipitated with 20 ml Dynabeads Protein A plus 20 ml\nDynabeads protein G.\nImmunofluorescence staining of fixed cells\n293-BILF1 cells were grown on glass slides coated with\nfibronectin, and were treated with concanamycin A for 6 hrs.\nFor the confocal microscopy, the cells were rinsed with PBS and\nfixed with 4% (w\/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, then\npermeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. For\nconventional fluorescence microscopy, the cells were fixed and\npermeabilized with methanol-acetone (1:1 vol:vol) for 15 min at\n220uC. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies for\n2 hr at 37uC, washed extensively in PBS, then incubated with\nAlexa FluorH 488 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa FluorH 594 goat\nanti-rat IgG secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 45 min. After\nrepeated washing the slides were mounted with vectashield\nmounting medium with DAPI stain (Vector laboratories) and\nanalyzed with a Zies LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope,\nor with a Nikon E600 conventional fluorescence microscope.\nProtease inhibitor assays\n293 cells stably transduced with control or BILF1 retrovirus\nwere treated with Bafilomycin A1 (2 mM), concanamycin A\n(50 nM), or leupeptin (200 mM) or MG132 (10 mM) for 20 hr. All\ninhibitors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lysates from\n26105 cell equivalents were separated by SDS\/PAGE gel, and\nanalyzed by Western Blotting using antibodies specific for MHC\nclass I (HC10) and calregulin.\nNFkB reporter assays\nHEK293-NFkB-luc cells were seeded at 26105\/ml in a 96-well\nplate at 24 hr prior to transfection with a constitutively expressed\nRenilla-luciferase reporter construct (phRL-TK, 70 ng\/well, Pro-\nmega) for normalizing transfection efficiency, together with BILF-\nwild-type, BILF1-K122A mutant, or empty vector DNA (160 ng\/\nwell). The Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) and DNA mix in Opti-\nMEM medium was prepared according to the supplier\u2019s\ninstructions, and 50 ml was then added to each well. Cell extracts\nwere generated after 48 h using Cell Culture Lysis Buffer\n(Promega), and extracts were assayed for firefly luciferase and\nRenilla-luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System and\nRenilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega), respectively.\nEBV BILF1 Impairs Antigen Processing\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 January 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e1000255\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Fred Wang (Harvard), Andrew Hislop (Birmingham),\nDavid Blackbourn (Birmingham), and Alan Rickinson (Birmingham) for\nprovision of essential reagents and for critical review of the manuscript.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: JZ CSL MR.
