INTRODUCTION\nThere is considerable interest in the study of self-\norganized InAs-GaAs quantum-dot ~QD! structures. These\nare interesting both from a fundamental physics perspective,\nand also because of potential device applications, particu-\nlarly in the field of optoelectronics.1 Despite this, surpris-\ningly little is known about their detailed atomic and elec-\ntronic structure, including, for instance, the form of the\nground-state electron and hole wave functions. Initial struc-\ntural studies of uncapped Stranski-Krastinow ~SK! dots sug-\ngested a pyramidal shape,2 and several groups therefore con-\nducted theoretical investigations into the structure of ideal\npyramidal dots.2\u20137 More recent structural investigations\ndemonstrated that both the dot shape and size can vary with\ngrowth conditions. In addition to the ideal pyramidal shape,\nmore recent work has also provided evidence for \u2018\u2018trun-\ncated\u2019\u2019 pyramids,8 and for lens-shaped dots,9 as well as\nshowing that the indium composition can also vary through\nthe dot.10,11\nFigures in most theoretical papers on ideal pyramidal dots\nshow the presence of a permanent dipole in the dot, due to\nthe large built-in strain fields which localize the highest en-\nergy hole state near the bottom of the pyramid, so that it sits\nunderneath the lowest-energy electron state in the dot. Be-\ncause of the built-in dipole, QD structures should exhibit an\nasymmetric Stark shift in the presence of an applied electric\nfield. As an electric field F is applied, the transition energy\nETR between the ground-state electron and hole levels will\nvary quadratically as ETR(F)5ETR(0)2aF2bF2, where\nETR(0) is the zero-field transition energy, a depends on the\nbuilt-in dipole, and b is a measure of the polarizability of the\nelectron and hole wave functions. Asymmetry in experimen-\ntal measurements of the Stark shift have indeed revealed a\nbuilt-in dipole both in InAs-GaAs,12 and also in\nAlyIn12yAs-AlxGa12xAs quantum dots13 but, surprisingly,\nthe direction of the dipole is opposite to that predicted from\nthe theoretical calculations, with the hole center of mass\nabove the electron center of mass in both cases.\nHere we present a theoretical investigation of the factors\ninfluencing the sign and magnitude of the built-in dipole inPRB 610163-1829\/2000\/61~20!\/13840~12!\/$15.00realistic QD structures. We use a carefully chosen one-band\neffective-mass model to investigate how the dipole a and the\npolarizability b vary with dot shape, height, width, compo-\nsition, and composition gradient. Most structural investiga-\ntions suggest that SK dots have a broad base, tapering in-\nwards toward their top, and also have a large base-to-height\nratio.8,9,12,14,15 Here we consider ideal and truncated pyra-\nmids, and show that if one assumes constant composition in\nany such structure, then the built-in strain fields and large\nheavy-hole mass along the growth direction will lead to the\nhole ground state sitting near the dot base, below the elec-\ntron, giving the opposite dipole to that observed experimen-\ntally. We must therefore modify this simple picture. Because\nthe hole mass along the growth direction is considerably\nlarger than the electron mass, the hole tends to sit in the\nregion with the deepest potential while the electron is more\nwidely spread through the structure. In order for the hole to\nsit above the electron as observed experimentally, the deep-\nest potential must occur at the top of the dot. This can be\nachieved by increasing the indium composition from the\nbase to the top of the dot, consistent with the conclusions of\nrecent grazing-incidence diffraction measurements on un-\ncapped InAs-GaAs QD\u2019s.10 We show that there exist a range\nof graded composition, tapered dot shapes that can give the\ncorrect sign and magnitude for a . We also show that the\nmagnitude of the polarization term b is determined predomi-\nnantly by the vertical height of the dot. The calculated values\nof b are in good agreement with the experimentally deter-\nmined values when the dot height is assumed to be compa-\nrable to that determined from TEM measurements of equiva-\nlent uncapped dots.12 Our calculations, combined with Stark\neffect measurements, provide useful information and sen-\nsible constraints on allowed models of QD\u2019s, consistent with\na range of other experimental data.\nThe calculations were undertaken using separate one-band\nHamiltonian equations for the electrons and holes, the details\nof which are described in Sec. II. We include anisotropy of\nthe hole mass, and allow for a variation in the parameters and\npotential distribution due to built-in strain and compositional\nvariation. We show that the wave functions and confinement\nenergies calculated here for the ground-state electron and13 840 \u00a92000 The American Physical Society\nPRB 61 13 841THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTRON-HOLE . . .hole levels are in good agreement with data presented by\nother groups who used more sophisticated methods, such as\neight-band k\u0095P ~Ref. 3! and empirical pseudopotential4 tech-\nniques. Although such techniques are necessary for the cor-\nrect understanding of excited states in the dots, the linear and\nquadratic contributions to the Stark effect are determined pri-\nmarily by the spatial distribution of the ground-state wave\nfunctions and by their potential profiles, each of which is\nwell described here. The results of our calculations are pre-\nsented in Sec. III. We first show that the results for conven-\ntional pyramidal dots are in good agreement with previous\nwork, and reconfirm that the location of the hole below the\nelectron in such a structure gives the wrong sign for the\ndipole. We then consider truncation of the pyramid, showing\nhow the magnitude of the built-in dipole decreases with in-\ncreasing truncation, but always remains positive so long as\nthe dot tapers inwards toward the top. We explain this fea-\nture by using the calculated biaxial strain distribution within\nthe dot, which has the effect of making the effective width of\nthe top of the dot smaller for holes than for electrons, thereby\nmaintaining the dipole. The inclusion of a wetting layer for\nInxGa12xAs\/GaAs dots tends to make the dipole even larger,\nby acting to enhance the hole-trapping potential at the\ndot base while having relatively little effect on the ground-\nstate electron. We then consider the case of a dot whose\ncomposition increases from base to top, considering both\ncuboids and truncated pyramids. For both cases this can lead\nto a localization of the hole above the electron, as observed\nexperimentally. Looking at the polarizability b , we show\nthat this is a strong function of the dot height but is relatively\nunaffected by the base dimension, and so may be used to\nestimate the vertical dimension of the dots. Finally, we carry\nout a brief error analysis, investigating how variations in key\nparameters affect the overall results. We find that changing\nthe band-offset ratio or elastic constants used modifies the\nabsolute values obtained for ETR(0), a and b , but does not\nqualitatively affect the overall results. We omit the Coulomb\ninteraction in our calculations but argue, based on analytical\nexpressions presented as the Appendix, that this omission\nshould also not qualitatively affect the overall results. We\nsummarize our conclusions in Sec. IV.\nII. METHOD\nThe calculations were undertaken assuming a three-\ndimensional superlattice of dots, with superlattice unit cell\nsize 2Lx32Ly32Lz . Schro\u00a8dinger\u2019s equation for the system\nwas solved using a plane-wave envelope-function technique.\nThe normalized envelope function wave functions Cn(r) are\ndetermined using a Fourier series expansion\nCn~r!5(\nk\nAk\nn\nA8LxLyLz\nexp~ ik\u0095r!,\nwhere k5p(m\/Lx ,n\/Ly ,p\/Lz) and r5(x ,y ,z). We chose\n(umu,unu,upu)<(5,5,8) to ensure convergence, and chose the\nseparation between neighboring dots to be equal to the dot\ndimension in order to minimize cross talk, while also ensur-\ning efficient convergence of the Fourier series. We first de-scribe here the general method, and then discuss the particu-\nlar form of the strained one-band Hamiltonian equations\nused.\nUsing the plane-wave basis, the energy levels and eigen-\nfunctions were found by solving the large Hamiltonian ma-\ntrix equation:\n(\nk\nH\u00af k,k8Ak\nn5En(\nk\nAk\nn\n, ~2.1!\nH\u00af k,k85E\nr\ndr\n8LxLyLz\nexp~2ik8\u0095r!H\u02c6 ~r!@exp~ ik\u0095r!# .\n~2.2!\nIn order to set up the Hamiltonian matrix of Eq. ~2.1!, we\nmust first evaluate the matrix elements H\u00af k,k8 linking plane-\nwave basis states of wave vectors k and k8. The lattice con-\nstant of the quantum dot material (InxGa12xAs) differs from\nthat of the surrounding matrix ~GaAs! so that there will be a\nnon-uniform strain distribution throughout the dot and the\nmatrix. Both the electron and hole Hamiltonian equations\ncontain terms depending on this local strain distribution. The\ncalculation of the spatial strain distribution in a QD structure\nrequires the solution of a three-dimensional problem in elas-\nticity theory, for a generally nontrivial quantum dot shape.\nThis is often achieved by using finite-difference or atomistic\ntechniques,2,6,16 which require considerable computational\neffort. An analytical method was recently presented to calcu-\nlate the Fourier transform of the strain distribution,17 which\nwe use here to directly determine the strain-dependent terms\nin the Hamiltonian matrix. We assume for simplicity that the\ndot and matrix elastic constants are equal and isotropic, with\nthe values used given in Table I.\nWe define the characteristic function of the dot x(r) to be\nthe local indium composition in the supercell ~1 for InAs, 0\nfor GaAs!, and take the lattice mismatch of the dot \u00ab0 to be\n6.7% for InAs in GaAs. It can be shown for an isotropic\nelastic medium that the Fourier transform of the real-space\nstrain tensor component \u00ab i j(r) is given by (k9\u00de0),17\n\u00ab\u02dc i j~k9!5x~k9!\u00ab0F d i j2S C1112C12C11 D ki9k j9uk9u2G , ~2.3!\nwhere k95k2k8, x(k9) is the Fourier transform of the dot\ncharacteristic function, and C11 and C12 are the elastic con-\nstants. We wish to consider dots with a graded truncated\npyramidal geometry. We define the truncation factor f as the\nfraction removed from the top of the pyramid to give the\ntruncated pyramid. A truncated pyramid of height 2bz and\ntruncation factor f is therefore the bottom part of a full pyra-\nmid of height 2bz \/(12 f ). We have derived that when such\na truncated pyramid is centered at the origin of the unit cell,\nwith base 2bx , 2by , truncated height 2bz , and graded be-\ntween an indium fraction of f 1 at the base, and f 2 at the\n~truncated! apex, the characteristic function x(k9) is given\nby\n13 842 PRB 61J.

In order to evaluate this term, using a\nsimilar technique to that employed in Ref. 17 we Fourier\ntransform the Green\u2019s function for the piezoelectric potential\npresented in Ref. 20 and apply convolution theory, to obtain\nan analytic expression for the Fourier transform of the piezo-\nelectric potential (k9\u00de0)\nd\u02dc pz~k9!5\n218i\u00ab0\ne0A2p\nS C1112C12C11 D F e14barerbar x~k9!kx9ky9kz9uk9u4\n1S e14dot\ner\ndot 2\ne14\nbar\ner\nbarD(\nk-\nx~k-2k9!x~k9!\nkx9ky9kz9\nuk9u4 G ,\nwhere e0 , er\ndot\n, and er\nbar are the permittivity of free space\nand relative permittivity of the dot and barrier material, and\ne14\ndot and e14\nbar are the piezoelectric constants. In the diagonal\n~one-band! approximation used here, heavy holes have a\nlarge effective mass in the growth direction and a small ef-\nfective mass in the growth plane,21 so that the dominant con-\ntribution to the heavy-hole kinetic energy is directed parallel\nto the x-y plane. This contrasts with the light holes, where\nthe dominant kinetic-energy term is directed parallel to the z\naxis. From experiment, Stranski-Krastanow quantum dots\nhave a large base-to-height ratio, i.e, Lx5Ly@Lz . The ki-\nnetic energy in the x-y plane is thus reduced relative to that\nin the growth direction, leading to stronger heavy-hole con-\nfinement and weaker light-hole confinement. In addition,\naxial strain tends to reduce the light-hole confinement poten-\ntial through most of the dot.5,17 The one-band valence Hamil-\ntonian we use for the hole ground state is then given as\nH\u02c6 v~r!5\n\\2\n2m0\n$\u201e i@g1~r!1g2~r!#\u201e i\n1\u201ez@g1~r!22g2~r!#\u201ez%\n1Vv~r!1av\u00abhy~r!2bax\u00abax~r!\n1dpz~r!1eFz ~2.6!\nPRB 61 13 843THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTRON-HOLE . . .FIG. 1.

In order to correctly describe the one-\nband Luttinger parameters g i(r), we first relate them to their\neight-band counterparts, g i8(r). In the full eight-band Hamil-\ntonian, the interactions between the conduction-band mini-\nmum and valence-band maximum are considered explicitly,\nwith g i8(r) then due to interactions with remote bands, and\nassumed to be independent of the built-in strain and the\nlowest-energy gap.

We\ncalculated the parameter values for InAs in a GaAs matrix,\nand for unstrained GaAs, and then assumed a linear variation\nof all parameters with alloy composition. This assumption is\nconsistent with the parameters compiled by Krijn27. Al-\nthough the ~unstrained! band gap of InxGa12xAs has a mod-\nerately large bowing parameter, the strain contribution to the\nband gap introduces a bandgap bowing in the opposite direc-\ntion which almost exactly counteracts this.27 The calculations\npresented below were carried out assuming room-\ntemperature energy gaps and effective masses. The effective\nmass and Luttinger parameters quoted from Ref. 25 are 0-K\nvalues. These were related to the 300-K values by usingroom-temperature values for the strained energy gap in Eqs.\n~2.5! and ~2.8!. Finally, we assume the GaAs values for the\nelastic constants in the dot and surrounding matrix. We have\njustified this choice previously,17,28 based on Keyes\u2019 scaling\nrule for elastic constants.29,30\nIII. RESULTS\nFigures 1~a! and 1~b! show the variation of the ground-\nstate electron and hole confinement energies, calculated as a\nfunction of dot size for InAs pyramids of base to height ratio\n2:1 on a 1-ML InAs wetting layer. The results are in good\nagreement with previous calculations. Using the effective-\nmass renormalization procedure, we find several bound-\nelectron states. For the dot shape considered in Figs. 1~c! and\n1~d!, we find four distinct electron bound states within the\ndot. In Table II, we compare our calculated ground state\nconfinement energies for a dot of base 12 nm and height 6\nnm, with previous calculations.3,6 The calculated electron\nconfinement energies are in good agreement with previous\neight-band k\"P calculations,3 sitting midway between the\nTABLE II.

Our values lie about 10\nmeV above the electron energies calculated using the valence\nforce-field model, and about 10 meV below those calculated\nusing a continuum mechanical method. The hole ground-\nstate energy in Fig. 1~b! is consistently about 10% further\nfrom the valence-band edge than that calculated in Ref. 3. To\ninvestigate the cause of this difference, we have calculated\nthe hole confinement energy using our model and the band-\nstructure parameters from Ref. 3. The resulting confined\nstate energy is within 4 meV of that obtained using our pa-\nrameters. Most of the observed difference must therefore be\ndue to factors other than band-structure parameters, of which\nthe most important is likely to be the different force-field\nparameters used, and consequent differences in the biaxial\nstrain distribution. The difference is unlikely to be due to the\nuse of a one-band rather than eight-band Hamiltonian here. If\nwe were to include mixing between heavy- and light-hole\nbands in our Hamiltonian, these should tend to increase the\nground-state hole confinement, pushing the ground-state va-\nlence level further away from the GaAs valence-band edge,\nthereby increasing the difference between the two sets of\nresults. Reference 5 found a significantly larger hole confine-\nment energy, and smaller electron confinement energy than\nRef. 3. This is almost certainly due in part to a differing\ntreatment of the band offset. There are other important dif-\nferences between the two calculations, including the choice\nof a 1.5-ML wetting layer in Ref. 5, as opposed to the 1-ML\nwetting layer assumed in Ref. 3. This results in a 15-meV\nshift in hole confinement for the pyramid ~Table II!. Refer-\nence 5 also employed a different treatment of the electron\nand hole effective masses of strained InAs, taking an average\nof the results of empirical pseudopotential and ab initio\nlocal-density calculations, and finding values of g158.201,\ng253.253, and m*50.04. These compare to the strain-\nrenormalized one-band effective masses of g1510.601, g2\n53.836, and m*50.042 used for the present work. While\nthere is good agreement between the calculated electron ef-\nfective masses, the differences in g1 and g2 lead to different\nhole effective masses. The largest difference is seen for the\nhole effective mass in the growth direction, which is esti-\nmated from the strain-renormalized k\u0095P parameters to be\n0.341, whereas Ref. 5 estimated a significantly larger value\nof 0.590. The different choice of effective mass results in a\n20-meV shift in the hole confinement energy ~Table II!. The\ncomparisons in Table II indicate the range of envelope func-\ntion parameters currently used to model strained InAs\/GaAs\nquantum-dot structures. This range was considered in further\ndetail in Ref. 3, where it was concluded that the greatest\nuncertainty in the calculated confined-state energies is asso-\nciated with the assumed band-offset values, with differing\nassumptions concerning the elastic constants used also play-\ning a role. We shall present most of our results here assum-\ning the band-structure parameters listed in Table I. Calcula-\ntions are presented in Sec. IV, which show that reasonable\nvariations in the assumed band offsets or strain distribution\ndo not qualitatively affect the main conclusions of our work.\nFigures 1~c! and 1~d! show contours of constant probabil-\nity density, calculated for the ground-state electron and hole\nwave functions for a pyramidal dot of base 12 nm and height\n6 nm on a 1-ML wetting layer. The electron wave function isdistributed relatively evenly throughout the pyramid, while\nthe hole wave function is predominantly localized near the\ndot base as a result of the variation in the biaxial strain,\n\u00abax5\u00abzz2(\u00abxx1\u00abyy)\/2, through the dot. Because the base\nof the dot is wider than the top, it has been shown2,6,17 that\nthe base experiences a positive biaxial strain (\u00abax.0), while\nthe top is under negative biaxial strain (\u00abax,0). This then\nleads through the term 2bax\u00abax to a deeper well for heavy\nholes at the base than at the top of the pyramid. The combi-\nnation of the deeper well and large heavy-hole mass explains\nwhy the hole wave function is predominantly localized near\nthe dot base. In contrast, the electron Hamiltonian @Eq. ~2.4!#\ndepends on strain only through the hydrostatic component\n\u00abhy , whose magnitude is relatively constant through the dot.\nThe hydrostatic strain \u00abhy is exactly constant in the model\nused here, where we assume isotropic elastic constants of\nequal magnitude in the dot and barrier. \u00abhy is no longer\nexactly constant when we use anisotropic elastic constants17\nor different values of the elastic constants in the dot and\nbarrier.3 Nevertheless, we expect, based on the above analy-\nsis, that the hole will lie below the ground state electron in\nany quantum dot of uniform composition whose shape tapers\nfrom a broad base to a narrow top. Figure 2 shows the cal-\nculated difference between the electron and hole ground state\nenergies for the dot structure considered in Fig. 1 when an\nelectric field is applied along the pyramid axis. For the\npresent work, we follow the same convention as in Ref. 12,\nand have defined the applied field to be positive when it\nresults in the conduction- and valence-band edges moving to\nhigher energy above the dot and to lower energy below the\ndot, as illustrated in the inset to Fig. 2. Here, and for the\nremainder of this section, we use 300-K parameters rather\nFIG. 2.

Use of 300-K parameters, rather than 0-K parameters\nreduces the value of ETR(0), but has little effect on the cal-\nculated values of a and b . The solid line in Fig. 2 shows the\ntransition including the piezoelectric potential; the long-\ndashed line shows the transition with the piezoelectric poten-\ntial set to zero, and the short-dashed and dotted lines show\nthe transition using the dot and barrier parameters, respec-\ntively, for the piezoelectric potential everywhere. The close\nagreement between all of the above calculations occurs for\ntwo reasons: first, the piezoelectric potential is only signifi-\ncant near the corners of the pyramid,20 away from the re-\ngions in which the electron and hole wave functions are con-\ncentrated. Second, the piezoelectric potential has odd\nsymmetry about the ~100! and ~010! planes through the dot\ncenter, while the ground-state wave functions have even\nsymmetry about these planes, so that the piezoelectric term\ndoes not shift the ground-state electron and hole energies in\nfirst-order perturbation theory. These two factors explain\nwhy the piezoelectric potential has little effect on the\nground-state transition energy in ~001!-grown, zinc-blende\npyramidal dots. Setting the piezoelectric potential to the bar-\nrier value everywhere provides a good approximation of the\nfull piezoelectric potential calculation. While this would at\nfirst seem surprising given the factor of 4 difference between\ne14 \/\u00abr for the two materials, one should note that piezoelec-\ntric deformation occurs predominantly outside of the dot, so\nthat most of the overlap between the piezoelectric fields and\nthe charge-carrier wave functions will occur in the barrier\nmaterial. For dots whose composition is graded from\nInxGa12xAs at the base to InAs at the top surface, there will\nbe a smaller lattice mismatch between the dot and barrier\nmaterial at the base of the dot, reducing the atomic displace-\nment caused by the inclusion and hence weakening the pie-\nzoelectric field. As the pyramidal dot shape is truncated, the\npiezoelectric field becomes more concentrated at the corners\nof the dot while the electron and hole wave functions be-\ncome more strongly localized toward the center of the dot. In\nboth cases the piezoelectric shift in ground-state carrier con-\nfinement should be smaller than that seen for the pyramid.\nTest calculations have shown that the piezoelectric-induced\nshift in the ground-state transition energy is negligible in the\ngraded, truncated pyramids considered below.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 2 that for moderate fields the\ntransition energy varies quadratically with applied field, so\nthat ETR(F)5ETR(0)2aF2bF2. The linear coefficient a\ndepends directly on the initial separation of the electron and\nhole mean positions, i.e, on the built-in ground-state dipole\nmoment of the dot. This is confirmed using second-order\nperturbation theory. The electron and hole Hamiltonian\nequations may be written in the presence of an applied field\nas\nH\u02c6 5H\u02c6 01H\u02c6 8,\nwhere H\u02c6 0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian of Eq. ~2.4! or Eq.\n~2.6!, and H\u02c6 85eFz . The ground-state electron ~hole! wave\nfunctions Ce(h) are given to first order in the applied electric\nfield F as\nCe(h)5ce(h)\n0 1Fce(h)8 ,where ce(h)\n0 is the ground-state wave function in zero field,\nand the first-order correction Fce(h)8 is written so as to em-\nphasize that its magnitude varies linearly with F. From\nsecond-order perturbation theory, the ground-state electron\nenergy Ee then varies with applied field as\nEe~F !5Ee~0 !1eF^ze&1eF2^ce\n0uzuce8&,\nwhere ^ze&5^ce\n0uzuce\n0& is the mean electron position along\nthe pyramid axis. Using an equivalent expression for the hole\nenergy we see that the transition energy, ETR , varies to sec-\nond order as\nETR~F !5ETR~0 !2eF~^zh&2^ze&!\n2eF2~^ch\n0uzuch8&2^ce\n0uzuce8&!. ~3.1!\nThe linear coefficient a is therefore identically equal to\nthe ground-state dipole moment, a5e(^zh&2^ze&), while\nthe quadratic term b depends only on the polarizability of\nthe ground-state electron wave function, 2be \/e\n5^ce\n0uzuce8& , and of the ground-state hole wave function,\nbh \/e5^ch\n0uzuch8&.\nThe peak transition energy is seen at positive field in Fig.\n2, consistent with a negative dipole d5a\/e , with d528.8\n\u00c5 . By contrast, experimental Stark shift measurements both\non InAs\/GaAs ~Ref. 12! and InxGa12xAs\/AlxGa12xAs QD\nstructures13 show the peak transition energy at negative fields\nin the notation used here. The experimentally observed\nbuilt-in dipole is therefore of opposite sign to that predicted\nfrom Fig. 2 and Eq. ~3.1!, with the hole-electron separation\nd54.061 \u00c5 in Ref. 12. We therefore conclude that the\nstructure of these buried Stranski-Krastinow-grown dots\nmust be markedly different from an ideal constant composi-\ntion pyramid, and now turn to consider what dot structures\nare consistent with the experimentally observed dipole and\npolarizability.\nFigure 3 shows the calculated dipole in a truncated InAs\nFIG. 3.

The value assumed for H is\nsimilar to the value estimated from a TEM analysis of un-\ncapped dots, and also to that inferred from the value of b\nmeasured for capped dots.12 f represents the fraction of the\ntotal pyramid height removed so that, for example, a trun-\ncated pyramid with f 50.75 and H55.5 nm is formed by\ndecapitating a full pyramid of height 22 nm. The dashed line\nin the figure shows the dipole when a 1-ML InAs wetting\nlayer is included, while the solid line shows the dipole with\nno wetting layer. The wetting layer deepens the hole poten-\ntial near the base of the dot. The hole is always localized\nbelow the electron in this case, with d51 \u00c5 even for a\ncuboidal dot ( f 51) sitting on the wetting layer. Moving\nfrom a cuboidal to a pyramidal geometry, the increasing an-\nisotropy of the dot shape modifies the axial strain fields\npresent in the dot to move the heavy holes away from the top\nsurface of the dot and toward the dot base, so that the\nground-state hole moves more rapidly toward the dot base\nthan the ground-state electron, and the magnitude of the\nelectron-hole separation increases. For the dot dimensions\nconsidered, the electron-hole separation reaches a maximum\nat f ;0.35, and then decreases again for smaller f. At f\n;0.35, the hole is already predominantly localized at the\nbase of the dot. For smaller f, the increasingly pyramidal\nshape pushes the electron downwards more rapidly than the\nhole, so that the electron starts to \u2018\u2018catch up\u2019\u2019 with the hole.\nIt is clear that, regardless of the level of truncation, the mean\nelectron position will always remain above that of the hole,\nup to the limit of a cuboidal dot ( f 51). When we set f 51,\nand assume no wetting layer, the electron and hole wave\nfunctions are both symmetric about the cuboid central plane,\nso that in this case d50.\nIf the hole is to sit in the upper part of the dot, above the\nelectron, we require a deeper heavy-hole potential at the top\nof the dot than at the base. Experimental studies generally\nindicate a dot shape tapering from the base to the top. The\nheavy-hole potential can nevertheless be deeper at the top\nthan at the base if the dot is formed of an InxGa12xAs alloy,\nwith the indium composition, x, increasing from the base to\nthe top. We have assumed a linear composition gradient, but\nnote that recent work11 suggests that the true composition\nprofile may possibly be more complicated. Figure 4~a! shows\nthe calculated electron-hole separation d for dots with di-\nmension 1835.5 nm2. The solid line shows a linearly graded\ncuboid, for which d50 when x51 at the base of the pyra-\nmid, with d increasing to a maximum value of order 7 \u00c5 near\nx;0.3 at the base. A similar trend is observed for the trun-\ncated pyramid with f 50.75 ~dashed line!. The electron ini-\ntially sits above the hole here, but the positions reverse with\nincreasing grading. Figure 4~b! shows the calculated separa-\ntions when the cuboid and truncated pyramid are sitting on a\none monolayer InxGa12xAs wetting layer, with x constant in\nthe wetting layer and equal to the value at the dot base. For\nintermediate values of x, the wetting layer leads to a slight\nincrease in d, as the electron is pulled down toward the wet-\nting layer, but the hole remains pinned by the stronger axial-\nstrain induced deformation at the base of the dot. Moving to\nlarge x, the heavy-hole confining potential becomes stronger\nin the well than the dot, so that the hole is pulled morestrongly toward the wetting layer than the electron, shifting\nthe dipole toward more negative values.\nA fit to the experimentally observed electron-hole separa-\ntion of d54 \u00c5 can then be obtained for a variety of different\ndot geometries. We see from Fig. 4 that such a separation\ncan be obtained, e.g., for graded composition cuboids and\ntruncated pyramids both with and without a wetting layer,\nalthough the grading must be stronger in the presence of the\nwetting layer. Indeed a fit to the experimental separation may\nbe obtained for disklike dots, dome-shaped dots, etc. The\nStark shift data do not determine the precise detail of the dot\nshape, but do require severe compositional grading. The\nelectron-hole separation will vary in graded truncated pyra-\nmids, both as a function of the dot grading ~x! and the trun-\ncation factor f. This is illustrated in Fig. 5, which plots con-\ntours of constant electron-hole separation as a function of\ngrading ~horizontal axis! and truncation factor ~vertical axis!\nfor dots with a base width of 18 nm and height 5.5 nm,\nwithout a wetting layer. Interestingly, the data in Fig. 5 ex-\nclude pyramidal dots. Even with 100% linear grading from\nbase to apex and no wetting layer, the electron still remains\nabove the hole, giving a dipole of the wrong sign.\nFIG. 4.

The polarizability there-\nfore increases strongly with the quantum-well width. Most\nquantum-well studies have focused on wider quantum wells\n(H.;7 nm!, for which the heavy-hole contribution is con-\nsiderably larger than the electron contribution to the total\npolarizability, because mhh* @mc* .\nFigure 6~a! shows the calculated electron and hole polar-\nizabilities be and 2bh as functions of height H for a range\nof different test structures. These include a graded truncated\npyramid with base 18 nm, x50.5 and f 50.75 ~solid line!, an\nInAs cuboid with base 18 nm ~dashed line!, and an InAs\nquantum well ~dotted line!, each embedded in a GaAs ma-\ntrix.

This occurs because the small\nvertical dimension of the well restricts the motion of elec-\ntrons and holes within the well, so that the effects of barrier\npenetration become significant. This is confirmed by Fig.\n6~b!, which plots uc(z)u2, the integral of the probability den-\nsity function over the x-y plane, for several model structures,\nwhereFIG. 6. ~a!

The thick lines show the electron\nprobability density, and the thin lines show the hole prob-\nability density. It can be seen for H53 nm that the small\nelectron effective mass leads to a greater penetration of the\nelectron than the hole into the GaAs barrier, increasing the\neffective size He f f of the electron state, and hence increasing\nthe electron polarizability relative to the hole polarizability.\nThis also explains why the electron polarizability is largest in\nthe graded truncated pyramid, where the lower confinement\nenergy leads to increased barrier penetration compared to the\ncuboid, and hence larger, be . By contrast, the hole polariz-\nability bh is reduced in the graded truncated pyramid com-\npared to the constant composition cuboid and the quantum\nwell, reflecting the increased vertical localization of the hole\nwave function due to the variation in the zero-field heavy-\nhole potential along the axis of the dot.\nFinally we note that based on the above analysis we can\nobtain a very good fit to the experimentally observed Stark\nshift in InAs\/GaAs quantum-dot structures ~Fig. 7, solid\nline!.12 The fit is obtained assuming a truncated pyramid with\nbase 18 nm, height H55.5 nm, and truncation factor f\n50.81, and the dot graded linearly from x50.6 at the base to\nx51.0 at the top. This is slightly different to the dot shape\nwhich we presented previously,12 where x50.5 at the dot\nbase. This is due to minor changes in the way we treat the\nvalence effective mass and elastic parameters here. While the\ndot structure chosen is by no means a unique fit to the data,\nFIG. 7. Solid line: Fit to experimentally measured transition\nenergy ~300 K!, for a graded truncated pyramid with base 18 nm,\nheight 5.5 nm, and f 50.81, and graded linearly from x50.6 at the\nbase to x51.0 at the top. The fit to experiment differs slightly from\nthat quoted by the authors in Ref. 8, due to a slightly different\ntreatment of the valence effective mass and elastic parameters. Also\nshown are the calculated transition energies for: a 100-meV upward\nshift of the InAs conduction and valence-band edges ~dotted line!; a\n100-meV downward shift in these band edges ~dashed line!; and\nleaving band offsets unchanged, but using anisotropic elastic con-\nstants ~double-dot-dashed line!.its overall dimensions (B and H) are in good agreement with\na structural analysis of uncapped dots formed under identical\ngrowth conditions.12 For this geometry, we observe electron\nstates at five energy levels bound within the dot, two of\nwhich are singly degenerate, and three of which are ~nomi-\nnally! doubly degenerate. The calculated energy levels are\nfairly evenly spaced, with a separation between the ground\nstate and first excited state of 62 meV.\nIV. UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS\nThe one-band electron and hole Hamiltonian equations\nused here involve several parameters whose absolute values\nare still uncertain. It was shown in Ref. 3 that the values\nassumed for the conduction- and valence-band offsets are\nperhaps the most significant factor affecting the calculated\nelectron and hole confined-state energies. We have therefore\nrecalculated the variation of transition energy with electric\nfield, ETR(F), for the dot structure of Fig. 7, including rigid\nupward and downward shifts of 0.1 eV in the InAs band-\nedge energies. The results are indicated by the dotted and\ndashed lines, respectively, in Fig. 7. For an upward shift in\nthe electron and hole band offsets ~dotted line!, we see a\ngreater asymmetry in the Stark shift of the transition energy.\nThis is because the shift in the band offset leads to a deeper\npotential well for holes and a shallower well for electrons,\nincreasing the effects of the confining potential on the shape\nof the hole wave function, and reducing the asymmetry in the\nshape of the electron wave function. This would indicate that\neither a weaker compositional grading within the dot, or a\nmore tapered dot geometry, would be required to obtain an\nimproved fit in this case. The converse effect is seen for a\ndownward shift in the electron and hole band offsets ~dashed\nline!, which would then require either stronger compositional\ngrading, or a less tapered geometry to fit experiment.\nWe have omitted the influence of the exciton binding en-\nergy when calculating the interband transition energy. Two\nquestions need to be addressed concerning this omission:\nfirst, what is the typical magnitude of this binding energy;\nand second, how does it vary with electric field, and thereby\nmodify the calculated a and b values? The ground-state ex-\nciton binding energy is determined by the Coulomb interac-\ntion between the ground-state electron and hole states, as\ndescribed in the Appendix, and can be determined numeri-\ncally by carrying out an appropriate sum over the plane-wave\ncoefficients for the wave functions, and the Fourier transform\nof the Coulomb interaction.34 We choose instead to take an\nanalytical approach here, in order to derive general conclu-\nsions regarding the influence of the exciton binding energy,\nJeh . We see from Fig. 6 that the electron and hole probabil-\nity density distributions are close to Gaussians. The binding\nenergy Jeh can then be determined analytically for several\ncases, as described in the Appendix. For the electron, we\nestimate that Le52.86 nm in the growth direction and Be\n55.55 nm in the growth plane. For the hole, Lh51.58 nm\nand Bh55.17 nm. For simplicity, we take the relative per-\nmittivity to be the InAs value here. When the electron and\nhole sit on top of each other, with no built-in dipole, the\nexciton binding energy is then estimated from Eq. ~A5! as\n17.7 meV. This value is comparable to previous calculations\nof the exciton binding energy in dots of similar\nPRB 61 13 849THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTRON-HOLE . . .dimension,32,33 and with that obtained for pyramidal dots of\nsimilar base dimension.3 When the electron and hole are dis-\nplaced vertically to create a dipole of length d, the binding\nenergy initially decreases quadratically with d, as confirmed\nin Fig. 2 of Ref. 33. We estimate from Eq. ~A9! that, for\nsmall d, Jeh varies as Jeh(d)5(17.7\u2013 0.324 d2)(nm2) meV\nfor the B and L values listed above. For the dot shape of Fig.\n7, the built-in dipole d5^zh&2^ze& changes by approxi-\nmately 1 \u00c5 for every 24-kV\/cm change in applied electric\nfield F. Based on this analysis, inclusion of the exciton bind-\ning energy and its field dependence would therefore shift the\ncalculated curve in Fig. 7 downward by ;20 meV, and re-\nduce the calculated polarizability by about 3%. Preliminary\nnumerical calculations indicate that this analytical model un-\nderestimates the variation of Jeh(d) but that, nevertheless,\nthe effects of the exciton binding energy can be accounted\nfor by slightly increasing the dot height, and decreasing the\nradius of the dot compared to the value of the fit in Fig. 7.\nThe one-band model should be appropriate to describe the\nelectron confinement energies and wave functions, but may\nintroduce a systematic error into the calculated valence-band\nground-state energies and wave functions, as we ignore mix-\ning effects with the light-hole bands. The ground-state wave\nfunction in the pyramidal dot of base width 13.6 nm consid-\nered in Ref. 3 had less than 10% light-hole character,35 so\nthat a considerable vertical displacement of the light-hole\ncenter of mass with respect to the heavy-hole center of mass\nwould be required to significantly modify the average\nground-state hole position. This is not the case. Both heavy-\nand light-hole components of the ground-state hole level lie\ntoward the base of the dot for this dot shape.35 We thus\nexpect that use of a full valence-band Hamiltonian might\nalter the precise detail of the calculated dipole moments and\npolarizabilities, but should not significantly change the over-\nall conclusions of this work.\nThe other approximation made here which needs further\nconsideration is the assumption of isotropic elastic constants.\nIt has been shown17 that, since the QD shape has a lower\nsymmetry than that of the elastic parameters, the asymmetry\nof the dot shape dominates in determining the strain distri-\nbution, so that the isotropic and anisotropic models should\ngive similar results. However, whereas \u00abhy is exactly con-\nstant within the dot for the case of isotropic elastic constants,\n\u00abhy is observed to vary with position when anisotropic cubic\nelastic constants are used, with \u00abhy increasing approximately\nlinearly along the central axis of a constant composition\npyramid.3,17 This will give an additional linear variation of\nthe conduction- and valence-band edge energies along the\ndot axis. We have therefore calculated the electron and hole\nwave functions for the anisotropic case, replacing the isotro-\npic strain tensor of Eq. ~2.3! with the anisotropic, cubic,\nstrain tensor from Ref. 17. For the pyramidal dot structure\nconsidered in Fig. 1~b!, the position of the hole wave func-\ntion is predominantly determined by the axial strain distribu-\ntion, which maintains the same shape for both isotropic and\nanisotropic models, so that the position of the hole is unaf-\nfected by the introduction of cubic anisotropy. The electron\nwave function experiences a shift of 1 \u00c5 toward the base of\nthe dot, as hydrostatic strain introduces a potential gradient\ntoward the dot base. This shift in electron position is an order\nof magnitude too small to reverse the sign of the zero-fielddipole. Considering the graded truncated dot shape of Fig. 7,\nthe shift in the hole position is again relatively small, and the\nelectron position shifts ;0.3 \u00c5 toward the base of the dot.\nThe Stark shift calculated using anisotropic elastic constants\nis plotted as the double-dot dashed line in Fig. 7. There is a\nblueshift of about 20 meV compared to the isotropic case,\nand the peak position is not significantly different from the\nresults for the isotropic model. In this case, a better fit to\nexperiment could be obtained with a slightly larger dot base\ndimension. We conclude that the use of anisotropic elastic\nconstants would also not significantly modify our results.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have used one-band electron and hole Hamiltonian\nequations to investigate the different factors influencing the\nmagnitude and sign of the built-in dipole in strained\nInxGa12xAs quantum-dot structures, and also investigated\nthe polarizability of the dots. We have demonstrated that the\nbuilt-in strain will always lead to the hole center of mass\nlying below the electron center of mass in a constant com-\nposition dot whose cross-sectional area tapers from the base\nto the top. The inclusion of an InAs wetting layer further\nincreases the magnitude of the electron-hole dipole. The cal-\nculated dipole moment is of opposite sign to that determined\nfrom recent quantum-confined Stark effect experimental\nmeasurements.12,13 We show that the correct sign and mag-\nnitude of dipole can be obtained if we include composition\ngrading, with the indium composition increasing from the\nbase to the top of the tapered dot. This conclusion is also\nconsistent with the results of recent grazing-incidence dif-\nfraction measurements on uncapped dots.10 The theoretical\nanalysis presented here, combined with relevant experimen-\ntal data, has provided microstructural information which\nmust be taken into account in future studies of self-organized\nquantum-dot structures. Our results demonstrate conclu-\nsively that the measured Stark effect in self-organized\nquantum-dot structures cannot be explained by assuming a\npyramidal dot shape.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Igor Itskevich, Maurice\nSkolnick, David Mowbray, and Paul Fry for much useful\ndiscussion on Stark shifts, and also James Downes, Gary\nPearson, and Aleksey Andreev for useful discussions on\nstrain.

In this case, the electron and\nhole probability densities are given, respectively, by\nuCe~re!u25\n1\np3\/2LeBe\n2 expF2 ~ze1d\/2!2Le2 2 re\n2\nBe\n2G , ~A2!\nuCh~rh!u25\n1\np3\/2LhBh\n2 expF2 ~zh2d\/2!2Lh2 2 rh\n2\nBh\n2G , ~A3!\nwhere Le and Lh describe the extent of the electron and hole\nlocalization along the growth (z) direction, Be and Bh de-\nscribe their in-plane extent, and the electron and hole are\ncentered a distance d apart. It can be shown that the value of\nthe integral ~A1! is unchanged when we replace Le and Lh\nand Be and Bh by\nL5ALe21Lh22 , B5A\nBe\n21Bh\n2\n2 ,\nrespectively. We solve Eq. ~A1! by making the change of\nvariables u5(re2rh) and v5(re1rh). We can then find\nanalytical expressions for Jeh in several limiting cases.\n~i!
