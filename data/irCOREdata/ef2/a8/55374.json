Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al                          \n \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation \n\/World Health Organisation (FAO\/ \nWHO) defines vinegar as a liquid fit for \nhuman consumption exclusively pro-\nduced from agricultural raw material, \ncontaining starch and sugars by a \ndouble alcoholic and acetic fermenta-\ntion process. 1 \nThere are many kinds of vinegar \naccording to the raw material used in its \nproduction. The European legislation \nallows eight different sources to be \nused, namely: wine, fruits, cider, \nalcohol distilled from agricultural \nmaterial, cereals, malt, honey and \nbuttermilk.2 \nThe main constituent of vinegar is \nacetic acid, whatever the raw substrate. \nIt is expressed in acetic degree (grams \nof acetic acid per 100 millilitres of \nvinegar) at 20 \u00ba C. In the Spanish \nlegislation3, the total acidity of vinegar \nexpressed in acetic acid must not be \nlower than 50 g\/l, except for wine \nvinegar, which must be at least 60 g l-1. \nIndustrial production of vinegar \nfrom ethanol tries to obtain the highest \namount of the final product, but is not \nrecommendable to lead the process to \nexhaustion because acetic bacteria in \nthe absence of their substrate can \ndegrade acetic acid to CO2 and H2O. \nThus, a residual alcohol content lower \nthan 1% (v\/v) can be found in industrial \nprocesses, whereas in traditional pro-\nduction of vinegar from wine the \nresidual alcohol level is 2-3 % (v\/v). \nThis alcohol combines with organic \nacids to yield esters which endow \nvinegar with the characteristic flavour \nand smell. \nEthanol and acetic acid values are \nfrequently monitored during the overall \nacetic fermentation process. Traditional \nmethods for analysing these parameters \nconsist of, (a) for ethanol, distillation of \nethanol, addition of a given volume of a \nstandard solution of potassium di-\nchromate and back titration of the \nexcess of this reagent,4 and (b) for \nacetic acid, direct titration with sodium \nhydroxide in the presence of \nphenolphthalein.5 Both are time-con-\nsuming methods.  \nAlternative methods based on flow \ninjection analysis for measurement of \nacetic acid content in vinegars are \nscarce.  Gama et al.6 developed a meth-\nod for this analyte using an antimony \nelectrode, with sufficient precision for \nroutine analysis. Sch\u00fcgerl et al.7 \nimplemented a flow injection on-line \nenzymatic method based on sarcosine \noxidase for the determination of acetate, \nbut it was not used for vinegar.  \nAnother approach to the determination \nof total acidity of vinegars was \ndeveloped by Cardwell et al.8 using \ndiscontinuous flow analysis and \nphotometric end-point detection, and \nHonorato et al. proposed a mono-\nsegmented flow titration with spectro-\nphotometric detection.9  \nFlow injection methods for the \ndetermination of ethanol widely applied \nin wines, can be divided according to \nthe presence or absence of a prior \nseparation of the analyte, or the use of \nan enzymatic or chemical derivatisation \nreaction. Most non-enzymatic methods \nAnalyst, 2001, Vol. 126, 1177-1181   \n \n \n 3\nshow a linear ranges of ethanol \nconcentration higher that those existing \nin vinegars, which make them \ninapplicable for this purpose. There are \nno enzymatic methods in the literature \nfor the determination of ethanol in \nvinegar. \nIn this work a continuous, flow \ninjection method which integrates a \npervaporation module for the sequential \ndetermination of ethanol and acetic acid \nwas developed. Analytical pervapo-\nration10,11 permits the removal of \nethanol from vinegar while acetic acid \nis determined without the help of any \nseparation step. No similar, sequential \nor simultaneous, systems for these \nparameters have been reported pre-\nviously. \n \nExperimental \n \nApparatus and instruments  \nThe manifold used is shown in Fig.1. It \nwas built using a four-channel Gilson \nMinipuls-3 peristaltic pump (Villiers le \nBel, France), fitted with a rate selector; \nthree Rheodyne 5041 injection valves \n(Elkay, Galway, Ireland), one of them \nused as selecting valve, and PTFE \ntubing of 0.5 mm i.d. (Scharlau, \nBarcelona, Spain). A Philips PU8625 \nUV-visible spectrophotometer (Philips, \nCambridge, U.K.), equipped with a \nHellma 138-QS flow-cell (Hellma, \nJamaica, NY) and a Knauer recorder \n(Scharlau) was also used. \nA Selecta Tectrom bio water-bath \n(Barcelona, Spain), a laboratory-made \npervaporation module, described else-\nwhere 9,10 and PTFE membranes of 47 \nmm diameter and 1.5 mm thickness \nfrom Trace (Braunschweig, Germany) \nwere used. Measurements of acetic acid \nwere made with a Crison (Barcelona, \nSpain) Compact Titrator D, mod. D-33. \n \nReagents and solutions \nStandard solutions both for opti-\nmisation studies and calibration were \nprepared from acetic acid and absolute \nethanol, both from Panreac (Barcelona, \nSpain). \nFor the proposed method, the \nacceptor stream of the pervaporation \nmodule was an aqueous solution of 46 g \nl-1 potassium dichromate and 8,5 M \nsulphuric acid both from Panreac. The \nindicator-buffer solution consisted of a \n0,2 M aqueous solution of potassium \nchloride (Panreac), 0,25 M or 0,5 M  of \nsodium hydroxide (Panreac) and 9x10-5 \nM of Thymol Blue (Merck, Darmstadt, \nGermany), adjusted to pH 12,5. \nFor the official method  for ethanol \nin vinegar,3 an aqueous solution of  \n33,608 g l-1 of potassium dichromate \n(Panreac), 135 g l-1 of ammonium iron \n(II) sulphate hexahydrate (Panreac) in \n0,4 M of sulphuric acid (Panreac), an \naqueous solution 9,5 M sulphuric acid \n(Panreac), aqueous solution of 6,95 g l-1 \niron(II) sulphate heptahydrate with \n14,85 g l-1 of 1,10-phenantroline used \nas indicator,  and a 4 M solution \ncalcium hydroxide were used. \nThe reference method used for \ndetermining acetic acid in vinegar \nrequired a 0,1 N standardised solution \nof sodium hydroxide (Panreac).  \n . \n. \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al                          \n \n \n 4 \nReference procedures \nThe reference procedure in Spanish \ncellars for the determination of ethanol \nin vinegar is based on the photometric \ndetection of  Cr+3 at 600 nm, formed by \noxidation of ethanol after distillation of \nthe vinegar.4 Sodium hydroxide was \nadded to 200 ml of vinegar up to pH \n10-11 and then distilled and collected in \na 100 ml flask. A 20 ml volume of \ndiluted sulphuric acid and 20 ml of \npotassium dichromate were added to 10 \nml of distillate and the mixture was \nallowed to stand for 30 min. The excess \nof potassium dichromate was titrated \nwith ammonium iron(II) sulphate in the \npresence of 1,10-phenantroline.  \nThe reference method used for the \ndetermination of acetic acid in vinegar \nsamples was based on titration with 0,1 \nM sodium hydroxide using an automat-\ned potentiometric titrator. 5   \n \nProposed method \nFigure 1 shows the manifold used for \nthe sequential determination. The sam-\nple was introduced into the loops of the \ninjection valves, IV1 and IV2, by \naspiration. First, the content of IV1 was \ninjected into a stream of water and led \nto the donor chamber of the pervapo-\nration unit, after mixing with an \naqueous buffer solution of sodium \nhydroxide, potassium chloride and \nThymol Blue. The indicator showed \nwhether the pH of the solution was >8. \nThe ethanol was pervaporated and \ncollected in the acceptor solution \ncontaining potassium dichromate and \nsulphuric acid. The pervaporated \nethanol was oxidised and the Cr+3 \nformed driven to the spectro-\nphotometer and monitored at 600 nm. \nAfter the maximum absorbance signal \nhad been reached, IV3 was switched \nand the channel from R2 was selected; \nthus, the new baseline for the acetic \nacid determination was established.  \nThen, sample in the loop of IV2 was \nintroduced into the carrier stream \n(water) which flowed parallel to the \npervaporation unit and merged with a \nbuffer stream of indicator. The change \nin the colour of the resulting stream was \nFigure 1.

The range over which the \nvariables were studied and the optimum \nvalues found are given in Table 1.  \n \nOptimisation of the method for the \ndetermination of ethanol \nVariables such as the concentration of \nK2Cr2O7 and that of H2SO4, and as the \nflow-rate and temperature were studied \nusing a multivariate approach. \nThe concentration of K2Cr2O7 and \nH2SO4 in the acceptor stream were \nstudied in the range 15-60 g l-1 and 370-\n900 g l-1, respectively, and plotted \nversus the absorbance (Fig. 2). These \nvariables were studied in a previous \nwork12 and the optimum values found \nthere were used as the starting point for \nthis optimisation study. The signal \nincreased with increasing concentration \nof K2Cr2O7 and H2SO4 approximately in \nthe same ratio, but at a high concen-\ntration potassium dichromate precipi-\ntated. Concentrations of 46 g l-1 \npotassium dichromate and 830 g l-1 \nsulphuric acid were selected as a \ncompromise between absorbance and \nreagent consumption.  \nThe flow rates q1 and q2 in Fig. 1 \n(corresponding to the acceptor and \ndonor streams, respectively) were set at \nthe same value in order to avoid mem-\nbrane deformation, and this common \nvalue was changed between 0,8-1,8 ml \nmin-1. The flow rate for q3 was the same \nas for q1 and q2. Fig. 3 shows the surface \nobtained on plotting the flow rate and \ntemperature versus the absorbance.  \n \nTable 1.

The range 40-\n90 \u00baC was tested. A temperature of 80 \n\u00baC and a flow rate of 1,6 ml min-1 were \nselected as a compromise between \nabsorbance and sampling frequency.  \nThe analytical signal was higher \nwith increased injection volumes. The \nrange tested was from 1 to 2,5 ml and a \nvalue of 2,0 ml was selected as the \nanalytical signal levelled off at higher \nvalues. The function of reactor R1 was \nthe homogenisation of the chemical \nreagents\/pervaporated analyte before \nreaching the spectrophotometer. A \nlength of 50 cm was sufficient for this \npurpose. \nThe amount of pervaporated ethan-\nol during the passage of the injected \nsample through the lower chamber of \nthe separation module was efficient to \nprovide absorbance values between 0,3 \nand 1,6 for the concentration range of \nthis analyte in vinegar. Hence pre-\nconcentration approaches consisting of \nstopping the acceptor solution for \nenrichment in the volatile compound \nwere unnecessary.  \nThe buffer-indicator stream of flow \nrate q4 was split and the channel which \nmerged with that from IV1 had the \nfunction of leading the sample to basic \npH prior to reaching the pervaporation \nunit in order to avoid evaporation of \nvolatile compounds in their protonated \nform, such as formaldehyde and \nacetaldehyde. The presence of the indi-\ncator showed whether or not this \npurpose was achieved. \n \nOptimisation of the method for acetic \nacid  \nThe variables which affect the method \nfor the determination of acetic acid \nwere studied using the univariate \napproach because of the simplicity of \nboth the chemical and dynamic \nsystems. The most important para-\nmeters were the concentration of buffer \nand indicator. The type of buffer was \ntaken from the literature13 and modified \nas required. For a hydroxide-chloride \nbuffer with a fixed concentration of  0,2 \nM potassium chloride, the concen-\ntration of sodium hydroxide was varied \nin the range of 0,1-0,75 M. The wide \nrange of acetic acid concentration \nduring the fermentation process (from 0 \nto 10 g acetic acid  per 100 ml) made \nnecessary two concentrations of buffer \nin order to encompass the whole range \nwithout loss of linearity (namely those \nwith 0,25 and 0,5 M NaOH). The \nconcentration of Thymol Blue was  \n9x10-5 M, which provided changes of \nabsorbance between 0,5 and 1,5 for a q4 \nof 1,2 ml min-1.The length of reactor R2 \nwas tested from 0 to 75 cm. Values \nlonger than 50 cm did not change the \nanalytical results. The injection volume \nwas studied in the range 25-100 \u03bcl, and \nan optimum value of 40 \u03bcl was \nobtained. \n \nCharacterisation of the methods \nA preliminary calibration curve for \neach analyte was constructed sepa-\nrately, then calibration curves were \nJ.

Two linear ranges were \nfound for ethanol, between 0-4% (v\/v) \nand 4-12% (v\/v). Two calibration \ncurves were constructed for acetic acid \nusing two buffer solutions (0,25 M or \n0,5 M NaOH) depending on the acetic \nacid  content, 0-5% and 5-10%, respec-\ntively. \n \nSequential calibration \nThere was no interference from acetic \nacid in the determination of ethanol as \nthe pervaporated acid is not oxidised by \ndichromate. Calibration curves for both \nacetic acid and ethanol were con-\nstructed using a series of six standards \nof ethanol-acetic acid mixtures with \nconcentrations between 0-10% (v\/v) \nand 0-12% (grams of acetic acid in 100 \nml), respectively. The standards with a \nhigher ethanol concentration contained \nthe smaller acetic acid contents as in \nnatural samples. No statistically signifi-\ncant differences between the results of \nthe individual and sequential calibration \nwere found.  \n \nAssessment of the proposed method \nThirty different vinegars and acetic \nfermentation samples were used in the \nassessment study. Each datum was the \naverage of three determinations. The \nprotocol for assessment consisted of \nstudying analytical parameters such as \nlinearity range, traceability with a \nreference method, repeatability, re-\nproducibility, detection and quan-\ntification limits and sample throughput.  \n \nRepeatability (r)  \nThe Snedecor test14 was applied in \norder to establish if the differences \nbetween the repeatability of the meth-\nods were significant. With this aim, the \nFobs=Sr2 \/ Sref2 was compared with the \nF1-\u03b1 obtained from the Snedecor tables \nfor \u03b1=0.05 (P=95%). As can be \nobserved in Table 2, Fobs<F1-\u03b1 , so the \nrepeatabilities of the FI and reference \nmethod are similar. \n \nReproducibility (R) \nTable 2 shows the R values obtained \nand the results of the application of the \nSnedecor test: the reproducibility of the \nFI method is within the accepted range \nand similar to that of the reference \nmethod. \n  \nDetection (LOD) and quantification \n(LQ) limits \nTable 2 shows that the best LOD \ncorresponds to the FI method for \nethanol measurements and both the \nreference and the FI method give \nsimilar values for acetic acid. Similar \nbehaviour showed the quantification \nlimits, that is, best LQ for the FI \nmethod for ethanol and similar LQs for \nacetic acid in both the official and FI \nmethods.  \nAnalyst, 2001, Vol. 126, 1177-1181   \n \n \n 9\nTraceability \nThe traceability of the method was \nstudied by comparing the results \nobtained from 30 samples of different \nvinegars previously analysed by the \nreference method. Fig. 4 shows the \nregression of the flow injection method \nfor acetic acid versus the reference \nmethod. The regression equation, y= \n0,9436 x + 0,1142 (r2= 0,9947) shows a \ngood correlation between the two \nmethods. The correlation between the \nflow injection method and the reference \nmethod, in the case of ethanol, is also \ngood and the regression equation is y= \n1,0358 x \u20130,0139 (r2= 0,9930). Data \ndispersion is only observed for values \nupper to 8% (v\/v), which yields errors \nestimated in \u00b10,7% (v\/v) (see Fig. 5). \nThe confidence limits are shown in \nthe figures in dotted lines. In both cases \ntraceability was assured using the t-test.  \n \nSample throughput \nThe results in Table 2 show that the FI \nmethod is the fastest for the individual \ndeterminations as compared with each \nthe reference methods. The  proposed \nsequential method (seven determina-\ntions per hour) cannot be compared \nwith an official sequential counterpart \nbecause of the lack of the latter.  \n \n \n \nTable 2.

The method is simple, in-\nexpensive, presents a good correlation \nwith the official methods for these \nanalytes and can be easily implemented \nin a cellar for monitoring acetic fermen-\ntation process. The use of pervaporation \ninstead of gas diffusion offers the \nadvantage of non sample-membrane \ncontact, thus avoiding clogging and \ndeterioration of the membrane.  \nOther advantages of the method \nreported here are both a sampling \nthroughput higher than that of the \nmethods which include a distillation \nstep for separation of ethanol and \nabsence of sample pretreatment.  \nThis method constitutes a unique \nsequential application of flow injection \nfor determinations in vinegar and offers \nthe evident advantage of determining \nReference method\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nFl\now\n in\nje\nct\nio\nn \nm\net\nho\nd\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\ny= 0,9436 x + 0,1142;    r2= 0,9947\nOfficial method\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nFl\now\n in\nje\nct\nio\nn \nm\net\nho\nd\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\ny= 1,0358 x - 0,0139; r2= 0,9930\nAnalyst, 2001, Vol. 126, 1177-1181   \n \n \n 11\ntwo parameters using the same \nmanifold, thus reducing time and costs. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial \nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is \nthanked for financial support (Project \nBQM 2000\/ 0241).  \n \nReferences \n \n(1) FAO\/WHO, Comission of the \nCodex Alimentarius, 16\u00aa Sesi\u00f3n. \nGinebra, 1985 \n(2) Regulation (EEC) 822\/87, from \nthe European Council, 16th \nMarch, 1987. \n(3) Official Spanish Government \nBulletin, Royal decree 2070\/1993, \nB.O.E. n\u00ba 293 \n(4) Recueil des m\u00e9thodes Inter-\nnationales d\u00b4Analyse des Vins et \ndes Mouts, Office International de \nla vigne et du vin, O.I.V., Paris , \nFrance,1990. \n(5) A.O.A.C., Official Methods of \nAnalysis, 11\u00aa Ed., p. 520, n\u00ba \n30.068.,1970. \n(6) M.D. Capelato, A.
