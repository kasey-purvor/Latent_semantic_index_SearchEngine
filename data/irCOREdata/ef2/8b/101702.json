First it proposes a new method, \u201cvirtual curating\u201d, \nwhich is an extension to methods (such as content analysis and discourse analysis) deployed to \ninterrogate written texts. In this case the texts are works of art and virtual curating elaborates and \nevaluates a method for using these works to understand tourism. Second it mounts a virtual \nexhibition in tourism art distilled from the collection of around nine hundred works. It organizes \nthe art into themes, or galleries, and offers a guide to the exhibition. The outcomes of the article \nare a novel reading of, and fresh insights into both the phenomenon of tourism and its \nrepresentation. Keywords: virtual curating, art, representation, gaze. \nINTRODUCTION \nFor this unconventional paper some special forbearance, patience and effort is asked of its \nreader. Neither copyright laws nor space allow for the reproduction of the art work referred to. \nIdeally readers will visit these on the internet and this is easiest if the electronic version of the \njournal is being used together with an internet connection where clicking (control plus left click) \non the hyperlink will access the artwork. At a future date some of the weblinks may be dead but \nsubmitting the title to a Google image search should locate missing works. For those without \ninternet access a brief description of each artwork is given. It may be argued that such difficulties \npoint to the unsuitability of this piece as a journal article. However journals no longer need to be \ntotally text bound and technological innovations offer a ripe opportunity for multimedia \nexperimentation and cutting edge research should challenge the status quo.  \n \nThe rationale for this article is threefold. First whilst there has been attention in the literature to \nthe consumption of art by tourists (Graburn 1976) (e.g. in cultural tourism), the presentation of \ndestinations in art (e.g. in destination marketing), ethnic art for tourists (Cohen 1993) and visual \nculture (Crouch and Lubbren 2003), little attention has been given to tourism as a subject for \nartists. Second, commentators have pointed to some narrowness in our understanding and \nrepresentation of tourism (Tribe 2006). Third, as Rimmon-Kenan (1996:8) explains, \u201cgrave \n 2 \ndoubts have been cast on the capacity of language to reach\u2014let alone represent\u2014the world.\u201d It \nis in response to these issues that this article presents the Art of Tourism with a view free of the \nbinders and blinders that can restrict the gaze of academic researchers. The aims of the article are \nto provide a thick artistic description (Geertz 1973) and novel reading of the phenomenon of \ntourism with fresh insights into issues of its representation. \n \nThe article initially elaborates a novel method called \u201cvirtual curating\u201d. It then presents \u201cThe \nExhibition\u201d which displays a collection of carefully grouped and juxtaposed art works with \nexplanations and interpretations. It explores emerging themes of interest which include inter alia \nidealization, motivation, gender, experience, gaze, surveillance, representation, truth, \nsituatedness and memory. It builds upon ideas that emerge from the existing literature (Lippard \n1999; Dahlgren, Foreman and Van Eck 2005) with particular reference to de Botton (2003). \nTHE ART OF TOURISM \nThis section defends the use of art in a social sciences journal and its method of virtual curating. \nObjections may be raised that the art of tourism does not qualify for a social science journal. \nThere are three answers to this point. First art here is used as a text to be interrogated like other \ntexts and there are many examples in the social sciences and some in tourism social science of \nthe examination of texts (Hannam and Knox 2005). Second art adds to our interpretative \nunderstanding of the world of tourism and follows a movement that is becoming more common \nin the social sciences. Third this article encourages reflection on the limitations of simple text in \nsocial sciences. Another possible objection is that the method is not sufficiently robust. Sceptics \nholding this view are referred to Lincoln and Denzin (2003) for initiation into the expanding \nhorizons of methods. As they say: \u201cThe methodological revolution unties old knots concerning \nunderstandings and acceptable strategies for describing and representing the social world\u201d \n(2003:239). The method is indeed a novel one but researchers such as Mead and Bateson (2003) \nand Peterson Royce (2003) have described innovative methods of research using photography \nand poetry. \n 3 \nStudy Type and Method \nThe method here is \u201cvirtual curating\u201d. The researcher assumes the role of an art museum curator \nand the output is a display of works organized into viewing galleries supported by an exhibition \nguide. The article thereby extends the interpretivist tradition of research by offering a new, fresh \nand different account of tourism. The collection and analysis of data (works) proceeded as \nfollows. There were four lines of data collection. First a Google image search was used to mine \ndata. For five years a prolonged iterative and often serendipitous search for art was undertaken. \nSecond as new art collections were discovered these were cyber-visited and the researcher \nbrowsed the collections at length. A special effort was made to discover ethnic and indigenous \nart outside of the Anglo-Saxon cultural tradition. Third the author physically visited many \ngalleries. Fourth the discovery of an exhibition Universal Experience: Art, Life and the Tourist\u2019s \nEye at the Haywood Gallery, London added a rich new seam of data. Some limitations to this \napproach are conceded. There are inevitably pictures that defy discovery from simplistic search \nterms. Artists are often enigmatic in their choice of titles. However the collection phase resulted \nin the discovery of around nine hundred works and a database was set up to record each work, its \ntitle, the artist, the weblink and the date of production. \n \nData analysis commenced with a large unstructured collection of raw data (works). Where a \nquantitative researcher might turn to SPSS and a qualitative researcher turn to NVivo here the \nresearcher offers a personal ordering and reading of the pictures. The objective is to provide a \nnovel juaxtapositioning of the art, a plausible narrative and a connecting thread for the whole \nexhibition. The works were studied and a series of memos annotated and then sorted to produce a \nseries of over-arching themes. The desired end was to mimic, in a virtual space, a physical art \ngallery. The method brings a fusion of elements of grounded theory, content analysis and \nresearcher artistry. A number of different possible orderings were arrived at. For example it was \npossible to order the art in terms of movements (e.g. romanticism, surrealism, conceptualism \netc.) or concepts (authenticity, heritage, sustainability etc.). However it was decided to organize \nthe exhibition to mimic a journey, starting at home, traveling, and ending up back home with \nmemories. Inevitably a large number of works were discarded with a total of 82 chosen for the \nfinal exhibition. \n \n 4 \nIn quality terms there is no claim to researcher neutrality. The researcher\u2019s situatedness and \nembodiment both have significant effects on the particular gaze that is initially cast at the \nproblem and the way the data is analysed. Against this the wide repertoire of art, selected without \nany conscious bias, offers a form of value pluralism. No artist was ruled in or out and many \nperspectives are shown. Validity, reliability and falsifiability (Popper 1975) are not relevant here. \nIt is not possible to argue that this exhibition or guide is true or false. Many alternative \ncollections could be gathered, exhibitions mounted and explanations proffered. However it is \nclaimed that the results meet qualitative research standards of plausibility. They are also \nmeasured and qualified (in the sense that no over claiming is made, for example that this art \nrepresents all cultural perspectives) and the method is transparent (i.e. it is clearly set out so that \nthe reader may understand precisely what moves have been made and understand the subjective \nrole of the researcher). \nThe Exhibition \nThe exhibition is divided into galleries. Gallery 1: Gaze and Gauze, provides a different function \nfrom the other galleries. It offers a link between the methodology and the rest of the exhibition \nby raising questions about representation and how the world of tourism is seen by researchers \nand artists. The subsequent galleries are arranged around a journey starting and ending at home. \n \nGallery I: Gaze and Gauze. Magritte\u2019s The Treachery of Image (1929) \nhttp:\/\/www.artprintcollection.com\/images\/magritte_magritte_f4f745.jpg \nis a picture of a pipe including as part of itself the words \u201cthis is not a pipe\u201d and this paradox \nleads us immediately to the crux of this article. For a representation, whether text, picture, music \nor dance, generally falls someway short of what it seeks to represent. In semiotic terms there is a \ngap between the sign and the signified. A picture of the pipe misses many aspects of actual \npipeness for example texture, smell and chunkiness. After Magritte we may understand that \nresearch articles may miss some of the richness of the tourism phenomenon. It is an objective of \nthis article to provide greater richness by the intermingling of text and image. In Magritte\u2019s La \nCondition Humaine (1933) \nhttp:\/\/www.abcgallery.com\/M\/magritte\/magritte16.JPG \n 5 \nan easel holding an unframed painting of a landscape seems to offer an exact representation of \nthe view that it is blocking. A key issue raised is the extent to which art or research represents the \nworld that it seeks to describe. Of course art which is merely representational does not get under \nthe surface of tourism or offer any different view. But art can offer new insights and challenge \nthe taken for granted view. de Botton explains how \u201cartists [can] paint a portion of the world and \nin consequence open the eyes of others to it\u201d (2003:189). He cites artworks as provocative \ninstruments asking its audience for example to \u201clook at the sky of Provence, redraw your notion \nof wheat, do justice to olive trees\u201d (2003:189) \n \nTo illustrate this he offers a commentary on Van Gogh\u2019s Cypresses (1889) \nhttp:\/\/www.metmuseum.org\/explore\/gw\/art_gw\/el_tut_gogh_big.jpg \nexplaining that the flame-like turbulence that the artist saw in them demonstrates the sometimes \noverlooked structural characteristics of cypresses in Provence. According to de Botton, Van \nGogh highlights \u201ctheir beauty of line and proportion as an Egyptian obelisk \u2026 interesting black \nnotes \u2026the way they move in the wind\u201d (2003:194). Van Gogh\u2019s impressionist approach to \nrepresentation deliberately distorts in order to draw attention to particular aspects of the world. \nBut art is more than just opening our eyes and the title of this gallery, gaze and gauze, illustrates \ntwo ideas that can condition the way we see and represent the world. Researchers are generally \nunable to approach tourism research with a free gaze (Foucault 1980; Urry 2002) because of \ntheir embodied selves and situatedness (Tribe 2006). Magritte\u2019s The False Mirror (1928) \nhttp:\/\/www.new-york-art.com\/False-Mirror.jpg  \nillustrates this, challenging the general view of the eye as an instrument of clarity and truth \nthrough its provocative title. The superimposing of clouds floating across the eye invites \nquestioning of its clarity of vision. It speaks of clouded vision. The gaze may be clouded by \ncultural conditioning, gender, age, ethnicity and ideological influences amongst other things. In \nother words a gauze may distort the gaze. \n \nThe idea of gauze suggests a filter that mediates between the subject, the researched world of \ntourism and the representation of that world. Factors that influence our initial gaze into the world \nalso conspire to influence our subsequent representation of it. This is demonstrated in the work \nof Oppenheim - Reading Position for a Second Degree Burn (1970) \n 6 \nhttp:\/\/accad.osu.edu\/~ayoungs\/260\/jpgs\/vito_acconci.jpg \nwhich shows the imprint cast by the shadow of a book on the body of a sunbather. This \nillustrates how researchers come to embody the different traditions and disciplines that inform \ntheir intellectual position. Disciplines metaphorically leave their mark on us and inevitably create \nrecipes for the way in which researchers represent tourism. Magritte\u2019s Transfer (1966) \nhttp:\/\/www.staff.vu.edu.au\/sokolov\/Library\/Art\/Rene%20Magritte\/Transfer%201966.jpg \ndemands that we consider the role of the person - the artist or the researcher - who interposes \nthemselves between the phenomenal world and our view of it. It is a view of the sea. On the left \nside of the canvas a person blocks our view. On the right side the silhouette of the same person is \ncut into a curtain thus revealing the otherwise covered view of the sea. The silhouette cut-out \nperhaps tells us that our view is framed by the interposed person - the artist, the researcher - who \nlimits what we can see. It is this limited view, this partial framing, that artists often invite us to \nbreak through. This emphasizes an important mission of this paper, for a key aim of art is to \nliberate the acquired gaze, to lift the constructed gauze and to seek doggedly different ways of \n(re)presenting the world.  \n \nWith this in mind the final image in this gallery is from Bunuel\u2019s film Un Chien Andalou. \n(1929).  \nhttp:\/\/www.deutsches-filminstitut.de\/caligari\/dp2fc4849_01.jpg \nA woman\u2019s eye is slit with a razor blade and thereby the regularised gaze is violated. This \nrepresents a symbolic departure from the strictures of traditions, paradigms and disciplines and \nthe entering of the undisciplined world of art where an eclectic collection of works that \nencompass tourism themes will be considered. \n \nGallery II: Home and Away. Tourism has been viewed as a temporary offer of liberation. For \nexample Krippendorf (1984:25) considers that \u201cthe main motive for travel is the wish to escape\u201d. \nAnne Zahalka\u2019s photo-art offers a number of snapshots of people in their homes and Wednesday, \n8.40pm (1995) \nhttp:\/\/www.roslynoxley9.com.au\/artists\/3\/Anne_Zahalka\/239\/35231\/ \ncaptures the essence of ordinary life. It is viewed from behind a television that is being watched \nby two members of a family. Both look bored and weary. Through some doors another member \n 7 \nof the family sits at a table. It is a typical at home scene. It evokes notions of the surveillance of \neveryday life (Foucault 1980), alienation (Dann 1981) and anomie (Smith and Kelly 2006). \n \nA number of paintings by Hopper explore the notion of humans looking out (gazing at realms of \npossibilities) and feelings of longing. For example Morning Sun (1952) \nhttp:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/wm\/paint\/auth\/hopper\/interior\/hopper.morning-sun.jpg  \nshows a woman sitting on a bed looking out of a window. There is a sadness to her facial \nexpression and body language. The room seems austere and even prison-like and her gaze is \nfocused on the exterior pointing to an escape from the mundane, the predictable and the rules \n(Crompton 1979), emphasizing the dichotomies of inside \/ outside, here \/ there and home \/ away. \nhttp:\/\/www.scwca.org\/event\/images\/mvp\/08_saar.jpg \nEscape, freedom, constraint and repression reverberate through Saar\u2019s sculpture Coup (2006) \nwhere a woman sitting on a chair holds a pair of scissors. That which she could possibly cut is \nher hair which ties her to, and is entwined with, a pile of suitcases. \n \nStill at home another piece of photo art by Zahalka \u2013 The Gym (1998) \nhttp:\/\/www.roslynoxley9.com.au\/images\/galleries\/Zahalka_Leisureland\/021.jpg   \nreminds us that the idea of the perfect body on the perfect beach may cause us to recreate \nourselves in preparation (Frew and McGillivray 2005). Here is tourism (re)forming our identities \nand perhaps evidence of its (self)constructive power (Wearing and Wearing 2001). At the same \ntime art frames, markets and contributes to our pre-conceptions of places. Turner\u2019s Venice at \nSunrise from the Hotel Europa, with the Campanile of San Marco (circa 1840) \nhttp:\/\/www.artnet.com\/Magazine\/features\/karlins\/Images\/karlins12-8-3.jpg  \nis typical of many canvases that offer an a priori glimpse into Venice. It illustrates mechanical \nreproduction (MacCannell 1999) as an important driver of tourists towards their pre-seen sights. \nArt may shape our perception and direct our gaze when we finally experience the city.  \n \nGallery III: Crossings and Borders. Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s Poughkeepsie, New York (1937) \nhttp:\/\/www.metmuseum.org\/Works_of_Art\/images\/ph\/images\/1987.1100.48.L.jpg \nis an image of a railway station. It has two simple lines to it \u2013 a railway line disappearing into the \ndistance and the diagonal line of stairs leading to the platform. Both lines evoke a strong \n 8 \nanticipation of travel, of movement and of a trajectory into another place. A similarly strong \nevocation of a journey is found in Lange\u2019s  \nThe Road West (1938) \nhttp:\/\/www.metmuseum.org\/Works_of_Art\/images\/ph\/images\/ph1990.1005.L.jpg \nIts distant horizon seems to depict a journey as time consuming, as hard work and possibly long \narduous and monotonous. Contrast this with Hockney\u2019s Pearblossom Highway (1986) \nhttp:\/\/kancrn.kckps.k12.ks.us\/rosedale\/Hockney\/hockney.pearblossom-highway.jpg \nwhere the journey is colorful, an event in itself and scenic. The road approaches a crossroads \noffering choice. The road can be seen as a triumph over nature, offering a route to freedom \n(Obenour 2005). Following the motif of the road, McGingley\u2019s Falling Forward Pochron \n(undated) evokes a strong sensation of speed and fresh air as the wind blows through the hair of a \nwoman being driven in the back of an open truck. \nhttp:\/\/www.linternaute.com\/sortir\/sorties\/exposition\/arles\/diaporama\/images\/11.jpg \n \nWallinger\u2019s video installation Threshold to the Kingdom (2000)  \nwww.exibart.com\/foto\/34419.jpg \nfocuses on arrival. It shows, in slow motion, passenger arrivals at an airport accompanied by the \nsoundtrack of Allegri's Miserere. It celebrates the frontiers of liminality (Ryan 2004) and spaces \nwith the possibilities of different rules. The faces of passengers sometimes express expectation, \nsometimes bewilderment. This act of passage offers the possibility to abandon regular cultural \nbaggage and explore new places, self and others. Of course tourism is predicated on free \nmovement and World Airport was the name of the installation by Hirschhorn at the 1999 Venice \nBiennale. \nhttp:\/\/www.renaissancesociety.org\/site\/files\/media\/478\/2000_hirschhorn_flugplatzwelt1_n.jpg \nHere a whole gallery was filled with artefacts of air travel. Planes of different flag carriers and \ncontrol towers are interconnected with criss-crossed ribbons signifying global reach and highly \nnetworked (Larsen, Urry and Axhausen 2007) systems of communication. At the same time \nshabby neon lights signal the airport\u2019s transition from an extraordinary place to one which now \ncharacterises the ordinariness of a launderette. \n \n 9 \nAlong with planes, the passport is the key to mobility for tourists and Babin\u2019s Run Away Turn \nAway (2005) \nhttp:\/\/static.flickr.com\/24\/59782696_2b05727d1a_o.jpg \npresents the passport as an open winding road of possibilities of travel. Indeed tourists take for \ngranted the effortless crossing of borders (Frendberg 2006). But the concept of mobilities also \nhails its counterpart \u2013 that of immobility (Hannam, Sheller, and Urry 2006) which is the fact of \nlife for many excluded from the privileges of tourism. Both the title and the content of Udemba\u2019s \nWorld White Walls point up the selective basis upon which mobility is granted. Travelers are \nsegregated into lines based on nationality. \nhttp:\/\/benjiart.free.fr\/emekaudemba\/\/uploaded_images\/wwwa-718165.jpg \nIndeed, those who are deselected from mobility have their passports marked \u2013 as illustrated by \nUdemba\u2019s Refused. \nhttp:\/\/www.ifa.de\/galerien\/visa\/pics\/udemba2.jpg \nThey thus become unable to pass ports and other gateways and form a huge population of \nimmobile persons. Richter\u2019s Bass (2002) \nhttp:\/\/www.cfa-berlin.com\/image_base\/work\/dr\/m\/M\/dr_m_138_00.jpg \nshows a group of the refused huddled together on small raft in a dark sea trying to circumvent the \nairports and ports that for them create barriers to mobility and a better life. Similarly the Serbian \nartist Ostojic conjures up alternative and desperate routes whereby the non-privileged can \nachieve mobility in Looking for a Husband With E.U. Passport (2000). Her performance art \nconsisted of soliciting applications for EU passport holders to provide her with marriage and \nthereby mobility in Europe. \nhttp:\/\/www.paris-art.com\/photos\/No-Ostojic-12G.jpg \nThe minimalist artist, Gonzales-Torres presents a piece called \"Untitled\" (Passport) (1991). This \nis a stack of white paper. The blankness of the papers represents the antithesis of the ornate \nbureaucratic patterning, identity marking, visas and transit stamps of a passport. Gonzalez-Torres \nexpresses his \u201coutrage at a social system that marginalizes \"others\" such as homosexuals, the \neconomically disenfranchised, and foreigners\u2014in much of his work \u2026[Passport] suggests a \nworld without arbitrary borders and assigned nationalities, offering dreams of unfettered space \nand boundless travel.\u201d (Guggenheim 2007) \nhttp:\/\/www.guggenheim.org\/exhibitions\/singular_forms\/images\/artworks\/image_13a.jpg \n 10 \n \nGallery IV: Pleasure and Flow.  \nIn this gallery art fills an absence noted by Crouch and Desforges (2003:5-6) of \u201caspects of \npleasure, fun and sensuality which tourism encompasses at a common sense level but which have \noften been excluded from academic theorizing\u201d. \nhttp:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/liverpool\/culture\/2003\/01\/openeye_butlins\/openeye\/storymain.jpg \nHinde\u2019s (1960s) postcard of the front of a Butlins holiday camp shows a purple neon sign on the \nfront of a building proclaiming \u201cOur true intent is all for your delight\u201d. Holiday camps were \ndedicated to pleasure and promoting \u201cplay as a free activity standing consciously outside \n\u201cordinary\u201d life (Huizinger 1955:13). \nhttp:\/\/image.guardian.co.uk\/sys-images\/Guardian\/Pix\/gallery\/2001\/12\/04\/Hanson1.jpg \nHanson is renowned for his hyper-real works and in Tourists (1970) he presents two tourists in a \nstate of mild enjoyment, highlighting some of the attributes of their pleasures. They are clearly \ngazing at a tourist site or spectacle hence drawing attention to the centrality of sightseeing in \ntourism. They are equipped to capture experience through photography and souvenirs and they \nare dressed in a kind of leisure uniform of relaxed, informal clothing. \n \nArtists captured the more sensuous aspects of tourism somewhat before Veijola and Jokinen \n(1994) led research into sensual engagement and embodied encounters. For example Picasso\u2019s \nLe Moulin de la Galette (1900)  \nhttp:\/\/www.guggenheimcollection.org\/images\/lists\/work\/126_15_lg.jpg \ndepicts a scene of intense hedonism of Parisian night life in a dark club with drinks, dancing and \na strong sense of bodily contact and sexual ritual. Matisse\u2019s Le bonheur de vivre (1906)  \nhttp:\/\/www.artnet.com\/magazine\/features\/saltz\/Images\/saltz2-19-9.jpg \ninvokes hedonism in a rural setting. Here strong colors and naked bodies display an absence of \ninhibiting baggage with scenes of dancing, playing music and love-making in carefree enjoyment \nand celebration of nature. It is the body, rather than the gaze that is emphasised here. More \nrecently Cook\u2019s The Bathing Pool  \nhttp:\/\/www.alexander-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/works_art\/The%20Bathing%20Pool.jpg \ntypifies her work characterized by the use of big, bold caricatured figures, strong, bright colors \nand an atmosphere of simple fun and enjoyment. Cook\u2019s work is also notable in celebrating not \n 11 \njust the perfect body, but rather a range of body types and ages. It challenges the marginalization \nof the non-perfect body where \u201cFoucauldian self-surveillance can inhabit the everyday \ngeographies of fat bodies\u201d and the beach can be \u201ca place of embarrassment, self consciousness \nand even self concealment\u201d (Bell and Valentine 1997:36). Meanwhile, Ardizzone\u2019s Lovers by the \nSea (1960) \nhttp:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/collection\/P\/P06\/P06011_9.jpg \noffers a romantic view of flow between persons, lost in love, set off against a coastal backdrop.  \n \nCsikszentmihalyi\u2019s (1990) concept of flow adverts to a condition of complete centring of \nattention, loss of self-consciousness and total immersion. Cary (2004) analyses a similar state \nwhich she terms the tourist moment and Wang (1999) conceptualizes existential authenticity as \ntourists losing themselves. Picasso seems particularly able to express flow. For example Deux \nFemmes Courant sur la Plage (La Course) (1922) shows two women dancing in a simple, \nsensual celebration of life, the sea and the air. Their hair flows behind them, their clothes fall \naway as they achieve a state of joy and pure being in nature.  \nhttp:\/\/artchive.com\/artchive\/p\/picasso\/picasso_running.jpg \nSimilarly by portraying the body in a cubist style in Baigneuse (1928) Picasso liberates it from \nits usual material form and restrictions enabling it to achieve a freedom of expression and \nmovement and reveals a different configuration of its parts that challenges the viewer to see the \nbody in a new way. \nhttp:\/\/www.balnea.net\/images\/gallerie\/1123_1.jpg \nMagritte\u2019s The Bather (1925) \nhttp:\/\/www.tereks.com\/images\/Magritte\/9723.jpg \nbrings a sense of calm, relaxation and of being and belonging. A woman is painted with a \nlightness of being in a stylish room that looks out onto an inviting beach scene. The outline of \nthe woman\u2019s body is echoed and mirrored in the lines of the shore. There is a strong sense of \nresonance, fit and fluidity between person and place. \nhttp:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/christoph_schmidberger_untitled.htm \nSchmidberger\u2019s (2005) work, I am Open for Everything, Don't Get me Wrong, suggests a \npushing of pleasure to the limits, an openness to possibilities and the throwing off of constraint. \n 12 \nA young man in a swimming costume and an elaborate restoration style wig lies on his front at \nthe edge of a swimming pool. His body is rendered sensual by glowing sunlight. \n \nGallery V: Alienation and Rupture. Tourism also brings moments of disjunction, feelings of un-\nconnectedness and sadness. In her photograph Self-Portrait on the Train, Germany (1992) \nhttp:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/collection\/P\/P78\/P78047_9.jpg \nGoldin gazes out of a train window with a blank expression. The motivation for the shot was her \nrealization that when she looks at a landscape she often sees it almost as a postcard and finds it \nhard to connect with what she is looking at. These feelings of alienation from place, of distance, \nof failure to emotionally connect with the environment, perhaps caused by the impenetrability of \nnew places, or the overwhelming power or size of nature are also expressed in Illingworth\u2019s \nTawera (2000) \nhttp:\/\/www.ferner.co.nz\/assets\/resized\/img\/CatalogueAnniversary\/Illingworth,Michael32461-0-\n350-0-300.jpg  \nHere the subject of the picture is boxed in and isolated from the surrounding nature and separate \nfrom and unable to touch the natural world. Beckmann paints the subject of his canvas, Hotel \nLobby (1950)  \nhttp:\/\/www.katz-\nheidelberg.de\/Themen_im_Unterricht\/Expressionismus\/Beckmann_HotelLobby.jpg \ninto a similar state of isolation. There is no physical barrier in this painting of a crowded tableau \nof people in a hotel lobby. Yet each person presents dark facial expressions and the body \nlanguage of emotional isolation. There is a lack of human contact despite the close proximity of \nhumans and the paradox of aloneness in a typical busy holiday space. \n \nde Botton (2003:20) identifies an irritant in The Art of Travel where he finds it difficult to move \ninto his liminal space. He takes off for Barbados where he discovers the: \nmomentous but until then overlooked fact\u2026that I had \ninadvertently brought myself with me to this island \u2026 My body \nand mind were to prove temperamental accomplices in the mission \nof appreciating my destination. The body found it hard to sleep ... \n 13 \nThe mind meanwhile revealed a commitment of anxiety, boredom, \nfree-floating sadness and financial alarm. \nThis reading of self-consciousness on holiday is neatly captured by Moore\u2019s painting Feet on \nHoliday II (date unknown) \nhttp:\/\/www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk\/images\/cgm_562_1.jpg \nHere, the sea, the landscape and the whole holiday place are partially obscured by a pair of feet \nwhich thereby bring into the image a self-consciousness of the body by the subject. \n \nIn his later study, Tourist II (1988) \nhttp:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/duane_hanson_tourists_2.htm \nHanson makes tourism seem like a chore and Lewis (1997:6) describes the piece as follows: \nAn American couple kitted out in the garish colours of their \nsummer clothes gaze upwards to an exhibit, their faces belying no \nemotion other than boredom. To this extent they are like many \ntourists, force feeding themselves with culture for which they have \nno genuine interest but which they will enjoy talking about in \nretrospect in the comfort of their own home while passing the \nphotos around. \n \nEmin\u2019s Sad Shower in New York (1995)  \nhttp:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/collection\/P\/P11\/P11567_9.jpg  \noffers a poignant autobiographical canvas revealing the loneliness and sadness she has \nexperienced whilst visiting foreign cities. It is a simple line figure under a miserably dripping \nshower. It is stripped of the visual brochure hyperbole that markets destinations and hotels to \nleave a solitary, vulnerable, forlorn figure. The UK graffiti artist, Banksy, brings a chilling \nperspective to urban tourism. Tourist Information (2005) was sprayed on a wall in Hackney, an \narea of social deprivation in London. Whilst cities are routinely sanitized and romanticized in the \nliterature distributed by Tourist Information Centres, Banksy gives a more edgy view of this area \nsuggesting that tourists might come up against \u201choodies\u201d and that their safety might be at risk. \nhttp:\/\/www.artofthestate.co.uk\/photos\/banksy_tourist_information.jpg \n \n 14 \nTwo works highlight the ruptures generated by the architecture of tourism. Whilst much \nacademic research has been undertaken on impacts, little work exists on the aesthetics of \ntourism\u2019s built environment (Chaspoul 1997).  \nhttp:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/doig_Concrete_Cabin.htm \nDoig\u2019s Concrete Cabin (1994) offers an upsetting juxtaposition of a minimalist Le Corbusier \nmonolithic building of sharp bright modernist angles which comes up against and inevitably \noverpowers (and replaces) the soft, natural shapes and colors of a surrounding pine forest. \nTourism has transformed the landscape that it wished to appreciate. \nhttp:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/florian_maier_aichen_220.htm \nMaier-Aichen\u2019s Untitled (2005) offers a dissonant view that contrasts with the typical postcard \npicture of seaside and coast. The broad blue sweep of the ocean crashes against a long sandy \nbeach rendering the left part of the picture one of nature in harmony but the landscape on the \nright side is tinted red. This draws attention to its growing unnatural state, the scaring presence of \na super highway and the encroaching development of real estate evoking an alienating scene. \n \nGallery VI: Hosts and Guests. Many artists working with tourism themes operate within a \nWestern tradition. This can mean that the tourism world is seen through a particular gaze; hence \nit is important to locate native artists who can reveal host accounts. The Samoan artist Tibbo\u2019s \nUntitled (1968) \nhttp:\/\/www.art-newzealand.com\/Issue105\/tibbo2.jpg \noffers such a view. A river mouth scene with dugout canoes, straw-roofed huts, and native \npeople fishing is painted with na\u00efve directness. It is a scene of simplicity depicting a natural life \ndevoid of industrialization or advanced economic development. The water and sky take up much \nof the canvas. Astiti is an Indonesian artist. In her work Women of Two Continents (1993) \nhttp:\/\/www.aev.vic.edu.au\/online_resources\/crossing_boundaries\/women_ot_two_continents.jpg \nshe offers a juxtaposition of women in native dress and tourists, dressed in short \nskirts and bikinis, photographing the native women. Astiti raises issues adverted \nto by Smith (1989) on host-guest relations and evokes thoughts about the ethical \nand appropriate behaviour. Indeed it may lead us to ask whether the local women \nare offering a particular performance for the satisfaction of the tourists. \n \n 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.andrewsmithgallery.com\/images\/zig\/ZIG1086.jpg \nJackson is a native American Indian. In his picture Indian Photographing Tourist Photographing \nIndian (1991) he turns the tables on, and thereby holds up for scrutiny, the usual \u201cguest takes \nphoto of host\u201d situation and turns it into \u201chost (himself) takes photo of guest (a white woman) \ntaking photo of hosts (two Indians)\u201d. By doing this he reclaims the power that is usually lost to \nthe guest in such a situation and invokes what Maoz (2006) terms a more mutual gaze. Guest - \nhost relations also feature in the art of Loustal. Touriste de Banana (1998) depicts a tourist with a \nsuitcase who turns his back on a local woman. It looks like the end of a holiday affair. A boat \nsymbolizes the tourist\u2019s mobility whilst the woman appears sad and wistful. \n http:\/\/www.loustal.nl\/_borders\/franst2.gif \n \nFusco and Gomez-Pe\u00f1a\u2019s performance art (1992-1994) was titled Undiscovered Amerindians \nand explores the various scriptings of host - guest relations. \nwww.english.emory.edu\/ Bahri\/Fusco.html.  \nThey placed themselves in a cage, dressed in unusual costumes (of the fictitious Guatinaui \npeople) and engaged in bizarre rituals offering themselves as the cultural \u201cother\u201d. Fusco \n(1995:47) commented on how: \nOur cage became a blank screen onto which audiences projected \ntheir fantasies of who and what we are. As we assumed the \nstereotypical role of the domesticated savage, many audience \nmembers felt entitled to assume the role of colonizer, only to find \nthemselves uncomfortable with the implications of the game. \nhttp:\/\/www.re-title.com\/public\/artists\/2213\/1\/julesde-balincourt-1.jpg \nde Balincourt\u2019s People Who Play and the People Who Pay (2004) depicts a hotel scene with \nswimming pool and palm trees. The guests are sunbathing, swimming and drinking and are \npredominantly white. A more careful inspection reveals a cadre of black workers doing \nhousekeeping jobs in the rooms or providing service on the terrace. \nGallery VII: Gender and Space. In Hopper\u2019s Hotel Room (1931) \nhttp:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/wm\/paint\/auth\/hopper\/interior\/hopper.hotel-room.jpg \na woman sits on a bed in a hotel room reading a book raising many questions about gender and \ntourism. Is this woman excluded from tourism spaces by her gender? Are liminal spaces mainly \n 16 \nfor men? Jordan and Gibson\u2019s (2005) research into solo women tourists discusses their \nexperiences in terms of surveillance, resistance and empowerment prompting the question \nwhether the woman in Hopper\u2019s picture is seeking refuge from the aggressive male gaze. \nCertainly Orkin\u2019s American Girl in Italy (1995) underlines the position of the lone female tourist \nwho is harassed by the explicitly performed male gaze. \nhttp:\/\/imagesource.art.com\/images\/-\/Ruth-Orkin\/American-Girl-in-Italy-1951-Print-\nC10313527.jpeg \nIt captures the cultural shock of a female American tourist in Italy in the 1950s where the \nintensity of the gaze makes walking down the street a visibly difficult experience. \n \nhttp:\/\/www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\/artists\/artpages\/sasnal_Resort.htm \nSasnal\u2019s Resort 1999 offers a critical counterpart to the paradise in the top half of the painting of \na virgin coast line. The bottom half shows a white women half sitting, half lying on a bed, served \nby a black waiter. Whilst drawing attention to the asymmetries between the server and the served \nthere is also some ambivalence suggested in the proximity of the pair and the woman\u2019s pose. \nThis might be an example of \u201creverse gender relations \u2026 based on the idea of structurally \nunequal power relations between tourist generating and tourist receiving countries\u201d (Dahles \n2002:181), or \u201csex, tourism, and changing gender identities\u201d (Dahles 2002:180). \n \nAitchison and Reeves (1998) discuss gendered (bed)spaces and analyze the gendered \nconsumption of places and the reinforcement and resistance of gendered identities in tourism. \nThey investigate women only spaces as sites of resistance and Cezanne\u2019s Five Bathers (1885) \ncaptures the spirit of such spaces with a depiction of five women, naked, seemingly in harmony \nwith one another, and with nature, in the absence of a male gaze. This painting has a very \ndifferent emotional texture to that of Hopper. It is one of confidence. \nhttp:\/\/klp.pl\/admin-malarstwo\/images\/grafiki\/1630.jpg \nSimilarly, Cook\u2019s Cruising (undated) \nhttp:\/\/www.berylcook.org\/store\/Admin\/Displayimage.aspx?productid=176 \nmarks out a women\u2019s space as a place of celebration. In this brightly coloured painting five \nwomen in bathing costumes drink champagne in a Jacuzzi on a cruise ship. This is a picture of \n 17 \nempowered female tourists. The males in the picture despite their uniforms of power are smaller \nfigures and walking out of the scene. Any potential male gaze has been resisted. \nhttp:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/servlet\/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=26389&searchid=879\n0&tabview=image \nIn contrast to the strong female subjects of Cook, Shine On (Lucas 1991) shows objectified \nfemale bodies using a double page spread from a British popular newspaper The Sport. A semi \ntopless model suggestively eats an ice cream amongst other images of the British working class \nseaside during a heat wave. By taking these two pages out of the context of this popular \nnewspaper and (re)presenting them as a piece of art, Lucas draws attention to the representation \nof, and attitudes to, the female body which are legitimised and reproduced through the popular \npress.  \n \nGallery VIII: Power and Politics. In this gallery political art is presented. It begins by recalling \nNash\u2019s (1989) comments on tourism as a form of imperialism and the painting by Catlin - La \nSalle Erecting a Cross and Taking Possession of the Land. March 25, 1682 (1847) - provides a \nprovocative metaphor to illustrate this. It shows the unequal power relations between host and \n\u201cincoming guest\u201d (the latter with weapons) and planting of a cultural symbol (the cross) as the \nimperialist power subjugates an economically and technologically weaker host community and \ntakes ownership of land. \nhttp:\/\/www.nga.gov\/cgi-bin\/pimage?50361+0+0 \n \nClashes of civilizations (Huntington 1996) and ideologies are the stuff of artists Arzamasova, \nEvzovitch and Svyatsky (AES) who pose a provocative challenge to established, iconic symbols \nof heritage and nation in New Freedom (2006). This alters an image of the Statue of Liberty to \nwear the veil and carry a copy of the Qur\u2019an and effectively foregrounds ideology and hegemony \nat work in and through tourism. For whilst the original statue proclaims liberty, New Freedom \nquestions whether liberty is confined to a taken for granted Washington Consensus and to what \nextent is it able to embrace competing world-views such as Muslim fundamentalism? \nhttp:\/\/www.islamonline.net\/English\/artculture\/2003\/04\/images\/pic04.jpg \nNew Freedom was part of a traveling art installation called AES Travel Agency to the Future. \nThis was a fake travel agency where the audience could interact with images and artefacts of \n 18 \nfamiliar destinations (posters, postcards, mugs, carpets and T-shirts) that had been overlaid with \nIslamic visual references. \nhttp:\/\/www.aes-group.org\/img\/tattf\/10b.jpg \nIn this way the familiar tourist gaze was disrupted and forced to engage with issues of identity, \nfear, difference, cultural representation and the possibility of a radically different new world \norder. This is particularly evident in Arzamasova, Evzovitch and Svyatsky\u2019s Travel Agency to \nthe Future: Central Park (1996) where domes and minarets are placed into the New York \nskyline and what appears to be a Bedouin caravan makes its way across Central Park.  \nhttp:\/\/www.aes-group.org\/img\/ip\/05b.jpg \n \nAir travel has become a stage for the playing out of the geopolitics of resisting and opposing \nforces and Grimonprez\u2019s In Flight (1998) parodies aspects of plane hijacking using the medium \nof an In-Flight magazine containing subverted destination maps (pinpointing skyjacks), spoof \nadvice by the terrorist Leila Khaled on what to do with a stolen Boeing and satirized safety \ninstructions from SkyJack Air on how to survive a hijack. \nhttp:\/\/www.replica21.com\/archivo\/artistas\/unclass\/108_images\/108_grimonprez.jpg \nOn a more personal note Burden\u2019s 747 (1973) \nhttp:\/\/www.orbit.zkm.de\/files\/Burden747-1973.jpg \nwas a piece of performance art where he fired several pistol shots at a Boeing 747 taking off at \nLos Angeles. This portrays an individual frustrated at some aspect of air travel or what it \nrepresents. He demonstrates some empowerment through the deployment of a revolver against \nsuch a mighty machine, yet at the same time an impotence in that whilst a revolver might kill a \nhuman it would not ground a plane. \n \nMuch of the politics of tourism is played out over the contestation of representation of culture \nand heritage. A good example of this is Quinn\u2019s Alison Lapper Pregnant (2005) (plate 1). This \npolitical, tourism art interpellates a subject, a disabled, pregnant woman, that is regularly \noverlooked and treats it to a special representation in white marble, one of the finest materials of \nsculpture. It was placed in Trafalgar Square, London confronting and challenging a deeply \nestablished statue-discourse of famous military men and their battles.  \n \n 19 \n \nPlate 1: Photo of Quinn\u2019s Alison Lapper Pregnant in Trafalgar Square, London \nSource: The author \n \nThis challenging of the normalised discourse of heritage where women, the disabled and blacks \nare routinely suppressed from representation (Chambers 2003) is vigorously pursued in a project \nentitled RepoHistory which designed and displayed signs that challenged official markers by \noffering alternative readings of heritage. For example New York Slave Market by Timoney and \nO'Brien (1999) was used to mark the hitherto overlooked site of the New York Slave Market. \nhttp:\/\/www.repohistory.org\/images\/lower_manhattan_sign_project\/lmSlaveMarket.jpg \n \nGallery IX: Nostalgia and Novelty. \nhttp:\/\/architettura.supereva.com\/allestimenti\/20031029\/05_c.jpg \nTwo works by Diller and Scofidio open this gallery. Tourism Case Studies (1991) presented 50 \nidentical open suitcases hanging from the ceiling, suggesting uniformity, standardisation and the \nMacDonaldisation (Ritzer 1993) of packaged tourism. But each contains a critical case study of \n 20 \nan attraction in each US state using both official and unofficial data so that the expectant gaze \nmight be diverted in different directions according to the reading taken. \nhttp:\/\/www.arcspace.com\/architects\/DillerScofidio\/aberrant_architectures\/Photo-4.jpg \nInterclone Hotel (1997) is a fictional advert series for a hotel chain pointing up how global \nbrands tend to extinguish local difference. A basic corporate backdrop of a hotel room remains a \nconstant onto which peripheral stereotypical regional features may be dragged and dropped from \na limited palette. Attention is thereby drawn to the way the tourist bubble is extended through \nglobal hotel chains as familiar and predictable spaces are created within exotic places and any \nsense of overpowering otherness is neutered. \n \nIn contrast, Timtschenko\u2019s Venice II (1999)  \nhttp:\/\/www.artfacts.net\/exhibpics\/9874.jpg \nshows how the exotic (in this case Venetian gondolas, arches and canals) can be inserted by way \nof simulacra into largely void spaces. Paradoxically what can be recognized as the authentic Las \nVegas is thus composed of a series of inauthentic and impossibly juxtaposed sights. \nhttp:\/\/www.replica21.com\/archivo\/artistas\/c\/m_cattelan\/395_cattelan_5.jpg \nIn Hollywood (2001) Cattelan reproduces the iconic 23 metre high sign letters of Hollywood LA \nand relocates them to the hills of Sicily above the municipal dump near Palermo. This has \novertones of Magritte. Here is a site proclaiming to be Hollywood, yet clearly not being it \nconfronting us with ontological issues of tourism, the authentic and the real, and the tricks that \ncan be played with sites and markers. \n \nAuthenticity and conservation versus progress and modernization are ideas that are adverted to in \nInternal Renovations (2006) by de Balincourt. \nhttp:\/\/www.juliafeyrer.org\/kkimages\/JDB-InternalRenovations06_b.jpg \nHere a Bavarian mountain landscape scene is idealised and put into a museum showcase with \ninteractive buttons provided for the visitor. This piece offers a number of connotations. The area \nis somehow cut off from the rest of the world and change. It is delineated as a place for \npreservation and nostalgia. It becomes an objectified site of amusement for the outsider who is \nafforded play and power by the buttons. The place is ossified and displayed as a spectacle and \nthe glass sides of the case underline the inspecting gaze of the observer. \n 21 \n \nhttp:\/\/tripcart.typepad.com\/tripcart_the_blog\/images\/leonard_knight_139_by_guacamole_airline\ns.jpg \nThe creative artistic imagination is demonstrated in the final works of this gallery. First, \nSalvation Mountain (ongoing) is a physical creation by Knight. He continues to create a 30 metre \nwide outdoor installation near San Diego using recycled rubbish and donations of paint. It is \nbased around religious themes and although once threatened by removal by local authorities has \nnow become a significant attraction. \nhttp:\/\/www.hawaii.edu\/lruby\/art359\/IMAGES\/SPIRALJ.GIF \nIn the work Spiral Jetty (c 1970) Smithson altered the physical environment to create a huge \nspiral in the Great Salt Lake, Utah consisting of a path five meters wide projecting 400 meters \ninto the lake. It was made by moving 650 tons of earth and its inspiration apparently came from \nfeelings evoked in Smithson when he encountered this place. In these two pieces art creates a \ntourist attraction. \nhttp:\/\/www.efluxmail.com\/m_images\/1108039268mcanew.jpg \nCruise City City Cruise (2003) by nl-architects shows two aircraft carriers converted for leisure. \nThis could be simply architects experimenting with ideas to create new playgrounds or \naccommodations for tourists. It could be a solution for containing and limiting impacts. It might \nbe a prescient image of how global warming might affect tourism so that its current locations \nwhich would become untenable would have to be transported to more clement latitudes. It might \nshow a post-military utopia where machines of war had been converted to purposes of leisure \nand pleasure. \n \nGallery X: Nature and Nurture. Boyd\u2019s Riverbank (1971)  \nhttp:\/\/www.alfredhartemink.nl\/images\/Art\/Arthur%20Boyd%20Riverbank%20%201971.jpg  \noffers an uncomplicated view of nature untouched by development underpinned by rich colours \nof the earth, a cloudless blue sky, undisturbed, muddy waters and uncultivated vegetation. Nature \nin Magritte\u2019s Arnheim's Domain (1943) \nhttp:\/\/www.classifieds4u.co.uk\/surrealists\/Magritte\/Magritte-Arnheim'sdomain.jpg \nis a view of an imposing mountain covered in snow. The view is over a ledge upon which rests a \nbird\u2019s nest containing two eggs. The ridge of the mountain has transformed into an eagle\u2019s head \n 22 \nand wings so that the natural appears subverted into a spectacle and perhaps even a theme park. \nDoes this represent the Americanization of nature and a persistent desire to intervene and tame \nnature? Are the eggs of the eagle? If so they might be symbolic of reproduction, of globalising \ntendencies and the unstoppable march of development and threat to the wilderness. Or possibly \nthey are symbolic of fragility and our attention is turned in a different way to the vulnerability of \nthe natural world. \n \nHopper\u2019s Gas (1940) \nhttp:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/wm\/paint\/auth\/hopper\/street\/hopper.gas.jpg  \noffers a strange contradiction between the calm, welcoming aspect of a gas station highlighted by \nthe warmth of its lights in the gathering dusk and its stark industrial intrusion within deep nature. \nPerhaps we so take for granted the existence of gas stations and so depend upon them that their \nlocation does not upset us any more. Craxton\u2019s Hotel by the Sea (1946), \nhttp:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/collection\/T\/T00\/T00117_9.jpg \npainted on the Greek island of Poros, offers a benign view of development (a hotel) in harmony \nand scale amongst the landscape and nature. This is in strong contrast to \nhttp:\/\/www.kopenhagen.dk\/typo3temp\/pics\/d1e45b0fba.jpg \nRoepstorff\u2019s Hidden Truth (2002) and the somewhat apocalyptic scene offered in this last picture \nof this gallery. As the programme (Saatchi Gallery 2007) notes:  \nHidden Truth is a monument of kitsch: a billboard-sized postcard-\ncollage celebrating the mastery of tourism over an unconquerable \nsublime landscape. Envisioning an estate agent\u2019s dream of a rustic \nsci-fi paradise condo-ized for maximum investment, Roepstorff\u2019s \ndevelopment is ruthless and ridiculous. Tower blocks nestle in \nvirgin forests, impossibly balance in cliff faces, and teeter \nprecariously on insurmountable summits. Hovering over the scene \nis a fixed oracle of nirvana, exploding with the fairytale bijou of \nglobalisation, aligning the planets in a parody of capitalist bliss. \n \nGallery XI: Marks and Memories. Returning from travels invites interest in what we bring home. \nThis may include souvenirs (Morgan and Pritchard 2005), photos, memories (Small 1999), \n 23 \nexperiences, postcards, suntans and even other people. Zahalka reflects on photographs as \nsouvenirs in her work The Tourists (1990).  \nhttp:\/\/www.roslynoxley9.com.au\/images\/galleries\/Anne_Zahalka_BondiPlayground1994\/005.jpg \nDifferent groups are photographed against the same backdrop reminding us that photographs \ninvolve the framing of memories and may demonstrate selective realism and distortion of place. \nWe are prompted to ask whether tourists seek the replication of brochure images (Jenkins 2003) \nand if journeys can sometimes descend into a series of photostops. Zahalka also provides a series \nof postcard-inspired photographs of places (Thurlow, Jaworski and Yvonne-McEwen 2004), \nincluding Greetings from Lemlahak (1997) which features a woman in ethnic dress against a \nlandscape. \nhttp:\/\/www.zahalkaworld.com\/images\/Woven%20Threads\/Elma%20postcard%2072dpi.jpg \nCarruthers (1997) explains this was commissioned with a view to \u201cbreak with stereotypical \nrepresentations of the developing world\u201d and how Zahalka develops: \nher critique of postcard photography, a genre which ossifies and \ncommodifies cultural difference (more often than not the \ndifference of subaltern ethnic groups), turning it into a hollowed-\nout sign of colourful and unique national identity. \n \nMinick\u2019s Woman with Scarf at Inspiration Point (1980) \nhttp:\/\/www.tfaoi.com\/am\/14am\/14am108.jpg \noffers an illustration of mechanical reproduction (MacCannell 1999) and commodification \n(MacCannell 2001) in the sacrilization of sights. It also demonstrates how we often wish to wear \nour tourism as a signifier of social status. This is also achieved by the cultivation of the perfect \nsun tan as illustrated by Dupain\u2019s Sunbaker (1937). \nhttp:\/\/www.nga.gov.au\/federation\/Large\/102513.jpg \nThe headscarf as a memento also illustrates the circularity in tourism for when back home our \nappetite to travel again is often stirred by such visual markers.  \n \nPenney\u2019s Baggage Reclaim 'BA' (1999). \nhttp:\/\/fineart.ac.uk\/images\/works\/Ulst\/700\/ul0002_1.jpg.  \nreveals by X-ray what our baggage might contain and Hirst\u2019s Forms Without Life (1991) \n 24 \nhttp:\/\/www.tate.org.uk\/collection\/T\/T06\/T06657_9.jpg \nis a display cabinet containing polished seashells taken from Thailand. The shells offer a material \nreminder of the place from which they were brought but the critical fact emerges that their \nremoval from original habitats involved ecological damage. A particular collection and \nownership compulsion that overcomes many tourists is also revealed. Not only shells and stones, \nbut also fragments of the Great Wall of China, The Acropolis and Uluru are collected, larger \nartworks and cultural objects are bought and second homes are purchased. But more than this \nHirst seems to be alluding to a particular futility or at least dilemma of collection. In collecting \nand presenting these shells they have been transformed from living to dead things. There is a \nfigurative parallel here that almost all souvenirs when taken for their original context suffer \ndiminution. This ranges from food and beverages, to clothing and artworks. Indeed this gallery \nand the exhibition closes with Donnelly\u2019s Nude Sunbather in Butter (2003) \nhttp:\/\/www.people.vcu.edu\/~nalamper\/Helen%20Donnelly%20Website\/images\/lady1.gif \ndemonstrating the transience of tourism experience. The medium of this piece \u2013 butter \u2013 meant \nthat what had been created (the sunbather) was subject to immediate decay. \nCONCLUSION \nThis article has made five contributions to the understanding of tourism. First it has offered a \nthick and rich artistic description of the phenomenon. It has done this by intermingling text and \nimage to provide a reading that goes beyond the restrictions of text which include conventional \nstructures, the linearity of sentences and paragraphs and the limited explanatory power of words. \nSecond it has used artistic licence to provide a novel reading of tourism. Art extends our insights \nbeyond the literal and more easily allows the symbolic, the impressionistic, the imaginative, the \nironic and the surreal to challenge and extend our thinking. It reveals some aspects of tourism \nthat are beyond the reach of words. Third it has developed a novel method, that of virtual \ncurating, to achieve these aims. Fourth is has extended the boundaries of the conventional journal \narticle to harness the potential power of hyperlinks. Finally it has offered fresh insights into \nissues of representation. In particular the discussion in Gallery I instigated by Magritte\u2019s The \nTreachery of Image has opened up a novel reading of the relationship between the phenomenon \nof tourism and its representation. Indeed readers who have warmed to the exquisite subtlety, the \nelegant simplicity of expression yet the highly compressed complexity concerning why \n 25 \nMagritte\u2019s Pipe is titled \u201cThis is not a Pipe\u201d are encouraged to leave this article contemplating \nthe possible treachery of research. \n  \nThe treachery of research means that any article in tourism research could equally and accurately \nbe subtitled: \u201cThis is not Tourism\u201d. \n \nREFERENCES \nAitchison, C. and C.
