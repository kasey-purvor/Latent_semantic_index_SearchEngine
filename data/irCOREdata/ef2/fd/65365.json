This suggests planning of the final \ngrip orientation at or before the start of the prehension movement. The current study \nassessed performance of two visual agnosic patients (SB and DF) on a grasping task \nrequiring the planning of final grip posture. Five healthy subjects were also tested. \nSubjects were required to grasp a triangular-section block, which was presented at one \nof seven different orientations (80-140\u00b0). The healthy subjects showed a consistent \nrelation between object orientation and hand orientation just before contact. In \naddition, they consistently used a clockwise grasp when object orientation was less \nthan 100\u00b0, and an anti-clockwise grasp when it was more than 110\u00b0, with a sharply-\ndefined switch-point being identifiable for each subject. For both visual agnosic \npatients, hand orientation was also reliably related to object orientation.  However, the \nselection of grasp posture was markedly abnormal: they did not consistently switch \nbetween clockwise and anti-clockwise grasps within the normal orientation range, and \nthe switch, when it did occur, was not at all sharply defined. These results suggest that \nthe planning of hand orientation during a grasp depends on a perceptually-based \njudgement of the awkwardness of alternative movements. This would presumably \ninvolve ventral stream processing, which is disrupted in the visual agnosic patients. \n \n \nKeywords: Visual agnosia; ventral stream; orientation; grasping; end-state comfort \n 3 \nIntroduction \nIn the last fifteen years or so, several studies have investigated the relative \ncontribution of the two visual cortical processing streams in different visually-based \ntasks. Early studies investigating task-dependent processing suggested that the dorsal \nstream is critically necessary for the immediate online control of goal-directed action, \nwhilst the ventral stream is crucial for the recognition of objects. Evidence for this \ndissociation came originally from monkey neurophysiology (Sakata, Taira, Murata, & \nMine, 1995) and human neuropsychological single case studies (Goodale, Milner, \nJakobson, & Carey, 1991; Milner & Goodale, 1995; Milner et al., 1991), but has more \nrecently been supported through other methodologies such as functional \nneuroimaging (Culham et al., 2003; James, Culham, Humphrey, Milner, & Goodale, \n2003) and TMS (Desmurget et al., 1999; Rice, Tunik, & Grafton, 2006). Particularly \nimportant has been the study of visual form agnosic patient DF, whose damage \nincludes ventral stream area LO bilaterally (James et al., 2003). This patient could not \nidentify the width of a rectangular shape, nor was she able to report the orientation of \na slot (Goodale et al., 1991; Milner et al., 1991). Nevertheless, she was able to use the \nsame visual information for grasping the rectangular shape or posting an object \nthrough the slot. \n \nOther studies have confirmed her ability to use visual input about the orientation of an \nobject for online guidance of hand orientation during a grasping movement (Carey, \nHarvey, & Milner, 1996; Dijkerman, Milner, & Carey, 1996).  However, these studies \nalso showed impairments in grasping behaviour under particular task conditions. \nCarey et al. (1996) reported that DF did not consistently grasp the appropriate part of \neveryday utensils, despite being able to adjust hand orientation to object orientation. \nThis suggests that she was unable to use stored knowledge about the function of an \n 4 \nobject to guide the selection of a semantically appropriate grasp, although she could \nstill use orientation information to execute the selected grasp efficiently.  Overall, \nthese findings suggest that ventral stream processing may be crucial for certain \naspects of hand orientation during reaching and grasping, for example when \nrecognition of the object is required. \n \nIt is well known that many aspects of a visuomotor act need to be pre-planned based \non the available visual input.  For example, Rosenbaum, Heugten, & Caldwell (1996) \nreported the \u201cend-state comfort\u201d effect when grasping an object in order to make a \nsecond movement with it. They observed that the handle was grasped with such a \nhand orientation that a comfortable hand configuration was achieved at the end of the \nsecond movement, even if the intermediate hand configuration at the end of the first \nmovement was not always comfortable. The end-state comfort effect can only be \nachieved through planning at the start of the movement what the end posture will be. \nAnother example comes from a study by Stelmach, Castiello, & Jeannerod (1994). \nWhen normal subjects grasp an elongated object with a triangular cross-section placed \nat different orientations in the horizontal plane with their right hand, they change from \na \u201ethumb left\u201f (clockwise) to a \u201ethumb right\u201f (anti-clockwise) grip when the \norientation exceeds about 110\u00b0, with respect to the mid-sagittal plane. This suggests \nthat, the final grip orientation (and thereby the direction of hand rotation during the \nmovement) is chosen at or before the start of the prehension movement. This type of \nplanning is influenced by contextual visual illusions such as the rod and frame illusion \n(Craje, van der Kamp, & Steenbergen, 2008) and is considered to depend on visual \nprocessing within the ventral stream (Goodale & Milner, 2004; Milner & Goodale, \n1995, see also Liu, Chua, & Enns, 2008), predicting that the ability should be severely \ndisrupted by bilateral ventral stream lesions. The current study tested this prediction \n 5 \nin two patients with visual agnosia, DF and SB, using a version of Stelmach et al\u201fs \ntask (1994), which requires the planning of final grip posture. Some of the data \ncollected with SB have been reported previously in study on visuomotor abilities of \nthis patient (Dijkerman, Le, Demonet, & Milner, 2004). Movement execution of SB \nhas been analyzed more carefully in this study and compared to that of DF and \nhealthy controls, allowing more comprehensive results\/conclusions. \n \nMethodology \nParticipants \nDF: This patient experienced carbon monoxide poisoning in 1988, resulting in a \nsevere visual form agnosia (Milner et al., 1991). Recent high-resolution structural \nMRI has confirmed a dense bilateral lesion in lateral prestriate cortex, which \nfunctional MRI has shown to coincide with the lateral occipital area (LO), an area in \nthe ventral stream that is implicated in object perception (James et al., 2003). \nFunctional MRI also shows that the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) in DF\u201fs dorsal \nstream remains functional during object grasping. DF performed the present \nexperiment twice, once at the age of 45 and a second time at the age of 48. \n \nSB: This patient, a right-handed man, suffered from an attack of viral meningo-\nencephalitis at the age of 3 years. At the time of testing, at the age of 31 years, SB \nretained a severe object, letter and face recognition deficit. Although he can \ndescribe the contours of a visually-presented object, he cannot identify the object \nin most cases. SB\u201fs perceptual capacities and pattern of brain damage have already \nbeen described in detail in an earlier paper (Le et al., 2002). For more extensive \ndescriptions of SB\u201fs visuomotor abilities see Dijkerman, Le, Demonet, & Milner \n 6 \n(2004).  MRI structural scans revealed large lesions of occipito-parietal and occipito-\ntemporal regions in the right hemisphere, and at the occipito-temporal junction in the \nleft hemisphere (Le et al., 2002). The right-hemisphere lesion includes complete or \npartial damage to the human counterparts of the monkey\u201fs V2, V3, V4 and MT, and \nalso to area LO. In addition there is limited damage to the right inferior parietal lobule \nin the region of the supramarginal gyrus. The spared regions in the right occipital pole \ninclude the calcarine fissure (primary visual cortex, V1) at least in its rostral and \nsuperior aspects. In the left hemisphere, the lesions involve mainly the ventrolateral \nvisual cortex, including a complete destruction of the fusiform gyrus and area LO. In \nsummary, the lesions seem to have all but destroyed the visual ventral stream \nbilaterally, while sparing the occipital pole and the left dorsal stream. \n \nFive healthy female control subjects (mean age 30.8 years, range 24-41 years) with \nnormal (or corrected to normal) vision were also tested. \n \n \n \nFig. 1: The two different ways of orienting the finger opposition space in the present grasping \ntask. Normal subjects grasp objects that are placed at orientations less than 90\u00b0 (with 0\u00b0 \nbeing aligned parallel to the midsagittal axis) with their thumb on the left and their index finger \non the right (clockwise, top picture).  They switch to an \u2018anti-clockwise\u2019 grasp when the object \nis placed at 110\u00b0 or higher (bottom picture). \n \n 7 \nProcedure and experimental set up \nFollowing a task devised by Stelmach et al. (1994), we asked participants to grasp, \nwithout lifting, a triangular-section prism block (6 cm long by 2.5 cm wide), made out \nof dark grey plastic. Because its section was an equilateral triangle, the object offered \nonly one effective grip pattern, with the thumb and fingertips in opposition at the two \nends: it could not be picked up sideways, without it slipping out of one\u201fs grip (see Fig \n1).  The object was placed on a white table top, with its centre 30 cm away from the \nstarting position along the subject\u201fs midsagittal axis. The starting position was 5 cm \naway from the table edge. The target object was presented at one of seven different \norientations (80-140\u00b0 in steps of 10\u00b0, with 0\u00b0 being with its main axis parallel to the \nmid-sagittal axis). Each target orientation was presented ten times in a pseudo-\nrandomized order. \nINSERT FIG 1 ABOUT HERE \nThe Minibird (Ascension Technology Corporation) magnetic recording system was \nused for recording the reaching and grasping movements. The positions of markers \nattached to the nails of the thumb and forefinger of the right hand were tracked for 3 s \nat a sampling rate of 103Hz.  Start and end times of the grasping movement were \ndetermined by using a velocity based criterion (5 cm\/s for the thumb marker).  \n \nData analyses \nGrasp orientation was determined throughout the movement. This was achieved by \ncalculating the angle of a straight line drawn through the markers on the index finger \nand thumb, with respect to the sagittal plane, for each frame. Several variables were \nextracted from the grasp orientation data. First, the reaching movements were \nnormalized with respect to time, with each movement being divided into 100 samples. \nThe grasp orientation measured at 2 normalized samples before the end of the \n 8 \nmovement was examined as a function of the object orientation. Second, the grasp \nposture was classed as clockwise if this orientation was signed positively (with 0 \ndegrees being the index finger-thumb axis being aligned parallel to the midsagittal \naxis), and as anti-clockwise if it was signed negatively (see Figure 1). For each \nparticipant, the percentage of anti-clockwise grasps was calculated for each object \norientation. In order to describe the dependence of grasp posture on object orientation \nin a manner analogous to a psychophysical analysis, the best-fitting sigmoid curve \nwas calculated for each participant\u201fs data. Provided that a reliable fit was obtained, \ntwo (pseudo-psychophysical) parameters were derived. The \u201eswitch-point\u201f was \ncalculated as the object orientation at which the frequency of anti-clockwise grasps \nwas equal to 50% (analogous to the point of subjective equality in a standard \npsychophysical analysis). The \u201eswitch-sharpness\u201f was calculated as the range of \nobject orientations between anti-clockwise frequencies of 25 and 75% (analogous to \none just noticeable difference in a standard psychophysical analysis). \n \nWe also assessed whether hand orientation was reliably related to object orientation 2 \nsamples before the end of the movement. For this we calculated hand orientation \nirrespective of whether a clockwise or anti-clockwise grip was used. We further \ndivided the grasps into \u201enatural\u201f or \u201eawkward\u201f depending on whether control subjects \nperformed a grasp for that particular object orientation using a clockwise or anti-\nclockwise grip. This meant that all clockwise grasps were classed as \u201enatural\u201f when \nperformed for object orientations between 80-110 degrees, while anti-clockwise \ngrasps were considered to be natural when object orientation was between 100-140 \ndegrees. All other grasps were considered to be \u201eawkward\u201f. The \u201eawkward grasps \nwere excluded from the analyses as biomechanical constraints when performing these \n 9 \nuncomfortable grasps might have influenced hand orientation. A linear regression \nanalyses was performed for each participant only using data from the \u201enatural\u201f grasps \nwith object orientation as independent variable and hand orientation as dependent \nvariable. \n \nTo assess whether the grasp posture had been pre-planned, we examined the change \nof hand orientation over the course of each reach.  Hand orientation was plotted as a \nfunction of normalized time. Hand orientation at 0, 10, 30, 50 and 70% of movement \nduration was calculated in relation to object orientation and to final grip posture \n(clockwise, anti-clockwise). The data were analysed for each subject using t-tests to \ndetermine the stage in the movement at which hand orientation began to differ \naccording to whether the final grasp posture on that trial was to be \u201eclockwise\u201f or \n\u201eanti-clockwise\u201f. The t-tests were carried out on hand orientation measured at 0, 10, \n30, 50 and 70 percent into the movement, with final hand position (clockwise-anti-\nclockwise) as the independent variable. \n \nFinally, standard kinematic measures such as movement time (MT), maximum grip \naperture (MGA), time to maximum grip aperture (TMGA), and time to maximum grip \naperture as percentage of total movement time (%TMGA) were calculated. \n \nResults \nRelation between hand posture and target orientation \nFigure 2 depicts the percentage of clockwise grasps for each orientation per subject. It \nis clear from this figure that the control subjects consistently switch from a \n\u201eclockwise\u201f (positive values) to an \u201eanti-clockwise\u201f (negative values) grip at 100 \u2013 \n 10 \n110 degrees. The \u201eswitch-point\u201f for the control subjects varied between 98.9 and \n111.6 degrees. The \u201eswitch-sharpness\u201f (range of object orientations between anti-\nclockwise frequencies of 75 and 25%) varied between 0.49 and 3.89 degrees, showing \nthat the control subjects changed quite sharply between clockwise and anti-clockwise \ngrips.  \n \n \n \nFig 2: The best-fitting sigmoid curves for grasp posture across object orientations in a manner \nanalogous to a psychophysical analysis for each participant. Two (pseudo-psychophysical) \nparameters were derived. The \u2018switch-point\u2019 was calculated as the object orientation at which \nthe frequency of anti-clockwise grasps was equal to 50% (analogous to the point of subjective \nequality in a standard psychophysical analysis). The \u2018switch-sharpness\u2019 was calculated as the \nrange of object orientations between anti-clockwise frequencies of 25 and 75% (analogous to \none just noticeable difference in a standard psychophysical analysis). \n \nAs can be seen in Figure 2, SB and DF showed a different pattern. In the first testing \nsession DF did not change hand orientations at a particular object orientation. Instead \nshe used both grips over a range of object orientations (90-120 degrees) and only \nshowed a consistent grip for the extreme object orientations (80 degrees: clockwise; \n130-140 degrees anti-clockwise). Indeed, although her \u201eswitch-point\u201f was within the \nnormal range for this session (110.10 degrees), the \u201eswitch sharpness\u201f was not (8.50 \ndegrees).  In the second session, the \u201eswitch-point\u201f as well as the \u201eswitch sharpness\u201f \nare outside the normal range (129.9 degrees and 6.2 degrees respectively) suggesting \n 11 \nthat DF only changes to an anti-clockwise grasp for the object orientations 130 and \n140 degrees.  As we already described previously (Dijkerman et al., 2004), SB also \ndid not change between grips at a certain object orientation. Instead, he always \ngrasped the object in an anti-clockwise manner, except for three trials at 80 and 90 \ndegrees. It was not possible to calculate the \u201eswitch-point\u201f or \u201eswitch sharpness\u201f for \nhis data, since no sigmoid function could be fitted reliably to his data. \n \n \n \nFig 3: Hand orientation 2 normalized frames before the end of the movement as a function of \nobject orientation, irrespective of whether the grasp was clockwise or anti-clockwise. Visual \nagnosic participants DF (two sessions) and SB are depicted in the first three graphs on the \ntop row. The healthy control subjects are shown in the remaining graph on the top row and in \nthe bottom four graphs. The hand orientations are coded according to whether they are \nnatural (e.g. \u2018clockwise\u2019 grip for object orientations 90-110 or \u2018anti-clockwise\u2019 grip for object \norientations 100-140, filled circles) or awkward (all other trials, open circles). A linear \nregression was performed for natural trials only. Hand orientation just before the end of the \nmovement was highly related to object orientation for all participants including DF and SB. \n \n \nFigure 3 depicts hand orientations at two frames before the end of the movement \nirrespective of whether the grip was clockwise or anti-clockwise. A linear regression \nanalysis for each individual performed on the \u201enatural\u201f grasps showed that, for all \n 12 \nparticipants, including the agnosic patients, hand orientation just prior to the end of \nthe movement was reliably related to object orientation (minimum r\n2\n = 0.70). This \nsuggests that visual input about the object orientation was used to adjust the hand \norientation during the grasping movement. Thus, although the agnosic patients adjust \ntheir hand orientation during the grasping movement to the object orientation, they do \nnot consistently pre-select a particular hand-grip posture, in contrast to all control \nsubjects.  \n \nNext we determined the point during the grasping movement at which it became clear \nthat the object was going to be grasped with a clockwise or anti-clockwise grip. \nControl subjects presumably pre-plan this decision. If the agnosic patients, however, \nare impaired in planning the grasping movement, the decision to adopt a certain grip \nmay be deferred until after the movement has started. We used independent samples t-\ntests to assess at what part of the movement a reliable difference between hand \norientations leading to a 'clockwise' and an 'anti-clockwise' grasp could be observed. \nThis was done for DF only, as SB performed only three grasps with a 'thumb to the \nleft' grip. The results show that for four out of five control subjects a difference \nbetween \u201eclockwise\u201f and 'anti-clockwise' grip can already be detected after 10% of the \nmovement (see Table 1 and Figure 4). For the remaining control subject, the \ndifference becomes significant at 30% into the movement. For DF, the difference \nbetween the two types of grip is also significant at 10% of the total movement in both \nsessions. DF therefore performs similarly to the control subjects in that she selects her \ngrip prior to, or early during, the movement, in a normal fashion.  However, a \nsignificant difference was also found in both sessions for DF\u201fs initial hand orientation \nat the first frame of the movement (see Table 1). This was not the case for any of the \ncontrol subjects and suggests that DF\u201fs final grip may partly be determined by her \n 13 \ninitial hand orientation. Inspection of SB\u201fs changes in hand orientation over time \nsuggests that he too planned his grip before, or early in, the movement on almost all \ntrials. However, it is also clear from Figure 4 that although grasp posture was usually \npre-selected, there are occasional instances where participants change between one \nand another grip online. This tendency was not notably more marked in the patients \nthan amongst the controls. \n \nTable 1: Independent samples t-test, assessing at which stage of the movement a \nsignificant difference could be detected between \u2018clockwise\u2019 and \u2018anti-clockwise\u2019 \ngrips. \n \n At start of the \nmovement \nAfter 10% After 30% After 50% After 70% \nHC1 T(64)=1.46, \np=.19 \nT(64) = 1.56, \np=.12 \nT(64)=19.60, \np<.001  \nT(64)=56.24, \np<.001  \nT(64)=64.33, \np<.001  \nHC2 T(68)=1.61, \np=.12 \nT(68)=4.08, \np<.001  \nT(68)=16.62, \np<.001  \nT(68)=30.15, \np<.001  \nT(68)=63.40, \np<.001  \nHC3 T(68)=1.73, \nP=.09 \nT(68)=3.30,p=.0\n02  \nT(68)=18.57, \np<.001  \nT(68)=32.81, \np<.001  \nT(68)=39.39, \np<.001  \nHC4 T(64)=.07, \nP=.94 \nT(64)=3.11, \np=.003 \nT(64)=15.05, \np<.001  \nT(64)=40.74, \np<.001  \nT(64)=49.35, \np<.001  \nHC5 T(68)=1.17, \nP=.25 \nT(68)=5.54, \np<.001  \nT(68)=24.02, \np<.001  \nT(68)=35.45, \np<.001  \nT(68)=41.12, \np<.001  \nDF \n \nDF2  \nT(60)=5.23, \np<.001 \nT(65)=-3.89, \np<.001 \nT(60)=8.71, \np<.001  \nT(65)=-6.30, \np<.001  \nT(60)=22.04, \np<.001  \nT(65)=-9.89, \np<.001 \nT(60)=22.85, \np<.001  \nT(65)=-11.38, \np<.001 \nT(63)=21.52, \np<.001  \nT(65)=-11.61, \np<.001  \n \n 14 \n \n \nFig 4: Hand orientation during the course of the movement for each individual trial.

Both DF and SB fail to show the normal sharp switch of \nwrist posture between clockwise and anti-clockwise as the orientation of a centrally \nplaced elongated object changes with respect to the subject (Stelmach et al., 1994; see \nDijkerman et al., 2004 for an earlier report of this finding for SB). In healthy subjects \nthis switch in posture occurs at approximately 100-110 degrees clockwise from the \nsagittal axis. Of course all subjects can generally still grasp the object even when they \nhave chosen the \u201ewrong\u201f wrist posture to adopt, but doing so is uncomfortable, and \noften results in poorer orientation scaling (see Figure 3, DF session 2) and fumbling \nmovements to secure the grasp. Indeed, informal observations during the testing of \nboth DF and SB revealed awkward grasps during several trials. Healthy subjects \n 16 \ntherefore usually pre-emptively avoid this problem by planning the more appropriate \nposture of the hand before initiating the reach. \n \nThe absence of a normal \u201eswitch\u201f point in DF and SB\u201fs data is presumably due to the \nneed for a perceptually-based anticipatory judgement of the awkwardness of the \nalternative movements, and then a postural decision based on this analysis. Both SB \nand DF therefore would be expected to have difficulty because they are impaired in \nthe necessary perceptual analysis that must inform such a decision (Le et al., 2002; \nMilner et al., 1991).  Both DF and SB have suffered severe damage to the ventral \nstream systems that underlie the perception of shape and pattern, causing visual form \nagnosia (James et al., 2003; Le et al., 2002; Milner et al., 1991).  We may infer that \nboth patients would therefore have an imperfect or impoverished perceptual \nrepresentation of the solid shape that was presented to them on each trial, including its \norientation on the table.  It may be assumed that their well-documented perceptual \ndeficits prevent adequate action selection.  \n \nAlthough both patients are impaired when selecting their grip, they manifest their \ndeficits differently. While SB almost always grasps with an anti-clockwise grip, DF \nshows a more variable response, which nevertheless does not show the sharp switch \npoint as observed in the control subjects. Several factors may contribute to this \ndifference between the two patients. First, although both SB and DF suffered bilateral \ndamage to the ventral stream, the lesion was more extensive in SB, which may have \nresulted in his qualitatively different pattern of grasp selection (e.g. very few switches \nbetween clockwise and anti-clockwise grasps). A second explanation may be that the \ntwo patients, though both faced with an inability to select the correct grip on a \nperceptual estimate of the object orientation, resorted to different strategies to deal \n 17 \nwith this; for example adopting a \u201edefault\u201f selection based either on the hand \norientation at the start of the movement (DF), or their own preference for one type of \ngrip over the other (SB). \n \nYet however inappropriately selected their actions are, both patients still proceed to \nprogram their grasps (as evidenced by standard kinematic measures) and particularly \ntheir finger-thumb grip orientation to the object orientation with considerable skill, in \nagreement with previous studies (Carey et al., 1996; Dijkerman et al., 2004; Goodale \net al., 1991; Milner et al., 1991).  Indeed as Figure 4 shows, DF and SB executed \ngrasps comfortably in most of the trials, with pre-programming of the movement from \nthe outset (cf Milner et al., 1991).  The data thus reveal a dissociation between two \ndifferent requirements for the successful performance of a visuomotor action.  Each \npatient has a preserved ability to execute a visually-guided grasp, despite performing \nabnormally on planning the appropriate overall posture for the action in the first \nplace.  To put it another way, our patients cannot successfully use visual orientation \ninformation to make an initial action selection, but are able to use visual information \nto calibrate their actions once the action has been selected, despite partial damage to \ndorsal stream visual areas in both patients. \n \nCarey et al. (1996) showed that DF was impaired when required to select to \nappropriate parts of everyday utensils for grasping, again despite normal grip \norientation. Grip selection in this task presumably requires recognition of the object \nand retrieval of semantic information about the function of the tool. In the current \nstudy, object recognition and semantic information were not required to select the \ncorrect grip. This suggests that ventral stream involvement in grasp selection does not \n 18 \ndepend necessarily on object recognition or semantic processing but may also be \nrequired when predicting the final posture of a grasp. In general, the ventral stream \nmay to be critically involved in visuomotor behaviour when whenever anticipatory \nmental simulation of an action is required for selection of the form of the action. \nPrevious studies have shown that patient DF is impaired in grasping, pointing, or \nmaking saccades based on memorized visual input  (Goodale, Jakobson, & Keillor, \n1994; Milner, Dijkerman, & Carey, 1999). In contrast, after posterior parietal lesions, \noptic ataxic patients improve their visuomotor performance after a delay between \ntarget presentation and grasping or pointing response  (Milner et al., 2001; Milner, \nPaulignan, Dijkerman, Michel, & Jeannerod, 1999). The current study suggests the \nventral stream is also involved when planning a grasp depends on predictions about \nits consequences. Thus, based on the assumption that the performance of DF and SB \nshow the dorsal stream operating in isolation, the current findings reveal another \nlimitation to visuomotor processing in this stream. Whereas it is capable to adjust \nhand orientation to the object orientation during the grasp, the dorsal stream is not \nable to predict the awkwardness of the final posture and adjust the grasp accordingly. \nSimilarly, the ventral stream and frontal areas appear to be required for the control of \nnew as opposed to overlearned visuomotor skills, again illustrating the limitations of \ndorsal\u2013stream processing (Gonzalez, Ganel, Whitwell, Morrissey, & Goodale, 2008; \nGrol, de Lange, Verstraten, Passingham, & Toni, 2006).  \n \nA critical distinction has been made elsewhere between the planning and \nprogramming of an action (Goodale & Milner, 2004; Milner & Goodale, 2008). \nProgramming of an action involves pre-specification of movement parameters based \non visual information about the object\u201fs size, shape, orientation and egocentric \n 19 \nposition. These movement parameters bear a direct relation to the visual \ncharacteristics, e.g. maximum grip aperture depends on size of object, and hand \norientation on object orientation. As such there is a relatively direct translation of \nvisual parameters in motor parameters. In contrast, planning of an action does not \ninvolve direct visual to motor transformations, but rather relates to the initial selection \nof higher order aspects of the movement such as the type of grip with which the \nobject is grasped, or whether to grasp it with one or with two hands (van Doorn et al., \n2007). This can be influenced by previous motor experience, but also by stored \nknowledge about the object to be grasped (Carey et al., 1996). This distinction \nbetween planning and programming has been blurred by some writers, who have \nconflated both aspects of action preparation as \u201cplanning\u201d (Glover, 2004).  It is clear \nthat the unfolding of DF and SB\u201fs actions, as shown in Figure 4, must be based on \nintact action programming, despite faulty action planning. \n 20 \nReferences \nCarey, D.
