Magnetospheric cusp, ionosphere, reconnec-\ntion, convection flow-channel, Cluster, ground-based obser-\nvations\n1 Introduction\nThe term \u201ccusp\u201d is today applied to a number of characteris-\ntics of the dayside magnetosphere: in particular, the magnetic\ncusp, the particle cusp, the cusp aurora and the cusp currents.\nThe concept that we now term the magnetic cusp is as old as\nthe concept that we now term the magnetosphere. Both first\nappeared in the paper by Chapman and Ferraro (1931). For a\nmodel planar magnetopause, they defined two magnetic null\npoints on the magnetopause around which the magnetopause\nsurface currents circle (JCF \u2013 \u201cChapman-Ferraro\u201d current).\nThese are connected by field lines, that Chapman and Fer-\nraro termed \u201cHorns\u201d, to a single point in the dayside auroral\nionosphere. For a generalised magnetopause shape, the cusp\nremains as a topological boundary around noon that separates\nfield lines passing through the dayside magnetosphere from\nthose extending anti-sunward into the tail lobe. For a given\nnotional electric field imposed on the magnetosphere by the\nsolar wind flow (ESW from dawn to dusk for purely south-\nward IMF), the cusp can be regarded as the location where\n(JCF \u00b7 ESW ) reverses from positive to negative. Thus, sun-\nward of the magnetic cusp, energy goes from the field to the\nparticles (JCF \u00b7ESW > 0), whereas anti-sunward of the cusp\nenergy goes from the particles to the fields (JCF \u00b7ESW < 0)\n(Cowley, 1991).\nThe discovery of magnetosheath-like plasma precipitating\ninside the magnetosphere (Heikkila and Winningham, 1971;\nFrank, 1971) was initially interpreted in terms of particle\nentry at the null points of the magnetic cusp in a closed\nmagnetosphere; hence, the particle signature itself was also\ngiven the name cusp. However, transfer of plasma into a null\npoint is not an adequate explanation since a breakdown of the\n\u201cfrozen-in field\u201d condition is still required in order to provide\ntransfer onto magnetospheric field lines. It was soon realised\nthat magnetosheath plasma actually precipitated over a broad\nlocal time sector on the dayside (Formisano et al., 1980),\nand so the additional concept of the \u201ccleft\u201d, which maps to a\nclosed LLBL field line torus containing sheath plasma, was\nintroduced by Heikkila (1972). Although this conceptual dif-\nference was introduced as early as 1972, a quantitative dif-\nference between the cusp and the cleft was not defined until\nthe work of Newell and Meng (1988). Various mechanisms\nfor populating a closed LLBL with sheath plasma have been\nproposed, while others have argued that there is no need to\ninvoke a closed LLBL at all. It appears that all the features\nof the LLBL can be interpreted in terms of open field lines\nthat have either been reconnected only very recently (alter-\nnatively have been re-closed), or which thread the magne-\ntopause away from the subsolar point where magnetosheath\nnumber densities are lower (Lockwood and Smith, 1993;\nFuselier et al., 1999). This latter concept can indeed explain\na number of long-standing anomalies in the magnetosphere\n(Lockwood, 1997a).\nThere is widespread agreement with the concept that the\nparticle cusp is where the shocked solar wind plasma of the\nmagnetosheath has the most direct entry into the magneto-\nsphere (Newell and Meng, 1988; 1992). Thus, irrespective\nof the mechanism invoked which gives rise to that entry, it\nis agreed that the cusp is where injected sheath plasma has\ncharacteristics, in terms of the concentration and tempera-\nture of the ion and electron gases, that are most similar to the\ncorresponding values in the external magnetosheath. There\nis less agreement as to what this means in terms of the quan-\ntitative identification of the cusp. One difficulty is that the\nmagnetosheath conditions vary both temporally (in response\nto the wide range of variations in the upstream solar wind)\nand spatially (primarily with distance from the nose of the\nmagnetosphere) (Spreiter et al., 1966). Given that, for exam-\nple, hourly averages of the upstream solar wind number den-\nsity can vary from almost zero to 85\u00d7 106 m3 (with a mode\nvalue of 3 \u00d7 106 m3) (Hapgood et al., 1991); such a tempo-\nral variation must imply that any quantitative criteria used to\ndefine the cusp should have threshold values that depend on\nthe upstream solar wind conditions in an appropriate man-\nner. The spatial variation of the sheath plasma introduces the\ncomplication that quantitative comparison with the cusp de-\npends on which location in the magnetosheath is considered\nmost relevant \u2013 a judgement which depends on the adopted\nmodel of the plasma injection.\nIn a closed magnetosphere, the entire magnetopause maps\nto the ionosphere only at the singular points envisaged by\nChapman and Ferraro. The addition of open flux threading\nthe magnetopause means that this point is enlarged into a\nnon-zero region (Crooker et al., 1991). In the open magne-\ntosphere, a boundary-normal field is added to those parts of\nthe magnetopause where the newly-opened field lines evolve\naway from a reconnection site. We can make a simple es-\ntimate of the area of the cusp for an open magnetosphere\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1369\nusing an average transpolar voltage of 50 kV generated by\nreconnection. Such reconnection can commence somewhere\nin a fully-closed magnetopause. Since the ionospheric field\nis roughly constant at 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 T, the area of the cusp in\nthe ionosphere grows at a rate of 5 \u00d7 104\/(5 \u00d7 10\u22125) =\n109 m2 s\u22121. This growth would continue for about 10 min,\nafter which the field lines would no longer be classified as\ncusp (because they thread the tail rather than the dayside\nmagnetopause, and also because the precipitation in the iono-\nsphere would be classified as mantle or polar cap rather than\ncusp (Lockwood and Davis, 1995). By this time, the area\nof the ionospheric cusp has grown from zero to 6\u00d7 105 km2.\nGiven that the peak cusp width is observed to be roughly at 5\u25e6\nof latitude (about 600 km) (Newell et al., 1989), this means\nthat the longitudinal extent has grown to about 1000 km (cor-\nresponding to about 2.5 h of Magnetic Local Time). The def-\ninition of the cusp employed in some statistical surveys re-\nsults in smaller estimates of the cusp extent, but the above\nis consistent with the results from several surveys of mag-\nnetosheath plasma in the magnetosphere (e.g. Newell et al.,\n1989; Newell and Meng, 1992; Stubbs et al., 2001).\nA key characteristic often displayed by magnetosheath\nplasma precipitating in the cusp is the dispersion of the ions\nin energy, mass, and pitch angle. The ions are dispersed ac-\ncording to their field parallel time-of-flight in the \u201cvelocity\nfilter effect\u201d (Rosenbauer et al., 1975; Reiff et al., 1977).\nThis effect means that ions injected from one point on the\nmagnetopause are dispersed in the convective flow on their\npath of precipitation along the magnetic field. During periods\nof southward IMF and anti-sunward convection, the latitude-\nenergy dispersion is reversed in direction compared to pe-\nriods of northward IMF with sunward convection (Burch et\nal., 1982, 1985; Woch and Lundin, 1992). However, the cusp\nions detected also display a range of ion energies and pitch\nangles at any one observation point and this reveals that the\nmagnetopause source must be an extended region (of the or-\nder of 10 RE) along the flow streamlines of newly-opened\nfield lines (Lockwood and Smith, 1993). Reconnection pro-\nvides a unique explanation of this extended source region\nsince once a field line is opened, the plasma streams con-\ntinuously across the boundary. Onsager et al. (1993) demon-\nstrated this principle by modelling ions injected onto newly-\nopened field lines but since they employed a low steady-state\naverage convection electric field, they did not predict as great\nan extent of the source region for the cusp particles as in\nthe time-dependent model of Lockwood (1995; 1997b). The\nions observed are first accelerated as they cross the magne-\ntopause (for an open magnetosphere, this is the Alfve\u00b4n wave\nthat is launched by the reconnection site into the inflow from\nthe magnetosheath side of the boundary; Vasyliunas, 1995)\nat locations between the reconnection site and the magnetic\ncusp (where JCF \u00b7ESW > 0) (Hill and Reiff, 1977; Cowley,\n1981), but they are then decelerated poleward of the magnetic\ncusp (where JCF \u00b7 ESW > 0) (Lockwood, 1995). Ions are\nalso accelerated by passing through the other Alfve\u00b4n wave\nthat was launched by the reconnection site into the inflow\nfrom the magnetospheric side of the boundary (Lockwood,\n1997a, b) and by other similarly-produced Alfve\u00b4nic distur-\nbances, such as slow-mode shocks and expansion fans (Lock-\nwood and Hapgood, 1998). Other ions will be accelerated\nabove solar wind energies at the bow shock (Fuselier et al.,\n1999), where JBS \u00b7ESW > 0 (Cowley, 1991).\nThe reconnection theory of the cusp predicts that at the\ndayside magnetopause, magnetosheath plasma will be seen\nwithin a layer on northward-pointing newly-opened field\nlines. Here, we refer to this layer as the \u201cexterior\u201d cusp,\nand it is sometimes also called the \u201centry layer\u201d or \u201cfrontside\nboundary layer\u201d (Haerendel et al., 1978) or the (open)\nLLBL (Paschmann et al., 1986). The plasma in the exterior\ncusp will be recognisably different from the magnetosheath\nproper. First, the accelerated ions discussed above will be\npresent (but note that these are also found in the magne-\ntosheath boundary layer formed by the open field lines out-\nside the magnetopause). Second, the plasma concentration\nwill be roughly half the sheath value at the point of entry\nbecause roughly half the sheath plasma is transmitted and\nhalf is reflected at the magnetopause (Cowley, 1982; Fuse-\nlier et al., 1991). Third, the ion velocity distributions will\nbe ordered by the magnetic field direction instead of by the\nmagnetosheath flow.\nCusp plasma is also seen on the southward-pointing field\nlines of the \u201cinterior\u201d cusp along which the plasma precip-\nitates into the ionosphere. It is also seen on the field lines\nthat point anti-sunward\/sunward with small BZ in the north-\nern\/southern hemisphere, connecting the open LLBL with\nthe magnetic cusp. The reconnection theory of the cusp is\nunique in predicting that the ion precipitation can be con-\ntinuously dispersed across the regions classed as \u201c(open)\nLLBL\u201d, \u201ccusp\u201d, \u201cmantle\u201d and \u201cpolar cap\u201d as the field lines\nevolve from the reconnection site into the tail lobe (Lock-\nwood, 1997b). Most field lines will evolve anti-sunward\nclose to the magnetic cusp. Spatial and temporal structure in\nthe reconnection means that this continuous dispersion will\nnot always be observed, but the fact that it is observed when\nthe reconnection is relatively steady and constant (Onsager\net al., 1993; Lockwood et al., 1994) is highly significant.\nFor the most recently-opened field lines, electrons, like\nions, can also show time-of-flight velocity dispersion effects\n(Burch et al., 1982; Gosling et al., 1990b). After a field line\nis opened, the first effect is the loss of the magnetospheric\nelectrons: field-parallel and higher energy electrons are lost\nfirst. The second effect is the arrival of some lower-energy\nmagnetosheath electrons. However, the full flux of sheath\nelectrons does not arrive until the magnetosheath ions arrive.\nIn general, the number density of electrons in the cusp is al-\nways very close to that of the ions (Burch, 1985; Lockwood\nand Hapgood, 1998). How this \u201cquasi-neutrality\u201d is main-\ntained on newly-opened field lines as they evolve is one of\nthe main current problems in understanding the cusp.\nThe magnetosheath electrons and ions which precipitate\ninto the cusp\/cleft ionosphere generate a characteristic au-\nrora. The relatively low energies of these particles result in an\naurora dominated by high altitude 630.0 and 636.4 nm (red\nline) emissions of atomic oxygen, with much lower intensi-\n1370 H. J.

The UT times for the momentary location of\nCluster are indicated every 4 h, starting in the southern hemisphere,\nthrough perigee and towards the final exit from the magnetopause\nin the northern hemisphere.

This is due to\nthe fact that the 1D2 electron state is readily excited (1.96 eV\nabove the 3P doublet ground state), whereas very few atoms\nare excited to the 1S0 (4.17 eV above the 3P ). The excita-\ntion can be largely caused by the elevation of the ionospheric\nelectron temperature such that the electrons on the hot tail\nof the thermal ionospheric gas are very efficient in exciting\nthe 1D2 state (Wickwar and Kofman, 1984; Lockwood et al.,\n1993a; Davis and Lockwood, 1996). A region of dominant\nred-line emission was first reported by Sandford (1964). This\nwas shown to be poleward of the more energetic dayside au-\nroral precipitation by Eather and Mende (1971). The associa-\ntion with the newly-discovered cusp precipitation was made\nby Heikkila (1972). This red-line aurora either contains or\nconsists of a series of poleward-moving events when the IMF\nis southward (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1985; 1992).\nThe electron heating in the cusp region which was in-\nvoked above as a major cause of the cusp\/cleft aurora was\ninferred in a statistical survey of the topside ionosphere by\nTitheridge (1976) and has been directly observed by satellite\n(Brace et al., 1982; Curtis et al., 1982) and incoherent scatter\nradar (Wickwar and Kofman, 1984; Watermann et al., 1994;\nMcCrea et al., 2000). With very high time resolution (10 s)\nmeasurements, Lockwood et al. (1993b) have reported that\nthe cusp electron temperature enhancements can sometimes\nconsist of a series of poleward-moving events, very similar\nto the behaviour of the red-line auroral transients.\nThe direction of the curvature force on newly-opened field\nlines depends on the IMF BY component, and this gives\nthe longitudinal motion of newly-opened field lines that is\nobserved at the magnetopause (Gosling et al., 1990a) and\nin the ionosphere (Cowley, 1981; Greenwald et al., 1990).\nThe polarity of the electric fields and Hall, Pedersen and\nfield-aligned currents that are associated with this Svalgaard-\nMansurov effect depend on the BY component and on the\nhemisphere considered. The term \u201ccusp\u201d is sometimes ap-\nplied to the BY -dependent field-aligned currents which bring\nthe east-west flows to the ionosphere (Taguchi et al., 1993).\nOther authors have preferred the title of \u201cmantle\u201d currents\nsince they are sometimes found in the precipitation region\ntermed mantle, rather than in the cusp precipitation region.\nThis debate is best understood in terms of the evolution of\nthe newly-opened field lines; the precipitation evolves from\ncusp to mantle classifications roughly 12 min after reconnec-\ntion. This is also roughly the time scale for a field line to\nstraighten. As the field-aligned currents on newly-opened\nfield lines are associated with this unbending (Saunders,\n1989; Mei et al., 1995), we should expect them to be close to\nthe cusp\/mantle boundary, but they can be in either region in\nany one case. The pattern of field-aligned currents for non-\nzero IMF BY was proposed by Cowley et al. (1991b) from\nconsiderations about how newly-opened field lines evolve.\nThese predictions of where the particle precipitations of var-\nious classifications will be seen relative to the field-aligned\ncurrents are consistent with the observations by de la Beau-\njardiere et al. (1993).\nA major debate exists as to how much the cusp repre-\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1371\nsents a stable, ever-present structure and how much can it\nvary in response to spatial and temporal variations in the re-\nconnection rate (see review by Smith and Lockwood, 1996).\nLockwood and Smith (1992) were the first to suggest that\nthe cusp was made up of newly-opened field lines produced\nby successive reconnection pulses, thereby making the cusp\nthe signature of a series of \u201cflux transfer events\u201d (Cowley et\nal., 1991a). Their work was inspired by the fact that iono-\nspheric signatures of the cusp appeared in various different\nsets of meridional ground-based data as a series of poleward-\nmoving events, whereas satellite data were often interpreted\nin terms of a spatial structure (note that the latter is even im-\nplied by the term cusp itself). The time-dependent recon-\nnection model of the particle cusp can reproduce the struc-\nture seen in cusp ions at low altitudes (Escoubet et al., 1992;\nLockwood and Davis, 1996) at middle altitudes (Lockwood\net al., 1998) and at the magnetopause in flux transfer events\nthemselves (Lockwood and Hapgood, 1998).\nFor clear southward IMF conditions, such consecutive\npoleward moving transients are readily identified in various\nsets of meridional ground-based data, for example, magne-\ntometers (Stauning, 1995; Stauning et al., 1994; Clauer et\nal., 1995; Pilipenko et al., 2000), meridian scanning pho-\ntometers (Sandholt et al., 1992), poleward scanning coher-\nent HF radar systems (Pinnock et al., 1993, 1995; Rodger et\nal., 1994; Rodger and Pinnock, 1997), and poleward point-\ning incoherent scatter radars (Lockwood et al., 1993b). Sev-\neral studies using combined sets of such ground based data\n(Yeoman et al., 1997; Thorolfsson et al., 2000) have iden-\ntified clear spatial and temporal relations between the vari-\nous features of ionospheric and field-aligned currents, iono-\nspheric plasma flow, topside electron heating, and precipita-\ntion. For situations during strongly northward directed IMF,\nsimilar transients have been observed to move equatorward\n(Sandholt, 1991; \u00d8ieroset et al., 1997), which strongly sug-\ngests that reconnection occurs on the dayside lobe field lines.\nFor intermediate IMF directions (i.e. small BZ), Sandholt et\nal. (1996, 1998a, b) and Lockwood and Moen (1999) have\nshown that a bifurcation of the cusp\/cleft aurora can occur,\nwere subsolar reconnection is observed to continue inspite of\na northward IMF component. From the results of McCrea et\nal. (2000, see also references within), it appears that subsolar\nreconnection can continue to occur for as long as BY is suffi-\nciently large compared to BZ , such that the IMF clock angle\nlies within 45\u25e6 of the magnetic equatorial plane.\nThe combination of the four Cluster spacecraft and global\nground-based instrumentation will enable us to fully under-\nstand the dynamics and evolution of the cusp and to follow\nthe various transient features which emanate from it as they\nmake their way into other regions of the magnetosphere-\nionosphere system. In this paper, we will present a wealth\nof coordinated ground-based and Cluster observations dur-\ning an event which we interprete as a transient excursion of\nthe cusp from an initial pre-noon location to the post-noon\n15:00 MLT sector. Various sets of ground-based instrumen-\ntation will be used to identify the dynamics of a quickly\nevolving eastward directed flow-channel, which is associ-\nFig. 2.

Whenever necessary, we will explain the main char-\nacteristic features of the utilised instrumentation in the text\nnext to the presentation of the observations, and refer to more\ninstrument-specific Cluster publications in this issue, or pub-\nlications in the Satellite Ground-Based Coordination Source-\nbook (ESA SP1198).\n2 Observations\n2.1 Interplanetary conditions and overview of some Cluster\nand ESR observations\nOn 14 January 2001, from about 07:00 UT onwards, the\nfour Cluster spacecraft passed through the northern mag-\nnetospheric lobe and mantle on their way towards the day-\nside post-noon magnetopause.

We used a standard Tsyganenko-96\nmodel (Tsyganenko, 1995), and chose the input parameters\nas IMF BY = 3.0 nT, IMF BZ = \u22121.0 nT, a solar wind\npressure of 0.6 nPa and Dst = 0. According to the model,\nclose conjunctions with the ESR and the So\u00a8ndre Stro\u00a8mfjord\n(STF) radars were predicted for 12:00 UT and 15:00 UT, re-\nspectively, with a final exit into the magnetosheath at around\n16:00 UT, corresponding to about 15:00 MLT. In order to\nallow for a closer inspection of the ground-based data with\nrespect to the Cluster measurements in the following sec-\ntions, we give in Fig. 2 the consecutive locations for the\nnorthern hemisphere magnetic footprints of the Cluster or-\nbit from 04:00 UT to the expected magnetopause crossing at\n16:00 UT. For later reference, we mark in Fig. 2 the location\nand extent of the ESR field-aligned and northward pointing\nantenna beams, the scan coverage of the STF radar, and the\nfield-of-views of the SuperDARN radars in the relevant sec-\ntor. In addition, we mark the orbit footprints of the DMSP\nF15 satellite during a passage over Greenland from 13:25 to\n13:31 UT (see Fig. 24 below for the data from that passage).\nIf we want to interpret the detailed ground-based and Clus-\nter data on the background of the prevailing solar wind condi-\ntions, we require as exact as possible knowledge of the direc-\ntion and strength of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nand the solar wind pressure at the sub-solar magnetosphere.\nWith no near-Earth solar wind monitoring satellite available\nfor this study, we had to rely on measurements by the ACE\nsatellite close to the L1 point, which is more than 220 RE\nupstream in the solar wind. Using the fact that the solar\nwind clock angle (the IMF direction in the GSE YZ-plane) is\nmaintained during the passage of the IMF through the Earth\u2019s\nbow shock, we have carried out a cross-correlation between\nthe interplanetary magnetic field angle at ACE and the angle\nof the magnetic field as seen by the Cluster FGM instrument\n \n \n \nFig. 3b. Detailed ACE data, shifted by a time-lag of 75 min as\ndetermined in Fig. 3a, from 12:00 to 14:00 UT on 14 January 2001.\n(From top to bottom: solar wind dynamic pressure, IMF X, Y and\nZ components in GSM coordinates, and IMF clock angle).\nin the magnetosheath after about 15:00 UT (Balogh et al.,\n2001, this issue). In Fig. 3a, we show the excellent agree-\nment of these two data sets by applying a delay of 75 min\nbetween ACE and Cluster when it is in the magnetosheath\nclose to the magnetopause. The delay is very reasonable for\na slow solar wind of 350\u2013390 km\/s, as observed on 14 Jan-\nuary 2001.\nIn Fig. 3b, we show for further reference a more complete\nset of relevant ACE data for the time interval studied below,\nnow shifted by the lag determined in Fig. 3a. We can con-\nclude that neither the solar wind pressure (top panel) nor the\nIMF BZ-component (panel 4) reveal that this period could be\nparticularly interesting for solar wind effects on the magne-\ntosphere ionosphere system. Apart from a short-lived devi-\nation of BZ to small or even slightly negative values, which\nmoves the IMF vector into the equatorial plane (so the clock\nangle is near 90\u25e6, bottom panel), there are no large indi-\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1373\ncations of solar wind forcing at all. The deviations in the\nclock angle are associated with negative excursions of the\nBY -component (panel 3), and the BX-component (panel 2) is\nnegative throughout the interval.\nUsing the inferred time shift of 75 min between the solar\nwind variations seen at ACE and their expected effects on the\ndayside magnetopause, we can easily understand the basic\ncharacteristics of EISCAT ESR and Cluster CIS observations\nduring the entire northern hemisphere orbital portion on 14\nJanuary 2001. In Fig. 4, we show in a multipanel presentation\nthe IMF BZ component seen at ACE with a delay of 75 mins\n(top panel), the electron density as seen by the ESR north-\nward pointing and field-aligned antennas (panels 4 and 5,\nrespectively), and in the bottom panel, magnetospheric ions\nas measured by the CIS experiment on Cluster spacecraft 3\n(Re`me et al., 2001, this issue). The ESR facility and its data\nproducts are described in more detail below. From this figure,\na number of observations can readily be made. During the\nperiod of primarily southward directed IMF from 07:00 to\n11:00 UT, both the field-aligned and northward pointing ESR\nantennas are passed by frequent poleward moving events of\nincreased ionisation. These events, and in particular those\nmarked in Fig. 4 with a red bar, are studied in detail in a\nparallel paper by Lockwood et al. (2001a, this issue), who\ninterprete them as signatures of bursty reconnection at a sub-\nsolar neutral line, which, during this period, must map to a\nlocation south of the ESR. In addition, during this time pe-\nriod, it can be concluded that the Cluster spacecraft passes\nfrom the relatively empty northern magnetospheric lobe into\nthe plasma mantle, where multiple regions of enhanced ion\nfluxes pass the spacecraft (see again Lockwood et al., 2001a,\nthis issue, for a more detailed discussion).\nAt 11:00 UT, the sudden northward turning of the IMF\nleads to a shrinking of the magnetospheric polar cap which\nin turn, results in a fast passage of the Cluster spacecraft\nthrough the poleward contracting field lines connected to the\nLLBL and finally reaching a trapped high-energy ion popula-\ntion, which is typical for the dayside Boundary Plasma Sheet\n(BPS). After 11:00 UT, the Cluster spacecraft remained most\nof the time in the BPS region, with the exception of a\nfew shortlived encounters of the Low Latitude Boundary\nLayer (LLBL) plasma, containing lower energy magnetos-\npeath ions (see arrows in Fig. 4). Again we have chosen to\ndiscuss these multiple encounters of field lines connected to\nthe LLBL by Cluster, and coordinated ground-based obser-\nvations of associated high-latitude features in a parallel paper\n(see Lockwood et al., 2001b, this issue).\nAfter the distinct magnetospheric reorganisation occuring\nat 11:00 UT, even the ionospheric features seen by ESR\nchange in character. The relative absence of electron den-\nsity structures in the data from the field-aligned ESR beam\nimplies that the open-closed field line boundary must have\ncontracted to polewards of the ESR field line, or that the\nreconnection line has shifted in longitude such that newly-\nopened field lines no longer pass over the ESR field line.\nFurthermore, the still surprisingly frequent poleward moving\nevents in the ionisation, as seen along the northward looking\nantenna beam, appear now much slower in their poleward\nvelocity, which is indicative of a decrease in the overall con-\nvection velocity, as expected for weakly northward IMF.\nThe next dramatic event occurs at about 13:30 UT, when\nESR records a series of poleward moving ionisation features\nof a rather different character than any of the previous ones.\nAn initial rather broad poleward moving enhancement of the\nelectron density is followed by a sharp channel of decreased\nionisation, which is directly followed again by quite a narrow\nionisation increase, apparently originating at far lower lati-\ntudes than any of the previous events (see a higher resolution\npresentation of this data in Fig. 13). During this transient\nevent at the ESR location, the CIS instrument (located just\noff the Greenland\u2019s east coast) detects a short-lived but nev-\nertheless complete drop out of the trapped high energy BPS\nplasma simultaneously with large fluxes of magnetosheath\nions, a signature typical of the magnetosperic cusp (Smith\nand Lockwood, 1996). As we will show below, all other in-\nstruments on Cluster see features typical for the magneto-\nspheric cusp at this moment. The nature of this sudden cusp-\nlike activity at 15:00 MLT, i.e. well away from any expected\nnominal cusp location, is the main topic for the following\ncomparative study of Cluster and ground-based data.\nThe final noteworthy observation in Fig. 4 is the exit of\nthe Cluster spacecraft into the magnetosheath at 15:00 UT,\ni.e. about one hour earlier than predicted by the model, using\na standard solar wind parameter set. The ESR observations\nstop at about this time due to a scheduled end of operation.\n2.2 Ground-based observations during the transient cusp\nevent around 13:30 UT\nIn the following section, we will utilise a complete set of\nground-based observations to study the global and meso-\nscale evolution of magnetospheric convection and iono-\nspheric current flow, which consequently leads to the surpris-\ning event of cusp-like plasma seen by Cluster at 15:00 MLT.\nThe most appropriate ground-based tool to provide a global\nview of the instantaneous convection pattern and its dynam-\nical development is the Super-Dual Auroral Radar Network\n(SuperDARN, Greenwald et al., 1995), which now employs\n4 overlapping radar pairs (i.e. 8 radar facilities) in the north-\nern hemisphere, covering the better portion of the northern\npolar cap and auroral zone. In Fig. 5, we show the locations\nand overlapping fields-of-view of these radars. For further\nreference, we also indicate in this figure the locations of key\nmagnetometer stations within the CANOPUS (red squares;\nHughes et al., 1997), Greenland (light-green squares;\nhttp:\/\/web.dmi.dk\/fsweb\/projects\/chain\/greenland.html) and\nIMAGE (blue squares; Viljanen and Ha\u00a8kkinen, 1997) net-\nworks of magnetometers. During the present study, these ar-\nrays of instruments are located in the dawn, noon, and post-\nnoon sector, respectively. The darker green squares indicate\nmagnetometers in the Russian Arctic, which are not used for\nthis particular study. Note, however, that the IMAGE magne-\ntometer network is part of the Scandinavian multi-instrument\nnetwork MIRACLE (Syrja\u00a8suo et al., 1998) which also em-\n1374 H. J.

A similar cover-\nage of radars and other instruments is achieved at southern\nhigh-latitudes (data not used in this study; see Greenwald\net al. (1995), and Opgenoorth and Lockwood (1997) for de-\ntails).\nBy using the line-of-sight velocities of all 8 individual\nradar pairs, it is possible to derive a realistic estimate of the\nglobal convection flow by fitting the observed flow patterns\nto a convection model characteristic for the prevailing solar\nwind conditions (see Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998, for more\ndetails of this method). In Fig. 6 (panels a to h), we show\neight selected instantaneous convection flow patterns as de-\nrived from the data of the northern hemisphere SuperDARN\nradar network, using information about the solar wind from\nthe ACE spacecraft delayed by 75 min. The clock angle and\nintensity of the applied IMF is indicated in the small dial at\nthe top right corner of each image. The original data stems\nfrom radar scans of 2 min in duration, which determines the\ntime resolution of these global flow patterns. The velocities\nshown range from 0 to 1000 m\/s, according to a colour scale\nin the top left corner of each image.\nFrom these images, we see that at 13:22:24 UT the throat\nof the dayside two-cell convection pattern, the most likely\nposition of the magnetospheric cusp, was located at a pre-\nnoon position over eastern Canada. Northern Greenland and\nthe polar cap north of Svalbard are covered by a broad region\nof anti-sunward convection, representing the poleward part\nof the evening sector convection cell. The nightside portion\nof the morning sector convection cell is located over north-\nern Canada and Alaska. Generally, the auroral oval is con-\ntracted, as could be expected for a northward IMF condition.\nTwo min later, at 13:24:26, a new region of northeastward di-\nrected flow appears at the nominal cusp location. However,\nwe would like to point out that a very small indication of this\nnew flow is already visible in the first image.\nIn the following panels (13:26:28, 13:30:32, and\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1375\n   \nFig. 5. Northern hemisphere map illustrating the coverage of Su-\nperDARN and magnetometer networks used in this study (see text\nfor details). The shaded area is the field-of-view of a radar under\nconstruction.\n13:32:34 UT), it can be seen how the new flow-channel\ngrows, and finally connects the morning sector auroral oval\nflow over Canada across the north of Greenland to the post-\nnoon polar cap flow north of the ESR. At 13:34:36 UT it is\ncontinuous from eastern Canada to the Arctic Ocean, north\nof Svalbard, and a strong westward flow-channel develops\nin the post-noon auroral zone, just to the north of mainland\nScandinavia and the northern part of Greenland. Even the\neastward directed auroral zone flows over mainland Canada\nand Alaska are considerably enhanced by this time. The new\nflow pattern has by now resulted in a peculiar narrow exten-\nsion of the dusk sector convection cell, which appears very\nmuch like a superposition of a new shear-flow pattern on the\nstandard quiet-time convection pattern.\nTo illustrate the nature of this new intense flow regime,\nwe leave Fig. 6 for a while, and show in Fig. 7a the distribu-\ntion of Joule heating in the northern hemisphere as calculated\nwith the help of the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric\nElectrodynamics (AMIE, Richmond, 1992; Lu et al., 1997)\nand in Fig. 7b, the distribution of field-aligned currents at two\nselected times, namely 13:30 and 13:35 UT. For this study,\nthe AMIE input consisted of data from all the SuperDARN\nand EISCAR ESR line-of-sight velocities, 4 DMSP satellites\n(both ion drifts and particles), 4 NOAA satellites (particle\ndata only), and 94 ground-based magnetometers. AMIE pa-\nrameter maps were derived with 5 min resolution. The first\npanel of Fig. 7a illustrates the character of the initial long\nflow-channel across the dayside portions of the two earlier\nconvection cells at 13:30 UT. Only 5 min later, at 13:35 UT,\ndoes a second heat- (i.e. flow-) channel develop as an auro-\nral oval return flow. As seen from the SuperDARN data in\nFig. 6, its direction is westward and it lies at lower latitudes.\nThe same temporal sequence is apparent from the field-\naligned current distribution in Fig. 7b; at 13:30 UT, an ini-\ntial new pair of field-aligned current sheets appears superim-\nposed on the weak standard Region I and II currents. The\ncurrent is directed downward at the poleward side and up-\nward at the equatorward side, in order to imbed an east-\nward directed flow-channel and a westward directed iono-\nspheric current flow (see also magnetometer data in Fig. 9).\nAt 13:35 UT, this field-aligned current pair is more concen-\ntrated at higher latitudes, and a third, downward current sheet\nhas developed equatorwards of the westward flow (eastward\nionospheric current)in the post-noon auroral zone.\nReturning to Fig. 6, the SuperDARN data shows that after\nthe maximum phase of the transient event at 13:34:36 UT, the\neastward directed portion of the new convection channel, i.e.\nthe polar cap part, decays somewhat earlier than the west-\nward directed auroral zone flow. After about 13:50 UT, the\nglobal convection has returned to a more normal undistorted\n2-cell pattern now exhibiting again a clear convection throat\nover eastern Canada.\nWe are well aware of the fact that the data presented in\nFig. 6 is quite strongly based on several model assumptions\nand represents only a best fit restricted by many individual\nline-of-sight velocity observations and a model convection\npattern (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998). In order to illustrate\nthat the observations described above are a true pattern seen\neven in the combined vector maps of individual radar pairs,\nwe show in Fig. 8 data from the Goose Bay \/ Iceland West\n(Stockseyri) DARN radar pair. In these spatially limited, but\nmore directly derived vector maps over Greenland, the ear-\nlier noted development and decay of a short-lived eastward\n(red vectors) convection flow-channel followed by the later\ndevelopment and decay of a westward (blue vectors) convec-\ntion flow-channel becomes even more evident. Thus, we con-\nclude that the data from direct bistatic vector measurements\nstrongly support the content of the global convection maps\nderived by the method of Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998).\nHowever, the EISCAT data in Fig. 4 clearly indicates a\npoleward progression of the new electron density feature at\n13:30 UT, something that is not quite apparent from these\ntime integrated vector maps and the AMIE model results.\nIn order to further investigate whether SuperDARN data\ncan support these ESR observations, we have inspected data\nalong individual beams of the SuperDARN radars in search\nof poleward moving signatures (data not shown here). With\nvarying clarity but nevertheless consistently observed in all\n5 radars, a new regime of anti-sunward flow (away from the\nradars) was observed after 13:30 UT, which progressed pole-\nward with time until about 14:00 UT.\nThere is, however, yet another and possibly even more re-\nliable way of investigating flow enhancement events in the\nhigh-latitude dayside ionosphere. As already mentioned in\nthe discussion above, intense flow-channel events are as-\nsociated with field-aligned currents, electric fields, and last\nbut not least, the precipitation of magnetospheric or magne-\n1376 H.

Therefore, it\nis obvious that these flow-channels must be associated with\nionospheric currents, which in the case of predominant Hall\ncurrent flow, will be detectable by magnetometer networks\nas current channels, but with opposite directions, as com-\npared to the flow-channels observed by the radars (Stauning,\n1995). Indeed, by inspecting magnetic records from high-\nlatitude stations within the CANOPUS Churchill line, the\nGreenland westcoast line and the IMAGE central meridian\nfrom Svalbard to southern Finland, we find that all stations\naround 13:30 UT are under the influence of alternating east-\nward and westward current flows (original magnetogram data\nnot shown here). In these magnetograms, we find a distinct\nphase-shift of the peak disturbances with higher and higher\nlatitudes, indicating a poleward progression of the associated\ncurrent patterns, which we would like to illustrate in more\ndetail.\nIn Fig. 9, we display the magnetic X-disturbance mea-\nsured at the three meridional lines of magnetometers in a\ncolour-coded latitude versus time plot. Red areas indicate\neastward current flow and blue (or green) areas indicate west-\nward current flow. Following Stauning (1995), we assume\nthat ionospheric Hall currents are the main contributors to\ndayside high-latitude magnetic disturbances. We find that\nthe blue-green areas are westward currents within the initial\neastward flow seen by the radars, while the red areas would\ncorrespond to the later development of primarily westward\nconvection flow at lower latitudes. It is striking how well\nthese independent magnetic observations support the radar\nobservations discussed above, but now with the addition of\n1378 H. J.

The central panel of Fig. 9 corre-\nsponds to a meridian only slightly east of the nominal cusp\nlocation where we saw the first appearance of eastward flow\nin radar data shortly after 13:20 UT. In addition from this\ndata, we see that a new region of westward current flow (east-\nward convection flow) appears just after 13:20 UT. It expands\nfirst equatorward, but after a few minutes, it expands pole-\nward with a velocity of about 1.5 km\/s. Not as clear, but\nin a similar manner, an initial equatorward erosion of pre-\nexisting eastward current flow and later a poleward progres-\nsion of westward current flow is seen in the CANOPUS data\n(top panel). In the Scandinavian IMAGE data, the lack of\nstations between Svalbard and mainland Scandinavia (with\nthe exception of Bjo\u00a8rno\u00a8ya, BJN) gives insufficient data cov-\nerage at the relevant latitude. At 13:30 UT, all three meridian\nchains record the poleward motion of an eastward current\nchannel (westward flow) which is located equatorward of the\nfirst current. The Greenland data show that this poleward ex-\npansion ceases at about 13:40 UT, reaching a northernmost\ninvariant latitude of 80\u25e6. This observed ionospheric current\npattern was of course one of the inputs to the AMIE results,\nyielding the derivation of a triple field-aligned current struc-\nture, downward at the poleward and equatorward edges, and\nupwardly directed in its central portion.\nThe SAMNET magnetometer network (Yeoman et al.,\n1990) consists of stations at both auroral and subauroral lat-\nitudes in the Iceland-UK-Scandinavian sector (see Fig. 10a\nfor a map of SAMNET stations). In particular, data from\nthe subauroral longitudinal line of stations is helpful in\nidentifying the temporal and spatial development of high-\nlatitude phenomena. The distant effects of three-dimensional\nsubstorm current wedges and other auroral zone features\nassociated with localised field-aligned current flow create\ncharacteristic magnetic disturbances at subauroral latitudes.\nIn Fig. 10b, we show the deflections in the magnetic H -\ncomponents during the key interval from 13:00\u201314:00 UT.\nAt the westernmost stations (HLL, FAR, GML, YOR) al-\nmost independent of latitude, a positive deflection of the H -\ncomponent starts to develop just before 13:20 UT, when the\nfirst indications of a new flow-channel in the SuperDARN\nH.

This initial disturbance declines\nafter 13:28 UT, reaches a minimum at about 13:32 UT, and\nis followed by a return to positive values by 13:40 UT. Along\nboth sub-auroral longitudinal chains FAR-NOR-OUL and\nGMI-KVI-NUR-BOR, this initial bipolar feature in the mag-\nnetic H disturbance is seen to propagate eastwards at a rela-\ntively high velocity (1300 km in about 3 min, corresponding\nto about 7 km\/s). Similar high longitudinal motions of the\nconvection throat during IMFBY changes have been reported\nearlier by Greenwald et al. (1995). Along both longitudinal\nchains, the depth of the negative disturbance increases to-\nwards the east, indicating a later growth of this disturbance.\nThe propagation of the feature clearly terminates at a longi-\ntude slightly east of NUR, since there is basically no time\nshift between NUR and BOR.\nEven though this data confirms nicely the fast eastward\npropagation of a transient high-latitude event, its interpreta-\ntion in terms of field-aligned current effects is very difficult.\nWe have seen from the AMIE data that the new flow-channel\nis imbedded between two field-aligned current sheets, ex-\npanding towards the east, with the additional complication\nof the delayed formation (probably not expansion) of a more\nequatorward located downward directed current. It is clear\nthat SAMNET must record the effects of this complicated\ndevelopment, but further conclusions will require a more de-\ntailed model analysis of the data, which is beyond the scope\nof this paper.\nFrom Fig. 2, it becomes evident that at 13:30 UT both\nthe US incoherent scatter radar at So\u00a8ndre Stro\u00a8mfjord (STF,\nKelly et al., 1995) and the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR,\nMcCrea and Lockwood, 1997) were in excellent locations to\nprovide detailed observations of the different phases of the\ntransient flow event. During this event, the STF radar was\noperated in a special mode, designed for coordinated ob-\nservations with the ESR in conjunction with Cluster. This\nmode consists of an azimuthal scan at constant low eleva-\ntion towards the northeast of the radar. In the top panel of\nFig. 11, we display an overview presentation of the mea-\nsured line-of-sight velocities during the entire period in ques-\ntion, together with more detailed line-of-sight velocities (left\n1380 H.

Map of stations in the SAMNET sub-auroral magnetome-\nter array.\n3 panels) and associated ion temperatures (right 3 panels)\nfrom three consecutive scans during the key interval from\n13:28 to 13:39 UT. The scan duration is slightly more than\n4 min and the scans are continuous, i. e. a scan towards\nlower latitudes (top two panels) is directly followed by a re-\nturn scan towards higher latitudes (central two panels), and\nthen equatorward again (bottom two panels). More infor-\nmation on this special mode of operation can be found at\nhttp:\/\/isr.sri.com\/iono\/cluster\/cluster experiments.html.\nAlready in the relatively coarse overview data in the top\npanel of Fig. 11, one can clearly identify the short-lived event\nof anti-sunward flow shortly after 13:30 UT (blue = away\nfrom the radar), which we have identified in all other data\nsets so far. Note that even though the axis is labelled as alti-\ntude, the main effects along that axis will be due to latitude\nvariations, as the beam is pointed towards north and north-\neast at a low elevation. The detailed scans shown in the left\nlower panels of Fig. 11 illustrate that the flow event is re-\nstricted to the north-pointing directions of the scans, and that\nit is indeed very short-lived at this location. Some initial in-\ndications may be found in the first scan starting at 13:28 UT,\nand the flow-channel is fully developed when the second scan\nreaches this position again at 13:35 UT (i.e. close to the end\ntime of this poleward turning azimuthal scan). The next re-\nturn scan, passing that same region at 13:37 UT, already sees\na clear decay. The same feature becomes visible in the right\nlower panels of Fig. 11, displaying the ion temperature along\nthe radar beam. It is well-known from numerous incoherent\nscatter radar studies that short-lived flow enhancements have\na pronounced effect on the temperature of the ionospheric\nion population through the drastically increased ion neutral\ncollisional heating. In the ion temperature data it is clear that\nnot only the transient nature of the event stands out, but also\ncomparing the lower two panels to the right, its poleward\nmotion can be seen.\nFig. 10b. Horizontal component magnetograms from the SAMNET\nnetwork, sorted from top to bottom along three longitudinal profiles\nat different latitudes (HLL\u2013KIL, FAR\u2013OUL, and GML\u2013BOR).\nThis portion of the scan area of the STF radar was about\n45\u25e6 in longitude to the west of the nominal Cluster footprint\nat that particular time, and about 30\u25e6 to the east of the lo-\ncation of the initial flow-channel, as seen by SuperDARN\nover Canada at 13:20 UT. At the same time, the northward\npointing antenna beam of the ESR is only 15\u25e6 to the east and\nprobably a few degrees to the north of the Cluster footprint\n(see Fig. 2, and discussion below). A spatial and temporal\nconnection between the observations at these two key radar\nsystems is provided by a Norwegian all-sky imager, located\nin Ny A\u02dalesund. This camera is sensitive to red auroral emis-\nsions of 630.0 nm. In Fig. 12, we show three selected images\nof red-line aurora, projected onto a map with the assumption\nof a central emission at an altitude of 250 km. A more detail\ndiscussion of this optical data with respect to selected Clus-\nter and low altitude satellite data is presented by Moen et\nal. (2001, this issue). The auroral data nicely illustrate how\nthe features which were observed in the STF scan around\n13:35 UT expand primarily eastward, but even slightly pole-\nward, past the nominal location of the Cluster footprint at\nH.

The relevant portion of the\nprojected Cluster orbit is indicated in the images (see time marks in the first image).\n13:34 UT and into the vicinity of Svalbard at about 13:38 UT.\nBy comparing the first and second images in Fig. 12, one re-\nalises that Cluster should have been affected by the auroral\nexpansion at about 13:30\u201313:34 UT (see Moen et al., 2001,\nthis issue, for more auroral images and also the following\ndiscussion in Sect. 2.3 for detailed Cluster data). The ESR\nshould see the first effects somewhat delayed, i.e. after about\n13:40 UT (see last image at 13:38 UT and the discussion be-\nlow).\nDetailed ESR data of electron density (the same data as in\nFig. 4, top panel, but with a higher resolution) and ion tem-\nperature (the latter as a proxy of enhanced ionospheric flow)\nare presented in Fig. 13. In this data, the poleward moving\ncharacter of the transient flow event is again obvious. The\nsharpest feature seen by the ESR is a poleward propagating\ndepletion of the electron density (blue area at 13:40 UT in the\ntop panel), coinciding with a region of enhanced ion temper-\natures, indicating enhanced plasma flow velocity (red\/yellow\narea in the second panel). In the full set of ESR data (data\nnot shown here), one can see that the ion flow direction in\nthis channel of higher temperature is clearly away from the\nradar. We conclude that this sharp feature must be charac-\nteristic for the flow-channel itself. It is directly followed by\nan adjacent propagating region of enhanced ionisation (red\nnarrow structure around 13:50 UT), originating at notably a\nlower latitude than any other electron density feature seen by\nthe ESR during the entire Cluster passage (see also Fig. 4).\nWe believe that it is created by new and more energetic pre-\ncipitation, therefore affecting a lower altitude portion of the\nobliquely northward pointing ESR beam. In order to support\nthis conclusion, we present in the bottom panel of Fig. 13\nan optical keogram from the Italian all-sky camera (ITACA)\nat Ny A\u02dalesund (i.e. 557.7 nm emissions along a meridional\nprofile plotted versus latitude and time with the assumption\nof a central emission altitude at 110 km). ITACA is part of\nthe MIRACLE network. The heavy black line in the bot-\ntom panel of Fig. 13 corresponds to the lowest latitude in the\ndata from the ESR oblique beam. By continuing the slope\nof the poleward propagating auroral forms in the keogram to\nthat particular latitude (thin lines), one can readily associate\nthe main flow-channel in the ESR data with a region void\nof auroral emissions (label 1). The channel of precipitation\nat 13:50 UT is associated with discrete 557.7 nm aurora (la-\nbel 2). The fact that the aurora is green, i.e. resulting from\nparticle precipition to altitudes of 110\u2013130 km, explains the\nESR observations of increased electron densities at lower al-\ntitudes. Apart from this main event, the existence of a sec-\nond pair of events is revealed in the combined presentation\nin Fig. 13. A weaker flow-channel (as recognised by the cav-\nity in ne, enhanced Ti and a region void of aurora (label 3))\nexhibiting only limited poleward expansion is followed by a\nregion of enhanced precipitation and auroral emissions (la-\nbel 4). This second sequence of events is actually apparent\nin detailed Cluster data as well and will be discussed below\nin more detail.\nIn finishing this comprehensive discussion of ground-\nbased data sets, we note that the clear poleward mov-\ning events start at the lowest ranges of the radar at about\n13:40 UT, i. e. somewhat after the onset of the poleward mo-\ntion of currents and radar-echoes seen by other ground-based\ninstruments (see Fig. 9) and the sudden onset of cusp-like\nprecipitation in the Cluster data (Fig. 4 and discussion be-\nlow). Furthermore, we note that the poleward velocity of\nabout 0.5 km\/s derived for the flow-channel and the adjacent\nregion of enhanced electron density events seen by the ESR\nis much slower than the poleward velocity of about 1.5 km\/s\nderived for the magnetic features seen at latitudes of the IM-\nAGE chain between 13:30 and 13:40 UT.\nIn order to associate the features seen by the ESR radar\nwith the magnetic features monitored by the IMAGE chain\nof magnetometers, we present the two data sets in a com-\nbined stacked plot in Fig. 14.

The\nheavy black line in the keogram marks\nthe lowest latitude in the ESR data, and\nthe thin arrows are guidelines to con-\nnect the regions void or filled with au-\nrora to corresponding regions of low\nand high electron density (respectively,\nhigh and low ion temperature) in the\nESR data.\nneeds to keep in mind that the lowest latitude data in the pole-\nward pointing ESR beam (77.9\u25e6 Inv. Lat. in the top panel)\nis about 200 km to the north of the highest latitude data in\nthe IMAGE chain (76.7\u25e6 Inv. Lat. in the bottom panel). The\ninsert of Cluster CIS data in the central panel should be ig-\nnored for the time being, as it will be discussed in Sect. 2.3\nbelow. Slanted and vertical lines in this stacked presentation\nare meant to assist the eye in connecting the key features of\nthe various data. Obviously, the initial broad and fluctuating\neastward current is associated with a similarly broad region\nof enhanced (and fluctuating) electron density in the ESR\ndata. In correspondence to the earlier comparisons of coher-\nent radar and magnetometer observations the flow-channel at\nESR (decreased ne) was associated at that time with a nar-\nrow region of westward current flow in the IMAGE data and\na main precipitation region (enhanced ne) with a new narrow\neastward current, etc. for the second set of transients.\nA comparison of Fig. 14 with Fig. 9 increases the con-\nfidence in this interpretation of physically associated fea-\ntures. Both in Canada and over Greenland, the initially\nfast poleward expansion of transient current channels around\n13:30 UT decreased considerably after reaching about 80\u25e6\ninvariant latitude. In Fig. 14, this latitudinal boundary is lo-\ncated just poleward of the IMAGE chain, but right in the\nvicinity of the northward pointing ESR radar beam. Thus,\nthe difference in the observed poleward velocity in the IM-\nAGE and ESR data is explained by a global pattern that is\nnot visible in the individual data sets. However, the observed\nfeatures match very well.\nIn this section, we have presented data from a large net-\nwork of ground-based stations to infer the dynamics of the\nionospheric convection and several associated transient fea-\n1384 H.

In summary, we can state\nthat a new eastward directed flow-channel, originating over\nCanada at about 13:20 UT, expanded during the following\n20 min both eastwards and polewards, and finally reached the\nlatitude and longitude of Svalbard at 13:35 UT. The change\nin the global pattern is best recognised in the data of the Su-\nperDARN network, supported by the AMIE model. In more\ndetail, the poleward motion of this eastward directed flow-\nchannel was clearly detected in meridionally directed radar\nbeams or individual magnetometer chains, and the eastward\nmotion was confirmed not only by the use of data along sev-\neral meridians, but also by an additional well positioned all-\nsky camera and lower-latitude magnetometers. From the en-\ntity of these data sets we conclude that the predicted footprint\nof the Cluster satellites was engulfed by the leading north-\neastern edge of this new expanding flow-channel at about\n13:30 UT. During the following interval of 20\u201330 min, Clus-\nter remained to the west of Svalbard, at a comparable mag-\nnetic latitude with a fair possiblity to observe transient con-\nvection changes a few minutes before they affected the Sval-\nbard region.\nH.

Figure 14, shows the ESR (top panel) and CIS\ndata (central panel), at much higher time resolutions than\nFig. 4, concentrating on the hour of interest between 13:00\nand 14:00 UT. In order to bridge the latitudinal gap between\nthe ESR data and Cluster (just as the all-sky camera data\nin Fig. 13 bridged the gap between Greenland, Cluster, and\nSvalbard) we add in the bottom panel once more the data\nfrom the IMAGE magnetometer chain. With the aid of ver-\ntical lines, Fig. 14 illustrates that during the time interval\nfrom 13:30 to 13:50 UT, Cluster must have been passed al-\nmost simultaneously by the same structures of convection\nand precipitation, which passed over the magnetometers at\nthe latitude of Svalbard. With a delay of the order of 10 min,\nthe same structures are seen to propagate into the northward\nlooking ESR radar beam where they are observed to continue\ntheir propagation towards about 80\u25e6 invariant latitude (see\ndetailed discussion above). The combined data also clearly\nshows that the main cusp-like features in the CIS data are as-\nsociated with the first arrival of the eastward flow-channel.\nHowever, a careful inspection of the combined data reveals\nfine structure in the ion data, which might be associated with\na second, but minor surge of cusp-like features at around\n13:40 to 13:45 UT. As in the main event, its ionospheric\nfeatures are a decrease in eastward current flow (westward\nelectrojet or enhanced eastward plasma flow) and a depletion\nin electron density, which is indicative of a flow-channel (see\nalso a clear second enhancement of Ti in Fig. 13 at that time).\nMore detailed CIS data from spacecraft 3 in Fig. 15 shows\nthe three-component H+ velocities (top panel), the pitch-\nangle distribution of trapped magnetospheric ions in the\nenergy range of 3.8\u201330 keV (central panel) and the stan-\ndard total ion flux for reference (bottom panel). The cen-\ntral panel illustrates in more detail the complete drop out\nof magnetosheric particles at the time of arrival of the\neastward flow-channel. The second partial drop out from\n13:40:46 UT is also clearly contrasted from the time inter-\nvals of 13:33:40 UT and 13:46:56 UT, when the CIS in-\nstrument observes a mixture of magnetosheath and (some-\nwhat depleted) magnetospheric ions. This must mean that\nthe satellites are after the main event located in the magneto-\nspheric boundary layer adjacent to the main body of the tran-\nsient structure. The velocity data in the top panel show that\nCIS, probably as early as 13:26 UT, has entered the vicinity\nof the cusp region, detecting an enhanced, transient flow in\nanti-sunward direction. The curves indicate a flow primarily\nin the \u2212X (i. e. earthward) and +Y (i.e. eastward) direc-\ntion with a bulk flow velocity of up to 200 km\/s. This flow\nevent is observed until 13:37 UT, and is in agreement with\nthe ground-based observation in the vicinity of the Cluster\nfootprint.

Even though we note that it is very dif-\nficult to map velocities from the magnetopause to the iono-\nsphere along very distorted field lines, it is, nevertheless, in-\nteresting to note that this anti-sunward, duskward flow would\ncorrespond to an ionospheric convective flow of the order of\n\u2264 1 km\/s, primarily eastward in direction, but with a clear\npoleward component.\nSo far we have presented Cluster data from only one satel-\nlite. The use of the full multi-satellite concept of Cluster\nshould allow us to further understand the observed features\nas effects of a localised propagating magnetospheric struc-\nture. In Fig. 16, we show H+ ion flux data from all three CIS\ninstruments for the time interval from 13:00 to 14:20 UT (as\ndescribed in more detail by Re`me et al. (2001, this issue), the\nCIS experiment on spacecraft 2 suffers from a partial mal-\nfunction). In this resolution, the ion data of spacecraft 1 and\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1387\n3 appear almost identical, while clearly spacecraft 4 is en-\ngulfed in a much lower particle flux, arriving after a discern-\nable delay. Nevertheless, all three satellites exhibit the dis-\ncussed transient signatures of one complete (at 13:30:33 UT)\nand one partial (at 13:40:45 UT) drop out in the trapped ion\npopulation in conjunction with the arrival of magnetosheath-\nlike plasma with energies of up to a few 100 eV.\nIn order to understand the differences in arrival time and\nthe relative strength of the features in the CIS and other Clus-\nter data, we need to know the location of the 4 satellites\nwith respect to each other and in relation to the propaga-\ntion directions inferred from the ground-based data. Fig. 17\nshows the configuration of the Cluster spacecraft along a\nbundle of magnetic field lines originating from slightly east\nof Greenland, i. e. the satellite location at 13:30 UT. The top\npanel of Fig. 17 was produced using the Orbit Visualisation\nTool (OVT, Stasievicz et al., 1992), and the colours \u201cred\u201d,\n\u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d, and \u201cmagenta\u201d correspond to space-\ncraft 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Referring to the discus-\nsion about the CIS multi-spacecraft data in Fig. 16 above,\nwe can conclude that the central satellites of this configura-\ntion (spacecraft 1 and 3) are the ones which are fully affected\nby the transient precipitation. Spacecraft 4, which is located\non a more poleward field line, appears to not be fully en-\ngulfed in this localised feature. To study this effect further,\nwe present in the lower left panel of Fig. 17 a high resolution\nplot of the GSE X-component of the electric field from all\n4 spacecraft for a pronounced transient feature at 13:30 UT.\nThese electric field measurements are provided by the Clus-\nter Electric Field and Wave experiment (EFW, Gustafsson et\nal., 2001; Andre\u00b4 et al., 2001, both this issue). Figures 17a and\nb use the same colour scheme as OVT for the electric field\ncurves. It is easily concluded that the satellites are hit by this\ntransient feature in the following sequence of spacecraft 2, 1,\n3, and 4. Again, spacecraft 4 generally shows slightly dif-\nferent patterns than the other 3 spacecraft. A best fit time-\nshift analysis of the four curves results in the alignment dis-\nplayed in the lower right panel of Fig. 17. From the applied\nshifts, one can calculate a resulting propagation velocity of\nthe transient feature, v(x, y, z) = (\u221284,\u22126,\u221238) km\/s.\nConsidering the location of the satellites on the post-noon\nflank of the magnetosphere, a propagation primarily in the\nGSE\u2013X-direction would be in agreement with the observed\neastward, but also poleward motion of the feature on the\nionospheric level. However, we would like to point out two\ncaveats concerning detailed interpretations of this kind. First,\nwe note that at this early stage of the Cluster data analy-\nsis, the exact amplitudes of electric field-components are not\ncompletely verified, and second, one should be careful in in-\nterpreting the relative arrival time of such extremely transient\nfeatures at the satellite configuration. Similar sub-features\nhave been seen to exhibit, with respect to the bulk motion,\nboth backward and forward directed passages of the Cluster\nconstellation. With this in mind, we should look out for more\ngeneral gradients and their relative arrival time in other data\nat the various Cluster spacecraft.\nA good candidate for the observation of more general\ntrends is the local plasma density as derived from measure-\nments of the plasma-frequency by the WHISPER experi-\nments on Cluster (Decreau et al., 2001, this issue). Fig. 18\nshows the plasma density at all 4 spacecraft during the 30 min\nof interest for this study, using the standard Cluster colour-\ncode, spacecraft 1 (black), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (ma-\ngenta). Clearly the arrival of the cusp particles results in\na short-lived enhancement of the plasma-density between\n13:29 and 13:34 UT. Even the second event is recognisable\nas a less pronounced increase in the plasma density. From the\nblowup insert in the top left corner it can be seen that while\nseveral sub-events can have different relative arrival times at\nthe spacecraft, the main trend in the plasma density, neverthe-\nless, arrives in the same sequence as discussed above, namely\nred, black, green, magenta, corresponding to spacecraft 2, 1,\n3, 4.\nData from the magnetic field instruments (FGM, Balogh\net al., 2001, this issue) on all four satellites from 13:20 to\n13:50 UT are presented in Fig. 19. The data are shown as\nthree components in the GSE coordinate system. Several\ncharacteristic features can be recognised. At first, we note\nthat the total magnetic field (see also Fig. 20) increases dur-\ning the transient cusp encounter, while one normally would\nexpect to observe a decrease in the outer cusp or magne-\ntosheath region. The largest magnetic variations of about\n25 nT are associated with the arrival and \u201cdecay\u201d of the tran-\nsient cusp encounter at 13:30 UT. They are primarily in the\nnegative BX-component (somewhat less in the positive BZ-\ncomponent) which could indicate the effect of localised field-\naligned currents (see more detailed discussion in Section 3\nbelow). Furthermore, a careful inspection of the most dra-\nmatic transient features in the BX-component at 13:30 UT\nreveals the same \u201chit-sequence\u201d of spacecraft 2, 1, 3, and 4\nby the magnetic transient, which is in good agreement with\nthe observations of EFW, Whisper and CIS.\nSince we would like to understand the physical meaning of\nthe observed variations in time and space, and the behaviour\nof the vector quantities with respect to the geometry of the\nfeature itself, we have chosen a somewhat different presen-\ntation for data only from spacecraft 3 in Fig. 20. In the top\npanel, we plot for comparative inspection two selected en-\nergy channels of the Cluster electron instrument (PEACE,\nOwen et al., 2001, this issue). We use a red curve for the\nhigh energy trapped electrons and a black curve for the low\nenergy magnetosheath electrons (see also Fig. 21 for a more\ncomplete presentation of PEACE data for this event). In the\ncentral panel, we plot the total electric field from EFW (red\ncurve), and the total magnetic field from FGM (black curve).\nIn the bottom two panels, we use our rough knowledge about\nthe velocity and direction of the propagating feature to trans-\nform the temporal sequence of observations of vector com-\nponents of E and B into spatial vectors along the path of\nthe structure. We use GSE coordinates with an arbitrary ori-\ngin at the satellite location, slightly before the encounter of\nthe structure. This means that in these panels, time in the\nsatellite frame runs from the top left to the bottom right. For\nfurther clarification of the lower right vector presentation, we\n1388 H. J.

From this rather complicated but instructive figure, we\ncan readily conclude a number of observations:\n\u2013 As seen in the CIS ion data above, all parameters dis-\nplay an event with either a drop out, increase, or change\nin direction of field quantities at 13:30 UT. This is the\ntime that we identified as the most probable encounter\nof Cluster with a propagating magnetospheric feature\nbased on the combined ground-based data. This event\nis marked with a black line labelled \u201cMagnetic Twist\u201d;\n\u2013 The main effect on both the electric and magnetic field\nat 13:30 UT is not a shear, but rather an intensification\nand twist of the vectors in the direction of motion of the\nfeature, i.e. towards the satellites;\n\u2013 We note that the observed effect at this time is weakest\nin the electric field data;\n\u2013 The feature is clearly a transient as it is observed for\nonly 2\u20133 min by all instruments;\n\u2013 However, there are also clear and simultaneous observa-\ntions of precursors. At 13:26 UT, marked with the first\nblack line (labelled \u201cElectric Shear\u201d) the electric field\nbegins to intensify simultaneously with the CIS obser-\nvations of increased plasma flow velocity. The bottom\nleft panel illustrates that this intensification is clearly\nsheared with respect to the previous field direction be-\nfore 13:25 UT;\n\u2013 At about 13:25 UT, i. e. just before the increase and\nshear in the electric field, the high energy trapped par-\nticles are observed to drop out and reach a minimum at\nthe time of the main event at 13:30 UT;\nFig. 19. Three component magnetic field data in GSE-coordinates\nfrom 13:20 to 13:50 UT from the Cluster FGM experiments on all\n4 spacecraft. The color-coding is again standard Cluster, but here\nusing blue instead of magenta for spacecraft 4.\n\u2013 Both the magnetic field and the magnetosheath-like\nelectron flux (the same is actually true for the magne-\ntosheath ion fluxes in the CIS data above) rise somewhat\nalready at 13:25:26 UT, and remain on this partially en-\nhanced level until after 13:40 UT;\n\u2013 We note that the only observation which is not in agree-\nment with traditional cusp observations is the rise in the\nmagnetic field, which should display a decrease in the\nouter cusp (see discussion below).\nIn Fig. 21, we show more detailed data from the PEACE\ninstrument. In the top panel, we display data from the high\nenergy instrument (HEEA) on only one spacecraft, as there\nare no discernable differences in the HEEA data from the\nother 3 spacecraft. The other panels show data from the low\nenergy instrument on all 4 spacecraft (LEEA; Panels 2\u20135).\nThe two main events in the electric field (shear at 13:26 UT)\nand magnetic field (twist at 13:30 UT) are marked with ver-\ntical arrows. In this presentation, the drop out of the trapped\nelectrons in association with the electric field variations is\nmore pronounced than in the previous figure. It is also obvi-\nous that the first magnetosheath-like particles arrive shortly\nafter this preceding event in the electric field, even though\nthe bulk electron plasma arrives together with the ions at a\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1389\nwell-defined onset at 13:30 UT, lasting for not more than\n2\u20133 min. In addition, the most complete drop out of high\nenergy trapped particles lasts only for this short period of\ntime. The second smaller event at 13:40:44 UT, which we\nidentified above in the ESR, IMAGE and CIS data, is also\nclearly recognisable in the PEACE data of all spacecraft.\nHowever, just as in the ion data, there is considerable fine\nstructure between and around both of the main events, when\nvarying fluxes of trapped electron populations are observed.\nFurthermore, this is confirmed (T. Fritz, personal commu-\nnication) by data from the high energy electron instrument\non Cluster, RAPID (Wilken et al., 2001, this issue, data not\nshown here). A careful inspection of the arrival times for the\nbulk magnetosheath electrons in even higher resolution data\n(not visible in Fig. 21) displays the same temporal sequence\nthat was found for all other instruments. Again, spacecraft 4\nencounters lower fluxes and fewer structures than the other\n3 spacecraft.\nAs a last example of coordinated Cluster measurements,\nwe present in Fig. 22 data from the high-frequency wave ex-\nperiment (STAFF, Rezeau et al., 2001 this issue) during the\ninterval of 13:20 to 14:05 UT. The top panel contains elec-\ntric field wave spectra from 8 Hz to 4 kHz, and the central\nand bottom panels contain magnetic field wave spectra in the\nranges of 8 Hz to 4 kHz and 0\u201310 Hz, respectively. Just as in\nthe DC electric and magnetic field data in Fig. 20, the start\nof the event exhibits two key times. At 13:26 UT, the electric\nfield wave activity increases gradually until the main event at\n13:30 UT, when it increases in a second marked step. Both\ndisplayed frequency ranges of the magnetic wave data record\na sharp increase of broad band waves at 13:30 UT, simulta-\nneously with the main DC B increase.\nIn contrast to all the previous particle and field data,\nSTAFF data resolves a clear structure in the main event, with\nonly a transient decrease in both magnetic and electric field\nwave activity at 13:33 UT, the end time of the transient parti-\ncle event. In general, the wave data displays a longer lasting\nactivity during the initial event and the second smaller parti-\ncle event is not clearly recognizable. The overall duration of\na variable activity pattern between 13:25 and 13:57 is, how-\never, identical with the particle data.\n3 Discussion\nThe rich set of ground-based observations presented above is\nbest explained by a sudden onset of enhanced pre-noon, but\nsubsolar reconnection, which must have taken place some-\ntime around 13:20 UT, as the first signatures of enhanced\neastward flow are seen at that time by the global Super-\nDARN network (Fig. 6). First observations of equatorward\nexpanding westward current, typically associated with east-\nward flow (Stauning, 1995) are made by the Greenland mag-\nnetometer array at the same time (Fig. 9). From Figs. 3b\nand 4, it becomes obvious, however, that this reconnection\npulse occurred during a period of extended northward IMF\nBZ , generally positive BY , and negative BX. The only pos-\nsible trigger event in the solar wind for the dramatic events\ndescribed above is a minor excursion of BZ towards small\nvalues which, together with a negative excursion of BY ,\nleads to a rotation of the IMF clock angle into the equatorial\nplane between 13:05 and 13:12 UT. According to Lockwood\net al. (2000) and McCrea et al. (2000, see also references\ntherein), such a configuration can allow for the occurrence\nof subsolar (BZ southern type) reconnection in the northern\nhemisphere pre-noon region.\nIn order to illustrate the magnetic field geometry which\nmay give rise to such a reconnection geometry, we show in\nFig. 23 (left panel) the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere as seen from\nabove the eccliptic plane. The dashed line represents the\nbow shock and the solid line is the non-reconnecting mag-\nnetopause. Magnetic field lines are drawn as arrows, here\nrepresenting a \u2212BX\/\u2212BY IMF topology. Thick arrows close\nto the highly bent newly-reconnected field lines (labelled A\nand B) indicate the direction of the curvature force towards\nthe east. Fig. 23 illustrates that this topology favours re-\nconnection in the noon and pre-noon sector resulting in an\neastward directed plasma flow (Gosling et al, 1990a; Cow-\nley 1981), which eventually must be projected down to the\nionosphere. Based on this reconnection scenario, Lockwood\net al. (2000) discuss how a number of consecutive reconnec-\ntion pulses that originate in temporal sequence between the\npoints A and B would develop in time, as seen at the iono-\nspheric footprint of the reconnected field lines (Fig. 23, right\npanel). The uppermost line in all 4 displayed time-steps, i.e.\nthe most equatorward boundary in Fig. 23 is considered to\nbe the open\/closed field line boundary, while the regions la-\nbelled 1\u20134 represent recently opened flux packages. From\nthese snapshot sketches of the development of open flux, it\ncan be seen that the reconnection pulse itself would initially\nlead to an equatorward erosion of closed flux tubes. Within\nthis newly reconnected region the tension force of the field\nlines will give rise to the development of eastward directed\nflow-channels within the next 10 min. As the tension force\non the westernmost field lines is stronger, a pile up of the\nreconnected regions will occur during their propagation to-\nwards the east and later towards the pole. We note that such a\nbehaviour is clearly reflected in the magnetometer data from\nthe meridional chain closest to the east of the inferred ori-\ngin of the initial reconnection site (central panel of Fig. 9).\nFirst there is an equatorward expansion of the new region\nof westward current, which suppresses the pre-existing east-\nward current regime, followed by a rapid poleward motion of\nboth the westward and eastward current regime.\nThe unbending of newly-opened field lines is closely as-\nsociated with the flow of field-aligned currents between the\nouter cusp and the ionosphere (Saunders 1989; Mei et al.,\n1995). The known pattern of such field-aligned currents,\nwhich imbed an eastward flow-channel for negative IMF BY\n(Cowley, 1991b), is in good agreement with the initial devel-\nopment of a field-aligned current pair by the AMIE method\n(Fig. 7b). These \u201ccusp\u201d-FAC are downward on the pole-\nward side and upward on the equatorward side. Thus, our\nobservation of a later developing additional downward cur-\n1390 H. J.

Also in the central panel,\nthe magnetic field component in the di-\nrection of the motion of the transient\nat 13:30 UT is plotted as a shaded red\ncurve. In the bottom two panels, we dis-\nplay the electric (left panel) and mag-\nnetic (right panel) vectors as a spatial\nfeature along the trajectory of the mov-\ning structure in GSE coordinates (RE\nunits) with an arbitrary origin in the\nvicinity of Cluster at 13:30 UT. The in-\ntensity of the field is colour-coded as\nto overcome projection ambiguities in\nthe 3-D presentation. Two major events\nare labelled (see text for more details on\nthis figure).\nrent sheet equatorward of the initial current pair must be due\nto a response of the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere sys-\ntem, thereby allowing for considerable return flow on lower\nlatitudes (see even the discussion concerning Cluster electric\nand magnetic field observations below).\nFollowing Lockwood et al. (2000), one can continue to\nreason that after propagation into the post-noon sector, the\nwesternmost reconnection pulses should contain lower fluxes\nof injected particles, as they have been travelling longer and\nwith a higher velocity than the leading events. This general\nconclusion is in excellent agreement with our observations\nof at least two encounters of cusp-like particle populations\nby Cluster, and the indication of two flow-channels and their\nassociated adjacent precipitation as seen by the ESR and the\nNAL cameras. In all data sets presented above, the second\ntrailing event was less pronounced than the leading one.\nHaving set the stage for why we believe that at a location\nof 15:00 MLT Cluster was hit by the eastward propagating\nfeatures of newly-reconnected flux tube packages, stemming\nfrom a pre-noon reconnection site, we can now closely in-\nspect the Cluster observations. First, we can conclude that\nthe CIS data most strongly indicates that a true encounter of\nthe cusp occurred with a total drop out of the trapped high en-\nergy ions occurring simultaneously with the arrival of high\nfluxes of low energy magnetosheath-like ions. The typical\nenergy dispersion of the ions is, however, barely visible in\nFig. 15. We note that the arrival of cusp ions at Cluster oc-\ncurs about 10 min after the first ground-based indications of\nongoing reconnection, which is corresponding roughly to the\ntime quoted by Lockwood et al. (2000) for the unbending of\nreconnected field lines, and by Lockwood and Davis (1995)\nfor the time span of ongoing cusp expansion after an initial\nreconnection pulse. The plasma density measured by CIS at\nthis moment is about 50% of the plasma density observed\nafter the exit into the magnetosheath at 15:00 UT (data not\nshown here, but such information is easily available from the\nCluster quicklook data on the Internet). This is in agreement\nwith similar observations of the exterior cusp and theoretical\nconsiderations on the mechanism for cusp plasma popula-\ntion (Cowley, 1981; Fuselier et al., 1991). Another indica-\ntion for a true cusp encounter is the direction of the observed\nion bulk flow. At 13:30 UT, CIS observes a primarily east-\nward (150 km\/s) and tailward (100 km\/s) flow with almost no\nvertical component (Fig. 15), while after the exit to the mag-\nnetosheath, CIS sees a typical ion flow around the magneto-\nspheric obstacle, with weaker eastward, but stronger tailward\nand stronger northward components (data not shown here).\nPerhaps more clearly than the CIS ion data, the Cluster\nH.

PEACE data of electron fluxes versus energy and time from the high energy electron detector (HEEA) on one spacecraft and the low\nenergy detectors (LEEA) on all 4 spacecraft from 13:20 to 14:05 UT. The two key events identified in the electric and magnetic field data in\nFig. 20 are marked with vertical arrows and labels.\nelectron data in Fig. 21 show how the trapped high energy\nelectron population is lost in a dispersed way immediately\nafter the onset of reconnection. This occurs simultaneously\nwith the arrival of the first low fluxes of sheath-like electrons.\nAgain, this is in agreement with earlier observations in the\nvicinity of the active cusp by Burch (1985) and Lockwood\nand Hapgood (1998). However, as was also pointed out as\ntypical by these authors, the main fluxes of sheath electrons\ndo not arrive from the reconnection site to the west of the\nspacecraft until the onset of main sheath ion flows is seen in\nthe CIS data. This represents a puzzling and still not fully un-\nderstood conservation of charge neutrality under such active\nconditions on newly opened field lines.\nThe loss of the trapped electron population at field lines\nconnected to Cluster at about 13:26 UT, without immediate\nlow energy electron and ion cusp-like plasma signatures, is\nadditionally confirmed by data from the DMSP F15 satel-\nlite, which had a very close conjunction with Cluster between\n13:25 and 13:26 UT (see Fig. 2). In Fig. 24, we show the par-\nticle spectrograms and ion flow data from the DMSP passage\nin question. In close agreement with the Cluster observa-\ntions the electron data of DMSP F15 shows how the satellite\nfirst passes the active and highly structured polar cap, a typ-\nical feature for northward IMF BZ conditions. At 13:25 UT,\nit enters a trapped electron population on closed field lines\njust to the north of the Cluster footprint, only to be overtaken\nagain by the equatorward erosion of the open\/closed field line\nboundary at 13:27 UT. DMSP-F15 enters the closed field line\nregion again, this time only slightly to the south of the Clus-\nter footprint, but not before 13:28 UT . This is unfortunately\n2 min too early to observe the arrival of the eastward propa-\ngating flow-channel and the cusp particle precipitation seen\nby Cluster at that time. It is, however, interesting to note that\nthe latitude of the open\/closed field line boundary crossed\nby DMSP-F15 at 13:28 UT is in very good spatial agree-\nment with the observation of the transient flow event seen by\nthe STF radar at 13:30:35 UT (see Fig. 11), and also with\nthe southernmost excursion of the new regime of westward\ncurrent flow, as seen by the Greenland magnetometers (see\ncentral panel of Fig. 9). Thus, the DMSP data confirms inde-\n1392 H. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event\n   \nFig. 22. STAFF spectrograms from 13:20 to 14:00 UT of electric and magnetic field fluctuations in the 8 Hz to 4 kHz regime (top two panels,\nrespectively) and lower frequency (0\u201310 Hz) magnetic fluctuations (bottom panel).\npendently that all discussed transient features seen from the\nground as well as from Cluster must indeed occur on newly-\nopened field lines.\nAnother puzzling feature in our observations is the tem-\nporal behaviour of the electric and magnetic field signatures\nseen by EFW and FGM (but also in the STAFF wave data).\nIn direct comparison to the DC electric and magnetic field\ndata in Fig. 20 (and Fig. 22 for high frequency variations),\none can easily see that the electric field responds much ear-\nlier, almost as early as the drop out of the trapped particle\npopulation, to the approach of the eastward flow-channel to-\nwards Cluster. In the original sketch of Southwood (1987)\nfor a possible ionospheric flow-channel geometry associated\nwith so-called flux-transfer events (FTE), return currents out-\nside the central flow-channel were considered as an essential\npart of the ionospheric and magnetospheric plasma flow pat-\ntern. However, such return flows have later proven to be diffi-\ncult to observe. Only recently, Pinnock et al. (1993), Rodger\nand Pinnock (1997), and Thorolfsen et al. (2000) have found\nclear observational proof of their existence. If one considers\nthat the electric field is closely associated with the plasma\nflow in the magnetosphere, then the EFW observations can\nbe explained. Centred around 13:30 UT, the electric field\ntransient observed by EFW (Fig. 20) shows a much longer\nlasting and less sharp feature than the particle signatures of\nthe passing cusp, in very much the same way as the bulk\nion velocity transient seen by the CIS instruments (Fig. 15).\nFig. 20 (bottom left panel) nicely illustrates how the elec-\ntric field associated with the approaching new flow-channel\n(well in advance of the actual encounter with it) is not only\nenhanced, but sheared by almost 180\u25e6, as compared to the\npre-existing convection electric field. It appears that a new\nlarge-scale, but FTE-like flow pattern is superimposed on the\npre-existing convection, thus, affecting the flow and electric\nfield well outside the main flow-channel itself. Similarly, the\nelectric component of the wave measurements (Fig. 22, top\npanel) reflects the high-frequency fluctuations in the return\nflow of the approaching central flow-channel.\nBut why is this early (i. e. distant) response to the ap-\nproaching flow-channel visible only in the electric and not in\nthe magnetic field observations? We have concluded earlier\nthat the combined ground-based data sets at ionospheric level\nstrongly indicate the presence of two field-aligned current\nsheets, which imbed the observed transient flow-channel,\nwestward current flow and adjacent particle precipitation. In\nthe ionosphere, such field-aligned current sheets form to-\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1393\n   \nFig. 23.

These field-aligned\ncurrents must smear out considerably on their way to the\nexterior cusp at the altitude of Cluster, and cannot be ex-\npected to be easily observable. Nevertheless, they must close\non the magnetopause and should, therefore, map out to the\nregion encountered by the Cluster spacecraft. In principle,\nthey must also maintain the characteristics of confined mag-\nnetic disturbances inside such a closed sheet current circuit.\nConsequently, we cannot expect Cluster to record any major\nmagnetic effects until the arrival of the field-aligned current\nsheets that contain the main flow-channel, the cusp particle\npopulation and the strongly enhanced magnetic field signa-\nture (see Fig. 20, upper panel). The sharpness of the mag-\nnetic onset in Fig. 19, striking satellite by satellite in the\nsame sequence as the particle signatures, is another strong\nargument for the relative confinement of this magnetic dis-\nturbance. Finally, the fact that the principal change in the\nmagnetic field direction at 13:30 UT is in the direction of the\nmotion of the transient structure (Fig. 20, right lower panel)\nsupports our earlier conclusion that Cluster is hit from the\nwest (i.e. in basically the GSE \u2212X direction) by the leading\nedge of the eastward expanding flow-channel. The fact that\nCIS also does not see any shear in the direction of the gross\nion bulk velocity at that moment (Fig. 15, top panel) is an-\nother important indicator of a head-on, rather than a sideways\ncollision with the flow-channel.\nFrom the upper panel of Fig. 20, it is clear that the main\ndeviation of B into the \u2212X-direction lasts exactly as long as\nthe cusp particle signatures, reflecting the close coupling of\nboth effects via field-aligned currents. We have noted earlier\nthat both magnetic and particle effects hit the spacecraft in\nthe same temporal sequence. Such a sharp magnetic field sig-\nnature confined within shielding field-aligned current sheets\nwould consequently also be the most plausible explanation\nfor the quite surprising observation of an increase in the total\nmagnetic field during this encounter of the exterior cusp. It\nshould typically decrease during encounters of the exterior\ncusp proper. We must conclude that our observations proba-\nbly deal with a rather untypical situation, where strong field-\naligned currents associated with the flow-channel result in a\nmajor deformation of the dayside magnetosphere, bringing\nthe cusp plasma from the pre-noon to the post-noon sector.\nHowever, at this stage of our understanding of cusp dynam-\nics, we have actually no clear view of how untypical this kind\nof behaviour actually is. Considering the unique coverage\nand quality of the data that is now at our disposal, we should\nprepare ourselves better for the encounter of more unknown,\nand probably not at all untypical features of cusp dynamics.\nThe last aspect of this event to be discussed is the fact that\nwe observe no indications of lobe cell reconnection, in spite\nof the fact that the IMF is clearly northward during most of\nthe studied interval. The data from the network of Super-\nDARN radars in Fig. 6 show at 13:35 UT a superimposed\ndayside convection cell in the same direction as the viscous\ntwo-cell convection pattern that remains in the contracted po-\nlar cap both before and after the main event. In addition the\nmagnetic meridian chain data, the optical auroral images, and\nthe data along the poleward directed individual radar beams\nshow only signatures of poleward moving transients, again a\n1394 H.

From top to bottom: electron and ion spectrograms and plasma flow measurements by the DMSP F15 satellite during a passage over\nGreenland from 13:08 to 13:38 UT on 14 January 2001 (see Fig. 2 for the orbit projection to the ionosphere).\nsign for subsolar reconnection, which is typical for south-\nward IMF BZ . Previous studies during intervals of large\nIMF clock angle deviations from the north-south meridian (in\nother words, IMF directions close to the equatorial plane with\nsmall BZ and large BY ) have shown that features of lobe re-\nconnection and subsolar reconnection can typically coexist,\nleading to a bifurcation of the cusp auroral features (Sandholt\net al., 1996, 1998a, b; Lockwood and Moen, 1999; McCrea\net al., 2000). In contrast, we have seen no signs of coex-\nisting sub-solar and lobe-reconnection features. In the case\npresented here a quite moderate deviation of the IMF clock\nangle from almost due northward to westward has resulted in\na surprisingly large magnetospheric and ionospheric effect,\nsolely caused by subsolar reconnection. The produced flow-\nchannel reached a longitudinal extent of more than 5 h in lo-\ncal time, transporting cusp plasma from its pre-noon location\nover into the post-noon sector.\n4 Conclusions\nIn this study, a wealth of global ground-based data and the\nfirst ever in situ multi-satellite data have been utilised to anal-\nyse a relatively unusual magnetospheric topology in a rel-\natively undisturbed solar wind condition. We have shown\nthat even moderate solar wind disturbances can lead to dra-\nmatic transient magnetospheric and ionosperic effects, such\nas the transport of cusp-like plasma and convection features\nover 5 h in MLT. Without the global and meso-scale ground-\nbased data (presented in new and more instructive ways),\nand the well coordinated combination with the first multi-\nsatellite data in space it would have been basically impossible\nto understand the phenomenon presented in this study. Most\nlikely, it would have passed by unstudied or alternatively, it\nwould have been catagorised as \u201cunexplained transient mag-\nnetosheath encounters due to some peculiar indention of the\nmagnetopause.\u201d\nWe recall that ever since the early history of Cusp stud-\nies there has been a tendency for studies using ground-based\ndata to contribute to the understanding of the Cusp as a tran-\nsient dynamic feature (e.g. Cowley et al., 1991a), while stud-\nies based only on satellite data, often inferred the Cusp as a\nrather static spatial feature. Combining knowledge from both\ntypes of datasets, today also statistical surveys of satellite\ndata (e.g. Newell et al., 1989, and Newell and Meng, 1992)\ncome to conclusions about dynamically growing and shrink-\ning Cusp features, reaching longitudinal extents of more than\n2 hours of MLT.\nThe event study presented here clearly raises a number of\nadditional questions:\n\u2013 If a moderate change in the IMF conditions during a\ngenerally quiet period can have such dramatic effects\non the extent and transport of Cusp-like features in the\nmagnetosphere (more than 5 h in MLT), then what can\nwe expect to happen during really disturbed conditions?\n\u2013 How can such a strong sub-solar reconnection event oc-\nH. J. Opgenoorth et al.: Cluster and ground-based observations of a transient cusp event 1395\ncur during, according to all that we know, quite un-\nfavourable conditions?\n\u2013 What is the role and how is the magnetospheric closure\nof the strong field-aligned currents in this process?\nWe believe that it is time to prepare ourselves for another\nrevision of our view of the dynamic cusp. A better and hope-\nfully final understanding of cusp dynamics in response to\nIMF changes can and will only be gained by the combination\nof data from global ground-based networks and the three-\ndimensional Cluster measurements in space.\nAcknowledgements.
