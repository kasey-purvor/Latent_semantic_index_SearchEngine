In this paper I want to shift my attention to love \nand examine how young men\u2019s experience of what they termed \u2018serious\u2019 relationships are \ncontexts in which they were engaged in the processes of exploring and, in some important \nways, remaking their masculine identities1.  \nThe shift in my interest from young sex to love reflects the course of a personal and \nprofessional journey over the decade since I wrote the \u2018Big and tough\u2019 paper. My \nprofessional interest in young people\u2019s views and experiences of sex developed with the \nemergence of HIV\/Aids in the United Kingdom the late 1980s. I worked in HIV prevention \nwith young people and then research. Although I was always interested in both the affective \naspects of sexual interaction and how intimate, relational practices and experiences were \ninfluenced by socio-cultural factors I drifted more and more towards contributing to \nbehavioural and intervention studies working with groups and population of young people. \nThis reflected imperatives of the time which included the development of a robust research \nbase which described young people\u2019s sexual behaviour and the evaluation of programmes \naiming to reduce the risks which were associated with it. As time passed, however, I found \nmyself asking with increasing frequency what depth and diversity of experience the \ncategorical measures that we employed in thee studies were concealing. Love emerged as a \nparticular interest in the context of the RIPPLE study (a randomised controlled trial of peer-\nled sex education in English secondary schools) where I was involved in annual surveys of \nseveral thousand young people (Stephenson et al., 2003, 2004; Stange et al, 2001). The self-\ncompletion questionnaire employed in the survey adopted several items that had been in use \n                                                 \n1\n The young men who participated in this study described a \u2018serious\u2019 relationship as involving intense, mutual \nemotional investment. \n3 \n \nin studies dating back to Michael Schofield\u2019s seminal work on young people\u2019s sexual \nattitudes and lifestyles conducted in the 1960s (Schofield, 1968). Among these was a \nquestion asking to what extent love had been a motivating factor in first sexual intercourse.  It \nwas of interest to me that some young people\u2019s responses altered over time. Surveyed at one \npoint they might indicate that they were definitely in love at the time of their first sexual \nintercourse; at a later date they might indicate that they were not sure if they had been in love. \nWhy, I wondered, did their views alter? Was this a correction in recall or an alteration in their \nunderstanding of their feelings, perhaps mediated by subsequent experience? What was \nchanging, love, them, or both? How did what we asked and how we asked it affect these \nresponses? What constructs of love might we be projecting through the questionnaire? How \ndid these constructs relate to the \u2018truth\u2019 about feelings? Could one ever abstract them from \nthe discursive and other contexts in which they were situated? Was there such a thing as a \nfeeling beyond or behind words and other forms of social construct? \nI would quite probably not have pursued these questions in any robust, academic way \nhad it not been for the chain of reflection that they initiated about my own experiences. As I \ngrew older, into early middle age, I spent time looking back on my youth. This was in part \nprompted by becoming a step-parent living with a teenager. I could see much in their \nrelational experiences that I recognised but also that they were indexed to resources \nunfamiliar to me, which in short, did not speak to me. It also was evident that the wider \ncontext was altering and that sex and sexuality were framed by public concerns and \nawareness about gender relations, sexualities and health risks which simply did not exist \nwhen I was young. I began to ask, as a man, a partner in a stable relationship and a step-\nparent what did this mean for understanding love? I felt a different sort of love to my youth, \nfreighted with different responsibilities and opportunities. It did not draw on the repertoire of \n4 \n \ncultural reference points to that of my stepchild and, very evidently, was profoundly inflected \nby gender. \nI recalled how status-enhancing having a girlfriend was and how it represented a \ndistraction from the grinding impersonality of school to be close and intimate with someone. \nI remembered the bitter-sweet taste left by the memory of screwing up my courage to ask \nsomeone out, the excited anticipation of furtive fumblings at a party or on a joint trip with the \nlocal girls\u2019. The blissful agony of composing wilfully elliptical poetry pledging my \neverlasting devotion to a girl I hardly knew. I remembered all the energy expended and all the \nenergy gained from manufacturing an opportunity to be alone together, soaking up the \nrawness and potency that it brought to the everyday, turning the park bench or promenade \ninto a set of a film in which I was the star.  \nThese particular kinds of emotional \u2018moments\u2019 had gone. Love was no longer the \nsame; not weaker but different. It was still configured within ideas of who I was, who I \nwanted to be and what kind of person my circumstances allowed me to be but these ideas of \nself and my circumstances had changed and so too, it seemed, had the kinds of feelings that I \ncalled love. Had I loved then? Why was \u2018young love\u2019 different and how were identities, \nfeelings and cultures bound up together?  \nStudying love, then, and especially among young men, represented a logical \nprogression bringing together introspective, personal considerations and my professional \ninterests.  \n \nRelationships, gender and identity work \nIt may seem a far from startling claim to suggest that intimate relationships are contexts for \nidentity work and that these processes draw on and refer to culturally embedded ideas about \ngender and sexuality.  Indeed, that most familiar form \u2013 the classical romance - focuses on \n5 \n \nheterosexual intimacy achieved through the exploration and transformation of gendered \nidentities.  Women become empowered and enriched by love and men transformed from \ndistant, cold and sometimes even hostile characters into sensitive, emotionally literate and \ndemonstrably caring beings (Stacey & Pearce, 1995).  It has been forcefully argued that even \nif the power and relevance of romance is waning and people are investing instead in \u2018pure\u2019 \nrelationships characterised by emotional confluence expressed and experienced via mutual, \nreciprocal intimate disclosure, these processes still take place against the background of \npowerful and resilient \u2018gendered languages of heterosexuality\u2019 (Bauman, 2003; Giddens, \n1992; Holland, Ramazanoglu, Sharpe & Thomson, 1998).  \nThese \u2018languages\u2019 have been conceptualised in terms of a repertoire of discourses \nwhich represent the \u2018public truths\u2019 about heterosexual masculinity and femininity (Holland et \nal., 1998: 84).  These can be renegotiated in the private context of the intimate relationship \nwhere, for example, the powerful \u2018truth\u2019 that young men are interested in sex and young \nwomen are interested in love can be explored, challenged and subverted. A young man may \nno longer see emotional intimacy as a demand made on him by young women in order to \nobtain sex and as a threat to their masculinity but as an opportunity for articulation and \nfulfilment of their desires, needs and anxieties.  \n Young men are well aware of this splitting of public and private masculinities and \nable to mobilise a variety of repertoires of meanings and practices in the ways that they enact \nand talk about intimacy in order to handle and negotiate the tensions between them (Frosh, \nPhoenix & Pattman, 2002; Wight, 1994; Wight & Henderson, 2004). They may, for example, \nunderstand relationships which are primarily organised around sexual pursuit and conquest in \nterms of the \u2018public truth\u2019 about male interest in sex and female  interest in love and those \nwhich focus on feelings as romantic (Redman, 2002). Their typologies may also include \nattachments which are characterised as primarily emotional or companionate and also be \n6 \n \ninflected by the duration of relationships (Allen, 2004). However, this is not some form of \nrelationship \u2018pick and mix\u2019 but relational aspirations, opportunities and resources for both \ntalking about and investing in them which are mediated by factors such as class, locality, \ncultural background and aspects of biography (Henderson et al., 2007; Holland et al., 1998; \nRedman, 1999, 2002).  \nThis paper seeks both to further elaborate our understanding of the nature and \nprocesses of gendered identity work that heterosexual young men may engage in via \u2018serious\u2019 \nrelationships and also how social contextual factors are influencing the timing and meanings \nthat these processes acquire.  In doing so, I am adopting a socio-cultural approach to \nunderstanding intimacy, relationships and emotions.  This approach posits that the forms that \nintimate relationships take and the kinds of emotions with which they are associated are \ncontingent on social structures, discourses, repertoires of cultural images and practices and \nthe roles occupied in specific social encounters (Averill, 1996; Bendelow & Williams, 1998; \nHarre, 1986; Hochschild, 1998, 2003; Lupton, 1998; Lutz, 1998,).  In this case I am \ndeploying this conceptualisation with the aim of demonstrating that it is local social \ninfluences, in particular the school and the family, and the forms of identity and personhood \nthat these make available, which bear on what  is possible, even desirable for these young \nmen to feel in relation to their experiences of intimacy with young women and how they \nunderstand these emotional practices in terms of constituting and making their identity as \nmen. \n \nMethods  \nData are drawn from a qualitative study which involved interviewing students in the sixth \nyear of a school situated in south-west Scotland about their views and experiences of being in \nlove.  School provided a context in which it was relatively easy to access young people, and \n7 \n \nin targeting sixth year students (who are mostly 17 and 18 years old) I expected to reach \nthose of an age to have had some experience of intimate relationships.  Access was negotiated \nvia the headteacher and with the permission of the school board.  Young people were \nrecruited to the study via a combination of short presentations about the study and the \ndistribution of paper-based information.  \n \nFrom a sixth year comprising around 50 young people I recruited 14 interviewees; 8 \nyoung men and 6 young women.  Another 9 young people contributed to three small group \ndiscussions.  In this paper I am reporting data from the young men who participated in \nindividual interviews.  No-one who expressed an interest was excluded from participation in \nthe research.  \n \nData collection  \nData were collected via two in-depth, lightly structured interviews which took place at an \ninterval or around two months.  Each of the individual interviews lasted between 45 and 75 \nminutes.  The first interview was organised around a question about the interviewee\u2019s \nexperiences of relationships and being in love.  The interviews followed a narrative trajectory \nthereafter in which I asked about the formation of relationships, their progress, what young \npeople did together and the emotional experience.  The interview closed with some more \ngeneral discussion regarding cultural representations and other people\u2019s views and values \naround love and relationships.  The second round of interviews provided an opportunity to \ndeepen my understanding of specific issues which had arisen in the first round.  I also \ngathered some basic demographic information including how interviewees identified their \nethnicity and sexual orientation.  \n8 \n \nAll the interviews were recorded and transcribed to paper.  Data were analysed via a \ngrounded approach inflected by the theoretical interests and insights which I have sketched \nout above.   Extracts from interviews presented here are intended to illustrate findings and \ndegree of consensus and\/or deviation among young men\u2019s views and experiences from these \nextracts is noted. \n \nEthical considerations \nThis study was subject to ethical governance of a UK University Ethics Committee and \nconducted to a strict protocol which entailed obtaining informed, written consent both prior \nand post interview, reminding participants of their right to withdraw at any time and holding \nand processing data in line with data protection regulations.  The study adhered to the child \nprotection policies of the school about which participants were informed.  Given the sensitive \nnature of the topic support was put in place for any participant who requested it.  Data are \npresented here in a form in which identifying references; to names, places and so on, have \nbeen altered or removed.  \n \nThe sample of young men \nSix of the young men identified themselves as white Scottish, one as white English and one \nas white Eastern-European.  All identified themselves as heterosexual.  All of the \ninterviewees were living with members of their biological family although Doug was living \nwith a father and step-mother.  Seven had siblings and four were the youngest child in their \nfamily.  The young men\u2019s families were broadly middle-class as defined by the occupation of \nthe principal wage-earner. \n \n9 \n \nAt the time of the first interview all the male interviewees had plans to enter \nuniversity and a profession thereafter.  Shane and Doug were considering teaching, Stephen \nmedicine and nursing, Ross, Gareth and Dan business and management.  Scott was thinking \nabout becoming an academic, and Franco an airline pilot.  In terms of relationship status and \nexperiences, 7 of the young men were in a \u2018serious\u2019 relationship at either the time of the first \nor second interview.  Angus had been in relationship which had ended recently.  \n \nFindings  \nI want first to look here at three specific dimensions of the \u2018serious\u2019 relationship which \nrepresent sites through which young men were remaking their masculinities.  Crucial to these \nprocesses was the idea that \u2018serious\u2019 relationship is a communion of souls which in itself was \nconsciously situated against an understanding of gender as difference configured within \nheterosexuality.  Ross summed this up as follows: \n \nRoss: I think men and women want the same thing at the end of day. A \nrelationship where they can trust each other and love each other and be \nclose, I mean that\u2019s what you look for. It\u2019s just that sometimes it feels \nlike they\u2019re starting miles apart.  \n \nSex and love \n \nDoug: Of course women want love. Men do too, but you know it\u2019s got to \ncome first for the lasses. They like to feel emotionally erm...., \ninvolved. For guys that comes but not always at the same time. Also \n10 \n \nyou don\u2019t need to be in love to enjoy a relationship. You know, you \ncan enjoy\u2026the company and the physical aspects too.  \n \nHere, Doug reprises the \u2018public truth\u2019 about the relationship between sex and love, \nmasculinity and femininity.  His analysis was recognised by all the male interviewees but \nsome saw it as patrolled by a group of young men with which they did not strongly identify. \nThis group were often termed the \u2018lads\u2019.  They were powerful, confident, apparently and \nostentatiously socially and sexually successful.  Scott distanced himself from these young \nmen and their particular version of masculinity by positioning their gendered and often \nsexualising discourse as immature. \n \nScott: There are lads, you know, who just talk about women and who they\u2019ve \n\u2018had\u2019 and what they\u2019ve got up to. I don\u2019t like it. It feels really \nimmature to me. They\u2019re just trying to make themselves look big and \nthey think it\u2019s funny but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just talk. It\u2019s sexist and pretty, \nwell...., stupid. You expect it of people when they\u2019re younger but I \nthink we should be leaving behind by now.  \n \nStephen was also negotiating this discourse, but the focus for him was more explicitly \non his relationship with his girlfriend and specifically his experiences and understanding of \nthe meanings of their physical intimacy.  He said, in the context of describing to me the \ndevelopment of his relationship with his girlfriend: \n \nStephen: Erm.... the first, first six weeks, we were doing things that you \nnormally do. Go round each other\u2019s houses, and, and more of a \n11 \n \nsexual relationship towards, the two month mark\u2026I think that \nwe knew that we could graduate to that, we knew we could sort of (.) \nhandle it, be more mature about it and be more sensible about it. It\u2019s \njust the way we are, the way both of us are, we\u2019re not exactly the most \nerm.... sexual-minded people. We don\u2019t go around just looking for a \npull. So we both feel it\u2019s right because it\u2019s the way we are\u2026We were \nboth virgins before each other. So it\u2019s a new experience for us both. \nIt\u2019s like a think (.) erm (.) a connection between us, it\u2019s a way of \nexpressing our feelings and it just makes them more and more intense. \n  \nThere are some similarities with Scott\u2019s account here: the distancing of self from \nother young men; the capital to do so apparently derived from a \u2018serious\u2019 relationship; and, \nthe reference to immaturity of a masculinity which focuses on sex for its own sake. \nSignificantly, Stephen was conscious of how these discoveries had altered his ways of \n\u2018doing\u2019 his masculinity in relation to his male friends.  He described a shift in his engagement \nwith and understanding of talk about relationships with young women among his male \nfriends: \n \nStephen:  [They say] \u2018What\u2019s she like?\u2019 or \u2018What have you done?\u2019 or the more \nimmature, erm.... more immature members of the common room \ngoing, \u2018Have you pumped her yet?\u2019 Yeah. They\u2019re always on about \nthat. It\u2019s funny because I used to be like that. I suppose I still can be \nactually.  \n \n12 \n \nWhat is startling about this candid observation about the self and others is Stephen\u2019s \nrecognition that he can still behave in a sexually objectifying manner himself.  This splitting \nwas implicit in many accounts.  For example, while Doug rehearses the \u2018gender gap\u2019 \ndiscourse in relation to sex and love he went on to talk about intense emotional investment in \nhis relationship with his girlfriend.  This seems to suggest that masculinities may not simply \nbe remade in any absolute way through \u2018serious\u2019 relationships but rather new positions \ncreated which young men may come to see as appropriate to different social contexts and \ninteractions.  \n \nCommitment and independence \n \nGareth: Women and men see it differently. I don\u2019t think men mind being in a \nrelationship at all, that\u2019s not it. But it has to have limits. It can\u2019t take \nover everything. You\u2019ve got to have your time with your mates for \nexample. I think sometimes women don\u2019t understand if you were just \nin the relationship totally so to speak, you won\u2019t be yourself. I think it \nshows commitment to let the other person be themselves actually.  \n \nHere Gareth suggests that emotional commitment to a relationship with young women \nthreatens and can even diminish masculinity.  Again this analysis was recognised by all the \nmale interviewees but some rejected it.  For example, Shane saw immersion in a \u2018serious\u2019 \nrelationship not as a means through which his identity was at risk of erosion but rather \nenrichment.  Shane had discovered this by accident. He described to me how, just recently, he \nhad thought that his girlfriend was pregnant, and after lengthy discussion with her, her and \n13 \n \nhis family he had decided that if this was the case, they would get married, he would find a \njob and they would settle down together.  \n \nNotwithstanding that Shane presented his point of view as a product of unforeseen \nand pressing circumstantial demands, he grasped this opportunity to index a particular form \nof masculine identity which allows him to make commitment without sacrificing any sense of \nhis independence.  His reference to marriage, settling down and forming a family may seem \nalternatively, optimistic, na\u00efve or commendable, but in any case he seems to be projecting \nhimself into an adult male identity which partakes of the idea of the pater familias; \nresponsible, selfless; a man who has status because he cares for and looks after a family. \n \nExpressing emotions \nShane: Boys, lots of boys don\u2019t know how to say what they feel, you ken \n[know]. Maybe no-one has spoken to them about feelings before and \nthey\u2019re sort of shy of it. I think if you do it, it gets easier. They maybe \ngo and kick a ball about or something rather than speak about it. If it\u2019s \nbad they kick the shit out it, if it\u2019s a good feeling they just want to \nblow off the energy. \n \nAs this suggests, Shane\u2019s perception was that, although young men have the capacity to talk \nabout their feelings, they are unpractised deterred by insecurities about the implications of \ndoing so and have alternative means of expressing themselves.  Other interviewees shared \nthis view and went further identifying both the \u2018gender gap\u2019 around talking about feelings and \nthe way that crossing that determined whether a relationship was \u2018close\u2019.  As Angus put it: \n  \n14 \n \n \nAngus: You need to talk, to say what you feel and about yourself and to listen \nwhen you\u2019re in a relationship. It\u2019s kinda natural for women. They\u2019re \nencouraged into it as they grow up. You can\u2019t really be close if you \ndon\u2019t talk. \n \nYoung female interviewees were very aware of this difference and male reticence to \n\u2018do\u2019 emotions and often took the lead in creating opportunities for intimate talk both before \nand during \u2018serious\u2019 relationships.  This partly may serve a self-protective function in terms \nof ensuring that they trust their boyfriends not to exploit them and their relationship but, for \nexample, broadcasting it in the sexually objectifying terms described by Stephen above. \nHowever, these young men enjoyed and found it a positive experience.  Furthermore, as \nFranco says here, the self-knowledge that it provided access to could be understood as \ncontributing to his masculine identity.  \n \nFranco: I mean, I\u2019ll tell her almost everything and, you know, like in about a \nmonth and a half when I\u2019ve been talking to her, like, its\u2019 that (.) she \nprobably knew me better than people do here [in school] for the past \nfour years. You really get to understand yourself better when you share \neverything about you with someone. Can\u2019t know yourself as a person \nwhat kind of man you are, unless share yourself.  \n \nSocial context as an influence on \u2018serious\u2019 relationships and gender \nThe three dimensions of the \u2018gender gap\u2019 identified by these men have a certain stereotypical \nquality which reflects the position that they occupy in the wider cultural background against \n15 \n \nwhich \u2018serious\u2019 relationships are formed and enacted.  I want now to turn to the question of \nhow these young men\u2019s negotiation of these differences is being influenced by the specific \nlocal and temporal context.  \n \nMaturity, status and school structure \nThe notion of \u2018maturity\u2019 is important in these young men\u2019s accounts of \u2018serious\u2019 \nrelationships.  It functions primarily as a means of differentiating lower and higher status \nrelationship practices and associated masculine identities.  At the top of the hierarchy sit \n\u2018serious\u2019 relationships which are connected with more \u2018mature\u2019 masculinities.  These were \nclosely associated with being a sixth year student.  Interviewees described a typology in \nwhich other forms of relationship and their associated masculinities were organised as a \nhierarchy linked to their passage through the school.  At the bottom were situated what were \ntermed \u2018kiddy\u2019 relationships.  These relationships were described as comprising \u2018dares\u2019 to ask \ngirls out.  They were regarded by these young men as less concerned with intimacy than \nmaintaining status with other young men.  These were followed in turn by, in around the \nsecond and third year, \u2018romantic\u2019 relationships which were talked about in terms of \nsuperficial emotional investment, then, in the fourth and fifth years, relationships were \nprimarily organised around sex.  I would contend that the typology of relationships and the \nhigh status of those that are \u2018serious\u2019 is connected in important ways to the kinds of \nsubjectivities which were available to these young men and, in important ways, mediated by \nthe age-maturity hierarchy created by school structure.  \n \nAt the time of interview these young men had made the latest and last step into the \nsixth year.  They experienced this as a very different environment from other, earlier year \ngroups.  These young men felt more actualised, they talked about taking responsibility for \n16 \n \nself-directed learning, exercising prefectorial duties, enjoying more equitable relationships \nwith staff  and having access to a common room.  All of these helped to create conditions in \nwhich the previously stifling homosociality was breaking down, greater individuality could \nemerge and the potential for interest in others as persons could increase.  Importantly, these \nprocesses were further contextualised by the slimming down of the student group as students \nperceived as non-conformist and less-academic left at the end of the compulsory phase.  \n \nThat these young men utilised these new conditions in the ways that did can be seen \nas associated with the value that they attached to school and this is in turn mediated by their \nbackgrounds.  They are academic, aspirant, individuals from middle-class backgrounds \nplanning to go to university and into \u2018good\u2019 careers.  Education, qualifications, study and \nachievement matter to them and this investment was validated by their families and peers. \nThis suggests an accretion of particular conditions is pertaining in this context that makes \n\u2018serious\u2019 relationships not only available but positively desirable in terms of narrative of the \nself.  \n \nModern, middle-class femininities  \nThese young men\u2019s experiences also seem to be inflected by ideas about the kind of middle-\nclass femininities that they perceived that their female partners aspired to.  Dan suggested \nthat women\u2019s access to the high-status, high-paid labour market might provide a vehicle \nthrough which conventional understandings of heterosexual relationships and gendered \npositions within these could potentially be reconfigured.  In our second interview he talked \nabout generational differences in relationships: \n \n17 \n \nDan: The main thing is probably that women expect to have careers and \ngood jobs. All the girls here, well nearly all, they\u2019re going to uni and \nwant to be doctors and teachers and erm.... lawyers. They don\u2019t want to \nbe committed to a relationship as young as maybe people did before. \nThat\u2019s a big change\u2026They can be the bread-winners now.  \n \nIn a way this view both helps to create a context for the \u2018serious\u2019 relationship \u2013 as a \ncoming together across gender differences \u2013 and simultaneously poses a  \u2018problem\u2019 for young \nmen interested in \u2018investing them\u2019 at this moment in time.  It shifts the ground in the \u2018gender \ngap\u2019 in an unresolved way and implies that avoidance of commitment may not be a male \npreserve.  This irresolution may explain the simultaneous recognition, rejection and \nenactment of sexism described in Stephen\u2019s account above, as a means of creating space to \nhold and understand femininities with which the available forms of masculinity do not fit \ncompletely congruently.  \n \nThe family \nFamily also emerged as a strong influence on the conduct and meanings of these young \nmen\u2019s \u2018serious\u2019 relationships.  This took a number of forms but three predominated: the \nparental relationships as a model (for better or worse) for one\u2019s own \u2018serious\u2019 relationships; \nthe ways that relationships were accommodated in family life; and, the idea that one\u2019s \nrelational capacities and needs were products of emotionally charged incidents within the \nfamily.  \n \nWith regard to the influence of relationships between parents these young men drew \nparticularly on modalities and practices which demonstrated emotional commitment.  They \n18 \n \ncited examples of parents celebrating their relationship, via anniversaries, gift-giving and \neveryday intimacies as well as resolving difficulties and talking about feelings as patterns for \nhow \u2018do\u2019 own emotions in the context of a couple.  With respect to how relationships were \naccommodated in family life what was apparent across the diversity of accounts was the \ndistinctions young men drew between cases and times, sometimes in context of one \nindividual\u2019s experiences, when relationships were taken seriously by their own and their \npartner\u2019s family and times when they were not accorded much recognition.  In the former \ncases, these parental reactions were seen as validating and in the latter as diminishing the \n\u2018seriousness\u2019 of the relationship.  \n \nBoth these themes are well illustrated in an account in which they were  brought \ntogether. Stephen recalled a Valentine\u2019s day when the men in his family each contributed a \ndish  prepared for their respective partners:  his older brother\u2019s girlfriend; his fathers\u2019 wife; \nand, Stephen\u2019s own girlfriend.  Stephen saw in this his relationship placed on a par with those \nof his male relatives.  He felt that their collective actions simultaneously validated emotional \ncommitment in relationships with women as properly masculine and drew him into this \n\u2018adult\u2019 identity. \nWith regard to the third theme the specific details of young men\u2019s accounts were very \nvaried, reflecting the complexities of their biographies. For example, Doug talked about how \nhis mother\u2019s death and father\u2019s remarriage had brought to the centre of family life issues \nabout relationships and love.  He said that in exploring his grief and feelings about his \nfather\u2019s new relationship (which were positive) he had been drawn closer to his girlfriend as a \nsource of support.  Shane told me about his childhood living in Northern Ireland.  He had \nwitnessed the shooting of a friend in a sectarian gun battle.  Shane vividly recalled the \nincident and felt that it had both formed the basis of his commitment to emotional openness \n19 \n \nand to rejecting any ideological barrier to relationships.  For Shane, the gender gap was like a \nsectarian divide: an ideological barrier to be overcome by refusing to acknowledge the \nconstraints that it placed on him.  He valued openness, commitment and intimacy in \nrelationships as ways of warding off division and conflict. \nDespite the very different narratives described here, what binds them together is the \npoint being made that what happens in the context of family life invokes strong feelings \nwhich influence the tenor of young men\u2019s future emotional practices and investments.  \n \nDiscussion \nI want to focus here on some of the possible limitations of this study and to identify \nsome further questions that it raises.  We have to take seriously questions about the \nsufficiency of the data referred to here to support both the interpretation I place on them and \nthe theoretical claims I stake as consequence.  It could be suggested that interviews with just \n8 young men, all from one community and attending one school does not allow me to \ndemonstrate that differences in relationship cultures may exist at a local level.  However, \nthree claims are supported by other data, which are not cited in this study, especially that \nwhich comes from young women who participated in the research.  Of course, what this \nlegitimate query suggests, above all, is that further research in other contexts, with people at \ndifferent points in their lives, and with other sexualities is warranted to examine, develop and \nnuance the proposition about the contingency of relationship cultures. \nWe also need to take into account that these data represent unfinished accounts.  The \npace and drama of change was in fact evident in the context of this study as these young \nmen\u2019s sense of self and their \u2018serious\u2019 relationships altered between interviews.  Some \nrealigned their educational aspirations and plans in light of exam results and the sustainability \nof their \u2018serious\u2019 relationship had to be reconsidered.  I suggest that this alerts us to enduring \n20 \n \ninconclusiveness of \u2018identity stories\u2019 and also the ways that all narrations of the self are \nmediated by a combination of past, present and future needs. \nThis also directs our attention to the importance of audience and recognition of the \nfact that these interviews are in themselves sites where young men\u2019s gendered identities are \nbeing actively renegotiated.  I would claim no simple relationship here.  For example, that for \nyoung men talking to an older man about feelings was difficult because it transgressed or \nconflicted with norms about interaction between men.  Nevertheless, there were moments \nwhen I became acutely aware that gender was mediating either a particular young man\u2019s \naccount or an aspect of it.  For instance, there were moments in interviews with Doug when I \nsensed difficulties for us both in talking about him or his feelings.  These seemed to be \nassociated with his experiences of working with a child psychologist at a time when he had \nbeen bereaved.  The therapeutic dynamic transferred from that encounter to our interview \ntroubled him and this involved gender.  Doug reminded me that he was \u2018one of the lads\u2019, that \nhe \u2018liked the banter\u2019 and \u2018liked to keep it light\u2019 as he rebutted questions about his feelings for \nhis girlfriend.  What I think was going on in this case was that Doug was working on finding \nways of positioning himself and me as men in a relationship which was neither threatening \nnor invasive.  Although these processes were not so apparent in other interviews there were \nno doubt present.  Far from diminishing or distorting the data I suggest that it is important \nneither to try to discount nor to minimise these effects but acknowledge and understand how \nthey may be mediating the encounters and my interpretation of them. \n \nSummary and conclusion \nIn this paper I have examined some of the ways that a small group of young heterosexual \nmen\u2019s experiences of what they termed \u2018serious\u2019 relationships can be seen as contexts \nthrough which they engaged in processes of exploring and, in some ways, remaking their \n21 \n \nmasculine identities.  I have described some of the aspects of the background culture of \ngendered differences with regard to love and relationships that they operate against and some \nof the practices through which these are resisted and negotiated.  I have demonstrated that the \nsociological claim that emotions can be conceptualised as socially situated interactions which \nare contingent on social structures, discourses, repertoires of cultural images and practices \nand the roles occupied in specific social encounters is helpful in enabling us to understand \nhow young men experiences are situated at a nexus of \u2018big\u2019 cultural ideas about gender, \nemotions and relationships and the specificities of the little cultural world that they inhabit.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nI am grateful to colleagues who read and commented on early versions of this paper and \nparticularly members of the London Sexuality Forum who gave me feedback on an oral \npresentation early in its development as a piece of writing.

He has written and taught about young people, sex, sexuality and gender for fifteen \nyears. He has a special interest in young masculinities.  His current research focuses on the \nemotions and intimacy. \nEarly in his career he taught in secondary and further education before getting involved in \nhealth promotion with young people in the mid 1980s. His developing interest in the social \naspects of adolescent health was reflected in his Masters degree which involved empirical \nresearch into the dance and drug cultures of the period, HIV\/Aids prevention for young \npeople and gender, sexuality and health.  Subsequently he moved into academic research \nworking on a number of studies and evaluations focusing on various aspects of young \npeople\u2019s sexual attitudes and lifestyles before becoming a Research Fellow in the Department \n22 \n \nof Sexually Transmitted Diseases at University College London and working on the RIPPLE \nstudy \u2013 a RCT assessing the impact of peer-led sex education targeting young people.  \nDuring his time at UCL Simon was involved in supporting medical students who initiated \ntheir own programme of peer-led community-based sexual health promotion and was \ninvolved in establishing a similar programme at St George\u2019s Medical School.  \nSimon\u2019s PhD is in sociology and doctoral research explored teenagers\u2019 experiences of being \nin love. Throughout his career Simon has contributed to under- and post-graduate teaching as \nwell as training programmes for professionals in health, welfare and education. He has also \ncontributed to a variety of national and international expert groups, advisory committees and \nconferences. \n  \n \n \nReferences \nAllen, L.
