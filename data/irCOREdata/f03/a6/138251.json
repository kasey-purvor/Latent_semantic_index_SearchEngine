Introduction \nAristotle concluded that thought is impossible without an image.  Thomas Babington Macaulay noted that \n\u2019\u2026logicians may reason about abstractions.  But the great mass of men must have images\u2019. \n \nVisualisation is \u201cthe process of representing data as a visual image\" (Latham 1995).  It is a longstanding \nfoundation tool for human understanding.  Graphical representations can communicate complex information, \nhelp understand complicated relationships between multiple variables, uncover information hidden in the data, \nand solve problems through visual representations in the form of data structures for expressing knowledge.  \nData Visualisation embraces digital images, geographical information systems, graphical user interfaces, \nmultidimensional tables and graphs, three-dimensional animation and virtual reality. \n \nVisual representations can facilitate problem-solving and discovery by providing a structure for expressing \nand communicating meaning of highly abstract data.  Visualisation potentially allows decision makers to \nexploit their natural spatial\/visual abilities.  This implies that visualisation, used appropriately, can allow the \ndecision maker to find the information in the data; it is a process for transforming data into forms that allow \ndiverse users to comprehend and interact with the information more effectively.  In the limit this can take the \nform of a man\u2013machine interface for the virtual presentation and manipulation of 3-D data in real time.  Any \nvisual representation that augments understanding of raw data is part of an information reality environment, \nFigure 1. \nP. J. Sackett et al. \n \n \nFigure 1:  Features of information reality (adapted from Wiendahl and Fiebig (2003)) \n \n \nThe field of manufacturing scheduling theory and practice is well researched and extensively applied.  \nManufacturing sequencing is the control of orders within the manufacturing process facility to provide a \nsequence of orders that cost effectively satisfies the sequence broadcast to the supply chain and the demands \nof end customers.  It is a classic complex problem domain that has the potential to defeat many analytical \ntechniques in all but the simplest application.  In manufacturing sequence management control applications \nsuch as responsive mode mixed model production lines, the demands on the decision makers to rapidly \ninterpret complex data and formulate a corrective response are challenging.  It would seem that the \nexploitation of data visualisation would be highly appropriate.  However, a recent review concluded that there \nis little published information on the application of visualisation to manufacturing sequence management \n(Sackett and Williams 2003a).  This problem domain is increasing in complexity with the adoption of Lean \nManufacturing and the Globalisation of supply chains with resultant high impact and rapid up and down chain \ninteractions.  Manufacturing sequencing has been a long term issue for automotive manufacturers but the \ncontext now extends across many product sectors such as white goods and electronics. \n \nIn this paper the authors review the techniques available, map these to manufacturing sequence information \npresentation requirements and identify the opportunities available and likely development paths. \n2. Visual representations \nThe importance of visual representation to support decision making has been emphasised by many researchers \n(Tufte 1990, Foil and Huff 1992, Morgan 1993, Lohse et al. 1994, Eden and Ackerman 1998, Rohrer 2000, \nGausemeier et al. 2001, Tan and Platts 2003b).  Visualisation is an accessible form of knowledge \nrepresentation (Larkin and Simon 1987).  Managers perform better when their problem-solving processes are \nadapted to the problem representation (Vessey 1991).  Mckim (1972) sees visualisation as a \u201cvisual\u201d vehicle \nof thought to assist managers in making decisions.  Foil and Huff (1992) point out that visual representation \nprovides new ways of examining and improving managerial judgement.  Visual representations are a means of \ndisplaying graphically the firm\u2019s current strategic position, identifying alternative routes to improving that \nposition. \n \nCognitive Fit Theory states that a solution to a problem is \"an outcome of the relationship between the \nproblem representation and problem solving tasks\" (Vessey 1991).  The better the \"fit\" is between these two \nconstructs, the more effective and efficient the problem solving process.  Therefore, when developing \ninformation visualisations, the developer must pay attention to the tasks performed by the decision-maker if \nthe visualisation is to be useful. \n \nThe manufacturing sequence problem solving tasks that visualisation technology can address are: exploratory, \nconfirmatory, and production (Grinstein and Ward 2002). \n\u2022 Exploratory tasks tend to be dynamic.  Users are normally attempting to search for structure or trends that \ncan be gleaned from the visualisation or create\/test hypotheses about the underlying information. \n\u2022 Confirmatory tasks tend to be stable and predictable.  The users normally attempt to confirm or refute \nhypotheses. \nA review of data visualisation \n\u2022 Production-based tasks are reporting related.  The users already have a validated hypothesis and are using \na visualisation-based report. \n \nTable 1 shows the offered functions of visualisation, corresponding to the three manufacturing sequence \nproblem solving tasks outlined above. \n \n \nTable 1: Visualisation functionalities (adapted from Platts and Kim (2004)) \n \n \n3. Techniques and designs \nInformation visualisation processes and tools are determined by the data type, the technique, and the \ninteraction and distortion used, Figure 2 (Keim 2001). \n \n \nFigure 2: Classification of information visualisation techniques (adapted from Keim (2001)) \n \n \nThe data type is set by the system to be visualised.  As discussed below, it can range through one-\ndimensional, two-dimensional, multi-dimensional, text\/web, hierarchies\/graphs, and algorithm\/software: \n\u2022 One-dimensional Data:  Usually has one dense dimension.  A typical example is temporal data as used in \nThemeRiver (Nowell et al. 2002). \n\u2022 Two-dimensional Data:  Has two distinct dimensions.  A typical example is geographical data.  X-Y-plots \nare a typical method for showing two-dimensional data and maps are a special type of X-Y-plots for \nshowing two dimensional geographical data.  Examples are the geographical maps used in Polaris (Tang \net al. 2002). \n\u2022 Multidimensional Data:  Data sets consisting of more than three attributes. Examples are tables from \nrelational databases, which often have tens to hundreds of columns (or attributes).  An example of a \ntechnique which allows the visualisation of multidimensional data is the Parallel Coordinate Technique \n(Inselberg and Dimsdale 1990).  Parallel Coordinates display each multidimensional data item as a \npolygonal line which intersects the horizontal dimension axes at the position corresponding to the data \nvalue for the corresponding dimension. \n\u2022 Text and Hypertext:  Cannot be easily described by numbers, and therefore most of the standard \nvisualisation techniques cannot be applied.  In most cases, a transformation of the data into description \nvectors is necessary first before visualisation techniques can be used.  An example for a simple \ntransformation is word counting (see ThemeRiver in Nowell et al. (2002)), which is often combined with a \nprincipal component analysis or multidimensional scaling (Wise et al. 1995). \n\u2022 Hierarchies and Graphs:  Data records having relationship to other pieces of information. Graphs are \nwidely used to represent such interdependencies. Examples are the e-mail interrelationships among \npeople, their shopping behaviour, the file structure of the hard disk, or the hyperlinks in the world wide \nweb. An overview of hierarchical information visualisation techniques can be found in Chen (1999), and \nan overview of web visualisation techniques in Dodge (2001). \n\u2022 Algorithms and Software:  Support software development by helping to understand algorithms, e.g., by \nshowing the flow of information in a program to enhance the understanding of written code.  This can be \nP. J. Sackett et al. \nachieved by representing the structure of thousands of source code lines as graphs to support the \nprogrammer in debugging the code as used in Polaris (Tang et al. 2002) by visualising errors. \n \nThe display techniques can range through: \n\u2022 Standard 2D\/3D Displays:  Such as bar charts and x-y plots (Tang et al. 2002). \n\u2022 Geometrically Transformed Displays:  Aimed at finding \u201cinteresting\u201d transformations of multi-\ndimensional data sets.  The class of geometric display techniques includes techniques from exploratory \nstatistics, such as scatterplot matrices (Cleveland 1993) and techniques which can be subsumed under the \nterm \u201cprojection pursuit\u201d (Huber 1985).  Other geometric projection techniques include Prosection Views \n(Spence et al. 1995), Hyperslice (van Wijk and van Liere 1993), and the well-known Parallel Coordinates \nvisualisation technique (Inselberg and Dimsdale 1990). \n\u2022 Iconic Displays:  Used to map the attribute values of a multidimensional data item to the features of an \nicon.  Icons may be little faces (Chernoff 1973), needle icons as used in MultidiGraph Visualisation \n(MGV) (Abello and Korn 2002), star icons (Ward 1994), stick figure icons (Pickett and Grinstein 1988), \ncolour icons (Levkowitz 1991, Keim and Kriegel 1994), and TileBars (Hearst 1995).  Examples of needle \nicons, star icons, and stick figure icons are presented in Figures 3, 4 and 5 respectively.  The visualisation \nis generated by mapping the attribute values of each data record to the features of the icons. \n\u2022 Dense Pixel Displays:  Mapping of each dimension value to a coloured pixel and grouping of the pixels \nbelonging to each dimension into adjacent areas (Keim 2000).  Since, in general, dense pixel displays use \none pixel per data value, the techniques allow the visualisation of the largest amount of data possible on \ncurrent displays (up to about 1,000,000 data values).  Dense pixel techniques use different arrangements \nfor different purposes.  By arranging the pixels in an appropriate way, the resulting visualisation provides \ndetailed information on local correlations, dependencies, and hot spots.  A well-known example is the \nrecursive pattern technique (Keim et al. 1995).  This technique is based on a generic recursive back-and-\nforth arrangement of the pixels and is particularly aimed at representing datasets with a natural order \naccording to one attribute (e.g., time series data).  The user may specify parameters for each recursion \nlevel and thereby control the arrangement of the pixels to form semantically meaningful substructures. \n\u2022 Stacked Displays:  Are tailored to present data partitioned in a hierarchical fashion.  In the case of \nmultidimensional data, the data dimensions to be used for partitioning the data and building the hierarchy \nhave to be selected appropriately.  An example of a stacked display technique is Dimensional Stacking \n(LeBlanc et al. 1990).  These embed one coordinate system inside another coordinate system.  The display \nis generated by dividing the outmost level coordinate systems into rectangular cells and, within the cells, \nthe next two attributes are used to span the second level coordinate system.  This process may be repeated.  \nA dimensional stacking visualisation of oil mining data with longitude and latitude mapped to the outer x \nand y axes, as well as ore grade and depth mapped to the inner x and y axes, is shown in Figure 6. Other \nexamples of stacked display techniques include Worlds-within-Worlds (Feiner and Beshers 1990), \nTreemap (Johnson and Shneiderman 1991, Shneiderman 1992), and Cone Trees (Robertson et al. 1991). \n \n \nFigure 3: A needle grid view of call data. Each axis represents the states of the US and density of phone calls made between pairs of \nstates is represented with a needle with multiple visual cues: colour, angle, and length (source reference: Abello and Korn (2002)) \n \n \nFigure 4: A star-map view of call data, superimposed with geographic information. For each state, a star is drawn which consists of \nline segments that represent phone call density to each other state. The circular order of the states is the same for all stars (source \nreference: Abello and Korn (2002)) \n \nA review of data visualisation \n \n \nFigure 5: Stick figure visualisation technique: (a) Stick figure icon, (b) A family of stick figures (source reference: Keim and \nKriegel (1994)) \n \n \nFigure 6: Dimensional stacking visualisation of oil mining data (source reference: Keim (2002)) \n \n \nIn addition to the visualisation techniques, it is necessary to use some interaction and distortion techniques.  \nInteraction techniques allow the data analyst to directly interact with the visualisations and dynamically \nchange the visualisations according to the exploration objectives.  They also make it possible to relate and \ncombine multiple independent visualisations.  Distortion techniques show portions of the data with a high \nlevel of detail.  The interaction and distortion techniques can be classified into: \n\u2022 Dynamic Projections:  Change the projections to explore a multidimensional data set.  A classic example \nis the GrandTour system (Asimov 1985), which tries to show all interesting two-dimensional projections \nof a multi-dimensional data set as a series of scatter plots. \n\u2022 Interactive Filtering:  Partitions the data set into segments and focus on interesting subsets.  An example \nof a tool which can be used for interactive filtering is Magic Lenses (Bier et al. 1993).  Other examples of \ninteractive filtering techniques and tools are InfoCrystal (Spoerri 1993) and Polaris (Tang et al. 2002). \n\u2022 Interactive Zooming:  Data representation automatically changes to present more details on higher zoom \nlevels.  An interesting example applying the zooming idea to large tabular data sets is the TableLens \napproach (Rao and Card 1994). \n\u2022 Interactive Distortion:  Interactive distortion techniques support the data exploration process by \npreserving an overview of the data during drill-down operations.  The basic idea is to show portions of the \ndata with a high level of detail while others are shown with a lower level of detail.  It should be noted that \nthere is a clear distinction between diagnosing a problem through the visualisation and identifying the \ncause of the problem.  The drill-down functionality associated with interactive distortion allows the users \nto focus on causality.  Popular distortion techniques are hyperbolic and spherical distortions.  Examples of \ndistortion techniques include Bifocal Displays (Spence and Apperley 1982), Perspective Wall (Mackinlay \net al. 1991), Graphical Fisheye Views (Sarkar and Brown 1994), Hyperbolic Visualisation (Munzner and \nBurchard 1995), and Hyperbox (Alpern and Carter 1991). \n\u2022 Interactive Linking and Brushing:  The idea of linking and brushing is to combine different visualisation \nmethods to overcome the shortcomings of a single technique.  Typical examples of visualisation \ntechniques which are combined by linking and brushing are multiple scatterplots, bar charts, parallel \ncoordinates, pixel displays, and maps.  Most interactive data exploration systems allow some form of \nlinking and brushing. Examples are Polaris (Tang et al. 2002) and the Scalable Framework (Lopez et al. \n2002). \n4. Information presentation requirements \n4.1 Examples of real-life systems for information presentation \nThe key challenges for information visualisation include creating visual representations that utilise human \nvisual perceptual capability and enhance human information comprehension.  As an example, Andon systems \nencompass visual display of manufacturing data from simple metrics to more complicated performance or \nP. J. Sackett et al. \nstatus measures (Phaal et al. 2004).  Andon became popular in the late 1980's in Japan and elsewhere as a key \ncomponent of the Just-In-Time manufacturing philosophy.  Traditional Andon systems consist of a panel of \nlights, each of which are connected to machines and devices located on the factory floor.  Whenever the state \nof a machine or device changes (e.g., in operation, not in operation, jammed, etc.), the Andon panel gives \nmanagers an immediate, visual update regarding the change.  Unlike traditional Andon systems using light \nbulbs hard-wired to machines, the new generation Andon systems work through the computer video monitor.  \nThe display is user-configurable.  The user can add new physical devices at any time and determine the \ncircumstances under which the device should alert managers via the Andon display. \n \nAnother example is TreeMaps (Asahi et al. 1995) that is designed to visualise large amounts of hierarchical \nand categorical information such as file directories, budgets, sales data, and organisational structure data.  \nMore than a thousand data elements can be visualised in TreeMaps.  A second example is the work at AT&T \nthat has focused on visualising network-related and geographically related data (Becker et al. 1995).  Other \nexamples include SemNet for visualising knowledge base information using a hierarchical context (Fairchild \net al. 1988), and Cone Trees for visualising huge information hierarchies (Carriere and Kazman 1995).  Yet \nanother example is the Geographic Information System (GIS), which uses the geographical structures among \ndata objects.  In summary, these information visualisation studies, and the visualisation systems that emerged \nfrom them, address the high volume of data that is typical in managerial decision-making domains. \n4.2 Role of information presentation in manufacturing \nThe challenge to producers - who may or may not be manufacturing a product - is to improve the \nsynchronisation of component parts brought together for the finished product often in the context of the global \nenvironment.  This coordination and waste elimination strategy is a fundamental principle of lean \nmanufacturing that has broad application in the manufacturing base.  Just-In-Time delivery is required for \nmany manufacturing processes to minimise inventory and line-side stock.  Where perishable produce is \nconcerned, Just-In-Time delivery is essential if the end product is to reach the consumer in a saleable \ncondition (Wheatley 2004).  In this model a key factor is the time taken to move produce from lower tier \nsupplier to the tier one or Original Equipment Manufacturer.  In planning this process simple logistics tools \ntend to imitate traditional master production schedules.  Where there are varying customer demand schedules, \nthere is a need to be able to change rapidly to reflect the aggregate Bill of Materials for the period of \nproduction in question.  The inability of planning aids to reflect this variability is a typical limitation of less \nsophisticated scheduling applications.  Advanced Planning and Scheduling systems are increasingly used to \nhelp Manufacturing, Production and Logistics planners satisfy manufacturing constraints; the two principal \ntypes relate to external logistics and shop floor planning.  Successful application of these tools highlights an \nimportant consideration for visualisation based decision support tools \u2013 \u2018how intuitive they are to apply\u2019.  \nIntuitive use includes being able to query (use) the tool using natural language or non-imperative \ncommunication and receive information in a language neutral format both of which will aid uptake of this \ntechnology. \n4.3 Key functional requirements for manufacturing sequence information presentation \nThe key functional requirements for manufacturing sequence information presentation are summarised in \nTable 2. \n \n \nTable 2: Manufacturing sequence information presentation requirements \nA review of data visualisation \nA brief description of these functional requirements is provided below. \n\u2022 Dynamically Update with Manufacturing Sequence Data:  The constant flow of materials throughout the \nmanufacturing process requires quick and easy access to information about a constantly changing \nenvironment.  The data visualisation system should dynamically update with manufacturing sequence data \nto satisfy historical and real-time information requirements (Ping 1996, Tien-Lung 2003). \n\u2022 Maximise Benefits from Just-In-Time Lean Manufacturing by Highlighting Areas Where Problems \nConsistently Occur:  Benefits from Just-In-Time Lean Manufacturing are maximised when delivery of \ncomponents and assemblies to production is matched by assembly of those components to a finished \nproduct in a planned order.  The data visualisation system should highlight where production has to invest \nresources to meet the production schedule and where an un-buildable mix is consistently being given \neither because of regular plant breakdowns or other constraints (Gerace and Gallimore 2001, Sackett and \nWilliams 2003b). \n\u2022 Communicate Current and Predicted Production Status:  The data visualisation system should process \nand display manufacturing sequence data to communicate an accurate impression of the production status \nto the manufacturing personnel.  It should show where the manufacturing plant currently stands with \nrespect to derivatives.  It should also predict the effect of the volume constraints and the future customer \nOrder Bank (Keim 2002, Sackett and Williams 2003a). \n\u2022 Address Different Levels of Decision Makers:  A typical manufacturing scenario involves multiple \ndecision makers, such as manufacturing management, supervision and operations personnel, requiring \ndifferent levels of information.  Therefore the data visualisation system is required to have the ability of \ndisplaying the information in a hierarchical form (Zhang 1998).  The major advantage of interactive \nhierarchical graphs over static images is the ability to drill down to more in-depth information if needed \n(Yurin 1994). \n\u2022 Communicate Information with Suppliers:  Achieving the right product mix whilst meeting customer \ndemand requires effective communication with the global supplier base.  Information should be easily \nextracted and exchanged between databases, enhancing Advanced Planning and Scheduling applications.  \nThe new Internet and collaboration technologies open up further opportunities of making the tool \navailable to suppliers and other external parties (Lee and Campbell 2003).  This implies that items \nrequiring a high processing overhead are less likely to be communicated.  However, computationally \nexpensive items could have a higher value in the context of visualisation and would consequently be \ntransferred at the expense of \u2018cheaper\u2019 data. \n\u2022 Deal with Complex & Disparate Software\/Databases in a Manufacturing Environment:  The data \nvisualisation system should integrate with legacy, as well as state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf technology \u2013 or \na combination of the two (Wu and Ellis 2000).  Large multi-dimensional, cross-relational databases have \nbecome very common for the management and distribution of information throughout manufacturing \norganisations.  Managers as well as front-line workers need tools for the exploration and analysis of these \ndatabases (Hameri and Nihtila 1998).  These tools should be able to connect directly to multiple data \nsources.  The resulting displays should have the ability to change dynamically as the data underneath them \nevolves.  Here it is important to note that the level of intervention required by the \u2018technician\u2019 \nimplementing such communication will vastly improve the opportunity for uptake of the technology. \n5. Functional mapping \nTable 3 identifies the visualisation functionalities that address the key functional requirements for \nmanufacturing sequence information presentation.  The offered functions of visualisation are extracted from \nTable 1 and the key functional requirements for manufacturing sequence information presentation are \nP. J. Sackett et al. \nextracted from Table 2.  Table 3 shows that all the functional requirements are serviced by at least one \nvisualisation functionality.  As an example, the functional requirement \u2018highlight areas where problems \nconsistently occur\u2019 is addressed by the following visualisation functionalities: \u2018focus attention\u2019, \u2018trigger \nmemory\u2019, \u2018stimulate thinking\u2019, \u2018challenge self-imposed constraint\u2019, \u2018identify structure, trends, and \nrelationships\u2019, and \u2018highlight key factors\u2019. \n \n \nTable 3: Visualisation functionalities and functional requirements \n \n \nTable 4 maps the visualisation techniques (extracted from Figure 2) to the functional requirements (extracted \nfrom Table 2).  As an example, the functional requirement \u2018highlight areas where problems consistently \noccur\u2019 is addressed by the following visualisation techniques: filtering, zoom, and distortion.  Table 4 \nillustrates that some functional requirements (such as \u2018dynamically update with manufacturing sequence data\u2019 \nand \u2018communicate information with suppliers\u2019) are more challenging for the visualisation techniques than \nother requirements.  Similar to the case of Table 3, all the functional requirements are serviced by more than \none visualisation technique.  Tables 3 and 4 can together be used to identify the visualisation functionalities \nand techniques that service each of the key functional requirements for manufacturing sequence information \npresentation. \n \n \nTable 4: Visualisation techniques and functional requirements \n \n \nTable 5 maps the data visualisation applications reported in literature to the functional requirements for \nmanufacturing sequence information presentation.  Typically these real world applications involve a \ncombination of visualisation techniques.  A majority of these applications in literature correspond to four of \nthe functional requirements presented in Table 5: \n\u2022 Communicate Current and Predicted Production Status:  Many data visualisation applications deal with \ngenerating plots for analysing a data set or stream for process monitoring, analysis and visualisation. \n\u2022 Highlight Areas Where Problems Consistently Occur:  This is one of the key motivations for the majority \nof process monitoring and virtual reality related applications of data visualisation. \n\u2022 Address Different Levels of Decision Makers:  This functional requirement is addressed by a wide variety \nof application areas.  Many of these applications provide drill-down operations, while preserving an \noverview of the data.  This functionality allows the users to focus on causality.  It also makes the \nvisualisation tool useful for a broad range of users, requiring different levels of information.  In addition, it \nprovides a common platform to different levels of decision makers to communicate with each other. \n\u2022 Deal with Complex and Disparate Software\/Databases:  There are two main categories of applications \nthat address this functional requirement.  The first category of applications deals with the integration of \nexternal systems with the visualisation tool.  This reduces the user intervention and eases the use of the \nvisualisation tool, thereby improving the opportunity for uptake of the technology.  The second category \nof applications aims to identify patterns to visualise the abstract, multi-dimensional production data stored \nin tables.  The idea here is to take advantage of human\u2019s rapid and flexible pattern recognition capacity to \nprovide a powerful information-processing environment.  As shown in Table 5, a wide variety of \napplication areas deal with this functional requirement. \n \n \nA review of data visualisation \nTable 5: Applications and functional requirements \n \n \nTable 5 highlights that there is a dearth of applications reported in literature for \u2018dynamically updating with \nmanufacturing sequence data\u2019 and \u2018communication with suppliers\u2019, both of which are critical in a global \nmanufacturing environment.  This is in-line with the observation from Table 4 that there is a lack of \nvisualisation techniques in these two areas. \n6. Discussion and conclusions \nTables 3 and 4 demonstrate that all the functional requirements are serviced by at least one visualisation \nfunctionality and at least one visualisation technique.  Some functional requirements (such as \u2018dynamically \nupdate with manufacturing sequence data\u2019 and \u2018communicate information with suppliers\u2019) are more \nchallenging for the visualisation techniques than other requirements. This also explains the dearth of \napplications reported in literature in these areas, Table 5.  However, the fast growing enabling technologies \n(such as ready availability of processing power and displays, the Internet, interface standards and advanced \nalgorithms) are now providing new opportunities to deal with the challenges posed by these areas. \n \nAs shown in Table 5, there are a number of applications reported in literature for communicating current and \npredicted production status, highlighting areas where problems consistently occur, addressing different levels \nof decision makers, and dealing with complex and disparate software\/databases.  In our analysis, we have \nmade no comment concerning the intrinsic or relative effectiveness of the various visualisation techniques.  \nThere are two reasons for this.  First, the value of a particular technique depends very much upon the \napplication domain, the user and the task being performed.  Second, a combination of techniques is typically \ninvolved in a real world application. \n \nThe above analysis draws out that the same underlying data can contain a variety of information that has value \nto a number of users.  These users can be considered as information \u2018consumers\u2019 on the basis that the \ninformation is needed to make decisions that affect business efficiency and ultimately survival.  Therefore the \nsame base data needs to be viewed from a number of different perspectives, and hence prescriptive \nvisualisation has relatively limited application. \n \nBy extension we can argue that supply chain efficiency\/coordination can be improved by providing tools that \nexpose the impact of decisions in one part of the supply chain on overall performance.  For the Original \nEquipment Manufacturers this can be interpreted as the impact on Just-In-Time manufacturing and their \nability to produce to schedule.  There is another parallel that can be drawn if we take the concept of exposure, \nas mentioned above, and consider web services.  Essentially web services are a set of networking or \ncommunication protocols.  Simple web services can be thought of as transactional dialogues; complex web \nservices as longer term, more diverse and focused on business process management rather than discrete \ndecision management.  Web services are based around a number of Internet standards and exploit properties \nof discovery and exposure.  A new web service could be written to visualise certain data and, for example, \nsupply chain collaborators would then \u2018discover\u2019 this service when it announced or \u2018exposed\u2019 itself. \n \nThe graphical representation of data should itself be kept under control and not allowed to become too \n\u2018clever\u2019 for the user to interpret.  The main concern here is in the use of three-dimensional representation.  \nCurrent display technology is restricted to two dimensions.  This constrains the essential spatial component of \n3-D display and hence the associated information.  Additionally there is the cognitive limitation of the user in \nP. J. Sackett et al. \nbeing able to assimilate and process the data when represented in this way.  To address these issues, there is a \nneed to introduce a significant level of interactivity which itself raises the level of technology that would be \nrequired to visualise the data.  Where the 3-D representation is particularly useful is in situations where the \ngraphic being used to represent a variable or variables enhances understanding because of an association for \nexample the usage of a computer disk drive through a volumetric analogy \u2013 how empty or full is the drive. \n \nThere are four main areas of relevant future research and development.   \n \nThis paper has highlighted that there is a dearth of data visualisation applications reported in literature for \n\u2018dynamically updating with manufacturing sequence data\u2019 and \u2018communication with suppliers\u2019, both of which \nare critical in a global manufacturing environment.  Exploitation of visualisation techniques to service these \ntwo functional requirements for manufacturing sequence information presentation is therefore an important \narea for future research. \n \nAnother research direction involves the exploitation of knowledge capture in manufacturing sequence data \nvisualisation.  This can be achieved through the integration with existing manufacturing systems where this \ncompliments the visualisation and allows a cross-section of the process state at a given point in time as an \nadditional diagnostic. \n \nEnhancing the capability of visualisation tools to adjust to a number of different permutations of process \nstates would be helpful.  The motivation here is to develop a visualisation tool that is capable of being \nemployed in a variety of situations.  In this case, contemporary programming approaches lend themselves to \nsuch diversity. \n \nThe global nature of manufacturing has potential implications for visualisation in sequence management.  The \ndevelopment of data visualisation tools that appreciate culturally embedded communication differences \nbetween eastern and western organisations is a prospective area.  Although there is information concerning \nthe impact of cultural differences on business in general (Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner 2003) and the \nembedded cultural messages that need to be considered when cross cultural communication is undertaken, no \nmaterial has been published concerning the different requirements of these supply chains.  Based on the \ndifference in organisation and culture, it would seem reasonable to expect the information broadcast to the \ntwo supply bases to vary.  However, the global adoption of lean manufacturing principles and common goal \nof waste reduction will tend to over-ride any significant difference in information requirement arising as a \nresult of cultural difference.  Culturally embedded communication differences will therefore continue to be an \nissue in terms of presentation but it will be of secondary importance to the format in which sequence or \nscheduling information is presented.  The authors conclude that much of the functionality required already \nresides in the visualisation tools but it is not being exploited. \nReferences \nAbello, J. and Korn, J., MGV: A system for visualizing massive multidigraphs, IEEE Transactions on \nVisualization and Computer Graphics, 2002, 8(1), pp. 21-38. \nAdam, G.K. and Mastorakis, N.E., High level programming and control of a manufacturing system, WSEAS \nTransactions on Circuits and Systems, 2003, 2(1), pp. 301-308. \n \nA review of data visualisation \nAlabastro, M.S., Beckmann, G., Gifford, G., Massey, A.P. and Wallace, W.A., The use of visual modeling in \ndesigning a manufacturing process for advanced composite structures, IEEE Transactions on Engineering \nManagement, 1995, 42(3), pp. 233-242. \nAlpern, B. and Carter, L., The hyperbox, in Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE Conference on Visualization, 1991, \nSan Diego, California, pp. 133-139. \nAsahi, T., Turo, D. and Shneiderman, B., Using treemaps to visualize the analytic hierarchy process, \nInformation Systems Research, 1995, 6(4), pp. 357-375. \nAsimov, D., The grand tour: A tool for viewing multidimensional data, SIAM Journal on Scientific & \nStatistical Computing, 1985, 6(1), pp. 128-143. \nBaldwin, D.F., Abell, T.E., Lui, M.-C.M., De Fazio, T.L. and Whitney, D.E., An integrated computer aid for \ngenerating and evaluating assembly sequences for mechanical products, IEEE Transactions on Robotics \nand Automation, 1991, 7(1), pp. 78-94. \nBassett, E., Better data analysis?
