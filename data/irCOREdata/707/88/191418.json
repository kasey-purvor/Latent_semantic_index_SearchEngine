UK. \nWe have localized the placental endothelial marker \ncaveolin-1 at the ultrastructural level using \nindirect immuno-labeling with particles of colloidal \ngold 10nm in diameter. The particulate label has \nbeen quantified per unit area to assess the \ndistribution of the target protein within placental \nchorionic villi and basal plate in term placentae. \nVery low levels of labelling were detectable over \nembedding medium that was free of tissue, \nerythrocytes, serum-filled cavities and \nextracellular matrix. The mesodermal \ncompartment of the tissue was more heavily \nlabelled than the ectodermally derived chorionic \nvillus trophoblast. Within the mesodermally \nderived cells, the distribution of anti-caveolin-1 \nlabelling within endothelial cells was maximal. \nIntracellularly there was a clear tendency for the \nlabelling pattern to be marginated in the \nendothelial cells. Our approach to quantitating \nthis was to measure particles per unit area in \napical, basal and central (\u201cABC\u201d) strips in order to \nassess whether it was polarised or not.
