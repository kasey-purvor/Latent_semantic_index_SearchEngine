After government security forces in late 1992 \ncrushed these efforts in the neighbourhood of Munira Gharbiyya, \ninformal Cairo became pathologized in public discourse as \ncashwa\u2019iyyat (\u2018random\u2019 or \u2018haphazard\u2019 areas), a zone of socio-\nspatial disorder threatening Egypt as a whole and demanding state \nintervention. \n \nHowever this securitizing move did not lead to heavy-handed \nintervention against informal Cairo more generally. Following the \nsuppression of the militants, the Mubarak government instead \nreturned to long-term patterns of indifference and neglect that had \nallowed informal neighbourhoods to flourish since the 1960s. In \npart, the absence of intervention can be explained in terms of \nresource constraints and risk avoidance. More profoundly however, \nit reflects numerous linkages between informal urbanization and the \nEgyptian state. The cashwa\u2019iyyat are, to a significant degree, a \nconsequence of an authoritarian political order as well as embedded \nin the informal control stratagems used by Egyptian governments \nto bolster their rule. Informal Cairo should thus not be understood a \ndisorderly zone of subaltern dissidence. Rather the Egyptian state is \nbest seen as facing its own oblique reflection. \n  \n \n \n \nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\nFor Peer Review\nIn December 1992, 18,000 paramilitary police equipped with armoured cars and bulldozers besieged \nmilitants from the Gamaca Islamiyya (Islamic Group) in the North Giza neighbourhood of Munira \nGharbiyya (see map), also known as Imbaba, part of the Greater Cairo agglomeration (Denis 1994; \nSingerman 1999). The \u2018Siege of Imbaba\u2019 came early in a protracted confrontation between militants and \nthe Egyptian state which continued until the latter half of the 1990s and culminated in the Islamists\u2019 \ndefeat (Gerges, 2000). Lasting several weeks, it was characterized by indiscriminate mass arrests, hostage-\ntaking by the security forces to secure the surrender of suspected militants and the \u2018widespread\u2019 use of \ntorture (Sherry, 1995: 13). A report from an Egyptian human rights group in early 1993 claimed the \ncitizens of Munira had initially welcomed the police intervention \u2018hoping to be rid of the oppression \npracticed on them by the Islamic Group in Imbaba. But after two months... the slogan most popular was: \n\u201cThe hell of the Muslim groups is better than the police\u2019s heaven\u201d\u2019 (Sherry, 1995: 12). \nMunira, and other Cairo neighbourhoods where the Islamists had also established themselves, were \n\u2018informal\u2019. They had been built without official authorization\u2014a symptom of the city\u2019s rapid growth since \nthe 1950s\u2014and were hence outside the umbrella of state planning and infrastructure. Seemingly beyond \nthe reach of President Husni Mubarak\u2019s government, the Islamists mounted an urban guerrilla campaign \nagainst it and sought to create a \u2018state-within-the-state\u2019. Indeed, the Mubarak government\u2019s intervention \nhad apparently been provoked by the militants\u2019 (somewhat premature) proclamation of an \u2018Islamic \nRepublic of Imbaba\u2019 to western journalists. \nIn its wake, both state officials and Egyptian public \u2018discovered\u2019 that much of the Egyptian capital was \noutside the framework of state planning. Media reportage and more official texts labelled such informal \nneighbourhoods manatiq cashwa\u2019iyya\u2014\u2018random\u2019 or \u2018haphazard\u2019 areas, collectively \u2018cashwa\u2019iyyat\u2019\u2014and \npathologized them as squalid havens for criminals and terrorists, a direct threat to Egypt\u2019s physical, moral, \nand political health. In this implicitly securitizing discourse, such disorder demanded state intervention, \nnot just to expel the Islamists but also to rebuild the physical environment and reform its inhabitants. The \nlonger-term fear engendered by the discovery of the unruly city, urban Islamists and their plebeian \nsupporters contributed to Cairo\u2019s 1990s building boom, as Egypt\u2019s elite retreated to \u2018gated communities\u2019 \non the city\u2019s desert periphery (Denis, 2006). \nThe \u2018Siege of Imbaba\u2019 and the case of informal Cairo speak to broader discussions of state-society \nrelations in Egypt and urban insecurity in the developing world. The cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse is ironically \nechoed in the claims of western observers that informal Cairo represented an \u2018oppositional space\u2019 outside \nthe purview of a state which controlled only the \u2018main axes\u2019 of the country (Ismail, 2000: 379; Roussillon, \n1998: 390). The discourse itself would appear to be a species of the \u2018imaginative geographies\u2019 of alterity \nand menace that now commonly frame discussions of urban insurgency and counterinsurgency (Graham, \n2006). More concretely, the \u2018Islamic Republic of Imbaba\u2019 seems to confirm the linkage between \nurbanization and threats to state stability or human security suggested by Brennan-Galvin (2002) and \nLawson et al. (2008). The events of December 1992 further exemplify the claim that global cities like \nCairo have become back-drops in the theatre of international terrorism (Savitch & Ardashev, 2001). \nPage 1 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n2 \nLastly, the gated communities boom on the Cairo periphery is suggestive of the process, observed in \nLatin America and South Africa, where social inequality and violence produce urban polarization\u2014\nenclaves of affluence amidst mass squalor (Caldeira 2000; Lemanski, 2004). \nYet closer scrutiny of the Cairo case suggests that, on the whole, the city is not a highly violent and \nconflictual environment outside the control of the state. After expelling the Islamists and making \nessentially token efforts to demolish and upgrade a few informal Cairo neighbourhoods, the Mubarak \ngovernment effectively returned to the long-term patterns of indifference and neglect that had allowed \ninformal Cairo to flourish since the 1960s. Such de facto policies of inaction are puzzling given the \napparent threat posed by Islamist militants and the authoritarian top-down character of the Egyptian \nstate\u2019s rule. To a limited extent, its inaction can be explained in terms of resource constraints and risk \navoidance. But since the 1970s, Cairo\u2019s rulers have had access to substantial urban-development \nassistance offered by international donors who were well aware of the city\u2019s dangers and challenges. \nThis article will argue that apparent state inaction actually reflects numerous linkages between informal \nurbanization and the Egyptian state. To a significant degree, the cashwa\u2019iyyat are a consequence of an \nauthoritarian political order from which the majority of Egyptians are excluded. Moreover, while the \ncashwa\u2019iyyat discourse\u2014and some scholarly accounts\u2014depict informal neighbourhoods as confronting the \nstate, in practice Egyptian governments have tolerated and sometimes even tacitly encouraged them. \nInformal urbanization ironically helps to reproduce a political order based on elite privilege by insulating \nEgypt\u2019s rulers from bottom-up demands for housing and services. Thoroughly embedded in the \nclientelistic stratagems used by Egyptian governments to bolster their rule, informal communities have \nallowed these governments to achieve a surprising degree of state-society integration despite a political \norder predicated on exclusion. Hence the city\u2019s seemingly oppositional spaces might be more usefully \nseen as an oblique reflections of the state and political order. \nUrban Insecurities \u2013 \u2018Cairo As Bomb\u2019 \nPortrayals of Cairo as a rebellious mega-city are part of a well-established \u2018Cairo as bomb\u2019 trope  in which \nthe city is represented as perpetually on the verge of conflagration (Singerman & Amar, 2006). It \nencompasses specific incidents of civil disorder including the January 1977 riots against the government \nreduction of consumer subsidies, the February 1986 police-conscript uprising, and (historically) the \nJanuary 1952 \u2018Black Saturday\u2019 attacks on British interests. More generally, Cairo is a mega city, its \npopulation increasing from 2.5 to at least 11 million between the 1950s and 1990s (Bayat & Denis, 2000: \n189 [Table 2.5]). These high rates of growth and the burdens placed on urban infrastructure have struck \nsome contemporary observers as potentially explosive and disastrous (AID, 1978; Joint Housing Team, \n1976). Of course, fears of urban disorder are hardly new. The nineteenth century European elite \nbemoaned the turmoil caused by native street peddlers (Kuppinger 1995). Their Egyptian successors have \nperiodically asserted that Cairo has been over-run by uncivilized migrants from the countryside, \nparticularly from Upper Egypt (Miller, 2006; Waterbury 1978). \nPage 2 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n3 \nNationalist protests on the streets of Cairo were an established, if often largely theatrical, part of the \npolitical landscape in the latter decades of Egypt\u2019s British-dominated constitutional monarchy (Tripp, \n1998). The \u2018Black Saturday\u2019 attacks helped set the stage for the Free Officer\u2019s seizure of power some \nmonths later. Popular protests figured significantly in the consolidation of power by Nasser, Egypt\u2019s first \npresident 1954 and subsequent challenges to his authority in the late 1960s (Waterbury, 1982). Perhaps \nnot surprisingly, Egyptian governments have hence regarded their capital as a \u2018container of political \nmenace\u2019 vulnerable to \u2018mass violence\u2019 which could potentially bring \u2018the nation to a halt\u2019 (Waterbury, \n1982: 327). \nBut such fears also likely reflect the authoritarian character of the nominally republican dispensation of \npower established by Nasser and perpetuated by his successors Sadat and Mubarak. It included the \nconstruction of a bureaucratic Leviathan state apparently capable of the unilateral top-down control of \nthe Egyptian economy and society and a disinterest in democratic bargaining (Owen, 2000; Kassem, 2004; \nVatikiotis, 1968). While dependent on the state security forces for its reproduction, the political order\u2019s \nlong-term durability is also the result of continuing state penetration of the economy, extensive networks \nof devolved patronage, strategic manipulation, and subtle forms of symbolic violence. State officials have \nperiodically stigmatized segments of Egyptian society as a threat to the national community, while always \nattempting to portray themselves as the guardians of its modernist development aspirations (Dorman, \n2007; Long, 2004; Singerman 1999). \nApparent liberalization by Sadat amounted to little more than the construction of a fa\u00e7ade democracy. \nDespite the return to multi-party politics in the national legislature, real power remains in the hands of the \npatrimonial presidency and what might be understood as the Egyptian \u2018deep state\u2019\u2014the military, security \nservices, and bureaucratic elites (Springborg, 1989). They rule atop a broader coalition of dependent \ninterests with preferential access to state distribution and state-created spoils, leaving ordinary Egyptians \nexcluded from both meaningful political participation and preferential access to state largesse \n(Singerrman, 1995; Waterbury, 1989) \nThis authoritarian dispensation is manifest at the level of city governance. The Cairo metropolitan area is \nnot governed as a municipality, but rather fragmented into three administratively autonomous \ngovernorates\u2014Cairo, Giza, and Qalyubiyya (see map)\u2014which are effectively part of the national \nbureaucracy (Sullivan, 1983). Each is headed by a presidentially appointed governor, jobs historically \ngiven to ex-soldiers or policemen (Ino, 1989). Despite a complicated system of local councils ostensibly \nproviding for popular representation and accountability, the governors rule top-down with few bottom-\nup constraints (Ghannam, 2001). Egypt\u2019s rulers have been willing to tolerate token pluralism at the \nnational level, but governorate officials and the ruling National Democratic party have generally blocked \nan opposition presence in these councils (Harders 1998; Herzallah & Hamzawy, 2008). \nThe Egyptian state\u2019s explicitly coercive capacities are also manifest at the local level in a variety of ways. \nFor example, the capital is guarded by a \u2018bewildering array of security forces [that keep] public order\u2019 \nemploying perhaps as many as 100,000 policemen (Rodenbeck, 1998: 277). These include the Amn \nPage 3 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n4 \nMarkazi (Central Security Forces) charged with riot control and often enlisted to support the demolition \nof informal areas and the Shurtat al-Marafiq (Utilities Police), deployed by the governorates to enforce \nbuilding demolition orders and clear informal markets (Ismail, 2006; Springborg, 1989). Moreover, Cairo\u2019s \ndistricting is organized around some 40 police stations. In some cases fortified, they are the most visible \nstate institution in many neighbourhoods\u2014for the most part located in potentially suspect areas (Ismail, \n2000). But there is also room for co-option within this system of power: governorate officials and the \npolice maintain de facto control of particular neighbourhoods through alliances with notable families \n(Ghannam, 2001). \nThe Emergence of Informal Cairo \nIronically given this elaborate architecture of top-down control, Cairo\u2019s rulers have only exercised \nminimal guidance over the city\u2019s expansion since the 1950s. Whether measured in terms of population or \ndwelling units, informal areas housed well over half of the city\u2019s approximately 11 million inhabitants by \n1996 (Sims 2000). Since the 1970s, informal development has probably accounted for at least 80 percent \nof Cairo\u2019s growth (Mayo et al. 1982). \nThe bulk of such development has taken place on privately held agricultural land on the city periphery \n(see map). Informal Cairo does include settlements encroaching on public land, but they represent a \nrelatively small percentage of the informal housing sector (Sims, 2000). The underlying causes of informal \nurbanization have been the city\u2019s high rate of population growth\u2014mainly through the natural increase of \nexisting Cairenes\u2014combined with the absence of new formal subdivisions within which housing could be \nbuilt legally to absorb it. These factors helped drive steady land-price inflation beginning in the mid-1960s \n(Wheaton, 1979). An extensive rent-control system originally intended to curb housing price inflation \nonly exacerbated it (McCall, 1988). Priced out of formal land and housing markets, increasing numbers of \nCairenes bought farmland\u2014the cost of which was stagnating or falling\u2014upon which to build. \nSuch homesteading, however, contravened a host of laws, decrees, and other regulations prohibiting the \nconversion of farmland. As a consequence, the resulting sub-divisions lacked state planning and were, by \nvirtue of their illegality initially denied access to public services such as water and sewerage (Mayo et al., \n1982). In addition to the long-standing fears of disorderly urbanism, Egyptian state agencies nominally \nopposed such developments as encroaching on the country\u2019s relative scarce arable areas and threatening \nfood security. But although strictly speaking illegal, this urbanization is usually described\u2014at least by \nwestern observers\u2014as \u2018informal\u2019, referring to \u2018activities which are not officially noticed through \nregistration and taxation procedures\u2019 (Hopkins, 1991a: 1). In part, this labelling reflects the fact that \nEgyptian state agencies\u2015despite the predilection of authoritarian regimes for urban planning by \ndemolition (Hardoy & Satterthwaite, 1989)\u2015have had little success in curbing such urbanization. \nSome observers see informality is a stepchild of the processes of liberalization and economic austerity \nexperienced (however unevenly) by states like Egypt starting in the 1970s (Yacobi & Schecter, 2006). But \nsuch claims are only partially applicable to the Cairo case. There, the process and logic of informal \nPage 4 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n5 \nurbanization predate economic opening. Development of the Munira area, for example, was well \nunderway by the mid 1960s (El-Sioufi, 1982). But the availability of remittance capital from Egyptians \nemployed in the Gulf and Libya did accelerate its pace from the mid 1970s through the mid 1980s (Sims, \n2003). In Egyptian terms, informal urbanization is best understood as an organic movement of mostly \nnative Cairenes, usually young families, with sufficient capital to build, buy or rent in search of affordable \nneighbourhoods. \nSuch a position should not, however, be read as romanticizing informal urbanization. In the absence \nformal planning, the process often results in sprawling neighbourhoods with extremely high population \ndensities. The absence of state-provided infrastructure soon leads to serious environmental degradation \n(Oldham et al., 1987). The lack of land reserves for roads or other amenities means that such \ncommunities are sometimes characterized by narrow sunless canyon-like streets without intersections (El-\nSioufi, 1982). Finally, informal urbanization may have become part of the broader problem of \nland\/housing price inflation. As such communities mature, they become unaffordable for many young \nfamilies, who will then likely homestead in settlements encroaching on public land and which suffer from \nmore profound service deficits as well as greater tenure insecurity (El Kadi, 1992). \nThe \u2018Islamic Republic of Imbaba\u2019 \nIn general terms, informality \u2018expresses a certain resistance to state control\u2019, seemingly manifest in the \nclose association between informal Cairo and Islamist militants since the late 1970s (Hopkins, 1991b: \n108). While not explicitly raising the issue of informality, Kepel\u2019s (1985) examination of the social \nbackground of Cairo militants arrested in the wake of Sadat\u2019s 1981 assassination noted that they were \nconcentrated in urbanizing settlements on the city periphery. The relationship became even more \napparent towards the end of the 1980s when militants in Upper Egypt relocated to Cairo both in order to \nescape the pressure of state security forces in the south and confront the Mubarak government on its \nhome ground (Hafez & Wiktorowicz, 2004; Mubarak, 1995). \nAn initial confrontation came in 1988 when militants clashed with security forces in the North Cairo \ninformal area of cAyn Shams (cUmar, 1988). By 1992, there were incidents of violence throughout the \nyear in informal neighbourhoods throughout Cairo. Militants not only battled with police but also \nattacked stores alleged to sell alcohol and sexually illicit videos and were accused of fomenting sectarian \ntensions with attacks on Coptic Christians (Denis, 1996). But the climax of Islamist infiltration was in \nMunira Gharbiyya. The Gamaca Islamiyya had entrenched itself, using the neighbourhood as a base from \nwhich to attack the Egyptian state from without. Their urban-guerrilla activities included the assassination \nof public officials and the secular politician Farag Fuda (cAbd al-cAti, 1992; Abdalla 1993). \nFrom within, the militants sought also to create a \u2018counter-society\u2019, a microcosm of their proposed socio-\npolitical order (Sivan, 1987). The Gamaca Islamiyya\u2019s \u2018social work committees\u2019 provided welfare services; \nits \u2018night watch\u2019 secured the streets; and its \u2018reconciliation committee\u2019 mediated disputes (Mubarak, 1995: \n246, 260-263). There was a heavy emphasis on the remoralization of Egyptian society (cAbd al-cAti, 1992; \nPage 5 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n6 \nAbdo, 2000; Mubarak 1995). Militants sought to ban the sale of alcohol and videos, and require women to \nwear the hijab (head scarf). The Gamaca Islamiyya\u2019s imposition of social control\u2014identical to its tactics in \nUpper Egypt\u2014was also said to have found favour with the predominantly Upper Egyptian inhabitants of \nMunira whose \u2018ideas, customs and traditions\u2019 were much the same as those of their brethren in the south \n(Mubarak, 1995: 243). \nThe Mubarak government finally acted against the militants after their ill-advised declaration to a Reuters \ncorrespondent in late 1992 that they had established the \u2018Islamic Republic of Imbaba\u2019 in Munira \nGharbiyya (Abdo, 2000; Singerman, 1999). This claim was perhaps the final straw for the Mubarak \ngovernment in what had been a difficult period for Cairo. Its lethargic response to the October 1992 \nearthquake\u2014which killed 561 and did $1.2 billion in damage in Cairo and elsewhere\u2014provoked furious \ncriticism in the press and some street protests (Brauch 2003; El-Kadi, 1993). Its seeming inability to \nprovide shelter to the affected was in stark contrast to the effective relief given by Islamic organizations, \nunder the direction of the Muslim Brotherhood (Al-Awadi, 2005). Indeed, the resulting popular support \nmay have encouraged militants in Munira to escalate their confrontation with the Mubarak government \n(Singerman, 1999). \nSo the \u2018Siege of Imbaba\u2019 came at the end of a chain of events suggesting that the Mubarak government \nwas losing control of its capital, and more broadly that its long-term survival was threatened by the \ninability to address the country\u2019s chronic socio-economic problems represented by informal Cairo. The \nsuppression the Islamists in Munira was followed by a series of security-force sweeps against suspected \nmilitants elsewhere in the metropolitan area. In the longer term, it sought to re-establish at least the \nappearance of control over its capital. This effort took the form of a series of announcements through the \nspring of 1993 that the Egyptian state would deal decisively with informal Cairo through the \ncomprehensive demolition and upgrading of its settlements (Kuppinger, 2001). \nOn the one hand, Mubarak and his officials declared that approximately sixteen Cairo neighbourhoods \nwere beyond rehabilitation and would hence be demolished (Ibrahim, 1993; Mucawwad, 1993). While the \nclearance list included communities apparently damaged in the earthquake, it did not include any of those \nwhere the government had clashed with the Islamists. On the other, they announced much larger-scale \nplans to upgrade informal communities (Arandel & El Batran, 1997). Roughly eighty neighbourhoods \nwere to be comprehensively serviced, both with basic infrastructure\u2014water, wastewater, and electricity \nconnections\u2014as well as \u2018street-widening, lighting and paving [\u2026] mainly as a security measure meant to \nensure easier control\u2019 (El Batran & Arandel, 1998: 230). \nSuch announcements were made in the context of an unfolding media discourse of social danger\u2014yet \nanother manifestation of the \u2018Cairo as bomb\u2019 trope\u2014in which informal areas were labelled cashwa\u2019iyyat and \nstigmatized. Munira Gharbiyya, according to an Egyptian academic writing in English, had become a \n\u2018Hobbesian world of violence and vice\u2019 (Ibrahim, 1995: 75). While use of the term manatiq cashwa\u2019iyya in \nEgyptian media Arabic predates the Siege, nonetheless its usage shifted increasingly from a descriptive \nlabel for unplanned urbanization to a pejorative objectification of social disorder. \nPage 6 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n7 \nCrude themes within the cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse included the links between the spatial disorder and \ndegraded conditions within informal areas and their consequent social disorder; claims that they were a \nrefuge for criminals and uncivilized rural migrants (often Upper Egyptian); and the assertion that, by \nvirtue of their poverty and marginality, they were breeding grounds for radicalism and terrorism \n(Dorman, 2007). More sophisticated tropes, however, focused on the apparent absence of the Egyptian \nstate. In one account, the Gamaca Islamiyya were able to exploit \u2018the political, social, and security \nvacuum\u2019, caused by the government\u2019s failure both to assert its presence and develop the area (Mubarak, \n1995: 245). Reportage during the siege stressed the need for the state to assert its presence and to deny \nthe Islamists refuge (Al-Ghamri, 1992; Muntasar, 1992). Three years later, a leftist writer asserted that the \narea still remained self-sufficient and detached, hence continuing to defy state authority on an everyday \nlevel (Sulayman, 1997). \nCrucially, the cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse appeared to \u2018securitize\u2019 the issues of informality and urban planning, \njustifying unilateral state intervention (Buzan et al., 1998). Informal neighbourhoods and their inhabitants \nwere depicted as an \u2018uncivilized, almost savage, Other, in need of rehabilitation, education and moral \nguidance\u2019 (Singerman, 1999: 11). They posed an existential threat, not only to Egypt\u2019s immediate health \nand security, but also its aspirations for development (Kuppinger, 2001; Singerman, 1999). In this context, \nsome commentators proclaimed that \u2018clearance is the solution\u2019, urging that state agencies be given the \npower to undertake large-scale demolitions (Shakir, 1993; Muhammad, 1993). On the other hand, \nexplaining the rise of the Islamists in terms of the degradation and backwardness of the informal urban \nenvironment also allowed them and government officials to suggest that the state could re-order such \ncommunities by providing public services. Urban development might rehabilitate the cashwa\u2019iyyat. \nWestern students of informality, schooled in such classic texts as Janice Perlman\u2019s (1976) Myth of \nMarginality, will have little difficulty critiquing the cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse. Indeed, its tropes are decidedly \nunoriginal, reproducing long-standing fears of urban disorder found in the West and elsewhere. A careful \nreading of the broader academic literature on informal Cairo\u2014albeit mostly by western scholars or \nEgyptians in western universities\u2014suggests that these neighbourhoods are neither pathological nor \ndisorderly (Dorman, 2007). Whatever their problems of service deprivation and community cohesion, \nthey are integrated into the broader Cairo metropolitan area on a number of levels. \nYet ironically even this scholarly literature sometimes mirrors the cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse in the claim that \ninformal urbanism reflects the absence of the Egyptian state. Asef Bayat, for example, has argued that the \ninformal sector in Egypt (and elsewhere) is populated by those who desire \u2018to run their own affairs, \nwithout involving the authorities or other modern formal institutions\u2019 (1997: 59). Even more strikingly, \nSalwa Ismail has argued that informal areas in Cairo constitute \u2018spheres of dissidence\u2019 in which Islamist \nmilitants are able to establish themselves by virtue of the areas\u2019 \u2018autonomy, informality and self-regulation\u2019 \n(2000: 364, 389). She viewed the militants as exploiting the illegality and invisibility \u2018inscribed in the \ncharacteristics of the space itself\u2019, for example, the absence of police stations (1996: 125). While certain \nsocial institutions within informal Cairo doubtless do have a degree of autonomy, Bayat and Ismail\u2019s \nPage 7 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n8 \nclaims beg the question of how such autonomy and opposition are possible given the apparently all \nencompassing character of the post-1952 political dispensation. \nConfronting the cashwa\u2019iyyat? \nBut perhaps the most effective critique of the cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse emerges from an examination of the \nEgyptian state\u2019s de facto policy of inaction vis-\u00e0-vis informal Cairo. Upon closer scrutiny, most of the areas \nslated for demolition had not been cleared by the end of the 1990s. Official claims to the contrary \nnotwithstanding, there was also little evidence that informal Cairo had been systematically upgraded. \nWith respect to the sixteen neighbourhoods slated for demolition in 1993, Cairo fieldwork in the late \n1990s uncovered clear evidence of merely three clearances, one of which was only partial (Dorman, \n2007). In the meantime, eight of the areas had been re-designated for upgrading. This research further \nindicated that several of the original sixteen areas had been previously slated for demolition. Their \ninclusion on the 1993 list was not necessarily a sign of state resolve to tackle the pathologies of the novel \ncashwa\u2019iyyat phenomenon, but rather merely the latest a series of attempts by Cairo officials to displace \nareas long deemed undesirable. Where clearances did take place\u2014sometimes in areas not on the \ndemolitions list\u2014the removals often had little to do with informality. Most commonly, informal areas \nwere displaced to make way for public-sector projects\u2014for example major road works (Raymond, 2000; \nSims, 2002). \nOn the infrastructure front, the Mubarak government did build new police stations and undertook the \nshow-piece re-building of Munira Gharbiyya. However, there is less evidence of a more general \nrenovation programme for informal Cairo. The $563 million Fund for the Upgrading of Scattered \nSettlements, announced in early 1993 as the primary funding instrument, was quite limited in per capita \nterms. Much of its money may have been spent on projects of primary benefit to upper-income groups in \nCairo\u2019s more formal areas (Sims, 2003). \nThe ambiguity of Egyptian upgrading efforts is evident in the Munira re-building case. Its show-piece \nupgrading, including a visit from Britain\u2019s Prince Charles, was described in the semi-official press as a \n\u2018model\u2019 for how the state should deal with the cashwa'iyyat (Al-Dib, 1995). Some $90 million paid for \nsewerage, water connections, street lighting, paving, and improved sanitation as well as secondary services \nsuch as schools, a youth centre and clinics (Tadros, 1996). Yet interviews with an Egyptian official in Giza \nand a well-informed western source indicated that the Munira project was the only such effort undertaken \nin urban Giza. Much of the basic infrastructure work, however, had been installed by national agencies \nand not the local authorities. Yet even the provision of water and wastewater service would probably have \nnot been possible without the substantial investments provided by a long-running US Agency for \nInternational Development (AID) sewerage project still underway at the time (Dorman, 2007). Closer to \nhome, the Munira upgrading faced accusations from Egyptian commentators that\u2014apart from paving \nand wastewater\u2014state concern was \u2018superficial\u2019 and the upgrading \u2018nominal\u2019 (Al-Sawi, 1996: 129). Even \nthe semi-official press noted its rather limited scope: nearby settlements still lacked basic utilities (Tadros, \nPage 8 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n9 \n1996). \nSuch evidence suggests that following the suppression of the Islamists, the Mubarak government returned \nto what might be called \u2018neglectful rule\u2019, long-established patterns of inaction that had allowed informal \nCairo to flourish for decades. In the main, little was done to curb its continuing growth. One nominal \neffort, the announcement in 1996 that informal developers would be prosecuted in Egyptian military \ncourts, had been abandoned by 2004 because it was actually encouraging such urbanization (El Hefnawi, \n2005). De facto toleration of informal communities was also accompanied by the state\u2019s inability or \nunwillingness to undertake major infrastructure projects without international funding. While officials did \nrebuff bottom-up demands for servicing, the long-term trend has been for areas to receive local \nconnections eventually\u2014usually the result of a clientelistic micropolitics whereby informal communities \ncultivate ties to state officials and the latter use services (or at least the promise thereof) as means of \ncultivating support (Fahmy, 2004; Kassem 1999; Sims, 2002; Tek\u00e7e et al., 1994). \nNeglect & Complicity \nObservers of Cairene politics therefore  face an interesting puzzle: an apparently pervasive and unilateral \nstate that nonetheless fails to take control of its capital, even after the emergence of virulently \noppositional elements and despite a discourse apparently giving it ample justification for heavy-handed \naction. One possible explanation for the Mubarak government\u2019s neglectful rule of its capital can be found \nat the levels of state capacity and structural constraint. Egypt\u2019s historic underdevelopment\u2014a legacy of an \nessentially mono-crop agrarian economy integrated internationally through cotton exports\u2014has limited \nthe domestic resources for modernization and state building (Barnett, 1992). Specifically, Egyptian \ngovernments since 1952 have lacked the means to plan and service the rapidly growing mega-city \n(Serageldin, 1990). Most importantly, they have been unable to construct sufficient housing to resettle the \nmillions who would be affected by the large-scale clearance of informal Cairo and no government is likely \nto risk large-scale displacements without having alternative shelter available (Kuppinger, 2001; Sims, \n2002). In this view, \u2018neglectful rule\u2019 merely represents the path of least resistance for Egypt\u2019s rulers, given \nthe historic constraints they faced. \nAn interesting implication of the structural constraints argument is that the Egyptian state, post-1952, is \nless a bureaucratic \u2018leviathan\u2019 and more of a \u2018gate-keeper\u2019 (Cooper, 2002). The claim here is that it \nmaintains a modicum of top-down control not through the systematic penetration of society, but rather \nby focusing on strategic nodes of communication and relying on the large-scale use of intermediary \ngroups to rule the urban and rural masses indirectly (Roussillon 1998). It is a tempting argument to make \nbecause it echoes the work of scholars who have looked at the Egyptian state in the rural sector, and \nsimilarly noted its incapacities vis-\u00e0-vis politically sensitive issues such as land reform and support to small \nfarmers (Adams, 1986; Waterbury 1983).The \u2018gate-keeper state\u2019 argument further resonates with efforts to \ntranscend conventional accounts of contemporary Egyptian politics\u2014with their near uniform focus on \nnational-government decision-making\u2014in favour of a more bottom-up approach (Fandy, 1998). \nPage 9 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n10 \nBut whatever the merits of these arguments about limited state capacity, they do not entirely fit the \nempirical case here. The Cairo metropolitan area is just too small to view the Egyptian state as merely a \n\u2018gate-keeper\u2019. Not only are there are police stations situated throughout the city (especially after 1992), \none can usually find some degree of state presence in even the most seemingly forgotten informal \nneighbourhoods. With respect to the resource constraints claim, structural underdevelopment has \ndoubtless constrained the state. But since the 1970s Cairo\u2019s rulers have not faced the city alone. Rather, \nthey have had access to substantial levels of western aid and technical assistance for use in upgrading \ninformal areas, planning the city\u2019s future growth, and renewing basic infrastructure. For example, \nfollowing the January 1977 riots the US Agency for International Development (AID) began a large-scale \nhousing and informal areas upgrading project in Helwan\u2014a southern Cairo industrial suburb (see map)\u2014\nwhere the rioting had started and which had been a flash-point for civil unrest since the late 1960s \n(Dorman, 2007). Around the same time, AID justified its decision to upgrade the Cairo wastewater \nnetwork and end widespread sewage flooding\u2014what would eventually become a $900 million \ninfrastructure programme\u2014in terms of the need to reverse the urban poor\u2019s declining standard of living \nwhich it linked to the 1977 riots (Dorman, 2007). \nBut such urban-development projects were not purely about buying social peace through the provision of \ninfrastructure. They were also intended to foster an administratively competent Egyptian state better able \nto intervene in its capital (Dorman, 2007). Although their implementation has been highly uneven, with \nEgyptian state agencies generally resisting donor efforts to prepare them for more activist urban \ngovernance, these initiatives are nonetheless analytically significant. They strongly suggest that the \nindisputable constraints faced by Cairo\u2019s rulers are not purely a historical (or structural) lack of resources, \nbut also reflect more contemporary and political constraints on state capacity. \nInformality & the Egyptian State \nIndeed, the puzzle of non-intervention in informal Cairo can only be explained fully with the realization \nthat the image, implicit in much of the cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse, of the Egyptian state facing disorderly and \ninsurgent subalterns is misleading. As Elyachar has insightfully observed: \u2018the state cannot always be so \nneatly located outside informality\u2019 (2003: 576). Not only are there numerous linkages, but informal Cairo \nis best understood as a consequence of certain state policies (declared and undeclared), and its top-down \ndispensation since 1952. The existence and durability of the cashwa\u2019iyyat reflects not the absence of the \nEgyptian state, but the very peculiar qualities of its presence. \nNot only does informal urbanization predate the economic opening of the 1970s, it was ironically an \nindirect consequence of the Nasser government\u2019s state-led industrialization efforts of the late 1950s and \nearly 1960s, a project as much about the exigencies of the military autocracy as Egypt\u2019s developmental \nneeds. In order to make resources available for industrialization, his government sought to channel \ncapital, both public and private, out of the housing sector (Harik, 1997). In particular, it failed to create \nnew Cairo sub-divisions\u2014in the way that the city\u2019s northern districts and Heliopolis neighbourhood had \nbeen developed in previous decades\u2014to accommodate the city\u2019s steadily increasing population (Abu \nPage 10 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n11 \nLughod, 1971). While it did build a few new neighbourhoods, such as Medinat Nasr and Mohandisin in \nGiza, these areas were largely for the professional classes and elites (Harik, 1997). Located close by the \nEgyptian military\u2019s major barracks and installations, Medinat Nasr was specifically intended for the officer \ncorps (El Kadi, 1990). Public housing construction was similarly small-scale. Although nominally \ndesignated for low-income Cairenes, it has often functioned as a source of patronage (Abdel-Fadil, 1980; \nHasan 1985; Sims 2000). \nAt the same time, the Nasser government located many of its new public-sector factories on the city\u2019s \nagrarian periphery\u2014the need to protect farmland notwithstanding\u2014rather than in existing industrial \ncentres. Such locations were intended to shield their future workers from the blandishments of the then \nstill influential Egyptian communist movement (El Kadi, 1990). However this spatial dispersal strategy \nalso facilitated subsequent informal urbanization of the surrounding area by installing utilities upon which \nsuch settlements could \u2018piggy back\u2019. Moreover, it also increased local housing needs which the new \ncommunities served by offering shelter to the factory employees (Dames & Moore, 1981; El Kadi, 1990; \nSims, 2003). \nHence two of the essential conditions of possibility for informal urbanization\u2014the absence of new \nsubdivisions at the root of land-price inflation and the economic development of the city periphery\u2014can \nbe shown to have their origins in state policies shaped by the exigencies of authoritarianism. Such \nsettlements are linked to the authoritarian and clientelistic character of state governance in two more \ngeneral ways. First, the complexities and venalities of securing official permission for land development \nhas led many ordinary Egyptians to opt for informality (DeSoto, 1997). Second, there is some suggestion \nthat individual officials have sometimes used their official position to facilitate informal urbanization\u2014for \nexample, \u2018selling\u2019 public land to informal homesteaders\u2014whether simply in return for pay-offs or because \nthey were active participants in the informal development process (El Kadi, 1988; Elyachar, 2003; Sims \n2000). But while it may collapse the view that the cashwa\u2019iyyat are a marginal zone apart from the state, this \nevidence that the Egyptian state has been thoroughly implicated in their genesis does not by itself explain \nthe subsequent absence of state intervention. Nor does it link non-interventionism specifically to the \nauthoritarian dispensation. \nMost immediately, the de facto reluctance to demolish informal neighbourhoods on a large scale in the \nabsence of alternative shelter can be explained as an authoritarian survival strategy of risk avoidance. \nAutocracies predicated on popular demobilization will generally refrain from actions likely to catalyze \nbottom-up contention (Dorman, 2007). In this view, the Mubarak government was unlikely to demolish \nMunira Gharbiyya at the height of its campaign against the Islamists for fear of creating new grievances \nfor the militants to exploit. But the absence of shelter alternatives is not a simple consequence of resource \nlimitations, but rather starkly illustrates the constraints which Egypt\u2019s elite-dominated and exclusionary \ndispensation of power puts on urban management. \nBy the late 1970s, the western aid agencies attempting to assist the Egyptian government in re-planning \nCairo had grasped the linkage between informal Cairo and the metropolitan area\u2019s broader expansion \nPage 11 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n12 \ndiscussed above (Dames & Moore, 1981). They advised the Sadat and Mubarak governments to re-\norientate its north-south growth away from vulnerable farmland towards a more northeast-southwest axis \n(PADCO et al., 1982). With respect housing, they suggested the development of planned and serviced \nsites on the city\u2019s desert periphery which would be sold to would-be informal homesteaders to construct \naffordable \u2018semi-formal\u2019 settlements without the problems of planning, services and farmland \nconsumption (GOPP\/OTUI\/IAURIF, 1983; Tayler & Green, nd). \nBut the Mubarak government baulked at these recommendations for a number of reasons. Not only did \nsuch so-called \u2018state-sanctioned slum building\u2019 offend its modernist principles, many of the proposed \ndesert sites were already planned by the housing ministry and the politically powerful Egyptian military \nfor upper-income development. These agencies effectively blocked the adoption and implementation of \ndonor recommendations (Dorman, 2007). A decade later, these desert sites are the very places where the \nluxurious gated communities have been located. So in the Cairo case, gated communities were not merely \na response to unruly plebeian urbanization, they also obstructed attempts to manage it\u2014occupying the \nland needed to include non-elite Cairenes in the city\u2019s rationally planned growth. This example further \nillustrates the exclusionary character of the political order in which access to formal housing is often a \npreserve of the wealthy and well-connected, and shows specifically how the order constrains the \nprovision of alternative shelter and hence the displacement of informal communities. \nBut such links go beyond Egyptian governments tolerating what they are unable to rollback. There is also \nevidence of their tacit acceptance, and sometimes encouragement, of informal urbanization. With respect \nto agricultural periphery settlements, one account quoted a long-time and highly influential agriculture \nminister in the Mubarak government saying that the state had aligned itself with the interests of such \nhomesteaders in the 1980s (Musaylihi, 1988). More specific cases of official acceptance generally involve \nsettlements\u2014such as Manshiet Nasser and cIzbat al-Haggana (see map)\u2014which encroach on state land. \nAlthough described in the cashwa\u2019iyyat literature as violations of the law, public land-use regulations \nactually allow considerable scope for such occupations (Sims, 2002). Manshiet Nasser, for example, was \noriginally settled by a nearby squatter community which was being displaced to make way for a hospital. \nCommunity leaders negotiated through local parliamentarians, eventually receiving \u2018tacit permission\u2019 to \nestablish the new neighbourhood (Tek\u00e7e et al., 1994: 24). On the city\u2019s eastern periphery, cIzbat al-\nHaggana originated as a encampment for the families of the Camel Corps soldiers prior to 1952 and later \nreceived a degree of official sanction. It housed the construction workers building Medinat Nasr and \nserving nearby military facilities (Sims, 1984; Soliman, 2004). \nSuch acceptance has an obvious logic, yet again indicative of the exclusionary character of the political \norder. The self-help strategies of informal Cairo ironically serve to insulate a political order in which the \nelite have preferential access to state largesse. The settlement of Manshiet Nasser relieved state officials of \nthe likely risks of forcible clearance and the necessity of paying for resettlement. Not only do state \nofficials probably understand that many Cairenes have little option but to homestead informally\u2014a point \nsometimes echoed in the semi-official press\u2014such settlements are an easy means of housing lower-\nPage 12 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n13 \nincome communities at little cost to the state (Al-Mussawar, 1983; Soliman, 1987). Indeed, some western \nobservers have suggested that in Cairo the notion of informality functions largely as a pretext for \nrationing scarce infrastructure (Mayo et al., 1982; Tek\u00e7e et al., 1994). It is thus more generally a means by \nwhich the city\u2019s rulers sidestep the human costs of its inevitable expansion and shield themselves from the \ndemands the city\u2019s growth engenders. Such views appear to be confirmed in the semi-public comments of \nan Egyptian official summarized by Elyachar: \nInformal housing, he explained, was housing for which the state provided no services\u2014water, electricity, \nroads, or lighting. People who build in such conditions enjoyed cheaper prices in exchange for doing \nwithout these services. Those who lived in informal settlements had to provide for themselves, until they \nwere established enough that the state had to recognize them, such as had happened in Manshiet Nasser. \nThose living in informal housing had the right to build, he explained, but not to demand anything from the \nstate (2003: 593). \nThis position, not coincidentally, opens the door to the kind of clientelism in search of public services \nupon which the micro-politics of many Cairo neighbourhoods revolves. It thus links them to the country-\nwide networks of devolved patronage which have long under-pinned the political order. Hence \ninformality, again ironically, allows Egypt\u2019s rulers to achieve a considerable degree of state-society \nintegration by other means\u2014despite a political order grounded in elite privilege. \nConclusion: Explaining the cAshwa\u2019iyyat Discourse \nAt least in Cairo, rapid urbanization has not produced a highly violent and conflictual environment \noutside the control of the state. Instead, neighbourhoods are closely connected to the state both in origins \nand reproduction. In the long term, the \u2018Siege of Imbaba\u2019 has done little to alter the underlying state \norientation of indifference, toleration and tacit approval\u2014as well as the clientelistic politics of service \nprovision\u2014which actually characterizes state-society relations on a day-to-day basis. State interventions \nare constrained not only by limited state capacity, but also a logic of exclusion and privilege\u2014intrinsic to \nEgypt\u2019s post-1952 political order\u2014in which informal settlements are regarded as the path of least \nresistance for the low-income and state agencies develop the formal city almost exclusively for the elite. \nSo these neighbourhoods should not be understood as a disorderly oppositional zone. Rather they are a \nreflection, however oblique, of the political order they seem to confront. \nBut such an interpretation of state-society relations in informal Cairo leaves one remaining question: if the \ntwo are so closely tied together in origin and ongoing relations of complicity, what purpose was served by \nthe highly pejorative cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse? Indeed, it is unclear whether the issue of informality was \ngenuinely \u2018securitized\u2019. Although the cashwa\u2019iyyat were indisputably portrayed as an existential threat and \nthere is little evidence to suggest that the discourse was rejected by any significant section of the Egyptian \npublic, nonetheless the relative absence of securitizing policies or practices makes the application of \nBuzan et al.\u2019s securitization concept problematic. \nThe answer to this last puzzle is probably that the cashwa'iyyat discourse needs to be thought of in terms of \nthe Egyptian state\u2019s broader repertoire of \u2018symbolic violence\u2019, and that the discourse has had a number of \nfunctions\u2014some of which are only indirectly related to the areas it purports to describe. For example, it \nPage 13 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n14 \nmay reflect a degree of authoritarian unease at informal urbanization as an organic bottom-up movement \nfrom within Egyptian society not subject to formal state control (Ghannam, 2001). In the context of \nconfronting the Islamist militants in the early 1990s, it should also be read as an attempt to depoliticize \nthe Islamist political challenge\u2014with its elements of subaltern agency, grass-roots organization, and \nprotest of the status quo\u2014as mere criminality, a product of informal Cairo\u2019s socio-spatial disorder \n(Singerman, 1999). It contributes to the long-term political goal\u2014intrinsic to the post-1952 order\u2014of \n\u2018denying communities the legal right and space and organizational resources to participate in Egyptian \npolitical life\u2019 (Singerman, 1999: 27). \nFinally, the cashwa\u2019iyyat discourse provided the Mubarak government with a means of deflecting the \nincreased public concern with Cairo\u2019s overall well-being that followed the earthquake and clashes with \nmilitants. It served to \u2018spatialize a series of social and political problems\u2019, in effect transferring them \u2018into \nthese [informal] areas, symbolically absolving the rest of the city\u2019 (Kuppinger 2001: 197, 199). In so doing, \nthe discourse provided the Mubarak government in the early 1990s with a means of deflecting the \nincreased public concern with Cairo\u2019s overall well-being that followed the earthquake and clashes with \nmilitants. In short it was a means of scapegoating and obscuring the state\u2019s broader failures of urban \ngovernance. \nPage 14 of 21\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/security-dialogue\nSecurity Dialogue\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n15 \nReferences \n \nAID (US Agency for International Development), 1978.
