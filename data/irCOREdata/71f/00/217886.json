This change\nleft migrants across the former British Empire in an anomalous and\noften disadvantaged position: Indians in South Africa had limited\npolitical rights; the bulk of Indians in Ceylon acquired the nationality\nof neither India nor Ceylon; Indians resident in Burma who did not\n\u2217 This research has been generously funded by the UK\u2019s Arts & Humanities\nResearch Council.

Thus,\nGeneral Ne Win put pressure on Indians to leave Burma in 1962,2\nKenya placed restrictions on the rights of Indians in the late 1960s,3\nand Idi Amin expelled Asians from Uganda in 1972.4 Much less is\nknown, however, about the fortunes of people of non-Indian origin in\nIndia.5 The following pages track the fate of Arabs, Afghans and other\ngroups of Muslim migrants in Hyderabad after this princely state was\nforcibly integrated into the Indian Union in September 1948.\nIn the interregnum between independence and the introduction of\nthe Indian Constitution on 26 January, 1950, the government of India\ntook practical steps to ensure that the actual movement of people\ninto India was restricted.6 This included the introduction of permits\nand, later, passports for those travelling between Pakistan and India.7\nMoreover, shortly after independence Afghans in India were required\nto be in possession of passports.8 In Hyderabad the Military Governor\nand the unelected ministry sought to send many people of non-Indian\norigin to their \u2018home\u2019 countries.\nThis paper tracks the government of India\u2019s plan to repatriate these\nmen and their families and makes three main arguments. First, it\nsuggests that, for India, the shift from empire to nation-state was\n1 Hugh Tinker, \u2018Indians Abroad: Emigration, Restriction and Rejection\u2019 in Michael\nTwaddle (ed.), Expulsion of a Minority: Essays on Ugandan Asians (London: The Athlone\nPress for the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London,1975), pp.15\u2013\n29.\n2 Ibid.\n3 Daniel Rothchild, \u2018Kenya\u2019s Minorities and the African Crisis over Citizenship\u2019,\nRace (London), vol. 9, no. 4 (1968), pp. 421\u201337.\n4 Twaddle, Expulsion of a Minority.\n5 cf.

This meant that the government\nof India\u2019s calculations about its citizens were never confined within the\ncountry\u2019s boundaries. Of course, India was not unique in this respect.\nJust as other historians have suggested, this research argues that the\nfact of migration was central to the process by which the Indian nation\nwas demarcated.9\nHowever, and this is the second argument, formal legal questions\nof citizenship and residency were reliant upon more informal, on the\nground negotiations over the meaning of nationality and the nature of\nbelonging. The shift towards a world of nation-states precipitated the\nemergence of a legal regime governing nationality in former British\ncolonies that often conflicted with precisely those ethnic conceptions\nof belonging that had given rise to the demand for independence\nin the first place. In principle, this new legal framework required\ndocumentary evidence to prove one\u2019s citizenship, including birth\ncertificates and passports, in order to establish the right to enter a\ncountry either for travel or to work.10 Whilst the existing literature\nplaces great stress on the importance of this documentary regime,\nthis paper argues that, in practice, the authorities were heavily\ndependent upon both the self-identification of individuals and the\neveryday understandings of belonging, even for the production of\nthese documents. Thus, this research engages with scholars who have\nnoted the dissonance between a formal rhetoric of secularism and\ninformal attitudes and practices which excluded Muslims from the\nIndian nation.11 It extends this particular question to ask whether\nMuslims of Afghan and Arab origin could hope to retain any sense of\nbelonging in postcolonial India.\n9 Radhika Viyas Mongia, \u2018Race, Nationality, Mobility: a History of the Passport\u2019,\nPublic Culture, vol. 11, no. 3, (1999), pp. 527\u2013535.\n10 This framework had been developing since the nineteenth century.

More recent work has suggested that\neven formally secular legal regimes tended to be structured in ways that served the\ninterests of Hindu men, see, Eleanor Newbigin, \u2018The Codification of Personal Law and\nSecular Citizenship: Revisiting the History of Law Reform in Late Colonial India\u2019,\nEconomic and Social History Review, vol. 46, no. 1 (2009), pp. 83\u2013104.\n84 T A Y L O R C . S H E R M A N\nThird, and finally, the following pages trace the fortunes of individu-\nals who were excluded from India either by informal understandings\nor legal regimes, but who were also excluded from their so-called\n\u2018home\u2019 countries. Many people whom the authorities wished to deport\nwere simply rejected by their home country because they failed to\nfulfil the documentary requirements to prove their citizenship. It\nappears that these men and women were left stateless. But this did\nnot mean that they were rendered helpless or trapped between states.\nOn the contrary, individuals often circumvented immigration controls,\nchanged the way they self-identified for their own ends, and used their\nalien status to try to better their position in India.\nHyderabad and its place in the imperial economy of migration\nNotions of nationality and subjecthood within the British Empire\nhad been a rather untidy tangle of local and imperial rules,12 but in\npractice everyone within the empire (with some important exceptions,\nincluding slaves) enjoyed the freedom to live and work anywhere in\nthe realm. Bolstered by an ideology of free trade and the demographic\nimperative to settle new lands and move labour to where it was\nneeded, the movement of people within the Empire had been largely\nunrestricted for much of the nineteenth century.13 Later, the free\nmovement of certain people within the empire came to be restricted.\nThus, flows of indentured labour from South India were subject to\nmore regulation from the late nineteenth century.14 And the white\ndominions placed restrictions on Asian immigration from the early\ntwentieth century.15 By the late 1930s, some, though not all, British\ncolonies required passports for entry, but their primary purpose was to\nkeep out various classes of \u2018undesirables\u2019, ranging from \u2018prostitutes\u2019\nand \u2018habitual drunkards\u2019 to circus troupes, rather than to restrict\n12 Ann Dummett and Andrew Nicol,Subjects, Citizens, Aliens andOthers: Nationality and\nImmigration Law (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1990); Daniel Gorman, Imperial\nCitizenship: Empire and the Question of Belonging (Manchester: Manchester University\nPress, 2006).\n13 Randall Hansen, Citizenship and Immigration in Post-war Britain: the Institutional\nOrigins of a Multicultural Nation (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 39.

This meant\nthat it was fairly easy to come to live and work on the subcontinent for\nthose who had the financial means to do so.\nHyderabad had long been a desirable destination for migrants from\nthe far reaches of the subcontinent, as well as from Afghanistan,\nthe Arab world and even Southeast Asia. In the late eighteenth\ncentury, Hyderabad became a centre of migration for Arabs from the\nHadhramaut, who worked as soldiers and scholars in the state.19 In the\nearly part of the nineteenth century, the Nizam of Hyderabad provided\nrefuge for Arab, Rohilla, Sikh and Pathan (Pashtun) mercenaries,\nwhom the British wished to expel after the defeat of the subcontinent\u2019s\nmany warring states, including the Marathas.20 Once in Hyderabad\nthese migrants took up various professions, from trade and money-\nlending, to employment in the Nizam\u2019s army, or his special Arab\nirregular forces, the Nazm-i Jamiat, the latter of which exercised\nwatch and ward duties over the palaces of the Nizam and his family.\nHyderabad actively recruited immigrants in some cases. When Salar\nJung I reorganised the Nizam\u2019s administration in the second half\nof the nineteenth century, for example, he brought in talented\nadministrators from North India, many of whom had been educated\nat the Muhammedan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh.21 Hyderabad\n16 For details on the rules in each colony see, Passport Control Manual, 1939,\nIndia Office Records, British Library (hereafter IOR), L\/P&J\/8\/745; Summary of\nVisa Regulations, January 1947, IOR L\/P&J\/8\/745.\n17 Indian Passport Act (XXXIV of 1920), and Passport Rules, 1921, IOR\nL\/P&J\/8\/736.\n18 Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign & Political Department,\nto the Chief Secretary to the Government of Burma, the Chief Secretary to the\nGovernment of NWFP, His Majesty\u2019s Envoy Extraordinary & Minister Plenipotentiary\nat the Court of Afghanistan, and the Agent to the Governor General and Chief\nCommission in Baluchistan, 28 December, 1934, IOR L\/P&J\/8\/736.\n19 Omar Khalidi, \u2018Sayyids of Hadhramout in Early Modern India\u2019, Asian Journal of\nSocial Science vol. 32, no. 3 (2004), pp. 329\u2013345.\n20 Omar Khalidi, \u2018The Hadhrami Role in the Politics and Society of Colonial India,\n1750s\u20131950s\u2019 in Ulrike Freitag and William G.

In addition to these Muslim\nmigrants, the Nizam\u2019s government also welcomed Kamma settlers\nfrom the Telugu-speaking areas of Madras to bring uncultivated lands\nin Telangana under the plough.23 At the same time, migrants did\nnot all move in one direction: a considerable number of weavers left\nthe state in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to settle\nin the main weaving centres of Bombay province where demand for\ntheir goods was higher.24 As a result, Hyderabad had become a rather\ncosmopolitan place: its mixed population was supported by an official\nideology epitomized by Hyderabad\u2019s court and nobility, which were\nfamed for their inclusiveness.25\nThis did not mean that Hyderabad\u2019s population lived in perpetual\nharmony; this mix did suffer occasional crises. Hyderabadis protested\nagainst the entry of outsiders, or \u2018non-mulkis\u2019, into the services after\nSalar Jung I recruited North Indians into the administration.26 In the\n1850s, Arabs were deemed to be a \u2018menace\u2019 for their alleged involve-\nment in money-lending and the violence which often accompanied\nthe collection of loans. Hyderabadi and British authorities combined\nto stem the problem: the British restricted the entry of Arabs at\nthe port of Bombay, and Salar Jung I established a special court\n(Qadat-i Urub) to deal with cases involving Arabs.27 Nearly a century\nlater, after the Second World War, Arabs again found themselves\nunwelcome in the state.

Although Hyderabad was\nnot disconnected from developments in the rest of the subcontinent,\nits politics had not crystallized along religious lines in the way that\nall-India politics did in the months surrounding August 1947. But\nas strife within Hyderabad escalated, the state was drawn into a\ndiscursive interpretation of all-India politics which was dominated\nby the experience of partition.\nHyderabad\u2019s nascent internal politics were fragmented along\nlinguistic, caste and religious lines, but the state\u2019s political divisions\ndid not directly correspond to those in the rest of India. Linguistic\naffinities tended to define the major parties in the state, with separate\norganizations for Kannada speakers and Marathi speakers, whilst\nin the Telugu-speaking areas in the east of the State, the Andhra\nMaha Sabha, with its communist agenda, was the dominant political\nforce. During the war, the communists in Telangana had begun\nan insurgency against landlords and the forces of the Nizam that\ncontinued after 1947.31 For its part, the Hyderabad State Congress\nhad pretensions to unite the entire state, but in effect its three\n28 Extract from a secret note from W.

By 1947 the Hyderabad\nState Congress and the Andhra Maha Sabha were demanding that the\nNizam accede to the Indian Union. But both the main dalit parties, the\nDepressed Classes Association and the Depressed Classes Conference,\nhad declared that they wished to stay out of the Union in order to avoid\nbeing dominated by caste Hindus.\nFinally, there was the Majlis-i Ittehadul Muslimin, which had\nbeen established in 1927 and claimed to represent the interests of\nHyderabad\u2019s Muslim population. At its inception, the Ittehad had\ncriticized the Nizam\u2019s rule, and pushed for more representative\ngovernment, but on the basis that Muslims should rule Hyderabad.\nBy 1947, the party held significant influence over the Nizam. At\npartition, the party supported both the creation of Pakistan and\nthe idea that Hyderabad should stay out of the Indian Union.33 As\ncommunists and nationalists stepped up their own campaigns, the\nIttehad\u2019s paramilitary volunteers, the Razakars, set about realising the\nIttehad\u2019s pro-Muslim agenda with aggression against anyone whom\nthey considered to be an enemy of the regime. Of course, not all\nMuslims were united, let alone united in support of the Ittehad: both\nnationalists and communists counted Muslims amongst their ranks,\nand there had been fighting between members of the Arab Nazm-i\nJamiat and members of the Ittehad.34 These squabbles were the source\nof the attempt to deport Arabs, as cited above. Furthermore, many\ngovernment servants saw the spike in Muslim-chauvinist sentiment\ninspired by the Ittehad and the Razakars as a betrayal, not only of\nHyderabad\u2019s cosmopolitan ethos, but also of Islam.35\n32 Swami Ramananda Tirtha, Memoirs of Hyderabad Freedom Struggle (Bombay:\nPopular Prakashan, 1967), pp. 176\u2013187.\n33 Carolyn M.

The structure of rule in the state, where\na predominantly-Muslim government held power over large numbers\nof the disadvantaged, many of whom were Muslim, but the majority of\nwhom were Hindu, appeared to divide the population along religious\nlines. This was especially so as the Nizam\u2019s forces, who were mostly\nMuslim, descended to suppress the communists and nationalists, the\nbulk of whom were Hindu.\nIn addition, two short-term trends increased the perception in\nNew Delhi that Hyderabad was a state run by Muslims for Muslims.\nFirstly, the Ittehad and the Razakars, who wished Hyderabad to avoid\naccession to the Indian Union consciously remoulded Hyderabad\u2019s\nimage into that of a Muslim State. They attempted to recruit men from\nacross the Muslim world to fight to protect Hyderabad\u2019s \u2018Muslim State\nagainst the invasion of Hindus\u2019.36 According to Indian Government\ndocuments, former members of Hyderabad\u2019s army were sent to\nAfghanistan and to Pakistan\u2019s North West Frontier Province (NWFP)\nto recruit forces to protect the state.37 In turn, the government of\nBombay refused entry to men from the Frontier and the Hadhramaut\non the ground that they were expected to travel to Hyderabad in\norder to enlist in the Nizam\u2019s forces.38 Secondly, thousands of Indian\nMuslims sought the protection of the Nizam during the violence\nof partition. The Nizam\u2019s Palace in New Delhi was used to house\nmore than 1,500 Muslims who had sought shelter from the violence\nwhich engulfed the capital in September 1947.39 And several hundred\nthousand Muslims left India and established themselves in Hyderabad,\nespecially in Hyderabad City.40\n36 D.

S H E R M A N\nAs the Nizam\u2019s forces bore down more heavily on their opponents in\nHyderabad, and non-Hyderabadi Muslims gathered in the state, the\nterritory was drawn into an all-India narrative of partition. Although\neach locality, indeed, each person, experienced partition in a unique\nway, as Pandey has shown, these separate instances of violence were\noften given larger significance as they were transposed into events of\nnational suffering. Thus, individual acts of violence became national\nwrongs and entire communities were rendered undifferentiated and\nsuspect.41 The catastrophe of partition produced a postcolonial polity\nin which political parties organized around Muslim interests were\nalmost completely discredited, and the loyalty of Muslims in India\nwas easily cast in doubt. These views informed the government of\nIndia\u2019s treatment of Muslims who wished to return to or remain in\nIndia after partition.42 They also shaped the treatment of Muslims\namongst communities of overseas Indians in the remaining British\ncolonies, including Kenya.43 They certainly coloured interpretations\nof the situation in Hyderabad, for the government of India concluded\nthat the unrest in Hyderabad threatened to destabilize \u2018the communal\nsituation in the whole of India\u2019, and decided to invade the state to\nrestore order.44 On 12 September, 1948, therefore, the government\nof India launched its \u2018Police Action\u2019 in Hyderabad. In spite of the\nname, the move really entailed a full scale military invasion of the\nstate. Although the formal invasion was concluded very quickly, the\nstate witnessed widespread anti-Muslim violence in its aftermath.\nThe official view of Afghans, Arabs and Pakistanis\u2014Razakars\nand outsiders\nThe fact that Hyderabad had been woven into that all-India partition\nnarrative by September 1948 was important because it informed the\nway the government of India and the Military Governor in Hyderabad\nviewed questions of belonging in the state after the invasion.

N. Chaudhuri led Indian troops into the territory. As\nMilitary Governor, Chaudhuri wanted to rid the state of non-\nindigenous Muslims. There was a remarkable absence of debate in\ngovernment over whether this policy was legally permissible. Indeed,\nin the lack of legal clarity which prevailed at the time, the idea that\nnon-indigenous Muslims may have had rights to residence or even\ncitizenship in India was not raised. Instead, everyday understandings\nof belonging determined the fate of these men and their families.\nSuspicion of Muslims dominated the Military Governor\u2019s policy\nfrom the inception of the occupation. As they swept into the state,\nChaudhuri\u2019s forces arrested thousands of people: the Nizam\u2019s military\nforces were detained as they surrendered, and approximately 17,000\ncivilians were imprisoned on suspicion that they were engaged in\nanti-Union activities. Chaudhuri explained, \u2018Naturally, among those\narrested, the majority were Muslims . . . They had been pointed out as\nRazakars by people who were, at that time, considered reliable\u2019.45 In\nthe post-invasion lexicon, the term Razakar did not necessarily denote\nonly those who were members of the volunteer corps. Rather, it was\nwidely used to describe anyone suspected of Muslim chauvinism or\nof opposition to the integration of Hyderabad into the Indian Union.\nAs Chaudhuri\u2019s observation makes clear, it was widely assumed\u2014\nincorrectly\u2014that most Muslims were Razakars.\nBy one non-official estimate, as many as 25,000 Arabs were jailed\nin the aftermath of the invasion.46 A separate non-official source\nsuggested that around 2,500 Afghans were also held.47 According\nto government figures around 6,22548 people described as \u2018Pakistani\nnationals\u2019, who had worked not only in the Nizam\u2019s forces but as petty\ntraders, shopkeepers, money-lenders, masons and mechanics, were\nalso detained in various camps around the State.49 The latter is a\nparticularly curious category given that the legal regime regarding\n45 J.

S H E R M A N\nnationality was anything but clear at this time. The Military Governor\nargued that it was \u2018absolutely necessary to get rid of the Pathan\nand Arab outsiders in Hyderabad as quickly as possible\u2019.50 His\nGovernment, in co-ordination with the central government, decided\nto deport these men to their countries of origin. By one estimate there\nwere around 21,000 people to be deported,51 and most would have\nto be kept in detention camps until they could be escorted from the\ncountry.\nAs they were awaiting deportation, their families were also detained.\nAt this time, women and children under the age of 16 did not have\nseparate rights of nationality or domicile in international law. Instead,\ntheir rights were legally bound to those of their husband or father.\nThus, the government made plans to deport the Indian-born wives\nand children of these migrants. In the meantime, the men and their\nfamilies were held in detention camps, behind barbed wire and under\narmed guard.52 Within a short time, many in the camps had spent\nall their ready cash and were in dire straights. One group of former\nmembers of the Nizam\u2019s forces who were waiting to be sent to Pakistan\nlamented that, \u2018We have no clothes to cover ourselves and we have\nno money to look after the other personal necessaries of life\u2019. They\ndecried the conditions of the camp, writing, \u2018The ladies are in a\nvery depressed state and shocked at their imprisonment in a barbed-\nwire fence and separated from their husbands. . .The future of our\nchildren is being ruined recklessly, as we are unable to educate them.\u201953\nChaudhuri, acknowledging the poor conditions in the camp, told the\nCentre, \u2018morale in Dhond camp [is] extremely low\u2019, and he urged the\ngovernment of India to expedite the removal of the detainees.54\nAs it became clear that Indian forces had acted with excessive zeal in\ndetaining these Muslims on the assumption that they were Razakars,\nnew rationales were developed for their detention and removal from\nthe state. Writing of the Afghans, Chaudhuri stressed the fact that,\n50 Foreign New Delhi to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, 14\nOctober, 1948, NAI, MoS, f.175-H\/48.\n51 Southern Command Adm.

The Military\nGovernor was willing to acknowledge that, \u2018Though perhaps a greater\nproportion of them did not take much part in the Razakar movement\u2019,\nhe nonetheless insisted that, \u2018some of them definitely did, while\nothers naturally used the Muslim domination obtaining at the time\nfor their own ends. As a result, they were possibly not the most\npopular community in Hyderabad\u2019.55 Even this new rationale\u2014their\nunpopularity as moneylenders\u2014was not based on solid evidence, as\nmany Afghans were in fact businessmen and landholders.56 Similarly,\nthe Government in Delhi justified the removal of Arabs on the grounds\nthat, after having lost their jobs as the Nizam\u2019s forces were disbanded,\nmany Arabs were unemployed, \u2018without any means of livelihood and\nwith no prospect of future employment\u2019. This, they reasoned, \u2018would\nconstitute a constant threat to the law and order position in the\nstate\u2019.57\nThe legal rights of those being held awaiting deportation were\nunclear as the legal regime establishing citizenship and domicile rights\nwas in flux in the subcontinent, especially for individuals residing\nin princely states. Before the introduction of the Constitutional\nprovisions regarding citizenship on 26 November, 1949 (two months\nbefore the rest of the constitution) the old British Nationality and\nStatus of Aliens Act continued to apply in independent India, ensuring\nthat those in the former territories of British India remained British\nsubjects after the British had departed.58 The residents of princely\nstates, however, had not been British subjects, but rather, had been\nBritish Protected Persons. They were, therefore, not covered by the\ninterim arrangements made for British India. When British suzerainty\nover the princely states terminated on 15 August, 1947, residents of\nprincely states ceased to be British Protected Persons. The government\nof Hyderabad did issue its own passports for a very brief time between\nindependence and the police action, but these were not recognized\n55 J. N. Chaudhuri to N. M.

It\nwas not until the Citizenship Act of 1955 that persons belonging\nto princely states were formally made citizens of India.60 The court\ncases that retrospectively clarified what status individuals had before\nthe commencement of the constitution or the introduction of the\nCitizenship Act were not heard until as late as 1955,61 meaning that\nin the period immediately after the police action, the legal status of\nthe people of Hyderabad, including those in detention, was uncertain.\nAt this stage, therefore, formal legal rules about who had the\nright to stay in India were less significant than ad hoc notions about\nwho belonged in India. In the reasoning of Chaudhuri and the central\ngovernment, it was easy to slide from more narrow considerations of\ncitizenship and residency, which centred on the question of loyalty, to\nthe idea that persons\u2014or to be accurate, Muslims\u2014who were involved\nin certain professions or who were unemployed did not belong in India.\nMoreover, this understanding was collective: at this stage, there was\nno assessment of the merits of individual Afghans or Arabs\u2014they were\njudged as a whole.\nThese ad hoc assessments were, however, open to negotiation.\nRepresentatives of the Arabs who were detained argued that they\ndid not deserve to be imprisoned or deported. They produced evidence\nthat Arabs, too, had been victims of Razakar attacks before September\n1948, and that they had condemned the excesses of the Razakars and\nMajlis-i Ittehadul Muslimin.62 The Nazm-i Jamiat, they protested,\nhad not engaged in the same activities as the Nizam\u2019s other forces,\nbut had \u2018served the good cause of the public without any distinction\nof caste or creed.\u201963 And they asked to be given a status analogous to\nthat of Indians in South Africa. Largely with the help of General El\nEdroos, head of the Hyderabad Army, who was himself of Arab origin,\nChaudhuri was persuaded to allow Arabs \u2018who have settled down\n59 S.

This,\ntoo, had less to do with rights of residence or citizenship than with an\ninformal understanding between two military men.\nRepatriation and reciprocity\nThe Indian Government had originally proposed that detainees\nbe repatriated to their \u2018home\u2019 states without consultation with\nthe governments of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia\nor Aden. But the detention and proposed deportation raised\nthe prospect that any action to dispel these people would have\nunpleasant consequences for Indian communities overseas. Scholars\nhave remarked upon the fact that the Congress and the government\nof independent India, which the party led, seemed willing neither\nto completely abandon nor unconditionally accept overseas Indians.65\nThe government of India ensured that commissioners were stationed\nin British colonies with significant Indian populations, a move which\nimplied that it was unwilling to relinquish the influence it held over\nthese Indians abroad.66 And yet, Nehru personally urged overseas\nIndians to take the citizenship of the place where they resided, and\nwarned them that they should not expect aid from \u2018Mother India\u2019.67\nUnable to absorb more people after the influx of refugees from\npartition, the government of India was eager to ensure that Indians\noverseas did not have any reason to return. The presence of Indians\noverseas, therefore, forced the government to rethink questions of\nbelonging in India itself.\nThere were clear indications in the press that the security of\nIndians overseas may have been imperilled if Arabs and Afghans were\nforcibly deported from Hyderabad.

The paper asked the Commission to allow\nthe Arabs in Hyderabad to live \u2018in the same way as the Hindus do\nin Aden\u2019.69 The implication was that the fate of the two immigrant\ngroups was tied, and that if Arabs were expelled from Hyderabad,\nHindus may be forced to leave Aden.\nSeeing the displeasure which the prospect of deportation had\nincurred abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fretted that forced\nrepatriation without consultation would be \u2018bound to strain the\nrelations\u2019 between India and these other governments. Above all,\nthe position of Indians in South Africa was a \u2018very important\nconsideration\u2019, according to the Ministry of External Affairs:\nThere is open talk in South Africa now of the repatriation of persons of\nIndian origin to India. If the Government of India were to resort to a forced\nrepatriation of a large number of persons of non-Indian origin without any\nreference to the Governments of the countries concerned, it is bound to be\nquoted as a precedent against us in any future protest against repatriation\nof Indians from South Africa.70\n68 Translation of cutting from Afghan (Karachi), 11 February, 1949, NAI, MoS,\nf.12(4)-H\/49.\n69 Translation of letter addressed to the Commission for the Bharat Government\nin Aden, Al Nahda, enclosed in a letter from A.

Of course, historians\nhave long remarked upon the fact that notions of citizenship in\nIndia were shaped by the experience of partition and the creation\nof Pakistan. But the present research suggests that, although the\ngovernment of India had an ambivalent relationship with Indians\nabroad, it was unable to ignore them when considering questions of\ncitizenship and domicile within India. Because the treatment of aliens\nis so often reciprocal in international law, the presence of Indians\noverseas affected the treatment of non-Indians within India\u2019s borders.\nNegotiating citizenship\nNegotiated deportation, in turn, ran into difficulties because it took\nplace in the midst of a larger transition. The era of decolonization\nwitnessed the inception of a shift from an imperial regime, in\nwhich persons could move relatively freely within the British Empire\nwithout much documentation, to an international one that demanded\nindividuals provide documentary evidence to prove their citizenship.\nBut the emerging legal framework for governing nationality did\nnot square neatly with equally contemporary, but not necessarily\ncomplementary, conceptions of nationality based on ethnicity. This\nmeant that persons who identified themselves (or were identified\nby others) as Arab or Afghan did not necessarily meet the legal\nrequirements to be recognized as nationals of their \u2018home\u2019 countries.\nLegal questions were not the only hurdle: the attempt to remove these\n\u2018outsiders\u2019 also foundered on the government of India\u2019s larger political\nconcerns, especially the struggle over Kashmir.\nNegotiations over repatriating Afghans in Hyderabad quickly turned\non the tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. As soon\nas the Ministry of External Affairs broached the subject of sending\nAfghans home, the Afghan Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in Delhi warned the\ngovernment of India against creating \u2018a sense of injustice\u2019 rankling in\nthe minds of Afghans in Hyderabad. The Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires reminded\nthe Ministry of External Affairs that Afghanistan did not wish its\nown nationals to interfere in Kashmiri affairs, but those deported\nwould have to pass through Pakistan to get to Afghanistan, and \u2018if\nthey were to leave Hyderabad in an angry and disgruntled mood they\n98 T A Y L O R C . S H E R M A N\nwould become a prey to Pakistan propaganda\u2019.71 Given the role that\nPashtun tribesmen from NWFP in Pakistan had played in escalating\nthe Kashmir conflict, the government of India was particularly keen to\navoid the possibility of adding Afghans to those fighting in Kashmir.72\nThe Afghan government agreed that men who had been in the Nizam\u2019s\nforces and \u2018who had obviously no means of livelihood\u2019 ought to be\nreturned, but asked \u2018for special consideration for Afghan nationals\nwho had been coming to and living in India for scores of years\u2019 to be\nallowed to continue to ply their trades.73\nIndeed, as a sign of his goodwill, the Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires travelled\nto Hyderabad to inform Afghans there, \u2018about the true relationship\nbetween India and Afghanistan, and to emphasize what benefits\nAfghanistan was receiving from India and generally to persuade\nthem to behave themselves\u2019.74 In return, the Afghan Government\npersuaded the government of India to significantly alter its plans. As\na result, it adopted a policy of releasing all those Afghans \u2018who were\nwell off and against whom there was nothing specific\u2019.75 It allowed\nAfghans being held in camps to return to Hyderabad, and decided\nnot to deport any Afghans from the State except ex-servicemen, those\n\u2018involved or convicted in Razakar activities\u201976 and those \u2018of undesirable\ncharacter\u2019.77\nChaudhuri, acting as Military Governor, was adamant that this\nmuch smaller group should be removed from the State, and asked\ndistrict police to draw up lists of those to be deported. In total,\nvarious police authorities recommended that 30 Afghan families be\nsent to Afghanistan. However, upon enquiry it was found that, \u2018most\nof the so-called Afghani-Afghan families have been resident in this\nState for several generations and that all their present members\n71 Note by K.

Given that many had\nbeen born in Hyderabad, they could claim Indian citizenship rights\nunder the Constitution. In light of this, the government of Hyderabad\nconcluded, \u2018Though they may all be of Afghan origin, it will not be\npossible to give satisfactory proof of their Afghan nationality to the\nAfghan Government.\u2019 As a result, only five out of 30 families could be\nforcibly repatriated.79 However, on further enquiry it was found that\nno member of these remaining five families was in possession of \u2018any\npassport or other travel documents\u2019.80 The government of India asked\nthe government of Afghanistan if they would accept these families,\nbut received no reply.81\nSimilar difficulties arose when it came to sending Arabs back to\ntheir countries of origin. Around three dozen of the Arabs detained in\na camp in Hyderabad city claimed to be from Saudi Arabia. The Saudi\nauthorities initially refused to issue the necessary identity certificates\nto these men and their families. After General El Edroos intervened,\nthe Saudis were persuaded to issue certificates to 13 of them,82 but\ndeclined to recognize the rest. The Saudi\u2019s contended \u2018that a mere\ndeclaration by the Arabs that they are Saudi Arabians is not enough to\nallow their entry into the country.\u2019 They averred that, \u2018The mere ex-\nistence of a relative in Saudi Arabia does not imply that the applicants\nthemselves are Saudi Arabs\u2019.83 They insisted on \u2018more concrete proof\u2019\nto establish their claim to Saudi nationality. The remaining men were\nunable to provide such proof, and the government of Saudi Arabia\nrefused to allow them entry, even on compassionate grounds.84\n78 L. C.

S H E R M A N\nFinally, around 70 Arabs, most of whom had been in the Nazm-i\nJamiat and were detained in Hyderabad, reported that they wished to\nbe repatriated back to Indonesia, but this proved no simple task either.\nOnly 14 of these Arabs had a valid Dutch passport, while another 33\nhad an expired one. Another 28 people, did \u2018not possess any passport or\ntravel document issued by the Dutch\u2019.85 India did not expect the Dutch\ngovernment to oblige their request to consider taking in these men\nand their dependents, as the government of India had lent its support\nto Indonesian nationalists in their fight against Dutch colonialism.86\nMoreover, the fact that many of the Arabs in Dutch Indonesia had also\nsided with the Republic would not have provided any more impetus\nfor the Dutch to let them return.87 The Dutch government stalled\nbehind requirements for paperwork, and none of the Arabs had been\nsent to Indonesia by the time the Dutch recognized the independence\nof the Republic of Indonesia at the end of 1949. When the new\nIndonesian government considered their subsequent applications for\nIndonesian passports, they found that many of those being deported\nhad written on their application forms that their nationality was \u2018Arab\nMohamadan\u2019.88 Thus, the Indonesian Embassy replied, \u2018It is evident\nfrom the forms that they are neither Indonesians nor Indonesian-\nArabs, but they are definitely Arabs. Therefore the question of giving\nthem Indonesian passports and repatriating them to Indonesia by my\nGovernment, does not arise at all\u2019.89 Indonesia did, however, consent to\nlet these individuals apply for visas, if Hyderabad would issue identity\ncertificates for them.\nThese three examples tell us two things about the regime of legal\ncitizenship based on documentary evidence.

Thus, understan-\ndings of citizenship as a legal right gained by residency and established\nthrough written records contained within them conceptions of\nnationality that relied on ethnic origin as a marker of belonging and\noften directly conflicted with the requirements of the legal regime.\nWhen individuals self-identified in a way that did not match legal\nrequirements, as in the case of the men who identified themselves\nas \u2018Arab Mohamadan\u2019, individuals could be left stateless. Indeed, the\ncombination of documentary requirements for citizenship, and the\nfailure of state borders to map perfectly onto imagined nations, had\nthe potential to leave tens of thousands of migrants stateless.\nIndeed, many of those whom the government of India had wished to\ndeport had no \u2018home\u2019 to be sent to, at least not in law. Thus, very few of\nthe \u2018undesirable\u2019 Afghans were deported. Similarly, after nearly three\nyears of negotiations with the Saudi government, around two dozen\nmen who claimed to be from Saudi Arabia could not be sent home.\nThe government of Hyderabad was left to conclude, \u2018the presence of\nthese 23 persons in Hyderabad is not going to make any difference\nto the state.\u2019 And they too were released from detention.90 Another\n27 Arabs from Indonesia were also freed when their deportation\ncould not be arranged.91 Thus, although the government originally\nestimated 7,000 Arabs would be deported, less than 2,000 Arabs were\nformally repatriated.92 Several thousand were left to either resettle in\nHyderabad or make their own way out of India.\nSelf-identification and subversion\nAlthough many were unable to fulfil the legal requirements to prove\nthe nationality they claimed, and were technically stateless, this did\nnot mean that they were unable to move.

Their eventual departure from India, however, relied\nupon strategic neglect from India\u2019s governments. Interestingly, the\nauthorities in India seemed willing to subvert the system in order to\nfacilitate the departure of these men and their families. Thus, in some\ncases detainees were released from camps and allowed to disappear.\nIn other cases, government officers turned a blind eye to individuals\nwho changed the way they self-identified in order to leave India. The\ncreative negotiation of nationality was not limited to those who wished\nto leave India. Indeed, many of those who remained used their status\nas non-Indians to gain access to privileges within India.\nMany migrants simply slipped through or were allowed to evade\nIndia\u2019s none-too-tight immigration controls. Thus, it was reported that\nby the time Indonesia rejected their visa applications, around half of\nthe original population of Arab Indonesians had \u2018proceeded to Aden\nand Java of their own accord\u2019.93 Indeed, several hundred Arabs made\ntheir way from Hyderabad to Aden on their own initiative, often by\nhitching a ride in boats used for the import of dates.94 The government\nof India was not unaware of their travel. Indeed, the government\nreportedly issued them with \u2018a passport of sorts\u2019 which, it was ordered,\nwould \u2018be accepted for exit only\u2019.95 Here officials in India actually\nhelped aliens to circumvent immigration controls. This takes us back\nto the idea that informal understandings of belonging, as opposed to\nthe strict enforcement of legal rights, were crucial in determining the\nultimate ethnic mix of Hyderabad and India.\nOthers who could not be deported simply changed the way they\nself-identified to their own advantage. For example, the government\nof Hyderabad wished to send several thousand Arabs to either the\nEastern Protectorate or the Western Protectorate of Aden, but the\nBritish authorities in Aden demurred.96 Their objections were less\nconcerned with legal niceties and more with material scarcity, as the\nEastern Protectorate was suffering a severe famine at the time.

He asked, therefore, that India delay\nsending anyone to the Eastern Protectorate until the arrival of the\nmonsoon eased the food situation.97\nHyderabad\u2019s Government was extremely eager to get these people\noff their hands, given that they were being held in camps at\ngovernment expense.98 The government of India, therefore, prepared\na boat of 500 passengers to be sent to the Western Protectorate in\nMarch 1949. When they docked, however, 390 proved to be from the\nEastern Protectorate. Worse still, \u2018almost all the Hadramis who made\nup the bulk of the total are from the famine stricken areas\u2019.99 When\ncalled upon to explain himself, Chaudhuri pleaded ignorance in the\ncase, writing that, \u2018under the previous regime in Hyderabad very few\nrecords exist regarding such Arabs and in many cases, information has\nto be taken from the Arabs themselves\u2019. He assured the government\nof India that the military authorities had been \u2018thoroughly satisfied\nwith the statements of the persons concerned that they belong to\nthe Western Protectorate\u2019.100 Given the sudden rise in the number\nof Arabs on their rosters who claimed to be from the Western\nProtectorate, it is not beyond reason to assume that the Indian\nauthorities were complicit in this stratagem.\nThe flexibility of self-identification did not work so well for persons\nbeing sent to Pakistan, however. Many of those detained as \u2018Pakistan\nnationals\u2019 were in fact Muslims from India, who had given their\ndestination as Pakistan when they were arrested.101 The government\nof Pakistan sent an officer to the camp at Dhond in Bombay Province to\nassess the claims of individuals there to Pakistani nationality.

They,\ntoo, were left to obtain a permit to migrate to Pakistan on their own.104\nThose who were willing to remain in India, who numbered several\nhundred, were returned to their homes. But this did not necessarily\nend the ordeal for them.

Others, like the Pashtuns\nwho originated from NWFP, used their roots to profess loyalty to India\nand assert their rights.\nIn one case, Ghulam Jan Khan asked the Afghan Embassy to help\nhim secure compensation for property damaged in a riot in 1951. The\nauthorities in Hyderabad found, however, that he had \u2018been living in\nHyderabad since his birth and his forefathers had been in this State for\nmore than a hundred years. It was only a year after the Police Action in\nHyderabad that he, somehow, succeeded in obtaining a passport from\nthe Afghan Embassy and declared himself a non-Indian and an Afghan\nNational\u2019.106 In this case, Mr Khan attempted to acquire non-Indian\nnationality in order to gain privileges inside India that could only be\naccessed through pressure from a foreign government.\n102 S.

Once arrested, these\nmen often found that their movable property was looted and their\nimmovable property illegally occupied. Mr Khan conceded that\nHyderabad\u2019s Military Governor, Major General J. N. Chaudhuri\nwas \u2018ever ready to help us\u2019, but alleged that, \u2018local officers do not\nco-operate with us and sometimes treat us with contempt\u2019. He asked\nthe Afghan Ambassador to see to it that the Indian government \u2018deal\nwith us fairly\u2019.107 The Royal Afghan Embassy took up the question of\nthe arrests and the stolen and occupied property with the government\nof India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs. The government of Hyderabad\nissued a blanket denial of the general accusations:\nIt is incorrect to say that Afghan nationals in Hyderabad are receiving\ntreatment any different to that accorded to other citizens. The life and\nproperty of Afghans in Hyderabad are safe and the Administration is making\na special point regarding their welfare.\nHe reiterated that \u2018the majority of Afghans\u2019 in Hyderabad were\nmoneylenders, and therefore unpopular. He suggested that this may\nexplain why false accusations had been made against them.108 The\nquestion of belonging was not just a question of government policy:\nAfghans were allowed to stay, but officers on the ground and other\nmembers of the population had their own understanding of who\nbelonged, and could make life difficult for non-Indians who wished to\nstay. Certainly, this quotidian understanding of citizenship was tied\nup in being Muslim. The fact that these people were doubly marked as\n\u2018outsiders\u2019 may have emboldened their foes to try to get them arrested\nand sent away.\nA final example will serve to demonstrate the ways in which these\nresidents expressed their loyalty in order to assert their rights.\nWhen a group of Pashtuns formed a \u2018Pakhtoon Jirga\u2019 and asked\nthe Collector at Aurangabad to help them secure compensation for\nlosses suffered during the post-police action unrest, they argued:\n\u2018That their kith and kin . . . took an active part in the War of\nIndependence of India, by their whole-hearted support, helpless\n107 Abdul Karim Khan Vakil, Afghan National, Nampalli Chaman, Hyderabad Dn,\nto Sardar Najibullah Khan, Afghan Ambassador to India, 3 May, 1949, NAI, MoS,\nf.10(37)-H\/49.\n108 J.

S H E R M A N\nsacrifices, in the movement of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan\u2019. This\nframed their appeal so as to profess their collective loyalty to\nIndia. They then assured the authorities that \u2018local Pathans never\ntook an active part in the political activities whatsoever and . . .\nalways remained as loyal subjects and thus enjoyed the confidence\nof the Congress\u2019. This positioned the group within the new, more\nrestrictive, limits of Muslim politics in post-partition India. As\nthe idea of political parties for Muslims lost legitimacy with the\nformation of Pakistan, loyalty to the Congress, and, moreover,\na willingness to abandon all active participation in politics, was\nthe surest way to please India\u2019s new rulers. Finally, the Pakhtoon\nJirga pointed to the contribution its members had played in\ncommerce, trade and agriculture, arguing that they had \u2018always\nproved as an asset to the Hyderabad State\u2019.109 This suggests that\nin quotidian understandings of the right of residency and therefore\nrights of access to government services such as compensation\nand restoration of property, it was understood that these rights\nwere dependent upon the perceived utility and loyalty of entire\ncommunities of people. People of non-Indian origin thus found ways\nof asserting their rights which used their status as outsiders to their\nadvantage.\nConclusion\nParticularly in the years before the introduction of the Constitution,\ninformal understandings of belonging were more influential than\nthe enforcement of legal rights in determining whether non-Indian\nMuslims could be citizens or residents of India. The question of\nbelonging was intimately tied to the experience of partition, even in a\nterritory like Hyderabad which was not directly split in the division of\nthe subcontinent. Whilst Hyderabadi politics did not parallel those in\nnorth India which produced the partition, Hyderabad was nonetheless\nviewed through the discursive lens of all-India polarization produced\nby partition. Thus Indian Muslims were rendered parenthetical\ncitizens\u2014\u2018Indian citizens (Muslims)\u2019\u2014because their presence in India\ndisrupted the narrative of partition in which religious affiliation and\n109 Members of the Pakhtoon Jirga, Hyderabad, to the Collector, Aurangabad, 20\nJanuary, 1951, NAI, MoS, f.17(9)-H\/51.\nM I G R A T I O N A N D B E L O N G I N G I N H Y D E R A B A D 107\nnational loyalty were merged. Muslims who were not of Indian origin\nwere doubly marked as outsiders.\nNonetheless, these everyday notions of citizenship could come into\nconflict with formal rules regarding nationality. In the transition\nto a global system in which mobility was more closely regulated,\ngovernments became more reliant on legal and documentary proof\nof nationality. When Afghans and Arabs and Pathans were unable to\nsupply the proof required by their \u2018home\u2019 governments, they appeared\nto be trapped between a legal regime with requirements they could not\nsatisfy and everyday understandings of belonging which would exclude\nthem from India.\nBecause the legal regime was reliant upon self-identification,\nhowever, most of the men and their families had more freedom to move\nthan might be expected. Indeed, the creative use of self-identification\nhelped many to leave India if they so desired. Interestingly, officials in\nIndia proved willing to either bend the rules or to strategically neglect\nthem in order to help get these men and their families out of the\ncountry. This implies that informal conceptions of belonging could, at\ntimes, have significant influence over government action.\nThose Muslims of non-Indian origin who did stay found new ways\nto assert their rights and to profess their loyalty in India. Some\nused their status as foreigners to raise the profile of their claims\nagainst Indian authorities. Others, like the Pakhtoon Jirga mentioned\nabove, exhibited notions of belonging which were bound neither\ngeographically nor demographically by the borders of the Indian state.\nIndeed, this research suggests that the more bounded ideal of the\nnation stalled on its way to ascendance. The strategic alliance with\nAfghanistan over Kashmir ensured that the government of India\ncould not deport many Afghans. International obstruction ensured\nthat Arabs who could not be formally deported and who did not wish\nto make their own way out of India would remain. As a result the\nethnic mix of Hyderabad (and therefore India) was more diverse than\nhad been originally envisioned in 1948. The presence of migrants and\nthe fact of migration ensured that the government of India had to\naccept the presence of people of non-Indian origin in India, even as\ntheir domestic calculations had to incorporate Indians overseas.\n"}
