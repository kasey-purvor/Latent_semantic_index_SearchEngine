Page* and Richard P. Sear\u2020\nDepartment of Physics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, United Kingdom\n(Received 2 May 2006; published 10 August 2006)\nWe study the nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase in pores and find that the nucleation often\nproceeds via two steps: nucleation of pore filling, and nucleation out of the pore. These two rates have\nopposing dependencies on pore size, resulting in a pore size at which the nucleation rate of the new phase\nis maximal. This finding is relevant to attempts to design and use porous media to crystallize proteins.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.97.065701 PACS numbers: 64.60.Qb, 68.55.Ac, 82.60.Nh\nCrystallization and condensation both start with hetero-\ngeneous nucleation, which occurs at a surface. The nucleus\nof the crystal or liquid phase forms in contact with this\nsurface. In both cases nucleation is an activated process [1].\nThe barrier to formation and hence the rate of crystalliza-\ntion or condensation depends on the properties of the\nsurface. In particular, this rate is known to be very sensitive\nto the geometry of the surface. Studies of nucleation in\npores where the surfaces of the pore may confine the\nnucleus along one or more directions [2\u20135] have found\nthat both the size and shape of the pore strongly effect the\nnucleation rate. These studies were motivated by the desire\nto understand the hysteresis of phase transitions inside\nporous media [6,7]. Here, we study nucleation in pores\nvia computer simulations, and we find that nucleation\noccurs in the corners of pores. Thus, for example, unless\na slit pore is very long we expect condensation in it to occur\nvia nucleation in a corner, not via nucleation far from the\npore ends as was studied in earlier work [2,3]. This is\nconsistent with the work of Paul and Rieger [7] who found\nless hysteresis for a closed pore (which has corners) than\nfor an open pore (without corners).\nThus our work is relevant to condensation in porous\nmedia. However, the primary motivation behind this\nwork is to better understand the nucleation of protein\ncrystals in solutions that contain a piece of porous medium\n[8,9]. The nucleation only occurs in the presence of the\nporous medium and the crystals are found to be stuck to\nthis medium, implying that the protein crystal nucleates on\nthe surface of the porous medium. Surfaces that are not\nporous have proved less successful at promoting nucleation\n[9,10]. This is evidence that it is the geometry of the pores\nthat is accelerating nucleation. Finally, only disordered\nporous media were effective; media in which the pores\nwere of uniform size, such as zeolites, did not induce\nnucleation [9,10]. It was hypothesized [8,9] that there is\na pore size at which the nucleation rate was maximal and\nthat as disordered porous media have pores with a range of\nsizes a disordered porous medium is likely to have pores\nnear this size. A zeolite\u2019s pores are all the same size and it\nis improbable that this size will just happen to be a size at\nwhich the nucleation is fast. We find here that there is\nindeed a pore size at which the nucleation rate is fastest,\nsupporting the earlier hypothesis.\nAs we are interested in generic features of nucleation\nfrom pores, we study perhaps the simplest model: the two-\ndimensional Ising model on a square lattice with nearest-\nneighbor interactions [11,12]. This has previously been\nused to study heterogeneous nucleation [13,14]. As before\n[14] we study the model using Monte Carlo simulations\n[11]. Each site i on the square lattice has a spin si \u0001 \u00021\nassociated with it. In the Ising model at low temperatures\nthere is a transition from a phase with predominantly down,\n\u00031, spins to one with predominantly up,\u00041, spins. We will\nalways study nucleation of the spin-up phase from the spin-\ndown phase. The surface is formed of a region where the\nspins are fixed so that the spin si \u0001 \u00041. The rest of the\nspins we refer to as free spins. The experimental work\nwhich inspires our calculations is all on either crystals\n[9] or fluids [6] and porous media, yet we simulate a simple\nmodel magnet. We do so because nucleation is expected to\ndepend weakly on whether the dynamics are spin-flips or\nparticle diffusion.\nThe energy E of the system consists of three sums,\n E \u0001 JX0\nij\nsisj \u0003 h\nX\ni\nsi \u0004 Js\nX00\nij\nsisj; (1)\nwhere the first term is from interactions between free spins,\nthe second is the interaction between free spins and an\nexternal magnetic field h, and the third is for the interaction\nbetween the free spins and the fixed spins of the wall. The\ndash on the first sum indicates that it is over all nearest-\nneighbor pairs of free spins, and the double dash over the\nlast sum indicates that it is over all nearest-neighbor pairs\nof free and fixed spins. In Eq. (1), J is the strength of the\ncoupling between free spins and Js is the strength of the\ncoupling between a free spin and a fixed spin of the surface.\nHere we consider only Js \u0001 0. Our surfaces do not attract\neither phase. The surface free energies for the surface-spin-\nup, and surface-spin-down phases are identical and a spin-\nup\u2013spin-down interface hits the surface at a contact angle\n\u0001 \u0001 90\u0005.\nThe pores we study all have a simple rectangular slit\npore geometry; see Fig. 1. The surfaces of the sides and\nPRL 97, 065701 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending11 AUGUST 2006\n0031-9007=06=97(6)=065701(4) 065701-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nbottom of the pores are composed of fixed spins.\nSimulating the nucleation rates directly is prohibitively\nslow if the rates are low. Therefore, we will use the forward\nflux sampling (FFS) algorithm of Allen and coworkers\n[15]. This has previously been used to study nucleation\nin the Ising model [14] and also in an off-lattice model\n[16]. This allows us to efficiently calculate very low nu-\ncleation rates. For example, for the purposes of compari-\nson we calculated the rate of homogeneous nucleation and\nfound it to be 8:4\u0006 10\u000326 \u0002 2:1\u0006 10\u000326=cycle=site. One\ncycle is one attempted spin flip per lattice site. Homoge-\nneous nucleation is nucleation in the bulk; the nucleus\nforms far from any surface. This is at J=kT \u0001 0:8 and\nh=kT \u0001 0:05. The critical point of the two-dimensional\nIsing model is at J=kT \u0001 0:44 [12], so we are far below the\ncritical temperature. For the same values of J and h, we\nalso calculated the rate of heterogeneous nucleation on\na perfectly flat surface. It is 3:7\u0006 10\u000314 \u0002 1:2\u0006\n10\u000314=cycle=surface site. Per site the nucleation rate is\n12 orders of magnitude faster on a smooth surface than\nin the bulk. Thus for a system bounded by a smooth wall\nheterogeneous nucleation dominates unless the system is\nmore than 1012 sites across.\nWe will now consider nucleation from pores. The prin-\nciple results of our simulations are that (i) nucleation is\norders of magnitude faster at the pores than on a smooth\nsurface, and (ii) that it often proceeds via two steps. The\nsecond observation is clearly seen in Fig. 2. This shows the\nnumber of up spins as a function of time, for a system that\nis initially in the spin-down phase. The system clearly\nremains stable in the spin-down phase for approximately\n12 000 cycles before the number of up spins rapidly in-\ncreases to around 200 where it remains for a little more\nthan 20 000 cycles, before increasing again. In both cases\nthe number of spins is stable over thousands of cycles due\nto the existence of a nucleation barrier. It is kept stable\nclose to zero by a nucleation barrier for pore filling, then it\nis kept stable at around 200 by a barrier to nucleation out of\na pore. Between 12 000 and 32 000 cycles the pore is full\nbut in the bulk the system is still in the spin-down phase;\nsee Fig. 1(c) for a typical configuration.\nThe FFS algorithm of Allen and coworkers [15] calcu-\nlates the rate of a one-step activated process whereas here\nwe sometimes have a two-step process. However, the total\nmean time for nucleation at a pore, \u0002N , is simply the sum of\nthe mean time to nucleate inside a pore, \u0002FILL, and the\nmean time to nucleate out of a pore, \u0002OUT, if both nuclea-\ntion times are long, much longer than any times for growth.\nThus, if we want the nucleation rate for the spin-up phase\nin the presence of a pore \u0003N \u0001 \u0002\u00031N it is simply given by\n \u0003N \u0001 \u0007\u0003\u00031FILL \u0004 \u0003\u00031OUT\b\u00031; (2)\nwhere \u0003FILL \u0001 \u0002\u00031FILL and \u0003OUT \u0001 \u0002\u00031OUT. Thus we use the\nFFS algorithm to calculate the individual rates \u0003FILL and\n\u0003OUT then Eq. (2) to calculate the desired total rate. As an\norder parameter the total number of up spins was used,\nalthough for nucleation in the pore we also tried using the\nnumber of up spins in the pore and found that it gave the\nsame results but was no more efficient. Note that the FFS\nalgorithm is only weakly sensitive to the choice of order\nparameter [15].\nThe rate of nucleation of the bulk spin-up phase, as a\nfunction of the pore width w, is plotted in Fig. 3(a). The\nrates for nucleation in the pore, \u0003FILL, and out of the pore,\n\u0003OUT, are shown in Fig. 3(b). This is for J=kT \u0001 0:8 and\nh=kT \u0001 0:05. Data for J=kT \u0001 0:7 (not shown) show the\nsame features, including the peak. For small w, as w\ndecreases the rate tends to the rate for a flat surface, of\norder 10\u000314, while for large w, it reaches a plateau. There is\na clear maximum in the rate for pores w \u0001 12 and 13\nlattice sites across. Thus if, as in attempts to use porous\nmedia to induce the nucleation of protein crystals [9], it is\ndesired to maximize the nucleation rate, there is an opti-\nmum pore width. The results of Fig. 3 are for pores of depth\n30. We determined that this was sufficiently deep to ensure\nthat the nucleation rates were essentially independent of\n0 10 000 20 000 30 000\nNo. cycles\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nN\no.\n u\np \nsp\nin\ns\nFIG. 2 (color online).

Snapshot (c) shows a typical\nconfiguration for a pore filled with the spin-up phase but with\nthe bulk in the spin-down phase.\nPRL 97, 065701 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending11 AUGUST 2006\n065701-2\ndepth. For example, for pores of width 12 and depth 20 the\ncalculated nucleation rate is 8:1\u0006 10\u00037 \u0002 1:4\u0006\n10\u00037=cycle while if the depth is 30 the rate is 9:0\u0006\n10\u00037 \u0002 0:7\u0006 10\u00037=cycle. To help us understand the de-\npendence of the rate on the pore width w we turn to\nclassical nucleation theory (CNT).\nCNT [1] approximates the nucleation rate by\n Rate \u0001 \u0004 exp\u0007\u0003\u0001F\t=kT\b; (3)\nwhere \u0001F\t is the height of the free-energy barrier to\nnucleation, the free energy of the critical nucleus, and \u0004\nis an attempt frequency. We take \u0004 \u0001 1=cycle. Now for\nhomogeneous nucleation in the two-dimensional Ising\nmodel, the free energy of a circular nucleus of radius R is\n \u0001F \u0001 \u00032\u0005R2h\u0004 2\u0005R\u0006; (4)\nwhere the first term is the bulk term, the gain in free energy\nfrom forming the lower free-energy spin-up phase, and the\nsecond term is the surface term, the free energy cost of\nforming a spin-up\u2013spin-down interface at the edge of the\nnucleus. The interfacial tension between the two phases \u0006\nis given by Onsager\u2019s [12] exact expression and is \u0006 \u0001\n1:19kT at J=kT \u0001 0:8. The maximum in \u0001F of Eq. (4),\n\u0001F\tHOMO \u0001 \u0005\u00062=\u00072h\b, and occurs for a critical nucleus of\nradius R\t \u0001 \u0006=\u00072h\b.\nAside from homogeneous nucleation we will use CNT to\nestimate the nucleation rates for nucleation on a perfectly\nsmooth surface, nucleation in a corner, and nucleation on\ntop of a filled pore. For simulation snapshots of nucleation\nin a corner and on top of a filled pore see Figs. 1(b) and\n1(d), respectively. For heterogeneous nucleation on a per-\nfectly flat surface the nucleus is a semicircle because the\ncontact angle between spin-up\u2013spin-down interface and\nthe surface is \u0001 \u0001 90\u0005. The nucleus is just half the nucleus\nfor homogeneous nucleation and so has half the free en-\nergy. Thus the nucleation barrier on a smooth surface\n\u0001F\tFLAT \u0001 \u0001F\tHOMO=2, while the critical radius is the\nsame, R\t. For a wide pore, nucleation occurs in a 90\u0005\ncorner and the critical nucleus is too small to feel the effect\nof the other corner of the pore; see Fig. 1(b). There the\nnucleus is a quarter circle, and so the nucleation barrier\nin a right-angle corner \u0001F\t90 \u0001 \u0001F\tHOMO=4, with again a\nradius R\t.\nSo, within CNT the free-energy barriers for homoge-\nneous nucleation, nucleation on a perfectly smooth sur-\nface and nucleation in a corner are \u0001F\tHOMO, \u0001F\tHOMO=2,\nand \u0001F\tHOMO=4, respectively. Then CNT predicts that\nln\u0007RateHOMO=\u0004\b= ln\u0007RateFLAT=\u0004\b\u00010:5 and ln\u0007Rate90=\u0004\b=\nln\u0007RateHOMO=\u0004\b \u0001 0:25. As we have calculated all three\nrates from simulation we can determine the actual ratios\nand they are 0.54 and 0.30, respectively. Given the simple\nnature of CNT the agreement is satisfactory.\nThe final nucleation barrier we need to calculate is for\nnucleation out of an already filled pore. A snapshot of the\nspin-up phase nucleating out of a pore is shown in\nFig. 1(d). As the pore is already filled before nucleation\noccurs, this is not part of the nucleus. The CNT nucleus is a\nsemicircle as for nucleation on a perfectly smooth surface.\nThus the area, and hence the bulk term in the free energy is\nas for nucleation on a flat surface. However, as we can see\nfrom the simulation snapshot of Fig. 1(d), along its base the\nnucleus is in contact for w spins not with the surface but\nwith the spin-up phase that fills the pore. This contributes a\nterm \u0003w\u0006 to the free energy of formation of the nucleus.\nSo for nucleation out of a pore the free-energy barrier is\n \u0001F\tOUT \u0001 \u0001F\tHOMO=2\u0003 w\u0006; 2R\t \n w: (5)\nNucleation out of a filled pore is always faster than on a\nperfectly smooth surface, and the log of the rate should\nvary linearly with w. In Fig. 3(b) we have plotted the log of\nthe rate of nucleation out of a pore as the black curve. We\nsee that indeed it varies linearly with w; also the slope, at\n1.09, is close to \u0006=kT \u0001 1:19.\na.\n5 10 15 20 25\nWidth\n0\n1\u00d710-7\n2\u00d710-7\n3\u00d710-7\n4\u00d710-7\n5\u00d710-7\nR\nat\ne\nb.\n5 10 15 20 25\nWidth\n\u221225\n\u221220\n\u221215\n\u221210\nln\n (R\nate\n)\nFIG. 3 (color online). (a) the rate of nucleation as a function of\npore width w. The system is of 60 by 60 lattice sites, the pore is\n30 sites deep, J=kT \u0001 0:8 and h=kT \u0001 0:05.

The dashed curve (red online) is the overall rate for\nnucleation from a pore, the light gray (cyan online) curve is the\nnucleation rate in a pore, and the black curve is the nucleation\nrate of the bulk spin-down phase out of a pore that is already\nfilled with the spin-up phase.\nPRL 97, 065701 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending11 AUGUST 2006\n065701-3\nThus the rate of nucleation out of the pore increases\nexponentially with w. The rate of nucleation of pore filling\nhas the opposite dependence on w. For large w nucleation\nof pore filling occurs with a nucleus in one corner that is\nmuch less than w spins across and so does not interact with\nthe opposite side of the pore. This then leads to the plateau\nwhere the nucleation rate is independent of w. However,\nfor w comparable to the nucleus size R\t the nucleus does\nfeel the effect of the opposite side. CNT gives R\t \u0001 12 at\nthe conditions of Fig. 3. In Fig. 1(a) we have plotted a near-\ncritical nucleus for a pore of width 13. Note that it is\nsmaller than the nucleus in a wide pore, Fig. 1(b). The\nnucleus has been displaced to smaller sizes as by the time\nthat it has grown to span the pore it is over the barrier. This\nsmaller critical nucleus has a smaller free-energy barrier\nand hence the rate of pore filling is larger for pores of\nwidths \u000bR\t than for wider pores. At the values of w around\nR\t nucleation inside the pore is still rate limiting and so\nthis increase leads directly to an increase in nucleation rate\nof the bulk phase and hence to the maximum in the\nnucleation rate as a function of w. We have performed\nsimulations at other values of J and h, and we also have\npreliminary results for Js \u0001 0 and for a different pore\ngeometry, a wedge. In these systems too we have found\nmaxima in the rate; thus we are confident that a nonmono-\ntonic variation in the rate with pore width is not restricted\nto our particular pore geometry and value for Js.\nNucleation in pores 12 to 13 sites across is 7 orders of\nmagnitude faster than on a flat surface. Therefore, if these\npores are present at a density of more than one pore per\nmillion lattice sites of the surface, then nucleation from\nthese pores will dominate nucleation on the smooth parts of\nthe surface. Even at very low densities of pores nucleation\nat them dominates. Most nucleation, e.g., of ice in our\nfreezers, is heterogeneous and occurs on dirt or a container\nsurface. These surfaces will not be atomically smooth. The\ncritical nucleus for ice will be approximately a nanometer\nacross and we would expect the surfaces of dirt to have\nmany indentations, which will resemble pores, a nano-\nmeter or more deep. Thus, we would like to suggest that\nfor water and for other molecular systems, new phases\noften nucleate in small indentations on surfaces, not on\nsmooth parts of the surface. This is not the first suggestion\nthat pores are important; over 50 years ago Turnbull [17]\nsuggested that the history-dependent nucleation found in\nsome transitions, such as the crystallization of gallium, was\ndue to the nucleation occurring in pores.\nWe have considered heterogeneous nucleation at pores.\nWe found: (i) that the nucleation rate is orders of magni-\ntude higher at pores that on flat surfaces, (ii) that this rate is\nvery sensitive to size of the pore\u2014we found that the rate\nhad a maximum when our pores were 12 to 13 lattice sites\nacross\u2014and (iii) that for some pore widths the new bulk\nphase forms via two successive activated processes. The\ntwo processes are nucleation of pore filling and nucleation\nout of the pore to form the bulk spin-up phase. Either one\ncan be rate limiting. Within our Ising model the smaller the\npore the faster was pore filling but the slower was nuclea-\ntion out of the pore. Thus to maximize the nucleation rate\nof a protein crystal, the pores should not be much smaller\nthan the size of the critical nucleus of the crystal, as then\nnucleation out of the pore is slow, nor should they be much\nlarger than the critical nucleus, as then the initial pore\nfilling is slow. A pore approximately the same size as the\ncritical nucleus is optimal.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC for financial\nsupport to A. J.
