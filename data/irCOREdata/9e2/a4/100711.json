P. 55027, F-14076 Caen Cedex 5, France\n12Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark\n(Dated: August 26, 2008)\nThe structure of 17\u2212206 C nuclei was investigated by means of the in-beam \u03b3-ray spectroscopy\ntechnique using fragmentation reactions of radioactive beams. Based on particle-\u03b3 and particle-\u03b3\u03b3\ncoincidence data, level schemes are constructed for the neutron rich 17\u221220C nuclei. The systematics of\nthe first excited 2+ states in the Carbon isotopes is extended for the first time to A=20 showing that\nin contrast to the case of the oxygen isotopes, the N=14 subshell closure disappears. Experimental\nresults are compared with shell-model calculations. Agreement between them is found only if a\nreduced neutron\u2013neutron effective interaction is used. Implications of this reduced interaction in\nsome properties of weakly bound neutron-rich Carbon are discussed.\nPACS numbers: 23.20.Lv, 27.30.+t, 21.60.Cs, 25.70.Mn\nThe formation of nuclear shell gaps, as well as their col-\nlapse in certain regions of the chart of nuclides is largely\nbeing investigated worldwide. It impacts many unique\nfeatures in nuclear physics as the abundance of the sta-\nble elements in the universe, the possible existence of an\nisland of super heavy nuclei, the route of heavy nuclei to\nfission and the existence of cluster configurations.\nIt is a remarkable fact that the shell (or subshell) gaps,\nsuch 14, 28, 50 and to a weaker extent 82 and 126 share\na common origin. Taking for instance the neutron shell\ngaps, they are formed by the combined action of the\nspin-orbit (SO) force and by neutron-neutron interac-\ntions. The former force significantly over binds the orbit\nin which the angular momentum and intrinsic spin are\naligned (denoted as `\u2191). In addition, the filling of neu-\ntrons inside this orbit amplifies its binding due to the\nattractive neutron-neutron V nn`\u2191`\u2191 force of mainly pairing\norigin. As an example, the N = 28 shell gap is formed\nby the action of the SO force on the f orbit, which splits\nthe aligned f7\/2 (`\u2191) and anti-aligned f5\/2 (`\u2193) compo-\nnents by about 6 MeV apart in 40Ca. It pushes down the\nf7\/2 single particle state below the p3\/2 one, creating a\nsmall N = 28 gap of about 2 MeV between these two or-\nbits. Going from 40Ca to 48Ca, 8 neutrons have filled the\nf7\/2 orbit. This increases (decreases) the binding of the\nf7\/2 (p3\/2) orbit due to the action of attractive (repul-\nsive) neutron-neutron forces. Consequently the N = 28\ngap grows up to reach about 4.9 MeV in 48Ca, mak-\ning this nucleus doubly magic. Despite the fact that the\nmechanism to create shell gaps by means of attractive\nneutron-neutron two body matrix elements (TBME) V nn\nis well understood, the size of the empirical value required\n(here V nnf7\/2f7\/2) cannot be derived from realistic interac-\ntions between free nucleons. This points to the need for\nthree-body forces [1], the intensities of which should be\nconstrained by experimental data at these major shell\nclosures.\nAnother effect that plays a role in increasing or de-\ncreasing the above mentioned shell gaps is the proton-\nneutron tensor interaction. An example can be found in\nthe significant reduction of the N = 28 shell gap when\none goes from Ca down to Si [2, 3]. While removing pro-\ntons from the d3\/2 orbit between Ca to S, the strongly\nattractive force V pnd3\/2f7\/2 is no longer present [4]. This\nmakes the neutron f7\/2 less bound and reduces the size\nof the N = 28 gap by about 1.1 MeV between 40Ca and\n34Si.\nIn addition, as one approaches the neutron drip line,\nthe dependence of orbital energy on ` [5] becomes im-\nportant. As an example, the Skx Skyrme interaction [6]\nin\n2p\n3-\n00\n31\n27\n93\n, v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 2\n6 \nAu\ng \n20\n08\nAuthor manuscript, published in \"Physical Review C 78 (2008) 034315\"\n DOI : 10.1103\/PhysRevC.78.034315\n2(without SO) gives single-particle energies of -6.16 (-5.66)\nMeV for the 0f (1p) orbit in 48Ca compared to -1.03 (-\n1.57) MeV in 42Si. In this simple approach the p states\nbecomes more bound than the f one in 42Si. The low-\nering in energy of the low-` orbits relative to high ` is a\nconsequence of the loose binding in a finite-well poten-\ntial. Thus, the shell gaps are due to a combination of\nseveral factors which depend upon the orbits being filled\nand distance to stability.\nThese competing effects of the nuclear force, described\nfor N = 28, should to some extend be encountered for\nother shell gaps which share a common origin, such as 14,\n50... In this context the recent discovery of the N = 14\nshell gap of about 4 MeV in the oxygen chain [7, 8] pro-\nvides an ideal opportunity to study these facets of the\nnuclear force. This can be done by studying neutron-rich\nC isotopes around N = 14. In addition it has been de-\nduced from studies of the neutron-rich light B [9, 10] and\nN [11] nuclei that a significant reduction of the monopole\npart of the neutron-neutron matrix elements has to be\napplied to account for their spectroscopic properties. If\na similar reduction of the V nn has to be applied for the\nC chain, the strength of the N = 14 gap would be further\nreduced.\nThe present work focuses on the spectroscopy of the\nneutron-rich C isotopes, among which 20C14 is studied\nfor the first time (preliminary results were presented in\n[12]). A comparison of the structural evolution between\nthe O and C chains follows, aiming at searching for a\npossible reduction of the N = 14 shell gap.\nThe excited states of the heaviest C isotopes were stud-\nied using the in-flight double step fragmentation reaction,\nthe basic details of which were given in Ref. [7]. A beam\nof 36S (with an average intensity of 400 pnA) was ac-\ncelerated to an energy of 77.5 MeV\u00b7A by two cyclotrons\nof the GANIL facility to induce fragmentation reactions\ninto a 398 mg\/cm2-thick C target placed inside the SISSI\ndevice. Projectile-like fragments of interest were se-\nlected through the \u03b1 spectrometer. A wedge-shaped,\n130 mg\/cm2-thick, Al foil was installed at the dispersive\nfocal plane between the two dipoles of the spectrometer\nto provide an additional energy-loss selection. The mag-\nnetic rigidity of the \u03b1 spectrometer was optimized for\nthe transmission of a secondary beam cocktail composed\nof 24F, 25,26Ne, 27,28Na and 29,30Mg nuclei with energies\nvarying from 54 MeV\u00b7A up to 65 MeV\u00b7A. An \u2019active\u2019\ntarget composed of a plastic scintillator (103.5 mg\/cm2)\nsandwiched between two carbon foils of 51 mg\/cm2 was\nused both for identifying the nuclei of the cocktail beam\nthrough their time of flight values and for inducing sec-\nondary reactions. The secondary fragments were subse-\nquently selected and identified through the SPEG spec-\ntrometer using time of flight, energy loss, and focal-plane\nposition information.\nThe \u2019active\u2019 target was surrounded by a \u03b3-detector ar-\nray of 74 BaF2 detectors placed at a mean distance of\n30 cm from the target to detect the prompt \u03b3 decay of\nthe secondary fragments.

The total photo-peak efficiency of the\nBaF2 array was 30% for a \u03b3 ray of 1.3 MeV. The en-\nergy resolution (FWHM), including the part provided by\nthe Doppler broadening, amounts to 15%. Low-energy \u03b3\ntransitions down to 100 keV were detected with an effi-\nciency value of about 24%.\nThe Doppler-corrected \u03b3 spectra observed for 18C and\n20C are shown in Fig 1. The first excited state in 18C\nhas been proposed to be at 1620(20) keV [13]. This cor-\nresponds, very likely, to the 1585(10) keV transition ob-\nserved with the highest intensity in the present work.\nTwo additional \u03b3 lines have been observed at 919(10)\nand 2415(30) keV (see Fig. 1). By exploiting the \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3\ncoincidences, it is deduced that the 919 keV and 2415 keV\ntransitions are in coincidence with the 1585 keV one but\nnot in mutual coincidence. The proposed level scheme of\n18C (Fig. 2) is based on these pieces of information.\nPrior to the present work, information on the 20C nu-\ncleus was limited to lifetime and atomic mass values.\nEven if produced at a low rate of 4\/h using this double\nstep fragmentation method, the \u03b3-ray spectrum clearly\nexhibits a peak at 1588(20) keV (see Fig. 1). This unique\n\u03b3 line is assigned to the 2+ \u2192 0+ transition, placing for\nthe first time the energy of the first 2+ state of 20C at\n1588(20) keV.\nThe \u03b3-ray spectrum of the odd nucleus 17C exhibits\nin\n2p\n3-\n00\n31\n27\n93\n, v\ner\nsio\nn \n1 \n- 2\n6 \nAu\ng \n20\n08\n32\n0\n1\n(1\n5\n)\n2\n0\n7\n(1\n5\n)\n3\n2\n9\n(5\n)\nC\no\nu\nn\nts\nE (keV)\nFIG. 3: \u03b3-ray spectra of 17C and 19C obtained in the present\nexperiment.\ntwo transitions (see Fig. 3). Their relative intensity is the\nsame in the \u03b3-ray spectra of 17C obtained from the low\nand high \u03b3-ray multiplicity events. This indicates that\nboth transitions correspond to the decay of two excited\nstates at 207 and 329 keV directly to the ground state.\nAdditional pieces of information exist from other exper-\nimental works. The 17C ground state has a 3\/2+ spin\nvalue [14]. A level at about 300 keV has been evidenced\nfrom transfer reaction experiments [15, 16]. Given the\ntypical energy resolution obtained there, this level could\nbe a mixture of the two states observed in our exper-\niment. The neutron knock-out experiment performed\nat RIKEN [17] is in accordance with our results with\ntwo excited states at 210(4) and 331(6) keV. From the\n17C(p,p\u2019) study a tentative spin 1\/2+ was assigned to\nthe lower energy state and a spin 5\/2+ to the higher en-\nergy one [17]. Gathering all experimental works, a level\nscheme is proposed. It is in accordance with shell-model\ncalculations [18], the accuracy of which could not be bet-\nter than a few hundred keV.\nFor 19C, one-neutron break-up reactions proposed a\n1\/2+ configuration for the ground state [19]. As the\n201 keV \u03b3 transition is observed in our work as a prompt\nradiation, it should connect states separated by small\nspin differences such as 3\/2+ \u2192 1\/2+ or 3\/2+ \u2192 5\/2+.\nA stretched E2 transition of 201 keV, connecting for in-\nstance 5\/2+ and 1\/2+ states, would have a half-life of the\norder of a \u00b5s. By means of the 19C(p,p\u2019) reaction, two\n\u03b3-ray transitions with energies of 197(6) keV and 72(4)\nkeV were assigned to 19C [17]. The authors placed these\ntwo \u03b3 rays in cascade, the 197 keV one having the low-\nest energy. Similarly to 17C [18], shell-model calculations\npredict the existence of three low-lying states with spins\n1\/2+, 3\/2+ and 5\/2+ within a few hundred keV.\nThe present results extend the systematics of the 2+\nexcitation energy up to N = 14 in the carbon isotopic\nchain, as shown in Fig.5. The similarity of the trend of\n2+ energies of the C and O isotopes up to N = 12 is\nstriking. A strong change appears at N = 14, where the\n2+ energy of 20C is about a factor of two lower than for\n22O [7].\nThis different behavior between the O and C chains is a\nconsequence of the crossing of the neutron s1\/2 and d5\/2\nFIG. 4: Level schemes of 17C and 19C as observed in the\npresent experiment and their comparison with shell-model\ncalculations using the WBT* interaction.\norbits which arises between the 17O and 15C isotones.\nFrom their level schemes, it can be derived that the s1\/2\nneutron single particle energy decreases relative to the\nd5\/2 one by 1.6 MeV, while two protons are removed from\nthe p1\/2 orbit, giving rise to a 1\/2+ for the 15C ground\nstate [20]. This inversion of levels owes to the difference of\nproton-neutron TBME, 2(V pnp1\/2d5\/2 \u2212V pnp1\/2s1\/2). The first\nmonopole contains an attractive tensor term, whereas the\nsecond one has a repulsive two-body LS term [21]. In\naddition, we expect some shift from the finite potential\nwell of the central interaction. For instance, the Skx\nSkyrme interaction [6] (without spin-orbit) gives single-\nparticle energies of -3.44 (-3.76) MeV for the 0d (1s) orbit\nin 16O compared to +0.48 (-0.97) MeV in 14C, i.e. a\nrelative change of 1.13 MeV between the d and s orbits.\nThe evolution of the s1\/2 and d5\/2 Effective Single Par-\nticle Energies (ESPE) in the O and C chains as a function\nof the neutron number is shown in Fig.5. Starting from\n17O, the addition of five neutrons in the d5\/2 orbit leads\nto a gradual gain of its energy with respect to the s1\/2\nby virtue of the large attractive V nnd5\/2d5\/2 matrix element.\nThis gives rise to a new gap at N = 14 between the d5\/2\nand s1\/2 orbits of about 4.2 MeV [7]. This large gap\naccounts for the high energy of the 2+1 state in\n22O14\nwhich has a ((d5\/2)5, s1\/2) configuration. At N = 15 the\ns1\/2 orbit starts to fill, with a quasi pure single-particle\nconfiguration [22]. A large N = 16 gap of more than\n4 MeV is also present between the s1\/2 and d3\/2 orbits\nat N=16 [22, 23]. For the O isotopes WBT uses the\nUSD Hamiltonian [24] for the sd-shell. The more recent\nUSDA\/B Hamiltonians [25] differ from USD mainly for\nthe d3\/2 orbit between N=16 and N=20, which is about\n1 MeV more bound with USD compared to USDA\/B.\nAdding neutrons to 15C leads to a more complicated\nsituation. Initially the s1\/2 orbit is lower, but due to the\neffect described in the previous paragraph, the ESPE for\nd5\/2 crosses that of the s1\/2 orbit and stays close to it\nbetween N=8 and N=14. Therefore the configuration\nmixing is large and the ground state as well as the 2+1\nstate in 16,18,20C are dominated by (d5\/2, s1\/2)2,4,6 con-\nfigurations. This explains the almost constancy of the\n2+ energies up to 20C and disappearance of the gap at\nN=14.

This situation also leads\nto the possibility of many halo configurations in the Car-\nbon isotopes related to the loosely bound s1\/2 orbital.\nThe experimental level schemes of 18,20C (Figs. 2) are\ncompared to shell-model calculations using the WBT [18]\ninteraction. This interaction uses the USD TBME which\nreproduced the level energies of the heavy O nuclei suc-\ncessfully [7]. However, the experimental spectra for the\nC isotopes are systematically compressed compared to\nthe calculations. Similar results of ESPE and 2+1 exci-\ntation energies of 18C and 20C are found by Suzuki et\nal. [26] who used a Hamiltonian with enhanced tensor\ninteraction and corrections in the T=1 monopole terms.\nEmpirically, if the neutron-neutron TBME of WBT are\nmultiplied by 0.75, the spectra are in better agreement\nwith experiment (the results labeledWBT* in the figure).\nThis observation is in accordance with the fact that some\nproperties of neighboring nuclei, such as binding energies,\nmagnetic moments and spectroscopy [9, 10, 27, 28], could\nbe better described by means of a reduced strength of the\nneutron-neutron TBME as well.\nThe fundamental source of this reduction needs to be\nunderstood. There are at least two possibilities. One is\nthat neutron sd-shell orbits are more loosely bound in\nthe C isotopes. For example the s1\/2 state is bound by\n1.2 MeV in 14,15C compared to 3.3 MeV in 16,17O. The\nmeasured RMS matter radii of the weakly bound C are\nsystematically larger than in the O isotones [29], which\ncan be due to the weakly bound valence neutrons [30].\nCalculations with a delta-function form for the interac-\ntion show that this can lead to up to a 20% reduction\nin the TBME involving the s1\/2 orbit. Another factor is\nthat the core-polarization contributions can change. For\nthe O isotopes part of it is due to the excitation of the\np1\/2 protons into the sd and higher shells. For the C iso-\ntopes the p1\/2 proton orbit is nearly empty and cannot\ncontribute to the core polarization. Quantitative calcu-\nlations of these effects remain to be done.\nThe spectroscopy of C isotopes up to 20C has been car-\nried out for the first time. From the systematics of the\n2+1 energies, it is found that the N = 14 subshell gap is\nno longer present in the C isotopic chain. This sudden\nbreakdown is both ascribed to the early crossing of the\ns1\/2 and d5\/2 levels at N = 9 due to reduced proton-\nneutron tensor forces, the finite-well potential and to the\nreduced neutron-neutron interaction when going from O\nto C nuclei. Reasons for the reduction of V nn have been\nproposed, but they should be ascertained with further\ntheoretical and experimental studies. The present study\non the N = 14 shell closure shows a strong analogy with\nearlier findings at N = 28, revealing that a generic mech-\nanism acts to destroy the \u2019major\u2019 shell closures. Applied\nto the next shell closure N = 50, the 78Ni50 could turn\nout to be not doubly magic. For heavier nuclei, the\nstronger spin-orbit force acting on large `-values keeps\nthe magicity for the N = 82 and N = 126 shell closures,\ni.e. for 132Sn and 208Pb.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by the European Community\ncontract No RII3-CT-2004-506065, by OTKA K68801 and by\nNSF PHY-0555366 grants.
