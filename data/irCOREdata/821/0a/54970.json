INTRODUCTION\nW ITH the recent changes in the world climate being at-tributed to global warming and the depletion of fossil\nfuels, energy conservation is becoming of paramount concern.\nIn response to this need, the designers of power supplies for in-\ndustrial, commercial and domestic market sectors are contin-\nually searching for technologies which meet their systems\u2019 re-\nquirements while simultaneously achieving higher operating ef-\nficiencies. Resonant power converters have been recognized as a\nviable technology in this pursuit by virtue of providing: 1) zero-\nvoltage switching (ZVS) and\/or zero current switching (ZCS)\nof the power devices; 2) a reduction in component sizes; and\n3) the incorporation of the normally detrimental effects of para-\nsitic elements, as design components (transformer leakage and\nmagnetising inductances, and inter-winding capacitances being\nprimary candidates), thereby further improving power density.\nOwing to these properties, resonant converter technologies are\nfinding their way into all manner of applications including con-\nsumer electronic devices and high-power factor telecommunica-\ntions supplies [1], automotive battery charging [2] and fuel cell\nbackup supplies [3], as well as capacitor charging for pulsed\npower applications [4].

Such factors have there-\nfore impeded the widespread adoption of resonant converter\nsupplies primarily due to the lack of viable mathematical models\nthat can be rapidly employed during the design and evaluation\nprocess, except in niche market sectors such as for lamp ballasts.\nThe paper focuses on enhanced techniques to facilitate the\nmodelling, rapid analysis and design of the CLL resonant\nconverter. This converter type is a member of the more generic\nLCLC class, and has found particular favour by virtue of the\nrequired resonant tank inductors being conveniently formed\nfrom the leakage and magnetising inductances of a transformer\n(see Fig. 1), while providing a ZVS load-independent operating\npoint above resonance [5]\u2014a particularly attractive feature for\napplications requiring a constant output voltage\/constant input\nvoltage\/variable load characteristic. Indeed, this topology has\nrecently emerged in some consumer electronics products for\nthe reasons given above.\nAs discussed, accurately predicting the behavior of CLL\nconverters is complicated by the nonlinear relationship of the\noutput voltage with excitation (input voltage and switching\nfrequency) and load. Consequently, designers often resort\nto transient-based simulation packages, such as SPICE, to\naccurately predict the behavior, at the expense of substantial\nsimulation time. In an attempt to expedite the design process,\nfundamental mode approximation (FMA) has been exten-\nsively adopted for the analysis of various resonant converter\ntopologies [5]\u2013[7]. However, while FMA assumes that all\ncircuit voltages and currents take on a sinusoidal waveshape,\nthereby permitting standard ac circuit analysis techniques to\nbe employed, its accuracy is compromised for nonsinusoidal\nand nonsquare waveform shapes, as found in the behavior\nof the CLL converter variant. This disadvantage of FMA has\nbeen widely reported, and has resulted in several studies that\nhave developed models based on the steady-state solution of\nthe underlying state-variable equations that accurately de-\nscribe resonant circuit behavior [8]\u2013[10]. While the results\nof these models can be very accurate, they are often difficult\n0885-8993\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nFOSTER et al.: ANALYSIS OF CLL VOLTAGE-OUTPUT RESONANT CONVERTERS 1773\nto implement and interpret, and recourse to the use of design\ncharts and\/or numerical type solutions to realize a design, is\ncommonplace.\nThis paper specifically presents a modelling methodology for\nthe CLL voltage-output converter developed using describing\nfunction techniques, where the voltage across the parallel\ninductor, , and current through the rectifier, , is more\naccurately described. A similar technique has previously been\nsuccessfully applied to model the LCC voltage-output converter\n[11]\u2013[14] and the LCC current-output converter operating under\nheavy load conditions [15]. The presented analysis is based\non an approximate model for the CLL converter previously\nreported in [16] where the waveform shape of is approxi-\nmated by a half-wave rectified sinusoid with dead-periods. An\nimprovement on this is now reported by employing a more de-\ntailed description for the waveform characteristics. Specifically,\nit is assumed that takes on a sinusoidal form and that\nand can be decomposed into a set of piecewise equations\nthat more accurately describe their waveshapes. Applying a\nFourier transformation to these waveforms and extracting the\nfundamental permits the development of an equivalent circuit\nmodel with demonstrably improved accuracy.\nII. DESCRIPTION OF CONVERTER OPERATION\nReferring to Fig. 1, the half-bridge MOSFETs and\nare switched in anti-phase at a frequency to produce a\nsquarewave input excitation voltage . This voltage excites\nthe resonant tank, causing a current to flow. When the rec-\ntifier is conducting, is clamped by and current flows\nfrom the resonant circuit into , replenishing the charge and\ndictating the output voltage. If, immediately after the rectifier\nturn-off commutation, is greater than , then the\nrectifier turns-on. During these conditions the converter is said\nto be operating in continuous rectifier current mode, and\ncan be considered a square waveform\u2014see Fig. 2(a). How-\never, for certain excitation\/loading conditions (as discussed in\nSection III-C) and the rectifier remains off for\na significant portion of the switching half-cycle. During this\n\u201cnonconduction period\u201d [ in Fig. 2(b)] all of flows through\n, and then takes on a cosine characteristic\u2014the converter\nis then considered to be operating in a discontinuous rectifier\ncurrent condition mode. The effect of the nonconduction period\nis to significantly alter the effective resonant frequency and\neffective -factor of the supply, enabling \u2018boosting\u2019 of the\noutput voltage.\nIII. DERIVATION OF EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODELS\nIt is now assumed that the input current is sinusoidal\u2014the\njustification for this being that the tank circuit is essentially a\nband-pass filter and significantly attenuates all harmonics other\nthan the resonant frequency. Thus, it is reasonable to assume\nthat\n(1)\n(Note: to simplify notation is normalized by to an angle\nthroughout.)\nFig. 2. Resonant circuit voltage and current waveforms: (a) operation with con-\ntinuous i and (b) operation with discontinuous i .\nFig. 3. Equivalent circuit of CLL voltage-output converter.\nIn the analyses that follow, the parallel inductor, rectifier and\noutput filter are replaced by an equivalent impedance, . An\nexpression for is derived by describing the parallel inductor\nvoltage by its fundamental component and dividing\nby the current flowing through the resonant circuit . is\nsubsequently combined with and to form an AC equiva-\nlent circuit model of the converter, see Fig. 3. The magnitude of\nthe input current, , is then determined using Ohm\u2019s law, and\nis employed as an equivalent current source to determine .\nEssential to this activity is the determination of switching in-\nstants and signal amplitudes to facilitate the description of\n1774 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nby piecewise equations. Once achieved, can be expanded\nusing a Fourier series from which the fundamental can be\nextracted.\nA. Operation With Continuous Conduction\nWhen operating in this condition [Fig. 2(a)] is clamped\nto for the whole cycle period and can be seen to\nlag by an angle . Thus, can be described by a piece-\nwise equation relating the different circuit configurations to the\ncomponent waveform shapes and phase angles. This expression\ncan be suitably manipulated using a Fourier series to develop\nthe complex, equivalent impedance that describes the inter-\naction of with via the rectifier. Ultimately, this leads to\nan expression for the output voltage from knowledge of the av-\nerage current flow through the rectifier.\nSince is continuous, must be clamped to via the\nrectifier. The parallel inductor voltage is therefore described by\n(2)\nThe current flowing through the parallel inductor is deter-\nmined by integrating (2) to give (3), as shown at the bottom\nof the page, where is the initial condition of the\noperatingmode\u2014 is found from the solutionof\nto obtain an expression for the initial condition in terms of\n. Substituting for in the initial\ncondition is found, .\nis determined by evaluating the average current flowing\nthrough the rectifier during a half-cycle. Thus, evaluating the\nfollowing integral over a half-cycle, we have\n(4)\nAfter suitable substitution, this leads to the output current\n(5)\nand using Ohm\u2019s law, the output voltage is given by\n(6)\nBefore , and hence , can be determined, the rectifier\ncommutation angle and the equivalent impedance (see\nFig. 3) must be known. The angle is found by noting that\n. Substituting for and and after suitable\nmanipulation leads to\n(7)\nwhere\nThe equivalent impedance is obtained by taking the Fourier\ntransform of (2) and extracting the fundamental to provide a de-\nscribing function approximation for . Performing a Fourier\nseries expansion on (2), the fundamental component is\nobtained as\n(8)\nSubstituting for , dividing by the tank input current (1) and\nafter rearrangement, the equivalent impedance is given by\n(9)\nFinally, the resonant circuit input current is found from the\ntotal circuit impedance and\nusing the fundamental component of the tank input voltage as\nfollows:\n(10)\nB. Operation With Discontinuous Conduction\nThis is similar to Section III-A, where a description for\nis developed. However, the addition of the nonconduction pe-\nriod significantly complicates the analysis.

MODEL VALIDATION\nTo demonstrate the prediction accuracy of the proposed\nmodels, a prototype 100 W, 42\u201312 V, half-bridge CLL con-\nverter, with a center-tapped transformer-rectifier, has been\nconstructed. The converter is chosen to nominally operate at\n150 kHz by selecting this as the load-independent point, and to\nexhibit discontinuous rectifier current for 4.5 and 6 loads\nwhen operated at frequencies beyond this. The converter\u2019s\ncomponent parameters are listed in Table I. A series resistance\nof 200 m is included to incorporate the effects of the trans-\nformer winding resistance and MOSFET .\nThe prediction performance of the proposed equivalent\ncircuit models is validated against PLECS\u00ae [17] time-domain\nsimulations, and measurements from the prototype converter,\nin Figs. 4 and 5, where it can be seen that models provide\naccurate predictions of behavior. Fig. 4 also shows the im-\nprovement in prediction accuracy over FMA techniques for\nlighter loads.\nV. NORMALIZED ANALYSIS OF THE CLL VO CONVERTER\nHere, normalized voltage and current relationships are devel-\noped from the above equivalent circuit models, which are sub-\nsequently used to determine appropriate converter parameters\nto meet a particular design requirement.

Also, when\nthe converter has a gain of 0.5 for all and values\u2014this\nis considered to be the load independent point. Finally, the in-\nductor ratio has a significant effect on the . Specifically,\nas increases the effective voltage gain reduces. Indeed, for\nvery large values of and , the circuit exhibits typical series\nresonant converter (SRC) type behavior.\nB. to Current Gain\u2014\nAn expression for is obtained by rearranging (5) and (14)\nto give\n(23)\nFig. 7 shows example as a function of in a similar\nmanner to Fig. 6. To make the comparison more tractable for\n\u201creal-world\u201d designs, is converted to a rms value by dividing\nby . The series of curves clearly demonstrate that as both\nand are increased there is increased coupling between the\noutput and the input. Indeed, for large values the converter tends\ntowards SRC type behavior once again (i.e., is prohibitively\nlarge so that negligible current flows through it).\nOther useful voltage and current relationships for the reso-\nnant circuit components are given in the Appendix\u2014derived by\nsimilar procedures.\nC. Practical Considerations\nFrom the presented results, for efficient converter operation,\na high is sought, thereby reducing the current flowing into\nthe resonant tank, and hence, their associated losses. This can\nbe achieved by designing for a large and operating about\nthe load independent point (L.I.P.). However, in practice, this\ncan be problematic if the converter has to operate over a large\ninput voltage and load range. Moreover, large ratios are\noften difficult to achieve when employing integrated magnetic\ncomponents, and, also, the rectifier is ultimately hard switched,\nleading EMI concerns. A compromise is therefore often nec-\nessary\u2014converter parameters are required so that\nthe converter gain is maintained while reducing the losses. This\ntask is not trivial given that the converter has limited voltage\ngain capabilities for given parameters. By way of example,\nFig. 8 shows the maximum permissible voltage gain that can\nbe obtained for several values of , as a function of . Often,\n1778 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 7. J as a function of ! for various Q values. (a) A = 1, (b) A = 2, (c) A = 5, and (d) A = 10.\nFig. 8. Converter gain as a function of series Q-factor for numerous inductor\nratios.\ntherefore the design procedure can require many iterations.\nNevertheless, the overhead can be reduced by examining the\nconverter\u2019s frequency response to see if the output voltage is\nFig. 9. Example of a typical converter frequency response used for parameter\nevaluation.\nsatisfied given the extremities of output power and input\nvoltage ranges, see Fig. 9 for instance. One way to ap-\nproach this problem could be to constrain switching frequency\nFOSTER et al.: ANALYSIS OF CLL VOLTAGE-OUTPUT RESONANT CONVERTERS 1779\nTABLE II\nERROR MAP PARAMETER RANGE\nunder max. , min. operating condition to the series\nresonant frequency and then determine converter parameters\nthat allow the worst case operating condition to be achieved\nsimultaneously.\nVI. MODEL BOUNDARIES\nConverter models have a limited range of applicability owing\nto the approximations made during their derivation. This is par-\nticularly true of those derived using describing function tech-\nniques, and where it is known that the underlying system char-\nacteristics can significantly change over the operating envelope.\nFor resonant systems in particular, as the converter is worked\nover its nominal operating range (and beyond) the resonant tank\nwaveshapes can change significantly. It is therefore prudent to\ngive boundaries of model applicability. Due to significant com-\nplexity involved in determining these boundaries, a similar tech-\nnique to that reported in [14], is taken, where many randomly\ngenerated converter designs are simulated using accurate time-\ndomain based models, the results of which are used to validate\nthe describing function models over a wide parameter range.\nNotably, the normalized design parameters are used, thereby\nproviding generically applicable results for a wide range of con-\nverter specifications.\nEmploying a random number generator, converter compo-\nnent values and an operating point is chosen from the parameter\nrange indicated in Table II. The resulting converter design is\nthen simulated using PLECSs\u00ae, a Matlab\u00ae\/Simulink\u00ae power\nelectronics toolbox. The filter capacitor for this model is chosen\nto provide a ripple voltage within 0.25% of the output voltage\npredicted by the proposed model. Effectively, the charge\nflowing into the capacitor over a given time period is equated to\nits voltage rise using sinusoidal approximations. The resulting\nPLECS model is subsequently simulated for 50 the output\nfilter time constant. Finally, the output of the PLECS simulation\nis used to generate an error voltage that is plotted as a function\nof normalized parameters\u2014see Fig. 10. Owing to the large\nnumber of designs considered (over 100 000) the parameter\nspace on each error map is divided into a grid, with each pixel\nrepresenting the level of prediction error (from 0% to 10%);\nthe pixel value being determined by the average \u201cerror\u201d within\neach element of the grid. The prediction error for an individual\nsimulation is calculated from\n% (24)\nFig. 10(a) shows the variation in prediction error as a func-\ntion of switching frequency and converter gain. Generally, the\ngreatest concentration of results follow the frequency character-\nistics of the gain curves presented in Fig. 6. However, it can also\nbe seen that definite boundaries exists where either the predic-\nFig. 10. Error map of converter gain against normalized switching frequency.\n(a) Proposed equivalent circuit model. (b) FMA equivalent circuit model.\ntions are considered unreliable or where the converter param-\neters provide designs whose projected performance is outside\nthe confidence tolerances. It is clear that for gains greater than\n0.5, the converter must be operated below the series resonant\nfrequency. The speckling effect seen at high conversion ratios\nis due to the high sensitivity of the measurements as a conse-\nquence of low -factors. For completeness, an error map based\non predictions using a FMA equivalent circuit model is also pre-\nsented [Fig. 10(b)] highlighting the improvement in prediction\naccuracy at light loads which is achievable using the proposed\ndescribing function model.\nA plot of gain versus series -factor is given in Fig. 11. It can\nbe seen that for the maximum gain that can be achieved\nis 0.6 or less. Thus, somewhat counter intuitively owing to the\nseries resonant circuit definition of -factor, to achieve high\ngains, low values of are necessary. The figure also shows\nthat a \u201cminimum gain boundary\u201d exists\u2014therefore for converter\ngains less than 0.4, should be restricted.\nIn addition to determining model applicability boundaries,\nthe error maps are useful as an indication of design accuracy,\n1780 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 11. Error map of converter gain against series Q-factor.\nor the probable robustness of designs. For example, by placing\na marker on a plot whose location corresponds to the converter\u2019s\nparameters, a qualitative appreciation of the projected accuracy\nof a converter design, i.e., a confidence measure, can be made.\nA more detailed treatment on the use of such error maps can be\nfound in [10].\nVII. CONCLUSION\nBased on describing function techniques, a model for the CLL\nvoltage-output converter operating with continuous and discon-\ntinuous rectifier currents, has been developed. By employing\nmore precise waveshape descriptions of the rectifier current and\nparallel inductor voltage, the models offer improved prediction\naccuracy over traditional FMA based techniques, as demon-\nstrated by a comparison of results from time-domain simula-\ntions and measurements from a prototype converter. Normalized\nvoltage conversion ratio, and resonant circuit to output current\nratios, have been developed using the derived models. These ra-\ntios provide the designer with useful information regarding per-\nmissible voltage gain and current coupling. Furthermore, design\nrecommendations based on these ratios have also been provided.\nFinally, error maps that have been generated using comparisons\nof over 100 000 time-domain based simulations that have been\nemployed to investigate the models\u2019 accuracy and parameter\nboundaries.\nAPPENDIX I\nRectifier current relationship\nSeries capacitor voltage relationship\nSeries inductor voltage relationship\nParallel inductor current ratio\nParallel inductor voltage ratio\nREFERENCES\n[1] W.-Y.
