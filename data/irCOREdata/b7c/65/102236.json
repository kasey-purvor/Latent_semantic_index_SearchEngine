Introduction \n \nMaterials displaying high oxide-ion and proton conductivity have attracted considerable \ninterest due to technological applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), sensors and \nseparation membranes. Traditionally fluorite and perovskite-related materials have been \ntargeted, although more recently there has been growing interest in alternative structure types, \nsuch as La2Mo2O9, apatites, and cuspidines [1-5].  The complex structures of these new \nmaterials raises the key question of how oxide ion\/proton migration proceeds. In this respect, \ncomputer modelling studies can provide important information, as shown for the apatite-type \nlanthanum silicates, where a complex interstitial migration mechanism was identified [6]. In \nthis paper we perform similar atomistic simulation studies for the cuspidine systems. \nResearch in this area has grown following the initial report of oxide ion conduction in \nNd4(Ga2\u2212xMxO7+x\/2)O2 (M=Ti, Ge) by  Joubert et al. [7,8] Subsequently Martin-Sedeno et al. \nconfirmed these results, and showed that in the system, La4(Ga2-xTixO7+x\/2)O2 proton \nconduction was also observed at low temperatures (below \u2248950K) in wet atmospheres [9, 10].  \nCuspidine-type oxides have the ideal general formula A4(M2O7)O2 (A= rare earth, M= Al, \nGa) and can be described as consisting of chains of edge-sharing AO7\/AO8 polyhedra \ninterconnected through the M2O7 units. As shown by the earlier work in this area, the formula \nis better written as A4(M2O7\u206a1 )O2  (\u206a= oxygen vacancy) to show that there is a vacant \noxygen position between the M2O7 groups [9]. By suitable doping with a higher valent cation, \ne.g. La4(Ga2-xTixO7+x\/2\u206a1-x\/2 )O2, the introduction of extra oxygen is possible, leading to the \nconversion of the isolated M2O7 groups into infinite chains of distorted trigonal bipyramids, \nas observed for La4(Ti2O8)O2 (figure 1) [10]. \nIn order to investigate the defect characteristics and ion migration mechanisms in these \ncuspidine systems in more detail, we report an atomistic simulation study of La4(Ti2O8)O2.  \n 3 \n2. Methods \nThe structure and defects in the cuspidine type La4(Ti2O8)O2 were investigated with atomistic \npotential energy minimisation computer simulations [11]. This atomistic potential method \nutilises energy minimisation techniques to determine the lowest energy configuration of the \ncrystal system with respect to the atomic positions. The potential energy of the crystal lattice \nis obtained by summing the long range Coloumbic terms and the short range repulsion and \ndispersion forces or pair potentials, in this case the atomistic pair potentials are in the form of \nthe Buckingham Potential (Eq 1). \n6exp r\nCrAV ij\nij\njij \u2212\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2212\n=\n\u03c1\n  (1) \nAn important feature of the model is the ability to describe the polarisation of the atoms and \nin this system both the lanthanum and oxygen atoms are described in terms of the shell model: \nan atomic shell of charge Y, which represents the valence electrons, is connected to the \natomic core or core electrons by a harmonic spring constant k. The polarisability on the free \nion can therefore be described as: \n  \u03b1=Y2\/k     (2) \nFor the water incorporation studies, the O-H interaction is modelled using the Morse \npotential: \nV(r)=D{1\u2212exp[\u2212\u03b2(r\u2212r0)]}2   (3) \nThe potentials were fitted to experimental data [10], and good agreement to the structure was \nobtained. The Buckingham potentials and shell charges used in the model for La4(Ti2O8)O2 \nand the comparison to the experimental structure are given in table 1. The defects are \nmodelled with the Mott-Littleton approach [12] where the region around the defect is split \ninto two regions. The inner region is a specified radius, in this case 12\u00c5, and the outer region \nstretches to infinity. The relaxation of the inner region is calculated explicitly, while the atoms \n 4 \nin the outer regions are relaxed by quasi-continuum methods. A more detailed description of \nthis technique has been given elsewhere [13]. \n3. Results and Discussion \nStructure and Defects \nThe structure of La4(Ti2O8)O2 is composed of chains of TiO5 groups, which are bridged by \noxygens (O3), with channels of lanthanum and oxygen sandwiched between the chains (figure \n1). Initially, the Frenkel and Schottky defect energies were calculated (Table 2), with the most \nfavourable intrinsic defect energy being the oxygen Frenkel defect (1.41 eV\/defect). This is \nrelatively low compared to the Lanthanum and Titanium Frenkel defect energies, and \nsuggests that low levels of interstitia1 oxygen ions may occur in these materials at higher \ntemperatures. This phenomenon may account for the presence of high temperature oxide ion \nconduction in stoichiometric La4(Ti2O8)O2 and an interstitial oxide ion conduction migration \nmechanism is discussed below. The most favourable interstitial position was found to be \nlocated directly below the titanium in the trigonal pyramid TiO5, forming an octahedral unit \n(Figure 2a). The lowest energy for an oxygen vacancy occurs at the O3 bridging site (Figure \n2b). This defect creates a break in the TiO5 chains forming two terminal TiO4 groups, similar \nto the structure observed for La4(Ga2O7)O2. [9] \n \nOxide ion migration mechanisms \nIn order to elucidate the oxide ion diffusion mechanisms in this material, initial oxide ion \nvacancy diffusion pathways between adjacent O3 sites were attempted. This proved to be a \nnon trivial task, with several vacancy migration pathway calculations between adjacent sites \nproving unsuccessful. A different \u2018co-operative\u2019 oxide ion movement, rather than the \ncommon vacancy \u2018hopping\u2019 mechanism, which is observed for perovskites and fluorites was \ntherefore considered. Nudged elastic band calculations (NEB) were used to calculate \n 5 \nrotational trajectories of the oxygens around the titanate units. These calculations were \nperformed by creating an oxygen vacancy point defect at an O3 position, and then using the \nnudged elastic band technique to rotate two oxygens, one into the vacancy position and one \ninto the position just vacated, creating an O3 vacancy at the adjacent O3 position. The most \nfavourable rotation occurs via such a co-operative vacancy hopping mechanism (Figure 3a), \nwhere a bridging oxygen (O3) rotates towards an O2 position, as the O2 oxygen moves in a \nco-operative motion towards the vacant oxygen site. An energy barrier of 1.51eV was \ncalculated for this mechanism, which is in excellent agreement with the experimentally \nobserved values for oxygen deficient La4(Ti2-xGaxO8-x\/2)O2 systems (Ea \u2248 1.6 eV) [10].  The \nlower valence of Ga compared to Ti could in principle result in some Ga-oxygen vacancy \ndefect association. However, the fact that there is only a small difference between the \nexperimental activation energy (1.6 eV) and that calculated from the modelling (1.51 eV) \nwould suggest that any defect association is small.    \nThe energy barrier for interstitial oxide ion migration was then investigated, using the same \nstructure as for the vacancy migration, and was found to be low (0.49eV) compared to the \nvacancy migration. However, in order for an interstitial migration mechanism to occur in \nLa4(Ti2O8)O2, a Frenkel defect must first be created, which requires additional energy. This \nwould explain the lower conductivities in undoped La4(Ti2O8)O2, but also poses the question \nwhether oxygen excess systems can be prepared by suitable doping, as an alternative means \nof enhancing the conductivity. Further experimental strudies are required to investigate this \npossibility. Figure 3b shows the interstitial migration mechanism, which propagates via the \nmovement of the interstitial oxide ion along the TiO5 chain.  \nProton Incorporation \nAs shown by Martin-Sedeno et al., water incorporation and proton conduction can occur in \nthese cuspidine systems at low temperatures [10]. The defect energy for an OH defect has \n 6 \ntherefore been calculated for a proton attached to different oxygen atoms within the structure \nand at the most favourable oxygen interstitial position. The calculations indicate that the most \nfavourable site for proton incorporation is at the O3 bridging oxygen. The equations and \nenergies for the water incorporation at a vacant O3 site and the interstitial positions are given \nin table 3. The higher water incorporation energies at interstitial and mixed interstitial and \nvacant sites suggest that oxygen vacancies are required for water incorporation to occur. This \nresult agrees with experimental data where proton conduction has been only observed in the \nmaterials which possess oxide ion vacancies [10]. Further studies are required to elucidate the \nproton conduction mechanism. \n4. Conclusions \nLa4(Ti2O8)O2 possesses a complex cuspidine-type structure, and as a result a more in depth \nNEB method of investigation was necessary to elucidate oxide ion conduction mechanisms \nand processes. This NEB method highlights the importance of co-operative oxygen movement \nin this material, with the most favourable oxide ion vacancy mechanism being for a co-\noperative rotational process, which propagates the vacancy from one O3 bridging position to \nthe next. The calculated activation energy of 1.51 eV corresponds well to experimental data. \nThe most favourable position for water incorporation was shown to be at the oxygen vacancy \nsites, rather than at an interstitial position, indicating that vacancies are required for water \nincorporation in agreement with experiment. Overall, this work illustrates the power of \natomistic potential modelling in aiding our understanding of defects and defect processes at \nthe atomic level in complex systems such as this. \n \nReferences \n1.
