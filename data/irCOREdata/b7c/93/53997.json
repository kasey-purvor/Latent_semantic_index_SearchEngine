Similarly, in seasonally breeding \nspecies, the mating season represents a period where the competition for mating \npartners increases, thus affecting amicable social interactions among group members. \nThe aims of this study were thus to analyse the importance of the mating season and of \nseasonal variations in diet composition and food competition on reconciliation in wild \nfemale Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui) living on Yakushima Island, Japan. \nYakushima macaques are appropriate for this topic as they are seasonal breeders and \ntheir diet composition significantly changes among the seasons. Although large \ndifferences were found between the summer months and the winter and early spring \nmonths in activity budgets and the consumption of the main food sources (i.e. fruits, \nseeds and leaves), the level of food competition and conciliatory tendency remained \nunaffected. Conversely, conciliatory tendency was significantly lower during the mating \nseason than in the non-mating season. Moreover, conciliatory tendency was lower when \none or both female opponents were in oestrous than when they were not. These results \nindicate that the mating season have profound effects on reconciliation whereas this is \nnot true for seasonal changes in activity budgets and diet composition. The detrimental \neffects of the mating season on female social relationships and reconciliation may be \ndue to the importance of female competition for access to male partners in multi-male, \nmulti-female societies. \n \nKey Words: Diet, competition, Japanese macaque, mating season, post-conflict \nbehaviour.  \n 2\nINTRODUCTION \nSocial primates usually concentrate their activity during daylight and devote a \nsignificant proportion of the day to the exchange of amicable social behaviour (mainly \ngrooming). Grooming helps primates to establish and maintain long-lasting good \nrelationships with some other group members which have consequences on an animal\u2019s \nfitness (e.g. increased tolerance or agonistic support; Dunbar, 1991). Animals who \nmaintain amicable relationships with one another also have a higher frequency of \nreconciled conflicts than animals who rarely exchange grooming or have competitive \nrelationships (the good relationship hypothesis; Aureli et al., 2002). Reconciliation is \ndefined as the post-conflict friendly reunion of former opponents that restores their \nsocial relationship (Aureli & de Waal, 2000). Given that grooming is time consuming, \nthe possibility for an animal to maintain amicable relationships and a high frequency of \nreconciliation with some group companions clearly depends on how much time is left \nfrom more essential activities (e.g. foraging or mating; Dunbar 1992). Moreover, \necological variables that may influence the type of social relationships among group \nmembers (e.g. Krebs and Davies, 1997) are also expected to have an effect on \nreconciliation. When food is less available and\/or clumped, for example, animals should \nspend more time searching for it and should have less time for grooming exchange (e.g. \nMiller & Dietz 2004). Under these circumstances, contest food competition among \ngroup members should be high and, consequently, the overall frequency of \nreconciliation should be low. Diet composition also determines activity budgets and \nsocial relationships among group members. Frugivorous species fulfil their daily \nenergetic requirement quicker than folivores (as fruits and seed are more energetic food \nsources than leaves) and thus usually have more time available for social behaviour \n(Gillespie & Chapman 2001; Janson and Goldsmith, 1995). At the same time, however, \n 3\nand other things being equal (e.g. food availability), food competition is expected to be \nhigher in frugivorous species than in folivores (van Schaik 1989). This is because fruits \nand seeds often occur in more clumped, potentially monopolisable, patches than leaves \n(Pruetz & Isbell 2000), and they constitute more valuable resources (Janson & \nGoldsmith 1995).  \nThe mating season represents another possible source of competition, as animals \nstrive to maximise their reproductive success. Although female-female competition for \nmating partners has often been neglected, this may be an important factor affecting \nfemale social relationships. This is particularly true for species living in multi-male, \nmulti-female groups and characterised by multiple copulations usually concentrated \nwithin the consorting period, as is the case in macaques (Melnick & Pearl, 1987). This \ntype of sexual behaviour is time consuming so that dominant males may be unable to \nmonopolise mating partners, particularly when two or more females are in oestrus at the \nsame time (Vasey, 1998). Moreover, females consorting with dominant males may gain \nmany sort- or long-term benefits, such as reduced aggression for her and her infant from \nthe other group members or preferential access to food sources during the consortship \n(Palombit et al., 1997).  All these factors are likely to favour female mate choice and \nfemale-female competition for mating partners (Small, 1990; Vasey, 1998). Indeed, \nthere is some evidence that the mating season deteriorates female social relationships \nand increases competition among females (D\u2019Amato et al., 1982; Mehlman & Chapais, \n1988). \nUnder high competitive regimes, strict dominant hierarchies and rank-related \ndifferences in access to valuable resources are likely to evolve (Saito 1996; Whitten \n1988). In this context, group members are either friends or competitors so that animals \nparticularly benefit by exchanging grooming with only some partners (i.e. close-kin \n 4\nand\/or high-ranking animals) while ignoring the others (Dunbar, 1991; Janson 1988). \nStudies mainly conducted on macaques support this picture (Thierry, 2000). Despotic \nspecies (e.g. Japanese and rhesus macaques) are characterised by high levels of \ncompetition that result in steep hierarchies, grooming biased towards close-kin and\/or \nhigh-ranking animals, and low frequency of reconciliation with the average group \nmember (Matsumura, 1996; Sterck et al., 1997). Egalitarian species (e.g. crested \nmacaques), conversely, have low competitive regimes and relaxed hierarchies, \ngrooming is not significantly biased towards some animals and the average frequency of \nreconciliation is high.  \nBehavioural ecologists have usually concentrated their attention on how habitat \ncharacteristics and competitive regimes determine differences in social behaviour \namong species or populations (Henzi & Barrett, 2003). Conversely, short-term changes \nin the level of competition have rarely been analysed, although these may be \nparticularly important for species breeding seasonally, or for those affording large \nvariations in food abundance during the year. This lack of data also applies to studies on \nreconciliation and it is probably related to the scarcity of studies on this topic on wild \nanimals (Aureli & de Waal, 2000). This study thus aimed to analyse if and how short-\nterm changes in the level of competition affect frequency of reconciliation among \nfemale Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui). The Japanese macaques living on \nYakushima island are seasonal breeders and present large variations in their diet \ncomposition. During the summer months Yakushima macaques consume more fruits \nand seeds than in the winter and early spring months, while the reverse is true for the \nconsumption of leaves (Hanya et al. 2003; Hill 1997). Moreover, fruit- and seed-tree \nspecies are more clumped than leaf-tree species in Yakushima (Agetsuma, 1995). We \nthus predict that activity budgets should significantly vary during the year. Moreover, \n 5\ncontest food competition should be greater the higher the consumption of fruits and \nseeds is. Based on these predictions, we tested four different hypotheses: 1) Frequency \nof reconciliation should be lower the greater the level of contest food competition is; 2) \nFrequency of reconciliation should be lower during the mating season than during the \nnon-mating season; 3) Frequency of reconciliation should be higher between animals \nexchanging grooming (i.e. friends) than between animals not exchanging grooming (i.e. \nnon-friends); and 4) Frequency of reconciliation among female friends should increase, \nor at least remain stable, when the level of competition increases (as social partners are \nparticularly important under high competition) while the reverse should be true for \nreconciliation among female non-friends. To avoid confounding the effect of food \ncompetition and of the mating season on reconciliation, these two effects were analysed \nseparately. First, we analysed the effect of seasonal changes in food competition on \nreconciliation within the non-mating season. Second, we determined whether the level \nof food competition differed between the mating and the non-mating season. In case no \ndifference between these two periods was evident, we could reliably determine the \nimportance of the mating season on the frequency of reconciliation. \n \nMETHODS \nStudy Area and Subjects \nYakushima is a volcanic island of around 500 km2 located 60 km south of Kyushu, \nJapan (31\u00b0N, 131\u00b0E). The island is covered with a warm sub-tropical evergreen forest \non the coast (where the study area was), approximately up to 500 m a.s.l. (Agetsuma & \nNakagawa 1998). Temperature ranges from a minimum of about 3\u00b0C to a maximum of \nabout 32\u00b0C, rainfall is between 100 and 400 mm each month but it is higher than 400 \n 6\nmm in June, which is the peak of the rainy season (Hill, 1997). No natural predators are \npresent on the island (Maruhashi et al. 1998). \nSubjects of this study were eight females (age \u2265 4 years) living in Nina A group. At \nthe beginning of the study (June 2001) the group consisted of 13 sub-adult\/adult males, \n3 yearlings, 1 infant, plus the 8 females. Seven males (i.e. 6 sub-adult and 1 adult) \nemigrated from the study group during October 2001.  \n \nData Collection \nData were collected from June 13th 2001 to April 30th 2002 with only one \ninterruption from December 20th 2001 to January 15th 2002. Data on activity budgets \n(i.e. foraging, moving, grooming, or resting) and on the consumption of the two main \nfood categories (i.e. fruits and seeds or leaves) were collected using focal animal \nsampling (each observation session lasting 10 minutes; Altmann, 1974). Data were \ncollected from 7.00 to 19.00, approximately evenly on each study animal to avoid \nbiasing the sample. Preliminary data showed that conflicts over food were too rare \nwithin focal observations to allow statistical analyses. We thus collected ad libitum data \non aggressive interactions over food. Data on post-conflict behaviour were collected \nusing the post-conflict-matched-control (PC-MC) method (de Waal and Yoshihara, \n1983). Post-conflict sessions started within 30 seconds after an agonistic interaction \nbetween two or more females, on the victim or the aggressor, lasting 5 minutes. For \neach aggressive interaction, the identity of the animals involved, the intensity of the \nattack (i.e. threat, chase, slap, or bite), the context of conflict (i.e. foraging or grooming-\nresting) were recorded. Time elapsed (seconds) from the end of the conflict to the first \naffiliative interaction (i.e. grooming, lip-smacking, muzzle contact) between former \nopponents was recorded. On the next possible day, a matched-control observation was \n 7\nmade on the same animal and using the same sampling method. The session was \npostponed for at least 10 minutes if the focal animal was involved in an agonistic \ninteraction within 3 minutes before a planned MC (Aureli et al., 1993). The session only \nstarted when the context was similar to that of the PC and the other females involved in \nthe conflict were visible. If these conditions were not met within 2 weeks, the PC was \ndiscarded.  \n \nData Analysis \nData on activity budgets and diet composition are presented as percentage of time \nspent in each activity by the females. For each day, the number of conflicts over food \nwas divided by the hours of contact with the monkeys to obtain frequencies per hour per \nday. This figure was considered a reliable measure of the level of contest food \ncompetition among females (Isbell, 1991). \nReconciliation was never observed following conflicts over food (Majolo, 2004), \nsupporting the findings of previous studies (e.g. Aureli, 1992; Koyama, 2001; Verbeek \nand de Waal, 1997). Therefore, we decided to not include conflicts over food when \ncalculating conciliatory tendency (see below) but to analyse the level of contest food \ncompetition separately. We note here, however, that adding conflicts over food to the \nanalyses on conciliatory tendency did not alter our results.  \nEach PC-MC pair was assigned to one of the following three groups according to \nthe timing of the first affiliative interaction between former opponents in the two \nobservation sessions: 1) \u201cAttracted\u201d pair: affiliative interaction between former \nopponents was observed earlier in the PC than in the MC, or only in the PC; 2) \n\u201cDispersed\u201d pair: affiliative interaction between former opponents was observed later in \nthe PC than in the MC, or only in the MC; 3) \u201cNeutral\u201d pair: affiliative interaction \n 8\nbetween former opponents was observed at the same time in the PC and the MC, or was \nnever observed in the two sessions. Conciliatory tendency per female was measured \nfollowing the formula (Veenema et al., 1994):  \n(Number of \u201cattracted\u201d pairs \u2013 Number of \u201cdispersed\u201d pairs) \/  \nTotal number of pairs \nThe mating season (defined as the period between the first and last recorded \nconsortship in which sexual mounts were observed; Hanby and Brown, 1974) began on \n28th August and was finished by the time the data collection began again in January \n2002 (see above). First, we analysed the effect of food competition on reconciliation. \nWe thus compared data collected in the period June-August the 27th (hereafter, June-\nAugust for the sake of simplicity), when consumption of fruits and seeds was expected \nto be highest and that of leaves lowest (resulting in a high level of contest food \ncompetition), with data collected in January-April, where the reverse trend was \nexpected. Second, data collected in these two periods were pooled together, as they \nrepresented the non-mating season, and compared with data collected in the period \nSeptember-December, which represented the mating season. To analyse the effect of the \ntype of social relationship between former opponents on their conciliatory tendency we \ndivided the PC-MC pairs for each female in two groups: conflicts between friends were \nthose where the opponents were observed exchanging grooming during the study \nwhereas conflicts between non-friends were those where the opponents were never \nobserved exchanging grooming. Data on activity budgets, diet composition and \nconciliatory tendency were compared between the periods at the individual level using a \nseries of Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. Mann-Whitney test was used to \ncompare the daily level of contest food competition in the selected study periods.   \n \n 9\nRESULTS \nAt the end of the study period, a total of  204.9 hrs of focal observation were \ncollected, 51.2 hrs in June-August (6.4 \u00b1 0.2 mean hrs of observation per female \u00b1 SE), \n67.2 hrs in January-April (8.4 \u00b1 0.2 hrs per female), and 86.5 hrs (10.8 \u00b1 0.2 hrs per \nfemale) in the mating season. A total of 312 PC-MC pairs was collected: 95 in June-\nAugust (11.9 \u00b1 2.0 mean number of PC-MC pairs per female \u00b1 SE), 52 (6.5 \u00b1 1.2 PC-\nMC pairs per female) in January-April, and 156 (19.5 \u00b1 4.9 PC-MC pairs per female) \nduring the mating season. All the conflicts had a clear-cut result but two, in the period \nJanuary-April, when neither of the opponents showed any sign of submission. Only 4 \nconflicts, occurring in June-August, involved more than two females while all the other \nconflicts were dyadic. Victims of aggression were the subjects of further aggression \nfrom the former opponents in only 7 PC observations (i.e. 7.4%) occurring in the period \nJune-August, in 1 PC (i.e. 1.2%) during January-April, and in 12 PCs (i.e. 7.7%) during \nthe mating season. During PC observations victims were rarely observed to be \naggressive towards group members other than the former opponents: redirection was \nobserved in 3 PCs (i.e. 3.2%) in June-August, in 2 PCs (i.e. 3.8%) in January-April, and \nin 4 PCs (i.e. 2.6%) in the mating season. Given the rarity of these events, no statistical \nanalyses could be run on seasonal variations in alliance formation, agonistic support, \nfurther aggression from the former opponent, and redirection. \n \nThe Effect of Seasonal Changes of Activity Budgets, Diet Composition and \nFood Competition on Reconciliation \nMonkeys spent significantly less time foraging or moving in the period June-August \nthan in the period February-April (foraging: T = 36.0, N = 8, p < 0.01; moving: T = 37, \nN = 8, p < 0.01; see Figure 1). Conversely, time spent grooming was greater in June-\n 10\nAugust than in February-April (T = 37.0, N = 8, p < 0.01; see Figure 1). Time spent \nresting did not significantly differ between the two periods (T = 20, N = 8, NS; see \nFigure 1). As expected, the two periods also significantly differed in the consumption of \nthe main food categories. Monkeys spent more time foraging on fruits and seeds, and \nless time foraging on leaves in June-August than in February-April (time spent foraging \non fruits and seeds: T = 35.0, N = 8, p < 0.01; time spent foraging on leaves: T = 36.0, \nN = 8, p < 0.01; see Figure 1). However, contrary to our first prediction (see above) \nfrequency of conflicts over food did not significantly differ between the two periods \n(June-August: 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 events\/hr \u00b1 SE; January-April: 0.1 \u00b1 0.2 events\/hr \u00b1 SE; U = \n520.0, N1 = 32, N2 = 37, NS). \nConciliatory tendency did not differ when the periods June-August and January-\nApril were compared (T = 12.0, N = 6, NS; see Figure 2). Conciliatory tendency was \ncompared between the two periods according to the type of social relationship between \nformer opponents (i.e. friends or non-friends; see above). No difference was found for \nconciliatory tendency between friends in the two periods (June-August: 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mean \nconciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; January-April: 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; \nT = 19.0, N = 8, NS). A similar not significant result was found when conciliatory \ntendency between non-friends was compared between the two periods (June-August: \n0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; January-April: 0.1 \u00b1 0.2 mean conciliatory \ntendency \u00b1 SE; T = 3.5, N = 8, NS). Conciliatory tendency, however, did also not \nsignificantly differ between friends and non-friends in June-August (friends: 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 \nmean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; non-friends: 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 \nSE; T = 8.0, N = 8, NS) and in January-April (friends: 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mean conciliatory \ntendency \u00b1 SE; non-friends: 0.1 \u00b1 0.2 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; T = 14.0, N = \n8, NS). \n 11\n The Effect of the Mating Season on Reconciliation \nTime spent foraging was greater during the mating season than during the non-\nmating season (T = 36.0, N = 8, p < 0.01; see Figure 3). On the contrary, both time \nspent moving or resting were greater during the non-mating season than in the mating \nseason (time spent moving: T = 28.0, N = 8, p < 0.01; time spent resting: T = 20.0, N = \n8, p < 0.05; see Figure 3). Time spent grooming did not significantly differed between \nthe two periods (T = 9.0, N = 8, NS; see Figure 3). Monkeys spent a similar amount of \ntime foraging on fruits or seeds (T = 19.0, N = 8, p < 0.05; see Figure 3). However, time \nspent foraging on leaves was lower during the mating season than during the non-\nmating season (T = 36.0, N = 8, p < 0.01; see Figure 3). Mostly important, frequency of \nconflicts over food was similar in the two periods (mating season: 0.1 \u00b1 0.2 events\/hr \u00b1 \nSE; non-mating season: 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 events\/hr \u00b1 SE; U = 1713.5, N1 = 51, N2 = 69, NS). \nAs such, the effect of the mating season on reconciliation could be properly tested \nexcluding food competition as a possible confounding factor.  \nConfirming our prediction, conciliatory tendency was lower during the mating \nseason than during the non-mating season (T = 28.0, N = 8, p < 0.01; see Figure 4). To \ntest whether this result was due to female-female competition for mating partners we \ncompared conciliatory tendency when one or both the opponents were in oestrous and \nwhen they were not, within the mating season. We decided to use female hormonal state \nrather than female consortship as, otherwise, we would have lost important data on how \ncompetition for mating partners affects reconciliation. This is because an oestrus female \nis expected to spend most of her time trying to interact and mate with adult males \n(Mitsunaga et al., 1992), whereas whether or not she can actually consort with a male \ndepends on many other factors (e.g. male partner preference or availability of partners). \n 12\nIndeed, all conflicts observed when one or both the opponents were in oestrous \nconsisted of one female aggressively displacing the other who was interacting with a \nmale, or avoiding her from approaching a male. Confirming our previous finding, \nconciliatory tendency was significantly lower when one or both the opponents were in \noestrous than when they were not (T = 21, N = 7, p < 0.01; see Figure 4). No significant \ndifference was found when conciliatory tendency between friends was compared \nbetween the two periods (mating season: 0.2 \u00b1 0.0 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; \nnon-mating season: 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; T = 20.0, N = 8, NS). \nMoreover, conciliatory tendency between non-friends did not differ between the mating \nand the non-mating season (mating season: -0.0 \u00b1 0.0 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; \nnon-mating season: 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; T = 6.0, N = 8, NS). \nFinally, conciliatory tendency was similar for friends and non-friends in both the mating \nseason (friends: 0.2 \u00b1 0.0 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; non-friends: -0.03 \u00b1 0.0 \nmean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; T = 10.0, N = 8, NS) and the non-mating season \n(friends: 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mean conciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; non-friends: 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mean \nconciliatory tendency \u00b1 SE; T = 18.0, N = 8, NS). \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe Effect of Seasonal Changes of Activity Budgets, Diet Composition and \nFood Competition on Reconciliation \nPrimate socio-ecological theory predicts that habitat characteristics (e.g. food \nabundance and distribution) have profound effects on the activity budgets, type and \nlevel of food competition, and social relationships among group members (e.g. Janson \n1988; van Schaik, 1989; Sterck et al., 1997). This pattern also becomes evident in cross-\npopulation studies of species inhabiting a wide range of habitats. For example, the \n 13\nobserved variation in group size and composition, and in social organisation of baboons \nmay be explained by differences in habitat characteristics (Byrne et al., 1993; Henzi & \nBarrett, 2003). Although activity budgets and diet composition were significantly \ndifferent in the periods June-August and January-April, these factors did not have any \napparent effect on the level of food competition. The same non-significant result was \nobtained for conciliatory tendency. As such, we are unable to test the effect of short-\nterm changes in food competition on reconciliation. It is worth noticing, however, that \nreconciliation was unaffected by changes in activity budgets or diet composition \nbetween the two periods. This result has two not mutually exclusive explanations. First, \nconciliatory tendency may be relatively independent or resilient to mild and\/or short \nseasonal changes in diet composition that affect the time available for grooming \nexchange. Indeed, amicable social relationships (which results in higher conciliatory \ntendencies) may not need to be built or maintained on a day-to-day basis in animals \nwith a good memory, such as the Japanese macaques (van Schaik & Deaner, 2003). \nSecond, although significant, the differences in activity budgets and diet composition \nbetween the two periods may have been too short or of insufficient amplitude to affect \nsocial interactions and reconciliation among females. Indeed, grooming was never \nreduced below 20% of daily activity; still a conspicuous proportion of time in \ncomparison to other wild groups of primates (Henzi & Barrett, 2001). Moreover, the \ntime spent foraging on fruits and seeds never accounted for less than 50% of total time \nspent foraging while time spent foraging on leaves barely exceeded 20% of time in \nJanuary-April. Such observations indicate that females were never forced by ecological \nconstraints to significantly limit the time devoted to social activities nor did they \ncompletely switch from an essentially frugivorous diet in the summer months to a \n 14\nfolivorous diet in winter and early spring. This may also explain why food competition \ndid not differ between the two periods. \n \nThe Effect of the Mating Season on Reconciliation \nConfirming our prediction, this study showed that the mating season represents a \nperiod where conciliatory tendency among females is significantly reduced. The \nvariation of conciliatory tendency under different levels of competition, however, was \nnot affected by the type of social relationships existing between former opponents (i.e. \nfriends or non-friends). The reduction in conciliatory tendency was particularly evident \nwhen one or both opponents are in oestrous. These findings thus indicate that female \nsexual activity has more detrimental effects on social relationships and reconciliation \namong females than seasonal changes in activity budgets or diet composition. Such a \nconclusion is supported by other studies showing that, in seasonally breeding primates, \nthe mating season may greatly affect the distribution of allo-grooming among group \nmembers (D\u2019Amato et al., 1982; Mehlman & Chapais, 1988). This result was not \nunexpected if one consider the reproductive behaviour of the Japanese macaque. In this \nspecies consortships may last many days during which the male and female follow and \ngroom each other, and often copulate with sequential mounts (Enomoto, 1974). \nConsortships are thus time consuming for both males and females. During the mating \nseason females may not have much time left to interact with other females or, for \nlactating females, with their infants (Schino et al., 2001). Given that consortships are \ntime consuming, receptive females normally outnumber adult males in a group, and \nfemales may receive some benefits from consorting with dominant males (e.g. \nprotection from other aggressive individuals), female mate choice and female \ncompetition for mating partners seems to be important factors in macaque reproductive \n 15\nbehaviour (Small, 1990; Takahata et al., 1994). If this is true, mating partners, exactly \nlike food, are \u201cresources\u201d that cannot be shared by animals. A conflict between two \nfemales for access to an adult male during the mating season will always end with a win \nor lose result, other things being equal (e.g. male preference for a particular female \npartner). Under such circumstances, no room is left for negotiation and\/or cooperation \nbetween the opponents, and so reconciliation rarely takes place. These considerations \nexplain why reconciliation was never observed following conflicts over food in this \nstudy group (Majolo, 2004) and why conciliatory tendency was below zero when one or \nboth the opponents were in oestrous. Previous studies have suggested that the absence \nof reconciliation after conflicts over food does not have long-term detrimental effects on \nthe social relationship between former opponents (Aureli, 1992). Although our study \ndoes not address this issue, we may speculate that these detrimental effects are probably \nlimited to the mating season. Indeed, conciliatory tendency in the period immediately \nfollowing the end of the mating season (i.e. January-April) was similar to the period \npreceding it (i.e. June-August). If the mating season had any long-term effect on female \nsocial relationships, conciliatory tendency should have remained low in the period \nfollowing it. Whether or not this is true, the mating season represented a period where \nthe occurrence of reconciliation significantly decreased. We predict the effect of the \nmating season on conciliatory tendency being more evident in species or populations \nwith lower operational sex ratios and thus greater female competition for mating \npartners. \n \n 16\nACNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe Yakushima District Forestry Office kindly gave us permission to carry on the \nstudy.
