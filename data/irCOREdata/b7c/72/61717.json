Satellite radar altimetry can be used to \nmeasure elevation changes of ice sheets from which mass balance can be derived. In the \npercolation zone of ice sheets, summer melt which percolates into the snowpack and refreezes \ncauses a re-distribution of mass through densification, which can result in elevation changes \nwhich are not representative of changes in mass balance. We present data collected in the \npercolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet prior to and post the processes of summer melt, \npercolation and refreezing. Data from nine sites along two 1-km transects show that in 2004 there \nwas a 31.6% increase in accumulation over the summer, but due to surface melting percolation \nand refreezing the average snowpack density increased by 26.2%, resulting in only a 5.3% \nincrease in elevation. Our results indicate that in areas of substantial seasonal melt and \nrefreezing, densification rates must be accurately quantified if mass balance estimates are to be \nusefully derived from surface elevation change.  \n \nIntroduction  \nRecent reports suggest global warming is unequivocal (IPCC, 2007) and that future warming will \nbe enhanced at high latitudes. The Greenland Ice Sheet is the largest store of fresh water in the \nnorthern hemisphere and with the potential to raise sea level by 7 m, the effects of warming on its \nfuture are of great concern. Additionally, increased runoff from the ice sheet may affect the \nstrength of the ocean thermohaline circulation (Rahmstorf & Ganopolski, 1999) with potential \nconsequences for albedo and insulation feedbacks, related to the expanse of sea ice cover \n(Fichefet et al., 2003). Recent satellite observations indicate increased melt extent around the \nmargins of the ice sheet (Albert, 2002; Steffen et al., 2004) and any future warming will affect \nmass balance through surface melting and runoff and possibly through ice dynamics (Zwally et \nal., 2002). With warming in the Arctic estimated to be twice that of the global average (Trenberth \net al., 2007), 2\u201348C by 2040 (ACIA, 2005) there is a growing need to understand the likely \nresponse of the Greenland Ice Sheet to future climate change and to accurately monitor the \ncurrent changes in mass balance.  \nDue to problems of scale, the only viable approach to monitoring ice sheet mass balance is \nthrough the use of satellite observations where the instruments require calibration, often through \nground-truthing measurements. Accurate elevation changes over large areas of the polar ice \nsheets can be determined by repeat elevation measurements using satellite radar altimetry from \nwhich the mass balance can potentially be derived (Zwally et al., 2005). In the wet snow and \npercolation zones (Benson, 1962), however, seasonal changes in snow pack density result in a \nredistribution of mass through densification, meaning changes in surface elevation cannot be \ndirectly correlated with changes in mass. A decrease in elevation may be caused by surface melt, \npercolation and refreezing (Pfeffer et al., 1991), but with no mass loss (Braithwaite et al., 1994). \nSimilarly, there may be positive summer accumulation in the form of rain or solid precipitation \nwhich melts and refreezes, thus causing an increase in snowpack density and mass, but little \nchange in surface elevation.  \nThe European Space Agency\u2019s \u2018CryoSat 2\u2019 mission, due for launch in 2009, is set to observe the \npolar regions through satellite radar altimetry. The aim of the mission is to measure elevation \nchanges over land-based ice masses and interpret these changes in terms of mass loss or gain \n(ESA, 2007), thus improving our understanding of the response of the Earth\u2019s ice masses to \nclimate change. In this paper we present field data collected from the percolation zone of the \nGreenland Ice Sheet to provide ground calibration for the satellite measurements to quantify the \neffect of the seasonal densification of near surface snow and firn on both surface elevation \nchange and annual mass balance.  \nField Sites and Methods  \nFieldwork was undertaken at *1945 m elevation in the percolation zone of the Greenland Ice \nSheet in the region of T05 (698 51N, 478 15W) on the EGIG (Expedition Glaciologique \nInternational au Groenland) line (Figure 1). In order to investigate variability in near-surface \ndensity and stratigraphy, snowpit measurements were made along two perpendicular transects. \nThese were centred at T05, and an additional eight sites were investigated at intervals of 1 m, 10 \nm, 100 m and 1 km from T05 along both transects: transect E, aligned in a east-north-easterly \ndirection along the EGIG line towards the centre of the ice sheet (measurement locations E1, E2, \nE3 and E4), and Transect S, aligned in a south-south-easterly direction perpendicular to the \nEGIG line (measurement locations S1, S2, S3 and S4) (Figure 1).  \nTo determine the seasonal change in density in the near-surface snowpack, measurements to \ncharacterise the snow\/firn at each location were carried out during both the spring (pre-melt) and \nautumn (post-melt, percolation and re-freezing) of 2004. Snow pits were dug at each site down to \nthe surface layer demarcating the end of the 2003 summer. In spring 2004 this layer was easily \nidentified as a hard, icy and continuous layer located beneath the autumn hoar and was used as a \nreference surface for the bottom of all snow pits. Once this layer was identified in spring, ablation \nstakes were emplaced and used as markers to ensure this same horizon was used as a common \nreference for any depth change identified upon re-measurement in the autumn.  \nThe stratigraphic recognition of all individual layers was determined visually (Colbeck et al., \n1990) and using a semi-quantitative assessment of hardness (fist, finger, pencil or knife) carried \nout at 10 mm intervals down each profile. Density measurements were taken from each layer \nusing one of three tubes of differing diameter. The largest tube that could be pushed into an \nindividual stratigraphic layer was used to extract a known volume of snow (57 cm\n3\n, 161 cm\n3 \nor \n227 cm\n3\n) which was then weighed using a Newton balance to obtain density. Repeat \nmeasurements from stratigraphic layers were taken and averaged, and variability was found to be \n2\u20133% for the large and medium sized tubes, and 17% for the small tube. Ice layers, lenses and \npipes were also recorded in the stratigraphy. These ice features were allocated a density of 0.8 g \ncm\n-3 \nsince it was not possible to measure their density directly in the field and the ice was often \nobserved to contain bubbles.  \nResults and Discussion  \nThe mean snowpack depth at the nine sites located within 1 km\n2 \nof T05 was 143.2 cm (standard \ndeviation (s.d.) 4.0 cm) in spring and 150.8 cm (s.d. 11.7) in autumn, yielding a mean summer \nincrease in pit depth of 5.3% (Figure 2). The average density of the snowpack increased at all \nsnowpits between spring and autumn (Figure 3). The mean snowpack density of all sites was \n0.42 g cm\n-3 \n(s.d. 0.02) in spring and 0.53 g cm\n-3 \n(s.d. 0.04) in autumn, yielding a mean summer \nincrease in density of 26.2%. The average snowpit accumulation expressed as a depth of water \nequivalent (w.e.) therefore increased from 60.5 cm (s.d. 3.4), in the spring to 79.6 cm (s.d. 5.5) in \nthe autumn, an increase of 31.6% (Figure 4).  \nThese density increases result primarily from surface melting, meltwater percolation and \nsubsequent refreezing at depth within the surface snow pack. The fact that densities increased \nsubstantially without any decrease in snow depth results from additional mass inputs as summer \nprecipitation in the form of snow or rain. In addition, snow compaction during warmer summer \ntemperatures also contributes to increased densities. This densification of the snowpack has \nimplications for mass balance derived from elevation change. For example; for 1 m of snow, \nprior to melt, with an average density of 420 kg m\n-3\n, the w.e. is 0.42 m. If the water equivalent \nremains constant (i.e. assuming no summer accumulation, or loss of mass), but the pack increases \nin density by 110 kg m\n-3\nto530 kgm\n-3\n, the height of the snowpack will be reduced by 21 cm to \n0.79 m, which would be measured by satellite observations of elevation change, and could be \nmisinterpreted as a loss of mass. Thomas et al. (2008) show that above 2000 m, a 1 cm elevation \nchange represents approximately a 1 Gt mass change and given that the mass balance of the \nGreenland Ice Sheet above 2000 m is +53 \u00b1 2Gt a \n-1 \n(Zwally et al., 2005), neglecting to account \nfor seasonal densification of the snowpack may result in significant errors. Our results indicate \nthat a better calibration of the processes causing densification is required if improved estimates of \nice sheet mass balance are to be derived from satellite radar altimeters. Braithwaite et al. (1994) \nshow that firn density is related to annual melt and accumulation, and the decrease in melt with \nelevation subsequently causes a decrease in firn density with elevation. Li et al. (2007) also \nidentify winter temperatures as having an impact on densification rates and with projections for \nwinter temperatures to be warming at four times the global average (Christensen et al., 2007), \nlonger term seasonal variations in densification processes will also become an important factor in \nmass balance measurements derived from elevation changes.  \n \nConclusion  \nMeasurements of snowpack depth and density, made before and after summer melting, were \ncarried out in the percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet in spring and autumn 2004. Results \nshow that between spring and autumn 2004, there was an overall mass increase of the snowpack \nof 31.6% but that this is not reflected in the small average increase in snowpack depth of 5.3%. \nThis is due to the increase in mean snowpack density of an average 26.2% over the same period.  \nOur results demonstrate that significant changes in density between seasons can result in very \nlimited changes in surface elevation, despite significant changes in mass. Thus, in areas such as \nthe percolation zone, where the snowpack shows substantial seasonal changes in density, mass \nbalance estimates should not be based solely on observed changes in surface elevation.  \n \nAcknowledgements  \nThis paper is a contribution to the validation of the ESA CryoSat.
