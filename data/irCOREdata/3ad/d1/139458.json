Water has a transmission window in the visible and\nultraviolet, enabling spectroscopic determination of a number of compounds. Measurands of interest\ninclude residual chlorine, the visible color of the water (for aesthetic quality) and the general level of\norganic compounds (total organic carbon). Many detectors of metal ions and some recently developed pH\nmeters use colorimetric methods involving reactive dyes. Potassium permanganate, chosen for this work as\na representative absorption standard, is also sometimes used for disinfection of treated water.\nPhotothermal detection of trace chemicals in water has a number of advantages over conventional\ntransmission spectroscopy, chiefly a high signal to noise ratio and relative insensitivity to light scattering\nwithin the sample [1,2]. However, much recent work has involved the use of high power cw or pulsed lasers,\n2the latter to remove window noise by time gating the signal [3]. The use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) as\nlow-cost, reliable light sources has so far been restricted to solid samples[4,5] and gases[6]. These sources\nmay be electronically modulated over a wide range of frequencies, avoiding the additional acoustic noise at\nthe modulation frequency which would be expected when using a mechanical chopper. In this paper we\nreport, as an example, the photothermal detection of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in aqueous solution\nusing three visible LEDs.\n2 Experimental\nA novel closed-cell photothermal detector has been designed, suitable for measurement of aqueous samples\nusing low power, cw light sources. The system has been described in greater detail[7], but the essential\ncharacteristics are presented here. The stainless steel cell had a cylindrical internal bore of length 50mm and\nradius 10mm. A flat, horizontal water meniscus was employed as a sensor, constrained by surface forces at\na 200\uf06dm radius pinhole in nickel foil. Photothermal absorption of modulated light resulted in periodic\npressure changes in the cell, which caused the meniscus to be deflected like a thin diaphragm, its curvature\nvarying with the excess pressure in the cell. Vertical movement of the centre of the meniscus was detected\nusing fiber optic interferometry. A schematic diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the system used for photothermal detection.\nZero mean pressure difference across the meniscus was maintained by a slow hydraulic leak to an outside\nreservoir, which equalised internal and external pressures at frequencies of less than ~5Hz, much lower\nthan the photothermal modulation frequency. This arrangement kept the meniscus approximately flat, with\nsmall deflections from the mean position. An expanded view of the 400\uf06dm diameter meniscus and the\n3125\uf06dm diameter cleaved optical fiber end, which together formed the interferometer cavity, is shown in\nFigure 2. A distance of approximately 60\uf06dm was maintained between the two, to prevent accidental\ncontact. While this reduced the coupling efficiency of the reflected light into the fiber, the sensitivity of the\nphotothermal measurements was not affected.\nFigure 2. Interferometer formed by the cleaved optical fiber and the meniscus.\nThe full interferometer system is shown in Figure 3. Phase quadrature was maintained in the interferometer\nusing a piezoelectric bimorph element (Quantelec EB-T-320), which moved the cleaved fiber end in\nrelation to the meniscus. A feedback control circuit maintained a predetermined dc output from the\ninterferometer receiver by applying a variable voltage to the bimorph, thus mechanically tracking an\ninterference fringe edge. The photodiode at (2) was connected to a transimpedance amplifier, giving a\nvoltage signal v which was converted to a displacement d using the formula;\nThe value of the scale factor A (in volts) was determined by observation of the full-height fringes formed by\nlarge changes of optical phase.\nFigure 3. Low finesse fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer, used to detect the relative position of the meniscus.\nA\uf070\n\uf06c\n\uf064\uf064\n4\n.v=d (1)\n4The interferometer was used to measure the relative meniscus displacement with an rms noise floor at 70\nHz of 10 pm Hz-1\/2, which was a factor of 10 above the noise floor of an interferometer formed by the same\ncleaved fiber end and a firmly bonded silica test plate. This implies that the noise floor was due to random\ndeflections of the meniscus itself, believed to be a result of environmental acoustic noise.\nA piezoelectric element on the side of the cell, made of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) was used to modulate\nthe cell volume for test purposes (Morgan Matroc PZT-5A, 0.48mm thick, 10mm square, bonded to a 6mm\ndiameter hole in the cell wall). Applying a voltage across the cell PZT resulted in a large meniscus\ndeflection, whose magnitude was proportional to the applied voltage.\nThe plastic lens on the front of each LED was polished flat, as close as possible to the LED chip itself. The\nback and sides of each package were painted black to reduce stray light. Otherwise, spurious signals could\nhave resulted from stray light hitting and being absorbed by the cell walls. The light output was coupled\ninto the photothermal cell using an f\/3.2 lens. Each LED was driven using a square-wave voltage from a\nsignal generator (Thurlby Thandar TG220) with a 220\uf057 resistor in series to give a peak drive current of\n30mA. 70Hz was chosen as the preferred modulation frequency because the measurement signal to noise\nratio was a maximum at this frequency. Signals from the interferometer were passed through a high pass\nfilter \/ amplifier (EG&G model 5113, amplification \uf0b410 for frequencies > 1Hz, 12 dB \/ decade roll-off filter\nfor lower frequencies). A lock-in amplifier (EG&G model 5210) in R, \uf071mode with a 100s integration time\nwas used to detect signals synchronous with the modulation. A digital storage oscilloscope (Hitachi VC-\n6175) was used to record the shapes of photothermal signals.\nLED emission intensity was measured using a large area silicon photodiode (Centronic OST100\/7CQ) in\nthe position normally occupied by the cell. The photodiode current was related to the incident light\nintensity, using the manufacturer\u2019s quoted responsivity at each wavelength with an estimated absolute error\nof 15%. The quoted responsivity at 780nm was checked using a commercial fiber optic power meter\n(Megger OTP 510, also incorporating a silicon photodiode).\nThe measured peak-to-peak modulated light intensities and peak absorbed wavelengths of each LED are\nshown in Table 1. The peak absorbed wavelength may be displaced slightly from the peak emitted\nwavelength because of the shape of the permanganate absorption spectrum. For the purpose of estimating\nthe magnitude of the photothermal signal, it was assumed that the LED emission was all at the peak\nabsorbed wavelength.\n5Table 1.

KMnO4 is known to be a good standard for use as a\nphotothermal absorber, because it doesn't fluoresce, phosphoresce or undergo photochemical reactions\nwhen excited in the visible, and therefore delivers absorbed energy quickly to the solvent as heat[8].\nG R\n500 600 700 800\n0.05\n0.1\nab\nso\nrp\ntio\nn\nco\nef\nf\/\ncm\n-1\n0\nB\nwavelength \/ nm\n300 400200\nFigure 4. Absorption spectrum of 5ppm KMnO4 in solution (solid line), with the normalized emission\nspectra of blue, green and red LEDs superimposed (dashed lines) all determined using a diode array\nspectrometer.\nKMnO4 solutions were prepared by dilution of a known quantity of the solid. Signals from a range of\nsolutions strengths were recorded for excitation by each LED. The diode array spectrometer was used to\nmeasure the absorption of KMnO4 in each sample, at each of the LED peak wavelengths. The five weakest\nsolutions had too low an absorption coefficient at 478nm and 658nm to be accurately measured in this way,\nso the absorption was calculated by reference to that measured at 530nm, corresponding to an absorption\npeak.\n6The experimental procedure was as follows. The cell was filled with a test solution and the interferometer\naligned by eye to the center of the meniscus using an xyz stage. A sinusoidal voltage of approximately 10V\npeak-to-peak was applied to the cell PZT in order to modulate the cell volume. The resulting periodic\nmeniscus displacement produced interference fringes which were used to align the fiber more precisely to\nthe position of maximum meniscus movement. The interference fringes were also used to determine the\ncorrect quadrature setpoint for the phase controller.\nTwo scale factors were recorded for each measurement, namely the interference fringe depth and the\nvoltage required, across the cell PZT, to move the meniscus by two interference fringes (783nm). The latter\nprovided an approximate measure of the response of the system to a given volume change and proved\nuseful in detecting the undesirable presence of large air bubbles in the cell, which would have reduced the\nsignal. It would also account for any changes in the surface tension of the water at the meniscus, due for\nexample to the presence of impurities such as surfactants. Finally, the sinusoidal voltage across the cell\nPZT was removed and the system was ready to make measurements.\nPhotothermal signals have a strong temperature dependence in water, which was expected to be\napproximately linear over our working range (20-25\uf0b0C), falling to zero at 4\uf045C [1]. The ambient temperature\nwas measured during each measurement. It was assumed that the KMnO4 solutions had reached thermal\nequilibrium with the surroundings, and that any temperature increase during each measurement was\nnegligible.\nThe voltage measurements were converted to a meniscus displacement in nm, using the measured fringe\ndepth and assuming that phase quadrature was maintained. The results were further normalized for\ndifferences in ambient temperature and in the cell responsivity, as measured by finding the voltage applied\nacross the cell PZT which was required to move the meniscus by a known distance.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Magnitude and form of photothermal signals\nThe green LED, whose emission corresponded approximately to an absorption maximum of KMnO4, was\nused with a strongly absorbing solution to investigate the frequency response of the system and the form\nand magnitude of photothermal signals. The shape and magnitude of the modulated emission waveform\nfrom the LED were found to be constant over the frequency range of these experiments. The shapes of the\n7photothermal signals at various frequencies were recorded using the digital storage oscilloscope as averages\nover 256 traces, and are shown in Figure 5.\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n2\n4\ntime \/ ms\ndi\nsp\nla\nce\nm\nen\nt\/\nnm (a) 21 Hz\n0 10 20 30\npredicted\nexperimental\n0\n1\n2\ntime \/ ms\ndi\nsp\nla\nce\nm\nen\nt\/\nnm\n(b) 69 Hz\n40 50\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n1\n2\ntime \/ ms\ndi\nsp\nla\nce\nm\nen\nt\/\nnm (c) 700 Hz\n\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be meniscus deflection \uf02d \uf02d \uf02d \uf02d modulation signal (rescaled)\nFigure 5. Photothermal signals resulting from absorption of light from a green LED in a 50ppm solution\nof KMnO4.\nThe expected shape and size of the meniscus displacement, for a given energy input, have been\ncalculated in the Appendix. For a KMnO4 concentration of 3\uf0b410-4 M, it was expected that over 99.7%\nof the light would be absorbed, over the fwhm range of LED emission. A sawtooth meniscus deflection\nwas predicted by equation (7) for square wave excitation, giving a displacement per unit absorbed\nenergy of \uf044h = 4\uf0b410-4 m J-1. The predicted photothermal signal has been calculated from the measured\nLED emission, with an estimated error of 15%. That and the actual signal recorded by a digital storage\noscilloscope (averaged over 256 traces) are shown in Figure 5 (b). They are in good agreement.\n8The frequency response of photothermal signals, from the same solution, is shown in Figure 6. For\nphotothermal signals, a 1\/f response is predicted. The results are in good agreement with this, except for a\ndistinct resonance observed at 700Hz. There was no observed gain in signal to noise ratio associated with\nmodulation at 700Hz, because the noise level was also increased at the resonant frequency. The precise\norigin of the resonance was not determined, but it was experimentally confirmed to be associated with the\nwater meniscus, the water in the cell and the cell PZT.\n10 100 103 104\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\nfrequency \/ Hz\nrm\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\nmeasured\n1\/f response\nFigure 6. Frequency response for photothermal signals produced when modulated light from a green\nLED was absorbed by a 50ppm solution of KMnO4.\nThe resonant signal in Figure 5 (c) is clearly different from that of the lower frequency signals, in that it is\nsinusoidal and has undergone a phase shift of approximately -90\uf0b0 with respect to the lower frequency\nsignals. The same resonance can also be seen, at lower frequency modulation, as a small ripple in Figure 5\n(b). The form of Figure 5 (a) indicates a degree of high pass filtering, with a time constant of the order of\n20ms, which is too small to have been caused by either the hydraulic leak, the phase controller, or the high\npass filters used on both the oscilloscope and the EG&G filter \/ amplifier. However, the combination of all\nfour filters could have created an effective 3dB cut-off at a higher frequency.\n3.2 Detection of KMnO4 in aqueous solution\nThe three LEDs, modulated at 70Hz, were each used to excite photothermal signals in a range of aqueous\nsolutions of KMnO4. The signals, converted to rms meniscus displacements, are shown in Figure 7 versus\nthe absorption coefficients of the various levels of KMnO4 in solution. Three types of behaviour were\nexpected from equation (7). At very low concentrations of KMnO4, the absorption of the water itself\nshould dominate. Whether or not the presence of KMnO4 can be determined depends on the repeatability\nof the photothermal measurement, because absorption changes smaller than the background water\nabsorption can only be discerned by subtraction of a blank reference measurement for pure water. At\nintermediate absorptions the permanganate should dominate, and the photothermal signal should be\nproportional to the concentration of KMnO4. At high concentrations, with values of \uf061 above 0.1cm-1 for a\n95cm pathlength, a nonlinear dependence on \uf061 should emerge and the photothermal signal should converge\nto its maximum possible value. If the photothermal signal is plotted against the fraction of light absorbed, a\nlinear dependence should be observed above the noise level, even at high KMnO4 concentrations.\n10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-4\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n(a) Blue LED, 478nm\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-4\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nfraction of light absorbed\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\nabsorption coefficient \/ cm-1\n10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nabsorption coefficient \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\ns\nde\nfle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nfraction of light absorbed\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n(b) Green LED, 524nm\n10-710-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n(c) Red LED, 658nm\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nfraction of light absorbed\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\nabsorption coefficient \/ cm-1\nFigure 7. Photothermal signals from KMnO4 solutions (solid line) and from deionised water controls\n(dashed line), versus the absorption coefficients and fractional light absorption of KMnO4 at each\nwavelength.\nIn each case the form of the graph is as expected, with an approximately linear increase in photothermal\nsignal with absorption coefficient for values of \uf061 above that of water and below the point of saturation of\n10\nthe signal. The main sources of error in the data were as follows. At low absorptions, random noise in the\ninterferometer signal, estimated to be 10 pm Hz-1\/2, gave a 1pm random uncertainty in the results for a 100s\nmeasurement period. Secondly, interference fringe drift resulted in uncertainty in the value of the scale\nfactor A used to calculate the meniscus deflections using equation (1). This produced an error of\napproximately 10% in each result.\nThe performance of our system in detecting trace levels of absorption in water depended on the\nphotothermal modulation frequency (70Hz in each case), the limiting noise level, the light power coupled\ninto the cell from the source and the background level of water absorption. The limiting noise was the\nminimum detectable meniscus deflection of 1pm. Equation (8) predicts the resulting minimum detectable\nabsorption coefficients, which are given in Table 2, for each LED. Also shown is the expected background\nlevel of water absorption, as recorded by Patel and Tam using a pulsed photothermal method[3].\nTable 2.

However, the absorption coefficient of water itself at 658nm is higher than the predicted\nminimum detectable \uf061 for the red LED. In this case, the predicted performance could only be achieved by\narithmetic subtraction of the blank reference signal due to deionised water, as shown in Figure 8. An\nestimate of the measurement repeatability, the value of one standard deviation in the measured results for\nwater, is shown as a dashed line.\n11\n0\nKMnO4\n5\uf0b410-4\nwater\n(1\uf073)\n10-3 1.5\uf0b410-3\n0\n5\nabsorption coeff. \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/p\nm\nFigure 8. Photothermal meniscus deflection results excited by a 658nm LED, following subtraction of\nthe mean measured meniscus deflection for a deionised water control.\nThus, for each of the three measurements of KMnO4 concentration in deionised water, the meniscus\ndeflection noise floor of 1 pm limits the minimum detectable absorption. The fact that this limit is\ndetermined by random displacement of the meniscus suggests that improvements may be gained by greater\nsuppression of environmental acoustic noise. Alternatively, under some circumstances, longer\nmeasurement integration periods might be desirable. Photothermal window noise does not appear to have\nbeen significant, perhaps due to our choice of sapphire as the window material. Sapphire is reported to\nhave thermal transfer properties which result in lower window noise levels than are produced using other\ncommon window materials, such as silica[1].\n4 Conclusion\nPhotothermal detection of trace quantities of potassium permanganate in aqueous solution has been\ndemonstrated, using three LEDs emitting visible light at different wavelengths. Potassium permanganate is\na good photothermal standard, enabling our results to be transferred to other compounds. The system used\na water meniscus as a pressure sensor, of optimum compliance approximately equal to the bulk compliance\nof the water enclosed by the cell. Meniscus deflections were detected using an optical fiber Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer.\nThe technique was limited by environmental acoustic noise which gave a noise floor, in terms of rms\nmeniscus displacement, of 10 pm Hz-1\/2. For a measurement integration time of 100s, this limit was\nequivalent to a minimum detectable absorbed power of 0.25 \uf06dW rms. The minimum detectable absorption\n12\ncoefficient depended on the emitted power of the light sources; in our case the limit was of the order of\n2\uf0b410-4 cm-1.\nThe magnitude and shape of photothermal signals were found to be in good agreement with theory. The\nfrequency response of the technique showed a 1\/f relationship, with a resonance at approximately 700Hz.\nHowever, the resonance was not exploited during our experiments because the signal to noise ratio was not\nenhanced.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by North West Water Ltd and the EPSRC \/ Department of Trade and Industry,\nthrough the UK Teaching Company Scheme.\nReferences\n1.

This is used to calculate the magnitude of the photothermal response, and the optimum\nvalue of the meniscus radius is found. Finally, the magnitude of the signal from the fiber optic\ninterferometer is calculated.\nThe compliances (\uf0b6V\/\uf0b6P) of different cell elements are additive, and may be considered one by one. The\ncompliance of the water enclosed by the cell may be calculated from the definition of its bulk modulus \uf06b\nand the internal volume of the cell Vc.\nThe compliance of the meniscus may be found by considering the excess pressure across the curved\nmeniscus and by calculating the volume of displaced fluid. For small deflections from a flat surface, the\nmeniscus compliance is approximately linear with respect to \uf071, and the expression converges to the\nfollowing;\nwhere \uf067 is the surface tension of the fluid. When a cylindrical region of fluid lying in the optical path\nabsorbs a small amount of light energy \uf064E, its unconstrained volume increase would be,\n\uf06b\ncV=\nP\nV\nwater\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 (2)\n\uf067\n\uf070\n8\n4\nmeniscus\na=\nP\nV\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n(3)\n14\n\uf072\n\uf064\uf062\n\uf064\nC\nEV\np\n\uf03d (4)\nwhere \uf062 is the volume thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid, Cp is its specific heat capacity and \uf072 is its\ndensity. The pressure increase in a closed cell on absorption of energy \uf064E is thus given by equation (4) and\nthe total cell compliance.\nThe displacement of the center of the flat meniscus from its mean position, \uf044h, is a function of the excess\npressure across it, which for small pressure changes approximates to the following linear expression;\nThe change in \uf044h with absorbed energy E is then given by;\nThe optimum meniscus, for maximum displacement response to absorbed energy, has a radius which makes\nits compliance equal to the bulk compliance of the water enclosed by the cell. In this case, the optimum\nradius is 200\uf06dm[7], giving a response to absorbed energy of \uf044h = 4\uf0b410-4 m J-1.\nThe absorbed energy is given by Beer\u2019s Law. For small absorption coefficients, E is approximately\nproportional to \uf061, the absorption coefficient. For square wave modulation of the light at a frequency f, the\nabsorbed energy takes the form of a sawtooth, plus a ramp component. Since our method subtracts the\nramp component from the signal, we may ignore it. The meniscus deflection then simply takes the form of\na sawtooth, with the peak-to-peak displacement given by the following equation;\nwhere I0 is the peak incident light power, \uf061(\uf06c) is the absorption coefficient, in cm-1 at a particular\nwavelength \uf06c and \uf06c is the pathlength of the cell in cm. For small \uf044h, the relationship between the\nminimum detectable absorption coefficient and the rms minimum detectable meniscus deflection is\napproximated by;\n\uf0674\n2 Pa\n=h\n\uf044\n\uf044 (5)\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf044\uf0b6\n\uf067\n\uf070\n\uf06b\n\uf067\uf072\n\uf062\n8\n4aV\n1\nC4\na=\nE\nh\ncp\n2\n(6)\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\uf06c\uf06c\uf061\uf02d\uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\uf044 \uf02d\n\uf02d\n101\nf2\n104 04\nI\nh pp (7)\n\uf06c0\nrms4\nmin\nf\n10\nI\nh\uf044\n\uf0bb\uf061 (8)\n"}
