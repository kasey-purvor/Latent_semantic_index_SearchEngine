Over\nthe past forty years, IRSCL\u2019s congresses have pursued the ideal of research as\nan exchange of ideas between researchers in different countries and in different\nbranches of learning. The Society was founded at the Frankfurt Colloquium\nof 1969, and thus at an early moment in what we now think of as \u2018the age\nof theory\u2019, and the Society\u2019s various intellectual exchanges \u2013 and, it must be\nsaid, controversies \u2013 were often shaped by this context. At present, scholarship\nis \u2013 arguably \u2013 less dominated by methodological prescriptiveness than it was in\nthe last decades of the twentieth century, and very concerned with finding a way\nforward. It can neither retreat to some idealised pre-1969 condition, nor slough\noff the past forty years to invent something entirely new. Its condition is well\nreflected by a remark by David Scott Kastan in Shakespeare after Theory (1999):\nThe great age of theory is over [. . . ] but not because theory has been discredited;\non the contrary, it is precisely because its claims have proven so compelling and\nproductive. [. . . ] If theory has convincingly demonstrated that meaning is not\nimmanent but rather situational, or, put differently, that both reading and writing\nare not unmediated activities but take place only and always in context and\naction, the specific situations, contexts and actions \u2013 that is, the actual historical\ncircumstances of literary production and reception \u2013 cannot be merely gestured\nat but must be recovered and analyzed. (31\u20132)\nScholarship in many fields, including children\u2019s literature, has consequently\nturned to concrete, pragmatic, or historical grounds for arguments about\ntexts and culture, and there seems little doubt that for the foreseeable future\ninterpretation will be linked to context. In saying this, we are not advocating a\nna\u00efve empiricism or historicism: the scholarly project that resolves a research\nquestion through analysis of accumulated data will now be aware of its\nown historical situatedness and social and ethical assumptions. Protocols of\ninterpretation will continue to be shaped by the perspectives explored during the\n\u2018age of theory\u2019, but there is also a unique opportunity to pursue dialogues with\nacademic cultures hitherto only sporadically represented (if at all) in international\nchildren\u2019s literature scholarship.\nThis issue of IRCL, like the preceding issues, is distinguished by the wide\nrange of countries and cultures represented by its contributors; and it is published\nas IRSCL welcomes to its anniversary celebrations in Frankfurt many delegates\nfrom countries new to IRSCL congresses, as well as those who have been mem-\nbers since its inaugural years. This breadth of representation not only testifies to\nthe robust internationalism of the journal, and of IRSCL itself, but to the diverse\nconceptions of relevant contexts and critical discourses that frame the articles\nhere. A common strategy amongst contributors is to invoke historical context\nas frame for discussion of themes in the work of authors: both contemporary,\nvi Editor ia l\nas in Helma van Lierop-Debrauwer\u2019s study of children\u2019s books about religion,\nor Roni Natov\u2019s reflections on Louise Erdrich\u2019s stories of early America, and\nfrom the past, as in Elisabeth Wesseling\u2019s reassessment of the supposed racial\nstereotypes in Heinrich Hoffmann. But the historical context within which a\nwork is produced and consumed furnishes only a limited account of causality and\ntextuality, and may reduce complex works to merely symptomatic or evidential\nobjects. In her close attention to textuality, Elisabeth Wesseling demonstrates\nhow the historical context must be used to do both more and less than this. Any\nventure of interpretation involves diverse acts of translation, and, as children\u2019s\nliterature scholars have long been aware, even seemingly simple and accessible\ntexts open up questions about embedded cultural assumptions, whether of their\nconditions of production or of the moment of reading. So, in her study of three\ndifferent language versions of a Japanese picture book, Tatsuko Ochiai brings\ntogether historical contexts of production and reception, paying close attention\nto visual images and linguistic forms, to explore how such meanings change as\na text is transposed from one culture to another. In tracing such migrations, the\nprocesses of recovery of lost or forgotten texts remain important to children\u2019s\nliterature studies. In IRCL\u2019s new \u2018Notes\u2019 section, Kazunari Takaya presents his\ndiscovery of a hitherto unknown Japanese translation of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Sylvie\nand Bruno; and many of the reviews, too, bear witness to continuing programmes\nof archival research, retrieval and re-evaluation.\nContext may also be a pressing issue in contemporary social ideology and\npractice. In the paper which opens this issue, Michelle Ann Abate weighs the\npolitical context and overt agenda of a fundamentalist, evangelical Christian\nfiction series from the United States. The authoritarian, anti-humanist, and\nmonocultural vision that informs this series, and its authors\u2019 conviction of their\nown absolute truth, represents almost everything antithetical to international\nresearch in children\u2019s literature. In the context of the papers gathered in this\nissue, its effect is to highlight an alternative conviction that underpins the\narguments of, for example, Yvonne Hammer, Judith Inggs and Helma van\nLierop-Debrauwer: it is in our responsiveness to the needs and very consciousness\nof other subjectivities that we ground our being as ethical subjects and find a\nbasis for whatever acts of intervention we may contemplate. Context for Yvonne\nHammer is thus not only the social fact and limited agency of homeless children\nbut also contemporary understandings of cognition and intersubjectivity through\nwhich one subject interacts with another. A comparable perspective informs\nShelley Chappell\u2019s study of the werewolf figure in contemporary children\u2019s\nfiction. In mapping significant shifts in a specific fantastic genre, she argues\nthat such figurative representations of otherness embody a positive ideological\nshift in conceptions of race and ethnicity, but also, as a metaphor for \u2018the\nstranger, foreigner and minority ethnic and racial group\u2019, disclose a persistent\nethnocentrism.\nIn the monologic rants of the US series sounded in Michelle Ann\nAbate\u2019s article, as, for example, though in a less strident key, in some of\nthe earlier Protestant texts of religious instruction discussed by Helma van\nEditor ia l vii\nLierop-Debrauwer, children and young adults themselves figure as the stranger,\nthe monstrous even \u2013 dangerous elements, to be tamed and brought into line.\nAs we prepare this issue of the journal for publication, newspapers in the\nUK are humming with fresh debate about the security device, the \u2018Mosquito\nTeen Deterrent\u2019 \u2013 a high-frequency sound-device, audible only to the young,\nincreasingly used to discourage groups of teenagers from hanging around in\npublic places. The counter \u2018Buzz Off Campaign\u2019, called by the Commissioner\nfor England\u2019s 11 million children, has reinvigorated discussion about children\u2019s\nrights, in what the prominent psychologist and TV presenter, Tanya Byron, has\ncalled an \u2018ephebiphobic culture\u2019. If youth itself is seen as a pestilence, so too,\nthe apocalyptic plagues of modern times, that loom large in the jeremiad of the\n\u2018Left Behind\u2019 series, are part of the habitat and hazards negotiated by many\nof the young protagonists in other fictions canvassed here: homelessness, sexual\nabuse, HIV\/AIDS, death and old age, nuclear war. So, a movement traced,\nacross a range of children\u2019s literature, in all our issues on the theme of \u2018Power\nin Children\u2019s Literature\u2019, has been from the certainties of didactic imperatives\nto an openness to dialogue, diversity, and models of agency. For the central\ncharacters in many of these fictions, such agency takes many forms \u2013 political,\nsexual or spiritual, or in the telling of stories and life-narratives; and, on the part\nof the audience, dialogue and participatory engagement, through acts of reading,\nremain in the foreground of many of the contributions here.\nIf our era is going to seek ways to privilege scholarly rigour (or \u2018scientific\u2019\nrigour, in European terminology) over \u2018Grand Theory\u2019, it will need \u2013 as our\ncontributors emphasise \u2013 to be self-conscious about its presuppositions when\ndealing with the social themes that pervade children\u2019s literature and with\nliterature from other countries and cultures. This, we think, may become\nincreasingly evident as IRCL continues to publish submissions from all corners of\nthe world. In what is our first Vietnamese contribution to the study of children\u2019s\nliterature, Tran Quynh Ngoc Bui demonstrates the cultural uniqueness of a\nfolktale form found in South-East Asia. Her study may serve to remind us,\nfurther, that \u2018Grand Theory\u2019 was European theory and grounded knowledge\nin a Eurocentric perspective. It might, therefore, make more sense to read\na Vietnamese \u2018innocent persecuted heroine\u2019 tale, for example, not through\na Eurocentric comparative lens which discovers in it another version of the\nCinderella story, but as a narrative shaped through historical time by Buddhist\nand Confucian ontologies of the world and existence.\nForty years on, research in children\u2019s literature has become international to\nan extent perhaps beyond even that imagined by IRSCL\u2019s founders in 1969. Its\nexpansion coincides with another paradigm shift which will require empirical\ndepth profoundly engaged with multiple forms of context: history, certainly;\nlinguistic structures, always; the changing forms and status of genres; acts of\ntranslation in the broadest sense; methods of reading; and the relationships\nbetween local cultures and global forms. We live in interesting times.\nJohn Stephens and Pamela Knights\nviii Editor ia l\nWORKS CITED\nByron, Tanya. \u2018We See Children as Pestilent\u2019.
