Cross-sectional and longitudinal stud-\nies have provided some evidence in support of associa-\ntions between nutrient intake or status and cognitive\ndecline, though the evidence is inconsistent [1]. By con-\ntrast, intervention studies with antioxidant vitamins [2-5]\nor B vitamins [6-8] given for 24 weeks or more in commu-\nnity-living older people have found no evidence for a ben-\neficial effect of supplements, though a recent study of\nsubjects with raised homocysteine levels found a signifi-\ncant benefit of folic acid supplementation for 3 years on\nglobal cognitive function and two of the five component\ncognitive domains [9]. Two randomised trials which used\nmultivitamins for 24 weeks or more also found no evi-\ndence of a beneficial effect [10,11] but a small trial of frail\nelderly people in residential care found a beneficial effect\nof multivitamin and multimineral supplementation in\ntwo of the five tests of cognitive function after six months\n[12]. Another trial of a multivitamin and multimineral\nsupplement in healthy elderly subjects reported beneficial\neffects after one year in six of seven tests [13], though\nthese findings have recently been retracted in the light of\nconcerns about the veracity of the data and possible con-\nflicting commercial interest [14].\nThe MAVIS (Mineral And Vitamin Intervention Study)\ntrial was a large randomised, double-blind, placebo-con-\ntrolled trial of multivitamin and multimineral supple-\nmentation designed to assess possible effects on infection\nin men and women aged 65 years or over, using a supple-\nment containing eleven vitamins and five minerals [15].\nIn the MAVIS trial we also collected information on cog-\nnitive function to assess the possible effects of multivita-\nmin and multimineral supplementation on cognition,\nwhich we present in this paper.\nMethods\nThe MAVIS trial design and recruitment has been\ndescribed in more detail elsewhere [15]. 910 men and\nwomen aged 65 years and over who had not taken vita-\nmin, mineral or fish oil supplements within three months\nof recruitment (one month for supplements of water-sol-\nuble vitamins other than vitamin B12) were recruited from\nsix primary care health centres in North-East Scotland\nbetween February and December 2002. 97% of partici-\npants in both supplemented and placebo groups were liv-\ning in the community at recruitment and all were\nconsidered by their family doctor to be suitable for the\nstudy. We did not exclude any participants on the basis of\nimpaired cognitive function, though those with dementia\nwere unlikely to volunteer or would have been excluded\nby their doctor. We did not collect information on the\neducational status of participants but this age group\nwould all have attended formal education for at least\nseven years.\nParticipants were randomly allocated to receive either a\nmineral and vitamin supplement or matching placebo for\n12 months, with minimisation on health centre, age, gen-\nder and place of residence (living in the community or in\ncare). 456 participants (239 men, 217 women) received\nthe active supplement and 454 participants (240 men,\n214 women) received the placebo. The supplement con-\ntained 800 \u03bcg vitamin A, 60 mg vitamin C, 5 \u03bcg vitamin\nD, 10 mg vitamin E, 1.4 mg thiamin, 1.6 mg riboflavin, 18\nmg niacin, 6 mg pantothenic acid, 2 mg pyridoxine, 1 \u03bcg\nvitamin B12, 200 \u03bcg folic acid, 14 mg iron, 150 \u03bcg iodine,\n0.75 mg copper, 15 mg zinc, and 1 mg manganese. The\nparticipants were asked to take one tablet daily for a 12-\nmonth period, with compliance checked by reported con-\nsumption at monthly intervals. The nutrient content of\nthe tablet was chosen to be similar to most other com-\nmonly used supplements purchased over-the-counter and\nthe dosage was according to the manufacturers' instruc-\ntions. A 10% random sample provided tablets for tablet\ncounting. Risk of iron, folate, vitamin C or vitamin D defi-\nciency at baseline was assessed using a simple 17 item\nnutrition risk questionnaire for assessing risk of micronu-\ntrient deficiency in older people [16].\nCognitive function was assessed in all participants by digit\nspan forward and verbal fluency tests carried out face-to-\nface at recruitment and over the telephone at the end of\nthe intervention period. The digit span forward test\nrequires the participant to repeat a sequence of random\ndigits pronounced at a rate of approximately one per sec-\nond, beginning with two sequences of two digits and con-\ntinuing with two sequences of increasing length up to a\nsequence of nine digits or to failures on both tests of a\nshorter sequence. One point is scored for every correct\nsequence repeated with a maximum score of 16 points\n[17]. The verbal fluency test requires the participant to\nname words beginning with each of three separate letters\nin an exactly-timed one-minute period. The three letters\nused (either P, R and W or C, F and L) were randomly allo-\ncated at the baseline assessment and the other three letters\nused at the one year assessment. The score is the total\nnumber of words named correctly, excluding proper\nnouns and words with the same start but different endings\n[18].\nAnalyses were conducted with adjustment for baseline\nvalues and the trial minimisation factors where appropri-\nate. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted for trial\ngroup comparisons. Statistical significance was basedPage 2 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2007, 6:10 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/6\/1\/10upon the 95% confidence interval. For the two pre-\nplanned trial sub-group analyses (those aged 75 years and\nover and those at increased risk of deficiency assessed by\nthe nutrition risk questionnaire) the 99% confidence\ninterval was used to give the correct width of the 95% con-\nfidence interval.\nThe study protocol was approved by Grampian Research\nEthics Committee and all participants gave written con-\nsent to take part.\nResults\nThe supplemented and placebo groups were well-\nmatched in terms of baseline characteristics (table 1). 290\nparticipants were aged 75 years or over and 260 partici-\npants were identified as being at increased nutritional risk\nat baseline. During the trial, 12 participants died, 77\nstopped taking their tablets and 44 were lost to follow up.\nCompliance with taking the tablets for all participants for\nthe whole 12-month period was over 78% in both supple-\nmented and placebo groups [15].\nThere were no significant differences in baseline test\nresults between the supplemented and placebo groups in\nall participants or in the two pre-planned sub-groups\n(table 2). Overall there was evidence of improvement in\ndigit span forward test scores from baseline to 12 months\n(mean change 0.4, 95% CI 0.2, 0.6) but not in the verbal\nfluency scores (mean change 0.8, 95% CI -0.2, 1.7). There\nwas no evidence for a difference in the overall change\nbetween the supplemented and placebo groups in either\ndigit span forward or verbal fluency tests. When separate\nanalyses were repeated for the two subgroups (those aged\n75 years or over and those at risk of nutritional deficiency)\nthere was also no evidence for a difference between sup-\nplemented and placebo groups in the digit span forward\ntest. However, in the verbal fluency tests in participants\naged 75 years or over there was weak evidence for a bene-\nficial effect (mean difference between supplemented and\nplacebo groups of 2.8 (95% CI -0.6, 6.2) units). A similar\ntrend was observed in the participants who were at\nincreased risk of nutritional deficiency (mean difference\nbetween supplemented and placebo groups of 2.5 (95%\nCI -1.0, 6.1) units).\nDiscussion\nOverall, our results provide no evidence for a beneficial\neffect of multivitamin and multimineral supplementation\non cognitive function in the majority of men and women\n65 years and over living in the community. This result is\nconsistent with all previous studies in non-selected elderly\npopulations [2-10] apart from the retracted Canadian\nstudy [13]. In the present study the doses of the vitamins\nand minerals in the supplement ranged from 50\u2013210% of\nthe UK reference nutrient intakea i.e. levels which could be\nachieved by a well-balanced diet. Several other studies\nhave used higher doses, particularly of B vitamins [2-4] or\nantioxidant vitamins [5-7] but none of these found a ben-\neficial effect. We considered the possibility that the partic-\nipants in the present study were unusually well nourished\nbut found no evidence to support this, as the proportion\nof participants aged 75 years and over classified as at\nincreased risk of micronutrient deficiency was similar to\nthose in an earlier cross-sectional survey in the area [19];\nin addition we excluded subjects who had been taking\ndietary supplements prior to the study who were more\nlikely to have had better dietary intake and nutritional sta-\ntus [20].\nThe cognitive function tests used in the present study\nassessed only short term memory and executive function,\nso we cannot rule out the possibility of effects in other\ncognitive domains such attention and concentration. We\nselected the two tests used in the present study as they\ncould be carried out by telephone at follow-up, but future\nstudies should include a wider range of tests of different\ncognitive domains. We also cannot exclude the possibility\nof effects of nutrients such as selenium or n-3 polyunsat-\nurated fatty acids, which were not included in the supple-\nments used.\nFor the subgroups defined on the basis of age or nutri-\ntional risk, there was weak evidence for a beneficial effect\nin verbal fluency but not in the digit span forward test.\nDigit span forward is a test of attention and immediate\nmemory involving a relatively familiar task which may be\nperformed relatively well even in advanced cognitive\ndecline, while verbal fluency tests speed of processing and\ninformation retrieval which are sensitive to the difficulty\nin generating words characteristic of Alzheimer's disease\n[21]. The possibility that those at increased risk of nutri-\ntional deficiency may benefit from supplements is sup-\nported by the FACIT study of men and women aged 50\u2013\n70 y with elevated homocysteine in whom there were sig-\nnificant effects on global cognitive function, though for\nspecific cognitive domains the effects were seen in mem-\nory (assessed by recall of 15 common words) and infor-\nmation processing speed (assessed by letter-digit\nsubstitution) but not in verbal fluency (assessed by asking\nthe subjects to name as many animals as possible in one\nminute) or in sensorimotor speed or complex speed [9].\nThe possibility of a beneficial effect in higher risk subjects\nis also supported by the study of Dutch care home resi-\ndents with a BMI less than 25 kg\/m2 and median age of 83\ny which found beneficial effects of multivitamins and\nmultiminerals in a test of short-term memory and one of\ntwo tests of category fluency [12]. The clinical significance\nof the differences in the verbal fluency test scores between\nsupplemented and placebo groups seen in the present\nstudy is difficult to estimate as the tests are not widelyPage 3 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition Journal 2007, 6:10 http:\/\/www.nutritionj.com\/content\/6\/1\/10used in clinical practice, but data from a cross-sectional\nstudy of Canadian adults suggest that the rate of decline in\nperformance on this test is of the order of one point per 3\nyears [22]. By this estimate the difference of 2 points\nobserved between the supplemented and placebo groups\nin the present study would be equivalent to the decline\nseen over 6 years of normal aging and could therefore rep-\nresent a clinically useful effect.\nA limitation of this study is that we classified participants\nas being at increased risk of nutritional deficiency using a\nsimple risk questionnaire rather than by measuring their\nactual nutritional status from blood samples. The nutri-\ntion assessment questionnaire used had previously been\nvalidated by comparison with blood measures of nutrient\nstatus in 398 community-living men and women aged 75\nand over, in whom the odds ratios (95% CI) for deficiency\nof iron, folate, vitamin C and vitamin D in those identi-\nfied at risk by the questionnaire were 3.8 (2.0, 6.9); 5.1\n(2.3; 11.3); 5.7 (3.1, 10.4) and 4.3 (1.9, 9.4) respectively\n[16]. Better definition of subjects at nutritional risk could\nbe useful in assessing whether the effect seen in those\nidentified as being at nutritional risk in this study is a real\neffect.\nIn summary, we found no evidence for a beneficial effect\nof multivitamin and multimineral supplementation on\ntwo tests of cognitive function in tests in the total sample\nof participants, but cannot exclude the possibility of ben-\neficial effects in those at higher risk of nutritional defi-\nciency.
