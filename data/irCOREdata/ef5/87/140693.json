To validate the functional ability of maternally\nderived IL-7 we cross fostered IL-7 knock-out mice onto normal wild type mothers. Subsets of thymocytes and populations\nof peripheral T cells were significantly higher than those found in knock-out mice receiving milk from IL-7 knock-out\nmothers.\nConclusions\/Significance: Our study provides direct evidence that interleukin 7, a factor which is critical in the\ndevelopment of T lymphocytes, when maternally derived can transfer across the intestine of the offspring, increase T cell\nproduction in the thymus and support the survival of T cells in the peripheral secondary lymphoid tissue.\nCitation: Aspinall R, Prentice AM, Ngom PT (2011) Interleukin 7 from Maternal Milk Crosses the Intestinal Barrier and Modulates T-Cell Development in\nOffspring.

Epidemiologic\nstudies in low income countries show that breast feeding\nsubstantially reduces the risk of infection, especially from enteric\ndisease [2,3] and that lactation represents an \u2018ingenious\nimmunological integration of the mother and the child\u2019 [2].\nBreast milk is also a vehicle for providing immunological\nsupport to the developing offspring with the well demonstrated\npresence of the products of both cellular and humoral immune\nresponses in breast milk following vaccination of the mother\n[4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11].\nThe reduction in the severity and frequency of disease in breast-\nfed infants indicates the impact of components of breast milk on\nimmunity in the offspring, but at issue is whether this protection\narises solely through factors in the milk supplementing the\ninadequate immune response of the offspring or whether\ncomponents within milk have a dichotomic effect both supple-\nmenting the response and enhancing the development of the\nimmune system, boosting the production and aiding the survival of\nlymphocytes, in the offspring.\nSupplementation of the immune response of the offspring is the\ncurrent paradigm for characterising the beneficial action of\nbreastfeeding with evidence presented for factors transmitted to\nthe offspring acting directly on the potential pathogen. For\nexample IgA antibodies specific for E. coli, H. influenzae, H. pylori\nand S. pneumoniae which have been found in human milk and which\nact in the intestinal lumen (or in the airways following inhalation of\nmilk droplets) of the offspring by binding antigen, so reducing the\ninfective nature of potential pathogens. In addition factors such as\nepidermal growth factor may help to induce more rapid\nmaturation of the intestinal epithelium leading to decreased\npermeability to pathogens [12].\nLess direct evidence is available to support the notion that\nbreast milk factors enhance the development of the immune\nsystem within the offspring. Whilst the link between inadequate\nnutrition and thymic atrophy has been known since at least 1810\n[13] it was only more recently shown that offspring fed on breast\nmilk possessed larger thymuses than those fed on formula feed\n[14,15] suggesting the presence of a component in breast milk\nwhich could augment thymic growth and development. Thymic\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20812\nsize is important, partly because in humans a small thymic size at 6\nmonths of age is associated with a higher risk of mortality [16] and\npartly because thymic size is also an indicator of thymic output\n[17]. A positive correlation between thymic size in the perinatal\nperiod and survival was also shown by a study in Guinea-Bissau\n[18] and later extended by work in rural Gambia [19].\nStudies in rural Gambia showed that children born in the\nhungry season have smaller thymuses eight weeks after birth\ncompared with their counterparts born in the harvest season\n[19,20]. Moreover the rates of mortality in young adulthood of\nthose born before the harvest were up to 10-fold higher than their\ncounterparts, with the available data suggesting many of the\ndeaths were infection-related [21,22]. One factor considered\nintegral to the concept of enhancing immune development was\ninterleukin-7 (IL-7) shown to be present at higher levels in the\nbreast milk of those born after the harvest in the rural Gambian\nstudy [19]. IL-7 has a central role in T cell development in the\nthymus and the maintenance of T cells in the peripheral T cell\npool [23]. Because of the association between the amount of\navailable IL-7 in the thymus and thymocyte numbers [24], the\npossibility that maternally-derived IL-7 was having an additive\neffect on thymic output in the offspring has been proposed [19].\nHowever this would require that the IL-7 survive digestion and be\ntransmitted from the mother to the tissues of the offspring through\nthe medium of the maternally derived milk.\nWe sought to test this possibility by feeding newborn mouse\npups recombinant IL-7, labelled with a fluorescent dye, and\ntracing its path within the animal. To supplement these studies we\nalso sought to determine the effect of cross fostering newborn\ntransgenic mouse pups carrying the IL-7 knock out gene onto wild\ntype dams to determine whether there was an effect of the murine\nmaternally derived IL-7.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nAll mice were housed in the animal house at Imperial College\nLondon and all experiments were carried out under approval by\nthe Home Office under Project License (PPL70\/5736). All efforts\nwere made to minimise pain and suffering. No human samples\nwere used in this study.\nMice\nWild type C57Bl\/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Olac and\nmaintained either in positive pressure isolators or individually\nventilated cages. For feeding experiments most mice were born at\nnight and so the day of their first appearance was considered to be\nday 1. IL-7 knock-out mice were obtained from the National\nInstitute of Medical Research with the permission of Prof. Paulo\nViera and maintained in positive pressure isolators. These mice were\noriginally generated from mutated ES cells injected into blastocysts\nfrom C57BL\/6 mice, where the resulting male chimeras were mated\nto C57BL\/6 females to test for germ-line transmission [25].\nAnalysis of IL-7 levels in milk\nSucking pups were culled by cervical dislocation, their stomachs\nremoved and the wall dissected away from the bolus of milk. The\npartially solidified milk was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline\novernight at 4uC and the IL-7 content was assayed by sandwich ELISA\nand quantified against recombinant murine IL-7 standards (R&D, UK).\nCell staining and analysis\nAnalysis of thymocyte subsets was performed as previously\ndescribed [26]. Briefly the thymus was removed and cell\nsuspensions made and approximately 16106 thymocytes were\nincubated with the following sets of anti-bodies; anti-CD4-R-PE\n(clone H129.19), anti-CD8-R-PE (clone 53-6.7), anti-CD3-R-PE\n(clone 17A2), anti-CD19-R-PE (clone ID3), anti-CD25-FITC\n(clone 7D4) and anti-CD44-Cy-chrome (clone IM7) or their\nappropriate isotype controls. Alternatively thymocytes were\nstained with anti-CD8-FITC (clone 53-6.7) and anti-CD4-Cy-\nChrome (clone H129.19) or their appropriate isotype controls.\nSpleens were removed and cell suspensions made and the total\nnumber of cells obtained counted. Cells were then stained with\nanti-CD8-FITC (clone 53-6.7) and anti-CD4-Cy-Chrome (clone\nH129.19) and anti-CD3-R-PE (clone 17A2) or their appropriate\nisotype controls. All antibodies were obtained from Becton\nDickinson.\nCells were stained with the antibody cocktails for approximately\n30 minutes at 4uC and then washed with phosphate buffered saline\n(PBS) and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were\nanalysed with a with a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD\nPharmingen) and data analysis was performed using WinMDI\nsoftware.\nIRDye 800 labelling of IL-7 and tracing in vivo\nCarrier-free recombinant mouse IL-7 (R&D) or carrier-free\nrecombinant mouse albumin (Gentaur, Brussels) were labelled\nwith IRDye800 (Li-cor biosciences) according to the manufactur-\ner\u2019s instructions a version of which can be found at http:\/\/\nbiosupport.licor.com\/support. Briefly, the protein dissolved in\nPBS and the reactive IRDye 800 dissolved in DMSO were mixed\nin the dark for approximately 2 hours and then dialysed against\nPBS. 100 ng of labelled proteins were delivered into the stomachs\nof newborn mice within 24 hours of birth by gavage and the mice\nwere immobilised by chilling [27] and scanned using a Li-cor\nOdyssey scanner.\nQuantitation of labelled protein in the tissues\nTissues were digested in 50 ml of a 1 in 5 dilution of proteinase k\n(Qiagen UK) in PBS overnight at 37uC. The solution was then\nplaced in the wells of a 96 well plate and scanned. The plate also\ncontained a dilution series in quadruplicate of labelled mouse IL-7.\nPrior analysis revealed that overnight incubation in the presence of\nproteinase K did not affect the level of fluorescence.\nFigure 1. IL-7 can be detected in the milk of mice in the\noffspring after birth but not for the entire period of weaning.\nThe IL-7 content of milk was assayed by sandwich ELISA and quantified\nagainst recombinant murine IL-7 standards.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0020812.g001\nMaternal IL-7 and the Immune System of the Progeny\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20812\nCross fostering experiments\nBreeding programs were set up with both the IL-7 knock out\nand C57\/Bl6 wild type animals. Litters were transferred to their\nfoster dams within 24 hours of birth. Animals were taken at\nweaning (approximately 20 days after birth) culled by CO2\nasphyxiation and their tissues removed.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using an unpaired T test\nwhere significance was considered when p,0.05.\nResults\nIL-7 in mouse milk\nWe demonstrated the presence of IL-7 in mouse milk, by\nassaying milk obtained from the stomachs of suckling mice at\nseveral time points in the post natal period. Two days after birth,\nmouse pups had IL-7 present at an average of 146 pg per animal\nand this fell to an average of 76pg per animal 4 days after birth\nFigure 2. Diagrammatic representation of an outline of the\nexperimental procedure to follow labelled IL-7 from the gut to\nthe lymphoid organs.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0020812.g002\nFigure 3. IRDye800 labelled IL-7 introduced by gavage into the stomach of a mouse pup can be detected as green fluorescence in\nthe anterior mediastinum on the next day (A), as indicated by the white arrow. Labelled product is apparent also around the jaws of the\nanimal and in the intestine. The pup is in a prone position on the glass surface of the Odyssey and the image is from underneath. Two examples of\nsamples from quantitation studies are shown here where newborn pups were fed 100 ng of labelled protein, either rIL-7 (B,C) or albumin (D,E), and\nculled after 24 hours and their thymus (B,D) and spleen (C,E) removed and scanned.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0020812.g003\nMaternal IL-7 and the Immune System of the Progeny\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20812\nand was below the level of detection 8 days after birth (Fig 1). We\ntested animals at both 14 and 18 days after birth but failed to\ndetect IL-7 in the milk in their stomachs at these times. We\nvalidated the specificity of our assay by testing milk from IL-7\nknock-out mice and found it to be negative and were further\nconcerned that the lL-7 we detected in milk was absorbed from the\nplasma. This seemed unlikely because we could detect IL-7 in the\nblood of these animals at weaning at an average of 13.6 ng\/ml of\nserum but were unable to detect any in the stomach at day 8 and\nthereafter.\nTracing IL-7 movement from the gut\nWhether the movement of IL-7 across the gut into the tissues\nwas feasible was tested by introducing recombinant murine IL-7\nlabelled with IRDye800 into the stomach of newborn mice and\ntracing its movement as outlined (Fig 2). We following labelled IL-\n7 in live mouse pups over time by imaging and our initial results\nsuggested that labelled IL-7 could traverse the gut and be\nidentified in the anterior mediastinum in a region where we\nwould expect to find the thymus (Fig 3A).\nWe were concerned that the fluorescence we were detecting in\nthe anterior mediastinum may have derived from label detaching\nfrom the IL-7 and to test for this we fed mice either recombinant\nmouse albumin labelled with IRDye 800 or recombinant mouse\nIL-7 labelled with the same dye and imaged them over the same\ntime period. When we viewed their fluorescence our results\nrevealed that organs from animals fed labelled IL-7 were far\nbrighter than those fed labelled albumin (Fig 3B-E) suggesting that\nthe IRDye800 remained associated with the IL-7 after its passage\nthrough the gut. To assess the percentage of IL-7 which travelled\nfrom the gut to the lymphoid organs we fed 1 day old pups 100 ng\nof labelled IL-7 and 24 hours later excised the thymus and the\nspleens of these animals. To assess the amount of labelled protein\npresent in these tissues we digested the spleen and thymus from the\noffspring with proteinase K and measured the fluorescence of the\nsolution, and compared it with our labelled IL-7 standard curve\n(Fig 4a, b). From this we calculated that the thymus contained on\naverage 65pg (n= 11) whilst the spleen contained an average of\n62pg (n= 12) of labelled IL-7 (Fig 4c).\nCross fostering experiments\nTransmission across the gut does not necessarily imply that the\nmaternally-derived IL-7 would be functionally active in the\nlymphoid tissue, so we sought to determine the contribution of\nIL-7 in murine milk to T cell production and maintenance in the\noffspring by analysing IL-7 knock out pups fostered onto wild type\ndams (KORWT) and comparing them with IL-7 knock outs on\nIL-7 knock out dams (KORKO), wild type on IL-7 knock outs\ndams (WTRKO) and wild type on wild type dams (WTRWT).\nAnalysis of the subpopulations within the thymus (Table 1) showed\nsimilar numbers of triple negative cells in KORWT, WTRKO\nand WTRWT pups and these values were almost 3 times higher\nthan found in KORKO pups. Comparison of later stages in the\npathway showed a similar number of double positive and single\npositive thymocytes in the KORKO and KORWT pups and\nthat these values were considerably less than in the WTRKO and\nWTRWT pups.\nFurther analysis was undertaken within the triple negative\npopulation to determine any differences and the results revealed\nthat there were more CD44+CD252 cells in the KORWT pups\n(average of 5.056105) compared with the KORKO pups (average\nof 1.56105), and the progeny of this population, the CD44+CD25+\ncells showed significantly greater numbers in KORWT animals\ncompared with the KORKO pups (1.156105 versus 8.136104\np= 0.03 Fig 5).\nTo determine the effect of maternal IL-7 on peripheral T cell\npopulations we followed changes in the T cells in the spleens of our\nKORWT and compared them with their KORKO and wild\ntype (WT) counterparts. The results reveal a significantly greater\npercentage of CD3+ T cells in the spleens of KORWT than in the\nKORKO pups and this translated into significantly greater T cell\nFigure 4.

The standard curve of recombinant CW800\nlabelled murine IL-7 (B) shows means6 1 standard deviation from\nquadruplicate wells and the calculated amount of IL-7 in individual\nspleens and thymuses, are seen in (C).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0020812.g004\nMaternal IL-7 and the Immune System of the Progeny\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e20812\nnumbers (Table 2). Closer analysis of the subpopulations revealed\n(Fig 6) that the KORWT pups contained significantly more\nCD3+CD4+ T cells than the KORKO spleens (6.86105 vs\n3.56105 p= 0.026).\nDiscussion\nThese results demonstrate that IL-7 is present in milk and\nprovide direct evidence that when transmitted to the offspring IL-7\ncan cross the gut and enter the tissues and impact on both T cell\nproduction and T cell maintenance.\nThe detection of IL-7 in mouse milk mirrors previous human\nstudies [28,19] and the detection profile of IL-7 within the milk,\nhigh after birth and then declining with time is similar to that\nseen in our earlier human studies in The Gambia [19], and to\nthat reported for IL-18 [29]. The identification of IL-7 in\nmaternally derived milk posed the question of whether it could\nbe transported into the tissues to act systemically. Maturation of\nthe gastrointestinal tract is a dynamic process and at birth the\nbarrier function is still developing. The permeability of the gut\nto macromolecules is a recognised phenomenon with evidence\nfrom previous studies showing that intact large peptides present\nin milk such as insulin or epidermal growth factor can cross the\nintestinal barrier and enter the circulation of the offspring\n[30,31].\nOur initial profiles of the fluorescence distribution after feeding\ntagged IL-7 suggest that the IL-7 could pass through the gut and\nenter the tissues however these profiles could also be interpreted\nas being due to the dissociation of the fluorescent tag from the IL-\n7 molecule following acid or protease digestion. Secretion of acid\nis initiated 4 days after birth in the mouse [32] whilst\nenteropeptidases such as enterokinase are present on postnatal\ndays 2\u20136 albeit at low levels [33]. The neonates were fed labelled\nIL-7 on the day after birth and so it seemed unlikely that\ndigestion or dissociation of the protein could be construed to\naccount for the fluorescence seen in the tissues. Moreover the\nconsiderably reduced fluorescence seen when animals were fed\nlabelled recombinant murine albumin would also seem to support\nthis and discount the notion that the fluorescent profile we saw\nwas due to digestion of the protein and release of the fluorescent\ntag.\nThe data from fluorescent analysis provides direct support for\nthe movement of IL-7 into the tissues, and further confirmation\nthat IL-7 could cross the gut and be functionally active in the\ntissues came from analysis of lymphoid tissue in IL-7 knock out\npups fostered onto wild type dams at birth.\nTable 1.

In the thymus of\nnormal wild type animals the earliest precursors of the T cell\npathway are CD32CD4l|oCD8 [34] and differentiation stages\nfrom these precursors can be discriminated on the basis of\nexpression of CD44 and CD25. Progress from the most immature\nstage, CD44+CD252 requires the transient acquisition of CD25 so\nthe cell first becomes CD44+CD25+ before becoming\nCD442CD25+ and then the loss of CD44 when the population\nis CD442CD252 [35]. IL-7 has a crucial role in these early\ndevelopmental stages where it aids the survival of cells [36] and all\nsubsets express the IL-7 receptor but at different levels. Because\nearly stages in the intrathymic pathway show slightly higher levels\nof expression of the IL-7 receptor than the later CD442 stages\n[37] their enhanced survival may be favoured when IL-7 is limited\nand this is reflected in the differences seen between the KO pups\non KO dams and those on WT dams. The increase in the number\nof cells in the populations of these early stages of the T cell\npathway seen in the KO pups on WT dams compared with KO\npups on KO dams was noticeable and we considered sample bias\nto be an unlikely contributor to this because for each condition we\nanalysed the results of several transfers.\nAnalysis of the T cells in the spleen was undertaken to confirm\nwhether there were any downstream effects on T cell develop-\nment. The significant increase in the number of T cells within the\nCD4+ subset in the KO pups on WT dams compared with KO\npups on KO dams fits with previous work showing that the naive\nCD4+ T cell population is the compartment easily perturbed by\nabrogating IL-7\u2013IL-7R interactions, which may be because this\npopulation expresses a slightly higher level of IL-7R on the cell\nsurface than other peripheral T cell populations [38]. Our results\nalso fit with a previous study which noted that during the early\npostnatal period recent thymic emigrants emerge into a lympho-\npenic environment and undergo antigen independent proliferation\nwhich is mainly restricted to CD4+ T cells [39].\nThe results from both the tracing experiments and the cross\nfostering experiments together provide direct evidence that\nmaternally derived IL-7 impacts on the immune system in the\noffspring. Breast feeding has been known to have a positive effect\non thymic size [40,15,41] in the offspring and our study indicates\nthat IL-7 in maternal milk contributes to this increased size. Both\nthymic output and peripheral proliferation contribute to the\nformation of the peripheral T cell pool [42,43] and since\nproliferation expands only pre-existing peripheral T cells, greater\nthymic output would indicate a broader repertoire in the\nperipheral T cell pool. In addition to its effect on thymic size,\nprovision of IL-7 from maternal sources would assist the\nproliferation of peripheral T cells. In adults the amount of\navailable IL-7 in the periphery has been considered to regulate the\nsize of the peripheral T cell pool, where its production by stromal\ncells in lymphoid organs appears to be uninfluenced by extrinsic\nstimuli [44]. The presence of maternally derived IL-7 will disturb\nthe equilibrium between overall T cell numbers and the fixed rate\nof endogenous IL-7 production, introducing a bias towards the\nFigure 6.
