INTRODUCTION\nThe mass 130\u2013140 region of nuclei, near the proton drip\nline, is currently the subject of a considerable amount of\ntheoretical attention. This activity has been directed toward\nthe understanding of proton radioactivity @1# that was re-\ncently observed in 140Ho, 141Ho, and 131Eu @2,3#. In these\nnuclei, the proton decay rates are explained in terms of a\nsingle proton tunneling through a Coulomb plus centrifugal\nbarrier using the WKB approximation and spectroscopic fac-\ntors derived from low-seniority deformed shell-model calcu-\nlations @2\u20135#. In contrast, the proton decay rates in the\nheavier nuclei from Z569 (Tm) to Z581 (Tl) have been\ndescribed by calculations based on spherical shell-model cal-\nculations @6#.

The mass 130\u2013140 drip-line nuclei have, how-\never, proven to be very difficult to access and study at mod-\nerate spins using heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reactions\nwith stable beam and target combinations. In this region,\nevaporation residues that are less neutron deficient are un-\navoidably produced with larger cross sections than the other\nnuclei of interest. The reason that 140Ho, 141Ho, and 131Eu\ncould be studied @1,33# relies on the fact that these channels\ncan be selectively tagged by the observation of a proton de-\ncay with a specific energy. For the other nuclei in this region\nthat do not proton decay, this method cannot be exploited\nand therefore, a systematic study of the evolution of nuclear\ndeformation with mass, cannot be undertaken using proton\ntagging alone.\nIn order to complement the information obtained from\nproton-decay measurements and extend the experimental\nknowledge of this proton-rich region, another tagging\nmethod is required to preferentially select the nuclei of inter-\nest. The tagging method employed in this work requires the\npresence of an isomeric state that decays by g-ray emission.\nIsomeric states are not uncommon in this region and indeed\nproton emission was recently observed from an isomeric\nstate in 141mHo @3#. Such isomers are a result of the high-j\nstates that involve the h11\/2 intruding proton orbit and their\nassociated high-multipolarity decays. In addition, the h11\/2\nproton orbits tend to favor collective prolate deformed\u00a92001 The American Physical Society21-1\nC. SCHOLEY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 63 034321shapes with g50\u00b0; and the neutron configurations, being in\nthe upper part of the h11\/2 shell, tend to favor collective ob-\nlate nuclear shapes with g5260\u00b0. Both of the associated\nprolate and oblate potential-energy minima are predicted to\nhave similar energies @7\u20139#. Recoil isomer tagging was re-\ncently employed to correlate prompt and delayed data across\na 6-ms, Kp582 isomer in 138Gd @10# and establish the\nprompt rotational band built upon the isomer. The selective\npower of recoil isomer tagging, like that of proton tagging,\ncan be demonstrated by the fact that even when the energies\nof the prompt \u2018\u2018above-isomer\u2019\u2019 transitions are known it re-\nmains almost impossible to isolate these transitions in the\nprompt g-g coincidence data due to the overwhelming num-\nber of competing channels with large cross sections. How-\never, now that the first few g rays have been established by\nrecoil isomer tagging, high-fold coincidence data from the\nEUROBALL @11# or GAMMASPHERE @12# large arrays of\nhigh-efficiency detectors should provide this selection. This\npaper reports on the establishment of new states above a\nknown 15-ms isomer in 142Tb @13# and the feeding and decay\nof a new isomeric state in 144Ho. This measurement repre-\nsents first observation of excited states in 144Ho. The diffi-\nculty in studying these nuclei can be put into perspective\nby considering that 144Ho and 142Tb are 21 and 17 neutrons\naway from their respective stable isotopes, 165Ho and 159Tb.\nIt is anticipated that isomer tagging can be selectively\napplied to many other isomeric nuclei in this region. In\nthis way, it will be possible to bridge the gap in knowledge\nbetween those nuclei that can be studied, at the proton drip-\nline using proton-decay tagging, and the less neutron-\ndeficient nuclei that have sufficiently large cross sections\nsuch that they can be studied in heavy-ion fusion-\nevaporation reactions without the requirement of additional\nchannel selection.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nModerate-spin states in the very neutron-deficient nuclei,\n142Tb and 144Ho, were populated with the 54Fe192Mo reac-\ntion. Two stacked 92Mo foils, of thickness 500\n1300 mg\/cm2, were bombarded with 54Fe beams at ener-\ngies of 236 and 226 MeV from the K130 cyclotron at the\nUniversity of Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8, Finland. Prompt g-ray transitions\nwere detected with the 27 escape-suppressed germanium de-\ntectors of the JUROSPHERE II spectrometer that consisted\nof 15 EUROGAM type I detectors @14# @of efficiency \u201970%\nrelative to a standard 76376 mm NaI~Tl! detector at\n1.3 MeV#, seven TESSA type detectors @15#, and five\nNORDBALL type detectors @16# ~both of relative\nefficiency \u201925%). The absolute photo-peak efficiency of\nthe JUROSPHERE II array was measured to be \u20191.5% at\n1.3 MeV. The recoiling evaporation residues were separated\nfrom the beamlike particles by the RITU gas-filled separator\n@17#. The flight time of the recoils through RITU was ap-\nproximately 0.5 ms. At the focal plane of RITU the residues\npassed through a multiwire proportional counter ~MWPC!\nand implanted into a 16-strip 80335 mm silicon detector\n@18#. The Si-strip detector covered approximately 70% of the\nrecoil distribution at the focal plane. Three NORDBALL and03432two TESSA detectors were placed in a close geometry\naround the Si-strip detector in order to detect isomeric or\ndelayed g rays that were emitted within \u201950 ms of a recoil\narriving at the focal plane. The absolute focal-plane effi-\nciency of these detectors was determined to be \u20190.9% at 1.3\nMeV.\nThe data acquisition was triggered for 50 ms by a recoil\nevent in the Si detector. During this 50-ms period, delayed g\nrays that were detected at the focal plane, events in the\nMWPC detector, and previously detected prompt g rays\nfrom JUROSPHERE II were written to tape. The beam cur-\nrent was approximately 2.7 particle-nA at the higher beam\nenergy ~236 MeV! and 2.4 particle-nA at the lower beam\nenergy ~226 MeV!. These beam currents produced a prompt\ng-ray rate in JUROSPHERE II of 1.3 kHz, and a Si rate of\n3.0 kHz at 236 MeV, and 1.0 kHz and 2.0 kHz, at 226 MeV,\nrespectively. In the experiment, a total of 63106 prompt\nevents were correlated with delayed events in approximately\nfive days of beam time at 236 MeV and 43105 prompt\nevents in approximately one day at 226 MeV. Energy and\nefficiency measurements were performed with calibrated\n133Ba, 152Eu, and 60Co radioactive sources placed both at\nthe JUROSPHERE II target position and at the Si detector\nposition for the focal-plane germanium detectors.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nThe analysis was performed using a series of two-\ndimensional matrices and the UPAK @19# software package. In\nparticular, at each beam energy, a recoil-gated g-g matrix\nwas created, which contained only those prompt events that\nwere detected in JUROSPHERE II in coincidence with a\nrecoiling nucleus in the Si detector. The main channels popu-\nlated at 236 MeV were measured to be 26% 144Dy ~from the\n2p evaporation channel!, 54% 143Tb (3p), 11% 142Gd\n(4p), 8% 140Gd (a2p), and 3% 141Tb (ap). Similarly at\n226 MeV, the main channels populated were 47% 144Dy\n(2p), 44% 143Tb (3p), 3% 142Gd (4p), 4% 140Gd (a2p),\nand 3% 141Tb (ap).\nThese data were also sorted into a series of prompt (g ray\ndetected in JUROSPHERE II! versus delayed (g ray de-\ntected at focal plane! coincidence matrices with various con-\nstraints on the time of the delayed g ray, after a recoiling\nnucleus was implanted into the Si detector. These matrices\nallowed correlation of prompt and delayed data across iso-\nmeric states. In order to extract lifetimes for the isomeric\nstates, a matrix was constructed of delayed g-ray energy\nagainst the time that the delayed g ray as measured by the\ndelayed-g versus recoil time to amplitude converter ~TAC!.\nThis TAC was started by a recoil event in the Si detector and\nstopped by a delayed g ray detected in the focal-plane ger-\nmanium detectors. In the analysis, many new delayed transi-\ntions were observed with half-lives in the nano to microsec-\nond (ns2ms) range. The most strongly selected transitions\nin this work were assigned to the decay of the known 15-ms\nisomer in 142Tb @13# and a new isomeric state in 144Ho.1-2\nRECOIL ISOMER TAGGING IN THE PROTON-RICH . . .

The inset shows the\nx-ray region expanded for clarity.A. 142Tb\nThe main g rays that dominate the delayed spectra, in the\nlifetime range from 10\u201330 ms at the higher beam energy\n236 MeV, were the 37-, 137-, 165-, 219-, and 303-keV tran-\nsitions, which are known decays from the 15-ms isomer in\n142Tb @13,9#. 142Tb was produced through the 3pn exit chan-\nnel and was strongly observed at the higher beam energy that\nwas optimized to the three-particle exit channels. A similarly\ngated spectrum from the lower beam energy data ~226 MeV!\nshowed little evidence for these transitions.\nBy correlating prompt and delayed g rays across the iso-\nmeric state @10#, the structure that feeds the isomer was ob-\nserved. Gates set on the 137-, 165-, and 303-keV transitions\non the delayed axis of the prompt-delayed matrix produced a\nspectrum of new prompt g rays that lie above the isomer,\nshown in Fig. 1~a!. Conversely, Fig. 1~b! shows the result of\ngating on some of these new transitions ~367-, 439-, 538-,\nand 557-keV! on the prompt axis of the matrix and project-\ning out the g rays that are in delayed coincidence. The inset\nto Fig. 1~b! shows the low-energy region of the spectrum that\nhas been expanded for clarity. It should be noted that the\ngood low-energy efficiency and resolution of the smaller-\nvolume TESSA and NORDBALL focal-plane detectors al-\nlow the Ka and Kb x rays to be detected. ~The Tb x-ray\nenergies are Ka1,2543.7 and 44.5 keV, and Kb1,2550.3 and\n51.7 keV.! These x-ray transitions are reduced in intensity in\nthe prompt spectra that were taken at the target position due\nto the presence of absorbers on the large-volume\nEUROGAM detectors. The detection of x rays is a useful\nproperty when the delayed radiation is from an unknown\nnuclide. Table I lists the measured g-ray energies and inten-\nsities for the known delayed transitions in 142Tb @13# and the\nnewly assigned prompt transitions above the 15-ms isomer.\nNote that once the prompt transitions have been estab-\nlished above the isomer, it might be expected that the level\nscheme can easily be constructed by solely using the prompt03432g-g matrix to examine the coincidences. In fact this is not\nthe case as setting these gates in the prompt matrix results in\na highly contaminated spectrum. Unfortunately, the 27 detec-\ntors of the JUROSPHERE II spectrometer did not yield suf-\nficient statistics to examine threefold coincidences for these\nweakly populated channels. This point illustrates the selec-\ntivity of the recoil isomer tagging technique for isolating\nisomeric states in channels with low production cross sec-\nTABLE I. g-ray energies for the known delayed transitions in\n142Tb @13# and g-ray energies and intensities for the new prompt\ntransitions above the isomer established in this work.

SCHOLEY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 63 034321tions. In order to proceed further, it was necessary to con-\nsider the intensities given in Table I and also to construct\nanother gated coincidence matrix of those prompt recoil-\ngated g-ray events that were gated by delayed 37-, 137-,\n165-, 219-, and 303-keV 142Tb transitions in the lifetime\nrange of 10\u201320 ms. Although the statistics in this matrix\nwere small, it was still possible to verify that the 557-, 760-,\nand 877-keV transitions are in coincidence with each other\nand therefore, likely form a rotational sequence. The other\nprompt g rays in Fig. 1~a!, 367-, 439-, and 538-keV are\ntentatively placed as decays into this sequence, see the level\nscheme for 142Tb, Fig. 2. The tentative placing of these tran-\nsitions is based upon their intensities, the fact that the energy\nsums for the 189.6- and 439.0-keV transitions are consistent\nwith the energy of the 628.6-keV transition, and the 439-keV\ntransition was determined to be in coincidence with the 557-\nkeV transition in a recoil-gated prompt g-g matrix. This\nlevel scheme for 142Tb is consistent with the discussion pre-\nsented in Sec. IV. The decay of the 15-ms isomer, which was\nfirst reported in Ref. @13#, was confirmed in this work from\nFIG. 2. The deduced level scheme for the states that feed the\nisomeric state in 142Tb. The white part of the transition arrows\nindicates the electron-conversion component. The decay of the 0.3 s\n(52) state is from Ref. @9#. The decay of the 15 ms is from Ref.\n@13#.03432the g-g coincidences recorded by the focal-plane detectors.\nThe decay of the 0.3-s (52) isomeric state was presented in\nRef. @9#.\nB. 144Ho\nFigure 3 shows a delayed spectrum measured at the focal\nplane of RITU produced from the data at both beam energies\nwith the only condition that any g ray must have occurred\n1 \u20133 ms after a recoil was implanted in the Si detector. The\nmain transitions in the spectrum are the 56-, 60-, 148-, and\n209-keV g rays and the 47- and 54-keV x rays. These g rays\nwere more strongly populated in the 226-MeV data than the\n236-MeV data, which implies that they likely arise from a\ntwo-particle rather than a three-particle exit channel. The de-\nlayed g-g matrix from the focal-plane detectors was used to\ndetermine the coincidence relations and relative intensities\nfor these transitions but the specific g-ray ordering remains\nambiguous with the present data. The multipolarities of the\ntransitions that depopulate the isomeric state have been de-\nduced from the intensity balance and the internal conversion\ncoefficients. A consistent solution for the decay of the isomer\nis only found if the 56-, 60-, and 148-keV transitions are of\nelectric dipole character and the 209-keV transition is of\nelectric quadrupole character.

Figure 6 shows the sum\nof the 502-, 724-, and 856-keV gated spectra from this ma-\ntrix. It was not possible to definitely establish whether the\n913-keV transition was also in coincidence with this 502-,\n724-, 856-, 885-, and 813-keV transition sequence in these\ndata, but this is likely. In addition, several other prompt g\nrays ~363-, 430-, and 468-keV! were observed to be in\nprompt coincidence with the delayed g rays in 144Ho.

IV.\nBased on the total number of prompt counts in the\nprompt-delayed spectra for 144Ho @Fig. 4~a!# and 142Tb @Fig.\n1~a!#, the production cross sections for these bands were es-\ntimated to be \u201916 mb and \u20198 mb, respectively.

DISCUSSION\nThe mass 130\u2013140 region of nuclei is well known for\nexhibiting nuclear shapes that become rather g soft or tri-\naxial as the neutron number approaches the less deformed\nregion around the N582 shell closure. This loss of axial\nsymmetry makes it difficult to assign specific configurations\nto particular states as the single-particle nuclear orbits be-\ncome severely mixed. The underlying reasons for this behav-\nior trend are related to the fact that the protons are in the\nlower part of the h11\/2 shell, where prolate deformed shapes\nare preferred, and the neutrons are in the upper part of the\nh11\/2 shell where oblate shapes are preferred. For example,\npredictions for the holmium nuclei, based on the03432macroscopic-microscopic mass model of Mo\u00a8ller et al. @22#\nand the recent calculations of Rykaczewski et al. @3# suggest\nthat 143Ho and 141Ho have a large quadrupole deformation,\nb2\u20190.29, 145Ho is only weakly deformed, and 147Ho has a\nspherical equilibrium shape @3#, with a sharp change in\nnuclear shape from prolate to oblate at 144Ho. Similarly, for\nthe terbium isotopes, the lighter isotopes 1402141Tb are pre-\ndicted to have a prolate deformation with a sharp change to\noblate deformation at 142Tb. According to Mo\u00a8ller et al. @22#\nFIG. 7. The level scheme deduced from these data for the states\nthat feed and depopulate the new 500(20)-ns isomeric state in\n144Ho.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 63 034321the two nuclei studied in this work, 142Tb and 144Ho, are the\nlightest isotopes in each case to show oblate nature and form\nthe N577 boundary between prolate shapes for the lighter\nisotopes and oblate shapes for the heavier isotopes. How-\never, it should be noted that these calculations do not allow\nfor nonaxial shapes.\nIn the present work, theoretical total Routhian surface\n~TRS! and Woods-Saxon cranked-shell-model ~CSM! calcu-\nlations @23# have been performed. The CSM calculations\nwere performed at a deformation extracted from the TRS\ncalculations (b250.192, b4520.022, and g5230\u00b0) and\nrepresent a triaxial nuclear shape. Figures 8 and 9 show the\nresults of this calculation for the protons and neutrons, re-\nspectively. This large triaxiality is a consequence of the com-\npetition between the different shape-driving effects of the\nprotons and neutrons and is a well-established feature for\nFIG. 8.

The large g deforma-\ntion is responsible for the large signature splitting of the\nsingle-particle orbits and can be observed in Figs. 8 and 9 for\nthe h11\/2 protons and the h11\/2 and f 7\/2 neutrons, respectively.\nA consequence of this large signature splitting is that rota-\ntional bands built upon these orbits are expected to form\ndecoupled (DI52) bands with one signature of the configu-\nration being more favored than the other. Under these triaxial\nconditions, the individual Nilsson quantum numbers are not\nconserved, for example, the neutron h11\/2 orbit will contain\nsubstantial components from the f 7\/2 orbit, etc. As a conse-\nquence, in the following discussion the configurations will be\nlabeled by the standard convention for parity (p) and signa-\nture (a), where E and F refer to (p ,a)5(2 ,21\/2)1 and\n(2 ,11\/2)1, respectively. The labels G and H refer to\n(p ,a)5(2 ,21\/2)2 and (2 ,11\/2)2, respectively, and the\npositive parity labels A and B refer to the (p ,a)5(1 ,\n11\/2)1 and (1 ,21\/2)1 orbits, respectively.\nThe low statistics for these recoil isomer tagged data do\nnot permit unambiguous spins and configurations to be as-\nsigned for the bands established in this work. For example, it\nwould have been useful to consider angular correlation ratios\nto assign transition multipolarities and therefore, spins to the\nstates. Such information may be obtainable from the large\nmultidetector arrays now that the first few transitions have\nbeen established in this work. However, in order to under-\nstand the underlying configurations of the isomeric states in\n144Ho and 142Tb, it is instructive to consider the properties\nof the states above the isomers which from these data appear\nto form collective rotational bands whose nature is domi-\nnated by the presence of the proton-h11\/2 orbits. To test these\nideas, the rotational bands built upon the isomeric states in\n144Ho and 142Tb have been systematically compared with\nother h11\/2 rotational bands in the neighboring nuclei. ~The\nsystematics of the N578 odd-proton nuclei 137Pm, 139Pm,\nand 141Eu were recently discussed in Ref. @24#.!\nFigure 10 shows the aligned angular momentum ~or align-\nment!, ix @26# versus rotational frequency for the above-\nisomer rotational bands in 144Ho ~consisting of the 502-,\n724-, 856-, 885-, and 813-keV transitions! and 142Tb ~con-\nsisting of the 557-, 760-, and 876-keV transitions! from this\nwork with that of the neighboring odd-mass h11\/2 bands in\n145Ho @27#, 143Tb @24#, 139Eu @28#, and 141Eu @29#. The\nbands in 144Ho and 142Tb have both been plotted with an\nisomer band-head spin of 7\\ and a K55\\ . These values are\nassumed to be the most likely spins based on the available\norbits around the Fermi surface shown in Figs. 8 and 9 and\nalso the likely multipolarities for the delayed transitions\nbased on intensity arguments. @Notice the similarity of the\ndecay schemes for 144Ho and 142Tb above the (52) state in\n142Tb.# In Fig. 10, the 143Tb band @24# is observed to gain\nalignment at 0.38 MeV and again at 0.44 MeV. The align-\nment gain Dix54\\ at 0.38 MeV was interpreted as the first\nallowed proton-band crossing ~the so-called FG proton\ncrossing! involving the second and third protons since the\nconfiguration of this band is based on the first proton ph11\/2\nE orbital being occupied @24#. Other bands whose configura-1-7\nC. SCHOLEY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 63 034321tions are based on this ph11\/2 proton E orbit are shown for\n145Ho, 139Eu, and 141Eu. These bands show similar align-\nment gains at 0.37 MeV although the europium isotopes ex-\nhibit a weaker mixing strength. Figure 10 shows that the\nbehavior of the band built upon the isomeric state in 144Ho is\nsimilar ~albeit with a slightly higher crossing frequency that\nis likely related to the different deformation!. The higher\ncrossing, at 0.44 MeV, was interpreted as the first allowed\nneutron crossing n(EF) in 143Tb @24#. Unfortunately, in the\npresent data set for 144Ho there were not sufficient statistics\nto verify the g-ray coincidences and ordering of the transi-\ntions above the 813-keV g ray and therefore, the total align-\nment gain could not be established. In a similar manner, the\nvalues for 142Tb appear to lie along the same locus as the\npoints for the other bands based on the first h11\/2 proton orbit.\nThe coincidence relationships for the 142Tb band do not al-\nlow this band to be extended into the band-crossing region.\nHowever, they appear to show the start of a slight upturn\nbetween 0.3 and 0.4 MeV. Due to these similarities, these\nnew bands above the isomers in 142Tb and 144Ho are rea-\nsoned to have the same underlying ph11\/2 proton E configu-\nration as their neighboring nuclei coupled to the lowest neu-\ntron configuration nE or nA , i.e., ph11\/2^ n(h11\/2 , f 7\/2) or\nph11\/2^ n(s1\/2 ,d3\/2) configurations.\nStrongly coupled bands, based on the ph11\/2^ nh11\/2 con-\nfiguration, were recently observed in 140Tb @31#. The differ-\nences between these bands in 140Tb and the bands in 142Tb\nand 144Ho are consistent with those expected for the larger\ntriaxiality and smaller deformation in the heavier nuclei @22#.\nThis triaxial interpretation is also consistent with the system-\natic trend observed for other N577 ph11\/2^ nh11\/2 bands\nwhere a sharp change in behavior is predicted @22# for the\nheavier isotones 142Tb and 144Ho.

In the figure, the bands in 142Tb and 144Ho show a\nlarger signature splitting than those in 136Pr @32# and 138Pm\n@33#. Notice that the alignment for the strongly coupled\nbands in 136Pr and 138Pm have adjacent points midway be-\ntween each other compared with the decoupled, presumably\nmore triaxial, bands in the heavier nuclei 142Tb and 144Ho\nthat show a shift from the midpoint. A decoupled h11\/2\nground-state band was also recently observed in 141Ho @34#\nwith a large signature splitting.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nTwo new bands built upon the isomeric states in 144Ho\nand 142Tb show a behavior that is consistent with that ex-\npected from deformed nuclei with a large triaxiality. Their\nunderlying single-particle configurations are likely composed\nof ph11\/2^ n(h11\/2 , f 7\/2) or ph11\/2^ n(s1\/2 ,d3\/2) states. In or-\nder to fully determine the underlying configuration, the ob-\nservation of the full-band crossings, which was not possible\nwith the current experimental setup, would be required. Now\nthat the low-spin transitions have been identified by a recoil\nisomer tagging technique, an experiment with one of the cur-\nrent state-of-the-art large multidetector arrays, such as\nEUROBALL @11# or GAMMASPHERE @12# should provide\nsufficient resolution and high-fold statistics to extend these\nbands built upon the isomers and to find additional bands. It\nis expected that recoil isomer tagging will play a major role\nin identifying nuclei in this region and thereby bridge the gap\nin knowledge between the proton emitters and the less\nneutron-deficient nuclei that can be studied by heavy-ion\nfusion-evaporation reactions with stable beam and target\ncombinations without the requirement of additional channel\nselection.\nFIG. 11.
