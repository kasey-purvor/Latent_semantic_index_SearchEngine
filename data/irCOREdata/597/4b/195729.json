Introduction\n[2] A sawtooth event is a prolonged interval during\nwhich quasiperiodic large intensifications of the particle\nfluxes occur at geosynchronous altitude [Belian et al., 1995;\nHenderson et al., 2006]. Sawtooth events occur generally\nduring storms, when the ring current is enhanced and the\nIMF is continuously southward (on average) for prolonged\nintervals of time. The shape of the proton flux vs. time\ncurve during these intervals exhibits quasi-periodic rapid\nincreases followed by slow decreases, resembling the teeth\nof a saw blade [Henderson et al., 2006]. These events are\nsimilar to a sequence of quasi-periodic substorms, although\na shock-induced triggering has sometimes been observed\n[Henderson et al., 2006, and references therein]. Substorms\nevolve on timescales of about three hours [Akasofu, 1964;\nMcPherron, 1970], and consist essentially in a cycle of open\nflux production on the dayside and transport to the nightside\nwhere it is eventually closed. This process is also primarily\nresponsible for convection in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere-\nionosphere system [Dungey, 1961; Cowley and Lockwood,\n1992].\n[3] We have developed a method that combines ground\nbased measurements of the ionospheric convection from the\nSuper Dual Aurora Radar Network (SuperDARN) and\nimages of the proton aurora from the Spectrographic Imager\nat 121.8 nm (SI12) instrument of the IMAGE-FUV exper-\niment [Mende et al., 2000a, 2000b] to estimate the amount\nof open magnetic flux in the magnetosphere as well as the\nrate of production of open magnetic flux on the dayside and\nof flux closure in the magnetotail [Hubert et al., 2006a].\nAccording to Faraday\u2019s law, the rate of change of the open\nflux can be expressed as a voltage, so that the reconnection\nrates are given as opening and closure voltages. The SI12\nimages of the proton aurora are used to estimate the location\nand motion of the open\/closed boundary [Hubert et al.,\n2006a]. The SuperDARN data are used to obtain the iono-\nspheric electric field [Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998]. We use\nthis information to compute the electric field in the frame of\nreference of the moving boundary and finally the opening\nand closure voltages. In the present study, we apply this\nmethod to sawtooth events previously reported in the\nliterature. The WIC and SI13 images of the IMAGE-FUV\nexperiment [Mende et al., 2000a, 2000b] are also used to\nanalyze the development of the auroral activity during the\nsawtooth event. The WIC and SI13 instruments are sensi-\ntive to emissions that are present in the dayglow and in the\naurora due to both electron and proton precipitation. The\nSI12, on the other hand, produces images of the Doppler-\nshifted Lyman-a emission, which is solely produced by the\nproton aurora. Dayglow contamination of the SI12 images\nis minor.\n2. Sawtooth Event of 18 April 2001\n[4] Huang et al. [2004] listed several sawtooth events\ndetected using geosynchronous measurements of particle\ndata. One of them occurred on 18 April 2001 between 00\nand 08 UT. During this interval, SI12 images of the proton\naurora were collected between 00 and 05 UT, comple-\nmented with SuperDARN measurements of the ionospheric\nconvection. This allows us to estimate the magnetic open\nflux and the opening and closure voltages during a signif-\nicant fraction of the sawtooth interval, although the Super-\nDARN coverage was not always good during that time.\nFigure 1 shows the open flux and reconnection voltages\nbased on these data. The net voltage, which is the sum of the\nopening and closure voltage, represents the time derivative\nof the open flux. It depends only on variations of the polar\ncap size, and does not, therefore, depend on the ionospheric\nconvection, whereas the opening and closure voltages do.\nAt the beginning of the interval, the magnetosphere had\naccumulated more than 0.8 GWb of open flux (Figure 1a).\nThis is a rather large value, sufficient to power a strong\nsubstorm [Milan et al., 2007]. The particle data from the\nLANL-01A spacecraft suggest that a substorm onset occurs\nat 0047 UT [Huang et al., 2004]. At that time, a solar\nwind shock, recorded by the ACE satellite at 0005 UT\n(Figure 1h), reached the magnetosphere and triggered the\nprocess of magnetic flux closure. The shock, associated\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 35, L23301, doi:10.1029\/2008GL036374, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Laboratory for Planetary and Atmospheric Physics, University of\nLie`ge, Lie`ge, Belgium.\n2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/08\/2008GL036374$05.00\nL23301 1 of 6\nwith a sudden rise of both the solar wind speed from \u0001370\nto \u0001500 km\/s and of the density from \u00018 to \u000126 cm\u00023\n(Figures 1f and 1g), actually reached the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nsphere shortly before 0048 UT and produced a dayside\nsubauroral proton flash (DSPF) in the SI12 image at\n0047:52 UT. A DSPF is known to be a typical signature\nof the compression of the dayside magnetosphere by a solar\nwind dynamic pressure front [Hubert et al., 2003], and\nfurther compression of the magnetotail is also known to be\ncapable of stimulating the formation of an X line in the\nplasma sheet, where open magnetic flux is closed [Bou-\ndouridis et al., 2005; Hubert et al., 2006b].\n[5] The closure voltage estimated shortly after the shock\narrival reaches \u0001\u0002350 kV (Figure 1d), which is an\nextremely large value. Since most of this voltage comes\nfrom the motion of the polar boundary, the poor Super-\nDARN coverage at that time is not a key issue. By\ncomparison, Hubert et al. [2006a] reported substorms for\nwhich the closure voltage reached \u0001\u0002120 to \u0002150 kV. The\nopening voltage that we estimate reaches an extreme value\nFigure 1.

The rapid variations in the open flux represent\nthe noise level of the determination, such that smoothing is applied to produce the filtered curve. The solid vertical lines\nindicate two onsets reported by Huang et al. [2004]. The dotted vertical line indicates a maximum of the geosynchronous\nparticle flux around 0424 UT. (j) TheWIC images show the associated revival of the auroral activity that propagates eastward\ntowards the noon sector, indicated by the overlaid arrows. The solar wind dynamic pressure front recorded by ACE shortly\nafter 0000 UT was due to a sharp increase of both the solar wind density and velocity. It reached the Earth at 0048 UT and\ntriggered a massive flux closure reaching \u0001\u0002350 kV that resulted in a reduction of the open flux by \u00010.3 GWb. The IMF\nwas southward for most of the time, and the IMF Bz component reached \u000226 nT.\nL23301 HUBERT ET AL.: FLUX CLOSURE DURING SAWTOOTH EVENTS L23301\n2 of 6\nof \u0001180 kV at \u00010200 UT (Figure 1c). This is due to the\ngenerally strong southward IMF and large solar wind\nvelocity (Figures 1f and 1i) that favour reconnection on\nthe dayside. Huang et al. [2004] report two other onsets at\n0306 UT and 0600 UT. In addition, the energetic particle\nflux also slowly reaches a maximum around 0424 UT\nmarked by the vertical dashed line (Figure 1e), which is\nnot identified as one of the substorm onsets of the sawtooth\nsequence. The closure voltage that we compute progres-\nsively intensifies around 0300 UT, and reaches values as\nlarge as \u0002100 kV around 0310 UT (Figure 1d), i.e., typical\nof what can be expected at the time of a substorm expan-\nsion. Note that, around 0300 UT, the SuperDARN coverage\nwas very good in the midnight sector. Around 0424 UT,\nthe intensification of the closure voltage is conspicuous\n(Figure 1d), considering that the resolution of our method of\nestimation of the reconnection voltages is \u000112\u201314 minutes.\nFor this sawtooth event, the development of the sawtooth\nsequence in the measured particle flux appears to be inti-\nmately related with the process of magnetic reconnection\nduring an interval in which the magnetosphere is strongly\nloaded with open magnetic flux.\n[6] The FUVobservations from the WIC and SI13 instru-\nments also support the results presented above. The shock-\ninduced flux closure starting at 0048 UT, which initiates the\nsawtooth sequence, has the typical auroral signatures of a\nshock-induced aurora in the WIC and SI13 images (not\nshown) [Meurant et al., 2003, 2004]: the brightening first\noccurs on the dayside oval, then brightenings reminiscent of\na (multiple) expansion onset appear on the nightside, and\nthe auroral intensification propagates to the entire oval. This\ntakes place along with a massive retraction of the polar cap,\nas a consequence of the flux closure in the tail, consistently\nwith the voltages of Figures 1b and 1d. The SuperDARN\nradar recorded a strong enhancement of the ionospheric\nconvection on the dayside right after the solar wind shock\nreached the magnetosphere, a phenomenon already reported\nby Boudouridis et al. [2007], until 0200 UT, i.e., at the end\nof the shock-induced flux closure episode. The oval remains\nactive at later UT, and the polar cap size increases as a\nnatural consequence of the strongly southward IMF and\nhigh opening voltage that we described above, consistently\nwith the voltages of Figures 1b and 1c. An auroral bright-\nening typical of a pseudobreakup is seen at 0256 UT, shortly\nfollowed by an expansion onset at 0305 UT. Pseudobreak-\nups are known to close magnetic flux [Hubert et al., 2006a],\nbut as the pseudobreakup and the onset are separated in time\nby 9 min only, our method cannot resolve both signatures\n(Figure 1d). This explains why the closure intensification\nseems to be progressive. In fact, a substorm expansion takes\nplace while the auroral and magnetospheric activity remains\nhigh, powered by a strong production of open flux on the\ndayside that reaches the tail some time later, after the field\nlines have been dragged tailward by the solar wind flow.\nThis constantly feeds the system with fresh open flux and\nenergy that keep on powering the reconnection process that\neventually lights up the aurora in the ionosphere. The\nauroral activity remains very high throughout the rest of\nthe interval, during which it is very difficult to identify\nphases of the substorm cycle. There is however a signature\nseen in the FUV images which occurs in the dawn sector of\nthe oval at 0426 UT and appears to propagate towards the\ndayside of the oval, which results in an obvious reduction of\nthe polar cap area (Figure 1j). It is natural to think that this\nrevival of activity is related to the flux closure found around\n0424 UT (Figures 1a, 1b, and 1d), but one can hardly\nanalyze it in terms of an isolated expansion phase. It rather\nappears as a reactivation of the expansion phase that started\nat 0305 UT. This reactivation is, again, powered by the large\nrate of flux opening on the dayside.\n[7] The sawtooth interval presented above is thus char-\nacterized by (1) a very high rate of flux opening on the\ndayside that results in a magnetosphere strongly loaded with\nopen flux, (2) a shock-induced flux closure with typical\nauroral signatures and an enormous rate of flux closure\nreaching \u0002350 kV, followed by (3) a typical substorm\nexpansion phase starting with a substorm onset preceded\nby a pseudobreakup and (4) a reactivation of the activity\nassociated with the latter expansion phase before the mag-\nnetosphere had a chance to return to a quiet state, powered\nby the ongoing production of open flux on the dayside.\n3. Sawtooth Event of 24 October 2002\n[8] Huang et al. [2004] also report a sawtooth event\noccurring between 0200 and 2400 UT on 24 October 2002.\nSI12 observations are available for that day between 1120\nand 1610 UT, allowing us to estimate the location of the\nopen\/closed field line boundary during that interval. At that\ntime, the SuperDARN radar network only offered a cover-\nage of the dayside ionosphere, but the method developed by\nRuohoniemi and Baker [1998] is used to reconstruct the\nionospheric electric field across the whole polar region.\nFigures 2a, 2c, and 2d show the open magnetic flux and\nopening and closure voltages that we obtain for this interval.\nBased on particle measurements from the LANL 1991-080\nspacecraft, Huang et al. [2004] report onsets at 1048, 1400\nand 1650 UT. The IMAGE-FUV viewing geometry was too\npoor around 1048 UT to estimate the polar cap boundary\nlocation. The intensification of the particle flux around 1130\nUT (Figure 2e) is also seen as an intensification of the FUV\nbrightness and appears as a revival of the ongoing expan-\nsion phase (Figure 2j). We have useful data for the onset at\n1400 UT only. At that time, the magnetosphere is loaded\nwith \u00010.9 GWb of open flux (Figure 2a). Throughout the\ninterval, the amount of open flux remains high, with a lower\nbound of \u00010.5 GWb and an upper bound of \u00010.9 Gwb.\nThis is due to the orientation of the IMF which is southward\nthroughout the interval, with a few northward excursions\n(Figure 2i). The solar wind dynamic pressure remains rather\nsteady, although a \u00011 nPa variation was recorded by the\nACE satellite around 1100 UT (Figure 2h). The onset\nrecorded at 1400 UT in the geosynchronous particle flux\nis clearly associated with an intensification of the closure\nvoltage (Figure 2d). However, another intensification of the\nclosure voltage is also recorded earlier, around 1225 UT,\nwithout a specific signature in the particle data, except that\nthe magnitude of the flux slowly reaches a maximum value\naround that time (Figure 2e), in association with the\nevolution of the substorm expansion of the sawtooth se-\nquence observed after 1048 UT. Note that, in our data,\nintensifications of the closure voltage are not always asso-\nciated with a sharp signature in the measured particle flux.\nThis may indicate that flux closure does not necessarily\nL23301 HUBERT ET AL.: FLUX CLOSURE DURING SAWTOOTH EVENTS L23301\n3 of 6\nproduce an additional particle injection, or that the injection\nis not strong enough to be identified, or that it can be\nlocalized so that it does not always appear in in-situ\ngeosynchronous measurements.\n[9] An expansion onset is seen at 1354 UT with the WIC\ncamera. This onset evolves into an expansion phase in terms\nof auroral morphology, but the polar cap does not dramat-\nically shrink, as can be expected from the evolution of the\nopen magnetic flux (Figure 2a): the open magnetic flux does\nnot dramatically decrease, as a consequence of the massive\nflux opening that takes place on the dayside, with the\nreconnection voltage reaching \u0001270 kV during the growth\nphase of the substorm (Figures 2b and 2c), i.e., an extremely\nlarge value. One could argue that, as the SuperDARN\ncoverage is not very good on the nightside at that time,\nthis value could be overestimated. However, the net voltage,\nwhich does not depend on the SuperDARN data, peaks at\n\u0001200 kV at that time, so that the opening voltage undoubt-\nedly reached a value larger than 200 kV. After the onset, the\ndayside flux opening voltage remains high (Figure 2c), so\nthat the open flux value does not dramatically decrease\ndespite the vigorous closure in the tail (Figures 2a, 2b, and\n2d). The closure of flux that we find around 1224 UTwith a\npeak closure voltage at 1230 UT does not seem to have the\ntypical auroral signatures of an expansion phase: no bright\nonset signature, no typical modification of the auroral\nmorphology (bulge etc.). Nevertheless, it reduces the open\nflux of the magnetosphere over an interval of more than\n30 minutes (Figures 2a, 2b, and 2d). The viewing geometry\nof the FUV instruments is not very favourable at that time,\nand details of the nightside aurora are difficult to analyze, but\nit is clear that the aurora remained bright throughout the\nFigure 2.

It is thus certainly possible that the intensification\nof the closure voltage that we record around 1225 UT could\nbe a reactivation of the closure process associated with the\nexpansion of the sawtooth sequence that was reported to\nstart at 1048 UT by Huang et al. [2004]. In the absence of\nFUV data at that time, it is however hard to check the\nvalidity of this hypothesis: we have no measurement of the\nopen flux and reconnection voltages at the time of the onset\nnor later, until the viewing geometry of the FUV instru-\nments improves.\n[10] It must be pointed out here that the main common\ncharacteristic of both events presented so far is the large\nvalue of the open magnetic flux due to a large rate of\nreconnection that opens flux on the dayside when the\nstrongly southward IMF merges with the magnetospheric\nfield. From that standpoint, although it does not appear in\nour data, it is also natural to think that when the IMF returns\nto a northward orientation or to a smaller southward\ncomponent, the magnetosphere then also progressively\nreturns to a more quiet state after it has closed the previ-\nously open flux, which ends the sawtooth sequence.\n4. Other Sawtooth Events\n[11] Other FUV observations coincident with sawtooth\nevents reported by Huang et al. [2004] and Henderson et al.\n[2006] can be identified. We considered the sawtooth events\nthat occurred on 11 August 2000, 4 October 2000, 14\nOctober 2000, 22 October 2001, and 18 April 2002. Our\nresults were of slightly lower quality for these intervals due\nto incomplete coverage of the proton aurora by the SI12\nfield of view, lower brightness of the proton aurora, higher\nbackground in the SI12 images due to different orientation\nof the instrument with respect to the Sun direction etc.,\nduring at least a part of the sawtooth interval with FUV\ncoverage. It follows that the open flux that we compute is\nmore noisy, as a result of the less accurate determination of\nthe polar cap boundary. The reconnection voltages are then\nless accurate as well. Nevertheless, the same main tendency\nis found for these intervals: the sawtooth events are found to\ndevelop when the open magnetic flux is high. It was more\nthan 1 GWb during a large part of these intervals, and\nreached \u00011.2 GWb during all of them. The high magnetic\nflux values result from the large reconnection voltage on the\ndayside during prolonged intervals, in agreement with the\nsolar wind data from the ACE satellite showing a strongly\nsouthward IMF for most of the time during these intervals,\nwhich is consistent with a very efficient loading of the\nmagnetosphere with open flux.\n5. Summary and Conclusions\n[12] The general picture that emerges from the case\nstudies presented here is that a sawtooth event is actually\na sequence of substorms taking place during an interval of\nstrongly southward IMF that loads the magnetosphere with\nopen flux, and keeps the amount of open flux at a high level\ndespite the closure in the tail. As reported by Henderson et\nal. [2006], the closure process can be triggered by a solar\nwind shock, because an increase of the solar wind dynamic\npressure favours the formation of an X line in the plasma\nsheet, but it is not a necessary condition. Further substorm\nexpansions develop and relax the loaded magnetosphere,\nalthough there may be insufficient time for a complete\nrecovery to take place before the closure rate intensifies\nagain, as fresh open flux reaches the tail after vigorous\nopening on the dayside. The relation that we find between\nflux closure and the sawtooth events are consistent with that\nof Henderson et al. [2006], who reported a dipolarization of\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit and an\nonset signature in the WIC images followed by a substorm\nexpansion on 18 April 2002. The picture proposed here is\nconsistent with the reconnection voltages that we compute\nand with the general characteristics of the auroral morphol-\nogy. Ultimately, the factor that appears to be responsible for\nthe sawtooth is a strongly southward IMF that overfeeds the\nmagnetospheric system with open flux and energy during\na prolonged time interval. We note that the strongly\nsouthward IMF condition was already reported previously\n[Henderson et al., 2006, and references therein]. It follows\nthat the open flux produced is closed by reconnection in the\ntail to balance the production of open flux on a long time\nscale, which produces the sawtooth sequence of flux closure\nand geosynchronous particle flux activation on a shorter\ntime scale.\n[13] Acknowledgments.
