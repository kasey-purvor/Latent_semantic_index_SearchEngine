INTRODUCTION\nThere is a considerable interest at the interface of physics,\nchemistry, and biology, on the response of solvated mol-\necules to the physical environment, and the behavior of mol-\necules and nanoparticles immersed in a liquid can be com-\nplex. It is apparent that the solvent that surrounds a molecule\nmay have an important physical effect on the molecule. The\nsolvent exerts a pressure, called solvation pressure, which\nacts in addition to any externally applied pressure. In gen-\neral, one of the effects of the solvation pressure is to com-\npress molecular bonds. The shortening of molecular bonds\nleads to an associated increase in bond vibrational frequen-\ncies which can be measured using Raman spectroscopy. The\nsolvation pressure effect has been observed using Raman\nspectroscopy for nanosized objects such as carbon\nnanotubes,1\u20133 starch grains,4 and for solvent mixtures.5,6\nThe folding of proteins is an important example of how a\nmolecule responds to its physical environment and life de-\npends on the ability of proteins in an aqueous environment to\nswitch reversibly between complex folded structures and\nvarious degrees of unfolding. The consequences of incorrect\nfolding are seen in the prion diseases, scrapie in sheep, BSE\nin cattle, and new-variant C Jakob disease and Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease in humans. Proteins may reconfigure in response to\npH and ion concentration, as well as to the thermodynamic\nvariables of temperature and pressure.7,8 Hydrogen bonding\nis also known to influence protein folding.9\nIn this paper, we examine the solvation pressure effect on\nethanol, a hydrogen-bonded liquid. One of the aims of this\nwork is to establish the limitations of the solvation pressure\nmodel for ethanol. Ethanol is chosen for two reasons: first,\nexcellent experimental data are available for bulk properties\nand for the Raman spectra as a function of applied pressure;\nsecond, ethanol contains many of the bond types found in\nproteins and so can serve as a relatively simple prototype to\na protein system.\nThe solvation pressure model states that the pressure ex-\nperienced by the solute is equal to the cohesive energy den-\nsity \u0001CED\u0002 of the solvent, defined as the energy of vaporiza-\ntion per unit volume,\nCED =\n\u0002Uvap\nVL\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0002Uvap is the molar internal energy change on vapor-\nization and VL is the molar volume of the liquid. The internal\nenergy change on vaporization is easily obtained from a mo-\nlecular dynamics simulation but, experimentally, it is \u0002Hvap,\nthe molar enthalpy of vaporization, that is measured. The\ntwo molar energies are related by\nHvap = Uvap + PVvap, \u00012\u0002\nwhere Vvap is the molar volume of the vapor and P is the\npressure. A similar expression can be written for the liquid\nphase and since Vvap\u0003VL, it is straightforward to show that\n\u0002Hvap = \u0002Uvap + RT , \u00013\u0002\nassuming that the van der Waals formula holds for the vapor.\nThus, the CED can be deduced from a measurement of the\nmolar enthalpy of vaporization through Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00013\u0002 and\nis often expressed in pressure units. For example, the CED of\nwater is about 24 kbar, about 7 kbar for ethanol, and 3 kbar\nfor chloroform \u00011 J m\u22123\u000510\u22125 bar\u0002. It is immediately evi-\ndent that there is the prospect of using solvent mixtures, in\nprinciple, to control the effective pressure experienced by\nnanosized objects contained in the mixture.10\nIt is noted that the internal pressure of a liquid, \u0004int, is\ndefined as the derivative of its internal energy with respect to\nvolume so that\n\u0004int = \u0006 \u0001U\u0001V \u0007T = n\u0002UvapVL , \u00014\u0002\nwhere n is a dimensionless ratio which has been related to\nthe strength of the intermolecular forces in the liquid11 and\nmay also indicate the likely validity of the solvation pressure\nmodel. For example, n\b1 for nonpolar liquids and n\n\b0.43 for ethanol.12\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 104303 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/76\u000110\u0002\/104303\u00016\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society104303-1\nThe solvation pressure or an applied external uniform hy-\ndrostatic pressure will tend to reduce the mean bond lengths\nin a solute molecule. A molecule immersed in a solvent with\na high CED should reveal bond lengths that would be, on\naverage, shorter for the same molecule in a solvent with a\nlow CED. Direct measurements of these bond lengths are\ndifficult to obtain but can be deduced from Raman spectros-\ncopy. Here, the vibrational frequencies of the various modes\nof vibration of a molecule are obtained and, by performing\nexperiments under uniform hydrostatic pressure, the change\nin frequency with applied pressure for key modes can be\nobtained. In general, as the applied pressure is increased, the\nbond lengths become shorter and the frequencies tend to in-\ncrease. The equivalence of an applied external hydrostatic\npressure and solvation pressure can be tested by comparing\nthe change in the vibrational frequency of a particular bond\ntype to the vapor molecule. The change in the vibrational\nfrequency of a molecule of ethanol vapor when immersed in\nethanol liquid, for example, should be equivalent to about\n7 kbar of hydrostatic pressure applied to the liquid if the\nsolvation pressure is a real pressure experienced by each\nmolecule.\nThere are also, of course, many alternative theoretical\nmodels to describe how solute molecules are affected by\nsolvent-solute interactions, notably, the statistical mechanical\ntheory invoking competition between short-range \u0001hard\nsphere\u0002 and long-range solvent-solute interactions of\nSchweizer and Chandler.13 This theory has been developed\nfurther by many authors.14,15 Good agreement with experi-\nment has often been found but with sensitive dependence on\nfitting parameters such as the hard-sphere radius of the sol-\nvent and the length scales of attractive solvent-solute\ninteractions.15\nThe strength of the solvation pressure model is its sim-\nplicity. The pressure effect of a solvent on a solute can be\nobtained simply from the CED of the liquid. However, the\nextent of the applicability of the solvation pressure model is\nnot well known and it is not expected that the solvation\npressure will always be the dominant physical effect. For\nexample, a high degree of local order or complex interatomic\ninteractions, such as hydrogen bonding, might lead to inter-\nactions that dominate and hence mask the ubiquitous solva-\ntion pressure effect.\nThis paper reports the results of extensive explicit-atom\nmolecular dynamics simulations of pure ethanol liquid and\nvapor. Here, ethanol acts as both the solvent and solute. We\nshow that the change in bond length with pressure is well\ndescribed by the solvation pressure model for all bonds ex-\ncept for O-H due to masking by hydrogen-bonding forces.\nII. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS\nA. Ethanol model\nAtom-specific potentials are required for the simulation of\nethanol liquid as one of the aims is to examine the vibra-\ntional properties of specific bonds. Cornell potentials for or-\nganic molecules16 were chosen as they are atom specific,\nfunctional forms are simple, the bulk properties of ethanol at\nroom temperature are well reproduced, and simulations are\nmore stable than the Dreiding17 potentials used in the previ-\nous work.4\nIn the Cornell model, all intramolecular bonds are simple\nharmonic potentials given by\nU\u0001r\u0002 =\n1\n2\nk\u0001r \u2212 r0\u00022, \u00015\u0002\nwhere k is the spring constant, r is the distance between the\nbonded atoms, and r0 is the equilibrium distance between\nbonded atoms. Three-body angular potentials are also har-\nmonic,\nU\u0001r\u0002 =\n1\n2\nk\u0001\u0005 \u2212 \u00050\u00022, \u00016\u0002\nwhere \u0005 is the angle formed by two bonds and \u00050 is the\nequilibrium angle. Finally, the dihedral four-body potentials\nare of the form\nU\u0001r\u0002 = A\u00031 + cos\u0001m\u0006 \u2212 \u0007\u0002\u0004 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere \u0006 is the dihedral angle.\nDuring the initial testing of this model, it was found nec-\nessary to replace the simple harmonic term describing the\nC-H bonds with a more accurate Morse potential in order to\nreproduce the high frequency carbon-hydrogen vibrational\nmodes. The Morse potential is defined as\nU\u0001r\u0002 = E0\u201e\t1 \u2212 exp\u0003\u2212 k\u0001r \u2212 r0\u0002\u0004\n2 \u2212 1\u2026 , \u00018\u0002\nwith values given as in the Dreiding model, namely, E0\n=70 kg m2 s\u22122, r0=1.09 \u00c5, and k=2.24 \u00c5\u22121.\nIntermolecular forces are modeled with Lennard-Jones\n\u000112-6\u0002 potentials,\nU\u0001r\u0002 = \u0006 A\nr12\n\u0007 \u2212 \u0006 B\nr6\n\u0007 , \u00019\u0002\nand Coulombic two-body terms, whose charges are given by\nthe restrained electrostatic potential \u0001RESP\u0002 model18 as pro-\nvided by Cheatham et al.19 All parameters are presented in\nTables I\u2013V.\nB.

The tem-\nperature was then raised in 50 K steps to 298 K as an NVT\nensemble \u0001constant number of particles, volume and tem-\nperature\u0002 using the Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat and equilibrated\nfor about 106 time steps at each stage. Finally, the volume\nwas reduced using a NPT ensemble \u0001constant number of par-\nticles, pressure, and temperature\u0002 using a short time step of\n0.0002 fs with a target pressure of 30 kbar. The target pres-\nsure is not reached during the short NPT run but the cell\ndimension reduces by about 0.01 nm. Equilibration for about\n106 time steps of 0.2 fs is followed by a repeat of the NPT\nrun to reduce the volume further. Repetition of this\nNVT-NPT sequence produces a simulation cell containing\n100 ethanol molecules at normal temperature and pressure.\nFurther repetitions of the NVT-NPT cycle produce simula-\ntion cells containing ethanol prepared at a range of pressure\nfrom about \u22121 to 15 kbar.\nMD simulations were then undertaken using the NVE en-\nsemble for 106 time steps of 0.2 fs with the thermodynamic\ndata recorded every 100 time steps and the atomic positions\nevery 25 time steps. It is noted that use of the NVE ensemble\nat this stage is essential as the normal thermostat \u0001Nos\u00e9-\nHoover\u0002 for NVT ensembles scales the atomic velocities and\nthe normal barostat \u0001Berendsen\u0002 for NPT ensembles scales\nthe volume and hence bond lengths. Both therefore interfere\nwith quantities we wish to measure. The pressure was moni-\ntored throughout each run and equilibrium was verified by\nensuring that there was no pressure drift. The standard de-\nviation of the pressure fluctuations was typically 1.5 kbar.\nThe vibrational frequency spectrum was obtained from\nthe atomic velocities by evaluating the velocity autocorrela-\ntion function, namely,\nRv\u0001t\u0002 \u0005 lim\nT\u2192\b\n1\nT\u000b0\nT\nv\u0001\t\u0002v\u0001t + \t\u0002d\t , \u000110\u0002\nwhere v\u0001t\u0002 is the velocity of an atom at time t with averaging\nover all atoms in all molecules and all possible time origins.\nThe Fourier transform of Rv\u0001t\u0002 yields the vibrational spec-\ntrum. In this case, due to the duration and time between data\nacquisition, data were in the range 0\u20133300 cm\u22121 at a resolu-\ntion of 3.33 cm\u22121. The resolution is comparable to the ex-\nperimental data and was limited by the amount of velocity\ndata that could be stored prior to processing.\nThe choice of system size \u0001100 molecules, 900 atoms\u0002\nwas constrained by the need for lengthy simulations for sta-\ntistical averaging and the need to record the atomic positions\nTABLE III.

Larger simulations were not practical\nand, while the possibility of finite-size effects cannot be ex-\ncluded, we believe that simulations of 900 atoms are large\nenough for these effects to be small. For example, Allen and\nTildesley note that simulations of several hundred atoms are\nsufficient for finite-size effects to be negligible20 and Heyes\net al.21 observe for a variety of physical quantities that finite-\nsize effects are negligible for hard-sphere fluids in simula-\ntions in excess of about 1000 particles.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTable VI shows some bulk properties of ethanol deter-\nmined from the simulation. The cohesive energy density was\ncalculated using Eq. \u00011\u0002, where the internal energy change on\nvaporization was obtained by subtracting the internal energy\nof the vapor from the average internal energy for the liquid\nunder zero pressure.\nThe CED was calculated to be 6.52 kbar which is in very\ngood agreement with the experimental value of 6.76 kbar.\nThe density was found to be in good agreement with experi-\nment, showing a 2.6% deviation from the experimental\nvalue. The compressibility C was calculated using\nC =\n1\nV\f \u0001V\u0001P\fP=0. \u000111\u0002\nThe volume per mole was plotted against the volume at zero\npressure and the gradient was divided by the intercept to give\na value for the compressibility, which was consistent with\nexperiment within experimental error.\nFigure 1 shows the C-H3, C-H2, and C-C bond lengths of\nethanol as a function of pressure. The bond lengths for the\nvapor are plotted at \u22126.76 kbar, equal to the CED of the\nliquid, as the vapor will not experience the solvation pressure\nfelt by the liquid. The line is obtained from the linear regres-\nsion of the liquid-only data. The error bars on the vapor data\nrepresent a standard error of 103 separate vapor data runs.\nThe line passes through the vapor data in each case, within\nerror, consistent with the solvation pressure model. In other\nwords, the application of a uniform hydrostatic pressure\ncompresses the C-H3, C-H2, and C-C bond lengths in the\nsame manner as the solvation pressure acting on the liquid at\nnormal pressure compared to the vapor.\nFigure 2 shows the length of the C-O and O-H bonds,\nagain as a function of pressure. The O-H bond increases in\nlength as a function of applied pressure and neither bond\nappears to give a fit to the solvation pressure model, a fact\nwhich can be attributed to the strength of the hydrogen bond-\ning on the O-H tail, as will be discussed later.\nThe simulated vibrational spectra were obtained by com-\nputing the autocorrelation function and Fourier transforming,\nas described in the previous section. The peaks were then fit\nto a Lorentzian to determine the peak position. In order to\nassist with the identification of modes, it was possible to\ncompute the autocorrelation function using only atoms of\ninterest, for example, to place the C-C-O modes, one can\nperform the Fourier transform using only those atoms. Seven\nclear modes are the C-C-O symmetric stretch, C-C-O anti-\nsymmetric stretch, C-H3 rock \u0001 C-O stretch \u0001 in plane\nC-O-H deformation, CH2 twist and in-plane C-O-H deforma-\ntion, C-H3 deformation, C-H2 symmetric stretch, and C-H3\nstretch \u0001Table VII\u0002.

The\nerrors on the vapor data are larger than for the bond lengths\ndue to the uncertainty in fitting a Lorentzian to peaks which\nare subject to statistical variation. However, the errors of\naround \u00b13 cm\u22121 are not large enough to distract from the\ngeneral trends in data. The straight lines are guides to the\neyes and represent linear regression of the liquid data only.\nIn Fig. 4, all modes increase in frequency from vapor to\nliquid consistent with the solvation pressure model for these\nmodes in ethanol.\nThe CH2 twist and in plane C-O-H deformation mode\nMO1 \u0001Fig. 5\u0002 appear to split in the vapor phase, producing\ntwo distinct peaks in the vapor vibrational spectra where\nonly a single combined peak appeared in the liquid phase.\nThe average of these two peaks gives a point which is con-\nsistent with the solvation pressure model. It would appear\nthat the C-O-H deformation mode occurs at a higher fre-\nquency in the vapor phase than in the liquid. This is consis-\ntent with the bond length data which shows the O-H bond to\nbe stretched by hydrogen bonding in the liquid phase. The\nanomalous behavior of a hydrogen-bonding group in the Ra-\nman peak has been observed on many occasions \u0001for ex-\nample, Ref. 14\u0002 since first noted by Drickamer and\nco-workers24,25 on butanol. In ethanol, too, the strength of\nthe hydrogen bonding dominates over the van der Waals in-\nteraction responsible for the solvation pressure effect.\nTABLE VII.

CONCLUSION\nThe results of explicit-atom molecular dynamics simula-\ntions of ethanol liquid and vapor are presented. The Cornell\nfield is used for the explicit-atom potentials with the term\ndescribing the two-body intramolecular C-H bond modified\nto a Morse potential to improve the accuracy of the C-H\nvibrational frequencies. Very good agreement with experi-\nment is obtained for density, compressibility, and CED of the\nethanol liquid. The liquid is subjected to applied hydrostatic\npressure in the range \u22121 to 15 kbar at room temperature and\nthe vibrational frequency spectra are calculated. The peak\nfrequency of seven vibrational modes was found to be accu-\nrate to within 100 cm\u22121 of their experimental positions and\nthe change of frequency as a function of pressure is consis-\ntent with Raman data. The change in bond length with pres-\nsure supports the solvation pressure model for all bonds ex-\ncept for O-H due to hydrogen bonding. We find that the O-H\nbond is lengthened with applied pressure in agreement with\nmany similar observations \u0001for example Refs. 14, 24, and\n25\u0002.\nWe conclude that the solvation pressure model is a useful,\nsimple model that correctly describes the change in bond\nlength and vibrational spectra from vapor to liquid and that\nthe results support the idea that solutes experience an applied\npressure equivalent to the cohesive energy density of the\nliquid. This ubiquitous pressure, however, is masked by cer-\ntain interaction such as hydrogen bonding which provides a\ndominant effect, leading to different bond length behaviors.\nThis leaves us cautious as to the general applicability to sys-\ntems in which hydrogen bonding is dominant such as, obvi-\nously, solutes in aqueous environments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nP.J.B. acknowledges the support of Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council \u0001UK\u0002.\n*d.faux@surrey.ac.uk\n1 J.
