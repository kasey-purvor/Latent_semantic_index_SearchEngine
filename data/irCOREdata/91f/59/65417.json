Specifically, \nwelfare state regime theory has been utilised (1-7). Such studies have consistently shown that Infant \nMortality Rates (IMR) vary significantly by welfare state regime. Life expectancy (LE) has been a less \nextensively used population health measure in such studies although those that have examined it \nhave tended to find some patterning by welfare state regime (6, 22). However, these studies have \nfocused exclusively on the welfare states of Europe, North America and Australasia. This focus \nignores the existence of welfare states in other parts of the world, specifically in East Asia. This study \ntherefore investigates whether the association between IMR, LE and welfare state regimes is still valid \nwhen the welfare states of East Asia are added into the analysis. It also examines whether population \nhealth is worse in the less established East Asian welfare states. \n \nWelfare state regimes  \nThe most influential of the welfare state regime typologies has been Esping-Andersen\u2019s The Three \nWorlds of welfare capitalism, which classified welfare states into three different welfare regime types \n(8-9): Liberal (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, UK, USA), Conservative (Finland, France, \nGermany, Japan, Italy, Switzerland) and Social Democratic (Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, \nNorway, Sweden). The states in the Liberal regime type are characterised by means-tested and \nresidual welfare provision (8). Whereas in the Conservative regime type, welfare programmes are \nbased on the wage-earner social-insurance model and the role of the family in welfare provision is \nemphasised (8). The welfare states of the Social Democratic regime are regarded as strongly \ninterventionist, distinguished by universalism and institutionalized redistribution based on a \ncommitment to full employment (8). \n \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s Three Worlds typology has resulted in extensive academic debate (10), resulting \nin the emergence of various modified or alternative welfare regime typologies. Of these typologies,  \nFerrera\u2019s four-fold typology of European welfare states (9) has been highlighted as one of the most \nempirically accurate (10). His typology contained three regimes - the Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, and \nBismarckian welfare regimes - which were broadly similar to Esping-Andersen\u2019s Social Democratic, \n 3 \nLiberal and Conservative regimes respectively (Table 1). However, Ferrera added a fourth regime - \nthe Southern regime (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain). Welfare provision in this regime has been \ndescribed as fragmented, due to diverse income maintenance schemes that range from extensive to \nminimal, and a restricted and partial health care system coverage (10). The regime is also \ncharacterised by a strong reliance on the family and on the charitable sector (9).  \n \nA more recent advancement in the welfare regimes literature is the emergence of Eastern European \ncountries as a possible regime type (10-12). The Eastern European countries were until recently \nneglected in welfare state analysis (8) largely because of the extensive economic instability and social \nreforms undergone throughout the 1990s (11). These reforms have seen the demise of the \nuniversalism of the Communist welfare state and a shift towards policies associated more with the \nliberal welfare state regime, notably marketisation and decentralisation. In comparison to other \nEuropean countries, they have limited health service provision (13). \n \nEast Asian Welfare States  \nIncreasingly, there have been calls to reformulate and expand welfare state regime theory to include \nthe East Asian countries (Hong Kong, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan) (14-18). The \nEast Asian welfare regime (sometimes referred to as Confucian) (21) can be characterised by a \nresidual approach, where there is low levels of government intervention and investment in social \nwelfare, underdeveloped public service provision with a strong reliance on family and voluntary sector \nin welfare provision (19). Table 2 summarises the main features of the East Asian welfare states and \neach country is overviewed below. The East Asian welfare regime contains welfare provision that is \nsimilar in extent and principle to that of the Liberal regime but with an increased emphasis on the role \nof the state leading to different welfare state structures. For example, White and Goodman (18) have \nreferred to the East Asian countries as \u2018developmental welfare systems\u2019, designed by governments to \nensure economic development and prosperity. Similarly, Aspalter (15) points out that although family \nand the market play an important role in the design of overall welfare provision, it is still strongly \nregulated by the East Asian governments. \n \n \n 4 \nSingapore is a quintessential illustration of this largely government-regulated welfare provision. The \nwelfare system of Singapore today is a product of the People\u2019s Action Party\u2019s (PAP) national \ndevelopment strategy, where the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and large-scale public housing \nschemes play a major role in its success (17). The CPF is a mandatory saving scheme where \ncontributions to an individual\u2019s account are made by the individual and his employer, according to a \nrate set by the labour laws. Part of the CPF savings can be used for purchasing public housing units \nand paying for healthcare, among others. Through such arrangements, social security in Singapore is \nthus entirely financed by the private sector, especially for the self-employed, while public expenditures \non social welfare are limited to education with some subsidies to public hospitals (41).  \n \nLike Singapore, Hong Kong\u2019s social security system is integrated such that the labour laws cover all \nemployees (41) through a mandatory saving scheme, the Mandatory Provident Fund (40). Despite \npublic assistance being limited to the very elderly, unemployed and vulnerable groups, the welfare \nstate system has evolved to include a long-term strategic partnership between the NGOs and the \ngovernment, which provides financial support (17). Social provisions in Hong Kong are limited to \neducation too, though it ensures a universal coverage of healthcare services (40). \n \nThe Japanese welfare state implements redistribution policies (17) through a national insurance \nsystem for pensions and healthcare (40). Though this is coupled with enterprise-based insurance (40) \nand there is universal coverage, welfare provision is still considered residual as social security is \nhighly fragmented along occupational lines (41). Private welfare provision is encouraged through the \nfamily and the community, especially for retired workers, although public pensions are sufficient for \nmost (41) and there is a public assistance system for the needy (40). \n \nSimilar to the other three countries, Korea has a national health insurance and pension system (40). \nThe Korean government provides unemployment benefits and universal healthcare services (41). \nNevertheless, though the extent of social security coverage has increased over the years, public \nwelfare assistance is still meagre and highly stigmatised (17). Moreover, occupations like daily \nlabourers and family helpers are uncovered by the pension system (41), while only a third of the paid \nworkforce is entitled to unemployment benefits (17). \n 5 \n \nIn Taiwan, the coverage for the national health and unemployment insurance system is universal, with \nan emphasis on social rights (17, 41). However, the national pension insurance scheme is based on \nemployment (40) where only civil servants and those of large firms will have sufficient funds to \nguarantee financial independence in old age due to the time needed for the funds to mature (41). \nLocal government do provide limited welfare services, with the family still playing a major role in social \nwelfare provision (40). \n \nWelfare state regimes and population health \nComparative studies on population health between countries have shown that health outcomes, \nespecially IMR, differ by welfare regime type. For example, Bambra\u2019s analysis (2) found significant \ndifferences in IMR between the three worlds of welfare: weighted IMR for the Liberal, Conservative \nand Social Democratic regimes were 6.7, 4.5 and 4.0 respectively. Navarro et al (6, 22) examined \ndifferences between four different welfare state regimes (grouped in terms of political traditions), \nwhere countries which have had long periods of government by redistributive political parties (most \nnotably the Social Democratic countries) were found to have experienced lower IMR and, to a lesser \nextent, increased LE. These findings were reinforced by Chung and Muntaneer\u2019s (3) multilevel \nlongitudinal analysis of welfare state regimes in which they found that around 20% of the difference in \nIMR among countries could be explained by the type of welfare state. Social Democratic countries \nhad significantly lower IMR compared to all other welfare state regimes. These differences have been \nexplained in terms of the comparatively generous, highly decommodifying and universal welfare \nprovision typical of the welfare states of this regime (3, 6, 20-24) and the accumulative positive effect \nof pro-redistribution political parties on income inequalities (6, 21, 24).  \n  \nMost of these studies, however, have relied exclusively on Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology (1, 4, 5) and \nthereby neglected to include countries in the Southern, Eastern European or East Asian regimes (3, 6, \n21). There has been a move towards including the newly formulated regimes in comparative health \nresearch, as seen in two recent studies by Eikemo and colleagues (10, 12), which included the \nEastern European regime (Eikemo et al., Table 1). Nevertheless, there has so far been no inclusion of \nthe East Asian regime in comparative epidemiological research of welfare state regimes and \npopulation health. This paper thus seeks to contribute to the progress of comparative health research \n 6 \nby adding the East Asian regime. Specifically, it tests if the association between health outcomes \n(IMR and LE) and welfare state regime type still exists with the addition of the East Asian regime. It \nalso examines whether population health is worse in the East Asian welfare states. Since generous \nwelfare provision and a high degree of decommodification have been associated with positive health \noutcomes, (2) the study also compares social expenditure and health care expenditure by welfare \nstate regime.  \n \nMETHODS \nTo test the above hypotheses, this study compares the variation in health status (IMR and LE) \nbetween 30 welfare states in Europe, North America, East Asia and the pacific region, categorized \ninto six different types of welfare state regimes based on an expansion of Ferrera\u2019s typology (9), by \nincluding two additional categories for Eastern Europe (10, 12) and East Asia (25) (Table 3). Social \nexpenditure and health care expenditure as a percentage of GDP are also compared.  GDP per capita \nis included as a possible confounding variable.  Although Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the \nUSA were not included in Ferrera\u2019s typology (9) as his focus was on Europe only, these countries \nhave been placed in the Anglo-Saxon regime following Bambra (2007) (26). Japan has been \ncategorised as an East Asian country. \n \nFollowing existing studies, population health is measured by IMR and LE. IMR is defined as the \nnumber of deaths of infants under one year of age in a given year, per 1,000 live births during that \nsame year. LE and IMR data were obtained from The World Factbook 2003 (27) as it contained the \nrequired data for all countries in this study, hence ensuring comparability. IMR and LE were chosen \nas the population health indicators for this study because they are routinely used as a comparative \nmeasure of health status between populations and countries (28). More importantly, IMR was chosen \nbecause previous studies have found that birth and infant-related indicators seem to be most sensitive \nto welfare state variables (1, 7, 22, 23) and it is widely considered to be a highly sensitive indicator of \npopulation health (29) and quality of life (22). LE was chosen as it has not yet been extensively \nexamined in terms of the welfare states and health literature (6, 22).  \n \n 7 \nSocial expenditure as a percentage of GDP (SE) is a variable that has been used to construct welfare \nstate typologies as it reflects the quantity of welfare state provision, is highly correlated with other \nindicators used to construct welfare state typologies, and has been shown to be the variable that \ndiscriminates most between the regime types (30). Data for this variable was extracted from the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Social Expenditure Database \n2007 (31) for the year 2003, except for Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, which were not included \nin the database. Comparable social expenditure data for these countries were calculated using data \nfrom the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Key Indicators 2007: Inequality in Asia (32), except for \nTaiwan, whose data were obtained from the Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of China 2006 (33). \n \nTotal expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP (HE) is also used as a comparison variable \nbetween the welfare states since healthcare is the largest area of welfare state service delivery (42). \nHealth spending differs among welfare states, but the general trend is that it tends to rise with GDP \nper capita (43). More significantly, higher spending appears to be associated with significant \nimprovements in health status, though this association is not applicable among the high spending \ncountries (44). Data for HE was also extracted from OECD Social Expenditure Database 2007 (31) for \nthe year 2003, except for Hong Kong, Singapore, Slovenia and Taiwan. Comparable HE data for \nHong Kong and Singapore were obtained from the WHO National Health Accounts (45), while \nSlovenia\u2019s was obtained from NationMaster (46) and Taiwan\u2019s was obtained from Australian Institute \nof Health and Welfare (AIHW) health expenditure database (47). \n \nGDP per capita is a reflection of a country\u2019s economic well-being (3). It is highly correlated with a \nnumber of health outcomes including IMR. Thus, it is included as a confounding variable to remove \neconomic wealth of welfare states from being a factor that can be associated with population health \noutcomes. Data for GDP per capita was extracted from OECD Social Expenditure Database 2007 \n(31) for the year 2003, except for Hong Kong, Singapore, Slovenia and Taiwan. Comparable HE data \nfor Hong Kong, Singapore, Slovenia and Taiwan were obtained from The World Factbook 2003 (27). \n \nAnalysis \nTo assess the extent to which cross-national differences of IMR, LE, GDP per capita, SE, and HE \ncould be explained by grouping countries according to welfare regime type, we performed one-way \n 8 \nANOVA tests. We then performed one way ANCOVA tests, with GDP per capita as a covariate. We \nspecifically tested whether the between group variance of IMR, LE, and SE (in separate steps) \ndiffered significantly from the within group variance when controlling for GDP per capita. Analyses of \nall data were carried out using SPSS version 15. \n \nRESULTS \nTable 4 contains descriptive data on all the variables used in the analysis in terms of minimum and \nmaximum values, means and standard deviations). Country level data for all variables are presented \nin Table 5. The Scandinavian welfare state regime had the lowest average IMR (3.98) ranging from \n3.42 (Sweden) to 4.9 (Denmark). The Eastern European welfare regime had the highest average IMR \n(6.83) rranging from 4.42 in Slovenia to 8.95 in Poland. The East Asian regime had the highest \naverage LE of 78.7 years, whilst the Eastern European had the lowest average LE of 74.19 years. LE \nof the East Asian countries ranged from 80.93 years (Japan) to 75.36 years (Korea). The LE for \nEastern European countries varied from 75.51 years (Slovenia) to 72.17 years (Hungary).  \n \nThe Scandinavian welfare regime had the highest SE, at 26.60%, whilst the East Asian had the lowest \naverage SE of 10.17%. SE of the Scandinavian countries ranged from 31.28% (Sweden) to 22.45% \n(Finland), while for East Asian countries, it varied from 17.73% (Japan) to 5.18% (Taiwan). Among all \nthe welfare states, Sweden spent the biggest proportion of their GDP on SE, whilst Taiwan spent the \nleast. In terms of HE, the Bismarckian welfare state regime had the highest average of 10.11% and \nthe East Asian regime had the lowest average of 5.22%. For the Bismarckian countries, Switzerland \nspent the most at 11.40%, while Luxembourg spent the least at 7.60%. Among the East Asian \ncountries, Japan had the highest expenditure at 8.10% and Taiwan had the least expenditure at \n3.00%. The Bismarckian welfare state regime had the highest GDP per capita of $35007 whilst the \nEastern European welfare regime had the lowest average of $16267. The GDP per capita for the \nBismarckian countries ranged from $60891 (Luxembourg) to $27697 (France). GDP per capita for the \nEastern European countries ranged from $19200 (Slovenia) to $12057.65 (Poland).  \n \nThe results of the one way ANOVA analyses (Table 6) showed that there is a significant difference by \nwelfare state regime in the magnitude of IMR, LE, SE, HE and GDP per capita. However, when \n 9 \ncontrolling for GDP per capita in the ANCOVA analyses, welfare state regime differences in IMR \n(R\n2\n=0.40, adjusted R\n2\n=0.24, p>0.05) and HE were no longer significant (R\n2\n=0.15, adjusted R\n2\n=0.07, \np>0.05). However, LE differed significantly by welfare state even when controlling for GDP per capita \nwith 47% of the difference explained by welfare state regime (R\n2\n=0.58, adjusted R\n2\n=0.47, p<0.05).  \nDifferences in SE (R\n2\n=0.70, adjusted R\n2\n=0.61, p<0.05) were also still significant.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nIMR did not vary significantly by welfare state regime once we controlled for GDP per capita. \nHowever, previous studies have shown that IMR does vary significantly between different types of \nwelfare regime (1, 3-6, 21). The inconsistency suggests that a closer examination of IMR as a health \nindicator for the comparative study of developed countries is warranted. Notably, there has been \nreported inconsistencies in the classification of infant death in different countries (34) and its \ncalculation is only from a small non-representative segment of the population (29). Moreover, \ncompared to IMR, newer measures such as disability adjusted life expectancy (DALE) (or health \nadjusted life expectancy- HALE) disability free life expectancy (DFLE) and active life expectancy \n(ALE) are regarded as more accurate reflections of population health and more sensitive to living \nconditions since they factor in disabling non-fatal health outcomes and their impact on quality of life \n(28, 29, 35). This consideration is especially significant in developed countries as increases in life \nexpectancy raises concerns about morbidity and quality of life in old age (36).   \n \nUsing LE as a population health indicator, the results show that health status between welfare states \nregimes still vary significantly even with the additional inclusion of the East Asian regime. This finding \nserves to reinforce the findings of previous studies (6, 26) which found that LE was significantly \nassociated with welfare state regime type. Contrary to expectations that it would be one of the worst \nhealth performers amongst the welfare regimes, the East Asian regime had the highest average LE. \nThe LE of Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong were higher than many of the welfare states in the other \nregime types, even those in the Scandinavian welfare regime. This finding is in contradiction to the \nexpectations of the welfare state regimes literature which has usually found that high social \nexpenditure and high decommodification results in better health outcomes (e.g. 2, 3). The fact that \nthis study has found that LE is high even within the rather minimalist East Asian welfare model \n 10 \nsuggests that other social and cultural public health factors are also of importance when comparing \ninternational health outcomes. Public health studies have long highlighted the healthy diet of the East \nAsian countries, and the smoking epidemic is less developed in these countries. Similarly, our study \nshows that despite having one of the highest average SE and HE, the Bismarckian and Anglo-Saxon \nwelfare state regimes had lower LE than the East Asian welfare regime. This finding thus lends itself \nto the conclusion that higher spending is not always associated with significant improvements in \nhealth status among the high spending countries (44). This may be due to lower levels of \ndecommodification, higher levels of income inequality, or on how the social expenditure is used (8).  \n \nTaken together, these results suggest that future research on welfare state regimes and population \nhealth needs to incorporate wider public health indicators, not just social policy ones. For example,  as \nin this study, health care expenditure (HE) and health care provision variables (such as proportion of \npublicly funded hospital beds) could be included in comparative analysis (37, 38), as could mediating \nhealth behaviour variables (such as smoking rates). This would lead into the construction and analysis \nof a wider public health-focused analytical framework: the \u2018public health regime\u2019(39). The \u2018public \nhealth regime\u2019 consists of the legislative, social, political, and economic structures that have an impact \non both public health and public health interventions (39). This analytical framework would enable the \nexpansion of comparative health research so that it includes East Asian, Latin American and other \npreviously overlooked countries (39). It will also enable an analysis of the efficacy of policy and \ninterventions for health outcomes of interest at both national and international level. At the \ninternational level, this analysis could help differentiate between those policies and interventions that \nare effective in different contexts and are therefore potentially applicable in other countries with similar \nconditions (39). \n \n \nLimitations \nNonetheless, the above evaluation of the main study findings should be reviewed with the \nmethodological limitations in mind. The analysis was not adjusted for other health factors (such as \nsmoking prevalence) which could all have a confounding effect on the study results. Furthermore, as \nthe main purpose was to investigate if previous study findings of significant health differences \nbetween welfare regimes still apply with the inclusion of the East Asian regime, this study was \n 11 \nconducted using data from only one year. Hence, the effects of changes in welfare policies that were \nlikely to have occurred in these welfare states on health outcomes were not captured. The application \nof Ferrera\u2019s expanded welfare regime typology is also a limitation. Due to the restricted scope of the \nstudy, the grouping of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and US within the Anglo-Saxon regime in the \ntypology was based on basic comparative observations of the other welfare regime typologies instead \nof ideally applying Ferrera\u2019s theoretical approach. The inclusion of the Eastern European and East \nAsian countries as additional welfare regimes was also not based on the application of Ferrera\u2019s \ntheoretical approach. Also, though Ferrera\u2019s typology may have been accurate when it was first \nformulated, it has been recognized that welfare regime patterns change over time (30) and the \nclassifications applied in this study may not be relevant for the year of data used. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nThis study has shown that the variation in health status between countries differs by the welfare state \nregime type, even with the inclusion of the East Asian welfare states. However, in contrast to other \nstudies, high social expenditure did not always result in better health outcomes. Future research in \ncomparative health analysis could thus benefit from being more inclusive of health system and health \nbehaviour factors - a \u2018public health regime\u2019 analysis (39). The development of such analysis would \nenable the inclusion of both the developed welfare states and the previously excluded less developed \nwelfare states, enabling a more comprehensive study of the structural mechanisms through which \nwelfare state and public health features influence population health outcomes (39). \n \n \n \nAuthor contribution statement \n \nSAK planned the study, collected data, conducted analysis and drafted the paper.
