They contain a tetravalent {Sn} centre and are classified as mono-, di-,\ntri- or tetra-organotin(IV)s, depending on the number of alkyl (R) or aryl (Ar) moieties [2]. These\ncompounds have been well-characterized structurally by infrared (IR), multinuclear NMR (1H,\n13C, 119Sn), 119mSn Mossbauer spectroscopy and mass spectrometry [3,4]. Among the organo-\ntins, organotin carboxylates are important; these contain a Sn-O bond formed through the COO-\ngroup and exhibit a number of interesting structural features because of the tendency of the ani-\nonic group to coordinate inter- or intra-molecularly to tin(IV) [5].\nMetal complexes, including organotin(IV) compounds, are used in a number of biomedical\nand commercial applications [6-9]. Their structural chemistry has attracted considerable atten-\ntion owing to their anti-tumour activity [3,4]. Understanding their mechanism of action may\nlead to the development of new anti-tumour drugs as they are less toxic than platinum-based\ndrugs [10]. Due to the diverse usage of these compounds, organic and inorganic forms of tin have\naccumulated in the food chain [10]. These compounds have varying degrees of toxicity, depend-\ning on the nature and number of alkyl groups bonded to the tin atom. Since a number of organ-\notins are toxic [11], there is concern that widespread usage may result in adverse effects within\nenvironmental and biological systems. Exposure to di- or tri-methyl, butyl or phenyl tin induced\naneuploidy in human lymphocyte cultures [12].\nTaking into account the structural and biological diversity of organotin(IV) carboxylates [13-\n16], we set out to determine whether attenuated total reflection-Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-\nFTIR) spectroscopy might be a novel biophysical approach that would allow one to identify\neffects associated with typical environmental exposures to mono-, di- and tri-derivatives. In the\noestrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, cytotoxicity was ascertained using\nthe clonogenic assay and, genotoxicity using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet)\nassay and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. Although a cancer cell line, MCF-7\ncells are robust cell model that have been used to examine genotoxic and toxic effects of candi-\ndate test agents [17-20]. Because they are metabolically proficient, they are also susceptible to\npossible metabolite effects [17,20]. Interrogation of IR spectral characteristics of cellular material\npreviously exposed to organotin(IV) carboxylates might be a novel and non-destructive method\nfor screening exposure effects at sub-cytotoxic and sub-genotoxic concentrations. The aim of this\nstudy was to determine whether IR spectra, in the biomolecular range (900 cm-1 \u2013 1800 cm-1),\nderived from organotin-treated MCF-7 cells might exhibit molecular alterations compared to\ncontrol cells following exposures as low as 0.0001 \uf06dg\/ml; such an approach would highlight the\ngeneral and potential applicability of mid-IR spectroscopy to signature toxic effects at sub-lethal\nconcentrations of compounds. Such a novel biophysical approach might facilitate the determi-\nnation of risk posed following typical environmental exposures to environmental contaminants.Page 2 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPMC Biophysics 2008, 1:3 http:\/\/www.physmathcentral.com\/1757-5036\/1\/3Methods\nChemicals\nThree groups of organotin(IV) carboxylates including mono-, di- and tri-derivatives of ligands\nwere examined; these included: 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenylpropenoic acid (L1), 3,4-\nmethylenedioxyphenylpropenoic acid (L2) and 2,3-methylenedioxybenzoic acid (L3). The\nchemicals were newly synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectra, multinu-\nclear NMR (1H, 13C, and119Sn) and mass spectroscopy [14,15].

Cells were grown in 5%\nCO2 in air at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere and disaggregated using a trypsin (0.05%)\/EDTA\n(0.02%) solution, to form single-cell suspensions prior to sub-culture or incorporation in exper-\niments [18].\nThe clonogenic assay\nTest agents were examined at three concentrations (0.1 \uf06dg\/ml, 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml and 10.0 \uf06dg\/ml) with\nDMSO as vehicle control. Aliquots of \uf0bb 0.5 \u00d7 103 MCF-7 cells in 5 ml complete medium were\nexposed to the various treatments in T25 flasks [17,19,20]. Cells were exposed under incubation\nconditions of 5% CO2 in air at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h, after which medium\nwas replaced with fresh medium [19]. Cells were then cultured for a further 7-day period, where-\nupon they were fixed with 70% ethanol (EtOH) and stained with 5% Giemsa; visible colonies\nwere subsequently scored [17,19,20]. Results are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of the average val-\nues derived from triplicate measurements for each treatment condition in three independent\nexperiments.\nThe alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay\nMicroscope slides were cleaned with 70% EtOH and pre-coated on one side with a 1% solution\nof normal melting point (NMP) agarose in H2O [21]. MCF-7 cells grown to confluence in 12-well\nmulti-well dishes were exposed in 1 ml of complete medium to various concentrations (0.01 \uf06dg\/\nml, 0.1 \uf06dg\/ml and 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml final concentrations) of test compound added as a solution in\nDMSO; DMSO was employed as the vehicle control and 1.0 \uf06dM benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) as pos-\nitive control [21,22]. Subsequent steps were carried out under a darkened environment. After 2-\nh exposure, cells were disaggregated with trypsin\/EDTA solution and re-suspended in 1 ml phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS). To this, an equal volume of a warm (\uf0bb 37\u00b0C) 1% solution of low\nmelting point (LMP) agarose in PBS was added. A 150-\uf06dl aliquot containing \uf0bb 5 \u00d7 104 cells was\nadded to coded slides. This LMP agarose layer was evenly spread through the application of a cov-\nerslip and allowed to set for 5 min on a cold surface. Coded slides were then submerged over-\nnight in cold (4\u00b0C) lysis solution [buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA disodium salt, 10 mM Tris,\n1% N-lauroyl sarcosine; adjusted to pH 10 with NaOH) with 1% Triton X-100 and 10% DMSO\nadded prior to use] [22]. The slides were then transferred to a horizontal electrophoresis tank,\ncovered in electrophoresis solution (0.3 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH > 13), and stored for 35 min\nat 10\u00b0C prior to electrophoresis at 0.8 V\/cm and 300 mA for 35 min [21-23]. After electrophore-\nsis, slides were neutralized with neutralization buffer (pH 7.5) and stained with ethidium bro-\nmide (20 ng\/ml) after which comet-forming activity was scored by epifluorescence using a Leitz\nDialux 20 EB microscope. Analyses for comet tail length (CTL; \uf06dm), % Tail DNA (% T DNA) and\nOlive tail moment (OTM) were performed using Comet IV software [23,24].

After a 24-h incu-\nbation to allow attachment, cells were than exposed to test agents (0.01 \uf06dg\/ml, 0.1 \uf06dg\/ml and 1.0\n\uf06dg\/ml), as indicated; an equal volume of DMSO was employed as vehicle control and B[a]P (1.0\n\uf06dM) as a positive control. Following a 24-h exposure, medium was replaced with fresh medium\nwithout treatment but containing 2 \uf06dg\/ml cytochalasin-B [17,25]. The dishes were incubated for\na further 24 h, whereupon cells were fixed with 70% EtOH and stained with 5% Giemsa. For each\ncell population examined, micronuclei in 1,000 binucleate MCF-7 cells, total number of micro-\nnuclei in 1,000 binucleate MCF-7 cells and the distribution of multiple micronuclei (\uf0a3 5) in\n1,000 binucleate MCF-7 cells was ascertained [17,25].\nAttenuated total reflection-Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy\nMCF-7 cells (1\/6th of a confluent T75 flask in 6 ml complete medium) were cultured in 60-mm\ntissue culture dishes for 24 h prior to being treated with test compounds (0.0001 \uf06dg\/ml, 0.01 \uf06dg\/\nml or 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml); DMSO was employed as a vehicle control [19]. After 24-h exposure, cells were\ndisaggregated with trypsin\/EDTA solution, fixed in 70% EtOH, and applied to Low-E Microscope\nslides whereupon the suspensions were allowed to air-dry. Samples were then stored in a desic-\ncated environment prior to analysis. IR spectra were acquired using a Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spec-\ntrometer with Helios ATR attachment that contained a diamond crystal (Bruker Optics, USA)\n[19]. Using a closed circuit television (CCTV) camera attached to the ATR crystal, ten random\nlocations were interrogated across the samples [18]. Spectra were collected in ATR mode (8 cm-1\nspectral resolution, co-added for 32 scans) and were converted into absorbance using Bruker\nOPUS software. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma Chemical Co., UK) was used to clean the ATR\ncrystal after analysis of each sample. Each time the crystal was cleaned, a new background reading\nwas taken before recommencing spectral analysis. Spectra were baseline corrected and normal-\nized to Amide I (\uf0bb 1650 cm-1) absorbance band using OPUS software [26]. IR spectra (900 cm-1\n\u2013 1800 cm-1) were analysed employing principal component analysis (PCA) using the Pirouette\nsoftware package (Infometrix, USA) [27]. In PCA, each spectrum becomes a single point or score,\nin n-dimensional space and using selected principal components (PCs) as coordinates, the data\nwas analysed for clustering when viewed in different directions. A 3-D scores plot on PCs selected\nto demonstrate best segregation of cell spectra from different treatment groups was obtained;\nderived loadings plots highlighted the wavenumbers contributing to variance [26,27].Page 5 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPMC Biophysics 2008, 1:3 http:\/\/www.physmathcentral.com\/1757-5036\/1\/3Results\nThe clonogenic assay\nThe effects of organotin(IV) derivatives on the colony-forming ability of MCF-7 cells were ascer-\ntained (Figure 1). With all the test agents examined, dose-related decreases in colony formation\nwere noted. Organotin(IV) derivatives of 3,4-methylenedioxy-6-nitrophenylpropenoic acid (L1)\nwere the tri-organotin carboxylates Bu3Sn(L1) and Ph3Sn(L1) which were 100% toxic at \uf0b3 1.0 \uf06dg\/\nml, the di-organotin Bu2Sn(L1)2 which was 100% toxic at \uf0b3 10.0 \uf06dg\/ml and the mono-organotin\ncarboxylate BuSnCl(L1) which was the least toxic in this series. The cytotoxicity of organotin(IV)\nderivatives of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylpropenoic acid (L2) also increased in a dose-related\nfashion. The tri-organotin carboxylates Ph3Sn(L2) was 100% toxic at \uf0b3 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml whereas the di-\norganotin Bu2Sn(L2)2 was only toxic at \uf0b3 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml. Dose-related increases in the toxicities of\norganotin(IV) derivatives of 2,3-methylenedioxybenzoic acid (L3) were also observed (Figure 1).\nFollowing 24-h exposure to di-organotin carboxylates Bu2Sn(L3)2 or Et2Sn(L3)2, 100% cytotox-\nicity was noted \uf0b3 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml whereas the mono-organotin BuSn(L3)3 was far less toxic. Surpris-\ningly, in this series the least cytotoxic test agent was Me3Sn(L3). Each class of organotin(IV)\nderivative exhibited cytotoxicity following 24-h exposure in MCF-7 cells. In general, tri-organo-\ntins were more toxic than di-organotins with mono-derivative exhibiting the least toxicity in this\nassay.\nMicronucleus-forming activity\nThe micronucleus-forming activities of organotin(IV) carboxylates was assessed at three concen-\ntrations (Figure 2). Following 24-h exposure to all test agents, elevations in levels of micronuclei\ninduced were observed. In the absence of cytotoxicity (Figure 1), micronucleus-forming activity\nwas dose-related. Test agents such as Bu3Sn(L1), Ph3Sn(L1) and Ph3SnCl(L1) were all micronu-\ncleus-forming at the lowest concentration of 0.01 \uf06dg\/ml, but higher concentrations were cytox-\noxic. With a number of test agents including Me2Sn(L1)2, Ph3Sn(L2), Et2Sn(L3)2, Bu2Sn(L1)2,\nMe2Sn(L2)2, Ph3Sn(L2), BuSn(L3)2 and Et2Sn(L3)2, a reversal in elevated micronucleus forma-\ntion induced by lower exposures was noted in the presence of higher cytotoxic concentrations\n(Figure 2). Only the relatively non-cytotoxic organotin(IV) carboxylates including BuSnCl(L1),\nEt2Sn(L2)2, Me2Sn(L2)2, Bu2Sn(L2)2 and Me3Sn(L3) exhibited micronucleus-forming activity\nthroughout the concentration range tested; the least micronucleus-forming derivative was\nBuSn(L3)3 (Figure 2). These results suggest that following 24-h exposure to \uf0b3 0.1 \uf06dg\/ml tri-orga-\nnotins [Bu3Sn(L1), Ph3Sn(L1) or Ph3Sn(L2)] except for Me3Sn(L3), cytotoxic effects were more\nimportant. Following exposure to di-organotins [Bu2Sn(L1)2, Et2Sn(L2)2, Bu2Sn(L3)2 or\nEt2Sn(L3)2] with the exception this time being Bu2Sn(L2)2, cytotoxicity was the more important\nendpoint with \uf0b3 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml. However, with the less cytotoxic mono-organotins [BuSnCl(L1)2 and\nBuSn(L3)3], elevated micronucleus formation was noted up to 10.0 \uf06dg\/ml. In general, micronu-\ncleus-forming activity was of the order of mono- > di- > tri-organotin.Page 6 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPMC Biophysics 2008, 1:3 http:\/\/www.physmathcentral.com\/1757-5036\/1\/3\nPage 7 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nEffects of organotin(IV) carboxylates on per cent survival in MCF-7 cellsFigure 1\nEffects of organotin(IV) carboxylates on per cent survival in MCF-7 cells.

Following treat-\nment with some organotin(IV) carboxylates [e.g., Bu3Sn (L1), Ph3Sn(L1), Ph3Sn(L2),\nBu2Sn(L3)2], it may be that comet formation is being replaced by cytoxicity at the 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml\nexposure level. However, in the presence of less toxic derivatives [e.g., BuSnCl(L1)2, Et2Sn(L2)2,\nMe3Sn(L3)], Figure 3 does point to evidence of dose-related increases in formation of DNA SSBs.\nAt all the concentrations tested, levels of DNA SSBs induced were not dissimilar to those observed\nfollowing treatment with the positive control. However, with the alkaline comet assay it was\nmore difficult to distinguish between the relative abilities of tri-organotin carboxylates, di-orga-\nnotin carboxylates or mono-organotin carboxylates to induce elevations in DNA SSBs.\nA biochemical-cell fingerprint\nThe effects of 24-h exposure of MCF-7 cells with 0.0001 \uf06dg\/ml Bu3Sn(L1) (a mono-organotin car-\nboxylate) (Figure 4), Ph3Sn(L2) (a di-organotin carboxylate) (Figure 5) or Me3Sn(L3) (a tri-orga-\nnotin carboxylate) (Figure 6) on the consequent IR spectrum of 70% EtOH-fixed cellular\nmaterial, compared to vehicle control are shown. To see effects induced by all the organotin(IV)\ncarboxylates tested at all exposures (0.0001 \uf06dg\/ml, 0.01 \uf06dg\/ml or 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml), see Additional file\n1. Following fixation, MCF-7 cells were applied to Low-E reflective glass slides and interrogated\nusing the \uf0bb 250 \uf06dm \u00d7 250 \uf06dm octagon-shaped sampling area employed in this study for ATR-FTIR\nspectroscopy [18]. An IR spectrum of cellular biochemistry was obtainable from such 70% EtOH-\nfixed cells [19]. In the biomolecular region (900 cm-1 \u2013 1800 cm-1), clear induced alterations in\nthe \"biochemical-cell fingerprint\" were associated with organotin-treated cells (Figures 4, 5, 6;\nsee Additional file 1). In this study, variability was noted in control spectra between 1400 cm-1\nand 1500 cm-1; however, in order to distinguish intra-class differences (i.e., vehicle control vs.\ntreatment) one needs to look at the direction of the PCs. The most marked differences were noted\nin the spectral region \uf0bb 1300 cm-1 \u2013 1500 cm-1; these would be associated with amide III absorp-\ntions (predominantly C-N stretching) with significant contributions from CH2 stretching vibra-\ntions of carbohydrate residues (\uf0bb 1280 cm-1 \u2013 1360 cm-1), but some of these wavenumbers would\nbe associated with intra-class as opposed to inter-class variance (Figures 4, 5, 6). However, in Fig-\nure 5 PC1 mostly excludes this aforementioned region as a contributor to variance but highlights\n1225 cm-1 (asymmetric phosphate), which consistently contributed to variance. Additionally, in\nsome cases [Bu2Sn(L1)2, Et2Sn(L2)2, Me2Sn(L2)2, BuSn(L3)3 and Me3Sn(L3)], glycogen (\uf0bb 1030\ncm-1) was observed as an important contributing factor. Of note was the fact that except for BuS-\nnCl(L1)2, separation of IR spectra derived from 0.0001 \uf06dg\/ml exposed and control MCF-7 cells\nwas readily achievable along PCs 1, 2 and 3 (see Additional file 1). This suggested that organo-\ntin(IV) carboxylates (tri-, di- or mono-derivatives) are capable of inducing profound biomolecu-\nlar alterations even at low concentrations.Page 11 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPMC Biophysics 2008, 1:3 http:\/\/www.physmathcentral.com\/1757-5036\/1\/3\nPage 12 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAverage IR spectra of MCF-7 cells with corresponding scores plots plotted on PCs 1, 2 and 3 and loadings plots fol-lowing 24-h exposure to 0.0001 \uf06dg Bu3Sn(L1)\/mlFigure \nAverage IR spectra of MCF-7 cells with corresponding scores plots plotted on PCs 1, 2 and 3 and loadings plots fol-\nlowing 24-h exposure to 0.0001 \uf06dg Bu3Sn(L1)\/ml.

Taking IR\nspectra derived from cellular material previously exposed to Bu2Sn(L1)2, it was notable to see\nthat one could cluster the dose-related effects of this test agent (Figure 7). A scores plot along PCs\n1, 2 and 3 was constructed and rotation allowed selection of the view that highlighted best seg-\nregation (i.e., vehicle control vs. 0.0001 \uf06dg\/ml vs. 0.01 \uf06dg\/ml vs. 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml organotin(IV) carbox-\nylate).

Subsequent PCs are\ntaken orthogonal to those previously chosen and describe the maximum of the remaining vari-\nance. Generally, only the first few PCs are required to describe most of the information contained\nin the original data set. Figure 7 strongly supports the notion that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy com-\nbined with multivariate analysis is a powerful new approach for identifying exposure effects in\ntarget cell populations.\nDiscussion\nThe acute effects of organotin(IV) compounds, used as biocides against a number of organisms,\nhave been extensively investigated [2]. Their mechanism of toxicity remains obscure. It is\nassumed that these compounds are capable of reacting with cell membranes leading to leakage,\naccelerating ion exchange processes, and inhibiting oxidative or photochemical phosphoryla-\ntion. Among RnSnX(4-n) compounds, the most toxic appear to be the R3SnX [2,28,29]. In this\nstudy, we set out to apply ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in order to ascertain whether IR spectra, in the\nbiomolecular range (900 cm-1 \u2013 1800 cm-1), derived from organotin-treated MCF-7 cells might\nexhibit molecular alterations compared to control cells following exposures to sub-cytotoxic and\nsub-genotoxic concentrations of test agent. Effects of a panel of mono-, di- or tri-organotin(IV)\ncarboxylates in MCF-7 cells were examined. Cytotoxicity was assessed in the clonogenic assay\nwhilst genotoxicity was determined using the CBMN and alkaline comet assays.\nIn the 0.01 \uf06dg\/ml to 10.0 \uf06dg\/ml concentration range, all the organotin(IV) carboxylates tested\ninduced clear dose-related increases in cytotoxicity (Figure 1). However, with six of the deriva-\ntives [BuSnCl(L1)2, Et2Sn(L2)2, Me2Sn(L2)2, BuSn(L3)3 and Me3Sn(L3)] >60% survival was still\nobserved following 24-h exposure to 10.0 \uf06dg\/ml. In line with these observations, we examined\nthe ability of the test agents to induce elevated levels of micronuclei or DNA SSBs (Figures 2 and\n3). Even at the lowest concentration of 0.01 \uf06dg\/ml, marked elevations in micronucleus formation\n[except for BuSn(L3)3] and significant (P < 0.0001) increases in DNA SSBs [except for\nBu2Sn(L3)2] were induced following either 24-h or 2-h exposures, respectively. At higher concen-\ntrations of test agent, apparent reversals in the induction of genotoxic effects were probably asso-\nciated with cytotoxicity. An example of this was the dose related effects of BuSnCl(L1)2; in the\nCBMN assay (Figure 2) and the alkaline comet assay there are elevations in genotoxicity with\nincreasing concentration up to 0.1 \uf06dg\/ml. However, at the higher 1.0 \uf06dg\/ml concentration there\nis an apparent falling off in the levels of micronucleus formation (Figure 2) or DNA SSBs (Table\n2). Although not as marked as with other organotin(IV) carboxylates, there is a measurable cyto-\ntoxic effect in MCF-7 cells associated with this concentration of test agent.\nOne might surmise that environmental effects of such agents might be a consequence of expo-\nsures an order-of-magnitude or more lower than those routinely used in short-term (geno)toxic-\nity assays. The requirement for an appropriate concentration range in order to detect measurable\neffects in such assays is a major limitation as it is then difficult to make meaningful extrapola-Page 16 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPMC Biophysics 2008, 1:3 http:\/\/www.physmathcentral.com\/1757-5036\/1\/3tions to lower but more environmentally-relevant concentrations. To this end, we applied ATR-\nFTIR spectroscopy to ascertain whether IR spectral changes might be identifiable in cells exposed\nto concentrations as low as 0.0001 \uf06dg\/ml (Figures 4, 5, 6). Following IR spectral interrogation of\ntreated vs. vehicle control cells, PCA was used to derive scores plots along PCs 1, 2 and 3. Except\nfor two of the test agents [BuSnCl(L1)2 and Bu2Sn(L2)2], marked separation of vehicle control vs.\ntreatment clusters was observed (see Additional file 1). In the loadings plots along the PCs used,\nthere was a consistency in the identification of peaks in the spectral region \uf0bb 1300 cm-1 \u2013 1500\ncm-1 as being the predominant contributors to variance segregating the clusters. These loadings\nwould be associated with amide III absorptions (predominantly C-N stretching) with significant\ncontributions from CH2 stretching vibrations of carbohydrate residues (\uf0bb 1280 cm-1 \u2013 1360 cm-\n1) (Figures 4, 5, 6). However, PC1 often seemed most responsible for inter-class variance and\npointed to wavenumbers primarily associated with DNA\/RNA conformational changes e.g., 1225\ncm-1. Identifying wavenumbers responsible for inter-class variance would be important as these\nmight give a signature of low-dose toxic effects associated with organotin(IV) carboxylates [19].\nDi-n-butyltin and tri-n-butyltin chloride are known to induce apoptosis in vitro in rat thymo-\ncytes [30,31]. The apoptotic pathway induced starts with an increased influx of Ca2+ ions and is\nfollowed by the release of the cytochrome c from mitocondria, activation of caspases and finally\nDNA fragmentation [31]. Diethyltindichloro(1,10-phenanthroline) inhibits cancer cell growth\nand also alters the surface of the cancer cell membrane [32,33]. The binding efficiency to DNA\nof organotin compounds depends on the coordination number and nature of groups bonded to\nthe central tin atom [32]. The phosphate group of the DNA sugar backbone usually acts as an\nanchoring site and often results in the stabilization of the tin centre as an octahedral stable spe-\ncies [32,33].\nOrganotin(IV) compounds may have applications in cancer chemotherapy [32,34-38].\nRecently, thirty interesting inorganic pharmaceuticals, four of which are tin compounds\n[32,33,39] have been described. If such agents have significant usage, it will be important to be\nable to identify measurable effects following low-level exposures to such potentially highly toxic\nderivatives.\nConclusion\nAscertaining the biological effects of environmental contaminants, especially if their cell or intra-\ncellular targets are unknown, remains a difficult challenge. Conventional cell-biology assays gen-\nerally measure a single end-effect (e.g., cytotoxicity, micronucleus formation or comet-forming\nactivity). Concentrations much higher than those generally found in the environment are usually\nrequired to induce such end-effects and one needs to extrapolate from such experimental set-\ntings. However, our study demonstrates that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy can be used to identify sig-\nnature biological effects at concentrations much lower than those required to induce cytotoxicityPage 17 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPMC Biophysics 2008, 1:3 http:\/\/www.physmathcentral.com\/1757-5036\/1\/3or genotoxicity. Application of this biophysical approach is a novel means of assessing risk asso-\nciated with environmental contaminants. Whether the induced IR spectral alterations observed\nare a signature of exposure to organotin(IV) carboxylates or a more general molecular alteration\nin response to environmental contaminants will be examined by comparing the biochemical-cell\nfingerprints of different classes of environmental contaminants.\nAdditional material\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported by \"Indigenous PhD scholarship 5000 Program\" and \"International Research Support\nInitiative Program\" of Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.
