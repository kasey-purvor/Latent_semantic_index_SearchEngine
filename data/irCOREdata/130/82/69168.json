Time-space, they have argued, is not a passive container of social \npractice or a mere backdrop against which social events play out. Rather, the timings and \nspacings of people and institutions have their own social effects (Lefebvre, 1991, Soja, \n1996). For some, these effects proceed from the ways in which the actual, physical \nlocation of objects and events encroaches upon the horizon of possible activities in which \nsocial agents can engage (Mills and Hamilton, 1994). For others however, the social \neffects of time and space are achieved not only by delimiting what is possible through the \nblunt constraints imposed by distance and delay, but also by influencing what is \nperceived, pursued and desired, through processes that suggest when and when not to \nrespond to a given social event (Elden, 2007, Hannah, 2000, Huxley, 2007). If social \nevents are particularly frequent or proximate, for example, this raises their perceived \nsalience and demands a response or reaction, whilst sporadic or distant social events are \nmore likely to be overlooked. Over time, this produces an ordering of social events in the \nmind of an individual. The spacing and timing of social life can, therefore, be seen to \nhave a psychological effect by amplifying or softening the visibility of social phenomena \n(Gregory, 2004, Said, 1979). \n \nThe recent increase in interest in mobility begs the question of how the mobilities agenda \nrelates to geographers\u2019 sensitivity to the presentational properties of time and space \n 3\n(Blunt, 2007). One contribution that geographers can make is to draw attention to the way \nthat mobility represents social reality in particular, subjective ways. This suggestion \nbuilds upon discussion of mobility by a range of academics (Hannam et al., 2006, Larsen \net al., 2006, Sheller and Urry, 2006). Mobility here is not treated as a social outcome but \nas a process of representation. Along with an interest in mobility per se, it is appropriate \nto develop an interest in the representative effects of mobility, drawing upon the lineage \nof work in geography that is attentive to the socially representative, suggestive effects of \ntimings and spacings (Elden, 2007, Gregory, 2004, Lefebvre, 1991, Soja, 1989). \n \nThe depiction of asylum seekers in the printed press has received widespread academic \ncriticism and been associated with a range of negative consequences for asylum seekers \nthemselves (Finney and Robinson, 2007, Kaye, 2001, Kessler, 2001, Mollard, 2001, \nSpeers, 2001, Thielemann, 2004, Boswell, 2003). In the particular context of the \ndetention of asylum seekers in the UK, Mallock and Stanley (2005) draw out the \nconnections between aggressive media reporting of asylum seekers and the use of \ndetention as a punitive system of immigrant disciplining in response to public fears \nsurrounding forced migrants. The media is not, moreover, the only way in which asylum \nseekers are depicted. Outside of popular media accounts of asylum seekers, a range of \nacademic studies have drawn attention to the subjective representation of asylum seekers \nin policy discourse (Schuster, 2003), institutional cultures (D\u00fcvell and Jordan, 2003), the \nlanguage used to describe asylum seekers and their situations (Turton, 2003) and activist \npromotional material (Malkki, 1996).  \n \n 4\nThe representation of foreigners in subjective ways has, from an historical perspective, \nbeen related to a deeper social unease about foreignness and an abiding association of the \nforeigner with disorder, chaos and threats to existing geo-political arrangements (Weber \nand Bowling, 2008). Such representations tend to be most marked in times of geo-\npolitical turmoil, when anxiety about the unknown is at its most pronounced. In this \nregard, the current epoch of globalisation shares with previous rounds of spatio-temporal \nglobal restructuring a tendency to single out suspect bodies and to contribute towards \ntheir separation through the disciplinary use of both mobility and controls over mobility \n(Weber and Bowling, 2008). As a case in point, the use of dispersal strategies in Britain, \nunder which asylum seekers are required to travel to far-flung areas of the country if they \nare to receive subsistence support from the state, creates an impression of an asylum \npopulation that is both copious, due to their geographical dispersion, and burdensome, \ndue to their routine location in areas of the country that offer cheap housing in precisely \nthose areas that can ill-afford to support vulnerable immigrants who are prohibited from \nfinding work and supporting themselves (Schuster, 2005). \n \nOne theme linking these studies is the effect that subjective representations and \ndepictions of asylum seekers have over ostensibly objective actors who have influence \nover the determination of asylum seekers\u2019 claims for asylum or their welfare during their \ntime in the UK. This paper argues that subjective depictions of asylum seekers exert a \nparticular type of power over these influential actors, which causes them to treat asylum \nseekers in different ways without forcing them or overtly incentivising them to do so. It is \n 5\nin this sense that it is appropriate to develop an interest in the governmental influences \nover asylum sector actors. \n \nGovernmental power is taken to mean influence over the dispositions of actors (Foucault, \n1991). As opposed to power that either appeals to an actor\u2019s interests, or over-rides their \ninterests, both of which treat these interests as exogenous, governmental power refers to \npower that re-casts interests, affecting the desires and aspirations of an actor and \nendogenising interests themselves into the realm of what is contestable and subject to \ndetermination by powerful factions (Lukes, 2005). This represents a significant move \naway from neo-classical models of agency which see individual interests as immutable. \nRather, the importance of what Rose and Miller call \u2018techniques\u2019 that are capable of \ninducing within subjects particular desires or aspirations is what is at stake in a \ngovernmental analysis (Rose and Miller, 1992). This link between psychological factors \nand governmental power has been emphasised in work concerned with the operation  of \n\u2018governmentality\u2019: the orchestration of conduct that is nevertheless volitional (Foucault, \n1991). \n \nDrawing upon thirteen interviews with activists and employees in and around \nCampsfield, this paper contends that the mobility of asylum seekers around the detention \nestate affects both groups, encouraging, although not forcing, them to treat the asylum \nseekers under their influence in ways that increase the chances of their eventual exclusion \nfrom the UK. Mobility can thereby by understood as a governmental technique that acts \nupon this ostensibly powerful population. \n 6\n Campsfield House in rural Oxfordshire is one of thirteen facilities that, together, \nconstitute the \u2018detention estate\u2019 of the UK with a total capacity of 2663 places, excluding \nfacilities to hold families (See Map One). \n 7\nMap One: The UK\u2019s Detention Estate \n \n 8\n  \nSource: adapted from capacity and postcode information given by National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns, \ncorrect 11th February 2009 (http:\/\/www.ncadc.org.uk\/about\/capacity.html). Excludes smaller, short term holding \nfacilities in Manchester, Harwich and Dover Harbour. Colnbrook and Kalyx are separate removal centres at very \nsimilar postcodes so are represented together here. \n \nOne of the most noticeable trends in asylum seekers\u2019 incarceration in recent years has \nbeen the extent to which asylum seekers are increasingly moved between detention \ncentres. In 2004\/5, the most recent financial year for which figures are available, the \nBritish state spent over \u00a36.5 million simply moving detainees from one secure facility to \nanother within the UK (author's calculations from Hansard, 5th December 2005, Hansard, \n9th January 2006). \n \nWhile the rationale for these movements and the implications that they hold for asylum \nseekers will be discussed, this paper will focus upon the effect this degree of forced \nmobility has on the ways charity workers, asylum activists and detention centre managers \nchoose to treat the asylum seekers under their influence. In focusing upon the \ngovernmental effect of the mobility of asylum seekers around the detention estate, the \nstudy addresses an area that has hitherto received relatively little attention. There has \nbeen a great deal of literature examining the implications of the government-orchestrated \nspatial and temporal organisation of asylum seekers for asylum seekers themselves \n(Chapman, 1999, Cornelius, 2005, Fekete, 2005, Thielemann, 2004, Van Hear, 2004). \nLess work, however, has considered the implications of the organised mobility of asylum \n 9\nseekers for those who manage them, make decisions about them, ensure their well-being, \nand advocate or demonstrate on their behalf. While it is clear that the movement of \nasylum seekers has consequences for asylum applicants in terms of disruption and \ninconvenience (and it is certainly not the intention to detract from these impositions here) \nless attention has been paid to the way in which this mobility has the secondary, ancillary \neffect of presenting asylum seekers as more transient and fleeting to those actors that \nhave an influence over their experiences. \n \nThe following section introduces Campsfield House, the system of intra-detention estate \nmovement is examined in Section Three and the governmental effect of this system are \nexamined in Sections Four and Five respectively. The paper concludes with a call to give \nspacings, timings and mobilities their proper places in the growing list of representative \ntechniques that underpin governmental power. \n \n \nCAMPSFIELD HOUSE IMMIGRATION REMOVAL CENTRE \n \nThe British practice of incarcerating immigrants has been in place since at least 1993, and \nhas increased in sophistication through the development of contracting business models \nwhereby private companies assume the day-to-day operation of an increasing proportion \nof the centres (see Bacon, 2005). This legacy of immigrant incarceration facilities, \ncoupled with the layers of private accountability to public bureaucracy that surround it, \nserves to normalise and routinise the incarceration of immigrants. In Sidaway\u2019s terms, \n 10\ndespite the prima facie unsettling characteristics of immigration detention, the practice \nhas become banal, with a focus more upon its operationalisation than upon its \njustification (Sidaway, 2003). It is precisely this banality that can reduce individuals \nwithin detention systems to mere numbers, positioning them in passive and vulnerable \nroles. This in turn opens the possibility to individuals becoming lost in carceral \nenvironments, constantly being moved so that their presence is always passing, fleeting \nand ghostly. Indeed, the possibility that the continual movement of detainees to reduce \ntheir visibility has become a government strategy, a process referred to as \u2018ghosting\u2019 \n(Wilson, 2008), has been raised in the light of apparent evidence of an international \nnetwork of unacknowledged detention centres run by the American government (so-\ncalled CIA \u2018black sites\u2019) (Amnesty International 2007). \n \n \nCampsfield House has the capacity to intern 198 detainees. The facility is located in a \nsecluded rural area, surrounded by fields on all sides. Access is provided by a long \nservice road through a wooded area that screens the facility from public view. Security is \nextremely tight (see Photograph One), including pervasive CCTV monitoring; thorough \nchecking and searching of all visitors and employees; guards patrolling the 12-foot high \nrazor-wire-topped perimeter fence; heightened observation of detainees perceived to pose \na risk of disturbance or self-harm; five steel security doors between the outside world and \nthe detainees; an isolation unit; a segregation unit and the sanctioned use of forceful \ncontrol and restraint procedures. \n 11\n Photograph 1: Campsfield House \nINSERT PHOTOGRAPH OF CAMPSFIELD HERE \nThe facility was converted from a youth detention centre in 1993. The composition of the \ndetainee population in Campsfield varies according to Home Office targets but the largest \nnational groups at the time of the Prison Inspection in 2002 were Albanian, Indian, \nJamaican and Yugoslav (HM Inspectorate of Prisons, 2002). \n \nAccess to the centre was secured through two strategies. First, rather than the usual \nstrategy of snowballing from the bottom to the top of an organization, some senior \nfigures were asked to participate in the research from the outset. This was because while \nlower ranked officials might be fearful of management reprisals if they discussed the \ncentre, senior figures had the authority to waive secrecy clauses. This strategy proved \nsuccessful, with three management level interviews secured at the centre. The second \nstrategy was to access the centre\u2019s administrative structure by snowballing from the \nasylum advocacy groups that operated around it, with which I already has some personal \ncontact. While it might be expected that asylum advocates and management staff at the \ncentre had an antagonistic relationship, and certainly this was true in some cases, in \ngeneral the relationship inside and outside of the removal centre was surprisingly \nsupportive. Both management and asylum advocates had as one of their goals the \nimprovement of conditions for detainees so, at least to some extent, co-operation suited \n 12\nboth parties. External charities would sometimes be invited into the centre to provide \nentertainment, advice or friendship to the detainees, which involved a degree of co-\nordination and the development of a necessary understanding between management and \npro-asylum groups. For this reason I was able to snowball within the organization from \nthe groups ostensible both outside it and opposed to it. The composition of the group of \nresearch participants reflects these strategies (Table One). \nTable One: Details of Sources and Participants  \nSource 1 Campaign to Close Campsfield Promotional Leaflet entitled \u2018Close \nCampsfield: Oxford\u2019s Own Crime Against Humanity\u2019 \nSource 2 Voluntary advisor to detainees who has worked in and around the centre for \nover five years. \nSource 3 Local pro-asylum activist. \nSource 4 Management level professional, Campsfield IRC. \nSource 5 Volunteer with Oxford-based asylum advocacy organization. \nSource 6 Email statement from management level professional, Campsfield IRC. \nSource 7 Email interview with managerial-level professional.

These \nfactors indicate the politically sensitive nature of the topic under discussion and the fact \nthat some of the contributors to the research were taken a degree of personal risk in order \nto participate. \n \n 14\nThe asylum seekers incarcerated in Campsfield and elsewhere in the detention estate are \nnot held under criminal law, but as the result of an administrative decision taken by \ncivilian immigration officials (Weber, 2003). They have not been charged with an \noffence, they are not awaiting trial and they do not know the length of their incarceration \n(Schuster, 2005). The centre is privately run on a government contract that is periodically \ntendered. The company in charge of the centre at the time of this research was Global \nSolutions Limited (GSL), who lost their contract to a lower bid from a competitor, Global \nEnterprise on Outsourcing (GEO), in the summer of 2006. The imperative to cut costs \nreflects the fact that the management of detention centres is an expensive business. In \nresponse to a parliamentary question in 2001, the cost of detention in the UK was stated \nto range from \u00a3364 per detainee per week to \u00a31620 (Hansard, 25th October 2001). \n \nThe rationale for removal centres is two-fold. First, the detainees represent those \nconsidered to be most likely to \u2018go underground\u2019 in an attempt to avoid deportation if \nthey are not incarcerated. The second rationale is that these asylum seekers\u2019 deportations \nare imminent. In theory, every asylum seeker in Campsfield has reached the end of the \nlegal asylum-claiming process and has received a negative final decision. In 2002 the \ncentre was renamed from a \u2018detention\u2019 centre to a \u2018removal\u2019 centre in order to reflect this \noperational objective. \n \nBoth rationales are debateable. When a Select Committee on Home Affairs examined the \npractice of detention during 2003 they expressed concern that \n 15\n Many of those labelled absconders are in fact people who, once their claims have been \nrejected and benefits withdrawn, have in the absence of any attempt to remove them \ndrifted elsewhere in search of work. \nFourth Report, Select Committee on Home Affairs, 2003, para. 66 \n \nOf the small number of academic studies carried out into the subject, Bruegel and \nNatamba (2002) used the records of Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), a registered \ncharity, to trace ninety-eight asylum detainees who were bailed between July 2000 and \nOctober 2001. They found that over 90% of those released kept their bail conditions \ndespite only 7% receiving a favourable final legal decision on their claim. This seemed to \nsuggest that nine out of ten participants were incarcerated unnecessarily. Similarly, in \ntracing asylum seekers granted temporary admission, Weber and Gelsthorpe (2000) \nfound that, for the ports covered in their research, absconding rates varied between 3% \nand 12%, again indicating a high degree of inefficiency because as many as 97% of \nasylum seekers due for deportation did not abscond. According to Bacon (2005: 5), citing \na report by Dunston (1994), \n \nA rare acknowledgement of the low rate of absconding among asylum seekers was made \nby the Home Office Minister in 1995, who informed parliament that of the 37,120 \npersons who were refused asylum in the three-year period 1992-94, only 220 were \nknown to have absconded, the equivalent of 0.59 per cent. \n 16\n The second rationale for the incarceration of asylum seekers is that they are awaiting \nimmediate deportation. This did not tally, however, with the accounts of activists in and \naround the centre. For example, one activist promotional leaflet (Source 1) claimed that \n\u2018Less than half of those detained are liable to removal or deportation; many, if not most, \nawait an initial decision on their asylum application\u2019. This was corroborated by my own \ninterviewees: \n \nNG:  How many asylum seekers are still appealing or still have legal issues? \nSource 3:  They shouldn\u2019t have if they are in a removal centre but they do have because \nthe Home Office will remove people before they\u2019ve come to the end of their appeal. That will \nhappen time and time again. \n \n \nEven the staff at the centre concede that a number of asylum seekers come to the centre \ndirectly upon reaching the UK. This indicates that asylum seekers\u2019 claims are, in some \ncases, entirely determined during their incarceration. Given that, in principle, they are not \nliable for deportation before their case is determined, this indicates that some of the \nasylum seekers incarcerated are not, in fact, \u2018awaiting deportation\u2019 at all. In response to \nthe question \u2018Do you get quite a few that come straight here?\u2019 one manger remarked: \n \n 17\nSource 4: We do get them, yeah, a fair few. People have been in detention for months \nbut say \u201cI\u2019ve never seen England\u201d. We bring them some pictures of it and so they might \nhave been here for four or five months and have no idea what it\u2019s like. \n \nIn general, there is acknowledgement among both staff and asylum advocates that \nCampsfield is holding asylum seekers whose legal claims for asylum are still being \nconsidered, contrary to the objectives of a \u2018removal\u2019 centre. It is also worth noting the \ngovernmental effect that this labeling can have. Detainees who are confronted by the fact \nthat they are in a removal centre may become profoundly disheartened at the apparent \ndismissal of their claims before they have actually been processed. As one activist \noutlined: \nSource 2: There are still many, many people in Campsfield who either haven\u2019t had even \nan initial refusal or have ongoing cases. You know, lots of people get let out and end up \ngetting refugee status. It comes as a huge shock to people to find themselves locked \nup when they hope they\u2019ve found a place of safety and it must be particularly awful to \nget to this place when it\u2019s called a \u2018Removal Centre\u2019 when they\u2019ve just arrived. \n \nThe labeling of the centre can act to undermine the motivation of asylum seekers held \nwithin it in pursuing their cases. To the extent that such effects are not forceful or \ncoercive, but nevertheless act upon the dispositions and motivations of detained subjects \n(Rose and Miller, 1992), the relabeling of the centre can be seen to have important \ngovernmental implications. \n \n 18\nThere is, unsurprisingly, a deep sense of injustice running throughout Campsfield. \nManagement has consequently faced considerable resistance from outside, and within, \nthe centre. From outside, the asylum advocacy community that operates around \nCampsfield includes BID, who attempt to facilitate bail for the detainees; Asylum \nWelcome, a charity that organises visits to the centre; Oxford University\u2019s Student \nAction for Refugees (STAR) who provide periodic workshops for detainees; and the \nCampaign to Close Campsfield, the most overtly political advocacy group that has \nregular contact with the Centre in the form of noisy, monthly demonstrations at its gates. \n \nFrom inside, Campsfield\u2019s detainees have a long history of protest and resistance. As \nearly as 1994 Algerian detainees went on hunger strike in response to their treatment, \nmounting rooftop protests, flying home-made banners and starting fires (Campaign to \nClose Campsfield, 2007). In 1997 fifty to sixty detainees escaped into a courtyard and \nprotested loudly in response to the harsh treatment of their fellow inmates. Nine of these \nprotesters were brought to trial as a result, yet embarrassingly for the then-management, a \npublic enquiry ruled that the charges against them were without foundation (Hayter, \n2004). Since then, Campsfield has been the site of hunger strikes, more rooftop protests, a \ncatalogue of public appeals from within the centre and repeated self-harm and suicide \nattempts. In June 2008 seven escapees evaded capture over-night in the local area (BBC \nNews Online, 2008). \n \n 19\nIn response to the difficulty of subduing the Campsfield inmates, the centre employs a \nrange of innovations. The use of force is sanctioned as a way to control or deter particular \nbehaviours, despite difficulties in regulating its use (MFCVT, 2004). Subtler mechanisms \nof control include a range of rewards and sanctions to promote compliant behaviour \nwithout the need to resort to force. Sanctions include, for example, isolation and \nsegregation or the withdrawal of privileges such as library access, gym access and the \npurchasing of luxury items. \u2018Rewards\u2019 include five pounds a week for detainees who \nkeep their rooms tidy. \n \nIt is policies such as these that can propagate an image of detainees as child-like and \ndependent. The operation of sanction and reward mechanisms positions the detainees as \nsubjects that can be legitimately disciplined, and centre employees themselves as \npaternalistic, which can have its own consequences in fostering a condescending view of \ndetainees among the management staff. In this sense, the treatment of detainees as \ndisciplined and sanctioned subjects acts to alter the dispositions of the staff towards \nthem, thereby constituting a governmental impact of the sanction and reward \nmechanisms. As one interviewee outlined: \n \nSource 14: I\u2019ve seen some staff being quite friendly and quite nice to the detainees \nbut often, well, I find their way of being friendly a bit patronizing. For instance when \nwe went and did [a workshop with the detainees] they would come and talk to us \nafterwards and tell us how good it was we kind of came there and let [the detainees] \n 20\ndo some things. I can\u2019t really explain it but just \u2026 kind of the way you\u2019d make kids do \nsomething creative and good for them. I mean, they were being friendly but it was \nvery clear that they were working above these people. \n \n \nINTRA-DETENTION ESTATE MOVEMENT OF DETAINEES \n \nPerhaps the most striking aspect of the reward and sanction system to be introduced has \nbeen the movement of detainees around the various detention facilities of the UK. \nAlthough studies of prisoner mobility are scarce, Svensson and Svensson (2006) have \nanalysed the social consequences of the increasing mobility of Swedish inmates. They \nargue that the act of mobility is at once humiliating and dehumanising to those who are \nmoved. By moving prisoners the authority of the mover is performed and enacted and the \nidentity of the inmate as a subjugated body is reinforced. They also recognise the value of \nmoving prisoners within a prison estate in terms of subduing prison populations and \nbreaking cultural ties. \n \n[P]risoner transportation is an important part of the dynamics of the prison system. This \nis an obvious example of the distinctive nature of the role played by culture in neo-liberal \nforms of governance. Transferring prisoners is being used to maintain differentiation and \nsecurity and to break the cultural rules and rituals that are establishing among the \nprisoner population. \n \n 21\nSvensson and Svensson, 2006, p2 \n \nAccording to a series of HM Prison inspections of Campsfield House (HM Inspectorate \nof Prisons 2002; 2004; 2007; 2008), the movement of detainees within the removal \ncentres of the UK have caused concern not only as they are carried out, but also through \nthe threat or possibility of movement in the minds of detainees. It appears from the \nemphasis placed in these reports upon the importance of preparing detainees to be \nreleased or transferred, which is seen as an important part of making them feel secure, \nthat the process of movement and the anticipation of movement is very often profoundly \nstressful for detainees. That the practice of moving immigration detainees is becoming \nmore common should therefore alert us to an emerging source of anxiety and confusion \namong detained asylum seeker populations in the UK. \n \nThe Detention Escorting and Population Management Unit (DEPMU) is a central \ngovernment agency that is responsible for placing immigration detainees in suitable \nholding facilities (Prison Service, 2008, sections 5.1 - 5.4). They have been under \nparticular scrutiny since the mishandling of 1,023 foreign criminals in April 2006, who \nwere released rather than considered for deportation following completion of their prison \nsentences (BBC News Online, 2006). They have received criticism from HM \nInspectorate of Prisons for giving late notification of movements to detainees who are \ndue to be moved, causing alarm among detainees (HM Inspectorate of Prisons, 2006, \nsection 2.14). \n 22\n DEPMU are a key organisation because they arrange the transfer of detainees. While \nother, private companies are paid to do the actual work of transferring them DEPMU \nhave the authority to \u2018arrange for a detainee to be moved in order to meet local demands \nor to provide more secure accommodation\u2019 (Immigration and Nationality Directorate, \n2001a, section 38.10). At Campsfield, staff are able to request the movement of detainees \nto alternative centers via communication with the centre manager in the first instance, \nand, with the centre manager\u2019s authorisation, via DEPMU. These movements are not for \nthe purposes of deportation but simply to transfer detainees between incarceration \nfacilities (Hayter, 2004). Troublesome detainees are more likely to be transferred. \n \nSource 12: If someone has raised complaints or has perhaps mobilised fellow detainees \nto put together a petition or something often you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re moved around, split \nup in some way and those who seem to be particularly vociferous seem to end up in \nsome of the more secure centres. \n \nThe extent of these movements has become a striking feature of the centre at Campsfield. \nWhile it is difficult to access official statistics concerning the number of asylum seeker \nmovements via DEPMU, Tony McNulty, the then-minister for immigration, did respond \nto a parliamentary question about the number of intra-detention estate transfers, posed in \n2006. His response was as follows: \n 23\n The figures for the number of inter-detention estate transfers of immigration detainees \nin 1997\u201398 are not available. In 2001\u201302, there were 30,334 such transfers, in 2002\u2013\n03, 35,656; in 2003\u201304, 41,477 and in 2004\u201305, 54,670 \u2026 These statistics cover all \ninter-detention movements of detainees including those from prisons, police cells and \nport holding rooms into Immigration Removal Centres. \nTony McNulty MP (Hansard, 9th January 2006) \n \nConsidering that the capacity of the detention estate is only just over 2500, these figures \nconvey the fluency and constancy of detainee mobility. As a result, the average length of \nstay of detainees in Campsfield is reducing. \n \nSource 3: They\u2019ve initiated a totally different regime which is that they don\u2019t want to \nleave any detainees anywhere for any length of time. There are a few detainees in \nCampsfield that have been in there for a long time, but very few. They will come in and \nthey will stay for 10 days and they will be moved to Harmondsworth or to Yarlswood or \nanywhere but it\u2019s a moving process. The average stay at Campsfield now is 10 days. \n \nThis means that individual asylum seekers often experience a variety of detention \nfacilities. \n \n 24\nSource 8:  Before Campsfield House I stay long time I stay here for four detentions. \nNG:  Four different detentions? \nSource 8: Four different detentions. My first detention is Oakington. Oakington I stay here \nthree days for Oakington. \nNG:  Yes \nSource 8: Four months five day in Harmondsworth \nNG:  Harmondsworth yes \nSource 8: After Harmondsworth [name] bring me to Belmarsh prison \nNG:  Belmarsh \nSource 8: Belmarsh I stay maybe one month. After Belmarsh I think I stay in Dover. Dover \ndetention two months four days. After Dover I go again to Harmondsworth one week. \nNG:  Yes \nSource 8: After Harmondsworth I come [name] bring me to Campsfield House \nNG:  Yeah so your total? \nSource 8: Maybe the total\u2019s fifteen months in detention. \n \nThe average price of moving a detainee from one location to another in 2005 was \n\u00a3119.50 (Hansard, 5th December 2005), meaning that the government spent over \u00a36.5m \nin 2004\/5 moving detainees around the detention estate. Moreover, the movements also \nentail significant secondary costs. One of my interviewees was responsible for organising \nclasses for the detainees. \n \nSource 4: For a class, it\u2019s impossible to get any sort of cohesion and move along as a \ngroup and make any sort of progress because you might start with 10 people in your \n 25\ngroup on a Monday and still have 10 at the end of the week but they\u2019re completely \ndifferent people - the turnover\u2019s so high. \n \nFurthermore, there are detailed checking-in procedures for new detainees, including \nheightened observation, medical screening and a reception wing for the first forty-eight \nhours of stay, all of which experience increased demand due to the transfer of detainees. \n \nSource 4: The centre manager\u2019s actually complained about it because it\u2019s very costly \nand it\u2019s very time consuming. The facilities here, they were designed as a detention \ncentre to have a much lower throughput. Now it\u2019s a higher throughput, they\u2019re having \nto deal with many, many more people every day checking them in and out. \n \nNevertheless, despite their cost, the movements appear to be an effective part of the \nsanction and reward system. For the Campsfield detainees, moving to another centre is an \nunwelcome prospect because the conditions in Campsfield are widely regarded as \nrelatively good. Detainees are allowed free association during most of the day, meaning \nthat they can leave their rooms and move freely around the centre. There are also good \nrecreational facilities and generally friendly relationships with staff. Other centers are not \nso accommodating. Some offer much poorer facilities, premises that were originally \ndesigned as prisons and detention custody officers who treat the detainees much more \nimpersonally (Source 5). A former Campsfield detainees described how detainees would \noften be grateful to return to Campsfield. \n 26\n NG:  What did people think about that when they came back? \nSource 9: People is very, very content. Is OK. Maybe people is enjoy. Because I told you \nagain - Campsfield House is better detention. \n \nA governmentality-based analysis of detainee mobility focuses upon changes in the \ndesires of the actors involved as a result of the movements. Source 9 provides a striking \nexample of these effects. Through the selective differentiation of conditions within \ndifferent removal centres, Source 9 has actually been induced to desire to be held within \nCampsfield. By making reference to the contentment he and other detainees felt upon \narrival at Camspfield, the extent of the governmental influence of the mobility of \ndetainees is thrown into relief. \n \nTHE EFFECT OF DETAINEE MOBILITY UPON ASYLUM ADVOCATES \n \nIt is certainly not the intention here to detract from the consequences that intra-detention \nestate movement holds for asylum seekers. They find the continual upheaval \ndisorientating and dehumanising, as links to networks of fellow detainees, external \nsupporters and even external lawyers and other sources of formal security are continually \nsevered (Hayter, 2004). Nevertheless, with the objective of understanding why asylum \nsector activists and employees conduct themselves in the ways that they do, the aspect of \nintra-detention estate movement that concerns this paper is that which impacts upon these \ninfluential figures. \n 27\n Alongside the effects on the detainees themselves, the movement of asylum seekers \naround the detention estate both delimits the work that asylum advocacy organisations \nare able to do on behalf of the asylum seekers and undermines the basis of their \nmotivation to carry out work on asylum seekers\u2019 behalf.  These two effects correspond, \nrespectively, to the blunt effects of timing and spacing outlined in the introduction and \nthe governmental aspect of mobility, that works upon desires, aspirations and \u2018interests\u2019. \nIn the first instance, the legal support that the asylum advocacy community was able to \ndeliver was impoverished as a result of the mobility of detainees. Legal advisers such as \nBID, as well as local lawyers, did not have the time to familiarise themselves with \nasylum seekers\u2019 cases before they were moved. At the time of my research, BID \nvolunteers were concentrating on creating self-help notebooks in a wide variety of \nlanguages that asylum seekers could take with them when they moved: \n \nSource 11: We have so many clients now we can\u2019t possibly do even a small fraction of \nthem. So BID has devised a system, we call it the notebooks, which explains to people \nthe process of bail and how they can run their own bail hearing, how to list for it in the \ncourt, the timescale and we actually help them make the arguments for themselves. The \nidea is that they take these with them wherever they end up. \n \nIdeally, BID would make the applications for bail themselves but given the potentially \nlimited duration of their interactions with each client, they have had to devise second-best \nalternatives. The \u2018notebook\u2019 solution is a direct response to the mobility of asylum \n 28\nseekers that delivers the responsibility for making a bail application back to individual \ndetainees, who may be ill-equipped to formulate the sort of legal arguments that \nstrengthen applications. \n \nWhile it is clearly the case that the mobility of detainees has a blunt, direct impact upon \nthe efficacy of asylum advocacy groups in terms of what they are able to achieve, the \nmovement of detainees also undermines the motivation of these organisations, impacting \nnot only upon what they can and cannot achieve, but upon what they want and do not \nwant to achieve. In the case of the governmental impact of mobility, the difficulty of \nestablishing a relationship with detainees had the specific effect of constricting the \ndegree to which the advocacy community could secure bail. To achieve bail, an asylum \nseeker must be sponsored by two external guarantors, who are each required to put down \nfinancial deposits, so called \u2018sureties\u2019, that they will lose if the asylum seeker absconds. \nAdditionally, they must be able to provide an address that they will stay at should they be \ngranted bail. \n \nSource 11: Unless you\u2019ve got accommodation to go to and at least one surety you\u2019re \nvery unlikely to get bail. \n \nIt is often the case that the amount of deposit required to secure bail tests the degree of \ntrust between the depositor, who is often simply a sympathetic member of the public. \n 29\nAlthough deposits are usually in the region of a few hundred pounds, they have been as \nhigh as two thousand pounds, at the discretion of the bail tribunal. \n \nSource 2: Sureties vary a lot \u2026 Sometimes there are horrible situations where you go \nto court and the adjudicator tries to up the amount they offer in court in front of the \ndetainees which is very hard on sureties. It used to, and probably still is, quite common \nto demand two sureties of \u00a32,000 each. \n \nThe strategy of demanding sureties puts pressure not only upon the actual ability of \nadvocacy organisations to support detainees, but also their willingness to do so, \nproviding one example of the way in which factors that undermine trust and reciprocity, \nsuch as intra-detention estate movement, can affect advocates\u2019 behaviour. \n \nThe requirement for bail applicants to be able to provide an address that they will stay at \nshould they be released further illustrates the stress that is put upon relationships between \nadvocacy groups and detainees by the latter\u2019s constant movement. To secure bail \ndetainees must show they have somewhere to reside during the period of their bail term. \nProviders of accommodation were often either private individuals or civil society \norganisations such as churches and convents. One priest described the way in which \nsome asylum seekers who are frequently moved, both within and outside the detention \nestate under the UK\u2019s dispersal program, can become detached from communities of \n 30\nsupport, making them targets for future transfers because no-one would be in a position \nto try to trace them or stop them being moved again. \n \nSource 13: They should stop moving them around the country, which they do.  The \nnumber of times I\u2019ve had to write panic letters saying you know you cannot move \nthis person to the other end of the country because it destabilises them in terms of \ntheir mental health\u2026 \n \nNG: What reasons do they give for the movements? \n \nSource 13: They can be totally gratuitous. They have to go somewhere. Sometimes \nit\u2019s totally gratuitous, there is no reason. \n \nNG: And when you\u2019ve written how have they responded to that? \n \nSource 13: Well actually almost every time I\u2019ve managed to stop the move. \n \nNG: Right, with a letter. \n \nSource 13: Yes.  But if people don\u2019t have a community they\u2019re attached to who \nactually cares about them as an individual then they\u2019re just going to be moved \nbecause they will have no-one to speak on their behalf. \n \nIt is reasonable to expect the willingness of civil society organisations to accommodate \nasylum seekers to vary in proportion to their familiarity with those wanting to be housed. \n 31\nMoving detainees regularly therefore directly undermines the basis of their goodwill, \nwith important ramifications for transferred detainees. \n \nThe likelihood of forming meaningful relationships with detainees who are constantly \nmoved is further reduced by the difficulty of visiting them. Although there are dedicated \nfacilities to allow visitors and detainees to meet and interact within Campsfield, the \nprocess of visiting is difficult because visitors have to navigate demanding organisational \nprocedures and undergo extensive security checks. Detainees must be known to the \nvisitors before they receive a visit; appointments with named detainees must be booked \ntwenty-four hours in advance. The constant movement of detainees means that visitors \nmust navigate these organisational requirements on behalf of someone that they do not \nknow and have not met before with increasing regularity. \n \nSource 5: It\u2019s quite difficult to visit people, you have to book in advance you can\u2019t \njust turn up. You have to have a named person and visiting is allowed from 2.00 till \n5.00 every afternoon and from 6.00 till 9.00 every evening. When you go in they check \nagainst your booking your name and who you\u2019re visiting and you then have your \nphotograph taken. Anything on you you have to leave in a locker except for like I \nalways take in a notebook and pen, I usually take my diary for various reasons, phone \nnumbers and things. I\u2019ve had my diary removed from me though because it had a map \nof the underground in it. They don\u2019t let you take your driving license in if it\u2019s got a \npicture on it. \nNG:  Why? \n 32\nSource 5: Goodness knows. And then you get searched. You have to stand, take \nyour coat off front and back. Only 10 people can be visited at one time. But I\u2019ve often \nbeen when it hasn\u2019t been at all well used. \n \nThis account tallies with criticism levied at the centre by HM Inspectorate of \nPrisons for employing a range of intrusive security measures: \n \n[T]he number of security measures taken for domestic visitors was \ndisproportionate. These involved having a photograph taken, a biometric finger \nprint check, an identifying arm band, completing a written form, producing \nphotographic identification, a pat down search and an x-ray of property. \n \nHM Inspectorate of Prisons, 2007, p14 \n \nGiven the strict regulation of visits enthusiasm for visiting detainees declines in the face \nof their constant movement. Even detainees with a number of supporters in one part of \nthe country may be completely unknown at their new location: \n \nSource 14: Here in Campsfield a lot of the detainees will have people supporting them \noutside. They\u2019ll have people in BID or Asylum Welcome or just friends or family that are \nhelping them and obviously moving them to different detention centres disrupts all of \nthat. No-one knows you\u2019re there and there\u2019s no-one you can get in touch with. \n \n 33\nThis has prompted some of the asylum activists at Campsfield to try to trace detainees \nmoved to a different centre. Describing this process, one activist outlined both the \ndifficulty of doing this through the official channels and the consequent reliance upon the \ngoodwill of individuals within detention estate. \n \nSource 5: We ring Campsfield to speak to a client who was maybe there yesterday \ntalking to us and they say \u2018oh they\u2019ve gone\u2019. So we say \u2018well have they been removed \n[i.e. deported] or have they just moved [i.e. transferred within the detention estate]?\u2019 \n\u2026 Sometimes they won\u2019t even tell you whether or not they\u2019ve been deported. So we \nhave to then trail through the immigration service route and they won\u2019t answer \nanything on the phone, you have to fax. \n \nTracing asylum seekers is important because it allows detainee support groups to co-\nordinate their efforts across the country and may go some way to alleviating the \nalienation of asylum seekers. The barriers to tracing detainees are therefore significant, \nmeaning not only that supportive communities are lost to the detainees, but also that \ncontact with detainees is denied to supporters. In these ways, the movement of detainees \ndisturbs the relationship between them and their support networks, which are often a \nprerequisite for motivated support. To the extent that supporters\u2019 dispositions towards \ndetainees are to some degree determined by their contact with them, any factors that \ncurtail this contact, including movement, can be seen to have the governmental effect of \neroding supporters\u2019 willingness to persevere with their support. \n \n 34\nTHE EFFECTS OF MOBILITY UPON CENTRE STAFF \n \nThe governmental effects of detainee movements are not confined to the activist sector. \nThe management team at Campsfield includes roughly ten individuals who each have \nresponsibility for one aspect of the detainees\u2019 welfare during their stay. Although they are \na powerful and influential group, they are also subject to the governmental power that is \nexerted over them through the representation of the detainee population in their care. This \nis not to suggest that, in the absence of detainee movement, managers would consistently \nchoose to help the detainees: the research gave evidence of a mixture of attitudes towards \ndetainees among the management at Campsfield. Whatever goodwill does exist towards \ndetainees, though, is systematically undermined by the continual mobility of asylum \nseekers. \n \nThere are minimum standards of behaviour that are expected of all staff within \nCampsfield. The Detention Centre Rules (Immigration and Nationality Directorate, \n2001b) set out what is expected of detention centre officers, with emphasis placed upon \ntheir roles in protecting the well-being of detainees, maintaining vigilance about their \nphysical and mental health, and encouraging their self-respect. Significantly, the rules \nalso include objectives that custody officers should pursue that are measurable precisely \nin the dispositions of detainees themselves. Just as the good fathers that Foucault (1991) \ndescribes who possess the ability to imbue their children with the desire to conduct \nthemselves in ways that the father deems appropriate, so detention custody officers are \ncharged with the responsibilities to enlist the \u2018willing co-operation\u2019 of detainees under \n 35\ntheir authority (Detention Centre rules, Immigration and nationality Directorate 2001b, \nclause 45.5), and \u2018encourage \u2026 a sense of personal responsibility\u2019 (Ibid., clause 45.6). In \nthis way custody officers within the detention estate are enlisted in the governmental \nproject of eliciting the consent and co-operation of detainees. \n \nAs with any system as complex and politically contentious as the detention estate, the \nenforcement of the minimum requirements set out in the detention centre rules is \nchallenging. To this end, HM Inspectorate of Prisons serves an important function as the \nprimary means of accountability of the centre, and many of the pro-asylum seeker \nactivists I came into contact with during this research were highly supportive of the \nInspectorate\u2019s work. Recent inspections of Campsfield House have been both announced \nand unannounced. There are, however, at least three difficulties with HM Inspectorate of \nPrisons\u2019 work regarding Removal Centres. \n \nFirst, the name of the Inspectorate is unfortunate. Associating inspections directly with \nthe prison service undermines efforts among removal centre staff to distinguish between \nremoval centres and prisons. Second, some of my interviewees questioned the degree of \ninfluence the Inspectorate had. On the one hand, their remit was seen as relatively tight: \n \nSource 11: Their reports address four issues \u2013 detainees\u2019 safety, the respect they \nreceived inside detention, the provision of purposeful activity for them, and \nadequate preparation for release or transfer. That\u2019s four issues which leaves a great \nbig space around them. I mean I quite understand when you have to structure what \nyou\u2019re doing but there are a lot of unanswered things. \n \n 36\nOn the other hand, individual removal centres are not bound by the recommendations of \nthe Inspectorate: \n \nSource 6: Unfortunately they can only make recommendations and most of those \nare ignored by [the contracting company in charge of Campsfield at the time the \nstatement was written]. As one officer said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do what HMIP [Her \nMajesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons] says! \n \nA third difficulty with the Inspectorate system is the fact that their visits are infrequent. \nAt Campsfield they occur roughly once every two years. A more regular form of \nmonitoring is also provided by the \u2018Independent Monitoring Board\u2019, also known as the \n\u2018Visiting Committee\u2019. This is an independent organisation composed of volunteer \nworkers who have been trained explicitly for the role of up-holding standards of care and \ndecency within prison and immigration removal establishments across the UK. Although \nthe Campsfield monitoring board did not contribute to this research, they have produced \nannual reports detailing the financial, legal, infrastructural, social and security-related \nstatus of the centre for a number of years (see www.imb.gov.uk). Despite the obvious \nimportance of their role, however, this organisation was criticised by my interviewees. \nFirst, my interviewees suggested that they were unaware of the practice of detaining \nimmigrants whose cases had not come to an end: \n \nSource 2: A lot of people including the official visitors group, the so-called \nindependent monitoring group, seem to think that the people who are there are either \nillegal immigrants or failed asylum seekers - people who are imminently going to be \nremoved. I mean I don\u2019t know what the exact proportions are but I\u2019m sure that there \n 37\nalways have been people in Campsfield who\u2019ve been picked up at the airport so \nthey\u2019re not technically illegal. \n \nSecond, the group had caused consternation among some of the management at the centre \nbecause they had apparently not interviewed detainees thoroughly enough: \n \nSource 6: They are not competent and very ineffectual. They do not manage \nto protect human rights in the centre. Don\u2019t talk to people about the right \nissues. Not on detainees wavelength. One can learn more by visiting and \ntalking to a few detainees. \n \nGiven the apparent flaws in the monitoring of places such as Campsfield, there is scope \nfor individual members of staff to make life difficult or easy for the detainees in a number \nof ways. This point was illustrated to me most effectively through some of the challenges \nI experienced in accessing detainees of Campsfield. During this research, although a \nnumber of interviews were conducted at the centre itself, these were with centre \nmanagers and not detainees. It was strictly prohibited to record any conversation with the \nasylum seekers themselves. \n \nDue to the fact that the detainee population was exceptionally difficult to access, focus \nwas concentrated upon gaining access to former detainees. It was this strategy that \nrevealed the power and discretion wielded by the management. Two former Campsfield \ndetainees were interviewed (Sources 8 and 9). Both of them owed their release \n 38\nexclusively to the support of a member of the management team at the centre. In one \ncase, a very young detainee had been bewildered and confused during his incarceration, \nand one of the management had befriended him and taken up his case out of kindness. In \nanother case, a detainee had attracted the attention of a manager who had decided to \n\u2018stick his neck out\u2019 in order to get the detainee released due to the respect he had for the \ndetainee. Although these were clearly neither equitable nor regulated forms of \nintervention, the release of these two former detainees demonstrates the influence of \nCampsfield\u2019s management, appearing to command a significant degree of influence over \nindividual asylum seekers\u2019 fortunes.  \n \nThe ability of staff to determine the experiences of individual detainees to such an extent \nprompted further enquires into their authority. According to a number of interviewees, \nmanagement level staff in Campsfield have in the past used their discretion to support \nlegal appeals, re-open legal cases, accompany asylum seekers to court, support bail \napplications, act as character references, prepare legal arguments, translate legal \ndocuments, secure good legal representation, deter poor or unscrupulous legal \nrepresentation, allow transferred asylum seekers to be traced by friends and supporters \nand block the transfer of detained asylum seekers (Sources 4 and 6). One manager \nunderscoring the discretion staff command: \n \nSource 7: We have been able to arrange for luggage to be collected, arranged new \nlawyers, medical appointments, phone cards, money for some being deported, \n 39\nclothes. We have provided for festivities and have a supply of Bibles, Q\u2019urans and \nother faith literature to give away. We have contacted detainees\u2019 families, and have \nput those being sent to NASS accommodation addresses of churches or refugee \nsupport groups where they can get help and advice. We have contacted \norganisations such as Jesuit Refugee Service about those being deported so that \nthey have some support on their return. \n \nGiven the degree of influence wielded by management, the way in which detainees are \npresented to managers is of critical importance. Members of the centre\u2019s management \nteam need personal relationships with the detainees in order to provoke them into using \ntheir considerable discretion to provide support because this discretion often entails \npersonal costs to them in terms of time, emotional investment and, sometimes, risk. The \nmovement of detainees undermines their opportunity to forge meaningful attachments \nand support the asylum seekers they come into contact with. \n \nOne of the centre managers interviewed (Source 4), for example, detailed the ways in \nwhich he used to be able to help the detainees under his authority but was less inclined to \ndo so since the heightening of detainees\u2019 mobility. I asked him whether he ever \ndeveloped an emotional attachment to the detainees: \n \nSource 4: It\u2019s less difficult now because the turnover\u2019s so high. In the past someone \nwould leave and you\u2019d wonder \u2018what happened to him?\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t heard from him for \nmonths, I wonder if he\u2019s still alive?\u2019 But now the turnover is so high that the minute \n 40\nsomeone\u2019s left there\u2019s someone who\u2019s arrived with just as big problems or just such \nnasty situations so there\u2019s always someone else to help. Nasty as it sounds you very \nquickly forget the ones who\u2019ve just left because you\u2019re onto the next batch. You have to \ndevelop a sort of professional detachment whereby you listen to them sympathetically \nat the time and help in any way you can. But when you leave you have to leave that at \nwork. If you were to take it with you I think it would be a huge obstacle because you\u2019d \nbe useless to the next batch that come through. \n \nThe transience of detainees means that this manager is unwilling to engage with them to \nthe same extent as before the system of moving detainees came into force. While it would \nstill be possible to track individual cases, the manager cites \u2018professionalism\u2019 and the \nneeds of incoming detainees as justifications for not doing so. The moral sensibilities of \nthe manager cause him to respond to the mobility of detainees by reducing the level of \nsupport offered. Consequently, he is far less likely to utilise his authority to support the \ndetainees under his influence, for example in drafting letters of support or spending time \nexplaining their legal situation. In this way, the relationship between managers and \ndetainees is depersonalised as a result of the movement of detainees. \n \nThe mobility of asylum seekers can be seen to exert governmental effects by presenting \ndetainees in a particular, subjective way to those who have influence over them, \nundermining the basis for lasting relationships of support. As is the case with the asylum \nadvocacy community associated with the centre, the mobility of the asylum seekers in \nCampsfield affects their relationship with the managers, making them appear fleeting and \n 41\naltering managers\u2019 aspirations for the asylum seekers in their care. It is precisely through \nthe alteration of managers\u2019 and other member of staff\u2019s dispositions towards the detainees \nin their care that detainee mobility can be seen to exert governmental effects, not just \nupon the detainees but also over this ostensible powerful set of actors. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis paper has argued that the increasing mobility of asylum seekers around the detention \nestate has significant implications for both the advocacy groups and professionals who \nhold influence over their experiences in the UK. By considering the ways in which the \nmovement of asylum seekers depicts them in particular, subjective ways to those with \ninfluence over them, the paper has demonstrated one instance in which mobility has \ngovernmental effects. While the asylum advocates and staff at Campsfield were \nsometimes financially incentivised to act differently, at other times their mentalities \ntowards the asylum seekers in their care altered as a result of the strategy of intra-\ndetention estate mobility that has been effected. This argument indicates one way in \nwhich geographical thinking about space and time can contribute towards recent \nsociological theorisations of mobility. A long pre-occupation with the representative \neffects of social spacings and timings (Lefebvre, 1991, Soja, 1989) combines with more \nrecent theorisations concerning the governmental attributes of space (Huxley, 2007, \nLarner and Walters, 2004) to produce a critical standpoint from which to scrutinise \nmobility as a means of establishing and depicting the transience of subjects. \n 42\n The findings presented here are not intended to suggest that the movement of detained \nasylum seekers around the detention estate represents the only way in which asylum \nadvocates and asylum system mangers are constructed. There are clearly influences \nproceeding from the largely negative and defamatory discursive construction of asylum \nseekers in the media (Kaye, 2001, Mollard, 2001). Moreover, the training of asylum \nsector managers has also been shown to constitute a powerful influence over the degree \nto which they are likely to pursue asylum seekers\u2019 interests (D\u00fcvell and Jordan, 2003, \nWeber, 2003). Nevertheless, without wishing to deny the importance of these factors, it is \nthe argument of this paper that the construction of actors who hold influence over asylum \nseekers is also achieved through the presentational effect arising from detainees\u2019 \nmobility. \n \nA striking implication of the findings reported here relates to the objectivity and \nindependence of influential figures in and around the detention estate. While the removal \ncentre staff and asylum advocates discussed here are nominally autonomous, the effect of \nthe mobility of their charges undermines their objectivity, suggesting that a clearer focus \nupon the malleability of ostensibly powerful actors within the immigration sector is \nappropriate. \n \nFinally, given the salience of the representative effects that the mobility of asylum \nseekers can engender within the populations that have authority over them, attention is \ndrawn to the politics of mobility not only as an outcome but as part of a process of \n 43\nrepresentation. Since mobility is active in structuring the social world in such a way as to \nsoften or obscure certain elements within it, with the attendant material effects that this \nentails, it is conceivable that certain factions will compete in order to monopolise this \neffect. In other words, control over mobility may offer more than simply control over \nmovement, but also control over the perceptual implications that movement or inertia \nalso entails (Cresswell, 2006). While there is no evidence to suggest that \u2018the state\u2019 \n(which is, in any case, an unhelpfully vague abstraction here) directly engages in the \ncontrol of asylum seeker mobility for anything other than the immediate gains offered in \nterms of the control and subduing of the asylum seeker population, it is clear that political \nforces that seek to reduce the number of asylum seeker applications to the UK have \nindirectly benefited from the governmental advantages that this intra-detention estate \nmobility can offer through the representation of asylum seekers to those with influence \nover them in ways that are conducive to exclusionary uses, or non-uses, of this influence. \nIt is not unreasonable to expect that the dividends of mobility arising from their \npresentational effects may come to form sufficient reason to pursue the monopoly of \nmobility further in the future. \n 44\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \nAllen, J.
