The most \npopular choice of method used to study people's hopes and dreams has been either a \nquestionnaire (e.g., Kalakoski & Nurmi, 1995; Nurmi, Poole, & Katakoski, 1994; \nNurmi, Seginer, & Poole, 1990) or an events listing approach (e.g., Poole & Cooney, \n1987). Some researchers have elected to use interviews; for example, the intensive \ninterview technique developed by Levinson (1978, 1996). However, in the main, most \nresearchers have opted for the quick and cost efficient questionnaire.  \nThe research presented in this article draws from a much larger study that \nexamined young people's hopes and dreams for the future. The focus here is on the \neffectiveness of a story-writing approach in this investigation. The utility of this story-\nwriting approach is assessed by comparing results obtained from an interview method \nand a questionnaire. More specifically, I focus on on age and sex differences in young \npeople's dreams, and compare the findings yielded from each method. If, as is argued \nhere, identity is a life story, then using narrative techniques to investigate people's \nhopes and dreams could be of great benefit to researchers.  \n \nIdentity is a life story \nOver the past 20 years, there has been a growing interest in examining people\u2019s stories \nof their own lives (e.g., Bruner, 1986, Cohler, 1982; Gergen & Gergen, 1987; Mair, \n1990; McAdams, 1989, 1993, 1996; Ochberg, 1994; Polkinghorne, 1988; Sarbin, \n1986). Such theorists have proposed that human beings are storytellers by nature, and \nthat stories are a natural way to report experience. For example, Sarbin (1986) \nsuggested that almost everything of interest in psychology is narrative. In fact, he \nproposed that narrative may be a \u2018root metaphor\u2019 for psychology as a whole. Sarbin \nargued that to know a person one must know the story in which that person is \n \n \n 4 \n \nparticipating. Making sense of others requires knowledge of their subjective \nexperience. Mair (1988) also suggested that psychology is approached as a storytelling \ndiscipline. He claimed that we live in and through our stories. Mair (1988) stated that \nthe only world we can know is a story world. Moreover, Howard (1991) argued that: \n \nWe are in the process of creating value in our lives - of finding the meaning of our \nlives. A life becomes meaningful when one sees himself or herself as an actor \nwithin the context of a story - be it a cultural tale, a religious narrative, a family \nsaga, the march of science, a political movement, and so forth (p. 196). \n \nMany narrative psychologists are more concerned with what people \u2018say\u2019, than \nwhat they \u2018do\u2019. Bruner (1987) has proposed that \"Narrative imitates life, life imitates \nnarrative. 'Life' in this sense is the same kind of construction of the human \nimagination as 'a narrative' is\" (p. 13). In addition, Ricoeur (1984) has argued that \nthere seems to be no other way of describing \u2018lived time\u2019 except in the form of \nnarrative. Even if we were to give a brief account of events that have happened to us, \nthese events would be chosen according to who we now see ourselves to be and thus \nwould take place in the form of narrative. He argued that we do not copy reality (i.e., \nrecall the empirical facts) but rather give a new reading of events. Other theorists such \nas Neisser and Fivush (1994) have taken a similar line of argument, stating that it is \nimportant to recognize that narratives are not fixed or static, but rather change with \nevery re-telling. \nThe stance taken in this article is that it is important to recognize, in line with \nthe theorists cited previously, that the stories people construct about their lives are \ninfluenced by how they see themselves at a particular point in time. In particular, Dan \nMcAdams' understanding of identity is drawn from in this current research. McAdams \n \n \n 5 \n \nhas focused of the stories that individuals construct. He has used the term 'personal \nmyth' to describe the stories people create when forming their identity. In essence, a \n'personal myth' is \"an act of imagination that is a patterned integration of our \nremembered past, perceived present, and anticipated future\" (McAdams, 1993, p.12). \nThe personal myth does not change dramatically from day to day, but rather will \nundergo transformations over time (McAdams, 1996). Therefore, the early memories \nwe recall can be considered an indication of our present understanding of the self. We \nchoose in our present lives to remember particular events in our past in a certain way. \nLikewise, we select possible future scenarios depending on how we see ourselves in \nour current lives. This means that stories of the self can change with each re-telling \ndepending on who one understands oneself to be in the present. Our memories of the \npast and our projections of the future are not fixed. Identity is a life story. In \naccordance with this view, I explore the utility of a story-writing method in the \ninvestigation of young people's hopes and dreams for the future.  \n \nMeasuring hopes and dreams \nThis current research investigates one aspect of the personal myth - individuals' \nnarratives of their future lives. Past research on hopes and dreams has focused \nprimarily on individuals in their mid-teens. Given that identity is neither determined \nnor fixed by the end of adolescence, there is a need to examine individuals\u2019 dreams \nbeyond mid-adolescence. Although adolescence is an appropriate developmental stage \nto examine in terms of life choices, there is also a need to focus research beyond \nadolescence, in light of the substantial changes that are still occurring in the lives of \nyoung adults (Clausen, 1995). Hence, in this study I elected to examine young adults' \nhopes and dreams for the future and the impediments they foresee to these dreams. \n \n \n 6 \n \nNo standardized narrative method exists for conducting narrative research. For \nexample, some researchers prefer to use biography, whereas others prefer a story-\nwriting technique. Although some narrative techniques, such as the 'sentence \ncompletion test' (e.g., Agarwal & Tiwari, 1988) and Levinson's (1996) intensive \ninterview technique have been used by researchers when investigating people's hopes \nfor the future, these techniques are not common. It is proposed here that although \nnarrative techniques are more time consuming, they can present a richer picture and \ngive greater insights into the construction of identity than other, more traditional \nmethods. \nIn examining the usefulness of a story-writing methodology in the \ninvestigation of young people's hopes and dreams for the future, I compared three \nmethods in this article: (a) a questionnaire method, (b) an interview method, and (c) a \nstory-writing method. Usefulness was determined by how adequately each method \nwas able to evaluate how young people would 'like' to see their future lives. \nIn our quest to determine the most appropriate techniques to examine the life \nstory, we also need to consider the different types of 'selves' that various methods \nmight be measuring. Markus and Nurius (1986, 1987) have developed a theory about \n\u2018possible selves\u2019. They argued that the three possible selves include: the \u2018expected \nself\u2019, the \u2018hoped for self\u2019, and the \u2018feared self\u2019. The \u2018expected self\u2019 is the person one \nbelieves one can realistically become. According to these theorists, the \u2018expected self\u2019 \nacts as the focal point for one\u2019s energies in striving for the future. In contrast, the \n\u2018hoped for self\u2019 is farther away from what the self presently is. The \u2018hoped for self\u2019 \nmay or may not be realistic. Finally, the \u2018feared self\u2019 is a possible self that one does \nnot desire to become. The \u2018feared self\u2019 serves as a motivator, so that the individual \n \n \n 7 \n \ntakes action to avoid that possible self. In this paper, it is the \u2018hoped for self\u2019 that is \ninvestigated. \nIn addition, I take account of Higgins and his colleagues\u2019 (Higgins, 1987; \nAlexander & Higgins, 1993; and Strauman & Higgins, 1987) distinction between the \ndifferent aspects of the self. They proposed that we need to consider three selves: an \n\u2018actual self\u2019, an \u2018ideal self\u2019 and an \u2018ought to self\u2019. The \u2018actual self\u2019 is the \nrepresentation of how you or another actually believes you are; the \u2018ideal self\u2019 is the \nrepresentation of how you or another would like to see yourself, including hopes and \nwishes for you; and the \u2018ought to self\u2019 represents the attributes that you believe you \nshould possess. It is not always clear whether researchers are tapping into actual \nselves, ideal selves or ought to selves, when they are investigating people\u2019s future \nlives. For example, a teenage girl who is asked to list her hopes and fears for the future \nmight be writing the hopes she thinks that as an adolescent female she ought to have. I \nam interested in how effective the three different methods are at elucidating the 'ideal' \nself in respect to young people's hopes for the future. \n \nAims of this research \nThis study contributes to the research that has investigated people\u2019s hopes and dreams \nfro the future by examining age and sex differences in young people\u2019s dreams. \nPast studies of people\u2019s hopes, dreams, and concerns for the future have \nfocused mainly on adolescence (e.g., Gillies, 1989; Greene, 1986; Greene & \nWheatley, 1992; Nurmi, Poole, & Seginer, 1995; Seginer, 1992; Trommsdorff, Lamm, \n& Schmidt, 1979) because it is at this age the transition from childhood to adulthood \noccurs. The onset and completion of adolescence is typically are defined by biological \nand social changes, which makes the actual age range for this period somewhat fuzzy; \n \n \n 8 \n \nhowever, most research concentrates on the secondary school years, from ages 13 to \n18. In respect to hopes and dreams studies, few studies have moved beyond mid-\nadolescence to examine the transition period from late adolescence into adulthood. I \nattempt to redress this omission by examining the hopes and dreams of older \nadolescents (17-22 years) and young adults' (28-33 years) hopes and dreams. \nIn line with past research, sex differences are also considered. For example, \nRoberts and Newton\u2019s (1987) review of four unpublished dissertations based on \nLevinson\u2019s theory found that, unlike those of men, women\u2019s Dreams were usually \nsplit between occupational and interpersonal goals. Other studies of adolescents\u2019 \ndreams have found that boys tend to be more interested in material dreams, whereas \ngirls are more interested in dreams relating to future family (Nurmi, 1991). \nAccordingly, I explicitly examine sex differences in young adults\u2019 dreams and \nobstacles to these dreams. \nTowards this end, several methods were employed so that findings from the \nstory-telling method could be compared with those from an interview and \nquestionnaire method. The story-writing method was the first method used, next an \ninterview was constructed in light of the themes generated from the story-writing \nmethod, and finally a questionnaire was constructed out of the themes generated from \nthe first two methods. Although the sequence of methods employed could indeed \ninfluence the final assessment of the benefit of each method, it was the preferred \nmeans to generate the maximum amount of themes, without limiting the scope of the \nresearch too early in the study. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to explore the \nvalue of a story-writing method in the investigation of young people's hopes and \ndreams. Because of the breadth of data collected from the three methods reported here, \nit is impossible to report all of the results. Hitherto, the results that relate to answering \n \n \n 9 \n \nthe main research question of the utility of a story-writing method are included in this \narticle. \n \nMETHODS \nA multi-method approach was employed to research young people's hopes and dreams \nfor the future. For the first study a story-writing method was devised, in the second \nstudy interviews were conducted, and in the third study a survey was administered.  \n \nStudy 1: Story-writing \nParticipants first completed a short questionnaire asking for their demographic details. \nThen they were asked to write a story about how they would like to see themselves in \n10 years time. They were given an hour to complete the task, although most \nparticipants took about 40 minutes to write their stories. The instructions were as \nfollows: \n \nWrite a story about how you would like to see yourself in the next 10 years. Write the \nstory in the third person. Include as much detail as possible and particularly avoid \ncensoring details that seem irrelevant. Avoid psychological interpretation. Include \nany obstacles that get in the way of achieving your dreams\/goals. Produce the most \nvivid story about how you will achieve your dreams\/goals. \n \nThese instructions were devised drawing from past studies that have asked adolescents \nto write essays about their future. For example, Gillespie and Allport (1955) and \nM\u00f6nks (1968) had their subjects write essays anticipating their futures entitled \u201cFrom \n \n \n 10 \n \nnow to 2000 A.D.\u201d Poole (1983) had respondents write down how their lives would be \nin 10 years time. They were asked to write an essay on the following topic: \nMyself in ten years\u2019 time: e.g. what kind of job you\u2019ll have, whether or not you\u2019ll \nbe married, the kind of person you\u2019d like to marry, where you\u2019ll live, what kind of \nperson you\u2019ll be, what kinds of things you\u2019ll be doing, etc. (Poole, 1983, p. 238). \n \nThis seemed an appropriate focus for the narrative approach. However, I decided to \nexclude from the instructions suggestions of themes to focus on, so as not to close off \nthemes that might emerge in the stories. Furthermore, I was interested in the obstacles \nthat participants foresaw in relation to their dreams; thus, the directions requested \nparticipants to write the obstacles to their dreams. In addition, some concepts from \nmemory work (Crawford, Kippax, Onyx, Gault, & Benton, 1992; Haug, 1987) were \nconsidered in developing the instructions. A content analysis was carried out to clarify \nthe number and types of dreams and impediments included in their stories. \n \nParticipants. The sample consisted of 140 men and 140 women from Sydney, \nAustralia. Two age groups were included: 140 participants were 17-22 year olds (M = \n19.0, SD = 1.61), and 140 participants were 28-33 year olds (M  = 29.9, SD  = 2.02). \nFirst year psychology students from two universities participated in this study. \nOther groups who participated included: students\u2019 friends; social groups; and people \nattending two of Sydney\u2019s markets (one in the inner city, and the other located in the \noutskirts of Sydney). \nIn this sample, 3% had achieved a high school education, 9% had a school \ncertificate, 5% had technical qualifications, 54% had completed the higher school \ncertificate (year 12), 23% had a degree or diploma, and 7% had achieved postgraduate \nqualifications. Although this sample is a little skewed towards the better educated, it is \n \n \n 11 \n \na reasonably good representation of the Australian population. In May 1997a (close to \nthe time this sample was obtained), the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that of \n15-34 year olds, 46.0% had not completed the Higher School Certificate, 32.3% had \ncompleted the higher school certificate, 21.7% had post-school qualifications. It \nshould be noted that 24.9% of the ABS population (considering it begins at 15 years) \nwere still at school. When we consider that the age groups are somewhat different, \nwith more people expected to be at school in the ABS population, the sample appears \nto be representative of the population. \nTable 1 indicates that this particular sample is more skewed toward \nprofessionals and intermediate clerical workers\/salespeople\/personal service workers \n(ABS, 1997b). Those not included in the table were either students or unemployed. \nFinally, 89% of the sample were born in Australia, another 2.5% came from \nEnglish speaking countries, and 9% came from non-English speaking countries. \n \nTable 1 \n \nPercentages for participants\u2019 occupations \n \nOccupation n = 197 \n (%) \nABS \n(%) \nManagers 11.2 7.5 \nProfessionals 27.4 17.5 \nTrades People 10.2 13.6 \nClerical\/personal service \nworkers \n45.2 31.8 \nLaborers 2.5 10.1 \nPlant Operators\/drivers 0.5 9.1 \nParaprofessionals 3.0 10.4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 \n \nStudy 2: Interviews \nInstrument. In the second study, a semi-structured interview schedule was used. \nParticipants were questioned about the specific dreams that emerged in Study 1; \nhowever, the interview also allowed for flexibility to concentrate on dreams that \nparticipants considered important. \n \nAs in Study 1, the interview schedule asked participants to focus on how they would \nlike to see themselves in 10 years time. Demographic details were collected again. \nQuestions were also included about dreams that participants had already formed and \ntried to live out. Participants first were requested to describe the dreams they had for \nthe next 10 years, in as much detail as possible. Then they were asked to explain how \nthey might go about achieving these dreams and to consider any obstacles they \nforesaw to achieving these dreams. These interviews were audio taped and transcribed \nfor analysis. \n \nParticipants. The sample for the interview method was recruited from similar groups \nto that used in Study 1, including university students, people attending markets and \nsocial groups. It consisted of 24 men and 24 women from Sydney, Australia, of whom \n24 were 17-22 year olds (M = 20.5, SD = 1.5) and 24 were 28-33 year olds (M = 30.6, \nSD = 1.8).  \nOf these, 4% had achieved a school certificate (year 10), 52% had achieved \ntheir higher school certificate, 8% had achieved technical qualifications, 13% had \nachieved a diploma, 20% had achieved a degree, and 3% had achieved postgraduate \nqualifications. \n \n \n 13 \n \n The participants\u2019 occupations included: 8.3% managers, 16.7% professionals, \n4.2% trades people, 18.8% clerical positions, 22.9% salespeople or personal service \nworkers, 6.3% laborers, 10.4% paraprofessionals, and 12.5% were students or \nunemployed.  \nNinety-two percent of the sample were Australian born, 2.1% of the sample \nwere born in English speaking countries, and 6.3% of the sample were born in non-\nEnglish speaking countries.  \n \nStudy 3: Questionnaire \nInstrument. The main themes and sub-themes that emerged from the previous studies \nwere used in the questionnaire (see author for copy of questionnaire). The \u2018future-\norientation questionnaire\u2019 (Nurmi, et al., 1990) was also drawn from to assist in the \nwording of the questionnaire. As in the Future-Orientation Questionnaire, this \nquestionnaire asked \u2018how important\u2019 are particular dreams, and \u2018how often\u2019 they \nthought about these dreams. However, to be consistent with Study 1 and Study 2, the \nquestionnaire asked respondents to consider themselves in 10 years time. Most of the \nquestionnaire took the form of forced-choice questions, typically on a 5-point Likert \nscale. For example, respondents were asked: In ten years time, how important will a \ncareer be to you? The responses were based on the following: 1 (not at all important), \n2 (not very important), 3 (somewhat important), 4 (rather important), and 5 \n(extremely important). An open-ended question inviting respondents to add any \nfurther comments to the questionnaire once they had completed it.  \n  \n \n \n 14 \n \nParticipants. In an attempt to obtain consistency in each of the samples, participants \nused in Study 3 were again recruited from similar groups including university \nstudents, and social groups. The sample consisted of 100 men and 100 women from \nSydney, Australia, of whom 100 were 17-22 year (M = 19.5, SD = 1.7) and 100 were \n28 - 33 year olds (M = 29.2, SD = 1.7). \nOf these, 1% had achieved high school level, 4% had achieved a school \ncertificate, 51% had achieved their higher school certificate, 10% had achieved \ntechnical qualifications, 7% had achieved a diploma, 21% had achieved a degree, and \n6% had achieved postgraduate qualifications. \n Sixty-seven percent of the sample were Australian born, 20% of the sample \nwere born in English speaking countries, and 13% of the sample were born in non-\nEnglish speaking countries. Although the samples recruited for the three studies were \nslightly skewed toward a more educated and higher socio-economic class, they were \noverall fairly similar when compared to each other (e.g., educational levels shown in \nTable 2). Furthermore, each method required participants to complete the task under \nsimilar conditions. Once people granted their consent, they were required to write \ntheir story, to be interviewed or to fill out a survey in one of the labs at Macquarie \nUniversity. I carried out all three studies. Hence, although having different subjects \nparticipate in each of the studies could indeed in part effect the results, similarities in \ndemographic variables and conditions most probably eliminated some of the potential \nbias. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 \n \nTable 2 \nPercentages of participants for education level achieved \nEducational level achieved Study 1 Study 2 Study 3 \nHigh School 3% 0% 1% \nSchool Certificate 9% 4% 4% \nTechnical Qualifications 5% 8% 10% \nHigher School Certificate 54% 52% 51% \nDegree, diploma 23% 33% 28% \nPostgraduate 7% 3% 6% \n \n \nFindings. The aim of this study was to examine the utility of a story-writing method in \nresearching young people's 'ideal' selves in respect to their hopes and dreams for the \nfuture. It did so by comparing some of the themes generated and the age and sex \ndifferences elicited by three methods. Due to the breadth of data collected from each \nmethod, it is impossible to provide a detailed account of every finding in this paper. \nInstead, I present the results that help answer the research question concerning the \nusefulness of a story-writing method in the analysis of young people's ideal future \nlives. \n \nANALYSIS \nStudy 1: Story-writing \nIn the story-writing method a content analysis was initially carried out to clarify the \nnumber and types of dreams and impediments included in their stories. An initial \nreading indicated the presence of many of the themes revealed in past studies (see \nNurmi, 1991). However, the overriding impression was the complexity of the \ninterwoven identities. It became a challenge to code the stories without sacrificing too \nmuch of their richness. Given that this study was also used to generate themes for the \n \n \n 16 \n \nfollowing studies, I considered it necessary to document as many of the themes as \npossible, even if only a few of the participants mentioned them. The main dreams \nwere concerned with, occupation, finances, romance, parenting or having children; \ntravel, leisure, friendship, parents and siblings, religious and political beliefs. These \nmain themes were next broken down into sub-themes, which included further \ndescription of the dreams and impediments to these dreams. To check reliability of the \ncoding procedure, 10% of the data was re-coded by a trained scorer. Inter-coder \nreliability was high, ranging from Kappa 0.75 - 1.00 \nLogistic regression was used to analyze the data. Initial analyses for the main \ncategories of dreams (occupation, finance, family, marriage, friends, children, leisure, \ntravel, religion and politics) included the independent variables age and sex, and their \ninteractions. The same variables were used in the analysis of the sub-categories. If the \ninteraction was significant, tests of simple effects were carried out, using a \nconservative p value of 0.025. If there were any empty cells, the Pearson Chi-square \nwas used to test for simple effects. Significance for the variables age and gender were \ntaken to be at a p value of 0.05 or less. \n \nStudy 2: Interviews \nThe interview transcripts first were examined for the themes that emerged from the \nstory-writing method. All of the main themes and many of the sub-themes revealed in \nStudy 1 were also uncovered in this study. The transcripts were then re-read to locate \nany other pertinent themes. Although no new main themes emerged, some additional \nsub-themes were yielded in this analysis. \n Logistic regression was again used in this study. Age and sex and the \ninteraction of age and sex, were once more included in the analyses. If any \n \n \n 17 \n \ninteractions were significant, tests of simple effects were carried out, using a \nconservative p value of .025. If there were any empty cells, the Pearson Chi-square \nanalysis was used to test for simple effects. Once more, to check reliability of the \ncoding procedure, 10% of the data was re-coded by a trained scorer. Inter-coder \nreliability was again high, ranging from Kappa 0.75 - 1.00 \n \nStudy 3: Questionnaire \nThe independent variables age and sex and their interactions were used to analyze the \nquestionnaire. Given that most of the dependent variables were numerical, ANOVAs \nwere used in the analysis. Where dependent variables were categorical, a logistic \nregression was employed. The main effects employed a p value of 0.05, while the \ninteractions used a p value of .01 \n \n \nTHE DREAMS \nReported in Table 3 are the frequencies at which participants mentioned the main \ndreams in Studies 1 and 2 and those who rated these as important in Study 3. The \ndifferent ways these results were obtained needs to be highlighted here. In the story-\nwriting method, respondents were permitted to write freely about their possible future \nlives; in the interviews all the main dreams revealed in analysis carried out for Study 1 \nwere used as prompts; whereas in Study 3, one of the questionnaires required \nrespondents to rate their three most important dreams, given the same prompts used in \nthe interview. Therefore, despite some of the interesting comparisons that can be made \nwith these results, the comparisons nevertheless need to be treated with some caution. \nFor example, it could easily be argued that had the participants in the story-writing \n \n \n 18 \n \nmethod be given the prompts travel, leisure, friendship, politics and religion, more of \nthe participants might have included these themes in their stories. \n \nTable 3 \nFrequencies and percentages of participants mentioning the main dreams  \n Study 1 Study 2 Study 3 \nThe dreams freq \n(%) \nfreq \n(%) \nfreq \n(%) \nOccupational 264 \n(94.3) \n48 \n(100) \n123 \n(62) \nFinancial 206 \n(73.6) \n48 \n(100) \n22 \n(11) \nRomantic \nRelationships \n203 \n(72.5) \n35 \n(72.9) \n151 \n(76) \nParental\/having \nchildren \n166 \n(59.3) \n40 \n(83.3) \n72 \n(36) \nTravel Dream 152 \n(54.3) \n45 \n(93.8) \n42 \n(21) \nLeisure Dream  102 \n(36.4) \n48 \n(100) \n20 \n(10) \nFriendship Dream 82 \n(29.3) \n43 \n(89.6) \n43 \n(22) \nParents\/siblings \nDream \n47 \n(16.8) \n48 \n(100) \n69 \n(35) \nReligion\/spiritual 31 \n(11.1) \n37 \n(77.1) \n34 \n(17) \nPolitical beliefs 23 \n(8.2) \n37 \n(77.1) \n0 \n(0) \n \nAcross all three studies, occupation and romantic relationships were considered the \nmost important and most frequently mentioned dreams. Nurmi (1991) points out, in \nhis review of studies focusing on adolescents\u2019 dreams, that occupation is the most \nfrequently mentioned dream, and that romantic relationships also rate fairly highly. It \nis interesting that when participants were interviewed, religion was rated as the third \nmost important dream (a result atypical of past research). This might be because the \ninterview tapped into \u2018expected\u2019 or \u2018ought to\u2019 selves; Religion is a dream these \n \n \n 19 \n \nparticipants felt they ought to be considering for their future lives. Furthermore, in the \nquestionnaire, unlike Study 1, financial dreams were seen as not important, while \ndreams about parents and siblings were considered reasonably important. Again, this \nsupports the idea that different methods uncover different selves. \n Overall, the three studies in general produced similar findings. In every \ninstance where age and sex differences were found they were in the same direction. \nDespite these similarities, there are a number of important differences. For the sake of \nbrevity, only the differences that contribute to the main research question are reported \nhere.  \n \nSTUDY 1: GENERATION OF THEMES \nThe intention of using the story-method first was to generate themes. This indeed \nproved to be a wise choice. In addition to the main dreams cited previously, the data \nrevealed numerous sub-themes. For example some of the sub-themes that stemmed \nfrom occupational dreams included; becoming successful in one's career, requiring \nqualifications for one's job, a glamorous job, having a high status, influential job, \nwork that will benefit society, being promoted, a need to balance a relationship and \nchildren and a career, lack of abilities as an impediment to one's hoped for job, and a \ndesire to reach the pinnacle of one's career before having children. (There were more \nsub-themes for occupation not listed here.)  \n Past research on hopes and dreams has typically focused their research on a \nmore broad level. Few studies have moved beyond the main dreams (such as those \noutlined in Table 3) to include sub-themes. Therefore, the story-writing method \nallowed for both a macro and microanalysis of people's dreams. In fact, the sub-\n \n \n 20 \n \nthemes yielded important age and sex differences that would have been missed if the \nanalysis had simply focused on the dreams per se. \n The interviews were also useful in the generation of themes. Although fewer \ndreams emerged in the interview study, it did elicit a few more sub-themes not \nmentioned in Study 1.  \n \nGrand Dreams formed in one's youth \n One of the interesting findings revealed by the story-writing method was that \nsome of the younger participants (17-22 years) described many grandiose dreams for \nthe future. For example, many of them seemed over-ambitious in their career dreams, \nwhile some aspired to extraordinary achievements (such as finding a cure for cancer). \nOthers wrote that they would be famous (such as being a supermodel, or in a rock \nband), while others hoped to marry someone famous. To give some examples of \nextracts from these types of dreams: \n \n\"Currently she is in charge of promoting channel 9's new series and current affairs and \nis working very closely with the Packer family.\" (18 year old female) \n \n\" After four and a half years in the work force the opportunity arose for him to play \nsoccer for Manchester United which he took.\" (18 year old male) \n \n\"It had been a lot of hard work to get here as the world psychological leader, writer of \n3 best sellers.\" (18 year old female) \n \n\"She became acclaimed as a leading author and human rights activist.\" (19 year old \nfemale) \n \n \n \n 21 \n \nMore specifically, the statistical analysis revealed that older adolescents (17- \n22 years) wrote more than young adults (28- 33 years) about having a glamorous \noccupation (such as a rock star, supermodel, rock journalist and so forth), \u03c72 (1, N = \n280)  = 7.08, p < .01, a benevolent occupation (such as, a human rights activist), \u03c72 (1, \nN = 280) = 6.55, p < .01), and becoming wealthy, \u03c72 (1, N = 280) = 18.5, p < .001. \nWomen wrote more than men about having a powerful and successful partner, \u03c72 (1, \nN = 280) = 8.22, p < .01. Moreover, younger women wrote more than older women \nthat they would have a high status and influential job, \u03c72 (1, N = 140) = 5.53, p < \n0.25). Given that we do not know the abilities and potentialities for these participants, \nit is difficult to argue that these themes are unrealistic; however, the story writing \nmethod does highlight the different tone evident in these participants' personal myths.  \nThis unrealistic tone depicted in some of the younger group\u2019s stories is in line \nwith Levinson\u2019s concept of the \u2018Dream\u2019. Levinson (1978) argued that initially the \nDream is poorly developed and is not necessarily connected with reality. \nConsequently, it may start by taking a dramatic or unrealistic form. He also argued \nthat if the Dream is unrelated to the person\u2019s life structure it will fade away and lose \npurpose, and that the \u2018age thirty transition period\u2019 (28-33 years) is a time when people \nbegin to settle down and a \u2018de-illusioning process\u2019 begins (Levinson, Darrow, Klein, \nLevinson, & McKee, 1976). If the Dream is not well formed it might become \nabandoned or re-worked at this stage. This conceptualization is supported by the \nyounger groups\u2019 unrealistic ambitions, while the older group was more cognizant of \nthe real opportunities available, and the real impediments to their dreams. For \nexample, the young adults were more concerned than the older adolescents about such \nthings as: a lack of money being an impediment to their career dreams, \u03c72 (1, N =280) \n= 4.55, p < .05, the need to provide for their children, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 4.29, p < .05, \n \n \n 22 \n \nand save money, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 3.86, p < .05, and the desire to make financial plans \nwith their partner, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 13.56, p < .001. \nThese results can be further explained by Elkind\u2019s (1974, 1978, Elkind & \nBowen, 1979) notion of the \u2018personal fable\u2019. Elkind argued that adolescents go \nthrough a stage where they develop heroic stories about themselves. He considered \nthat lack of experience in the world partly explained adolescents\u2019 egocentricity. This \nidea of the personal fable could explain why more of the younger group in this present \nstudy desired a career where they would be famous and acquire great wealth. \nAlthough Elkind argued that the personal fable is more evident during mid-\nadolescence, it is clear from Study 1 that some older adolescents and young adults still \ndevelop narratives that resemble a personal fable (Whitty, 1997, 1998, in press). \n As a corollary of these results, Studies 2 and 3 included a focus on whether \nyounger participants develop less realistic dreams. When we examine these results, a \nsomewhat different picture emerges. \nThe overall tone evident in the interviews collected in Study 2 appeared to be \nmore serious and somewhat less ambitious than in the story-writing method. \nCongruous with Study 1, the older adolescents stated more than the young adults \nabout having the dream to become wealthy, \u03c72 (1, N = 48) = 4.18, p < .05. However, \nin contrast to Study 1, there were no significant differences for wanting a glamorous \noccupation or a benevolent occupation. Further, more participants in Study 1 (32.5%) \nmentioned a glamorous occupation compared to Study 2 (22.9%), and more \nparticipants in Study 1 (22.1%) mentioned a benevolent occupation compared to \nStudy 2 (14.6%). Moreover, while 13.9% of participants in the first study wrote about \nthe desire for a powerful and successful partner, and 30% wrote about having a high \nstatus and influential job, these themes were non-existent in the second study.  \n \n \n 23 \n \n An explanation for these differences could be that the interview method \nelicited different responses from Study 1 because the interviewed participants were \nfaced with an interviewer, or a 'real audience'. Elkind's theory of the personal fable \nwas proposed as an explanation for why some of the older adolescents in Study 1 \ndeveloped stories involving extraordinary sub-themes. In turn, this theory could be \nused to explain the differences in responses between Study 1 and 2. In conjunction \nwith the personal fable theory, Elkind argued that adolescents have an exaggerated \nbelief that everyone is watching them. This he termed the 'imaginary audience'. He \nposited that many adolescents believe that since people are being critical of them, \nacting outrageously makes little difference. It therefore appears that the story-writing \nmethod had some of the participants, especially in the younger group, envisioning this \nimaginary audience. This might explain why more of the stories in the story-writing \nmethod contained grand and extraordinary themes. Furthermore, since participants \nwere faced with a real audience in Study 2 they may have been likely to provide \nanswer they saw as suitable to that audience. For example, in Study 2, more men \n(12.5%) than women (0%) stated that they felt advantaged in their careers because of \ntheir sex. Given that the participants in Study 2 were interviewed by a woman, this \nmight have appeared the acceptable response. It is poignant that this theme was not \nmentioned by any of the 280 participants in Study 1. \nGiven that the questionnaire presented numerical data, where respondents \nrated the importance of each theme on a 5-point Likert scale it is a little more difficult \nto compare results borne out from the questionnaire with the categorical data \ngenerated from Studies 1 and 2. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that age and sex \ndifferences elicited for grandiose themes in Study 1 were typically not significant in \nStudy 3. The only significant difference for the grand themes outlined above was for \n \n \n 24 \n \nthe desire to work in a benevolent occupation. Further, rather than an age difference, \nin Study 3 women scored higher on this sub-theme than men, F (1, 199) = 4.88, p < \n.05. \n \nDifferent Selves \nThe main aim of this paper is to elucidate the value of a story-writing approach in the \nstudy of young people's 'hoped for futures'. It appears from the results just outlined, \nalong with some further examples given here, that the story-writing method was more \nsuccessful at elucidating participants' 'idea' or 'hoped for selves', whereas Studies 1 \nand 3 tapped more into 'actual', 'ought to' or 'expected selves'.  \nAs described above, Study 2 yielded more serious narratives than Study 1 and \nfound participants often justifying their responses to the interviewer. For example, the \nparticipants who mentioned that they were advantaged in the workplace because of \ntheir gender, and that religion is an important dream (see Table 3), could be projecting \ntheir 'ought to' or 'expected' aspects of the self. Furthermore, a unique sub-theme to \nStudy 2, stated by 10.4% of the participants, was that a financial dream was not a \npriority in their lives. Hence, Study 2 elicits a more socially accepted response, that \nalthough one might hope to be wealthy or comfortable in the future, it should not be a \nmajor concern in one's life.  \nOnce more, the more socially desirable responses evident in Study 3 show that \nthis study was more inclined than Study 1 to measure respondents 'actual', 'expected' \nor 'ought to' selves. It is noteworthy that while no significant differences in the first \ntwo studies were obtained for an occupational dream, Study 3 found that younger \nparticipants scored higher than the older for wanting an occupational dream, F (1, 199) \n= 6.78, p < .01. This dream could have been overemphasized by the younger \n \n \n 25 \n \nparticipants in Study 3 since occupation is something younger participants are \nexpected to consider as important. Therefore, in this instance, the questionnaire has \nprobably revealed participants' 'ought to' selves. To give another example, women \nscored higher than men in Study 3 when asked directly if they were concerned about \nnot finding the right partner, F (1, 199) = 12.21, p < .001. Moreover, another result \nexclusive to Study 3 was that women scored higher than men for stating they would \nwork hard at their romantic relationship, F (1, 199) = 3.79, p < 0.05. These results \nappear to be fairly realistic given the many requirements for a perfect partner and the \nemphasis they placed on their romantic dreams across all three studies. It could be \nargued that this reflects women's 'actual' concerns. \n \nCONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE UTILITY OF A STORY-WRITING METHOD \nThe story-writing approach was very successful at elucidating the complexity of the \ndream. This study found that the strengths of the story-writing method were its ability \nto generate themes and to uncover 'ideal' or 'hoped for selves'.   \nNarrative psychologists propose that when we consider identity we should take \ninto account the stories people have about their lives, rather than how their lives \nsimply actualize. Some have argued for the inclusion in research of both real and \nunreal aspects of the self (e.g., Bruner, 1986; McAdams, 1993). In fact, Sarbin (1998) \nhas claimed that: \n \nThe words real and reality are excluder words. They tell only what something \nis not, and then only if the context is known\u2026It is important to recognize that real \nis employed as a term to convince one\u2019s self or another that the credibility assigned \nto an imagining is warranted (p.24). \n \n \n \n 26 \n \nIt is likely that some of the Study 1 participants\u2019 stories will not in reality eventuate. \nDoes this mean that these narratives speak less truth? If the young woman does not \neventually finish up in charge of Channel 9\u2019s new series and \u2018work closely with the \nPacker family,\u2019 and if the young man does not become a successful soccer player for \nManchester United, does this make their narratives any less authentic, truthful or \nvalid? Simply because narratives appeared to the researcher to be grounded in fantasy \ndoes not mean they were not realistic possibilities for these individuals. Perhaps the \nyoung man who foresaw being chosen by Manchester United was, in fact, an excellent \nsoccer player who could possibly be chosen to play in one of England\u2019s finest football \nteams? However, even if this story does not actualize, it still contains a certain kind of \ntruth. Although the story-writing method produced some narratives with unrealistic \npossible futures, this does not mean that these narratives are inauthentic. As Sarbin \n(1998) argued, if we are only focusing on what is real, we are excluding parts of the \nnarrative. Hence, both \u2018realistic\u2019 and \u2018unrealistic\u2019 narratives were considered to fall \nwithin the range of the possible future self. It is also noteworthy that not all \nparticipants in Study 1 produced extraordinary stories, but rather the story-writing \nmethod provided a greater opportunity for those who would like to envisage grand \nfutures for themselves to do so. It is also interesting that the older adolescents were \nmore inclined to write these stories; perhaps this says something about the way we are \nsocialized to dream. \n Although one might argue that the exclusion of prompts was a weakness of \nthis specifically designed story-writing method, it can be counter-argued that this was \na strength of the research. Had the participants been promoted with certain dreams, \nthey might have felt less free to write about how they would 'like' to see their future \nlives. \n \n \n 27 \n \n In conclusion, this article reveals the need to examine identity formation after \nmid-adolescence and demonstrates the need for the inclusion of this story-writing \nmethod in future research. \nReferences \n \nAgarwal, A. & Tiwari, S.
