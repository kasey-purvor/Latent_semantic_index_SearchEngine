Specifically,\nstate-variable concepts are developed to establish operating mode\nboundaries with which to describe the internal behaviour of dual-\noutput resonant converters, and the impact of output leakage\ninductance. The resulting models are compared with those\nobtained from SPICE simulations and measurements from a\nprototype power supply under closed loop control to verify the\nanalysis, modeling and control predictions.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTo-date, several approaches have been explored to address\ncross-regulation, complexity and overall circuit performance\nissues of multi-output converters, the solutions being divided\ninto three distinct categories. The first regulates a single\nprimary output using closed-loop feedback, with the auxiliary\noutputs being semi-regulated and, therefore, subject to cross-\nregulation error. The second category achieves precise post-\nregulation of each output by using either linear regulators or\nhard-switched dc-dc converters. However, although relatively\nstraightforward to design, such circuits are rarely used in\npractice due to cost constraints. The third category is specific\nto applications which require only two regulated outputs, as is\ncommonly found in signal processing and microprocessor\nbased systems. They avoid the need for post-regulation by\nutilising two closed-loop feedback configurations. A 3rd-order\nLLC converter with two independently controlled outputs was\nreported in [1]. However, optimum performance\ncharacteristics have yet to be forthcoming, primarily due to the\nsignificant complexity associated with the highly non-linear\nbehaviour between the various outputs as a function of load.\nNevertheless, it is a solution that broadly falls within this third\ncategory that is the subject of this paper. Specifically, dual-\noutput resonant LCLC converters, are considered, with control\nof each output being achieved by switching the power devices\nasymmetrically over each half switching cycle using a\ncombination ofPWM and frequency control.\nII. DUAL O\/P LCLC-SPRC MODEL\nA half-bridge LCLC-SPRC with two outputs is shown in Fig.\n1(a). To achieve zero-voltage switching, the converter is\nassumed to operate on the negative gradient of the input-output\nfrequency characteristic, above the primary resonant peak.\nWhen operating in this region, the resulting waveforms can be\nsub-divided into two distinct time intervals, viz. intervals 1 and\n2, as depicted in Fig. 1(b):\nInterval 1: Clamping of the parallel capacitor voltage. Here,\nthe combined series inductor Ls (Fig. 1(c)) and capacitor Cs\nprovide resonant behaviour whilst the voltage across Lp and Cp\nis clamped by the output voltage. As the current through the\nseries inductor, LS, decays to zero, Cp begins to contribute to\nresonant behaviour, and operation enters the second interval.\ntS 1ip+L,\n+ RL\nGSW2\nRL2\n+V~6\n(a)\n(b)\nVc\nLL\nIL Vp\nDI\nVC\n- VCP24 C\nLl,P29T S\nLi.

Here,\nall the tank components contribute to resonant behaviour, with\nthe rectifier effectively becoming reverse biased. Current into\nboth the high- and low-side diodes remains zero, and the\nparallel capacitors are charged until their voltage is clamped at\neither +V0,,, or -V,,12, thereby providing the boundary at the\nend of this time interval. During each half-cycle of operation,\nthree Modes, Ml, M2, and M3 can be identified, as shown in\nFig. 1(b).\nCircuit Mode Ml (to < t < tl). At the start of Ml, SW2 is\nturned off at to and SWI turned on. The series inductor\ncurrent, iLs, is negative and flows through the internal diode of\nSWI, thereby facilitating ZVS of SWI. Also during this\nperiod, iLs allows D2 to conduct and transfer energy to support\nVOW2, whilst the voltage on Cp2 is clamped to VoW2. All the\nrectifier current, therefore, flows to the load. At the end of Ml,\nthe rectifier current iR2 has decayed to zero, and both the high\nside and low side diodes, and the output filter, are effectively\ndecoupled from the resonant tank.\nCircuit Mode M2 (t < t <t2). Here, the series resonant\ninductor current iLs becomes positive. Since SWI is turned on\nduring Ml, current flow is now through SWI. Initial\nconditions for this mode are that iLs=O and Vcp2= vout2- The\ninductor current iLs and parallel resonant capacitor voltages\ntake on a sinusoidal characteristic. Since the outputs are\neffectively disconnected from the tank, both Cp1 and Cp2\ncontribute to resonant behaviour. Both rectifier currents are\nzero, and the converter outputs are in an 'idle' state, with\nenergy being supplied solely by the charge on the filter\ncapacitors. By initially neglecting the rectifier on-state\nvoltage, and noting that the effective parallel resonant\ncapacitance Cp is the sum of the shunt network capacitances\nCpl and Cp2, vcpl during the capacitor charging period is\ndescribed by:\nCircuit Mode M3 ( t2 < t < TI \/2 ). At t = t2, D1 becomes\nforward biased whilst D2 reverse biased. The rectifier diode\ncurrent iR2 remains zero throughout the duration ofM3, and DI\nclamps the capacitor voltage vCPi to + Vout, until iLs decays to\nzero, at which time the second half cycle of operation\ncommences.\nFor 50%0 duty-cycle excitation, the 2nd half-cycle of operation\nis the mirror image of the first. However, for asymmetrical\nexcitation, the output rectifier diode (D2) non-conduction\nangle, associated with the series resonant inductor current\nbeing of negative polarity, is given by:\n(C2 = j2zlf-1C_ 2s Pvtot (4)\nlin\nwhere in =iLs- LP The voltage,P, across the parallel\nresonant capacitor can, therefore, be expressed as a function of\nthe angle 0 see Fig. 1(b):\nfor 0 = \u00b0 ..O\n-vt2 + X (I -cos(9))\nvotl - I2.in x (I cos(O)V)\n- Vo,t2\nfor 0 = 'i ..\nfor 9 =r . . .r+ 0,2\nfor\n= Z + 0,2 ... 2r\n(5)\nUnder steady-state conditions, the mean output current ioutl,\nflowing through Dl towards the output filter and load, can be\ndetermined from the mean current flowing through the rectifier\nwhen it is of positive polarity. Since this occurs during the\ninterval Oc1 < 0 < z, iout is given by:\n(6)I\n)r\nioutl =-21 x fJ,, sin(O)dO\nIi)\ncl,\nSubstituting (3) into (6) and evaluating the integral provides\nthe solution for ioutlIt2\ncp(t= cpi (t, )+ fi n sin(2)7,t)dt\np tl\nwhere iin = -(iLs - iLp )* Evaluating (1) with initial\nconditions VR (t4 ) = VCp1 (4) = Vju[2 yields:\n(1)\nvcpi (t2 ) -Vout2 + lin X (2 (t2 tl))2)inif,2fCfC (2)\nThe boundary for the end of the capacitor charging period is\nvCpl(t2) = +Voutl, which yields the rectifier non-conduction\nangle, Oc, associated with a positive polarity of current, iR,\nthrough the high side rectifier:\nt2 =2i x cos (-10,) oc, = cos 21f- ,J\n(3)\nwhere vtot = vout, + VOut2\nioutl = x (I +cos(p6 )) =in\" 7 Cvt0t (7)2f z\nSimple mathematical manipulation of (3) and (7) then gives the\ncorresponding rectifier non-conduction angle 751:\n5c Cos- r mout1 -fCpVtot ) (8)\nK'~~Il ZCfpVtot)\nVO,tl is determined by assuming the output filter\ncapacitance Cf is sufficiently large to impart negligible output\nvoltage ripple.

STATE-VARIABLE ANALYSIS\nA state-variable model describing the behaviour of the dual-\noutput converter can be obtained by considering the electrical\nnetwork shown in Fig. 1(c) and separating the dynamics into\n'fast' and 'slow' sub-systems, with their interaction related by\na set of coupling equations. The fast sub-system is considered\nto describe the dynamics of the resonant tank and power\nswitches:\ndvCS iLs diLs _ VCS VLP diLP VLP\ndt Cs dt Ls dt Lp\ndvCpl 'Ls -iLp -'RI-Cp2 -iR2 dvCp2 iLs - iLp iR2 iCpl iRl\ndt Cpl dt Cp2\n(1 1)\nThe output filter dynamics are described by:\ndvcf I - 'RI Vcf 1 dvcf 2 1R2 Vcf2 (12)\ndt Cf1 CflRLl dt Cf 2 Cf2RL2\nAs discussed, during interval t1-4 t2 (see Fig. 1(b)) vcpl is\nclamped to vcfi during the positive half-cycle, and conversely,\nto\n-vcf2 during the negative half-cycle, due to the action of the\ndiodes. By noting that there will be negligible current flowing\nthrough Cp during these periods, the rectifier input voltage is\ndependent on the direction of the current leaving the resonant\ntank inductances, i.e. iL = iLs -iLp . The relevant coupling\nterms are, therefore, obtained by equating voltages at either\nside ofthe rectifier for each respective half-cycle:\nvcpl sgn(iL)(VOtj +vdiode) sgn(iL)(vCf 1 +Vdiode) (13)\nvCp2 sgn(iL )(Vout2 + Vdiode) sgn(iL )(Vcf2 + Vdiode)\nAssuming a constant rectifier voltage, (12) can be manipulated\nto give:\ndvcpi dvcfI dvCp2 dvcf2 (4\ndt =sgn(iL ) dtl dt= sgn(iL) dt2 (14)\nConsidering the rectifier current, iR2, to be zero during the\npositive half-cycle of the parallel capacitor voltage, the\nrectifier current iRj, is given from:\n'L -R1 1Cp2 1R2\nCpI\n*\n_ CplCfl 'L -Cp2 -R2 sgn(iL)vf I\n1R1 +\nsgn(iL)Cpl + Cfl K Cpl CflRl )\nThis leads to the following coupling equations which describe\nthe rectifier currents within each half of a switching cycle:\nCplC (iL -iCp2- 1R2+ sgnQL ) fIfor vcpl Vout, + vdode\n1RI Sgnf(iL)CpI+Cfl Cp1 C IRLV d\nl 0 for vcpl <Vout0 + Vdode\nF C12C2 (it-L +iR sg1I(IL)VCf2\" -Cp\n'RIfor VCp2 out2 + Vdode\nR2 Sgn(IL )Cp2+Cf12 Cp2 Cf2RL2\n{ O for VCp2 < Vout2 + Vdode\n(16)\nsimplifies to VLp = Vcp I The state-variable equations for the\nparallel resonant capacitor voltage (11) can be simplified to:\n-vCpli 1S-iLp 'R dv '2 -'BLp R (17)\ndt 2Cp1 dt 2Cp2\nThe complete state-variable model of the dual load converter\n(excluding the effects of output leakage inductances) is,\ntherefore, given by:\nIo3X3 A1 o2x37\nX= A2 02X2 02X2 X + B\no2X3 o2X2 A\n(18)\nwhere\nX= VCpl VCp2 VC, 'Lp 'L, VCflVCJ\n2CP 2CP| I o0 01\nAl = iR I iR IA2 = Ip I\nL 2CP2 2CP2 LS \u00bcl 2\n0 1 LL Lj\nC,\nB[2CPI 2Cp2 012 Cf1 2 ]\nI1I\nA3 = CfRL\n0 Cf2RL2]\n(19)\nThe model can used to investigate the behaviour of dual load\nconverters when subject to asymmetrical input excitation. By\nway of example, the parameters of a candidate converter are\ngiven in Table I when supplied from a 30V dc link. A plot of\nthe resulting steady-state output voltage characteristics of the\nconverter, V0,t, and VW2, as a function of switching frequency\nand duty-cycle ratio is given in Fig. 2. It is evident that for\noperation above resonance, the sum of the output voltages\napplied to the loads increases as the operating frequency tends\nto the effective resonant frequency, for fixed values of duty-\ncycle ratio. Furthermore, for a 50O duty-cycle, giving\nsymmetric square-wave excitation of the tank, the converter\ndelivers identical voltages to both the high side and low side\noutputs, for a fixed operating frequency, as expected. For a\ngiven operating frequency, a decrease in the duty-cycle ratio,\nfrom 500O, is seen to deliver more energy from the resonant\ntank to energize output V,,ti, thereby yielding a\ncorrespondingly higher output voltage and power, and vice-\nversa. It is, therefore, clear that for balanced loads, the voltage\nand power distribution to each output can be independently\ninfluenced by a suitable choice of duty ratio and switching\nfrequency.\nTABLE I\nCONVERTER MODEL PARAMETERS\nParameters Value\nCharacteristic imDedance (Q) 2.5\nResonant inductance ratio, Ln 0.01\nResonant frequency,fJ (kHz) 130\nResonant capacitance ratio, C, 0.03\nSeries load quality factor, Qp' 6\n147\n= Sgn('L 'RI Vcf I\nCf I CfIRLI\nsignificance of the state-variables.

IMPACT OF OUTPUT LEAKAGE INDUCTANCE\nAlthough resonant converters are often designed to operate at\nrelatively high frequencies, typically in the 200-500 kHz range,\ndesigners must still consider the impact of low levels of\nleakage inductance on converter performance. This is\nparticularly evident for converters with multiple outputs, where\nthe presence of such effects significantly complicates the\nanalysis, particularly when determining the state of the parallel\nresonant inductor current, iLp, since the voltage seen across Lp\ncannot be assumed to be directly related to vc'p, as a result of\nthe voltages across the leakage inductances, LI,, and L1,2. The\nmodel must, therefore, be augmented with VLp to allow a\nsolution for iLp. The converter can be separated into fast and\nslow sub-systems, Fig. 3 showing a model of the resonant\nconverter 'fast' sub-system. Whilst the rectifier is omitted in\nthe state-variable representation, its influence on the fast sub-\nsystem is accommodated through the addition of current\nsources, as shown in Fig. 3. This step is justified by noting that\nthe interaction between the fast and slow sub-systems is solely\nbased on coupling equations consisting of the characteristics of\nthe rectifier output currents iR1 and iR2. The slow sub-system\ndescribes the behaviour of the high side and low side rectifier\noutputs and the capacitive output filters and loads, vc'p and VCP2\nbeing considered to be the inputs to the high side and low side\noutput sub-systems, respectively.\nCs\nCs i.s Ls ULis\nA\nBC3 -B2\n0 0 0 0 0 a 13\naio\na10\na12\n0 0 100 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 a11\na1o\n0 0 O 0 1 0\nc = [0o' l] ; D\nb0 L L L2 b I=L C+ b12 CC\np2 pI pI p2\na10 L LIs1LIs2 +LsL L1S2 +LspLL +LspLL2\nLsLsi LsLsi LsL p LsL p L1SILl2 LpLls2 LpLsi LpLsi L pLls2a=L + + + + + + + p +\nCp2 Cpl Cp2 Cpl Cs Cs Cs Cp2 Cpl\na1 L LIS1+ LIS+ + + +\nP CP2 C Ci 2 CSC CSC CSC C CPi p2p2 ~P1 p2 PI UPIUp2\nb=sL b LpLls LSL bi20 LJpLls2 i21 = PC + C 22CS CP2\nAdding the state vectors yields,\n- ViRl]\nX1 + X'2 + X'3 = A, (Xl + X2 + X3 )+ [B,I B,2 B,3 ] 'RI\n_iR2 _\nL 11r | L\nLpiLp--i.1.NJ lcp11r A Cp2 - 1\ng t SA#- rw1c\" F i1 \/ -~ - Cn9 mI )\nNow, by defining, X= XI +X2 +X3\nY Y1+Y +Y3+ VLP\nstate-space equation simplifies to,\nthe observable canonical\ny I I2 _Z \\40 o m_ - V~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~in\nFig. 3 State-variable representation of the fast sub-system. x =A (xl + X2+ X3 ) + [Bo, Bo2 Bo3] iR\nL'R2j\nThe dynamics of the fast sub-system, therefore, consist of a set F 1\nof state-variables whose value at time t = to, together with the Y=VLP =Co(x1+x2 +x3)+[Dol 0 o] 'RIinput for all t > to, completely determines the behaviour of the LR2j\nsystem for any time t > to.

A ferrite core, 3F3,\nsuitable for high frequency applications, was used for both the\ntransformer core and the resonant inductor. Since the\ntransformer leakage inductances are dependent on the winding\narrangement, the secondaries were bifilar wound adjacent to\nthe core, beneath the primary winding, so as to reduce\nsecondary leakage flux.\nTABLE II\nPROTOTYPE DUAL OUTPUT CONVERTER COMPONENT VALUES\nParameter Value\nDC link input voltage, VDC (V) 15\nSeries resonant inductances, Ls (,uH) 0.85\nSeries resonant capacitances, Cs (,F) 1.5\nHigh side parallel resonant capacitances, C., (gF) 0.116\nLow side parallel resonant capacitances, CP2 (,F) 0.116\nLoad resistance, RL (Q) 4\nFilter capacitance, C1 (,F) 100\nMagnetising inductance, Lm (,uH) 109\nTransformer turns ratio 1\nTransformer output leakage inductance, Li, (,uH) 0.1\nTransformer primary leakage inductance, Li.

The effective series\ninductance comprises of the series inductor, Ls, and the\nprimary leakage inductance, LI,, and was measured as 1.55gH.\nA comparison of the output voltage obtained from the state\nvariable model, simulated to steady-state, with SPICE\nsimulation results and measurements, is given in Fig. 4. As is\nclearly evident, the correlation between the theoretical\npredictions and the experimental data is extremely good.\nMoreover, a comparison of simulated and measured\ncharacteristics, when duty-cycle ratio control is employed, has\nalso been obtained at an operating frequency of f=150 kHz.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 5 from which it can be seen that\nthe proposed state-variable model provides sufficient accuracy\nfor design and analysis purposes, the maximum error being\n<5%\/.\nVI. CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL\nThe structure of the control methodology, which employs two\ndecoupled feedback loops for independent control of frequency\nand duty-cycle ratio, is shown in Fig. 6. Parameters for the\ndecoupled SISO controllers are chosen for good transient\nresponse and disturbance rejection. The digital compensator is\ntuned to respond quickly to variations of V0,,,1 whilst the\ncontroller reacting to variations of V0,12, acts relatively slowly,\nthereby allowing an effective decoupling of the control loops,\nfor simplicity. The prototype converter controller is shown in\nFig. 7. The converter (see Table II for parameters) is required\nto provide regulated +5V and +3.3V outputs from a DC link\ninput voltage in the range 15V to 20V. Figure 8 shows the\nsteady-state error between the reference voltages, Vrefl and\nVrej2, and the resulting measured output voltages of the\nconverter, over the specified range of DC link input voltages\n(I5V to 20V) with a 5Q load.\n}1\n-2\n160 180 200 220 240 260 280\nFrequency (kHz)\nFig. 4 Output voltage vs switching frequency\nI\nT\n4j5\n345\non 35 40f 45 5f 5i9\nDuV %N)\n60 65 T7\n(b)\nFig. 5 Control characteristic curves forfi=150 kHz (a) high side\noutput, and (b) low side output.\nTwo degee\nfreedom controler\nFig. 6 Closed-loop control of the dual-load converter.\n149\n-Vut2 =33V\no , L i L- -O O.CX F 0.01 0.015 0.02 O.CE5 0.03 0.035 0.01 0.015\nline(s)\n(a)\n61:'\nFig. 7 Digital control of dual-output converter.\n5.2\nX X,\n\",8 Ak*refl 0\n4B6 Ooeratingroont-\n> frequency 1 61kHz\nID 4A4 23% ducyct e\n4 ...a\nOperatig pbit.\nfrequency 156kHz\n20% duty cycle3.6\n4A\n1O 151 17 75 181 5 1 195 20\nDC Inputyoltaeg (V)\nFig. 8 Output voltage regulation vs. input voltage\nIt can be seen that the maximum regulation error for both\noutputs is <5%. Finally, Fig. 9 shows the response of the\nconverter resulting from transient start-up conditions, for a\nrange of applied input voltages and dual output voltage ratios.\nIt can be seen that the converter voltages converge rapidly to\nthe reference values, with an initial overshoot of 10%,\ncorresponding to an equivalent 2nd_order damping ratio of\n4-0.6.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nThe characteristics of dual-load, 4t-order LCLC voltage-\noutput resonant converters, have been explored. From the\noutput voltage distribution derived from an example converter,\nthe impact of the converter design parameters, and output\nleakage inductance, on the attainable output voltage ratio, has\nbeen investigated. A comparison of measurements from an\nexperimental converter, capable of delivering 5V and 3.3V,\nwith predictions from the derived state-variable model and\nSPICE simulations, shows that the state-variable model\nprovides accurate predictions of output voltage under steady-\nstate conditions. Moreover, a basic control scheme to allow\nreliable regulation of both outputs, has been realised, with\nsteady-state measurements showing independent regulation\nusing a combination of duty-cycle and frequency control, and\ngood start-up transient behaviour on both outputs under a range\nof operating conditions.\nV.,t,= 5V\nV.ut2 = 3.3V\no O.OC)5 0.01 0.015 0.2O.C 20 O.CB 0.08 0.04 O.CH5\nTine(s)\n(b)\nFig. 9 Start-up transient response for various dual output voltage ratios and\nDC-link input voltages (a) VDc-l5V, V0Utl=5V, V0Ut2=3.3V; (b) VDc-20V,\nV01tl=5V, V0.t2=3.3V\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
