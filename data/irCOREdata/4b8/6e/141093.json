Optimum growth was at 35\u00b0C. At each temperature \nstudied, growth increased from 0.90 to 0.99 aw. Temperatures of 17 and 42\u00b0C only \nsupported marginal growth. The external conditions had a differential effect on aflatoxin B1 \nor G1 biosynthesis. The temperature optima of aflatoxin B1 and G1 were not at the \ntemperature which supported optimal growth (35\u00b0C) but either below (aflatoxin G1, 20\u2013\n30\u00b0C) or above (aflatoxin B1, 37\u00b0C). Interestingly, the expression of the two regulatory genes \naflR and aflS showed an expression profile which corresponded to the biosynthesis profile of \neither B1 (aflR) or G1 (aflS). The ratios of the expression data between aflS:aflR were \ncalculated. High ratios at a range between 17 and 30\u00b0C corresponded with the production \nprofile of aflatoxin G1 biosynthesis. A low ratio was observed at >30\u00b0C, which was related to \naflatoxin B1 biosynthesis. The results revealed that the temperature was the key parameter \nfor aflatoxin B1, whereas it was water activity for G1 biosynthesis. These differences in \nregulation may be attributed to variable conditions of the ecological niche in which these \nspecies occur. \n \nIntroduction \n \nAflatoxins are toxic metabolites formed predominately by two agronomically important \nfungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. A. flavus produces mainly aflatoxin B1 and B2 \nwhereas A. parasiticus forms the 4 aflatoxins, B1, B2, G1 and G2. Generally, A. parasiticus \nproduces high concentrations of aflatoxin, and most of the strains isolated from natural \nhabitats (>90%) are able to synthesize aflatoxins. In contrast, only 40\u201350% of the A. flavus \nisolates are capable of forming the toxin (Bennett and Christensen 1983). The aflatoxin \nbiosynthesis gene cluster has been described (Yu et al. 2004). The structural genes are \nregulated by the transcription factor aflR and the accessory regulatory gene aflS (Chang \n2003). The habitats of both species overlap, but distinct differences are obvious. The habitat \n2 \n \nof A. flavus is broader because of being found not only on cereals especially wheat but also \non peanuts, tree nuts or high sugar-containing dry fruits. \n \nBoth species can also be found in soils; however, this is the predominant ecological niche for \nA. parasiticus. Both species occur in subtropical and tropical regions. According to Pitt and \nHocking (1999), A. parasiticus is endemic in soil-borne peanuts, and they found more A. \nparasiticus than A. flavus strains in Australian peanuts. This situation is the opposite in \nmaize, which is more susceptible to A. flavus compared to A. parasiticus. Pitt and Hocking \n(1999) also described intriguing differences in the geographical occurrence of both species. \nAccording to their data, A. parasiticus can only occasionally be found in southeast Asia, but \nit is widely distributed in soils and foodstuffs in the United States, Latin America, South \nAfrica, India and Australia. This specific geographical distribution is not known for A. flavus, \nindicating that A. flavus may be a more aggressive and more widely distributed species \nwhen compared to A. parasiticus. Recently, the occurrence of A. flavus was described in \ncereals from north Italy (Giorni et al. 2007) in 2004 and 2005 because of hot dry summer \nweather. This resulted in significant contamination with aflatoxins. This demonstrates that \nthe ecological distribution of these species is significantly impacted by fluctuations and \ntrends in regional climatic changes. These ecological differences might also be reflected not \nonly by differences in the formation of the aflatoxin structural types B and G but also in the \nregulation of the biosynthesis of the aflatoxins in response to environmental parameters \nlike temperature and aw. In a recent study, the influence of both parameters on aflatoxin B1 \ngene expression and phenotypic production by A. flavus was analysed (Schmidt-Heydt et al. \n2009), and it could be shown that aw was the leading parameter. At moderate \ntemperatures (25\u201330\u00b0C), high aw levels (0.95\u20130.99) induced aflatoxin B1 production which is \nin agreement with other data. According to Bhatnagar et al. (2006), aflatoxin biosynthesis in \nA. flavus is optimal at temperatures between 29 and 30\u00b0C, but it is significantly decreased at \ntemperatures <25\u00b0C and \u226537\u00b0C (O\u2019Brian et al. 2007).  \n \nNot much information about the mutual regulation of aflatoxin B1 and G1 in A. parasiticus is \nknown at present. In order to understand this aspect, a detailed analysis of the regulation of \naflatoxin B1 and G1 biosynthesis in A. parasiticus under different combinations of \ntemperature and aw has been carried out. A further objective was to analyse the effect of \nthese environmental parameters on the expression of the aflatoxin-specific regulatory \ngenes (aflS, aflR) and their ratio. \n \nMaterials and methods \nStrains and growth conditions \n \nA. parasiticus, BFE96p produces the B and G group aflatoxins when grown under permissive \nconditions. This strain forms high concentrations of aflatoxin after growth on YES agar (20 \ng\/l yeast extract, 150 g\/l sucrose, 15 g\/l agar) at 25\u201330\u00b0C for 5 days. For expression and \ntoxin analysis, the agar plates were overlayed with sterile 8.5 cellophane sheets (P400; \nCannings, Bristol, U.K.) and then single point inoculated centrally by applying 10 \u03bcl of a \nspore suspension of 107 spores in TWS (0.5% tween 80, 0.85 g\/l NaCl). The aw of the media \nwas adjusted with glycerol by using glycerol\/water mixtures. The following amounts were \nused per litre (10.8 ml, 0.99; 13.1 ml, 0.98; 19.9 ml, 0.95; 24.5 ml, 0.93; and 31.3 ml, 0.90). \nThe water activity of the medium was verified by using an Aqua Lab Lite water activity meter \n3 \n \n(Graintec, Toowoomba, Australia). The plates were inoculated at the temperature indicated \n(15\u201342\u00b0C).  \n \n \n \nGrowth assessment \n \nFor measurement of the diametric mycelial growth rate, the diameter of the colony was \nmeasured in two directions at right angles to each other. The increase in colony radius was \nplotted and the linear regression lines for the linear phase were used to obtain the relative \ngrowth rates (cm\/7 days). The biomass was removed from the cellophane surface for \nextraction and molecular as well as aflatoxin analysis. All experiments were carried out with \n3\u20134 replicates and some temperature treatments were repeated for confirmation of results.  \n \nIsolation of RNA from samples and transcription in cDNA \n \nTo perform Real-Time PCR gene expression analysis, RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy \nPlant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). An amount of 1 g of the mycelium was ground \nwith a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. About 250 mg of the resulting powder was used \nfor isolation of total RNA. The powder was resuspended in 750 \u03bcl lysis buffer, mixed with 7.5 \n\u03bcl \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 100 glass beads with a diameter of 1 mm (B. Braun Biotech, \nMelsungen, Germany) in a 2-ml RNase free micro reaction tube. The extracts were mixed \nthoroughly and incubated for 15 min at 55\u00b0C and 42 kHz in an S10H ultrasonic bath (Elma, \nSingen, Germany). All further procedures were essentially the same as recommended by the \nmanufacturer of the kit. For cDNA synthesis, 12 \u03bcl of the DNase I-treated total RNA were \nused along with the Omniscript Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). The reaction mixture was \ncomposed essentially as described by the manufacturer and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The \ncDNA was either directly used for Real-Time PCR or stored at \u221280\u00b0C. \n \nQuantification of aflatoxin B1 and G1 by HPLC\/MS\/MS \n \nDetection and quantitative determination of aflatoxin B1 and G1 from fungal colonies were \nperformed according to the following method: 100 mg of the fungal colony were extracted \nunder shaking conditions in 500 \u03bcl chloroform at room temperature for 30 min. The \nresidues were discarded and the chloroform was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum \nconcentrator (Speed Vac; Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, USA). The residues were then \nredissolved in 200 \u03bcl methanol and 20 \u03bcl were subjected to HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was \nperformed on a 1200 series HPLC system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany), equipped with a \ndegaser, a binary pump system, an autosampler and a column oven. The sample was \ninjected into a Prontosil reversed-phase column (150 mm\u00d74 mm, 3 \u03bcm particle size; \nBischoff, Leonberg, Germany). The mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and \nacetonitrile. A linear gradient of formic acid from 30% to 0% in 9 min and a 21-min isocratic \nelution at 0% was employed. The flow rate was set to 0.8 ml\/min. The autosampler was \ncooled to 10\u00b0C, whereas the column oven was heated to 25\u00b0C. \n \nThe HPLC system was directly coupled to a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass \nspectrometer (3200 QTrap; Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany), equipped with a \n4 \n \nTurboIonSpray source. The analytes were detected in the positive ion mode at a vaporiser \ntemperature of 650\u00b0C and an ion spray voltage of 5,500 kV. Spectral data were recorded \nwith N2 as curtain and collision gas, at 50 psi and medium, respectively. Data acquisition \nwas performed in the MRM mode monitoring the transition of m\/z 313 in Q1 to m\/z 285 in \nQ3 as qualifier and to m\/z 241 in Q3 as quantifier for aflatoxin B1. The collision offset \nenergies were 31 and 49 V, respectively, and the declustering potential 76 V. The \ncorresponding transitions m\/z 329\u2192 m\/z 115 and m\/z 329\u2192m\/z 243 were monitored for \naflatoxin G1 at a declustering potential of 66 V and collision offset energy of 91 and 39 V, \nrespectively. \n \nQuantification of aflatoxin B1 and G1 was performed using commercially available reference \ncompounds. Calibration curves were constructed in the range of 0.1\u2013100 ng\/mL in which \nthe linearity of the response was given. \n \nReal-Time PCR \n \nThe Real-Time PCR reactions were performed in a GeneAmp 5700\u00ae Sequence Detection \nSystem (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The SYBR green approach was used. The \noptimal primers and the internal probe used in the reaction were identified within the \naflR_AP (AP=A. parasiticus) with respect to the aflS_AP gene by Primer Express 1.0 software \n(PE Applied Biosystems). The primer sets for the standard curves to perform absolute \nquantifications had the following nucleotide sequences: aflR_AP_for (5\u2032 - gcc gcc gtt gag gta \ncac tg-3\u2032 ) and aflR_AP_rev (5\u2032 - cga acg tgg tct tgc ctg tc-3\u2032 ); aflS_AP_for (5\u2032 -cgt cac cgg ggc \natg tg-3\u2032 ) and aflS_AP_rev (5\u2032 -gcg cgg cgt cca tcg-3\u2032 ). The concentration of these standard \nPCR products was determined in a fluorometer (DNA Quant 200; Pharmacia, Uppsala, \nSweden) and the number of copies was calculated. These stock solutions were diluted \nserially by a factor of 10 and an aliquot of the dilutions was used as a copy number standard \nduring each setup of the Real-Time PCR reaction. The concentration of unknown samples \nwas calculated by the GeneAmp 5700\u00ae system according to the generated standard curve.  \n \nFor the PCR reaction, the SYBR Green Reagent kit (Eurogentec, Liege, Belgium) was used \naccording to the recommendations of the manufacturer. After an activation step of 10 min \nat 95\u00b0C, all subsequent 40 PCR cycles were performed according to the following \ntemperature regime: 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 40 s. The primer pairs to \ngenerate aflR- and aflS-specific internal gene fragments for SYBR Green fluorescence \nmeasurement had the following sequences: aflR_SYBR_for (5\u2032 -ggt ccc cac ttc caa aaa cg-3\u2032 ) \nand aflR_SYBR_rev- 3_rev (5\u2032 -gct ggt cag gcg caa agc-3\u2032 ), aflS_SYBR_for (5\u2032 -cgg atg aac tgg \ncaa aac ttg-3\u2032 ) and aflS_SYBR_rev (5\u2032 -gca ggt atg cca tga tta tcg-3\u2032 ).  \n \nResults  \n \nInfluence of water activity \u00d7 temperature interactions on growth of A. parasiticus  \n \nThe influence of various combinations of aw levels and temperature on growth of A. \nparasiticus is shown in Fig. 1. This strain of A. parasiticus displayed a growth optimum at \n35\u00b0C. The colony diameter was strongly dependent on the aw treatment. The fastest growth \nwas observed at the highest aw level examined (0.99 aw). When aw was decreased there \n5 \n \nwas a gradual decrease in growth although the optimum remained at 35\u00b0C. At 0.90 aw, \ngrowth was very slow and only observable between 30 and 37\u00b0C.  \n \nInfluence of water activity \u00d7 temperature interactions on aflatoxin B1 and G1 biosynthesis  \n \nThe same samples which were used for the growth measurement were analysed using LC-\nMS\/MS to quantify the amount of aflatoxin B1 and G1 produced under these interacting \nconditions (Fig. 2). There were different optima for production profiles of the two structural \nforms of aflatoxin. A. parasiticus formed high amounts of aflatoxin B1 at >30\u00b0C, with an \noptimum at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 2a). At temperatures between 30 and 37\u00b0C, biosynthesis of aflatoxin \nB1 appeared to be independent of aw as long as it was above 0.90. However, at lower \ntemperatures (e.g. 20 and 25\u00b0C), aw seemed to play an influential role. Under these \nconditions, aflatoxin B1 was formed in higher amounts at higher aw levels (0.98\u20130.99 aw). At \ntemperatures >37\u00b0C, the biosynthesis of aflatoxin B1 decreased sharply. In contrast, aw \nseems to be important for the optimum production of aflatoxin G1. Large amounts of \naflatoxin G1 were produced at aw 0.99 and 0.98 irrespective of the temperature in a range \nbetween 20 and 30\u00b0C (Fig. 2b). At temperatures above 30 and below 17\u00b0C, aflatoxin G1 \nproduction drops sharply.  \n \nRelationship between aflR and aflS expression to the biosynthesis of aflatoxin B1 and G1  \n \nBecause it has been shown previously that the expression level of aflR and aflS is related to \naflatoxin B1 biosynthesis in A. flavus (Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2009), the expression levels of \nboth genes of A. parasiticus were also analysed by Real-Time PCR for the quantification of \naflatoxins from the same cultures used for the growth experiments. Surprisingly, the two \nregulatory genes behaved differently. The expression of the aflR gene tended to be higher at \nconditions \u226530\u00b0C (Fig. 3a), whereas the aflS gene expression was higher at conditions \u226430\u00b0C \n(Fig. 3b). This corresponded with the production profile of aflatoxin G1 (aflS) or aflatoxin B1 \n(aflR). Generally, the absolute expression of aflS was higher than that of aflR. The \nnormalised ratio of aflS:aflR expression is shown in Fig. 3c. This ratio was high at conditions \n<30\u00b0C, which is within the temperature range optimal for aflatoxin G1 biosynthesis. At \ntemperatures >30\u00b0C, supportive for aflatoxin B1 formation, the ratio was low. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe influence of aw \u00d7 temperature interactions on growth and the biosynthesis of aflatoxin \nwas investigated in this study. Various ecophysiological studies with A. flavus (Sorensen et \nal. 1967; Gqaleni et al. 1997; O\u2019Brian et al. 2007; Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2009) have been \ndone, but much less information is available for A. parasiticus (Lin et al. 1980; Faraj et al. \n1991; Park and Bullerman 1981). The strain of A. parasiticus examined here showed a clear \ngrowth responsiveness to interacting aw \u00d7 temperature conditions. Freely available water \n(0.99 aw) supported growth at almost all temperatures examined. A clear optimum for \ngrowth was found at 35\u00b0C, regardless of aw level. A very similar growth surface response \ncurve for A. parasiticus in relation to changes in aw and temperature was shown by \nSamapundo et al. (2007), although they found an optimum of 30\u00b0C for their strain of A. \nparasiticus. For A.flavus, previous studies have shown a siilar influence of these parameters \non growth behaviour with an optimum at 30\u00b0C (Samapundo et al. 2007; Schmidt-Heydt et al. \n6 \n \n2009). This suggested that, apparently, growth regulation in response to aw and \ntemperature is similar in both species.  \n \nThe optimum conditions for biosynthesis of aflatoxins B1 and G1 in A. parasiticus differed. \nInterestingly, optimal conditions for both did not coincide with the growth optimum (35\u00b0C), \nbut was either below (G1) or above (B1). Aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis was independent of aw \nat certain temperatures as long as the aw was >0.90. In contrast, the optimum production of \naflatoxin G1 was more dependent on aw than from temperature in the range 20\u201330\u00b0C. This \nshift between optimum production and optimum growth has further been observed for \nochratoxin production by Penicillium verrucosum, trichothecene production by F. culmorum \n(Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2008) or for fumonisin production by F. verticillioides (Jurado et al. \n2008). A difference in the temperature optima between aflatoxin B1 and G1 was previously \nfound by Lin et al. (1980). They analysed the influence of cycling temperatures on aflatoxin \nB1 and G1 biosynthesis in A. parasiticus and found that more G1 is formed at lower \ntemperatures, e.g. after cycling between 15 and 25\u00b0C, whereas more B1 is produced after \ncycling between 15 and 33\u00b0C. This is in agreement with the data reported here and shows \nthe different temperature regulation of the B versus the G aflatoxins.  \n \nThe expression profiles of the two regulatory genes at the different combinations of aw and \ntemperature showed a relationship with the production profiles of the two different \naflatoxin types produced. Both genes were highly expressed at 30\u00b0C. At this temperature, \nmoderate to large amounts of both aflatoxins B1 and G1 were formed. Depending on the \ntemperature, the expression of aflS or aflR changes. The aflR gene was expressed at higher \nlevels at >30\u00b0C, whereas the most prominent expression of the aflS gene was at <30\u00b0C. This \ncorresponded with the production profile of either aflatoxin B1 (prominent above 30\u00b0C) or \nG1 (prominent below 30\u00b0C). When a quotient between the normalised expression data of \nthe aflS:aflR genes was generated, high ratios could be found at temperatures <30\u00b0C. This is \nin agreement with the aflatoxin G1 production profile. In a recent study of A. flavus \n(Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2009), it was demonstrated that the ratio between aflS and aflR \nexpression seems to be an indicator for the activation of aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis. In the \ncurrent study, a high ratio indicated a high biosynthesis of aflatoxin G1. Interestingly, high \nproduction of aflatoxin G1 in A. parasiticus occurs under similar conditions (moderate \ntemperatures 20\u201330\u00b0C, high aw of 0.99) as high aflatoxin B1 production in A. flavus \n(Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2009). \n \nThe products of both the aflR and aflS genes are regulatory proteins. AFLR is a transcription \nfactor which directly binds to a consensus sequence in front of the aflatoxin structural genes \n(Ehrlich and Cary 1995; Ehrlich et al. 1999). The activity of the aflS gene on the other hand \nis not absolutely clear. It is not a DNA binding protein; however, according to Chang (2003), \nit interacts with aflR and somehow supports DNA binding by the latter. Ehrlich (2009) \nrecently discussed that aflS may interact with the global secondary metabolite regulatory \nfactor laeA. According to a recent analysis of Du et al. (2007), aflS appears to modulate the \nactivity of aflR. This activity would coincide with the results reported in the present study. \nAssuming that the expression of the regulatory genes aflR and aflS is directly correlated to \nthe amount of gene products, the regulation of aflatoxin B1 or G1 seems to be dependent \non the ratio of the transcription of the regulatory genes. The aflS\/aflR ratio is high under \nconditions which favour high aflatoxin G1 biosynthesis. As a modulator, aflS may influence \n7 \n \nthe activity of aflR. In the case of A. parasiticus, this modulation may shift the affinity of aflR \ntowards the G-group-specific genes, ordA, cypA and nadA (Cai et al. 2008) and activate their \nexpression under these conditions. \n \nThis differential production of aflatoxin B1 and G1 surely has an ecological function and may \nbe an adaptation of A. parasiticus to a similar but slightly different habitat compared to A. \nflavus (Magan and Aldred 2007a, b). The differentially produced amounts of either aflatoxin \nB1 or G1 under various environmental conditions is obviously attributable to the adaptation \nto changing environments. It has been demonstrated that mycotoxins can be one method \nby which ecological advantage can be obtained by species to improve their competitiveness \nunder fluctuating environmental conditions (Magan and Aldred 2007a, b). \n \n \nAcknowledgement  \nWe would like to thank Katja Kramer and Sabine H\u00e4ckel for excellent technical assistance. \nThis work was supported by the EU project EC KBBE-2007-222690-2 MYCORED. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBennett JW, Christensen SB (1983) New perspectives on aflatoxin biosynthesis.
