Theoretical and empirical research should focus on what differentiates \nhuman sociality from that of other primates. That is the fact that members of society \noften act towards each other in terms of essentialised roles and groups. These have a \nphenomenological existence that is not based on everyday empirical monitoring but \non imagined statuses and imagined communities such as clans or nations. The \nneurological basis for this type of social, which includes religion, will therefore \ndepend on the development of imagination. It is suggested that such a development of \nimagination occurred at about the time of the upper palaeolithic \u201crevolution\u201d. \n \n \n \nThis paper reconsiders how we should approach the study of the evolution of religion. \nThe discussion leads me, however, to a more general consideration of the way social \ncognition has been approached in recent literature.  This reconsideration bears in mind \nthe kind of problems that Colin Renfrew has called the \u201csapient paradox\u201d.   The paper \nproposes a cognitively and neurologically more probable scenario for the \ndevelopment of religion than certain recent theories that are questioned by the \nproblems he highlights. \n  \n \nThe problems I am referring to are particularly thrown into focus by a series of \ntheories that originate in Sperber\u2019s suggestion that religious-like beliefs are to be \naccounted for by a subtle mix of intuitive human capacities based on evolved \nneurological modules, and certain, very limited, representations that, because they go \nagainst the core knowledge that the modules suggest, are therefore \u201ccounter-\nintuitive\u201d, therefore \u201cintriguing\u201d (Sperber: 1985).  The motivation for these theories is \nto seek an answer to a question. How could a sensible animal like modern Homo \nsapiens, equipped by natural selection with efficient core knowledge (or modular \npredispositions), that is knowledge well suited for dealing with the world as it is, hold \nsuch ridiculous ideas as: there are Ghosts that go through walls, there exist omniscient \ns and there are deceased people active after death?  The authors who hold such a \ntheory of religion give the following answers to this question.  First, our core \nknowledge ensures that, however bizarre such ideas might seem at first, when they are \nmore closely examined, they, in fact, turn out to be mainly disappointingly intuitive.  \nSecondly, even though beliefs in supernatural things nevertheless do involve a few \ncounter-intuitive aspects, if only by definition, these are possible because of \n 1\naccidental misapplications of core knowledge to domains for which it is not designed.  \nThese limited misapplications are, however, so alluring that they make these \nminimally counter-intuitive beliefs spread like wildfire. They thus become key \nelements in religions (e.g. Boyer 1994: 2001, Pyysiainen: 2001). \n \nThe problems with these theories that I shall discuss here do not necessarily imply \noutright rejection. They are what might be called \u201cup stream\u201d objections since   they \noccur even before we consider the main proposals.  The first objection echoes a \nsimilar one long ago made by Durkheim but it has been reformulated more recently \nby Justin Barrett (2004) when he points out that it is odd to account for such a central \nphenomena in the history of mankind as religion in terms of minor cognitive \nmalfunctions.  My second objection is that those who propose such theories forget the \nfact that anthropologists have, after countless fruitless attempts, found it impossible to \nusefully and convincingly cross-culturally isolate or define a distinct phenomenon that \ncan analytically be labelled \u201creligion\u201d.i  The third problem with such theories is that \nthey explain \u201creligion\u201d as a product of core knowledge or modular capacities, such as \nna\u00efve physics, number, na\u00efve biology and na\u00efve psychology, all of which, with the \npossible exception of the last, we share with all our anthropoid relatives. Such a \nproposal is therefore unconvincing simply because no other animal than humans \nmanifests any behaviour that is remotely like what is usually called \u201creligion\u201d.  This \nlack seems to also be the case for all hominids or hominims, apart from post upper \npalaeolithic modern Sapiens. In other words, the explanations that I am challenging \naccount for a highly specific and general characteristic of modern Humans, what they \ncall \u201creligion\u201d, by general factors that have existed for millions of years before the \nupper palaeolithic revolution when the phenomenon first manifested itself. \n \n \nThe alternative story I propose here avoids these problems.  It argues that religious-\nlike phenomena in general are an inseparable part of a key adaptation unique to \nmodern humans. This is the capacity to imagine other worlds, an adaptation that, I \nshall argue is the very foundation of the sociality of modern human society. This \nneurological adaptation occurred most probably only fully developed around the time \nof the upper palaeolithic revolution. \n \nThe transactional and the transcendental. \n \nFor heuristic reasons, a consideration of Chimpanzee society can serve as a starting \npoint.  I turn towards our nearest surviving relatives in order to stress, as is so often \nthe case in the evolutionary literature, a major difference between them and us.  Of \ncourse, we cannot assume that contemporary Chimpanzee social organisation is \nnecessarily like that of early Sapiens.  There is no way to know; especially since the \nsocial organisation of the two extant species of chimpanzees are radically different \nthough both are equally closely, or equally remotely, related to us.  In this case it is \nnot similarity but difference that is revealing and this difference provides us with \nsomething like a thought experiment that enables us to reflect on certain \ncharacteristics of human society.  \n \nChimpanzees do not have anything which remotely resembles the many and varied \nphenomena which have been labelled religion in anthropology.  Indeed this was \nprobably also true of early Sapiens.  But, more importantly, there is also something \n 2\nelse that Chimpanzees, and probably early Sapiens, do not have. This is social roles or \nsocial groups, understood in one particular sense of the word social. \n \nOf course chimpanzee social organisation is highly complex.  For example, the \ndominant animal is not necessarily the biggest or the one who can hit hardest.  \nDominance seems to be achieved as much by Machiavellian politicking as it is by \nbiting.  Secondly, chimpanzees do create long lasting coalitions, often of females, and \nthese may well dominate the social organisation of the group (de Waal: 2000). Such \nroles and groupings are of a type that I call here the transactional social.  This is \nbecause such roles and groups are the product of a process of continual manipulation, \nassertions and defeats. This type of social is also found in modern humans. \n \nHowever, what the chimps do not have is the kind of phenomenon that used to be \nreferred to as  \u201csocial structure\u201d in the heyday of British social anthropology \n(Radcliffe-Brown: 1952). This I shall label here the transcendental social.  The \ntranscendental social consists of essentialised roles and essentialised groups. \n \nEssentialised roles exist separately from the individual who holds them. Rights and \nduties apply to the role and not to the individual.  Thus a person who is a professor \nshould act \u201cas a professor\u201d irrespective of the kind of person she is at any particular \nstage in the transactional social game.  Similarly, in central Madagascar, as a younger \nbrother, I should walk behind my older brother; as a woman I should not raise my \nvoice in a mixed gathering. All this applies, however powerful I have actually \nbecome, even if my prestige is greater than that of my older brother or of a man  \n \nEssentialised groups exist in the sense that a descent group or a nation exists.  These \ngroups have phenomenal existence not because the members of the descent group or \nthe nation are doing certain kinds of thing together at particular moments, or because \nthey have been together doing certain kind of things at particular moments in the \nsufficiently recent past so that it is reasonable to assume that they retain the capacity \nto behave now in similar ways.  One can be a member of an essentialised \ntranscendental group, or a nation, even though one never comes in contact with the \nother members of the descent group or the nation. One can accept that others are \nmembers of such groups irrespective of the kind of relationship one has had with them \nor that one can suppose one is likely to have with them. Such groups are, to use \nBenedict Anderson\u2019s phrase, \u201cimagined communities\u201d  (Andersen: 1983).  \n \nAs noted above, in stressing the system of essentialised roles and groups I am \nemphasising what British social anthropologists, such as Radcliffe-Brown, were \nreferring to when they spoke of \u201csocial structure\u201d. However, my position is \ntheoretically very different from theirs.  For them the human social was equated with \nthe network of such roles and groups. For me these phenomena are only a part of the \nsocial: they are the transcendental social.  \n \nThe transcendental social is not all there is to human sociality.  There is plenty of \ntransactional social in human sociality that occurs side by side, or in combination \nwith, the transcendental social.  The transactional social exists irrespective of the \nrole-like essentialised statuses and the essentialised groups of the transcendental \nsocial though it may use the existence of the transcendental social as one of the many \ncounters used in the transactional game. Human sociality is thus, as Durkheim \n 3\nstressed, double. It has its transactional elements and its transcendental element. \nChimpanzee sociality, by contrast, is single because the transcendental social does not \nexist among the chimpanzees. \n \nThe double character of the human social can be illustrated by the example of a \nMalagasy village elder I have known for a long time.  By now, he is old, physically \nweak and a little bit senile. He has difficulty in recognising people.  He spends most \nof his days in a foetal position wrapped up in a blanket.  Yet he is treated with \ncontinual deference, consideration, respect and even fear.  Whenever there is a ritual \nto be performed he has to be put in charge so that he can bless the participants.   When \nhe is treated with great respect he is being behaved to, and he accordingly behaves \ntowards others as a transcendental elder. This does not mean, however, that he is not \nalso within the transactional social system.  While as a transcendental elder he is \nlittle different to what he was when he was in his prime several years ago, as a \ntransactional player he has lost out completely in the machiavellian game of influence \nand nobody takes much notice of him anymore or of his opinions since in the \ncontinual power play of daily life he has become insignificant. \n \nThis kind of duality is impossible in Chimpanzee society.  There, once you are weak \nor, have lost out in the continual wheeling and dealings of power you lose previous \nstatus.  In an instant, a dominant animal is replaced in his role (De Waal 2000). \nChimpanzee rank depends entirely on what those you interact with believe you can do \nnext.  Chimpanzees do pay respect to each other in all sorts of ways\u2026 for instance, \nbowing to a dominant animal, but, once this animal has lost out in the power game, \nthis behaviour stops instantly.  A social position in chimpanzee society never \ntranscends the predictable achievements of the individual. This absence of \ntranscendental roles is where the fundamental difference between chimpanzee and \nhuman sociability lies.  The Malagasy in the village where this elder lives bow to him \njust as much now that he is weak as they ever did, even though he has become \nobviously without transactional influence. It is important to remember however, that \nthe respect shown him does not mean that he is an elder all the time.  The people, who \ninteract with him, and probably himself, represent him in two ways.  These two ways \nare not experienced as contradictory but they are clearly distinguished and made \nvisible by the behaviour of all concerned.  Everybody knows that he is a weak old \nman whose hands shake and whose memory is going and people sometimes behave \ntowards him in terms of that representation, even with occasional cruelty. They also \nbehave towards him in terms of the respect described above.  Thus he belongs to two \nnetworks and, although the two are different, the transcendental network is taken into \naccount in the transactional network while the transactional network affects the \ntranscendental network only indirectly; for example, when another person is \nultimately able to replace an elder in his transcendental role through revolutionary \nmanipulation (For example in a traditional African society, convincing people that he \nis a witch (Middleton: 1960)).  \n \nIn order to fully understand the role of an elder such as the one I have in mind, it is \nessential also to remember that, as a transcendental being, he is part of something that \nappears as a system, even though this sytematicity may be something of an illusion.   \nThe transcendental elder implies the existence of transcendental juniors, of \ntranscendental affines, transcendental grandchildren, etc.   The transcendental network \ninvolves gender roles, thereby creating transcendental women and men. It is a system \n 4\nof interrelated roles and it is this complex of inter-relations at the transcendental level \nthat most critically distinguishes the human social from the sociality of other species.  \n \nThis transcendental network also includes what the structural functionalists called \n\u201ccorporate groups\u201d but which I have referred to above as essentialised groups.  These \nare transcendental groups.  By this I mean that, for example, members of a clan are \ndual. At the transactional level they differ from each other just as much, or just as \nlittle as they do from people of the next clan.  But, in the transcendental social mode, \nall members of such a group are identical as transcendental members.  They are, as is \noften said; \u201cone body\u201d.  As \u201cone body\u201d they differ absolutely, and all in the same \nway, from those others in the other clan.  The transcendental character of such groups \nis made all the more evident when we realise that the composition of such groups, \nwhether they be clans or nations, may equally include the living and the dead. Thus, \nwhen in the transcendental \u201cone body\u201d mode, members can make such bizarre \nstatements as \u201cWe came to this country two hundred years ago\u201d.  The transcendental \ncan thus negate the empirically based transactional in which people do not live for \ntwo hundred years.  Thus, the transactional social can as much ignore the present \nphysical state of an elder as it can ignore death and individuality.  The transcendental \nnetwork can with no problem include the dead, ancestors and gods as well as living \nrole holders and members of essentialised groups.  Ancestors and gods are compatible \nwith living elders or members of nations because all are equally mysterious invisible, \nin other words: transcendental.  \n \nThe transcendental social and \u201creligion\u201d.  \n \nThis social indissoluble unity between the living and the dead and between what is \noften called the \u201creligious\u201d and what is often called the \u201csocial\u201d has never been better \nexplained than in a famous article by Igor Kopytoff \u201cAncestors as Elders in Africa\u201d \n(Kopytoff 1971).  Although the article is phrased as a criticism of earlier work by \nFortes it actually follows the latter author closely.  Kopytoff points out how in many \nAfrican languages the same word is used for living elders and for dead ancestors who, \nit has often been said in the literature, Africans \u201cworship\u201d.  This is because in a sense, \nin the transcendental sense, they are the same kind of beings.  Kopytoff stresses how \nboth ancestors and elders have much the same powers of blessing and cursing.  This \nleads him to assert that, to talk of \u201cancestor worship\u201d, and thereby to suggest \nsomething analogous to an Abrahamic notion of a distinction between material beings \nand spiritual beings, is an ethnocentric representation which imposes our categorical \nopposition between the natural and the supernatural, or between the \u201creal\u201d and the \n\u201creligious\u201d, onto people for whom the contrast does not exist. \n \nI accept much of Kopytoff\u2019s and Fortes\u2019 argument and I want to expand it.  What \nmatters here, is that, if they are right there is no reason why we can\u2019t reverse his \nargument, something that Kopytoff himself suggests.  If dead ancestors, in an \n\u201cancestor worshiping society\u201d are the same ontological phenomena as elders, then \nelders have the same ontological status as ancestors.  If there is a type of phenomena \nthat merits the appellation \u201cancestor worship\u201d, which suggests the kind of things that \nhave often been called \u201creligion\u201d, then there is also elder worship or elder \u201creligion\u201d.  \nAnd since elders are part of a system, there is, in the traditional way the term has been \nused, junior \u201creligion\u201d, descent group \u201creligion\u201d, man \u201creligion\u201d, woman \u201creligion\u201d, \netc. \n 5\n \nAlthough to talk in this way may be fun we have to use our words with the meanings \nthat they have historically acquired.  So it might be better to rephrase the point and \nsay that what has been referred to above as the transcendental social and phenomena \nthat we have ethnocentrically called religion are part and parcel of a single unity. This \nimplies that the English word \u201creligion\u201d, inevitably carrying with it the history of \nChristianity, is misleading for understanding such phenomena as ancestor worship \nsince, in such cases, there is not the same boundary between the \u201csupernatural\u201d and \nthe \u201cnatural\u201d as that perceived to occur in societies caught in the history of the \nAbrahamic religions.  The boundary exists also in these cases, however, and it occurs \nbetween one type of social (the transcendental social including the phenomena that \nhave been called religion) and the transactional social. This boundary is clear in the \nkind of society I am referring to and explains the two different ways of acting towards \nthe Malagasy elder noted above. \n   \nThe inseparability of the transcendental social and the religious is not only manifest in \ncases of so-called \u201cancestor worship\u201d.   Hinduism is a phenomenon that is often \nassumed to be comparable with the Abrahamic religions but such an equation is \nmisleading for the same reasons as apply to the African examples discussed above.  \nFor example, Fuller begins his study of popular Hinduism by pointing out that a wife \nshould, and indeed does, at some moments, treat her husband in the same way as she \ntreats the gods.  The same gestures and bodily positions are used in both cases in \nperforming puja and the husband can thus be said to be a \u201cgod\u201d to his wife in the \nHindu sense of god. The point is that here also the transcendental social husband and \nwife role is part of one single overarching transcendental hierarchical social system \nthat includes the gods (Fuller 1992).  \n \n \nThe societies I have discussed above clearly present a challenge for the kind of \ntheories referred to at the beginning of this article, that is the theories advocated by, \namong others, Boyer.  This is because they explain a phenomenon that can only be \ndistinguished from a greater whole: the transcendental social, by using a contrast \nbetween the religious and the secular that is borrowed from a relatively modern \nsystem of representations that simply does not apply in their cases.  Consequently I \nshall argue that it is the greater whole in its totality, i.e. the transcendental, that needs \nto be explained.  However, such a redefinition of the project presents an obvious \ndifficulty.  If Boyer is wrong to take a specific type of society, those with \u201creligion\u201d, \nto represent the human condition in general, is it not equally wrong to take specific \nother societies, those discussed in this paper so far, as representing human nature?   \n \nHistorical excursions. \n \nIn what follows I argue that this is not so because societies with \u201creligion\u201d are the \nsubsequent product of an inessential and superficial modification of the societies \ndiscussed above. A full demonstration of this point would require much more space \nthan is available in this short paper.  What follows is therefore nothing more than a \ntentative sketch of what such a proposal would look like.   So, in order to explain how \na certain state of affairs occurred for some, and only some, human groups I move to a \nhistorical argument to argue that it is in certain specific historical circumstances \n(admittedly of great importance for the majority of mankind though not for all) that \n 6\nthe kind of phenomena we call \u201creligious\u201d take on a separate appearance that seems to \ndistinguish it from the more inclusive transcendental social.   \n \nThe creation of an apparently separate \u201creligion\u201d is closely tied to the history of the \nstate. It has long been noted that in early states such a Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, \nthe early Andean states and many other places that the  \u201creligious\u201d and the \u201cpolitical\u201d \nwere inseparable.  Frankfort long ago argued that in ancient Egypt pharaoh was a \nvisible god interacting on a compatible footing with the invisible gods. The \norganisation of the state was part of the divine order (Frankfort: 1948).  The ancient \nEgyptian kingdom was part of an explicit cosmic ordering of space and time.  The \nrecurrence of the flooding of the Nile was represented as the consequence of the \nrepetitive cyclic action of the gods, including the pharaoh. The world was centred on \nthe capital with distant uncivilised, barely human, peripheral peoples far from its \ncentre.  Egypt was, to borrow the Chinese phrase, the empire of the centre.  All this is \nthe familiar attribute of what has been called divine kingship, whether it is that of the \nSwazi, Indic states or the Mesopotamian city-states.  \n \nThe transcendental representation of such states was not all there was to political \norganisation. There were also other available transactional representations of the state, \npharaoh, time and space. In much the same way as the Malagasy elder is dual it was \nalso possible to see the pharaoh in more straightforward terms, and that was in spite of \nthe prodigious efforts that were made to transform him through his palace and his \ntomb into an empirical manifestation of his transcendental side.  \n \nThe transcendental construction of such states is also accompanied by another \ncorollary process.   The development of the Merina state in Madagascar in the \neighteenth and nineteenth century shows how the construction of the symbolic state is \naccompanied by a partial destruction and reformulation of the symbolism of the \nsubjects.   Thus, certain key attributes of elders\/ancestors were forcibly transferred \nfrom local descent groups to the king and his palace (Bloch 1986).  Interestingly, a \nsimilar process involving the diminution of the transcendental social of subjects for \nthe benefit and construction of the royal transcendental has been examined for early \nEgypt by David Wengrow (2006). \n \nThus the royal centralised transcendental construction depends on the partial \ndestruction or at least transformation of the symbolical system of subjects. In \nMadagascar the focus of the symbolism of the subjects migrated, thanks to violent \nencouragement, from the house to the tomb, as the palace became the symbolical \nhouse of the kingdom with the ruler as its central \u201cpost\u201d (in Malagasy Andry the root \nof the word for ruler Andriana: lord)  (Bloch 1995).  Similarly, and in more detail, I \ndescribed how the descent group ritual of circumcision subsequently became \norchestrated by the state and how certain aspects were taken away from the elders to \nbecome constitutive elements of grand state occasions.  The descent groups lost key \nelements to the representative of the state and were punished if they attempted to \nperform the full ritual independently (Bloch 1986).    \n \nSince in such systems the transcendental social and the religious are identical it is not \njust the religious that is being reorganised in a centralised state and sucked up to a \npoint into a centralised, organised, organic-seeming system, it is the whole \ntranscendental social.  The creation of this transcendental holistic image of the \n 7\ncomplete kingdom, including gods and men, thus requires the creation of the \nincompleteness and disorganisation of the subjects\u2019 transcendental social which can \nonly be made complete in the kingdom. \n \nAfter such a process, a change that is different to the symbolic centralisation of the \nstate, happens.  States are unstable and political systems continually collapse.  That \ncauses a new problem. When the royal state collapses at the hand of its enemies the \nsubjects find themselves bereft because the construction of the state had previously \nmade them transcendentally incomplete and the state, after its collapse, is not there \nanymore to complete them. \n \nThe same Malagasy example can again illustrate this point.  The growth of the Merina \nkingdom in the nineteenth century had led to the circumcision ritual being partly \ntaken out of the transcendental construction of descent groups and being placed in the \nrealm of the symbolical construction of the kingdom.  However in 1868, when the \nMerina kingdom became disorganised, in part because of the influence of \nChristianity, the ruler failed to perform the royal circumcision ritual.  At that point a \npopular movement arose which sought to force him to perform it. \n \nWhy did the subjects feel bereft by the royal non-performance when originally the \nritual had been their privilege?  Why should they seek the state that in many ways \nexploited them?  Because, given the previous process, when the state collapsed, they \nwere left with nothing but their incomplete transcendental social and, for reasons that \nI cannot explain, it seems as if the deprivation process is irreversible.  Thus, when the \nstate, having confiscated a large part of the transcendental social so as to create its \nown ordered pseudo totality of cosmic order, then collapsed, a totalising \ntranscendental representation without its political foundation remained, floating in \nmid air, so to speak. This begins to look like what we call \u201creligion\u201d. For example, the \ncollapse of the political base of the transcendental social may lead to the occurrence \nof these ritual, sacred, pseudo-royal systems of Africa that so fascinated Frazer, where \nas Evans-Pritchard said, the king \u201creigns but does not rule\u201d (Evans-Pritchard: 1948).  \nIt is what leads to shadow \u201cstates\u201d which only exist in mystical form as spirits that \npossess mediums. Examples of these are found among the Shona or in Western \nMadagascar where they were caused, Feeley-Harnik argues, by the collapse of the \npolitical as a consequence of colonial rule (Feeley-Harnik: 1991).  This is also what \nexplains the bizarre institutions of contemporary European monarchies.  These post-\nstate \u201cstates\u201d are  \u201creligions\u201d, that is phenomena apparently distinct from the rest of \nthe transcendental social. \n \nThe Abrahamic religions offer another example of the process. The historian of \nJudaism and of early Christianity J.Z. Smith argues that Jewish monotheism must be \nunderstood as the product of a longing for the unified, centralised, holistic \ntranscendental Mesopotamian city-states with Ziggurats at their centre.  These were a \nkind of state that the Jews, as minor peripherals to that system, hardly ever managed \nto achieve for themselves, or, when they did, did so on a tiny fragile scale. Early \nJudaism is therefore also a transcendental incomplete residue: religion.  This residue \nwas modelled on the Mesopotamian prototype with at its centre the Ziggurat in a \npurely \u201creligious\u201d form, that is the temple in Jerusalem (Smith: 1982).  \n \n 8\nWith this sort of situation we therefore get religions, which are only apparently \nseparate from the transcendental social state, but this separation is always \nuncomfortable and unfinished and it leads to the kind of flirting processes between \nstate and religion that has characterised history in much of the Abrahamic world. At \nleast in Europe and those great sways of Asia and Africa that are still under the \nghostly spell of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt.  This flirting takes various forms.  \nOne form of the process involves new states taking on, ready made, one of these \npolitically detached religions issued from clearly different political entities.  Rome \nwas an example of the process.  Imperial Rome became one of these centralised \nsystems where political conquest led to the creation of a transcendental social \nrepresentation of the state through making incomplete the transcendental social of \nsubjects.  Yet the transcendental construction never worked very well and when Rome \ngot into even more trouble than usual the system broke down.  This led to the \nadoption of foreign and abandoned centre-religions, therefore \u201chungry\u201d for the \nrecovery of their lost politico\/transcendental social element, for example: Judaism, \nother Eastern \u201creligions\u201d, and, ultimately, one of the many forms of Christianity.  \nRome was therefore taking on the religious side of a centralised system from a \ncollapsed tiny city-state as a late attempt at reorganisation of a unified transcendental \n(Beard et al: 1998). \n \nThe process repeated itself.  When, in the seventh century, the Franks began to \ndevelop centralised entities in Western Europe they picked up Christianity and, so to \nspeak, \u201cput it on\u201d with modifications to make it fit.   One of the most spectacular \nmoments was when Charlemagne in 800 invented a ritual which made him the Holy \nRoman Emperor with bits borrowed from the old testament, from Frankish rituals and \nof course, above all, from Roman rituals (Nelson 1987) . \n \nThe other form of the relation between religion and the state, made necessary by their \nprevious separation as a result of the collapse of a centralised unit, is for the religious \nbit to try to grow back its lost political undercarriage. Again and again, the popes \ntried. The Ayatollah Khomeini was more successful. Most of the movements that \nhave been called millenarians try this sort of thing. Mormon history furnishes a \nparticularly interesting example.  Joseph Smith started the Mormon religion in the \neastern United States for people who were heirs to a Christian religion that at many \nremoves was heir to a long history of trouble between the religious like pretensions of \nthe state and the state like pretensions of religion.  However, the Mormons were, in a \nplace where the state was weak, and, unusually, where the totalising cosmological \npretensions of post state religion were strikingly incoherent, largely because they were \nmeant to apply to a country not included in the cosmology of the Bible. So the \nMormons put that to right by finding a Gospel that did mention the new world and its \ninhabitants and, in their creative enthusiasm, began to rebuild the political part of the \ndestroyed transcendental entity.  Not surprisingly this annoyed the other state in \nWashington and they had to try to build it up in the desert, which, amazingly, they \njust about succeeded in doing.  At the centre of this renewed unitary entity, where the \ntranscendental social and religious were again to be an inseparable totality as in \nancient Egypt or Mesopotamia, they built their temple; a temple that looks strikingly \nlike a Ziggurat. \n \nConclusion. \n \n 9\nThe point of these historical excursions is to suggest that the separation of religion \nfrom the transcendental social in general is, even in the places where it appears at first \nto exist, superficial and transient. In any case, this superficial phenomenon has \noccurred in human history only relatively recently.   \n \nIt is this transcendental social in its totality that should be our focus.  It is what \ndistinguishes the human social from that of other closely related animals, such as \nChimpanzees. It is an essential characteristic and a unique part of that special human \nsociality, which many have suggested, is the fundamental difference between humans \nand other anthropoids. An explanation of its occurrence cannot thus be in terms of a \nminor evolutionary adaptation, or miss-adaptation, as is suggested by Boyer type \ntheories. \n \nSuch a conclusion is negative, but it is possible to propose a more positive and fruitful \none.   \n \nWhat the transcendental social requires is the ability to live very largely in \nimagination. We often act towards elders, kings, mothers, etc. not in terms of how \nthey appear to the senses at any particular moment but as if they were something else: \nessential transcendental beings. Once we realise this omnipresence of the imaginary in \nthe everyday nothing special is left to explain concerning \u201creligion\u201d. What needs to be \nexplained is the much more general question how it is that we can act so much of the \ntime towards visible people in terms of their invisible halo. The tool for this \nfundamental operation is the capacity for imagination.  It is while searching for \nneurological evidence for the development of this capacity and of its social \nimplications that we, in passing, will account for religious-like phenomena.  Trying to \nunderstand how imagination can account for the transcendental social, and \nincidentally \u201creligion\u201d is a quite different enterprise to accounting for the religious for \nitself in terms of modules, or core knowledge, which, in any case, we share with other \nprimates. Unlike these imagination does seem to distinguish us from Chimpanzees \nand perhaps also distinguishes post upper palaeolithic humans from their forebears.   \n \nA number of recent writers have suggested something along the same lines. In a book \nby Paul Harris about imagination, the author shows how the ability to engage \nspontaneously in pretend play begins very young and develops in a multitude of ways \nsuch as creating \u201cimaginary friends\u201d and other forms of explicit make believe. Such \nimagination practice seems essential for normal human development.  Nothing like \nthat occurs in other species.  Clearly this capacity is necessary for engaging in the \ntranscendental social as defined above, inevitably including the religious-like. The \nselective advantage this form of sociality procures explains its evolutionary potential. \nIt is central to human life.  Harris suggests this centrality in an adventurous \nintroduction when he notes that the first evidence for such a capacity is the cave \npaintings of Europe dating back to around 40,000 years ago (Harris: 2000).  He might \nhave gone a bit further back, to what has been called the upper palaeolithic revolution; \none feature of which was the first suggestion of transcendental roles found in grand \nburial. \n \nAgain, in a parallel argument, also taking empirical data on ontological development \nas its starting point, Hannes Rakoczy connects imagination and the transcendental \nsocial even more explicitly (Rakoczy: 2007) In that work, and that of his co-workers, \n 10\nthis is referred to as \u201cstatus functions\u201d but it is as yet little developed.  However the \nargument is strikingly similar to that proposed above and totally congruent. It does not \nhowever, like Harris, touch on the topic of \u201creligion\u201d, but according to my argument, \nthis is inevitably subsumed under this type of discussion of the social.   \n \n \nTo explain religion is therefore a fundamentally misguided enterprise. It is rather like \ntrying to explain the function of headlights while ignoring what motorcars are like and \nfor. What needs to be explained is the nature of human sociability and then religion \nsimply appears as an aspect of this that cannot stand alone.  Unfortunately the recent \ngeneral discussion on social cognition does not succeed in doing the job that is needed \nto understand the transcendental social either.  This is because, for the most part, it \nhas considered the human social as an elaboration and an expansion of the type of \nsocial found in other animals, especially other primates (Dunbar: 2004). This is useful \nbut it obscures a fundamental difference between humans and others.  Such an \napproach only pays attention to the transactional, or the \u201cmachiavellian\u201d social, since \nthat is what is shared by, for example, baboons and humans.  It ignores the uniquely \nhuman transcendental social that represents a qualitative difference with other non-\nhuman socialities.  What is essential to understand is the evolution of this specificity.   \nConcentrating on that equally unique human capacity imagination seems the most \nfruitful approach in hat enterprise and, in passing, we will also account for religion \nsince it is nothing special.  \n \n \n \n \nReferences. \n \n \nAndersen, B. 1983   Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and the \nSpread of Nationalism.
