INTRODUCTION\nONE of the important applications envisioned in thenext generation mobile systems is to provide efficient\nmultimedia streaming services (unicast or multicast-based)\nover heterogeneous wireless networks. One principle research\nchallenge foreseen in this context is to assign a user to the\nbest access network when he\/she is reachable throughout a\nwide variety of networks [1], [2], [3], [4]. The widely used\nsolution in recent literature is the user-centric (UC) approach\nin which every mobile user chooses the access network based\non the knowledge obtainable at user side such as, the perceived\nquality of received services etc [1], [2], [3]. In [4], a user\nassignment algorithm with network assistance was proposed.\nHowever, the existing mechanisms may lead to inefficient\nresource utilization due to the limited inputs used in the\nuser assignment process. In particular for multicast-based\nservices, the one-to-many transmission characteristic makes\nthis situation worse due to the increased heterogeneity of users\ninterested in the same content. This letter addresses the User\nAssignment (UA) problem using a network-centric approach\nin which total resources are coordinated among all users by\nthe network operator so as to optimize the usage of overall\nresources. Moreover, we exploit the rate-adaptive feature of\nmultimedia applications [5]to further improve the efficiency\nof wireless resource utilization. We present a formal definition\nand formulation of the UA problem, using a mathematical\noptimization technique, which we have not yet found in\nliterature.\nII.

We\nadopt the concept of utility, which is widely used for the radio\nresource optimization [6]. Each user has a utility function\nthat quantifies the benefit of usage of certain resources. As\nin [6], the utility function \u00b5(r) is a non decreasing function\nof the data transmission rate r. In particular, when \u00b5(r)= r,\nthe utility is the throughput, which is the objective of most\ntraditional mobile network optimizations. The objective of the\nUA problem is to maximize the aggregated utilities among all\nthe users in the system. This objective is achieved by selecting\nthe best combination of cells and the transmission rates to\ndeliver required contents to interested users simultaneously.\nLet C be the set of multimedia contents to be delivered in\nthe system. Each c\u2208C has a set of supportable rates Sc. Let H\nthe set of multicast-enabled cells in the system. Each cell h\u2208H\ncan be characterized by a two-dimensional vector (mh, nh),\nwhere mhdenotes the maximum available bandwidth in the\ncell (in, e.g. kbps), and nhrepresents the type of the network\nto which the cell belongs (e.g., 3G or broadcasting network).\nLet U be the set of users in the system. Each user u\u2208U can\nbe specified by a four-dimensional vector (Ou,gu,ku,\u00b5u(du)),\nwhere Ou \u2286 H is the candidate cell set of the user based on\nhis\/her geographic location and the terminal\u2019s supportable air\ninterfaces; gudenotes the ID of the content requested by the\nuser; kurepresents the capacity of the user\u2019s terminal, in terms\nof the maximum supportable transmission rate and \u00b5u(du)is\nthe utility of the user with the actual received rate du. If\nduis not available, \u00b5u(du) = 0. dushould be chosen from\nthe supportable data rates of the user\u2019s desired content gu,\nsubject to the user\u2019s terminal capacity limit ku. Therefore,\nfor each user u, there is a particular set of transmission rates\nRufeasible to choose. Rucontains all the rates not greater than\nku in set Sgu. Hence, the user\u2019s utility can be interpreted\nas \u00b5u(r), r \u2208 Ru. In addition, the serving cell\u2019s capacity\nlimit is another factor that determines r. We let wu,h,rthe\nconsumed radio resources of user u given the serving cell h\nand transmission rate r. wu,h,ris interpreted as the consumed\nbandwidth (in kbps) in our work. For unicast, wu,h,rcan be\ncalculated straight forward from his\/her allocated rate r once\nthe assignment for this user is completed, i.e., wu,h,r = r.\nIn contrast, radio resources can be used more efficiently\nin multicast by delivering only one copy of content (via\na multicast radio channel) to a group of users in a cell.\nHence, the average consumed resource of an individual user\nis negative proportional to the number of users assigned in the\nsame radio transmission in cell h (we denote this number as\nMh), and thus, the consumed resource is unknown until all\nthe users have been assigned. Mathematically, wu,h,r = rMh ,\n1089-7798\/06$20.00 c\u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 04,2010 at 13:26:16 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

An example of UA problem.\nif Mh > 0.\nThe UA optimization is to assign each user from U to\nexactly one cell from Ou, and serve this user with exactly\none transmission rate from Ru, so as to maximize the total\nuser utilities. Furthermore, each user interested in the same\ncontent can be assigned to a different cell and served with\ndifferent data rate, as long as the capacity m of that particular\ncell is not violated. In a cell, these users are served with\none multicast transmission. For instance, in Fig. 1, u1and\nu2are interested in content c1. Ou1 = {h3}due to the limits\nof the 3G cell coverage, and Ru1 = {128, 256}due to the\nlimits of the terminal capacity. As a result, u1can be assigned\nto h3with the rate of 128 kbps due to the cell capacity\nlimits. For u2, Ou2 = {h1, h3}, Ru2 = {128, 256, 384}.\nFor more efficient resource utilization, u2can be given the\nsame assignment as u1, thus both of them sharing a common\nmulticast transmission. This assignment can be fulfilled by\napplying the criterion that assign the user to the cell that\nconsumes the least radio resources, i.e., wu2,h1,128 = 128kbps\nwhile wu2,h3,128 = 64kbps.\nThe inputs to the optimization are C, H and U. The output\nis a binary optimal allocation vector, xu,h,r, u \u2208 U , h \u2208 Ou,\nr \u2208 Ru. Ifxu,h,r = 1, user u is assigned to cell h with rate r.\nThe UA problem can be formally stated as follows:\nMaximize:\nSystemUtility =\n\u2211\nu\u2208U\n\u2211\nh\u2208Ou\n\u2211\nr\u2208Ru\n\u00b5(r)xu,h,r (1)\nSubject to: Constraint (a) the limits of cell capacity are\nsatisfied, i.e.,\n\u2211\nu\u2208U\n\u2211\nr\u2208Ru wu,h,rxu,h,r \u2264 mh,\u2200h \u2208 Ou;\nConstraint (b) each user can be assigned to at most one cell,\ni.e.,\n\u2211\nh\u2208Ou xu,h,r \u2264 1, \u2200u \u2208 U , r \u2208 Ru; Constraint (c) a\nuser can only be given at most one rate from Ruat a time, i.e.,\u2211\nr\u2208Ru xu,h,r \u2264 1,\u2200u \u2208 U , h \u2208 Ou. Constraint (d) the output\nis a binary integer, i.e., xu,h,r \u2208 {0, 1},\u2200u \u2208 U , h \u2208 Ou,\nr \u2208 Ru.\nWe prove the UA problem to be NP-hard by reducing it\nto a standard NP-hard problem i.e. Generalized Assignment\nProblem (GAP) [8]. The GAP is stated: given I knapsacks,\nJ items, with pijand aij the profit and weight of item j\nrespectively, if assigned to knapsack i, and bithe capacity of\nknapsack i, the problem is to assign each item to exactly one\nknapsack so as to maximize the total profit assigned without\nassigning to any knapsack where a total weight greater than\nits capacity. Any instance of GAP is equivalent to the instance\nof UA obtained by mapping the user and cell to be the item\nand knapsack in the GAP respectively; assuming only one rate\nincluded in Ru; setting user utility \u00b5u(r) = pij; user resource\nwu,h,r = aijand the cell capacity mh = bi, for u \u2208 U , h \u2208 H ,\nc \u2208 C.\nIII. ALGORITHM\nDue to the NP-hardness of the UA problem, the time\nrequired to find its optimal solution increases exponentially\nwith the size of the problem. This prohibitive processing\ncomplexity is intolerable in practical systems. In this paper,\na computationally efficient heuristic algorithm is instead pro-\nposed to find the sub-optimal solutions in practical systems.\nThis algorithm is named Maximize-Utility (MU) heuristic\nalgorithm and takes the following steps.\nStep 1: For each unassigned content c, calculate its maxi-\nmum utility u maxc. It is defined as the aggregate user utilities\nassuming these users are given the best assignment. u maxc\nis calculated as follows;\na) For each unassigned user for content c, find particular\ncell(s) from set Ouand the respective transmission rate(s) from\nset Ruso as to maximize the user\u2019s utility while subject to the\ncell capacity constraint. If there is no feasible cell available,\nthis user is marked as a Blocked-User (BU). If only one\ncell is feasible, this cell is chosen as the serving cell with\nthe respective transmission rate. The user is marked as an\nAdmitted-User (AU). If there are multiple feasible cells giving\nthe same utility, the user is marked as a Undetermined-User\n(UU) and is left for future processing along with other UU\nusers. Note that AU users need to be processed prior to UU\nusers, as UU users have more access cells to select;\nb) After all users are considered, we determine the serving\ncell for UU users. The idea is to assign a user to the cell\nthat consumes the least ratio resources [4]. We extend [4]by\nconsidering multicast applications. As explained in section II,\nin multicast, the user resource consumption is unknown until\nall users are assigned to appropriate cells. We devise (2) to\npredict the multicast resource consumption RC of a user:\nRC(u, h, r, c) =\n{\n0 if a user has been assigned\nr\/M otherwise\n(2)\nWhere, M is the number of unassigned UU users who can be\nserviced by the content c in cell h with rate r. This equation\nindicates that due to the resource sharing among users in a\nmulticast channel in a cell, more users are in this cell, fewer\nresources are consumed by individual users. Moreover, no\nextra resource is required for a new user if a user has been\nassigned to this cell during previous steps. The UU user is\nthen marked as AU.\nc) After all users are processed, we calculate the content\nutility u maxc based on the assignment calculated during\nprevious steps;\nStep 2: Among all the unassigned contents, the one that\ngenerates the largest nonzero u maxcwill be distributed to\nsubscribed users throughout cells with rates chosen in step 1;\nStep 3: Once the content is assigned, the remaining resource\nof each chosen cell is updated. Repeat step 1 to step 3 until\nall the contents have been processed.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 04,2010 at 13:26:16 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Overall user utility and user loss probability vs. number of contents\nunder two ND cases (\u00b5(r) = r).\nIV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nWe evaluated our algorithm using OPNET. Two types of\nkey-multicast-enabled networks are considered, i.e., MBMS\n3G network n1and DVB network n2. These networks are\noverlapping in a common service area A. We study two\nNetwork Deployment (ND) cases as presented in Table 1.\nThe capacity limits of each cell are randomly generated. The\nrate of the content is randomly generated from the vector\n{32, 64, 128, 256, 384} kbps. Users are uniformly distributed\nover the area A with terminal capacity limits up to 384 kbps.\nThe probability of a user\u2019s request for a content follows Zipf\ndistribution [7]. The average number of users for a content\nis 10 in a cell of type n1. We evaluate the MU heuristic\nalgorithm by comparing it to a conventional UC algorithm\nin which each user chooses a combination of the network and\ndata rate, which gives the highest utility or marginal utility\n(the difference between the user utility and the monetary\ncost) [1], [2], [3]. The monetary cost is not considered in\nour study. In case of the same utility, selection is performed\nrandomly. Simulation results in Fig. 2 show the MU algorithm\nachieves significant gain over the UC algorithm in both user\nutility and loss probability. Furthermore, when the number of\ncontents increases from 10 to 50, or the number of constituent\naccess networks increases from ND Case 1 to ND Case 2,\nmore improvement is achieved by the MU algorithm. These\nresults demonstrate the significance and value of using the\nMU heuristic algorithm for operators to optimize the multicast\ncontent delivering in heterogeneous wireless networks.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe presented a network-centric solution to the user as-\nsignment problem in multicast-enabled heterogeneous wire-\nless networks. This problem was mathematically formulated\nand proven to be NP-hard. Moreover, an efficient heuristic\nalgorithm was derived to find the sub-optimal solutions of the\nproblem in practical systems. Simulation results demonstrated\nthe improved performance of this algorithm. Additionally,\nthe proposed algorithm performed consistently well under\na wide variety of traffic loads and number of networks.\nThe implementation issues of the proposed algorithm are\naddressed in [9]in terms of architecture, functional entities,\nnetwork interfaces, signaling and exchanged parameters. The\nproposed algorithm is applicable to both off-line and on-line\nUA problem. For an on-line operation, \u201cbatching\u201d of user\nrequests should be performed for individual contents prior to\nthe user assignment in order to aggregate enough users for\nmulticast transmission. The combination of batching and user\nassignment algorithms can be found in our previous work [10].\nREFERENCES\n[1] V. Gazis, N. Houssos, N. Alonistioti, and L.
