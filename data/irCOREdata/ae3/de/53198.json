Although recent decades have seen much development of statistical methods to estimate 16 \ndemographic parameters such as reproduction, and survival and migration probabilities, the 17 \nfocus is usually the estimation of parameters for individual species. This is despite the fact that 18 \nseveral species may live in close proximity, sometimes competing for the same resources. 19 \nThere is therefore a great need for new methods that enable a better integration of 20 \ndemographic data, e.g. the study of synchrony between sympatric species, which are subject 21 \nto common environmental stochasticity and potentially similar biotic interactions. 22 \n2. We propose a mark-recapture statistical model that uses random effect terms for studying 23 \nsynchrony in a demographic parameter at a multi-species level, adapting a framework initially 24 \ndeveloped to study multi-site synchrony to this novel situation. The model allows us to divide 25 \nbetween-year variance in a demographic parameter into a \u2018synchronous\u2019 component, common 26 \n2 \n \nto all species considered, and species-specific \u2018asynchronous\u2019 components, as well as to 27 \nestimate the proportion of each component accounted for by environmental covariates. 28 \n3. We demonstrate the method with data from three colonially-breeding auk species that share 29 \nresources during the breeding season at the Isle of May, Scotland. Mark-resight information 30 \nhas been collected since 1984 for Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica, common guillemots Uria 31 \naalge and razorbills Alca torda marked as breeding adults. We explore the relationship 32 \nbetween synchrony in the species' survival and two environmental covariates.       33 \n4. Most of the between-year variation was synchronous to the three species, and the same 34 \nenvironmental covariates acted simultaneously as synchronising and desynchronising agents 35 \nof adult survival, possibly through different indirect causation paths. 36 \n5. Synthesis and applications. The model proposed allows the investigation of multi-species 37 \nsynchrony and asynchrony in adult survival, as well as the role of environmental covariates in 38 \ngenerating them. It provides insight into whether sympatric species respond similarly or 39 \ndifferently to changes in their environment, and helps to disentangle the sources of these 40 \ndifferences. The estimated indices of synchrony\/asynchrony can facilitate the generation of 41 \nfurther hypotheses about similarities\/differences in these species\u2019 ecology, such as the 42 \npotential overlap of wintering areas. The method is readily applicable to other species, 43 \necosystems and demographic parameters. 44 \nKeywords: adult survival, Atlantic puffin, Bayesian models, common guillemot, 45 \nenvironmental covariates, interspecific synchronisation, partition of variance, random effects, 46 \nrazorbill, WinBUGS. 47 \n 48 \n49 \n3 \n \nIntroduction 50 \nThe monitoring of demographic parameters is generating a wealth of valuable information for 51 \necology and conservation and recent decades have seen a corresponding proliferation of 52 \nstatistical models for analysing these types of data. However the potential to integrate different 53 \ntypes of data has not been fully exploited, with the majority of these models targeted at 54 \nanalysing single demographic parameters for individual species (Lebreton et al. 1992; Williams 55 \net al. 2002), although some approaches such as integrated population modelling (Besbeas et 56 \nal. 2005) jointly estimate several parameters in a single species analysis. Data from several 57 \nspecies have recently been combined in models to study population trends (Sauer & Link 58 \n(2002)) or species richness (multispecies occupancy models, Dorazio & Royle (2005), Russell 59 \net al. (2009)) but a move away from single-species single-location to more encompassing 60 \napproaches is still largely overdue. 61 \nSpecies exist within the context of communities and ecosystems, and when 62 \npopulations of different species are sympatric they are exposed to biotic interactions  and the 63 \nsame abiotic environment (Begon et al. 2006). Some species may react in a similar way to 64 \ntheir common environment, showing synchrony in population trends or in the temporal 65 \nvariation of some demographic parameters such as survival. The underlying cause of 66 \nsynchrony between species is usually not clear, with hypotheses suggesting shared stochastic 67 \neffects, such as weather (Hawkins & Holyoak 1998) and the response to common predators 68 \n(Raimondo et al. 2004). The study of the species in a community in isolation may lead to only 69 \na partial understanding of their ecology or even to incorrect conclusions.  70 \nSynchrony between sympatric populations of different species has received less 71 \nattention compared to synchrony between allopatric populations of a single species 72 \n(Raimondo et al. 2004). The relatively few multi-species examples to date typically address 73 \nsynchrony in abundance through the study of time-series of population size (Swanson & 74 \nJohnson 1999; Raimondo et al. 2004) and are often dedicated to understanding mechanistic 75 \npredator-prey interactions (New 2009). In general, investigating the mechanisms underlying 76 \npopulation change is a difficult task when studying time series of abundance alone, and the 77 \n4 \n \nincorporation of demographic parameters such as survival, reproductive success and dispersal 78 \nprobabilities is often key in understanding such mechanisms (Loison et al. 2002). 79 \nWe propose a statistical model for studying the variation of a demographic parameter 80 \nat a multi-species level, through the use of random effects. Between-year variance in the 81 \ndemographic parameter is divided into a \u2018synchronous\u2019 component, that represents the 82 \ncommon response of all species considered, and \u2018asynchronous\u2019 components, specific to each 83 \nspecies, and we estimate the contribution of environmental covariates to each of these 84 \ncomponents. The model is based on that presented by Grosbois et al. (2009) for studying the 85 \nvariation of adult survival for a single species at a multi-population scale, although it is 86 \nconceptually different in its interpretation, and further we relax the variance structure in the 87 \nmodel to accommodate differences among species. In this paper, we demonstrate an 88 \napplication of the method to explore synchrony in adult survival using 25 years of individual 89 \nmark-resight data for three seabird species, the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica (L.), the 90 \ncommon guillemot Uria aalge (Pontoppidan) and the razorbill Alca torda L., collected at the 91 \nbreeding colony on the Isle of May, southeast Scotland. These three auks (Alcidae) have 92 \nbroadly similar life histories and ecology (Gaston & Jones 1998). Birds from breeding 93 \npopulations on the Isle of May show largely overlapping distributions throughout the year 94 \n(Wernham et al. 2002) and are thus likely to be exposed to similar environmental stochasticity. 95 \nConsequently we would expect some degree of synchrony in their response in terms of the 96 \ntemporal variation of demographic parameters. Adult survival probabilities for Isle of May 97 \npuffins, guillemots and razorbills have previously been analysed separately (Harris et al. 1997; 98 \nHarris et al. 2000; Crespin et al. 2006),  but to date no attempt has been made to integrate 99 \nsurvival data for these species, and in particular, to look for synchronising and 100 \ndesynchronising agents. 101 \n102 \n5 \n \nMaterials and Methods 103 \nMark-resight data 104 \nMark-resight information was collected for 543 Atlantic puffins (hereafter puffin), 831 common 105 \nguillemots (hereafter guillemot) and 153 razorbills at the Isle of May (56\u00b011\u2019N, 2\u00b034\u2019W), 106 \nsoutheast Scotland. As with many seabirds, annual adult survival probabilities of puffins, 107 \nguillemots and razorbills are normally high (Harris et al. 1997; Sandvik et al. 2005). Birds visit 108 \nland only for breeding and while puffins nest in burrows, guillemots and razorbills lay eggs 109 \ndirectly on narrow cliff ledges. Outside the breeding season, auks from the Isle of May 110 \ndisperse over broad areas of the North Sea (Wernham et al. 2002), and during the breeding 111 \nseason they eat similar prey, mainly small, lipid-rich, shoaling fish such as the lesser sandeel 112 \nAmmodytes marinus and sprat Sprattus sprattus (Daunt et al. 2008). Between 1984 and 2007, 113 \nbreeding birds in front of permanent hides were marked with unique colour-rings and 114 \nresightings of these birds took place each year up to 2008. Once they have bred, individuals of 115 \nall species rarely breed more than a few metres from where they were marked (MPH, pers. 116 \nobs.), so resighting effort was mainly focussed on these areas although regular searches were 117 \nalso made in all nearby areas to locate individuals of the three species that had moved. 118 \nMulti-species synchrony model 119 \nUsing the standard open population capture-mark-recapture\/resight models for estimating 120 \napparent survival and recapture\/resight probabilities (reviewed in Lebreton et al. (1992)), 121 \nlikelihood functions can be constructed individually for each of the species involved in the 122 \nmodel. Following standard notation, we denote resight probability in year Y as p(Y) and annual 123 \napparent adult survival probability from year Y to Y+1 as \u03a6(Y). Both resight and survival 124 \nprobabilities can then be modelled to depend on explanatory variables. In order to allow the 125 \nstudy of synchrony in survival probabilities, we followed the framework presented by Grosbois 126 \net al. (2009) and introduced random year effects in the relationship of survival with covariates 127 \nas follows: 128 \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029 )(\u03b5\u03b4(Y)(Y)c , ... (Y),cfYlogit SnS1SS s YS \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\uf066 .         (eqn 1) 129 \n6 \n \n\u03a6S(Y) is the apparent adult survival from year Y to Y+1 for species S. Survival is related to 130 \ncovariates and random effects through the logit link function, although alternative link functions 131 \nare possible. The relationship with covariates is handled through fS(.), a species-specific 132 \nfunction of ns covariates cSi. The function could be for example a linear regression or a 133 \nnonparametric relationship. For the year random effects, \u03b4(Y) is a random term which is 134 \ncommon to all species considered and only depends on the year, and \u03b5S(Y) is a random term 135 \nthat depends on the year and species. The \u03b4 and \u03b5S terms are assumed to be independent 136 \nand have distributions \uf028 \uf0292\u03b4\u03b60,N ~\u03b4(Y)  and \uf028 \uf0292sS \u03b60,N ~(Y)\u03b5  respectively, with no correlation 137 \nbetween terms. We extend the approach of Grosbois et al. (2009) so that the \u2018year x species\u2019 138 \nrandom terms can have different variances for the different species (i.e. \n2\ns\u03b6 are species-139 \nspecific) and so the between-year variance in survival unexplained by the covariates can be 140 \ndifferently partitioned for different species. The \u03b4 term corresponds to the amount of between-141 \nyear variation (unexplained by the covariates, if present) that is synchronous to all species 142 \nconsidered, while the \u03b5S terms characterise the species-specific (\u2018asynchronous\u2019) components. 143 \nNote also that Grosbois et al. (2009) use a single common covariate that takes different values 144 \nfor each colony, while in this study each common covariate has the same value for all the 145 \nspecies considered (as the geographical area is the same), but each species might have a 146 \ndifferent combination of covariates.  147 \nAssuming independence between the data for the different species, the overall 148 \nlikelihood function for all species together can be written as the product of the individual 149 \nlikelihoods. This is similar to the way in which likelihood components corresponding to different 150 \ndemographic parameters are combined for a single species in an integrated population 151 \nmodelling framework (Besbeas et al. 2005). In the proposed model, the species-specific 152 \nlikelihood components share at least one parameter, the variance of the common random term 153 \n\u03b4. 154 \nOnce the model parameters have been estimated, a species-specific intra-class 155 \ncorrelation coefficient can be calculated based on the variances of the random terms as an 156 \nindex of synchrony in adult survival:    157 \n7 \n \n2\ns\n2\n\u03b4\n2\n\u03b4\ns\n\u03b6\u02c6\u03b6\u02c6\n\u03b6\u02c6\nICC\n\uf02b\n\uf03d .     (eqn 2) 158 \nThis quantity represents the synchrony of species S with the rest of the species: the amount of 159 \nbetween-year variance for species S (either total or unexplained by the covariates, if present in 160 \nthe model) that is accounted for by the common random term \u03b4(Y). When 2\u03b4\u03b6\u02c6  is large 161 \ncompared to\n2\ns\u03b6\u02c6 , then ICCS is large and the between-year variation for that species is then 162 \nmostly synchronous with the other species. 163 \nIn order to evaluate the effect of the environmental covariates in generating synchrony 164 \nand asynchrony between species survival, two models are compared, following the method in 165 \nLoison et al. (2002) and Grosbois et al. (2009). Both models include random effects \u03b4(Y) and 166 \n\u03b5S(Y) but one of them does not have covariates (only a separate intercept for each species). 167 \nWe can define the residual variance of \u03b4, (res)\u03b6\u02c62\u03b4 , for the model with covariates, and the total 168 \nvariance, (total)\u03b6\u02c62\u03b4 when there are no covariates but only random effect terms. The same can 169 \nbe done for each species for the variance of the \u03b5S term: (res)\u03b6\u02c6\n2\ns , (total)\u03b6\u02c6\n2\ns . Based on these 170 \nvalues, a set of coefficients can be calculated: 171 \n(total)\u03b6\u02c6\n(res)\u03b6\u02c6\n1C\n2\n\u03b4\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4 \uf02d\uf03d . (eqn 3) 172 \n(total)\u03b6\u02c6\n(res)\u03b6\u02c6\n1C\n2\ns\n2\ns\ns \uf02d\uf03d , for each species S.   (eqn 4) 173 \nC\u03b4 and the Cs coefficients measure the contribution of the environmental covariates to the 174 \ninterspecific synchronous \u03b4 and asynchronous \u03b5s components of the between-year variances, 175 \nrespectively. 176 \n 177 \nEnvironmental covariates for survival  178 \nEnvironmental covariates are known to influence demographic parameters in many species 179 \n(Stenseth et al. 2003), and have been shown in some cases to be responsible for interspecific 180 \nsynchrony (Hawkins & Holyoak 1998). In the case of North Atlantic seabird survival 181 \n8 \n \nprobabilities, studies often include covariates related to two oceanographic factors, the North 182 \nAtlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the temperature at the sea surface (SST). 183 \nThe winter NAO index is a well-known indicator of climatic conditions over north-184 \nwestern Europe and has been shown to influence ecological processes (Stenseth et al. 2003). 185 \nWinter NAO with various time-lags have been related to survival of Atlantic puffins, common 186 \nguillemots and razorbills (Harris et al. 2005; Sandvik et al. 2005; Grosbois et al. 2009). For this 187 \nstudy, we used the station-based extended winter (December to March) North Atlantic 188 \nOscillation index (\u2018wNAO\u2019), obtained at 189 \nhttp:\/\/www.cgd.ucar.edu\/cas\/jhurrell\/indices.html. Following Sandvik et al. (2005) and Harris et 190 \nal. (2005), we used both wNAO without time lag (\u2018wNAO_0\u2019), that reflects the direct effect of 191 \nweather harshness on survival, and wNAO with a 1-year time lag (\u2018wNAO_1\u2019), that reflects the 192 \nindirect effect of climate, possibly through the food chain. 193 \nSeveral different indices based on SST averaged over different areas and seasons 194 \nhave been used in relation to the three species considered here (Harris et al. 1997; Harris et al. 195 \n2005; Sandvik et al. 2005; Grosbois et al. 2009). For this study, monthly values were obtained 196 \nfrom http:\/\/iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu\/SOURCES\/.IGOSS\/.nmc\/.Reyn_SmithOIv2\/.monthly\/.sst 197 \nand averaged for an area of 10 cells around the Isle of May, on a grid of 1\u00b0x1\u00b0. The first SST 198 \ncovariate considered was the average over January to May, following Harris et al. (2005). We 199 \ndenote this variable as \u2018SST_0\u2019 (no time lag). This period of the year coincides with the 200 \nspawning season and larval period of the sandeel, the auks\u2019 main prey species during the 201 \nbreeding season. We also included its 1-year time lag \u2018SST_1\u2019, that is, the average over 202 \nJanuary to May of the previous year (Harris et al. 2005).  203 \nHeterogeneity in resight probability 204 \nBefore fitting the data in combination, we assessed the goodness of fit (GOF) of the general 205 \nfully time-dependent Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model {\u03a6(t)p(t)} with program RELEASE 206 \n(Burnham et al. 1987), for each species individually. In this model, both survival and resight 207 \nprobabilities are allowed to vary from year to year. The GOF was very similar for all species 208 \nstudied. The general CJS model fits the data poorly, due mostly to the 2.C component 209 \n9 \n \n(guillemot: \u03c72=173.49, df=22; puffin: \u03c72=129,9, df=22; razorbill: \u03c72=55.35, df=17; all p-values < 210 \n0.001), which indicates heterogeneity in resight probability (\u2018trap dependence\u2019), an effect that 211 \nhas been reported already for puffins at the Isle of May (Harris et al. 2005). Component 3.SR 212 \nfitted well for all 3 species (p-values > 0.9), therefore showing no evidence of individual 213 \nheterogeneity in survival probability, as noted in previous analysis of these species from the 214 \nIsle of May (Harris et al., 2000; Harris et al., 2005; Grosbois et al., 2009). 215 \nThe trap-dependence in resight probability detected for the three species was taken 216 \ninto account in the synchrony models by adding a 1-year trap-dependence structure as follows: 217 \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029Yi,TaYr\nYi,p1\nYi,p\nlogYi,plogit SSS\nS\nS\nS \uf0d7\uf02b\uf03d\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf03d .  (eqn 5) 218 \nFor each species S, the resight probability for individual i in year Y, pS(i,Y), depends through a 219 \nlogit link on a year-specific resight probability rS(Y) and an additive term aS that is only included 220 \nif the individual was resighted in the previous occasion. This is achieved by using the indicator 221 \nfunction TS(i,Y) that can be seen as an individual covariate for each capture occasion. Thus 222 \nTS(i,Y)=1 if bird i was caught in year Y-1, and zero otherwise. The species-specific terms aS 223 \nrepresent the amount of 1-year trap-dependence for each species studied. 224 \nAnalysis of the auk data 225 \nWe applied the method outlined above to investigate the amount of synchronisation in the 226 \nvariation of adult survival for the three auk species at the Isle of May, by jointly analysing their 227 \nmark-resight data. For simplicity, we used the same covariates for all three auk species, but 228 \nthis is, in general, not a restriction and as mentioned above, species-specific covariates could 229 \nbe considered. The vector cov = {c1,c2,c3,c4} = {wNAO_0, wNAO_1, SST_0, SST_1} in the 230 \nmodels hereafter refers to the four covariates together. All covariate time series, between 1984 231 \nand 2008, were standardised prior to inclusion in the models by subtracting the mean of the 232 \nseries and dividing by its standard deviation. We verified that the covariates do not have high 233 \ncorrelation. For adult survival, we considered a logit link function and a linear regression, with 234 \nthe aforementioned set of four standardised covariates cj and corresponding species-specific 235 \nregression coefficients \u03b2jS: 236 \n10 \n \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 (Y)\u03b5\u03b4(Y)Yc\u03b2\u03b2Ylogit S\n4\n1j\njjS0SS \uf02b\uf02b\n\uf0fe\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0d7\uf02b\uf03d \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf066 .   (eqn 6) 237 \nAll models considered in the following sections had fully time-dependent resight probability 238 \nwith 1-year trap-dependence modelled as explained in eqn 5 and these are denoted \u2018p(t+a)\u2019. 239 \nAs the Bayesian approach is more flexible for handling random effects than the 240 \nclassical maximum likelihood framework (Barry et al. 2003), we conducted our study within a 241 \nBayesian framework with MCMC sampling. All models were programmed in WinBUGS 242 \n(Spiegelhalter et al. 2003). The WinBUGS code used to fit the models can be found in the 243 \nonline Supplement. After a burn-in period of 100000 samples, the MCMC chains were run for 244 \n150000 iterations (with a thinning of 3 to reduce the amount of data stored). Convergence was 245 \nassessed with the Gelman-Rubin statistic calculated as modified by Brooks and Gelman 246 \n(1998), after starting 3 chains with dispersed initial values for all variables. The statistic 247 \nsuggests that convergence had been achieved after 100000 samples. Uninformative priors 248 \nwere used for all variables (regression coefficients \u03b2iS ~ U(-5,5); standard deviation of the \u03b4 249 \nand \u03b5 random terms \u03b6x\n ~ U(0,3); year-specific component of resight probabilities rS(Y) ~ 250 \nN(0,10-4); trap-dependence coefficients aS ~ U(-5,5)). We conducted a prior sensitivity study for 251 \nthe random effect variances by specifying conventionally used vague inverse-gamma priors as 252 \nan alternative to uniform priors. 253 \nStarting from the full model {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)} we constructed all of the eight 254 \ncombinations of up to three of the arguments of survival (covariates, \u2018year\u2019 random term \u03b4, 255 \n\u2018year x species\u2019 random terms \u03b5S), or none at all. In the cases when covariates were removed, 256 \na species main effect was kept through a species-specific intercept. For brevity we did not 257 \nattempt a formal model-reduction exercise in terms of reducing the number of individual 258 \ncovariate terms required. We fitted each of the resulting eight models (Table 1) to the auk 259 \nmark-resight data. The models were ranked in terms of their Deviance Information Criterion 260 \n(DIC), a Bayesian analogue of AIC (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002) that balances model fit and 261 \ncomplexity. It is calculated as DIC= D(\u03b8)+2pD, where D(\u03b8), the deviance when using the mean 262 \nof the posterior distribution of the parameters, is penalised by twice the effective number of 263 \nestimated parameters pD. DIC is available directly in WinBUGS, with the best model being the 264 \n11 \n \none with the lowest DIC value. Although its use is controversial in the context of hierarchical 265 \nmodels (Spiegelhalter et al. 2002; Barry et al. 2003; Millar 2009), note that the model ranking 266 \ndoes not affect the analysis of synchrony. 267 \nSimulation study 268 \nWe used simulation to study the performance of the proposed method in fitting a set of data 269 \nderived from known parameters. We selected the full model structure {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)} from 270 \nthe previous section and chose parameter values based on the best model obtained in the Isle 271 \nof May auk study, in order to stay within ecological realism. Mark-resight data were generated 272 \n20 times (the processing time required for the MCMC sampling is prohibitive for a much larger 273 \nsimulation study), matched to values estimated for the three auk species, with the same 274 \nnumber of animals as in the real data set. For each species, each of these data sets differed 275 \nonly in the value of the survival rates, as the random effect terms (both common and species-276 \nspecific) that were added to the linear relationship were generated independently with same 277 \nvariance for each simulated data set. The rest of the parameters were kept unchanged. The 278 \nmodel {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)} was fitted to the 20 data sets using WinBUGS (50000 MCMC 279 \niterations after a burn-in of 100000). We used the medians of the posterior distributions for 280 \neach parameter to calculate the bias, and then averaged over the 20 data sets. 281 \n 282 \nResults 283 \nData analysis 284 \nAccording to the DIC values (Table 1), the best of the eight possible models fitted was the full 285 \nmodel {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)}, where survival depended on the set of covariates but had also 286 \ncommon (\u03b4) and species-specific (\u03b5S) random terms. As expected, the models with covariates 287 \noutperformed the corresponding models with only species main effect (intercept). In both 288 \ncases, with and without covariates, the inclusion of any kind of random effects gave a 289 \nsubstantial improvement in terms of DIC, and having both common and species-specific 290 \nrandom terms was better than having either in isolation.  291 \n12 \n \nPrior sensitivity was tested for the best model using alternative priors. In particular, the 292 \nuse of inverse-gamma priors for the random effect variances appeared to be slightly more 293 \ninformative than specifying uniforms for their standard deviation, and the posterior distributions 294 \nwere sensitive to the choice of the gamma distribution parameters, as it has been noted in 295 \nprevious studies (Royle 2008). This was particularly the case for razorbills, the species with 296 \nleast data. These results support the selection of uniform priors for these parameters. 297 \n 298 \n[Table1_about_here] 299 \n 300 \nConcentrating on the full model {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)}, estimated survival probabilities 301 \n(Fig. 1) differed substantially for the three species, although most values remained relatively 302 \nhigh (above 0.8 or even above 0.9 for puffins and guillemots), as is typical for long-lived 303 \nseabirds. Note that the size of the 95% credible intervals reflected the amount of data 304 \navailable for each species, being wider for razorbill (153 birds) and very narrow for guillemots 305 \n(831 birds). Survival was relatively stable over the years for guillemots, showed wider variation 306 \nfor razorbills, with pronounced peaks in a few particular years, while estimates for puffins were 307 \nintermediate. 308 \n 309 \n[Figures1&2_about_here] 310 \n 311 \nThe trap-dependence coefficients (aS in eqn 5) were all positive for the three species 312 \nand therefore the probability of seeing a bird was higher if it was seen the previous year. Using 313 \nthe estimates of aS and rS we calculated the estimated resight probabilities for the three 314 \nspecies, for the case when a bird was seen the year before, and for when it was not (Fig. 2). 315 \nNotice that resight probability is 1 for the three species in the last year. When the study was 316 \nrepeated excluding 2008, this effect appeared again associated to the last year, in this case 317 \n2007. We conclude that, as with the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in which the final year\u2019s 318 \nsurvival and recapture probability are not identifiable, the survival estimates for the last year 319 \nshould be discarded, as they are biased low due to the artificially high recapture probability. In 320 \n13 \n \nthe case of razorbill, four other years had resight probabilities estimated to be 1. The number 321 \nof marked razorbills was substantially lower than for the two other species, and these 322 \nestimates reflect years for which all birds known to be alive the previous year were either seen 323 \nor never seen again. Regarding the boundary estimates in later years, note that the future 324 \nresight of even one bird alive but missed in these years will remove the estimates from the 325 \nboundary, and the correlated survival rates will rise as a consequence. 326 \nTable 2 shows the regression coefficients for the full model, {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)}. Most 327 \nof the point estimates were below zero, denoting a negative relationship between adult 328 \nsurvival and the covariate represented. Note that some of the 95% credible intervals spanned 329 \nboth sides of 0. In the particular case of 1-year time-lagged SST for razorbill, the 330 \ncorresponding beta was very close to zero, indicating a lack of strong influence of that 331 \ncovariate on razorbill survival. The fact that some of the regression coefficients corresponding 332 \nto the time-lagged versions of wNAO and SST were far from zero indicated that they also had 333 \nan indirect effect on adult survival, acting possibly through the food chain (Harris et al. 2005; 334 \nSandvik et al. 2005). 335 \n[Table2_about_here] 336 \n 337 \nInterspecific synchrony (ICCS) and the fraction of variation accounted for by the 338 \ncovariates for each species (C\u03b4 and Cs terms) were calculated from the estimates of the full 339 \nmodel {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)} and the \u2018species main effect\u2019 model {\u03a6(S+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)} (Table 3). 340 \n 341 \n[Table3_about_here] 342 \n 343 \nFor the model with covariates, the residual variances of the species-specific random terms 344 \n(res)\u03b6\u02c62s  were all substantially lower than that of the common random term (res)\u03b6\u02c6\n2\n\u03b4  which is 345 \nalso noticeable when looking at the estimates of the random terms for each year of the study 346 \n(Fig. 3). As a result, all three ICCS values were high. These values suggested that for puffin, 347 \n14 \n \nguillemot and razorbill, most of the variation unexplained by the environmental covariates used 348 \nin this study was synchronous to the three species.  349 \n[Fig.3_about_here] 350 \n 351 \nIn the \u2018species main effect\u2019 model, all (total)\u03b6\u02c62s and (total)\u03b6\u02c6\n2\n\u03b4 variances increased compared to 352 \nthe model with covariates, to accommodate the extra variation created by the lack of 353 \ncovariates. The species-specific variances increased more, in proportion, and therefore the 354 \nICCS terms decreased to below 80%. 355 \nThe fraction of the synchronous variance accounted for by the set of covariates (C\u03b4) 356 \nwas around 26%, that is, about one fourth of the variation that is synchronous to the three auk 357 \nspecies was explained by components of the climate related to wNAO and SST. Climate is 358 \nacting to some extent as a synchronising agent in the survival of puffins, guillemots and 359 \nrazorbills but there is still about 75% of synchronous variation among species that is not 360 \nexplained by these covariates. The environmental covariates were also responsible for a large 361 \npart of the asynchronous variation, as shown by the values of the sC coefficients. For puffins 362 \nand razorbills, the values were very high (\u224881% and 60% respectively), implying that most of 363 \nthe between-year variation asynchronous to the other auk species was related to these 364 \nclimatic covariates. For guillemots on the other hand, less than half of the asynchronous 365 \nvariation in adult survival was explained by these covariates. Thus it appears that the same 366 \nclimatic factors can act simultaneously as synchronising and desynchronising agents for adult 367 \nsurvival of these species at the Isle of May. There is some indication that both wNAO and SST 368 \ncan act indirectly on survival (Harris et al. 2005). It is therefore possible that the oceanographic 369 \neffects reflected in wNAO and SST can act through different indirect causation paths, some of 370 \nthem affecting the three species in synchrony, some others affecting them differently or only 371 \naffecting some of the species.  372 \n15 \n \nSimulations 373 \nWe obtained the average over the 20 simulated data sets of the median value of each 374 \nparameter (Table 4). 375 \n[Table4_about_here] 376 \n 377 \nBias was calculated as the average over the 20 simulations of the absolute value of the 378 \ndifference between the point estimate (median) and the true value. It was generally small for 379 \nthe regression and trap-dependence coefficients. The largest values appeared with the 380 \nestimation of the variance of the random effects. In relation to the species-specific random 381 \nterms, it is worth noting that as expected the largest bias was associated with the species with 382 \nleast data (razorbill, 153 marked individuals) while the smallest corresponds to guillemots (with 383 \n831 birds). These differences disappeared when the simulations were repeated with 831 384 \nindividuals for each of the three species. Bias in survival estimates was in almost all cases 385 \nbelow 3% and was again in general largest for razorbills (smallest data set) and smallest for 386 \nguillemots (largest data set).  387 \n 388 \nDiscussion 389 \nThis paper presents a model, fitted using Bayesian methodology, for studying synchrony in 390 \nadult survival between several species, and the contribution of environmental covariates as 391 \nsynchronising and desynchronising agents, adapting the framework used for a multi-392 \npopulation study by Grosbois et al. (2009) to the multi-species situation. This method does not 393 \ndirectly shed light into the typically complex mechanisms that underlie the observed 394 \nsynchronisation or desynchronisation between different species, but it can be used to provide 395 \ninsight into community dynamics and to point out further avenues of investigation in terms of 396 \nenvironmental covariates. 397 \nAuk survival at the Isle of May 398 \nThe survival estimates obtained in our study with the best model {\u03a6(cov+\u03b4+\u03b5)p(t+a)} are 399 \nconsistent with previous analyses of the three species individually (Harris et al. 2000; Harris et 400 \n16 \n \nal. 2005; Reynolds et al. 2009). However estimates of a species\u2019 survival from a more 401 \nintegrated study have the potential for borrowing strength from the rest of the ensemble, with 402 \nthe consequent gain in precision. In this study, some of the regression coefficients seem to 403 \npoint to the existence of indirect environmental effects, possibly through the food web, as 404 \nnoted in Sandvik et al. (2005): regression coefficients were negative for SST with no delay and 405 \nothers with 1-year lag  were not zero. Some of the estimated regression coefficients were low 406 \nand had 95% credible intervals that included zero, possibly pointing to a lack of a strong 407 \ninfluence of the corresponding environmental covariates on that particular species\u2019 survival. 408 \nWe did not attempt a systematic covariate selection process prior to the modelling as the 409 \nprimary aim at this stage was to develop the statistical model for studying multi-species 410 \nsynchrony and demonstrate the potential of this framework. 411 \nThere was a significant proportion of variance not explained by our set of four 412 \ncovariates, which indicates that there is scope for further investigation. This may include the 413 \nexisting environmental covariates with longer time lags (Harris et al. 2005) or averaged over 414 \ndifferent periods of the year or broader areas in which auks overwinter (Sandvik et al. 2005). 415 \nBiotic covariates, like prey stock estimates (Harris et al. 1997) could also be considered, as 416 \nwell as non-linear or non-parametric relationships with the covariates (Gimenez et al. 2006) 417 \nThese covariates will be the object of further exploration of this data set, with a focus on the 418 \necology of these auk species. Our study lays the methodological groundwork for this. 419 \nFuture developments of the framework 420 \nA number of interesting generalisations can be considered for the framework presented by 421 \nGrosbois et al. (2009) for the multi-colony case and extended in this study for multi-species 422 \nsynchrony. Firstly, the framework of using species-specific and common random effect terms 423 \ncould be adapted to other demographic parameters, as already suggested by Grosbois et al. 424 \n(2009) for the multi-population situation. The natural next step would be to consider synchrony 425 \nin several demographic parameters by analysing them together and potentially incorporating 426 \ntime-series of abundance, in an integrated population modelling framework (Besbeas et al. 427 \n2005). The joint likelihood of such analysis would extend over demographic parameters as 428 \n17 \n \nwell as over different species, an analysis that to our knowledge has not been done to date. 429 \nApart from the inherent benefits of the integrated modelling, the partition of variation into 430 \nsynchronous and asynchronous components could be carried out for each of the demographic 431 \nparameters used, in the same fashion as was done here for adult survival. The 432 \nsynchrony\/asynchrony of the response to the environmental covariates could be 433 \nsimultaneously assessed across species for different life history traits. Conversely, synchrony 434 \nin different demographic rates could be studied for a single species, investigating for example 435 \nif juvenile and adult survival are synchronous and if climate contributes to this effect. 436 \nFew studies address spatial and temporal synchrony simultaneously (but see Swanson 437 \n& Johnson (1999)). For survival, such a situation could be tackled with a multi-species multi-438 \npopulation framework, combining the model proposed by Grosbois et al. (2009) with that of 439 \nours: 440 \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 (Y)\u03b5Y\u03b3Y\u03bb\u03b4(Y)(Y)c , ... (Y),cfYlink SPPSSPnSP1SPSP SP \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\uf066 .     (eqn 7) 441 \nSurvival \u03a6SP(Y) from year Y to Y+1 for species S in site P would be related through the logit 442 \nlink function to a species-and-site-specific function fSP(.) of a set of nSP environmental 443 \ncovariates cSPi(Y) and random effects. In this case, these would include an overall common 444 \nterm \u03b4(Y), terms specific to species \u03bbS(Y) and sites \u03b3P(Y), and finally species-and-site-specific 445 \nterms \u03b5SP(Y). The number of parameters to be estimated increases compared to the multi-446 \nspecies or multi-colony cases, and we can expect the requirements in terms of amount of data 447 \nneeded to be able to estimate the parameters to increase. 448 \nThe alternative parameterisation proposed as a generalisation of the multi-population 449 \nmodel (Grosbois et al. 2009, eqn 1) can also be adopted in the multi-species framework we 450 \npresent, allowing the incorporation of covariates into the species-specific partition of variance 451 \nbetween synchronous and asynchronous components. When mechanistic hypotheses about 452 \ninterspecific relations exist, it could be worth considering applying the framework presented 453 \nhere to models that take into account these interactions explicitly (see New (2009) for an 454 \nexample of state-space multi-species model with predator-prey interaction).  455 \n18 \n \nFinally, the application of random effects to study multi-species synchrony could be 456 \nexplored for other types of data beyond mark-recapture. One example is occupancy models 457 \n(MacKenzie et al. 2006) where detection\/non-detection data of an unmarked species are used 458 \nto estimate the percentage of sampled sites where the species is present, taking into account 459 \nimperfect detection. In a similar fashion to that in eqn 1, data from several species sampled at 460 \nthe same sites could be modelled together, adding common and species-specific random 461 \neffects terms to account for the between-site variation not accounted for by a set of covariates: 462 \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029 (i)\u03b5\u03b4(i)(i)c , ... (i),cfi\u03a8logit SnSS1SS s \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d .   (eqn 8) 463 \nIn this case, \u03a8S(i) (the probability of site i being occupied by species S) depends through a 464 \nlogit link function on a set of covariates cSj(i) and two random terms. The variance \n2\n\u03b4\u03b6  of the 465 \ncommon terms \u03b4(i) represents the variation of occupancy across sites that is synchronous to 466 \nall species considered, while the variances\n2\ns\u03b6 of the species-specific terms \u03b5S(i) correspond to 467 \nthe asynchronous components. The derivation of indices of synchrony and the contribution of 468 \nthe covariates in synchronising and desynchronising occupancy across sites is then 469 \nstraightforward. The number of sites is usually large compared to the number of years 470 \navailable in typical mark-recapture studies, facilitating the characterisation of the random effect 471 \nvariances. We note that multispecies occupancy models have already been proposed to study 472 \ncommunities (e.g., Russell et al. 2009) although not specifically targeted to investigate 473 \nsynchrony in occupancy. 474 \nConclusion 475 \nImproved understanding of how the environment synchronises and desynchronises 476 \ndemographic parameters can be of great value in generating ecological hypotheses, especially 477 \nwhen coupled with biological knowledge of these species. Links between demography and 478 \nenvironmental conditions are complex, with variables acting simultaneously as synchronising 479 \nand desynchronising agents. For example, in the case of the auks considered here, it is likely 480 \nthat to understand the processes involved, more information will have to be incorporated. The 481 \nresults of synchrony could be related to similarities in wintering grounds, as new research 482 \nclarifies the picture of where these birds spend the winter months (Harris et al. 2009). Models 483 \n19 \n \nlike the one presented by Grosbois et al. (2009) for multi-populations and its adaptation for 484 \nmulti-species introduced in this paper represent new steps towards more integrative 485 \napproaches to study demographic parameters. Methods to study multi-species relations are 486 \nurgently needed given the changing environmental conditions and may play an important role 487 \nin increasing our understanding of how climate change may affect communities\u2019 composition, 488 \nas sympatric species react in similar or different ways to changes in their environment. 489 \nAcknowledgements 490 \nJJL-M was supported by a grant provided by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the 491 \nEPSRC National Centre for Statistical Ecology.
