The quantum\nconfinement of electrons along the tube circumference\nyields a rich variety in conductivities with the chirality\ndetermining its metallic or semiconducting nature [2]. The\nelectronic structure is intimately related to its atomic con-\nfiguration [3\u20136]. In order for carbon nanotubes to fulfill\ntheir promise as electronic materials, that encompass their\nproperties such as ballistic conduction [7] and high current\ndensity [8,9], their synthesis, purification, and functional-\nization need to be addressed. Remarkable progress in their\npurification, such as the separation of metallic and semi-\nconducting tubes, has taken place [10,11]. Besides such\nchirality separations, doping of SWCNTs with atoms or\nmolecules is a promising means to tune their bulk elec-\ntronic properties. Doping through the van Hove singularity\n(VHS) can efficiently modulate the conductivity of\nSWCNTs [12,13]. Electron doping of SWCNT bundles\nby alkali metal intercalation results in a transition from a\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a Fermi liquid [14,15]. The\nexcellent structural and chemical integrity of carbon nano-\ntubes provides an ideal 1D environment with which to\nexplore chemistry at the nanoscale [16\u201324]. Such nano-\nchemistry allows tweaking the doping level of encapsulat-\ning metallic SWCNTs [25,26]. These facts highlight the\nversatility of SWCNTs as a fundamental component for\nelectronic devices and as a route for the quest for improved\nunderstanding in chemistry and solid state physics.\nIn this Letter, we report on the doping of SWCNTs\nby cerium compounds. Tris(cyclopentadienyl)cerium\n(CeCp3), which consists of three cyclopentadienyl rings\n(Cp), bound to a central cerium atom, is used as a precursor\nfor cerium encapsulation within SWCNTs. We demon-\nstrate that the encapsulated chemical reaction enables elec-\ntron doping through the VHS of SWCNT.\nClear evidence for filling is provided by Raman spec-\ntroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),\nboth of which show the transition of the encapsulated\nCeCp3 into innershell tubes upon annealing. On the con-\nversion, electron doping of the encapsulating semiconduct-\ning tube is observed as vanishing VHS peaks in the C 1s\nabsorption spectra and as the appearance of the carbon\nFermi edge in the valence-band photoemission spectra.\nMoreover, two additional features appear near the C 1s\nabsorption onset at high doping, which we attribute to the\nVHS peaks of the original semiconducting tubes with\nenhanced core hole screening due to their transition to\nmetallic tubes.\nThe SWCNT material was synthesized by laser ablation\nand purified by an H2O2 treatment [27]. The purified tube\nmaterial and CeCp3 powder were sealed in an evacuated\nPyrex tube and annealed up to 200 \u0002C for 24 h. After this\nprocess the tube material was thoroughly rinsed by soni-\ncating in acetone multiple times. Finally, a bucky film was\npeeled off the filter. Raman spectroscopy was carried out\nusing a Bruker FT Raman spectrometer with a wavelength\nof 1064 nm. X-ray absorption experiments were conducted\nat the synchrotron beam line UE 52 PGM, Bessy II. Either\ndrain current or partial electron yield was collected with an\noverall resolving power better than 10 000. Resonance\nphotoemission spectroscopy was performed by using a\nhemispherical SCIENTA SES 200 photoelectron energy\nPRL 102, 046804 (2009) P HY S I CA L R EV I EW LE T T E R S\nweek ending\n30 JANUARY 2009\n0031-9007=09=102(4)=046804(4) 046804-1 \u0001 2009 The American Physical Society\nanalyzer. The experimental resolution and the Fermi en-\nergy were determined from the Fermi edge of an in situ\ndeposited Au film or clean molybdenum substrate. The\nbase pressure in the setup was maintained below 5\u0003\n10\u000110 mbar.\nThe left-hand panel of Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra\nof a CeCp3 filled SWCNT sample before and after anneal-\ning at 1000 \u0002C in vacuum. Both spectra contain the ex-\npected radial breathing modes of pristine tubes at\nfrequencies ranging from 130 to 210 cm\u00011. After anneal-\ning, sharp lines appear in the range of 300\u2013370 cm\u00011,\ncorresponding to the formation of inner tubes and, hence,\nevidence CeCp3 encapsulation within the SWCNT.\nHRTEM observations provide us further insight into the\nchemical identity of the filling. The right-hand top panel\nof Fig. 1 confirms a typical micrograph of the\nCeCp3@SWCNT in which arrays of contrast correspond-\ning to encapsulated CeCp3 molecules are easily discerned\nwithin the tube walls. The middle and bottom panels show\nHRTEM micrographs of the sample transformed into\ndouble-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNT) containing ce-\nrium (Ce@DWCNT). The undulating lines observed in\nbetween the outer tube wall indicate an inner tube, while\nthe dark dots are from cerium ions.\nResonance photoemission spectroscopy can extract ele-\nment specific electronic information of compounds. With a\nphoton energy in resonance with the Ce core absorption\nedge, the partial electronic states of cerium are predomi-\nnantly observed in the valence-band photoemission spec-\ntrum. Conversely, when off resonance, the nanotube carbon\nvalence states dominate in our case. In Fig. 2(a), we\ncompare the Ce 3d! 4f on-resonance photoemission\nspectra of the pristine and annealed CeCp3 filled\nSWCNT. Both spectra are, as a whole, very similar to\neach other and exhibit a peak corresponding to the Ce\n4f1 ! 4f0 transition at a binding energy of 2 eV. In con-\ntrast, the off-resonance spectra exhibit striking differences\nas shown in Fig. 2(b). After annealing, the photoemission\nintensities near the Fermi level are significantly increased.\nThis is better observed from the Ce 4d! 4f resonance at a\nhigher resolution. Expanding the Ce 4d! 4f off-\nresonance spectrum close to the Fermi energy region in\nthe main panel of Fig. 2(c), one can easily see the Fermi\nedge for the annealed sample (Ce@DWCNT). The fact that\nthere is no corresponding Ce 4f peak observed in the off-\nresonance spectra validates the off-resonance condition\nboth at the Ce 3d and 4d edges. This confirms that the\nchanges are associated with the Fermi edge of the carbon\nvalence band. Electron doping of SWCNT bundles up to\nthe S?1 level induces a transition from the Tomonaga-\nLuttinger liquid state to the Fermi liquid state due to an\nincrease in tube-tube interactions within bundles, as was\nshown for potassium intercalated SWCNT [15]. Our case\ncan therefore be interpreted as electron doping filling states\nabove the S?1 level and provides direct evidence for the\nenhanced conductivity of the SWCNT bundles by cerium\ndoping. This doping takes place equally in the filled\nSWCNTs, but not in the unfilled SWCNTs, enabling se-\nlective doping which is crucial for understanding the fol-\nlowing analysis of the C 1s excitations.\nFigure 3(a) shows the x-ray absorption spectra for pris-\ntine and annealed CeCp3 filled SWCNT at the C 1s! \u0001?\nexcitation region. The pristine CeCp3@SWCNT shows\ndiscernible fine structures corresponding to the unoccupied\nS?1 , S\n?\n2 , M\n?\n1 , and S\n?\n3 VHS peaks, very similar to empty\nSWCNT [25,28]. Upon annealing the S?1 and S\n?\n2 are sig-\nnificantly suppressed due to electron doping of the semi-\nFIG. 1 (color online).

Furthermore, examining the low\nenergy tail of the C 1s absorption edge, two structures\ncan be observed near the onset of the \u0001? peak for the\nCe@DWCNT [indicated by the vertical bars, SM?1 and\nSM?2 ]. Importantly, the appearance of these two structures\ncoincides with the disappearance of the S?1 and S\n?\n2 peaks.\nFrom this fact, it is likely that these two features have the\nsame origin, i.e., a sudden energy leap of the S?1 and S\n?\n2\npeaks to the SM?1 and S\nM?\n2 . The corresponding C 1s pho-\ntoemission spectra are shown in Fig. 3(b). The main peak\nof CeCp3@SWCNT is located at a binding energy of\n284.6 eV, the same as for the pristine SWCNT. In contrast,\nthe C 1s peaks for the annealed samples show significant\nenergy shifts to lower binding energies, that are about\n0.1 eV after annealing at 800 \u0002C for 2 h (intermediate)\nand 0.3 eV for the Ce@DWCNT. The inset shows clearly\nthat this monotonic energy shift is triggered by annealing.\nThe C 1s absorption spectrum of Ce@DWCNT is com-\nposed of the \u0001 and \u0002 structures of sp2 carbon, essentially\nvery similar to the pristine SWCNT. From this information\nit is possible to exclude chemical shifts. Such energy shifts\ncan occur when the photoabsorption final state energy is\nlowered. The final state energy of the core-level photo-\nemission process is dominated by the screening of the core\nhole potential. In general, the more conduction electrons\navailable, the stronger the expected screening. In our case,\nthe enhanced conductivity by doping can yield stronger\nscreening of the core hole potential, which explains the\nlower energy of the C 1s photoemission peak for the\nCe@DWCNT sample.\nIn turn, upon C 1s! \u0001? near edge absorption of a\nSWCNT, an incoming photon excites one electron from\nthe C 1s core level to the unoccupied\u0001? state, as illustrated\nin the left-hand panel of Fig. 3(c). The final state of this\nprocess includes one hole (h\u00fe) at the C 1s and one electron\n(e\u0001) at the previously unoccupied state. In the case of\nsemiconducting tubes, excitons are the quasiparticles\nwhich lower the energy of the excited state. When the\nsemiconducting tubes become metallic, the excitons are\nno longer stable for a reasonable lifetime. From this pic-\nture, the final state of the doped semiconducting tubes, now\nmetallic, should increase in energy. This is the opposite of\nwhat is observed. Some other effect lowering the final\nenergy state with a reasonable energy scale is required.\nCore hole screening can once again be applied to explain\nthe above observation. In the core absorption process, both\nthe excited electron and other available conduction elec-\ntrons are responsible for screening the created core hole in\nthe final state. The absorption threshold energy depends on\nthe availability of conduction electrons [29]. For semi-\nconducting tubes, the photoexcited electrons are respon-\nsible for screening the core hole (self-screening). If such a\ntube couples with the adjacent metallic tubes, the core hole\ncan effectively be screened by the conduction electrons\n(metal screening). It has been reported that the interactions\nbetween different chirality tubes, especially between the\nsemiconducting and metallic tubes, are rather weak so that\nthe Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state can be observed in\nmetallic tubes in bundles at low temperatures [14]. This\nmeans self-screening should dominate metal screening in\nsemiconducting tubes in a bundle. When these semicon-\nducting tubes become metallic by doping, self-screening is\nno longer dominant due to the strong scattering of the\nexcited electrons in the conduction band. Instead, all con-\nduction electrons are now responsible for the core hole\nscreening. In this case the incident is a many body effect\nover the whole conduction band and the screening effect\nbecomes much stronger so as to lower the total energy of\nthe photoexcited electron system.\nIn the right-hand panel of Fig. 3(c), the results of a peak\nfit analysis of the C 1s absorption spectra are presented.\nFIG. 3 (color online).

The vertical arrow indicates\nchemical-reaction-induced doping of the conduction states of tubes. The blue and red curves are the results of fitting for the S?1 and S\nM?\n1\nusing the equations f1\u00f0\u0003\u00de \u00bc C\u00f01\u00fe \u0003\u00de\u00011 and f2\u00f0\u0003\u00de \u00bc C\u0003\u00f01\u00fe \u0003\u00de\u00011, respectively, where C \u00bc const and \u0003 \u00bc SM?1 =S?1 . The open\ncircles, D1 and D2, indicate the crossing points between S\n?\nn and S\nM?\nn (n \u00bc 1; 2) and correspond to the doping levels at the S?1 and S?2\npeaks in the density of states, respectively.\nPRL 102, 046804 (2009) P HY S I CA L R EV I EW LE T T E R S\nweek ending\n30 JANUARY 2009\n046804-3\nThe area intensities of the VHS peaks, S?1 , S\n?\n2 , M\n?\n1 , S\nM?\n1 ,\nand SM?2 , were normalized against the M\n?\n1 intensity and\nplotted as a function of the intensity ratio SM?1 =S\n?\n1 . In this\ncase, the vertical axis, SM?1 =S\n?\n1 , represents the doping level\nof the tubes increased by CeCp3 filling and subsequent\nannealing. It shows that the SM?1 peak can be resolved even\nfor pristine CeCp3@SWCNT. The presence of electron\ndoping from CeCp3 to the tubes can be expected based\non a previous study on ferrocene filled SWCNT. Upon\nannealing further, suppression of the S?1 and S\n?\n2 peak\nintensities concomitant with the rising intensities of the\nSM?1 and S\nM?\n2 peaks are observed. Assuming that the sum of\nthe S?1 and S\nM?\n1 is constant and S\n?\n1 \u00fe SM?1 \u00bc C, we obtain a\nsimple equation for the S?1 and S\nM?\n1 intensities, f1\u00f0\u0003\u00de \u00bc\nC\u00f01\u00fe \u0003\u00de\u00011 and f2\u00f0\u0003\u00de \u00bc C\u0003\u00f01\u00fe \u0003\u00de\u00011, respectively,\nwhere \u0003 \u00bc SM?1 =S?1 . The corresponding data fit well to\nthese functions [see the S?1 (blue) and S\nM?\n1 (red) curves in\nthe right-hand panel of Fig. 3(c)]. This strongly supports\nour assignment for the SM?n (n \u00bc 1; 2) peaks. At the cross-\ning point of these two curves, the S?1 and S\nM?\n1 have the\nsame intensity. At this doping level half the original S?1\npeak is filled. This idea should also hold for the S?2 peak\nand is illustrated in the right-hand panel of Fig. 3(c), where\nthe crossing points,D1 andD2, are correlated to the S\n?\n1 and\nS?2 peaks in the density of states.\nThis analysis is consistent with the sudden energy leap\nin VHS peaks from semiconducting tubes as a consequence\nof the transition to a doping induced metallic phase. Since\nthe semiconducting gap and chemical potential depend on\nthe chirality of the tubes, doping of each semiconducting\ntube is not a simultaneous event. This is the reason why\nboth the SM?1 and S\nM?\n2 peaks are observed at moderate\ndoping levels.\nCeCp3 encapsulating SWCNT is used as a template for\nnanochemistry to achieve doping through the VHS of\nencapsulating SWCNT. From an extended element spe-\ncific analysis using resonance core-level spectroscopy,\nwe provide evidence for massively enhanced conduc-\ntivity of doped SWCNT. The enhanced density of con-\nduction electrons heightens core hole screening of the\ninitial semiconducting tubes. This fact illustrates the im-\nportance of many body effects in carbon nanotubes. Nano-\ntest-tube chemistry provides for the use of 1D quantized\nelectronic levels of carbon nanotubes to manipulate physi-\ncal properties and monitor the chemical process in a con-\nfined space. Hence, this work opens a pathway for\nchallenging fundamental issues in correlated 1D electronic\nsystems.\nWe thank EPSRC, U.K., for financial support through a\nPortfolio Partnership grant. H.
