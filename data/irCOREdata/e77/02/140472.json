The energy required for Linear\nFriction Welding is an important issue due to economic and environmental reasons, but is not\ncurrently fully understood. This paper describes a comprehensive evaluation of the energy\ninput during Linear Friction Welding of a medium carbon steel with different process\nparameters. This calculation is based on an analysis of force and displacement data from the\nmachine, which takes momentum into account. The analysis shows that energy input to the\nweld is minimised with high frequencies and rubbing velocities, however there is a\nconsiderable amount of energy lost in oscillating the machine tooling under these conditions.\nFurthermore, analysis of the force indicates that a peak load occurs just prior to the samples\nbeing aligned which is probably caused by ploughing of the samples during welding.\n31 Introduction\nLinear friction welding (LFW) has many advantages over conventional welding processes. It\nis robust, repeatable, fast, and is capable of producing high quality joints in many engineering\nmetals and metal combinations. Despite these benefits, the number of industrial applications is\nlimited and confined to the aerospace industry. Hence the number of published articles on this\ntopic is relatively small, and those available focus on describing the process1-3, modelling 2,4-6,\nmicrostructure and characterisation7,8 and residual stress measurement 9-11. Due to the process\nbeing applied primarily to titanium alloys, most articles relate to the welding of this material,\nalthough there are exceptions7.\nThe LFW process works by holding one component stationary and oscillating another\ncomponent against it under an applied load1,3,9. This is shown in the schematic diagram of the\nequipment used for the process in Fig. 1(a). The motion between the parts generates heat\nwhich causes the material at the interface to plasticise and soften. As the process progresses,\nthe applied load causes extrusion of the material from the joint, and any surface impurities are\nremoved in the flash. One of the advantages of this process is that the parts can be of arbitrary\nshape, unlike the related process of rotary friction welding where the parts must be cylindrical.\nMuch of the early reported work on the process was performed by Vairis and Frost1,2,4, and\ndescribes how the process may be divided into four phases:\n\uf0b7 Phase I \u2013 Initial phase. During this phase heat is produced by columbic friction\nbetween the rubbing surfaces. Asperity contact exists between the two surfaces, and as\nheat is generated, the asperities soften and deform, increasing the true area of contact\nbetween the parts.\n\uf0b7 Phase II \u2013 Transition phase. During this phase the true area of contact increases to\n100% of the cross-sectional area. This transition is accompanied by an increase in the\nforce required to oscillate the parts.\n\uf0b7 Phase III \u2013 Equilibrium phase. During this phase the shear force reaches a steady state\nvalue and significant axial shortening occurs through the generation of flash. The\nplastic zone gets progressively larger during this phase.\n\uf0b7 Phase IV \u2013 Deceleration phase. The relative motion is ceased and the two parts are\naligned. In some applications an additional forging force may also be applied.\nAddison3 classifies these phases slightly differently and divides them into conditioning (phase\nI), friction (phases II and III) and forge (phase IV).\nAlthough attempts have been made to predict the energy input from either simple formulas or\nfrom model predictions1,2,4,5,8, no authors have yet demonstrated how it may be calculated from\nthe force and displacement measurements from the machine. The energy input is crucial to\nwhether successful welding conditions are achieved1,4. In addition, the energy usage of the\nprocess is of interest due to both economic and environmental reasons. Therefore the\nobjectives of this study were:\n\uf0b7 Perform a systematic set of experiments at different frequencies and rubbing velocities\nto determine how these parameters affect the heat generation and whether successful\nwelds are produced.\n\uf0b7 Use this data to determine the most efficient approach for LFW in this case.\n42 Methodology\n2.1 Experimental\nThe experiments used a hydraulically operated LFW machine at TWI, Cambridge. Fig. 1(a) is\na schematic diagram which explains how it works. The core of the machine is a 200kN\nhydraulic servo actuator situated on top of the machine which is connected to an oscillating\ncarriage suspended within hydrostatic bearings. The stationary tooling is connected to a\nsecond hydraulic cylinder which is used to apply the friction pressure to the sample. The\nmaterial used for the experiments was BS 970-3:1991 80M40 steel, with dimensions 63.5mm x\n12.7mm x 75\u00b11mm. Hydraulically operated clamps were used to hold the samples in position.\nThere are a number of devices on the machine for process monitoring which include:\n\uf0b7 Oscillator position, x by linear variable displacement transducer;\n\uf0b7 Oscillation in-plane load, Fl by a load cell between the servo actuator and oscillating\ntooling;\n\uf0b7 Axial position, y by LVDT on the machine table;\n\uf0b7 Axial load, Fa by load cell between the actuator and machine table and pressure\ntransducer in the hydraulic system.\nA constant friction pressure of 125 MPa corresponding to a force of 100.8 kN for the\n12.7\u00d763.5 mm specimens was applied to all of the welding samples. A constant burn-off\ndistance of 3.5 mm was used for all the specimens. In the experimental programme, the\noscillation frequency and amplitude were varied, to give peak rubbing velocities of 470, 549,\n710 and 863 mm s-1. These correspond to average rubbing velocities of 300, 350, 450 and 550\nmm s-1. The maximum rubbing velocity was determined by assuming sinusoidal motion of the\noscillating workpiece, so the displacement, x can be approximated by12:\n\uf028 \uf029\uf064\uf077 \uf02b\uf03d tAx sin (1)\nWhere A is amplitude of oscillation, \u03c9 is angular velocity and equals 2\u03c0f, f being the\nfrequency of oscillation and \u03b4 is the phase shift. This equation is differentiated with respect to\ntime to determine the velocity, v.\n\uf028 \uf029\uf064\uf077\uf077 \uf02b\uf03d\uf03d tA\ndt\ndx\nv cos\n(2)\nHence, the maximum velocity may be given by:\nfAv \uf0702max \uf03d (3)\nFig. 2 shows the parameters that were used to achieve the four rubbing velocities. Four welds\nwere made at each condition to investigate the consistency of the process.\n2.2 Analysis of Energy Input\nThe energy going into each weld can be determined from the load cell and displacement\nmeasurements made by the machine. However, as shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 1(a)\nthe load is not being measured at the sample, but rather between the tooling and the servo\nactuator. The energy going into the sample requires the force at the sample interface, Fint to be\ndetermined, which is shown in Fig. 1(b).\nThe instantaneous power, q\uf026 going into the sample is given by:\n5vFq int\uf03d\uf026 (4)\nTo calculate the total energy, Ex to make the weld, the instantaneous power is integrated over\nthe weld duration:\n\uf0f2\uf0f2 \uf03d\uf03d TTx vdtFdtqE 0 int0 \uf026 (5)\nTo calculate the force at the interface, a free body analysis of the oscillating tooling in Fig. 1(b)\ngives:\nMaFF l \uf02d\uf03dint (6)\nThe positive force convention is shown on Fig. 1(b). Note that while Fl is positive downwards,\nFint is positive upwards. In addition, the mass M of the oscillating system equals 224 kg. This\nvalue is compared with the energy that goes into the oscillating system:\n\uf0f2\uf03d T lvdtFE 00 (7)\nThe preceding analysis requires estimates of both the velocity and the acceleration. This can be\nachieved numerically in a straightforward manner, once the position at different discrete values in\ntime is known. Hence, for the velocity a simple two-point, central finite difference approximation\nis used for the first order derivative13, i.e:\n\uf028 \uf029201 2\n1\nxx\nh\nv \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d (8)\nWhere v1 is the velocity at a point in time (the \u201cpresent time level\u201d denoted 1), x0 and x2\nare the positions at the previous and future time levels and h is the time step size. Similarly the\nacceleration can be found from a three-point central finite difference for the second order\nderivative:\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d 2 0121\n2\nh\nxxx\na (9)\nWhere x1 is the position at the present time level. Alternatively, if the displacement is sinusoidal\nthe acceleration can be determined from the second derivative of the displacement in equation\n(1):\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 xfxtAa 222 2sin \uf070\uf077\uf064\uf077\uf077 \uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf03d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d (10)\nThe preceding analysis has assumed:\n\uf0b7 Friction from the hydrostatic bearings supporting the tooling is negligible.\n\uf0b7 Movement of the samples in the tooling is minimal.\n\uf0b7 The energy going into the specimen from the burn-off can be ignored.\n3 Results and Discussion\n3.1 Conditions that Gave Good Welds\nFig. 2 shows the conditions that were attempted and highlights those conditions that did not\nproduce successful welds. In some cases the cause of the unsatisfactory weld was unsuitable\nwelding conditions for the material being welded, and in other cases the machine struggled to\nproduce welds at the parameters selected. Both cases involved high frequency settings.\nVisual inspection of all the successfully welded test samples showed uniform and sound\nwelded joints. The flash distribution was symmetric and even on both sides of the joint with the\nlarger length being in the direction of oscillation. The flash was joined around the corners of all\nof the successfully welded samples. It was also observed that the thickness of extruded flash\n6was not uniform but took the shape of ridges. These observations have also been made by\nVairis and Frost1,2.\n3.2 General Curves of Force, Displacement and Burn-Off\nA typical plot of the machine data from one of the linear friction welds is shown in Fig. 3.\nThis particular weld used a frequency of 30 Hz and a peak rubbing velocity of 549 mm s-1.\nThe burn-off (Fig. 3(a)), which indicates the displacement of the tooling, starts from a negative\nvalue initially. Once the two samples touch (at about 1.0 second) the value remains relatively\nconstant before increasing toward the final value of 3.5 mm near the end of the weld. From\nthis curve five phases of the LFW are identified: phase 0 before the samples touch and the\nmachine is free-running; phase I the initial or conditioning phase; phase II the transition phase;\nphase III the equilibrium phase; and phase IV the forge phase. About 1.7 seconds is required\nto make this particular weld and about one second has elapsed during the free-running phase.\nThe axial load which is measured by the load cell and pressure transducer (Fig. 3(a)), increase\nto 101 kN after a short period of oscillation. The plot of the in-plane force (Fig. 3(b)) shows a\nrapid increase after the samples touch and then remains relatively constant thereafter. The\ninitial increase corresponds to the increase in axial load. This contrasts with Vairis and Frost1\nwho observed an increase in the in-plane force around the start of phase II. Possible reasons\nfor the difference in the two results are:\n\uf0b7 Vairis and Frost welded titanium whereas the current work uses steel.\n\uf0b7 Much higher rubbing velocities and friction pressures are used in the current work\nwhich will lead to a greater power input.\nIn addition, the machine used by Vairis and Frost started oscillation with the samples touching\nso there was no phase 0. Finally, while the welds in Vairis and Frost took between 8 and 60\nseconds, the welds in the current study took a maximum of 2.2 seconds.\n3.3 Calculating Acceleration\nThe velocity and acceleration data calculated by the numerical techniques described in section\n2.2, are shown in Fig. 4. Note that the acceleration estimate based on the displacement, x\n(Equation (10)) uses the actual displacement rather than an idealised one based on the sin\nfunction. There is considerable noise in the estimate of acceleration which uses numerical\ndifferentiation (Equation (9)) which is absent from the estimate based on the displacement\n(Equation (10)). For high frequency oscillations, the time spent for one cycle is reduced and as the\nsampling rate is kept constant at 1 ms, the resolution of the cycle in terms of measuring points will\nbe coarsened accordingly. Nevertheless, the estimate based on the displacement (Equation (10))\nis considered sufficiently accurate to be used for estimates of the energy input.\n3.4 Relationship between in-plane force and interface force\nPlots of the interface and in-plane force for two different welding conditions are shown in Fig.\n5. See Fig. 1(b) for the sign conventions for the forces. The velocity has been inverted for\nclarity. To aid understanding of these plots three phases of the cycle are identified: phase a,\nthe acceleration phase; phase b, constant velocity phase; and phase c, the deceleration phase.\nThese phases are shown pictorially in Fig. 6. During the acceleration phase, a the interface\nforce is generally lower than the in-plane force. This is because the force at the interface and\nthe momentum of the tooling are additive (see equation (6)). In the constant velocity phase, b\nthe interface and in-plane forces are approximately equal because the acceleration is\napproximately zero. During the deceleration phase, c the momentum subtracts from the force\n7at the interface so the interface force is higher than the in-plane force measured at the load cell.\nThe difference is greatest where the velocity is near zero (i.e. at the ends of the stroke) because\nthis is the point where the acceleration is greatest. Since the magnitude of the acceleration\ncalculated from the displacement is proportional to the displacement multiplied by the square\nof the angular frequency (Equation (10)), higher oscillation frequencies increase the difference\nbetween the interface and in-plane forces.\nOne of the issues with the analysis is the accuracy of the estimate of acceleration. One way of\nvalidating the estimate of the acceleration is to examine the direction of the interface force.\nThe interface force must oppose the direction of motion. i.e. friction always operates opposite\nto the direction of travel. The two force traces indicate that this is not always the case,\nparticularly for the lower speed plot in Fig. 5(a). The error may be due to an error in either the\nload cell or displacement readings. e.g. there could be a slight delay in the readings obtained\nfrom the load cell. Another potential source of error is deflection of the samples, and finally it\nmay also be caused by the method used to estimate the acceleration.\nThe interface force is approximately proportional to the velocity, particularly for the lower\nspeed plot in Fig. 5(a). If the interface force were purely columbic then the interface force\nwould be entirely dependent on the friction at the interface and the load applied. This is clearly\nnot the case and it is suggested that one or more of the following factors may cause the\nvariation in force observed:\n\uf0b7 Rubbing velocity. Under high temperatures and pressures a sticking condition often\nexists between the two rubbing surfaces14,15. Therefore the rubbing causes shearing of\nthe material and the flow-stress is dependant on the strain-rate of the material. Hence\nhigher velocities increase the strain-rate leading to a greater flow stress which requires\na higher interfacial force to cause the deformation.\n\uf0b7 Interfacial area. The interfacial area between the two parts varies linearly with the\ndisplacement. Hence the maximum area is obtained when the two parts are aligned and\nis minimum at the maximum amplitude or displacement. This effect will lead to higher\nvalues of the interface force when the parts are aligned.\n\uf0b7 Ploughing effects. This effect is explained in the diagrams shown in Fig. 7. This\ncharacteristic is observed in both force traces, but particularly Fig. 5(b). This\nploughing effect would also explain why the flash is produced in pulses rather than\nbeing a continuous flow which has been observed by several authors1,2,8. It may also\nhelp to explain the ripple in the burn-off curve observed in Fig. 3(a).\nFinally it was interesting to note that the peak interface force was approximately 100 kN\nirrespective of the welding condition. This suggests that the rubbing velocity and the\nassociated strain-rate effects may not significantly affect the force at the interface, with\ninterfacial area and ploughing having the dominant effect.\n3.5 Energy efficiency\nTo analyse the energy input to the weld a series of six plots have been produced which are\nshown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) shows a plot of the interface and in-plane energies for phases 1, 2\nand 3 (the free running phase 0 is excluded). The interface energy exceeds the in-plane energy\nfor the low rubbing velocity welds which is obviously an error in the calculation and is likely\nto be due to the errors in calculating the interface force which are described above. In any\ncase, the magnitude of the error is small and it is possible to conclude that for low rubbing\n8velocity conditions the losses caused by oscillating the tooling and sample are negligible.\nHowever this is not the case for the high rubbing velocity welds where the energy efficiency\nduring the welding phase can be reduced to approximately 85%.\nDespite this lower efficiency at the higher frequencies the overall energy input to the weld was\nmuch lower. The main cause of this was the much shorter weld duration needed when using\nhigh rubbing velocities (Fig. 8(b)). The shorter welding time is achieved because the power\ninput (Fig. 8(c)) is greater at the high rubbing velocities.\nThe plot of the overall energy consumption Fig. 8(d) which includes the energy consumed in\nphase 0 indicated very little difference over the range of parameters examined, although a\nrubbing velocity of 710 mm s-1 minimised the energy consumption for these particular welds.\nThe energy consumed during phase 0 for the high rubbing velocity welds is considerably\nhigher (13 kJ compared to 1.5 kJ) due to the energy required to oscillate the tooling at this\nspeed. Reducing energy consumption during the free running phase by shortening its duration\nis one way to significantly reduce the overall energy consumption for the high rubbing velocity\nwelds. If this were done the total energy consumption for these welds would be significantly\nlower than the other welding conditions. Note that the free running time in this research\nprogramme was random and this factor would be accurately controlled in a production\nscenario. The high energy losses to oscillate the tooling at high rubbing velocities are reflected\nin the overall efficiency Fig. 8(e), which includes the energy input during the free running\nphase 0 (unlike Fig. 8(a)).\nThe total weld or rubbing distance Fig. 8(f) shows little variation across the range of\nparameters examined. This suggests that there is a very strong relationship between the\nrubbing distance and the burn-off. The slightly lower values obtained for the high rubbing\nvelocity welds are likely to be due to the higher power input for these welds which reduces the\ntime taken to make the weld.\n4 Conclusions\nThe main conclusions from this work are:\n\uf0b7 Five phases were identified during the LFW process. The in-plane force had a slightly\ndifferent characteristic to that observed by Vairis and Frost1. The difference may be\ndue to the different parameters used in this work as well as the different materials used.\n\uf0b7 A method for calculating the force at the weld interface from the forces measured at a\nload cell attached to the tooling has been demonstrated. This enabled calculation of the\nenergy input to make the weld under different combinations of frequency and rubbing\nvelocity.\n\uf0b7 The energy input required to make a weld can be minimised by optimising the rubbing\nvelocity.\n\uf0b7 High frequency LFW is inherently less efficient, but welds can be made more quickly\nso overall energy usage may be reduced.\n\uf0b7 Examining plots of the interface force and rubbing velocity versus time for different\nwelding parameters proved particularly interesting. This showed that the peak in the\nforce occurs just prior to the centre position and is likely to be caused by ploughing\neffects.\n95 Acknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) of Nigeria\nand TWI for helping to fund this work.\n6 References\n1.
