We have\nidentified 60 new candidate members with masses in the range 1.007 < M < 0.269 M\u0001. For\neach we have estimated a membership probability by extracting control clusters from the proper\nmotion vector diagram. All 60 are found to have greater than 60 per cent probability of being\nmembers, more than doubling the number of known cluster members. The new luminosity\nfunction for the cluster peaks at bright magnitudes, but is rising at K \u2248 12, indicating that it is\nlikely that lower mass members may exist. The mass function also supports this hypothesis.\nKey words: open clusters and associations: individual: Coma Berenices \u2013 open clusters and\nassociations: individual: Melotte 111.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nDuring the last two decades there have been numerous deep surveys\nof young nearby open clusters focusing on the detection of very\nlow-mass stellar and substellar members (e.g. Jameson & Skillen\n1989; Lodieu et al. 2005). Since these objects fade during their evo-\nlution, in these environments they are comparatively luminous, plac-\ning them comfortably within the reach of 2\/4-m-class telescopes.\nFurthermore, numerical simulations suggest that in clusters with\nages less than \u223c200 Myr, dynamical evolution should not yet have\nled to the evaporation of a large proportion of these members (e.g.\nde la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2000).\nFor these same reasons, there have been relatively few searchs of\nthis type undertaken in older open clusters. Indeed, the few deep,\nlarge-area surveys of the Hyades, the most extensively studied clus-\nter of its type and the closest to the Sun (46.3 pc: Perryman et al.\n1998), have led to the identification of only a very small number\nof low-mass stellar and substellar members (e.g. Reid 1993; Gizis,\nReid & Monet 1999; Moraux, private communication). This finding\nis loosely in agreement with the predictions of N-body simulations\nwhich indicate that less than one-fifth of the original population of\nsubstellar members remains tidally bound to a cluster at the age of\nthe Hyades, 625 \u00b1 50 Myr (Perryman et al. 1998). However, de-\nspite this rough consistency, until the very low-mass populations of\nmore open clusters of similar age to the Hyades have been studied,\nit seems premature to exclude completely other interpretations for\nthe deficit of low-mass members here, e.g. differences in the initial\nmass function. Furthermore, additional investigations of this nature\nmay also be of use in refining N-body simulations.\nTherefore we have recently embarked on a survey of the Coma\nBerenices open star cluster (Melotte 111, RA = 12h23m00s,\n\u0001E-mail: slc25@star.le.ac.uk\nDec. = +26\u25e600\u203200\u2032\u2032, J2000.0) to extend our knowledge of its lumi-\nnosity function towards the hydrogen-burning limit. At first glance\nthis seems a prudent choice of target. It is the second closest open\ncluster to the Sun. Hipparcos measurements place it at d = 89.9 \u00b1\n2.1 pc (van Leeuwen 1999), in agreement with older ground-based\nestimates (e.g. d = 85.4 \u00b1 4.9 pc: Nicolet 1981). Furthermore, fore-\nground extinction along this line of sight is low, E(B \u2212 V )\u22480.006\u00b1\n0.013 (Nicolet 1981). The metallicity of the cluster is relatively well\nconstrained. Spectroscopic examination of cluster members reveals\nit to be slightly metal-poor with respect to the Sun. For example,\nCayrel de Strobel (1990) determines [Fe\/H] = \u22120.065 \u00b1 0.021 us-\ning a sample of eight F-, G- and K-type associates, whereas Friel &\nBoesgaard (1992) determine [Fe\/H] = \u22120.052 \u00b1 0.047 from 14 F\nand G dwarf members. While estimates of the age of Melotte 111\nvary considerably from 300 Myr to 1 Gyr (e.g. Tsvetkov 1989),\nmore recent determinations, based on fitting model isochrones to\nthe observed cluster sequence, are bunched around 400\u2013500 Myr\n(e.g. Bounatiro & Arimoto 1993; Odenkirchen, Soubiran & Colin\n1998). Thus the Coma Berenices open cluster is probably marginally\nyounger than the Hyades.\nHowever, Melotte 111 is projected over a large area of sky\n(\u223c100 deg2) and contains considerably fewer bright stellar members\nthan the Hyades. For example, Odenkirchen et al. (1998) determines\nthe cluster tidal radius to be \u223c5\u20136 pc but finds only 34 kinematic\nmembers down to V = 10.5 within a circular area of radius 5\u25e6 cen-\ntred on the cluster. He estimates the total mass of Melotte 111 to\nlie in the range 30\u201390 M\u0001, which can be compared with estimates\nof 300\u2013460 M\u0001 for the mass of the Hyades (e.g. Oort 1979; Reid\n1992). Additionally, the small proper motion (\u00b5\u03b1 = \u221211.21 \u00b1 0.26\nmas yr\u22121, \u00b5\u03b4 = \u22129.16 \u00b1 0.15 mas yr\u22121: van Leeuwen 1999) means\nthat proper motion alone is not a suitable means by which to dis-\ncriminate the members of Melotte 111 from the general field popu-\nlation. Fortunately, the convergent point for the cluster is sufficiently\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

Dobbie\ndistant at RA = 6h40h31.s2, Dec = \u221241\u25e633\u203200\u2032\u2032 (J2000) (Madsen,\nDravins & Lindgren 2002) that we can expect all the cluster mem-\nbers to have essentially the same proper motion.\nIn the first detailed survey of Melotte 111, Trumpler (1938) used\nproper motion, spectrophotometric and radial velocity measure-\nments to identify 37 probable members, photometric magnitude\nmP < 10.5, in a circular region of 7\u25e6 diameter centred on the cluster.\nA significant additional number of fainter candidate members were\nidentified by Artyukhina (1955) from a deep (mP < 15) proper mo-\ntion survey of \u223c7 deg2 of the cluster. Argue & Kenworthy (1969)\nperformed a photographic UBVI survey of a circular field, 3.\u25e63 in\ndiameter, to a limiting depth of mP = 15.5. They rejected all but two\nof Artyukhina\u2019s candidates with mP > 11 but identified a further\ntwo faint objects with photometry and proper motion which they\ndeemed to be consistent with cluster membership. Subsequently,\nDeluca & Weis (1981) obtained photoelectric photometry for 88\nobjects (V > 11), drawn from these two studies. They concluded\nthat only four stars, three of which were listed by Argue & Kenwor-\nthy as probable members, had photometry and astrometry consistent\nwith association with Melotte 111.\nMore recently, Bounatiro & Arimoto (1993) have searched an\narea of 6\u25e6 \u00d7 6\u25e6 centred on Melotte 111, using the Astronomische\nGesellschaft Katalog 3 (AGK3) catalogue, and have identified 17\nnew candidate members (m P < 12). However, despite Randich,\nSchmitt & Prosser (1996) identifying 12 new potential low-mass\nmembers (V \u2248 11.5\u201316) from a ROSAT Position Sensitive Propor-\ntional Counter (PSPC) survey of the cluster, a detailed follow-up\nstudy has concluded that none of these is an associate of Melotte\n111 (Garcia-Lopez et al. 2000). Odenkirchen et al. (1998) have used\nthe Hipparcos and ACT reference catalogues to perform a compre-\nhensive kinematic and photometric study of 1200 deg2 around the\ncluster centre complete to a depth of V \u2248 10.5. They find a to-\ntal of \u223c50 kinematic associates which appear to be distributed in\na core\u2013halo system. The core, which is elliptical in shape with a\nsemi-major axis of 1.\u25e66, is dominated by the more massive members,\nwhile the halo contains proportionately more low-mass associates.\nOdenkirchen, Soubiran & Colin also find evidence of an extra-tidal\n\u2018moving group\u2019 located in front of the cluster in the context of its\nmotion around the Galaxy. However, from a subsequent spectro-\nscopic study, Ford et al. (2001) conclude that approximately half of\nthe moving group were not associated with the cluster.\nThe ready availability of high-quality astrometric and photomet-\nric survey catalogues [e.g. USNO-B1.0 (United States Naval Ob-\nservatory), the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS)] have made\na new deeper, wide-area survey of the Coma Berenices open star\ncluster a tractable undertaking. In this paper we report on our ef-\nforts to use the USNO-B1.0 and 2MASS Point Source catalogues to\nsearch for further candidate low-mass members of Melotte 111. We\nidentify 60 new candidates with proper motions and photometry\nconsistent with cluster membership. State-of-the-art evolutionary\nmodels indicate that some of these objects have masses of only\nM \u2248 0.269 M\u0001.\n2 T H E P R E S E N T S U RV E Y\nIn ideal cases, membership of nearby open clusters can be ascer-\ntained by either photometry or proper motion. In the former ap-\nproach, associates of a cluster are generally identified by insisting\nthat they have magnitudes and colours that, within uncertainties, sit\nthem on or close to an appropriate model isochrone (e.g. Bouvier\net al. 1998). In the latter approach, as measurement errors usually\ndominate over the cluster velocity dispersion, selection of mem-\nbers simply requires that objects have astrometric motions consis-\ntent with known associates of a cluster. When combined, these two\nmethods can yield candidates with a very high probability of cluster\nmembership (e.g. Moraux, Bouvier & Stauffer 2001).\nHowever, as discussed in Section 1, the proper motion of Melotte\n111 is comparatively small and not suitable alone for the discrim-\nination of cluster members. For example, members of the Pleiades\nopen cluster, which can be readily identified astrometrically, have\nproper motions of \u00b5\u03b1 = 19.14 \u00b1 0.25 mas yr\u22121, \u00b5\u03b4 = \u221245.25\n\u00b10.19 mas yr\u22121 (van Leeuwen 1999). Nevertheless, because of the\nlarge epoch difference of approximately 50 yr between the two Palo-\nmar Sky Surveys, if we restrict the search to R < 18.0, the proper\nmotion measurements available in the USNO-B1.0 catalogue are\nsufficiently accurate that they can be used in conjunction with suit-\nable photometry to identify candidates with a substantial probabil-\nity of being members of Melotte 111. In principle the USNO-B1.0\ncatalogue provides B, R and I photometry, but the significant uncer-\ntainties in the photographic magnitudes (\u223c0.3 mag) severely limit\nits usefulness for this work (Monet et al. 2003). Therefore, to com-\nplement the astrometry, we choose to use J, H and KS photometry\nfrom the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue which has signal-to-noise\nratio \u000110 down to J = 15.8, H = 15.1 and K S = 14.3 (Skrutskie\net al. 1997).\nThe survey was conducted as follows.\n(i) A circular area of radius 4\u25e6 centred on the cluster was extracted\nfrom the USNO-B1.0 catalogue.\n(ii) Stars were selected according to the criterion (\u00b5\u03b1 \u2212 X )2 +\n(\u00b5\u03b4 \u2212 Y )2 < 100, where X = \u221211.21 and Y = \u22129.16, i.e. to lie\nwithin 10 mas yr\u22121 of the Hipparcos-determined value for the proper\nmotion of Melotte 111. This procedure was initially repeated for\nX = \u221211.21, Y = +9.16 and X = +11.21, Y = \u22129.16, to ob-\ntain two control samples (see Fig. 1). Two more control samples\nwere later extracted from two further circular regions of USNO-\nB1.0 data. These data had a similar Galactic latitude to the cluster\nbut were offset by 10\u25e6 from the centre of Melotte 111. Stars were\nselected from these latter regions by applying the first proper motion\ncriterion above. The known members have errors, or velocity disper-\nsions amounting to about \u00b12.0 km s\u22121 (Odenkirchen et al. 1998).\nThis corresponds to a proper motion of \u00b14.8 mas yr\u22121, and the\nUSNO-B1.0 catalogue astrometry errors (see Tables 1 and 2) are\nsmall \u2013 typically less than \u00b15 mas yr\u22121 for our stars. Note that\nFigure 1. Plot of the USNO CCD Astronomy Catalog (UCAC; Zacharias\net al. 2004) proper motions for 4 deg2 of the cluster centre. The thin line\nborders the cluster proper motion selection, and the thick line borders the\ncontrols.The shallower UCAC catalogue is used here for illustration as the\nUSNO-B1.0 catalogue only provides quantized values of 2 mas yr\u22121.\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

Thus if we select a bounding circle of 10 mas yr\u22121,\nand the total quadratically added error is 7 mas yr\u22121, we have se-\nlected all stars to a completeness level of 1.4\u03c3 , which means that\nour survey is complete to \u224890 per cent.\n(iii) Stars passing the above sets of criteria were cross-referenced\nagainst the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue using a match radius of\n2 arcsec.\n(iv) Subsequently the sample of candidate cluster members and\nthe four control samples were plotted in J \u2212 K S, K S colour\u2013\nmagnitude diagrams (CMDs) as illustrated in Fig. 2 (top and bottom\npanels respectively).\nA cursory glance at the CMDs in Fig. 2 reveals that our method\nappears to be rather successful in finding new associates of Melotte\n111. An obvious cluster sequence can be seen extending to K \u2248\n12, beyond which it is overwhelmed by field star contamination. To\nperform a quantitative selection of candidate members we restrict\nourselves to K S < 12. We use as a guide to the location of the\ncluster sequence the previously known members and a 400-Myr\nNEXTGEN isochrone for solar metallicity (Baraffe et al. 1998),\nscaled to the Hipparcos distance determination for Melotte 111.

The CMD for the cluster (top) and a control sample with \u00b5\u03b1 =\n+11.21, \u00b5\u03b4 = \u22129.16 (bottom). Previously known members of the cluster\nare highlighted in the upper plot (solid squares). A 0.4-Gyr NEXTGEN\nisochrone is overplotted from Baraffe et al. (1998) (solid line). This was\nconverted into the 2MASS system using the transforms of Carpenter (2001).\nthe magnitude range where they overlap, the previously known clus-\nter members of the single star sequence congregate around the the-\noretical isochrone (all previously known cluster members are listed\nin Table 1). Furthermore, the model isochrone appears to continue\nto follow closely the excess of objects in the top panel of Fig. 2,\nrelative to the bottom panel, suggesting that it is relatively robust in\nthis effective temperature regime.\nThe location of the theoretical isochrone at J \u2212 K S < 0.8 is\ninsensitive to the uncertainties in the age of the cluster. The cluster\nwould have to be much younger to shift the isochrone significantly.\nThe bulk of the observed dispersion in the single star sequence here\nprobably stems from the finite depth of the cluster (\u223c0.15 mag).\nNevertheless, in this colour range we choose to select objects that\nlie no more than 0.3 mag below the theoretical isochrone, as this\nensures that all previously known cluster members are recovered\n(filled squares in Fig. 2, top panel). As binary members can lie up to\n0.75 mag above the single star sequence, only objects that also lie\nno more than 1.05 mag above the theoretical sequence are deemed\ncandidate members.\nRedward of J \u2212 K S = 0.8, the main sequence becomes very\nsteep in this CMD. We have tried using various combinations of\n2MASS and USNO-B1.0 photometry (e.g. colours such as R \u2212 K )\nto circumvent this. However, as mentioned previously, the poorer\nquality of the photographic magnitudes provided by the USNO-B1.0\ncatalogue results in a large amount of scatter in optical + infrared\nCMDs, rendering them of little use for this work. None the less,\nthe finite depth of the cluster and a small error in cluster distance\ndetermination have a negligible effect in this part of the J \u2212 K S, K S\nCMD. Based on previous experience gained from our investigations\nof the low-mass members of the Pleiades and Praesepe open clusters,\nwe estimate an uncertainty in the model J \u2212 K colour of \u00b10.05 mag.\nHence for J \u2212 K S > 0.8 we have selected all objects that overlap a\nregion 0.1 mag wide in J \u2212 K , centred on the theoretical isochrone.\nTo assess levels of contamination in our list of candidate members,\nwe have imposed these same colour selection criteria on the control\nsamples. The resulting sequences were divided into 1-mag bins (in\nKS) for J \u2212 K S > 0.8, and in bins of 0.2 in J \u2212 K S for J \u2212 K S < 0.8,\nand the number of objects in each for both the cluster and control\nsamples counted. Subsequently, the membership probablility for\neach candidate cluster member, Pmembership, was estimated using\nPmembership = Ncluster \u2212 NcontrolNcluster , (1)\nwhere N cluster is the number of stars in a magnitude bin from the\ncluster sample and N control is the mean number of stars in the same\nmagnitude range but drawn from the control samples. Our list of\ncandidate associates of Melotte 111 is presented in Table 2, along\nwith these estimates of membership probability.\nWe note that there is a slight increase in the level of contamination\nin the range 0.55 < J \u2212 K S < 0.7. A similar increase in the number\nof field stars was seen by Adams et al. (2002) when studying the\nPraesepe open cluster, which, like Melotte 111, has a relatively high\nGalactic latitude, b = 38\u25e6. We believe that this is due to K giants\nlocated in the thick disc.\n3 R E S U LT S\nOur survey of the Coma Berenices open cluster has recovered\n45 previously known members in total, 38 listed by Bounatiro &\nArimoto (1993) and seven unearthed by Odenkirchen et al. (1998).\nFurthermore, it has identified 60 new candidate cluster members\nwith magnitudes down to K S = 12. Beyond this magnitude, no sta-\ntistically significant difference between the cluster and the control\nsamples was found, as the contamination by field stars is too great.\nWe believe that our survey is reasonably complete to this limit; we\ntried proper motion search radii of 7 and 5 mas yr\u22121, but in both cases\nfound that increasing numbers of likely members were excluded. Ex-\npanding the search radius to greater than 10 mas yr\u22121 unearthed no\nstatistically significant increase in the number of candidate mem-\nbers, as the candidates and control stars increased proportionally,\nleading to many candidates with extremely small probabilities of\nbeing cluster members.

As the stars get fainter, however, the\nerrors in their proper motion do increase \u2013 which is to be expected.\nIt is entirely possible that the completeness is less than 90 per cent\nfor the faint stars.\nWe have estimated the masses of our candidates and the pre-\nviously known cluster members using the evolutionary tracks of\nGirardi et al. (2002) for masses \u00021 M\u0001, and the NEXTGEN mod-\nels of Baraffe et al. (1998) for M < 1 M\u0001. The stars were binned\naccording to K magnitude or J \u2212 K colour, for the vertical and di-\nagonal portions of the main sequence. We then linearly interpolated\nbetween the model masses to estimate the masses of the cluster stars\nand our candidates. These masses are shown in the final columns of\nTables 1 and 2, and illustrated in Fig. 5 (later). By multiplying the\nestimated masses of the stars by their membership probabilities (we\nassume P membership = 1.0 for previously known members) and sum-\nming, we determine a total cluster mass of \u223c102 M\u0001. This in turn\nallows us to derive a tidal radius of 6.5 pc or 4.\u25e61 at 90 pc. Thus we\nfind that within our adopted survey radius of 4\u25e6 we should expect to\nfind 99 per cent of the gravitationally bound proper motion selected\ncluster members. Indeed, increasing the search radius to 5\u25e6 led to a\nnear-equal increase in both candidate cluster members and stars in\nthe control.\nFig. 3 shows the H \u2212 K , J \u2212 H two-colour diagram for all new\ncandidate and previously known cluster members. The colours of\nour candidates show a clear turnover at H \u2212 K \u2248 0.15, consistent\nwith them being dwarfs and supporting our conclusion that these are\nlow-mass members of Melotte 111. Therefore we have constructed\na KS luminosity function and mass function for the cluster (Figs 4\nand 5). The luminosity function is seen to peak at K S = 7.5, M KS=\n2.7 and to decline gradually towards fainter magnitudes. Super-\nimposed on this decline is the Wielen dip (Wielen 1971) at\nK S = 10.5.\nThe peaking of the luminosity function at this comparatively\nbright magnitude strongly suggests that a large proportion of the\nFigure 3.

The colour trans-\nformations of Carpenter (2001) were used to convert the model colours.\nFigure 4. Luminosity function for the cluster, taking into account proba-\nbility of membership.

The error bars indicate the Poisson error.\nlower mass members, which are normally more numerous than the\nhigher mass members (e.g. Hambly, Hawkins & Jameson 1991),\nhave evaporated from the cluster. This should not come as a great\nsurprise, since at ages \u03c4 \u0001 200 Myr dynamical evolution of a typ-\nical open cluster is expected to lead to the loss of a significant and\nincreasing fraction of the lowest mass members (e.g. de la Fuente\nMarcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2000). The mass function also sup-\nports this conclusion. Thus, despite having found low-mass stars in\nthe cluster, our study does not contradict the conclusion of previous\nauthors that the cluster is deficient in low-mass stars. Odenkirchen\net al. (1998) found that the luminosity function of extra-tidal stars\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

This can be\nconsidered to be indicative of the ongoing loss of low-mass mem-\nbers. Ford et al. (2001), however, determined that approximately\nhalf of these stars did not belong to the cluster. A more in-depth\nstudy of lower mass members would be required to determine a\nmore accurate luminosity function at fainter magnitudes.\nOur faintest candidate member has an estimated mass of\n0.269 M\u0001. There are some 18 stars in the magnitude range K S =\n11\u201312, the lowest luminosity bin, thus it seems a distinct possibil-\nity that the Coma Berenices open cluster will have members right\ndown to the limit of the hydrogen-burning main sequence and possi-\nbly into the brown dwarf regime. This conclusion is also confirmed\nby the rising mass function at lower masses.\n4 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe have performed a deep, wide-area survey of the Coma Berenices\nopen star cluster, using the USNO-B1.0 and the 2MASS Point\nSource catalogues, to search for new candidate low-mass mem-\nbers. This has led to the identification of 60 objects with probabili-\nties of cluster membership P membership \u0001 0.6. Our lowest mass new\ncandidate member has M \u2248 0.269 M\u0001, in contrast to the previ-\nously known lowest mass member, M \u2248 0.915 M\u0001. Thus we have\nextended considerably the cluster luminosity function towards the\nbottom of the main sequence. As reported by previous investiga-\ntions of Melotte 111, the luminosity function is observed to decline\ntowards fainter magnitudes, indicating that the cluster has probably\nlost and continues to lose its lowest mass members. This is not sur-\nprising for a cluster with an age of 400\u2013500 Myr. Nevertheless, as\nthe cluster luminosity function remains well above zero at K S =\n12, we believe that the cluster probably has members down to the\nbottom of the hydrogen-burning main sequence and possibly some\nbrown dwarfs. Thus a deeper IZ magnitude survey of the cluster\ncould prove a fruitful undertaking.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThis research has made use of the USNOFS Image and Catalogue\nArchive operated by the United States Naval Observatory, Flagstaff\nStation (http:\/\/www.nofs.navy.mil\/data\/fchpix\/).
