Molecule 16 possesses multifunctionality and is of interest for \nfuture molecular electronic device applications.  \nIntroduction \nOrganic molecules with extended \u03c0\u2212conjugated systems are of considerable current \ninterest in molecular electronics due to their potential applications in electrical circuits, \nswitches, light-emitting devices and sensors.[1] The synthesis of nanometer-length conjugated \norganic molecules which are suitably functionalized for assembly onto metal or \nsemiconductor surfaces is a considerable challenge.[2] Various molecular wires of this type \nhave been connected into hybrid organic\/semiconductor architectures,[3] usually via terminal \nthiol-gold contacts,[4] although amines[5] can also effectively bond to gold. \nFor future practical applications the interfacing organic molecular wires with silicon[6] \nis an attractive alternative to assembly onto gold surfaces. The high thermodynamic and \nkinetic stability of the C-Si bond leads to a robust anchor point. Moreover, the potential \nproblem of metal nanofilament formation[7] is removed thereby ensuring that molecular \neffects are measured. This research is in its very early stages and initial steps are being \nreported. For example, Tour et al. have exploited direct Si-arylcarbon bonding to short \n  \n \n3\nphenyleneethynylene oligomers (3 aryl rings) in the construction of a metal-free silicon\u2013\nmolecule\u2013carbon nanotube architecture.[8] Direct linkage of a para-substituted benzene \nderivative to Si, again through a Si-arylcarbon bond, was a key step in assembling a \nmultilayer nanoparticle film in a silicon nanogap device.[9] \nSilicon nanogaps of 7-8 nm dimensions can be readily obtained by conventional \nlithographic and CMOS techniques which are amenable to mass production.[10]  It is, \ntherefore, timely to develop synthetic routes to organic molecular wires which are suitably \nfunctionalized at the termini to bridge a 7-8 nm gap. Terminal alkynes are attractive as there \nare precedents for their assembly onto hydride-terminated silicon surfaces by covalent Si\u2013\nC\u2261C\u2013 bonding.[11] Linear aryleneethynylene oligomers, (aryl\u2013C\u2261C\u2013)n, are well-suited for the \nwire component as they have conjugated rigid-rod structures[12] whose molecular lengths are \nwell-defined, although the barrier to rotation about the aryl\u2013ethynyl bond is low (typically < \n1 kcal mol\u22121).[13] \nAs the length of \u03c0\u2212systems increase, synthetic endeavors often encounter problems \nwith purification, chemical instability and poor solubility. The main aim of the present work \nwas to establish an efficient route to alkyne-terminated aryleneethynylene derivatives of up \nto ca. 8 nm in length. To this end, molecule 16 has successfully been obtained and fully \ncharacterized. The 9,9-dialkylfluorene units in the backbone ensure good processability in \norganic solvents. To demonstrate that our methodology is compatible with more elaborate \nfunctional groups, electron-deficient bis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl) substituents were \nappended to the central fluorene unit of 16. Such functionalization is relevant as a visionary \nfuture application of integrated Si\/molecule\/Si devices is in the field of sensor technology[14] \nwhere pendant units could act as molecular recognition sites. \nResults and Discussion \n  \n \n4\nThe symmetrical target molecule 16 was obtained via a convergent strategy using iterative \npalladium-mediated Sonogashira cross-coupling methodology. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis \nof 4 which was used as the reagent for the central unit of 16. The reaction of \npentafluorophenol 1 with 1,3-dibromopropane under basic conditions gave 2 in 50% yield. \n2,7-Diiodofluorene 3 was then dialkylated at C9 using 2 under basic conditions to afford 4 in \n85% yield. The X-ray molecular structure of 4 is shown in Figure 1. \n \nOH\nFF\nF\nF F\nO\nFF\nF\nF F\nBr\nOO\nF\nF\nF\nF\nFF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nI I\n1 2  (50% yield)\n4 (85% yield)\nI I\n3\n1,3-dibromopropane, \nK2CO3, MeCN, reflux\n3, NaOH, H2O, \nTHF, reflux\n \nScheme 1. Synthesis of the core reagent 4. \n \nAnother key building block 6 was obtained in 77% yield by reaction of 5[15] with 3-\nhydroxyl-3-methylbutyne under standard Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions[16] \n[piperidine, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and CuI in THF]. The disubstituted derivative 7 was also obtained \nas a minor byproduct (19% yield) in this reaction (Scheme 2).  The polar 2-hydroxy-2-propyl \nprotecting group(s) facilitated the clean chromatographic purification of the product mixture.  \n \n  \n \n5\nC6H13 C6H13\nI I\n5\nC6H13C6H13\nI\n6 (77% yield)\nHO\nMe\nMe\nC6H13C6H13\n7 (19% yield)\nHO\nMe\nMe\nOH\nMe\nMe\npiperidine, THF, \nPd[PPh3]2Cl2, CuI, 20 oC\nHO\nMe\nMe\n \nScheme 2. Synthesis of the key reagent 6. \n \nTo assemble the terminal biaryl segment of the wire, compound 8[17] was converted into 9 \nby reaction with trimethylsilylacetylene [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, CuI, triethylamine] in 95% yield. \nThroughout Scheme 3 our strategy used the regioselective removal of a 2-hydroxy-2-propyl \nprotecting group from terminal alkynes in the presence of a trimethylsilyl group[18] at the \nother terminus of the growing chain. Refluxing 9 in toluene in the presence of sodium \nhydroxide[19] gave 10 in 97% yield. The subsequent reactions to linearly extend the \naryleneethynylene system were iterative cross-coupling\/deprotection procedures. Thus, \nreaction of 10 with 6 gave 11 in 73% yield, followed by deprotection of 11 to give 12 (91% \nyield). The X-ray molecular structure of 11 is described below. By direct analogy, \ncompounds 13 and 14 were obtained in 46 and 60% yields, respectively. The butadiyne \nderivative 17 (Chart 1) was obtained in 24% yield from oxidative self-coupling of 12, \nalongside formation of the cross-coupled product 13. The hexyl chains ensured good \nsolubility and straightforward purification of the building blocks 11-14 and 17. \nIn the crucial convergent step, two-fold Sonogashira reaction of 14 with reagent 4 yielded \n15 (39% yield) along with the self-coupled butadiyne derivative 18 (8% yield). Deprotection \nof the terminal TMS groups of 15 with K2CO3 in THF\/methanol gave the target wire 16 as a \nyellow solid in 90% yield. Evidence for extended \u03c0\u2212conjugation through the backbone of 16 \nwas provided by the UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra in chloroform solution (see \nthe Supporting Information; Figure S4) and DFT calculations (see below). In particular the \n  \n \n6\nstrong blue fluorescence at \u03bbmax 420, 443 nm is consistent with a highly conjugated \naryleneethynylene structure.[15] \nIHO\nMe\nMe\nHO\nMe\nMe\nSiMe3\nSiMe3SiMe3\nC6H13C6H13\nHO\nMe\nMe\n8 9 (95% yield)\n10 (97% yield)11 (73% yield)\nSiMe3\nC6H13C6H13 12 (91% yield)\nSiMe3\nC6H13C6H13\n13 (46% yield)\nC6H13C6H13\nHO\nMe\nMe\n14 (60% yield)\n15  R = TMS\n(39% yield)\n16  R = H (90% yield)\nSiMe3\nC6H13C6H13\nC6H13C6H13\nOO\nF\nF\nF\nF\nFF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nRR\nC6H13 C6H13\nC6H13 C6H13\nC6H13 C6H13\nC6H13 C6H13\nNEt3, THF, Pd[PPh3]2Cl2, \nCuI, 20 oC\nSiMe3\nNaOH, toluene, reflux\n6, NEt3, THF, Pd[PPh3]2Cl2, \nCuI, 20 oC\n6, NEt3, THF, \nPd[PPh3]2Cl2, CuI, 20 oC\n4 (0.5 equiv.), NEt3, THF, \nPd[PPh3]2Cl2, CuI, 50 oC\nK2CO3, THF, \nMeOH, 20 oC\nNaOH, toluene, reflux\nNaOH, toluene, reflux\n \nScheme 3.

Self-coupled symmetrical butadiyne derivatives. \nThe asymmetric unit of 4 comprises two molecules (Figure 1). The crystal packing is highly \nunusual and is worthy of note. There are segregated stacks of fluorene and pentafluorophenyl \nmoieties, whereas the common motif of such systems is a mixed stack of alternating arene and \nperfluoroarene moieties or molecules.[20]  \n \nFigure 1.

For further discussion see the \nSupporting Information. \n \nFigure 2. Molecule of 11 in the crystal. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability \nlevel. Only the major conformations of the disordered n-hexyl chains are shown.  \n \nTo probe the structural and electronic properties of 16, Density Functional Theory \n(DFT) calculations were performed on the analogue 16\u2019 with the four outer fluorene units \nsubstituted with methyl groups at C(9). The intramolecular terminal C\u2026C\u2019 distance for this \nmolecule in its relaxed conformation is calculated to be 7.8 nm with the outer phenyl rings of \nthe biphenyl units twisted by 29\u00b0 relative to the aryleneethynylene backbone (Figure 3). The \nrelaxed structure possesses a \u201czigzag\u201d conformation, with the 9,9-dimethylfluorene units \nalternately oriented \u201cupwards\u201d and \u201cdownwards\u201d. Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of \nthe modulus squared of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for 16\u2019 with extensive delocalization \nalong the wire. The HOMO and LUMO peaks of the bis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl)fluorene \nunits are located 1.40 eV below the HOMO and 1.26 eV above the LUMO of the whole \nmolecule, respectively.  This separation in energy is a consequence of the large \nelectronegativity of the fluorine atoms which push the bonding and antibonding states \ndownwards and upwards in energy, respectively, and the presence of the alkane chains, \n  \n \n9\nwhich, due to their insulating behavior, isolate the pentafluorophenoxy units from the \nbackbone. \nFigure 3. Spatial distribution of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals (purple contours) of \nmolecule 16\u2019, where the methyl groups in the calculated structure replace the hexyl groups of \nthe synthesized compound 16. Gray, green, red and blue spheres correspond to hydrogen, \ncarbon, oxygen and fluorine atoms, respectively. The calculated intramolecular terminal \nC\u2026C\u2019 distance = 7.84 nm. \nConclusions \nWe have synthesized a range of new functionalized aryleneethynylene building blocks \nleading to molecular wires of up to ca. 8 nm in length which are amenable to full \nspectroscopic and analytical characterization. A key feature of the synthetic protocol is the \nclean removal from the terminal alkynes of a 2-hydroxy-2-propyl protecting group in the \npresence of a trimethylsilyl group at the other terminus. The alkyne termini of 16 make this \nmolecule a candidate for future hard-wiring into hybrid silicon\/molecule\/silicon \n  \n \n10\nnanostructures by covalent C-Si linkages. Moreover, the presence of \nbis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl) substituents on the central fluorene unit in 16 establishes that \nthis methodology is applicable for the incorporation of more elaborate pendant groups into \nthis class of molecular electronic materials.  \nExperimental Section \n9,9-Bis(3-pentafluorophenoxypropyl)-2,7-diiodofluorene 4: To a suspension of 2,7-\ndiiodofluorene 3 (1.78 g, 4.25 mmol) in THF (40 mL) under argon, NaOH (1.2 g, 30 mmol) \nin water (1.5 mL) was added in one portion.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments (Table S1) for 4 and \n11 were carried out on a Bruker 3-circle diffractometer with a SMART 6K CCD area \ndetector, using graphite-monochromated Mo-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.71073 \u00c5) and Cryostream \n(Oxford Cryosystems) open-flow N2 cryostats. The structures were solved by direct methods \nand refined by full-matrix least squares against F2 of all data, using SHELXTL 6.14 software \n(Bruker AXS, Madison, WI, USA, 2003). For 4 an absorption correction was made by \nnumerical integration based on crystal face-indexing (transmission factors 0.5154 to 0.8968).  \nAs shown in the text (Fig. 1) the asymmetric unit of 4 comprises two molecules. The \ncrystal packing reveals segregated stacks of fluorene and pentafluorophenyl moieties rather \nthan the usual mixed stack motif of alternating arene and perfluoroarene moieties or \nmolecules.[1,2] Each iodine atom forms one or two short intermolecular I\u2026C contacts (3.46 to \n3.57 \u00c5, cf. the sum of van der Waals radii[3] of 3.80 \u00c5) with the outer (6-membered) rings of \nthe fluorene moieties. In these contacts, the C-I bonds are roughly perpendicular to the \nfluorene planes.  \nThe crystal packing of compound 11 is rather loose (21 \u00c53 per non-hydrogen atom). \nBoth n-hexyl chains of the molecule are intensely disordered; the most probable \nconformations are shown in the text. The dihedral angle between the (planar) fluorene moiety \nand the benzene ring C(28-33) equals 76.8\u00ba; the angle between the latter ring and the C(34-\n S5\n39) ring equals 29.1\u00ba. The two molecules, related by an inversion centre (1 1.5 1), are linked \nby a pair of hydrogen bonds of type O-H\u2026\u03c0{C(45)\u2261C(46)} between the hydroxyl group and \nthe \u03c0-system of the alkyne bond. \n \nTable S1.

UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of 16 in chloroform solution.  \n \n \n \n S7\nTheoretical Studies \nThe theoretical structural and electronic properties were obtained using Density Functional \nTheory[4] as implemented in the SIESTA package.[5] The ionic cores were substituted by \nnorm-conserving pseudopotentials parametrized with the recipe of Troullier and Martins.[6] \nThe single particle molecular states were calculated using a linear combination of atomic \norbitals. We employed a double-\u03b6 polarized basis set: two atomic orbitals per valence \nquantum channel and one polarization shell, i.e. two s and three p for H and two s, six p and \nfive d for C, O and F. The cutoff radii were determined using an energy shift of 0.02 Ry and \nthe second \u03b6 were generated with a split-norm of 0.15. The real space grid was defined with a \nplane-wave cutoff of 300 Ry. The exchange and correlation energy was calculated with the \nLocal Density Approximation (LDA) as parametrized by Perdew and Zunger.[7] The Fermi \ndistribution function was smeared with a temperature of 75 K and the density matrix was \nconverged until the differences between consecutive iterations were smaller than 10-4. The \natomic coordinates were relaxed with a conjugated gradient method until all forces were \nsmaller than 0.03 eV\/\u00c5. \nTo find the most stable structural conformation of 16 the conjugated backbone was \ninitially relaxed with the central fluorene unit substituted with two hydrogen atoms at C(9) \nand the other four fluorene units substituted with methyl groups at C(9). The calculation \nstarted from a straight backbone conformation, where all the conjugated aryl groups were \naligned along the z direction. However, after relaxation the structure moved to a \u201czigzag\u201d \nconformation, with the 9,9-dimethylfluorene units alternately oriented \u201cupwards\u201d and \n\u201cdownwards\u201d, as can be seen in Figure 2. The intramolecular terminal C\u2026C\u2019 distance for \nthis hypothetical molecule was found to be 7.85 nm with the outer phenyl rings of the \nbiphenyl units twisted by 29\u00b0 relative to the aryleneethynylene backbone. The \nbis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl) substituents were then attached to the central fluorene unit \nand the whole structure was relaxed again. As expected, the backbone structure did not \nchange appreciably and the intramolecular terminal C\u2026C\u2019 distance was 7.84 nm. However, \nthe bis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl) units moved to a open configuration, where their oxygen \natoms were separated by a distance of 5.94 \u00c5 [cf. intramolecular O\u2026O\u2019 distances of  6.49 \nand 6.62 \u00c5 in the X-ray crystal structure of 4 shown in Figure 1]. Figure 2 shows the spatial \ndistribution of the modulus squared of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for this analog of 16 \n(i.e. 16\u2019). We have checked that such a conformation corresponds to the absolute energy \nminimum by starting from different initial separations of the bis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl) \nunits in a backbone of reduced length [namely, the model fragment 2,7-diethynyl-9,9-bis(3-\n S8\npentafluorophenoxypropyl)fluorene] and verifying that they either relax to higher-energy \nminima or relax to the above lowest-energy conformation.  \nBy using the projected density of states or comparing the density of states of the \nisolated backbone with the density of states of 16\u2019 it is possible to find out which states are \nassociated with the main backbone and which are associated only with the 9,9-\nbis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl)fluorene units. The HOMO and LUMO peaks of the \nbis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl)fluorene units are located 1.40 eV below the HOMO and 1.26 \neV above the LUMO of the whole molecule, respectively.  This separation in energy is a \nconsequence of the large electronegativity of the fluorine atoms which push the bonding and \nantibonding states downwards and upwards in energy, respectively, and the presence of the \nalkane chains, which, due to their insulating behavior, isolate the pentafluorophenoxy units \nfrom the backbone. As a consequence, the states of the backbone and the states associated \nwith the bis(pentafluorophenoxypropyl)fluorene units can be considered to be spatially and \nenergetically detached. \n \nCopies of NMR Spectra \n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n \nppm-0 12345678\n0.30\n33.47\n32.04\n32.87\n1.28\n0.03\n S9\n1H NMR spectrum of compound 4 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n3\n.\n0\n2\n8\n1\n2\n.\n9\n4\n7\n6\n1\n.\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n.\n9\n9\n1\n4\n5\n.\n9\n5\n6\n4\n1\n1\n.\n8\n9\n4\n5\n.\n7\n7\n3\n1\n4\n.\n0\n2\n2\n2\nI\nn\nt\ne\ng\nr\na\nl\n( ppm )\n0. 51. 01. 52. 02. 53. 03. 54. 04. 55. 05. 56. 06. 57. 07. 5\n \n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 6 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \nppm-0 12345678\n21.35\n12.34\n22.64\n21.72\n21.96\n S10\n1H NMR spectrum of compound 7 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 9 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n \nppm-0 12345678\n6.46\n9.71\n28.79\n29.97\n14.84\n10.24\nppm-0 123456 78\n33.15\n0.69\n3.63\n24.95\n37.58\n S11\n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 10 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 11 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \nppm-0 12345678\n44.49\n5.16\n50.35\nppm-0 12345678\n20.76\n3.46\n0.49\n8.64\n11.29\n0.96\n21.03\n10.52\n7.24\n15.61\n S12\n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 12 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n \n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 13 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \nppm-0 12345678\n28.06\n1.78\n7.91\n24.60\n12.38\n8.08\n17.20\nppm-0 12345678\n19.04\n1.89\n8.69\n7.03 27.68 4.3412.998.899.46\n S13\n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 14 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n 1H NMR spectrum of compound 15 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \nppm-0 123456 78\n23.22\n0.12 1.02 9.03 29.923.2414.579.139.73\nppm-0 12345678\nCHCl3 CH2Cl2 \n S14\n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 16 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 17 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \nppm-0 12345678\n28.72\n8.08\n24.59\n12.45\n8.34\n17.82\nppm-0 123456 78\nCHCl3 \nCH2Cl2 \n S15\n \n1H NMR spectrum of compound 18 in CDCl3 at 400 MHz. \n \n \n \nReferences for the Supporting Information \n \n[1]  T.
