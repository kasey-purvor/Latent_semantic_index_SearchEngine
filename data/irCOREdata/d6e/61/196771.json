Introduction \n \nAirborne laser scanning (ALS) data are increasingly being used for land cover mapping. There are two \ndistinct techniques used in ALS systems based on how the return signal is recorded \u2013 discrete return \nand full-waveform. Full-waveform ALS data give additional information about the objects in the path \nof the laser pulse, when compared to discrete return ALS data. In a full-waveform scanner, the \nreturn signal is the product of the transmitted laser pulse and the scattering function of the target or \ntargets. The temporal shape of the return signal is often referred to as waveform. In the case of a \nsingle flat target perpendicular to the incident laser beam, the waveform is a smaller version of the \ntransmitted signal in terms of shape. The waveform recording ALS systems record the entire time-\nvarying power of the return signal from all illuminated surfaces. The waveform from multiple targets \nis complex, and represents the sum of the signals from the individual targets. It is often decomposed \ninto components representing the individual targets. Many approaches to the interpretation of ALS \ndata are based on Gaussian decomposition. Its underlying assumption is that the scattering \nproperties of a cluster of targets can be described by a Gaussian function. An extended target could \nbe described by a series of Gaussian functions, where each pulse represents a cluster of targets too \nclose to be differentiated. This method gives estimates of the location and scattering properties of \nthe targets (Hofton et al., 2000; Mallet and Bretar, 2009; Wagner et al., 2006). \n \nAmplitude, echo width and the number of returns are the additional information obtained from full-\nwaveform data, which have been successfully used for classification. The maximum amplitude is a \nmeasure of the strength of the echo. The echo width could refer either to the full width at half the \nmaximum (FWHM) amplitude, or the standard deviation, of the pulse in the Gaussian \ndecomposition. The main methods used by the classification studies using full-waveform ALS data \nare decision trees (Ducic et al., 2006; Rutzinger et al., 2008) and support vector machines (Bretar et \nal., 2009; Mallet et al., 2008). Ducic et al. (2006) used a decision tree to classify ALS points into \nvegetation (trees and shrubs) and non-vegetation (grass, roof and road) using attributes from full-\nwaveform ALS data. In this study, although the points from grass and road could be separated based \non amplitude, grass had similar range of amplitudes to building roofs. Since their aim was to classify \npoints without using elevation or relationship to adjacent points, grass was grouped with non-\nvegetation for generating the decision tree. Rutzinger et al. (2008) used a decision tree to classify \npoints from full-waveform ALS data to detect tall vegetation \u2013 trees and shrubs, based on the \nhomogeneity of echo width. Segment statistics were calculated by aggregating attributes such as \namplitude and surface roughness for a training area. This was used to construct a decision tree to \nclassify the ALS data. They achieved accuracies above 90% for the validation sites.  \n \nThe amplitude values would vary for a given target depending on the flying height or elevation \ndifferences, even within a single dataset. Multi-temporal analysis using amplitude values, from \ndifferent ALS systems, scan geometry and atmospheric conditions, would require the values to be \nconverted to comparable measurements. The additional information provided by the decomposition \nof full-waveform ALS data is suitable for calibration, whereby amplitude and echo width are \nconverted to values proportional to the surface reflectance of the target (Coren and Sterzai, 2006; \nH\u00f6fle and Pfeifer, 2007; Kaasalainen et al., 2007; Wagner et al., 2008b). \n \nIn radar remote sensing, the backscattering or backscatter cross section, also referred to as radar \ncross section is of the most interest. Since lidar (the technique used in laser scanning) is considered \nto be an extension of radar to shorter wavelengths, the radar cross section is often used to \nunderstand the characteristics of the return signal from laser scanning. The backscatter cross section \nof a target, usually represented by the Greek letter sigma (\uf073), is equal to the physical cross sectional \narea of an idealised isotropic target, which has the same intensity as the selected target. It has \ndimensions of area, in m2 (Wagner et al., 2006; Woodhouse, 2006). \n3 \n \nThe radar equation has been used to explain the strength of the return signal in ALS, and to derive \nthe backscatter cross section. When measurements from different flight conditions and instruments \nare to be compared, the measured receiver power has to be converted into backscatter cross \nsection. The backscatter cross section is derived from the range (distance from the sensor to the \ntarget), amplitude and width of an echo. The calibration constant is a single value that sums up the \nparameters that are constant for a particular flight taking into consideration the system and \natmospheric parameters. The calibration constant can be estimated using reference targets with a \nknown backscatter cross section, or a known surface reflectance at the wavelength of the sensor. \nAsphalt roads have been used for deriving the calibration constant based on an assumed or field-\nmeasured reflectance value (Briese et al., 2008; Wagner et al., 2006). This is discussed further in \nsection 3.3.  \n \nThe backscatter cross section need not correspond to the actual cross sectional area of the target, \nand for a small discrete target, the value would remain the same with a decrease or increase in the \nilluminated area. However, for an extended target, like bare ground, the backscatter cross section \nwould increase or decrease in proportion to the illuminated area. This makes it difficult to compare \nthe cross sections of targets, with similar scattering properties, but different physical areas. The \nbackscatter coefficient is a normalised measure of the backscatter cross section irrespective of the \narea of the footprint (Woodhouse, 2006).                      \n \nBackscatter cross section and backscatter coefficient have been suggested as suitable values for \ndescribing the scattering properties of targets, and for calibration (Wagner et al., 2008b). However, \nthey have not yet been analysed as potential attributes in the classification of urban areas. Even in \nthe case of decision tree classifiers using amplitude and echo width, a method developed based on \nvalues from one study area has not been used to classify data with a different scanning geometry \nfrom another study area. In this study, amplitude, backscatter cross section and backscatter \ncoefficient are compared for use as attributes in the classification of urban areas into vegetation, \nroads and building roofs. The amplitude values in one study area are calibrated to obtain the \nbackscatter cross section and backscatter coefficient of each point in the training data. Amplitude, \nbackscatter cross section and backscatter coefficient are used to construct decision trees for \nclassifying the ALS points. The decision trees are then used to classify data points from the second \nstudy area to assess the influence of the flying height and scan angle on these attributes, and on the \naccuracy of classification. \n \nVegetation is subdivided into grass, shrubs and trees based on height (<0.5 m, 0.5-2.5 m and >2.5 \nm), and buildings are subdivided into those with flat and pitched roofs. The other attributes used for \nclassification are echo width, normalised elevation, average and standard deviation of slopes, \nstandard deviation of aspect, height variation and number of echoes. The classes and the derivation \nof spatial attributes are discussed in more detail in Alexander et al. (2008). The accuracies of the \nthree classifications of the second study area are compared. Aerial photographs and a digital \ntopographic map (OS MasterMap\u00ae) are used only for analysis, and for creating training and \nreference data. \n \n \n2. Study Area and Datasets \n \nFull-waveform ALS datasets were collected from Bristol and Bournemouth using LiteMapper 5600 \nAirborne Lidar Terrain Mapping System, in August 2006 and June 2008, respectively. The LiteMapper \nsystem makes use of RIEGL LMS-Q560 laser scanner. The sensor used in this system emits laser \npulses at a wavelength of 1 550 nm. The system has a laser beam divergence angle of 0.5 mrad, \nwhich produces a footprint diameter of approximately 0.5 m (1000 x 0.5 x 10-3) on a target at nadir, \n4 \n \nfrom a flying height of 1km. The footprint diameter increases with the range or flying height, and the \noff-nadir footprints are elliptical. The two datasets differ in the heights from which data were \ncollected, and the maximum scan angles.  \n \nIn Bristol, data were captured at a height of approximately 950 m above ground level, at a speed of \n65 ms-1 with a laser scanning pulse rate of 50 kHz. The maximum scan angle for the dataset was \n22.5\u00b0 from nadir. The point density ranged from 0.5-0.8 points m-2 per flight line. The average \nfootprint diameter on the target at nadir with a laser beam divergence of 0.5 mrad is approximately \n0.475 m. An area of 1 km x 1 km was chosen from Easting 354 000 to 355 000 (longitude 2\u00b039'50'' W \nto 2\u00b038'59'' W) and Northing 178 000 to 179 000 (latitude 51\u00b029'56'' N to 51\u00b030'29'' N), which \nincludes a range of land use and land cover types. In addition to stands of trees, there are trees \nalong the road, shrubs in gardens in the residential areas as well as grassland. The land use includes \nresidential and institutional areas and agricultural land. Four flight strips, with overlaps, covered the \nwhole study area.  \n \nThe second study area is in Bournemouth (Figure 1), with an area of 0.5 km x 0.5 km from Easting \n408 750 to 409 250 (longitude 1\u00b052'38'' W to 1\u00b052'13'' W) and Northing 91 500 to 92 000 (latitude \n50\u00b043'23'' N to 50\u00b043'39'' N). It is a more complex site than the one in Bristol. Horseshoe common, in \nthe middle of the study area, has a variety of trees on a sloping terrain. The road network is also \ncomplex with bridges and flyovers. The full-waveform data were collected from a height of \napproximately 300 m and a maximum scan angle of 30\u00b0. The study area was covered by the swath \nwidths of seven flight lines. The footprint diameter on the target collected from a flying height of \n300 m at nadir is 0.15 m. The major axis of the elliptical footprint at the maximum scan angle of 30\u00b0 \nis about 15% longer, and the area is about 54% larger. \n \n \n         \nFigure 1.

Methodology \n \nThe calibration constants for the two study areas can be calculated based on assumptions about the \nreflectance of asphalt at the wavelength of the sensor. Wagner et al. (2006) derived the value of the \ncalibration constant based on the assumption that an asphalt road has a reflectance of 0.2 at a \nwavelength of 1 550 nm.  Briese et al. (2008) made use of a reflectometer developed by Riegl, to \nmeasure the reflectance of three surfaces of interest: two sections of asphalt road and one building \n5 \n \nroof. The Riegl reflectometer made use of a laser diode operating at 1 550 nm, producing a spot of \napproximately 0.15 m diameter at a distance of 1-1.5 m. The reflectance of two Spectralon\u00ae \nreference targets, of reflectance 99% and 60%, were measured using the reflectometer and used to \ncalculate the reflectance of the areas of interest. In this case, the reflectance of asphalt at the said \nwavelength was found to be 0.25. A reflectance of 0.25 is therefore used in this study. \n \nInitially, the calibration constants for the two study areas are calculated. The backscatter cross \nsections are calculated based on this value. The backscatter cross sections for the two study areas \nwould have been comparable if the flying height and footprint diameters were the same. Since this is \nnot the case, the backscatter coefficients are calculated by normalising the backscatter cross \nsections with the area of the footprint. Decision tree classifiers are generated using amplitude, \nbackscatter cross section and the backscatter coefficient derived from the training points in Bristol. \nThese decision tree classifiers are then applied on the data from Bournemouth. The classifications \nare compared to determine whether the calibrated intensity values give advantages over amplitude, \nin terms of accuracy. \n  \n \n3.1 Pre-processing  \n \nThe raw waveforms from Bristol and Bournemouth were decomposed using the commercial package \nRiAnalyze 560. RiWorld 560 was used to transform the data into WGS Cartesian coordinates. The \ndataset was transformed to British National Grid, using Grid InQuest (Quest, 2009), before further \nanalysis. The point density ranged from 0.5-0.8 points m-2 for each flight line in Bristol. All the echoes \nwere used for the analysis, which along with the overlapping swath widths of the flight lines \ngenerated above 1 000 000 points giving an average point density of approximately 1 point m-2. The \nnumber of echoes denotes whether the point is one of a single, two, three or more hits of a single \nemitted pulse. 94.32% of the points were first echoes, 5.4% were second echoes, 0.28% third echoes \nand 0.06% fourth echoes. 88.97% of the points were single echoes, and only one point was a fifth \necho. \n \nThe dataset from Bournemouth contained 12 914 815 points from seven flight lines, providing a \npoint density of above 50 points m-2. The points had to be thinned to make a better comparison with \nthe data from Bristol, which was approximately 1 point m-2. A point shapefile was created with \npoints at 1 m spacing in a grid within the study area. Data points that were nearest to the grid points \nwere selected. In the case of multiple echoes, all echoes with the same time stamp were also added \nto the selection. After thinning, there were 337 198 points in an area of 250 000 sq. m in the dataset \nin Bournemouth. \n \n \n3.2 Attributes for generating decision trees \n \nAmplitude, elevation, echo width, echo number and the number of echoes are the attributes of \nindividual points extracted from the full-waveform data. The amplitude values of roads and trees are \nlower than those of grass, shrubs and buildings. Although there are overlaps in the values, amplitude \nis a useful attribute in separating road and grass. The normalised elevation is useful in separating \nbuildings from the other classes, especially road and grass. \n \nThe spatial relationships between neighbouring points were derived based on a TIN, which was \ncreated from the elevation of all the points. The attributes used in the decision tree were average \nand standard deviation of slopes of TIN triangles attached to each point, standard deviation of \naspect and height variation. \n6 \n \n \nThe height of points from the ground can be useful in distinguishing different surfaces. With the use \nof additional attributes derived from the TIN, it is hoped that the classifier would work even with a \nrough digital terrain model (DTM). A rough DTM was therefore created from the elevation of ALS \npoints, making use of the lowest point in a 10 m grid. A TIN was created from these points. The \nterrain elevation obtained from this TIN surface was subtracted from the elevation of each point to \nobtain an estimate of the normalised elevation. \n \n \n3.3 Calculation of the Calibration Constants  \n \nThe theoretical backscatter cross section of an echo at nadir is (Briese et al., 2008; H\u00f6fle and Pfeifer, \n2007; Jelalian, 1991; Wagner et al., 2006): \n \n\uf073           \n[1] \nwhere   is the backscatter cross section in m2,    is the reflectance of the target surface,   is the \nrange (the distance from the sensor to the target) in m and   is the laser beam divergence angle in \nradians.  \n \nFrom the radar equation, Wagner et al. (2006) derived the following equation for the \u2018apparent\u2019 \ncross section of each surface within the laser footprint: \n \n         \n    \n[2] \nwhere       is the calibration constant,   is the amplitude of the echo,  is the echo width \nAssuming a reflectance of 0.25 for asphalt, the calibration constant can be calculated from the \nequations, [1] and [2] as:  \n      \n       \n    \n \n[3] \nwhere   is the amplitude and   is the echo width of each point on the selected sections of asphalt \nroad. The laser beam divergence angle (  , is 0.5 mrad for Riegl LMS-Q560. The width of the echo \nfrom the Riegl software corresponds to the FWHM of amplitude of the Gaussian pulse. This was \nconverted to the standard deviation of the Gaussian using the formula (Weisstein, 2009): \n \n   \n    \n      \n \n[4] \nNear-nadir points from asphalt road sections were selected from the study area in Bristol. The scan \nangle being almost 90o, almost horizontal sections were chosen to avoid the influence of incidence \nangle on the echo. Points with amplitude greater than 40 were removed so that points from white \nroad markings were not included. There were 566 points from the nine road sections. The mean of \nthe calculated calibration constants, 4.45.10-6, was used for the calculation of backscatter cross \nsection and backscatter coefficients.  \n \n \n  \n7 \n \n3.4 Derivation of Backscatter Cross Sections and Backscatter Coefficients \n \nThe backscatter cross sections ( \uf073 ) for each echo were calculated using equation [2]. The values \nincrease with the area of the laser beam footprint on the target. For a particular beam width, the \narea of the footprint changes with the flying height at nadir. The cross section per unit area, denoted \nas  , is considered to be a better attribute for comparing the scattering characteristics of area-\nextensive targets which produce single echoes from different sensors and flight parameters (Ulaby \net al., 1982; Wagner et al., 2008b). The cross section per unit illuminated area (   ) is the most \nwidely used parameter in radar remote sensing. However, this requires the incidence angle of each \necho, and significant processing and modelling are necessary to estimate the local incidence angle \non an inclined surface (Wagner et al., 2008b). Although the illuminated area changes with the \nincidence angle of the beam on a given surface, the scattering strength is often related to the cross \nsection of the incoming beam for convenience (Schanda, 1986; Wagner et al., 2008b).  \n \nCross sectional area of the incoming beam (Wagner et al., 2008b), A, is: \n \n   \n       \n \n \n[5] \nwhere   is the distance from the sensor to the target in m and   is the laser-beam divergence angle \nin radians. \n \nThe back scatter cross section per unit area of the incoming beam can be calculated as (Wagner et \nal., 2008b): \n   \n\uf073\n \n \n [6] \nAmplitude and the derived attributes, \uf073  and  , were used to generate decision trees to classify the \nfull-waveform dataset.               \n \n \n3.5 Generation of Decision Trees for Classification  \n \nTraining polygons were manually delineated using the attributes of the ALS points, OS MasterMap \nand an aerial image into the six land cover classes. The attributes of points within the training \npolygons representing the different classes could now be analysed. The attributes \u2013 amplitude, echo \nwidth, number of returns, average and standard deviation of slopes, standard deviation of aspect, \nheight variation and normalised elevation \u2013 of the dataset from Bristol were used to generate a \ndecision tree for classification. Decision trees were generated, replacing the amplitude by the \nbackscatter cross section as an attribute. This was repeated using the backscatter coefficient. These \nthree decision trees, using amplitude, backscatter cross section and backscatter coefficient, were \nthen used to classify the data from Bournemouth.  \n \n \n3.6 Classification of ALS Points  \n \nA TIN was created from the thinned data points in Bournemouth, using elevation as the attribute. \nThis was converted to TIN triangles and intersected with the points, to derive additional spatial \nattributes. The thinned dataset from Bournemouth now had the following attributes for each \nreceived echo: unique identifier, time stamp, easting, northing, elevation, amplitude, echo number, \nnumber of echoes, range, scan angle and echo width.  \n8 \n \n \nTen sections of asphalt road were selected from the un-thinned Bournemouth dataset. The points \nselected were from road sections with scan angle from 89.5\u00b0 to 90.5\u00b0 and the range of heights less \nthan 0.2 m. There were 1 898 points from the ten road sections. The mean of the calculated \ncalibration constants, 17.4 x 10-6, was used for the calculation of backscatter cross section and \nbackscatter coefficients for each point in the dataset. \n \nThe three decision trees generated using the training data from Bristol were then used to classify the \npoints. The attributes \u2018class\u2019 and \u2018node\u2019 were added to the existing attributes of each point. The \npoints could now be displayed according to their class for visual analysis. The classification results \nusing the three decision trees were compared, as discussed in the following section.  \n \n \n3.7 Assessment of Accuracies  \n \nReference polygons belonging to the different classes were manually delineated using the attributes \nof the ALS points, and visual analysis of the aerial photograph and OS MasterMap. The points within \nthese reference polygons were selected for assessing the accuracies of classification. There were 3 \n520 points in all, consisting of 1 076 points from trees, 109 points from shrubs, 708 points from \ngrass, 702 points from road, 399 points from flat roofs and 526 points from pitched roofs. The class \nof the manually referenced point was added as an attribute of a point before classification. The \nclassification of points using the three decision trees were compared with the class of the reference \ndata to get an estimate of the accuracies using the different attributes. \n \n \n4. Results \n \nThe kappa coefficients, overall accuracies, average user\u2019s accuracies and average producer\u2019s \naccuracies of classification using the three decision trees are shown in Table 1. All the accuracies are \nthe highest for the third classification using   as an attribute. The calibration constants in Bristol and \nBournemouth were calculated as 4.45 x10-6 and 17.4 x 10-6 respectively. These were used to calibrate \nthe intensities of the datasets from the two study areas, and estimate the backscatter cross sections \nand backscatter coefficients.  \n \n Table 1: Kappa coefficients, overall accuracies, average user\u2019s accuracies and average producer\u2019s accuracies of the \nclassifications for the three decision trees using amplitude, \uf073 and   as attributes \n \n Amplitude \uf073   \nKappa coefficient 0.67 0.68 0.89 \nOverall Accuracy 73.44 74.52 91.53 \nAverage User's Accuracy  82.23 68.24 90.36 \nAverage Producer's Accuracy 78.93 76.70 91.11 \n \nThe classification using the decision tree with amplitude as an attribute is shown in Figure 2. A major \nmisclassification is that of road at a higher elevation than the land below as a building (Figure 3). On \nvisual analysis of the data, displayed by the assigned node number, the other major \nmisclassifications are in the nodes using amplitude (Figure 4). The resulting leaf nodes are grass, \nroad, trees and pitched roofs.   \n \n9 \n \n \nFigure 2: Points classified using the decision tree with amplitude as an attribute, converted to polygons by merging \nThiessen polygons based on class.

Discussion \n \n5.1 Comparison of the Calibration Constants \n \nThe calibration constant in Bournemouth is nearly four times the calibration constant in Bristol. As \nnoted in section 2, the average flying heights, in Bristol and Bournemouth, were 950 m and 300 m \nrespectively. This accounts for much of the difference in the values of the calibration constants in \nthe two study areas, as shown in equation [7]. From equation [3], the calibration constant is derived \nfrom the divergence angle of the laser beam, range, amplitude, and echo width of each point on the \nselected sections of asphalt road. The divergence angle of the laser beam is the same for the two \nstudy areas as the same sensor is used in both the cases. The ratio of the mean range of the selected \npoints in Bournemouth to the mean range in Bristol is approximately 2.85. Similarly, the ratios of the \nmean amplitude and echo width are approximately 0.48 and 0.98 respectively. Therefore, the ratio \nof the calibration constants in Bristol,      , and Bournemouth,       , is: \n \n       \n         \n  \n       \n ;         \n         \n  \n       \n \n \n     \n     \n  \n  \n        \n  \n        \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n  \n                         \n[7] \nwhere   is the laser beam divergence angle, and     and    are the average amplitudes and   and \n   are the average echo widths of points on the selected sections of asphalt road in Bristol and \nBournemouth. \n \nThe road sections were selected to have scan angles close to 90\u00b0 to reduce the effects of scan angles \non the amplitude and echo width. Even then, there were slight differences in the calculated \ncalibration constants within each study area. The means of the calibration constants for all the \npoints in the selected sections of road in both the study areas were used for the analysis. The mean \nof the calculated calibration constants in Bristol was found to be 4.45 x10-6, when the average of all \nthe points was calculated. When the means of the sections were calculated, and the calibration \nconstant was taken as the mean of these means, a value of 4.84 x10-6 was obtained. The slight \ndifferences in the values could be due to the differences in the age and material used for surfacing \nthe roads, leading to differences in reflectance values. This could have an impact on the calibration \nconstant, and thereby on the classification. Similarly, the mean of the calculated calibration \nconstants in Bournemouth was found to be 17.38 x 10-6, when the mean of all the points was \ncalculated. When the means of the sections were calculated, and the calibration constant was taken \nas the mean of these means, a value of 16.86 x 10-6 was obtained.  \n \n \n5.2 Accuracies of Classification \n \nThe three decision trees based on amplitude, \uf073 and   had different numbers of nodes after pruning. \nSince the decision tree using amplitude as an attribute contained 31 nodes, the two other decision \ntrees were pruned further to have a maximum of 31 nodes for a better comparison. Points from no \nother class are classified as flat roof using any of the attributes. Their user\u2019s accuracies are therefore \n100%. \n \nThe average user\u2019s and producer\u2019s accuracies are the highest for the classification using  , and the \naccuracies for all the classes are above 70% (Table 2). The decision tree using   made use of five \nadditional attributes \u2013 classified normalised elevation, height variation, average slope of TIN \n12 \n \ntriangles attached to each point, echo width and standard deviation of aspects of TIN triangles to \nprovide an overall accuracy of 91.5% and a kappa coefficient of 0.89. Ten of the nodes in the \ndecision tree using   required only three attributes for classification. Five nodes required four \nattributes, and one node required all six attributes. \n \nSome of the points classified as shrubs and within roads, were classified incorrectly due to their \nestimated elevations from the ground. Some of the other points incorrectly classified as shrubs are \nfrom vehicles, which would also have a normalised elevation greater than 0.5 m. Water has low \nreflectance in the infrared wavelengths, leading to the inland water body being classified as road \n(Figure 6). Flat roofs were classified based only on height, average slope and height variation. Grass \nand road were classified based on height and  . Average slope was used only to filter out points \nfrom trees in both grass and road. Echo width and   are used to separate trees and pitched roofs. \nThe values for echo width are generally larger for trees than pitched roofs.  \n \nThe classification using \uf073 gave the highest number of correctly classified trees. It would also seem \nfrom Table 1 that the accuracies are comparable to the one using amplitude. However, it can be \nseen from Table 2 that all the points from grass are incorrectly classified using \uf073. The majority of \nthem are classified as road. Although the producer\u2019s accuracies for the classification using \uf073 are the \nhighest for trees, shrubs and road, the accuracies for grass are 0%. It would therefore be better not \nto use this attribute for classification when all the classes are considered. \n \nTable 2: Error matrix showing points in each class in the reference data and from the decision tree classifications using \namplitude, backscatter cross section (\uf073) and backscatter coefficient ( ).

The values \nrepresenting the incorrectly classified points, which are more than 10% of the total number, are \nunderlined in the table. There are 50 251 points that are classified as pitched roofs using amplitude \nand trees using   , of which only 3 848 (7.6%) points are within the building polygons from OS \nMasterMap. The majority can therefore be considered to be correctly classified using  .  \n \n26 135 points are classified as grass using amplitude and road using   of which 15 215 (58.2%) points \nare within the polygons classified as road or track, roadside or path. Again, the majority of them are \ncorrectly classified using  . There are 3 098 points that are classified as shrubs using amplitude and \ntrees using  . These misclassifications could be less important, as they are classified as vegetation in \nboth the classifications.             \n \nTable 3: Comparison of classifications using decision trees with amplitude and   as attributes \n \n Backscatter Coefficient \nAmplitude Trees Shrubs Grass Road F-Roof P-Roof Total \nTrees 140 818 1 676 0 1 792 0 270 144 556 \nShrubs 3 098 19 367 0 0 0 0 22 465 \nGrass 77 0 49 099 26 135 0 0 75 311 \nRoad 1 0 3 15 848 0 0 15 852 \nF-Roof 0 0 0 0 4 162 0 4 162 \nP-Roof 50 251 0 0 0 0 24 601 74 852 \nTotal 194 245 21 043 49 102 43 775 4 162 24 871 337 198 \n \n \n5.3 Analysis of the Attributes \n \nThe training data in Bristol, and the manually classified points in Bournemouth, were used for \nfurther analysis of the attributes related to intensity. The training data contains \u2018purer\u2019 data than the \nmanually classified points. For example, the training points from a building would not include points \nfrom the edges. In the manually classified points, they are included to get a better idea about the \nclassification accuracy. This has to be taken into consideration when the attributes are analysed.  \n \nAs noted earlier, grass, road, pitched roof and trees require intensity for their classification, and \nthese classes are analysed in this section. The values of the echo amplitude for grass and road are \nmore clearly separated in the Bristol data than in Bournemouth (Figure 7). There is considerable \noverlap between the amplitudes of pitched roofs and trees in Bournemouth. \n \n \n \nFigure 7: Frequency distribution of the amplitudes of echoes from grass, road, trees and pitched roofs in Bristol and \nBournemouth   \n \nThe values for amplitude and backscatter cross section seem to be very different for the two study \nareas (Figure 8). The amplitude values for grass and road are higher in Bournemouth than in Bristol. \n14 \n \nThis is because of the differences in the altitudes from which the data were captured. The energy of \nthe return signal is usually higher at a lower altitude, due to the reduction in the distance between \nthe sensor and the target. The values for backscatter cross section are higher in Bristol than in \nBournemouth, in contrast to the amplitudes. This could also be due to similar reasons as above. A \nhigher flying height would mean a decrease in the energy of the return signal, and would require a \nlarger area, or backscatter cross section, to represent the idealised scatterer, as described in section \n1. The value of the backscatter cross section used to separate grass and road in the decision tree \nclassifier is also shown in Figure 8. Since it was derived from the training dataset in Bristol, it seems \nto separate grass and road in Bristol quite well. However, all the values for grass in Bournemouth are \nless than this value. This accounts for the null accuracies for grass using backscatter cross section. \n \nFigure 8: Frequency distribution of the amplitudes, backscatter cross sections and backscatter coefficients of echoes from \ngrass and road in Bristol and Bournemouth. The values of the attributes used for separating grass and road in the decision \ntree classifiers are also shown. \n \nThe amplitude values for trees and pitched roofs are higher in Bournemouth than in Bristol (Figure \n9). As seen in the case of grass and road, the backscatter cross sections are also higher in Bristol than \nin Bournemouth. The pitched roofs and trees can be differentiated better using  . In the case of \nmultiple echoes, the values for   are derived by dividing the backscatter cross section of each point \nwith the area of the circular footprints, and not with the area of each individual target. Therefore, \nthere might be a difference between the values of   for single and multiple echoes in the case of \ntrees.   \n15 \n \n \n \nFigure 9: Frequency distribution of the amplitudes, backscatter cross sections backscatter coefficients of echoes from \npitched roofs and trees in Bristol and Bournemouth \n \nThis was analysed further by separating the single echoes and the multiple echoes from trees in \nBournemouth. In  , the multiple echoes from trees can be differentiated more easily than single \nechoes when compared with pitched roofs. This probably accounts for the incorrect classifications of \ntrees as building roofs. This can also be seen from the values of the backscatter coefficients used in \nthe decision trees (Figure 10). \n \n \nFigure 10: Backscatter coefficients of pitched roofs and trees in Bournemouth. The single and multiple echoes from trees \nare shown separately. The values of the attributes used for separating trees and pitched roofs in the decision tree \nclassifiers are also shown. \n \n \n 6. Conclusion \n \nThis study suggests that full-waveform data could be more useful than discrete return data for \ntopographic mapping as intensity is a very useful attribute in classification, and calibration of \nintensity is currently possible only with full-waveform data. As the amplitude values are dependent \non various factors such as flying height, scan angle and weather conditions, calibrated intensity \nmight be necessary to make any classification method transferable. Backscatter coefficient, derived \nfrom echo amplitude, width and range, proved more useful than amplitude and backscatter cross \n16 \n \nsection in a decision tree classifier, when it has to be used on different datasets with differing flying \nheights and maximum scan angles, especially for natural and artificial ground. \n \nThe reflectance of asphalt chosen for calculating the calibration constant could have an influence on \nthe results of the classifications. The calibration constants for both the datasets were calculated \nassuming the reflectance of asphalt to be 0.25 from Briese et al. (2008). However, the fact sheet for \nthe scanning system gives this value as 0.20. From equation [7], the chosen values did not make a \ndifference to the ratio of the calibration constants, as long as they were the same for the two sites. \nThe classification can probably be improved by on-site calibration before or after data capture. The \ncalculation of normalised elevation is dependent on the accuracy of the DTM. While a rough DTM \nmay be sufficient for an area with flat terrain, in complicated areas with bridges and flyovers, as in \nthe study area in Bournemouth, a more accurate DTM might produce a better classification.  \n  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis study was conducted with financial support and data from Ordnance Survey, Southampton, and \na scholarship from the University of Leicester.
