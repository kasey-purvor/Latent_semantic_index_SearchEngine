Introduction \n    The middle Iron Age cemetery at Wetwang Slack is located in East \nYorkshire, UK (Fig. 1).  The extended site is of outstanding interest, having \nboth settlement and burial evidence which date back to the Neolithic and \ncontinue into the Romano-British period [19], with the largest sample of late \nprehistoric structures in East Yorkshire [20].  It is situated in an area on the \nYorkshire Wolds which is a rich prehistoric landscape of barrows and linear \nearthworks [18].  The extensive formal inhumation cemetery, including two-\nwheeled vehicle (or \u2018chariot\u2019) burials, is exceptional for the British Iron Age \nand the site (covering both the cemetery and a settlement area) has produced \none of the largest animal bone assemblages available for that period.       \n    Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis has been applied to collagen \nfrom both human and animal bone samples, the technique facilitating a direct \nreconstruction of protein levels in the diet over the long-term [2, 27].  This \nallows exploration of general subsistence patterns for the population.  The \nstudy was undertaken primarily to characterize the human diet for the Iron \nAge group at the site and to identify any dietary differences present between \nstatus, sex, age and site phase groups. \n2.  Background \n2.1  The site \n    The site at Wetwang and Garton Slack (SE 945 600) extends across a \nparish boundary and encompasses a cemetery containing over 450 burials \nwith La T\u00e8ne-style artefacts, probably dating to the fourth to second centuries \nBC [19, 32, 50, 51] and in use over several centuries [17].  Given the scarcity \nof British Iron Age inhumations, this provides a population sample of a size \nrarely encountered.  Excavations by Brewster and Dent took place from the \nlate 1960s through to the 1980s, the area being under threat from gravel \nextraction as work proceeded [10, 19].  Bone from a range of animal species \nwas available from both the settlement area and the grave inclusions, allowing \na herbivore \u2018baseline\u2019 to be produced for the particular environmental \nconditions of the time and place against which the human diet can be \ncompared.  The large human skeletal sample, together with the presence of \ncontemporaneous animal bone, make the site particularly suitable for stable \nisotope analysis. \n    The burial tradition seen at the Wetwang Slack cemetery involves barrows \nsurrounded by four-sided ditches (often described as \u2018square\u2019 barrows), with \noccasional two-wheeled vehicles (or \u2018chariots\u2019) found within the graves.  \nBurials of this type are found concentrated in the Yorkshire Wolds, extending \nsoutheast into Holderness, west into the centre of the Vale of York and north \nacross the Vale of Pickering onto the southern edges of the North York Moors \n[51].  They are often labelled \u2018Arras culture\u2019, the type-site being that of Arras \nnear Market Weighton, where around 100 burials were excavated at the \nbeginning of the nineteenth century [51].  \n    More than  half of the Wetwang inhumations are in primary positions \nbeneath barrows within their own enclosures.  These are supplemented by \nsecondary barrow inhumations and many flat graves and ditch burials which \nhave been inserted into the space available.  Fourteen of the graves \nexcavated by Dent contained animal remains which, along with pottery \ninclusions, appear to indicate that food offerings were made.  In nine of these \ngraves they consisted of single sheep humeri within pots, with three graves \nincluding pig front quarters, one containing badly preserved pig fragments and \nthe last grave containing both a complete pig and a complete goat [44].  Other \ngrave goods included brooches, bracelets, beads and pins, with the \noccasional richer burial including a two-wheeled vehicle or weapons [19].  The \nvehicle burial discovered locally in 2001 also included pig remains [24, 25]. \n    There are six of the well-known vehicle burials from the Wetwang and \nGarton Slack location, including that of the 2001 find [24, 11, 25] and a further \n\u2018cart-type\u2019 burial, where the vehicle itself was not preserved, but Brewster \nsuggested it may have been included [9, 10].  The number found here makes \nthis group of such burials the largest in Britain, with only a further twelve \nothers known, ten of which are from other sites in East and North Yorkshire [9, \n51].  The two outside this area are both recent discoveries, one being from \nWest Yorkshire (Ferrybridge [7, 8], which has been analysed as part of this \nresearch and which will be published separately) and the other being from \nEdinburgh (Newbridge, the context containing no preserved bone [13, 14]). \n    These two-wheeled vehicles and the burial form generally have led to \nsuggestions in the past that the Iron Age populations of the Yorkshire Wolds \nwere originally immigrants, since burials showing similarities to those from \nnorthern France have been found in that region [10, 15, 49].  However, current \nopinion sees variations between the Yorkshire burials and those seen on the \nContinent as evidence that the immigration of a group is unlikely, although the \naffinities make it probable that there had been some form of contact [23]. \n    The animal bone from Wetwang and Garton comprises a large and \nimportant assemblage.  The Brewster and Dent excavations together \nproduced over 23,600 identified fragments, the majority from the Iron Age, but \nalso a significant amount of Roman material [35, 44].  To put this into context, \nmost British Iron Age vertebrate collections have either not been quantified or \nelse have consisted of less than 1,000 identified fragments, notable \nexceptions being mainly from central southern England [22, 31]. \n \n2.2  The technique \n    Analysis of the carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in bone collagen has \nbeen in use as a technique for reconstructing diet in archaeological material \nfor over 25 years [e.g., 53].  General reviews can be found in [2, 27] and [46].  \nThe theory is based upon the principle that the amino acids from which the \ncollagen is composed are themselves formed from chemical elements which \nare ingested, mainly in the form of protein.  The relationship between the \nisotopes in food is, therefore, reflected in some recognizable way in the \nisotope ratios in bone collagen.  The technique is quantitative in nature, \ninvolving measurement of ratios of the isotopes, and it is also relative, in that \ngeographical and temporal differences in the signals make absolute numbers \nfor an individual human of little utility without localized comparative data from \nthe population and from animals of known trophic level.  The isotopic values \ncalculated are given in units \u2030 (per mil, or parts per thousand) and reflect the \nratio of two stable isotopes (13C and 12C for carbon, 15N and 14N for nitrogen) \nin a sample as compared to a standard.  They are given as \u03b413C and \u03b415N \nvalues. \n    Isotopic datasets have been used to address hypotheses relating to a wide \nrange of issues such as health and nutrition [e.g., 26], weaning age [e.g., 43], \nsubsistence base [e.g., 40], mobility [e.g., 38, 42, 45] and social status [e.g., \n33].  The major distinctions to be made for prehistoric Britain are in terms of \nlevels of animal protein consumed, high proportions in the diet elevating the \nnitrogen signal, and also in identifying marine foods, which elevate the \nnitrogen signal at the same time as leading to a less negative carbon value.  \nFor British prehistory the distinction between consumption of C3 and C4 \nplants, which can be identified with the \u03b413C signal, is not useful.  These plant \ngroups have different photosynthetic pathways, leading to different carbon \nisotope values, but C4 plants were not widely available during this period in \ntemperate Europe.  Millet (a C4 plant) has, however, been suggested as part \nof the diet in Iron Age Slovenia and Bohemia [29, 33]. \n    Collagen has a long turnover period in adults, believed to be in the region \nof 10 to 15 years for long bone cortex, so that the signatures obtained relate \nto a lifetime\u2019s diet, rather than to short-term consumption [30, 52, 54].  The \ndata presented in this paper for humans are primarily from rib and it is \ngenerally considered that this will provide a shorter-term signal than seen in \nlong bone [e.g., 45], although the period involved is still likely to consist of a \nnumber of years.  It is believed that the collagen reflects the protein content of \nthe diet, largely excluding the carbon which has come from ingested \ncarbohydrates and fats [3, 4].  At present, it is not possible to differentiate \nbetween the consumption of different types of animal protein, with meat and \ndairy products producing similar signatures. \n3.  Methods \n    Data are presented here for 62 human samples and 68 animals.  The Iron \nAge humans have been selected to include both sexes, a range of ages, \nsubjective status groups and two cemetery site phases.  A further 41 infant \nand child samples are not described in this paper, but will be presented \nelsewhere. \n    Collagen was extracted from human and animal bone samples using the \nstandard procedures outlined in Richards and Hedges [39], modified by the \nuse of a Millipore Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter (30,000 NMWL) prior to \nlyophilization so that molecules over 30 kD were retained [12].  The collagen \nyields presented in Tables 1 and 2 must be considered in the light of the use \nof these filters.  Tests undertaken on six human samples randomly chosen \nfrom those analysed here indicate that the yield is reduced to approximately \n40% of the yield which would have been produced for this material without this \nstage, this being dependent upon the preservation of the collagen in individual \nsamples.  All samples listed in the Tables have yields in excess of 1%.  For \nthe few below 1.8% (this being considered indicative of poor quality collagen \nwhen these filters are not used [1]) the data are considered acceptable on the \nbasis of the expected yield reduction combined with the C:N ratios and \nelement percentages obtained. \n    The bone element sampled for humans was rib in all cases except WWH \n155 and the Iron Age fragment which was not from a burial, these being from \nlong bone cortex.  The samples were all taken by the first author directly from \nthe boxed human skeletons and, other than for those burials which included \nquite specific animal remains as grave goods (see above), there was little \nlikelihood of animal bone being present in these.  It is not considered likely \nthat misidentified animal bone was confused during the sampling process.  \nAnimal samples were from various bone elements, depending on the material \nidentified to species (see Table 2).  The collagen was combusted to CO2 and \nN2 and analysed using either a Thermo Finnigan DELTAplus XL continuous \nhelium flow gas isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a Flash EA \n1112 elemental analyser or an Europa Scientific Geo 20\/20 isotope ratio mass \nspectrometer coupled to a Roboprep elemental analyser, both at the \nUniversity of Bradford.  The analytical \u03c3, averaged from standards run with the \nsamples, amounted to \u00b1 0.2\u2030 for both \u03b413C and \u03b415N.  The isotope values \npresented are averaged from two replicates, analysed in separate batches, \nexcept where one replicate was discarded due to analytical problems or a C:N \nratio outside of the range 2.9 to 3.6 [16]. \n4.  Results \n4.1  The group as a whole     \nThe human data are presented in Table 1.  Averages for adolescent and adult \nhumans (defined here as age 12 and over), together with those for mature \nsheep, pigs and dogs and for young pigs are shown on the chart in Figure 2.  \nThe human \u03b413C values for 61 of the 62 individuals (excluding WWH 14) \nrange from -21.2\u2030 to -19.9\u2030 (average -20.5\u2030; \u03c3 \u00b1 0.3\u2030) with \u03b415N values \nfrom 8.6\u2030 to 11.2\u2030 (average 9.6\u2030; \u03c3 \u00b1 0.5\u2030).  Data for the animals are \npresented in Table 2.  The average carbon and nitrogen values for the sheep \n(n = 15) are -21.7\u2030 (\u03c3 \u00b1 0.5\u2030) and 5.0\u2030 (\u03c3 \u00b1 1.0\u2030) respectively, excluding \nthe immature animal, and for cattle (n = 10) they are -21.5\u2030 (\u03c3 \u00b1 0.4\u2030) and \n4.6\u2030 (\u03c3 \u00b1 1.1\u2030).  The adult human averages are around 1\u2030 less negative \nfor carbon and 5\u2030 more positive for nitrogen than these herbivores. \n \n4.2  Status and outliers \nFigure 3 shows the adult and adolescent human values divided into six \nsubjective \u2018status groups\u2019: (1) vehicle burials; (2) those with other grave goods \nburied beneath barrows; (3) those beneath barrows without grave goods; (4) \nthose which are not barrow burials, but do have grave goods; (5) those \nwithout barrows or grave goods; (6) one human bone fragment which was not \nfrom a formal burial, but found with animal bone within an enclosure ditch.  \nThere are no distinctive patterns present in the data for these groups. \n    Two individual points of interest are WWH 14 and WWH 431, both marked \non Figure 3.  These have elevated \u03b415N values at 12.3\u2030 and 11.2\u2030 \nrespectively.  The value for WWH 14 is 0.8\u2030 higher than 3\u03c3 from the mean, \neven when \u03c3 is calculated to include this individual.  It is considered to be an \noutlier.  WWH 431 is closer to the mean being just within 3\u03c3, but it is still an \nextreme point given the clustering of this data-set and it is 0.7\u2030 higher than \nthe nearest lower value. \n    WWH 431 is a female from a burial without a barrow or grave goods, \nprobably in the middle adult age group [Dawes, unpublished data; 34].  The \noriginal record for this burial describes skeletal preservation as \u201cvery good, \nvery hard bone\u201d [Dawes, unpublished record card], but the most interesting \nfactor relates to the quantity of the collagen extracted.  This had a yield of \nover 16% of original bone mass, the highest for any of the Wetwang samples \n(average human yield was 5.8%, \u03c3 \u00b1 2.8%).  Comparison of collagen yields \nwith nitrogen isotopic signals for the whole adult human population did not \nreveal any correlation between the two factors.  Indeed, this would be \nunexpected since there is no indication that the collagen isotope ratios are \naffected by preservation factors where the C:N ratio is within the range \ngenerally considered to indicate the presence of acceptable quality collagen \n[16].  Since the burial is unphased, a possible explanation for the coexistence \nof a high nitrogen value and collagen yield might be that it was an intrusive \nburial.  However, this individual was included among 19 skeletons from this \ncemetery which have been recently radiocarbon dated (dates to be published \nelsewhere) and it belongs to the middle Iron Age period.  A review of the \nposition of this individual within the cemetery reveals that it is in close \nproximity to two other individuals with particularly high collagen yields, one of \nwhich was buried with an Iron Age brooch.  It is likely that collagen \ndegradation in this area of the cemetery was moderated by particularly good \npreservation conditions and that the high nitrogen value for burial 431 is \ncoincidental. \n    WWH 14 is a male over 45 years of age from a secondary interment in a \nbarrow and without any grave goods.  Collagen yield is normal, relative to the \nrest of the data-set. \n \n4.3  Sex and age \n    There is an unusual trend to be seen amongst the older males when they \nare separated from the group as a whole.  It can be seen from Figure 3 that a \ntrend is discernible in the overall data from individuals with high nitrogen and \nmore negative carbon values, down to those with lower nitrogen values and \nless negative \u03b413C.  If a trend line is plotted for all adult data-points, the r2 \nvalue is relatively low, at 0.24 (with the two extreme individuals excluded).  \nHowever, if the sexes are plotted separately, the r2 value for the female trend \nline remains low at 0.15, with the male value much higher at 0.51.  The trend \nbecomes even clearer if the males are separated according to age and Figure \n4 displays negative correlation between \u03b413C and \u03b415N for males categorised \nas over the age of 35 years, showing the r2 value at 0.60.  The correlation is \nsignificant at the 99% confidence level for this group of 16 individuals, whilst \nthat for women in the same age group is not significant (n = 10).  It is not \nconsidered to be a coincidental pattern since an extra 6 male samples were \nprocessed from the appropriate age range in order to check that they \nconformed to the trend, which they did. \n    Adolescent males in the age group 12 to 20 years do show a similar trend, \nalthough sample size is too limited to allow conclusions to be drawn (n = 4).  \nThe r2 value for the males in the age group 20 to 35 is much lower at 0.23 and \nit is again not significant (n = 10). \n    The trend outlined above is difficult to interpret.  Whilst most carbon and \nnitrogen stable isotopic data show a positive correlation in line with increasing \nlevels of animal or marine protein in the diet, this is a negative correlation.  \nWith that in mind, the trend must be particularly strong to overcome the usual \npattern.  It is also a trend which is seen within the closely clustered data-set \nfor the population, such that even the analytical precision, when considered to \n2\u03c3, encompasses a large part of it.  It is apparently unaffected by other \nconsidered factors such as status or site phase.  Perhaps it is the close \nclustering of the data for this population sample, together with the fact that all \nof the samples have been taken from one skeletal element (rib), that has \nallowed the pattern to be clearly defined. \n    No similar trends are known from published data, which would suggest that \nit is not the result of a physiological phenomenon restricted to mature males.  \nThis unusual correlation requires further research in order that a better \nunderstanding of its derivation can be obtained. \n \n4.4  Site phase     \nIsotopic values are plotted by site phase in Figure 5.  No distinction between \nthese cohorts is visible.  This is important in the discussion of the possibility of \nimmigrants forming the initial population at the site.  The lack of phase \ndistinction is reinforced by the fact that the correlation discussed above is \napparent across both phases in similar ranges of both carbon and nitrogen \nisotopic values and also by the close clustering of the values for the group.  If \na number of these individuals had come from a different area of Europe, there \nare likely to have been differences seen in the patterning across the phases \nand a greater range of values might have been expected.  This, of course, is \nbased on that part of the population which has been analysed.  Although the \nsamples have been taken from across the site, to represent all parts of the \ncemetery and all burial types, it is possible that a small immigrant group has \neluded the sampling procedure. \n5.  Discussion \n5.1  Adult Iron Age humans \nThe small shift of 1\u2030 on the carbon scale and the much larger increase in the \naverage nitrogen value of around 5\u2030 between the averages of the herbivores \nand those of the adult humans are consistent with a diet high in animal protein \n(either meat or dairy products) with no suggestion of a significant level of \nmarine foods; the latter would cause a much less negative carbon value and a \nmore elevated nitrogen signal.  It is usually expected that the trophic level \neffect will produce 15N enrichment between diet and consumer collagen \nresulting in a spacing of 2 to 4\u2030 [6, 41].  In this case, the 5\u2030 elevation is \nhigher than might be expected.  Recent research suggests that a possible \nexplanation may relate to particularly high levels of protein consumption [47, \n48].  In this case, some consumption of very young pigs (or other species) \nmight also contribute to an elevated nitrogen signal (see below).  The \nconclusion that marine foods were absent from the diet is supported by the \nfact that no fish bone was recovered from the site and by the location being \napproximately 25 km from the coast.  This is also consistent with suggestions \nthat the lack of fish bone from British Iron Age sites generally is supportive of \na situation in which fish are not often exploited during this period (e.g., 21). \n    One of the possibilities suggested for social distinction within the East \nYorkshire burial tradition relates to the inclusion of animal remains as grave \ngoods, some with pig and some with sheep [36].  The sampling programme \nused for this research encompassed two of the human burials with sheep \ninclusions, three with pig and one with both pig and goat (see Table 1).  \nAlthough it might be possible to extend this sampling at some future time to \ninclude all such burials, initial findings suggest that there are no significant \ndifferences to be found between individuals buried with the different species. \n    The small range of values (1.3\u2030 for carbon; 2.2\u2030 for nitrogen if WWH 4A, \n14 and 431 are excluded) for 60 individuals, together with the fact that no \ndistinctions can be made between different cohorts (other than the negative \ncorrelation particularly apparent in mature males), suggests a diet which was \nunusually consistent during the lives of these people and which also did not \nvary significantly across the population or over the period of use of the \ncemetery.  It is necessary to be aware, however, that a diet which is \nconsistent in terms of protein intake is not necessarily physically identical.  It is \nnot possible, for instance, to distinguish between individuals of different status \neating different cuts of meat or obtaining their protein from different mammal \nspecies.  Again, if the protein intake was similar, a distinction might not be \nseen if one group was consuming dairy produce and another meat. \n    The lack of a distinction between Early and Late site phase data may be a \nuseful contribution to the discussion of the possibility of immigration from \nFrance or elsewhere [15, 49].  Whilst carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis is \nnot a technique specifically useful in the consideration of mobility, it should be \nnoted that different environments produce varying signals, which is the reason \nfor comparing the animal data with that for humans for any particular location \nor time period.  With this in mind, early immigrants to the Wetwang site might \nbe expected to look at least marginally different from those appearing in the \nLate phase.  WWH 14 and, perhaps, 431 are suggestive of such differences.  \nHowever, it might be expected that an early immigrant group would have \nformed the basis for the regional burial rite (enclosed barrows, particular grave \ngoods, perhaps the vehicle burials themselves) and neither of these two \nindividuals are from primary barrow burials, nor did they have grave goods.  \n    Given that the \u03b415N value for WWH 14 is around 7.5\u2030 higher than the \naverage herbivores for the site, it is possible that this is a mobile individual \nfrom another location.  A diet including a large proportion of freshwater \naquatic resources might be considered, but this is unlikely given that access \nto local surface water at this site is restricted, the nearest source being 5 km \naway and the local streams being dry for much of the time, only flowing after \nheavy rainfall [5, 19].  This situation is thought to have been the case during \nlater prehistory in much the same way as it is today. \n    It must be borne in mind that this East Yorkshire cemetery was probably in \nuse for between 200 and 400 years [17], so that the analysed samples may \nnot have included many (or, indeed, any) of a small, original immigrant group. \n    The possibility that the individuals with unusual isotopic values were \nintrusive to the middle Iron Age phase of the site has been considered and \nrejected, now that direct AMS radiocarbon dates are available for these \nsamples (dates to be published elsewhere). \n \n5.2  Iron Age pigs and dogs \nThe herbivorous nature of the adult pigs is clear from the proximity of their \nvalues to those of the sheep in Figure 2.  It would appear that these animals \nwere not being fed human refuse in the form of animal-derived protein, but \nwere reliant on plant protein.  Of the five young pigs plotted separately, two \nare known to be less than or around 6 months old, one less than a year old \nand the other two generally described as immature [44].  These plot higher on \nthe nitrogen scale, as would be expected for unweaned or recently weaned \nanimals.  This is because such animals are one trophic level above their \nmothers, effectively \u2018carnivores\u2019 consuming milk produced by their mothers\u2019 \nbodies.  However, even at 6 months, these animals might be considered too \nold to continue reflecting this signal.  In that case it is possible that these \nyoung animals were being fed animal protein of some form after weaning, this \nbeing either dairy or meat, such dietary supplements perhaps ceasing if the \nanimal was allowed to live past a certain age.  Alternatively, since animals \nunder less intensive husbandry regimes may continue to suckle for longer \nperiods, it is possible that this was the case here (Dobney, pers. comm.). \n    Of the pigs analysed, 3 of the immature samples had been included as \ngrave goods in different burials.  Two of these animals were identified as \nbeing less than or around 6 months old [44].  There was a further Iron Age \nburial from Brewster\u2019s area of excavation which included two suckling pigs \n[10].  Their inclusion in the graves may indicate that young pig was an \nidentifiable part of the diet, given that there is a burial tradition in this area for \ngrave goods to include what are apparently food items (see above).  Unlike \nother domesticated animals, pigs are not generally useful for secondary \nproducts.  Reynolds has suggested that they can provide \u2018pig labour\u2019, by \nkeeping them in a field to be cultivated and allowing them to prepare and \nmanure the ground, obviating the necessity of using an ard [37].  However, \ntheir main utility is that they can convert less valuable food waste into meat \nand they may have been an obvious resource for preservation of supplies for \nperiods of shortage.  They produce high numbers of young and it is possible \nthat suckling pig was an attractive food option.  Bones of very young pigs \nfound at the Iron Age site of Staple Howe (East Yorkshire) were suggested as \nbeing indicative of the consumption of piglets [28], the charring of snout and \nlegs visible on the remains of the young pig from the 2001 vehicle burial \ndiscovery may be indicative of spit-roasting and the remains of very young \nanimals in the enclosure ditch may even be from the consumption of a \ncomplete litter (Mackey, pers. comm.).  If these, or other very young animals \n(e.g. young sheep) were regularly included in the diet, it would help to explain \nthe particularly high \u03b415N spacing between humans and herbivores seen at \nthis site. \n    The dogs plot high on the nitrogen scale and less negative on the carbon \nscale, indicating an omnivorous diet, with perhaps a lower proportion of \nanimal protein in their diets than the humans.  This suggestion is debatable, \nhowever, since experimental studies suggest that different species may \nexhibit varying levels of 15N enrichment over their diets [47, 48]. \n6.  Conclusions \nBone collagen \u03b413C and \u03b415N values for humans and animals from the middle \nIron Age at Wetwang and Garton Slack, East Yorkshire, show that the \nhumans had a diet over the period of use of the cemetery which did not \nchange significantly over time and which was substantially the same for all \nindividuals, regardless of sex, age or status.  This diet can be characterized \nas one which was high in animal protein and did not contain significant levels \nof marine foods.  Young pigs (or other young animals) may have made an \nimportant dietary contribution.  The tight range of values, particularly when \nconsidered across site phases, appears indicative of a local population rather \nthan one which contains adults who have been geographically mobile. \n    There are two human outliers in the data and there is an unusual trend in \nthe isotopic data from older males which requires further consideration. \n    The data presented here are the first for the British pre-Roman Iron Age, \nand this is one of the few isotope palaeodiet studies where the interpretation \nof human isotopic data is supported by a large number of contemporaneous \nanimal isotope values from the same site.  The relative uniformity of diets is \nparticularly interesting, especially in what is believed to be a complex and \nsocially stratified society where the differential provision of grave goods is \npresent, although there are many ethnographic examples of societies in which \ndifferent status groups share the same diet.  Further studies of Iron Age \nhumans from other sites in the UK and in continental Europe will help \ndetermine if this uniformity of diet is a local or more general Iron Age \nphenomenon. \nAcknowledgements \n    Part of this work has been funded by AHRB, with financial contributions \ntowards analytical costs also being made by CBA Yorkshire and the East \nRiding Archaeological Trust.

A limited number of \nspecimens have been identified by Mandy Jay in consultation with Julie Bond at the \nUniversity of Bradford. \n2  Skeletal element identification is mainly by Mandy Jay. \n3  Where \u201cR-B\u201d is shown, the bone is from a context which may be later than the Iron \nAge burials, either late Iron Age or Romano-British.  It is not expected that the data \nfor these animals will have been affected by any significant environmental \ndifferences over this time period. \n4  Where information is given relating to age, those marked with an asterisk (*) were \naged by Sally Scott.  Those unmarked in this way were noted as being young by \nMandy Jay on the basis of a combination of unfused epiphyses, obviously low level \ndental attrition and animal size. \nFigure 1 \nFigure 2 \n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\n9.0\n10.0\n11.0\n-22.5 -22.0 -21.5 -21.0 -20.5 -20.0\nPigs \n\u03b413C (\u2030) \n\u03b415\nN\n (\u2030\n) \nYoung \npigs \nHumans \nDogs \nAnalytical \nprecision \nSheep \n \nFigure 3 \n8.0\n8.5\n9.0\n9.5\n10.0\n10.5\n11.0\n11.5\n12.0\n12.5\n-21.5 -21.0 -20.5 -20.0 -19.5\n'Chariot' burials\nBarrows + grave goods\nBarrows, no grave goods\nGrave goods, no barrow\nNo barrow, no grave goods\nFrom animal bone context\n\u03b415\nN\n (\u2030\n) \n\u03b413C (\u2030) \nAnalytical \nprecision \nWWH 14 \nWWH 431 \nFigure 4 \nR2 = 0.6033\n8.5\n9.0\n9.5\n10.0\n10.5\n11.0\n-21.2 -21.0 -20.8 -20.6 -20.4 -20.2 -20.0\n\u03b413C (\u2030) \n\u03b415\nN\n (\u2030\n) \nFigure 5 \n8.0\n8.5\n9.0\n9.5\n10.0\n10.5\n11.0\n-21.5 -21.0 -20.5 -20.0 -19.5\nEarly phase Late phase\n\u03b413C (\u2030) \n\u03b415\nN\n (\u2030\n) \nFig. 1.
