We consider the following question :\ngiven G, how easily can we decide whether or not C3(G) is connected? We show that\nthe 3-colour graph of a 3-chromatic graph is never connected, and characterise the bi-\npartite graphs for which C3(G) is connected. We also show that the problem of deciding\nthe connectedness of the 3-colour graph of a bipartite graph is coNP-complete, but that\nrestricted to planar bipartite graphs, the question is answerable in polynomial time.\n1 Introduction\nThroughout this paper a graph G = (V,E) is simple, loopless and finite. Most of our ter-\nminology and notation is standard and can be found in any textbook on graph theory such\nas, for example, [3]. We always regard a k-colouring of a graph G as proper; that is, as a\nfunction \u03b1 : V \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , k} such that \u03b1(u) 6= \u03b1(v) for any uv \u2208 E. For a positive integer k\nand a graph G, we define the k-colour graph of G, denoted Ck(G), as the graph that has the\nk-colourings of G as its node set, with two k-colourings joined by an edge in Ck(G) if they\ndiffer in colour on just one vertex of G.\nContinuing a theme begun in an earlier paper [2], we investigate the connectedness of Ck(G)\nfor a given G, this time concentrating on the case k = 3. The connectedness of the k-colour\ngraph is an issue of interest when trying to obtain efficient algorithms for almost uniform\n\u2020 Research partially supported by Nuffield grant no. NAL\/32772.\n1\nsampling of k-colourings of a given graph. In particular, Ck(G) needs to be connected for the\nsingle-site Glauber dynamics of G ( a Markov chain defined on the k-colour graph of G ) to\nbe rapidly mixing. For further details, see, for example, [5, 6] and references therein.\nWe outline some of our terminology and notation. We use \u03b1, \u03b2, . . . to denote specific\ncolourings. We say thatG is k-mixing if Ck(G) is connected, and, having defined the colourings\nas nodes of Ck(G), the meaning of, for example, the path between two colourings should be\nclear. Observe that a graph G is k-mixing if and only if every connected component of G\nis k-mixing, so we will usually take our \u201cargument graph\u201d G to be connected. We assume\nthroughout that k \u2265 \u03c7(G) \u2265 2, where \u03c7(G) is the chromatic number of G. We use the term\nfrozen for a k-colouring of a graph G that forms an isolated node in the k-colour graph. Note\nthat the existence of a frozen k-colouring of a graph immediately implies that the graph is\nnot k-mixing.\nIf G has a k-colouring \u03b1, then we say that we can recolour G with \u03b2 if \u03b1\u03b2 is an edge\nof Ck(G). If v is the unique vertex on which \u03b1 and \u03b2 differ, then we also say that we can\nrecolour v.\nWe denote the cycle on n vertices by Cn, and will often describe a colouring of Cn by just\nlisting the colours as they appear on consecutive vertices.\nThe remainder of this paper is set out as follows. In the following section we introduce\nsome of our tools and methods, revisiting the proof ( given in [2] ) that 3-chromatic graphs are\nnot 3-mixing. Section 3 gives two equivalent characterisations of 3-mixing bipartite graphs.\nIn Section 4 we consider the problem of deciding whether a given bipartite graph is 3-mixing :\nwe show that this problem is coNP-complete. In the final section, we describe an algorithm\nthat answers the question for bipartite planar graphs in polynomial time.\n2 Preliminaries\nIn [2] it was shown that if G has chromatic number k for k = 2, 3, then G is not k-mixing,\nbut that, on the other hand, for k \u2265 4, there are k-chromatic graphs that are k-mixing and\nk-chromatic graphs that are not k-mixing. For completeness, and since several of the ideas\nare used in later parts of this paper, we include a proof of the fact that 3-chromatic graphs\nare not 3-mixing. Let us first give some definitions.\nGiven a 3-colouring \u03b1, the weight of an edge e = uv oriented from u to v is\nw(\u2212\u2192uv, \u03b1) =\n{\n+1, if \u03b1(u)\u03b1(v) \u2208 {12, 23, 31};\n\u22121, if \u03b1(u)\u03b1(v) \u2208 {21, 32, 13}. (1)\nTo orient a cycle means to orient each edge on the cycle so that a directed cycle is obtained.\nIf C is a cycle, then by\n\u2212\u2192\nC we denote the cycle with one of the two possible orientations. The\nweight W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) of an oriented cycle\n\u2212\u2192\nC is the sum of the weights of its oriented edges.\nLemma 1 Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 be 3-colourings of a graph G that contains a cycle C. Then if \u03b1\nand \u03b2 are in the same component of C3(G), we must have W (\u2212\u2192C ,\u03b1) =W (\u2212\u2192C , \u03b2).\nProof : Let \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 be 3-colourings of G that are adjacent in C3(G), and suppose the two\n3-colourings differ on vertex v. If v is not on C, then we certainly haveW (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) =W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1\u2032).\n2\nIf v is a vertex of C, then its two neighbours on C must have the same colour in \u03b1, else we\nwouldn\u2019t be able to recolour v. If we denote the in-neighbour of v on\n\u2212\u2192\nC by vi and its out-\nneighbour by vo, then w(\u2212\u2192viv, \u03b1) and w(\u2212\u2192vvo, \u03b1) have opposite sign, and w(\u2212\u2192viv, \u03b1)+w(\u2212\u2192vvo, \u03b1) =\n0.\nRecolouring vertex v will change the signs of the weights of the oriented edges \u2212\u2192viv and \u2212\u2192vvo,\nbut they will remain opposite. Therefore w(\u2212\u2192viv, \u03b1\u2032) + w(\u2212\u2192vvo, \u03b1\u2032) = 0, and W (\u2212\u2192C ,\u03b1) =\nW (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1\u2032). From this we immediately obtain that the weight of an oriented cycle is con-\nstant on all 3-colourings in the same component of C3(G). 2\nNote that the converse of Lemma 1 is not true. For instance the 3-cycle has six 3-colourings.\nOf these, 1-2-3, 2-3-1 and 3-1-2 give the same weight of the oriented 3-cycle, but they are not\nconnected \u2014 in fact, they are all frozen.\nLemma 2 Let \u03b1 be a 3-colouring of a graph G that contains a cycle C. If W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0,\nthen C3(G) is not connected.\nProof : Let \u03b2 be the 3-colouring of G obtained by setting for each vertex v of G :\n\u03b2(v) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1, if \u03b1(v) = 2;\n2, if \u03b1(v) = 1;\n3, if \u03b1(v) = 3.\nIt is easy to check that for each edge e in C, w(~e, \u03b1) = \u2212w(~e, \u03b2), which gives W (\u2212\u2192C ,\u03b1) =\n\u2212W (\u2212\u2192C , \u03b2). Since W (\u2212\u2192C ,\u03b1) 6= 0, we must have W (\u2212\u2192C ,\u03b1) 6=W (\u2212\u2192C , \u03b2), and so, by Lemma 1, \u03b1\nand \u03b2 belong to different components of C3(G). 2\nTheorem 3 Let G be a 3-chromatic graph. Then G is not 3-mixing.\nProof : As G has chromatic number 3, it contains a cycle C of odd length. Let \u03b1 be a\n3-colouring of G, and note that as the weight of each edge in\n\u2212\u2192\nC is +1 or \u22121, W (\u2212\u2192C ,\u03b1) 6= 0.\nWe are done by Lemma 2. 2\n3 Characterising 3-mixing bipartite graphs\nWe have seen that 3-chromatic graphs are not 3-mixing. What can be said for bipartite\ngraphs? Examples of 3-mixing bipartite graphs include trees and C4, the cycle on 4 vertices.\nOn the other hand, all cycles except C4 are not 3-mixing \u2014 see [2] for details. In Theorem 4\nwe distinguish between 3-mixing and non-3-mixing bipartite graphs in terms of their structure\nand the possible 3-colourings they may have.\nIf v and w are vertices of a bipartite graph G at distance two, then a pinch on v and w is\nthe identification of v and w ( together with the removal of any double edges produced ). We\nsay that G is pinchable to a graph H if there exists a sequence of pinches that transforms G\ninto H.\n3\nTheorem 4 Let G be a connected bipartite graph. The following are equivalent :\n(i) The graph G is not 3-mixing.\n(ii) There exists a cycle C in G and a 3-colouring \u03b1 of G with W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0.\n(iii) The graph G is pinchable to the 6-cycle C6.\nTo prove Theorem 4, we need some definitions and technical lemmas. For the rest of this\nsection, let G = (V,E) denote a connected bipartite graph with vertex bipartition X,Y .\nGiven a 3-colouring \u03b1 of G, we define a height function for \u03b1 with base X as a function\nh : V \u2192 Z satisfying the following conditions. ( See [1, 4] for other, similar height functions. )\nH1 For all v \u2208 X, h(v) \u2261 0 (mod 2); for all v \u2208 Y , h(v) \u2261 1 (mod 2).\nH2 For all uv \u2208 E, h(v)\u2212 h(u) = w(\u2212\u2192uv, \u03b1) ( \u2208 {\u22121,+1} ).\nH3 For all v \u2208 V , h(v) \u2261 \u03b1(v) (mod 3).\nIf h : V \u2192 Z satisfies conditions H2, H3 and also\nH1\u2032 For all v \u2208 X, h(v) \u2261 1 (mod 2); while for v \u2208 Y , h(v) \u2261 0 (mod 2).\nthen h is said to be a height function for \u03b1 with base Y .\nObserve that for a particular colouring of a given G, a height function might not exist.\nAn example of this is the 6-cycle C6 coloured 1-2-3-1-2-3.\nConversely, however, a function h : V \u2192 Z satisfying conditions H1 and H2 induces a\n3-colouring of G : the unique \u03b1 : V \u2192 {1, 2, 3} satisfying condition H3, and h is in fact a\nheight function for this \u03b1. Observe also that if h is a height function for \u03b1 with base X,\nthen so are h + 6 and h \u2212 6; while h + 3 and h \u2212 3 are height functions for \u03b1 with base Y .\nBecause we will be concerned solely with the question of existence of height functions, we\nassume henceforth that for a given G, all height functions have base X. Thus we let HX(G)\nbe the set of height functions with base X corresponding to some 3-colouring of G, and define\na metric m on HX(G) by setting\nm(h1, h2) =\n\u2211\nv\u2208V\n|h1(v)\u2212 h2(v)|,\nfor h1, h2 \u2208 HX(G). Note that condition H1 above implies that m(h1, h2) is always even.\nFor a given height function h, h(v) is said to be a local maximum ( respectively, local\nminimum ) if h(v) is larger than ( respectively, smaller than ) h(u) for all neighbours u of v.\nFollowing [4], we define the following height transformations on h.\n\u2013 An increasing height transformation takes a local minimum h(v) of h and transforms h\ninto the height function h\u2032 given by h\u2032(x) =\n{\nh(x) + 2, if x = v;\nh(x), if x 6= v.\n\u2013 A decreasing height transformation takes a local maximum h(v) of h and transforms h\ninto the height function h\u2032 given by h\u2032(x) =\n{\nh(x)\u2212 2, if x = v;\nh(x), if x 6= v.\nNotice that these height transformations give rise to transformations between the corre-\nsponding colourings. Specifically, if we let \u03b1\u2032 be the 3-colouring corresponding to h\u2032, an\nincreasing transformation yields \u03b1\u2032(v) = \u03b1(v) \u2212 1, while a decreasing transformation yields\n\u03b1\u2032(v) = \u03b1(v) + 1, where addition is modulo 3.\n4\nThe following lemma, a simple extension of the range of applicability of a similar lemma\nappearing in [4], shows that colourings with height functions are connected in C3(G).\nLemma 5 ([4]) Let \u03b1, \u03b2 be two 3-colourings of G with corresponding height functions h\u03b1, h\u03b2.\nThen there is a path between \u03b1 and \u03b2 in C3(G).\nProof : We use induction on m(h\u03b1, h\u03b2). The lemma is trivially true when m(h\u03b1, h\u03b2) = 0,\nsince in this case \u03b1 and \u03b2 are identical.\nSuppose therefore that m(h\u03b1, h\u03b2) > 0. We show that there is a height transformation\ntransforming h\u03b1 into some height function h with m(h, h\u03b2) = m(h\u03b1, h\u03b2)\u2212 2, from which the\nlemma follows.\nWithout loss of generality, let us assume that there is some vertex v \u2208 V with h\u03b1(v) >\nh\u03b2(v), and let us choose v with h\u03b1(v) as large as possible. We show that such a v must be\na local maximum of h\u03b1. Let u be any neighbour of v. If h\u03b1(u) > h\u03b2(u), then it follows that\nh\u03b1(v) > h\u03b1(u), since v was chosen with h\u03b1(v) maximum, and |h\u03b1(v)\u2212 h\u03b1(u)| = 1. If, on the\nother hand, h\u03b1(u) \u2264 h\u03b2(u), we have h\u03b1(v) \u2265 h\u03b2(v)+1 \u2265 h\u03b2(u) \u2265 h\u03b1(u), which in fact means\nh\u03b1(v) > h\u03b1(u).\nThus h\u03b1(v) > h\u03b1(u) for all neighbours u of v, and we can apply a decreasing height\ntransformation to h\u03b1 at v to obtain h. Clearly m(h, h\u03b2) = m(h\u03b1, h\u03b2)\u2212 2. 2\nThe next lemma tells us that for a given 3-colouring, non-zero weight cycles are, in some sense,\nthe obstructing configurations forbidding the existence of a corresponding height function.\nLemma 6 Let \u03b1 be a 3-colouring of G with no corresponding height function. Then G con-\ntains a cycle C for which W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0.\nProof : For a path P in G, let\n\u2212\u2192\nP denote one of the two possible directed paths obtainable\nfrom P , and let\nW (\n\u2212\u2192\nP , \u03b1) =\n\u2211\n~e\u2208E(\u2212\u2192P )\nw(~e, \u03b1),\nwhere w(~e, \u03b1) takes values as defined in (1).\nNotice that if a colouring does have a height function, it is possible to construct one by\nfixing a vertex x \u2208 X, giving x an appropriate height ( satisfying properties H1\u2013H3 ) and then\nassigning heights to all vertices in V by following a breadth-first ordering from x.\nWhenever we attempt to construct a height function h for \u03b1 in such a fashion, we must\ncome to a stage in the ordering where we attempt to give some vertex v a height h(v) and\nfind ourselves unable to because v has a neighbour u with a previously assigned height h(u)\nand |h(u) \u2212 h(v)| > 1. Letting P be a path between u and v formed by vertices that have\nbeen assigned a height, and choosing the appropriate orientation of P , we have w(\n\u2212\u2192\nP , \u03b1) =\n|h(u)\u2212h(v)|. The lemma now follows by letting C be the cycle formed by P and the edge uv. 2\nThe following lemma is obvious.\n5\nLemma 7 Let u and v be vertices on a cycle C in a graph G, and suppose there is a path P\nbetween u and v in G internally disjoint from C. Let \u03b1 be a 3-colouring of G. Let C \u2032 and C \u2032\u2032\nbe the two cycles formed from P and edges of C, and let\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032,\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032\u2032 be the orientations of C \u2032, C \u2032\u2032\ninduced by an orientation\n\u2212\u2192\nC of C ( so the edges of P have opposite orientations in\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032 and\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032\u2032 ).\nThen W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) =W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032, \u03b1) +W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032\u2032, \u03b1).\nNote this tells us that W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0 implies W (\u2212\u2192C \u2032, \u03b1) 6= 0 or W (\u2212\u2192C \u2032\u2032, \u03b1) 6= 0.\nProof of Theorem 4 : Let G be a connected bipartite graph.\n(i) =\u21d2 (ii). Suppose C3(G) is not connected. Take two 3-colourings of G, \u03b1 and \u03b2, in\ndifferent components of C3(G). By Lemma 5 we know at least one of them, say \u03b1, has no\ncorresponding height function, and, by Lemma 6, there is a cycle C in G with W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0.\n(ii) =\u21d2 (iii). Let G contain a cycle C with W (\u2212\u2192C ,\u03b1) 6= 0 for some 3-colouring \u03b1 of G.\nBecause W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC4, \u03b2) = 0 for any 3-colouring \u03b2 of C4, it follows that C = Cn for some even\nn \u2265 6. If G = C, then it is easy to find a sequence of pinches that will yield C6. If G is C plus\nsome chords, then Lemma 7 tells us that there is a smaller cycle C \u2032 with W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032, \u03b1) 6= 0. Thus\nif G 6= C, we can assume that V (G) 6= V (C), and we describe how to pinch a pair of vertices\nso that (ii) remains satisfied ( for a specified cycle with G replaced by the graph created by\nthe pinch and \u03b1 replaced by its restriction to that graph; also denoted \u03b1 ); by repetition,\nwe can obtain a graph that is a cycle and, by the previous observations, the implication is\nproved.\nNote that we shall choose vertices coloured alike to pinch so that the restriction of \u03b1 to\nthe graph obtained is well-defined and proper. If C has three consecutive vertices u, v, w\nwith \u03b1(u) = \u03b1(w), pinching u and w yields a graph containing a cycle C \u2032 = Cn\u22122 with\nW (\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032, \u03b1) = W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1). Otherwise C is coloured 1-2-3-\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 -1-2-3. We can choose u, v, w to be\nthree consecutive vertices of C, such that there is a vertex x \/\u2208 V (C) adjacent to v. Suppose,\nwithout loss of generality, that \u03b1(x) = \u03b1(u), and pinch x and u to obtain a graph in which\nW (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) is unchanged.\n(iii) =\u21d2 (i). Suppose G is pinchable to C6. Take two 3-colourings of C6 not connected\nby a path in C3(C6) \u2014 1-2-3-1-2-3 and 1-2-1-2-1-2, for example. Considering the appropriate\norientation of C6, note that the first colouring has weight 6 and the second has weight 0. We\nconstruct two 3-colourings of G not connected by a path in C3(G) as follows. Consider the\nreverse sequence of pinches that gives G from C6. Following this sequence, for each colouring\nof C6, give every pair of new vertices introduced by an \u201cunpinching\u201d the same colour as\nthe vertex from which they originated. In this manner we obtain two 3-colourings of G, \u03b1\nand \u03b2, say. Observe that every unpinching maintains a cycle in G which has weight 6 with\nrespect to the colouring induced by the first colouring of C6 and weight 0 with respect to the\nsecond induced colouring. This means G will contain a cycle C for which W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) = 6 and\nW (\n\u2212\u2192\nC , \u03b2) = 0, showing that \u03b1 and \u03b2 cannot possibly be in the same connected component\nof C3(G).\nThis completes the proof of the theorem. 2\n6\n4 The complexity of 3-mixing for bipartite graphs\nLet us now turn our attention to the computational complexity of deciding whether or not a\n3-colourable graph G is 3-mixing. From Theorem 3 we know that we can restrict our attention\nto bipartite graphs, so we state the decision problem formally as follows.\n3-Mixing\nInstance : A connected bipartite graph G.\nQuestion : Is G 3-mixing?\nObserving that Theorem 4 gives us two polynomial-time verifiable certificates for when G is\nnot 3-mixing, we immediately obtain that 3-Mixing is in the complexity class coNP. By the\nsame theorem, the following decision problem is the complement of 3-Mixing.\nPinchable-to-C6\nInstance : A connected bipartite graph G.\nQuestion : Is G pinchable to C6?\nWe will prove the following result.\nTheorem 8 The decision problem 3-Mixing is coNP-complete.\nOur proof will in fact show that Pinchable-to-C6 is NP-complete. We will obtain a reduc-\ntion from the following decision problem.\nRetractable-to-C6\nInstance : A connected bipartite graph G with an induced 6-cycle S.\nQuestion : Is G retractable to S? That is, does there exist a homomorphism r : V (G)\u2192 V (S)\nsuch that r(v) = v for all v \u2208 V (S)?\nIn [7] is is mentioned, without references, that Toma\u00b4s Feder and Gary MacGillivray proved in-\ndependently thatRetractable-to-C6 is NP-complete by reduction from 3-Colourability.\nFor completeness we give a sketch of a proof.\nTheorem 9 (Feder, MacGillivray, see [7]) Retractable-to-C6 is NP-complete.\nSketch of proof : It is clear that Retractable-to-C6 is in NP.\nGiven a graph G, construct a new graph G\u2032 as follows : subdivide every edge uv of G by\ninserting a vertex yuv between u and v. Also add new vertices a, b, c, d, e together with edges\nza, ab, bc, cd, de, ez, where z is a particular vertex of G ( any one will do ). The graph G\u2032 is\nclearly connected and bipartite, and the vertices z, a, b, c, d, e induce a 6-cycle S. We will\nprove that G is 3-colourable if and only if G\u2032 retracts to the induced 6-cycle S.\nAssume that G is 3-colourable and take a 3-colouring \u03c4 of G with \u03c4(z) = 1. From \u03c4\nwe construct a 6-colouring \u03c3 of G\u2032. For this, first set \u03c3(x) = \u03c4(x), if x \u2208 V (G). For the\nnew vertices yuv set \u03c3(yuv) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\n4, if \u03c4(u) = 1 and \u03c4(v) = 2,\n5, if \u03c4(u) = 2 and \u03c4(v) = 3,\n6, if \u03c4(u) = 3 and \u03c4(v) = 1.\nAnd for the cycle S we take\n7\n\u03c3(a) = 4, \u03c3(b) = 2, \u03c3(c) = 5, \u03c3(d) = 3 and \u03c3(e) = 6. Now define r : V (G\u2032)\u2192 V (S) by setting\nr(x) = z, if \u03c3(x) = 1; r(x) = a, if \u03c3(x) = 4; r(x) = b, if \u03c3(x) = 2; r(x) = c, if \u03c3(x) = 5;\nr(x) = d, if \u03c3(x) = 3; and r(x) = e, if \u03c3(x) = 6. It is easy to check that r is a retraction of G\u2032\nto S.\nConversely, suppose G\u2032 retracts to S. We can use this retraction to define a 6-colouring\nof G\u2032 in a similar way to that in which we defined r from \u03c3 in the preceeding paragraph. The\nrestriction of this 6-colouring to G yields a 3-colouring of G, completing the proof. 2\nOur proof of Theorem 8 follows [7], where, as a special case of the main result of that paper,\nthe following problem is proved to be NP-complete.\nCompactable-to-C6\nInstance : A connected bipartite graph G.\nQuestion : Is G compactable to C6? That is, does there exist an edge-surjective homomor-\nphism c : V (G)\u2192 V (C6)?\nIn [7] a polynomial reduction from Retractable-to-Ck to Compactable-to-Ck, with\nk \u2265 6 even, is given. We will use exactly the same transformation for k = 6 to prove that\nPinchable-to-C6 is NP-complete.\nProof of Theorem 8 : As mentioned before, we will show that 3-Mixing is coNP-complete\nby showing that Pinchable-to-C6 is NP-complete. And we do that by giving a polynomial\nreduction from Retractable-to-C6 to Pinchable-to-C6.\nSo consider an instance of Retractable-to-C6 : a connected bipartite graph G and an\ninduced 6-cycle S. From G we construct, in time polynomial in the size of G, an instance G\u2032\nof Pinchable-to-C6 such that\nG retracts to S if and only if G\u2032 is pinchable to C6. (\u2217)\nAssume G has vertex bipartition (GA, GB). Let V (S) = SA \u222a SB, where SA = {h0, h2, h4}\nand SB = {h1, h3, h5}, and assume E(S) = {h0h1, . . . , h4h5, h5h0 }.\nThe construction of G\u2032 is as follows.\n\u2022 For every vertex a \u2208 GA \\SA, add to G new vertices ua1, ua2, wa1 , ya1 , ya2 , together with edges\nua1h0, au\na\n2, w\na\n1h3, aw\na\n1 , u\na\n1w\na\n1 , y\na\n1h5, y\na\n2h2, u\na\n1y\na\n1 , w\na\n1y\na\n2 , u\na\n1u\na\n2, y\na\n1y\na\n2 .\n\u2022 For every vertex b \u2208 GB \\SB, add to G new vertices ub1, wb1, wb2, yb1, yb2, together with edges\nub1h0, bu\nb\n1, w\nb\n1h3, bw\nb\n2, u\nb\n1w\nb\n1, y\nb\n1h5, y\nb\n2h2, u\nb\n1y\nb\n1, w\nb\n1y\nb\n2, w\nb\n1w\nb\n2, y\nb\n1y\nb\n2.\n\u2022 For every edge ab \u2208 E(G) \\ E(S), with a \u2208 GA \\ SA and b \u2208 GB \\ SB, add two new\nvertices : xaba adjacent to a and u\na\n1; and x\nab\nb adjacent to b, w\nb\n1 and x\nab\na .\nFrom the construction it is clear that G\u2032 is connected and bipartite.

Then G is pinchable to C6.\nProof : The fact that G retracts to S means we have a homomorphism r : V (G)\u2192 V (S) such\nthat r(v) = v for all v \u2208 V (S). Define a partition {Ri | i = 0, 1, . . . , 5 } of V (G) by setting\nv \u2208 Ri \u21d0\u21d2 r(v) = hi. Because r is a homomorphism, we know any edge e \u2208 E(G) has one\nvertex in Rj and another in Rj+1, for some j, where subscript addition is modulo 6. Using this\npartition of V (G), we show that G is pinchable to a 6-cycle \u2014 to S, in fact. We describe how\nto pinch a pair of vertices such that the resulting ( smaller ) graph still has S as an induced\nsubgraph; by repetition, this will eventually yield S. Supposing V (G) 6= V (S) ( for else we\nare done ), let E\u2212 = E(G) \\ E(S). Because G is connected, there must be an edge uv \u2208 E\u2212\nwith u \u2208 V (S) and v \u2208 V (G) \\ V (S). Suppose v \u2208 Rj , for some j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , 5}. Pinch v\nwith hj , and note that the resulting graph remains bipartite, connected and contains S as an\ninduced subgraph. Denote the resulting graph by G and repeat. 2\nWe now prove the \u2018only if\u2019 part of (\u2217).\nClaim 2 Suppose G retracts to S. Then G\u2032 is pinchable to C6.\n9\nProof : By Claim 1, G is pinchable to C6. In fact, by the proof of Claim 1, we know G is\npinchable to S. Because G is an induced subgraph of G\u2032, we can follow, in G\u2032, the sequence of\npinches that gives S from G. We now show how, after following this sequence of pinches, we\ncan choose some further pinches that will leave us with S. For a vertex v \u2208 V (G) \\ V (S), we\nwill pinch into S all vertices introduced to G\u2032 on account of v, yielding a smaller graph still\ncontaining S as an induced subgraph. By repetition, we will eventually end up with just S.\nFirst let us consider where a vertex a \u2208 GA \\ SA with no neighbours in GB \\ SB might\nhave been pinched to, and how we could continue pinching. There are three possibilities.\n1. The vertex a has been pinched with h1. In that case pinch ya1 with h0, y\na\n2 with h1, u\na\n1\nwith h1, ua2 with h0, and w\na\n1 with h2.\n2. The vertex a has been pinched with h3. In that case pinch ya1 with h4, y\na\n2 with h3, u\na\n1\nwith h5, ua2 with h4, and w\na\n1 with h4.\n3. The vertex a has been pinched with h5. In that case pinch ya1 with h4, y\na\n2 with h3, u\na\n1\nwith h5, ua2 with h0, and w\na\n1 with h4.\nSimilarly, let us consider where a vertex b \u2208 GB\\SB with no neighbours in GA\\SA might have\nbeen pinched to, and how we could continue pinching. Again, there are three possibilities.\n1. The vertex b has been pinched with h0. In that case pinch yb1 with h0, y\nb\n2 with h1, u\nb\n1\nwith h1, wb1 with h2, and w\nb\n2 with h1.\n2. The vertex b has been pinched with h2. In that case pinch yb1 with h0, y\nb\n2 with h1, u\nb\n1\nwith h1, wb1 with h2, and w\nb\n2 with h3.\n3. The vertex b has been pinched with h4. In that case pinch yb1 with h4, y\nb\n2 with h3, u\nb\n1\nwith h5, wb1 with h4, and w\nb\n2 with h3.\nNow let us consider the case where a vertex a \u2208 GA \\SA is adjacent to a vertex b \u2208 GB \\SB.\nThere are six cases to consider, corresponding to the six edges of S to which ab might have\nbeen pinched. Often there will be a choice of pinches \u2014 for each case we give just one.\n1. The edge ab has been pinched to h1h2. We can use the previous case analyses to conclude\nthat ua1 must be pinched with h1 and w\nb\n1 with h2. Now we must deal with x\nab\na and x\nab\nb .\nPinching xaba with h2 and x\nab\nb with h1 gives us what we require.\n2. The edge ab has been pinched to h1h0. Then we conclude ua1 must be pinched with h1\nand wb1 with h2. Now pinch x\nab\na with h0 and x\nab\nb with h1.\n3. The edge ab has been pinched to h3h4. Then ua1 must be pinched with h5 and w\nb\n1 with h4.\nNow pinch xaba with h4 and x\nab\nb with h3.\n4. The edge ab has been pinched to h3h2. Then ua1 must be pinched with h5 and w\nb\n1 with h2.\nNow pinch xaba with h4 and x\nab\nb with h3.\n5. The edge ab has been pinched to h5h0. Then ua1 must be pinched with h5 and w\nb\n1 with h2.\nNow pinch xaba with h0 and x\nab\nb with h1.\n6. The edge ab has been pinched to h5h4. Then ua1 must be pinched with h5 and w\nb\n1 with h4.\nNow pinch xaba with h4 and x\nab\nb with h5.\nThis completes the proof of the claim. 2\nWe must now prove the \u2018if\u2019 part of (\u2217) \u2014 we do this via the next three claims.\n10\nClaim 3 Suppose G\u2032 is pinchable to C6. Then G\u2032 is compactable to C6.\nProof : The fact that G\u2032 is pinchable to the 6-cycle C6 = k0k1k2k3k4k5k0 means there exists\na homomorphism c : V (G\u2032)\u2192 V (C6). In order to make this precise, let us define sets Pi, for\ni = 0, 1, . . . , 5, as follows. Initially, set Pi = {ki}. Now let us consider the reverse sequence\nof \u201cunpinchings\u201d that yields G\u2032 from C6. Following this sequence, suppose a vertex v \u2208 Pj\nis unpinched. Delete v from Pj and add to Pj the two vertices that were identified to give v\nin the original pinch. Repeat this until G\u2032 is obtained, and now define c by setting, for\nv \u2208 V (G\u2032), c(v) = ki \u21d0\u21d2 v \u2208 Pi. Clearly the sets Pi form a partition of V (G\u2032) and so c\nis well-defined. In addition, by the way the sets Pi have been constructed, it is clear that\nany edge uv \u2208 E(G\u2032) has one vertex in Pj and the other in Pj+1, for some j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , 5}.\nThis means c(u)c(v) \u2208 E(C6) and so c is a homomorphism. Moreover, it is edge-surjective :\nthe Pi\u2019s are all non-empty and there is at least one edge between every pair Pi, Pi+1. 2\nThe proof of the following claim is similar to the proof in [7], where it is shown that if G\u2032 is\ncompactable to C6, then G\u2032 retracts to S.\nWe need some further notation. As usual, for a set S and a function f , we let f(S) =\n{ f(s) | s \u2208 S }. For vertices u, v in a graph H, dH(u, v) denotes the distance between u\nand v; and for a vertex u and a set of vertices S we have dH(S, u) = min{ dH(v, u) | v \u2208 S }.\nClaim 4 Suppose G\u2032 is pinchable to C6. Then G\u2032 retracts to S.\nProof : By Claim 3 we know there exists a compaction c : V (G\u2032) \u2192 V (C6). We prove c\nis in fact a retraction to S. To do this, we must show that for all v \u2208 V (S), c(v) = v.\nFor convenience, we now use the same notation for C6 and S; that is, we let V (C6) =\n{h0, h1, . . . , h5} and E(C6) = {h0h1, . . . , h4h5, h5h0 }.\nLet U = {uv1 | v \u2208 V (G) \\ V (S) } \u222a {h0, h1, h5} and W = {wv1 | v \u2208 V (G) \\ V (S) } \u222a\n{h2, h3, h4}. Because both these vertex sets induce subgraphs of diameter 2 in G\u2032, c(U)\nand c(W ) must each induce a path of length 1 or 2 in C6. We prove they each induce a path\nof length 2.\nSuppose that c(U) has only two vertices, adjacent in C6. Thus we let c(U) = {h0, h1},\nwith c(h0) = h0. ( Due to the symmetry of C6, we can, if necessary, redefine c in this way. )\nLet U\u2212 = U \\{h0}. Because h0 is adjacent to every other vertex in U , c(U\u2212) = {h1}. It is easy\nto check that for any g \u2208 G\u2032, dG\u2032(U\u2212, g) \u2264 2. But we have dC6(c(U\u2212), h4) = dC6(h1, h4) = 3,\nwhich means no g \u2208 G\u2032 can be mapped to h4 under c, contradicting the fact that c is a\ncompaction.\nHence c(U) induces a path on three vertices. By a similar argument, the same applies\nto c(W ). By the symmetry of C6, we can without loss of generality take c(U) = {h1, h0, h5}.\nThis means that c(h0) = h0. We now prove that c(h3) = h3.\nLet gg\u2032 be an edge of G\u2032 that is mapped to h3h2 or h3h4, with c(g) = h3, and c(g\u2032) =\nh2 or c(g\u2032) = h4. Note that h3 is at distance 2 from c(U) in C6 while h2 and h4 are at\ndistance 1 from c(U) in C6. This means that dG\u2032(U, g) \u2265 2 and dG\u2032(U, g\u2032) \u2265 1. Earlier we\nnoted that the distance between U\u2212 and any vertex of G\u2032 is at most 2, which means that\ndG\u2032(U, g) \u2264 2, so in fact dG\u2032(U, g) = 2. Because G\u2032 is bipartite, dG\u2032(U, g\u2032) = 1. Hence g is one\n11\nof a, xabb , h3, y\na\n2 , y\nb\n2, w\nb\n2, and g\n\u2032 is one of b, xaba , ua2, h2, h4, ya1 , yb1, wa1 , wb1, for some a \u2208 GA \\ SA,\nb \u2208 GB \\ SB. Given that c(h0) = h0, we cannot have c(h3) = h2 or c(h3) = h4. Aiming\nfor a contradiction, let us suppose that c(h3) 6= h3. Then no edge of G\u2032 with h3 as an\nendpoint covers h3h2 or h3h4. Hence gg\u2032 must be one of the following : axaba , ab, aua2, awa1 ,\nxabb x\nab\na , x\nab\nb b, x\nab\nb w\nb\n1, y\na\n2y\na\n1 , y\na\n2w\na\n1 , y\na\n2h2, y\nb\n2y\nb\n1, y\nb\n2w\nb\n1, y\nb\n2h2 , w\nb\n2w\nb\n1, w\nb\n2b. If ah2 or ah4 is an edge\nof G\u2032, then we also need to consider such an edge as a possible candidate for gg\u2032. By previous\nassumptions, we have c(h3) = h1 or c(h3) = h5. We now prove that c(h3) 6= h3 is impossible\nas follows. We first assume c(h3) = h1 and show that no possible edge for gg\u2032 covers h3h4,\nand then assume c(h3) = h5 and show that no possible edge for gg\u2032 covers h3h2. Thus let us\nassume c(h3) = h1.\nLet us suppose that for some v \u2208 V (G) \\ V (S), yv2wv1 covers h3h4, so c(yv2) = h3 and\nc(wv1) = h4. But c(h3) = h1, and since h3 an w\nv\n1 are adjacent, we must have c(w\nv\n1) = h0 or\nc(wv1) = h2, a contradiction.\nBy exactly the same argument, we come to the conclusion that none of the edges awa1 ,\nwb2w\nb\n1, x\nab\nb w\nb\n1 can cover the edge h3h4. A similar argument applies to y\nv\n2h2.\nSuppose that for some v \u2208 V (G) \\ V (S), yv2yv1 covers h3h4, so c(yv2) = h3 and c(yv1) = h4.\nNow c(uv1) = h1 or c(u\nv\n1) = h5, but since u\nv\n1 and y\nv\n1 are adjacent we must have c(u\nv\n1) = h5.\nBecause c(wv1) must be adjacent to c(y\nv\n2) = h3, c(w\nv\n1) = h2 or c(w\nv\n1) = h4. But u\nv\n1 is adjacent\nto wv1 , so c(w\nv\n1) = h4. This means y\nv\n2w\nv\n1 covers h3h4, which we have already seen is impossible.\nNow suppose that for some b \u2208 GB \\ SB, wb2b covers h3h4, so c(wb2) = h3 and c(b) = h4.\nIf c(b) = h4, we must have c(ub1) = h3 or c(u\nb\n1) = h5. But c(h0) = h0 means c(u\nb\n1) = h1 or\nc(ub1) = h5, so c(u\nb\n1) = h5. This implies, since c(w\nb\n1) = h2 or c(w\nb\n1) = h4, that c(w\nb\n1) = h4.\nBut this means that wb2w\nb\n1 covers h3h4, which we have already excluded as a possibility.\nAssume that for some a \u2208 GA \\ SA, aua2 covers h3h4, so c(a) = h3 and c(ua2) = h4.\nBecause ua1 and u\na\n2 are adjacent, c(u\na\n1) = h3 or c(u\na\n1) = h5, but since u\na\n1 is adjacent to h0 and\nc(h0) = h0, we have c(ua1) = h5. Similarly, c(w\na\n1) = h2 or c(w\na\n1) = h4, but since w\na\n1 and u\na\n1\nare adjacent, we have c(wa1) = h4. Hence aw\na\n1 covers h3h4, but we have already seen this is\nimpossible.\nNow assume that for some a \u2208 GA \\ SA, axaba covers h3h4, so c(a) = h3 and c(xaba ) = h4.\nNow c(ua1) = h1 or c(u\na\n1) = h5, but since u\na\n1 and x\nab\na are adjacent, we have c(u\na\n1) = h5.\nBecause c(ua2) must be adjacent to c(a) = h3 as well as c(u\na\n1) = h5, we have c(u\na\n2) = h4.\nHence aua2 covers h3h4, but we have already seen this is impossible.\nSuppose that for some b \u2208 GB \\ SB, xabb b covers h3h4, so c(xabb ) = h3 and c(b) = h4.\nNow c(ub1) = h1 or c(u\nb\n1) = h5, but since b and u\nb\n1 are adjacent, we must have c(u\nb\n1) = h5.\nBecause c(wb1) must be adjacent to c(x\nab\nb ) = h3, we have c(w\nb\n1) = h2 or c(w\nb\n1) = h4. But u\nb\n1\nand wb1 are adjacent, so c(w\nb\n1) = h4. This means x\nab\nb w\nb\n1 covers h3h4, which we have already\nruled out as a possibility.\nNow suppose that for some a \u2208 GA\\SA and some b \u2208 GB\\SB, ab covers h3h4, so c(a) = h3\nand c(b) = h4. Since ua2 is adjacent to a and we have seen au\na\n2 does not cover h3h4, we must\nhave c(ua2) = h2. Now c(u\na\n1) = h1 or c(u\na\n1) = h5, but since u\na\n1 and u\na\n2 are adjacent, we must\nhave c(ua1) = h1. Also, c(x\nab\na ) must be adjacent to c(u\na\n1) = h1 and c(a) = h3, so c(x\nab\na ) = h2.\nSimilarly, c(xabb ) must be adjacent to c(x\nab\na ) = h2 and c(b) = h4, so c(x\nab\nb ) = h3. But this\nmeans xabb b covers h3h4, which we have already seen is impossible.\n12\nSuppose that for some a \u2208 GA\\SA and some b \u2208 GB\\SB, xabb xaba covers h3h4, so c(xabb ) = h3\nand c(xaba ) = h4. Since a is adjacent to x\nab\na and we have seen ax\nab\na does not cover h3h4, we\nmust have c(a) = h5. Because c(b) must be adjacent to c(a) = h5 and c(xabb ) = h3, we have\nc(b) = h4. But then xabb b covers h3h4, and we have seen this is impossible.\nLastly, if ah2 ( or ah4 ) is an edge of G\u2032, assuming c(a) = h3 and c(h2) = h4 ( or c(a) = h3\nand c(h4) = h4 ) immediately leads us to a contradiction, since c(h3) = h1.\nFrom all this we obtain that assuming c(h3) = h1 leads us to the conclusion that no edge\nof G\u2032 covers h3h4, contradicting the fact that c is a compaction.\nSimilarly, one can show that assuming c(h3) = h5 leads to the conclusion that no edge\nof G\u2032 covers h2h3 \u2014 details are left to the reader.\nHence c(h3) = h3, which means that c(W ) = {h2, h3, h4}.\nNow we show c(h1) 6= c(h5). To the contrary, assume c(h1) = c(h5). Since c(h0) = h0,\nwe have c(h1), c(h5) \u2208 {h1, h5}. Due to symmetry, we can without loss of generality assume\nc(h1) = c(h5) = h1. Since c(U) = {h1, h0, h5}, it must be the case that c(uv1) = h5 for\nsome v \u2208 V (G) \\ V (S). Now c(wv1) and c(h2) must both be adjacent to c(h3) = h3, so\nc(wv1), c(h2) \u2208 {h2, h4}. Because c(uv1) = h5 and uv1 and wv1 are adjacent, c(wv1) = h4.\nSimilarly, because c(h0) = h0 and h1 and h2 are adjacent, c(h2) = h2. Now c(yv2) must be\nadjacent to c(h2) = h2 and c(wv1) = h4, so c(y\nv\n2) = h3. Also, c(y\nv\n1) must be adjacent to\nc(h5) = h1 and c(uv1) = h5, so c(y\nv\n1) = h0. Thus we have that y\nv\n1 and y\nv\n2 are adjacent in G\n\u2032,\nbut c(yv1) = h0 and c(y\nv\n2) = h3 are not adjacent in C6 \u2014 a contradiction.\nHence c(h1) 6= c(h5). That is, c({h1, h5}) = {h1, h5}. Without loss of generality, we can\ntake c(h1) = h1 and c(h5) = h5. Since c(h3) = h3, we have c(h2), c(h4) \u2208 {h2, h4}. Because h1\nand h2 are adjacent in G\u2032 and the distance between c(h1) = h1 and h4 in C6 is 3, it must be\nthat c(h2) 6= h4 and so c(h2) = h2. Similarly, because h5 and h4 are adjacent in G\u2032 and the\ndistance between c(h5) = h5 and h2 in C6 is 3, it must be that c(h4) 6= h2, and so c(h4) = h4.\nThus c(hi) = hi for all i = 0, 1, . . . , 5, and c : V (G\u2032)\u2192 V (C6) is a retraction. 2\nThe last claim is a simple observation that completes the proof of (\u2217) and thus also of Theo-\nrem 8.\nClaim 5 Suppose G\u2032 is pinchable to C6. Then G retracts to S.\nProof : By Claims 3 and 4 we know there exists a retraction r : V (G\u2032)\u2192 V (S). Because S\nis an induced subgraph of G, and G is an induced subgraph of G\u2032, restricting r to G gives us\nwhat we need. 2\n5 A polynomial-time algorithm for planar bipartite graphs\nIn this section, we prove the following.\nTheorem 10 Restricted to planar bipartite graphs, the decision problem 3-Mixing is in the\ncomplexity class P.\nHenceforth, let G denote a bipartite planar graph. To prove the theorem we need some\ntechnical results.\n13\nLemma 11 Let P be a shortest path between distinct vertices u and v in a bipartite graph H.\nThen H is pinchable to P .\nProof : Let P have vertices u = v0, v1, . . . , vk\u22121, vk = v, and let T be a breadth-first spanning\ntree of H rooted at u that contains P (we can choose T so that it contains P since P is a\nshortest path ). Now, working in T , pinch all vertices at distance one from u to v1. Next\npinch all vertices at distance two from u to v2. Continue until all vertices at distance k from u\nare pinched to vk = v. If necessary, arbitrary pinches on the vertices at distance at least k+1\nfrom u will yield P . 2\nLemma 12 Let H be a bipartite graph.\n(i) Let u and v be two vertices in H properly pre-coloured with colours from 1, 2, 3. Then\nthis colouring can be extended to a proper 3-colouring of H.\n(ii) Let u, v and w be three vertices in H with uv, vw \u2208 E(H). Suppose u, v, w are properly\npre-coloured with colours from 1, 2, 3. Then this colouring can be extended to a proper\n3-colouring of H.\n(iii) Suppose the vertices of a 4-cycle in H are properly 3-coloured. Then this 3-colouring\ncan be extended to a proper 3-colouring of H.\nProof : (i) is trivial.\n(ii) Without loss of generality we can assume that the colouring of u, v, w is 1-2-1 or 1-2-3.\nIn the first instance, since H is bipartite, we can extend the colouring of u, v, w to a colouring\nof H using colours 1 and 2 only. For the second case, we can use the same 1,2-colouring,\nexcept leaving w with colour 3.\n(iii) Since any 3-colouring of a C4 has two vertices with the same colour, without loss of\ngenerality we can assume the 4 vertices are coloured 1-2-1-2 or 1-2-1-3. Colourings similar to\nthose used in (ii) above will immediately lead to the appropriate 3-colourings of H. 2\nThe sequence of claims that follows outlines an algorithm that, given G as input, determines\nin polynomial time whether or not G is 3-mixing.\nThe first claim is a simple observation.\nClaim 6 If G is not connected, then G is 3-mixing if and only if every component of G is\n3-mixing.\nWe next show how we can reduce the case to 2-connected graphs.\nClaim 7 Suppose G has a cut-vertex v. Let H1 be a component of G\u2212 v. Denote by G1 the\nsubgraph of G induced by V (H1)\u222a {v}, and let G2 be the subgraph induced by V (G) \\ V (H1).\nThen G is 3-mixing if and only if both G1 and G2 are 3-mixing.\nProof : If G is 3-mixing, then clearly so are G1 and G2. Conversely, if G is not 3-mixing, we\nknow by Theorem 4 that there must exist a 3-colouring \u03b1 of G and a cycle C in G such that\nW (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0. But because C must lie completely in G1 or G2, we have that G1 or G2 is not\n3-mixing. 2\n14\nNow we can assume that G is 2-connected. In the next claim we will show that we can\nactually assume G to be 3-connected.\nClaim 8 Suppose G has a 2-vertex-cut {u, v}. Let H1 be a component of G\u2212{u, v}. Denote\nby G1 the subgraph of G induced by V (H1) \u222a {u, v}, and let G2 be the subgraph induced by\nV (G) \\ V (H1). For i = 1, 2, let `i be the distance between u and v in Gi.\nThen only the following cases can occur :\n(i) We have `1 = `2 = 1. Then G is 3-mixing if and only if both G1 and G2 are 3-mixing.\n(ii) We have `1 = `2 = 2. ( So for i = 1, 2, there is a vertex wi \u2208 V (Gi) so that uwi, vwi \u2208\nE(Gi). ) Let G\u22171 be the subgraph of G induced by V (G1)\u222a{w2} and let G\u22172 be the subgraph\ninduced by V (G2)\u222a{w1}. Then G is 3-mixing if and only if both G\u22171 and G\u22172 are 3-mixing.\n(iii) We have `1 + `2 \u2265 6. Then G is not 3-mixing.\nProof : Because G is bipartite, `1 and `2 must have the same parity. If `1 = 1 or `2 = 1,\nthen there is an edge uv in G, and this same edge must appear in both G1 and G2. This\nguarantees that both `1 = `2 = 1, and shows that we always have one of the three cases.\n(i) In this case we have an edge uv in all of G,G1, G2. If one of G1 and G2 is not 3-mixing,\nsay G1, we must have a 3-colouring \u03b1 of G1 and a cycle C in G1 for which W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0.\nBy Lemma 12 (i) we can easily extend \u03b1 to the whole of G, showing that G is not 3-mixing.\nOn the other hand, if G is not 3-mixing, we know we must have a 3-colouring \u03b2 of G and a\ncycle D in G for which W (\n\u2212\u2192\nD,\u03b2) 6= 0. If D is contained entirely in one of G1 or G2, we are\ndone. If not, D must pass through u and v. For i = 1, 2, consider the cycle Di formed from\nthe part of D that is in Gi together with the edge uv. From Lemma 7 it follows that one\nof D1 and D2 has non-zero weight under \u03b2, showing that G1 or G2 is not 3-mixing.\n(ii) If one of G\u22171 and G\u22172 is not 3-mixing, we can use a similar argument as in (i) ( now\nusing Lemma 12 (ii) ) to conclude that G is not 3-mixing. For the converse we assume G is\nnot 3-mixing. So there is a 3-colouring \u03b1 of G and a cycle C in G for which W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0.\nIf C is contained entirely in one of G\u22171 or G\u22172, we are done. If not, C must pass through u\nand v. If C does not contain w1, then for i = 1, 2, consider the cycle Ci formed from the part\nof C that is in G\u2217i together with the path uw1v. From Lemma 7 it follows that one of C\n1, C2\nhas non-zero weight under \u03b1, showing that G\u22171 or G\u22172 is not 3-mixing. If w1 is contained in C,\nthen we can use the same argument but now using the edge uw1 or vw1 as the path ( at least\none of these edges is not on C since C is not contained entirely in G\u22172 ).\n(iii) For i = 1, 2, let Pi be a shortest path between u and v in Gi, so Pi has length `i.\nThen, using Lemma 11, we can see that G is pinchable to C`1+`2 \u2014 just follow, in G, the\nsequence of pinches that transforms G1 into P1 and G2 into P2. Since `1 + `2 \u2265 6, C`1+`2 is\nof course pinchable to C6, and hence G is not 3-mixing. 2\nFrom now on we consider G to be 3-connected, and can therefore use the following result of\nWhitney \u2014 for details, see, for example, [3] pp. 78\u201380.\nTheorem 13 (Whitney) Any two planar embeddings of a 3-connected graph are equivalent.\n15\nHenceforth, we identify G with its ( essentially unique ) embedding in the plane. Given a\ncycle D in G, denote by Int(D) and Ext(D) the set of vertices inside and outside of D,\nrespectively. If both Int(D) and Ext(D) are non-empty, D is said to be separating. For D a\nseparating cycle in G, let us write GInt(D) = G\u2212 Ext(D) and GExt(D) = G\u2212 Int(D).\nWe next consider the case that G has a separating 4-cycle.\nClaim 9 Suppose G has a separating 4-cycle D. Then G is 3-mixing if and only if GInt(D)\nand GExt(D) are both 3-mixing.\nProof : To prove necessity, we show that if one of GInt(D) or GExt(D) is not 3-mixing,\nthen G is not 3-mixing. Without loss of generality, suppose that GInt(D) is not 3-mixing, so\nthere exists a 3-colouring \u03b1 of GInt(D) and a cycle C in GInt(D) with W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0. The\n3-colouring of the vertices of the 4-cycle D can be extended to a 3-colouring of GExt(D)\n( use Lemma 12 (iii) ). The combination of the 3-colourings of GInt(D) and GExt(D) gives a\n3-colouring of G with a non-zero weight cycle, showing G is not 3-mixing.\nTo prove sufficiency, we show that if G is not 3-mixing, then at least one of GInt(D)\nand GExt(D) must fail to be 3-mixing. Suppose that \u03b1 is a 3-colouring of G for which\nthere is a cycle C with W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) 6= 0. If C is contained entirely within GInt(D) or GExt(D)\nwe are done; so let us assume that C has some vertices in Int(D) and some in Ext(D).\nThen applying Lemma 7 ( repeatedly, if necessary ) we can find a cycle C \u2032 contained entirely\nin GInt(D) or GExt(D) for which W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032, \u03b1) 6= 0, completing the proof. 2\nWe call a face of G with k edges in its boundary a k-face, and a face with at least k edges\nin its boundary a \u2265 k-face. The number of \u2265 6-faces in G \u2014 which now we can assume is a\n3-connected bipartite planar graph with no separating 4-cycle \u2014 will lead to our final claim.\nClaim 10 Let G be a 3-connected bipartite planar graph with no separating 4-cycle. Then G\nis 3-mixing if and only if it has at most one \u2265 6-face.\nProof : Let us first prove sufficiency. Suppose G has no \u2265 6-faces, so has only 4-faces. Let \u03b1\nbe any 3-colouring of G and let C be any cycle in G. We show W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) = 0 by induction on\nthe number of faces inside C. If there is just one face inside C, C is in fact a facial 4-cycle and\nW (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) = 0. For the inductive step, let C be a cycle with r \u2265 2 faces in its interior. If, for\ntwo consecutive vertices u, v of C, we have vertices a, b \u2208 Int(C) together with edges ua, ab, bv\nin G, let C \u2032 be the cycle formed from C by the removal of the edge uv and the addition of\nedges ua, ab, bv. If not, check whether for three consecutive vertices u, v, w of C, there is a\nvertex a \u2208 Int(C) with edges ua, aw in G. If so, let C \u2032 be the cycle formed from C by the\nremoval of the vertex v and the addition of the edges ua, aw. If neither of the previous two\ncases apply, we must have, for u, v, w, x four consecutive vertices of C, an edge ux inside C.\nIn such a case, let C \u2032 be the cycle formed from C by the removal of vertices v, w and the\naddition of the edge ux. In all cases we have that C \u2032 has r \u2212 1 faces in its interior, so, by\ninduction, we can assume W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC \u2032, \u03b1) = 0. From Lemma 7 we then obtain W (\n\u2212\u2192\nC ,\u03b1) = 0.\nSuppose now that G contains exactly one \u2265 6-face. Without loss of generality we can\nassume that this face is the outside face, and hence the argument above will work exactly the\nsame to show that G is 3-mixing.\n16\nNow we prove necessity, showing that if G contains at least two \u2265 6-faces, then G is\npinchable to C6. For f a \u2265 6-face in G, a separating cycle D is said to be f-separating if f\nlies inside D. Let f and fo be two \u2265 6-faces in G, where we can assume fo is the outer face\nof G, and let C be the cycle bounding f . Our claim is that we can successively pinch vertices\ninto a cycle of length at least 6 without ever introducing an f -separating 4-cycle \u2014 we will\ninitially do this around C.\nLet x, y, z be any three consecutive vertices of C with y having degree at least 3 \u2014 if\nthere is no such vertex y, then G is simply a cycle of length at least 6 and we are done. Let a\nbe a neighbour of y distinct from x and z, such that the edges ya and yz form part of the\nboundary of a face adjacent to f . If the result of pinching a and z introduces no f -separating\n4-cycle, then pinch a and z and repeat the process. If pinching a and z does result in the\ncreation of an f -separating 4-cycle, this must be because the path ay, yz forms part of an\nf -separating 6-cycle D. We now show how we can find alternative pinches which do not\nintroduce an f -separating 4-cycle. The fact that D is f -separating means there is a path\nP \u2286 D of length 4 between a and z. Note that P cannot contain y, for this would contradict\nthe fact that G has no separating 4-cycle. Consider the graph G\u2032 = GInt(D) \u2212 {yz}. We\nclaim that the path P \u2032 = P \u222a {ay} is a shortest path between y and z in G\u2032. To see this,\nremember that G is bipartite, so any path between y and z in G has to have odd length. We\ncannot have another edge yz \u2208 E(G\u2032) since G is simple. Finally, any path between y and z\nin G\u2032 would, together with the edge yz, form an f -separating cycle in G. Hence a path of\nlength 3 between y and z would contradict the fact that G has no separating 4-cycle. Using\nLemma 11, we see G\u2032 is pinchable to P \u2032. Using the same sequence of pinches in G will pinch\nGInt(D) into D. Note this introduces no separating 4-cycle into the resulting graph. Now, if\nnecessary, we can repeat the process by pinching vertices into D, which now bounds a 6-face.\nThis completes the proof. 2\nThe sequence of Claims 6 \u2013 10 can easily be used to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm to\ncheck if a given planar bipartite graph G is 3-mixing. This completes the proof of Theorem 10.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are indebted to Gary MacGillivray for helpful discussions and for bringing reference [7]\nto our attention.\nReferences\n[1] R.J.
