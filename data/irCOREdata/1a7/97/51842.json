However, little is known about how well facial beauty can be detected at \nparafoveal and peripheral vision. Participants in this study judged relative attractiveness \nof a face pair presented simultaneously at several eccentricities from the central fixation. \nThe results show that beauty is not only detectable at parafovea but also at periphery. The \ndiscrimination performance at parafovea was indistinguishable from the performance \naround the fovea. Moreover, performance was well above chance even at the periphery. \nThe results show that the visual system is able to use the low spatial frequency \ninformation to appraise attractiveness. These findings not only provide an explanation for \nwhy a beautiful face could capture attention when central vision is already engaged \nelsewhere, but also reveal the potential means by which a crowd of faces is quickly \nscanned for attractiveness.  \n \nKeywords: Facial attractiveness; Fovea; Parafovea; Peripheral vision \n \n  \nDetecting Facial Beauty in Periphery    3                    \nBeauty is difficult to ignore even when attention is already engaged in a different \ntask. Sui and Liu (2009) recently demonstrated that a task-irrelevant attractive face \npresented at parafovea can compete with an ongoing task for spatial attention, suggesting \ncoarse-scale facial information outside the central vision is sufficient for automatic \nappraisal of facial attractiveness (also see Bachmann 2007, for a study of coarse-scale \ninformation for facial beauty discrimination at central vision). However, because the face \nin the Sui and Liu study was presented at a fixed distance (3.6\u00b0) from the fixation, it was \nnot clear whether this effect also extends to far parafoveal and even peripheral vision. \nNeither was it clear whether the accuracy of attractiveness discrimination at parafovea is \nas reliable as in the fovea. Here we examined these questions systematically. Participants \njudged relative attractiveness of a face pair presented simultaneously at several \neccentricities from the central fixation. \nIt is well known that when a pair of faces is presented, the more attractive face of \nthe two tends to draw greater attention and more inspections (Leder et al 2010; Shimojo \net al 2003). In these and other similar studies, researchers have focused on how central \nvision is engaged in the processing of facial beauty. Their results demonstrate that \nattractive faces tend to dictate preferential eye gaze and fixations, which result in \nfoveation of the preferred face for more detailed information processing.  \nUnlike most prior studies, the main interest of the present paper is the \ndiscrimination of facial beauty beyond the central vision. Given that a vast portion of our \nvisual environment falls outside the foveal region, being able to monitor and assess the \nvisual information and events in the parafoveal and peripheral regions is critical for \nadaptive reasons. The same ability is also necessary for covert attention where the focus \n  \nDetecting Facial Beauty in Periphery    4                    \nof attention often does not coincide with the high-resolution fovea. Prior research has \nrevealed that the ability to discriminate a face identity drops rapidly as a function of \neccentricity (M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al 2001; Melmoth et al 2000). Moreover, past studies have \nidentified a band of middle frequencies (approximately 8-16 cycles per face) that is \ncritical for face recognition (Bachmann 1991; Costen et al 1994, 1996; Fiorentini et al \n1983; Harmon 1971; Harmon and Julesz 1973; Peli et al 1994). However, discrimination \nor appraisal of facial beauty may require less spatial details than the discrimination of \nfacial identities. There is evidence that low spatial frequency information is often \nsufficient for discriminating facial beauty or some common facial expressions such as \nanger and fear presented at the central vision (Bachmann 2007; Schyns and Oliva 1999; \nVuilleumier et al 2003). Perhaps the early stage of attractiveness appraisal can rely on \nlow spatial frequency information that is available at the periphery. To our knowledge, \nthe present study was the first attempt to test this hypothesis at the periphery.  \nTo prevent saccadic eye movements to either face image, we presented each face \npair on the two sides of the central fixation for a brief 100 ms. The participant\u2019s fixation \nwas monitored by an eye tracker during the task. Apart from pairing an attractive face \nwith an unattractive one based on pre-rated scores, we also asked our participants to \nprovide their own attractiveness rating after they had completed the discrimination task. \nWe predicted a stronger effect of eccentricity on discrimination of facial beauty when the \ndifference in attractiveness between two faces is deemed small by participants. \n \n \n \n  \nDetecting Facial Beauty in Periphery    5                    \nMethod \nMaterials  \n The face database was obtained from University of St. Andrews. All faces were \nfrontal-view Caucasians with neutral expression, and were pre-rated for attractiveness on \na 7-point scale. We chose 17 attractive (mean rating = 4.55, SD = 0.30) and 17 \nunattractive (mean rating = 2.03, SD = 0.22) faces for this study. The chosen faces had no \nvisible facial marks or distinctive hair style (e.g. fringe). The greyscale faces were then \ncropped to remove external features and to fit within an oval window subtending 8.0 \u00d7 \n6.2\u00b0 of visual angle, equivalent to the size of a real face shown at a distance during \ntypical conversation (Henderson et al 2005). All images were scaled to a same mean \nluminance and root-mean-square contrast. Each attractive face was randomly paired with \nan unattractive face. These two faces were then presented bilaterally at equidistance from \na central fixation. The three levels of eccentricity (the distance between the inner edge of \na face image and the fixation) were 2\u00b0, 5\u00b0 and 10\u00b0, which were chosen to probe foveal, \nparafoveal and peripheral vision, respectively. Each face was used three or four times in \ndifferent attractive\/unattractive combinations to create 60 pairs (20 pairs per eccentricity). \nEach pair was presented twice but in a separate block to counterbalance left\/right \npresentation location. This amounted to a total of 120 trials. \n \nParticipants \nSeventeen Caucasian participants (12 women, mean age = 25, SD = 10) with \nnormal vision viewed the stimulus display binocularly from 57 cm on a chin rest. \nInformed consent was obtained from each participant, and all procedures complied with \n  \nDetecting Facial Beauty in Periphery    6                    \nthe World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration as revised in October 2008. During \nthe experiment, their fixations were monitored using a Video Eyetracker Toolbox with 50 \nHz sampling frequency and 0.25\u00b0 accuracy (Cambridge Research Systems). The stimulus \nwas presented through a ViSaGe graphics system on a gamma-corrected monitor (1024 \u00d7 \n768 pixels, 100 Hz frame rate, Mitsubishi) with grey background.  \n \nProcedure  \nEach trail started with a warning tune, followed by a 1-sec central fixation. A pair \nof faces was then presented for 100 ms. Participants were instructed to maintain their \nfixation and to respond as accurately and as quickly as possible by pressing one of the \ntwo buttons to indicate whether the left or right face was more attractive. No feedback \nwas given. The inter-trial interval was 1.5 sec.  \n To examine how the participant\u2019s own judgement of attractiveness affects the \ndiscrimination performance, all participants also performed a separate, self-paced task \nwhere the same face pairs were presented side by side with 1\u00b0 gap in a randomised order. \nThe task was to indicate which face within the pair was more attractive and how different \nthe two faces was in attractiveness on a 3-point scale (1 = slightly different, 3 = very \ndifferent). The task was always performed after the discrimination task. For these \nmanipulated face images, all participants\u2019 judgements in the rating task were consistent \nwith the answers defined by the pre-rating scores, t(16) = 1.03, p = .32. That is, within a \nface pair, the face with higher pre-rating score in attractiveness was also judged to be \nmore attractive by our participants (mean attractiveness discrimination performance = \n99.9%, SD = 0.40).    \n  \nDetecting Facial Beauty in Periphery    7                    \n \nResults \nIn total 2.8% of the trials were excluded from analysis because the eye drifted 1\u00b0 \nor more away from the central fixation during the face presentation. Results in Figure 1A \nshow that the attractiveness discrimination rate was significantly affected by the \neccentricity, F(2, 48) = 16.8, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = 0.41. The performance was indistinguishable \nfor faces presented at 2\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 eccentricity (>80%), t(16) = 1.4, p = .18. Performance at \n10\u00b0eccentricity (>65%) was significantly lower than these but was clearly above-chance, \nt(16) = 7.13, p < .001. Eccentricity had no significant impact on the reaction time data, \nF(2, 48) = 1.33, p = .28, \u03b7p2 = 0.05. \nDiscrimination performance was also analyzed according to the perceived \ndifference between the attractiveness of two simultaneously presented faces (Figure 1B). \nThere was again a significant main effect of eccentricity, F(2, 133) = 19.45, p < .001, \u03b7p2 \n= 0.23. The main effect of perceived attractiveness difference approached the level of \nsignificance, F(2, 133) = 2.35 p = .10, \u03b7p2 = 0.03, suggesting an easier discrimination \nwhen one face in a pair was clearly more attractive than another. The interaction between \nthe two variables was not significant, F(4, 133) = 0.59, p = .67, \u03b7p2 = 0.02. Again, \nanalysis of the reaction time data did not reveal any significant result. \n \nDiscussion \n Prior research suggests that facial attractiveness may be detectable at parafovea \n(Sui and Liu 2009). Our new results show that beauty is not only detectable at parafovea \nbut also at periphery. Furthermore, the attractiveness discrimination at parafovea (5\u00b0) was \nindistinguishable from the performance around the fovea (2\u00b0). Comparing to parafovea, \n  \nDetecting Facial Beauty in Periphery    8                    \nthe performance at periphery (10\u00b0) was clearly worsened. However, it is remarkable that \neven here the discrimination performance was still well above-chance. This suggests that \nour visual system is able to use the low spatial frequency information to perform rapid \nappraisal of faces for attractiveness. This is consistent with prior observation that physical \ncarriers of facial beauty are originally present in the coarse configural properties of faces \n(Bachmann 2007). Finally, our results show that such a judgment of relative \nattractiveness at the periphery is sensitive to how much a face is more attractive than the \nother. Discrimination errors appeared to be higher when the perceived difference in \nattractiveness between the two faces was smaller. This finding suggests that finer \ndiscrimination or ranking of facial beauty may require more facial details contained in \nhigher spatial frequencies. The capacity of the peripheral vision may be limited to \ncategorical attractive judgements. \nThese findings not only provide an explanation for why a beautiful face could \ncapture attention when central vision is already engaged elsewhere, but also reveal the \npotential means by which a crowd of faces is quickly scanned and appraised for \nattractiveness. It is interesting to note that the participants had little difficulty to appraise \ntwo briefly flashed faces very quickly. This means the judgement of relative \nattractiveness may not require foveation when a face is clearly more attractive than the \nother. Moreover, it means that a quick sampling of attractive faces from a crowd is \npossible because a relatively small number of fixations would be sufficient if it is \nunnecessary to foveate on each individual faces.  \nThe biological significance of beauty detection may be comparable to some well-\nstudied facial cues such as threatening and fearful expressions that are also known to be \n  \nDetecting Facial Beauty in Periphery    9                    \ndetected rapidly at extrafovea (Goren and Wilson 2006; Leppanen and Nelson 2009). \nApart from potential danger, our study shows that peripheral vision is also sensitive to \npotential reward. The visual system may be evolved to rapidly detect attractiveness in the \nperiphery, which may trigger the act of foveation for detailed visual analysis.
