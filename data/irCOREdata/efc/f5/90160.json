INTRODUCTION \nTowards the end of the twentieth century, the combined forces of global \neconomic integration processes and financial crises spurred restructuring of \nfinancial firms and stimulated reforms to international and domestic regulation \nof financial services markets. Changes to the regulatory architecture in many \njurisdictions produced new agencies and novel statutory powers (Briault \n1999; Ferran 2003). Regulatory reform may draw on distinct local histories, \npolitics, and institutional imperatives, but changes in the global setting of \nthese reforms have produced similarities. One notable similarity is the emergence \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 2 - \n \n \nin several states of new mandates for national governments to educate, as \nwell as protect, financial consumers (OECD 2005a). Acting on these mandates, \nregulators have begun to promote financial literacy education, intending to \nchange how consumers behave. \n \nProponents often cast financial literacy education as a form of consumer \nempowerment, using empowerment to mean reducing barriers to participation \nin markets and improving the accessibility of relevant information (e.g., \nCartwright 2004; Fox, Bartholomae & Lee 2005; Howells 2005). Seen from \nthis perspective, financial education works in concert with consumer protection \nmeasures to improve decision-making skills and enable individuals to \nmake use of remedies such as disclosure and reflection rights. More critical \nexplanations view financial education as responding to the interests of \nstates and firms in expanding consumer markets for financial products, and \nas facilitating a shift from the state to the individual of responsibility for \npersonal economic security (Froud et al. 2006; Odih & Knights 1999). \nFinancial literacy education features in these explanations not so much as \nconsumer empowerment but rather as an instance of responsibilization, a \nform of regulation by which the state holds individuals accountable for \naspects of market governance and social security that it used to provide.1 \nResponsibilization has a more complicated relationship with standard \nconsumer protection measures than does the notion of empowerment. Although \nsometimes promoted as strengthening autonomy, responsibilization increases \nindividuals\u2019 exposure to risk and acts on individual consciousness in ways \nthat may conflict with traditional conceptions of consumer sovereignty. \nDrawing on these themes of market expansion, consumer empowerment, \nand individual responsibilization, this article critically analyses UK and \nCanadian policy discourse on financial education. Descriptively, the analysis \nidentifies how regulators in these states represent the behavior they seek to \npromote and their visions of the role of the literate consumer in the contemporary \nfinancial marketplace. More critically, I compare regulators\u2019 accounts of the \ngoals of financial education with economic justifications for consumer protection \nmeasures and with findings from behavioral research on individual decisionmaking. \n \nThis analysis exposes contradictions related to the idea of consumer \nsovereignty and provides reasons to question the feasibility of deploying \nfinancial education to influence consumers and, through them, financial markets. \n \nWhile the article refers to recent financial literacy initiatives and policy \noutputs in Canada and the UK, it concentrates on how regulators\u2019 texts \nrepresent consumer education. This focus on representations stems from the \npremise that policymakers do not simply observe problems that regulatory \naction purports to solve, but through their communications actively contribute \nto dominant understandings of perceived needs for regulatory action. How \nthey interpret the problem of financial illiteracy and communicate the goals \nof financial education are therefore significant dimensions of their policy \nactivities (Yeung 2005). Another reason to pay close attention to policy \ndiscourses is the pre-eminence of consumer empowerment claims in the \nfinancial education literature, which tends to orient its critical questions \ntowards the efficacy of particular initiatives rather than the aspirations \nof the regulatory project (e.g., Brennan & Ritters 2004; Klemme 2002). \nThis focus may obscure the extent to which financial literacy measures \npurport to advance other objectives, such as changing individual \nunderstandings about the appropriate role of the state in social welfare or \nmodifying consumer expectations of firms and regulators. By examining \npolicy makers\u2019 accounts of the purposes of financial literacy development, \nthis article illuminates the complexity of regulatory goals and draws \nattention to potentially contradictory aspects of educational interventions \n(Gross 2003, 2005). Part II outlines the rise of financial literacy education as a  \nRegulatory project, situates it in the context of decentered regulation and elaborates on \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 3 - \n \n \nthe key themes of market expansion, empowerment, and responsibilization. \nPart III describes the development of financial literacy education policies in \nCanada and the UK, and analyses the regulators\u2019 policy documents in the \nlight of these themes. Part IV reflects on the findings and explores some of \ntheir implications for financial consumers and for regulation in this field. \nPart V is a short conclusion. \n \nII. THE RISE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY EDUCATION AS A REGULATORY \nPROJECT \n \nA. THE EMERGENCE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY ON THE PUBLIC POLICY \nAGENDA \n \nNeither anxiety about consumer skills nor interest in consumer education is \na new entrant on the terrain of public policy (Kyrk 1923; Mitchell 1950; \nParr 1999). Consumer education has featured in debates about consumer \nprotection policy since early in the twentieth century, while organizations \nproviding quasi-educational services, such as debt counselling and financial \nadvice, populate the nongovernmental sectors of several states (Braucher 2003; \nGross 2003). Recent developments differ from these examples, however, \ninsofar as regulators, who traditionally have focused on governing behavior \non the supply side of financial markets, deploy education systematically to \nchange consumer demand. \n \nThis approach to consumer education extends the work of securities \nregulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), \nwhich in 1993 established an Office of Investor Education and Assistance to \nprovide advice on investing \u201cwisely\u201d and avoiding fraud (Fanto 1998). \nSubsequent initiatives of the SEC and other securities regulators produced \ninvestor education programs offering \u201ctips and traps\u201d advice and information \nabout disclosure rights. Regulators may have based these programs on \nmandates to promote investor confidence in securities markets, but their \neducational activities tended to be ad hoc and responsive to scandals and \nscams (Fanto 1998). To the extent that there existed a nascent conception of a \nmore general educational role for financial regulators, it emphasized helping \ninvestors to give effect to their established preferences through such measures \nas better access to information. Unlike financial firms who turned to \nfinancial education from the late 1980s to increase product sales, financial \nregulators engaged in relatively little \u201ccheerleading\u201d education to promote \ninvestment as good practice for everyone, nor did they otherwise seek to \ninculcate savings and investment norms amongst the general populations in \ntheir jurisdictions (Fanto 1998: 162). \n \nBy the beginning of the twenty-first century a discernable shift had occurred, \nestablishing the main elements of current policy discourse. \u201cConsumers\u201d \nreplaced \u201cinvestors\u201d as the focus of attention as concerns about individuals\u2019 \nfinancial skills expanded to encompass consumption of products such as \ncredit, insurance, savings, and general banking services; and financial \nconsumers became positioned as targets, as well as beneficiaries, of states\u2019 \nfinancial educational initiatives (OECD 2004, 2005a). Aspiring to do more \nthan improve access to information, some financial regulators began to focus \non consumers\u2019 roles in financial markets, seeking to influence their thinking \nabout financial circumstances and needs, to encourage development of a \ntaste for financial property, and to support acquisition of the skills required \nto perform confidently in financial markets. \n \nIn addition, recent policy discourse often frames financial illiteracy as a \nproblem that engages national interests in the performance of domestic \nfinancial markets and represents financial education as vital to the health \nof national economies. A recent OECD report, for example, asserts that \nhigher levels of financial literacy will improve economic growth and help \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 4 - \n \n \nto reduce poverty in all economies and potentially moderate the volatility \nof financial markets in so-called \u201cemerging economies\u201d (OECD 2005a: 35). \nSometimes, the direct benefits to consumers appear almost as an \nafterthought, as in the mandate of an Australian taskforce, which describes \nthe goals of a national financial literacy strategy as to: \u201creduce poverty, \nincrease economic performance, bolster national savings and create \nwell-informed consumers\u201d (Australia. Consumer and Financial Literacy Task \nForce 2004). \n \nB. THE ECONOMIC SETTING: GLOBALIZATION AND THE EXPANSION OF \nFINANCIAL MARKETS \n \nThese shifts in policy discourse occurred in the shadow of global economic \nrestructuring processes that have expanded markets for consumer financial \nproducts and stimulated the rise of a neoliberal model of economic development \n(Harvey 2005; Soederberg, Menz & Cerny 2005). Social change wrought by \nthis model has affected both the demand for and supply of consumer financial \nproducts. Flexibilization of labor markets has made employment more \ninsecure, while interstate competition to attract or keep capital investment \nhas led to policies that limit states\u2019 capacities to deliver economic security \nand provide social services.2 \n \nTogether these effects have transformed workercitizenship \nentitlements to social welfare into privatized needs for products \nto finance personal care and development, smooth incomes over time, and \nmanage risk. Nowhere is this transformation more apparent than in relation \nto pension provision, which is frequently cited as one of the main reasons for \nstates\u2019 burgeoning interests in financial literacy (e.g., FSA 2002b; OECD 2004). \nAt the same time, technological change and deregulatory policies have \nspeeded up the pace at which money circulates and capital flows into and \nout of national economies and spawned large financial firms in search of ways \nto increase demand for their products (Briault 1999; Strange 1998). Firms \nhave found it easier to grow demand for some products than for others. Unlike \nrevolving consumer credit, for example, which firms may promote as a means \nto enjoy a desirable consumer lifestyle, savings and investment products \nappear have been more difficult to mass-market within a system of tax-funded \npublic services. Just as cuts to such services may create new financial needs, \nso too may public education policies stimulate consumer demand by heightening \nindividuals\u2019 consciousness of such needs and the capacity of different financial \nproducts to meet them. Capitalizing on this aspect of consumer education, \nfinancial firms have supplemented traditional product marketing with programs \nto increase public awareness and usage of financial products. Citigroup, for \nexample, expanded the educational work of its pre-merger firms with the \nlaunch of a ten-year program to spend at least US$200 million on promoting \nfinancial literacy throughout the world (Citigroup 1998\u20132006) while Visa, \nactive in U.S. schools since 1995, has created financial education programs for \nadults and children in Europe and North America, South American states, \nthe Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region (Visa 2006). Financial \nfirms market products to adults through quasi-educational activities such as \ninvestment exhibitions and clubs; they fund young investor competitions, \npromote financial skills training for children, and sponsor awards for \nyouth organizations (Girl Scouts 2005; Harmes 2001; Stanford 2002). \nComplementing direct delivery of their financial educational schemes, \nsome firms have sought also to \u201cplace financial education firmly on the \npublic policy agenda\u201d (Citizens Advice Bureau & Prudential plc 2005: 2), \nsponsoring research and lobbying for the inclusion of financial education in \nthe work of state regulators and educational authorities.3 \n \nOne ambitious initiative is the OECD financial education project, described by its sponsor, \nPrudential plc, as \u201ca significant three-year international research programme \n[to] guide policymakers and regulators around the world who have the task \nof implementing financial education strategies\u201d (Prudential plc 2005: 10). \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 5 - \n \n \nThis project has published a substantial report on the state of financial literacy \naround the world and a policy statement on best practices for the promotion \nof financial education. Its policy statement urges countries to improve the \nfinancial skills of their populations and to heighten consumer awareness of \nhow financial assets protect individuals against risk: it encourages regulators to \nembark on this task early in people\u2019s lives and to intervene when individuals \nare economically vulnerable (OECD 2005b: II.A.8\u201310). \n \nC. REGULATION OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES \n \n1. Decentered Regulation \n \nFinancial firms\u2019 support for state initiatives to enhance financial literacy \nresponds to and reinforces changes in regulatory goals and techniques that \nhave accompanied the rise of neoliberalism. Much contemporary re-regulation \nis decentered in the sense that governments do not monopolize regulatory \npower, but rather share it with international and regional organizations, \nindependent agencies, industry and cross industry groups, nongovernmental \norganizations, and individuals (Black 2001, 2002, 2003; Levi-Faur 2005; Scott \n2004). States may enlist new regulatory subjects, delegating governance \npowers and responsibilities for the performance of markets to firms and \nindividuals that formerly were viewed as objects or beneficiaries of regulation. \nTo use a popular metaphor, decentered regulation positions the state as \n\u201csteering\u201d rather than \u201crowing\u201d (Osborne & Gaebler 1992: 25\u201348). It disperses \ngovernance capacity through meta-regulatory practices that constitute \nmarket actors as at once regulators and regulated. 4 \n \nAs Julia Black notes: \n \n\u201cthe normative aspect of the new understanding of regulation is that intervention \nin the self-regulation of social actors . . . has to be indirect\u201d (Black \n2001: 126). \n \nThis perspective on regulation opens up new possibilities for understanding \nhow regulators view their work in relation to consumer interests (Ramsay \n2006). In particular it allows for them to position consumers not as passive \nrecipients of regulatory protection but as subjects who actively contribute \nto regulatory practice. Both the empowerment rationale for the new financial \nliteracy education mandates and the responsibilization thesis provide \njustifications for decentered regulation. Each depicts the financial consumer \nas a potentially influential market actor, with the former emphasizing \nspontaneous ordering through the invisible hand of privately held preferences, \nwhile responsibilization conceives of the consumer\u2019s ordering role as strategic \nand deliberately constructed by the state. \n \n2. Financial Education as Consumer Empowerment \n \nAccording to the economic model of financial education as consumer \nempowerment, increased supply of financial products potentially has the \neffect of widening and deepening consumer markets. At the same time, \nsubstantial growth in the number and range of financial offerings may create \nproblems for consumers since it increases complexity and the risk of the \nmarket circulating poor-quality or unusable information. Reliance on \ninadequate information threatens consumers\u2019 interests, especially their \ninterests in financial products supplied under long-term contracts or which \nrequire individuals to cede management of their assets to decision makers \nwhom they do not directly control. Uncertainty and asymmetry may impede \nentry to financial markets for some consumers, through self-selection, or \nbecause financial firms selectively market their products (Devlin 2005; Ford \n& Rowlingson 1996; Leyshon & Thrift 1995). Among consumers who do \nenter financial markets, the adverse consequences of inadequate information \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 6 - \n \n \nrange from buyers\u2019 remorse, through significant economic loss from unsuitable \nproducts, to financial ruin for some victims of exploitative marketing or \nfraud. Disclosure and reflection rights appear as initial responses to such \nrisks, whereas financial literacy education purports to strengthen the capacity \nof these rights to protect consumers (Reifner & Herwig 2003). \n \nThese regulatory responses assume a strong notion of consumer sovereignty, \nin which the consumer appears as a rational actor whose unique and robust \npreferences about personal welfare policymakers respect and seek to facilitate. \nMore than a simple claim about human agency, this notion of consumer \nsovereignty also informs the understanding that consumer demand directs \nproducers as to how much of which products to supply. According to this \nmodel, poor-quality and inaccessible information jeopardizes the reign of \nthe sovereign consumer because it impairs her ability to realize her preferences. \nKnowing that inadequate information may have such consequences, \nproducers have incentives to obfuscate or withhold relevant facts when so \ndoing shifts control to them. As long as other critical assumptions of strong \nconsumer sovereignty remain intact, however, this model offers little scope \nfor regulatory intervention to influence the substance of consumers\u2019 tastes; \nits central concern is how consumers decide. Educational measures that \nattempt to modify consumer preferences for financial products, by contrast, \ndepart from standard economic rationales for regulating consumer markets, \nrendering consumer sovereignty a questionable justification for policy.5 \n \n3.Responsibilization of the Financial Consumer \n \nResponsibilization features in contemporary scholarship as a characteristic \nstrategy of regulation in \u201clate modern\u201d societies, a strategy by which the state \nreconstructs its role from one of direct action on social welfare and personal \nsecurity to that of \u201cgovernance-at-a-distance\u201d (Garland 1996: 454; Rose 1999). \n \nResponsibilization imposes new demands on individuals to regulate their \nconduct\u2014and often that of other people\u2014to maintain their well-being. It \nthereby reproduces a distinct conception of the human actor as \u201can entrepreneur \nof his or her self\u201d (Rose 1999: 144) whose lifelong work is \u201cto make adequate \nprovision for the preservation, reproduction and reconstruction of one\u2019s human \ncapital\u201d (Rose 1999: 142 fn 13, quoting Gordon 1991: 44). Off-loading obligations \nfor social provisioning does not detach the state from social ordering but \nrather creates opportunities for it to exercise power differently, to function as \ncoordinator and catalyst, deploying distinctive knowledge, objectives, and \ngovernance techniques (Garland 1996: 454). Responsibilization thus demands \nan activist stance on the part of the state, which recasts its role from one of \ndirectly providing services and protection to fostering the institutional, \nsocial, and cultural conditions that support \u201centrepreneurship of the self.\u201d \nResponsibilization may be linked to the growth of regulators\u2019 financial \nliteracy mandates in several ways. With the shift in the role of the state from \n\u201crowing\u201d to \u201csteering\u201d on matters of social welfare, financial consumption may \nserve a site for responsibilization of individuals. Education orienting financial \nconsumers towards self-reliance complements other policies such as incentives \nto make financial choices favored by the state, cutting collective services, and \ncreating liability regimes that limit the protection consumers receive against \nmis-selling. In this way, financial literacy education may help to sustain a \nconception of the financial consumer as a responsible self-regulating subject \nwho does not look to the state for more help than it is willing to provide. \nBeyond managing the business of her own life, the work of the responsibilized \nconsumer extends to regulating the behavior of firms and the performance of \nmarkets. Literate, skilled consumers are expected to search the market effectively, \nmonitor firms attentively, switch providers efficiently, and exercise their consumer \npower to drive out of the market firms that are dishonest, incompetent, or \nindifferent to consumers\u2019 needs. Through making choices that reward or \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 7 - \n \n \npunish firms appropriately, the educated and responsible consumer may become \na resource available for regulators to enlist in the project of improving the \ncompetitive health of financial markets, nationally and in the global arena.6 \n \nLastly, financial education that purports to enhance the responsible \nconsumer\u2019s capacities to regulate herself and other market actors may \nprovide a justification for the state to reduce its investment in patrolling \nfinancial markets and monitoring financial firms, in effect relieving regulators \nof some of their responsibility for the state of the market. \n \nIII. FINANCIAL LITERACY POLICY DEVELOPMENT IN THE UK AND CANADA \n \nA. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY \n \nIn the UK, the regulatory mandate to promote financial literacy stems from \na comprehensive overhaul of financial market governance that began in \n1997. Reforms to the regulatory architecture of the markets developed in \nresponse to financial industry restructuring processes that had blurred \ndistinctions between different kinds of financial services businesses (Great \nBritain. Treasury 1998: 8). Mergers and acquisitions as well as internal firm \ngrowth produced multi-sector financial firms. Industry restructuring also \nbrought new entrants into the market as supermarkets and other non-financial \nretailers began to offer financial products (Briault 1999; Great Britain. \nTreasury 1998). \n \nThese developments created intractable problems of \u201ccommunication, coordination, \nco-operation and consistency\u201d that the regulators failed to solve \n(Briault 1999: 15). After a ten-year period that witnessed spectacular disasters \nin financial markets, including bank failures and widespread mis-selling of \nfinancial products, the government concluded that its regulatory model \ncould not adequately protect investors (Great Britain. Treasury 1998: 8). \nBreaking with its past system of sectoral regulation, the government constituted \nthe Financial Services Authority (FSA) as the \u201csingle\u201d statutory regulator \nfor the financial services industry.7 Its regulatory powers cover business \npractices and prudential regulation, and it governs a wide range of financial \nproducts and markets. \n \nThe combination of prudential regulation and market conduct regulation \nmakes the FSA\u2019s jurisdiction distinctive even among the emerging breed of \n\u201csingle market\u201d regulators (Black 2005), but it does not regulate all financial \nservices. In particular, much of the consumer credit market remains under \nthe jurisdictions of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the \nOffice of Fair Trading (OFT) (FSA & OFT 2006). Moreover the FSA\u2019s \nconsumer educational remit is not exclusive but overlaps with the educational \nmandates of several other agencies and government departments, including \nthe OFT, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), the Department \nfor Work and Pensions, and the Treasury. For most financial products and \nmarkets, however, the FSA plays the lead role in stimulating and sponsoring \nthe development of financial literacy initiatives, although it may devolve \ndelivery to other agencies. \n \nPromotion of \u201cpublic understanding of the financial system\u201d is one of four \nregulatory objectives of the FSA established in the Financial Services and \nMarkets Act 2000 (FSMA), which came into force at the end of 2001. This \nobjective includes heightening awareness of the risks and benefits of financial \nproducts and providing appropriate information and advice. (FSMA: s4) \nAnother statutory objective, consumer protection, defined in terms of \n\u201csecuring the appropriate degree of protection for consumers\u201d (FSMA: s5(1)), \nalso has significantly influenced the agency\u2019s policy on financial literacy \neducation.8  \n \n \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 8 - \n \n \nElaborating on factors relevant to determining an \u201cappropriate \ndegree\u201d of consumer protection, the Act directs the FSA to consider variations \nin consumers\u2019 experience and expertise and the \u201ccaveat emptor\u201d principle, \nthat \u201cconsumers should take responsibility for their decisions\u201d (FSMA: \ns5(2)(d)). During committee hearings on the draft Bill, members questioned \nrepresentatives of the government and FSA about the rationale for defining \nconsumer protection goals in terms ofcaveat emptor n markets for \ncomplex and unfamiliar products such as financial services (Joint Committee \n1999: q24 & q101). Its inclusion was defended by the government, however, \non the basis that: \u201cwe do not want . . . consumers [to] believe that wherever \nthey put their money and whatever decisions they make they will always be \nprotected. They will need to have that responsibility for the decisions they \nmake\u201d (Great Britain. Joint Committee 1999: q101). This perspective on \nconsumer protection reappears in the FSA\u2019s subsequent positioning of \nconsumer responsibility at the heart of its financial literacy strategy. \nConceiving of its statutory education mandate as a new departure for a \nUK financial market regulator, the FSA embarked on a policy-development \nprocess early in the transition to the new regulatory regime (Great Britain. \nFSA 1998, 1999). Initially, it conceptualized financial illiteracy primarily in \nterms of ineffective consumer decision making. A 1998 consultation paper, \nfor example, quotes a Treasury minister\u2019s description of the purposes of \nfinancial education as to \u201censure that consumers have the ability to understand \nand question the advice and literature they are given . . . help empower \nconsumers and enable them to use their \u2018buying power\u2019 more effectively\u201d \n(Great Britain. FSA 1998: 1). The consultation paper links financial literacy \neducation to the FSA\u2019s market governance powers with the proposition that \nconsumer education \u201ccould also, over time, reduce the need for detailed \nintervention\u201d9 but dismisses the possibility with the assertion that regulatory \naction remains necessary to maintain \u201cadequate standards of consumer \nprotection\u201d (Great Britain. FSA 1998: 1.3). \n \nThis model of financial literacy education as helping consumers more \neffectively to act on their preferences survived the initial consultations. While \na 1999 report makes reference to themes consistent with responsibilization \nof consumers\u2014such as improving national competitiveness and the need for \nconsumers to inform themselves and understand their responsibilities as \nwell as their rights (Great Britain. FSA 1999: 3.5 & 3.7)\u2014it does not advocate \nfinancial literacy education to reduce market regulation. Moreover, it explicitly \nrejects notions of consumer education being used to expand financial markets \n(Great Britain. FSA 1999: 3.21) and of the agency \u201cbeing prescriptive . . . or \ntelling people to save\u201d (Great Britain. FSA 1999: 3.8), characterizing financial \nliteracy education instead as a resource that enables financial consumers to \nachieve whatever they choose as their goals. In the words of the report: \u201cthe \nhigh level aim of consumer education is to help consumers make informed \nfinancial choices\u201d (Great Britain. FSA 1999: 3.5). To this end, the 1999 \nstrategy consisted of two main prongs: (a) skills development to enhance \nindividuals\u2019 abilities to manage their finances; and (b) better access to \nimpartial information and advice (Great Britain. FSA 1999: 3.7 & 3.8). \nThe model of consumer education empowering individuals to make effective \nfinancial choices sufficed to launch the FSA\u2019s financial literacy project, which \nin its first few years commissioned several research studies, established an \nextensive network of consumer education partners in public and private \nsectors, and published a vast number of documents proffering information \nand advice. Policy development continued, however, not only on financial \nliteracy education, where the FSA has collaborated with other agencies to \nrefine its conception of consumer education, but also in relation to the agency\u2019s \nother statutory objectives and its approach to market regulation (Great \nBritain. FSA 2000). Since 1999, the FSA has integrated its public awareness \nobjective into its risk-based regulatory model (Great Britain. FSA 2000, 2002a, \n2003b), a framework for regulatory action in which regulators \u201cattempt to \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 9 - \n \n \ndefine what, to their minds, are the acceptable limits of their responsibility \nand hence accountability\u201d (Black 2005: 514). With the development of this \nmodel, the FSA\u2019s view of the objectives of consumer education has come to \nconform more closely to the responsibilization thesis. \n \nRecent policy documents restate the FSA\u2019s public awareness objective as \nmaking financial consumers more \u201cconfident and capable\u201d of participating \nin financial markets (e.g., Great Britain. FSA 2003c, 2006d). While the \ndifference between \u201ccapable\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d consumers may seem more \nsemantic than material, the new model represents the rationales for financial \nliteracy in ways that correspond more closely than before to a construction \nof the responsibilized consumer as a regulatory subject. Noting that \u201cthe \ncomforting arms of the state, and of employers, are steadily being withdrawn\u201d \nand that \u201cthe responsibilities that individuals face are significant and growing\u201d \n(Great Britain. FSA 2006b: 2), the FSA envisages \u201cconfident and capable\u201d \nconsumers understanding their financial needs in new ways, a change that \nshould manifest itself in different attitudes and preferences as well as behaviours \n(Great Britain. Basic Skills Agency & FSA 2003; FSA 2003a, 2003c, 2006b, \n2006c, 2006d). \n \nAccordingly, educational interventions should not only influence how \nindividuals make decisions but also alter consumers\u2019 consciousness of their \ninterests, particularly their interests in financial planning (Great Britain. \nFSA 2005c, 2006b, 2006c, 2006d). Once convinced of the need to plan \nahead and equipped to \u201cexercise a stronger influence in markets; to take \ngreater responsibility for their own actions; and to protect themselves through \nless mis-buying and being less susceptible to mis-selling\u201d (Great Britain. \nFSA 2005a: 29, 2005b: 23), financially capable consumers should lessen the \nneed for regulatory intervention and \u201cpossibly reduce the burden on firms\u201d \n(Great Britain. FSA 2003c: 9, 2006c: 22). They also should lower the social \ncosts of what the FSA regards as irresponsible individual decision making, \nespecially the social costs of failure to plan for retirement, and of diverting \nresources away from more productive uses into managing individuals\u2019 \nfinancial crises (Great Britain. FSA 2006c: 22). \n \nResponsibilization of the consumer mirrors another FSA strategy to \nencourage financial firms to act responsibly when dealing with consumers. \n(e.g., FSA 2001, 2006e). Sometimes the agency represents itself as calibrating \ninteractions between these normative frameworks as when it states that: \n \n\u201cwe are aware of the importance of maintaining a balance between customers\u2019 \nneeds and their responsibilities, firms\u2019 duties and their reasonable expectations \nof customers\u201d (Great Britain. FSA 2005b: 25). Taken as a whole, the FSA\u2019s \nmodel financial consumer comports well with its regulatory preference \u201cto \nwork with the grain of the market and facilitate market-led solutions\u201d \n(Great Britain. FSA 2005a: 17). \n \nAfter almost three years of research, strategic planning, and experimentation \nthrough pilot studies and piecemeal initiatives, the FSA launched the \nimplementation stage of its National Strategy for Financial Capability in \nMarch 2006, budgeting \u00a310 million for the first year of work (Great Britain. \nFSA 2006b). Responding to findings from its first large-scale survey of \nfinancial literacy skills in the UK population, the FSA identifies poor financial \nplanning habits, inadequate knowledge of financial matters, and weak \ndecision-making skills when choosing financial products as significant consumer \nflaws that have potentially damaging consequences for the economy, as well \nas the affected individuals (Great Britain. FSA 2006c: 22). It finds also that \nafter reallocating responsibility for economic security among individuals, \nthe state, and employers, contemporary society now demands the most \nsophisticated financial decision making from its least experienced and capable \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 10 - \n \n \nfinancial consumers\u2014the under-40s (Great Britain. FSA 2006c). Young adults, \nstudents, and children therefore feature prominently among those targeted \nfor capability enhancement under the Strategy\u2019s seven major projects. \nThese projects include \nLearning Money Matters, a joint initiative of the FSA and the industry-sponsored \nPersonal Finance Education Group, which will receive more than \u00a315 million over five years to \nprovide financial education to 1.8 million students in 4,000 primary and secondary schools. \nThis scheme builds on earlier work with education policy makers to increase the \nprominence of personal financial education within schools, through strategies \nsuch as its integration into national curricula (Great Britain. FSA2006a, \n2006b). Helping Young Adults make sense of money, a new FSA sponsored \nprogram to be delivered through higher education institutions and by \nvoluntary organizations working with NEET youth (not in education, \nemployment, or training), anticipates take-up by 3.4 million young adults \n(Great Britain. FSA 2006b). At least 1.5 million new parents will receive \nMoney Box, which combines financial information and tools for adults with \nmaterials to \u201creinforce the financial capability message\u201d in young children \n(Great Britain. FSA 2006b: 17): four million workers will learn to Make the \nmost of your money by participating in FSA sponsored workplace seminars \non topics such as budgeting, debt, and financial planning. \n \nOther elements of the Strategy involve promoting the FSA\u2019s online financial \nmanagement tools, which purport to \u201cbuild consumer confidence and motivate \nthem into taking action\u201d (Great Britain. FSA 2006b: 14), and implementing \nan engaging communications strategy \u201cto position the FSA . . . as \nthe place to turn for impartial, general information on financial products and services\u201d \n(Great Britain. FSA 2006b: 12). Having spent \u00a32 million on consumer \ncommunications during 2005\u201306, including its high profile \u201claid bare\u201d \ncampaigns on money and mortgages,10 the FSA plans to spend a similar \namount in 2006\u201307 on a new consumer website and materials and it has set a \nthree-year goal of doubling annual web visits from two to four million (Great \nBritain. FSA 2006b: 12). The FSA also finances small-scale, experimental \nactivities to enhance financial capability through an innovation fund that last \nyear split \u00a3200,000 among twelve voluntary organizations (Great Britain. \nFSA 2006d: 26). \n \nThe FSA intends the Strategy to reach at least ten million people in the \nUK (Great Britain. FSA 2006d: 26). As well as monitoring and evaluating \nspecific programs, the agency plans to assess progress towards improving \nconsumers\u2019 financial capability by repeating its large-scale survey at regular \nintervals (Great Britain. FSA 2006c). It expects that \u201csustained and relentless \nimplementation\u201d of its program will produce a measurable \u201cstep change\u201d in \nconsumers\u2019 financial skills within five years (Great Britain. FSA 2006c: 5). \nOver the last eight years of policy development the FSA has developed its \npublic awareness mandate as a means to communicate expectations that \n\u201cconsumers should take responsibility for their decisions,\u201d the caveat emptor \nprinciple.11 This communicative process orients financial market regulation \ntowards changing how consumers understand and respond to the risks of \nconsuming some types of financial products and of failing to consume \nothers. Consumer vulnerability to mis-selling becomes a matter of consumer \nimprudence, a risk that is most effectively controlled by consumers acquiring \n\u201cthe basic knowledge and confidence to ask the right questions and to seek \nout the best products or the ones which suit them best\u201d (Cruickshank 2000: \n4.127). Through enhancement of consumer financial capability, the FSA \nmay help individuals to identify needs and learn how to seize opportunities \nand manage risks, but it locates responsibility for meeting needs and avoiding \nunwanted risks in the self-regulating regulatory subject of the confident and \ncapable consumer. \n \n \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 11 - \n \n \nB. THE FINANCIAL CONSUMER AGENCY OF CANADA \n \nThe Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) is a much smaller \norganization than the FSA, created to close a perceived gap in the governance \nof financial services market rather than to replace institutions perceived to \nhave failed. If the UK\u2019s regulatory system is characterized by an appearance \nof convergence, Canada\u2019s is highly fragmented, splitting regulation of financial \nmarkets and firms between federal and provincial\/territorial levels of \ngovernment, and delegating governance authority according to regulatory \ntask and market sector. Recent years have witnessed calls for consolidation \nof financial market regulation, but the fragmentation that spurred such \ndemands also hinders reform (Wise Persons\u2019 Committee 2003; Canada. \nSenate Committee on Banking 2006). Because critical financial markets and \nservices lie outside federal jurisdiction, changes to their governance nationally \nmay entail lengthy and complex negotiations among federal, provincial and \nterritorial governments, regulators, and nongovernmental \u201cstakeholders,\u201d \nand require brokering by expert actors positioned as standing above the political \nfray (e.g., Stromberg 1995, 1998; Wise Persons\u2019 Committee 2003). \nOne such expert body, The Task Force on the Future of the Canadian \nFinancial Services Sector, functioned as a catalyst for the creation of the \nFCAC. Its research showed that consumer protection in Canada\u2019s financial \nmarkets significantly lagged behind comparable jurisdictions in its substantive \nnorms, particularly those concerning transparency and disclosure, and \nprovisions for consumer redress (Canada. Department of Finance 1998; \nKerton 1998). Concluding, somewhat complacently, that the regulation of \nCanada\u2019s financial services markets is basically sound,12 except for some minor \nshortcomings in consumer rights and remedies, the task force nevertheless \nrecommended the appointment of a single regulator responsible for enforcing \nthe consumer protection obligations of federally regulated financial firms \n(Canada. Department of Finance 1998). \n \nThe Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act established the agency \nin 2001, giving it an unequivocal remit to advance the interests of financial \nconsumers, but granting limited regulatory powers. Unable to make conductof- \nbusiness rules for federally regulated firms, the FCAC\u2019s consumer \nprotection mandate consists of overseeing such firms\u2019 compliance with federal, \nvoluntary, and self-regulatory consumer protection measures (FCAC Act: \ns3(2)(a)\u2013(c)). Its consumer education powers appear in two statutory objects: one \nfocused specifically on consumer awareness of financial firms\u2019 duties under \nfederal law (FCAC Act: s3(2)(d)), the other creating a mandate to \u201cfoster \nan understanding of financial services and issues\u201d in collaboration with \npublic and private sector organizations (FCAC Act: s3(2)(e)). Unlike the \nFSA, the FCAC does not regulate securities and investment markets, which \nare under provincial\/territorial jurisdiction, but its consumer educational remit \nunder s3(2)(e) extends to all financial markets, including those regulated by \nprovinces and territories. \n \nAlthough its educational mandate is worded as broadly as that of the \nFSA, the FCAC operates on a much smaller scale. Its 2005 budget of Can$7.7 \nmillion for the entire agency, for example, amounts to little more than one-third \nof the \u00a310 million that the FSA will spend in 2006\u201307 solely on financial \ncapability (FCAC 2005c; FSA 2006b). Unsurprisingly given its poor funding, \ndevelopment of the FCAC\u2019s consumer education policy has proceeded in a \nlow-key fashion. While the agency reports some interesting initiatives, such \nas founding an international forum on consumer protection and education \n(FCAC 2003: 17; Fowlie 2003), it has not comprehensively surveyed consumers\u2019 \nfinancial literacy needs (OECD 2005a),13 or published consultation documents \nor position papers articulating its policy goals. Directions for its work \nappear to have been set through discussion with selected stakeholders and \nanalysis of problems reported through consumer contacts with the agency \n(FCAC 2004, 2005b). \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 12 - \n \n \nCorporate documents and educational resources shed some light on the \nFCAC\u2019s interpretation of the role and objectives of consumer education, \nilluminating the pursuit of both facilitative and more overtly normative goals, \nwith the former featuring more prominently than the latter. Annual reports \nequate the agency\u2019s educational activities with the delivery of reliable \ninformation, and to a lesser extent objective advice, to consumers seen as \ncapable of making wise choices (FCAC 2005b: 3). Only vulnerable and \ndisadvantaged consumers are thought likely to benefit from more intensive \ninterventions to modify their preferences or upgrade skills and such \u201cspecial \nneeds\u201d are framed largely in terms of general, rather than specifically financial, \nliteracy skills (FCAC 2003: 9, 2004: 15, 2005a: 9). Other financial consumers, \nby contrast, are represented as ready and willing to be responsible but lacking \nrelevant facts (FCAC 2003: 5; FCAC 2004: 7). Educating consumers thus \nconsists of supplying useful, timely, and accurate information, which \u201cempower[s] \nthem to make the right decisions\u201d (FCAC 2002: 9). \n \nThis conception of consumer education represents the FCAC as an enabler \nof choice for individuals who know generally what they want to accomplish\u2014 \nand how to achieve it, positioning the agency as direct supplier of credible \ninformation that firms do not reliably provide. When facilitating consumer \nchoice in this way, the FCAC sees itself as empowering people to participate \nin important decisions about their financial well-being and by this means \n\u201ccontributing strongly to widespread citizen engagement\u201d (FCAC 2003: 5). \nIn addition to supplying missing information, the FCAC engages in a more \nnormative project of consumer regulation when its educational materials \ninstruct consumers on their responsibilities to \u201cmake sure you get the best deal \npossible,\u201d14 \u201ctalk to your financial institution,\u201d \u201c[s]tay up to date by reading \narticles, publications and on-line information,\u201d and comparison shop.15 \n \nSuch materials represent the responsible financial consumer as \u201ca smart, safe user of \nfinancial services,\u201d16 whose informed financial decisions improve competitive \ndiscipline (FCAC 2003: 11). The FCAC\u2019s \u201csmart, safe user\u201d resembles the \nFSA\u2019s \u201cconfident and capable consumer,\u201d in being well-informed, able to \ndiscipline firms who supply shoddy financial products, and willing to embrace \nresponsibility for her own financial choices. Assumption of risk features far \nless prominently in the decisions of the Canadian \u201csmart safe user,\u201d however, \nwhose expectations of the regulator are not explicitly limited by the \ncaveat emptor norm or by attempts to manage the risk of blame for regulatory failure.17 \nAs a supplier of educational materials, the FCAC is but one of many \n \nCanadian organizations that target financial literacy skills. Banks, mutual \nfunds, and industry groups offer their own educational programming, while \nprovincial\/territorial regulators publish extensive websites featuring consumer \ninformation and advice and promoting responsible financial consumption \n(e.g., CBA 2006; CSA 2006; Investor Education Fund 2006). Federal \ngovernment departments and agencies other than the FCAC produce \neducational material, as do nongovernmental organizations working in the \nareas of individual asset-building and debt-management (Canada. Senate \nCommittee on Banking 2006: 55\u201358). Market expansion themes and anxieties \nabout consumer attitudes towards investment feature prominently in descriptions \nof public and private financial education programs, especially those \ndirected at retirement planning and at women (Condon 2006; Harmes 2001; \nStromberg 1998). \n \nMany of these programs pre-date the FCAC and are delivered without its \nassistance, raising questions about the purpose of the agency\u2019s educational \nmandate and more generally about the role of the Canadian state in fostering \nfinancial literacy. Policy makers recently discussed the latter question at a \nNational Symposium on \u201cfinancial capability,\u201d which was co-sponsored by \nthe FCAC and attended by internationally prominent advocates of financial \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 13 - \n \n \nliteracy education as regulatory project, including the OECD, the FSA, and \nthe US Federal Reserve Board. Reports of the event illustrate differing views. \nSome continue to claim that the financial literacy needs of most Canadian \nconsumers currently are well served by firms and existing institutional \nsupports, with only a minority of disadvantaged individuals needing support \nfrom the state to improve their financial literacy skills (Sykes 2005: 62). \nOthers reject the bifurcated model claiming that most consumers\u2014not only \nthe socially disadvantaged or financially excluded\u2014lack the skills to manage \ntheir financial affairs effectively, especially in the wake of social policies \nthat have substantially individualized responsibility for economic security \n(Canada & SEDI 2006). \n \nA 2006 report on the symposium and its implications for policy recommends \nthat the government respond to consumers\u2019 skills deficiencies by creating \n\u201can enabling environment\u201d for consumer financial capability (Canada & SEDI \n2006: 1). Defining financial capability as consisting of \u201cknowledge and \nunderstanding,\u201d \u201cskills and competence,\u201d and \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d \n(Canada & SEDI 2006: 4), the report envisages regulatory agencies including \nthe FCAC, playing an important role in fostering an enabling environment, \nbut mostly through \u201csteering\u201d rather than \u201crowing.\u201d Specifically, it proposes \nthat government agencies should facilitate \u201cstakeholder dialogue,\u201d fund \nresearch and innovation and integrate financial capability into their policies \nand programming while responsibility for program design and direct delivery \nof knowledge, skills, and responsible attitudes should remain with the private \nfor-profit and non-profit sectors (Canada & SEDI 2006: 2). \n \nAdditional support for increased state involvement in promoting financial \neducation appears in a June 2006 Senate committee report, which recommends \nincreased funding for the FCAC, development of model financial skills \ncurricula for all phases of lifelong learning, more research into consumers\u2019 \nfinancial literacy needs and better monitoring and evaluation of programmeprogram \neffectiveness (Canada. Senate Committee on Banking 2006). Proposals \nsuch as these may heighten expectations that Canadian policymakers \nwill increase the national government\u2019s role in financial literacy education \nto conform to the direction set by the OECD and perceived comparator \nstates such as the UK, the US, and Australia (e.g., Sykes 2005: 63). Large \nfinancial firms are very powerful actors in Canadian politics, however; and \nhaving marketed their own investor and consumer educational programs \nfor years, they may not be convinced that FCAC\u2019s educational activities \nsignificantly further their interests. Moreover, the centrifugal tendencies of \nCanada\u2019s federal-provincial\/territorial arrangements remain strong in the \nfinancial services sector so that proposals to strengthen a national regulator \nmay be contested. Under these conditions, substantial growth of the FCAC\u2019s \neducational project may not occur unless firms believe that public financial \neducation advances their interests in expanding demand for their products \nor in forestalling less palatable forms of consumer protection regulation. \nIV. REFLECTIONS ON THE FINDINGS \n \nA. CONSUMER SOVEREIGNTY AND THE POLITICS OF FINANCIAL \nLITERACY EDUCATION \n \nAs they have developed policy pursuant to their statutory mandates to \nimprove financial literacy skills, both the UK and Canadian regulators have \nconsistently represented financial education as empowering consumers to \nbecome more effective decision makers. Neither agency, however, perceives \nits role as confined to supplying information that the market fails to generate. \nMore evidence to support this finding appears in the FSA\u2019s policy texts than \nin those of the FCAC. Even the latter\u2019s limited program of work, however, \nembodies an implicit normative ordering of responsible behaviour by the \n\u201csmart, safe\u201d financial consumer. \n \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 14 - \n \n \nThrough the elaboration of its public education mandate, the FSA has \nsketched a bold vision of the purposes of financial literacy skills and the \nrelative responsibilities of consumers, firms, and the statutory regulator for \nthe performance of financial markets and the protection of consumers. \nAcknowledging the limitations of unskilled consumer decision-making as a \nregulatory tool, the FSA nonetheless imagines the possibility of equipping \nconsumers with the necessary confidence, habits and skills to expand their \nusage of financial products, navigate financial markets successfully and \nperform as a self-regulating regulatory actor. It also values financial capability \nenhancement as potentially dampening consumer expectations about the FSA\u2019s \ncapacity to regulate the market, expectations that the agency has tried to \ncontrol by limiting its own responsibility for the risks that consumers encounter. \nWith the deployment of consumer education as a form of consumer \nmeta-regulation, the FSA positions the \u201cconfident and capable consumer\u201d \nas a market actor whose decisions pressuring firms to innovate, compete, \nand \u201ctreat consumers fairly\u201d, help to decenter the statutory regulator. \nAs noted above, however, a decentered regulator is not necessarily \ndisempowered. Financial literacy projects such as that of the FSA rest, at \nleast in part, on the premise that without its intervention, consumers\u2019 \npreferences may be as flawed as the information on which they often rely. \nWrong or misguided preferences do not advance what regulators conceive \nto be consumers\u2019 material interests in the \u201cbusiness of life.\u201d Moreover, faulty \nconsumer preferences send the wrong signals to markets, distorting firms\u2019 \nincentives to innovate and compete. Left uncorrected, flawed preferences \nmay become political demands for the state to resume responsibility for \nindividuals\u2019 social and economic welfare, in effect, to return to \u201crowing\u201d \nrather than \u201csteering\u201d (Great Britain. FSA 2006c: 22). \n \nWhen using education to mold consumer preferences, regulators appear \nto reverse the idea of market failure posing a risk to consumer welfare, \nfocussing instead on the risk of consumer \u201cfailure\u201d jeopardizing the health \nof financial markets. Responding to this latter risk, regulators may exercise \npower in ways that conflict with standard descriptive and normative economic \nclaims about the exogeneity of consumer preferences. Responsibilized \nconsumers may be intended to regulate themselves and govern the market, \nbut they are not wholly sovereign in the sense of possessing autonomous \npreferences reflective of a unique, private conception of personal welfare. \nInstead, their goals as well as their behavior are to be fashioned by reference \nto states\u2019 interests in economic development and in the competitiveness of \ndomestic economies in global financial markets (e.g., Great Britain. DTI \n2002, 2005). \n \nAlthough a range of scholarly literatures dispute claims of the liberal state\u2019s \nindifference towards consumer preferences (e.g., Bener\u00eda 1999; Hodgson \n1999; Polanyi 2001) assumptions that the state does not interfere with \nindividuals\u2019 choices continue to influence policy on the regulation of consumer \nmarkets (Howells 2005). Indications that regulators treat preferences as \nmalleable therefore raise questions about the policy and politics of financial \neducation as a regulatory practice. One question concerns the ideological \ndimension of using individual educated choice in place of direct delivery of \nsocial welfare. In terms of relationships between the individual and the state, \nliberalism offers no clear justification for why a state willing to persuade \nindividuals to embrace responsibility for their own financial security rejects \ncollective provision funded through compulsory social insurance. The first \ninstrument purports to mold individual choices, the second to override \nthem. Neither treats consumers as wholly autonomous and the former is \nmore intrusive. Moreover, vigorous promotion of entrepreneurialism of the \nself may contribute to the erosion of solidarity as an animating principle of \nsocial policy. Impressed from their earliest days at home and in school with \nbeliefs that individuals should manage their financial affairs responsibly, \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 15 - \n \n \nrelying on private wealth for protection against risk and to fund personal \ndevelopment, future generations may find it difficult to comprehend arguments \nfor the pooling of resources to support those perceived to have failed in the \n\u201cbusiness of life.\u201d \n \nConversely, financial literacy education may potentially offer opportunities \nto challenge conventional understandings of the goals that consumers ought \nto pursue. Some regulators incorporate broad notions of consumer citizenship \ninto their financial literacy activities and differing priorities appear in states \nthat have already embarked on financial literacy education. Regulators in \ncountries of the North, for example, promote responsible usage of consumer \ncredit, but typically do not use financial literacy education to counteract \ncredit-fuelled spending, presumably because of the prominent role such \nspending plays in how those states measure economic performance. In this \ncontext, education about the management of debt may serve to preserve \nindividuals\u2019 consumer spending once employment income has stopped. South \nAfrica\u2019s financial regulator, by contrast, describes \u201cnegat[ing] the social status \nattached to consumption\u201d as a central element of its consumer education \nstrategy (South Africa. Financial Services Board 2001: 11), an approach that \npotentially may undermine contemporary consumption-driven economic \nindicators. \n \nNor should one overlook the capacity of financial education to provide a \nsetting in which to articulate alternative visions of financial justice and thus \npotentially open up new ways to participate in action for social and economic \nchange. Although in some respects emblematic of the pursuit of individual \nself-interest, money matters are also indelibly social (Zelizer 1994). Financial \nconsumption is deeply embedded in social relations of care and dependence, \nand the standardization of money as the medium of exchange creates a \nvocabulary for shared understandings of how local, national, and global \nconditions make manifest the risks and vulnerabilities of economic inequality. \nFinancial literacy provides a language and a focus for engagement with \nfinancial markets and as such potentially may offer \u201cmodel mongers\u201d of civil \nsociety a means to stimulate consumer expressions of solidarity and ethical \ncommitments around financial justice and economic relations (Braithwaite \n& Drahos 2000; Barnett et al. 2005). \n \nB. CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE LIMITS OF LEARNING \n \nAnother set of questions posed by financial literacy education concerns the \nfeasibility of its regulatory aspects, no matter how contests over consumer \nsovereignty may unfold. Research on the limits of human rationality, and \non literacies and learning exposes some of the challenges of trying to inculcate \nin consumers the habits, skills, and tastes of the responsible financial shopper. \nConsumer learning may be even more difficult to accomplish than regulators \nacknowledge because of firms\u2019 interests in exploiting ways in which consumer \nbehavior routinely departs from the assumptions of rationality assumptions \nof economic theory. Moreover, learning is a reconstitutive process that \nengages individual agency and as such, its results may be highly unpredictable. \nAttempts to responsibilize financial consumers as self-regulating regulatory \nsubjects equipped to govern the market thus may founder on the unwillingness \nof firms to subordinate their interests to those of consumers and the sheer \nungovernability of consumer decision making. \n \nBehavioral research identifies several reasoning biases that generally prevent \nconsumers from giving effect rationally to their preferences even when they \nhave access to relevant information. Of most significance to the regulatory \nproject of financial literacy education are those biases that cause consumer \nbehavior to conflict with the assumption that individuals possess stable, \ntransitive preferences that do not vary with the circumstances in which \nconsumers make their decisions. Experimental studies have shown, repeatedly, \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 16 - \n \n \nthat individuals select differently from among the same options depending \non the context of their choice and how it is \u201cframed\u201d (Bowles 1998; Hanson \n& Kysar 1999; Rabin 1998). \n \nStudies document inconsistent preferences in a wide range of different \nsettings from voting to healthcare decisions to financial services and some \nshow the persistence of inconsistencies even after individuals have been \nalerted to them (e.g., Benartzi & Thaler 1999; Kahneman & Tversky 2000). \nThese robust findings indicate that framing effects taken alone may powerfully \ninfluence consumer decisions and they may, in addition, interact with other \ncognitive limitations to influence consumer choices and responses to \ninformation remedies (Hanson & Kysar 1999: 685). Anchoring effects or \n\u201cconfirmatory biases,\u201d for example, imbue individuals with unwarranted \nconfidence in their judgments such that they fail rationally to interpret \nconflicting evidence while the availability bias leads individuals to give \ndisproportionate weight to vivid information, in effect to find it more \nmeaningful than abstract information of higher quality and greater accuracy.18 \n \nOne predictable effect of anchoring is to dilute the protective effects of \nreflection rights, since consumers who are already convinced of the suitability \nand quality of financial products they have acquired are unlikely to devote \nreflection time to rethinking their choice. The availability bias similarly may \nreduce the impact of statutory disclosure rights when firms remain free to \ncirculate their own promotional messages in more vivid and memorable \nform than the facts that law requires them to supply. \n \nCognitive limitations create incentives for financial firms to pursue increased \nprofits by systematically attempting to manipulate consumer behavior. Firms \nadopting such strategies need not attempt to change consumer preferences \nsince they can achieve their goals through product marketing that elicits \nand exploits inconsistencies in consumers\u2019 decisions and communications \nthat deflect information remedies. Once some firms deploy practices \nthat take advantage of cognitive frailties, then competitive pressures \nlikely will encourage others to follow, resulting in the structuring of market \nrelations that subordinate the \u201cmoney pump\u201d consumer to the sovereign \nproducer.19 Proponents of financial literacy education may assume that if firms can \ninfluence consumer decision-making processes so powerfully then financial \neducators also should be able to do so with well-designed interventions that \nare effectively delivered. Regulators\u2019 educational initiatives, however, must \ncontend with problems that do not trouble firms marketing their products, \nincluding the timing of feedback and a multiplicity of objectives that may \nproduce ambiguous or contradictory lessons. According to Tversky and \nKahneman, education neutralizes behavioral biases when the learner \nreceives \u201caccurate and immediate feedback about the relation between \nsituational conditions and the appropriate response\u201d (Tversky & Kahneman \n1987: 90). Neither formal educational activities nor informal learning \nexperiences such as reading popular money advice literature, speaking with \nacquaintances, or shopping readily benefit from such conditions. Regulators\u2019 \nattempts to enhance knowledge and decision-making skills may offer \nconsumers valuable resources, but typically do not provide immediate and \nsalient feedback on the relationship between a financial consumers\u2019 decision \nand its consequences. Even successful financial education may have difficulty \nin demonstrating to consumers what they have gained. Better decision making \nskills and improved knowledge may reduce the risk of a consumer obtaining \nunsuitable financial products, for example, but a consumer who steers clear \nof such products may scarcely notice the benefits of her new skill because \nshe never encounters the costs of obtaining an unsuitable product. Educators \nalso face the challenge of attempting to teach relatively complex lessons. \nWhereas firms may wish simply to entice individuals to consume their products, \nfinancial educators purport to impart a mix of skills, personal attributes, \nand information that together will produce responsible, \u201cconfident and \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 17 - \n \n \ncapable\u201d consumption. \n \nIn sum, behavioral scholarship shows that departures from the assumptions \nof rational decision-making are common, persistent, and difficult for education \nto correct. This literature suggests that in fast-changing markets that offer \nunlimited opportunities for manipulative marketing and rarely exhibit the \nconditions of effective learning, even the most intrusive consumer education \nprograms may have difficulty changing how consumers decide. \n \nWith respect to changing the preferences that consumers hold, scholarship \non literacies, learning, and cultural meanings of the consumer highlights a \nneed to interrogate assumptions about how consumers interact with learning \nwhether the lessons derive from firms, regulators, or other interested actors. \nBesides its assumptions about consumer rationality, the regulatory project \nof financial literacy education generally assumes a level of predictability \nabout what consumers learn. Equivalent assumptions about consumer \nmanageability operate in other settings: As Gabriel and Lang point out, firms \nspend vast amounts of money in attempting to manage consumers through \npromotional communications and the collection and scrutiny of data on \nconsumer behavior (Gabriel & Lang 1995). Consumer advocates worry about \nconsumers\u2019 vulnerability to monitoring and manipulation by firms and lobby \nfor laws that will provide protection. Governments reporting economic \nperformance in terms of consumer spending and anxious to reap the political \nbenefits of popular enjoyment of consumption adopt macroeconomic policies \ndesigned to manage levels of consumer \u201cconfidence.\u201d To some social critics \nthe manageability of the consumer, together with the perceived triviality, \nemptiness, or destructiveness of consumption, compares unfavorably with \nthe perceived resilience, commitments, and autonomy of their preferred \nsociopolitical identity of the citizen (Gabriel & Lang 1995). \n \nThat so much time, effort and energy is dedicated to the project of \nmanaging consumers speaks to the significance of the iconic figure of the \nconsumer in contemporary economies but the apparently unending \nnature of that project perhaps reveals more about its limitations than its \npossibilities. Gabriel and Lang\u2019s work documents the complex, fragmented, \nand unruly nature of the consumer, a figure whose behavior may exhibit a \nwide range of contradictory traits. The same consumer may act in very \ndifferent ways in similar or different settings for reasons that may be opaque \nand hence ungovernable. Integral to contemporary consumption, the \n\u201cfragmentation, volatility and confusion\u201d of consumer behavior suggests that \nconsumers may accept or reject attempts to manage them at times and in \nways that would-be managers cannot even predict, still less control (Gabriel \n& Lang 1995: 4). \n \nThese characteristics of consumer behavior may influence the reception \nof financial literacy education, some aspects of which consumers may \nembrace even as they repudiate others. How consumers interpret the meanings \nof financial education and perceive its value depends on the social organization \nof consumption and the incentives or deterrents to exercising literacy \nskills in particular contexts: such interpretations and perceptions also \nmay vary with different aspects of consumers\u2019 identities. While some literacy \ninitiatives by regulators respond to specific demographic (primarily age \nand gender) differences among financial consumers, their categories seem \ntoo limited and too rigid to contain the unruly complexity of consumer \nidentities and the \u201cvital unpredictability\u201d of consumer behavior (Gabriel & \nLang: 1995). \n \nConsumer responses to financial literacy education may be unpredictable \nand ungovernable for reasons other than resistance or the volatility of \nconsumer behavior. Learning is not a simple process of feeding fresh inputs \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 18 - \n \n \ninto an individual\u2019s intellectual database, modifying ingrained responses to \nstimuli, or adding new skills to an established cognitive foundation. Education \nis developmental and reconstitutive, centered less on what learners know or \ncan do than on the remaking of the individual. This delicate and complex \nprocess may require shedding of old certainties and beliefs, development of \na \u201ccapacity to unlearn and learn anew,\u201d and the making of mistakes from \nwhich new learning occurs (Hodgson 1999: 75). How the remaking unfolds, \nmoreover, is conditioned by the distinctive values, assumptions, and interpretive \nrepertoires by which individuals make sense of their worlds. The same \nteaching on financial literacy, then, may produce very different lessons for \none consumer than another. Contingent and variable in these and other \nways, learning may not be conducive to the disciplined channeling of \nindividual behavior embodied in the model financial consumer responsibilized \nto act as self-regulating regulatory subject. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \n \nTo conclude that the consumer may not be governable in the ways that \nfinancial regulators envisage is not to deny that better financial literacy \nskills improve the experience of financial consumption or that some types of \nfinancial education may change some kinds of consumer behavior. This \narticle has not sought to evaluate the effects of financial literacy education, \nbut rather to investigate the purposes for which regulators may deploy it. \nAnxieties about levels of consumer spending and saving are not new, but the \nsystematic expansion of financial literacy interventions by national regulators \nseems to be a distinctive contemporary development. Financial education, such \nas it is, traditionally has been delivered in private (familial, other personal, \nand commercial) settings, away from the state\u2019s gaze. Its entry onto regulatory \nagendas across the globe marks a shift in how states conceive of their interests \nin individuals\u2019 financial decisions. \n \nThis article\u2019s account of the development of the consumer education \nmandates of two financial regulators cautions against uncritical acceptance \nof claims that financial literacy education empowers consumers and advances \ntheir interests. Deficiencies in consumers\u2019 financial skills have attracted \nregulators\u2019 attention during an era when structural changes have greatly \nexpanded the supply of financial products and made financial markets more \nvolatile. In such a setting, the empowerment discourse of financial education \nmay mask a more complicated regulatory project in which education of the \nconsumer serves also to protect regulators and financial firms. Charged with \nmanaging her present consumption to provide for future needs and with \ndriving out of the market firms that are dishonest, incompetent, or indifferent \nto consumer interests, the literate or capable financial consumer becomes \nresponsibilized as a regulatory subject. This positioning of education as \nprophylactic against consumer incompetence assumes that financial \nconsumers will embrace their new learning, modifying their behavior in positive \nand predictable ways. Studies documenting the unruliness and questionable \nrationality of consumer decision-making, however, suggest that this assumption \nmay be quite unsafe. \n \nFurther research in this area should investigate the spread of financial \neducation mandates across different states, documenting differences as well \nas similarities in how regulators interpret and implement these mandates \nand the roles played by consumer groups and other non-state actors in both \ninterpretation and implementation. Such a project might draw on and \ncontribute to critical comparative scholarship on regulatory innovation and \non the diffusion of regulatory technique under globalization (Braithwaite & \nDrahos 2000; Levi-Faur 2005; Moran 2003; Scott 2004). Other useful studies \nmight interrogate the roles played by financial firms in advancing the financial \nliteracy mandates of different states. This research might relate firms\u2019 support \nfor financial education to scholarship on the role of industry in regulatory \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 19 - \n \n \ndesign and on changing conceptions of corporate social virtue (Vogel 2005). \n \nIt also should compare large financial firms\u2019 embrace of financial education \nwith their responses to explicitly redistributional measures such as legal duties \nto serve the excluded or to reinvest in economically marginalized communities. \nLastly, the use of financial literacy skills to differentiate consumers as \nwarranting varying levels of intervention raises important questions about \nrelationships between different forms of inequality and choice of regulatory \ntechnique. Policy makers\u2014and financial firms\u2014frequently target specific \neducational initiatives to consumers identified in terms of class or social\/ \nfinancial exclusion, age, gender, race, and ethnicity, but there is little critical \ninquiry into how groups become constituted as in special need of financial \neducation or the implications of such designation for consumers, regulators, and \nfirms. Investigation of these questions may further illuminate the distributional \naspects of the new regulation of consumer financial services. The novelty of \nconsumer financial education, its recent and rapid dispersion among regulators \nin states differently placed in the global economy, and the unruly agency of \nits object\/subject complicates analysis of these questions even as these same \nfactors open up a rich agenda for critical research on financial literacy \neducation as a regulatory practice. \n \nToni Williams is Associate Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School, York University \nand Chair-Elect at Kent Law School, University of Kent in the UK. Her primary research \nfields are the regulation of economic relations and the administration of criminal \njustice. Her current research agenda focuses on regulation of consumer financial services \nunder neoliberal globalization. \n \nNOTES \n \n1. The responsibilization literature cited in this article draws on the work of Michel \nFoucault, see generally, Rose (1999). \n2. Social policy scholarship features debate about whether these changes are properly \ncharacterized as \u201cretrenchment\u201d of the welfare state and about the influence of \nglobalization on domestic social welfare policies of wealthy states (Guill\u00e9n 2001; \nPierson 2001). \n3. Another firm that is prominent in advancing financial literacy is ANZ Bank in \nAustralia, which has sponsored two large-scale adult financial literacy surveys \nand supported the work of the Australian Financial Literacy Task force. ANZ \nalso runs extensive literacy programs inside and outside Australia and it recently \ncommissioned a global benchmarking assessment of its financial literacy efforts \n(ANZ Bank 2006). \n4. Meta-regulation expresses the idea of regulating consumers by acting on their \nconsciousness and of regulators using this governance of the consumer as a \ntechnique to regulate the market. This idea is analogous to Parker\u2019s account of \nmeta-regulation of firms (Parker 2002). For other models of meta-regulation, see \nMorgan (2003) and Scott (2003). \n5. There is long-standing tension between \u201cfreedom of consumption\u201d and policy \nmakers\u2019 concerns about \u201cwise spending and saving\u201d (Zelizer 1994). On the role \nof consumer sovereignty in contemporary consumer protection policy, see \nCranston, Scott & Black (2000), and Ramsay (1989). \n6. On the enlisting of non-state actors into the regulatory process, see Black (2003); \non international competitiveness as driving contemporary national economic \ndevelopment, see Porter (1990). \n7. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) acquired its statutory powers on \n30 November 2001, upon the coming into force of the Financial Services and \nMarkets Act 2000 (FSMA). It began operating in October 1997, however, when \none of the sectoral Self-Regulating Organisations (SROs) was renamed the \nFinancial Services Authority and began supplying regulatory services to the \nother SROs (which retained their statutory powers until 2001) (Briault 1999). \nThe FSA has a staff of more than 2000 and its annual budget, funded by levies \non regulated firms, exceeds \u00a3270 million (FSA 2006d: 65). \n8. In addition to its consumer protection and public awareness objectives, the FSA \nis charged with maintaining market confidence (s3), and financial crime reduction \n(s6). When developing policy the FSA must take into account the views of \nConsumer and Practitioner panels (ss9\u201311). It also must consider seven statutory \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Law & Policy, 29 (2) pp226 \u2013 256\u2019 \n- 20 - \n \n \ndecision-making factors, of which three explicitly reference competition or \ncompetitiveness: (FSMA: s2(3)(e)\u2013(g)) while other factors concern efficient usage \nof FSA resources, responsibilities of firms, proportionality in regulation, and \nmarket innovation: (FSMA: s2(3)(a)\u2013(d)) \n9. (FSA 1998: 1.3) Note that Odih and Knights suggest that responsibilization is a \nfully realized theme of the FSA\u2019s work even at this early stage of policy development \n(Odih & Knights 1999). \n10. \u201cMortgages laid bare\u201d and \u201cmoney laid bare\u201d are the first of a new breed of \nsustained, co-ordinated consumer campaigns through which the FSA seeks to \nincrease consumer engagement with financial markets and confidence about \nmoney matters. (On public communications as regulatory technique, see generally \nYeung (2005).) These campaigns target \u201canxious aspirants\u201d\u2014viewed by the FSA \nas \u201cfinancially aware enough to know they need to do something about their finances, \nbut they don\u2019t know where to start\u201d (Everitt 2006). Their imagery, in which naked \ncartoon figures hold coyly placed financial literacy messages, cries out for critical \nanalysis by someone with the appropriate skills: http:\/\/www.moneylaidbare.info\/, \nand http:\/\/www.mortgageslaidbare.info, accessed 20 July 2006. Note, by \n31 January 2007, the FSA had replaced the \u2018laid bare\u2019 sites with a single site for \nconsumer information titled \u2018Money Made Clear\u2019, www.moneymadeclear. \nfsa.gov.uk, accessed 31 January 2007.\u201d \n11. This view has been challenged repeatedly by the Financial Services Consumer Panel \n(e.g., Great Britain. Financial Services Consumer Panel 2005: 1.26\u20131.27 & 2.26). \n12. Compare the Wise Persons\u2019 Committee report, which claims that perceived \ninadequacies in enforcement may have affected confidence in capital markets\u201d \n(Wise Persons\u2019 Committee 2003: 7). At the end of 2004, the Governor of the \nBank of Canada described Canada\u2019s financial markets \u201cas more of a Wild West \nup here in terms of the degree to which rules and regulations are enforced\u201d \n(Prashad 2005; Theobald & Flavelle 2004). \n13. See OECD 2005a. In 2003 and 2005, the FCAC surveyed consumers on their \nexperiences of the agency, but neither instrument provides comprehensive \ndata on financial literacy levels. (see Fowlie 2003: appendix B); available at \nhttp:\/\/www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca\/eng\/media\/PDFs\/PublicExpFinServAwareRpt_e.pdf \n(accessed 27 February 2006). \n14. See http:\/\/www.fcac-cfc.gc.ca\/eng\/consumers\/Protection\/default.asp, accessed \n27 February 2006. Note that this communication opens with the consumer\u2019s \nresponsibilities although the FCAC\u2019s statutory objective is to promote consumer \nunderstanding of the obligations of financial firms. \n15. See http:\/\/www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca\/eng\/consumers\/resource\/default.asp. The FCAC\u2019s \nbusiness plan describes its promotion of the idea of the consumer\u2019s responsibility \nto shop comparatively as one of its significant consumer messages (FCAC \n2005a: 4). \n16. See http:\/\/www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca\/eng\/consumers\/resource\/default.asp, accessed \n1 November 2005. \n17. Risk-based approaches to regulation inform the work of some Canadian financial \nregulators. According to the BC Securities Commission, for example: \u201cA \nregulator cannot prevent all risks to investors and markets (nor should it). The \nregulator therefore needs some framework to decide when and how to apply its \nresources. At the BCSC we use a risk-based approach\u201d (Canada. BC Securities \nCommission 2005: 11). \n18. Other cognitive limitations may affect financial decision making, including \nover-optimism, loss aversion, and representativeness, see generally Bowles \n(1998), Hanson & Kysar (1999), and Rabin (1998), but framing, anchoring, and \nsalience seem particularly significant to understanding the potential effects of the \nfinancial literacy education. \n19. Coleman (1990: 633) defines money pump as \u201cany deviation by an actor from \nrational action that would lead to the possibility of that actor\u2019s being economically \nexploited by another actor who makes use of that deviation.\u201d For an earlier \ncritique of the unrealistic nature of consumer sovereignty theory in economics, \nsee Robinson (1966). \n \nREFERENCES \n \nANZ Bank (2006) Financial Literacy and Inclusion.
