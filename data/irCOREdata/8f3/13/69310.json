Introduction \n \nIn comparison to the extensive literature on the synchronic properties of passives and the \ncross-linguistic variation that they exhibit, the sources of passive constructions have received \nrelatively little attention. Consequently many questions pertaining to the developmental \npathways of passives still remain open. Chief among them is the extent to which the cross-\nlinguistic variation manifested among passives is attributable to the specificities of their \nsource constructions. It is generally assumed that some properties of source constructions are \nlikely to be lost early, others may persist longer and yet others may even be retained in well \nestablished passives. However little is known about the nature of the respective properties \nand the extent to which they are tied to a given type of source construction. Only an \ninvestigation of  the developmental stages of passives stemming from different source \nconstructions can throw light on the issue.  As documented in particular by Haspelmath \n(1990, 1994) and Giv\u00f3n & Ranch (2006), the source constructions of passives are numerous \nand varied. They include: adjectival stative (resultative) constructions, serial verb \nconstructions, causative\/reflexive\/middle constructions, nominalizations, zero anaphora, \ninverse constructions, ergative constructions and impersonal subject constructions. This paper \nwill focus on the last of these, specifically on a subtype of  impersonal subject constructions, \nnamely third person plural impersonals (3pl IMPs).    \n 3 \n     3pl IMPs are constructions with a non-referential third person plural pronominal subject \nsuch as the English they in (1) or the verbal inflection in the Polish (2a).   \n \n(1) a. They shoot horses, don\u201ft they? \n b. They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults.   \n \n(2) a. W niedziele nie przynosz\u0105    poczty.2 \n  on Sunday   not bring:3PL     mail \n  \u201c(There is) no mail on Sunday\u201fs.\u201d \n \nThey are considered to be impersonal under the functional, agent defocusing view of \nimpersonality which associates defocusing of an agent with loss of subject status and\/or lack \nof full referentiality.\n3\n The non-referential subject of 3pl IMPs is typically interpreted as \ninvolving some human collective, for instance, people in general in (1a,b) or people \nemployed by the postal service in (2a) or some other loosely specified set of individuals \nthough crucially, excluding the speaker and addressee. The exclusion of the speaker and \naddressee from the range of humans encompassed by the nonreferential subject is what \nprimarily differentiates 3pl IMPs from other impersonal constructions which express a \nnonreferential human subject such as those realized by either a pronominalized noun (e.g. \nman in German, on in French, an\/a in Hausa) or an actual person form (e.g. 1pl or 2sg). \nFormally 3pl IMPs are nearly identical to constructions with a third person plural pronominal \nas subject. Nonetheless, they can be differentiated from the latter in two respects. First of all, \nthe third person plural in the 3pl IMP lacks an overt antecedent in the preceding discourse \nwhile third person pronominal subjects are normally anaphoric. And secondly, the form of \nthe third plural is typically a phonologically or morpho-phonologically reduced form as \n 4 \nopposed to a full form. The use of a non-reduced form instead of or in addition to a reduced \none generally leads to the disappearance of the impersonal reading and the emergence of a \nstraight forward anaphoric interpretation. Note the contrast in Polish between (2a), presented \nearlier, in which the 3pl is indicated solely by the inflection on the verb as opposed to (2b) in \nwhich an independent pronoun is used in addition to the verbal person marking. \n \n(2) b. W niedziele oni  nie  przynosz\u0105  poczty. \n  on Sunday   they not bring:3PL   mail \n  \u201cThey (anaphoric) do not bring the post on Sunday\u201fs.\u201d \n \n    In languages which lack passives, 3pl IMPs are widely used as translations of the passive \nof European languages, as in the following sentences from the translation of the Bible into the \nEastern Grassfields Bantu language Limbum (3). \n \n(3) Limbum   (Nforgwei 2004: 278) \n a. A   fa        rlii       muu ene    jisos \n  3PL give    name   child that   Jesus \n  \u201cHe was named Jesus\/They named him Jesus.\u201d \n \n b. A  lor  Jisos a        vu      agho     mbo \n  3PL take Jesus 3PL:INDEF   come with      there \n  \u201cJesus was led before them\/ They led Jesus before them.\u201d \n \n \n 5 \nEven in languages which do have passives, 3pl IMPs are often used as substitutes or \nalternatives to the passive, particularly in speech. Note the following from the first volume of \nHarry Potter (Rowling 1997:71). \n \n(4)   \"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform \n should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?\" \n \n \nIn the light of the above, it is not surprising that 3pl IMPs are frequently cited as sources of \nactual passives. What is interesting though is that all the cases in point mentioned regularly in \nthe typological and grammaticalization literature are confined to only two language groups: \nNilotic (e.g. Greenberg 1959; Heine & Reh 1984:99; Heine & Claudi 1986:81; Heine & \nKuteva 2002:236-7; Payne et al. 1994) and Bantu (e.g. Giv\u00f3n 1976:180; 1979:118, 21; 1990;  \nHaspelmath 1990:49-50; Fleish 2005; Giv\u00f3n & Kawasha 2006; Kawasha 2007).  In the \nrelevant Nilotic languages the passive marker is seen to be diachronically but no longer \nsynchronically related to the 3pl subject marker.\n4\n This is illustrated in (5) on the basis of Maa \nin which we see that the person prefix cross-referencing the 3pl subject ink\u00edshu \u201ccows\u201d in \n(5a) is \/\u025b\/, while the passive suffix in (5b) is \/i\/. \n \n(5) Maa (Payne et al. 1994:301)    \n a. \u025b-t\u0254-d\u028aa     in-k\u00edshu  \u025bn-k -\u025br\u00e1y \n  3-PFV-see    PL-cows:NOM F:SG-child:ACC \n  \u201cThe cows saw the child.\u201d \n \n b. e-y-t\u00f3t-i    in- k\u00edsh\u00fa \n 6 \n  3-II-feed-PASS   F:PL-cows:ACC \n  \u201cThe cows will be fed.\u201d \n \nIn Bantu, on the other hand, the relevant passive markers are still synchronically the class \nmarkers for plural humans, as shown in (6) on the basis of Kimbundu. \n \n(6) Kimbundu (Giv\u00f3n 1976:180)     \n a.  a-     mu- mono \n     3PL     3SG   saw \n      \u201cThey saw him.\u201d \n \n b.

This is reflected in (5b) by the accusative as opposed \nto nominative case marking of ink\u00edsh\u00fa  \u201ccows\u201d. It is not so clear in (6b) due to the absence of \ncase marking in Kimbundu. However, the person prefix mu- on the verb identifies the patient \nNzua as an object. Moreover, Giv\u00f3n & Ranch (2006) are quite explicit in their treatment of \nthe Kimbundu passive as non-promotional.\n5\n Given the non-promotional nature of  these \npassives the question arises whether this is simply incidental or whether passives originating \nfrom 3pl IMPs, as opposed to those originating from other impersonal constructions, for \n 7 \ninstance reflexive or participial ones, tend not to develop into promotional passives?\n6\n The \nsecond  point of interest with respect to the passives originating from 3pl IMPs in Nilotic and \nBantu concerns the apparent rarity of the phenomenon. My investigation of the literature has \nidentified little more than a handful of potential cases of such reanalysis from outside Nilotic \nand Bantu. Yet the 3pl IMP construction is in itself highly frequent cross-linguistically. \nExamples of 3pl IMPs can be found in most branches of Indo-European, in Finno-Ugric, \nAltaic, Dravidian, Basque, in the Semitic and Cushitic branches of Afro-Asiatic, in the \nSudanic, Surmic and Nilotic  branches of Nilo-Saharan, in the Bantu and Atlantic branches of \nNiger-Congo, in various Oceanic languages,  the languages of Australia and New Guinea and \nthose of the Americas (see Siewierska 2008).  Is thus the rarity of 3pl IMP-to- passive \nreanalysis just a knowledge gap or must there be factors conducive for a 3pl IMP to undergo \nsuch reanalysis which are not often encountered? \n    The present paper will explore in some detail both of the above points, the extent to which \n3pl IMPs develop into canonical passive constructions and the reason why 3pl IMPs, as \nopposed to other impersonal constructions, appear to be such an uncommon source of \npassives. The discussion will be structured as follows.  In section 2 I will consider the \nstructural changes required in a 3pl IMP-to-passive reanalysis and the diachronic scenarios \nthat have been posited to capture them. Then in section 3 I will confront the posited \ndiachronic scenarios with the cross-linguistically attested cases of reanalysis concentrating on \nhow closely the latter approximate the passive canon. I will be especially concerned with the \nrelationship between the overt expression of the passive agent and the subjectivization of the \npatient and the structural properties which are most conducive to the formation of a fully \nfledged passive. Having established some of the structural prerequisites for the development \nof a promotional passive from a 3pl IMP, in section 4 I will take a closer look at the \nsemantics of 3pl IMPs to see whether they too may display properties which make them more \n 8 \nor less likely candidates for a reanalysis as a passive.  Section 5 will offer some concluding \nremarks.  \n \n \n2. Outlining the diachronic pathway \n \nThe degree of grammaticalization  of  a given construction can be appreciated on the basis of \nthe distance that it has traversed from the postulated source construction and the distance that \nit yet has to breach if it were to evolve into a canonical instance of what may be interpreted to \nbe the target construction. Therefore in order to be in a position to assess how far a \nconstruction has progressed along the 3pl-to-passive road we must review how 3pl IMPs \ndiffer from passives.  \n \n2.1 3pl IMPs vs. passives: the differences \n \nDetermining the differences between 3pl IMPs and passives is somewhat easier said than \ndone since, on the one hand, we know relatively little about the typology of 3pl IMP \nconstructions (but see e.g. Siewierska & Papastahthi 2008) and, on the other hand, the \nvariation among passives makes it difficult to identify the properties of one subtype as \nrepresentative of  passives per se. We must therefore proceed with a somewhat simplified \nview of both constructions. I will take as my point of reference for the passive what many \nscholars consider to be a canonical passive, i.e. a promotional passive with an overt agent. I \nwill assume that the canonical passive has the characteristics listed by Dixon & Aikhenvald \n(2000:4) in (7). \n(7)  i) applies to an underlying transitive & derives an intransitive; \n 9 \n  ii) underlying O becomes S; \n  iii) underlying A goes into peripheral function being marked by a non-core \n  case, adposition, etc, the argument can be omitted but there is  always the   \n  option of including it; \n  iv) there is some explicit formal marking generally by verbal affix or  \n  periphrastic verbal construction. \n \n I will assume a canonical 3pl IMP to be a simple active clause with a third person plural \nsubject corresponding to an unspecified human collective which has no antecedent in the \npreceding discourse.  \n     The differences between 3pl IMPs and passives that have been observed in the literature \npertain to several dimensions: semantics, pragmatics, morphosyntax, information structure, \ntext-type, register and medium. Here, however, we will concentrate only on the differences in \nargument structure, the semantic role of the subject, the referential properties of the agent and \nthe nature of the verb.  \n     With respect to argument structure, both 3pl IMPs and passives are seen to have an effect \non the same argument, namely the highest ranking argument on the semantic role hierarchy \nassociated with a given predicate, which for ease of reference I will refer to as the agent.\n7\n  In \nthe case of 3pl IMPs, like in many other impersonal constructions, this agentive argument is \nseen to be suppressed in the sense of Blevins (2003)  whereas in passives, it is seen to have \nbeen deleted  (from the syntax though not from the semantics).  That 3pl IMPs evince only \nargument suppression as opposed to reduction  is  reflected  by the fact that they behave like \nclauses with a syntactic agentive subject. Thus, for example, we see in (8a) from Polish that \nthe suppressed subject of a 3pl IMP can bind a pronominal element such as reflexive.  \n(8) Polish \n 10 \n a. W Angli        kochaj\u0105  zwierz\u0119ta         bardziej  niz    swoje    dzieci. \n  in England    love:3PL  animals:ACC   more       than  their      children \n  \u201cIn England theyi love animalsj more than theiri j children.\u201d \n \n b. *W Angli     zwierz\u0119ta         s\u0105    kochane              bardziej niz  swoje dzieci. \n  In England    animals:NOM  are   loved:PASS.PART more     than REFL   children \n  \u201cIn England animalsi are loved more than theiri children.\u201d \n \nNote that unlike in the English translation of (8a), in Polish  there is no ambiguity with \nrespect to the antecedent of the reflexive swoje; it can only be coreferential with the 3pl. \nSignificantly, as shown in (8b), the covert agent of a passive construction cannot bind a \nreflexive in Polish. Nor can it control explicit coreference in English.  \n     In relation to the semantic role of the subject, as stated above, the subject of  3pl IMPs is \nthe agent, while the subject of passives (if there is one) is precisely not the agent, which is \ndemoted, but rather the second highest ranking semantic role associated with a given \npredicate. For convenience I will refer to the semantic role of the passive subject as the \npatient.  \n    As for the referential properties of the agent in the two constructions, in 3pl IMPs the agent \nis an unspecified or only loosely specified human collective expressed by the 3pl subject \nform, free or bound. The agent of what may be considered to be a canonical passive, by \ncontrast, is not restricted with respect to its referential or semantic properties; it may refer to a \ndefinite, specific or unspecified individual or group of individuals, it may be animate or \ninanimate, human or non human and, though less common, even correspond to the speech act \nparticipants. Further it may be covert or expressed overtly, typically as an adjunct. \n 11 \n    Finally in regard to the nature of the verbs occurring in the two constructions, passives are \nconsiderably more restrictive than 3pl IMPs. Canonical passives are based on transitive verbs. \nIf passives are also formed from intransitive verbs, typically only unergative as opposed to \nunaccusative verbs are involved. 3pl IMPs only rarely exhibit transitivity restrictions and at \nleast some types can be used with any type of predicate, transitive, unergative, unaccusatve \nand even copulative (see e.g. Blevins 2003).  \n     Turning to the issue of degree of grammaticalization, in the earliest stages of what may \nultimately be a 3pl-to-passive reanalysis we may expect a clear dominance of the \ncharacteristics of 3pl IMPs as opposed to those of the passive. Overt expression of the agent \nshould be highly restricted, if permitted at all, and the patient should continue to exhibit clear \nobject properties. At a somewhat more advanced stage of the reanalysis we may expect to \nfind a greater tolerance of overt agents and\/or the acquisition of some behavioural subject \nproperties on the part of the patient. At this stage the construction in question may be \nconsidered to be an emergent passive. Once the patient has acquired the full range of relevant \ncoding and behavioural subject properties and agent phrases with few or no referential or \nsemantic restrictions have been permitted, the construction may be seen to have developed \ninto an established passive. Yet further grammaticalization may be seen to have taken place if  \nthe class of predicates involved has been restricted to unergative (as opposed to unaccusative) \nand transitive ones (see especially Blevins 2003) and conversely the properties of potential \npassive agents have been further relaxed. \n \n \n2.2 Giv\u00f3n\u201fs diachronic scenario \n \n 12 \nOne possible scenario for the above reanalysis has been sketched  by Giv\u00f3n (1976:180; \n1979:188; 1990:606) who sees the passive emerging from a blend of the 3pl IMP \nconstruction with left-dislocation of the patient. This is shown in (9). \n \n(9) a. a-      mono  Nzua \n  3PL-   saw    Nzua \n  \u201cThey saw   Nzua.\u201d \n \n b. Nzua,    a-    mu-mono \n  Nzua    3PL-   3SG saw  \n  \u201cNzua,   they saw him.\u201d \n \n c. Nzua   a-       mu-mono       kwa  mem \n  Nzua   PASS-   3SG  saw          by    me \n  \u201cNzua,  was seen by me.\u201d \n \nGiv\u00f3n argues that the emergence of a passive involves the following steps: a) a change of the \n3pl marker into a passive marker; b) the gradual acquisition of subject properties by the \npatient-topic; c) the reanalysis of the object\/topic agreement marker as a subject agreement \nmarker and d) the addition of an agent phrase. Although this diachronic scenario is widely \naccepted and has been reiterated several times by Giv\u00f3n  and taken over by numerous other \nscholars, it is by no means unproblematic. What is particularly unclear is which aspects of the \nscenario are essential and which are contingent to Bantu. Another important question \nconcerns the sequence of the posited changes. Is there a fixed sequence of changes and if so \nwhat is it? \n 13 \n     Let us consider the left-dislocation part of the scenario first. Left-dislocation involves the \nplacement of the patient at the left periphery of the clause in initial topic position and \nresumption of the patient on the verb by means of an object prefix, mu in (9b).  That a 3pl-to-\npassive reanalysis should feature some  form of topicalization of the patient is to be  expected  \nas topicalization  is a reflection of a change in information structure from that characteristic \nof 3pl IMPs to that of passives. The 3pl IMP is a construction which is essentially event \ncentred  as opposed to participant centred. The 3pl agent lacks prominence by virtue of its \nnonspecificity, while the patient lacks prominence by virtue of being an object, as opposed to \na subject, and maintaining its object position. The construction thus tends to be used to focus \non an event and not to introduce participants or further comment on them in any way. The \npassive and its corresponding active, by contrast, are participant centred; the active is agent-\nprominent, the passive patient-prominent.\n8\n The placement of the patient in topic position is \nthus a clear indication of a change from the event centred 3pl IMP towards the  patient-\ncentred passive. Nonetheless, topicality is not associated with initial position in all languages, \nmost notably not in verb-first languages in which at least subject topics happily occur post-\nverbally. Significantly, the patient is not initial in the passive in the verb-first language Maa \n(5b) cited earlier nor in Nuer (10), which is split VSO\/SVO. \n \n(10) Nuer (Crazzolara 1933: 147-8) \n c\u0254\u0254al-k\u025b      \u03b3\u00e4        e    kwaa \n call-PASS I:ACC     by  chief \n \u201cI am called for by the chief.\u201d \n \nIn fact even in Bantu placement of the object in topic position is not a necessary feature of the \n3pl-passive as evidenced by (11). \n 14 \n \n(11) Lunda (Kawasha 2007:45) \n a-      a-  nat-a              nyi-kabu  kudi  a-tu-ans \n SA-TNS-throw-FV      1-fruit     by     1-3-child-PL \n \u201cThe fruits were thrown by the children.\u201d \n \nConsequently, it is difficult to view placement of the patient at the left-periphery of the clause \nas an essential part of the 3pl IMP to passive reanalysis. This also holds for the resumption of \nthe topic by the person clitic on the verb. The presence of an object person clitic on the verb \nin Giv\u00f3n\u201fs  diachronic scenario is a consequence of the topicalization of the patient. In Bantu, \nobject fronting is always accompanied by pronoun resumption. This, however, is not \nnecessarily so in other languages.  Thus the  presence of  the object person clitic and its \nposited reanalysis as a subject is also not an integral part of the 3pl-to-passive reanalysis.  \n     What of the agent phrase? Need there be one? Most scholars working on passive \nconstructions consider an overt agent to be an integral part of the passive, as reflected in the \ncharacteristics of the canonical passive listed earlier in (7).\n9\n  And indeed since no simple \npredicate may occur with two agents, other than coordinated ones, the presence of an overt \nagent in a would-be 3pl IMP construction provides clear evidence that the 3pl marker has \nbeen or is in the process of being reanalysed as a passive marker. In the absence of an agent, \non the other hand, a Verb-3pl NP  construction such as (9a) is potentially three-ways \nambiguous between: (i) an active transitive construction with an anaphoric third plural \nsubject, (ii) a 3pl IMP construction and (iii) a non-promotional (impersonal)  passive.  If the \npatient is already topicalized, as in (9b), this three-way ambiguity is reduced to two-way \nambiguity; the 3pl IMP reading is likely to disappear leaving the anaphoric and non-\npromotional passive readings. At this stage, the appearance of the possibility of agent \n 15 \nexpression would again fully disambiguate the construction. Further it might be argued that \nthe presence of an overt agent is also likely to speed up the acquisition of more subject \nproperties on the part of the patient, i.e. the development of the non-promotion passive into a \npromotional one. \n     I have just suggested that in the 3pl IMP-to-passive reanalysis the emergence of an agent \nphrase is likely to precede the full subjectivization of the patient.  This is also what is implicit \nin Giv\u00f3n\u201fs diachronic scenario or rather in the Kimbundu example that he gives, namely (9c). \nAlthough the patient is here in initial position, since (9c) is a non-promotional passive we \nmay assume that the patient continues to exhibit the syntactic behaviour of objects rather than \nsubjects. Morover, there is no indication that the mu-prefix has been reinterpreted as a subject \nprefix. The agent, by contrast, is a first person one. The presence of a first person agent is \nvery telling.  It is a reflection of the enormous distance that (9c) is likely to have travelled \nfrom its source construction, the 3pl IMP. Recall that the agents of 3pl IMPs are non-singular \nand unspecified. The agent in (9c) is not only singular and specific but a first person. Thus we \nmay conclude that either agent phrases develop more quickly than subjects in passives \nderived from 3pl impersonals or that the Kimbundu example, which has epitomized the \nposited reanalysis for the last twenty-odd years, is very atypical. \n    Having considered the differences between 3pl IMPs and passives and the potential \ndiachronic pathway that the former need to take in developing into the latter, let us now \nconfront our theoretical speculations with  the actual instances of this change that have been \nidentified in the literature. \n \n \n3. Degree of grammaticalization: a cross-linguistic view  \n \n 16 \nAs mentioned earlier, my scrutiny of the literature for potential instances of passives \noriginating from 3pl IMP constructions has identified very few cases in point. The most \npromising are in the languages listed in (12), which also includes some of the previously \nmentioned Bantu and Nilotic languages. \n \n(12)   Coptic (Layton 2004:135-7, Reintges 2004, 2008a,b) \n Itelmen (Georg & Volodin 1999:164) a Chukato-Kamchatkan language \n        Vitu (van der Berg 2006) a Western Oceanic language of Papua New Guinea \n Creek (Martin 2000) and Seminole (Nathan 1977:124), Koasati (Kimball 1991:138), \n  three Muskogean languages\n10\n \n Lakhota (Pustet & Rood 2008) and Omaha (Eschenberg 2005), two Siouian languages  \n Cavi\u0148ea (Guillaume 2004: 258; 269), a Tacanan language of Bolivia  \n Kaqchiquel (Broadwell & Duncan 2002), a Mayan language \n Bantu: Kimbundu, Luvale, Lunda, (Horton 1949:88; Giv\u00f3n & Kawasha 2006;  \n  Kawasha 2007)  \n Nilotic\n11\n: Maa (Payne et al. 1994; Heine and Reh 1984: 99; Heine and Claudi 1986: \n 80), Dholuo (Tucker 1993:436), Nuer (Crazzolara 1933: 147-8) \n  \nIn virtually all of the above languages the 3pl origins of the respective passive markers is \nexplicitly mentioned or even discussed by the cited authors. I will refer to the languages in \n(12) as \u201ethe sample\u201f. In what follows I will consider the relevant passive constructions in \nthese languages focusing on how they fare with respect to Giv\u00f3n\u201fs diachronic scenario and \nespecially on how advanced they are on the road to becoming fully established passives.  \n \n3.1 Nature of the verb \n 17 \n \nLet me begin with the least complicated issue, the nature of the verbs which may occur in the \nrelevant constructions. In the Nilotic languages there appear to be no restrictions on the \nnature of the verbs used; transitive, intransitive, both unergative and unaccusative, stative, \nand basic and derived verbs all occur. By way of illustration consider the examples in (13) \nfrom Maa. \n \n(13)   Maa (Payne 2008) \n a. e-ibel-it\u201fo-i \n  3-rock-PROG-IMPV \n  \u201eIt is being rocked from side to side.\u201f \nb. e-d\u0254-i \n 3-be red-IMPV \n \u201e(People) are red.\/ Being red happens.\u201f \n \nc. e-ta-wuas-atek-i \n 3-PFV-pride-PFV.PL-MID-IMPV \n \u201cPeople were\/became proud.\u201d \n \nBy contrast, in Lunda, Kaqichel and Vitu only transitive verbs appear in the 3pl-passive. \nWhether this is also the case in Coptic, Itelemen, Luval and Kimbundu I have not been able \nto establish. The only examples given by the respective authors involve transitive verbs. In \nCreek, Martin (2000:388) suggests that agentive predicates are clearly favoured though the \nissue requires further investigation. Kimball (1991:138) is quite explicit about the \nconstruction being used only with transitive verbs in Koasati. In Lakhota (Pustet & Rood \n 18 \n2008:729) there appears to be a restriction to semantically highly transitive verbs. And in \nCavine\u0148a all the verbs found in the ta\/taana-construction are transitive with the exception of \nthe verb maju \u201cdie\u201d (Guillaume 2008).  Thus with respect to the semantics of the verbs found \nin the 3pl IMP\/passive construction, for most of the languages in question a passive analysis \nseems viable. \n     \n \n3.2 Agent expression \n \nTurning to the agent phrase, among the languages in the sample there is a good degree of \nvariation with respect to agent expression. No agent is permitted in Vitu, Creek, Koasati \nSeminole, and Cavine\u0148a.  In Maa, Dholuo and Lakhota the possibility of agent expression \nseems to be dependent on the age of the speakers. Agent phrases occur occasionally in the \nspeech of the younger generation, as illustrated in (14) from Lakhota, which is attributed by \nthe respective authors to the influence of Swahili and English in the case of Maa and Dholuo \nand English in the case of Lakhota.  \n \n(14) Lakhota  (Pustet & Rood 2008:738)  \n Igm\u00fatha     h\u00e9          s\u00faka      theb-\u00d8-y\u00e1-pi. \n mountain lion   that:SG   dog       STEM-3SGP-eat up-PASS \n \u201cThat mountain lion was eaten by a dog\/the dog.\u201d \n \nBoth singular and plural nominal though not pronominal agents are regularly found in \nItelemen (see 19b further below), Coptic, Lunda (10) and  Luvale. In Coptic in fact even a \nnon-human, but animate agent is possible, as illustrated in (15). \n 19 \n \n(15) Coptic (Reintges 2004:227) \n kan e\u0283t\u0283e \u0259nt-a=u:-tarp\u0259=s   hi-t\u0259n-ne-th\u025brion \n or if REL-PFV=3PL-carry.away-3FSG by-hand-DEF.PL-animal \n \u201cor whether she had been carried away by wild animals (\u2026)\u201d  \n    \nIn addition to nominal agents pronominal third person ones  are attested in Nuer (16).  \n \n(16) Nuer (Crazzolara 1933:135) \n c\u00e0a\n12\n  jooc   \u00e8   k\u025bn \n PAST:PASS 3SG:put to flight by them \n \u201cHe was put to flight by them.\u201d \n \nAnd finally all types of agents, even  1st and 2nd person ones can be overtly expressed in  \nKimbundu (8c) and the ki-passive in Kaqchikel (17).\n13\n \n \n(17) Kaqchiuel (Boadwell & Duncan 2002:4) \n Rin x-     in-ki-tz\u201fet    aw-oma\u201f  rat \n I     COM-1ABS-PASS-see     2SE-by   you \n \u201cI was seen by you.\u201d \n \n  \n3.3 The encoding of the patient \n \n 20 \nWith respect to the subjectivization of the patient, the evidence from morpho-syntactic \nencoding, i.e. word order, case and agreement, is with one partial exception, either negative \nor inconclusive. The patient in the relevant constructions manifests clear object encoding in \nMaa, Nuer, Creek, Seminole, Dholuo, Itelmen and Coptic. In the first four languages the case \nmarking of the patient is unequivocally accusative or oblique and the word order is \ninconclusive, the languages being either verb-initial or final. In addition in Maa and Nuer the \npatient, unlike a subject, exhibits no verbal person marking. In Creek and Seminole the \nperson marking is inconclusive with respect to grammatical relations as the markers for the \nthird person are zero while the first and second person forms exhibit active alignment and \nthus the same forms are used for a patient S as for the O. The oblique marking of a NP patient \nin the ho-passive is illustrated in (18) from Creek and the object-like marking of a second \nperson patient S (19a) and of a patient in the ho-passive is shown in (19b) from Seminole. \n \n(18) Creek (Martin 2000:388) \n oymo  lki-n  yaha-n  akal-ho.y-in \n boiling water-OBL wolf-OBL pour on-IMP:PL-LGR-DS \n \u201cThey pour boiling water on Wolf.\u201d \n \n(19) Seminole (Nathan 1977:124 \n a. ci-pi\u014bk\u00e3:l-a\u014bk-\u00e3: \n  2SG-frightened-PAST-INTER \n  \u201cWere you frightened?\u201d \n \n b. ci-hi:st\u014f-ho:y-im\u00e1c \n  2SG-see-PASS-past:DEC \n 21 \n  \u201cYou were seen long ago.\u201d \n \nItelmen and Dholuo have no case marking of core arguments  but the verbal person marking \nof the patient identifies it as an object.\n14\n Compare, for example, the Itelmen (20a) and (20b).   \n \n(20) Itelmen (Georg & Volodin 1999:164) \n a.

Order is thus not a good indicator of grammatical relations. \nIn Itelmen though the patient is clause initial, since the language is essentially SOV, the \npatient would normally be preverbal irrespective of its S or O status. The word order is thus \nalso inconclusive as far as the grammatical relation status of  the patient is concerned. In \nCoptic, by contrast, which is SVO and in which verbal person marking of the object is in \ncomplementary distribution with a co-occurring corresponding free form the word order and \ncase marking or the agreement marking identify the patient as an object.  The object \nagreement marking of the patient by means of the third person singular feminine enclitic can \nbe seen in (15) cited earlier. The non-nominative case marking which is by means of a \n 22 \npreposition and the postverbal placement of the pronominal patient in the 3pl IMP is \nillustrated in (21), which is in fact the clause preceding (15) in the given text. \n \n(21) Coptic (Reintges 2002:227) \n kan e\u0283t\u0283e \u0259nt-a=u:-aikhmal\u0254tize  \u0259mmo-s hi-t\u0259n-n\u0259-\u00dfarbaros \n or if REL-PFV=3PL-enslave  PREP-3FSG by-hand-DEF.PL-barbarian \n \u201cor whether she had been enslaved by the barbarians (\u2026)\u201d  \n \nSplit encoding of the patient, i.e. with some object-like and some subject-like characteristics \nis found in Luvale, Lunda, Kimbundu and Vitu. In Kimbundu the initial placement of the \npatient may be seen as a reflection of subject encoding while the verbal person marking is \nthat of an object. In Luvale and Lunda this is also so but for the fact that the patient may be \npostverbal.  In Lunda, though not Luvale, such postverbal patients, if inanimate, do not \ntrigger object marking on the verb.  In Vitu which is also an SVO language like Luvale, \nLunda and Kimbundu, the patient in a passive clause though typically preverbal, as in (22), \nlike in Luvale and Lunda may occur postverbally.\n15\n  \n \n(22) Vitu (van den Berg 2006: 9) \n Goloa kua e  koha-nga na desk \n thing this REALIS:3 call-PASS ART desk \n \u201cThis thing is called a desk.\u201d \n \nUnlike in the other three languages, when preverbal, the patient determines the agreement on \nthe verbal auxiliary, when postverbal the agreement is necessarily third person singular.\n16\n  \nThe preverbal placement and ability to determine agreement marking is in line with subject \n 23 \nstatus, the postverbal placement and default third person singular agreement  is in line with \nobject status. In the case of nominal singular patients such as goloa kua in (22) only the word \norder is suggestive of the grammatical relation of the patient since the agreement is the same \nirrespective of whether the patient is preverbal or postverbal.  In Lakhota, Omaha, Cavine\u0148a \nand Kaqchikel the encoding of the patient does not provide any evidence of its grammatical \nstatus. In Lakhota and Omaha there is no overt case marking and the verbal person forms \nwhich are overt only for the first and second person exhibit split active alignment, as in Creek \nand Seminole. In the so called pi-passive for those speakers who allow for the overt \nexpression of the agent, the patient necessarily precedes the agent, as shown in (13) given \nearlier. Since the transitive order with nominal participants is typically SOV, the location of \nthe patient before that of the agent may be seen as indicative of subject encoding. However, \nas agents are permitted only by younger speakers and are in any case rare, the location of a \npatient nominal is typically not really suggestive of its grammatical relation. When the patient \nis a speech act participant, which is acceptable only for some speakers,  the verbal person \nforms used in the pi-passive are those of the undergoer. This is illustrated in (23). \n \n(23)  Lakhota (Pustet & Rood 2008:716) \n H\u00e9chel ap\u00e9tu kil   \u00e9    \u00e9l   w\u00f3\u201foyaka waz\u00ed    oy\u00e1g-ma-si-pi.   \n so        day    the  this on  story         a          tell-1SGO-ask-PASS \n  \u201cToday I was asked to tell a story.\u201d \n \nThe undergoer encoding of the patient is also unrevealing with respect to its S vs. O status \nsince due to the split-active alignment, the patient would receive undergoer marking \nirrespective of whether it is an S or an O. The encoding of the patient in the ta\/tana-passive in \nCavine\u0148a, illustrated in (24), is equally uninformative.  \n 24 \n \n(24) Cavine\u0148a (Guillaume 2004: 258)  \n Kashi-\u00d8                 ara-tana-ya. \n sweet.banana:ABS           eat-PASS:IMPFV \n   \u201cSweet bananas are eaten.\u201d  \n \nThe language has ergative case marking, also ergatively aligned bound person markers on the \nverb in complementary distribution with free forms for the S and O  and rather flexible word \norder.  The patient can occur both preverbally as in (24) and postverbally as in (25) and thus \nits placement provides no evidence of its grammatical relation. \n \n(25) Cavine\u0148a (Guillaume2004: 264) \n A-tana-wa=  e kwe    e-kwer   [e-buji=ekatsje]s \n affect-PASS-PFV 1SG:DAT 1SG-GEN  1-nephew-DUAL \n \u201cMy two nephews got killed!\u201d \n \nNor is the grammatical relation of the patient deducible from the case marking or the \npresence of a bound person form on the verb as the patient is in the absolutive and if \npronominal will be bound to the verb irrespective of whether it is an O or an S.  Kaqchikel, \nlike Cavine\u0148a, exhibits morphological ergative alignment though only in verbal agreement \nnot in case marking which is absent.  Accordingly, the fact that the verb in the ki-passive \nexhibits evident absolutive agreement with the patient, indicated by the \u2013in- prefix in (17)  \nearlier above, tells us nothing about whether the patient is an O or S. The word order in the \nlanguage is flexible and thus also provides no clues as to grammatical relations. Nonetheless, \nit is worth pointing out that in all the examples provided by Broadwell & Duncan (2002) the \n 25 \npatient in the ki-passive is clause initial. Finally in Koasati, unlike in Creek and Seminole, the \npatient occurs with nominative rather than with oblique marking, as shown in (26).  \n \n(26) Koasati (Kimball 1991:138) \n a. th\u00e1tka-k  ho-banna-tikko-laho-y \n  white person-NOM PASS-need-3NEG(3CI)-IRREALIS-TERMINAL MARKER \n  \u201cWhite people will not be needed.\u201d \n \n b. ittili-ho-cobak-k ho-ci-m\u00e1nka-Vhco-k k\u00e1,h,ha-n \n  eye-DISTR-big-NOM PASS-2SG-call-HABIT-SS say:H.GRADE-DS \n  \u201cYou are called Big Eyes.\u201d \n \nThe agreement marking is split active, as in Creek, Semiole, Lakhota and Omaha with \ntypically zero marking for third person and active for first and second. However in the case of \nverbs belonging to the 3Ci conjugation such as banna \u201cneed\u201d in (26a) there is overt \nagreement marking of subjects in the third person in negative clauses. Thus in (26a) not only \nthe case marking but also the agreement marking identifies th\u00e1tkak as the S as opposed to the \nO.  The agreement marking of  first and second person patients, however, is inconclusive \nsince the undergoer prefixes are used as shown in (26b), just as in Creek and Seminole. \n     The possibilities discussed above of  type of verb, agent expression and the extent to \nwhich the patient exhibits subject encoding are summarised in Table 1. The label \n\u201einconclusive\u201f abbreviated to \u201eincl\u201f is used when the location or marking of the patient could \nbe viewed as either S or O marking. The +\/-, on the other hand, indicates variant encoding \n 26 \none of which is associated with S marking and one with O marking. ? stands for lack of \ninformation. \n  \n    Table 1 \n                              Verb type, agent expression and subject encoding characteristic of the \n patient in the 3pl passives in the languages in the sample \n  \n Verb Ag 3 \nHuman \nAg Non-\nHuman \nAg 12 Subj \norder \nSubj agr Subj case \nMaa all (+) - - incl - - \nDholuo all (+) - - incl - - \nNuer all + - - incl - - \nCoptic Tr? + + - - - - \nKimbundu Tr? + ? + + - irr \nLunda Tr + + - +\/- - irr \nLuvale Tr? + ? - +\/- - irr \nCreek Ag - - - incl incl - \nKoasati Tr - - - incl incl\/+ + \nLakhota Ag (+) (+) - incl incl irr \nCavi\u0148ea Tr 1intr - - - incl incl incl \nKaqchikel Tr + + + incl incl irr \nItelmen Tr + - - incl - irr \nVitu Tr - - - +\/- +\/- irr \n \n \n 27 \nWe see in Table 1 that in the languages in the sample the most common change in encoding \nthat the patient undergoes relative to its object characteristics in the projected 3pl IMP source \nconstruction is with respect to order. This is fully in line with the topicalization aspect of \nGiv\u00f3n\u201fs diachronic scenario. In four of the SVO languages the patient in the passive \nconstruction  is either necessarily initial (Kimbundu) or tends to be initial (Luvale, Lunda and \nVitu). There are two languages in which there is a partial change in the agreement marking of \nthe patient, Vitu and Koasati. And there is one language in which the patient manifests a \nchange in overt case marking, Koasati. These differences suggests that of the three subject \nencoding properties, word order is acquired prior to agreement and case marking. However, \nwe have no clear evidence for the relative order of acquisition of case and agreement \nmarking. It has been repeatedly noted in the literature (see e.g. Cole et al. 1978; Malchukov \n2005, 2007) that case marking is an encoding property which tends to lag behind that of both \nagreement and word order. Our findings with respect to the encoding properties of patients in \nthese 3pl-based passives do not, however, confirm this. In the languages which display both \ncase marking and agreement marking, either there is no change in marking or in one, Koasati, \nsubject case marking is acquired in full while subject agreement marking only in part, i.e. for \nthird person subjects. The data are, however, too sparse to allow us to draw any \ngeneralizations. \n     What Table 1 also reveals is that the possibility of overt agent expression tends to emerge \nearlier than morphological subject encoding of the patient. This again conforms to the \nexpectations of Giv\u00f3n\u201fs diachronic scenario. All the languages but for the Muskogean, \nCavi\u0148ea and Vitu display some possibility of agent expression. By contrast, in only two \nlanguages in the sample, Koasati and Vitu, does the patient acquire morphological coding \nproperties which would allow one to unequivocally identify it (under some circumstances) as \na subject.  \n 28 \n \n3.4. The behavioural properties of the patient \n \nAs reflected in Table 1, in terms of coding properties only in five of the languages in the \nsample do the patients in the relevant passives qualify as subjects. Coding properties, \nhowever, are not the only diagnostics of the nature of grammatical relations. In fact most \nscholars consider syntactic behaviour as more revealing of grammatical relations than coding  \nproperties. The consensus seems to be that on the whole coding properties tend to lag behind \nsyntactic ones (see e.g. Keenan 1976; Giv\u00f3n 1979: 235-268; Cole et al. 1980; Malchukov \n2005). If this is so the possibility arises that even in some of the languages in which the \npatient does not display unequivocal subject encoding properties or even manifests accusative \ncase and\/or agreement it has already acquired some subject behavioural properties. \nUnfortunately, I have not been able to determine to what extent this is indeed so since for \nmost of the languages in the sample there is no data on the syntactic behaviour of the patients \nin the relevant constructions. The only syntactic information that I have relates to Maa, \nLunda, Cavine\u0148a and Kakchiquel. \n     The i-passive in Maa is a poor candidate for a promotional passive since not only is the \npatient clearly marked like an object but also the construction displays no restrictions with \nrespect to verb type. And indeed according to  Payne (2008) the patient exhibits no syntactic \nsubject properties but rather behaves like an object. One example of this is with respect to the \ncontrol of number agreement on the infinitive. In Maa an infinitive agrees in number with the \nsubject of a preceding fully inflected verb. We see in the non-impersonal (27a), for example, \nthat the infinitive of \u201ctry\u201d takes the plural \u00e1a- prefix in agreement with the first person plural \nsubject of the preceding progressive. In the impersonal (27b) we find the same plural prefix \n 29 \non the infinitive which reveals that the agreement is with the unspecified 3pl and not the \nsingular patient \u201chouse\u201d. \n \n(27) Maa \n a. \u0190k\u00ed-gur\u00e1    \u00e1a-jo   m\u00e1-ta-yiol\u00f3  i-r\u00f3rei l\u0254\u0254 \n  1PL-PROG INF:PL-try SUBJN-SUBJ-know PL-words:ACC M:PL:ACC \n  1-M\u00e1\u00e1s\u00e2\u00ee \n  m-Massai:pl:acc \n  \u201cWe are trying to learn about Massai word.\u201d  \n \n b. \u0190-gir\u00e1-i    \u00e1a-un  \u025bnk-aji \n  3-PROG-PASS INF:PL-erect F:SG-house:ACC \n  \u201cThe house is being erected.\u201d  \n \nLunda, on the other hand, is more promising. In this language, according to  Giv\u00f3n & \nKawasha (2006) and  Kawasha (2007), the patient displays two behavioural subject \ncharacteristics, but also other clearly behavioural object properties. The first of the two \nsubject characteristics is the ability to function as the controlee of co-reference in certain  \npurpose clauses illustrated in (28).  \n \n(28)  (Giv\u00f3n & Kawasha 2006:28) \n a.

While subject \nrelativization involves the placement of a relative clause marker immediately after the subject \n(30a), when the object is relativised a relative prefix agreeing in number and noun class with \nthe head noun is placed in the first prefix position, the subject person marker is suffixed \n 31 \nrather than prefixed to the verb and the subject is located postverbally rather than preverbally \n(30b). \n \n(30) a.

Compare (30b) with (30c). \n \n c. chisalu ch-aa-mona-wu kudi Mary \n  mat 3SG-PAST-see-3PL by    Mary \n  \u201cthe mat that was seen by Mary.\u201d \n    \nTurning to Cavine\u0148a, according to Guillaume (p.c.) the syntactic evidence with respect to the \nstatus of the patient in the ta\/tana-passive is inconclusive. While there is some evidence that \nit behaves as a subject with respect to coreference between a matrix clause and one type of \ndependent clause, this does not hold in all cases. Further investigaton is in order to determine \nthe exact conditions under which the subject-like behaviour obtains and when it does not.  \nFinally in Kakchiquel the patient behaves like a subject with respect to subject oriented \n 32 \nrelational NPs such as  rik\u2019i rurayb\u2019\u00e4l \u201cbecause of his\/her desire\u201d. As demonstrated in (31) in \nthe case of both a normal transitive clause (31a) and the standard passive (31b), rik\u2019i \nrurayb\u2019\u00e4l  modifies the subject. \n \n(31) Kakchiquel (Broadwell & Duncan 2002) \n a.

This complementizer can be omitted \nonly if the subject of the embedded clause is the same as that of the matrix clause, as is the \ncase in (32a) and also (32b) in which the embedded clause is a standard passive.  \n 33 \n \n \n(32) a.

Thus, we have one \nlanguage Kaqichel, in which a 3pl IMP appears to have developed into a fully promotional \npassive and potentially two, Cavine\u0148a and  Lunda, in which a non-promotional passive is \nwell on the way to becoming a promotional one. If morphological properties do indeed lag \nbehind the syntactic, one may well expect a patient which has actually acquired a \nmorphological property of subject to also display some behavioural subject characteristics. \nWe can therefore add Koasati to our set of languages with a promotional passive also in terms \nof syntactic behaviour. Another  good candidate for  being on the way to a promotional \npassive, is the one in Vitu. Recall that the patient in Vitu when preverbal determines verbal \nagreement. However, Van den Berg admits that he has not yet had the possibility of \ninvestigating whether the patient does indeed exhibit any syntactic subject properties.   \n \n \n3.5 Factors conducive to the 3pl-to-passive reanalysis \n \nOur investigation of the degree of grammaticalization of passives originating from 3pl IMPs \nhas revealed that such passives may evolve into fully promotional ones. They may even \nevolve into what is typically considered to be a canonical passive, i.e. a promotional passive \nwith an expressed agent. Only one of the constructions in the sample has achieved the status \nof a canonical passive, namely the Kaqichel  ki-passive. The corresponding construction in \nKoasati is promotional but agentless, that in Cavine\u0148a is not fully promotional and agentless, \nthe one in Lunda is not yet fully promotional and the construction in Vitu is both necessarily \nagentless and not fully promotional. The canonical aspects of the Kaqichel ki-passive \nnotwithstanding, it continues to bear traces of its 3pl origin, namely: the agent must be \nanimate and the subject cannot be generic or third person plural. The standard passive in \n 35 \nKaqichel has none of these restrictions. The animacy constraint on the agent of  the ki-passive \nmay be viewed as the last vestige of the humanness constraint of the unspecified subject of \n3pl IMPs. The constraint against generic subjects may be seen to follow from the lack of \ntopic-worthiness of a generic patient and thus the unlikelihood of such patients feeding into a \npatient-prominent construction such as the passive. And the constraint against third plural \nsubjects is attributable to the still existing homophony between the passive ki and the 3pl \nergative verbal person marker.  \n     Given that only one of the 3pl IMP-based passives that have been attested in the literature \nhas developed into a canonical passive, we may well ask what factors are conducive to this \nrare development.  \n     In relation to the subjectivization of the patient a facilitating factor is clearly the lack of a \nmorphological distinction between the O and S, i.e. no case marking or non-accusative case \nmarking and non-accusative agreement marking.\n18\n Needless to say in the absence of any \nmorphological marking distinguishing the O from the S, it is much easier to interpret a patient \nas a subject than if the patient bears marking associated with object status. This is especially \nso if the patient is located in a designated and clearly identifiable subject position, such as the \npreverbal in a SVO language or post-verbal in an OVS one or alternatively if there are no \ndesignated positions in a language for either the subject or the object. Kaqichel has no case \nmarking, and it has ergative agreement marking and flexible order. It thus fully complies with \nall three of the above conditions. So does Cavine\u0148a with its ergative case and ergative bound \npronouns and flexible order and also in part Lakhota which has no case marking and active \nagreement with zero forms for the third person. The glaring exception to the above is Koasati, \nwhich has overt case marking which distinguishes the S (and A) marked by \u2013k from the O \nmarked by \u2013n. However, the fact that Koasati is the only language in the sample and the only \none of  the three Muskogean languages considered here in which the patient has acquired \n 36 \nsubject case marking may also be seen as confirming the confounding role of case marking in \nthe subjectivization process. Further none of the other languages in the sample in which the \n3pl-passive is well on the way to becoming a canonical one, i.e. the Bantu languages Lunda, \nLuvale nor Kinyarawanda have overt case marking.  All do, however, have overt object \nagreement marking of the patient as does also Itelmen.  While object agreement on the part of \nthe patient does not appear to preclude the patient from acquiring some behavioural subject \nproperties, it is an obstacle with respect to the acquisition of full subject encoding properties \nsince the object agreement markers must either be reanalysed as subject agreement ones or be \ndropped and replaced by subject agreement markers. The first possibility leads to the \ndevelopment of  a new subject agreement marker paradigm specific to passive subjects and \nhomophonous with that of the object. Interestingly, there do not appear to be any actual \ninstances of this having taken place. I am not aware of any language in which the subject \nagreement markers used in the passive but not those used in other intransitive clauses \ncorrespond to those of the object agreement ones. The second possibility seems more likely \nparticularly if the object person markers are not obligatory in the language. It might have \noccurred in Vitu, for example. It is not clear whether Vitu had object clitics or suffixes  at the \ntime when the allomorph of the passive suffix, -(a)nga was attached to the verb. It currently \nhas object suffixes, but these do not occur with non-singular pronouns and in some other \ncircumstances. If it did, the object clitics were dropped either before or after -(a)nga  was \nreanalysed as a passive marker.  Significantly, as exemplified earlier in (21), subject \nagreement  markers are attached not to the verbal stem to which -(a)nga  is attached but are \nfused with aspect, mood and sequentiality markers in a preceding auxiliary. That overt \naccusative marking of the patient constitutes an impediment not only to the patient acquiring \nthe encoding properties of subjects but even behavioural subject properties is suggested by \nMaa. While Maa need not be representative of the status of patients in all the other languages \n 37 \nwith accusatively marked patients it is of interest to observe that in all of the languages in \nquestion, namely Coptic, Dholuo, Maa, Creek and Seminole even the location of the patient \nis either different from that of the subject (Coptic) or not unambiguously identifiable as that \nof the subject. In sum, the data stemming from our investigation suggests that the type of \nmorphological marking in a language conducive to the subjectivization of the patient can be \ncaptured in the hierarchy in (33). \n \n \n(33) no case or non-accusative    >       no case & accusative   >   accusative case & \n case and\/or agreement        agreement                        any type of agreement                  \n \n    As for the development of an agent phrase, recall that the presence of an overt agent is an \nunequivocal indication of the reanalysis of the 3pl IMP as passive.  Accordingly the \npossibility of agent expression may be seen as facilitating the further grammaticalization of a \nconstruction into a fully fledged passive. However, unlike in the case of the subject, there are \nno morphosyntactic properties of the relevant constructions which may be taken as conducive \nto the emergence of an overt agent.\n19\n The factors which appear to be relevant lie outside the \nactual constructions in question. These factors are the existence of other passive constructions \nwith overt agents in the language and\/or contact with languages which have salient agentive \npassives. Kaqichel, as illustrated in (31b)  and (32b), has another passive, in fact, two other \npassives, in addition to the ki-passive which permit overt agents. Lunda, and presumably also \nthe other two Bantu languages mentioned here, still has the pan-Bantu passive formed with \nthe affix \u2013(ib)w\/-(ig)w which, as shown in (34), allows for overt agent expression.  \n \n(34) Lunda (Kawasha 2007:38) \n 38 \n anvw\u00e1li a-di-in-i        a-swezha   ku-lem-ish-ew-a \n CL2-parent  SUBJ-TNS-be-R.PAST-FV    SUBJ-exceed INF-be-important-PASS-FV \n k\u00fadi a-nt\u00fani   na-\u00e1wu \n by  CL2-neighbor with-PRO2 \n \u201cThe parents were highly respected by their neighbors.\u201d  \n  \nThe ancestor of Coptic, Ancient Egyptian, had as many as three passive constructions, which \nReintges (2008a) refers to as the internal, suffixal and reduplicative passives, respectively. \nAll three allow for the expression of an agent, as illustrated in (35).  \n \n(35)         Ancient Egyptian      (Reintges 2008a:36, 16) \n a. wb\u0294-(w)  \u0283 mn\u0295    jn   Mrjj-n(j)-R\u0295 pn \n  open.PFV-PASS lake nurse  FOC Meri-ri-Re DEM.N:SG \n  \u201cThe canal of the nurse was opened by king Meri-nj-Re here.\u201d \n \nb.  \u222bzp-t(j)  \u0295 =f                  jn   nt\u222br     \u0295 \u0294  \n  take.PFV-PASS  arm=POSS:3M:SG    FOC  God great \n  \u201cMay his arm be taken by the great God.\u201d \n \n c. \u0283zpp  \u0295=f   jn R\u0295 \n  take:PASS arm=POSS.3SGM FOC Re \n  \u201cHis arm will be taken by (the sun god) Re.\u201d \n \n 39 \nMoreover, Coptic itself has a periphrastic passive construction involving the auxiliary verb t\u0283i \n\u201cto take\u201d which may occur with an agent phrase, as is the case in (36). \n \n(36)   Coptic (Reintges 2004:228) \n a=i-t\u0283i-s\u00df\u0254     \u0259n-- n\u0259-k\u0254t   \u0259m-p\u0259-nute \n PFV=1SG-take-teaching  PREP-DEF.PL-precept link-DEF.MSG-god \n \n e\u00dfol hi-toot=u   \u0259n-hen-noky  \u0259n-telios \n PCL through-hand=POSS.3PL as-INDEF.PL-great link-PERFECT \n \u201cI was taught (lit. I received teaching) in the precepts of God by great perfect ones.\u201d \n \n     According to the sources consulted, there are no alternative agentive passives in the other \nlanguages in the sample. In the case of Itelmen, the presence of the agent phrase could be \nattributed to the influence of Russian as the language, like all Chukotko-Kamchatkan \nlanguages, has been under heavy influence of Russian, which not only has a reflexive and \nperiphrastic passive which permit agents but also employs 3pl IMPs on a regular basis (Ard \n1978:223).\n20\n  As mentioned earlier the influence of Swahili and nowadays also English, is \nseen to underlie the development of an agent phrase in Nilotic. And  the emergence of an \nagent phrase among the younger generation of Lakhota speakers is attributed by Pustet & \nRood (2008) to English. Why the same hasn\u201ft happened in the Muskogean languages, the \nremaining speakers of which are also bilingual in English is impossible to say. The speakers \nof Vitu know English as well but according to van den Berg (2006:3), the language is used \nmainly in the community school and only rarely in everyday situations, the lingua franca \n 40 \nbeing Tok Pisin. As for the speakers of  Cavine\u0148a, some clearly do know Spanish, but \nbilingualism does not appear to be widespread.  \n      In this section I have suggested some local, morphosyntactic features and some more \ngeneral ones which may speed up the reanalysis of a 3pl IMP construction into a promotional \npassive and even a canonical passive. But we have yet to address the issue of what underlies \nthe reanalysis in the first place and, crucially, why it is far less common than the cross-\nlinguistic distribution of 3pl IMP constructions would lead one to expect. \n.  \n \n4. Types of 3pl impersonals \n \nAn issue which has been entirely ignored in the previous discussions of the 3pl-to-passive \nreanalysis is the type of 3pl IMP constructions that might serve as an input to the reanalysis. \n3pl IMPs are by no means all alike. They have been classified in terms of whether i) the \nconstruction provides any means of identification of the referent of the subject, ii) what sort \nof referent identification is provided, iii) the nature of the referents involved and iv) the \ngeneric vs. episodic nature of the specified event.\n21\n Although I have been referring to all of \nthese as 3pl IMPs, some are more impersonal than others. Consider, for instance, the \nexamples of 3pl IMPs in (37), which following Cabredo Hofherr  (2003, 2006)  I will refer to \nas the universal (37a), corporate (37b), vague (37c) and specific (37d) uses of the 3pl IMP, \nrespectively. \n \n(37) a) In Spain, they eat dinner late.  \n b) They changed the tax laws last year.    \n c) They\u201fve found his bike in the back of a barn.   \n 41 \n d) They\u201fre inviting us to a party. \n \nBoth the universal (37a) and corporate (37b) differ from the vague (37c) and specific (37d) \n3pl IMPs  in identifying the nature of the group to which the referent of the subject belongs, \nnamely the people in Spain in (37a) and the government in (37b). No such identification of \nthe referent of the subject is provided in (37c) or (37d). Constructions such as (37a) and (37b) \nare therefore termed by Langacker  (2006) semi-impersonal as opposed to the full impersonal \n(37c) and (37d).  The two semi-impersonal constructions differ from each other with respect \nto how the referent of the subject is identified. In the universal the identification is by means \nof the locative phrase, in the corporate via the lexical effects stemming from the verb and its \narguments. Further the universal differ from the other three types of impersonals in not being \nanchored in time. Unlike the corporate, vague and specific 3pl IMPs, the universal  do not \ndenote a specific event but rather a general truth or a property and as such resemble generics. \nThe major difference between the two full impersonals, the vague and specific, is that the \nformer indicate only that an event has taken place without any indication of the precise point \nin time when it occurred whereas the specific necessarily indicate a concrete point in time, \ngenerally the time of speech. Further while the actual event depicted in the vague 3pl IMP \ncould have been performed by a single individual (e.g. the bike in (37c) could have been \nfound by a single person), it is only in the case of the specific impersonal that the given \nindividual is precisely a specific one, i.e. someone identifiable by the speaker (e.g.  in the \ncase of (37d) a colleague in the French department). As shown in (38) from Italian, the \nindividual in question can even be someone subsequently identified as known not only to the \nspeaker but also to the hearer. \n \n(38) Italian (Cinque 1988: 543) \n 42 \n Prima  hanno    telefonato;   mi      pareva tua sorella \n   earlier have:3PL telephoned;    me   seemed your sister \n \u201c(* Someone)\/they telephoned earlier. It seemed to be  your sister.\u201d \n \nAnother type of impersonal is that found with typical speech act verbs such as say or tell, as \nin (1b) in section 1 which I repeat in (39). \n \n(39) They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults.  \n \n I mention this type as it is often the only example of a 3pl IMP cited in reference grammars. \n      Of the above types of 3pl IMPs neither the universal nor the impersonal with speech act \nverbs constitutes a promising source of passives; the universal is restricted in its generic \nusage and the  patient in speech act verbs is too abstract to warrant being treated as topical \nand thus to justify reanalysis. The other three types of impersonals are more promising inputs \nto a passive reanalysis. I suggest that such a reanalysis is, however, not tied to the existence \nof any single one of these three types of 3pl IMPs but rather is conditional on the occurrence \nof all three in a language. My motivation for this claim is that all the 3pl IMP constructions \nthat are undergoing a passive reanalysis that I am aware of exhibit very few restrictions with \nrespect to the referential properties of the agent. A wide variety of possible agents is \nsomewhat unexpected if the input to the respective reanalyses were to be just any one of the \nthree type of 3pl IMPs but is fully commensurate with the properties of all three. Together the \nthree types of impersonals  allow for a wide spectrum of agents: a loosely identified group \n(corporate), a fully unidentified group or individual (vague) and a specific individual \n(specific), even one well known to the addressee. If we accept the above reasoning and take \nthe existence in a language of all three types of 3pl IMPs, the corporate, vague and specific, \n 43 \nto be a precondition for a passive reanalysis, we may have the beginning of an explanation \nfor why passives originating from 3pl  IMPs are not as common a phenomenon as one might \nexpect. Although 3pl IMPs are widely distributed cross-linguistically, the three types may not \nco-occur all that often. \n     The investigation of 3pl IMPs in the languages of Europe conducted by Siewierska & \nPapastathi (2008), the only cross-linguistic investigation of 3pl IMPs  I am aware of,  reveals \nthat corporate and vague impersonals are quite widely attested, but the specific ones are \nconsiderably less so.  Their study, based on the acceptability judgements of 132 native \nspeakers of nine European languages elicited by questionnaire, reveals that 3pl IMPs are \ncompletely acceptable, in Spanish, Italian, Greek and Hungarian, especially under the \nspecific indefinite as opposed to the definite readings. By contrast 3pl specific IMPs are \ncompletely unacceptable in French and at best marginal in English, Dutch, German and \nPolish. These findings are shown in figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 represents the acceptability \njudgments of the use of a 3pl IMP with an underlying indefinite specific referent (e.g. a \ncolleague from the French department) and figure 2 with an underlying definite referent (e.g. \nyour sister, as in (38)). The number of speakers tested for each language is as follows: \nDutch=14; English=10; French=19; German=17; Greek=17; Hungarian=16; Italian=9; \nPolish=16; Spanish=14. \n \n \n \n                               \n 44 \n \n0.00%\n20.00%\n40.00%\n60.00%\n80.00%\n100.00%\n120.00%\nD\nut\nch\nE\nng\nlis\nh\nG\ner\nm\nan\nFr\nen\nch\nP\nol\nis\nh\nIta\nlia\nn\nS\npa\nni\nsh\nG\nre\nek\nH\nun\nga\nria\nn\n \n                                                 Figure 1 \n  High acceptability ratings of specific 3pl IMPs; the referent is subsequently \n  identified as being specific indefinite, e.g. a student \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 45 \n \n0.00%\n10.00%\n20.00%\n30.00%\n40.00%\n50.00%\n60.00%\n70.00%\n80.00%\n90.00%\n100.00%\nD\nut\nch\nE\nng\nlis\nh\nG\ner\nm\nan\nFr\nen\nch\nP\nol\nis\nh\nIta\nlia\nn\nS\npa\nni\nsh\nG\nre\nek\nH\nun\nga\nria\nn\n \n \n \n                                                  Figure 2 \n  High acceptability ratings of specific 3pl IMPs; the referent is subsequently \n  identified as being definite, e.g. your mother  \n \nOf course findings based on European languages cannot be assumed to automatically hold for \nlanguages in other parts of the world.  But nor can they be dismissed unless there are good \nreasons to suggest that they are somehow specific to the languages of Europe. There are no \nsuch reasons in the case of 3pl IMPs.  On the contrary. It is hardly surprising that it is \nprecisely the  individual and specific reading of the referent of a 3pl IMP that is less common \nthan the group and unspecified one as the individual specific reading is the furthest removed \nform what is normally associated with the third person plural.  My contention that such an \nindividual and specific reading provides a stepping stone to a passive reanalysis is more \n 46 \ncontroversial. It does, however, account for the fact that all of the languages which allow for \nan overt agent in the relevant passives permit specific and definite agents. Moreover, it is not \ndifficult to imagine how exactly the specific reading should feed into the passive reanalysis, \nnamely via predicates used to depict events which are primarily or at least often patient- \nrather than agent-centred. In English and many other languages one such predicate is to bear \nin the sense of  \u201eto give birth\u201f which is more often than not used in the passive to be born. In \nthe absence of a passive construction the 3pl IMP is an alternative, as in (40) through (42).  \n \n(40) Omani Arabic: Hidd dialect (Holes 1998:359) \n Wlidoni  fi  l-\u201fuzal \n give birth:3Pl  to:1SG in Uzal \n \u201cThey gave birth to me in Uzal.\u201d \n \n(41) Ewe (Heine and Reh 1984:99) \n Wo-dzi    Kofi \n 3PL-bear   Kofi \n \u201cThey bore Kofi.\/ Kofi was born.\u201d \n \n(42) Lewo (Early 1994:323, 324) \n Pogos napa    a-   si      yemerava \n     TIME  REL       3PL-create   world \n     \u201cWhen they [God] created the world.\/When the world was created [by God].\u201d \n \nOnce the 3pl IMP is used in a language for a clearly patient-centred event with this one \npredicate, the door is open for the construction to be extended to other predicates.  Whether it \n 47 \nis thus extended will undoubtedly depend on a multiplicity of factors. The existence of a 3pl \nspecific IMP in a language is just one of them, but a crucial one. \n     In sum, a 3pl IMP to passive reanalysis is dependent on the existence in a language of a \nvariety of 3pl IMP constructions among which is the specific 3pl IMP.  It is this type of 3pl \nIMP which provides the stepping stone for a passive reanalysis via its use in constructions \ndepicting  patient-centred events involving individual and specific agents, the prime example \nof which is to be born. And once a 3pl IMP is used in constructions depicting such events, as \nis the case in (40) to (42), it may be viewed as an incipient passive. \n \n \n5. Concluding remarks \n \nIn embarking on this investigation I set out to answer two main questions, whether  passives \nbased on 3pl IMPs ever develop into promotional and even canonical ones and why the 3pl-\nto-passive diachronic pathway appears to be such a rare source of passive constructions. In \nrelation to the first issue, we have seen that passives originating from 3pl IMPs do indeed \ngrammaticalize into promotional and even canonical passives, be it infrequently.  The full \nsubjectivization of the patient is most likely in languages in which bound morphology does \nnot constitute an obstacle to reanalysis, i.e. in languages which make no morphological \ndistinction between the O of a transitive clause and the S of a passive one, namely languages \nwhich manifest neutral, ergative or active as opposed to accusative morphological alignment. \nThe possibility of overtly expressing an agent does not appear to have any morphosyntactic \ncorrelates but rather to be tied to the existence of alternative agentive passives in a language \nor to contact with languages which have such passives. In either case it is possible to detect \nthe influence of analogy. That 3pl IMPs may be sources of promotional passives especially in \n 48 \nlanguages with ergative and active morphological alignment is of special interest as such \nlanguages are normally seen as disfavouring or even lacking passive constructions. The \nreanalysis of 3pl IMPs has not been previously considered as a potential source of passives in \nsuch languages.   As for the second issue, the infrequency of passives originating from 3pl \nIMPs  relative to the cross-linguistic commonality of 3pl IMP constructions, I have argued \nthat not all 3pl IMPs are equally likely sources of passives. 3pl IMPs which are essentially \nused in generic contexts and\/or are restricted to speech act verbs are not promising inputs to \nreanalysis. Reanalysis requires that 3pl IMPs be used  in episodic contexts and with different \ntypes of agents, among them  individual and specific ones. In other words, reanalysis is \npredicated on high grammaticalization of the 3pl IMP construction itself. If  such highly \ngrammaticalized 3pl IMPs are not that frequent cross-linguistically, as the European data of \nSiewierska & Papastathi (2008) suggest, then we may have an explanation why 3pl IMPs are \nnot as frequent a source of passives as one might expect.  Whether this is indeed so, only \nfuture reasearch can determine. \n     In considering the above, I also subjected to scrutiny the diachronic scenario involved in \nthe 3pl-to-passive reanalysis as posited originally by Giv\u00f3n and subsequently assumed in \nmuch typological and cross-linguistic work. I hope to have shown that the diachronic changes \nposited are in the main contingent to the nature of Bantu and languages with similar morpho-\nsyntactic characteristics rather than intrinsic to the reanalysis per se. It appears that the only \nfactor common to all the cases of reanalysis that I have managed to identify is the reanalysis \nof the 3pl marker as a passive marker. None of the other aspects of Giv\u00f3n\u201fs scenario, left-\ndislocation of the patient, development of an agent phrase and reanalysis of an object person \nmarker as a subject one are necessary, though they may reflect different stages of a \ngrammaticalization path in individual languages. The first two aspects, left-dislocation and \nagent expression, do indeed often occur but are independent of each other; there are \n 49 \nlanguages in which the patient is topicalized but do not allow for the possibility of an overt \nagent (e.g. Vitu), languages in which there is overt agent expression but no patient \ntopicalization (e.g. Coptic), languages which have both (e.g. the Bantu) and languages which \nhave neither (e.g. Maa). The third aspect of Giv\u00f3n\u201fs scenario reanalysis of the object person \nmarker as a subject one has yet to be documented.  In the languages where full \nsubjectivization of the patient appears to have taken place (Koasati, Kaqichel and potentially \nCavine\u0148a) there has been no need for reanalysis of the object marker by virtue of the ergative \nor active alignment manifested by the languages in question. In the Bantu languages, the \nreanalysis does not yet appear to have taken place.  We can assume that it has occurred when \nwe see the Bantu object prefixes in the relevant passive clauses being used like typical \nsubject ones, i.e. not only as anaphoric pronouns or resumptive pronouns in left-dislocations \nbut as subject agreement markers with overt, especially first and second person subjects, and \neven focal ones. In outlining his diachronic scenario of how 3pl IMPs develop into passives \nGiv\u00f3n appears to have been sketching a possible pathway not a blue-print. It is time this be \nrecognised and variations on the scenario be seriously explored. \n \n \n \nReferences \nArd, Josh 1978. \u201cSubject-based and Absolutive-based Syntactic Processes in Kamchadal\u201d. \n Lingua 45: 193-231. \nBavin, Edith 1989. \u201cThe ki-verb Construction in Acholi.

I would like to express my gratitude to Bernard Comrie and \nMartin Haspelmath  for inviting me and enabling me to utilise the resources of  the Institute. \n2\n The following abbreviations are used in this paper: A=transitive subject; abs=absolutive; acc=accusative; \ncl=classifier; dat= dative; dec=declarative; def= definite; DS=different subject; e=ergative; fem=feminine; \nf=feminine; gen= genitive; FV=final vowel; indef=indefinite; impfv=imperfective; inter=interrogative; \nlgr=lower pitch grade (a form of the stem); m=masculine; n=neuter; nom=nominative; O= object; obl=oblique; \npart= participle; pass=passive; pfv=perfective; pl=plural; prep=preposition; prog=progressive; R.past=remote \npast; refl=reflexive; rel= relative marker; S=intransitive subject; sg=singular; subj=subject; tns=tense. \n3\n 3pl Imps  may also be considered to be impersonal under the subject-centred view of impersonality if \nimpersonality is associated not with the lack of a subject, which is typically the case, but rather the absence of a \ncanonical subject, under the understanding that only referential subjects are canonical (see e.g. Creissels 2007; \nSiewierska 2008). \n4\n The \/i\/ suffix in Maa can, however, be interpreted as still conveying plurality in certain constructions. See \nPayne et al. (1994) for discussion. It also needs to be pointed out that  there is some unclarity whether the origin \nof the current passive marker was a 3pl form or just a plural form used in the third person. Greenberg\u201fs \n(1959:173-174) original analysis involved the latter.  \n 53 \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \n5\n It needs to be noted that in earlier publications (see e.g. Giv\u00f3n 1976;180; 1979:188; 1990:606) Giv\u00f3n strongly \nimplied that  the Kimbundu passive was a promotional one. Only more recently has its non-promotional nature \nbeen acknowledged, especially in comparison to that of Lunda, to be discussed further below. \n6\n The development of reflexive and participial impersonals into full promotional passives and also of passives \nback into active impersonals especially in Romance, Slavonic and even Scandinavian languages has been much \ndiscussed. See, for instance, Sanso (2009), Lavine (2005) and Maling and Sigurj\u00f2nsd\u00f2ttir (2002). \n7\n According to Cinque (1988) in the case of the so called existential 3pl IMPs the argument in question is \nnecessarily agentive but not in the case of the so-called generic or universal  3pl IMPs. \n8\n The patient prominent nature of the passive holds for what is usually taken to be the canonical construction as \ncharacterized in (7). In languages which have several passives, some may diverge from this canon as discussed \nand illustrated, for example, in Sans\u00f3 (2006). \n9\n A notable exception is Shibatani (1985) who omits the agent from what he takes to be the passive prototype. \n10\n The relevant marker in question in the Muskogean languages is  -ho-\/oh which was considered a 3pl marker \nby Hass (1946) but is now  variously analyzed, as a distributive marker in Koasati by Kimball (1991: 136), an \nimpersonal plural by Martin (2000) and simply a passive by Nathan (1977:124). Whether it should be \nconsidered as an actual third person plural, even diachronically, is not clear. I have included the relevant \nconstructions for completeness. \n11\n The constructions which I am considering as potential passives in the Nilotic languages are typically viewed \nas \u201cpassive equivalents\u201d. Most  take the  prefix or suffix \/i-;-i\/ or \/ki-;-ki\/. Languages other than those mentioned \nin (9) which also exhibit this suffix include: Acholi (Bavin 1989), Arusa (Levergood 1987:40-1), Kalenjin \n(Toweet 1979: 234-239) and Lotuko (Heine and Claudi 1986: 81). \n12\n  The passive - k\u025b suffix has been dropped here. It is only indicated by the tone on the stem. According to \nCrazzolara (1933:147) such  dropping of the passive suffix is frequent. \n13\n Kaqchikel has two other passive constructions in addition to the ki-passive, which will be illustrated further \nbelow. \n14\n The agreement marking in Itelmen, as in other languages of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan family, is somewhat \ncomplex, the prefixal forms being determined by the subject and the suffixal by the object and also intransitive \nsubject. However, the actual phonetic form of the suffixes for the intransitive subject and object is different, at \nleast for the first and second person. The system is sometimes seen as a special type of split ergative alignment \n(see e.g. Bobaljik 2000). \n15\n The passive marker in Vitu has three allomorphs, vowel mutation, replacement of verbs ending in a  \u2013Ci \nsuffix by a-Ca suffix  and addition of the suffix \u2013(a)nga. Only the last of these allomorphs is diachronically \nrelated to a 3pl. An (a)nga suffix is still used as a pluralizer for the third person in the very closely related \nlanguage Bali.  \n16\n Van den Berg gives very few examples of passives with the suffix \u2013(a)nga in Vitu all of which feature a \npreverbal nominal singular patient.  Therefore, I cannot illustrate the discussed difference in agreement. It is not \nabsolutely clear whether the difference in question has been observed with passives marked by the -(a)nga \nallomorph. \n17\n This example is somewhat less convincing than it could be due to the fact that there is no actual 3pl- passive \nmarking of the infinitive. This is understandable if the 3pl is still a person marker, but not if it is already a \npassive, which is what the presence of the agent phrase suggests. \n18\n I am assuming that the 3pl-to-passive reanalysis requires the 3pl marker to be bound to the verb. Therefore in \nthis scenario I have disregarded the possibility of a language having no agreement. \n19\n Given that both patient topicalization and the overt presence of an agent are indications of a departure from a \nnormal 3pl IMP construction, one might expect agent phrases to be particularly likely in languages in which the \npatient does not change its location in the passive. Yet this does not appear to be so. \n20\n The presence of the agent phrase in Itelmen may also be at least partially attributable to the influence of the \nother Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages, all of which, apart from Itelmen display ergative case marking; the \nlocative\/instrumental marking of the agent is very reminiscent of the ergative marking of the transitive subject. \n21\n An overview of the typologies of 3pl Imps that have been proposed in the literature and a detailed explanation \nof the alleged  types is provided in Siewierska & Papastathi (2008). \n \n \n \n"}
