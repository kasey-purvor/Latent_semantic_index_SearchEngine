Researchers have been looking into the\nemergence of new monetary forms: for example, \u2018\u2018complementary cur-\nrencies\u2019\u2019 (Bowring \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738; Fitzpatrick and Caldwell \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731; Latouche \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730;\nLee \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736; North \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733) and internet or electronic monies\n(Pahl \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739; Singh \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736, \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737, \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730). This research is supported\nby the work of Cohen (\uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734), Helleiner (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733) and Hart (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730),\nwho predict that the relationship between money and the state is coming\nunder increasing threat from these new monetary forms. But for all the\nempirical richness that these recent contributions add to our under-\nstanding of money, they have further complicated what was already\nsomething of a conceptual muddle. This muddle has arisen because\nthere is no common view of what counts as \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 in a more general\nsense. There never has been a consensus about this: the extant literature\non money is replete with debates over competing definitions. But now,\nperhaps for the first time, some scholars are suggesting that there is no\nfeasible definition of money which can embrace the diversity of mone-\ntary forms in circulation. It seems that the problem today is not that we\ncannot agree on a definition of money, but rather that no single definition\nof money will suffice. \u2018\u2018Money\u2019\u2019, it would appear, is disintegrating. The\nterms of the present debate suggest that any attempt to build a coherent\ntheoretical conception of money is bound to fail.\nMy aim in this paper is to attempt a careful assessment of the analy-\ntical implications of this purported disintegration of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019. The\npaper is in four sections. In the first, I examine the diverse nature of\n\uf733\uf738\uf737\nNigel D\uf76f\uf764\uf764, London School of Economics, Department of Sociology, London\n[n.b.dodd@lse.ac.uk.].\nArch.europ. sociol.,XLVI,\uf733 (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735),\uf733\uf738\uf737-\uf734\uf731\uf731\u2014\uf730\uf730\uf730\uf733-\uf739\uf737\uf735\uf736\/\uf730\uf735\/\uf730\uf730\uf730\uf730-\uf738\uf730\uf733$\uf730\uf737.\uf735\uf730perart+$\uf730.\uf731\uf730perpage\u00a9\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735A.E.S.\nmoney. Until recently, the world\u2019s monetary system was dominated by\nnational currency. This domination is now held to be in decline due to\nthe growth of private monetary forms such as \u2018\u2018electronic money\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018alternative currency\u2019\u2019. I ask whether these developments really do jus-\ntify claims about the \u2018\u2018de-territorialization\u2019\u2019 of money. In the second\nsection, I interrogate Ingham\u2019s argument that states have an essential\npolitical function in relation to money that cannot be superseded by\nprivate corporations or community associations. I demonstrate that\nwhile Ingham provides an insightful analysis of state-issued currency,\nhis argument is flawed as a general approach to the nature of money. In\nthe third section, I utilise the distinction between currency and money to\nevaluate the arguments of Zelizer and Hart, who have both sought to\naccount for the \u2018\u2018multiplicity\u2019\u2019 of money. Although they agree that\nmoney is a diverse phenomenon, there are some important differences\nbetween their approaches. Zelizer advances a phenomenological account\nof the multiple meanings of money. Hart goes further, arguing that\nmoney is diverse as an entity. To conclude, I propose how these various\napproaches might be reconciled around a generic \u00a2 but essentially fic-\ntional \u00a2 concept of money.\nBreaking-Up Money\nThe so-called disintegration of money can be described in a number\nof ways, depending on how one defines \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019. Broadly speaking, it is\npossible to distinguish between three kinds of money that now circulate:\ncurrencies that are issued by a state (or group of states); forms of money\n(usually consisting of e-money) that are issued and managed by corp-\norations; and forms of money that are issued by local communities.\nThere is widespread agreement among sociologists, anthropologists and\ngeographers that the second and third categories have grown in their\nsignificance during the past decade. There is also some consensus that\nthis growth could undermine the integrity of a global monetary system\nthat is managed primarily by governments. But these two developments\n\u00a2 the growth of alternatives to currency on the one hand, and the decline\nof state control over the world\u2019s monetary system on the other \u00a2 tend to\nbe grouped together as part of an underlying trend towards the \u2018\u2018de-\nterritorialization of money\u2019\u2019. I argue that they are best treated separately.\nPractically and conceptually, each raises distinctive sociological ques-\ntions.\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf733\uf738\uf738\nThe phenomenon of \u2018\u2018de-territorialization\u2019\u2019 has been explored by\nCohen in two widely-cited books as well as in numerous articles on the\n\u2018\u2018changing geography of money\u2019\u2019. According to Cohen, we are witness-\ning the decline of what he calls \u2018\u2018pure territorial money\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u2018Pure terri-\ntorial money\u2019\u2019 refers to money that is used solely and universally within a\nparticular national territory. It is issued by state decree, and controlled\nby agencies acting on behalf of the state. Increasingly, major currencies\nare circulating beyond their territorial borders. Moreover, some weaker\ncurrencies are being encroached upon and are even disappearing from\ncirculation altogether. In some respects, the issues raised by de-territo-\nrialization are not new. \u2018\u2018Weak\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018soft\u2019\u2019 currencies have been around\nfor a long time. The difficulty of controlling a currency that circulates\nbeyond the territory in which it is legal tender has been apparent at least\nsince the oil-driven growth of \u2018\u2018euro-dollars\u2019\u2019 during the mid- to late-\n\uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s. In any case, one should not exaggerate the extent to which\ngovernments have been free at any point to manipulate monetary policy\nin the face of international pressures and other economic complexities.\nNevertheless, there is some justification for claiming that the problem of\ncurrency management for states has deepened during the past twenty\nyears or so. There are three main reasons for this deepening: first, the\nliberalization and subsequent expansion of international money and\nfinancial markets; second, the increasing use of major currencies beyond\nthe legal jurisdiction of their respective authorities, whatever the prefe-\nrences of governments; and third, the increasing incidence of \u2018\u2018dollari-\nzation\u2019\u2019, (where a government chooses to adopt a foreign currency in\nplace of its own) (\uf731).\nCohen\u2019s analysis of the de-territorialization of money hinges on what\nhe calls a \u2018\u2018revival of currency competition\u2019\u2019. This revival has been\nspurred by financial markets, which enable banks and corporations to\nchoose from a range of national currencies. Increasingly, governments\nare unable to \u2018\u2018preserve the exclusivity of their currencies\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018cur-\nrency choice is... becoming the rule\u2019\u2019 (Cohen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf738). According to\nCohen, currency competition has led to two interrelated phenomena:\ncurrency internationalization, and currency substitution. Currency inter-\nnationalization occurs when a major currency (such as the US dollar)\n(\uf731) Monetary sovereignty might also have\nbeen recently undermined for another reason\nthat is partly related to the issues just men-\ntioned. Monetary unions and currency boards\nare partially motivated by the desire of\ngovernments to bolster their own monetary\narrangements against the perceived power and\napparent autonomy of financial markets. In\naddition to the euro, there are three other cur-\nrency unions in existence: in the East Carib-\nbean (established in \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf735), the CFA Franc\nZone (\uf731\uf739\uf736\uf732-\uf731\uf739\uf736\uf734) and the Common Monetary\nArea (\uf731\uf739\uf738\uf736). Both of the latter are African. In\nall, thirty-five countries worldwide currently\nbelong to a currency union (Cohen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734,\np. \uf736\uf734).\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf733\uf738\uf739\ncirculates beyond the legal jurisdiction of its issuing authority. Currency\nsubstitution \u00a2 or what is sometimes called \u2018\u2018dollarization\u2019\u2019 \u00a2 takes place\nwhen a minor currency is encroached upon, and even replaced\naltogether, by an internationalized currency. In effect, currency inter-\nnationalization and currency substitution constitute \u2018\u2018a sort of\nGresham\u2019s-Law-in-reverse... a Darwinian process of natural selection,\ndriven above all by the force of market demand\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf739). The\nconsequence of these two processes is that the monetary landscape is\nbecoming increasingly stratified. Cohen illustrates this through an anal-\nogy with a pyramid, which is \u2018\u2018narrow at the top, where the strongest\ncurrencies dominate; and increasingly broad below, reflecting varying\ndegrees of competitive inferiority\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf731\uf734) (\uf732).\nCurrency internationalization and currency substitution are only\nindicative of a dilution of monetary sovereignty, and not of its complete\nerosion. Nevertheless, this prospect gives rise to two possibilities. One\npossibility is that fewer and fewer currencies will circulate, as the world\u2019s\nmonetary system evolves towards a hypothetical state in which only one\ncurrency \u00a2 controlled by an institution such as a world central bank \u00a2\nexists. This possibility has been explored, and is indeed advocated, by\nMundell (\uf731\uf739\uf736\uf738). Cohen (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf732\uf736) concedes that the \u2018\u2018one world, one\nmoney\u2019\u2019 scenario is attractive if one takes demand-side considerations\ninto account: \u2018\u2018efficiency considerations suggest a preference for as small\na population of monies as possible\u2019\u2019. However, the situation is more\ncomplex on the supply side. States are likely to seek to retain their power\nover currency in order to continue receiving the benefits that such\ncontrol yields for macroeconomic policy: seniorage, political symbolism,\nand monetary insulation (ibid., pp. \uf732\uf730-\uf732\uf734) (\uf733). Thus, according to\nCohen, the \u2018\u2018streamlining\u2019\u2019 of the world\u2019s monetary system that is sug-\ngested by the processes of internationalization and currency substitution\n(\uf732) In Cohen\u2019s view, the pyramid consists of\n\u2018\u2018top currency\u2019\u2019, which is most widely accepted\nbeyond its borders (formerly the pound, now\nthe US dollar), \u2018\u2018patrician currency\u2019\u2019, which is\nused for cross-border transactions, but not on\nsuch a wide scale (e.g. the euro and yen), \u2018\u2018elite\ncurrency\u2019\u2019, which is used internationally but\nhas a limited international influence (e.g. ster-\nling, Swiss franc, Australian dollar), \u2018\u2018plebeian\ncurrency\u2019\u2019, which enjoys a very limited inter-\nnational use (e.g. the currencies of Norway,\nSweden, Israel, South Korea, Taiwan,\nKuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates),\n\u2018\u2018permeated currency\u2019\u2019, whose domestic com-\npetitiveness has been compromised through\ncurrency substitution (e.g. currencies in Latin\nAmerica, former Soviet Bloc, Southeast Asia),\n\u2018\u2018quasi-currency\u2019\u2019, which has been superseded\nnot only as store of value but also as unit of\naccount and medium of exchange (e.g. the\ncurrencies of Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Cambodia,\nLaos, Peru), and \u2018\u2018pseudo-currency\u2019\u2019, which\nexists in name only (e.g. the Panamanian bal-\nboa) (Cohen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, pp. \uf731\uf734-\uf731\uf736).\n(\uf733) He also argues that the most likely\ncorollary of the idea of a world currency, i.e. an\ninstitution along the lines of a world central\nbank, is unrealistic: the governments that are\nresponsible for the major currencies such as the\nUS dollar and the euro are unlikely to accept\nsuch a proposal (Cohen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, pp. \uf732\uf731\uf731-\uf732\uf731\uf734).\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf733\uf739\uf730\nwill be offset by a combination of domestic pressures and market forces.\nThe world\u2019s monetary system is changing quite radically. But it will be\ncharacterised by a rise, not a fall, in the diversity of money (ibid., p. \uf736\uf730).\nIn Cohen\u2019s view, it is the increasing diversity of the world\u2019s monetary\nsystem that presents the greatest potential difficulties to governments.\nState-issued currencies are facing competition not only from each\nother, but also from a growing range of monetary forms which are not\nissued by states, such as electronic money and complementary curren-\ncies. Cohen argues that the diversity of money is likely to increase by\nvirtue of this new competition. Electronic money, or e-money, is most\noften used in specialised payment networks as an incentive for regular\ncustomers. Prominent examples of these monetary forms include air\nmiles (\uf734) and supermarket loyalty schemes. Corporate incentive sche-\nmes are becoming more sophisticated, powerful and far-reaching. In\nBritain, one recent example of this development is the \u2018\u2018Nectar\u2019\u2019 scheme.\nThis incorporates companies in a range of different sectors, such as\nSainsbury\u2019s (groceries), Barclaycard (credit cards), Vodaphone (mobile\nphones), BP (petroleum), Hertz (car hire) and E-Energy (electricity and\ngas). The points that consumers accrue can be converted into air miles,\nused online to buy consumer durables and package holidays, or\nexchanged for entry into theme parks and cinemas. The Tesco \u2018\u2018Club-\ncard\u2019\u2019 \u00a2 the main rival to that scheme \u00a2 is integrated into the super-\nmarket\u2019s financial arm, which offers a full range of retail banking servi-\nces.\nIf electronic money is having a growing impact on \u2018\u2018mainstream\u2019\u2019\nmoney-flows, there are grounds to suspect that the state\u2019s predominance\nin the control of money is also being undermined in a more localised\nsense. \u2018\u2018Complementary\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 currencies include LETS\n(Local Exchange Trading System), green dollars, and Ithaca hours.\nThey are generally, but not exclusively, associated with economic regen-\neration in the developing world and within impoverished communities\nin western societies. Alternative currencies are often linked to ecological\nconcerns (see Helleiner \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730) although anti-state, anti-capitalist and\neven neo-liberal rationales have also been advanced for establishing\nthese small-scale monetary systems (\uf735). The first LETS was established\non Vancouver Island in \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf733. The development of these systems acce-\n(\uf734) Lietaer refers to these monetary forms as\n\u2018\u2018corporate scrip\u2019\u2019, and suggests that they are\n\u2018\u2018currencies in the making for the \u2018international\ntravelling elite\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Cohen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf735).\n(\uf735) Within the academic literature, local\nforms of money have been viewed as a coun-\nterweight to global capitalism (Pacione \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739),\nas an important tool of local economic devel-\nopment (North \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732; Seyfang \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731), and\nas a vital means of \u2018\u2018community-building\u2019\u2019\n(Glover \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739; Lee \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736; Seyfang \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734).\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf733\uf739\uf731\nlerated during the \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s, and there are now at least two thousand com-\nplementary currencies in operation worldwide.\nIn the majority of cases, complementary currencies circulate outside\nthe mainstream monetary system. Indeed, one might regard their crea-\ntion as a direct consequence of \u2018\u2018financial exclusion\u2019\u2019. Those who join\nsuch schemes tend to be unemployed: they have limited reserves of legal\ntender, and may have been denied access to credit from major commer-\ncial sources. The largest LETS in the UK, based in Manchester, has\nbeen integrated into the mainstream (or formal) economy to some\nextent. The \u2018\u2018bobbins\u2019\u2019 which circulate within the system are accepted\nby some local businesses. In contrast to many LETS, transactions that\nare denominated in Manchester\u2019s \u2018\u2018bobbins\u2019\u2019 are subjected to sales and\nincome tax. But in most instances, those responsible for administering\nLETS have actively sought to insulate them against the official currency\nsystem. They almost invariably have their own unit of denomination:\nfrequently, they are named to reflect the region in which they circulate\n(e.g. \u2018\u2018tales\u2019\u2019 in Canterbury). There are a number of possible reasons for\ndeliberately avoiding links with the official currency: for example, to\navoid being caught up in inflation, to evade taxation by rendering trans-\nactions difficult to convert into the official unit of account, and to\nunderwrite the \u2018\u2018local\u2019\u2019 colour of the money itself.\nElectronic money might constitute a \u2018\u2018threat\u2019\u2019 to state control over\nmoney: primarily, because of the potential scale of its circulation. But\nno-one has seriously suggested that e-money will ever replace state-\nissued currency. In this respect, Cohen is justified in arguing that\ne-money will increase the diversity of money and present governments\nwith new policy challenges. But with complementary currencies, quite\ndifferent questions arise. If the future of money is driven by the logic of\ncurrency competition as Cohen suggests, alternative currencies are\nunlikely to survive. Indeed, the evidence shows that they often fail. Not\nonly are they inherently vulnerable to opportunistic behaviour, but the\ndivision of labour within a particular community may not be sufficiently\ncomplex to allow a dense network of exchanges to develop (Wolters\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731, p. \uf731\uf731). However, given that they are intended to meet a distinctive\nset of policy objectives in their own right, these currencies do not com-\npete with so much as complement state-issued currency. Similarly to\nelectronic money, localized monetary forms fulfill a highly specific\nfunction. But unlike e-money, they are likely to have only a strictly\nlimited sphere of circulation. One might say that they circulate within\nthe interstices of state-issued currency: Cohen (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf731\uf738\uf736), for\nexample, describes them as \u2018\u2018a spreading archipelago within the func-\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf733\uf739\uf732\ntional domains of individual national monies\u2019\u2019. But if we are seeking an\nexplanation of this spread, the concept of currency competition will not\nprovide it.\nThese observations are indicative of a deeper problem in Cohen\u2019s\napproach: his analysis of money runs two separate issues together. The\nfirst issue concerns the ability of governments to manage their own\ncurrencies. Cohen addresses this directly with proposals for how states\nmight deal with the problems of currency internationalization and cur-\nrency substitution (\uf736). The second issue concerns a decline in the\nsignificance of currency as a kind of money. This is raised by Cohen\u2019s\ntreatment of e-money and alternative currencies, but it cannot be dealt\nwith by an approach which is so narrowly concerned with problems of\nmonetary governance. The de-territorialization of money as he defines it\ndoes not refer to a decline in the significance of state-issued currency\nrelative to other monetary forms such as e-money and complementary\ncurrency. Rather, it refers to the erosion of the ability of states to manage\nthe currencies which they produce. In addition, de-territorialization\nrefers to a variety of threats to the capacity of national governments\nto use monetary policy as an effective instrument of macroeconomic\npolicy.\nCohen treats \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 as if it was synonymous with \u2018\u2018currency\u2019\u2019 \u00a2 and\ndoes not define either term. Instead, he appears to be utilising the\nconventional economic definition of money as \u2018\u2018a medium of exchange,\nstore of value and unit of account\u2019\u2019. However, the \u2018\u2018currency pyramid\u2019\u2019\nwhich he describes does not include e-money or complementary cur-\nrency; indeed, it consists only of monetary forms that we conventionally\nthink of as national currency. This is an implicit acknowledgement of\nthe fact that the new forms of money are not currencies. I would argue\nthat \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 is a broader and more complex category than \u2018\u2018currency\u2019\u2019.\nCurrency constitutes the official unit of account within the country, or\ncountries, in which it is legal tender. Currencies are produced by a sys-\ntem of monetary governance. Usually \u00a2 but, as with the euro, not\nnecessarily \u00a2 this consists of a central bank that operates under the aus-\npices of a state. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a currency is\n\u2018\u2018the money of a country in actual use\u2019\u2019. This definition confuses too\n(\uf736) For example, he argues that the trend\ntowards politically independent central banks\nmay have led to \u2018\u2018technical\u2019\u2019 improvements, it\n\u2018\u2018cannot restore the state\u2019s monopoly privi-\nlege\u2019\u2019 over the control of money (Cohen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734,\np. \uf732\uf730\uf738). In other words, governments may as\nwell accept that monetary policy will be an\nincreasingly poor instrument of macroeco-\nnomic policy. In light of this, Cohen (ibid.,\npp. \uf732\uf730\uf738-\uf732\uf731\uf730) advocates a more robust, imagi-\nnative and flexible use of fiscal policy as a\ncounterweight to the weakening effectiveness\nof monetary policy. He even suggests that fiscal\npolicy, too, could be placed in the hands of an\nindependent body, analogous to an indepen-\ndent central bank.\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf733\uf739\uf733\nmany issues. The following definition is more exact: \u2018\u2018currency is legal\ntender within a defined geopolitical space\u2019\u2019. What Cohen calls \u2018\u2018pure\nterritorial money\u2019\u2019 is not, strictly speaking, the same as \u2018\u2018currency\u2019\u2019. The\nwhole point of his argument is that major currencies are increasingly\ncirculating beyond the legal jurisdiction of their issuing authorities. In\nmost cases of currency substitution they do so as legal tender, while in\nothers they simply enjoy a broad domain of legitimate use. In other\nwords, \u2018\u2018pure territorial money\u2019\u2019 refers to a particular kind of currency,\nnamely, one which circulates exclusively within the legal jurisdiction of\nits issuing authority. Cohen argues that this kind of currency is in\ndecline. This \u00a2 and only this \u00a2 is what he captures with the concept of\n\u2018\u2018de-territorialization\u2019\u2019. Other forms of money which circulate alongside\ncurrency may or may not constitute a threat to the monetary sovereignty\nof nation-states. But if they do constitute a threat to monetary soverei-\ngnty, it is not the same threat as currency internationalization and cur-\nrency substitution. This is because they are not currencies. Cohen\u2019s\nargument is about the de-territorialization of currency, not money.\nHow should these other monetary forms \u00a2 electronic money and\ncomplementary currencies \u00a2 be conceived? What is their status as\n\u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019? In the next two sections of this paper, I examine contrasting\nanswers to this question. One answer comes from Ingham, who regards\nthem merely as incomplete money. The other answer comes from Hart,\nwho argues that the emergence of these new monetary forms obliges us\nto re-think our understanding of the nature of money.\nCurrency versus Money\nCohen argues that the growth of air miles, customer loyalty points\nand LETS tokens is symptomatic of the increasing diversity of money.\nBut in light of debates about the nature of money, it is reasonable to ask\nwhether we should refer to such phenomena as \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 at all. Scholars\nhave long argued for the relative merits of competing definitions of\nmoney. The question of how broad or narrow a definition of money\nshould be has been a particular feature of such debates. Concepts such as\n\u2018\u2018near-money\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018pseudo-money\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018limited-purpose money\u2019\u2019 have\nbeen developed which refer to an asset, commodity or medium of\nexchange that fulfils only some of the functions of money. Arguably,\nthe new monetary forms discussed in the preceding section occupy this\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf733\uf739\uf734\ngrey area. They also raise the question of what criteria can be used to\ndecide whether or not something \u2018\u2018qualifies\u2019\u2019 as money. For example, air\nmiles and loyalty points have limited fungibility, and it is questionable\nwhether the people who use them even think of them as money. Com-\nplementary currencies have a yet more restricted circulation, and even\nsome of their leading advocates reject the view that they are actually\nforms of money. Perhaps \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 is not as diverse a phenomenon as\nCohen would have us believe. This is the standpoint taken by Ingham,\nwhose arguments are discussed in this section. In The Nature of Money\n(\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734) and other articles, Ingham claims to be providing the first full-\nbodied sociological treatment of money. Moreover, he states that his\ntheory of money addresses \u2018\u2018mainstream\u2019\u2019 issues which sociologists have\nneglected, such as inflation, the control of the money supply, and so\non (\uf737).\nIngham\u2019s argument revolves around the assertion that money is\ndeeply embedded in social structure. Hitherto, sociologists have focused\non monetary exchange in various ways, emphasising questions con-\ncerning trust and meaning that arise whenever money is used. But the\nproduction of money \u00a2 and not merely its use \u00a2 is a social process accord-\ning to Ingham (\uf738). The social production of money is integral to a\nbroader struggle for power \u00a2 or what Weber (\uf731\uf739\uf737\uf738, p. \uf731\uf730\uf738; cited in\nIngham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf736\uf737; \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738, p. \uf731\uf734) calls the \u2018\u2018economic struggle\u2019\u2019. This\nstruggle determines the value of money. On one side of the struggle,\nmonetary agencies (banks, and so forth) contend to preserve and store\nvalue in money, control its supply and extract interest. Against the\nmonetary agencies, industrialists \u00a2 the producers of commodities \u00a2\nattempt to \u2018\u2018monetize their market power\u2019\u2019 through rising prices or by\nborrowing. These two protagonists are \u2018\u2018distinct and relatively autono-\nmous\u2019\u2019 (Ingham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731, p. \uf733\uf731\uf738): each side \u2018\u2018imposes limitations on, and\ncontinually threatens to perturb or impede, the operation of the other\u2019\u2019\n(Ingham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf731\uf735\uf731). The state, mainly through its central bank and\nministry of finance, has its own special interests to defend. It thus\nconstitutes not only a \u2018\u2018third corner of this triadic power struggle\u2019\u2019\n(Ingham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731, p. \uf733\uf731\uf738), but also the site on which the struggle takes place\n(Ingham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf731\uf735\uf730). Problems, such as inflation, arise whenever this\nstruggle becomes unstable. Thus the production of money involves a\n\u2018\u2018continuous rebalancing of the power relations between economic\n(\uf737) Specifically, he argues that, hitherto,\nsociologists have focused largely on discourse\nabout money, at the expense of what they see\n\u2018\u2018as \u2018economic\u2019 problems, such as inflation, the\nsupply of credit, the determination of interest\nrates, and so on\u2019\u2019 (Ingham \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738, p. \uf731\uf734; see also\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, pp. \uf739-\uf731\uf730).\n(\uf738) As he puts it, \u2018\u2018money itself is a social\nrelation\u2019\u2019 (Ingham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf731\uf732; \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736, p. \uf735\uf731\uf730).\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf733\uf739\uf735\ninterests\u2019\u2019 (Ingham \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738, p. \uf731\uf734): monetary policy is in this sense a\n\u2018\u2018reinforcement of any balance of power that has been forged\u2019\u2019 (Ingham\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf731\uf735\uf730).\nIngham (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731, p. \uf733\uf731\uf738) goes on to argue that although money\u2019s value is\ndetermined by these competing interests, the definition of what counts as\nmoney is declared by a political authority that transcends such interests.\nIn the modern era, this authority consists of the state, which uses its\npower to \u2018\u2018impose a hegemonic meaning\u2019\u2019 of money. The state does so by\ndefining the unit of account \u00a2 or what Keynes (\uf731\uf739\uf733\uf730, p. \uf733) calls money-\nof-account \u00a2 for the money which circulates within its territory. Ingham\n(\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf731\uf739\uf738) argues that this unit of account is vital to our under-\nstanding of the nature of money: money \u2018\u2018is always an abstract claim or\ncredit whose \u2018moneyness\u2019 is conferred by a money of account\u2019\u2019.\nIngham\u2019s definition of money is therefore twofold. First, he draws on\nSimmel\u2019s characterisation of money as a \u2018\u2018generic promise to pay\u2019\u2019:\nmoney is a unique form of credit because it expresses a relationship not\nbetween two individuals but between every individual and the entire\n\u2018\u2018society\u2019\u2019. Second, Ingham argues that only those promises to pay that\nare denominated in the official money-of-account can be thought of as\n\u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019. Only the state has the requisite authority to define a money-\nof-account. Money is therefore \u2018\u2018a form of sovereignty, and as such it\ncannot be understood without reference to an authority\u2019\u2019 (Ingham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734,\np. \uf731\uf732).\nIt follows from this image of monetary relations that any form of\n\u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 which is not denominated in the official unit of account must\nbe deficient in some way. Unofficial money will be too specialised in\nterms of its possible uses, and too restricted in its potential sphere of\ncirculation. Predictably, Ingham has little sympathy for arguments\nabout the diversity \u00a2 let alone the disintegration \u00a2 of money. He argues\nthat e-money is likely to have an extremely limited capacity for success\nunless it is denominated in the official money-of-account. And local\nalternatives to currency are little more than media of exchange which\nfacilitate bartering. We might want to think of air miles and comple-\nmentary currencies as \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019, but they will never be complete money.\nIndeed they match the anthropological notion of \u2018\u2018limited-purpose\u2019\u2019\nmoney. Ingham is in agreement with Cohen that the state\u2019s role in\ncontrolling money is being eroded to some degree: \u2018\u2018globally from the\noutside\u2019\u2019 by electronic money, and \u2018\u2018locally from the inside\u2019\u2019 by local\nmonetary forms (Cohen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf731\uf737\uf737; \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738, p. \uf731\uf733). But as long as states\nare the world\u2019s primary source of political authority, any monetary form\nwhich is not denominated in a state-defined unit of account can only be\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf733\uf739\uf736\nregarded as \u2018\u2018partial\u2019\u2019 money. As such, forms such as e-money and\ncomplementary currency can hardly be regarded as a major threat to the\nhegemony of state-issued currency within the world\u2019s money-flows.\nIn some respects, this is an ingenious response to recent debates over\nthe changing nature of money. But while Ingham draws our attention to\nthe structural factors which are inherent in the production of money, his\nanalysis says relatively little about the everyday use of money. Similarly\nto Cohen, he tends to regard the demand for money as if it was derived\nonly from financial markets, banks and corporations. Of course, such an\nemphasis is justified if one thinks only of the sheer volume of money\nwhich is handled by these institutions. But there are grounds for arguing\nthat a fully sociological approach to the analysis of money should provide\na more sustained treatment of its everyday, or non-specialist, users.\nOddly enough, this flaw in Ingham\u2019s approach is most clearly exposed in\nrelation to a form of money which not even he could dismiss as \u2018\u2018partial\u2019\u2019,\nnamely, the euro.\nThe euro does not fit neatly into Ingham\u2019s characterisation of money.\nIt is an officially prescribed \u2018\u2018money-of-account\u2019\u2019 which has applied\nthroughout the twelve member-states of the euro zone since January\n\uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739, even though euro notes and coins were not issued for another three\nyears. Yet in two key respects, the euro falls outside of Ingham\u2019s\napproach to money. Firstly, the euro is defined as the \u2018\u2018official\u2019\u2019 unit of\naccount for the euro zone by a pool of twelve states, not a sovereign\npolitical authority. Indeed, one of the problems that Ingham identifies\nwith the euro is that there is no such authority within the euro zone\nwhich can act as a counterweight to the independent European Cen-\ntral Bank. He argues that the twelve member-states have effectively\nsurrendered their sovereign control over the production of money to a\npolitically independent institution, the ECB. In time, these states will\nneed to wrest that authority back when domestic circumstances demand.\nBy implication, the options would be either to forge ahead towards a\nfully-fledged federalist political structure, or to fall back into a system of\ntwelve separate national currencies. Either prospect would leave\nIngham\u2019s characterisation of money intact. But at present, the evidence\nsuggests that a more complex series of political arrangements are being\ndevised \u00a2 almost ad hoc \u00a2 between the key institutions within the euro\nzone that are ensuring the longer-term success of the new currency.\nThus it seems that, for the time being at least, the world\u2019s second major\ncurrency is not \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 as Ingham would characterise it. A second\nproblem in Ingham\u2019s approach is illuminated when it is used to examine\nthe euro. The euro is the official unit of account within the euro zone,\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf733\uf739\uf737\nbut by no means the only unit of account as far as many of its users are\nconcerned. In most countries within the euro zone, the majority of those\nwho use the euro on an everyday basis still calculate in terms of their old\ncurrencies when making both large and small purchases (\uf739). Dual pri-\ncing still exists in several currencies, and many everyday users of the\nnew currency appear to want dual pricing to remain (\uf731\uf730). Thus for most\npeople within the euro zone, there is no single \u00a2 or hegemonic, as\nIngham puts it \u00a2 money-of-account. Rather, there are two, at least as far\nas the users\u2019 experiences with the new currency are concerned.\nIngham\u2019s insistence that \u2018\u2018complete\u2019\u2019 money is defined by the offi-\ncially prescribed money-of-account glosses over the complexities that\nare involved when we calculate in terms of money. The evidence that is\nsuggested by the euro so far indicates that there are other reasons \u00a2 not\njust political authority \u00a2 why people use a specific unit of account within\nmonetary transactions. Convenience and familiarity come immediately\nto mind. Ingham is therefore unjustified in insisting that \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 is\nnecessarily equivalent to the official money-of-account. He might\ncounter, of course, that the euro is an exceptional case: as with decima-\nlization in Britain during the early \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf730s, the old money-of-account will\nsimply wither away. But a similar difficulty arises in regard to Ingham\u2019s\ntreatment of e-money. He maintains that e-money will not undermine\nthe hegemony of state-issued currency because it must be denominated\nin the official money of account in order to be widely accepted. This is\nplainly untrue. One important feature of many forms of e-money is that\nthey have their own units of denomination: points, miles, and so forth.\nThese units are part of an autonomous accounting system in which the\nschemes\u2019 relationship to currency can vary (\uf731\uf731). Far from undermining\n(\uf739) According to a \u2018\u2018Eurobarometer\u2019\u2019 survey\nconducted in October-November \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733, this is\nespecially so when large purchases are made:\nacross the EU-\uf731\uf732, \uf735\uf734% of those surveyed cal-\nculate in euros when making purchases such as\na house or car, while a further \uf732\uf737% calculate in\nboth euros and their old national currencies.\nBut even in respect of smaller, everyday pur-\nchases, \uf733\uf730% of those surveyed still calculate in\ntheir national currencies, while a further \uf732\uf734%\ncalculate in both denominations (Eurobarmo-\nter Flash Survey no \uf731\uf735\uf733).\n(\uf731\uf730) Significantly, \uf734\uf736% of respondents\nwould prefer dual pricing to continue,\nalthough this ranges widely across the euro\nzone: the figure is as low as \uf731\uf737% in the\nNetherlands, and as high as \uf736\uf737% in France.\nSupport for continued dual pricing correlates\npositively with age and negatively with educa-\ntional attainment (Eurobarmoter Flash Survey\nno \uf731\uf735\uf733).\n(\uf731\uf731) For example, specified amounts of\nNectar points can be exchanged for cash dis-\ncounts with another retailer (Argos), while also\nbeing used to make outright purchases of dis-\ncrete items: thus \uf731\uf732,\uf730\uf730\uf730 points equals a \u00a3\uf736\uf730\ndiscount or two return flights from the UK to\nParis; \uf739,\uf730\uf730\uf730 points equals a \u00a3\uf734\uf735 discount or a\ncordless drill; and \uf735,\uf730\uf730\uf730 equals a \u00a3\uf732\uf735 discount\nor two entry tickets to a theme park. In effect,\nmembers of such loyalty schemes can choose\nwhether to use their points in a similar way to\n\u2018\u2018conventional\u2019\u2019 money, or to use them in a\nmuch more specific way. This suggests that\nperhaps the most significant aspect of electro-\nnic money is its potential impact on the ways in\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf733\uf739\uf738\nthese schemes, the autonomous unit of account gives them a distinctive\ncharacter. If anything, Ingham\u2019s interpretation of their relationship to\ncurrency can be reversed. According to Lietaer (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731, p. \uf737\uf730), for exam-\nple, the most successful electronic payments systems in the near future\nare likely to be those which do not deal exclusively with national cur-\nrency: in which \u2018\u2018value\u2019\u2019 can be transmitted via a number of alternative\ndenominations. For the sake of consistency, Ingham might have argued\nthat e-money should not be referred to as \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 at all. What he\nactually says, however, is that e-money and complementary currencies\nare \u2018\u2018incomplete\u2019\u2019 forms of money. Here is the rub. Most forms of\ne-money, and most complementary currencies, are not denominated in\nthe official money-of-account. But not even Ingham chooses to deny\nthat they are forms of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019. For this reason, his definition of money\nas equivalent to the officially prescribed money of account flakes away.\nThese observations reveal a deeper conceptual flaw in Ingham\u2019s\napproach to money. All that he provides, in the final analysis, is a defi-\nnition of currency. He does not offer a convincing definition of money.\nEven if one wants to agree that e-money and complementary currencies\nare incomplete forms of money, they nevertheless fall outside of\nIngham\u2019s definition. As I have already suggested, \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 is a broader\ncategory than \u2018\u2018currency\u2019\u2019. It is certainly more difficult to define. If we\nwant to develop a broader and more flexible approach to the concept of\n\u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019, we must search elsewhere.\nMultiple Meanings, Multiple Monies\nLet us look, then, at the arguments of Zelizer and Hart, who both\nmaintain that money is a diverse phenomenon and therefore impossible\nto conceptualise on the basis of a single definition. Zelizer contends that\nwe need to develop \u2018\u2018a differentiated model of money\u2019\u2019 (\uf731\uf739\uf739\uf734, p. \uf731\uf738)\nwhich can account for its multiple forms. Likewise, Hart argues that\n\u2018\u2018money today is more plural and dynamic than at any time previously\u2019\u2019\n(\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730, p. \uf732\uf733\uf735). But the new monetary forms that have been discussed so\nwhich money is perceived and used. According\nto Lietaer (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731, p. \uf737\uf733), electronic money\n\u2018\u2018provides unprecedented opportunities for\nrethinking the kind of money we want, and for\nincorporating features to help address issues\nour societies will be facing in the foreseeable\nfuture\u2019\u2019. This presupposes, of course, that\npeople begin to think of the points they have\naccrued on loyalty cards, and the air miles they\nhave accumulated through frequent flying, as\nforms of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019. It is open to doubt whether\nmany do so at the present time.\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf733\uf739\uf739\nfar in this paper highlight a crucial difference between the two argu-\nments. Whereas the diversity of money as Zelizer conceives it is a\nfunction of her perspective, Hart\u2019s analysis concerns the changing\nnature of money itself. It is the work of Hart that throws up more\nchallenging questions for the sociology of money.\nZelizer (\uf731\uf739\uf739\uf734, p. \uf731\uf731) criticizes notions of money which portray it as a\n\u2018\u2018homogenous, infinitely divisible, liquid object, lacking in quality\u2019\u2019. She\nconveys money as \u2018\u2018multiple\u2019\u2019, i.e. as monies, not money. According to\nZelizer, the multiplicity of money derives from the differentiated ways in\nwhich we impute meanings to it whenever it is in our possession. She\ncalls this process \u2018\u2018earmarking\u2019\u2019. Earmarking works in a number of\ninterrelated ways: by restricting the use, regulating the allocation,\nmodifying the appearance, and attaching special meanings to a particu-\nlar quantity of money (ibid., p. \uf732\uf739). For instance, by allocating specific\nquantities of our income to manage a domestic budget, or by setting\naside currency received as a gift for a specific purchase, we impute a\nspecific meaning to money which undermines its supposedly impersonal\ncharacter (ibid., p. \uf731\uf731). Hence through earmarking, cultural and social\nstructures introduce \u2018\u2018profound controls and restrictions on the flow and\nliquidity of monies\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf731\uf739). Accordingly, Zelizer (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730b,\npp. \uf733\uf738\uf734-\uf733\uf738\uf735) offers a wide-ranging and multi-faceted characterisation of\nmoney:\nInternational currencies, nationally issued legal tenders, electronic monies, bank\naccounts, and other highly liquid tokens of transferable rights represent one\nextreme of a continuum running from such generalized forms to the narrowly\nlimited circuits of such other monies as credits in baby-sitting pools, casino chips,\nor investment diamonds.\nSome of Zelizer\u2019s critics have objected to this characterisation of\nmonies on account of its breadth (\uf731\uf732). The problem is not one of\nbreadth, however, but rather that her conceptual vocabulary is too slip-\npery. By demonstrating that, in terms of their social meaning, \u2018\u2018not all\ndollars are the same\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf731\uf731), Zelizer\u2019s approach enables us to look\nat money in a different way. In other words, the \u2018\u2018multiplicity\u2019\u2019 that she\ndescribes is primarily a function of the perspective that she adopts as an\nobserver. Zelizer appears to concede as much when defending her\narguments against the criticisms of Fine and Lapavitsas:\n(\uf731\uf732) For example, Fine and Lapavitsas\n(\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730, p. \uf733\uf737\uf735) argue that \u2018\u2018Zelizer offers no\ndefinition of money at all\u2019\u2019 but merely offers \u2018\u2018a\nbroad range of examples\u2019\u2019. They refer to these\nexamples as a \u2018\u2018chaotic ensemble\u2019\u2019 (ibid.,\np. \uf733\uf737\uf736). On a different tack, Ingham (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731,\np. \uf733\uf731\uf733) argues that \u2018\u2018the social earmarking of\nmoney for specific purposes... could not occur\nunless uniform money existed\u2019\u2019. Persumably,\nby \u2018\u2018uniform money\u2019\u2019, Ingham specifically\nmeans currency.\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf734\uf730\uf730\nAll moneys are actually dual: they serve both general and local circuits... Seen from\nthe top, economic transactions connect with broad national symbolic meanings and\ninstitutions. Seen from the bottom, however, economic transactions are highly dif-\nferentiated, personalized, and local, meaningful to particular relations. No\ncontradiction therefore exists between uniformity and diversity: they are simply\ntwo different aspects of the same transaction. (Zelizer \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730b, p. \uf733\uf738\uf736, italics\nadded)\nThis statement suggests that to focus on earmarking is to take a\n\u2018\u2018micro\u2019\u2019 as opposed to a \u2018\u2018macro\u2019\u2019 approach to the analysis of money. In\ncontrast to the approach that is taken by Ingham, it is to look at currency\nfrom the perspective of its users, not its producers. By adopting this\nperspective, one can glean many insights from the fluid meanings of\nmoney. But if earmarking renders money meaningful, it does not\nnecessarily transform it in any fundamental way. In other words, while\nearmarking explains the multiplicity of money\u2019s meaning, it cannot\naccount for the diversity of monetary forms that circulate in the present\nday. Zelizer does suggest that money can and does assume a diverse\nnumber of forms. The inventory of monies that she provides makes this\nclear (\uf731\uf733). But while monetary forms such as casino chips and baby-\nsitting tokens may be earmarked by their users, this by itself cannot\nexplain how such forms come to be used and regarded as \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 in the\nfirst place. Given the diversity of forms that Zelizer includes in her\ndefinition, what do these specific forms have in common that entitles us\nto regard them as \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019? Zelizer does not directly address this\nquestion. But an answer of sorts is implied by her argument that\n\u2018\u2018monies certainly include officially issued coins and bills, but they also\ninclude all objects that have recognised regularised exchange value in\none social setting or another\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf731). Thus \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 might include\n\u2018\u2018tokens and commercial paper to art objects, and even including kitchen\nrecipes or jokes\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf739) \u00a2 as long as someone recognises such\nobjects as money. We are in danger of running in circles.\nExpressed in Zelizer\u2019s terms, the claim that money has become\nincreasingly diverse in terms of its form suggests that there is no general\ncircuit to which an equally generalised form of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 corresponds.\nRather, a number of specialised circuits have emerged, each of which\nhas acquired its own specific monetary form. These forms circulate\nalongside state-issued currency. Their creation therefore raises a more\nfar-reaching set of sociological questions than does earmarking alone. In\n(\uf731\uf733) Zelizer\u2019s analysis could be strengthened\nby distinguishing between money and currency.\nMost of the examples of earmarking that she\ncites apply to currency: they add colour to the\nUS dollar. But how are monetary forms that\nare not denominated in official currency crea-\nted? It seems doubtful whether this can be\nexplained by the concept of \u2018\u2018earmarking\u2019\u2019\nalone.\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf734\uf730\uf731\norder to explore the implications of this creation, we must turn to the\nrecent work of an anthropologist, Hart.\nOn one level, Hart\u2019s analysis of the changing nature of money\nconcurs with that of Cohen. Hart (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730, p. \uf732\uf733\uf735) states that, today,\nmoney \u2018\u2018is more plural and dynamic than at any time previously\u2019\u2019.\nUnlike Cohen, he draws attention to the fact that an increasing number\nof the monetary forms which circulate in the present day are not cur-\nrencies:\nDictionaries [concentrate] on the money form itself, which they usually refer to as\n\u2018\u2018currency\u2019\u2019, whatever is in circulation: coins, banknotes and other instruments\nissued by governments. But then what about personal checks and savings\naccounts, private notes of bank credit and, more recently, plastic cards of all kinds\nlinking us into electronic networks that greatly increase our spending options? The\nmoney form is not standing still. (ibid., p. \uf732\uf733\uf737)\nWhereas Cohen\u2019s analysis is underpinned by the idea of currency\ncompetition, Hart\u2019s argument is premised on the impact of what he calls\nthe \u2018\u2018communications revolution\u2019\u2019. This revolution primarily consists of\nthe computerisation of communication and market processes, particu-\nlarly the growth of Internet commerce (\uf731\uf734). Hart\u2019s argument focuses on\nthe development of computerised trading networks, and on their\nimplications for individuals and local communities. It is this aspect of\nhis approach, and the characterisation of money which he derives from\nit, that is most intriguing from a sociological point of view.\nWith regard to currency, Hart agrees that the state\u2019s role in the pro-\nduction of money is being eroded. However, his investigation focuses\nless on the difficulties that this erosion presents to governments (\uf731\uf735)\nthan on their implications for everyone else. He appears to reject the\nview that money necessarily requires the support of a sovereign political\nbody in order to be widely accepted. It is only the modern pre-eminence\nof state capitalism, he alleges, which has made such an arrangement\nappear inevitable and even \u2018\u2018natural\u2019\u2019. In a similar way to Zelizer, Hart\nalso rejects the tendency among scholars to conceive of monetary rela-\ntions as inherently impersonal. But whereas Zelizer locates her argu-\nment in the social meanings that monetary exchange inevitably acquires\n(\uf731\uf734) As he states, \u2018\u2018[t]he great potential of the\nInternet is not restricted to the money form in\na narrow sense, but lies rather in the expansion\nof electronic markets, in borderless trade at the\nspeed of light. For electronic money will\ndevelop to the extent that it is needed for such\ntrade\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf737\uf736).\n(\uf731\uf735) He does not completely ignore this\nissue. For example, he argues that the recent\npredominance of nation-states in the produc-\ntion and management of currency \u2018\u2018is rapidly\ngiving way, under pressure from the interna-\ntional economy, to a phase where money mar-\nkets, offshore banking and electronic payment\nsystems have sharply reduced the autonomy of\nnational governments\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf733\uf735). Here\nagain, his analysis concurs with that of Cohen.\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf734\uf730\uf732\nthrough earmarking, Hart\u2019s position is cast in terms of the historical\nemergence of electronic money (\uf731\uf736). He argues that digitalised forms of\nmoney are a decentralising force within markets for both consumer\ngoods and financial products. Mainly through the Internet, consumers\nare being offered a diverse range of media through which to pay for\ngoods or attain credit. In this way, e-money is increasingly being mani-\nfest as personal credit. According to Hart, money is thereby being\ntransformed into an entity whose production \u00a2 contra Ingham \u00a2 we can\ncontrol. In other words, money is ceasing to be an \u2018\u2018object\u2019\u2019 which exists\noutside of us. In Hart\u2019s view, this presents a challenge to conventional\nunderstandings of economic agency: power is being transferred from the\nproducers of money to the users themselves.\nHart\u2019s arguments are suggestive, but speculative. For example, his\ncontention that the growing range of available ways in which to pay with\n(and borrow) money necessarily equates with a transfer of economic\npower away from states and corporations requires detailed empirical\nscrutiny. While Hart is encouraged by the \u2018\u2018subversive\u2019\u2019 potential of so\nmuch activity that takes place through the Internet (e.g. p. \uf733\uf730\uf738), one\nwonders just how far this can impact on the seemingly irresistible power\nof financial markets. But as Hart himself makes clear, he is not sugges-\nting that money is being re-personalized in all of its forms. State cur-\nrency is and will remain the dominant form of money, although it is\nundoubtedly losing its monopoly over the world\u2019s monetary system. If\nanything, the analysis he proposes is a dialectical one. That is to say, the\ndevelopment of e-money can act as a counterweight to the growth of\nfinancial markets, generating a form of currency competition which is\ndriven by consumers rather than by institutional elites:\n[...] any moves towards more personalised forms of money will co-exist with those\nthat are already dominant. A large number of transactions, involving people and\ninstitutions around the world, will have the need of a money or moneys that\nhave wide acceptability both as money-of-account and as money-proper, to use\nKeynes\u2019s terms. At present the dollar and, to a lesser extent, some other national\ncurrencies play such a role; and this has been enhanced by the financial turbulence\nin East Asia, Russia and elsewhere during the late \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s. (ibid., p. \uf732\uf739\uf738)\nAccording to Hart, one of the most important characteristics of\nelectronic money is the way in which it transmits information. In eco-\nnomics, the information that is transmitted by money has conventionally\nbeen understood as consisting of abstract price signals which enable\n(\uf731\uf736) In the context of Hart\u2019s argument,\ne-money primarily consists of money that is\nproduced by corporations. However, he notes\nthat local alternatives to currency are begin-\nning to circulate in electronic form, and sug-\ngests that they are more likely to be successful\nas a result of this.\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf734\uf730\uf733\nmarkets to clear. But e-money transmits information that is considerably\nmore personalised than anything that could be conveyed through price\nalone. According to Hart, classically modern conceptions of money as an\nanonymous medium of exchange have been undermined not only by the\nincreasing diversity of money but also by a fundamental change in the\nnature of the monetary form. Increasingly, monetary transactions are\ntraceable: not just in terms of the amount which has changed hands but\nalso in terms of the preferences of buyers. \u2018\u2018Loyalty\u2019\u2019 cards offer an\noutstanding example of this development, enabling corporations to\nmanipulate sophisticated detailed data about their customers\u2019 buying\nbehaviour. According to Hart, the application of this technology within\ndecentralised markets has the potential to transform money from an\nimpersonal medium of exchange to \u2018\u2018an act of remembering, a way of\nkeeping track of the exchanges we each enter into\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf733\uf734). If such\na potential is realised, money will act as a perpetually mobile testimony\nto our participation in a diverse range of specialised payments networks.\nIndeed, this is as close as Hart comes to providing a general definition of\nmoney. It is \u2018\u2018an instrument of collective memory\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf733\uf734): a\nmemory bank which tracks a diverse range of social exchanges that are\nmediated by increasingly specialised monetary forms (\uf731\uf737).\nHart\u2019s characterisation of money as an instrument of collective\nmemory invites us to imagine the myriad potential ways in which money\nmight be appropriated by individuals and communities. His primary\naim is to decouple our understanding of money from a particular\nconception of the market as autonomous (\uf731\uf738); and by doing so, to\nencourage more creative interpretations of the nature of money\nitself (\uf731\uf739). In addition, he seeks to decouple our interpretation of money\nfrom a particular conception of society. According to Hart (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730,\np. \uf732\uf733\uf735), money is a \u2018\u2018token of society\u2019\u2019. But he uses a differentiated\nconcept of \u2018\u2018society\u2019\u2019 in order to elaborate this claim. He notes that\n\u2018\u2018society\u2019\u2019 has three distinct senses within the sociological and anthro-\npological literature on money: as state, nation and community. All three\nsenses imply a critique of the conventional \u2018\u2018commodity\u2019\u2019 theory of\n(\uf731\uf737) Hart (ibid., p. \uf733\uf731\uf738-\uf733\uf731\uf739): \u2018\u2018we should\nlook for the meaning of money in the myriad\nacts of remembering that link individuals to\ntheir communities. In this interpretation, the\nneed to keep track of proliferating connections\nwith others is mediated by money in its many\nforms as the principal instrument of collective\nmemory\u2019\u2019.\n(\uf731\uf738) Specifically, he associates this con-\nception with state capitalism, and argues\nthat this system of political economy is in\ndecline.\n(\uf731\uf739) Of course, Hart\u2019s analysis rests on some\ndebateable assumptions about the future tra-\njectory of Internet commerce, and of the\npotential impact of the Internet on local\nexchange schemes and other payments\nnetworks. But the aim of this paper is not to\nevaluate predictions about the future of\nmoney.\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf734\uf730\uf734\nmoney by suggesting that \u2018\u2018money is a symbol of something intangible,\nan aspect of human agency, not just a thing\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf735\uf732). Moreover,\neach concept of \u2018\u2018society\u2019\u2019 yields a distinctive conception of the inter-\nrelationship between money and social structure. When viewed as a\ncreature of the state, money is conveyed as a tool of power which\nexpresses \u2018\u2018vertical relations between unequals, rulers and rules, like the\ntop and bottom two sides of the coin, heads and tails\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf735\uf732). By\ncontrast, when \u2018\u2018society\u2019\u2019 is taken to mean community, money\u2019s depen-\ndence on trust is underlined. This locates the source of monetary value\nwithin \u2018\u2018horizontal\u2019\u2019 relations between members of a community. The\nassociation of money with nation combines these vertical and horizontal\ninterpretations, i.e. \u2018\u2018the formality of the state with the informal sub-\nstance of community\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf735\uf732). Hart\u2019s analysis of e-money and\nlocal alternatives to currency leans strongly towards the interpretation of\nsociety as \u2018\u2018community\u2019\u2019. But he does not exclude the two other senses of\nthe term. Thus one might imagine that \u2018\u2018society\u2019\u2019 should be rendered\nas \u2018\u2018state\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018nation\u2019\u2019 where the sociological analysis of currency is\nconcerned. This, of course, is exactly the approach which is taken by\nIngham.\nBoth Zelizer and Hart suggest that money is a more multifaceted\nphenomenon than sociologists and anthropologists have conventionally\nadmitted. Each scholar resists the association of money with an abstract,\nimpersonal market. Zelizer\u2019s monies are rendered multiple by virtue of\nthe meanings that are attached to them in the context of their use. But\nshe does not advance a robust concept of money. Her argument therefore\nleaves sociologists with little choice but to describe the various forms of\nmoney which are in circulation without thinking through what \u2018\u2018mone-\ntary\u2019\u2019 features they have in common. By contrast, Hart\u2019s monies are\nmultiple as entities in their own right. But there is a significant weakness\nin his approach. Although he often writes of the diversity of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 in\na general sense, his argument stands out in its emphasis on the diversity\nof monetary forms that circulate in the present day (\uf732\uf730). He does not\ndistinguish between cases in which the monetary form in question is\ndenominated in the official currency, and cases in which it is not. Hart\n(\uf732\uf730) For example, he argues that most of us\nhave access to six different kinds of money:\ncoins, banknotes, cheques, savings accounts\nand plastic credit and debit cards (ibid., p. \uf732\uf734\uf731).\nAlthough he suggests that \u2018\u2018the relative signi-\nficance of all of these is constantly shifting\u2019\u2019\n(ibid., p. \uf732\uf734\uf731), he regards all such forms of\nmoney as part of a broader-based trend\ntowards money\u2019s dematerialisation: \u2018\u2018money\nhas become dematerialised, losing any shred of\na claim that it is founded on the natural scarcity\nof precious metals. Even the authority of sta-\ntes, which stamped coinage and issued the\nnotes with which we are still most familiar as\nmoney, cannot long survive the electronic\nblizzard that is money in the age of the Inter-\nnet\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf733\uf733).\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf734\uf730\uf735\nacknowledges that an increasing number of monetary forms are not\ndenominated in official currency. But he does not recognise the full\nimplications of this. For example, many LETS activists have resisted\ngovernment attempts to levy taxes on transactions within their schemes\nby creating an accounting system which is difficult to convert into cur-\nrency. There is even, in some instances, a refusal to refer to such tokens\nas money so that the transactions mediated by them are not classified as\n\u2018\u2018monetary\u2019\u2019 for taxation purposes (Hart \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730, p. \uf732\uf738\uf731). This definitional\nissue has made the literature on LETS somewhat perplexing in\nconceptual terms. But it merely reflects wider confusions about the\nnature of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 \u00a2 as opposed to \u2018\u2018currency\u2019\u2019 \u00a2 in general.\nHart advances some thought-provoking arguments about how we\nmight conceive of new monetary forms such as e-money. But his des-\ncription of money as an instrument of collective memory cannot be\napplied in a general way. The use of anonymous forms of money such as\ncash might be in decline, but is unlikely to disappear. His approach\ntherefore brings us no closer to answering the main question of this\npaper: What is it about \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 that the various monetary forms have\nin common? In the concluding section of this paper, I shall be proposing\nan answer of my own.\nConclusion\nGreater conceptual clarity can be brought to bear on the issues which\nI have been discussing in this paper by examining diversity of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019\non two axes: in terms of the monetary medium on the one hand, and in\nterms of money\u2019s denomination on the other. All four scholars whose\nwork has been discussed in this paper conflate these two axes. The fact\nthat none of them draws a meaningful distinction between \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018currency\u2019\u2019 is symptomatic of this.\nThe first axis on which money has diversified concerns one monetary\nmedium. This refers to the material qualities of money. According to\nIngham, such qualities should not enter into a sociological conception of\nmoney. In his view, once money has been defined as a generic promise to\npay that is denominated in \u2018\u2018money-of-account\u2019\u2019, the material qualities\nof actual forms of money are irrelevant. In other words, all money is\n\u2018\u2018virtual\u2019\u2019 in principle. Ingham argues that monetary theory has always\nbeen undermined by a fundamental category error between the specific\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf734\uf730\uf736\nform that is taken by \u2018\u2018money-stuff\u2019\u2019 and the more general quality of\n\u2018\u2018money-ness\u2019\u2019 which all monetary forms have in common (\uf732\uf731). He has a\npoint. To be sure, we should not reduce our understanding of money to\nthe forms which it takes. But to insist on the irrelevance of \u2018\u2018money-\nstuff\u2019\u2019 to a sociological understanding of money is mistaken. As Hart\u2019s\nanalysis shows, the form in which money is conveyed can be vitally\nimportant to its role and impact in society. The increasingly varied\nnature of \u2018\u2018money-stuff\u2019\u2019 has affected the relationship between money\nand major social institutions such as the state and corporations.\nMoreover, it influences how people use and think about \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 in\nrelation to their own lives and circumstances. A sociological approach to\nmoney cannot ignore such issues.\nThere is second axis on which \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 has diversified: namely, as a\ndenomination. In Ingham\u2019s view, the quality of \u2018\u2018money-ness\u2019\u2019 is\nconferred on a monetary form by virtue of the fact that it has been\ndenominated within a \u2018\u2018money-of-account\u2019\u2019. Here again, he has a good\npoint. One of the key functions of money is to quantify value, and\nmoney-of-account provides the abstract system of measurement which\nmakes this possible. But Ingham\u2019s insistence that money-of-account\nmust be defined by a sovereign authority such as the state is conceptually\nunjustified and empirically misleading. To all intents and purposes,\nIngham has simply redefined money as currency. As a consequence of\nthis, he is bound to underplay the significance of alternatives to cur-\nrency, and his scepticism towards the euro can come as no surprise.\nEmpirically, as Hart\u2019s analysis shows, \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 circulates in a variety of\ndenominations today. There is no compelling reason to assume that\nforms of money which are not denominated in the official currency are\nbound to fail. After all, the period during which states have enjoyed a\nmonopoly over the production of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 \u00a2 and in which currencies\nhave therefore been the only forms of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 worthy of note \u00a2 has\nspanned barely two hundred years.\nSociologically speaking, arguments about the diversity of money\nmust be placed in proper perspective. Along both axes \u00a2 monetary\nmedium on the one hand, and monetary denomination on the other \u00a2\ndiversification brings with it some variable consequences for the dif-\nferent parties with a stake in the production and use of money. Consider\nthe state, for example. The circulation of currency in an increasingly\ndematerialised medium presents serious difficulties for monetary policy,\nwhereas the circulation of monetary forms in other denominations raises\n(\uf732\uf731) He argues that this is \u2018\u2018a basic category\nerror, which... has persisted since the classical\nGreek commodity theory of metallic coinage\u2019\u2019\n(Ingham \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734, p. \uf737\uf736).\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf734\uf730\uf737\nformal (or legal) issues of monetary governance. But contrary to the\nargument of Cohen, the diversification of money is not simply an issue\nfor governments. Some communities, particularly in impoverished\nregions, have much to lose from the internationalization of currency.\nAnd as Hart observes, they may have a considerable amount to gain from\nthe development of electronic money. Whatever Ingham might say, the\n\u2018\u2018social production\u2019\u2019 of money cannot be reduced to a \u2018\u2018struggle\u2019\u2019\nbetween the industrial and financial elites.\nIf money has diversified as medium and as denomination, what does\nthis imply for a more general conception of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019? In this paper,\nI have considered some richly contrasting ways of describing money.\nBut of the four scholars whose work I have discussed, only Ingham seeks\nto provide an overarching definition of money. His definition is flawed\nbecause it excludes monetary denominations that now circulate along-\nside currency. Nevertheless, Ingham\u2019s strategy does suggest a way\nforward towards a more coherent sociological concept of money. In an\nearlier article, Ingham defines \u2018\u2018money-of-account\u2019\u2019 as \u2018\u2018a conceptual\nscheme for the measurement of value, which lies behind any particular\nform that [money] might take as a means of payment\u2019\u2019 (Ingham \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738,\np. \uf739). In order to embrace the full diversity of \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019, this definition\nmust be abstracted from its Keynesian roots and decoupled from the\nstate. But this requires a rather different conception of what is entailed\nin a \u2018\u2018theory\u2019\u2019 of money than that which is envisaged by Ingham.\nThe abstract definition of \u2018\u2018money-of-account\u2019\u2019 that is cited above\nhas some striking affinities with Simmel\u2019s \u2018\u2018pure concept\u2019\u2019 of money. For\nSimmel (\uf731\uf739\uf737\uf738, p. \uf731\uf732\uf731), the essential idea of money is that it provides \u2018\u2018a\nsystem of measurement\u2019\u2019 against which all values can be quantified. In\nthis sense, money is a \u2018\u2018stable pole\u2019\u2019 (\uf732\uf732). But at this \u2018\u2018ideal\u2019\u2019 level,\nmonetary denomination does not \u2018\u2018lie behind\u2019\u2019 monetary medium in the\nway that Ingham suggests. Rather, they coincide. Crucially, Simmel\ncontrasts money\u2019s ideal durability with its actual fluidity. In his view,\nmoney is not only the stable pole but also the actus purus, i.e. \u2018\u2018a means of\nexchange which moves between tangible objects as does ether between\nobject possessing weight\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf731\uf732\uf732). As Hart describes it, Simmel\u2019s\ninterpretation of the unique role of money rests on the view that it\n\u2018\u2018represents an element of coherence in a world of constantly shifting\nprices\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf732\uf736\uf733). According to Hart (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730, p. \uf732\uf733\uf733), money is not\n\u2018\u2018one static thing or idea\u2019\u2019. He is right about the status of money as a\n(\uf732\uf732) He writes: \u2018\u2018money as abstract value\nexpresses nothing but the relativity of things\nthat constitute value; and, at the same time...\nmoney, as the stable pole, contrasts with the\neternal movements, fluctuations and equations\nof the objects\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. \uf731\uf732\uf731).\n\uf76e\uf769\uf767\uf765\uf76c \uf764\uf76f\uf764\uf764\n\uf734\uf730\uf738\n\u2018\u2018thing\u2019\u2019. But as an idea, money is remarkably durable in one vital res-\npect. For all the diversity of monetary media and denominations, Sim-\nmel\u2019s concept of money suggests that there is one feature that they have\nin common: they enable us to transform qualitative relations between\nvalues into quantitative ones. Whether money possesses paper or plastic\nform \u00a2 and whether it is denominated in US dollars, Ithaca hours, air-\nmiles or Nectar points \u00a2 all monies enable different qualities to be\ncompared in quantitative terms. In this respect, Simmel\u2019s approach to\nmoney has not lost its edge (\uf732\uf733).\nSimmel\u2019s analysis can embrace arguments about the diversity of\nmoney because it works on a generic level. As an idea, Simmel\u2019s concept\nof money presents a conceptual limit-edge against which all forms of\nmoney develop and take shape, however diverse they might be. For\nSimmel, money in its purest form is infinitely fungible: it can be\nexchanged with anything and everything. Money thus serves as a uni-\nversal means of quantifying value. But when conceived in this way,\n\u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 can never empirically exist. Nevertheless, all of the monetary\nforms which have been discussed in this paper \u00a2 large and small cur-\nrencies, different kinds of e-money, LETS tokens, Ithaca hours, and so\non \u00a2 can be classified as \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 according to Simmel\u2019s definition. At\nthe same time, none of them are equivalent to \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019. If not all dollars\nare equal, to paraphrase Zelizer, then no dollar is perfect. Simmel\u2019s\nconcept of money provides an ideal basis on which to treat money as a\ngeneric category. As such, it provides the flat surface on which the\ncomplex contours of the contemporary monetary landscape can be\nmapped out. The varying features of our monetary forms \u00a2 their fun-\ngibility, trustworthiness, ease of use, level of anonymity, and so on \u00a2 can\nthen be explored without implying that some are superior, others infer-\nior. Whether idealised as collective memory or denigrated as socially\ncorrosive, \u2018\u2018money\u2019\u2019 in its generic sense is a utopia \u00a2 a non-place where\nform and idea coalesce. Little wonder that it has proved so elusive for\nthose who have sought to encapsulate it in theory.\n(\uf732\uf733) Dembinski and Perritaz (\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730, p. \uf731\uf737\uf736)\nare therefore mistaken when they argue that\nwhat they call the \u2018\u2018break-up\u2019\u2019 of money ren-\nders Simmel\u2019s own treatment of money obso-\nlete. Their suggestion that Simmel was trying\nto understand the \u2018\u2018essence\u2019\u2019 of money is\nincompatible with the Kantian interpretation\nof his concept of money that I have proposed\nhere.\n\uf76c\uf761\uf775\uf76e\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf76d\uf76f\uf76e\uf765\uf779\n\uf734\uf730\uf739\nB I B L I O G R A P H Y\nB\uf76f\uf777\uf772\uf769\uf76e\uf767 F., \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738. \u2018\u2018LETS: An Eco-Socialist\nInitiative?\u2019\u2019, New Left Review, \uf732\uf733\uf732, pp. \uf739\uf731-\n\uf731\uf731\uf731.\nC\uf76f\uf768\uf765\uf76e B.
