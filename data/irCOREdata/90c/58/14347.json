Gordon and Paul Garrud\nBehavioural Sciences Section, Department of Psychiatry,\nUniversity of Nottingham, Medical School\nA new five-year course in communication skills for medical students has been developed at Nottingham\nMedical School in response to recommendations from the General Medical Council and a large body of\nresearch. As one foundation for this course, a multimedia CAL package was developed to aid acquisition\nof basic skills and associated knowledge. The CAL course uses extensive digital video for illustration,\nand relies heavily on interaction for learning. Evaluation of the CAL course has used a variety of\nmethods \u2014 pre\/post tests, randomized trials, and cohort comparisons. Given the investment needed to\nintroduce learning-technology-based courses, initial evaluation has been encouraging and has been used\nto improve later versions of the material.\nWhy do we need a new strategy?\nIn 1993 the General Medical Council (GMC) published Tomorrow's Doctors, a set of\nrecommendations for medical education. Much of this document was concerned with the\ntraining of communication skills and how this could be improved. This recommendation\nfollows decades of evidence about the importance of communication from many widely\nrespected medical teachers from every discipline:\nDoctors can discharge (their) important tasks effectively only if they possess the relevant\nskills. Unfortunately, many do not appear to acquire them during their professional training.\n(Maguire, 1981)\nThere appears to be a failure sometimes to notice what is really being said... the doctor\navoids the acute discomfort of being aware of a problem in which he would rather not get\ninvolved. (Norell, 1972).\nParticular deficits in the skills of both medical students and qualified doctors were highlighted,\noften showing that communication with patients got worse as training progressed!\nIt would appear that, as medical students move through their training, a certain degree of\ntheir innate ability to communicate with mothers of sick children seems to have been altered\nby their desire to obtain factual information. (Heifer, 1970)\n15\nShane A Gordon and Paul Ganvd Communication skills: a new strategy for training\nThis points to a failure of the traditional 'apprenticeship' model in teaching these particular skills.\nSeveral studies have now been conducted which show that specific training methods can\nproduce gains in particular skills (Truax and Carkhuff, 1967; Ivey, 1971). Research has\nidentified certain basic tasks and approaches which lead to unproved communication. These\ninclude addressing the concerns of patients other than their immediate physical complaint,\nexplaining terms and procedures in lay language, dealing with patients' anxiety,\nembarrassment and anger, and improving patients' recall and retention of information and\nadvice (Balint and Norell, 1973; Evans et al, 1993; Ley et al, 1976; MacKenzie, 1975; Scott et\nal, 1991; Uhlemann et al, 1982). Attention to these details, especially the last, has also been\npositively correlated with patients' compliance with advice and medication regimes.\nTomorrow's Doctors outlined 14 specific recommendations for improving doctors'\ncommunication with patients. We have based our new strategy around this core.\nAlso of increasing importance are diminishing staff-to-student ratios - from 1:8.4 in 1970 to\n1:11.3 in 1989 (AUT, 1991) - a trend which has continued. Ever tighter budgets, within which\nhigher education is forced to operate, also have a big impact. Medical schools are also faced\nwith the challenge of an ever more diverse student body to cater for: for example, greater\nnumbers of European Union and overseas students. It is hoped that the new strategy will prove\nboth more efficient in achieving its goals and more flexible in its provision for different modes\nand styles of learning.\nThe new strategy\nAt Nottingham a new five-year course in communication skills has been designed to replace\ntraditional teaching. This course integrates taught classes, seminars, clinical experience and a\nCAL package. This CAL is intended to provide basic knowledge and experience of the use and\nimprovement of communication skills.\nOur medical students arrive at Nottingham from a wide variety of cultural, social and\neducational backgrounds, and consequently there is considerable variation in their experience\nof communicating with different types of people and their level of skill. The CAL package is\nplanned to give them all enough knowledge and awareness of the subject so that they can begin\nto improve. The CAL material incorporates a selection of instructional methods and styles such\nas Mental Practice, Modelling, and Drill and Practice, providing immediate feedback on the\nstudent's actions. It provides a safe environment for students to learn and practise new skills,\nor improve existing ones.\nThe achievement of effective communication skills is assessed using the Objective Structured\nClinical Exam (OSCE) format. Communication skills are assessed objectively against\nvalidated behavioural checklists as an integrated part of a series of clinical tasks the students\nare required to tackle.\nHow are the new strategies incorporated into the CAL package? The CAL package consists of\nseven, 30+ minute units which are based on the GMC recommendations. These units are:\n\u2022 Opening an interview;\n\u2022 Eliciting patients' views and concerns;\n16\nALT-] Volume 4 Number I\n\u2022 Dealing with negative emotions;\n\u2022 Principles of communicating with patients whose first language is not English;\n\u2022 Summarizing and clarifying information;\n\u2022 Exposition of information and procedures;\n\u2022 Closing an interview.\nThis is not intended to be a comprehensive list, but these topics are relevant in the majority of\nmedical interviews and are commonly done poorly.\nEach topic is presented in a structured fashion, looking first at the importance of the topic to\nthe patient and the doctor (see Figure 1). It is then broken down into relatively straightforward\ntasks such as identifying verbal and non-verbal cues and suggested appropriate principles of\ndealing with the situation. The suggestions are not encyclopaedic, and the students are\nencouraged to analyse the material in ways which help them develop their own practices.\n\u00a5>:W::>:::::::w\nWhy is it important?\nPresentation to patients or\ncolleagues\n@ Checking for correctness and\ncompleteness\nFigure \/: A screen from the\nunit on summarizing and _ . . . .\nclarifying information, \u2022 Aid to memory\nillustrating the small amount\nof text used and the\nstructure of the information\nIn order to avoid information overload, the amount of text on the screen at any one time is kept\nto a minimum. Important details are presented as bullet points which can be clicked to play a\nvoice-over with more information (or displayed as text if the user wishes). Each unit is kept\nrelatively short and focused: students should finish each unit in about 30 minutes, well within\ntheir attention span.\nInteraction and discovery learning (where the student alters variables and predicts results) are\nused to encourage analysis of situations and practice of appropriate courses of action - an\nexample is shown in Figure 2.\nMost importantly, large amounts of video footage have been incorporated to illustrate\nsituations and provide models for the students - see Figure 3. These films were produced using\nactors and actresses, but the scenarios are based on our analysis of lengthy recordings of real\nconsultations.\n17\nShane A Gordon and Paul Ganvd Communication skills: a new strategy for training\nFor a History summary.\nFor a Management Plan,.\nClick on 4 phrases you would\nlike to include in the transcript.\nClick the \"Done\" button when\nyou have finished.\nSynopsis of Interview:\nMr. Willis has pains in his chest and is worried that he might\nhave cancer. He has had them for about four weeks. He has\nrecently moved house. Hfc is 56 years old. The pains are\nstabbing and sudden in onset. He is a farmer and is married with\nthree children. He has never smoked and drinks about 3 pints at\nweekends. The pain does not get worse with exercise.\nYour summary of Mr. Willis1 complaint:\nHe has has pains in his chest. He has had the pains\nfor about four weeks.\nReset\nWhat do 1 select for a summary?\nFigure 2: A screen where the user is asked to carry out a task identifying key information for a\nsummary\nHow are we evaluating this?\nOur first evaluation of this type of training was in 1993 when we compared two methods of\nteaching first-year medical students about non-verbal communication (Garrud et al, 1993). The\nstudy sample was large (N = 151), and subjects were randomly allocated to either a traditional\nlecture or a CAL package on the same material. The content of the CAL was agreed by the lecturer\nto cover the same material. All the subjects were then given a surprise test on their knowledge of\nnon-verbal communication. The test was set by the lecturer and the CAL authors jointly.\nThe package was used by 60 of the students allocated to it (80%), and the lecture was attended\nby 61 students (80%). Median usage of the CAL package was for 45 minutes (range 15-120\nminutes) with over half using it only once. Test scores ranged from 1.5 to 7.9 (maximum = 10)\nwith a normal distribution. Mean scores were: CAL group 5.2; lecture group 4.4 - a reliable\nsuperiority of CAL over the lecture (p<0.01). There was also a strong correlation within the\nCAL group between score and duration of use (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.45, p =\n0.0003). Overall academic achievement was compared for the two groups using end-of-year\nexamination scores - no significant difference was found (p = 0.32).\n18\nALT-] Volume 4 Number I\nFigure 3: An illustration\nof the use of digitized\nvideo in the course\n_ ^\nAnalysis of student evaluation questionnaires revealed that 95% of students found operating\nthe program easy. The majority of CAL users found that it enabled learning well, and was a\ngood use of their time.\nDuring the development of the communication skills CAL course, we produced a prototype\nunit and evaluated it using 11 volunteer students. Performance was analysed using a structured,\n11-point scheme (similar to those used in the end of year OSCEs). We also videotaped students\nusing the CAL package, and used this data (in conjunction with data automatically recorded by\nthe package) to analyse the ergonomics. Although the sample was too small to show any\nsignificant results, the ergonomic data allowed us to modify the packages to avoid commonly\nencountered problems such as difficulty in closing inset boxes to return to the main screen.\nIt is intended that a larger pre\/post test study (N>20) will be carried out on the full course. The\ndata from this will be compared with students' performance on other measures such as\ntranscripts of real patient interviews which they have conducted for other purposes, and their\nresults in the end-of-year examinations.\nBy the end of the year, all students in the first year (N = 170) will have had the opportunity to\nuse the CAL course. We intend to analyse student performance in the end-of-year OSCEs to\nexamine the relationships between duration of use, number of uses and overall marks. Results\nwill also be compared to last year's cohort who were not exposed to the CAL. This will\nprovide some medium term ( - 4 months) data.\nFinally, by monitoring students' use and re-use of the CAL course we will gain some insight\ninto the lasting popularity of the material as a learning resource.\n19\nShone A Gordon and Paul Ganvd Communication skills a new strategy for training\nConclusion\nIn developing a new strategy to cope with the changing nature of medical education, we have\nfound that computers can offer many advantages over traditional methods of teaching and\nlearning. The key benefits of CAL for training communication skills are:\n\u2022 a safe environment to practise communication where mistakes are not made with real\npatients;\n\u2022 a student-centred resource, allowing individual students to work on the aspects relevant to\nthem at their own pace; and\n\u2022 the use of multimedia exemplars, which the student analyses and interacts with. Our\nevidence so far suggests that the CAL resource helps students to improve their communica-\ntion in two ways - learning simple plans and procedures to tackle common communication\nsituations; and developing confidence to practise their skills in clinical settings.\nThere are also costs and limitations. This development used \u00a310,000 in funding, and took two\nyears from inception to delivery. The CAL course has yet to prove its cost effectiveness over\ntraditional methods (cf. Gibbs, 1993).\nIt is not intended that CAL should replace all traditional teaching on the course. It is another\nweapon in the educator's armoury and a powerful one, but it needs careful integration into the\noverall structure of a course. Overall, we feel that CAL provides sufficient added value to our\nteaching that it justifies its use in this course.\nReferences\nAUT (1991), Newsletter, Nottingham Association of University Teachers.\nBalint, E. and Norell, J.S.
