Introduction \nThe story of the financial turmoil that swept the world in 2007 and 2008 is now all too \nfamiliar. What started out as a geographically highly concentrated housing crisis \nturned into a global economic recession that reached into the nooks and crannies of \nthe global economy. Global banks invested their assets in a range of financial \nproducts on offer in multiple international financial centres spread across the world \nand then securitised the gambles made in one market by selling repacked \ncollateralized debt obligations (CDOs) to investors in other markets, thus creating \nintricate webs of spatial interdependency (Tett, 2009). The \u2017new international \nfinancial system\u2018 (Strange, 1994) and its inherent dependency on trading across space \nas part of a search for yield thus created a topological map that brings Amsterdam, \nBoston, Chicago, Frankfurt, London, New York, Paris, Tokyo and perhaps more \nimportantly than ever Hong Kong, Shanghai, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and other now \n\u2017emerged\u2018 (and no-longer emerging) financial centres into shared spaces of financial \ninterdependency. As a result, spatial interconnectivity has appeared to be a self \nstanding cause through which the crisis was (re)produced, something ripe for \nexploitation by financial geographers as part of a project to heighten the profile of the \nsub-discipline\u2018s research.  \n                                                 \n1\n The title of this paper draws on Peter Dicken\u2018s suggestion that economic geographers \u2017missed the \n  \nEmblematic of the role of geography in the crisis is the story told by Aalbers \n(2009) about the city of Narvik in North West Norway. This sleepy town, that at first \nglance appears as far removed from Wall Street and the City of London as possible, \nfound its municipal authority effectively bankrupt in late 2008 because of investments \nin residential mortgage backed securities, issued by the US bank Citigroup, that had \nbecome worthless in the sub-prime meltdown. Another example is the losses incurred \nby Asian and Middle East sovereign wealth funds that bought into bulge bracket \ninvestment banks at the top of the cycle. These agents have since 2000 become major \ninvestors in firms domiciled in the homelands of international finance. It was the \nreputation of the \u2017bulge bracket\u2018 investment banks more than intimate knowledge of \ntheir asset books that steered their investments. Yet reliance on reputation, and the \nresultant attraction to apparently reputable institutions which were already seen to be \ncrumbling by co-located insiders, has led to major losses that have been felt across \nAsia and the Middle East. Both examples, as French, Leyshon and Thrift (in press) \npoint out, show how we are experiencing a \u2017very geographical crisis\u2018.  \nThe cause and effects of the crisis have thus clearly demonstrated the \nrelevance of financial geography to a sector that was seen by many as having lost its \nreal world moorings, shaped and kneaded as it was by virtualization, digitization and \nthe creation of hyper-mobile, globally attractive yet indecipherable products. As \ngeographers have long-argued, financial globalization is a process that reasserts and \nsimultaneously reconstructs the importance of the national scale, not least because of \ninternational finance\u2018s reliance on a \u2017patchwork\u2018 of national regulatory systems \n(Thrift and Leyshon, 1994; Martin, 1999; Sassen, 2006; Tickell, 2000). Reflecting \nthis, the immediate responses to the crisis, while global, have been innately \ngeographical thanks to the continued role of the state in relation to regulatory efforts \ndesigned to offset the crisis\u2018s impacts. In addition, the imagined futures post-crisis are \nalso innately geographical. One particular example of this stands out amongst all \nothers: the public debate, led by world leaders, central bankers and others, about the \nneed for and negotiation and implementation of transnational reregulation. This is not \nglobal regulation; the need for national implementation of any future transnational \nregime is recognized, in particular because the resurgence of the state\u2018s role in the \neconomy in 2007 and 2008 and the marked reassessment of the appropriateness of \n                                                                                                                                            \nboat\u2018 in terms of the globalization debate in the social sciences (2004). \n  \nneo-liberal doctrines of light touch regulation, state roll-back and global free markets. \nSuch debates have long been at the heart of geographical analyses of finance and, now \nmore than ever, there seems, therefore, to be an opportunity to emphasise financial \ngeography\u2018s role in understanding and identifying ways of reforming financial \nsystems. The rise, fall and future ascension of finance invites us to reflect upon the \nimplications both at home and overseas of a reliance on a post-industrial, service and \ninevitably finance-based economy that has become simultaneously global and local, \nvirtual and material.  \nA number of commentaries in geographical journals (Sidaway 2008; Wojzcik, \n2009; Taylor, 2009), as well as a number of earlier contributions discussed here, have \nrevealed that geographers do indeed have much to say about the financial crisis. But \nthe crisis has also inspired other disciplines within the social sciences to take spatial \nvariables more seriously and to colonise what could and arguably should be \ngeographers turf (see Amin and Thrift [2000] for evidence of the recurrent nature of \nthis concern). So how do we ensure that the rise, fall and future rebirth of finance is \nnot going to be geography\u2018s \u2015next missed boat\u2016, to paraphrase Peter Dicken (2004)? \nThat is the question to which this introduction to the special issue on financial \ngeographies is dedicated. Below we consider the opportunities and challenges raised \nby the financial crisis for financial geography before outlining how the papers in this \nspecial issue develop existing and open up new avenues of research that in different \nways relate to those opportunities and challenges.  \n \n2. Future opportunities and challenges \nIn this section we sketch out three problematics \u2014 productivism, epochs and \nrationality \u2014 that guide much geographical work but that are questioned by the rise of \nfinance and studies by financial geographers over recent years. The aim is not to \ncriticize but to constructively identify the opportunities that the credit crisis and \ncurrent debates about financialized capitalism provide to ensure that the work of \nfinancial geographers is recognised and continues to develop as a unique and \npowerful tool for analyzing the current crisis and financial futures. \n \n3.1 Beyond productivism \nAs Allen Scott (2000) has argued, economic geography in a very deep sense has been \na post war undertaking, reflecting the concerns of societies confronted with the task of \n  \nsocial, political, economic and moral reconstruction after the meltdown of the wars \nbetween 1914 and 1945. Unsurprisingly, this post-war effort emphasized \nmanufacturing and, most recently, the (re)discovery of regions and industrial districts \nin the 1980s and 1990s as part of a search for models of effective industrial \nproduction. This legacy, both negatively and positively, still determines many \ngeographical research agendas and whilst the importance of studies of manufacturing \nis not be disputed, and whilst it is clear that a healthy body of research on services has \nemerged over the past twenty years not least in relation to world cities (Beaverstock et \nal., 2000), the credit crisis opens up opportunities to locate the study of financial \nservices at the heart of research in economic geography. \nThere is, of course, a risk at this point in time in calling for more economic \ngeographical research of services and financial services in particular. \nDeindustrialization and reliance on a service economy has been questioned, not least \nin the UK, as jobs have been lost as a result of the credit crisis and questions about the \ndangers of a \u2017boom and bust\u2018 \u2017virtual\u2018 financial economy have resurfaced. But this \nshould not prevent economic geography from developing more research focussed on \nfinance. For a start, the distinction between the real and the financial economy is \nuntenable. Most simply, any manufacturing economy is intimately related to the \nfinancial economy, both because of the need for credit but also because of the \ninfluence of stock markets and shareholder value logics on management strategy \n(Froud et al., 2006). Moreover, as Leyshon and Thrift (2007) note, \u2017the capitalization \nof everything\u2018 whereby assets and businesses assumed to be outside the realms of the \nmarket \u2014 public infrastructure for example \u2014 are put up for sale and through \ninvestments tied to the rhythms and demands of financial markets, further reveals the \ngrowing difficulties of economic geographical research that ignores finance.  \nThe financial crisis has drawn attention to such issues and the pervasiveness of \nfinance and hence provides an opportunity to enhance financial geography\u2018s status \nwithin economic geography, a vital stepping stone to ensuring the sub-discipline\u2018s \nwider relevance within the social science community. Most simply, then, we need a \ncritical mass of researchers engaged in analysis of the post-industrial service economy \nwhich has finance at its heart. Restricting empirics to the production and consumption \nof goods that, in the memorable phrase of The Economist, 'can be dropped on one\u2018s \nfeet', risks estranging economic geographers from the real drama of our time; the \nintrusion of finance into all elements of economic life. And this growing relevance of \n  \nstudies of finance also creates opportunities for theoretical stimulation in relation to \nsome of the fundamental interests of geographers. Again this does not mean rejecting \nearlier work that does not focus on finance. Rather it means identifying and promoting \nthe many ways that studies of finance can contribute to core geographical and social \nscience debates of the moment. \n \n3.2 Beyond epochs \nIt is a clich\u00e9 that time and history matter. Indeed, the current interest in evolutionary \neconomics and evolutionary economic geography (see Boschma and Martin 2007; \nFrenken and Boschma 2007; Grabher, 2009) highlights the importance of longitudinal \nanalysis in economic geography. Exemplifying this issue further, economic \ngeographers played an important role in the academic debate about how different \nphases of capitalism should be conceptualized, as is demonstrated by the reception \nreceived by the French regulation school in economic geography as well as the \nenthusiasm with which economic geographers threw themselves at the exercise of \ncategorizing contemporary capitalism as either post-Fordist, neo-Fordist, post-\nTaylorist, neo-Taylorist or something else altogether (Harvey 1989; Amin 1994). In \nthe context of our discussion here, debates about financialization are arguably the \nlatest and most relevant stage in geographical attempts to categorise the nature of the \neconomy at any particular moment (see Leyshon and Thrift, 2007).  \nFocussing on such epochal stages is, of course helpful, not least because it \nforces overt consideration of the change over time that helps differentiate the \ncontemporary financial system from previous incarnations. Indeed, one of the most \npopular pastimes of media commentators since the start of the credit crisis has been \ncomparison with the great depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s with those \nacademics able to compare the current recession to previous ones being in great \ndemand. But it is important not to get carried away with such analyses and let change \ndominate discussions. There is a danger that epochal narratives struggle to distinguish \nbetween rupture (often over-emphasized) and continuity (see Peck and Tickell, 1994), \nsuggesting that it is empirically more adequate, although conceptually more awkward, \nto replace an epochal view of history with a multilayered conceptualization of time in \nwhich different strands of reality have different time spans and different speeds of \ntransformation, allowing scholars to do justice to our simultaneous experience of \ncontinuity and change.  \n  \nSuch careful conceptualisation of change over time is one of financial \ngeography\u2018s real strengths and again is something that seems ripe for further \ndevelopment in future years. Whether it be studies that document change over time in \nparticular places such as the City of London (see Leyshon and Thrift, 1997), in \nsystems such as pension fund capitalism (Clark, 2000) or in scales of financial \npractice (French, 2000; Hall, 2007), financial geographers have shown themselves to \nbe adept at negotiating an analytical path that reveals important developments, the \ninfluence of historical legacies on such developments and also the forms of continuity \nthat continue to inflect finance in any one place at any one time. So the City of \nLondon has been shown to have become more meritocratic but, as Leyshon and Thrift \n(1997) suggest, this change has not led to a wholesale clearing away of the \u2017old boys \nclub\u2018 and the Oxbridge elitism that defined the City in the past. Pension fund \ncapitalism has been shown to have spread globally, but not without evolution in the \npractice because of the influence of diverse national institutional contexts which have \nthemselves evolved over recent years but which are far from internationally \nhomogeneous (Clark, 2000). Globalization has been shown to tie international \nfinancial centres such as London and New York together into a single world of \ninternational finance, but trading in each city is reliant not just on global but also local \nconnections which mean the global and local together define situated financial \npractices (Hall, 2007). \nFurther developing such subtle analyses seems likely to be an important future \nendeavour and can place financial geography at the heart of social science debates. \nHere Braudel\u2018s three pronged conception of time could be a fruitful source of \ninspiration (1982; see also Sewell 2008), whilst Sassen\u2018s (2006) suggestion of holding \nconstant the unit of analysis (in her case territory, authority and rights) and \ndocumenting how the unit has changed but retained legacies from the past offers an \nequally useful approach. Both of these approaches, and the existing work described \nabove, suggests that financial geographies which are historically situated and focussed \nnot on the epochal but the conjectural and the way elements of both continuity and \nchange need explanation offer a way to develop powerful analyse that are relevant to \nacademic and policy debates.  \n \n3.3 Beyond rationality  \nDebates about the strengths and weaknesses of the invocation of homo economicus \n  \nand assumptions about rational actors in work on finance are not new (see Amin and \nThrift, 2000) and the credit crisis and the way the gambles of apparently reckless \nfinanciers led to the downfall of a number of major banks has only further highlighted \nthe need to better understand what influences the actions of those working in finance. \nOne of financial geography\u2018s defining features over recent years has been just such \nwork, with emphasis placed by a number of scholars on concepts that offer ways of \ntheorising the multiple influences on the actions of financiers. One example of this is \nthe importance placed on tacit knowledge ('buzz') to explain the continuing relevance \nof proximity and co-presence in certain situations (Faulconbridge et al., 2007; Gertler, \n2003; Hall, 2008; French, 2000; Storper & Venables 2004). One of the aims of such \nwork has been to argue that the rationalist view of tacit knowledge as knowledge that \nsimply has not yet been made explicit is misleading. Instead it is suggested that \nlearning always involves the development of capabilities that remain tacit and which \nare developed through complex processes of socialization in everyday human action. \nAs a result, it has been argued that for financiers\u2018 tacit knowledge, developed in \npractice and often through embodied experience of particular situations, is vital and \nacts as ineffable, personal, situated and supremely practical as well as supremely \nimportant knowledge that informs actions (D\u2018Eredita and Barreto, 2006).  \nFocussing on the importance of tacit knowledge has the potential to reveal the \nunpredictability of financial agents and the implications of this both for practice and \nregulation. Indeed, the importance of studying the tacit dimensions of knowledge and \nits role in explanations of behaviour is currently receiving support from unexpected \nsources, namely from the mixture of economics and social psychology that goes by \nthe name of behavioural economics, suggesting a fruitful research program at the \nboundary between economic geography and social psychology (see Clark 2010; \nKahneman and Tversky 2000; Akerlof and Shiller 2009). This is not surprising. If we \naccept that we act against a background in which tacit knowledge is important, then \nwe have to admit that most of our so-called \u2017choices\u2018 result in part at least from \nconventions, affects or emotions (including greed!) learned in an ongoing fashion \nthroughout our lives. The credit crisis is the ultimate example of such influences on \nthe actions of financiers and shows how rational actors fail to exist, thus revealing the \nneed to take seriously the tacit dimensions of decision-making in explanations of and \nmost importantly regulatory assumptions about financial agents.  \nAdopting such a view of human agency will imply a hard break with habit for \n  \nsome. But for financial geographers the acceptance of such logics and the \ndevelopment of future research designed to enhance understanding of the forms of \ntacit learning that condition that actions of financiers in practice is simply a natural \nprogression from earlier research.  \n \n3. The special issue \nThe above discussion outlines a number of opportunities and challenges for financial \ngeographers that, whilst not new, have been brought centre stage by the credit crisis. \nThe papers in this special issue do not, however, all explicitly study the crisis itself.\n2\n \nInstead they identify key theoretical and empirical areas of research that financial \ngeographers have been developing of late that are relevant to the current and future \nchallenges associated with the credit crisis. In doing this they all demonstrate in \ndifferent ways the importance of moving beyond productivism in research. At the \nsame time, they offer new insights into why moving beyond epochs and rationality is \nalso valuable.  \nThe special issue begins with three papers that broadly deal with the \u2017practice\u2018 \nof finance. Here, as well as the value of mocing beyond productivism, we see clear \nconnections to the value of moving beyond rational economic man and developing \nmore detailed understandings of the construction of financial subjects in order to do \njustice to the insights recently generated by behavioural economics. The paper by Hall \nand Appleyard reveals that financiers \u2017learn\u2018 in ways that are simultaneously \nembedded in local and transnational industry spaces. Hall and Appleyard show that \nbankers are not a species unto to itself but are raised and groomed in particular \neducational spaces that are clearly pockmarked by the national scale and its \ninstitutional trajectory. Specifically the spaces and communities in which bankers \nlearn to \u2017do finance\u2018 influence their practices in ways that question the existence of \neither a global system of \u2017doing finance\u2018 or homogenous corporate ways of working \nin global banks.  \nThe paper by Dixon and Monk, in explicitly highlighting the importance of \nintegrating geographical and historical contingency into discussions of finance, offers \nnovel insight into the international proliferation of defined benefit pension schemes. \n                                                 \n2\n The special issue originates from a session at the 2008 Association of American Geographers Annual \nConference in Boston and, as such, the original discussions were not able to take into account the \nspectacular and devastating events in financial markets in mid to late 2008. \n  \nUsing the examples of the Netherlands and the UK, Dixon and Monk examine the \ngeographically heterogeneous socio-technical system that led to the differentiated \nadoption of transnational best practice in pension provision by actors in different \ncountries. This reveals, as highlighted earlier in relation to the financial crisis, the \nimportance of understanding the effects of transnational systems of governance in \nrelation to finance and, in particular, the continued institutional diversity that such \nsystems both negotiate and produce and the influence of such diversity of the actors \n\u2017doing finance\u2018. In this paper the emphasis is, then, on the contested and contingent \nnature of the production of pension subjects and the historical legacies that influence \ncurrent practices. \nThe paper by Faulconbridge and Muzio, finally, examines how the logics of \nfinancialized management, designed to enhance shareholder value, have spilled-over \ninto the legal industry. Showing that moving beyond productivism is vital because of \nhow financial logics have to be understood to explain strategies in an ever growing \nrange of industries, Faulconbridge and Muzio reveal the way law firms have \nrestructured to enhance year on year financial performance in the context of particular \nplace and time specific discourses and institutional legacies that shape the behaviours \nof those running large law firms. \nThe three papers forming the second half deal, in different ways, with the \ngeographically uneven impacts of finance and the role of geographically \nheterogeneous structural and institutional forces in determining this impact. The paper \nby Mullerleille, adopting the theme of financialization, considers how the aircraft \nmanufacturer Boeing underwent a period of \u2017reorientation\u2018 driven by shareholder \nvalue logics, leading to the geographical relocation of the firm\u2018s headquarters as part \nof attempts to change corporate cultures. Highlighting the intimately geographical \nnature of financialization and the consequences for different worker communities in \nthe USA, Mullerleille shows that bringing studies of finance and manufacturing \ntogether to move beyond productivism is the only way to explain present day \nindustrial organization and dynamics. \nThe paper by Engelen and Grote highlights the power of geographical analyses \nof finance to overcome some of the limitations of studies that fail to consider either \nhistorical or contemporary geographical influences on the financial economy. Using \nthe examples of Amsterdam and Frankfurt as two international financial centres that \nhave suffered decline over recent years, Engelen and Grote reveal the analytical limits \n  \nof economists\u2018 \u2017New Economic Geography\u2018 and of \u2017Comparative Political Economy\u2018 \nand suggests that geographers\u2018 synthesizing abilities which allow a conjectural rather \nthan epochal focus to be developed through consideration of temporality, institutional \ncontext and relationality are vital for explaining the evolving and geographically \nuneven map of the financial system.  \nThe paper by Zademach, finally, deals with the controversial issue of private \nequity and financialized models of management by considering the impacts of outside \nfinancial investment on a leading firm in the Munich film and television cluster. In \nfilling an empirical gap, namely the lack of studies of finance\u2018s impacts on firms and \nplaces outside of leading international financial centres, Zademach questions the idea \nthat financialized management always has a detrimental impact on the long-term \nsuccess of a firm.  \nThe special issue concludes with a commentary co-authored by Roger Lee, \nGordon L. Clark, Jane Pollard and Andrew Leyshon. The mandate they had was \nnothing more restrictive than a set of reflections upon the meaning of the crisis for \nfinancial geography and the role of the papers that make up this special issue in \ndeveloping new lines of research. Their comments, of course, do not converge, based \nas they are in different biographical soils and emphasizing different aspects of the \nchallenges of the crisis for financial geography. They should, though, inspire more \ngeographers to shift their focus of research to finance, a phenomenon that has proven \nto have ramifications for the lives of all of us that are so significant that it cannot \nbecome geography\u2018s \u2017next missed boat\u2018. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAalbers, M. 2009.
