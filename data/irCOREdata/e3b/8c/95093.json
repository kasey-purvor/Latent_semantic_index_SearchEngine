How best to achieve these outcomes has been the focus of considerable debate, \nbetween supporters of minimalist finance-only and services-plus approaches, between the \nmerits of client oriented models and member ownership. Many approaches to microfinance \nnote the importance of participation within peer groups, the potential for empowerment and \nthe support given by civil society organisations. Few studies however have analysed the \nnature and extent of participation, or whether this participation can be understood as \ndemocratic. In this article we examine four communities in South Africa that belong to a \nVillage Bank, an organisation that promotes member ownership and control. The article \nexamines members\u2019 experiences of participation, and specifically organisational transparency \nand conflict resolution. We argue that microfinance holds considerable normative and \nsymbolic appeal to members but that participation in practice has been limited.  \n \n \nKeywords: Microfinance, Participation, Village Banks, South Africa \n \n  \nIntroduction \nIn the past two decades advocacy for microfinance has \u201cgenerated enthusiasm bordering on \nhysteria\u201d with supporters and critics alike pointing to the evangelism of donors, civil society \norganisations (CSOs) and some academics (Mosley and Hulme, 1998: 783). The international \npolicy calendar has become choked by microfinance related events, from the World \nMicrocredit Summit in 1997, the UN International Year of Microcredit in 2005, the 2006 \naward of the Nobel Peace Prize to Mohammed Yunus, and activities to demonstrate \nmicrofinance\u2019s role in the delivery of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (UN, \n2005). Multi- and bi- lateral development institutions have increased funding to microfinance \nprogrammes and banks such as Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro have lent large \nsums. Against what seemed to be a na\u00efve hope in the mid 1990s that microfinance institutions \n(MFIs) would be able to leverage over $US 20 billion in order to reach 100 million of the \npoorest people by 2005, some estimates suggest that these figures have been surpassed (ADL, \n2008; UN, 2005).1 The number of MFIs has increased dramatically to over 3,000 (Robinson, \n 1\n \n \n2001) and the World Council of Credit Unions claim almost 50,000 groups with 177 million \nmembers (WOCCU, 2009).  \n \nAlthough forwarded as a technical exercise in innovative banking practice micro-finance is \nnot divorced from the \u2018politics of development\u2019, even if it has not been subject to explicit \nscrutiny from a politics perspective. With major international development institutions and \ndonors searching for pro-poor interventions with a minimum of state involvement, MFIs were \nable to claim, and with some justification, to reach poor households, to assist the alleviation of \npoverty by reducing vulnerability to cyclical or unexpected crisis, and provide assistance with \nshort-term consumption needs (Copestake et al., 2001, Hulme and Mosley, 1996, Matin et al., \n2002 although see Amin et al., 2001, Hulme, 2000). Microfinance\u2019s potential for inverting the \nconventional resource pyramid by bringing the previously considered \u2018unbankable\u2019 poor into \nthe \u2018mainstream\u2019 of financial services has been characterised as \u201cfinancial democracy\u201d by the \nInter-American Development Bank (2005) or, through support to micro-enterprises, to what \nUSAID refers to as a process of strengthening the \u201cinstitutions of economic democracy\u201d (see \nCohen, 2002).  \n \nThese rather nebulous terms elude to a political economy in which MFIs serve as \n\u2018intermediaries\u2019 between individuals, communities, other civil society and financial sector \norganisations, and strengthen access to markets. How far this intermediary role should extend \nbeyond the confines of banking \u2018good practice\u2019 has been the subject of considerable debate \nwith some writers advocating a finance-only \u2018client knows best\u2019 or institutionalist position, \nthat promotes MFI sustainability, and others arguing that provision of services such as \nbusiness training enhances the effectiveness of microfinance and delivery of welfare \n(Morduch, 2000, Robinson, 2001).2 Both views, however, have resonated with a broad church \n 2\n \n \nof ideological standpoints towards development, from advocates of business models, \npromoters of less state or more decentralised intervention, and claims for greater roles for \nCSOs, and have been consistent with related conceptual shifts, such as from human to \u2018social \ncapital\u2019 and women in development to gender empowerment approaches (see Dalgic, 2007, \nRankin, 2002, Weber, 2002). \n \nAmidst the considerable \u2018noise\u2019 surrounding microfinance, there has been little discussion of \nthe relationship between or implications for micro-finance of democratic practice and \nparticipation. Robinson (2001: 40) does note that large-scale sustainable microfinance may \nhelp create an enabling environment for greater political participation and democracy but the \npoint is not followed up. The omission is surprising considering the promotion of MFIs as \nnon-state actors, the obviously political nature of the claimed effects in terms of, for example, \ngender empowerment, and institutional claims to practices which include participation and \ntransparency, subject to light-touch regulation. In this paper we explore the political \ndimensions of MFIs as intermediaries, and in particular members\u2019 cognisance of concepts \nsuch as democracy and participation. To do so we look in detail at a member-based \nmicrofinance organisation in South Africa called Village Banks. Based loosely on the FINCA \nmodel developed by John Hatch and influenced by the South Africa agrarian co-operative \nmovement, Village Banks support membership rather than client-ship, with local oversight \nand democratic practice.3 Our principal interest is to scrutinise to what extent participants \nbelieved themselves to be \u2018owners\u2019 and how far their views held influence over local group \ngovernance. Rather than consider MFI participation in isolation however we wanted to \nexplore the political embeddedness of member involvement, how the Village Bank sat within \nother civil society structures, including local institutions such as traditional authorities. In \nthese circumstances how far is it reasonable to expect \u2018banking\u2019 to be participatory or \n 3\n \n \ndemocratic, or for microfinance to enhance the \u2018space\u2019 for inclusive community structures to \nemerge?  \n \nFor any society these questions should be important, but are especially so in South Africa \nwhere CSOs and community based organisations were in the vanguard to resistance against \napartheid and the layers of exclusion experienced by low-income, black, households (CASE, \n1998, Heinrich, 2001), and where the \u2018democratic\u2019 government\u2019s record of poverty alleviation \nand attempts to reduce social and racial inequality has been criticised (Habib and Taylor, \n1999, Niksic, 2004). In Section II we examine the prima facie case for the association \nbetween civil society, and micro-finance specifically, and more inclusive participation and \ndemocratic practice. In Section III we outline the importance of MFIs to the provision of \nfinancial services in South Africa and a brief overview of Village Banks. We then discuss, in \nSections IV and V, how members of Village Banks assessed its record against a meter of \nparticipation and conflict resolution. We argue that while members of the Village Banks \nvalued the opportunity to participate in their local branch, and held some high ideals for \ngovernance practice, they understood that practice fell short of expectation. Their comments \nreveal Village Banks to be less member and more client oriented, with daily operations \ncircumscribed by the power relations with tribal authorities.  \n \nMicrofinance, Participation and Democratic Practice \nIt is important to position microfinance within debates concerning critical understandings of \nprocesses such as participation and empowerment. Microfinance has become a key dimension \nof development practice in a context of democratic \u2018deepening\u2019 and as CSOs have pressed to \nincorporate ideas of participation into policy (Hadenius and Uggla, 1996). Nevertheless, there \nare calls to reappraise the definitions, discourses and achievements of key terms such as \n 4\n \n \n\u2018participation\u2019 and \u2018empowerment\u2019 that are according to Cornwall and Brock (2005) \u201cwarmly \npersuasive\u201d buzzwords that convey no fixed meaning but rather a facility to communicate a \nsense of conviction and consensus to how development should take place. Despite their \ntechnocratic resonance, when deconstructed these terms are revealed to be highly ambivalent \n(what they call \u201cfuzz-words\u201d), are sometimes employed to contradictory ends, and which \nblock off other ways of expressing problems and solutions (also Kapoor, 2002). Others have \nwarned of the dangers of cultural relativism and have argued for more analysis of \u201cactually \nexisting civil society\u201d rather than ascribe normative attributes of participation in practice \n(Lewis, 2002, Williams, 2004). As a battery of authors note, CSOs in practice can fall short of \ntheir own ideals, relying upon bounded rules and disciplined forms of participation with \nlimited opportunities for spontaneous dialogue (Cooke and Kothari, 2001, Hearn, 2001, \nWhite, 1999). \n \nAn issue of particular concern has been expressed for the ways advocacy for and studies of \ncivil society\u2019s participation and empowerment potential invoke \u2018the local\u2019 which, as Mohan \nand Stokke (2000) note, is often employed as if co-terminous with \u2018community\u2019 and in ways \nthat obfuscate power relations. A lack of cognisance to local power structures, notably to \ncustomary arrangements, and worse if it is assumed that \u2018local cultures\u2019 are somehow even-\nhanded and consensual, threatens \u2018elite capture\u2019 and the darker sides of social capital \n(Khwaja, 2004). This critique is salutary for South Africa where there has been considerable \npressure to incorporate civil society into policy-making and service delivery, as well as \ntensions between the political expediency of enhancing the representation of traditional \nauthorities in local politics and a disquiet that \u2018resurgent\u2019 traditional institutions will be \ninimical to gender empowerment, the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, and freedom to \nexpress dissent and extend rights (Beall, 2005, Beall et al., 2005). \n 5\n \n \n \nIn these circumstances we need to consider carefully the \u2018political\u2019 claims sustained by \nmicrofinance advocates and research. Here we focus on the two most prevalent claims. The \nfirst argues that microfinance builds upon mutual solidarity, trust and the reciprocal flows of \ninformation, enhancing the best features of embedded institutions such as rotating savings and \ncredit associations (Bennett et al., 1996, Chiteji, 2002). Researchers have noted, however, \nextension officers expending considerable effort to \u2018recruit\u2019 members and maintain group \nmembership levels with gifts and rituals such as songs and prayers (Matin et al., 2002, \nMontgomery, 1996, Reinke, 1998). Officers have also been shown to discourage default by \nthreatening the confiscation of goods and physical intimidation, or imposing rules to deny \nmember access to savings in order to inhibit members from \u2018voting with their accounts\u2019 \n(Chiteji, 2002, Montgomery, 1996, Rahman, 1999). A number of authors indicate that even \nwhen group solidarity appears to be encouraged there is rule-setting to create \u2018business like\u2019 \nmeetings, and efforts to channel discussion of social and  political issues away from general \nmeetings and to dedicated workshops (Fiebig et al., 2002, Montgomery 1996). Despite the \ncentrality of solidarity to the microfinance story, it is remarkably unclear how we expect \nparticipation to be constructed and how we might take account of power relations and \nconflict. \n \nA second claim is that access and use of financial services, and engagement with linked social \nprogrammes where available, raises opportunities to exercise agency or empowerment within \nhousehold and community decision-making (see Bernasek, 2003, Mahmud, 2003). A version \nof this argument is that group or membership networks may serve as forum for discussion of \nissues from domestic violence, sexual rights, nutrition, independent money management, and \nwider political participation (Goetz and Gupta, 1996, Mayoux, 2001). There is evidence of a \n 6\n \n \ntransformation of gender roles due to participation in credit programmes, with a reduced \nlikelihood that women would be beaten by their partners (Schuler et al., 1996) and greater \nopportunities for groups to gain opportunities for income generation without sanction from \nmen, community, religious or caste leaders (Bernasek, 2003). Nevertheless,  the record would \nappear to be mixed. Studies note that women\u2019s participation has been a surrogate for men to \naccess finance, that male-on-female violence may increase in situations of \u2018stress\u2019 or as \nwomen challenge patriarchal structures (Bernasek, 2003, Goetz and Gupta, 1996, Mahmud, \n2003, Mayoux, 2001). Despite these concerns, however, relatively little ethnographic work \nhas emerged that looks at the discussions taking place within member groups or how the least \nempowered within conventionally excluded groups such as the elderly gain their \u2018voice\u2019. \n \nGaining critical insight into the experience of group solidarity (and liability) and \nempowerment may appear to be moot given that some commentators identify a \u201csecond \nrevolution\u201d in microfinance whereby the new emphasis is to treat members as \u2018clients\u2019 or \n\u2018customers\u2019 rather than members or \u2018owners\u2019 (Fiebig et al.,  2002, Woller, 2002). \nNevertheless, while a number of high-profile MFIs \u2013 notably the Grameen Bank and FINCA - \nhave dropped group solidarity\/liability from their modus operandi, the vast majority of MFIs \ncontinue to use a membership structure and\/or stress the importance of participation and \ninvolvement in institutional management. Indeed, even in client oriented institutions, Cohen \nargues that \u201c\u2026nothing can replace the voices of the clients and the importance of ongoing and \nupward flows of information to enable institutions to be more responsive\u201d and \u201c..also brings \nbenefits that can improve the bottom line\u201d (2002: 342). This approach is predicated on an \nappraisal of the costs of participation to the MFI that retains a vertical transmission of \ninformation rather than encourage horizontal and extra-group linkages, or a concern for the \nwider effects of participation or democratic practice on empowerment. But as the \u2018second \n 7\n \n \nrevolution\u2019 encourages membership and participation to wither we should consider how \nmembers have experienced participation in a situation where it has been encouraged.  \n \nFinancial Services and the Case Study Communities \nSouth Africa\u2019s commercial banking sector was set up to serve the country's high-income \npopulation and corporate sector, but until the early part of this decade left nearly 60% of the \npopulation and especially the black African population \u2018unbanked\u2019 (Nigrini, 2001, Paulson \nand McAndrews, 1998). The reasons for this market and institutional failure have been the \nsubject of repeated regulatory reforms, establishment of public wholesale finance institutions \nand introduction of ATM technologies to encourage banks to go \u2018downmarket\u2019 (Kirsten, \n2006, Paulson and McAndrews, 1998). In 2008 close to 38% of households remained \n\u2018unbanked\u2019 with services especially deficient for the poor, non asset holders and those living \non tribal lands (Finmark, 2008, Kirsten, 2006). Without access to financial services there are \nfew methods of keeping cash secure. One woman in a case study community stated that her \nmother used to put money in a tin can which would be flattened and hidden under a rock, and \nanother woman described how people would wrap their money in an old cloth that would then \nbe stitched inside clothing, \u201clike an old cloth inside her body\u201d. Many respondents mentioned \nthat these methods would lead to the money being damaged, found and spent by children, \nforgotten about or stolen. It is hardly surprising that respondents to a Participatory Poverty \nAssessment identified access to financial services as vital to their ability to deal with poverty \nand cover consumption shortfalls without recourse to moneylenders or intra family borrowing \n(Van de Ruit et al., 2001). As anyone who has witnessed a \u2018pension day\u2019 will attest, the \ndifficulty of saving in secure forms encourages immediate consumption.4  \n \n 8\n \n \nMFIs have set up in unserved areas but most people use a range of embedded \u2018informal\u2019 or \nsemi-formal financial organisations. Perhaps the best known is the stokvel (also known as \ngooi gooi, mogadisano or umgalelo) which operates as a rotating savings scheme through \nregular payments over a given cycle from which members can either make withdrawals on \ndemand, usually subject to group approval, or by an agreed rotation. Many variations of \nstokvels exist, including as burial societies, to accumulate lobola (marriage wealth) or to draw \ndown remittance incomes from migrants working away (Nigrini, 2001). The National \nStokvels Association (NSASA) calculates about eight million South Africans are stokvel \nmembers making contributions of R1 billion per month. Alarmingly, the newspapers regularly \nreport on stokvels collapsing. The alternative to a stokvel is a credit union, locally managed \norganisations capitalised by members holding shares and paying a user fee to make or \nwithdraw deposits. Unlike the stokvel, unions do not require members to meet on a regular \nbasis and there is no rotation component. Members may organise independently to apply for \ngroup credit, but loans are not made on the basis of group solidarity and supervision is usually \nlimited to oversight of accounts by, for example, the Savings and Credit Cooperative League \n(SACCOL) (see Schoeman et al., 2003). \n \nOur research looked at a hybrid credit union called Village Financial Services Co-operative, \nknown as Village Banks. As the name suggests Village Bank emerged from the co-operative \nmovement but was formally established in 1994 in North West Province with financial \nsupport from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and regulated by The Financial Services Association (FSA) that \nwas also charged with providing staff training and to develop new financial products (IFAD, \n1997, Schoeman et al., 2003).5 The Village Bank concept aimed to encourage poor people to \nsave either individually or as a stokvel, with the branch depositing funds at a \u2018link bank\u2019 to \n 9\n \n \nensure against theft and to provide an audit trail. Member funds would be accessible on \ndemand by individual account holders although for larger sums, in the case of a burial society \nfor example, a few days notice would be required. The fees for deposits and withdrawals were \nexpected to cover the salary of a day-to-day administrator (IFAD, 1997). The FSA received \nfunding from the Department of Welfare to expand operations, and by 2002 there were 62 \nbranches with R80 billion deposits and perhaps as many as 80,000 members. When further \nfunding for the FSA was denied, prompting the Association to collapse in 2004, Village \nBanks were left to operate independently.6\n \nIn principle, the governance of Village Banks was to be democratic and participatory, with the \nbranches owned and managed by their members who would be shareholders: each branch \nwould be capitalised by the purchase of one share per member (costing R10 at time of field \nresearch) with no gate keeping to determine \u2018ownership\u2019 according to income, job or gender \nfor example. Shareholding qualified each person with the right to vote for a board of \nmanagement that would be responsible for the recruitment of an administrator, determine the \nbalance between cash and deposits, approve loans, set fees, and compile the annual accounts \n(Nigrini, 2001). The boards are subject to the scrutiny of the shareholders through an annual \ngeneral meeting and extraordinary meetings where called by a quorum of shareholders (IFAD, \n1997). The original idea was to build upon local institutions and support solidarity within the \ncommunity, and to respond to beneficiary needs in a transparent manner (IFAD, 1997). As \nsuch, Village Banks aimed to ensure that members \u2018own\u2019 their branch and participate in its \nmanagement, thereby promoting democratic practice internally as well as a broader sense of \nempowerment. In a context in which most South Africans are reported not to trust \u2018informal\u2019 \nsavings and lending groups (Porteous, 2005), the oversight offered by Bank membership, \n 10\n \n \nparticipation in Board selection, decision-making and account approval should be important \nboth to bank function and member financial security. \n \nFieldwork to assess the democratic and participatory record of Village Bank was conducted in \nfour communities in order to capture a diversity of social, political and cultural contexts. The \nfour communities were selected taking into account demographic profile, length of Village \nBank operations and services offered. At the time of fieldwork, Village Banks were located \nprincipally in KwaZulu-Natal (seven branches), North West, Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape \n(six branches each), with two branches in Limpopo. Most branches were located in areas that \nranked among the poorest nationally either by measures of income-expenditure or \nvulnerability attributes (May, 1998). In KwaZulu-Natal we selected Bhambanana, located 22 \nkilometres from Ingwavuma and 38 kilometres from the regional hub of Jozini both of which \npossessed branches of Ithala, a provincial development bank. Bhambanana had a petrol \nstation, two Cash & Carry\u2019s, two liquor stores, one supermarket, one caf\u00e9, and a fruit and \nvegetable market. The Bhambanana Village Bank opened in June 2000 and there were 3,060 \nmembers drawn from a 25-50 kilometre radius. The branch offered savings accounts, fixed \ndeposits and a funeral scheme, which was only being utilised by 15 people, and they had just \nstarted offering loans to small businesses. The branch had approximately R290,900 in \ndeposits held at First National Bank, and charged of R1 for every R100 deposited, R2 for \nwithdrawals less than R100 and R1 per additional R100. \n \nThe second site was Motswedi situated in the North West province near the border with \nBotswana and 35 kilometres from Zeerust. The branch was opened in 1996 and during \nfieldwork had 1,451 account holders, accessing savings, fixed deposits and funeral scheme \nbenefits. State old age pensions and disability grants were also paid directly into the accounts \n 11\n \n \nwhich held approximately R1.8 million. Motswedi was referred to by the FSA as a \u201csuccess\u201d \nbecause of its level of accumulated deposits. The third community was Sakaletfu, located in \neastern Mpumalanga close to Malelane (25km), and consisted of a number of densely \npopulated townships. The Sakaletfu Village Bank started in 1999 and had 515 account \nholders. Eligible account holders were able to have pension and disability payments \ntransferred directly into accounts, and the branch had begun to provide loans (36 people had \nloans up to R200 repayable over four months). Finally, Mathabatha situated in Limpopo near \nto Lebowakgomo township and 80 kilometres from Polokwane was chosen. The Village Bank \nwas formed after one of the board members heard of the concept at a meeting in Kgautswane \nand the community supported her idea, officially opening a branch in May 2000. Mathabatha \nVillage Bank had 279 account holders. No charges were made on deposits but a R3 charge \nwas levied on withdrawals between R10-500 and R6 on withdrawals over R500. The Bank \nhad deposits worth approximately R47,000. \n \nIn each of the communities focus groups were organised with separate groups for men and \nwomen, and with participants of different ages, educational attainment and vocational status. \nA third focus group was held with the board members, in order that branch members would \nnot feel intimidated to speak at their meeting, and a fourth focus group was organised with \npensioners.7 Focus groups were prompted to discuss the meaning of democracy in general \nterms before moving on to discuss how participants understood the rules and constitution of \nVillage Bank, how they engaged with the branch on a day to day basis and through more \nformal decision making. The research did not attempt to suggest a particular definition of \ndemocracy or participation, and nor did we expect that experience of Village Banks would \nmeet the wishes of all members or that everyone would have the same relationship with the \nbranch. Conversations were encouraged about how the Village Bank compared to other \n 12\n \n \norganisations within the community in the expectation that participants might recognise the \nbranch as being owned and managed by its members. A broad set of questions were asked \nabout people influential within the local branch, the election of board members and feedback \non how the board made decisions. We wanted the focus groups to discuss how or if Village \nBanks provided an opportunity for members to express their wishes and concerns among \nthemselves or to the board, for diverse and even contradictory social interests to be expressed, \nand if consensus was reached for these views to be acted upon. We were interested as much \nby the range of opinion and how ideas of bank operation were expressed as whether views \nwere unanimously held. \n \nThe Experience of Participation \nNot surprisingly, on the subject of democracy responses varied widely across the groups. \nPeople from at least one group in each community made reference to broader concepts such as \nequality, freedom of expression, freedom of rights and freedom from oppression. Some went \nso far as to assimilate the concept of democracy to freedom itself and one pensioner from \nMathabatha stated that \u201cDemocracy is Unity\u201d - a relatively non-specific synonym in the South \nAfrica context lifted from political slogans. Others referred to relationships within their own \ncommunity. The Motswedi Men\u2019s group commented, \n \nI think democracy means the system at which government is transparent in this \ncommunity, including the freedom of speech, including transparency at which they \nrespond to the community in time. \n \nSome made direct reference from general discussion to the Village Bank without being \nprompted. A common sentiment was that the whole community was involved in the \nestablishment of the Village Bank, therefore it was democratic, and because the branch \nallowed anyone to join without needing a job. \n 13\n \n \n \nIt is important because I am able to open a bank account for my child, I do not have a \nformal job or a payslip but that did not stop me from opening a bank account at the \nVillage Bank. The Village Bank does not have rules that stop me from opening a bank \naccount. The other banks have rules that prohibit people who do not have payslips from \nopening accounts with them; here anyone could open an account at anytime. \n(Mathabatha Women) \n \nThere were some signs that groups were aware that inclusivity was a challenge to the status \nquo. Describing non members as richer households who wanted ATMs and regarded a Village \nBank as beneath them one group stated: \n \nThey have no confidence in us. They want to see us working with the computer. They \ndon't trust us with our pencils and paper, they say their money is not safe. (Bhambanana \nBoard) \n \nResidents from Mathabatha seemed most vocal and confident in their understanding of \ndemocracy and how it applied to their lives, with some groups drawing detailed links between \nthe transparency and accountability of the Bank and democratic principle. \n \nIn the light of the Village Bank, it is a concept that was developed by the people for \nthemselves. They have full access to all information regarding the bank; they have the \nright to demand the financial statement of the bank at any time without fear. It is much \neasier to address a person that you know on a personal level. If at the end of the day a \nperson feels a sense of ownership as well as belonging and is comfortable with the set \nup, that to me describes democracy. (Mathabatha Board, emphasis added) \n \n \nThe diversity of this general discussion already revealed tensions that would be more evident \nlater. In Motswedi, for example, the board members offered a limited interpretation of \ndemocracy \u201cas freedom\u201d, whereas participants of the male and female focus groups gave \ndetailed and personal descriptions of the concept. \n \nResponses to the meaning of participation followed a similar pattern. Members from \nBhambanana stated that participation meant \u2018being involved\u2019, to work together and to get \n 14\n \n \nalong with people. Members of the board from Mathabatha discussed how various clubs, \nassociations and surrounding communities were using the branch. The board members from \nSakaletfu discussed participation in terms of \u201cmaking a contribution\u201d whilst the women\u2019s \ngroup said that it involved co-operation with other people. Similar themes emerged from \nMotswedi, where mention was made of working together and taking part in community \ndevelopment.  \n \nI think participation deals with, amongst other things, transparency. I mean if the \nmanagement of the community is not more transparent to this community I do not think \nthe community will speak more into what they decide. So I think if there is \ntransparency, there is also participation. (Motswedi Men) \n \nYet when prompted to discuss the relationship between the shareholders and board members, \nand who made decisions and how, some focus groups became confused, a precursor to what \nwas later to be revealed as an uneven picture of participation and inclusivity. Most groups \nwere able to recognise the role of board members and offered some indication, seemingly \nmore an aspiration, that the shareholders ultimately took decisions:  \n \nIt gives me power to put forward my suggestions and if I get support from fellow \nshareholders it would mean we could implement them. (Bhambanana Men) \n \nIt gives me the right to ask questions if I am dissatisfied about something. (Bhambanana \nWomen) \n \nIn the case of Mathabatha, the board members and women\u2019s focus group seemed to concur. \nThe decisions are announced through the Chairperson but in any association there is a \nprotocol and policies as well as administrative matters. In terms of administrative \nmatters the Bank Manager sees to that.. When it comes to the policies of the bank, the \nshareholders are the main decision-makers. We as the Board Directors, we act on what \nthe shareholders want, the decision making process is not centred on certain individuals. \nIt comes from the ground until it gets to the administration and the chairperson. \n(Mathabatha Board) \n \nIn other instances considerable disagreement was expressed. The women\u2019s group at Motswedi \nfor example discussed a deep-seated unhappiness with the board,  \n 15\n \n \n \nThe Village Bank operates properly, but we have a problem with the board. Normally \nthese people in the board don\u2019t consult the community members, they are the ones who \ndecide what to do about the Village Bank who should do this and who should be doing \nthis. (Motswedi Women) \n \nThe board members recognised that some decisions might require community input but that \nthey have the authority to make decisions.  \n \nDiscussion of Village Bank governance revealed an ambivalent picture. Each branch was \nsupposed to have an agreed constitution which one group related directly to a sense of \nownership:  \nWe have our own constitution, which is different from their constitution [commercial \nbanks]. The other banks don\u2019t meet up with their clients to solve the problems. The \nmembers know everything about the bank. We want to see this bank develop. (Sakaletfu \nMen) \n \nAs might be expected, board members gave more detailed responses and were able to identify \nsomething equivalent to a constitution. Board members from Mathabatha stated that their \nconstitution was similar to that recommended by the FSA, whilst the Bhambanana and \nSakaletfu boards mentioned that the constitution described the different responsibilities of the \nboard members. The board members from Motswedi however discussed a range of rules that \nthey claim were written down but not discussed with members. These rules spoke to the \nexertion of board control over the communities, preventing members from forming new \nbranches for example. Yet, most focus groups were unaware of any constitution, interpreting \n\u2018rules\u2019 as referring simply to opening and closing times, the use of an ID book and the \ndifferent fees levels. The men from Motswedi and the pensioners from Bhambanana both \nemphatically stated that there was no constitution whilst the men from Bhambanana and the \npensioners in Sakaletfu said there was one but they knew nothing about it.  \n \n 16\n \n \nFurther discrepancy emerged to challenge the claimed \u2018membership\u2019, and corresponding \naccountability, of Village Bank. It was revealed that not all account holders were shareholders \nand vice versa. Thus, for example, the Sakaletfu Board commented: \n \nIt\u2019s very important to have the Village Bank. People have something that they can \nidentify as their own thing. This bank has an intention to develop this community. The \nother banks, like Standard Bank serves the interest of the White people. The community \nis empowered and they appreciate that they own the Village Bank. (Sakaletfu Board)  \n \nSuch an ethos might explain why Sakaletfu Village Bank had 515 account holders but 580 \nshareholders. By contrast, in Motswedi there were only 237 shareholders compared with \n1,451 account holders and in Mathabatha there were 279 account holders but 216 \nshareholders.8 Some of the focus groups commented on their confusion as to the distinction \nbetween accounts and shares. \n \nSince I am not educated, when I went to open an account I was just told that I should \nalso buy shares as well and I did. But I did not understand what it meant. I did not even \nthink about asking. (Mathabatha Women) \n \nThe Village Bank model stipulates that account holders own a share, and may hold more \nwithout gaining additional voting rights or obligations. Hence it is possible for there to be \nmore shares than accounts but not more shareholders and not more accounts than shares. \nExtending availability of accounts without the requirement of shareholding might be \ninterpreted as a sensitive response to the limited income of potential members \u2013 participants \nof the Sakaletfu women\u2019s focus group had mentioned a lack of income as one reason why \nsome did not have shares - and a desire to raise account numbers. However, the experience of \nMotswedi indicates a less generous explanation. The men\u2019s focus group revealed that the \nboard had stopped the purchase of shares a number of years ago. As this discussion went on \nmembers of both the men and women\u2019s focus groups began to change their comments \nregarding the \u2018democratic\u2019 nature of the Village Bank. The men in particular now felt strongly \n 17\n \n \nthat the board was running the branch and criticised the control exerted by elders closely \nlinked to the traditional authority. In reappraising some of their earlier views they argued that: \n \nI think democracy in the village is a controlled one because we are not exercising some \nof our rights, most of the people who are here, all the decisions are taken by the tribal \npeople. (Motswedi Men) \n \nThe elders of the village are the ones who elect the board. After they have been elected \nthey are told to lead us. \u2026We are oppressed by the members of the board, they don\u2019t \ngive us the right to say anything. That is wrong and it is unfair. (Motswedi Women) \n \nThe board defended the decision but confirmed the suspicion that controlling membership \nwas functional to wider political interests. \nInitially when we started, we only allowed people who resided in Motswedi to buy \nshares. But we came to a point where we decided to spread our services to the \nneighbouring villages, since there were a lot of demands from them and they wanted to \nbecome members of the Village Bank. It was then up to the board to decide whether or \nnot we should sell shares to members of the neighbouring villages as they will be \nstanding a chance of being elected as members of the board of directors. Then the board \ndecided that we can\u2019t sell shares to the people from neighbouring villages, we rather sell \nto the people who reside in Motswedi, in case [of] problems. When you have shares, \nyou can be a member for a period of 12 months unless the board rules you out on certain \nconditions that will be known to that particular client and the board, so they could stand \na chance of being elected. We don\u2019t want to be governed by somebody from outside. \n(Motswedi Board) \n \nIn this particular case governance was determined by relations with the embedded institutions \nof the tribal authority and their perceived need for autonomy. \n \nWith question-marks hanging over the governance of Village Banks it was important to \nconsider if people felt their opinions were heard and taken into account by boards. In all \ncases, however, it was clear that few meetings ever took place. In Mathabatha, and to a lesser \nextent in Sakaletfu, there had been meetings and confidence was expressed that opinions were \nheard and acted upon. The Sakaletfu men\u2019s group noted that meetings involved discussion, \nwith the floor open to whomsoever wished to contribute. But when asked about what kinds of \nissues came up for discussion few concrete examples were offered. Indeed, the unevenness of \n 18\n \n \nthe record casts doubts on the quality of participation. Pensioners in Bhambanana for example \nclaimed to have no knowledge of who formed the board, the protocols for meetings, or could \nconfirm if there had been meetings. Instead of meetings the branch administrator was \nidentified as the principal channel of information between board and members. In Mathabatha \nthe administrator had taken it upon herself to produce a quarterly statement that was given \nverbally to shareholders due to a shortage of paper and widespread illiteracy. Account holders \nseemed to appreciate the effort the form this information sharing took: \nThere is respect from the employees in the Village Bank whereas in other Banks there is \nno sense of respect where they do not use the language that I would understand. \nSometimes they call us \"Grandmother\" and \"Aunty\", it\u2019s an insult. (Bhambanana \nWomen) \n \nThe sense of ownership through participation therefore is related to social relations with the \nadministrator rather more than a conscious effort to promote shareholding and dialogue. \n \nBranches in two communities stand out as operating according to more democratic and \nparticipatory principles. In Sakaletfu the board had held its second elections in February 2002 \nand at the same time presented a financial year-end report. About half of the shareholders had \nattended the meeting and a vote took place via nominations and a show of hands. The \nprevious elections had been in 2000, with no election in 2001 because the chairman had \navoided calling one. When it was revealed that the chair had borrowed money without \npermission from the branch the board was pressured to hold elections, which removed the \nchairman from office, an event that raised awareness among the board members of their \nresponsibilities to hold elections. Moreover, since the removal of the chairman, it was claimed \nthat there had been a growth of interest in the branch and the new board was actively \nencouraging the purchase of shares, including as a form of investment. A similar picture \nemerged in Mathabatha that had also experienced its second election in January 2002. \nAccording to the board, the election was attended by shareholders who had voted via a show \n 19\n \n \nof hands and this had brought some changes to board membership. Current board members \nfelt that people would not re-elect those who had under performed.  \n \nAlthough the experience of Sakaletfu and Mathabatha might be considered participation \nredux, an even more cautionary insight is offered by the other two communities. The \nMotswedi branch had not held an election since the board was established in 1996 because, as \na board member explained, while the original intention had been to limit service to one year it \nwas felt that board members were learning how to do their job and branch stability was \nparamount. Yet, descriptions of the only election to have been held in Motswedi from two of \nthe focus groups argued that no vote to elect the board had taken place and the board had \nappointed itself based on members\u2019 position in the traditional authority. Subsequent to this \n\u2018election\u2019, the men and women\u2019s groups said no shareholder meetings had ever taken place \nalthough intriguingly the pensioners stated that shareholder meetings did take place.  \n \nThe chiefs (Amakhosi) were also instrumental in the formation of the board in Bhambanana. It \ntranspired that the board was constituted in May 2000 at a meeting which, according to board \nmembers, was called by the Department of Social Welfare, the FSA and the chiefs. At the \nmeeting, the purpose of the Village Bank was explained by the representatives of the \nDepartment of Social Welfare and the FSA, and those attending were requested to elect the \nboard. Members then pointed out various people, stating that they wanted certain people on \nthe board and, apparently, agreeing that the board should include representatives from each of \nthe four traditional authorities.9 Retrospective accounts of participation at this meeting were \ndivided. The women\u2019s group mentioned that they participated in the election process, but the \nmen\u2019s group made no mention of it, and the pensioners stated that they were not present and \nseemed indifferent. No subsequent election has taken place, no annual shareholder meetings \n 20\n \n \nhave been held and no dividends have been paid. The continued control of the tribal authority \nin Bhambanana and Motswedi was reflected in the gender and age composition of the boards \nwhich were all male in the case of Motswedi, where most of the board members were over the \nage of 70, with the eldest being 82, or possessed only one female member (the administrator) \nin Bhambanana. Sakaletfu had two women on the board and Mathabatha had five women on \nthe boards including the chairperson.  \n \nConflict Resolution, Traditional Authority and Autonomy \nA reasonable test of actually existing participation is how an organisation resolves conflicts. \nIdeally, there should be procedures in place and widely known about to deal with conflict or \nmisconduct in a timely, fair and transparent manner. When asked, however, participants were \nunable to identify a procedure that should be followed should a conflict arise with only the \nMathabatha women\u2019s focus group describing a series of warnings from the board to a possible \nwrongdoer. In Bhambanana, the board members opined that concerns would be raised first \nwith the administrator who in turn would notify the board if s\/he could not resolve the issue. \nThe obvious difficulty here is that the absence of shareholder meetings makes sanctions \nemanating from the board unaccountable. Hence, in all four case studies we learned that \n\u2018discipline\u2019 depended upon the status of board members with the traditional authorities. In \nMotswedi the board claimed that disputes would be taken to the chief who had attended the \nfirst meeting of the members to indicate that the bank would \u201crun smoothly\u201d. Similarly, \npensioners in Mathabatha believed that the chief would be called in to deal with conflict and \nin Sakaletfu it was suggested that the board resolved problems but the Izinduna (headmen) \nwould attend such a meeting. \n \n 21\n \n \nThe symbolic and coercive power of the tribal authority might provide legitimacy to forms of \ndispute resolution in the absence of more participatory methods of branch governance \ngenerally. From the example of disputes, however, such a view appears optimistic. In \nMathabatha, participants expressed dissatisfaction that they had not been informed when the \nbank had been robbed and blamed the board for the lax security. The response of the board \nindicated a concern with textbook procedure. \nNormally, if it is a security problem, the person in charge of security would inform the \nChairperson of the Board and the Chairperson would pass the information onto the \nboard where it will be discussed. But if it were a security issue, we would have to take \nmeasures that would reach the shareholders regarding what happened. In the case of a \nrobbery for instance, after the Head of Security informed me, I am the Chairperson, I \ntold the Board of Directors and we discussed the issue and opened a case. We then \nreported it to the shareholders where we gave them a report of the incident. We are \nresponsible and accountable to them, so we must take initiatives to their advantage. \n(Mathabatha Board)  \n \nBut the comments from the other focus groups suggest this procedure had been followed, or \nnot quickly enough, and despite the apparent reassurance of \u2018correct\u2019 practice implicit in the \nquote the reference to \u201cNormally\u201d hardly inspires confidence.  \n \nWe have already noted how boards and tribal authorities maintained close, occasionally \nalmost indistinguishable, relations. In the case of Motswedi one effect had been the exclusion \nof people from outside the immediate village from the purchase of shares and both women \nand men\u2019s focus groups claimed a degree of \u2018capture\u2019 by older members in how the bank was \nrun. As one group put it: \n \nI think they are the rich people because most of [them] are pensioners. You see that is \nmy worry that what I say will last. We\u2019ve got to change this board because they are all \npensioners, they are earning money every month and they don\u2019t worry about the \nprogress, they don\u2019t even know that the money we save, we save it to develop \nsomething but not to save the money to be proud that we have money. [In] my view the \nmoney that the bank is making it is made so that it should develop the youngsters, it \nshould not be collected to be a lump sum of money that has got no use. (Motswedi Men) \n \n 22\n \n \nIn both Motswedi and Bhambanana views were expressed that the banks beholden to football \nclubs and burial societies that held deposits with the branch. \nBecause they [Burial Societies] are taking their income to save here and they withdraw \nat the time when they need the money. That is how they influence the Village Bank. \n(Motswedi Men) \n \nIn Mathabatha by contrast, the traditional authority appeared to have less influence: \nHe [the chief] does not have the power to control how the bank should be managed. His \nresponsibility is to see that the community and the Village Bank have a good working \nrelationship as well as to ensure that the community is satisfied with the Village Bank. \nIf he were to realise that the two parties were not working well together, then he would \nintervene. (Mathabatha Women) \n \nIn Sakaletfu and Mathabatha it was stated that the bank held its autonomy from local \ninstitutions, whereas in Motswedi and Bhambanana the embeddedness of the branches within \nlocal institutions appeared to be a simmering dispute that undermined claims to ownership \nand participation.10  \n \nConclusions \nAlthough occasionally referred to as a \u2018movement\u2019 microfinance is not usually included in \neither celebratory or critical accounts of civil society. The sense is that MFIs are not \npolitically progressive and despite claims to empower and in some cases operate in \nparticipatory ways, microfinance institutions\u2019 convenience or complicity to the neoliberal \nagenda suggests an inherent conservative ethos. Yet, MFIs represent important agents in civil \nsociety, possess rapidly growing numbers of members or clients, and are able to mobilise \nsignificant resources. Moreover MFIs exist within, and indeed rely upon, other \u2018local\u2019 \nembedded institutions and may be networked to private commercial banks nationally and \ninternationally, multi- and bi-lateral donors, church groups, trade unions and co-operative \nmovements, as well as government agencies while being \u2018non-state actors\u2019. Conspicuous by \nits absence in the research on civil society, there has been similarly little attention afforded to \n 23\n \n \ninvestigating the quality of participation from researchers principally interested in \nmicrofinance. \n \nWhile Village Banks does not profess to follow the peer group methodology associated with \nmany MFIs, and nor does it burden members with regular meetings or \u2018bonding\u2019 exercises, it \ndoes claim to be owned by its members and to be democratically organised. Village Banks is \nnormatively client led through shareholding, information exchange and the regular election of \nboard members. Our research looked at how far these procedures had meaning to Bank \nmembers. The focus groups articulated ambitious understandings of what democracy meant, \nincluding notions of freedom, equality and unity, and some, if few, links between these \nconcepts and the specific \u2018belonging\u2019 to or working of Village Bank were drawn. Specifically, \nmembers felt that the Bank was democratic because the community had participated in its \ninception although this was not actually true. However, participants rarely described \nthemselves as owners and some claimed that the focus groups were the first occasion they had \nreflected upon their relationship with the branch. The principal reason why \u2018ownership\u2019 was \nnot more strongly felt appears linked to the uneasy relationship between board members and \nthe rights of shareholders. This was evident in Motswedi where a number of account holders \ndid not know that they were entitled to shares. In this instance, the board members had altered \nthe rules to protect their interests which involved the deferment of decision-making to the \ntraditional authority, although this was a feature of all four communities to some extent.  \n \nDoes this mixed record of participation and transparency matter? At one level democratic \nstructures within an MFI should make little difference to the delivery of financial services and \nseeking the opinions of members at every turn would impose transaction and opportunity \ncosts which will be most keenly felt by the poorest. It is revealing perhaps that Motswedi has \n 24\n \n \nthe most impressive savings record despite not having held a board election since its inception \nin 1996. Nevertheless as the best capitalised of the four banks, with substantial funds held at \nthe \u2018link bank\u2019 earning interest all \u2018members\u2019 as shareholders should receive a useful \ndividend. So far as we could establish no dividend had ever been paid, effectively meaning \nthat the deposits of poor savers were funding the operation of the branch when funds might \nhave been better used. Of course, were a dividend to be paid the decision of the board to deny \nshareholding to non Motswedi residents would have had a punitive material distributive \noutcome. \n \nWhile people in the four communities therefore placed value in \u2018democratic banking\u2019 as a \nnormative ideal the record of MFI governance suggests significant failings in participation \nand quality of oversight. At best, as expressed in the focus groups, the daily engagement with \nan MFI such as Village Banks presented members with a low quality \u2018political space\u2019. In part \nwe can explain this condition in terms of the embeddedness of the banks in the power \nrelations determined by the tribal authority, and with consequent effects in terms of deferment \nto age and gender in decision making. Bank governance was not fundamentally autonomous \nfrom local institutions, it rather reflected them. This leads to the paradoxical situation in \nwhich the poorest people in our villages were women and those men who had not moved \naway for work, the better off were older men and pensioners more generally. While all were \npotentially \u2018unbanked\u2019 their inclusion into a membership oriented organisation was unequal, \nwith the poorest given the least voice in how their resources should be managed. This \ninequality of outcome was not a matter of design but it was a feature of how Village Bank \ndesign was operationalised, with the FSA overseeing the initial formation of the banks in \nclose cooperation with the tribal authorities, and its subsequent inability to regulate \noperations. \n 25\n \n \n \nFinally, if the experience of the banks is at all generalisable to other cooperative or \nmembership styled organisations then the identified shift from membership to clientship as \nannounced by the so-called \u201csecond revolution\u201d may capture the intentions of donors and \nlarge umbrella MFIs but is less adequate as a means to appreciate what is happening in \n\u2018actually existing civil society\u2019. In practice members of Village Banks seem to have been \ntreated as clients, and not terribly valued ones at that, almost from the outset. The discussion \nin the focus groups, and additional conversations with administrators, revealed pride at the \nachievement of establishing a banking organisation, at maintaining savings deposits and \nsupport for the relative security and accessibility that the Village Bank offers poor \nhouseholds. For now, peoples\u2019 experience of participation however suggests that catchy terms \nsuch as \u2018financial democracy\u2019 should be considered open metaphors rather than accurate \nlabels of microfinance\u2019s political dimensions. \n \nBibliography \n \nAD Little (ADL) Consulting (2008) Microfinance on the Rise, Unpublished report, [online at: \nhttp:\/\/www.adl.com\/reports.html?view=329] \n \nAmin, S., Rai, A.S. and Topa, G.

They elect their own leaders, select their own members, create their own \nbylaws, do their own bookkeeping, manage all funds, disburse and deposit all funds, resolve \nloan delinquency problems, and  levy their own fines on members who come late, miss \nmeetings, or fall behind in their payments\u201d (Hatch, 2004). \n \n4 Means-tested pensions are received by over 80% of age-qualifying African households who \nreceive a sum equivalent to about 50% of average household income. On pension days people \nwait for hours for the truck with an ATM machine welded to the back and armed guards. \nEven before funds are distributed sites become itinerant markets mostly selling clothes, \ndomestic goods and food. \n \n5 A separate support system for Village Banks was provided by FINASOL, established by the \nSouth African Sugar Association\u2019s Financial Aid Fund, and which operated a franchise \narrangement in which FINASOL took a stake in the branch (Schoeman et al., 2003). \n \n6 Personal communication, David de Jong, FSA Regulator, South African Microfinance Apex \nFund, Department for Trade and Industry, Government of the Republic of South Africa, 10 \nMarch 2009. Almost simultaneously FINASOL also collapsed. \n \n7 Groups were facilitated by field staff of Development Research Africa, a private research \nconsultancy, with meetings conducted in local languages.  \n \n8 There may be a different but equally alarming discrepancy in play in Bhambanana where a \nsurvey conducted by Dallimore in 2002 could only locate 85 account holders within five \nkilometres of the town when the bank claimed over 3,000 members. Although attrition in all \nfour banks was significant the more likely explanation is the bank had encouraged set up of \n\u2018ghost accounts\u2019.  \n \n9 It was argued that the high number of members in Bhambanana was partly because the \nInkosi (traditional leader) had instructed everyone to buy shares. \n \n10 The sense of greater autonomy from the chief in Mathabatha seems largely contextual as he \nwas described as a drunk and lacked credibility generally. The claimed involvement of the \nchief in event of dispute seemed more likely here to deference to the office than to the holder.  \n 30\n"}
