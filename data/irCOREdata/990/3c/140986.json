INTRODUCTION \nRoad traffic accidents, and the associated economical and social costs, are a major health \nproblem in most countries today. Throughout accident research history, the search for \npredictors of accident involvement has been a central focus of investigation (see for \nexample reference 1). Although a vast number of parameters (psychological, \ndemographic, medical etc) have been tested (for reviews, see 2-6 and the meta-analysis 7) \nno strong associations have been found (e.g. 8).  \nMany organisations are concerned about the frequency with which their employees are \ninvolved in road traffic crashes, but there is, in comparison to car drivers, little published \ndata to guide company policy and professional driver training. This paper aims to 1) re-\nvisit two of the most persistently found accident predictors; age and experience but within \na professional group of drivers that are less well understood compared with car drivers; \nthat of bus operators and 2) we aim to consider methodological approaches to \nunderstanding crash risk that do not seem to have been studied before for any groups of \nprofessional drivers. \nBus drivers are a special group of professional drivers that differ markedly from the \npopulation of car drivers in ways that are likely to affect their crash risk. Firstly, bus \ndrivers already hold a car driving licence before being granted a bus driver\u2019s licence and \nalso start driving a bus work at a later age than novice car drivers do. While it is possible \nthat this is beneficial, currently there is no evidence to indicate that this is the case. On \nthe contrary, no association has been found between years of holding a car driver licence \nand number of bus crashes (9). \n 4  \nSecondly, bus drivers have the added pressure of responsibility for passengers' lives \ndriving large, heavy vehicles that are constantly pulling in and out of traffic, mostly in \nbuilt-up areas. Thirdly, bus drivers have a much higher annual mileage than private \nmotorists. Finally, organisational factors such as bus schedules are likely to exert a strong \ninfluence on their driving behaviour. \nAge and experience are known to be predictive of road traffic collisions for car drivers \n(e.g. 10) but as these predictors are usually highly inter-correlated and are difficult to \nseparate when investigating crash risk (11-14). For age, mileage adjusted crash risk \ndeclines with age but then rises again for drivers aged over 65 (15). This is thought to be \ndue to physical and cognitive declines in older people and higher risk-taking in younger \ncar drivers (16-18). Even limited driving experience has a major effect on road safety, as \nthere is a disproportionately higher crash rate during the first year of driving for car \ndrivers, particularly in the first few months after licensure (19). Mayhew et al (20) found \nlarger decreases in crash risk amongst younger novices compared with older novices \nduring the first few months of car driving. There is thus a reasonable literature on the \neffects of age and experience on crash involvement for private motorists, but little is \nknown about whether these results can be generalised to professional drivers.  \nTurning to professionals, crash risk is greater for drivers who drive for work, even when \ntaking into account their increased mileage (21). For bus operators, the same general \nfindings as those pertaining to car drivers have emerged, although the literature is not as \nprolific. Generally, accident risk is found to decrease somewhat with increased age and \nexperience, both having independent impacts (22), especially at the low end (23) \nalthough in some studies only one of these have been a significant predictor (9, 24, 25). \n 5  \nAlthough some effects of age and\/or experience can almost always be found in crash risk \ncalculations, there exists an inherent problem in such data; the matter of culpability for \ncrashes, which is often not taken into consideration. As all drivers are exposed to events \nthat are due to other drivers' behaviour, studies that use all crashes as the dependent \nmeasure, instead of culpable ones, probably underestimate the effects of their \nindependent variables (studies which have found this effect include 26-29). \nRegarding source methodology, many studies use official accident data to examine crash \nrisk (e.g. 12, 18, 22, 30). These databases most often have the advantages of being large \nand collected over a long time period, but under-reporting and various biases have been \nshown to exist by many authors (e.g. 31-38). Other studies are limited by small sample \nsizes (e.g. 39), while the extremely popular self-report measure of crashes is seriously \nflawed in various ways (15, 29, 40-45).  \nCompany fleet crash data on the other hand have advantages over official archives, and \nare probably more complete than other sources (42). However, they may suffer from \nother problems. Data are often collected for insurance purposes and are concerned with \npolicies and claims rather than crash and driver characteristics. Here, the problem of \nculpability returns, because even though such data may be available, the correctness of \nthe criterion and the actual coding may not be accurate. \nThere are many ways to assess the crash risk associated with different types of road user. \nOften, the driver is used as the unit of analysis and age, experience and crashes over a \ncertain period of time is correlated, which can be called a direct analysis. However, as \ncrashes are rather rare, the statistical power of such an analysis is often low. An \nalternative to this method is to start with crashes, and compare the characteristics of the \n 6  \ndrivers with those of the general driving population. However, using all drivers as \ncomparison is crude, and will probably lead to confounding of different effects, like that \nof exposure. Therefore, several researchers have suggested using what is called induced \nexposure techniques on accident data, producing relative risk ratios, where the number of \nnon-culpable accidents is used as an index of exposure. This method is based on the \nassumption that in two-vehicle crashes there is a driver who is responsible for the \ncollision and that the second driver is selected randomly from the driving population (46, \n47). The culpable and non-culpable drivers can thereafter be compared for various \ncharacteristics. This method has the advantages of not having to ascertain the exact \npopulation of drivers, or their exposure, as crashes are used as the unit of analysis, and \nother crashes used an exposure proxy. Furthermore, the use of pairs of drivers from the \nsame crash means that many environmental variables of interest are held constant. A \nvariant of this method, which is called quasi-induced exposure (see 47-49), calculates \ncrash risk as a ratio of responsible drivers divided by the proportion of non-responsible in \neach group (defined by whatever variable is of interest, age for example), then the groups' \nrisk ratios can be compared. If these differ, it can be said that there is an effect of the \ngrouping variable.  \nThe common approach for the induced method is that you cannot get all relevant data for \nthe population, but instead compare the data of two groups. However, despite its \npopularity, this type of method does not seem to have been validated, and some results \nwould seem to indicate that induced and direct techniques can yield different results, even \nwhen the same data is used (9). Also, for the data in the present study, it has been shown \nthat the assignment of responsiblity is too lenient, with a substantial percent of bus \n 7  \ndrivers\u2019 being categorized as not at fault in accidents when they were probably active \nparticipants in the crash (57). Such erroneous coding may have serious repercussions for \nthe induced method, but probably very small effects if associations with predictors are \ncalculated directly for culpable accidents only. Therefore, it was decided to use both the \ndirect and indirect methods to study the effects of age and experience upon the accident \nrates of bus drivers, and compare results between these methods. \nTo summarize, this study aimed to investigate the role of age and bus driving experience \non crash risk when taking into account culpability, with special emphasis on the first year \nof employment with a bus company, using two different methods of analysing crash risk.  \n \n \n2. METHOD \n2.1 Data \n2.1.1 Source, coding and arrangement \nA major UK bus company supplied data for the present study. Information about all their \ncrashes and passenger falls was gathered and entered into an incident database. Some \ndriver characteristics, such as age and length of employment, were also available. A \nfurther advantage was that all incidents are reported and attributed to a particular driver, \nno matter how minor. This is due to a strictly adhered to company policy that all vehicles \nare checked at the start and end of each shift. Each crash is coded by the driver according \nto several different categories. Culpability was assigned by the depot manager and the \ninsurance team (for further details see the Appendix). In the present study, three levels of \nresponsibility were available; Partly, Solely and Not responsible. \n 8  \nThe data could be analysed taking the driver or crash as the unit of analysis. \nUnfortunately, the available sets for these two different types of analysis were not exactly \nthe same, mainly due to the practical problems of extracting data for such large datasets. \n \n2.1.2 Direct data \nSamples of drivers were drawn from five regions. Available for each driver was date of \nbirth, date of commencement of employment and number of crashes between 2001-2005 \n(the period for which this information was available) at the three different levels of \nculpability. However, only the culpable accidents were used (both categories of partly \nand solely responsible added together). Descriptive data for these are shown in Table 1. It \nshould be noted that both age and experience in the accident sample are lower using the \nindirect method compared with the direct sample (Table 1 and 2). . For the indirect \nsample, it can be seen that mean age does not differ between culpability levels, while \nexperience does. \n \nTables 1-2 about here \n \n2.1.3 Induced data \nThe bus company operates from 121 depots in the UK and the induced analysis included \nall crashes that occurred throughout these depots from December 2000 to June 2003\n1\n, \nexcept passenger falls and those where details about the crash and culpability were not \ncomplete (see Table 2). The accidents of 12,244 bus drivers aged between 18 \u2013 64 years \n 9  \nwho had been in service from one month to 35 years were analysed. Information about \ndriver\u2019s sex was not available, but, as can be seen from the direct data of sample 1 (Table \n1) almost all of these bus drivers are male.  \n \n2.1.4 Direct method calculations \nThe direct method uses the individual driver as the unit of analysis, computing the effects \nof age and experience on accident rate. Also, the drivers with little experience could be \nsingled out for further analysis. Furthermore, the trend over time in accident liability \ncould be tracked by dividing the sample into groups with differing experience and \ncalculating the mean number of accidents for each year between the groups using t-test \nanalyses.  \nThe results for different groups could also be compared with the risk ratios of the indirect \nmethod (see next section), for groups contructed according to the same principles (e.g. an \nage band). If results of the two methods were similar, this would mean that the known \nerror in coding for culpability was random for the two variables of interest here (age and \nexperience), because the direct method does not involve the Not responsible accidents \n(where the coding is partly erroneous, as shown in 57). \n \n2.1.5 Indirect\/induced method calculations \nIn the present paper, the drivers in accidents were not pairs from the same accident, as \nmost were car drivers and thus not really comparable to the population of interest. \nSimilarly, single-vehicle accidents were included, that are, of course assumed to be \n                                                                                                                                                 \n1\n The direct and indirect samples were thus not the same (although there must have been some overlap), due \nto organisational factors; the indirect sample was already compiled by the company, while the direct \n 10  \nculpable. Therefore, the present analyses violated one of the assumptions of quasi-\ninduced exposure, and thus introduced an unknown amount of error into the calculations. \nHowever, for a population of bus drivers, the use of pairs of drivers from the same \naccident are probably not that important, because the main purpose of this part of the \nmethod is to hold constant factors like time of day. Here car drivers probably differ a lot \nin their exposure compared with bus drivers (49). Risk exposure for bus drivers at work is \nmuch more standardized, as they have less choice concerning routes, time of day, type of \nvehicle etc than the car driving population. Therefore, it was not expected that there \nwould be any significant violation of the assumption of non-culpable drivers as a random \nsample of the population. However, the risk ratios computed here cannot be compared to \nthose of the quasi-induced method, as the numbers of drivers assigned to responsible and \nnot responsible categories are not necessarily equally distributed. A higher percentage of \ndrivers in the responsible category will therefore bias the risk ratios towards high values. \nConsequently, the analysis can only yield results that can be used for comparisons \nbetween groups (e.g. the ratio is lower for older drivers). It should be noted that the \nanalysis is based on collisions, so that drivers may appear in the data more than once if \nthey have been involved in multiple collisions within the time period.  \n \n2.2 Statistical methods \nTwo main problems for the present study was a need to find comparable statistics for the \ntwo different methods, and that the effects were not necessarily linear. Also, the two \npredictor variables were expected to be strongly correlated. \n                                                                                                                                                 \nsamples had to be manually extracted from the main database by a researcher at a later date. \n 11  \nAlthough not commonly used in accident research currently, the Pearson correlation and \nmultiple regression analyses were deemed suitable for the direct method, as most \nvariables were fairly normally distributed, with experience being the only exception. \nHere, there was a fairly strong positive skew, indicating that many drivers only stay in the \njob for a rather short period of time. Therefore, t-tests were used to compare different \ngroups of drivers, according to age and experience. \nFor the indirect sample, risk ratios were calculated between the culpable and non-\nculpable accidents, for groups formed with the same cut-off values for age and \nexperience as for the direct calculations. The result is a measure of differences in \naccident-causing tendencies between groups. A ratio of 1 means that a group of drivers \nare equally involved in responsible and non-responsible crashes. \nGiven that measures of risk for groups defined in the same way had been calculated for \nboth the direct and the indirect samples, these could be compared on a common scale, \nafter standardization of values. \n \n \n \n3. RESULTS \n3.1 Direct calculations \nAge and number of years of employment were correlated with the number of responsible \naccidents in a five-year period for all samples. As the associations were rather similar \nbetween samples, they were pooled into one. For this group, correlations for responsible \naccidents with age and experience are shown in Table 3. Thereafter, it was tested whether \n 12  \nexperience had any long-term effect by excluding accidents in the first year of driving for \nthe company. It was found that the correlation with accidents for the whole period (2001-\n2005) was significant for up to four years. With more than five years experience, at the \nbeginning of 2001, r was -.051 (N=1302, ns). As could be expected, the reverse exclusion \nprocess had the opposite effect; the correlation between accidents and experience was \nstrongest for the drivers with less than one year of service at the start of 2001. \nExperience was therefore further analysed by dividing the direct sample by years of \nexperience and calculating the mean number of responsible accidents for each available \ncalender year. The strongest effects were found for the first two years of driving (see \nFigure 1 and Table 4). Therefore, these were singled out and compared with the same \ngroups from the induced data set (Figures 2-3). \nAs age and experience correlated .366 (N=2153, p<.0001), multiple regressions were run \nwith these variables as predictors of responsible accidents. For the whole period (2001-\n2005), both were significant (p<.0001, beta for experience -.150,  age .106, R=.152, \nN=2153). Results for each year in isolation were very similar. It is worth noting here that \nthe age trend was positive. \nHowever, dividing the sample into different age groups and comparing their means \nrevealed that there was actually a higher risk for drivers under 25 years of age (see Figure \n4), a negative initial trend. As this group was very small (N=24), this difference was only \nsignificant at p<.05 in comparison with the three next groupings, while against all other \ndrivers it was not significant.  \n \n \n 13  \nTable 3 and Figure 1 about here \n \n \n3.3 Indirect calculations: Risk ratios \n3.3.1 Total time period \nRisk ratios were first computed for every year of experience. There was a marked decline \nduring the first two years of driving (for both culpability categories), which were \nsignificantly different from later years, using a chi2 test (see Table 5). The later \ndifferences were not significant, due to dwindling Ns with the longer time periods. This \nwould seem to pinpoint the effect of experience within the first years or so. Therefore, \nresults are shown for the first five years, and compared to the findings of the direct \nmethod for drivers with less than one year\u2019s experience at the beginning of 2001 (Figure \n2). This could also be calculated for up to six years, when the first year is deleted (this \ncomparison uses the drivers with more than one but less than 2 year\u2019s experience).  \n \nFigure 3 and Table 5 about here \n \n \n \n \n3.3.3 Comparisons of direct and indirect results \n 14  \nFigures 2 and 3 show the results for experience from the direct and indirect samples, with \ndifferent starting points. It can be seen that for the first comparison (one to five years of \nexperience), the results were very similar, while for the second, they were less similar.  \nThereafter, the risk ratios computed for age groups (responsible accidents divided by not \nresponsible for each age group) can also be seen in Figures 4 and 5, and Table 6. The \ntrends in these sets of data would seem to be fairly similar, with a correlation of .800 \n(N=9, p<.05). \n \nFigures 2-5  and Table 6 about here \n \n \n4. DISCUSSION \nThe main findings of this study indicate that, overall, there was an initial negative, and \nthereafter a weak positive effect of age on bus driver accidents, and a somewhat stronger \ninitial, negative effect of experience, for both calculation methods. It therefore appears \nthat lack of experience of driving a bus is more influential than age in its contribution to \nrisk for crashes at first, but that age after a few years is still influential although rather \nweak, while experience no longer contributes to the change in crash risk. \nIt can also be concluded that the induced method does seem to yield similar results to the \ndirect calculations, despite the violations against the assumptions of the original method \n(e.g. violation of the driver pair assumption). The method used to compare risk ratios and \ndirect calculations of means for similarly constructed groups would seem to be a new \ncontribution to the debate. It is therefore important to point out what can actually be \n 15  \nconcluded from these standardized values. As the basic values are in different units, the \nsize of the two values for example, the first year of experience, cannot be directly \ncompared with each other. However, they can both be compared to the other values \nwithin the same variable, and it can therefore be concluded that both methods indicate \nthat the risk is twice as high in the first year of driving as in the second year of driving. \nThere are a number of methodological limitations to the present study that need to be \nconsidered. Firstly it is reasonable to assume that many of the employees with greater \ncrash involvement will tend to leave the company (56), although no such effect could be \nfound for Swedish bus drivers by af W\u00e5hlberg (9). If this situation were the case, for the \npresent bus company, this would lead to over-estimations of the effects, especially for \nexperience, in the indirect data, while the direct sample would probably under-estimate \nthem instead. However, the differences between methods were small, so there does not \nseem to be a case for suspecting an attrition effect. \nSecondly, assigning culpability was jointly undertaken by depot managers and the \ninsurance company (see Appendix). As there are a large number of depots from which the \ndata was gathered, a large degree of error variance is to be expected from this source. As \nno inter-rater reliability assessments were undertaken, this facet remains an unknown. \nThirdly, it is possible that new drivers may be allocated less favourable routes and shifts \ncompared with their longer serving peers, making their exposure qualitatively worse. \nHowever, the policy for bus company is the opposite to this. Depot managers are \nencouraged to ensure that in the early weeks of driving for the company, new drivers are \ngiven \u2018nursery routes\u2019. Therefore, the estimates of the impact of experience on accidents \ncalculated here are, if anything, underestimations. \n 16  \nFourthly, it is estimated by the bus company that about a third of the new drivers actually \nhave some experience from other companies when they are hired. The experience effects \nfound here are therefore underestimates of the actual ones. \nThe induced exposure technique assumes that non-culpable accidents are directly related \nto exposure and can be used as a proxy for it. As has been shown for the present data, this \nis not always the case (57). Also, Sagberg (51) added mileage and age as further \npredictors in his calculations using this method, with considerable effects (52). \nInexperience in the form of lack of knowledge about hazards and the appropriate vehicle \nhandling skills to allow the driver to manoeuvre safely may result in the driver taking \nunnecessary risks in unknown situations (53-55). At present, the average newly recruited \ntrainee bus driver with the present bus company receives about two weeks instruction on \nvehicle handling skills training and hazard awareness in one of the company\u2019s driving \nschools, in common with many other professional driver training courses. Apart from a \ntest of the two methods of analysing crash risk and finding that there is little to chose \nbetween them when considering professional driver accidents, the implications of the \npresent data suggests that the most fruitful targets for training of bus drivers would be to \nfocus on novice drivers, regardless of age. There is also the suggestion that older drivers \nmay need a refresher driver training course to mitigate risk.  \n 17  \n \nREFERENCES \n1. Johnson, H. M., 1946.

Journal of Safety Research 38, 453-459.\n 24  \n \nAppendix \nAssignment of culpability by the Bus Company \n \nAfter a collision, the bus driver completes a report with 6 boxes to tick for road type \ncategories and 7 boxes to describe the road features where the collision took place. The \ndriver can only tick one of these boxes for each of the sections and they are given no \nguidance about the circumstances under which they must respond to different boxes. \nThere is no miscellaneous box. The accident report must also contain a diagram to \ndescribe what happened. \n \nThis report is forwarded to the depot manager who completes an 'Opinion Memo'. The \nmanager looks at the driver's report, considers local knowledge and looks at the diagram. \nHe\/She then sends the Opinion memo to an in-house insurance team. They gather all the \nevidence, which includes the driver's report, the memo, witness reports, police reports, \nphotographs (if available - drivers all have a disposable camera in the cab). The insurance \nteam then either agree or disagree with the opinion memo. Culpability is assigned at this \npoint and the information loaded on to the database. There are about 40 - 60,000 records \neach year. \n \n 25  \n \n \n \n \nTable 1: Descriptive data for the driver samples in the direct analysis.

After several post-doctoral positions, Lisa was appointed as Director of \nthe Driving Research Group at Cranfield University in 2001. Her research interests are \ndriver training and the use of psychometrics for predicting driver behaviour and \naccidents. \n \nAnders af W\u00e5hlberg graduated with a B. A. in history (1994) and  an M. A. in psychology \n(1996) from Uppsala University, and thereafter worked as a research assistant at the \nCenter for Risk Research, Stockholm School of Economics 1996-1998. He thereafter \npursued a PhD in psychology (2006) at the Department of Psychology, Uppsala \nUniversity, Sweden. His main research interests are driver behavior, traffic accidents, and \nmethodology, most often combined. \n"}
