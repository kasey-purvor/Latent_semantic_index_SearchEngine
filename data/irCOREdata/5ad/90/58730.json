As part of a re-investigation of the FEH \nmethodology in a reservoir safety context (Stewart et al. 2009), it was therefore \nconsidered necessary to review the literature regarding other methods.  \n \nIn Great Britain, reservoirs are classified into four categories depending on the \npotential risk to communities downstream in the event of a dam failure (ICE 1996). \nThe reservoir design flood inflow for the highest category, Category A, is the \nprobable maximum flood (PMF), with the lower categories B-D having design flow \nreturn periods between 10,000 and 150 years. It is these types of return periods that \nare the main focus of the review, although not all countries provide estimates of such \nhigh return periods. When river flow records are not available, or in addition to direct \nflood frequency estimation, flows can be estimated from rainfall records using a \nhydrological model. The latter approach results in an entire flow hydrograph which is \nrequired, for example, for reservoir design. A simple design rainfall may consist of an \nestimate of the total event rainfall and an associated temporal distribution, assuming a \nspatially uniform distribution over the catchment. The areal rainfall amount is related \nto the point rainfall amount via a so-called areal reduction factor (for a review of these \nsee Svensson and Jones (2010)).  \n \nThe rainfall return periods used for reservoir design require extrapolation of the \nquantile function well beyond the length of the observed individual rain gauge \nrecords. Methods to gain information for carrying out such extrapolation include  \n \n1) meteorological guidance \n2) statistical extreme value theory \n3) increasing the amount of data used for analysis: \na. using more events per year than the annual maxima approach \nb. spatial data pooling \n \nThe first of these methods mainly concerns the estimation of probable maximum \nprecipitation (PMP), whereas the last two are the bases for the methods described in \nthis review. The extrapolation is not trivial. Vit Kleme\u0161 has outlined the problems \nassociated with estimating the probabilities of extreme hydrological events in a \nnumber of papers (e.g. Kleme\u0161 1986, 1988, 1989, 1993). His main point was that the \nhydrological information content of the data has been neglected in the pursuit of high \nmathematical rigour in the fitting of probability distribution models to the observed \nevents. Among other things, he noted that extremes occur more due to unusual \ncombinations of the physical factors contributing to the rainfall than to unusual \nmagnitudes of the factors themselves, and therefore advocated a joint probability \napproach based on the same components as used for some PMP assessments (Kleme\u0161 \n1993). In this way, the quantile estimate of each contributing factor does not require \nextrapolation, while the combination of the factors results in a rainfall of low \n 3 \nprobability. Eagleson (1972) outlined a similar approach for flood estimation, and \njoint probability methodologies for hydrological applications are being explored in \nseveral countries (e.g. Arnaud and Lavabre 2002, Rahman et al. 2002, Kjeldsen et al. \n2010). Unless there are strong reasons to adopt a simple model (such as statistical \nindependence), a joint probability methodology, because of the difficulties of \nmodelling and estimating this dependence based on limited data,  may not actually be \nan improvement over simpler methods. \n \nBelow, methods for point rainfall frequency estimation used nationwide in nine \ndifferent countries are described country by country. The FSR and FEH methods are \ndescribed in some detail, particularly in relation to issues where they have come in for \nsome criticism. The review ends with a summary table of the methods and a \ndiscussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches used. \n \n \nCanada \n \nEnvironment Canada is the only source of Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) \ninformation on a national scale for Canada, although many universities, provinces, \nmunicipalities and other agencies do similar research for their own applications \n(Robert Morris, Environment Canada, personal communication, August 2009). Up-to-\ndate IDF tables and graphs are available for 549 individual locations across Canada, \ndownloadable from Environment Canada\u2019s webpage (EC 2010). As well as the IDF \ninformation, 50% confidence limits around the rainfall estimates are provided for a \nselection of return periods (2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years) and durations (5, 10, 15, 30 \nminutes, and 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours).  \n \nDerivation of the frequency curves, described by Hogg et al. (1989), is the same as for \nthe earlier Rainfall Frequency Atlas for Canada (Hogg and Carr 1985). Whereas the \nup-to-date IDF information on the webpage involves users making their own spatial \ninterpolation, this atlas contains maps of parameters for calculating estimates of \nrainfall at a particular return period for any location in Canada. Maps are available for \nrainfall durations between 5 minutes and 24 hours, making the estimates suitable for \nsmall or urban catchments. Estimates for longer durations are available on request.  \n \nThe parameters used for the frequency estimation are the mean, \u03bc, and standard \ndeviation,\uf073 , of the annual maximum (AM) rainfall series, estimated using the \nmethod of moments. A rainfall estimate for a given return period is derived from a \nfrequency-factor formulation of the Gumbel distribution, which involves these two \nparameters. \n \nHogg and Carr (1985) give maps of isolines of the mean and the standard deviation, \nand the user interpolates between these to obtain values for the location of interest. \nLogarithmic interpolation of estimates is recommended to obtain rainfall estimates for \nintermediate durations. An adjustment upwards is made to rainfall estimates in \nmountainous areas, with different factors for onshore coastal and non-coastal \nmountains. The adjustment factors increase with increasing duration. Precipitation \nextremes during the cold season (rainfall plus snowmelt) are dealt with separately. \n \n 4 \nThe values of mean and standard deviation can also be used to get a gross estimate of \nPMP. According to Hershfield (1977), PMP can be estimated using a version of this \napproach in which the frequency-factor changes with the mean and duration. These \nrelationships were constructed by combining information from multiple gauges across \nseveral countries. Hogg and Carr (1985) quote these equations for durations of 1, 6 \nand 24 hours and note that such PMP estimates have been exceeded on several \noccasions. \n \n \nSweden \n \nHigh-hazard dams in Sweden are designed using a deterministic approach, similar to \nthe PMF procedure, with emphasis on critical timing of flood-generating factors. They \nare, however, not based on PMP estimates, but on observed maximum areal \nprecipitation in combination with extreme snowmelt simulations: a trial and error \nprocedure finds the worst flood for a specific river system. A nationwide study was \nundertaken of 24-h (2-day before 1926) 1,000 km\n2\n and 10,000 km\n2\n areal precipitation \namounts exceeding 90 mm and\/or 70 mm, respectively, during the period 1881-1988. \nThese 70 events formed the basis of five 14-day time-sequences of rainfall, \nappropriate for larger rivers. Each sequence is specific to one of five climatological \nregions, and was developed so that it roughly contains the largest observed amounts \nover 24 hours to 14 days duration. The precipitation sequences were arranged to \ngenerate the most critical flood development, which led to the largest 24-h value \nbeing located on day 9 of the sequence. Each precipitation sequence is corrected for \nseason, catchment area and elevation before being entered into a hydrological model \n(Norstedt et al. 1992). The regionalisation is based on the magnitude of the extreme \nareal precipitation events (Fl\u00f6deskommitt\u00e9n 1990). Alexandersson et al. (2001) report \nthat the areal precipitation database is updated regularly.  \n \nVedin and Eriksson (1988) give a rough empirical estimate of the return period, Tareal, \nof the largest observed areal precipitation value in each homogeneous region as  \n \nionprecipitatofarea\nregionofarea\nNTareal \uf0d7\uf03d  ,       (1) \n \nwhere the study period is N years. \n \nTaking into account the design values of rainfall used above, soil moisture deficits \nand snowmelt, Bergstr\u00f6m et al. (1989) report that the resulting floods are expected to \nexceed a return period of 10,000 years.  \n \nA reinvestigation of the method (Bergstr\u00f6m et al. 2008) concluded that most of the \nconditions prescribed in the guidelines have been relatively stable over the period that \nhas elapsed since they were adopted. However, the frequency of occurrence of \nobserved extreme areal rainfall events has increased, although there is at present no \ncorresponding increase in observed runoff. Dahlstr\u00f6m (2006) argues that, although \nquantitative information from climate simulations and trend analyses are uncertain, it \nmay still be preferable to correct the design guidelines for potential increases to \nextreme rainfalls.  \n \n 5 \nOf probabilistic rather than deterministic methods, the station-year method for rainfall \nfrequency analysis has been applied to an area straddling the border between Norway \nand Sweden (Alexandersson et al. 2001). When applying this method, all the data in a \nregion are pooled into one long series, and analysed as if it were a single long record. \nRainfall observations are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (e.g. \nBuishand, 1984). In this case, the combined dataset comprises about 2,300 station-\nyears derived from the AM precipitation series at each site, based on daily \nobservations in the period 1961-2000. The region is considered homogeneous with \nrespect to large daily rainfalls. Return periods were estimated both empirically and by \nfitting probability distributions. For example, there are six values greater than 100 \nmm, and the empirical return period is therefore estimated to be 2,300\/6= 380 years. \nThe empirical return periods agree reasonably well with those estimated from a \nGeneralised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution using probability-weighted moments \n(PWMs). The Gumbel distribution does not fit the upper tail of the data, either when \nfitted using the method of (product) moments, or when fitted using a regression on \nplotting positions. This lack of fit suggests that a three-parameter probability \ndistribution like the GEV may be more appropriate.  \n \nFor point precipitation of moderate return periods it is more common to fit GEV and \nGumbel distributions to individual series rather than using the station-year approach \n(Lennart Wern, SMHI, personal communication, August 2009). If the time series of \ndata is relatively short, the preferred method is to fit a GEV using an average of the \nshape parameter across nearby series. GEV and Gumbel fits are plotted for single \nsites, and subjective common sense is used when deciding which fit to use. Wherever \npossible, data from nearby stations are used, and it is noted that long series are needed \nto obtain a realistic fit of the GEV to individual series. \n \nPrecipitation estimates for sub-daily durations with return periods up to 10 years can \nbe obtained through an equation using monthly mean precipitation for May, July and \nAugust as input (Dahlstr\u00f6m 1979, summarised by Dahlstr\u00f6m 2006).   \n \n \nFrance \n \nM\u00e9t\u00e9o-France supplies rainfall estimates for return periods up to 100 years, for \ndurations from 6 minutes to 10 days (M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France 2007; M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France 2010). Both \nAM and peak-over-threshold (POT) methods are used to estimate the frequency of \nshort duration rainfalls. GEV distributions are used for the AM series, fitted using \nPWMs. The shape parameter k is generally negative for rainfall durations between 1 \nand 24 hours, suggesting that a Gumbel distribution is not applicable. The so-called \n\u201crenewal method\u201d is a type of POT method, developed to be particularly suitable for \nshort series (at least 10 years long). Starting using a low threshold yielding more than \none independent event per year on average, a Generalised Pareto distribution is fitted \nto the peaks. Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions are fitted to the series of \nnumber of peaks in each year. The goodness-of-fit is assessed using \u03c72-tests for the \ndistributions of exceedances and counts, and the significance levels are retained. The \nthreshold is then successively increased, and new goodness-of-fit tests carried out, \nuntil there is only one value per year on average. The parameters of the sample that \nhas the best fit are adopted for use if the significance level is better than 5%.  \n \n 6 \nFor high return periods, the GRADEX method (FRCOLD 1994) is used. It is a \nmethod for flood frequency estimation used for design of reservoirs, and includes \nanalysis of rainfall data. Annual precipitation extremes (either point or areal values) \nare estimated for return periods between 10 and 10,000 years using the Gumbel \ndistribution. The method gets its name from the \u201cgradex\u201d, the parameter a, which is \nthe slope of the frequency curve (a straight line) when plotted on the Gumbel scale. \nRainfall estimates are obtained through a seasonal analysis. Firstly, for homogeneous \nseasons (weather-wise), the distribution function FS(P) of extreme precipitation is \nobtained from the frequency distribution F(P) of all (zero and non-zero) time-unit \nprecipitations historically recorded in that season, as FS(P) = [F(P)]\nm\n, where m is the \nnumber of time-units in the season. This is justified by the poor autocorrelation \nbetween successive storms of more than 4 hours duration. Secondly, the distribution \nfunctions for the seasonal rainfall maxima can be multiplied to obtain the distribution \nfunction for the AM rainfalls. The requirement stated for this method is a few dozen \nof years of record. Because daily data are more abundant than sub-daily records, \nKieffer and Bois (1997) investigated relating the gradex of 24-h rainfalls with \nobservations of shorter duration. They conclude that a relationship can be established \nwith 6-h and 12-h rainfalls, but not for shorter durations. \n \n \nGermany \n \nDesign rainfalls in Germany are derived using three different methods depending on \nthe target return period (DWD 2005). For 0.5 to 100 years return period, the \nKOSTRA method is used to estimate heavy precipitation (Bartels et al. 1997). The \ncontribution from snowmelt is also considered, separately. At the top end of the return \nperiod scale, PMP is estimated, and in between the lower and upper ends an \nextrapolation of the KOSTRA method is used. The account below is based on Bartels \net al. (1997) and personal communication with Gabriele Malitz at Deutscher \nWetterdienst (July 2009).  \n \nThe KOSTRA method estimates design rainfalls for durations between 5 minutes and \n72 hours. The results are presented on a grid covering Germany, at a resolution of \n8.45 km. The gridded values are based on 5 minute resolution measurements for about \n200 stations (records around 30 years long) and daily values at about 4500 stations \n(records often 60 years long). Precipitation is estimated separately for summer, winter \nand annually.  \n \nBoth AM and POT series are used for the statistical analysis. Gumbel distributions are \nfitted to AM series and exponential distributions to POT series. The distributions are \nfitted by assigning plotting positions, T, (different for the two different distributions) \nto the observations and then fitting a regression line to the rainfall depth versus ln T. \nThe regression equation, in the case that an exponential distribution is fitted, is \n \nh(D, T) = u(D) + w(D) ln T,         (2) \n \nwhere h is the precipitation depth, D is the duration, T is the return period, and u and \nw are distribution parameters. For reasonably large return periods, this is an \napproximation to the Gumbel distribution.  \n \n 7 \nA regionalisation method is used to obtain precipitation estimates on the 8.45 km grid. \nIn winter, precipitation events are predominantly advective, meaning that short- and \nlong-duration precipitation amounts are more strongly related than in other seasons. \nHence, the dense daily rain gauge network can provide information about sub-daily \nprecipitation characteristics. The spatial dependence is also stronger in winter than in \nsummer, making a distance-only spatial interpolation viable. In summer, heavy short-\nduration precipitation (\u226460 minutes) is mainly of small-scale convective origin, and \ndoes not show a good relationship with the precipitation characteristics for longer \ndurations. However, there is a good relationship with orography, and the gradient and \norientation of the slope of the terrain to the prevailing weather system are taken into \naccount for the spatial interpolation. To obtain realistic precipitation amounts for all \ndurations, the parameters u(D) and w(D) are smoothed across the durations.  \n \nKOSTRA precipitation estimates up to 100 years return period have been applied in \nthe design of channel networks and water retention basins. For reservoir safety \napplications, with return periods above 100 years, the KOSTRA rainfalls are \nestimated using an extrapolation of the KOSTRA regression line, but using a steeper \nslope.  \n \n \nUnited States \n \nThe Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center (HDSC) within the Office of \nHydrologic Development of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s \n(NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) is updating precipitation frequency \nestimates for various parts of the United States and affiliated territories (e.g. Perica et \nal. 2009).  Updated precipitation frequency estimates for durations from 5 minutes to \n60 days and selected return periods (1-year to 1,000-years) accompanied by additional \ninformation (e.g., 90% confidence intervals, temporal distributions, seasonality) are \npublished in NOAA Atlas 14 (NOAA 2010).   \n \n \nThe index-flood approach \n \nPrecipitation frequency estimates are based on the analysis of AM series using an \nindex-flood approach (e.g. Stedinger et al. 1993). The distribution of floods (or \nrainfall) at different sites in a region are assumed to be the same except for a scaling \nfactor, the index. The problem is reduced to estimating the index for a site, and a \nstandardised regional growth curve (the ratio of the quantiles to the index). Rainfall \nestimates at any site are then obtained by multiplying the site index value with the \nregionally derived growth curve.  \n \n \nThe index variable \n \nThe index variable in this case is the mean AM rainfall. The means for each station \nand duration were spatially interpolated using PRISM technology (Daly et al. 1997; \n2002) to produce index grids. For the Hawaian Islands (Perica et al. 2009), the spatial \nresolution is 15 arc seconds (about 400 m), but recent work include resolutions down \nto 2.5 arc seconds (Sanja Perica, HDSC, personal communication, October 2009). \n 8 \n \n \nThe growth curve \n \nFollowing Hosking and Wallis (1997), the growth curve is estimated using L-\nmoments. AM based frequency estimates are converted to POT based estimates using \nan empirical formula. This is useful for shorter return periods where these estimates \ndiffer.   \n \nThe regionalisation involved an initial division into potential (fixed boundary) regions \nusing cluster analysis based on topography and climatology of extreme events. \nHomogeneity and discordancy tests were carried out and necessary adjustments made \nto obtain the final regions. A variety of probability distributions (including GEV, \nGeneralised Normal, Generalised Pareto, Generalised Logistic, Pearson Type 3, \nKappa and Wakeby) were examined and the most appropriate distribution for each \nregion and duration was selected using several different performance measures. The \nfinal determination of the appropriate distributions for each region and duration was \nmade based on sensitivity tests and a desire for a relatively smooth transition between \ndistributions from region to region.  \n \nQuantiles were determined based on the site index and the regionally determined L-\nmoments (weighted according to record length) of the selected probability \ndistribution. Constant second and higher order moments within each region could \nresult in the potential for discontinuities in the quantile estimates at regional \nboundaries. A spatial interpolation technique termed the Cascade, Residual Add-Back \n(e.g., Perica et al. 2009) that accommodates spatial smoothing and interpolation \nacross regional boundaries was used to produce grids of precipitation estimates for \nvarious frequencies and durations. Monte Carlo simulation was used to provide 90% \nconfidence intervals. \n \n \nSouth Africa \n \nThe South African method for design rainfall estimation covers return periods \nbetween 2 and 200 years, and durations from 5 minutes to 7 days. It is referred to as \nRLMA&SI, the Regional L-Moment Algorithm in conjunction with a Scale \nInvariance approach (Smithers and Schulze 2003; 2004). This is a regional frequency \nanalysis method. Similar to the method used in the United States, it is based on \nHosking and Wallis (1997) and uses L-moments and homogeneous regions for an \nindex-flood approach. Rainfall estimates are available on a grid that covers the \ncountry with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute.  \n \n \nThe index variable \n \nThe index variable is the mean AM rainfall. The means can be estimated for any \nlocation using multiple linear regression relationships with site characteristics (mean \nannual precipitation, latitude and altitude). The exact formulation of the regression \nequations differ (i.e. selection of variables and fitted coefficients) for each \nhomogeneous region. Different regions were used for different durations; seven \n 9 \nregions for durations of 1 day or more, and 15 regions for durations of 24 hours or \nless. The regions were derived using cluster analysis of site characteristics (latitude, \nlongitude, altitude, a monthly index of precipitation concentration, mean annual \nprecipitation, a seasonality index and distance from the sea). By clustering according \nto site characteristics rather than on the rainfall statistics directly, the heterogeneity of \neach region can subsequently be assessed by comparing the between-site variability of \nL-moments with that which would be expected for a homogeneous region. The \nregions have fixed boundaries in the sense that the member stations in each region do \nnot change with the target location for the frequency analysis, as in the methods used \nin e.g. New Zealand, Australia and the UK. \n \nStrong linear relationships occur within each region when plotting each station\u2019s mean \n1-day AM rainfall versus the same station\u2019s mean AM of a duration greater than 1 \nday. Similarly, the mean for durations <24h scale nearly linearly as a function of the \n24-h values (the moving-window 24-h value is related to the fixed 1-day value at the \nsite). The slope and intercept of these regression lines were found to scale by a power \nlaw relationship with duration. However, there were sometimes changes in the \nscaling, typically occurring at certain \u201cpivotal\u201d durations: 15 minutes, 2 hours, 1 day \nand 3 days. At ungauged sites, the means of the AM series were therefore estimated \nfor the pivotal durations using regression on site characteristics, and those for \nintermediate durations were calculated from these values using the scaling \nrelationships. Sub-daily estimates are thought to have been improved by the use of \nscaling based on daily observations. The daily records used are both longer and more \nabundant (1789 stations with at least 40 years of record) than sub-daily records (172 \nstations with at least 10 years of record). \n \n \nThe growth curve \n \nThe GEV distribution was deemed the most suitable for rainfall in South Africa. \nGrowth curves were derived separately for each homogeneous region, using \nregionally averaged L-moment ratios, weighted in proportion to the sites\u2019 record \nlengths. The 1-day L-moment ratios generally fell within the 90% confidence \nintervals computed for other durations (from 30 minutes to 7 days) using a \nbootstrapping technique. Two other techniques also gave similar results. It was \ntherefore concluded that design rainfall estimates for all durations may be estimated \nas the product of the 1-day growth curve and an estimate of the mean of the AM series \nfor the duration in question. The preference for using the 1-day growth curve, rather \nthan growth curves derived for each duration, is again based on the perceived greater \nreliability of the daily rainfall records than of records of other durations (particularly \nsub-daily records). For details of issues with the short-duration data, see Smithers and \nSchulze (2000). \n \n \nNew Zealand \n \nThe National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) maintains the \nnational climate database for New Zealand, and NIWA\u2019s National Climate Centre \n(NIWA 2010) carries out climate mapping and analysis of high intensity rainfalls. \nDesign rainfalls are estimated using the High Intensity Rainfall Design System \n 10 \n(HIRDS) software (Thompson 1992). It was first developed in 1992, based on an \nestablished method for rainfall frequency estimation. It has been updated more \nrecently regarding the regionalisation techniques used, and to include more up-to-date \ndata (Thompson 2002). The HIRDS method uses an index-flood procedure to provide \nrainfall estimates of durations from 10 minutes to 72 hours, and return periods from 2 \nto 150 years. \n \n \nThe index variable \n \nThe index rainfall was taken to be the median AM rainfall. The sample median is used \nin preference to the mean, or some other location parameter, since it is not usually \naffected by the presence of outliers. The median rainfall was mapped by fitting thin-\nplate smoothing splines as implemented by ANUSPLIN (Hutchinson 1995; 2000). \nThe spline is a surface that is fitted to spatially distributed data with some error \nassumed at each data point, so that the surface can be smoother than if the data fitted \nexactly. Longitude, latitude and altitude above sea level were taken into account when \nfitting the spline. This trivariate spline of rainfall allows for a continuous spatially \nvarying dependence on elevation, and is well suited to applications over complex \nterrain as is found in New Zealand. It can also be a robust method for moderately \nsparse data networks. \n \n \nThe growth curve \n \nA \u201cregion of influence\u201d approach (Burn 1990) is used to obtain a regional growth \ncurve, rather than treating all of New Zealand as a single region. This means that a \nseparate region is defined for each site of interest, thus avoiding boundary problems \nassociated with fixed regions. Each site is assumed to be surrounded by stations \nhaving similar statistical attributes to the site of interest. The region of influence was \nselected isotropically, to include all stations within a 60 km radius. The limit is a \ncompromise between the possibility of selecting stations from a different rainfall \nclimate and the inclusion of too few stations to obtain a reliable estimate.  \n \nThe GEV distribution is used to derive the growth curves. The parameters for the \nregional GEV are estimated through the method of regionally averaged standardised \nPWMs (Hosking et al. 1985; Cunane 1989), using weights in proportion to the record \nlengths.  \n \nFor large parts of New Zealand the regional shape parameter k is negative. There is a \ngeneral increase in k with increasing duration, with the GEV being close to a Gumbel \ndistribution (i.e. k = 0) for durations of 6 hours and longer. \n \nThe AM series at a site was used if each annual value came from a year with at least \n11 months of data, and if there were at least 10 years of record (5 years for the \nestimation of the median rainfall in mountainous areas).  \n \nA new version of HIRDS should be available shortly (Graeme Horrell, NIWA, \npersonal communication, May 2010). It will use the same underlying procedures, but \n 11 \nwill be based on a few more years of data. In addition, it will include an assessment \nmodule for climate change. \n \n \nAustralia \n \nIn Australia, design rainfalls are derived in three different ways depending on their \nseverity (Weinmann et al. 1999). At the extreme end, design floods for dam design \nare based on estimates of PMP, whereas at the lower end rainfall amounts are \nestimated using frequency analysis. The remaining gap in the frequency curve is filled \nby a pragmatic interpolation procedure. The methods for rainfall frequency estimation \nhave recently been revised to extend the range of return periods for which the method \nis applicable. The new CRC-FORGE (Cooperative Research Centre \u2013 FOcussed \nRainfall Growth Estimation) methodology is considered suitable for return periods \nfrom 50 up to 2000 years, and was developed using daily data (1-5 days). Procedures \nfor estimating rainfalls down to 6 hours duration are available. CRC-FORGE is based \non the FORGE method, which was developed at the Institute of Hydrology in the UK \n(Reed and Stewart 1989).  \n \n \nThe index variable \n \nThe CRC-FORGE method (Weinmann et al., 1999) is an index-flood method where \nthe index variable is the 50-year return period rainfall from a fitted Log-Pearson \nType 3 distribution. This choice is based on a desire to make the higher return period \nrainfall estimates seamlessly continuous with the estimates previously obtained from \nthe Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR 1987; reprinted 2001) method. This earlier \nmethod has its upper limit at the 1 in 100-year rainfall and is still the design practice \nfor return periods up to 50 years, providing estimates for durations between 5 minutes \nand 72 hours. Weinmann et al. (1999) note that there is a strong and complex spatial \nvariation in the index variable, making spatial interpolation difficult and subject to \nconsiderable error. Altitude explains part of the local variation, but other \nhydrometeorological factors are also involved. \n \n \nSearch region \n \nSimilarly to the HIRDS method used in New Zealand, the CRC-FORGE method uses \na circular search area around the site of interest to define the region used for deriving \nthe regional growth curve for the site. However, the circular regions expand around \nthe site of interest (Figure 1), with each progressively larger region used to estimate \nsections of the growth curve corresponding to greater and greater return periods. The \npart of the growth curve corresponding to the smallest return periods is derived using \nonly the rainfall data at the site of interest. The sizes of the circles are determined so \nthat successive regions contain 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 192 stations. Only the six \nhighest ranking observations in each region are used to define the corresponding \ngrowth curve segment.  \n \n \n \n 12 \n \n \nFigure 1. Expanding circular regions and corresponding frequency curve \nsegments for different annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) (from \nWeinmann et al. (1999). This Figure was first published by The \nInstitution of Engineers, Australia. It is reprinted here with \npermission). \n \n \nFitting the growth curve \n \nA variant of the station-year method is used for estimating the growth curve: all the \nstandardised AM for the stations in the region are pooled into one long series. \nStandardisation is achieved by division by the site\u2019s index variable. A large sample is \nthus created, making up for the limited record length. A spatial dependence model is \napplied to account for the reduction in useful information resulting from inter-site \ndependence in the pooled data. The six highest ranking standardised observations \nfrom each region are assigned return periods T using the Gringorten plotting \npositions: \n \n1\/T = \n12.0\n44.0\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\neL\nm\n ,        (3) \n      \n \nwhere m is the rank of the observation, and Le is the effective record length estimated \nusing the dependence model (see next section). A GEV distribution is then fitted to \nthe data points using a least squares fitting method (Nandakumar et al. 1997). \n \n \nThe station-year method and the dependence model \n \nThe traditional station-year method for regional frequency analysis involves pooling \nall the data into one long data series, and proceding under the assumption that the \nobservations at the stations are independent of each other. An extreme value \ndistribution can then be fitted to this one long series of length L = N n , where N is the \nnumber of stations in the region and n  is their average record length. However, \n 13 \nrainfall data from sites within a region generally exhibit some degree of inter-station \ndependence (or spatial correlation). The effective size of the regional sample is thus \nLe = Ne\u00d7 n  \u2264 L, where Ne represents the effective number of independent gauging \nstations in the region. In CRC-FORGE the estimate of Ne for each region is assessed \nby fitting a spatial dependence model to the data (Weinmann et al. 1999; Nandakumar \net al. 2000).  \n \nThe relative information content of a regional data set of N stations can be expressed \nby the ratio lnNe\/lnN. This ratio varies with the degree of correlation, \uf072 , between the \nrainfall observed at different sites in the region, from 1 for independent data ( \uf072  = 0, \nNe = N) to a value of 0 for fully dependent data ( \uf072  = 1, Ne = 1). Simulation studies \nusing long series of generated rainfall data indicated that the ratio of lnNe\/lnN is not \nconstant over the range of return periods, but tends to increase with increasing return \nperiod, approaching the value of 1 for very high return periods. This is in accordance \nwith the intuitive expectation that the largest AM rainfall observations in a region are \nless dependent than more frequent events. Therefore a dependence model that varies \nwith return period was used: \n \n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec \uf02b\uf0a3\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\notherwise,,1\n,)lnln(for,])ln(ln[1\nln\nln\n2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b2\u03b3\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1 NyNy\nN\nNe\n   (4)\n \n \nwhere y, the Gumbel reduced variate, is an expression of the return period. The model \nparameters \uf067\uf062\uf061 and, depend on the rainfall duration D, and are fitted to the rainfall \ndata from an overall homogeneous region (i.e. not the circular search region), and \n\uf072  is the mean correlation of the observed AM rainfall series at all pairs of stations in \nthe region.  \n \n \nHomogeneous regions for the spatial dependence model \n \nFor the purpose of the dependence model, large areas that cannot be considered \nstatistically homogeneous are separated into different regions. For example, Western \nAustralia is divided into several regions based on meteorological and physical \ndistinctions (Durrant and Bowman 2004). The regions were the same for all rainfall \ndurations, but a seasonal analysis was also carried out and different regions were used \nfor summer and winter. Thus, the regions used for the derivation of the dependence \nmodels have fixed boundaries. However, the procedure for determining the growth \ncurve includes stations from adjoining regions to reduce any discontinuity across the \nregion boundaries. \n \n \nInterpolation between frequency estimates and PMP \n \nA generalised procedure to fill the \u201cgap\u201d in the frequency curve, between the 2000 \nyear return period rainfall and the PMP estimate, was developed by Siriwardena and \nWeinmann (1998) on the basis of work by Lowing and Law (1995) for floods in the \nUK. A 2-parameter parabolic function is fitted in log-log space to satisfy requirements \nat either end of the curve. The slope of the curve is not constrained in approaching the \n 14 \nPMP. The PMP is assigned a return period of between 10,000 and 10,000,000 years, \ndepending on the size of the catchment.  \n \nThe frequency curves were shown to be plausible and well behaved for catchments of \ndiverse characteristics, and to be consistent over a practically significant range of \nstorm durations (Siriwardena and Weinmann 1998). \n \n \nUnited Kingdom: 1) Flood Studies Report \n \nThe Flood Studies Report (FSR) method (NERC 1975) is not the most recently \ndeveloped rainfall frequency estimation method for the United Kingdom, but it is still \nthe standard for rainfalls of 1000 years return period or rarer. The method involves the \nmapping of an index variable, the 5-year return period rainfall, and derivation of \nregional growth curves applicable to durations from 15 seconds to 25 days. Two \nregions are used for the UK: England and Wales, and Scotland and Northern Ireland, \nbut within each region there are different growth curves depending on the magnitude \nof the index variable.  \n \n \nThe index variable \n \nThe 5-year return period rainfall, M5, for durations of 2 and 25 days was estimated \nusing a quartile analysis (outlined below) of the ordered AM rainfall series. In effect, \nM5 was estimated as the geometric mean of the upper half of the AM rainfall series \nfor each site. M5 for intermediate durations are obtained through interpolation in log \nspace. M5 values were also estimated for durations down to 1 minute using various \nrelationships. \n \n \nThe growth curve \n \nThe standardised growth curves were derived from non-standardised rainfall \nfrequency curves for the two regions. Initially, frequency curves were fitted \ngraphically using the results of quartile analyses of the AM rainfall series, as \ndescribed in the next section. When the logarithm of the rainfall was plotted against \nthe Gumbel reduced variate, the frequency curve was linear above a return period of 5 \nyears, with the slope of the curve decreasing with increasing M5 rainfall amounts in a \nsystematic manner regardless of duration. Dimensionless growth curves were derived \nby dividing the frequency curves by the M5 rainfall. Hence, the growth curves are \ndifferent for different values of M5 within the same region, but are the same for \ndifferent durations providing these have the same M5 value. Growth factors (points on \nthe growth curve) are presented in tables for M5 varying from 0.5 to 1000 mm. \n \n \nFitting a frequency curve using quartile analysis and highest observations \n \nIf a series of N annual rainfall maxima are arranged in ascending order, and plotted \nusing plotting positions, a graphically fitted smooth frequency curve can be drawn. \nThe FSR uses the plotting position suggested by Chegodayev (1953), \n 15 \n(m-0.31)\/(N+0.38), where m is the order of the maxima. However, the FSR also notes \nthat summary statistics from a quartile analysis of (long) series can be used to fit a \nfrequency curve, making it easier to combine many datasets into a comprehensive \nregional analysis. \n \nThe ordered series of AM are divided into four quarters, or quartiles. The geometric \nmeans of each quartile can be shown to correspond to particular return periods. For \nexample, the highest quartile gives the 10-year rainfall. Two different ways of \nforming halves of the series are also considered. The geometric mean of the middle \nhalf (i.e. the middle two quartiles) corresponds to the 2-year rainfall (M2) and the \ngeometric mean of the upper half corresponds to the 5-year rainfall (M5, which is \nused as the index variable).  \n \nThe series are divided into classes depending on the magnitude of the M5 rainfall, and \nstandardised using division by M5. Within each class, the medians (as defined in the \nFSR) of the standardised M2, M5 and M10 values across the stations in the class are \nplotted, together with some other information from the individual series. For high \nreturn periods the following approach is used. If the network of stations is not too \ndense, the largest (standardised) value from each series is put into a pooled dataset, \nwhich can then be plotted in a variant of the station-year approach to regionalisation. \nThat is, the largest values are assumed to be the largest in a very long, pooled, time \nseries (for example, 175 stations \u00d7 60 years = 10,500 station years for the class with \n2-day M5 between 40 and 50 mm in England and Wales). Thus, points are plotted \ncorresponding to return periods of several thousands of years. \n \n \nUnited Kingdom: 2) Flood Estimation Handbook \n \nThe rainfall frequency estimation method of the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) is \ndescribed by Faulkner (1999). It uses the FORGEX method for rainfall frequency \nestimation (Reed et al. 1999) followed by the fitting of a depth-duration-frequency \n(DDF) model. Values of the six parameters for the DDF model are available on a \n1-km grid on the FEH CD-ROM, together with software to provide design rainfall \nestimates for both individual points and catchment areas. FORGEX, which is a \ndevelopment of the FORGE method (Reed and Stewart 1989), is an index-flood \nmethod. For the growth curve, it pools data from expanding circular regions centred \non the point of interest, or focal point. Because the regions vary only slightly between \nadjacent sites, the resulting growth curves vary relatively smoothly across the country.  \n \nAlthough the recommended upper limit of the FEH method is for rainfalls up to 2000 \nyears return period (based on the range of return periods involved in the underlying \ndata analyses), the software allows extrapolation to 10,000 years for pragmatic \nreasons. Since its release several papers have been written on the differences in results \nbetween the FEH and the FSR, mainly critisising the extrapolation in the FEH DDF \nmodel (using a log-Gumbel distribution and extrapolating beyond the return period \nthat can be estimated from the data) and the fact that the dependence model assumed \nthe dependence between rainfall at different sites to be constant rather than decreasing \nwith increasing return period (e.g. Babtie Group 2000; MacDonald and Scott 2001; \nClark 2002; Cox 2003). These issues resulted in the new FEH 10,000-year estimates \nbeing considerably larger than the previous FSR rainfalls, and not infrequently \n 16 \nexceeding the FSR PMP estimates. Official guidance was therefore given to panel \nengineers (Defra 2010) that the FEH rainfall estimates should not entirely replace the \nold FSR estimates. Thus both methods have been the design standard for the UK since \n1999, for different return periods: the FEH for the 193- and 150-year return periods \n(for use when estimating the 150-year flood event); the highest of the two methods for \nthe 1000-year return period; and the FSR only for the 10,000-year return period.  \n \nOther potential problems are that possible effects of topographical variables on the \ngrowth curve are not taken into account (although they are for the index variable), and \nthat some boundary effects due to the uneven spatial distribution of rain gauges with \nlong rainfall records have been noted. \n \n \nThe index variable \n \nThe index variable is the median AM rainfall at the site, RMED. Values of RMED for \neight rainfall durations between 1 hour and 8 days were estimated at stations with \nrecord lengths of at least 9 years. The estimates will still be susceptible to climatic \nfluctuations, but the chosen minimum record length is a compromise between having \ntoo short and too few series. RMED was mapped over the UK on a 1-km grid using \ngeoregression on topographical and other variables (Faulkner and Prudhomme 1998).  \n \n \nThe growth curve \n \nFORGEX pools data from a hierarchy of expanding circular regions centred on the \npoint of interest (Figure 2). Data from smaller networks are used to estimate the \ngrowth curve for short return periods and data from the larger networks are used for \nthe longer return periods. The size of a region is a compromise between keeping a \nregion small, and therefore relevant, and avoiding excessive extrapolation beyond the \ninformation available in the region to obtain high return period rainfall estimates. An \nupper limit of 200 km is used for the largest network radius. \n \nThe derivation of the growth curve uses a complex empirical approach, combining a \nregional frequency analysis with an analysis of network maximum points whose \nplotting positions are shifted to allow for spatial dependence of extremes. \nStandardised AM (standardised through division by RMED) from individual records \nwith a minimum length of 10 years are ranked and plotted on a Gumbel reduced \nvariate scale using the Gringorten plotting position. Note that records are not pooled \ninto one long series the way they are in the CRC-FORGE method. Instead, data for \ndifferent sites are superposed on the plot (Figure 3). \n \nNot all points are plotted, and only points which are plotted are used to fit the growth \ncurve. Data from sites within progressively larger regions are used to estimate \nsections of the growth curve corresponding to greater and greater return periods. \nThus, data points from within the jth network are only plotted if their plotting position \nfalls within the jth section of the growth curve. Each section, or y-slice, has width 1.0 \non the Gumbel reduced variate scale, starting at y = 0.3665, which corresponds to the \nposition of the median (T = 2 years).  \n \n 17 \n \n \nFigure 2. Networks (regions) of daily rain gauges focused on Leicester (from \nFaulkner (1999) \u00a9 NERC (CEH)). \n \nTwo different groups of data series are recognised. Firstly, there are series of \nstandardised values from individual stations. Because few stations have more than \nabout 100 years of records, there are few points plotted at a return period larger than \n200 years. Secondly, there are network maximum (netmax) series, defined as the AM \nseries of the largest standardised value recorded anywhere within the region. Thus, \nthere is one netmax value per year. Because of spatial dependence in the network of \nrain gauges, the plotting positions for the netmax points have been modified using a \nspatial dependence model (see next section). \n \nFor a given duration, an empirical growth curve consisting of concatenated linear \nsegments is fitted to the plotted points (both individual and netmax) through a least-\nsquares routine. Finally, a depth-duration-frequency (DDF) model is fitted to avoid \nany contradictions between durations or return periods. This is an exponential curve \non the Gumbel reduced variate scale, fitted to all durations (1, 2, 6, 12 hours, and 1, 2, \n4, 8 days) and return periods (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 years) at once, \nusing a least-squares criterion. \n \n \n \n \n 18 \n \n \nFigure 3. Individual points (dots), netmax points (numbers) and fitted empirical \ngrowth curve for 1-day rainfalls focused on Leicester (from Faulkner \n(1999) \u00a9 NERC (CEH)). \n \n \nThe spatial dependence model \n \nDales and Reed (1989) show that the distribution of the network maximum from N \nindependent and identically distributed GEV distributions lies exactly lnN to the left \nof the regional growth curve (the \u201ctypical\u201d growth curve for a station in the region) on \na Gumbel reduced variate scale. Reed and Stewart (1994) note that this result is not \nrestricted to the GEV. In practice, because of inter-site dependence in annual maxima, \nthe netmax growth curve is found to lie a shorter distance to the left. Dales and Reed \nlabel this distance lnNe, terming Ne the effective number of independent gauges. Thus, \nspatial dependence can be assessed from the relationship between the typical and \nnetwork maximum growth curves. Conversely, the fitting of the regional growth curve \ncan be aided by information on spatial dependence. In particular, if an estimate of Ne \nis available, the top part of the netmax series can provide valuable information to \nguide the extension of the regional growth curve to long return periods.  \n \n 19 \nDales and Reed (1989) developed a model of spatial dependence to estimate the offset \ndistance, lnNe, for any rain gauge network. The UK model relates dependence to the \ngeometry of the rain gauge network:  \n \nlnNe \/ lnN =  0.081 + 0.085 lnAREA \u2013 0.051 lnN \u2013 0.027 lnD  (5)  \n \nwhere N is the number of gauges and D the rainfall duration in days. AREA is a \nnominal area spanned by the network. \n \nFor each network in turn, the netmax series is constructed and the values ranked. If \nthe same gauges were available for each year of record, the plotting position of each \npoint would effectively include a shift to the right on the Gumbel reduced variate \nscale by lnNe. Because the number of operational rain gauges, N, has varied greatly \nover the past two centuries, a more complicated determination of the plotting \npositions is needed as described by Jones (1997). \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThis review has outlined methods for rainfall estimation used nationwide in nine \ndifferent countries. Although some of the individual components of the methods may \nbe the same in several countries, the way they are combined in the final methods vary. \nA summary is provided in Table 1. The advantages and disadvantages of the various \nchoices of statistical distribution, fitting techniques, types of data, regionalisation, \ndata pooling and spatial dependence are discussed below. For the index-flood \napproach, the choice of index variable and characteristics of the growth curves are \nalso considered. \n \n \nStatistical distributions and fitting methods \n \nThe parameters for statistical frequency distributions can be estimated using various \nmethods. Product moments, such as the standard deviation, are sensitive to outliers in \nthe data, and L-moment parameters are generally considered more robust (e.g. \nStedinger et al. 1993). L-moments are linear combinations of the observations, and \nthus do not involve squaring or cubing the observed values as do product moments. \nPWMs are equivalent to L-moments (each set of moments are linear combinations of \nthe other).  \n \nOther fitting methods include fitting a regression line, generally using a least-squares \nfit, to points plotted using plotting positions on an appropriate scale so that they \u2013 \nideally \u2013 form a straight line. Maximum likelihood estimators would not appear to be \nin use, possibly because the numerical calculations are time consuming and may not \nconverge if the fit to the data is poor. Both these problems would be troublesome on a \nlarger, national, scale compared with smaller studies. For the commonly used GEV \ndistribution, L-moment estimators also compare favourably with those from \nmaximum likelihood methods, particularly for small sample sizes (15-25 samples) \n(Hosking et al. 1985). \n \n 20 \nIn some countries a Gumbel distribution is used, partly because estimation of a shape \nparameter from short records is not justified for individual sites, but also to avoid the \neffect of outliers on the parameters. However, a distribution having more parameters \n(including a non-fixed shape parameter) may be necessary to obtain an adequate \nrepresentation of the data. Rainfall extremes for at least some durations in parts of \nScandinavia (Alexandersson et al. 2001), France (M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France 2007) and New \nZealand (Thompson 2002) do not follow a Gumbel distribution. Shape parameters can \nbe estimated with more confidence when a whole area displays the same \ncharacteristics, so that information can be transferred to estimate the distribution for a \ngiven site. Distributions with three (or more) parameters are therefore commonly used \nwhen sites have been regionalised into homogeneous zones, whereas the Gumbel is \nmore suitable for single-site analysis. Most countries have one or two preferred \nstatistical distributions, but the United States choose from a variety which, given that \nit is a large country with many different climates, makes it more likely that there will \nbe a good fit to the regional data. \n \n \nBlock maxima and POT data \n \nAll countries surveyed use AM rainfall data, which are generally readily available and \neasy to extract. In addition, some countries like France and Germany use POT series \n(i.e. selecting a certain number of peaks on average each year) to increase the amount \nof data analysed, particularly when only short data series are available. There is some \nevidence that estimates of T-year events given by the POT approach have greater \nprecision than estimates given by the annual maxima approach (e.g. Cunnane 1973, \nMadsen et al. 1997). Using a larger amount of data, including selecting a fixed \nnumber (>1) of extremes in each year, should improve the rainfall frequency \nestimates. However, Buishand (1986) warns that although extending a sample with \nlower observations may reduce the standard error of the quantile estimates, it may \nlead to an increase in the systematic errors of the estimates of large quantiles: this \nrelates to how representative the lower observations are of the extremes of the \npopulation. \n \nAnother way of retrieving extra information for the frequency analysis is to use block \nmaxima from blocks that are smaller than a year, like a month or a season, and \nsubsequently derive the annual rainfall distribution from these seasonal distributions. \nDickinson (1977) argued that, by estimating the annual exceedance levels from \nmonthly rather than annual maxima, the effect of anomalously high data points on the \nreturn level estimates is reduced. A similar effect should occur for division into two \nseasons, as in the French GRADEX method. When investigating ways of taking \nseasonality into account, Carter and Challenor (1981) found (for the UK) annual \nreturn levels estimated from monthly maxima to be larger than those estimated \ndirectly from annual maxima. However, Tabony (1983) argued that this may be \nbecause monthly maxima are drawn from too small a population (he estimated there \nwould only be about 10 independent observations in a month for meteorological \napplications), and may not necessarily be extreme values. This problem would be \nsmaller using seasonal maxima.  \n \n \n 21 \nRegionalisation \n \nMost countries except France use some way of incorporating information from nearby \nsites when estimating the rainfall frequencies at a target point. Sweden, the United \nStates and South Africa use regions with fixed boundaries, which mean that care \nneeds to be taken to ensure a smooth transition of the rainfall estimates across the \nborders. The \u201cregion of influence\u201d approaches used in New Zealand, Australia and the \nUK (FEH), for which the regions are centred on the site of interest, by design result in \nrelatively smoothly changing rainfall estimates for nearby sites. Although the \nCanadian method does not include a regionalisation in the sense discussed above, the \nuse of isolines when mapping the statistical parameters (in the older atlas of Hogg and \nCarr (1985)) means that there will be a certain amount of smoothing of the \nparameters. The German method applies spatial interpolation techniques to get rainfall \nestimates on a grid. These techniques are different for summer, winter and the whole \nyear, enabling the seasonal characteristics of the precipitation to be represented.  \n \nThe size of a region is a trade-off between how homogeneous it is and how much data \nit can provide for the regionalised frequency estimate. The FSR\u2019s (NERC 1975) \ndivision of the UK into only two regions \u2013 albeit with the growth curves varying with \nM5 \u2013 means that rainfall frequency estimates show little spatial variability, and a \ncriticism of the method has been that it does not capture local anomalies well.  \n \n \nData pooling and spatial dependence \n \nData from within each homogeneous region can be used in different ways for the \nregional analysis. For example, L-moment ratios or PWMs estimated for each \nindividual standardised rainfall series can be averaged for the region  and weighted by \nrecord length (United States, South Africa, New Zealand), or all the standardised \nannual maxima can be pooled together into a single long series in a station-year \napproach (Sweden, Australia) or network maxima approach (UK). Spatial dependence \nin rainfall observations affects all approaches. Hosking and Wallis (1997) used Monte \nCarlo simulations to investigate the effect of correlation between stations within a \nregion on the growth curve derived using L-moments. They concluded that the \nresulting bias is small but that the variability of the regional growth curve increases \nwith increasing correlation. Inter-site dependence thus acts similarly to a reduction in \nthe number of sites in the region, and after a certain point, the addition of sites with \nobservations at the same time points as the other sites merely duplicates information \nalready obtained from the other sites. When investigating the application of the \nstation-year method for an area in the Netherlands, Buishand (1984) estimated a \ndependence function for the annual maxima, and found that, except where the inter-\nstation distance is small, the data are effectively asymptotically independent. He \nconcluded that for this area the station-year method can be applied to AM data \nprovided that the stations are separated by at least 30 km.  \n \nThe Australian CRC-FORGE (Weinmann et al. 1999) and UK FEH (Faulkner 1999) \nmethods both explicitly model the spatial dependence in the rainfall data and takes it \ninto account for the analyses. However, whereas CRC-FORGE allows the dependence \nto decrease with increasing return period, the FEH assumes that the dependence is \nconstant. It has been argued that this, together with the extrapolation method in the \n 22 \nFEH DDF model (fitting a log-Gumbel distribution), is the reason why the FEH \n10,000-year estimates are considerably larger than the previous FSR rainfalls, not \ninfrequently exceeding the FSR PMP estimates (e.g. Babtie Group 2000; MacDonald \nand Scott 2001; Clark 2002; Cox 2003).  \n \nThe use of a spatial dependence model enables attribution of a much higher return \nperiod to an observation than implied by the length of the individual rain gauge \nrecord. This confers a sense of increased confidence in the higher rainfall quantile \nestimates, but it should be borne in mind that spatial dependence may be more \ncomplex than currently allowed for in the models. \n \n \nThe index variable \n \nThe countries using an index-flood approach need to derive an index variable that is \nused for scaling the rainfall data so that the scaled values follow a common growth \ncurve. Using the median of the AM rainfall series gives a more stable estimate than \nthe mean, as it is less sensitive to outliers. Australia uses the 50-year return period \nrainfall to make the higher return period rainfall estimates seamlessly continuous with \nthe estimates previously obtained from the Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR \n1987; reprinted 2001) method. This could result in larger uncertainty compared with \nusing the median or mean of the AM rainfall series.  \n \n \nGrowth curve \n \nThe growth curve, a frequency curve for standardised rainfall, is used with index-\nflood methods and allows data from different locations to be pooled together. Most \nmethods fit different growth curves to different durations, but Smithers and Schulze \n(2003) noticed for South Africa that the 1-day L-moment ratios generally fell within \nthe 90% confidence intervals computed for other durations (from 30 minutes to 7 \ndays). Hence, they use the same (1-day) growth curve for all durations. Provided that \nthe value of the index variable increases with increasing duration at the same site, this \nshould avoid the potential problem of frequency curves crossing at high return periods \nfor different durations (i.e. it cannot rain more in, say, 1 hour than it does in 2 hours \nfor the same return period). This is a simple and appealing approach, making use of \nreliable daily rainfall observations to improve the growth curve estimate for other \ndurations with less reliable records. The approach can potentially be validated as \nincreasingly longer records of short-duration data become available. \n \nThe FSR (NERC 1975) uses the same growth curve for all rainfalls with a particular \nM5 value, regardless of duration. This is an unusual feature, although it seems \nsupported by the limited evidence presented in the FSR. At each location, the growth \ncurve will still vary with duration (as is generally the case), as the M5 values increase \nwith increasing duration. \n \n \n 23 \nSummary and conclusions \n \nThe rainfall frequency estimation methods currently in use in nine different countries \nare described: Canada, Sweden, France, Germany, the United States, South Africa, \nNew Zealand, Australia and the UK. There is considerable difficulty in estimating \nlong return period rainfalls from short data records and there is no obviously \u201cbest\u201d \nway of doing it. Each country\u2019s method is different, but most use some form of \nregionalisation to transfer information from surrounding sites to the target point. \nSeveral are variations of a regionalisation method that combines a local estimate of an \nindex variable (typically the mean or median annual maximum rainfall) with a \nregionally-derived growth curve to obtain a design rainfall estimate. Regionalisation \ngenerally involves the delineation of homogeneous regions, selection of a regional \nprobability distribution function, and parameter estimation. The boundaries of the \nregions can be fixed, or the regions can be centred on the point of interest so that the \nboundaries vary for each subject site. Three of the methods use site-centred rather \nthan fixed-boundary regions. Different statistical distributions and fitting methods are \nused in different countries, with the GEV distribution being the most common. \n \nThere is a trade-off between the straightforwardness of a method and the size of the \nreturn period for which a rainfall can be reliably estimated: different countries use \nmethods of different complexity. While regionalisation methods are attractive in \nallowing rainfalls for higher return periods to be estimated, caution is needed in \nregard both to the homogeneity of any region used and to the adequacy of the \nadjustment made, if any, for the effects of dependence. Diagnostic checking of the \nassumptions involved in either of these questions is typically not possible because of \nthe shortness of the records available, which is the very reason for considering \nregionalisation. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis review was undertaken as part of the UK Defra-funded project \u201cReservoir Safety \n\u2013 Long Return Period Rainfall\u201d (WS194\/2\/39). \n \nThe authors are much obliged to staff at the different hydrological and meteorological \norganisations who read and commented on the drafts describing each country\u2019s \nmethods: Robert Morris at Environment Canada; Lennart Wern at the Swedish \nMeteorological and Hydrological Institute; Jean-Michel Veysseire at M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France; \nGabriele Malitz at Deutscher Wetterdienst; Sanja Perica at the Hydrometeorological \nDesign Studies Center within NOAA, US; Jeff Smithers at the University of Natal, \nSouth Africa; Craig Thompson and Graeme Horrell at the National Institute of Water \nand Atmospheric Research, New Zealand; and Erwin Weinmann at Monash \nUniversity, Australia. \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAlexandersson, H., F\u00f8rland, E.
