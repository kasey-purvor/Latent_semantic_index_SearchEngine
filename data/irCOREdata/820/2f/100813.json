Using\npaper substrates of differing surface roughness, field emission threshold fields ranging from\n0.8 to 11.6 V\/\u0001m were observed, varying in an approximate inverse linear log relationship with the\nsurface roughness of the underlying paper substrate. This study shows how field emission from\nsupported nanotube films can be tailored via the morphology of the scaffold substrate, and how\nthese composite electrodes can be straightforwardly fabricated on cheap, flexible substrates. \u00a9 2007\nAmerican Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2734379\u0004\nCarbon nanotubes \u0001CNTs\u0002 are known for their excellent\nfield emission properties1\u20134 owing to their large aspect ratio\nand high electrical conductivity.5 They also possess high me-\nchanical integrity and chemical inertness. Consequently,\nCNTs have been extensively investigated as cold cathodes\nfor lighting and flat panel displays.6\u20139 The realization of low\ncost, large area CNT cathodes is crucial if these devices are\nto become contenders in the marketplace. Several groups\nhave experimented with field emitting inks and inkjet print-\ning of CNTs for electronics applications.10\u201315 Ink jet printing,\ndip coating, screen printing, and processing on flexible sub-\nstrates all lend themselves to industrialization and continuous\nmanufacturing processes, with obvious cost benefits over\nvacuum deposition, thermal evaporation, or chemical vapor\ndeposition.\nThe morphology of a field emitting surface plays a cru-\ncial role in determining its field emission properties.16,17 It is\nthe local field at the emission site that governs emission, so\nmicron and nanoscale protrusions can greatly enhance the\nemission due to increased field concentration above their sur-\nfaces. This enhancement is generally described by the field\nenhancement factor \u0001\u0002\u0002, which is the factor by which the\nlocal electric field exceeds the macroscopic applied electric\nfield. Therefore, by altering the morphology of an emitter, \u0002\nand consequently the field emission properties would be ex-\npected to vary.\nIn this letter, we present a method for homogeneously\ncoating paper substrates with multiwall carbon nanotubes\n\u0001MWNTs\u0002 via a straightforward dip coating technique. The\nfield emitting properties of these substrates were investigated\nas a function of the surface roughness \u0001and thereby the mor-\nphology\u0002 of the underlying paper substrate. This technique\nbrings about the possibility of directly depositing nanotubes\nin a controlled manner onto a plethora of prepatterned sub-\nstrates with surface morphology chosen to maximize \u0002.\nThe graphitic surface of MWNTs renders them hydro-\nphobic and it is notoriously difficult to obtain a stable dis-\npersion in common organic solvents without chemical de-\nrivatization of the outer surface. Stable aqueous dispersions\nare commonly formed by refluxing MWNTs in a concen-\ntrated nitric and sulfuric acid mixture, resulting in the forma-\ntion of oxygen containing moieties including carboxylic acid\ngroups attached to the MWNT ends and sidewalls which\ninteract with water molecules via hydrogen bonding.15 Acid\ntreatment also serves to purify MWNTs removing catalytic\nparticles and amorphous carbon. For the sake of clarity, acid\noxidized MWNTs will herein be referred to as o-MWNTs.\nHigh purity \u000195%\u0002 MWNTs with a nominal diameter of\n10 nm were purchased from Nanocyl and ultrasonically dis-\npersed in a 3:1 concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid mixture\nfor 10 mins. The mixture was refluxed at 110 \u00b0C for 40 min\nbefore diluting with de-ionized water. Large particles and\nagglomerates were removed from the solution by centrifug-\ning. The centrifuged liquid was carefully decanted, filtered\nthrough a 0.2 \u0001m polycarbonate membrane, and washed\nwith de-ionized water until a slurry with pH 6\u20137 was ob-\ntained. This slurry was added to a small amount of de-\nionized water, which was sonicated to disperse the tubes. The\nresulting product was a stable dispersion of o-MWNTs. The\no-MWNT loading \u00013.5 mg\/ml\u0002 was determined by drying\nand weighing a portion of the o-MWNT ink. A variety of\ndifferent grades of commercially available paper was dipped\ninto the o-MWNT ink, removed and baked at 150 \u00b0C for\n10 min to remove residual water. This resulted in a thick,\nblack coating of o-MWNTs on the paper\u2019s surface.\nA profilometer was used to measure the average surface\nroughness \u0001RA\u0002 of the surfaces of different types of paper,\nwhich varied from 1.3 to 9.8 \u0001m. Measurements were car-\nried out over a 2 mm scan length, and an average of ten\nmeasurements across the substrate surface \u0001\u00051 cm2\u0002 were\nperformed.\nScanning electron microscopy of the various substrates\nis presented in Fig. 1. Figures 1\u0001a\u0002\u20131\u0001c\u0002 show the morphol-\nogy of the paper scaffold with the lowest surface roughness\nafter the o-MWNT dip coating process. Figures 1\u0001d\u0002\u20131\u0001f\u0002\nshow the morphology of the paper substrate found to have\nthe largest surface roughness. The difference between the\ntwo samples is clear; the sample with low RA has relatively\nfew, widely spaced surface features, and the substrate with\nhigh RA comprises large, closely packed protruding features.\nBoth samples show 100% surface coverage by the o-MWNT\nink.\nThe field emission properties of the paper substrates\nwere investigated at 10\u22126 mbar in a simple diode configura-\ntion, with a 5-mm-diameter spherical stainless steel anode.a\u0002Electronic mail: s.lyth@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 90, 173124 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/90\u000217\u0001\/173124\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics90, 173124-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The anode voltage\n\u0001dc\u0002 was incremented in 30 V steps. The macroscopic elec-\ntric field \u0001E\u0002 was calculated by dividing the applied voltage\nby the electrode gap, typically 200 \u0001m. The threshold field\n\u0001Eth\u0002 was defined as the macroscopic electric field at which\nan emission current of 1 nA was detected. The average Eth\nwas calculated over six widely spaced emission sites on each\nsample, with the voltage cycled up and down five times at\neach site.\nField emission data are presented in Table I and plotted\nin Fig. 2. Figure 2\u0001a\u0002 shows emission current versus macro-\nscopic electric field for all the substrates. The threshold field\nwas observed to vary from 0.8 to 11.6 V\/\u0001m. It should be\nnoted that very little hysteresis is observed between the up\nand down cycles and that no initial conditioning was ob-\nserved in the first cycle. Fowler Nordheim graphs18\n\u0003Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004 were plotted using the current-field data and the\nenhancement factors \u0001\u0002\u0002 of the different samples were cal-\nculated from the slopes, taking the work function to be\n5.0 eV.19 A large difference between the slopes of the plots\ncan easily be observed, resulting in a wide range in \u0002 from\n\u0005500 for relatively smooth paper \u0001RA=1.3 \u0001m\u0002 to \u00055000\nfor the roughest paper \u0001RA=9.8 \u0001m\u0002.\nThese extremely low threshold fields and high enhance-\nment factors are attributed to the fact that the underlying\npaper substrates have protruding features with high aspect\nratios, contributing to a high geometric field enhancement\nand therefore high local fields at the emission sites. The very\nhigh values of \u0002 could be partly due to a giant multistage\ngeometric enhancement effect arising from the product of the\nseparate enhancement factors of the paper substrate and the\no-MWNT coating.20\nFigure 3 shows Eth as a function of RA for the samples.

A clear trend can be observed, where the field\nemission characteristics improve as RA increases. This can be\nrelated to the morphology of the films: the smoothest films\nhave relatively few surface features \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004, therefore\nhaving a very low geometric field enhancement factor, result-\ning in relatively high threshold fields. The roughest films\nhave an uneven morphology with many surface features\n\u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004 and therefore a high geometric field enhancement\nfactor, resulting in low threshold fields. The statistical error\nin the measurements can be seen on the error bars in Fig. 3,\nthough this clearly does not account for all the errors. This is\nprobably due to the fact that using RA as a gauge of surface\nmorphology is a simplistic approach. Other factors such as\nthe aspect ratios of surface features, curvature at surfaces,\nand the specific morphology of the substrates are clearly im-\nportant, but difficult to combine and describe numerically on\nsamples with such complex surfaces.\nIn conclusion, flexible field emitters were fabricated with\na range of extremely low turn on fields \u0001\u00031 V\/\u0001m\u0002 and high\ngeometric field enhancement factors on insulating, flexible\nsubstrates. A trend of improved field emission characteristics\nwith increased surface roughness was observed. The wide\nrange in Eth and \u0002 show how relatively straightforward it is\nto tailor field emission characteristics using simple fabrica-\ntion techniques. This technique provides a cheap, low tem-\nperature method of manufacturing efficient field emitters via\ninkjet printing, dip coating, or screen printing onto readily\navailable, flexible substrates.\nThe authors would like to thank EPSRC \u0001UK\u0002 for fund-\ning this research via the CBE and Portfolio Partnership pro-\ngrams.
