The language of Wednesbury unreasonableness and\nultra vires increasingly gives way to talk about rights, proportionality\nand deference. This semantic recasting of judicial review reflects deeper\nmutations that go to the very heart of the discipline. These changes,\nbecause they are structural and fundamental, may well in time come to\nbe spoken of in the way that we speak now of those foundational turn-\nof-the-century cases1 that induced Dicey to revoke his hostility to the\nvery idea of administrative law,2 or the \u201cfairness revolution\u201d3 in judicial\nreview in the 1960s.\nThe era we are leaving, one still haunted by the ghosts of that for-\nmer age, and especially the \u201cHoly Trinity\u201d of \u201860s cases, Ridge v.\nBaldwin,4 Anisminic,5 and Padfield,6 had at its core concerns relating to\nthe examination of powers and procedures. The animating belief of\nthat system was, in essence, a formalist one. Through the policing of\nParliament\u2019s grants of power to subordinate officials (the core of the\nnotion of ultra vires) and the application of judge-made principles of\nprocedural fairness would abuses of public power be curtailed and the\nrule of law maintained. The individual was, in a sense, fundamental\nwithin this structure \u2013 for why else operate a complicated system de-\nsigned to protect against potential governmental overreach if not ulti-\nmately in the interest of individuals? But, in another sense, the\nindividual was marginal to the business of the court, providing a trigger\nfor an action but not necessarily the focal point of legal analysis and\nargument.

Within this framework, rights\nspecifically and substantive review more generally were not so much\noutlawed as repressed. The curious and ambivalent nature of the\nWednesbury formula \u2013 the test governing substantive review until the\nrecent advent of proportionality \u2013 exemplifies this predicament. The\ntest \u2013 judges should not interfere with a governmental decision unless\nthat decision was \u201cso unreasonable that no reasonable authority could\never have come to it\u201d8 \u2013 was in a double sense peripheral. Not only did\nit apply, in its ungainly and circuitous manner, to a subset of marginal\n(exceptional, \u201cextreme\u201d) instances of governmental misbehaviour \u2013 a\nlong-stop category, if you like. To that extent, the test was a self-\ndenying ordinance well suited to the post-war era of judicial austerity\nwhich produced it.9 But it was also peripheral in the sense of being an\noutlier to the conceptual system of which it was part. Whereas it was\n(fairly) easy to make sense of powers and process review under the old\nframework, substantive review in general and the Wednesbury test\nmore specifically remained the odd one out. Since, whatever the at-\ntempts to disguise it, the fundamentally substantive nature of the test \u2013\nit asks the courts to inquire, after all, into \u201creasonableness\u201d \u2013 jarred\nwith the formalist presuppositions of the general conceptual framework\nthe courts said they were applying.\nThe marginal nature of Wednesbury may explain some of the\ncomplications that surrounded its application. Certainly, the self-\ndenying \u2013 indeed almost savagely limited10 \u2013 nature of the test and its\nlack of fit with the conceptual apparatus within which it operated\nmeant that rights and other substantive interests were often corralled\nwithin the test at pain of self-contradiction. (\u201cUnreasonable, perhaps;\nbut really so unreasonable \u2026?\u201d) Alternatively \u2013 and more commonly \u2013\nsubstantive interests were worked into judgments beneath the surface\nof concepts, so to speak, typically smuggled in under the capacious and\n7 See, e.g., D.

Indeed, the more persuasive arguments for increased sub-\nstantive review picked up on this characteristic of the old order, and\nheld out the prospect that new concepts like proportionality might\nmake the judges more honest in their reasoning.14\nRights and substantive review, like Cinderella, have escaped sub-\nservient positions to take centre stage. The extent of this transform-\nation is such that it would take a brave theorist today to deny rights\nsome substantial role in contemporary public law. (There is plenty of\nroom to disagree on the precise nature of the role of rights,15 however,\nor about whether the recent influx of rights is ultimately a good thing.16)\nFor the era we are now entering is marked by a much more direct and\nfrequent recourse to arguments about rights \u2013 especially but not ex-\nclusively those of the European Convention on Human Rights\n(\u201cECHR\u201d)17 \u2013 and other substantive considerations. A recent study\nconducted by the author and a colleague found, for instance, that\nthe incidence of human rights and rights-related cases has increased\n11 See, e.g., S.

While there had been an increase in rights\ntalk in cases like Bugdaycay,19 Witham20 and Smith,21 only the intro-\nduction of the HRA facilitated the kind of deep, structural change we\nhave seen since.22 The Act, by requiring courts to apply ECHR rights\nand to pay attention to the jurisprudence of the European Court of\nHuman Rights, squared the circle between the desire for a more up-\nfront application of substantive judicial review and the constitutional\nneed for Parliament to sanction such a development.23\nBut does this mean that the future of judicial review is now tied to\nthe destiny of the HRA? The hypothetical is worth pausing over since,\nif this were so, it would mean that the developments being touted here\nas fundamental are in fact fragile and quite possibly transient. If the\nAct facilitated the restructuring of judicial review, then does it not\nfollow that this restructuring could be undone by the repeal of that\nAct? Not necessarily. Even if reformation does induce counter-\nreformation and Parliament reverses its position on the issue of judge-\nprotected rights, this would not necessarily lead to a simple reversion to\nthe status quo ante. For this particular genie is one that would be hard\nto force back into the bottle. The current domestic trend towards\ngreater judicial protection of rights (and related developments con-\ncerning proportionality) runs with the grain of global developments in\npublic law and related fields,24 in which human rights seem to find more\nvaried and ever stronger juridical footholds. And it is unlikely that\nBritish courts, now they have learned this new language, are going to be\neasily induced to stop using it. Indeed, to do so now would be to put\nthem in direct conflict with the European Court of Human Rights\n(\u201cECtHR\u201d) which declared in the post-HRA case Smith and Grady v.\nUnited Kingdom25 that the protection of Convention rights afforded by\ntraditional English judicial review \u2013 and particularly the Wednesbury\ntest, even in its strongest, \u201canxious scrutiny\u201d manifestation26 \u2013 was\ninadequate.\n18 S.

Judicial review, at least the contexts where rights are in play, has\nadopted a different method \u2013 and with it, one suspects, a meaningfully\ndifferent function. The move from Wednesbury to proportionality is\ntotemic, as the judges who instigated it were well aware. In Daly, which\nmade proportionality the test of substantive review where (ECHR)\nrights are in play, Lord Cooke said that the \u201cview that the standards [of\nproportionality and Wednesbury] are substantially the same appears to\nhave reached its quietus in [the ECtHR decision in] Smith and Grady\u201d.27\nProportionality, Lord Steyn observed in the same case, is a \u201cmore\nprecise and more sophisticated\u201d test which allows for a \u201csomewhat\ngreater\u201d intensity of review than its predecessor: in particular, it \u201cmay\nrequire the reviewing court to assess the balance which the decision\nmaker struck\u201d and \u201cmay go further than the traditional grounds of\nreview as it may require attention to be directed to the relative weight\nto be accorded to interests and considerations\u201d.28 Academic commen-\ntators, free from the strictures of judge-speak, often go further when\nextrapolating the difference between old and new. The new method is\nseen, at least by some, to entail a radical move from older patterns of\njudicial review. \u201cWhat rights-centred adjudication has done \u2013 and this\nis revolutionary \u2013 is to fundamentally and irrevocably change the\nmethodology, and hence the rules, of the public law game.\u201d29\nTwo features of \u201cnew order\u201d judicial review can be highlighted.\nFirst, the lack of any built-in limit to the proportionality test \u2013 whereas\nthe essence of Wednesbury was its limiting, self-denying aspect (\u201cso\nunreasonable \u2026\u201d) proportionality is plastic and can in principle be\napplied almost infinitely forcefully or infinitely cautiously, producing\nan area of discretionary judgement that can be massively broad or in-\ncredibly narrow \u2013 and anything else between. (In fact, it is almost cer-\ntainly the very flexibility of proportionality that has driven the current\nacademic craze for discussing the notion of judicial \u201cdeference\u201d.30)\nSecond, whereas the focus of Wednesbury falls on the nature of the\nimpugned decision (\u201cwas it so extreme in its defiance of logic or of\naccepted moral standards \u2026?\u201d) proportionality aims more directly at\nprotecting the claimant\u2019s right(s). With this change in focus comes a\nchange in promise: judicial review in the old order offered (in the con-\ntext of substantive review) to protect against official behaviour at the\n27 R v.

Better to say that proportionality review\noffers the possibility of a different \u2013 and potentially deeper \u2013 inquiry\ninto the reasons offered by government for its interference with rights\nand similar interests.\nDoubtless, the normative assumptions that underpin proportion-\nality have the capacity to spill over into other areas of judicial review\nwhere rights are not necessarily directly in play. Rights also tend to\nhave their own logic and momentum, which lends them an imperialist\n(opponents would say necrotising) streak. But this is not to say that\neverything will change. Familiar tests relating to issues of delegation,\nimproper purpose, the relevancy of considerations, reason-giving, bias\nand so on will remain. (Indeed, they may even keep generating the\nlion\u2019s share of business within the Administrative Court.) Even\nWednesbury might survive as a test for unreasonableness outside the\ncontext of rights.32 It has done so (just) to date, despite calls for its head,\nalthough few would be surprised if the House of Lords stepped up\nto perform what one senior judge referred to as its \u201cburial rites\u201d33\n(perhaps to replace it, in emulation of a recent move of the Canadian\nSupreme Court,34 with a simpler test of \u201creasonableness\u201d). Judicial re-\nview will continue to resist the urge to recast it purely and simply as an\ninstrument for the protection of individual rights. And the perennial,\ndefining \u2013 perhaps even axiomatic \u2013 conflicts that beset judicial review\nin all contexts and places \u2013 between \u201cprivate rights and public advan-\ntage\u201d,35 technocratic expertise and democratic governance, politics and\nlaw \u2013 will continue to play out (although they will sound more fre-\nquently now in a rights-based register). One driver behind this state\nof affairs will be pressure from litigants, who will be drawn to the\n(relatively) powerful remedies that rights-based judicial review cur-\nrently offers. For rights-based litigation offers both a more direct route\n31 D. Dyzenhaus, \u201cThe Politics of Deference: Judicial Review and Democracy\u201d, in M.

As Mike Taggart puts it, why wander through maze\nof administrative law when you can cruise the motorway of consti-\ntutional law?\nBut while the general outlines of \u201creformation\u201d judicial review\nare becoming tolerably clear, significant dimensions remain under-\nexplored. Insufficient attention has been paid, in particular, to the\nrelationship between courts and administrators within the new frame-\nwork. Two questions concerning that relationship are addressed in this\narticle. First, should courts impose a general duty on public authorities\nto articulate their decisions in the language of rights and proportion-\nality? And, second, should courts give any weight to public authorities\u2019\nproportionality and rights-based assessments? These are defining\nquestions: the answers we give to them will help in significant measure\nto shape the nature of the new order of administrative law. Finding\ngood answers to these questions takes more than windy invocations of\nlawyer-friendly buzz phrases like \u201cthe rule of law\u201d, \u201cthe separation\nof powers\u201d or (a current favourite) \u201ca culture of rights\u201d. A better\napproach begins by examining doctrinal developments (actual and\npotential) in terms of their likely impact on public administration. Such\nan approach is pursued and defended here.\nProblem 1: The \u201cSin\u201d of Omission?\nThe first problem, which I call the (putative) sin of omission, centres on\nthe question of how the courts should respond when an agency has not\nconsciously approached the taking of the decision under review\nthrough a framework of rights. It addresses the question: do public\nauthorities now have to look at all relevant decisions through the prism\nof the European Convention? The issue was central in the Denbigh\nHigh School case. The case concerned the school\u2019s uniform requirement\nfor girls. The policy, which was adopted after wide consultation, was\ndesigned to satisfy religious requirements. The claimant, Shabina\nBegum, believed that the shalwar kameeze (trousers and tunic) \u2013 which\nwas permitted by the policy \u2013 did not comply with the requirements of\nher religion, and insisted that she should be allowed to wear the jilbab\n(a full-length dress). The school refused to allow her to attend the\nschool until she complied with the policy; Begum refused to attend\nunless she was allowed to wear the jilbab. She was subsequently ac-\ncepted at a different school.\nOverturning the first instance judgment,36 the Court of Appeal held\nthat Begum\u2019s right to religious freedom under Article 9 ECHR had\n36 [2004] EWHC 1389 (Admin); [2004] E.L.R. 374.\n148 The Cambridge Law Journal [2009]\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nbeen violated. The School authorities had erred, it said, in failing to\nconsider her case in an appropriately rights-responsive manner. More\nspecifically, they had not applied a full-scale proportionality analysis of\nthe case at hand,37 and for that reason the application should succeed.\n\u201cThe School did not approach the matter in this way at all. Nobody\nwho considered the issues on its behalf started from the premise that\nthe claimant had a right which is recognised by English law, and that\nthe onus lay on the School to justify its interference with that right.\u201d38\nNote that the judgment said nothing about whether as a matter of\nsubstance the School\u2019s decision to exclude Begum was justified; it re-\nlates solely to the decision-making process the School had followed\nwhen deciding Begum\u2019s situation.39 \u201cNothing in this judgment should\nbe taken as meaning that it would be impossible for the School to\njustify it stance if it were to reconsider its uniform policy in the light of\nthis judgment.\u201d40\nThe House of Lords allowed the school\u2019s appeal, the majority con-\nsidering that there had been no interference with Begum\u2019s Art. 9 rights\nsince the claimant and her family had chosen the school voluntarily and\ncould, without undue difficulty, have gone to another school where she\nwas allowed to wear a jilbab.41 The issue of justification under Art. 9(2)\nwas also considered, and the court held that the limitation on Begum\u2019s\nright to manifest her religion was justified. Lord Bingham criticised the\nprocedural approach of the Court of Appeal to this question. The focus\nof decision-making under the HRA, he said, was not on whether\na decision is the product of a defective process, but on whether the\napplicant\u2019s rights have been violated. Proportionality must be judged\nobjectively by the court, and a proceduralist approach would introduce\na new formalism into administrative practice.42 Lord Hoffmann\u2019s\ncriticism was more direct: Article 9 is concerned with substance, not\nprocedure and it confers no right to have a decision made in any\n37 R (SB) v.

(2) Subject to any justification that is\nestablished under Art. 9(2), has that Convention right been violated? (3) Was the interference with\nher Convention right prescribed by law in the Convention sense of that expression? (4) Did the\ninterference have a legitimate aim?

In some contexts it will be entirely appropri-\nate to require a decision-maker to bring its mind to bear directly on\nrights-related questions. Consider deportation decisions, for instance.\nEx p Razgar concerned a challenge to the Home Secretary\u2019s decision\nto certify as manifestly unfounded the applicant\u2019s claim that removal\nfrom the UK would amount to a breach of Article 8. (Razgar argued\nthat the psychiatric treatment and medication he was receiving for\npost-traumatic stress disorder and depression would not be replicated\nwere he to be returned to Germany under the terms of the Dublin\nConvention.) The House of Lords decided, by a majority, that the\nHome Secretary was not entitled to certify the case in this way. But\nwhat is important for our purposes is that all the Law Lords agreed\nthat the Home Secretary had to bring his mind to bear directly on the\nquestion of rights \u2013 in our terminology, that he had to approach the\nissue through the \u201cEuropean Convention prism\u201d. Lord Bingham, with\nwhom Lord Steyn and Lord Carswell agreed, said that where removal\nis resisted in reliance to Article 8 the Secretary of State must con-\nsider the same questions that an immigration adjudicator would ask,\nnamely:\n(1) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public\nauthority with the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for\nhis private or (as the case may be) family life?\n(2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity\nas potentially to engage the operation of article 8?\n(3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?\n(4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society in\nthe interests of national security, public safety or the economic\nwell-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or\ncrime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the pro-\ntection of the rights and freedoms of others?\n(5) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate public\nend sought to be achieved? 44\n43 Ibid., at [68].\n44 R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, [17].\n150 The Cambridge Law Journal [2009]\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nBaroness Hale in her dissenting speech agreed with the majority on this\npoint. The Home Secretary, she said, \u201chad to ask himself how an\nappeal might fare before an adjudicator. He also had to bear in mind\nthat the adjudicator is an integral part of the decision-making process\nand thus would have to consider the issue of proportionality on the\nevidence before him.\u201d45 The Court of Appeal had earlier taken a similar\napproach. Dyson L.J. said that it was \u201cclearly correct\u201d to say that the\nHome Secretary had to address, in the context of immigration control,\nspecific questions relating to the possible violation of ECHR rights:\n\u201c(a) to what extent (if at all) is the ECHR right engaged by their re-\nmoval; (b) what is the threshold of seriousness of harm; and (c) what is\nthe appropriate level of risk of that harm occurring. These questions\nmust be addressed by the Secretary of State when he considers whether\nto certify that an allegation of breach of human rights is manifestly\nunfounded\u201d under the relevant section of the Immigration and Asylum\nAct 1999.46\nAnother reason why the \u201csin of omission\u201d question will continue to\narise goes deeper. Some see the emerging pattern differently from the\nHouse of Lords in Denbigh. T.R.S. Allan has long regarded public law\nas a jurisprudence of rights.47 Turning his attention to recent doctrinal\nchanges, Allan celebrates the coherence gained as a result of \u201cthe\ngradual disappearance of rigid doctrinal barriers to judicial review\u201d\nand deplores the new doctrine of judicial deference which threatens, he\nsays, to play in adjudication under the HRA a similar role to that\nperformed by justiciability in a previous era. While he accepts that, in\nsome cases, courts should defer to decision-makers on democratic\ngrounds, \u201cany search for an independent theory or doctrine of defer-\nence is almost certainly misguided\u201d.48 Murray Hunt\u2019s theory of \u201cdue\ndeference\u201d is identified as an example of this (misguided) type.\nAlthough he doubts the value of \u201cspatial language of areas or margins\nof discretion\u201d, Hunt argues that a \u201crich conception of legality and the\nrule of law\u201d should accord \u201ca role for the democratic branches in the\ndefinition and furtherance of fundamental values\u201d.49 This position is\nanathema to Allan, who regards the task of articulating the nature and\nlimits of the (new) constitutional order as pre-eminently a matter for\nthe courts.\n45 Ibid., [60].\n46 R (Razgar) v.

English Administrative Law 151\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nAnother target of Allan\u2019s criticism is Laws L.J.\u2019s (dissenting) judg-\nment in International Transport Roth GmbH. In what amounts to an\nattempt to create a framework for the calibration of deference, Laws\nL.J. specified four principles for determining the level of deference\nowed by a court to a public authority. First, more deference should be\nshown to an Act of Parliament than to a subordinate measure or\nexecutive decision. Second, there is more scope for deference \u201cwhere\nthe Convention itself requires a balance to be struck, much less so\nwhere the right is stated in terms which are unqualified\u201d. Third, greater\ndeference is owed where the subject-matter is within the constitutional\nresponsibility of the decision-maker, and less when it lies within the\nconstitutional responsibility of the courts. Fourth, the degree of def-\nerence also depends on whether the subject-matter lies within the ex-\npertise of the decision-maker or the court.50 Allan finds this and like\napproaches objectionable largely because he sees the very notion of\ndeference as \u201cnon-justiciability dressed in pastel colours.\u201d51 Judicial\ndeference, he says, is either an empty or a pernicious doctrine. It is\nempty if it \u201cpurports to implement a separation of powers between the\ncourts and other branches of government\u201d, since such a separation is\nsecured by \u201cthe proper application of legal principles defining he scope\nof individual rights\u201d. It is pernicious if \u201cit permits the abdication of\njudicial responsibility in favour of reliance on the good faith or good\nsense or special expertise of public officials, whose judgments about the\nimplications of rights in specific cases may well be wrong\u201d.52 Thus, a\njudge who allows her own view of a case to be displaced by the contrary\nview of public officials should be considered to have \u201cforfeit[ed] the\nneutrality that underpins the legitimacy of constitutional adjudi-\ncation\u201d.53 Considerations not directly related to the right in question \u2013\nfor instance, those that relate to \u201ccharacteristics of the decision-maker\nor its procedures\u201d \u2013 are classified as \u201cexternal considerations\u201d inap-\npropriate for judicial consideration:\nThe only proper question for the court to consider is simply\nwhether or not the decision falls within the sphere of decision-\nmaking autonomy that the claimant\u2019s right, on its correct in-\nterpretation, allows. The relative expertise of the decision-maker\nand the excellence of its procedures are relevant insofar as they\ngenerate convincing arguments \u2013 good reasons for curtailing\nrights grounded in reasonable policies and supported by clear\nevidence. The court must be persuaded by the reasons, however,\nrather than impressed by expertise or procedural competence.54\n50 International Transport Roth GmbH v.

He argues that it is no longer\nappropriate for courts to defer on grounds of constitutional com-\npetence, which relates to the authority of the body to decide the relevant\nquestion. Although, unlike Allan, he sees it as generally appropriate for\na court to defer on grounds of institutional competence, which refers\nto the capacity (or relative expertise) of a body to make the relevant\ndecisions.57 David Beatty celebrates, with Allan, the fluid and anti-\nformalist character of \u201cnew-style\u201d judicial review. His book The\nUltimate Rule of Law is a paean to the proportionality principle, which\nis identified as the centrepiece of the new constitutional law.\nProportionality accounts, he says, for \u201cvirtually every case in which\ncourts have responded politically to protect people\u2019s general welfare\nand well being\u201d.58 In an argument intended to have general application,\nhe proposes the unencumbered use of the proportionality principle by\ncourts. Prudential arguments calling for courts to defer to the expertise\nof officials are to be rejected: proportionality is the \u201conly conceptual\napparatus judges have, and all that they need, to harmonize the\nautonomy of each person with the general will of the community\u201d.59\nIndeed, in his understanding of the subjective nature of rights and his\nwillingness to shut out \u201cexternal\u201d (non-rights based) elements from\njudicial consideration, Beatty goes further than Allan. His extreme\nposition culminates in the (ludicrous) claim: \u201cRather than evaluate the\ncompeting interests at stake against some external, objective standard\nor principle, judges try to assess the affected parties\u2019 own understand-\ning of how significant the law being tested is for them.\u201d60\nHow might advocates of this court-centred approach to the new\nframework of rights respond to the question posed at the start of this\nsection: how should a court respond when an agency has not con-\nsciously approached the issue at hand through a European Convention\nprism? The question is not specifically addressed in their work, but it is\nplausible to assume that they might favour the imposition of a general\n55 See also, e.g., Dyzenhaus, \u201cThe Politics of Deference\u201d, above note 31.\n56 J.

Certainly, this position is consistent\nwith some of the arguments Allan and Beatty make.61 If creating a\nculture of justification is the overriding objective, then requiring public\nauthorities to justify their decisions explicitly in terms of rights and\nrelated values might be seen as entirely justified. Only by requiring\npublic authorities to express themselves throughout the decision-\nmaking process in rights-based terms can we ensure that a rights-\nrespecting culture develops. Silence on the question of rights denotes a\nfailure to do what a good decision-maker is required to do: consider the\nimplications of its decisions in terms of the rights upon which they may\nimpact. Others commentators, who share the same root assumptions,\nhave already made this case. Tom Hickman, for instance, argues that\nthe Law Lords\u2019 rejection of a proceduralist approach to the application\nof proportionality amounts to the \u201cmuzzling\u201d of the HRA. He argues\nthat courts should instead set minimum requirements for decision\nmaking in human rights cases that require basic procedural steps to be\ntaken and, where reasons for a decision are appropriate, that show that\nthe decision maker has considered the impact of the decision on the\naffected person.62\nThis hardline position on rights makes sense only if one accepts two\nrelated propositions. First, that administrative law is essentially a\nvehicle for protecting the rights of individuals from the potential mis-\nuse of public power.63 Second, that such rights are fundamental aspects\nof personhood that can only be properly protected by courts.64 But\nthese propositions only work if administrative law is understood to\noperate as though it were a kind of hermetically sealed juridical order,\nremoved from the concerns and realities of government. The approach\nis flawed because it is blind (or insensitive) to institutional context65\nand, were it applied consistently to the \u201csin of omission\u201d question,\nwould make a mockery of rights-based judicial review. By requiring (as\nthe Court of Appeal did in Denbigh) that decisions should be struck\ndown on the basis of purely procedural flaws \u2013 any mistaken appli-\ncation by administrators of the lawyers\u2019 test of proportionality \u2013 this\n61 Although their position might be interpreted rather differently: essentially as an argument in\nfavour of substantive as opposed to procedural justice. This reading would generate a different\nanswer to our first question \u2013 courts should not impose a general duty on public authorities to\nmake decisions consciously and explicitly on the basis of Convention rights as that would deflect\nthe \u201crights revolution\u201d from its proper substantive\/normative orientation towards an uncalled-for\nfocus on formalities and procedure.\n62 T.

They realized that a requirement\nthat all relevant decisions be made through the European Convention\nprism might reproduce the state of administrative paralysis that Roscoe\nPound said resulted from the overly dogmatic approach of common\nlaw courts in the 19th century.66 Somewhat paradoxically given the\nhardliners\u2019 opposition towards legal dogmatism, this approach entails\na deeply unattractive jurisprudence that is both highly intrusive and\nhighly formalist. It produces the perverse outcome of wins for rights-\nclaiming applicants even where the rights-based arguments they adduce\nare, as a matter of substance, transparently weak.67\nImposing a general duty on public authorities to couch decisions in\nConvention-friendly terms would have the effect of establishing rights\nand proportionality as the lingua franca of public administration. But\nthis proposal is to be avoided. Public authorities work within a variety\nof structures and frameworks, and through a broad range of dis-\ncourses.68 These multifarious patterns, as Richard Stewart observes,\nresult no doubt from \u201cour tendency to hedge our bets in matters of\ngovernance\u201d.69 Judicial review must respond to \u2013 and match up with \u2013 a\npolyglot patchwork of institutions and players, and a multiplicity of\ncontexts and structures. But those who would impose a general duty to\nmake decisions through the European Convention prism call, in effect,\nfor the imposition of a uniform pattern on this complex structure,\n66 R. Pound, The Spirit of the Common Law (Boston 1921), 56.\n67 Proceduralist decisions of this sort might also lead to confusion among both administrators\nand the broader public. The Court of Appeal decision in Denbigh was widely misperceived as being\nabout substantive violations of rights. See, e.g., \u201cMuslim pupil wins religious dress ruling\u201d,\nThe Guardian, March 2, 2005; \u201cSchool girl wins right to wear Muslim gown\u201d, The Telegraph,\nMarch 3, 2005.\n68 In a recent attempt at mapping this complex scene, Colin Scott identifies four governance\n\u201cregimes\u201d. Governance through public law derived from the traditional \u201cstate-centric conception of\nregulatory governance\u201d in which control \u201cis often premised upon the use of law to make rules or\nstandards\u201d. Governance through markets and competition is \u201cpremised upon the idea that the\nbehaviour of dispersed buyers and sellers, when aggregated, creates a discipline on all actors in the\nmarket\u201d. Unlike governance through public law, one attraction of markets in public management\nreform is the tendency to remove certain responsibilities from governments. Governance through\nnetworks and communities exploits the capacities of communities to develop social norms and to\npolice them through non-coercive mechanisms. Governance through design refers to the\nconstruction of systems in response to which, when they are operating properly, \u201cthere is\nnothing the object of regulation can do to change the way these modalities are applied.\u201d Scott\u2019s\nthesis is that \u201ceach modality of control (with the exception of the fourth) brings with it an\naccountability template as a more or less spontaneous incidence of the control modality.\u201d See\nC. Scott, \u201cSpontaneous Accountability\u201d, in M. Dowdle (ed.), Public Accountability (Cambridge\n2006).\n69 Richard B. Stewart, \u201cAdministrative Law in the Twenty-First Century\u201d (2003) 78 New York\nUniversity Law Review 437, provides a parallel account in which five distinct models or\napproaches within American administrative law are identified: (1) the common law model; (2) the\ntraditional model; (3) the New Deal model of regulatory management; (4) the Interest\nRepresentation model; (5) analytic (or cost-benefit) management of regulation. He also notes\nthe rise of two new regulatory techniques: government-stakeholder networks (e.g. the OMC within\nthe EU) and economic incentive systems (e.g. carbon trading).\nC.L.J.

To enter this brave new world70 would be to dis-\nplace other generally more pressing and quite legitimate concerns: ef-\nficiency, policy delivery, risk assessment, innovation, redistributive\njustice, fairness to all, and the like. This outcome might suit those who\nshare the u\u00a8ber-liberal dream of realising \u201cin Kantian terms, a republi-\ncan ideal\u201d of government under the moral law.71 (It may also hold some\nbasic appeal to lawyers brought up to prize order and coherence.) But\nthe aim of reducing the polyphony of contemporary public adminis-\ntration to a monodic plainchant set by the judges is misguided.\nOmitting to think and speak in the language of Convention rights\nshould not necessarily be regarded as a sin. To emphasize procedure at\nthe expense of substance is to mistake the nature of Convention rights.72\nIt also ignores the complexities of modern administration.\nWhat is needed is a more ecumenical approach, one less committed\nto a model of public policy and administration in which people (and\nespecially judges) act like moral philosophers, and more cognisant of\nthe role that administrative context plays in judicial review, rights-\nbased or otherwise. One such model is provided by Jerry Mashaw, who\npresents what he calls a prudential approach to the issue of statutory\ninterpretation in the context of American administrative law.\nRecognizing the (frequently ignored) fact that administrative lawyers\ninhabit \u201ca legal world where agencies are of necessity the primary of-\nficial interpreters\u201d of statutes,73 he rejects the view of the world of ad-\nministration as a kind of normative desert. We should work to uncover,\nMashaw says, something that he calls \u201ccivil servants\u2019 values\u201d.\nStatutory interpretation by agencies should be conceived as a legal\npractice in its own right, with its own customs and normative con-\nstraints. This practice perforce operates in that \u201cawkward space\u201d be-\ntween facts and norms;74 and, within this practice, the interpretation of\nstatutes by agencies is best understood as part of agency policy devel-\nopment. \u201cAdministration is not just a question of exercising author-\nitative jurisdiction within a hierarchical system of political and legal\naccountability.\u201d75 One consequence of this perspective is to shift un-\nderstandings of what \u201claw\u201d means in this context.

This is entirely appropriate, he\ncontinues, since agencies \u201chave a direct relationship with Congress that\ngives them insights into legislative purposes and meaning that are likely\nto be much more sure-footed than those available to courts in episodic\nlitigation\u201d.77\nThe prudential approach offers a model of the relationship between\ncourt and administration that recognizes the fundamentally ancillary\nor \u201cde-centred\u201d nature of judicial review78 and is, as such, useful for our\npurposes. The reality of interpreting and applying law within the ad-\nministrative context is that it is public authorities themselves who are\nthe principal actors. Judicial review can only ever be \u201csporadic and\nperipheral\u201d to a greater or lesser degree, as countless empirical studies\npast, present and (no doubt) future attest.79 Instead of concluding from\nthis that judicial review is therefore somehow otiose or illegitimate \u2013\nthe response of John Griffith perhaps,80 or of critical legal scholars like\nAlan Hutchinson81 \u2013 the prudential approach sets out a framework in\nwhich we can make sense of this peripheral status. Far from diminish-\ning judicial review, the prudential approach allows us to make sense of\nits particular strengths. Courts have a distinctive legitimacy when it\ncomes to dealing with not only rights but also such issues as relevance,\nproper purpose, rationality and procedural fairness. By policing such\nmatters when they arise in litigation, courts may help to produce an\nadministrative environment in which it is easier to ensure that public\nbodies act lawfully and, incidentally, better respect rights and other\ncognate interests.\nThe sensitivity to primary actors (agencies\/public authorities) that\ncharacterises the prudential approach gives rise to the idea that it is\npart of the court\u2019s task in the administrative law context to establish a\nsystem of incentives for responsible administrative behaviour (by pro-\nviding disincentives for \u201cbad\u201d). It does not assume, as some might, that\npublic authorities operate in a kind of normative vacuum. (Nor, for\nthat matter, a legal vacuum, since the prudential model recognizes that\n76 Ibid., 520 (quoting E.

Lest this approach seem too unrelated to the English context, recall that the court in\nKruse v.

It suggests that the courts have an important role in reinfor-\ncing and upholding the responsibilities that public authorities have for\nthe interpretation and application of law. Certainly, the process of\nstatutory interpretation by public authorities is in the worst instances\nopen to manipulation and abuse, and these should rightly be corrected\nby courts. And, although the prudential model does not speak directly\nabout judicial review where rights are at stake, there is no reason why it\nshould not have application in that context. Indeed, if its basic elements\nand operating assumptions are correct then how can it be otherwise? If\nit is true that public authorities have primary responsibility for inter-\npreting law, then there is no reason that the law relating to human\nrights should fall outside this purview. If it is true that the central task\nof the court in the normal instance is to reinforce and police this re-\nsponsibility, then why should it be fundamentally different where rights\nare concerned? Rights change everything, then, but in another sense\nthey change nothing.\nProblem 2: The \u201cSin\u201d of Commission?\nThe second question is, in a sense, the opposite of the first. It asks how\ncourts should respond when a public authority consciously and ex-\nplicitly comes to a conclusion about rights and proportionality. When a\npublic authority has examined and reached a decision at least partly\nthrough a consideration of its impact on rights, the reviewing court is\nfaced with a choice: either it can ignore the authority\u2019s own assessment\nof rights and proportionality, or it can give some \u2013 at least pro-\nvisional \u2013 weight to that assessment.\nThis issue \u2013 which I will call the (putative) sin of commission \u2013 has\nalso received attention in the cases. Much of the discussion to date has\nbeen conducted in the language of deference.82 The most elaborate\nanalysis of this sort was Laws L.J.\u2019s painstaking attempt in\nInternational Transport Roth to delineate general principles of defer-\nence, referred to in the previous section.83 The House of Lords has\ngenerally been more reticent. Lord Hoffmann, while noting the \u201ccur-\nrent popularity of the word \u2018deference\u2019 to describe the relationship be-\ntween courts and other political bodies\u201d, did not think that \u201cits\novertones of servility, or perhaps gracious concession, are appropriate\nto describe what is happening\u201d.84 These comments are echoed in the\n82 See, e.g., R v.

Secretary of State for the\nHome Department, where the weighing of various factors was said to be\nnot \u201captly described as deference\u201d but rather the \u201cperformance of the\nordinary judicial task of weighing up the competing considerations on\neach side and according appropriate weight to the judgment of a person\nwith responsibility for a given subject matter and access to special\nsources of knowledge and advice\u201d.85\nBut remarks of this sort only scratch the surface of the \u201csin of com-\nmission\u201d question, since they relate more to questions of semantics\nthan substance. (The position adopted by the House of Lords to the\nrelevant authorities in its decisions in Rehman or Gillan, for instance,\ncan only plausibly be described by the word \u201cdeference\u201d or a close\nsynonym.86) The issue was explored in Belfast City Council v. Miss\nBehavin\u2019 Limited, which involved a challenge to the Council\u2019s decision\nto prevent the claimants from opening a sex shop in an area of Belfast.\nThe argument that the decision violated the claimants\u2019 Article 10 right\nto free expression was swiftly rejected.87 The House was divided, how-\never, on the separate question of what weight should be accorded to the\nviews of public authorities involved in making decisions which are\nalleged to infringe Convention rights. On one side, Lord Hoffmann\nsought to extend the scope of the post-Denbigh orthodoxy:\nA construction of the Human Rights Act which requires ordinary\ncitizens in local government to produce such formulaic incan-\ntations would make it ridiculous. Either the refusal infringed the\nrespondent\u2019s Convention rights or it did not. If it did, no display of\nhuman rights learning by the Belfast City Council would have\nmade the decision lawful. If it did not, it would not matter if the\ncouncillors had never heard of article 10 or the First Protocol.88\nOther members of the court adopted a different approach. Baroness\nHale said that the court is \u201cbound to acknowledge\u201d that the local\nauthority is better placed to decide whether the right (in this case) to sell\npornography should be restricted. But the respect that was due the\nauthority depended on the way it had approached that question:\nThe views of the local authority are bound to carry less weight\nwhere the local authority has made no attempt to address that\n85 Huang v.

Had the Belfast City Council expressly set itself the task\nof balancing the rights of individuals to sell and buy pornographic\nliterature and images against the interests of the wider community,\na court would find it hard to upset the balance which the local\nauthority had struck.89\nLord Neuberger agreed with Baroness Hale. When reaching a licensing\ndecision of this sort, a local authority \u201cwould be well advised\u201d, he said,\nto take the right to freedom of expression into account. While such an\nassessment \u201ccannot be conclusive\u201d, \u201cit seems to me consistent with\nwhat Lord Bingham and Lord Hoffmann said in Denbigh \u2026 that\nwhere a council has properly considered the issue in relation to a par-\nticular application, the court is inherently less likely to conclude that\nthe decision ultimately infringes the applicant\u2019s rights.\u201d90\nWe are presented, then, with a choice. One approach \u2013 represented\nby Lord Hoffmann in Miss Behavin\u2019 \u2013 regards the assessment by a\npublic authority of rights and proportionality with complete indiffer-\nence, since the decision as to whether a Convention right is infringed is\nexclusively a matter for the court. The other \u2013 articulated most clearly\nby Baroness Hale in the same case \u2013 argues that the general approach\nof the court should be to show some measure of regard or respect for\nthe way in which an authority handled rights-based concerns.\nLord Hoffmann\u2019s approach does have a certain appeal. It starts from\nthe observation that, for the HRA to have real legal purchase, it must\nbe up to the courts to make authoritative determinations as to what\nConvention rights require. (Save perhaps (a) in relation to declarations\nof incompatibility under s.4 of the Act, where it is clear that, formally\nspeaking at least, Parliament (or the government?) has the final say and\n(b) subject to what the ECtHR might have to say about such determi-\nnations.) This point is surely correct \u2013 the HRA aims after all (and inter\nalia91) to increase judicial protection of ECHR rights. It follows that no\nassessment of what Convention rights require of a public authority\nby the authority itself can be determinative. (This, one might say, is\nthe closest the HRA gets to having its own \u201cMarbury v. Madison\nmoment\u201d.92) This being so, Lord Hoffmann continues, it must be for\nthe courts to decide in all cases what Convention rights require and so\nany determination by a public authority of the rights issues at stake is\nstrictly speaking irrelevant to the judicial construction of the ECHR or\nthe HRA.\nIt is the last stage of the argument which is, I think, overstated. To\nsee why, we need to return to Baroness Hale\u2019s approach to find out\n89 Ibid., at [37].\n90 Ibid., at [91].\n91 See, e.g., Gearty, Principles of Human Rights Adjudication, above note 15.\n92 Marbury v.

This approach, which seeks to allow\nsome accommodation of public authorities\u2019 determination of rights\nin judicial calculations, incorporates something akin to the Chevron\n\u201cdue deference\u201d doctrine that operates in American administrative\nlaw.93 Chevron gave an authoritative answer to the question: should\ncourts decide questions of statutory interpretation on their own, or\nshould they give some weight to the views of the relevant agency?\nThe case established a two-step inquiry.94 Under step one, the question\nis whether Congress has \u201cdirectly decided the precise question at\nissue\u201d, or whether Congress has unambiguously banned what the\nagency proposes to do. Under step two, courts ask whether the\nagency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is reasonable. The result, ac-\ncording to a leading commentator, \u201cis that under Chevron, agency in-\nterpretations of law should be upheld if they are reasonable and if they\ndo not contradict the clear instructions of Congress. The court is not\nauthorized to reject the agency\u2019s interpretation merely because the\ncourt disagrees, all things considered, about how the statute should be\ninterpreted.\u201d95\nSimilar doctrines apply, in one form or another,96 in many (perhaps\nmost) jurisdictions.97 The decision to focus here on Chevron is due\npartly to the doctrine\u2019s familiarity and also because it has been the\nsubject of considerable academic discussion.98 The analogy is not in-\ntended to be exact \u2013 Chevron applies to the interpretation of federal\nstatutes by agencies, whereas our focus is the application of ECHR\nrights by public authorities. But it is instructive for our purposes.\n93 Chevron USA Inc v.

Mead 533 US 211 (2001).\n94 But see M. Stephenson and A.

Cf. Cass R. Sunstein, \u201cLaw and Administration\nafter Chevron\u201d (1990) 90 Columbia Law Review 969, which regards Chevron as a \u201ccounter-\nMarbury principle\u201d.\nC.L.J. English Administrative Law 161\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nThe Chevron approach is based on the proposition that agencies are\ntypically in a better position than are courts to assess the relevant\nconsiderations. The doctrine responds, then, to the complexity of ad-\nministrative decision-making and recognises that statutory interpret-\nation is part of the policy-making task. It operates (or is meant to\noperate99) as a remedy for the \u201cinstitutional blindness\u201d100 that can\notherwise beset judicial review to the detriment of public adminis-\ntration. Significantly, it also reinforces what might be called the exist-\ning chain of responsibility from Congress to agency (and back). As\nMashaw observes, Chevron recognizes (and emphasizes) the \u201cconver-\ngence of interpretation and policy making that both counsels judicial\ncaution and establishes administrative responsibility\u201d.101\nIs there an argument that judges should apply something like a\nChevron test in the application of ECHR rights? Some would certainly\nthink not. They would say that Baroness Hale\u2019s approach would neuter\nthe rights-based structure of \u201creformation\u201d judicial review, since it\nwould amount, in Allan\u2019s memorable phrase, to a doctrine of \u201cnon-\njusticiability dressed in pastel colours\u201d.102 It would allow the court to\nrenege on its duty to delineate the contours of the new administrative\nlaw. But before deciding to cast one\u2019s lot with Hoffmann and the\nhardliners, consider that the point of Chevron is not only to counsel\njudicial caution when dealing with agency interpretations of statutes. It\nis also designed to establish agency responsibility for such determi-\nnations. In the English context, if we assume that the courts settle the\nprevious (\u201csin of omission\u201d) question by deciding not to impose a\ngeneral duty on authorities to take decisions through the Convention\nprism \u2013 a reasonable assumption given the state of the authorities \u2013\nthen the non-deferential \u201cHoffmann approach\u201d in fact breaks this\nchain of responsibility. If an authority\u2019s own assessment of rights has\nno bearing in a case of judicial review, then the authority is equally\ndamned whether it approaches a decision in rights-related terms or\nwhether it does not. It certainly would have no court-mandated in-\ncentive to think and act openly in a manner compatible with rights.\nIf the underlying goal is to encourage an administrative culture that\nrespects rights, then this approach may ultimately prove counter-\nproductive.\nThe alternative solution allows courts to attach presumptive weight\nto an authority\u2019s calculations about rights and rejects the top-down,\n99 For an empirical investigation into the application of the Chevron doctrine see T.J.

It\naccepts that when making a proportionality assessment a complete\nabsence of any consideration by the authority of whether it went too far\nin relation to the right(s) at stake makes it harder to argue that the\nimpugned decision was proportionate. But it insists that the converse\nshould also be true. Where the authority can show that it approached\nthe question cognisant of the rights at stake and sought to balance\nthose rights against legitimate public interests, then the court should be\nslower to rule that the authority acted outside its discretionary area of\njudgement. (Note that this approach does not by any means preclude a\nhardening of the standard of review in suitable cases \u2013 say, in reviewing\nthe application of counter-terrorism laws.103 There will be instances \u2013\nno doubt many \u2013 when the authority\u2019s own assessment of the rights\ninterests at stake will be judged inadequate by the court. As Martin\nShapiro points out, courts often run two seemingly conflicting lines of\nauthority, one asserting that the court has the final say on what law\nmeans and the other deferring to agency interpretation.104) The ap-\nproach being defended here does not require authorities to work with\n\u201ctextbooks on human rights law at their elbows\u201d.105 Nor does it insist\nthat all public authorities must learn to parrot the language of human\nrights law. But it does try to give credit where an authority has thought\nseriously about the important interests at stake \u2013 and tries not to be too\ndogmatic about whether such consideration deploys the language of\nECHR rights and proportionality directly, or whether it does so in\nmore general, less lawyerly terms.\nArguments in favour of this approach have tended to take the form\nof an appeal to administrative complexity. Jowell argues, as we have\nseen, in favour of giving deference where questions of what he calls\n\u201cinstitutional competence\u201d arise: that is, where the public authority, for\nreasons of capacity or expertise, is better placed than the court to\nconsider the issues at stake.106 But perhaps the best argument in its\nfavour is more pragmatic and relates to the objectives of the HRA. For\nBaroness Hale\u2019s approach gives authorities a direct incentive to think\nin terms of human rights, since decisions are less likely to be struck\n103 See, e.g., T. Poole, \u201cCourts and Conditions of Uncertainty in \u2018Times of Crisis\u2019\u201d [2008] P.L. 234.\n104 M. Shapiro, \u201cTrans Atlantic: Harlow Revisited\u201d in Craig and Rawlings, Law and Administration\nin Europe, above note 13, 236. \u201cIt can hardly be otherwise. No court that takes judicial review, or\nmore broadly the judicial function itself, seriously, can give up its authority decisively to decide\nquestions of law. To allow an agency exercising delegated rule-making powers to be the sole and\nfinal interpreter of the delegating statute would render every such delegation unlimited until\nrecalled. On the other hand, no court engaged in administrative review can deny that the agency\nto which rule-making authority is delegated must interpret the statute in order to make rules\nunder it.\u201d\n105 Begum, [2006] UKHL 15 at [68] (per Lord Hoffmann).\n106 See, e.g., R.

Not only would\nthis create a space in which an agency could assume responsibility for\nthe initial translation of rights discourse into the specific administrative\ncontext in which the agency operates. It would also take an agency\u2019s\nassessment of rights and proportionality seriously, thereby opening up\nthe possibility of some sort of exchange on human rights matters be-\ntween courts and administrators,107 an unlikely prospect if the top-\ndown model is preferred. The alternative approach should be favoured,\nthen, because it represents the best route towards inculcating a plaus-\nible rights-respecting culture within the structures and pathways of\nadministration. While some might mourn the loss of juridical control\nthat is inherent to this solution, the watering down of legal control\nshould be seen as the price to be paid for securing an administrative\nculture of rights-conscious justification.\nConclusion\nThe terrain of administrative law has often been fought over by those\nwho would see the subject as virtually synonymous with judicial review\nof administrative action and those who would understand it more\nbroadly as the law relating to the administration. One group tends to\nspotlight administrative decision-making by judges, particularly their\nsupervisory jurisdiction. The other observes that much of adminis-\ntrative law is developed and enforced within the administration itself\nand forms a complex system in which the court play an important but\nmarginal role. The first group tends to emphasize individual rights. The\nsecond puts equal weight on public needs (and public wrongs).108 While\nthe embrace of rights by English courts since the HRA might be taken\nby some as a sign of the victory of the first view over the second, it is in\nfact nothing of the sort. What it does mean is that the old disputes need\nto be recast, rethought and played out in a different register.\nIn his work on speculative ontology, Alain Badiou suggests that his\nsubject pivots between the poles of Unity and Totality. \u201cIt has been so\nfrom the very beginning of metaphysics, since it is possible to show that\nPlato essentially has the One prevail over the All, whilst Aristotle made\nthe opposite choice.\u201d109 Perhaps a similar opposition prevails in the\ndiscipline of administrative law. One side \u2013 the \u201cPlatonists\u201d \u2013 sees the\nnew order of public law as the primary site of the progression towards\nthe fulfilment of the Idea of the Rule of Law. In this vision, the \u201cone\nLaw\u201d is essentially the law of rights and is understood as being\n107 On the impact of the HRA see, e.g., S. Halliday and P.

By contrast, the \u201cAristotelians\u201d tend to be more\nempirical than Idealist, their goal being to capture and make sense of\nthe totality of the social world of which administrative law forms a\npart. This perspective inclines them to see the court as but one insti-\ntution amongst many \u2013 albeit one with particular powers and auth-\nority \u2013 and rights as one normative priority \u2013 albeit an important and\ndistinctive one \u2013 amongst many. This is the vision of Totality. No\ndoubt this is a harder vision to capture and express, since it requires the\ncommentator to work through a complicated and shifting relationship\nbetween courts and the world of administration in which the courts\n(and even law) cannot always be primary.\nThis article offers an argument which, while recognising that ju-\ndicial review is changing quite profoundly, denies that these changes\namount to the introduction of a straightforward hierarchical relation-\nship in which courts control the administration in the name of pro-\ntecting the Law that relates to rights. It rejects Unity, then, in the name\nof Totality, offering instead a conception of judicial review in which\nrights and proportionality play important roles but which also rec-\nognizes the ancillary or de-centred nature of that system.111 It suggests\nthat, inasmuch as the \u201cframers\u201d of the HRA intended the Act to create\nsome sort of \u201cculture of rights\u201d among public authorities,112 this ob-\njective cannot be realised through a model which calls for an austere\nconstruction of rights denuded, as it were, of the administrative and\nnormative context in which they play out \u2013 a model which enjoins\njudges to regard issues and interests exterior to rights as \u201cexterior\u201d and\ntherefore irrelevant. Such a rigid approach may indeed sometimes be\nrequired, particularly where Convention rights that allow for no\nqualification are in play. But these instances will be relatively rare.\nMore often than not, judicial calculations about rights will also involve\n110 See, e.g., Allan, Constitutional Justice, above note 15.\n111 In doing so, I adopt a broad conception of administrative law as the body of law which\n\u201cestablishes both primary rules governing how the administration is authorized to work (its\norganization, powers, and procedures), as well as the secondary rules governing remedies (judicial\nand other) available in cases of a failure to observe the primary rules.\u201d (J.S. Bell, \u201cComparative\nAdministrative Law\u201d in M. Reimann and R. Zimmermann (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of\nComparative Law (Oxford 2006), 1261.) See also, e.g., R.A. Stewart, \u201cAdministrative Law in the\nTwenty-First Century\u201d (2003) 78 New York University Law Review 437, 438: \u201cIn liberal\ndemocratic societies, administrative regulation is itself regulated by administrative law. This law\ndefines the structural position of administrative agencies within the governmental system, specifies\nthe decisional procedures those agencies must follow, and determines the availability and scope of\nreview of their actions by the independent judiciary. It furnishes common principles and\nprocedures that cut horizontally across the many different substantive fields of administration and\nregulation.\u201d\n112 See, e.g., C.

And this\nprocess entails, or so I have suggested, the establishment of a structure\nin which the responsibilities that public authorities have in relation to\nrights are reinforced by the courts. This does not necessarily amount to\na counsel of caution. It is perfectly consistent with the vigorously en-\nforcing of Convention rights by courts in appropriate cases.\nMore specifically, the article has examined two questions, the an-\nswers to which will help determine the shape of the emerging system of\njudicial review. The first question asks whether a public authority\u2019s\nsilence on the question of rights at the decision-making stage should\nitself count as a breach of the HRA-imposed duty not to infringe\nConvention rights. Some might be tempted to answer this question in\nthe affirmative \u2013 certainly that was the approach of the Court of\nAppeal in Denbigh. Such an approach might find support in the the-\nories presented by writers such as Allan and Beatty, who advocate a\nconception of constitutional politics in which the court is the central\nagent within a culture of rights-based justification. A public authority\u2019s\nsilence on the question of rights might, from this perspective, be re-\ngarded as a failure to do what a good decision-maker is now required to\ndo: namely, to articulate its decisions through a framework of\nConvention rights. I have argued that the House of Lords were right\nto reject this approach in Denbigh. Not only would the other approach\nlead to a formalist and proceduralist jurisprudence, it also fails to\npay sufficient regard to the diversity of contemporary governance\nstructures.\nThe second question asks whether the court should give provisional\nweight to an authority\u2019s own assessment of the rights issues at stake.\nThis question divided the House of Lords in Miss Behavin\u2019. Lord\nHoffmann argued that no weight should be given to an authority\u2019s\n\u201cincantations\u201d of human rights: \u201cno display of human rights learning\u201d\non the authority\u2019s part can make no difference to whether or not its\ndecision infringed the Convention. By contrast, Baroness Hale and\nLord Neuberger thought that where an authority has considered the\nhuman rights implications of its decision, then the court is \u201cinherently\nless likely to conclude that the decision ultimately infringes\u201d\nConvention rights. The line charted by Lord Hoffmann is more likely\nto find favour with hardline advocates of rights-based public law.\nAllan, for instance, argues that deference is tantamount to reneging on\nthe judicial task of articulating the nature and limits of the new con-\nstitutional order. Non-rights related considerations are, for him, not\nproperly matters for the court. This court-centred approach to creating\na rights-based culture is ultimately self-defeating since, were it consist-\nently applied, there would be no (legal) incentive for public authorities\nto examine decisions through a \u201cEuropean Convention prism\u201d.\n166 The Cambridge Law Journal [2009]\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nBaroness Hale\u2019s approach is preferable precisely because it provides\nsuch an incentive. Her solution also allows greater scope for public\nauthorities to internalise human rights discourse within their own\nstructures, and opens up the possibility of productive dialogue between\ncourts and administrators on human rights matters.\nUnderneath these responses lie not only two different visions of\nrights in administrative law, but also two different visions of the role of\nrights in contemporary structures of governance. Both recognise that\nthe discipline is undergoing profound change \u2013 the \u201cnormative turn\u201d\nidentified by Dyzenhaus.113 But the hardliners present a vision of ad-\nministrative law that has been effectively assimilated by human rights,\nwhile the other approach articulates a conception of administrative law\nthat seeks to accommodate rights and the doctrines that relate to them\nwithin a wider conception of administrative justice. These different\nperspectives generate different understandings of the basic elements of\nthe new order. While some hardliners might re-imagine due process\nrequirements as centring on the duty to articulate one\u2019s decisions in\nrights-based terms, the alternative approach rejects such a course, ar-\nguing that the judicial assessment of procedural requirements remains\ninescapably contextual, and may or may not involve rights. And while\nhardliners tend to stigmatise considerations other than rights as exter-\nnal to judicial decision-making, the alternative approach insists that\n(even in cases involving rights) the immediate political and adminis-\ntrative context surrounding impugned decisions remains vital for ju-\ndicial consideration.114 More significantly, these two models also tell\ndifferent stories about the process of juridification that necessarily ac-\ncompanies the introduction of legally enforceable human rights.115 For\nthe hardliners, the court stands at the heart of a system of rights-based\nconstitutional politics and any public authority can in principle be\ncalled before the court to give an account of its decision-making in\nterms relating to the rule of law, understood in its \u201cthick\u201d or value-\nladen sense. From this hub, principles of legality and equality are ex-\npected to radiate outwards (or downwards) across the range of public\nadministration. Objecting to a court-dominated model that would turn\nthe age of rights into an \u201cera of scholasticism\u201d116 in which public ad-\nministrators are obliged to work their way through a legalistic maze,\nadvocates of the other approach tend to be more empirical in outlook\nand ecumenical in attitude. They suggest, that is to say, that the starting\n113 D. Dyzenhaus, \u201cThe Politics of the Question of Constituent Power\u201d in M. Loughlin and\nN.
