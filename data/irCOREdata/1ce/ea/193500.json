In the cerebellum, excitatory\nafferent information frommossy fibers is transmitted via granule\ncells (GCs) to Purkinje cells (PCs). GC axons ascend into the\nmolecular layer of the cortex, where they bifurcate to form par-\nallel fibers (PFs), which extend for several millimeters in either\ndirection, forming one or atmost two synapses with a large num-\nber of PCs (Napper and Harvey, 1988). This characteristic archi-\ntecture has formed the basis for models of cerebellar function in\nwhich information is thought to be readily disseminated across\nthe cortex along beams of parallel fibers. Evidence that informa-\ntion is reliably transmitted along the entire length of parallel fi-\nbers to PCs is, however, controversial. Whereas direct parallel\nfiber activation can spread some distance along fibers (Garwicz\nand Andersson, 1992; Vranesic et al., 1994; Heck, 1995), mossy\nfiber stimulation activates only patches of PCs directly above the\nmossy fiber termination zone (Eccles et al., 1972; Bower and\nWoolston, 1983; Cohen and Yarom, 1998) with little evidence of\nsynchronous parallel fiber activation (Jaeger, 2003). These obser-\nvations have revitalized a hypothesis inwhich synapses formed by\nthe ascending segment of the GC axon, which represent 20% of the\ntotal GC input to PCs (Gundappa-Sulur et al., 1999), provide the\nprincipal excitatory drive to the cerebellar cortex (Llina\u00b4s, 1982;\nSantamaria et al., 2002). Ascending axon synapses release trans-\nmitter with a higher mean probability than those formed by par-\nallel fibers and display larger postsynaptic responses to quantal\nrelease events (Sims andHartell, 2005). Furthermore, whereas up\nto 85% of synapses formed by parallel fibers appear to be electri-\ncally silent, this proportion is much reduced at ascending axon\nsynapses (Isope and Barbour, 2002). These synaptic specializa-\ntions confer each segment of the granule cell axon with funda-\nmentally different transmission characteristics and suggest that\nthey serve functionally different roles in cerebellar processing. To\ntest the hypothesis that parallel fibers play a more modulatory\nrole in cerebellar information flow whereas ascending axons are\n\u201chard-wired,\u201d we have compared the extent to which synapses\nformed by each axonal segment undergo various forms of plas-\nticity associated with motor learning.\nMaterials andMethods\nSlice preparation.Coronal, cerebellar slices (250\u0001mthick) were obtained\nfrom the vermis of 14- to 21-d-old, male Wistar rats, using a cutting\nsolution consisting of the following (in mM): 250 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 26\nNaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2\u00012H2O, 1 MgCl2\u00016H20, 10 glucose.\nSlices were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in artificial CSF\n(aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 2.5\nCaCl2\u00012H2O, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4\u00017H2O, and 11 glu-\ncose, equilibrated with 95% O2\u20135% CO2 to pH 7.4. Picrotoxin (20 \u0001M)\nwas present in the aCSF to block transmission via GABAA receptors.\nElectrophysiology. Slices were transferred to a chamber on an upright\nmicroscope and perfused with aCSF at a rate of 1.5\u20132 ml min\u00011 at room\ntemperature. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from the\nsomata of PCs 20\u2013100 \u0001m below the surface of the slice. For recording,\npatch electrodes (3\u20135 M\u0002) were filled with solutions containing the\nfollowing (in mM): 132 K-gluconate, 8 NaCl, 2 MgCl2\u00016H2O, 30 HEPES,\n4 Na2ATP, 0.3 GTP, and 0.5 EGTA or 0.5 BAPTA. In some cases, the\nconcentration of BAPTA was raised to 10 mM to reduce the likelihood of\nconcurrent postsynaptic long-term depression (LTD) induction.

Par-\nallel fiber synapses were activated by stimulating through aCSF-filled\npatch electrodes, with resistances of 1\u20132M\u0002, placedmidway between the\nPC layer and pia mater to a depth of 50\u2013100 \u0001m, 150\u2013300 \u0001m lateral to\nthe recorded PC. This input will subsequently be referred to as the par-\nallel fiber pathway. Ascending axon synapses were activated with elec-\ntrodes placed in the GC layer, 30\u2013100 \u0001m directly behind the PC soma.\nAscending axons make \u000330 synaptic contacts before forming parallel\nfibers (Pitchitpornchai et al., 1994). Because parallel fibers make on av-\nerage only one or at most two synapses with a single PC (Harvey and\nNapper, 1991), then in this configuration, the likelihood of activating\nparallel fiber synapses is small. Although unlikely, we cannot rule out,\nhowever, a potential contribution from synapses formed by the parallel\nfiber very close to the point of bifurcation.With this caveat, this inputwill\nsubsequently be referred to as the ascending axon pathway. To test\nwhether a difference in the density of synapse activation by ascending\naxon and parallel fiber pathways might influence the induction of plas-\nticity, a series of experiments was performed in which a stimulation\nelectrode was placed in the GC layer, 150\u2013300\u0001m lateral to the recorded\nPC at least 50 \u0001m from the PC layer. In this configuration, because\nascending axons rise to different levels within the molecular layer, GC\nactivation produces a more dispersed activation of synapses to the re-\ncorded PC. Placement here also eliminates any possibility of retrograde\nactivation of ascending axon segment synapses. In all experiments, base-\nline stimulus intensities were carefully adjusted to elicit relatively small\nsynaptic currents to ensure the specificity of synaptic input pathway and\nto standardize, as closely as possible, the number of contributing syn-\napses in each pathway. Stimulation strengths did not exceed 20 V and\nwere applied for 100 \u0001s.\nWhole-cell recordingsweremadewith anAxopatch 200B; signals were\nfiltered at 5 kHz (8-pole Bessel filter) and digitized at 10 kHz. In all\nexperiments, series resistances (5\u201320 M\u0002) were compensated (\u000475%)\nand monitored throughout. Experiments were terminated if series resis-\ntance, input resistance, or holding current changed significantly during\nthe experiment. Data were collected using \u201cThe LTP program\u201d (Ander-\nson and Collingridge, 1999).\nThe effects of five different protocols previously reported to produce\neither long-term potentiation (LTP) or LTD were compared at parallel\nfiber and ascending axon pathways. In all cases, a 10 min period of\nbaseline stimulationwas initially applied duringwhich pairs of pulses (50\nms interval) were delivered alternately to parallel fiber and ascending\naxon pathways at a rate of 0.1 or 0.2 Hz. Two forms of long-term depres-\nsion were examined. Because LTD requires the postsynaptic elevation of\ncalcium, an intracellular solution containing 0.5mM EGTAwas used and\ninduction protocols were performed in current-clamp mode. For con-\njunctive LTD (LTDCJ), cells were held between \u000165 and \u000170 mV and\none of the pathways was stimulated five times at 100Hz, followed 100ms\nlater by stimulation of the climbing fiber (CF) input. This protocol was\nrepeated 50 times at 2 s intervals. To test for CF-independent LTD, the\nintensity of stimulation to one pathway was raised to elicit EPSPs \u000410\nmV and the frequency of stimulation raised to 1 Hz for 5 min (Hartell,\n1996). Care was taken to avoid PC spiking. Stimulation parameters to the\nother pathway were unaltered. After the induction period, cells were\nreturned to voltage-clamp mode. During the induction of LTD, the\nmembrane resistance often decreased transiently but recovered to base-\nline levels over the subsequent 5\u201310min. Experiments were abandoned if\nthe membrane resistance did not recover. Transient decreases in mem-\nbrane resistance led to apparent differences in the onset rate of depres-\nsion (for example, compare Figs. 1b, 5b). Statistical comparisons were\ntherefore only made when the membrane resistance had fully recovered.\nThree protocols reported to produce long-term potentiation were also\nexamined. To induce LTP of postsynaptic origin (LTPPOST), 300 pulses\nwere applied to one pathway at a rate of 1 Hz. The other pathway was left\nunstimulated during this period. To induce LTP of presynaptic origin\n(LTPPRE), the frequency of stimulation to one pathway was raised to 16\nHz for 15 s; the other pathway was not stimulated during this time.\nFinally, the effects of a 10 min application of the protein kinase A (PKA)\nactivator forskolin, which is also thought to produce LTP through pre-\nsynaptic actions, were also examined (LTPFORSK). Stimulation condi-\ntions to either pathway were unaltered during applications. After all five\nprotocols, baseline rates of stimulation were resumed for at least 30 min.\nData analysis. Additional analysis was performed using customized\nprocedures in IgorPro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The\nmeans of six consecutive sweeps per pathway were calculated every 30 s,\nand data were expressed as percentages of mean baseline levels. Paired-\npulse ratios were calculated as the mean of the second of paired pulses\ndivided by themean of the first to reduce inaccuracies caused by random\nfluctuation (Kim and Alger, 2001). To confirm the location of each type\nof synaptic plasticity, a form of coefficient of variation (CV) analysis was\nused (Bekkers and Stevens, 1990). This analysis allows an assessment of\nwhether changes in response amplitude result from a change in the prob-\nability of release (P), the number of contributing transmitter release sites\n(N), or the postsynaptic quantal amplitude (Q). The mean amplitude\nand the reciprocal of the square of the coefficient of variation (CV\u00012) of\n30\u201350 individual responses, sampled during a period of stable baseline\nrecording conditions and 20\u201330min after each plasticity-induction pro-\ntocol, were calculated. The ratios of the second to the first values were\ncalculated to obtain a value relative to baseline conditions, and normal-\nized values of CV\u00012 were plotted against normalized amplitude. The\nmean amplitude of EPSCs represents the product ofN, P, andQ (NPQ).\nCV\u00012 is proportional toNP\/1\u0001 P. Therefore, a change inQ is indepen-\ndent of CV\u00012, whereas a change in N will be directly proportional to\namplitude and CV\u00012. The Mann\u2013WhitneyU test was used for statistical\nanalysis between independent sample groups, and the Wilcoxon signed\nranks test was used to compare differences between pathways to the same\ncell. Unless stated otherwise, all compounds were obtained from Sigma\n(St. Louis, MO).\nResults\nSeveral presynaptic and postsynaptic forms of long-term plastic-\nity have been described at GC\u2013PC synapses that could help to\nestablish ormaintain specialization of granule cell axon synapses.\nHowever, because no distinction between ascending and parallel\nfiber synapses has previously been made, the relative susceptibil-\nities of each of these segments to cerebellar plasticity are not\nknown. We set out, therefore, to establish whether synapses\nformed by the two segments of the granule cell axon were differ-\nentially susceptible to each of the forms of plasticity so far de-\nscribed between GCs and PCs.\nLong-term depression at ascending axon and parallel\nfiber synapses\nCerebellar LTD is thought to result from the downregulation\nof postsynaptic AMPA receptors (Wang and Linden, 2000).\nBecause this would effectively reduce the mean quantal ampli-\ntude and because parallel fiber synapses have lower mean\nquantal amplitudes than those formed by ascending axons\n(Sims and Hartell, 2005), we compared the extent to which\neach synaptic pathway to single PCs underwent two well char-\nacterized forms of LTD. Combining CF activation with paral-\nlel fiber stimulation, using a protocol designed to replicate\nphysiological patterns of GC and climbing fiber activity (LT-\nDCJ), produced LTD of parallel fiber pathway EPSCs but not\nascending axon responses. No depression was observed in ei-\nther pathway when the CF was activated in association with\nascending axon inputs (Fig. 1b,c; Table 1). Ascending axon\nsynapses are generally formed on smaller diameter, more distally\nsituated dendrites (Gundappa-Sulur et al., 1999). In the event\nthat their position places them outside the influence of the CF-\nmediated calcium transient, one of the requisite elements for\nLTD, we also tested the efficacy of another form of LTD that does\n5154 \u2022 J. Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):5153\u20135159 Sims and Hartell \u2022 Ascending Axon Synapses Are Resistant to Plasticity\nnot require simultaneous CF activation (Hartell, 1996), referred\nto here as CF-independent LTD (Fig. 1d,e) (for details, see Mate-\nrials andMethods). In this model, intracellular calcium levels are\nraised by increasing the strength of stimulation to the GC input\nfor the period of induction. Application of this protocol to the\nparallel fiber pathway led to a selective depression of parallel fiber\nresponses compared with time-matched control experiments in\nwhich both pathways were activated alternately at baseline rates\nand stimulus intensities throughout. No depression of ascending\naxon pathway responses was observed. Paired-pulse ratios did\nnot change significantly in either pathway. When the induction\nprotocol was applied to the ascending axon pathway, ascending\naxon synaptic responses initially increased slightly in amplitude\nbut then returned to baseline levels. A small depression emerged\nafter 30 min, but this was not significantly different from control\ndata. No depression of parallel fiber responses was observed un-\nder these conditions.\nWe next undertook an analysis of response variability before\nand after CF-independent LTD induction to help establish the\nsite of origin of any long-term changes in synaptic strength. Sur-\nprisingly, because LTD is thought to be a postsynaptic process,\nCF-independent depression at the parallel fiber pathway was ac-\ncompanied by a small increase in response variability, seen as a\nreduction in CV\u00012 values. We therefore examined the synaptic\nvariability of our control data where ascending axon and parallel\nfiber pathways were activated at baseline intensities and rates for\n30\u201340min. As seen in Figure 1f, similar decreases inCV\u00012 values\nwere observed in the absence of synaptic depression, indicating\nthat the increase in variability over time is a feature of prolonged\nrecordings under these experimental conditions rather than syn-\naptic depression itself. Accordingly, when comparedwith control\ndata, we can see that the depression observed at parallel fiber\nsynapses in response to parallel fiber stimulation occurs without\nany relative change in response variability and so reflects a de-\ncrease in quantal amplitude (Q) (i.e., it is of postsynaptic origin).\nPostsynaptic long-term potentiation in ascending axon and\nparallel fiber synapses\nRecently, a variant of LTP has been reported at GC\u2013PC synapses\nthat can be induced by 1 Hz stimulation of GC\u2013PC synapses, at\nbaseline strengths, for 5 min. This LTP is expressed postsynapti-\ncally (Lev-Ram et al., 2002) and is capable of reversing LTD (Lev-\nRam et al., 2003; Coesmans et al., 2004). Because postsynaptic\nLTP could result in an increase inQ, we examined the effects of 1\nHz stimulation to ascending axon and parallel fiber synapses in\nturn. In these experiments, 10 mM BAPTA was included in the\npatch pipette to prevent concurrent LTD expression and the\nbaseline stimulation rate was lowered to 0.1 Hz to reduce run up\nof synaptic responses.\nThe application of 1 Hz stimulation to parallel fiber pathway\ninputs to PCs produced a long-lasting enhancement of parallel\npathway EPSC amplitudes but not ascending axon pathway re-\nsponses, which remained at baseline levels (Fig. 2a). Although\nparallel fiber potentiation was initially accompanied by a tran-\nsient decrease in the paired-pulse ratio, this returned to baseline\nlevels within 15 min. The same stimulus protocol applied to the\nascending axon pathway failed to produce potentiation (Fig. 2b).\nAscending axon EPSC amplitudes remained indistinguishable\nfrom baseline levels or from time-matched control experiments.\nInterestingly, parallel fiber pathway responses, which were not\nevoked during induction of the ascending axon input, showed an\nimmediate depression in five of the seven cells recorded that\nreached 79.3 \u0005 9.8% of baseline levels within 20 min (n \u0006 7).\nFigure 1.

Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):5153\u20135159 \u2022 5155\nThis was unexpected given the lack of any\nform of plasticity at the ascending axon\ninput. The experiments were therefore re-\npeated but stimulation to the parallel fiber\npathway was maintained at baseline rates\nduring 1 Hz stimulation of the ascending\naxon input. Under these conditions, EPSC\namplitudes did not decline (Fig. 2c, Table\n1). Therefore, the lack of synaptic input\nduring ascending axon stimulationwas re-\nsponsible for depression at parallel fiber\nsynapses. CV analysis was also performed\nfor these experiments and compared with\ncontrol data as before (Fig. 2d). This re-\nvealed that the long-term potentiation ob-\nserved in themolecular layer pathway after\n1 Hz stimulation did indeed appear to be\nthe result of an increase inQ, confirming a\npostsynaptic effect. CV analysis suggests\nthat the depression that emerged at paral-\nlel fiber pathways when left unstimulated\nmay have been as a result of a reduction in\nthe number of contributing release sites,\nbecause amplitude decreased proportion-\nally with CV\u00012.\nPresynaptic long-term potentiation in ascending axon and\nparallel fiber synapses\nHigher frequencies of activation (4\u201316 Hz) also produce a form\nof LTP (Shibuki and Okada, 1992; Salin et al., 1996; Jacoby et al.,\n2001) that is accompanied by a change in the paired-pulse ratio,\nsuggesting that it is caused by presynaptic events leading to an\nincrease in release probability.When tested onparallel fiber path-\nway responses, 16 Hz stimulation elicited a potentiation of par-\nallel fiber pathway responses (Fig. 3a). A small increase of ascend-\ning axon pathway responses also emerged but this was not\nsignificant compared with control data. The same protocol ap-\nplied to the ascending axon pathway failed to produce potentia-\ntion in either pathway (Fig. 3b). Parallel fiber potentiation was\naccompanied by a reduction in paired-pulse ratio that was, in line\nwith our previous results (Jacoby et al., 2001), significantly re-\nduced for 10\u201315 min before recovering toward baseline levels\n( p \u0007 0.05). A concurrent decrease in response variability (and\ntherefore an increase in CV\u00012) over this time period further sug-\ngested a presynaptic site of action (Fig. 2c\u2013e). Although not sig-\nnificant, CV analysis suggests that the small potentiation at the\nascending axon pathway after raised frequency stimulation of the\nparallel fiber pathway may be postsynaptic in origin. Neverthe-\nless, as in the case of the other forms of plasticity examined in this\nstudy, these experiments demonstrate that ascending axon inputs\nare less able to sustain plastic changes compared with parallel\nfiber inputs to the same cells.\nPresynaptic LTP is dependent on PKA (Salin et al., 1996; Ja-\ncoby et al., 2001) and can be mimicked by application of the\nadenylate cyclase activator, forskolin.We therefore compared the\neffects of a 10min application of forskolin (10\u0001M) during 0.2 Hz\nalternate stimulation of the ascending axon and parallel fiber\npathway (Fig. 4a). Twenty minutes after application, parallel fi-\nber EPSC amplitudes were initially strongly potentiated. Ascend-\ning axon pathway responses also underwent an increase, but the\npeak level was much smaller and responses returned to baseline\nlevels within 30 min. CV\u00012 analysis demonstrated that potentia-\ntion in both pathways was presynaptic in agreement with previ-\nTable 1.

Because\nthe increases in EPSC amplitudes were directly proportional to\nCV\u00012, this suggests that potentiation occurs through an increase\nin the number of contributing release sites.\nThe influence of synaptic density on plasticity\nIt has recently been suggested that stimulation of beams of par-\nallel fibers causes an unphysiologically compact activation of lo-\ncalized regions of a PC, and through synaptic cross talk, this may\nincrease the level of postsynaptic type 1 metabotropic glutamate\nreceptor (mGluR1) activation and other consequential events in-\ncluding endocannabinoid inhibition of presynaptic glutamate re-\nlease. Activation of mGluRs (Conquet et al., 1994; Hartell, 1994)\nand cannabinoid receptor type 1 are necessary for LTD (Safo and\nRegehr, 2005). We therefore examined the degree to which LTD\nand presynaptic and postsynaptic forms of LTPwere expressed at\nPF synapses activated by stimulation of theGC layer, lateral to the\nrecorded PC (Fig. 5a). Because ascending axons rise to different\nlevels within themolecular layer, lateral GC activation produces a\nmore dispersed activation of synapses to the recorded PC than\ndirect parallel fiber activation. It also eliminates any possibility of\nretrograde activation of ascending axon synapses. For consis-\ntency and to allow proper comparison between experimental\ndata sets, care was taken to ensure that the mean amplitudes of\nsynaptic responses were identical to those produced by ascending\naxon or direct parallel fiber stimulation. Synaptic currents after\nlateral GC layer stimulation of the amplitudes used throughout\nthis study do not produce synaptic cross talk, as evidenced by the\nabsence of a slow, mGluR1-mediated current, even when acti-\nvated at very high frequencies (Marcaggi and Attwell, 2005).\nThe results of these experiments are summarized in Figure 5\nand Table 1. Pairing dispersed PF inputs with CF stimulation\nproduced LTD (Fig. 5b). The level of depression was statistically\nindistinguishable from that resulting from direct PF stimulation.\nSimilarly, 1 Hz raised intensity stimulation of the lateral GC layer\nalso produced clear LTD. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic\nmodes of LTP induction produced similar levels of potentiation\nto those emerging from direct PF stimulation (Fig. 5d,e). CV\u00012\nanalysis also showed that the origins of plasticity at dispersed PF\ninputs were identical to those produced by direct PF input. We\nconclude that, at the relatively low stimulus strengths used\nthroughout this study, the pattern of synaptic input to PCs is\nunlikely to account for the difference in susceptibility to plasticity\nof ascending axon and parallel fiber inputs.\nDiscussion\nThe most striking observation from these results is that synapses\nsupplied by the ascending segment of the GC axon to PCs are\nlargely resistant to all of the forms of plasticity we tested com-\npared with their parallel fiber counterparts. This provides com-\npelling evidence that the two segments of the GC axon fulfill\nfundamentally different roles in cerebellar signal processing and\nadds an additional level of complexity to our knowledge of cere-\nbellar signal processing.\nThe highly orderedmorphology of the cerebellar cortex allows\nthe independent and selective activation of ascending andparallel\nfibers segments of granule cell axons. Although the absolute de-\ngree of pathway selectivity produced by GC layer and molecular\nlayer stimulation remains to be verified experimentally, it is suf-\nficient to reveal clear differences in the transmission properties of\nsynapses in each pathway (Sims and Hartell, 2005). Presynaptic\nand postsynaptic specialization at ascending axon and parallel\nfiber synapses confers each segment of the GC axon with distinct\nFigure 3.

Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):5153\u20135159 \u2022 5157\ntransmission properties. This enables GCs to transmit different\ntypes of information to PCs contacted by different sections of the\naxon according to their patterns of activity. We have previously\nargued that the relatively high synaptic release probability com-\nbined with multiple points of contact with a single PC enable\nascending axon inputs to a PC to transmit low frequency infor-\nmation highly reliably, and, as such, they serve as event detectors\nto relay information within a single microzone that receives sen-\nsory information from a specific areas of the periphery. If this is\nthe principal role of the ascending axon, then plasticity would\nserve little or no function and so the absence of any form of\nlong-term plasticity at these synapses lends support to this\nnotion.\nParallel fiber synapses have lower quantal amplitudes and re-\nlease probabilities than those formed by ascending axons, and\nthey can sustain short-term facilitation for longer, allowing them\nto transmit bursts of higher frequency information (Sims and\nHartell, 2005). We now show that they can also readily undergo\npresynaptic and postsynaptic forms of long-termplasticity. Thus,\ntheir role is distinct from that of ascending axon synapses because\nthey represent a pathway that is highly plastic and subject to\ndynamic regulation. Because they cross large areas of the cerebel-\nlar cortex, these properties provide parallel fibers with the capac-\nity to pass information between microzones and undergo\nchanges in synaptic strength in a direction that is determined by\nconcurrent climbing fiber activity. In this way, parallel fiber in-\nputs to PCs can be selectively dampened or strengthened and this\nestablishes a pattern of communication betweenmicrozones that\nis based on learned experience.\nThe absence of plasticity at ascending axon synapses might\nindicate that they are intrinsically different from parallel fiber\nsynapses and that they lack some of the cellular machinery nec-\nessary for plasticity. However, the limited ability of ascending\naxon synapses to undergo LTP in response to forskolin or 16 Hz\nstimulationmight indicate that they have already undergone pre-\nsynaptic potentiation and that this mechanism is saturated. This\nis an attractive hypothesis, because it explains their higher release\nprobabilities compared with parallel fiber synapses.\nPostsynaptic differences between ascending axon and parallel\nfiber synapses are less easily explained by the assumption that the\ntwo sets of synapses are mechanistically identical but simply exist\nin different plastic states. If this was the case, then one would\nexpect both sets of synapses to be fully reversible, but this was\nclearly not the case. Therefore, we predict that there must be\nsome intrinsic postsynaptic difference between the synapse types.\nA systematic evaluation of the presynaptic and postsynaptic ele-\nments at each synapse type is severely hampered by the difficulty\nin distinguishing between axonal segments at the ultrastructural\nlevel. Nevertheless, studies have revealed that there are presynap-\ntic and postsynaptic morphological differences (Gundappa-\nSulur et al., 1999).\nThe relative positions of synapses formed by each segment of\nthe GC axon could also influence the induction of plasticity. As-\ncending axon synapses are formed on smaller diameter, more\ndistally situated dendrites (Gundappa-Sulur et al., 1999). This\ncould conceivably place them outside the influence of the CF,\nwhich forms synapses on primary dendrites. If so, then the cal-\ncium signal supplied by CF activation may be insufficient to trig-\nger LTD. This would not explain, however, the additional resis-\ntance of ascending axon synapses to CF-independent LTD nor\nthe absence of postsynaptic LTP, which does not require such\nhigh levels of postsynaptic calcium elevation (Coesmans et al.,\n2004).\nThe temporal and spatial patterns of synaptic activation also\ninfluence the release of several factors involved in LTD and LTP\ninduction, including NO, cGMP, and glutamate (Hartell et al.,\n2001; Marcaggi and Attwell, 2005; Namiki et al., 2005). Activa-\ntion of spatially close synapses can cause glutamate spillover and\nactivation of postsynaptic type 1 metabotropic glutamate recep-\ntors (mGluR1), leading to the production of endocannabinoids.\nThese act retrogradely to limitNOand glutamate release and they\nhave recently been shown to be involved in LTD (Safo and Re-\ngehr, 2005). It is conceivable, therefore, that direct stimulation of\nparallel fibers within the molecular layer might produce a rela-\ntively dense activation of synapses to a given PC than ascending\naxon activation, leading to higher levels of NO production, glu-\ntamate spillover, and mGluR1 activation (Marcaggi and Attwell,\n2005), and consequently calcium release from intracellular stores\n(Finch and Augustine, 1998; Takechi et al., 1998). All of these\nFigure 5.

Because granule cell ascending axons rise to different levels within the molecular layer,\nstimulation of the granule cell layer 150\u2013300\u0001m lateral to the recorded PC should produce a\nmore dispersed pattern of parallel fiber activation compared with molecular layer stimulation.\nThe effects of conjunctive activation of the CF input with lateral GC stimulation (b), 1 Hz raised\nintensity stimulation (RIS) (c), 1 Hz stimulation (d), and 16Hz stimulation of the lateral GC layer\nare shown (e) together with representative traces sampled before (black traces) and 20 min\nafter (gray traces) each induction protocol. Pooled data represent the means and SEs of five to\nseven separate cells. f illustrates the resulting changes in CV\u00012 for each protocol.

If ascending axon inputs to a PC are more\ndispersed, onewould predict that they are less able to trigger these\npathways and consequently less likely to induce LTD or LTP.\nSynapse density would appear not to account for the selective\nplasticity at parallel fibers, however, because presynaptic and\npostsynaptic forms of LTP, as well as LTD, were evident at syn-\napses activated by lateral stimulation of GCs, which is expected to\nproduce a dispersed synaptic activation of PC by parallel fiber\nsegments of the GC axon.\nDifferences in transmission properties between ascending\naxon and parallel fiber synapses, and their disparate abilities to\nundergo short- and longer-term forms of plasticity, may help to\naccount for the limited spread of afferent information along par-\nallel fibers. We suggest, therefore, that synapses formed by the\ntwo segments of the granule cell axon should be considered sep-\narately in experimental and theoretical studies of cerebellar cor-\ntical function.\nReferences\nAndersonWW, Collingridge GL (1999) A data acquisition program for on-\nline analysis of long-term potentiation and long-term depression.
