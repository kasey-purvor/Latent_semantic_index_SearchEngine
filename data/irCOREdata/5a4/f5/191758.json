In addition to improving survival, a \nrandomised controlled trial of ECMO in the treatment of sick newborns resulted in improved \nrespiratory function at 1 year (3). The beneficial influence of an ECMO policy has been shown to \nextend to these children when studied at 7 years (4). \n \nDuring the time over which ECMO has been available, other treatments (such as surfactant therapy, \ninhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)) have become \navailable. In some centres ECMO is now used in a smaller proportion of patients in particular \ndiagnostic subgroups than was previously the case (5). There has been an overall fall in the number \nof neonatal patients treated with ECMO and a fall in the average number treated at each ECMO \ncentre since the early 1990s (6). Trials of iNO in neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure have \nshown that it results in a decreased need for ECMO (7,8) and is cost-effective (9,10). Despite the \nincreasing use of iNO, ECMO still remains an essential back-up treatment for some patients such as \nthose with pneumothorax (11). There is less evidence for the effectiveness of iNO specifically for \nthe treatment of infants born at or near term (12), but it would appear to reduce the need for ECMO \nand be cost\u2013effective (13).  The benefits of iNO have been shown in both North America and \nEurope, but differences in survival rates between the continents suggests that approaches to \ntreatment are not the same and highlights the need for caution when extrapolating findings (13). \n \nAgainst the background of changes in the population of patients referred for ECMO with regard to \ntheir diagnosis, treatment prior to referral, and possible clinical status at the time of initiating \nECMO, there is the likelihood of changes in outcome. Diagnosis-specific mortality rates for infants \nwith congenital diaphragmatic hernia, meconium aspiration, respiratory distress syndrome and \n 4\nsepsis did not alter significantly between 1988 and 1998 (6), but there have been few reports of \nrespiratory morbidity or lung function tests. As the ECMO centre treating the largest number of \npatients in the UK we are able to report respiratory outcomes in over 100 infants treated after April \n1997. Information on almost all infants receiving ECMO in the UK between January 1993 and \nNovember 1995 is also available to us, since all such infants were enrolled in a nationwide trial of \nECMO (2) and almost 80% of these participated in respiratory follow-up at the age of 1 year (3). \nThe first aim of the current study was, therefore, to compare respiratory outcomes of infants \nreceiving ECMO in recent years with those from 10 years ago. The second aim was to see whether \nthe respiratory outcome varied with diagnostic group, and this was pursued with the more recent \ndata exclusively from our own centre. This could be important when counselling parents of infants \nreceiving ECMO and have implications for workload planning of respiratory centres. \n \n \nMethods \nSubjects \nBetween 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2003 186 infants below 12 months received ECMO at our \ncentre in Leicester, of whom 137 survived for follow-up 1 year later. One hundred and eight infants \ncame for general and developmental follow-up (not reported here) and 106 of them had assessment \nof their lung function, which was routine in our center. The percentage of eligible infants in the \ncurrent study group receiving respiratory follow-up was 77%.  \n  \nThe lung function from this group was compared with that of 51 infants who were studied earlier, as \npart of the UK ECMO trial (2).  This national trial randomized 185 infants to either referral for \nECMO at one of 5 centers or to conventional management. One hundred and three survived to \ndischarge, and 99 (62 ECMO) were alive and potentially available for respiratory function testing at \none year of age. Seventy-eight infants (51 ECMO) were studied at one of 2 centers (including the \n 5\nfacility testing all the later cohort) involved in the respiratory follow-up (3). The percentage of \neligible infants from the UK ECMO study receiving respiratory follow-up was 78%. \n \nThe criteria for offering ECMO differed between the two populations. Those infants who entered \nthe UK ECMO trial were term infants of 2kg birth weight or greater. An entry requirement was an \noxygenation index of above 40, or PaCO2 above 12 kPa, and less than 10 days\u2019 high-pressure \nventilation and age below 28 days at trial entry (2). The criteria for offering ECMO in the time \nframe for treating the current population were relaxed and 8 of the 106 infants (7.5%) were older \nthan 28 days when ECMO was commenced.  Twelve infants (11%) were born preterm (before 37 \nweeks GA).  \n \nThe procedure for respiratory function tests common to infants in the UK ECMO trial and those \nstudied later (lung volume, specific conductance, and maximum expiratory flow) were identical (3). \n \nProcedure \nInfants attended the laboratory as outpatients. A questionnaire was administered to collect \ninformation on symptoms, medication and health care consultations and the infant was given a \nclinical examination. Parents gave written consent for respiratory function testing, baseline oxygen \nsaturation was recorded from a pulse oximeter (Nellcor) and infants were weighed, measured, and \nsedated with chloral hydrate (100mg.kg-1 bodyweight, up to a maximum dose of 1g). Once asleep, \nthe pulse oximeter was re-attached to the foot for safety monitoring. \n \nMeasurements of lung volume and specific conductance \nThe infant was placed within the Jaeger whole-body plethysmograph for measurements of lung \nvolume (FRCpleth) and specific conductance during initial inspiration (SGawII) by previously \nreported methods (3,14). Briefly, the infant breathed through a facemask (Rendell Baker size 2) and \n 6\npneumotachograph (Jaeger infant model), which were connected to a valve block that permitted the \ninfant to breathe heated, humidified air for measurement of SGawII, or transient occlusion of the \nexternal airway. Signals of mask pressure, flow and plethysmograph pressure were recorded onto a \npersonal computer (Elonex) with specialist software (RASP, Physiologic, Newbury, Berks). After a \nperiod of quiet breathing of heated, humidified air the valves were closed and the infant made 2 or 3 \nrespiratory efforts against the occlusion to permit calculation of FRCpleth. Approximately five \nseparate measurements of FRCpleth were made. All recordings were visually inspected and any that \nthe operator judged to be not technically acceptable were discarded. SGawII was calculated as the \nmean of the best seven individual breaths (selected by the operator on the basis of graphical \nappearance). The mean of all technically acceptable recordings of FRCpleth was reported. \n \nMeasurements of maximum expiratory flow \nThe infant was wrapped in an inflatable \u2018squeeze\u2019 jacket for measurements of maximum expiratory \nflow (VmaxFRC). A period of regular breathing of approximately 20 seconds was observed prior to \ninflating the jacket at the end of a tidal inspiration (15). Measurements of VmaxFRC were repeated \nover a range of jacket pressures up to a maximum of 6.5 kPa to obtain the highest values of \nVmaxFRC and the pressure at which this was achieved (the optimal pressure) was noted for each \ninfant. Several measurements were obtained at optimal pressure. The highest value of VmaxFRC was \nreported, provided that the next highest value was within 10% of this. \n 7\n  \nMeasurements of forced expired volumes by the raised volume technique (RV-RTC) \nA bias flow of air was attached to the pneumotachograph using a T-piece attached to an adjustable \nblow-off valve set at 2.0kPa. Augmented breaths were delivered through the facemask by manually \noccluding the bias flow at the onset of inspiration so that air was directed into the lungs. At the end \nof inspiration (when the applied pressure and volume reached plateaux) the occlusion was removed \nand the infant breathed out passively. A series of four successive augmented inspirations was \ndelivered with passive exhalations, followed by a fifth augmented inspiration, which was \naccompanied by jacket inflation at end inspiration using the previously-determined optimal jacket \npressure. Up to six measurements of RV-RTC were made in each infant. \n \nMeasurements of RV-RTC were analysed using specialist software (\u2018Squeeze\u2019 version 2.04, Dixon \nand Stocks, Imperial College, London 1999), using a published technique (16). The largest forced \nexpired volume breathed out in the RV-RTC manoeuvre (FVCp) was recorded. The forced expired \nvolume in the first 0.4s and 0.5s of expiration (FEV0.4 and FEV0.5) were measured from the RV-\nRTC and the highest individual values reported. \n \nTidal breathing analysis \nThe time to peak tidal expiratory flow (tPTEF) and the ratio of tPTEF to expiratory time (tPTEF:tE) \nwere measured from periods of quiet breathing recorded prior to VmaxFRC using specialist software \n(\u2018Squeeze\u2019 version 2.04, Dixon and Stocks, Imperial College, London 1999). The five breaths \nimmediately prior to jacket inflation were taken from each of the first five recordings of VmaxFRC \nand mean values of tPTEF:tE were calculated. \n \n 8\nAnalysis of data \nIn the first stage of the analysis the demographic data from infants in the current follow-up study \nwere compared with those who were assigned to the ECMO limb of the UK ECMO trial using \nunpaired t-tests or \u03c7-squared tests. In order to take account of sex- and length-related differences in \nlung function, measurements of FRCpleth and VmaxFRC were expressed as SD scores (17,18). The \ndifferences of the mean SD scores were calculated and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of \nthe differences of the means were used to compare the two study populations.  Measurements of \nSGawII can be compared directly and so the 95% CI of the difference of the means was used to \ndetermine whether there was any difference between the groups. \n \nIn the second stage of the analysis infants in the current study were divided into subgroups on the \nbasis of underlying diagnosis. Since all infants in the current study received ECMO at a single \ncenter, discharge summaries were readily available. The diagnostic subgroup was based on the \ndischarge summary of each infant, which was reviewed by one of the clinical staff from the ECMO \nunit. Demographic data and lung function were compared between different subgroups using \nanalysis of variance.  \n \nResults \nComparison of current population with those assigned to ECMO in the original trial \nOne hundred and eighty six infants received ECMO between April 1997 and April 2003, of whom \n137 survived beyond one year and 106 attended for respiratory function testing. The main \nunderlying reason for ECMO in the infants who were tested was Meconium Aspiration (MAS), \nwhich accounted for 67 (63%) of the infants studied. Neonatal sepsis accounted for the next largest \nsubgroup (11 infants). Ten infants started ECMO when over 2 weeks of age (\u2018older\u2019) because of \nsevere bronchiolitis (9 infants) or pertussis. The median age of commencing ECMO in this group \nwas 42 days (range 17-188), and 6 of them had been born preterm. Smaller subgroups received \n 9\nECMO for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN, 7 infants), or respiratory \ndistress syndrome (RDS, 5 infants). The remaining 6 infants were treated for congenital \ndiaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary haemorrhage, or aspiration of blood following maternal \nantepartum haemorrhage. The infants who attended for respiratory function tests were not different \nfrom those who did not attend with respect to gestational age, birthweight, underlying diagnosis or \nduration of ECMO (data not shown).  \n \nThe current study group was initially compared to the 51 infants assigned to ECMO in the original \ntrial (Table 1). There were no overall differences in weight or length but the current population was \nslightly older. This was mainly because the current population included the subgroup of 10 infants \nwho received ECMO outside the first 2 weeks of life, and were therefore older than the other infants \nwhen they were referred to the lab 1-year after ECMO. There were no differences in the proportions \nof infants on respiratory medications at the time of testing or the frequency of reported symptoms of \nupper respiratory tract infection since discharge from hospital, but the current population were more \nlikely to come from a smoking household (p<0.05). The measurements of FRCpleth were not \ndifferent in the two populations and were very close to the predicted value. The mean VmaxFRC for \nboth populations was within predicted limits but tended to be lower than predicted (18). The mean \nVmaxFRC from the current population (seen outside the trial setting) showed a strong trend towards \nimprovement when compared with the infants in the original trial, although this did not reach \nconventional levels of statistical significance (Table 1). SGaw showed a marked trend towards \nimprovement in the current populatn (Table 1). \n \nAlthough there were no statistically significant differences in lung function, there were differences \nin diagnostic profile that could have confounded the results. The largest subgroup in both \npopulations comprised those with meconium aspiration, so we compared these infants directly to \nsee whether any potential differences in the practice of ECMO might have impacted on the outcome \n 10\n(Table 2). There were no differences in age, weight or length of these two subgroups. The SD \nscores for FRCpleth and VmaxFRC were not different from each other, but there was a strong trend for \nSGaw to be better in the infants treated more recently than in those who were part of the ECMO \ntrial.  \n \nComparison of different diagnostic subgroups \nData from the current population of infants were divided into diagnostic subgroups and \ndemographic data and lung function were compared (Table 3). There were no differences between \nthe groups with respect to weight or length, but the \u2018older\u2019 group had a shorter mean gestational age \nand tended to be older at the time of test than the other subgroups. The duration of ECMO varied \nbetween the subgroups, with those treated for RDS or who started ECMO beyond the first 2 weeks \nof life needing ECMO for longer. The median duration of ECMO in the \u2018older\u2019 group was 7.5 days \n(range 4-24 days) and for the RDS group the median was 8 days (range 4-12).  \n \nResting lung volume was similar in all subgroups, as shown by the lack of differences in FRCpleth. \nThere were strong trends towards significant variation in airway function, seen in both VmaxFRC \n(p=0.057) and SGaw (p=0.076). This was because the \u2018older\u2019 infants and those treated for RDS had \nworse values than the other subgroups. A similar pattern was seen with data from RV-RTC. There \nwere no differences between the groups in FVCp, which may be considered as a surrogate for lung \nvolume. The infants treated for RDS had the lowest values of FEV0.4 and FEV0.5 out of the whole \npopulation, although differences between groups failed to reach statistical significance. When these \ntimed volumes were expressed as percentages of FVCp most subgroups had very similar values \n(Table 3) but the infants treated for RDS had much poorer function. Infants who were older when \ntreated had intermediate values. \n \nAnalysis of tidal breathing (tPTEF:tE) did not demonstrate any differences between the subgroups. \n 11\n Discussion \nWe have shown that the respiratory outcomes of infants receiving ECMO in more recent years are \nnot statistically different from those seen at the time of the UK ECMO trial. There is a trend for \nimproved outcome, seen in the measurements of airway function (VmaxFRC, SGaw, FEV0.4 and \nFEV0.5). When analysis was restricted to infants treated for MAS this pattern was retained. When \ninfants in the current cohort were categorised according to the underlying reason for ECMO, the \n\u2018older\u2019 group and (more particularly) those treated for RDS had similar lung volumes but poorer \nairway function than the other groups.  \n \nThe comparison of respiratory function in the two populations may be biased by several factors, \nincluding: the inclusion\/exclusion criteria for ECMO; differences in treatment between the two \npopulations (including differences in the delivery of ECMO); the survival rates of the two \npopulations; and whether the infants tested were representative of the survivors. \n \nThe 1-year survival for infants in the original UK trial who were assigned to ECMO was 68% and \nin the more recent cohort this had increased to 73%. Although this will reflect changes both in the \ncriteria for offering ECMO and treatment modalities between the two populations, the net effect of \nimproved survival might have been an overall worsening of respiratory morbidity due to increased \nsurvival of infants with severely compromised lung function. Our finding of a trend towards \nimprovement in lung function shows that this is not the case. By repeating the analysis and \nrestricting it to those infants with a primary diagnosis of MAS we have shown that there is a marked \ntrend towards improvement in airway function, which strongly suggests ongoing refinement of \neligibility criteria and\/or management of infants in our ECMO unit. The reported frequency of \nURTI and the use of respiratory medications were, however, unchanged.  \n \n 12\nAlthough the respiratory function one year after treatment is similar in those infants treated recently \nand those who received ECMO as part of the UK ECMO trial, and shows a trend to improvement in \nairway function, the heterogeneous nature of the population could mask important differences \nrelated to underlying reason for ECMO treatment. Our second aim was to examine respiratory \noutcome with respect to diagnostic subgroup. With the exception of the MAS subgroup, the small \nsize of the subgroups is a limitation of our study. In addressing our second aim, however, we have \nshown that infants with RDS or those whose treatment started beyond the first 2 weeks of life had \npoorer airway function than other subgroups. These two subgroups had required ECMO for longer \nthan the others, suggesting that their underlying condition was worse at the outset and took longer \nto improve to the point where the lungs could adequately their function of oxygenation. Previous \nreports of ECMO used to treat infants with bronchiolitis also demonstrated a need for relatively \nlong duration of treatment (19, 20, 21). Our \u2018older\u2019 group included one infant with pertussis, and \nour group have previously reported the poor outcome in terms of survival for such infants when \nreferred for ECMO (22). The remaining 9 infants in the \u2018older\u2019 group all had RSV bronchiolitis and \n6 of them had been born at or prior to 32 weeks gestational age. Only 2 out of the 10 \u2018older\u2019 infants \nwould have met the eligibility criteria for the UK trial in terms of their gestation and age at onset of \nECMO, so the requirement of this group for extended time on ECMO is particularly relevant for \nplanning of healthcare provision in future. The cost-effectiveness of ECMO in the context of the \nUK trial has been reported, and most of the additional costs of ECMO relate mainly to care in the \nneonatal period (23). The cost-effectiveness of ECMO for other groups of infants should be the \nbasis of future economic research (23). \n \nOur largest subgroup comprised infants with MAS, who had normal values of FRCpleth, SGaw and \nVmaxFRC. Predicted values of the other indices of lung function are less well established but the \nMAS infants had the highest measurements of FEV0.4 and FEV0.5 of any subgroup. Reports of lung \nfunction from children who survived MAS indicate airway obstruction, hyperinflation, and an \n 13\nincrease in bronchial reactivity, although these groups did not include patients treated with ECMO \n(24, 25). A report of lung function in children of school age who received ECMO in the neonatal \nperiod found that they were hyperinflated, as shown by an increase in residual volume (26). This \nstudy did not report measurements of FRC. In contrast, data from the children in the UK trial who \nreceived ECMO had normal values of FRC when compared with healthy matched controls, whereas \nthe infants randomized to conventional management had elevated FRC (27). The role of ECMO in \npreventing lung injury in infants with MAS needs further research. \n \nThe three remaining subgroups in our recent cohort (PPHN, sepsis, and \u2018other\u2019) were similar to \ninfants with MAS, in that the mean measurements of FRCpleth and VmaxFRC were within the \npredicted ranges. The measurements from RV-RTC and tidal breathing from these subgroups were \nindistinguishable from the MAS infants.  \n \nThis study provides the opportunity to examine which indices of respiratory function best identify \nany differences between groups, although this is limited by the small sizes of some subgroups. \nMeasurements of lung volume, whether direct (FRCpleth) or indirect (FVCp) were not indicative of \nmajor differences, either between infants in the original UK trial and the current cohort or between \ndifferent diagnostic subgroups. Predicted ranges are available for FRCpleth (18) and it would appear \nas if all groups of infants have volumes close to prediction. In contrast, airway function as assessed \nby VmaxFRC shows that the infants treated for RDS have mean values below the predicted range \nand the \u2018older\u2019 infants are on the lower limits of prediction. Other indices of airway function that \nare derived from RV-RTC (FEV0.4, FEV0.5, FEV0.4\/FVCp and FEV0.5\/FVCp) also indicate poorer \nfunction in these groups. The measurement derived from tidal breathing (tPTEF:tE) failed to \ndiscriminate between the subgroups. Low values of tPTEF:tE have been shown to be associated \nwith low forced expiratory flows in infants (28) and this, coupled with the attractiveness of a simple \n 14\nindex that could potentially be measured without the need for sedation or complex equipment, was \nour reason to apply it in the present study.  \n \nIn conclusion, this study represents the largest respiratory follow-up of infants receiving ECMO to \ndate. It shows that the respiratory outcome of infants treated subsequent to the UK trial remains \ngood at one year after ECMO, and even shows a trend towards improvement.  Certain subgroups of \ninfants, namely those treated for RDS or those treated beyond the first 3 weeks for bronchiolitis or \npneumonia, require ECMO for longer and have poorer pulmonary function when followed up 12-\nmonths later. The modest size of the subgroups, however, indicates a need for caution in the \ninterpretation of the data. Ongoing respiratory follow-up to include larger numbers of patients with \nfindings extending to later childhood and beyond would be important when providing information \nto parents of infants being treated and may have implications for workload planning of ECMO \nunits.  \n \n 15\n Acknowledgements \nThe follow-up reported in this study was funded by the Department of Health.
