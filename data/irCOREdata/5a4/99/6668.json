I fear that such an approach would lead to irrefutable platitudes, and those who\nhave read my editorials over the years (how few are they?) will be aware that I have never\nshunned controversy - indeed, I have been accused on several occasions of wilful and\nunjustified provocation. Unsubstantiated as this accusation is, I would not wish my last\neditorial to break with its tradition. In this final comment as Editor, therefore, I shall\nexpress a certain frustration.\nGraham Chesters, Jonathan Darby and I met in Oxford in 1992 and decided to found ALT.\nWe met again a little later in York with (as I remember - apologies for any omissions) Neil\nMorgan and Graham Walker of BT, Peter Goodyear, Nick Hammond, Mike Kibby and\nRay McAleese, in order to determine how we might proceed. Had any of us at that meeting\nbeen asked where learning technology would be six years hence, I suspect that the\nprevailing prediction would have been one of an extensive take-up within higher education.\nThe Internet as we know it today did not exist, nor were CD-ROM drives or tens of\nMegabytes of RAM the norm, but digital technology was progressing with such rapidity\nthat some of us could almost contemplate a HAL, the super-computer in the 1960s film\n2001: A Space Odyssey, up and running in our universities before the new millennium.\nHow would universities be able to resist the marvels which learning technology would soon\nbe able to deliver, particularly in view of the massification of higher education combined\nwith little or no prospect of significant increases in teaching staff?\nThe reality is that take-up has not been as widespread as we imagined it would be - not by\na long way - and neither the hardware nor the courseware are fully able to match user-\n2\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 2\nexpectations. Why? The two facts are self-evidently closely linked, but for the sake of\nclarity I will deal with them separately.\nThose who met in York were not naive. They were well aware of the attitudes, within most\nuniversities, of both senior management (concerns about cost-effectiveness, general\ncaution) and of many academics (resistance to change, not-invented-here syndrome). That\nis precisely why we thought it such a good idea to create an association for the promotion\nof learning technology, one of whose principal, if formally unstated, aims would be to help\nbring about a modification of those attitudes. The plain truth is that we underestimated the\nstrength of the anxieties and the depth of the entrenchment, as well as the future difficulty\nof producing bullet-proof and well-designed educational software which did not force the\ntail to wag the dog. Not that ALT has failed to achieve anything (oh the contrary), or that,\nwith or without ALT'S impetus, attitudes have not budged; but it is evident that learning\ntechnology, in most places of higher education (with some notable exceptions), is still\nperceived as an add-on, and often a minor one at that, rather than an integral part of\nteaching and learning, and that even includes the use of the ubiquitous World-Wide Web.\nThe failure of technology to meet user-expectations is something we might have foreseen if\nforecasting demand and development in consumer electronics were not so problematic.\nComputer technology has forged ahead in the last six years, but so have expectations about\nwhat it ought to be capable of. The computer industry is peculiar, perhaps unique, in that\nexpectations have preceded developments, unlike, say, the automobile or TV industries where\ndevelopments tend to create the demand. The ingenuous user today expects broadcast-\nquality digital video displayed on a computer screen, as seen on TV and in films (not only\nscience-fiction films). What he or she generally gets is jerky and\/or grainy video in a small\nwindow, with not-quite-perfect lip synchronization, and constrained, over-structured so-\ncalled interactivity. The Internet, with its more or less reliable and well-established email\nfacility and its vanishingly large store of information, does not quite fall into the same\ncategory, but even this supposed superhighway has not fulfilled all expectations because of its\nfrequent and erratic delays, and because it is so colossal a haystack in which to find the\nneedle. It will be a long time before user-desires in the domain of learning technology are\nfulfilled. In the meantime, even (no: especially) the most ambitious courseware, which\nmanages to squeeze the last drop of capability out of the available technology, disappoints\nthose teachers and students who are not impressed by technical achievement per se, or who\nare initially impressed but soon rebel against the constraints the computer imposes on them.\nDespite all that, my last word will be what some may see as a platitude, but which, if it is\none, is nevertheless meant as sincerely as I can mean it. As I intimated above, ALT has many\nachievements to its credit. Its exciting and influential events, its excellent and informative\nWeb site and Newsletter, its outstanding administration, and of course its enthusiastic\nmembership, have together kept our aim firmly on target while moving us ever closer to it.\nI hope that readers will consider that this journal too has made a valuable contribution. I\ngenuinely envy the new Editor in the challenge he or she is to take up. If only the Earth\nturned on its axis every 48 hours. . .\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
