Introduction\nThe purpose of this paper is to study the spectral properties of (the stationary form\nof) the equation\n(r+ ieA)\u00a3 u = \u00a7mu (1.1)\nin Minkowski 3-space. Here,1 r\u00b7 = @=@x \u00b7 is the (covariant) space time derivative,\nA is a given electromagnetic potential (real vector valued function), u is an unknown\ncomplex vector-valued function, and we are using the relativistic system of units,\ni.e. ~ = 1, c = 1 and e \u00ba \u00a1 1=\np\n137. The Minkowski metric is assumed to be\ng \u00b7 \u00b8 = diag(+1; \u00a1 1; \u00a1 1) and the vector product is de\u00ad ned as (v\u00a3w) \u00b6 := e\u00b6 \u00b7 \u00b8 v \u00b7 w \u00b8 ,\nwhere e\u00b6 \u00b7 \u00b8 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with e012 = +1. Equation (1.1)\nwas suggested in [3] as part of a general programme of \u00ad nding possible tensor\nalternatives to the Dirac equation.\nSwitching to atomic units, i.e. taking e = \u00a1 1, ~ = 1, m = 1 and c \u00ba 137\u00be 1, we\ncan rewrite (1.1) explicitly as0@ 0 \u00a1 P2 P1\u00a1 P2 0 c\u00a11P0\nP1 \u00a1 c\u00a11P0 0\n1A 0@u0u1\nu2\n1A = \u00a7ic\n0@u0u1\nu2\n1A ; (1.2)\nwhere P = ir \u00a1 eA = ir + A is the electromagnetic energy momentum vector.\n1In what follows Minkowski tensor indices will be denoted by Greek letters and take the values\n0, 1, 2.\n1065\nc\u00ae 2001 The Royal Society of Edinburgh\n1066 D. M. Elton\nRemark 1.1. We have included a factor of 1=c into the magnetic potential (A1; A2),\nwhich is customary in mathematical literature on the Dirac equation (see, for exam-\nple, remark 2 in x 6.1 of [9]). Physically, this convention means that the magnetic\n\u00ad eld is assumed to be quite strong, so that in the \u00ad rst approximation the energy\nlevels are described by the Pauli equation and not by the Schrodinger equation.\nThis simpli\u00ad es the asymptotic analysis by reducing the chain of successive approx-\nimations (Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac) to (Pauli, Dirac).\nThe stationary form of (1.2) is obtained by assuming A is independent of x0 and\nu = u(x1; x2)e\u00a1i\u00b6 x\n0\n, where \u00b6 is a spectral parameter. Formally, this allows us to\nreplace P0 with \u00b6 + \u00a9 , where we write \u00a9 = eA0 = \u00a1 A0 for the electric potential.\nFurthermore, we can use the \u00ad rst row of (1.2) to eliminate u0 from the remaining\ntwo rows. Taking the equation with the upper sign (from now on the other equation\nwill be discussed only for the purpose of comparison), we get\u00b3\n~A \u00a1 \u00b6\n\u00b3\n0 \u00a1 i\ni 0\n\u00b4\u00b4\nu = 0; (1.3)\nwhere u = (u1; u2)\nT is some function from R2 into C2 and\n~A =\n\u00b3\nP 22 \u00a1 P2P1\n\u00a1 P1P2 P 21\n\u00b4\n+\n\u00b3\nc2 i\u00a9\n\u00a1 i \u00a9 c2\n\u00b4\n:\nNotation. Having reduced the problem to one on R2, we will now need to work\nwith the 2-vector part of various 3-vectors. Following tradition, we shall use the\ncontravariant form of the 3-vector for these purposes, i.e. if v is a 3-vector with a\n2-vector part u, then the components of u are given by ui = v\ni = \u00a1 vi for i = 1; 2. In\nparticular, denoting the magnetic potential and the momentum 2-vectors by A and\nP , respectively, and relabelling the original electromagnetic potential and energy\nmomentum 3-vectors as A0 and P 0, respectively, we have\nA = (A1; A2) := (A\n01; A02) = \u00a1 (A01; A02)\nand\nP = (P1; P2) := (P\n01; P 02) = \u00a1 (P 01; P 02):\nFor i = 1; 2, it follows that Pi = \u00a1 i@i \u00a1 eAi = \u00a1 i@i + Ai, where @i = @=@xi is the\npartial derivative with respect to xi, the ith coordinate. From now on, we shall use\nAi and Pi to refer to the components of the 2-vectors A and P , respectively.\nA computationally more convenient form of the spectral problem given by (1.3)\nis obtained by applying the constant unitary transformation\nU =\n1p\n2\n\u00b3\n1 i\ni 1\n\u00b4\n:\nSetting x\u00a7 = x1 \u00a7 ix2 for any vector x = (x1; x2), we have\nU \u00a4 ~AU = 1\n2\n\u00b3\nP\u00a1P+ \u00a1 iP 2\u00a1\niP 2+ P + P\u00a1\n\u00b4\n+\n\u00b3\nc2 \u00a1 \u00a9 0\n0 c2 + \u00a9\n\u00b4\n=\n\u00b3\nH +P B\n\u00a4\nB H\u00a1P\n\u00b4\n+ c2I;\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1067\nwhere\nH\u00a7P =\n1\n2P\u00a8P\u00a7 \u00a8 \u00a9 = 12 (P 21 + P22)\u00a7 12H \u00a8 \u00a9 ;\nH = @1A2 \u00a1 @2A1; B = 12 iP 2+\n)\n(1.4)\nand I is the 2\u00a3 2 identity matrix.

The operators H\u00a7P are just the Pauli operators for the electron and\npositron, respectively, and cH is the magnetic \u00ad eld strength (see also remark 1.1).\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In x 2 we give a rigorous mathematical\nstatement of our spectral problem and in x 3 we state our main results regarding\nthe essential spectrum (theorem 3.1) and the behaviour of the discrete spectrum as\nc ! +1 (theorem 3.3). The former result is proved in xx 4 and 5, while the latter\nis proved in xx 6 and 7.\nThe results stated in x 3 are naturally motivated by the structure of our equa-\ntion (1.5), but their proofs are quite technical. This is related to the fact that the\nproblem (1.5) is not elliptic. Indeed, a straightforward calculation of the principal\nsymbol of the operator A gives\n1\n2\n\u00b3\n\u00b9 21 + \u00b9\n2\n2 \u00a1 i(\u00b9 1 \u00a1 i \u00b9 2)2\ni( \u00b9 1 + i \u00b9 2)\n2 \u00b9 21 + \u00b9\n2\n2\n\u00b4\n;\nand it is easy to see that the determinant of this matrix is zero. Consequently,\nequation (1.5) cannot be viewed as an analytic perturbation of the Pauli (or Dirac)\nequation.\n2. Mathematical statement of the problem\nEquation (1.5) gives rise to a linear spectral pencil problem. Various parts of the\nspectrum of such a problem can be de\u00ad ned by analogy with the de\u00ad nitions for\nstandard spectral problems.\nDefinition 2.1. Suppose A is de\u00ad ned as a closed (unbounded) operator on some\ndense domain DomA \u00bb L2(R2;C2). We de\u00ad ne the J-spectrum of A, which will be\ndenoted by \u00bc J(A), to be the complement of the set of all z 2 C for which A \u00a1 zJ\nis boundedly invertible. The J-essential spectrum (denoted by \u00bc J Es s (A)) is de\u00ad ned\nto be the set of all z 2 C for which A \u00a1 zJ is not Fredholm (where a closed densely\nde\u00ad ned operator B on L2 is said to be Fredholm if RanB is closed and KerB and\nL2=RanB are both \u00ad nite dimensional). If Ker(A \u00a1 \u00b6 J) 6= 0, then \u00b6 2 \u00bc J(A) will\nbe called a J-eigenvalue of A.\n1068 D. M. Elton\nRemark 2.2. The relationship\nA \u00a1 zJ = J(JA \u00a1 zI) = (AJ \u00a1 zI)J (2.1)\nallows us to reformulate statements regarding the J -spectrum of A in terms of the\n(regular) spectrum of JA or AJ . In particular, \u00bc J(A) = \u00bc (JA) = \u00bc (AJ) (with a\nsimilar relationship holding for the essential spectra), while \u00b6 is a J -eigenvalue of A\nif and only if it is an eigenvalue of JA or AJ . The alternative points of view given\nby (2.1) will be used repeatedly below, especially in xx 6 and 7 to appropriately\nmodify standard properties of resolvents to the case of linear spectral pencils.\nSuppose \u00b6 2 \u00bc J(A) is a J -eigenvalue of A. We de\u00ad ne the geometric multiplicity\nof \u00b6 to be dimKer(A \u00a1 zJ). Clearly, this is the same as dimKer(JA \u00a1 zI) or\ndimKer(AJ \u00a1 zI), which are just the geometric multiplicities of \u00b6 regarded as a\neigenvalue of JA or AJ , respectively. Following the general de\u00ad nition for spectral\npencils (see [4], for example), we can de\u00ad ne the algebraic multiplicity of \u00b6 to be\nthe sum of the lengths of a canonical set of Jordan chains corresponding to \u00b6 . It\nis straightforward to see that this is just the algebraic multiplicity of \u00b6 regarded\nas an eigenvalue of JA or AJ . We say that \u00b6 is semi-simple if its geometric and\nalgebraic multiplicities are equal.\nNotation. For any p 2 [1;1] and k 2 Z, we shall use Lpk with norm k\u00a2kLpk to denote\nthe usual Sobolev space on R2; here, k is the `number\u2019 of p-integrable derivatives.\nDepending on the context, elements of Lpk will take values in either R, C, R\n2 or\nC2. The omission of k will imply its value is 0. We shall also use Lp1 to denote the\nspace\nT\nk 2 ZL\np\nk (without any topology).\nIn order to de\u00ad ne A as a closed (unbounded) operator, we impose some conditions\non the potentials \u00a9 and A.\n(A1) \u00a9 = \u00a9 0 + \u00a9 1 for some \u00a9 0 2 L 1 and \u00a9 1 2 L1 which has compact support and\nsatis\u00ad es (1 + j\u00b9 j2)k=2 ^\u00a9 1( \u00b9 ) 2 Lp for some p 2 [1;1] and k > 2(1 \u00a1 1=p).\n(A2) A 2 L 1loc \\ L21 loc.\nHenceforth we shall assume these conditions are always satis\u00ad ed. It follows that\nfor any u 2 C 10 the formal operator given by (1.6) de\u00ad nes some Au 2 L2, i.e. (1.6)\nde\u00ad nes an operator on L2 with domain C 10 , which we shall denote by A0. Now\u00b3\nH +P B\n\u00a4\nB H\u00a1P\n\u00b4\n=\n1\n2\n\u00b3\nP\u00a1P+ \u00a1 iP\u00a12\niP +\n2 P+ P\u00a1\n\u00b4\n\u00a1 \u00a9 J = T \u00a4 T \u00a1 \u00a9 J;\nwhere T is the operator given by T = (1=\np\n2)\n\u00a1\niP + P\u00a1\n\u00a2\n. It follows easily that A0\nis symmetric. Furthermore, the quadratic form associated to A0, KA 0 , is given by\nKA 0 (u) = hA0u;ui = kTuk2 + c2kuk2 \u00a1 K \u00a9 (u);\nwhere\nK \u00a9 (u) = h \u00a9 Ju;ui = hu1; \u00a9 u1i \u00a1 hu2; \u00a9 u2i\nfor all u 2 C 10 . In x 4 we shall prove the following.\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1069\nProposition 2.3. Let \u00b5 > 0. Then there exists a constant C such that the estimate\njK \u00a9 (u)j 6 \u00b5kTuk2 + Ckuk2 holds for all u 2 C 10 .\nTherefore, KA0 and hence A0 are semi-bounded. From standard results (see x 10.3\nin [1], for example), it follows that A0 has a self-adjoint extension (the Friedrichs\nextension), which we shall denote by A. Furthermore, C 10 \u00bb DomA \u00bb L2 and\nthe quadratic form associated to A, KA, is the closure of KA 0 . More precisely,\nC 10 \u00bb DomA \u00bb DomKA \u00bb L2,\nDomKA is the closure of C 10 with respect to the norm (kTuk2 + kuk2)1=2 (2.2)\nand, for all u 2 DomKA,\nKA(u) = kTuk2 + c2kuk2 \u00a1 K \u00a9 (u); K \u00a9 (u) = hu1; \u00a9 u1i \u00a1 hu2; \u00a9 u2i: (2.3)\nConditions A1 and A2 thus allow us to de\u00ad ne A as a self-adjoint operator. Since\n(AJ) \u00a4 = J \u00a4 A \u00a4 = JA and \u00bc J(A) = \u00bc (JA) = \u00bc (AJ) (see remark 2.2), we imme-\ndiately have that \u00bc J (A) is symmetric about the real axis. However, the operators\nJA and AJ are not self-adjoint (or even normal) so, in general, \u00bc J(A) will contain\nnon-real points and non-semi-simple eigenvalues. There are several extra conditions\nwe can impose on \u00a9 and\/or A that allow us to proceed further. The next result\ngives one such approach (essentially the approach used in [3]).\nTheorem 2.4. Suppose there exists \u00af > 0 such that\njK \u00a9 (u)j 6 kTuk2 + (c2 \u00a1 \u00af )kuk2 (2.4)\nfor all u 2 C 10 (note that, in particular, this is satis\u00afed if k \u00a9 kL1 6 c2 \u00a1 \u00af ). Then\n\u00bc J(A) \u00b3 ( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 \u00af ] [ [ \u00af ;1) and contains no non-semi-simple J-eigenvalues.\nProof. Using (2.2), it immediately follows that (2.4) holds for all u 2 DomKA \u00bc\nDomA. Thus, for all u 2 DomA,\nhAu;ui = kTuk2 + c2kuk2 \u00a1 K \u00a9 (u) > \u00af kuk2;\nand so A > \u00af I . Therefore, A has a boundedly invertible positive self-adjoint square\nroot A1=2, which allows us to rewrite the spectral problem given by (1.5) as\n(I \u00a1 zA\u00a11=2JA\u00a11=2)v = 0:\nIt follows that \u00bc J(A) = fz j 1=z 2 \u00bc (A\u00a11=2JA\u00a11=2)g. However, A\u00a11=2JA\u00a11=2\nis a self-adjoint operator bounded by 1=\u00af , so \u00bc (A\u00a11=2JA\u00a11=2) \u00b3 [\u00a1 1=\u00af ; 1=\u00af ] and\ncontains no non-semi-simple eigenvalues. The result then follows.\nSome other conditions that allow us to obtain useful results about \u00bc J (A) are as\nfollows.\n(B1) In addition to the requirements imposed by condition A1, we assume that\n\u00a9 0 2 L 1 \\ L21 loc, \u00a9 0(x) ! 0 as jxj ! 1 and, if p = 1, then j\u00b9 j2 ^\u00a9 1( \u00b9 )! 0\nas j \u00b9 j ! 1,\n(B2) In addition to the requirements imposed by condition A2, we assume there\nexists a disc Bn \u00bb R2 of radius rn for each n 2 N such that rn ! 1 and\nk \u00a9 kL2(Bn); kHkL2(Bn) = o(rn) as n!1 (where H is de\u00ad ned in (1.4)).\n1070 D. M. Elton\n(C) \u00a9 and A are smooth with values and derivatives of all orders bounded (in the\nL 1 norm). Furthermore, \u00a9 and H decay at in\u00ad nity.\nRemark 2.5. Condition A1 forces \u00a9 1 2 Lp for all p 2 [1;1); however, \u00a9 1 =2 L 1\nin general (unless p = 1, in which case \u00a9 1 must be continuous). The same is true\nfor condition B1.\nExamples of functions \u00a9 1 satisfying condition A1 but not the last part of condi-\ntion B1 include \u00a9 1(x) = \u00bf (x) log(jxj) and \u00a9 1(x) = \u00bf (x)H(x1)H(x2), where \u00bf 2 C 10\nis some cut-o\u00ac function with \u00bf (0) 6= 0 and H : R ! R is the Heaviside function.\nSince kfkL2(Bn) 6\np\n\u00ba rnkfkL1 (Bn) for any function f , it is enough to have that\nk \u00a9 kL1 (Bn); kHkL1 (Bn) ! 0 in condition B2 (see remark 5.10 for further technical\ndetails regarding this condition).\nClearly, condition C implies conditions B1 and B2, while all of the above condi-\ntions are satis\u00ad ed if \u00a9 and A are Schwartz class functions.\n3. Main results\nOur main result concerning the J -essential spectrum of A is the following.\nTheorem 3.1. If \u00a9 satis\u00afes condition B1, then \u00bc J Es s (A) \u00b3 ( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 c2] [ [c2;1).\nFurthermore, \u00bc J(A) n \u00bc J Es s (A) consists of isolated J-eigenvalues of \u00afnite algebraic\n(and hence geometric) multiplicity.\nIf \u00a9 and A satisfy condition B2, then \u00bc J Es s (A) \u00b4 ( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 c2] [ [c2;1).\nThis result was proved in [3] under the assumptions that \u00a9 and A are smooth,\ntheir values and derivatives of all orders vanish at in\u00ad nity and k \u00a9 kL1 < c2.\nIt is natural to compare the spectral properties of our equation (1.1) with those\nof the Dirac equation. Using atomic units, the stationary form of Dirac\u2019s equation\nin R2 can be written as\n(D \u00a1 \u00b6 I)\u00c1 = 0;\nwhere\nD =\n\u00b3 \u00a1 \u00a9 + c2 cP\u00a1\ncP + \u00a1 \u00a9 \u00a1 c2\n\u00b4\n; (3.1)\n\u00b6 is the spectral parameter and \u00c1 is a spinor (i.e. a function from R2 into C2).\nAssuming \u00a9 and A satisfy conditions B1 and B2, it is possible to de\u00ad ne D as a\nself-adjoint operator on a dense domain in L2 and show that\n\u00bc Es s (D) = ( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 c2] [ [c2;1)\n(see [9], for example). Thus the essential spectra of the operators A and D coincide.\nIf we assume that \u00a9 and A satisfy condition C, we can also compare the discrete\nspectra of these operators in the gap ( \u00a1 c2; c2). To do this, it is easiest to compare\nboth operators to the Pauli operator H +P (after we have shifted the former spectra\nby \u00a1 c2 to allow for the rest mass of the electron). For the Dirac operator, we have\nthe following result (see [6] or [9]).\nTheorem 3.2. Let \u00b6 < 0 be an eigenvalue of Pauli\u2019s operator H +P with multiplicity\nk and let fv1; : : : ; vkg be an orthonormal basis for the corresponding eigenspace.\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1071\nThen, for all su\u00b1 ciently large c, there exist k (not necessarily distinct) isolated\neigenvalues \u00b6 1(c); : : : ; \u00b6 k(c) in \u00bc (D) which admit the asymptotic expansion\n\u00b6 i(c) = c\n2 + \u00b6 \u00a1 \u00b7 ic\u00a12 + O(c\u00a14); i = 1; : : : ; k;\nwhere \u00b7 1; : : : ; \u00b7 k are the (repeated) eigenvalues of the k \u00a3 k matrix with entries\nhvi; 14P\u00a1( \u00a9 + \u00b6 )P + vji for i; j = 1; : : : ; k. Furthermore, there exists a c-independent\nneighbourhood U of 0 such that these are the only points of \u00bc (D) \\ (c2 + U ).\nWe establish a similar result for the operator A (note that if c2 > k \u00a9 kL1 , then\ntheorem 2.4 shows that all J -eigenvalues of A are real and semi-simple).\nTheorem 3.3. Let \u00b6 < 0 be an eigenvalue of Pauli\u2019s operator H +P with multiplicity\nk and let fv1; : : : ; vkg be an orthonormal basis for the corresponding eigenspace.\nThen, for all su\u00b1 ciently large c, there exist k (not necessarily distinct) isolated\nJ-eigenvalues \u00b6 1(c); : : : ; \u00b6 k(c) in \u00bc J (A) which admit the asymptotic expansion\n\u00b6 i(c) = c\n2 + \u00b6 \u00a1 \u00b7 ic\u00a12 + O(c\u00a14); i = 1; : : : ; k;\nwhere \u00b7 1; : : : ; \u00b7 k are the (repeated) eigenvalues of the k \u00a3 k matrix with entries\nhvi; 12B \u00a4 Bvji for i; j = 1; : : : ; k. Furthermore, there exists a c-independent neigh-\nbourhood U of 0 such that these are the only points of \u00bc J (A) \\ (c2 + U).\nTherefore, the discrete spectrum of A agrees with that of the Dirac operator to\na relative accuracy of O(c\u00a14), although we cannot expect to better than this in\ngeneral.\nRemark 3.4. The operator (3.1) is the Dirac operator corresponding to `spin-up\nelectrons\u2019 in R2; it is also possible to consider the Dirac operator corresponding to\n`spin-down electrons\u2019,\nD =\n\u00b3 \u00a1 \u00a9 + c2 cP+\ncP\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a9 \u00a1 c2\n\u00b4\n:\nIn this case, comparison should be made with the operator similar to A obtained\nby taking the lower sign in (1.2) (and an appropriately modi\u00ad ed Pauli operator).\nMaking the appropriate basic changes, it is also possible to compare points of\nthe discrete spectra of A and D just above \u00a1 c2 (i.e. when dealing with positrons);\nthe spectra have to be shifted by c2 and comparison made to positive eigenvalues\nof the Pauli operator \u00a1 H\u00a1P .\n4. Some technical results\nIn this section we deal with some technical results that are needed for the proofs\nof proposition 2.3 and the \u00ad rst part of theorem 3.1; the former is given at the end\nof this section and the later in the next section.\nDe\u00ad ne a function \u00a4 on R2 by \u00a4 ( \u00b9 ) = (1 + j\u00b9 j2)1=2 and let T0 be the operator\nde\u00ad ned in the same way as T except with A = 0, i.e. T0 = (1=\np\n2)\n\u00a1\n@ + \u00a1 i@\u00a1\n\u00a2\n.\nAlso, throughout this section, let \u00a9 1, p and k be as given by condition A1.\nLet u 2 C 10 .

We have j ^\u00a9 1( \u00b9 \u00a1 \u00b2 )ja( \u00b9 ; \u00b2 ) = j ^\u00a9 1( \u00b2 \u00a1 \u00b9 )ja( \u00b2 ; \u00b9 ) (note that \u00a9 1 is real valued,\nso j ^\u00a9 1j is symmetric about 0).

Now the functions \u00bc and \u00a4\n\u00a11=4 decay at in\u00ad nity\nwhile \u00bf 2 C 10 . It follows that the operators \u00bc ( \u00a1 i@)( \u00bf \u00a2 ) and \u00a4 \u00a11=4( \u00a1 i@)( \u00bf \u00a2 ) are\ncompact on L2 (see Appendix 2 to xXI.3 of [8] for example).

It follows that the conditions for (5.4) and (5.5) are\nsatis\u00ad ed. We also have kF ( \u00bf u)k 6 kuk by (4.2) and (4.7). Combining these obser-\nvations with (5.1){(5.5), we then get\njK \u00a9 1(u)j 6 C2 \u00af kuk2 + C3kuk( \u00af kuk+ 2\u00af kT0( \u00bf u)k)\n6 (C2 + 2C3) \u00af kuk2 + C3 \u00af kT0( \u00bf u)k2:\nEstimate (4.7), together with the de\u00ad nition of \u00af , then completes the result.\nWe now extend the previous result to deal with \u00a9 (rather than just \u00a9 1).\nLemma 5.2. Suppose \u00a9 satis\u00afes condition B1.

If \u00aa 2 L21 loc and supp( \u00aa ) is compact, then \u00a4 ^\u00aa 2 L2. It follows that we\ncan write \u00a9 0 = \u00a9\n0\n0 + \u00a9\n0\n1, where \u00a9\n0\n0 and \u00a9\n0\n1 satisfy condition B1 (with p = 2) and\nk \u00a9 00kL1 < 13\". Hence\njK \u00a9 00(u)j 6 13\"kuk2 6 13\"(kTuk2 + kuk2)\n1076 D. M. Elton\nfor all u 2 C 10 . On the other hand, lemma 5.1 gives us a \u00ad nite-dimensional vector\nspace L \u00bb C 10 such that\njK \u00a9 1 (u)j; jK \u00a9 01 (u)j 6 13\"(kTuk2 + kuk2)\nfor all u 2 L? \\ C 10 . However, K \u00a9 (u) = K \u00a9 00 (u) + K \u00a9 1(u) + K \u00a9 01(u), which,\ncombined with (2.2), now completes the result.\nProposition 5.3. Let z 2 C n (( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 c2] [ [c2;1)) and suppose \u00a9 satis\u00afes con-\ndition B1. Then Ker(A \u00a1 zJ) is \u00afnite dimensional and Ran(A \u00a1 zJ) is closed.\nProof. Write z = x+iy, where x; y 2 R. Firstly, suppose y = 0 (so z = x 2 ( \u00a1 c2; c2))\nand set \u00af = dist(x; f\u00a1 c2; c2g) > 0. It follows that, for all u 2 DomA,\nKA(u) \u00a1 hzJu;ui = kTuk2 + c2kuk2 \u00a1 xhJu;ui \u00a1 K \u00a9 (u)\n> kTuk2 + \u00af kuk2 \u00a1 K \u00a9 (u):\nHence we can choose \" > 0 so that\njKA(u) \u00a1 hzJu;uij > \"kTuk2 + 2\"kuk2 \u00a1 jK \u00a9 (u)j:\nNow suppose y 6= 0 and set w = x(x2 + y2)\u00a11=2. Therefore, jwj < 1, which implies\n\u00af = (1 \u00a1 w2)1=2 > 0. Let u 2 DomA and set d = kTuk2 + c2kuk2. Then\njkTuk2 + c2kuk2 \u00a1 hzJu;uij2\n= \u00af 2d2 + w2d2 \u00a1 2w(x2 + y2)1=2dhJu;ui+ (x2 + y2)hJu;ui2 > \u00af 2d2:\nIt follows that, for all u 2 DomA,\njKA(u) \u00a1 hzJu;uij > \u00af (kTuk2 + c2kuk2) \u00a1 jK \u00a9 (u)j\n> \"kTuk2 + 2\"kuk2 \u00a1 jK \u00a9 (u)j\nfor some suitably chosen \" > 0. By recombining the two cases (i.e. when y = 0\nand y 6= 0) and applying lemma 5.2, we can now \u00ad nd a \u00ad nite-dimensional subspace\nL \u00bb C 10 such that, for all u 2 L? \\ DomA, we have\njh(A \u00a1 zJ)u;uij = jKA(u) \u00a1 hzJu;uij > \"kuk2 ) k(A \u00a1 zJ)uk > \"kuk:\n(5.6)\nNow suppose we have a sequence satisfying\nfuigi2 N\u00bb DomA; kuik = 1; (A \u00a1 zJ)ui ! 0: (5.7)\nWrite ui = u\n0\ni + u\n1\ni , where u\n0\ni 2 L and u1i 2 L?. Thus u0i 2 C 10 \u00bb DomA\nand so u1i 2 DomA as well. Now fu0i gi2 N is a bounded sequence in the \u00ad nite-\ndimensional space L, so it contains a convergent subsequence fu0i(j)gj 2 N. However,\nA \u00a1 zJ is bounded on L (as L \u00bb DomA is \u00ad nite dimensional), so (5.7) implies\nthat f(A\u00a1 zJ)u1i(j)gj 2 N is convergent and hence Cauchy. Since u1i(j) 2 L? \\ DomA,\nequation (5.6) then implies that fu1i(j)gj 2 N is also Cauchy and hence convergent.\nBy adding fu0i(j)gj 2 N and fu1i(j)gj 2 N, it follows that we can \u00ad nd a convergent subse-\nquence of any sequence satisfying (5.7). A standard argument (see theorems IV.5.10\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1077\nand IV.5.11 in [7], for example) shows that this implies that A \u00a1 zJ has a \u00ad nite-\ndimensional kernel and a closed range.\nThe next two results are needed to help control the behaviour of the non-real\npart of \u00bc J(A). To do this, we will need to consider the standard spectral problem\nassociated to the (self-adjoint) operator A.\nProposition 5.4. Suppose \u00a9 satis\u00afes condition B1 and let \u00af > 0. Then the spectral\nsubspace of A corresponding to ( \u00a1 1; c2 \u00a1 \u00af ] \\ \u00bc (A) is \u00afnite dimensional.\nProof. Let x = c2 \u00a1 \u00af and \" = minf1; 1\n2\n\u00af g > 0. Therefore, for all u 2 DomA,\nKA(u) \u00a1 xkuk2 = kTuk2 + c2kuk2 \u00a1 xkuk2 \u00a1 K \u00a9 (u)\n> \"kTuk2 + 2\"kuk2 \u00a1 K \u00a9 (u):\nBy applying lemma 5.2, it follows that we can \u00ad nd a \u00ad nite-dimensional subspace\nL \u00bb C 10 such that\nh(A \u00a1 xI)u;ui = KA(u) \u00a1 xkuk2 > \"kuk2\nfor all u 2 L? \\ DomA. Therefore, the spectral subspace of A corresponding to\n( \u00a1 1; x] \\ \u00bc (A) has dimension at most dimL.\nProposition 5.5. There can be at most \u00afnitely many non-real J-eigenvalues in\n\u00bc J(A).\nProof. Let Q\u00a1 and Q + be the (self-adjoint) spectral projections of A corresponding\nto ( \u00a1 1; 0)\\ \u00bc (A) and [0;+1)\\ \u00bc (A), respectively. Therefore, \u00a7Q\u00a7AQ\u00a7 > 0, and\nso we can de\u00ad ne non-negative self-adjoint operators by B\u00a7 = (\u00a7Q\u00a7AQ\u00a7)1=2. De\u00ad ne\nfurther operators by Q = Q + \u00a1 Q\u00a1 and B = B + \u00a1 B\u00a1. A straightforward calculation\ngives\nBQB = A: (5.8)\nSuppose fzi j i 2 Ig is a \u00ad nite set of non-real J -eigenvalues of A such that\nfzi; \u00b7zi j i 2 Ig is a set of 2jIj distinct points. Choose 0 6= ui 2 Ker(A \u00a1 ziJ) for each\ni 2 I and set vi = Bui. De\u00ad ne L and L0 to be the linear spans of fui j i 2 Ig and\nfvi j i 2 Ig, respectively. Since the ui are eigenvectors of the operator JA corre-\nsponding to distinct eigenvalues, the set fui j i 2 Ig must be linearly independent.\nTherefore, dimL = jI j.\nClaim. dimL0 6 dimQ\u00a1. Suppose v 2 KerQ\u00a1 for some v =\nP\ni 2 I \u00b6 ivi, where\n\u00b6 i 2 C for each i 2 I. Since Q + +Q\u00a1 = I and hv;Q\u00a1vi = 0, we have\nkvk2 = hv; (Q + +Q\u00a1)vi\n= hv; (Q + \u00a1 Q\u00a1)vi\n=\nX\ni;j 2 I\n\u00b6 i\u00b7\u00b6 jhBui;QBuji\n=\nX\ni;j 2 I\n\u00b6 i\u00b7\u00b6 jhui;Auji (5.9)\n1078 D. M. Elton\nby (5.8) and the self-adjointness of B. Now A is self-adjoint and Aui = ziJui for\neach i 2 I. Therefore,\nzihJui;uji = hAui;uji = hui;Auji = \u00b7zjhui; Juji:\nHowever, J is also self-adjoint while zi 6= \u00b7zj for any i; j 2 I. Thus hui;Auji = 0,\nand so kvk = 0 by (5.9). It follows that the projection Q\u00a1 restricted to L0 has a\ntrivial kernel. Hence dimL0 6 dimRanQ\u00a1 = dimQ\u00a1.\nNow suppose that Bu = 0 for some u 2 L. Since A = BQB (by (5.8)), we have\nu 2 KerA; that is, the kernel of the restriction BjL : L! L0 is contained in KerA.\nSince L and L0 are \u00ad nite dimensional and BjL : L! L0 is surjective, we thus get\njI j = dimL\n= dimL0 + dimKerBjL\n6 dimQ\u00a1 + dimKerA;\nwhere the inequality follows with the help of the claim. However, dimQ\u00a1 and\ndimKerA are both \u00ad nite by proposition 5.4. The result now follows.\nRemark 5.6. We can de\u00ad ne an inde\u00afnite inner product on L2 by the expression\nhu;vi Q = hu;Qvi:\nThe pair (L2; h\u00a2; \u00a2i Q ) is then a Pontrjagin space (i.e. a Krein space with a \u00ad nite rank\nof inde\u00ad niteness (see [2], for example)). In this setting, the operator\nA Q = (B + + B\u00a1)J(B + \u00a1 B\u00a1)\nis self-adjoint (note that (B + + B\u00a1)Q = (B + \u00a1 B\u00a1) = Q(B + + B\u00a1)). Furthermore,\nthe (standard) spectrum of A Q and the J -spectrum of A agree, modulo special\nconsideration of the point 0. Proposition 5.5 now follows from a simpli\u00ad ed form\nof a general result (see theorems IX.4.3 and IX.4.6 in [2]; the relevant part of the\nproofs of these results forms the basis for the proof of proposition 5.5). Using the\nfull generality of this result, we can show that sum of the algebraic multiplicities\nof all the non-real and non-semi-simple J -eigenvalues of A is at most 2m + 1, m\nbeing the dimension of the spectral subspace of A corresponding to ( \u00a1 1; 0]\\ \u00bc (A)\n(which is \u00ad nite by proposition 5.4).\nProof of the \u00afrst part of theorem 3.1. Let \u00a7 = Cn(( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 c2][[c2;1)) and choose\nz 2 \u00a7 . By proposition 5.3, we immediately have that Ker(A \u00a1 zJ) is \u00ad nite dimen-\nsional and Ran(A\u00a1 zJ) is closed. It follows (see theorem IV.5.13 of [7], for example)\nthat\nRan(A \u00a1 zJ) = (Ker(A \u00a1 zJ) \u00a4 )?:\nHowever, (A \u00a1 zJ) \u00a4 = A \u00a1 \u00b7zJ and \u00b7z 2 \u00a7 , so Ker(A \u00a1 zJ) \u00a4 must also be \u00ad nite\ndimensional by proposition 5.3. Thus A \u00a1 zJ is Fredholm, and so z =2 \u00bc J Es s (A) by\nde\u00ad nition. Furthermore,\nIndex(A \u00a1 zJ) = dimKer(A \u00a1 zJ) \u00a1 dimKer(A \u00a1 \u00b7zJ):\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1079\nNow let \u00a7 0 = C n \u00bc J Es s (A) \u00b4 \u00a7 . Therefore, \u00a7 0 is connected. Using standard\nstability theorems for Fredholm operators (in particular, see theorem IV.5.31 of [7]),\nit follows that Index(A \u00a1 zJ) is constant on \u00a7 0 while dimKer(A \u00a1 zJ) is constant\non \u00a7 0 n M where M is a (possibly empty) set of isolated points in \u00a7 0. On the\nother hand, proposition 5.5 implies dimKer(A \u00a1 zJ) = 0 for all but a \u00ad nite number\nof z 2 \u00a7 0 n R. It follows that Index(A \u00a1 zJ) = 0 = dimKer(A \u00a1 zJ) for all\nz 2 \u00a7 0 nM , and so \u00bc J(A) n \u00bc J Es s (A) \u00b3 M . Finally, let z 2 \u00bc J(A)n \u00bc J Es s (A). Thus\nJA \u00a1 zI = J(A \u00a1 zJ) is Fredholm and so z must be an eigenvalue of JA of \u00ad nite\nalgebraic multiplicity by theorem IV.5.28 in [7]. From remark 2.2, it follows that z\nis a J -eigenvalue of A of \u00ad nite algebraic multiplicity.\nFor the remainder of this section, we will use A0 to denote the operator de\u00ad ned as\nfor A except with \u00a9 = 0 andA = 0. Thus A0 = T \u00a40 T0+c2I, where T0 is the operator\nde\u00ad ned at the beginning of x 4. We will prove the second part of theorem 3.1 by\nusing Weyl\u2019s criterion (i.e. by constructing a sequence of approximate eigenvectors);\nthe next result essentially does this for A0.\nProposition 5.7. Suppose \u00b6 2 ( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 c2][ [c2;1) and we have a disc B \u00bb R2 of\nradius r > 12 . Then we can \u00afnd 0 6= v 2 C 10 with supp(v) \u00b3 B such that\nk(A0 \u00a1 \u00b6 J)vk 6 C1kvk=r and kvkL11 6 C2kvk=r\nfor some constants C1 and C2 that are independent of B and r.\nProof. Since the operator A0 and all the norms appearing in the statement of the\nproposition are translation invariant, it su\u00af ces to prove the result assuming that\nB is centred at 0.\nLet \u00b9 2 R2, de\u00ad ne \u00b9 \u00a2 x = x1 \u00b9 1 + x2 \u00b9 2 for all x 2 R2 and de\u00ad ne a function w by\nw(x) = aei \u00b9 \u00a2x for some constant vector a. Thus (A0 \u00a1 \u00b6 J)w(x) = Maei\u00b9 \u00a2x, where\nM is the constant matrix\nM =\n1\n2\n\u00b3j \u00b9 j2 \u00a1 i\u00b9 2\u00a1\ni\u00b9 2+ j\u00b9 j2\n\u00b4\n+\n\u00b3\nc2 \u00a1 \u00b6 0\n0 c2 + \u00b6\n\u00b4\n:\nNow det(M ) = c4 \u00a1 \u00b6 2 + c2j \u00b9 j2. Since \u00b6 2 > c4 by assumption, we can choose \u00b9\nso that det(M ) = 0. Choosing a to be a non-zero null-vector of M , we thus have\n(A0 \u00a1 \u00b6 J)w = 0.\nLet \u00bf 2 C 10 be a non-zero function with supp( \u00bf ) \u00b3 fjxj 6 1g \u00bb R2 and de\u00ad ne\n\u00bf B 2 C 10 by \u00bf B(x) = \u00bf (x=r).

Applying these equations\nagain, we also have\nkvkL11 6 C5k \u00bf BkL11 kwkL11 (B) 6 C6kvk=r\nfor some more constants C5 and C6.\nBefore generalizing the previous result to the operator A, we must consider a\ntechnical complication that arises in dealing with A (essentially relating to the fact\nthat condition B2 places some decay requirements on H but not on A). The next\nlemma addresses this issue but before stating it we make the following observation.\nRemark 5.8. Suppose B \u00b3 R2 is a disc of radius r > 1 and g 2 L2loc. By taking\na suitable periodic extension of g and using Fourier series, it is possible to \u00ad nd\nf 2 L22loc such that \u00a2f = g on B. Furthermore, by using a scaling argument, it\nis possible to ensure that kfkL22(B) 6 C1r2kgkL2(B) for some constant C1 that is\nindependent of B.\nLemma 5.9. Suppose A 2 L21loc, let B1 \u00bb R2 be a disc of radius r > 1 and de\u00afne\nB0 to be the disc with the same centre and a radius of\n1\n2r.

We have @1A1+@2A2, H 2 L2loc, so, using remark 5.8, we can \u00ad nd f; h 2 L22loc\nthat satisfy the identities \u00a2f = @1A1 + @2A2 and \u00a2h = H on B1 and the norm\nestimate\nkhkL22(B1) 6 C1r2kHkL2(B1): (5.12)\nNow set A0 = A \u00a1 (@1f; @2f ) \u00a1 ( \u00a1 @2h; @1h) 2 L21loc.

Now\nlet \u00bc 2 C 10 be a cut-o\u00ac function equal to 1 on B0 and with supp( \u00bc ) \u00b3 B1. Set\n\u00c1 = \u00bc (f+g). Clearly, \u00c1 2 L22, whileA \u00a1 (@1\u00c1; @2\u00c1) = ( \u00a1 @2h; @1h) on B0. The norm\nestimate (5.12) immediately gives kAi \u00a1 @i\u00c1kL21(B0) 6 C1r2kHkL2(B1) for i = 1; 2.\nSince C 10 is dense in L22, we can \u00ad nd \u00bf 2 C 10 with k \u00bf \u00a1 \u00c1kL22 < \", completing the\nproof.\nRemark 5.10. Referring to condition B2, we may assume that the Bn are mutually\ndisjoint (by choosing subsets of a subsequence of fBngn 2 N if necessary). Now take\na \u00ad xed R > 0. Thus, for all su\u00af ciently large n, the disc Bn contains O(r\n2\nn) disjoint\ndiscs of radius R. Since\nR\nBn\njH j2 = o(r2n), it follows that, for all su\u00af ciently large\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1081\nn, we can \u00ad nd a disc Bn;R \u00b3 Bn of radius R such that\nR\nBn;R\njH j2 6 R\u00a14. Since a\nsimilar argument clearly applies to \u00a9 , we can thus replace condition B2 with the\nfollowing condition.\n(B20) In addition to the requirements imposed by condition A2, we assume there\nexists a sequence fBngn 2 N of disjoint discs such that, for each n 2 N, the\nradius of Bn is n and k \u00a9 kL2(Bn); kHkL2(Bn) 6 n\u00a12.\nProof of the second part of theorem 3.1. Choose \u00b6 2 ( \u00a1 1; \u00a1 c2] [ [c2;1) and let\nfBngn2 N be the sequence of balls given by condition B20. For each n 2 N, let B0n\ndenote the disc with the same centre as Bn, but with a radius of\n1\n2n. Let vn be the\nfunction given by proposition 5.7 for the disc B0n and, using lemma 5.9, choose a\n\u00bf n 2 C 10 that satis\u00ad es\nkAi \u00a1 @i \u00bf nkL21(B 0n) 6 C1n2kHkL2(Bn) + 1;\nfor i = 1; 2. Finally, de\u00ad ne a function un 2 C 10 \u00b3 DomA by\nun(x) = e\n\u00a1i\u00bf n(x)vn(x):\nClearly, supp(un) \u00b3 B0n \u00bb Bn, so the set fun j n 2 Ng is linearly independent\n(since the Bn are mutually disjoint). The result will therefore follow if we can show\nk(A \u00a1 \u00b6 J)unk=kunk ! 0 as n !1.\nLet n 2 N. Thus\nk \u00a9 Junk = k \u00a9 Jvnk 6 C2k \u00a9 kL2(Bn)kvnkL1 6 C3k \u00a9 kL2(Bn)kunk=n\nfor some constants C2 and C3. On the other hand,\nP\u00a7un = e\u00a1i\u00bf n(x)( \u00a1 i@\u00a7 + (A\u00a7 \u00a1 @\u00a7 \u00bf n))vn;\nso\nkT \u00a4 Tun \u00a1 e\u00a1i \u00bf n(x)T0 \u00a4 T0vnk 6 C4\nX\ni = 1;2\nkAi \u00a1 @i \u00bf nkL21(B 0n)kvnkL11\n6 C5(n2kHkL2(Bi) + 1)kunk=n\nfor some constants C4 and C5.

Condition B2\n0 now completes the proof.\n6. Stability of isolated eigenvalues\nThe proof of theorem 3.3 will employ the method of asymptotic perturbation theory,\nas developed in chapter VIII of [7].\nBefore beginning with results, we introduce some new notation that will be used\nthroughout the next two sections. For c > 0, we de\u00ad ne Ac to be the shifted operator\nAc = A \u00a1 c2J . Thus \u00bc J (Ac) = \u00bc J(A) \u00a1 c2, and so direct comparison can now be\nmade with the eigenvalues of the Pauli operator H +P .\n1082 D. M. Elton\nFor z 2 C n \u00bc J(Ac), let Rc(z) = (Ac \u00a1 zJ)\u00a11 be the `resolvent\u2019 of Ac. Also, for\nz 2 C n \u00bc (H +P ), set\nR(z) =\n\u00b3\nR(z) 0\n0 0\n\u00b4\nand ~Rc(z) =\n\u00b3\nR(z) 0\n0 1\n2\nc\u00a12\n\u00b4\n; (6.1)\nwhere R(z) = (H +P \u00a1 z)\u00a11 is the resolvent of Pauli\u2019s operator. We will use N c to\ndenote the constant matrix operator given by\nN c =\n\u00b3\n1 0\n0 c\u00a11\n\u00b4\n:\nOperators denoted by some form of the letter Q will be (essentially) projections.\nFor such operators, we will use dimQ to denote the dimension of the range.\nThe \u00ad rst lemma allows us to assume extra regularity conditions in the statement\nand proofs of some subsequent results.\nLemma 6.1. The set C 10 is a core of Ac.\nProof. It is su\u00af cient to prove that T \u00a4 T is essentially self-adjoint on C 10 (note that\nAc = T \u00a4 T + \u00a9 J + c2(I \u00a1 J) and \u00a9 J + c2(I \u00a1 J) is bounded by condition C). This\nis equivalent to showing that if v 2 L2, then\nT \u00a4 Tv = \u00a7iv (6.2)\nimplies v = 0. Here, we initially de\u00ad ne Tv and T \u00a4 Tv as elements of L2\u00a11 and L2\u00a12,\nrespectively. Setting w = Tv 2 L2\u00a11, equation (6.2) implies\nT \u00a4 w = \u00a1 1p\n2\n\u00b3\n@\u00a1\ni@ +\n\u00b4\nw +\n1p\n2\n\u00b3 \u00a1 iA\u00a1\nA +\n\u00b4\nw 2 L2: (6.3)\nHowever, we have\n\u00a1 \u00a1 iA\u00a1 A + \u00a2T w 2 L2\u00a11 by condition C, so (6.3) implies @\u00a7w 2\nL2\u00a11. It follows that @iw 2 L2\u00a11 for i = 1; 2, which, coupled with the fact that\nw 2 L2\u00a11, gives w 2 L2. Applying the same argument again now gives w = Tv 2 L21.\nTherefore, hT \u00a4 Tv; vi = hw;wi 2 R. It follows from (6.2) that \u00a7ihv; vi 2 R and so\nv = 0.\nThe operators P\u00a7 are \u00ad rst-order elliptic partial-di\u00acerential operators on R2\nwhose coe\u00af cients, together with their derivatives of all orders, are bounded in\nthe L 1 norm (this follows from condition C). Using standard theory (see x 18.1\nof [5], for example), we can hence \u00ad nd pseudo-di\u00acerential operators F1, F2, G1 and\nG2 of orders 0, 0, \u00a1 1 and \u00a1 1, respectively, such that\nP + = F1P\u00a1 + G1 and P\u00a1 = P+ F2 + G2: (6.4)\nFurthermore, we can insist that F1, F2, G1P\u00a7 and P\u00a7G2 are bounded operators on\nL2k for any k; this fact will be used in the proof of the next result.\nProposition 6.2. Let z 2 C and \" > 0. Then there exists a constant C(\"; z),\ndepending continuously on \" and z, such that, for any \u00af 2 [0; 1], c > C(\"; z) and\nu 2 L21 with kN \u00afc (Ac \u00a1 zJ)uk 6 \"kuk, we have k(H +P \u00a1 z)wk 6 5\"kwk, where w\nis de\u00afned by w = u1 \u00a1 iF2u2. Furthermore, w = 0 only if u = 0.\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1083\nWith the help of lemma 6.1, proposition 6.2 (with \u00af = 0) gives the following.\nCorollary 6.3. Suppose z 2 Cn \u00bc (H +P ). Then z =2 \u00bc J(Ac) and kRc(z)k 6 5kR(z)k\nfor all c > C( 15kR(z)k\u00a11; z).\nRemark 6.4. The spectrum of Ac thus converges to that of H +P in the following\nsense: given a compact set K \u00bb C n \u00bc (H +P ), we have K \\ \u00bc J(Ac) = ; for all c > C,\nwhere C is the maximum value of C( 15kR(z)k\u00a11; z) for z 2 K.\nProof of proposition 6.2. Let u 2 L21 and set w = u1 \u00a1 iF2u2. Thus\nkuk 6 kwk+ C1ku2k (6.5)\nfor some constant C1. On the other hand, equation (6.4) allows us to write\n(Ac \u00a1 zJ)u =\n\u00b3\n(H +P \u00a1 z)w\nBw\n\u00b4\n+\n\u00b3\n0\n2c2u2\n\u00b4\n+Mzu2; (6.6)\nwhere Mz is the operator\nMz =\n1\n2\n\u00b3 \u00a1 iP\u00a1\nP +\n\u00b4\nG2 + (z + \u00a9 )\n\u00b3 \u00a1 iF2\n1\n\u00b4\n:\nWe can also write B = iF1(H\n+\nP \u00a1 z)+Nz, with Nz = 12 iG1P + +iF1( \u00a9 +z). Now the\noperators F1, Mz and Nz are all bounded on L\n2. Let C2(z) denote the maximum\nof the corresponding operator norms and 1. Setting C3(\"; z) = minf1; \"g=2C2(z),\nit follows that C3(\"; z) 2 (0; 12 ]. However, on any inner product space we have the\ninequality ka+ bk > \u00b7 (kbk \u00a1 kak) for all \u00b7 2 [\u00a1 1; 1]. It follows that\nkBw + 2c2u2k > C3(\"; z)(2c2ku2k \u00a1 kBwk):\nChoosing any \u00af 2 [0; 1] and c > 1, we then get\nc\u00a1\u00af kBw + 2c2u2k > C3(\"; z)(2cku2k \u00a1 kiF1(H +P \u00a1 z)w +Nzwk)\n> 2C3(\"; z)cku2k \u00a1 12k(H +P \u00a1 z)wk \u00a1 12\"kwk:\nCombining this with (6.6), it follows that\n2kN \u00afc (Ac \u00a1 zJ)uk > 12k(H +P \u00a1 z)wk \u00a1 12\"kwk+ 2(C3(\"; z)c \u00a1 C2(z))ku2k:\nIf we now assume kN \u00afc (Ac \u00a1 zJ)uk 6 \"kuk and use (6.5), we get\n5\"kwk > k(H +P \u00a1 z)wk+ 4(C3(\"; z)c \u00a1 C2(z) \u00a1 \"C1)ku2k:\nTherefore, the result follows if we take C(\"; z) = (C2(z) + \"C1)=C3(\"; z) > 2.\nLet z 2 C n \u00bc (H +P ), so R(z), R(z) and ~Rc(z) are all bounded operators on L2.\nFrom corollary 6.3, it follows that Rc(z) is also a bounded operator on L2 for\nall su\u00af ciently large c. The next result deals with the relationship between these\noperators as c! +1.\nTheorem 6.5. For any z 2 C n \u00bc (H +P ), we have Rc(z)\ns\u00a1! ~Rc(z) (where ` s\u00a1!\u2019 is\nused to denote strong operator convergence as c ! +1). Since ~Rc(z)! R(z) in\noperator norm, it follows that Rc(z) s\u00a1! R(z).\n1084 D. M. Elton\nProof. For u 2 C 10 , we have\n(Rc(z) \u00a1 ~Rc(z))u = \u00a1 Rc(z) N \u00a11c\n\u00b3\nN c(Ac \u00a1 zJ) N c \u00a1\n\u00b3\nH +P \u00a1 z 0\n0 2\n\u00b4\u00b4\nN \u00a11c ~Rc(z)u:\nNow\nN \u00a11c ~Rc(z)u =\n\u00b3\nR(z)u1\n0\n\u00b4\n+\n1\n2c\n\u00b3\n0\nu2\n\u00b4\n;\nR(z)u1 2 L21 by condition C (see proposition 7.2 for more details) and\nN c(Ac \u00a1 zJ) N c \u00a1\n\u00b3\nH +P \u00a1 z 0\n0 2\n\u00b4\n=\n\u00b3\n0 c\u00a11B \u00a4\nc\u00a11B c\u00a12(H\u00a1P + z)\n\u00b4\n:\nIt follows that \u00b3\nN c(Ac \u00a1 zJ) N c \u00a1\n\u00b3\nH +P \u00a1 z 0\n0 2\n\u00b4\u00b4\nN \u00a11c ~Rc(z)u! 0\nas c! +1. On the other hand, Rc(z) N \u00a11c = ( N c(Ac \u00a1 zJ))\u00a11. By proposition 6.2\n(with \u00af = 1), this is uniformly bounded in operator norm for c > C( 15kR(z)k\u00a11; z).\nThus we have (Rc(z) \u00a1 ~Rc(z))u! 0 as c! +1 for any u 2 C 10 . However, C 10 is\ndense in L2, while corollary 6.3 shows that Rc(z) \u00a1 ~Rc(z) is uniformly bounded in\noperator norm for c > C( 1\n5\nkR(z)k\u00a11; z). It follows that Rc(z) \u00a1 ~Rc(z) s\u00a1! 0.\nLet \u00b6 < 0 be an isolated eigenvalue of H +P and let \u00a1 be a simple closed contour\nin C n \u00bc (H +P ) enclosing \u00b6 but no other part of \u00bc (H +P ). Set\nQ = \u00a1 1\n2 \u00ba i\nZ\n\u00a1\nR(z) dz and Q =\n\u00b3\nQ 0\n0 0\n\u00b4\n= \u00a1 1\n2 \u00ba i\nZ\n\u00a1\nR(z) dz:\nThus Q is just the projection onto the eigenspace of H +P associated with \u00b6 . Now, by\nremark 6.4, we know that the contour \u00a1 does not intersect \u00bc J(Ac) for all su\u00af ciently\nlarge c. Hence we can de\u00ad ne an operator Qc by\nQc = \u00a1 1\n2 \u00ba i\nZ\n\u00a1\nRc(z) dz: (6.7)\nRemark 6.6. Owing to the fact that we are dealing with a slightly non-standard\nspectral problem, the operator Qc is not a projection. However, both of the opera-\ntors JQc and QcJ are projections (see remark 2.2 for more details).\nThe next result plays a key role in making the asymptotic perturbation theory\n`work\u2019. The proof is somewhat technical but essentially centres on showing that\nk(Ac \u00a1 \u00b6 J)Qck ! 0 as c! +1.\nProposition 6.7. For all su\u00b1 ciently large c, we have dimQc 6 dimQ.\nProof. Let d\u00b6 = dist( \u00b6 ; \u00bc (H\n+\nP )nf\u00b6 g) > 0 denote the separation of \u00b6 from the rest of\n\u00bc (H +P ). Set \" =\n1\n10\nd\u00b6 , r =\n1\n10\n\" and de\u00ad ne \u00a1 r to be the circular contour centred at \u00b6\nof radius r. Since H +P is self-adjoint and \u00b6 is the closest point of \u00bc (H\n+\nP ) to any point\non \u00a1 r, we immediately get kR(z)k = 1=r for all z 2 \u00a1 r . Now let K be the closure\nSpectral properties of the equation (r + ieA) \u00a3 u = \u00a7mu 1085\nof the region between \u00a1 and \u00a1 r. Therefore, K is compact and K \\ \u00bc (H +P ) = ;, so\nwe can de\u00ad ne a bounded constant C1 by\nC1 = supfC(\"; \u00b6 )g [ fC( 15kR(z)k\u00a11; z) j z 2 Kg\n(where C(\u00a2; \u00a2) is given by proposition 6.2). Now suppose c > C1. Corollary 6.3 then\ngives kRc(z)k 6 5=r for any z 2 \u00a1 r. Corollary 6.3 also impliesK\\ \u00bc J(Ac) = ;. Using\nstandard properties of resolvents and Cauchy\u2019s theorem to deform the contour, we\nthen get\n(Ac \u00a1 \u00b6 J)Qc = \u00a1 1\n2 \u00ba i\nZ\n\u00a1 r\n(z \u00a1 \u00b6 )JRc(z) dz:\nSince kJk = 1, it follows that\nk(Ac \u00a1 \u00b6 J)Qck 6 1\n2\u00ba\nZ\n\u00a1 r\njz \u00a1 \u00b6 j5\nr\ndz 6 5\n2 \u00ba\nj\u00a1 rj = \"\n2\n:\nTherefore, k(Ac \u00a1 \u00b6 J)uk 6 12\"kuk for all u 2 RanQc. By lemma 6.1, we can thus\nchoose a dimQc subspace L of C 10 such that k(Ac \u00a1 \u00b6 J)uk 6 \"kuk for all u 2 L.\nNow let\nL0 = fu1 \u00a1 iF2u2 j u 2 Lg \u00b3 L21 \u00bb DomH +P :\nSince c > C(\"; \u00b6 ), proposition 6.2 (with \u00af = 0) gives us k(H +P \u00a1 \u00b6 )wk 6 5\"kwk for\nall w 2 L0. Since 5\" < d\u00b6 , the minimax principle (see theorem 10.2.3 in [1], for\nexample) applied to the non-negative self-adjoint operator (H +P \u00a1 \u00b6 )2 immediately\ngives us dimL0 6 dimQ. However, the last part of proposition 6.2 also implies\ndimL0 = dimL = dimQc, completing the result.\nTheorem 6.5, combined with the de\u00ad nitions of Qc and Q and the fact that\nkRc(z) \u00a1 R(z)k depends continuously on z 2 \u00a1 for all su\u00af ciently large c, gives\nus Qc s\u00a1! Q. On the other hand, the fact that Ac is self-adjoint can be used to show\nQc = Q \u00a4c . Since JQ = Q = QJ , it follows that the projections JQc and (JQc) \u00a4\nboth converge strongly to Q. By combining this observation with proposition 6.7\nand lemmas VIII.1.23 and VIII.1.24 from [7], we get the following result.\nProposition 6.8. We have dimQc = dimQ = dimQ for all su\u00b1 ciently large c.\nFurthermore, Qc ! Q in operator norm as c! +1.\n7. Asymptotic expansions of isolated eigenvalues\nThe next theorem is based on theorems VIII.2.1 and VIII.2.2 in [7]. It gives an\nasymptotic expansion for the resolvent Rc(z).\nTheorem 7.1.

On the other hand, Rc(z)\ns\u00a1! ~Rc(z) by theorem 6.5. Thus\n(Rc(z) \u00a1 ~Rc(z))( \u00a1 G )Nu = o(c\u00a12[N=2]) and so\nRc(z)u =\nNX\nk = 0\n~Rc(z)( \u00a1 G )ku + o(c\u00a12[N=2]): (7.2)\nThe result now follows from a direct computation using (6.1), (7.1) and (7.2) with\nN = 4.\nThe operator H +P is a \u00ad rst-order perturbation of the Laplacian \u00a2 on R\n2. Further-\nmore, the coe\u00af cients of this perturbation have bounded derivatives of all orders\n(by condition C on \u00a9 and A). Induction and the fact that u 2 L2k, \u00a2u 2 L2k\u00a11\nimplies u 2 L2k + 1 for any k 2 Z now leads to the following result.\nProposition 7.2.

Thus Qu 2 L21 , and so theorem 7.1 gives\nRc(z)Qu\n= R(z)Qu + 12 c\u00a12\n\u00b3\nR(z)B \u00a4 BR(z) \u00a1 R(z)B \u00a4\n\u00a1 BR(z) I\n\u00b4 \u00b3\nQ 0\n0 0\n\u00b4\nu+ O(c\u00a14)zu\n= ( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a11Qu+ 12c\u00a12( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a11\n\u00b3\nR(z)B \u00a4 B 0\n\u00a1 B 0\n\u00b4\nQu +O(c\u00a14)zu (7.4)\nfor any z 2 \u00a1 (note that because Q contains a non-zero entry only in its upper-left\ncorner, the second column of any matrix operator appearing immediately to its\nleft can be chosen arbitrarily). In (7.4), O(c\u00a14)zu denotes an element of L2 such\nthat c4O(c\u00a14)zu is bounded as c ! +1; this bound depends continuously on z\nand u. Now, Q has \u00ad nite rank and \u00a1 is compact so the strong convergence given\nby (7.4) implies convergence in operator norm, while the error term can be bounded\nuniformly on \u00a1 ; that is,\nRc(z)Q = ( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a11Q+ 12c\u00a12( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a11\n\u00b3\nR(z)B \u00a4 B 0\n\u00a1 B 0\n\u00b4\nQ +O(c\u00a14); (7.5)\nwhere O(c\u00a14) denotes an operator with norm of order O(c\u00a14) as c! +1. Now\n\u00a1 1\n2 \u00ba i\nZ\n\u00a1\ndz\n\u00b6 \u00a1 z = 1;\nso the proof can be completed by integrating (7.5) around \u00a1 and using the de\u00ad ni-\ntions of Qc (see (6.7)) and T .\nUsing theorem 7.3, the proof of theorem 3.3 now follows from an argument quite\nsimilar to that used in the second part of the proof of theorem VIII.2.6 in [7]. It\nwill be included here for completeness.\nProof of theorem 3.3. De\u00ad ne (\u00ad nite-dimensional) subspaces of L2 by\nL = RanQ and Lc = RanQc = RanQcJ;\nand de\u00ad ne an operator V c by\nV c = I \u00a1 Q+ QcQ = I + c\u00a12T Q+ O(c\u00a14);\nwhere the second equality follows from theorem 7.3. Since Q is a projection, we\nhave V cQ = QcQ and V c(I \u00a1 Q) = (I \u00a1 Q). Combining these observations with\nproposition 6.8, it follows that V c maps L onto Lc and leaves every element of the\ncomplementary space Ran(I \u00a1 Q) unchanged (for all su\u00af ciently large c). We also\nhave dimL = dimLc, so V c is invertible,\nV \u00a11c = I \u00a1 c\u00a12T Q+O(c\u00a14)\n1088 D. M. Elton\nand V c\u00a11 maps Lc onto L and leaves every element of Ran(I \u00a1 Q) unchanged.\nNow set R0c(z) = V c\u00a11Rc(z)J V cQ. By standard properties of resolvents, Rc(z)J\ncommutes with QcJ , from which it follows that RanR0c(z) \u00b3 L. Therefore,\nR0c(z) = QR0c(z)\n= QV c\u00a11Rc(z)J V cQ\n= (Q+ O(c\u00a14))Rc(z)(Q + c\u00a12JT Q+O(c\u00a14)); (7.6)\nwhere we have used the facts that JQ = Q and QT = 0 (the later being a con-\nsequence of the identity QS = 0). Now B, B \u00a4 and S all map L21 into itself (this\nfollows from condition C for B and B \u00a4 , and from proposition 7.2 and the identity\n(H +P \u00a1 \u00b6 )S = I \u00a1 Q for S). Coupled with the fact that RanQ is a \u00ad nite-dimensional\nsubspace of L21 and the de\u00ad nition of T , it follows that Ran(JT Q) is also a \u00ad nite-\ndimensional subspace of L21 . Since QR(z)JT = R(z)QT = 0, theorem 7.1 now\ngives\nQRc(z)JT Q = QR(z)JT Q+O(c\u00a12) = O(c\u00a12); (7.7)\nwhere O(c\u00a12) denotes an operator with norm of order O(c\u00a12) as c! +1. On the\nother hand, equations (7.3) and (7.5) give\nQRc(z)Q = ( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a11Q+ c\u00a12( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a12QBQ+O(c\u00a14); (7.8)\nwhere\nB = 1\n2\n\u00b3\nB \u00a4 B 0\n0 0\n\u00b4\n(note that because Q contains a non-zero entry only in its upper-left corner, the\nsecond row of any matrix operator appearing immediately to its right can be chosen\narbitrarily). Combining the de\u00ad nition of R0c(z) with (7.6), (7.7) and (7.8), we now\nobtain\nV c\u00a11Rc(z)J V cQ = ( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a11Q+ c\u00a12( \u00b6 \u00a1 z)\u00a12QBQ+ O(c\u00a14)z: (7.9)\nThe remainder term O(c\u00a14)z can be estimated uniformly for z 2 \u00a1 . Furthermore,\nby standard properties of resolvents,\nJAcQcJ = \u00a1 1\n2 \u00ba i\nZ\n\u00a1\nzRc(z)J dz:\nIntegration of (7.9) along \u00a1 after multiplication by \u00a1 z=2 \u00ba i thus gives\nV \u00a11c JAcQcJ V cQ = \u00b6 Q \u00a1 c\u00a12QBQ +O(c\u00a14): (7.10)\nThe earlier remarks about ranges, etc., of V c, etc., means that the left-hand side\nof (7.10) maps L into L. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of this restricted map can\nbe seen to be \u00b6 1; : : : ; \u00b6 k. Standard results about the perturbation of eigenvalues of\n\u00ad nite-dimensional matrices (see, for example, theorem II.5.4 in [7]) now complete\nthe proof of the theorem.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author is grateful to Dmitri Vassiliev for several fruitful discussions of some of\nthe ideas central to this paper.
