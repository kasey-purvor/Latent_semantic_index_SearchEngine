The high\ncost of medicines in relation to disposable income, low\noverall income and lack of health insurance coverage are\ndetermining factors of poor access, together with infre-\nquent availability and poor quality [1]. It is estimated that\nin a number of transition countries and most developing\nnations, more than 80 per cent of pharmaceuticals are\npurchased out-of-pocket through both formal and infor-\nmal means [2,3]. Beyond access to medicines, there are\nsignificant barriers to accessing services, including lack of\navailable infrastructure, lack of diagnostic capabilities,\nand poor transport options, among others.\nChronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a rare, life threaten-\ning condition affecting between one and two people per\n100,000 annually. CML represents 15-20% of all cases of\nadult leukemia in Western societies. Frontline treatment\nof CML involves the use of Imatinib (Glivec\u00ae) (Appendix\n1, Note 1). The beta crystal form of Imatinib has revolu-\ntionized the treatment and continued management of\nCML through precise molecular targeting; it appears to be\nmore effective than Interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) in terms of\ncytogenetic response (CR) and progression-free survival\n(PFS), with fewer side effects for patients in the chronic\nphase [4] and is also cost-effective compared to alternative\ntherapy [5]. Studies have shown that, over a period of 5\nyears, a patient in the accelerated phase of CML will, on\naverage, accrue an additional 2.09 Quality Adjusted Life\nYears (QALYs) with imatinib compared with conven-\ntional therapy, while patients in the blast-crisis phase will\naccrue an additional 0.58 QALYs compared with conven-\ntional therapy [6].\nThe Glivec International Patient Assistance Program\n(GIPAP) is a program set up by a manufacturer (Novartis)\nin partnership with an NGO (The Max Foundation - TMF)\nin collaboration with other NGOs such as the China Char-\nity Foundation and Axios International, to facilitate access\nto and distribution of imatinib directly to patients\nthrough their providers. GIPAP aims to fill the gaps of\nimperfect access to eligible patients in developing coun-\ntries that cannot afford this costly treatment [7]. Under\nthe program, the manufacturer provides the drug at no\ncost directly to eligible patients identified and selected by\nTMF in participating countries. This is not the only global\npartnership that helps provide important medicines to\npeople who cannot afford them in developing countries\n[8,9]. The International Trachoma Initiative (ITI) helps\nthe implementation of plans to eliminate blinding tra-\nchoma [10]. The Mectizan partnership, involving a phar-\nmaceutical manufacturer (MSD), the World Bank,\ngovernments and NGOs was set up in order to provide\nivermectin to patients in developing countries [11]. The\nAccelerated Access Initiative (AAI) involves seven\nresearch-based pharmaceutical manufacturers and five\nUnited Nations partners aiming to provide better access to\nanti-retroviral (ARV) drugs in developing countries; by the\nend of December 2005, more than 716,000 people living\nwith HIV\/AIDS in developing countries were receiving\ntreatment with at least one ARV medicine provided by the\nAAI [12]. The World Health Organization has set up\nguidelines which must be followed in these cases. GIPAP\nalso complies with these guidelines.\nCurrently, 80 countries worldwide take part in GIPAP and\nthe total number of active CML patients benefiting from\nthis initiative reaches 18,000 worldwide. Table 1 shows\nthe breakdown of participating regions and the CML\nactive patients per region.\nIn many participating countries, particularly those in sub-\nSaharan Africa, GIPAP is the only source of available treat-\nment for CML, as there is no state health insurance and\nvery few people can afford private health insurance or the\nout-of-pocket expense to acquire the needed medication.\nAs a result, GIPAP may often cover all patients diagnosed\nwith the condition irrespective of the type of facility they\nare diagnosed in (Appendix 1, Note 2). There are no\nrestrictions in the number of patients eligible for GIPAP in\nTable 1: Geographical distribution of GIPAP active1 participating patients, 2007\nContinent Population2 Number of active CML patients % of population active\nAsia 3,461,233,811 14,927 0.0004%\nAfrica 643,500,700 1,201 0.0002%\nLatin America 371,975,205 1,370 0.0004%\nEurope 245,085,256 509 0.0002%\nOceania 839,000 7 0.0008%\nTotal 4,722,633,972 18,004\nNote: 1 If the number of non-active patients is added, the total number of patients participating in the program reaches 26,532.\n2 Population figures are related to participating countries only.\nSource: The authors from the GIPAP database.Page 2 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:19 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/19any participating country and, as this is a program requir-\ning significant physician input, new patients are enrolled\nas long as a qualified physician assumes responsibility for\nthem. In countries such as Argentina and Chile, the pro-\ngram is supplementary to state insurance coverage, the lat-\nter being limited only to certain population groups (e.g.\ngovernment officials).\nIn order to administer imatinib to eligible patients, the\nmanufacturer identifies the appropriate medical centres\nand physicians and supplies the drug to these centers.\nThese centres have been certified to comply with mini-\nmum services to CML patients. Reports for each patient\nare filled in quarterly by physicians and sent to TMF's\nheadquarters. A requirement for a physician to participate\nin the programme is that s\/he has an internet connection.\nTMF conducts socio-economic evaluations of patients,\nguides physicians through the patient evaluation process,\nand provides emotional support, information and referral\nassistance to patients, their families and care givers. It also\nmonitors patients to support the highest standard of\npatient care, helps identify and qualify eligible medical\ncenters and physicians worldwide, and protects confiden-\ntial patient information and data received during the\nimplementation of the program. A program with such\nbroad geographical expanse cannot work exactly in the\nsame way in all regions or countries. Thus, the operational\nrequirements of GIPAP vary from country to country or\nregion to region.\nWhile GIPAP has been in operation for several years, thus\nfar, assessment of the impact it is having on CML patients\nin developing countries has at best been anecdotal or\nrelied on individual physician opinions [13]. In this paper\nwe aim to, first, identify and discuss the socio-economic\nand demographic characteristics of the patients participat-\ning in GIPAP, and, second, to analyze the impact the pro-\ngram is having on health outcomes of CML-diagnosed\npatients, discuss the determinants of such outcomes and\nwhether there are any variations according to socio-eco-\nnomic, demographic, or geographical criteria. In doing so,\nthe paper also discusses the policy implications regarding\naccess to medicines in developing countries. Section 2 dis-\ncusses the methodology employed in the paper; section 3\npresents and section 4 discusses the results; finally, section\n5 draws the main conclusions.\nData and Methods\nData\nIn order to address the above objectives, we focused on\nCML using data collected by TMF as part of its global remit\nto implement GIPAP. The manufacturer establishes socio-\neconomic criteria modeled on the World Health Organi-\nzation guidelines for charitable donation programs as\nwell as medical criteria determining patient eligibility for\nGIPAP, while TMF reviews patient applications for partic-\nipation in the program and collects data and information\non each patient in the program based on physician\nrecords and assessment. As a result, TMF has exclusive\nresponsibility and oversight in setting up, running and\nmonitoring the program (Appendix 1, Note 3).\nPatient eligibility is determined primarily on the basis of\ndiagnosis as well as income\/socioeconomic status, as fol-\nlows: (a) GIPAP helps patients who are properly diag-\nnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic\nmyeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) and patients with c-Kit\n(CD117)-positive inoperable and\/or metastatic malig-\nnant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) (Appendix\n1, Note 4); and (b) GIPAP provides assistance to patients\nwho are not insured or reimbursed, cannot pay for treat-\nment privately, and live in countries that have minimal\nreimbursement capabilities for their condition. Based on\nthese criteria, it is possible that GIPAP covers all those\ndiagnosed with CML in certain countries because of their\nlow income level.\nData were extracted from the TMF database covering the\nperiod from the beginning of 2005 to the end of 2007 on\na quarterly basis ensuring that all patients had first entered\nin the first quarter of 2005 or later. Thus, the study period\ncomprised 12 quarters. Patients that entered the program\nbefore this date were excluded as the objective was to\nstudy patients from the moment of their entry in the pro-\ngram. The study included 15 countries in the analysis,\nnamely, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Sudan from\nAfrica; Argentina, Chile, El Salvador and Mexico from\nLatin America; Russia and Georgia from Europe; China,\nIndia, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand from Asia. In the\nChinese context, each of China's provinces and municipal\nentities has its own healthcare infrastructure. This necessi-\ntates varying reimbursement schemes for Imatinib,\nincluding shared contribution and co-pay models.\nCountry selection was based on geography, ensuring rep-\nresentation from all continents where the program oper-\nates, the size of eligible population, program penetration\n(percentage of participants in total patient population)\nand health insurance program availability for some seg-\nments of the population. This resulted in the total number\nof patients being 13,568 across the selected countries and\nfor the study period (Appendix 1, Note 5). Of these\npatients there was no information about the initial phase\nfor only 3 patients and no information about the latest\nphase for 20 patients. When taking into account the time\ndimension, the total sample size was N = 66,681 observa-\ntions during the study period 2005-2007. The sample\nincludes the largest GIPAP participant (India), other large\nAsian countries (Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia and China),\ncountries with some health insurance coverage for smallPage 3 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:19 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/19segments of the population, (Russia, Argentina, Chile,\nMexico and Georgia), African countries with large popula-\ntions (South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Sudan) and repre-\nsentative Latin American countries such as Mexico,\nArgentina and El Salvador.\nTMF collects feedback from the participating physicians\nelectronically and on a regular basis; in addition patients\nmust be medically re-approved on average four times per\nyear in order to continue receiving treatment. As a result,\nthe frequency of data is quarterly. If a patient does not\npresent himself for their quarterly review, they are consid-\nered as \"closed\" or non-active, but they can be re-instated\nin the program if contact with them is re-established.\nAside from monitoring eligible patients closely, this also\nenables longitudinal analysis.\nThe patient-related data are sent from local GIPAP partic-\nipating physicians to the central database quarterly. The\ndata are stored in the central system at TMF headquarters\nin Seattle. All data are anonymous and are uniquely iden-\ntified by a code number. The data for this study were\naccessed through the IT services at TMF, by country,\npatient and other demographic characteristics. The unit of\nanalysis is always the patient.\nDependent Variables\nThe variable used as a proxy of patient performance\nwithin GIPAP is a patient's current phase (curphase). Cur-\nrent phase refers to one of the different phases a patient\nmay be in: Blast Crisis, Accelerated, Chronic or Remission.\nA number was assigned to each phase: 1 for blast crisis, 2\nfor accelerated phase, 3 for chronic phase and 4 for remis-\nsion, making this a discrete variable. In this categorization\nthe lowest number represents the worst possible clinical\nstate (blast crisis) and the highest number denotes the\nbest possible clinical state (remission).\nExplanatory Variables\nA number of explanatory variables were included in the\nanalysis, as follows: Origphase refers to the patient's health\nor clinical state upon their admission to the program; it\ncan therefore be categorized as 1 for blast crisis, 2 for\naccelerated phase and 3 for chronic phase. The study\nperiod commenced in quarter 1, 2005, and all patients\nactive before that date are excluded from the analysis.\nAge at approval is the age of the patient at the time of their\nadmission to the program. Quarter (1-12) refers to time,\nstarting with the first quarter of 2005 till the fourth quar-\nter of 2007, a total of 12 quarters. This is a control variable\nused to capture unobserved heterogeneity, factors which\nchange over time and cannot be included in the vector of\nexplanatory variables and enables to control for natural\nchanges in patient outcomes over time. There are many\nfactors that tend to change over time and the inclusion of\na time variable eliminates this effect. Gender is a dummy\nvariable, which takes the value of 0 for men and 1 for\nwomen. Gap denotes the number of months from the\nconfirmation of the diagnosis date to the approval of par-\nticipation in GIPAP.\nClose indicates whether a patient has been closed at least\nonce over the period he has been participating in the pro-\ngram. It is a binary variable taking the value of 0 and 1, 0\nindicating that the patient has never been closed, 1 indi-\ncating that patient has been closed at least once. A patient\nis considered to be closed when s\/he has not reported for\ntreatment to his\/her designated centre for 1 quarter. Con-\nsequently, this does not refer to the present status of the\npatient as active or closed. It is used as a control variable\nto capture unobserved characteristics of a patient who has\nnot always been present in the program. Patients may be\nclassified as \"closed\" for a variety of reasons, including (a)\ninability to keep track of the patient, (b) the patient not\nmaking the journey to the clinic where treatment takes\nplace, (c) the patient not showing up on the specified day\nof their treatment, (d) inability to contact the patient, (e)\nbecoming ineligible to receive treatment through GIPAP\nand (f) death. It is also possible that individual patients\nmay be \"closed\" more than once and re-appear in the\ndatabase, as patient participation depends on receipt of\ntreatment and monitoring on a quarterly basis. With the\nexception of death, none of these reasons prevent patients\nfrom re-entering the program in the next period once they\nshow up for their treatment. Thus, closures are a source of\npotential bias in the data but they by no means imply that\nthe patient is deceased. Whereas patients who were closed\nbut re-entered the program did not die, for those who do\nnot re-appear in the dataset till the end of the study period\nwe cannot be certain about their status. This is a limitation\nof the available data. Overall, there does not appear to be\nany seasonal effect in the number of closed cases.\nIns is a dummy variable, taking into account whether a\ncountry offers universal health insurance coverage to part\nof its population. Four countries (The Russian Federation,\nArgentina, Chile and Georgia) offer universal health\ninsurance coverage - although by no means comprehen-\nsive - to their population, whereas all other study coun-\ntries do not. Although this does not apply to the GIPAP-\neligible population, as the latter is selected based on ina-\nbility to pay, this variable is used as a control to explain\nany heterogeneity in the data. For instance, it could be\nargued that the presence of universal health insurance\nindicates better features of the health system as a whole.\nHealth planning and improved geographical access could\nbe part of a program which includes health insurance for\na significant part of the population.\nIn addition, 14 country dummies are included, one for\neach country, in order to control for any country-specificPage 4 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:19 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/19effects as well as evaluate how the program compares\nacross countries. Finally, 13 dummy variables have been\nintroduced to identify patient occupation: Undefined, agri-\nculture, business, education, government, health and social\nwork, manufacturing, other, retired, self employed, student,\ntransport and unemployed. Profession also captures other,\nunobserved patient characteristics, such as education,\nmedical sophistication and lifestyle. Table 2 presents all\nvariables included in the analysis and their definition.\nModel Specification\nBased on the discussion in the previous section, the model\nthat is considered for empirical analysis has the following\nspecification:\nCurphase quarter origphase ins ageatit i it it it= + + + + +b b b b b b0 1 2 3 4 approval gender\ngap close CountryDummy\nit it\nit it it\n+\n+ + + +\nb\nb b b\n5\n6 7 8 b e9OccupationDummyit it+\n(1)\nTable 2: Variables and definitions\nVariable Mean Std.

These also\nshow how characteristics change after entering the pro-\ngram.\nPanel data are used to conduct the econometric analysis.\nThe use of panel data is justified because it controls for\nunobserved heterogeneity across individuals. The nature\nof the patient-specific data allows the reasonable assump-\ntion to be made that unobserved heterogeneity is uncorre-\nlated with the included variables.\nIn this analysis, the special (ordinal) nature of the\ndependent variable dictates the use of the ordered model.\nA Panel Data Ordered Probit (OP) model is therefore used\nin this case, as the dependent variable is not continuous.\nDiscrete values are assigned to different groups of obser-\nvations, which change as patients' reported health state\nchanges. The OP model is preferable to the Ordinary Least\nSquares (OLS) model because in the latter the variance of\nthe error term is not constant and is dependent upon the\nexplanatory variables [14]. The dependent variable is thus\nordered in such a way that imposes the use of the OP\nmodel: An OP model treats differences between discrete\noutcomes as constant [15]. In this model, the dependent\nvariable has a logical ordering. Current phase is ordered in\na logical sequence, depending on the severity of the dis-\nease, assigning different values to the different phases: 1\nfor blast crisis, 2 for accelerated phase, 3 for chronic phase\nand 4 for remission, as identified in the literature. The\norder assigns an increasing number for a better condition.\nThe odds ratio (OR) shows the probability of the patient\nmoving to a higher phase, over the probability of the\npatient moving to a lower phase. In other words, the odds\nratio shows, for a unit change in the regressor, the odds of\na higher phase compared to a lower phase are changed by\na factor of the independent variable, other things being\nequal.\nSurvival analysis\nThe study period and the longitudinal nature of the data\nenables the assessment of the number of patients that\nremained active up to 3 years after they first entered the\nprogram (2005 - 2007). The definition of \"active patients\"\nmeans that these patients continue to be registered in the\nprogram and benefit from the treatment provided. Conse-\nquently, this enables the measurement of survival at indi-\nvidual patient level. In order to examine this, 4 waves of\nnew patients were isolated and studied, each wave enter-\ning quarterly in 2005. By following these patients through\nto the end of the study period, it was possible to calculate\nhow many would benefit from GIPAP and observe the\nattrition rate over three years. A survival rate was calcu-\nlated as the ratio of those continuing to receive medica-\ntion over the total number of patients that entered\noriginally.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nA summary of the descriptive statistics from the 15 study\ncountries is shown in Table 3. Of all participating patients,\n62.3% are male. This is consistent with findings in other\nsettings that CML is a disease affecting men more fre-\nquently than women. According to the National Cancer\nInstitute, CML affects 1.9 per 100,000 men and 1.1 per\n100,000 women in the United States. The average age at\ndiagnosis in this study is 38.7 years, which is significantly\nlower than similar patient cohorts in developed countries.\nIn the United States the average age at diagnosis over the\n2001-2005 period was 66 years [16]. The dominant age\ngroup in the study is age band 31-40 years (26.9%), fol-\nlowed by 41-50 years (21.5%) and 21-30 years (20.5%).\nAt the time of initial diagnosis, 11,414 patients (84.14%)\nwere in the chronic phase, 1,229 (9.05%) were at the\naccelerated phase and 923 (6.8%) were in blast crisis. No\npatients enter GIPAP in the \"remission\" phase; patients in\nremission reach that stage after receiving treatment.\nResults of the Econometric Analysis\nIn order to account for the factors that determine the\nprogress of a patient diagnosed with CML, an Ordered\nProbit panel data econometric model was estimated. The\npanel identifier is the individual patient, as there exist\nmultiple observations for each patient at different points\nin time. Following the model in equation (1), the depend-\nent variable was the current health state of the patient\nsuch that the higher the number assigned to the current\nstate, the better the patient's overall condition or outlook.\nThe explanatory variables included different socio-eco-\nnomic factors and demographics.\nThe original phase is positively and significantly associ-\nated with the current phase (OR = 30.5, \u03b1 = 1%), indicat-\ning that patients classified as chronic in the original phase\nwere significantly much more likely to improve over time\n(more likely to move towards a better health state); com-\nparable effects could be seen for those patients in the\naccelerated phase or blast crisis in the original phase. This\nis consistent with expectations and the results shown in\nthe previous section, as patients whose initial conditionPage 6 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:19 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/19was better are expected, on average, to be doing better at\nlater stages, once they enroll on the program. This also\nsuggests that, overall, the program contributes to patient\nhealth improvement.\nPatient age at approval is not statistically significant and\nthe OR is very close to 1. Results for gender show that this\nvariable is not statistically significant either. The time gap\nbetween diagnosis and approval for entry into the pro-\ngram is statistically significant. The larger the gap between\ndiagnosis and approval for GIPAP participation, the more\nlikely it is that the patient's condition deteriorates (OR =\n0.995, \u03b1 = 1%). This is explained by the fact that during\nthis time gap most patients would not have access to treat-\nment. As a result, shortening this gap over time may have\ncontributed to fast access to medical treatment by eligible\npatients.\nTable 3: Summary Statistics at Patient Level, 2005 - 2007\nParticipants (Total) 13,568\nAverage Age (years) 38.69\nAverage Time Gap between Diagnosis and Approval (months) 4.61\nAge Group No. of patients No. of observations\n0-20 1,332 9.82% 6474 9.71%\n21-30 2,786 20.53% 13,970 20.95%\n31-40 3,646 26.87% 18,273 27.40%\n41-50 2,914 21.48% 14,191 21.28%\n51-60 1,895 13.97% 9,185 13.77%\n61-70 758 5.59% 3594 5.39%\n71+ 237 1.75% 994 1.49%\nTotal 13,568 100.00% 66,681 100.00%\nGender\nNo. of patients No. of observations\nMale 8,453 62.30% 41,873 62.80%\nFemale 5,115 37.70% 24,808 37.20%\nTotal 13,568 100.00% 66,681 100.00%\nOriginal Phase\nNo. of patients No. of observations\nChronic 11,414 84.14% 57,728 86.57%\nAccelerated 1,228 9.05% 5,958 8.94%\nBlast Crisis 923 6.80% 2,995 4.49%\nTotal 13565 100.00% 66,681 100.00%\nCurrent Phase\nNo. of patients1 No. of observations\nChronic N\/A 54,192 81.27%\nAccelerated 4,587 6.88%\nBlast Crisis 2,794 4.19%\nRemission 5,108 7.66%\nTotal 66,681 100.00%\nStatus\nNo. of patients1 No. of observations\nClosed N\/A 3,734 5.60%\nActive 62,947 94.40%\nTotal 66,681 100.00%\nNote: 1 Although we do have data at patient level, we cannot report summary statistics here, as this changes per patient over time.

Such features may be better\nhealth planning and improved geographic access.\nThe country dummies help control for the country effect\nand any other regional differences that are not captured by\nother variables. Only Argentina, Georgia, Kenya, Malaysia\nand Sudan differ from the reference country (Thailand).\nThis shows how patients are more likely to do in terms of\nprogress with their disease in different countries. The\neffect of occupation is a set of 13 dummy variables show-\ning that skilled workers (business, education, govern-\nment) and the self-employed are significantly more likely\nto move to a better health state than less skilled workers\nor retirees.\nThe model results presented in Table 4 relate to all 15\ncountries; three of these countries account for 78.3% of\nthe total number of observations (India, 52% of the total\nsample; China, 16%; and Pakistan, 10.3%). As a small\nnumber of countries dominate the sample, there may be\npotential for bias in the results. In order to account for\nthis, separate estimations have been produced for India,\nChina, Pakistan, as well as for the remaining 12 countries\ntogether in order to determine if there are significant dif-\nferences in the results. These are presented in Table 5. The\noriginal phase is statistically significant in all four cases,\nand towards the same direction, showing that enrolment\non the program can improve patient outlook (OR>1, \u03b1 =\n1%). Age, gender, the time gap between diagnosis and\napproval and whether a patient is closed or not also have\nthe same effect across all 4 separate regressions. Overall,\nthe results across the four different models appear to be in\nthe same direction, and consistent with those in the aggre-\ngate sample, suggesting that the factors influencing\npatient progress are similar across the countries in the\nsample, and that the inclusion of a large number of obser-\nvations from just 3 countries does not create a bias.\nSurvival over time\nIn total, 3,529 active patients entered GIPAP in the four\nquarters of 2005. Figure 1 shows their progress and grad-\nual attrition quarterly over the 2005 - 2007 study period.\nTable 6 summarises the number of active patients per\nwave and shows the patient attrition on a quarterly basis\nas well as the number of active patients remaining at the\nend of each quarter. Examining the first wave of patients\nduring the first quarter of 2005 (Q1 - 2005), a total of 850\nactive patients entered GIPAP. For these patients, there is\na total of 7,596 observations over the 3-year period (12\nquarters), corresponding to an average of 8.94 observa-\ntions per patient. Given this natural ceiling, more than 2\nyears average active period per patient is very high (as\nmany will carry on being active beyond the study period).\nThis indicates that for many patients CML becomes a\nchronic condition and that those benefiting from imat-\ninib are able to return to their activities and in principle\ncontinue to contribute to their families and the local econ-\nomy.

Thus, out of 850 active\npatients who started in Q1 2005, 520 were still reported\nin the database and were active after 3 years, correspond-\ning to 61.2% of the original patient total. Of the total\nnumber of patients who entered in each quarter of 2005,\nat the end of the study period (after 12, 11, 10 and 9 quar-\nters for waves 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively), in total 2,317\npatients remained active in the fourth quarter of 2007,\ncorresponding to a 66% survival rate.\nFigure 2 demonstrates the Kaplan - Meier survival esti-\nmates. The Kaplan-Meier survival probability is the frac-\ntion of the number of patients surviving in each quarter\nover the number of patients at risk. The probability of sur-\nviving to any point is estimated from the cumulative prob-\nability of surviving each of the preceding time intervals.\nThus the graph shows the fraction of the population\nwhich survives over time. The four waves are graphed sep-\narately on the same axes, showing how patients in each\nwave perform. When comparing survival across the four\nwaves, the 9-quarter survival ranges between 65.8% (wave\n1, covering the period from 2005, Q1, to 2007, Q1) and\n72.4% (wave 4, covering the period from 2005, Q4, to\n2007, Q4). By the end of the study period (2007, Q4),\n66% of all CML patients remain active and are shown to\nbe receiving treatment under GIPAP. This compares\nfavourably with the IRIS clinical trial data, despite the dif-\nficulties in delivering care in developing countries. Fur-\nther, many cases are lost track of, indicating that patients\nmay survive, which would lead to even higher survival\nrates (Appendix 1, Note 6).\nDiscussion & Policy Implications\nAccess to medicines in developing countries continues to\nbe adversely affected by poverty and the lack of adequate\nstatutory health insurance coverage to local populations.\nAdditional predicaments include the poor state of health\nfacilities as well as geographical disparities in their availa-\nbility, which further hamper patient access. Patients diag-\nnosed with CML are no exception to the above problems.\nAlthough treatments such as imatinib are in principle\navailable on the private market, the out-of-pocket acquisi-\ntion cost is prohibitive for most developing country\npatients, as the annual drug treatment cost may exceed\n$36,000 [17]. Even in cases where a generic version of\nbranded imatinib becomes available, the out-of-pocket\ncost continues to be unaffordable for the vast majority of\npatients. Treatment alternatives to imatinib require spe-\ncialized care, which may be expensive, not available\nwithin easy reach, and with uncertain outcome.\nThe findings of the study suggest that patients are signifi-\ncantly much more likely to move towards a better health\nstate after receiving treatment irrespective of their disease\nstage at the point of entry to the program and that the\nlarger the gap between diagnosis and approval for partici-\nTable 5: GIPAP: Results of a Random Effects Ordered Probit Model - country breakdown\nCountry Regressions\nModel India China Pakistan Remaining 12 countries\nDependent Variable Curphase Curphase Curphase Curphase\nOdds Ratio SE Odds Ratio SE Odds Ratio SE Odds Ratio SE\nQuarter 1.069*** 0.006 1.089*** 0.009 0.983 0.015 1.093*** 0.006\nOrigphase 240.567*** 0.104 21.052*** 0.063 115.816*** 0.165 18.102*** 0.073\nAgeatapproval 1.005*** 0.002 0.998 0.002 1.016*** 0.004 0.994*** 0.003\nGender 1.012 0.057 1.021 0.066 1.141 0.106 0.933 0.063\nGap 0.996 0.004 1.001 0.003 0.985** 0.007 0.990*** 0.003\nClose 0.685*** 0.086 0.691*** 0.088 0.404*** 0.196 0.694*** 0.059\nLog Likelihood -6663.125 -4495.819 -1277.437 -6638.452\nLR chi2(31) 4401.33 2278.68 660.41 1612.61\nObservations 34,686 10,663 6,837 14,493\nNote: Significance levels: *** indicates significance at 1% level; ** at 5% level and * at 10% level.\nActive Patients, Waves 1, 2, 3, 4Figure 1\nActive Patients, Waves 1, 2, 3, 4.

Under\nthe auspices of GIPAP, CML patients are granted free med-\nical treatment, reducing total health costs significantly,\npotentially helping patients return to normal activity and\ncontributing to life extension. This becomes even more\nimportant when taking into account that the average age\nof CML patients in developing countries is significantly\nlower than that in developed countries [18], suggesting\nthat GIPAP helps patients in very productive ages. Dem-\nonstrating benefit has obvious positive societal implica-\ntions for patients and their families in terms of ability to\nwork and contribution to family income. The 3-year sur-\nvival was found to be at minimum 66% of the originally\nenrolled patients across the 15 study countries and this\ncompares favorably with other studies in the developed\nworld [18]. This is also a strong indication that the pro-\ngram provides a sustainable health benefit and that\npatients return for their treatment at regular intervals.\nThe success of GIPAP depends on whether and how\npatients' lives are extended by participation in the pro-\ngram. If at least two thirds of patients who originally reg-\nistered in the program and suffering from this life-\nthreatening condition are still participating after a 3 year\nperiod, this is a strong indication that the program deliv-\ners care and helps patients stay alive. This rate is likely to\nbe an underestimate of true overall survival because of the\nlikely biases in the attrition rate and the number of\npatients classified as closed. Because of the definition of\n\"closure\", the attrition rate includes patients who may not\nhave died and may still be receiving the treatment through\nother sources. As a result, the survival rate obtained is the\nminimum survival rate of patients in the study period.\nGIPAP seems to fulfill the critical role of enabling access\nto very poor patients and providing a life-saving treatment\nthat extends life. Many GIPAP participants go into remis-\nsion after receiving imatinib through the program, while\nTable 6: GIPAP: 3-year survival for patients entering the programme in 2005\n2005 2006 2007\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\nWave 1 (entering quarter 1, 2005)\nActive 850 742 701 680 649 626 603 576 559 557 533 520\nNot reported\/Closed 108 149 170 201 224 247 274 291 293 317 330\nTotal 850 850 850 850 850 850 850 850 850 850 850 850\nWave 2 (entering quarter 2, 2005)\nActive 0 866 752 717 695 655 630 594 574 588 557 537\nNot reported\/Closed 114 149 171 211 236 272 292 278 309 329\nTotal 0 866 866 866 866 866 866 866 866 866 866 866\nWave 3 (entering quarter 3, 2005)\nActive 0 0 910 795 752 723 704 664 649 639 608 606\nNot reported\/Closed 115 158 187 206 246 261 271 302 304\nTotal 0 0 910 910 910 910 910 910 910 910 910 910\nWave 4 (entering quarter 4, 2005)\nActive 0 0 0 903 821 775 745 710 695 680 656 654\nNot reported\/Closed 82 128 158 193 208 223 247 249\nTotal 0 0 0 903 903 903 903 903 903 903 903 903\nAll 4 waves (quarters 1 - 4, 2005)\nTotal Active 850 1608 2363 3095 2917 2779 2682 2544 2477 2464 2354 2317\nTotal Not reported\/Closed 0 108 263 434 612 750 847 985 1052 1065 1175 1212\nTotal number of patients 850 1716 2626 3529 3529 3529 3529 3529 3529 3529 3529 3529\nSource: The authors from GIPAP.Page 10 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:19 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/19they would otherwise be unable to access the treatment\nthemselves and face deteriorating health. Participation in\nthe program is voluntary, and some patients may choose\nto drop out; although this is not a desirable outcome, a\npatient cannot be prohibited from discontinuing the\ntreatment, despite the impact this may have on further\npatient follow-up, adherence, overall cost and long-term\nsurvival [19].\nClose monitoring of patients is critical in order to achieve\nthe maximum possible adherence and maximize impact.\nGiven that many patients live in isolated, remote areas,\nwith limited access to their participating physician or hos-\npital due to distance or unaffordable travel costs, the effec-\ntiveness of the program may be adversely affected\ncompared with a situation where patients have easy access\nto health facilities and professionals. This is compatible\nwith other comparable findings [20] and in order to alle-\nviate what seems to be a health problem compounded by\npoverty, local governments can assist by improving infra-\nstructure and communications, in order to maximize the\nbenefit of programs such as GIPAP.\nGIPAP coincides with the appearance and subsequent\nproliferation of Global Health Partnerships (GHPs) in the\nlast decade or so, which have amassed significant support\namong bilateral and multilateral donor agencies [9] and\nhave included product supply initiatives such as the ITI\nand the AAI. There are arguments favoring GHPs over\nbilateral or multilateral aid, which also apply in the case\nof GIPAP and include (a) flexibility in terms of organizing\nand delivering care where needed; (b) scale economies;\n(c) country links, enabling delivery of care and assistance\nin a timely fashion; (d) independence from country-spe-\ncific structures as well as donor country preferences; and\n(e) their effectiveness in terms of raising and using aid\n[21]. As a drug donation scheme, GIPAP must fulfill and\nadhere to certain criteria set up by the World Health\nOrganization on drug donations [22] and good pharma-\nceutical procurement [23].\nDrug donation and distribution programs such as GIPAP\nmay provide an alternative platform for drug access to eli-\ngible patients in developing countries. By building on\nexisting structures in health facilities and mobilizing clini-\ncians at no additional cost to local health systems, GIPAP\nenables access to a life-saving medication at no cost to\npatients or the local health care systems and transforming\na life-threatening disease into a chronic condition. The\ndistribution of the medicine from the manufacturer to the\npatient via the associated NGO provides a practical solu-\ntion which also avoids other potential problems associ-\nated with drug donations and distribution channel\nshortcomings in both developing and transitional country\ncontexts. Indeed, evidence suggests that although human-\nitarian donations have been an important source of med-\nicines for many countries, the donated drugs may not\nreach their intended targets, namely the patients [24-26].\nOverall, assuming there is continuity in the program over\nthe long-term, that it is not an opportunistic venture and\nthat the drug donation segment is compliant with the\nWHO guidelines for drug donations, programs such as\nGIPAP, resulting from a partnership between different\nstakeholders, could provide alternative models of ena-\nbling access, providing effective and targeted health care\nand making healthcare affordable to patients in develop-\ning countries in the absence of a formal health insurance\ncoverage system.\nThe preceding analysis is not without limitations. The\ndependent variable is subjective and based on physician\nassessment, the latter being subject to time pressure; this\nmay lead to limitations when examining the factors influ-\nencing patient current phase. Additionally, the data do\nnot record with precision the reason for all \"closed\" cases.\nAlthough it may not be possible in all developing country\nsettings to follow all patients, not knowing the precise rea-\nson for patient drop-outs can only provide an estimate of\nsurvival analysis. Finally, it may be the case that the results\nof the study may not be generalizable to the other coun-\ntries that GIPAP covers.\nConclusions\nGIPAP has been offering free treatment to CML patients in\ndeveloping countries since 2002. This is an example of\npatient assistance in countries where very little or no\nhealth insurance or prescription drug coverage exists and\npatients cannot afford appropriate treatment. Such initia-\ntives can work as a complement to existing public health\ninsurance schemes and help people fight life-threatening\nconditions such as CML.\nSurvival Analysis (2005 - 2007, quarterly)Figure 2\nSurvival Analysis (2005 - 2007, quarterly).

The empirical model has\nhelped observe the effects of various characteristics on the\nphase patients are in and helped detect the differences\nacross participating countries. The survival analysis\nshowed that the majority of GIPAP participants remain in\nthe program for a long time, clearly underlining its effect\non transforming a life-threatening disease into a chronic\none. Access issues are not evident because GIPAP is in\nitself a program facilitating access.\nFuture research could include data from CML patients in\ndeveloped countries, and compare the outcomes of treat-\nment of insured patients in developed countries to GIPAP\nparticipants. This would show how the program works\ncompared to countries with regular health insurance and\nwould test the possibility of such a patient assistance pro-\ngram to act as a substitute for health insurance.\nCompeting interests\nThis research was funded via an unrestricted educational\ngrant from Novartis.\nAuthors' contributions\nStudy conception and design: PK.

The criteria for selecting these centers include\nhaving diagnostic capabilities and having had previous\nexperience treating CML. In many countries the GIPAP\nQualified Institution is the only institution able to diag-\nnose or with the experience to treat CML. This is the case\nparticularly in many African countries where there is one\ncancer center in a single country.
