This paper \nattempts to help redress this balance. The paper initially presents a summary of the \nbehaviour of offline flirting and particularly identifies what constitutes offline flirting \nsignals. Given this background context, suggestions are made as to how we might \nbetter conceptualize online flirting. The prevailing wisdom has been that we should \nfocus on the absence of the body in cyberspace. This view is challenged here. Instead, \nit is argued that researchers should re-orient their focus to how the body is \nreconstructed online. Winnicott\u2019s notions of \u2018potential space\u2019 and \u2018transitional \nobjects\u2019 are drawn upon in this paper to advance an argument that online flirting \nshould be considered as a form of play. In making this argument, it is contended that \nonline flirting has unique aspects in comparison to offline flirting. In particular, while \nrealistic elements are present in online flirting, there is a blurring between what is \nreality and fantasy when one engages in flirtatious behaviour on the Internet. \n \nKey Words: cyberspace, flirting, Internet, online relationships, play, psychoanalytic, \nWinnicott \n  \nCase was twenty-four. At twenty-two, he\u2019d been a cowboy, a rustler, one of the \nbest in the sprawl. . . . He\u2019d operated on an almost permanent adrenaline \nhigh, a byproduct of youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom cyberspace \ndeck that projected his disembodied consciousness in the consensual \nhallucination that was the matrix. (Gibson, 1986, pp. 11\u201312) \n \nFor Gibson, who invented the term, \u2018cyberspace\u2019 offers an ultimately liberating \nexperience. In his book Neuromancer (1986), the main character, Case, becomes \naddicted to cyberspace. Virtual reality is a space where one\u2019s dreams can be satisfied. \nIn this space, one can excogitate new identities. The fictional characters of \nNeuromancer experience cyberspace as a place of rapture and erotic intensity. Within \nGibson\u2019s matrix, entities attain a \u2018hyperreality\u2019. In comparison, ordinary experience \nappears dull and mundane. Gibson (1986) also highlights the erotic appeal of \ncyberspace: \n \nNow she straddled him again, took his hand, and closed it over her, his thumb \nalong the cleft of her buttocks, his fingers spread across the labia. As she \nbegan to lower herself, the images came pulsing back, the faces, fragments of \nneon arriving and receding. She slid down around him and his back arched \nconvulsively. (p. 45) \n \nWhen Gibson wrote Neuromancer he had little knowledge of computers or how \ninteractions might actually occur in cyberspace. Nevertheless, his fictional writing has \nhad some influence on our non-fictional perceptions about interactions over the \nInternet. Gibson\u2019s fictional world of cyberspace is a place to play. This paper, in turn, \nputs forth the argument that the Internet affords the possibility for another type of \nplay: flirting, or, to phrase this another way, playing at love. \n \nAims of this Paper \n \nThere is a paucity of research and theorizing on the topic of online flirting. This paper \nexplores how we might better conceptualize flirting in cyberspace and how this is \ndifferent to offline flirting. First, a definition of flirting is offered, together with an \nadumbration of the history of flirting and the courting process. Following this \ndiscussion, the meagre amount of research on offline flirting signals is outlined. The \npaper then turns to consider how flirting in cyberspace might be better understood. \nAlthough past theorists have typically focused on the absence of the body on the \nInternet, it is argued here that it is more productive for researchers to shift their focus \nto the reconstruction of the body online. In considering this, a new way of thinking \nabout flirting online is outlined. For instance, the body can be reconstituted through \nthe text; in turn, this can provide a space where flirtation is easier and more playful \nthan offline flirting. Winnicott\u2019s conceptions of play and \u2018potential space\u2019 are utilized \nhere to develop the notion that the Internet provides a space for online flirting as a \nunique form of play. In addition, the term \u2018magic realism\u2019 is drawn upon to aid us in \nunderstanding how, when we are online, there is a blurring of the boundaries between \nfantasy and reality. It is contended that the \u2018fuzziness\u2019 between what is real and what \nis fantasy affords the cyber participant the opportunity to play with love online. \n \nWhat Does It Mean to Flirt? \nTheorists have offered various definitions of flirting. For example, Downey and \nVitulli (1987) have argued that flirtation can be defined in two ways:  \n \nOne implies an existing casual relationship where one or both persons are \nengaged in maintaining some suggestion or expectation of intimacy with out \nintentions of increasing its level or allowing some type of \u2018consummation\u2019. . . \nbut another common meaning seems to refer simply to the initial actions one \ntakes to convey a message of interest or attraction. (p. 899) \nIn contrast to this definition, Feinberg (1996) contends that flirting involves teasing \nand communication. She proposes that flirting is a short cut to intimacy. She argues \nthat: \u2018Flirting transmits a hidden message the same as other types of teasing. The \nunderlying communication is to find out how intimate a person wants to become or if \nshe wants to become intimate at all\u2019 \n(p. 40). \n \nAlthough evolutionary psychologists purport that flirting is a universal basic instinct \nnecessary for the procreation of the species, there appear to be other motivations for \nflirting. The aim of flirting for some might be purely to indicate sexual attraction to \nanother, but this has been found not to be the sole purpose of flirtation. Rather, there \nare three main reasons for why people flirt: to signal sexual interest, to test the ground \nto see if others still find them attractive, or simply to pass the time of day (Feinberg, \n1996). \n \nOffline Flirting: A Short History \nBefore moving on to compare and contrast online flirting with offline flirting, it is \ninstructive to consider the history of the courting process. It has been noticed that \ncourtship rituals have changed over time (Mongeau, Hale, Johnson, & Hillis, 1993; \nRice, 1996). Prior to the 20th century, in Western cultures, courtship involved the \nman calling upon the woman. This would generally be at her invitation. Koller (1951) \nhas explained that the man visited his potential beloved at her home, so that the \nwomen could display her domestic talents under the watchful eye of her parents. \nSince this time, the rules of the courting ritual have changed from remaining in the \nhome, to going on dates outside the home. Mongeau et al. (1993) believe that this \ntransition alters who makes the first move. They contend that, from around the turn of \nthe 20th century, men began to initiate the courtship, generally because they had to \npay for the date and arrange transportation. Although Mongeau and his colleagues are \nnot wrong in stating that at this time men started to do the asking out, I would suggest \nthat they have missed an important stage in the courting ritual: that of flirtation. If we \npay close attention to the non-verbal signals displayed before the male actually asks \nthe woman out, then it would seem more plausible to argue that it is the woman who \ncontrols the interaction in the early phases of courtship.  \nGivens\u2019 (1978) five-stage model on courting explains how it is that women \nmake the first move. According to Givens, the first stage is the attention phase, where \nwomen typically use primping, object caressing (see below) and using quick glances \nat and then away from the male. In the second phase, the recognition phase, flirting \nbehaviour consists of head cocking, pouting, primping, eyebrow flashes (see also \nbelow) and smiling. Givens suggests that interaction does not occur until the third \nstage, where conversation is initiated. During this stage, participants appear highly \nanimated, displaying laughing or giggling. Interestingly, Givens notes that men are \ngenerally hesitant to approach women without some initial indication of interest from \nthe woman. \nGivens\u2019 work not only demonstrates that women make the first move, but also \nhighlights the importance of non-verbal cues in the signalling of sexual attraction. \nThese signals are crucial in the game of flirting. \n \nOffline Signals: The Crucial Place of Non-verbal Cues \nAs highlighted in Givens\u2019 work, flirting behaviour consists mainly of nonverbal \nsignals. Researchers such as, Feinberg, (1996), Koeppel, Montagne- Miller, O\u2019Hair, \nand Cody (1993) and Moore (1985) have identified a repertoire of facial expressions \nand gestures. The importance of the body in flirting is not so surprising given that \nconveying feelings verbally about sexual interest involves a high risk of \nembarrassment or possible rejection. Unlike the spoken word, body language can \nsignal attraction without being too obvious. This ambiguity protects people from \nhumiliation if the person they are signalling attraction to does share these sentiments. \nSome basic codes that are important to consider in flirting include kinetics, \noculesics, physical appearance, olfactics, vocalics, proxemics and haptics. Much of \nthe research (see, e.g., Moore, 1985) reveals that flirting usually consists of a \ncombination of these basic codes. It is instructive to consider these codes a little \nfurther. \nThe basic code of kinetic gestures would include, in particular among women, \nphenomena such as tossing one\u2019s hair so that one\u2019s face is tilted upwards and one\u2019s \nneck is exposed. Women also often lick their lips, or pout to indicate attraction. To \nmirror another\u2019s body movements is often a sign of attraction. Smiling, laughing and \ngiggling can also signal attraction. \nOculesics, or eye movements, can reveal a great deal about a person\u2019s \nfeelings. A person\u2019s pupils will dilate if they are attracted to another. Flirtatious \nbehaviour often consists of demure glances downward, a short darting glance \n(glancing at a person one is attracted to for a few seconds, glancing away, then \nlooking back again), and eyebrow flashes (the raising of both eyebrows for a couple \nof seconds, usually accompanied by a smile and eye contact). \nGiven that researchers have mostly agreed that first impressions leave a lasting \nimpression (e.g., Asch, 1946; Dion, Berscheid, & Walster, 1972), it is no surprise that \npeople take more care of their physical appearance when they hope to attract another. \nIn Dion et al.\u2019s (1972) classic study it was revealed that participants given \nphotographs of more attractive people were more likely to think they would be \nhappier people, make happier mates, and have higher status occupations than less \nattractive people. Research has also found that men more than women rated physical \nattractiveness to be an important quality in a partner (e.g. Travris, 1977). Hence, we \nwould expect that women more than men would take care to look attractive. \nIn addition to looking good, individuals make attempts to smell good. \nHowever, store-bought perfume is more a decoration than a love potion. Despite what \nthe perfume and deodorant companies would have us believe, men prefer women with \na light amount of perfume. Interestingly, women are attracted to men whose MHC \n(major histocompatibility complex\u2014a segment of the DNA that we can smell, which \ndetermines what diseases we are inherently resistant to) is more varied to their own \n(Wedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, & Paepke, 1995). \nThe use of voice is a most telling indicator of the type of interaction that is \ntaking place. Flirtatious speech is more animated, with moderate amounts of laughter, \ndecreased silences and pauses, and increased warmth and interest. \nProxemics is the amount of personal distance kept between individuals. \nIndividuals who lean toward one another and who are at the same body angle are \nperceived as being more seductive than those individuals who lean away from each \nother. Flirtatious behaviour is further characterized by crossing legs toward one \nanother and more face-to-face interaction. Haptics, or the use of touch, is a common \nform of communication, particularly in flirtatious behaviour. Another sign of \nseductive behaviour is unnecessary clothing adjustment, for example playing with \nbuttons, jewellery, a tie, or smoothing out one\u2019s skirt or trousers. Yet another \nindicator of attraction is called \u2018object caress\u2019, where individuals fondle with their \nkeys or perhaps their wine glasses. \n \nDefining Cyberspace: The Disembodied Form \nBefore moving on to examine how people might flirt online, we need to consider what \ncyberspace actually is. It is generally understood that cyberspace is the space \ngenerated by software within a computer that produces a virtual reality. More \nimportant to the discussion in this paper, cyberspace has been typically defined as a \nspace where disembodied communication can take place. For example, Argyle and \nShields (1996) contended that \u2018technology is often viewed as source of separation \nbetween people, a barrier\u2019 (p. 58). In addition, Clark (1997) has proposed that in \u2018the \nvirtual environment, we can exist in either a disembodied or a cyberspatial form\u2019 (p. \n86). In both of these examples the emphasis is placed on the absence of the body in \ncyberspace. \n When theorists discuss relationships developed in cyberspace they also often \nfocus their writings on the absence of the body. Cybersex, for instance, has been a \npopular topic of discussion. In their discussions of cybersex, theorists often emphasize \nthe idea that participants can engage in virtual sex without the real presence of \nbodies. In respect to Internet romantic relationships, one writer has commented that \n\u2018some Internet lovers come to the conclusion that they love each other before they \neven meet or without ever meeting\u2019 (Gwinnell, 1998, p. 89). The implication here is \nthat bodies can only meet offline. To give a further example, McRae (1996) has \ndefined cybersex or virtual sex as \u2018a generic term for erotic interaction between \nindividuals whose bodies may never touch\u2019 (p. 243). Again this writer is focusing on \nthe lack of bodies online. \nAn alternative view of cyberspace is that it existed before the origins of the \nInternet, in the form of telephone calls. As such, theorists such as Stratton (1997) \nargue, cyberspace should essentially be understood \u2018simply as the space produced by \nhuman communication when it is mediated by technology in such a way that the body \nis absent\u2019 (p. 29).  \nThe possibility of email affairs has also been outlined by Stratton (1997). \nAgain he emphasizes the lack of body in these encounters: \u2018Because the couple have \nnot met, there is even greater latitude for the development of bodyless selves, and for \nthe fantastic creation of virtual bodies for those selves\u2019 (p. 30). \nThis view of cyberspace as being a place where there is no body is a very \nnarrow construction of how we should conceive of this space and the activity that \noccurs within it. In contrast to this very restricted view, which is somewhat of a \nmetaphysical interpretation, it is argued in this paper that the phenomenon of flirting \nbehaviour in cyberspace is such that it is in fact the reconstruction of the body that is \nimperative to the success of many interpersonal interactions over the Internet. \nFor example, Stone (1995) has discussed the importance of the body in \ntelephone sex. She has pointed out that telephone sex is clearly a different kind of sex \nto physical or \u2018embodied\u2019 sex. Physical sex involves a range of senses, touch, sight, \nsound, smell and hearing. In contrast, telephone sex workers are required to translate \nthe physical experience of sex into an audible form. In turn, the receiver at the other \nend of the line needs to reconstitute these images. As Stone (1995) describes, \u2018what\u2019s \nbeing sent back and forth over the wires isn\u2019t merely information, it\u2019s bodies, not \nphysical objects, but the information necessary to reconstruct the meaning of body to \nalmost any desired depth and complexity\u2019 (p. 244). \nIn respect to cyberspace, while it cannot be denied that the physical body is \nnot present in the textual exchanges in cyberspace, how the real physical body is \nreconstructed should be of interest to researchers. For although we do not have \nphysical, tangible bodies in cyberspace, we do nevertheless have bodies. If one were \nto peruse the textual exchanges on bulletin boards, discussion boards or chat rooms, one \nwould find ample evidence of constructed bodies. For instance, people describe what \ntheir bodies look like and feel like. Hence, although the physical bodies are not \npresent in cyberspace, the body still does matter. \n \nOnline Flirting: New Rules \nThe obvious question then arises as to how the body might translate to online Internet \nflirting. How might we conceptualize flirting online? When interacting in cyberspace \nthrough text only (I deliberately place an emphasis here on text only, given that, with \nthe change in technology, such as webcams, there will be more opportunities to \nwitness the \u2018real body\u2019 online), none of the offline flirting signals described \npreviously are physically present. There is not an actual physical body to provide \nthese non-verbal signals of sexual interest. For flirting to occur in cyberspace the \nbody needs to be represented through text. If one studies Internet activity, it does \nappear that some basic rules about online flirting are emerging, and indeed we find \nsome evidence for how the body may be reconstructed via text. \nFor instance, rather than make an effort to look good, individuals can create a \nlasting first impression by describing how attractive they look. This is not necessarily \na description of our actual bodies. Cyberspace allows us, through text, to create new \nattractive bodies. Indeed, we can devise an entirely new attractive being, one that has \na good job, a self that earns huge sums of money, and is well educated. \nDemure glances and eyebrow flashes are not easily replicated online. \nHowever, there are some alternatives to these non-verbal gestures. For example, \nemoticons, which are drawings made from grammatical symbols, might be a useful \nalternative. We can use facial expressions such as smiley faces, winks and kisses as a \nsubstitute for body language. Moreover, rather than use audible laughing and \ngiggling, individuals can use acronyms, such as LOL (laugh out loud or lots of \nlaughs) and < BG> (Big Grin). Screen names are another device people can add to \ntheir repertoire of online flirting behaviours. \nSome offline flirting behaviours are not so easy to translate online. For \nexample, it is difficult to find substitutes, or an equivalence, for olfactics, vocalics and \nproxemics. Online participants do not know what the person they are chatting with \nsmells like, nor are they allured by their sexy deep voice. Chatting with CAPITALS \nIS CONSIDERED TO BE SHOUTING! However, the subtleties of voice, such as \npitch and tone, are not evident online. Pauses in conversation might be attributed to a \npoor Internet connection, or bad typing skills, as opposed to a lack of interest. \nIndividuals also cannot indicate attraction online by leaning closer to one another or \nby mirroring their body movements. Moreover, in revisiting Givens\u2019 (1978) phases of \ncourting, we find that the stages that occur offline are not as distinctive online. \nInstead, these appear to merge into one phase, given that the reconstruction of the \nbody that is occurring online is interwoven throughout the conversation that has \nalready been initiated. \n \nOnline Flirting: Playing at Love \nIn addition to pointing out the differences in how one is able to flirt online in \ncomparison to offline, I want to propose here another important distinction between \nthe two activities, that is, that cyber-flirting can be understood as a type of play. \n(Notwithstanding the possibility that other types of play are also available in \ncyberspace, an in-depth discussion of this kind is beyond \nthe scope of this paper.)  \nAlthough play is an activity typically associated with childhood, some \nresearchers have also focused on play in adulthood. For example, Carr (in press) has \nargued that play exists in work settings. He has explained that although play can be a \nmeans to some other end, it is also an activity that is enjoyable in itself. In addition to \nthis view of play, Abramis (1990) has proposed that another type of play is simply \n\u2018goofing around\u2019. \nIn considering play, I would like to draw from a psychoanalytic perspective. A \npsychodynamic view of play emphasizes the importance of the ephemeral quality of \nillusion in play (Modell, 1990). As Carr (in press) states: \nThose who champion a psychoanalytic approach to the understanding of play \ninsist that play is all about illusion and that such illusion can only be sustained \nprovided play can be kept within a frame of its own\u2014a frame which seeks to \nseparate it from ordinary life. \nModell (1990) has also stressed the importance of considering play as separate from \nordinary life. Play can be separated from ordinary life, in a \nnumber of ways, as he has explained: \nPlaying takes place in a certain space and has certain limitations regarding the \nduration of time, as in games that are \u2018played out\u2019 within a certain limit of \ntime. Yet playing may have its own quality of timelessness. Playing is also \nseparated from ordinary life by the \u2018rules of the game\u2019: all play has its rules \nthat pertain to the temporary world in which playing takes place. Rules are in \neffect a means of containing a space in which illusions can flourish. (p. 27) \nIn respect to cyber-flirting, this is an activity separate from ordinary life. For \nexample, as was outlined above, given the absence of non-verbal offline cues, new \nrules are required to enable one to flirt online. In addition, a certain amount of illusion \nneeds to be sustained in order for the activity to take place, given that this is an \ninteraction between characters that are reconstructed through text. \nIt has been observed that some relationships that begin on the Internet often \nextend beyond the net (e.g., Parks & Floyd, 1996; Parks & Roberts, 1998; Whitty & \nGavin, 2001). It could, therefore, be argued that the \u2018game is over\u2019 or playing has \nceased once the couple decides to introduce more social cues to the interaction. This \nis not to say that cyber-interactions are not intimate, but rather the illusion of the body \nthat was constructed through the text becomes deconstructed once more is known \nabout the \u2018actual\u2019 body. In fact, my own research has identified that some \nrelationships seem to work better exclusively on the Internet (Whitty & Gavin, 2001). \nFor example, this 18-year-old woman in our study stated that: \nIt developed through an interesting chat on IRC and a series of about 500 e-\nmails. The attraction was merely someone who cared and listened. He was \nvery sensitive and caring, and his picture was hot! {laughs} . . . we exchanged \naddresses and he sent me presents on Valentines Day and Easter. We would \nwrite a two page e-mail every day, send sounds to each other, and eventually \nafter six months we talked on the phone. Our phone conversation was very \nweak so we decided to stick to e-mail . . . (p. 628) \nIn this woman\u2019s case, perhaps the illusion of the person that was constructed through \ntext was spoilt once she was exposed to the actual person. As Modell (1990) and Carr \n(in press) comment, play is ephemeral and separate from ordinary life. Moving to \nanother mode of communication for this woman might have meant \u2018game over\u2019. \n \nApplying Winnicott\u2019s Notions of Play to Cyberspace \nWinnicott (1971\/1997) also believed that play is as an important activity during \nadulthood. He stated that: \u2018Whatever I say about children playing really applies to \nadults as well\u2019 (p. 40). In line with Freud\u2019s view on play, Winnicott argued that \u2018play \ntranscended the serious and non-serious oppositional binary\u2019 (Carr, 2001, p. 544). \nWinnicott\u2019s significant contributions to a psychoanalytic perspective of play are \ndrawn upon here to explain how the Internet offers a unique space to play at love. \nWinnicott (1971\/1997) was very interested in the \u2018potential space\u2019 between \nthe mother and the infant. He contrasted this \u2018potential space (a) with the inner world \n(which is related to the psychosomatic partnership) and (b) with actual, or external \nreality\u2019 (p. 41). Winnicott understood \u2018potential spaces\u2019 to be spaces where \nconnections may be maintained between an external world and an internal conception \nof self; the space between the subject and object. To quote from Winnicott \n(1971\/1997), potential space is \n. . . the hypothetical area that exists (but cannot exist) between the baby and \nthe object (mother or part of mother) during the phase of the repudiation of the \nobject as not-me, that is, at the end of being merged in with the object. (p. \n107) \nAlthough potential space originates between the mother and the infant, \nWinnicott argues that later on it becomes possible for the individual child or adult to \ndevelop his\/her own capacity to generate potential space. For example, he proposed \nthat such spaces could exist between the patient and analyst. While Winnicott could \nbe criticized for developing a universal assumption about the relationship between the \nmother and infant, his notions are still highly useful. \nAccording to Winnicott, potential space is the place where play takes place \nand creativity becomes possible. As he expresses it: \nThe place where cultural experience is located is in the potential space \nbetween the individual and the environment (originally the object). The same \ncan be said of playing. Cultural experience begins with creative living first \nmanifested in play. (p. 100) \nIt is critical to our understanding of Winnicott\u2019s work to note that potential space is \nnot inner psychic reality. Rather, as he understood it, potential space \u2018is outside the \nindividual, but it is not the external world. . . . Into this play area the child gathers \nobjects or phenomena from external reality and uses these in the services of . . . inner \nor personal reality\u2019 (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, \np. 51). \nAs illustrated in the above quote, potential space is not pure fantasy, nor is it \npure reality. As Ogden (1985) has expressed it, \u2018In the absence of potential space, \nthere is only fantasy; within potential space imagination can develop\u2019 (p. 133). It is in \nthis space that meanings and self are continually being created and re-created. \nInterestingly, Winnicott (1971\/1997) strongly argued that \u2018it is only in being creative \nthat the individual discovers the self\u2019 (p. 54). Hence, he believed that play is central to \nindividual growth. He stated that, given a \u2018good enough\u2019 environment, the interplay of \nthe inner world and external reality promotes the development of self and facilitates \ngrowth. \nIn other words, it is play that is the universal, and that belongs to health: \nplaying facilitates growth and therefore health; playing leads into group \nrelationships; playing can be a form of communication in psychotherapy; and \nlastly, psychoanalysis has been developed as a highly specialized form of \nplaying in the service of communication with oneself and others. (p.41) \nOthers too have suggested that play is fundamental to the development of self. \nMos and Boodt (1991) state that \u2018Play is directed towards an understanding of one\u2019s \npersonal growth and the acceptance of the uniqueness of others. In whatever human \nendeavor, play comes to express the drama and tragedy and the suffering and joy of \nhuman existence\u2019 (p. 139). \nIn line with Winnicott\u2019s theoretical conception of play, I would argue that \ncyberspace could be understood as potential space. As elucidated in Gibson\u2019s fictional \nwork, cyberspace is a place where people are liberated to be whoever they want to be. \nGibson himself perceives cyberspace as a \u2018hyper-reality\u2019. Cyberspace is perhaps a \nspace somewhere outside the individual, but it is still not the external world. The \nparticipants, the \ncomputers, monitors, keyboards, mice, software, modems, text, cables, telephone \nlines, and so forth, all occupy this potential space, this space between the \u2018real \nindividuals\u2019 and the \u2018fantasy individuals\u2019. Indeed the web might be conceptualized as \na potential playground. \nIt is contended here that flirting is a type of play that can occur in this \npotential space\u2014cyberspace. Playing at love on the Internet, although synonymous in \nsome ways with offline flirting, is characterized here as a unique activity that is a \nform of play. There is greater opportunity online for fantasy than there is offline. \nOnline participants can inhabit any body they desire, whether that is a youthful body, \nan attractive body or even a body of the opposite sex. In recent research, I have found \nthat men, in particular, swap genders online (Whitty, 2001, 2002). Moreover, the \nparticipant can invent what their fantasy partner looks like, feels like, and feels about \nthem. Participants can fantasize that they are attracted to others, and, in turn, others \nare attracted to them. \nTherefore, as argued earlier in this paper, while clearly the body is not physically \npresent during online interactions, it still does matter. In this \u2018potential space\u2019, \nparticipants can play with a variety of identities, including their physical identity. This \nis illustrated in the following extract from an interview I conducted with a 22-year-old \nman (in a previous study) who discussed how he flirted on the web: \nThey all think I\u2019m a six foot tall tanned lifesaver. I tell them certain things that \nare true, but other things are bullshit. I mean, I can get away with it so why \nnot. What they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them. I will admit that I am pretty sly \nwhen it comes to smooth talking certain ladies on the net. (Whitty & Gavin, \n2001, p. 629) \nIn this participant\u2019s case it would be difficult to play with being a six-foot tanned \nlifesaver in a face-to-face interaction if his \u2018real\u2019 physical body was that of an obese, \npale, five-foot-tall individual. This type of flirtation is clearly different to offline \nflirting. However, despite the differences, this example does illustrate the importance \nof considering the reconstruction of \nthe body online rather than emphasizing the absence of body. In what ways the body \nis reconstructed in this play should be of interest to researchers. For instance, what \ndoes it mean for this young man to play with inhabiting a stereotypical Australian \nattractive body? How else has he re-created his body online? How has this altered his \ndialogue with others? Therefore, rather than arguing that one can interact without the \nbody online, it is more meaningful to question how one can play with one\u2019s body in \nthis potential space. \nIn addition to playing with the shape and form of one\u2019s own physical \nbody, cyberspace provides an opportunity to play with other bodies. The following \nquote from another 18-year-old woman illustrates how one might play with other \nbodies in this potential space: \nUsually I just block out the photo they have sent me if I don\u2019t like it and just \npretend they look a certain way. It\u2019s more fun that way! (Whitty & Gavin, \n2000) \nThis quote is contrary to the view that the Internet is simply a place for a meeting of \nminds. Rather, it demonstrates that even in cyberspace the body plays an important \nrole. This is again supported in the following statement by a 21-year-old man: \nWell you always wanna know what the other person looks like and you\u2019re \nalways hoping for it to be some good-looking chick. \nInterestingly, in response to whether he would continue communicating with a \nwoman who turned out to be unattractive, this man stated: \nWell then yeah in that case I would still talk to them but I know that I would \nchange towards them . . . Like I wouldn\u2019t be flirty or anything like that. \n(Whitty & Gavin, 2000) \nAitken and Herman (1997) have proposed that Winnicott\u2019s framework \n\u2018allows the possibility of a flexible manipulation of meanings and relationships\u2019 (p. \n11). They argue that objects, cultural practices and self-images may become elements \nof this space. Moreover, they suggest that these elements can be altered \u2018as an \nindividual adjusts and updates knowledge throughout a lifetime\u2019 (p. 11). Indeed play \ncan challenge society\u2019s rules. In Winnicott\u2019s potential space, reality is plastic and \nmeanings can be reconstituted. Applying this to cyberspace, stereotypical gender roles \ncan be challenged by playing online. For example, women might initiate \nconversation, and men might utilize more facial signals, in the form of emoticons, to \nflirt with. It could therefore be argued that this potential space allows one to play and \nexperiment with traditional cultural meanings of the self and gender. An individual \ncan play, by trying out different identities, to discover, to use Winnicott\u2019s terms, what \nis \u2018me\u2019 and what is \u2018not-me\u2019. This type of play has significant implications for \ntherapeutic outcomes, and, of course, the potential for psychopathologies to develop \nfrom this activity cannot be discounted. \nGermane to Winnicott\u2019s argument is that potential space is a safe space, a \nplace where one can be spontaneous and experimentation can take place. He argues \nthat in order for one to play there needs to be trust. For example, he argues that if \npsychotherapy is to be successful, \u2018playing has to be spontaneous, and not compliant \nor acquiescent\u2019 (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 51). In line with these qualities of potential \nspace, cyberspace potentially provides a safer space than offline space in which to \nplay and experiment at flirting. Rejection is less likely to cause distress when you can \ndisconnect at any time, and the chances are remarkably decreased as to the likelihood \nof ever having a chance meeting with your cyber-playmate. Moreover, there are more \nopportunities for an individual to be creative and experiment with flirting online. As \nis elucidated in Gibson\u2019s fictional work, cyberspace offers us the opportunity to create \nand play with different selves. For example, MUDs (multiple-user dungeons, or more \ncommonly understood these days to mean multi-user dimensions) were originally \nspaces where interactive role-playing games could be played, very similar to \nDungeons and Dragons. Presently, hundreds of MUDs are available on the Internet. \nThese are often based on popular science-fiction\/fantasy; however, there are \nnumerous MUDs where people get together and socialize. What is evidenced here is \npeople experimenting with and playing with multiple characters. In the Winnicottian \nsense, this can be conceived as playing at discovering what is \u2018me\u2019 and what is \u2018not-\nme\u2019. \nWinnicott also employed the term \u2018transitional objects\u2019 in his theorizing about \nplay. He observed that infants often become fond of a special object, such as a teddy \nbear, a doll or a blanket, as if addicted to this object. The infant develops an \nattachment to this object, and might suck the object, or suck their thumb or fingers \nwhile holding the object. This object Winnicott named the \u2018transitional object\u2019, or the \n\u2018not-me\u2019 object. What he means by the \u2018transitional object\u2019 in the case of the child \nsucking a blanket or some other object is that it is an object that is not the breast but \nthat treating it as such allows the infant to make a distinction between the \u2018me\u2019 and \nthe \u2018notme\u2019. In respect to play, Winnicott (1971\/1997) asserted that \u2018when we witness \nan infant\u2019s employment of a transitional object, the first not-me possession, we are \nwitnessing both the child\u2019s first use of a symbol and the first experience of play\u2019 (p. \n96). Applying this to cyber-flirting, the \u2018hardware\u2019 of the Internet could be examples \nof transitional objects, i.e. the computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, software, \nmodems, text, cables, telephone lines, that allow forms of play. \nBollas\u2019s (1992) extensions on Winnicott\u2019s work can also add to our \nunderstanding of flirting in cyberspace. He has suggested that, \n. . . as we encounter the object world we are substantially metamorphosed by \nthe structure of objects; internally transformed by objects that leave their \ntraces within us, whether it be the effect of a musical structure, a novel, or a \nperson. In play the subject releases the idiom of himself to the field of objects, \nwhere he is then transformed by the structure of that experience, and will bear \nthe history of that encounter in the unconscious. (p. 59) \nIn other words, Bollas is arguing that transitional objects, like all objects, \n\u2018leave a trace\u2019 within us. He believes that when we use some objects, \u2018it is as if we \nknow the terms of engagement\u2019 (p. 60). As Carr (in press) explains it: \u2018Some objects \nseem to have much more inner meaning for us and unlock unconscious thought \nprocesses and affective states.\u2019 In respect to online interactions, it may be that the \ntransitional objects such as the computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, modems, and \nso forth, \u2018leave a trace\u2019 within us. \nOnce we log on, it is as if we must acknowledge \u2018the rules\u2019 of the game of \ncyber-flirting. Playing at love online is restrained by certain rules. Some of these rules \nhave been imposed from people\u2019s understandings of offline flirting; however, many \nnew rules have evolved in order for online interactions to take place (as described in \nan earlier section of this paper). One also needs to acknowledge that part of the \nleaving of a trace may be such that individuals simply touching their computer or \nthinking about going online triggers certain emotions. For example, Lupton (1995) \ndescribes the effect turning on the computer has on her: \nWhen I turn on my personal computer . . . it makes a little sound. This little \nsound I sometimes playfully interpret as a cheerful \u2018Good morning\u2019 greeting, \nfor the action of bringing my computer to life usually happens first thing in the \nmorning . . . .In conjunction with my cup of tea, the sound helps to prepare me \nemotionally and physically for the working day ahead, a day that will involve \nmuch tapping on the computer keyboard and staring into the pale blue face of \nthe display monitor. (p. 97) \nThus a very embodied response to the object itself is a matter that needs to \nbe recognized in our theorizing about the Internet. \nWinnicott argued that normally the transitional object provides a healthy \nexperience, which loses its meaning after a while. He believed that the first \n\u2018transitional object\u2019 stood for the breast in an illusory way (Winnicott, 1953). Later on \nin a child\u2019s life, he suggested that objects, such as toys, represent body parts. \nProblems can arise, however, if attachment to a transitional object persists for too \nlong. Winnicott (1971\/1997) proposed that the \u2018transitional object may eventually \ndevelop into a fetish object and so persist as a characteristic of the adult sexual life\u2019 \n(p. 9). As Pierloot (1988) describes it, \u2018it can persist in pathological states such as the \ntalisman of obsessional rituals, in addictions, lying and stealing\u2019 (p. 298). It might be \nthe case that playing at cyber-flirting for too long may cease to be a healthy \nexperience. For example, Cooper, Putnam, Planchon and Boies (1999) have identified \na certain kind of person who would never have developed a sexual addiction if it were \nnot for the Internet. Perhaps in these individuals\u2019 cases the transitional object (the \ncomputer) eventually developed into a fetish object. \nBollas\u2019 (1992) notion of generational objects has relevance to this paper. He \ncontends that: \nWere we to study this psychology of generations closely, it would be of \ninterest to contrast the nature of generational potential spaces, to note those \nobjects selected as signature of a generation\u2019s consciousness, and to analyse \nthe field of such objects as unconscious ideas that may be generative or \npathological. (p. 266) \nHe states that generational objects weave into historical time, and argues that \n\u2018[g]enerations form objects that signify the history of childhoods, that speak to the \ncollective march through time of a vast group expecting and expected to shape \nhistory\u2019 (p. 267). Although it is too early to tell, in decades to come we might look \nback over objects such as computers, modems, keyboards, and so forth, and, in \nretrospect, see these items are signifying meaning for a particular generation in \nhistory. Cyberspace might not always provide the potential space for playing at love \nas described in this paper. \n \nMagic Realism \nPlay is immensely exciting. It is exciting not primarily because the instincts \nare involved, be it understood! The thing about playing is always the \nprecariousness of the interplay of personal psychic reality and the experience \nof control of actual objects. This is the precariousness of magic itself, magic \nthat arises in intimacy, in a relationship that is being found to be reliable. \n(Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 47) \nAgain taking our cue from Winnicott, I would like to conclude this paper with the \nproposition that the term magic realism is a potentially important notion to consider in \nunderstanding cyber-flirting. Carr (in press) has defined magic realism as \u2018a form of \nrepresentation that juxtaposes reality and fantasy\u2019. Latin American writers such as \nGabriel Garcia M\u00b4arquez and Carlos Fuentes have written stories employing this \nmethod of magic realism: that is, stories that have realistic elements, but also contain \nfictional events and situations that are impossible. Carr (in press) argues that \u2018magic \nrealism, as a form of play, affords us the opportunity to see again elements of our \nworld that we have either taken for granted or never recognized in the first place\u2019. As \nwith Winnicott\u2019s potential space, magic realism combines fantastic and realistic \nelements. \nMagic realism, as a form of play, is evident in cyber-flirting. The Internet \nis a place where there is a blurring of the boundaries between reality and fantasy. Carr \n(2001) has stated that: \nIt is by recasting the everyday experiences, and the ordinary, in a way as to \nbecome extraordinary, that the hidden, the neglected the suppressed and the \nrepressed may gain a \u2018new\u2019 appearance and new possibilities might be \nliberated from the activity of this \u2018new recognition\u2019. (p. 547) \nIndeed, both fantastic and realistic elements are present when people flirt online. \nRealistic elements are evident in the text that online participants construct. For \nexample, as described earlier on in this paper, in order to flirt participants need to \ndescribe smiling, laughter and even touch. Another realistic aspect is the emotions \ngenerated from this play. In contrast, the fantastic elements include how they re-create \nthe body they inhabit and their identity. This is evident in the imaginative play of \nindividuals, who are free to create new selves. This process is magical since the \nindividual is not restricted to describing what they actually look like, or their actual \nself, but \nrather they can play with a possible or ideal self. \nWhat makes cyber-flirting a unique experience compared to offline flirtation \nis that when we consider the physical sense of reality, these events are not actually \noccurring. Hence, like the magic realism technique employed by novelists, reality and \nfantasy are indeed parallel. Unlike offline flirting, when one flirts online, there is no \npossibility for physical intimacy at the end of the evening. However, to reiterate, \ndespite this lack of physical connection between bodies, the body still does play a \ncrucial role in cyberflirting, the difference being that online the participant is free to \ncreate this body. Again the point being emphasized here is that cyberspace is a place \nfor bodies. \nDrawing once more from Winnicott, the transitional objects involved in cyber-\nflirting could be said to have their own magic value and force: for example, the \nmagical qualities the participant might ascribe to the computer as colourfully \ndescribed by Lupton earlier on in this paper. Objects can take on new meanings, and \nin this way a new understanding of the self might emerge. In Winnicottian terms, \nplaying with what is \u2018me\u2019 and not-me\u2019 can take place in this space, which is separate \nfrom ordinary life. For instance, individuals can experiment with being a successful \nattractive lover, so long as this illusion remains in this magical realm of cyberspace. \n \nConclusion \nIn conclusion, it is argued that Winnicott\u2019s notions of potential space and transitional \nobjects are useful terms to employ to make sense of flirting in cyberspace. Although \nonline flirting is based on elements of a physical reality, an illusion needs to be \nsustained in this space in order for flirtatious interactions to take place. It also needs \nto be recognized that although this paper describes possibilities that cyberspace could \noffer the participant who desires to \u2018play at love\u2019, it could nevertheless be the case \nthat players do not take advantage of the opportunities that the Internet affords. \nEmpirical research into how participants actually flirt online has yet to be undertaken. \nNevertheless, this paper does highlight an alternative view on the construction of \ncyberspace, the importance of consideration to the reconstruction of the body online, \nand a theoretical framework for understanding playing at love on the Internet. \n  \nReferences \nAbramis, D.
