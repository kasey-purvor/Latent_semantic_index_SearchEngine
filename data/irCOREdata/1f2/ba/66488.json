From their analysis, we conclude that an electron channeling mechanism, due\nto strong specular reflection of the minority spin carrier at the Au\u0001Fe interfaces, is responsible for the\nhigh conductivity in the (100) superlattices.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.86.5787 PACS numbers: 75.70.Cn, 73.40.\u2013c, 73.50.\u2013h, 75.70.Pa\nThe theory of the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is still\ndeveloping [1,2] and a number [3] of recent papers have\ninteresting predictions about the nature of the electronic\nstates in multilayers. In particular, the band structure that\ngives rise to spin-dependent scattering is thought to be re-\nsponsible [4] for the spin-dependent confinement of elec-\ntrons to specific layers within the system. A potential step\ncan exist at the interface between the ferromagnetic layer\nand the nonmagnetic layer. This potential in the hybridized\nband structure affects the transmission of electrons through\nthe interface. It should be possible, therefore, for electrons\nto scatter specularly from such an interface, and theoretical\nwork has predicted the effect on the transport [5\u201310] and\ncoupling properties in superlattices [11\u201313].\nThis type of specular reflection is quite distinct from that\nexplored experimentally by Egelhoff et al. [14], Swagten\net al. [15], and Yuasa et al. [16] where electrons are specu-\nlarly scattered from an insulator or noble metal\/vacuum\ninterface. In true channeling the electron is confined to a\nlayer within the material as a result of the band structure.\nStates are completely reflecting if there are no states in the\nother material with the same parallel momentum. Addi-\ntionally, at points of high symmetry, the effectiveness of\ncoupling between s-p states of the spacer and the d states\nof the ferromagnet become important and lead to high re-\nflection probabilities that are different for majority and mi-\nnority carriers. When the magnetic moments in adjacent\nlayers are parallel, one spin can have a high specular reflec-\ntion coefficient at both interfaces and the spacer acts as an\nelectron waveguide. If this spacer has a significantly lower\nresistivity than the magnetic layer, the channeled electrons\nwill act as a low resistance shunt and thus enhance the\nGMR. In the antiparallel state, there is no confinement in\nthe Au spacer.\nAccording to the theory of Stiles [7], the Fe\u0001Au (100)\nsystem is a good candidate in which to observe electron\nchanneling. The probabilities for transmission into the Fe\nfrom the Au are 67% higher for majority carriers compared\nto the minority carriers. For transmission from the Fe into\nthe Au, the majority carriers have a 21% higher probabil-\nity of transmission. On the other hand, the minority elec-\ntrons are largely confined to each material. The orientation\nbetween the successive magnetic moments in a multilayer\ngreatly affects the channeling. Only in the saturated state\nwhere all magnetic moments are aligned can the channel-\ning occur. Also, the channeling is related to the symmetry\nof the Fermi surface and therefore to the epitaxial relation-\nship in the superlattice. Large channeling effects are pre-\ndicted for (100) Fe\u0001Au, whereas the Fe\u0001Au(111) system\nis not expected to exhibit channeling as the band mismatch\nis so large [17].\nIn this Letter, we present experimental evidence for this\nmechanism in (100) oriented Fe\u0001Au multilayers grown by\nmolecular beam epitaxy [18]. The key experiments involve\nthe study of the variation of conductivity and structural\nperfection as a function of the thickness of the Au layers.\nFe\u0001Au multilayers consisting of 20 repeats of a \u0002Fe\u000310 \u00c5\u0004\u0001\nAu\u0003X\u0004\u0005 structure, where X represents a thickness between\n5 and 70 \u00c5, were grown on a 50 \u00c5 Au buffer layer. In situ\nreflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) mea-\nsurements and high resolution x-ray diffraction data from\nBragg planes parallel to the surface showed that multilay-\ners grown on polished (100) faces of MgO (with a 10 \u00c5\nFe seed layer) were epitaxial with (100) orientation, while\nthose grown on \u0003112\u00af0\u0004 sapphire (with a 30 \u00c5 Nb seed\nlayer) were (111) oriented. The existence of superlattice\nsatellites up to the seventh order around the 200 and 111\nx-ray Bragg peaks for the respective systems showed\nthat the interfaces were extremely sharp. Analysis of the\ndiffraction peak widths in reciprocal space scans of 30 \u00c5\nbilayer samples gives a lower limit to the out-of-plane sub-\ngrain size of 150 6 20 \u00c5 and 570 6 50 \u00c5 in the (100)\nand (111) systems, respectively. In these samples, for both\norientations, there are many interfaces contained within\neach subgrain. It is important for the transport data pre-\nsented later to note that we find the out-of-plane structure\nfor the (111) samples to be of much higher quality than\nthe (100) samples.\nOscillations, as a function of Au spacer thickness, in\nGMR (measured using a four-probe dc method at 4.2 K)\nand in the remanent magnetization were observed in the\n(100) orientation only. Our measured values of 15 6 2 \u00c5\n0031-9007\u000101\u000186(25)\u00015787(4)$15.00 \u00a9 2001 The American Physical Society 5787\nVOLUME 86, NUMBER 25 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 18 JUNE 2001\nand 7 6 2 \u00c5 for the period of the exchange coupling com-\npare well with predicted values of 17.2 \u00c5 and 5.0 \u00c5 [19]\nand those determined elsewhere [20,21]. However, the de-\ncay length of the coupling strength, as a function of spacer,\nthickness was unusually long. Several theoretical papers\nhave predicted that the amplitude of exchange coupling is\na function of the extent of electron confinement [11\u201313].\nThere was no coupling observed in the (111) samples and\na maximum GMR of only 6% was found compared to 40%\nfor the (100) samples with antiferromagnetic coupling.\nThe residual resistivity ratios for our Fe\u0001Au systems are\ntypical of multilayers [22] and depend on Au thickness for\nboth orientations. The values for Au layers less than 2 nm\nare 2 for (100) and 1.4 for (111) and for the thicker samples\nwith Au of 6 nm we found 3.4 for (100) and 1.9 for (111).\nThe conductivity at 4.2 K, measured in a saturating\nmagnetic field of 1 T, as a function of Au spacer thickness\nis shown in Fig. 1. The conductivity of a single bilayer\nof \u0002Au\u00031000 \u00c5\u0004\u0001Fe\u000310 \u00c5\u0004\u0005 has been measured as 0.88 6\n0.05\u0003mV cm\u000421 in the (100) orientation and 0.73 6\n0.04\u0003mV cm\u000421 in the (111) orientation. It is immedi-\nately apparent that the data from Fig. 1 should saturate,\nfor large Au thickness, at roughly the same value, i.e.,\nthe conductivity of thick Au. We have found that while\nthe (111) data can be explained in the Fuchs-Sondheimer\nmodel [23], the (100) data cannot, for any reasonable\nvalues of the Fe or Au conductivities. If electrons were to\ntraverse many layers without scattering, the conductivity\nwould depend on the average scattering properties of\nmany Au and Fe layers and would not vary strongly with\nthe thickness of the Au(100) spacer. However, if electron\nchanneling exists in the (100) Au spacers, the mean-free\npath of the specularly reflected electrons may be long,\nleading to a high conductivity, without electrons crossing a\nlarge number of layers.

Provided the mean-free path\nin the Au layer, lAu, is greater than the thickness of the\nAu, the mean-free path is directly proportional to the\nproduct of the number of specular reflections and the Au\nthickness: lAu ~ NtAu. The total conductivity, s, mea-\nsured in plane is then the thickness-weighted sum of the\nconductivities of the individual Fe and Au layers, namely,\ns \u0001\n20zNt2Au\nttot\n1\n20tFe\nttot\nsFe , (1)\nwhere tAu and tFe are the thicknesses of Au and Fe layers,\nttot is the total multilayer thickness, sFe is the conductivity\nof the Fe layers, and z represents the usual constants from\nthe Drude formula. Solid lines in Fig. 1 represent fits using\nEq. (1) assuming that z is the same for all samples, inde-\npendent of Au thickness and multilayer orientation. The\nonly free parameter is the value of N and we find that\nthe ratio of specular reflection coefficients between orien-\ntations N100\u0001N111 is 2.7 6 0.1 with N100 equal to 9.\nTo go beyond this phenomenological model which as-\nsumes a spin-independent electron confinement, we have\nused the semiclassical model proposed by Hood and Fali-\ncov [4] to determine the saturation conductivity in an\ninfinite \u0002Fe\u000310 \u00c5\u0004\u0001Au\u0003X \u00c5\u0004\u0005 multilayer as a function of\nX. The conductivity has been calculated with and without\nspecular reflections assuming spin-dependent scattering\nprobabilities in the bulk and at the interfaces.\nThe spin-dependent relaxation time and potential of the\nlayer were varied to keep the conductivity equal to that\nmeasured in the bulk. At the interface, three possible cases\nare distinguished: transmission (T ), specular reflection\n(R), and diffuse scattering (D), where T 1 R 1 D \u0001 1.\nThe values of T and R are determined by the layer po-\ntentials and D was set as 0.3 for all layers. We have set\nthe potential of the Au layer in agreement with the free\nelectron value of the Fermi energy. In order to confine the\nelectrons, the potential in the Fe must be varied. As ex-\npected, free electron values of the Fermi energy for Fe do\nnot work and, therefore, to introduce confinement in the\nAu, the potentials for majority and minority carriers in Fe\nare changed in order to reproduce the value of R and T\npredicted by Stiles.\nWithin the model we find that without electron confine-\nment the (100) Au conductivity must be 25 times higher\nthan the (111) Au to explain the experimental data. This is\nunreasonable considering the structural data and the mea-\nsured conductivities. We therefore fixed the conductivities\nof layers in each orientation to be equal to the measured\nvalues and then switched on the channeling for the (100)\nsamples. The results are shown as squares in Fig. 1. The\nagreement with the experimental data is very good when\nthe probability of specular reflection is set to 0.6 for mi-\nnority electrons and 0.3 for the majority electrons, which\nis close to the values predicted by Stiles [7]. We also found\nthat varyingD, the diffuse scatter at the interface, could not\n5788\nVOLUME 86, NUMBER 25 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 18 JUNE 2001\naccount for the data. We conclude, therefore, that channel-\ning is required to explain the observed differences in the\nconductivity of (100) and (111) superlattices.\nWe have undertaken extensive structural measurements\nto demonstrate the validity of the above analysis which\nassumes no significant change in the structural quality of\nthe samples with Au thickness. In-plane diffraction mea-\nsurements have been carried out in situ using reflection\nhigh-energy electron diffraction and ex situ using grazing\nincidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD). To perform an in situ\nRHEED analysis, the growth of an 80 \u00c5 Au layer on 10 \u00c5\nof Fe has been interrupted at different stages. The patterns\nexhibit fine and continuous streaks characteristic of a 2D\nwell ordered Au surface, which is expected from the differ-\nence of free surface energy of the materials. The full width\nat half maximum (FWHM) of the streaks is a measure of\nthe in-plane coherence length. As can be seen in Fig. 2,\nthis was found to be constant in both of the orientations\nfor Au layers thicker than 30 \u00c5, where the conductivity in\nFig. 1 shows significant dependence on the Au thickness.\nFor thick Au, the coherence length of the (111) samples\nwas slightly larger than the (100).\nGrazing incidence x-ray diffraction experiments have\nbeen performed on BM28, the XMaS CRG beam line, at\nthe European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble.\nIn the GIXD geometry, the diffracting planes are perpen-\ndicular to the sample surface and the diffraction peaks mea-\nsured by rotation of sample and detector about the normal\nto the surface. It is therefore sensitive to in-plane structure\nand disorder in the Au and Fe layers. Use of a grazing\nangle of the incident beam below the critical angle (in our\nexperiments 0.2\u00b1) limits the depth sensitivity to approxi-\nmately 30 \u00c5. The FWHM of the in-plane u-2u scans are\n0.5\u00b1 0.8\u00b1 for the (111) and 0.2\u00b1 for the (100) orientation\nsamples, respectively. Figure 3 shows u scans of scattered\nintensity as a function of the specimen angle about its sur-\nface normal taken with the detector at the Au (022) re-\nflection position. The four- and sixfold symmetries show\nthe Au layers to be deposited with well-defined (100) and\n(111) orientation in the MgO and sapphire systems, re-\nspectively. The FWHM of the peaks of Fig. 3 provides a\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n20 40 60 80\n(100)\n(111)\nAu thickness (\u00c5)In\npl\nan\ne\nco\nhe\nre\nn\nce\nle\nng\nth\n(\u00c5\n)\nFIG. 2. In-plane coherence length, determined from the width\nof RHEED streaks, as a function of the Au thickness and of the\norientation.\ndirect measure of the mosaic width of in-plane crystalline\ndisorder. For the (100) samples, the mosaicity width was\nfound to vary from 0.49\u00b1 to 0.47\u00b1 for Au layer thicknesses\nbetween 35 and 70 \u00c5, whereas for (111) the widths varied\nfrom 2.35\u00b1 to 2.02\u00b1. The absence of variation of rock-\ning curve FWHM with thickness in the (100) samples is\nstrong evidence against defect scattering being responsible\nfor the change in the conductivity [24]. High angle x-ray\ndiffraction rocking curves of these samples [25] show that\nthe in-plane scattering domain (subgrain) size of the (111)\norientation is about 2\u20133 times that of the (100) orientation.\nThe lower conductivity of the (111) samples cannot there-\nfore be attributed to increased grain boundary scattering.\nThe specular reflectivity data show Kiessig fringes and\nBragg peaks for both (100) and (111) epilayers, and the\nnominal thickness was found to be in good agreement with\nthat deduced from the x-ray results. Kiessig fringes and\nBragg peaks were also observed in the off-specular radial\nscans, indicating that a large proportion of the interface\nroughness is correlated (conformal) through the multilayer.\nThe thickness of individual layers, the electron density gra-\ndient, conformal and random roughness, in-plane rough-\nness correlation length \u0003j\u0004, and Hirst fractal parameter,\nh, were obtained by matching the experimental data to\nthat simulated for a fractal model structure within the dis-\ntorted wave Born approximation [26,27]. Excellent agree-\nment is found between experimental and simulated data for\ntransverse \u0003qy\u0004 scans, with good reproducibility between\nsamples. For the (111) Fe\u0001Au epilayers grown on sapphire\nwe find (Fig. 4a) that the interface roughness is highly cor-\nrelated in nature with a correlated-to-uncorrelated rough-\nness ratio close to 16:1. The lateral correlation length, j, is\ndetermined to be 250 6 20 \u00c5 with a fractal Hirst parame-\nter h \u0001 0.20 6 0.05. The (100) Fe\u0001Au grown on MgO\nalso exhibits an interface roughness which is highly corre-\nlated in nature. Matching of simulated and experimental\ndata (Fig. 4b) yields a correlated-to-uncorrelated rough-\nness ratio of 10:1 and a lateral correlation length j \u0001\n250 6 20 \u00c5, with a fractal parameter h \u0001 0.28 6 0.05.\nAs the fractal parameter varies from 0 to 1 on moving from\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n- 100 0 10 0\n(111)\n(100)\nSample rotation angle (degrees)\nN\nor\nm\nal\nise\nd \nin\nte\nns\nity\n (a\nrb.\n un\nits\n)\nFIG. 3.

In all layers measured, the rms\namplitude of the roughness in the (100) system is almost\n3 times that of the (111) system, (9.3 6 0.2 \u00c5 compared\nwith 3.3 6 0.2 \u00c5). The interface morphology is found to\nstay the same when varying the Au thickness. The in-\nterface width deduced from the specular scatter equaled\nthe roughness determined from the diffuse scatter, showing\nthat interdiffusion was negligible. Therefore, these struc-\ntural properties imply that the (111) system should have\nthe higher conductivity, contrary to the observations.\nThe values of sFe, determined from the intercept in\nFig. 1, are very similar in the (111) and (100) materials.\nGIXD measurements indicate that the (100) Fe is in good\ncrystallographic registration with the (100) Au as expected\nfrom the lattice matching. In situ RHEED data [28] and\nex situ medium energy ion scattering [29] experiments\nfrom multilayers grown on sapphire showed that the\ngrowth of Fe (111) on Au(111) is pseudomorphic for Fe\nthicknesses less than 10 \u00c5 in agreement with previous\nresults [30]. The (111) Fe\u0001Au system eventually relaxes\ninto its bulk structure, but only after the Fe thickness\nbecomes greater than 15 \u00c5. For all samples in this study,\ntherefore, both orientations grow epitaxially.\nThe structural studies show that neither the variation of\nthe saturation conductivity as a function of Au layer thick-\nness nor the difference between (100) and (111) oriented\nmultilayers can be attributed simply to the difference in\nsample quality. We thus conclude that the data in Fig. 1\ndemonstrate the existence of electron channeling in Fe\u0001Au\n(100) multilayers.\nWe thank M. Horlacher for coding the Hood and Falicov\nmodel, J.
