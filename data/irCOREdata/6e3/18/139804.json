Introduction  \nGenerally, there is a great demand for new high explosives (HEs) which are suitable \nfor use in insensitive munitions (IMs).  The necessity to know and understand the properties \nof such energetic materials is driven by the need to improve performance and enhance \nstability to various stimuli, such as thermal, friction and impact insult. \nPyrazine derivatives are six-membered heterocyclic compounds containing two \nnitrogen atoms in the ring system.  As high-nitrogen heterocylic compounds, they have an \nideal structure as energetic materials (EMs).  Some of them have high formation enthalpy, \nfine thermal stability and good safety characteristics [1-11].  The basic structure of energetic \npyrazine compounds is that of 3,5-dinitro-2,6-diaminopyrazine (I in Fig. 1).  One of the most \nprominent members in this family, however, is the 1-oxide 3,5-dinitro-2,6-pyrazinediamine 1-\noxide (II, also known as LLM-105 [1-3]).  (N.B.  The second N-oxide isomer of compound II \nhas so far not been reported since experimentally oxidation of I always yields isomer II.  For \nthis reason we have not included the second isomer of II into our theoretical study). \n \nN\nN NH2NH2\nNO2NO2 N\nN NH2NH2\nNO2NO2\nO\nN\nN NH2NH2\nNO2NO2\nO\nO\n  I        II              III \n \nFig. 1    Molecular structures of compounds I, II and III    \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 3\nN\nN\nCl Cl N\nN\nRO OR N\nN\nRO OR\nO2N NO2RONa\/ROH\n83\u00b0C, 23h\nHNO3\/H2SO4\nR = Me, Et, Pr\nN\nNO2N\nRO\nNO2\nOR\nNH3\nN\nNO2N\nH2N\nNO2\nNH2\nR = Me, Et, Pr\n-ROH\nLLM-105 has a high density of 1.92 g cm-3, it also shows a detonation velocity of \n8730 m s-1 and a detonation pressure of 359 kbar which are comparable to those of RDX \n(density = 1.80 g cm-3, exptl. values: VoD = 8750 , PC-J = 347 kbar).  LLM-105 is much less \nimpact sensitive than RDX and is not sensitive towards electrostatics and friction [1-3, 8-11].   \nThere are various methods to prepare compound II, most start from commercially available \n2,6-dichloropyrazine (Scheme 1) and oxidize I in the final step to the 1- oxide II [1-3, 8-11]. \n \n                I                II \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   I  \nScheme 1. Synthesis of I and II starting from 2,6-dichloropyrazine \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 4\nThe greatly enhanced detonation performance of II compared to I whilst remaining \nlow in sensitivity prompted us to investigate theoretically their thermochemistry and to \ncalculate the detonation parameters of the experimentally hitherto unknown dioxide III.  A \nreport of this study is given below. \n \n2. Methods \n \nAll calculations (structures, energies, ESPs and NMR chemical shifts [12, 15-18]) \nwere carried out using the Gaussian G03W (revision B.03) program package [12]. \nThe enthalpies (H) and free energies (G) were calculated using the complete basis set \n(CBS) method of Petersson and coworkers in order to obtain very accurate energies.  The \nCBS models use the known asymptotic convergence of pair natural orbital expressions to \nextrapolate from calculations using a finite basis set to the estimated complete basis set limit.  \nCBS-4 begins with a HF\/3-21G(d) structure optimization; the zero point energy is computed \nat the same level.  It then uses a large basis set SCF calculation as a base energy, and a \nMP2\/6-31+G calculation with a CBS extrapolation to correct the energy through second \norder.  A MP4(SDQ)\/6-31+(d,p) calculation is used to approximate higher order \ncontributions.  In this study we applied the modified CBS-4M method (M referring to the use \nof Minimal Population localization) which is a re-parametrized version of the original CBS-4 \nmethod and also includes some additional empirical corrections [13, 14].  \n \n3. Results and discussion      \n                    \nThe molecular structures of compound I, II and III were fully optimized without \nsymmetry constraints at HF\/6-31G* level of theory to C2v, C2v and Cs symmetry, respectively \n(Fig. 2). \n \nFig. 2    Optimized molecular structures of compounds I (left), II (center) and III (right). \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 5\n \n  \nThe enthalpies of formation of the gas-phase species M were computed according to \nthe atomization energy method (eq. 1) (Tab. 1-3) [19-21].  In eq. (1) \u2206fH\u00b0(g,M) stands for the \ngas-phase enthalpy of formation of the molecule M under investigation, H(M) represents the \nCBS-4M calculated enthalpy of the molecule M (H298 in Tab. 1), atomsH\u00b0 denotes the CBS-4M \ncalculated enthalpies for the individual atoms (see bottom of Tab. 1) and \u2206atoms,fH\u00b0 stands for \nthe experimentally reported literature values for the enthalpies of formation for the \ncorresponding atoms (\u2206H\u00b0f298 in Tab. 2.). The excellent agreement between the reported \nexperimental enthalpies of formation for compounds I and II with the CBS-4M calculated \nvalues (Tab. 5) gives credence that also the computed values for compounds III are quite \naccurate. \n \n                                      (1) \n \n \nTab. 1          CBS-4M results \n \ncompound p.g a. el.state b -H298\/a.u. c -G298\/a.u. d NIMAG e \u03bd1\/cm-1 \n       \nI C2v 1A 783.095183 783.144886 0 58 \nII C2v 1A 858.170507 858.221962 0 65 \nIII Cs 1A 933.217451 933.271921 0 38 \n \na  point group,  b electronic state,  c CBS-4M calculated enthalpy,  d CBS-4M calculated free \nenergy,  e NIMAG number of imaginary frequencies. \n \n \nTab. 2          Literature values for atomic enthalpies of formation \u2206H\u00b0f298 \/ kcal mol-1 \n   \n Ref [19] NIST [22] \n   \nH 52.6 52.1 \nC 170.2 171.3 \nN 113.5 113.0 \nO 60.0 59.6 \n \n \n\u2206fH0(g, M) = H(M) \u2013 \u03a3H0 + \u03a3\u2206fH0  atoms atoms \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 6\nTab. 3          Enthalpies of formation of the gas-phase compounds M \ncompound \u2206fH\u00b0(g,M) \/ kcal mol-1 \n  \nI 23.5 \nII 30.3 \nIII 54.9 \n \n \nThe enthalpies of sublimation for compounds I, II and III were estimated according to \nTrouton\u2019s rule (eq.2, Tab.4) [23] with melting points of 363\u00b0C[24], 302\u00b0C[24] for compounds \nI and II, respectively and estimated melting point of 250\u00b0C for compound III (based on the \nfact that the m.p. of II is 60\u00b0C lower than the m.p. of I and the assumption that III will have \nagain a 60\u00b0C lower m.p. than II).

The program is based on the chemical equilibrium, steady-state \nmodel of detonation. It uses the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson\u2019s equation of state (BKW EOS) \nfor gaseous detonation products and Cowan-Fickett\u2019s equation of state for solid carbon [27-\n29].

Figure 4 shows the electrostatic \npotentials for the 0.001 electron\/bohr3 isosurfaces of electron density evaluated at the B3LYP \nlevel of theory.  The colors range from \u20130.06 to +0.06 hartrees with dark blue denoting \nextremely electron-deficient regions (V(r) > 0.06 hartree) and red denoting electron-rich \nregions (V(r) < -0.06 hartrees).  It has recently been found by Politzer, Murray et al. [31] and \nextensively used by Rice et al. [32] that the patterns of the computed electrostatic potential on \nthe surface of molecules in general can be related to the sensitivity of the bulk material.  The \nelectrostatic potential at any point r is given by eq. (5) in which ZA is the charge on nucleus A, \nlocated at RA.  Politzer et al. were able to show [31] that impact sensitivity can be expressed \nas a function of the extend of this anomalous reversal of the strengths of the positive and \nnegative surface potentials. \n                                  \n                                             (5) \n                                                          \n         It is known that the delocalization of \u03c0 electrons over an aromatic ring is effected by \nboth electron-withdrawing and \u2013donating substituents attached to the ring. In their study \nMurray et al. [31] found that for the nitroaromatics, the ESP on the surface above the aromatic \nring was positive reflecting the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro groups. In addition to \nthat, the same authors also found that electron-donating groups such as NH2 or OCH3 partially \ncounteract the electron withdrawing effects of the nitro groups. The calculated electrostatic \npotential of compound I (see Fig. 4) reproduces these findings. The electron-withdrawing \npotential of the two nitro groups seems to be perfectly balanced by the electron-donating \nability of the two amino groups. A similar behavior has already been observed for TATB \n(1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene) [33]. The compounds under investigation in this study \n(II and III) differ from compound I only in one or two electron-withdrawing N-oxide \nsubstituents attached to the aromatic ring system. As it appears in Fig. 4, attaching one or two \nN-oxide oxygen atoms to the aromatic ring (compounds II and III) makes the regions of \npositive potential over the ring considerable stronger than the negative ones. This atypical \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 11\nimbalance between stronger positive regions and weaker negative ones can be related to the \nimpact sensitivities. From this finding, the better performing (see above) compound III would \nbe expected to also show somewhat higher sensitivity towards impact stimulus than \ncompound II (LLM-105).  Only experimental studies will be able to quantitatively establish \nthe exact sensitivities of III.  Such studies are underway in our laboratories.   \n \n  \n                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4   Electrostatic potentials of compounds I (left), II (right) and III (bottom)  \n            (B3LYP\/6-31G(d), 0.001e bohr -3 isosurface, energy  values -0.06 H to +0.06 H );  \n            color coding: red (very negative), orange (negative), yellow (slightly negative), green \n            (neutral), turquoise (slightly positive), light blue (positive), dark blue (very positive)    \n              \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 12\nIn order to calculate the NMR chemical shifts for 15N, the isotropic magnetic \nshieldings were computed using the GIAO (Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital) method \nimplemented in G03 [12,15-18].
