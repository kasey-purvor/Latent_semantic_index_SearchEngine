Introduction \n \nManufacture of advanced composites involves processes of different physical nature, \nincluding forming, consolidation or impregnation, and curing in the case of thermosetting \nmatrices. The outcome of each process influences the rest of the manufacturing stages, and \nfeeds through to the design of the composite component, creating complex interdependencies \nbetween manufacturing parameters, design constraints and properties of the final part.  \nModelling of draping and forming of woven material is an essential step in process design and \noptimisation involving such materials. Research on forming of woven textiles can be \nclassified into two general categories; kinematic models and continuum mechanics-based \nmodels.  Kinematic models [1-4] are geometrical mapping algorithms that are well developed \nand implemented in commercial software packages. They treat the woven material as a pin-\njointed net of inextensible fibres, without including the effect of material properties. Effects \nsuch as non-linear shear response, decrimping, wrinkling and slip between tows are ignored. \nAs a result, kinematic models are computationally very efficient but they are only sensitive to \nthe geometry of the manufacturing tool and the initial path of draping. Continuum mechanics \napproaches usually employ finite element (FE) formulations to solve the forming problem, in \nwhich the woven material is modelled as a thin sheet [5-8]. Successful implementation \nrequires the development of appropriate material models that take into consideration \nmechanical effects relevant to forming. The non-linear character of this type of analysis \nresults in very long solution times which can limit its applicability within a process \ndesign\/optimisation context where iterative execution of the model is required.   \nA new class of forming models that constitute truss-based simplifications of continuum \nmodels has been proposed recently [9-11]. These models involve modelling of tows of the \nwoven material by using an assembly of pin-jointed elastic bar elements. The shear behaviour \nof the sheet of material is incorporated in these models either by overlaying a set of shell \nelements on the assembly of bars [9, 10] or by connecting the diagonal nodes of the truss with \nbar elements that have appropriate non-linear stiffness [11].  Truss-based models allow \nefficient analysis that incorporates the mechanics of the material, thus offering the potential \nfor use within a process design\/optimisation.  \nModelling of the viscous behaviour of pre-impregnated woven textiles is an integral part of \nmechanics-based forming models. Phenomenological continuum models which take into \naccount the viscous or viscoplastic response of the woven textile have been developed [12-\n14]. The material in these models is considered to behave as an anisotropic, incompressible \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nviscous fluid or viscoplastic solid, which is inextensible in the tow directions. As this is a \npurely phenomenological approach, picture frame or bias extension tests are required to \nestimate of material parameters. Predictive approaches based on analysing the mechanics of \nwoven textiles at a unit cell level have also been proposed [15, 16]. The analysis of the unit \ncell can be performed using finite element modelling [15], in which case computationally \nintensive mesh generation and model solution steps are necessary, or using analytical models \n[16] that constitute computationally efficient approximations based on the constituent \nproperties and information on the kinematics of deformation. The aforementioned models and \ntheir implementations focus on modelling successfully the loading shear behaviour of woven \ntextiles. However, during manufacturing, deformation is not necessarily monotonic. For \nexample, in the case of an uneven double dome geometry, part of the woven material that is \ndraped over the lower dome shears in opposite directions before and after contact with \ndifferent portions of the tool. This situation arises because when the woven sheet first comes \nin contact with the higher dome, material in the bias direction shears so that bias strain is \npositive in the radial direction with respect to the higher dome.  When part of this material \ncomes in contact with the lower dome shear occurs in the bias direction so that bias strain is \npositive in the radial direction of the second dome. As the radial directions with respect to the \ntwo domes do not always coincide, some of the material undergoes a shear loading\/unloading \npath.   \nThe work presented in this paper builds upon the draping simulation methodology based on \nthe truss representation of woven materials. The truss-based model proposed in [11] is \nextended to include:  \ni. Strain rate dependence in the response of elements of the model controlling shear \nresponse \nii. Non-linear response of tows due to decrimping effects \niii. Wrinkling due to buckling of groups of tows \nThe model requires the phenomenological constitutive relationships which incorporate the \nelastic-viscoplastic shear response and the decrimping of tows. Analysis of the mechanics of a \nunit cell leads to an efficient inversion procedure for the estimation of  the parameters of the \nelastic-viscoplastic and of the non-linear elastic material constitutive relationships from bias \nextension and tensile tests.  \nResearch on manufacturing faults during forming has focused so far on wrinkling caused by \nexcessive shear after tows lock up [17]. In this case, out-of-plane deformation is caused by \ncompression in directions transverse to tows. The model developed in this study accounts for \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \na different mode of wrinkling that is manifested as buckling of one set of tows and is \nobserved when compression in the tow directions occurs while the material remains \nunsheared. This type of wrinkling influences the mechanical response of the produced \ncomponent significantly, as elastic properties in the direction of buckled tows are governed by \ntheir bending stiffness instead of fibre modulus. The methodology used to model this type of \nwrinkling is based on concepts developed for the modelling of membrane wrinkling [18] and \ninvolves an element deactivation\/activation strategy. The model formulation is appropriate for \nimplementation in commercial finite element codes, thus exploiting their capabilities in \nmodelling complex geometries and boundary conditions. Hemisphere forming is used to \ndemonstrate and validate the performance of the model and the sensitivity of the process \noutcome to forming speed and blank holder force is investigated.   \n  \n2. Model description \n \n2.1. Truss model \nThe simplified forming model simulates the woven fabric as an assembly of bars, as shown in \nFig. 1. All bars are connected at the corners of the unit cell via pin joints. The sides of the unit \ncell represent the tows of the textile and the diagonal bars govern the non-linear shear \nbehaviour of the assembly. This arrangement allows the trellising action observed in practice \nto be reproduced when the effective stiffness of the tow bars is significantly higher than the \nshear resistance of diagonal bars. Under shear, one of the diagonal elements is in tension and \nthe other in compression.  \nTow \nelement\nShear \nelement\n\u2206\nBlank holder\nboundary\nFriction \nelement\n(a) (b)  \nFig. 1. Simplified forming model. (a) Truss assembly. (b) Undeformed unit cell. \n The incorporation of wrinkling due to tow buckling is based on an activation\/deactivation \nstrategy applied to tow elements. Deactivation is triggered by the existence of compressive \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nstrain in the element and reactivation by the existence of tensile strain. This simple approach \nis attractive due to the ease with which it can be implemented across a range of analysis \nplatforms, and is justified by the effective way in which it models wrinkling, as shown in \nsection 4. More sophisticated models which can derive the wrinkled configuration are \navailable in explicit FE codes, but the emphasis of this work is on relatively fast algorithms \nwhich can be implemented in an optimisation routine. As noted in the introduction, wrinkling \ndue either to excessive shear or compressive stresses can arise. Here we consider the mode \nassociated with compressive stresses, as these have a more significant bearing on mechanical \nperformance (affecting properties in the tow directions). It is expected that wrinkling \nassociated with shear can be simply correlated with the maximum shear angle.  The action of \nthe blank holder on the woven material is incorporated in a simplified but pragmatic way in \nthe model by the inclusion of a group of bar elements connected to nodes in contact with the \nblank holder. These elements, which are fixed with respect to all degrees of freedom on their \nfree ends, simulate friction via their perfectly plastic behaviour. Their yield stress is  \n \nsf\ntot\ny nA\n\u00b5F\n\u03c3 =                                                                                                     (1) \nwhere totF  is the total clamping force, \u00b5  is the textile-tool friction coefficient, fA  is the  \ncross-sectional area of the element, and sn  is the total number of friction elements, which \nequals the number of nodes in contact with the blank holder. Although this model does not \nexactly reproduce the usual assumption, that the friction force acts parallel to the direction of \nthe slip velocity (instead acting along the direction of the total displacement of a node), it is \nfelt to be adequate in this application. \nThe material behaviour of tow and diagonal shear elements follows directly from \nexperimental observations and the operational requirements of the simplified model. Tow \nelements govern the tensile behaviour of the material in the tow direction, which typically \nfollows a bilinear stress-strain curve, with the initial part corresponding to changes in \nundulation and tow compression and the second part following the elastic behaviour of the \ntow [19, 20]. A simple elastic model is adopted in this approach, neglecting for example \ncoupling between warp and weft tow strains seen in textiles modelling, though in principle \nthis could be incorporated. A non-linear elastic constitutive relationship is used to express this \nbehaviour, \n( )tt \u03b5G\u03c3 =                                                                                                       (2) \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nHere t\u03c3  and t\u03b5  denote the tow element stress and Green-Lagrange strain respectively, and G  \nis   \n( ) ( ) \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n++= \u03b5\u03b1\no\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b1\no\ntt e\nln\n\u03b1\nEE\ne\nln\n\u03b1\nEE\n\u03b5E\u03b5G\nt 1\n1--\n1\n1- \u221e\n--\n\u221e\n\u221e                  (3) \nThis expression results in linear elastic behaviour with effective modulus oE  at very low \nstrains and linear elastic behaviour with effective modulus \u221eE  at high strains. The transition \nfrom the low modulus region to the high modulus region occurs at a transition strain \u03b5  and \nhas breadth proportional to a1 .

It can be represented as shown in Fig. 2(a). It comprises a Maxwell \nelement with a non-linear dashpot with strain dependent viscosity \u03b7 , connected in parallel \nwith an elastic-plastic element of constant yield stress o\u03c3  and allows for viscous behaviour in \nboth the elastic and plastic phases of deformation. \nEp\n\u03c3o\nEv\nn(\u03b5v)\n\u03c3\n\u03b5v\n\u03c3\n\u03b5ved\n\u03b5vpd\nd\nd\n(a) (b)\n\u03b5 -\u03b5vdd\nTime\nSt\nre\nss\n, S\ntr\nai\nn\nStress Strain\nSt\nre\nss\n, S\ntr\nai\nn\n \nFig. 2. Constitutive model of the shear diagonal element. (a) Schematic representation. (b) \nResponse in loading-relaxation-reloading-unloading. \nThe dependence of viscosity on strain is selected so that it reproduces experimental \nobservations of the shear behaviour of woven textile composites. A sequence of three \nmechanisms occurs as shear strain increases: (i) flexural deformation of tows; (ii) friction \ncontrolled tow rotation at crossover regions and; (iii) lateral compression of the tows [21, 22]. \nIt follows that the material is more compliant at low strains when bearing-type contact effects \ndominate deformation, whereas shear resistance increases rapidly at higher strains due to \nlateral compression and intra-tow friction which eventually cause lock up of the textile \nstructure. The strain is decomposed into viscoelastic and viscoplastic contributions as \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nve\nd\nvp\ndd \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 +=                        (5) \nThe material behaves as a viscoelastic solid when the viscoelastic strain is below the yielding \nstrain or when the stress and strain rate have opposite signs, i.e. poved E\u03c3\u03b5 <  or 0\u2264d\u03b5\u03c3 & .

In this region, the slope of the bilinear curve is oo s\u03b7  at low absolute \nviscous strains and \u221es\u03b7o  at high absolute viscous strains. Transition from one behaviour to the \nother occurs at absolute viscous strain v\u03b5  with a breadth proportional to va1 . In unloading, i.e. \nwhen strain rate and viscous strain have opposite signs, the viscosity has a constant value. A \nschematic of the typical behaviour produced by the shear element constitutive model in a \nloading-relaxation-reloading-unloading strain profile is shown in Fig. 2(b). The stress initially \nincreases following the behaviour of a typical bias extension curve. During relaxation, it \ndecays towards a low value. On reloading the stress increases rapidly and then follows the \nbias extension behaviour at high strains, whereas during unloading it decreases rapidly until it \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nreaches the yield stress in compression. Then the material flows until strain becomes positive \nand the material starts to resist shear in the opposite direction.  \nIt should be noted that the superposition assumption implied in Eqs. (5) and (9) is not \nstrictly valid in large displacement analysis. A Green-Lagrange strain formulation is used in \nthe model developed here. In this case the relative discrepancy when the deformation is \ndistributed with weights w  and w\u22121  between the two strain components is given by the \nrelationship        \n( )\ntot\ntottot\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\u03b5\nwwD\n212-22\n-1\n++=                              (10) \nwhere tot\u03b5  is the total strain and the weight w  ranges from 0 to 1. The theoretical maximum of \nrelative discrepancy occurs for maximum total strain and equal weights. The kinematics of the \nunit cell limits the Green-Lagrange strain of the diagonals to 0.5, which corresponds to a \nrelative error of 8%. In practice, this error is lower because lock up of woven material limits \nthe deformation to diagonal strains below 0.4. Furthermore, the part of the deformation driven \nby friction dominates the shear of woven material. This results in most of the deformation \noccurring as plastic strain. Similarly, for realistic process speeds the resistance of the viscous \nelement is significantly lower than that of the elastic part of the Maxwell branch of the elastic-\nviscoplastic model. Consequently, the weight attributed to plastic and viscous deformation is \nexpected to be higher than 50% and the relative discrepancy significantly smaller than 8%.      \n \n2.2.

(5) to (9). Given the forces acting on the nodes, 6 element stresses and 4 element vectors \nthat correspond to a total of 18 unknown variables characterise the state of stress. The number \nof available algebraic equations in the general case is also 18, 9 by the force balance, 3 by the \ncompatibility condition and 6 by the constitutive relationships.  \nThe solution of an equivalent system of equations is performed by the implicit finite element \ncode used in the current implementation of the model (MSC.Marc). For the simple \nmechanical models used here, an explicit formation is not needed, considerably speeding up \nthe solution time. However, it is useful to derive solutions in the cases of loading under \ntension and bias extension as these represent experimental conditions commonly used for \nobtaining material properties of woven textiles. Parameter identification for material sub-\nmodels can then be performed efficiently using these rather than relying on  finite element \nsolutions. The two loading situations are depicted in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c). The symmetry of \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \ntensile loading results in equal force and strain in the two shear elements and equal responses \nof opposite tow elements of the unit cell.

The \ntypical bilinear behaviour caused by decrimping effects is observed in tension. Bias extension \nresults show an initial force increase at low strains, followed by a low stiffness region and a \nlarge increase in stiffness at high strain. This behaviour is caused by the successive \ndominance of tow bending, friction at tow crossovers and lateral tow compression, as strain \nincreases. Strong strain rate dependence of the response in bias extension is observed. \nApparent shear compliance decreases with increasing rate, whereas the strain at which a \ntransition from low to high shear stiffness behaviour increases. These observations are \nconsistent with the viscous behaviour of a thermosetting matrix. Measured force was \nnormalised by the number of tows of the corresponding specimen (17.8 tows in the tensile test \nand 35.3 in the bias extension test). Eqs. (15) to (17) were used to simulate tension and Eqs. \n(18) to (20) bias extension in an incremental scheme. Non-linear equations such as Eqs. (16)  \nand (19) were solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Inversion of the model response in \norder to estimate the parameters of the constitutive relationships was performed using the \nGeneralised Reduced Gradient Nonlinear Optimisation method implemented in Microsoft \nExcel [25]. The objective of inversion was the minimisation of the average absolute \ndifference of force predicted by the model and measured during the experiments. The non-\nlinear character of the problem may create difficulties in the fitting procedure due to the \nexistence of numerous local minima that induce a strong dependence of the solution on the \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \ninitial guess.

Similarly, \ninitial guesses for v\u03b1   and v\u03b5   can be obtained by the transition strain and the breadth of \ntransition of the low strain rate bias extension curve. The two moduli of the elastic-\nviscoplastic model ( pE  and vE  ) are pre-estimated by the initial slope of the bias extension \ncurves. The limit moduli of the tow elements sub-model ( oE  and \u221eE  ) can be inferred with \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nhigh accuracy using the initial and final slopes of the tensile curve. Similarly, initial guesses \nfor the breadth parameter and the strain at the transition from low to high modulus ( \u03b1  and \u03b5  ) \nare obtained from the tensile test results.  \nTable 2 \nParameters of the constitutive models and model fitting error and sensitivity of \nresponse and error to model parameters \nParameter Value Tensile error \nsensitivity \nBias extension \nerror sensitivity \nTensile force \nsensitivity \nBias extension force \nsensitivity \no\u03c3  2.62 10\n-2 N\/tow 0.0 6.3 10-1 0.0 2.9 10-1 \no\u03b7  1.37 N\/tow 1.1 10\n-5 2.8 1.2 10-5 5.5 10-1 \nos  7.48 -1.0 10\n-8 6.4 10-1 4.4 10-8 1.6 10-1 \n\u221es  5.39 10\n3 -4.5 10-10 1.8 1.9 10-9 2.5 10-1 \nv\u03b1  1.90 10\n1 3.9 10-9 5.0 -1.6 10-8 -1.1 \nv\u03b5  5.12 10\n-1 3.9 10-9 1.1 101 -1.6 10-8 -2.2 \nvE  7.89 N\/tow 2.1 10\n-9 9.6 10-1 1.5 10-7 1.2 10-1 \npE  3.90 10\n-1 N\/tow -4.0 10-6 1.3 10-1 2.3 10-5 2.7 10-2 \noE  3.41 10\n3 N\/tow 1.2  -3.8 10-3 5.1 10-1 7.3 10-4 \n\u221eE  2.91 10\n4 N\/tow 1.1 -3.2 10-10 4.8 10-1 4.3 10-11 \n\u03b5  1.44 10\n-3 2.9 101 4.3 10-9 -1.8 -5.8 10-10 \n\u03b1  1.33 10\n4 5.3 10-3 4.1 10-9 -3.5 10-2 -5.7 10-10 \nThe results of model fitting are summarised in Table 2. The average error is 7.1 N in tensile \nforce estimation and 0.6 N in bias extension. The corresponding relative errors are in the \nrange of 7-9%. The quality of the fit is illustrated in Fig. 6. The tensile curve is followed by \nthe model. The general form of the bias extension simulation results matches the experiments \nsuccessfully and strain rate dependence and the transition from tow crossover friction to tow \ncompression are followed closely. The sensitivity of the model fit and of its response to the \nestimated parameters was investigated by calculating sensitivity coefficients of the fitting \nerror and the average force over all experiments. To calculate the sensitivity coefficients, each \nindependent parameter was increased by 2.5% and the percentage variation in the model \nresponse and fitting error was calculated and divided by the percentage change in the \nparameter. Investigation of sensitivity at higher variation levels indicated that the linearity \nassumption underlying this analysis is valid for changes up to 5%. The results are summarised \nin Table 2. It is found that the tensile error and response are sensitive only to the parameters \nof the tow element material sub-model. Similarly the bias extension error and response are \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nsensitive only to the parameters of the shear element material sub-model. Consequently, the \nparameter estimation problem can be solved separately for the two sub-models and \nexperiments. However, the general formulation used here may be necessary in other woven \nmaterials, e.g. when decrimping modulus or fibre modulus is low. The bias extension fitting \nerror shows high sensitivity to the viscous transition strain, the amplitude of viscosity and the \nbreadth parameter of the viscosity transition. The tension fitting error is most sensitive to the \ntransition strain. The model response is very sensitive to both transition strain and the \nviscosity amplitude. The two moduli of the elastic-viscoplastic model have low influence on \nboth the error and the model response because the experimental data do not include results of \nrelaxation or unloading tests that would manifest high sensitivities to these parameters.     \n \n4. Modelling of hemisphere forming and validation \n \nThe simplified forming model described in the previous sections was implemented in \nMSC.Marc to model the forming of a hemisphere, which was also investigated experimentally \nfor validation purposes. The truss was simulated using an assembly of two-node bar elements. \nAppropriate user defined subroutines were developed for the incorporation of the viscoplastic \nstress-strain response of shear elements, of wrinkling and non-linear elastic behaviour of tow \nelements and of the perfectly plastic behaviour of friction elements.  Material properties \nproduced by experimental analysis and parameter identification are normalised with respect to \nthe number of tows. Consequently, properties of the elements of the unit cell need to be scaled \nby multiplying by et A\/n , where tn  is the number of warp\/weft tows and eA  the cross-\nsectional area of the bar element. Tooling was modelled as a group of rigid surfaces and \ncontact between the woven material and tooling was included. The symmetry of the \nhemisphere combined with the bi-directional properties of the material allows simulations to \nbe based on a one quarter model. \n \n4.1. Hemisphere forming experiments \nHemisphere forming experiments were carried out using a stamp forming process with two \nmatched tools set on a hydraulic press. Draw-in of the pre-preg was controlled using a blank-\nholder comprising two square clamping plates with central circular openings. The nominal \nradius of the hemispherical part of the tool was 60 mm, while the hemisphere was connected \nwith the tool base via a fillet of 20 mm in radius. The diameter of the openings of the \nclamping plates was 170 mm, allowing movement of one of the hemispherical tools. The \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nforce acting on the clamping plates was controlled using four springs which were set at \nappropriate compression by tightening a bolt. Pre-impregnated woven material was placed on \nthe blank-holder which was then mounted in place. Release agent was applied to all tool \nsurfaces prior to the placement of the material to allow easy demoulding after curing. \nExperiments were conducted using the 4\u00d74 twill weave 3k carbon\/1947 epoxy prepreg \n(Hexcel) used in material characterisation. The size of the sheet of pre-impregnated sheet was \n240\u00d7240 mm. Prior to experiments white lines were drawn on the woven material following \nthe direction of tows to form a grid, 10mm in size. Forming was performed at room \ntemperature using a total holding force of 133 N, which included contributions from the four \nsprings and the weight of the top clamping plate.  The travelling distance of the movable tool \nwas 80 mm, the forming speed was approximately 2 mm\/s and the duration of forming 40 s. \nAfter completion of forming, the assembly was heated up to 120 oC and was kept at that \ntemperature for an hour to cure the epoxy resin. The final glass transition temperature of the \ncured material is 143 oC.   \n \nFig. 7. Forming of a 4\u00d74 twill weave 3k carbon\/1947 hemisphere. (a)  Formed specimen. (b) \nDetail of the occurrence of wrinkling in region 1 in the internal surface of the specimen. (c) \nDetail of the occurrence of wrinkling in region 1  in the external surface of the specimen. The \nspacing of the grid is 10 mm. \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nFig. 7 shows the cured specimen obtained in the experiment. It can be observed that high \nshear occurs at diagonal positions along the bias direction of the woven material while the \nmaterial on the apex of the hemisphere is undeformed. Wrinkling due to tow buckling occurs \nat four positions along the direction of the two sets of tows in the area of the fillet.  The \ndirection of buckling is parallel to the sides of the specimen. Excessive compression can \nresult in folding of the material as it can be seen in Fig. 7(c).  \nThe overall shape of the formed specimen is slightly asymmetric. The way wrinkling strain is \ndistributed in the areas of concentrated tow buckling and is also asymmetric. In the region \nshown in Fig. 7(c) and its diametrically opposite side, wrinkling results in folding. In contrast, \nwrinkling at the other two areas of concentrated buckling is distributed over an area covering \na few squares of the grid. The observed asymmetry can be attributed to initial variations in the \nangle between tows and variations in the application of holding force from the blank holder. \nThe positions of the nodes of the grid, shown as dots on the formed specimen in Fig. 7, were \nmeasured using an Omicron 3-D coordinate measurement system. The specimen was set on a \ntable, the measuring head of the device was moved to each of the nodes and its position in \nspace was recorded.  In order to remove the effects of asymmetry and provide a reliable set of \ndeformation measurements for comparison with the forming model, an average of the grid \npositions on the four quarters of the hemisphere was calculated. The point cloud was post \nprocessed to calculate the  \nstrains and shear angle of the unit cells of the grid. \n \n4.2. Model convergence and validation \nThe spatial convergence of the model was investigated by simulating hemisphere forming \nusing meshes of different sizes. One quarter of the 240\u00d7240 mm sheet of woven material was \nrepresented using unit cell sizes in the range from 60 to 8.6 mm, resulting in models with \nnumber of nodes ranging from 9 to 225. Solution times using MSC.Marc on a Pentium 4 2.8 \nGHz PC were in the order of 5 s for the 9 node model and in the order of 60 s for the 225 \nnode model. These times are significantly shorter than solution times for shell based \ncomprehensive finite element simulations of forming, which are expected to be in the order of \nhours, and significantly longer than execution times for kinematic models, which are in the \norder of seconds.  The total clamping force for these model runs was 133 N.  \nFig. 8 illustrates the draped pattern predicted by the model at various unit cell sizes. The \ngeometry of the tool surface is followed closely for unit cell sizes smaller than 15 mm (81 \nnodes in the finite element representation of a quarter of the woven sheet) which corresponds \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nto a quarter of the hemisphere radius. The geometric fit is poor for mesh densities lower than \nthis. The theoretical formed pattern shows maximum shear at diagonal positions aligned to the \nbias direction of the woven textile, which is qualitatively similar to the pattern seen in the \nexperimental observations. The dotted lines in Fig. 8 indicate regions where significant \nwrinkling is evident. This occurs at normal positions aligned to the direction of warp and weft \ntows on the base of the hemisphere, whereas compression due to wrinkling follows the \ndirection of the corresponding side of the woven material sheet.    \n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n(e) (f)\n \nFig. 8.

The dotted circles indicate \nregions of concentrated buckling. \nFig. 9 illustrates the dependence of maximum shear angle, total wrinkling strain and average \nerror in total node displacement as a function of the number of nodes of the forming model. \nTotal wrinkling strain was calculated by summing up wrinkling deformation over all elements \nwith negative strains and dividing this by the total length of tow elements of the model. \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \n-0.6%\n-0.3%\n0.0%\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nNumber of nodes\nTo\nta\nl w\nrin\nkl\nin\ng \nst\nra\nin\n25.0\n35.0\n45.0\n55.0\nM\nax\nim\num\n s\nhe\nar\n (\no\n)\nTotal wrinkling strain\nMaximum shear\n0.0\n3.0\n6.0\n9.0\n12.0\nA\nve\nra\nge\n e\nrr\nor\n (m\nm\n)\nAverage distance\n \nFig. 9. Dependence of total wrinkling strain, maximum shear and average nodal distance \nfrom the results of the finest model on the total number of nodes of the quarter model. \n The average error in total displacement was estimated as the difference between the predicted \nfinal nodal position for each model and the corresponding position predicted by the finest \nmodel, taking an average over 169 points of a 13\u00d713 square grid on the sheet of the woven \nmaterial . The error drops steeply and becomes negligible with models having over 100 nodes \nor for unit cell sizes lower than 12 mm. At a 10 mm unit cell size, the average error in \ndisplacement becomes approximately 0.25 mm, or 2.5% of the unit cell size. The estimated \nmaximum shear angle increases with increasing number of nodes as a result of the improved \ngeometric fit with decreasing unit cell size. The value reaches a plateau beyond 100 nodes. \nTotal wrinkling strain shows sensitivity to the mesh size up to 169 nodes or 10 mm unit cell \nsize. Initially, predicted total wrinkling strain drops as the unit cell size decreases. For unit \ncell sizes below 10 mm the prediction for total wrinkling strain stabilises to a value of about \n0.55%. Overall, model predictions show stability with respect to mesh refinement. Nodal \ndisplacement and shear values converge for unit cell sizes below 12 mm, whereas a unit cell \nsize of 10 mm is required to reach a stable value of total wrinkling strain.  Consequently, a \nunit cell of 10 mm is appropriate for modelling of the hemisphere geometry. It should be \nnoted that this value is one sixth of the hemisphere radius and half the radius of the base fillet. \nConvergence of the model for relatively coarse meshes such as those represented in Figs 9(e) \nand 9(f) originates in the simplified representation of wrinkling effects and is one of the \nreasons for its computational efficiency.  \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nWrinkling strainUnit cell angle o\nWrinkling strainUnit cell angle o\n \nFig. 10.

Model \nresults for the shear distributions follow experimental results very closely, with high shear at \nfour locations aligned to the bias direction and negligible shear on the apex. The shape of the \nformed sheet predicted by the model is very close to that observed in experimental forming, \nwith the only difference being a slightly higher extension in the diagonal direction. The model \nlocates correctly regions of concentrated wrinkling due to tow buckling at four normal \npositions aligned to the tow directions along the base of the hemisphere. The maximum shear \nmeasured in the experiment is 50.2o, whereas the corresponding model value is 51.4 o. The \nminimum value of Green-Lagrange wrinkling strain is 0.31 and 0.21 in the experiment and \nthe model predictions, respectively. The average forming prediction error, calculated as the \naverage distance between the final positions of points of the square grid measured and \npredicted by the model, is 1.57 mm, which is about 4% of the average distance between final \nand initial positions of the nodes of the grid. \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nWrinkling pathShear path\n(a) (b)\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0 50 100\nDistance on path (mm)\nW\nrin\nkl\nin\ng \nst\nra\nin\n \nExperiment\nFE model\nPJN model\n0.0\n30.0\n60.0\n90.0\n0 50 100 150 200\nDistance on path (mm)\nSh\nea\nr (\no )\nExperiment\nFE model\nPJN model\nW\nrin\nkl\nin\ng \nst\nra\nin\n \nSh\nea\nr (\no )\n \nFig. 11. Comparison of experimental results, finite element (FE) and kinematic (PJN) model \npredictions. (a) Shear angle along a diagonal path and (b) Green-Lagrange wrinkling strain \nalong a normal path. \n Fig. 11(a) provides a quantitative comparison of the shear distribution along a path of high \nshear starting at one of the corners of the woven material sheet and ending on the apex of the \nhemisphere. The experimental results indicate very low shear at the corner which increases to \na maximum in the middle of the path and a subsequent drop towards zero as the path \napproaches the apex of the hemisphere. The model reproduces the general behaviour closely \nwith small discrepancies in the corner region where the model shows a monotonic increase of \nshear, whereas the experiment indicates a slight decrease in shear in a narrow region before \nthe increase. The results of a kinematic simulation are also shown in Fig. 11(a). The kinematic \nmodel reproduces the experimental behaviour of very low shear in the corner, negligible shear \non the apex and maximum shear in the middle of the diagonal path. However, maximum \nshear predicted by the kinematic simulation is significantly higher, reaching values of 61o, \ndue to the assumed inextensibility and incompressibility of tows. Fig. 11(b) shows a similar \ncomparison for Green-Lagrange wrinkling strain along a path starting in the middle of a side \nof the base and ending on the apex. Measured wrinkling reaches its absolute maximum very \nnear the base and then decreases until it stabilises to small absolute values at a distance of \nabout 35 mm. Measured wrinkling becomes negligible at about 45 mm  from the apex. Model \nresults start from a lower absolute Green-Lagrange wrinkling strain and reproduce the initial \nabsolute wrinkling strain increase over the short distance observed in the experiment. Then \nwrinkling decreases over a region of about 40 mm and becomes negligible at about 70 mm \nfrom the apex. \nOverall, the mode reproduces successfully the shear distribution over the formed component. \nFurthermore, regions of the formed hemisphere where wrinkling due to tow buckling occurs \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nare identified correctly, while maximum absolute wrinkling is underestimated by the model. It \nshould be noted that shear information obtained from the model can also be used for the \nidentification of areas where wrinkling due to shear lock-up occurs, based on the expected \none-to-one correspondence between shear strain and wrinkling strain of this type.  \n \n4.4. Sensitivity study \nThe proposed forming model can be used to investigate the effect of process variables on \nforming. Here the sensitivity of model response to the forming speed and holding force is \nexplored to demonstrate the applicability of the rate dependent model in process optimisation. \nA unit cell size of 10 mm was used, as indicated by the mesh convergence study presented in \nthe previous section. In the investigation of the speed effect, hemisphere forming of the 4\u00d74 \ntwill carbon\/epoxy pre-preg was simulated for forming durations in the range of 8 to 240 s. \nThis corresponds to forming speeds in the range of 0.33 to 10 mm\/s. The total holding force \nwas kept constant at 133 N.  For the investigation of the effect of holding force, the forming \nduration was kept constant at 40 s, i.e. a forming speed of 2 mm\/s, and the total holding force \nwas varied in the range of 70 to 800 N.  \nThe results of the forming model for the sensitivity to speed are illustrated in Fig. 12(a). The \nabsolute value of total wrinkling decreases with decreasing forming speed as a result of the \nincrease in shear compliance of the unit cell with a fall in strain rate. The maximum shear \nangle decreases with speed due to strain rate effects. The results of forming are very sensitive \nto speed at high rates, whereas sensitivity is minimum at very low speeds with both the total \nwrinkling and maximum shear reaching plateau values for forming durations higher than 100 \ns. The decrease in absolute total wrinkling strain from 1.1% at high speeds to 0.3% at low \nspeeds is significant. The corresponding variation in maximum shear is relatively low, in the \nrange of 3o. These results indicate that absolute total wrinkling and maximum shear are \nnegatively correlated. This is a consequence of the fact that the mechanisms of wrinkling due \nto tow buckling and shear are competitive modes of deformation of the woven textile as it \nconforms on the doubly curved tool. Thus, conditions that promote shear, such as slow \nforming of a rate dependent textile, result in less wrinkling and vice versa. The extreme cases \nrepresenting dominance of one of these mechanisms are the pin-jointed net in which \nresistance to shear is negligible and deformation occurs exclusively by shear, and a sheet of \nisotropic material in which resistance to shear is high and deformation during forming occurs \nmainly by wrinkling.   \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \n(b)\n(a)\n-1.20%\n-0.90%\n-0.60%\n-0.30%\n0.00%\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nDuration of forming (s)\nTo\nta\nl w\nrin\nkl\nin\ng \nst\nra\nin\n48.0\n49.0\n50.0\n51.0\n52.0\n53.0\nM\nax\nim\num\n s\nhe\nar\n (\no\n)\nTotal wrinkling strain\nMaximum shear\n-0.80%\n-0.60%\n-0.40%\n-0.20%\n0.00%\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\nTotal holding force (N)\nTo\nta\nl w\nrin\nkl\nin\ng \nst\nra\nin\n50.5\n51.0\n51.5\n52.0\n52.5\nM\nax\nim\num\n s\nhe\nar\n (\no )\nTotal wrinkling strain\nMaximum shear\nTo\nta\nl w\nrin\nkl\nin\ng \nst\nra\nin\nM\nax\nim\num\n s\nhe\nar\n (\no\n)\nTo\nta\nl w\nrin\nkl\nin\ng \nst\nra\nin\nM\nax\nim\num\n s\nhe\nar\n (\no )\n \nFig. 12. Effect of (a) forming speed and (b) total holding force on the maximum shear angle \nand the wrinkling in the forming of the hemisphere. The unit cell size is 10 mm. Total \nwrinkling strain is calculated as the ratio of the sum of wrinkling deformation to the total tow \nlength of the model. \nThe effect of increasing the holding force, as illustrated in Fig. 12(b), is similar to that \nobserved with decreasing forming speed.  Absolute wrinkling decreases from 0.7% at 70 N to \n0.25% at 800 N because of an increase in membrane forces that constrain compression of \ntows.  The sensitivity of total wrinkling to blank holder force is high at low holding forces and \ndecreases with increasing force, reaching an almost constant value for holding forces over 500 \nN. Maximum shear increases with force for low force values. For total holding forces over \n200 N, maximum shear shows a slowly decreasing trend with force.  This result is counter-\nintuitive, as an increase in total holding force is expected to result in higher membrane force \nin the bias direction inducing higher shear in the same woven material under identical \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nconditions. This behaviour, which is manifested at low forces, changes when membrane \nforces are high and can induce significant decrimping. Tow extension results in deformation \nin the tow direction, which contributes to deformation by elongation instead of shear. For \nexample, in the case of total holding force of 800 N, tow strain reaches values close to 0.5%. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nA simplified finite element forming model for pre-impregnated woven textiles is proposed. \nThis simulates the material as a truss of tow and shear elements and can capture wrinkling due \nto buckling of tows and strain rate dependent shear. The unit cell of the model comprises a \nnetwork of pin-jointed bars. Stiff elements represent the tows of the woven material while \nwrinkling is incorporated in the model by deactivating tow elements that undergo \ncompression. The behaviour of the tow elements is non-linear elastic with suitable material \nproperties extracted from tensile tests. Non-linear elastic-viscoplastic elements in the \ndiagonals of the unit cell introduce the rate dependence in shear of the pre-impregnated \nwoven material.  A phenomenological elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model is developed, \nbased on the results of bias extension tests at different strain rates. Friction with the tool \nsurface is incorporated by a group of perfectly plastic elements that exert a constant force at \nnodes of the woven material in contact with the blank holder. The model includes the main \nmechanical effects, while retaining a simplicity which allows effective material parameter \nidentification and iterative execution within an optimisation scheme.   \nThe model is tested against experimental results obtained in the forming of a woven \ncarbon\/epoxy hemisphere. A mesh convergence study shows that the results of the model are \nstable with mesh refinement. A unit cell with a size 6 times smaller than the radius of the \nhemisphere ensures convergence of the model.  The results of the comparison with \nexperimental measurements suggest that the model reproduces successfully the shear field \nand the occurrence of wrinkling due to buckling. Maximum shear values are reproduced \nsuccessfully and regions of significant wrinkling are identified correctly, while maximum \nwrinkling is underestimated.  \nThe proposed model can be implemented easily within a non-linear finite element code that \nhas an appropriate large displacement formulation, implements rate dependent material \nproperties and allows element activation\/deactivation.  The results of a sensitivity study show \nthat the forming process can be influenced significantly by forming speed and holding force.  \nThe simple character of the model allows a computationally efficient incorporation of strain \nComposites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing 38 (2007) 1318-1330 \nrate dependence, wrinkling and influence of peripheral force in a forming simulation. \nCombination of the simplified simulation with optimisation tools can lead to efficient process \ndesign. Future work on process design for industrial components with complicated geometries \nwill use this simplified and computationally efficient method as its core. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nContributions from the University of Nottingham, EPSRC, CONACyT, MSC.Software Ltd, \nDSTL, UK Ministry of Defence, Hexcel Composites, Granta Design Ltd.,  Ford Motor \nCompany Ltd., Polynorm Plastics (UK) Ltd., Virtual Prototyping Solutions Ltd., Saint-\nGobain Vetrotex International SA and ESI Software SA are gratefully acknowledged.
