INTRODUCTION\nIN Borders (U.K.) Ltd. and others v. Commissioner of Police of the\nMetropolis and another,1 the Court of Appeal has, yet again,\nsuccumbed to the \u2018\u2018temptation to do justice\u2019\u20192 by further extending\nto claimants a disgorgement remedy on the claimed authority of\nA.G. v. Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd. Third Party).3 We say \u2018\u2018claimed\nauthority\u2019\u2019 because, yet again, the extension of the disgorgement\nremedy is impossible to justify using legal argument respectful of\nprecedent, for such argument is subordinated to the direct \u2018\u2018pursuit\nof the justice of the outcome\u2019\u2019 ( para. [28]). The court frankly\nacknowledged that its judgement \u2018\u2018has to make up in justice what it\nlacks in logic\u2019\u2019 ( para. [28]). As the court believed the case of the\nsecond defendant (hereinafter the defendant) to be wholly\n\u2018\u2018unembarrassed by any merits\u2019\u2019 ( para. [14]), \u2018\u2018justice\u2019\u2019 appeared to\nrequire that he be mulcted, and this is what the court has made it\npossible for the claimant, with the particular assistance of the state\nin this case, most thoroughly to do.\nAnd, yet again, all this is unwise. The defendant, who received a\nterm of 30 months\u2019 imprisonment for the offences which gave rise\nto this litigation, could not be said to be in the strongest position.\nBut as the court\u2019s treatment of even this defendant is wholly\nquestionable as policy, the outcome the court has striven to\nproduce is bereft of justification. If one leaves the shelter of\nprecedent to embark upon judicial legislation, one had better\nidentify the right policy. Why it has become quite common for\nappeal court judges to believe they are able to perform the very\ndifficult trick of legislation from the bench will not be discussed\nhere.

Or, to put the matter the other way around, the\nBlake remedy is itself so wholly opposed to the balance and\ncautious growth central to the common law of damages that it can\nbe advanced only by this sort of reasoning, which disdains the\n\u2018\u2018straight-jacket\u2019\u2019 of precedent in order to give a decision which\nserves \u2018\u2018the interests of justice\u2019\u2019 ( para. [43]).\nII. THE FACTS AND THE PROCEEDINGS4\nOn 16 January 2004, the defendant, Mr. Ronald Jordan, a street\ntrader, was convicted by Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to\nsteal and of handling stolen goods. For at least three years\npreviously, Jordan had employed thieves to steal books from the\nbookshops of inter alios the claimants, members of the Booksellers\u2019\nAssociation Loss Protection Consortium (BALPC), which he then\nsold from street market stalls. Jordan appears to have organised the\ntheft of some 250,000(!) books, from the sale of which he made an\nestimated annual profit of over \u00a3300,000, of which over \u00a3600,000\nwas identified to him during the criminal proceedings.\nJordan was a brazen criminal. He constantly operated his\nmarket stalls without licences and accepted consequent arrests and\nfines as a cost of doing business (to the extent that he ever paid the\nfines). He constantly attempted to evade payment of tax. He chose\nfor his thieves mainly drug addicts who, desperate for cash, would\nsell him the books they had stolen for small sums by comparison to\nthe price for which he then sold them. It is only a certain sort of\nperson who would be able successfully to deal in ready cash with\ndrug addicts in this way, and Jordan used intimidation to assist\nhim in resisting investigation of the source of his stock (some of\nwhich was obtained legally). But Jordan was no master criminal.\nHe eventually was imprisoned because he simply persisted in\nfoolishly ignoring the possibility of his ultimate conviction, and so\nmuch of his proceeds remained to be identified to him because he\nwas an unsavoury man who, despite his wealth, continued to live in\nrepulsive squalor.\nCriminal proceedings to confiscate (part of ) the \u00a3600,000 were\nbegun under sections 71 and 72AA of the Criminal Justice Act\n1988.5 These were adjourned pending the outcome of the present\ncase. Also as part of the criminal proceedings, the claimants\n4 In addition to the facts stated in Borders itself, we have read many newspaper, trade paper,\nlocal authority and police accounts of Jordan\u2019s career, the most full of which appears to be R.\nHanks, \u2018\u2018Brought to Book\u2019\u2019 (9 March 2004) The Independent.\n5 The Criminal Justice Act 1988, pt. 2 has been superseded by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002,\npt. 2.\nC.L.J. Damages At The Borders Of Legal Reasoning 209\napplied for a compensation order under section 130 of the Powers\nof the Criminal Courts Act 2000. Subsequent to the assessment of\ndamages in the present, civil action, this application was\nwithdrawn.\nFor reasons which will not be discussed here, establishing the\nevidence necessary to convict Jordan was extremely difficult,\ninvolving numerous frustrated attempts to prosecute him prior to\nthe ultimately successful one. The eventual securing of a conviction\nrequired a very considerable effort on the part of the claimants,\nwho had formed BALPC largely in the attempt to close down\nJordan\u2019s operation, and who had to go to great lengths, such as\nmarking their stock with ultraviolet ink and having Jordan placed\nunder observation, to do so. It also required, in the words of the\ncriminal trial judge, \u2018\u2018immense application\u2019\u2019 by the City of London\nPolice.6 We imagine, though it is not clear from the transcript, that\nthese circumstances played some part in the claimant framing what\nappears to be a most conservative claim for compensatory\ndamages. The present action concerned only fewer than 50,000\nbooks seized from Jordan\u2019s stall, van, house and lock-up, and\nJordan\u2019s claim that he had been running his operation for only\nthree years was accepted, as was police evidence which calculated\nJordan\u2019s profit per book at what appears to be a very low figure.\nIn the first hearing of the present, civil action, the claimants\nwere awarded compensatory damages of \u00a3279,594.89 in total.\nIgnoring a subsidiary component of this award, its bulk,\n\u00a3233,143.25, was compensation for the conversion of 42,102 books,\nassessed as the retail price of the books when stolen minus their\nresale value when recovered. Though we shall comment on this use\nof the retail price of the books below,7 we will eschew discussion of\nthe precise quantification of the compensatory damages, which had\naspects which worked both for and against the defendant.\nThe present appeal turned on a further award of \u00a3100,000 in\nexemplary damages. Master Leslie, assessing the compensatory\ndamages, undoubtedly believed that 42,102 books represented only\na fraction of the books Jordan had converted, and that he actually\nmade more profit per book than the police evidence claimed.\nAlthough he allowed Jordan credit for overheads, such as running\nhis van and lock-up, Master Leslie arrived at round figures of\n\u00a320,000, \u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000 as the net profits from Jordan\u2019s sales\nof these books over three years, and awarded their sum of \u00a3100,000\n6 Anon, \u2018\u2018City Police Shut Down Book Theft Network\u2019\u2019 (6 February 2004) City of London Police\nNews and Events 5 http:\/\/www.cityoflondon.police.uk\/news\/2004\/feb-6\u201304.html4 .\n7 See the text accompanying note 59 below.\n210 The Cambridge Law Journal [2006]\nas exemplary damages. In justification of this award, Master Leslie\nsaid:\nI am confident that [Jordan] earned a great deal more than\nthat . . . But I also bear in mind that there is an element of\npunishment here\u2014but it is not really punishment: it is intended\nto be\u2014and I think I am entitled to say this on the\nauthorities\u2014a deprivation of wholly wrongfully obtained\nprofit. That is the way the claim is put in the particulars of\nclaim and it is the way I have attempted to assess these\nexemplary damages (quoted at para. [11]).\nIII. THE USE OF BLAKE\nIn Borders, even more than in Experience Hendrix LLC v. PPX\nEnterprises Inc., Edward Chalpin,8 it is not at all clear why the\nclaimant chose to state its claim in the, to quote the Court of\nAppeal, \u2018\u2018hazardous\u2019\u2019 way it did (para. [13]). Ignoring the marked\nconservatism of the basic claim for compensatory damages, it\nremains unclear why the claimant did not claim further\ncompensatory damages in respect of the books which were not\nrecovered. The argument need not be pursued at length because the\nCourt of Appeal told us that it would have succeeded had it been\nused at first instance (para. [13]), as the court believes it should\nhave been (para. [28]). If it had, then, of course, \u2018\u2018the issue [of the\nappeal] . . . need never have arisen\u2019\u2019 ( para. [12]).\nThere are two reasons why the course taken by the claimants\nwas so hazardous. First, as the criminal proceedings already\ncontemplated securing part or all of Jordan\u2019s \u00a3600,000 by means of\nconfiscation and compensation, and as the Criminal Justice Act\n1988, section 71(1C) permitted but did not require that sums\nrecovered from a defendant by civil action be set off against\nconfiscation proceedings, a civil award threatened to expose Jordan\nto the \u2018\u2018double jeopardy\u2019\u2019 ( para. [17]) of loss of the \u00a3100,000 twice\n(para. [14]).9 This is not only abhorrent in principle but was\nspecifically disapproved in the important case of Archer v. Brown.10\nFor reasons which do not appear to be publicly available, but the\nnature of which it is possible to imagine, the court has stated that\nit could \u2018\u2018confidently anticipate that Mr. Jordan will not be mulcted\n8 [2003] EWCA Civ 323, [2003] 1 All E.R. (Comm.) 830.\n9 And equally to, potentially, allow the claimants double recovery, on which see the text\nassociated with note 28 below.\n10 [1985] Q.B. 401, 426. The Law Commission, Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary\nDamages (Report No. 247, 1997) paras. 4.36\u20134.43 has queried the position set out in Archer v.\nBrown, and, although the case is not discussed in this perfectly opaque part of the reasoning\nin Borders, no doubt Borders will sanction such questioning.\nC.L.J. Damages At The Borders Of Legal Reasoning 211\nin the same sum twice\u2019\u2019 ( para. [17]).11 Whilst we find this position\nextremely unsatisfactory, we propose to leave it for discussion by\nthose more competent to deal with this latest blurring of the\ncriminal and the civil law, though undoubtedly the most important\naspect of this case is that it shows how much the appeal courts\ncurrently are prepared to assist in this blurring.\nThe second reason why the claimants\u2019 course was hazardous is\nthat it involves an extension of exemplary damages. For the\nclaimant to succeed, what should have been pleaded as\ncompensatory damages have to be recoverable as exemplary\ndamages, and one of the very few things one can say with\nconfidence about the vexed topic of exemplary damages is that\nthere is no clear authority for this. The Court of Appeal states that:\n\u2018\u2018The key issue is . . . whether there is today any room within the\nconcept of exemplary damages for quantified losses, or whether the\ntwo are mutually exclusive\u2019\u2019 ( para. [18]), and draws on the\nauthority of Lord Nicholls in Kuddus v. Chief Constable of\nLeicestershire Constabulary12 to say what is so uncontroversial as to\nneed no discussion here, that there is, \u2018\u2018to all appearances, a\ndoctrine of mutual exclusivity\u2019\u2019 between compensatory and\nexemplary damages, such that the latter are \u2018\u2018additional to,\u2019\u2019 not\ncongruent with, the former (para. [22]).\nThe Court of Appeal also notes what is equally uncontroversial:\nthat in Rookes v. Barnard exemplary damages were identified as \u2018\u2018an\nanomaly\u2019\u2019 which it was regretted could not be abolished,13 and that\nthat case, reinforced by Broome v. Cassell and Co. Ltd.,14 sought to\nconfine those damages to their scope in 1964. There now is, for\nreasons which constraints of space prevent us from going into here,\nacademic argument for the extension of exemplary damages,\nsupported, after much thought, by the Law Commission,15 and\n11 The court tells us that this means that \u2018\u2018the probable practical relevance of the appeal is to\ndecide whether the \u00a3100,000 . . . goes to the . . . victims under the civil judgement or to the\nstate under the confiscation order\u2019\u2019 ( para. [46]). With respect, this does not explain the reasons\nfor the abandonment of the criminal proceedings for compensation. Under the Criminal\nJustice Act 1988, as amended, a compensation order took precedence over a confiscation\norder; the Crown Court could award an unlimited sum in compensation; and, despite his\nsentence of imprisonment, Jordan had the means with which to meet a compensation order. It\nwould appear that the court has accepted that it was not possible to obtain more than\n\u00a3233,143.25 through a criminal compensation order, where loss must be proven (R v. Watson\n(1990) 12 Cr. App. R. (S) 508), and the court must not \u2018\u2018simply pluck a figure out of the air\u2019\u2019\n(R. v. Swann and Webster (1984) 6 Cr. App. R. (S) 22, 25, both cases interpreting legislation\nfrom which The Powers of the Criminal Courts Act 2000, s. 130 is derived), and has turned to\nthe civil law because it would make a greater sum available to the claimant, as indeed it\nwould if the court\u2019s treatment of exemplary damages were good law.\n12 [2002] 2 A.C. 122, at paras. [50]\u2013[52].\n13 [1964] A.C. 1129, 1221, 1225\u201326.\n14 [1972] A.C. 1027, 1082.\n15 Law Commission, note 10 above, para. 1.14. The personal views of the Law Commissioner at\nthe time of the Report, Professor Burrows, tended towards the abolition of exemplary\ndamages: A. Burrows, Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract, 2nd ed. (London 1994),\n212 The Cambridge Law Journal [2006]\nKuddus, as we shall see, manages the extraordinary feat of arguing for\nboth the abolition and the extension of these damages.16 Nevertheless,\nthe Court of Appeal recognises that the English civil law displays an\nantipathy to exemplary damages and particularly to their extension;\nand this is, in our opinion,17 right as law and right as policy (if\nabolition is not available).\nThe reader of the previous two paragraphs may, then, be\nsurprised to be told that the result of the Court of Appeal\u2019s\njudgement is that the claimants were able to recover the \u00a3100,000\nas exemplary damages. The argument, so far as it may be rationally\nreconstructed, is as follows.\nBy far the most important of the three \u2018\u2018categories\u2019\u2019 of cases in\nwhich Rookes v. Barnard allowed exemplary damages to be\nawarded is the second identified by Lord Devlin: where the\ndefendant, with \u2018\u2018a cynical disregard\u2019\u2019 for the claimant\u2019s rights, \u2018\u2018has\ncalculated that the money to be made out of his wrongdoing will\nprobably exceed the damages at risk.\u2019\u201918 As Rookes v. Barnard was\ndecided in what now seems like a very remote world where a strong\ndistinction was drawn between criminal and civil law, a distinction\nRookes v. Barnard itself sought to strengthen,19 one might well\nargue that the calculation one imagines Jordan made in respect of\nthe criminal offences which led to this litigation does not fit into\nthe second category, which Lord Devlin was prepared to accept did\nnot cover \u2018\u2018malicious injuries to property\u2019\u2019 because such injuries\n\u2018\u2018can generally be punished as crimes.\u2019\u201920 But, although we shall say\na little more of the confusion of criminal and civil law in this case,\nas Jordan\u2019s cynical disregard for BALPC\u2019s interests can hardly be\ndoubted, let us accept that Borders fits into the second category of\nexemplary damages.\nAs it was the case that the Court of Appeal believed the\n\u00a3100,000 to be, in reality, compensatory damages, even if one\naccepts that the \u00a3100,000 is the product of Jordan\u2019s cynical\ndisregard, there still remains the question \u2018\u2018of the calculus on which\nthe purportedly exemplary award was sought and made\u2019\u2019 ( para.\npp. 282\u20135 and A.

Harris et al., Remedies in Contract and Tort, 2nd ed. (London 2002), ch. 30.\n18 Rookes v. Barnard [1964] A.C. 1129, 1227. Another formulation given in Broome v. Cassell\nand Co. Ltd. [1972] A.C. 1027, 1079 was that the defendant\u2019s \u2018\u2018prospects of material\nadvantage outweigh the prospects of material loss.\u2019\u2019\n19 Rookes v. Barnard [1964] A.C. 1129, 1230 per Lord Devlin: \u2018\u2018I do not care for the idea that in\nmatters criminal an aggrieved party should be given an option to inflict for his own benefit\npunishment by a method which denies to the offender the protection of the criminal law.\u2019\u2019 See\nalso Broome v. Cassell and Co. Ltd. [1972] A.C. 1027, 1087 per Lord Reid: \u2018\u2018to allow pure\npunishment in this way contravenes almost every principle which has been evolved for the\nprotection of offenders.\u2019\u2019\n20 Rookes v. Barnard [1964] A.C. 1221, 1230.\nC.L.J. Damages At The Borders Of Legal Reasoning 213\n[24]). Lord Devlin\u2019s second category looks to give something\nadditional to render fruitless the defendant\u2019s calculation about his\nliability for compensation of the claimant\u2019s loss. It was never\ncontemplated that compensatory damages as such would be\nawarded as exemplary damages. The notion makes no sense in\nterms of what we have previously understood of exemplary\ndamages. The Court of Appeal overcame this problem, to its own\nsatisfaction at least, by saying that what is really going on in Lord\nDevlin\u2019s second category is the prevention of unjust enrichment\n(para. [25]). The court placed great reliance on comments which\ncan, in their differing ways, be interpreted to this effect in Lord\nDiplock\u2019s speech in Broome v. Cassell,21 and in Lord Scott\u2019s speech\nin Kuddus.22 But, in truth, the court does not seek to follow the law\nbut, though conscious it \u2018\u2018is not a source of present law\u2019\u2019 (para.\n[26]), to follow the argument of McGregor on Damages, that \u2018\u2018the\nreal purpose behind this second common law category is not the\npunishment of the defendant but the prevention of his unjust\nenrichment.\u2019\u201923 In sum, McGregor\u2019s argument\nhelps to bring the two theories (of exemplary and\nrestitutionary damages) into a single frame by suggesting (as\nLord Scott suggested in Kuddus) that a modern enhanced\ncompensatory regime is capable of subsuming the need for\npunitive awards. When one recalls that the rationale of the\nsecond category of exemplary damages is, precisely, the\nconfiscation of profits which cannot be got at through the\nordinary compensatory mechanisms, this is an attractive\nsynthesis ( para. [26]).\nWe do not pretend to be able to expound fully the chain of\nreasoning the court thought it was setting out here, but wish to\nmake two points, not, in the first instance at least, about this form\nof reasoning, but about the substance of the position the court\ntakes up.24\n21 [1972] A.C. 1027, 1129.\n22 [2002] 2 A.C. 122, at para. [109].\n23 17th ed. (London 2003), para. 11.027.\n24 In a desperate attempt to preserve some order in our discussion of this convoluted and\nconfused case, we shall relegate to a footnote one other point of substance which might be\nmade. The Court of Appeal focusses on Lord Devlin\u2019s categories test, but nowhere deals with\nthe problems that must be caused by the fact that, as no common law cases of exemplary\ndamages for conversion had been decided prior to Rookes v. Barnard, what the court does\ncontradicts Lord Devlin\u2019s \u2018\u2018cause of action\u2019\u2019 test. This test, an unsatisfactory compromise at\nbest, is probably outright indefensible in respect of conversion, for trespass to goods does\nsatisfy the cause of action test; and, anyway, after Kuddus, note 12 above, it would appear\nthat the cause of action test by no means absolute: cf. Banks v. Cox [2002] EWHC 2166, at\npara. [13] on deceit, discussed by one of the current authors in J. Poole and J. Devenney,\n\u2018\u2018Reforming Damages for Misrepresentation: The Case for Coherent Aims and Principles\u2019\u2019\n[2006] J.B.L. (forthcoming). Largely disregarding the cause of action test, we shall consider\nwhether exemplary damages should be awarded.\n214 The Cambridge Law Journal [2006]\nThe argument throughout Borders is that the \u00a3100,000 should\nhave been pleaded as compensatory damages. When it is awarded\non the Blake basis of disgorgement of enrichment by wrongdoing,\nit is not awarded as compensatory damages at all. If we can be\nexcused for stating the obvious, the whole point of Blake is that the\ndisgorgement remedy it made available for breach of simple\ncontract is an alternative to compensatory damages because, it is\nclaimed, such damages are inadequate. In Borders, it is believed\nthat the claimants, even after receiving the \u00a3100,000, though better\ncompensated, will still be inadequately compensated. Is it to be the\ncase that, in future cases, disgorgement will be available only to\n(partially) remedy otherwise inadequate compensatory awards, or\nwill the disgorgement remedy be available when compensation is\nadequate or, because the claimant suffers no loss (e.g. trespass\nwhich does not inflict damage to the land), damages are nominal?\nWe are faced with a recapitulation of the unresolved, and\nunresolvable, dispute of whether what was done in Wrotham Park\nEstate Co. Ltd. v. Parkside Homes Ltd.25 was a form of\ncompensation or a form of restitution.26 It was bad enough when\none did not know whether the compensatory or the restitutionary\nmeasure, or both, should be available to claimants. Now, it seems,\ncompensation is available as restitution in the form of exemplary\ndamages, whatever this means; and in our opinion, given most\nhesitantly, it means nothing. Even if it did mean something, the\nproblem set by Wrotham Park is increased. In addition to having to\nask which sort of case justifies a departure from \u2018\u2018axiomatic\u2019\u2019\ncompensatory damages,27 we now have to ask which sort of case\nallows one to claim compensatory damages as \u2018\u2018exemplary-\nrestitutionary\u2019\u2019 damages. It is evident that the Court of Appeal has\nmanaged to do what one thought was impossible by increasing the\nconfusion that attends the distinction between \u2018\u2018aggravated\u2019\u2019 (as\nextra-compensatory) and \u2018\u2018exemplary\u2019\u2019 (as punitive) damages. We\ncannot say anything helpful about this.\nIt is also clear that, though the court was prepared to do more\nor less anything to improve the claimants\u2019 award by allowing \u2018\u2018the\nconfiscation [sic] of profits which cannot be got at through the\nordinary compensatory mechanisms\u2019\u2019 ( para. [26]), it did so only to\nbetter approximate to the level of what the court believed to be the\nclaimants\u2019 real loss. The court would not have awarded more than\na limit set by the claimants\u2019 real loss, for such an award would be\n25 [1974] 1 W.L.R. 798.\n26 Harris et al., note 17 above, pp. 258\u201362.\n27 A.G. v. Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd. Third Party) [1998] Ch. 439, 448 (C.A.); [2001] 1 A.C.\n268, 282 (H.L.).\nC.L.J. Damages At The Borders Of Legal Reasoning 215\na \u2018\u2018double recovery\u2019\u2019 windfall to them (paras. [27], [43] and [47]).\nBut does this (ironically) mean that there is a cap on the\nrestitutionary recovery set by the limit of compensation of loss?\nIgnoring the fact that this requires the court to maintain it knows\nwhat this loss is (on other than the submitted evidence in support\nof statements of claim which were not actually made), it is a\ndoctrinal development which will involve some difficulty, especially\nin respect of what seem to be relevant discussions of expectation\nceilings in other areas of the law of damages.28\nNotwithstanding what has just been said, perhaps the most\nextraordinary aspect of what is being done is that the authorities to\nwhich reference is made, even the persuasive authority of\nMcGregor, are all being turned against themselves by a Court of\nAppeal which does not seem to realise what it is doing. The court\nmakes reference, as we have seen, to Lord Scott\u2019s speech in Kuddus.\nBut in his speech his Lordship argued that, as, after Blake, \u2018\u2018the\nprofit made by a wrongdoer can be extracted from him\u2019\u2019 by\nrestitutionary damages, there no longer is any need \u2018\u2018to rely on the\nanomaly of exemplary damages.\u2019\u201929 This is, to spell it out, an\nargument that exemplary damages can be curtailed (on the way to\nbeing dispensed with) if what Lord Devlin allowed under his\nsecond category can be placed on a restitutionary footing. It is not\nan argument that compensatory or restitutionary damages can be\nplaced on an exemplary footing! The court does not seem to\nappreciate that the criticism of exemplary damages tout court is at\nleast as much to the fore in Kuddus30 as the criticism of the cause\nof action test that, whilst right in itself, admittedly was bound to\nhave the opposite effect to the abolition of those damages. But the\nambivalence of Kuddus can hardly be said to be characteristic of\nRookes v. Barnard or Broome v. Cassell, which, of course, as the\ncourt ( para. [19]), and everybody else, perfectly well knows, display\na most grudging acceptance of exemplary damages. Nor is there\nmuch doubt about the nature of the argument from McGregor\nadopted by the court, for McGregor also seeks to diminish the\nscope of exemplary damages, looking forward to \u2018\u2018the day when\nrestitutionary damages will take over from Lord Devlin\u2019s second\ncategory and make it unnecessary.\u2019\u201931 This really must be a case of\nmaking the best of a bad lot, for McGregor also bitterly regrets\nthat it \u2018\u2018reluctantly\u2019\u2019 now has to talk of \u2018\u2018restitutionary damages\u2019\u2019 at\n28 Harris et al., note 17 above, pp. 238\u201340.\n29 [2002] 2 A.C. 122, at para. [109].\n30 E.g. [2002] 2 A.C. 122, at para. [72].\n31 McGregor, note 23 above, para. 11.046.\n216 The Cambridge Law Journal [2006]\nall.32 In sum, even if one allows that interesting debate has been\njoined over the possibility of a restitutionary reinterpretation of\nLord Devlin\u2019s \u2018\u2018cynical disregard\u2019\u2019 category,33 the Court of Appeal\u2019s\nuse of Blake to expand the use of exemplary damages is, we are\nreluctantly obliged to say, no more than an outre\u00b4 interruption of\nthis debate.\nPerhaps it is wrong to dwell too long on the reasoning in\nBorders. It is an evident hatchet-job, made, it would seem, to\nensure (after what the court seems to view as a questionable\nstatement of case supported by inadequate evidence) that the\ndefendant was punished and the claimants better compensated. And\nif one has already decided that justice requires the mulcting of a\ndefendant in this way, then it would be a trivial accomplishment\nfor far less able ratiocinators than Court of Appeal judges to use\nBlake to mulct him. The thrust of Blake is so flatly towards the\nprevention of wrongs that it has made it possible to require\ndisgorgement for simple breach of contract, the \u2018\u2018wrong\u2019\u2019 for which\nit is least appropriate to regard disgorgement as a default remedy,34\nand so requiring disgorgement in other circumstances is child\u2019s\nplay.\nAll equivocation aside, in the restitutionary jurisprudence of\nBlake, wrongs are persuasively defined as, precisely, wrong, and\ncorrective justice requires their prevention. Restitutionary damages\nwhich will be larger than compensatory damages will be more likely\nto prevent the wrong, with the complete disgorgement of the gains\nthe defendant makes by commission of the wrong which is\nsanctioned by Blake being the logical apotheosis of the argument.\nBut the suggestion \u2018\u2018that there is a universally applicable principle\nthat in every case there will be restitution of benefit from a\nwrong\u2019\u201935 is a na\u0131\u00a8ve formalism which typically does not understand\n32 Ibid., para. 12.004. And, with all respect to McGregor, it has failed to give sufficient weight to\na problem which, as one of the authors has already noted, attends its similar treatment of\nWrotham Park hypothetical release damages: D. Campbell, \u2018\u2018The Extinguishing of Contract\u2019\u2019\n(2004) 67 M, L.R. 818, 823 note 24. What if there is a cynical tort committed in the\nexpectation of profit but the profit does not in fact materialise? We do not doubt for a second\nthat the proponents of restitution are able to come up with something that suits the purpose,\nindeed may already have done so; but will it improve our law to replace exemplary damages\nwith restitution of an unjust enrichment that does not enrich? This difficulty had been noted\nin Broome v. Cassell and Co. Ltd. [1972] A.C. 1027, 1130.\n33 But see Design Progression Limited v. Thurloe Properties Limited [2004] EWHC 324, [2005] 1\nW.L.R. 1, at para.

STILL NO TELLING\nWhat is much harder than applying the Blake remedy is, having\ngot it to hand, developing a jurisprudence which allows one to\nknow when and when not to use it. One can always make an\nargument for using it, as the Court of Appeal has facilely done in\nBorders. What the court has failed to do is develop at all robust\nrules for deciding when, as a matter of law rather than prior\nintuition about what is just, the Blake remedy should or should not\nbe used.\nWe have been told that circumstances have to be \u2018\u2018exceptional\u2019\u2019\nto justify the Blake remedy,39 but we have no way of telling what\nthose circumstances are.40 One way which was canvassed by the\nCourt of Appeal which heard Blake is to focus on \u2018\u2018the moral\ncalibre of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019\u201941 That the breach was\n\u2018\u2018deliberate and cynical,\u2019\u2019 or involved \u2018\u2018skimping on performance\u2019\u2019\nor \u2018\u2018doing exactly what one promised one would not do,\u2019\u2019 were\nadvanced as circumstances justifying the alternative award.42 But\nserious reflection shows that, for reasons which one of the present\nauthors has already discussed many times elsewhere and so will not\nbe recapitulated here,43 all of these are unsatisfactory reasons to\ndepart from compensatory damages, and there was a marked\nhesitation about all of them in the House of Lords\u2019 hearing of\nBlake.44 They have surfaced in cases subsequent to Blake, but, in\nthe interests of coherent legal argument, they have no business\ndoing so.45\n36 Campbell and Harris, note 34 above.\n37 D.

NIAD Ltd., unreported, 22 November 2001 (Ch.D.), at para. [60]. But it\n218 The Cambridge Law Journal [2006]\nIn Borders, it is the law of exemplary damages that furnishes the\ngrounds for the Blake award. \u2018\u2018Exemplary damages,\u2019\u2019 we are told,\n\u2018\u2018fill a moral gap\u2019\u2019 ( para. [26]), and \u2018\u2018can be awarded, ultimately in\nthe interests of justice, to punish and deter outrageous conduct on\nthe part of the defendant\u2019\u2019 ( para. [43]). So long as one\u2019s own\ninterests are not at the mercy of this sort of stuff, one can hardly\nsuppress a smile at the thought of turning to the law of exemplary\ndamages to assist the refinement of our damages jurisprudence, but\nlet us examine what is involved. If, starting with Lord Devlin\u2019s\nsecond category, we are to base an extension of exemplary damages\non the \u2018\u2018cynicism\u2019\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s conduct, then surely Borders\ncreates the new problem that this runs completely counter to the\nretreat from the \u2018\u2018deliberate and cynical\u2019\u2019 ground by the House of\nLords in Blake!46 This obviously means that awarding a\ndisgorgement remedy, supposedly derived from Blake, as exemplary\ndamages on the supposed authority of Lord Devlin\u2019s second\ncategory, is quite contradictory. In sum, we can only repeat what\none of the current authors has already said of the law on this point\nafter Blake: that law is a dreadful mess, and nothing ultimately can\nbe done to straighten this mess out.47\nFor those who have reached this conclusion to advance further\ncomment on Blake can be justified only by their seeking to limit\nthe mischief that this case is causing, and it is to the specific\nmischief in Borders that we now turn. To come to terms with\ndecisions like Borders, one is wise to abandon most of what one\nknows of legal reasoning and simply recognise outright that the\ncourt, because it believes it knows what is just for reasons, as it\nwere, prior to the decided law, has sought to mulct the defendant,\nand Blake, which is based on a blanket repugnance of wrongdoing,\nis just the tool for this job. Faced with this, the only way to\nconduct a productive discussion of the detail of cases like Borders\nis in Experience Hendrix LLC v. PPX Enterprises Inc, Edward Chalpin [2003] EWCA Civ 323,\n[2003] 1 All E.R. (Comm.) 830, at para. [44] that some sort of measuring of the moral\nturpitude thought to be involved in the wrongdoing has so far been most fully canvassed,\nwith George Blake\u2019s treason the nadir to which the conduct of others could be compared.\nJordan\u2019s criminality might be thought to give rise to the closest set of facts to Blake which\nhave so far arisen. But we are spared having to describe the difficulties of the moral\nestimations called for in Hendrix because the court does not bother with them in Borders.\nHaving assumed that Jordan\u2019s position does not have \u2018\u2018arguments\u2019\u2019, it no doubt is difficult to\nconsider whether, after all, there might not be a difference between Ronald Jordan\u2019s\ncriminality and Blake\u2019s treason, but we shall return to the nature of Jordan\u2019s criminality\nbelow.\n46 Once again in an attempt to preserve order in our argument, we confine to a footnote the\nclash of the Court of Appeal\u2019s approach in Borders with the Law Commission\u2019s argument\n(note 10 above, para. 1.52) for placing damages for \u2018\u2018proprietary torts\u2019\u2019 such as conversion on\na restitutionary footing. A major advantage of so doing was claimed to be that it made it\npossible to award damages in excess of the compensatory measure in the absence of\n\u2018\u2018deliberate and outrageous conduct,\u2019\u2019 for \u2018\u2018the basis of the restitutionary liability is strict.\u2019\u2019\n47 Campbell and Wylie, note 40 above, p. 610.\nC.L.J. Damages At The Borders Of Legal Reasoning 219\nwhich purport to follow Blake is to put the damage to the rule of\nlaw to one side and ask what is the merit as policy of what is\ndone?\nV. FAGIN IN THE MODERN MANNER\nIt was inevitable that the Court of Appeal would take up the\npopular description48 of Jordan as a \u2018\u2018literary\u2019\u2019 Fagin (para. [1]), for\nso, indeed, he was. But there is an irony in this description which\nthe court fails to appreciate. For Jordan was a \u2018\u2018modern day\u2019\u201949\nFagin in a strong sense, in that the rationale of his crime is\ntraceable to developments in the law around the time when, in\n1838, Dickens published Oliver Twist. For the essential aspect of\nJordan\u2019s crime was not that it involved theft, but that it involved\ncopyright. In 1838, prior to the Copyright Act 1842,50 effective\ncopyright protection was vestigial by comparison to what now\nexists,51 and Dickens himself felt sufficiently angry about what he\nbelieved to be the inadequate protection of his work that he\nattacked the existing law in a famous passage of Nicholas\nNickleby.52 Dickens had an important role in the development of\nmodern copyright, for he successfully put his tremendous influence\nparticularly behind improving international protection (his sales in\nthe United States, and associated earnings particularly from reading\ntours there, were very large).53 Things are rather different now, and\nJordan\u2019s operation was a response to the very extensive system of\ncopyright protection that now obtains.\nThe size and success of Jordan\u2019s operation, and its longevity in\nview of its size, are, on a first look, remarkable. The Court of\nAppeal states its view of the reason for this success briefly: \u2018\u2018Since\nhis overheads and outlays were somewhat less onerous than those\nof a legitimate bookseller, Mr. Jordan made very considerable\nprofits\u2019\u2019 ( para. [1]). This is, with all respect, an insufficient\nunderstanding of Jordan\u2019s business to ground judicial legislation in\nrespect of the mischief it posed. In order to realise his profits from\nthe stolen books, Jordan had to sell them, and this he had no\ntrouble whatsoever in doing. He was able to sell an average of 100\nbooks a day, seven days a week, all the year round, for a number\n48 Anon, \u2018\u2018Book Theft Boss Must Pay Damages\u2019\u2019 (3 March 2005) BBC News 5http:\/\/\nnews.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/uk_news\/england\/london\/4314663.stm4 .\n49 J.

He is likely to have had tens of thousands of customers.\nIt cannot, therefore, be denied that there was a very strong demand\nfor what he was doing. This was so because the price of the books\nwhen sold by members of BALPC, under protection of the\ncopyright monopoly, was much higher than the price which would\nhave been fixed by competition.54 Jordan\u2019s overheads and outlays\nwere indeed \u2018\u2018less onerous\u2019\u2019 than those of the members of BALPC,\nbut the level of their overheads and outlays is set within a\nframework in which the price competition which would drive that\nlevel down is heavily restricted. For Jordan to undercut the price\ncharged by the members of BALPC was rather easy, and it is not\nnearly enough to say that he did this only by illegal means, for\nmost price competition in bookselling would contravene the\nCopyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.\nWe hope to have made our opinion of Jordan\u2019s personal\nqualities clear. The point is that the current regulatory framework\nmakes it highly likely that only persons of his stamp will make\nprice competition the basis of their business should they engage in\nbookselling. And as economic policy normally does not seek to\neliminate but to promote price competition because it is an\ninestimable good, it is a significant mistake to believe, as we have\nseen the Court of Appeal centrally does believe, that even Jordan\u2019s\nposition is wholly \u2018\u2018unembarrassed by any merits\u2019\u2019 ( para. [14]).\nEven in this case, it is not necessarily a question of continually\ndevising laws which ever more thoroughly mulct the defendant. It is\na question of balance.\nThough it would seem that even our small competence to\ndiscuss the law and economics of the book trade is greater than\nthat of the Court of Appeal, because, on the evidence of its view of\nthe nature of Jordan\u2019s business, the court\u2019s competence is zero, this\nis not the place to do so. However, that the court has seen fit to\nengage in judicial legislation gives rise to two questions. The first is:\nis it sensible to grant a copyright monopoly which will be bound to\ncreate a very substantial incentive to its infringement, and to\ncriminal acts if the infringement is defined as criminal, or to\ncriminal acts pursuant to the infringement whether or not the\ninfringement is itself criminalised? The second is: is it sensible to\nseek to extend criminal and civil remedies to make the monopoly\nabsolute? The economic and legal justifications for copyright in\ngeneral are wholly questionable,55 and the shape the industrial\n54 We ignore the collective administration of prices central to the book trade until recently,\nwhich was supposed to have come to an end with the abandonment of the Net Book\nAgreement in 1995.\n55 For the views of one of the present authors see S. Picciotto and D. Campbell, \u2018\u2018Whose\nMolecule Is It Anyway? Private and Social Perspectives on Intellectual Property\u2019\u2019 in A.\nC.L.J. Damages At The Borders Of Legal Reasoning 221\norganization of the book trade has taken under the influence of the\ncopyright monopoly is widely deprecated for its economic\nshortcomings56 and its encouragement of philistinism.57 However,\nthe very existence of the statutory copyright regime, and a fortiori\nits flourishing state, makes it unprofitable to discuss the matter at\nthis fundamental level here; for our purposes, the existence of\ncopyright must be accepted. What can be discussed with profit is\nthe extent of the protection that adjudication should recognise is\nafforded to the copyright monopoly and how this relates to what\nwas done in Borders.\nThe underlying moral atmosphere of Borders is a feeling that\nsomething must be done \u2018\u2018in the interests of justice\u2019\u2019 to prevent the\nclaimants being inadequately compensated. But the basic measure\nof the compensatory damages awarded, of the retail value of the\nbooks when they were stolen (minus their resale value when\nrecovered), though defensible as conversion damages, arguably itself\ninvolves very considerable overcompensation. Had the claimants\nmerely replenished the books from the printers, the cost of doing so\nwould have been a small fraction of the resale value. We are not\narguing that the cost of replacement in this way is the right\nmeasure of damages, but it is most important to see that what\nreally is at issue in Borders is not the conversion of the physical\nbooks but the \u2018\u2018conversion\u2019\u2019 of the revenues which accrue from the\ncopyright monopoly, and once this is acknowledged, then the\nwaters become very deep indeed. It is particularly unfortunate that\nBorders proceeds without reference to the extensive criticism58 of\nthe punitive nature and excessive compensation involved in adding\nconversion damages to other remedies (including compensatory\ndamages) for copyright infringement, which led to the abolition of\nsuch conversion damages in 1988.59\nAs Borders did involve conversion of BALPC\u2019s actual books\nand not only the copyrighted interest, it might, indeed, readily be\ndistinguished from the situations normally envisaged by the 1988\nAct. But, as in Borders we are not really dealing with adjudication\nbut with judicial legislation, this legislation would have benefited\nfrom consideration of the position taken on damages for\nHudson (ed.), New Perspectives on Property Law: Obligations and Restitution (London 2003),\nch. 14 and D.

In\nthe opinion of this author, still by far the most profound contribution to the discussion of\ncopyright is A.

These damages are, as a matter\nof legislative history,60 intimately related to the present statutory\nprovision for damages in excess of the compensatory measure for\ninfringement of copyright. But there is no common law authority\nfor the award of exemplary damages for copyright infringement,\nand so these should be ruled out under the cause of action test in\nRookes v. Barnard.61 There also is no settled authority that\nexemplary damages can be awarded for infringement under the\nCopyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, section 97(2),62 and the\nleading work on the subject is of the opinion that they should not\nbe.63 It has also been held that normal compensatory damages\nunder section 96(2) of that Act, and \u2018\u2018additional\u2019\u2019 damages under\nsection 97(2), are available only in the alternative to the account of\nprofits effectively granted in Borders.64\nTo draw all this to an end, it is necessary to say only that the\nlevel of protection of copyright provided by the remedies regime\neven after all these things are taken into account is regarded by our\nleading intellectual property judges as already giving claimants\nexcessive rights,65 and that no-one who understands the issues can\nthink it an unambiguously good idea to grant remedies which\nwould move us towards making the intellectual property right really\nabsolute, for it is unarguable that the current formal system of\ncopyright is remotely tolerable only because its widespread\ninfringement is readily possible.66 Though what has been done in\nBorders fits the pattern in intellectual property cases of trying to\ncounter uncertainty of enforcement by the draconian quality of any\npunishment actually meted out, it certainly is not the case that even\nthose to whom the terror weapon of punishment of this nature has\nbeen extended are confident it will work.

We do\nnot want to say what should be done, for we do not know. Why\nthe Court of Appeal thinks it does know is not a function of its\nsuperior knowledge, for it made up its mind about what would be\njust in a way which was itself unembarrassed by any real\nunderstanding of the policy issues involved, or any real concern for\nthe proprieties of adjudication. For those wishing to mulct\ndefendants on this basis, it is extremely tempting to proceed on the\nclaimed authority of Blake, with the results of muddled law and ill-\njudged policy which are becoming all too familiar.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn Borders, the Court of Appeal has engaged in judicial legislation\nwhich is unwise because the court does not understand the problem\nfor which it is trying to legislate. This, however, is not the main\npoint which we wish to make. In all areas of policy formulation,\nnot merely the law, the possibility of error such as that perpetrated\nin this case emerges only because one gives up the restraints of\nrespect for previous wisdom and pursues abstract principle, in this\ncase \u2018\u2018justice,\u2019\u2019 whatever that means. Common law adjudication is\nmeant to guard against the possibility of radical error of this sort,\nbut Borders is yet more evidence that the first thing crushed in the\npassage of the restitutionary juggernaut set in motion by Blake is\nthe legal respect for previous wisdom institutionalised in the\ncommon law by precedent.\nOne looks in vain in Borders for an appreciation of the value of\nthe constraints imposed by precedent, even when one acknowledges\nthat this can play a positive role in appeal courts only when\nsophisticatedly combined with a further appreciation of what can\nbe done to move beyond those constraints whilst still respecting\nthem. As the Court of Appeal does not just simply say what it\nthinks is just and entirely ignore precedent, it would be wrong to\nsay that the court shows no feeling for common law adjudication\nwhatsoever. But the feeling it displays is vestigial. For, having\ndecided in advance that Jordan\u2019s case had no merits, the court does\nnot seek to be guided by authority but interprets the authority\ntendentiously, or ignores it, in order to realise an idea of justice\narrived at by some other means. In Borders, an ignorance of the\neconomic and legal policy issues raised by the case led the court to\n67 Hanks, note 4 above.\n224 The Cambridge Law Journal [2006]\nthe erroneous belief that justice requires that Jordan be most\nthoroughly mulcted. The nuanced balancing of the interests of the\nclaimant and the defendant which characterises the common law of\nremedies for breach of obligations, and which is not entirely absent\neven from the law of exemplary damages, which is the common law\nof obligations\u2019 poorest doctrine, is ironed out so that the law of\nremedies may better serve only the claimant\u2019s interests.\nThe result is bad law (adjudication) and bad policy ( judicial\nlegislation), and that one can say this in respect of even this\ndefendant tells us that something is going seriously wrong in the\ncourse of the process of improving the position of the claimant on\nthe claimed authority of Blake. Who knows but that, at the end of\nthis process, the common law of remedies may well appear so\nunnuanced, unbalanced and unfair that it may be thought to cry\nout for an improvement which it is believed can be supplied only\nby importing a respect for \u2018\u2018proportionality\u2019\u2019 derived from the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\nC.L.J.
