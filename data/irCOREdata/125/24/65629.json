However, better designed studies\nthat measure objective health outcomes are needed.\nWork has long been acknowledged as an important\nsocial determinant of health and health inequal-\nities.1\u20134 Employment, or lack of it, and its quality\nand type are vital in terms of income and social\nstatus in all advanced industrialised societies.\nHowever, the nature of work has altered consider-\nably over the past two decades, not least in terms\nof the cultivation of labour market practices in\nwhich skills, working hours, contracts, conditions,\npay and location are more flexible.5 6 Similarly, a\n24-hour society has started to emerge with\nassociated concerns about abnormal working hours\nand work-life balance (WLB).7\nIn this context, recent reports from the UK\nDepartment of Health and Department of Work\nand Pensions, the US Department of Health and\nHuman Services, and the World Health\nOrganization show that the workplace is increas-\ningly being considered by policymakers as an\nimportant intervention point at which health can\nbe improved and health inequalities reduced.4 8\u201311\nAttention to date has focused on the psychosocial\nwork environment, in particular psychological\ndemands and job control (individual decision\nauthority), as explored in depth in the Whitehall\nstudies.12\u201316 However, there is a largely untapped\nliterature on the effects of particular types of work\npatterning on health and health inequalities, and,\nin particular, there is a large body of evidence\nspanning several decades that describes the nega-\ntive effects of shift work on health and well-\nbeing.17 18\nReported health problems associated with shift\nwork include sleep disturbances, fatigue, digestive\nproblems, and stress-related illnesses, as well as\nincreases in general morbidity, and in sickness\nabsence.9 These health problems may derive from\ndisruption to physiological, psychological and social\ncircadian rhythms,17 18 as shift work, particularly\nthat involving night work, disrupts the natural\ncircadian rhythm, leading to disruption of sleep (as\nnatural alerting mechanisms such as the cortisol\nsurge and temperature rise will interrupt sleep) and\ndaytime functioning (wakefulness at night will be\nreduced by temperature drops and melatonin\nsurges). Sudden changes in schedule can, therefore,\nhave an effect akin to \u2018\u2018jet lag\u2019\u2019. Disruption to the\ncircadian rhythm can also lead to disharmony within\nthe body as some functions (e.g. heart rate) adapt\nmore quickly than others (typically endogenous\nfunctions such as body temperature, and melato-\nnin).18 This leads to desynchronisation, which itself\ncan result in psychological malaise, fatigue and\ngastrointestinal problems. Realignment can take\nseveral weeks.18 Most existing research emphasises\nthese physiological changes, but shift work also\ninvolves significant social desynchronisation, invol-\nving working at times and on days that may make it\ndifficult to maintain a balanced domestic and social\nlife work life balance (WLB).20 Literature also\nsuggests that cardiovascular problems such as\nhypertension and heart disease may be related to\nshift work.21 It has also been suggested that shift\nwork is associated with breast cancer, (possibly due\nto circadian disruption) and the birth of pre-term\n(premature) babies, but the current evidence base is\ninconclusive.22\u201325 Shift work may also involve\nincreased risk of injuries and accidents as perfor-\nmance fluctuates.26\nShift work may, therefore, be an important, but\nlargely overlooked determinant of health and\nwellbeing for many workers. The practice is\ncommon with one in five European workers\ninvolved in shift work,25 though the definition of\nthe term can be complex (the UK Labour Force\nSurvey for example identifies ten different cate-\ngories).27 Shift work is also socially patterned, being\nless common in graduates, and more common\namongst manual workers and those working in the\nmanufacturing or healthcare sectors.27\nReview\n764 J Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:764\u2013777. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.067249\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nChanges to the organisation of shift work have the potential\nto reduce these negative health effects and perhaps also have an\nimpact on social inequalities in health and wellbeing. A popular\norganisational level intervention is changing the hours of shift\nwork by introducing a Compressed Working Week (CWW). The\nCWW is an alternative work schedule in which the hours\nworked per day are increased, whilst the days worked are\ndecreased in order to work the standard number of weekly\nhours in less than five days.28 The CWW, therefore, represents a\nradical break from the 8-hour working day length favoured by\nworkers and trade unions.27 However, a cap still remains on the\nnumber of hours worked per week (a maximum of 48 hours\nunder the European Union Working Time Directive).27 The\nmost popular forms of CWW are the 12-hour CWW, the 10-\nhour CWW and the Ottawa system.18 The 12-hour CWW\ninvolves four 12-hour shifts (day, night) over four days with\nthree or four days off. Under a 10-hour CWW, four 10-hour\nshifts are worked followed by three days off. The Ottawa\nsystem consists of three or four 10-hour morning or afternoon\nshifts spread over four days, then two days off. This is followed\nby a block of seven eight-hour nights, then six days off.\nIn this paper, we present the results of the first systematic\nreview of primary empirical studies on the health and WLB\neffects of changes to the organisation and experience of shift\nwork brought about by CWW interventions, and any differ-\nential impacts by social group. Although previous literature\nreviews of the CWW exist, these concentrate on observational\nepidemiological (descriptive or comparative) studies rather than\nevaluative intervention studies, and have not been conducted\nusing full systematic review methodology.719 29\nMETHODS\nInclusion and exclusion\nWe sought to identify all empirical studies (both prospective\nand retrospective, with or without control groups) that\nexamined the effects of CWW interventions on the health and\nWLB of shift workers and their families. For the purposes of the\nreview, shift work was defined as \u2018\u2018any regularly taken\nemployment outside the hours of 07:00 and 18:00\u2019\u2019.18\nInterventions had to be implemented in actual workplaces, so\nnon-workplace laboratory-based studies were excluded. Health-\nrelated outcomes included specific diseases, as well as more\ngeneral measures of physical or psychological health and\nwellbeing. Sickness absence, health behaviours and injuries\nresulting from workplace accidents were included, as were\nphysiological measures, and measures of physical and mental\nwellbeing such as tiredness, fatigue and sleep.22 The social\nimpacts of the interventions, specifically on WLB were also\nexamined. Organisational effects (eg job satisfaction, individual\nor organisational performance), when reported alongside the\nprimary outcomes (health and WLB), were also recorded to help\nin understanding the motivations behind the CWW interven-\ntions, and also their viability. Impacts on inequalities in health\nwere considered as outcomes.\nSearch strategy\nWe searched 27 electronic databases and websites for docu-\nments of any type, from any country, at any time and in any\nlanguage. Details of the databases searched and an example\nsearch for MEDLINE are detailed in boxes 1 and 2. The full\nsearch strategy is available online (Appendix 1). We also\nsearched bibliographies and reference lists.\nData extraction\nWe located 13 308 titles, of which 419 were examined in more\ndetail, and of these 88 were retrieved for full-paper analysis.\nThe lead reviewer (CB) excluded obviously irrelevant titles and\nabstracts from the initial literature search, and retrieved full-\ntext copies of the remainder. Studies making any reference to\nhealth or wellbeing were independently appraised by two\nreviewers (CB and MP), who re-examined papers jointly to\nresolve disagreements. We included percentages, confidence\nintervals (CI), p values, and effect sizes when they were\nreported in the original study, or calculated these statistics\n(using final sample sizes) if sufficient information was\navailable (although lack of data was a problem in some\nstudies).\nCritical appraisal\nCritical appraisal criteria were adapted from existing systematic\nreviews of the health effects of employment interventions and,\nguidance for the evaluation of non-randomised studies (box\n3).30\u201332 Two reviewers (CB and MP) independently appraised the\nincluded studies according to these criteria.33 The critical\nappraisal criteria were used for descriptive purposes only and\nto highlight variations in the quality of studies (see tables 1\u20133).\nNo quality score was calculated.\nThese criteria were used to appraise all of the included\nstudies. The results of this process are presented under the\ncritical appraisal section of the results in tables 1\u20133, with the\nBox 1 Databases and websites\nThe following 27 databases and websites were searched from\nstart date to November 2005:\nc ASSIA (CSA)\nc EU Community Research & Development Information Service\nc Dissertation Abstracts\nc Eric (CSA)\nc European Commission Libraries Catalogue\nc Econlit (Webspirs)\nc Electronic Collections Online (FirstSearch)\nc Embase (Ovid)\nc Geobase (FirstSearch)\nc Harvard Business Review\nc HMIC (OVID)\nc Index to Theses\nc International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (OVID)\nc JSTOR\nc Labordoc\nc Management Contents (Dialog)\nc Medline (Ovid)\nc Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OVID)\nc NTIS\nc PAIS (Webspirs)\nc PapersFirst (FirstSearch)\nc PsycINFO (Ovid)\nc REGARD (ESRC)\nc Research Papers in Economics\nc Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science)\nc Sigle (Webspirs)\nc Sociological Abstracts (CSA)\nReview\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:764\u2013777. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.067249 765\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nnumbers 1\u201310 representing satisfactory fulfilment of the\ncorresponding criterion.\nRESULTS\nForty studies examined the effects of CWW interventions on\nthe health and WLB of shift workers.34\u201383 The majority of CWW\nstudies examined changes to four days of 12-hour shifts,\nalthough four examined changes to 10-hour shifts,34 35 56\u201359 61\nand two examined the introduction of the Ottawa shift\nsystem.37 78 Twenty-three of the studies were prospective\ncohorts,34\u201361 of which five were controlled.34\u201339 In this paper,\nwe focus our detailed comments on the results of these better-\ndesigned studies (that is, the prospective cohorts with control\ngroups), although the overall synthesis reflects the results of all\n40 studies. Most of the CWW studies were based in one of four\ndistinct occupational settings: healthcare organisations (9), the\npolice force (8), manufacturing companies (11) or energy\nindustries (9). No studies were found relating to other key\nshift-working occupations, such as retail or entertainment.26\nThe majority of health outcomes, and all WLB ones, were self-\nreported. In a sizeable number of the CWW studies, the\nintervention was either at the behest of the work force,34\u2013\n36 41 47 49 60 69 70 83 or from the management (with a stated desire\nto improve health or WLB).37 50 62\u201364 66 71 74 79 80 82 However, in\nother studies, the motivation was more obviously efficiency or\nproductivity.46 48 51 53 54 59 61 67 77 78 81 Results are summarised by\nstudy design in tables 1\u20133 and detailed results are available\nonline (Appendix 2).\nHealth-related outcomes\nThe effects of the CWW interventions on health outcomes\nwere not conclusive: a number of studies reported some\nimprovements in workforce health,34\u201338 42\u201345 47\u201350 52 54 56\u201360 62\u2013\n65 67 68 72\u201374 78\u201383 whilst others found no change,39 40 46 53 55 66 69\u2013\n71 75 76 77 and two found only negative effects.41 51\nThe five prospective cohort studies with control groups34\u201339\nfound that there were no detrimental effects on self-reported\nhealth-related outcomes after the introduction of CWW\n(table 1), and in four of the studies some improvements were\nrecorded.34\u201338 In one Canadian study of 30 police officers,34 35\nself-reported health behaviour in the form of sporting activities\nimproved in the intervention group compared with the control\ngroup (intervention mean 8.1 to 13.9, comparison mean 7.9 to\n7.0, F = 8.8, p,0.01), but sickness absence rates did not change\nsignificantly. In another study of 70 UK police officers,37 all but\none (sleep quality) of the self-reported health indicators\nimproved significantly in the intervention group (e.g. for the\nGeneral Health Questionnaire scores, the intervention mean\nimproved from 11.2 to 7.1, whereas the comparison mean\nworsened from 11.0 to 11.9, F = 15.56, p,0.001). However, our\ncritical appraisal of this study identified notable differences in\nhealth at baseline between the control and intervention groups:\nthe intervention group had a better baseline score than the\ncontrol group, thereby possibly leading to an exaggerated\nintervention effect.\nIn a Swedish study of 46 chemical plant workers,38 self-\nreported sleep quality was generally better in the intervention\nBox 2 Example search strategy (MEDLINE)\n1. shiftwork$.ti,ab.\n2. nightwork$.ti,ab.\n3.

This study was not notably different\nfrom the others in terms of methodological quality.\nAlthough these studies were robust in terms of study design\n(employing control groups), the sample sizes were small,\nranging from 23 to 85, and the lengths of follow-up were\nrelatively short. No study followed up respondents for at least a\nyear, which may be the optimum as it allows for the possibility\nof controlling for possible seasonal effects. It should also be\nnoted that three of the five controlled prospective studies were\nconducted in the police force and so care is needed in\ngeneralising from these results to other occupational groups\ninvolved in shift work.\nThe uncontrolled prospective studies (table 2) were also\ninconclusive, as, whilst the majority identified an improvement\nin one or another of the various health outcomes measured,\nthey found little effect for other health outcomes.43\u201345 49 50 52 54\n56\u201359 62\u201365 67 68 Amongst the five largest studies (sample sizes\n.100),49 51 59\u201361, two reported mixed health effects,49 59 two\nreported health improvements60 61 and one recorded a negative\nhealth effect.51 Williams\u2019 study of 131 male chemical plant\nworkers49 recorded an improvement in self-reported depression\n(decreased from 2.43 to 2.12, t = 2.32, p,0.05), but found no\nchange in absence and injury rates.49 Similarly, a study of\nCanadian mine workers59 found that after the introduction of\nCWW, sleep (mean difference =20.3, t = 2.43, p,0.01) and\ntiredness (mean difference = 0.9; t = 4.77, p,0.001) worsened\non the day shift whilst gastrointestinal problems (mean\ndifference =20.4, t = 2.35, p,0.01) and headaches (mean\ndifference =20.3, t = 2.07, p = 0.03) improved. Two studies of\nAmerican production workers60 61 reported various improve-\nments in self-reported health, including a decrease in the\nprevalence of common shift-related health disorders (such as\nheartburn, acid stomach and diarrhoea) from 43.8% to 27%\n(p,0.001)59 and a decrease in sickness absence (eg from 11.39 to\n4.69 days).61 However, in a study of 150 UK nurses,51\ndissatisfaction with levels of mental (0.8 (0.53 to 1.07)) and\nphysical (0.7 (0.50 to 0.90)) fatigue increased.\nA number of smaller studies of varying methodological\nquality and sample size reported no changes in any of the\nhealth indicators.40 46 53 55 66 Other studies were more conclusive,\nfinding significant improvements in sleep duration,42 absence,47\nphysiological distress, fatigue and stress,48 sleep between shifts,\nsleep difficulties, and health disorders.60 In all these stu-\ndies,42 47 48 60 employees were either involved in the design and\nimplementation of the intervention or they were supportive of\nthe change. Importantly, only two studies, both based in\nhealthcare settings, found that all the self-reported measures of\nhealth worsened after the introduction of the CWW.41 51\nOverall, the prospective studies were rather limited in terms\nof length of follow-up and sample size: only three studies had\nlengths of follow-up of 12 months or more, and the studies were\nsmall (tending to involve 15 to 50 participants).\nThe pattern was similar for the retrospective studies (table 3),\nwith only a minority reporting any significant intervention\neffect (table 3).72\u201374 78\u201383 The majority of the significant effects,\nthough, were positive, particularly in terms of self-reported\ngeneral health and morbidity;72 73 78 headaches, gastric upset,\ndiarrhoea, and alcohol problems;72 73 sleep;74 and injuries.79\u201381 83\nThese retrospective studies were generally of low quality; all\nhad sample sizes,100; and low response rates. However, one of\nthe larger and better-quality retrospective studies,72 73 with a\nsample of 247, a response rate .60% and adjustment for\ndemographic confounders, reported a significant decrease in the\nage-standardised morbidity ratio amongst men from 1.02 (95%\nCI 1.00 to 1.05) to 0.47 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.48), but a non-\nsignificant decrease in women from 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.82)\nto 0.67 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.71).\nFatigue\nShift work is often associated with fatigue18 20 26 and it might be\nexpected that CWW, due to the longer working day, the\npotential for moonlighting, or excessive overtime, might further\nincrease problems of fatigue amongst shift workers. However,\nof the 18 intervention studies covered in this review that\nmeasured fatigue or tiredness, in only four was there an adverse\nchange in fatigue levels after the introduction of CWW.41 51 59 67\nThree studies recorded improvements,42 53 59 and in the other\neleven there was no intervention effect.41 43\u201345 51 69 72 75 80 81 86 The\nintroduction of longer working days under CWW does not,\ntherefore, appear to adversely affect fatigue; however, this may\nwell be because of the extended rest period, which means\nthat the normal weekly working hours are not exceeded in a\nseven-day period.28 However, it may also be due to the\npopularity of CWW interventions amongst workers (as they\nincrease leisure time and\/or enable moonlighting)39, and this\nmay bias the findings of evaluations in a positive direction,\nespecially in studies with a short follow-up period.\nSubsequently, it is important that employee safeguards such\nas the EU Working Time Directive or other measures that limit\novertime and moonlighting are incorporated into CWW\nschedules.\nWork-life balance\nThe majority of studies that examined WLB out-\ncomes noted improvements after the introduction of\nCWW,34 35 37 38 40 46 48 49 53 54 62\u201365 68 74 77 78 82 with only a few report-\ning no intervention effect36 39 47 50 or a worsening in WLB.43\u201345 51 54\nHowever, CWW are often popular amongst shift workers,\nlargely because they value the additional days off that are\nafforded by the CWW model.84 Indeed, in 22 of the CWW\nstudies, the intervention was either specifically requested by the\nemployees,38\u201340 45 51 53 64 73 74 87 or implemented with their sup-\nport.48 54\u201359 61 65 67 71 74 78\u201381 Similarly, the ability of an individual\nworker to adapt the new schedule to his\/her needs may have\ninfluenced findings.\nThree of the five prospective cohort studies with control groups\n(table 1) recorded significant improvements in self-reported WLB\namongst the intervention group compared with the control\ngroup.34 35 37 38 In the Barton-Cunningham study of 30 Canadian\npolice officers,34 35 all four of the indicators of wellbeing used in the\nstudy were significantly improved in the intervention group (eg\ntime spent on domestic chores improved in the intervention group\nfrom a mean of 7.8 to 16.0, whereas the comparison mean\nworsened from 8.6 to 6.5, F = 14.7, p,0.01). These improvements\nall disappeared when the old eight-hour schedule was restored.34 35\nSimilarly, in the Totterdell and Smith study of 70 UK police\nofficers37 all WLB indicators were improved in the intervention\ngroup (for example, a reduction was recorded in the intervention\ngroup for \u2018\u2018insufficient time for family\u2019\u2019, intervention mean 56.4\nto 15.5, comparison mean 63.8 to 62.6, F = 41.61, p,0.001).\nHowever, there were significant differences between the inter-\nvention and control groups at baseline, which suggests that the\nfindings need to be replicated in larger studies with well-matched\ncontrol groups.\nReview\n768 J Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:764\u2013777. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.067249\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nTable

Similarly, the study of 85 mine\nworkers36 found no differences between the intervention and\ncontrol groups for family satisfaction. Importantly though,\nnone of the prospective cohort studies with control groups\nidentified a decrease in WLB after the implementation of the\nCWW interventions. As noted above, these studies tended to\nemploy relatively short periods of follow-up and small samples,\nand so, despite the controlled design, the evidence they present\nis suggestive rather than convincing.\nConsistently, the prospective uncontrolled studies (table 2),\nincluding two of the studies with at least 12 months follow-up,\nfound that aspects of WLB improved after the introduction of\nCWW interventions.40 46 48 49 54 62\u201365 68 WLB indicators (such as\ntime available for recreation, time spent with family, or conflict\nbetween work and non-work time) improved in eight\nstudies.40 46 48 49 54 62\u201365 68 Some smaller and less methodologically\nrobust studies (e.g. low response and follow-up rates) did not\nidentify any changes in WLB as a result of the intervention.47 50\nOnly three studies,43\u201345 51 54 of which all but one51 were revealed\nby our critical appraisal process to be of questionable\nmethodological quality (small sample size, low response and\nfollow-up rates, etc), reported any decreases in WLB and in two\nof these less robust studies only one or two aspects of WLB\ndeclined whilst others improved54 or were unaffected.43\u201345\nIn all of the retrospective studies that measured the effects of\nCWW interventions on WLB, it was found to improve.74 77 78 82\nFor example, improvements were reported in leisure time and\ntime spent with partner,74 quality of life77 and family life,78 and\nchild care.82 However, the critical appraisal process suggested\nthat these studies had some methodological problems particu-\nlarly in terms of low baseline response rates,77 78 low or no\nfollow-up response rates,74 77 78 82 and little adjustment for non-\nresponders or confounders.74 77 78 82\nHealth and work-life balance\nThe results of the CWW studies suggest a link between\nimproved WLB and improved health. Three of the prospective\nstudies with control groups,34 35 37 38 six of the prospective\nstudies without a control group48 49 54 62\u201365 68 and three of the\nretrospective studies reporting increases in WLB,74 78 82 also\nreported improvements in health, particularly mental health.\nChanges in WLB were less likely to be accompanied by changes\nin measures of physical health. For example, in five studies,36 43\u2013\n45 47 50 health improvements occurred despite no accompanying\nchanges in WLB. This tentatively suggests that whilst changes\nin mental or physical health and WLB can clearly occur\nseparately, positive changes in WLB can translate into positive\nmental health effects. The relationship between WLB and\nphysical health, however, is less clear. Of course, this finding\nmay reflect the self-reported nature of the health and WLB\noutcomes. However, this link and possible causal pathway\nshould be examined further in future prospective studies.\nOrganisational outcomes\nGenerally, the studies suggested that the organisational effects\nof the CWW were small or absent with most studies finding no\nevidence of either benefit or detriment.34\u201337 42 47 49 52 54 65 66 68 78\nThree of the prospective cohort studies with control groups\n(table 1) measured effects on performance (job satisfaction or\nTable 3 Continued\nStudy\nDesign and critical appraisal\n(see criteria in box 3) Setting and participants\nSummary results\nq = improvement Q = worsening\n\u00ab = little change\nBaker et al, 200081 Historical data: nine-month pre-average,\n12- and 24-month post-averages\nFinal sample: not stated\nCritical appraisal: 2 4 5 7 10\nCoal Mine, Australia\nMiners, maintenance workers, preparation plant\nworkers\nEight-hour shifts to A: four 12-hour shifts,\ntwo\/six days off; then from A to B: as\nsystem A with addition of three consecutive night\nshifts and no cap on overtime\nAbsence\nInjury incident rate\nQ\nq\nBloodworth et al, 200182 After only recall data\nHistorical data: two-month pre-average,\ntwo-month post-average\nFinal sample: 16\nCritical appraisal: 2 4\nHospital, UK\nNurses, all female\nFive 7.5-hour shifts, two days off to two\n6.25-hour shifts, two 12-hour shifts, three\ndays off\nTiredness\nAbsence\nChild care\nPerformance\nStaff costs\nErrors and incidents\n\u00ab\nq\nq\n\u00ab\nq\n\u00ab\nRetrospective repeat cross-section studies\nBrinton, 198383 Historical data: five-month pre-average,\nfive-month post-average\nFinal sample: 76\nCritical appraisal: 2 4 5 9\nPaper Mill, USA\nWood yard workers, all male\nFive eight-hour shifts, two days off to four\n12-hour shifts, three\/four days off\nInjury frequency rate\nAbsence\nq\nq\nEffect sizes have been added to the text where appropriate and the detailed results are available in online table E3.\n*This study also used qualitative focus groups.\nBox 3 Critical appraisal criteria30\u201332\n1.

Similarly, in\nthe other prospective cohort studies (table 2) the majority of the\nsixteen that measured organisational outcomes found no\neffect,42 47 49 52 54 65 66 68 whilst several reported improvements; in\nmorale,53 62\u201364 job satisfaction,61 48 60 productivity and quality60 or\norganisational effectiveness.48 However, four studies reported\nadverse organisational effects such as an increase in turnover,41\ndecreased job satisfaction51 or decreased performance.59 67\nAmongst the five retrospective studies that had organisational\noutcomes,76\u201380 82 four identified benefits in terms of reduced staff\ncosts and errors,79 80 82 productivity,77 or morale.78 Overall, the\nbalance of best evidence suggests that there were few positive or\nnegative organisational effects, though it is possible that\nnegative findings in this area may not have been published or\nmay otherwise be unavailable (for example, for reasons of\ncommercial confidentiality).\nDISCUSSION\nOverall, the evidence base on the health effects of CWW\ninterventions is perhaps best described as cautiously positive:\npositive because whilst the CWW interventions might not\nalways improve the self-reported health of shift workers, they\nare seldom detrimental (indeed, the five prospective cohorts\nwith control groups found no detrimental effects on health);\nand cautious because of the methodological quality of the\ncurrent evidence base (box 4). In contrast, the evidence on the\neffects of CWW interventions on the WLB of shift workers\nseems more conclusive (although the comments about metho-\ndological quality still apply): the CWW improves WLB.\nResearch implications\nThe evidence base on changing the organisation of shift work by\nintroducing the CWW is relatively large by systematic review\nstandards, both in terms of the intervention studies covered in\nthis research report (40 in total), and the wider descriptive\nepidemiological literature.29 However, there are still some large\nevidence gaps, most notably in terms of any effects of shift\nwork interventions on inequalities in health amongst working-\nage populations. The majority of studies were conducted in\nfairly homogeneous populations (eg police officers, male\nproduction workers, or female nurses) and, perhaps in part\ndue to this, only one study differentiated outcomes by\ngender,72 73 and none of the studies differentiated by occupa-\ntional grade or socio-economic group.\nA key question remains of whether changing the organisation\nof shift work by introducing CWW has the potential to decrease\nhealth inequalities amongst the working-age population. An\nimportant consideration in this respect is the social patterning\nof shift work in the UK, which tends to be concentrated\namongst workers from lower socio-economic groups (with the\nnotable exceptions of medical and emergency services staff).27\nThis contributes to the generally poorer, more health-damaging\nwork environment experienced by manual compared with non-\nmanual workers. It is plausible that CWW interventions that\nimprove the health of shift workers may, therefore, on the\nwhole, help to reduce the gap in health between manual and\nnon-manual workers caused by the differences in working\nconditions between the two groups. This possibility should be\nexplored further.\nThere is also little evidence on the effects of CWW on the\nhealth behaviours of shift workers. Only four of the 40 studies\nin this review examined health behaviours. Two studies\nreported on the effects on exercise with one reporting an\nincrease,34 35 whilst the other found no change;50 one study\nreported an increase in alcohol consumption,68 and another\nfound no intervention effect on the consumption of social\nBox 4 Methodological limitations\nAlthough the 40 studies reviewed represent the best available\nevidence on the health and work-life balance effects of\nCompressed Working Week (CWW) interventions, they\nwere subject to a number of methodological and other\nlimitations.\nc No trials and only five prospective cohort studies with a\ncontrol group were located. The control groups were not\nmatched or randomised, and in at least one case there were\nsignificant differences in health at baseline between the\nintervention and control groups.37\nc We elected to include all studies regardless of sample size.\nHowever, it needs to be noted that a number of studies were\nbased on such small final sample sizes that their research\nvalue is limited. For example, nine studies50 52\u201358 68 79 80 82 had\nfinal sample sizes of 20 or fewer, and there was one study\nwith only three participants.55 Therefore, in our synthesis, we\nhave highlighted the larger studies.\nc Studies were often conducted in homogeneous populations.\nFor example, three of the five controlled prospective cohorts\nwere conducted amongst police officers.34 35 37 39 The\ngeneralisablity of the results to other occupations is, therefore,\nlimited.\nc The number of small studies also raises the possibility that any\npositive findings may be due to publication bias, in which\nsmall studies with positive findings are more likely to be\npublished (or are otherwise more easily located by reviewers)\nthan those with negative findings. Similarly, bias may have\narisen as we were only able to locate studies in the public\ndomain, thus excluding the majority of commercial studies.\nc The health, work-life balance and organisational measures\nwere usually self-reported and they varied greatly from study\nto study. Bias may, therefore, have occurred, as employees\nwere aware of the intervention and in some cases highly\ninvolved in its design and implementation. There was a\ndearth of well-validated questionnaires, such as the General\nHealth Questionnaire37 39 52 65 68 or the Standard Shift Work\nIndex.39\nc The study follow-ups were generally 12 months or less34\u201355\n59 62 74 76\u201380 82 and so it was not possible to analyse the longer\nterm health or work-life balance effects of the CWW\ninterventions, which may be particularly important in terms of\naccumulated fatigue and physical health. The short follow-ups\nmay also account for the lack of a health effect (either positive\nor negative) in the majority of the studies.\nc There was also a lack of information provided in some studies\nabout the background38\u201340 42\u201345 52 55\u201358 65 68 72 73 75 76 to the\ninterventions or how they had been implemented.34\u201346 48\n50\u201353 55\u201359 61\u201368 71\u201373 75\u201379 82 In those studies that reported\nbackground details, those in which the intervention was\ninstigated by employees or the motivation was employee\nwellbeing,34\u201337 41 47 49 50 60 62\u201364 66 69\u201371 74 79 80 82 83 tended to have\nmore positive health and work-life balance effects, whilst the\neffects of those that were the most overtly driven by economic\nmotives were often negative or negligible.46 51 53 54 59 61 67 77\nReview\n774 J Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:764\u2013777. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.067249\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \ndrugs.52 Furthermore, there were only two studies on the\nOttawa CWW system,37 78 and so the effects of particular CWW\nsystems is another area that could be examined in future\nresearch.\nIn addition, the research studies reviewed were subject to a\nnumber of methodological limitations (see box 4) such as\ninadequate control groups, lack of detail about implementa-\ntion, small sample sizes and short follow-ups. Perhaps most\nimportantly, the majority of outcomes were self-reported and\nthis may have led to confounding, particularly in terms of\nwhether employees were supportive or unsupportive of the\nimposed intervention. Therefore, in the future, prospective,\nwell-controlled studies, which measure objective health out-\ncomes, and which describe the background to the study and\nthe implementation of the intervention, are needed.85 Studies\nthat examine the mental health effects of CWW interventions\nand any interaction with changes in WLB would be the most\nuseful.\nPolicy implications\nThe existing evidence, albeit somewhat methodologically\nlimited, suggests that introducing the CWW may enhance the\nWLB of shift workers. There is also evidence to suggest that it is\nnot detrimental to self-reported health in the short term.\nImportantly, CWW interventions tend to have either positive or\nnegligible organisational effects and so employee health and\nWLB may be improved through the workplace without\ndamaging company productivity or competitiveness. This\nmessage may be a useful aid in implementing the recent cross-\ndepartmental Health and Safety Executive, Department of\nHealth and Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 \u2018\u2018Health, Work\nand Wellbeing\u2019\u2019 strategy86 amongst employers. Changing shift\nwork organisation and working practices to make them more\nconducive to a WLB does not necessarily need a warning caveat\nabout the dangers to productivity or competitiveness.\nAcknowledgements: The work in this paper was undertaken by the Centre for Public\nPolicy and Health (University of Durham), the MRC Public and Social Health Sciences\nUnit (Glasgow), the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (University of York), and the\nDepartment of Public Health (University of Liverpool) as part of the work of the Public\nHealth Research Consortium (PHRC).

It does not appear to be detrimental to self-reported\nhealth in the short term.\nc Importantly, Compressed Working Week interventions tend to\nhave either positive or negligible organisational effects and so\nhealth and wellbeing may be improved through the workplace\nwithout damaging productivity or competitiveness.\nc The Compressed Working Week could, therefore, be an\nimportant tool for both policymakers and employers in terms\nof promoting healthier work places and improving working\npractices.\nWhat is already known on this subject\nc A large number of observational studies suggest that shift\nwork negatively effects employee health and work-life\nbalance.\nc Shift work is common: one in five European workers are\ninvolved in some form of shift work.\nc Shift work is socially patterned \u2013 less common amongst\ngraduates and more common amongst manual workers.\nc One hypothesis is that organisational level interventions such\nas the Compressed Working Week may be effective in\nreducing these negative health effects and perhaps also\nimpact upon social inequalities in health and work-life balance.\nWhat this study adds\nc This is the first study to systematically review 40 intervention\nstudies of the effects on the health and work-life balance of\nshift workers of Compressed Working Week interventions.\nc The methodologically limited evidence base suggests that the\nCompressed Working Week appears to improve the work-life\nbalance of shift workers, and that it appears to do so with little\nor no adverse health or organisational effects.\nc It is unclear what the effects are on health inequalities,\nalthough as shift work is concentrated amongst lower\noccupational groups it is plausible that effective Compressed\nWorking Week interventions could help reduce the health gap\nbetween manual and non-manual workers.\nReview\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:764\u2013777. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.067249 775\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \n14.
