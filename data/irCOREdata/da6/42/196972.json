In \nrecent years, political marketing academics have called for a theoretical and empirical revaluation \nof political marketing theory and its underlying economic assumptions and ideological \ncomponents (see for example Savigny, 2008; Wring and Savigny, 2008).  This paper seeks to \ncontribute to the debate by considering some limitations of political marketing research and by \nengaging actively with critical theories and methods which hold promise for future research in \nthis exciting area.   \n \nPolitical marketing may be characterized as the application of marketing concepts to the study of \na strategic process involving voters and politicians (and their parties).  Henneberg  notes, for \ninstance, that political marketers use marketing theory to account for the \u201cstrategies and \ninstruments\u201d (2001, p. 94) used by politicians, parties and the political machinery and that, \ntherefore, current political marketing literature has, for the most part, taken an \u2018instrumental\u2019 \napproach to marketing phenomena, i.e., by focusing on practical, rather than methodological or \nphilosophical, issues, such as election campaigning, polls, and political communications among \nothers (e.g. Lees-Marshment, 2001a and 2001b; 2002; Kotler and Kotler, 1999; O\u2019Cass, 1996; \nO\u2019Shaughnessy, 1996, 1990; Newman, 1994; Sabato, 1981). Political marketing, as a new sub-\ndiscipline, has sought legitimacy for its theoretical basis by borrowing from conventional \nmarketing concepts such as \u2018marketing orientation\u2019 (Narver and Slater, 1990; Kohli and Jaworski, \n4 \n \n1990), the \u2018exchange characteristics\u2019 of the political market (Egan, 1999; Collins and Butler, \n2002) or the \u2018service-dominant\u2019 paradigm in marketing (Vargo and Lusch, 2004). As Henneberg \nand O'Shaughnessy observe, quite rightly, its \u201chistorical development out of marketing theory \nprovides the ontological rationale for political marketing\u201d (2007, p. 9). \n \nAlthough we agree in principle with the idea that party politics and its machinations are highly \nsignificant in political marketing research because \u201c(p)olitical marketing is about the making and \nunmaking of governments in a democracy\u201d (O\u2019Shaughnessy and Henneberg, 2001, p. xiv), there \nare growing concerns among scholars that theories of political marketing are \u201cunderimagined\u201d, to \nborrow Brownlie\u2019s phrase. In particular, political marketing scholars continue to wrestle with the \nnarrowly pragmatic nature of much of the research conducted by their peers and colleagues.  The \nsame scholars who have successfully promulgated \u2018mainstream\u2019 theories of political marketing \nrecognise that the sub-discipline now needs to advance beyond the 'marketing concept' by re-\nexamining its epistemological assumptions, embracing pluralism and multidisciplinarity, and \ndrawing upon alternative marketing theories (Henneberg, 2007; Henneberg and O' Shaughnessy, \n2007).  However, much work remains to be done to explicate such a vision. \n \nThis paper investigates the likely sources and implications of a more critical orientation in \npolitical marketing research.  In doing so, we hope to map out a vision for the future of political \nmarketing rather than a set of tools or methods as such.  The aim is to articulate a political \nmarketing agenda which goes beyond the traditional confines of mainstream marketing and \npolitical science for inspiration and growth.  That is to say, if we are seeking a more thoughtful \nagenda for a critical theory of political marketing, then what are some possible intellectual \nsources we can draw upon?   \n \n5 \n \nThe paper is structured as follows. Following this introduction, the second section identifies key \nstrands in the debates between mainstream political marketing literature and emerging ideas on \nthe intersections between business and politics (see Baines and Egan, 2001; Harris, 2001; Butler \nand Collins, 1994; Niffenegger, 1989).  The third section focuses on the foundations (and, by \nimplication, the rationale) for a critical research agenda. In this context, we examine the \narguments of \u2018critical marketing\u2019 (Saren et al., 2007; Brownlie, 2006; Brownlie et al, 1999; \nMorgan, 1992; Brownlie and Saren, 1995) which are not only salient to, but underexplored in, in \npolitical marketing research.  In Section Four, we identify a range of critical social theories \n(including theories of production and consumption and the Critical Theory of the Frankfurt \nSchool) which have not, to date, been comprehensively included in the political marketing \ndomain. This section explains their relevance and their applicability of various critical theories to \npolitical phenomena and alludes to the way in which such an agenda changes both the tone and \ncontent of the political marketing agenda. Finally, we discuss the implications of a critical \napproach to political marketing and conclude with future directions for research. \n \n2. THE NATURE OF POLITICAL MARKETING: CURRENT DEBATES \n \nAccording to Wring (1997), the term \u2018political marketing\u2019 was first coined by Kelley (1956) in \nhis study on the increasing influence of professional persuaders in politics. For Kelley (1956), \n\u2018marketing\u2019 essentially meant \u2018persuasion\u2019 and was an update of a theme familiar since the First \nWorld War, as a new instrument of social control. However, the use of the marketing discourse \nalso reflects the view that professionals from the commercial marketing industry, especially \nmarketing, were increasingly involved in political persuasion (Scammell, 1999). \n \n6 \n \nThe gradual, but inexorable, intrusion of a corporate mindset into political marketing is hardly \nnew, but is only now being critically acknowledged as a source of conceptual \u2018contamination\u2019 by \nscholars. In this sense, political marketing resembles what Kotler and Andreassen (1991, p. 42) \nhave called the \u201cmindset of consumer-centeredness\u201d (in O\u2019Cass, 1996) inside the organisation. \nThe many analogies between consumer marketing and political marketing have clearly been \nexploited by researchers (see among others Egan, 1999; O\u2019Cass, 1996; Niffenegger, 1989; \nO\u2019Leary and Iredale, 1976; Kotler, 1975; Shama, 1973). Applied to political processes, \ncommercial marketing becomes \u2018political marketing\u2019, i.e. the application of business practices to \npolitics and the mindset of \u2018voter-centredness\u2019.  Lees-Marshment (2001) adopts a similar view by \narguing that political marketing is about political organisations adapting business-marketing \nconcepts and techniques. Harris (2003) notes the adoption of electoral campaigning techniques in \nbusiness, for influencing and gaining strategic corporate advantage. Similarly, Andrew (1996) \nnotes the direct relevance of political marketing techniques to business lobbying. As such, \nlobbying -- already an established tool of modern political communication -- and campaigning by \npressure groups are viewed as part of modern marketing (Harris and Lock, 2001; Harris, 2003).  \nOver the last decade and more, analyses of pressure group and political lobbying, public affairs \nand public relations (e.g. Andrew, 1996; Harris and Lock, 2001; Harris, 2003) have risen to the \ntop of the political marketing research agenda; as such, they form an integral part of \ncontemporary agendas for political marketing research and will be discussed in more detail later \nin the paper. \n \nAt the same time, there are many dissident voices in the debate of the \u2018appropriateness\u2019 of \nmarketing in politics. O'Shaughnessy (2001) considers political marketing and commercial \nmarketing as separate \u201cecologies\u201d (p. 1057). He argues that marketing is primarily a business \ndiscipline and, as such, warns against making the assumption that \u201cpolitical contexts are \n7 \n \ninvariably analogous to business to the extent that methods can be important and used with equal \neffect\u201d (O'Shaughnessy, 2001, p. 1047). Similarly, Lock and Harris argue that the parallels \nbetween political marketing and mainstream marketing are superficial, even though \u201cmarketing \nperspectives and analytical methods clearly have considerable applicability\u201d (Lock and Harris, \n1996, p. 23) and consequently political marketing, as a separate discipline, needs to develop its \nown paradigms and vocabulary (Lock and Harris, 1996). Savigny (2008, p.5) even argues that on \nan idealistic level marketing and politics are actually mutually exclusive categories and therefore \nboth ontologically and analytically distinct. She does, however, acknowledge that on a more \npractical level this needs to be reconciled with our neoliberal contemporary politics which \nprivileges markets and, more specifically, the practicalities of election campaigning in a \ntechnologically dense, media-centred environment (Savigny, 2008). \n \nThe debates outlined in this section point towards a more radical edge in political marketing \nresearch which is emerging today. We wish to extend the vision much further by drawing \nattention to critical theories which have been used by scholars in a number of other disciplines as \nwell as empirical methods which highlight the discursive and symbolic realities of 'political' \nphenomena (see for example Weaver et al., 2004). Weaver et al. (2004, 2006) for example, use \ncritical theory to show how propaganda and public relations can be understood as discourse \npractices utilised to legitimate social, political and\/or economic power and the public interest. For \npolitical marketing to mature as a truly interdisciplinary subject (e.g., Hunt, 1983), we advocate \nnot only the application of marketing tools and concepts to politics, but also a deeper engagement \nwith a comprehensive range of social theories which illuminate post-industrial consumer \nsocieties.  The willingness and ability of scholars and practitioners to develop such an \nengagement is vital to a 'critical' research agenda for political marketing. \n8 \n \n3.   CRITICAL AND POLITICAL MARKETING: FRAMING THE ISSUES   \n \nThe arguments of \u2018critical marketing\u2019 (Bradshaw and Firat, 2008; Tadajewski and Brownlie, \n2008; Saren et al., 2007; Brownlie, 2006; Brownlie et al, 1999; Morgan, 1992; Brownlie and \nSaren, 1995) relate directly to the need to re-examine the conventional assumptions of marketing \ntheory and practice which underpin political marketing research today.  Two key implications of \ncritical marketing stand out for our analysis of political marketing research. The first pertains to \nthe ideological construction of the \u2018market\u2019 and \u2018consumer\u2019 as discourses which must be \ncritically examined rather than assumed as \u2018natural,\u2019 let alone desirable, for consumers. The \nsecond relates to how political marketing, therefore, constructs citizens and concerned individuals \n-- in monolithic ways -- as consumers of products and services, thus encouraging party-voter \nrelationships which are commodified along the lines of the market; these, in turn, distort the \ngenuine needs and aspirations of voters. \n \nPolitical marketing research, therefore, needs to take into account the real effects of these \ndiscursive and ideological operations. There is much more scope within the field for greater \nrecognition of the fact that political phenomena is discursively embedded within political and \neconomic systems, through old and new media and new formats of marketing and \ncommunications.  Emerging research in political marketing (Kaid, 2004; Roper, 2005), for \ninstance, shows how critical marketing can be put to work in empirical analyses of political \nadvertising and communications. The powerful campaign that carried Barack Obama to the \nWhite House in 2009 will be remembered for its use of technologies such as Twitter, viral blogs, \nSMS, social networking sites, all of which were mobilised along with more traditional activist \nprogrammes such as volunteering, political advertising and so on. Such research would be \ngrounded in the view that political marketing is the marketing of texts as much as they are about \nthe infrastructure humans construct to interpret and manipulate those texts.  \n9 \n \n \nIn terms of how voters are constructed as consumers, a critical politics would need to \nacknowledge that these communicative platforms tread complex lines of race, ethnicity, gender \nand class.  These differences cannot, and should not, be obliterated through one-dimensional \nconstructions of the voter as a \u2018consumer\u2019.  We note that an ideology of marketing, embodied in \nmarketing discourse, has contributed to the current centrality of consumption in creating meaning \nand significance in people\u2019s lives (Gibson et al., 2003; Brownlie and Horne, 1999). Critical \nmarketing research recognises that marketers not only help provide for the physical needs of \nconsumers; they also provide the symbolic material for their identity construction and expression.   \nAs such, marketing has shaped and continues to shape the social sphere by defining the space \nwithin which social relations are constituted as social exchanges. A discourse of  political \nmarketing which constructs voters not as active citizens in civic society but as consumers \ndeciding which policies and politicians they will \u2018buy\u2019 with their vote must, therefore, be \nreflexively examined.    \n \nTaking all these arguments as a whole, it seems only logical to argue that scholars of political \nmarketing demonstrate greater awareness of our own, self-legitimating, discourses. Political \nmarketing research has largely ignored, or taken for granted, its own ideological bases. A \nreflexive introspection would provide an alternative position to the largely accepted idea that \npolitical marketing is (a self-proclaimed) democracy enhancer (see Kotler and Kotler, 1999).  A \ngood starting point would be, for example, to recognise the reflexive power of the marketing \ndiscourse itself in perpetuating inequitable relations between voters and institutional forces, \nbetween groups of individuals and between governments with widely divergent, yet \ninterconnected, agendas.  \n \n10 \n \n4.  WHAT WOULD A CRITICAL POLITICAL MARKETING AGENDA LOOK LIKE? \nThe critical marketing project does not draw attention towards \u2018new\u2019 marketing phenomena, but \nto the conditions of possibility of the \u2018new\u2019: how we might render different images of what we \nhave already decided is knowable. In this regard, critical marketing argues for a socially and \nhistorically located understanding of the discipline and the traditions that link the interpreter with \nwhat is interpreted (Arnold and Fischer, 1994; Holbrook, 1997; Brownlie, 2000; Burton, 2001, \n2005; Brownlie, 2006). For example, critical political marketing should be sceptical towards \nassociated truth claims, and express doubts about normalising precepts which are taken for \ngranted: such as the problems and consequences of conceiving political marketing management \nand practice as politically neutral. Together with a need to question the dominance of positivism \nwhich continues to inform so much empirical work undertaken in political marketing, we also \nquestion rational choice theory and neoclassical economic assumptions underlying political \nmarketing theory (see Savigny, 2008, 2006). Critical political marketing should open up the \nrange of acceptable, possible methodologies, and address a larger range of problems.  \n \nIn contrast to current conceptualizations of political marketing at present, we propose a \nconceptual framework to put different, sometimes interlinked, bodies of literature to work.  In so \ndoing, we aim to highlight the ways in which political marketing concepts and theories can be \ntested, undermined and\/or strengthened, even simultaneously. \n \nWe begin by calling for poststructuralist principles which emphasize the multidimensionality of \npolitical phenomena across multiple times and spaces (see Haraway, 1997; Appadurai, 1988; \nAnderson, 1991; Laclau and Mouffe, 2001) to be more actively embraced by political marketing \nresearchers. These views are sceptical of conventional or \u2018standard\u2019 descriptions of countries, \ngovernments, peoples and policies. Let us consider just two examples of how such theories can \n11 \n \ninfuse our framing of political phenomena. The first one relates to characterizations of political \nsegments, voter groups and \u2018special interests\u2019 in the political process. In the political marketing \nliterature, these descriptions tend to be static and essentialist. Too often, political marketing \nresearch relies on what -- to borrow a phrase from the social geographer, Karen Ettlinger -- calls \n\u201cconcise summations of, for example, \u201cwoman\u201d, \u201cAfrican American,\u201d \u201chomosexual,\u201d and so on\u201d \n(2004, p. 30) instead of probing the layers of how the political process itself produces and \nsustains ethnic, sexual and national differences and conflicts. The \u2018rational man\u2019 or \u2018rational \nvoter\u2019 is another construct which lends itself to this kind of revisionism.  \n \nAnother example which can be cited in this context, relates to the party-voter relationship. The \nanalysis of this relationship has been dominated up till now in the literature by instrumental \nmodes: strategies, tactics, advertising. Yet, the symbolic dimension which underlies material \nrepresentations of this relationship has not been explored in any great depth. We argue that \npolitical marketing research should advance beyond the marketing concept in 'traditional' \nmarketing by drawing upon a more nuanced understanding of critical accounts of \u2018consumer \nconsciousness\u2019 (Hirschmann and Holbrook, 1982; Gabriel and Lang, 1995) which shifts between \nsites of experience and identities. In a globally interconnected economy, political theatre is made \nwithin days or even minutes of poll results, campaign trails and policy announcements or even \nradio, T.V. and Internet advertisements. Underlying these processes, as sociologists and cultural \nresearchers know well, are the politics of consumption, and audience reception of cultural \nartifacts (see Axford and Huggins, 2002; Kellner, 1989 and 1995). \n \nThis particular aspect of critical social theory is profoundly important to political marketing. The \ncommercial forces, which drive what Horkheimer and Adorno (1948\/1972) called the \u201cculture \nindustry,\u201d found critical expression in the research of the Frankfurt School in the 1930s. A \n12 \n \ncomprehensive account of their many complex writings lies outside the scope of this paper, but \nAdorno\u2019s critique of mass television, music, film and political speeches (1991, 1994), Herzog\u2019s \ndiscussion of radio programmes (1941), Lowenthal\u2019s studies of popular culture (1961) provide \nample evidence of how all these agents mediate political reality for millions in Europe.  Their aim \nwas \u201cto explore and articulate ways in which conditions of social, economic and political \ndomination limit, distort and depreciate discourse regarding contested public issues\u201d (McClure, \n1996, p. 488).  On a global scale, Critical Theory led the way for a politics of human \nenlightenment and emancipation so that all (especially minority and vulnerable) interests may be \nmobilised against elites whose intentions were often kept hidden from those whose lives they \naffected. For many of the leading lights of Critical Theory, politics was a realm precisely where \nordinary men and women would be bewildered and disenfranchised by populist politics, even -- \nor especially -- in so-called \u2018democratic\u2019 societies.  Marcuse (1964), for instance, recognised that \nhuman reality (the economic, material and cultural operations of life) could easily be \noperationalised as a political function and thus be made the subject of arbitrary laws of the \nmarket, the economy and so on.  Thus, the very structures for which we depend on to serve us \nonly install and embed irrationality and the inherent resistance of societies to effect change by \nrational means. \n \nThe political realities of our times demand the kind of trenchant critique by disenfranchised \nvoters which the rhetoric and instruments of Critical Theory strongly suggest (the recent U.S. \nelection is one of the most gripping examples of our time, for example), and yet political \nmarketing researchers have yet to exploit this conceptual possibility in any great depth.  As \npolitical marketers wrestle with identifying the issues and solutions which characterize so-called \n\u2018democratic\u2019 societies, we contend that the structural parameters and constraints of the \u201cpublic \nsphere\u201d (Habermas, 1989) become even more integral to our understanding of the emancipatory \n13 \n \nprojects which engage politicians, voters, backbenchers, frontbenchers, policymakers and media \nprofessionals across the political spectrum.   \n \nFurther, Critical Theory is invaluable in helping researchers discover and unmask the \npositionings and power relations between and within groups which influence voting outcomes. \nRather than fixing on one or two trajectories in a political campaign, we can feature a more \ndynamic analysis between people and their nodes of influence to take into account symbolic and \ndiscursive representations of thoughts, emotions, and other media not just between people but \nalso between people and texts (see Fineman, 2000;  Law and Hassard, 1999).  The textuality of \npolitical institutions and actors are to be understood as both material and immaterial. \n \nTo take the argument further, we need to radicalize the content of political marketing itself (see \nHenneberg, 2007), but not simply in terms of its \u2018scope\u2019 or coverage. \u2018Political\u2019 phenomena, in \nfact, is a problematic category which needs a stronger exegesis and grounding in contemporary \naccounts of \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018identity\u2019, particularly in helping us push the envelope of the sub-\ndiscipline further in the direction of cultural economy and the different constructions of \u2018politics\u2019 \nin different spheres of civil society (du Gay et al., 1996; du Gay, 2007; Hall and du Gay, 1996). \nA key point of relevance for political marketing scholarship in these kinds of explorations is the \nways in which persons and personalities (behind the podium, at a convention, rally or conference, \nin front of supporters and so on) are constituted out of prior regimes of behaviour and social \npatterning (du Gay, 2007). \n \nYet another critical approach is the discursive method, as applied in the marketing literature to \nunderstand identity and power relations in advertising (see Elliott and Ritson, 1997; Elliott, \n1996). The range of methods which fall under this school of conceptual exploration can be \n14 \n \napplied in critical and political fields to understand political disputes and political rhetoric (e.g. \nSch\u00f6n and Rein, 1994). A critically-oriented political marketing research agenda needs \nmethods\/methodologies which recognise and manage the ideological nature of texts and \ndiscourses. Critical discourse analysis (see Fairclough, 1989; Fairclough and Wodak, 1997; J\u00e4ger, \n2001; Wodak et al., 1999; Titscher et al., 2000; Wodak, 2001), for example, could provide the \ntools to approach the issue of power relations between and within groups which influence voting \noutcomes. For the purposes of political marketing research, critical discourse analysis can be used \nto analyse \u2018exogenous\u2019 phenomenon in politics (e.g. election campaigns; party behaviour; \ncommunication material; media appearances, etc), but could also be used \u2018internally\u2019 to critically \nanalyse the knowledge claims of political marketing literature.  \n \nAn emancipatory critical political marketing project should seek to determine alternative models \nof political representation and participation which would be more in line with democratic ideals. \nSavigny (2008) uses this point, in fact, to address one of the main criticisms against political \nmarketing. The systems of texts through which such models are mediated and expressed thus \nbecome critical for political marketing research. Critical discourse analytical methodology,  \ntherefore, becomes a powerful tool for addressing the challenges attached to the analysis of \ncomplex, potentially polemical and contested discourses, such as the discursive construction of \nnational identities (e.g. de Cillia et al., 1999; Wodak et al., 1999); race relations (e.g. Richardson, \n2008; Teo, 2000), extreme-right politics (e.g. Moufahim et al., 2007; Martin-Rojo and van Dijk, \n1997), war and peace-keeping (e.g. Ferrari, 2007; Graham et al, 2004); policy debate and \nfinancial regulation (Gallhofer et al., 2001); campaigning tactics and positioning (Roper, 2005). \nA critical approach proved invaluable to Weaver, Motion, and Roper in their analysis of \npropaganda and public relations (see Weaver et al., 2006). Both propaganda and public relations \nwere framed as (self-) legitimating discourse practices furthering specific interests.  Drawing on \n15 \n \nthe work of Habermas, Foucault and Fairclough, the authors analysed public relations\u2019 discourse \n(along with the embedded notions of truth, power, and knowledge), and the engineering of public \nopinion and social action (Weaver et al, 2006). They questioned the accepted idea that \npropaganda necessarily operates against the public interest, and that public relations necessarily \nworks for the public interest (Weaver et al., 2006, p. 23; original emphasis). They showed \notherwise:  \n \n[\u2026] discourse theory helps to move away from the notion of propaganda as deception and \nlying because it acknowledges the potential for competing truths in society: multiple \ndiscourses circulate and compete with each other for hegemonic power and therefore there \nis a choice of meanings, identities and realities available to audiences, not one all-\npowerful construction of reality (Weaver et al., 2004, p. 23).  \n \nThis a similar approach that we are championing for approaching and understanding political \nmarketing discourse and practice, in our so-called critical political marketing agenda.  \n \n5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n \nWe began the paper by identifying the key issues which exercise political marketing scholars in \nterms of the field\u2019s continuing theoretical and empirical development. In their search to establish \nthe ontological and epistemological assumptions of political marketing and to carve out a distinct \nand attractive disciplinary space for it, political marketing scholars have already demonstrated a \nhealthy scepticism towards its development thus far and a willingness to consider further \ntheoretical developments in the field. Our paper argues that a range of critical theories which \nhave opened up debates in other fields can further drive the political marketing research agenda. \nCritical marketing viewpoints were taken in this paper, which provide an approach to the study of \n16 \n \nmarketing in a political context focusing on ideological formations borne out of the rigorous \nscrutiny of bourgeois culture and revolutionary movements (Habermas, 1989) as well as the \ncritique of academic discourses.  If we accept that ideas in relation to marketing are part of a \nbroader discourse -- the discourse of neoliberalism, for instance, makes the ideas and language of \nmarketing acceptable, rendering them intelligible (Savigny, 2008, p. 74) \u2013 then political \nmarketing, too, needs to avail itself of a much greater range of ideas than it has hitherto done.  \n \nIf political marketing is understood as an instrument that frames and legitimates political \ndiscourse in the eyes of voters, then we need new epistemological tools to capture the \nmechanisms of such legitimation beyond an analysis of instruments, tactics, branding or even \nlinguistically-based methods. Instead, political marketing research needs to take into account \nmore polemical and activist discourses in other fields, as we have shown. For instance, political \nmarketing researchers take for granted that the ability to connect with voters is a key issue for \npolitical parties and that marketing discourse is mainly used strategically by parties to make their \nspeeches \u2018voter-friendly\u2019 and encourage the consumption of their political \u2018product\u2019. Yet, how \nmuch do we know about the conditions which make such strategies possible and desirable in the \nfirst place? What are the tools which allow such discoveries to be made? Is marketing used as a \nform of legitimating discourse to make politics accessible to people who have been socialised in a \nconsumer society or is it a way of manufacturing \u2018consensus\u2019 in the public sphere? What are the \nvarious \u2018spheres\u2019 \u2018out there\u2019 and who or what do they exclude or silence? By incorporating our \nproposed research agenda, new kinds of questions can be raised in political marketing and \ntackled. \n \nRaising these questions throws the spotlight on the field in a new, perhaps uncomfortable, light.  \nPolitical marketing makes normative-sounding claims that it is \u2018good\u2019, i.e. a convincing self-\n17 \n \nproclamation to be a democracy enhancer1\n \n (see Kotler and Kotler, 1999). In saying this, we have \nalso noted, as researchers in the field ourselves, that political marketing scholars are certainly not \nwrong to defend the sub-discipline and to advocate the application of a marketing orientation to \nthe conduct of politics.  What we do can certainly contribute to a better representation of \nconstituents (Savigny, 2004) provided we are more critically aware of their changing and \nmultiple identities, their changing aspirations and the increasing corporatization and globalization \nof consumers (noting that stable definitions of any or all such groups must remain a provisional \nexercise at all times).  \nIn conclusion, political marketing has the potential to emerge as an interdisciplinary subject \nwhich would inform not only the application of marketing tools and concepts to politics but also   \nthe legacy of social theory that informs the study of post-industrial consumer societies today. To \ndo so is to embark upon a rewarding, albeit risky, journey. It is still the case, as Morgan argues, \nthat \u201cmarketing is a substantial and powerful discourse which is currently dominated by a highly \npositivistic and normative approach to knowledge\u201d (1992, p. 154).  Political marketing seems to \nbe no exception.   \n \nUnderstanding political marketing as a discourse and opening it up to critical theories of society \noffers what we believe is a powerful agenda.  Integrating the two levels of analysis presents the \nnext challenge for researchers.  Future research and thought in this area is needed to lay out the \nspecific problems and avenues for such a project.  A synthesis of relevant theories relating to \nclass, gender, sexuality, cultural and socio-economic preferences, for instance, has yet to be \nattempted and it is hoped that our paper plays a role in the emergence of such a project among \ndifferent networks of political marketing researchers and academics. Given the plethora of \n                                                 \n1  By providing the consumer with a product they want, the political process is presented as responsive to \nconsumer demand, which in turn is assumed to make politicians more accountable (Savigny, 2004: 33)  \n18 \n \ntheories and values circulating around common constructs like the \u2018consumer\u2019, the \u2018voter\u2019 and, on \na much broader scale, \u2018society\u2019, \u2018identity\u2019 and \u2018politics\u2019 itself, an agenda which maps out diverse \nframings of these concepts within the field of political marketing can only be a healthy \ndevelopment for the field.  Most importantly perhaps, a critical political marketing project should \nnot, in our opinion, exclude a necessary dose of irreverence, polemic, and rejuvenation to allow \nan enrichment of the discipline\u2019s theoretical basis, or indeed, a questioning spirit which can \nalways raise the tantalising question with which we began: \u2018Towards a Critical Marketing \nAgenda?\u2019 \n \n_____________________________________________________________________ \n19 \n \nBibliography \n \nAppadurai, A.
