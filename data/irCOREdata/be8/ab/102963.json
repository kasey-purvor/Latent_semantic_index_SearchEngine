Emergency\ndepartments, on the other hand, will see\nthe largest number and spectrum of\ninjury cases, usually presenting very\nshortly after injury in a single healthcare\nsetting. This has the potential to max-\nimize recruitment efficiency and mini-\nmize recruiting costs. Recruiting in\nemergency departments also provides\nopportunities to study the aetiology and\nepidemiology of injuries before recall of\nevents diminishes with time and to enroll\nparticipants for studying short- and long-\nterm consequences of injury. They are the\nonly setting in which complete ascertain-\nment of incident cases of specific injuries\nmay be possible\u2014for example, virtually\nall patients with long bone fractures will\nattend an emergency department, fewer\nwill attend primary care and a proportion\nwill be admitted to hospital, but this\nwill vary between hospitals depending on\na range of factors including clinician\npreference for management options, bed\navailability, social circumstances.3 4\nRecruiting cases from emergency depart-\nments therefore, has the potential to\nminimize the selection bias inherent in\nrecruiting such cases from other sites.\nWHY CAN IT BE DIFFICULT TO\nRECRUIT STUDY PARTICIPANTS IN\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS?\nInspite of the potential for recruiting\ninjured patients to studies within emer-\ngency departments, there are character-\nistics of the clinical setting and of injured\npatients which may make recruitment\ndifficult. Emergency departments are\noften busy and crowded places, and the\ndemand for emergency care continues to\nincrease.5 Many emergency departments\nexperience shortfalls in medical staffing\nand difficulties in recruiting and main-\ntaining skilled nursing staff, certainly\nwithin the UK.6 Shift work and national\nand international workforce initiatives,\nwhich impact on work patterns of junior\nmedical staff (eg, the UK Modernising\nMedical Careers Foundation Programme,\nwhich allows junior medical staff to\nexperience a wide range of specialties\nfor 4-month periods,7 and the European\nWorking Time Directive), mean that a\nlarge number of staff, a significant\nproportion of whom will change over a\nrelatively short period of time, may need\nto be involved in recruiting patients.\nMany injured patients do not spend\nlong periods of time in emergency depart-\nments, indeed in England the govern-\nment set a target that by 2004 no one\nshould wait more than 4 h in an emer-\ngency department from arrival to admis-\nsion to a bed, transfer or discharge.5\nRecent data suggest that only 5% of\npatients exceed this waiting time, with\nsmaller figures for more minor injuries.6\nHence, there may be only a small time\nwindow within which participants can\nbe recruited. Emergency department\npatients can also have complicated jour-\nneys, moving frequently both within and\noutside of the department (eg, from\nwaiting room to trolley while waiting for\ncubicle, to cubicle, to x ray, to plaster\nroom and then discharged), so research-\ners may have difficulty finding where the\npatient is and may have little time to\ndiscuss the study before the patient is\nmoved to another clinical area.\nFurthermore, most emergency depart-\nment attendances are single encounters,6\nso there is no ongoing patient\u2013clinician\nrelationship and patients may feel little\naffiliation with, or allegiance to the\ndepartment, which may affect their will-\ningness to participate in research. Finally,\nemergency department attenders who\nperceive themselves to be \u2018\u2018at fault\u2019\u2019 for\ntheir injury, or for it to be in some way\n\u2018\u2018self-inflicted\u2019\u2019 may be less willing to\nparticipate in research studies.\nThere are some specific injuries that\nmay be more difficult to recruit to studies\nthan others. This includes rare injuries,\nsuch as those in the farm workers in the\nstudy by Day et al,8 those where once\nserious injury has been excluded the\npatient gets discharged very quickly\u2014for\nexample, minor head injuries\u2014and those\nwhere the patient\u2019s condition or manage-\nment makes the physical process of\nrecruitment difficult\u2014for example, those\nwho are immobilized who may find read-\ning information sheets difficult (eg, sus-\npected neck injuries) or would have\ndifficulty signing consent forms (eg, domi-\nnant hand or arm injuries). Patients who\nhave had serious injury are often not well\nplaced to give valid, informed consent\nimmediately afterwards: they may be\nfrightened, in pain or under the influence\nof powerful medications.9 In some cases,\nthey are too incapacitated to understand\nor retain information and may even be\ndeeply unconscious.\nHOW DO PRIVACY LEGISLATION,\nETHICAL AND RESEARCH\nGOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS\nAFFECT RECRUITING IN\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS?\nA combination of privacy legislation,\nethical or research governance require-\nments may affect recruiting participants\nfrom emergency departments in several\nways. Firstly, the requirement for health-\ncare providers to make the first approach\nto potential participants prevents\nresearchers from identifying potential\nparticipants in the department or making\nthe first approach themselves. It is argued\nthat this benefits the patient as health\ninformation, such as knowledge of a\nparticular injury or of attendance at a\nhealthcare facility is not divulged by\nhealthcare providers to researchers.10 The\nother potential patient benefit is that it\nmay be easier for patients to decline\nparticipation in a study when the first\napproach is made by someone other than\na member of the research team. As this\nsystem relies on healthcare staff, whose\nprime concern is patient care, to identify\npotentially eligible participants and to\nmake the first approach, it is unsurprising\nthat achieving recruitment targets is\ndifficult in these circumstances.\nThe second and closely related issue is\nthat of the (not necessarily universal)11\nrequirement for \u2018\u2018opt-in\u2019\u2019 systems for\nrecruitment, of particular relevance for\nSee linked article, p 88\nCOMMENTARY 75\nwww.injuryprevention.com\n group.bmj.com on October 5, 2010 - Published by injuryprevention.bmj.comDownloaded from \nnon-face-to-face methods, such as postal\nrecruitment. Under the \u2018\u2018opt-in\u2019\u2019\napproach, researchers are only allowed\nto contact potential participants who\nrespond positively to a request that they\ncan be contacted by the researcher, from a\nmember of the healthcare team. There is\nevidence that \u2018\u2018opt-in\u2019\u2019 approaches are\nassociated with lower response and\/or\nrecruitment rates,8 12 13 and hence, with\nincreased research costs. If lower recruit-\nment rates result in failing to achieve the\nrequired sample size, this is also an\nethical issue, as Crombie points out,\n\u2018\u2018Research should only be undertaken\nwhen there is a high likelihood of\nproducing valid findings. Ethical require-\nments which result in invalid research\nmay themselves be unethical\u2019\u2019.14 \u2018\u2018Opt-in\u2019\u2019\napproaches have been found to be asso-\nciated with response or recruitment\nbiases related to age, gender, residence\nin deprived areas, ethnic group, preferred\nlanguage, mortality rates, length of hos-\npital stay, level of consciousness, family\nhistory of disease and in preferred health-\ncare decision-making roles.12 13 15 Such\nbiases may result in under-recruitment\nof those at greatest risk or those who may\nbenefit most from an intervention, inac-\ncurate estimation of the incidence or\nprevalence of conditions, a reduction in\npower to detect subgroup differences and\nlimited generalizability of the findings.10\n\u2018\u2018Opt-in\u2019\u2019 systems may, therefore, be\nachieving patient confidentiality at the\nexpense of scientific rigor.\nHow concerned are patients about the\nconfidentiality of their health informa-\ntion in relation to research? There is little\nevidence on this to date, but a recent large\nsurvey of the British public found 87%\nwould not consider it an invasion of their\nprivacy by the National Cancer Registry if\nthey sent them a letter asking them to\ntake part in a research study.16 Other\nstudies have found only a very small\nnumber of potential participants queried\nor complained about a researchers\u2019 right\nto approach them and most respondents\nin an Australian survey were in favor of\nhealth databases being used for research\npurposes.8 17 18\nClearly, a balance has to be struck\nbetween the patient\u2019s right to confidenti-\nality and the benefits of medical research\nto society. The UK\u2019s Academy of Medical\nSciences has joined this debate with their\nrecent report on using health information\nin medical research. This outlines the\nbenefits of medical research to society\nand acknowledges that it is increasingly\nbeing inhibited by \u2018\u2018inappropriate con-\nstraints on the use of personal health\ndata\u2019\u2019.19 It makes a series of recom-\nmendations on interpreting the legal\nframework, improving regulatory pro-\ncesses, developing good practice in\nresearch using personal data, harnessing\nthe opportunities provided by new\nNational Health Service information tech-\nnology and engaging the public. Although\nthis is a UK document, the recommenda-\ntions will be relevant to other countries\nwith similar legislative, ethical and\nresearch governance arrangements. Other\nrecent suggestions to facilitate research\nwithin the National Health Service include\nmaking \u2018\u2018its research mission explicit\nwhen people use the service, in the same\nway that patients attending a teaching\nhospital are informed about and invited to\nparticipate in the professional education\nthat happens there\u2019\u2019.20\nFinally, the issues surrounding the\nrecruitment of incapacitated patients to\nresearch studies are particularly pertinent\nto emergency departments. These have\nbeen addressed in relation to clinical\ntrials in varying ways in different coun-\ntries. In the US, a waiver of consent\nallows researchers to enroll incapacitated\npatients into trials provided that they\nfulfill trial entry criteria, although this\nposition is currently under review.21 In\nthe European Union (EU), the EU\nDirective 2001\/20\/EC requires prior\ninformed written consent before subjects\ncan be recruited to clinical trials of\nmedicinal products. This has led to sub-\nstantial difficulties in establishing high-\nquality trials in emergency care22 and the\ndevelopment of recommendations for\nchanges to the EU Directive to allow such\nresearch to proceed under clearly defined\nconditions.23 In the UK, a suitable legal\nframework now exists, under the\nMedicines for Human Use (Clinical\nTrials) Regulations 2004. This allows a\npersonal legal representative or profes-\nsional legal representative to consent on\nbehalf of an incapacitated patient,24 but\nthe framework seems to be inconsistently\napplied, with areas of potential confusion\nand a lack of central guidance.25 26\nAlthough this framework should prove\nhelpful for clinical trials, recruiting inca-\npacitated patients to other study designs\nmay still prove problematic.\nHOW CAN RECRUITMENT TO\nRESEARCH STUDIES IN\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS BE\nMAXIMIZED?\nHere, we draw on our experience in\nrecruiting more than 1000 injured\npatients to the UK Burden of Injury\nStudy, which is a prospective cohort study\nmeasuring injury-related disability in\npatients aged >5 years presenting with\na wide range of injuries to four emergency\ndepartments in the UK. Our experience\nsuggests that the following strategies may\nbe helpful:\nN It is very important to build and\nmaintain good relationships with emer-\ngency department staff. Involving emer-\ngency department staff in the design of\nthe study in the early stages will\nincrease their ownership of it. Raising\nawareness of the study and offering\nrepeated briefing sessions for the staff\nare necessary. In large departments, it\nmay take several months to get to meet\nall relevant staff and this time needs to\nbe built into the project. Debriefing\nsessions with emergency department\nstaff are helpful to refine recruitment\nmethods, tailor them to local require-\nments, identify any problems and agree\non locally appropriate solutions.\nN Use dedicated researchers based in the\nemergency department to undertake\nrecruiting.27 Researchers with experi-\nence in undertaking clinical work in\nthe department that they will be\nrecruiting in will know how the\ndepartment works, what clinical and\ninformation technology systems are in\nplace and will already be known to the\nemergency department staff.\nN Maintain a presence in the depart-\nment. It is important that staff get to\nknow the researchers and that the\nresearchers are there when potentially\neligible participants are in the emer-\ngency department, including evenings\nand weekends. Although this may\nseem to entail a lot of waiting around\nfor the researcher, relying on busy\nemergency department staff to notify\n(absent) researchers when potentially\neligible patients are in the department\ni s u n l i k e l y t o b e e f f e c t i v e .\nComputerized systems for notifying\nresearchers when eligible patients are\nin the department have been found to\nbe effective in increasing recruitment\nin previous studies,28 but this has not\nbeen feasible in the UK Burden of\nInjury Study.\nN Even if dedicated research staff are\nused to recruit participants, healthcare\nstaff will still spend time on the\nresearch study. Acknowledge and pay\nfor the time spent by emergency\ndepartment staff on research studies\nand build such costs into research\nproposals.\nN Timing of recruitment. There are times\nwhen the emergency department is too\nbusy and the staff do not have time to\napproach potential participants.\nRecruiting at slightly less busy times\nmay be more effective.\nDay et al\u2019s8 modified recruitment\nmethod, of using either a written \u2018\u2018opt-\nin\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018opt-out\u2019\u2019 letter sent by the hospital\nwas also considered by our study team. We\nsought ethical approval to use a written\n76 COMMENTARY\nwww.injuryprevention.com\n group.bmj.com on October 5, 2010 - Published by injuryprevention.bmj.comDownloaded from \n\u2018\u2018opt-in\u2019\u2019 letter sent by the emergency\ndepartment consultant, but approval was\nnot granted on the grounds that it might\nhave alerted family members to the\npatient\u2019s attendance at the emergency\ndepartment. Such a decision is concerning\nas inability to use even an \u2018\u2018opt-in\u2019\u2019 letter\nwill only serve to make recruitment in\nemergency departments more difficult.\nCONCLUSION\nRecruiting injured patients to research\nstudies in emergency departments has\nparticular challenges due to the nature of\nthe clinical setting and of the patients\nthat present to emergency departments.\nCurrent privacy legislation, and ethical\nand research governance requirements\nhave the potential to reduce participation\nrates and to bias study populations.\nPractical experience of recruiting partici-\npants in emergency departments suggests\nthat recruitment can be successful, but\nthat, where healthcare providers have to\nmake the first approach to patients, the\n(not inconsiderable) costs of using this\napproach need to be incorporated into\nresearch proposals. The difficulties faced\nby researchers in using personal health\ndata are being acknowledged and recent\nguidance from the Academy of Medical\nSciences should help facilitate such\nresearch.\nInjury Prevention 2007;13:75\u201377.\ndoi: 10.1136\/ip.2006.013730\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nDenise Kendrick, Lindsay Groom, Rachel\nMurphy, Division of Primary Care, University\nPark, Nottingham, UK\nRonan Lyons, Centre for Health Information,\nResearch and Evaluation (CHIRAL), School of\nMedicine Swansea University, Swansea, UK\nNicola Christie, Surrey Injury Research Group,\nPostgraduate Medical School, Daphne Jackson\nRoad, Manor Park, University of Surrey,\nGuildford, UK\nElizabeth Towner, Centre for Child and\nAdolescent Health, Faculty of Health and Social\nCare, University of the West of England,\nHampton House, Cotham Hill, Bristol, UK\nJonathan Benger, Centre for Clinical and\nHealth Services Research, Faculty of Health and\nSocial Care, University of the West of England,\nGlenside Campus, Bristol, UK\nFrank Coffey, Phillip Miller, Emergency\nDepartment, Nottingham University Hospitals\nNHS Trust, Queen\u2019s Medical Centre Campus,\nNottingham, UK\nCorrespondence to: Dr D Kendrick, Division of\nPrimary Care, Floor 13, Tower Building,\nUniversity Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK;\ndenise.kendrick@nottingham.ac.uk\nAccepted 5 December 2006\nCompeting interests: None.\nREFERENCES\n1 Lyons RA, Brophy S, Pockett R, et al.
