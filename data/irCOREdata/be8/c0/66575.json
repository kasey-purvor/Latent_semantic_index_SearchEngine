The concept of an emergent global civil society (GCS), an identifiable public sphere\nof voluntary association distinct from the architecture of states and markets, has become\nvoguish in some approaches to international relations and international political economy,\nand in the practices of global governance. This article seeks to reveal the limitations of the\nprevailing commonsense framing of GCS. Challenging the idea that we can isolate an\nunambiguous GCS sphere, we focus instead on the particular uses of GCS \u2013 on the practices\nthat are shaped in its name. We make a number of interventions to emphasise the conceptual\nand political ambiguity of GCS. First, we shift the emphasis from GCS as a bounded \u2018non-\ngovernmental\u2019 space to GCS as precisely a means of making global politics governable in\nparticular ways. Second, we question the assumption of GCS as \u2018voluntary association\u2019,\nasking what it means for GCS to embody or represent the interests of social groups. Finally,\nwe raise questions of the image of empowerment through GCS, highlighting the power\nrelations, tensions and contradictions at the heart of a transformative politics.\nAs a group of academics debating the conceptual and practical implications of global\ncivil society (GCS), meeting in rural Wales in late summer 2001, we became acutely\naware of the proximity (and also the disjuncture) of the relationship between our\ndiscussions and the \u2018real\u2019 world of global politics.1 The date was September 11th and\nquestions of power, responsibility, representation, and the inclusions and exclusions\nof GCS came tragically to the fore. It is these questions as to the constitutive effects\nof the discourse of GCS that we find somewhat neglected in the debate to date. The\nconcept of an emergent GCS, an identifiable public sphere of voluntary association\ndistinct from the architecture of states and markets, has become voguish in some\napproaches to international relations (IR) and international political economy (IPE),\nand in the practices of global governance. It is the limitations imposed by such\ncommonsense framings of GCS that we felt were partially responsible for our\ninability to find the means to begin to understand what happened on that day.\nIn this article, refuting the idea that we can isolate a clearly defined GCS sphere,\nwe focus instead on the particular uses of the concept of GCS as it is deployed to\nlegitimate and challenge the discourse and practice of global governance. Sensitive\nto what is done in the name of GCS, we are interested in the specific representation\nthat has enabled neoliberal conceptions of global governance to flourish. Our\ninterest should not be read as an act of political closure. Rather, it is our intention to\nreopen areas of the GCS debate that we feel have been prematurely closed down.\nThe policy prescriptions and commentaries of the principal international organis-\nations have tended to treat GCS as a neutral category, populated in a pluralistic\nfashion by voluntary associations, thereby depoliticising its significance in governing\nthe global political economy. By contrast, academic discussion in IR\/IPE has tended\nto assert the transformative potential of GCS, particularly in terms of the capacity\nof groups to defy neoliberalism and democratise global governance. As the first part\nof this article shows, both positions tend to turn upon a particular representation of\nGCS. We characterise this by way of shorthand, thus: GCS as bounded space; GCS\nas voluntary associations; and GCS as agent of empowerment\/resistance. In high-\nlighting this representation, and whilst we are sympathetic to the normative concerns\nof many of our IR\/IPE colleagues, it is our view that if we are to meaningfully open\nup the possibilities of GCS we must recognise the politics involved in the mapping\nout of what a GCS might look like. Both the discourse and the practices of GCS\ncontain contradictions, that is they simultaneously exclude, control and discipline, as\nthey also hold out the potential for resistance.\nIn the second part of the article, then, we make a number of interventions that\nseek to disrupt commonsense understandings of GCS. First, we shift the emphasis\nfrom GCS as a bounded \u2018non-governmental\u2019 and non-market domain to GCS as a\nmeans of making the global political economy governable in particular ways. We see\nthe discussion of GCS as telling us something significant about contemporary efforts\nto manage and transform mechanisms of government. Andr\u00e9 Drainville\u2019s observ-\nations of \u2018the making of a compliant citizenry\u2019,2 coupled with the Foucauldian-\ninspired governmentality literature, serve to challenge the delineation of civil society\nfrom state and market on which neoliberal global governance programmes rest.\nSecond, we question the tendency to define GCS as a bounded, coherent sphere of\nagency. Most accounts of GCS seem overly tempted to list institutions and actors \u2013\ntrade unions, church groups, women\u2019s associations and so on \u2013 that are assumed to\nconstitute a coherent force for \u2018good\u2019. By contrast, we ask what it means for GCS to\nbe \u2018representative\u2019 of particular interests. In our view, such institutional conceptions\nof GCS deny the unbounded, fluid and mobile character of the everyday struggles\nthat a politicised reading of GCS would need to acknowledge. Finally, we raise\nquestions of the image of empowerment through GCS that has accompanied the\nglobal governance debates. Following a diverse literature that warns of the \u2018inequality\nand domination\u2019 that has been \u2018built into the concept of \u201ccivil society\u201d from the\nstart\u2019,3 we are concerned with the exclusions and oppressions \u2018inscribed in civil\nsociety\u2019.4 In sum, our intervention does not lead us to reject the potential for a\ntransformative GCS that our IR\/IPE colleagues are apt to identify. Rather, we see\nthe power relations that find expression in the governing of the global political\neconomy, and the tensions and contradictions of an emergent GCS (and not the\nconsensus and interdependencies), to be central to the politics of transformation.\n90 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n2 Andr\u00e9 Drainville, \u2018The Fetishism of Global Civil Society: Global Governance, Transnational\nUrbanism and Sustainable Capitalism in the World Economy\u2019, in M.

The international politics of\nsovereign states is held to be increasingly challenged in juridical and practical terms\nby the transnationalising and deterritorialised character of contemporary social\nrelations.6 Such restructuring has given rise to a range of concepts, often devised in\nrelation to well-worn notions, that seek to characterise and bring meaning to change.\nScholars in IR\/IPE, for example, talk of a \u2018post-Westphalian\u2019 politics or a \u2018new\nmedievalism\u2019.7 It is the concept of \u2018global governance\u2019 that has, however, become the\nmost prominent in accounts and policy prescriptions of the decentred, multilayered\nand overlapping character of contemporary political authority.8 State institutions\nincreasingly engage in multilateral agreements (regional and international), and\ninternational organisations such as the G-7, OECD, World Bank, IMF and WTO\ntake on an expanded importance. Meanwhile, a wide array of \u2018private\u2019 institutions\nincluding industrial and financial associations and professional \u2018experts\u2019 such as\naccountants, consultants and economists also come to exercise significant authority.9\nWith such proclaimed global governance has come a sharp growth in the activities of\nso-called non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that include the likes of Oxfam,\nSave the Children and the Red Crescent. While forging close working relationships\nwith international organisations to, for example, run the refugee camps and design\nand carry out development projects, NGOs and broader social movements have also\nmobilised in an attempt to shape international policies and challenge the social\nrelations of the status quo.10 It is this enormously diverse array of NGOs and social\nmovements that tends to be the focus in a discourse of GCS that has become\nubiquitous in the discussions and practices of global governance.\nWhile we are sympathetic to the desire to map the contours of this global trans-\nformation, we are concerned to acknowledge that the ways in which we understand,\nAmbiguities of global civil society 91\n5 Richard Falk, \u2018Global Civil Society: Perspectives, Initiatives, Movements\u2019, Oxford Development\nStudies, 26:1 (1998), p. 99.\n6 See, for example, Jan Aart Scholte, Globalization: A Critical Introduction (Basingstoke: Palgrave,\n2000), pp. 132\u201358.\n7 See Mark Zacher, \u2018The Decaying of the Westphalian Temple: Implications for International Order\nand Governance\u2019, in James N.

Our purpose would\ncontrast with that of Col\u00e1s, for example, for whom the importance of the concept of\n\u2018civil society\u2019 lies in its explanatory utility, \u2018the most adequate way of exploring the\nrole of collective agency in international relations\u2019.11 Grounded in an awareness of\nthe constitutive effects of the meanings ascribed to GCS, then, we are interested in\nthe ways in which the inseparable normative and descriptive aspects of the GCS\ndiscourse impinge upon our collective capacity to understand and challenge the\ncontemporary global political economy.\nGCS as bounded space\nRepresentatives of international organisations and academic commentators on\nworld order tend to share the ideal-typical representation of GCS as an identifiable\nspace, sphere, realm or \u2018third system\u2019,12 bounded by and differentiated from states\nand governance on the one hand and economy on the other. As a consequence, GCS\ntakes on a non-economic and, especially significant for us, a non-governmental set of\ncharacteristics.\nIn a statement that is representative of the discursive practices of the inter-\nnational organisations, the World Bank describes civil society as \u2018the arena in which\npeople come together to pursue the interests they hold in common \u2013 not for profit or\nthe exercise of political power, but because they care enough about something to\ntake collective action\u2019.13 Meanwhile many in the academic community share a very\nsimilar spatial assumption. For instance, the first of Anheier, Glasius and Kaldor\u2019s\nthree propositions for the study of GCS is that \u2018What we can observe in the 1990s is\nthe emergence of a supranational sphere of social and political participation\u2019.14 Not\nonly is this sphere distinct from the practices of governance and economy, but they\ndepict it as existing \u2018above and beyond national, regional, or local societies\u2019. Falk\nconcurs, casting GCS as a \u2018field of action\u2019 that provides \u2018an alternative ideological\nand political space to that currently occupied by market-orientated and statist\noutlooks\u2019.15 It is this vision of GCS as a \u2018solidarity sphere\u201916, and its associated\nnormative undertones of progressive transformation through collective association\nthat, by and large, distinguishes academic commentaries from those of the inter-\nnational organisations. As activists in Asia, Latin America and particularly Eastern\nEurope recognised during the 1970s and 1980s, \u2018the ideal of societal space, autono-\nmous from the state, wherein self-management and democracy could be worked\nout\u201917 is of considerable utility to those seeking social transformation.\n92 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n11 Alejandro Col\u00e1s, International Civil Society: Social Movements in World Politics (Cambridge: Polity\nPress, 2002), pp. 13\u201314.\n12 Falk, \u2018Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 100.\n13 World Bank, Consultations with Civil Society Organizations: General Guidelines for World Bank Staff\n(Washington, DC: The World Bank, 2000), p. 5.\n14 Helmut Anheier, Marlies Glasius, and Mary Kaldor, \u2018Introducing Global Civil Society\u2019, in Anheier,\nGlasius and Kaldor (eds.)

Alexander, \u2018The Paradoxes of Civil Society\u2019, International Sociology, 12: 2 (1997), pp. 115\u201333.\n17 Gideon Baker, \u2018The Taming of the Idea of Civil Society\u2019, Democratization, 6: 3 (1999), pp. 1\u201329.\nThe representation of GCS as a bounded space filled with particular non-\ngovernmental and non-economic characteristics draws in large part on the long\nhistory of theories of civil society. Given the undoubted influence of neoliberal\neconomics and the ideals of liberal democracy in the contemporary global political\neconomy, it is not surprising that liberal conceptions of civil society have also once\nagain proved powerful.18 International organisations such as the World Bank have\nbeen very much at the heart of propagating the neoliberal Washington consensus.\nSpatial metaphors were strong in the early liberal vision of civil society associated\nwith Smith and Hegel, a realm for the pursuit of particular interests that could be\ndistinguished from the universality embodied by the state. Later the divorce of a\nliberal civil society of collective associations from the private sphere became central\nto the development of capitalism and modernity.19 Meanwhile, the Gramscian\nconception of civil society has proved especially influential, both explicitly and\nimplicitly, amongst activists and academics of GCS. For Gramsci, civil society was\ndistinct from the economic base and distinguishable from the state, characterised as\n\u2018the realm in which the existing social order is grounded\u2019 and in which resides \u2018the\ncombination of forces upon which the support for a new state and a new order can\nbe built\u2019.20 That alternative theories of civil society tend to inform the different views\nof international organisations and the academic community has, however, done little\nto raise question-marks over the portrayal of GCS as bounded space.\nThe use of spatial metaphors to discern the contours of GCS is clearly not as\nunproblematic as common sense would suggest. As Hegel and those writing in the\ntradition of historical materialism would wish to remind us, the construction of\nGCS as a bounded sphere obscures the extent to which civil society, economy and\nstate (and other institutions of governance) are necessarily intertwined and mutually\nconstituting.21 As Keane is at pains to stress, GCS is in many ways \u2018overdetermined\u2019\nby wider sets of forces.22 The state and other institutions of governance in particular\nprovide the political and legal framework that institutionalises civil society\u2019s\nnormative prerequisites. As such it is the broadly liberal form taken by state-\nsocieties, so central to modern political economy, that by advancing and protecting\nbasic rights has historically filled European civil society with much of its meaning.\nPut another way and in the terms of the great traditions of civil society, \u2018liberalism\ncannot work without republicanism, the public remaking of the private\u2019.23 In turn,\ncivil associations typically focus on the state to achieve change or resist state policies\nAmbiguities of global civil society 93\n18 Hakan Seckinelgin, \u2018Civil Society as a Metaphor for Western Liberalism\u2019.

It follows\nthat GCS cannot simply be characterised as containing a particular \u2018logic\u2019 of more\nor less transformative collective association, differentiated from the \u2018logic\u2019 of govern-\nment and authority on the one hand and that of economy on the other. As\nChandhoke has it, \u2018we can suggest with some justification that the much-vaunted\nautonomy of civil society is constrained from the word go\u2019.26\nGCS as voluntary associations\nThe second tenet of the GCS discourse upon which we would like to reflect is the\ntendency to equate GCS with the practices of voluntary associations. In short, GCS\nbecomes defined as voluntary association and vice versa. Descriptions of GCS in\nboth the documentation of the international organisations and scholarly work often\nread like a \u2018who\u2019s who\u2019 of NGOs and social movements, such that GCS becomes\nequivalent to what Pasha and Blaney call \u2018transnational associational life\u2019.27 Further-\nmore, the associational life of GCS also becomes privileged in normative terms.\nVoluntary associations in the space of GCS are viewed either as the legitimate form\nof politics through which to bring improved accountability to the institutions of\nglobal governance, or as the principal form of a progressive politics capable of\nchallenging and transforming the status quo. What concerns us, then, is the delimit-\ning consequences for politics of framing GCS as voluntary associations.\nThe common sense that equates GCS with voluntary associations is so omni-\npresent in the discourse that a couple of illustrative quotations should suffice. For\ninstance, for the Commission on Global Governance, the term GCS \n. . . covers a multitude of institutions, voluntary associations and networks \u2013 women\u2019s groups,\ntrade unions, chambers of commerce, farming or housing co-operatives, neighbourhood\nwatch associations, religion-based organizations, and so on.28\nSuch is the extent of the identification of GCS with voluntary organisations for the\nWorld Bank that they consistently refer to what they call \u2018civil society organis-\nations\u2019.29 Meanwhile, despite developing a more critical approach to GCS, leading\nIR\/IPE scholar of GCS Jan Aart Scholte engages in a not-dissimilar list-making\nexercise that suggests that:\n94 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n24 Pasha and Blaney, \u2018Elusive Paradise\u2019, p. 421.\n25 Craig N.

Civil society is therefore distinct from both\nofficial and commercial circles \u2026 civil society groups include academic institutes, community-\nbased organisations, consumer protection bodies, criminal syndicates, development\ncooperation groups, environmental campaigns, ethnic lobbies, charitable foundations,\nfarmers\u2019 groups, human rights advocates, labour unions, relief organisations, peace activists,\nprofessional bodies, religious institutions, women\u2019s networks, youth campaigns and more.30\nAs is the case with the tendency to represent GCS as a bounded space, the image\nof GCS as voluntary associations is not simply a consequence of attempts to merely\ndescribe changes in the global political economy. Rather, it is, at least in part, a\nreflection of the influence of particular theories of civil society in framing\ncontemporary conceptions. The ideas expressed in the nineteenth century by Alexis\nde Tocqueville on the workings of American democracy clearly loom large. For the\ninternational organisations in particular, de Tocqueville\u2019s conclusions as to the\ncentrality of voluntary associations to a healthy liberal democracy are by and large\ntransposed to the present in their policy prescriptions. This is as apparent, for\ninstance, in the World Bank\u2019s recommendations that assert the centrality of the\n\u2018social capital\u2019 supplied by civil society to economic development,31 as it is in the\nWTO\u2019s efforts to welcome the lobbying of NGOs.32 At the same time, the intel-\nlectual currents of thought that frame many academic accounts of GCS also\nencourage the representation of GCS as voluntary associations. It is far from\ncoincidental that academic interest in GCS has overlapped with a period of\nconstructive critical engagement with Marxism across the social sciences.33 The\nresulting neo-Marxism is apt to stress that \u2018the politics of civil society, articulated\nprimarily through new social movements, has superseded the politics of class\u2019.34\nCivil society is no longer viewed simply as synonymous with bourgeois capitalism,35\nbut is necessary to either bring capitalism under democratic control or to find a\nmore democratic means of economic organisation.36 The writings of Gramsci who,\ncontrary to Marx, was never willing to equate civil society with the bourgeoisie and\ninstead chose to emphasise a wide range of collective associations, have once again\nproved especially influential in this regard.\nIt is important to reinforce that for both the international organisations and\nacademic commentators, GCS as voluntary associations is regarded as a force for\nAmbiguities of global civil society 95\n30 Scholte, Globalization, p. 277.\n31 For detailed arguments that assert the importance of liberal civil society in supplying the collective\ncultural underpinnings for a successful market economy, see Francis Fukuyama, Trust: The Social\nVirtues and the Creation of Prosperity (New York: The Free Press, 1996), and Robert Putnam,\nBowling Alone (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2000).\n32 Rorden Wilkinson, \u2018Global Monitor: The World Trade Organization\u2019, New Political Economy, 7: 1\n(2002), p. 131\u20134.\n33 See, for example, Alain Lipietz, Mirages and Miracles: The Crisis of Global Fordism (London: Verso,\n1987); Robert W.

While understanding the utility of a well-developed civil society to the\ninternational organisations is fairly obvious given their neoliberal credentials and\nprescriptions, we have to turn to debates about the continuing relevance of Marxist\nthought to understand the celebration of the virtues of GCS in academic circles.\nJust as the proletariat is juxtaposed to the bourgeoisie under Marxism, many\nscholars of GCS position the \u2018good\u2019 of civil society against the \u2018bad\u2019 of state and\ncapital.37 Such is this trait in the discourse, also influenced by the experience of\nactivists during the 1980s in Eastern Europe, that GCS as voluntary association is\nenclosed further. For many of the leading IR\/IPE scholars, GCS no longer refers to\nthe bourgeoisie or even includes chambers of commerce and other associations of\ncapital.38 Rather, the space of GCS is an exclusive one, occupied by the associations\nand movements of labour, women, environmentalists and other \u2018good\u2019 causes. As\nCox claims, \u2018The concept has been appropriated by those who foresee an emancip-\natory role for civil society\u2019.39\nThere is, then, a strong contested normative dimension to GCS as voluntary\nassociations. The politics of world order is effectively fixed, with the associations of\ncivil society privileged in different ways from both the \u2018top-down\u2019 and from the\n\u2018bottom-up\u2019.40 From what is described as the \u2018top-down\u2019, the voluntary associations of\nGCS form the focal point upon which turns the vision of a global polity painted and\npractised by the international organisations.41 Voluntary associations here are in many\nways the signature of a civility that is brought to bear in global politics, resting upon\nthe principles of rights, plurality, legality, autonomy and freedom of association.\nEchoes of the liberal tradition of civil society are clear. The manner in which GCS as\nvoluntary associations comes at once to legitimate and delegitimate different forms of\npolitics in the contemporary global political economy is beginning to be recognised.\nFor instance, for Pasha and Blaney the \u2018notions of civility that are increasingly\nattached to civil society, while enabling a certain form of civil life, also contribute to a\nnarrowing of the political agenda and the exclusion of certain actors and voices\u2019.42\nMeanwhile, for Drainville, \u2018politics takes on the appearance of a collection of\nmanagerial problems to be solved and where the broad political attempt to settle a\nnew order goes unexamined\u2019.43 What has been less well recognised to date is that by\nadvocating the centrality of the \u2018good\u2019 voluntary associations of GCS as the key agent\nfor transformation, the so-called \u2018bottom-up\u2019 vision of a progressive global politics\nalso has delimiting consequences. The coherence of \u2018good\u2019 voluntary associations is\nassumed and the actual and potential importance of other forms of political practice\nare at best obscured, and at worst devalued. For instance, social movements can be\nseen to have \u2018\u2018\u2018dual faces\u201d which dialectically combine instrumental . . . demands with\nan expressive dimension orientated towards norms, values, identities, lifestyles, etc.\u2019.44\n96 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n37 Keane, \u2018Global Civil Society?\u2019, p. 30.\n38 See, for example, Falk, \u2018Global Civil Society\u2019; Cox, \u2018Civil Society at the Turn of the Millennium\u2019;\nScholte, Globalization.\n39 Cox, \u2018Civil Society at the Turn of the Millennium\u2019, p. 10.\n40 Ibid., p. 14.\n41 Drainville, \u2018The Fetishism of Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 39.\n42 Pasha and Blaney, \u2018Elusive Paradise\u2019, p. 423.\n43 Drainville, \u2018The Fetishism of Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 54.\n44 Neil Stammers, \u2018Social Movements and the Challenge to Power\u2019, in Martin Shaw (ed.), Politics and\nGlobalisation: Knowledge, Ethics and Agency (London: Routledge, 1999), p. 79.\nThe privileging of GCS as a space of voluntary associations risks overvaluing\ninstrumental political practices to the overall detriment of the progressive politics of\ntransformation.\nGCS as agent of empowerment\/resistance\nFor both its top-down and bottom-up proponents, the medley of voluntary move-\nments and organisations in GCS are, taken together, imagined as \u2018an autonomous\nand unambiguous agent\u2019.45 The autonomy of GCS rests upon the bounding of a\nspace of voluntary associations from states and other institutions of governance on\nthe one hand, and economy on the other. For Kaldor, for example, the defining\nfeature of \u201821st century\u2019 civil society is its \u2018transnational autonomy\u2019 from the war-\nmaking capabilities of the state.46 The unambiguous qualities of GCS arise from the\ntendency, present in both the documents of international organisations and the\nwritings of academic commentators, to represent the voluntary associations of GCS\nas a force for good. Here we reflect in detail, then, on the tenet of the discourse\nwhich suggests that GCS constitutes a \u2018good\u2019 agent for either empowerment or\nresistance. We are, in particular, concerned that GCS as agent of empowerment\/\nresistance overplays the consensual and coherent characteristics of GCS to the\nneglect of power relations, contradictions and tensions.\nGCS constitutes an agent for empowerment in a dual sense, enabling the political\nparticipation of GCS whilst authorising and legitimating the practices of the formal\ninstitutions of global governance. Perhaps not surprisingly, international\norganisations themselves are keen to invoke the assumed empowerment qualities of\nGCS. For example, the 1996 WTO Guidelines for arrangements on relations with\nNGOs clearly states that \u2018Members recognize the role NGOs can play to increase the\nawareness of the public in respect of WTO activities and agree in this regard to\nimprove transparency and develop communication with NGOs\u2019.47 Meanwhile, the\nUN\u2019s actions under the so-called Global Compact have sought to encourage\ncorporate social and environmental self-regulatory \u2018good practice\u2019 through a process\nof partnerships that includes major NGOs such as the World Wildlife Fund,\nAmnesty International and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.48\nAs the representatives of international organisations appear well aware, a nascent\nglobal polity necessarily entails not only the erosion of state sovereignty but also\nchallenges the efficacy of liberal democracy.49 They have effectively come to confront\na set of questions reminiscent of those asked by Machiavelli back in the sixteenth\ncentury \u2013 that is, how to forge the social basis necessary for new forms of political\nauthority.\nAmbiguities of global civil society 97\n45 Pasha and Blaney, \u2018Elusive Paradise\u2019, p. 425.\n46 Mary Kaldor, Global Civil Society: An Answer to War (Cambridge: Polity, 2003), p. 143.\n47 Cited in Wilkinson, \u2018Global Monitor\u2019, p. 133.\n48 See John Gerard Ruggie, \u2018global_governance.net: The Global Compact as Learning Network\u2019, Global\nGovernance, 7: 4 (2001), pp. 371\u20138.\n49 See David Held and Anthony McGrew, \u2018Globalization and the Liberal Democratic State\u2019,\nGovernment and Opposition, 28 (1993), pp. 261\u201385.\nThe conclusion that the voluntary associations of GCS, and not Machiavelli\u2019s\nPrince, should play the key role in empowerment has, however, not only been\nreached by the international organisations. While often critical of the unaccount-\nability of the institutions of global governance, many in the academic community\nhave also asserted the centrality of GCS to the making of a democratic global\npolity. The international campaigns and lobbying of an NGO like Greenpeace come\nto be seen as the exemplar of the democratising potential of GCS.50 In the first\ninstance the key task for the agent of GCS is \u2018about increasing the responsiveness of\npolitical institutions . . . the need to influence and put pressure on global institutions\nin order to reclaim control over local political space\u2019.51 As Scholte notes:\ncivil society activities can contribute to a democratic legitimation of the governance of\nglobalization. Authority is legitimate when stakeholders feel that governors have a right to\ngovern over them and that they, as citizens, have a duty to submit to the established rules.\nThere has been limited legitimacy in the governance of globalization to date. Most people\nhave accepted most policies towards global relations with passivity, ignorance and\nresignation. Yet if civil society offers stakeholders civic education, opportunities to speak, and\nchances to debate options, then people can begin to feel that they \u2018own\u2019 global politics and\npositively endorse its outputs. Such legitimacy not only renders governance more democratic;\nit also tends to make policies more viable.52\nFor many academic commentators, the capacity of GCS to successfully and meaning-\nfully empower the institutions of global governance requires that new forms of\ndemocratic participation are put in place. To return to Anheier et al., GCS is also\n\u2018about the radicalisation of democracy and the redistribution of political power\u2019.53\nRichard Falk talks, for instance, of the need to construct what he terms \u2018normative\ndemocracy\u2019. With clear parallels to David Held\u2019s work, Falk conceives of democracy\n\u2018as extending beyond constitutional and free, periodic elections to include an array\nof other assurances that governance is orientated toward human wellbeing and\necological sustainability, and that citizens have access to arenas of decision\u2019.54\nIt can be seen, then, that implicit in much of the academic advocacy of GCS is\nthe belief that by acting as a progressive force for \u2018good\u2019, GCS provides the key to\nresistance in the contemporary world order. While for the likes of Richard Falk this\nresistance hinges upon the establishment of more participatory and substantive\ndemocratic arrangements, others expect GCS to take the lead in a wider and perhaps\nultimately more emancipatory transformation. In the Gramscian terms of many of\nthese writers, civil society\u2019s organic intellectuals, including academics, church leaders,\ntrade unionists, environmentalists, social activists and leaders of community organis-\nations, are enacting a so-called counter-hegemonic war of position to establish a\n\u2018higher form of society\u2019.55 Whilst uncertain and far from determined, the qualities of\nsuch a society seem likely to combine equitable and environmentally sustainable\neconomic provisioning with a republican vision of democracy.\n98 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n50 Falk, \u2018Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 104\u20135.\n51 Anheier et al., \u2018Introducing Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 11.\n52 Scholte, Globalization, p. 278.\n53 Anheier et al., \u2018Introducing Global Civil Society\u2019, p.11.\n54 Falk, \u2018Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 106\u20137. See also David Held, Democracy and the Global Order: From\nthe Modern State to Cosmopolitan Governance (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1995).\n55 Cox, \u2018Civil Society at the Turn of the Millennium\u2019, p. 16.\nFor us, however, the representation of GCS as the \u2018good\u2019 agent for empowerment\/\nresistance remains highly problematic. Our concerns go beyond the observations of\nadvocates of GCS that achievements have been \u2018piecemeal\u2019 and \u2018disparate\u2019 to date,56\nor that in the emancipatory sense GCS remains \u2018something to be achieved\u2019.57 Rather,\nwe would seek to raise questions as to the coherent and consensual features of GCS\nthat, as a prerequisite for empowerment\/resistance, tend to be assumed. For us, civil\nsociety is constituted as much by the highly differentiated politics of power as it is by\nthe politics of empowerment and protest. Inequalities and conflicts abound. For\ninstance, we should recognise that the overtly neoliberal vision of GCS propagated\nby the international organisations \u2018is established after the image of the civilised\n(European) male individual\u2019 and \u2018rests on a foundation of excluded women, who are\nexpected to live under conditions of household despotism\u2019.58 At the same time, the\ncapacity of the voluntary associations of GCS to empower the formal institutions of\nglobal governance itself requires the prior provision and protection of basic rights of\nassociation that remain far from universal or pluralist. By way of example, Anheier\net al. draw our attention to fault lines in GCS between those that support or wish to\nreform, reject or find alternatives to globalisation.59 The liberal constitution of GCS,\nas currently practised by the international organisations, structurally privileges\nsupporters of globalisation and, at best, those NGOs seeking reform.\nSerious doubts also remain as to the representation of GCS as a \u2018good\u2019 agent for\nresistance. As already noted, the \u2018good\u2019 character of GCS is initially established by\nbanishing the associations of capital from the space of civil society, such that GCS\nbecomes \u2018something like a world proletariat in civvies\u2019.60 This contrasts with the\ncurrent situation in which the engagement between international organisations and\nvoluntary associations is by and large dominated by capital.61 Even if we can accept\nthat the associations of capital are not part of an emancipatory GCS, questions still\nremain as to the assumed consensus amongst labour, environmentalists, women\u2019s\ngroups and so on. This \u2018good\u2019 consensus, perceived to reflect a common opposition\nto neoliberalism, is far from assured. As Cox admits, a lack of consensus could leave\nthe way clear for what he calls the \u2018dark forces\u2019 of the extreme right, terrorists,\norganised crime and the intelligence services to enjoy further \u2018covert power\u2019.62 In\nsum, we would contend that the representation of GCS as actual and potential agent\nof resistance may actually divert our attention from the very power relations that we\nwould seek to explore and question.\nGlobal civil society reconsidered\nIn the first section of this article we have explored what we consider to be the\ndominant mode of knowledge in the contemporary framing of GCS. By positioning\nAmbiguities of global civil society 99\n56 Falk, \u2018Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 105\u20136\n57 Cox, \u2018Civil Society at the Turn of the Millennium\u2019, p. 11.\n58 Keane, Civil Society and the State, p. 21.\n59 Anheier et al., \u2018Introducing Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 7.\n60 Keane, \u2018Global Civil Society?\u2019, p. 29.\n61 O\u2019Brien et al., Contesting Global Governance.\n62 Cox, \u2018Civil Society at the Turn of the Millennium\u2019, p. 13\u201315.\nGCS as a non-governmental and non-market domain, constituted through voluntary\nassociation and resulting in an empowering and progressive force for good, this\nrepresentation tells us \u2018what GCS is\u2019 and, importantly, what it is not. Given IR\/IPE\u2019s\npredilection for identifiable and bounded agents within clearly defined structures of\npower, the more subtle and contradictory voices and actions of other groups have\noften become obscured.63 Our purpose in this section is to begin to draw together\nfrom diverse sources an alternative framing of GCS. The different strands of inquiry\nexplored here have in common an emphasis on power and, specifically, on the\nintricate and intractable relationship between power and knowledge. Our knowledge\nof what GCS may constitute is understood to be inseparable from the power that is\nexercised through the framing of, for example, mechanisms of global governance. To\nthink differently about the existence of a GCS, then, is to open up the possibility for\nalternative forms of politics. Drawing on a number of concrete examples of what we\nmay call civil society practices, we intend to show that such alternative forms of\npolitics are, indeed, already present, though obscured from view by the search for a\nparticular kind of responsible and \u2018civil\u2019 global agency.\nFrom a non-governmental space to a means of governing\nThe orthodox understanding of GCS, as we have suggested in this article, embodies\na particular view of what it means \u2018to govern\u2019 and \u2018to be governed\u2019. Government is a\nfunction that is held to rest with formal institutions \u2013 governments, international\norganisations and so on. James Rosenau and Ernst-Otto Czempiel\u2019s established\nargument that world affairs have shifted from a system of government to governance\nretains the notion that to govern is to provide the institutionalised norms and\nframeworks for action.64 A GCS, then, is necessary to provide accountability in a\nsystem of global governance. As a so-called third sphere of non-governmental\npolitics, GCS is celebrated because it is seen as outside government. We wish to\nbring our concern with power relations to front and centre by reconsidering GCS as\nprecisely a site of government \u2013 as a place where the global political economy is\nshaped, regulated or deregulated, disciplined or sustained. In this alternative framing\nof GCS as a discursive means of governing, of making people and their actions\ngovernable, we find the potential to challenge ascribed boundaries of state\/civil\nsociety and public\/private, and to highlight the ambiguities of GCS. If we are to\nmeaningfully open up the possibilities of a transformative GCS we must recognise\nthat it simultaneously holds out the potential for resistance, while it closes down,\nexcludes, controls and disciplines.\nMichel Foucault\u2019s writing offers us a conception of government and governability\nthat refutes conventionally held dichotomising assumptions about state and civil\nsociety. Governmentality, as he termed it, is \u2018the ensemble formed by the institutions,\n100 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n63 See Roger Tooze and Craig Murphy, \u2018Poverty of Epistemology in IPE: Mystery, Blindness, and\nInvisibility\u2019, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 25:3 (1996), pp. 681\u2013707; Craig Murphy,\n\u2018Seeing Women, Recognising Gender, Recasting International Relations\u2019, International Organization,\n50:3 (1996), pp. 513\u2013538.\n64 James Rosenau and Ernst-Otto Czempiel, Governance Without Government: Order and Change in\nprocedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics, that allow the\nexercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target\npopulation\u2019.65 The act of government, then, is not something undertaken by institu-\ntions and individuals holding power over society. Rather, governmentality permits\ngovernment from a distance, just as the global governance doctrines prescribe.\nCommenting on the relevance of Foucault\u2019s work to what he calls \u2018neoliberal\nsubjects\u2019, Nikolas Rose depicts the kind of government that can exist through the\nmentalities of individuals and groups:\nAn enabling state that will govern without governing \u2018society\u2019 \u2013 governing by acting on the\nchoices and self-steering properties of individuals, families, communities, organizations. This\nentails a twin process of autonomization plus responsibilization \u2013 opening free space for the\nchoices of individual actors whilst enwrapping these autonomized actors within new forms of\ncontrol .66\nThe implications of the governmentality thesis for the contemporary discourse of\nGCS are, in our view, of great significance. For instance, in his Foucauldian study of\ncivil society associations in the UK, John Morison uncovers a \u2018new breed of\nprofessionalized, well-funded, and well-organized voluntary associations\u2019 who \u2018use\nthe language of risk and reward, choice, economic rationality, targeting and output\nas the governing concepts\u2019.67 Focusing similar attention on transnational civil society,\nAndr\u00e9 Drainville points to the \u2018double attempt to construct global civil society and\nsettle with it the terms of transnational civility\u2019.68 Exploring what he terms \u2018trans-\nnational subjects\u2019 through the Quebec City protests of 2001, he understands the\ntwinning of heads of states\u2019 Summits and People\u2019s Summits as an \u2018attempt to create\na responsible hemispheric civil society\u2019 within which resistance becomes compliance.69\nUnder orthodox neoliberal conceptions of GCS as a bounded non-governmental\npublic space, most personal questions of how one should live and who one should\naspire to be are deemed to be private and are effectively depoliticised. The\ngovernmentality lens on GCS has the effect of repoliticising private individual\nambitions, perceptions and experiences as these are brought into networks of power.\nThe membership of an environmental group, for example, becomes tied to the\ncitizen as a responsible consumer and draws on numerous lifestyle habits and\nchoices \u2013 from fair-trade cappuccinos to \u2018anti-sweatshop\u2019 T-shirts.\nThe practices of global civil society, it seems to us, cannot be decisively situated in\na bounded space that is \u2018non-governmental\u2019 and \u2018non-economic\u2019. In the World\nBank\u2019s framing of civil society, for example, local networks and voluntary associ-\nations become a means to mitigate the more damaging forces of the global economy.\nUnder the heading \u2018what is civil society?\u2019, their website represents voluntary\nassociations as sources of social capital that can, alongside state and market,\nAmbiguities of global civil society 101\nWorld Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992).\n65 Michel Foucault, \u2018On Governmentality\u2019, Ideology and Consciousness, 6 (1979), p. 20.\n66 Nikolas Rose, Governing the Soul: The Shaping of the Private Self (London: Free Association Books,\n1999 [1989]), p. xxiii.\n67 John Morison, \u2018The Government-Voluntary Sector Compacts: Governance, Governmentality, and\nCivil Society\u2019, Journal of Law and Society, 27:1 (2000), p. 109.\n68 Drainville, \u2018The Fetishism of Global Civil Society\u2019, p. 46.\n69 Andre Drainville, \u2018Quebec City 2001 and the Making of Transnational Subjects\u2019, Socialist Register\n(2002), p. 27.\n\u2018contribute jointly to the provision of welfare and economic development\u2019.70 Offering\nthe examples of local credit networks and rural organisations, the concept of civil\nsociety is tied to the responsibilities of individuals and groups to take \u2018the oppor-\ntunity to participate\u2019 in development and social welfare. In the World Development\nReport Attacking Poverty, the Bank makes its use of GCS as a means of governing\nmore explicit. In their guidelines on \u2018helping poor people to manage risk\u2019 they\ndescribe microfinance as a \u2018risk management tool\u2019 that can \u2018help poor households\nsmooth consumption during an adverse shock\u2019.71 Though the report refers to NGOs\nsuch as the Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA), HomeNet, and Women in\nInformal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), the participation of\nthese groups is understood to be the responsible and proactive obligation of global\ncitizens. The critical voices that these groups bring to the inequalities of the global\neconomy are masked by a discourse of \u2018harnessing global forces\u2019 and providing\nchannels for legitimate participation that enable poor people to \u2018get the best\u2019 from\nglobalisation.\nWe are not suggesting that GCS is simply synonymous with the governing of the\nlatest (neoliberal, global) stage of bourgeois capitalism, far from it. Rather, spaces of\nGCS should be treated as ambiguous, open to contestation and often contradictory.\nThe roles of civil society groups in relation to the governance of the global political\neconomy are, more often than not, undecidable. Organisations may simultaneously\nappear to offer coping mechanisms for dealing with globalisation (in effect, plugging\nthe gaps left by the global economy), while also offering a substantive critique of the\nstructures of global finance and production. Indeed, NGOs may themselves debate\nand negotiate the terms of their role in advocacy networks and partnerships,\nacknowledging the tensions and contradictions in their own activities to such an extent\nthat their intra-institutional organisation divorces their role in service-delivery from\ntheir advocacy work.72 A further example can be found in local exchange trading\nsystems (LETS). On the one hand, LETS are widely understood to be voluntary\nassociations that have emerged as a response to the exclusionary consequences of\nfinancial globalisation.73 Yet, on the other hand, their relationship to the politics of\nglobal financial exclusion is thoroughly ambiguous. In one sense, they are \u2018self help\u2019\nassociations that also campaign for change in global finance. In another sense, the\npractices of LETS appeal to criteria of trust and responsibility that are not dissimilar\nfrom those applied to individuals by mainstream financial institutions. While we agree\nthat LETS are interesting and potentially transformative sites within specific locales,\nwe also emphasise their ambivalence \u2013 they cannot be isolated from state, market, or\nthe existing exclusions of mainstream finance. For us, the contested and contradictory\nmaking of neoliberal or transnational subjectivities, furthered by the global gover-\nnance discourse, is part of a wider network of production, consumption and familial\npractices that criss-cross ascribed public and private domains.\n102 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n70 See <www.worldbank.org\/poverty\/scapital>\n71 World Bank, \u2018Attacking Poverty\u2019, World Development Report (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n2000\/01), p. 156.\n72 Interview with development NGO official, July 2002.\n73 Eric Helleiner, \u2018Think Globally, Transact Locally: Green Political Economy and the Local Currency\nMovement\u2019, paper presented at the 39th International Studies Association Annual Convention,\nFebruary 1998, Washington DC; M.

Yet,\nmany of the habits of traditional IR\/IPE inquiry remain in place: the tendency to\nlook for identifiable and atomised agents, a focus on institutions as fixed structures\nof political life, and the separation of levels of analysis as though these were actually\nclearly delineated in everyday life. In some senses the concept of a GCS always\nappears in relation to a sovereign state or international organisation,75 a named list\nof institutions with clear membership constituencies, and a spectrum of activity\nfrom \u2018transnational\u2019 to \u2018grassroots\u2019. For Rob Walker, \u2018social movements are, to the\nmodern political imagination, most easily fixed within a sphere of social life that is\ndistinguished from and even counterposed to the sphere of politics \u2013 within the so-\ncalled civil society\u2019.76 Taken together with Appadurai\u2019s observations, this suggests\nnot that we take our eyes off civil society movements or necessarily deny the\npotential of a transformative GCS, but that we think of them as unbounded, fluid,\nand mobile political sites. In contrast to fixed and named associations, we then see a\nsphere of social life whose boundaries and membership are contested. Rather than\nan elite world of policymaking that is counterposed to local and grassroots struggle,\nwe see what Walker terms \u2018the transgression of these fine lines\u2019.77 The politics of\nmovements thus shifts from the identification of a fixed association or NGO to an\nacknowledgement of the ability to confound boundaries that is their very essence.\nIt is not unusual for an institution or organisation to claim to be speaking on\nbehalf of, or with the mandate of, GCS. To explore an example, there is increasing\ninterest in the idea that organised labour may be, in the broadest sense, represent-\native of the interests of civil society. Juan Somavia, Director General of the ILO,\nconsiders organised labour to be an institution of GCS, with transnational unions\nbeing \u2018the most organised actors and the most articulate voices in society\u2019.78 It is\nheld that the challenges posed to labour by globalisation and the restructuring of\nproduction are shared by civil society more widely, and that the trade unions\nrepresent the most effective channel for communicating those interests. Put simply,\neffective politics is understood to reside with formalised associations that have a\nclear mandate. Alliances between trade unions and NGOs have been celebrated by a\nliterature that documents the rise of a \u2018global social movement unionism\u2019 that\nAmbiguities of global civil society 103\n74 Arjun Appadurai, \u2018Grassroots Globalization and the Research Imagination\u2019, in Appadurai (ed.),\nGlobalization (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2001).\n75 O\u2019Brien et al., Contesting Global Governance, for example, assess the significance of new social\nmovements in world politics in terms of their ability to influence the agendas of international\nfinancial institutions.\n76 R.B.J Walker, \u2018Social Movements\/World Politics\u2019, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 23:3\n(1994), p. 670.\n77 R.B.J Walker, \u2018Social Movements\/World Politics\u2019, p. 700.\n78 Juan Somavia, \u2018Trade Unions in the 21st Century\u2019, Keynote Speech (Geneva: ILO, 1999).\ntranscends the narrow concerns of organised labour.79 This tendency to name\nassociations or movements as vehicles for GCS serves to fix the politics of work and\nlabour as something that is the preserve of trade unions and NGOs. The experiences\nof unprotected workers, or indeed the unemployed, are exposed only via inter-\nmediary agencies that claim to speak on their behalf.\nIf we reconsider the agency of workers and worker groups, focusing on the\nmobile and contested nature of movements, we can begin to problematise the idea\nthat formalised trade unions speak on behalf of workers as a collective body. The\ncontemporary politics of movement within and across workplaces is as much about\n\u2018involuntary\u2019 and unplanned \u2018reflex\u2019 action, what James Scott would call \u2018infra-\npolitics\u2019,80 as it is \u2018voluntary\u2019 and strategic action. Many of the struggles labelled\n\u2018grassroots\u2019, such as plant-level industrial action or everyday \u2018footdragging\u2019 and acts\nof disruption, are actually central to the politics of work and confound attempts to\nlimit this to a global social movement unionism. Maria Soldatenko\u2019s studies of\nLatina garment workers in Los Angeles, for example, emphasise the intra-worker\nand inter-ethnic conflict within sweatshop conditions. This problematises the\ntreatment of workers as a collective body and exposes the difficulties of trying to\n\u2018forge an effective culture of resistance\u2019.81 It is not to say that collective identities\nand resistances cannot emerge in such environments, but rather to highlight the\nshifts and political struggles that define the nature of the resistance. To illustrate\nfurther, in Bread and Roses, Ken Loach\u2019s cinematic portrayal of life as an\nundocumented Mexican cleaner in Los Angeles, Rosa voices her contempt for the\nAmerican unions that claim to represent her interests. Supporting her family\nthrough prostitution and cleaning work, she asks her white, college-educated union\nrepresentative, \u2018what do you risk?\u2019, challenging his \u2018justice for janitors\u2019 campaign\nwith an appeal for \u2018justice for Rosa\u2019. In response to the union\u2019s collective \u2018we\u2019, Rosa\nreplies \u2018don\u2019t say we, there is never we, only I\u2019.82 Again, we do not suggest the\nimpossibility of multiple \u2018I\u2019s\u2019 becoming \u2018we\u2019, and indeed Loach\u2019s film reveals this\npossibility. Rather, we wish both to expose the problem of ascribing \u2018responsible\u2019\nand \u2018civil\u2019 identities to people by virtue of their exclusion, and to acknowledge the\ntensions and personal losses that accompany the making of solidarity.\nWhen labour organisations claim to speak on behalf of a collective \u2018we\u2019 they avert\ntheir gaze, not only from the experiences of workers at the margins of the global\npolitical economy, but also from the \u2018silent resistances\u2019 that characterise the politics\nof displaced and excluded peoples.83 Beneath the surface of an emergent GCS lie\n104 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n79 Robert O\u2019Brien, \u2018Workers and World Order: The Tentative Transformation of the International\nUnion Movement\u2019, Review of International Studies, 26:4 (2000), pp. 533\u201356; Peter Waterman and Jane\nWills, \u2018Introduction: Space, Place and the New Labour Internationalisms: Beyond the Fragments\u2019,\nAntipode, 33:3 (2001), pp. 305\u2013311.\n80 James C.

The problem, of course, is that things are rarely so\nstraightforward in the concrete practices of organisation and resistance. It is not\npossible to reduce power to a named group, institution or actor, as many seeking to\nmap out a GCS would wish to do. Civil society groups or movements do not simply\n\u2018rise up\u2019 to challenge the power of global markets, they do not unambiguously resist\nbecause they are always also intricately involved in the very production of that\npower:\nPower is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed\nwith; it is the name one attributes to a complex strategical relationship in a particular\nsociety.85\nOur attention is directed to the ways in which power functions and is exercised\nthrough civil society groups, and to the inequalities and exclusions that are\nproduced. As collective agents, global civil society networks are themselves inscribed\nwith the power relations found in the states, markets, and organisations they seek to\nchallenge. We would agree, then, with John MacLean who reminds us that to reduce\nour search for transformative \u2018agency\u2019 to the identification of collective \u2018agents\u2019 leads\nto a misrepresentation of politics and power relations.86 Trade unions, universities,\nthe media, and church organisations are all historical sites of civil society uprising,\nbut they are simultaneously spaces of representation, exclusion and control. The\npolitics of GCS is, thus, running with contradictions, and constantly in flux \u2013 a\nmovement that is not always in the direction of emancipatory \u2018civility\u2019.\nWe wish to emphasise here three aspects of GCS that become visible if we cease\nthe search for the consolidated agent for \u2018good\u2019 and recognise the agitative and\ncontradictory nature of what it means to be \u2018civil\u2019. First, within a named and\nassumed civil society grouping there are tensions surrounding \u2018who\u2019 is being\nempowered, or \u2018what\u2019 is being resisted. To deny these tensions in a search for a\nsingle galvanising manifesto or agenda is to miss the very heart of the politics of\nAmbiguities of global civil society 105\n84 David Campbell, \u2018Political Prosaics, Transversal Politics, and the Anarchical World\u2019, in M.

In his discussion of the popular dissent leading to the East\nGerman revolution, Roland Bleiker significantly problematises the image of a civil\nsociety movement that empowers its members and rewards their participation:\nDespite their unusually active participation in the protest movement, East German women\nsuffered disproportionately from the subsequent process of unification. For them the\ndemocratic dawn ushered in drastic setbacks in such realms as reproductive rights, access to\nday care or employment opportunities. A revived civil society, which identifies men with the\npublic and women with the private sphere, further increased the masculinist character of\npost-Wall German politics.87\nParticipation in voluntary civil society activity cannot, in and of itself, be\nunderstood to empower and emancipate. \u2018Discursively entrenched power relations\u2019,\nBleiker writes, \u2018cannot simply be toppled by mass demonstrations or other trans-\nversal practices of dissent\u2019.88 The ability to transgress political boundaries, to\norganise transnationally and even to achieve democratic transformation, does not\nnecessarily and always challenge entrenched forms of domination and exclusion. It\nmay even deepen them. As Pasha and Blaney have it, \u2018transnational associational life\ndoes not so readily transcend contemporary contradictions and oppressions\u2019.89 We\nare not suggesting that there is no potential for a transformative GCS sphere, but\nrather that it cannot be understood as unambiguously made by individual actors\nrationally pooling their interests to secure the optimal outcome. Despite the claims\nmade about \u2018social capital\u2019, the political outcomes can never be clear-cut, and the\nobjectives may never be fully met. As is exemplified particularly well by women\u2019s\nmovements in former Communist Europe, the achievement of apparent success in\npolitical transformation can be built on the back of gendered practices that displace\nrisks onto women and migrant workers. The terms of reference of a civil society\nmovement for change cannot avoid dealing with the very exclusions it seeks to\noppose, and may indeed carry them into an otherwise transformed order.\nSecond, the assumption of GCS as a cohesive and empowered agent masks the\ncontradictions of people\u2019s feelings of shared experience, personal wellbeing and\nperceptions of risk and reward. Within existing conceptions of GCS, do we have\nways of thinking about the individual who is a member of Amnesty International\nwhile simultaneously holding portfolio investments in a number of large\nmultinational corporations; the alliance between the United Nations World Food\nProgramme and Benetton\u2019s advertising campaigns; the Visa cardholder who joins\nReclaim the Streets; or the report from the Seattle protests that asked: \u2018did the\nprotester who was filmed kicking lumps off the Nike sign while wearing Nike shoes\nsee the irony?\u2019.90 For it is in such contradictory relationships with the global political\neconomy that we all find ourselves. Arjun Appadurai captures just such a contra-\ndiction when he asks how we can begin to understand the disjuncture of:\nIdeas about gender and modernity that circulate to create large female workforces at the same\ntime that cross-national ideologies of \u2018culture\u2019, \u2018authenticity\u2019, and national honour put\n106 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n87 Roland Bleiker, Popular Dissent, Human Agency and Global Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2000), p. 34.\n88 Bleiker, Popular Dissent, p. 170.\n89 Pasha and Blaney, \u2018Elusive Paradise\u2019, p. 431.\n90 Larry Elliott, \u2018Unless WTO Cleans up its Act There Will be More Issues for the Protesters to Trade\nOn\u2019, The Guardian, 6 December (1999).\nincreasing pressure on various communities to morally discipline just those working women\nwho are vital to emerging markets and manufacturing sites.91\nIt is these \u2018dark sides\u2019 of civil society activity that are so often invisible within\ndiscourses of empowerment\/resistance in global governance. Just as some move-\nments organise to challenge the boundaries that confine and restrict the movement\nof people, images and ideas, for example, others campaign precisely to close them\ndown, to secure their own sense of belonging. There are currently, for example,\nvoluntary associations springing up in the English countryside to campaign against\nplanned asylum accommodation centres. Such groups make appeals to the threat to\ntheir own community in order to exclude migrant peoples, with one group arguing\nthat their proximity to a prison and an army base means that they are already\nsubject to \u2018outside\u2019 threats. Indeed, even within a single protest we find some groups\nsecuring their own identity by criminalising others, for example consumer activist\ncampaigners on the steps of Niketown in Seattle assisting the police in the\nidentification and arrest of anarchists.92 In these instances the empowerment of civil\nsociety associations is pursued through the disempowerment of others, and the\nidentity of a collective body is secured through the production of insecurity for\nothers.\nFinally, and a related point, we wish to emphasise again the unsettled and\ncontested nature of an emergent GCS. As William Connolly has argued, \u2018a\nconventional pluralist celebrates diversity within settled contexts of conflict and\ncollective action\u2019.93 To borrow his framing of the problem, it is our view that the\nconventional theorist of GCS celebrates diversity and difference within settled,\ndefined and clearly delimited boundaries. In contrast, we ask how these boundaries\ncome to be settled and contribute to what we would describe as GCS as a means of\ngoverning. It is the very mapping and contesting of the boundaries of GCS that we\nfeel should receive greater attention in GCS research. To illustrate our point we will\ndraw on Naomi Klein\u2019s \u2018anti-corporate\u2019 movement because it looms large in the\npublic imagination of what it means to be resisting the forces of globalisation.\nEstablished through Klein\u2019s columns in Toronto\u2019s The Globe and Mail and her\nfirst book No Logo, the no logo campaigns have seemed to be the epitome of an\nopen, mobile and multi-issue movement.94 Indeed, Klein herself notes that, \u2018rather\nthan a single movement, what is emerging is thousands of movements intricately\nlinked to one another, much as \u201chotlinks\u201d connect their websites on the Internet\u2019.95\nYet, Klein is also keen to settle the common context within which these movements\noperate, arguing that they are \u2018not demonstrations of one movement but conver-\ngences of many smaller ones\u2019. The grounds for convergence are established as a\ncommon foe, an identifiable set of forces that all participants are \u2018against\u2019. \u2018Look a\nlittle closer\u2019, she tells us, \u2018and it\u2019s clear that these smaller, targeted movements are\nAmbiguities of global civil society 107\n91 Appadurai, \u2018Grassroots Globalization\u2019, p. 6.\n92 Drainville, \u2018Quebec City\u2019, p. 31.\n93 William Connolly, The Ethos of Pluralization (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press,\n1995), p. xiii.\n94 Naomi Klein, No Logo (London: Flamingo, 2000).\n95 Naomi Klein, \u2018Farewell to the \u201cEnd of History\u201d: Organization and Vision in Anti-Corporate\nMovements\u2019, Socialist Register (2002), p. 4.\nindeed battling the same forces\u2019.96 It seems that Klein does, after all, wish to\nestablish a settled context for the conflicts of diverse movements. A close study of\nher website indicates a much more fiercely contested terrain on which the grounds\nfor collective action are fought out.97 As a self-proclaimed \u2018critic both of the Israeli\noccupation and of corporate-dictated globalization\u2019, Klein states that \u2018the globaliz-\nation movement isn\u2019t anti-Semitic, it just hasn\u2019t fully confronted the implications of\ndiving into the Middle East conflict\u2019.98 Again, there is an attempt to find some\n\u2018convergence\u2019, this time between the Israeli occupation and the actions of MNCs,\nand Klein finds the answer in \u2018self-determination: the right of people everywhere to\ndecide how best to organize their societies and economies\u2019. The potential diversity of\nGCS\u2019s political struggles is squeezed into a mould that conforms with the settled\nview of how things should be.\nFor us, Klein\u2019s desire to define the grounds for the movement\u2019s position, amidst a\nstorm of protest in the chat room that followed, demonstrates exactly what Klein\nseems to deny: the contested nature of GCS as a platform for diverse political\nstruggles. It is the perpetual struggle to define the terms of the movements that, in\nlarge part, constitutes the politics of GCS. As the anti-corporate movement again\nredefines its purpose with the inclusion of \u2018solidarity with refugees\u2019, rather than look\nfor a convergence or a \u2018common threat\u2019, we point to this as the essence of GCS\nmovements \u2013 the constant metamorphosis, fracturing, and dissent. Just as Klein\nseeks to respond to state and corporate attempts to govern the parameters of her\nmovement, so she herself attempts to establish the governmental grounds for the\nfuture legitimacy of that movement.\nConcluding remarks\nWe began this article by commenting on the relationship between academic discus-\nsions about what GCS might be and the challenges posed by \u2018real\u2019 world events. It is\nnot that September 11th represents an unprecedented watershed in IR, but rather\nthat it is one instance among many of a provocation to our dominant modes of\nknowledge. Our approaches to understanding GCS will cast light on some of the\ndynamics of contemporary world politics, while they leave others in deep shadow. In\nthis way the discourse of GCS constrains and delimits the possibilities for the\ndiscussion and practice of global politics. For Mary Kaldor, for example, \u2018the\nattacks on September 11th can be understood as an attack on the basic assumptions\nof global civility\u2019.99 Yet, presumably they can also be understood as the result of the\nfailure of that \u2018global civility\u2019 to consider those who are excluded or positioned\noutside its terms. Responses to September 11th in the form of the \u2018war on terror\u2019\nhave come to rely precisely upon the maintenance of such binaries as good\/evil,\n108 Louise Amoore and Paul Langley\n96 Klein, \u2018Farewell to the End of History\u2019, p. 4.\n97 See <www.nologo.og>\n98 Naomi Klein, \u2018Sharon, Le Pen and anti-Semitism\u2019, <www.nologo.org\/article.pl?sid=02\/04\/24\/1319201>\n99 Kaldor, Global Civil Society, p. 148.\ncivilised\/uncivilised, legitimate\/illegitimate politics.100 Yet, to look beyond these\nbinaries is to see that the lines cannot be drawn so easily. The police storming of the\nLondon Finsbury Park mosque in 2003, for example, has revealed that a space of\nreligious, civil, and voluntary association embodies multiple and apparently contra-\ndictory social and political practices. Similarly, in January 2002, the first female\nPalestinian \u2018suicide bomber\u2019 was revealed to be a 28 year-old paramedic volunteer-\ning for the Red Crescent. A final example of the contradictory practices of GCS is\noffered by Marieke de Goede who argues that attempts by the Financial Action\nTask Force (FATF) to close down terrorist finances runs up against multiple uses of\n\u2018underground\u2019 Hawala finance \u2013 including by development groups and migrant\nworkers.101 The question then becomes whether we wish to sustain assumptions\nabout legitimate, civil and emancipatory politics on the one hand, and illegitimate,\nuncivil and extremist politics on the other, or whether we wish to enquire into their\nsimultaneous presence, their contradictions and tensions.\nAt one level, then, constraints are imposed on critical enquiry by the specific\nneoliberal representations of responsible and civil subjects, such as those furthered\nby the major international organisations. We would characterise such a represent-\nation of civil society as part of a neoliberal means of governing that disciplines and\nexcludes those who do not conform. It has been the portrayal of GCS as a bounded\nspace of \u2018non-government\u2019, common to the international organisations and some\nacademic commentaries, that has tended to obscure the very \u2018governing\u2019 qualities of\nGCS to date. Yet, to an extent, critical academic accounts of GCS that focus their\nattention on the capacity of social movements to counter neoliberal globalisation\nalso neglect to recognise the consequences of their reading for global politics. Whilst\nthe emancipatory potential of GCS is celebrated, the manner in which this assumed\ntransformative capacity is itself open to challenge and contradiction is not explored.\nIn our view, to continue the search for a particular kind of responsible, legitimate\nand civil global agency is to avert our gaze from the power relations and con-\ntestation that lie at the heart of a politicised reading of GCS.\nSo, what would a more politicised GCS research agenda look like? For us it would\nbe wary of the search for a consolidated GCS, and would treat with caution claims\nto a fully fleshed-out map of contemporary GCS. Rather, it would attend to the\nmodes of knowledge, dominant discourses and practices that have brought GCS\ninto common currency. To refuse to definitively pin down GCS, and to focus instead\non what is done in its name, is also to foreground the interplay between our theories\nand concepts and empirical research. Better understanding is needed, not only of\nhow the GCS discourse is produced and operates concretely across and within\nparticular institutional settings (such as international organisations and NGOs), but\nalso of how it is translated and redefined at the level of situated experience. It is in\nthe everyday realms of familial, associational, religious or cultural life, for example,\nAmbiguities of global civil society 109\n100 For further discussion see James der Derian, \u2018In Terrorem: Before and After 9\/11\u2019, in Ken Booth and\nTim Dunne, Worlds in Collision: Terror and the Future of Global Order (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002),\npp. 101\u201317.\n101 Marieke de Goede, \u2018Hawala Discourses and the War on Terrorist Finance\u2019, Environment and Planning\nD: Society and Space, 21 (forthcoming, 2003).\nthat GCS receives its concrete context.
