WOODROFFE1, BEN P. HORTON2, PIERS LARCOMBE3 AND JOHN E. WHITTAKER4\nABSTRACT\nContemporary foraminiferal samples and environ-\nmental information were collected from three fringing\nmangrove environments (Sandfly Creek Transect 1 and\n2, and Cocoa Creek) in Cleveland Bay, and an estuarine\nmangrove environment (Saunders Creek) in Halifax\nBay, on the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) coastline,\nAustralia, to elucidate the relationship of the foraminif-\neral assemblages with the environment. The data sup-\nport the vertical zonation concept, which suggests that\nthe distribution of foraminifera in the intertidal zone is\nusually a direct function of elevation, with the duration\nand frequency of subaerial exposure as the most impor-\ntant factor. An agglutinated foraminiferal assemblage\ndominated by Miliammina fusca, Trochammina inflata,\nAmmotium directum and Haplophragmoides sp. exists at\nthe landward edge of the field sites, in a zone between\njust above Mean Low Water of Neap Tides to Highest\nAstronomical Tide level (a vertical range of 1.8 m). In\naddition, a foraminiferal assemblage dominated by Am-\nmonia aoteana is found at all sites, existing between just\nbelow Mean Low Water of Neap Tides and Mean High\nWater of Neap Tides (a vertical range of 0.8 m). These\nassemblages may be used to reconstruct sea level from\nfossil cores from the area.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe study of Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) changes\nin the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region of Australia is par-\nticularly important because of its tectonic stability and its\ngreat distance from the centers of former ice caps. Obser-\nvations of sea-level change in far field locations such as\nAustralia provide the most direct estimate of the volume of\ngrounded ice existing at various time periods between the\nLast Glacial Maximum and present (Milne and others,\n2002). In addition, evidence of a mid-Holocene high stand\nof approximately 13 m along parts of the east coast of\nAustralia and the nature of subsequent RSL fall is of interest\nto geophysical modelers because it yields information on\nthe contribution of hydro-isostasy, equatorial ocean siphon-\ning and crustal levering to late Holocene relative sea-level\nchange in tropical areas. This increases our understanding\nof solid earth geophysics (e.g., Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991;\n1 Department of Geography, University of Durham, South Road,\nDurham, DH1 3LE, UK. E-mail: S.A.Woodroffe@durham.ac.uk\n2 Department of Earth and Environmental Science, University of\nPennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104-6316, USA.\n3 Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Pak-\nefield Road, Lowestoft, Suffolk, NR33 0HT, UK.\n4 Micropalaeontology Research, Department of Palaeontology, The\nNatural History Museum, London SW7 5BD, UK.\nNakada and Lambeck, 1989; Yokoyama and others, 2001;\nLambeck and others, 2002).\nOne approach to the study of RSL change is to use mi-\ncrofossil sea-level indicators such as foraminifera, diatoms\nand pollen, which are contained in both contemporary and\nfossil sedimentary deposits. Sea-level indicators developed\nfrom observed changes in microfossil assemblages have\nbeen used for the past 30 years or so to provide reconstruc-\ntions of Holocene RSL change for many areas, including\nBritain, Europe and North America, and have been the pri-\nmary source of data for developing and testing models of\nRSL change (e.g., Shennan and others, 2002; Peltier, 2002;\nShennan and Horton, 2002). Marsh foraminifera, in partic-\nular, are highly accurate sea-level indicators because they\nhave narrow ecological tolerances and narrow vertical zones\nin the intertidal zone (Scott and Medioli, 1978, 1980a).\nHowever, all microfossil data and their associated RSL re-\nconstructions are subject to errors, which limit the precision\nof determining both age and elevation, and as smaller mag-\nnitude sea-level changes are analyzed, the magnitude of er-\nrors becomes increasingly important. To address this limi-\ntation we must use the most precise indicators available, and\nuse statistically robust quantitative techniques in reconstruc-\ntions.\nTo this end, a new generation of microfossil-based quan-\ntitative paleoenvironmental reconstructions has been devel-\noped (e.g., Horton, 1999; Zong and Horton, 1999; Edwards\nand Horton, 2000; Gehrels and others, 2001; Horton and\nothers, 2003), allowing a relatively precise reconstruction of\nformer sea levels, using a statistically-based relationship be-\ntween contemporary foraminiferal assemblages, their rela-\ntionships to sea level and their fossil counterparts. This de-\nveloping research field is generating high precision in RSL\nreconstructions (Horton and others, 2000; Edwards and Hor-\nton, 2000; Horton and Edwards, 2005; Sawai and others,\n2004).\nIn contrast to mid-latitude, temperate environments, there\nhave been relatively few studies of intertidal foraminifera\nand their relationship to RSL in tropical coastal environ-\nments. The studies include Michie (northern Australia,\n1987), Scott and others (Brazil, 1990), Barbosa and Suguio\n(Brazil, 1999), Hayward and others (New Zealand, 1999b,\n2004b), Debenay and others (west coast of Africa, New Ca-\nledonia and northern Australia, 2000), Haslett (northern\nAustralia, 2001), Debenay and others (French Guiana,\n2002), Javaux and Javaux and Scott (Bermuda 1999, 2003),\nHorton and others (Great Barrier Reef coastline, Australia,\n2003), and Horton and others (Indonesia, 2005). Further-\nmore, most studies concentrate on individual sites and do\nnot investigate the potential for diversity in foraminiferal\nfaunas over local or regional scales. The tropical environ-\nment has many different challenges for foraminiferal assem-\nblages, including the widespread presence of bioturbators\n260 WOODROFFE AND OTHERS\nFIGURE 1.

This paper documents the characteristics of mod-\nern intertidal environments from four different locations in\nthe central GBR province, and compares and contrasts their\nforaminiferal faunas, identifying implications for sea-level\nreconstructions.\nSTUDY AREAS\nThe shoreline of the central GBR is characterized by a\nseries of north-facing coastal embayments (e.g., Halifax\nBay, Cleveland Bay, Bowling Green Bay), which are pro-\ntected from the dominant southeast trade wind by granite\nheadlands or sand spits, but are open to northerly and north-\neasterly weather and the impact of occasional tropical cy-\nclones (Belperio, 1983; Carter and others, 1993). Cleveland\nBay lies immediately offshore from Townsville, Queens-\nland, and Halifax Bay lies north of it, approximately 600\nkm north of the southernmost limit of the GBR (Fig. 1).\nThe bays lie at approximately 198 S 1468\u20131478 309 E. Cleve-\nland Bay is approximately 20 km square and is landlocked\naround its southern and eastern margins by the mainland.\nWithin the bay lies Magnetic Island, which is granitic and\n;12 km in diameter, and rises to an altitude of 495 m. This\nisland shields the northerly part of Cleveland Bay. The\nsouthern part of the bay is shielded by the granite headland\nof Cape Cleveland, which rises to an elevation of 557 m.\nHalifax Bay is more open, but the granite promontory of\nCape Pallarenda also shields the southern half. Cleveland\nand Halifax Bays are relatively shallow, both reaching a\nmaximum water depth of 15 m at their seaward edges (Cart-\ner and others, 1993). Complex water motions occur in\nCleveland Bay, including the effects of refracted SE-gen-\nerated swell waves, and the tidal range for both bays is\ngenerally mesotidal (;2.3 m; Carter and others, 1993; Lar-\ncombe and others, 1995). Australian Height Datum (AHD)\nis the local height datum used in this study. Mean Sea Level\nis 0.1 m above 0 m AHD. Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT)\nis 21.86 m AHD, Mean High Water of Spring Tides\n(MHWST) is 11.21 m AHD, and Highest Astronomical\nTide (HAT) is 12.15 m AHD.\nCOCOA CREEK, CLEVELAND BAY\nCocoa Creek is the southernmost of four tidal creeks en-\ntering Cleveland Bay. The main channel meanders for 9.5\nkm through an extensive chenier plain close to the granite\nescarpment of Cape Cleveland, and extends 600 m seawards\nof the last chenier ridge through an extensive, well-devel-\noped mangrove fringe that is in places up to 400 m wide.\nThe mangroves are mature and florally diverse, with trees\nup to 8 m in height. The mean spring tide range is 2.3 m.\nThe transect at Cocoa Creek was taken perpendicular to the\nshoreline, in a series of sub-transects which cover the range\nfrom 24.5 m AHD (22.72 m LAT) to 1.16 m AHD (0.05\nm below MHWST; Table 1). We collected data from 35\nsample stations. We took samples at 10-cm elevation inter-\nvals where possible (apart from below LAT, where this was\n261MANGROVE FORAMINIFERA OF NE AUSTRALIA\nnot possible). The shallow subtidal and lower intertidal en-\nvironment (24.5 m AHD to 20.05 m AHD) is dominated\nby a silty substrate (;70% silt), with a low organic content\n(,5%), low salinity and neutral pH. The fringing Rhizo-\nphora stylosa-dominated floral zone starts at 0 m AHD,\nmarked by a distinct change in grain size distributions from\n;70% silt to ;90% clay, an increase in organic content to\n;10%, increasing salinity (10\u201315\u2030) and a drop in pH. The\nRhizophora stylosa mangroves are mature and vegetation\ncover is dense. At 0.78 m AHD there is a transition to a\nCeriops sp. floral zone, which is accompanied by an in-\ncrease in organic content to ;19%, a further increase in\nsalinity to ;20\u2030 and a further drop in pH. The transect\nstops at 1.16 m AHD against an unvegetated, sand-rich, 3-\nm-high chenier ridge.\nSANDFLY CREEK, CLEVELAND BAY\nSandfly Creek is the northernmost and smallest of the\nfour tidal estuaries in Cleveland Bay (Fig. 1). The main\nchannel of Sandfly Creek meanders through a series of chen-\nier ridges, and extends 800 m seaward of the final ridge\nthrough fairly mature mangroves and shallow tidal flats. The\nfringing mangroves extend along the coast on either side of\nthe mouth of the creek for some distance, with large stands\nof Rhizophora stylosa and Avicennia marina at the mouth\nof the creek (Bunt and Bunt, 1999). The mean spring tidal\nrange is 2.3 m.\nSandfly Creek Transect 1\nThis transect was taken diagonally from the creek mouth,\nperpendicular to the shoreline, and has 14 sample stations,\nwhich we placed strategically where there are changes in\ntopography or vegetation. The transect covers a range from\njust below MLWST to MHWST (Table 1). The sedimentary\nenvironment consists of a silt-rich unvegetated tidal flat be-\nlow approximately 20.3 m AHD, moving into a sparsely\nvegetated fringing Avicennia marina-dominated floral zone\nat approximately 0 m AHD, with an increasingly sandy sub-\nstrate. Salinity is low in these two zones, whereas pH is\nneutral. At 0.15 m AHD, there is a transition to a densely\nvegetated Rhizophora stylosa-dominated floral zone, with\nbetween 80\u201390% vegetation cover. The substrate remains\npredominantly sandy. Salinity increases while pH decreases\nthrough this zone. At approximately 0.6 m AHD, a transi-\ntion occurs to a second, more dense Avicennia marina-dom-\ninated floral zone. This floral zone is less dense than the\nRhizophora stylosa-dominated zone it replaces. The sub-\nstrate becomes more clay-rich, salinity continues to increase\n(;13\u2030) and pH rises slightly. This zone is interrupted at\n0.9 m AHD by an unvegetated, sand-rich chenier ridge, ap-\nproximately 5 m wide and 2 m high. The mangrove contin-\nues behind this chenier ridge, consisting predominantly of\nAegiceras corniculatum mangrove species, which are infre-\nquently inundated by saline waters from the estuarine chan-\nnel.\nSandfly Creek Transect 2\nThis transect was taken perpendicular to the shoreline\nthrough a series of floral mangrove zones, approximately\n100 m west of the mouth of Sandfly Creek, and has 20\nsample stations, which we placed strategically where there\nwere marked changes in topography or vegetation. The tran-\nsect covers a range from just below MLWST to MHWST\n(Table 1). There is an unvegetated, silty tidal flat at approx-\nimately 20.8 m AHD, grading into a sparsely vegetated\nfringing Avicennia marina-dominated floral zone at 20.6 m\nAHD. A few small, sandy tidal channels occur in this zone.\nSalinity is low in these zones (;8\u2030) and pH is relatively\nhigh. At 20.3 m AHD, there is a transition to a poorly\ndeveloped Rhizophora stylosa-dominated floral zone. The\nRhizophora stylosa mangroves are juvenile and do not have\nwell-developed prop roots. Salinity increases through this\nzone (;13\u2030) and pH drops to near neutral. At 0 m AHD,\nthere is a transition to an open Avicennia marina-dominated\nfloral zone. Salinity increases again through this zone\n(;15\u2030), and pH remains fairly neutral. This zone is inter-\nrupted at 0.25 m AHD by an unvegetated, sand-rich chenier\nridge, which is also present at Transect 1.\nSAUNDERS CREEK, HALIFAX BAY\nApproximately 50 km north of Townsville, in southern\nHalifax Bay, is Saunders Creek, which meanders through\ndense, estuarine mangroves towards the final shoreline,\nformed by a beach ridge. The transect at Saunders Creek\nwas taken perpendicular to the estuarine channel, with a\ntotal of 10 sample stations, which we placed strategically\nwhere there were marked changes in topography or vege-\ntation. The transect covers a range from just above MLWST\nto just below Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT; Table 1).\nThe unvegetated channel is at approximately 20.5 m AHD,\nand has a very high sand percentage (95%), very low salin-\nity (,5\u2030) and relatively low pH. At 20.4 m AHD, there\nis a transition to a densely vegetated Rhizophora stylosa-\ndominated floral zone, with increasing salinity values\n(;10\u2030), a silt-rich substrate (44% silt) and increasing pH\nlevels. Vegetation cover is approximately 95% in this zone.\nAt 1.4 m AHD, there is a transition to a narrow Avicennia\nmarina-dominated floral zone, which has high salinity\n(;18\u2030) and high pH. At 1.55 m AHD, there is a transition\nto an open, Aegiceras corniculatum-dominated floral zone.\nSalinity continues to increase to approximately 20\u2030, where-\nas pH remains high. The substrate is silt-rich, and the den-\nsity of vegetation cover decreases to approximately 60%. At\n1.6 m AHD, there is a transition from an Aegiceras corni-\nculatum-dominated floral zone to a saltpan. Salinity increas-\nes to approximately 28\u2030, and vegetation cover decreases\nto approximately 10% and is made up of small stands of\nSalicornia australis and other salt-tolerant marsh species.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe collected foraminifer samples (10 cm2 surface sample\nby 1 cm thick) and environmental samples (30 cm2 surface\nsample by 1 cm thick) from transects which crossed the\nwhole of the mangrove zonation and intertidal zone where\npossible (following Horton, 1999). All readings were taken\nat low tide during a neap tidal cycle in the southern hemi-\nsphere winter. The environmental samples were analyzed for\ngrain size, loss on ignition, pH and salinity. Salinity and pH\nanalyses were performed by adding 25 ml of distilled water\n262 WOODROFFE AND OTHERS\nto 5 g of sediment and measuring levels in the water. Sur-\nface samples were generally concentrated within subenvi-\nronments near to mean sea level, particularly within the\nmangrove swamp, intertidal mudflat and shallow subtidal\nmudflat. All stations were leveled using a level and staff.\nAn altitude for each station in relation to Australian Height\nDatum was achieved by either leveling the altitude of the\nswash mark from the previous high tide, or leveling to the\nsea and using a \u2019timed still\u2019 water reading to relate the al-\ntitudes to the tidal curve for Townsville (following Horton\nand others, 2003).\nFORAMINIFERAL ANALYSIS\nSample preparation followed that of Scott and others\n(2001). Each sample was placed in buffered ethanol with\nthe protein stain rose Bengal to identify organisms living at\nthe time of collection (after Murray, 1991). Samples were\nsubdivided into eight aliquots using a wet-splitter (Scott and\nothers, 2001), and 200 tests were counted where possible.\nTaxonomy (Pl. 1) follows Albani (1968), Haig (1988), Bron-\nniman and Whittaker (1993), Wynn-Jones (1994), Yassini\nand Jones (1995), Hayward and others (1999a), Revets\n(2000) and Horton and others (2003). Recent advances in\nmolecular and morphometric analysis (Hayward and others,\n2004a) have allowed the distinction of different morpholog-\nical types of Ammonia, commonly described in the literature\nas Ammonia beccarii. In light of this work we have illus-\ntrated most morphological types described in this paper as\nAmmonia aoteana (Pl. 1).\nThe foraminiferal data are expressed as a percentage of\ndead assemblages only (following Horton, 1999). Horton\n(1999) found that the dead assemblage most closely resem-\nbles fossilized assemblages found in cores. However, the\nissue of using live, dead or total assemblages remains a\nmatter of contention (eg., Scott and Medioli, 1980b; Murray,\n2000). The dead assemblage differs from the live assem-\nblage through life processes and postmortem changes (Mur-\nray, 1991). It has been argued by Murray (1991, 2000) and\nothers (Horton and Edwards, 2004 in press; Horton and oth-\ners, 2005) that the live component is variable and is not\ntransferred into subsurface environments; therefore, its in-\nclusion would degrade the utility of the dataset. By using\nthe dead assemblage, we are able to compare our data with\nthat of Horton and others (2003) from the same coastline.\nDead individuals contribute at least 86% of the total number\nof tests counted at each site.\nThe foraminiferal preservation was generally very good,\nalthough samples in Sandfly Creek Transect 1 often yielded\nless than 40 specimens. For samples from the other three\ntransects, a total of at least 200 was reached (following Pat-\nterson and Fishbein, 1989). We used unconstrained incre-\nmental sum-of-squares cluster analysis to detect, describe\nand classify patterns within the foraminiferal data from Co-\ncoa Creek, Sandfly Creek Transect 2 and Saunders Creek.\nWe used unconstrained cluster analysis based on unweighted\nEuclidean distance with foraminifera as unstandardized per-\ncentage abundances to classify contemporary samples into\nmore-or-less homogeneous groups (clusters). Detrended\nCorrespondence Analysis (DCA) was used to represent sam-\nples as points in multidimensional space. Only samples with\ncounts greater than 160 individuals and species that reach\n5% of the total sum were included. Cluster analysis is ef-\nfective in classifying the samples according to their fora-\nminiferal assemblage, but Detrended Correspondence Anal-\nysis gives further information about the pattern of variation\nwithin and between groups, which is important because the\nprecise boundaries between clusters can be arbitrary. The\nelevation of each station within the reliable clusters was\nanalyzed to determine a vertical zonation of each intertidal\nenvironment. Cluster analysis and DCA are illustrated for\nCocoa Creek in Figure 2. Other sites are not shown, but this\ninformation is available from the authors. A repository with\nall foraminiferal data from this study is located at http:\/\/\nwww.CushmanFoundation.org, with reference number JFR\nDR200508.\nRESULTS\nA total of 72 dead foraminiferal species were found in\nsamples taken from the intertidal and shallow subtidal\nzones. The composition of the foraminiferal assemblages\nand their vertical zonation are given below.\nCOCOA CREEK\nThere were abundant foraminifera within this transect,\nwith counts in excess of 200 possible at all sample stations\n(Figs. 2, 3). The dominant species in the subtidal and inter-\ntidal mudflat were Pararotalia venusta, Parrellina hispi-\ndula, Ammonia aoteana and A. tepida. The fauna in the\nmudflat zone was highly diverse, with up to 30 different\nspecies recorded at each sample station. The Rhizophora\nstylosa zone marks a transition from a fully calcareous as-\nsemblage to a mixed calcareous and agglutinated assem-\nblage, dominated by A. aoteana, Rosalina sp., Miliammina\nfusca and Paratrochammina stoeni. The uppermost part of\nthe transect, in the Ceriops sp. zone close to MHWST, has\na fully agglutinated assemblage dominated by M. fusca,\nTrochammina inflata and Haplophragmoides sp. Cluster\nanalysis of foraminiferal death assemblages at each sample\nstation detects three zones (Fig. 2):\n\u25cf Zone CC I is an agglutinated foraminiferal zone with a\nlow species diversity (approximately 12 species per sam-\nple). The dominant species are Miliammina fusca, Tro-\nchammina inflata, Ammotium directum and Haplophrag-\nmoides sp. The elevation range of this zone is 0.32\u20131.16\nm AHD (vertical range of 0.84 m).\n\u25cf Zone CC IIa is a mixed calcareous and agglutinated fo-\nraminiferal zone with a reasonably diverse fauna (ap-\nproximately 18 species found at each sample station). The\ndominant species are A. aoteana, Rosalina sp., Paratro-\nchammina stoeni and M. fusca. The elevation range of\nthis zone is 0.04\u20130.30 m AHD (vertical range of 0.26 m).\n\u25cf Zone CC IIb is a fully calcareous foraminiferal zone with\na highly diverse fauna (approximately 30 species found\nat each sample station). The dominant species are Par-\narotalia venusta, Parrellina hispidula, A. aoteana and\nA. tepida. Pararotalia venusta alone accounts for be-\ntween 20\u201354 % of the count at each sample station. The\nelevation range of this zone is 24.58\u201320.05 m AHD\n(vertical range of 4.53 m).\n263MANGROVE FORAMINIFERA OF NE AUSTRALIA\nSANDFLY CREEK TRANSECT 1\nThe foraminiferal preservation in the surface sediments\nranged between several hundred and 0 tests per 10 cm3 (Fig.\n4). The tidal mudflat had abundant and diverse calcareous\nspecies, and counts in excess of 200 were possible. The\ncalcareous species Miliolinella lakemarquiensis, Ammonia\ntepida and A. aoteana were dominant. In the densely veg-\netated, fringing Rhizophora stylosa floral zone and the more\nsparsely vegetated Avicennia marina floral zone, the fora-\nminiferal counts were extremely low (as few as 8 specimens\nper 10cc sample), consisting of a mixture of calcareous and\nagglutinated species, mostly Trochammina inflata and Cri-\nbroelphidium poeynum. Only one assemblage zone was de-\ntected and classified at this site, being a calcareous zone\ndominated by Ammonia aoteana (T1 II). The elevation\nrange of this zone is 20.36\u20130.36 m, a vertical range of\n0.61 m.\nSANDFLY CREEK TRANSECT TWO\nForaminiferal preservation in this transect was good, and\ncounts in excess of 200 were possible (Fig. 5). The domi-\nnant species in the tidal mudflat were Miliolinella lakemar-\nquiensis, Ammonia tepida and A. aoteana, together ac-\ncounting for between 40 and 50% of the total foraminiferal\ncount. Generally, the assemblage in the mudflat zone was\nhighly diverse, with up to 30 species recorded at each sam-\nple station. The foraminiferal fauna was uniform through\nthe fringing Avicennia marina- and Rhizophora stylosa-\ndominated floral zones, but showed a slight increase in Am-\nmonia tepida at the expense of A. aoteana through the Rhi-\nzophora stylosa zone. The second Avicennia marina-dom-\ninated floral zone had fluctuating values of Ammonia\naoteana and A. tepida, but retained species diversity. The\nuppermost transect station, situated at the base of the chenier\nridge, had a unique fauna consisting primarily of Quin-\nqueloculina suborbicularis and A. aoteana (together total-\ning 77% of the count at this sample station). Cluster analysis\nof foraminiferal death assemblages at each sample station\ndetects two zones:\n\u25cf Zone T2 IIa is dominated by calcareous species, with\nmoderately low species diversity (approximately 15 spe-\ncies found at each sample station). The dominant species\nare Ammonia aoteana and Quinqueloculina suborbicu-\nlaris, with a maximum relative abundance of 45%. The\nelevation range of this zone is 0.1\u20130.3 m AHD (vertical\nrange of 0.2 m).\n\u25cf Zone T2 IIb is a calcareous foraminifera-dominated zone,\nwith a highly diverse fauna (approximately 25 species\nfound at each sample station). Ammonia tepida and Mil-\niolinella lakemarquiensis are the dominant species, with\na maximum relative abundance of 56 %. Other notable\nspecies include A. aoteana, Triloculina oblonga and\nWiesnerella auriculata. The elevation range of this zone\nis 20.9\u20130.2 m AHD (vertical range of 1.1 m).\nSAUNDERS CREEK\nIn the tidal creek, the assemblage is dominated by Am-\nmonia aoteana (up to 80% of the total count), with low but\npersistent occurrences of agglutinated species Miliammina\nfusca and Trochammina inflata (Fig. 6). Through the fring-\ning Rhizophora stylosa floral zone, Ammonia aoteana de-\ncreases and agglutinated species increase rapidly. Miliam-\nmina fusca peaks through this floral zone. The ratio of ag-\nglutinated to calcareous species is 60:40 through the\nRhizophora zone. Moving into the Avicennia marina-dom-\ninated floral zone, Trochammina inflata gains in relative\nimportance, and in the Aegiceras corniculatum floral zone,\nTrochammina inflata is the dominant species (60% of the\ncounts). In the upper intertidal saltpan, both Trochammina\ninflata and Miliammina fusca dominate. Multivariate anal-\nysis of foraminiferal death assemblages from Saunders\nCreek delineates two zones:\n\u25cf Zone SC I has both calcareous and agglutinated species\nand consists of eight samples. Species diversity is fairly\nlow (approximately 15 species per sample). The dominant\nspecies are Miliammina fusca, Trochammina inflata and\nAmmonia aoteana, together accounting for a maximum\nof 84% relative abundance. The elevation range of this\nzone is 20.1\u20131.7 m AHD.\n\u25cf Zone SC IIa is dominated by calcareous species, and con-\nsists of two samples from the lower end of the transect,\nin the tidal creek. Species diversity is low (approximately\n10 species per sample), and the dominant species is Am-\nmonia aoteana, with a maximum relative abundance of\n68%. The elevation range of this zone is 20.5\u20130.1 m\nAHD (vertical range of 0.4 m).\nDISCUSSION\nThe four transects from Cleveland Bay and Halifax Bay\neach show different foraminiferal assemblages across a trop-\nical mangrove environment (Fig. 7). Sandfly Creek Transect\n1 had very high and very low counts, in excess of 200 tests\nper 10 cm3 in the mudflat environment, but in the fringing\nRhizophora stylosa and sparsely vegetated Avicennia ma-\nrina zones, counts were as low as 8 tests per 10 cm3. All\nof the other sites had abundant foraminifera within them.\nThere are many controlling factors on foraminiferal abun-\ndance and type, including nutrition, dissolved oxygen con-\nditions, pH, salinity, substrate and temperature (e.g., Mur-\nray, 1968; Alve and Nagy, 1986; Boltovskoy and others,\n1991; de Rijk, 1995; Barbosa and Suguio, 1999; Debenay\nand others, 2002; Horton and others, 2003). Barbosa and\nSuguio (1999) and Horton and others (2003) show that the\nforaminiferal assemblages in the coastal mangroves of Bra-\nzil and the GBR coastline, respectively, are controlled by\nthe elevation with respect to the tidal frame. However,\nground temperature, sparse vegetation cover and low organ-\nic content are particularly important considerations in trop-\nical locations, where ponded water in the intertidal zone can\nreach temperatures of over 408C between tidal inundations\nand there is less organic food available (Murray, 1968; Dub-\nlin-Green, 1992; de Rijk, 1995).\nSandfly Creek Transect 1 was relatively acidic. The pH\nvariations within intertidal environments are generally great-\ner than in any other marine environment (Phleger and Brad-\nshaw, 1966), and pH has an effect on both the protoplasmic\ncell and the calcareous test of foraminifera. Experiments us-\ning live Ammonia in normal salinity waters of different pH\nshow that decalcification begins at values below 7.5 (Le\n264 WOODROFFE AND OTHERS\nPLATE 1\nFig. 1a Acupeina triperforata (Millett) side view, 3120.

Low pH\nis unfavorable for calcareous foraminifera, and individuals\nmust spend considerable energy recalcifying their tests.\nThe low intertidal mudflat at Sandfly Creek Transect 1\nhad an average pH of 7, whereas the pH in the vegetated\nRhizophora stylosa and Avicennia marina zones ranges\nfrom 6.2\u20136.6, within and below the reported pH range\nwhich may cause dissolution of tests. This may explain the\ntotal absence of calcareous foraminifera in Sandfly Creek\nTransect 1 through the vegetated zones, which are below the\nelevation range where agglutinated foraminifera are found.\nLevels of pH through the vegetated zones at Sandfly Creek\nTransect 2 remain above 7.5, so total dissolution of calcar-\neous tests does not occur. Debenay and others (2002) argue\nthat decomposition of leaf litter in mangrove zones by bac-\nterial activity lowers pH and contributes to the disappear-\nance of calcareous foraminifera. These local-scale variations\nin pH levels impact greatly on foraminiferal presence and\nabundance.\nMultivariate analysis of samples from Sandfly Creek\nTransect 2, Cocoa Creek and Saunders Creek shows a series\nof foraminiferal assemblages which cluster in relation to el-\nevation. However, none of the transects cover the whole\nintertidal zone from LAT to HAT because of morphological\nconstraints such as chenier ridges (Fig. 7).

Similar faunal assem-\nblages have been found in other tropical locations.

Summary of foraminiferal death assemblages at each\nfield location, with tidal levels for Halifax and Cleveland bays.\nwesi, and furthermore, Debenay and others (2000) have\nidentified agglutinated foraminifera (Jadammina macres-\ncens and Trochammina inflata) in upper marshes in New\nCaledonia and Cairns, northeastern Queensland, Australia.\nZones CC IIa, T1 II, T2 IIa and SC IIa at Cocoa, Sandfly\nand Saunders creeks have assemblages with low species di-\nversity and dominated by Ammonia aoteana, accounting for\n20\u201368% of the total count at each sample station in each\nzone. The elevation range is 20.5\u20130.3 m AHD (range 0.8\nm, just below MLWNT to just below MHWNT). Other stud-\nies from tropical and subtropical locations have shown an\nAmmonia-dominated assemblage in the mid-intertidal zone\n(e.g., Haslett, 2001, in the upper part of the tidal flat at the\nBarron River estuary, Cairns, northeastern Queensland,\nAustralia; Hayward and others, 1999, in tidal flats and man-\ngrove forests in New Zealand; and Horton and others, 2005,\nin Indonesia). It is also found in a lower estuarine environ-\nment in Brazil (Barbosa and Suguio, 1999).\nFaunal zones CC IIb and T2 IIb are found at the seaward\nedge of transects at Cocoa and Sandfly Creeks. They have\ndiverse calcareous assemblages dominated by Pararotalia\nvenusta, Ammonia tepida and Parrellina hispidula, and an\nelevation range of 24.58\u20130.20 m AHD (range 4.78 m,\n22.72 m LAT to just above MTL). Haslett (2001) found a\ndiverse foraminiferal assemblage, dominated by A. beccarii\nbut with many other shallow marine benthic and planktonic\nspecies, in the lower intertidal zone of the Barron River\nestuary, and Horton and others (2003) observe a similar\ncalcareous dominated assemblage at Cocoa Creek in the in-\ntertidal mudflats. This study is one of the first in tropical\nAustralia to extend the sampling of intertidal mudflats to\nbelow the limit of LAT, into the shallow subtidal area. It\nshows the extension of this diverse calcareous zone beneath\nthe intertidal zone and implies that for this low intertidal\/\nshallow subtidal assemblage, the duration and frequency of\ntidal inundation may not be the most important limiting fac-\ntor.\nNo clear link between foraminiferal assemblages and flo-\nral zones can be established from our new field sites. The\nAmmonia aoteana-dominated zone is correlated with an up-\nper mangrove, Avicennia marina-dominated floral assem-\nblage at Sandfly Creek, a fringing Rhizophora stylosa zone\nat Cocoa Creek, and with a vegetation-free creek bed at\nSaunders Creek. Sandfly Creek Transect 2 shows a transition\nfrom mudflat to Rhizophora stylosa-dominated floral assem-\nblage at a lower elevation than at the other two sites. This\nmay explain why the Ammonia aoteana zone at Sandfly\nCreek is higher in the mangrove sequence than at the other\ntwo sites, despite being at a similar elevation. Localized\ndifferences in mangrove zonation may be determined on a\nsmall scale by factors such as sediment transport and nutri-\nent availability, as well as by tidal inundation frequency\n(Bunt and Bunt, 1999). Floral zones appear to respond to\nthe local environment, while foraminiferal zonation occurs\nat similar elevations at different types of sites.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR SEA-LEVEL STUDIES\nPast foraminiferal studies in temperate environments\n(e.g., Scott and Medioli, 1978; Jennings and Nelson, 1992;\nHorton, 1999; Gehrels and others, 2001) have indicated that\na vertical zonation of foraminifera occurs in the intertidal\nzone, where the distribution of foraminifera is a direct func-\ntion of elevation, with the duration and frequency of inter-\ntidal exposure as the most important environmental factors.\nScott and others (2001) state that a vertical zonation of\nmarsh foraminiferal assemblages exists on a worldwide\nscale, and suggest that the same 8\u201310 species of marsh fo-\nraminifera are ubiquitous worldwide in the upper part of the\nintertidal zone. Information on vertical zonation trends in\ntropical environments are more limited, and the evidence\nwhich exists points to a range of environmental factors be-\ning important. In New Zealand, salinity and elevation are\nshown as jointly the most important factors governing fo-\nraminiferal distribution (Hayward, 1999a, 1999b; 2004b),\nand Debenay and others (2000) show that in mangroves a\nrange of environmental factors are important, including sa-\nlinity and the presence or absence of vegetation.\nAn important issue when considering the applicability of\nforaminiferal zones in sea-level reconstructions is the pres-\nervation of foraminifera in fossil deposits. Agglutinated fo-\nraminifera within high-marsh environments have been used\nto precisely reconstruct former sea levels in temperate salt\nmarshes (e.g., Gehrels, 2000; Gehrels and others, 2002; Hor-\nton and others, 2005). Many fossil cores have been collected\nfrom tropical mangrove and estuarine environments on the\nGreat Barrier Reef coastline. These deposits have many cal-\ncareous benthic foraminifera preserved within silty clay ho-\nrizons, but no foraminifera are preserved within organic-rich\nhorizons (e.g., Fig. 8). The organic horizons have grain size\ncharacteristics and organic content similar to those of mod-\nern mangrove environments, and preserve abundant man-\ngrove pollen. Taphonomic loss of foraminiferal tests due to\npost-mortem disaggregation is an important obstacle in the\nuse of mangrove (mainly agglutinated) foraminifera in pa-\nleoenvironmental reconstructions in this location. The low\npH environment of mangroves is not favorable for the pres-\nervation of calcareous foraminifera; however, agglutinated\n268 WOODROFFE AND OTHERS\nFIGURE 8. Foraminifera and pollen preserved in a core (KG931 VC1) collected from a shallow subtidal environment in Cleveland Bay, north\nQueensland. No foraminifera are preserved in the organic section of the core between 180\u2013235cm; however, mangrove pollen are well preserved\nthrough this section. Lithology modified from Troels-Smith. Symbols: LLL\u2014silty clay, horizontal dashes\u2014organic material.\nforaminifera are also not readily preserved in mangrove ho-\nrizons. Studies show that thin-shelled tests such as those of\nMiliammina obliqua rapidly disaggregate on burial (Hay-\nward and others, 2004) and even handling of materials in\nthe field and laboratory may affect test preservation (Wang\nand Chappell, 2001). We do not find even the most robust\nagglutinated species (e.g., Trochammina inflata) preserved\nin cores. Because of the absence of upper intertidal agglu-\ntinated foraminifera in fossil deposits from the Great Barrier\nReef coastline, it is important for us to understand contem-\nporary vertical zonation trends within mid- to low-intertidal\ncalcareous faunas which live in muddy environments. These\nmay be used, albeit with potentially decreased precision, to\nallow quantitative sea-level reconstructions using foraminif-\neral assemblages from this area.\nAn assemblage made up solely of calcareous species, but\nwhich exists only between MLWNT and MHWNT (range\nof ;0.7 m) and is dominated by Ammonia aoteana may be\na useful sea-level indicator in this environment because of\nthe problems associated with removal of agglutinated fora-\nminifera from fossil sediments. This assemblage often exists\nbelow the limit of fringing mangroves, and therefore is un-\nlikely to be affected by large pH excursions experienced in\nvegetated zones. However, in some locations where man-\ngroves extend lower into the intertidal zone (e.g., Sandfly\nCreek Transect 1), low pH within the mangrove will likely\ncause the dissolution of calcareous tests such as those of A.\naoteana.\nWhere agglutinated foraminifera are preserved in fossil\ndeposits, a modern agglutinated assemblage which exists be-\ntween MLWNT and HAT (range 1.8 m), consisting primar-\nily of Miliammina fusca, Trochammina inflata, Ammotium\ndirectum and Haplophragmoides sp. may be the most use-\nful sea-level indicator, depending on the degree of preser-\nvation of calcareous foraminifera in the fossil cores. The\nusefulness of different modern foraminiferal assemblages in\nreconstructing sea levels should, therefore, be assessed on a\ncore by core basis.\nIn the tropical mangrove environments studied, local\nscale factors affect foraminiferal distributions. Limitations\nto using foraminifera as precise indicators in sea-level re-\nconstructions include low pH excursions causing dissolution\nof calcareous tests and the potential problem of taphonomic\nloss of agglutinated foraminifera in fossil deposits.\nCONCLUSIONS\nStatistical analysis of the foraminiferal death assemblages\nfrom all sites supports numerous studies from temperate and\ntropical regions that indicate a vertical zonation of forami-\nnifera exists within the intertidal zone. An upper mangrove\nforaminiferal zone dominated by agglutinated species, in-\ncluding Trochammina inflata, Paratrochammina stoeni and\nMiliammina fusca, exists in the higher tidal elevation range\n(20.1\u20131.7 m AHD) at Cocoa Creek and Saunders Creek. A\nmid-intertidal foraminiferal zone dominated by Ammonia\naoteana (20.5\u20130.3 m AHD) exists at all sites. A low inter-\ntidal foraminiferal zone, dominated by A. aoteana, A. tepida\nand numerous other calcareous species (24.58\u20130.2 m\nAHD), exists at Cocoa Creek and Sandfly Creek. The only\n269MANGROVE FORAMINIFERA OF NE AUSTRALIA\nforaminiferal zone present at all locations is an A. aoteana-\ndominated foraminiferal assemblage between 20.5\u201310.3 m\nAHD (just above MLWNT to MHWNT).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Scott Smithers for his assistance in the\nfield, and James Cook University, Townsville, Australia,\nwhich hosted Woodroffe whilst the fieldwork was undertak-\nen.
