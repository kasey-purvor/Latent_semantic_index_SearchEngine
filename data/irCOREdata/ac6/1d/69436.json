INTRODUCTION \nThe resonant frequency is always an essential parameter \nwhen 3dimensional microwave or RF cavities, such as \noscillators, filters and accelerators, are designed. The \naccurate study of resonant frequencies has been an active \narea in computational electromagnetics. Many algorithms \nhave been developed to calculate the Inodes of cavities [1]- \n[3]. Over years finite-difference time-domain method on \northogonal Yee's mesh (standard FDTD) has been used \nsuccessfully to work out the frequencies of resonant \nstructures [4]-[6]. When standard FDTD method employs \nrectangular or cylindrical staircase mesh, the coniplicated \nboundaries of physical domain can not be fitted by the \ndiscrete mesh, especially if the boundary has small radii of \ncurvature. In this case we have to refine the discrete mesh to \nensure the numerical accuracy of FDTD method. \nRecently an FDTD algorithm in non-orthogonal co- \nordinates (non-standard FDTD) has been developed to \ninvestigate the scattering problems and resonant frequencies \nof dielectric-loaded cavities [7]-[ 111. The regions with \ncurved segments can be discretized well by non-orthogonal \nnumerical cells in non-standard FDTD method. Working on \nfewer computing cells, the method has a potentiality of \nsaving memory and CPU time. However, the boundary \nconditions of electromagnetic fields in non-orthogonal \ncoordinate are more complicated than those in orthogonal \ncoordinate. The simple treatment on boundary conditions \nmay cause some extra errors. In this paper we discuss the \nboundary conditions of the non-standard FDTD algorithm. \nManuscript received November 1,  1993 \nDiscrete components of electromagnetic fields are obtained \non the curved electric wall and magnetic wall. According to \nthe discussion, we introduce the boundary-orthogonal mesh \nand equivalent dielectric constant on the interfaces of media. \nComparing our results with Harms' [ l l ] ,  we find that the \nerror is reduced from 8.6% to 3.0% for the cylindrical cavity \nloaded by a dielectric button. The modes in resonators and \nfilters are also calculated on boundary-orthogonal mesh \n(BOW and on general non-orthogonal mesh respectively. \nOn BOM the errors of frequencies at which the electric field \nis stronger near the boundary are reduced by a factor about \n1%. Our results show good agreements with the theoretical \nand numerical results. \n11. FDTD METHOD IN NON-ORTHOGONAL CO-ORDINATES AND \nITS NUMERICAL BOUNDARY COOOOOONDITIONS \nIn this section the non-standard FDTD method is briefly \ndescribed, and then the boundary conditions are investigated \non the electric wall, magnetic wall and interface between \ndielectric regions. The numerical components of electro- \nmagnetic fields are given on the boundaries to satisfy the \nimplement of finite difference method. \nA .  The Brief Description of Non-Standard FDTD Method \nIn the isotropic and lossless media Maxwell's curl \nequations with source-free can be written as \nV x H = 8D\/dt , (1) \nV x E = - d B \/ d t ,  (2) \nwhere D=EE, B=pH. Equation (1) and (2) can be discretized \nby the central difference in a non-orthogonal discrete cell, \nshown in Fig. 1, in accordance with the curvilinear co- \nordinate theory. We define the covariant components of the \nelectric field E as the tangential components at the centre of \nthe cell's edges, and define the contravariant components of \nthe magnetic field H as the normal components at the centre \nof the cell's surfaces (see Fig. 1). Although the discrete cells \nare irregulx and non-orthogonal, we can numerically \ntransform them into the cubic cells with the unit increment \nso that the implement of non-standard FDTD method \nbecomes easy. Then the time domain [O,T] is divided into N \n0018-9464\/94$4.00 0 1994 IEEE \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Permuting indices and \nsubstituting all covariant components into (4) and (9, we \ncan formulate the iterative equations of non-standard FDTD \nmethod, in which the critical time step is as follows [ 101 \nktmmax(c c c ( g J m g , - g j n g h ) )  7 (8) \nFig. 1.

If we denote any function of discrete \nspace and time as \nF(iAu', jAu2,kAu3,nAt) , (3) \nthe component forms of non-standard FDTD method can be \nformulated, such as \nIn standard FDTD algorithm the tangential and normal \ncomponents of electromagnetic fields can easily satis@ the \nboundary conditions of a closed domain, even when the \nmagnetic wall coincides with the discrete cells. However, in \nnon-standard FDTD method the boundary conditions \n-h  - ' (4) become complicated because of the non-orthogonality of .the \ndiscrete mesh. If the surface si on which coordinate u1 is \nconstant, shown in Fig, 2, is an electric wall, the component \nBi is equal to zero on the si for Bi is a normal component, \nand the tangential electric components can be written as \n= Ell:?J,k + ( A t \/ E ) ( ~ ~ ) l + ~ , J , k  \n*(h3,1+t,J+t,k 3j+$,]-i,k h2.1+i,,,k+f + h2.1+f.~.k-f \nI (n- f )  \n( 5 )  \n- (At ' p ) ( d G ) l ,  J+i,k+: Hl.J+f,k+f - H1,J+f,k+f \n'(e3,1,~+l,k+i e3,1,J,k+f e2,1,J+i.k+l +e2,1,J+:,k \nl(n++) - \n(9) \n- - $4 ' e, = 0 ,  ek = O  . \nwhere i, j ,  k are integers, Aul, Au2, Au3 are the increments \nof the curvilinear coordinates and equal to 1, El ,  H1 are the \ncontravariant components of the electromagnetic vectors, \ne, hm (m = 1, 2, 3) are the covariant components of the \nelectromagnetic vectors, dg is Jacobian transformation, the \ncomponent gij of the tensor matrix is given by dot product of \ncovariant base vector ai and a., i.e. g!,=a..a.. The other \ncomponents can be obtained by permutahon of indices. \nIt is found from (4) and ( 5 )  that the covariant components \nmust be transformed into contravariant components to form \nself-consistent iterative procedure.

We use \nthe interpolation to eliminate the components that exist in \nthe iterative formulas and are beyond the domain, and have \nHu'+u'12 - -HU,-u'12 ' Hu'+u'\/2 = - H k  u ' -u ' l2  . (15) \nWhen non-standard FDTD method works, on the general \nmesh, numerical errors that depend on the E' component and \nits coefficient in (10) or the H1 component and its coefficient \nin (14), may be introduced. The use of BOM will make the \nboundary conditions be satisfied completely. \nOn the interfaces between cells the equivalent dielectric \nconstants consist of those which are different each other in \nfour adjacent cells (Fig. 1).

Cylindrical Cavity \nAt first, the resonant frequencies of cylindrical cavity \n(radius=lOcm, length=lOcm) are calculated on the general \nmesh and BOM respectively (Fig. 3). The discrete cells are \n12x12~8. We have the iterative times N e i 4 ,  frequency \ndefinition Af=0.009GHz, time step At=1.37x 1 0 - l 1 s  on the \ngeneral mesh. Using BOM, we have N=213, AeO.01 lGHz, \nAt=2.18xlO-\"s. The results are shown in Table I. The DFT \nspectrum is shown in Fig. 4. Comparing the results we find \nthat the boundary orthogonality of mesh has an effect on the \nnumerical accuracy when there is stronger electric field near \nthe boundary. In this example the error is reduced from 1.9% \nto .5% for TMo11 mode when BOM is used. The numerical \nerrors are less than 1.5% for the lowest five modes. \nTABLE I \nTHE RESONANT FREQUENCIES OF THE CYLINDRICAL CAVlTY \nTheory General Mesh BOM \nMode f(GHz) f(GHz) error(%) f(GHz) error(%) \nTMOlO 1.15 1.14 0.88 1.14 0.88 \nT E l l l  1.72 1.74 1.16 1.70 -1.16 \nTMllO 1.82 1.80 1 . 1 1  1.80 1 .11  \nTMOll 1.87 1.90 1.60 1.88 0.05 \nTE2ll  2.06 2.10 1.90 2.09 1.46 \na .a \nFig. 4.
