INTRODUCTION \nIn the last decade, a number of papers have discussed the \nrole of hydrogen incorporation into DC-magnetron sputtered \nhydrogenated carbon films (a-C H), and its relationship with \nheaddisc interface tribology [1-61 Some of these papers \nemphasized the importance of Raman spectroscopy in the \nstructural characterization of the films, in an attenipt to use \nthis technique as a predictive tool to assess the durability of a \ngiven carbon process [2-6]. In the case of pure a-C (non- \nhydrogenated), the position of the G-band of the Ranzaii \nspectrum has been correlated to the rate of frictioiial increase \nduring constant-speed drag testing of untextured, \nunlubricated films [ 2 ] .  More recently, some authors have \nreported on the photoluminescence of carbon films, prepared \nin a methane-enriched Argon plasma [6], This paper i s  an \nattempt to describe more Eully some of the \nprocess\/structure\/property relationships of a-C.H films \n11. EXPERIMENTAL \nCarbon films were prepared on Al\/NiP disc substrates, \nusing conventional DC-magnetron sputtering. Film \nthickness was 25nm, except for nano-indentation work \nwhich was performed using lOOnni thick films Raman \nspectra were obtained on a Dilor XY, triple monochromator \nManuscript received January 30, 1997. \nB. Marchon, 510-353-4916, fax 510-651-7316 \ne-mail: bmarchon@notes.seagate.com \nThe work at LBNL was perfoniied under a Cooperative Research and \nDevelopment Agreement with Seagate (BG92-177) and was supported by the \nDirector, Office of Energy Research, U.S. Department of Enzrgy, under \nContract No. DE-AC03-76SF00098 \nsystem, using an ionized Argon (514.5nm, 200mW) Laser. \nPhotoluminescence data were obtained by excitation at 488.0 \nnm (50 mW). The disk was spun at 3600 rpm to avoid \nheating and PL saturation effects. Electron energy loss \nspectra were obtained by a Phillips CM30 E M  with a \nparallel Gatan 666 electron spectrometer. Bonding fractions \nwere calculated from the carbon K-edge by the ratio of the \nn*(285 ev) to CJ* (290 eV) peak areas. Diamond and \npolycrystalline graphite were used as standards. It was \nnecessary to fit the x* peak with an asymmetric Gaussian to \nobtain accurate bonding ratios. Hardness measurements were \nperformed on a nano-indenter from Nano-instruments, using \n20nm indentation depth. Contact-Start-Stop (CSS) testing \nwas perfornied on 65mm discs, with standard mechanical \ntexture and lubricant system, using 70%, thin-film heads. \nCrash was defined as a complete, l x  visible wear through of \nthe overcoat in the first 5000 cycles. Abrasivity data were \nobtained using a S ic  abrasive tape loaded at 6 psi, against a \nrotating disc, for two minutes. Resistance to abrasion was \nestimated by counting the number of scratches on the film, in \nthe field of view of a x200 micrograph. \n111.

This PL emission has been reported before for glow- \n0018-9464\/97$10.00 0 1997 IEEE \n3 149 \ndischarge a-C:II films [7], as well as DC magnetron carbon \novercoat [6] .  The PL is due to recombination of electron hole \npairs within sp2 bonded clusters in an sp3 bonded amorphous \nmatrix. The PL intensity tends to increase with increasing H \nconcentration due primarily to the saturation of non- \nradiative recombination sites (e.g., dangling bonds). \nFig. 2 shows a close-up of the 900-1900 cm-' Raman \nregion, showing the PL intensity as a linear scattering \nbackground, and the G (ca. 1560 cm-') and D (ca. 1380 cm-*) \npeaks. A convenient way to estimate the PL intensity is to \nratio the slope of the PL background to the fitted Gaussian \nintensity of the G peak. This slope parameter S has a \ndimension of length, and is best described in micrometer \n(pm) units. \ne,\\ ~. ,   .., \\ ,  \n\"-.-..>. ~..

Spectrum is fitted with two \nGaussian peaks over a linear background. \nIn this hydrogen content range were PL intensity starts to \nrise, both film elastic modulus and hardness decrease (Figure \n4), as recently reported by Taki [9] et al., and White et al. \n[lo]. This behavior is consistent with a loss of tri- \ndimensional network bonding, caused by C-H bond \ntermination, and polymeric -CH2- bond formation. \n150 \nL 2  \n50 \n0 \n12 \n10 \n8 \n6 \n4 \nFigure 4: Young's modulus and hardness vs. film hydrogen content. Dashed \nlines are linear fit. \nContact-Start-Stop (CSS) data, however, suggest that, in \nthis particular hydrogen content range, durability increases. \nAs seen in Figure 5, CSS crash rate decreases monotonically \nat the onset of photoluminescence, to reach zero at a value of \nabout S=2.0pm. This result is in apparent contradiction with \nconventional wisdom that harder films should be more \ndurable. However, given the multitude of other mechanical \n(adhesion, fracture toughness), tribochemical [ 111, and \nphysico-chemical properties [12] that are likely to play a role \nin the performance of a lubricant\/overcoat combination of a \nheaddisc interface, these seemingly surprising data are not \ntotally unexpected. Increasing the amount of hydrogen in the \nfilm further eventually degrades the mechanical properties, \nas the film becomes mostly polymeric (data not shown here). \nThe PL intensity, as estimated by S, is an extremely \nsensitive function of the hydrogen content in the film, \nmeasured by Hydrogen Scattering (HFs)7 as Seen in \nFigure 3. According to these data, PL activity starts with \nabout 34% hydrogen, and rapidly grows to a point where \nhardly any Raman scattering can be observed (over ca. 42% \nhydrogen). \n15 \n12 \nE 9  \n\" 6  m \n3 \n0 \nf-? \nz \n32 34 36 38 40 42 \nHydrogen Concentration ( % ) \n0 1 2 3 4 \nRaman Slope (pn) \nFigure 3: Slope parameter S vs %hydrogen.

CONCLUSION \nWe have shown that DC-magnetron sputtered \nhydrogenated carbon films exhibit strong photoluminescence \nactivity in a very narrow range of hydrogen content, with an \nonset of emission at a concentration of ca. 34%. PL emission \neventually overwhelms Raman scattering for values above \nca. 42%. Similar to a-C:H films prepared by other deposition \ntechniques, we believe that the PL comes from isolated sp2 \nclusters and that its intensity increases with H content due to \nprogressive saturation of carbon dangling bonds. In this \nrange of hydrogen content where network terminator CH and \npolymeric CHz bonds are formed, hardness and elastic \nmodulus decrease. At the same time, CSS durability is \nenhanced and reaches a optimum. Besides hydrogen content, \nsputter temperature also plays a critical role in the carbon \ndurability Raman G peak position and EELS data show that \nfilms prepared at higher temperature have an increased \nsp2\/sp3 bonding ratio, detrimental to the headdisc interface \ntribology \nREFERENCES \n[l] J.K.
