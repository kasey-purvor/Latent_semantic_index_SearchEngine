Bayesian methods combine prior probability distributions of model \nparameters, based on assumptions about their magnitude and uncertainty, with estimates of \nthe likelihood of the simulation results by comparison with observed values. Bayesian \nmethods also quantify the uncertainty in the updated posterior parameters, which can be \nused to perform an analysis of model output uncertainty. In this paper, we apply Bayesian \ntechniques to calibrate the VSD soil acidification model for 182 intensively monitored forest \nsites in Europe. Prior distributions for the model parameters were based on available \nliterature. Since the available literature shows a strong dependence of some VSD parameters \non, for example, soil texture, prior distributions were allowed to depend on soil group (i.e. \ngroup of soils with similar texture or C\/N ratio).  The likelihood was computed by \ncomparing modelled soil solution concentrations with observed concentrations for the \nperiod 1996-2001. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to sample the posterior \nparameter space. Two calibration approaches were applied. In the singe-site calibration, the \nplots are calibrated separately to obtain plot-specific posterior distributions. In the multi-site \napproach priors are assumed constant in space for each soil group, and all plots are \ncalibrated simultaneously yielding one posterior probability distribution for each soil group. \nResults from the single-site calibrations show that the model performs much better after \ncalibration compared to a run with standard input parameters. Posterior distributions for H-\nAl equilibrium constants narrow down, thus decreasing parameter uncertainty. For base \ncation weathering of coarse texture soils the posterior distribution is shifted to larger values, \nindicating an initial underestimation of the weathering rate for these soils. Results for the \n2\nparameters related to nitrogen modelling show that the nitrogen processes model \nformulations in VSD may have to be reconsidered as no evidence is found for a relationship \nbetween nitrogen immobilization and the C\/N ratio of the soil, as assumed in VSD. The \nmulti-site calibration also strongly decreases model error for most model output parameters, \nbut model error is larger than the median model error from the singe-site calibration. \nBecause the large number of plots calibrated at the same time provides very many \nobservations, the Markov chain converges to a very narrow parameter space, leaving little \nroom for posterior parameter uncertainty. For an uncertainty analysis with VSD on the \nEuropean scale, this study provides promising results, but more work is needed to \ninvestigate how the results can be used on a European scale by looking at regional patterns \nin calibrated parameters from the site calibration or by calibrating for regions instead of all of \nEurope.\nKeywords: Parameter Estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Soil Chemical Processes , \nForest Soils\n3\n1. Introduction\nOver the last decade, reductions of sulphur and, to a lesser extent, nitrogen emissions from \nindustry, traffic and agriculture have led to a decrease in the deposition of acidifying \ncompounds in Europe. Under the Convention of Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution \n(LRTAP) within the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), so-\ncalled critical loads for sulphur and nitrogen have been used as an indicator of the sensitivity \nof natural ecosystems to acidification and eutrophication. Critical loads provide the \nmaximum deposition on an ecosystem that, on an infinite time-scale and according to \ncurrent knowledge, will not lead to significant harmful effects (Nilsson and Grennfelt, 1988). \nCritical loads and are mostly computed using simple steady state mass balance models \n(Sverdrup and De Vries, 1994; UBA, 2004). As shown by for example Hettelingh and co-\nworkers (Hettelingh et al., 2001; 2007), exceedances of critical loads for sulphur and nitrogen \nhave been reduced and will even be further reduced in the future if current emission \nreduction agreements come into force. In areas where the critical load was exceeded in the \npast and where the present or future deposition is smaller than the critical load, ecosystems \nare expected to recover from acidification. Critical loads, however, do not provide \ninformation about the (speed of) recovery of an ecosystem. Therefore, dynamic acidification \nmodels such as SMART (De Vries et al., 1989), MAGIC (Cosby et al., 2001; Cosby et al., \n1985) and SAFE (Warfvinge et al., 1993) have been used to evaluate the effects of future \ndeposition scenarios on recovery. Ideally, the dynamic model should extend the critical load \nmodel so that dynamic processes are taken into account while all other process descriptions \nare compatible with those in the critical load model. To this end the Very Simple Dynamic \nmodel (VSD) has been developed (Posch et al., 2003) that extends the widely used Simple \n4\nMass Balance (SMB) critical load model (Sverdrup and De Vries, 1994) with dynamic soil \nprocesses, including cation exchange. \nBecause a critical load model provides the maximum allowable deposition for an ecosystem \non an infinitely long time scale, the model cannot be calibrated or validated directly. \nDynamic models, on the other hand, simulate soil solution concentrations as a function of \natmospheric inputs and soil processes, and can thus be calibrated and\/or validated on plots \nwhere measurements are available. Until recently, calibration of most dynamic acidification \nmodels was performed by fitting the simulation results to (a series of) observations by \u2018trial \nand error\u2019 procedures: the model is re-run with different settings until the observation(s) are \nreproduced well. Sometimes a set of parameters is calibrated using various soil (solution) \nconcentrations simultaneously (De Vries et al., 2003a), whereas in other studies only one \nparameter, such as the initial base saturation, is calibrated (Aherne et al., 1998; Belyazid et al., \n2006). A more advanced model calibration was performed by Kros et al. (2002) who \ncalibrated the SMART2 acidification model to soil observation data scaled up to 5\u00d75 km \nblocks using the Gauss-Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The MAGIC model is normally \ncalibrated sequentially, by first calibrating deposition of S compounds using stream water \nchemistry, then calibrating N concentrations by adjusting uptake functions and finally \ncalibrating base saturation using an optimization procedure (Jenkins et al., 1997). Most of \nthese studies do not take into account the uncertainty in the observations and model input \nparameters: only the run that provides the best estimate of the observations is accepted as \nthe calibrated parameter set. It is clear, however, that observations of soil solution \nconcentrations are uncertain, mainly due to spatial variability within a plot. Furthermore, \nseveral combinations of input parameters may give the same model result. For example, base \n5\ncation concentration in the soil is influenced by base cation weathering, deposition and \nuptake. Adjusting growth rates, base cation contents in stem wood or weathering rates for a \nsimulation could all lead to good fit of the model to the observations of base cation \nconcentrations. Calibration methods that include these uncertainties and interactions are \nthus to be preferred over methods that use a simple fit through a (set of) observation(s) \nyielding one set of calibrated parameters without their uncertainty. In recent years, Bayesian \ncalibration methods have been used for calibration of  ecosystem models e.g. Larssen et al. \n(2006), Van Oijen et al. (2005), Vrugt et al.(2006). Larssen et al. (2006) performed a Bayesian \ncalibration of the hydrogeochemical model MAGIC. Using simulated and observed stream \nwater concentrations from a catchment in southern Norway, they quantify uncertainties and \nexamine the propagation of these uncertainties in forecast simulations for 3 different \ndeposition scenarios.  Van Oijen et al. (2005) present a Bayesian calibration for process \nbased forest models, illustrated by the calibration of the BASFOR forest growth model using \ndata from a site in Sweden. De Vrugt et al. (2006) present the Shuffled Complex Evolution \nMetropolis (SCEM-UA) global optimization algorithm for environmental models. They \nprovide examples of its effectiveness for 3 different case studies, among which an \napplication for a watershed model.\nBayesian methods combine probability distributions of model parameters, based on prior \nassumptions about their magnitude and uncertainty, with estimates of the likelihood of the \nsimulation results in view of the observed, uncertain values for model output variables. They \nuse the combined information to quantify uncertainty in parameters and use the updated \nparameter uncertainty to perform an analysis of model output uncertainty. Bayesian \ncalibration (BC) can be seen as a twofold extension of Maximum Likelihood estimation \n(ML). First, BC uses more information than just output data by including prior information \n6\nabout model parameters. Secondly, BC goes beyond identifying a single parameter vector \nwith maximum probability to also estimate its uncertainty. In other words, BC provides a \ncomplete multi-variate probability distribution.\nIn this study, we applied Bayesian techniques to calibrate the VSD model for 182 intensively \nmonitored forest sites in Europe for which data on atmospheric inputs, soil solution \nchemistry and soil properties are available (De Vries et al. (2003b). Two calibrations of the \nVSD model were carried out: (i) each plot was calibrated individually, called \u2018single-site \ncalibration\u2019 hereafter and (ii) the entire set of plots was calibrated simultaneously, called \n\u2018multi-site calibration\u2019, to investigate effects of the grouping of data on calibrated parameters. \nIn this way we investigate the applicability of the calibration method on a large set of plots \nand analyse whether the available measurements allow a site-specific calibration of input \nparameters such that the model performance after calibration is significantly improved \ncompared to that using parameter settings based on regional information alone. Eventually, \nresults of this study could be helpful for parameterization of the VSD model when applied \non a European scale. \n7\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Location of the plots\nThe data for the calibration of VSD were derived from the set of EU\/UNECE Intensive \nMonitoring plots (De Vries et al., 2003b), using those 182 plots where sufficient data on soil \nsolution, soil solid phase, forest growth and deposition were available. Sixty validation \nlocations were selected by k-means clustering of the 182 locations into 6o clusters, using the \nCartesian x- and y-coordinates of the 188 locations as classification variables (de Gruijter et \nal, 2006). The locations closest to the centroids of the clusters were selected as validation \nlocation. This selection procedure ensures that the validation locations cover the study area \nas good as possible. The remaining 122 plots were used to calibrate VSD.\nFigure 1 shows the location of the calibration and validation plots, that mainly consist of \npine- (43 plots), spruce- (80 plots), beech- (29 plots) and oak forest (21 plots). Most of the \nplots cover about 0.25 ha. Measurements from surveys on soil condition and forest growth \nwere used to obtain variables such as soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil bulk density \nand the average stem growth at the sites. Measured soil solution concentrations below the \nroot zone from the period 1996 to 2001 were used to assess the VSD model performance by \ncomparing these measurements with concentrations simulated by the model. \nFigure 1\n2.2 The VSD model\nAs its name implies, the VSD model (Posch et al., 2003, Posch and Reinds, 2008) is a very \nsimple dynamic model that simulates soil solution chemistry and soil nitrogen pools for \n8\nnatural or semi-natural ecosystems. The VSD model can be seen as the simplest extension of \nthe simple mass balance (SMB) critical load model. The SMB model (De Vries and Posch, \n2003a; Posch and De Vries, 1999) computes the maximum input of S and N to an ecosystem \n(i.e. critical load) that will not lead to harmful effects, using simple mass balance equations. \nVSD also consists of a set of mass balance equations, describing the soil input-output \nrelationships of ions, and a set of equations describing the rate-limited and equilibrium soil \nprocesses. The soil solution chemistry in VSD depends solely on the net element input from \nthe atmosphere (deposition minus net uptake minus net immobilisation) and the \ngeochemical interactions in the soil (CO2 equilibrium, weathering of carbonates and silicates, \nand cation exchange). Soil interactions are described by simple rate-limited reactions (e.g. \nnutrient uptake and weathering), first order processes (denitrification) and by equilibrium \nreactions (e.g. cation exchange). VSD models the exchange of Al, H and Ca+Mg+K with the \nGaines-Thomas or Gapon equations. Solute transport is described by assuming complete \nmixing of the element input within one homogeneous soil compartment with a constant \ndensity and a fixed depth. VSD is a single layer soil model that neglects vertical \nheterogeneity. It predicts the concentration of the soil water leaving this layer (mostly the \nroot zone). Validation of the model should thus be based on measurements from soil \nsolution just below the root zone. The annual water flux percolating from this layer is taken \nequal to the annual precipitation excess. The model strongly resembles the SMART model \n(De Vries et al., 1989) but leaves out some of the processes modelled by SMART such as \naluminium mass balance and the soil solution chemistry in carbonate rich soils. The time-\nstep of simulations is one year.\n9\n2.3 Model input data\nInput to VSD consists of a set of 24 parameters, listed in Table 1. We have chosen to \ncalibrate only model process parameters such as equilibrium constants and denitrification \nand immobilization fractions. These parameters are (highly) uncertain because estimates are \noften based on small data sets and the most import VSD output parameters (pH, [Al], [Bc] \nand base saturation) are sensitive to these process parameters. Furthermore, these \nparameters cannot be measured directly and were therefore selected for calibration. \nParameters for which measurements were available at the plot were not calibrated: the \nmeasurement was assumed to be the best estimate at the plot, even though it can be \nuncertain due to within-plot spatial variability and measurement error. Calibrating such \ninputs may improve model performance but results will be hard to use in any upscaling as \nthe calibration results will probably be very site specific. \nTable 1\n2.3.1 Parameters not subject to calibration\nThe thickness of the root zone was set to 50 cm, except for a few plots where evidence \nexists that the soil is very shallow. Bulk density was obtained from plot data unless it was not \nmeasured, in which case it was computed using a transfer function between bulk density and \nclay- and organic matter content (Reinds et al., 2001). The hydrological characteristics (soil \nwater content and precipitation surplus) were derived from simulations with the hydrological \nmodel WATBAL (Starr, 1999). The validity of the hydrological model was tested using the \nchloride budgets at the plots and turned out to be quite satisfactory for the vast majority of \nplots (De Vries et al., 2003a).\n10\nCation exchange capacity, organic anion concentrations and all deposition fluxes were \nobtained from measurements at the plots (De Vries et al., 2003a). Total deposition was \ncomputed from measured bulk and throughfall data, using an adapted version of the canopy \nbudget model (De Vries et al., 2001; Draaijers and Erisman, 1995; Ulrich and Pankrath, \n1983). Deposition of SOx and total N outside the measurement period were computed by \napplying the trend in deposition modelled by EMEP (2001) for the 50 \u00d7 50 km EMEP grid \ncell that the plot is located in to the measured data; historical trends before 1960 were \nobtained from Sch\u00f6pp et al. (2003). Base cation deposition was assumed constant in time \nand was set to the average measured value from the measurement period as neither historical \nnor future projections of base cation depositions were available. \nC\/N ratio and carbon pool at the beginning of the simulations (in the year 1880) were back-\ncalculated from the measured C\/N ratio and carbon pool and historical N inputs.\n2.3.2 Calibration parameters\nAs the 182 Intensive Monitoring plots cover a wide range of soil and forest types, it is \nunlikely that one prior probability distribution function (pdf) for each parameter would be \nsufficient to arrive at a successful calibration. It is known that e.g. weathering rates and \nexchange constants vary strongly with soil texture (UBA,2004, De Vries and Posch, 2003b). \nSince we want to use the best available information, prior distributions were defined for each \nsoil group. Such a soil group consists of soils with the same soil texture and C\/N ratio in \norganic matter. For each plot, a prior distribution for the uncertain parameter was defined \nappropriate for the local soil type. For example, plots in the soil group consisting of sandy \n11\nsoils receive only values selected from the distributions of lgKAlBc and BCwe that are valid \nfor sandy soils. Even if the priors are identically defined for all soil groups, the calibration \ncan still yield different posterior distributions for soil groups. An overview of the prior \ndistributions is provided in Table 2. It lists for each calibration parameter its VSD code, a \ndescription, the distribution assumed (uniform or (truncated) normal), the mean, the \nstandard deviation (Stddev), the minimum (Min, if any) and maximum value (Max, if any). \nTable 2\nWeathering rates were calibrated for six soil groups (i.e. weathering rate classes) that consist \nof a combination of soil texture and parent material. Initial distributions are obtained from \nDe Vries et al., (1994) and Reinds and Posch (2001). Exchange constants, the H-Al \nequilibrium constant and exponent were defined as a function of the soil texture class. Initial \nvalues for exchange constants are obtained from De Vries and Posch (2003b) and are based \non an analysis of hundreds of measurements from Dutch forest soils. Exchange constants \nare not independent, the covariance of the logarithms of KAlBc and KHBc for each texture \nclass was obtained from data provided by De Vries and Posch (2003b) and inserted in the \ninitial covariance matrix so that the candidate values for these parameters are properly \ncorrelated. The initial distributions of the log of the equilibrium constant KAlox was defined \nusing the standard value of 9 as the average for all texture classes with a standard deviation \nof 2. Uptake of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K and N) was computed as forest growth rate multiplied \nwith nutrient content (Jacobsen et al., 2002). Principally these contents are uncertain as well \nbut the measurements do to distinguish between the weathering and uptake of base cations. \nWe therefore decided to calibrate only base cation weathering. For nitrogen, the various \nsinks (uptake, denitrification, immobilization) cannot be distinguished either. Nevertheless, \n12\nwe decided to calibrate both the denitrification fraction assuming a relatively small \nuncertainty and two parameters in an immobilization function. Denitrification was calibrated \nfor two different drainage classes: well-drained and moderately well-drained. Prior estimates \nof denitrification fraction were obtained from Reinds et al. (2001). Poorly or very poorly \ndrained soils were not included in the set of 182 calibration plots as no hydrological data \nwere available. N immobilization can be substantial in the current environmental situation, \n(De Vries et al., 2001; Gundersen et al., 1998) and was estimated as a function of the average \nN deposition for 1960-1990 according to:\ndepimm NbaN \u22c5+= (1)\nwhere a was set to 1 kg N as an estimate of the long-term immobilization even at very low N \ninput (UBA, 2004), whereas the parameter b was calibrated. Parameter b thus expresses the \nproportion of the N input that is immobilized additional to the long-term constant \nimmobilization. Since some evidence exists that there is a (weak) relationship between C\/N \nratio in organic matter and immobilization rates of N (Gundersen et al., 2006; Gundersen et \nal., 1998), three prior distributions for b were defined: one for soils with low C\/N ratio (< \n25), one for soils with intermediate C\/N ratios and one for soils with high C\/N ratio (> 35). \nFor each class a prior uniform distribution between 0 and 1 was assumed as there is also \nevidence that within C\/N ratios classes, immobilization fractions can strongly vary (De Vries \net al., 2001). This is the reason that for the calibration the original VSD formulation of N \nimmobilization as a function of C\/N ratio was replaced by Equation 1.\nIf no literature data were available, expert judgment was used to define the prior \ndistributions of some parameters. Prior distributions for these parameters were taken such \n13\nthat the range was wide enough to cover all possible values. This limitation is to a large \nextent compensated by the calibration procedure that provides posterior distributions that \nare strongly determined by the likelihood and only partly by the prior distributions.\n2.4 Observations\nTo assess the likelihood of the simulation results, comparisons were made between \nsimulated and measured soil solution concentrations below the root zone. Measured \nconcentrations of H, Ca + Mg + K, and NO3 were used. Free Al was recomputed externally \nfrom the measurements of total Al, by modelling complexation of Al with organic anions, \nusing measured DOC values and dissociation and Al complexation constants provided by \nSantore et al. (1995). Measurements were aggregated to average annual concentrations, \nyielding about 5-6 values per plot (1996-2001). Furthermore, a single measurement of the \nbase saturation of the soil solid phase was used. The uncertainty in the measured soil \nsolution concentrations cannot be obtained from the data directly as the samples collected \nfrom various samplers within the plot were pooled into a mixed sample before analysis. It is \nlikely that the uncertainty in the measured concentrations is mostly determined by spatial \nvariability within the plot. A study at some monitoring plots in the Netherlands showed that \nthis variability varies between  20 and  60% depending on depth and ion (De Vries et al., \n1999). An uncertainty of 30% was used as an uncertainty estimate for all plots in Europe as \nthis was about the uncertainty for the major ions at 40-60 cm depth in the Dutch plots. For \nvery low concentrations that often are observed for Al and NO3 , 30% uncertainty is \nprobably an underestimate. For measurements equal to or lower than the detection limit of \nthe most widely used analysis equipment (Inductive Coupled Plasma spectrometry , ICP) the \nuncertainty was therefore set at two times the detection limit of the ICP.\n14\n2.5 Calibration method\n2.5.1  Bayes\u2019 theorem  \nThe VSD model was calibrated using Bayesian calibration. Our implementation of Bayesian \ncalibration strongly resembles the method applied by Van Oijen et al. (2005). In the Bayesian \napproach the prediction of uncertain parameters is taken to be conditional on data, and their \nconditional probability is given by:\n)()|()|( \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 pDpcDp \u22c5\u22c5=  (2)\nWhere p(\u03b8|D) is the posterior (conditional) probability of the parameter (vector) \u03b8 given the \ndata (observations) D, p(D|\u03b8) is the likelihood-function for \u03b8 and p(\u03b8) is the prior \ndistribution of \u03b8. The value of c (=1\/p(D)) is fixed and usually needs not be computed \nexplicitly (Van Oijen et al., 2005).\nThe prior distributions, p(\u03b8), for a number of VSD input parameters (listed in Table 1) must \nbe defined based on best available knowledge. Next, the posterior distribution of input \nparameters given data on model output, p(\u03b8|D), is computed based on comparison of the \noutcome of VSD with the set of measurements of soil (solution) chemistry at the Intensive \nMonitoring plots, including their uncertainty  Equation (2) shows that the posterior \nprobability for \u03b8  increases with an increased prior probability and an increased likelihood, \ni.e. when the selected set of parameter values have larger a priori probability and when the \nmodel is able to reproduce the measurements. The prior probability is directly computed \nfrom the probability of a candidate point of \u03b8 ; for candidate points from normal \ndistributions close to the mean the probability density  will be large, for points in the \u2018tail\u2019 of \nthe distribution the probability density will be small. The likelihood  p(D|\u03b8),  is computed \nassuming measurement errors are Gaussian and uncorrelated (Van Oijen et al., 2005):\n15\n\u2211\n=\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\u2212\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2212\n\u2212=\nn\ni\ni\ni\nii M\nM\nSO\nDp\n1\n2\nlog)2log(5.05.0)|(log pi\u03b8 .(3)\nWhere S is the simulated and O the observed soil solution concentrations, n is the number of \nobservations and Mi. is the standard deviation of the measurements.\nWhen calibrating VSD we assume the model is correct and thus ignore model error. The \nfinal estimates of uncertainty are thus only estimates of parameter uncertainty. After site \nspecific calibration, the remaining error, here expressed in the normalized root mean square \nerror (NRMSE), could be an indication of model error but also includes measurement error \n{Larssen, 2006 #2111}. \n2.5.2 Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nIn practice, Equation (2)  has to be evaluated numerically, by using e.g. a simulation \napproach. In such cases, Bayesian techniques rely on carrying out of a large number of \nsimulations, often in the form of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. To \ncalculate the posterior p(\u03b8|D), we used a simple MCMC algorithm, known as the Metropolis-\nHastings random walk (Robert and Casella, 1999). In this method, the multi-dimensional \nparameter space (where the number of dimensions, Np, equals the number of uncertain \nmodel parameters) is explored by randomly stepping through this space and running the \nmodel for each visited point. The combination of number of steps and step size should be \nchosen such that the parameter space is adequately sampled during the MCMC. In the first \nstep, a candidate value for each parameter is chosen. The model is run for N plots (with N \n=1 for the single site-calibration or N = a set of plots for the multi site-calibration) and the \nlikelihood is determined. We started the Markov chain by selecting for each parameter the \nmidpoint of the prior distribution. To test the sensitivity of the method to the starting point \n16\nof the Markov chain, we have also calibrated the model using a starting point that consists of \nparameter values randomly chosen within the 95% confidence interval of the prior \ndistribution. For subsequent runs a new candidate point (consisting of Np parameter values) \nis computed by moving randomly away from the current point in the multi-dimensional \nparameter space. If, for the new point, the product of prior probability and likelihood \nexceeds that of the current point, the new point is accepted. On the other hand, if the ratio \nof new and current products of the prior and likelihood is between 0 and 1, the new point \ncan still be accepted, but with a probability that is equal to that ratio. The algorithm is \ninherently stochastic since candidate points that perform (somewhat) worse than previous \npoints can still be accepted. If the candidate point is not accepted, the previous candidate \npoint is duplicated in the chain of accepted points. Eventually, this procedure yields a chain \nof points in the Np-dimensional parameter space. To account for a \u2018burn-in\u2019 of the chain, i.e. \nto remove the effect of the choice of the starting point, the first 10% of the runs are \nremoved from the chain. The remaining chain contains all accepted (or duplicated) \nparameter values. From this chain we derived the posterior distribution of each parameter. \nFurthermore, correlation and covariance matrices were computed from the chain using the \nstandard statistical routine CORVC from the IMSL statistical library (Visual Numerics, \n1997). By running multiple chains with different starting points, we have verified \nconvergence of the calibration.\n2.5.3 Practical implementation\nIn the single-site calibration every plot was calibrated separately so that the posterior \ndistributions are computed on a plot by plot basis.  In the multi-site calibration all plots \nwithin a soil group are calibrated simultaneously, thus obtaining posterior distributions for \n17\nthe entire soil group. In the single site calibration we assume that soil parameters vary in \nspace, i.e. even within a soil group parameters values can be different for different sites. For \neach plot the calibration yields a plot-specific estimate of the posterior distribution of \nparameters. In the multi-site calibration we assume that parameters are constant in space. \nFor each group of plots with uniform soil characteristics, one posterior distribution will be \ncomputed. Calibrating for each plot separately can provide insight in the variation and \npatterns in posterior distributions over Europe. Such patterns can provide means to \nextrapolate the results to an European scale. Calibrating all plots simultaneously yields \nposterior distributions that can be directly used on an European scale but only with the \nassumption that for a given soil group parameters are constant in space. \n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Results for single-site calibrations\nIn the following, the success of the BC application to the VSD model is evaluated by \nchecking whether (a) the goodness-of-fit of VSD has increased after calibration and (b) the \nposterior distribution is narrower than the prior, indicating reduced parameter uncertainty (c) \nrunning the calibrated model on the 60 validation plots. The calibration used a chain length \nof 50000 and the mean step length, i.e. the standard deviation of the proposal distribution, is \nset at 3% of the width of the prior.\n3.1.1 Likelihood\nTo quantify the gain in model performance, a comparison was made between the goodness-\nof-fit using a run at every calibration plot with parameters set to the mean of their prior \ndistributions and the average goodness of fit over all accepted runs in the Markov Chain \n(that form the posterior distribution).. Goodness-of-fit is expressed here as the Normalized \n18\nRoot Mean Square Error (NRMSE), defined as the root of the mean squared difference \nbetween measurements and simulations, divided by the mean of the measurements. Figure 2 \nshows the cumulative frequency distributions of NRMSE for pH, Al, NO3 and base \nsaturation (EBc) based on all 122 calibrated plots before and after calibration. \nFigure 2\nFigure 2 shows, as expected, that for all VSD output parameters the average NRMSE \ncomputed from all excepted runs from the MCMC is much lower that the NRMSE of the \nrun using the mean of the priors. Especially for pH and NO3, the model prediction error \ndecreases strongly: The median error after calibration is less than half the error prior to \ncalibration. For Al and NO3 errors for about 10-20% of the plots are zero as both the \nmeasured as well as the simulated concentrations are zero. Figure 2 also shows that for a \nlimited number of plots (about 10%), model prediction errors in especially NO3 and base \nsaturation remain large despite calibration. For EBc these are probably the plots where the \ncombination of observed EBc and observed pH cannot be reproduced by the VSD model. \nSince there is only one observation on EBc and mostly 5-6 observations for pH, it is likely \nthat the calibration procedure will move towards a good fit on pH rather than on EBc. Large \nresidual NRMSE can be due to model error, but could also be caused by measurement error, \nindeicated by e.g. unlikely combinations of measured pH and base saturation.\nFigure 3\nFigure 3 shows the spatial pattern in the NRMSE before calibration minus the NRMSE after \ncalibration, for pH and NO3. The larger the value, the larger the gain in model performance. \nFigure 3a shows that for most plots a substantial gain in model performance is achieved for \n19\npH, but that in parts of Germany, the UK and the plots in southern Europe the NRMSE \ndoes not strongly decrease. Part of the explanation is given by Figure 3b that shows the gain \nin NRMSE for NO3. This figure shows a strong increase in model performance for most of \nthe plots for which pH did not strongly improve. Obviously, the calibration at these plots \nleads to much better nitrate concentrations but the parameterisation improves the simulation \nof total acidity to a lesser extent. Figure 3b also shows that for many plots in Southern \nScandinavia, Eastern parts of Germany and southern Europe, the calibrated model performs \nmuch better for NO3 with calibrated parameters than with the default mean parameter \nvalues.\n3.1.2 Posterior distributions of model parameters\nThe main result of the Bayesian calibration procedure is the joint posterior distribution for \nthe model parameters. The posterior distribution also contains correlations between \nparameters. However, it is difficult to visualize a multi-dimensional distribution for many \nsites, so in the following we shall focus on the marginal distributions for individual \nparameters. If the measurements are conclusive enough, broad prior distributions will \nnarrow down and thus demonstrate a reduction of parameter uncertainty. Posterior \ndistributions may also lie in the high or low parts of the prior distributions, indicating that \nthe data forced a small probability to parameter vectors that were considered plausible \nbefore. If the a priori assumed relationship between soil characteristics and parameter values \nis confirmed by the data, one may expect that the mean of the posterior probability \ndistribution functions will not differ much from the mean of the prior pdf, the but \nuncertainty could be significantly reduced.\n20\nFigure 4 shows the prior and combined posterior distribution of the base cation weathering \nrates for the low (1), intermediate (3) and high (6) weathering rate classes. For the other \nclasses only a few plots (< 15) were available for so the posterior distribution may be more \nstrongly determined by the prior distribution. It shows, as expected, that weathering rates \nincrease with increasing weathering rate class. It also shows that the prior for weathering rate \nclass 1 was underestimated: after calibration the distribution is at much larger values than the \nprior, with the median weathering rate being about 2.2 times as large as initially assumed. \nPosterior weathering rates for class 6 (rich clay soils) tend to be skewed towards small values, \nwhereas the posterior for weathering rate class 3 (clay soils) indicates that the observations \ndo not significantly change the prior estimate, although the posterior distribution function is \nmore uniform than the prior normal distribution.\nFigure 4\nIn Figure 5, the distribution functions are displayed for the lgKAlox parameter, i.e. the \nlogarithm of the constant defining the equilibrium between H and Al concentrations. It \nclearly shows that the data strongly narrow the prior distributions; uncertainties in the \nposterior parameter distributions are much smaller than the a priori assumed Furthermore, \nthe posterior distributions show that there is little difference between the three texture \nclasses. As expected lgKAlox values decrease somewhat with increasing clay content. \nFigure 5\nFigure 6\n21\nFigure 6 shows the prior and posterior distributions for the exchange constants KAlBc and \nKHBc for sand and clay. It shows that the posterior distributions of KAlBc and KHBc for \nsand hardly differ from their priors, indicating that the data cannot improve the accuracy of \nthe initial estimates of the exchange constants. For clay soils, the posterior distributions \ndiffer somewhat from the prior. For KAlBc there is a shift towards somewhat smaller values, \nfor KHBc there is a shift to somewhat higher values.\nIn Figure 7 the prior and posterior distribution of the fraction of nitrogen after N uptake \nand denitrification that is immobilized (parameter b in equation 1) is shown for the two C\/N \nratio classes, low and medium. For the C\/N class \u2018high\u2019 only a few plots were available. The \ngraphs clearly show that the calibration procedure confirms findings based on other datasets \n(e.g.  Gundersen et al., 2006), namely that the immobilisation fraction varies widely even \nwithin different C\/N ratio classes but that low retention occurs mainly at sites with at low \nC\/N ratios. A majority of the sites retain most of the incoming nitrogen (parameter values \nclose to one). Figure 7 indicates some differences in nitrogen retention between plots with \nlow and medium C\/N ratios: as expected low N retention fractions occur more frequent for \nlow C\/N ratios (indicating nitrogen saturation) than for high C\/N ratios. In the majority of \nplots high C\/N ratios more than 80% of the incoming N is retained.\nFigure 7\n3.1.3 Influence of the starting point of the Markov chain\nIn the standard run, the Markov chain is started at the mean of each prior parameter \ndistribution. Ideally the starting point should have no influence on the posterior \n22\ndistributions. Different posterior distributions may be obtained at different starting points \nonly if e.g. the parameter space is not fully explored . Figure 8 shows the posterior \ndistributions for lgKAlox for sand and clay and for the BCwe for soils with texture class 1 for \ndifferent starting points. The figure shows that the posteriors are very similar, indicating that \nthe Markov chain converged to the same part of the parameter space, independent of its \nstarting point.\nFigure 8\n3.1.4 Validation\nFor validation, the NRMSE for the VSD output parameters was computed for each of the \n60 validation plots. One run was made using parameter values equal to the mean of the \npriors (uncalibrated run) whereas in the second run input parameters were set to the median \nof the posterior parameter distributions obtained from the calibration. For each validation \nplot, the proper posterior distribution was selected based on the soil texture, parent material \nand topsoil C\/N ratio of the plot. The cumulative frequency distributions of the NRMSE \nfor pH, Al, NO3 and base saturation (EBc) before and after calibration show that NRMSE \ndecreases for pH, NO3 and to a lesser extent for EBc if the model is run at the validation \nplots using the results from the calibration (Figure 9). The error in the simulated aluminium \nconcentration is about equal in both runs. For pH, NO3 and EBcc the NRMSE decreases for \nabout 65-75% of the plots when using calibrated parameters, for Al the use of calibrated \nparameters leads to more accurate simulations for only half of the plots. \nComparing figures 9 and 2 shows that the gain in NRMSE for the validation plots is lower \nthan for the calibration plots. This is according to expectations. For the VSD application to \nthe validation plots the median value from the posterior distributions obtained from the \nentire set of calibration plots was used, whereas the calibration plots were calibrated \nindividually thus obtaining the best fit for each plot. Nevertheless, the calibration has shown \nto be successful as an application of the calibrated model to the validation plots yields a \n(much) better fit to the observed soil solution concentrations (except for aluminium) than an \napplication with parameter values at the mean of the prior distribution.\n3.2 Multi-site calibration\n3.2.1 Calibration\n23\nIn the multi-site calibration, for every soil group (i.e. a set of sites with the same soil \ncharacteristics), the vector of model parameters is selected from a single prior multivariate \ndistribution and the overall prior probability is computed. We thus assume that the \nparameter values per soil group are constant. For example, all plots with poor sandy soils are \nassigned the same lgKAlox value selected from the prior for poor sandy soils. Then, \nsimulations are made for all plots and the overall likelihood, being the product of all the \nlikelihoods over all plots is computed. It is thus assumed that observation and model errors \nare independent. Next a new candidate point is selected by taking a step in the multi-\ndimensional parameter space following the same procedure as for the single-site calibration. \nThis procedure thus calibrates all sites simultaneously and uses MCMC to obtain values of \nthe Np model parameters that give a good fit for all plots within a soil group simultaneously. \nIn this case the Markov chain converges to a very narrow posterior distribution due to the \nlarge number of observations the uncertainty about the model parameters becomes very \nsmall (Figure 10). The figure shows the prior and very narrow posterior distributions of \nlgKAlox for sand and clay and BCwe for weathering rate class 3. The vast amount of \nobservations (120 plots and 3-5 years of soil solution measurements) causes this very low \nparameter uncertainty. Because we assume VSD to be correct, and thus ignore model error, \nthe uncertainty shown here is parameter uncertainty only, given VSD as is. \nFigure 10\nComparing the NRMSE from the multi-site calibration with the single-site calibration shows \nthat the NRMSE at the calibration plots from the multi-site calibration exceeds the NRMSE \nfrom the single-site calibration for all parameters. Largest differences occur for pH where \n24\nthe median error over all 122 plots from the multi-site calibration is is about twice that of the \nsingle-site calibration. For NO3, Al and EBc differences are much smaller (20-25% in the \nmedian NRMSE). This shows that assuming constant parameter values for a soil group leads \nto a larger model prediction error than calibrating the parameters for each plot separately. \nAlthough parameter uncertainty after calibration is low, the model uncertainty is large, i.e. \nVSD parameterized with spatially constant parameters has a larger model error than VSD \nwith local parameter settings.\n  \n3.2.2 Validation\nThe multi-site calibration was verified by running VSD for the 60 validation plots with \nparameter values sampled from the posterior distributions obtained from the multi-site \ncalibration and comparing the NRMSE with the NRMSE obtained with parameters set to \nthe mean from their prior distributions (see also section 3.1.4).. Figure 11 shows that for pH \nand NO3 the calibration leads to (much) smaller simulation errors, but for aluminium no \nimprovement is achieved. The same was observed in the validation of the singe site \ncalibration. For EBc the NRMSE decreases for part of the plots but increases for other \nplots, but the the largest errors disappear due to the calibration. Comparing Figure 11 with \nFigure 11 shows that the NRMSE at the validation plots using the multi-site calibration \nexceeds the NRMSE from the singe-site calibration for EBc. For pH, Al the errors are about \nequal. For a number of plots the error in NO3 when using the results from the multi site \ncalibration is substantially lower than the error from the single-site calibration. These are \nmost likely the plots in the validation set were despite a high N input, all N is retained. In the \nmulti site calibration the median fnim is close to one and thus almost all incoming N is \nretained, but in the singe site calibration, also low fnim values are present leading to a lower \n25\nmedian fnim. Using this lower value leads to large errors for some of the validation plots. \nFurthermore, because the NRMSE is defined as the root of the mean squared difference \nbetween measurements and simulations divided by the mean of the measurements, NRMSE \ncan become very high if simulated nitrate concentrations exceed observed concentrations \nand the observed nitrate concentrations are very low.\nTo check that the Markov chain in the multi-site calibration converges to the area with the \ncombination of highest prior probability and highest likelihood, the Markov chain was run \n(a) with another, random, starting point and (b) by crudely assuming that all parameters have \na uniform distribution (with lower and upper bounds set at the 5 and 95 percentile of the \nnormal distribution, respectively). In case (b) we eliminated the effect of the form of the \nprior probability and gave the Markov chain more liberty in exploring parameter space. \nResults from the run with the uniform distribution and the run with a random starting point \nof the Markov chain show also a very low acceptance (about 0.3-0.5%) and the posterior \ndistributions only slightly differ from the ones of the standard run. This is illustrated in \nFigure 12, which shows the cumulative frequency diagrams for the three runs for lgKAlox for \nsand and clay and BCwe for weathering rate class 3. In all cases the posterior distributions are \nvery narrow and very similar. This shows that the Markov chain of the multi site calibration \nconverges to the same posterior pdf, irrespective of the starting point or assumptions about \nthe distribution type of the prior, proving the robustness of the procedure.\nFigure 12\n4 Discussion and conclusions\n26\nThe Bayesian calibration technique using MCMC applied in this study has proven a \nsuccessful method to calibrate the VSD model at a large set of locations. By applying a \nsingle-site calibration and sampling from a set of prior distributions defined as a function of \nsite characteristics such as soil texture, the fit of the model on the soil solution \nmeasurements strongly improved compared to model runs with standard values for the input \nparameters. At the same time the parameter uncertainty was quantified, and the posterior \ndistributions can be used for uncertainty assessments with VSD at the plots. This gives a \nclear advantage over simple calibration techniques used for VSD previously (De Vries et al., \n2003a). An application of the calibrated model (using the median parameter values from the \nposterior distributions obtained from the calibration) to the 60 validation plots showed that a \n(much) better fit to the observed soil solution concentrations is obtained than an application \nwith parameter values at the mean of the prior distribution. Only for the aluminium \nconcentration no improvement in fit was achieved.\nPosterior distributions of base cation weathering rates show that for plots in the sandy \ntexture class, often relatively high weathering rates compared to literature data, such as De \nVries et al.(1994), are required to simulate the observed base cation concentrations. This can \nbe explained by the fact that the prior base cation weathering for class 1 is mainly based on \ndata from pure sandy soils. Texture class 1 though, is a texture class encompassing pure \nsandy soils as well as soils with clay contents up to 8 per cent. It seems that a substantial \nnumber of plots with weathering class 1 have a relatively rich mineralogy and\/or high clay \ncontent, leading to higher weathering rates than initially assumed.\n27\nComparison of posterior distributions with the prior distributions showed that the data are \nconclusive for the lgKAlox parameter, because the posterior distribution is much narrower \nthan the prior. For the exchange constants, the calibration does not lead to narrower \ndistributions, but some shifts do occur. \nThe simulation of the nitrogen cycle in VSD is very simple and may sometimes be too \nsimple to adequately model the nitrogen fluxes observed in the field (Evans et al., 2006). In \nVSD, nitrogen immobilization is modelled as a function of C\/N ratio in the soil. In this \nstudy we have modelled immobilization using a linear function, where immobilization is \nmodelled irrespective of C\/N ratios as a fraction of the remaining nitrogen after uptake and \ndenitrification. By defining three identical prior distributions for different C\/N ratios, we \ncould judge by the posterior whether the data yielded a clear difference between the three \nclasses. The posterior distribution of the immobilized fraction of nitrogen for soils with a \nlow C\/N ratio is similar to that of soils with a higher C\/N ratio although low N retention \nfractions are clearly more frequent at low C\/N ratios than at medium C\/N ratios. Also other \nstudies have shown that the fraction of N immobilized can strongly vary within C\/N classes \n(Gundersen et al., 1998). Consequently, the way in which N removal is currently modelled in \nthe standard VSD model needs to be reconsidered. However, the fact that many processes \ninfluence the N balance (uptake, denitrification, immobilization, leaching), makes it difficult \nto adequately model and calibrate the associated parameters.\nThe multi-site calibration in which all sites were modelled simultaneously aiming at the \nhighest combination of prior probability and likelihood over all plots within a soil group also \nstrongly improved the goodness of fit of the model results compared to a run with standard \n28\nvalues for model parameters for the 60 validation plots. The median NRMSE for pH after \ncalibration was about 2 times as high as the median NRMSE from the validation of the \nsingle-site calibration, but for Al, NO3 and EBc a difference in NRMSE of only 20-25% was \nobserved. Due to the large amount of data and the assumption that VSD is \u2018correct\u2019, the \nmulti-site calibration leads to a very small parameter uncertainty with very narrow posterior \ndistributions. NRMSE increases for the validation plots compared to the single-site \ncalibration because we assume that parameters are constant in space for a given soil group. \nThis assumption limits the flexibility of the model to adapt to the local situation. A \ncompromise could be to perform multi-site calibrations within environmental zones \n(Metzger, 2005) instead of entire Europe. This could reduce model error and still allow the \nuse of the calibration results in European-wide applications of VSD.\nFurther study is required to make a full in-depth analysis of the multi-site calibration to \nconfirm that the narrow posterior distributions are caused by the large amount of data only \nthat makes parameter uncertainty small, and that the result is not strongly influenced by (sets \nof) plots with certain (deviating) characteristics or specific measurements. We have noticed \nin the site by site calibration that a few measurements with small uncertainty can strongly \nlimit the acceptance in the MCMC procedure. Such small uncertainty in data must be \nrealistic to justify small uncertainty in the posterior distributions. Therefore we also feel that \nmore data on the (spatial) variation of the soil solution measurements are needed to improve \nthe uncertainty estimates as the current assumption of a fixed 30% standard deviation was a \ncrude assumption based on a single data set. \n29\nIn the multi-site calibration the parameter uncertainty becomes very low because we do not \ninclude a model error term in the computation of the likelihood. To assess the uncertainty in \nmodel structure, a Bayesian model comparison of VSD could be used in which VSD is \ncompared with e.g. more detailed models . Another way to assess the error due to model \nstructure would be to run VSD at plots with completely independent validation data using \nthe posterior distributions of the calibrated parameters and then compare the model error \nwith the model error at the calibration plots (Heuvelink and Pebesma, 1999; Kros et al., \n2002), but this requires a.o. a correct quantification of the measurement error of the \nobservations. \n30\nTable 1.
