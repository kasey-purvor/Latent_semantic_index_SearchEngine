The LPG period and coating thickness are chosen such that the mode transition region, \ncharacteristic of LPGs coated with nanostructured coatings, corresponds with the phase matching \nturning point, ensuring optimum sensitivity.  The functional material is a calixarene, which is shown to \nexhibit sensitivity to the aromatic compounds toluene and benzene, while being relatively insensitive to \nthe aliphatic hydrocarbon hexane. A nanoscale cavity in the calixarene molecule entraps the VOC \nmolecule, thereby altering the refractive index of the coating and influencing the transmission spectrum \nof the LPG. A sensitivity to toluene of 231 ppmv has been achieved, based on a spectrometer resolution \nof 0.3nm. This is a weak molecular interaction thereby ensuring the sensor gives a reversible response, \nwhen the VOC is removed. The recovery time is of the order of 15 seconds.\nIntroduction\nThe sensing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is of importance in a range of applications, for \nexample, monitoring air quality in both indoor an  outdoor environments, and for monitoring soil and \nwater contamination [1]. VOCs can originate from fuel and petroleum products, from paints and inks, \nand by combustion processes, natural sources and farming [2]. There are a wide range of VOCs but the\nBTEX chemicals, that is benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, are of particular interest. The ability \nto detect this chemical family and be able to distinguish it from the other aliphatic hydrocarbons is an \nimportant requirement for a detection system, since the aromatic hydrocarbons have a far higher \ntoxicity. Although less toxic than benzene, the health effects arising from exposure to toluene are \nnumerous, including respiratory problems and the abnormal development of the foetus in pregnant \nwomen, leading to birth defects [3]. The detection of BTEX compounds using SPR techniques [4] has \nbeen reported with spin coated films of calixarene onto gold coated glass substrates, obtaining\nincreasing levels of sensitivity for xylene, butanol, hexane, toluene and benzene.\nThe use of fibre optic Long Period Gratings (LPGs) coated with films of functional materials as a platform \nfor the development of chemical sensors has been explored in recent years [11] [12] [17]. Changes in \nthe refractive index or thickness of the film in response to the analyte influence the attenuation bands \nthat are characteristic of the transmission spectrum of the LPG. The sensor described in this paper \nutilizes a calixarene to form the nanostructured coating, which is shown to facilitate the sensing of \ntoluene and benzene, while being relatively insensitive to aliphatic hydrocarbons.\nManuscript\nPage 2 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 2\nDual Resonance in Long Period Gratings\nAn LPG consists of a periodic modulation of the refractive index of the core of an optical fibre [29]. The \nmodulation of the core refractive index may be achieved in a number of ways, perhaps most often by\nultraviolet (UV) irradiation [5], irradiation by CO2 lasers [6], and electrical discharges [7]. The period of \nthe LPG, typically in the range 100 \uf06dm to 1mm, is such that light is coupled from the core of the fibre to \na subset of symmetrical cladding modes at discrete wavelengths, creating attenuation bands within the\ntransmission spectrum of the fibre, with the resonant wavelengths governed by the phase matching \nexpression [8].  \n\uf028 \uf029\n  )()( N\nnn xcladcore\nx\n\uf04c\uf02d\uf03d\uf06c\n\uf020\uf020\uf020 \uf020 \uf020 \uf020 \uf020\n\uf028\uf031\uf029\n\uf020\nwhere \u03bb(x) represents the wavelength at which coupling occurs to the LP0x mode, ncore is the effective \nrefractive index of the mode propagating in the core of the fibre, nclad(x) is the effective index of the LP0x\ncladding mode, \uf04c is the period of the LPG and N is an integer representing the order of diffraction. \nThe efficiency of coupling to the asymmetric modes is small, and thus in general no attenuation bands \ncorresponding to this coupling are visible in the transmission spectrum. The core and cladding modes \nexperience differential changes in their effective indices in response to measurands such as strain, \ntemperature and bending. Since the cladding modes\u2019 effective indices will be influenced by the optical \nproperties of the material surrounding the cladding [9] , this facilitates the formation of sensors based \nupon the measurement of the change in refractive index of a coating deposited onto the region of fibre \ncontaining the LPG.\nSuch devices show two modes of operation, differentiated by the refractive index and thickness of the \ncoating. For films of refractive index lower than that of the cladding and of appropriate thickness \n(typically > 1 \u03bcm) the response is the same as that exhibited by LPGs when they are bulk-immersed in a \nmedium of lower refractive index [10]. Here, increasing refractive index results in a blue shift of the \ncentral wavelength of the attenuation bands, which exhibit their highest sensitivity when the coating\u2019s \nrefractive index approaches that of the cladding. This has been reported recently for the detection of \ntoluene vapour and xylene vapour, demonstrating minimum detectable concentrations of 0.22ppm [11] \nand 300ppm respectively [12]. \nFor coatings of refractive index higher than that of the cladding, the LPG transmission spectrum has \nbeen shown to exhibit a strong sensitivity to the optical properties of the coating for thicknesses of \norder 100 nm [13]. The response is characterised by reorganisation of the cladding modes when the \noptical thickness of the coating is such that the lowest order cladding mode is phase matched to a mode \nof the waveguide formed by the coating [14]. The mode reorganisation is accompanied by a rapid \nincrease in the effective refractive index of the cladding modes, and a concomitant change in the \nwavelength of the attenuation bands. The optical thickness range over which the reorganisation occurs \nis termed the mode transition region. These effects have been used to demonstrate sensors, with \ndetection limits in the sub ppm range, for the chemical compound chloroform [17]. Optimisation of the \nPage 3 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 3\nsensitivity of these devices relies on careful choice of the period of the LPG and of the thickness and \nrefractive index of the coating and requires high resolution control over the coating thickness, which can \nbe achieved by depositing the film using the electrostatic self assembly [15], Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) [13]\nand dip coating [16] techniques. \nPhase matching curves generated by the solution of equation 1 are an important design tool for Long \nPeriod Gratings, allowing the calculation of a complete set of discrete wavelength resonances [18]. \nFigure 1 shows the phase matching curves predicted for a fibre of cut off wavelength 670 nm. The \ncladding modes are numbered, corresponding to the order of each mode, and the resonant wavelengths \nare indicated by the intersection of the phase matching curve and a line parallel to the wavelength axis. \nA turning point in the phase matching curves is seen [19], making it possible to couple to the same \ncladding mode at two different wavelengths, producing dual-resonant bands in the transmission \nspectrum [20].\nWhen the grating period is such that the phase matching turning point is accessed, a single resonant\nband is observed in the spectrum. As the difference between the effective indices of the core and \ncladding mode decreases in response to an external perturbation, as might be observed if the \nsurrounding refractive index is increased, the phase matching curves move in the direction indicated by \nthe arrow.  The extinction ratio of this resonant band increases and its full width at half maximum \nbroadens but the central wavelength remains fixed, until dual resonant bands are resolved. Further \nincreases in the effective index of the cladding mode cause the dual resonant bands to move apart in \nwavelength. It has be shown that the region of onset of dual resonance gives the greatest sensitivity in \nterms of wavelength change with change in thickness or refractive index [21].  \nPage 4 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 4\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1.

This effect is illustrated in the grey scale \nplot shown in Figure 2. The resonant band corresponding to the LP015 cladding mode shows the location\nof the transition region, while for the LP016 mode the transition region and the phase matching turning \npoint are coincident in this thickness range. The increase in sensitivity for the LP016 mode is evident.\nPlotting the data in such a way allows the relationship of the dual resonance band with respect to the \nmode transition region to be observed.\nFigure 2. Grey scale plot illustrating the response of the transmission spectrum of an LPG of period \n180\uf06dm to the deposition of a coating of calixresorcarene using the LB technique. The spectra were \nrecorded with the LPG in the air subphase. The attenuation band originating at approximately 900 nm \nshows the development of the dual resonance effect.\nCoatings for Selective Sensing\nCalixarene molecules are structures containing a number of phenol or resorcinol aromatic rings \ninterconnected to form a larger ring. The calixarene used here is derived from four resorcinol aromatic \nrings and is referred to as calix-4-resorcarene [26]. The molecular structure is shown in Figure 3. In three \ndimensions this is a bowl like structure [22] that has a cavity in the centre. The eight hydroxyl groups \ngive the molecule a part hydrophilic nature. The hydrocarbon chains are known as pendants [23] and \ngive the molecule hydrophobicity. These long hydrophobic chains are added to make the molecule \namphiphilic, such that it is part hydrophobic and part hydrophilic, which is a requirement to allow the \nchemical to be deposited onto the optical fibre using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique [22]. \nUsing this technique for deposition, a coating of calixarene consists of a matrix of nanoscale cavites \nformed by the calixarene ring, and other voids generated with the alternate packing of the molecular \nPage 6 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 6\nlayers of the coating [30]. The orientation of the film structure is such that the alkyl chains interdigitate, \nand the molecules align bowl to bowl. [22]\nThe analyte molecule can penetrate into this matrix structure. The analyte molecule becomes \ntemporarily entrapped in the hydrophobic calixarene cavity and the voids. An interaction then occurs \nbetween a host molecule, calixarene, and the analyte [1]. Weak interactions [24] occur involving the \naromatic rings of the analyte and the host molecule. Since they are weak and do not involve covalent \nbonding, the analyte molecule is easily liberated from the cavity, and this results in a sensor whose \nresponse is reversible, an important consideration in chemical sensor development.\nThe size and shape of the analyte molecule determines how deeply it can penetrate the calixarene \nmatrix, and the chemistry of the analyte and host determines the nature of the molecular interaction \nwhen the analyte is contained in the cavity. These considerations lead to responses that have different \nlevels of sensitivity to various analyte molecules.\nThe refractive index of the calixarene coating has been measured to be 1.47 at 632nm using SPR [22],\nmaking it a suitable choice to exploit the LPG sensing principles based on nanostructured coatings. Upon \nadsorption of the analyte, the cavities and voids become filled with the analyte and the optical density \nand refractive index increases.\nFigure 3 shows the Calixarene molecule, calix-4-resorcarene used for coating the optical fibre. The space \nencompassed by the larger ring forms the cavity into which the analyte molecule becomes entrapped.\nLPG Fabrication\nAn LPG of period 180\uf06dm and length 35 mm was fabricated in hydrogen loaded single mode fibre of cut-\noff wavelength 650 nm, SM750, via UV inscription using the point by point technique [25]. The \ncalixarene was deposited using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The calixarene was dissolved in \nchloroform at 0.2g\/l, and spread onto a pure water subphase of one compartment of a Nima Technology \nModel 2410A Langmuir-Blodgett trough modified for use with fibre optic substrates [13]. The material \nwas compressed to a surface pressure of 30mN\/m. The dipping speed for the fibre substrate was set to \nPage 7 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 7\n10mm\/min. As the coating is deposited, the layers interdigitate giving an individual layer thickness of \n1.17nm [22]. The transmission spectrum of the fibre was monitored by coupling the output from a \ntungsten-halogen lamp into the fibre and connecting the distal end of the fibre to an Ocean Optics CCD \nspectrometer of resolution 0.3 nm. The spectrum was recorded when the LPG was above and below the \nwater subphase. This is important, as it has been noted previously that the thickness of the coating \nrequired to access the mode transition region is dependent on the surrounding refractive index [8]. Thus \nfor gas sensing the spectrum recorded with the LPG above the subphase was used when deciding on the \noptimum coating thickness.\nTo establish the optimum coating thickness, a thick film in excess of 1\uf06dm was deposited. This allows the \ngrey scale plot shown in Figure 2 to be generated which highlights the response of the transmission \nspectrum to the deposition of the coating. The LPG was then cleaned and coated with 163 layers of \ncalixarene, deposited as a Y-type LB film, corresponding to a calculated coating thickness of 190.7nm.\nThe number of layers was chosen to ensure that a dual-resonant attenuation band develops in the \ntransmission spectrum of the fibre upon exposure to the analyte, indicating that the LPG is operating at \nthe phase matching turning point. \nExperiment\nThe coated LPG was placed inside a closed vessel and fixed quantities of the analyte were injected into \nthe chamber. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the analyte solution vapourized inside \nthe chamber and the response of the sensor to the vapour concentration was monitored.\nThe toluene solution took around 30 minutes to evaporate, depending upon the quantity of solution \ninjected. Benzene on the other hand took around 10 minutes to evaporate. Once a steady state had\nbeen reached, the spectrum was recorded using the CCD spectrometer. Upon opening of the closed \nvessel, the vapour concentration was quickly released into a fume cupboard.\nThe sensor was also tested with hexane, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, and cyclohexane, a hydrocarbon with \na fully hydrogenated ring. This allowed for comparison the sensitivity of the device to four VOCs and \ndetermination of the selectivity of the sensor.\nResults and Discussion\nThe response of the transmission spectrum to exposure to different concentrations of toluene is shown \nin Figure 4. The initial response in air (0 ppm by volume) shows two resonant bands at 850nm and \n930nm which are resolvable. The dual resonant bands become further resolved with increasing vapour \nconcentrations up to 61.2kppmv (thousand ppm by volume).\nPage 8 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 8\nFigure 4 Response of a Long Period Grating of period 180\uf06dm fabricated in SM750 fibre coated with a \ncalixarene to toluene vapour. The sensor was characterised at concentrations of up to 61200 ppmv. For \nclarity, 3 spectra, corresponding to concentrations of 0 pmmv, 30.6 kppmv and 61.2 kppmv are \nhighlighted to indicate the trend for increasing separation of the resonant bands with increasing \nconcentration. The dashed lines are intermediate steps of 7.65 kppmv, 15.3 kppmv, 22.95 kppmv and \n45.9 kppmv.\nThe response can be analysed by measuring the wavelength shifts of the two resonant bands, or by \nconsidering the change in amplitude at a fixed wavelength. The two resonant bands move apart in \nwavelength as depicted in Figure 5. A change in wavelength of 0.7nm per kppmv for the shorter \nwavelength band and 0.6nm per kppmv for the longer wavelength band result in a differential \nwavelength change of 1.3nm per kppmv. Utilizing this differential shift gives a sensitivity of 231 ppmv \nbased on a spectrometer resolution of 0.3nm.\nPage 9 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 9\nFigure 5. Wavelength shift of the longer and shorter wavelength resonant bands to increasing toluene\nvapour concentration. The solid lines are a guide to the eye.\nThe change in transmission of the LPG measured at a wavelength of 900nm as a function of the \nconcentration of toluene, benzene, hexane and cyclohexane has also been measured. This is shown in \nFigure 6 and allows for a determination in the selectivity of the sensor. The results show that at levels up \nto 10 kppmv vapour concentration, the sensitivity to hexane is only 7.5% compared to toluene. For \ncyclohexane the sensitivity is 14.8% compared to toluene. This indicates that the sensor has a high \nselectivity for toluene.\nUpon repeating these measurements, the responses to toluene, benzene and cyclohexane were similar \nwith the exception of hexane. Hexane has shown a response of the same magnitude but with opposite \npolarity. This has been reported to be due to the low refractive index of liquid hexane (nhexane=1.37), \ncompared to liquid toluene (ntoluene=1.49) [30]. However, the lesser response to benzene, which has a \nhigher refractive index (nbenzene=1.50) than toluene indicates that the sensing mechanism is based upon \nchanges in the properties of the functional coating, rather than a response to the refractive index of the \nanalyte \nDue to the response of the spectrum to exposure to the analyte at the particular wavelength of 900nm, \nthe amplitude monitored response for toluene tends towards saturation above 10 kppmv. This is a \nresult of the increasing separation of the two attenuation bands that has decreasing influence on the \ntransmission at 900nm the further the bands separate. However, the two resonant bands continue to \ndiverge at the higher vapour concentrations as indicated in the wavelength response in Figure 5. \nPage 10 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 10\nFigure 6 Volumetric sensitivity of the sensor to the vapours toluene, benzene, hexane and cyclohexane. \nThe transmission is monitored at 900nm and an increase in transmission occurs which corresponds to the \nseparation of the dual resonant attenuation bands. The lines are a guide to the eye.\nThe relative sensitivities of the four organic compounds is evident from Figure 6. The size and shape of \nthe analyte molecule can determine how deeply the analyte can move through the calixarene matrix, \nand the chemistry of the host and guest determines how it becomes confined in the cavity. The \ncalixarene cavity has an upper rim diameter of 1.32nm [27].\nHexane has a single chain molecular structure with dimensions 1.03nm x 0.49nm x 0.4nm [28] and it is \nsuggested that its large size cannot enter the calixarene cavity easily. It is conjectured that the small \nresponse may be due to the analyte molecule filling voids between adjacent calixarene molecules.\nCyclohexane is a ring but being fully hydrogenated is more bulky than the aromatic ring. The \ncyclohexane molecule has dimensions of 0.72nm x 0.64nm x 0.49nm [28]. The results indicate that there \ncan be little molecular attraction between cyclohexane and the cavity.\nBenzene is the smallest molecule investigated with dimensions 0.74nm x 0.67nm x 0.37nm [28] and the \nprogressive response shown in Figure 6 indicates that it can penetrate deeper into the calixarene film \nwith increasing vapour concentrations. Although there is some correlation of interaction with the \nsolvent volatility, there is also some specific interaction with aromatic molecules since benzene interacts \nmore strongly than cyclohexane even though they have the same boiling point.\nThe largest magnitude response is observed on exposure to toluene, which, with its methyl group,\nshows that this can cause a greater molecular attraction between host and guest, which is not evident \nfor benzene. The results show that toluene is optimal above the other VOCs measured here for \nbecoming confined in the cavity of the calixarene matrix.\nPage 11 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 11\nFigure 7 shows the evaporation time and the temporal response of the sensor to benzene vapour, \nmonitored at 900nm. \nThe rise time and fall times of the sensor are shown in Figure 7, with the transmission monitored at \n900nm. The rise time is dictated by the time required for the volatile solvent to vapourise. However, the \nfall time of the order of 15 seconds shows the speed of response of the sensor when the analyte vapour \nis released.\nCentred at around 900nm, a broad spectral feature appears at the phase matching turning point which \nhas a FWHM bandwidth in excess of 50nm. This is shown in Figure 4 between the wavelengths of 825 \nand 950nm. The change of transmission of the fibre at the central wavelength of this broad spectral \nfeature could conveniently be used to develop a low cost sensor, requiring the use of only an LED of \nbandwidth 50nm and a photodiode to measure optical power, and with an appropriate reference \nchannel to compensate for the effects of source intensity fluctuations and changes in downlead losses.\nConclusion\nIt has been demonstrated that using a fibre optic Long Period Grating in conjunction with a functional\nnanostructured coating, chemical vapour sensing can be performed. Dual-resonance in the spectral \nresponse of the LPG has been exploited to obtain improved sensitivity. The phase matching curves allow \nthe grating to be designed to allow the sensor to operate within a desired wavelength range. Further \ntailoring of the grating period would allow the utilization of the mode transition region to attain higher \nsensitivities.\nUsing a calixarene coating, toluene and benzene vapour sensing can be performed.  Nanoscale cavities \nin the coating are suited to a corresponding size and shape of a particular analyte molecule. In this way, \nPage 12 of 14\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nS.M.Topliss et al. \/Sensors and Actuators B XXX (2009) xxx-xxx 12\nthe response of the sensor is species selective. This has been demonstrated with the relative sensitivity \nto toluene 13 times greater than that of hexane for the same vapour concentration. Similarly, the \nsensitivity to toluene is over 6 times greater than cyclohexane. \nA broadband spectral feature resulting from the moving apart of two attenuation bands occurs in dual-\nresonant Long Period Gratings.  This is not due to a change in extinction ratio of the bands, but a natural\nresult of the two bands moving apart.  This feature has the potential to be utilized in conjunction with \nsimple detection optoelectronics to implement a low cost sensor system.\nReferences\n1.     Hassan, A. K., Ray, A. K., Nabok, A.
