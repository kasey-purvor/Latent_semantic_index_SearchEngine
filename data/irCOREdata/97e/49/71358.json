Introduction\nOne of the basic questions in second language\nacquisition (SLA) research is what accounts for students\u2019\ndifferential success in language learning. The individual\nfactors that influence language learning have been\nwidely researched in the past 30 years (for a recent\noverview see Do\u00a8rnyei, 2005). The variables along which\nlanguage learners differ are generally sub-divided into\naffective, cognitive and personality-related individual\ndifferences (Gardner, 1985). With some overlaps,\nmotivation, language learning anxiety and self-confidence\nare generally listed among affective factors, whereas\npersonality-related differences comprise traits such as\nopenness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,\nagreeableness and emotional stability (Costa and McCrae,\n1992). The cognitive factors that are held to be important\npredictors of success in language learning are intelligence\n(Skehan, 1986), foreign language aptitude (Carroll and\nSapon, 1959; Carroll, 1981) and working memory\ncapacity (for an overview see Sawyer and Ranta, 2001).\nThe role of intelligence and foreign language aptitude\nin second language acquisition has been extensively\nresearched, and in the past ten years a number of studies\nhave been conducted on how verbal working memory\ncapacity influences language learning. Most studies on the\nrole of verbal working memory capacity in L2 learning\nconcentrated on various aspects of vocabulary learning,\nand they usually involved a relatively small number\n* Judit Kormos has been supported in writing this article by the Bolyai\nScholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\nAddress for correspondence:\nJudit Kormos, Department of Linguistics and English Language,\nLancaster University, LA1 4YT, U.K.\nj.kormos@lancaster.ac.uk\nof participants (e.g. Papagno and Vallar, 1995; Service\nand Kohonen, 1995; Speciale, Ellis and Bywater, 2004;\nMasoura and Gathercole, 2005). The group of participants\nwere either highly motivated university students with\ngood cognitive capacities (e.g. Papagno and Vallar, 1995;\nSpeciale et al., 2004) or children (e.g. Service and\nKohonen, 1995). Very few research projects investigated\nthe general effect of verbal working memory capacity\non the acquisition of various L2 skills such as listening,\nreading, writing and speaking (but see Harrington and\nSawyer, 1992; Fortkamp, 1999; O\u2019Brien, Segalowitz,\nCollentine and Freed, 2006).\nOur research aimed to fill the gap of studies on\nthe relationship of verbal working memory capacity\nand the acquisition of the four major L2 skills and\nthereby contribute to our understanding of how different\ncomponents of working memory serve as cognitive\ndeterminants of language learning success at various\nstages of the acquisition process. We also intended to\ninvestigate an under-represented age-group in this field,\nnamely young adolescent learners, who constitute a\nmajor proportion of the language learning population\nin foreign language environments. Since in Hungary, a\nlarge number of secondary school students aged between\n14 and 15 years have been recently participating in\nintensive language training programs, we were interested\nin to what extent the level of proficiency in the various\nL2 skills attained by the end of a one-year intensive\nlanguage training program correlates with performance\nin tests of phonological short-term and general working\nmemory capacity. In this paper we describe a study that\nwe conducted in two consecutive years. We analyzed\nthe different role that phonological short-term memory\ncapacity, measured with the help of a non-word test, plays\nin achievement in a complex language proficiency test\nin the case of students who started intensive language\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n262 J. Kormos and A. Sa\u00b4fa\u00b4r\nlearning from a beginner level and those whose level\nof English competence was pre-intermediate at the\nbeginning of the school-year. We also included a new\nmeasure of working memory capacity: the backward digit\nspan test (Morra, 1994), which does not only require the\ntemporary storage but also the manipulation of stored\ninformation.\nIn this paper, we first describe the working memory\nmodel and discuss previous research investigating the\nrole of working memory in language learning. After\nthe description of the methods used in our research, we\npresent the results obtained, and discuss how they support\na relationship between phonological short-term memory,\nworking memory and foreign language learning.\n2. Review of literature\nFor almost half a century, foreign language aptitude was\nconsidered to be one of the most important cognitive pre-\ndeterminants of success in second language acquisition\n(Ehrman and Oxford, 1995). The traditional construct\nof language aptitude, however, has been seriously\nchallenged recently. Important problems with Carroll\u2019s\n(1981) conceptualization of aptitude for language learning\ninclude that it is unclear how parts of the test he developed\nrelate to the components of language aptitude, how\nforeign language aptitude and intelligence interact, and\nwhat relevance foreign language aptitude has in different\ntypes of acquisition contexts (Sawyer and Ranta, 2001;\nRobinson, 2005). The relationship of verbal working\nmemory capacity and foreign language aptitude is also\nunclear. Miyake and Friedman (1998, p. 361) proposed\nthat verbal working memory should be equated with\nforeign language aptitude since it can \u201ccapture the essence\nof the three important components of the language\naptitude suggested by Skehan (1989) \u2013 a language\nanalytic capacity, memory ability and phonetic coding\nability\u201d. Sawyer and Ranta (2001) also argue that working\nmemory subsumes the main components of language\naptitude. Robinson (2002), however, points out that\nlanguage aptitude is a dynamic construct that includes\nother cognitive abilities in addition to working memory\ncapacity.\nThe most widely accepted conceptualization of short-\nterm memory today is the working memory model\ndeveloped by Baddeley and Hitch (1974; Baddeley, 1986).\nWhile previous theories of memory systems focused on\nthe storage function of memory, the new model, as its\nname suggests, adapts a more dynamic approach. This\nconceptualization of working memory combines storage\nwith the processing and manipulation of information, thus\nin this view working memory plays a far greater role in\ncognitive activities such as comprehension, reasoning and\nlearning than previously assumed (Baddeley, 2003).\nThe working memory model comprises a multi-\ncomponent memory system consisting of the central\nexecutive, which coordinates two modality-specific\nsubsystems, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial\nsketchpad. Later, a fourth component was added to the\nmodel: the episodic buffer, which uses multi-dimensional\ncoding, integrates information to form episodes, and is\nin communication with long-term memory (Baddeley,\n2000). The visuo-spatial sketchpad works with visual\nand spatial information, while the phonological loop is\nspecialized for the manipulation and retention of speech.\nThe central executive, \u201cthe most important but least\nunderstood component of working memory\u201d (Baddeley,\n2003, p. 835), has several functions, including attentional\ncontrol, directing the flow of information through the\nsystem and planning (Gathercole, 1999).\nThe most widely researched component of working\nmemory is the phonological loop. This subsystem consists\nof a phonological store, which holds information for a\nfew seconds, and an articulatory rehearsal process, which\nrefreshes decaying information amongst other functions.\nThe rehearsal process is analogous to subvocal speech\nand takes place in real-time, resulting in a limited span\nof immediate memory (after a certain number of items,\nthe first one will fade before it can be rehearsed).\nPhonological loop capacity is often measured by tasks\ninvolving immediate serial recall of numbers (digit span)\nor words (Baddeley, 2003). One of the most widely\nused tests of phonological short-term memory capacity\nis the non-word repetition test, where participants have\nto repeat non-words of varying length. Non-words are\nwords that do not exist in the given language but conform\nto its phonotactic rules. Participants\u2019 short-term memory\ncapacity may then be expressed in terms of the non-\nword span, which is the highest number of syllables the\nparticipant could repeat in at least 50% of the cases. Other\ntests of phonological short-term memory include alphabet\nspan (Craik, 1986) and forward digit span (Botwinick and\nStorandt, 1974).\nReading and listening span (Daneman and Carpenter,\n1980) as well as the backward digit span task are\nconsidered complex verbal memory tasks. The backward\ndigit span task is also part of the Wechsler IV intelligence\ntest for children (Gathercole and Alloway, 2008) and\nis hypothesized to be strongly related to general fluid\nintelligence (see Engle, Kane and Tuholsky, 1999). The\nbackward digit span and the reading and listening span\ntasks are frequently regarded as instruments testing more\nthan just the phonological short-term memory: they\nare claimed to assess the capacity of complex verbal\nworking memory including the functioning of the central-\nexecutive, which is responsible for regulating attention\n(Gathercole, 1999; Hale, Hoeppner and Fiorello, 2002).\nWe have to note, however, that there is also evidence,\nmainly from studies using factor analysis, that tests\nmeasuring phonological short-term memory capacity and\ninstruments assessing complex verbal working memory\ncapacity are in fact diagnostic tools that tap the same\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nWorking memory in intensive language learning 263\nunderlying construct (for the most recent study on this\nissue see Colom, Shih, Flores-Mendoza and Quiroga,\n2006). Complex working memory has been found to\ninfluence mathematical abilities (Logie, Gilhooly and\nWynn, 1994 cited by Gathercole, 1999) as well as\nintellectual abilities such as following directions, note-\ntaking, writing and reasoning (Engle et al., 1999). In a\nrecent paper Gathercole and Alloway (2008) argue that\nworking memory \u201cacts a bottleneck for learning\u201d (p.23).\nThey point out that\nthe acquisition of knowledge and skills in complex domains such\nas literacy and mathematics requires the gradual accumulation\nof knowledge over multiple learning episodes, many of which\nwill take place in the structured learning environment of the\nclassroom. Learning is thus an incremental process that builds\nupon the knowledge of structures and understanding that have\nalready been acquired: any factor that disturbs this acquisition\nwill have deleterious consequences for the rate of learning. (p.13)\nLanguage learning is in this respect very similar to\nthe acquisition of literacy and arithmetic skills and also\nrequires that children maintain information in working\nmemory while engaging in various cognitive activities.\nA great number of studies investigated the relationship\nbetween phonological short-term memory capacity\nand first language acquisition. Young children show\nconsiderable variation in both phonological loop capacity\nand vocabulary knowledge, and these two variables are\nclosely related. The relationship is particularly strong\nbetween non-word repetition and native vocabulary\nknowledge, with correlation coefficients ranging between\n0.4 and 0.6 and is independent of nonverbal intelligence\n(for a recent review see Gathercole, 2006). Baddeley\n(1986) argued that the phonological loop plays a crucial\nrole in the learning of new words by storing unfamiliar\nsound patterns while long-term representations are built,\nwhich supposes a direct link between short-term memory\nand long-term learning. This link between short-term\nmemory and long-term knowledge, however, is not\nunidirectional. Research evidence shows that words are\neasier to recall than non-words (Hulme, Maughan, and\nBrown, 1991), and non-words that conform to the\nphonotactic rules of the participants\u2019 first language are\neasier to recall than non-words which are less \u201cwordlike\u201d\n(Gathercole, 1995), which indicates that long-term\nknowledge also influences processing in phonological\nshort-term memory (Gathercole, Hitch, Service and\nMartin, 1997).\nThe link between phonological short-term memory\nand new word learning was extended to the learning of\nforeign languages by Service and her colleagues (Service,\n1992; Service and Kohonen, 1995), who found that the\nability to repeat English-sounding pseudowords was a\ngood predictor of English language learning success (as\nexpressed by children\u2019s grades in English) among Finnish\nprimary school pupils during the first three years of\ntraining. Cheung\u2019s study (1996) conducted with 12-year-\nold Chinese high school students indicated that non-word\nspan was the best predictor of second language vocabulary\nlearning among those participants whose vocabulary level\nwas below the group average, while in the case of the\nsubgroup with a wide range of vocabulary no such\nrelationship was detected between the two variables.\nAccording to Cheung, this suggests that there is an\ninteraction between phonological short-term memory and\nlong-term phonological knowledge about the L2, which\nexplains that in the case of high-vocabulary participants\ntheir long-term knowledge supported the learning of new\nwords. Papagno and Vallar (1995) showed that short-term\nmemory and word-learning abilities are related among\nadults as well. In a study with university students, Speciale\net al. (2004) found that both phonological sequence\nlearning and phonological short-term memory capacity\ncontribute to vocabulary learning. In the beginning of\nlearning a language, these two variables were separable\nand contributed to vocabulary learning independently. As\nstudents progressed in language learning, they began to\nrecognize the phonological regularities of the language,\nand vocabulary knowledge contributed to increasing the\nefficiency of short-term phonological storage as well\nas the learning of further sequences. These results\nindicate that the ability to learn phonological sequences\nalso contributes to vocabulary learning, and that the\ncombination of the two variables has more explanatory\npower than that of phonological short-term memory\ncapacity alone.\nSome researchers claim that phonological short-\nterm memory plays a more general role in second\nlanguage acquisition than just supporting vocabulary\nacquisition. Ellis (1996) argues that language learning is\nmostly sequence learning, and even abstract grammatical\nknowledge is a product of the analysis of sequences.\nAs short-term memory is responsible for remembering\nsequential information, its role in language learning\nis far greater than previously supposed. Ellis suggests\nthat the acquisition of syntax is also related to short-\nterm memory capacity. Ellis and Sinclair (1996) present\nexperimental evidence that rehearsing foreign language\nmaterial has beneficial effects on both comprehending\nand learning foreign language material, metalinguistic\nknowledge of grammar, accuracy in pronunciation and\nproductive grammatical fluency and accuracy. O\u2019Brien\net al. (2006) showed that there is a link between\nphonological memory and oral production skills and\nthat the nature of relationship between measures of\nphonological short-term memory and various assessments\nof oral performance is different between proficient and\nless-proficient L2 speakers.\nStudies assessing the role of complex verbal memory\ncapacity in second language acquisition have mainly\nused the reading span test developed by Daneman and\nCarpenter (1980). Harrington and Sawyer (1992) found\na strong correlation between reading span scores and\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n264 J. Kormos and A. Sa\u00b4fa\u00b4r\nachievement on a reading and grammar test. Their\nresults with tests of phonological short-term memory also\ndemonstrated that the relationship between digit and word\nspan tasks and reading performance and grammatical\nknowledge was weak. A strong relationship between\nworking memory capacity and the acquisition of syntactic\nknowledge was also indicated by Miyake and Friedman\u2019s\n(1998) study. Mackey, Philp, Egi, Fujii and Tatsumi (2002)\nalso point at the advantage of students with high working\nmemory scores in noticing syntactic regularities, which\nsimilarly to Miyake and Friedman they explain with\nreference to the attention regulating function of working\nmemory.\nAs we have seen, there is convincing research\nevidence for a relationship between phonological short-\nterm memory and working memory capacity and\ncertain aspects of foreign language learning, but to our\nknowledge, the differential role of phonological short-\nterm and working memory in the acquisition of the\nfive major constituents of second language competence:\nlinguistic knowledge (including vocabulary and syntax),\nreading, writing, speaking and listening skills has not\nbeen investigated within a single study using relatively\nlarge number of participants. In our research we were\nnot only interested in whether phonological short-term\nand working memory capacity exert different influence\nin second language acquisition, but also aimed to\nreveal whether phonological short-term memory shows\na different relationship with L2 performance in the case\nof two groups of secondary school students taking part in\nan intensive language training program: those who were\nbeginners at the end of the school-year and those whose\nlevel of proficiency was judged to be pre-intermediate in\nSeptember. Our research questions were the following:\n1. Is there a difference in the role of phonological short-\nterm memory capacity between lower and higher level\nlearners?\n2. How does phonological short-term memory capacity\ninfluence the acquisition of vocabulary, grammar,\nreading, writing, speaking and listening skills?\n3. Do the two different measures of verbal working\nmemory capacity (non-word repetition and backward\ndigit span) contribute differentially to the acquisition\nof vocabulary, grammar, reading, writing, speaking\nand listening skills?\n3. Method\n3.1 Participants\nOur research was conducted in a Hungarian\u2013English\nbilingual secondary school in Budapest. The participants\nwere so-called zero-grade students, who took part in\nan intensive language training program from September\nto June, in order to achieve a level of proficiency in\nEnglish which enables them to be instructed in English\nin several subjects during their secondary school studies.\nThese students would be ninth graders in a conventional\nHungarian secondary school, and their age was between\n15 and 16 years.\nIn order to ensure sufficient number of participants,\nthe study was conducted in two consecutive years. Out\nof the 144 students enrolled in the program, 121 students\nparticipated in the study (the 23 students were excluded\neither because their L1 was not Hungarian, or because\nthey were not present at one of the testing occasions),\n52 participants were male and 69 students were female.\nTwenty-one students in the program had learned English\nbefore coming to the school, and they began learning from\nthe pre-intermediate level in September. 100 students had\neither not learned English in primary school, or the level\nof proficiency they reached was assessed as elementary in\na placement test, and therefore they started from beginner\nlevel.\nThe students studied English in eleven small groups\n(9 beginner and 2 pre-intermediate) and they were taught\nby five teachers who collaborated very closely. The\nteaching method was communicative combined with\nfocus-on-form instruction.\n3.2 Procedures\nWe used a non-word span test to measure students\u2019 short-\nterm memory capacity and a backward digit span test\nto assess working memory capacity. The non-word test\nwas administered at the end of the academic year in\nMay in both years. The backward digit span test was\nonly used in the second year, after the results with the\nphonological short-term memory test in the first year\nshowed a weak relationship between L2 achievement and\nnon-word repetition scores. Due to the fact that all the\nstudents in the second year of the study when this test was\nadministered were beginners, this test was not taken by\nlearners at a higher level of proficiency. As their end-\nterm exam, the students completed a Cambridge First\nCertificate language exam, which was identical in both\nyears. We used the results of this test as the measure\nof second language proficiency. Results on the two tests\nwere correlated. For the statistical analyses we applied the\nSPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 13.0 for\nWindows software.\n3.3 Tests of working and phonological short-term\nmemory\nThe backward digit span task, which intended to measure\nstudents\u2019 working memory capacity, was adapted from\na Hungarian version of the digit span test (Racsma\u00b4ny,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nWorking memory in intensive language learning 265\nLuka\u00b4cs, Ne\u00b4meth, and Ple\u00b4h, 2005). Students were tested\nindividually by the two authors in a quiet room. Backward\ndigit span was calculated as the sum of the highest number\nof digits the participants were able to repeat correctly at\nleast twice.\nThe Hungarian version of the non-word span test was\ndeveloped by Racsma\u00b4ny et al (2005). It consists of 36\nnon-words which conform to the phonotactic rules of\nHungarian. The non-words are presented in a specific\norder, and participants have to repeat them one by one.\nEach non-word consists of one to nine syllables, and a set\nof four non-words corresponds to each number of syllables\n(the sets are not presented together). We recorded the\ntest material with a digital voice recorder and presented\nit using portable CD players. Each student was tested\nseparately in a quiet room by the authors of the article.\nOn the basis of the participants\u2019 performance, their\nnon-word span was calculated, which is the highest\nnumber of syllables the participant can repeat in 50%\nof the cases (at least two times). This is the most widely\naccepted indicator of phonological short-term memory\ncapacity. However, as we found that this indicator was\nsometimes contradictory (for instance when a participant\nrepeated two seven-syllable words but only one six-\nsyllable word), we also used the weighted average of\nthe number of repeated syllables, which differentiates\nbetween two participants with a seven-syllable non-word\nspan if one repeated all the words below the eight-syllable\nlevel, and the other failed to repeat some of the words with\nlower number of syllable. Waters and Caplan (2003) also\nrecommend the use of both span and score calculations in\ntests of verbal working memory.\nWe selected the non-word span test because of\nits attested validity in assessing phonological short-\nterm memory capacity (Baddeley, 2003; Gathercole,\n2006). Our decision to use an L1 based non-word\nrepetition test was motivated by the fact that L2 non-\nword repetition ability is influenced by the knowledge\nof the phonological regularities of the L2 (Cheung,\n1996; Masoura and Gathercole, 1999), therefore any\ncorrelation found between L2 non-word repetition ability\nand proficiency test scores might be the result of the fact\nthat L2 non-word repetition ability itself is also an indirect\nmeasure of L2 competence.\n3.4 Cambridge First Certificate Exam\nThe students\u2019 end-term exam was a Cambridge First\nCertificate Exam, which was administered by the teachers\nof the school. The written paper consists of reading and\nlistening comprehension, composition, and Use of English\ntest. The reading and listening comprehension sections\ncontain three texts each, accompanied by multiple-choice\nitems and questions requiring short answers. In the\ncomposition task students had to write in three different\ngenres, which were evaluated based on their content and\naccuracy. The oral exam consisted of an interview, a\npicture description task and a problem-solving task in\npairs. Students\u2019 performance both in the writing and\nspeaking component was assessed independently by two\nteachers who did not teach the students during the school\nyear. The teachers participated in a rater training session\nprior to the exam and final scores were agreed on by\nboth teachers. The Use of English test measured students\u2019\nknowledge of vocabulary and grammatical constructions.\n4. Results\n4.1 An overview of the general characteristics of the\nparticipants\nAs far as the phonological short-term memory capacity\nof the students is concerned, the results show that\nthe students\u2019 non-word span was relatively high. The\nparticipants were able to repeat 7.18 syllables, which\nis higher than the national average of this age group as\nfound by Racsma\u00b4ny et al. (2005), whose participants aged\nbetween 12 and 16 scored 5.17 syllables. Our students\u2019\nnon-word span is even higher than that of the adult\nHungarian national average (6.85 syllables \u2013 Racsma\u00b4ny\net al., 2005). In our sample, 56.2% of students scored\n7 syllables and above, whereas in the corresponding age\ngroup in the national sample only the highest 10 percentile\nof the population was able to repeat 7 syllables. The\nstandard deviation in our population is somewhat lower\nthan that of the same age group in Racsma\u00b4ny et al.\u2019s study\n(see Table 1).\nThe distribution of the scores closely approximates the\nnormal curve, although it is slightly negatively skewed.\nThis suggests that we can regard the distribution of\nnon-word span in our sample as normal. Among our\nparticipants, seven students reached the maximum score\nof nine syllables, and 32 learners were able to repeat\neight syllables (see Table 2). Most students (N = 68) fell\ninto the seven-syllable range. 56.2% of the participants\nscored in the average range, while 11.2% of the learners\nwere below and 32.2% above the average in terms of\ntheir non-word span. One student could only repeat\nwords consisting of four syllables, while eight students\nhad a five-syllable working-memory span. This shows\nthat there is enough variation in the non-word span\nof the participants to carry out meaningful analyses of\nthe relationship of verbal working memory capacity and\nsecond language proficiency. If we compare the students\nwho were judged to be beginners in September and those\nwho were identified as pre-intermediate learners, we find\nno significant differences in their phonological short-term\nscores (see Table 4). No significant difference in the non-\nword test scores of male and female students could be\ndetected either (t = 0.79; p = 0.43).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n266 J.

Our selection of a non-parametric\ntest was motivated by the fact that the number of students\nin the two groups was very different (21 learners in the pre-\nintermediate and 100 students in the beginner group). In\norder to reduce the probability that significant differences\nare found between groups due to the repeated use of\nthe same statistical procedure, the method of Bonferroni\ncorrection was applied when establishing the significance\nlevels. The results show that the pre-intermediate group\nachieved significantly more points in every component of\nthe exam except for the reading paper (see Table 4).\nThe students who were beginners when the intensive\nlanguage teaching program started scored 23 points less\nout of the maximum number of possible points (221\npoints) than their more advanced peers. As the standard\ndeviation figures suggest, the group of beginning learners\nwas more heterogeneous in terms of proficiency than\nthe pre-intermediate group. Even though the two groups\ndiffer only by 23 points, which is approximately 10% of\nthe possible maximum score, the effect size calculation\nshows that the difference between the two groups is large\n(Cohen\u2019s d = 1.25). For this reason and also because the\ntwo groups followed different patterns of development:\none from beginner to near upper-intermediate level,\nand the other from pre-intermediate to high upper-\nintermediate level, we treated the two groups as separate\nwhen analyzing the relationship of phonological short-\nterm memory and language proficiency test scores.\n4.2 The relationship of phonological short-term\nmemory and proficiency test scores\nIf we perform correlational analyses to establish the\nrelationship of phonological short-term test scores and\nresults in the various components of proficiency test in\nthe case of the beginner and pre-intermediate group, the\nfollowing findings emerge. As regards the students who\nwere beginners at the start of the school-year, it can be\nseen that performance on the non-word test does not\nseem to be an important factor in explaining success at\nthe end of the term test since no significant correlation\nemerged between measures of phonological short-term\nmemory and achievement on the various components of\nthe language test (see Table 5).\nIn the case of the learners who were judged to be\nat the pre-intermediate level in September, the average\nnon-word score is moderately correlated with students\u2019\nperformance in the Writing and Use of English paper and\nwith the total number of points students achieved in the\ntest. Among the components of the oral test, average non-\nword score was found to be significantly correlated with\nthe number of points students received for their fluency\n(r = 0.46; p = 0.03) and range of vocabulary (r = 0.57;\np = 0.01).\nIn the case of the backward digit span, however, it\nwas found that the relationship of all the sub-tests and\nbackward digit span is statistically significant with the\nexception of the writing component.

Discussion\nOur results provide support for the assumption that\nthe phonological loop and general working memory\nare distinct constructs since we found no meaningful\ncorrelations between performance on the backward digit\nspan and the phonological loop task. This finding\nis in line with the results of studies conducted by\nGathercole, Tiffany, Briscoe, Thorn and ALSPAC team\n(2005) and Gathercole, Alloway, Willis and Adams (2006)\nthat indicate that phonological short-term memory and\nTable 5.

While\nphonological short-term memory capacity was found\nto play no role in the foreign language acquisition\nprocesses of students starting from a beginners\u2019 level,\nperformance on the backward digit span task in this group\nshows remarkably high correlations with overall language\nproficiency test scores as well as with achievement in\nthree of the major skills: reading, listening and speaking\nand on the use of English test. If we examine the\nthree skills, what they all have in common is that they\nrequire learners to hold verbal material in phonological\nmemory as well as to carry out other cognitive processes\nsimultaneously. In the case of speaking, L2 learners\nhave to store already processed bits of their message in\nmemory while planning or linguistically encoding the next\nsegment of their utterance (see Kormos, 2006). While\nreading and listening, students also have to maintain\nprocessed bits of the text in memory as well as read or\nlisten to the next part simultaneously, otherwise they will\nnot be able to understand the text as a whole (for an\noverview of psycholinguistic processes of reading and\nlistening in L2 see Harrington, 2001). The important role\nworking memory capacity seems to play in L2 reading\nand listening in our study is not surprising given the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n268 J.

Speaking in L2 is the task that poses very\nhigh attentional demands on learners (Kormos, 2006),\ntherefore the high correlations between backward digit\nspan and speaking scores probably reflect that working\nmemory is also responsible for regulating attention in\ncognitive processing (Baddeley, 2003). As regards the\nrelatively strong relationship between performance on\nthe Use of English test and working memory scores, we\nmight assume that working memory affects the acquisition\nof syntactic and vocabulary knowledge also through its\nattention regulating function. As argued by Miyake and\nFriedman (1998) and Sawyer and Ranta (2001), attention\nis at the core of noticing and encoding both new pieces of\ninformation as well as regularities in long-term memory,\nwhich constitutes the basic mechanism responsible for\nlearning words and rules of grammar in L2.\nAn interesting finding of our study is that phonological\nshort-term memory seems to play a different role in\ninfluencing the second language acquisition processes\nof students starting from the beginners\u2019 level and those\nstudents having pre-intermediate level of proficiency at\nthe beginning of the course. Our results indicate that in\nthe case of the students who were beginners in September,\nphonological short-term memory capacity is not related\nto any constituent of language proficiency. In the case of\nstudents, however, who were already at a pre-intermediate\nlevel when the school-year started, we can see that\nsignificant correlations with non-word repetition scores\nemerge in the composition task and in the Use of English\ncomponent, as well as in the case of the whole language\nproficiency test. In the case of both the composition\nscore and the achievement in the Use of English paper,\nknowledge of vocabulary and grammatical accuracy are\nthe main components that are assessed, whereas among\nthe oral test components, significant correlations only\nappear in the case of the scores awarded for the range\nof vocabulary and fluency. Unfortunately, in the case of\nthe Use of English test most tasks assess both lexical\nand grammatical knowledge in an integrated manner, and\nin accordance with the rating guidelines of the exam,\ncompositions were judged holistically. Therefore, we have\nno information on to what extent range of word knowledge\nand syntactic and morphological accuracy contributed to\nthe final points in these two tasks. Nevertheless, we might\nspeculate that at the level of competence the formerly\npre-intermediate group achieved by the end of the school-\nyear, which is high upper-intermediate, most students\ndisplay accurate and already proceduralized or perhaps\nautomatized grammatical processing. Therefore, what\ndifferentiates among them is most probably the knowledge\nof vocabulary and the ability to retrieve words quickly and\nefficiently. The hypothesis that the source of differences\nbetween students in the more advanced group lies in\nthe range of words and expressions they succeeded in\nacquiring during the school-year is also evidenced by the\nstrong correlation between scores awarded for the range\nof vocabulary and phonological short-term memory test\nresults. It seems that for higher level learners the ability\nto store verbal material in working memory plays an\nimportant role in acquiring a wide repertoire of words and\nexpressions. This finding is in accordance with earlier\nstudies which suggested that the achievement in the L1\nnon-word repetition test is a good predictor of the success\nof L2 vocabulary acquisition (Masoura and Gathercole,\n1999; Speciale et al., 2004). It is also quite likely that\nnot only the encoding of vocabulary items in memory\nis affected by phonological short-term memory capacity,\nbut the ability to access words easily and quickly, which is\nreflected in the correlation of the non-word repetition test\nand fluency scores for pre-intermediate learners. Fluency\nalso presupposes the knowledge of a sufficient number of\nready-made lexical units or formulae (Pawley and Syder,\n1983), the acquisition of which constitutes an important\npart of language learning especially at higher proficiency\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nWorking memory in intensive language learning 269\nlevels (for a recent review see Wray, 2002). The ability\nto form larger units from smaller constituents, that is,\nto chunk has been supposed to be affected by working\nmemory capacity (Zhang and Simon, 1985). Therefore\nit seems quite logical to suppose that the effect of\nphonological short-term memory capacity that manifests\nitself in the oral fluency score of the more advanced\nparticipants is also due to student variability in the ability\nto form linguistic chunks.\nOur findings contradict the results of a number of\nearlier studies, however, which found that phonological\nshort-term memory capacity plays a more important role\nin the case of less proficient speakers and its effect\ndiminishes with the development of L2 competence\n(e.g. Cheung, 1996; Speciale et al., 2004; Masoura and\nGathercole, 2005). The explanation for this contradiction\nmight lie in the different nature of learning processes\nof the two groups of students. For students to reach a\nsolid intermediate level of knowledge within a year, most\nof the learning took place through explicit instruction\nof grammatical constructions and vocabulary followed\nby practice activities in various formats. Therefore their\nlearning processes were primarily explicit, which require\nthe memorization of rules and their application. This kind\nof learning is very similar to the acquisition of literacy\nskills in the case of L1 children and even bears a lot of\nresemblance to learning mathematics. Thus, for students\nstarting from the elementary level, it was the general\nworking memory capacity that played an important role\nin influencing their success. In the case learners who\nprogressed from pre-intermediate to upper-intermediate\nlevel, this kind of explicit learning was less frequent as\nthey already acquired the majority of syntactic structures\nin primary school, and their learning processes were more\nimplicit. If we consider studies on the relationship of\nphonological short-term memory and vocabulary learning\nboth in L1 and L2, it is exactly the implicit learning of\nwords that seems to be influenced by non-word repetition\nability (Masoura and Gathercole, 2005). Students at the\nintermediate level acquire a high number of words through\nincidental exposure in reading and listening texts, and this\nacquisition process is aided by high phonological short-\nterm memory capacity.\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper we explored the role of verbal working\nmemory capacity in the success of the acquisition\nof various language skills and competencies during\na one-year long intensive English language training\nprogram. Our study addressed the question of what\nthe relationship is between phonological short-term and\ncomplex working memory capacity and performance in\nan end of year reading, writing, listening, speaking and\nuse of English test. The participants of the research\nwere secondary school students aged 15\/16 in the first\nintensive language training year of a bilingual education\nprogram. Our study indicates that phonological short-\nterm memory capacity plays a different role in the case\nof beginners and pre-intermediate students in intensive\nlanguage learning. Whereas in the case of beginners\nthere was no meaningful correlation between non-word\nrepetition scores and English proficiency test results, for\nthe pre-intermediate students we found a highly significant\nrelationship between the Use of English, the writing test\nand the overall proficiency test results. The backward\ndigit span test, which is a complex measure of working\nmemory capacity, correlated very highly with overall\nEnglish language competence, as well as with reading,\nlistening, speaking and use of English test scores of\nstudents who started learning English from the beginners\u2019\nlevel.\nFrom these results, we concluded that phonological\nshort-term memory and general working memory\ncapacity plays a different role in instructed second\nlanguage acquisition. In the case of the students whose\ndevelopment proceeded from pre-intermediate to high\nupper-intermediate level the success of the acquisition of\nwords and formulaic sequences and the ability to retrieve\nand apply this knowledge efficiently was assumed to be\nrelated phonological short-term memory capacity. As for\nstudents starting from a beginners\u2019 level, complex verbal\nworking memory was supposed to aid explicit learning\nmechanisms, mirroring the role of working memory,\nwhich acts as a bottleneck in the acquisition of L1 literacy\nskills and mathematical abilities.\nSince in our study we used a Hungarian non-word\nrepetition test, our findings also highlight the important\nrole phonological and general working memory capacities\nmeasured in L1 might play in L2 acquisition. Sparks\nand Ganschow conducted a series of studies which\nindicated that L1 literacy skills serve as the foundation\nfor L2 learning (e.g. Sparks and Ganschow, 1991,\n2001). Dyslexic learners were also found to have limited\nverbal working memory capacity in addition to deficits\nin phonological\/orthographic processing (Jeffries and\nEveratt, 2004). In their case, these impaired skills and\ncapacities lead to increased difficulties in foreign language\nlearning (for an overview see Schneider and Crombie,\n2003). Our study indicates that even small variations in\nverbal working memory capacity in a group of learners\nwith no apparent learning disabilities might contribute to\ndifferential success in L2 learning.\nFrom our study it also follows that if we want\nto understand the cognitive factors playing a role in\ninstructed second language acquisition, it is important\nto investigate psychological determinants of general\nclassroom learning such as components of working\nmemory capacity as the correlations obtained in our\nstudy reach the level of relationship usually identified\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 24 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n270 J.

If\nlanguage learning is regarded be fundamentally similar to\nany other kind of learning (for the most recent discussion\nof this position see Ellis, 2006), it is perhaps more\nreasonable to seek the explanation for differential success\nin language learning in general cognitive abilities than\nto posit the existence of a construct specific to second\nlanguage learning, i.e. foreign language aptitude.\nOur study has several limitations, one of which is the\nrelatively small sample size of the group of students who\nwere above the elementary level at the beginning of the\nschool-year. The other shortcoming of our research is\nthat relatively few students fell into the low phonological\nshort-term memory range, which might result in us not\ndetecting all the significant correlations that might exist\nbetween phonological short-term memory capacity and\nL2 learning. The correlational design allows us only\nto draw conclusions concerning relationships, but it is\nimpossible to claim that verbal memory capacity is the\ncause of the differences in students\u2019 performance.\nReferences\nBaddeley, A.
