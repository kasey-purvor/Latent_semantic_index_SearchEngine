In the second of two \nrelated papers (see Witcher 2010), consideration turns from professional and popular \nvisual representations of Hadrian\u201fs Wall to the ways in which visitors physically experience \nthe monument and its landscape. The paper explores how embodied and sensory \nencounters produce and reproduce understandings which are charged with cultural and \npolitical meaning. Specifically, the elision of visitors and Roman soldiers through a process \nof embodied empathy\/sympathy is outlined. It is argued that the way in which Western \nsociety assumes familiarity with an ancestral Roman Empire actively reduces the \ninterrogative potential of encounters with the monument and limits visitors\u201f ability to reflect \non the significance of the Wall. The paper goes on to consider alternative modes of visual \nand physical engagement, drawing inspiration from virtual communities including \ngeocachers who have used Information Technology such as Global Positioning Systems \nand Web 2.0 functionality to develop innovative modes of representation and encounter. \nKeywords \nHadrian\u201fs Wall; World Heritage; landscape; embodiment; empathy\/sympathy; visitor \nexperience; reconstructions; geocaching \n 2 \nThe Fabulous Tales of the Common People, Part 2: \nEncountering Hadrian\u2019s Wall \nHadrian\u201fs Wall has become bigger, better known, better promoted, more loved, more revered than it was \nwhen I first walked it more than thirty years ago (Davies A Walk along the Wall, 2009) \nIntroduction \nOver the past decade, Hadrian\u201fs Wall has enjoyed a revival in public prominence.1 In \n2003, the long-awaited National Trail was established along the monument and three \nyears later, Hadrian\u201fs Wall Heritage Limited (HWHL) was created with aims including the \ndevelopment of a Wall \u201ebrand\u201f (Burton 2007; HWMP 2008).2 In 2005, the monument\u201fs \ninscription as a World Heritage Site (WHS) was re-designated as part of a new \ntransnational WHS, Frontiers of the Roman Empire. A number of high profile events such \nas Illuminating Hadrian\u2019s Wall in 2010 and the British Museum blockbuster exhibition \nHadrian: Empire & Conflict (Opper 2008) have brought massive international media \ncoverage and thousands of visitors. In this context, the Wall has established itself as a key \nvisitor destination in northern England as well as a focus for regional identity (Barlow \n2007).   \nThis paper presents research which draws on a range of disciplinary approaches including \narchaeology, cultural geography, and tourism and heritage studies in order to explore how \nHadrian\u201fs Wall is represented and encountered by archaeologists and the public. The first \npart of this study, Witcher (2010) considered Hadrian\u201fs Wall from the perspective of \nrepresentation with a focus on visitor photography. This second part turns to the ways in \nwhich visitors encounter the monument and its landscape with attention to cultural and \npolitical positioning. The research is informed by analysis of user-generated online \nmaterials (e.g. images from photo-sharing websites) and the results of a photo-\nquestionnaire (see Witcher 2010). This analysis identified five themes: \n a) the distinction between photograph and content, or picture and place \n b) the merging of archaeology and landscape, or Culture and Nature  \n c) colonial interpretations, for example, Roman versus Barbarian \n d) function versus meaning, or admiration versus inspiration \n e) and the use of empathy\/sympathy. \nWitcher (2010) focused on the first two themes in relation to representations of Hadrian\u201fs \nWall; the current paper turns to the third, fourth and fifth themes with a focus on encounter. \nThis division is purely arbitrary; there is a powerful recursive relationship between \nrepresentation and encounter. As such, the following section considers the ways in which \nimagery shapes expectations about encounters with the Wall. The second part of the \npaper considers how visitors physically interact with the monument and its landscape and \nhow they emotionally relate to their sensory experiences through the use of \nempathy\/sympathy. The broader influence of the Romans\u201f ancestral status for Western \nsociety is also considered. It is argued that preconceptions de-sensitize visitors to the \nsensory richness of Hadrian\u201fs Wall and serve to reproduce colonial categories which \nundervalue its complexity and resonance. In effect, expectations have become more \npowerful than experience. The final part of the paper therefore outlines some ways to \nenable visitors to disrupt their preconceptions and to re-sensitize themselves to the \nmonument and its landscape. In particular, it considers the value of virtual communities \nand Location-based Technologies to enrich these spaces with artefacts, narratives and \nbiographies.  \n 3 \nThousands of people visit \u201eHadrian\u201fs Wall Country\u201f every year, but not all are motivated by \ninterest in Roman archaeological remains. Indeed, the landscape through which the Wall \npasses attracts visitors in its own right: botanists, birdwatchers, ramblers and dog-walkers; \nthere are also prehistoric, medieval and industrial monuments to be visited. Many National \nTrail users are simply enjoying a walk or raising money for charity. It would be informative \nto study the experiences of all of these groups; some approach the Wall quite literally from \na different perspective, for example rock-climbers scaling the crags below the central \nstretch of the Wall. However, the current research limits itself to those visitors who engage \ndirectly, at whatever level, with the Roman Wall and its legacy. In no way should this be \ntaken to suggest that the value of this landscape can and should be restricted to its Roman \nheritage. Indeed, consideration will be given to how a richer long-term biographical \napproach might be developed (see also Hingley 2010; Witcher et al. 2010). \nVisiting & Encountering the Wall \nMost people find it difficult to make a logical connexion in their minds between the characters of the \nstraightforward Classical age and those of the romantic age of medieval legend. King Arthur, for example, \nseems to belong to a far more antique epoch than Julius Caesar\u2026 (Graves Foreword to Count Belisarius, \n1938) \nScholars of tourism have emphasized how visitors\u201f expectations of destinations are \npreconditioned by texts, ideas and images including marketing brands and other visitors\u201f \naccounts (e.g. Crang 2003). This phenomenon can be understood in the context of the \nclose historical association between archaeology and tourism; for example, Szegedy-\nMaszak\u201fs (1992: 116) analysis of eighteenth and nineteenth-century tourist encounters of \nthe Colosseum traces \u201cfundamentally mimetic processes, in which visitor\u201fs impressions \nare modeled on and validated by the experiences of earlier travelers\u201d. For Hadrian\u201fs Wall, \nthere is a wealth of travelogues (e.g. Bibby 2006), guidebooks (e.g. Breeze 2006; Burton \n2007), leaflets, official websites and user-generated online content. All of these shape the \npublic discourse of Hadrian\u201fs Wall. In the process, they direct visitors\u201f physical encounters \nand, however unintentionally, deny alternatives (see Crang 2006). These texts and images \nidentify the appropriate places to visit and sanction the correct way to experience them, for \nexample, suitable clothing and direction of travel (see Witcher el al. 2010: 122; generally, \nEdensor 2000). However, there can be disparities between these idealized \u201escripts\u201f and \nthe reality experienced on the ground (for visitor resistance, see Edensor 2001). For \nexample, the iconic view of Sycamore Gap on Hadrian\u201fs Wall positions the photographer \nperpendicular to the line of the curtain wall, creating a distinctive symmetrical skyline which \nframes the eponymous tree; the stone wall itself is often barely visible (Fig 1; see Witcher \n2010 for more on this image). However, walkers following the National Trail east or west \nalong the curtain wall encounter the scene quite differently (Fig 2). One bed-and-breakfast \nproprietor tells of guests who have unknowingly walked past Sycamore Gap and ask to be \ndriven back so that they can experience it properly, that is, from the viewpoint sanctioned \nby the photograph. Hence, images of the Wall and its landscape are not purely visual but \nalso represent embodied encounters, both in the past (at the moment the image was \ncreated) and in the future (anticipating visitors\u201f movement).3 \n 4 \n \nFigure 1. Sycamore Gap viewed from the south. The stone curtain wall runs along the \nskyline from left (west) to right (east). (Photo: author) \n \nFigure 2. Sycamore Gap viewed from the National Trail along the stone curtain walI, \nlooking east. (Photo: author)  \n 5 \nIt is only in the last 20 years that Sycamore Gap has become a must-see destination on \nWall visitors\u201f itineraries (see Witcher 2010) but the recursive relationship between \nrepresentation and encounter which it epitomizes has a longer history. Early antiquarian \naccounts of the Wall focused primarily on artefacts, especially inscriptions and sculpture, \nrather than the Wall\u201fs structural components or physical setting (e.g. Hepple 2003). In part, \nthis can be explained by a reliance upon information sent by local correspondents; few \nantiquarians visited in person because of distance and insecurity. During the eighteenth-\ncentury, the Enlightenment transformed this approach with attempts to document the Wall \nmore systematically and comprehensively based on first-hand experience (Hingley 2008a; \nsee Lucas 2001: 1-12 for general change of approach). However, it was not until the mid \nnineteenth-century that visitor numbers expanded to any significant level. The emergence \nof the Wall as a visitor destination was driven the Rev. John Collingwood Bruce. Following \nhis own visit in 1848, he presented an illustrated lecture to the Society of Antiquaries of \nNewcastle upon Tyne. Concerned that his \u201cpictorial representation and verbal description\u201d \nmight be considered \u201ctoo glowing\u201d (Bruce 1886: 135), the following year, he led an \nexpedition in order to allow others to verify his claims for the Wall\u201fs grandeur \n(subsequently recognized as the first Wall Pilgrimage; Birley 1961; Nesbitt & Tolia-Kelly \n2009). For Bruce, the Wall had to be encountered to be understood. Not only did this \nauthenticate his visual and verbal representation, it also legitimized his authority to speak \nand write about the Wall. The title page of his scholarly tome The Roman Wall (1853) \nproclaimed the centrality of such direct experience (\u201cdeduced from numerous personal \nsurveys\u201d); Bruce was no library-based antiquarian working from others\u201f accounts. Today, \nauthority derived from first-hand experience remains central to Wall studies. Breeze\u201fs \n(2006) revision of Bruce\u201fs popular Wallet-book of the Roman Wall (1863; later renamed \nthe Handbook) similarly asserts a thorough re-inspection of the monument. Again, the \nreader is assured that this is no desk-based exercise; his authority follows from first-hand \nexperience. Most archaeologists can be expected to have extensive familiarity with their \nsites, but perhaps the sheer scale of the Wall means that such an automatic assumption is \nunwarranted in this particular case and so it must be clearly stated. \nArchaeological fieldwork is probably the most intensive form of encounter with any \nmonument or landscape. Like Bruce\u201fs Pilgrimage, such work attempts to establish \nauthority about the Wall, on the basis of direct observation. However, the idea of \nencounter as the basis for objective and authoritative knowledge runs parallel with another \nestablished tradition: encountering the Wall as an enchanted or evocative space. For \nexample, the travelogues of visitors such as Hutton (1802) and Bibby (2006) recall the \nimagined companionship of historical figures such as the emperors Hadrian and Septimius \nSeverus. Survey questionnaires have identified a more generic but no less powerful \u201esense \nof history\u201f as an important component of visitors\u201f experience (e.g. Elliott-White & Cuthill \n1998). In each case, visitors are aware of walking in others\u201f footsteps, whether ancient or \nmore recent. For example, Davies (2009: xi) walked the Wall with Hutton\u201fs earlier account \nin hand and \u201c\u2026found it fascinating to look with so-called modern eyes at what he had seen \nand felt\u201d 170 years before. The Wall and its landscape is haunted by other people and \ntextured with their experiences. It cannot be objectively documented once-and-for-all; it \ncan be endlessly re-presented (see Richards & Clegg 2008: 15). One of the current \nmarketing strategies of HWHL plays on this subjectivity; the Wall has to be experienced \nfirst-hand to be truly appreciated and understood (HWMP 2008). Embodied encounters, \njust like representations of the Wall (Witcher 2010), therefore contain a tension between \nobjective observation and emotional response.  \nIt would be easy to map this tension as objective archaeologists and heritage managers on \none hand and subjective tourists and visitors on the other (see Ewin 2000 for this broad \ndistinction). However, this is a simplification and an impediment to understanding both \n 6 \nscholarly and public responses to the Wall and its landscape. The inadequacy of such a \nformulation is well-demonstrated by an academic review of Breeze\u201fs (2006) revision of \nBruce\u201fs Handbook: \nOccasionally, Breeze is also given to extraordinarily subjective descriptions such as near MC37 \nwhen he states \u201cthis is one of the most beautiful and evocative stretches of Hadrian\u201fs Wall where, of \nanywhere along its whole line, it is possible to feel the most empathy with the Roman soldiers \nmaintaining watch and ward over the country to the north\u201d (Rust 2007). \nHere Breeze, evoking the style of the Handbook\u2019s original nineteenth-century author, \ndares to go beyond objective description: he not only considers the aesthetic quality of the \nlandscape but also puts himself physically and psychologically in the position of a Roman \nsoldier. Further, on the basis of this embodied reflection, he asserts an interpretation of the \nWall\u201fs function, i.e. surveillance. For the reviewer, this is clearly beyond the bounds of \nacceptable academic discourse: too antiquarian in tone and too emotional in its response.4 \nPerhaps unintentionally, this criticism cuts to the heart of contemporary archaeological \nthought: does embodiment give insight into past lives? Can scholar or visitor better \nunderstand Hadrian\u201fs Wall simply by \u201ebeing\u201f there? \nOn the ground, the scripts provided by images and texts are reinforced physically and \nconceptually by footpaths, signs and interpretation panels which choreograph visitors\u201f \nmovements. In particular, as Breeze\u201fs experience illustrates, these encounters lead to the \nelision of contemporary bodies with Roman bodies. For example,  in the central sector of \nthe Wall, visitors walk along the monument on the edge of the crags, both protected by the \nstone curtain wall and empowered by its elevated vantage point. They move through a \nRoman space, defined by the Wall in opposition to a Barbarian space beyond. More \nspecifically, contemporary bodies are elided with Roman military bodies. This \u201eneo-Roman\u201f \narmy re-garrisons military structures and uses them to command the landscape visually \n(Fig 3).5 Indeed, a walk along the Wall is as much about the opportunity to view from the \nmonument, as it is to view the monument itself. Wylie\u201fs (2002) ascent of Glastonbury Tor \nidentifies a similar tension between viewing a monument and viewing from it. In the case of \nHadrian\u201fs Wall, the linear form of the monument establishes a colonial duality: insider \nversus outsider. Being on, and viewing out from, the Wall elides visitors with Roman \nsoldiers and sets them in opposition to the Barbarian beyond.  \nThe Wall scholar Sir Ian Richmond (1936: 2) suggested that \u201cevery visitor creates for \nhimself a dream world of the past, whatever his sympathies, whether in the guise of a \nPictish robber crossing the hated barrier, or a Roman soldier defending the boundary of \nhis province\u201d. In practice, the monument and the choreography of visitor movement around \nit creates identification with the Roman military. This situation is clearly illustrated by user-\ngenerated photographs of visitors viewing out from the Wall across the landscape and is \ncorroborated by comments about vistas and panoramas. Similarly, photographs of \nreconstructed sections of the stone curtain wall repeatedly show visitors on top of these \nstructures (as Roman soldiers) rather than encountering them in other ways, for example, \nfrom ground level. It would be wrong to ignore the inherent humour in these images, but \ntheir consistency is striking. The significance of these physical encounters with Hadrian\u201fs \nWall is clearly revealed when compared to the Berlin Wall. In November 1989, being on \nthe Berlin Wall was an unambiguously political act of popular appropriation which \nemasculated the barrier by denying its function. The chronological remoteness of the \nRoman period may blunt the resonance of being on Hadrian\u201fs Wall, but the encounter is \nno less politically significant; in this case, however, visitors do not break the Wall down but \nrather re-garrison the frontier and restore it to its former perceived function. 6 \n 7 \n \nFigure 3. Pilgrims on the Thirteenth Decennial Hadrian\u2019s Wall Pilgrimage at Steel Rigg. \n(Photo: author) \nThe transfiguration of contemporary bodies into Roman bodies dissolves any distinction \nbetween scholarly and popular encounters. Their aims and methods are the same: \nunderstanding the past through sensory experience. In using embodied encounters, \narchaeologists and visitors are empathizing, that is, seeking to understand others through \nshared experiences. For example, on Hadrian\u201fs Wall, modern visitors frequently express \nempathy with Roman soldiers in relation to the northern climate.7 As with many visitor \nhabits on Hadrian\u201fs Wall, this practice is part of a long-established tradition: 150 years \nago, Bruce (1853: 90) used empathy to suggest that the garrison of Lingones, recruited \nfrom the Burgundy region, would have found the \u201csunny slope\u201d of their fort at Wallsend \n(Segedunum) \u201cpeculiarly acceptable\u201d. \nA key explanation for the ease with which visitors and archaeologists use sensory \nexperience to empathize is Western society\u201fs familiarity with the Roman past. Both \nscholars and the wider public relate quite differently to the cultural legacy of the Roman \nperiod in comparison to the prehistoric and medieval eras. Generally speaking, Western \nsociety assumes greater familiarity with Roman civilization because \u201ethe Romans were like \nus\u201f (Wilkinson 2001). Scholars have demonstrated the cultural and political construction of \nthis belief (see Hingley 2000); none the less, it still influences the way in which \narchaeologists themselves interact with and write about the Roman past. For example, \nwhilst prehistorians have used fictionalized empathetic narratives as critiques of the self-\nproclaimed objectivity of academic discourse (e.g. Edmonds 1999), attempts at similar \ntechniques by scholars of the Roman period risk misperception. This is because historical \nnovels (e.g. Graves 1934; Sutcliff 1954) have already created and exploited a sense of \nempathy with Roman society which has closed the distance between past and present. \nBroadly speaking, scholars and public alike empathize too readily with the Romans (see \nButterworth & Laurence 2005 and Hopkins 1999 for interesting examples of fictionalized \nnarratives).  \n 8 \nA decade ago, Tarlow (2000: 723) noted the limited discussion of empathy in the \narchaeological literature (but see Hodder & Hutson 2003: 161; Shanks & Tilley 1992: 15-\n17); this situation has not substantially changed over the subsequent ten years. The \ndegree to which archaeological interpretation must rely upon some form of empathy \nrequires more attention. There is a similar dearth of literature on empathy in relation to \ncontemporary visitors at heritage sites (though see Prentice & Andersen 2007 on \u201efelt \nhistory\u201f). Arguably, an important aspect of this epistemological issue is the distinction \nbetween empathy and sympathy. The former is a way of knowing what it is like for others \nand of understanding their situation; the latter is a way of relating, of sharing feelings, or \nultimately of being that person (Butler & Rowlands 2005: 101-2). By these definitions, \narchaeologists and visitors are not empathizing with Roman soldiers but rather are \nsympathizing with them. Contemporary visitors not only share knowledge about what it is \nlike to be on the Wall but actively relate to these experiences emotionally, sharing in their \ncultural and psychological significance and, ultimately, being Roman.  \nButler & Rowlands (2005) argue that sympathy is altruistic, whilst empathy may be \nmotivated by good intentions but can also be narcissistic. However, it is arguable that \nsympathy is not always altruistic if a person\u201fs identification with one group relies on partial \nor misplaced comprehension, or if such identification occludes recognition of other groups. \nIn the case of Hadrian\u201fs Wall, if visitors sympathize strongly with Roman soldiers, there is \na danger that everyone else is ignored or grouped as an undifferentiated Other. This \nromano-centricity recreates colonial categories such as Roman versus Barbarian and \nmilitary versus civilian. Sympathy may therefore be well-meaning but the result may be \none-sided; taking someone else\u201fs part may mean that the view is partial.8 \nOne explanation for the limited discussion of empathy\/sympathy in recent archaeological \nliterature is that it has been subsumed within wider phenomenological studies. Scholars \nsuch as Tilley (1994; 2004; 2008) have argued that the sensory experiences of \ncontemporary archaeologists can be used as proxies for the experiences of past people. \nHence, an archaeologist\u201fs embodied encounter with a prehistoric monument can be \naccepted, to some extent, as equivalent to similar encounters in the past.9 Such \narchaeological applications of phenomenology have come under critique. For example, it \nis argued that the senses are culturally, not biologically, determined; in particular, \ncontemporary prioritization of sight is predicated on a fundamental reconfiguration of the \nsenses during the Renaissance (Br\u00fcck 2005). The senses are also bound to a web of \nculturally-determined emotions, historically-situated knowledge and socio-political relations \nwhich give meaning to specific sights, sounds and smells. The supposition that \ncontemporary bodies can serve as direct substitutes for past bodies therefore entails \nuniversalist assumptions (see Crouch & Desforges 2003 for similar critique of tourist \nstudies). In effect, there is a risk of colonizing the past with modern sensory perceptions \nand emotional registers. However, just as senses and emotions are not purely biological, \nnor are they entirely cultural either (Tarlow 2000). In response to the paralyzing effects of \nthis biology versus culture debate, Insoll (2007) argues for a \u201ecritical realist\u201f approach in \nwhich the emotions and senses are both biological and cultural. As humans we share \nbiological traits but these are understood socially and culturally.  \nIt should therefore be concluded that encounters with archaeological monuments, whether \nby professional archaeologists or by tourists, inevitably involve relating to other people. \nHowever, in order that modern sensibilities are not imposed on the past, it is important that \nuniversalizing assumptions are avoided. In other words, that empathy does not slide into \nsympathy. An important part of this process must be to expose and explore Western \nsociety\u201fs familiarity with the Roman past. There is need for greater self-reflection about the \ncultural and political contexts within which a Roman villa appears more directly \ncomprehensible and ancestral than a Neolithic long barrow or an Iron Age hillfort. The key \n 9 \nquestion is therefore what do archaeologists and public alike derive from visiting a \nmonument such as the Wall? Simply being there does not provide direct access to the \npast; it does not make interpretations automatically better. Rather, embodied sensory \nencounters should evoke and provide the stimulus for the narration of more complex \nunderstandings of the past.  \nWhose Wall is it Anyway? \nIt has also seemed that the wording of 1863, and even some of the sentiments of that time, had by 1963 \nbecome so dated and even so distasteful that some revision of the diction was required (Richmond Preface \nto Bruce\u201fs Handbook to the Roman Wall, 1966 Twelfth edition) \nIn her cultural history of the study of Hadrian\u201fs Wall, Ewin (2000) documents the rise of \nprofessional archaeology at the expense of altruistic amateurs and popular interest. \nHowever simplistic this characterization may be, it is clear that a decade later, professional \narchaeologists are just one of a growing group of stakeholders (see Norman 2008). \nUnsurprisingly, this diversification of ownership has been accompanied by a proliferation of \npopular media and user-generated online materials. Yet the resources reviewed for this \nstudy (see Witcher 2010) suggest that the public discourse of Hadrian\u201fs Wall remains \nrelatively narrow and traditional in focus: a military frontier, Roman versus Barbarian, a \nwild and remote landscape. There is comparatively little material which captures the \npotential richness of the monument in terms of contemporary social concerns. Similarly, \nlittle of the academic debate of the last two decades appears to have impacted. Hence, \ndespite the multiplication of stakeholders, there has not been a clear diversification of \nperceptions. If anything, the New Media has fossilized the discourse: as existing \nknowledge is recycled it acquires authority through repetition and ease of accessibility (see \nJansson 2007 and Jamal & Kim 2005 for heritage perspectives on discourses of power). \nPut simply, more people are talking, but they are saying the same things. Arguably, there \nhas been an inversion of the relationship between professional and public as outlined by \nEwin (2000) whereby an explosion in the quantity of user-generated material, popular \nbooks, novels and newspaper articles disguises a restatement of the hegemonic \ndiscourse. To be clear: it is invidious to blame the public for a lack of imagination or for not \nkeeping pace with academic debate. Rather, this phenomenon is a comment on the \npotentially stifling, as well as liberating, effects of the New Media in reinforcing the status \nquo.10  \nThe hegemonic discourse of Hadrian\u201fs Wall has several strands, two of which are \ndiscussed here: the function of the Wall and the perception of the \u201eRomans as us\u201f. Firstly, \nwhereas prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge are popularly perceived as \nmysterious and romantic, the Wall is understood as explicable in purely functional terms: \ndefensive, military domination, delineation, the expression of power \u2013 or more mundanely, \nas a building project to keep soldiers busy.11 Rather than inspiration, a more common \nresponse to the Wall is admiration of its engineering and organizational achievement. This \npervasive myth of functionality strips the Wall of its potential interpretive richness. The \napparently inevitable and innocuous question of the Wall\u201fs function directs attention away \nfrom the articulation of other interpretations. In fact, the emphasis on functionality closely \nechoes the dominant concern of academic archaeology through to the 1980s and, to some \nextent, even today. By the mid twentieth-century, a belief had emerged within some parts \nof academia that Hadrian\u201fs Wall was finished business; the form of the Wall had been \ndocumented and its function explained. Sir Mortimer Wheeler allegedly claimed that all the \nquestions about the Wall had been resolved and it only remained \u201cto dot the i\u201fs and cross \nthe t\u201fs\u201d.12 Contesting the stifling belief that form and function are the only important \nquestions to be addressed has been an ongoing challenge within the academic community \n(e.g. Hingley 2008b; James 2002) and it is therefore hardly surprising that functionality \nshould continue to dominate wider public discourse.  \n 10 \nSecondly, both academic and popular responses to the Wall draw heavily on the concept \nof the \u201eRomans as us\u201f. The archaeological and textual evidence for roads, rectilinear \nhouses, central-heating, literacy and government are all taken to affirm a shared \ngenealogy (Hingley 2000; Wilkinson 2001). As with functionality, this starting premise \nnegates the need for further explanation; there is no need to seek ways of understanding \nothers because the Romans are held up as a mirror. Through schooling and popular \nculture, Western society had grown over-familiar with the Romans and hence overlooks \nthe many points of difference: language, family relations, political organization, slavery, \nand animal sacrifice. In effect, the otherness of the Romans is culturally neutralized and \none effect is to depoliticize the Wall. Frontiers are always contentious, yet the political \nsignificance of the Wall is at best occluded and at worst deliberately obscured. By \nassuming similarity between the Roman past and the present, a problematical and \nembarrassing frontier is internalized; engineering achievement is prioritized over colonial \nviolence (see Creighton 2007 on the problems of walls as heritage). The assumption that \nthe Roman past reflects the present does a disservice to the people of the past whose \nlives are appropriated; it also reduces the potential cultural and social resonance of the \nWall to contemporary society.  \nBut what if visitors\u201f encounters and representations do reproduce and perpetuate what \nmany professional archaeologists consider to be outdated or at least a biased set of ideas \nabout Hadrian\u201fs Wall? Do the \u201efabulous tales of the common people\u201f (Camden 1607; see \nWitcher 2010) demand equality? To what degree should archaeologists question or correct \ninaccuracies, politically undesirable interpretations or even deliberate manipulations of the \nevidence? The contributors to a recent volume on multiple narratives strongly welcome \narchaeology\u201fs new plurality but also broadly concur that there can be wrong interpretations \nand that professional archaeologists do have responsibilities to question them (Habu et al. \n2008; esp. Silberman 2008). This professional responsibility is reiterated by Tarlow (2000: \n729) in relation to empathy: \u201cwe can and should challenge emotional anachronism in both \nscholarly and popular accounts of the past\u201d. Indeed, if archaeologists do not interpret the \npast and influence public understanding, then professional archaeology is reduced to the \nmechanical application of method. The (at best) didactic ambitions and (at worst) \nexclusionary practices of past generations of scholars demonstrate the need for care. \nHowever, questioning bad interpretations is not synonymous with sanctioning a definitive \npast. The aim should not be to impose the correct interpretation but rather to enable \npeople to engage with multiple possibilities. Two changes which would facilitate more \nprofound engagement with the complexity and richness of Hadrian\u201fs Wall are de-\nfamiliarizing the Romans and contextualizing questions about the Wall\u201fs function with \ngreater emphasis on meaning. \nVisitor as Archaeologist? \nThere is an affliction known as Wall Fever which besets many visitors to these old fortifications and results \nfrom enthusiasm and imagination, and a passionate urge to discover more. This is a healthy and rewarding \npursuit. (Wainwright Pennine Way Companion, 2004) \nTourist studies have noted that many visitors to destinations express no surprise or \nastonishment because they have already experienced them virtually before they travelled \n(Crang 2006). Visitors\u201f preconceptions are fulfilled; the hermeneutic circle is closed. \nFocussing specifically on heritage sites, Copeland (2002) argues that visitor experience \nshould be more disruptive, troubling and inspiring; it should encourage pause for thought \nrather than simply reaffirm preconceptions. An example of this problem is provided by \nconsultation exercises on Hadrian\u201fs Wall which seek the public\u201fs ideas about future \ndevelopment of tourist provision. Many respondents say that they do not want anything \ndifferent \u2013 they want more of the same (e.g. Kinghorn & Willis 2008).13 In particular, \nvisitors request more excavation and more military re-enactment events. It is important to \n 11 \nrecognize that these responses are conditioned by prior expectations. Archaeology is \npopularly understood as synonymous with excavation; likewise, re-enactment is an \nexpected activity at heritage sites. Demands for more are shaped in dialogue with powerful \nbrands and wider social expectations about archaeology and heritage sites (Holtorf 2007). \nWithout doubt, both excavation and re-enactment are important modes of public \nengagement, but they are not the only possibilities. In terms of disrupting such \nexpectations and challenging preconceptions, more excavation and re-enactment alone \nare insufficient. Re-enactment provides an interactive visitor experience which may \u201ebring \na site to life\u201f, but it also has the effect of closing the conceptual space between visitor and \nRoman. There is a danger that re-enactment confirms expectations of the \u201eRomans as us\u201f. \nVisitors can communicate with re-enactors directly; they can feel the weight of weapons \nand admire physical strength, or watch cavalry practice and marvel at horsemanship. \nHowever, in the process, the less palatable aspects of Roman military life recede into the \nbackground. The problem is not re-enactment per se, but rather the belief that infinitely \nmore re-enactment is infinitely better. \nIn recent years, a series of events have raised the profile of Hadrian\u201fs Wall. Some have \nemployed tried-and-tested techniques such as re-enactment (e.g. The Living Frontier, \n2009). Others have developed innovative approaches such as Singing in the Bath in 2007 \nand Illuminating Hadrian\u2019s Wall in 2010; these have developed more creative \nengagements with the monument, opening space for imagination and inspiration. Such \nstaged events have achieved national and international publicity as well as local \npopularity, but their cost means that they can only form a limited strand of overall public \nengagement.  \nSuch events aside, how can visitors be encouraged to question preconceptions and to \nlook critically at the realities of the monument and its landscape? The approach suggested \nhere focuses on \u201eenabling\u201f. By encouraging visitors to use their sensory experiences rather \nthan preconceptions to formulate questions, encounters can become transformative. A \nvital part of such an approach is to distance the Romans so that differences as well as \nsimilarities can be perceived. Visitors must be allowed to appreciate the full biography of \nthe monument. The Hadrian\u201fs Wall \u201ebrand\u201f has concentrated public perception on a few \nshort centuries of Roman occupation. But the Wall is not just a Roman frontier; it also has \n1600 years of post-Roman history (see Hingley et al. forthcoming). It is a landscape \nthrough which to learn about Conversion, Border Reivers and Victorian antiquarians as \nwell.  \nAn important way of enabling visitors to get more out of the monument must be to dispel \nthe popular belief that archaeology equals excavation. The expectation that there will be \nongoing large-scale excavation on Hadrian\u201fs Wall is pervasive and hence the absence of \nsuch fieldwork for more than 20 years is noticed by visitors (Kinghorn & Willis 2008).14 \nExcavation is critical for the generation of new data but it is also expensive and must be \nproblem-driven in order to preserve a finite resource; the number of active excavations will \ntherefore always be limited compared to the number of visitors and the size of the \nmonument as a whole. But liberated from the belief that excavation is the only means \nthrough which to discover and understand the past, visitors can become landscape \narchaeologists. Just as Web 2.0 has transformed consumers into producers of knowledge, \nit is possible to recast the visitor as investigator, actively asking questions and seeking \nanswers through sensory embodied encounter with the monument and its landscape. \nWalking becomes a medium of discovery, raising questions and creating connections. For \nexample, as visitors move around monument and landscape, they may become unusually \naware of their bodily requirements for food, rest and shelter; the scarcity of toilets and the \nstamina needed to climb hills may underscore personal limitations and abilities of others. \nWhilst most other WHSs smooth away these inconvenient needs through the provision of \n 12 \nfacilities, the inability to do this at a monument of the size and complexity of Hadrian\u201fs Wall \nmeans that such requirements are accentuated. In some respects, these visitors might be \nunderstood as \u201edwelling\u201f. They are not simply viewing but engaging with the landscape in \npursuit of their basic needs (on \u201etaskscape\u201f, Ingold 2000; see also Crang 2006; Crouch & \nDesforges 2003).  \nThe value of such experiences is easily lost through sympathy. For example, the cold, rain \nand wind encountered on a visit to Hadrian\u201fs Wall often leads to sympathy with sun-loving \nItalians posted far from home on the northern frontier (see Auden 1966 Roman Wall \nBlues).15 However, this sympathetic response (I\u201fm a cold Roman soldier) is closed; there is \nnowhere else to go. A looser empathetic response is open; it allows for questions. As we \nbrave the weather, we might ask how Romans soldiers kept warm and dry. Did they really \nwear tunics and sandals? Or did they wear trousers and shoes? Instead of admiring the \ningenuity of Roman \u201ecentral heating\u201f (i.e. hypocausts), we might note that such technology \nwas generally restricted to bath-houses; domestic spaces were probably heated by \nbraziers. More self-aware of how central-heating has changed our own perceptions, we \nmight think about the inefficiency and risk of soldiers lighting dozens of fires in the densely-\npacked barrack blocks of a Roman fort. Similarly, struggling to make ourselves heard over \nthe prevailing wind, we might wonder how troops were mustered and orders \ncommunicated around a large, windswept fort. Searching for lunch, we might wonder how \nsufficient food was grown and supplied to the hundreds of soldiers and their families \nstationed along the Wall. \nIn each of these cases, it is empathy rather than sympathy which allows these questions to \nbe asked. An excellent example of this subtle difference concerns the well-preserved \nRoman latrine at Housesteads fort. The National Trust (2009) prominently advertises this \ncommunal toilet as an example of sophisticated Roman plumbing and hygiene (\u201cone of the \nearliest-known flushing toilets in Britain\u201d). Visitors are presented with a multilingual \ninterpretive panel including a reconstruction painting (Fig 4). The latrine is the subject of \nseveral such imaginative representations; the best-known is by Ronald Embleton (Graham \n1988: 18; Fig 5). The latrine is highly popular with visitors. Such Roman toilets grab our \nattention because, as Hobson (2009: ix) has recently noted, \u201ceverybody has a degree of \npersonal knowledge and experience\u201d; we can all imagine their use. But beyond \nsympathetic admiration for the latrine\u201fs sophistication (implicit recognition of its ancestral \nstatus to our high standards of sanitation), the structure evokes many questions: privacy \n(there are no partitions), gender (did women use these facilities too?) And did Romans \nreally use sponges instead of toilet paper? Such questions are regularly voiced by visitors \non the latrine\u201fs threshold and demonstrate that this building has more demonstrable power \nto engage visitors than any other at the extensive Housesteads site. Arguably the \nexplanation for the depth of engagement is that visitors have suspended sympathy and \nreverted to empathy. The elision of visitor and Roman is disrupted sufficiently to allow \nspace for questions to be posed; for a moment, visitors are modern individuals again, \nfeeling slightly confused in someone else\u201fs world. As such, the Housesteads latrine holds \nlessons for how empathy rather than sympathy can evoke questions. \n 13 \n \nFigure 4. Latrine at Housesteads fort with interpretation panel.

Reconstruction of latrine at Housesteads fort by Ronald Embleton (from Graham \n1988: 18) \nProvoking Questions \nA book like this has the singular privilege of not lying still all its days indoors, but travelling with its owner and \nsharing his fortunes of wind and weather (Collingwood Preface to Bruce\u201fs Handbook to the Roman Wall, \n1933 Ninth edition) \nThis final section considers two ways in which visitors might be liberated from the \nstraightjacket of functionality, sympathy and colonialism, in order to engage with the \narchaeological landscape of Hadrian\u201fs Wall more deeply. These are reconstructions and \nFigure 5 unavailable for copyright reasons. \n 14 \nInformation Technology. The building of life-size reconstructions of Hadrian\u201fs Wall has \nbeen popular with visitors and considered an effective means of communication (on \nsimulacra, Hobley 1982; on reconstructions as representations, Witcher 2010; on \ncontroversy, Birley 2009: 36-7; Blockley 1999). One reason for their success is that they \nappear to be definitive and authentic visions of the past. Unlike the ruined archaeological \nremains, they are tangible and complete. In particular, the authenticity of these \nreconstructions is guaranteed by the solidity of the stone and concrete from which they are \nbuilt. This monumentality employs the exact same psychology as that behind the original \nRoman structures; scale and solidity are used to communicate an unambiguous message \nof authority (on neo-Roman monumentality, see Hingley et al. forthcoming).  \nThis perceived completeness is problematical for two reasons. Firstly, it is impossible for \nany reconstruction to be truly complete by its very nature. The reconstructed bath-house at \nWallsend (FIG 6) provides an evocative experience of built space, but there is little \nquotidian clutter: there are few wooden buckets or woollen towels, glass flasks for oil or \nsandals to protect feet on the heated floors. The rich detail witnessed by Roman artefacts \nin museum displays is absent. The dioramas inside the reconstructed barracks and \ncommanding officer\u201fs house at South Shields (Arbeia) incorporate much more portable \nmaterial culture. However, the addition of ever more visual detail neglects the other \nsenses: the bath-house has no extremes of temperature between the hot room (caldarium) \nand cold room (frigidarium), nor the sounds of splashing water or the smell of sweat and \nperfumed oils (for consideration of lived experience and archaeological interpretation, see \nCharest 2009). Yet, even if such infinite detail and full sensory immersion could be \nsupplied, the bath-house would still be incomplete because ultimately visitors can never \nexperience it as a Roman would. Much of our sensory experience of the contemporary \nworld is minutely managed: for example, electric lights, double-glazing and air-conditioning \ndiminish our perception of light, noise, temperature and weather. Our everyday sensory \nexperience of the world is fundamentally different to that of past peoples. The smell of a \ncess-pit may not change through time, but it will effect quite different responses in past \nand contemporary societies because the cultural contexts are radically different. Hence, \ncreating and giving greater awareness to authentic sounds, smells and sensations can \nnever provide direct insight into past lives. A fully authentic reconstruction is illusory. \nSecondly, the perceived completeness of reconstructions is problematical because \narchaeologists do not agree on every aspect of the Wall\u201fs original form. The definitive \nstructures encountered by visitors therefore conceal much academic debate. Taking the \nstone curtain wall as an example, there has been no attempt to build alternative \nreconstructions side-by-side; to find competing versions it is necessary to visit several \ndifferent sites, many kilometres apart.16 In effect, visitors are dissuaded from engaging \nmore deeply because the definitive and monumental forms encountered at any one time \ndefy contestation. Two or more competing versions on the same site would have more \npotential to stimulate visitor curiosity. Less authority is sometimes more engaging.  \n 15 \n \nFigure 6. Reconstructed bath-house at Wallsend, with remains of barrack blocks in \nforeground. The structure is positioned immediately outside the (invisible) boundary of the \nWorld Heritage Site. (Photo: author) \nA specific issue in the context of Hadrian\u201fs Wall is that the structures selected for \nreconstruction have prioritized particular components of the frontier \u2013 i.e. the stone curtain \nwall and individual fort buildings. This is partly a requirement for low-maintenance, \nweather-proof heritage attractions, but there is a danger that these select structures simply \nfulfil prior expectations about the monument\u201fs form (i.e. as a stone wall). This makes it \nharder to communicate a broader concept of Hadrian\u201fs Wall and to encourage visitors to \nexperience other parts of the WHS (see Witcher 2010). Notably, there has been no \nattempt to reconstruct the massive linear earthwork (the vallum) to the rear of the stone \ncurtain wall. There are good practical explanations \u2013 it would require huge amounts of land \nand hence great cost; but more importantly, it would lack \u201eimageability\u201f (Lynch 1960; see \nWitcher 2010). None the less, such a reconstruction would enable visitors to encounter the \nformidable scale of this impressive earthwork its own right.17 \nIn sum, reconstructions have a tendency to prioritize particular aspects of the past, \ninevitably providing an incomplete impression, but unavoidably representing that \nexperience as definitive. As with re-enactment, this is not an argument against the use of \nreconstructions; rather it is a call to make reconstructions less perfect through awkward \njuxtapositions, alternative versions and even flaws. For example, the reconstructed stone \ncurtain wall at Wallsend presents an impression of skilled engineering and precise \nconstruction. However, this contrasts sharply with the nearby remains of the original wall. \nHere, excavations revealed that the curtain wall had collapsed and been repaired \nrepeatedly during the Roman period (Bidwell 2009). When these remains are consolidated \nfor public display, the juxtaposition of an imperfect Roman wall and a perfect \nreconstruction has the potential to stimulate interesting questions about Roman military \nplanning and construction. Similarly, on the rear face of the reconstructed wall is a modern \nstone inscription which imitates the Roman \u201eepigraphic habit\u201f of commemorating building \n 16 \nworks (FIG 7). Since completion in 1997, some of the surface has been eroded away and \nthe text left partially illegible. Powerfully but unintentionally, the inscription provides a \nreminder that for every well-preserved Roman inscription in a museum, many more have \nvanished (for consideration of what else is missing, Allason-Jones 2008).  \n \nFigure 7. Modern inscription commemorating the reconstruction of a section of stone \ncurtain wall at Wallsend.(Photo: author) \nReconstructions are a popular and potentially effective mode of engagement, but they are \nalso costly and are currently prohibited within the boundaries of the WHS (HWMP 2008: \n69). Another way of engaging the public is to employ Information Technology (generally, \nsee Jansson 2007). There is a growing number of popular pursuits which involve people \nnarrating and sharing their experience of places and landscapes via digital media \nuploaded to websites. One of the most popular is geocaching which:  \n\u2026is a high-tech treasure hunting game played throughout the world by adventure seekers equipped \nwith GPS devices. The basic idea is to locate hidden containers, called geocaches, outdoors and \nthen share your experiences online. Geocaching is enjoyed by people from all age groups, with a \nstrong sense of community and support for the environment. (geocaching.com) \nPlayers hide caches of small, low value items and provide GPS coordinates and a \ndescription of the wider landscape. The latter may highlight particular points of interest \nsuch as archaeological sites or stories associated with the place. Other players download \nthe coordinates to their GPS units and attempt to locate the caches, swapping items from \none geocache to another. They then document their success (or failure) on the website \nwith photographs and discussion. Geocaching is a prime example of the nexus between \nrepresentation and embodied experience; it involves both exploring landscapes and re-\npresenting them. It is inclusive \u2013 anyone can join \u2013 but also exclusive \u2013 players must not \ndisclose geocache locations to the uninitiated (so-called \u201emuggles\u201f, in reference to Rowling \n1997). As a community, it is competitive \u2013 it values the number of geocaches found \u2013 but it \nalso stresses the quality of places to which geocachers are guided. It therefore illuminates \na broader set of social relations: the creation of bottom-up self-sustaining communities \nwhich are both inclusive and exclusive, real and virtual (surprisingly, geocaching has \nattracted little academic interest, though see Gray 2008).  \n 17 \nThere are circa one million caches worldwide, with over c.55,000 in the UK (11\/2\/10), \nincluding a significant number near Hadrian\u201fs Wall. Most of the latter have been hidden \nwithin the last four years and have been located and commented upon by thousands of \nplayers. The striking linear distribution of geocaches in this area, especially along the \ncentral stretch of the Wall, reflects the fact that most of these geocaches give particular \nemphasis to the Roman monument and its legacy. However, if Hadrian\u201fs Wall is the prime \nfocus for these geocaches, online discussion between players also ranges around wider \naspects of landscape, weather and natural history. The website as a whole therefore \nprovides a rich and dynamic resource for understanding experiences of this archaeological \nlandscape.18 As well as geocaching, there are a number of other web-based past-times \nwhich allow users to share digital media such as GPS tracks and photographs (e.g. \neverytrail.com, maps.google.com). \nMany heritage IT applications have focussed on virtual reconstructions. Just as with \nphysical reconstructions, attention is often directed towards ever more detail in order to \ngenerate a more authentic visual experience. In contrast, Malpas (2008: 206) argues that \nNew Media should focus on creating \u201cmodes of interaction that enrich and illuminate our \nunderstanding and experience of the original places\u201d. In this context, Affleck & Kvan (2008: \n278) discuss their attempts to generate virtual communities to encourage public \nengagement with and reflection on heritage sites. In this case, the researchers found it \ndifficult to stimulate involvement and they concluded that officially sponsored websites \nwere more likely to be able to generate activity than community group websites. The \nargument made here is the opposite. Heritage managers need to learn lessons from the \nsuccess of existing reflexive and self-sustaining activities such as geocaching.19  \nThe IT applications discussed so far involve using digital cameras and GPS to document \nand share information about visits. However, these practices do not involve any \ninteractivity whilst out and about in the landscape. The development of Location-based \nTechnologies (LBT) is rapidly changing this situation. GPS-enabled mobile devices can \ndeliver place-sensitive information. For example, Memory-Map (2005) already markets a \nHadrian\u201fs Wall Trail application for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) which provides a \ncommentary tailored to the user\u201fs location. Some guardianship sites on the Wall are \nlooking to provide visitors with similar technology. However, the widening ownership of \nPDAs and the development of freely-available Augmented Reality software means such \ntechnology and the information it can communicate will not remain exclusively in the hands \nof heritage professionals, leading to a proliferation of geotagged user-generated content \nwhich visitors will be able to access whilst on the Wall. As well as text, this might include \nphotographs or paintings which would allow visitors to stand where the photographer or \nartist stood and to contemplate the way in which both monument and landscape have \nbeen represented. The juxtaposition of image and reality is a powerful visual means of \ndeconstructing the notions of authenticity and timelessness on which Hadrian\u201fs Wall \ntrades. Visitors could witness the urbanization of formerly rural stretches (e.g. at Denton \nBurn, see Witcher 2010: figs 6 & 7) and the increasingly monumental form of the stone \ncurtain wall in the central sector as a result of excavation and consolidation. It would \nbecome readily apparent that the remains visible today are not the end-result of a period of \nuninterrupted decay since the close of the Roman period, as popularly-imagined, but \nrather are the culmination of 150 years of rebuilding. The juxtaposition of multiple images \nwhilst within the landscape could also encourage visitors to dwell on the blurred distinction \nof documentary and artistic photography in the Hadrian\u201fs Wall genre. For example, the \nways in which seasonality, light and framing evoke particular impressions of the monument \nand its landscape (see Witcher 2010). Such revelations are not intended to strip the \nmonument of its authenticity but rather to enrich is biography. \n 18 \nA particularly exciting possibility of such mobile technology is the opportunity to repopulate \nthe monument with artefacts. By necessity, most heritage sites are stripped of their \nportable material culture which is then displayed in a museum, often far from the site of \ndiscovery. To some extent, museums have attempted to bring the monument into their \ndisplays; for example, the life-size reconstruction at Tullie House Museum impresses the \nphysical scale of the stone curtain wall. However, the monument itself remains devoid of \nthe mass of material culture which humanizes any historical site, but particularly \ncharacterizes Roman forts. As visitors move around sites, buildings and even specific \nrooms, GPS-enabled mobile devices could supply images and details of the artefacts \npreviously discovered. Such objects would add richness to the archaeological structures \nand stimulate curiosity. For example, the presence of children\u201fs shoes might raise \nquestions about family relationships on the military frontier; the presence of jewellery in a \nbarrack block might excite enquiries about whether women were present within the fort or \nwhether jewellery was in fact worn by both men and women; the gravestone of a young \nchild might encourage contemplation of the demographical and emotional effects of high \ninfant mortality in pre-modern societies. Behind each of these examples there is much \nacademic debate (on issues of family, gender and quality of life, see Allason-Jones 2004; \nAllison 2006; Roberts & Cox 2004). There are no simple answers to be communicated to \nthe public; and this is precisely the point. Given the evidence, the public can also begin to \nengage. These are not questions of purely academic import, but have wider resonance in \nunderstanding what it is to be human and, particularly, what it is to claim \nempathy\/sympathy with the Roman past.  \nIndividually, none of the techniques outlined here will enable every visitors to find more \ndiverse meanings in the Wall. The technology is not universally available and is unevenly \nsocially distributed. Yet, uptake is growing and it is most popular amongst a group which is \ntraditionally under-represented in surveys of Wall visitors (i.e. young adults, ERA 2004: \nAppendix 2; Kinghorn & Willis 2008). However, it does begin a new process of \nengagement which builds upon existing bottom-up embodied and representational \npractices. The challenge for professional archaeologists and heritage managers is not to \nregulate user-generated content to ensure that it is accurate but rather to provide its own \nhigh-quality and accessible information which can inform public understanding and enable \nmore diverse responses to the Wall than the current hegemonic discourse allows. Such \ntechniques would incur only a fraction of the cost of establishing and maintaining the \nNational Trail and would necessitate neither intrusive physical infrastructure nor constant \nstaffing. It would also have other advantages. For example, currently there is contrast \nbetween the highly-managed guardianship sites and the stretches of Wall in between. The \nformer are created as places of education (e.g. events, interpretation panels, etc.), whilst \nthe latter are left to evoke more emotional responses. Augmented Reality could diminish \nthis difference, whilst simultaneously preserving the unspoiled character of the landscape \nwhich many existing visitors value. \nConclusions \nThe inscription of Hadrian\u201fs Wall as a WHS signals its Outstanding Universal Value. \nHowever, the Wall clearly means different things to different people \u2013 regionally, nationally \nand internationally. For many people, especially in the West, frontiers are rarely \nencountered even though people travel more. Those frontiers which are encountered are \nan inconvenience rather than a barrier. Visiting an ancient frontier is therefore an \nambiguous experience (on border tourism, see Timothy 2001; on walls as heritage, see \nSaunders 2009). It is immediately comprehensible but simultaneously alien; a site of \ninterest rather than immediate personal resonance.  \n 19 \nEach visitor brings their own biography to their embodied encounters. However, these \nideas and experiences are culturally-situated and relate to wider constellations of imagery \nand identity. The research presented in this paper and in Witcher (2010) raises issues \nabout how the public discourse of Hadrian\u201fs Wall is created and maintained with specific \nreference to the role of the New Media and the increasingly blurred nexus between \nrepresentation and encounter. To some extent, technology has fossilized understanding of \nHadrian\u201fs Wall and made it harder to diversify its meaning. In particular, Western societal \nfamiliarity with the ancestral Romans blinkers responses to this monument and its \nlandscape. Sympathy (\u201ebeing\u201f Roman) robs visitors and archaeologists alike of the ability \nto ask questions because there is no difference to explain; embodied empathy is a more \nproductive locus for historical enquiry because it provides a middle-ground between \nobjectivity and subjectivity. Sensory experiences are shared, but questions must be asked \nin order to understand them. \nThis paper has discussed ways of disrupting visitor preconceptions, such as making \nreconstructions less perfect and more problematical. Most importantly, it has pointed to a \nnumber of existing bottom-up virtual communities engaged in documenting and discussing \ntheir experience of this archaeological landscape. Arguably geocachers and others are \nalready practising a kind of landscape archaeology \u2013 observing spatial relationships, using \nembodied encounters and emotional empathy to ask questions, and creating their own \nvisual representations to convey meanings. The aim is not to argue that the New Media \nshould replace re-enactment or excavation but rather simply to recognize that such digital \nmodes of engagement are already in existence, are of growing influence, and most \nimportantly have been generated by the public. Rather than despair at the \u201etales of the \ncommon people\u201f (Camden 1607), archaeologists and heritage managers can learn from \nthese undirected and self-sustaining practices to develop new and complementary modes \nof engagement. \nAcknowledgments \nThis research stems from the AHRC-funded project, Tales of the Frontier.

The famous stone \nwall which forms just one component of this complex is distinguished here as the \u201estone curtain wall\u201f.  \n2\n Hadrian\u201fs Wall Heritage Limited is a not-for-profit company, part-funded by the One NE and North West \nRegional Development Agencies, to co-ordinate the activities of the many institutions involved in the \nmanagement of the World Heritage Site. It also manages initiatives intended to develop the local economy, \nfor example, through the promotion of tourism. \n3\n It is not only the public who are influenced by the circulation of these ideas and images. For Wall scholars, \none of the most significant discoveries of recent years has been the information which is still to be gained \nfrom examining the extant earthworks of the Hadrian\u201fs Wall system (e.g. milecastle crossings in the wall \nditch, Welfare 2004). So familiar has the monument and landscape become that even archaeologists can fail \nto comprehend some of the evidence before their eyes. Just as visitors are preconditioned to see certain \nthings, so too are archaeologists (see Bradley 2003 for a similar example at a prehistoric site). \n4\n It should be noted that Bruce\u201fs original 1863 edition was subtitled \u201cA Guide to Pilgrims Journeying along the \nBarrier\u201d and was aimed directly at the educated lay person. However, over successive editions, the \nHandbook has become a more scholarly tome. It has dispensed with directions for visitors and commentary \non other features of touristic interest in order to focus on the (Roman) archaeological evidence. As such it \nhas become a more specialist volume. The unusual evolution of the Handbook from popular to scholarly \nwork, whilst attempting to retain some of its original spirit, may account for its hybrid character against which \nRust reacts. \n5\n In understanding the planning and function of Hadrian\u201fs Wall, it has been noted that views from the stone \ncurtain wall are often as extensive to the south as they are to the north (Poulter 2009: 74). Today, the iconic \nviews of Hadrian\u201fs Wall zigzagging over multiple horizons (see Witcher 2010) obviously incorporate both \n\u201ecivilized\u201f territory to the south as well as \u201eBarbarian\u201f lands to the north. However, it is the ability to take such \nvisual command of the landscape from the privileged position of the Wall which makes this a specifically \nRoman gaze. \n6\n Visitors to heritage sites often intentionally take the highest ground to gain the best views of a monument. \nVisitors to Hadrian\u201fs Wall may therefore not necessarily be actively seeking to \u201ebe\u201f Roman (Sam Smiles, \npers. comm.). However, the argument here is not about intention but effect.  \n7\n E.g. participant responses to an image of the Wall under snow: \u201cMakes me feel sympathy for soldiers from \nwarmer climates\u201d and \u201cBleak and dramatic and conjures up condition legionaries had to contend with\u201d. See \nhttp:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/roman.centre\/hadrianswall\/phototext\/photo11\/ \n8\n It should be stressed that de-familiarizing the Romans does not simply mean evolving empathy with the \nBarbarian \u201eOther\u201f living north of the Wall. The recent promotion of a walking route to the north of Hadrian\u201fs \nWall as a \u201cBarbarian View\u201d (2009) provides a welcome alternative perspective, but ultimately underscores \nthe dominance of the romano-centric norm. A key aspect of academic studies of the past 20 years has been \nto break down the Roman versus Barbarian dichotomy in order to consider the complexity of social identities \nwhich cross-cut these colonial categories: gender, class, ethnicity and wealth. Another traditional pair of \ninterpretive categories which archaeologists have sought to diminish is military and civilian (see James \n2002).  \n9\n The early applications of phenomenology in archaeology concerned prehistoric monuments (e.g. Tilley \n1994) and most subsequent research has continued to focus on prehistory. There are few explicit \napplications to historical periods (but see Witcher 1998); Giles (2007: 109) argues that the \u201csheer wealth of \ncontextual evidence available\u2026 actually constrains historical archaeologists from adopting the more creative \nand imaginative approaches\u201d. \n 25 \n                                                                                                                                                 \n10\n More broadly, the New Media may also lead to the convergence, rather than diversification, of ideas as a \nresult of the new opportunities for the marketing. \n11\n See participant responses to the question \u201cWhy did the Romans build Hadrian\u201fs Wall?\u201d at \nhttp:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/roman.centre\/hadrianswall\/phototext\/whydid\/ \n12\n Though often quoted, it should be noted that Breeze (2003: 12) was unable to verify that Wheeler did \nindeed make this statement. The broader sentiment, however, is undoubtedly an accurate reflection of the \nperception of Hadrian's Wall studies within parts of the academic community. \n13\n In part, this response may demonstrate a classic flaw in survey method, i.e. existing visitors are likely to be \na self-selecting sample that have already chosen the destination because it fulfils their needs and desires. A \nsurvey of existing visitors will fail to capture those who have chosen not to visit because of a (perceived) lack \nof provision.  \n14\n The notable exception is the long-running annual programme of excavation conducted at Vindolanda \nRoman fort, just south of the Wall (Birley 2009). \n15\n The geographical origin of the auxiliary soldiers who garrisoned Hadrian's Wall is much discussed. The \nnames of individual units indicate that most were originally raised in Gaul, Germany and Spain with some \nfrom other parts of the Empire. It is generally assumed that these units quickly shifted to local recruiting (e.g. \nBreeze & Dobson 2000: 181) but this far from certain (see Hodgson 2009: 33-4). Nonetheless, it is clear that \ncomparatively few soldiers of specifically Italian origin were present and that the majority came from the \nNorth-western provinces. \n16\n Debated aspects include the height of the curtain wall and the presence\/absence of a crenellated parapet \nand wall-walk (see Bidwell 2008; Hodgson 2009: 42-6). Reconstructions at Vindolanda juxtapose stone and \nturf sections of the curtain wall and underscore the very different appearance of the eastern and western \nparts of the original Hadrianic system, but these are not competing interpretations per se. Some small \npatches of rendering of the rear face of the reconstructed curtain wall at Wallsend bear witness to a debate \nabout the exterior finishing of the stone wall, e.g. was it whitewashed and painted to imitate ashlar masonry \n(Breeze 2006: 55-6)? A sign draws visitors\u201f attention to these interesting possibilities, but they are far from \nprominent and the larger structure itself provides no alternative versions of debated features. \n17\n A reconstruction of this earthwork would also be a useful piece of experimental archaeology in terms of \nunderstanding the speed and complexity of construction and the subsequent erosion of the ditch and banks \nover time. For example, the reconstructed turf curtain wall at Vindolanda has settled and sagged since its \nconstruction and provides useful evidence for archaeologists studying the remains of the original structure \n(Birley 2009: 37).  \n18\n Geocachers stress responsibility towards the environment and caches must be hidden \u201cin plain sight and \nnever buried\u201d (geocaching.com). Many of the caches located close to the Wall make reference to the \nmonument\u201fs own country code Every Footstep Counts (see Burton 2007: 14). Nonetheless, heritage \nmanagers will inevitably be concerned about the possibility of damage to the monument. In response to \nsimilar concerns in other protected natural and cultural landscapes, virtual \u201eearthcaches\u201f have been \nencouraged with the aim of guiding visitors to places with an explicitly educational objective (e.g. \nearthcache.org). This virtual cache phenomenon has subsequently widened in popularity via websites such \nas waymarking.com.  \n19\n The Hadrian\u201fs Wall Management Plan (HWMP 2008: 68) provides only the briefest mention of the role of \nnew technologies for public interpretation of the Wall over the next seven year management cycle to 2014. \n"}
