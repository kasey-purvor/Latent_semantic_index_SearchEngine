INTRODUCTION\nConsider the ordinary differential equation\n\u00abx\u00a8 + x\u02d9 + \u00abx2 = \u00abfsvtd , s1.1d\nwhere vPRd is the frequency vector, fscd is an analytic function,\nfscd = o\nnPZd\nein\u00b7cfn, s1.2d\nwith average a=a2, with a.0 shence kfl; f0=ad, and \u00ab.0 is a real parameter. Here and hence-\nforth we denote with \u00b7 the scalar product in Rd. By the analyticity assumption of f there are two\nstrictly positive constants F and j such that one has ufnu\u0142Fe\u2212junu for all nPZd.\nBy writing g=1\/\u00ab the equation becomes\nx\u00a8 + gx\u02d9 + x2 = fsvtd , s1.3d\nwhich describes a nonlinear electronic circuit, known as resistor\u2013inductor\u2013varactor circuit, subject\nto a quasiperiodic forcing function. Taking d=1 and fsvtd=a+b sin t, this equation has been\nstudied in Ref. 1, where, among other things, it has been found numerically that for g large enough\nadElectronic mail: gentile@mat.uniroma3.it\nbdElectronic mail: m.bartuccelli@surrey.ac.uk\ncdElectronic mail: j.deane@surrey.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS 46, 062704 s2005d\n46, 062704-10022-2488\/2005\/46~6!\/062704\/21\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Furthermore one can prove analytically that such a periodic orbit is the only\none in a neighborhood of radius Os1\/gd around the point sa ,0d.\nHere we give some further analytical support to such numerical findings. In particular we\nshow that, if we take as forcing term an analytic periodic function,\nfscd = o\nnPZ\neincfn, f0 = a . 0, s1.4d\nthen for \u00ab small enough there is a 2p \/v-periodic solution, but this is not analytic in \u00ab=1\/g in a\nneighborhood the origin in the complex \u00ab-plane. We find that such a solution is Borel summable.\nWe also show that by considering quasiperiodic forcing terms, as in s1.3d, we still have a\nquasiperiodic solution with the same frequency vector v as the forcing term, but we can only say\nin general that such a solution is analytic in a domain with boundary crossing the origin.\nFinally we shall see that considering more general nonlinearities introduces no further diffi-\nculties, and equations like\nx\u00a8 + gx\u02d9 + gsxd = fsvtd, lim\nuxu\u2192\u2018\nugsxdu\nuxu\n= \u2018 , s1.5d\nwith g and f both analytic in their arguments, can be dealt with essentially in the same way.\nSimply, we must impose a nondegeneracy condition on the function g, which reads as\n$ x0 such that gsx0d = f0 and g8sx0d \u00de 0. s1.6d\nIn the particular case of homogeneous gsxd, that is gsxd=sxp, with p\u00f82 an integer and sPR, the\ncondition is automatically satisfied if p is odd sfor any value of sd, while it requires sf0.0 for p\neven, as assumed in s1.1d.\nThe paper is organized as follows. For expository clearness we start with the case of periodic\nforcing terms. In Secs. II and III we show that a periodic solution with frequency v in the form of\na formal power series in \u00ab sperturbation seriesd is well defined to all orders, and it admits a natural\ngraphical representation. In Sec. IV we study further such a series, and we see that there is strong\nevidence to show that it diverges seven if we cannot exclude convergence definitelyd. The best\nbounds that we are able to provide for the coefficients grow as factorials. To obtain bounds which\nallow summability of the perturbation series we must perform a suitable summation in order to\ngive the series a meaning. This is done in Sec. V, and the resummed series is found to represent a\n2p \/v-periodic solution which is Borel summable in \u00ab. To prove the latter property we rely on\nNevanlinna\u2019s improvement of Watson\u2019s theorem.12 In Sec. VI we consider the case of quasiperi-\nodic forcing terms. We find that the perturbation series is well defined if the frequency vector of\nthe forcing term satisfies a Diophantine condition, and, by using renormalization group techniques\nin order to deal with the small divisors problem, we find that the resummed series still converges\nto a quasiperiodic solution, and it defines a function analytic in a domain containing the origin in\nits boundary. We shall see that the bounds we find do not allow us any more to obtain Borel\nsummability, unlike the case of periodic forcing terms. In Sec. VII we discuss how to extend the\nanalysis to more general nonlinearities gsxd, by requiring the condition s1.6d to be satisfied.\nThe interest of the approach we propose is that it allows the use of perturbation theory which\ncan be very natural in problems in which a small parameter appears. In fact analyticity in \u00ab for \u00ab\nclose to 0 sthat is in g for g large enoughd could be proved very likely with other techniques sat\nleast for periodic solutions in the case of periodic forcing termsd, but a naive expansion in powers\nof \u00ab is prevented by the lack of analyticity in a neighborhood of the origin. On the other hand, the\nperturbation series gives a very accurate description of the solution, hence it is important to know\nthat such a series is an asymptotic series, and its use is fully justified. Finally we mention that the\nquasiperiodic solution we investigate is of physical relevance, hence it is useful to study its\n062704-2 Gentile et al. J. Math.

For instance in the case of the aforementioned resistor\u2013inductor\u2013varactor circuit in Ref.\n1, for damping large enough, the 2p \/v-periodic solution is numerically found to attract any\ntrajectory which remains bounded in phase space.\nThe techniques we use have been recently developed for problems of Hamiltonian stability,\nand are based on resummation methods that are familiar in quantum field theory ssee Ref. 7 and\nreferences quoted thereind. Here we show that they can be useful even in non-Hamiltonian prob-\nlems with viscosity acting. We leave as an open problem to show whether the formal series of the\nperiodic or quasiperiodic solutions are really divergent. We also note that we are not able to prove\nuniqueness of the quasiperiodic solutions we find by the resummation procedure, as in that case\nthere is no uniqueness result as for analytic or Borel summable functions which one can rely upon.\nFurthermore, both for periodic and for quasiperiodic solutions, we cannot exclude existence of\nother solutions with the same rotation vector, which either are of a different form or even admit the\nsame formal series, without being obtained through the same resummation procedure. Problems of\nthe same kind were met in the study of hyperbolic lower-dimensional tori.6\nII. FORMAL ANALYSIS\nConsider first s1.1d for d=1, that is\n\u00abx\u00a8 + x\u02d9 + \u00abx2 = \u00abfsvtd , s2.1d\nwith fscd given by s1.4d. We look for bounded solutions sif anyd which are analytic in \u00ab, that is of\nthe form\nxstd = o\nk=0\n\u2018\n\u00abkxskdstd . s2.2d\nInserting s2.2d into s2.1d and equating terms of the same Taylor order we find the set of recursive\nequations\nx\u02d9s0d = 0,\nx\u02d9s1d = \u2212 x\u00a8s0d \u2212 xs0d2 + f , s2.3d\nx\u02d9skd = \u2212 x\u00a8sk\u22121d \u2212 o\nk1+k2=k\u22121\nxsk1dxsk2d, k \u00f8 2.\nFrom the first equation szeroth orderd we obtain that xs0d must be constant, say xs0d=c0 with c0 to\nbe determined. The second equation sfirst orderd can give a bounded solution only if \u2212c0\n2+a=0,\nwhich fixes c0=\u02dba=a and gives xs1dstd as a periodic function with the same period of the forcing\nterm,\nxs1dstd = xs1ds0d + E\n0\nt\ndt8sfsvt8d \u2212 ad . s2.4d\nAs each xskdstd depends on the functions xsk8dstd with k8,k, we expect that if there is any periodic\nsolution then it must have the same period as the forcing term.\nTo continue the analysis to all orders it is more convenient to write the recursive equations\ns2.3d in Fourier space. The analysis to first order and the considerations above motivate us to write\nin s2.2d,\nxstd = o\nk=0\n\u2018\n\u00abkxskdstd = o\nk=0\n\u2018\n\u00abk o\nnPZ\neinvtxn\nskd\n, s2.5d\nwhich inserted into s2.3d gives for n\u00de0,\n062704-3 Summation of divergent series J.

To deduce c1=0 we used the first of s2.6d, which, inserted into\ns2.9d for k=1, gives 2c0c1=0, hence c1=0 as c0\u00de0.\nThe following result holds.\nLemma 2.1: Consider (2.1) with f given by (1.4). Then there exists a formal power series\nsolution (2.2) whose coefficients xskdstd are analytic in t. If f is a trigonometric polynomial, that is\nin (1.4) one has unu\u0142N for some NPN, then for all k\u00f80 the functions xskdstd are trigonometric\npolynomials of order fsk+1d \/2gN, where f\u00b7g denotes the integer part. This means that one has\nxn\ns2kd\n=0 and xn\ns2k\u22121d\n=0 for unu.kN.\nProof: The existence of a formal solution s2.2d, with coefficients xskdstd analytic in t for all\nk\u00f80, follows from the analysis above. If f is a trigonometric polynomial of degree N, that the\ncoefficients xn\nskd\nare trigonometric polynomials with the stated properties can be proved from s2.6d\nby induction on k. j\nThen the functions xskdstd are well defined to all orders. Before discussing the issue of con-\nvergence of the formal power series defining such functions we look for a graphical representation\nof the coefficients xn\nskd\n.\nIII. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION AND TREE FORMALISM\nWe start by giving some abstract definitions.\nDefinition 3.1 (trees): A tree u is a graph, that is a connected set of points and lines, with no\n062704-4 Gentile et al.

All the points in a tree except the root are denoted nodes.\nThe line entering the root is called the root line. The orientation of the lines in a tree induces a\npartial ordering relation between the nodes. We denote this relation by d, given two nodes v and\nw, we shall write wdv every time v is along the path (of lines) which connects w to the root.\nGiven a tree u, we can identify the following subsets in u.\nDefinition 3.2 (endpoints): We call Esud the set of endpoints in u, that is the nodes which have\nno entering line. The endpoints can be represented either as white bullets or as black bullets. We\ncall EWsud the set of white bullets and EBsud the set of black bullets. Of course EWsud\u0142EBsud\n=Esud. With each vPEWsud we associate a mode label nv=0, an order label kvPZ+ and a node\nfactor Fv=ckv. With each vPEBsud we associate a mode label nvPZ \\ h0j, and a node factor Fv\n= fnv.\nDefinition 3.3 (lines): We denote with Lsud the set of lines in u. Each line ,PLsud leaves a\npoint v and enters another one which we shall denote by v8. Since , is uniquely identified with v\n(the point which , leaves), we may write ,=,v. With each line , we associate a momentum label\nn,PZ and a propagator\ng, = H1\/sivn,d , n, \u00de 0,1, n, = 0, J s3.1d\nand we say that the momentum n, flows through the line ,. The modes and the momenta are\nrelated as follows: if ,=,v one has\nn, = o\ni=1\nsv\nn,i = o\nwPEBsud\nwdv\nnw, s3.2d\nwhere ,1 ,\u2026 ,,sv are the lines entering v.\nDefinition 3.4 (vertices): We denote by Vsud the set of vertices in u, that is the set of points\nwhich have at least one entering line. If Vsud\u00dex we call the vertex v0 connected to the root the\nlast vertex of the tree. If sv denotes the number of lines entering v call maxvPVsud sv the branching\nnumber. One can have either sv=1 or sv=2. We set Vssud= hvPVsud :sv=sj for s=1, 2; of course\nV1sud\u0142V2sud=Vsud. We define also V0sud= hvPVsud :n,v=0j; one has V0sud,V2sud. We require\nthat either V0sud=x or V0sud= hv0j, and that one can have vPV1sud only if n,v\u00de0. We associate\nwith each vertex vPVsud a node factor\nFv = 5\u2212 1, sv = 2 and v \u201e V0sud ,\u2212 1\/2c0, sv = 2 and v P V0sud ,\n\u2212 sivn,vd\n2\n, sv = 1,\n6 s3.3d\nwhich is always well defined as c0\u00de0.\nWe call equivalent two trees which can be transformed into each other by continuously\ndeforming the lines in such a way that they do not cross each other.\nLet Tk,n be the set of inequivalent trees u such that\ns1d the number of vertices, the number of black bullets, and the order labels of the white bullets\nare such that we have\nk1 + k2 + k3 = k, if n \u00de 0,\nk1 + k2 + k3 = k + 1, if n = 0, s3.4d\nif we set k1= uVsudu, k2= uEBsudu, and k3=ovPEWsudkv.\ns2d The momentum flowing through the root line is n.\n062704-5 Summation of divergent series J.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jmp.aip.org\/jmp\/copyright.jsp\nWe refer to Tk,n as the set of trees of order k and total momentum n.\nWith the above definitions the following result holds.\nLemma 3.5: For all k\u00f81 and all n\u00de0 one has\nxn\nskd\n= o\nuPTk,n\nValsud, Valsud = S p\n,PLsud\ng,DS p\nvPEsud\u0142Vsud\nFvD , s3.5d\nwhere Val:Tk,n\u2192C is called the value of the tree. For k\u00f82 and n=0 one has\nx0\nskd ; ck = o\nuPTk,0\n*Valsud , s3.6d\nwhere p means that there are two lines entering the last vertex v0 of u0 and neither one exits from\nan endpoint v with order label kv=0.\nProof: We can represent graphically x0skd=ck as in Fig. 1sad, xns1d , n\u00de0, as in Fig. 1sbd, and,\nmore generally, xn\nskd\nas in Fig. 1scd.\nThen the third equation in s2.6d can be represented graphically as in Fig. 2, if we associate\nwith the nodes and to the lines the node factors and the propagators, respectively, according to the\ndefinitions s3.1d and s3.3d.\nAnalogously s2.10d is represented graphically as in Fig. 3, again if we use the graphical\nrepresentations in Fig. 1 and associate with the lines and vertices the propagators s3.1d and the\nnode factors s3.3d, respectively.\nNote that in this way we represent graphically each coefficient xn\nskd in terms of other coeffi-\ncients x\nn8\nsk8d\n, with k8,k, so that we can apply iteratively the graphical representation in Fig. 2 until\nonly trees whose endpoints represent either xn\ns1d\nwith n\u00de0 sblack bulletsd or ck are left swhite\nbulletsd. This corresponds exactly to the expressions in s3.5d and s3.6d. j\nTo get familiar with the graphical representation s3.5d and s3.6d one should try to draw the\ntrees which correspond to the first orders, and check that the sum of the values obtained with the\ngraphical rules listed above gives exactly the same analytical expression which can be deduced\ndirectly from s2.6d and s2.10d.\nFor instance for k=2 we obtain for xn\ns2d\n, n\u00de0, the graphical representation in Fig. 4 and for\nc2=x0\ns2d the graphical representation in Fig. 5.\nFor k=3 we obtain for xn\ns3d\n, n\u00de0, the graphical representation in Fig. 6 and for c3=x0\ns3d the\ngraphical representation in Fig. 7, where we have explicitly used that c1=0.\nThis can be continued to higher orders. In general a tree uPTk,n looks like in Fig. 8, where for\nsimplicity no labels have been drawn other than the order labels of the white bullets. Note that\neach node can have only one or two entering lines, while the endpoints have no entering line at all.\nMoreover the momentum flowing through the line exiting a vertex v is equal to the sum of the\nFIG. 1. Graphical representation of x0\nskd\n, xn\ns1d\n, and xn\nskd\n. For n=0 the latter reduces to the first graph, while for k=1 and n\n\u00de0 it reduces to the second graph. In the first graph the momentum is not shown as it is necessarily n=0.\nFIG. 2. Graphical representation of the third equation in s2.6d expressing the coefficient xn\nskd for k\u00f82 and n\u00de0 in terms of\nthe coefficients x\nn8\nsk8d\nwith k8,k. In the last graph one has the constraints k1+k2=k\u22121 and n1+n2=n.\n062704-6 Gentile et al. J. Math. Phys. 46, 062704 ~2005!\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The latter is just uV0sudu=0 if\nuPTk,n, n\u00de0, and uV0sudu=1 if uPTk,0.\nIf a vertex v has sv=1, that is it has only one entering line ,, the latter cannot come out of a\nwhite bullet. Indeed if this occurs one should have n,v=n,=0, hence Fv=0 by s3.3d, so that the\nvalue of the tree containing such a vertex is zero.\nGiven a tree as in Fig. 8 we can represent each white bullet according to the graphical\nrepresentation in Fig. 3, corresponding to the analytic formula s3.6d, and expand again the two\ncontributions xn1\nsk1d and xn2\nsk2d as sums of trees, and so on, iteratively, until the only white bullets\nwhich are left are the ones with order label k=0. In this way we obtain a new graphical represen-\ntation where the trees still look like those in Fig. 8, but now there are a few differences as follows:\ns1d all the white bullets vPEWsud have order labels kv=0, and\ns2d there can be lines ,PLsud with momentum n,=0 which come out of vertices, that is V0sud\ncan contain no element or more than one element.\nNote that only lines coming out either from nodes in V0sud,V2sud or from white bullets have\nvanishing momentum.\nThe order of the tree is then given by the number of elements of Vsud\u0142EBsud minus the\nnumber of elements of V0sud, that is k= uVsudu+ uEBsudu\u2212 uV0sudu. Of course v0PV0sud if and only\nif the momentum of the root line is vanishing, that is uPTk,0 for some k\u00f82. It is important to\nstress that no line entering a vertex vPV0sud can come out of a white bullet swhich now has\nnecessarily an order label 0d, because this would be against the constraint in the sum s3.6d. This\nmeans that if two lines carrying zero momentum enter the same vertex v fso that vPV0sud\naccording to s3.2dg, then none of them can exit from a white bullet.\nBut up to these minor differences a tree representation like in s3.5d and s3.6d still holds. The\nadvantage of these modified rules is that now the tree values are expressed no longer in terms of\nconstants ck to be determined, but only in terms of c0 which is known. A tree drawn according\nthese new rules is represented as in Fig. 8 with k1=k2=k3=0 sand in particular a tree of this kind\ncan contribute only to xn\nskd\nwith n\u00de0d. Note that we could avoid drawing the order labels associ-\nated with the endpoints, as they are uniquely determined as k=0 for the white bullets and k=1 for\nthe black bullets. Of course, with respect to the caption of that figure, now the order k is given by\nthe number of elements in Vsud plus the number of elements in EBsud minus the number of\nelements in V0sud.\nFIG. 3.

FORMAL SOLUTIONS\nThe sum over the trees in s3.5d and s3.6d, with the new definition of the set Tk,n given at the\nend of Sec. II, can be performed by summing over all possible \u201ctree shapes\u201d sthat is trees without\nlabels or unlabeled treesd and, for a fixed shape, over all possible assignments of mode labels. In\nthe case of a trigonometric polynomial of degree N the latter can be bounded by s2NduEsudu, because\neach endpoint v can have either a mode label nv\u00de0, with unvu\u0142N, or the mode label nv=0, while\nthe case of analytic functions sor even to obtain bounds which are uniform in Nd must be discussed\na little more carefully. The number of unlabeled trees with P nodes svertices and endpointsd can be\nbounded by 22P.\nRecall that Vssud denotes the set of vertices v such that sv=s; of course V1sud\u0142V2sud=Vsud,\nand V0sud,V2sud. Analogously we can set\nL0sud = h, P Lsud:n, = 0,j ,\nL1sud = h, P Lsud:, = ,v,v P V1sudj , s4.1d\nL2sud = Lsud \\ sL0sud \u0142 L1sudd ,\nwith the splitting made in such a way that one has\nU p\nvPV1sud\nFvUU p\n,PL1sud\ng,U \u0142 p\n,PL1sud\nuvn,u, U p\n,PL2sud\ng,U \u0142 p\n,PL2sud\n1\nuvn,u\n,\nU p\nvPV0sud\nFvU \u0142 S 12c0D\nuV0sudu\n, U p\nvPEWsud\nFvU \u0142 c0uEWsudu, s4.2d\nFIG. 5.

If k\ndenotes the order of the tree u, that is uVsudu\u2212 uV0sudu+ uEBsudu=k, one has the identity uL1sudu\n+ uL2sudu=k, and the bounds uV1sudu\u0142k, uV0sudu\u0142k\u22121, uEsudu\u0142k and uEsudu+ uVsudu\u01422k\u22121.\nProof: It is a standard result on trees that one has ovPVsudssv\u22121d= uEsudu\u22121, so that the first\nbound follows. The bounds on uV1sudu, uV0sudu, uEsudu and uEsudu+ uVsudu can be easily proved by\ninduction, while the identity uL1sudu+ uL2sudu=k follows from the observation that all lines in L1sud\nand L2sud come out either of vertices or of black bullets, and they have nonvanishing momen-\ntum. j\nHence the number of lines in L1sud is bounded by k, so that in s4.2d we can bound\nS p\n,PL1sud\nuvn,uDS p\nvPEBsud\nFe\u2212junvuD \u0142 S p\nvPEBsud\nFe\u2212junvu\/2DS p\n,PL1sud\ne\u2212jun,u\/2kuvn,uD\n\u0142 S p\nvPEBsud\nFe\u2212junvu\/2DS2kuvuj D\nk\n, s4.3d\nand in the second line the product can be used to perform the sum over the Fourier labels\u2014this\ngives a factor FkB2\nk\n, with B2=2e\u2212j\/2s1\u2212e\u2212j\/2d\u22121\u2014while the last factor is bounded by A1B1kk!, for\nsome constants A1 and B1.\nWe can bound the value of a tree u by using the bounds s4.2d and s4.3d, and Lemma 4.1. If we\ndefine\n\u00ab1\n\u22121\n= maxhB1, uvu\u22121jmaxhc0,FB2jmaxh1,s2c0d\u22121j , s4.4d\nwith c0=\u02dba, and take into account that the number of unlabeled trees in Tk,n is bounded by 22k\u22121\nsbecause each tree in Tk,n has at most 2k\u22121 nodesd, then\nFIG. 7. Graphical representation of c3=x0\ns3d\n. The second contribution must be counted twice, while the first one must be\ncounted four times. There is no contribution with any white bullet carrying the order label k=1 as c1=0.\nFIG. 8. Example of tree appearing in the graphical expansions s3.5d and s3.6d. The number of lines entering any vertex v\ncan be only either sv=1 or sv=2, while no line enters the endpoints. The order of the tree is given by the number of\nelements in Vsud \\V0sud plus the number of elements in EBsud plus the sum of the order labels of the white bullets. Then,\nif k1, k2, and k3 are the order labels of the white bullets in the figure, the order of the tree is k=k1+k2+k3+10 if v0\nPV0sud and k=k1+k2+k3+9 if v0\u201eV0sud. In the latter case one must have k1.0 because of the constraint in the sum\nappearing in s3.6d.\n062704-9 Summation of divergent series J. Math.

Note that in that case the bound B2,\narising from the sum over the Fourier labels, can be replaced with a factor 2N, and B1 can be\nreplaced with uvuN.\nThen we have proved the following result.\nProposition 4.2: Given the equation (2.1) with f as in (1.4), there is only one periodic solution\nin the form of a formal power series, and the corresponding period is the same period 2p \/v as the\nforcing term. The coefficients of such a formal power series satisfy the bounds (4.5).\nOne could ask if the factorials arising in the bounds are only a technical problem, or whether\nthey are a sign that the series really diverges. To order k one can easily provide examples of trees\nwhich grow like factorials; see for instance the tree represented in Fig. 9, where there are k\u22121\nvertices with only one entering line. Then the corresponding value is\nValsud = sivnd2sk\u22121d\n1\nsivndk\nfn = sivndk\u22122fn, s4.6d\nwhich behaves as k! for large k. Furthermore it is unlikely that there are cancellations with the\nvalues of other trees because the value of any other tree uPTk,n can be proportional at most to\nsivndp, with p,k\u22122 sstrictlyd. Hence we expect that the coefficients un\nskd\n, even if well defined to\nall orders, grow like factorials, so preventing the convergence of the series.\nThe lack of analyticity is further supported by the following fact. If we consider s2.1d without\nthe quadratic term and with a=0, that is\n\u00abx\u00a8 + x\u02d9 = fsvtd, f0 = 0, s4.7d\nin Fourier space, we find x0=0 and ivns1+ i\u00abvndxn= fn for n\u00de0. Hence the equation is trivially\nsolvable, and it gives\nxstd = o\nn\u00de0\nfn\nivns1 + i\u00abvnd\neivnt. s4.8d\nOf course the solution xstd of the linear equation is not analytic in \u00ab sin a neighborhood of the\norigind when f is an analytic function containing all the harmonics, as each point \u00ab= i \/vn repre-\nsents a singularity point for xstd, and such points accumulate to the origin as n\u2192\u2018. Then it is\nlikely that also when the quadratic terms are taken into account the solution cannot be analytic.\nTherefore giving a meaning to the perturbation series requires some more work, and we discuss\nthis next.\nAn important remark is that for any k\u00f81 there is no tree whose value can be bounded worse\nthan proportionally to a factorial, as the estimates s4.5d show, indeed they have been obtained by\nbounding separately the value of each single tree. This observation will play an important role in\nthe forthcoming analysis.\nFIG. 9. Example of tree whose value grows as a factorial. If k is the order of the tree shence there are k\u22121 vertices and 1\nblack bulletd, then the value of the tree is given in s4.6d.\n062704-10 Gentile et al. J. Math.

PERIODIC FORCING TERMS\nTo deal completely with the case of analytic functions and prove existence of the periodic\nsolution, we must modify the graphical expansion envisaged in the preceding sections.\nLet us come back to the equation s2.1d, and write it in Fourier space. For n\u00de0 and denoting\nwith xn the nth Fourier coefficient, we obtain\n\u00absivnd2xn + ivn xn + \u00ab o\nn1+n2=n\nxn1\nxn2\n= \u00abfn, s5.1d\nprovided that for n=0 we have\no\nn1+n2=0\nxn1\nxn2\n= 0. s5.2d\nLet us rewrite s5.1d as\n\u00absivnd2xn + ivn xn + m\u00ab o\nn1+n2=n\nxn1\nxn2\n= m\u00abfn, s5.3d\nand look for a solution xstd which is analytic in m, which suggests us to write\nxstd = o\nk=0\n\u2018\nmkxfkgstd . s5.4d\nOf course we want the value m=1 to be inside the analyticity domain. Note also that now xfkg, the\ncoefficient to order k, has a different meaning with respect to the previous expansion s1.4d in\npowers of \u00ab, and for this reason with use a different symbol to denote it. We shall call the series\ns5.4d the resummed series, because the coefficients xfkgstd depend on \u00ab, and are given by the sum\nof infinitely many terms of the formal series s2.5d.\nAgain for k=0 we must take xn\nf0g\n=0 for n\u00de0 and fix c0;x0\nf0g\n=\u02dba, with a; f0.\nTo order k\u00f81 sin md we obtain for n\u00de0,\nivns1 + i\u00abvndxn\nfkg\n= \u00abfndk,1 \u2212 \u00ab o\nk1+k2=k\u22121\no\nn1+n2=n\nxn1\nfk1gxn2\nfk2g\n, s5.5d\nwhile for n=0 we require\no\nk1+k2=k\no\nn1+n2=n\nxn1\nfk1gxn2\nfk2g = 0. s5.6d\nBy setting ck=x0\nfkg the latter equation can be written as fcf. s2.10dg\nc1 = 0, ck = \u2212\n1\n2c0\no\nk8=1\nk\u22121\no\nnPZ\nxn\nfk\u2212k8gx\n\u2212n\nfk8g\n, k \u00f8 2. s5.7d\nThen we can proceed as in Sec. III, with some slight changes that we now explain. First of all\nnote that s5.5d gives for n\u00de0,\nxn\nf0g\n= 0,\nxn\nf1g\n=\n\u00abfn\nivns1 + i\u00abvnd\n,\n062704-11 Summation of divergent series J. Math.

With the previous notations this means that L1sud\n=x and V1sud=x, hence Vsud=V2sud. Moreover also the propagators and the node factors of the\nvertices are different, as s3.1d and s3.2d must be replaced with\ng, = H1\/ssivn,ds1 + i\u00abvn,dd , n, \u00de 0,1, n, = 0, J s5.9d\nand, respectively,\nFv = H\u2212 \u00ab , v \u201e V0sud ,\n\u2212 1\/2c0, v P V0sud ,\nJ s5.10d\nand we recall once more that only vertices v with sv=2 are allowed. Finally, the node factors\nassociated with the endpoints are Fv=ckv if v is a white bullet and Fv=\u00abfnv if v is a black bullet.\nAs in Sec. III we can envisage an expansion in which all white bullets v have kv=0 ssimply\nby expanding iteratively in trees the white bullets of higher orderd. A tree appearing in this new\nexpansion is represented in Fig. 12.\nWith the notations s4.1d, we obtain the bounds\nU p\nvPVsud\\V0sud\nFvU \u0142 u\u00abuuVsudu, U p\n,PLsud\ng,U \u0142 p\n,PL2sud\n1\nuvn,uu1 + i\u00abvn,u\n,\nU p\nvPV0sud\nFvU \u0142 S 12c0D\nuV0sudu\n, U p\nvPEWsud\nFvU \u0142 c0uEWsudu, s5.11d\nFIG. 10.

The function xstd can be represented as the abso-\nlutely convergent integral\nxstd =\n1\n\u00ab\nE\n0\n\u2018\ne\u2212s\/\u00abBst;sdds s5.18d\nfor all \u00abPCR, and this property can be stated by saying that xstd is Borel summable sin \u00abd and\nBst ;\u00abd is its Borel transform.9 This implies that the function given by the summation procedure\ndescribed in Theorem 1 is unique. Therefore we have obtained the following result, which\nstrengthens Theorem 1.\nTheorem 5.4: The solution given by Theorem 1 is Borel summable at the origin.\nNote that Watson\u2019s theorem cannot be invoked to obtain this result because the singularities\nare along the imaginary axis.\nIn particular if fsvtd=a+b sin t then there is a periodic solution xstd=a+\u00abb cos t+Os\u00ab2d,\nwith a=\u02dba, which has period 2p and moves around the fixed point sx , x\u02d9d= sa ,0d, and close to it\nwithin Os\u00abd. No other periodic solution analytic in \u00ab can exist.\nWe conclude this section with two remarks. The summation criterion envisaged in this section\nis reminiscent of that used sin a more difficult situationd in Ref. 6 for hyperbolic lower-\ndimensional tori. However in that case we are not able to prove Borel summability because to\norder k the bounds were like sk ! da for some a.1. Neither extension to Watson\u2019s theorem9\n062704-14 Gentile et al. J.

We shall find a very similar situation in next section.\nThe lack of analyticity in \u00ab in a neighborhood of the origin is due to the accumulation of\nsingularity points along the imaginary axis in the complex \u00ab-plane swhere the quantity 1+ i\u00abvn\nvanishes for nPZd. The analyticity domain is tangential to the imaginary axis, and this allows us\nto apply Nevanlinna\u2019s theorem. We find that this situation has some analogies with a different\nproblem, the analyticity properties of rescaled versions of some dynamical systems, such as\nSiegel\u2019s problem4 sand its linearization as considered in Ref. 10d, the standard map2 and general-\nized standard maps,3 for complex rotation numbers tending to rational values in the complex\nplane. In those cases, however, only nontangential limits could be considered. Of course the\nsituation is slightly more complicated there, because the set of accumulating singularity points is\ndense\u2014and not only numerable as in the present case.\nVI. QUASIPERIODIC FORCING TERMS\nIn the case of analytic quasiperiodic forcing terms, we shall assume a Diophantine condition\non the rotation vector v, that is\nuv \u00b7 nu \u00f8 C0unu\u2212t \" n P Zd \\ h0j , s6.1d\nwhere unu= unu1;un1u+ fl + undu, and C0 and t are positive constants. We need t\u00f8d\u22121 in order to\nhave a nonvoid set of vectors satisfying the condition s6.1d, and t.d\u22121 in order to have a full\nmeasure set of such vectors. For simplicity sand without loss of generalityd we can assume C0\n,g \/2, with g=minh1, ucuj, where c is a suitable constant to be fixed as c=\u22122c0, with c0=\u02dba.\nThe equation of motion can be written in Fourier space as\niv \u00b7 ns1 + i\u00abv \u00b7 ndxn + \u00ab o\nn1+n2=n\nxn1\nxn2\n= \u00abfn, s6.2d\nand the formal expansion for a quasiperiodic solution with frequency vector v reads as\nxstd = o\nk=0\n\u2018\n\u00abkxskdstd = o\nk=0\n\u2018\n\u00abk o\nnPZd\nein\u00b7vtxn\nskd\n, s6.3d\nand to see that the coefficients xn\nskd\nare well defined to all orders k\u00f80 one can proceed as in Sec.\nII, with no extra difficulty. In particular the Diophantine condition s6.1d is sufficient to assure\nanalyticity in t of the coefficients xskdstd.\nAlso the graphical representation can be worked out as in Sec. III. The only difference is that\nnow the propagators of the lines with nonvanishing momentum n,, which is defined according to\ns3.2d, with the vectors replacing the scalars, are given by 1\/ siv \u00b7n,d, the node factors associated\nwith the vertices v with sv=1 are given by Fv=\u2212siv \u00b7n,vd\n2\n, and the node factors associated with\nthe black bullets v are given by Fv= fnv, with nvPZd \\ h0j. All the other notations remain un-\nchanged.\nThis yields that the propagators and the node factors can be bounded as in s4.2d and s4.3d, with\njust a few differences of notation. More precisely one has\nU p\nvPV1sud\nFvUU p\n,PL1sud\ng,U \u0142 p\n,PL1sud\nuvuun,u, U p\n,PL1sud\ng,U \u0142 p\n,PL1sud\n1\nuv \u00b7 n,u\n\u0142 C0\n\u22121un,ut,\nU p\nvPV0sud\nFvU \u0142 S 12c0D\nuV0sudu\n, U p\nvPEWsud\nFvU \u0142 c0uEWsudu, s6.4d\n062704-15 Summation of divergent series J.

Indeed it is the source of a small divisors problem, which\ncannot be set only through the Diophantine condition s6.1d.\nTo each order k we obtain for xskdstd a bound like ABkk!maxh1,tj, where the factor 1 arises from\nthe propagators of the lines in L1sud and the factor t from those of the lines in L2sud in s6.3d. The\nlast assertion is easily proved by reasoning as in s4.3d, with maxhuvuun,u ,C0\n\u22121un,utj\n\u0142maxhC0\n\u22121\n, uvujun,umaxh1,tj replacing n,. In particular only for d=2 and t=1 we obtain the same\nbound proportional to k! as in the case of periodic solution sof course with different constants A\nand Bd. Note that the vectors satisfying the Diophantine condition s6.1d with t=1 for d=2 is of\nzero measure but everywhere dense. An example of vector of this kind is v= s1,g0d, where g0\n= s\u02db5\u22121d \/2 is the golden section.\nHowever, to deal with the problem of accumulation of small divisors and discuss the issue of\nconvergence of the series, we need renormalization group techniques. The first step is just to\nintroduce a multiscale decomposition of the propagators, and this leads naturally to the introduc-\ntion of clusters and self-energy graphs into the trees. The discussion can be performed either as in\nRef. 6 or as in Ref. 8 sand in Ref. 7d. We choose to follow Ref. 8, which is more similar to the\npresent problem because the propagators are scalar quantities and not matrices. In any case, with\nrespect to the quoted reference, we shall use a multiscale decomposition involving only the\nquantities uv \u00b7n,u, that is without introducing any dependence on \u00ab in the compact support func-\ntions. Indeed this is more suitable to investigate the analyticity properties in \u00ab, and, as we shall\nsee, we shall not need to exclude any real value of \u00ab in order to give a meaning to the resummed\nseries, a situation more reminiscent of Ref. 6 than of Ref. 8.\nIn the following we confine ourselves to outlining the main differences with respect to Ref. 8.\nLet us introduce the functions cn and xn, for n\u00f80, as in Ref. 8, Sec. 5. In particular cnsuxud\u00de0\nimplies uxu\u00f82\u2212sn+1dC0 and xnsuxud\u00de0 implies uxu\u01422\u2212nC0.

For n=0 the bound is trivially satisfied by\nLemma 6.2. Assuming that the bounds hold for all n8,n then we can apply Lemma 6.1 and\ndeduce the bounds s6.13d. In turn this implies that the renormalized propagators on scale n can be\nwritten as gfngsx ;\u00abd=1\/Fsxd, with Fsxd written as in s6.14d for c=\u22122c0 fcf. s6.8dg, and for suitable\nfunctions c1s\u00abd and c2s\u00ab ,xd, depending on n and satisfying the properties listed after s6.14d for\nsome n-independent constant c8.

This follows from\nLemma 6.4 with l=1, but it is obvious independently of that result because one has c1s\u00abd=c\u00ab\n+Os\u00ab2d, with c=\u22122c0PR.

One can easily realize that the region CR is\ncontained inside the domain DR scf. Fig. 16d. Fix l=tan w, with wP f0,p \/4g ssee Fig. 15d, for all\nsuch w the line which forms an angle w with the imaginary axis ssee Fig. 15d and passes through\nthe origin intersects the boundary of DR at a distance R tan w from the origin and the boundary of\nCR at a distance R sin w. Hence we have an analyticity domain of the same form as in the case of\nperiodic forcing terms. Nevertheless the results found so far do not allow us to obtain Borel\nsummability, notwithstanding a circular analyticity domain CR is found, as the bounds which are\nsatisfied inside the region CR are not uniform in \u00ab sbecause of the dependence on ld.\nNote that b=1 in s6.11d is the same exponent appearing in the bounds of the propagators in\nthe formal expansion. To obtain uniform bounds in a domain CR, for some value of R, we must\nallow larger values of b. The following result is obtained.\nLemma 6.5: Set x=v \u00b7n and assume uxu,C0. If R is small enough one has uFsxdu.guxu2 \/2 for\nall \u00abPCR.\nProof: Set F1sxd=F0sxd+c\u00ab and \u00ab=a+ ib. If ux+bsc\u2212x2du\u0142 uxu \/2 one has ubsc\u2212x2du\u00f8 uxu \/2 and\n3uxu\u00f8 ubcu\u00f8 uxu \/4.

On the other hand, one has u\u00abu2=a2+b2\u0142a2\n+9x2 \/c2, so that uFsxdu\u00f8 uF1sxdu\u22122c8u\u00abu2\u00f8 uF1sxdu \/2\u00f8gx2 \/2. The case ux+bsc\u2212x2du\u00f8 uxu \/2 can be\ndiscussed as in Lemma 6.3, and it gives uFsxdu\u00f8guxu \/4. j\nThen we can prove the following result by proceeding exactly as in the proof of Lemma 8.\nLemma 6.6: If R is small enough for all n\u00f80 and all \u00abPCR the renormalized propagators\ngfngsx ;\u00abd satisfy the bounds (6.11) with b=2 and C1 a suitable constant.\nThe advantage of Lemma 6.4 with respect to Lemma 6.6 is that the bound of R is better, which\nmeans that the domain CR contained inside DR in the first case is larger than the domain CR of the\nsecond case. The advantage of Lemma 6.6 is that it allows uniform bounds inside the correspond-\ning domain CR to be obtained. Nevertheless, because of the factor b=2, a bound ABkk!2t is\nobtained for the coefficients xskdstd of the formal solution, and a result analogous to Proposition 2\ncan be proved also for the present case, with N!2t replacing N!; we do not give the details as the\nproof is identical. Hence the bounds that we have are not good enough to obtain Borel summa-\nbility in the case of quasiperiodic forcing terms, a situation strongly reminiscent of that encoun-\ntered in Ref. 6. In fact at best one can set t=1 for d=2 swhich, as noted above, corresponds to a\nset of Diophantine vectors of zero measure but everywhere densed, but this in turn implies a bound\nproportional to N!2, which is not enough to apply Nevanlinna\u2019s theorem.\nThe conclusion is that the resummed series\nxstd = o\nk=0\n\u2018\nmkxfkgstd , s6.15d\nwhere the coefficients xfkgstd are given by\nFIG. 16.

In general it is not obvious\u2014even if\nexpected\u2014that s6.15d solves the equation of motion s1.1d. Indeed, unlike the case of periodic\nforcing terms, we have no result, such as Nevanlinna\u2019s theorem on Borel summability, which we\ncan rely upon in order to link the resummed series to the formal series. Therefore we must check\nby hand that by expanding in powers of \u00ab the resummed series we recover the formal power series\ns6.3d. This means that the resummed series, which in principle could be unrelated to the equation\nof motion sbecause of the way it has been definedd, in fact solves such an equation. Such a\nproperty can be proved by reasoning as in Ref. 8, Sec. 8. Again we omit the details, which can be\neasily worked out.\nWe can summarize our results in the following statement.\nTheorem 6.7: Given the equation (1.1) with f analytic in its argument and v satisfying the\nDiophantine condition (6.1), there exists \u00ab0 such that for all real \u00ab with u\u00abu,\u00ab0 there is a quasi-\nperiodic solution with the same frequency vector as the forcing term. Such a solution extends to a\nfunction analytic in the domain DR shown in Fig. 16, with R=\u00ab0.\nThe conclusion is that the summation criterion described here gives a well defined function,\nwhich is quasiperiodic and solves the equation of motion s1.1d, but the criterion is not equivalent\nto Borel summability any more. In particular the issue of whether such quasiperiodic solutions are\nunique or not remains open, as in Ref. 6.\nVII. EXTENSION TO MORE GENERAL NONLINEARITIES\nWhen considering the equation s1.5d the formal analysis of Sec. II sand of Sec. VI in the case\nof quasiperiodic forcing termsd can be performed essentially in the same way. If we write\ngsxd = o\np=0\n\u2018 1\np!\ngpsx \u2212 c0dp, gp =\ndpg\ndxp\nsc0d ,\ns7.1d\nfgsxdgn\nskd\n= o\np=0\n\u2018 1\np!\ngp o\nk1+fl+kp=k\nn1+fl+np=n\nxn1\nsk1d fl xnpskpd, k \u00f8 0,\nthen the recursive equations for n\u00de0 are\nxn\ns0d\n= 0,\nxn\ns1d\n=\nfn\niv \u00b7 n\n, s7.2d\nxn\nskd\n= \u2212 siv \u00b7 ndxn\nsk\u22121d\n\u2212\n1\niv \u00b7 n\nfgsxdgn\nsk\u22121d\n, k \u00f8 2,\nwhile the compatibility condition becomes fgsxdg0\nskd\n= f0dk,0 for k\u00f80. The latter for k=0 gives\ngsc0d= f0, while for k\u00f81 gives g8sc0dck+Rsc0 ,c1 ,\u2026 ,ck\u22121d=0, where the function\nRsc0 ,c1 ,\u2026 ,ck\u22121d depends on the coefficients to all orders k8,k, hence, in particular, on the\nconstants c0 ,\u2026 ,ck\u22121. Therefore the constants ck can be fixed iteratively as\n062704-20 Gentile et al. J. Math. Phys. 46, 062704 ~2005!\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Note that the first condition in s1.6d requires f0PRansgd, and if such\na condition is satisfied then the condition on the derivative is a genericity condition. Note also that\nthe class of functions gsxd which are not allowed depends on f smore precisely on its average f0d.\nFor instance an explicit example of a function which does not satisfy s1.6d is gsxd=3x2\u22122x3 if\nf0=1.\nThe graphical representation differs from that of the preceding sections as now the number of\nlines entering a vertex v can assume any value svPN, and if v\u201eV0sud the corresponding node\nfactor is\nFv = \u2212\n\u00ab\nsv!\ngsv, s7.4d\nwhich is bounded proportionally to some constant G to the power sv. Since ovPVsudssv\u22121d\n= uEsudu\u22121\u0142k\u22121 sby Lemma 4.1d this produces an overall constant G2k in the tree value. Also the\nstudy of the convergence of both the formal series and the resummed series can then be performed\nas in the previous case, and no further difficulty arises. The constant c appearing after s6.14d\nbecomes \u2212g8sc0d, instead of \u22122c0, so that still one has c\u00de0 by the assumption s1.6d.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are indebted to Ugo Bessi for many enlightening discussions.\n1 Bartuccelli, M.
