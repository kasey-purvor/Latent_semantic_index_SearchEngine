Res., 115, B07407,\ndoi:10.1029\/2009JB006615.\n1. Introduction\n[2] To determine long\u2010term vertical deformation, the use\nof absolute gravimeters is most appropriate, as no instru-\nmental drift needs to be corrected. As with other geodetic\nquantities, gravity integrates many phenomena, and it remains\na challenge to isolate the contribution from any particular\nsource. Any change in the measured gravity can be caused by\neither mass change around the instrument, vertical displace-\nment of the instrument itself, or both. In many areas, the\nhydrological signal dominates the measured gravimetric\nsignal, after correcting for tidal, atmospheric, and polar\nmotion effects [e.g., Van Camp et al., 2006; Longuevergne et\nal., 2009]. These hydrological effects can be more important\nthan any tectonic effects and may introduce large time\u2010\ncorrelated noise into the data, which may be described as a\nstochastic process.\n[3] Accounting for the right type of noise is important not\nonly when estimating gravity variations and their uncertainties\nbut alsowhen attempting tomitigate this noise. This study aims\nat examining the power spectrum of the gravity signal of\nhydrologic origin to determine how, and with what precision,\nwe can separate the hydrology from tectonic motion in abso-\nlute gravimeter time series.\n[4] Classically [Mandelbrot, 1983; Agnew, 1992], many\ngeophysical signals can be described in terms of a power\nlaw in the frequency domain of the form\nPx\u00f0f \u00de \u00bc 2\u00012rw\n2\u0003f\u00f0 \u00de\u0004\nf \u0004\u00fe1s\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere f is the spatial or temporal frequency, srw is the\nscaling for the random walk part of the model, fs is the sam-\npling frequency, and \u0004 is the spectral index [Mandelbrot and\nVan Ness, 1968]. The interpretation of the \u0004 value in terms of\nnoise type is given in Table 1.\n[5] However, not all geophysical signals follow a power\nlaw over all frequency ranges. Of particular interest to us is\nthe first\u2010order Gauss Markov (FOGM) process, with a ran-\ndom walk spectrum (\u0004 = \u22122) at high frequencies and a flat-\n1Department of Seismology, Observatoire Royal de Belgique, Brussels,\nBelgium.\n2Institut G\u00e9ographique National, LAREG, Champs\u2010sur\u2010Marne, France.\n3Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Paris, France.\n4Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot Paris, Paris, France.\n5Institut f\u00fcr Meteorologie und Geophysik, Universit\u00e4t Wien, Wien,\nAustria.\n6Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, United Kingdom.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JB006615\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, B07407, doi:10.1029\/2009JB006615, 2010\nB07407 1 of 10\ntening at low frequency; it is characterized by a power\nspectrum of the form\nPx\u00f0f \u00de \u00bc 2\u00012rw\nfs\n\u00052 \u00fe 4\u00032f 2 ; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere b controls the crossover frequency (the frequency at\nwhich the spectrum flattens) and srw is the scaling for the\nrandom walk part of the model. This concept can be gener-\nalized to the Generalized Gauss Markov model (GGM),\nwhere the high\u2010frequency power law can take any spectral\nindex, \u0004, as opposed to just randomwalk. The power law then\nbecomes\nPx\u00f0f \u00de \u00bc 2\u00012rw\n\u00052 \u00fe 4\u00032f 2\u00f0 \u00de\u0004=2\nf \u0004\u00fe1s\n: \u00f03\u00de\n[6] It seems physically reasonable that the hydrological\nsignal may obey some form of Gauss\u2010Markov model, with\nthe spectrum flattening at periods longer than a few years or\nmore. For example, random walk behavior, because it is\nnonstationary, would theoretically allow the possibility that\nwater may disappear globally over long periods of time\nor that unlimited amounts of water could be stored in the\nground. Therefore, the separation of the hydrological and\ntectonic signals in the gravity can be achieved only by either\none of the following methods: (1) The hydrological signal is\nknown with a sufficient accuracy and can be corrected with\nprecision better than the amplitude of the tectonic signal,\nor (2) it is assumed that the tectonic motion has a long\u2010term\ntrend, but not the hydrological signal. In other words, one\ncan accumulate time series long enough to reach the low\u2010\nfrequency part of the spectrum, where the frequency content\nof the hydrological signal would flatten out. This is inves-\ntigated in this paper.\n[7] Van Camp et al. [2005] studied the power spectra of\nseveral gravimetric series, recorded using absolute and super-\nconducting gravimeters (SGs) at the ProudmanOceanographic\nLaboratory (Bidston, UK) and at theMembach station (eastern\nBelgium). They estimated, for a set of power noise models,\nthe time necessary for a tectonic slope of 1 nm\/s2\/a (equiva-\nlent to a vertical displacement of 0.5 mm\/a) to be separated\nfrom the climate signal. They showed that the data best fit a\nFractional Brownian noisemodel, but physical considerations\nindicated that FOGM is more likely. Observed flattening of\nthe power spectral densities (PSDs) at low frequency was\nobserved, but such flattening has remained questionable. In\nthis paper, based on actual time series from superconducting\ngravimeters and a hydrological model, we confirm that the\nobserved flattening is a real effect.\n[8] Numerous authors have studied the impact of envi-\nronmental factors on the local gravity variations [e.g., Van\nCamp et al., 2006; Hokkanen et al., 2007; Naujoks et al.,\n2008; Longuevergne et al., 2009; Lampitelli and Francis,\n2010; Creutzfeld et al., 2010]. They showed, by studying\nthe relationship between local gravity and water storage, that\nthe hydrological effect dominates, after correcting the time\nseries from well\u2010known effects such as tides, polar motion,\nand atmospheric forcing. They also showed the importance\nof very local geologic and hydrologic conditions, e.g., the\nsoil moisture, rock porosity, vegetation, and water tables.\nBased on in situ hydrogeological investigations, they built a\nmodel to account for the local hydrology effects in gravity\ntime series. To generalize this type of study, one can use\nglobal hydrology models, which provide hydrology mass\ndistribution as a function of time. However, these models\nare not sufficiently accurate to fully allow precise correction\nof gravity time series [Boy and Hinderer, 2006; Neumeyer et\nal., 2006]. On the other hand, only a few gravity stations are\ninstrumented with adequately maintained soil moisture probes\nand piezometers. Therefore, the separation of hydrology and\ntectonic processes can be achieved only by accumulating data\nseries that are long enough.\n[9] This paper aims at determining the time required for\nthe environmental signal to average out to a level sufficient\nfor tectonic studies. At present, there is not enough available\nrepeated absolute gravity time series to investigate the long\u2010\nterm behavior of gravity. On the other hand, SGs are con-\ntinuously monitoring the gravity changes and time series are\navailable through the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP\n[Crossley et al., 1999]) database. Apart from a linear or an\nexponential drift [Van Camp and Francis, 2006], the SGs\nprovide the same information. Consequently, we used them to\ninvestigate the spectral signature of gravity measurements.\n[10] In section 2, we present the data used and how they\nwere preprocessed for our study. In section 3, the hydro-\nlogical effects down to the decadal time scale are investi-\ngated using the predictions of the Land Dynamics (LaD)\nworld\u2010Gascoyne land water\u2010energy balances model and\ncomparing the spectral behavior of the SG time series and\nthe LaD predictions. Finally, with a better understanding of\nthe environmental noise affecting land\u2010based gravity mea-\nsurements, section 4 investigates the ability of land\u2010based\nabsolute gravity measurements to monitor slow gravity rates\nof change in different climatic regimes.\n2. Data Used and Their Preprocessing\n2.1. Gravity data\n[11] In this study, we used 18 time series from the GGP\ndatabase (see Table 2) [Crossley et al., 1999]. The time series\nhave been corrected for tidal effects using tidal gravimetric\nfactors obtained through the ETERNA package [Wenzel,\n1996]; the atmospheric influence has been removed by\napplying a linear admittance of \u22123.3 mGal\/hPa [Merriam,\n1992]. The centrifugal effect associated with polar motion\nhas also been corrected [Wahr, 1985]. Since our focus is on\nenvironmental effects, we also subtracted a degree 3 poly-\nnomial fit, accounting for any nonlinear instrumental drift and\ninternal geophysical signal. A more sophisticated method,\nsuch as the one proposed by Van Camp and Francis [2006] to\nanalyze the instrumental causes of the drift, requires numer-\nous repeated absolute gravity measurements and is unneces-\nsary in the scope of our study, as this does not modify the\nshape of the PSDs.\nTable 1. \u0004 Value in Term of Noise Type\n\u0004 Value Noise Type\n[\u22123,\u22121] Fractional Brownian motion\n\u22122 Random walk\n\u22121 Flicker (or pink) noise\n0 White noise\nVAN CAMP ET AL.: HYDROLOGY, GRAVITY, AND TECTONICS B07407B07407\n2 of 10\n2.2. The LaD Model\n[12] The LaD model [Milly and Shmakin, 2002; Shmakin\net al., 2003] provides us with water storage data separated\ninto subsurface water mass, surface (reservoir) water mass,\nand snowmass. Data are distributed as monthly 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grids,\nforced by estimated historical atmospheric conditions. The\noutputs of the LaD model were converted into gravity time\nvariations by computing the sum of the gravity change\nresulting from the elastic deformation of the Earth due to the\nwater mass load and the direct mass attraction [Farrell, 1972].\nAccording to previous studies [Boy and Hinderer, 2006;\nNeumeyer et al., 2006], other global hydrologymodels (Global\nLand Data Assimilation System [Rodell et al., 2004] and the\nLeaky\u2010Bucket Model H96 [Fan and van den Dool, 2004]) are\nno more successful in correcting gravity time series.\n3. Times Series and Power Spectral Densities\n3.1. Time Series\n[13] Figure 1 shows the gravity time series at 18 GGP\nstations for the measured gravity (in black) and the LaD\u2010\npredicted hydrologic effect, assuming that all the water and\nsnow mass is situated below the instrument (in red). At\nsome stations, however, particular configurations are such\nthat part of the water mass should be considered above the\ninstrument (see Table 3). The corresponding curves for such\nconfigurations are displayed in blue.\n[14] As shown previously by Boy and Hinderer [2006]\nand Neumeyer et al. [2006], the observations differ strongly\nfrom the changes predicted using global hydrology models.\nConsequently (Table 4), correcting the measurements does\nnot help and can even increase the variances of the time series.\nSome annual signals have the right amplitude, but they most\noften differ in phase. This poor agreement is due to the limited\nspatial coherence of the local scale hydrological noise. As\nshown, for example, by Creutzfeld et al. [2010],Hokkanen et\nal. [2007], Krause et al. [2009], Longuevergne et al. [2009],\nNaujoks et al. [2008], or Van Camp et al. [2006], most of\nthe hydrological effects are induced by the water masses\npresent in a radius <1 km around the gravimeter. Therefore, it\nis currently unfeasible to extract the tectonic signal by cor-\nrecting the SG series using global hydrology models.\n3.2. Power Spectral Densities\n[15] Instead of working in the temporal domain, another\noption consists of investigating the power law of the hydro-\nlogical signal, and in particular if it does flatten at low fre-\nquency such that it averages out in the time series. This\nrequires computing the power spectrum densities of the sig-\nnals, which are displayed in Figures 2a and 2b. As the LaD\nsimulation runs from 1980, we display both the PSD com-\nputed from the whole time series (red) and from the period\noverlapping with the SG observations (green).\n[16] The generally higher level and slope of the PSDs of\nthe SGs at low frequency is probably due to local hydro-\nlogical effects and, to a lesser extent and depending on the\nstation, to instrumental artifacts. Let us discuss different\ncases.\n3.2.1. The PSD of the SGs Higher Than the LaD Model\n(Same Epoch)\n[17] 1. For Membach, one has access to collocated\nrepeated absolute measurements, which are quite useful to\ncontrol the correction of severe jumps, which have affected\nthe SG data. Those jumps are mainly due to power outages\nand helium fillings, and if improperly corrected, they may\nincrease the PSD level. However, the SG at Membach pre-\nsents a slope close to \u22122 in spite of the accurate control made\nusing the absolute gravimeter. On the other hand, it is known\nthat the gravity signal can decrease by a few dozen nm\/s2\nwithin a fewminutes during rainfall [Francis et al., 2004;Van\nCamp et al., 2006; Meurers et al., 2007]. These steplike\nhydrological signals contribute to increase the slope of the\nPSD, as the spectral index of the PSD of a Heaviside function\nis \u22122 [Williams, 2003a].\n[18] It is also worth noting that after applying the local\nhydrological model of Van Camp et al. [2006], the PSD is\nlower at low frequency as shown in Figure 3. This indicates\nthat the hydrological effects play an important role on the\nstructure of the PSD at the Membach station. Hydrological\nmodels are being developed at other stations, but unfortu-\nnately their influences on the PSDs are unpublished.\nTable 2.

At Matsushiro, a similar fast drop has been\nobserved in response to rainfall [Imanishi et al., 2004,\n2006]. This is similar to Membach; those fast changes\ninfluence the whole frequency band and could not be\nmodeled by the LaD model, given the 1\u2010month sampling\nrate and the space resolution. Such behavior, mainly caused\nby soil moisture changes, has also been reported at the\nunderground gravity stations of Walferdange, Luxembourg\n[Lampitelli and Francis, 2010], and Bandung, Indonesia\n[Abe et al., 2006].\n[20] 3. At Cantley, fast rises have been reported, and as\nshown in Figure 1, strong irregular seasonal variations are\nalso observed due to changes in the nearby water table and\nsnow melt [Bower and Courtier, 1998].\n[21] 4. At Tigo, strong annual and interannual signals can\nbe observed on both the SG and LaD time series (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. The superconducting gravimeters (SG) time series (in black) and the gravity data predicted by\nthe Land Dynamics (LaD) world\u2010Gascoyne land water\u2010energy balances model (in red and blue). The red\ncurve is computed assuming all the mass below the instrument, whereas the blue curves account for the\nparticular geometry (see Table 3).\nVAN CAMP ET AL.: HYDROLOGY, GRAVITY, AND TECTONICS B07407B07407\n4 of 10\nHowever, the amplitude is stronger in the SG data due to\nlocal hydrogeological effects. The station is located 2 km\naway from the Biobio river [Wilmes et al., 2005], the\ninfluence of which cannot be predicted by the 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 LaD\nmodel.\n[22] 5. At Mets\u00e4hovi, Strasbourg, and Wettzell, the stud-\nies of Hokkanen et al. [2007], Longuevergne et al. [2009],\nand Creutzfeldt et al. [2010] also confirm the influence of\nlocal hydrology and especially soil moisture on the SG time\nseries. This was also suspected by Sato et al. [2006] at Ny\nAlesund.\n[23] 6. Syowa and Kamioka are the only stations where\nthe PSDs of SG data and LaD model show a significant\ndisagreement. These are not too much of a concern: the SG\ntime series of Kamioka is too short to reach a meaningful\nconclusion, and the Syowa station is located in a polar\nregion, where the LaD model is unreliable (P. C. D. Milly,\npersonal communication).\n[24] 7. As far as we know, no information is available\non the local hydrological effects at the Esashi station.\n3.2.2. The PSD of the SGs Lower Than or Similar\nto the LaD Model (Same Epoch)\n[25] 1. At Medicina station, the gravity signal is highly\ncorrelated with the nearby water table, located a few meters\nunderneath the gravimeter [Zerbini et al., 2001]. These\nvariations and their effects on gravity are smooth and mostly\nseasonal, which explains why Medicina presents one of\nthe flattest PSDs at low frequency and therefore one of\nthe shortest times T1 necessary to measure a slope with an\nuncertainty of 1 nm\/s2\/a (Table 5).\n[26] 2. Vienna station is located on a gentle topographic\nslope, and the surface close to the station is well above the\nSG. However, this does not hold for the distant terrain.\nTherefore, the gravity effect of mass distributed above and\nbelow the station partly compensates [Meurers et al., 2007].\nThe case of Moxa is similar [Naujoks et al., 2008; Krause et\nal., 2009]. This can explain why these stations belong to\nthose with the lowest T1.\n[27] 3. In Bad Homburg, Harnisch et al. [2006] do not\ndiscuss the role of the soil moisture, but they discuss the\ninfluence of the castle housing and waterproofing the SG,\nas well as the presence of a confined aquifer, which should\nnot influence the gravity. This may explain the relatively\nlow level of the PSD of the SG.\n[28] 4. Sutherland has a low rainfall average of\n169 mm\/year, with most of these weak precipitations\noccurring during wintertime. This explains the low level of\nthe PSDs and their low slope.\n[29] 5. For Canberra and Wuhan, the LaD predictions are\nat a much higher level than the SG observations. This may\nbe due to the fact that the SGs are on the bedrock, at the tops\nof mountains (Mount Stromlo, west of Canberra [http:\/\/ilrs.\ngsfc.nasa.gov\/stations\/sitelist\/STL3_sitelog.html]; and Yanjia\nMountain, suburb of Wuhan [Xu et al., 2008]), where the\ndrainage is probably quite efficient.\n[30] Although the slopes present differences, the agree-\nment between the PSD levels of the SG and LaD time series\nindicates that at periods longer than a couple of months, the\ngravity time series are dominated by hydrological effects.\nThe poor agreement in the time domain is due to the limited\nspatial coherence of the local scale hydrological noise.\nHowever, at interannual periods, the coherence should\nincrease and common regional behavior should be found\nin the future.\n4. How Long Is Long Enough?\n[31] With the SG data, we estimate the spectral index \u0004 by\na maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by fitting the\npower law (equation 1) and the stochastic GGM (equation 3)\nmodels to the time series [Williams, 2003b; Langbein, 2004]\nTable 3.

As mentioned\nbefore, the Kamioka time series is much too short to afford\nany conclusions, and the Esashi BICs are actually equal.\nThe Canberra and Sutherland cases may be due paradoxi-\ncally to the low hydrological noise. In other words, its effect\nFigure 2. (continued)\nVAN CAMP ET AL.: HYDROLOGY, GRAVITY, AND TECTONICS B07407B07407\n7 of 10\nis too weak to allow us to observe a significant flattening\n(according to the BIC applied here). It is also worth noting\nthat (1) considering a power law noise, the spectral indexes\nare among the lowest at these two stations and (2) the PSD\nin Canberra is at a lower level for the SG than for the LaD.\nTherefore, even in those four cases, the time T1was computed\nassuming the GGM law.\n[33] This approach could not be applied to the LaD model,\nowing to the insufficient time sampling of monthly data,\nwhich is too sparse and provides meaningless results. How-\never, because of the local hydrological effects discussed in\nthe previous section and possible instrumental artifacts, the\nresults given in Table 5 are probably more conservative and\nrealistic estimates than the LaD would provide.\n[34] For most stations, the time series are not long enough\nto study periods longer than \u223c5 years. To investigate the\nlowest frequencies, we can extrapolate the power law using\nthe LaD data, considering the similarity between the PSDs\nFigure 3.

In all cases (except for the Syowa station),\nthe power spectra of the LaD model flatten, which sub-\nstantiates our results favoring a Gauss Markov structure in\nthe hydrological signal. In the future, slow climate changes\nmay affect the gravity measurements, but this should be\nobserved at the continental scale and a common mode\nshould appear in the different time series, as well as in the\nhydrological models.\n5. Conclusions\n[35] The influence of the hydrological noise on repeated\ngravity measurements has been investigated based on 18\ncontinuous SG time series and on predictions of the LaD\nmodel. Local hydrological effects and possible instrumental\nartifacts limit the flattening of the PSDs of the SG at low\nfrequency, but the PSDs of the SGs and of the LaD pre-\ndictions present similar amplitudes. Applying the BIC to the\nanalysis of the SG time series, the generalized Gauss Markov\nstructure is favored, which confirms the hypothesis of Van\nCamp et al. [2005].\n[36] Given that the SG time series are all shorter than a\ndozen years, and considering the similar spectral behavior of\nthe LaD model (which produced a run length of >35 years);\nthe LaD model was used to confirm the flattening of the\nPSDs of the hydrological effects on gravity at long periods.\n[37] Consequently, we can estimate the length of the data\nset needed to separate a tectonic trend of 1 nm\/s2\/a from\nhydrological signal at the 1s level. It ranges from 3.5 years\nto 17 years, depending on the magnitude of the hydrological\nsignal.\n[38] Acknowledgments. We are grateful to L.
