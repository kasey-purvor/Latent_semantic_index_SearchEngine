Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are often found to be as prevalent as 84 \nTHMs but are currently not regulated in the UK.  However, the European Union is 85 \nconsidering regulating the nine HAAs at 80 \u00b5g L-1 (Cortvriend, 2008) and as such there 86 \nis growing interest in the levels of these compounds found in  UK drinking waters and 87 \nhow best to control them .  In order to comply with these proposed regulations, there 88 \nhas been an increasing interest in using monochloramine as a secondary disinfectant 89 \nbecause of reduced DBP formation and its ability to provide residuals in water 90 \ndistribution systems.  Monochloramine is known to only form trace amounts of THMs 91 \nand HAAs, but the formation of dihalogenated HAAs (DXAAs), although generally 92 \nlower than with chlorine, can still reach significant levels depending on the dose, 93 \nchlorine to ammonia ratio, pH and other conditions (Diehl et al., 2000; Hua and 94 \nReckhow, 2007). The use of monochloramine may also lead to an increase in other 95 \nDBPs such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and iodo- THMs (i-THMs) (Krasner et al., 96 \n1989; Bichsel and Von Gunten, 2000).  HANs and i-THMs are two unregulated classes 97 \nof semi-volatile DBPs also present in disinfected waters alongside other unregulated 98 \nDBPs including halonitromethanes (HNMs), haloaldehydes (HAs) and haloketones 99 \n(HKs) (Krasner et al., 2006).  These semi-volatile DBPs are of interest because of their 100 \ntoxicity. HANs have been reported to be genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic for 101 \nhuman health and HKs exerted carcinogenic or mutagenic effects in mice (Bull and 102 \nRobinson, 1986; Daniel et al., 1986). Plewa et al. (2004) found HNMs to be toxic in 103 \nchinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and Richardson (2003) suggested than i-THMs 104 \ncould be more toxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues. Despite their 105 \npotential health effects, there is no UK or US regulatory limit for these compounds, but 106 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 6\nthe WHO has suggested guideline values of 20 \u00b5g\/L for DCAN, 70 \u00b5g\/L for DBAN and 107 \n10 \u00b5g\/L for TCA (WHO, 2006).  108 \nPast research has established that levels of HAAs and THMs in chlorinated waters vary 109 \naccording to the levels of their precursors.  High NOM concentrations have generally 110 \nbeen associated with high HAA and THM concentrations (Liang and Singer, 2003; 111 \nSharp et al., 2006) and nitrogenous precursors from algae or effluent organic matter 112 \n(EfOM) have been related to nitrogenous DBPs, such as HANs (Oliver et al., 1983).  113 \nThe presence of bromide in water will also affect the concentration of DBPs as will 114 \nother factors such as the disinfectant dose applied, the pH, the temperature of the water 115 \nsamples and the reaction time of disinfectant in water (Singer et al., 2002). To better 116 \ncontrol and understand the formation of DBPs in water samples, the use of formation 117 \npotential (FP) tests have been widely used (Zhang et al., 2000; Liang and Singer, 2003; 118 \nAtes et al., 2007; Krasner et al., 2007). FP tests are usually conducted at bench scale 119 \nwith controlled pH, controlled temperature and relatively high chlorine concentration 120 \ndosed for a long contact time in order to maximise DBPs formation (Krasner et al., 121 \n2007). 122 \nTo have a better understanding of HAAs, THMs and semi-volatile DBPs in treated 123 \nwaters, their formation was evaluated under controlled conditions. Here 11 water 124 \ntreatment works selected from across England and Wales have been surveyed to allow 125 \nus to determine the potential for formation, relative distribution and speciation of DBPs 126 \nas well as identify any relationships between water sources.  The DBPs selected include 127 \nTHM4 (trichloromethane (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), 128 \ndibromochloromethane (DBCM) and tribromomethane (TBM)), HAA9 (MCAA, 129 \nMBAA, DCAA, TCAA, bromochloroacetic acid (BCAA), DBAA, bromodichloroacetic 130 \nacid (BDCAA), dibromochloroacetic acid (DBCAA), and tribromomethane (TBAA)) 131 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 7\nplus four HANs (DCAN, trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN), bromochloroacetonitrile 132 \n(BCAN) and DBAN), two HKs (1,1-dichloropropanone (1,1-DCP) and 1,1,1-133 \ntrichloropropanone (1,1,1-TCP)), two HAs (dichloroacetaldehyde (DCA) and TCA), 134 \ntwo HNMs (trichlornitromethane (TCNM) and dibromonitromethane (DBNM)) and two 135 \ni-THMs (dichloroiodomethane (DCIM) and bromochloroiodomethane (BCIM)).  This is 136 \nthe first study that has reported the potential for formation of HAAs, THMs and a range 137 \nof semi-volatile DBPs in drinking water in England and Wales.  It is also the first 138 \nEuropean study to directly assess what impact the switch from chlorine to 139 \nmonochloramine would have on the concentrations of the DBPs found.    140 \n 141 \n 142 \nMaterials and methods 143 \nWater samples 144 \nTreated water samples were collected in July 2008 from 11 water treatment works, 145 \nspread geographically across England and Wales (Table 1). Samples were collected 146 \nprior to disinfection in polyethylene or glass 1L bottles and shipped to Cranfield 147 \nlaboratory. These were then analysed for pH, non-purgeable organic matter (NPOC) 148 \nusing a TOC 5000 Analyser (Shimadzu, Milton Keynes, UK), ultraviolet (UV) 149 \nabsorbance at 254 nm, and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), which was 150 \ncalculated as the ratio of UV absorbance at 254 nm (m-1) to NPOC (mg C L-1). NPOC 151 \nwas used rather than DOC\/TOC as the level of inorganic carbon in some samples was 152 \ntoo high to enable accurate DOC\/TOC measurement. Bromide and iodine were 153 \nmeasured using inductively coupled plasma\/mass spectrometry (ICP\/MS) (Elan 9000, 154 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 8\nPerkin Elmer, UK). Total bromine and iodine measured were assumed to be primarily 155 \nbromide and iodide. 156 \nSample preparation 157 \nChlorine and monochloramine solutions were prepared following the 4500-Cl B. 158 \nIodometric method I and 4500-Cl F. DPD Ferrous Titrimetric Method respectively 159 \n(APHA, 1992).  For the chlorinated samples, a 100 mL bottle was partly filled with the 160 \nwater sample, the buffer at pH 7.2 and the chlorine solution (chlorine:NPOC ratio was 161 \n3:1 on a weight basis). The bottle was filled completely and capped headspace free with 162 \na PTFE-lined cap. Samples were incubated for 24 hours at 20\u00b0C in the dark. For the 163 \nmonochloraminated samples, a chlorine to nitrogen mass ratio of 3:1 was used in all 164 \nsamples and addition of monochloramine was based on the NPOC level, with combined 165 \nchlorine:NPOC ratio of 3:1 by weight. The procedure of monochloraminated samples 166 \nwas the same as that for chlorinated samples. 167 \nAmmonium chloride at a concentration of 100 mg L-1 was used to quench chlorine and 168 \nmonochloramine residual while not degrading HAAs, in particular HAA3 (BDCAA, 169 \nDBCAA and TBAA) (Singer et al., 2002). Ascorbic acid at a concentration of 35 mg L-1 170 \nwas used to quench chlorine and monochloramine residual in THM and semi-volatile 171 \nDBP samples. The choice is based on the fact that ascorbic acid has been shown not to 172 \ndegrade any of these 16 DBPs (Chinn et al., 2007). 173 \n 174 \nDBP analytical methods 175 \nHAA9 were extracted with a modified version of the US EPA Method 552.2 reported by 176 \nTung et al. (2006). The HAAs were converted to their methyl esters and quantified 177 \nusing gas chromatography coupled with an electron capture detector (GC\/ECD) 178 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 9\n(Agilent 6890).  THM4, four HANs, two HKs, two HAs, two HNMs and two i-THMs 179 \nwere extracted with an adapted method from Krasner et al. (2001). Standards for THM4, 180 \nfor halogenated volatiles as a mixture of DBPs (DCAN, TCAN, BCAN, DBAN, 1,1-181 \nDCP, 1,1,1-TCP and TCNM) and for TCA were available from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd 182 \n(UK). DCA standard was provided by TCI Europe (Belgium); DBNM, DCIM and 183 \nBCIM were obtained from Helix Biotech (Canada). A 30 mL sample was transferred to 184 \na 60 ml glass vial, then adjusted to a pH of 3.5 or less and extracted with 3 mL of MtBE 185 \ncontaining an internal standard. The solvent phase containing the DBPs was separated 186 \nfrom the aqueous phase by addition of 10 g of sodium sulphate and 1 g copper sulphate. 187 \nThen the sample was shaken manually for 3 to 5 minutes. Once settled the top layer was 188 \nfinally transferred to an autosampler vial and analysed with GC\/ECD (Agilent 6890). 189 \nThe instrument conditions were as follows. A volume of 1 \u00b5L was injected splitless 190 \nwith the detector set at 200\u00b0C. Separation was performed by a ZB-1ms column (30 m \u00d7 191 \n0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm) with a helium carrier gas at a column flow rate of 1.0 mL\/min. The 192 \ninitial oven temperature was 35\u00b0C and held for 22 minutes followed by a 10\u00b0C per 193 \nminute temperature ramp to 145\u00b0C and held for 2 minutes and a final ramp of 20\u00b0C per 194 \nminute ramp to 225\u00b0C and held for 10 minutes. The total run time was 49 minutes. The 195 \ndetector temperature was 290\u00b0C and the data were collected with a rate of 20 Hz. 196 \nQuality assurance undertaken showed good reproducibility of the method and limits of 197 \ndetection were typically in the low \u00b5g L-1 range (Table 2). 198 \n 199 \nResults and discussion 200 \nWater characterisation 201 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 10\nSamples of treated waters collected from drinking water treatment works across 202 \nEngland and Wales were analysed for pH, NPOC, UV, bromine and iodine. These 203 \nresults are presented below along with calculated SUVA values (Table 1). The average 204 \nNPOC concentration was 1.6 mg L-1 with the highest value (3.7 mg L-1) found in LR 205 \nand the lowest concentration (0.2 mg L-1) in B1. The NPOC concentration of the 206 \nlowland rivers (mean of 1.7 mg L-1) was similar to that measured in the upland 207 \nreservoirs (mean of 1.5 mg L-1).  SUVA values calculated here ranged from 1.5 m-1 L 208 \nmg-1 C (B1) to 5.4 m-1 L mg-1 C (UR3). L1 and UR3, with low NPOC values (1.2 and 209 \n1.1 mg L-1 respectively), had high SUVA values of 4.6 and 5.4 m-1 L mg-1 C 210 \nrespectively, which indicate that the NOM was hydrophobic in character.  No specific 211 \ntrends were observed between the water treatment processes used and the treated water 212 \nSUVA values. The two waters with the highest SUVA (L1 and UR3) were treated with 213 \ndirect filtration, not coagulation which is more effective towards removal of 214 \nhydrophobic material (Sharp et al., 2006). 215 \nThe level of bromine, which we have assumed here to be mainly bromide, ranged from 216 \n14 to 310 \u00b5g L-1 (Table 1), with an average concentration of 105 \u00b5g L-1. This is in 217 \nagreement with the concentrations of bromide in natural waters reported by Amy et al. 218 \n(1994) ranging from 30 to 200 \u00b5g L-1, with an average of 100 \u00b5g L-1. The highest 219 \nconcentrations were found in B1, LR, BR2 and BR3 and it is expected here that these 220 \nwaters with levels of bromide > 100 \u00b5g L-1 would form primarily brominated DBPs 221 \n(Singer et al., 2002). 222 \nThe level of iodine found during this survey varied between 0.9 and 16.7 \u00b5g L-1 (Table 223 \n1) and is in line with the findings of Fuge et al. (1986) who reported total iodine in 224 \nwater sources ranging between 0.5 and 20 \u00b5g L-1. Interestingly the ratio of bromine to 225 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 11\niodine here varied considerably between 1 and 22%, which indicates no specific trend 226 \nbetween the level of bromine and iodine in the water sources.  227 \n 228 \nDBP levels from different water sources 229 \nHAAs 230 \nThe concentrations of nine HAAs from the 11 treated waters were quantified after 231 \nexposure to chlorine and monochloramine (Figure 1). In Figure 1, chlorine data are 232 \nrepresented as the treatment work reference only (e.g. B1) and the monochloramine data 233 \nare shown as NH2Cl-work reference (e.g. NH2Cl-B1). It is clear that using 234 \nmonochloramine produced significantly less HAAs (average reduction of 77%) when 235 \ncompared to chlorine. These findings compare well with previous studies that have 236 \nlooked at HAA formation when using preformed monochloramine, typically a 90 to 237 \n95% reduction was observed (Cowman and Singer, 1996; Guay et al., 2005).  238 \nWhen chlorine was used as the disinfectant (Figure 1), considerable variation was 239 \nobserved between the individual waters with HAA levels ranging from 5.0 to 69 \u00b5g L-1, 240 \nwith an average value of 37 \u00b5g L-1.   This is the first  HAAFP data set published that we 241 \nare aware of for England and Wales, although, Malliarou et al. (2005), earlier reported  242 \nfinished waters from three regions in England and Wales water and found means of 35, 243 \n52 and 95 \u00b5g L-1.   244 \nAcross the chlorinated water samples, the major species formed were TCAA (ranging 245 \nfrom 1.0 to 40 \u00b5g L-1) and DCAA (ranging from 2.5 to 22 \u00b5g L-1). S\u00e9rodes et al. (2003) 246 \nalso found TCAA and DCAA to be the major species formed in treated waters from 247 \nQuebec exposed to FP tests using chlorine. On a mass basis, DCAA and TCAA were 248 \nfollowed here by BDCAA, BCAA, MCAA and DBCAA. The brominated HAAs 249 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 12\nMBAA, DBAA and TBAA were found at the lowest concentration and of these TBAA 250 \nwas not always detected.  251 \nThe ratio of TCAA:DCAA varied across the chlorinated samples, with TCAA being 252 \npredominant in six of the treated waters (B2, L2, UR1, UR2, UR3 and BR1), and 253 \nDCAA for the remaining waters (B1, L1, LR, BR2 and BR3). Similar variations were 254 \nalso observed by S\u00e9rodes et al. (2003) and the excess chlorine used during FP tests as 255 \nwell as the bromine concentration is believed to be the cause. When the bromine 256 \nconcentration was \u2264 75 \u00b5g L-1, TCAA was predominantly formed whilst when a high 257 \nconcentration of bromine (> 100 \u00b5g L-1) (water samples B1, LR, BR2 and BR3) and an 258 \nexcess of chlorine were present, it is believed that bromide reacted to form 259 \nhypobromous acid (HOBr\/OBr-), which is known to react with NOM faster than 260 \naqueous chlorine (Westerhoff et al., 2004).  Consequently, the NaOCl to the NPOC 261 \nratio (NaOCl:NPOC), on a mass basis, decreased as the bromine increased. Miller and 262 \nUden (1983) amongst others found that at lower NaOCl:NPOC, the relative amount of 263 \nDCAA formed was higher than that of TCAA, which was observed here. For example 264 \nBR1, with a bromine concentration of 14 \u00b5g L-1, formed 22 \u00b5g L-1 of DCAA and 40 \u00b5g 265 \nL-1 of TCAA, whereas LR, with a bromine concentration of 209 \u00b5g L-1 formed 16 \u00b5g L-266 \n1 of DCAA and 12 \u00b5g L-1 of TCAA.  267 \nWhen monochloramine was used as the disinfectant the highest concentration of HAAs 268 \nformed was 14 \u00b5g L-1 (L2, LR and BR1) and the average concentration 8.2 \u00b5g L-1 269 \n(Figure 1). DXAAs, and in particular DCAA, were the predominant HAAs formed, 270 \ncomprising at least 60% of the total HAA formation. This is expected as Karanfil et al. 271 \n(2008) and Cowman and Singer (1996) both reported DXAA to be the main HAA 272 \nspecies when using monochloramine and, in their studies, constituted 80 and 65% 273 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 13\nrespectively of the total HAA formed. Monohalogenated HAAs (MXAA) were always 274 \nthe minor HAAs formed and did not contribute more than 20%.   275 \nThe difference in HAA concentrations obtained with chlorine and monochloramine is 276 \nbelieved to be due to different formation routes. When using chlorine, it was concluded 277 \nthat its reaction with NOM preferentially forms TCAA in low bromine-containing 278 \nwaters.  However, the formation mechanism with monochloramine is more complex and 279 \ndifferent models have been proposed in the literature. Karanfil et al. (2007) and Hong et 280 \nal. (2007) both showed that the direct reaction between preformed monochloramine and 281 \nNOM is responsible for about 80% of HAA formation and that the remaining HAA 282 \nformation was attributed to the dissociation of monochloramine to chlorine. Duirk and 283 \nValentine (2006) attributed the formation of DXAA to be mostly from the reaction 284 \nbetween NOM and chlorine in equilibrium with monochloramine. The presence of 285 \nbromide in the samples complicates the chemistry of the system because bromide reacts 286 \nwith free chlorine and\/or monochloramine to form HOBr\/OBr-, bromamines and 287 \nbromochloramine (Diehl et al., 2000). Here, the concentration of TXAA, and especially 288 \nTCAA remains high in many of the monochloraminated samples, such as B1, L2, LR, 289 \nBR2 and BR3, whilst in others, such as UR1 or UR2, the main species was DCAA, 290 \nmaking it unclear as to which mechanism is predominant. 291 \nBromine incorporation 292 \nTo assess the extent of bromine substitution in HAA when using chlorine and 293 \nmonochloramine, the bromine incorporation factor (BIF) was calculated (Symons et al., 294 \n1993): 295 \n)L (\u00b5molHAA\n)L (\u00b5molHAABr\nBIF 1-\n9\n-1\n9= ,      Equation 1 296 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 14\nwhere HAABr9 is the sum of the molar concentrations of bromine incorporated in the 297 \nnine HAA species and HAA9 represents the sum of molar concentrations of all nine 298 \nHAAs. The value BIF can range from zero to three.  Calculated BIF values were plotted 299 \nagainst the bromine concentration (Figure 2) and it was found that the correlation 300 \nbetween BIF and bromine was better in water exposed to monochloramine (R2 = 0.72) 301 \nthan to chlorine (R2 = 0.39). 302 \nOverall the results show that BIF increased with increasing bromine concentrations, 303 \nleading to more brominated HAAs. Also, BIF is higher in chlorinated waters than in 304 \nmonochloraminated waters. Chlorine is a more powerful oxidant and its reaction with 305 \nbromine to form HOBr and then the formation of brominated HAAs will be faster and 306 \nmore predominant than with monochloramine (Deborde and Von Gunten, 2008).  307 \nTHMs and i-THMs 308 \n As with the HAAs, shifting from chlorine to monochloramine produced significantly 309 \nless THMs and the average reduction was 92% (Figure 3).   While using chlorine there 310 \nwas considerable variation in THM levels across the 11 waters with concentrations 311 \nranging from 2.6 to 66 \u00b5g L-1. The average concentration was 30 \u00b5g L-1, which is 312 \nsimilar to the value observed for the HAAs (average of 37 \u00b5g L-1). The lowest 313 \nconcentration of THMs was found in L1 and the highest in LR, followed by L2. These 314 \nresults are similar to those for the HAAs, and specifically, the concentration of TCM 315 \nwas similar to that of TCAA in many samples, indicating possible common precursors. 316 \nFor example, in B2, TCM was 13 \u00b5g L-1 and TCAA was 11 \u00b5g L-1, in UR1, both TCM 317 \nand TCAA were at concentrations of 25 \u00b5g L-1 and in BR1, TCM was 35 \u00b5g L-1 and 318 \nTCAA was 40 \u00b5g L-1. It was observed that L1 had a lower concentration of THMs than 319 \nL2 (2.6 and 47 \u00b5g L-1 respectively), both waters having the same NPOC values, but L1 320 \nhaving a greater SUVA value than L2, which indicates that neither NPOC, nor SUVA 321 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 15\nwere effective surrogates for these two treated waters.   In all the chlorinated waters 322 \nwith bromine < 50 \u00b5g L-1, TCM was found to be the major THM species, whereas in 323 \nthose waters with bromine \u2265 75 \u03bcg L-1 brominated THMs became the major group.  324 \nWhen using monochloramine the concentrations of THMs were mostly below 1 \u00b5g L-1, 325 \naside from B1, LR and BR2. Interestingly, BR2, which had the highest concentration of 326 \nbromine (310 \u00b5g L-1) could form brominated THMs (13 \u00b5g L-1) even when using 327 \nmonochloramine as a disinfectant. 328 \nThe concentrations of two i-THMs were also evaluated (Figure 4). The maximum 329 \nconcentration found here was 0.73 \u00b5g L-1 and most concentrations were below the MRL 330 \nof 0.58 \u00b5g L-1. Cancho et al. (2000) reported average levels lower than 1 \u00b5g L-1 for three 331 \nspecies (DCIM, BCIM and DBIM) in sand filters and ozonated waters, and Krasner et 332 \nal., (2006) reported a maximum of 19 \u00b5g L-1 for six i-THMs with DCIM and BCIM 333 \nbeing the prevalent species. Overall the concentration of i-THMs formed was low when 334 \ncompared to THMs (Figure 4), with the ratio of the i-THMs to THMs being 1% on an 335 \naverage basis and 0.4% on a median basis. Krasner et al. (2006) reported a median ratio 336 \nof 2% for six i-THMs and it known that chlorine can oxidise iodide through to iodate 337 \n(IO3-) and, hence, minimises any potential for i-THM formation (Bichsel and Von 338 \nGunten, 1999). In the formation potential tests reported here chlorine is largely in 339 \nexcess and hence we would expect the formation of  IO3- which is the likely reason  for 340 \nthe low level of i-THMs and the lack of any correlation between the i-THMs and the 341 \niodine level in the water sources. 342 \nThe formation of i-THMs is favoured by monochloramine because monochloramine, 343 \nunlike chlorine, is unable to oxidise hypoiodus acid (HOI) to IO3- meaning that HOI has 344 \na longer lifetime with monochloramine and can react with NOM to form i-THMs 345 \n(Bichsel and Von Gunten, 1999). Here, it was found that levels of i-THMs after 346 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 16\nmonochloramine were between not detected to 0.89 \u00b5g L-1 (Figure 4), with five water 347 \nsamples (B1, B2, L1, L2 and BR2) having greater concentrations of i-THMs than after 348 \nexposure to chlorine, whereas the contrary was observed in LR, UR1, UR2, UR3 and 349 \nBR3.    350 \nHANs 351 \n When using chlorine, HANs were detected in all waters and their concentrations were 352 \ntypically an order of magnitude lower than the concentrations of THMs and HAAs 353 \n(Figure 5). Total HAN concentrations ranged between 0.023 and 5.5 \u00b5g L-1, which is in 354 \nline with the findings of Krasner et al. (2007), who reported levels of dihalogenated 355 \nHANs between approximately 0.80 \u00b5g L-1 and 6.2 \u00b5g L-1 when using FP tests. DCAN 356 \nwas the major HAN formed and contributed up to 56% of the total HAN, followed by 357 \nBCAN (27%), DBAN (16%) and TCAN (2%). Dihalogenated HANs are reported to be 358 \nmore stable than the trihalogenated HANs by a number of authors (Peters et al., 1990; 359 \nSinger et al., 1995). In addition, TCAN can undergo base-catalysed hydrolysis at pH 360 \nhigher than 5.5 (here, the pH was 7.2) which is likely to explain why it was rarely 361 \ndetected in this study (Crou\u00e9 and Reckhow, 1989). 362 \nDCAN was the most abundant species found in chlorinated waters containing levels of 363 \nbromine < 50 \u00b5g L-1. In the waters with bromine \u2265 75 \u00b5g L-1 the brominated HANs 364 \n(BCAN and DBAN) were dominant (67% total HAN). Peters et al. (1990) reported a 365 \nsimilar value with the brominated dihalogenated HANs accounting for 60% of the total 366 \nHAN in Dutch surface waters with bromide concentrations \u2265 500 \u00b5g L-1. Here the 367 \nlowland waters L1, BR2 and BR3 produced more HANs which is expected as these 368 \nsources are more likely to contain dissolved organic nitrogen, the main precursor for 369 \nHANs (Oliver et al., 1983).   The speciation observed was again dependent on the 370 \npresence of bromine. For example BR2, which contains 310 \u00b5g L-1 of bromine, formed 371 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 17\nmainly BCAN and DBAN (0.31 and 0.39 \u00b5g L-1 respectively), whereas UR2 with a 372 \nbromine concentration of 18 \u00b5g L-1 formed 0.013 and 0.014 \u00b5g L-1 for both BCAN and 373 \nDBAN, but 0.26 \u00b5g L-1 of DCAN.  374 \n Changing from chlorine to monochloramine decreased the concentration of HANs by 375 \n81% (Figure 5). Hua and Reckhow (2007) also found that concentrations of HAN were 376 \nreduced by between 93% and 100% when using monochloramine and little 377 \ndihalogenated HANs (<1 \u00b5g L-1) were formed.  378 \n 379 \nHKs, HAs and HNMs 380 \nThe concentrations of the two HKs formed following exposure to chlorine and 381 \nmonochloramine are presented (Figure 6). HKs were detected in all the treated waters 382 \nexposed to chlorine (Figure 6), with concentrations ranging from 0.37 to 3.9 \u00b5g L-1, 383 \nwith a mean value of 1.8 \u00b5g L-1. The highest concentration was observed in BR1, 384 \nwhereas the lowest concentration was observed in L1 and B1.   1,1,1-TCP was the 385 \nmajor HK formed in B2, L2, LR, UR1, UR2, UR3, BR1, BR2 and BR3. The greater 386 \nformation of 1,1,1-TCP in the samples is believed to be the result of the excess chlorine 387 \nused in FP tests, involving the oxidation of 1,1-DCP to 1,1,1-TCP (Gurol et al., 1983). 388 \nThe use of monochloramine resulted on average in a decrease of 70% in the total HK 389 \ncompared to the use of chlorine (Figure 6).  No 1,1,1-TCP was detected which, given 390 \nthat monochloramine does not provide enough free chlorine to push further substitution 391 \ninto 1,1-DCP, was expected (Yang et al. (2007)  392 \nHAs were present in all samples after 24 hours contact time with chlorine (Figure 7). 393 \nThe minimum value was 0.92 \u00b5g L-1 for L1 and the maximum value was 9.5 \u00b5g L-1 for 394 \nBR1. The average of HAs formed was 4.4 \u00b5g L-1 and this group of DBPs represented 395 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 18\nthe third major class of halogenated DBPs formed (on a weight basis) after HAAs and 396 \nTHMs.  The major HA detected was TCA (also called chloral hydrate) and Williams et 397 \nal. (1997) also found TCA to be the most prevalent DBP after HAAs and THMs.  398 \nKoudjonou et al. (2008) also reported TCA in drinking water made up 60% of the total 399 \nHA. Ozonation is known to increase the levels of DCA and TCA (Weinberg et al., 400 \n1993) and here if we consider the two boreholes B1 and B2 they have different 401 \nconcentrations of HKs, with B2, the pre-ozonated site, having a greater formation 402 \npotential for DCA (0.62 \u00b5g L-1) and TCA (2.4 \u00b5g L-1) than B1 (0.31 and 0.61 \u00b5g L-1 403 \nrespectively), which has no ozone.   The use of monochloramine resulted on average in 404 \na 90% decrease in the total HA concentration (Figure 7).    405 \nThe total concentration of HNMs measured after exposure to chlorine ranged from not 406 \ndetected to 3.4 \u00b5g L-1 (Figure 8). The predominant HNM was TCNM and the 407 \nconcentrations are in agreement with Krasner et al. (2001) who reported TCNM 408 \nconcentrations of up to 2.0 \u00b5g L-1. DBNM was detected here in B1, B2, L2, LR, BR2 409 \nand BR3, with the highest concentration found in BR2. Although other researchers have 410 \nshown that pre-ozonation can increase the formation of TCNM (Hoign\u00e9 and Bader, 411 \n1988) or other HNMs (Plewa et al., 2004), it was not possible to see this trend here. The 412 \nhighest concentration of HNMs was observed in BR1, a lowland river, followed by 413 \nUR1, which is an upland reservoir.  On average the concentration of HNM was reduced 414 \nby 81% when using monochloramine and agrees with the recent findings of Hua and 415 \nReckhow (2007) who showed that when using monochloramine only traces 416 \nconcentrations of TCNM and those of Zhang et al. (2000) who reported a decrease of 417 \n58% with monochloramine in comparison to chlorine.  418 \n 419 \n 420 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 19\nRelative toxicity of DBPs measured 421 \nAlthough, HAAs and THMs were more significant in regards to the mass concentration 422 \nthan the semi-volatile DBPs, it should be noted that the toxicity of some of the semi-423 \nvolatile DBPs is much higher than the toxicity for HAAs and THMs. As shown in 424 \nFigure 9, Plewa et al. (2008) reported that the genotoxicity and the cytotoxicity were 425 \nmuch higher for the nitrogen-containing compounds HANs and HNMs than the THMs 426 \nand HAAs. Furthermore, the same authors reported that the iodo- and bromo-DBPs 427 \nwere more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated counterparts, and this is 428 \nbecause iodine and bromine are better leaving groups than chlorine due to their greater 429 \npolarisable bondings (Woo et al., 2002). Therefore, here, despite their lower 430 \nconcentrations, some of the semi-volatile DBPs are more significant than HAAs and 431 \nTHMs from a health standpoint. 432 \n 433 \nRelationships between HAAs, THMs and other DBPs 434 \nHere the correlation between HAAs and THMs was investigated (Figure 10) and it was 435 \nfound that for the waters evaluated that THMs were generally a good surrogate for 436 \nHAAs when chlorine was used (coefficient of correlation R2 = 0.82).  The slope of this 437 \ncorrelation was 1.21, which suggests that there is slightly more than one microgram of 438 \nHAA formed for one microgram of THM.  No correlation could be found between 439 \nTHM and HAAs when using monochloramine.   Malliarou et al. (2005) also reported a 440 \ngood relationship between THM and HAAs in final waters from two geographically 441 \ndifferent regions in England and Wales (R2 = 0.82 and 0.90), whereas they found a poor 442 \ncorrelation in the waters of their third region investigated and suggested that total THM 443 \ncould not be assumed to be a good indicator for HAA levels.  Moderate relationships 444 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 20\nwere also found between the total THM and the sum of the semi-volatile DBPs (HAN, 445 \nHA, HK, i-THM and HNM) measured after exposure to chlorine (Figure 10). The R2 446 \nobtained for the collated semi-volatile DBPs was 0.68, which is in line with a previous 447 \ncorrelation (R2 = 0.76) found between total THM and non-THM DBPs in drinking 448 \nwaters (Krasner et al., 1989). This correlation suggests that the control of THM 449 \nprecursors is closely linked to the control of other DBP precursors. As explained by 450 \nKrasner et al. (1989) this trend is valid for the sum of the measured halogenated DBPs 451 \nbut it does not give similar trends for individual compounds; e.g. comparing total THMs 452 \nto HNMs yields an R2 of only 0.08. In terms of regulation, it is interesting to note that 453 \nthe regulatory limit of 100 \u00b5g L-1 for the THM4 would fail a regulation of 80 \u00b5g L-1 for 454 \nthe nine HAAs, currently under consideration by the European Union (Cortvriend, 455 \n2008). Indeed from the correlation found here, if 100 \u00b5g L-1 of THM4 would be formed, 456 \nit would be expected to form 121 \u00b5g L-1 of HAA9. In the specific waters investigated 457 \nhere, to achieve a concentration of 80 \u00b5g L-1 for HAA9, THM4 should be no higher that 458 \n65 \u00b5g L-1. 459 \n 460 \nRelationships between NPOC, UV and SUVA with DBPs 461 \nRelationships between NPOC, UV and SUVA with HAAs, THMs and the semi-volatile 462 \nDBPs were investigated with chlorine FP test data. NPOC, UV and SUVA have been 463 \nused previously as surrogates for measuring DBPs as they are easier, cheaper and faster 464 \nto measure than DBPs (Goslan et al., 2002; Parsons et al., 2005; Ates et al., 2007). 465 \nFirstly, HAAs, THMs and semi-volatile DBPs have been correlated against NPOC and 466 \ncorrelation (R2 values) between NPOC and HAAs, THMs and the semi-volatile DBPs 467 \n(collated together) were moderate (0.51, 0.63 and 0.56 respectively).   Although 468 \nstronger correlations have been reported, such as White et al.

In terms of semi-volatile DBPs as separate species it was 472 \nobserved that NPOC correlated well with HANs (R2 = 0.82) and moderately with HAs 473 \n(R2 = 0.52) (Table 3). However, no correlations were found between NPOC with i-474 \nTHMs, HNMs and HKs.  No correlations were found between either SUVA or UV254 475 \nand DBPs was also investigated (Table 3).  476 \n 477 \nConclusions 478 \n\u2022 The results have shown how all the waters have the potential to form significant 479 \nlevels of all the DBPs monitored for and that in general a decrease in 480 \nconcentration was been observed when shifting from chlorine to 481 \nmonochloramine, the one exception being 1,1-DCP.     482 \n\u2022 In general the concentrations of THMs correlated well with HAAs, and in 483 \nparticular the levels of TCM were similar to the levels of TCAA supporting the 484 \nhypothesis that they share similar precursor material.    485 \n\u2022 The impact of bromide on the formation of DBPs is well documented in the 486 \nliterature and here the data reaffirmed that more bromide species are formed in 487 \nhigh bromide-containing waters. For HAAs, brominated species are 488 \npredominant when bromine was > 100 \u00b5g L-1, whereas the brominated THMs 489 \ndominated when bromine was \u2265 75 \u00b5g L-1.  490 \n\u2022  The use of FP test was found here to be unsuitable for the quantification of i-491 \nTHMs as the high chlorine levels are likely to limit formation.   492 \n 493 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n \n 22\nAcknowledgements 494 \nAnglian Water, Northumbrian Water Limited, Severn Trent Water, United Utilities and 495 \nYorkshire Water are gratefully acknowledged for their financial support.
