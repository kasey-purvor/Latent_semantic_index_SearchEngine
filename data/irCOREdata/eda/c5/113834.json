In doing so,\nI explore the ways in which visuals in particular photography and  subsequent  visualities,  enliven\ntourists\u2019  becoming  through  a  multiplicity  of  fluid  and  dynamic  performances,  practices  and\nprocesses. Influenced by research by authors such as Crang (1997, 1999), I suggest photography is\nnot merely an empty practice, but rather lights up the tourist experience. The  emerging  dynamics\nof visual practice renegotiate new understandings between tourists and place to  establish  a  series\nof conceptual moments that outline photography as: political artefacts, reflexive performances, the\nimagination of  space,  embodied  visualities  and  ethical  prompts.  Such  conceptualisations  and\npractices of tourist photography are by no means  arbitrary,  but  are  situated  in  a  framework  of\nvisuality that highlights key moments of anticipation,  rewriting  and  remembrance  and  reliving.\nThus, moving beyond notions of the hermeneutic cycle  of  travel,  photographs  and  photography\nare understood as complex performative spaces  that  extend  beyond  divisible  boundaries  of  the\nbefore, during and after travel experiences and infiltrate the entire tourist experience.\nINTRODUCTION\nPhotography and the visual have long been understood as  fundamental  to  tourism  and  over  the\npast few decades, the visual and visual practice in tourism  has  received  steady  attention  from  a\nrange of disciplines. Yet, while research addresses conceptualisations of the visual in tourism  (see\namongst others: Adler, 1989; Crang, 1999; Meltzer,  2002;  Ritzer  &  Liska,  1997;  Urry,  1990),\nthere continues to be relatively limited direct, theoretical application and empirical attention to the\npractices through which photographs both produce and are produced by tourists. While  some  like\nCrang (1997), Edensor (1998) and Jokinen  &  Veijola  (2003)  have  attended  to  photography  in\ntourism, their research remains adhoc  and  sits  alongside  discussions  of  visual  practice  via  an\neclectic array of other media such as postcards (see Edwards  (1996),  Waitt  &  Head  (2002)  and\nMoors (2002; 2003), television, video and cinema (see Crouch & Grassick,  2005;  Edensor  2005;\nDavin, 2005, Fish, 2005, Pollock, 2003), art (Lai, 2004) and monuments (Mills, 2003). Indeed,  as\nBaerenholdt  et  al  (2007)  suggest:  \u201calthough  photography  is  perhaps  the  emblematic   tourist\npractice and  tourist  studies  have  been  dominated  by  a  visual  paradigm,  tourist  studies  have\nproduced little knowledge of how and why tourists are  busy  producing  photographic  images\u201d  (:\n69).\nThis  paper  therefore  aims  to  further  contribute  to  existing  knowledge   of   photography   and\nphotographic practice in tourism. First, I draw upon  recent  shifts  in  understanding  tourism  and\ntourist practice that have emerged in  the  last  decade.  Being  a  tourist  is  no  longer  a  series  of\ndiscrete, isolate moments (Franklin & Crang,  2001;  Coleman  &  Crang,  2002;  Franklin,  2003).\nTourists do not simply, as Albers & James (1984) and Urry (1990) suggest, exist in a hermeneutic\ncycle driven by a set of predetermined knowledges and behaviours with a  distinct  beginning  and\nend.  Rather,  tourism  emerges  as  intersubjective  connection  to  and  accommodation  of  other,\nthrough which a multiplicity of subjectivities are performed (Coleman &  Crang,  2001).  There  is\nno beginning and no end, but a series of rhythms, flows and fluxes, in-between  points  and  stages\nthat tourists move in and around. I therefore propose visuals and visual practice are not mere aides\nin the tourist experience, but emerge through fluid interplays that light up the process of becoming\nby instilling life and mobilising deeper affiliations between self and other.\nSecond, to explore the role of photographs and photography in such encounter,  it  is  necessary  to\nembrace tourism as a series of active doings through performative engagement (for  example  Bell\n& Lyall, 2002; Coleman & Crang, 2002; Crang,  1997;  Edensor,  1998,  2001).  Photographs  and\nphotography facilitate the enlivening and creation of place and experience  and  as  Crang  (1997a)\nsupposes, allow tourists to take  part  in  rather  than  reflect  upon  the  world.  As  co-performers,\nphotographs frame place and  allow  experiences  to  be  created,  encountered  and  preserved  via\nphysical, intellectual and cognitive  activity  (Perkins  and  Thorns,  2001).  However,  as  Edensor\n(2001) and Franklin & Crang (2001)  realise,  reflexive  awareness  demands  inherent  difference.\nThus,  visual  practice  emerges  as  a  series  of  intersubjective  negotiations.  It  is  an  arena   for\nnegotiation and play as photographs and photography offer opportunity to explore  place  (Sontag,\n1979) and access previously hidden behaviours, senses and engagements. My concern therefore  is\nto  unpack  the  integral  role  of  visuals  and  the  diversity  of  visual  practice  and   identify   the\nopportunities  through  which  tourists  both  produce  and   are   produced   by   photographs   and\nphotography.\nFurthermore, this paper contributes to current debate on the multisensuality of  tourism.  Prompted\nby the need to rebalance the  domination  of  the  visual,  research  has  embraced  the  plurality  of\nsensual interplays of tourist practice and the subjective, reflexive positioning of the tourist via  lay\nknowledges  (see  Crang,  1999;  Crouch,  2000a\/b,  2002;  Franklin  &  Crang,  2001;  Veijola   &\nJokinen, 1994; Wylie, 2002). Some, like Game (1991) go so far  as  to  emphasise  the  body  over\nsight. While such an approach is fundamental  to  understanding  tourists\u2019  experiences,  following\nHarraway\u2019s (1991) call for the embodied nature of all vision, I propose visuals and visual  practice\nexist  through  the  fusion  of  all  senses  as   tourists   move   through   place   imaginatively   and\nexperientially. The visual exists as a series of embodied practices as tourists  encounter  the  world\nmultisensually and multidimensionally (Crouch & L\u00fcbbren,  2003).  Moving  beyond  perceptions\nthrough which photographs and photography are \u201cportrayed as a static, distanced and disembodied\nencounter with the world\u201d (Baerenholdt et al, 2007: 101), I embrace the  sensual  poesis  of  visual\npractice as it emerges via the materiality and corporeality of the body. In doing so, I  aim  to  offer\nfurther insight into the practices through which photographs and photography become  implicit  in\nproducing experiences, concrete bodily performances and tangible memories. \nFinally, as embodied practice and performance, I suggest  photographs  and  photography  become\nimbued in tourism as the practice of self in everyday life (see Chaney, 1993;  Crang,  1997,  1999,\nColeman & Crang,  2002;  Edensor,  2001;  Franklin,  2003).  The  everydayness  of  photography\nemerges as the repetition of habitual and polydimensional nature of non-habitual practices fuse  to\nmobilise new possibilities (Edensor, 2001). Thus, I suggest, it is this  very  union  of  habitual  and\nnon-habitual,  the  expected  and  unexpected  that  positions  photographs   and   photography   as\nfundamental to the ways in which tourists are able to explore and  accommodate  other.  Secondly,\neverydayness emerges as the materiality of photographs mobilise a \u2018touring\u2019 (Bell & Lyall,  2002;\nLury, 1997; Rojek, 1997; Rojek & Urry, 1997) in which photographed  subjects  transcend  spatial\nand  temporal  boundaries  to  infiltrate  domestic  and  work  spaces  (see  Rose,  2003).   Whether\ninferring   potential   experiences,   capturing   encounters   or   providing   spaces    for    reflexive\nperformance, as Franklin & Crang (2001) suggest, it is the role of the  visual  and  the  transitional\nspaces of visualities as transcending physical boundaries that interest lies.\nMy concern is therefore to address the multiplicity of ways  in  which  photographs  both  produce\nand are produced by tourists. The next section  develops  my  argument  as  I  propose  a  series  of\nconceptual moments of photography.  Following  that,  I  propose  a  framework  of  visuality  that\nidentifies the moments at which such conceptualisations arise in the temporal and spatial diversity\nof  photographic  practices  of  both  industry  and  tourists.  However,  before   proceeding,   it   is\nnecessary to outline the case study on which analysis is based, as to discuss the  \u201cvisual  practices\u201d\nof the tourist experience risks potential overgeneralisation. Research was conducted in the context\nof Peru, with 16 semi-structured interviews conducted with British tourists at three stages of  their\nexperience: pre-travel, mid-travel and post-travel. Of these, 6 were  longitudinal.  Tourists  ranged\nin age from early 20\u2019s to late 70\u2019s and were a  balance  of  male  and  female.  All  were  first-time\nvisitors to Peru and travelled as part of a  2-week  organised  tour.  Pre-travel  interviews  explored\nanticipatory  practices  using  tourist  brochures.  Mid-travel  interviews  were   conducted   during\nrespondents\u2019 holidays in Peru and focused on postcards. Post-travel interviews were conducted on\ntourists return home and addressed  tourists\u2019  own  photographs.  In  addition,  10  semi-structured\ninterviews were conducted with UK-based tour operators  and  used  tourist  brochures  to  unpack\npractices of brochure construction and 8 semi-structured interviews were conducted with  postcard\nproducers in  Peru.  Interviews  aimed  to  provide  rich  insights  into  practice  and  access  to  the\nmultiplicity of tacit knowledges and non-representable intricacies of tourists\u2019 visual practice.\nHowever, in order to access the nuances of photographic practice, interviews were supported  with\nauthoethnography as I embarked on my  own  two-week  trip  around  the  \u201ctourist  trail\u201d  of  Peru.\nAutoethnography emerged as a fusion of observation  and  first-hand  experience.   It  provides  an\navenue through which researcher subjectivity  is  embraced  within  the  research  setting  (see  for\nexample: Church, 1995; Morgan & Pritchard, 2005; Sparkes,  2000;  Westwood  et  al,  2006).  As\nKrieger (1996) suggests, autoethnography explicitly discusses the experiences and presence of the\nresearcher in the research context. Thus, the \u2018I\u2019 becomes  resituated  in  research  and  generates  a\nseries of affiliations and insights to develop a fuller  sense  of  self  so  that  our  understanding  of\nothers   will   not   become   fractured   or   artificial.   Autoethnography   therefore   goes   beyond\nsubjectivities (Coffey, 2005). Subjectivities are balanced through a flexible,  shared  responsibility\nas both researcher and respondent reveal their inner selves to the research. As such, a kinaesthetic,\nembodied approach to understanding tourist practices emerges  via  a  process  of  self-witnessing,\nthus generating what some tourist respondents like Martin, referred to as a \u201ctravel  connection\u201d  as\nwe anticipated, travelled through and remembered our experiences  of  Peru.  Thus,  moving  from\n\u201cresearcher\u201d  to  \u201cresearcher-as-fellow-tourist\u201d,  I  established   common   ground   and   discussed\ndifferences in practice with respondents. Interviews  became  rich  negotiations  via  sharing,  trust\nand mutual understanding  of  tacit  knowledges  and  experiences  that  would  perhaps  otherwise\nremain hidden. Yet, despite such rich insights, I later  suggest  that  the  place  specificity  of  Peru\nmay result in particular aspects of visual practice being exclusive to this location.\nCONCEPTUAL MOMENTS OF THE VISUAL\nAs  aforementioned,  interest  lies   in   the   multiplicity   of   photographic   practices   performed\nthroughout tourists\u2019 experiences. Such practices are  imbued  with  complex  relations  of  politics,\nspace, agency, embodiment  and  ethics  and  it  is  to  this  that  attention  now  turns.  In  thinking\nthrough such issues, I propose a framework of conceptual moments that positions photography as:\npolitical artefacts, reflexive  performances,  the  imagination  of  space,  embodied  visualities  and\nethical prompts. While delineated for discussion, conceptualisations  are  not  mutually  exclusive,\nbut  exist  within  permeable  boundaries  that  arise  at  varying   intensities   throughout   tourists\u2019\nexperiences. They offer a foundation to explore visual practice as tourists  engage  with  place  via\nimagined and experiential encounters. However, it is important to emphasise that  tourists  are  not\nheroic, autonomous  creatures.  Rather,  they  are  inherently  intersubjective  and  visual  practices\nemerge through  a  fusion  of  collective  and  individual,  staged  and  immanent,  imaginings  and\nexperiential performances in a fluid negotiation of landscape (Wylie, 2003).\nFirstly, photographs are political artefacts. As Rose (2003) suggests, they  are  objects;  things  to\nwhich  other  things  are  done.  They  are  given  purpose  in  accordance  with  use   as   they   are\nconstituted,  materialised  and  endowed  with  meaning.  Visuals  become  analogous  to  multiple\n\u201cspace odysseys\u201d (Lash & Urry, 1994: 15). They are  continually  de-  and  re-contextualised  as  a\nrange  of  social  forms  and  individuals  influence  tourists\u2019  encounters  with   place   (Halfacree,\nforthcoming). Such politicisation is embedded in tourism as we are surrounded by  a  proliferation\nof actors and media (e.g. tour operators, tour guides, postcard producers, television and films) that\nframe destinations according to preferred discourses. Thus, practices of staging and scripting  (see\nEdensor,  1998)  mobilise  a  \u201cdirected  gazing\u201d  (Urry,  1990)  of  place  as  destinations   become\nchoreographed with  \u201ccultural  scripts  and  material  regulations\u201d  (Baerenholdt  et  al,  2007:  71).\nVisuals therefore become established as signs that guide tourists\u2019 interpretations.  They  are  never\nsimple representations, but are constructed as mediated discursive  spaces  (Scarles,  2004).  Thus,\ntourists become partially locked within collective considerations that  enframe  destinations  using\ndistinctive icons that minimise possibilities of articulating alternative  narratives  (Meethan,  1996;\nMorgan & Pritchard, 1998). For Peru, such narratives centre on Machu  Picchu  (see  figure  1)  as\n\u201cthat is why most people want to go\u2026to visit  Machu  Picchu\u201d  (Julia,  tour  operator).  Discursive\nframeworks reinforce familiar narratives of lost cities, ancient civilisations and  spirituality.  Thus,\nvisual practices reinforce the collective gaze; facilitating  tourists\u2019  partial  understandings  of  that\nwhich may be encountered.\nOnce at destinations, politicised discourses continue to direct tourists\u2019 practice as they  are  guided\nby both human (e.g. tour guide) and non-human agents (e.g. brochures, signs) (Baerenholdt  et  al,\n2007). Whether driven by compulsion or obligation, tourists engage in practices of  \u2018hunting\u2019  and\n\u2018capturing\u2019 as they fulfil anticipations of destinations. As Abby said: \u201cI wanted to take\u2026photos of\nMachu Picchu because I had seen so many photos\u2026and it  looked  exactly  like  I  thought  it  was\ngoing to look like\u201d. Thus, tourists perform place in response to the collective gaze (Baerenholdt et\nal, 2007).  Like Abby and Jim (see figure 2), I too felt the compulsion to capture the classic view.\nFigure  1-3  (left  to  right):  Machu  Picchu,  Steppes  Latin   America,   2003:   22;   Recreating   the   Classic   View,\nRespondent\u2019s Photograph; Personalising Machu Picchu, Author\u2019s Own Collection.\nHowever,  I   suggest   the   intersubjectivity   of   touristic   practice   extends   beyond   collective\nunderstandings as tourists embark on a personal politicisation of place. For Angela, Machu Picchu\nbecame synonymous with tranquillity: \u201cI am a great lover of total quiet and I am hoping I will  get\nthat\u201d, while Paula anticipated feelings of spirituality: \u201cit\u2019s a sacred site, so you  expect  it  to  have\nsomething spiritual about it\u201d.  Thus,  collective  understandings  become  infused  with  subjective\nreflexive engagement as tourists situate their  self  alongside  other.  Following  Barthes  (1981),  I\nsuggest as objects photographs are invisible and are not only what  is  seen.  Rather,  they  become\ninexhaustible invitations to subjective interpretation. They offer enigmatic  spaces  through  which\ntourists  personalise  place  as  they  connect   the   materiality   of   experiential   encounters   with\nideological imaginings and perform that which may not be directly seen, or even exist.\nFinally, such politicising and personalising of the collective gaze embraces  not  only  ideological,\nbut also experiential encounter as photography corporealises encounter  and  transforms  distanced\nspectators into active directors who produce new realities (Baerenholdt et al, 2007;  Crang,  1997).\nThrough visual practice tourists socialise destinations; selectively acting out place and creating co-\npresences  between  self  and  other.  Photography  provides  opportunities  to   selectively   author\ndestinations. It becomes a performance in itself as tourists search to \u2018be\u2019 in place. As Maggie said:\n\u201cit\u2019s a (Maggie)-eyed view\u2026its more personal\u2026it\u2019s like what I was doing\u2026what I was  seeing  at\nthe  time\u201d.  Indeed,  at  Machu  Picchu,  photography  facilitated  my  appreciation  of   place:   the\nworkmanship, the texture of the stones and the enormity of the surrounding landscape  (see  figure\n3).  For  others,  it  mobilised  deeper  political  narratives,  as  icons  of  brightly  clothed,  smiling\nchildren gave  way  to  experiences  of  poverty:  \u201cshe  was  filthy\u2026I  (photographed)\u2026because  I\nwanted to\u2026remember what this child was like\u2026the poverty she was living in\u201d (Les, see figure 4).\nFigure 4: Child, Respondent\u2019s Photograph                  Figure 5: Cusco Festival, Authors Own Collection\nRelated to photographs as political artefact, is their position as reflexive performance. As  Phelan\n(1997) suggests,  photographs  create  \u201cblind  images\u201d  as  selectivity  in  their  production  creates\npresences  and  absences  that  divert  attention  from  less  desirable  place   elements.   Thus,   the\npleasures of looking embrace a sense of forgetting and concealing parts of  the  world  that  we  do\nnot wish to preserve (Mulvey, 1986). While some tourists accommodate  issues  such  as  political\nprotest, others like Angela, photograph only desirable  or  aesthetically  pleasing  experiences  that\nreinforce desired experience and place narratives: \u201cif something is not  pretty,  it\u2019s  not  worthy  of\nbeing   photographed\u201d.   Likewise,   I   photographed   the   festival   in   Cusco   (see    figure    5),\nsimultaneously preserving pleasant memories of music, dancing  and  excitement  while  eclipsing\nthose of barking dogs and feelings of  altitude  sickness.  Visual  practice  therefore  emerges  as  a\nseries  of  negotiations  and  compromises  as  tourists  merge   ideological   imaginings   with   the\nunfolding  realities  of  place.  It  becomes  an  endless  proprioception  of   fragments   of   reality.\nPhotographs and photography facilitate the authoring and creation of extensions  of  self  in  place;\nsimultaneously capturing moments as lived and securing projected memories.  Thus,  photographs\nbecome catalysts (Leslie, 2000. cit. Franklin &  Crang,  2001);  bridging  moments  and  providing\nselective pathways for reflexive performances in another place and time.\nAs Barthes (1977) suggests, interpreting photographs is to lend them a past and  future  and  insert\nthem into a  narrative  through  the  suggestion  of  \u201chaving  been  there\u201d.  Spatial  immediacy  and\ntemporal  anteriority  arise  as  the  \u201chere-now\u201d  and  \u201cthere-then\u201d  combine  into  \u201cthat-which-has-\nbeen\u201d. Yet, I argue memory does not conform to linear conception of time,  but  as  Berger  (1978)\nsuggests, is \u2018radial\u2019 with concern for desire, contradiction and  self-reflexivity.  Memories  do  not\nrepeat  encounters  mimetically.  Rather,  they  work  radially   with   \u201can   enormous   number   of\nassociations\u2026leading  to  the  same  event\u201d  (ibid:   46).   Thus,   the   subjectivities   of   reflexive\nperformance infiltrate the entire tourist experience and emerge through a variety of  practices.  For\nexample, as Donna anticipated place she related her experience of  Tunisian  sooks  to  understand\npossible  experiences  at  Peruvian  Indian  markets,  while  Angela  hoped  Machu  Picchu  would\n\u201crecreate the feeling that I felt standing on the Serengeti\u201d. I therefore suggest, photographs are not\nmemories in themselves for that would indicate a misconstrued interpretation of photography as  a\nreplacement for memory (see Sontag, 1979). Rather, they offer \u201cfractured pasts\u201d (Nora, 1996) that\nemerge as \u201cmemorial sites\u201d upon which theatres of memory  are  constructed  (Crang  &  Travlou,\n2001). They become  co-performers  in  the  creation  and  subsistence  of  memories;  a  series  of\nguiding structures upon which remembrances are inscribed as places are produced  and  consumed\nvia ideology-fuelled stories (Hirsch, 1981, 1997; Rose, 2003).\nAs  reflexive  performance,  photographs  are  also  \u201cbeacons  of  personal,   floating,   meaningful\nmemory\u201d  (Cloke  &  Pawson,  forthcoming:  16).  They  ignite  embodied  reflections  that  extent\nbeyond the materiality of the photograph. For Tom, photographs reminded him of  \u201chow  dynamic\nthe landscape was, the cloud\u2026surging backwards and forwards\u201d, while  Olivia  relived  the  \u201ctotal\nisolation\u201d  she  felt  standing  on  the  Altiplano.  However,  despite   the   intensity   of   embodied\nreflexivity, photographs provide closure as experiences become compartmentalised. They become\nconcretised as history and (generally) stored out of sight as there comes the point \u201cwhere you  just\nleave it to rest and it stays in an album\u201d (Gillian).  Yet, the role of photographs  as  memorial  sites\nand the radial nature of memory demands such closure is never absolute. Rather, photography and\nphotographs become building blocks as memories fuse in an amalgam of  reflective  performances\nof experiences that-have-been with those that-may-be in the future. The dynamics of memory  and\nmemorialisation  call  forth  moments  of  sporadic  reencounter   as   tourists   advise   friends   on\ndestinations, reflect on  past  experiences  in  times  of  boredom,  or  make  sense  of  forthcoming\nexperiences (Franklin & Crang, 2001, Crang & Travlou,  2001):  \u201cto  think  about  having  another\nholiday\u2026what was china really like? Did we enjoy that?\u201d (Alison).  Nevertheless, it  is  inevitable\nthat memories transform and fade. They are chameleon-like; morphing and camouflaging  as  they\nare  called  upon  to  serve  purpose  as  we  constantly  revise  our  memories  to  suit  our  current\nidentities  (Gillis,  1994).  Such  morphing  mobilises  an  impersonal  popularisation  of   memory\n(Edensor, 1998) as intimate memories fade  into  memoryscapes.  \u2018True\u2019  memories  are  gradually\nreplaced and are left in the shadow of ambiguity between the past and our present  day  reading  of\nit (Johnson, 1999). Over time, reflexive performances call forth  idealised  imaginings  as  realities\nare replaced and tourists building affinities with place as imaged (Travlou, 2002).  The  intricacies\nof beacons of personal experience  become  eroded  and  contain  experiences  to  dominant,  well-\nrehearsed narratives.\nThe third conceptual moment is  the  imagination  of  space.  As  Crang  (1997)  suggests,  visual\npractice mobilises the enworldment of place as tourists reach out to grasp the  world.  Photographs\nand photography create established realities; routes through which subjective  worlds  are  created,\napprehended  and  enframed.  I  propose  such  enworldment  arises  as   tourists   \u2018step   into\u2019   the\nintangible spaces of photographs via reflexive practice. Moving through the vortex  of  the  visual,\ntourists  create  spaces  of  dislocation  as  imagined  and  abstract  spaces   merge   in   a   swirling\nconnection of real and imaginary, self  and  other.  Consequently,  tourists  become  (re)positioned\nwithin the photographed subject as they are consumed by the visual, as  it  is  consumed  by  them.\nThey become imaginative voyagers; enlivening photographed subjects and making  place  legible.\nIndeed, it is the inherent instability of visuals (DeCerteau, 1997, cit. Crang, 2000) that leaves them\nvulnerable to intersubjective interpretation. Thus, space  for  creativity  unfolds  as  tourists  fill  in\ngaps and come to know a place and their role within it. As Maggie  said,  she  could:  \u201calmost  feel\nlike what I hope it will be like to be there\u2026I could imagine one of these people as me\u201d (see figure\n6). Such practice becomes dependant on the interests  and  motivations  of  each  tourist.  Figure  7\nignited Sarah\u2019s passion for walking: \u201cI love walking\u2026you know that would be  brilliant,  smelling\nall the fresh flowers and the herbs\u201d. Alternatively, figure 8 fuelled  Angela\u2019s  embodied  memories\nof her time on the Ballestas Islands: \u201cit\u2019s the smells, it\u2019s the sounds\u2026the sensations  of  sitting  on\nthat  bloody  boat  going  up  and  down\u201d.   Therefore,   while   the   frequency   and   intensity   of\n(re)positioning self via the vortex of the visual inevitably varies amongst tourists, the  imagination\nof space focuses on the relationship between self and other.  Photographed  subjects  are  mediated\nas  tourists  draw  upon  imaginings  and  experiential  encounters  to  create  an  active,  embodied\nengagement with the world (Crang, 1997).  Thus,  photographs  become  lived  spaces  as  tourists\noverlay physical space  with  imagined  space  and  create  illusions  of  transparency  and  opacity\n(Lefebvre, 1991); creating relational views of space through intersubjective experience.\nFigures 6\u20138: (anticlockwise from top left): Group at Machu  Picchu,   Guerba  Worldwide  Adventure  and  Discovery\nHolidays Brochure, 2004-2005; Comercocha  Lake,  Peru,  Guerba  Worldwide  Adventure  and  Discovery  Holidays\nBrochure, 2004-2005; Ballestas Islands, Respondent\u2019s Photograph.\nThe fourth conceptual moment positions photographs as embodied visualities. Ultimately tourists\nnever  understand  anything  from  the  click  of  a  shutter  button.  Rather,  encountering  place  is\nimplicit in the materiality and  corporeality  of  the  body  (see  Crouch,  2000a\/b,  Edensor,  1998,\nFranklin & Crang, 2001, Jokinen & Veijola, 2003). As Walker & Chaplin  (1997)  suggest,  vision\nand  subsequent  visual  practices  use  not  only   our   eyes,   but   our   minds,   bodies,   genders,\npersonalities and histories. Thus, tourists\u2019 photography is inspired not only that which is seen,  but\ntouched, tasted, heard and smelt. Such multisensuality arises in  many  guises  whether  driven  by\nPeter\u2019s exhilaration of reaching a summit, Sarah\u2019s reflection on  the  laughter  of  camp  life  while\ntrekking, or Maggie\u2019s escape from illness. Such practice offers  pathways  into  understanding  the\nimmediacy of experience and mobilises \u201cnot just a physical setting, but an orientation, a feeling, a\ntendency\u201d (Radley & Taylor:  24).  Visual  practice  can  therefore  launch  moments  that  express\ncorporeal uniqueness as emotions exceed expression in language and  erupt  into  gesture  (Elkins,\n1998;  Mulvey,  1986).  Thus,  for  many  like  Olivia,  photography  aids  comprehension   of   the\nimmersion of self into the landscape: \u201cit just really captures what I am not able to  put  into  words\nsometimes\u201d\u2026\u201cit  was  a  beautiful   view,   the   sunlight...its   utter   silence\u2026\u201d   (see   figure   9).\nExperiences are no longer reducible to representation, but embrace bodily engagements that are re-\nvivified in the act of photography (Harrison, 2000) as tourists strive to make sense of, prolong and\npreserve the immediacy of moment: \u201cI just thought, \u2018wow I am up here\u2019\u2026this  is  mine  because  I\nam here and I can see it, wow\u2019\u2026I feel I have got to take it\u201d (Paula).\nFigure 9: The Peruvian Altiplano, Respondent\nEmbodied visualities  also  emerge  as  tourists  (re)encounter  photographs  they,  or  others,  have\ntaken. As Sontag (1979) suggests, \u201cthe ultimate wisdom of the (photograph)\u2026is  to  say:  there  is\nthe surface. Now\u2026feel, intuit \u2013 what is beyond it\u201d (:  23).  In  encountering  photographs,  tourists\ncan  be  transported  optically,  their  bodies  remaining  immobile  as  pleasure   arises   from   the\nexperience of the simulacrum (Krauss, 1982). Barthes\u2019 (1981)  concept  of  studium  and  punctum\nallows us to explore such practice further.  He  suggests  the  studium  presents  the  photographers\nintention; mobilising half-desires and creating general enthusiasm. Indeed, it  is  the  studium  that\nenables some to trigger initial imagined  practices:  \u201cI  mean  its\u2026what\u2019s  here,  or  what\u2019s  behind\nyou?...you can imagine yourself standing on this spot and taking that photo yourself\u201d (Peter).\nHowever, through the shock of referentiality, the punctum is the  element  of  the  photograph  that\n\u2018pricks\u2019  tourists\u2019  subjectivity.  It  brings  poignancy  and  the  power  of  expansion  by  capturing\nattention and heightening intrigue. It is tourists\u2019 personal addition to photographs.  While  Barthes\nproposes a redundancy of the image in such practice, I propose photographs continue to  stimulate\naffiliations that  influence  tourists\u2019  practice.  Thus,  photographs  become  reference  points  from\nwhich  tourists  can  reignite  imaginings  via  reflexive  embodied  performance.   Drawing   upon\nPhelan\u2019s (1997) notion of the \u201cvanishing point\u201d, tourists re-enliven place as they  are  sucked  into\nthe body of the image and ignite that which photographs cannot show and corporeal vision  cannot\nsee. The interior of the photograph opens through the \u2018as if\u2019 as tourists \u201cpenetrate its interiority\u201d to\nsense what the  subject  feels  like  (:  35).  For  Cathy  and  Jim,  figure  10  \u201calways  brings  some\nmusic\u2026the accordion and the band and the trumpeter really giving it beans\u201d. Senses and emotions\ntake over as some become orally illiterate but sensually alive.\nFigure 10: Music, Respondents\u2019 Photograph            Figure 11: Children at a rest stop, Authors own\n                                                                                                      collection\nFinally, photographs are ethical prompts. Mirroring the inherent multiplicity  of  visual  practices\nin tourism, Thrift (2004) suggests no absolute  ethical  truth  exists.  Rather,  we  practice  through\n\u201cmanyness\u201d as ethics should not exist to vacuum up difference. Ethics are not clear-cut binaries of\nright\/wrong, good\/bad as outlined in identity politics of moralistic geographies.  Indeed,  to  attend\nsolely to the collective denies the plurality and potential instability and unpredictability  of  ethical\nopinion. Yet, as Cloke (2004) suggests, space  exists  for  guiding  principles:  a  series  of  anchor\npoints that facilitate conformity while generating sensitivity of and  for  other.  As  such,  ethics  in\nvisual practice demands an emotional and committed sense of other  to  ensure  responsiveness  to\nthe complexity of human plurality.\nFirst, photographs and photography are inherently imbued in a wealth  of  practices  of  searching,\nexposing,   constructing   and   staging   subjects   as    appearances    are    fixed    and    situations\nchoreographed. Visual practice therefore mobilises an intense visibility of the subject (Pollard  cit.\nKinsman, 1995). Such selectivity creates an ethics of skill and expertise that questions  who  holds\nauthority as to what is (not) desirable. Thus, photography becomes inherently selfish; emphasising\nor  restricting  visibility  to  satisfy  ideological  purpose.  However,  such  ethical   negotiation   in\npractice is  not  uniform.  Rather,  I  propose  the  dynamic,  fluid  nature  of  ethical  consideration\nstimulates a profound confusion of ethics  and  ethical  confusion.  Photographs  and  photography\nemerge as a complex fusion of both predictable and reactionary practices that align general ethical\nviewpoints with unpredictable ethical response in the  immediacy  of  moment  of  photographing.\nFor example, Abby expressed that she \u201cwould never take a photo unless I\u2019ve asked them first  and\nif they said no, I wouldn\u2019t do it\u201d. Alternatively some, like Les, react in the moment as he sought to\npreserve the effect of his encounter with child in figure 4. Indeed, during my visit to  the  Peruvian\nAltiplano,  tourists  wandered  around  stalls  at  a  rest-stop  where   several   children   played   in\ntraditional  dress  (see   figure   11).   Some   asked   directly   if   they   could   photograph,   some\nphotographed from a distance, while others perused the stalls before approaching  for  permission.\nSome children struck well-rehearsed poses and looked straight at the camera while others shuffled\ntheir feet, looking at the ground. Both tourists and children engaged in an awkward performance.\nSuch confusion  of  ethics  creates  fragility  in  photographing.  To  understand  such  negotiations\nfurther, Barthes\u2019 (1981) \u2018violence of photography\u2019, can be reconsidered as a  \u2018violence  of  ethics\u2019.\nEach  performance   commands   attention,   forcing   tourists   to   confront   a   range   of   ethical\nconsideration.  Positioning  is  not  always  immediate  or  comfortable  as   subjective   difference\ndemands a spectrum of responses to negotiation and where some  experience  extreme  discomfort\nand unease, others experience comfort in practice.\nESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK OF VISUALITY\nHaving outlined  the  theoretical  conceptualisations  of  visuals  and  visual  practice  as:  political\nartefacts,  reflexive  performance,  the  imagination  of  space,  embodied  visualities   and   ethical\nprompts,  attention  now  turns  to  the  diversity  practices  and  processes   through   which   such\nconceptualisations are realised at a range of temporal and  spatial  intensities  throughout  tourists\u2019\nexperience. I propose a framework of visuality comprised of key visual  \u2018moments\u2019  and  \u2018devices\u2019\n(see figure  12).  Tourists  face  a  proliferation  of  visual  artefacts  from  brochures,  guidebooks,\npostcards and pamphlets to photographs from  their  own  collections  or  those  of  friends\/family.\nWhile, it is impossible to include the  entire  spectrum,  I  identify  three  \u2018classic\u2019  visual  devices:\ntourist  brochures,  picture  postcards  and  tourists\u2019  own   photographs.   Though   delineated   for\nanalysis, these are not contained entities that operate in isolation. Rather, they  emerge  at  varying\nintensities throughout the tourist experience. Secondly, I  propose  practices  emerge  during  three\nkey \u2018moments\u2019. These are identified  as:  anticipation,  rewriting  and  remembrance  and  reliving.\nReflecting the dynamic nature tourists\u2019 experiences, moments are not mutually  exclusive,  nor  do\nthey  assume  a   linear   process   through   which   tourists   pass.   Rather,   they   are   essentially\ninterdependent and  offer  a  multidimensional  approach  to  understanding  tourists\u2019  experiences.\nNevertheless,  it  is  inevitable  that  some   practices   are   more   pertinent   to   some   theoretical\nconceptualisations, \u2018moments\u2019 and \u2018devices\u2019 than others.\nFigure 12:  A Framework of Visuality for Visual Practice\nThe Moment of Anticipation\nPast research (see Urry, 1990; Selwyn, 1996) advocates the highly visual nature of anticipation  as\na series of highly skewed place perceptions created and mobilised by industry (e.g. tour operators,\ntourist boards, etc). Thus, tourists absorb mediated ways of seeing and engage in day-dreaming  or\n\u201cmind travel\u201d (L\u00f6fgren, 1999) via that which is  seen.  Yet,  such  understanding  fails  to  address\ntransitional spaces of visualities: the practices and processes that enable the material objectivity of\ndestinations  to  transcend  their  physical  boundaries   (Franklin   &   Crang,   2001).    Indeed,   a\nmultiplicity of visual and non-visual practices permeate visual  devices  as  anticipation  embraces\nnot only that which is seen, but which is performed via political, embodied, ethical,  reflexive  and\nimaginative encounter. Such performances are neither uniform, nor are  they  entirely  predictable.\nRather, anticipation emerges as complex  relations  of  guiding,  projecting  and  repositioning  via\ncreative, fluid practices that are mobilised by both producers and tourists.\nAt this point it is necessary to distinguish between the practices  employed  industry  and  tourists.\nFirst, I attend to the practices of tour operators. As political artefacts, brochure images  emerge  as\nrepresentations of space that abstract destinations  according  to  recognisable  icons.  Photographs\nare  inherently  politically  situated  within  prescribed  narratives  that  are  enforced  through   the\nconscious selection of subjects. Photographs therefore expose the interests they serve (Ateljevic &\nDoorne, 2000). Working to stage a destination and mobilise a directed gaze, tour operators \u201chook\u201d\ntourists by presenting  that  which  is  already  known  (Brian).  Echoing  all  tour  operators,  Julia\ncommented: \u201cMachu Picchu definitely\u2026.that is why  most  people  want  to  go\u201d.  The  ubiquitous\nMachu Picchu is coupled with key icons of colourfully dressed, friendly people, the jungle, llamas\nand Inca  ruins  as  destinations  are  choreographed  according  to  collective  understandings  and\nmediated place narratives.  Yet,  despite  frustrations  of  being  confined  to  dominant  narratives,\nintervention infiltrates practice as tour operators  like  Ewan  parallel  generality  with  specificity:\n\u201cMachu Picchu, the people the colourful markets\u2026then this is the fun  way  to  do  it,  come  with\nus\u201d. Thus, visual practices not only  serve  to  reinforce  tourists\u2019  perceptions,  but  gently  expand\nimaginary horizons as tour operators introduce and mediate previously \u2018hidden\u2019 elements of  place\nand directly infer their active role in providing the desired experience.\nDuring anticipation, visuals become  sites  of  struggle  that  are  produced  as  ethically  mobilised\nspaces  of  encounter.  Production  concentrates  on  \u201cshowcasing\u201d  (Jane)  destinations;   initiating\ncuriosities, capturing the  \u2018feel\u2019  of  destinations  and  convincing  tourists  destinations  are  worth\nvisiting.  Thus,  discourses  are  simultaneously  controlled,  selected   and   redistributed   as   tour\noperators mediate the conditions under which photographed subjects are  presented.  Enmeshed  in\ndiscursive interpretations of responsibility and (mis)representation, visuals emerge as a balance  of\nwhite lies and honesty. As Frasier surmised: \u201copenness and  honesty\u2026is  very  important\u2026do  we\ntell porkies?  Yep,  all  the  time  (laughs),  it\u2019s  in  my  job  description\u201d.  Yet,  moral  and  ethical\ndilemma underpins the construction of desired truths  as  tour  operators  engage  in  \u201cbending  the\ntruth\u201d  (Tom).  Temporary  or  transitional  place  elements  are   routinely   open   to   negotiation.\nAddressing delicate, political  discourses,  some  like  Fraser,  actively  distance  themselves  from\n\u201csomething that  represents  the  sheer  poverty,  the  sheer  deprivation\u201d,  while  others  like  Lucy\nreassure tourists of their safety by diverting attention from  crime  and  drugs.  Yet,  bound  by  the\nlegalities of due diligence, limits exist to the number of  \u2018white  lies\u2019  that  can  be  told  as  \u201cif  the\ndream doesn\u2019t match the reality, you get some very unhappy customers\u201d (Leonard).\nFinally, tour operators provide opportunity for  reflexive  performance,  embodied  visualities  and\nimaginations  of  space  as  they  socio-spatialise  place;  giving  place  character   and   enlivening\ndestinations according to preferred discourse. Thus, tour operators present potential  performances\nas already practised. Stages are set and roles cast as tour operators mobilise pathways of  personal\nengagement  that  entice  tourists  to  become  \u201cimagined  actors\u201d  (Scarles,   2004).   Tourists   are\nencouraged  to  \u2018step  into\u2019  destinations  via  the   \u201c3D-effect\u201d   (Carol)   that   deepens   embodied\nperformance of imagined practice. As Tom said, \u201cthey can almost smell the place\u2026almost hear it,\nfeel it, touch it, the whole thing.  That\u2019s  the  point\u201d.  Visuals  facilitate  the  creation  of  intimacy,\nallowing both place  and  tourists  to  transcend  their  physical  boundaries  and  enliven  potential\nexperiences.  Connections  are  stimulated   as   tour   operators   actively   audience   destinations;\npresenting idealised ages, characteristics and environments \u201cto  give  an  idea  of  what  the  whole\nexperience will be like\u201d (Kate). Thus, visuals simultaneously ground anticipations in a reality that-\nhas-been while encouraging tourists to actively  \u2018step  into\u2019  encounters  that-may-be  by  showing\n\u201cpeople on their holiday\u2026real, out there having fun\u201d (Ewan) (see figure 8).\nLike tour operators, tourists actively engage in the politicisation of place.  They  are  not  na\u00efve  to\ntour operators\u2019 primary goal of  selling  via  \u201ctourified\u201d  (Les)  collective  discourse.  Rather,  they\nbecome players in the game of directed viewing. Anticipation extends  beyond  the  reach  of  pure\nhedonistic pleasure-seeking as feelings of pleasure and excitement  are  paralleled  with  insecurity\nand doubt. While some like Angela are \u201cquite happy just to wait and  see\u201d,  many  like  Cathy  and\nPeter continue to express concerns regarding  \u2018hidden\u2019  elements  such  as  political  unrest,  health\nissues, poverty and  crime.  Visual  practice  therefore  results  in  spaces  of  uncertainty  and  \u2018not\nknowing\u2019 as tourists piece together mosaics of partial knowledges of  intersubjective  negotiations\nto understand what may occur.\nSecondly, conceptualisations of the imagination of space,  reflexive  performances  and  embodied\nvisualities emerge  in  anticipatory  practice.  The  subjectivity  of  reflexive  performance  enables\ntourists to  make  sense  of  potential  encounters  via  a  fusion  of  collective  discourse,  personal\ninterests and past experiences. For  example,  in  anticipating  Machu  Picchu,  Paula  commented:\n\u201cit\u2019s like when we were in Australia\u2026my sisters went to\u2026Ayers  Rock\u2026and\u2026said  it  was\u2026just\nso  wonderful  to  be  in  it\u2026and  I  guess  that  is  how  we  are  about  that\u201d.  Indeed,   while   few\nrespondents consciously  engage  in  prolonged  reflexive  imaginings,  many  experience  fleeting\nmoments of \u2018stepping into\u2019 place. For example, looking at figure 8, Sarah said: \u201cshe is  looking  at\nthe  person  taking  the  photograph\u2026shes  looking  back  at  you,  so  you   are   now   taking   the\nphotograph\u2026you are right in  there\u201d.  Thus,  tourists  actively  enliven  destinations  via  imagined\nembodied practices.  However,  the  prospect  of  disappointment  and  the  desire  to  preserve  the\nintensity of the  immediacy  of  experience  generates  a  deferment  of  such  practice.  Many  like\nGillian, actively avoid prolonged immersion into mediated discourses as  \u201cthat  is  someone  else\u2019s\nholiday\u2026I  want  to\u2026give  myself  a  clean  slate  so   that   I   don\u2019t   have   huge   expectations\u201d.\nNevertheless, visuals also mobilise a series of non-visual practices  as  respondents  are  alerted  to\nkey details that trigger \u2018real  time\u2019  preparation.  Prompted  by  the  like-minded  tourists  pictured,\nsome like Gillian  and  Maggie  are  motivated  to  go  to  the  gym,  others  like  Sarah  and  Paula\npurchase appropriate clothing, or like Martin, refamiliarise themselves with the  Spanish  language\nas they anticipate engagement with local people. Anticipation therefore emerges via diverse visual\nand non-visual practices as tourists embark on  a  \u2018getting-to-know-you\u201d  process  and  initiate  the\nfusion of self and other.\nThe Moment of Rewriting\nIn the second moment of rewriting, attention shifts both towards practice as a fusion of  imagined\nand experiential encounter and to postcards and tourists\u2019 own photographs as the  devices  through\nwhich practices are primarily performed. By rewriting, I do not propose photography as  merely  a\nhunter-gatherer  activity  of  voyeuristic  participation  (Sontag,  1979).  Rather,  as  tourists  move\nthrough place collective discourses merge with subjective experiential  encounters  that  unfold  as\nnot only prescribed and anticipated  but,  immanent  and  personalised.  Thus,  rewriting  embraces\nphotographs and photography as a series of dynamic and  active  practices  as  tourists  respond  to\nand accommodate destinations as they continually unfold through experiential encounter.\nFigures 13 & 14 (left to right): Low Zone of Machu Picchu seen from the Templo of las Tres Ventanas,  Tierre  Firme\nEdiciones; Terraces in the Agricultural Sector of Machu Picchu, Tierre Firme Ediciones.\nAs with anticipation, it is necessary to distinguish between industry and  tourist  practices.  Rather\nthan a distinct rewriting of place, practices of postcard production mirror that or tour  operators  as\nthey politicise discursive spaces according  to  desired  narratives.  As  Juan  said:  \u201cyou  have  the\nchildren  with  the  llamas  and  the  girls  with  traditional  dresses\u2026(postcards)  show  the   place\n(tourists) want to see\u201d. Likewise, political and ethical consideration emerges as postcards  provide\nopportunity for producers  to  gently  extend  the  tourist  imagination:  \u201cyou  have  to  show  what\ntourists are  buying  but  we  also\u2026incorporate  other  things  so...they\u2026learn  a  bit  more  of  our\ncountry\u201d  (Ursula).  Thus,  postcards  producers  encourage   tourists   to   explore   beyond   icons:\nintroducing new angles or  local  and  regional  characteristics  that  remain  beyond  the  reach  of\nbrochures (see figures  13  &  14).  While  such  practice  parallels  that  of  tour  operators,  place-\nspecificity arises as producers enframe place to support deeper narratives of economic, social  and\npolitical stability. Adopting an ambassadorial role, politicisation arises as  many  use  postcards  to\npromote the tourist image of Peru. As George surmised: \u201c(we) do not reproduce  poverty\u2026a  poor\nchild crying in the street\u2026tourists don\u2019t come here to see poverty\u201d\u2026\u201cwe  want  to  show  that  the\nhorrific time of terrorism have been erased\u2026.that nowadays our country is completely  quiet,  you\ncan find some places\u2026to walk  around  with  no  problem  at  all\u201d.  Indeed,  while  some  embrace\nalternative narratives and expose deeper  political  insights  into  the  lives  of  other,  the  majority\nreinforce a synthesis of \u201cother that is the same\u201d (Cloke, 2004) as postcards  offer  a  mediated  and\naestheticised encounter with place.\nOn arrival tourists are inevitably bound to anticipatory imaginings and many  respondents  express\ndesire to use photographs and photography to  capture  key  icons.  Icons  such  as  Machu  Picchu\nremain a key priority: \u201cI wanted to take some  photos  of  Machu  Picchu  because  I  had  seen  so\nmany photos\u2026and it looked exactly like I thought it was going to\u201d (Abby).  Thus,  photographing\nconcretises experience and confirms the existence of anticipated  place  characteristics.  Yet,  such\npractices produce highly politicised sites of struggle as anticipatory imaginings become  infiltrated\nand obscured by  the  immanent  and  unfolding  realities  of  place.  Visual  practice  can  become\nfuelled by frustration as gaps emerge between desired and actual images: \u201cI went to Peru trying  to\nget\u2026the kids\u2026(but) it just never felt right, the backdrop wasn\u2019t right, or what they  were  wearing\nwasn\u2019t right, or  they  weren\u2019t  pretty  enough\u201d  (Angela).  Therefore,  rewriting  arises  as  tourists\nselectively produce place.  (Not)  photographing  or  buying  postcards  allows  tourists  to  bestow\nvisibility on more desirable experiences that convey  the  impression  of  the  existence  of  desired\nimaginings and encounters. Such is  the  power  of  reproducing  the  collective  gaze  that  tourists\nenunciate institutionalised roles (Edensor, 1998); taking \u2018duty\u2019 photographs; succumbing  to  tour-\nguided photography, or experiencing pressure to photograph from fellow tourists. As Martin  said:\n\u201cyou feel that some places you are supposed to take\u201d\u2026\u201cI do feel a bit of pressure\u2026particularly  if\nyou have just got somewhere\u2026if other people have  got  theirs  (cameras)  and  they  are  taking  a\nphoto and you are \u2018oh, I had better, hadn\u2019t I?\u2019\u201d.\nHowever, the complexities  of  visual  practice  deepen  as  anticipatory  imaginings  are  rewritten\nthrough  experiential   encounter.   At   this   moment,   political   and   ethical   considerations   of\nphotographing come to the fore as tourists move beyond enclavic, themed environments (Edensor,\n1998). Visual devices, in particular tourists\u2019 own photography,  mobilise  a  \u2018getting-to-know-you\u2019\nprocess as tourists initiate their own contact spaces with place. Photography emerges as a series of\nactive performances as tourists understanding and encounters of  place  move  from  the  realm  of\nimagination  into  experiential  encounter.  Place  becomes  infused  with  subjectivity  as   tourists\nactively situate their physical self alongside other.  In  doing  so,  they  photographically  construct\nplaces  and  experiences  according  to  intersubjective   encounter.   Such   practice   ranges   from\nabsorbing inferences of everyday life, for example, Peter\u2019s experience of the  Uros  Islands  where\n\u201cthe people were out cutting the reed\u2026you know, taking pictures of people  about  their  everyday\nlife\u201d, to understanding the effects of relative poverty as Alison photographed \u201cthe school  building\nand the little children\u2026they walk one and  a  half  to  two  hours  to  get  to  school  everyday  and\n\u2026back  again  at  night\u2026.there  are  people  still  living\u2026in  those  sorts   of   circumstances\u201d.   In\nencountering place and opening new \u201ccontact spaces\u201d (Cloke, 2004), tourists  face  a  \u2018violence  of\nphotography\u2019 as they simultaneously consume and produce place  through  photographic  practice.\nPlaces are negotiated via a fusion of intersubjective encounters as both imagined and  experienced\nas tourists actively compose and construct the subjects and context within which they photograph.\nFinally, rewriting becomes immersed in embodied visualities as tourists use their entire  bodies  to\nexpress  the  range  of  their  experience:  the  excitement,  fascination,   boredom   or   even   fear.\nPhotography  becomes  infused  with  personal   geographies   of   emotions   as   it   is   bound   in\nconstructing  the  event  as  concrete  bodily  performances  and  tangible  memories  (Haldrup   &\nLarsen, 2004). Importance lies in the feelings, moods and sensations tourists experience as \u201ctaking\na photograph isn\u2019t just about capturing the image, it\u2019s  about  capturing\u2026a  feeling\u201d  (Brian).  The\nbody becomes committed to the photograph as respondents, experienced an emotional and sensual\nintensity of  being  in  place.  Photographing  provides  structure  and  opportunity  to  capture  the\nessence of self that transcends words and moves action into  kinaesthetic  sense  and  flow  (Thrift,\n1999). It concretises affectual connections between self and other that exist as moments of intense\nsubjective  reflection  in   corporeal\/incorporeal   union.   Whether   sudden,   abrupt,   fleeting   or\nprolonged, such sensations of belonging envelope respondents\u2019 entirely as they are no longer  only\ndriven by what is seen or by the actions of others, but by deep-rooted desire to \u2018get that  photo\u2019  or\n\u2018capture  that  feeling\u2019.   Whether   acting   immediately,   or   waiting   to   become   absorbed   by\natmospheres and emotions, photographing, as Olivia said: \u201cjust really captures what I am not  able\nto put into words\u201d. Yet,  photographing  is  not  solely  practised  during  pleasant  encounters  like\nSarah\u2019s experience of the porters\u2019 laughter. It also offered isolation  when  Maggie  suffered  from\naltitude  sickness,  or  distracted  Abby  from  the  pain  in  her  feet  as  she  trekked.  Yet,  despite\ncompulsion to photograph, for some photography erodes the intensity of embodied connectedness.\nWhile, some seek moments  of  uninterrupted  encounter  and  \u201cdidn\u2019t  want  anything  to  mediate\nbetween you and that experience\u201d, as Harrison (2000) suggests, for  others  photography  provides\nan opportunity to embrace and re-vivify bodily engagements with place.\nThe Moment of Remembrance and Reliving\nIn the final moment of remembrance and reliving, both  tour  operators  and  postcard  producers\noccupy a less prominent role as tourists\u2019 emerge as primary producers of memories  and  reflexive\nperformance.  Nevertheless,  postcards  become  souvenirs  that  offer  a  \u201cremembrance\u2026of   that\nplace\u201d (Ursula); a series of stages as tourists become pseudo-authors and selectively stage place as\ntheir own. Yet, while postcards capture that which tourists cannot,  their  ultimate  failure  is  their\ninability to secure  the  intense  affectual  connection  to  place  that  exists  at  the  core  of  tourist\nphotography. As Sharon said: \u201cI do think of postcards as not being my  own\u2026(I)  could  have  got\nthat  image  from  anywhere  whereas  your  own  photos  are  you  and   that   moment   in   time\u201d.\nTherefore, the reflexive, embodied subjectivities of encounter between self and other  are  integral\nto performance of remembrance and reliving as tourists realise and collect memories  as  corporeal\nencounter through photographic practice (Edensor, 1998). Whether borne through wonder,  shock,\ndisgust, boredom or duty, photographing bridges experiential and reflexive encounters by not only\nconstructing, but aiding and reinforcing memories.\nPhotographs and photography therefore become charged as political artefacts and ethical  prompts\nas tourists become producers and bestow visibility upon  preferred  photographed  subjects  which\nbest reflects their experience. As Angela said: \u201cI can remember what Puno town  looked  like,  but\nit\u2019s not a memory I am particularly bothered about. If  it  did  fade,  then  so  be  it\u201d.  The  inherent\nselfishness of photography emerges respondents actively personalise place.  For  example,  Martin\nphotographed \u201cthe policemen  you  know\u2026leaning  on  their  riot  shields\u2026other  people\u2026would\nwant a photograph of the church but not particularly the policemen\u201d (see figure 15). Such  practice\nelevates the importance of creating connections of self in place and while  some  seek  the  elusive\n\u201cNational Geographic\u201d shot, for many, aesthetic qualities  become  superfluous.  As  Gillian  said:\n\u201ceven though my photographs are not of professional quality, I made them\u2026so it doesn\u2019t matter if\nhalf of my thumb is in it\u201d. Thus, photographs become memorial  sites  (Crang  &  Travlou,  2001).\nThey are not taken in and for themselves, but facilitate the realisation of self in  place  and  extend\nthe moment of encounter into another space and time.\nYet, memories are not simply constructed in-situ  and  transported  into  domestic  spaces.  Rather,\nthey are continually moulded as tourists construct spaces of reencounter on their return home  (see\nRose, 2003; Hirsch, 1981, 1997). Photograph albums, frames, fridges and  noticeboards  and  such\nlike, become platforms for re-enlivening experiences. While some like Peter, leave photographs in\npackets,  for  many,  photograph  albums  become  the  principle  space  of  reencounter.  As  such,\nphotographs become \u201cimagetexts\u201d  (Hirsch,  1997)  as  tourists  create  selective  autobiographical\nreflections of their experiences via ideology-fuelled stories of  place  (Hirsch,  1981,  1997;  Rose,\n2003). Practices of filtering and rejecting emerge as tourists systematically  analyse  their  images;\ncomparing and contrasting as  \u201cthey  may  be  out  of  focus\u2026they  don\u2019t  really  show  the  whole\nbuilding,  \u2026or\u2026we  don\u2019t  want  twenty  photos   of   the   one   place\u201d   (Charlie).   Yet,   despite\nconstructing mediated narratives of experience, some tourists  are  unwilling  to  destroy  even  the\nmost  technically  imperfect  photograph.  Such  is  the  embodied  affiliation  and   connection   to\nexperience, \u2018rejects\u2019 are stored  out  of  sight  and  exist  in  the  space  that  occupies  the  moment\nbetween life through exhibition and death through rejection  as  tourists  are  unwilling  to  divulge\ncontent, yet are reluctant to break bonds entirely. Such practices mobilise \u2018closure\u2019 as  experiences\nare compartmentalised and, for the most part, becomes stored out of sight. Nevertheless, closure is\nnever absolute as many respondents  talk  of  sporadic  reencounters  with  photographs  via  either\nchance or to fulfil a purpose or need (Edensor, 1998).\nFigures 15: Policemen at the Government Palace, Lima.     Figure 16: Cusco Cathedral,\n                     Respondent\u2019s Photograph                                                            Respondent\u2019s Photograph;\nWhether, used  to  make  sense  of  forthcoming  holidays  or  providing  comfort  in  old  age,  the\ntangibility  of  photographs,  as  objects  to  touch,  hold  and  feel  is   fundamental   in   reigniting\nmemories. As Rosie said: \u201cif you weren\u2019t looking at a photo it  wouldn\u2019t\u2026inspire  things  in  your\nbrain\u2026you need that something  to  sort  of  spark  off  a  thought\u201d.  Following  Cloke  &  Pawson\n(forthcoming), photographs therefore become beacons of  memory  that  mobilise  highly  charged\nembodied,  reflexive  performances  that  prompt  tourists\u2019   relocation   as   they   engage   in   the\nimagination of space and \u2018step into\u2019 place and become consumed  once  more  by  that  which  has\nbeen. Reflexive intimacy (Haldrup & Larsen, 2004) opens expressive  freedom  within  the  haptic\nspaces of reflexivity as subjects are enlivened and extends beyond that  which  is  pictured.  Many,\nlike Charlie and Alison recalled experiences that extend beyond  that  which  is  seen.  Looking  at\nfigure 16, they talked of walking \u201cout one night and they  had  a  service  in  there  and  you  could\nwalk inside and on this side there was a great big round  stained  glass  window\u201d.  For  Cathy,  her\nphotographs of the jungle allow her to reignite \u201cthe sound and the smell and the noise\u2026the  whole\nthing\u201d.  Photographs  therefore  allow  tourist  to  reignite  experiences   via   reflexive,   embodied\nperformances.  They  penetrate  the  interiority  of  the  visual  and  once  again  bring  life  to   the\nphotographed subject.\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of photography within  such  practice.\nFor many, the failure of photography exists in its inability to capture  and  preserve  the  embodied\nintensity of encounters. They expressed frustration that even personal photographs of sites such as\nMachu Picchu did not \u2018cut it\u2019. Thus, despite photographing the site, the demands of the  collective\ngaze restrict the intensity of reflexive engagement. As Angela said: \u201cI think you need  to  be  there\nbecause\u2026these photographs are no different to anybody else\u2019s\u201d.\nSuch  limitations  of  reflexive  performance  through   photography   bring   me   to   practices   of\nmemorialisation. While photographs provide a means through which tourists  are  able  to  directly\nreconnect and reignite deep affectual affiliation to place, an inevitable fluidity and malleability  of\nmemory arises. The radial nature of memory creates a continual morphing and fading of memories\nas new knowledges mobilise changes in perceptions of self and other. As  Gillis  (1994)  suggests,\nmemories are called upon to serve purpose and exist as a series of fluid resurrections that generate\nmemoryscapes  of  encounter.  Thus,  intricate  details  become  eroded   in   favour   of   dominant\nremembrances  as  place  is  sporadically  reconstructed  through  relational  encounters  (Cloke  &\nPawson, forthcoming). Such deviation does not deny the intensity of the original encounter, but as\nJohnson (1999) suggests, modern memories  replace  \u2018true\u2019  memories  of  experience  as  original\nencounters are increasingly translated via popular, collective narratives.\nLikewise, temporal and spatial distanciation fuels the creation of alternative memories  as  tourists\nincreasingly recall experiences as imaged  (Bal,  2000;  Travlou,  2002).  As  Martin  surmised:  \u201cI\nknow that my memory will fade\u2026and I will increasingly see my  holiday  through  this  brochure,\nthrough this album\u201d. Thus, photographs become short-hand remembrances of experience  (Cohen,\n1985); \u201ccondensation sites\u201d (Edensor, 1998) of experiences that have been. They hold power  over\npractices of memory construction (Markwick, 1997) as remembrances gradually  narrow  in  focus\nuntil they are potentially eroded of detail beyond that which is displayed in albums.  Indeed,  even\nthe intensity of affectual connections that maintain the bond between  tourist  and  place  gradually\nfall foul to the depths of memory as \u201ca few years down the line you  can  look  back  and\u2026remind\nyourself  of  that  experience\u2026probably  more  like  how  you  explained  it  to  them  (family  and\nfriends)\u201d (Cathy).\nCONCLUSIONS\nInfluenced by recent developments in understanding tourism and  what  it  is  to  be  a  tourist,  my\nconcern has been to unpack the diversity of  practices  through  which  photographs  both  produce\nand are produced by tourists. Moving beyond ideas of tourism as a series of predetermined, linear,\nstatic stages through which we pass, I  have  drawn  upon  work  by  authors  such  as  Franklin  &\nCrang (2001) and  Coleman  &  Crang  (2002)  to  highlight  tourism  as  a  process  of  becoming;\nembracing difference through a complex multiplicity of fluid, dynamic and  continually  unfolding\npractices and performances. I have argued that photographs and photography  are  fundamental  to\nthis  process  as  they  infiltrate  the  entire  tourist  experience.  They  \u2018light   up\u2019   and   invigorate\nbecoming as they are produced and consumed as active, lived encounters with place; instilling life\nand mobilising deeper affiliations between self and other through a  series  of  both  imagined  and\nexperiential encounters. \nI have sought to unpack the theoretical complexities of photographs and photographic practice  by\nestablishing  a  conceptual  framework  of  photography.  In  doing  so,  five  key   moments   have\nemerged that provide the foundation for exploring tourists\u2019 renegotiation of self and other  as  they\nmove through place via  a  series  of  imagined  and  experiential  practices.  Embracing  issues  of\npolitics, space, agency, embodiment and ethics, the  moments  identify  photography  as:  political\nartefacts, reflexive  performances,  the  imagination  of  space,  embodied  visualities  and  finally,\nethical prompts. Such conceptualisations  expose  the  intersubjective  nature  of  photographs  and\nphotography as practices through which respondents perform place are understood as  a  fusion  of\ncollective and individual  discursive  transformations.  Thus,  tourists  enliven  and  perform  place\nthrough photographs and photography as they emerge as  a  series  of  both  staged  and  imminent\nperformances.  Indeed,  photographs  and  photography  are  not  a  means  to  an  end.  Rather,  as\nopportunities for exploration and discovery, accommodation and understanding,  they  are  wholly\nimmersed in a dynamic triangulation of the tourist  experience  as  constructed  via  intersubjective\nnegotiations between third-party producers (in this case  tour  operators  and  postcard  producers),\ntourists and photographed subjects.\nMirroring the fluidity of the tourist experience, I have  proposed  that  such  conceptualisations  of\nphotographs  and  photography  are  not  bound  to  static,  isolated   moments   of   production   or\nconsumption,  but  emerge  at  varying  temporal  and  spatial  intensities  through  a  diversity   of\npractices as tourists move in and through place. To understand the complexities of such  practices,\na dynamic framework of visuality that identifies three main visual moments and devices has  been\nestablished. Focusing particularly on brochures, postcards  and  tourists  own  photographs,  visual\ndevices offer pathways  into,  around  and  through  destinations.  They  become  vehicles  through\nwhich  the  performative  spaces  of  tourism  are  activated  and  place  is  created,  enlivened  and\n(re)enacted.  While,  devices  are   generally   situated   within   particular   moments   of   tourists\u2019\nexperiences (for example brochures are called upon primarily for anticipatory  purposes),  I  argue\nthat they are never mutually exclusive, but operate across permeable and blurred boundaries. They\ncross-over and merge at varying temporal and spatial intensities and it such mobility gives  life  to\nthe  tourist  experience  as  tourists  gather  insights  and  experiences  of  place  via   an   array   of\nintersubjective  exchanges.  Such  fluidity   is   echoed   in   the   visual   moments   within   which\nphotographs and photography are situated. The moments of anticipation,  rewriting,  remembrance\nand reliving are inherently non-linear. They embrace becoming as a complex process that  extends\nbeyond divisible boundaries of  the  before,  during  and  after  travel  experiences.  Each  moment\ninfiltrates the others in an essentially fluid and interdependent fusion that denies  the  existence  of\ndistinct spaces of becoming. Devices and moments \u2018light  up\u2019  the  tourist  experience  as  meld  as\ntourists both produce  and  are  produced  by  photographs  and  photography  via  an  amalgam  of\ndiverse practices. The result  is  a  complex,  fluid,  ever-changing  and  evolving  triangulation  of\nrelations between producers, tourists and  place,  as  each  ceaselessly  become  within  the  tourist\nexperience.\nREFERENCES\nAdler, J.
