The WTO counts more than 250 regional trade arrangements, \nover half of them signed in the last ten years.1 Recently, Japan has joined the bandwagon. \nAfter adhering to a multilateralist trade policy for over four decades, it concluded its first \nbilateral free trade agreements (FTAs): the Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership \nAgreement (JSEPA), signed in January 2003, followed by the Japan-Mexico FTA in \nSeptember 2004 and a \u2018basic accord\u2019 with the Philippines in November 2004. \nNegotiations with South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia are underway. The decision to \npursue preferential agreements for trade and investment, intensely contested \ndomestically, represents a sea change for Japanese trade policy. \nJapan\u2019s policy shift is puzzling for several reasons. Scholars have argued that \ncountries seek FTAs to protect export markets when other countries are concluding \npreferential agreements, especially when multilateral negotiations are stalled (Mansfield \nand Reinhardt, 2003; Zissimos and Vines, 2000). Yet as markets, countries like Thailand \nand Mexico are of minor importance, with a respective share of four and one per cent of \ntotal Japanese exports.2 Even if the argument of a stalled WTO holds, these countries \ncannot supplant the US, EU, China and Taiwan that buy 80 per cent of Japanese \nmerchandise exports. \n2 \n  \nThe small size of partner economies also casts doubt on potential welfare gains, a \nsecond argument made to explain the popularity of FTAs (Baier and Bergstrand, 2004). \nUrata and Kiyota (2003) use a computable general equilibrium model to estimate the \neffects of a regional FTA encompassing Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and \nASEAN (excluding Brunei and Myanmar) on national income and trade patterns. Yet \neven their most optimistic scenario predicts an added GDP growth of only 0.05 per cent \nfor Japan. \nJapanese government officials offer a third rationale for FTAs: to boost the \nliberalization of the protected agricultural sector in Japan.3 In the two existing \nagreements, however, agriculture was mostly excluded. Indeed, some observers now \nacknowledge that agricultural reform is a precondition and not a reason for FTAs \n(Hatakeyama, 2003a; Yamashita, 2004).  \nSo why did Japan begin to seek bilateral agreements in recent years? This article \nargues that Japan\u2019s pursuit of FTAs is representative of a broad trend in international \neconomic relations: it reflects the growing importance of foreign direct investment (FDI) \nand the sharing of production across borders. FDI changes the incentives for states \nregarding preferential trade agreements, motivating them to pursue bilateral options in \naddition to multilateral negotiations.  Yet, with the increasing internationalization of \nproduction, bilateral agreements also threaten to discriminate against firms from third \nparties, motivating them to lobby for defensive agreements. According to the argument \nadvanced in this article, Japanese firms with vertically integrated operations in the host \ncountry emerge as key supporters of FTAs, in particular when their profits are under \nthreat from FTAs signed by other countries. \n3 \n  \nIn this sense, the explanation given in this paper also differs from recent accounts \nof the Japanese FTA policy that attribute most of the initiative to Japanese trade \nbureaucrats (Krauss, 2003; Ogita, 2003). Trade bureaucrats did matter, I argue, but \nprimarily when responding to pressure from interest groups, especially Japanese firms \nwith overseas investment. The logic of this argument is illustrated with two case studies: \nthe Japan-Mexico FTA, a defensive reaction against NAFTA, and the Japanese initiative \nfor an FTA with Thailand, a proactive measure. \nFor two reasons, the Japanese FTA initiatives are challenging cases for the \nargument. First, compared to the US and European countries, Japan lags in the central \nmeasure of international production-sharing: vertical intra-industry trade,4 or trade in \nsimilar goods of different levels of capital-intensity, with regional trade partners (Fukao, \net al., 2003). Second, Japan has a notoriously strong agricultural lobby (George Mulgan, \n1999) that should make bilateral agreements with developing countries particularly \ndifficult to achieve. If it can be shown that despite these counteracting factors, lobbying \nby these Japanese firms was crucial in motivating Japanese policymakers to pursue FTA, \nthen this offers strong support for the central claim of this study. \nThe aim is not to provide a fully-fledged alternative to existing theories of \nregionalism. Governments conclude trade agreements for various political reasons, most \nimportantly to support allies (Gowa and Mansfield, 1993; Gowa, 1995). Any FTA, \nhowever, will have distributive effects with implications for domestic interest groups, \nwho either support or oppose such deals.  I seek to demonstrate that a theory remains \nincomplete if it does not take the political interests into account that emerge with the \nincreasing importance of FDI. Other factors, such as slow progress in the GATT\/WTO \n4 \n  \nand weak regional institutions may have contributed to a change in Japanese trade policy, \nas argued by Ravenhill (2003), but since they were as valid in the early 1990s as now, \nthey offer little insight into why Japanese policy changed only recently. To provide \nevidence for this interpretation, this study analyses the sequence of events through \nprocess-tracing, (King, et al., 1994: 85-7, 225-28) based on interviews with policymakers \nin government and industry, newspaper articles, and secondary sources. \nThe article is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of \nJapan\u2019s trade policy initiatives in the Asia Pacific since 1989. Section three examines \nexisting theories of regionalism in the field of International Political Economy and finds \nthat they cannot fully account for the Japanese case. An alternative view is offered in \nsection four. Section five analyzes the effects of NAFTA that led Japanese policymakers \nto consider FTAs; section six the initiative for an FTA with Thailand and the possibility \nof a competition with China. Section seven concludes. \n \nFrom APEC to Economic Partnership Agreements \n \nDuring most of the 1990s, Japan\u2019s regional trade policy initiatives were limited to \nthe Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), an intergovernmental forum intended to \nliberalize trade and investment around the Pacific Rim. Originating in an initiative of the \nMinistry of International Trade and Industry,5 Australia put forth the official proposal \n(Berger, 1999; Ravenhill, 1998). While the forum received considerable political and \nscholarly attention (Beeson and Jayasuriya, 1998; English, 1999; Gallant and Stubbs, \n1997; Ravenhill, 2000; Terada, 1998), its weak legalization (Kahler, 2000) and lack of \n5 \n  \ncredible commitment mechanisms made trade and investment liberalization difficult to \nachieve. Although the 1994 APEC summit in Bogor declared the goals of free trade in the \nregion by 2010 for developed and 2020 for developing countries, the proposed unilateral \nliberalization skirted domestically sensitive sectors. In consequence, the 1994 \u2018Individual \nAction Plans\u2019 and the 1997 initiative for an \u2018early voluntary sector liberalization\u2019 (EVSL) \nfoundered on a divergence of interests: under domestic pressure, the Japanese \ngovernment was unable to commit to an opening of its agricultural market, while the US \ninsisted on reciprocal concessions (Ravenhill, 2000). \nAs the \u2018altruistic liberalization\u20196 within APEC failed, other countries around the \nPacific Rim began to sign formal free trade agreements. In response, by 1998, both the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and MITI began to study regional trade agreements \nas a serious policy option. Surprisingly, the first proposal for an FTA with Japan did not \ncome from an Asian neighbour, but from Mexico. However, Singapore became the \npartner in the first actual agreement, for domestic political and tactical reasons outlined \nbelow. So far, all Japanese FTA initiatives have followed a similar pattern: first a study \nby a bilateral, tri-sectoral commission of governments, academics and business, then \nworking level dialogues, followed by actual negotiations at the level of Ministries. As of \n2005, Japan is seeking FTAs with Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and the Philippines. \nIn all cases, a fierce political struggle has ensued, allowing for a comparison of the merits \nof theories of regionalism in the light of the Japanese case. \n \n \n \n6 \n  \nCurrent Explanations of Regionalism \n \nIn recent theoretical debates, IPE scholars attribute the popularity of regional \nagreements to two main causes: the slowing of multilateral liberalization efforts, and \ndomestic politics, often revolving around multinational firms and imperfect competition. \nMansfield and Reinhardt (2003) argue that regional agreements function as an insurance \npolicy against trade disputes and a stalled WTO. Preferential trade agreements spread \nwhen multilateral rounds are underway, or countries become embroiled in commercial \ndisputes that threaten access to export markets. These arguments are echoed by Japanese \ntrade bureaucrats and some observers of Japanese trade policy (Dent, 2003: 10-1, 5; \nKrauss, 2003; Urata, 2002: 11-20). \nYet as countered by Haggard (1997), if the WTO is stalled, then the central issue \nis the convergence or divergence of state interests. Agricultural liberalization remains the \nperennial problem of WTO rounds. Japan\u2019s resistance to open its market further, though, \ncreates one of the main obstacles to progress. At the same time, Japan is among the most \nvocal demandeurs for the incorporation of new issues like rules for FDI. It seems that \nmultilateral rounds are too slow for some Japanese constituents - whose views tend to be \narticulated by METI - and too quick for the protected agricultural sector. Possibly, FTAs \ncan be negotiated faster because with weak WTO disciplines on FTAs, they allow the \nexclusion of sensitive sectors (Bhagwati, et al., 1996: 687; Ravenhill, 2003: 307-9). This \nshifts the focus to domestic politics and the constituency in favour of FTAs. \nMilner (1997) proposes that firms in industries characterized by economies of \nscale will support regional agreements. If firms can expand their market, they can move \n7 \n  \ndown the cost curve enough to increase profits, even though the price of their product \nfalls. Milner hypothesizes that increasing returns to scale (IRS) determine an optimal \nmarket size, which may be regional but not global (85). Moreover, firms that become \nmore efficient regionally will also be more competitive when exporting beyond the FTA \nmarket. This theory explains well why competitive firms with unrealized economies of \nscale in small markets will support regional liberalization efforts with bigger countries. \nBut it offers less insight into the motivations of big countries: why would they allow \ncompetitors to enter their home market, when they gain only a small market in return? \nLikewise, it omits the possibility that production may be relocated. If IRS are firm-\nspecific, then these companies should prefer to export rather than invest. In practice, \nhowever, FTAs tend to coincide with considerable increases in FDI. \nChase (2003) addresses these problems and extends the theory in two directions. \nFirst, he points out that IRS matter at the level of the plant rather than the firm. If firms \nhave unrealized IRS that would increase rapidly with growing plant size, these firms will \nbe interested in market expansion through FTAs. Second, regional agreements help solve \ncommitment problems when firms move labour-intensive stages of production abroad. \nFirms make highly specific investments, exposing them to a higher risk of disruptions in \nthe production process. FTAs safeguard such international production-sharing. Finally, if \nproduction-sharing requires a restructuring of existing operations, then differential tariff-\nphasing in FTAs can be used to temporarily extend protection to incumbent firms (Chase, \n2004). \nBy themselves, however, these arguments are insufficient to explain Japan\u2019s FTA \npolicy. Production-sharing takes place even without FTAs. Firms can import their \n8 \n  \nproducts into home markets because developed country tariffs are usually very low - \noften zero in the case of Japan. Offshore processing, the tariff-free import of parts and re-\nexport after labour-intensive stages of production, is regularly obtainable in developing \ncountries (Feenstra, et al., 2000; McIntyre, et al., 1996; Warr, 1990). When will firms see \nFTAs as necessary to achieve the same ends? \nI propose that they do so in reaction to other countries\u2019 policies. Various scholars \nhave argued that countries join preferential trade agreements (PTAs) as a result of \nstrategic interaction (de Melo and Panagariya, 1993: 5-6; Oye, 1992; Perroni and \nWhalley, 1996). Empirical tests have offered limited support of this hypothesis \n(Mansfield, 1998). If trade diversion and loss of export markets are the central concern, \nhowever, PTAs should expand and possibly grow into economic blocs centred on major \npowers, as hypothesized by Baldwin (1996). But with the exception of the enlarged EU, \nas much a political as an economic phenomenon, regional agreements do not appear to \nexpand or emerge into competing blocs. Rather, we observe a dense network of bilateral \nFTAs. A focus on the role of foreign direct investment and the vertical integration of \nproduction modifies the argument and solves these puzzles: FTAs are important \ncommercial policy instruments that confer advantages to firms when undertaking FDI \nand production-sharing across borders. Yet if one developed country supports its industry \nwith a bilateral agreement, it becomes imperative for other countries to counter. Japan\u2019s \nbilateral initiatives are strategic moves to preserve the competitiveness of Japanese \nmultinational firm operations when other countries are actively seeking FTAs. The next \nsection outlines this framework. \n \n9 \n  \nForeign Direct Investment and Competitive Liberalization \n \nFDI plays a central role in research into the incentives for developing countries to \nenter preferential trade agreements. Both Latin American and Southeast Asian \ndeveloping countries have opted for FTAs with developed countries as part of liberalizing \npolicies. The benefits are twofold. First, they serve to lock-in international commitments \nto liberalization, often against the interests of domestic groups (Fern\u00e1ndez and Portes, \n1998; Rodrik, 1989, 1991). Second, developing countries secure tariff-free access to \nmarkets like the US or Japan to compete as \u2018export platforms\u2019 among themselves (Ethier, \n1998). Building on these studies, the following argument rests on the assumption that \ndeveloping countries (henceforth host countries) seek FTAs to attract foreign direct \ninvestment. \nBut what about the developed country in the bilateral partnership? I argue that \nthey respond to demands by multinational firms. Firms support FTAs because they offer \ncompetitive advantages when using a developing country as an export platform. I develop \nthe argument in two stages, first clarifying firm preferences, then outlining when and why \nthey are likely to prevail in the political arena. \nThree assumptions underpin the argument. First, following recent work in \neconomics on the vertical integration of production (Fukao, et al., 2003; Mart\u00edn and Orts, \n2001), I assume that multinational firms invest in developing countries to benefit from \ndifferent factor endowments. Relatively low wages, the same reason why these countries \nare only minor export markets, may make them highly attractive locations for investment, \ngiven the right political conditions. Second, as in Chase\u2019s (2003) framework, such \n10 \n  \nproduction will be characterized by economies of scale at the plant level, requiring \nexports to home and other developed country markets. Finally, multinationals compete \nmainly with firms from other developed countries. \nOne immediate benefit of bilateral agreements is that they allow multinational \nfirms to import parts and machinery from the home into the host country at reduced tariff \nrates. Often, developing host countries still charge higher most-favoured-nation (MFN) \ntariffs than developed countries. Reducing this tariff becomes crucial when firms \nintegrate production vertically, whereby the most capital-intensive intermediate goods are \nfurther processed in the export-platform country. \nIn addition, bilateral trade agreements offer firms a specific benefit over \nmultilateral liberalization: they can generate economic rents. As developing countries \nliberalize, firms can move labour-intensive stages of production into developing \ncountries, allowing them to produce more efficiently and re-export to the home market. \nBut since other firms will likewise invest in these countries, competition will rapidly \ndiminish any profits made possible by greater efficiency. Bilateral agreements, however, \ncan be used to restrict access to this benefit of location, if host countries impose a \nsufficiently high tariff on imports from non-members. \nTo this end, firms from the home country will try to harness the remaining MFN \ntariff. They will lobby for strict rules of origin to ensure that goods imported from the \ndeveloping country mainly originate in the FTA (Anson, et al., 2003; Chase, 2003: 166-\n68; Suominen, 2004). Although firms from non-member countries can invest in the \ndeveloping country, their intermediate goods imports incur higher tariffs. Likewise, home \ncountry firms will try to ban host countries from rebating MFN tariffs on components and \n11 \n  \nmachinery for non-members. Strict rules of origin thus interact with the preferential \nmargin, the difference between the MFN tariff applied by host countries and the tariff-\nfree exchange within the FTA, so that competition in the home market can be restricted to \nhome country firms. This holds until the host country unilaterally reduces its MFN tariffs. \nIn sum, to generate economic rents, FTAs have to incorporate clauses that discriminate \nagainst outsiders. FTAs thus become commercial policy instruments to further the \ncompetitiveness of multinational firms.  \nHow will this play out in the political arena? Seen through the lens of a political \neconomy framework inspired by Grossman and Helpman (1994), political leaders mainly \ncare about getting re-elected. Trade liberalization affects consumer surplus, producer \nprofits, and tariff revenues. In practical terms, tariff revenues are negligible for developed \ncountries. Lower tariffs benefit consumers by allowing cheaper imports. With the \nrelocation of production to the FTA partner, import prices tend to fall somewhat, because \nproduction is more efficient. This benefits the consumer. But because competition is \nrestricted, producer surplus also rises. Bilateral agreements offer a compromise between \nconsumer and producer surplus that appeals to political leaders.  \nIt could be countered in the tradition of the developmental state literature (Aoki, \net al., 1996; Hall, 1986; Johnson, 1982; Wade, 1990; Woo-Cumings, 1999) that in Japan, \ntrade policy is made by bureaucrats, not elected politicians. Sheltered from pressure, \nbureaucrats have a longer time horizon. But under the assumptions made here, Japanese \nbureaucrats care primarily for their constituents. For METI bureaucrats, this means \nmanufacturing firms. After all, firms can offer rewards: lucrative positions after \nretirement from public service, a practice known as amakudari or \u2018descent from heaven\u2019 \n12 \n  \n(Curtis, 1999: 233-4). These bureaucrats should therefore become key supporters of \nbilateral trade agreements. \nAll liberalization, however, threatens import-competing sectors. Since the \npartners are developing countries, these sectors will likely be agricultural producers and \nlabour. At first glance, labour should uniformly resist relocation of production (Rodrik, \n1997). Yet vertical integration tends to divide labour along firm lines: firms that produce \nintermediate goods for overseas production benefit from FTAs (Chase, 2003: 184). If \nlabour is organized in firms and only weakly centralized, as in Japan, we should expect \nlittle resistance. \nAgricultural producers will mount the strongest resistance to bilateral \nliberalization. FTAs, however, leave much room for the exclusion of sensitive sectors, \ngiven the weak WTO disciplines on preferential agreements. According to Article 24 of \nthe GATT, they should liberalize \u201csubstantially all trade,\u201d which in practice allows the \nexclusion of ten per cent of trade or more. If the partner country produces only a few \nagricultural goods, a deal will indeed be easier to reach than in a multilateral round. FTAs \nwith major agricultural producers, however, should be rare for a country like Japan, and \ndifficult even with small developing countries. \nWhen will the demands of multilateral firms outweigh those of protectionist \nforces? Most likely only when the competitive pressures warrant great lobbying efforts. \nThis should be the case when existing FTAs by other countries impose costs on firms \nwith FDI overseas, or when such FTAs are announced and potentially threaten \nmultinational firms\u2019 operations in developing countries. The rents generated by FTAs \nimply a competitive disadvantage for investor firms from third parties. Competing firms \n13 \n  \nwill press their respective governments to counter with FTAs. Although these FTAs \ncannot eliminate rules-of-origin requirements, they weaken their protectionist force by \nlowering the tariffs on imported parts. Consequently, bilateral agreements trigger \ncounter-agreements by affected third parties. North-South FTAs therefore fall into two \ncategories: \u2018proactive FTAs\u2019 that exclude outsiders, and \u2018defensive FTAs\u2019 that level the \nplaying field again. A closer look at the Japanese FTA initiatives illustrates the elements \nof the argument above. While the initial reaction was defensive in the form of the Japan-\nMexico-FTA, the more recent initiative for an FTA with Thailand has a decidedly \nproactive character. \n \nNAFTA and the Defensive FTA Strategy \n \nJapan\u2019s policy shift originated in a defensive reaction triggered by the effects of \nNAFTA. Over the last 15 years, Japanese firms have made considerable investments in \nMexico. Due to their traditional competitive advantages, most Japanese FDI in Mexico is \nconcentrated in sectors such as automobiles, auto parts, consumer electronics and \nelectronic components.  \nA particular feature of the Mexican economy is the maquiladora (in-bond \nmanufacturing) sector. Under this programme, dating back to 1965, foreign investors \ncould set up factories in the region south of the US border to profit from low Mexican \nwages. Products could be imported into Mexico from the US, processed, and re-exported. \nUpon entering the US, tariffs were only levied on the value added abroad. This system \nattracted considerable investment from Japan in consumer electronics and electronics \n14 \n  \nparts: Well-known manufacturers like Sharp and Sony used their US subsidiaries to \ncreate affiliated companies in Mexico. \nInitially, most Japanese FDI sought efficiency gains made by employing low-cost \nMexican labour. Geographic proximity and preferential access guaranteed under the \nmaquiladora factory system facilitated serving the US market (Nikkei Sangyou Shimbun, \n31 July 1991), but also other countries in the region (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2 March \n1999). Japanese investors primarily saw Mexico as an export platform rather than a \nmarket in its own right. \nThe conclusion of NAFTA, however, put these Japanese investors at a \ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis their US competitors. Under pressure from US automobile \ncompanies, NAFTA negotiators agreed that in order to qualify as a \u2018North American\u2019 \nproduct, 62.5 per cent of a car would have to originate from within NAFTA (Robert, \n2000: 152-63). After witnessing that Honda transplant factories in Canada used \nconsiderable foreign content under a 50 per cent rule-of-origin, US automakers wanted to \nprevent Mexico from becoming another export platform to threaten their home market \n(Cameron and Tomlin, 2000: 90-3, 132-36). Similar rules-of-origin were put in place for \na variety of other products, usually with a 50 per cent threshold on a net cost basis.7 At \nthe same time, the auto decrees were being phased out over a period of ten years. \nSecond, in accordance with NAFTA Art. 303, the maquiladora system was \nfundamentally transformed. In the negotiations with the US, Mexico agreed to allow duty \nfree temporary inputs from outside of NAFTA only if a) the finished good complies with \nthe rule-of-origin when exported to another NAFTA country, or b) the final product is \nexported to a non-NAFTA country. As a result, considerable Japanese investment in \n15 \n  \nMexico aimed at serving the US market was affected by the difference between Mexico\u2019s \napplied MFN and NAFTA tariffs. Japanese companies paid 5-16 per cent tariff when \nsourcing important intermediate goods such as machinery or parts, e.g. cathode tubes for \nTV sets (United States Trade Representative, 2000: 284; Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 12 \nDecember 2002). A sectoral promotion scheme called PROSEC offered tariff relief for \nindividual firms, but was perceived as unpredictable and insufficient by Japanese firms \n(Japan Machinery Center for Trade and Investment, 2001). Vertically integrated Japanese \nmanufacturing investment in Mexico proved vulnerable to disruption by NAFTA. \nNAFTA\u2019s discriminatory effect on FDI from non-members did not go unnoticed \nby Japanese industry representatives for long. In a 1991 interview, the regional managers \nof several Japanese firms in Mexico referred to NAFTA as an \u2018assault on Japanese firms\u2019 \n(Nikkei Sangyou Shimbun, 30 July 1991). Already in 1994, the Federation of Japanese \nIndustry (Keidanren) noted the \u2018regionalistic\u2019 aspect of NAFTA in a comment on the \nGATT review of the FTA.8 Over the course of the next years, Japanese lobby groups \nbegan to press the Japanese and Mexican governments for relief. By 1996, electronics \nfirms were under pressure to meet the rules-of-origin requirements of NAFTA when \nexporting to the US. Despite efforts to procure more parts from within Mexico, it became \nobvious that the Mexican supply industry could not supplant imports within the \ntimeframe of five years until the abolishment of the maquiladora benefits. In a first, but \nunsuccessful effort, Japanese firms under the umbrella of the Japan Maquiladora \nAssociation (JMA) began to lobby the Mexican government directly for tariff reductions \n(Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 5 January 1996). The Japanese Institute for Overseas Investment \n(1997) referred to the problems in an assessment of the Mexican investment environment \n16 \n  \nand specifically emphasized the resulting difficulties for the export of machinery from \nJapan. \nHowever, given the declared strategy of Mexican government to negotiate FTAs \nwith all major trade partners, it showed little interest in a further reduction of its MFN \ntariff. Rather, the Mexican government prodded Japan to consider a bilateral agreement. \nHerminio Blanco, then Mexican Minister for Foreign Trade and Industry, and President \nZedillo used various occasions to remind Japanese companies of pending changes in the \nmaquiladora system (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 7 October 1998), the advantages of \ninvestment treaties (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 5 November 1998), and the benefits of an \nFTA with Mexico for foreign investors (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2 March 1999).  \nSince the discriminatory effect of NAFTA depended on the tariffs applied by the \nhost country, Japanese firms exhausted all possibilities to press the Mexican government \nfor a reduction of these tariffs. At the same time, Japanese firms were most likely aware \nthat a bilateral deal with Mexico was unprecedented and difficult, given the protectionist \nagricultural sector that had restricted Japan\u2019s APEC policy. This strengthens the view of \nJapan as a challenging case for the argument advanced here and explains why an FTA \nwas only considered much later. For an FTA to become a viable policy, the coalition in \nfavour of trade agreements had to be broadened and advocates in the trade bureaucracy \nhad to be found. \n \n \n \n \n17 \n  \nThe Conversion of the Japanese Trade Bureaucracy \n \nDespite institutional reforms in Japan, bureaucratic politics remain at the heart of \nJapanese trade policy. Ministries conduct trade policy at the behest of their \nconstituencies, while politicians of the ruling Liberal--Democratic Party (LDP) \noccasionally veto initiatives that endanger rural interests. As a result, Japanese \nbureaucrats nurture close relations with their constituent interest groups. Likewise, \nJapanese trade policy has no equivalent of hearings before the US Senate in which \nconcerned parties voice their views. Consequently, while lobbying leaves even less of a \npaper trail than in other countries, it is evident that ministries regularly consult with \ninterest groups, leading to a transmission of firm interests through the bureaucracy. In the \ncase of METI, multinational firms in the manufacturing sector are among the most \nimportant constituencies. \nConsultations with firms about NAFTA\u2019s discriminatory effect on Japanese direct \ninvestment in Mexico changed the perceptions of key policymakers in Japan\u2019s trade \nbureaucracy. Both ministries realized that US and European FTAs endangered the \ncompetitiveness of Japanese production abroad.9 MITI\/METI emerged as the driving \nforce behind the shift towards a \u2018multi-layered\u2019 trade policy (Munakata, 2001). Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs (MOFA) bureaucrats appeared more interested in balancing the \nvarious interests, but also provided important policy leadership in deciding that selective \nbilateral rather than broader regional options would be pursued in the near term, since a \nJapan-ASEAN-FTA would be difficult to bring into compliance with GATT Art. 24.10 \n18 \n  \nBy 1998, the increasingly concerned voices of Japanese multinationals with \nsubsidiaries abroad convinced two key policymakers of the need to pursue bilateral \noptions: Tanaka Hitoshi,11 Director General of the Economic Affairs Bureau of MOFA, \nand former MITI Vice-Minister Hatakeyama Noboru, then Chairman of JETRO. In early \nsummer of 1998, Hatakeyama met with his Mexican colleague Blanco in Tokyo, who \ninformed him of the framework agreement with the EU that would eventually lead to an \nFTA. Hatakeyama suggested to then-MITI Minister Yosano Kaoru to pursue an active \nFTA strategy to counter a further deterioration of the competitive position of Japanese \ncompanies in Mexico. (Hatakeyama, 2003b: 24).12 While a report was prepared under the \nguidance of Konno Hidehiro, at the time Director General of MITI\u2019s International Trade \nPolicy Bureau, various bureaus expressed concern that an extra-regional FTA initiative \nwould send the wrong diplomatic signal for future agreements: The first Japanese FTA \nought to be concluded with an Asian neighbour.13 \nAt the same time, discussions began in MOFA\u2019s Economic Affairs Bureau, again \nset off by consultations with affected Japanese firms. Under Director General Tanaka, a \npolicy paper was prepared that would eventually provide the roadmap for MOFA\u2019s \npursuit of FTAs.14 However, there was considerable opposition to bilateral agreements \nwithin the Ministry: Multilateralism had served Japan (and the careers of officials trained \nin international law) well for four decades.15 After a lengthy process of consensus-\nbuilding, MOFA\u2019s new stance was documented by publication of an article by Tanaka \n(2000) in the monthly magazine Chuuoo Kouron. \nIn cooperation, METI and MOFA then pursued a strategy that would tackle the \nideological and material opposition to FTAs one at a time. To this end, Singapore was \n19 \n  \nselected as the partner for the first bilateral agreement on the grounds that it exported \nvirtually no agricultural products.16 The first FTA thus had limited political or economic \nrelevance, but provided a template for future negotiations. \n \nLobbying Around the New Trade Policy \n \nFollowing the policy shift of MOFA and METI, but facing the still unresolved \nproblem in Mexico, Toyota decided to push for trade liberalization in anticipation of \nfuture FDI, although it did not have significant operations in Mexico at the time,17 \n(Nikkan Kougyou Shimbun, 23 September 2002). Canon even closed a plant in May \n2002, citing lack of progress in concluding a bilateral trade deal.18 Nissan, an incumbent \nsince 1961, partly benefited from NAFTA\u2019s rules-of-origin because it achieved a \nrelatively high Mexican content quota (Nikkei Sangyou Shimbun, 30 July 1991). Over \ntime, however, the position of Nissan began to approximate that of Toyota. The initial \nincumbency benefits became problematic when the 1994 Mexican currency crisis \ndepressed domestic demand, forcing Nissan to export more of its production to the US \n(Walzer, 1995; Nikkan Kougyou Shimbun, 7 June 2001). The company thus moved from \na passive stance to become an active supporter of a bilateral trade agreement. METI \nofficials gave Nissan\u2019s views considerable weight, \u201csince the 20,000 or so cars that Japan \nexports to Mexico pale in comparison to the hundred thousands Nissan can produce there \nand sell in the US,\u201d which in turn would generate business for Japanese suppliers and \nmachine tools producers.19 \n20 \n  \nConcurrently, the Mexican branch of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry lobbied METI to conclude an FTA (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 31 July 2003). \nKeidanren called for the speedy conclusion of a Japan-Mexico FTA in policy paper in \n1999 and 2000, specifically stressing the need to shorten lead-times of production by \ninitially importing parts from Japan, as well as emphasizing the increasing difficulties of \nJapanese upstream producers of steel, chemicals and plant equipment in the Mexican \nmarket.20 Similar lobbying efforts were made by the Japan Business Council for Trade \nand Investment Facilitation (boueki toushi enkatsu kyougikai) and the Japan Machinery \nCentre for Trade and Investment (JMCTI), which called for an FTA as a result of a \nsurvey on problems relating to trade and investment in the Asian and Pacific Countries.21 \nThe emergent coalition in support of an FTA matches the predictions made \nearlier. The most vocal supporters were firms using Mexico as an export-platform, and \ntheir suppliers of intermediate and capital goods. There is less evidence of calls for an \nFTA by exporters of finished goods. Apparently, the Mexican export market by itself did \nnot warrant such lobbying efforts. \nIn June of 2001, a joint Japanese-Mexican tripartite study group was convened to \nprovide an assessment of the potential effects of an FTA between the two countries. The \ngroup eventually published a report that underlined the need for an agreement to counter \nthe effects of NAFTA. At the October 2002 APEC meeting in Los Cabos, President Fox \nand Prime Minister Koizumi agreed to launch official negotiations in November (Nihon \nKeizai Shimbun, 27 October 2002). Unlike Singapore, however, Mexico is a major \nsupplier of agricultural products: 19 per cent of its exports to Japan are pork meat. This \nprompted an immediate reaction from LDP constituents in rural areas, including two \n21 \n  \nvisits by the President of the Japanese association of agricultural cooperatives Zenchu to \nthe office of Cabinet Secretary Fukuda in November of 2002, and the distribution of \npolicy papers to LDP parliamentarians in April 2003 (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 12 \nDecember 2002; Nikkei Weekly, 19 May 19 2003). While the conclusion of the Japan-\nMexico Economic Partnership Agreement was scheduled for Presidents Fox\u2019s visit to \nTokyo in October 2003, a delay of several months was necessary due to disagreements \nover the degree of agricultural liberalization. The key to striking a deal, as predicted, was \nto carve out the \u2018sensitive\u2019 pork imports into Japan. Using a complex formula, Japan not \nonly limits imports to a quota, but also applies a tariff that brings up the price of Mexican \npork to the Japanese \u2018gate price\u2019 guaranteed to domestic farmers.22 The exclusion of most \nagricultural trade shows that Japanese farmers and their representation of interests \nthrough the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Fishery (MAFF) is still strong enough \nto stall METI initiatives for liberalization. Japan\u2019s FTA policy is therefore not the result \nof diminished influence of import-competing sectors or the ministries that represent their \ninterests. More likely, FTAs allow agricultural protectionism to persist when it would \ndifficult to maintain in the WTO. \nBy contrast, labour unions were less active in their opposition to the FTA. \nAlthough officially critical of the agreement with Mexico,23 they did not ally against it \nwith agricultural groups. Labour opposition against later FTA initiatives, however, was \nexpressed through the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. \nThe relevance of the Japan-Mexico FTA goes beyond its immediate economic \nimpact. Mexican negotiators drew frequently on their experiences with NAFTA and the \nEU-Mexico FTA, forcing METI bureaucrats to become familiar with these agreements.24 \n22 \n  \nMost importantly, high METI officials were convinced that to prevent a repetition of the \nexperience of Japanese firms in Mexico in other countries, Japan would have to pursue \nFTAs proactively. These efforts became urgent because of changes of host country \npolicies in Southeast Asia, partly stimulated by the Asian Financial Crisis. The following \nsection focuses on the case of Japan\u2019s FTA initiative with Thailand, a country that is \nquickly becoming an important export-platform for Japanese firms. \n \nThe Proactive Pursuit of FTAs: Supporting Japanese Firms in Thailand \n \nIn Southeast Asia, the \u2018contagion\u2019 of the Asian Financial Crisis forced countries \nto try to attract more FDI rather than volatile portfolio investment. The crisis thus boosted \na process of investment liberalization that had come off a slow start in the early 1990s \n(Yoshimatsu, 1999), and gave further impetus to the development of the ASEAN Free \nTrade and ASEAN Investment areas (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 7 October 1998, 10 \nDecember 1998). It rapidly altered the environment for Japanese firms with existing \noperations in Asia that had been set up under restrictive host country policies. The \nliberalization efforts thus show important parallels to those undertaken by Latin \nAmerican countries, in particular Mexico. METI and MOFA proactively pursue FTAs \nwith these countries to provide support to Japanese firms, buttressing a reorientation \ntowards exports. \nAlthough Thailand based its economic development to a great extent on FDI, the \ncountry originally imposed strict requirements on manufacturing investment. Japanese \nFDI was oriented towards regional markets rather than exports, with about 60 per cent \n23 \n  \ntargeting regional sales (Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), 2003: 18; \nMETI Overseas Activities of Japanese firms, cited in Kitamura, 2003: 22). In the \nautomobile industry, Japanese investment began in the 1970s under tightly constrained \nconditions. The host country government mandated ever-higher local content quota \n(Doner, 1991: 40-63; Humphrey and Oeter, 2000: 59-60), making it difficult to achieve \nefficient production scales and driving up prices for domestic sales as a result. \nConsequently, Japanese manufacturers built their regional production networks around \nhost country policies whereby locally produced parts could be sourced tariff-free within \nASEAN, provided local content quota were fulfilled (Yoshimatsu, 1999, 2002). In an \nimplicit bargain, these schemes also acted as a barrier to the entry of competitors (Doner, \n1997: 112), because the small market size required large, \u2018commanding\u2019 shares to be \nefficient. As a result, as of 1992, Japanese affiliates accounted for 94 per cent of \nproduction in Thailand (Hatch and Yamamura, 1996: 37). Likewise, in Malaysia and \nIndonesia, combined imports and local assembly by Japanese firms accounted for 70-95 \nper cent of all auto sales (Mukai, 1997; Noble, 2002; Takeuchi, 1993). Although \nJapanese firms supported further integration of ASEAN markets to achieve economies of \nscale (Yoshimatsu, 1999), both Honda and Yamaha at the time expressed the hope that \nthey could forestall further liberalization of external ASEAN tariffs.25 \nIn comparison, the electronics sector in Thailand is characterized by a much \nstronger presence of US firms and production networks. Yet, whereas US firms initially \nsought local low-cost suppliers to produce for re-export to other advanced markets, much \nJapanese investment served nascent regional markets (Borrus, 1999: 220).  \n24 \n  \nUntil the mid-1990s, Japanese investment was thus primarily tariff-jumping, \noriented towards host country markets, and put a low emphasis on exports. Yet in the \nwake of the Asian Financial Crisis, the conditions for Japanese FDI changed. Slumping \ndemand and trade liberalization begun to affect Japanese production networks, while \nKorean and Western firms began to make inroads into previously uncontested markets \n(Noble, 2002). In the ASEAN-Five,26 non-Japanese firms increased their share of the \npassenger car market from 5-10 per cent to 25-30 per cent compared to the early 1990s, \nprompting Ford and GM to make new investments that competed with Japanese \nincumbents in local markets (Yoshimatsu, 2002).  \nAt the same time, host country governments liberalized the investment \nenvironment in order to attract more FDI. Thailand made bold steps towards \nliberalization of the investment regime, partly as a requirement of the IMF support \npackage,27 and abolished limits on equity holdings by foreigners in 1998. Likewise, it \neliminated the 30 per cent export requirement necessary to qualify for an exemption from \nimport duties on goods used in local manufacturing. (United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, 1998: 342, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 10 December 1998). \nUnder these circumstances, Japanese firms could no longer maintain their old \nbusiness model. Host country liberalization created a stiff wind of competition and \neliminated the rents earned in protected markets, while falling currencies diminished \npurchasing power. At the same time, however, the depreciation of the Thai Baht created \nthe prospect of a highly competitive production for export, with unit costs reaching \ncomparable levels to those in China (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 17 November 1998). \n25 \n  \nJapanese automotive firms reacted quickly. Already before the crisis, the \nexpansion of automotive parts production for export to Japan had accelerated. Firms \nbegan a rapid process of centralization and restructuring of their operations in Thailand to \nachieve high capacity utilization rates (Kagaku Kougyou Nippou, 8 September 2003; \nNikkei Bijinesu Daily, 12 February 2004). In an unprecedented development, Japanese \nmanufacturers began to ship finished cars to the home market. The striking trend \nbecomes apparent in figure 1. While no separate data on the exports of Japanese auto and \nauto parts manufacturers from Thailand to Japan is available, it is safe to assume that \nvirtually all are shipments of Japanese-owned producers, given the notorious lack of \nsuccess of foreign brands in Japan. Exports of parts and complete vehicles grew \nexponentially within a short time, although it should be noted that the overall volume is \nstill low. \n \n--- Figure 1 about here --- \n \nBesides taking up the production of passenger cars for the Japanese market, all \nmajor manufacturers developed and started to implement plans to use Thailand as an \nexport platform for other markets (Nikkan Jidousha Nyuusu, 22 March 2003). \nConcurrent with the start of FTA negotiations with Thailand, Japanese firms announced \nplans for significant investments in the country. Toyota confirmed the production of the \n\u201cIMV International Multipurpose Vehicle,\u201d a light pickup truck for exports to markets in \nEurope as well as important developing countries (Nikkei Bijinesu Daily, 8 August 2004). \n26 \n  \nSuppliers closely affiliated with the group such as Aisin Seiki, Aichi Steel, NSK and \nDenso prepared to quickly increase production (Nikkei Bijinesu Daily, 12 February 2004; \nNihon Keizai Shimbun 24 August 2004). Initial plans proved to be too conservative, \nmotivating Toyota to increase production capacity from 140,000 to 260,000 units per \nyear (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 7 May 2004). Nissan presented plans to expand production \ncapacity in Thailand by over 50 per cent (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 3 July 2004). Honda \nconsidered building a second plant for its small, environmentally friendly car model \nmarketed as \u201cLife\u201d in Japan, because its current factory operated at full capacity (Nihon \nKeizai Shimbun, 6 December 2004). Even struggling automaker Mitsubishi announced a \ncapacity expansion of 30 per cent because of the rising demand for pickup trucks in \nEurope (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 25 August 2004). \nJapanese electronics firms, having replicated the production network strategy of \nthe automobile sector, were affected by the same forces when host countries began to \nliberalize their markets, although many of the new entrants were in fact local companies in \nKorea, Singapore and Malaysia (Borrus, 1999: 224). Although many firms also produced \nin China, Japanese multinationals were not willing to abandon Southeast Asia as a \nproduction base, likely because operations in the ASEAN countries tend to be more \nprofitable than those in China (JETRO survey, cited in Mainichi Economist, 15 July \n2003). In consumer electronics, Thailand\u2019s wage and currency advantages attracted \ninvestment that in the past would have gone to Malaysia or Singapore (Nikkei Weekly, 3 \nMay 2004). Similar developments affected the upstream component of Japanese \ninvestment in the chemical industry (Nikkan Kougyou Shimbun, 26 May 2000). \n27 \n  \nThe changes in the operations of Japanese firms in Thailand were quickly relayed \nto MITI bureaucrats, who in 1999 began a formal study on how to offer government \nsupport for firms in a changed environment (Nikkan Kougyou Shimbun, 22 March 1999). \nCompanies interested in supplying Japanese factories abroad with machinery also \nexpressed their interest in an FTA with Thailand to METI in consultations.28 Following \ndiscussions in the International Trade Policy Bureau as well as the regional bureaus, \nMITI\/METI began to develop plans for an FTA with Thailand.29 Given the strength of \nprotectionist agricultural groups, however, the success of this policy depends on \nJapanese firms with investment in Thailand and their chain of suppliers, the central \nconstituency in favour of a free trade agreement. \n \nThe Political Struggle over an FTA with Thailand \n \nJust like in the case of the Japan-Mexico FTA, a successful negotiating outcome \ndepends on an accommodation of Japanese agricultural pressure groups. Unlike Mexico, \nhowever, Thailand produces rice, the most sensitive product, as well as several other \nagricultural exports that hurt important lobbies in Japan. \nTogether with LDP politicians of the infamous nourin zoku, or farm and forestry \ntribe, MAFF managed to delay negotiations that were scheduled to start in June 2003 \nafter the visit of the Thai Prime Minister to Japan (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 9 June 2003) \nby almost seven months. In addition, MAFF officials publicly discussed the possibility of \na blanket exclusion for rice as a precondition for an FTA with Thailand (Nihon Keizai \nShimbun, 9 June 2003; Nikkei Weekly, 15 December 2003). To still approach close to 90 \n28 \n  \nper cent coverage of trade and comply with WTO Art. 24 requirements, the remaining \nagricultural trade would have to be completely covered.30 Boneless chicken, the second \nmajor export commodity, therefore became a stumbling block (Nikkei News, 6 August \n2004). \nTo counter the protectionist groups, several industries organized a concerted \nlobbying effort. Keidanren acted as vanguard of these firms\u2019 interests in the public battle, \nstarting with a November 2003 policy statement that requested the pursuit of FTAs with \nthe advanced ASEAN countries.31 During the following months, the association called for \nthe speedy conclusion of an FTA, warning that US firms were outcompeting Japanese \nfirms in terms of using Thailand as production base because of the better investment \nconditions afforded to US firms under the US-Thailand Treaty of Commerce and \nNavigation (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 18 April; 12 May 2004). Similar demands had been \nrepeatedly raised by the Japan Business Council for Trade and Investment Facilitation in \na policy paper submitted to METI (Hideya, 2003). After mentioning the initiative for an \nFTA as positive step, the paper also addressed the issue of intermediate and capital goods \nexports to Thailand: \n\u201c[Regarding electronics parts, ball bearings and rubbers] it is \nrequested that a further cut in tariff rates be undertaken (\u2026), keeping \nin mind the materials that cannot be produced in Thailand. \nFurthermore, the tariffs on cutting tools ought to be reduced rapidly. \n(\u2026) On auto parts, the duty ranges from 5 to 42 per cent, \nnecessitating a significant reduction.\u201d \n29 \n  \nAs these demands show, using Thailand as an export basis would be greatly facilitated by \na reduction of host country tariffs, reflecting the fact that compared to their direct \ncompetitors, Japanese electronics firms still source much more inputs from their home \ncountry (Arimura, 2002; Guerrieri, 2000), leading to ratios of 85-90 per cent of trade \nwithin the firm or with close affiliates (Ernst, 2000: 83). \nConcern about the effect of a foundering of FTA negotiations were voiced by \nrepresentatives of the textile industry (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 9 June 2003), a sector with \nsignificant overseas production in Southeast Asia.32 Again, manufacturers cited the \nimportance of lowering barriers on intermediate goods (Nikkei Weekly, 15 December \n2003). The Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok warned that Japan would fall \nbehind in its international competitiveness without an FTA with Thailand (Toyo Keizai \nWeekly, 29 November 2003, 80).  \nNegotiations began in February 2004 in Bangkok, with initial Japanese proposals \nfocusing on improving the Thai investment environment for Japanese firms by \nguaranteeing national treatment (Nikkei News Service, 17 February 2004). MAFF indeed \nsought and obtained an exclusion of rice from the negotiations (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, \n10 June 2004, 10 October 2004). Reflecting the interests of Japanese automotive \nmanufacturers, the Japanese negotiating team began pushing for a reduction of tariffs on \ncars and parts (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 31 October 2004). This demand was publicly \nsupported by Keidanren Chairman Okuda, also President of Toyota Motors, who toured \nthe ASEAN countries to muster business support for free trade agreements (Nihon Keizai \nShimbun, 1 November 2004). \n30 \n  \nAlthough the outcome of the negotiations is still open, it is evident that the \nindustry interests supporting the initiative for an FTA with Thailand focus primarily on \nFDI. The ministries advancing the cause of bilateral free trade, MOFA and in particular \nMETI, receive crucial backing from those industries that have direct stakes in improving \nthe investment environment in Thailand and lowering tariffs on intermediate goods.  \nTaking up demands by Japanese firms, METI bureaucrats advance the FTA policy to \nstrengthen the position of Japanese firms vis-\u00e0-vis their competitors from other countries. \nAt the same time, the weak disciplines imposed by the WTO on FTAs allow the \ncontinued protection of import-competing agricultural producers. \n \n \nThe China Factor: Strategic Competition? \n \nAs argued, Japan\u2019s FTA initiatives reflect a global trend towards bilateral trade \nagreements. Remarkably, China has recently joined this bandwagon by negotiating a \nregional FTA with the ASEAN countries. Reversing the usual order, a basic agreement \nwas signed in 2002, while negotiations lasted until November 2004. Schedules for \nliberalization, however, are not to be completed until 2010. To give momentum to the \ntalks, China offered an \u201cearly harvest,\u201d whereby the tariffs on about 200 agricultural \nproducts were eliminated, with only minimal reciprocal liberalization required of \nCambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam (Lim, 2003). \nWhile some authors have argued that FTAs with ASEAN are signs of a \ncompetition between Japan and China (Hund, 2003: 411), the above discussion shows \n31 \n  \nthat the Japanese policy shift predates the Chinese initiative, first announced in \nNovember 2000, by at least two years: At that point, Japan had already entered into \nnegotiations with Singapore. Still, Chinese moves have spurred on Japanese \npolicymakers to match diplomatic initiatives,33 and may help the pro FTA constituency in \nJapan overcome domestic resistance. \n \nConclusion \n \nJapan\u2019s new bilateral trade initiatives have to be seen in the context of a global \nphenomenon: the rapid proliferation of preferential trade agreements, in particular \nbetween developed and developing countries. The new \u2018multilayered\u2019 trade policy thus \nfollows the lead of US and European trade policy towards liberalizing developing \ncountries. Yet, as the case study of the Japan-Mexico FTA shows, it is also a defensive \nreaction to these policies. Japanese policymakers worried about the effect of other \ncountries\u2019 FTAs on the competitiveness of Japanese firms. These concerns, however, did \nnot revolve primarily around exports, but focused on the effects of competitors\u2019 FTAs on \nfirm operations in developing countries. \nThe argument in this article can be extended in two directions. First, much FDI \nfrom developed to developing countries is in services rather than manufacturing. Such \nFDI does not create trade in intermediate goods. Nevertheless, if service trade is \nliberalized preferentially, imperfectly competitive market structures may result in \ncomparable reactions. This issue cannot be addressed based on the Japanese cases, given \nthat Japanese FDI is concentrated in manufacturing, especially in electronics and \n32 \n  \nautomobiles. Second, since Japanese multinational firms were latecomers in vertically \nintegrated operations, cases studying the lobbying by EU and US firms for FTAs would \noffer support for the argument if these firms could be shown to move earlier and make \ngreater lobbying efforts than their Japanese counterparts. Such questions remain to be \naddressed by future research. \n \n                                                \n1 http:\/\/www.wto.org\/english\/tratop_e\/region_e\/sem_nov03_e\/boonekamp_e.ppt \n2 Calculated based on Statistics Canada (1999) World Trade Analyzer, Ottawa, ON. \n3 See for example Munakata\u2019s editorial at \nhttp:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/views\/articles\/fellows\/munakata_20020710.htm, accessed 15 February 2005. \n4 See Fontagn\u00e9 and Freudenberg (1997) for a detailed analysis of vertical versus horizontal trade in similar \ngoods. \n5 MITI was subsequently reorganized and renamed Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).  \n6 Interview with former senior MITI official, Tokyo, November 2002. \n7 An overview is available provided by the Canadian Legal Information Institute at \nhttp:\/\/www.canlii.org\/ca\/regu\/sor94-14\/ \n8 \u2018Keidanren Views on the GATT Review of NAFTA,\u2019 1994, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.keidanren.or.jp\/english\/policy\/pol003.html.
