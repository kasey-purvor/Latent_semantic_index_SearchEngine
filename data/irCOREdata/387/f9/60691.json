Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, has been un-\ndergoing several related changes for at least two decades;\nthese include acceleration, thinning and grounding line re-\ntreat.

Increases in surface slope, and hence gravita-\ntional driving stress, correlate well with the acceleration and\nno sustained change in longitudinal stress gradient is needed\nto explain the force balance. There is no indication that the\nglacier is approaching a new steady state.\n1 Introduction\nIn recent decades Pine Island Glacier (PIG) has shown sev-\neral changes including grounding line retreat, acceleration\nand thinning (Rignot, 1998; Shepherd et al., 2002; Rignot et\nal., 2002). The PIG basin, which comprises 10% of the West\nAntarctic Ice Sheet, is getting increasingly out of balance,\nwith an estimated rate of net mass loss of 46 Gt a\u22121 in 2007\n(Rignot, 2008), the greatest imbalance of any ice stream in\nthe world. These changes may indicate the start of a period\nof major retreat. This could occur if the thinning causes un-\ngrounding of the weakly grounded \u201cice plain\u201d at the down-\nstream end of PIG (Payne et al., 2004), reducing the basal\nCorrespondence to: J. B. T. Scott\n(jbts@bas.ac.uk)\nresistance to flow and creating a positive feedback. It is thus\nimportant to determine precisely how thinning and acceler-\nation are linked, how they propagate upstream, and whether\nthere is any indication that PIG is stabilising.\nHitherto, observations of velocity change on PIG have\nbeen derived from satellite remote sensing data. In particular,\nInterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data have\nshown 10% acceleration between 1996 and 2000 extending\n100 km inland (Rignot et al., 2002; Joughin et al., 2003). Ve-\nlocity has increased since the 1990s, with the highest rate\nof acceleration recorded in 2007 (Rignot, 2008). However,\nthe temporal resolution of InSAR is limited by satellite orbit\nrepeat cycles. Short-term modulations of velocity, such as\nthose caused by semi-diurnal, diurnal and fortnightly oceanic\ntides (e.g. Anandakrishnan et al., 2003; Bindschadler et al.,\n2003; Gudmundsson, 2007), cannot always be resolved, and\nthere is a risk that some of these components may introduce\nbias. Also there are limited InSAR data available >100 km\ninland, therefore it has been difficult to assess the extent of\nthe recent acceleration. Data from GPS receivers can com-\nplement remote sensing data, giving greater temporal resolu-\ntion and extending the measurements further inland. In this\npaper we show the first GPS measurements of velocity and\nacceleration on Pine Island Glacier. We also use the GPS\nmeasurements, along with ICESat data (Zwally et al., 2007),\nto examine recent elevation changes. The relationship be-\ntween inland changes in driving stress and acceleration is ex-\namined, testing the hypothesis that recent inland acceleration\nmay be the result of a diffusive process, where changes in\nsurface slope are needed to transmit an initial perturbation\nalong the ice stream over decadal timescales (Payne et al.,\n2004).\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n126 J.

Map of Pine Island Glacier. Flowlines in red and purple;\ngrounding line (2000) in black. Background is velocity magnitude\nfrom ERS-1\/-2 data overlaid on a RADARSAT-1 mosaic (Rignot,\n2006).\n2 Observations\nBetween early-December 2006 and early-February 2007,\nthree GPS receivers were sited close to the central flowline\nof PIG (Fig. 1) at sites 55, 111, and 171 km upstream from\nthe grounding line (the 2000 flexing limit determined from\nInSAR, E. Rignot, personal communication, 2007). The\nsame geographic sites (hereafter PC55, PC111 and PC171\nrespectively), were reoccupied between mid-November 2007\nand early-February 2008, and a further GPS station, PS169,\nwas placed on a tributary to PIG, 169 km upstream from the\ngrounding line (Fig. 1).\nGPS data were recorded at 10 s intervals and processed\nto give kinematic precise point position solutions every 30 s.\nThis processing used the Bernese software and was the same\nas that used by Gudmundsson (2007). With this method\nit is possible to detect variations in horizontal position to\naround 0.01 m. A more detailed analysis of this processing\nmethod and the associated uncertainties is given by Dach et\nal. (2009).\nAt the beginning and end of the 2007\/2008 season, further\nGPS measurements were made to derive the strain rates in a\n1 km radius around each site. The surface profile along the\ncentral flowline was also measured by kinematic GPS, along\nwith net snow accumulation at PC55 and PC111.\n3 Mean velocity and acceleration\nThe mean velocity for the austral summer season, 2007\/2008,\nis given in Table 1, for all GPS sites; along with mean accel-\neration over both seasons (2006\/2007 and 2007\/2008) and\nover the between-season period. The measurement period at\nPS169 was too short to provide an accurate estimate of accel-\neration. All accelerations have been corrected for the effect\nof spatial gradients in the velocity field by using the local\nstrain rate estimates. Velocities and accelerations shown in\nTable 1 were calculated by fitting a quadratic function of time\nto in-line displacements for each measurement period. The\nuncertainty in the quadratic fit is the largest error in the cal-\nculation of the acceleration, these errors are given in Table 1.\nAcceleration was nearly constant, although some residuals\nbetween measured and fitted displacements indicate short-\nterm changes of velocity. The greatest of these changes are\ndiscussed later. Table 1 shows that the acceleration at PC55\nwas >130 ma\u22122 in both seasons, with a mean acceleration\nbetween the seasons of about 115 ma\u22122. Therefore the sum-\nmer acceleration appears slightly higher than the annual ac-\nceleration, although this difference is within the error limits\n(Table 1).\nThe Cryosphere, 3, 125\u2013131, 2009 www.the-cryosphere.net\/3\/125\/2009\/\nJ. B. T. Scott: Increased rate of acceleration on Pine Island Glacier 127\nWe can only compare the GPS velocity directly with a re-\ncent InSAR measurement at PC55, where an InSAR veloc-\nity estimate is available 124 days before the midpoint of the\n2006\/2007 GPS occupation (E. Rignot, personal communi-\ncation, 2007). The GPS velocity can be corrected for the time\ndifference between these measurements, using the acceler-\nation measured by the GPS. This gives a velocity of 2.7%\ngreater than the InSAR velocity. InSAR velocities can have\nerrors up to 3% in areas of high slope, which tend to can-\ncel out when comparing several InSAR data sets with simi-\nlar imaging geometry (I. Joughin, personal communication,\n2007). This error and changes in acceleration could account\nfor the difference between the GPS and InSAR.\nFor all GPS sites, velocity estimates for the year 1996\nare available from InSAR (Joughin et al., 2003). Compared\nto these earlier estimates, velocities have increased signif-\nicantly. The increases over the 12-year period from early\n1996 to mid-season 2007\/2008 at PC55, PC111, PC171 and\nPS169 are 42%, 36%, 34% and 26% respectively, approx-\nimately a 2 to 3% annual increase. The velocity increases\nat PC55, PC111 and PC171 during 2007 were 6.4, 4.8 and\n4.1% respectively. Thus, over the entire length of PIG, ac-\nceleration during 2007 was considerably larger than over the\n12-year period from 1996 to 2008.\nThe velocity increase of 42% over 12 years at PC55 is\nidentical to that reported by Rignot (2008), from InSAR mea-\nsurements alone, for the area close to the grounding line\n(around 40 km downstream from PC55). The 2007 rate of ac-\nceleration at PC55, of 6.4 over 12 months, is slightly higher\nthan that reported by Rignot (2008), of 8% over 16 months,\nbut this is likely to be due to the difference in time period.\nThis demonstrates that where the GPS measurements and In-\nSAR overlap they are in good agreement despite the differ-\nence in spatial scales. However, the GPS results also demon-\nstrate velocity increases further upstream than has been pos-\nsible using the available InSAR data, which, apart from in\n1996, do not have the spatial coverage to give velocity esti-\nmates further than around 100 km inland on PIG.\n4 Elevation change\nAt each GPS site, we calculated a thinning rate (\u2202th) for the\ncontinuous measurement periods, from the speed in the di-\nrection of flow (u), the vertical speed (w), the surface gradi-\nent in the direction of flow (\u2202xh) and the rate of accumulation\n(a) using the kinematic boundary condition\n\u2202th+ u\u2202xh\u2212 w = a. (1)\nContributions to uncertainty in the calculated thinning rates\narise from GPS measurements of u and w (\u00b11%); the stan-\ndard error in the surface gradient measurement (from the\nGPS profiles \u00b17\u20139%) and the variation in the accumulation\nrate. Accumulation was measured against snow stakes at\nPC55 and PC111, giving 0.99 and 1.06 ma\u22121 respectively.\nFig. 2. Rates of elevation change from GPS measurements, laser\naltimetry (Appendix A) and radar altimetry (Shepherd et al., 2002).\nThese accumulation measurements agree closely with mean\nvalues from five 20 m ice cores taken at PC111, PC171 and\nsites in between during the 2006\/2007 and 2007\/2008 sea-\nsons. From these cores we calculate a standard deviation in\nthe annual accumulation rate of \u00b120%.\nThere is a decrease in surface elevation during both sea-\nsons at all the GPS sites. This can be compared with ele-\nvation change derived for the same sites using satellite laser\naltimetry, calculated by us from ICESat data (Appendix A),\nfor the period 2003\u20132007 (Fig. 2). For the ICESat elevation\nchanges we have calculated errors due to the measurements\nnot being at the same location as the GPS stations, using the\nstandard deviation in the ICESat estimates over a 10 km ra-\ndius. Taking ICESat elevation change values along a 10 km\nprofile, perpendicular to, and crossing, the ice stream cen-\nterline shows that there is no significant elevation change\nbias due to the GPS points being located along this center-\nline. We compare these ICESat elevation changes to those\nderived from satellite radar altimetry for the period 1991\u2013\n2001 (Shepherd et al., 2002) (Fig. 2). Figure 2 shows that\nthe thinning is increasing, and that it is strongest close to\nthe grounding line. Our analysis of ICESat data is consis-\ntent with the earlier ICESat results presented by Thomas et\nal. (2004b) which showed that during 2004 thinning was ap-\nproximately double that of the 1990s. Current rates of thin-\nning (late 2006 to early 2008) from GPS are even higher at\naround three times greater than in the 1990s.\n5 Relationship between thinning and acceleration\nThe thinning rates (Fig. 2) demonstrate that PIG is steepen-\ning at an increasing rate. The rate of slope increase over the\ncentral region of PIG between PC55 and PC171 was found\nto be approximately constant at 2.06\u00d710\u22125 a\u22121 during the\n2006\/2007 season and 2.28\u00d710\u22125 a\u22121 for 2007\/2008. To ex-\namine the first order relationship between the steepening and\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/3\/125\/2009\/ The Cryosphere, 3, 125\u2013131, 2009\n128 J. B. T. Scott: Increased rate of acceleration on Pine Island Glacier\nacceleration we use a force balance for the glacier where the\ncenterline velocity (u) is given by (van der Veen, 1999)\nu = 2A\nn+ 1H\n(\n\u03c4\u02c6d\n)n ( W\n2H\n)n+1\n, (2)\nwhere, H is ice thickness, W is ice-stream width, and A and\nn are material properties describing ice flow. Here, \u03c4\u02c6d , is the\neffective driving stress which is a combination of the gravi-\ntational driving stress, \u03c4d , the basal drag, \u03c4b, and the gradient\nin longitudinal stress. Implicitly, we have assumed that basal\nshear stress is independent of width and that horizontal stress\ngradients are small compared to both side and basal drag.\nThese assumptions are made to provide a first order analy-\nsis and are a starting point for evaluating the potential effects\nof slope changes on centerline velocity. A similar model was\napplied by Joughin et al. (2003) and by Thomas et al. (2004a)\nfor estimation of basal stress.\nWe apply Eq. (2) to the average geometry over the 116-\nkm central flowline of PIG between PC55 and PC171, calcu-\nlating the gravitational driving stress from the surface slope\n(\u03b1=\u22120.00135), ice density (\u03c1=917 kg m\u22123), gravitational ac-\nceleration (g=9.81 ms\u22122) and ice thickness (H=1860 m) us-\ning\n\u03c4d = \u2212\u03c1gH sin\u03b1, (3)\nto give, \u03c4d=22.6 kPa. From our strain rate measurements\nat PC55 and PC171 we calculate the longitudinal stresses,\ngiving a net stress due to longitudinal stress gradients of\n\u22121.5 kPa for this region, approximately 7% of the magnitude\nof the gravitational driving stress and acting in the opposite\ndirection. We use n=3 and A=2.9\u00d710\u221216 s\u22121 kPa\u22123, corre-\nsponding to a depth-averaged temperature of \u221215\u25e6C (Pater-\nson, 1994), and estimate an average W=44 km. From the\nspeed at PC111, approximately the midpoint of this section\nof flowline, accounting for the additional resistance from the\nlongitudinal stress gradient, from Eq. (2) we calculate a basal\ndrag of 3.6 kPa. This is low compared to the driving stress\nand therefore our use of Eq. (2) as a first order model is fur-\nther justified.\nWith an initial assumption that basal drag and longitudinal\nstress gradients do not change, we analyse the sensitivity of\nvelocity to changes in gravitational driving stress alone. We\nalso assume ice thickness (H ) to be constant. This approxi-\nmation works because changes in absolute thickness have an\norder of magnitude less effect on the driving stress than the\nsurface slope changes over this period. These assumptions\nare made only in order to assess whether these changes in\ndriving stress are sufficient to account for the rates of accel-\neration observed over this portion of the ice stream. Substi-\ntuting Eqs. (3) into (2), differentiating with respect to time,\nand noting that \u03b1\u001c1, we find\n\u2202tu = D.u((n\u22121)\/n).(\u2202t\u03b1), (4)\nFig. 3.

(5)\nThe average rate of slope increase (\u2202t\u03b1) between the same\npoints for 1991\u20132001 was 0.60\u00d710\u22125 a\u22121 (from satellite\nradar altimetry: Shepherd et al., 2002) and for 2003\u20132007\nwas 1.15\u00d710\u22125 a\u22121 (calculated by us from ICESat laser al-\ntimetry data). For the periods over which we have GPS mea-\nsurements, the directly calculated values of \u2202tu and u can be\nused. For earlier periods the average rate of velocity increase\n(\u2202tu) can be estimated for the central point (PC111). This is\ndone by subtracting the annual percentage accelerations esti-\nmated by InSAR (Joughin et al., 2003; Rignot, 2006), and ac-\ncounting for the fact that PC111 has had a lower percentage\nincrease, at 6% less than PC55 over the 12-year period from\n1996. Figure 3 shows the data, paired values of \u2202tu plot-\nted against u2\/3\u2202t\u03b1. The best fit gives D=25 400 (ma2)1\/3\nwith an R2 coefficient of determination of 0.99. When calcu-\nlated using the estimated values for ice stream width and the\nmaterial parameters given above, D=27 600 (ma2)1\/3. How-\never, this small difference is within the uncertainties in the\nparameters and could be achieved simply by changing W\nfrom 44 km to 41 km in Eqs. (4) and (5). The strength of\nthe correlation with the acceleration (Fig. 3) is entirely due to\nthe slope changes, and hence changes in gravitational driving\nstress, this is because u2\/3 increases by only 19% over this\ntime period, which would not give a significant correlation,\nwhilst \u2202t\u03b1 increases by 271%. We conclude that available\nobservations over the past 18 years conform to this simple\nmodel and relate the surface slope increases directly to ac-\nceleration along this section of PIG.

The lack of tidal velocity modulation gives more con-\nfidence in velocities estimated from InSAR processing and\nincreases confidence that comparison of InSAR and GPS ve-\nlocities is reasonable.\nFor the 2006\/2007 season the accelerations at all sites were\napproximately constant; that is, after removing a constant ac-\nceleration component from the flow-direction displacements\nthe residual displacements were around GPS error levels.\nHowever, for the 2007\/2008 season, after removing a con-\nstant acceleration component, significant residuals remained\nat PC55 and PC111. Residuals at PC171 and PS169 were\nsmaller than those at PC111 by a factor of 5, and than those\nat PC55 by a factor of 15. These residuals were therefore\nclose to noise level, and along with the shorter observation\nperiods at PC171, and PS169, meant that analysis was not\npossible. For easy comparison between PC55 and PC111,\nthe residuals have been normalized by the total horizontal\ndisplacement at each station and are displayed in Fig. 4.\nThe short term changes at PC55 and PC111 are closely\nmatched (Fig. 4). We cannot identify a phase-shift between\nthe two curves due to GPS noise, hence the response effec-\ntively appears instantaneous. However, we estimate an un-\ncertainty of two days. These short-term acceleration changes\nobserved at PC55 and PC111 were not accompanied by any\nfluctuations in the vertical positions of the stations, signify-\ning no coincident fluctuations in gravitational driving stress.\nHowever, there were fluctuations in the strain rate, and hence\nchanges in the longitudinal stress gradient between the two\nstations, with the same time period as the fluctuations in ac-\nceleration observed individually at each station. Therefore\nthese changes in acceleration have been transmitted instan-\ntaneously by longitudinal stresses. The perturbations may\noriginate from the grounding line, ice shelf or from changes\nin the basal conditions, including the movement of subglacial\nwater. However, these fluctuations in the longitudinal stress\ngradient are at a lower order of magnitude than the longer\nterm increases in driving stress.\nFig. 4. Horizontal inline flow-direction positions for PC55 and\nPC111 de-trended by a quadratic (constant acceleration component\nremoved) and normalized by dividing by the total distance travelled\nin one day at each location.\n7 Discussion\nThe GPS measurements reveal that the rates of acceleration\nexperienced in 2007, which are higher than any previous\nmeasurements have shown on PIG, extend far inland. At\nthe downstream end of PIG, the acceleration reached at least\n6.4% a\u22121 in 2007, but it was also 4.8 and 4.1% a\u22121 at dis-\ntances of 111 and 171 km, from the grounding line, respec-\ntively. This upstream acceleration is at a greater percentage\nrate than any estimates prior to 2006 for the downstream end\nof the glacier (Rignot, 2006). The current high acceleration\nphase of PIG may have started in 2002, there is little accel-\neration from 2001 to 2002 followed by very high accelera-\ntion from 2002 onwards (Rignot, 2006). But even if it started\naround 1996 (Joughin et al., 2003) and the perturbation caus-\ning this acceleration originated at the downstream end of the\nglacier it is likely that it has been transmitted rapidly up-\nstream, by a diffusion process, faster than the 10 years per\n100 km suggested by the model of Payne et al. (2004). The\nreduction in the percentage velocity increases, with distance\nupstream, suggests that the perturbation could originate at\nthe downstream end of the glacier, but modelling is needed\nto verify this.\nCurrent rates of thinning are higher than over the previ-\nous two decades. If the exceptionally high thinning rates\ncontinue they could contribute to ungrounding of the weakly\ngrounded ice plain and further acceleration (Thomas et al.,\n2004a; Payne et al., 2004). The section of PIG, 55 to 171 km\ninland, is steepening at a rate which provides an increase in\ndriving stress of sufficient magnitude to produce the observed\nacceleration. There does not necessarily need to have been\na sustained increase in longitudinal stress gradient or reduc-\ntion in basal drag over this region of the glacier to explain\nthe current force imbalance. However, we have measured\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/3\/125\/2009\/ The Cryosphere, 3, 125\u2013131, 2009\n130 J. B. T. Scott: Increased rate of acceleration on Pine Island Glacier\nchanges in the longitudinal stress gradients that are transmit-\nted rapidly along the glacier causing fluctuations in the ac-\nceleration over short periods at sites 56 km apart. It is likely\nthat perturbations transmitted initially by longitudinal stress\ngradients cause the acceleration inland (Payne et al., 2004;\nThomas et al., 2004a).\n8 Conclusions\nThe GPS measurements on PIG augment those obtained from\nremote sensing. They demonstrate that rates of thinning and\nacceleration are both increasing and that this extends at least\n171 km inland. Acceleration is highly correlated to slope in-\ncrease and no sustained increase in longitudinal stress gradi-\nent, or decrease in basal drag, is needed to explain the force\nbalance. Transmission of the acceleration inland has been\nexceptionally fast at around 200 km per decade, or possibly\neven quicker. The results are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat changes in PIG result from changes at the downstream\nend, including the grounding area and floating ice shelf. It\nappears that PIG is not only out of balance but continues to\nmove further out of balance. If there is a feedback process,\nwhere downstream thinning causes further ungrounding and\nacceleration, then this could result in a major retreat of the\nice stream.\nAppendix A\nBrief summary of ICESat processing\nWe use a 10 km radius around the GPS location to calculate\nthe errors in the ICESat elevation change presented in this pa-\nper. This in every case incorporates several hundred ICESat\nelevation change values over the period 2003\u20132007 to give an\naverage rate of change for this period. It makes the ICESat\nmeasurements more comparable with the previous ERS ele-\nvation change measurements, which have a much lower spa-\ntial resolution. Over this spatial range there is no bias caused\nby moving away from the glacier centerline. Therefore the\nerrors are also valid when comparing the ICESat measure-\nment to the current GPS measurements which are taken along\nthe centerline.\nWe used ICESat GLA12 Release 28 data (Zwally et al.,\n2007) from 2003 up to November 2007. We fitted planar sur-\nfaces to parallel tracks of point height and date measurements\nthat are close in space (300 m) and time (2 years). We then\ndifferenced the height and date of later point measurements\nthat overlap these interpolated surfaces, giving us 1h\/1t .\nWe repeated this process for all possible combinations of in-\nterpolated and overlapping tracks that fit our criteria. We\nestimate the uncertainty in our 1h\/1t to be \u00b10.07 ma\u22121 at\nthe 1-sigma level.\nA1 Methods\nA1.1 Interpolation\nWe used ICESat GLA12 Release 28 data (Zwally et al.,\n2007) (at the highest calibration level 4), for all available\nyears from 2003 up to November 2007. To quantify elevation\nchange, we began by grouping ICESat height measurements\ninto two-year epochs (2003\u20132004, 2004\u20132005, 2005\u20132006\nor 2006\u20132007). We interpolated surfaces between all ele-\nvation measurements in an epoch that have two neighbours\nlying within 300 m distance, using triangular irregular net-\nworks (TINs). This ensures an interpolation distance never\ngreater than 260 m, typically much shorter. For compari-\nson, crossover analysis interpolates over \u223c172 m and uses\nfour points rather than our three. Our scheme produces long,\nribbon-like, linearly-interpolated surfaces between closely-\nspaced, near-parallel tracks representing surface height for\neach epoch. To account for the difference in timing of the\nmeasurements, we performed the same interpolation on ac-\nquisition date.\nWhere these ribbon TINs were crossed by ground-track\nfootprints from a later or earlier epoch, we extracted the\ninterpolated elevation and acquisition date from the TIN at\nthe new sample-point. This yields comparable elevation\nmeasurements: one interpolated, one measured precisely\n(crossover analysis compares pairs of interpolated heights),\nfrom which we calculated 1h\/1t . We repeated this for all\npossible date combinations forwards and backwards in time.\nThe interval, 1t , ranges from 1 to 4.5 years, mean 728 days\nover Antarctica. Within a given epoch, this approach as-\nsumes linear elevation change both spatially between adja-\ncent points, and through time. It sacrifices temporal resolu-\ntion to gain spatial coverage.\nA1.2 Uncertainty estimate\nOur 1h\/1t measurements are derived from height mea-\nsurements largely corrected for pointing and saturation\nerrors. We believe the residual uncertainty (1-sigma)\nis <0.1 m (http:\/\/nsidc.org\/data\/icesat\/detailed disclaimer.\nhtml#SatCorrNote). We assume forward scattering error to\nbe temporally uncorrelated, affecting either the earlier or\nlater data in a 1h\/1t measurement, and so becomes random\nin sign. We filter out 1h\/1t measurements that are anoma-\nlous relative to a large neighbourhood and assume a remain-\ning forward-scattering uncertainty of 0.1 m (1-sigma). Our\n1h\/1t measurements come from combinations of typically\n3 from 14 orbit periods assumed independent in error. From\nthis budget, we estimate the combined 1h\/1t uncertainty in\nour measurements to be \u00b10.07 ma\u22121 at the 1-sigma level.\nThe Cryosphere, 3, 125\u2013131, 2009 www.the-cryosphere.net\/3\/125\/2009\/\nJ.
