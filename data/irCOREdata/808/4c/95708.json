Nevertheless, \nthey also continue to engage, both pragmatically and in ritual contexts, with a landscape \nthat they experience and describe as full of spirits and energies. As an example of this, I \nconsider a ritual to renew the fertility of a river feeding into wet-rice fields. Despite \nattempts by the Catholic Church to \u2018inculturate\u2019 the faith in Manggarai, many people \nadopt an attitude best described as anti-syncretism, in which they reject the possibility of \na fully Catholic landscape. I argue that the resilience of this anti-syncretic spiritual \nlandscape can be explained both by the particular nature of the Catholic mission on \nFlores, and by local adherence to a strict separation of \u2018religion\u2019 (agama) from the \n\u2018custom\u2019 (adat) associated with the land. Drawing on recent literature reviving the \nconcept of animism, I suggest that Manggarai people\u2019s engagements with their spiritual \nlandscape are a form of \u2018agricultural animism\u2019. However, like all animisms, this has a \nspecific history, including responses to shifts in spiritual potency occasioned by state-\nsponsored resettlement. \n \nKey words: Manggarai; Landscape; Catholicism; Animism; Anti-Syncretism. \n \n \n 2\nThe landscape of southern Manggarai, in the west of the Indonesian island of Flores, is \none of both extraordinary beauty and hard-working endeavour. High mountains, \nfrequently shrouded in cloud, encircle highland villages where houses cluster amongst \nsteep fields and coffee trees. Painstakingly-constructed stone roads weave past lowland \nvillages, schools and a large, concrete Catholic church. Rivers and streams descend down \nsteep ravines to the lowlands, where water is diverted to feed wet-rice fields. This varied \nterrain can be read for the visible signs of history: of village expansion and relocation, of \nmissionisation and school-building, of road-construction and wet-rice cultivation. \nHowever, for the Manggarai people who inhabit, move through and engage with this \nlandscape, it is not a text to be read, nor a setting against which human life unfolds. \nRather, the landscape is intrinsic to their being-in-the-world, it is a \u2018lived environment\u2019 \n(Ingold 2000), one constituted and animated by kinship connections, ancestral journeys \nand, as this paper will describe, potent spiritual energies.1\n \nThroughout Southeast Asian history, people have engaged with the landscape as a dense \nrealm of spirits and forces (see Introduction to this issue). The inhabitants of the region of \nsouthern Manggarai are no exception in this regard. However, what is both relatively \nunusual and interesting about their situation in the contemporary Southeast Asian context \nis the degree to which Manggarai people have resisted either a \u2018purification\u2019 of spiritual \nforces from the land (see Howell and Amster, this issue), or a syncretic landscape that \ncombines Catholic and ancestral\/ indigenous elements (Bovensiepen, this issue). In this \npaper I describe attempts by the Catholic Church to \u2018inculturate\u2019 the faith on Flores, and \nthe generally negative response by many Manggarai people I know to such efforts. I \nargue that the concept of anti-syncretism is helpful for understanding the attitude of many \nManggarai villagers to inculturation, and that such anti-syncretism is in part influenced \nby Indonesian discourses on the separation of \u2018religion\u2019 (agama) and \u2018culture\/ tradition\u2019 \n(adat). However, rather than focusing only on the general rejection of an inculturated \nlandscape, I go further and try to understand why local perceptions of an animated and \nenergised landscape have been so resilient. Following recent work re-conceptualising the \nconcept of animism (Bird-David 1999), I argue that we can best approach such \nperceptions as a form of \u2018agricultural animism\u2019 in which, by contrast with hunter-gatherer \n 3\nanimisms, reciprocal relationships with fertile land and water (rather than with animals) \nare central. However, though resilient, this animistic attitude is not unchanging, and I \ntherefore indicate the ways in which it has been adapted in response to changes in \nsettlement patterns and agricultural practice. \n \nIngold, in his work on dwelling and livelihood, has stressed how human environments are \nnot neutral backdrops to activity, an external world of \u2018nature\u2019 which people need to \n\u2018grasp\u2019 conceptually (2000, 42). Against what he calls \u2018the logic of construction\u2019, Ingold \ninstead emphasises the fundamental historicity of our environments, \u2018forged through the \nactivities of living beings\u2019 and continually emerging \u2018in the process of our lives\u2019 (2000, \n20). As mentioned in the Introduction to this issue, this perspective is a striking contrast \nto theoretical approaches to landscapes as \u2018cultural constructs\u2019 or \u2018ways of seeing\u2019. In this \npaper, I broadly follow such a phenomenological approach (which has also been central \nto the new work on animism), and try to show how Manggarai people do not project \nideas or concepts of spirits and energies onto a \u2018physical landscape\u2019, but engage \npractically with an energised landscape in the course of their daily lives and work. The \nManggarai landscape is experienced by its human inhabitants as having agency, the most \nobvious example of which being when people call out \u2018there are people here!\u2019 as the \nground shakes beneath them during an earthquake. Nevertheless, despite their practical \nengagements with a landscape of spirits and energies, at times people are also able to step \nback and offer commentary on its significance. Indeed, such critical commentary on \nwhether, for example, the land can talk, is one of the major consequences of people\u2019s \ninvolvement with a world religion. \n \nCatholicism, Diversity and Spirits \n \nAlthough there has been a Catholic presence in east Flores since the sixteenth century, \nCatholicism was not introduced to Manggarai, in the west of the island, until the late \n1920s. With the exception of Muslim fishing villages dotted along the coast and on off-\nshore islands, the majority of Manggarai people today strongly identify as Catholic. \nChildren are baptised as babies and receive first communion during their primary \n 4\nschooling. Couples marry in church in addition to village-based rituals, most people try to \nobserve Sunday as a day of rest, and many people are interested in discussing the life of \nJesus. However, beyond this fundamental, and strongly felt, identity, there is considerable \ndiversity of practice and discourse. In villages in southern Manggarai, people vary widely \nin the regularity of their attendance at church and prayer meetings, and in their attitudes \ntowards older ritual practices usually categorised under the heading of \u2018custom\/ tradition\u2019 \n(adat) or \u2018chicken speech\u2019 (tura manuk).  \n \nAs Cannell has stressed, an understanding of specific Catholicisms necessitates an \nintegrated account of both the impact of changes in Vatican policy and \u2018the distinct \nhistories of the different religious orders and their varied relationships to forms of \nreligious practice\u2019 (2006, 22). The missionaries who first converted the population of \nManggarai were members of the SVD (Society of the Divine Word), a missionary society \nnoted for its study of local languages and cultures, and its links with the journal \nAnthropos. Steenbrink\u2019s history of Catholics in Indonesia describes the SVD as \n\u2018pragmatic organizers\u2019, who put less emphasis than other missions on a \u2018specific style of \nspirituality\u2019 (2007, 558). In Flores, the SVD fathers considered what they called the \n\u2018traditional religion\u2019 to be \u2018a deficient religion, but not\u2026 a completely negative factor\u2019 \n(Steenbrink 2007, 143), since its study would lead to traces of belief in the \u2018Supreme \nBeing\u2019 (see Verheijen 1951). Foreshadowing later church interests in local culture, the \nfirst Bishop of Manggarai, Mgr Wilhelmus van Bekkum, instituted the notorious \u2018Buffalo \nMass\u2019, fusing Catholicism with traditional sacrifice. He was, though, part of a \u2018radical \nminority\u2019, and other priests were more forthright in viewing Manggarai sacrificial \npractices as \u2018un-Catholic\u2019 (Erb 2006, 212-3). Nevertheless, and in part because of the \ndistinctly \u2018anthropological\u2019 interests of the SVD, the church in Manggarai has clearly \nlacked the kind of explicit, integrated project of \u2018purification\u2019 described by Keane (2007) \nfor Dutch Calvinists on Sumba.  \n \nSince respect for customary law and rituals (adat) \u2018has varied very much from priest to \npriest\u2019 (Erb 2006, 210), there is wide variation throughout the Manggarai region in the \nfrequency and manner of sacrificial rituals. In the area of southern Manggarai with which \n 5\nI am familiar, even regular attendees at the Deng\u00e9 church still speak of the fertile power \nof spirits and ancestors. In parishes to the west of Deng\u00e9, where many lay catechists \n(guru agama or \u2018religious teachers\u2019) practise a form of Catholicism known as karismatik, \nmany people do not hold agricultural rituals. Though such karismatik Catholics might kill \na chicken for a life-cycle ritual in a house, they will not inspect its stomach or throw food \nfor ancestral spirits.2 However, in the Deng\u00e9 parish in which I have worked, only a few \npeople are rumoured to be karismatik. Most others still hold rituals for a range of events, \ninspect auguries, and offer up food and betel to spirits. This is partly because the previous \npriest of the parish appears to have had few problems with adat ritual procedures, so long \nas people also attended church and had their children baptised. The current priest, though \nhe does not attend the sacrificial element of communal rituals, also seems to have a rather \ntolerant attitude. \n \nThus, as in other contexts where Christianity has not been adopted \u2018under exclusivist \nconstraints\u2019, but has become \u2018a matter of enculturation and education\u2019 (Anderson 2003, \n128), people remain open to and interested in a variety of understandings and practices. \nAlthough occasionally, during discussions about spirits, someone might look \nembarrassed and tell me such things were kafir (\u2018pagan\u2019), this is a minority view. Most \nManggarai people I know take seriously the existence of a range of spirits and invisible \nenergies. Non-human persons are often referred to as \u2018people on the other side\u2019 (ata pal\u00e9-\nsina) and, as such, are thought to occupy a different dimension, the counterpart to human \nlife on this side. People say of such spirits that \u2018they can see us, but we can\u2019t see them\u2019, a \nform of definition common throughout Southeast Asia (see Rafael 1993, 111-115). This \ninvisibility is the case even though, as one middle-aged woman put it, spirits \u2018live as \nclose together with us as a maize leaf and a maize cob\u2019. \n \nAlthough people often use the generic term poti to refer to spirits, including ancestral \nspirits, at other times they are more interested in speaking of specific types of beings, \nsuch as darat (beautiful, amoral forest spirits), jing (dwarves associated with rocks) and \nempo-d\u00e9hong (spirits who travel at night looking to take heads). Whilst it might be \ntempting to focus on spirit classification as part of an over-arching cosmology, I find the \n 6\nnotion of a spiritual landscape closer to local understandings and practices. Although \nspirits are conceptualised as unseen interlocutors, for Manggarai people such spirits \nanimate and merge with a material landscape of energies, effects and practical \nconsequences. The boundary between spirits and spirit-places is not clear-cut. Certain, \nnamed fields, particularly those through which streams flow, are rather generally \nassociated with harmful spirits (poti) and, as amongst the Nage of Central Flores, can be \nsaid to have \u2018acquired a reputation\u2019 (Forth 1998, 66). Fear of offending these spirits or \nspirit-places often necessitates avoidance behaviour, such as not exclaiming or shouting \nloudly, not drinking water from the stream, and not letting children play. However, what \nis significant is that, having described the kinds of precautions that should be taken \nagainst such spirits, many people went on to stress to me that they were \u2018really\/ actually \nthe land\u2019 (tana muing). In 2001, two schoolgirls drowned in a relatively shallow lowland \nstream, and their deaths were universally interpreted as the result of the actions of the \nstream\u2019s poti. The teacher who discovered the children, who is a devout Catholic and \noften leads the hymns in church, told me that this poti was \u2018really the land\u2019 (tana muing), \nimplying that the land and its places have a force of their own. Therefore, to understand \nManggarai engagements with spirits, it is important not to separate out \u2018spirit-beings\u2019 \nfrom the wider landscape of places and pathways. \n \nThis spiritual landscape of seen and unseen realms has everyday consequences for \nhumans who engage with it as a lived world. As Harvey has stressed for the Peruvian \nAndes, the relationship with an animate landscape is not one of thoughtful reflection or \ncontemplation, but is instead pragmatic and practical (2001, 199). A Manggarai person \nwho accidentally injures a wild animal\u2014particularly an eel\u2014is always encouraged to \nconfess this to a healer, who will then make protective medicine. Though I never received \nan explicit explanation of this, people seemed to be suggesting that an eel might be the \ntemporary material form taken by a particular place-spirit, and therefore harming it would \nput a person at risk of spiritual attack.3 Similarly, a person who becomes tired or ill after \nvisiting certain fields, or going to the spring at dusk, is often said to have had a \u2018meeting\u2019 \n(sumang) with an unseen forest- or other place-spirit. Such spirits may have their own \npaths through fields that require ritual \u2018blocking\u2019 at harvest-time. Resting during one \n 7\nexhausting walk to the highlands with my friend Nina, she told me not to actually sit on \nthe path, but to sit to one side so that poti (spirits) could still walk along it without \ndisturbing us.  \n \nConnections between variously defined or acknowledged \u2018spirits\u2019 (who might sometimes \nbe said to \u2018really\u2019 be the land) and the landscape are also seen with regard to different \nkinds of ancestral spirit. Human ancestors (empo) in southern Manggarai tend not be \nnamed individually or in genealogies but are a generalised category connected with the \nmountains, the protection afforded by certain places, and the fertility of the land. As such, \nthey frequently become blurred with spirits known as the \u2018ancestors of the land\u2019 (empo de \ntana). These spirits are imagined as the original owners or inhabitants of the land, and are \naddressed in rituals held in fields, forests or near water sources. One young woman, Regi, \ntold me that the \u2018ancestors of the land\u2019 (empo de tana) were different from \u2018ancestors \nwho are dead people\u2019 (empo ata mata) but that she didn\u2019t exactly know how. Her brother \nremarked on another occasion that the ancestors of the land were rather like \u2018officials\u2019 \n(pegawai) who \u2018guard\u2019 (jaga) key sites in the landscape. This use of the language of the \nstate to describe guardian spirits is intriguing, particularly since there is almost no use of \nthe language of the church in such contexts. My informants are aware that more critical \nCatholics disparage sacrificial rituals for being held pina na\u00e9ng, \u2018anywhere and \neverywhere\u2019. However, this perceived criticism is answered by stressing the precise, \nnamed aspects of the spiritual landscape addressed in ritual: \u2018we don\u2019t hold them at just \nany tree or stone,\u2019 said one woman, \u2018the empo tell us where\u2019. \n \n\u2018What the Land Wants\u2019: A Water Ritual \n \nWater is an intrinsic part of the Manggarai landscape, since the word tana refers not \nsimply to the earth, but also to rivers and streams. Similarly, James Fox argues that \nAustronesian societies regard water as \u2018fundamental to, and in many instances coterminus \nwith, any specification of a landscape\u2019 (1997, 7). Streams and rivers draw our attention to \nthe flows and movement of the landscape, as does the sea, the source of many powerful \nbeings in other, more seaward-oriented eastern Indonesian contexts (Pannell 2007). \n 8\nWater in Manggarai is described as a source of fertility and of a kind of life-giving \u2018oil\u2019 \n(mina). Like the fertility of land, in Manggarai the fertility of water needs to be ensured \nthrough blood sacrifices. \n \nIn the lowland administrative area (desa) of Satar Lenda, at the side of the river of Wae \nAw\u00e9ng, and some 300 metres inland from the sea, a large cross marks the site of a small \ndam and concrete channels. Here, water flowing down from the highland village of Wae \nRebo is diverted towards the wet-rice fields constructed in a 1970s state development \nproject, and today shared between various lowland villages. In April 2001, these villages \ngathered livestock, rice, saucepans and personnel for a large communal ritual to renew \nthe fertility of this water source, following years of declining productivity in the rice \nfields. Upstream from the cross and dam, a group of male elders, joined by the Camat \n(head of the subdistrict, kecamatan) and other state officials, listened to a ritual speech \nand witnessed the sacrifice of a buffalo, several pigs, and a number of chickens. They \nwere watched by a large crowd of villagers, standing on the banks of the river. \n \nLike other sacrificial rituals in fields or the forest, this Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual was described \nas being \u2018what the land wants\u2019 (ngo\u00e9ng de tana). According to my informants, when \nwork was first begun on the Wae Aw\u00e9ng dam in the 1970s, a large boulder obstructed the \nproposed path of a water channel. This unwieldy object could only be moved after the \noriginal (human) owner of the land promised to sacrifice a buffalo in the future. In 2001, \nit was felt that this debt was finally being called in by the land. This was shown by a \nnumber of \u2018signs\u2019 (tanda), such as the descendants of the original owner being repeatedly \nbitten by ticks, and the ritual leaders of the land becoming ill. These \u2018signs\u2019 convinced \nvarious ritual leaders of the need to honour the earlier promise of a buffalo sacrifice. The \ndeclining productivity of the rice fields was directly linked with the failure in the past to \nhold this ritual. \u2018We\u2019ve been eating food from this land for a long time,\u2019 one man told \nme, \u2018now we need to give respect, or we are scared the land will be dry (maha) and hot \n(kolap)\u2019.4\n \n 9\nProcedures for the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual engaged with a spiritual landscape of multiple \nagents and energies. Chickens were sacrificed in the rice fields to invite the \u2018spirits\u2019 (poti-\npoti) from the individual plots to the ritual at the river. Elders and ritual speakers who \nattended from Wae Rebo described themselves as bringing down with them \u2018the souls of \nthe old ancestors in the past\u2019 (wakar data tu\u2019a empo danong), and stressed that although \nthese ancestors are buried in the mountains, they will travel to the lowlands for \nsignificant events. The night before the buffalo sacrifice, small rituals were also held \noutside family rooms in each house in the villages involved. These were to \u2018collect \ntogether souls\u2019 (hilir wakar), to ensure that no human souls followed the spirits or the \nbuffalo to \u2018the other side\u2019. People were also warned not to kill any eels in rivers or \nstreams at this time, since these might be \u2018ancestors\u2019 (empo) on the move to the ritual. In \naddition, for the three days following the ritual, people were forbidden to enter their rice-\nfields, since during this time ancestral and other spirits would be \u2018going to do farming \nwork\u2019 (ngo duat). In the final section of this paper, I will suggest that such a ritual \ndemonstrates the specifically agricultural nature of Manggarai \u2018animism\u2019. However, \nbefore drawing out the kind of environmental conversations that these practices involve, I \nwant to address in more detail the issue of the involvement of Catholicism in this spiritual \nlandscape. \n \nInculturation, Land and Anti-Syncretism \n \nSince the 1960s, the impact of Vatican Two has seen a number of initiatives by the \nCatholic church on Flores to \u2018deepen the faith\u2019 through processes of \u2018inculturation\u2019 or \n\u2018contextualization\u2019, integrating the Gospel with local \u2018culture\u2019 (Barnes 1992, 171; Erb \n2006, 213). Such initiatives mirror post-Vatican Two strategies throughout the Catholic \nworld (Cannell 2006, 25), which have involved a complex series of conversations with \nnotions of culture, ethnicity and locality (Orta 2004). Although \u2018inculturation\u2019 on Flores \nattempts to be \u2018more accommodating and tolerant towards local customs and practices\u2019 \n(Molnar 1997, 403), it is, as Orta\u2019s work on Bolivia reminds us, \u2018an ideology of \nconversion\u2019, involving the \u2018pastoral pruning\u2019 or \u2018purifying\u2019 of local practices (2006, 176). \nIn Manggarai, the most successful initiative has been the production of a book of \n 10\n\u2018Christian songs\u2019, Dere Serani, which uses both the Manggarai language and the rhythms \nand cadences of more traditional songs. More contentiously, there have also been moves \nto create inculturated Catholic places. For example, in the coastal village of Borik in \nsouthern Manggarai, an inculturated chapel has been built in the style of a traditional, \ncircular house, complete with drums hanging from a central post. Though this chapel is \ncertainly found interesting by local people, many of my own informants seem puzzled by \nthe presence of drums in a Catholic place, since drums are used in communal rituals to \nawaken ancestral and other spirits. In addition to inculturated chapels, crosses have also \nbeen built at key sites such as water sources. On a visit to another village, Lamba, young \npeople told me excitedly of their plans to construct a Catholic grotto on top of the \nsompang, a circular stone platform found on the village yard of most old villages and \nassociated with spiritual potency.  \n \nIn my own highland fieldsite of Wae Rebo, and its connected lowland sites, people have \nso far resisted any such attempts to create syncretic places. This is largely because the \nritual leader (tu\u2019a adat), Am\u00e9 Dorus, has very strong opinions about the \u2018mixing\u2019 of \nreligion (agama) and \u2018custom\u2019 (adat) in this manner. When I talked with him about the \nplans in Lamba, he reacted angrily and unfavourably, arguing that the Lamba villagers \nwould regret such a move in the future. He implied that they were putting themselves at \nrisk of illness and infertility caused by the displeasure of ancestral and other spirits. What \nis interesting is that Am\u00e9 Dorus is a relatively devout Catholic, who regularly attends \nprayer meetings and was once also a \u2018religious teacher\u2019 (guru agama). However, like \nmany others, he sees Catholicism as \u2018coming from outside\u2019 (mai p\u00e9\u2019ang mai) and \ntherefore as not applicable to practices concerned with the land, its energies and fertility. \nThis is why he also rejects changes to ritual practice that have occurred in other villages, \nsuch as pronouncing \u2018Yesus Kristus Amin\u2019 at the end of rituals, rather than the usual, \naffirmative chorus of \u2018Ehhhh\u2019. \n \nAs Stewart and Shaw discuss, the concept of syncretism has a somewhat contentious \nhistory within religious studies, since it has often been used to imply either confusion or \n\u2018deviance\u2019 from a \u2018given\u2019 tradition (1994, 5-6). However, embracing the term\u2019s \n 11\ncontentiousness, they suggest the recasting of syncretism as \u2018the politics of religious \nsynthesis\u2019, of which Catholic \u2018inculturation\u2019 strategies are a clear example. Moreover, \nStewart and Shaw argue that we should give as much emphasis to what they term \u2018anti-\nsyncretism\u2019, or the opposition to religious synthesis shown by those \u2018concerned with the \ndefence of religious boundaries\u2019 (1994, 7). This notion of \u2018anti-syncretism\u2019 is extremely \nhelpful in understanding the attitude of Am\u00e9 Dorus and others who, unlike the East \nTimorese villagers described by Bovensiepen (this issue) have not integrated Catholic \nfigures into their spiritual landscape. Though he enjoys inculturated songs, Am\u00e9 Dorus \nabhors the mixing of Catholic language and ritual practice in fields and houses. His \nrejection of syncretic practices such as placing crosses on old stone platforms is not a \nquestion of policing the boundaries between two \u2018religious\u2019 traditions but, rather, \nmaintaining a separation between \u2018religion\u2019 (Catholicism) and practices of ritual and \nnaming that are thoroughly pragmatic and rooted in a historical landscape. Adat, for Am\u00e9 \nDorus, references a holistic phenomenon that is part of the very land itself. Thus, as I will \ndescribe in more detail below, sacrificial rituals are said to be held because they are \u2018what \nthe land wants\u2019 (ngo\u00e9ng de tana). If such rituals were stopped, people would become ill \nsince they could no longer count on the protection of the ancestors and of the powerful \n\u2018energy of the land\u2019 (ghas de tana). To have a fully Catholic landscape, according to \nAm\u00e9 Dorus, one would need to change the name of the land from Manggarai, and change \nthe names of all the hills, rivers, mountains and villages (see Allerton forthcoming). In \nshort, one would have to make it a completely different land. \n \nMany authors have argued that the politically-constrained definition of \u2018religion\u2019 (agama) \nin Indonesia has led most of the country\u2019s ethnic groups to re-conceptualise ritual \npractices in terms of a folkloristic, aestheticised category of \u2018tradition\u2019 (adat) (Acciaioli \n1985; Kipp and Rodgers 1987). However, in southern Manggarai, adat practices retain a \nstrong moral and spiritual force. In keeping matters of adat separate from those of \n\u2018religion\u2019, people have not necessarily accepted an aestheticised (or purified) version of \nthe former (cf. Telle, this issue). Some people I know, aware that Catholicism does not \nencompass all aspects of their life, call themselves \u2018half-half people\u2019 (ata setengah-\nsetengah). A few others take the separation of Catholicism and adat to imply that there \n 12\nare actually \u2018two religions\u2019 (hua agama) and that, in the words of one older man, \u2018We \nmust use them both!\u20195 Further east in Flores, the northern Lio are said to \u2018creatively \nembrace the tripartite categorization of socio-political life\u2019 into the domains of \u2018religion\u2019, \n\u2018government\u2019 and \u2018tradition\u2019 (Howell 2001, 145). Indeed, Howell describes one man, \nMartinus, a retired schoolteacher, devout Catholic and traditional priest-leader, who \nseems to personify the \u2018scrupulous\u2019 attempt at maintaining the boundaries between such \ndomains (2001, 148). Martinus clearly has much in common with Am\u00e9 Dorus, and such \nboundary-maintenance may partly explain many Manggarai people\u2019s distaste for \ninculturation. \n \nA rejection, amongst most of those I know, of overt attempts at the inculturation of either \nplace or ritual means that Catholic rites are often simply \u2018added-on\u2019 to events concerned \nwith the spiritual landscape. Indeed, one man told me that separating adat speech from \nCatholic talk was right since priests taught that \u2018you mustn\u2019t mix pagan talk with that of \nthe angels\u2019 (n\u00e9ka neki sa tombo de kafir agu de anjel). Following the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual \ndescribed above, crowds of villagers walked to a large clearing, where chairs and benches \nhad been lined up beneath a temporary structure of bamboo and tarpaulin. Here, the local \npriest, who had not attended the sacrificial ritual, held an open-air Mass, which included \na speech by Am\u00e9 de Sana, the descendant of the original owner of the lowland fields. \nThis speech gave thanks to God for water, and for all that we receive from him each day. \nAm\u00e9 de Sana also presented the priest with a white chicken, some rice and some money \nin gratitude for holding a Mass at such an event. However, what most engaged the \nattention of those I was accompanying was not the Catholic thanksgiving, but the section \nof Am\u00e9 de Sana\u2019s speech in which his eyes filled with tears as he remembered his father. \nThey told me that this was no doubt because being at the dam site evoked strong \nmemories of his father, who had overseen the dam\u2019s construction, but had died before the \nbuffalo sacrifice could be held.6\n \nHowever, though this kind of structured event, in which adat talk is followed by Catholic \nspeech, maintains an anti-syncretic boundary between \u2018culture\/ tradition\u2019 and \u2018religion\u2019, \nin non-ritual contexts such a boundary is not always considered necessary or important. \n 13\nWe have seen how the southern Manggarai landscape is one that, to its inhabitants, \nalmost seethes with spirits and energies. Many people incorporate Catholic prayers and \nobjects into an armoury of practices protecting them from the more harmful aspects and \nforces of such a landscape. Before embarking on a journey through the forest to the west, \nmy friend\u2019s father insured the spiritual protection of myself and my friend by infusing \nginger for us to eat with his \u2018magic\u2019 (mbeko), but also by marking our foreheads with the \nsign of the cross. Meren, an unmarried woman who lived by herself in a field-hut, \nstressed the potency of her bible and rosario as protective devices. In particular, she \nconsidered these objects to protect her against various spirits (poti), and saw them as \nmore appropriate and more powerful than traditional medicines prepared by healers. She \nand other informants were fond of telling me the story of a European priest who had been \ninvolved with the building of the stone road connecting this area of Manggarai with the \n\u2018Trans-Flores Highway\u2019. They described one area of rocks that had been impossible for \nthe workers to get through, and that only became passable after the priest held a Mass at \nthe site, placating the evil spirits (jing) who had been obstructing the work. This story \ndoes not question the existence of land spirits, but confirms both the personal power of \npriests (who are often said to have strong magic) over spirits, and the more general power \nof Catholicism as a highly-effective means of protection against the spiritual dangers \nimmanent in the landscape. \n \nInterestingly, ideas about the potency of water that influenced the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual have \nbeen particularly ripe ground for Catholic reinterpretations and blessings. When a baby \nenters any house for the first time, people mark its forehead with water and intone, in an \ninformal house baptism \u2018this is your house\u2019 (ho\u2019o mbaru hau). At penti, the Manggarai \n\u2018new year\u2019 fertility ritual, one of the main sites at which sacrifices must be performed is \nthe main spring (wae), where the women of a village collect water. Interestingly, Am\u00e9 \nDorus, the same man who so vociferously rejects syncretic practices, told me that the \npenti ritual was held at the spring so that God would not forget to bless (berkat) the water \nthat the village uses every day. Other villagers told me that although water sources are \noften places associated with more malevolent spirits (poti), the main water source in Wae \nRebo was safe since it had been blessed by a priest. One man who farms a field with a \n 14\nstream associated with a harmful spirit, told me that when he goes to work there he \nalways takes a bottle of water collected from the main village stream. Again, he stressed \nthat this water has been blessed by a priest, showing both the influence of Catholic \nnotions regarding holy water, and the power of Catholic blessing as protection against \nspiritual harm. \n \nAgricultural Animism, Agency and Change \n \nIn this paper, I have been concerned to demonstrate something of the diversity of \nattitudes towards both Catholicism and spirits or spirit-places. Rural Manggarai villagers \ndo not hold one point of view on such issues as inculturation, the existence or description \nof spirits, or the consequences of failing to hold sacrificial rituals. Though many of the \npeople I know reject explicitly syncretic places, at other times they utilise the power of \nCatholic blessings to protect them from spirit-places. Nevertheless, I think it is clear that \ntheirs is a resilient, dense and powerful spiritual landscape that has only marginally been \naffected by their Catholic identity. For example, though people find Catholic holy water \npowerful, it is hard to imagine its substitution for chicken blood in communal rituals, as \nhas occurred in Lamalera (Barnes 1992, 175). Therefore, rather than simply noting the \nlack of either purification or syncretism in this context, I want to go further, and to begin \nto sketch how we might best approach and understand this potent landscape. \n \nRecent anthropological approaches to the resurgent topic of \u2018animism\u2019 have urged a shift \naway from earlier, intellectualist understandings towards both a more phenomenological \napproach and a focus on the environmental sensitivities and relationships that animism \nimplies. Indeed, just as phenomenological approaches to landscape critique the notion of \nlandscape-as-representation, so the new theorists of animism stress that animism is \u2018best \nanalysed as an active way of being in the world, and not merely as a passive \nrepresentation of it\u2019 (Pedersen 2003). For Bird-David, animism is a kind of \n\u2018conversation\u2019 with the environment, a \u2018two-way responsive relatedness\u2019 with trees, \nelephants, rocks or whatever else has \u2018relational affordances\u2019 for the people concerned \n(1999, 77). Similarly, arguing against the characterisation of animism as a \u2018system of \n 15\nbeliefs\u2019, Ingold argues that animism is a \u2018condition of being in\u2019 the world, of being \nsensitive and responsive \u2018in perception and action, to an environment that is always in \nflux\u2019 (2006, 10). Much of this work has stressed how distinctions between nature and \nculture, or between human agents and animals or objects fail to comprehend hunters\u2019 \nconceptions of the world (Nadasdy 2007) and, moreover, have political implications for \nfourth-world communities (Povinelli 1995). \n \nRather than seeing Manggarai understandings of the spiritual landscape as a matter of \n\u2018belief\u2019 or \u2018traditional religion\u2019 (Molnar 1997), I prefer to follow some of the leads of this \nliterature on animism, and to stress how both everyday and ritual activities imply an \nopenness to conversation with the environment as an animate realm of multiple agents. \nAmong many Manggarai people, the landscape is thought to not only communicate signs \nof impending human misfortune\u2014as when a woman interpreted the strange swaying of a \ntree as a sign of her husband\u2019s impending death\u2014but also to give signs of its own needs \n(cf. Amster and Telle, this issue). For example, an elder who is the ritual leader (tu\u2019a \nteno) of a particular, named field (lingko), might notice a spider appearing on the field\u2019s \nritual centre (lodok). Here, the spider proceeds to walk round and round in a circle. This \nspider is one form taken by the mori de tana, the \u2018lord\/ owner of the land\u2019 (included \namongst the \u2018ancestors of the land\u2019) and its circular movements are a \u2018sign\u2019 that the land \nwants to have an uma randang, an agricultural festival involving significant sacrifices \nand the opening up of a number of new fields. I was told that fields should be regularly \nplanted \u2018in case the land should cry\u2019. Similarly, if the land is dug in order to build a new \nhouse without the appropriate rituals being held, the land might cry, \u2018What are you \ndoing? Why are you injuring me?\u2019 When I asked Am\u00e9 Dorus, the ritual leader of Wae \nRebo, if the land could really talk like this, he emphatically replied, \u2018It can talk. Its \nappetite [nafsu]. The appetite of the land. Don\u2019t let anyone say this, that the land doesn\u2019t \nhave an appetite. It does\u2019. \n \nFor Am\u00e9 Dorus and others, the land has agency, expressed in terms of its \u2018appetite\u2019 \n(nafsu). Such understandings are also seen in people\u2019s descriptions of sacrificial rituals, \nincluding that for Wae Aw\u00e9ng, as \u2018what the land wants\u2019 (ngo\u00e9ng de tana). People say \n 16\nthat if they don\u2019t hold rituals, they will be \u2018scared of the accusations of the land\u2019 (rantang \nbabang le tana), accusations which could take the material form of human sickness and \ndeath, or of weak crops and a poor harvest. By contrast, if humans do maintain a \nconversation with the \u2018land\u2019 (which includes its water sources and rivers), if they do \nsatisfy its specific wants and needs, they will receive health and good harvests. Following \nthe sacrifices at the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual, buffalo horns, pig feet and chicken wings were all \nleft on a post by the river, as communicative offerings, or material signs of the ritual \nspeech spoken (see Allerton forthcoming). Moreover, in the days after this ritual, various \nforms of ancestors (empo) came to \u2018do agricultural work\u2019 in the rice-fields. By contrast \nwith people\u2019s conversations with this energetic landscape of spirits, the concrete cross \nnext to the dam seems somewhat static. The problem for many Manggarai people with \nthe idea of a \u2018Catholic landscape\u2019 is that Catholicism does not acknowledge the \n(beneficial) agency of the land itself. Rather, it assumes an essentially passive \nenvironment in which protective signs and symbols can be planted, without ensuring the \ncontinued potency of the land. \n \nThis Manggarai focus on the land and its fertility offers a Southeast Asian agricultural \ncontrast to relationships between animals and hunter-gatherers, which have tended to be \nthe default focus of recent work on animism. Bird-David has herself acknowledged that \n\u2018[a] diversity of animisms exists, each animistic project with its local status, history and \nstructure\u2019 (1999, 79). By contrast with the hunter-gatherer animism that her own article \noutlines, Manggarai \u2018conversations\u2019 with the environment constitute what might be called \na kind of \u2018agricultural animism\u2019. Though, when trees are felled in the forest, rituals are \nheld there for forest spirits, the primary conversations that take place in this context are \nfocused on the fertility of land and water, and the connected health and fertility of \nhumans. Moreover, when people do engage with wild animals, it is predominantly as \nmanifestations of ancestral or land spirits. The ancestral element to this agricultural \nanimism is worth stressing: because the ancestors are buried in the ground, and because \nclear distinctions are not always made between human ancestors and \u2018ancestors of the \nland\u2019, agricultural fertility flows when all forms of ancestors are remembered. It is \ntherefore noteworthy, given the \u2018anti-syncretism\u2019 of the spiritual landscape, that the \n 17\nchurch in rural Manggarai, as amongst the Lio (Howell 2001, 49), has largely left matters \nof death and burial to villagers. In southern Manggarai, there are no church graveyards, \nand the priest has little involvement with most death practices. Though people do hold \nprayer meetings at set intervals after a death, the primary focus of death ritual is a series \nof sacrificial events. The church is therefore left out of the reciprocal relations between \nthe living and the dead that are necessary for fertility. This situation offers a strong \ncontrast to the Sasak village described by Telle (this issue), where Islam is central to the \nplaces and processes of death, and where the ancestral landscape cannot therefore be so \neasily separated from \u2018religion\u2019. \n \nThough Manggarai \u2018agricultural animism\u2019 remains strong it does, as Bird-David\u2019s \ncomment suggests, have a specific history, which involves not only anti-syncretic \nresponses to Catholicism, but also accommodations with state-sponsored resettlement and \nagricultural development. As mentioned, the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual was held to renew the \nrapidly-declining fertility of lowland, wet-rice fields. These fields, and the dam which \nensures the flow of water into them, were constructed by the local Manggarai government \nin a development project in 1972. This project was connected with a resettlement \nprogram in the mid-1960s, when many villages were encouraged to move down from \nolder highland sites to specially-built sites in the lowlands, near to church, school and \nmarket. This resettlement program is referred to by many people in southern Manggarai \nas \u2018transmigration\u2019 (transmigrasi), and can be seen as a state attempt to \u2018make a society \nlegible\u2019 (Scott 1998, 2). Only one village in this area, Wae Rebo, refused to abandon its \nhighland site, though it did establish a lowland site, Kombo, in which at least half of its \ninhabitants now spend most of their time.7 The land on which both Kombo and the wet-\nrice fields was built was donated by families from the village of Lenggos, who were the \nacknowledged owners of the land in the lowlands. \n \nThis partial or complete resettlement in the lowlands, and the introduction of wet-rice \nagriculture, have both involved consequences for people\u2019s relationship with the spiritual \nlandscape. For example, Wae Rebo villagers do not hold any large-scale communal \nrituals in their lowland site of Kombo. They explain this with reference to the donated \n 18\nland on which Kombo is built, and with which the original owners retain a connection. \nWhilst the inhabitants of Kombo may legally own their house-plots, they say they do not \nhave any ritual \u2018rights\u2019 (hak) over the land. In particular, the ancestors (empo) of the \ncommunity are thought to reside in the mountain site of Wae Rebo though, as we saw for \nthe Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual, they may be invited to travel down for specific events. For people \nsuch as Am\u00e9 Dorus, this situation means that the lowland village of Kombo, despite \nbeing over 40 years old, still has a rather temporary status, and why its food \u2018just fills our \nstomachs\u2019 but cannot really \u2018feed us\u2019, in the sense of true, fulfilling nourishment. \n \nIn other words, for the villagers of Wae Rebo-Kombo, and notwithstanding the practical \nbenefits that wet-rice farming has brought about, resettlement has accounted for a marked \ndifference in spiritual potency between highlands and lowlands. Whilst the lowlands do \nnot lack general poti spirits, they do, on an everyday basis, seem to lack ancestral spirits. \nThis situation also partly explains why, although agricultural rituals are very common \noccurrences in the highlands, ritual events have been relatively rare in the context of \nagricultural work in the wet-rice fields. However, undoubtedly another reason for ritual \nabsence in the wet-rice fields is their origin in a government development project. As a \nrelatively recently-introduced technology of farming, wet-rice agriculture lacks the kind \nof ancestral connections of upland, swidden agriculture. Similarly, the planting or \nharvesting of highland coffee trees is also less ritually-marked than the planting and \nharvesting of maize and hill-rice in swiddens. \n \nIn his account of the \u2018ritual, spirit-oriented\u2019 side of Gayo agriculture, John Bowen (1993, \n173-201) describes the ways in which the ambiguities or unspoken aspects of ritual allow \nfor the accommodation of a range of religious positions. He also notes that for many \nmodernist town-dwellers, agricultural rituals are \u2018best construed as entirely social and \ntechnical, with the goal of coordinating farm labor\u2019 (1993, 180). Does this explain the \nuniformed appearance of several state officials at the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual? Though rituals \nin southern Manggarai, unlike in Gayo, are never conducted in Indonesian, there were \naspects of the organisation of the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual that would support a view of it as a \ntechnology of cooperation and coordination. Formal \u2018letters of invitation\u2019 were typed for \n 19\nall teachers and other officials in the local area. Participation in the ritual, both through \nattendance and through financial and other contributions, was compulsory for all families \nwith wet-rice fields fed by Wae Aw\u00e9ng. Even those karismatik Catholics who would not \nnormally organise their own sacrificial events were still required to contribute to the \nevent. At their speeches (in Indonesian) following the Mass, the Camat and other state \nofficials stressed the need for harmony and cooperation between those farming the wet-\nrice fields. People were told not to block water when it was scheduled to flow into a \nneighbour\u2019s field. They were also told to be very careful about accusing others of stealing \nland, since such accusations have led to violent conflict in other areas of Manggarai.  \n \nFor the state officials, though they are respectful towards its participants, and interested \nin its \u2018cultural\u2019 aspects, the Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual was clearly a chance to re-educate the local \npopulation in the techniques of farming, the importance of cooperation and the avoidance \nof conflict. However, for most villagers, the ritual had a rather different significance, and \nshows how perceptions of the landscape and its needs are not unchanging, but may \ninvolve the reassertion of ritual procedures (cf. Bowen 1993, 194). As I described earlier, \nthe inspiration for the ritual came after a number of \u2018signs\u2019 appeared to the original \nowners of the land. It was felt that if these signs were ignored any longer, the land would \nbecome \u2018hot\u2019, something that also occurs when there are land conflicts. Thus, fields, the \nownership and agricultural techniques of which had their origin in a government \ndevelopment project, and that had to a great extent been devoid of ritual, now appeared to \nbe undergoing a re-evaluation. The Wae Aw\u00e9ng ritual not only asserted the ability of \nthese ancestral spirits to travel from the mountains, it also constituted a new conversation \nwith the land and the \u2018ancestors of the land\u2019 in the lowlands. Most significantly, in the \ndays following the ritual, there was much discussion of other possible future events, \nincluding ritual procedures to transfer the true, ritual \u2018rights\u2019 to the land to those living in \nKombo. What this shows is not only the ever-changing nature of people\u2019s pragmatic \nrelationship with a spiritual landscape, but also the resilience that they accord to the land \nas an agent. \n \nConclusion \n 20\n \nThe strength and resilience of the Manggarai spiritual landscape, given the \u2018purifications\u2019 \nfound in the wider region (see especially Amster and Howell, this issue), seems to require \nhistorical explanation. In this paper, I have argued that a significant factor was the \nparticular nature of the SVD mission on Flores which, by contrast with Protestant \nmissions elsewhere in Indonesia (Keane 2007), was both interested at an early stage in \nthe possibilities of inculturation, and tended to see \u2018local religion\u2019 as a fertile ground in \nwhich to plant Catholicism. A second factor I have emphasised is a pan-Indonesian split \nbetween the world religions (categorised as agama) and \u2018traditional\/ customary practices\u2019 \n(classified as adat). In southern Manggarai, the particular character of both priests and \nritual leaders means that this split is rigorously observed, without draining adat of its \nmoral and spiritual force. \n \nHowever, in addition to these historical factors, I have argued that the Manggarai \nspiritual landscape is resilient because it is a form of \u2018agricultural animism\u2019, less \nconcerned with constructing representations of the world than with engaging, practically, \nwith a capricious environment. Whilst Catholicism offers a welcome, extra layer of \nspiritual armoury for confronting harmful spirits, it does not engage with the more \npositive, fertile aspects of this landscape on which agricultural practice depends. If the \n\u2018signs\u2019 of the landscape can be read properly, if people understand what \u2018the land wants\u2019, \nthen it follows, for Manggarai people, that they will be fertile, children will be healthy, \nand crops will be abundant. Although Catholic practices can bless and protect water, they \ncannot provide the kind of fertility ensured by the spilling of blood and the calling forth \nof long-buried ancestors. Whilst a Mass might be thought to have scared away spirits \nobstructing a road-building project, the church is currently unable to involve itself in \nmore reciprocal relations with an ancestral, animate landscape. \n \nIn speaking of the \u2018resilience\u2019 of the Manggarai spiritual landscape, I do not wish to \nimply that it is unchanging or \u2018traditional\u2019. A key argument of this paper has been that the \nspiritual landscape of the lowlands has been profoundly affected by earlier state policies \nof village resettlement, and the building of wet-rice fields. Again, this shows the ability \n 21\nof the notion of \u2018spiritual landscapes\u2019 to expand our appreciation, beyond \u2018religion\u2019, of \nthe factors that influence understandings of spirit beings and places. Villagers in southern \nManggarai, as they grapple with land conflicts and declining productivity that threaten to \nturn the land \u2018hot\u2019, are creating new forms of engagement with the agency of the land. In \ndoing so, they prove both that landscapes and persons are permanently entangled, and \nthat landscapes are always historical.\n \nReferences \n \nAcciaioli, G. 1985.

Funding for attendance at the \nconference came from a British Academy Overseas Conference Grant and the London \nSchool of Economics. I am grateful to my co-panel-members, Matthew Amster, Brian \nHowell, Kari Telle, and to our discussant, Mary Steedly, for their thoughts on my original \npaper. Gregory Forth generously answered my queries on spirits and eels elsewhere in \nFlores. Thanks also to Matthew Engelke and three anonymous reviewers for \nAnthropological Forum, who commented on an earlier draft. \n2 The most common way to refer to \u2018charismatic\u2019 Catholics is as people who \u2018don\u2019t eat \nmedicine\u2019 (to\u00e9 hang rewos), since they usually reject the efficacy of healing practices that \ninvolve \u2018blowing\u2019 spells into roots or water. \n3 Gregory Forth (personal communication) suggests that eels may be \u2018doubly spiritual\u2019 in \nthis context since eels not only look like snakes (associated, throughout Flores, with \nspirits) but are also connected with spiritually-potent water sources. \n4 As in many areas of Southeast Asia (see Telle, this issue), Manggarai people associate \nthe health of both people and the land with coolness and dampness. \n 24\n                                                                                                                                                 \n5 On another occasion, one man, somewhat unusually, described the \u2018two religions\u2019 as the \n\u2018pagan religion\u2019 (agama kafir) and \u2018the religion of only a few days\u2019 (agama ata piha bari \nko\u00e9). \n6 Am\u00e9 de Sana\u2019s tears remind us of the biographical and idiosyncratic aspects of \nlandscape. Such \u2018personal landscapes\u2019 are explored in Allerton (forthcoming). \n7 Significantly, many Wae Rebo people say that a state official who ordered them to \nabandon their highland site later died, and that his death was caused by the \u2018energy of the \nland\u2019 (ghas de tana). \n"}
