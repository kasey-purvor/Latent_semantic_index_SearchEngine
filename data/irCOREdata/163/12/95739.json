It will be asserted that this lack of understanding reveals inadequacies in both the \nmathematics and economics. \nIt will be shown that in many (but not all) situations the rounding of an LP solution does not produce \nsatisfactory (feasible or optimal) solutions to an IP. A topical example will be given of political \napportionment leading to the Alabama Paradox.  \nIP is essentially concerned with the intersection of two structures: \n(i) Linear inequalities giving rise to polytopes. \n(ii) Lattices of integer points. \nMathematical and computational methods and results exist for both these structures on their own. \nHowever mixing them is like mixing oil and water. Problems arise in both the computation of \noptimal solutions and the economic interpretation of the results. It will be suggested that the \nappropriate mathematical structure is an integer monoid. This structure will be explained. Connected \nwith this structure are Chv\u00e1tal functions which are made up of non-negative combinations of the \narguments together with the (nested) integer round-up operation. The use of these functions, in place \nof the conventional non-negative linear combinations of LP allows one to capture many of the \nclassical LP, results eg. The Weyl-Minkowski theorems, \u2018pricing\u2019 of indivisible resources and the \nclosing of the \u2018duality gap\u2019 leading to the optimal IP solution. It will be shown how optimal Chv\u00e1tal \nfunctions can be  interpretated as the (non-marginal) valuation of indivisible resources. However a \nmajor problem remains as to how to represent them in a transparent and compact way. \n* This survey paper was given at a workshop, held at the London School of Economics on June 30 \n2009, to honour Professor Williams\u2019 career and retirement. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \nThe general (mixed) Integer Programme (IP) can be written: \nMaximise\/Minimise  k\nk\nkj\nj\nj ydxc \u2211\u2211 +  \nsubject to       ik\nk\nikj\nj\nji byexa <=>+\u2211\u2211  for all i \n0>=jx for all j , ky >= 0 and integer for all k \nFrequently (but not always) the integer variables are restricted to values 0 and 1 representing \n(indivisible) Yes\/No decisions. In such cases we can view such models as Logical statements about a \nseries of Linear Programmes (LPs). 0-1 IPs can be interpreted as Disjunctions of LPs. The \nrelationship between Logic and IP is explored by Hooker[15] and by Williams[33]. \nHowever we give little attention to this aspect of IP in this paper. Instead we concentrate on the \ngeneral case. \nThere are a vast number of actual and potential applications of IP. A survey of many practical \napplications is given in Appa, Pitsoulis and Williams[1]. Williams[32] concentrates on the modelling \nof many practical applications. We summarise the major applications below. \n1. Extensions of LPs, also to model investment and scheduling decisions in eg Manufacturing, \nDistribution, Petroleum, Gas and Chemicals give rise to mixed IPs. \n2. Non-convex, non-linear optimisation problems can only be satisfactorily solved to (global) \noptimality using IP methods. \n3. Power system loading problems which take account of the fixed costs of switching on \ngenerators. \n4. Distribution problems which involve routing decisions as well as the location of \nmanufacturing and storage plants. \n5. Telecommunications involving the location of eg concentrators as well as bandwidth \nallocation. \n6. Medical radiation problems involving the concentration and direction of x-rays. \n7. Statistical design involving the creation of eg Latin Squares. \n8. Molecular biology such as eg genome sequencing where fragments of DNA have to be \nordered into the most likely sequence. \n9. Archaeological seriation where the most likely sequence of sites over time is sought. \nThe latter two applications are examples of the famous Travelling Salesman Problem (see [18] \nalthough these two applications are not discussed there). \n10. Minimal size logical statements which can be used in eg medical diagnosis and credit \nscoring. \n11. Computer design where it is desired to locate components with possible objectives of eg \nminimising wire length (to optimise speed), cross-overs or number of components. \n12. Aircraft scheduling ie deciding which aircraft fly on which routes. \n13. Aircrew scheduling ie deciding which crews fly on which routes to eg minimise total \nnumber of crews or total cost. Constraints take account of physical incompatibilities (ie \nlimitations of time and place) as well as total work time and rest breaks. \nIt should be emphasised that, while major advances have been made in both methods of \nmodelling and computer systems (see eg Bixby et al [3]) the solving of large examples of some \napplications remain more aspirations than standard realisations. This is in contrast to LP where \nmodels with hundreds of millions of variables and constraints (these arise in LP formulations of \nStochastic Programmes, see eg [13]) can be solved. \nThe reasons for this contrast between LP and IP is one of the major themes of this paper. \n2. IP AND ROUNDING \nA common reaction of non-specialists when thinking about IP is to consider rounding the \noptimal LP solution. There are a few examples where rounding can be used (eg the Satisfiability \nProblem with Horn Clauses in Logic, see eg Williams[33]). The following small example \ndemonstrates why this may be unhelpful. \nConsider the LP \nMinimise           2x                                       with optimal solution \nsubject to  \n0,\n5\n3025\n132\n21\n21\n21\n21\n>=\n>=+\u2212\n<=+\n>=+\nxx\nxx\nxx\nxx\n                             232\n2\n 31 7   ,  2 == xx  \nThe corresponding IP is \nMinimise           2x                                       with optimal solution \nsubject to  \n0,\n5\n3025\n132\n21\n21\n21\n21\n>=\n>=+\u2212\n<=+\n>=+\nxx\nxx\nxx\nxx\n                             9   ,  2 21 == xx  \n                  and integer \nThere is no obvious way of generally moving from the LP solution to the IP solution. \nA number of other contrasts between the LP and IP solutions are worth noting. \n(i) The LP has 3 variables positive ( 21 , xx  and the slack in the 2\nnd constraint) in the optimal \nsolution. This is a result of the LP having 3 constraints (apart from the non-negativities).  \n(ii) The LP has 2 constraints binding (constraints 1 and 3) in the sense that if either or both of \nthese constraints is removed the optimal solution alters. If constraint 2 is removed the solution is \nunaltered. Hence constraint 2 has no economic value. This is a result of the LP having 2 \nstructural variables (the stated variables-not the slack or surplus variables in the constraints). The \noptimal LP solution is at X, the intersection of constraints 1 and 3. If either of these constraints is \nremoved the optimal solution moves to B or C respectively.  \n      These results are easily seen in figure 1. \n \n0 1 2 3 4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nLP Optimum X\nIP Optimum\nA\nB C\nx1\nx2\nCONSTRAINT 1 CONSTRAINT 2\nCONSTRAINT 3\n \n                                 Figure1. LP and IP Optima \nBut  \n(iii) The IP optimal solution at A (x1 = 2, x2 = 9) has 4 variables positive ( 21 , xx  and the slacks in \nthe 2nd and 3rd constraints). There is no simple relationship between this and the size of the IP. \n(iv) The IP has 3 constraints binding (constraints 1, 2 and 3). Again there is no simple \nrelationship with the size of the IP. \nThese results are seen in figures 2, 3 and 4.  \nIf constraint 1 is removed the optimal IP solution moves to B.  \n0 1 2 3 4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nB\nx1\nx2\nCONSTRAINT 2\nCONSTRAINT 3\n \n                             \n Figure 2.

Optimal IP Solution when Constraint 3 Removed \n \nThese relationships between LP and IP (or lack of them) are examined, in general, in section 3. \nSince the altering of any of the constraints in this IP example (although not all satisfied as \nequalities) alters the optimal objective value they all have economic value. This cannot be \nmeasured by marginal values as is done by LP dual values. However we seek an analogous IP \nvaluation. This is done in section 4. \nBefore considering these aspects we further demonstrate the inadequacies of rounding by a \npractical example. \n2.1 The Alabama Paradox \nThis is concerned with political apportionment. The problem arose in the USA in the 18th century \nwhen the number of members of the House of Representatives was increased from 299 to 300, as \na result of the method used to allocate representatives to individual states, based on their \npopulations. The number of representatives allocated to Alabama dropped from 8 to 7 (although \nthere had been no changes in populations). A small example demonstrates the method used and \nwhy it can lead to such a paradoxical result. \nSuppose we have three states with the populations given and 10 representatives to be allocated. \n \nState              Population       Fractional Allocation        Rounded Allocation   \nA                     621k                 4.41                                      4 \nB                     587k                 4.17                                      4 \nC                     201k                 1.43                                      2 \n \nThe fractional allocations are the proportions of the populations multiplied by 10. The rounded \n(integer) allocations are obtained by allocating the integer part and then allocating the total \nshortfall of representatives in decreasing order of fractional component. In this case, after \nallocating 4, 4 and 1 representatives respectively the remaining representative is allocated to C, \nhaving the largest fractional component. \nIf, however, we increase the total number of representatives to 11 the following allocation \nresults. \n \nState              Population       Fractional Allocation        Rounded Allocation   \nA                     621k                 4.81                                      5 \nB                     587k                 4.58                                      5 \nC                     201k                 1.57                                      1 \nAfter allocating 9 of the 11 representatives the remaining 2 are allocated to A and B respectively, \nhaving the largest fractional components. \nThe net effect is that although the total number of representatives  has increased C\u2019s \nrepresentation has decreased. This paradox and different methods of apportionment are discussed \nby Balinski and Young [2]. \nThe reason this example is topical is that it could equally well be applied to allocating seats to \npolitical parties in a proportional representation system. In the 2009 elections, for the European \nParliament, Britain was divided into 12 regions (Northern Ireland used a different system) and \nelectors, in each region, voted for a party, not an individual. Representatives were allocated to \nparties, depending on how many votes they got. If it were done in the same manner as that above \nthe Alabama paradox could result (the method is said to be \u2018non-monotonic\u2019). More seriously the \n\u2018fairness\u2019 of the method could be questioned. The method actually used is the D\u2019Hondt system \n(named after the Belgian mathematician D\u2019Hondt, see [9]). \nThe D\u2019Hondt system proceeds as follows: \nAllocate the first representative to the state (or party) with the most votes (or population). Then, \nnotionally, divide this state\u2019s (party\u2019s) votes (or population) by  2 and repeat the procedure. \nWhen a state (or party) has been allocated r representatives divide the original votes (or \npopulation) by r+1. Continue in this manner until all representatives have been allocated. After \nthe Alabama paradox was revealed, the USA system was altered to the Jefferson method which \nturns out to be equivalent to the D\u2019Hondt method. However the rationale behind both systems is, \nat first sight, obscure. \nThe reason for using this example in this paper is to formulate it as an IP. One of the merits of  \nbuilding an LP or an IP model, to solve a problem, is that it forces one to specify  objectives. In \nthe case of political apportionment one would probably specify an objective of fairness. If one \ndefines fairness in a Rawlsian sense (see Rawls [20]) then one can seek to Minimise the \nMaximum ratio of number representatives  to votes (or population).  \nIn order to do this we define integer variables xi  which give the number of representatives which \nshould be allocated to state (or party) i. \nIf state (party) i has population (vote) vi then we wish to choose xi so as to \n                                   Minimise Maximumi (xi\/vi) \n                                    subject to \u2211\ni\nix = Total number of representatives \nie make the maximum disparity in ratio of representatives to population (votes) as small as \npossible, in order to seek to equalise them. (It makes no sense to maximise the minimum ratio, in \nthe political case, since this is likely to be 0 if \u2018eccentric\u2019 parties compete). \nThe above model can easily be converted into a conventional (mixed) IP \n                                    Minimise y \n                                    subject to (xi\/vi) <= y  for all i \n                                                    \u2211\ni\nix = Total number of representatives \nwhere y is a continuous variable. \nIf this model is applied to the above example the following solution results, if there are 10 \nrepresentatives. \nState              Population       Fractional Allocation        IP Model Allocation  \nA                     621k                 4.41                                      5 \nB                     587k                 4.17                                      4 \nC                     201k                 1.43                                     1 \nIf one solves this model as an LP (dropping the integrality conditions to give the \u2018LP \nRelaxation\u2019) one obtains the fractional allocation (where all ratios are equal). \nTo see that the solution above is \u2018better\u2019 (\u2018fairer\u2019) than the rounded solution (ie rounding the LP \nsolution) one can observe that the maximum ratio, in the solution above, is 5\/621 which is \nsmaller than the maximum ratio of  2\/201 in the rounded solution. Indeed 5\/621 is the minimum \npossible. \nThe above solution is that which would be obtained by the D\u2019Hondt (Jefferson) method. It can be \nshown that this will always be the case. Hence these methods can be justified by the use of the \nabove (\u2018fair\u2019) IP formulation. In fact (although not usually explained as such) the D\u2019Hondt \nmethod is an iterative method of obtaining the Minimax solution). \nIt is interesting to note what the result would have been if the 2009 European elections (see [10]) \nhad used rounding rather than the fairer D\u2019Hondt (IP) system. The results (in representatives) \nwould have been very different. It would have resulted in (over Britain as a whole) \n \nParty                                            D\u2019Hondt Solution      Rounded Solution \nConservative                                             25                             21 \nUnited Kingdom Independence                13                              9 \nLabour                                                       13                             13 \nLiberal Democrats                                     11                             10 \nBritish National                                           2                               7 \nGreen                                                           2                               6 \nScottish Nationalist                                     2                               2 \nPlaid Cymru                                                1                               1 \n \n3. MATHEMATICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IP AND LP \nWe list below some of the main differences between the structure of the solutions to LPs and IPs. The \ndifferences in Computational Complexity between the two classes of models has been intensely \nstudied (see, for example Nemhauser and Wolsey [19]) The results below also suggest why IPs are \nusually much more difficult to solve than corresponding sized LPs. A standard reference for the theory \nof LP is Dantzig [7]. \nSome of these results were illustrated by the 2-variable example in the previous section. \n \n1. If an LP (in standard form), with m constraints (apart from the non-negativities), has an \noptimal          solution then among the optimal solutions will be one with at most m variables \n(structurals and  logicals) positive. \nSuch a solution is usually known as a basic solution, since the columns of the coefficient matrix \nform a vector space of m-tuples. Such a vector space can have a dimension of at most m. Basic \nsolutions correspond to vertices of the associated polytope (see figure 1). \nThis result can be exploited in methods such as the Simplex algorithm which restrict their search to \nthe (finite number of) basic solutions. \nFor IP there is no such corresponding result. Every variable could be positive, irrespective of \nthe size of m. This is demonstrated by the following class of IPs with 1 constraint (known as \nKnapsack problems). \nTake n prime numbers p1, p2 ,  ... ,pn . Define P = p1p2 \u2026 pn   ie their product. Define Pi = P\/pi . \nConsider the IP \nMaximise   i\ni\ni xP\u2211  \nsubject to   i\ni\ni xP\u2211 <= \u2211\ni\niP  \n    xi  >= 0 and integer for all i \nA non-negative combination of any proper subset of the Pi  must be a multiple of at least one of the \npi . But the right-hand-side cannot be a multiple of any of the pi since dividing it by any pi leaves a \npositive remainder. Hence the constraint cannot be satisfied as equality by any other than the \nsolution xi = 1 for all i . This is therefore the unique optimal solution showing all variables must be \npositive. \n2.  For an LP, with n structural variables,  at most n constraints (including non-negativity \nconstraints) will be binding (in the sense that removing them would cause the optimal objective \nvalue to change). \nThis result is equivalent to 1 above, for LP, since positive dual values correspond to  binding \nconstraints.  \nFor an IP, with n structural variables,  at most 2n -1 constraints (non-negativity constraints) \nwill be binding. This result is due to Scarf [24]. \n3. There are valuations on the constraints of an LP model which close the duality gap ie there is \na (symmetric) LP (dual) model. The binding constraints have positive  dual valuations. These dual \nvalues (when unique) represent the effect, on the optimal objective value, of marginal changes in \nthe right-hand-sides of the constraints and therefore have considerable economic importance in \nmany applications. \n      For an IP model there are no corresponding valuations which close the duality gap.  However there \nare Chvat\u00e1l functions  (see Chv\u00e1tal [6]) , discussed in section 5 ) which close the duality gap. \n      There is no obviously symmetric dual model which gives rise to the optimal Chv\u00e1tal function. \n  \n      The results above suggest the, rather unsatisfactory, understanding of the structure of solutions of \n(pure) IPs compared with LPs. They suggest a lack of understanding of the mathematical nature of IP. \nMisconceptions exist regarding structural properties of IP (and LP) such as those above. These are \nwell covered by Greenberg [14]. \n \n4. Lattices within Polytopes \nOne of the problems with understanding the mathematical nature of IP is that there are essentially two \nstructures involved. The conventional LP constraints give rise to polytopes, but within these polytopes \nthe integrality conditions give rise to lattices (this is generally the integer lattice, but reformulations \ncan result in other lattices). For LP the, well known, structural results discussed above exist. \nAnalogous results exist for lattices. When, however, the two structures are combined many of these \nstructural results are lost.  \nWe consider the model below. \nMaximise   212 xx +  \n subject to     \n)1(mod0\n)1(mod0\n)12(mod032\n0\n0\n632\n8092\n2\n1\n21\n2\n1\n21\n21\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261+\n<=\u2212\n<=\u2212\n<=\u2212\n<=+\nx\nx\nxx\nx\nx\nxx\nxx\n \nThe first four constraints define a polytope and the latter three constraints a lattice. \nIn order to illustrate a duality result for both structures independently we will firstly ask what is the \nstrongest statement about the objective function implied by the first four constraints. This may be \nobtained from the optimal dual values of \u2153, \u2154 0, 0 on the constraints. Adding them together in these \nmultiples gives  2x1 +x2 <= 30\u2154 , which is the optimal LP objective value.  \nThe strongest statement about the objective function implied by the latter three constraints can also \nbe obtained from multipliers on the constraints. Taking optimal multipliers of 3, 0, 4 on the \nconstraints and adding them together gives 2x1 +13x2 \u2261 0(mod 4). Since 13=1(mod 4) we have 2x1 \n+x2 \u22610(mod4). 4 is the largest such modulus implied. This duality result for congruences, presented \nin an analogous fashion to that for LP, is given by Williams [26] and [28]. It is sometimes known as \nthe integer form of Farkas\u2019 Lemma (see Schrijver [25]) and is equivalent to a result of Kronecker \n[17]. \nTaken together the two deductions, by means of multipliers, can only allow us to deduce that 2x1 +x2 \n<= 28. But figure 5 demonstrates that the optimal objective value, subject to the two types of \nconstraints,  is 24 since the line 2x1 +x2 =28 intersects no lattice points within the polytope.  \n \n0 6 12\n0\n4\n8\ny\nx\nObjective = 30.67\nObjective = 28\nObjective = 24\n \n                    Figure 5.   A  Lattice within a Polytope \nTechnically all we can deduce from the duality result for the congruences, taken together with the \nduality result for the LP Relaxation, is a rank 1 cut (see eg Nemhauser and Wolsey [19]). The \ncombining of the two structures demands  more sophisticated analysis (for which there are few \nstructural results). \nIt is worth noting that the solution of the inequality system can be done by the Simplex algorithm \n(see eg Dantzig [7]) and the \u2018solution\u2019 of the congruence system can be done by the Euclidean \nalgorithm (see Williams [26]). These are possibly the two most powerful algorithms in \nmathematics. \nA polytope can be represented as the sum of a polyhedron (a closed polytope) and a cone. A lattice \nwithin a polyhedron is obviously represented by a finite number of points. However lattices within \ncones give rise to an infinite number of points. They do, however, still have a structure. This \nstructure is an integer monoid . We contend that this structure is fundamental to understanding IP.  \nAn integer monoid consists of the non-negative integer combinations of a finite set of generating \nvectors (its Hilbert basis). Some integer monoids are polyhedral and some are non-polyhedral. \nPolyhedral integer monoids are those which are represented by lattice points within a cone. This is \nillustrated in figure 6. We consider the cone defined by the inequalities \n                          -2x + 7y >= 0 \n                             x \u2013 3y >= 0 \nand the lattice points with integer coordinates within this cone. \n \n \n \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nx\ny\nProjection  \n \nFigure 6.   A Polyhedral Monoid and its Projection into a Non-Polyhedral \n                 Monoid \n \n \nThe lattice within the cone is the polyhedral monoid generated by the vectors \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n1\n3\n  and  \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n2\n7\n. \n \nAn example of a non-polyhedral monoid is given by the projection of the above  monoid onto the x \naxis. This monoid is generated by the integers 3 and 7. Clearly this monoid is only a subset of the \ninteger points in the cone x>=0. \n \nProjection converts LPs into LPs, in a lower dimension, and offers a method  of solving LPs (see \nWilliams [31]) as well as deriving the dual. For IP this is not the case. We need to optimise over a \nmonoid. However it is always possible to lift a non-polyhedral integer monoid into a polyhedral one \nin a higher dimension (see Kirby and Williams [16]). \n \nInteger monoids have a structure, although it is not obvious how to exploit this in solving and \nunderstanding the structure of IPs. For example  1-dimensional integer monoids, where the \ngenerators have a greatest common divisor of 1, eventually generate all integers. The last integer \nwhich cannot be generated is known as the Frobenius number (see R\u00f6dseth [22]). It can be shown \nthat an integer monoid generated by (coprime) integers a and b has Frobenius number ab-(a+b). The \nfirst part of the monoid, up to and including, the Frobenius number, is known as the \u2018head\u2019 and the \nrest, the \u2018tail\u2019. It can also be shown that the head is the \u2018mirror image\u2019 of itself when reversed, in the \nsense that the non-representable values mirror the representable ones. This is demonstrated by figure \n7, where the projected monoid has been reversed at the bottom with 0 corresponding to the \nFrobenius number (11). \n \n \n \n \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nx\ny\nXXXXXX\nProjection\nReversal  \n \nFigure 7.

Duality in LP and IP \n \nAs discussed above LPs have well defined duals which are of great mathematical, structural and \neconomic importance. In fact a number of Nobel prizes for Economics have resulted from the \nexploitation of this concept in various contexts (eg Leontief , Samuelson, Koopmans, Kantorovitch), \n(see eg Dorfman, Samuelson and Solow [8]). \n \nValuations on discrete resources would have a number of applications. This question was first \naddressed by Gomory and Baumol [12].  In particular an \u2018unsolved\u2019 problem of accountancy is how \nto allocate fixed costs in an allocatively efficient fashion (see eg Butler and Williams [5]). We \nillustrate this by a model for the facilities location problem. \n \nLet y=0 or 1 depending on whether a facility should, or should not, be built, at a fixed cost of f. \n \nxi is the level of service to be provided to consumer i (up to level Di) at a profit of pi per unit \nprovided. \n \nA (mixed) IP model is \n  \niallforyDxtosubject\nfyxpMaximise\nii\ni\ni\ni\n0<=\u2212\n\u2212\u2211\n \n \n \nA dual value of vi  on  xi \u2013 Diy <= 0 would result in \n \n \nyvDfxvpMaximise i\ni\nii\ni\nii )()( \u2211\u2211 \u2212\u2212\u2212  \nie  an allocation of the fixed cost back to the consumers. \n \n \nNo obvious corresponding IP result is known to match LP duality.. However we construct what we \nregard as the most satisfactory structure for (pure) IPs by means of the value function of an IP. The \nvalue function of an LP or an IP is the optimal objective value as a function of the right-hand-side \nvalues. For an LP this can be constructed from the duality theorem using knowledge of all the \nvertices of the dual model. We illustrate this, using the numerical example from section 2, with \ngeneral right-hand-side values. This is \n \n \n                                   Minimise            2x                                       \n                                   subject to   \n0,\n25\n2\n21\n321\n221\n121\n>=\n>=+\u2212\n<=+\n>=+\nxx\nbxx\nbxx\nbxx\n      \nThe  value function is \n                                 Max (5b1-2b2 , \u2153b1+\u2154b3 , b3) \nThe LP is feasible so long as  \n \n                                Max (2b1-b2 , -b2 , -b2+2b3) <= 0 \n \nThis latter expression is known as the consistency tester. \nThe coefficients in the value function terms ( (5,-2,0), (\u2153,0, \u2154), (0,0,1) ) represent the vertices of \nthe dual polytope. This is because any right-hand-side for the original model corresponds to a set \nof objective coefficients in the dual model. Multiplying these by each vertex in the dual model, \nand taking the maximum, gives, by the LP duality theorem, the common optimal value for both \nmodels.  \nThe coefficients in the consistency tester terms ( (2,-1,0), (0,-2,0), (0,-1,2) ) represent the \nextreme rays of the dual polytope.  This is because if they are multiplied by any objective \ncoefficients of the dual model to make it  unbounded, the corresponding primal model with these \ncoefficients, as right-hand-side, must be infeasible.  \nWe can easily check that this LP is feasible with the values for the example in section 2, b1 = 13, \nb2 = 30, b3 = 5 and that the optimal objective value is \nMax (5, 7\u2154 , 5) = 7\u2154 \nIn order to try to capture the reliance of the LP value function on the duality results we consider \nthe corresponding  value function for the (pure) IP (see Blair and Jeroslow [4]). \n                                      Minimise            2x                                       \n                                   subject to   \n0,\n25\n2\n21\n321\n221\n121\n>=\n>=+\u2212\n<=+\n>=+\nxx\nbxx\nbxx\nbxx\n     \n                                                      and integer  \n \nThe  value function is \nMax (5b1-2b2 , \n\u250c\n\u2153(b1 + 2b3)\n\u2510\n, b3 ,  b1 + 2\n\u250c 1\/5 (  -b2 +2\n\u250c\n\u2153(b1 + 2b3  )\n \u2510\n) \n\u2510\n) \nwhere  \n\u250c\n \n\u2510 \nrepresents the integer round-up operation. \nThe consistency tester is (in this instance) the same as for the LP. \nThe above expression is known as a Gomory function since it reflects Gomory\u2019s algorithm for \nPIPs (see Gomory [11]). The component terms, involving linear combinations together with (in \ngeneral nested) integer round-up operations, are known as Chv\u00e1tal functions after Chv\u00e1tal [6]. \nUsing the values b1 = 13, b2 = 30, b3 = 5 the optimal objective value is \nMax(5, 8, 5, 9) = 9. \nHence the Chv\u00e1tal function  b1 + 2\n\u250c 1\/5 (  -b2 +2\n\u250c\n\u2153(b1 + 2b3  )\n \u2510\n) \n\u2510\n is that which gives rise to the \noptimal objective value. This confirms the observation illustrated in figures 2, 3 and 4 that all \nthree constraints are binding and should therefore be given an \u2018economic valuation\u2019. This aspect \nis discussed by Williams [29].   But the Chv\u00e1tal function above cannot be reduced (as in the LP \ncase) to a linear expression with coefficients corresponding to dual (marginal) values. Nor does \nthe \u2018relaxation\u2019 of this Chv\u00e1tal function (dropping the round-up operation and collecting terms) \ncorrespond to a vertex of the LP polytope. \nIn general (for a minimisation with >= constraints) the optimal Chv\u00e1tal function will consist of a \nnon-negative linear combination of the variables,  together with nested integer round up \noperations. If it is convenient to include = and <= constraints then these can give rise to negative \ncoefficients at the innermost level (as illustrated by the coefficient of  b2 in the above example). \nA Gomory function is a maximisation of a finite set of Chv\u00e1tal functions. Wolsey [34] refers to \nthis as the \u2018b-hull of a PIP\u2019. \nFor maximisations subject to <= constraints we would redefine Chv\u00e1tal functions using the \ninteger round-down operation. \nChv\u00e1tal functions are the IP analogue of the linear functions (using dual values as coefficients) \nfor LP. \nCalculating optimal Chv\u00e1tal functions is computationally difficult (unlike calculating optimal \ndual values in the LP case). If it turns out that, for an n variable PIP, only those constraints \nbinding at the LP optimum are needed (known as the IP over the optimal LP cone) then the value \nfunction reduces to a Chv\u00e1tal function. The calculation of this Chv\u00e1tal function is \nstraightforward and is discussed by Williams [27]. \nAnother problem is that of representing Chv\u00e1tal functions in a transparent and unique way ( \n\u2018normal form\u2019). In contrast, for the LP case, all that is needed is the vector of dual values. A \nuseful representation for the PIP case is as a directed tree. Each arc and each node has an \nassociated number. Numbers on arcs represent multiples in which associated terms are added and \nnumbers on nodes represent division together with integer round-up. We illustrate the tree \nassociated with the Chv\u00e1tal function b1 + 2\n\u250c 1\/5 (  -b2 +2\n\u250c\n\u2153(b1 + 2b3  )\n \u2510\n) \n\u2510\n in figure 8. \n  \n \n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n3\n5\n1\nb1 b3 \u2212b2\n \n \nFigure 8. Tree Representation of a Chv\u00e1tal Function \nThere is no guarantee that such a representation will be unique. Indeed it is sometimes possible \nto remove unnecessary rounding operations in Chv\u00e1tal functions. This is explored, in a limited \nway, by Rhodes and Williams [21]. \nFor example it is easy to verify, for integer n \n\u250c 2\/7 \n\u250c 7\/3n \n \u2510\n \n\u2510  \n\u2261  \n\u250c 2\/3n \n\u2510 \nBut\n \n\u250c 7\/3\n\u250c 2\/7 n \n \u2510\n \n\u2510 \n\u2260  \n\u250c 2\/3n \n\u2510  \n eg n = 1 \n \n\u250c 1\/3\n\u250c 5\/6n \n \u2510\n \n\u2510  \n\u2261  \n\u250c 5\/18n \n\u2510 \nBut\n \n\u250c 2\/3\n\u250c 5\/6n \n \u2510\n \n\u2510 \n\u2260  \n\u250c 5\/9n \n\u2510  \n eg n = 5 \n \nTwo other properties of Chv\u00e1tal functions are worth remarking on. \n \n(i) They obey the triangle inequality (when using integer round-up) since \n              \n\u250c\n a  \n\u2510 \n+\n  \u250c b  \n\u2510 \n>=\n \u250c a + b \n\u2510 \n \n            Hence they are of use in designing Discrete Metrics (see Rhodes and Williams [21]). \n \n(ii) They are  Shift Periodic  ie if f is a Chv\u00e1tal function \n            f(x\n1\n + a\n1\n, x\n2\n +a\n2 , \u2026, xn +an) = f(x1, x2, \u2026, xn) + b  \n            for some a\ni  \nand b, \nThis is illustrated in figure 9 for the Chv\u00e1tal function of one variable \n\u250c 1\/2  (x + 3\n\u250c 1\/9x \n \u2510\n )\n\u2510   \nwhich is (9, 6) shift periodic, ie  f(x + 9) = f(x) +6. \n \n \n \n01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 1510\n12\n16 17 18\nx\nf(x)\n \n                 Figure 9.  Shift Periodicity of a Chv\u00e1tal Function \nIt can be seen that this function is discontinuous, with an average gradient of 2\/3, but \u2018repeats \nitself\u2019 with a period of 9. \nAnother \u2018unification\u2019 which is provided by Chv\u00e1tal functions concerns the Weyl-Minkowski \ntheorems (see eg Schriver [25]). These give the \u2018dual\u2019 results that a polytope can alternatively be \ndescribed by linear inequalities or as a convex combination of its vertices together with a non-\nnegative combination of its extreme rays. \nThis extends to polyhedral monoids which can alternatively be described as the integer points \nwithin a polytope described by inequalities or as integer multiples of the elements in its Hilbert \nbasis. For example the polyhedral monoid illustrated in figure 6 can be described as the integer \npoints within the inequalities \n                                                 -2x + 7y >= 0 \n                                                     x \u2013 3y >= 0 \n       or alternatively as the non-negative integer multiples of the vectors \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n1\n3\n     and           \n      \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n2\n7\n. \nAlthough non-polyhedral monoids cannot be described as the integer points satisfying linear \ninequalities, they can always be described as the integer points satisfying inequalities involving \nChv\u00e1tal functions. The (projected) non-polyhedral monoid, also illustrated in figure 6, can be \ndescribed as the non-negative integer multiples of 3 and 7. It can alternatively be described as the \ninteger points satisfying \n                                           \u250c-x\/3\n\u2510 \n+\n \u250c2x\/7\n\u2510 \n<= 7 \nThis result is given by Ryan and Trotter [23] and Blair and Jeroslow [4]. \nIn conclusion we suggest that integer monoids and Chv\u00e1tal functions are fundamental structures in \ninteger programming and that the subject should be extended to the problem of optimising the \nlatter over the former. This could give the subject a unity which it so far lacks, by comparison with \nLP. \n \n6. References \n1.
