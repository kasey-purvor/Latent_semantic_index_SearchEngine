Although many of the checkpoint proteins\nthat transduce damage signals have been identified and\ncharacterized, the mechanism that senses the damage and\nactivates the checkpoint is not yet understood. To address\nthis issue for alkylation damage, we have reconstituted the\n \ncheckpoint response to MMS in \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts.\nUsing four different indicators for checkpoint activation\n(delay on entrance into mitosis, slowing of DNA replication,\nA\n \nphosphorylation of the Chk1 protein, and physical association\nof the Rad17 checkpoint protein with damaged DNA),\nwe report that MMS-induced checkpoint activation is\ndependent upon entrance into S phase. Additionally, we\nshow that the replication of damaged double-stranded DNA,\nand not replication of damaged single-stranded DNA, is\nthe molecular event that activates the checkpoint. There-\nfore, these data provide direct evidence that replication forks\nare an obligate intermediate in the activation of the DNA\ndamage checkpoint.\n \nIntroduction\n \nDamaged chromosomal DNA activates a signaling path-\nway (checkpoint) that serves to protect the cell against the\ngenotoxic consequences of continuation through the cell\ncycle in the presence of damage (Weinert and Hartwell,\n1988). When DNA damage is encountered during the S\nphase of the cell cycle, two of the major checkpoint-controlled\nresponses are the active prevention of entrance into mitosis\nand suppression of further DNA replication (for reviews\nsee O\u2019Connell et al., 2000; Zhou and Elledge, 2000). Ge-\nnetic experiments in both budding and fission yeast have\nprovided insight into how the damage checkpoint con-\ntrols cell cycle progression. In fission yeast, DNA damage\nactivates the Rad3 protein, which is a large, phosphatidyl-\ninositol-like protein kinase (for review see O\u2019Connell et\nal., 2000). Activation of Rad3 leads to phosphorylation\nand activation of the effector kinases Chk1 and Cds1.\nBoth Chk1 and Cds1 directly phosphorylate and inacti-\nvate the Cdc25 protein phosphatase, thus preventing en-\ntrance into mitosis.\nVertebrates contain two Rad3-like kinases, ataxia telangi-\nectasia-mutated (ATM)* and the ATM- and Rad3-related\nprotein kinase (ATR; for review see Abraham, 2001).\nATM is activated by double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB),\nand promotes cell cycle arrest through phosphorylation of\nvertebrate Cds1 (also known as Chk2; for reviews see Zhou\nand Elledge, 2000; Abraham, 2001). ATR is activated by a\nwide range of DNA structural aberrations, including UV\nlight\u2013induced damage and DNA replication blocks. Upon\nactivation, ATR directly phosphorylates vertebrate Chk1\n(Abraham, 2001). Thus, unlike fission yeast, where the\nsingle Rad3 kinase phosphorylates both Chk1 and Cds1, in\nvertebrate cells ATM and ATR appear to specifically act\nupon Cds1 and Chk1, respectively. After activation by\nATM\/ATR, both Chk1 and Cds1 phosphorylate and inac-\ntivate the vertebrate Cdc25 orthologue Cdc25C (Zhou and\nElledge, 2000).\nIn addition to ATM\/ATR, another group of checkpoint\nproteins (Rad17, Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1) is required to\ntransmit the presence of damage to Chk1\/Cds1. Rad17 is\nhomologous to the large subunit of the replication factor C\n(RFC) complex (Griffiths et al., 1995). RFC is a five-subunit\ncomplex (comprised of the RFC1\u20135 proteins) required\nduring DNA replication to recognize primer ends and to\nload the PCNA clamp protein onto the primed templates.\nRad17 has been shown to assemble into complexes with the\n \nAddress correspondence to W.

Consistent with this idea, the Rad9, Hus1, and\nRad1 proteins display homology to PCNA, and interact\nwith one another to form a complex (the 9\u20131-1 complex; for\nreview see Melo and Toczyski, 2002). Both Rad17 and 9\u20131-1\nassociate with damaged chromatin (Burtelow et al., 2000;\nKai et al., 2001; Kondo et al., 2001; Melo et al., 2001; Zou\net al., 2002), and chromatin association of 9\u20131-1 has been\nshown to be dependent on Rad17 (Kondo et al., 2001; Melo\net al., 2001; Zou et al., 2002).\nA major question in the cell cycle field is how checkpoint\nproteins sense damaged DNA to activate the checkpoint re-\nsponse. This problem is especially vexing for recognition of\ndamage induced by either alkylating agents or UV light, as\nthe lesions created by these particular genotoxic agents are\nnot as overt as DSBs, and often exhibit modest chemical dif-\nferences relative to undamaged DNA. One possibility is that\nthe lesions themselves are not recognized by the checkpoint,\nrather the checkpoint senses a consequence of the presence of\nthe lesion. For example, both alkylation and UV light\u2013induced\nlesions are known to block replication fork progression in\nprokaryotic systems (Friedberg et al., 1995). Therefore, in eu-\nkaryotes, it is possible that the checkpoint actually senses the\nstalled replication fork, and is otherwise incapable of sensing\nthe damage. Although this model is appealing, direct experi-\nmental evidence that the replication of double-stranded\nDNA (dsDNA) is essential for checkpoint activation in re-\nsponse to alkylation or UV light\u2013induced damage has not yet\nbeen provided. Additionally, any model that assumes that\nreplication forks are essential components of the damage\nsensing activity that activates the checkpoint must account\nfor how, or if, these lesions are detected outside of S phase.\nMost of what is known about the cell cycle phase depen-\ndence of damage checkpoint activation has come from ge-\nnetic analysis in budding yeast. For UV light\u2013induced dam-\nage, checkpoint activation occurs in all phases of the cell\ncycle (Siede et al., 1993, Vialard et al., 1998) when repair is\nproficient, but is restricted to S phase when repair is defi-\ncient (Neecke et al., 1999). One interpretation of these find-\nings is that the act of repairing the damage is sufficient to ac-\ntivate the checkpoint, perhaps through generation of nucleic\nacid intermediates such as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA),\nbut when repair is prevented, the checkpoint is then depen-\ndent on stalled replication forks for activation. Thus, in this\nscenario, repair and replication serve redundant functions in\ncheckpoint activation.\nIn the case of alkylation damage, the work in budding\nyeast has yielded less conclusive results. Paulovich and\nHartwell showed that when budding yeast cells are synchro-\nnized in G1 with \n \n\u0002\n \n factor mating pheromone, and then re-\nleased back into the cell cycle in the presence of methyl\nmethanesulfonate (MMS), the cell cycle is not significantly\nslowed until cells enter S phase (Paulovich and Hartwell,\n1995; Paulovich et al., 1997). This suggests that budding\nyeast cells do not mount a rigorous G1 response to MMS.\nConsistent with this, it has been shown that MMS-induced\nattenuation of the utilization of origins of replication in\nbudding yeast is restricted to late-firing origins, even if dam-\n \nage is induced during G1 (Shirahige et al., 1998). The fact\nthat only late-firing origins are negatively regulated by MMS\nsuggests that cells must enter S phase in order to generate the\nsignal that blocks origin firing, which is consistent with the\nlack of a G1 response to alkylation damage. In contrast to\nthese findings, however, are studies that used a different cri-\nterion for checkpoint activation, that being phosphorylation\nof the Rad53 checkpoint protein (a substrate of the budding\nyeast ATR homologue Mec1). In these experiments, it was\nshown that when cells harboring temperature-sensitive mu-\ntations in any number of genes that are required for S phase\nentry were incubated at the restrictive temperature, then\nRad53 was still phosphorylated in response to MMS (Pellici-\noli et al., 1999). Similarly, in another study, when cells were\nblocked in G1 with \n \n\u0002\n \n factor, they still induced Rad53 phos-\nphorylation in response to MMS (Vialard et al., 1998).\nThus, cells arrested in G1 have been shown to be capable of\ndetecting the alkylation damage, and activating Rad53.\nTherefore, these data are difficult to reconcile with the stud-\nies on the regulation of origin firing in response to MMS,\nwhich is known to require Rad53 (Shirahige et al., 1998). If\nRad53 activation can occur in G1 in response to MMS, why\naren\u2019t early firing origins prevented from firing when MMS\nis added before S phase entry?\nTo address the question of whether detection of alkylation\ndamage by the checkpoint is restricted to S phase, and to ex-\nplore the mechanism for checkpoint activation during S\nphase, we have taken a biochemical approach using \n \nXenopus\n \negg extracts. We report here that the mechanism that senses\nalkylation damage operates exclusively during S phase, and is\ndependent on the replication of dsDNA molecules. These\nresults indicate that replication forks represent the major\ndamage-sensing activity for activation of the DNA damage\ncheckpoint in response to alkylation damage.\n \nResults\n \nAlkylation damage of DNA activates the DNA damage \ncheckpoint in \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts\n \nTo address how alkylation damage of DNA generates a\ncheckpoint signal in \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts, we first sought to\nestablish that the egg extract system induces a bona fide\ncheckpoint response to MMS-induced damage. Therefore,\ndemembranated sperm chromatin was treated with MMS to\nalkylate the DNA, and the MMS was then removed from the\nchromatin by multiple washings. To determine if the alkyl-\nated sperm chromatin triggers the DNA damage checkpoint\nin vitro, we used cycling egg extracts (Murray, 1991). These\nextracts are produced by low speed centrifugation of freshly\nlaid eggs. Upon supplementation with an energy regenerat-\ning system and sperm chromatin, the extracts assemble a nu-\ncleus around the chromatin, the DNA is replicated, and, af-\nter replication, the extracts activate the cdc2-cyclin B kinase\nand enter mitosis. It has been shown that damaged DNA in\nthe form of DSBs or UV light\u2013induced lesions, generates a\nsignal that prevents mitosis in cycling egg extracts (Kumagai\net al., 1998; Michael and Newport, 1998; Guo and Dunphy,\n2000). To ask if alkylation damage generates such a signal,\neither control or alkylated chromatin was mixed with cycling\nextracts and entrance into mitosis was determined micro-\n o\nn\n June 10, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPublished \n Replication-dependent checkpoint activation |\n \n Stokes et al. 865\n \nscopically through visualization of nuclear envelope break-\ndown (Murray, 1991). We found that the alkylated chroma-\ntin induced a substantial delay on entrance into mitosis (Fig.\n1 A), as extracts containing MMS-treated chromatin entered\nmitosis an average of 75 min after a control reaction contain-\ning undamaged DNA entered mitosis. As expected, DSBs\nalso generated a signal that delayed mitosis in these extracts.\nTo determine if the lag on entrance into mitosis was due to\nactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint, we also per-\nformed the experiments in the presence of 5 mM caffeine.\nCaffeine is an inhibitor of both the ATM and ATR check-\npoint kinases (Sarkaria et al., 1999), and inclusion of caffeine\ncompletely reversed the mitotic delay imposed by MMS-\ntreated chromatin and DSBs (Fig. 1 A).\nIn budding yeast, MMS-induced damage activates the\nMec1 protein kinase. The metazoan Mec1 homologue is\nATR, and it was therefore of interest to determine if ATR\nactivation occurs in response to alkylation damage in \n \nXeno-\npus\n \n. To do so, we used a previously published Chk1 phos-\nphorylation assay (Michael et al., 2000). Chk1 is an ATR\nsubstrate, and removal of ATR from egg extract by immu-\n \nnodepletion prevents Chk1 phosphorylation in response to\nstalled replication forks or UV light\u2013induced damage (Guo\net al., 2000). Therefore, Chk1 phosphorylation is a reliable\nindicator of activation of ATR kinase in \n \nXenopus\n \n extracts. To\nassay for ATR activation, cycling extracts were prepared and\nsupplemented with a radio-labeled fragment of \n \nXenopus\n \nChk1 (Chk1 \n \n\u0003\n \nKD; for review see Michael et al., 2000). Af-\nter a 60-min incubation period, a sample of the extract was\nremoved and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for slower migrating\nforms of Chk1 \n \n\u0003\n \nKD, which we have previously shown to re-\nsult from checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation (Michael et\nal., 2000). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the DNA replication inhib-\nitor (aphidicolin) induced phosphorylation of Chk1 \n \n\u0003\n \nKD,\nas expected (Michael et al., 2000), as did MMS treatment of\nthe chromatin sample. Chk1 \n \n\u0003\n \nKD phosphorylation was not\nobserved in an extract containing control, undamaged sperm\nchromatin, nor in an extract containing DSBs, as expected\nfrom published data showing that DSBs do not induce\nChk1 phosphorylation (Guo and Dunphy, 2000). Taken\ntogether, the data in Fig. 1 show that MMS treatment of\nsperm chromatin activates the ATR checkpoint kinase and\ndelays entrance into mitosis in frog egg extracts.\nMMS treatment has been shown to slow progression\nthrough S phase in human (Painter, 1977) and yeast (Pau-\nlovich and Hartwell, 1995) cells. Therefore\n \n,\n \n we asked if\nDNA replication in frog egg extracts is affected by alkyla-\ntion. To study replication, we turned to a soluble system for\nDNA replication analysis that makes use of concentrated\nnucleoplasmic extracts (NPEs; Walter and Newport, 1999).\nTo prepare NPE, nuclei are formed in the conventional ex-\ntract system. The nuclei are then purified, and the soluble,\nnucleoplasmic fraction from the purified nuclei is extracted.\nAlthough it is devoid of membranes, this soluble fraction\ncontains all of the components required for rapid, complete,\nand cell cycle\u2013regulated chromosomal replication. To mea-\nsure DNA replication in this system, DNA templates are\nfirst incubated in the high speed supernatant (HSS) of\negg extract. This incubation allows prereplicative complex\n(preRC) formation to occur before the addition of NPE,\nand is necessary because NPE contains activities that are in-\nhibitory toward preRC assembly. Upon NPE addition,\nDNA replication initiates synchronously from all active ori-\ngins, and rapidly goes to completion (Walter et al., 1998).\nTo compare the replication of MMS-treated chromatin\nwith undamaged chromatin in NPE, we incubated both types\nof chromatin first in HSS, to assemble the preRCs, and then\nNPE, along with radio-labeled dATP, was added to initiate\nreplication. Aliquots of the reaction were taken every 30 min\nfor 90 min, and the amount of replication was determined by\nagarose gel electrophoresis of the radio-labeled replication\nproducts. As shown in Fig. 2 A, MMS treatment of the chro-\nmatin induced a substantial delay in the kinetics of DNA rep-\nlication. After 30 min, the alkylated sample had replicated to\njust 26% of the control; after 60 min, the control sample had\ncompleted replication, whereas the MMS-treated sample had\nreplicated to 38% of the level of the control sample. Even after\n90 min, the MMS-treated sample had not finished replication,\nand was just 57% of the final value for the control. From this\nexperiment, we conclude that MMS treatment slows DNA\nreplication in \n \nXenopus,\n \n just as it does in yeast and human cells.\nFigure 1.

To do so, replication of individual sperm\nchromatin templates within mixed populations of damaged\nand undamaged DNA was assessed by fluorescence micros-\ncopy in NPE. Because NPE does not contain membranes,\nnuclear envelopes do not form around sperm chromatin\nFigure 2. MMS-induced trans-inhibition of the replication of undamaged DNA. \n(A) Replication of control and MMS-treated chromatin in NPE. The HSS of egg extract \nwas supplemented with sperm chromatin (control) or MMS-treated sperm chromatin \n(MMS). After a 30-min RT incubation to assemble chromatin and form preRCs, 2 vol \nNPE were added along with [32P]dATP, and samples were recovered after continued \nincubation for 30, 60, or 90 min. All samples contained 2,000 sperm nuclei\/\u0004l after \naddition of NPE. The replication products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis \nand exposure of the dried gel to a Phosphorimager screen. The graph shows the \nquantification of the radioactivity present in a given sample. These values are \nexpressed as arbitrary units, where the value for the control sample at 90 min was set \nto 100, with all other samples adjusted accordingly. The data shown are from a \nsingle experiment, and are representative of four independent experiments. (B) Exper-\nimental strategy. When control (undamaged) or MMS-treated chromatin are incubated \nseparately in NPE containing fluorescent nucleotides, the control sample will appear \nbrighter due to its enhanced ability to undergo DNA replication. To ask if the MMS-\ntreated sample inhibits DNA replication in trans, control and MMS-treated chromatin \nare incubated together in the same NPE. If the inhibition works in cis only, then two \npopulations of fluorescent chromatin will result: a bright population (corresponding \nto the control template) and a dim population (corresponding to the MMS-treated \nsample). However, if inhibition can also work in trans, then all chromatin templates in the coincubation are expected to exhibit reduced \nfluorescence, relative to the control sample alone. (C) Either control, undamaged sperm chromatin (control), or MMS-treated sperm chromatin \n(MMS), or a 50:50 mixture of both (control \u0006 MMS) were incubated for 30 min in HSS. After the 30-min incubation, NPE containing bio-dUTP \nwas added to the reactions. Incubation was performed for an additional 30 min before processing of the samples for detection of bio-dUTP \nincorporation with fluorescent streptavidin. In the panel labeled control \u0006 MMS\/gem., MMS-treated chromatin was incubated in HSS with\nrecombinant geminin for 30 min, then combined with control, undamaged chromatin that had been incubated separately in HSS-lacking geminin, \nalso for 30 min. NPE-containing bio-dUTP was then added to the combined sample. Panels labeled Bio-dUTP display signal obtained from \nstaining of the samples with Texas red\u2013conjugated streptavidin, to detect the bio-dUTP, and panels labeled DAPI correspond to DAPI staining \nof the samples to visualize the DNA. (D) Quantification of the data presented in C. The fluorescent intensity of a minimum of 50 nuclei for each \nsample from each of two independent experiments was determined using the Scion Image software package from images obtained from a \nfluorescence microscope (BX51; Olympus) attached to a Spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). The control \u0006 MMS\/gem. sample is \nrepresented by two bars (labeled dim and bright) to provide individual quantification for the two classes of nuclei present in this particular sample.\n o\nn\n June 10, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPublished \n Replication-dependent checkpoint activation |\n \n Stokes et al. 867\n \ntemplates when they are incubated in NPE (Walter et al.,\n1998). Thus, there are no physical barriers separating dam-\naged and undamaged DNA if they are coincubated in the\nsame NPE. Given this, we reasoned that if replication of un-\ndamaged DNA was affected by the presence of alkylated\nDNA, then this could be uncovered through the visualiza-\ntion of the replication of individual sperm chromatin tem-\nplates in NPEs containing a mixture of damaged and un-\ndamaged samples (see Fig. 2 B). To visualize replication of\nindividual nuclei within a population, biotinylated dUTP\n(bio-dUTP) was added to NPE during the replication reac-\ntion, and, after incubation, the samples were fixed and\nstained with fluorescent streptavidin to monitor uptake of\nthe bio-dUTP within individual nuclei.\nAs shown in Fig. 2 C (control), when undamaged sperm\nchromatin alone was used in the experiment, the templates\nwere highly fluorescent, indicating that the bio-dUTP was\nefficiently being incorporated into the replication templates.\nIn contrast, when the MMS-treated sperm chromatin was\nused in the reaction, the fixed samples were not nearly as\nbright (Fig. 2 C, MMS). Quantification of the fluorescence\nintensity of 100 representative nuclei demonstrates that rep-\nlication in the MMS-treated sample was 41% that of the\ncontrol sample, which is consistent with the reduced level of\nDNA synthesis in NPE containing alkylated templates, as\nmeasured by uptake of radio-labeled nucleotides (see Fig. 2\nA). To ask if the presence of alkylated chromatin affected\nreplication of undamaged chromatin, we analyzed a sample\ncontaining 50% control and 50% MMS-treated chromatin\n(Fig. 2 C, control \n \n\u0006 \n \nMMS). We found the level of fluores-\ncence in this mixed sample was uniform, indicating that all\ntemplates had replicated to the same relative level, but that\nthis level was less than that observed in the sample contain-\ning undamaged sperm chromatin alone. Indeed, quantifica-\ntion showed that the level of replication in the mixed sample\nwas very similar to that observed in the sample containing\nMMS-treated chromatin alone (see Fig. 2 D). From this ex-\nperiment, we conclude that alkylation damage of DNA gen-\nerates a diffusible inhibitor that negatively regulates the rep-\nlication of undamaged DNA when coincubated in NPE.\nTaken together with the data in Fig. 1, these experiments\nalso show that the canonical features of the DNA damage re-\nsponse (delay on entrance into mitosis, slowing of DNA rep-\nlication, and activation of ATR) are recapitulated in the cell-\nfree egg extract system.\n \nDNA replication is required to generate\nthe MMS-induced DNA damage signal\n \nHaving established that MMS treatment of sperm chroma-\ntin activates a bona fide checkpoint response in this egg ex-\ntract system, we next turned to the question of the S phase\ndependence of activation of this checkpoint. To do so, we\nfirst examined the ability of MMS-treated chromatin to in-\nhibit mitosis in cycling extracts containing the DNA replica-\ntion inhibitor, geminin (McGarry and Kirschner, 1998).\nGeminin targets Cdt1, an essential replication factor that is a\ncomponent of the preRCs that form on origins of replica-\ntion before S phase entry (Wohlschlegel et al., 2000; Tada et\nal., 2001). Therefore, chromatin that is formed in geminin-\ncontaining extracts does not contain preRCs, and cannot\ninitiate DNA replication. As shown in Fig. 3 A, and as ex-\npected (for review see Michael et al., 2000), geminin had no\ninfluence on the kinetics of entrance into mitosis of the con-\ntrol sample. In contrast, in extracts containing MMS-treated\nchromatin, the addition of geminin completely abrogated\nthe mitotic delay normally seen in the alkylated DNA\u2013con-\ntaining samples (Fig. 3 A). Geminin itself is not a global\ncheckpoint inhibitor, as it had no effect at all on the ability\nof DSBs to induce a mitotic delay in cycling extracts (Fig. 3\nA), and its ability to block the alkylation damage checkpoint\nwas lost if geminin were added to the reaction after preRCs\nhad assembled on the chromatin (unpublished data). Con-\nFigure 3. The initiation of DNA replication is required to generate \nthe MMS damage signal.

The samples were then further supplemented with either \nsperm chromatin (control DNA), MMS-treated sperm chromatin \n(MMS DNA) or sperm chromatin and plasmid DNA that had been \nlinearized by restriction enzyme digestion (25 ng\/\u0004l; DSB DNA). \nEntrance into mitosis was determined as in Fig. 1 A, and the data are \nplotted as in Fig. 1 A.

After a 60-min incubation, \nsamples were recovered for SDS-PAGE. The input lane shows the \nChk1 \u0003KD protein before incubation with Xenopus egg extract.

Where indicated, the samples \nalso included caffeine (caf., at 5 mM) or recombinant geminin \n(gem., at 250 nM). The sample labeled no DNA refers to a sample \nthat was processed in the absence of any sperm chromatin addition, \nshowing that Rad17 recovery is dependent on the addition of chro-\nmatin.

It was important\nto ensure that damage checkpoint activation in response to\nMMS was dependent on DNA replication, and was not\nblocked due to an unknown activity of geminin. Therefore,\nwe used p27\n \nKip\n \n (Toyoshima and Hunter, 1994), an inhibitor\nof the cdk2-cyclin E kinase that is required to initiate DNA\nreplication. Treatment of extracts with p27\n \nKip\n \n allows preRC\nassembly, but prevents replication forks from assembling at\norigins of replication (Michael et al., 2000). As shown in\nFig. 3 B, treatment of extracts with p27\n \nKip\n \n also prevented\nChk1 \n \n\u0003\n \nKD phosphorylation in response to the MMS-\ntreated chromatin. Thus, two independently acting inhibi-\ntors of entrance into S phase, geminin and p27\n \nKip\n \n, both\nblock Chk1 phosphorylation in response to alkylation dam-\nage. From the data in Fig. 3, we conclude that \n \nXenopus\n \n egg\nextracts must enter S phase in order to generate the DNA\ndamage checkpoint signal that activates ATR, and delays en-\ntrance into mitosis.\nNext, we asked if DNA replication was required for the\nMMS-treated sperm chromatin to inhibit, in trans, the rep-\nlication of undamaged DNA (Fig. 2). To do so, we estab-\nlished conditions where preRC assembly was selectively in-\nhibited on alkylated chromatin, and then coincubated this\nchromatin, in NPE, with undamaged chromatin that con-\ntained intact preRCs. To block preRC assembly, alkylated\nchromatin was incubated in HSS containing geminin. Con-\ntrol, undamaged chromatin was incubated in HSS lacking\ngeminin, and consequently contained intact preRCs. Once\npreRCs are formed, geminin can no longer inhibit DNA\nreplication (McGarry and Kirschner, 1998). After separate\nincubations in HSS, the two samples were combined in the\nsame NPE, and replication was measured by uptake of bio-\ndUTP. Unlike the experiment shown in Fig. 2 C (control \n \n\u0006\n \nMMS), where the fluorescence intensity was low and uni-\nform from sample to sample, the experiment containing un-\ndamaged chromatin with geminin-treated damaged chroma-\ntin (Fig. 2 C, control \n \n\u0006 \n \nMMS\/gem.) showed two distinct\nclasses of chromatin samples, one very bright (105% of the\ncontrol sample after quantification of the fluorescence inten-\nsity) and the other exhibiting low levels of fluorescence\n(13% after quantification of the fluorescence intensity).\nThus, the geminin-treated damaged chromatin, unlike the\ndamaged chromatin lacking geminin, could not reduce the\nfluorescence intensity of the undamaged sample. From this\ndata, we conclude that the alkylated chromatin must initiate\nreplication in order to generate the trans-acting signal that\nblocks replication on undamaged replicons.\n \nThe Rad17 checkpoint protein associates \nspecifically with damaged DNA in a \nDNA replication\u2013dependent manner\n \nRad17 is thought to be part of a complex that loads the 9\u20131-1\ncomplex onto damaged DNA (for review see Melo and\nToczyski, 2002). Consistent with this, Rad17 itself has been\nshown to physically associate with chromatin in both human\n(Zou et al., 2002) and fission (Kai et al., 2001) yeast cells.\nBecause Rad17 is required for checkpoint activation in all\nsystems tested, we determined its chromatin binding proper-\nties in \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts. Egg extracts were prepared and\nsupplemented with either control, undamaged sperm chro-\nmatin, or with sperm chromatin that had been treated with\nMMS. Chromatin was isolated after 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90\nmin of incubation by sucrose density centrifugation, and\nprobed by immunoblotting for the presence of \n \nXenopus\n \nRad17. As shown in Fig. 3 C, little if any Rad17 could be\ndetected in any of the undamaged chromatin samples except\nfor the 45-min time point. This time point corresponds to\nmaximal DNA replication activity in these extracts, and it is\ntherefore tempting to speculate that this low level associa-\ntion of Rad17 with actively replicating chromatin is func-\ntionally significant. In contrast to the undamaged chroma-\ntin, when MMS-treated chromatin was added to the extract,\nwe found a robust and time-dependent association of Rad17\nwith the chromatin. This association peaked by 60 min, and\nshowed a modest decrease at 90 min. Interestingly, Rad17\nchromatin association was markedly enhanced when the\nATR inhibitor caffeine was included in the extract. To ask if\nDNA replication was required for Rad17 chromatin associa-\ntion with MMS-treated DNA, the experiment was per-\nformed in the presence of geminin. As shown in Fig. 3 C, no\nRad17 could be detected in the MMS-treated chromatin\nfraction purified from extract containing geminin. Taken to-\ngether, the data in Fig. 3 C show that Rad17 specifically in-\nteracts with damaged DNA, and that this interaction re-\nquires ongoing DNA replication. If Rad17 association with\ndamaged chromatin were a prerequisite for checkpoint acti-\nvation, as seems likely (for review see Kai et al., 2001), then\nthis would explain the requirement for DNA replication in\nactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint.\n \nDNA synthesis, per se, is not sufficient for damage \ncheckpoint activation\n \nThe data in Figs. 2 and 3 show a clear S phase dependence\nfor multiple aspects of checkpoint signaling, including the\nblocks to mitosis and further DNA replication, activation of\nATR kinase, and physical association of Rad17 with chroma-\ntin. There are many possible reasons for this requirement for\nS phase entry. For example, unwinding of the DNA duplex\nbefore replication may be the critical event, as unwinding\ngenerates ssDNA and\/or exposes lesions to the checkpoint\nsensors. Indeed, during DSB repair, it is has been shown that\nthe amount of ssDNA that is produced during the repair re-\naction influences the intensity of the checkpoint response\n(Lee et al., 1998). Therefore, it is possible that alkylated\nssDNA is sufficient to activate the checkpoint. Alternatively,\nphysical contact between DNA polymerase and the lesion\nmay be the event that triggers checkpoint activation. If this\nwere so, then primer extension on alkylated ssDNA tem-\nplates could, in principle, activate the checkpoint. It is also\npossible that some aspect of dsDNA replication, such as\nphysical contact between the replicative helicase and lesions,\nis the signal that activates the checkpoint. To begin to ad-\ndress which aspect of DNA replication is required to gener-\nate the MMS damage signal, we compared the ability of\nalkylated M13 circular ssDNA templates to alkylated plas-\nmid dsDNA templates to activate the checkpoint in the NPE\nsystem. We chose NPE because this system, unlike conven-\n o\nn\n June 10, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPublished \n Replication-dependent checkpoint activation |\n \n Stokes et al. 869\n \ntional egg extracts, is capable of efficient and cell cycle\u2013regu-\nlated replication of simple DNA substrates such as plasmid\nDNAs (Walter et al., 1998). To prepare for this analysis, rep-\nlication of undamaged M13 ssDNA was first assessed in\nNPE. We found that M13 ssDNA replication in NPE re-\nquires a preannealed primer, as samples that lack a primer are\nnot replicated (Fig. 4 A). This was surprising, as it is well es-\ntablished that M13 ssDNA replication in conventional egg\nextracts is not dependent on a primer. At present, we do not\nunderstand why M13 ssDNA replication is primer-depen-\ndent in NPE. If the M13 ssDNA was treated with MMS be-\nfore incubation in NPE, then replication was blocked despite\nthe presence of a preannealed primer (Fig. 4 A). This shows\nthat alkylation blocks even simple primer extension reac-\ntions, and supports the idea that MMS-induced lesions form\na physical blockade to polymerase movement in eukaryotes,\nas has been shown in prokaryotes (Friedberg et al., 1995).\nHaving shown that alkylation blocks the primer-depen-\ndent replication of M13 ssDNA in NPE, we next assessed\nthe ability of the M13 templates to activate the damage\ncheckpoint in NPE. As a positive control, we determined\nthat alkylation of closed circular dsDNA induced phosphor-\nylation of Chk1 in NPE (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, we found\nthat checkpoint activation by the dsDNA molecules re-\nquired DNA replication, as the Chk1 phosphorylation did\nnot occur in extracts containing geminin. In contrast to the\ndsDNA, we found that neither the primed nor unprimed\nalkylated M13 ssDNA templates were capable of activating\nthe checkpoint (Fig. 4 B). The inability of the ssDNA to\ntrigger a checkpoint response was not due to alkylation, as\nunalkylated M13 ssDNA also failed to trigger the check-\npoint (unpublished data). From these data, we conclude that\nlarge amounts of ssDNA are not sufficient to activate the\ncheckpoint. Therefore, the involvement of DNA replication\nin activation of the checkpoint is likely to extend beyond\nsimple unwinding of the template strands. The experiment\nalso shows that the attempt at DNA synthesis, per se, is also\nnot sufficient to activate the checkpoint. If so, then the in-\nclusion of the primer on the MMS-treated M13 ssDNA\ntemplates would be expected to activate the checkpoint.\nBased on these results, we conclude that replication of dam-\naged dsDNA molecules is the S phase activity that generates\nthe alkylation damage signal for checkpoint activation.\n \nDiscussion\n \nIn this article, we have used \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts to address\nan important area in cell cycle checkpoint research, how\ndamaged DNA is sensed to trigger the checkpoint response.\nIn particular, we examined the checkpoint response to al-\nkylation damage, as induced by the commonly used geno-\ntoxic agent MMS. The findings reported here make three\nimportant points with regard to how alkylation damage is\nsensed by the checkpoint in \n \nXenopus\n \n. First, MMS-induced\ncheckpoint activation can be recapitulated in the in vitro egg\nextract system. Second, the ability to activate the checkpoint\nin response to alkylation damage requires entrance into S\nphase. Third, DNA synthesis, per se, is not sufficient for\ncheckpoint activation, and neither is the accumulation of\nssDNA. Rather, a structure that forms when replication is\nattempted on damaged dsDNA constitutes the signal for ac-\ntivation of the checkpoint in response to alkylation damage.\n \nRecapitulation of the alkylation damage checkpoint \nin \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts\n \nTo apply biochemical approaches to the question of damage\ncheckpoint activation, it was first necessary to establish that\nkey features of the checkpoint response to alkylation damage\nFigure 4. Replication structures specific for dsDNA replication \nare required to generate the MMS damage signal. (A) M13 ssDNA \nwas annealed to an oligonucleotide primer, or not, and then incubated \nin NPE containing [32P]dATP (final concentration of M13 ssDNA \nwas 5 ng\/\u0004l). Additionally, M13 ssDNA was alkylated, annealed \nto a primer, and incubated in NPE at 5 \u0004g\/ml. After either 30 or 60 \nmin, aliquots were removed from the reaction and processed for \nDNA replication analysis on agarose gels. The top portion of the \nfigure shows the gel, and beneath it is a bar graph showing the \nvalues obtained after analysis of the scanned gel on a Phosphorimager. \nAfter quantification of the data by Phosphorimager analysis, the \nvalue for the 60-min time point for M13 ssDNA plus primer was set \nto 100, and all other data were normalized accordingly. (B) NPE was \nsupplemented with recombinant, bacterially expressed Chk1\u0003KD at \n5 ng\/\u0004l. The reactions were further supplemented with either alkylated \nM13 ssDNA (ssDNA), alkylated M13 ssDNA containing a preannealed \noligonucleotide primer (primed ssDNA), or plasmid DNA that had \nbeen incubated previously in 0.5 vol of HSS either in the absence \n(dsDNA) or presence (dsDNA \u0006 gem.) of recombinant geminin \n(at 250 nM). After 60 min of incubation, samples were withdrawn \nand analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting for the phosphor-\nylation status of Chk1\u0003KD was performed. Chk1\u0003KD was detected \nusing a T7 mAb that recognizes the epitope tag supplied by the \nexpression vector used to produce the recombinant Chk1\u0003KD. \nPlasmid DNA was present at 25 ng\/\u0004l final concentration, whereas \nM13 DNA was present at 75 ng\/\u0004l final concentration.

For\nthis, we demonstrated that MMS treatment of sperm chro-\nmatin templates resulted in the induction of a delay on en-\ntrance into mitosis in cycling extracts, and that the alkylated\nchromatin induced phosphorylation of the ATR substrate\nChk1. Additionally, we found that the ATM substrate\nCds1\/Chk2 was not phosphorylated in response to MMS\ntreatment (unpublished data). These data strongly suggest\nthat alkylation damage activates the ATR, and not the\nATM, checkpoint kinase in \n \nXenopus.\n \nTo explore other aspects of damage checkpoint activa-\ntion, we examined binding of the Rad17 protein to dam-\naged and undamaged DNA, and found that Rad17 specifi-\ncally binds to damaged chromatin in \n \nXenopus\n \n. Thus,\nRad17 association with DNA is induced by the presence\nof damage in this system, and this association likely repre-\nsents a very early event in activation of the checkpoint.\nThis finding is consistent with work from fission yeast\n(Kai et al., 2001), but unlike the findings in a recent re-\nport in which human Rad17 was found to constitutively\nassociate with chromatin (Zou et al., 2002). This discrep-\nancy may be due to species differences or to differences in\nthe chromatin isolation protocols used in frog egg extracts\nrelative to intact human tissue culture cells. Additionally,\nwe note that inhibition of ATR kinase activity, by caffeine,\nseems to induce an enhanced association of Rad17 with\ndamaged DNA. The enhancement of Rad17 association\nchromatin in response to caffeine in our experiment might\nreflect a requirement for ATR in release of Rad17 from\ndamaged chromatin. Although this is an attractive hypoth-\nesis, especially in light of recent reports showing that\nRad17 is a direct substrate of the ATM\/ATR kinase family\n(Bao et al., 2001; Post et al., 2001), further work will be\nrequired to verify this.\nWhen DNA replication of MMS-treated chromatin was\nassessed, we found that replication was significantly delayed,\nas has been shown in vivo in both yeast and human cells.\nFurthermore, this replication slow down was not restricted\nto the damaged DNA, as we found that replication of un-\ndamaged DNA was also negatively affected when coincu-\nbated with damaged DNA. This is consistent with genera-\ntion of a diffusible inhibitor that can negatively regulate\nDNA replication in trans\n \n.\n \n In budding yeast, a diffusible in-\nhibitor in the form of Rad53-mediated attenuation of Cdc7\nactivity has been shown to negatively regulate late origin fir-\ning in response to MMS treatment (for review see Jares et\nal., 2000). At present, we do not know if the block to repli-\ncation of undamaged DNA in our experiments acts at the\nlevel of origin utilization, chain elongation, or both.\n \nDetection of alkylation damage requires S phase entry\n \nAs detailed in the Introduction, genetic experiments in bud-\nding yeast have produced conflicting results as to whether\nalkylation damage can activate a checkpoint response out-\nside of S phase. In this work, we use four indicators of dam-\nage checkpoint activation to determine whether S phase en-\ntry is required for checkpoint activation in response to\nMMS-induced DNA damage. These indicators include mi-\ntotic delay, the block to replication of undamaged DNA,\nand the molecular markers Chk1 phosphorylation and phys-\n \nical association of the Rad17 checkpoint protein with dam-\naged DNA. In all four cases, we find that checkpoint activa-\ntion requires entrance into S phase. If entrance into S phase\nin extracts containing alkylated chromatin is blocked by pre-\nventing preRC formation with the Cdt1 inhibitor geminin,\nthen the extracts will enter mitosis, they will fail to phos-\nphorylate the Chk1 protein, and Rad17 does not associate\nwith the damaged DNA. Additionally, the diffusible signal\nthat damaged DNA generates to prevent replication of\nundamaged DNA requires that replication be initiated on\nthe damaged DNA. Thus, in \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts, alkylation\ndamage can only be sensed by the checkpoint after entrance\ninto S phase has occurred.\n \nReplication of dsDNA is required to generate \nthe DNA damage signal\n \nTo define the S phase event that is critical for checkpoint ac-\ntivation, we used simplified DNA templates and found that\nreplication on dsDNA, and not ssDNA, is required to gen-\nerate the damage signal. This implies that, at least for alkyla-\ntion damage detection in \n \nXenopus\n \n, ssDNA alone is not the\nsignal that activates the checkpoint. The finding that repli-\ncation on primed ssDNA templates also fails to activate the\ncheckpoint suggests that stalled DNA polymerases are insuf-\nficient to generate the signal, and indicates that the replica-\ntion structures that do generate the signal are specific for the\nreplication of dsDNA.\nWhat might these structures correspond to? In \n \nEsche-\nrichia coli\n \n, replication forks that are stalled by base lesions\nare processed in a manner that allows lesion bypass and\nreplication restart, and the biochemistry of these compli-\ncated reactions is becoming understood (for review see Cox\net al., 2000; Michel, 2000). Many of the processes that\npromote lesion bypass involve formation of Holliday junc-\ntions. Holliday junctions are four-stranded, cross-shaped\nDNA structures that are produced after replication fork re-\ngression and subsequent unwinding of the newly synthe-\nsized strands, which allows the nascent strands to anneal to\none another. Holliday junction formation allows the na-\nscent chain that was blocked by the lesion to be extended\nusing the nascent strand on its sister chromatid as a tem-\nplate. If such DNA rearrangements also occur in eukary-\notes, as seems likely, then one possibility is that the check-\npoint is activated by a nucleic acid structure that is present\nduring either formation, or resolution, of the Holliday\njunctions. This is consistent with our finding that check-\npoint activation requires replication of dsDNA, and not\nssDNA. A top priority for future work on the problem of\ndamage checkpoint activation will involve testing this hy-\npothesis by asking if synthetic nucleic acid structures that\nmimic Holliday junctions are capable of activating the\nDNA damage checkpoint in \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts.\n \nMaterials and methods\n \nXenopus\n \n egg extract preparation\n \nCycling extracts were prepared exactly as described by Murray (1991), ex-\ncept that calcium ionophore, at 0.5 \n \n\u0004\n \ng\/ml, was used to activate the eggs.\n100 \n \n\u0004\n \ng\/ml cycloheximide was added to the extracts to prevent protein syn-\nthesis, when noted.

To prepare MMS-treated sperm chro-\nmatin, purified sperm chromatin was soaked in buffer X (10 mM Hepes, pH\n7.4, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl\n \n2\n \n, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM sucrose, 3% BSA, 1\nmM DTT, 10 \n \n\u0004\n \ng\/ml aprotinin, 10 \n \n\u0004\n \ng\/ml leupeptin) containing 100 mM\nMMS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at RT with mild agitation. After incubation,\nthe MMS was removed by three rounds of washing with buffer X, and the\nsperm chromatin preparations were flash frozen and stored at \u000780 C.\nReplication assays\nTo measure DNA replication in NPE, sperm chromatin templates were in-\ncubated in HSS for 30 min to assemble chromatin and to allow preRCs to\nform on the DNA (Walter et al., 1998). After this incubation, 2 vol NPE\nwere added to initiate DNA synthesis. To analyze bulk DNA synthesis, the\nreaction products were electrophoresed on agarose gels exactly as de-\nscribed previously (Walter and Newport, 1999). Quantification was per-\nformed through exposure of the dried gels to Phosphorimager screens, and\nsubsequent analysis of the scanned images using the Molecular Dynamics\nsoftware package.\nChk1 phosphorylation assays\nChk1 phosphorylation assays, using the Chk1 \u0003KD construct, were per-\nformed exactly as described previously (Michael et al., 2000). The assay\nperformed in Fig. 1 B and Fig. 3 B used 35S-labeled Chk1 \u0003KD produced\nin rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The assay presented in Fig. 4 B used recombi-\nnant Chk1 \u0003KD produced in bacteria as described previously (Michael et\nal., 2000).\nChromatin isolation\nChromatin isolations were performed as follows: 50 \u0004l of cycling extract\ncontaining cycloheximide and sperm chromatin was incubated for 60 min,\ndiluted with 200 \u0004l of extract buffer (XB) (Murray, 1991), and layered over\n800 \u0004l of a sucrose cushion consisting of XB plus 870 mM sucrose in 1.5-\nml Eppendorf tubes. The samples were centrifuged in a Super T21 centri-\nfuge equipped with an ST-H50 rotor (Sorval) for 10 min at 6,000 rpm. After\ncentrifugation, the supernatants were removed, and the chromatin pellet\nwas resuspended in XB plus 0.6% Triton and recentrifuged through an\nidentical sucrose cushion. The supernatant was again removed and the\npellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.\nFluorescence-based DNA replication assays\nNPE replication assays were assembled as described above except that\nbio-dUTP (Boehringer) was added, to 10 uM, along with the NPE, and\n[32P]dATP was omitted. After 30 min of incubation, the samples were\nfixed, and spun through a sucrose cushion onto poly-L-lysine\u2013coated glass\ncoverslips as described previously (Walter and Newport, 1999).
