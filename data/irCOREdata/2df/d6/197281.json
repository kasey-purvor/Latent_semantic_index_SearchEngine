This is despite claims that we have recently been witnessing \n 2 \na relative \u201efeminisation\u201f of the sports crowd in England. Drawing mainly on interview data from \nmainstream female rugby union fans in the East Midlands city of Leicester, this article examines \naspects of women\u201fs early connections with sport and explores some of their defining experiences \nas sports fans. We begin by assessing the existing research agenda on male and female fandom, \nbefore saying something about the debate about the so-called \u201efeminised\u201f sports crowd. Our \nempirical findings focus on three key issues. Firstly, we consider the significance of early \nsporting experiences of female spectators; secondly we explore wider changes in women\u201fs \naccess to leisure time and their relation to new opportunities for women as sport spectators; and, \nthirdly, we examine aspects of women\u201fs changing experiences of watching sport in the context \nof the \u201efeminising\u201f debate. \n \nGender and fandom       \nAs academics interested in sport and leisure we often forget \u2013 perhaps to our cost \u2013 that the term \n\u201efan\u201f derives from the word \u201efanatic\u201f which, as Jenkins (1992: 13) reminds us, has \u201etraditional \nlinks to madness and demonic possession.\u201f However, specific associations are often made in this \ncontext that relate gender difference \u2013 and perhaps particularly types of femininity \u2013 to this rather \ngrim portrayal of the fan archetype (Harris, 1998). The \u201etypical\u201f image of female fandom \nrepresented here is of an enslaved victim; someone who is left, helplessly, \u201esobbing and \nscreaming and fainting, and assumes that an uncontrollable erotic energy is sparked by the \nchance to see or touch a male idol\u201f. Typical male fandom is also pathologised, of course, but in a \ndifferent way. It is usually one of, \u201edrunken destructiveness, a rampage of uncontrollable \nmasculine passion that is unleashed in response to a sports victory or defeat\u201f (Jenson 1992: 15).  \n \n 3 \nIn short, existing public rhetorics about and perceptions of female fans typically position them as \noverly-emotional at best, and as irrational and uncontrollable at worst. In some respects male \nfans come off equally badly \u2013 as stereotypically impassioned, often violent, partisans. In \nacademic research \u201etypical\u201f female fans are devotees of soap operas (Ang, 1991; Harrington and \nBielby, 1995; Spence, 2005); staunch viewers of reality TV shows (Kilborn, 2003); aficionados \nof pop bands (Cline, 1992; Ehrenreich, Hess and Jacobs, 1992; Hinerman, 1992); and star-\ncrossed followers of movies\/movie icons (Barbas, 2001; Taylor, 1989). But as Gosling (2007) \nand Mewett and Toffoletti (2008a) point out, women are not usually modelled as fans of sport, \nnot even in academic journals devoted to questions of sport and leisure.  \n \nMuch of the recent growth in research on sports fandom is characterised by a focus on changing \npatterns of consumption and, more especially in the United States, on quantitative studies driven \nby social psychology and sports marketing: a largely statistical concern aimed at measuring \nprimary motivations for fandom (see Chen, 2010; Clark et al., 2009; Funk et al \n2004; Robinson & Trail, 2005; Smith & Stewart, 2007; Wann. Melnick, Russell & Pease, 2001). \nIn the UK, this field is shaped rather differently. It has typically been more sociological and has \nfocused on the ways in which the \u201etraditional\u201f (male) working class sporting fan \u2013 usually soccer \nfans \u2013and the local audience for \u201elive\u201f sport have been argued to be increasingly threatened with \nmarginalisation or even exclusion from active sport spectatorship (King, 2002; Nash, 2000; \n2001; Williams & Perkins, 1998). This is due, it is argued, to the connected processes of \nglobalisation, gentrification, commodification and the television-promoted spectacularisation \n(and consequent cultural \u201eemptying out\u201f) which has characterised new directions in the \n 4 \nproduction and consumption of much late-modern professional sport, perhaps especially \nprofessional soccer (Conn, 1997; Giulianotti, 1999; Nash, 2000; Sandvoss, 2003).  \n \nWe have some sympathy with this work but we also think, pace Andrews\u201f and Ritzer\u201fs (2007) \nrecent critique of defenders of the primacy of local practices in late-modern sport, that it tends \ntowards an underdog populism and nostalgia concerning the privileging of the actor and the local \nin British sport\u201fs masculinist and cultish past. This approach is also married to a somewhat static \nand underdeveloped conceptualisation of social class and an underplaying of the very real social \nand cultural changes in the way young people today \u2013 including many young women \u2013 connect \nwith a wide range of cultural and leisure practices, including sport (see Williams, 2000). \nRelatively little attention has been focused in such accounts on the socialisation, fan career and \nnormative experiences of female sports fans. This is probably because women are accused of \nusurping men in the late-modern sports stadium by eroding this so-called last bastion of \nexclusive masculinity (Crolley & Long, 2001). Moreover, social science research also routinely \nmakes invisible the experiences of core, older sports fans drawn from a wide range of social \nbackgrounds. Recent critics of post-sub-cultural research on youth cultures stress how it has \nsidelined the \u201eordinary\u201f and the unspectacular in search of the expressive \u201eneo-tribes\u201f of the late-\nmodernity (Shildrick & MacDonald, 2006). The same is true, we would argue, of research on \nsports fans. It marginalises the large majority who are typically not directly involved in \ncollective processes of resistance or in highly expressive supporter cultures around their sport. \nBy their omission these subjects are implicitly labelled as silent (often middle class) passive \n\u201econsumers\u201f of sport: as market followers or \u201edupes\u201f who somehow lack the necessary cultural \n 5 \n\u201eauthenticity\u201f to interest academic researchers. For older, women sports fans this sort of \nmarginalisation can count as a double-exclusion. \n \nThose few existing studies of women sports fans typically posit them either as dysfunctional \npredators (Crawford & Gosling, 2004; Mewett & Toffoletti, 2008a), subordinate members of \nhooligan or ultras fan groups (Cere, 2003), or else as women differentially struggling to negotiate \nleisure space for themselves against the forces of historic forms of male sports privilege (see \nJones, 2008). These are all important areas for reflection and study, of course. The (mainly male) \nsubcultures of sports crowds require regular examination and exposure for their overly-\nmasculinised symbolic and material codes of exclusion. But women fans emerge here as \nincomplete ciphers and certainly as highly contingent members of the sporting community. Our \nown contention is that there is more to female sports fans than their depiction as maligned, over-\nsexualised and overly-assertive purveyors of heterosexual desire, or passive sidekicks to hyper-\ncommitted male terrace actors, or even their role as rather valiant, \u201eneo-feminist\u201f resisters. In this \nsense, our research revisits Dietz-Uhler, Harrick and End\u201fs (2000: 227) assertion that: \u201eFor \nfemales, being a sports fan means attending, watching and cheering at sporting events, preferably \nin the company of family and friends,\u201f primarily by responding to Free and Hughson\u201fs (2003) \ncalls to rectify the routine absence of female experiences and perspectives from academic work \non sports fandom.  Our work suggests that active female sports fans today exhibit a remarkably \nwide range of socialising influences, supporting styles, fan tropes, and \u201ecareer\u201f trajectories as \nfollowers of sport. We explore some of these matters in more detail below. \n \n \n 6 \nExisting research on female sports fans and questions of crowd \u2018feminisation\u2019  \nNotwithstanding our comments above, there is some qualitative work on female sports fans, but \nit is a sparse field and it is mainly focused on soccer. There are also small signs of a new \nemphasis in historical research on the early years of female sports fandom (see Lewis, 2009). An \nexception to this strong soccer focus is Crawford and Gosling\u201fs (2004) account of young female \nresistors to (male) perceptions of British women ice hockey fans that they are simply predatory \nheterosexual \u201epuck bunnies\u201f who stalk male players. Mewitt and Toffoletti\u201fs (2008a, 2008b) \nimportant recent work on female fans of Australian Football League (AFL) clubs centres on two \nissues: firstly, how women become fans of AFL clubs \u2013 like many men, it is mainly through \nfamily ties \u2013 and, secondly, the views of female fans on players\u201f publicly revealed sexual \nmisconduct against women. In terms of the former, here we do briefly hear the views of older \nfemale sports fans. In terms of the latter, younger female AFL fans divide between those who \nblame \u201epredatory women\u201f for triggering sexual desire among the players, and those who identify \na minority of \u201erogue men\u201f among professional sportsmen; athletes who exploit their sense of \nentitlement over women fans. In both accounts male footballers\u201f actions were ultimately justified \nby women by drawing simultaneously on socio-cultural and essentialist arguments about gender \nbehaviour. Mewitt and Toffoletti (2008a: 176) conclude that this strategy \u201ecreates a space for \nthem [women fans] to critique football culture while actively participating in it through their \nsupport of the game\u201f.  \n \nA similar gender ambiguity and identity tension is found in Katherine Jones\u201fs (2008) recent \nexcellent interview-based analysis of the experience of female soccer fans in Britain. Here the \nfocus is on how women engage with \u201einsulting\u201f masculine fan practices and the extent to which \n 7 \nsuch engagement affects their identities as both women and fans. Jones shows that three \nstrategies were adopted by female fans to respond to abusive masculine behaviour while \nnegotiating their own gender identities in a sporting context. Firstly, by defining sexist and \nabusive behaviour as \u201edisgusting\u201f women challenge the contemporary meaning and expression of \nmale soccer fandom. Secondly, by simply downplaying sexist and homophobic abuse some \nwomen rationalise it by arguing it is directed at both men and women, and is therefore \u201efunny\u201f \nand harmless, especially compared to racism. Thirdly, by embracing gender stereotypes as \u201epart \nof the game\u201f female fans effectively collude with hegemonic masculine definitions of \u201eauthentic\u201f \nfandom, thus distancing themselves from the \u201eemphasized femininity\u201f expressed by some female \nspectators which denotes they do not adequately \u201edo\u201f fandom. In effect, Jones explores the way \nin which the duality between women\u201fs fan and gender identities is negotiated: that is, in sports \ncrowds women typically demand to be identified as fans, rather than as female fans.   \n \nExploring connected terrain, Rodr\u00edguez (2005: 238) shows how in Argentina, women were \nconventionally depicted in the national soccer discourse in \u201edomestic roles\u201f (such as players\u201f \nwives or girlfriends), but that reactions to the soccer World Cup finals of 1998 demonstrated \nthat, \u201etheir fandom was legitimately accepted in the domain of representations; women at that \npoint became \u201cnational supporters.\u201d\u201f Sue Lopez (1997), similarly, has claimed that the 1966 \nWorld Cup win in England stimulated both a revival in English women\u201fs soccer and a surge of \ninterest among female spectators. But much later it was the television production values of \nWorld Cup Italia \u201f90, coupled with the marketing and modernisation brought by the commercial \nsynergy of satellite TV and the aggressively marketised FA Premier League, which sparked a \nspurt of female soccer match attendance in England (Williams, 2006). In Italy, the World Cup \n 8 \nsuccesses and the conventionally heterosexual \u201eglamour\u201f of the national team has been argued to \nbe one reason why Italian soccer often commands more heterosexual female support than in \nother equivalent European societies (Cere 2003: 168).  \n \nWe can see from even this brief review that processes of \u201efeminization\u201f in sports crowds may \nhave rather different meanings in different societies and contexts. In its most basic sense the term \nmight refer simply to the opening up of more opportunities for women to become active sports \nspectators. Greater acceptance of women, by male fans, as \u201eauthentic\u201f in their fandom might \nfollow, but we can also see that women have to \u201eearn\u201f this legitimacy, including by policing the \nacceptable boundaries of their own fandom. In Britain the notion of the more \u201efeminized\u201f crowd \nis also routinely bound up with the production of a preferred bourgeois \u201efamily audience\u201f for \nsport and it has often been used by sports clubs to refer to recent processes of stadium \nmodernisation (especially in soccer) and the associated range of presumed economic, social and \ncultural \u201ecivilising\u201f effects of having increasing numbers of female spectators present at largely \nmale sporting events (Crolley & Long, 2001). In Italy, Cere (2003: 184) argues that women-only \nultra groups (intensely partisan young Italian soccer fans), as well as women within male fan \ngroups, can bring \u201epositive changes to the curve, especially in the light of the increase in racist \nand violent culture among some groups\u201f, with the \u2018curve\u2019 or \u2018curva\u2019 depicting the area of the \nfootball stadium where the ultras congregate, usually the curved stand behind the goals.  \n \nElsewhere, \u201efeminization\u201f in the sports crowd has denoted the impact of the effective late-\nmodern marketing of the heterosexual attractiveness of sportsmen. For example, Kim (2004: 15) \ndescribes how South Korean women, \u201etransformed the soccer games into a space where they \n 9 \ncould project their sexual desires\u201f. Many South Korean female fans are typically depicted as \u201enot \neven knowing the rules [sic], but just liking the players\u201f (Kim 2004: 43). While, despite the \nsupposed recent \u201efeminization\u201f of Argentinean soccer, many men also \u201ebelieve women to be \nincapable of knowing anything about football, and they resist the idea that women can have a \n\u201creal\u201d passion\u201f for the sport (Rodr\u00edguez 2005: 234). Instead, in sports crowds, \u201ewomen\u201fs bodies \nbecome objects of some form of panoptic masculine gaze\u201f, and the male focus on \u201eyoung sexy \nwomen as a representation of all women\u201f means that the range of females involved and their \ndifferential motives as soccer fans, are generally ignored (Rodr\u00edguez 2005: 239-240). China and \nJapan have also been similarly identified as having domestic sporting cultures where, \u201ecelebrity \nfigures are more prominent to attract new, especially female, supporters\u201f (Giulianotti & \nRobertson 2004: 555). In all these examples \u2013 from the UK, Australia, South Korea, Argentina, \nJapan and Italy \u2013 and despite the growing prominence of female sports fans in each case \u2013 there \nseems little scope for exploring what might be the collective interests of female sports spectators, \nfor example by examining the extent and nature of continuities in spectator heritage for women \nor, indeed, by considering aspects of the relative de-domesticated heterogeneity of the female \nsport spectator experience today. Instead, spectator sport remains resolutely a place where it is \nlargely male identities which can apparently be \u201ecompleted\u201f (Rodr\u00edguez 2005: 233). In short, in \nthe late-modern stadium and despite recent changes in the make-up of sports crowds, sport still \ntends towards a \u201ehabituated action\u201f; a doxa, which serves in its reproduction as a gendered \ncultural sphere (Mewett & Toffoletti, 2008b: 7).  \n \n \n \n 10 \nA note on methodology  \nIn our own research on sports crowds in England we want to add to our knowledge of the largely \n\u201einvisiblised\u201f older, non-soccer female sports fan. We do this by briefly reporting on the sporting \nbackground, experiences and motivations of a sample of 22 older adult female fans of one \nprominent English professional rugby union club, the Leicester Tigers. These data have been \nextracted from a wider, comparative semi-structured interview study of female rugby union and \nsoccer fans in the English East Midlands city of Leicester (Pope, 2010). Our respondents were \ndrawn from a sampling frame of rugby union fans produced by a national postal questionnaire \nsurvey conducted in 2003 (Williams, 2003). The resultant recorded interviews typically lasted \nbetween one and two hours, and were usually conducted in the homes or work places of \nrespondents. All were conducted by a young female researcher and co-author of this paper; the \nfield researcher was often faced in this task by male (usually husband\/partner) intrusions or by \nother forms of male \u201epolicing\u201f of female research (Deem, 1986). This is a further indicator, of \ncourse, of the highly marginal role allocated by men, to women, as sports spectators (Pope, \n2008). \n \nUnusually for England, Leicester hosts prominent professional sports clubs in both the soccer \n(Leicester City FC) and rugby union codes, thus reflecting in one single urban location the \nhistoric social class and regional bifurcation of the rival male winter team sports in England \n(Harvey, 2005; Collins, 2009). Historically, club rugby in England drew much smaller crowds \nthan soccer, but the professionalization of rugby union in 1995, and its concomitant financing \nand promotion by satellite television, has recently brought these two winter team sports into a \nmore competitive situation with respect to fan recruitment and establishing a viable customer \n 11 \nbase. However, according to our fan survey data, compared to English soccer clubs Leicester \nTigers typically recruits a rather older, more affluent fan cohort, one which is more usually \ndrawn from the higher professional and non-manual social classes. Tigers\u201f fans are drawn from \nthe more desirable suburbs to the south of the city centre and from the cash-rich commuter urban \nvillages in South Leicestershire. Around 28% of Tigers season ticket fans are female, compared \nto around 24% of fans at soccer neighbours Leicester City (Williams, 2003; 2004).  \n \nAlthough rugby union in England has been growing in its wider economic and cultural \nimportance in the 15 years since professionalization, it has also maintained the social cache of \nbeing the winter team sport which appeals mainly to the male white English middle and upper \nclasses. Notwithstanding the recent relative \u201efeminization\u201f of rugby crowds \u2013 at least in terms of \nnumbers of female fans \u2013 rugby union also continues to prize its traditional role, as do tennis and \ngolf clubs in England, as a hub for complex networks of middle class male sociability (Stacey, \n1960). As Tony Collins (2006: 135) has pointed out, it is no accident that some English male \nrugby union fans still refer to their sport as \u201ea wonderful freemasonry\u201f; a place where business \nmight be conducted and men might gather to commune and network \u2013 ideally without the \ndistractions of women. The Tigers club recruits few active ethnic minority fans \u2013 all our female \ninterviews here are white \u2013 even though the city of Leicester is profoundly multi-cultural, \nincluding a large and well established South Asian community. Core, residual social class and \nethnicity distinctions between and within professional male team sports clearly remain a strong \nfeature of the sporting landscape in England, including in the city of Leicester. Let us now turn \nto our findings.  \n \n 12 \n \n \nFindings \nThe findings we present here focus on three key themes. Firstly, we examine women rugby \nunion fans\u201f early experiences of playing team sport and their interpolation with narratives about \nsports spectatorship; secondly, we consider the impact on sports attendance of changes in \nwomen\u201fs access to leisure time; and, finally, we address women\u201fs changing experiences of \nwatching rugby union in the new so-called \u201efeminised\u201f era. For reasons we have explored above, \nwe are looking primarily here at older female Leicester Tigers fans (22 fans aged over 35 years) \nbut very occasionally we do make reference to subjects in the larger host sample of Leicester \nsoccer and rugby fans we examined (N= 85). We refer to our interviewees by a simple letter and \nnumber code (F= female soccer fans, R= female rugby union fans). \n  \ni) Female rugby union fans\u2019 early experiences of sport \nMany boys are initially recruited as sports fans in England via the reflexive processes of \nfathering which ensure the normative early participation of (heterosexual) sons in contact team \nsport (see Kay, 2009). But for most female rugby union fans in England this avenue was \u2013 and is \n\u2013 simply unavailable. For the 22 female rugby fans we consider here, none had opportunities to \nplay school rugby or any similar contact male team sport. The only respondent in the wider \nproject on female rugby and soccer fans in Leicester who had any experience of playing rugby \nunion for a team was actually a younger soccer fan (F13), who had played briefly whilst at \nUniversity. At school, our female respondents were typically channelled away from sport or into \nplaying sports which, \u201eidealise popular images of femininity\u201f rather than challenge or question \n 13 \nthem (Hargreaves 1988: 140). One older fan, who grew up in northern England near the working \nclass rugby league stronghold of St Helens, discussed how educational and class identities often \ninterpolated with, and occasionally overlaid, those of gender in this respect: \n \n\u201eThe boys all played rugby union because that\u201fs what happened. We played rugby union \nin the grammar schools and rugby league was more working class, although we were all \nworking class\u2026So all my friends and my friends\u201f brothers and cousins all played rugby \nunion. So I used to go and watch school matches with them, but we all went to the \n[professional] rugby league matches.\u201f (R31, Age 57, season ticket holder, geneticist) \n \nAn underlying theme running through the comments in our sample was that boys and girls did \nnot typically \u201emix\u201f socially at school, let alone for PE lessons. In these accounts, even mixed \nschool settings were essentially still divided along sex lines, both spatially and culturally. In \nshort, established Victorian ideals and beliefs that women were antithetical to sport \u2013 inherently \nemotional, passive and gentle, unsuited for physical, competitive sport, the domain of men (see \nHargreaves, 2002; McCrone, 1987; Vertinsky, 1990) \u2013 had clearly survived relatively unscathed \nwell into the late 20\nth\n century experience of English schooling. These women were typically \nresigned about even the possibility of girls playing contact sport at school: their typical \nsocialisation, normative expectations and peer group assumptions automatically excluded them \neven from any distant consideration of team sport in this context: \n \n\u201eYou didn\u201ft particularly think it was anything unusual because that\u201fs the way it was. It \nwas only as you grow older and you suddenly realise, well, there\u201fs nothing stopping \nladies playing football or rugby or, you know, men playing netball if they want. It was \njust one of those things. That\u201fs how it was; it was put into categories and it was just \naccepted.\u201f (R16, age 53, season ticket holder, company secretary) \n \nPE teachers in England interviewed in an early study by Sheila Scraton (1992: 50, 57) similarly \ndismissed \u201emasculine\u201f sporting contact pursuits as naturally \u201eundesirable and unsuitable for \n 14 \ngirls\u201f, thus signalling a continuing, wider unwillingness among teachers in England to support \ngirls in \u201emale\u201f team sports (see Skelton, 2000; Swain, 2000; Welford and Kay, 2007). For our \nsample of older respondents educated in mixed-sex schools, compulsory sex segregation for PE \nmeant that there was usually a female sports teacher for the girls and a male sports teacher for the \nboys, a fact which, crucially, also contributed to the normatively and stringently gendered \nconsumption of sport as fans in both school and non-school settings:  \n \n\u201eThe boys would go to Twickenham [the RFU HQ] or [\u2026] the football master would \nhave taken the boys to Wembley to see perhaps schoolboy football. But [\u2026] we would \ntake the girls to Wembley to watch the women\u201fs hockey, as it was then. Cos that was a \nbig thing then in the late 60s, early 70s, to go and watch England ladies play hockey.\u201f \n(R17, age 55, season ticket holder, clerk) \n \nA small number of active rugby union fans had explored the \u201etomboy\u201f identity option as \nyoungsters, partly as a means of achieving better access to male play and team sport. For \nPaechter (2006) this acting as an \u201ehonorary boy\u201f means rejecting some of the disempowerment \nthat comes with conventional femininity. Although these respondents typically remember being \nseen as \u201estrange\u201f and \u201eodd\u201f by \u201emore feminine\u201f girls, the confidence and enjoyment gained from \nthis tomboy persona was an empowering experience (see Cox & Thompson, 2000; Paechter, \n2006; Reay, 2001). For R22 (the only rugby interviewee who had actually played any junior \nrugby, albeit informally in family settings), assuming and performing a version of \u201emasculinity\u201f \nin a largely male setting also helped shape her (often contradictory) gender identity later:  \n \n\u201eI always think I\u201fm a very unwomanly woman, cos \u2013 apart from the fact I have 50 pairs \nof high-heeled shoes (laughs) \u2013  I\u201fm not into soap operas and I\u201fm not into America\u2019s Next \nTop Model [reality TV show]\u2026My idea of a perfect day is to take my dogs out for a run, \nhave a quick shower and watch the rugby [\u2026].We watch sport [\u2026] then films, I like \nthings like Terminator and Star Wars; I\u201fm not into chick flicks, they irritate me\u2026I don\u201ft \ndo things like that and I never have done. But I think it\u201fs probably my upbringing. It was \n 15 \na very male dominated household, my dad and my brothers, so that\u201fs how I was brought \nup.\u201f (R22, age 48, season ticket holder, part-time teacher and designer) \n \nThere was widespread opposition in the sample to the idea that young females might routinely \nplay rugby. Its aggressively invasive nature, combined with the very real risk of injury, often \nmeans that mothers oppose that their daughters \u2013 and indeed, in some cases, their sons \u2013 might \nbe recruited to play competitive rugby. The recent women\u201fs rugby union World Cup finals, \nsuccessfully held in England in 2010, might yet challenge dominant ideologies in this arena (see \nGallagher, 2010). But this quite strong resistance among \u201esporting\u201f women to more female \ncontact play is often rooted in highly essentialist assumptions. It views rugby as a deeply \ntransgressive form of violent risk-taking; one which is simply just too challenging to sanction: \n \n\u201eIt worries me that they [women] play. [\u2026]. It worries me about the long-term effects of, \nif you\u201fre playing on a regular basis, and the contact. Because we\u201fre different from men, \nyou know, from an anatomy point of view. We\u201fre very different [\u2026].  If you\u201fre being \nknocked to the ground regularly I just wonder about our internal organs and the way \nwe\u201fre made really.\u201f (R19, age 54, season ticket holder, direct payments advisor) \n \n \nii) Changes in women\u2019s access to leisure time \nBy contrast to their own early experiences of sporting opportunity, our respondents used \nempowering terms such as: \u201eindependent\u201f; \u201estrong minded\u201f; \u201efreer\u201f; and \u201emore forceful\u201f to \ndescribe the social condition of \u201eyounger\u201f women today. This new generation were seen, \ngenerally approvingly, as spirited and more reflexive agents, actors who will, \u201eDo what they \nwanna do. Sod it, if it\u201fs not stereotypical\u201f. One of the possible outcomes here is women \ndemanding \u2013 and acquiring \u2013 more latitude at spectator sports events. Seventeen out of the 22 \nolder fans interviewed agreed that the proportion of female fans at Tigers matches had increased \n 16 \nsince professionalization in 1995.  Notions of some kind of wider socio-structural \u201egender \nconvergence\u201f in this context, which has allowed all women greater freedom and choice, remains \na deeply contentious one of course (Wilkinson, 1994: 37). Such changes are at best uneven and \nthey are highly refracted by the effects of interlocking inequalities along the fissures of cultural \ndifference, age, race and class. For example, for R24 \u2013 and after a brief flirtation with soccer \u2013 it \nwas not until all her children had grown up and left home that she felt she could pursue her own \nfan \u201ecareer\u201f at the Tigers: \u201eRugby came when it was my turn to do what I wanted to do\u201f. As \nGreen, Hebron and Woodward (1990: ix) point out, for most women leisure cannot be explored \nin isolation from other parts of their lives: a woman\u201fs \u201eright\u201f to leisure is heavily \u201ecircumscribed \nby her employment status and income level, her family situation and most important, her lack of \nstatus as a woman in a patriarchal society\u201f. Similarly, Aitchison (2003: 42) claims that defining \nleisure as \u201efree time\u201f raises issues for many women for whom freedom is dependent on the \nfinancial support of a male partner or their role as primary care providers for others. This is also \none reason why some heterosexual men still feel they can control \u2013 or attempt to control \u2013 their \nfemale partners\u201f leisure time. \n \nThe occupational background of our sample suggests they are likely to have more financial \nindependence than many other women, but the link between more general changes in family life \nand the work sphere and the growing opportunities for women\u201fs leisure time was also crucial \nhere, recalling especially Rosemary Deem\u201fs (1986: 40) early assertion that men feel they had a \n\u201eright to leisure\u201f whereas many women do not. Our respondents broadly concurred that, with \nmore women in waged work today \u2013 some as the main family breadwinner \u2013 women now feel as \nentitled to leisure time today as do men: \n 17 \n \n\u201eI don\u201ft know whether that\u201fs just the way of the world, if you like [\u2026] The fact that \nyou\u201fve got more women at work and possibly some households have perhaps got a little \nbit more disposable income because they\u201fve got two incomes, they can afford for them \n[male and female] both to go [to rugby] [\u2026] Or whether because women have become \nmore independent and perhaps more assertive, they make their own choices a little bit \nmore. And I think you know, people get married later [\u2026] and possibly having children \nlater. So they\u201fre not at home tied up with the children [\u2026]. I don\u201ft know whether those \nthings connected.\u201f (R20, Age 37, season ticket holder, financial director) \n \nAttending sport with a husband or partner may once have seemed to reluctant women like a \nrather desperate way to stake a claim for more joint leisure time. But the perception today is that \nmore women \u2013 especially, perhaps, those in more elevated class positions \u2013 are in a position to \nmake their own choices, in terms of both their leisure and the time spent in the company of  men. \nAs R16 points out: \n \n\u201eI would think, going back quite a long way, football and rugby [were] predominantly \nmale, because that was the men\u201fs time, that\u201fs what they did. So whether that\u201fs changed \nnow because\u2026we tend to mix more.... We don\u201ft have just female time and male time \n[\u2026]. It\u201fs not \u2026\u201cThat\u201fs a man-only thing. We all meet up in the pub and then we go and \nwatch. And women aren\u201ft included\u201d\u201f. (R16, Age 53, season ticket holder, company \nsecretary) \n \nThis relative attrition of distinctions typically drawn between \u201emale time\u201f and \u201efemale time\u201f in \nsport (and perhaps other) contexts is obviously a significant feature of recent developments in the \nlived experience of heterosexual couples. But how have women experienced these recent \nchanges in the new so-called \u201efeminized\u201f era of late-modern sport? We turn to this issue in the \nfinal section. \n \n \n \n 18 \n \niii) Women\u2019s changing experiences of watching sport \nAmateur post-war English club rugby union offered basic facilities for spectators at best. \nAccounts from older female fans of their early experiences of these male spaces are rare. As one \nof our more seasoned interviewees described it:  \n \n\u201eI remember we used to stand behind the goal at the Welford Road end which was just a \nmud bank\u2026.. There used to be about ten of us altogether, and as I say I was eleven when \nI went down, but my dad didn\u201ft want to take me\u2026. Well in those days, I mean, where the \nCrumbie Standing is, there just used to be a few people in the middle. That\u201fs all. Nothing \nlike how it is today.  (R25, age 70, season ticket holder, retired- worked as a machinist \nsupervisor) \n \nFollowing professionalism in 1995, rugby union attendances rose rapidly in England, provoking \na period of stadium modernisation to match the aspirations and demands of the sport\u201fs new \nfinancers and customers. The Leicester Tigers for example, \u201emodernised\u201f by building new stands \nand incorporating and extending bespoke executive facilities at Welford Road. Whilst these \ndevelopments have been paraded locally as part of the club\u201fs more inclusive appeal to a new \n\u201efamily\u201f audience for rugby, they are also deeply rooted in plans to tap into regional corporate \nmarkets (Crowson, 2010).  For our female respondents these reconstituted facilities, which also \nincluded a new club shop and more places to eat and drink at the ground, were part of a wider \nproject to create a more seductive \u201eprofessional atmosphere\u201f (R17) around English rugby. But \nnot all respondents approved of the attempts to air-brush away the more visceral aspects of \nspectating in earlier periods. Recent attempts to get the club to share the nearby Walkers (soccer) \nStadium, for example, were strongly opposed by both older and younger female Tigers fans. \n 19 \nInstead, they expressed strong visceral attachments to the unique history and traditions of \nWelford Road: \n \n\u201eThere\u201fs something about the Tigers ground. There\u201fs just something about the place. \nWhen they were going to move us to the Walkers [Stadium], you know, I really didn\u201ft \nwant to move. It\u201fs just something I want to\u2026. I took the grandchildren, but it\u201fs \nsomething I want my grandchildren\u201fs children to go to. You know, it becomes part of \nyou, I think.\u201f (R33, age 57, season ticket holder, computer supervisor) \n \n \n\u201eOne of my favourite places in the world is Welford Road; it just is magic when you get \nin [\u2026]. I love it. I love\u2026just the smell. Where we stand, we\u201fre near the [players\u201f] tunnel, \ncos that\u201fs where the players sit. I can be anywhere and get a whiff of Deep Heat. I\u201fm on \nthe terrace in the rain smelling Deep Heat on a Friday night or a Saturday afternoon. \n\u2026I\u201fve not been to another stadium that has made me feel like Welford Road feels; there \nis a buzz about the place.\u201f  (R1, Age 25, season ticket holder, principal office clerk) \n \n \nMcDowell (1999: 11) points out that there are deep-seated and highly gendered assumptions \nabout the \u201enatural\u201f and built environments; about who should occupy space and who should be \nexcluded. It often requires energy and organisation to gain even the most basic acknowledgement \nof women\u201fs presence in buildings (Darke, 1996). Thus, there is a continued requirement to \nhighlight the apparent \u201enaturalness\u201f of gender and spatial divisions within the architecture of the \n\u201eman\u201fs world\u201f of everyday sporting life. This means that despite the professionalism and the \n\u201eimproved\u201f facilities at Welford Road in the supposed new feminized era of the sport, impacted \npatriarchal design raised familiar and bitter complaints from women and predictable calls for \nwhat many regarded as necessary change. As one of our respondents put it: \n \n\u201eThe gripe, gripe, gripe that I have is ladies toilets. Lack of them: and lack of\u2026 just \ngeneral understanding of what a lady might want in a toilet! [....] And I\u201fve complained \nabout it before but it falls on deaf ears [\u2026]. My view is it is a man\u201fs club; it is a man\u201fs \nworld and until women start to get on the board or whatever [\u2026] But I don\u201ft think that\u201fs \n 20 \ngoing to happen for a few years yet.\u201f (R14, age 45, season ticket holder, learning \nmentor) \n \nCollins (2009) has suggested that the arrival of professionalism has made rugby union much \nmore \u201efashionable\u201f than hitherto and for our respondents part of this trajectory has involved the \nways in which, with full-time salaries and vigorous training regimes, senior players had worked \nand toned their bodies and become \u201eleaner and fitter today\u201f (R25) and thus more obviously \nattractive to heterosexual female fans (R13, R17, R19, R20, R23, R24, R26, R29, R30, R34).  \nConnected to this point, our respondents routinely aligned their sport to a morally superior \nmasculinity code compared to that at soccer \u2013 to a benign and honourable version of Connell\u201fs \n(1995) dominant \u201ehegemonic masculinity.\u201f For example, they typically ridiculed soccer fans for \nfollowing and playing a sport allegedly characterised by \u201esubordinate\u201f forms of masculinity in a \nway that drew on class-inflected forms of difference and obviously homophobic connotations: \n \n\u201eA City supporter would say that soccer is a really skilful game, but a rugby player, a \nrugby supporter would probably\u2026. make some derogatory comment about how weak \nthey are, or namby-pambys, you know. They\u201fd be a bit more homophobic than that, if \nyou get what I\u201fm saying (laughs). They\u201fd basically say you\u201fre a woman or you\u201fre a \npoofter, you know, that sort of comment. It doesn\u201ft take much to play soccer, but to play \nrugby you\u201fve got to be a real man (laughs).\u201f (R19, Age 54, season ticket holder, direct \npayments advisor) \n \nThis recent development of player body capital and the promotion of \u201ereal men\u201f in rugby union \nwas coupled for our respondents with the way that saturation television coverage had \u201eopened \nup\u201f sport for women in recent years \u2013 thus making rugby union more accessible and more \nintelligible to new spectators via the media\u201fs glitzy presentational styles and its increasing focus \non \u201epersonalities\u201f (R14, R17, R19, R32). These new corporeal attractions, enhanced by an \nextended media coverage and innovative marketing techniques in the age of celebrity, are argued \n 21 \nto have brought new women followers into the sport \u2013 who may then go on to become more \nknowledgeable about its core features: \n \n\u201eThere\u201fs a huge amount of television coverage now then there ever was. You know, you \nwould get one game a year, the John Player Cup, and you would get the internationals on \nthe TV, and that would be it... Now\u2026 obviously with Sky you know, you\u201fve got this \nweekend full, Friday night to Sunday night solid...It was the popularity of the game and \nthe awareness raising of the game that obviously has brought them [new women] into it.\u201f \n(R14, Age 45, season ticket holder, learning mentor) \n  \n \n\u201eThe pin ups, the Johnny Wilkinsons and that sort of thing.  It might get women \ninterested to start with. And, hopefully they get interested in the game then and not just\u2026 \n(laughs).\u201f (R13, Age 42, season ticket holder, housewife) \n \nBut perhaps partly because of the impact of some of these recent changes, our interviewees also \nknew full well that they were still expected routinely to demonstrate publicly to men their \nknowledge and commitment as sports fans. For example, R29 described how men often \u201etest\u201f \nwomen\u201fs knowledge so: \u201eYou\u201fve got to prove you know what you\u201fre talking about, whereas \nwomen just assume that other men know what they\u201fre talking about\u201f. This questioning of \nsporting authenticity and loyalty among female fans could perhaps best be seen: \u201eas an \nexpression of men\u201fs fears over women invading their traditionally masculine space\u201f (Gosling, \n2007: 260). It also presents women fans with the complex challenges of routinely negotiating in \ntheir sports practices the gender paradox \u2013 the demonstration of competency and knowledge by \n(lower status) females in roles traditionally claimed by (higher status) men in the context of \nhegemonic masculinity (Martin, Schouten and McAlexander, 2006: 183). In this sense \u2013 and \ndespite the prevailing rhetorics about feminising sporting cultures \u2013  women sports fans still \nregularly contest male condescension in sporting landscapes and also face the fact that they are \nmainly tolerated in sports crowds as, at best, \u201ehonorary\u201f males (Ben-Porat, 2009: 888).   \n 22 \n \n \nConclusion \nOur main aim in this paper has been to begin to explore the experiences of a sample of usually \ninvisible, \u201eordinary\u201f female sports fans in England as a means of countering the dominant \nqualitative research focus in sport on more \u201espectacular\u201f male fans. We have also aimed to begin \nto unpack and challenge some of the common assumptions about the extent to which \u2013 and in \nwhat ways \u2013 late-modern sports crowds and sports spaces have become \u201efeminized.\u201f In this \ncontext we have effectively been exploring multiple feminisms: ways in which some women see \nsports spectatorship as part of an identity project in which they expand, complicate and empower \ntheir own femininities (Martin et al, 2006: 190), while for others it offers something closer to a \ncontingent form of gender tourism (Moore, 1988.) We have concentrated mainly here on \nexamining the views and experiences of a small sample of older female rugby union fans of the \nLeicester Tigers club in the East Midlands of England. This is as a counter to the tendency \u2013 in \nEurope at least \u2013 to assume that fan experiences from soccer can easily be generalised to all \nsports.  \n \nWe have been restricted by space to examining empirically, very briefly, three core themes \nwhich have come out of a wider research project on female sports spectators in Leicester: the \nearly sporting experience of female rugby fans and its possible relation to the production later of \nfemale sports spectator \u201ecareers\u201f; the extent to which wider social and cultural changes in gender \nrelations have helped shape and inform recent female sports fan experiences in England; and, \nfinally, the changing experience of women rugby union fans of sporting cultures, stadium spaces \n 23 \nand sporting places against the backcloth of a new media agenda for sport and a generally \n\u201emasculinised\u201f discourse about English sporting traditions and heritage. Taken together, these \nthree strands begin to map elaborate patterns of continuities and change in women\u201fs often hidden \nexperiences as sports fans and start to sketch out their impact on English sporting landscapes and \ncultures. This is even though English rugby union has only really begun to see itself as a serious \ncompetitor in the marketplace for sports customers \u2013 and for female fans \u2013 in the last two \ndecades.   \n \nSome of the common tropes of the supposed recent \u201efeminization\u201f of the English sports crowd \u2013 \nspectator gentrification; the promotion of heterosexual player glamour and celebrity; the \nattractions of modern, rationalised stadia to the \u201efamily\u201f audience for sport; the relative wider \nempowerment of women and their increasing opportunities to play contact team sport; and the \ngreater relative acceptance of women by men as \u201eauthentic\u201f sports spectators \u2013 all play out in \nsome respect here. But they also do so only in complex, contradictory and often contested ways. \nThe issue of female \u201eentitlement\u201f to their own personal histories as fans, the changing nature of \nthe meaning of spectator sport for younger female sports fans raised in a period suffused with the \nvortex of celebrity (Whannel, 2002), and the intimate and visceral seductions of traditional sports \nspaces and sports heritage for some female spectators, offer themselves as potential channels for \nfuture research and we are beginning to address some of these issues ourselves. It will be \nimportant to examine questions of empowerment and resistance around the existence and \nperformance of women spectators in different sports to soccer and the one we have briefly \nconsidered here, rugby union.  \n \n 24 \nFinally, the extent to which the greater presence of women in sports crowds today, in and of \nitself, constitutes a process of \u201efeminization\u201f in sporting cultures remains a deeply contentious \nissue, as we have tried to illustrate here. Indeed, some of the ways in which our own respondents \nconceptualise gender difference in sporting contexts and the manner in which, for example, TV \ncoverage of sport \u2013 including rugby union \u2013 \u201enaturally\u201f pans to conventionally attractive young \nfemale faces in sports crowds during gaps in play, demonstrates both the increasingly central role \nyounger women play in the marketing of spectator sport today, but also that many of the \nestablished conventions around the gender\/sport axis remain relatively undisturbed by recent \nchanges. To what extent women as active fans bring quite different behaviour patterns, \nsensibilities and values to late-modern sports stadia is a question we have at least begun to \nembark upon. It is one which clearly needs to continue to be addressed both theoretically and \nempirically. In short, we need much more research on these previously \u201einvisible\u201f and largely \nunconsidered fans of professional spectator sport in order to illuminate marginalised voices \nwithout the limitations of a single critical perspective (Martin et al, 2006: 191). This is not least \nbecause the growing number of active female sports fans and their increasing visibility at sports \nstadia is routinely advertised today by those who govern global sport as a signal of spectator \nsport\u201fs transformative, progressive potential. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 25 \n \n \nReferences \nAitchison, C.
