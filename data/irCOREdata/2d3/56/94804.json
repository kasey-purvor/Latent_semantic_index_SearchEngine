Personal contacts with the police are likely to be of key importance in \ninfluencing many people\u2019s opinions about the police. It is therefore unfortunate that confidence is lower \namong people who have had recent contact with officers. This article first summarises evidence in this area \nfrom the BCS and surveys run by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). Falls in public confidence over the \nlast 20 years are shown to have been mirrored by growing dissatisfaction with personal contact, but evidence \nis also outlined which suggests that well-handled contacts can have a positive impact. Discussion then moves \non to consider how the MPS is using survey data to improve police handling of interactions with the public. \nCommunication between officers and public \u2013 of information, of fairness and respect, and of police presence \n\u2013 appears to be of key importance.\n 2\nIntroduction \nOver the past decade, public confidence in policing \u2013 measured in the Assessments of  Policing and Community \nSafety (APACS) framework by  \u2018how good a job do people think the police do in their local area\u2019 \u2013 has become a \nkey element of police performance. It is Government concern about the decline in public confidence over the past \ntwo decades (Reiner, 2000; Roberts & Hough, 2005) that has placed this indicator at the heart of the police \nperformance framework from 2003.  Yet, despite falling crime rates and some improvement in public confidence \nin policing over the past few years, there is not been a step-change in the way people say they experience the \n\u2018services\u2019 of local policing.     \n \nEvidence suggests that personal contact and police visibility are of central importance in the formation of public \nconfidence and police legitimacy (Fitzgerald et al., 2002; Skogan 2006; Tyler, 2006; Bradford, Jackson and \nStanko in press). The 05\/06 British Crime Survey (BCS) found that around 39 per cent of adults across England \nand Wales had some form of personal contact1 with the police (Jansson n.d.). BCS and other data suggest that \npublic encounters with the police often seem to lead to a decline in public confidence, and with the exception of \ntrain services, the apparent negative impact of direct contact is different to people\u2019s experiences with other public \nservices.  People are more likely to express satisfaction with the National Health Service (NHS), for example, if \nthey are current or recent users of NHS services (Ipsos MORI, 2007).  But those who have had no recent contact \nwith the police are more likely  to feel they are doing a good job than those who have not (e.g. Allen et al., 2006; \nBradford, Jackson and Stanko in press; Fitzgerald et al. 2002; Cabinet Office 2003).  \n  \nPublic confidence is currently being addressed through a wide range of improvement programmes across UK \npolicing, linked to Citizen Focussed Policing (Cabinet Office 2003 \u2013 a notable example is the ACPO Quality of \nService Commitment). Developments in neighbourhood policing seek to increase the frequency and quality of \npolice-public encounters, and aspire to improve public confidence and feelings of security (Innes 2007). This \npaper outlines the latest London School of Economics\/Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) research on contact \nand confidence, and documents how the Met is using research evidence to inform policy and practice.  In the first \nsection we outline the extent, nature and consequences of public contact with the police.  We draw on data from \nover 20 years of the BCS to outline some key trends in contact and confidence and we summarise findings from \nrecent MPS studies exploring the impact of contact on confidence. We consider the importance of personal \ncontacts in the formation of public opinions about the police; and we show that there are ways to improve \npeople\u2019s experiences of contact.  In the second section we discuss how the issues raised by the research are being \nused by the MPS to inform such improvements, paying particular attention to the importance of communicating \ninformation to the public. \n \nContact with the police and public confidence in policing: Lessons from the British Crime Survey \nUK academic and political interest in the extent, nature and consequences of personal contacts with the police \nwas ignited in the early 1980s with the publication of Police and People in London (Smith & Gray, 1985), \nreports of the Islington Crime Survey (e.g. Jones et al., 1986) and Home Office research including the first report \nof the British Crime Survey (Hough & Mayhew, 1983).  The first of these studies \u2013 now considered a classic \npiece of criminology \u2013 attempted not only to map out who had contact with the police, but also to show how the \npublic felt about these encounters and what impact these encounters had on public confidence in the police \n(Smith & Gray, 1985).  Much of this work was conducted in the aftermath of the Brixton, St Paul\u2019s and other \nriots of the early 1980s, so discussion of the findings was often rooted in debates about confrontations between \npolice and Black Caribbean and other marginalised youth. \n \nAs the debate matured2 questions about public confidence were embodied in England and Wales\u2019 first police \nperformance assessment framework (PPAF).  And the BCS became the primary tool used to capture data on \npublic confidence in, and contact with, the police. BCS reports have shown that confidence in local policing (as \nmeasured by asking individuals how good or bad a job they think their local police are doing) fell between 1984 \nand 2001.  Since then it has remained relatively steady \u2013 and has even increased slightly in recent years.3   \n \nMight this fall in public confidence over the 1980s and 1990s be partly attributed to an increase in the proportion \nof people having contact with police, given that personal contact with the police to be associated with lower \nlevels of public confidence?  Figure 1 suggests not. BCS data indicates a marked decline in public self-initiated \ncontacts (police-initiated contacts have also declined, but to a much lower degree) over the past two decades \u2013 a \npattern that mirrors the fall in victimisation (with lower levels of crime, perhaps there are fewer reasons to initiate \ncontact with the police).   \n 3\n \nFigure 1 near here \n \nYet it may be that levels of public satisfaction with contact have changed over time, and that this partly explains \nfalling levels of confidence. Reductions in confidence may not be explained by a greater number of police-public \nencounters, but it might be that more and more of those encounters people do have with the police are found to \nbe unsatisfactory in some way. US research conducted by Tom Tyler and colleagues has shown that public \nperceptions of the ways that people are treated by authorities like police officers can be important in influencing \nideas both about the legitimacy of the authority and subsequent cooperation with it. If people feel they are treated \nfairly and decently by the police they are more likely to comply with officer\u2019s instructions (Tyler 1990; Tyler and \nHuo 2002). So it might be that falling confidence in policing in England and Wales over the past two decades can \nbe partly explained by growing dissatisfaction with police handling of contacts among the public. \n \nFigure 3 shows that dissatisfaction with self-initiated contacts has indeed increased significantly since the early \n1990s, and that assessments of police-initiated contacts which are not street or car stops have also worsened. In \ncontrast, people\u2019s dissatisfaction with being stopped by police whilst driving has not grown, suggesting that \npolice attempts to manage such stops better may have had some impact on how people feel they are treated \n(Shiner 2006; Miller, Quinton and Bland 2000). It is also worth noting that levels of dissatisfaction appear to \nhave stabilised in the last few years (mirroring the stabilisation of confidence over the same period, see Figure 1). \n \nFigure 2 near here \n \nWhy is contact with the police so important? \nDespite the undoubted importance of media and other social representations in informing and even moulding \nopinions about the police (Mawby 2002; Leishman and Mason 2003) \u2013 and despite decreasing levels of both \npublic confidence and police contact \u2013 it thus seems likely that personal experience will remain a key factor for \nmany people  (for US evidence on this see: Reisig and Parks 2000; Schuck and Rosenbaum 2005; Tyler and \nFagan 2006; and Skogan, 2006). Moreover, vicarious experience \u2013 stories told by others about the police \u2013 may \nbe equally, if not more, important (Miller et al. 2004; Rosenbaum et al. 2005), implying that the effects of \npersonal experience may spread beyond those directly involved (cf. Sunshine & Tyler, 2003a).  \n \nAs noted above the overall effect of contact on confidence appears to be negative; trust and confidence in the \npolice is lower among those who have recent contact (Skogan 1990; Allen et al. 2006; Fitzgerald et al. 2002). \nFurthermore, the negative association between contact and confidence appears to arise mainly from contacts that \nare found to be unsatisfactory in some way by the members of public involved. Studies have also found that well-\nreceived contacts do not appear to have a commensurate positive effect. Some leading researchers go so far as to \nsuggest that police can do little to enhance opinions by improving the quality of their interactions with the public \n(Skogan 2006; Smith 2007). \n  \nThere are indeed many reasons to suggest that negative impacts from personal experience will be greater than \npositive, such that contact overall damages confidence. These largely centre on the peculiar, and peculiarly \ndifficult, role of the police. At different times (occasionally even at the same time) the police represent to the \npublic both a service and an agent of enforcement, which, crucially, is only rarely able to offer them concrete \noutcomes.  On an instrumental or material level, for example, relatively few encounters with the police initiated \nby victims of crime are likely to result in a favourable outcome in terms of sanctions applied to the offender \n(arrest or a prosecution) or the return of stolen property. Those stopped by officers will, at the very least. be \ninconvenienced by police actions. It is often hard for the police to \u2018return\u2019 to the public what they have lost, \neither in terms of the crime experienced or the inconvenience or humiliation felt as a result of being a target of \npolice suspicion. \n \nFurthermore, it is frequently suggested that the police are representatives, even embodiments, of law and order, \nthe nation-state or the dominant social group, and that such aspects of the police image are vital in people\u2019s \nexperiences of personal contact (Jackson & Sunshine, 2007; Loader 2006; Sunshine & Tyler, 2003b; Tyler 1990; \nWaddington 1999). Such ideas imply that people\u2019s interpretations of police-public encounters may involve issues \nfar beyond the control of the individual officers present because people feel the impact of police actions in the \ncontext of their relationships to much broader social structures or situations. For example, if the police are seen \n 4\nby those from socially marginalised or excluded groups as representatives of a repressive state, then contact with \nofficers may be experienced in a negative way whatever they do. \n \nA glimmer of hope? Lessons from the London Metropolitan Police Service\u2019s Public Attitude Survey \nThere is much, then, to suggest that during face-to-face interactions it will be more difficult for police to improve \nopinions than to damage them. However with the inclusion of an indicator in the national performance \nframework that measures public confidence this is precisely what is now expected from British policing. In \npractical terms, the question now becomes: how can we best advise on a practical way forward?  In this light it is \nperhaps reassuring that there is some emerging evidence in the MPS and in the USA that contacts judged to be \nsatisfactory by the public can have some small positive impact on opinions of the police (from the UK, see \nBradford, Jackson and Stanko in press; Bradford 2008; from the US see Schuck and Rosenbaum 2005; Tyler and \nFagan 2006). Recent analysis of the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Public Attitude Survey has shown that well-received \ncontact is associated with small but significant increase in opinions about police fairness and, in some cases, level \nof engagement with the community (Bradford, Jackson and Stanko in press).  These elements \u2013 fairness and \npositive engagement with the community \u2013 are key drivers of public confidence.  Moreover, further MPS \nresearch shows that positive effects from well-handled encounters among recent crime victims appear to be \ngreater than those occurring among others who come into contact with the police, although there is some \nquestion over the longevity of these (Bradford 2008). \n   \nThe association between contact and confidence may then not be inevitably negative, as Skogan (2006) has \nargued.  If officers manage the public well, an increase in confidence may result. The procedural justice model \ndeveloped by Tyler and colleagues (Lind and Tyler 1988; Tyler 1990; Tyler and Huo 2002),  powerfully suggests \none way in which such improvements might come about: it is treatment perceived to be fair and equitable that is \nmost likely to result in improved trust and confidence. Judgements among the public about policing appear to \nplace less emphasis on concrete outcomes, such as the return of property or being stopped in public after a minor \ntraffic infringement, and more emphasis on the quality of that personal encounter. This suggests that public \nopinions can be enhanced by those aspects of encounters over which officers have most control \u2013 the ways in \nwhich they treat people and communicate their decisions.  \n \nPerceptions about more diffuse contacts and behaviours have also been found to be important. Fitzgerald et al. \n(2002) suggested that a visible and accessible police force was a key priority for Londoners not because they \nthought this would solve crime problems per se but because more \u2018bobbies on the beat\u2019 would help secure the \ntrust and co-operation of local people (ibid: 48). Recent MPS analysis has supported this, linking perceptions of \nincreased police visibility in the local area to more favourable views about police effectiveness, fairness and \ncommunity engagement. Feeling more informed about police activities (for example by leaflet drops) was also \nassociated with higher confidence in local policing (Bradford, Jackson and Stanko in press). \n \nIn sum, while some studies have found evidence to suggest that positive outcomes in terms of trust and \nconfidence can emerge from personal contacts, others find such effects are small or non-existent. The balance of \nthe evidence seems to be that, on the one hand, unsatisfactory contacts with the police, whether initiated by the \npublic or by officers, can have very significant negative impacts on people\u2019s confidence in policing. On the other \nhand, the effects of satisfactory contacts, while not of the same magnitude, are not entirely a zero as some have \nsuggested. What almost all researchers agree on, however, is that personal contact can influence people\u2019s ideas \nabout the police, sometimes in a very major way, underlining the importance of well-handled police-public \ninteractions for public confidence in the police. What we have learned since the early 1980s is that it matters how \npolice treat people, especially those who come to them for help and assistance.  Simply, contact counts, even if \nthe most we can hope for is the prevention of damage to trust and confidence among the public as a result of \npersonal experience. \n \nUsing the learning from surveys:  some ideas from the Metropolitan Police \nTranslating survey findings about public confidence into practical concepts for action is challenging. There has \nbeen a significant push from central government for improvement in public confidence in policing using survey \nfindings over the past five or so years.4  While the police service across the UK has responded with the inevitable \ncreation of various units, directorates and streams of work for citizen focussed policing, at the highest level it is \nthe consistency of the conversation and the message about putting people at the heart of policing that has created \na fulcrum for a shift in behaviour.  Public surveys \u2013 of victim satisfaction, of public confidence \u2013 have put \npeople\u2019s concerns at the heart of how policing itself is judged in England and Wales. \n 5\n \nThe most important tool police have for influencing public views is how, in a broad sense, officers communicate \nwith people. This idea is central to the procedural justice model and other ways of understanding what occurs \nduring face to face and other encounters between public and police. By their actions and demeanour officers \ncommunicate not only that they are acting fairly and properly but that those who they are dealing with are worthy \nof respect, consideration and police attention in a positive sense. However it is important in policy terms to move \nbeyond simply talking about dignity and respect to look at more concrete actions officers can undertake. \nAccordingly we concentrate in this final section on a material way in which police might improve their contacts \n(of whatever kind) with the public \u2013 the communication of information. \n \nTake for example the way people feel about being stopped by the police.  Another glance at Figure 3 above tells \nus that public dissatisfaction with contact arising from police stops is lower than dissatisfaction with public-\ninitiated contacts.  Could it be that a concerted effort in righting the manner in which people experience stop and \nsearch has resulted in police becoming better at explaining why a person has been stopped?  The bureaucracy of \n\u2018stop and search\u2019\/\u2019stop and account\u2019 is heavily criticized by the Flanagan Review (2008). The outcome of stop \nand search\/account is measured in broad terms by the BCS, but the Review did not address a possible positive \noutcome of public\/police contact around stop and search.  As the Review notes, it takes on average 7 minutes per \nindividual encounter to explain to the person stopped the reason why, and to complete the Stop and Account form \nwhich records such encounters for the purposes of public accountability. These forms record who is stopped, not \nhow the public feels about being stopped.  Flanagan states the process of accounting for such encounters \noverlooks the very issue of what is important to the public for how they are treated.  As he says:   \n \nMost important in the one to one interactions between the police and members of the public \u2013 [is] courtesy, respect \nand accountability. (Flanagan 2008:63) \n \nBut the BCS indicates that people are more satisfied with police initiated stops than they are with contacts they \ninitiate themselves; these are usually, of course, calls for help and assistance.  Perhaps the effort police now take \nto explain to people why they have been stopped is one element in this.  We suggest the proactive provision of \ninformation about why people are being stopped makes a difference to the way they feel about how they are \ntreated.  Such care and attention to stop and search demonstrates to people that the police are not taking stops for \ngranted.  Officers are acting properly and in accordance with procedure, the very behaviour the procedural justice \nmodel suggests will be important in informing people\u2019s overall assessments of police\/public encounters.   \n \nHow then can we use the insight from surveys of the public to improve public confidence, particularly around \npublic-initiated requests for help and assistance?  Recent analysis of the MPS Public Attitude Survey shows that \n\u2018being taken seriously\u2019 is by far the most important factor for people\u2019s assessments of their encounters with the \npolice. Bradford et al. (in press) also suggest that the different aspects of self-initiated contact (for example, the \nease at which people could contact police, whether the matter was dealt with straight away or in a way that was \nconvenient, whether officers took the matter seriously and followed it up) are additive.  Those who experience a \nseamless \u2018good service\u2019 are more likely to say the police do an excellent job.  So alongside the work to encourage \npolice to adopt the basics of good customer care, there should be an end-to-end review of the practicalities for \npolice officers to deliver a promise of a seamless process for public-initiated contacts.    \n \nThe MPS Strategic Research Unit has developed a way of understanding the views of Londoners to help police \nmanagers understand the link between people\u2019s attitudes toward and use of the police (for help, assistance or \nengagement) (Mirrless-Black 2006).  The following issues were found to be important in affecting the way \npeople feel about policing in London: worry about crime and disorder; perceptions both of police community \nrelations and of police behaviour; overall level of confidence; ratings of the importance of police activities (such \nas street patrols) and how well people feel police perform these activities; and how well informed people feel \nabout local policing activity. Based on ideas about these issues four distinct groups of Londoners  were \nidentified:   \n \n\u2022 The supporters (making up just under a half of all respondents \u2013 49%) are the most satisfied and \nconfident about police and feel positive about improvement in policing.  These respondents believe \npolice will be fair and respectful, but have little direct experience to draw on.  Within this cluster, few \nrespondents have experiences as victims and few have had direct contact with police. \n 6\n\u2022 The contents (making up another 13% of the respondents) are in the main satisfied with policing, but less \neffusive.  They have low levels of victimisation and police contact, and tend not to express strong \nopinions on any matter. \n\u2022 The needy (making up 16% of the respondents) expect policing to get worse and only a quarter say they \nare satisfied with policing.  These respondents are much more vulnerable than other respondents, with \nhigh levels of victimisation, high levels of police contact, gangs and guns are more often mentioned as \nlocal problems, and have high levels of worry about crime and anti-social behaviour. \n\u2022 The demanding (making up 22% of the respondents) are less likely to have been a victim of crime or to \nexpress worry about crime and anti-social behaviour than the Needy but have similar levels of police \ncontact.  Less than half of this cluster are satisfied with policing, but are more likely to feel informed \nabout and know about neighbourhood policing. \n \nSuch analysis, combined with the lessons from those gleaned from the BCS and other analyses of contact and \ncontact, enables the MPS to ground its discussion of improving the experiences of Londoners in empirical \nanalysis.  Police managers can draw on a menu of approaches to shoring up confidence.  For those who are \ngenerally supportive of the police but have little need of them, good information about local policing problem \nsolving should be sufficient to keep people \u2018in the know\u2019 and confident that police are doing what matters in the \nlocal area.  As analysis of the MPS Public Attitude Survey continues to show, those who feel more informed \nabout local police are more confident.5 Identification of distinct groups of people also allows these groups  to be \nlocated geographically and strategies adjusted accordingly:  the \u2018needy\u2019  tend to live in \u2018hard pressed\u2019 ACORN \nareas, for example, while the \u2018demanding\u2019 tend to live in \u2018urban prosperous\u2019 ACORN areas.   \n \nWhile the police service is improving face-to-face contacts, especially in citizen initiated situations, it has the \nopportunity to improve the ways in which it communicates with people. On one level people want direct \ninformation from the police about local issues facing the community \u2013 we know this from the MPS surveys. The \nMPS is in the process of researching in more depth the best formats for local communication and will report on \nthis in due course. On another, we suggest that being informed about the reasons behind police actions during \none to one contacts is of some importance to those involved in them. \n \nWhat is important here is to open up the dialogue on and about confidence in policing by improving channels of \ncommunication between police and public. We have strong evidence that contact matters. General \ncommunication with the public is another form of \u2018contact\u2019, which can contribute to the way people feel about \ntheir local police service. Furthermore, the act of providing information is not an impediment to the conduct of \npersonal encounters between police and public but is integral to them. Communicating information, for example \non why someone has been stopped or how an officer intends to proceed with an investigation, is an opportunity \nfor police to let people know not only that they are following correct procedures and acting fairly and in \naccordance with the law, but also that they are treating those concerned as full citizens worthy of attention and\/or \nrespect. Such communication is one way in which trust and confidence in the police might be bolstered by \npersonal contacts. \n \nEndnotes \n1. Serving the public (being accessible, responsive, and visible) and holding people accountable to law (applying \nthe law fairly whilst treating suspects with dignity) are at times in tension.  Contact between the police and public \ndramatises a tension at the heart of the police function. Operating at the frontline in the administration of justice, \nthe police serve the public but also hold them to account before the law. Members of the public consequently \ncome into contact with the police in two main ways. On the one hand a citizen might report a crime they have \nwitnessed or experienced, or call for assistance in a huge range of circumstances, from unexpected childbirths to \nbeing locked out of one\u2019s car. On the other hand they might be stopped in the street, arrested on suspicion of \ncommitting a crime, or be disturbed in a number of other ways by police actions.  \n2. This maturation involved an understanding that public confidence is dependent on police relationships with all \ncitizens. \n3. The \u2018decline\u2019 in confidence is most commonly measured by the decline in the proportion of people thinking \nthe police do a \u2018very good\u2019 job. If the much weaker \u2018fairly good\u2019 responses are included, as in Figure 1, the fall \nlooks much less severe. See Reiner (2000) and Loader and Mulcahy (2003) for differing perspectives on the \ndecline in trust and confidence in the police. \n4.
