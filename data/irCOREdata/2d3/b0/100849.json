INTRODUCTION\nThe shape of an atomic nucleus is a fundamental property\nreflecting the spatial distribution of the nucleons. Closed-shell\nnuclei are always spherical in their ground state because\nall orientations in space of the nucleon orbitals are equally\nprobable. In nuclei with open shells the occupation of certain\nshape-driving orbitals tends to polarize the nucleus. To first\norder, when describing the nuclear potential by a simple\nharmonic oscillator, the binding energy is independent of the\nsign of the elongation parameter, and compressed ellipsoidal\n(oblate) and elongated (prolate) shapes should be equally\n*Present address: ISOLDE, CERN, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.\n\u2020Present address: Gesellschaft fu\u00a8r Schwerionenforschung, D-64291\nDarmstadt, Germany.\n\u2021Present address: DEN\/DTN\/SMTM, CEA Cadarache, F-13108\nSaint-Paul-lez-Durance, France.\n\u00a7Present address: Institut de Physique Nucle\u00b4aire, IN2P3-CNRS,\nF-91406 Orsay Cedex, France.\n\u2016Present address: Department of Physics, University of Guelph,\nGuelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada.\n\u00b6Present address: CEA Saclay, DAPNIA\/SAp, F-91191 Gif-sur-\nYvette, France.\n**Deceased.\n\u2020\u2020Present address: Department of Physics, University of York,\nHeslington, York YO10 5DD, UK.\nprobable [1]. Calculations performed with more realistic\npotentials show that prolate ground states are much more\nabundant. This tendency is also confirmed by experiments\nshowing a strong dominance of prolate ground-state shapes.\nThis observation can be related to the shell structure of nuclei\nand in particular to the strength of the spin-orbit term relative to\nthe radial term of the nuclear potential [2]. Both experiments\nand theory show that the prolate dominance is particularly\nevident in heavy nuclei (Z,N > 50), where the shell structure\nhas changed from a harmonic oscillator type to a Mayer-Jensen\ntype with a high-j intruder orbital in each major shell. In lighter\nnuclei (Z,N < 40) prolate and oblate solutions appear more\nevenly in the ground states.\nMany neutron-deficient nuclei in the mass A = 70\u201380\nregion, especially close to the N = Z line, have a large\nquadrupole deformation in their ground state. In addition,\noblate and prolate shapes are predicted to coexist within a\nvery small energy range of a few hundred keV. This shape\ncoexistence is due to the competition of large shell gaps in the\nparticle level scheme for both oblate and prolate deformation at\nproton\/neutron numbers 34, 36, and 38. The neutron-deficient\nSe and Kr isotopes are hence ideal candidates for the study\nof shape polarization and shape-mixing properties. Deformed\nshell-model calculations predict that the N = Z nuclei 68Se\nand 72Kr have oblate ground states with a prolate configuration\ncoexisting at low excitation energy [3]. The situation is\npredicted to be inversed for heavier isotopes, where a prolate\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(5)\/054313(20) 054313-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nE. CL \u00b4EMENT et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 054313 (2007)\nground state is expected to coexist with an excited oblate\nconfiguration.\nA first experimental indication of shape coexistence in\neven-even nuclei is the observation of a low-lying 0+2 state,\nwhich can be interpreted as the ground state of a different\nshape. If both 0+ states are (intrinsically) deformed, one would\nexpect two rotational bands related to the different shapes. If\nthe configurations come close in energy, the wave functions\nof states of the same spin and parity can mix and cause a\ndistortion of the rotational bands. Shape coexistence in light\nkrypton isotopes was first suggested by Piercey et al. [4] to\nexplain the irregularities in the ground-state bands at low spin.\nA metastable low-lying 0+2 state, i.e., a shape isomer, was first\nreported for 74Kr [5,6]. More recently, an isomeric 0+2 state was\nobserved in 72Kr [7], extending the systematics to the N = Z\nline. The excitation energy of the 0+2 states is decreasing\nfrom 78Kr to 74Kr and then increasing again for 72Kr. The\nmeasured strength of the electric monopole transitions \u03c12(E0),\nhowever, is maximal for 74Kr. The mixing amplitudes of the\nwave functions were derived from the distortion at low spin\nof the otherwise regular rotational bands, and were also found\nmaximal for 74Kr [7]. These observations were interpreted as\nevidence for an inversion of the ground-state deformation with\ndecreasing neutron number: 78Kr and 76Kr are assumed to be\nprolate in their ground state, while an oblate shape becomes the\nground state of 72Kr. For 74Kr the intrinsic states of opposite\ndeformation are assumed to be almost degenerate, and the\nmeasured displacement of the two physical 0+ states is mostly\ndue to the repulsion of the strongly mixed states [7]. This\nshape coexistence scenario is conclusive, but it is only based\non indirect measures of the nuclear shapes. Neither the sign\nof the deformation nor the mixing of the low-spins states have\nbeen determined experimentally.\nLow-energy Coulomb excitation is a well-established\nmethod to study collective excitations in nuclei [8]. When two\nnuclei are passing each other on close trajectories, but without\ncoming into the range of the nuclear interaction, collective\nstates can be excited in a purely electromagnetic process.\nSince the interaction time is relatively long, several successive\nexcitations are possible, populating states up to relatively high\nspins. From the measured (differential) Coulomb excitation\ncross section the corresponding electromagnetic matrix el-\nements can be extracted. Diagonal matrix elements can be\ndetermined and the (intrinsic) shape parameters extracted\nvia second-order interference terms in the excitation process.\nSensitivity to the diagonal matrix elements comes for example\nfrom the reorientation effect, which is caused by second-order\ntransitions between the magnetic substates of an excited state\n[9]. Coulomb excitation is thus the only method that can\ndirectly distinguish between different shapes of the nucleus\nand is ideally suited to verify the shape coexistence scenario\nin the light Se and Kr isotopes.\nUntil very recently Coulomb excitation experiments at low\nenergy were limited to stable or very long-lived nuclei, both for\nprojectile or target excitation. With the availability of radioac-\ntive ion beams (RIBs) from ISOL facilities, such experiments\nare now starting to become possible for projectile excitation of\nshort-lived unstable nuclei. In-flight facilities cannot deliver\npure low-energy radioactive beams with acceptable emittance\nand are therefore only suitable for intermediate-energy but not\nfor low-energy Coulomb excitation experiments. For a precise\ndetermination of diagonal matrix elements it is necessary to\nmeasure the differential Coulomb excitation cross section (or\nthe excitation probability) very accurately at safe energies well\nbelow the Coulomb barrier over a large range of scattering an-\ngles. A variation of the atomic number Z of the target nucleus\nincreases the sensitivity of the measurement. The SPIRAL fa-\ncility [10] at GANIL (Caen, France) delivers high-quality RIBs\nand especially rare gases are produced with relatively high\nintensities. Two projectile Coulomb excitation experiments\nwere performed with beams of 74Kr and 76Kr, respectively. The\nhigh precision of the data allowed exploiting the reorientation\neffect for the first time with radioactive beams.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe radioactive 74Kr and 76Kr beams were produced at\nthe SPIRAL facility [10] at GANIL by fragmentation of an\nintense primary beam of stable 78Kr of 1012 particles per\nsecond at 68.5A MeV on a thick carbon production target. The\nradioactive species were extracted, ionized in an ECR source,\nand post-accelerated in the K = 265 CIME cyclotron to 4.4 A\nMeV for 76Kr and 4.7 A MeV for 74Kr. The average secondary\nbeam intensity was 5 \u00d7 105 and 104 pps for 76Kr and 74Kr,\nrespectively. Due to the excellent mass separation of the CIME\ncyclotron isobaric contaminants are strongly suppressed; only\nin the case of 74Kr a small 74Se contamination of \u223c1% was\nobserved. The 76Kr and 74Kr projectiles were Coulomb excited\non 208Pb targets of 0.9 and 1.0 mg\/cm2 thickness, respectively.\nThe production scheme of the radioactive beams and the\nexperimental set-up are shown schematically in Fig. 1.\nBoth experiments used the same experimental set-up. The\nscattered projectiles and the recoiling target nuclei were\ndetected in an annular, highly segmented double-sided silicon\nstrip detector (DSSD) of 300 \u00b5m thickness.

The\nactive area with inner and outer radii of 11 and 35 mm,\nrespectively, was segmented into 16 concentric rings and\n16 azimuthal sectors. The energy resolution of the silicon\ndetector was sufficient to distinguish between the scattered\nKr projectiles and the recoiling Pb nuclei. This allowed a full\nkinematical reconstruction of the Coulomb excitation events\nwhen either the Kr or the Pb nucleus was detected. The\nDSSD covered scattering angles between 23.8\u25e6 and 54.5\u25e6 in\nthe laboratory frame corresponding to a continuous range of\nscattering angles between 24\u25e6 and 145\u25e6 in the center-of-mass\nframe. For the scattering angles covered by the DSSD the\ndistance of closest approach d between projectile and target\nnuclei always corresponded to \u201csafe\u201d values to ensure a purely\nelectromagnetic excitation, fulfilling the condition [11]\nd > 1.25\n(\nA\n1\/3\nP + A1\/3T\n)+ 5 fm. (1)\nThe segmentation of the silicon detector allowed measuring\nthe differential Coulomb excitation cross section as a function\nof scattering angle. Unscattered projectiles left the target\narea through the central hole in the detector, reducing the\nradioactive background from the beam.\nThe \u03b3 rays depopulating the Coulomb-excited states were\ndetected in the EXOGAM array [12] of large segmented\ngermanium clover detectors with escape suppression shields.\nEach clover detector comprises four individual germanium\ncrystals, and each crystal is electrically segmented into four\nlongitudinal segments. The array comprised six full-size and\none smaller clover detector for the 76Kr experiment, and seven\nlarge and four smaller detectors for the 74Kr experiment. The\ndetectors were placed at 90\u25e6 and 135\u25e6 with respect to the\nbeam axis, and the distance between the front face of the\ndetectors and the target was 11.2 cm for the large and 14 cm\nfor the smaller detectors. The efficiency for full-energy\nabsorption of a 1.3 MeV \u03b3 ray was measured to be 12%\nduring the 74Kr experiment. Events were recorded when at\nleast one \u03b3 ray was detected in coincidence with one of the\ncollision partners. The coincidence requirement suppressed\nthe very large background from the radioactive beam almost\ncompletely. The segmentation of both the germanium and the\nsilicon detectors allowed a precise determination of the relative\nangle between scattered Kr projectiles and the emitted \u03b3 rays.\nAfter Doppler correction a resolution of 8 keV was obtained\nfor a \u03b3 ray of 500 keV.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nA. 76Kr Experiment\nThe total Doppler corrected \u03b3 -ray spectrum in coincidence\nwith either the scattered 76Kr projectiles or the recoiling 208Pb\ntarget nuclei is shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum is very clean\nand neither background from the radioactive decay of the beam\nnor from isobaric contaminants of the beam are present. Data\nwere collected for \u223c50 h with a secondary beam intensity of\n5 \u00d7 105 pps.

All states and transitions of the level scheme in Fig. 3\nhad been observed previously [13].\nThe 0+2 state at 770 keV, which is a candidate for having a\nshape different from that of the ground state, is populated and\nits decay to the 2+1 state observed. The 2\n+\n3 state at 1687 keV is\nfeeding the 0+2 state. However, this transition of 918 keV is not\nfully resolved from the 4+2 \u2192 4+1 transition with 923 keV. The\n\u0003J = 2 sequence above the 2+2 state at 1222 keV has been\ninterpreted [14] as a K = 2 quasi-gamma band together with a\n\u0003J = 2 sequence on top of a 3+ state at 1733 keV, which was\nnot populated in the present Coulomb excitation experiment.\nThe 2+2 state of this band, however, was populated and possibly\nalso the 4+2 state, so that all even-spin members of the band\nhave been included in the Coulomb excitation analysis.\nTo extract matrix elements from the differential Coulomb\nexcitation cross sections and the observed \u03b3 -ray yields, the\ndata was divided into several subsets corresponding to different\nranges of scattering angles.

However, the ranges where\nthe higher-lying states are populated with the highest cross\nsections are covered by the detector. Moreover, the sensitivity\nto higher-order effects, which allow determining the diagonal\nmatrix elements, comes mostly from the large scattering\nangles. The division of the total data into the four ranges\nshown in Fig. 4 was found to be a good compromise between\nthe largest possible number of data subsets for different angular\nranges and the minimum level of statistics required to extract\nthe \u03b3 -ray yields from the individual spectra.\nThe \u03b3 -ray spectra for the four data sets are shown in\nFig. 5 and the \u03b3 -ray yields extracted from these spectra\nare summarized in Table I. As the center-of-mass scattering\nangle is increasing for the data sets from A to D, the impact\nparameter and the distance of closest approach are decreasing.\nAs a consequence, the probability to populate states at higher\nexcitation energy and higher angular momentum via multi-step\nexcitation is strongly enhanced for large scattering angles. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 6, where the \u03b3 -ray yields are plotted\nas functions of the scattering angle for several transitions\nnormalized to the 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition. The \u03b3 -ray yields\nshow not only a strong dependence on the scattering angle,\nbut this dependence also differs significantly for the different\ntransitions, which illustrates the sensitivity of the data to the\nmatrix elements.\n0 400 800 1200\nE\u03b3  (keV)\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nco\nu\nn\nts\n \/ \nke\nV\nA\n4 1+\n\u2192\n \n2 1+21\n+\n\u2192 01\n+\n6 1+\n\u2192\n \n4 1+\n2 2+\n\u2192\n \n2 1+\n0 2+\n\u2192\n \n2 1+\n2 2+\n\u2192\n \n0 1+\n8 1+\n\u2192\n \n6 1+\n4 2+\n\u2192\n \n2 2+ 2 3+\n\u2192\n \n0 2+\n4 2+\n\u2192\n \n4 1+\n400 800 1200\nE\u03b3  (keV)\nB\n400 800 1200\nE\u03b3  (keV)\nC\n400 800 1200\nE\u03b3  (keV)\nD\nFIG. 5.

An average secondary beam\nintensity of 104 pps was achieved during the experiment. The\nlower beam intensity compared to the 76Kr experiment was\npartly compensated by a longer running time of \u223c150 h.\nFurthermore, the experimental difficulties concerning the\nsilicon detector could be resolved and a larger range of\nscattering angles was covered. The number of germanium\nclover detectors in the EXOGAM array was also increased,\nresulting in a higher full-energy detection efficiency of 12% at\na \u03b3 -ray energy of 1.3 MeV. Even though the secondary beam\nintensity for 74Kr was 50 times smaller compared to the 76Kr\nexperiment, the level of statistics was only reduced by a factor\nof five. The total \u03b3 -ray spectrum in coincidence with either\nscattered 74Kr projectiles or recoiling target nuclei is shown in\nFig. 7.

Its strength accounts for\n1.2% of the total beam intensity. No other contaminants of the\nbeam were observed.\nA partial level scheme of 74Kr with the observed transitions\nis presented in Fig. 3. As was the case for 76Kr, the ground-state\nband of 74Kr was populated up to the 8+ state. The metastable\n0+2 state at 508 keV was interpreted as a shape isomer\ncorresponding to a shape different from that of the ground\nstate [7]. This state is populated via the 694 keV transition from\nthe 2+2 state. Its decay proceeds via an enhanced E0 transition\nto the ground state and a strongly converted E2 transition of\n52 keV to the 2+1 state [5\u20137] and is therefore not observed in\nthis experiment. The 2+2 state also decays to the 2\n+\n1 and directly\nto the ground state. The branching ratio for the decay of the 2+2\nstate is known from an earlier measurement [15]. A 4+2 state\nis expected above the 2+2 state as part of a rotational structure,\nbut has not been reported previously. A new transition is\nobserved at 910 keV in the spectrum of Fig. 7, which does\nnot correspond to any known transition in 74Kr or neighboring\nnuclei that could potentially contaminate the beam. Because\nthe energy and, as will be shown, the matrix element of\nthis transition agree with the expected rotational state, a 4+2\nstate is tentatively placed at 2112 keV. Weak \u03b3 \u03b3 coincidence\ndata were obtained confirming the above assignment, but an\nalternative interpretation of the 910 keV peak as a 4+2 \u2192 4+1\ntransition cannot be completely excluded. In this case the 4+2\nstate would be located 188 keV lower.\nA third 0+ state at 1654 keV and a third 2+ state at 1741 keV\nexcitation energy have been observed after \u03b2 decay [15]. The\n0+3 \u2192 2+1 transition of 1198 keV is not resolved from the\n2+2 \u2192 0+1 transition of 1202 keV. The larger width of the\npeak at 1200 keV, however, shows that the 0+3 state was also\npopulated. The 2+3 \u2192 0+2 transition of 1233 keV is visible as a\nshoulder of this peak, and a very weak transition at 1285 keV\nis interpreted as the 2+3 \u2192 2+1 transition.\nThe full data set for 74Kr was divided into four ranges of\nscattering angles as shown in Table II. The first two ranges,\nA and B, correspond to the detection of the 74Kr projectile\nin the silicon detector, whereas the last two ranges, C and D,\ncorrespond to the detection of the recoiling 208Pb nuclei from\nthe target. The individual spectra from the four subsets of\ndata are shown in Fig. 8. This division is again a compromise\nbetween the maximum number of data sets and the minimum\nlevel of statistics required to extract the \u03b3 -ray yields. A\ndivision into only two ranges of scattering angles improves\nthe uncertainty of the \u03b3 -ray yields, but was found to result in\nan insufficient number of data points to determine the large\nnumber of matrix elements needed to describe the data. The\nyields extracted from the spectra of Fig. 8 are summarized in\nTable II.\nDuring the data analysis it was found that the silicon\ndetector was not fully aligned with the beam axis in the\nexperiment. The count rates are not isotropically distributed\nover the azimuthal sectors of the detector. By measuring\nthe Rutherford scattering cross section individually for the\nazimuthal sectors and comparing to a Monte Carlo simulation,\nthe displacement of the detector with respect to the beam\naxis was found to be 3.0(5) mm. This misalignment breaks the\ncylindrical symmetry of the set-up and introduces an azimuthal\n054313-5\nE. CL \u00b4EMENT et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 054313 (2007)\nTABLE II.

The Doppler correction improves\nsignificantly when taking the displacement into account, and\nthe same resolution as for the 76Kr experiment is achieved. This\nis shown in Fig. 9, where the different steps of the Doppler\ncorrection process are illustrated.\nIV. COULOMB EXCITATION ANALYSIS\nA. GOSIA analysis\nThe Coulomb excitation analysis was performed using\nthe least squares fitting code GOSIA [8,16]. A standard \u03c72\nfunction is constructed from the measured \u03b3 -ray yields and\nthose calculated from a complete set of electromagnetic matrix\nelements, both transitional and diagonal, between all known\nstates involved in the excitation process (see Fig. 3). As\nlong as the \u201csafe\u201d condition from Eq. (1) is fulfilled, the\nelectromagnetic excitation probability can be calculated with\nvery high precision in a semiclassical way [9]. The 208Pb target\nis assumed to be inert and its electromagnetic excitation can be\nneglected due to the high excitation energy of the first excited\nstate (I\u03c0 = 3\u2212 at 2.6 MeV).\nTo exploit the dependence of the excitation probability on\nthe scattering angle, the data is divided into several subsets\ncorresponding to different ranges of scattering angles, as\ndescribed in the previous section. An alternative (or additional)\nmethod would be to use different target materials and exploit\nthe Z dependence of the Coulomb excitation cross section.\nDue to the weak intensities of the radioactive beams, the\nlevel of statistics of the \u03b3 -ray spectra is limited, and the\nbins of scattering angles are relatively wide. As the number\nof matrix elements, i.e., the number of degrees of freedom\nin the fitting process, is similar to the number of data\npoints (\u03b3 -ray yields), the fitting problem is underdetermined.\nHowever, the convergence of the fit can be improved by using\nexperimentally known spectroscopic data such as lifetimes,\nbranching and mixing ratios as additional data points in the fit.\nThe experimental uncertainties of the respective spectroscopic\ninformation enter into the \u03c72 fit of the matrix elements. In\nexperiments with stable beams, which do not suffer from low\nstatistics, these quantities can be treated as free parameters, and\nall the spectroscopic information can in principle be extracted\ndirectly from the Coulomb excitation data.\nTo calculate the \u03b3 -ray yields from the matrix elements,\nthe position and geometry of all detectors and their relative\nefficiency have to be taken into account. In view of the\nclose geometry it is also important to correct for the small\ndisplacement of the silicon detector with respect to the beam\naxis in the 74Kr experiment. The exact reproduction of the\nexperimental yields requires the integration over the range of\nscattering angles as defined in Tables I and II, and over the\nrange of bombarding energies resulting from the energy loss\nof the projectiles in the lead target. The \u03b3 -ray intensities are\ncorrected for internal conversion. The angular distribution of\nthe \u03b3 rays is taken into account; it is corrected for relativistic\neffects and the attenuation caused by the nuclear deorientation\neffect during recoil into vacuum.\nIt is of great advantage that the level schemes of both\n74Kr and 76Kr were known and that all known transitions\ncould be identified. Therefore most of the matrix elements\n054313-6\nSHAPE COEXISTENCE IN NEUTRON-DEFICIENT . . .

All spectra are shown without any background subtraction.\ndata. The transitional matrix elements are related to the reduced\nE2 transition probabilities as:\nB(E2; I1 \u2192 I2) = |\u3008I2\u2016M(E2)\u2016I1\u3009|\n2\n2I1 + 1 .\nThe transitional quadrupole moment in the intrinsic reference\nframe can be expressed in the rotational model as:\neQt0 =\n\u221a\n16\u03c0\n5\n1\u221a\n2I1 + 1\n\u3008I2\u2016M(E2)\u2016I1\u3009\n\u3008I1K120|I2K2\u3009 .\nNote that one has to make assumptions about the K quantum\nnumbers of the initial and final states to express the matrix ele-\nment as a transitional quadrupole moment, whereas the B(E2)\nvalue is model independent. The signs of the transitional matrix\nelements are relative and give no additional information about\nthe shape.\nThe diagonal matrix element is a direct measure of the\nspectroscopic quadrupole moment Qs(I ) of the state in the\nlaboratory frame and, using the sign convention of Alder and\nWinther [9], can be written as:\neQs =\n\u221a\n16\u03c0\n5\n\u3008II20|II \u3009\u221a\n2I + 1 \u3008I\u2016M(E2)\u2016I \u3009.\nThe diagonal matrix elements are related to the static\nquadrupole moments of the nuclear state in the intrinsic frame\nand therefore to the charge distribution of the nucleus in that\nstate:\neQs0 =\n\u221a\n16\u03c0\n5\n1\u221a\n2I + 1\n\u3008I\u2016M(E2)\u2016I \u3009\n\u3008IK20|IK\u3009 .\nIn order to extract the static quadrupole moment from the\ndiagonal matrix element an assumption on the K value of the\nstate is again needed. The sign of the diagonal matrix element\nis related to the type of quadrupole deformation: for K = 0 a\nnegative value corresponds to a prolate and a positive value to\nan oblate deformation in the intrinsic frame of the nucleus.\nB.

The signs of the transitional matrix elements\nare relative. Multiple combinations of signs can result in\nexactly the same population of the states. Positive signs were\nchosen for the transitional matrix elements in the ground-state\nband and other in-band transitions. The signs of all other\ntransitional matrix elements are determined relative to these.\nThe signs of the diagonal matrix elements are observables and\ncannot be chosen. Changing the sign of any of the diagonal\nmatrix elements shown in Table VI results in a higher \u03c72 value\nof the fit. In addition, the relative phases of the transitional\nmatrix elements between the different 0+ and 2+ states were\ninvestigated. Changing the sign of a closed loop of three matrix\nelements\nP3\n(\nI\u03c01 , I\n\u03c0\n2 , I\n\u03c0\n3\n)\n= \u2329I\u03c01 \u2223\u2223|M(E2)|\u2223\u2223I\u03c02 \u232a \u2329I\u03c02 \u2223\u2223|M(E2)|\u2223\u2223I\u03c03 \u232a \u2329I\u03c03 \u2223\u2223|M(E2)|\u2223\u2223I\u03c01 \u232a\nalways resulted in a higher \u03c72 value, showing the sensitivity\nto the signs of the transitional matrix elements. However, the\nsigns of the diagonal matrix elements remained the same when\nthe sign of P3 was inverted, showing the robustness of the\nfit for the diagonal matrix elements. As an example, the \u03c72\nincreases from 1.7 to 13 (after minimization) when changing\nthe phase P3(0+2 , 2+1 , 2+2 ) from positive to negative. In that case\nthe diagonal matrix elements for the 2+1 and 2\n+\n2 states change\nfrom \u22120.9 to \u22120.6 eb and from \u22121.0 to \u22120.5 eb, respectively.\nTo further illustrate the sensitivity of the fit to the diagonal\nmatrix elements, the \u03c72 variation is shown as a function of\nthe diagonal matrix elements for the 2+1 , 4\n+\n1 and 2\n+\n3 states\nin Fig. 10.

The \u03c72 curves resulting from the variation\nof the diagonal matrix elements for the 2+1 and 4\n+\n1 states are\nvery narrow, showing that the fit is very sensitive to these\nmatrix elements, which have consequently a relatively small\nuncertainty. The curve for the 2+3 state is much wider, so\nthat this matrix element is less well defined and the error is\nlarger. It should be noted, however, that this one-dimensional\nvariation of the matrix elements serves only the purpose of\nillustrating the sensitivity of the fit. To find the values and\nerrors of the matrix elements, all matrix elements are varied\nin a multidimensional fit including a full error analysis of the\ncorrelated parameters [22].\nBoth the angular distribution of the \u03b3 rays and the\ndeorientation of the nuclear alignment have to be taken into\naccount in the \u03c72 minimization of the \u03b3 -ray yields. The\ndeorientation is due to the interaction between the recoiling\nnucleus and fluctuating hyperfine fields created by atomic\nelectrons. The effect attenuates the angular distribution of\nthe \u03b3 rays. The complex deorientation effect is treated in a\nsimplifying phenomenological two-state deorientation model\n[23,24]. The most important parameters in this model are the\nspin and lifetime of the state, as well as its gyromagnetic\nfactor. While the lifetimes of the states are either taken from\na complementary measurement or come directly out of the\nGOSIA fit, the g factors are mostly unknown. In these cases\nthe g-factor values from the general approximation g = Z\/A\ncan be used, even though there can be significant deviations\nfrom that value depending on the structure of the state. The\ng factor of the 2+1 state in 76Kr was recently measured to be\ng = +0.37(11) [25]. The influence of the g factor and the\ndeorientation effect on the matrix elements was investigated\nTABLE VI.

No difference was found for the\ntransitional matrix elements when including the deorientation\neffect or not, and when using Z\/A or the measured value.\nThe diagonal matrix element of the 2+1 state differed by 8%\nwhen the deorientation was not included in the calculation. The\ndifference between using g = 0.37 and g = 0.47, however,\nwas negligible. Consequently, the approximation g = Z\/A\nwas used to model the deorientation effect for the higher-lying\nstates in 76Kr and for all states in 74Kr.\nThe fact that the 2+3 \u2192 0+2 transition with 918 keV cannot\nbe fully resolved from the 4+2 \u2192 4+1 transition with 923 keV\nrequires particular attention for the evaluation of the respective\nmatrix elements. It is possible to include such doublets in\nthe GOSIA analysis by only fixing the sum of both \u03b3 -ray\nintensities rather than using the individual ones. This results\nnecessarily in less accurate values for the matrix elements.\nThe transitional matrix elements that are found without any\nfurther assumptions about the doublet show that the transition\nstrength for the 2+3 \u2192 0+2 transition is much higher than for\nthe 4+2 \u2192 4+1 transition. In addition to that, the population of\nthe 4+2 state is expected to be much weaker than for the 2\n+\n3\nstate, because it requires at least a two-step excitation, while\nthe rather collective 2+3 state at a similar excitation energy can\nbe reached in one step. If the 4+2 state were populated, not\nonly its decay to the 4+1 state, but also the 736 keV transition\nto the 2+2 state should be observed. This branching ratio was\nreported to be 0.56 [13] and 0.82 [19].

Normalized \u03c7 2 curves as a function of the diagonal\nmatrix elements of the 2+1 , 4\n+\n1 , and 2+3 states in 76Kr. Only the one\nmatrix element in question was varied in the calculation of the \u03b3 -ray\nyields to illustrate the sensitivity of the \u03c7 2 fit to this matrix element.\n(see Figs. 2 and 5) it can be assumed that the 4+2 state is only\nweakly populated, if at all, and that the contribution of the\n4+2 \u2192 4+1 transition to the peak observed at 920 keV can be\nneglected. This assumption improves the accuracy for both the\ntransitional matrix elements of the respective transitions and\nfor the diagonal matrix element of the 2+3 state. Following this\nargumentation, no decay from the 4+2 state is observed, and\nconsequently the diagonal matrix element for this state cannot\nbe determined.\nThe matrix elements of Table V are grouped into in-band\ntransitions in the upper part of the table and interband\ntransitions in the lower part. The in-band transitions comprise\nall transitions of the ground-state band and the 2+3 \u2192 0+2 and\n4+2 \u2192 2+2 transitions (see Fig. 3). All in-band transitions have\nlarge matrix elements, i.e., they are collective, as expected for\nwell-deformed rotational bands. The deduced B(E2) values\nare fully compatible with those extracted from the measured\nlifetimes [19,20]. The drop of the transitional quadrupole\nmoments Qt0 in the lower part of the ground-state band has\nbeen interpreted as a sign for mixing of prolate and oblate\nconfigurations in the low-spin states [20]. This interpretation\nis further supported by the large matrix elements for some\nof the interband transitions. The fact that the 0+2 state is\nstrongly linked to all three observed 2+ states, however,\nindicates that a grouping of the states into rotational bands\nis not straightforward and that the situation might be more\ncomplex than the description with two rotational bands built\non strongly deformed prolate and oblate states together with\na quasi-gamma band. The transitional matrix elements allow\nto determine previously unknown lifetimes, for example, for\nthe 2+3 state, or to improve the precision of previously known\nlifetimes, as is summarized in Table IV.\nThe diagonal matrix elements for the three lowest states\nof the ground-state band and for the two excited 2+ states\nare given in Table VI together with the deduced static and\nspectroscopic quadrupole moments. The negative sign of the\ndiagonal matrix elements for the states in the ground-state\nband proves their prolate shape. The absolute size of the\nquadrupole moments decreases toward the bottom of the band.\nThis shows that the deformation for the 2+1 state is indeed\nsmaller than for the states above. In addition, the values of the\nstatic and transitional quadrupole moments for this state are\nrather similar, as expected for a rotational nucleus. Very large\nstatic quadrupole moments are found for the higher-spin states\nin the ground-state band, which differ from the transitional\nquadrupole moments. This might be due to a possible coupling\nto other unknown states, which could not be taken into account\nin the analysis.\nThe diagonal matrix element of the 2+3 state has a relatively\nlarge uncertainty, mainly because no transition above this\nstate was observed. Nevertheless there is no doubt about the\npositive sign of the matrix element, which is consistent with the\nassumption of an oblate-deformed K = 0 band. The large E2\nmatrix element to the 0+2 state further supports the assumption\nof a rotational character of the state, so that the association of\nthe 2+3 state with an oblate shape seems well justified.\nThe negative sign of the matrix element for the 2+2 state\nis more difficult to understand.

Indeed, the coupling of the 2+2 state to\nthe 0+2 state is much stronger than that to the ground state. If one\nassumes K = 0 for the 2+2 state, the quadrupole moment Qs0\nbecomes positive, indicating a prolate shape, in which case the\ninterpretation of a quasi-gamma band is also excluded, besides\nthe fact that there should be a third 0+ state for which there is no\nevidence. As was argued before, the strong coupling between\nall three bands and in particular between the 0+2 state and all\nthree 2+ states blurs a clear separation and grouping into band\nstructures, as will be discussed in more detail in section V.\nC. Matrix elements for 74Kr\nThe \u03c72 minimization of the \u03b3 -ray yields for 74Kr was\nperformed with 31 E2 and 5 M1 matrix elements connecting\nthe known states as shown in Fig. 3. As in the case of 76Kr,\nexperimentally known branching ratios and lifetimes were\nused as additional input data in the fitting procedure. The\nbranching ratios that were recently measured after \u03b2 decay\nof 74Rb [15] are summarized in Table VIII. The decay of the\n0+2 state represents a special case because the E0 branch to\nthe ground state proceeds exclusively via conversion electrons\nand the E2 branch to the 2+1 state has very low energy\nand is consequently also highly converted. Even though the\nCoulomb excitation experiment was not sensitive to conversion\nelectrons, the decay of this state with its branching ratio and\npartial lifetimes [7] can nevertheless be used to constrain the\nfit. No mixing ratios are known in 74Kr.\nLifetimes in 74Kr have been measured for the 2+1 and 4\n+\n1\nstates using the recoil-distance method [26,27], and using the\nDoppler-shift attenuation method for the higher-lying states of\nthe ground-state band [26,28,29]. The lifetime of the isomeric\n0+2 state was established in a conversion-electron measurement\n[7]. The lifetime values are summarized in Table IX.\nBefore using the literature values for the lifetimes as\ncomplementary input in the fitting procedure, their consistency\nwith the Coulomb excitation data was examined. The results,\nalso given in Table IX, show a strong deviation from the values\nreported in Ref. [26,27]. Especially the lifetime of the 4+1 state\nis found to be significantly shorter than previously reported.\nTABLE IX. Lifetimes of states in 74Kr.

The range of scattering angles\nfor this comparison was limited to small values \u03b8cm < 70\u25e6,\nwhere higher-order effects and in particular the influence of the\ndiagonal matrix elements are expected to be small, so that this\ncomparison of \u03b3 -ray yields represents a relatively clean test\nof the B(E2) strengths and of the lifetimes of the respective\nstates. The fact that the \u03b3 -ray yields cannot be reproduced\nsimultaneously for both transitions shows that the Coulomb\nexcitation data are not compatible with the lifetimes reported\nin Ref. [26,27].\nThis inconsistency, which makes the determination of the\ndiagonal matrix elements difficult, prompted a new recoil-\ndistance lifetime experiment with much improved precision\n[20]. The new measurement found slightly longer and shorter\nlifetimes for the 2+1 and 4\n+\n1 states, respectively, than expected\nfrom the Coulomb excitation data, but especially the result for\nthe 4+1 state is deviating significantly from the value reported by\nRoth et al. [27]. Possible reasons for this are discussed in Ref.\n[20]. The new results are compared to the earlier measurements\nand to the results from the Coulomb excitation data in Table IX.\nWhen the lifetimes of the new measurement are used in the\nGOSIA fit, the inconsistencies disappear. The \u03b3 -ray yields\ncalculated from the re-evaluated matrix elements based on the\nnew lifetime results are shown as full lines in Fig. 11. Even\nthough the new lifetimes have small uncertainties and leave\nvery little room for variations of the calculated \u03b3 -ray yields\nin the shown angular range, the agreement is excellent, which\nshows the full consistency between the recoil-distance and the\nCoulomb excitation measurements.\nUsing the new precise lifetimes in the GOSIA analysis\nenhances the sensitivity to the higher-order effects signifi-\ncantly, so that many more transitional matrix elements between\nhigher-lying states and several diagonal matrix elements\ncould be determined. The results for the transitional matrix\nelements are summarized in Table X; those for the diagonal\nmatrix elements and the static quadrupole moments can be\nfound in Table XI. The inconsistency with the previously\nreported lifetimes illustrates a general difficulty that can arise\nin Coulomb excitation experiments with weak radioactive\nbeams of rare isotopes, where the statistics is too lim-\nited to determine all parameters in the Coulomb excitation\nanalysis alone, and where at the same time the access to\nspectroscopic information with complementary methods is\ndifficult.\nTABLE XI.

Normalized \u03c7 2 curves as a function of the diagonal\nmatrix elements of the 2+1 , 4\n+\n1 , and 2+2 states in 74Kr. Only the one\nmatrix element in question was varied in the calculation of the \u03b3 -ray\nyields to illustrate the sensitivity of the \u03c7 2 fit to this matrix element.\nTo illustrate the sensitivity of the Coulomb excitation\nanalysis to the diagonal matrix elements, \u03c72 curves for the\n2+1 , 4\n+\n1 , and 2\n+\n2 states are shown in Fig. 12 as functions of the\ndiagonal matrix elements of the respective states. The curves\nare normalized in exactly the same way as in Fig. 10 to allow\na direct comparison. The \u03c72 minima are wider than in the\n76Kr case, which is mostly due to the lower level of statistics\nin the 74Kr experiment. Again it should be noted that these\ncurves cannot be used for an error analysis, as only one matrix\nelement was varied at a time, whereas the uncertainties given\nin Tables X and XI are based on the simultaneous fit of the\ncorrelated matrix elements.\nThe high level of statistics for the transitions in the\nground-state band allows extracting the \u03b3 -ray intensities for\nsmaller angular bins than the four ranges that were used in\nthe GOSIA analysis (see Table II). The intensities of the\n4+1 \u2192 2+1 and the 6+1 \u2192 4+1 transitions are shown in the\nupper part of Fig. 13 as functions of the scattering angle.\nThe intensities are normalized to the 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition to\nminimize the systematic errors from the efficiencies of the\ngermanium and silicon detectors. The full lines correspond\nto the \u03b3 -ray intensities calculated from the complete set of\nmatrix elements found in the \u03c72 minimization (see Tables X\nand XI). Even though the matrix elements were extracted from\nthe \u03b3 -ray yields of only four angular ranges, the agreement\nwith the more detailed analysis is remarkable and shows the\nconsistency of the analysis. The dashed line results from\ninverting the sign of the diagonal matrix elements for the\nstates of the ground-state band. The inversion of the signs\nleads to a disagreement especially for the large center-of-mass\nscattering angles, i.e. for small impact parameters and a close\napproach of projectile and target, while the small scattering\nangles are mostly sensitive to the first-order excitation process,\ni.e., to the B(E2) values, as was discussed in the context\nof Fig. 11. The difference between the yields calculated for\ndifferent signs of the diagonal matrix elements illustrates\nthe sensitivity of the measurement to the reorientation effect.\nAgain, this cannot be used for a quantitative analysis, because\nonly some selected matrix elements were arbitrarily changed,\nwhile both the transitional and the diagonal matrix elements of\nFIG. 13. (Color online) \u03b3 -ray yields as a function of scattering\nangle for the 4+1 \u2192 2+1 , 6+1 \u2192 4+1 (top) and 2+2 \u2192 2+1 (bottom)\ntransitions in 74Kr normalized to the 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition. The lines\nrepresent the corresponding yields based on the full set of matrix\nelements. The dashed line in the upper graph resulted from an\ninversion of the signs of the diagonal matrix elements for the states\nin the ground-state band.\nthe non-yrast states were kept unchanged. The second graph\nshows the equivalent plot for the 2+2 \u2192 2+1 transition, also\nnormalized to the 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition. Because the yield is\nsmaller for this transition, the intensity has to be divided into\nfewer and wider angular bins. The agreement with the yield\ncalculated from the matrix elements is yet another example for\nthe consistency of the analysis.\nThe transitional matrix elements in Table X are again\ngrouped into the in-band transitions (as illustrated in Fig. 3)\nin the top part of the table and interband transitions in the\nbottom part. Only those matrix elements are shown that could\nbe established with reasonable uncertainties. The transitions\nwithin the ground-state band show a decrease in the lower\npart of the band similar to the 76Kr case. This has also been\ninterpreted as a sign for a mixing of the low-spin states and\nshape coexistence [20]. The transitions of the excited band are\nless collective than the transitions of the ground-state band.\nMany of the interband transitions presented in the lower part\nof Table X are surprisingly strong. In particular the matrix\nelement for the 0+2 \u2192 2+1 transition is almost as large as that\nof the 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition. This supports the interpretation of\na strong mixing between prolate and oblate shapes for the two\n0+ states, which was proposed in Ref. [7] based on the \u03c12(E0)\nstrength and the distortion of the rotational ground-state band.\nLifetimes can be extracted for those states for which the matrix\nelements of the depopulating transitions could be sufficiently\nwell determined, yielding the previously unknown lifetimes\n054313-13\nE.

The results are summarized in\nTable IX.\nThe negative sign of the diagonal matrix elements for the\nstates in the ground-state band proves their prolate character.\nThe quadrupole moments indicate a decrease of deformation\ntoward the ground state. The role of the 2+2 and 2\n+\n3 states is\nnot entirely clear. If one assumes that the 0+2 , 2\n+\n2 , and 4\n+\n2 states\nform a rotational band with K = 0, which seems justified by\nthe large matrix elements connecting the states, the positive\nsign of the \u30082+2 \u2016M(E2)\u20162+2 \u3009 matrix element corresponds to\noblate shape. However, there is also a strong coupling between\nthe 2+3 and 0\n+\n2 states, so that the 2\n+\n3 state, which has also a\npositive diagonal matrix element, is another candidate for an\noblate rotational state built on the 0+2 state. In the latter case\nthe 2+2 and 4\n+\n2 states could be explained as members of a\ngamma-vibrational K = 2 band, whereas in the former case\nthe 2+3 state could be interpreted as a K = 2 state. Similar as\nfor 76Kr, the initial picture of two coexisting rotational bands\nwith prolate and oblate shapes is clearly too simple, as oblate\nand prolate as well as K = 0 and K = 2 components seem to\nbe strongly mixed in the wave functions of the various states.\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe large number of experimental electromagnetic matrix\nelements for the low-spin states in 74Kr and 76Kr allows a\ndetailed discussion of the shape coexistence phenomenon in\nthese nuclei. In particular, negative values were found for the\ndiagonal matrix elements of several states in the ground-state\nband of both isotopes, confirming the prolate shape of these\nstates. Positive matrix elements were found for excited 2+\nstates which are strongly connected to the 0+2 states in both 74Kr\nand 76Kr, consistent with an oblate character of these states.\nThese results confirm the prolate-oblate shape coexistence\nscenario in both isotopes under study. However, a closer\ninspection of the matrix elements of Tables V, VI, X, and\nXI shows that the actual scenario is more complicated. In\nparticular the influence of the third 2+ state observed in both\nisotopes and usually interpreted as member of a quasi-gamma\nband needs further investigation.\nThe strength of the 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition is strongly reduced\ncompared to the other transitions of the ground-state bands in\nboth isotopes in accordance with the assumption of increased\nmixing toward the band heads. The decrease is stronger in 74Kr\nthan in 76Kr, pointing to a stronger mixing in 74Kr. The static\nquadrupole moments, which measure the shape of the nucleus\nin the respective state, show a similar behavior.\nThe results are discussed in the following first in the context\nof a simplifying phenomenological two-level mixing model,\nand then on the basis of more elaborated nuclear structure\ncalculations. Model-independent shape parameters based on\nthe quadrupole sum rule method will be deduced and discussed\nin the final section.\nA. Shape coexistence in a two-state mixing model\nThe two-state mixing model is a simple and useful first\napproach for interpreting the properties of physical states based\non the mixing of different intrinsic configurations. The model\nis based on the assumption of two regular rotational bands with\ncollective in-band transitions, but no \u201ccross talk\u201d between the\nintrinsic states of the different bands. The mixing of states\nwith the same spin-parity I\u03c0 is described by a mixing angle\n\u03b8I . The model is often used to deduce mixing properties from\nthe energy displacement of the states with respect to an ideal\nrotor, as was done for example in Ref. [7]. It is now possible\nto test the validity of the model description for the transitional\nmatrix elements. The observed physical states |I1,2\u3009 can be\nwritten as a linear combination of the intrinsic pure prolate\nand oblate states |Ipr\u3009 and |Iob\u3009, respectively,\n|I1\u3009 = + cos\u03b8I |Ipr\u3009 + sin\u03b8I |Iob\u3009,\n|I2\u3009 = \u2212 sin\u03b8I |Ipr\u3009 + cos\u03b8I |Iob\u3009.\nThe condition of no \u201ccross talk\u201d between the bands means that\nfor all states I, J :\n\u3008Iob\u2016M(E2)\u2016Jpr\u3009 = 0.\nThe observed matrix elements between the different 2+ and\n0+ states can then be expressed in terms of the \u201cpure\u201d matrix\nelements and the mixing angles:\nM11 = \u300821\u2016M(E2)\u201601\u3009\n= sin\u03b80sin\u03b82\u30082ob\u2016M(E2)\u20160ob\u3009\n+ cos\u03b80cos\u03b82\u30082pr\u2016M(E2)\u20160pr\u3009,\nM12 = \u300821\u2016M(E2)\u201602\u3009\n= cos\u03b80sin\u03b82\u30082ob\u2016M(E2)\u20160ob\u3009\n\u2212 sin\u03b80cos\u03b82\u30082pr\u2016M(E2)\u20160pr\u3009,\nM21 = \u300822\u2016M(E2)\u201601\u3009\n= sin\u03b80cos\u03b82\u30082ob\u2016M(E2)\u20160ob\u3009\n\u2212 cos\u03b80sin\u03b82\u30082pr\u2016M(E2)\u20160pr\u3009,\nM22 = \u300822\u2016M(E2)\u201602\u3009\n= cos\u03b80cos\u03b82\u30082ob\u2016M(E2)\u20160ob\u3009\n+ sin\u03b80sin\u03b82\u30082pr\u2016M(E2)\u20160pr\u3009.\nSolving the system of equations yields the following expres-\nsions:\ntan\u03b80 = A \u00b1\n\u221a\nA2 + 1, (2)\nwith\nA = M\n2\n11 + M221 \u2212 M212 \u2212 M222\n2(M11M12 + M21M22) ,\ntan\u03b82 = M11tan\u03b80 + M12\nM21tan\u03b80 + M22 ,\n\u30082pr\u2016M(E2)\u20160pr\u3009 = M11cos\u03b82 \u2212 M21sin\u03b82\ncos\u03b80\n,\n\u30082ob\u2016M(E2)\u20160ob\u3009 = M21cos\u03b82 + M11sin\u03b82\nsin\u03b80\n.\nThe latter matrix elements can be used to calculate the intrinsic\nquadrupole moments Q0 for the bands with pure prolate and\n054313-14\nSHAPE COEXISTENCE IN NEUTRON-DEFICIENT . . .

The resulting\nmixing angles and quadrupole moments are given in table XII.\nThe system of equations has two solutions [see Eq. (2)], which\nare labeled + and \u2212 in the table.\nBoth solutions for 74Kr yield a nearly maximum mixing for\nthe two 0+ states. The first solution +, however, results in a\nmostly oblate 2+1 and mostly prolate 2\n+\n2 state, in contradiction\nto the signs of the diagonal matrix elements. The large\nquadrupole moment for the oblate and small quadrupole\nmoment for the prolate band of this solution are also in\ncontradiction to the experimental results, which suggest the\nopposite. Therefore it seems legitimate to discard the + and\nadopt the \u2212 solution. The squared mixing amplitude of the\nprolate configuration in the ground state is thus found to be\ncos2\u03b80 = 0.48(2), in perfect agreement with the value 0.48(1)\nextracted from the positions of the low-spin states with respect\nto a rotor reference [7]. The squared mixing amplitude of\ncos2\u03b82 = 0.82(20) for the prolate configuration in the 2+1 state\nshows that the purity of the wave functions increases rapidly\nwith spin. The higher-lying states of the ground-state band\ncan be considered to have a pure prolate configuration. The\nquadrupole moment Qpr0 = 3.6(5) eb agrees well with the\nexperimental values of Qt0 \u2248 3.1 eb found for the transitions\nof the ground-state band above the 2+1 state (see Table X).\nThe small value found for the quadrupole moment Qob0 shows\nagain that the absolute deformation for the oblate band is much\nsmaller than for the prolate band, even though the uncertainty\nis rather large.\nUnder the assumption of the model, i.e., for a constant\nquadrupole moment within the intrinsic bands of pure configu-\nration, one can use the mixing angles and quadrupole moments\nof Table XII to calculate further matrix elements, e.g.,\n\u300821\u2016M(E2)\u201621\u3009 = \u221254\n\u221a\n2\n7\u03c0\n(\nQ\npr\n0 cos\n2\u03b82 + Qob0 sin2\u03b82\n)\n,\n\u300822\u2016M(E2)\u201622\u3009 = \u221254\n\u221a\n2\n7\u03c0\n(\nQ\npr\n0 sin\n2\u03b82 + Qob0 cos2\u03b82\n)\n,\n\u300821\u2016M(E2)\u201622\u3009 = 54\n\u221a\n2\n7\u03c0\nsin\u03b82cos\u03b82\n(\nQ\npr\n0 \u2212 Qob0\n)\n.\nThe results are given in the lower part of Table XII. The matrix\nelements found with the second (\u2212) solution for 74Kr are\nin reasonable agreement with the experimental values (see\nTables X and XI). The opposite signs of the matrix element for\nthe first (+) solution show again the validity of adopting the \u2212\nsolution. The two-level mixing model describes the situation\nin 74Kr very consistently despite its simplicity and limitations.\nIn particular, it supports the assumption of maximum mixing\nbetween a strongly prolate (\u03b22 \u2248 0.4) and a weaker oblate\nconfiguration (\u03b22 \u2248 \u22120.1) for the 0+ states.\nTABLE XII.

CL \u00b4EMENT et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 054313 (2007)\nThe two-level mixing model works less well for 76Kr.\nNone of the two solutions is consistent with mostly prolate\nconfigurations for both the 0+1 and 2\n+\n1 states. The mixing\nangle \u03b80 of the + solution agrees well with cos2(\u03b8 ) = 0.73(1)\nfound by Bouchez et al. [7], but in this case only a small\nprolate amplitude is found for the 2+1 state. The \u2212 solution\ncorresponds to a predominantly prolate 2+1 state, but then the\n0+1 state is found predominantly oblate, in contradiction to\nthe experimental result. The absolute values found for the\nquadrupole moments of the pure bands seem to be more\nconsistent with the \u2212 solution. The signs of the diagonal\nmatrix elements for the 2+ states agree with the \u2212 solution,\nbut the sign of the interband matrix element \u300821\u2016M(E2)\u201623\u3009\nfavors the + solution, even though the absolute value from the\ntwo-level mixing model is much too large. The insufficiency\nof the model for 76Kr is probably due to the strong coupling\nwith the presumed quasi-gamma band, in particular between\nthe 2+2 and 2\n+\n3 states. The different coupling of the oblate 2+\nstate in 74Kr and 76Kr is also reflected in the signs of the\ntransitional matrix elements to the 0+1 and 2\n+\n1 states, which are\nopposite for 74Kr and 76Kr. Instead of trying to include more\nstates, e.g., in a three-band mixing model, the experimental\nmatrix elements are compared in the following to theoretical\ncalculations based on mean-field models, which go beyond\nthe static approach and are able to include full configuration\nmixing.\nB. Shape coexistence in mean-\ufb01eld based models\nNuclear bulk properties are well described throughout\nthe nuclear chart by self-consistent mean-field models. To\ndescribe dynamic correlation effects and, for example, col-\nlective excitations, one has to go beyond the static mean-field\napproach. A technique that is well suited to describe shape\ncoexistence is the generator coordinate method (GCM) with\nthe quadrupole moment as generator coordinate. The method\ndetermines the configuration mixing in a variational way\nand provides excitation spectra and matrix elements. Self-\nconsistent Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculations have been\nperformed using the Gogny D1S force and the GCM approach\nwith Gaussian overlap approximation. A five-dimensional col-\nlective Hamiltonian is used accounting for the axial and triaxial\ndeformation and the three rotational degrees of freedom. The\nformalism is described in more detail in Ref. [30].\nPartial results of the calculations have already been pre-\nsented in Tables V, VI, X, and XI, where the spectroscopic\nquadrupole moments and the transition probabilities for\nin-band and out-of-band transitions are compared to the\nexperimental values and to recent calculations using a similar\napproach by Bender et al. [21]. The latter calculations are per-\nformed with the Skyrme SLy6 force and a density-dependent\npairing interaction. Bender et al. use the full GCM approach\nand mixing of the mean-field configurations after projection on\nangular momentum and particle number. The calculations are,\nhowever, restricted to axially symmetric shapes. Possible K =\n2 states, for example, are therefore outside the model space.\nFigure 15 compares the experimental B(E2) values and\nquadrupole moments with the calculations as a function of\nFIG. 15.

The excitation energies of the prolate and\noblate states and the transition strengths between them are\ncompared in the level schemes of Fig. 16. In the figures and the\nfollowing discussion the calculations of the present work and\nthat of Bender et al. are referred to as \u201cGogny\u201d and \u201cSkyrme,\u201d\nrespectively. It should be noted, however, that there are other\ndifferences between the two approaches besides the effective\ninteraction.\nFirst it is observed that the calculation based on the Skyrme\nforce does not reproduce the energies of the states correctly.\nIt finds a predominantly oblate ground state and an excited\nprolate configuration for both 74Kr and 76Kr in contrast to the\nexperimental results, which give firm evidence for the prolate\ncharacter of the ground-state band. The spectra found in the\nSkyrme calculation are furthermore too spread out in excitation\nenergy. It should be noted, however, that the experimental\nenergy difference between the 0+1 and 0\n+\n2 states in 74Kr of about\n500 keV is mostly due to the repulsion of the strongly mixed\nstates, and that the intrinsic prolate and oblate configurations\nare therefore almost degenerate. Small deviations in energy\ncan thus change the ordering of the prolate and oblate states\nin the calculation. The fact that Bender et al. find an oblate\nground state also for 76Kr and even for 78Kr is a deficiency that\nwas explained by the relative position of certain single-particle\nlevels, which might not be correctly reproduced with the SLy6\neffective interaction [21]. Another possible explanation is the\nrestriction of the Skyrme calculation to axial shapes.\nThe five-dimensional calculation based on the Gogny force\nreproduces not only the excitation energies of the prolate\nand oblate rotational bands, but finds also a 2+, 4+, and\n6+ state with predominant K = 2 character in 76Kr very\nclose to the experimentally observed states of the presumed\ngamma-vibrational band.\nThe transition strengths within the prolate band and in\nparticular the decrease toward the ground state are well\nreproduced by both calculations. The deformation for the states\nof higher spin is found somewhat too large in the Skyrme\n054313-16\nSHAPE COEXISTENCE IN NEUTRON-DEFICIENT . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 054313 (2007)\nFIG. 16.

The very large matrix element between the prolate\n2+1 and the excited 0\n+\n2 state is well reproduced by the Gogny\ncalculation, while it is strongly underestimated by the Skyrme\ncalculation. It should be noted that the B(E2) values of Fig. 16\nare always given in the direction of the transition and may\ntherefore differ by a factor of 2Ii + 1 in some cases where the\nordering is reversed.\nA grouping of the non-yrast states above the 0+2 state into\nband structures is not straightforward. The excitation energies\nof the 2+2 , 3\n+\n1 , 4\n+\n2 , 5\n+\n1 , and 6\n+\n2 states in both isotopes are\nconsistent with an interpretation of these sequences as gamma-\nvibrational bands. The Gogny-based calculation reproduces\nthese sequences very well and confirms a predominant K = 2\ncharacter of the states. In this scenario the 2+3 states in both\nisotopes can be interpreted as rotational states with oblate\ncharacter built on the excited 0+2 states. The excitation energies\nand transition strengths found in the Gogny calculation are\nin agreement with this interpretation, as is the sign of the\nexperimental diagonal matrix elements for the 2+3 states.\nThe calculation finds strong mixing of K = 0 and K = 2\ncomponents for the 2+2 and 2\n+\n3 states in both isotopes, which\nblurs a clear classification of the states.\nIt is interesting to note that experimentally the 2+2 state\ncouples differently in 74Kr and 76Kr: In 74Kr the state decays\nwith equal strengths to the 2+1 and 0\n+\n2 states, whereas in\n76Kr it decays almost entirely to the 0+2 state. The different\ncharacter of the 2+2 states in the two isotopes is also seen\nin the diagonal matrix elements, where opposite signs are\nfound experimentally. If one assumes K = 2 for the 2+2\nstates, the negative sign of the diagonal matrix element in\n76Kr corresponds to oblate shape, which would explain the\npredominant decay to the 0+2 state. The positive sign found for\nthe 2+2 state in 74Kr corresponds to prolate shape under the\nassumption of K = 2. This difference is not reproduced by\nthe Gogny calculation, where the 2+2 states can be interpreted\nas gamma bands in the usual sense built on the ground\nstate.\nA detailed comparison of the spectroscopic quadrupole\nmoments (see Tables VI, XI, and Fig. 15) is somewhat\nhampered by the rather large uncertainties of the experimental\nvalues. The spectroscopic quadrupole moments for the 4+ and\n6+ states, in particular the very large experimental values for\n76Kr, should be taken with care since their non-yrast partners\nare not known. Taking this into account, both the Gogny and\nthe Skyrme calculations are in reasonable agreement with the\nexperiment.\nIt can be concluded that configuration-mixing calculations\nare a valid approach to describe the shape-coexistence phe-\nnomenon. The experimental set of matrix elements in 74Kr and\n76Kr represents a stringent test of the theoretical models. While\nthe calculation of Bender et al. describes many global features\nof shape coexistence in the light krypton isotopes correctly,\ncertain details are not reproduced, in particular the ordering of\nthe prolate and oblate states. The agreement with the Gogny\ncalculation, on the other hand, is remarkable. This suggests\nthat it is important to include the triaxial degree of freedom in\nthe calculations. This result will be discussed in more detail in\na forthcoming article from the theoretical perspective [31].\n054313-17\nE. CL \u00b4EMENT et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 054313 (2007)\nC. Rotational invariants and the sum-rule method\nFinally, the matrix elements are analyzed using a model-\nindependent description of the nuclear shape in terms of\nglobal quadrupole-deformation parameters. This can be done\nby constructing rotational invariants of zero-coupled products\nof the E2 operator, which can be linked to the deformation\nparameters in the intrinsic frame of the nucleus [8,16].\nThe electric quadrupole operator E(\u03bb = 2, \u00b5) is a spherical\ntensor that can be parameterized in the principal axes frame\nusing the two parameters Q and \u03b4 as:\nE(2, 0) = Qcos(\u03b4),\nE(2, 1) = E(2,\u22121) = 0,\nE(2, 2) = E(2,\u22122) = 1\u221a\n2\nQsin(\u03b4).\nThe parameter Q measures the overall deformation and is\nequivalent to the elongation parameter \u03b2 in the Bohr model,\nwhereas \u03b4 is related to the triaxiality parameter \u03b3 . The simplest\nzero-coupled products of the E2 operator can then be written\nas:\n\u3008I\u2016[E2 \u00d7 E2]0\u2016I \u3009 =\nQ2\u221a\n5\n,\n\u3008I\u2016{[E2 \u00d7 E2]2 \u00d7 E2}0\u2016I \u3009 = \u2212\n\u221a\n2\n35\nQ3cos(3\u03b4).\nThe E2 invariants can be expressed in the laboratory frame\nby an expansion over all possible intermediate states using\nWigner\u2019s 6j symbols:\n\u3008Ii\u2016[E2 \u00d7 E2]0\u2016Ii\u3009\n= ( \u2212 1)\n2Ii\n\u221a\n2Ii + 1\n\u2211\nj\n\u3008Ii\u2016M(E2)\u2016Ij \u3009\u3008Ij\u2016M(E2)\u2016Ii\u3009\n\u00d7\n{\n2 2 0\nIi Ii Ij\n}\n,\n\u3008Ii\u2016{[E2 \u00d7 E2]2 \u00d7 E2}0\u2016Ii\u3009\n= 1\n2Ii + 1\n\u2211\nj,k\n\u3008Ii\u2016M(E2)\u2016Ij \u3009\n\u00d7\u3008Ij\u2016M(E2)\u2016Ik\u3009\u3008Ik\u2016M(E2)\u2016Ii\u3009\n{\n2 2 2\nIi Ij Ik\n}\n.\nIf the relevant matrix elements are experimentally known,\nthe deformation parameters can be determined in a model-\nindependent way by summing over all closed loops of E2\nmatrix elements, including diagonal ones, connected to a\nspecific state. This method is particularly useful to attribute\nshape parameters to 0+ states, which are not directly accessible\nin the laboratory frame. Besides statistical errors of the\nE2 matrix elements, an additional systematic error comes\nfrom an incomplete knowledge of the matrix elements.

Quadrupole deformation parameters obtained by the\nsum-rule method for the 0+ states in 74Kr and 76Kr.\nunknown matrix elements. The analysis of the rotational\ninvariants in the present case of 74Kr and 76Kr has therefore\nbeen restricted to the 0+ states, so that only the transitional\nmatrix elements \u30080i\u2016M(E2)\u20162j \u3009 and \u30082i\u2016M(E2)\u20162j \u3009 and\nthe diagonal matrix elements \u30082i\u2016M(E2)\u20162i\u3009 have to be\nconsidered. In deformed nuclei most of the E2 strength is\nexhausted by the first rotational 2+ state. Due to the shape\ncoexistence and configuration mixing also the excited 2+ states\ncontribute significantly to the shape parameters of the 0+ states\nin the krypton isotopes. Extending the analysis to states of\nhigher spin seems unreliable because the set of matrix elements\ncannot be considered to be complete for higher-spin states.\nThe resulting quadrupole deformation parameters for the\nfirst and second 0+ states in 74Kr and 76Kr are presented in\nFig. 17. The Q2 parameter is very similar for the ground\nstates in 74Kr and 76Kr. It seems surprising that in 74Kr the\ndeformation parameter for the excited oblate 0+2 state is larger\nthan that of the prolate ground state, even though the absolute\nvalue of the experimental quadrupole moment is larger for\nthe prolate 2+1 than for either of the non-yrast 2+ states. The\ndifference between the ground state and excited 0+2 state is\neven more pronounced in 76Kr. The extremely large Q2 value\nof the 0+2 state is related to the strong coupling of this state to all\nthree 2+ states, in particular to the 2+2 state. It is interesting to\nnote in this context that the experimental quadrupole moment\nof the oblate 2+3 state is indeed very large, and also the analysis\nin the two-band mixing model suggests a rather large oblate\ndeformation, so that there seems to be experimental evidence\nfor an increase in oblate deformation from 74Kr to 76Kr.\nThe parameter cos(3\u03b4) suggests an almost purely prolate\nshape for the ground state of 76Kr and a mostly prolate shape\nwith some triaxiality for the ground state of 74Kr. An oblate\ntriaxial shape is found for the excited 0+2 state in 76Kr and\nmaximum triaxiality for the 0+2 state in 74Kr. The results\nfound for the triaxiality parameter cos(3\u03b4) are in qualitative\nagreement with the findings of the two-band mixing model.\nThe mixing of prolate and oblate configurations leads to a\ncertain triaxiality of the 0+ states. In the case of 74Kr the\nmaximum mixing between a large prolate and smaller oblate\ndeformation could introduce a slight triaxiality in the ground\nstate, but affect the shape of the 0+2 state much stronger,\nresulting in a shape with large triaxiality. The results again\n054313-18\nSHAPE COEXISTENCE IN NEUTRON-DEFICIENT . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 054313 (2007)\nconfirm the importance of the triaxial degree of freedom for\nthe description of the shape coexistence phenomenon.\nD. Conclusions\nThe discussion in the previous sections has shown that a\nconsistent description of the complex shape coexistence and\ninterpretation of the experimental data can be achieved by\nsophisticated theoretical calculations going beyond the static\nmean-field approach by including the mixing of many basis\nstates. It is found that the structure of the low-lying states\nin the light krypton isotopes is dominated by the coexistence\nof prolate and oblate configurations. The phenomenological\ntwo band-mixing model gives some insight into the mixing\nof the wave functions, but it is clearly too simple to describe\nall experimental data. The formalism of quadrupole sum rules\nis useful to derive shape parameters in a model-independent\nway, in particular for 0+ states. However, the requirement of\ncomplete sets of matrix elements limits the applicability of the\nmethod.\nConfiguration-mixing calculations based on mean-field\nmodels and the generator-coordinate method offer the pos-\nsibility to describe the physical states, including transition\nstrengths and spectroscopic quadrupole moments. The ob-\ntained agreement with the experimental data is satisfying,\nkeeping in mind that there are no free parameters to adjust,\nand that the effective interactions are derived globally. From\nthe results it seems clear that the triaxial degree of freedom\nmust be included into such calculations. To further conclude\nabout the effective interaction, it would be instructive to\nperform configuration-mixing calculations with the Gogny\ninteraction while enforcing axial symmetry, and, on a longer-\nterm perspective, to include triaxiality in the approach based\non the Skyrme interaction.\nVI. SUMMARY\nShape coexistence in the light krypton isotopes was studied\nin two low-energy Coulomb excitation experiments using the\nradioactive 74Kr and 76Kr beams of the SPIRAL facility.\nTransitional and diagonal matrix elements of low-lying states\nin 74Kr and 76Kr were extracted from the observed\u03b3 -ray yields.\nThe transition strengths are in good agreement with the results\nof a recent lifetime measurement. Using the precise lifetimes\nas additional input in the analysis of the Coulomb excitation\ndata enhanced the sensitivity to the reorientation effect and\nallowed extracting spectroscopic quadrupole moments for\nseveral excited states. The negative diagonal matrix elements\nof the states in the ground-state bands of both isotopes\nunder study prove their prolate character. The excited 2+2 and\n2+3 states are interpreted as gamma-vibrational and oblate\nrotational states, respectively. However, a clear classification\nof the states is difficult due to the mixing of prolate and oblate\nconfigurations, on one hand, and K = 0 and K = 2 configu-\nrations, on the other hand.\nThe matrix elements were interpreted in a phenomenologi-\ncal two-band mixing model. The results confirm the earlier\nfinding of maximum mixing between prolate and oblate\nconfigurations in the wave functions of the 0+ states in\n74Kr. The purity of the wave functions increases rapidly with\nspin, explaining the increase in the transition strength and at\nthe same time the very strong interband transitions between\nthe different 2+ and 0+ states. However, the model fails to\ndescribe consistently the band mixing in 76Kr, probably due\nto the strong coupling with the presumed gamma-vibrational\nband. The quadrupole sum rule formalism was applied to\nderive shape parameters for the 0+ states.\nThe transition strengths and quadrupole moments are com-\npared to recent theoretical calculations going beyond the static\nmean-field approach. The confrontation of the calculations\nwith the large set of experimental matrix elements represents a\nstringent test of the models and effective interactions. The\nresults emphasize the importance of including the triaxial\ndegree of freedom to describe the shape coexistence in the\nlight krypton isotopes.\nThe present work represents the first direct experimental\nproof of the proposed shape coexistence scenario, and the\nreorientation effect has been exploited for the first time with\na radioactive ion beam. The ground-state shape of the N =\nZ nucleus 72Kr is expected to be dominated by the oblate\nconfiguration. The relatively small B(E2; 0+1 \u2192 2+1 ) value\nfound for 72Kr in an intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation\nexperiment has been interpreted as favoring an oblate shape\n[32], but cannot prove the inversion of the ground-state shape\nfor 72Kr. The measurement of quadrupole moments in 72Kr\nremains a challenge for future low-energy Coulomb excitation\nexperiments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the technical staff at\nGANIL for excellent support.
