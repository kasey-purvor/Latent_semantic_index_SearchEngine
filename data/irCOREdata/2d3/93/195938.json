NO donors have been demonstrated\nto relax the myometrium [1] and maintain uterine quies-\ncence [2]. CO has been demonstrated to relax smooth\nmuscle, including human myometrium via a sGC-cGMP\nmechanism [3]. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is another\ngasotransmitter that has many parallels with NO and CO\n[4], however there are no reports to date on the produc-\ntion of H2S in reproductive tissues. H2S is endogenously\nproduced from L-cysteine by two pyridoxal 5' phosphate-\ndependent enzymes cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) and\ncystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) [5-7]. A high expression of\nCBS has been found in the central nervous system [8]\nwhile CSE is highly expressed in vascular tissues in the rat\n[9]. An early study by Smythe [10] observed the produc-\ntion of H2S in rat liver from L-cysteine. In more recent\nstudies various mammalian tissues have been shown to\nproduce H2S, including the brain (50\u2013160 \u03bcM), the\nileum, the kidneys and vascular tissue [8,11,12].\nThe physiological roles of H2S have been well established.\nAbe and Kimura [8] suggested possible role of H2S as an\nendogenous neuromodulator in rat brain tissue, where it\nis involved in synaptic transmission. In the cardiovascular\nsystem H2S acts as a vasodilator both in vivo and in vitro\nand reduces blood pressure in vivo. The mechanism of\naction of H2S is unknown. However, unlike NO, H2S\ndilates blood vessels possibly via a novel mechanism that\ninvolves the opening of K+ ATP channels [13]. The role of\nH2S as an inflammatory mediator is supported by the\npharmacological inhibition of H2S biosynthesis by the\nCSE enzyme inhibitor D,L-propargylglycine or \u03b2-cyano-L-\nalanine in conditions such as acute pancreatitis, haemor-\nrhagic shock and endotoxemia [14-16]. H2S as a smooth\nmuscle relaxant has been investigated in various smooth\nmuscle tissues. The H2S donor sodium hydrosulphide\n(NaHS) relaxed guinea pig and rat ileum smooth muscle\nand also the thoracic aorta and portal vein [11,17]. Sidhu\net al. [18] showed that NaHS relaxed isolated pregnant rat\nuterine strips in vitro, demonstrating the role of H2S as a\nsmooth muscle relaxant. However the study did not inves-\ntigate the production of H2S or the expression of the CBS\nand CSE enzymes in intrauterine tissues, and this has not\nbeen reported previously.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the endog-\nenous production of H2S and identify the expression of\nCBS and CSE enzymes in rat and human intrauterine tis-\nsues.\nMethods\nTissue collection\nTissue was collected from 36 pregnant Sprague-Dawley\nrats (175\u2013250 g) at 19 days of gestation and from 4 non-\npregnant Sprague-Dawley rats in the proestrous stage of\nthe oestrous cycle, in accordance with the Home Office\nGuidance on the Operation of Animals (Scientific Proce-\ndures) Act 1986. Rat tissue was collected at 19 days of ges-\ntation as samples were required close to term, but not at\nterm, which corresponds to a time frame in human preg-\nnancy when premature labour or pre-eclampsia could\noccur. In pregnant rats, the uterus was incised and samples\nof the amnion were dissected from the complete amniotic\nsac, placentas were then removed from their attachment\nsites and cleaned of any fetal membrane attachments.\nFinally, whole samples of uterus were dissected out and\nretained. In non-pregnant rats samples of the whole\nuterus were dissected out. Samples of liver were retained\nfrom each animal in order to provide positive controls. All\ntissue samples were washed with sterile saline to remove\nexcess blood.\nHuman placentas with attached amnion and myometrial\nsamples were collected at four elective Caesarean sections\nat term from normal pregnancies with informed consent\nfrom the Women's Unit at University Hospital Coventry\nand Warwickshire, with ethical approval from Coventry\nLocal Research Ethics Committee. Samples of amnion\nwere removed from the placentas and 2 cm core samples\nof the placenta were obtained. Small samples of myo-\nmetrium were retained during the Caesarean section pro-\ncedure. Unfortunately, samples from pre-eclamptic\nplacentas were not available in sufficient numbers for sta-\ntistical comparison. All tissue samples were washed with\nsterile saline to remove excess blood and were stored at -\n80\u00b0C until use.\nEndogenous production of H2S\nThe endogenous production of H2S was measured using\nthe methylene blue assay method of Zhao et al. [12] with\nmodifications. Ten grams of tissue were homogenised in\n6\u20139 ml of ice-cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer\n(pH 6.8). Fifty percent tissue homogenate was added to\nten 30 ml capacity universal containers loaded with a reac-\ntion mixture of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH\n7.4), 2 mM pyridoxal 5'phosphate and 10 mM L-cysteine.\nSmall plastic test tubes were used as centre wells contain-\ning 1% zinc acetate (0.5 ml) with a 5.5 cm filter paper to\ntrap evolved H2S. Septum lids were placed on the univer-\nsal tubes which were then transferred to a shaking water\nbath at 37\u00b0C and incubated for 6 hours. The reaction was\nstopped after 6 hours by the injection of 50% trichloro-\nacetic acid (0.5 ml) via the septum lid into the reaction\nmixture. To ensure maximum trapping of evolved hydro-\ngen sulphide the reaction was allowed to incubate for aPage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:10 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/7\/1\/10further 1 hour in the shaking water bath. The methylene\nblue assay was used to measure the sulphide concentra-\ntion of the centre well contents. The contents of the centre\nwells were transferred to test tubes and the following were\nadded to each tube: 3.5 ml of distilled water, 0.4 ml of\nN,N-dimethyl-p-phenyldiamine sulphate (20 mM in 7.2\nM HCl) and 0.4 ml of ferric chloride (30 mM in 1.2 HCl).\nThe tubes were incubated at room temperature for 20\nminutes. The absorbance was measured at 670 nm on a\nspectrophotometer (Cecil, Cambridge, UK). Calibration\nstandards were prepared using a 10 mM stock solution of\nNaHS to produce a standard calibration curve. Sulphide\nconcentrations were measured and the production rate of\nH2S was calculated. The experiment was run in parallel\nwithout L-cysteine in the reaction mixture, as a negative\ncontrol. The effect of NO on H2S production was investi-\ngated using the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP)\n(Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). The reaction mixture was\nincubated with 1 \u03bcM of SNP. The production of H2S\nunder low oxygen conditions was investigated by flushing\nnitrogen gas into the universal tubes containing reaction\nmixture before sealing with septum lids. The concentra-\ntion of oxygen in the reaction tubes was not measured. All\nexperimental runs involved ten replicates.\nWestern blotting\nThe expression of CBS and CSE was investigated in rat and\nhuman intrauterine tissues using Western blotting. Tissue\nwas lysed in lysis buffer and left to incubate on ice for 60\nminutes. Supernatants were retained by centrifugation at\n14,000 g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant samples (50\n\u03bcg\/\u03bcl) were prepared for Western blot with loading buffer.\nSamples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for 55\nminutes at 150 V. The transfer of proteins was checked\nwith Ponceau stain (Sigma, Poole, UK). The SDS-PAGE\ngel was transferred to PVDF membrane (Amersham, Buck-\ninghamshire, UK) at 50 V for 2 hours. 5% non-fat dried\nmilk was used to block the membrane. The primary anti-\nbodies for CSE and CBS were home made at Lakehead\nUniversity (Canada). The membrane was then incubated\nwith the primary antibody (dilution 1:500) overnight at\n4\u00b0C. Primary antibody was removed by three 5 minute\nwashes with TBST. The membrane was incubated with sec-\nondary antibody (dilution 1:5000 for both goat anti-\nmouse and goat anti-rabbit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for\n1 hour at room temperature. Secondary antibody was\nremoved by three 5 minute washes with TBST. The ECL\nPlus Western Blotting detection kit (Amersham, Little\nChalfont, UK) was used to detect the presence of the\nenzymes using the ChemiDoc EQ imager (Bio-Rad,\nHemel Hempstead, UK). The PVDF membranes were rep-\nrobed with the loading control \u03b2-actin based on the\nmethod used by Liao et al. [19] with some modifications.\nAfter incubation with the ECL Plus Western Blotting\ndetection kit, the PVDF membranes were kept in fresh\nTBST at 4\u00b0C for 24 hours. The PVDF membranes were\nwashed three times for 5 minutes with TBST. These mem-\nbranes were reprobed with \u03b2-actin antibody (Abcam,\nCambridge, UK) (dilution 1:1000) in 5% milk (non-fat\ndried milk) overnight. The ECL Plus Western Blotting\ndetection kit was used to detect the presence of \u03b2-actin.\nRat kidney was used as a positive control for CBS, as it has\npreviously been detected in rat kidney [20]. For CSE the\npositive control used was rat aorta. Non-pregnant (NP) rat\nuterus was also investigated for the expression of both\nCBS and CSE (n = 4).\nThe following rat tissues were investigated: uterus, pla-\ncenta and fetal membranes (amnion) (n = 4). Human tis-\nsues investigated were: chorion, amnion, myometrium\nand placenta (n = 4). The Western blotting technique used\nwas qualitative.\nStatistical analysis\nH2S production rates in nM min-1 g-1 wet tissue are shown\nas mean \u00b1 SD. Mean production rates were compared\nusing Student's T test for unrelated samples or ANOVA\nwith a LSD posthoc test corrected for repeated tests, as\nappropriate. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant.\nResults\nAssay validation\nThe coefficient of variation for the methylene blue assay\nwas 5.7%. The intrapair correlation was 0.975 (P < 0.001).\nBasal production of H2S in rat liver, rat intrauterine tissues \nand human placenta\nRat intrauterine tissue and human placenta homogenates\nproduced H2S from L-cysteine in vitro (Table 1). Rat liver\nhomogenate (positive control) produced H2S at a much\nhigher rate than the rat intrauterine tissues (Table 1). The\norder of H2S production rates was rat liver > human pla-\ncenta > rat uterus > rat fetal membranes > rat placenta\n(Table 1).\nEndogenous production of H2S in the presence of a nitric \noxide donor\nFor rat liver there was a trend of increased production of\nH2S in the presence of the NO donor, however the differ-\nence in mean production rates did not reach significance\n(Table 2). A similar trend was observed for rat uterus and\nrat placenta homogenates (Table 2). For rat fetal mem-\nbranes H2S production was significantly elevated in the\npresence of the NO donor (p < 0.05) (Table 2).\nEndogenous production of H2S under low oxygen \nconditions\nUnder low oxygen conditions production of H2S was sig-\nnificantly increased compared to room air oxygen condi-Page 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:10 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/7\/1\/10tions for rat liver, uterus and fetal membranes (P < 0.05),\nbut not rat placenta (Table 3). For human placenta there\nwas a significant increase in H2S production under low\noxygen conditions (P < 0.05) (Table 3).\nExpression of CBS and CSE in rat intrauterine tissues\nFigure 1 shows the expression of CBS in rat intrauterine\ntissues. Expression of CBS was detected at 15 kDa in rat\ntissues (Fig. 1a), while expression of CSE was detected at\n43 kDa in all tissues investigated (Fig. 1b). \u03b2-actin was\nused as a loading control for each Western blot and was\ndetected at 42 kDa.\nExpression of CBS and CSE in human intrauterine tissues\nExpression of CBS was detected at about 48 kDa in all\nhuman tissue samples (Fig. 1c). The same human samples\nwere used to investigate the expression of CSE in intrauter-\nine tissues. CSE expression was detected at 43 kDa in all\nhuman tissues (Fig. 1d). \u03b2-actin was used as loading con-\ntrols for these Western blots and expression was detected\nat 42 kDa.\nDiscussion\nEndogenous production of H2S in intrauterine tissues\nThe physiological role of H2S in the reproductive system\nhas not been fully investigated.

In the present study we are the first to report the\nproduction of H2S in rat and human intrauterine tissues.\nThe baseline production of H2S in rat intrauterine tissues\nwas established in the present study. The results showed\nthat in the absence of additional L-cysteine all rat intrau-\nterine tissues produced very low levels of H2S, the greatest\nvalue was for rat liver (4.01 \u00b1 3.5 min-1g wet tissue-1). The\ntissue homogenates would have contained some blood\nand a small concentration of endogenous L-cysteine\nwould have been present. It is also possible that when the\nhomogenates were acidified with trichloroacetic acid\nsome sulphide ions present were driven off as H2S.\nWith the addition of 10 mM L-cysteine a significant\nincrease in the production of H2S was observed in all tis-\nsues. Rat liver produced H2S at a significantly higher pro-\nduction rate in comparison to all intrauterine tissues; this\nis possibly due to the high expression of CSE in rat liver\n[6,7]. The present study showed that rat uterus produced\nH2S at a greater rate than rat placenta and fetal mem-\nbranes; the lowest production rate was observed in rat pla-\ncenta. Human placenta exhibited significant H2S\nproduction. The present study showed that H2S can be\nproduced from L-cysteine in intrauterine tissues.\nThe endogenous production of H2S in the presence of a \nnitric oxide donor\nEarlier studies have demonstrated the effect of NO on the\nproduction of H2S. Zhao et al. [12] demonstrated that NO\nup-regulated the production of H2S. In the present study\ncomparison of treatments of L-cysteine and the NO donor\nshowed no significant difference in the production of H2S,\nshowing that the NO donor did not affect the production\nof H2S. Similar results were observed with rat uterus and\nplacenta. In rat fetal membranes the presence of the NO\ndonor showed a significantly (P < 0.05) elevated produc-\ntion rate in comparison to the L-cysteine treatment alone\n(Table 2). A similar result was observed by Zhao et al. [12]\nwhere the production of H2S was up-regulated by SNP in\nrat aortic tissue. Zhao et al. [12] demonstrated that NO up-\nregulated the production of H2S via the cGMP pathway.\nThe mechanism by which NO affects the H2S production\nrate was not investigated in this study. It is not clear why\nthe augmenting effect of SNP only reached significance in\nrat fetal membranes.\nThe endogenous production of H2S under low oxygen \nconditions\nThe present study is the first to demonstrate the increase\nin measured production of H2S under low oxygen condi-\ntions in rat and human intrauterine tissues. The produc-\ntion rate of H2S was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in\nrat liver under low oxygen conditions. Similar results were\nobserved for rat uterus (Table 3).

Rat fetal\nmembranes followed the same trend as rat liver and rat\nuterus under normal and low oxygen conditions. Under\nlow oxygen conditions the production rate of H2S was sig-\nnificantly elevated (P < 0.05). The present study also\ninvestigated the endogenous production of H2S in human\nplacenta under normal and low oxygen conditions. It is\nnot clear why a significant increase was seen for human\nplacenta, but not rat placenta. A significant (P < 0.05)\nincrease in H2S production was observed in human pla-\ncenta under low oxygen conditions. Low oxygen condi-\ntions were used as hypoxia is associated with pre-\neclampsia, where poor placental function can reduce the\nsupply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus resulting in\nintrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and other placen-\ntal dysfunctions. Hypoxia can also bring about other pre-\neclamptic features such as the release of proinflammatory\ncytokines and oxidative stress [21-23]. Hypoxic condi-\ntions can also reduce the uteroplacental perfusion, which\nmay lead to inflammatory conditions i.e. oxidative stress\n[23]. In the present study we found that the endogenous\nproduction of H2S under low oxygen conditions was ele-\nvated in rat uterus, fetal membranes and in human pla-\ncenta in vitro. It is possible that under atmospheric oxygen\nconditions some oxidation of evolved H2S could occur,\nthus reducing the amount of trapped H2S in the assay.\nUnder low oxygen conditions perhaps less H2S was oxi-\ndised, leading to increased measured production rates of\nH2S. However, if it were a simple chemical effect then it\nwould be expected to affect all H2S production measure-\nments equally, but this was not the case (Table 3). For\nexample, measured H2S production from rat placenta was\nnot increased under low oxygen conditions. It seems more\nlikely that the CBS and CSE enzymes could be directly\naffected by oxygen. CBS contains heme in its structure,\nwhich could bind oxygen and affect enzyme function. In\ncomparison, CSE does not contain heme so an alternative\nor novel mechanism could be involved. Clearly there is a\ndifference between low oxygen incubation for tissue\nhomogenates in vitro and physiological hypoxia in vivo.\nThe enzyme function of CBS and CSE appear to be\naffected by oxygen levels. It is possible that increased pro-\nduction of H2S under hypoxic conditions could have a\nrole in the pathology of pre-eclampsia.\nExpression of cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) and \ncystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE)\nThe human CBS gene has been mapped to chromosome 2\nand contains 23 exons. Exons 1\u201314 and 16 encode the\nCBS enzyme. The molecular weight of CBS is 160,000,\nand in human and rat liver the primary translational prod-\nuct of the CBS gene gives rise to tetrameric subunits of 63\nkDa. These subunits are composed of 551 amino acids\nresidues, and the enzyme also contains the pyridoxal 5'-\nphophaste and haem molecule per subunit essential for\nits activity [24,25]. The haem molecule could be the direct\ntarget of NO as it can bind to haem with high affinity. The\nproteolytic cleavage of the 63 kDa subunit yields a 48 kDa\ndimer subunit (40\u2013413 amino acid residue), which is\naccompanied by a 60-fold increase in the enzyme's spe-\ncific activity with physiological concentrations of homo-\ncysteine [24-27].\nThe presence of CSE has previously been found in rat liver\nand in a variety of species including: Neurospora crassa,\nAspergillus nidulans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharo-\nmycopsis lipoltic [28-30]. CSE has a molecular weight of\n166 kDa. Like rat CBS, rat CSE is also composed of 4 iden-\ntical tetrameric subunits at 43 kDa and require pyridoxal\n5'-phophaste for their activity [28,31]. The cDNA\nsequence of rat CSE in comparison to related E. coli\nenzymes (cystathionine \u03b3-synthase and cystathionine \u03b2-\nlyase) share a common ancestral gene as well as identical\ntetrameric subunits at 43 kDa. These enzymes from E. coli\nare also pyridoxal 5'-phophaste dependent [6]. Expression\nof CSE is mainly abundant in vascular tissues, while\nexpression is increased in fetal liver in later stages of devel-\nopment [9,28].\nThe expression of CSE and CBS has previously been\nreported in mammalian tissues. CBS is the main H2S pro-\nducing enzyme in brain tissue [8], while CSE is responsi-\nble for H2S production in vascular tissues [9].\nThe presence of CBS and CSE has not been previously\nreported in rat or human intrauterine tissues. In the\npresent study, the expression of CBS and CSE was detected\nin rat and human intrauterine tissues qualitatively by\nWestern blotting. CBS was detected at 15 kDa in rat kid-\nney (positive control), non-pregnant uterus, pregnant\nuterus, placenta and fetal membranes (Fig. 1a). It is not\nclear why a fragment of CBS was detected at 15 kDa in rat\ntissue, but at 48 kDa in human tissue. Skovby et al.(1984)\n[24] previously reported a 15 kDa peptide cleaved from\nCBS by proteolysis. As the primary antibody used was pol-\nyclonal it is possible that it bound to an epitope on the 15\nkDa fragment from rat CBS. CSE was detected at approxi-\nmately 43 kDa in rat aorta (positive control), non-preg-\nnant uterus, pregnant uterus, placenta and fetal\nmembranes (Fig. 1b). These results are in accordance with\nCheng et al. [9] who previously reported the expression of\nCSE in rat vascular tissues at 43 kDa.\nThe present study also detected the presence of CBS and\nCSE in human intrauterine tissues. Expression of CBS was\ndetected in human chorion, amnion, myometrium and\nplacenta (Fig. 1c). A band at 48 kDa was detected in all tis-\nsues, suggesting CBS expression. However, these results\ndo not agree with the previous findings by Ratnam et al.\n[32] who reported expression of CBS at 63 kDa in rat liverPage 7 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:10 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/7\/1\/10cells. It has been previously reported that rat liver CBS has\na subunit at 48 kDa which can be produced by proteolytic\ncleavage of the 63 kDa subunit [7,24]. The present study\ndetected a band at about 48 kDa, which is likely to be the\nsubunit expression at 48 kDa of CBS. The present study\nalso investigated the expression of CSE in human chorion,\namnion, myometrium and placenta. The results detected\nexpression of CSE at 43 kDa in all human tissues (Fig. 1d).\nThese results agree with similar findings of CSE expression\ndetected at 43 kDa in rat vascular tissues [9].\nThis is the first study to report the detection of both CBS\nand CSE in rat and human intrauterine tissues and the\nproduction of H2S by these tissues. The results demon-\nstrated the endogenous production of H2S in rat and\nhuman intrauterine tissues via CBS and CSE enzymes.\nConclusion\nBasal production of H2S was demonstrated in rat uterus,\nplacenta, fetal membranes and human placenta. The\nendogenous production of H2S was up-regulated by the\nNO donor SNP in rat fetal membranes. Exposure of cell\nhomogenates from rat liver, uterus, fetal membranes and\nhuman placenta, to low oxygen levels increased H2S pro-\nduction rates. The presence of CBS and CSE enzymes was\ndemonstrated, for the first time, in rat and human intrau-\nterine tissues. Endogenously produced H2S could possibly\nhave a role in the pathology of pre-eclampsia, however\nfurther investigation of the role of H2S in the reproductive\nsystem is required.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nPP conducted the laboratory work, analysed the data and\ndrafted the paper.
