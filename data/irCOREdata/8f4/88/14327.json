As a result of the evaluation\nactivities reported here, an online training package is being assembled, which will be made available\nover the Internet.\nIntroduction\nElectronic channels are rapidly taking off as a means of accessing journal literature\n(Lancaster, 1995). Behind the interest lies the increasing concern of academic libraries\nwith the mounting cost of purchasing printed journals. Some commentators believe that\nhigher-education institutions themselves will move into the electronic publishing field in\norder to control expenditure on journals (Okerson and O'Donnell, 1995).\nThis rapid growth in the number of electronic journals available raises the immediate\nquestion - how will all those concerned with journals, as authors, editors, or readers, be\ntrained? The prime purpose of the project described here is to explore the problems of\nproviding such training. It was also planned that student feedback would assist the\nconstruction of an online teaching package.\n13\nJock Meadows et al An online electronic journal for teaching purposes\nA process of iterative development of teaching material, based on student feedback, is\nparticularly appropriate here, since a student's ability to evaluate forms a part of what is\nbeing assessed. The rationale of this approach has been discussed in more detail elsewhere\n(Ramaiah et al, 1995). The approach is designed both to inform and test the student and,\nsimultaneously, to provide feedback that can be used to modify and update the teaching\nmaterial.\nA training electronic journal\nUnderstanding the workings of an electronic journal in such a way as to help others\nnecessarily entails hands-on experience. It requires an ability to manipulate and to modify\nboth contents and appearance. Since it was obviously not possible to make changes to\nexisting electronic journals, the decision was taken to set up a new 'training electronic\njournal'. It was decided that, though the material included in the journal should be\noriginal, it need not necessarily be standard articles.\nTo mimic the problems that might be encountered with a real electronic journal, it was\nnecessary that the training electronic journal should be networked between sites, with\ninput from each site. An electronic journal - InfoTrain - was consequently developed\nbetween three sites - Loughborough University and City University in the UK, and the\nUniversity of South Australia.\nThe training process\nThe process of handling electronic journals involves a number of different activities. It\nwas decided that three were especially important in terms of training. These were:\n1. accessing electronic journals and evaluating interfaces;\n2. refereeing and editing the contents;\n3. evaluating the layout and design of the electronic journal.\nThe students were to be guided in their exploration by handouts and questionnaires. They\nwould use the results of these activities as the basis for their assessed coursework.\nAt Loughborough, the results given here involved 61 first-year and second-year\nundergraduate students taking courses in library, information and publishing studies\nduring the academic year 1994-5. At City, 128 students on postgraduate Masters courses\n(full or part-time) in information science or information systems were involved. In both\nuniversities, the students were divided into small groups for carrying out the required\nwork. The basic material used for study was abstracts of Masters dissertations that had\nbeen recently completed at the two universities.\nEvaluation of the interface\nThe concern in this exercise was in exploring ease of access, navigation and\ncomprehension of the potentialities of different electronic journals. The students at\nLoughborough investigated three electronic journals: an experimental Institute of Physics\n14\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\njournal, an Institute of Electrical Engineers journal, and an issue of InfoTrain from South\nAustralia. They were asked questions about the activities possible with each journal. In\norder to answer these questions, students had to navigate their way through the journals.\nAt City, the students were required to evaluate a section of the issue of InfoTrain\nproduced there (each group looked at a section which had been prepared by one of the\nother groups). The groups also evaluated another refereed electronic journal of their\nchoice from those available without cost via the World Wide Web.\nThe questions asked were of two types: matters of opinion (for example, are icons used\neasy to understand?) and matters of fact (for example, does the journal have hypertext\nlinks within the article?). Responses to questions in the first category indicated that 86 per\ncent to 95 per cent thought that the journals were 'very easy' or 'quite easy' to use.\nThe area that presented some slight difficulty was in understanding menu items and\nidentifying icons. This is not unusual; other studies have found problems here (for\nexample, Sulaiman and Meadows, 1995).\nThe responses to the factual questions give a rather different picture of the students'\nability to cope with an electronic journal. They suggest that the more complex the level of\nnavigation, the greater the student uncertainty. They were asked whether each journal\nallowed browsing at the title and author level, at the abstract level, and through figures,\ndiagrams and tables.\nIn some cases, the incorrect responses formed a majority. Thus, over three-quarters of the\nstudents thought that one of the journals allowed searching within an article when, in\nfact, it did not. It is possible that students misinterpreted the questions in some way. For\nexample, the students were asked about hypertext links from the specific articles studied\nto other documents; it transpired that the meaning of the word 'document' was not clear;\ndid it, for example, include a database?\nThe three electronic journals investigated in this exercise fell into different categories. The\nIEE journal was available commercially; the IOP journal was experimental; InfoTrain was\nan amateur design. Yet these differences were barely discernable in the student responses\n(though, overall, the IEE journal was found somewhat easier to handle).\nContent\nThe purpose of looking at content was to examine how well students could referee and\nedit online material. The material used in this exercise was the abstracts from Masters\ndissertations. Three criticisms of content were much commoner than any other (number\nof mentions given):\n1. poor grammar and style - 44;\n2. poor layout and structure - 36;\n3. the inclusion of unnecessary detail, or irrelevant material - 23.\nThe first refereeing study at Loughborough involved six groups looking at the same\nabstract and commenting on its quality. The different possible responses were given a\nweighting such that the lowest score of 5 corresponded to an abstract that should\n15\nJack Meadows et al An online electronic journal for teaching purposes\ncertainly be rejected, and the highest score of 18 to one that must certainly be accepted.\nThe scores from different groups of students were consistent, ranging only from 10.3 to\n12.5.\nThe next study involved the students in examining a range of different abstracts. Again,\ntheir weighted assessment of each abstract was calculated; the resulting scores ranged\nfrom 6.5 to 18. These scores were compared with their recommendations regarding\npublication (1 = publish without change; 2 = publish with slight modification; 3 = publish\nwith considerable modification; 4 = do not publish). There was a clear correlation\nbetween the weighted score and the recommendation, as would be expected. However,\nboth undergraduates and postgraduates proved loath to recommend rejection, even of\nclearly low-quality abstracts. The spread of refereeing comments was similar to that\nencountered in real-life refereeing of journal articles. Differences manifested themselves\nbetween subject areas; library-oriented topics (library collection development,\nlibrarianship, user education, etc.) were rated less highly than the other areas.\nPresentation\nAt Loughborough, second-year students were asked to design an electronic version of a\nprinted journal with which they were already familiar. They were told to concentrate on\nthe most important pages in information terms: the cover, contents page, first page of an\narticle, etc. The students were split into groups, each of which had to agree a design for its\nelectronic version. Each group was then asked to evaluate the versions produced by the\nother groups. Interestingly, all groups decided to follow the printed version of the journal\nfairly closely, despite the fact that they also thought the transfer led to a rather boring\nappearance. Their argument was that the transition to the electronic version would be\nmore easily made if the electronic environment looked familiar. This reflects the\nviewpoint of many journal readers (Schauder, 1994).\nThere was similarity between the resultant electronic versions, and also in the students'\ncritiques of each others' versions. Their main area of disagreement concerned the correct\namount of material that should be included on each screen. Their discussion actually\nreflected a current debate among human-computer interface designers. The other area\nwhere some disagreement emerged related to the overall organization of the information.\nWork on design and presentation at City concentrated on the abstracts. Although these\nwere text-only, the groups came up with a multiplicity of designs for them. The students\nused HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for presentation. The resultant lack of\ncontrol over the appearance of the final product, given the variety of browsers and their\ncustomizability, led to a number of interesting debates in subsequent class discussions.\nThe approach used at the City suffered from technical problems which led to stages in the\nsequential process falling behind schedule.\nDissemination\nThe provision of different types of material from three separate sites proved valuable in\ndrawing students' attention to some basic problems of dissemination. More especially,\n16\nVolume 5 Number I\nthey found that problems which appear at first sight to be trivial can have a profoundly\ndemotivating effect on users. A typical example is the long wait that is sometimes\nnecessary when InfoTrain material from Australia is accessed. Another is the difference in\ntime required to access text and graphics. InfoTrain can, in principle, be looked at by\nanyone who can access the Internet. This has raised some interesting queries regarding the\nmaterial which is being put up by students - for example, their proposals for the\nelectronic design of journals. Some are worried by the thought that people all over the\nworld may be in a position to criticize their efforts.\nConclusions\nStudent feedback indicates that the teaching-journal approach both stimulates interest\nand creates a feeling that the exercises represent real-life activities. For example, a\nretrospective survey of the students in South Australia found that they all evaluated the\ncourse positively, and two-thirds graded their reaction as very positive. The 'real-life'\naspect was appreciated in comments by Loughborough students.\nThe training electronic journal concept has been tried out with both undergraduate and\npostgraduate students. What is noteworthy is how little difference there was in their\noverall reactions, or in their ability to carry out the exercises. The implication is that the\nconcept should provide a suitable approach to electronic journals for any group with a\nbasic level of computer literacy. An introductory electronic journal training package,\nmodified in the light of the results reported here, will soon be made available via the\nInternet for use by publishers, librarians and information officers, as well as fellow-\nacademics.\nThe results of this study have, however, a wider significance. Problems encountered by\nthese students in using electronic journals appear rather similar to those encountered by\nactual authors, editors and readers. Hence, the project results point up some of the\ndifficulties of the transition from print-based to electronic journals. First, journal users,\nthough they are aware of the potential flexibility of electronic handling, are likely to\nbelieve that, at least initially, electronic journals should mimic the appearance of printed\njournals. Secondly, students have commented on the difficulty of editing and refereeing\nmaterial on-screen. The basic problem is the small amount of material that can be viewed\nat once. Here, again, students have identified a difficulty that has already become evident\nin the publishing world. From a training viewpoint, therefore, InfoTrain has a heuristic\nvalue: by handling it, students can validly infer the problems that really exist. Thirdly,\nstudents misunderstood, or did not understand fully, some of the navigational\npossibilities on offer. This is a problem that publishers can expect to face more generally.\nPerhaps due to uncertain expectations, professionally designed and produced electronic\njournals were not seen as overwhelmingly better than an amateur production.\nReferences\nLancaster, F.W.
