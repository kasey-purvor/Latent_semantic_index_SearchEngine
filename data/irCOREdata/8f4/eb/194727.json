INTRODUCTION\nSelf-assembled InAs quantum dots \u0001QDs\u0002 embedded in\nAlAs barriers are of interest because of their large confine-\nment potential1,2 compared to InAs\/GaAs QDs and their\nconsequent suitability for resonant tunneling devices.3,4 De-\nspite the almost identical lattice mismatch, the formation of\nInAs QDs in AlAs differs considerably from that in GaAs.\nThis is due to the larger Al-In bond strength, which reduces\nIn migration on the AlAs surface, leading to a larger density\nand smaller size of InAs\/AlAs QDs.5 It is these differences\nin size distribution, together with the larger confinement po-\ntential, that are thought to cause the large differences in the\nobserved photoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002 spectra between the two\ntypes of QD.3,5,6 However, the relationship between the dif-\nferences in the spectra, and the properties of the two dot\ntypes is not quantitatively understood because of a lack of\ndetailed structural information on buried InAs\/AlAs QDs.7\nExperimental and theoretical investigation of this topic is the\nsubject of the present work.\nWe determine the shape, size, and composition of the QDs\nby cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy \u0001X-STM\u0002.\nWe show the composition variation in an InAs\/AlAs dot and\nconfirm the inverted trumpetlike indium distribution that has\nbeen assumed in InAs\/GaAs QDs.8\u201311 Based on the X-STM\nresults we then use a single band effective mass approach to\ncalculate the electron and hole states and estimate the ground\nstate PL energy. Our results compare favorably with the mea-\nsured PL spectra and indicate that the large difference in the\nPL spectra of InAs\/GaAs and InAs\/AlAs QDs can be ex-\nplained by the structural properties of the dots. Finally, in the\nlight of these results, we discuss the mechanisms that have\nbeen suggested for the recently observed extremely long \u0001mi-\ncrosecond\u0002 PL decay times of the InAs\/AlAs dots.12\u201314\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe QDs were grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on\ndoped GaAs \u0001100\u0002 wafers. During growth of the QDs the\nsubstrate temperature was maintained at 500 \u00b0C. Each\n1.9\u00b10.1 monolayer \u0001ML\u0002 of InAs was grown in a cycled\nway, i.e., with a 3 s pause after each deposition of 0.25 ML,\nat a low growth rate of 0.043 ML\/s. After a 500 nm n-doped\n\u00011\u00021018 cm\u22122\u0002 GaAs buffer layer the following sequence\nwas grown: 20 nm GaAs\/1.9 ML InAs\/40 nm GaAs\/1.9 ML\nInAs\/40 nm GaAs\/50 nm n-doped GaAs\/20 nm GaAs\/4\n\u0002 \u000120 nm AlAs\/1.9 ML InAs\/20 nm AlAs\/40 nm GaAs\u0002.\nTo reduce interface roughness, the bottom AlAs barriers\nwere grown at 600 \u00b0C followed by a growth interruption\nprior to InAs deposition.\nThe X-STM measurements have been performed in an\nultrahigh-vacuum \u0001UHV\u0002 chamber with base pressure less\nthan 2\u000210\u221211 Torr on the UHV-cleaved \u0001110\u0002 cross-\nsectional surface. The photoluminescence measurements\nwere performed in an He cryostat at 7 K under cw-excitation\n\u0001\u0003=514 nm\u0002 from an Ar+ laser.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Structure\nIn Fig. 1 we show a large scale filled-states topography\nX-STM image of the cleaved structure. Three layers of QDs\nembedded in AlAs barriers and two layers of QDs grown on\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 165332 \u00012005\u0002\n1098-0121\/2005\/72\u000116\u0002\/165332\u00016\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society165332-1\nGaAs are visible in the image. Compared to the dots grown\non GaAs, the QDs embedded in AlAs barriers show a smaller\nsize and have a significantly larger density of about 3\n\u00021011 cm\u22122. This has been attributed to reduced diffusion of\nIn adatoms on the AlAs surface due to a higher surface\nroughness and the larger Al-In bond strength.5\nWhen the structure is cleaved, the cleavage surface de-\nforms to reduce the built-in strain energy of the buried quan-\ntum dot. This surface relaxation is characterized by an out-\nward displacement of the surface \u0001outward relaxation\u0002 and a\nchange in the lattice spacing in the plane of the surface.\nRegions under compressive strain bulge outward, while ten-\nsile strain depresses the surface. The outward displacement\nand change in the lattice spacing can be used to determine\nthe indium composition of the strained quantum dots by\ncomparing the experimental data with the calculated strain\nrelaxation using elasticity theory.\nBy imaging at a high voltage \u0001Vsample=\u22123 V\u0002, electronic\ncontributions to the contrast in the image are minimized and\nonly the true outward relaxation due to the lattice mismatch\n\u00017%\u0002 between the InAs and surrounding GaAs or AlAs is\nimaged.15 This is the reason why the AlAs barriers do not\nappear as dark layers.\nIn X-STM the QDs are cleaved at a random position with\nrespect to the center of the QD. However, the position of the\ncleavage plane determines which part of the QD remains\nafter cleavage and, therefore, the contribution to the outward\nrelaxation of the surface. We have imaged more than 20 QDs\nand selected the largest ones for analysis. It can then be\nassumed that these QDs are cleaved near their middle, which\nenables a consistent modeling of their size, shape, and com-\nposition.\nIn Figs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002 we compare high-voltage filled-\nstates topography images of individual InAs\/GaAs and\nInAs\/AlAs QDs, respectively. The images show the outward\nrelaxation of the cleaved QDs, which varies with the local\nindium distribution in the QDs. The outward relaxation of\nthe InAs\/GaAs dot indicates a lower indium concentration in\nthe corners of the trapezium-shaped cross section compared\nto the center, while the indium distribution in the InAs\/AlAs\ndot is more homogeneous.\nWe calculated the outward relaxation and the strain distri-\nbution of the cleaved QDs with the finite element package\nABAQUS, which is based on continuum elasticity theory.\nThe QD shape was taken to be a cleaved truncated pyramid\nwhich is consistent with the observed cross section and ear-\nlier work.16,17 The QD sizes were determined from the\nX-STM measurements while the indium distribution was\nvaried in order to get the optimal fit to the measured outward\nrelaxation. The best results were obtained by allowing the\nmodeled QDs to be cleaved at a plane 1 nm above their\ndiagonal. The diagonal base length and the height of the\nInAs\/GaAs QD is 28.4 nm and 6 nm, respectively. For the\nInAs\/AlAs QD the diagonal base length is 19 nm and the\nheight is 4.2 nm. The calculated relaxation of the cleaved\nsurface of the QDs is shown in Figs. 2\u0001c\u0002 and 2\u0001d\u0002 using the\nsame height scale as in the corresponding X-STM images,\nFigs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002.\nFigure 3 shows the measured and calculated outward re-\nlaxation profiles \u00033\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004 and lattice constant profiles\n\u00033\u0001c\u0002 and 3\u0001d\u0002\u0004 taken in the growth direction through the\ncenter of the QDs. The lattice constant profiles are derived\nfrom Figs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002 by ensemble averaging of the spac-\ning between the atomic rows of the cleaved \u0001110\u0002 surface\nmeasured as a function of distance in the growth direction.\nThe ensemble averaging was performed on lattice constant\nprofiles taken within a 2 nm region around the central axis of\nthe QDs. From the change in lattice constant, which is deter-\nmined by the strain distribution in and around the QDs, it can\nbe seen that there is compressive strain above and below the\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Filled states topography X-STM image of\nthree QD layers embedded in 40-nm-thick AlAs barriers and two\nQD layers grown in GaAs, Vsample=\u22123 V.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 165332 \u00012005\u0002\n165332-2\nQDs. For the InAs\/GaAs QD, there is a clear increase in\nlattice constant towards the top of the QD, which indicates\nan increasing indium concentration. This can also be seen by\nthe slight asymmetry in the relaxation profile of the\nInAs\/GaAs QD. From X-STM and photocurrent experi-\nments, it has been shown that low growth-rate InAs\/GaAs\nQDs have an increasing indium concentration in the growth\ndirection.17,18 However, other groups have reported InGaAs\nQDs with laterally nonuniform indium compositions show-\ning an inverted-triangle, trumpet, or truncated reversed-cone\nshape.8\u201311 We find that the indium distribution of our low-\ngrowth rate InAs\/GaAs QDs mostly resembles the trumpet\nshape proposed in Ref. 9 which we describe with a linear\ngradient in both the growth direction and lateral direction, as\nshown by the inset in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. Along the center of the QD,\nthe indium concentration x of the InxGa1\u2212xAs alloy changes\nfrom x=0.8 at the base to x=1.0 at the top of the QD. The\ngradient in the lateral direction depends on the position along\nthe growth direction. At the base of the QD, x varies linearly\nfrom 0.8 to 0.4 from the core to the perimeter, while at the\ntop of the QD it remains constant. For the InAs\/AlAs QD\nbest fit results were obtained with an indium composition\ndecreasing from x=0.85 at the base to x=0.70 at the top of\nthe QD, as shown by the inset in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002. In this case there\nis no evidence for a lateral gradient in the indium composi-\ntion.\nWe attribute the observed differences in indium composi-\ntion and size of the QDs in GaAs and AlAs to the combined\neffects of \u0001a\u0002 the reduced diffusion of In on AlAs compared\nto GaAs, \u0001b\u0002 the reduced intermixing for the InAs WL on\nAlAs, and \u0001c\u0002 the capping process. It is known that the in-\ndium accumulation in QDs is determined by strain minimi-\nzation during growth.19,20 However, the preferential indium\naggregation at the In-rich region of the dot is limited by the\nlateral diffusion of indium in the case of growth on the AlAs\nsubstrate, which results in a reduced QD size and increased\nQD density.5\nFurthermore, it has been shown21 that there is less inter-\nmixing for an InAs WL on AlAs compared to an InAs WL on\nGaAs. Together with the reduced mobility of In on AlAs, this\nexplains the homogeneous indium distribution in the base of\nthe InAs\/AlAs QDs. It has been proposed that the growth of\ndots on AlAs is initiated by 2D islands which develop into\nsmall 3D islands when more InAs is deposited.21 This is in\ncontrast to the growth of dots on GaAs where dot formation\nis initiated by small indium-rich nucleation centers which\ndevelop into trumpet-shaped indium distributions by the\npreferential diffusion of In to the apex of the dot.9 These\ngrowth mechanisms are supported by our observation of the\nindium distribution inside the dots.\nThe observed decrease of the indium concentration to-\nward the top of the InAs\/AlAs QD might be caused by the\nresidual incorporation of AlAs in the top of the dot during\nthe capping process. In order to reduce the total strain field in\nthe QD some capping material is incorporated in the top of\nthe dot. In the case of GaAs capping, the diluted part of the\ndot is very mobile and therefore disappears very quickly dur-\ning capping, causing leveling of the QDs.22 The InAs diluted\nby Al, however, is much less mobile due to the stronger\nAl-In bond strength and therefore more diluted material at\nthe top remains in place.\nFinally, the difference in the formation of QDs in AlAs\nand GaAs cannot be attributed to a different vertical indium\nsegregation process in AlAs and GaAs. An image of the ver-\ntical segregation of the wetting layer of the InAs\/AlAs dots\nstructure is shown in Fig. 4. Figure 3 shows the measured\nand calculated relaxation profiles for the segregated wetting\nlayer in AlAs \u0001e\u0002 and GaAs \u0001f\u0002. The calculated relaxation\nprofiles have been derived using the phenomenological\nmodel of Muraki et al.23 to describe the indium segregation\nprofile. We find a segregation coefficient of R=0.79\u00b10.03\nand R=0.78\u00b10.03 for GaAs and AlAs, respectively, in agree-\nment with Ref. 24. This indicates that strain rather than the\nchemical bond strength determines the vertical indium seg-\nregation.\nB. Photoluminescence\nIn the following we will show that we can calculate the\nground state photoluminescence energy from the measured\nsize, shape, and composition of the QDs. Based on our struc-\ntural analysis we have calculated the single particle bound\nelectron and hole states in both the InAs\/GaAs and\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Calculated and measured outward relax-\nation profiles through the center of the QD in the growth direction\nfor an InAs\/GaAs QD \u0001a\u0002 and an InAs\/AlAs QD \u0001b\u0002. \u0001c\u0002 and \u0001d\u0002 are\nthe corresponding calculated and measured lattice constant profiles.\n\u0001e\u0002 and \u0001f\u0002 are measured and calculated outward relaxation profiles\nof the segregated wetting layers in GaAs \u0001e\u0002 and AlAs \u0001f\u0002. The\ngrowth direction is from left to right.\nATOMIC-SCALE STRUCTURE AND\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 165332 \u00012005\u0002\n165332-3\nInAs\/AlAs QDs shown in Fig. 2. We use the electron and\nhole ground state energies to estimate the energy of the\nground state exciton and compare this to the photolumines-\ncence results shown in Fig. 5. The InAs\/GaAs dots show a\nsecond PL peak around 1.13 eV, which we attribute to a\nbimodal size distribution, since it does not disappear at low\nexcitation density, nor increase considerably at high excita-\ntion density compared to the first peak. The bimodal size\ndistribution was confirmed by atomic force microscopy mea-\nsurements on the top \u0001uncapped\u0002 layer. The broad PL spec-\ntrum of InAs\/AlAs dots has been attributed to a unimodal\ndot size distribution.14\nThe calculation of the bound electron and hole states is\nperformed with the method of Roy and Maksym25 in which\nthe single band, effective mass Hamiltonian is diagonalized\nin a basis of harmonic oscillator functions. Within this ap-\nproximation the strain dependence of the band gap is in-\ncluded exactly in the Hamiltonian, while the strain depen-\ndence of the electron and hole mass is included with\nperturbation theory.26,27 In our calculation the dot structures\nand composition variations are taken directly from our\nX-STM measurements. We linearly interpolate the band pa-\nrameters and effective masses to obtain the values relevant to\nthe InGaAs and InAlAs alloy material in the QDs.\nIt is well known that a single band calculation adequately\ndescribes the electron states and the hole ground state27 in\nInAs\/GaAs QDs. For the calculation of the electron and hole\nground state of the InAs\/GaAs QD shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, we\nused the band parameters given in Ref. 27, and converged\nthe calculated electron and hole energies to within 0.1 meV.\nWe estimate the ground state photoluminescence energy\nfrom the electron Ee and hole Ehh ground state energies as\n\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006Ee\u0006\u2212 \u0006Ehh\u0006\u221210 meV, where the 10 meV is a rough ap-\nproximation to the electron-hole interaction energy. With\nEe=1275.9 meV and Ehh=222.3 meV, we find a PL energy\nof \u0004\u0005\u00051044 meV, which corresponds to the observed PL\npeak position to within 15 meV \u0003shown by the arrow in Fig.\n5\u0001a\u0002\u0004. Since we typically look for the largest dots in the\nX-STM measurements, it is expected that the calculated PL\nenergy is at the low energy side of the observed PL peak.\nIn contrast to InAs\/GaAs QDs, the electron states in\nInAs\/AlAs QDs may be bound at the \u0001, X, or L point. We\nhave calculated the electron and heavy hole single band en-\nvelope functions using the band parameters shown in Table I.\nThe calculated electron and hole energies are converged to\nwithin 0.5 meV. The slower convergence in this type of QD,\ncompared to the InAs\/GaAs QDs, is due to the much larger\nconfinement potential.\nFrom the \u0001 bound electron \u0001Ee=2175 meV\u0002 and hole\nstates \u0001Eh=611 meV\u0002 in the InAs\/AlAs QD shown in Fig.\n2\u0001b\u0002, we estimate a ground state PL energy of \u0004\u0005\n\u00051554 meV, which corresponds to the low energy side of\nthe broad PL peak spectrum as shown by the \u201cL\u201d arrow in\nFig. 5\u0001b\u0002. As stated previously, this is to be expected since\nthe analyzed InAs\/AlAs dot is one of the largest in the\nsample, as observed by X-STM.\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Filled states topography X-STM image of\nthe InAs\/AlAs segregated wetting layer \u0001a\u0002.

The double peak from\nthe InAs\/GaAs dots \u0001a\u0002 indicates a bimodal size distribution which\nwas confirmed by atomic force microscopy measurements of the\nuncapped dot layer at the sample surface. The calculated ground\nstate PL energy is indicated by the arrow. The broad PL peak of the\nAlAs dots \u0001b\u0002 can be attributed to an ensemble of dots with varying\nsizes. The large increase in PL intensity at the low energy end of the\nspectrum is due to bandgap recombination of the GaAs substrate.\nThe arrows labeled L and S indicate the calculated ground state PL\nenergy for large and small dots as discussed in the text.\nOFFERMANS et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 165332 \u00012005\u0002\n165332-4\nThe broad PL spectrum of InAs\/AlAs dots has been at-\ntributed to a spread in dot size.14 To investigate this, we\nrepeated the calculation for smaller InAs\/AlAs QDs with the\nsame shape as the large dot and the same vertical variation in\nindium fraction from 85% to 70%. For a dot with a height of\n2.4 nm and diameter of 10.8 nm, we find that the lowest \u0001\nbound state shifts up in energy by 246 meV while the heavy\nhole ground state moves down by 120 meV. This results in a\nPL energy of \u0004\u0005\u00051920 meV, which corresponds to the high\nenergy side of the PL spectrum in Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002, as indicated by\nthe \u201cS\u201d arrow. It is difficult to determine the smallest dot size\nfrom cross-sectional images since the position of the cleav-\nage plane is unkown. The existence of InAs\/AlAs QDs as\nsmall as 8 nm in diameter has been reported in the\nliterature,14 however, if we decrease the QD diameter below\n10.8 nm we find that the lowest energy state at \u0001 moves\nabove the AlAs X band edge, and is no longer confined to the\ndot. In such small QDs, the recombination becomes both\nspatially indirect and indirect in k space, and is therefore\nexpected to give only a weak contribution to the PL.\nFor the large QD, we find that the L bound ground state is\nwell above \u0001114 meV\u0002 the \u0001 bound ground state. There is a\nlarge spread in the reported values for the position of the\nAlAs conduction band edge at X.29,32 We find that the AlAs X\nband edge may be either above or below the unstrained InAs\nX band edge. In either case, the band edge deformation po-\ntential is positive at the X point,33 and the large compressive\nstrain in the QD lowers the dot X band edge below that of the\nAlAs barrier, leading to a weakly bound state in the X valley.\nUsing the parameters shown in Table I, we find that the X\nbound electron state in the large InAs\/AlAs QD, shown in\nFig. 2\u0001b\u0002, is 74 meV above the \u0001 bound electron state. In the\nsmall InAs\/AlAs QD discussed earlier, the lowest \u0001 bound\nelectron state coincides with the AlAs X band edge and is\n123 meV above the X bound state. If we assume that the\nnormally forbidden \u0001-X transitions do contribute to the PL,\nthese transitions would only contribute in the narrow energy\nwindow between 1628 and 1796 meV. We therefore con-\nclude that the large width of the PL peak shown in Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002\nis due to \u0001-\u0001 electron-hole recombination, with the low en-\nergy side of the PL peak determined by the largest dots, such\nas the one analyzed by X-STM, and the high energy side\ndetermined by the smallest dots that contribute to the PL.\nThese could be either the smallest dots in the distribution or\nthe smallest dots that have a direct \u0001-\u0001 transition.\nIt has been suggested that QDs without a bound electron\nstate do not contribute to the PL because electrons can rap-\nidly scatter via the X states in the AlAs barrier to the sur-\nrounding GaAs matrix or to larger QDs,13 where \u0001-\u0001 transi-\ntions are allowed, as shown in Fig. 6. Repeated scattering\nwould cause the extremely long decay times \u0001microseconds\u0002\nTABLE I. Electron and hole parameters for AlAs and InAs.

We have estimated the exchange splitting\nof the small InAs\/AlAs QD discussed previously by calcu-\nlation of the electron-hole wave function overlap P\n\b\t\u0006e\u0001r\u0002\u0006h\u0001r\u0002dr.35 We find that this is 7.6 times larger than\nthat of the InAs\/GaAs QD, which will clearly lead to an\nenhancement in the exciton exchange splitting in InAs\/AlAs\nQDs.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nTo summarize, we have determined the size, shape, and\ncomposition of InAs\/GaAs QDs and InAs QDs embedded in\nan AlAs barrier, by X-STM. The outward relaxation and lat-\ntice constant of the cleaved surface of the QDs and their\nwetting layers were calculated using continuum elasticity\ntheory and compared with experimental data in order to de-\ntermine the indium concentration of the dots. Based on the\nstructural results we have calculated the electronic ground\nstates of the dots using a single band, effective mass ap-\nproach. We find that the calculated ground state photolumi-\nnescence energy of the InAs\/GaAs dots is in excellent agree-\nment with the measured energy. The observed large width of\nthe PL spectrum of InAs\/AlAs dots can be attributed to\n\u0001-\u0001 electron-hole recombination within an ensemble of dots\nwith sizes varying between 2.4\u20134.2 nm in height and\n10\u201320 nm along the base diagonal. We find that the electron-\nhole wave function overlap of small InAs\/AlAs QDs is 7.6\ntimes larger than that of InAs\/GaAs QDs grown under the\nsame conditions. This supports the explanation of the long\ndecay times in InAs\/AlAs dots by an enhanced exciton ex-\nchange splitting.\n*Electronic address: p.offermans@tue.nl\n1 J. L. Movilla, J. I.
