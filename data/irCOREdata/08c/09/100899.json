INTRODUCTION\nExperimental studies of the low energy structure of\nneutron-rich nickel isotopes provide information needed for\nthe critical evaluation of theoretical models describing the\nproperties of exotic nuclei close to 28\n78Ni50. Shell structure\nvariations in this region may also occur for various reasons,\nas argued in several theoretical papers [1\u20134]. The systematic\nexperimental data help to understand the trends of the struc-\nture changes. In particular, there has been a series of experi-\nments [5\u201314] which directly or indirectly attempted to an-\nswer the question of magicity of the 28\n68Ni40 and 28\n78Ni50 nuclei.\nAs a result of these experiments it has been established that\nalthough 68Ni indeed appears to be a doubly magic nucleus\n[5,11], the N=40 closed shell is not robust and disappears as\nsoon as the proton number changes. The existence of the 8+\nisomeric state in 78Zn [8] indicates that the N=50 closed\nshell persists. There is an agreement that a closed shell Z\n=28 is not being dramatically violated and the spherical\nshell-model calculation using a 28\n56Ni28 core can be applied for\nnuclei near 28\n68Ni40. This may create the illusion that these\nneutron-rich nuclei behave like their valence mirrors with\nN=50 (see Ref. [15]). In this paper we argue that this is not\nthe case and we show significant departure of the experimen-\ntal observations from the theoretical predictions. Since the\nobservation of the T1\/2=230s3d ns Ip=8+ isomeric state in\n70Ni [7] the similar sng9\/2dJ=8+\n2\nexcitations in more neutron-\nrich nickel nuclei such as 72,74,76Ni were sought for. All of\nthese 8+ states are predicted to be isomeric. They should\ndecay via a cascade of four stretched E2 transitions connect-\ning the 8+,6+,4+,2+,0+ levels. The yrast 8+ level should be\nlong lived because of the noncollective E2 transition [e.g.,\nBsE2d=0.693s9d W.u. for 70Ni] and the small energy differ-\nence between the 8+ and 6+ levels s,100 keVd. Such high-\nspin isomers resulting from the coupling of two identical\nnucleons in the same orbital j to a maximum allowed spin\nJ=2j\u22121 are known across the chart of nuclei near closed\nshells. This general pattern arises as a consequence of the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 68, 044304 (2003)\n0556-2813\/2003\/68(4)\/044304(6)\/$20.00 \u00a92003 The American Physical Society68 044304-1\nshort-range nucleon-nucleon residual interactions [16]. The\nsearch for 72m,74mNi has been so far unsuccessful. This paper\nin its first part will summarize quantitative results of this\nsearch, and then present the new data obtained from the b\ndecay of 72Co and try to explain the relevance of this result\nto the problem of the disappearance of the 8+ isomers. Two\ndifferent experimental approaches are described. In the first\none we attempted to observe the decay of the 8+ isomeric\nstates in 72Ni and 74Ni that are populated directly in the frag-\nmentation reaction, using the same technique as applied for\nthe discovery of 70mNi [7] and 78mZn [8]. In the second one\nwe measured excited states in 72Ni populated by b decay of\n72Co. The b decay of 70Co was treated as the test case for the\nexperimental technique as well as for the method of data\nanalysis. This experimental task was difficult because these\ncobalt isotopes are even further away from stability and thus\nmore difficult to produce than their nickel isobars. Parallel to\nthe b decay measurements the isomeric spectroscopy was\nperformed as well. The first results of that part\u2014evidence for\nisomerism in 76Ni\u2014are reported in Ref. [17]. All experi-\nments described below have been performed at the heavy ion\nfragmentation facility\u2014GANIL.\nII. SEARCH FOR AN 81 ISOMER IN 72Ni\nThe search for isomers in 72,74Ni produced directly in a\nfragmentation reaction was done with a 61.6 A MeV 76Ge30+\nbeam at an average intensity of 330 nA. The microsecond\nion-delayed g-ray correlation method was used to search for\nthe isomeric decay in each isotope [18]. The experiment was\nperformed at the LISE separator [19] which was optimized\nfor a maximum yield of 72Ni. It employed a high efficiency\nand high resolution g detection setup consisting of three\nHPGE detectors to search for an 8+ isomer. The total full-\nenergy peak efficiency was found to be 12% at 200 keV. The\nfull description of the experiment is reported in Ref. [20].\nDuring 74 h of acquisition time, a total number of 1.05\n3106 72Ni ions was implanted into the final detection setup.\nDespite such a large number of detected ions, no convincing\nevidence for the decay of the 8+ isomer could be found. In\nthe same setting, about 0.93106 ions of 70Ni were implanted\nand the decay of the known 8+ isomer was clearly observed\nyielding 9025 counts in the 183-keV g line and 1820 counts\nin the 1260-keV line. The g intensity analysis yielded the\npopulation probability F=13% for the 70mNi isomer in agree-\nment with the result reported previously [7].\nSince the 8+ state in 72Ni should be populated in the re-\naction with a similar probability as the analogous state ob-\nserved in 70Ni, we conclude that the lifetime of the state\nsearched for is either too short or too long to be identified\nwith our technique. Assuming that the decay pattern of the 8+\nstate in 72Ni is the same as in 70Ni, producing a similar\nsequence of four E2 g transitions, and that the isomeric ratio\nis equal to 13% as measured in the same conditions for\n70mNi, we can deduce the half-life limits for the unobserved\nisomer in 72Ni. To obtain the short half-life limit, the g spec-\ntrum correlated with 72Ni was produced with the condition\nthat the g ray was detected less than 100 ns after the ion\nimplantation. Such a spectrum allows us to deduce an upper\nlimit for the number of counts in the expected peaks. From\nthis the limit, T1\/2,18 ns was obtained. A similar procedure\nwas used to derive the long half-life limit, with the correla-\ntion time t=44 ms and leading to T1\/2.3.7 ms. We conclude\nthat under the above assumptions, the half life of the 8+ state\nin 72Ni is either shorter than 18 ns or longer than 3.7 ms. A\nsimilar analysis made for 3600 ions of 74Ni yielded the limits\nT1\/2,60 ns and T1\/2.0.2 ms [21]. The presented results\nshow clearly that the isomer spectroscopy in fragmentation is\nnot a viable method to measure excited levels either in 72Ni\nor in 74Ni and one has to measure them with a different\nmethod. One way is via b delayed g-ray spectroscopy.\nIII. b DECAY EXPERIMENT\nA. Experimental method\nIn the experiment focused on b decay studies the 86Kr36+\nbeam at energy of 58A MeV and the mean intensity of\n2880 nA was impinging on a rotating natTa target of 30 mm\nthickness. Behind the target a 125 mm thick carbon stripper\nwas used. The selection of the ions has been done using the\nnew LISE2000 spectrometer [22]. The average time of flight\nof the reaction products was only about 200 ns, which was\nachieved by mounting the detector setup in the first achro-\nmatic point of LISE2000 only 19 m away from the target. A\nstack of four silicon detectors was placed at the implantation\npoint. Their thickness amounted to 23300 mm, 1 mm, and\n3.5 mm. Selected ions were stopped in the third one\u2014a\ndouble sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) with 16316\nstrips of 3-mm pitch. The fourth Si (Li) detector acted as a\nveto counter for heavy ions and b particles. It detected beam\nparticles not stopped in the third detector. This silicon tele-\nscope was surrounded by four clover-type EXOGAM Ge de-\ntectors. The total photopeak efficiency measured with cali-\nbration sources was found to be 6% at 1.3 MeV and 23% at\nthe maximum around 120 keV. The energy resolution was\nfound to be 4 keV at 1.408 MeV. The b detection efficiency\nof the DSSD was determined with the 66Co decay using\nbranching ratios from Ref. [23] and was found to be about\n20%.\nThe standard method of identification, by measuring en-\nergy loss, total kinetic energy, and time-of-flight, has been\napplied for the assignment of mass A, atomic number Z, and\ncharge q of each stopped ion [24\u201326]. During the whole\nmeasurement lasting about 100 h, approximately 200 000\nheavy ions were implanted into the DSSD detector giving a\nrate of 0.03 ion per second per strip. Thus an average time\nbetween two implants is much longer than the average b\ndecay lifetime, usually of the order of 100 ms for the nuclei\nof interest. The granularity of the strip detector provided a\nclean spatial correlation between the implanted ion and its\ndetected b decay in the same strip. The average rate of the b\nparticles correlated with the g rays was 20 s\u22121. The b back-\nground events were mainly coming from the decay of long-\nlived nuclei implanted in the same strips as the selected ions.\nIn the measurement 3330 ions of 70Co and 3290 ions of 72Co\nhave been implanted. The average rate of the b delayed g\nrays correlated with the selected ions (70Co or 72Co) was\n0.02 s\u22121.\nM. SAWICKA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 68, 044304 (2003)\n044304-2\nB. b2 decay of 70Co\nThe spectrum of b delayed g of 70Co is shown in Fig. 1,\nrevealing g lines observed previously in a b decay experi-\nment performed by Mueller et al. [23]. This provided a proof\nof the correct ion identification as well as of the data analysis\ntechnique. The half life of the b delayed g rays from 70Co\nhas been determined by the least squares fitting procedure.\nThe decay time spectrum (see inset of Fig. 1) was accumu-\nlated by taking into account all events of b-g coincidences\nwhich occurred during the period 1 s after the implantation\nof the 70Co ion. During this period, not only the decay of\n70Co but also of its daughter (70Ni, T1\/2=6.0 s [27]) and\ngranddaughter (70Cu, T1\/2=4.5 s [28]) could, in principle, be\nrecorded. Such a contribution, however, was found to be\nnegligible due to long half lives of the descendant activities.\nFinally, we obtained T1\/2=110s9d ms which is compatible\nwith the half life observed for the 7\u2212 state decay in Ref. [23]\nT1\/2=120s30d ms. In addition to the strong 449-, 970-, 683-,\nand 1260-keV lines observed earlier in the b decay studies\n[23], we have identified an additional line at 916 keV. We\ntentatively place it at 3146 keV to feed the 4+ state in 70Ni at\n2230 keV. We were able to identify also the decay of the 3+\nstate in 70Co which appears to be populated weakly in this\nreaction. The relative intensity of the 608-keV line is essen-\ntially weaker than reported in Ref. [23]. We could not ob-\nserve the 1868-keV line from the decay of the second 2+\nstate in 70Ni to the ground state, identified in Ref. [23], which\nis consistent with the weak feeding of the 3+ state in 70Co see\nFig. 2 and Table I.\nC. b2 decay of 72Co\nThe b delayed g spectrum of 72Co is shown in Fig. 3\nrevealing g lines at 455, 845, 1096, and 1197 keV energy.\nBased on the intensity of these g lines (see Table II) and\nexpected similarities between the 70Co and 72Co b decays a\ntentative level scheme for 72Ni has been proposed in Fig. 4.\nThe decay has been attributed to the s6\u2212,7\u2212d state. The half\nlife has been determined in the same way as for 70Co (Sec.\nIII B). The contribution of the daughter (72Ni, T1\/2=1.5 s\n[27]) and granddaughter (70Cu, T1\/2=6.6 s [28]) activities to\nthe decay-time spectrum (see inset of Fig. 3) has been taken\ninto account. This procedure yielded T1\/2=62s3d ms. The pre-\nviously measured value is 90s20d ms [13]. We could not find\nconclusive evidence for the decay of a possible 3+ state,\nlikely because of its low population. We have attributed the\nstrongest 1096-keV line as a transition between the first ex-\ncited 2+ state in 72Ni and its 0+ ground state. The observed\nlevel scheme does not reveal clear signatures of collective\nFIG. 1. The b delayed g rays of 70Ni. In the inset, the decay\npattern of b-g activity is shown.

The previously used shell-model calculation with\nthe S3V [29] realistic interaction predicts an energy spectrum\nsimiliar to the one observed experimentally, see Fig. 4.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe limits on the half life of the 8+ isomeric state in 72Ni,\nas deduced from the isomer spectroscopy experiment (Sec.\nII), are at variance with the shell-model predictions. For ex-\nample, the calculation [30] performed according to Ref. [31]\nusing a 56Ni core and a full f5\/2, p, g9\/2 neutron shell with a\nrealistic S3V interaction from Ref. [29], adopted for the\nnickel region at N=40, predicted very small BsE2d values for\nthe 8+\u21926+ transition. This would result in isomeric lifetimes\nof the order of tens of microseconds, which is well within\nexperimental sensitivity (see Fig. 4). The expected BsE2d\nquenching is due to a mid-shell effect [32] for states with\ngood seniority n=2 in the ng9\/2 shell and can be observed,\ne.g., for the N=50 isotones in the 100Sn region, which are\ndominated by g9\/2 protons.\nFrom the obtained results it can be concluded that there is\na different hitherto not considered structure feature which\ncauses the disappearance of isomerism for these mid-shell\nnuclei. That could happen if the strong neutron g9\/2 polariz-\ning effect would result in a reduction of the Z=28 shell gap\nleading to deformation and collectivity. A recent estimate,\nhowever, results in an only marginal reduction of the proton\ngap from N=40 to 50 [33].\nThe b-delayed g-ray spectroscopy of 72Co could shed\nlight on the problem of disappearance of the 8+ isomer in\n72Ni. In particular, the observation of rotational-type struc-\ntures would suggest the onset of collectivity and provide a\nsimple explanation for the nonexistence of isomers, and\nmore importantly would be an evidence for a dramatic break-\ning of the Z=28 shell closure. There is however no evidence\nfor such rotational-like structure in the observed level se-\nquence. The intensities of the observed g rays, the analogy to\n70Ni and the high-spin parent state make it very unlikely that\nan yrast rotational sequence with J\u01426 could have escaped\nobservation. On the other hand, observation of shell-model-\ntype excitations would suggest to look for more subtle ef-\nfects within the shell-model approach. Unfortunately the 8+\nstate seems to be marginally populated in the 70Co decay and\nalso in the 72Co decay. At present the attempt can be made to\nconsistently reproduce the observed level scheme with the\nshell-model calculations and from these calculations try to\ninfer the decay properties of the 8+ level. This has been done\nby Grawe et al. [30] using empirical shell-model calculations\n(ESM) with two-body interactions derived from the 70Ni\ndata. Only the excitations involving g9\/2 neutrons have been\nallowed. For the valence mirror N=50 isotones between Z\n=40 and 50 it was shown a long time ago that the ESM\nprovides an excellent interpolation and extrapolation scheme\nwith high predictive power for level energies [34,35].

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 68, 044304 (2003)\n044304-4\nempirical two-body matrix elements (TBME) have been used\nto calculate the 72Ni level scheme, Fig. 4 (ESM). There is the\nexpected similarity of 70Ni and 72Ni in the predicted level\nschemes for S3V and ESM calculations. The striking differ-\nence is however the presence of the low lying seniority n\n=4 Jp=6+ state which is predicted to be below the seniority\nn=2 Jp=8+. This opens another deexcitation branch for the\nisomer with a larger BsE2d value of 2.7 W.u. The lifetime\npredicted by this calculation is about 10\u201320 ns, which is just\nat the limits of the experimental sensitivity. This level is\nplaced well above the Jp=8+ state by the S3V calculations. It\ncan be shown that the lowering of the n=4 Jp=6+ state is\nrelated to the lowering of the Jp=2+ excitation energies in\n70,72Ni, as the g9\/2\n2\n, 2+ TBME enters with a large weight in the\nn=4 interaction energies, which do not contain the 0+ pairing\nTBME at all [36]. This suggests that the ESM scenario is\nrelevant to explain the experimental data. The dramatic low-\nering of the 2+ energies beyond N=40, which due to the A\u22121\/3\nscalling and the missing Coulomb repulsion in the ground-\nstate should be larger than in the N=50 valence mirror iso-\ntones, awaits further clarification.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nA systematic search for the Jp=8+ isomer in 72Ni has been\nperformed. It has been concluded that the lifetime of this\nisomer, if it exists, is too short or too long to be observed\nwithin the applied experimental methods. The derived life-\ntime limits (smaller than 20 ns or larger than about 3 ms) are\nin direct contradiction with previous shell-model calculations\nwhich predict the existence of this isomer well within the\nobservation time window. The spectroscopy of b decay of\n72Co yielded for the first time information on excited levels\nin 72Ni. The spin and parity of energy levels have been sug-\ngested based on the comparison with the 70Co b decay. The\nproposed 2+ level energy of 1260 keV in 70Ni and of\n1096 keV in 72Ni are lower than predicted by the shell-model\ncalculations based on the realistic interactions, see Fig. 5. A\npossible explanation for the disappearance of 8+ isomers is\nprovided. Namely, the calculation with ESM parameters pre-\ndicts near degeneracy of the Jp=6+ state with seniority n=2\nand n=4 which can be the reason for such a disappearance of\nan 8+ isomer in 72Ni. The same mechanism as for 72Ni dis-\ncussed in this paper may be responsible for the disappear-\nance of 8+ isomerism in 74Ni. No evidence for significant\ndeformation in 72Ni was found.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful for the technical support received from\nthe staff of the GANIL facility.
