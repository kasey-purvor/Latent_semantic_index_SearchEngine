All rights reserved.Introduction\nPerception and performance of action are closely entwined neural\nprocesses. For example, speed of action initiation can be facilitated by\nthe concurrent viewing of a congruent action, or can be inhibited if an\nincongruent action is observed at the same time as performance\n(Brass et al., 2001; Brass et al., 2000; Craighero et al., 2002; Press, et al.,\n2005; Vogt et al., 2003). More complex aspects of action performance\nare also in\ufb02uenced by simultaneous observation of a matching or\nmismatching action. Kilner et al. (2003) showed that performance of\nhorizontal or vertical arm movement is in\ufb02uenced by the simulta-\nneous observation of someone moving their arm in the perpendicular\nplane, hereafter termed \u2018movement interference\u2019. An individual\nobserving someone else performing a vertical arm movement will\nperform horizontal arm movements that have a stronger vertical\ncomponent than if the observed action was also horizontal \u2014 i.e.,congruent with the performed action (Kilner et al., 2003); see also\nBouquet et al. (2007), Gowen et al. (2008) and Stanley et al. (2007)).\nKilner et al. (2003; see also Blakemore and Frith (2005)) suggested\nthat their interference effect was because observed and performed\nactions lead to coactivation of premotor areas resulting in a motor\noutput that blended the two action pro\ufb01les. This hypothesis was\nbased on the existence of neural networks involved in both\nperformance and observation processes, now known as \u201cmirror\nneurons\u201d, in area F5 of the monkey brain. This region (considered\nanalogous to the ventral premotor cortex or BA 44 in the human brain\n(Binkofski and Buccino, 2004)) is activated both during the perfor-\nmance of an action as well as during passive viewing of the same\naction (Rizzolatti et al., 1996; see Rizzolatti and Craighero (2004), for\na comprehensive review). Subsequent experiments in humans using\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have provided support to the\nhypothesis that passive perception of action involves the ventral\npremotor cortex and inferior parietal lobe (IPL) that were predom-\ninantly thought to be responsible for action\/motor performance\n(Buccino et al., 2004; Grezes and Decety, 2001; Iacoboni et al., 1999;\nIacoboni, 2005).\nPrevious studies highlight behavioural and neural differences when\nobserving human compared with non-biological stimuli. For example,\n390 J. Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400facilitation of movement initiation is less prominent when observing\nmoving robots ormechanical objects (Brass et al., 2001; Craighero et al.,\n2002; Jonas et al., 2007; Press et al., 2005; Tsai and Brass, 2007). Mirror\nneuron activity also appears to be stronger when stimuli possess a\nhuman rather thanarti\ufb01cial form (Chaminade et al., 2007; Rizzolatti and\nCraighero, 2004), and activation of mirror neuron areas in parietal and\npremotor cortex is reduced during observation of robotic or virtual-\nreality limb movements, compared to viewing a person (Engel et al.,\n2008a; Perani et al., 2001; Tai et al., 2004; although see (Oberman et al.,\n2008). Activity within the superior temporal sulcus (STS), which\nresponds speci\ufb01cally to observation of human action (Grezes and\nDecety, 2001; Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2000; Ruby and Decety, 2001;\nSenior et al., 2000) is likewise enhanced for viewing real as opposed to\ncartoon people in videos with identical kinematics (Mar et al., 2007).\nMost of these studies have used unambiguous stimuli \u2013 clearly\nidenti\ufb01ed as either human or non-human movement \u2013 to study\nbehavioural and neural effects of observing movement. However, it is\nunclear to what degree these effects are in\ufb02uenced by the underlying\nhuman movement kinematics or the declarative knowledge that a\nhuman agent is performing the task. The current experiment aimed to\ninvestigate the neural mechanisms of how belief or knowledge about\nthe agency of an observed action can in\ufb02uence the perception of such a\nstimulus. This question can be reductively phrased as that of bottom-up\nversus top-down processes \u2014 in other words, do the underlying\nkinematic properties of people acting lead us to perceive a person\nmoving, or does the knowledge that we are watching a person prepare\nour brain to use systems like the mirror neuron system to understand\nwhat we see? One candidate brain area that may be important for top-\ndown control is the paracingulate cortex. This area is preferentially\nactive during interactions with or observation of human compared to\nnon-biological stimuli. For example, greater activation occurs when\npredicting human as compared to computer actions (Ramnani and\nMiall, 2003) or playing strategic games against human compared to\ncomputer agents (Gallagher et al., 2002; McCabe et al., 2001). These\nstudies suggest that the paracingulate cortex plays a role in preferen-\ntially processing human actions or responses, particularly during tasks\nthat explicitly cue participants to the human nature of the behaviour.\nBehavioural studies of movement interference have explored the\nrelative contribution of top-down and bottom-up processes using non-\nbiological or ambiguous stimuli. For example, Kilner et al. (2003) showed\nthat viewinga robotic armproducesno interference effect for aperformed\naction, in contrast to the effect seen when viewing an actual person\nperform an action. This differential effect may be due to differences in\nkinematic pro\ufb01le between these two conditions (principally smoothness\nof acceleration) or due to the presence\/absence of a human performer\nadding agency to the observed action. Using a more humanoid robot\ninstead of a robotic arm, Oztop et al. (2004) did observe an interference\neffect implying that the robot and human movement were close enough\nfor participants to adopt similar processing strategies for both. Kilner et al.\n(2007) have since shown that both agency and motion pro\ufb01le impact\nupon interference effects.\nOur own work suggests that top-down processes regarding action\nagency play a major part in the interference effect for an ambiguous\nstimulus\u2014 a moving dot projected onto a screen. In a paradigm adapted\nfrom Kilner et al.'s (2003) study, participants who were told that the dot\nwas a recording of human movement showed a signi\ufb01cant interference\neffect on performedmovements,while another group of participantswho\nwere told that the identical dot movement was computer generated\nshowed no such effect (Gowen et al., 2008; Stanley et al., 2007). These\nresults suggest that the interference effect reported in the above studies is\nstrongly dependent on beliefs or instructions about the agency of the\nobserved action, especially in situations where the visual stimulus is\nambiguous.\nThe present experimentwas designed to answerhow instructions or\nbeliefs regarding agency in\ufb02uence perception of action, and also to\nidentify the corresponding brain areas involved. We employed a rangeof point-light movement animations together with categorical instruc-\ntions to in\ufb02uence beliefs regarding the movement type. Point-light\nanimations typically consist of a sequence of moving dots, representing\nseveral cardinal joints on an actor's body during the performance of an\naction (e.g., walking). Viewing these kinematic recordings is enough to\nnot only evoke subjective perception of human movement (Johansson,\n1973; see Blake and Shiffrar (2007), for a review) but also to activate\nneural areas such as the STS and temporal and occipital cortex that are\nactivated during the observation of \u201creal\u201d movement (Bonda et al.,\n1996; Grossman et al., 2000; Puce and Perrett, 2003). Manipulating the\nspatio-temporal relationship between the dots (in essence, scrambling\nthe presented stimulus) reduces both subjective perception of human\nmovement as well as neural activity in the STS (Bonda et al., 1996;\nGrossman et al., 2000). In the current experiment, the point-light\nanimations ranged from those that strongly resembled a personmoving\nto scrambled forms that had little resemblance to a human action and\nparticipants were asked to judge whether they perceived the stimuli as\ncontaining human movement. To in\ufb02uence beliefs about agency,\nparticipants were informed that some stimuli were based on actual\nrecordings of humanmovement, whereas other stimuli were computer\ngenerated patterns of dot movement trials.\nA pilot study (see Supplementary material I), con\ufb01rmed that both\nthe level of visual scrambling and the human\/computer category\napplied to a particular animation would in\ufb02uence subjective respond-\ning,with higher likelihoodof responding \u201chuman-like\u201d for trials labelled\nhuman, and for trials that were towards the less-scrambled end of the\nspectrum. The aim of the fMRI experimentwas to investigate the neural\nsubstrates of this phenomenon: we hypothesised that if cortical areas\nsuch as the paracingulate cortex are implicated in determination of\nagency theywouldbedifferentially activated (withgreater BOLDsignal)\nduring trials where the participant was told the stimulus was a\nrecording of a person moving. Areas dedicated to the perception of\nhuman movement such as ventral premotor cortex, IPL, and STS might\nalso show greater activation in the \u201chuman instruction\u201d condition. Such\n\ufb01ndings would indicate that prior knowledge regarding the agency of a\nstimulus can primebrain areas to process stimuli in amanner consistent\nwith the agency of movement.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\nThe participants were 14 (7 female) healthy undergraduate and\npostgraduate students at the University of Birmingham, U.K. Mean age\nwas 20.5 years (median 19, range 18 to 29). All participants were\nright-handed, and had either normal visual acuity or used appropriate\ncorrective lenses in the scanner. On completion of the study each\nparticipant received either \u00a325 or credit towards a Department of\nPsychology research participation scheme. Each participant gave\nwritten informed consent and the study was approved by a local\nresearch ethics committee.\nStimulus materials\nAnimations were created speci\ufb01cally for use in this experiment, and\nsix movements were selected: walking, kicking a ball, throwing a ball,\nthrowing a ball underarm, punching, and lifting a small box (a further\ntwomovements, including a simulated tennis shot and stepping onto a\nsmall platform were used as stimuli in the training section of the\nexperiment but never presented in the main experiment).\nThe animations were created by recording the actions using a\nVicon passive-sensor system (Oxford Metrics Vicon 250) with a six\ncamera setup. Fifteen sensors were attached to the model's body, and\nposition information was recorded at 120 Hz. From these recordings,\ntwo-second segments of movement were selected that included clear\nviews of all sensors.\n391J. Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400Position information for these movements was processed using\nMatlab v. 7 (R14, Mathworks Natick, Massachusetts). Movements\nwere converted into 2d space\u2014 this included de-trending the position\ninformation in the anterior\u2013posterior axis of movement, so that\nactions that included gross whole body translation (running, walking,\nand kicking a ball) appeared as though the actor was moving \u201con the\nspot\u201d. Position information was then \ufb01ltered with a 10 Hz low-pass\nButterworth \ufb01lter, and resampled to 60 Hz (to match the frame rate\non the projector used), and all sensor coordinates were translated to\nposition relative to the sensor at the middle of the actor's waist. These\ndata served as the \u201csource action \ufb01les\u201d.\nIn order to create the stimuli used in the experiment, these source\nmovement \ufb01les were then altered to create a \u201crandom starting position\n\ufb01le\u201d. Firstly, a randomization algorithm (conducted in Matlab)\nrandomly allocated a new starting position for each sensor. Possible\nstarting positionswere limited by a rectangular prism in 3d space based\non the axes of the actor's body when at rest. These positions were\ngenerated once for each movement, and are hereafter called the\n\u201crandom starting position movement \ufb01les\u201d. The translation of each\nsensor during the actionwas therefore identical to the source action, but\nthese translations were now relative to the new starting position.\nStimuli were then generated from these two sets of \ufb01les: position of\neach dot sensor in the visual display was a weighted average of the\nCartesian coordinates of that sensor in the sourcemovement\ufb01le and the\nrandom starting position \ufb01le. These stimuli are described hereafter by\ntheweightingproportion of theoriginalmovement in the\ufb01nal stimulus:\nfor example, a 1.0 stimulus would be the actual source movement\nstimulus, and a 0.0 stimulus would consist of the random starting\nposition stimulus. A 0.5 stimulus had sensor starting positions thatwere\npresented at themean of the starting position in the source and random\n\ufb01les. Six different weighted proportions of the original recording were\nused3: 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, and 0.85, chosen to represent a range\nof animations that varied from generally uninterpretable patterns of dot\nmovement (at the lower weighting) to appearing like realistic human\nmovement (at the higher weighting proportions).\nOver the course of all the blocks of the main task, each stimulus\nwas presented from one of three viewing angles, calculated prior to\nconverting the stimuli to a 2d model (\u221245\u00b0, 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0). Each movement\nwas therefore viewed a total of 36 times: three angles in six different\npossible mixes of original\/random starting position, and with two\ncategories (human or computer).Behavioural task\nThe behavioural task completed by the participants while in the\nscanner consisted of rating whether the point-light animations looked\nlike human movement or like random moving dots. The task\ninstructions (see Supplementary material II) told the participant that\nhe or shewould be viewing two types of animations, both featuring a set\nof moving dots: the \ufb01rst type of animation consisting of recordings of\nhuman movement, and the second type consisting of a computer\ngenerated random movement. Stimuli were categorised as either\n\u2018human movement\u2019 or \u2018computer generated\u2019: in fact, stimuli were\nidentical in both of these conditions (see Trial organization for details of\ntrial order randomization). The participant was required to rate\nagreement between the agency category and his or her perception of\nthe animation. Task descriptions emphasized the subjective nature of\nthe participant's perception of the stimuli. On each trial, therewere four\npossible responses as to whether the participant's perception agreed\nwith the category\u2014 strongly agree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, and\nstrongly disagree. For the purposes of analysing the behavioural data,\nthese responses were simpli\ufb01ed into binary agree\/disagree categories.3 The proportions chosen were based on a behavioural pilot study performed with\n15 participants (see Supplementary data I).Trial organization\nFor the event-related trial order for the main task, several\nparameters were kept in place while determining run structure and\ntrial order. Firstly, no two stimuli of the same type were ever\npresented in the same run. Secondly, within a run no two trials of the\nsame movement pattern (e.g. running, and kicking a ball) were\npresented in a row. No more than 2 trials of the same category\n(human or computer) could be presented in a row, and no more than\n2 trials of the same realism level (e.g. 0.35 proportion of original\nmovement in displayed animation) could be presented in a row.\nA single trial consisted of the following components:\n1) An inter-trial interval (ITI) of between 3 and 5 s, duringwhich only\na central \ufb01xation point was presented onscreen.\n2) Presentation of a single letter indicating trial category (H for a\nhuman-labelled trial, C for a computer labelled trial) for a semi-\nrandom duration of between 3 and 5 s. The durations of the inter-\ntrial interval and pre-trial category were determined so that the\nonset of the actual animation was jittered relative to the start of\nfMRI volume collection.\n3) The trial category cue remained onscreen during presentation of\nthemain animation. The participant was asked to \ufb01xate on this cue\nduring the trial, in order to prevent large scale eye movements\nduring the presentation of the animation. Animation duration was\nalways 2 s.\n4) Following presentation of the main animation, the trial category\nremained onscreen for between 0.75 and 1.25 s. Participants were\ninstructed to \ufb01xate during this period and to withhold any\nresponse.\n5) Following this delay, a rating screen reminder was displayed for a\nduration of 2 s. This screen consisted of a reminder of the function\nof the four button response device, and consisted of the following\nsymbols spaced from left to right \u201c\u2212\u2212\u201d, \u201c\u2212\u201d, \u201c+\u201d, and \u201c++\u201d.\nParticipants were instructed to press the button corresponding to\ntheir perception of the stimulus (relative to the given category)\nonce this screen appeared.\n6) Start of next trial sequence begins with ITI (step 1).\nExperimental procedure\nEach participant completed the experiment over two days: on one\nday, the participant completed the main task, while on the second day\nhe or she completed a localizer task as well as a structural scan. Session\norder was counterbalanced between subjects (half completed the main\nexperiment \ufb01rst, then localizer\/structural; the other half completed the\nlocalizer\/structural \ufb01rst, and then the main experiment).\nPrior to performing the main experiment, each participant\ncompleted a set of practice trials to familiarize him or her with the\ntrial structure and required responses. During this period the\nexperimenter corrected the participant's responses if necessary (by\nasking whether the participant's button press corresponded to his\/\nher intended response regarding agreement\/disagreement), and\nanswered other questions where possible. To prevent excess\nfamiliarity with the animations, the two point-light animations used\nfor these practice trials were not used in the main experiment.\nThe localizer task consisted of viewing a series of short point-light\nanimations in quick succession. A total of ten animations were\npresented, each lasting for 0.55 s: point-light animations of walking,\nrunning, boxing, jumping, and marching, and scrambled (with respect\nto each dot's starting position) versions of these \ufb01ve stimuli. The\nparticipant had to respond with a single button press if the animation\nthey had just viewed was identical to the previous animation. No\nresponse was required in the case of mismatches. Animations were\norganized into 20 second blocks: the human movement blocks and\nscrambled blocks contained six animations in a row (with a 0.55 second\n392 J. Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400ITI between each animation, where responses were required for\nmatching animations), while the baseline blocks consisted of 20 s of\n\ufb01xation. Each participant completed two runs of trials, each lasting for\n315 s. This task and set of stimuli has been used previously for the\npurposes of localizing neural areas involved in the perception of human\naction (Grossman and Blake, 2002).\nEach run of the localizer task consisted of 7 sets of humanmovement\n(six animations in each set), 7 sets of scrambled movement (six\nanimations in each set), and 5 sets of \ufb01xation (18 second duration, that\nis 3 TR, to serve as baseline).\nScanner details\nThe fMRI sessionswereconductedusingaPhilips3 TMRI scannerwith\nSENSE headcoil. Participants viewed the stimuli on a back-projected\nscreen located at the rear of the scanner core. For the functional scanning\nsessions (including the localizer), volumeswere takenwith a voxel size of\n2.5\u00d73\u00d73mm. The main task session was divided into six runs, each\nconsisting of 150 volumes (with a TR of 3 s), giving a duration of 7.5 min\nper run. Prior to the start of the run the fMRI scanner took 15 s\n(5 volumes) to achieve T2 equilibrium\/saturation. Each run contained 3\nstimuli from each stimulus realism\/agency category, making for a total of\n36 stimuli presented in a single run. The experiment was set up on an\nevent-related schedule (as opposed to a block design), so that trials from\neach condition were interspersed with one another throughout each run.\nThe localizer task sessions were performed using the same voxel\ndimensions and TR as the main task: two runs of trials were\npresented, each lasting for 105 volumes (a duration of 5 min 15 s\nper run). A high resolution structural scan was taken in the same\nsession, following the localizer task, with a resolution of 1\u00d71\u00d71 mm.\nfMRI signal processing and data analysis\nData were analysed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL)\npackage (FSL v. 3.3, FMRIB, Oxford University; for details seeWoolrich\net al. (2009) http:\/\/www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk\/fsl\/). Prior to analysis, a\nslice-timing correctionwas applied to the functional data, which were\nthen motion corrected using the MCFLIRT algorithm in FSL (Jenkinson\nand Smith, 2001). Data analysis was broken into three levels. At level\n1, analysis was completed for each recording run. Individual trial\ntimings from the Presentation log\ufb01les were \ufb01t to the functional data in\norder to calculate trial onset relative to scanner volume onset. The\nmodel at level one consisted of onset and duration of the animation\nstimuli, grouped by agency category (2 levels) and stimulus realism (6\nlevels)\u2014 no distinctionwasmade between the different actions or the\ndifferent perspective angles. All other phases of the trials were\nunmodelled (baseline or rest). Motion correction parameters (derived\nfrom MCFLIRT) were also included in the model as covariates of no\ninterest. Functional data were registered to a Montreal Neurologic\nInstitute (MNI) standard brain image. Contrasts were calculated\nlooking at the main effect of stimulus category (human or computer\ncategory trial), and main linear effect of stimulus realism (here using\nthe more detailed categories of 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75 and 0.85\nproportions of the original movement locations). Positive and\nnegative interaction terms between these two factors were also\ncalculated: these interactions can be considered as testing for areas\nmore active when stimulus and label were congruent (higher realism\nwith human label, or lower realismwith computer label) in the case of\nthe positive interaction, and for areas that are more active when\nstimulus and label were incongruent (higher realism with computer\nlabel, or lower realism with human label) in the case of the negative\ninteraction.\nLevel2of the functional analysis involveda\ufb01xed-effects combination\nof runs for each participant, providing a participant-by-participant\naverage of the Level 1 contrasts. The output of this level was then used\nas the basis for the third level of analysis, where results were combinedusing FLAME level 3 analysiswithinFEAT(Beckmannet al., 2003),which\nin effect combines responses across participants using random-effects\nmodelling.Thecontrastsfromthis\ufb01nalmodelwerethresholdedatZN2.3,\nwith an adjusted cluster threshold of pb .05.\nIn order to describe the neural activations discovered by the\nprincipal data analysis, clusters of signi\ufb01cant activity found from the\ngroup analysis werematched anatomically using comparisons between\nthe 3dmrx (MRIcro) voxel categorised Brodmann atlas, an atlas for\ngeneral neuroanatomical reference (Duvernoy et al., 1999) and one for\nlocalisation within the cerebellum (Schmahmann and Toga, 2000). In\norder to identify regions of interest such as the inferior parietal area,\nparacingulate cortex and ventral premotor cortex considered a priori to\nbe likely to show differences in activity between the agency category\nand stimulus realism categories, clusters of signi\ufb01cant activity were\ncompared to reported activation coordinates for these regions (Engel\net al., 2008a,b;Grezes et al., 2003; Perani et al., 2001;Ramnani andMiall,\n2003; Tavares et al., 2008). From the group average signal, localmaxima\nwithin these areas were compared across the 6 different stimulus\nrealism categories for computer and human instruction using the\nFeatquery tool (FMRIB, Oxford; see the FSL website for details: http:\/\/\nwww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk\/fsl\/feat5\/featquery.html).\nA mask for each region of interest was created for each participant.\nThe mask area was based on the 3dmrx Brodmann map transformed\nto the subject-speci\ufb01c structural image, with all voxels within the\ncluster selected that fell within the anatomically de\ufb01ned region. Using\nFeatquery (an FSL tool) this anatomically de\ufb01ned cluster mask was\nthen applied to extract the mean activation for the subject-speci\ufb01c\nfunctional data, representing the % change in BOLD signal during each\ntask period, relative to the mean signal intensity in that area during\nthe unmodelled baseline period (rest). As this unmodelled period\nincludes visual and response components (jittered relative to the\nonset of the point-light stimuli), the exact meaning of \u201czero\u201d\npercentage change in these descriptive analyses should be considered\narbitrary \u2014 the important elements are the relative differences\nbetween stimuli categories.Analysis of localizer task\nAnalysis of the localizer dataset was performed using FSL using a\nblock design. Slice-timing correction and motion correction were\nperformed on data from individual runs prior to analysis. FSL analysis\nwas performed over three levels. At the \ufb01rst level, the human and\nscrambledmovement blocks weremodelled, with the \ufb01xation periods\nserving as baseline periods. Contrasts were then calculated comparing\nthe human and scrambled movement blocks. The second level\ncombined the two runs for each participant, using a \ufb01xed-effects\nanalysis. Thresholds for activation were set at ZN2.3, cluster pb .05.\nThis threshold map was used to create region of interest (ROI) masks\nfor the region of the superior temporal sulcus (STS): the group-wise\nactivations in this task were also calculated by combining each\nparticipant's level 2 Feat analyses, using full Flamemodelling in FSL to\ncalculate overall activations across all participants.\nThe localizer task provided the basis for making participant-\nspeci\ufb01c ROI masks for the STS. The analysis of the localizer task\nproduced a single contrast of interest for each individual for areas\nshowing greater activity during humanmovement blocks than during\nscrambled movement blocks. Using these contrasts, two observers\n(authors EG and JS) described ROIs for each participant for signi\ufb01cant\nclusters of activity in the right STS. These ROIs weremanually checked\nfor agreement, and then added to form one STS ROI for each\nparticipant. Where agreement was poor between these two observers\n(a total of 3 participants), a third observer (RCM) created a ROI, and of\nthe three ROIs created, the two closest in agreement were combined.\nThese ROI were used to look at activity in the right hemisphere STS for\nthe main task.\nTable 1\nMean percentage of trials (with 95% con\ufb01dence intervals) rated as \u201chuman\u201d by trial\nlabel (computer or human), and stimulus realism level (low, moderate, high).\nFactor Level of\nfactor\nMean percentage rated as \u201cyes, looks\nlike a person moving\u201d\n95% con\ufb01dence\ninterval\nLabel Computer 49.6 38.4 to 60.9\nHuman 57.7 46.5 to 68.1\nStimulus\nrealism level\nLow 19.5 12.4 to 29.4\nModerate 48.6 39.1 to 58.2\nHigh 87.2 82.1 to 91\n393J. Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400Statistical analysis of behavioural data\nBehavioural data were transformed prior to analysis. To simplify\nanalysis (and increase power), response data were collapsed into\nthree categories of stimulus realism: low realism (0.35 and 0.45\nstimuli); medium realism (0.55 and 0.65 stimuli); and high realism\n(0.75 and 0.85 stimuli). Responses were then binarised into \u201cagree\u201d\/\n\u201ddisagree\u201d categories from the four original button codes (strongly\nagree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, and strongly disagree).\nAgreement score code was inverted for the \u201cComputer\u201d category\ntrials so that all proportions reported are now percentage of trials\nwhere participant rated the stimulus as looking more like a person\nmoving than a random collection of moving dots.\nTheseproportionaldatawere then logit-transformed\u2013 ln\np\n1\u2212p\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u2013\nto make them more suitable for analysis using general linear model\ntechniques (for a general discussion of the logit transformation in the\ncontext of signal detection, seeDeCarlo (1998)).Datawere\ufb01t into a two-\nway repeated-measures ANOVA, with Category as one factor (human or\ncomputer category stimulus), and stimulus realism as the second factor\n(low,medium, andhigh human realism stimuli). Signi\ufb01cantmain effects\nand interactions were followed up with paired t-tests as appropriate.4\nAverages across participants were converted back to the original\nproportion scale for graphical presentation: con\ufb01dence intervals were\ncalculated on the logit-transformed data, and againwere converted back\nto the proportion scale for graphical presentation.\nResults\nBehavioural results\nThe repeated-measures ANOVA of the logit-transformed response\ndata indicated a non signi\ufb01cant trend for Category, F(1,13)=3.51,\np=.084.

The localiser task con\ufb01rmed that, across the entire study\ngroup, right hemisphere STS activation was enhanced during the\nnormal animations compared to the scrambled animations (see\nSupplementary material III). These results allowed us to identify any\nareas of STS activity in the following contrasts.\nMain linear effect of stimulus realism. Asexpected,brainareaspreviously\nassociatedwithbiologicalmotionincreasedinactivityasstimulusrealism\nincreased across the 6 levels including right and left primary and\nextrastriate visual cortices (BA 17, BA 19 and right BA 18), right and left\nfusiform gyri (BA 37) and left cerebellar lobule VI (Table 2). Right STS\nactivitywas also present at a lower signi\ufb01cance value of Z=2.9, (x=46;\ny=\u221230; z=2). The only area that displayed increased activity with\ndecreasing stimulus realismwas right primary visual cortex (Table 3).\nEffect of instruction. The comparison between the human and\ncomputer instructions revealed different activation patterns for each\ncondition. The human instruction category resulted in greater\nactivation in right and left visual cortices (BA 17 and 18), left medial\ntemporal areas such as the parahippocampus (BA 36) and hippocam-\npus (BA 20), the left amygdala and left insula cortex and Rolandic\noperculum (BA 48) (Fig 2a). In addition, the right dorsal and ventral\nparacingulate cortex (BA 10 and 32) and orbital gyrus (BA 11) were\nalso more active than in the computer instruction trials (Fig 2b).\nHowever, contrary to our predictions, increased STS and ventral\npremotor cortex activity was not apparent in this contrast. These\nresults are summarised in Table 4.\nThe computer instruction was associated with highly signi\ufb01cant\nactivation in right and left ventral prefrontal cortices (BA 44, 45 and 47),\nleft DLPFC (BA 46), and left and right inferior and superior parietal lobes\n(BA 7 and 39) (Fig 2c). In addition, right cerebellum (crus 1 and lobule\nVIIIA) and areas of the left inferior temporal gyrus (BA 20 and 37),\nmiddle temporal gyrus (BA 21) and lingual gyrus (BA 37) were more\nactive for this category.

Additional areas included the right superior temporal\nlobe (BA 22), leftmiddle temporal gyrus (BA 37), right insula cortex (BA\n48) and left superior parietal lobe (BA 7). Right STS activity was also\npresent when instruction and stimuli were congruent, at a signi\ufb01cance\nlevel of Z=2.73 (x=52, y=\u221242, z=14).\nRegion of interest analysis. We examined how regions of interests\nidenti\ufb01ed from the above contrasts varied in activity over the different\nlevels of stimulus realism and instruction using Featquery (see\nMaterials and methods). To simplify data presentation, stimulus\nrealism was collapsed into low, medium and high as with the\nbehavioural data. Percentage change indicates change relative to the\nmean level of unmodelled baseline (rest) activity.\nIn regards to the two regions of the paracingulate cortex that were\nidenti\ufb01ed, BA10activitywasgreater for thehuman instruction across all\nconditions (Fig. 4a) whereas activity in the more dorsal and posterior\nparacingulate location (BA32)differed according to stimulus reality and\ninstruction: activity increased and decreased for the computer and\nhuman instructions respectively as stimulus realism increased (Fig. 4b).\nTherefore, the paracingulate cortex appears to respond both to the\ninstructedagency(BA10and32)andtowhetherthereiscon\ufb02ictbetween\ninstruction and stimuli characteristics (BA 32).\nA similar pattern of activation toBA32wasobserved in thepre-SMA,\nrevealinghigheractivitywheninstructionsandstimuliwereinconsistent\n(Fig. 5a). The SMA proper demonstrated a reverse pattern with greater\nactivity when instructions and stimuli were consistent (Fig. 5b). BA 44\ndisplayed greater activation for computer compared with human\ninstruction (Fig. 6a). Both parietal areas (BA 7 and BA 39) were more\nactive for computer instructionsbut also for inconsistent instruction and\nstimuli conditions (Figs. 6b\u2013c).\nDiscussion\nThe results clearly show that pre-cueing participants that point-\nlight stimuli were either human or computer generated movementsTable 3\nBrain areas correlated with decreasing stimulus realism.\nMotion content: negative correlation Coordinates\n(mm)\nArea Cluster volume\n(mm3)\nCluster\nP\nZ Laterality x y z\nPrimary visual cortex\n(BA 17)\n8063 0.05 6.33 R 14 \u221298 10in\ufb02uences both behavioural and neural responses to these stimuli.\nThese conclusions can be summarised as three main \ufb01ndings: (1)\nhuman instruction had greater in\ufb02uence on behavioural responses for\nlow realism trials, (2) computer and human instructions resulted in\ndifferent patterns of brain activation and (3) two distinct areas of the\nparacingulate cortex responded to human instruction.\nBehavioural \ufb01ndings\nAs expected, the proportion of trials rated as \u201chuman\u201d increased\nwith increasing stimulus reality, showing that the objective quality of\nthe stimuli in\ufb02uences perceptual judgments. It appears that the\nhuman instruction had a larger effect on responding at the low\nstimulus reality levels, with participants rating more low reality trials\nas human if accompanied by a human instruction. Pilot data (with a\nsample size of 15) had suggested that the categorising phenomenon\nwould be consistent across all stimulus realism levels (i.e., the\ninteraction was not signi\ufb01cant): that is, there was a main effect of\ncategory (trials more likely to be rated as a person moving if\ncategorised \u201chuman\u201d) and a main effect of stimulus realism (more\nlikely to be rated as a person moving at higher stimulus realism\nlevels). It is not clear why the pattern of results differed slightly in the\nfMRI task: this might re\ufb02ect the dif\ufb01culty of decision making in the\nunusual fMRI environment.\nInstruction affects brain responses to identical stimuli\nHuman and computer instruction resulted in differential activation\nof brain networks, even though the visual stimuli were identical across\nboth instruction categories. The human instruction condition resulted in\ngreater activation of paracingulate cortex, medial temporal cortex, as\nwell as primary and extrastriate visual cortex, whereas the computer\ninstructionwas associatedwith greater activity in the ventral and dorsal\nprefrontal cortex, the inferior and superior parietal lobes and inferior\nandmiddle temporal gyri. Our results are in agreementwithMartin and\nWeisberg (2003) who observed that interpreting identical abstract\nshapes as either social ormechanical events produced different patterns\nof brain activation. Interpreting shape movement as \u201csocial\u201d also\nresulted in activation in the amygdala and ventral medial prefrontal\ncortex, and the authors suggested that these areas play a role in\ninterpreting the social stimuli. Adding to this suggestion, the activation\nseen in the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and para-\nhippocampal regions during the human instruction trials in our work\nmaybedue tovisual recognition processes,with participants comparing\nthe point-light images with stored memories of human movement in\norder to interpret the human related stimuli. These areas play a role in\nmemory processes (Petrides, 2007), and amygdala and orbitofrontal\ncortex activation has been reported in point-light tasks where\nparticipants were asked to memorise the sequences (Bonda et al.,\n1996). However, in the case of low stimulus realism, the point-light\nstimuli would not have closely matched memories of human move-\nment, leading to activation in the prefrontal cortex, pre-SMA and dorsal\nFig. 2.

Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400paracingulate cortexwhichmay formanetwork for the interpretation of\nmore ambiguous or contradictory movement stimuli. Activation of the\npre-SMA has been reported when participants are required to imagine\nwalking (Malouin et al., 2003) and it is possible that in the case of\ncon\ufb02ict between human instruction and stimuli, participants may have\ninternally simulated the observed movements in an attempt to\nunderstand their structure. Indeed, if as recently suggested that the\npre-SMA is involved in processing errors between different sensory\nmodalities (Yomogida et al., 2010), onewould expect the pre-SMA to be\nmore active during the con\ufb02ict trials where there would be a mismatch\nbetween output from the internal simulation and the observed\nmovement.\nThe brain areas more strongly activated for the computer instruction\ncoincide with those reported during observation of objects and arti\ufb01cial\nmotion. Observing point-light toolmotion produces greater activity in the\nmiddle temporal gyrus andmedial fusiform areas, compared to observing\npoint-light human motion (Beauchamp et al., 2003); likewise, forming\nsemantic judgments about inanimate objects leads to activation of the\nmiddle and inferior temporal gyri (Chao et al., 1999; see Puce and Perrett\n(2003) for a review). Beauchamp et al. (2003) suggested that these areas\npreferentially process arti\ufb01cial motion and, consistentwith their \ufb01ndings,\nour temporal area activation was exclusively located within the lefthemishpere. During a paradigm where participants rated whether\ncomputer animated characters were moving in a biological or arti\ufb01cial\nmanner, Chaminade et al. (2007) observed that trials rated as arti\ufb01cial\nwere associated with greater activity in the ventral premotor and\nposterior parietal cortices than trials rated as biological. Such frontal and\nposterior parietal areasmaybeparticularly important for analysing spatial\nand kinematic visual sequences as Tavares et al. (2008) observed greater\nactivity in these areas when participants paid attention to the spatial and\nkinematics properties rather than the behavioural interactions of two\nmoving shapes. In addition, observation of non-biological motion and\nobjects frequently activates prefrontal cortex areas, possibly due to\nprediction of forthcoming events in a sequence (Chaminade et al., 2001;\nSchubotz and von Cramon, 2003, 2004;Wolfensteller et al., 2007). As the\nsuperior parietal cortex, precuneus and prefrontal regions are associated\nwith attentive tracking of moving objects (Culham et al., 1998) it is also\npossible that the activity in these areas may re\ufb02ect greater cognitive\ndemand formaking judgments in a taskwhen a stimulus is considered to\nbe of arti\ufb01cial rather than biological origin. We propose that activation\nduring the computer instruction trials supports the hypothesis that brain\nareas involved in prediction and attention to spatial and kinematic\nsequences are recruited during observation of arti\ufb01cial movement, or in\nthis case movement believed to be of arti\ufb01cial origin.\nTable 4\nBrain areas more active during human compared to computer instruction trials.\nHuman\u2013computer instruction Coordinates (mm)\nArea Cluster volume (mm3) Cluster P Z Laterality x y z\nExtrastriate visual cortex (BA 18) 31,153 b0.0001 6.65 R 20 \u221296 \u221214\nPrimary visual cortex (BA 17) 6.15 R 18 \u2212102 \u22126\nPrimary visual cortex (BA 17) 28,819 b0.0001 5.88 L \u221222 \u2212102 4\nExtrastriate visual cortex (BA 18) 5.68 L \u221226 \u221294 \u22122\nInsula cortex (BA 48) 18,281 b0.0001 3.79 L \u221238 \u221218 0\nParahippocampal (BA 36) 3.7 L \u221222 \u22126 \u221226\nHippocampus (BA 20) 3.56 L \u221228 \u22128 \u221222\nRolandic operculum (BA 48) 3.51 L \u221248 \u221220 16\nAmygdala (BA 34) 3.47 L \u221224 2 \u221216\nParacingulate cortex (medial superior frontal gyrus (BA 10)) 15,056 0.001 4.09 R 12 64 12\nOrbital gyri (BA 11) 3.62 R 6 56 \u221214\nParacingulate cortex (medial superior frontal gyrus (BA 32)) 3.38 R 10 52 26\n396 J. Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400Paracingulate activity responds to human instruction\nOur \ufb01ndings that paracingulate activity differentiates task proces-\nsing in human instruction from computer instruction trials is in keeping\nwith our earlier predictions andwith previouswork demonstrating that\nthis area responds to human or socially related cues (Gallagher et al.,\n2002;McCabe et al., 2001;Ramnani andMiall, 2003; Schultz et al., 2005;\nTavares et al., 2008). The paracingulate cortex has also been associated\nwith tasks that require ToM (Castelli et al., 2000; Frith and Frith, 2006;\nGallagher and Frith, 2003; Gallagher et al., 2000), judging the\ncharacteristics of others (Mitchell et al., 2005a,b; Mitchell et al., 2002)\nor understanding the goals and intentions of another human (Chami-\nnade et al., 2002; Gallagher et al., 2002; McCabe et al., 2001; Tavares et\nal., 2008). Importantly, our task did not directly involve mentalising or\ngoal attribution, yet paracingulate activity was observed in response to\ninstructions that a stimulus represented human movement.\nIt has previously been suggested that different regions within the\nparacingulate cortex may have different functions: ventral paracingulate\ncortex may predominate in self-referential tasks or when judging others\nperceived as similar to oneself, whereas dorsal areas respondmore when\njudgingdissimilar others (Jenkinset al., 2008;Mitchell et al., 2005b, 2006).\nV\u00f6llmet al (2006)have suggested that ventral paracingulate is involved in\nemulating affective valence \u2013 feelings, desires, and motivation \u2013 while\ndorsal paracingulate cortex deals with more abstract mentalising about\nbeliefs and knowledge. In our task, both dorsal and ventral areas wereTable 5\nBrain areas more active during computer compared to human instruction trials.\nComputer\u2013human instruction\nArea Cluster volume (mm3) Cluste\nVentral prefrontal cortex (BA 45) 128,400 b0.00\nVentral prefrontal cortex (BA 44)\nDorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46)\nVentral prefrontal cortex (BA 47)\nInferior parietal lobe (BA 39) 60,881 b0.00\nSuperior parietal lobe (BA7)\nMiddle frontal gyrus (BA 11) 42,731 b0.00\nVentral prefrontal cortex (BA 45)\nVentral prefrontal cortex (BA 47)\nVentral prefrontal cortex (BA 44)\nPrecuneus (BA 7) 41,831 b0.00\nCuneus\nPrecuneus (BA 7)\nInferior parietal lobe (BA 39) 30,394 b0.00\nSuperior parietal lobe (BA39\/7)\nCerebellum crus 1 30,075 b0.00\nCerebellar lobule VIIIA\nInferior temporal gyrus (BA 20) 16,631 0.00\nLingual gyrus (BA 37)\nMiddle temporal gyrus (BA 21)\nInferior temporal gyrus (BA 37)activated differentially according to the nature of the human or computer\ninstructions. Ventral paracingulate cortexappears tobemainly responsive\nto the human instruction (Fig. 4a), whereas themore dorsal region of the\nparacingulate cortex is active when the stimuli and instructions are\ninconsistent (Fig. 4b). These \ufb01ndings support the previous suggestion\n(Jenkins et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2005b; Mitchell et al., 2006) that\nventral paracingulate encodes stimuli deemed to be similar to ourselves\n(i.e. stimuli were interpreted as being of human origin); whereas dorsal\nparacingulate cortex may process information from ambiguous scenarios\nwhere prior knowledge and stimulus content are not easily reconciled\n(perhaps analogous to the dissimilar others hypothesis). It is tempting to\nspeculate that activity in the dorsal region may correspond to the\nbehavioural interaction seen for low stimulus reality.\nRecent behavioural work highlights a prominent role for top-down\nmodulationduringpriming tasks and that thedefaultmode for processing\nstimuli may be at the level of goals and intentions (Chong et al., 2009;\nLiepelt et al., 2008; Longo et al., 2008). Overall, our current results suggest\nthat the paracingulate cortex may be responsible for this top-down\nattribution of goals or intentions to observed movements. Returning to\nour previous work examining the in\ufb02uence of instruction on interference\n(Stanley et al., 2007), the human belief instruction may have led the\nparticipants to view the ambiguous dot movement as the product of\nintentional action, thereby producing interference effects and that the\nparacingulate cortexmayhave played a key role in the attribution of goals\nor intentions to observed movements.Coordinates (mm)\nr P Z Laterality x y z\n01 6.39 L \u221246 28 28\n6.23 L \u221248 20 42\n5.88 L \u221244 52 \u22124\n5.69 L \u221244 46 \u221210\n01 7.62 L \u221244 \u221264 40\n6.29 L \u221236 \u221266 50\n01 5.49 R 32 58 2\n5.4 R 52 28 30\n4.32 R 44 54 \u221212\n4.18 R 48 26 42\n01 7.37 R 2 \u221268 48\n4.88 \u2013 0 \u221272 34\n4.2 L -6 \u221268 38\n01 5.91 R 40 \u221256 48\n5.46 R 36 \u221258 42\n01 5.75 R 8 \u221282 \u221230\n3.76 R 36 \u221266 \u221258\n05 5.02 L \u221268 \u221242 \u221214\n3.64 L \u221226 \u221248 0\n3.42 L \u221244 \u221240 \u22122\n3.39 L \u221260 \u221254 \u221216\nFig. 3.

Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400The effect of task instruction on mirror neuron areas and STS\nOur task did not appear to cause activation of themirror neuron areas\nduring the human instruction or high stimulus reality conditions. The lack\nof modulation of mirror neuron areas by human instruction highlights\nthat even though a movement may be perceived as human, this does not\nguarantee activation in mirror neuron areas.\nThese\ufb01ndings complimentnew ideas currentlypermeating themirror\nneuron literature.

It is possible\nthatour current\ufb01ndingofventralprefrontal cortex (BA44and45)activity\nin the computer instruction trials could add to the above \ufb01ndings, as\nmirror neuronsmay be present in both these regions (Kilner et al., 2009).\nHowever, as this activation was located anterior and superior to\ndocumented mirror neuron areas (Buccino et al., 2004; Grezes et al.,\n2003; Koski et al., 2003) and the location of our inferior parietal activity\nwas more posterior than parietal regions usually demonstrating mirror\nactivity (Engel et al., 2008a; Grezes et al., 2003; Perani et al., 2001) the\npossibility of mirror neuron activity during the computer instruction\nrequires further study. All together, these results support the theory that\nareas related to social understanding (such as the medial prefrontal\ncortex), as opposed to mirror neuron areas, underlie the perception of\nhuman agency (Wheatley et al., 2007).\nIt is also possible that the use of point-light stimuli, combinedwith the\npassivenatureof thecurrent task,maybe responsible for the lackofmirror\nneuron activation in our task. It could be argued that point-light\nanimations may not be suf\ufb01ciently rich visual stimuli to engage mirror\nneuron activity, as previous studies contrasting point-light human actions\nagainst scrambled movements have frequently failed to reveal ventral\npremotor activity (Bonda et al., 1996; Peelen et al., 2006; Pyles et al., 2007;\nServos et al., 2002; however, for exceptions to this see Saygin et al. (2004)\nandVaina et al. (2001)). This hypothesis is reinforced by the apparent lack\nof a correlation between mirror neuron area activity and the stimulus\nrealism dimension in our data; furthermore, no such relationship was\nobserved in the localiser task where the distinction between human and\nscrambled sequences was greater. However, \ufb01ndings of mirror neuron\nactivity when viewing abstract stimuli would appear inconsistent with\nthis interpretation (Cross et al., 2009; Engel et al., 2008a). In regards to\ninstruction, aswithpreviouspoint-light studies (Bondaet al., 1996;Peelen\net al., 2006; Pyles et al., 2007; Servos et al., 2002) our task emphasized\nobservation as opposed to reproduction, andmirror neuron responses are\ngenerally enhanced during tasks that involve imitating, imagining or\npredicting a movement as opposed to just observing (Engel et al., 2008b;\nGrezes et al., 1998; Iacoboni et al., 1999; Koski et al., 2003; Zentgraf et al.,\n2005). Previous tasks that have also cued participants to attend to the\nbehavioural or social aspects of moving abstract stimuli, have failed to\nreport mirror neuron activation (Blakemore et al., 2003; Schultz et al.,\n2005; Tavares et al., 2008). As with our study, it is therefore unclear\nwhether lack ofmirror neuron activity is due to the absence ofmovement\nreproduction or due to the abstract nature of the stimuli, although once\nagain the\ufb01ndings ofmirror neuron activity during observation of abstract\nstimuli would support the reproduction theory. Indeed, Wheatley et al.\n(2007) found mirror neuron area activation when they combined\ncontextual cues to induce a sense of animacy overmoving absract shapes,\nwith a mental simulation and reproduction task.

Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400futurework tomanipulate agency instructions during a task that involves\nmore active simulation processes.\nAs expected, our results revealed that as stimulus realism increased,\nparticipantsmore frequently rated theanimationsas resemblingamoving\nperson. This stimulus realism dimension was positively correlated with\nactivity in the primary and extrastriate visual cortex, fusiform gyrus and\nmiddle temporal gyrus. Activationwithin these regions is consistent with\nprevious studies that have examined neural responses to point-light\nstimuli (Blake and Shiffrar, 2007;Grossmanet al., 2000; Vaina et al., 2001)\nand increased animacy (Schultz et al., 2005), and suggests that these areas\nrespond speci\ufb01cally to the biological content of the stimuli rather than\nbeing in\ufb02uenced by top-down instruction effects. A relationship between\nSTS activity and stimulus realismwas also apparent in this study, albeit at\na reduced level of signi\ufb01cance. Given that STS activity is reduced with\nscrambled point-light motion displays compared to the untampered\nmotion displays (Bonda et al., 1996; Grossman et al., 2000; Grossman and\nBlake, 2002; Saygin et al., 2004), and that evenourhighest stimulus reality\nlevel was partially scrambled, it is possible that the range of realism levels\nused in the study may not have been suf\ufb01cient to fully differentiate STS\nactivity across realism categories. As a consequence of this overall\nreduction in STS activity, our \ufb01ndings that STS activity was notsigni\ufb01cantly different across the 2 categories and that STS activity\nappeared to be greater for human instruction trialswhere stimulus reality\nwas high should be interpreted with caution. Previous studies present\nmixed evidence regarding bottom-up and top-down in\ufb02uences on STS\nactivity, with some demonstrating little top-down in\ufb02uence (Chong et al.,\n2008; Pelphrey et al., 2003a,b; Schultz et al., 2005) andothers suggesting a\nstronger in\ufb02uence (Iacoboni et al., 2001; Pelphrey et al., 2003a,b). Tavares\net al. (2008) observed STS activity when participants were cued to attend\nto the behavioural compared to spatialmovements of twomoving circles,\nwhere these movements contained no biological kinematics. In our\nexperiment, the combination of explicit instructions and clearer biological\nmotion led to increased STS activation, which together with the\naforementioned studies suggests a complex interplaybetween instruction\nand movement type that deserves further research.\nConclusions\nOur results have demonstrated that different brain areas are involved\nwhen participants are informed that an identical visual stimulus is either\nof a human or computer origin: for the human instruction trials, brain\nregions involved in emotion and mentalising are preferentially activated,\nwhereas for the computer instruction trials, areas involved in analysing\nsequences and spatial components of stimuli are activated. The\nparacingulate cortex appears to be a key component of this \u201chuman\nnetwork\u201d and our \ufb01ndings indicate that the simple suggestion of human\nFig. 6.

Stanley et al. \/ NeuroImage 52 (2010) 389\u2013400movement activates this area, even in a task that requires neither social\njudgments nor mentalising processes. This \ufb01nding is consistent with\nrecent work showing top-down in\ufb02uences of human\/computer categor-\nising on activity in the paracingulate cortex (Gallagher et al., 2002;\nMcCabe et al., 2001; Ramnani andMiall, 2003; Schultz et al., 2005; Tavares\net al., 2008), andweposit that theparacingulatemay formpartof adefault\nneural system for processing stimuli interpreted to be of human origin, or\nwhich possess human characteristics (e.g. cartoon human characters,\nwords describing human psychological states; (Gallagher et al., 2000;\nMitchell et al., 2002). We suggest that a person's disposition towards astimulus depends on an interplay between bottom-up processing of the\nstimulus and top-down task instructions encoded or processed by the\nparacingulate cortex. Further work is required to understand how this\ntop-down modulation affects mirror neuron areas and STS.\nAcknowledgments\nWewould like to thank Leif Johansson for recording the actions for the\npoint-light animations; Zoe Kourtzi for the helpful discussions in the\ndesign stages of this process, and, along with Martin Giese for supplying\nthe stimuli for the localizer task; Jonathan Winter for the technical\nassistance; Donna Lloyd for the useful comments on the manuscript; and\nthe fMRI scanner operators at the BirminghamUniversity Imaging Centre\n(BUIC), including Andrew Bagshaw and Rishma Vidyasaga, for their hard\nwork on this project.
