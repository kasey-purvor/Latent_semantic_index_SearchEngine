Yet, until relatively recently intelligence and security matters \nhave not been subject to parliamentary scrutiny or debate. From the 1980s the veil of \nsecrecy which had surrounded the intelligence and security agencies has gradually \nbeen lifted, with legislation, including the Security Service Act 1989 and the \nIntelligence Services Act 1994, placing the agencies and their activities on a statutory \nfooting. This legislation also created, for the first time, some form of oversight of the \nagencies, with the establishment of commissioners to monitor the issuing of warrants \nto interfere with property and communications, and the creation of a committee of \nparliamentarians, the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), to examine the \n\u201eadministration, policy and expenditure\u201f of the intelligence and security agencies.   \n \nHowever, whilst parliament\u201fs contribution to the oversight of the intelligence and \nsecurity agencies is central to providing them with democratic legitimacy and \naccountability (Cabinet Office, 2002), and its role in the scrutiny of legislation and \npolicy relating to the use of intelligence is growing, the current system raises a \nnumber of questions including around the effectiveness of the ISC, the broader role of \nparliament and parliamentarians, and their ability to scrutinise the agencies and the \ngovernment\u201fs use of intelligence. \n \nThe Intelligence and Security Committee \n \nThe establishment of the ISC was a significant step in the development of \nparliamentary oversight of the British intelligence and security agencies. It operates \nwithin the \u201ering of secrecy\u201f and has therefore for the first time allowed MPs and Peers \nto have wide-ranging access to the intelligence and security agencies, documents and \nstaff. The ISC sets its own agenda and, although its proceedings remain secret, it \npublishes annual reports, and has also produced a number of additional reports on \nsubjects of its own choosing. Although its mandate is limited to the examination of \nthe \u201eadministration, policy and expenditure\u201f of the intelligence and security agencies, \nthe Committee has shown an increasing propensity to consider operational matters, \nand some recent studies have argued that it has exceeded expectations in terms of \naccess to information and established itself as a serious critic of the agencies, for \nexample, with reports on the handling of detainees by British intelligence personnel in \nAfghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and Iraq (Gill and Phythian, 2006; Glees, Davies and \nMorrison, 2006; Phythian 2007).  \n \nHowever, the ISC does not provide parliamentary oversight as it is generally \nunderstood with regard to other policy areas. Indeed, it is something of a \nconstitutional anomaly, being a committee of parliamentarians, but not a committee of \nparliament. Unlike select committees the ISC is a statutory committee, the members \nof which are appointed by the Prime Minister after consultation with opposition \n 2 \nleaders. It meets in secret within the Cabinet Office and is staffed by Cabinet Office \nofficials rather than parliamentary clerks. It has no power to require the agencies to \nprovide information, and it reports directly to the Prime Minister, who is able to \ncensor its reports before they are laid before parliament. The Committee\u201fs anomalous \nstatus has led a number of observers to argue that it does little to make the intelligence \nand security agencies more accountable, noting in particular that the separation of the \nCommittee from parliament, and its real and symbolic proximity to the executive and \nthe agencies it is designed to scrutinise, has compromised its independence \n(Lustgarten and Leigh, 1994; Weir and Beetham, 1999; Gill 2007). Some have argued \nthat the Prime Minister\u201fs broad powers to censor reports before publication could be \nused to prevent the disclosure of matters that involve some abuse of functions or \nscandals (Wadham, 1994). Questions have also been raised about the ISC\u201fs reliance \non the agencies to supply information in response to requests from the Committee, \nand the role of ministers acting as \u201egatekeepers\u201f in the provision of that information \n(Wadham, 1994; Gill, 1996). These concerns have been reinforced by reports from \nthe ISC itself about a lack of candour on the part of Ministers (ISC, 2003), and \nprominent recent cases in which the Committee has revisited earlier enquiries to take \naccount of  material which was not made available to them at the time of their original \ninvestigations (ISC, 2009a, 2009b). \n \nPerceived weaknesses in the structure and work of the ISC have been used to \nreinforce calls for its replacement with a parliamentary select committee (for example, \nPhythian, 2007). Although proposals for a select committee on intelligence predate \nthe creation of the ISC, recent statements on both sides of the House suggest that the \nissue has risen up the political agenda. Proposals for changes to the handling of \nintelligence by government and the oversight of intelligence by parliament have been \nmade in statements by the Conservative Shadow Secretary of State for Home Affairs, \nand in the Conservative Party\u201fs national security green paper (Conservative Party, \n2009), whilst the Government\u201fs proposals for constitutional reform have conceded \nthat because the ISC\u201fs reports, \u201eare prepared under separate arrangements and the \nCommittee meets only in private, some argue that the process is insufficiently \ntransparent\u201f, and as a result proposed a number of changes to the way in which the \nISC operates, including public hearings, greater transparency in appointments, and \nreviewing the way in which the committee works with parliamentary select \ncommittees (Ministry of Justice, 2007).  \n \nThe wider role of parliament \n \nThe Government\u201fs proposals for reform of the ISC may be seen as a response to a \ngrowth in parliamentary interest in the work of the intelligence and security agencies \nand in the Government\u201fs use of intelligence. One consequence of the existence of the \nISC has been an increase in the number of parliamentarians with in-depth knowledge \nof the work of the agencies. It has also increased the number of opportunities for \nparliamentarians to debate intelligence issues, with ISC reports having been the \nsubject of an annual debate in the House of Commons since 1998, and in the House of \nLords from 2009.   \n \nThe ISC may also be seen to have stimulated parliamentary interest in others ways. A \nnumber of parliamentary select committees have sought to carry out their own \ninvestigations in areas already scrutinised by the ISC, with the Foreign Affairs \n 3 \nCommittee\u201fs investigation into the government\u201fs presentation of the case for war in \nIraq (FAC, 2004) and the Joint Committee on Human Rights investigation into \nallegations that UK intelligence personnel were complicit in torture (JCHR, 2009) \nboth highlighting perceived limitations in the work of the ISC. Indeed, the \ngovernment\u201fs own decision to appoint an independent committee chaired by Lord \nButler to examine intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was seen by \nsome as a tacit acceptance that the ISC lacks legitimacy (Leigh, 2005). Similarly, the \nHome Affairs Committee (1999), the Foreign Affairs Committee (2004), and the Joint \nCommittee on Human Rights (2006) have all called for greater accountability and \nparliamentary oversight of the intelligence and security agencies, including the \nreplacement of the ISC with a parliamentary select committee. There is also some \nevidence of growing interest in House of Lords in the scrutiny of intelligence issues, \nincluding in 2009 its first ever debate on the work of the Intelligence and Security \nCommittee. The House of Lords also contains a significant body of expertise on \nintelligence, with eleven former members of the ISC now sitting in the House of \nLords, along with former Government ministers and individuals from senior ranks in \nthe armed forces, who have direct experience of handling intelligence material. \nRecent appointments have also brought into the House Peers with direct experience of \nthe agencies, most notably Pauline Neville-Jones, former Chair of the Joint \nIntelligence Committee, and Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former Director General \nof MI5. \n \nHowever, whilst there is evidence of some growth in parliamentary interest in \nintelligence it is not clear whether parliament has the capacity to provide effective \noversight of the intelligence and security agencies. A number of scholars have \nobserved that with few votes or debates, and consequently little opportunity for \npersonal recognition or political advantage, there is little incentive for \nparliamentarians to take an interest in matters relating to intelligence. Perhaps as a \nresult of this, some have identified a lack of expertise among parliamentarians on \nintelligence issues (Lustgarten and Leigh, 1994; Robertson, 1998; Defty 2008). This \nmay have an impact upon the work of the ISC, as access to information is in part \ndependent on the ability to know which questions to ask. As parliamentarians make \nup the Government, it may also have an impact on the effective use of intelligence in \npolicymaking, as observed by the Butler inquiry (Butler, 2004). \n \nConclusions \n \nDespite recent developments, Parliament\u201fs capacity to provide effective oversight of \nthe intelligence and security issues is not clear. Whilst the establishment and \ndevelopment of the ISC has been a significant change, a number of observers in \nparliament and beyond have identified limitations to the Committee\u201fs ability to \nprovide effective scrutiny. \n \nHowever, the focus on the role and nature of the ISC arguably serves to confuse \ndebates over the extent to which parliament is able to scrutinise intelligence issues. \nWhilst changes to the Committee may improve its ability to provide oversight of the \nagencies, it is parliament as a whole which is required to scrutinise the Government\u201fs \nuse of intelligence, as for example, in making the case for war in Iraq. In recent years \na number of bodies have brought forward recommendations for strengthening \nparliament, including the Hansard Society\u201fs Commission on Parliamentary Scrutiny \n 4 \n(2001), the Conservative Party\u201fs Commission to Strengthen Parliament (2000), the \nHouse of Commons Modernisation Committee (2002). If future governments are \nlikely to want to continue to use intelligence to garner public and parliamentary \nsupport for policy, and given the importance of parliament in providing legitimacy to \nthe work of the intelligence and security agencies, it is perhaps important that debates \nabout parliament\u201fs ability and role in scrutinising them and their work, should be \ndiscussed more widely and linked more closely to other proposals for parliamentary \nreform.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nButler, Lord (2004) Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction, London: \nThe Stationery Office. \nCabinet Office (2002) Intelligence Oversight, London: The Stationery Office. \nCommission to Strengthen Parliament (2000) Strengthening Parliament, London: \nConservative Party. \nConservative Party (2009) A Resilient Nation: National Security Green Paper, \nLondon: Conservative Party. \nDefty, A.
