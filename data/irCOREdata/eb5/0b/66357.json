W. Beeby* and R. H. Scott\u2020\nUniversity of Leeds; Durham University\nDetails of an extensive collaborative project to study tension stiffening have been recently published in a number of\npapers. Among other factors, the project investigated the loss of tension stiffening with time. It has been concluded\nthat the reduction of tension stiffening to a constant long-term value is fairly rapid, being complete in 10\u201330 days.\nThis paper explores the mechanisms that may operate to cause the reduction of tension stiffening with time. It is\nconcluded that the loss is mainly attributed to cumulative damage resulting from either the formation of additional\nsurface cracks or the formation or extension of internal cracks. It would appear that the final tension stiffening is\nonly minimally dependent on concrete strength.\nIntroduction\nAn understanding of the interaction of reinforcement\nand the surrounding concrete is fundamental to the\nunderstanding of the behaviour of reinforced concrete.\nThere are a number of aspects to this problem. These\ninclude an understanding of bond behaviour, of crack-\ning behaviour and of the related problem of tension\nstiffening.\nTraditionally, it is assumed in the design of rein-\nforced concrete that concrete carries no tension. On this\nassumption, and assuming elastic behaviour of the steel\nand the concrete in compression, it is possible to calcu-\nlate the stresses and strains in the concrete and the\nreinforcement and hence the deformations of the mem-\nber. In practice, it is found that this procedure over-\nestimates the deformations because the concrete in\ntension surrounding the reinforcement does, on aver-\nage, carry some stress, even after cracking. This reduc-\ntion in deformation or increase in stiffness is referred\nto as \u2018tension stiffening\u2019. It is well known that tension\nstiffening reduces with time under load but there is\nminimal published information on the rate at which this\ntakes place or the actual mechanisms that cause the\nreduction.\nRecently, two linked Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC) grants were\nawarded\u2014one to Durham University and one to the\nUniversity of Leeds\u2014to investigate tension stiffening\nand, in particular, the reduction in tension stiffening\nwith time. In addition to the grants from the EPSRC,\nindustrial contributions to the project, both financial\nand in-kind, were made by Arup Research and\nDevelopment, Giffords, Cadogan Tietz and the Con-\ncrete Society. The experimental work carried out under\nthese grants has enabled a very thorough study to be\ncarried out into the behaviour of concrete in tension\nsurrounding reinforcement.\nA principal finding of the research has been that\ntension stiffening decays rapidly and will reach its\nlong-term value of approximately half the short-term\nvalue in a period of less than 30 days and generally\nless than 20 days. The experimental results relating to\nthis particular conclusion and its practical conse-\nquences have already been presented in earlier\npapers1,2 and will not be discussed further here. In\nthis paper, the results from the experimental work\nwill be used to explore the behaviour of tension\nzones under long-term loading. In particular, in order\nto understand the process of the decay of tension\nstiffening, the results will be used to investigate the\ninternal mechanisms occurring in the concrete sur-\nrounding the reinforcement. Details of the testing and\ninstrumentation and the light shed on the short-term\nbehaviour of tension members have been published\nelsewhere1\u20134 so will not be described in detail in this\npaper.\nMagazine of Concrete Research, 2006, 58, No. 05, June, 255\u2013266\n255\n0024-9831# 2006 Thomas Telford Ltd\n* School of Civil Engineering, The University of Leeds, UK.\n\u2020 School of Engineering, Durham University, UK.\n(MCR 51393) Paper received 7 April 2004; accepted 6 July 2005\nPossible decay mechanisms\nThere are a number of mechanisms which may lead\nto a reduction in tension stiffening. Each of them will\nbe considered, together with their likely effect, in this\nsection.\nCreep\nSince the concrete surrounding the reinforcement is\nsupporting tensile stresses, some degree of creep will\noccur. Studies have been carried out on creep in ten-\nsion. This can differ significantly from creep in com-\npression and the differences appear to depend on the\nnature of the curing regime (for more information see,\nfor example, Neville and Brooks5). In practice, it is\ncommonly assumed that creep in tension and compres-\nsion are the same. In the case of tension stiffening,\nthe problem is not straightforward since the strain in\nthe reinforcement, and hence the strain imposed on the\nconcrete, does not change greatly and therefore the\nissue is more one of relaxation than creep. These, how-\never, are clearly complementary aspects of the same\nphenomenon. It should be noted that, while the com-\npressive stresses in the compression zones of beams or\nslabs tend to be fairly high (several MPa), the average\ntensile stresses in the concrete surrounding the reinfor-\ncement are low (commonly of the order of 1 MPa in\nthe short term). Hence, since creep is proportional to\nstress, the creep is relatively small. Furthermore, since\nthe stress will reduce from the tensile strength of the\nconcrete at initial cracking to a much lower level as\ncracking develops, the creep might be in a creep recov-\nery mode and could be very small or even negative,\ndepending on the rate of loading. Creep can be ex-\npected to be greater in members loaded at a level only\njust above the cracking load because the tensile stresses\nwill be higher for such members than for members\nloaded to higher levels. Overall, the effects of creep are\nlikely to be small and difficult to predict.\nWhen looking at the experimentally obtained varia-\ntion in concrete stress along a bar, the effect of creep\nwould be expected to be a reduction in the peak stress\nand a decreasing reduction in stress as a crack is ap-\nproached. The situation is illustrated schematically in\nFig. 1(a). The change should not be sudden but should\ndevelop gradually over time.\nBond creep is occasionally mentioned as a mechan-\nism of long-term deformation. The effect of such a\nphenomenon would be to reduce the gradient of the\nstress change adjacent to a crack. The effect would thus\nbe indistinguishable from that shown in Fig. 1(a) for\nnormal creep. Indeed, it can be seen that an unavoid-\nable consequence of normal creep (or, more correctly,\nrelaxation) will be a reduction in the shear stresses at\nthe bar\u2013concrete interface, which are commonly re-\nferred to as bond stresses.\nExtension of internal cracks\nGoto6 carried out tests on tension specimens that\nshowed that internal cracks developed from the ribs on\ndeformed bars. By injecting red ink into a duct running\nparallel to a bar in a tension specimen and then cutting\nthe specimen open, Goto was able to observe the pat-\ntern of internal cracking around a deformed bar. Otsuka\nand Osaka7 carried out similar tests in an investigation\nof anchorage behaviour. Their tests suggest that the\ncracks are longest near the face of the concrete and\nreduce in length more or less linearly with increasing\ndistance from the face. This led Beeby and Scott2 to\nsuggest that, on the formation of a primary crack,\ninternal cracks formed as shown in Fig. 2. Since the\nsteel strain is greater than the tensile strain capacity of\nthe concrete over the whole transfer length (So), it was\nsuggested by Beeby and Scott that the internal cracking\nformed over the whole of So almost instantaneously on\nthe formation of the major surface cracks. With time,\nhowever, it seems likely that, although few new internal\ncracks should form, the existing internal cracks could\nlengthen, thus decreasing the stiffness of the connection\nbetween the bars and the surrounding concrete and\nhence decreasing the stress transferred to the concrete\nover the transfer length. The effect of this would be to\nreduce the stresses in the manner shown in Fig. 1(a).\nInspection of the strain distribution will not therefore\nestablish whether the change in stiffening is the result\nof creep or is the result of an increase in internal\ndamage. A fuller analysis of the data will be needed to\nestablish the relative importance of creep and increased\ninternal damage owing to a gradual extension of inter-\nnal cracking.\nShrinkage\nOwing to the fact that the reinforcement does not\nshrink, the shrinkage of the concrete surrounding the\nreinforcement will be constrained and this will cause\ntension stresses to develop. Shrinkage is thus likely to\nlead to the formation of cracks under slightly lower\nloads than would be expected from the tensile strength\nof unrestrained concrete. This can conveniently be con-\nsidered as causing a reduction in the effective tensile\nstrength of the concrete. A simple analysis suggests the\nfollowing relationship for the effect of shrinkage\nf ct,eff \u00bc f ct \u0001 \u0001ct,sh \u00bc f ct \u0001 Esr\u0002sh=(1\u00fe \u00c6er)\nwhere\nfct,eff \u00bc the effective tensile strength of the concrete\nallowing for the effect of shrinkage\nfct \u00bc the direct tensile strength of the concrete\n\u0001ct,sh \u00bc the tensile stress developed in the concrete due\nto restraint of shrinkage by the reinforcement\n\u0002sh \u00bc the free shrinkage strain prior to cracking\nBeeby and Scott\n256 Magazine of Concrete Research, 2006, 58, No. 05\nr \u00bc the reinforcement ratio related to the area of con-\ncrete immediately surrounding the reinforcement\n\u00c6e \u00bc the modular ratio, taking account of an effective\nmodulus of elasticity of the concrete allowing for creep.\nThe formation of new surface cracks\nThe effect of the formation of a new crack is fairly\nobvious, but is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1(b).\nThis change in stress distribution occurs suddenly.

Schematic diagram of effects of long-term phenomena on stresses and strains.\nLong-term decay of tension stiffening\nMagazine of Concrete Research, 2006, 58, No. 05 257\nless dramatic form of this type of event is where, ini-\ntially, a surface crack does not extend around the full\ncircumference of the tension zone but, with time or\nincrease in loading, the crack lengthens. The effect of\nsuch an event is clearly concentrated at an existing\ncrack location.\nSudden internal events\nA variety of possibilities have been bundled together\nhere as, since it is only the effects of the events and not\nthe events themselves which can be observed, their\ncause cannot be established unequivocally, although\ntheir possible causes can be speculated upon. Their\ncharacteristic is that a sudden local reduction in tensile\nstress occurs without any new visible surface cracks\nappearing. In the testing carried out at Durham,2 sev-\neral forms of sudden internal event were identified.\nPossibly the most dramatic event, although relatively\nrare, is a sudden failure adjacent to an existing crack.\nThe effect of this is to detach a length of concrete\nadjacent to a crack from the reinforcement. This could\nbe caused by a local total bond failure, but it seems\nmore likely to be the result of an internal crack of the\nform identified by Goto6 breaking through into the face\nof the crack. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that, if the\ncrack nearest to the primary crack extends, it is likely\nto break through into the crack face. When this hap-\npens, the bar has become detached from the main body\nof the concrete surrounding the bar until beyond the\nfirst crack and there will thus be no transfer of stress\nbetween the bar and the concrete within this region.\nThe effect of this type of event on the stress distribu-\ntion is shown schematically in Fig. 1(c).\nSudden events do occur where the change in the\nstress distribution is of the type shown in Fig. 1(a). The\ncause of this change in stress distribution is not clear\nbut might result from a general increase in length of\nthe internal cracks illustrated in Fig. 2. The possible\nmechanism resulting in a sudden general increase in\ncrack lengths could be as follows. With increasing\ndeformation of the bar and hence the concrete sur-\nrounding the bar, the internal cracks shown in Fig. 2\nare likely to lengthen. If such a crack does lengthen\nthen the stiffness of the concrete cone bounded by the\ncrack will reduce in stiffness and the load transferred\nby this cone between the bar and the concrete will\nreduce and the deformation of the cone will increase.\nThe immediate result of this will be a transfer of force\nto the adjacent cones. The additional load on these is\nlikely to result in them increasing in length and the\nprocess is repeated. Thus, the lengthening of any crack\ncould easily set off a chain reaction of lengthening of\nall the other cracks and an overall reduction in stiffness\nof the concrete immediately surrounding the bar. This\nprocess probably generally happens gradually in gener-\nal but, in this case, the results would be indistinguish-\nable from creep. Owing to the variable nature of\nconcrete, however, it seems possible that, on occasion,\nit happens suddenly.\nSummary of test programme\nThe tests that will be considered in this paper were\nthose carried out at the University of Durham since\nthey provide the most detailed information on the long-\nterm behaviour. The test procedure, instrumentation\nand rig design has been described fully elsewhere4 and\nwill not be described again here. All specimens were\n1.2 m long and had a 120 3 120 mm cross-section re-\ninforced with a single axially placed bar. Three con-\ncrete strengths were used: 25, 70 and 120 MPa. All the\ntests were carried out by loading the specimens in pure\ntension. Pairs of identical specimens were made and,\nwhile one of the specimens was loaded in a single\nincrement to the maximum load, the other was loaded,\ngenerally, in three stages with the load being main-\ntained constant for a considerable period of time at\neach stage. Details of the specimens are given in Table\n1. In the nomenclature of the specimens, the bar size\n(T16 or T20) is given first, followed by either a letter\nR, indicating a specimen where the load was provided\nin three stages or a letter B, indicating that the load\nwas applied in one single increment.

Strain as a function of time for Durham specimen\nT20R3\nBeeby and Scott\n258 Magazine of Concrete Research, 2006, 58, No. 05\nindicates the concrete grade (1 indicates 25 MPa, 2\nindicates 70 MPa and 3 indicates 120 MPa).\nA study of a particular specimen under\nlong-term loading\nHaving discussed the likely forms of event which\ncould lead to long-term decay in tension stiffening, the\nmeans now exist for looking at the development of\nstresses and strains over time to establish the relative\nfrequency of the various causes. This will be done for\nSpecimen T20R3 from the Durham tests. This speci-\nmen was loaded in three stages and the load maintained\nconstant for about 15 to 18 days at each load level. The\noverall behaviour can be seen from Fig. 3 which shows\nthe average strain plotted against time for the whole\ntest.\nThe major deformations are the instantaneous defor-\nmations occurring immediately upon application of the\nload. The deformations are summarised in Table 2\nbelow. The total final deformation was 911 3 10\u00016 of\nwhich 68% was instantaneous and 32% long term. As\ndiscussed in earlier papers,1\u20134 the evidence suggests\nthat there would be little or no further long-term defor-\nmation. It will be seen that the situation is very differ-\nent to creep where the long-term deformation is\ntypically likely to be about double the short-term defor-\nmation.\nIt is now interesting to look at each of the three\nperiods of constant load and attempt to identify the\ncontributions of the various mechanisms leading to\nlong-term deformation. As the free shinkage of the\nconcrete was not measured, the effect of shrinkage\noccurring during the test cannot be isolated. Fig. 4\nshows the strains occurring under a load of 43 kN\nplotted against the time from application of the 43 kN\nload. Log time has been used for convenience for the\ntime axis. Between 15 and 45 min from the load being\napplied, a new crack formed and this resulted in a\nsignificant instantaneous increase in strain. Indeed, the\nformation of the new crack accounts for 70% of the\ndeformation occurring after application of the load.\nThe remaining 30% of the deformation is attributed to\ncreep or a gradual increase in internal damage.\nFigure 5 shows the development of the strain during\nthe time that the load was held at 56 kN. In this case,\nthe time scale is the log of the time from reaching a\nload of 56 kN. Inspection of the stress distributions\nTable 1.

Specimen T20R3\u2014change in strain under load of\n43 kN\nLong-term decay of tension stiffening\nMagazine of Concrete Research, 2006, 58, No. 05 259\nshows that there are two step increases in strain; one\noccurring at about half a day from loading and another\nat 2.1 days from loading. The second event was the\nformation of a new surface crack but the earlier event\ncannot be related to any visible cracking. It is possible\nto see in more detail what is happening by plotting the\nchange in strain between the sets of readings taken just\nbefore and just after the events. This has been done for\nthe two events and the results are shown in Figs 6\nand 7.\nIn the first event (Fig. 6), the change in strain occurs\nover a considerable length of the specimen on either\nside of an existing crack. This can only be the result of\ninternal failure since no further surface crack occurred.\nThe more or less constant small changes in strain in the\nregion from about 750 mm to the right-hand end of the\nspecimen are typical of creep. Since there is no stress\nin the concrete at the cracks there can be no creep at\nthe crack locations but it can be expected to increase\nwith increasing distance from the cracks. The results\nshown in Fig. 7 for the formation of a new surface\ncrack are exactly what would be expected. Of the total\ndeformation occurring while the load was held at\n57 kN, the new crack accounted for 57%, the sudden\ninternal failure for 27% and creep or gradual internal\nfailure for 16%.\nFigure 8 shows the development of strain over the\nperiod when the load was held at 71 kN. Fig. 9 shows\nthe strain change along the length of the specimen over\nthe full period that the load was held at 71 kN. In this\ncase it will be seen that the increase in strain occurs\nalmost entirely in the regions away from the cracks,\nsuggesting that the increase in the average strain is\nalmost entirely caused by creep or a gradual increase in\ninternal damage. There were no new cracks and, had\nthere been significant internal failure, this would have\nresulted in changes in strain which were greater close\nto the cracks and not, as in this case, greatest mid-way\nbetween the cracks.\nTable 3 attempts to summarise the long-term results.\nOverall, it will be seen that two-thirds of the deforma-\n($$\n()$\n)$$\n))$\n*$$\n*)$\n+$$\n.\u0003\u001a\n\u0007\u0017\t\u0018\u001a\u0007\u0006\u0018\u0005\f\u0007\u0003\u0002\u0011\t\n\u001a\n\u0002\u0004\/\u0007\f\u0005\u000f\b\n1\n\u001e\n\n\t\u0005\n \n\n\u0007\b\n\u0004\t\n\u0005\u0003\n\u0002\u0007\n\u0001\n\u0007%\n$*\n$2$% $2% % %$ %$$\nFig. 5.

Specimen T20R3\u2014change in strains under load of\n71 kN\nBeeby and Scott\n260 Magazine of Concrete Research, 2006, 58, No. 05\ntion were attributed to sudden failure events, which\nresulted in step changes in the deformation, and one\nthird can be ascribed to creep or a gradual extension of\nthe internal cracks.\nFigure 10 shows the load\u2013deformation response for\nspecimen T20R3 compared with the response of the\ncompanion specimen T20B3. While T20R3 was loaded\nup in three stages with the load kept constant for 15\ndays at each stage, T20B3 was loaded up to the maxi-\nmum load in a single step and then held at that load for\n45 days. The final deformations of both specimens are\nvery similar, suggesting that the final deformation is\nlargely independent of the load history.\nAnalysis of the increase in deformation with time\nunder the maximum load for specimen T20B3 shows\nthat no extra cracks occurred during this period. The\ncauses of the deformations are much less clear than in\nT20R3 but some idea of possible amount which may be\nascribed to creep and internal failure may be obtained\nby considering the gradient of the plots of strain against\nlog time. These should be the same for T20R3 and\nT29B3 since the specimens were cast at the same time\nand maintained in the same environment. This study\nsuggests that gradual and sudden phenomena each con-\ntributed about 50% to the total long-term deformation.\nHaving discussed in detail the behaviour of a typical\nspecimen, the results from all the tests will be sum-\nmarised. This is done in Table 4.\nDiscussion of results\nFigures 11 (a) and (b) show, for the specimens re-\ninforced with 16 mm and 20 mm bars respectively, the\ninstantaneous strain and the total strain. For the R\nseries tests where loading was generally applied in\nthree increments, the instantaneous strain is the sum of\nthe instantaneous strains occurring on application of\neach load and similarly for the long-term strains. Two\npoints are immediately discernable. First, the instanta-\nneous strains where incremental loading was carried\nout are always significantly smaller than those obtained\nwhere the loading was all applied at one time. Second,\ndespite this, the total strain is more or less the same\nregardless of the loading mode. This confirms the re-\nsult illustrated in Fig. 10 for specimens T20R3 and\nT20B3. A further point, which is not quite so clear, is\nthat concrete strength has little effect on the final\ndeformation. The effect is actually rather less than the\ngraphs indicate because the loading varied somewhat\nbetween specimens. Notably, specimens T20-3 were\nonly loaded to 70.5 and 71 kN whereas T20-1 speci-\nmens were loaded to 74.5 and 74 kN and T20-2 to 72.5\nand 72.8 kN. T16-3 specimens were loaded to rather\nhigher loads than the other 1 mm reinforced specimens.\nNo attempt has been made to correct for these minor\nloading differences.\nFigures 12 (a) and (b) consider the long-term incre-\nments in strain. The graphs show the total long-term\nincrements for the two forms of loading (solid lines)\nand the total increment assessed to have occurred as\nsudden events such as the formation of an additional\ncrack (broken lines). It is interesting that for members\nreinforced with 16 mm bars, there is a clear increase in\nlong-term deformation with increase in concrete\nstrength. This is less clear for specimens reinforced\nwith 20 mm bars for the highest strength but a general\nincrease in long term deformation can still reasonably\nbe postulated. It is also clear that the long-term defor-\nmations where the loading was applied in one incre-\nment were substantially smaller than those obtained\nwhere the load was applied in stages. The assessment\nof the increment owing to sudden events is somewhat\nsubjective in some cases but the lines are believed to\ngive a reasonable indication of behaviour. On average,\nsudden events contribute approximately 30% to the\nlong-term deformation. This is somewhat less than for\nTable 3.

There are two approaches to con-\nsidering this question: the amount of creep that can be\nexpected from current prediction methods for creep and\na consideration of whether the results obtained for the\ngradual increase in deformation are consistent with\nexpected creep behaviour.\nTaking the first approach, the CEB Model Code 90\nincludes a method for the prediction of creep that is\ngenerally considered to be reasonable for creep in com-\npression.

The stress in the concrete over time\nhas been calculated for all load stages in all specimens\nbut, for the purposes of this brief study, an average\nstress will be used for each test. Table 5 gives the total\nlong-term deformation and that part of the long-term\ndeformation considered to be gradual at the end of each\ntest together with the calculated deformation owing to\ncreep. It will be seen that, except for the lowest-\nstrength specimens where the load was applied in a\nsingle increment, creep is predicted to be able to ac-\ncount for only a very small portion of the long-term\ndeformation.\nThe second approach is slightly more difficult to\ndemonstrate owing to the relatively small long-term\ndeformations. It will have been seen from the earlier\nstudy that the gradual component of the long-term\ndeformation can be conveniently expressed as a straight\nline on a plot of deformation against log time. This\nsuggests that the form of the relationship between gra-\ndual deformation and time for, for example specimen\nT16R2, is as sketched schematically in Fig. 13. At first\nglance it could be assumed that this is the form of\nrelationship expected from creep where the load is\napplied in a number of stages. This is, however, mis-\nleading. Fig. 14 shows the variation in concrete stress\nover the whole period of the testing of T16R2. It will\nbe seen that, although there are small local \u2018blips\u2019 in\nthe tension stress at the time of application of each load\nincrement, the concrete stress actually remains more or\nless constant over the test period at an average of about\n0.45 MPa.

The\ntype of relationship obtained seems more consistent\nwith a major change in the rate of change of deforma-\ntion on the application of load to be the result of\nadditional internal damage rather than creep which, by\ndefinition, is stress related. Studying these two ap-\nproaches, it seems reasonable to conclude that the con-\ntribution of creep to the long-term deformation of\ntension zones is small and that the deformation is\ndominantly a result of cumulative damage of one form\nor another.\nIt has already been noted that in all cases the total\nfinal deformations of the two specimens making up any\npair are very similar. The average difference is 6% with\na maximum difference of 10%. There are, however,\nvery significant differences in how this final value of\ndeformation is reached. In all cases, the sum of the\ninstantaneous deformations on applying each loading\nincrement is smaller for the stepped loading regime\nthan for the single loading while the sum of the long-\nterm increments under constant loads is larger. The\ndetailed study of the behaviour of T20R3 and T20B3\ndescribed above makes clear why this is so. Looking at\nFig. 4, which shows the change in deformation in\nspecimen T20R3 under the lowest load level of 43 kN,\nit will be seen that a new crack occurred within 1 h of\nthe load being applied and that this made up a major\npart of the long-term deformation under this load. It is\nreasonable to assume that, had a slightly higher load\nbeen applied, the crack would have occurred during\nloading and hence would have been classified as part\nof the instantaneous deformation not the long-term\ndeformation. A similar argument can be used for all the\nother instances of sudden failure events (new cracks or\ninternal failures) occurring during the periods of con-\nstant load below the maximum. In T20B3, where the\nload was increased in one step up to the maximum,\nabout the same total amount of deformation occurred\nowing to failure events as in T20R3 but all appear as\npart of the short-term deformation. Thus, calculation of\nshort-term deformations and the establishment of the\nfinal deformation by adding a long-term increment to\nthis, or by factoring the short-term deformation, is a\nsomewhat dubious procedure. The values of the short-\nterm and long-term deformations depend on just what\ncracks or internal failure events have occurred during\nthe loading and what cracks and internal failure events\noccur during the period of constant loading. The way\nthese events are distributed between short term and\nlong term is a stochastic process depending on the\nvariation of concrete strength along the length of the\nmember and is not uniquely predictable. Since, how-\never, the total amount of failure that occurs appears to\nbe largely independent of the loading history, the final\ndeformation appears to be calculable with much more\nreliability. This provides a strong argument for ignoring\nthe short-term behaviour of tension zones and concen-\ntrating in practice on the prediction of only the long-\nterm behaviour. It also casts doubt on the usefulness of\nmethods where the short-term deformation is calculated\nand then multiplied by a factor to obtain a long-term\ndeformation.\nIt has been suggested above that the major cause of\nthe decrease in tension stiffening with time is an in-\ncrease in cumulative damage. To some extent this is\ncaused by the formation of further surface cracks but to\na larger extent, this seems likely to be the result of\ninternal phenomena. It is suggested that the most likely\ninternal phenomena are related to internal cracking\nwhere there are three possibilities: increase in the num-\nber of internal cracks, increase in the length of internal\ncracks and breaking through of the internal cracks\nnearest to crack surfaces into the cracks. A possible\ncause of all these possible modes of increase in cumu-\nlative damage can be hypothesised. It is well known\nthat both the tensile and compressive strength of con-\ncrete decrease with time under constant load.

It will be seen that the\ntensile strength appears to reduce by about 35% over a\nperiod of around 1 to 10 days, which is similar to the\ntime during which tension stiffening is found to reduce.\nThis suggests that the increase in cumulative damage\nand hence the loss of tension stiffening may simply be\nthe result of a reduction in tensile strength of the con-\ncrete surrounding the reinforcement. Some confirma-\ntion of this can be obtained from inspection of current\ncalculation methods for tension stiffening. For example,\nthe calculation method given for deformations in Euro-\ncode 28 would give, for the deformation of a member\nsubjected to pure tension, the following relationship\n\u0002sm \u00bc (1\u0001 \u0003)\u0002s1 \u00fe \u0003\u0002s2\nwhere\n\u0003 is given by \u0003 \u00bc 1 \u0001 \u0004(Nr\/N)2\n\u0002s1 is the strain in the reinforcement calculated assum-\ning the section is uncracked\n\u0002s2 is the strain in the reinforcement calculated on the\nassumption that the concrete carries no tension (i.e. the\nconcrete is fully cracked)\nNr is the axial load which will just result in the tensile\nstrength of the concrete to be reached\nN is the axial load considered\n\u0004 is a factor that takes account of the duration of\nloading. \u0004 \u00bc 1 for short-term loads and 0.5 for long-\nterm loads.\nIt will be seen that the reduction of \u0004 from 1 to 0.5\nwould give the same result as reducing the tensile\nstrength of the concrete, and hence Nr, by 30%. This is\nclose to the reduction in strength shown in Fig. 15.\nIt has been suggested, though the evidence is not\nabsolutely clear, that final deformation is largely inde-\npendent of concrete strength. Rutner10 has also come to\nthis conclusion. It appears that this occurs because,\nalthough the short-term deformation may reduce with\nincrease in tensile strength, the long-term deformation\nincreases substantially with increase in concrete\nstrength. This suggests that high-strength concrete suf-\nfers a greater loss of tensile strength with time under\nload than does normal strength concrete. More research\nis needed to confirm or disprove this. If tension stiffen-\ning is largely independent of concrete strength, this\ncasts doubt on deformation prediction methods such as\nthat in EC28 where the deformation is strongly depen-\ndent on the tensile strength of the concrete.\nConclusions\n(a) It has been demonstrated in previous papers that\nthe loss of tension stiffening with time takes place\nrelatively rapidly with the long-term final tension\nstiffening being reached within a period of 20 to\n30 days.\n(b) It is suggested in this paper that the major mechan-\nism controlling the long-term loss of tension stif-\nfening is the development with time of cumulative\ndamage. This may be the formation or extension of\nexisting surface cracks or the development or ex-\ntension of internal cracks. Creep plays an insignif-\nicant part in the changes in tension stiffening with\ntime.\n(c) The final deformation of a tension member appears\nto be largely independent of load history and po-\ntentially more accurately determinable than the\nshort-term deformation. The short-term deforma-\ntion is heavily dependent on the precise state of\ncracking at the moment when the load is applied,\nwhich is highly unpredictable. The formation of\ncracking (or the development of cumulative da-\nmage) will have stabilised by the time that the\nlong-term value of tension stiffening has been at-\ntained.\n(d) It should be noted that the change in deformation\nowing to the loss of tension stiffening is relatively\nsmall compared with the initial deformation. This\nis not to be confused with the situation in more\nheavily reinforced flexural members where the\nlong-term deformation is dominantly the result of\ncreep in the compression zone, which can lead to\nlarge changes in deformation.\n(e) It is suggested that the loss of tension stiffening\nwith time is largely attributed to an increase in\ncumulative damage which, in turn, results from the\nreduction in tensile strength of concrete with time\nunder load.\n( f ) There is evidence that the final tension stiffening\nmay be largely independent of concrete strength.\nThis, if confirmed by further research, may have\nsignificant practical consequences.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work reported in this paper was started as part\nof a joint project carried out at the universities of Leeds\nand Durham, supported mainly through grants from the\nEPSRC.
