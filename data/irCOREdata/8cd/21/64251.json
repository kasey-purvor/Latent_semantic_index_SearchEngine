The\npresent paper will review the potential for biofortification of UK food crops with Se.\nAgronomy: Diet: Fertilisers: Genetics: Plants: Selenium\nPhysical, chemical and biological properties\nof selenium\nSe is a naturally-occurring oxygen-group (group VIA)\nelement (for review, see Fordyce, 2005). Se has an atomic\nmass of approximately 79 and six natural isotopes exist,\n74Se, 76Se, 77Se, 78Se, 80Se and 82Se. It is a chalcophile\n(\u2018S-loving\u2019) element, replacing S in common sulfide\nminerals such as pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and spha-\nlerite. It also forms several rare minerals including crooke-\nsite ((Cu, Tl, Ag)2Se), berzelianite (Cu2Se) and tiemannite\n(HgSe). Se exists in four main oxidation states, - 2 (sele-\nnide), 0 (elemental Se), +4 (selenite) and +6 (selenate),\nand is highly mobile under oxidising conditions, although\nits mobility decreases with decreasing pH (Gondi et al.\n1992). Se is immobile under reducing conditions; ele-\nmental Se or metal selenides will form in conditions of low\nH+ (pH) and electron (pe\/Eh; a measure of the tendency of\na chemical system to undergo redox reactions) activity.\nThe solution chemistry of Se is principally (oxy)anionic,\nwith selenite (SeO3\n2-) and selenate (SeO4\n2-) corres-\nponding to sulfite and sulfate, although elemental Se is also\nstable over a wide pH range under reducing conditions\n(Brookins, 1987). Selenate is the major species in soil\nsolution at high redox (pe+ pH >15). In the medium redox\nrange (pe+pH 7.5\u201315) selenite species predominate. Sele-\nnide species are stable only at low redox (pe+pH <7.5;\nElrashidi et al. 1987, 1989). In contrast with S species, the\nlower redox state (+4; selenite) is more stable than the\nhigher redox state (+6; selenate). Mobile selenate entering\na drainage system is readily reduced to selenite if pe\/Eh\nfalls, whilst at lower pH levels selenite is likely to be\nstrongly absorbed by hydrous secondary iron oxides and, to\na lesser extent, by clays and organic matter.\n*These authors contributed equally.\nAbbreviations: HAST, high-affinity sulfate transporter; Sec, selenocysteine.\n\u2020Corresponding author: Dr Martin Broadley, fax + 44 0115 951 6334, email martin.broadley@nottingham.ac.uk\nProceedings of the Nutrition Society (2006), 65, 169\u2013181 DOI:10.1079\/PNS2006490\ng The Authors 2006\nSe is a biologically-active element that can form direct\nSe\u2013C bonds, which occur in a range of organic compounds\nincluding selenoamino acids and selenoproteins. Seleno-\nproteins have essential functional roles in a wide array of\nprokaryotes, archaebacteria and eukaryotes (Driscoll &\nCopeland, 2003; Castellano et al. 2004). Se is incorporated\ninto selenoproteins as the twenty-first amino acid seleno-\ncysteine (Sec), which is encoded by an UGA codon in the\nselenoprotein mRNA. Since UGA is normally read as a\nstop codon, the translation of selenoproteins requires sev-\neral factors including a cis-acting Sec insertion sequence\n(frequently located in the 30 untranslated region of seleno-\nprotein genes), a novel Sec-charged tRNA that contains\nthe anticodon UCA on which Sec is universally synthe-\nsised and additional trans-acting factors that allow\ndelivery of Sec-tRNASec to the ribosome (Driscoll &\nCopeland, 2003). About twenty-five to thirty Sec-\ncontaining proteins have been identified in eukaryotes,\nalthough these proteins are not distributed evenly amongst\ntaxa; for example, selenoproteins have not yet been found\nin yeast and land plants. In organisms whose genomes\nlack Sec-containing genes selenoprotein homologues occur\nin which Sec is replaced by cysteine (Castellano et al.\n2004).\nSelenium inputs to soils\nThe Se concentrations of most soils in the world are low\n(normal range 0.01\u20132.0mgSe\/kg; mean 0.4mg Se\/kg),\nalthough concentrations \u00a31200mg Se\/kg can occur in\nseleniferous soils (Fordyce, 2005). The Se content of most\nsoils is primarily under geological control, and high-Se\nsoils are associated with particular shales, sandstones, lime-\nstones and slate and coal series, including those formed in\nCretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Carboniferous, Ordovician\nand Permian periods (Fordyce, 2005). Seleniferous soils\nare widespread in the Great Plains of the USA, Canada,\nSouth America, China and Russia. Other notable inputs of\nSe to soils include atmospheric deposition of Se originating\nfrom volcanic activity, weathering of rocks, sea spray and\nvolatilisation\u2013recycling from biota. All these factors con-\ntribute to global Se cycling. In the UK atmospheric Se\ndeposition is approximately 2.2\u20136.5 g Se\/ha per year\n(Fordyce, 2005). Anthropogenic sources of Se to soils arise\nfrom fossil fuel combustion, metal processing, applications\nof fertilisers, lime and manure, and disposal of sewage\nsludge (Fordyce, 2005). Se from fossil fuel combustion and\nmetal processing is deposited to soils predominantly in\nrainwater, which contains 0.00001\u20130.001mg Se\/l (De\nGregori et al. 2002). A correlation between the intensity of\ncoal combustion and Se deposition has been observed in\nthe Se content of historical plant samples (Haygarth et al.\n1993). The use of fertilisers and irrigation water containing\nSe will also contribute to soil Se inputs in certain areas.\nFor example, (NH4)2SO4 fertilisers contain \u00a336mgSe\/kg,\nwhilst phosphate rocks and single superphosphate can con-\ntain \u00a355mg Se\/kg and \u00a325mgSe\/kg respectively (White\net al. 2004). Since single superphosphate has generally\nbeen replaced by triple superphosphate, which typically\ncontains <4mg Se\/kg, fertiliser inputs of Se to soils have\nfallen in recent years in many parts of the world.\nSelenium concentration of UK soils and\nstream sediments\nThe British Geological Survey has been surveying the\nbaseline geochemistry of UK drainage sediments in\nstreams, water samples and soils since the late 1960s\n(Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment; John-\nson & Breward, 2004). For Se, soils and\/or stream sedi-\nments in Wales and in the Midlands of England have\nbeen sampled at a density of one to two samples per km2.\nSamples of stream sediments and surface waters have been\nanalysed for Se in Wales and the west Midlands, whilst in\nthe Humber\u2013Trent drainage basin and in the east Midlands\nsoils, stream sediments and surface waters have been\nanalysed for Se (Fig. 1). From these data it can be observed\nthat total Se in soils and stream sediments in the UK range\nfrom 0.1mg Se\/kg to 4mg Se\/kg, with >95% of the UK\nsoils containing <1mg Se\/kg. Despite the low abundances\nof this strongly chalcophile element there is a good reso-\nlution of Se-enriched features in restricted areas.\nIn Wales stream-sediment Se concentrations are pri-\nmarily under geological control, including sulfide miner-\nalisation in Snowdonia, with secondary mixed iron\u2013\nmanganese oxide enrichment in mid-Wales and industrial\ncontamination in the south Wales coalfield and in the\nindustrial west Midlands (Fig. 1(a)). Strong sulfate\u2013\nselenate associations occur in the Triassic terrain of the\nWorcester and Stafford basins related to the evaporitic\ncomponent of the Mercia Mudstone group. In Humber\u2013\nTrent stream sediments and soils (Fig. 1(b, c)) Se concen-\ntrations are high over the basinal Visean deposits and\nlower parts of the Namurian deposits in the south-west\nof the region where there is a well-developed Black Shale\nsequence within the Widmerpool Formation. Se con-\ncentrations are also high over the area of the Trent Valley\nbetween Newark and Gainsborough, where the Quaternary\nalluvial sediments may contain material derived from the\nformer area. One isolated Se anomaly is attributable to coal\nwaste adjacent to a power station. Relatively high values\nalso follow the Permian and Jurassic limestone outcrops.\nVery low Se concentrations are present over the marine\nalluvium of the coastal strip and the Fens, although natural\nstream coverage is poor in the latter area. In stream sedi-\nments and soils of the east Midlands (Fig. 1(d, e)) high\nSe levels are prominent at sites over river alluvium in the\nDove, Derwent and Trent valleys. These high levels are\nalmost certainly a result of material derived from the Black\nShale lithology of the Widmerpool Formation and the\nhydrothermal sulfide mineralisation of the Peak District.\nLow Se concentrations occur over Triassic terrain gener-\nally, especially to the south of Birmingham and Coventry,\nwith higher concentrations over the lower and middle\nJurassic terrain. Elsewhere, high Se concentrations around\nBirmingham are likely to be industrial in origin, whilst a\nprominent high-Se feature extending from the north of\nGrantham to the south of Peterborough may be associated\nwith peat deposits.

Broadley et al.\nsouth-east of the map may be associated with the Bed-\nfordshire brick industry, but this association is not yet\ncertain (Fig. 1(e)).\nUptake, assimilation and accumulation of selenium\nby plants\nSe has no proven function in plant nutrition. However,\nplants take up Se from the soil solution primarily as sele-\nnate, and to a much lesser extent as selenite. Selenate\nenters root cells through sulfate transporters in their plasma\nmembranes (Terry et al. 2000; White et al. 2004). Sulfate\ntransporters are encoded by a small family of genes in\nmost plant species; these transporters are hydrophobic\nmembrane proteins with twelve predicted membrane-\nspanning domains and few large extramembrane loops but,\ngenerally, with long N and C termini (Hawkesford, 2003,\n2005). There are fourteen genes encoding sulfate trans-\nporters in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.\nand a similar number in groups of other plant species\n(Hawkesford, 2005). All sulfate transporters characterised\nto date can be placed into one of five groups based on\ntheir protein sequences (Hawkesford, 2003, 2005), with\neach group having distinct functional characteristics.\nGroup 1 transporters, such as AtSultr1 :1, AtSultr1:2 and\nAtSultr1:3, are high-affinity sulfate transporters (HAST)\nthat are thought to catalyse most selenate influx to plant\ncells. Sulfate uptake is regulated by gene transcription\n(Hawkesford, 2005); AtSultr1 :1 and AtSultr1 :2 catalyse\nsulfate influx to Arabidopsis roots and their expression is\ninduced by S starvation (Takahashi et al. 2000; Yoshimoto\net al. 2002; Maruyama-Nakashita et al. 2003). The ex-\npression of these HAST also appears to correlate well with\nplant Se uptake. For example, plants lacking group 1\nHAST have reduced selenate uptake (Shibagaki et al.\n2002), whilst the overexpression of genes encoding group\n1 HAST in transgenic plants increases Se uptake (Terry\net al. 2000). Interestingly, although the expression of genes\nencoding HAST is generally reduced when a plant has\nsufficient S, increasing the selenate concentration in the\nrhizosphere of S-replete plants can increase shoot S con-\ncentrations (Bell et al. 1992; White et al. 2004). This\nphenomenon has been interpreted as the consequence\nof either selenate or Se metabolites de-repressing the ex-\npression of genes encoding HAST (Takahashi et al. 2000;\nGrantham\nCorby\nPeterborough\nBedford\nBoston\nRugby\nDERBY\nLEICESTER\nNOTTINGHAM\nNorthampton\nBanbury\nBIRMINGHAM\nCOVENTRY\nmg\/kg\n1\u00b73\nFrequency distribution\nFr\neq\nu\nen\ncy\nSe concentration (mg\/kg)\nPercentile\n99\n0\u00b78 95\n0\u00b77 90\n0\u00b75 75\n0\u00b74 50\n0\u00b73 25\n0\u00b73 15\n0\u00b72 10\n0\u00b72 5\nAbsent\ndata\n(e)\n50\nFig. 1. Baseline selenium concentrations in UK drainage sediments in streams, water samples and soils from the Geochemical\nBaseline Survey of the Environment of the British Geological Survey (BGS; Johnson & Breward, 2004). Soils and\/or stream\nsediments were sampled at a density of one to two samples per km2 in Wales and in the Midlands of England. Samples of\nstream sediments were analysed for selenium in Wales and the west Midlands of England (a), whilst in the Humber\u2013Trent\ndrainage basin and in the east Midlands of England, stream sediments (b and d respectively) and soils (c and e respectively)\nwere analysed.

Although several of the HAST will\ntransport selenate, the molecular structure responsible for\ntheir anionic selectivity is not known.\nFollowing uptake selenate is likely to be transported\nto the plastids, or may remain in the cytoplasm where it is\nassimilated via the S assimilation pathway (for reviews\nof Se assimilation in plants, see Terry et al. 2000; Ellis &\nSalt, 2003; for a review of S assimilation see Hawkesford,\n2005). Briefly, selenate is activated by ATP sulphurylase\nto form adenosine 50-phosphoselenate, which is reduced to\nselenite in the presence of adenosine 50-phosphosulfate\nreductase, and subsequently to selenide via a non-enzymic\nstep in the presence of glutathione. Selenide is assimilated\ninto Sec and further into selenomethionine. These seleno-\namino acids can be incorporated into proteins non-\nspecifically, which can cause toxicity to the plant.\nSelenoamino acids can also be methylated; for example,\nSe-methylSec is a characteristic Se assimilation product\nwithin species in the genera Allium and Brassica, which\nincludes numerous crop species of commercial importance\nincluding onions, leeks, garlic, oilseed rape and cabbages.\nMethylated selenoamino acids can be converted to methyl\nselenol (Lu et al. 1995; Ip et al. 2002) and ultimately to\ndimethylselenide and volatilised (Ellis & Salt, 2003). Se\nassimilation impacts directly on shoot Se accumulation.\nThis relationship is supported by the observations that:\n(1) overexpression of ATP sulphurylase and\/or genes\ninvolved in glutathione synthesis in transgenic Brassica\njuncea (L.) Czern. results in increased shoot Se accumu-\nlation (Pilon-Smits et al. 1999; Ban\u02dcuelos et al. 2005); (2)\noverexpression of a Sec methyltransferase gene, which\nmethylates Sec to methylSec in Astragalus bisulcatus\n(Hook.) A. Gray results in increased Se accumulation in\ntransgenic A. thaliana and B. juncea (LeDuc et al. 2004);\n(3) expression of a Sec lyase, which breaks down Sec\nin mice, in the cytoplasm or in chloroplasts results in\nincreased shoot Se concentration in transgenic A. thaliana\n(Pilon et al. 2003).\nFlowering plant (angiosperm) species differ in their\nability to assimilate and accumulate Se (Rosenfeld &\nBeath, 1964; Dhillon & Dhillon, 2003; Ellis & Salt, 2003;\nWhite et al. 2004). These species can be divided into three\ngroups: non-accumulators; Se indicators; Se accumulators.\nNon-accumulator plants rarely contain >100mg Se\/g DM,\nSe-indicator plants can contain \u00a31000mg Se\/g DM and\nSe-accumulator plants can contain \u00a340 000mg Se\/g DM\nwhen sampled from Se-rich environments, e.g. in areas\nof western USA where soils have been derived from\nseleniferous shale and sedimentary materials. Also, non-\naccumulator plants have a lower Se:S in their shoot tissues\nthan Se-accumulator plants (Bell et al. 1992; Feist &\nParker, 2001). Remarkably, there is often no correlation\nbetween the shoot Se and S concentrations of different\nplant species (or even genotypes of the same species)\ngrowing in the same environment (Feist & Parker, 2001;\nWhite et al. 2004). This finding suggests that the trans-\nporters responsible for the uptake or translocation of Se\nare selective for either sulfate (in non-accumulator plants\nwhose shoot Se:S is lower than that in the rhizosphere\nsolution) or selenate (in Se-accumulator plants whose\nshoot Se:S ratio is higher than that in the rhizosphere\nsolution). A selective advantage associated with plant\nSe accumulation has been suggested, since increased Se\nconcentration protects B. juncea against infection with\nFusarium and Alternaria and against herbiovory by aphids\nand caterpillars but not snails (Hanson et al. 2003, 2004).\nExamples of Se hyperaccumulators include members of\nthe Fabaceae (Astragalus bisulcatus, A. racemosus Pursh),\nAsteraceae (Aster occidentalis (Nutt.) Torr. & A. Gray,\nMachaeranthera ramosa A. Nelson), and Brassicaceae\n(Stanleya pinnata (Pursh) Britton). In Se accumulators\nSe predominantly occurs as non-protein-amino acid forms,\nSe-methylSec, and in a conjugated form as g-glutamyl-\nmethylSec, but also as selenocystathione, selenohomo-\ncysteine, g-glutamyl-selenocystathione, methyl selenol and\nselenate (Pickering et al. 2000, 2003). Extreme Se accu-\nmulation (as high as 22 g\/kg DM) has been reported in\nthe fruit of some species within the Lecythidaceae family.\nThis neotropical family of trees comprises 325 species\nwithin ten genera (Morton et al. 1998), including the\nfamiliar edible Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa Humb. &\nBonpl.) and less-familiar edible nuts such as the Paradise\nnut (Lecythis zabucaja Aubl.). However, the ingestion\nof certain other Lecythis species, including Coco de Mono\n(L. ollaria Loefl.) and Sapucaia nut (L. elliptica Kunth),\ncan induce acute selenosis in human subjects (Kerdel-\nVegas, 1966; Dickson, 1969), characterised by symptoms\nof hair and nail loss, alongside other dermatological,\nneurological and gastric disorders (Fordyce 2005). In\nB. excelsa the dominant form of Se is selenomethionine\n(Vonderheide et al. 2002; Kannamkumarath et al. 2005).\nSelenium is an essential element for man\nSe was identified as an essential element for mammals in\nthe 1950s (Schwarz & Foltz, 1957). There are approxi-\nmately thirty mammalian selenoproteins, about half of\nwhich have been characterised (Rayman, 2002). These\nproteins include those with functional roles as antioxidants\n(e.g. glutathione peroxidase) and those that contribute to\nprotein stability, transcription of mRNA and other bio-\nchemical functions. Given these functions it is not surpris-\ning that Se is important for human health, and Se\ndeficiency in human subjects has been linked to a plethora\nof physiological disorders (Rayman, 2000, 2002; Jackson\net al. 2004). For example, low Se status causes Keshan\ndisease (a cardiomyopathy) and Kashin-Beck disease (an\nosteoarthritis disorder) in parts of China where dietary\nSe intakes are extremely low (Fordyce, 2005). As a result\nof its role as an antioxidant, low Se status has also been\nlinked to CVD, pancreatitis, asthma and inflammatory\nresponse syndrome (Rayman, 2000, 2002). Further, there is\nevidence that low Se status impacts on immune system\nfunctioning, response to viral infection, female (e.g.\nreduced rates of miscarriage) and male (e.g. sperm devel-\nopment and function) fertility and thyroid functioning if\nSe and I status are both deficient (Rayman, 2002).\nThere is substantial evidence that Se is a potent anti-\ncarcinogen when it is present at levels above those required\nfor the maximal expression of selenoproteins, i.e. well\nabove those levels associated with incipient Se deficiency\n174 M. R. Broadley et al.\n(Combs, 2005). Indeed, both organic and inorganic forms\nof Se consistently inhibit cell growth and stimulate pro-\ngrammed cell death in vitro, whilst there is supporting\n(albeit inconclusive) epidemiological evidence of inverse\nrelationships between Se status and the incidence of cancer\n(Combs, 2005). For example, in a randomised clinical trial\n200mg Se\/d has been shown to reduce total cancer inci-\ndences by a factor of 0.63 and to reduce incidences of\ncarcinomas of the prostate and colon\u2013rectum by 0.51 and\n0.46 respectively (Clark et al. 1996, 1998; Combs, 2005).\nSelenium intake and status have declined in the UK\nIndividual Se intakes range from 3 to 7000mg Se\/d world-\nwide, although most intakes are at the lower end of this\ndistribution (Fordyce, 2005). Se intake in the UK has\ndeclined from >60mg Se\/d in 1974 to 29\u201339mg Se\/d (for\nreviews, see Rayman, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004). In several\nother EU countries Se intakes are less than half the UK\nreference nutrient intakes of 60 and 75mg Se\/d for females\nand males respectively (Rayman, 2004). A concomitant\ndecline in Se status based on analysis of blood and serum\nhas been reported, and thus the UK population may be at\nrisk from an increased prevalence of certain health dis-\norders (Rayman, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004). Cereals rep-\nresent a major source of Se in most UK diets, and the\ndecline in Se intake and status in the UK has been attrib-\nuted to changes in the sourcing of the wheat used for flour\nproduction from grains that are high in Se concentration\nand grown on high-Se soils in North America to UK-\nsourced wheat that has been grown on low-Se soils and has\na low grain Se content. The use of UK wheat in grists has\nrisen from 15% in the 1950s to >80% in 2005 (Lea,\n2005).\nThe baseline Se concentration of wheat grain used in\nUK bread has been analysed in samples taken in 1982,\n1992 and 1998 (Adams et al. 2002), and a minimal dif-\nference in mean grain Se concentration between these\nsamples has been found (0.025, 0.033 and 0.025mgSe\/kg\nrespectively, with interquartile ranges varying from 0.015\nto 0.019mg Se\/kg). By comparison, mean values of 0.370\nand 0.457mg Se\/kg have been reported for US wheat\ngrain and 0.760mg Se\/kg for Canadian grain (Adams et al.\n2002). Worldwide, the Se content of wheat grain ranges\nfrom 0.001 to 30mg\/kg, being predominantly within the\nrange 0.020\u20130.600mgSe\/kg (Lyons et al. 2005a). It is\nimportant to emphasise that the primary reason for higher\nconcentrations of Se in US and Canadian wheat grain than\nin wheat grain from the UK is a result of differences in the\nunderlying geology and consequent higher Se concen-\ntrations in the North American soils. It is less related to\ndifferences in historical or current agronomic practices or\nto soil nutrient depletion. Consistent with the hypothesis\nof a link between Se content of wheat and dietary Se\nintakes and status is the observation that in New Zealand\nSe intakes and status increased when Australian wheat\ncontaining higher levels of Se were imported (Watkinson,\n1981; Thomson & Robinson, 1996). In addition to changes\nin the sourcing of wheat grain, levels of Se in UK diets\nmay also have declined in recent years because of changes\nin fertiliser practices (e.g. replacing single superphosphate\nwith triple superphosphate; White et al. 2004), or dilution\nin the crop as a result of improved yields (Adams et al.\n2002). Further, since Se and pyritic S concentrations are\ncorrelated in coal (Spears et al. 1999), declines in Se inputs\nmay also be related to a decline in the intensity of coal\ncombustion following the Clean Air Act of 1956 (Ministry\nof Housing and Local Government, 1956; Haygarth et al.\n1993) and\/or the use of low-S coal or desulphurisation\ncombustion technologies.\nBiofortifying crops in the UK\nThe decline in Se intake and status in the UK can be rec-\ntified by dietary diversification, mineral supplementation\nof human subjects or livestock, food fortification during\nprocessing or through crop biofortification (Rayman, 2002,\n2004). Since foods such as Brazil nuts, offal and crab meat,\nwhich naturally contain high levels of Se, are not eaten in\ngreat quantities, the potential for dietary diversification to\nincrease Se delivery in the UK is limited (Rayman, 2002).\nThe use of high-Se-containing supplements, including\nyeast-based formulations, appears to be an effective and a\nsafe option for human subjects (Rayman, 2004). However,\nsupplements are relatively expensive and only a small\nproportion of the population are likely to take such per-\nsonal intervention measures, particularly since recent EU\nlegislation restricts the sale of such supplements. During\nflour processing in the UK statutory nutrients are currently\nadded to flour using a pre-blend that contains CaCO3, Fe,\nthiamin and nicotinamide. Although Se could be fortified\nthrough this route, alterations to this blend would require\na change in legislation. There is also a food safety issue\nassociated with storing concentrated Se compounds in a\nmill or a baking environment. The present review will\ntherefore focus on the strategy of biofortification, defined\nas increasing the bioavailable concentrations of essential\nelements in edible portions of crop plants through the use\nof fertilisers (agronomic biofortification) or through crop\nselection or breeding (genetic biofortification; Graham\net al. 2001; Bouis, 2003; Bouis et al. 2003; Lyons et al.\n2003).\nAgronomic biofortification\nThe potential for using Se-containing fertilisers to increase\ncrop Se concentrations, and thus dietary Se intakes, in\nthe UK has been proposed previously (Adams et al. 2002;\nRayman, 2002; Arthur, 2003). Possible strategies for Se\nfertilisation in the UK based on data obtained from other\nparts of the world will be reviewed. Strategies based on\nfertilising both pasture or forage crops for consumption by\nlivestock and crops intended for direct human consumption\nwill be considered.\nBiofortification of pastures or forages using Se fertilisers\nhas been widely demonstrated (for reviews, see Gissel-\nNielsen, 1998; Gupta & Gupta, 2002). The primary driver\nfor supplying pastures or forages with increased Se has\nbeen to prevent disorders amongst grazing livestock. For\nexample, the muscular dystrophy disorder, white muscle\ndisease, is associated with low-Se-status soils, notably in\nEnhancing the nutritional value of plant foods 175\nAustralia, New Zealand and parts of North America\n(Wichtel, 1998; Lee et al. 1999; Fordyce, 2005). In early\nstudies it was demonstrated that Na2SeO4 or K2SeO4 is\nmore available for immediate uptake by pasture crops than\nselenite (Gissel-Nielsen, 1998). However, in the years fol-\nlowing Se application selenite or less-soluble forms of\nselenate (e.g. BaSeO4) were found to provide longer-\nlasting effects. For example, in Australia the application of\nprilled Se fertilisers (i.e. a granulated compound form) to\npastures grazed by sheep was shown to increase crop Se\nconcentration and consequently whole-blood and plasma\nSe concentrations, thereby increasing wool yield and live\nweights (Whelan et al. 1994a,b). In these studies it was\nfound that 3\u20135 g Se\/ha per year supplied as Selcote1\n(comprising 10 g Se\/kg as Na2SeO4) provides an adequate\nSe supply to sheep for 1 year, whilst 10 g Se\/ha per year,\nsupplied as slow-release Selcote Two Year1 (10 g Se\/kg\nas 1:1 Na2SeO4:BaSeO4; 10 g Se\/kg), provides adequate\ncover for 3 years. In Canada it has been shown that Selcote\nUltra1 (10 g Se\/kg as 1:3 Na2SeO4:BaSeO4) increases Se\nuptake by lucerne (Medicago sativa L.; Gupta, 1995). Crop\nSe concentration is increased from 0.067 to 0.187 and\n0.220 at 5 and 10 g Se\/ha per year respectively in the first\ncut and in the first year after application. Similarly, Se\nconcentration in the first cut of Italian ryegrass (Lolium\nmultiflorum Lam.) is increased from 0.067 to 0.231 and\n0.292 at 5 and 10 g Se\/ha per year respectively. In sub-\nsequent years crops grown on soils that have initially\nreceived Se fertilisation contain more Se than non-ferti-\nlised control crops.\nElsewhere, similar increases in the Se concentration of\npasture and forage crops in response to applications of low\nlevels of Se have been reported. For example, in Canada\nan increase in Se concentrations has been reported for red\nclover (Trifolium pratense L.), timothy (Phleum pratense\nL.) and Italian ryegrass (Gupta & MacLeod, 1994). In\nthe USA the Se concentration of bahia grass (Paspalum\nnotatum Flu\u00a8gge) sprayed with Selcote Ultra1 at 5 g Se\/ha\nper year has been shown to increase, as has that of fescue\n(Festuca spp.) top-dressed at the same rate (Valle et al.\n2002). In Ireland Se uptake by ryegrass (Lolium perenne\nL.) has been found to increase from 0.10 and 0.13 Se\nmgSe\/kg dry weight in control plots to 0.62 and 0.19 Se\nmgSe\/kg at first and second cuts respectively in response\nto 76 g Se as Na2SeO3\/ha per year (Murphy & Quirke,\n1997). Numerous other studies have demonstrated the ease\nof increasing the Se concentrations of pasture or forage\ncrops using small quantities of Se fertilisers applied\ndirectly to the soil or applied as foliar sprays (Peterson &\nButler, 1962; Davies & Watkinson, 1966; Cary et al. 1967;\nWatkinson & Davies, 1967; Cary & Allaway, 1969, 1973;\nGissel-Nielsen & Bisbjerg, 1970; Gissel-Nielsen, 1977,\n1984, 1986; Gupta & Winter, 1981, 1989; Gupta et al.\n1982; Watkinson, 1983; Gissel-Nielsen et al. 1984; Van\nDorst & Peterson, 1984; Yla\u00a8ranta, 1984c; Whelan, 1989;\nCoutts et al. 1990; Rimmer et al. 1990; Shand et al. 1992;\nJukola et al. 1996; MacLeod et al. 1998; Gupta & Gupta,\n2002; Valle et al. 2002).\nIt is clearly possible to increase the Se concentration\nof pasture and forage crops by Se fertilisation, and com-\nmercial products are available for supplying low levels\nof Se. Selcote Ultra1 (Nufarm NZ, Auckland, New\nZealand) was first released in 1989\u201390 to replace previous\nformulations Selcote1 and Selcote Two Year1, which\nwere released in the early 1980s (M Shirer (AgBioR-\nesearch Ltd, Richmond, New Zealand), personal commu-\nnication; there have been several changes in the ownership\nof Selcote1 products, and companies cited in scientific\npublications include Lime and Marble Ltd, Agtech Devel-\nopments Ltd, ICI Rural Division, ICI Crop Care, Crop\nCare, Nufarm NZ and AgBioResearch Ltd, which has been\nan international distributor of Selcote Ultra1 since the late\n1990s). In New Zealand Se can be applied to a maximum\nof 10 g Se\/ha per year (M Shirer, personal communication).\nIn 1999 Top Stock1 (Yara UK, Immingham, Lincs., UK),\ncontaining 0.012 g Se\/kg, was released to the UK market.\nRecommended application rates for Top Stock1 are\n6.6 g Se\/ha, and >25 000 ha grassland in the UK are cur-\nrently treated with this product.\nBiofortification of food crops for human consumption is\na more direct strategy to increase dietary Se intake (Gissel-\nNielsen, 1998; Gupta & Gupta, 2002). For example, the Se\nconcentrations of wheat grain and flour can easily be raised\nby applying low concentrations of Se to soils (Eurola et al.\n1989; Stephen et al. 1989; Singh, 1994; Lyons et al. 2003,\n2004, 2005a,b). This strategy is also applicable to other\ncereal and grain crops (Gupta & Gupta, 2002); for exam-\nple, in field-grown rice the foliar application of 20 g Se\/ha\nincreases the Se concentrations of rice grain from a control\nlevel of 0.071 (SD 0.002) to 0.471 (SD 0.134) and 0.640\n(SD 0.191) when Se is supplied as selenite and selenate\nrespectively (Chen et al. 2002).\nThe best example of biofortification of food crops\nfor human consumption using Se fertilisers comes from\nFinland. As a consequence of low dietary Se intakes the\nFinnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry decided in\n1983 that Se would be incorporated into all multinutrient\nfertilisers used in agriculture from 1 July 1984 onwards\n(for reviews of the Finnish experience, including the pri-\nmary literature sources for the Finnish Ministry directives,\nsee Yla\u00a8ranta, 1984a,b,c; Varo et al. 1988; Eurola et al.\n1989, 1991, 2004; Aro et al. 1995; Vena\u00a8la\u00a8inen et al. 1997;\nRayman, 2002; see also references cited therein). The pri-\nmary aim of the Finnish policy was a 10-fold increase in\ncereal-grain Se concentration (Vena\u00a8la\u00a8inen et al. 1997). For\ngrain production and horticulture 16mg Se\/kg was added\nto multinutrient fertiliser formulations, whilst for fodder\ncrop and hay production 6mg Se\/kg was added. However,\nsince >10-fold increases in shoot Se concentration were\nreported in the years following initial Se applications, a\nnew directive came into force from 16 June 1990 onwards,\nand fertilisers containing 16mgSe\/kg were removed from\nthe market and a single level of supplementation of\n6mg Se\/kg was used (Vena\u00a8la\u00a8inen et al. 1997). In 1998 Se\nsupplementation was increased from 6 to 10mg Se\/kg\nfertiliser for all crops.\nThe effect of adding Se to fertilisers for crops in Finland\nhas been marked; for example, Se concentrations have\nincreased in 125 indigenous food items (Eurola et al.\n1991). Notably, the Se concentration of wheat bran has\nincreased 10-fold from 0.03 to 0.35mgSe\/kg DM. The Se\ncontent of all fruit and vegetables was <0.01mg Se\/kg DM\n176 M. R. Broadley et al.\nbefore Se supplementation (except lettuce (Lactuca sativa\nL.) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), for which Se con-\ntents were 0.01 and 0.02mg\/kg DM respectively; Eurola\net al. 1989). After Se fertilisation \u202110-fold (and \u00a3100-\nfold) increases in the Se concentration of vegetable and\nfruit crops were reported (Eurola et al. 1989). Although the\nSe concentration of all crops has increased, more subtle\neffects have also been noted. For example, Se fertilisation\nhas increased the Se concentration of oats (Avena sativa\nL.; Eurola et al. 2004). Not surprisingly, the grain Se\nconcentration is greater in crops supplied with fertilisers\nincorporating Se at 10mg\/kg than at 6mg\/kg, and it is\nlower in grain from organic production systems in which\nno fertilisers have been added. The Se concentration of oat\ngrain is higher in seasons of low precipitation, and cultivar\ndifferences have been detected in variety trials. The Se\nconcentrations of meat, meat products, fish, dairy products\nand processed foods have all increased following the\nintroduction of Se fertilisation (Eurola et al. 1991); for\nexample, for pig muscle meat and liver the Se concen-\ntrations were found to have increased from 0.08 and\n0.49mg\/kg respectively in 1985 to a peak of 0.30 and\n0.73mg\/kg respectively in 1989 (Vena\u00a8la\u00a8inen et al. 1997).\nSimilarly, the Se concentrations for cattle muscle and liver\nincreased from 0.07 and 0.28mg\/kg respectively in 1985 to\n0.21 and 0.51mg\/kg respectively in 1989.\nBased on average Finnish diets, it has been reported\n(Eurola et al. 1991) that there was an increase in Se intake\nfrom 25mg\/d per capita in 1975\u20136 to 124mg\/d per capita\nin 1989, and an increase in the consumption of Se from\nall foodstuffs. Notably, for cereals the increase in Se\nconsumption was from 9 to 30mg\/d per capita between\n1975\u20136 and 1989. Over the same period the increase in the\nSe consumption (mg\/d per capita) was from 0.4 to 4 for\nvegetables and fruit, from 7.7 to 45 for meat, from 7.9 to\n12 for fish and from 5.4 to 32 for dairy products and eggs\n(Eurola et al. 1991). Furthermore, a concomitant increase\nin blood (Varo et al. 1988) and serum (Wang et al. 1998)\nSe concentrations has been reported. For example, for\nFinnish children aged <15 years of age, the increase in\nmean serum Se was from 0.87 (range 0.54\u20131.44)mmol\/l\nin 1985 to 1.26 (range 0.96\u20131.57)mmol\/l in 1986 (Wang\net al. 1998). Similarly, in adults, serum Se increased\nfrom 1.04 (range 0.62\u20131.35)mmol\/l in 1985 to 1.30 (range\n0.87\u20131.72)mmol\/l in 1986. These increases have been\nsubsequently maintained. Increases in the Se status of\nFinnish human milk between 1987 and 1995 have also\nbeen noted (Kantola & Vartiainen, 2001). Thus, the use of\nSe fertilisers in Finland has increased the crop Se content,\nincreased dietary Se intakes and increased the Se status of\nthe Finnish population (Rayman, 2002).\nGenetic biofortification\nAlthough it may be possible to increase the consumption of\ncrop species that are genetically predisposed to accumulate\nmore Se, dietary diversification is not always feasible\n(Rayman, 2002). However, within-species genetic varia-\ntion could be used to increase the delivery of Se to human\ndiets, i.e. through genetic biofortification (Lyons et al.\n2004). In the first instance, it may be possible to simply\nselect existing varieties of crops that accumulate more Se.\nIn the longer term, it may be possible to breed crops for\nincreased Se concentration.\nThere are few data on varietal differences in Se accu-\nmulation for most crop species. However, in the most\ndetailed study reported to date Lyons et al. (2005a) have\nsurveyed grain Se concentrations in commercial and ad-\nvanced breeding lines of wheat, in ancestral diploid\n(Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal.) and durum wheats\n(Triticum dicoccum (Schrank) Schubl.) and their progeny,\nin wheat landrace accessions, in wheat recombinant inbred\nand doubled haploid mapping populations and in other\ncereal grains from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), triticale\n(X Triticosecale Wittmack ex A. Camus.) and rye (Secale\ncereale L.). Grain Se concentrations vary from 0.005 to\n0.720mgSe\/kg, although most of the variation in grain Se\nfrom these species is attributed to soil factors. However,\nA. tauschlii accumulates most Se in the grain and there is\ntherefore the potential to breed for increased grain Se\nconcentration in wheat (Lyons et al. 2005a).\nIn other crops, 4-fold differences in shoot Se accumu-\nlation between four Lycopersicon cultivars (tomatoes and\nrelatives) grown at low sulfate levels have been reported\n(Pezzarossa et al. 1999). Differences in short-term net Se\nuptake and shoot Se concentration have also been noted\namongst eight Lycopersicon esculentum L. cultivars and\nsix other Lycopersicon species, with greater variation in\nshoot Se concentration between wild Lycopersicon taxa\nthan between cultivated Lycopersicon taxa (Shennan et al.\n1990). Variation in Se accumulation has also been reported\nfor soyabean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.; Yang et al. 2003;\nZhang et al. 2003) and onion (Allium cepa L.; Kopsell &\nRandle, 1997), whilst Se accumulation in rapid-cycling\nBrassica oleracea L. has been shown to be moderately\nheritable, with expected gains of 5% per cycle of recurrent\nselection (Kopsell & Randle, 2001).\nIn non-crop species shoot Se concentrations have been\nfound to vary amongst sixteen populations of Stanleya\npinnata by 1.4-fold\u20133.6-fold and shoot Se concentrations\ncorrelate with the Se concentration of the soil from which\nthe populations were originally collected (Feist & Parker,\n2001).\nFor a given crop species, if sufficient genetic variation\nexists in Se accumulation, and if this variation is heritable,\ntraditional breeding programmes could be developed that\nwould provide an alternative to agronomic biofortification\nand thus minimise the need to use Se fertilisers except at\nthe lowest soil Se concentrations (Lyons et al. 2004,\n2005a).\nIn addition to identifying suitable germplasm for breed-\ning, accelerated breeding strategies to increase Se con-\ncentration in crops may also be possible. For example, Se\naccumulation can be quantified in different accessions of\nmodel crop or non-crop plant species for which genetic\nmaps are available. Inbred progeny from crosses between\nthese two accessions can then be used to map Se accumu-\nlation to specific chromosomal loci, i.e. quantitative trait\nloci analyses (Vreugdenhil et al. 2005; Wissuwa, 2005).\nFollowing the identification of quantitative trait loci im-\npacting on shoot Se accumulation, for example, candidate\nEnhancing the nutritional value of plant foods 177\ngenes or loci could be resolved through fine mapping, and\nsequence information could be used directly, for gene-\nbased selection or marker-assisted breeding. An advantage\nof this strategy is that knowledge of the genes and\/or\nchromosomal loci controlling Se accumulation in one plant\nspecies could be used in a different target crop species. It\nis also possible to devise breeding or selection strategies\n(conventional or through genetic modification) for increas-\ning shoot Se concentration based on existing knowledge\nof Se (and S) uptake and assimilation. For example, over-\nexpressing ATP sulphurylase and\/or genes involved in\nglutathione synthesis increases shoot Se accumulation\nin transgenic B. juncea (Pilon-Smits et al. 1999; Ban\u02dcuelos\net al. 2005), whilst overexpressing a Sec methyltransferase\ngene that methylates Sec to methylSec in A. bisulcatus\nincreases Se accumulation in transgenic A. thaliana and\nB. juncea (LeDuc et al. 2004).\nPerspective\nSe intake and status in the UK population can be increased\nin the short term through agronomic biofortification. The\npasture and forage sector already uses commercial Se fer-\ntilisers and an increased usage in this sector could increase\ndietary Se intakes through meat and dairy products. How-\never, in order to provide adequate quantities and forms\nof Se for the widest possible number in the population Se\nfertilisation of crops for direct human consumption is\nlikely to be needed. Such a strategy has been adopted in\nFinland, and there is substantial evidence to demonstrate\nthat this strategy is biologically safe and environmentally\nacceptable (Wang et al. 1994; 1995; Ma\u00a8kela\u00a8 et al. 1995).\nFrom a crop perspective, antagonistic and synergistic\ninteractions between Se and S will occur during plant\nuptake that may affect crop quality (White et al. 2004).\nThese interactions will depend on the prevailing relative\nconcentration of each of the elements in the soil. However,\nat low external S, and under low rainfall conditions, Se\nfertiliser application rates of \u00a3200 g Se\/ha have not been\nfound to induce toxic effects or to retard growth in a low-\nyielding wheat crop (Lyons et al. 2005b).\nIn cereals selenomethionine is the dominant organic\nform of Se. Wheat is the most efficient accumulator of\nSe within the common cereal crops (wheat> rice>maize>\nbarley>oats) and it is one of the most important Se sources\nfor human subjects in the UK (Lyons et al. 2003). Thus,\nwheat is an obvious target crop for agronomic biofortifi-\ncation to increase the dietary Se intake, and thus the Se\nstatus, of the UK population. Currently, the average Se\nlevel in the grain of UK wheat is 25\u201333mg Se\/kg (Adams\net al. 2002). Since the application of 10 g Se\/ha applied as\nNa2SeO4 to the soil or as a foliar feed is likely to increase\ngrain concentrations by 10-fold, a Se-fertilisation strategy\nto rectify dietary Se deficiency for large sections of the\npopulation would require only a small addition of Se\nthrough fertilisation. In contrast, vegetables and fruit\ndeliver small proportions of minerals to the diet (White &\nBroadley, 2005). Thus, altering Se concentrations of these\ncrops will have a minimal effect on dietary Se intakes.\nHowever, some vegetables contain organic forms of Se\nthat make them attractive complimentary targets for\nbiofortification. For example, Se-methylSec occurring in\nAllium and Brassica crops can be converted directly into\nmethyl selenol, a bioactive substance that may protect\nagainst cancer (Lu et al. 1995; Ip et al. 2002; Whanger,\n2004).\nIn addition to providing adequate quantities and forms\nof Se, an effective fertilisation strategy must be demon-\nstrably safe to the environment. Although >95% UK\nsoils for which geochemical data are available contain\n<1.0mg Se\/g, elevated soil Se levels are associated with\nrestricted geological, alluvial and industrial features\n(Fig. 1) and thus Se-fertilisation strategies must be devised\nand monitored appropriately. In the UK the quality and\nquantity of baseline geochemical data for soils, stream\nsediments and surface waters will enable such monitoring\nto be undertaken with confidence. However, total Se con-\ncentration in soil does not necessarily indicate its bio-\navailability, and thus factors influencing Se bioavailability\nmust also be considered. In the longer term, it may be\npossible to exploit genotypic variation in Se accumulation\nin crops to select or breed varieties with increased Se\n(Lyons et al. 2004, 2005a), thereby minimising the need to\nuse Se fertilisers in all but the lowest soil Se situations.\nThis strategy may have economic advantages over a strat-\negy based entirely on fertilisation.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors from the Universities of Nottingham and Warwick\nacknowledge financial support from the Biotechnology and\nBiological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the UK\nand Yara (UK).
