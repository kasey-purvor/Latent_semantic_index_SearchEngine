INTRODUCTION\nThe nuclei near the N=50 shell closure constitute a tradi-\ntional ground for testing different shell model calculations,\nand for extracting information on the residual interactions\n[1\u20134]. For example, the early calculations of Gross and Fren-\nkel [2], within the restricted model space (2p1\/2 and 1g9\/2)\nand using an empirical interaction, were successful for the\nN=48\u221250 nuclei. The study was later extended to the nuclei\naway from the shell closure by using the same model space\n[5,6]. However, when a similar study was applied for the N\n=46 nuclei [7,8], it showed a generally weaker agreement\nwith the measurements than that found for the N.47 nuclei.\nOne of the reasons for the discrepancy might be the restric-\ntion in the configuration space when performing the shell\nmodel calculations. Indeed, the very recent shell model cal-\nculations of Hasegawa et al. [9], in which a larger space\ns2p3\/2 ,1f5\/2 ,2p1\/2 ,1g9\/2d is used, have been able to repro-\nduce the known high spin data in 90Ru.\nA study of the N=46 nuclei is especially interesting since\nit appears that near this neutron number the structure changes\nrapidly from the spherical to the deformed type [10]. For the\nshell model based on a spherical basis, the configuration\nspace needed for these nuclei (as employed in [9]) is huge,\nand it approaches the limit of what can be presently handled\nfor this mass region. On the other hand, the shell models\nbased on a deformed basis, such as the projected shell model\n[11], will gradually loose the advantages when moving from\nthe well-deformed sZrd to the spherical sSnd region. Thus,\nthe nucleus 90Ru is among a limited number of cases where\nboth types of shell model, spherical- and deformed-based,\ncan be applied, and thus can be tested comparatively against\ndata.\nTo test various theoretical predictions, more detailed ex-\nperimental information of these nuclei, such as that of high\nspin states and non-yrast bands, is very much desired. The\nnucleus 90Ru was studied before with a heavy-ion fusion-\nevaporation reaction [7], its yrast line being observed up to\n6.4 MeV in excitation and 16+ in spin. In this work we ex-\ntend the experimental level scheme of the yrast band, and\npresent a new band with negative parity. These data are com-\npared in detail with calculations performed with the pro-\njected shell model.\nThe experimental results for 90Ru will be presented in\nSec. II, with an illustration of the systematics of band struc-\ntures with both positive and negative parity in several N\n=46 isotones. In Sec. III, the data will be compared with the\npredictions of the projected shell model. From the same cal-\nculation, there appear some low-lying high-K bands in 90Ru,\nwhich will also be discussed. Finally, the paper will be sum-\nmarized in Sec. IV.\nII. THE EXPERIMENT\nThe 90Ru nucleus has been populated in the 40Ca+ 58Ni\nreaction, performed with a 40Ca beam of 135 MeV delivered\nby the Legnaro XTU Tandem accelerator. The beam intensity\nwas around 8 particle nA and the target was a 6 mg\/cm2\n58Ni foil. The g-rays were detected with the GASP array [12]\nin its standard configuration with 40 Compton\u2013suppressed\nHPGe detectors and an 80 BGO element inner ball, and the\ntrigger condition was that at least two Ge detectors and one\nBGO fired in coincidence. More details of this experiment\nare given in Refs. [13,14]. Important for the present study of\n90Ru (populated through the 2a channel) is the use of the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 064319 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/69(6)\/064319(6)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 064319-1\nISIS Silicon ball [15], an array of 40 DE -E telescopes ar-\nranged in a geometry similar to that of GASP. The DE de-\ntectors were protected by absorbing foils such as to remove\nthe scattered Ca beam, the final efficiency obtained for the\ndetection of one a-particle being of 38%. Gating g -g coin-\ncidences with two a-particles selected practically only the\ntransitions from 90Ru. The level scheme of this nucleus has\ntherefore been very conveniently constructed, by starting\nfrom the known yrast transitions [7] and working on a sym-\nmetric g -g -g cube or a g -g matrix sorted with this condi-\ntion.\nFigure 1 shows the level scheme obtained from this ex-\nperiment. Figure 2 shows a few spectra obtained from g-ray\nwindows on the symmetric g -g matrix gated by two\na-particles, which illustrate the two band structures from\nFig. 1. Information on the multipolarities of the g-ray tran-\nsitions could be deduced from g-ray angular distributions\nand directional correlation orientation (DCO) ratios. The\ng-ray angular distributions were extracted from spectra of\nthe seven rings of GASP detectors, gated by two a-particles.\nThe relative intensities of the gamma-ray transitions, as well\nas the Legendre polynomial coefficients of their angular dis-\ntributions are given in Table I. The DCO ratios, also given in\nTable I, have been determined from an asymmetric g -g ma-\ntrix coincident with one a particle, in which the energy of\nthe g-rays detected in the detector rings at 35\u00b0 or 145\u00b0 was\nrecorded on one axis, while that of the g-rays detected at\n72\u00b0, 90\u00b0, or 108\u00b0 was recorded on the other axis. By includ-\ning the two rings closest to 90\u00b0 the efficiency of the proce-\ndure was increased. The DCO ratios were determined as\nFIG. 1. Level scheme of 90Ru\nas determined from the present\nexperiment. For details see text\nand Table I.\nBUCURESCU et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 064319 (2004)\n064319-2\nRDCO =\nIsg1 at 72 \u00b0 or 90 \u00b0 or 108 \u00b0 ;g2 at 35 \u00b0 or 145\u00b0d\nIsg1 at 35 \u00b0 or 145 \u00b0 ;g2 at 72 \u00b0 or 90 \u00b0 or 108\u00b0d\n.\nIf the gating transition g1 is of stretched quadrupole type, the\nDCO ratio of the g2 transition is expected to be about 0.5 for\na stretched dipole transition, and about 1.0 for a stretched\nquadrupole transition; this was checked on transitions of\nknown multipolarities.\nThe positive parity yrast line up to the 16+ state contains\nthe same transitions as observed in Ref. [7]. Nevertheless, on\nthe basis of our intensities (Table I) we have interchanged the\npositions of the 886 and 946 keV transitions. Some yrare\npositive parity transitions and two transitions above the 16+\nstate have been added; also, we have established the spin-\nparity 14+ for the Ex=5732 keV state, previously assigned as\ns13+,14+d, and observed the new state at 5817 keV, assigned\nas 13+. Figure 3 shows systematic trends of the levels ob-\nserved in the N=46 isotones 86Zr [16], 88Mo [17], and 90Ru\n(this work). The new placement of the 886 and 946 keV\ntransitions from the ground state band of 90Ru leads to a\nsmoother systematic of this band. As seen in Fig. 1, a new\nband which feeds the 4+ yrast state has been established. Its\nspin values (Fig. 1) were assigned on the basis of the angular\ndistribution and DCO ratio data (Table I). This band contin-\nues smoothly the systematic of a negative parity band well\nestablished in the lighter isotones, and therefore, we have\ntentatively assigned it as a negative parity band. The two\ntransitions in the upper part of this structure (722 and\n1100 keV) have both the angular distribution coefficients\nand the DCO ratios with larger errors, which did not allow a\nmultipolarity assignment.\nIII. THE PROJECTED SHELL MODEL DESCRIPTION\nA description of the positive-parity yrast levels in 90Ru\nwith a spherical shell model approach has been presented in\ndetail in three previous papers [7\u20139]. The calculations in\nRefs. [7,8] considered the 2p1\/2 and 1g9\/2 subshells outside a\nsemimagic 88Sr core as the model space, and used the single-\nparticle energies and two-body matrix elements of Gross and\nFrenkel [2]. The order of the 13+ and 14+ states (see Fig. 1)\nwas well predicted by these calculations, and the decay of\nthe 15+ state towards both these states was reasonably well\ndescribed [7]. A negative parity structure was also predicted\n[8], starting around the excitation energy of 3.2 MeV. On the\nother hand, the calculated positive-parity yrast band, shown\nin both cited papers [7,8], was more compressed than the\nobserved one. Improved agreement for the 90Ru yrast band\nwas obtained by the recent shell model calculation [9], in\nwhich an enlarged model space s2p3\/2 ,1f5\/2 ,2p1\/2 ,1g9\/2d and\nan extended pairing plus quadrupole interaction were em-\nployed. In the following, we discuss the observed structure\nof 90Ru within the framework of the projected shell model.\nA. The calculation conditions\nIn contrast to the spherical shell models [7\u20139], the pro-\njected shell model (PSM) builds its model basis by using\nFIG. 3. Systematics of band structures in the N=46 isotones.\nThe data for 86Zr are from Ref. [16], those for 88Mo from Ref. [17].\nThe band observed in the present work above the state with spin 5\nat Ex=2603 keV is very similar to the negative parity bands known\nin the lighter isotones, and is therefore tentatively proposed as the\nanalogue negative parity band.\nFIG. 2. Examples of g-ray coincidence rela-\ntionships. The spectra are obtained by gating on\nthe specified transitions, on a g -g symmetric ma-\ntrix coincident with two a-particles.\nHIGH-SPIN STATES IN 90Ru AND THE PROJECTED\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 064319 (2004)\n064319-3\ndeformed (Nilsson-type) quasiparticle states [11]. One ad-\nvantage of this approach is that the dominant nuclear corre-\nlations can be incorporated efficiently in the wave functions.\nTherefore, the PSM can treat the well-deformed nuclei with-\nout running into problems related to dimension explosion.\nThe deformed Nilsson states violate angular momentum.\nHowever, there are well established projection techniques\nwhich allow a recovery of this quantum number.

Thus, we have a consistent\ntheoretical framework for even-even, odd-A, and odd-odd\nnuclei. Our calculations are performed for 90Ru with the ba-\nsis deformation e2=0.16. It is interesting to mention that the\nfact that the PSM prefers the choice of such a deformed basis\nwas discussed in the spherical shell model point of view [9].\nB. Comparison with the data\nThe results of the PSM calculations are compared with\nthe experimental data in Figs. 4 and 5. Figure 4 shows the\ntypical cranking model representation, i.e., the moment of\ninertia versus the rotational frequency. For the positive parity\nyrast band, the two backbendings in the moment of inertia\nare very well reproduced. There is an important change of\nstructure above the 14+ state, as indicated by the absence of\nthe 16+\u219214+ E2 transition, which is replaced by a cascade\nof two M1 transitions (Fig. 1).\nThe detailed analysis of the PSM results shows that the\nfirst backbending in the moment of inertia is attributed to the\nband-crossing of the neutron 2-qp band (K=1, from coupling\ntwo g9\/2 neutrons having K=5\/2 and 7\/2) with the 0-qp\nground band. Thus, the crossing, occurring between I=4 and\n6, corresponds to the alignment of two g9\/2 neutrons. Be-\ntween I=10 and 12, the results indicate another band-\ncrossing of this neutron 2-qp band with a 4-qp band consist-\ning of two g9\/2 neutrons and two g9\/2 protons. This\ncorresponds to the alignment of a pair of g9\/2 neutrons fol-\nlowed by that of the g9\/2 protons, and explains the observed\nsecond backbending in the moment of inertia. The observed\n13+ and 15+ states are also reasonably well predicted in en-\nergy. As seen in Fig. 5, the calculations predict another band-\nlike structure based on a K=12 state which, in the region of\nspins 12 to 15 is rather close in energy with the states from\nthe yrast band. However, there is no important mixing be-\ntween the states of this band and those of the yrast band.\nThe lower part of the band tentatively assigned as a nega-\ntive parity one, is also well described by the PSM calcula-\ntions, which predict a K=5 band starting around the correct\nexcitation energy (Fig. 5), whose backbending compares\nwell with the experimental one (Fig. 4). The detailed analysis\nshows that before the backbending this band has a proton\n2-qp structure, while after the backbending, its structure\nchanges to a 4-qp one. The proton 2-qp state is mainly a K\n=5 one (coupling of one g9\/2 proton having K=5\/2 and one\nf5\/2 proton having K=5\/2). It is however strongly mixed\nwith another proton 2-qp state with K=6 (coupling of one\ng9\/2 proton having K=7\/2 and one f5\/2 proton having K\n=5\/2). Galindo et al. [8] predicted a negative parity band in\n90Ru having the bandhead at I=4 and about 3.2 MeV. This\nmust be a different band compared to our results since the\nf5\/2 subshell was not considered in their model space. Con-\ncerning the 4-qp state configuration after the backbending,\nthe calculations indicate a structure having a neutron g9\/2 pair\nadded to the proton 2-qp state. Thus, the observed backbend-\nFIG. 4. Comparison of experimental kinematic moments of in-\nertia of 90Ru band structures with the results of the projected shell\nmodel calculations.\nFIG. 5.

The band-\nhead of this high-K band intrudes into the K=5 band se-\nquence and the states appear even lower in energy for I\n=13 and beyond.\nC. A note on high-K states\nIn the present PSM calculations, a K=6 2-qp state is pre-\ndicted particularly low in excitation energy. The state, having\nIp=6+, is predicted to lie at 2.38 MeV in excitation (Fig. 5).\nThe structure of this state is the neutron 2-qp state coupled to\ntwo g9\/2 neutrons having K=5\/2 and 7\/2. It is worth point-\ning out that these two g9\/2 neutrons, when coupled to K=1,\nare responsible for the observed backbendings (Fig. 4), as\ndiscussed in the previous section. Prediction for this K=6\nisomer in some other N,Z nuclei in the A,80\u201390 mass\nregion was given in [20]. Above the 7+ state, the states be-\nlonging to this K=6 structure are quite far from the yrast\nregion.\nThe PSM calculations indicate that in 90Ru certain 4-qp\nhigh-K states can also appear very close to the yrast line. Our\ncalculations show that the predicted K=11, Ip=11\u2212 state\n(shown in the previous section) has an excitation energy of\n5.13 MeV. It has a main structure which involves the two\nprotons that make the negative parity K=5 band and a K\n=6 pair of g9\/2 neutrons. Another 4-qp state appearing from\nthe calculation has positive parity, and is predicted to lie at\nan excitation energy of 4.98 MeV, about 300 keV above the\nyrast line (Fig. 5). This K=12, Ip=12+ state has a structure of\na pair of K=6 g9\/2 neutrons plus a pair of K=6 g9\/2 protons.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have reported new experimental data for\n90Ru, as obtained with the reaction 40Ca+ 58Ni at 135 MeV.\nThe yrast band was extended to higher spin states, well be-\nyond the second backbending. Another band has been iden-\ntified for the first time and was tentatively assigned as having\nnegative parity. The observed structures were compared with\npredictions of the projected shell model. Possible occurrence\nof high-K isomers in this nucleus has been discussed.\nThe large amount of new experimental data in this mass\nregion has been awaiting extended theoretical work. Within\nthe spherical shell model framework, most of the early cal-\nculations were restricted in a very small space s1g9\/2 ,2p1\/2d.\nHowever, effects of the nearby orbitals such as p3\/2, f5\/2, d5\/2,\nand g7\/2 should be included to achieve a more comprehensive\npicture. At present, this is only possible through the use of a\ndeformed basis supplemented by angular momentum projec-\ntion. It is shown in this work that the projected shell model\ncan give a reasonable description for the 90Ru data through a\nmanageable amount of numerical effort. The prediction of\nhigh-K isomeric states in 90Ru should, however, be tested by\nfuture experiments, and possibly be compared with spherical\nshell model calculations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the support received within the Euro-\npean Contract No. HPRI-CT-1999-00083 - V Framework\nProgramme.
