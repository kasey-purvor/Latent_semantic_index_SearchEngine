This is due to the combined effect of low speed \nand heavy loads that generate insufficient centrifugal force to churn the grease between \nthe rollers and the raceways. In addition, high pressures between the rolling elements and \nstationary raceway force grease out from the working surfaces. As a result of this \nphenomena, the service life of the bearing is severely reduced. \n \nAlso, lubrication properties of grease deteriorate with time as a result of mechanical \nworking and ageing. In addition, all lubricants become contaminated in service and must \ntherefore be replenished or changed from time to time. For very low-rotational speed \nbearings it is advisable to completely fill the bearing housing with grease in order to \nensure that the bearing components are properly and adequately lubricated, and to protect \nagainst corrosion [1]. For all the above reasons, accessing the quality and quantity of \nlubricant within the bearing housing is vital in ensuring prolonged service life.  \n \n \nThe aim of this research was to develop a suitable non-intrusive technique to determine \nfirstly, whether sufficient grease is present in a low-speed rotating bearing. Secondly, to \nascertain if the appropriate grade of grease is being employed. Both of these aims were \nachieved by measuring the transmissibility of stress wave (SW) signatures across the \nworking surfaces and elements of the bearing. This involved exciting the target bearing \nwith a Dirac pulse via a stress wave transducer, and extracting features from the response \nsignature captured by a second SW transducer. Several researchers  [2,3,4,5,6] have used \na similar technique, the acousto-ultrasonic technique, to evaluate material characteristics \n   \nand to identify defects in a material. This technique has been slightly modified for this \nresearch in order to study the transmissibility of stress waves across interfaces in low \nspeed bearings. \n \nAcoustic emissions and stress waves are normally defined as the elastic waves generated \nby the release of energy from defects within the microstructure of a material. The authors \nconsidered the above definition to be suitable for application in non-destructive testing \nand would like to define stress waves as the transient elastic waves generated by the \ninteraction of two surfaces that are in relative movement to each other. This definition is \nmore suitable for the application of stress waves in the area of machine condition \nmonitoring. The frequencies associated with the stress wave activity are above the human \nhearing threshold and cover a broad frequency range of  between 20KHz to several mega-\nHertz. In application to rolling element bearings, the interaction of surface asperities at \nthe working face of bearing components, and, interaction between defects and mating \nsurfaces will result in the generation of stress waves. Therefore, the ability to detect stress \nwaves can be utilised as an effective monitoring technique, not only for defect detection, \nbut as this paper reports, for determining the lubricating condition in a low-speed rolling \nelement bearing.  \n \nThe water industry extensively employs low-speed bearings, particularly on Rotating \nBiological Contactors (RBC) used for sewage treatment [7,8]. The RBC usually operates \nwith an extremely low rotating speed of between 0.6 RPM and 1.2 RPM. This research \noriginated due to severe bearing failures on RBC\u2019s and the system developed was to be \napplied on operational units. \n2.0  Lubrication mechanism in a low-speed rolling element bearings \n   \n \n2.1 Calculation of film thickness of a low-speed bearing based on the Elastro-\nhyrodyamnic lubrication (EHL) approach \n \nThe lubricant condition within a bearing can be described by the lubricant specific film \nthickness \u03bb, which is a measure of the degree of separation between rolling elements and \nraceways. When \u03bb is less than 3 to 4, incidental metal to metal contact occurs and this \nleads to a reduced bearing life. Bearing wear and friction are also related to the lubricant \nspecific film thickness [9]. ESDU [10] recommends that rolling bearings should operate \nwith \u03bb values of around 1, which is sufficient to ensure that the required basic rating life \nis achievable. Two empirical equations for calculating the lubricant film thickness are \npresented in this work, ESDU [10] and Hamrock and Jacobson [11]. An approximate \nformula developed by ESDU [10] for calculating the film thickness, h, which is \ndependent on load, modulus of elasticity and viscosity variation due to pressure, is given \nby:  \n  h=2.65 13.003.0\n43.054.07.07.0\n)'(\n)( 0\nsWE\nRu \u03b1\u03b7      (1) \n \nwhereas Hamrock and Jacobson [11] concluded that \n \n11.057.071.007.3 \u2212= WGU\nR\nh      (2) \nwhere \nU = dimensionless speed parameter, \nRE\nu\n'\n\u03b7  \nG = dimensionless materials parameter, 'E\u03b1  \n   \nW = dimensionless load parameter, \nRE\nWs\n'\n  \n   h    = minimum lubricant film thickness \n  Ws = load applied per unit width of contact \n   u  = lubricant entraining velocity \n   R  = effective radius of curvature \n   E\u2019 = effective modulus of elasticity \n\u03b7o = lubricant dynamic viscosity at atmospheric pressure and at operating \ntemperature. \n   \u03b7 = dynamic viscosity \n\u03b1 = pressure exponent of lubricant viscosity \nSolving for the film thickness, h, yields [11]: \n  h=3.07 11.003.0\n4.057.071.071.0\n)'(\n)(\nsWE\nRu \u03b1\u03b7\n     (3) \n \nA detailed description of the determination of parameters Ws u, R and E\u2019 is given in \nESDU [10]. The degree of surface asperity contact can be expressed by the ratio of the \nminimum thickness, h, to the combined roughness Rqt, known as the specific film \nthickness or lambda ratio, \u03bb, where  \n   \u03bb=\nqtR\nh   \nValues for the combined surface roughness, Rqt, of typical rolling bearing finishes can \nalso be obtained from ESDU [10]. \n \nThe technical specifications of the test bearing used for the calculation of the film \nthickness is shown in table 1. Two types of grease were employed for calculations, grease \n   \ntypes A and B. Properties are detailed in table 2. Grease A is a general application grease \nwhile grease B is formulated specifically for slow rotating machinery.  \n \n \nTable 1:  The test bearing, split cooper, technical specifications \n \n \nBearing type:  Split Cooper bearing Series 01B65 EX \nInternal diameter, d: 65 mm \nExternal diameter, D: 114.30 mm \nStatic load rating, LS 110 kN \nLength of the roller, l: 19.05 mm \nDiameter of the roller, rd: 14.287 mm \nNumber of roller, Z: 12 \n \nTable 2:  Properties of the lubricants used in the study \n \nLubricant Kinematic viscosity,\nmm2\/s at 40oC \nPressure exponent of \nviscosity, \n10-9 m2\/N \nDensity, \nkg\/m3 \nGrease A  180 25 \n(16) \n880 \n(16) \nGrease B 1000 25 \n(16) \n880 \n(16) \nOil 77.1 - - \n \nThe properties of the lubricants shown in Table 2 together with equations 1, 2 and 3 were \nused to determine the film and specific film thickness for each lubricant. These \n   \ncalculations were applied for a fixed load of 59.20 KN, which is slightly higher than the \ndesigned load of the test bearing, 55.00 KN. The results are presented in table 3 which \nshows that the calculated film thickness is in the range of nano-meters, confirming that a \nlow-speed rolling element bearing is lubricated by a thin film. The tables also show that \ngrease type B provides a much thicker film than type A. This is due to the fact that grease \ntype B has a higher kinematic viscosity. These calculations show that the film thickness \nfor a very low-speed rolling element bearing is dependent on the viscosity of the lubricant \nemployed. \n \nTable 3 shows that the values of specific film thickness, \u03bb, are much lower than the \nrecommended value of 1 [10, 11], suggesting that metal-to-metal contact would be \nexperienced at low rotational speeds.  \nTable 3: Results of the film and specific film thickness calculation for all the \nlubricant \n \nLubricant Film thickness \nx 10-9 m \nSpecific film thickness \n\u03bb \n ESDU (16) Hamrock and \nJacobson (17) \nESDU (16) Hamrock and \nJacobson (17) \nGrease A 8.8320 8.5773 0.0245 0.0238 \nGrease B 29.3335 28.9806 0.0815 0.0805 \n \n \n2.2  Thin Film Lubrication \n \nSince the calculated film thickness for the test bearing is in the range of nano-meters, the \nlubrication regime between the rolling elements and the raceways of the low-speed \n   \nbearing can be classified as thin film lubrication (TFL). Several researchers \n[12,13,14,15,16,17,18] have studied the thin film lubrication mechanism. Jang and Tichy \n[16] define the thin film lubrication regime as that in which the film thickness is of the \nsame order as the molecular scale of the lubricant, that is in the region of nano-meters. \nThe lubricant molecular scale is approximately in the region of 1 nano-meter compared to \nthe roughness height of high quality bearing or gear surfaces, approximately 25 nano-\nmeters. These observations suggest that bearings at low rotational speeds will be prone to \nearly loss of mechanical integrity. \n \n3.0  Experimental Technique, Procedure and Apparatus \n \nThe propagation of surface waves at interfaces is similar to pressure waves transmitted \nacross two surfaces in contact. However, as the surface asperities are quite rough, only \npart of the surface area is actually in contact. As stress is a force per unit area, the actual \narea transmitting force is very small. If the microscopic gaps between asperity contact \npoints are filled with a liquid, the pressure will be uniformly transferred between the \nsurfaces. Since the propagation of stress waves across interfaces is dependent on the \ntransmissibility of the couplant\/liquid and amount of surface contact, this phenomenon \ncan be utilised as a tool to monitor and identify the presence of a lubricant between \nworking faces of a low-speed rolling element bearing. If stress waves are forced to \npropagate through these interfaces, and the resultant energy of the stress waves measured, \nthese results could be related to the lubrication condition in the bearing. It is expected that \na properly lubricated bearing element will transmit more energy of a SW compared to a \npoorly lubricated bearing, as there would be more contact between asperity points and the \nlubricant. \n   \n \nA preliminary study was undertaken on the propagation characteristics of stress waves \nacross interfaces. The study involved transmitting a stress wave across two steel blocks \nwith differing lubricants between the blocks. A further test was also undertaken where a \nsteel beam replaced one of the blocks detailed above. This second test was undertaken \nfirstly, for authentication, but also to assess the effects of a long transmission path on the \nSW for different lubricant types.  The results of this initial study were applied in \nassessing the lubricating condition of a low-speed rolling element test bearing. \n \n3.1  Preliminary tests of stress wave propagation across an interface \n \nThe purpose of the preliminary tests was to study the transmissibility characteristic \npossessed by oil and types A and B grease, through an interface. Type A grease is a \ngeneral application grease whilst type B grease is formulated specifically for slow-speed \nrotating machinery. Weighing the grease and oil for all tests ensured repeatability. \n \n3.1.1  Stress wave propagation through two test blocks  \n \nA schematic diagram of the test blocks arrangement is shown in figure 1 (a) and a \nphotograph in figure 1 (b). The size of each steel block was 50mm (length) x 40mm \n(width) x 25mm (thickness). Three types of lubricant were used in this study and all their \nproperties have been detailed in table 2. For each test, 0.75 grams of a lubricant was \nspread evenly on one of the tests blocks. The lubricant was weighed using PAG Oerlikon \nweighing equipment type 250-9320 capable of weighing between 0.000g and 500.000g. \n \n   \n \nFigure 1 (a): Schematic diagram of the test blocks arrangement for the PIT \ntechnique. \n \n \nFigure 1 (b): End view of test blocks arrangement for the PIT technique. \n \nThe data acquisition system consisted of a Physical Acoustic Corporation (PAC) broad \nband AE transducer, model number WD\/AD35. Amplification was provided with the use \nof a PAC pre-amplifier type 1220A and a post-amplifier, type AE1A. A dual channel \nMagnetic \nclamps Steel blocks \n   \nAnalogue-to-Digital (ADC) converter from Rapid Systems (type R2000) was used for \ndata acquisition whilst and a Hewlett Packard model 8111A signal generator was \nemployed to generate a Dirac pulse. \n \nThe transducers were attached to the steel blocks using a magnetic clamp to obtain \nuniform force throughout the tests. The type B grease was used as the couplant for both \nthe transmitting and receiving transducer. Both transducers and magnetic clamps were \nleft undisturbed throughout the tests. Finally, the signal generator was used to input a \nDirac pulse with an amplitude of 5.0 volts and a bandwidth of 100 nano-seconds via one \nof the transducers. The resultant signature was captured at a sampling rate of 20MHz.  \n \n3.1.2  Stress wave propagation through a long steel beam  \n \nA schematic diagram of the beam-block test arrangement is shown in figure 2 (a) and a \nphotograph in figure 2 (b). The size of the steel beam was 1200mm (length) x 30mm \n(width) x 15mm (thick). Again, the transducer was attached to the top of the steel beam \nusing a magnetic clamp in order to maintain a consistent clamp force throughout the tests. \nThe magnetic clamps and the transducers were left undisturbed throughout the tests. A \nDirac pulse with an amplitude of 8.0 volts and a bandwidth of 100 nano-seconds was \nused to excite the steel beam via a SW transducer. \n \n \n \n   \n \nFigure 2 (a): Schematic diagram of the steel block and beam arrangement for PIT \ntechnique. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 (b): Picture of the steel block and beam arrangement for PIT technique \n \n \n \n \n   \n3.2  Application of stress wave propagation test on the test-rig \n \n3.2.1 Test-rig \n \nA photograph of the test rig is shown in figure 3 (a) and a schematic in figure 3 (b). The \nmain components of the test rig consist of a motor\/gearbox system, two support bearings \nacting as slave bearings, the test bearing and hydraulic cylinder ram. The test bearing was \na spherical roller bearing selected from a split Cooper bearing. This type of bearing was \nselected as it is commonly used on RBC\u2019s. The test rig was driven by an electric motor \nvia a gear box system The motor\/gear box system was a KA96R62 Helical-Bevel geared \nmotor, providing a rotational speed of 1.12rev\/min. Load was applied to the test bearing \nvia a hydraulic cylinder ram supported by a \u2018H\u2019 frame. Identical loads were applied on all \ntests. \n \n \nFigure 3 (a)  Photograph of the test-rig  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 (b) Schematic diagram of the test-rig \n \n3.2.2  Pulse injection technique (PIT)  \n \nThe pulse injection technique (PIT) was conducted on the test-rig by transmitting a Dirac \npulse via a stress wave transducer attached at the centre of the shaft as shown in figures \n3(a) and 3(b). The pulse was transmitted while the shaft was rotating and measurements \nwere obtained for several rotations of the shaft. The pulse was transmitted at regular \nintervals\/positions during one complete revolution, namely a quarter turn (90\u00b0), one half \n(180\u00b0), three quarter (270\u00b0) and full (360\u00b0) rotation of the shaft. To avoid recording any \nbackground noise originating from inside the bearing, the acquisition system was put on \n\u2018hold\u2019 in-between pulse transmissions. The response of the test bearing due to the pulse \nwas captured using a second stress wave transducer attached on the test bearing housing. \n540mm \n280mm 180mm \n510m\n610m\nm\n \n300m\nm\n \n140mm \n410mm \nEND VIEW \nSIDE VIEW \nTest bearing \nX \nX :- Position of transmitting SW \ntransducer\n   \nThe authors believe that this technique has not been used before to study the condition of \nlubricant inside a bearing.  \n \nVarious grease filling\/capacity conditions were simulated for these tests. This involved \nfilling the test bearing with the grease up to \u2018full\u2019, \u2018half full\u2019, a \u2018quarter full\u2019 and \u2018one-\neight full\u2019 capacity. Weighing the grease identified the filling capacity of the test bearing. \nThe application of oil was achieved by manually spreading oil onto the bearing \ncomponents.  \n \nA Dirac pulse of 100 nano-sec bandwidth and amplitude of 16.5 volts was transmitted to \nthe test bearing. This type of pulse was selected as its frequency response is flat over the \nfrequency range of the stress wave sensors employed (100KHz to 1.2MHz). A pulse was \ntransmitted to the test bearing for each grease type and grease capacity, in order to study \nthe effect of the amount and type of grease inside the test bearing on the resultant stress \nwave signature. Before exciting the test bearing, it was allowed to rotate for about 15 \nminutes, ensuring an even distribution of lubricant within the bearing. \n \n4.0  Experimental Results and Discussion \n \n4.1  Signal Processing Technique \n \nThe recorded signatures had to be classified so as to identify the type of grease employed \nand the amount of grease inside the bearing. The process of feature extraction involved \nsimple time series features for observing changes in signature strength, RMS, peak \namplitude and energy.  \n   \n \nIt was thought prudent to establish a more robust technique for classifying and grouping \nsignatures based on the effects of the transmission paths. The philosophy behind this was \nthat the interpretation of parameters such as amplitude, RMS and energy of SW \nsignatures from operational bearings might not necessarily indicate the condition of the \nlubricant within the bearing. This could be the case where levels of background noise, \nwhich will vary from one bearing to another, could mask out SW signatures produced by \nthe PIT; therefore, determination of lubricant condition would be impossible. Mba et. al. \n[7,8] have shown that transmission paths can aid in source location of SW signatures by \nclassification of Auto-Regressive (AR) coefficients associated with each SW. As it is \nanticipated that the effect of the lubricant transmissibility will affect the transmission \ncharacteristics, and thus signature shape, the technique of classification based on an AR \nmodel was undertaken.  \n \nOksa [19] and Mba et.al. [7] showed that the shape of a burst can be represented by a few \nAuto-Regressive (AR) coefficients. Auto-Regressive modeling has been detailed by Kay \net al [20] and Makhoul [21] and the computation of AR coefficients is derived from linear \nprediction [22]. To aid fault\/source identification, a clustering process that grouped the \nAR coefficients associated with each SW signature was employed. This is a hierarchical \ntechnique that measures the Euclidean distances between the centroid value of the AR \ncoefficients associated with each signature. Initially the coefficients with the minimum \ndistance are grouped together. Next, the group\u2019s centroid position is recalculated, and the \nAR coefficients with the minimum distance to the newly formed group are clustered with \nit. This procedure is repeated every-time a component is added to the cluster until all the \ncomponents are grouped. The results of classification were represented graphically using \n   \nan agglomerate dendrogram plot [23] in which individual signals are labelled on the y-\naxis whilst the distance between the centroids of clusters are shown on the x-axis.   \n \n4.2 Results :- PIT for the steel blocks \n \nTypical stress wave signatures transmitted across the steel blocks when lubricated by \ngrease types A, B, oil and under dry condition are shown in figures 4 (a) to 4 (d) \nrespectively. The figures show two signatures for each lubricant condition, indicating \nclearly the repeatability and consistency of the acquired results. \n \nAmplitude, RMS and energy features were extracted for each signature and the results are \ndetailed in table 4. Clearly, type B grease provided the best transmissibility across  \ninterfaces for the input stress waves. Based on the acquired results, it is evident that the \nhigher the lubricant viscosity, the stronger the resultant stress waves signal that can be \ntransmitted across an interface. \n \n   \n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime spectrum of blocks test, Grease A\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nx 10-4\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime, Sec\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime spectrum of blocks test, Grease B\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nx 10-4\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime,Sec\n \nFigure 4 (a-b): Typical stress waves signatures for steel block tests \n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime spectrum of blocks test, Oil\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nx 10-4\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime,Sec\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime spectrum of blocks test, Dry\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nx 10-4\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\nTime,Sec\n \nFigure 4 (c-d): Typical stress waves signatures for steel block tests \n   \n \nTable 4:  Averaged values of amplitude and energy for different lubricant used \nin PIT for the steel blocks \nLubricant Amplitude, rms \n(Volts) \nAmplitude, max \n(Volts) \nEnergy \n(Volts.msec) x 10-6 \nDry 0.0357 0.1012 0.9474 \nOil 0.2564 0.7700 24.6956 \nType A grease 0.2729 0.7560 36.9112 \nType B grease 0.3972 1.3920 46.463 \n \n \nFive signals from each type of lubricant were represented with a 10th order AR model. \nSelection of the model order was based on Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) and the \nforward prediction error (FPE) [20,21]. Figure 5 shows the results of the classification \nbased on the AR coefficients associated with SW\u2019s of each grease type. Every signature \nassociated with the lubricant condition is clearly displayed, for instance all five signatures \nassociated with grease type A are labelled \u2018a1\u2019 to \u2018a5\u2019. This method of numbering \nsignatures associated with a lubricant condition is undertaken throughout this paper. The \nresults of classification show that the signatures for the type B grease and dry condition \ncould be identified easily from lubricant types A and oil signatures. This indicates the \ncapability of the AR algorithm to characterise the stress wave signatures associated with \ndiffering lubricant viscosities. As lubricant type A and oil have similar viscosities in \nrelation to type B, it explains why they were grouped together. The classification results \nhave a similar trend with those obtained using the amplitude, RMS and energy analysis, \nas there is a clear distinction between type B grease and the dry condition, though type A \nand oil have similar results. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5:  Classification of the PIT signatures based on the AR coefficients, steel \nblocks test \n \n4.3  Results :-  PIT for the steel beam \n \nFigure 6 (a) to (d) show signatures associated with the steel beam block experiment.

Grouping of each lubricant is distinct and clearly \nvisible, though lubricants type A and oil are still closely related, evident by their close \ngrouping in figure 7. The reason for the clearer distinction between lubricants type A and \noil is attributed to the longer transmission paths to the receiving sensor, allowing more \npronounced effects of the lubricant viscosity on the stress wave signature.

Therefore, the \npropagation of a stress wave across the bearing will be sensitive to the different lubricant \ntransmissibility characteristics as indicated by the results of the steel beam arrangement. \n \nFigure 8 shows the resultant signatures for type B grease (capacity: - full) at shaft \npositions 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 of rotation. These signatures vary slightly for different \npositions of the shaft. This indicates that the position of the rolling elements inside the \nbearing housing has an effect on the transmission path of the input pulse. For instance, \nthere might not necessarily be a roller in the load region to provide a more direct \ntransmission path to the receiving SW transducer. In this case the transmission of the SW \nis dependent on the amount of lubrication within the bearing housing. For this reason it is \nexpected that there will be a variation in shape and characteristics (energy, amplitude, \nRMS) of the resultant signature. This highlights another potential drawback with \nextracting simple time series features (energy, .. etc.) and provides an adequate test for \nthe AR classification model.  \n   \n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n, V\nol\nts\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nx 10\n-4\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nTime, Seconds\n \nFigure 8: Resultant time waveform of the PIT for grease type B with full condition \nat the shaft position of 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. \n \nThe results of the time series analysis for both dry condition and oil lubrication are shown \nin table 6.

These show clearly that the amplitude and \nenergy levels decrease significantly with the amount of the type A grease inside the \n   \nbearing. Energy levels decrease by approximately 90% when the amount of the type A \ngrease was reduced from \u2018full\u2019 to \u2018half\u2019 full. In addition, the table also shows that the \namplitude and energy levels vary very slightly when the amount of the type A grease was \nreduced from half to one-eighth full condition. At filling capacities of a \u2018half\u2019, a \u2018quarter\u2019 \nand \u2018one-eight\u2019, the amplitude and energy levels of type A grease were only slightly \nhigher than the oil and dry lubricating conditions. Therefore, this result may indicate that \nthe type A grease loses most of its transmissibility when the amount of grease inside the \nbearing reduces to a half full. \n \nAlso, table 7 shows that the amplitude and energy levels of type B grease decrease \nuniformly and substantially when the capacity was reduced from \u2018full\u2019 to a \u2018quarter full\u2019 \ncondition. For example, the energy level decreases by approximately 74% when the \namount of type B grease was reduced from \u2018full\u2019 to \u2018half full\u2019 condition and from \u2018half \nfull\u2019 to a \u2018quarter full\u2019 condition.  Further reduction of the amount of grease does not \nsignificantly affect the amplitude and energy levels of the resultant signal. This may \nindicate that the type B grease loses most of its transmissibility when the amount of \ngrease inside the bearing reduces to a quarter full condition.  \n \nThese results demonstrate the superiority of the higher viscosity grease in providing \nbetter transmissibility across interfaces for the input stress waves at defined grease \ncapacity levels. This is in accordance with the result obtained from the preliminary tests \nusing steel blocks and beam, and indicates that lubricant viscosity plays a vital role in \ntransmitting stress waves for both static and dynamic systems.  \n \n   \nBoth types A and B greases show that the averaged amplitude and energy levels can be \nutilised as a measurement criteria to detect the amount of grease present in a low-speed \nbearing. The authors suggest that the energy level should be used as an indicator, since \nthere are significant changes in the energy level when the amount of grease in the bearing \nreduces from its full condition. Energy level can easily be used to alert the maintenance \nteam regarding the amount of grease left in the bearing. Therefore, a trending technique is \nsuggested to monitor the variation of the energy level of the resultant PIT signal over a \nperiod of time. Also, this parameter could be used to monitor the lubricant condition, i.e., \ndeterioration in viscosity. \n \nFigure 9 shows the results of the classification of the SW signatures associated with type \nA lubricant using AR coefficients. Four groups emerged after classification. The close-up \nviews of figure 9 are provided in figures 10 and 11. SW signatures associated with the \nfull capacity were grouped together, that is cluster 1 of figures 9 and 10. Signatures for \nthe other capacities, one half, one-quarter and one-eighth full were grouped together in \ntwo clusters, clusters 2 and 4. However, the dry condition was clearly grouped in cluster \nno. 3. These classifications correlate favourably with amplitude, energy and RMS \nfeatures detailed in table 7. There was a clear difference in extracted features (table 7) \nfrom a \u2018full\u2019 to \u2018half\u2019 full condition and this is mirrored in the classification results. Also, \nthe classification was able to differentiate and group signatures associated with the dry \ncondition. This demonstrates a clear distinction in signature shape between full, dry and \nother conditions. The cluster groups were determined by observing what signatures were \nclustered together, for instance, in figure 10, cluster 1, all signatures associated with the \nfull condition fell into this group, see labels on y axis. The notation 'f6\u2019 refers to SW \nsignature number 6 for a full grease capacity (note legend on figure). \n   \n \n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\nf5\nf6\nf7\nf8\nf9\nf10\nf11\nf12\nf13\nf14\nf15\nf16\nf17\nf18\nf19\n2f1\n2f2\n2f3\n2f4\n2f5\n2f6\n2f7\n2f8\n2f9\n2f10\n2f11\n2f12\n2f13\n2f14\n2f15\n2f16\n2f17\n2f18\n2f19\n2f20\n4f2\n4f3\n4f4\n4f5\n4f6\n4f7\n4f8\n4f9\n4f10\n4f11\n4f12\n4f13\n4f14\n4f15\n4f16\n4f17\n4f19\n4f20\n8f1\n8f2\n8f3\n8f4\n8f5\n8f6\n8f7\n8f8\n8f9\n8f10\n8f12\n8f13\n8f14\n8f15\n8f16\n8f17\n8f18\n8f19\n8f20\no1\no2\no3\no4\no5\no6\no7\no8\no9\no11\no12\no13\no14\no15\no16o17\no18\no19\nd1\nd2\nd3\nd4\nd5\nd6\nd7\nd8\nd9\nd10\nd11\nd12\nd13\nd14\nd15\nd16\nd17\nd18\nd19\nd20\nEuclidean distance between centroid values of AR coefficients associated with individual SW's\nClassification of PIT signatures using the centroid value of AR coefficients, Grease A\nCluster 1\nCluster 2\nCluster 3\nCluster 4\nSee figure 10 for close-up of clusters 1 and 2\nSee figure 11 for close-up of clusters 3 and 4\n \nFigure 9: Classification of all filling capacity, oil lubrication and dry condition \nsignatures based on AR technique, grease A. \n \n \n \n \n   \n-0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\nf5\nf6\nf7\nf8\nf9\nf10\nf11\nf12\nf13\nf14\nf15\nf16\nf17\nf18\nf19\nf20\n2f1\n2f2\n2f3\n2f10\n2f14\n2f16\n2f17\n2f18\n2f19\n2f20\n4f1\n4f4\n4f6\n4f16\n4f17\n4f18\n4f19\n8f1\n8f7\n8f8\n8f11\n8f13\n8f18\no1\no2\no3\no4\no5\no6\no7\no8\no9\no10\no11\no12\no13\no14\no15\no16\no17\no19\no20\nd18\nEuclidean distance between centroid values of AR coefficients associated with individual SW's\nClassification of PIT signatures using the centroid value of AR coefficients, Grease A\nCluster 1\nCluster 2 f - full\n2f - 1\/2full\n4f - 1\/4full\n8f - 1\/8full\no - oil\nd - dry\nCluster 2i:- mixture of oil and 1\/2-full grease capacity\nCluster 2ii:- mixture of 1\/4-  and 1\/2-full grease capacity\nCluster 2iii:- 1\/8-full grease capacity\nCluster  2iv:- Oil only\nGrease capacity within bearing\nFull grease capacity only\n \nFigure 10: Close-up view of clusters 1 and 2 of figure 9. \n \n   \n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n2f4\n2f5\n2f6\n2f7\n2f8\n2f9\n2f11\n2f1\n2f13\n2f15\n4f2\n4f3\n4f5\n4f7\n4f8\n4f9\n4f10\n4f11\n4f12\n4f13\n4f14\n4f15\n4f20\n8f2\n8f3\n8f\n8f5\n8f6\n8f9\n8f10\n8f12\n8f14\n8f15\n8f16\n8f1\n8f19\n8f20\no18\nd1\nd2\nd3\nd4\nd5\nd6\nd7\nd8\nd9\nd10\nd11\nd12\nd13\nd14\nd15\nd16\nd17\nd19\nd20\nEuclidean distance between centroid values of AR coefficients associated with individual SW's\nClassification of PIT signatures using the centroid value of AR coefficients, Grease A\nf - full\n2f - 1\/2full\n4f - 1\/4full\n8f - 1\/8full\no - oil\nd - dry\nGrease capacity within bearing\nDry bearing condition only\nCluster 4i:- mixture of 1\/4-  and 1\/2-full grease capacity\nCluster 4ii:- 1\/8-full grease capacity\nCluster 3\nCluster 4\n \nFigure 11: Close-up view of clusters 3 and 4 of figure 9. \n \nClassification of auto-regressive coefficients associated with type B grease is shown in \nfigure 12. The figure shows that the signals for each filling condition were clustered into \nthree main clusters. The close-up views of figure 12 are shown in figures 13 and 14. The \n\u2018full\u2019 and \u2018half\u2019-full signatures were grouped together in cluster 3 as shown in figure 14 \nand the rest of the groups, clusters 1 and 2, consisted of a mixture of all other conditions. \n \nThe results of classification indicate that as the condition of lubricant within the bearing \ndeteriorates, distinct groups become evident. Type A lubricant appears to lose its SW \ntransmissibility, and thus its lubrication effectiveness, as the capacity reduces from \u2018full\u2019 \nto \u2018half\u2019 full. However, type B only loses its effectiveness after the capacity has been \nreduced from \u2018half\u2019 full to a \u2018quarter\u2019 full. This suggests that the classification of AR \n   \ncoefficients associated with SW\u2019s has the capability of recognising and differentiating the \ntransmissibility characteristic provided by different amounts of grease.  \n \n \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\nf5\nf6\nf7\nf8\nf9\nf10\nf11\nf12\nf13\nf14\nf15\nf16\nf17\nf18\nf19\nf20\n2f1\n2f2\n2f3\n2f4\n2f5\n2f6\n2f7\n2f8\n2f9\n2f10\n2f11\n2f12\n2f13\n2f14\n2f15\n2f16\n2f17\n2f18\n2f19\n2f20\n4f1\n4f2\n4f3\n4f4\n4f5\n4f6\n4f7\n4f8\n4f9\n4f10\n4f11\n4f12\n4f13\n4f14\n4f15\n4f16\n4f17\n4f18\n4f19\n4f20\n8f1\n8f2\n8f3\n8f4\n8f5\n8f6\n8f7\n8f8\n8f9\n8f10\n8f11\n8f12\n8f13\n8f14\n8f15\n8f168f17\n8f18\n8f19\n8f20\nd1\nd2\nd3\nd4\nd5\nd6\nd7\nd8\nd9\nd10\nd11\nd12\nd13\nd14\nd15\nd16\nd17\nd18\nd19\nd20\no1\no2\no3\no4\no5\no6\no7\no8\no9\no10\no11\no12\no13\no14\no15\no16\no17\no18\no19\no20\nEuclidean distance between centroid values of AR coefficients associated with individual SW's\nClassification of PIT signatures using the centroid value of AR coefficients, Grease B\nCluster 1\nCluster 2\nCluster 3\nSee figure 13 for close-up of\n cluster 1\nSee figure 14 for close-up of\nclusters 2 and 3\n \nFigure 12: Classification of all filling capacity, oil lubrication and dry condition \nsignatures based on AR technique, grease B. \n   \n-0.05 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4\n4f1\n4f2\n4f3\n4f4\n4f5\n4f6\n4f7\n4f8\n4f9\n4f10\n4f11\n4f12\n4f13\n4f14\n4f15\n4f16\n4f17\n4f18\n4f19\n4f20\n8f2\n8f3\n8f4\n8f6\n8f7\n8f8\n8f9\n8f13\n8f14\n8f15\n8f16\n8f17\n8f19\n8f20\nd1\nd2\nd3\nd4\nd5\nd6\nd7\nd8\nd9\nd10\nd11\nd12\nd13\nd14\nd15\nd16\nd17\nd18\nd19\nd20\no1\no2\no3\no4\no5\no6\no7\no8\no9\no10\no11\no12\no13\no14\no15\no16\no18\no19\nEuclidean distance between centroid values of AR coefficients associated with individual SW's\nClassification of PIT signatures using the centroid value of AR coefficients, Grease B\nf - full\n2f - 1\/2full\n4f - 1\/4full\n8f - 1\/8full\no - oil\nd - dry\nGrease capacity within bearing\nCluster 1\nMixture of 1\/4-, 1\/8-full\ngrease capacity, oil and\n dry condition\n \nFigure 13: Close-up view of clusters 1 and 2 of figure 12. \n \n \n   \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\nf5\nf6\nf7\nf8\nf9\nf10\nf11\nf12\nf13\nf14\nf15\nf16\nf17\nf18\nf19\nf20\n2f1\n2f2\n2f3\n2f4\n2f5\n2f6\n2f7\n2f8\n2f9\n2f10\n2f11\n2f12\n2f13\n2f14\n2f15\n2f16\n2f17\n2f18\n2f19\n2f20\n8f1\n8f5\n8f10\n8f11\n8f12\n8f18\no17\no20\nEuclidean distance between centroid values of AR coefficients associated with individual SW's\nClassification of PIT signatures using the centroid value of AR coefficients, Grease B\nCluster 3\nMixture of full  and 1\/2-full grease capacity\nCluster 2\nMixture of 1\/8-full grease capacity and oil\nf - full\n2f - 1\/2full\n4f - 1\/4full\n8f - 1\/8full\no - oil\nd - dry\nGrease capacity within bearing\n \nFigure 14: Close-up view of clusters 3 and 4 of figure 12. \n \nThe successful grouping with AR coefficients, which mirrored results of RMS, amplitude \nand energy levels, proves that this method is not affected by slight changes in signature \nshape that could arise from varying positions of the rolling elements during acquisition. \nThis highlights the robustness of the method of AR feature extraction and grouping. \n \nIn order to utilise the energy analysis and AR algorithm to determine the amount of \ngrease inside a low speed bearing, baseline signatures for a full condition with fresh \ngrease is  required as a reference signal. The baseline data will then be used to trend the \nenergy level to identify any significant change in the amount of grease inside the bearing. \nIn addition, the baseline signatures will also be used in the classification process using the \nAR coefficients. \n   \n \nAfter a period of time, the viscosity of grease will reduce due to ageing and \ncontamination. Consequently, it is expected that the transmissibility capability of grease \nwill also reduce accordingly. This phenomenon is detectable with the pulse injection \ntechnique since the reduction in transmissibility will result in the reduction of energy \nlevels and changes in signature shape. \n \n5.0 Conclusion \n \nIt has been demonstrated that the transmutability of SW across interfaces is dependent on \nthe viscosity of the lubricant. Based on the results of this study, the pulse injection \ntechnique (PIT) has demonstrated its capability in assessing the amount of grease within a \nbearing housing, which is closely associated with the lubrication condition in the bearing. \nThis method is found to be effective due to the fact that the stress wave propagation is \nsensitive to the transmission path, which in turn is affected significantly by the type and \namount of grease present in the vicinity of the working elements of a bearing. Also, \nallowing SW signatures to travel over longer distances, after transmission across an \ninterface, will result in a more pronounced effect on the signature shape. \n \nTo the author\u2019s knowledge, this particular technique has never been used before to \ndetermine the amount of grease present inside a low-speed rolling element bearing. The \nPIT method has been specially developed for bearings used in a RBC in which the end \nshaft is accessible. However, the PIT technique can also be applied to other slow rotating \nmachinery provided that the end shaft is accessible and the shaft rotates at such a speed \nthat would allow the transmitting transducer to be mounted onto the rotating shaft. \n   \n6.0  References \n \n1 SKF general catalogue 1981, SKF, Sweden. \n2 Vary, A. 1982, Acousto-ultrasonic charaterization of fiber reinforced composite, \nMaterials evaluation, Vol 40, May 1982, pp 650-662. \n3 William Jr., J.H.
