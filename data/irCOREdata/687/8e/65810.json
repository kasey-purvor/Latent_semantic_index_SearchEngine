Strong experimental upper limits on the elec-\ntric charge of neutrons, atoms, and molecules [1, 2, 3],\nQ < O(10\u221221) e, with the magnitude of the electron elec-\ntric charge e, as well as on the magnetic moments of the\nneutrinos [4], \u00b5\u03bd < O(10\u221210)\u00b5B, with the Bohr mag-\nneton \u00b5B = e\/2me and the electron mass me, strongly\nsupport the idea that charge quantization is a funda-\nmental principle. However, the standard model of par-\nticle physics with three generations of quarks and lep-\ntons does not impose charge quantization [5]. One needs\nphysics beyond the standard model in order to enforce\nit, as is demonstrated by Dirac\u2019s seminal argument for\ncharge quantization based on the hypothetical existence\nof magnetic monopoles [6]. Whereas some extensions of\nthe standard model, e.g. grand unified theories, provide\nmechanisms for enforcing charge quantization, other pos-\nsible extensions suggest the existence of particles of small,\nunquantized charge Q\u01eb = \u01ebe, with \u01eb\u226a 1 [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nThere are a number of experimental and observational\nbounds on the fractional electric charge \u01eb and on the\nmass m\u01eb of hypothetical millicharged particles, coming\nfrom laboratory experiments, astrophysics and cosmol-\nogy [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] (for a recent review and\nfurther references, see Ref. [19]). In the sub-electron mass\nregion, m\u01eb < me, the best laboratory-based bounds on\nmillicharged fermions, \u01eb < O(10\u22124), come from searches\nfor the invisible decay of orthopositronium [20] and from\na comparison [19] of Lamb-shift measurements [21, 22]\nwith predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED) (cf.\nFig. 1). Stronger, albeit more model-dependent bounds\narise through astrophysical and cosmological considera-\ntions. For example, stellar evolution constraints [25] yield\na bound \u01eb < O(10\u221214), form\u01eb < O(10 keV), whereas suc-\ncessful big bang nucleosynthesis leads to the restriction\n\u01eb < O(10\u22129), for m\u01eb < O(1 MeV).\nIn the present Letter, we want to investigate whether\nsearches exploiting laser polarization experiments can\ngive competitive constraints on millicharged fermions,\nmost notably in comparison to other laboratory searches.\nFIG. 1: Laboratory-based upper limits on the fractional elec-\ntric charge \u01eb = Q\u01eb\/e of a hypothetical millicharged fermion\nof mass m\u01eb. The \u201cBeam dump\u201d limit has been derived\nin Ref. [13] from a beam-dump search for new neutrino-\nlike particles at SLAC [23, 24]. The \u201cOrthopositronium\u201d\nlimit stems from a limit on the branching fraction of invis-\nible orthopositronium decay [20]. The \u201cLamb shift\u201d limit\ncomes from a recent comparison [19] of Lamb shift measure-\nments [21, 22] with QED predictions. The \u201cBFRT dichro-\nism\/birefringence\u201d limit arises from the upper limit on vac-\nuum magnetic dichroism\/birefringence placed by the laser po-\nlarization experiment BFRT [36] (see text).\n2It is theoretically well established in QED that photon-\ninitiated electron-positron pair production, \u03b3 \u2192 e+e\u2212, in\nan external magnetic field [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,\n34, 35] manifests itself as a vacuum magnetic dichroism:\nthe polarization vector of an initially linearly polarized\nphoton beam with energy \u03c9 > 2me in general is rotated\nafter passing a transverse magnetic field. However, be-\ncause of its high threshold energy, this effect has not been\ndetected in the laboratory yet. Recent past, present day,\nand near future instruments for the detection of vacuum\nmagnetic birefringence and dichroism, such as BFRT [36],\nPVLAS [37], Q&A [38], BMV [39], and proposed ex-\nperiments at CERN [40] and in Jena [41] exploit pho-\nton beams with energies \u03c9 = O(eV). Correspondingly,\nthey may be sensitive to vacuum magnetic dichroism in-\nduced by the production of fermion anti-fermion pairs\nwith mass 2m\u01eb < \u03c9 = O(eV). Similarly, they may also\nbe sensitive to vacuum magnetic birefringence caused by\nthe virtual production of these light millicharged parti-\ncles, which induces ellipticity of the laser beam in the\nmagnetic field.\nLet us first consider dichroism. Let ~k be the momen-\ntum of the incoming photon, with |~k| = \u03c9, and let ~B be\na static homogeneous magnetic field, which is perpendic-\nular to ~k, as it is the case in all of the above-mentioned\npolarization experiments. The photon-initiated produc-\ntion of a Dirac-type fermion anti-fermion pair, with elec-\ntric charge Q\u01eb = \u01ebe and mass m\u01eb, at \u03c9 > 2m\u01eb, leads\nto a non-zero difference between the photon absorption\ncoefficients \u03ba\u2016 and \u03ba\u22a5, corresponding to photon polariza-\ntions parallel or perpendicular to ~B. The fact that the\nabsorption coefficients for the two polarizations, \u2016 and\n\u22a5, are different directly leads to dichroism: for a linearly\npolarized photon beam, the angle \u03b8 between the initial\npolarization vector and the magnetic field will change to\n\u03b8 + \u2206\u03b8 after passing a distance \u2113 through the magnetic\nfield, with\ncot(\u03b8 +\u2206\u03b8) =\nE\u2016\nE\u22a5\n=\nE0\u2016\nE0\u22a5\nexp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n(\u03ba\u2016 \u2212 \u03ba\u22a5)\u2113\n)\n. (1)\nHere, E\u2016,\u22a5 are the electric field components of the laser\nparallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field\nand the superscript \u201c0\u201d denotes initial values. For small\nrotation angle \u2206\u03b8, we have\n\u2206\u03b8 \u2243 1\n4\n(\u03ba\u2016 \u2212 \u03ba\u22a5)\u2113 sin(2\u03b8). (2)\nExplicit expressions for the photon absorption coeffi-\ncients \u03ba\u2016,\u22a5 can be inferred from the literature on \u03b3 \u2192\ne+e\u2212 in a homogeneous magnetic field [27, 28, 29, 30,\n31, 32, 33, 34, 35]:\n\u03ba\u2016,\u22a5\u2113 =\n1\n2\n\u01eb3e\u03b1\nB\u2113\nm\u01eb\nT\u2016,\u22a5(\u03c7) (3)\n= 1.09\u00d7 106 \u01eb3\n(\neV\nm\u01eb\n)(\nB\nT\n)(\n\u2113\nm\n)\nT\u2016,\u22a5(\u03c7),\nwhere \u03b1 = e2\/4\u03c0 is the fine-structure constant.

(5)\nThe above expression has been derived in leading order\nin an expansion for high frequency,\n\u03c9\n2m\u01eb\n\u226b 1, (6)\nand of high number of allowed Landau levels of the mil-\nlicharged particles,\nNLandau =\n1\n24\n(\n\u03c92\n\u01eb eB\n)2\n\u226b 1. (7a)\nLet us remark that expression (4) was originally de-\nrived in Ref. [33] in the more restrictive high-frequency\n\u03c9\/2m\u01eb \u226b 1 and weak-field limit \u01eb eB\/m2\u01eb \u226a 1, in agree-\nment with the results of Refs. [27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. These\nin turn agree with the result of Ref. [34] which are ob-\ntained with the conditions (6) and (7a). Intuitively, we\ncan understand the nature of this approximation as fol-\nlows. Expression (4) is a rather smooth function of the\nfrequency \u03c9. However, from the discrete nature of the\nLandau levels we would rather expect absorption peaks.\nYet, if the peaks are very dense we cannot resolve them\nand we have to average over a small frequency interval\n\u2206\u03c9, yielding the smooth function (4). Averaging is al-\nlowed if we have a large number of peaks \u2206Npeaks in the\ninterval \u2206\u03c9,\n\u2206Npeaks =\n1\n2\n\u2206NLandau =\n1\n12\n(\n\u03c92\n\u01eb eB\n)2\n\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u226b 1 (7b)\n\u21d4 \u01eb\u226a 4.89\u00d7 10\u22123\n( \u03c9\neV\n)2(T\nB\n)(\n\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c9\n) 1\n2\n.\nThis expression agrees with (7a) up to a factor of\n\u2206\u03c9\/(2\u03c9) which takes the uncertainty in the frequency\ninto account. In the above-mentioned laser polarization\nexperiments, a cavity is used to reflect the laser beam\nback and forth, thereby enhancing the signal. In that\n3case, the frequency uncertainty is \u2206\u03c9\/\u03c9 \u223c 1\/Nr, where\nNr is the number of reflections in the cavity.\nAt present, the most stringent bound on vacuum mag-\nnetic dichroism comes from the BFRT laser polarization\nexperiment [36]. A linearly polarized laser beam (\u03c9 =\n2.41 eV) was sent along the magnetic field of two super-\nconducting dipole magnets (B = 2 T), which were placed\nin an optical cavity with Nr = 254 reflections, such that\nthe optical path length was \u2113 = Nr \u00d7 8.8 m \u2243 2235 m.\nAn upper limit on the absolute value of the rotation,\n|\u2206\u03b8| < 6\u00d7 10\u221210 (95% confidence level), (8)\nwas obtained. This can be turned into an upper limit on\n\u01eb, as a function of m\u01eb, by exploiting the predictions (1)-\n(4) for \u2206\u03b8 from photon-initiated pair production of mil-\nlicharged fermions in an external magnetic field. The re-\nsulting limit is displayed in Fig. 1 and labelled as \u201cBFRT\ndichroism\u201d. Clearly, for small masses, m\u01eb . 0.1 eV,\nthis represents currently the best laboratory limit on mil-\nlicharged fermions.\nLet us now turn to birefringence. The propagation\nspeed of the laser photons is slightly changed in the mag-\nnetic field owing to the coupling to virtual charged pairs.\nThe corresponding refractive indices n\u2016,\u22a5 differ for the\ntwo polarization modes, causing a phase difference be-\ntween the two modes,\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03c9\u2113(n\u2016 \u2212 n\u22a5). (9)\nThis induces an ellipticity \u03c8 of the outgoing beam,\n|\u03c8| = \u03c9\u2113\n2\n|(n\u2016 \u2212 n\u22a5) sin(2\u03b8)| for \u03c8 \u226a 1. (10)\nVirtual production can occur even below threshold\n\u03c9 < 2m\u01eb. Therefore, we consider both high and low\nfrequencies.

The parameter values between\nthe two lines labelled \u201cPVLAS dichroism\u201d correspond to the\npreferred 95% confidence region if the PVLAS rotation is in-\nterpreted as orginating from pair production of millicharged\nfermions.

For\na check of the quantitative convergence of the underly-\ning expansion for m\u01eb . 10\n\u22122 eV, a next-to-leading order\ncalculation may ultimately be needed.\nRecently, the PVLAS collaboration reported the ob-\nservation of an optical rotation generated in vacuum by\na magnetic field [37],\n|\u2206\u03b8|\/Nr = (3.9\u00b1 0.5)\u00d7 10\u221212. (15)\nThe experimental parameters in their setup were \u03c9 =\n1.17 eV, B = 5 T, Nr = 4.4\u00d7 104, and \u2113 = Nr \u00d7 1 m. If\ninterpreted in terms of pair production of millicharged\nfermions, we obtain the preferred 95% confidence re-\ngion lying between the two black lines labelled \u201cPVLAS\ndichroism\u201d in Fig. 2. Apparently, at two standard devia-\ntions, this is in conflict with the limit from BFRT. Never-\ntheless, the PVLAS result is very close to the boundary\n4of the excluded region for masses O(0.1 eV), and there-\nfore the pair-production interpretation still represents a\nremote alternative to the standard, axion-like-particle\n(ALP) interpretation of the PVLAS result [43, 44]. For\nboth interpretations, there are problems with the as-\ntrophysical bounds [25] which are difficult to avoid for\nALPs [45, 46, 47, 48]. It remains to be seen whether\npair production provides easier ways to evade them.\nA promising way to test the parameter region around\nm\u01eb \u223c 0.1 eV, \u01eb \u223c 3\u00d7 10\u22126, opens up in the near future,\nwhen the sensitivity of searches for the invisible decay of\northopositronium reach the 10\u22129 level in the correspond-\ning branching ratio [49] (cf. Fig. 2). Also, a PVLAS\nbirefringence measurement can be expected to explore\nthe interesting region around m\u01eb \u223c 0.1 eV; a positive\nsignal would fix both parameters \u01eb and m\u01eb of hypothet-\nical millicharged particles by reading off the intersection\npoint of the dichroism and birefringence curves.\nIn summary, polarization measurements of laser beams\ntraversing intense magnetic fields provide a very sensitive\nprobe of light millicharged fermions in the laboratory. In\nthe sub-eV range, already the limits inferred from the\npioneering BFRT experiment are more than two orders\nof magnitude better than other laboratory based limits.\nAcknowledgments\nA.R. would like to thank Eduard Masso, Javier Re-\ndondo, Carlo Rizzo, and Giuseppe Ruoso for an inspiring\ndiscussion on electric charge quantization and neutrality\nof neutrons and atoms.
