INTRODUCTION\nLong-lived, highly excited isomers in deformed atomic\nnuclei owe their existence to the K quantum number @1#. The\nprojection K of the angular momentum on the nuclear sym-\nmetry axis is approximately conserved, leading to decays\nwith high DK being hindered and consequently, high-K iso-\nmers with half-lives that range from nanoseconds to years.\nThe A\u2019180 region of prolate-deformed nuclei is uniquely\nfavorable for studying the limits to the K quantum number\n@2# as several single-particle orbitals with large spin projec-\ntions V i are found close to the Fermi surface, for both neu-\ntrons and protons. These give rise to multiquasiparticle iso-\nmers with K5( iV i .Notable examples include a Kp5161,\nfour-quasiparticle isomer in 72\n178Hf, with t1\/2531 y @3#, and a\nKp5251, eight-quasiparticle isomer in 74178W, with t1\/2\n5220 ns @4#.\nThe decay of such K isomers requires K mixing, two con-\ntrasting modes of which are orientation fluctuations with\nfixed shape @5#, and shape fluctuations with fixed orientation\n@6#. Also, direct mixing due to chance degeneracies can play\na role. Despite these distinct physical scenarios, observables\nthat differentiate between them have proved elusive. The\npresent study of 75\n179Re forms part of a program to disentangle\nthese and other competing K-mixing mechanisms.\nFurther motivation emerged from the study of 179Re by\nVenkova et al. @7# who discovered two low-seniority iso-\nmers. Examination of the single-particle energies suggests\nthe possibility of higher seniority seven- and nine-\n*Corresponding author.

Here we report new results from a study\naimed at elucidating the high-spin structure and decay\nmechanisms in 179Re. Partial results of this work appear in\nthe Ph.D. thesis of Thwaites @8#.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nExcited states in 179Re were populated using the\n67\n165Ho(818O,4n) 75179Re and 70173Yb(511B,5n) 75179Re reactions. The\nbunched and chopped beams were provided by the ANU\n14UD Pelletron accelerator. The experimental conditions are\ndetailed in Table I. The targets for the g-ray measurements\nhad thicknesses of 3.75 mg cm22 with the natural abundance\nof 100% 165Ho and 5 mg cm22 of 173Yb enriched to 95%.\nThe data presented in this paper are mostly from the\n70\n173Yb( 511B,5n) 75179Re reaction, as this was found to populate\nstates with higher angular momenta.\nGamma-ray events were recorded by the Caesar array @9#,\ncomprising six Compton suppressed coaxial germanium de-\ntectors and two unsuppressed planar LEPS germanium detec-\ntors. The coaxial detectors were arranged at angles of 648\u00b0,\n697\u00b0, and 6145\u00b0 to the beam axis. The LEPS were placed at\n45\u00b0and 135\u00b0 in the horizontal plane. Energy and efficiency\ncalibrations were obtained using 152Eu and 133Ba radioactive\nsources.\nA. Gamma-ray coincidence analysis\nThe level scheme was constructed using g-g coinci-\ndences, building on earlier work @7#. From the initial experi-\nments evidence emerged for a weakly populated ;0.5-ms\nhigh-spin state. With the aim of establishing the properties\nand deexcitation route of this isomer, subsequent out-of-\nbeam measurements were undertaken ~see Table I!.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 66, 054309 ~2002!B. Conversion electron measurement\nOut-of-beam measurements of conversion electrons were\nalso taken in order to confirm or aid multipolarity assign-\nments for specific transitions in the decay path of the ;0.5\nms isomer. Both electrons and g rays were detected, timed\nrelative to the pulsed beam ~640 ms on, 5300 ms off! of 11B\non a 2.3 mg cm22 173Yb foil placed at 30\u00b0to the beam direc-\ntion. The electrons were detected with a cooled Si~Li! detec-\ntor located inside a superconducting solenoid operating in\nlens mode @10#. A 152Eu source was used to calibrate for\nenergy and efficiency in both electron and g-ray detectors.\nSeveral field limits were used in the lens-mode operation to\noptimize particular regions of the electron spectrum. These\nincluded conditions to accept electrons in the 200\u2013650-keV\nrange, and a fixed field case centered near the conversion\nlines from the 1272-keV transition, necessary because of its\nlow absolute intensity. For each arrangement, matrices of\nelectron energy vs time and g-ray energy vs time were con-\nstructed and gated to produce electron and g-ray spectra\nwhich could be manipulated to select the isomer decay and\nremove the intense activity lines. The complementary matri-\nces were used to provide an independent measure of the life-\ntime of the long isomer.\nC. Half-lives\nHalf-life information in the present study is obtained by\nexamining background subtracted time spectra obtained from\ng-time matrices. These measurements involve plotting the\nrelative time of the g-ray events with respect to the prompt\nbeam pulses, and were fitted with an exponential decay. This\ntechnique is suitable for spectra without a prompt lifetime\ncomponent. For shorter half-lives obtained from the g-time\nmatrices and for the time-difference spectra produced from\nthe g-g-Dt cube, the resulting spectra were fitted with a\nprompt-Gaussian function convoluted with an exponential\ndecay, a technique which is suitable for lifetimes in the nano-\nsecond regime, or longer-lived states coincident with a\nprompt response.\nFIG. 1. The top panel shows the total g-g projection, dominated\nby long-lived b decays, such as the 106- and 237-keV g-ray tran-\nsitions from 178Re13.2min .\u2192 178W. Bottom panel: projection of the\nsubtracted matrix ~see text for details!. The 179Re internal decays\n~labeled! are clearly visible.

When making spin and parity assignments, as dis-\ncussed in this section, the following criteria have been con-\nsidered.\nAll nonisomeric levels (t1\/2,1 ns) observed in the experi-\nments are assumed to decay by M1, E1, or E2 transitions.\nRelative g-ray intensities, for levels that deexcite by more\nthan one branch, can constrain assignments.\nFor transition energies below ;200 keV, intensity balanc-\ning can be used to determine total electron conversion coef-\nficients. Comparing these to theoretical values @11# enables\ndiscrimination between some multipolarities.\nSystematic features, such as transitions continuing a regu-\nlar rotational sequence, are also considered, but in the ab-\nsence of additional information the spins and parities of these\nlevels, as with all uncertain assignments, are given in paren-\ntheses. The K quantum number is used as a convenient label\nand is usually considered to be equal to the spin of the band-\nhead. This assumption is discussed in more detail in Sec. IV.\nTable II gives the energies and delayed ~out-of-beam!\ng-ray intensities of the transitions placed in the 179Re level\nscheme from this work, together with spin, parity, and band\nassignments.\nA. Kp\u02dc 52 \u00bf \u0084ground-state\u0085 band\nThe ground-state band has previously been observed up to\nIp5(35\/21) @7# with DI51 transitions identified as far as\n27\/2 \\ . Firm spin and parity assignments have been made up\nto the Ip533\/21 state @7#. Here, delayed feeding from higher\nspin states enters the band at the 25\/21 2252-keV level via\n304- and 367-keV transitions, at the 1714-keV 21\/21 state\nvia a 340-keV decay, and at the 19\/21 band member, fed by\na 616-keV transition. The relatively high intensity of the in-\ntraband transitions linking the lower spin states in the Kp\n55\/21 band ~e.g., the 124- and 156-keV transitions! sug-\ngests other, stronger routes may populate the levels below\nIp517\/21 from the 3160-keV state. Candidate transitions\nare discussed in Sec. III I.\nB. Kp\u02dc 12 \u00c0 band\nThe Ip55\/22 65-keV 95-ms isomer is the bandhead of a\ndecoupled one-quasiparticle band. The Ip51\/22 level lies at\n118 keV @12#. The cascade of DI52 decays has been iden-\ntified as far as 49\/22 at 5575 keV in this work, forming the\nyrast line up to at least spin 45\/2. This band is fed at spin\n29\/2 and 33\/2 by intense 1272- and 653-keV transitions, re-\nspectively, from a Kp5(31\/21) state elucidated in Sec.\nIII H.\nC. Kp\u02dc 92 \u00c0 band\nThe strongly coupled band built on a Kp59\/22 bandhead\nhas been established with firm spins and parities up to 39\/22\n@7,13# with DI51 g rays extending to Ip537\/22. However,\nuntil the present work, the excitation energy of this band\nwith respect to the ground state, together with the entire sec-\ntion of the level scheme incorporating the levels A and band\nC, was unknown. @Note that the Kp5(17\/21) band was not\npreviously known.# From the short delayed data ~collected9-3\nFIG. 2.

Feeding in to the known members of the Kp59\/22\nband above spin 19\/2 could not be ruled out in this study, and\nwould be consistent with the population intensity of the\n258.1- and 500.4-keV in-band transitions.\nD. Levels A\nThe 1298-keV level decays via three branches to the Kp\n59\/22 band, the most intense of which proceeds to the Ip\n515\/22 member with the remaining decays linking the\n13\/22 and 11\/22 states. In the short pulsing data the 728-\nand 1014-keV g rays to the 17\/2 and 13\/2 members of the\nKp51\/22 band, respectively, have been established. Note\nthat while the 728- and 1014-keV transitions were not ob-\nserved in the millisecond off-beam work due to the lower\n~isomeric! population intensity for this part of the decay\nscheme, these two transitions are included in Fig. 2 because\nof their pivotal role in establishing the excitation energy of\nthe Kp59\/22 band and connected structures.

The new 2694- and 3253-keV states assigned to band\nB in the present work are assumed to be fed by an unob-\nserved 25-keV transition from the Kp5(31\/21) level at\n3277 keV. This is based on coincidence relations between\ntransitions in band B and higher lying g rays. The decay of\nthe 1826-keV bandhead to the 1772-keV Kp519\/22 level\n~via an unobserved 54-keV transition, not shown in Fig. 2!,\ntogether with the 206-keV transition and feeding from higher\nstates suggests possible spins and parities of Kp519\/21\/2\nand 17\/21\/2. The tentative Kp5(19\/21) assignment, chosen\nhere for band B, is based on the absence of decays to the\nKp515\/22 state at 1298 keV. The weak population of band\nB is consistent with its nonyrast status ~see Fig. 5!. No infor-\nmation about the half-life of the 1826-keV bandhead could\nbe obtained in this work due to its insufficient statistics. The\nlevel is reported to be isomeric by Venkova et al. @7#, but\nthey could not determine the half-life due to the low intensity\nof the transitions during the in-beam work.\nG. Band C\nThe Kp5(19\/22) level at 1772 keV is fed by an isomeric\nintrinsic state whose half-life is determined to be 408612 ns.\nThis half-life is shown in Fig. 6. Note that Venkova et al. @7#\nshowed that a .0.4 ms half-life was associated with band-\nhead C rather than the 1772-keV state by means of a time-\ndifference analysis. The direct decay from the isomer has not\nbeen observed, but Venkova et al. @7# indicated that the en-\nergy should be &140 keV. The tentative Kp5(23\/21) as-\nsignment was made @7# considering energy systematics and\ncomparing the half-life to the Weisskopf single-particle esti-\nmate. The first four DI51 transitions are observed here,\npopulated by an unidentified route ~marked as \u2018\u2018?\u2019\u2019 in Fig. 2!\nfrom the Kp5(31\/21) level.

In addition, E2 character\nfor the 1272-keV g ray combined with the determination of\nthe 178-keV transition, depopulating band E, as M1 ~see\nSec.

Levels D\nThe 2053-keV state shown in Fig. 2 feeds the Kp55\/21\nground-state band via 340- and 616-keV transitions to the\n21\/2 and 19\/2 members, respectively. The higher intensity of\nthe 340-keV transition suggests an Ip5(23\/2)1 assignment,\nbut a spin and parity of 21\/21 cannot be ruled out. The\n2053-keV level is considered rotational rather than intrinsic\ndue to the observation of a regular g-ray cascade of 502, 441,\nand 377 keV, in coincidence with the 565-keV and higher\nlying transitions. These are not included in the decay scheme\nof Fig. 2 as their connection to the Kp55\/21 band could not\nbe established. These transitions, together with the 565-keV\ndecay, are considered as candidates for a signature sequence\nof stretched E2 radiation, and are coincident with ~at least!\nthe 124 keV 7\/21\u21925\/21 g ray in the ground-state band. This\nis the basis for the tentative Ip5(27\/21) assignment for the\n2619-keV level. In Fig. 8 ~top! the 119- and 294-keV transi-\ntions remain unplaced, partly due to their close proximity to\nother transitions. These two decays are also candidates for\nthe missing link between levels D and the ground-state band.\nThe three levels ~D! at excitation energies of 2556, 2619,\nand 2634 keV have similar population strengths and, in the\ncase of the 2556- and 2619-keV levels, de-excite by g-ray\ntransitions to the 25\/21 member of the ground-state band.\nThus all three states are assigned Ip5(27\/2)1. The Kp\n5(31\/21) intrinsic level has a strong branch to the 3160-\nkeV state via a 117-keV transition with a preferred M1 as-\nsignment from the intensity balancing discussed in Sec. III H\nabove. Together with the observation of the 296-keV transi-\ntion from the 3456-keV level in band E to the 3160-keV state\nin levels D, this means that the possible assignments for the\n3160-keV state are Kp5(29\/2)1, (31\/2)1, and (31\/2)2.-10\nPERSISTENCE OF K ISOMERISM IN THE N5104 . . .

M1 transition when the favor assign-\nment of Kp5(31\/21) is considered for the 3277-keV state.\nThe loss of intensity across this 3160-keV state in the coin-\ncidence analysis, suggests that there may be other, unob-\nserved decay paths depopulating this level. The half-life limit\nfor the 3160-keV level is t1\/2,1 ns.\nJ. Band E\nBand E is the most strongly populated sequence in the\ndecay of the high-seniority isomer. The electron-\nspectroscopy measurement has established the 310-, 314-,\n318-, 322-, 330-, and 340-keV transitions in band E as pre-\ndominantly of M1 character, with accompanying E2 cross-\nover transitions also identified. The results are shown in\nTable III.

This\nis consistent only with M1 character @aT(M1)51.05,\naT(E1)50.09, and aT(E2)50.48 @11##, leading to a Kp\n5(33\/21) assignment for band E. ~For an unstretched 178-\nkeV M1 transition, a competing dipole decay from the 3766-\nkeV state would be possible.! The excited states belonging to\nband E have been observed up to Ip5(45\/21).

IV B.\nA 165-keV decay is in coincidence with transitions band\nF. A large uncertainty on the conversion coefficient from\nintensity balancing due to the presence of other transitions\nwith close lying energies means that only an M1 decay can\nbe discarded. The E1 assignment attributed to this decay is\nfavored by the resulting E2 feeding transitions to bands E, F,\nand G, from the ;0.5-ms isomer. A more in-depth study of\nthis is described in Secs. III M and IV E. The resulting as-\nsignment is an uncertain Ip5(45\/21) for the 5352-keV state\nwhich could be either intrinsic, or a rotational level decaying\nout of band. This state is fed by the ;0.5 ms isomer. The\n165- and 265-keV transitions are in coincidence with each\nother and all members in the band. Their placement above or\nbelow the band is uncertain.\nL. Band G\nThe third structure to be populated from the de-excitation\nof the ;0.5-ms state is band G. Again, only a preliminary\nassignment was possible for these levels as there are only\nthree regular energies, with ~possibly two! associated cross-\nover transitions. The bandhead assignment of Kp5(35\/21)\nhas been selected due to the large g factor expressed by the\nstrong DI51 in-band transitions compared to the very weak\nDI52 decays.

This has influenced the place-\nment of the 426-keV decay from the bottom of band G to the\nKp5(31\/21) level. In the absence of other spectroscopic\ninformation, provisional dipole assignments are chosen for\nall three transitions without accompanying crossover decays\nin band G ~Fig. 2! solely due to considerations of the spin\nand parity of the ;0.5-ms isomer, discussed in Sec. III M,\narising from the feeding of bands E and F.\nM. Seven-quasiparticle 466-ms isomer\nThe highest energy members of bands E, F, and G are fed\nexclusively by a long-lived multiquasiparticle state with t1\/2\n5466615 ms. This can be seen in the time spectrum shown\nin Fig. 10. The 466-ms state is likely to be of seven-\nquasiparticle nature, due to its spin and excitation energy,\nwhich cannot be made from any combination of five nucle-\nons near the Fermi surface of 179Re. In the scheme of Fig. 2\nthe excitation energy of the isomer is considered provision-\nally to be equal to that of the highest observed level identi-\nfied in the present out-of-beam data, namely 5408 keV. This\nimplies transition energies to bands E and F of 18 and 56\nkeV, respectively. These two decays have not been observed\ndirectly. However, as Fig. 8 ~bottom! shows, there is a can-\ndidate low-energy 56-keV peak for the transition to band F,\nbut a firm placement is not justified here due to inconsistent\ncoincidences with other transitions in band E.\nAlthough it is not possible to give the seniority-seven\nstate an unambiguous spin assignment, consideration of the\ndirect decay to band E provides constraints. The transitions\ncan be assumed to be of M1, E1, E2, or M2 character, since\nFIG. 12. A graph of calculated peak area in the LEPS as a\nfunction of transition energy for various multipoles. These g-ray\nintensities are normalized to the 310-keV decay in the 314-keV\ngated x-ray spectrum @Fig. 8 ~top!#. The uncertainties in the calcu-\nlated peak areas are less than the symbol size in all cases. The\nobservation limit ~long-dashed line! corresponds to 150 counts\nabove background in the spectrum within 1 keV ~five channels! in\nthe LEPS.054309for higher multipolarities the Weisskopf single-particle half-\nlife estimates become excessively large compared to the\nmeasured partial half-life. For example, an 18-keV E3 tran-\nsition gives tW\ntrans .50.4 s ~including electron conversion!\nwhereas an 18-keV M2 transition yields tW\ntrans .514 ms. If\nthe deexcitation proceeded by an M2 transition it can be\nargued that the higher energy E3 transition to the next mem-\nber of the (33\/21) band would be able to compete. However,\nno significant feeding is observed into the ~43\/2! or lower\nspin levels of band E. This leaves three possibilities for the\nnature of the decay out of the seven-quasiparticle state; E1,\nM1, or E2, corresponding to (47\/22), (47\/21), and (49\/21)\nassignments, respectively. It may be argued that if the 18-\nkeV transition were M1, then a competing E2 decay would\nbe expected, but such a quadrupole decay might be weaker\nthan the dipole decay, and could therefore remain unob-\nserved.\nThe yrast status of the seven-quasiparticle state can be\ninferred by comparison of the normalized singles intensities\nof the prompt transitions in the Kp51\/22 band from the 45\/2\nand 49\/2 \\ levels ~at 4756 and 5575 keV, respectively!, with\nthe delayed transitions in band E at ~45\/2! \\ . The results\nimply that the Kp51\/22 band is yrast at spin 45\/2, i.e., it is\nmore strongly populated, but that by 49\/2 the normalized\nde-excitation of the isomer is the more intense @14#, favoring\na Kp549\/21 assignment ~see Fig. 11!. However, the iso-\nmeric state observed could still retain a K547\/2 assignment\nand be fed by a close-lying shorter-lived Kp549\/21 level,\ntherefore retaining the yrast nature of the level. The transi-\ntion rates and hindrances for the supposed 18-keV transition\nto band E are discussed in Sec. IV E, for all three possible\nassignments.\nWhile this analysis gives rise to a consistent picture, it is\nreasonable to propose a scenario in which the isomeric state\nhas an excitation energy of 54081D keV, such that unob-\nserved transitions feed all three of the five-quasiparticle\nbands E, F, and G. The 18-keV energy difference between\nthe upper levels in bands E and G would then become a\nlower limit on the transition energy to band E. Assuming the\ntransition was still not seen due to a lack of counts in the\ng-ray detectors, it is possible to impose upper limits on the\nenergy of the deexciting transition. The x-ray spectrum, pro-\njected from a 314-keV ~band E) g-ray gate, shown in Fig. 8\n~top!, was used for this investigation. The gate is not con-\ntaminated, and the direct isomer decay is assumed to have\nthe same normalized intensity as the 310-keV transition also\nin band E. The expected number of counts in the peak of the\ndirect decay is dependent on the multipolarity and transition\nenergy because of electron conversion and efficiency effects.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 12.\nIn a clean LEPS spectrum the observation limit for a peak\nis approximately 150 counts above the background within\nfive channels ~51 keV!. The upper limits on the energy for a\ndirect depopulation path from the 466-ms isomer to band E\nare: E2<70 keV; E3<140 keV; M1<40 keV; M2\n<140 keV, with E1 transitions being ruled out down to ;20\nkeV. ~The efficiency curve is reliable for energies .30 keV.!\nNote that the limits on the quadrupole and octupole transi--12\nPERSISTENCE OF K ISOMERISM IN THE N5104 . . .

It should be\npointed out that higher energy dipole transitions would re-\nmain unobserved should they fall beneath an x-ray peak, but\nthe ratios of the x rays in the 314-keV gated x-ray spectrum\nare found to be Ka1 \/Ka251.6660.06 and (Kb11Kb3)\/Kb2\n54.1060.41 in excellent agreement with the known values\nof 1.7160.05 and 4.3660.11, respectively @12#. This negates\nthe possibility of significant g-ray transitions lying under the\nx-ray peaks.\nTo summarize, the lower limit for the excitation energy is\n5408 keV with possible spin and parity assignments of\n47\/21, 47\/22, and 49\/21. The corresponding upper limits on\nthe excitation energy are &5410 (47\/21), <5430 keV\n(47\/22), and <5460 (49\/21). Note that in each case the\nlong ~466 ms! half-life does not have to originate from the\nstate at 5408 keV in Fig. 2, which may still in this case have\na half-life, but could come from a higher-spin intrinsic level\nwhich decays by a low energy transition to the 5408-keV\nstate.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIn Sec. IV A, blocked BCS calculations are presented\nwith a preliminary comparison of the predicted and observed\nmultiquasiparticle excitation energy spectra. In Secs. IV B\nand IV C g-factor and alignment analyses are carried out and\ndiscussed in terms of possible Nilsson configurations for the\nrotational bands observed in the current work. Following this\nevaluation of the extracted experimental information, con-\nfiguration assignments are justified in Sec. IV D. The behav-\nior of the five- and seven-quasiparticle structures are dis-\ncussed in terms of reduced transition rates in Sec. IV E.\nFinally, moments of inertia and systematics of the N5104\nisotones are explored ~Secs. IV F and IV G!.\nA. Blocked BCS calculations\nMultiquasiparticle Nilsson calculations have been per-\nformed for 75\n179Re104 using the blocked BCS technique de-054309scribed by Jain et al. @15#. This enables comparisons to be\nmade between the experimental and predicted excitation en-\nergy spectra for the intrinsic states observed in this study.\nThe input to these calculations includes the ~predicted! quad-\nrupole and hexadecapole deformation parameters, \u00ab2\n50.232 and \u00ab450.038 @16#, respectively. The monopole\npairing strengths for neutrons and protons were chosen as\nGn521.5 MeV\/nucleon and Gn522.5 MeV\/nucleon to re-\nproduce approximately the correct three-quasiparticle ener-\ngies in 179Re. These are very close to those adopted by Purry\net al. @4# for the isotone 74\n178W. The single-proton energies\nwere adjusted to yield the correct one-quasiproton energies\nin 179Re, whereas the corresponding single-neutron energies\nwere averaged from the four surrounding odd-A even-Z nu-\nclei 74\n177,179W103,105 and 76\n179,181Os103,105 @17#. Residual\nnucleon-nucleon interaction splitting energies @18# are from\nKondev @19#, and are similar to those quoted by Jain et al.\n@20#. The results are shown in Table IV. Predicted higher\nseniority seven- and nine-quasiparticle states are included to\nassist future studies.\nThe agreement between the calculated and experimental\nenergies are generally within \u201910% or better. The agreement\nis worst for the five quasiparticle states, in particular the\nKp5(31\/21) level and the bandhead of F for which the\npredicted energies are underestimated by 368 and 576 keV,\nrespectively. Indeed, only band E compares favorably, lying\nwithin 28 keV of the observed energy. However, the energy,\nspin, and parity have not been unambiguously determined for\nany of the seniority-five levels. In addition, the five-\nquasiparticle structures are far from yrast ~and are only\nweakly populated in-beam!, whereas the multiquasiparticle\ncalculations typically work best for configurations that lie\nlowest in energy, where the density of states and the associ-\nated statistical mixing are smallest.\nPredictions for low-lying high spin seven- and nine-\nquasiparticle states included in Table IV suggest that the\nyrast structure above the 466-ms isomer may be dominated\nby intrinsic states which are within reach with stable beam\/-14\nPERSISTENCE OF K ISOMERISM IN THE N5104 . . .

The intrinsic spin factor is attenuated by a factor of\n0.6 due to the experimentally observed condition that gS\n50.6gS~free! @22#. The experimental results and calculated\nvalues are shown in Table V. The calculated g factors are\nbased on the Nilsson configurations found in Table IV.\nThis analysis suffers from the absence of angular distri-\nbutions from which the sign of d could be determined. This\ndeficiency means that configurations with intrinsic g factors\nof the same magnitude, but differing signs cannot be dis-\ncriminated. The difficulty with obtaining such information in\nthis case is that the transitions of interest are only usefully\npopulated in the decay of the 466-ms isomer.\nThe one-quasiparticle Kp55\/21 and 9\/22 bands for\nwhich both DI51 and 2 transitions are observed, yield\nweighted mean values for (gK2gR)56(1.3560.04) and\n6~1.0160.05!, respectively, in excellent accord with the the-\noretical values of 11.1660.07 and 10.9560.07. The largest\ncontribution to the uncertainty in the calculated values comes\nfrom gR . The agreement for the one-quasiparticle structures\ngives confidence that the chosen parameters are realistic.\nThe weighted mean value of u(gK2gR)u for the Kp\n5(17\/21) band is 0.17760.007 again in good agreement\nwith the theoretical value of 10.1360.07. There is no evi-054309dence for any band crossing taking place, as there are are\nsmall fluctuations in the g factors and no out-of-band decays.\nFor band E Table V shows the experimental g factors\nextracted if the Ip5(33\/21) level at 3456 keV is the band-\nhead. The fluctuations are small and the majority, within the\nuncertainties, match the predicted value for the Kp533\/21\nconfiguration ~Table IV!. One of the alternative assignments\nconsidered was Kp531\/21 and the values are quoted in\nTable VI. This assumes that the 3277-keV ~31\/2! \\ level\nforms the bandhead, and that the 178-keV transition is an\nintraband decay, albeit with a rather low energy. However, in\nthis scenario there is no agreement between the extracted and\ncalculated values for (gK2gR). It is worth noting that the\nalternative Kp533\/22 label for the 3277-keV level ~i.e., an\nE2 assignment for the 1272-keV transition! would lead to a\nKp533\/22 assignment for the 3456-keV level in band E.\nThis scenario is also considered in Table VI, but in this case\nthere is no agreement between the experimental and calcu-\nlated g factors.\nFor band F in Table V, the deviations in the quantity\nu(gK2gR)u across the range of spins is again small, and cor-\nresponds well with that predicted for the Kp533\/22 assign-\nment. For comparison, three alternative situations are consid-\nered in Table VI. These are Kp531\/21, 33\/21, and 35\/21.\nWhen any of these K values are substituted, the g factors for\nthe members of band F increase, and the theoretical values\nare not well reproduced. Note that a Kp535\/21 assignment\nwould lead to the 265-keV transition having E2 character,\nand subsequently result in 1\\ of angular momentum being\nadded to the excited band members.\nFinally, considering possible assignments for band G, the\npreferred Kp535\/21 label gives a mean u(gK2gR)u50.37\n60.10 in reasonable agreement with an expected value of\n20.3060.07. However, the 604-keV crossover transition\nfrom the 4308-keV state is tentative and the 292-, 313-, and\n425-keV transitions for which these g factors are calculated-16\nPERSISTENCE OF K ISOMERISM IN THE N5104 . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 66, 054309 ~2002!do not form a regular rotational sequence. The weak nature\nof the DI52 transitions leads to the large extracted gyro-\nmagnetic factors, which, of the plausible alternative K values\nsuggested in Table VI, correspond most closely with Kp\n535\/21. Note that the proposal of the Kp5(31\/21) state at\n3277 keV as the bandhead requires a reduction in spin of 1\\\nfor the rotational levels, compared to those quoted in Table\nV.\nOverall, the assignments adopted in Fig. 2 lead to good\nagreement between extracted gyromagnetic ratios using the\nrotational model expressions and those calculated with the\nNilsson configurations given in Table IV of Sec.

The results for the bands observed here in\n179Re, are plotted in Fig. 13 as a function of rotational fre-\nquency. This allows bands involving high-j orbitals, such as\nthe i13\/2 neutrons, to be distinguished by their larger Coriolis\ninduced alignment. This distinction can be clearly seen in\nFig. 13. The bands built on configurations containing no\nhigh-j particles are the 5\/21@402# and 9\/22@514# one-\nquasiparticle structures, both of which have a low initial\ncomponent along the rotation axis. A more detailed discus-\nsion of the one-quasiparticle band alignments is given in Ref.\n@7#. From the alignments shown in Fig. 13 for the higher\nseniority bands, several properties are evident. First, band G\ndoes not form a regular rotational cascade and is perhaps\nseveral different structures or one structure undergoing a\nstrong interaction. The lack of further information rules out a\ncomprehensive interpretation of this band.\nThe significantly large aligned angular momentum ob-\ntained for the Kp5(17\/21) three-quasiparticle band is some-\nwhat anomalous, given that no high-j neutrons appear in the\nconfiguration ~see Table IV!. The observed alignment is\nsmaller than that of band C which contains a neutron in the\ni13\/2 7\/21@633# Nilsson orbital, but is also comparable to that\nof band B, which may have a neutron in the i13\/2 9\/21@624#\norbital ~although the assignment of band B is less certain!.\nAn explanation for the origin of the Kp5(17\/21) alignment\nmay be in an interaction with a close lying band, although no\nperturbation from a regular rotational cascade can be dis-\ncerned. However, the Kp5(17\/21) band is nonyrast and\nmay be subject to complex interactions.\nBands E and F exhibit the highest alignments and both are\nconstructed from configurations containing two i13\/2 neu-\ntrons, i.e., the t configuration ~see Table IV!. The large align-\nment can be understood in terms of a large Coriolis interac-\ntion, combined with a decrease in pairing, which increases\nthe collective moment of inertia. The latter is equivalent to\nan increase in the relative alignment. This is counteracted by\nthe lowering of the DK561 mixing due to the reduced\npairing, which has a greater effect. The overall result is a\nquenching of the relative alignment @23#, which is shown in\nFig. 13 to be much less than twice that of band C. Therefore,\nif pairing was still playing a role, one would be expected to\nobserve a lowering of the relative alignment @23#, to below\nthat of band C. The evidence here may point towards the\ncontroversial conclusion that the no pairing limit has been\nreached. This is discussed further in Sec. IV F.\nIn general there is good qualitative agreement between the\nextent of rotational alignment observed and that expected\nfrom inspection of the multiquasiparticle configurations\ngiven in Table IV.-17\nC.

Blocked BCS\ncalculations give a bandhead energy of 1824 keV, but experi-\nmentally the excitation energy of this band with respect to\nthe 1772-keV level through which it depopulates remains to\nbe discovered. The Kp523\/21 band is found at 1699 keV in\n177Ta with similar intraband transition energies @25#. Note\nthat the energy of first first DI51 transition in band C is\nperturbed, lowering its energy compared to the trend of those\nfurther up the band. This effect arises due to a Coriolis in-\nteraction with a nearby band built on a similar configuration\nwith only one neutron different, i.e., in the slightly higher\nenergy 92 1@624# orbital as opposed to the 72 1@633# orbital.\nThe interaction between these structures is able to lower the\nexcitation energy of all the members of band C except the\nbandhead, resulting in a \u2018\u2018compressed\u2019\u2019 first transition en-\nergy.

Forbidden transitions and hindrances\nElectromagnetic transition rates from K isomers are sen-\nsitive to nuclear structure effects. Transitions are classified as\n\u2018\u2018K forbidden\u2019\u2019 when the change in K value exceeds the tran-\nsition multipolarity, i.e., DK.l . Such transitions are sys-\ntematically hindered @27#, depending on the degree of forbid-\ndenness, n5DK2l , and it is useful to define the reduced\nhindrance, f n5@ t1\/2g \/tWg #1\/n, where t1\/2g is the partial g-ray\nhalf-life and tW\ng is the corresponding Weisskopf single--19\nC. THWAITES, C. WHELDON, A. M. BRUCE et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 66, 054309 ~2002!particle estimate. The quantity t1\/2\ng \/tW\ng is referred to as the\nWeisskopf hindrance factor, denoted by FW . The multipolar-\nity and transition-energy effects, as well as the degree of K\nforbiddenness are thus accounted for in the reduced hin-\ndrance. Any additional variations, as a function of spin, ex-\ncitation energy, and other degrees of freedom @28#, probe the\nmechanisms by which axial symmetry is broken. Table VII\nshows the Weisskopf and reduced hindrances for highly\nK-forbidden transitions observed or implied in the current\nwork.\nFor the Kp5(31\/21) level at 3277 keV, three K-forbidden\ndecays are known for which the favored multipolarities have\nbeen determined. The 653- and 1272-keV (E1) transitions to\nthe Kp51\/22 band are 14-fold K forbidden and have re-\nduced hindrance factors of ,1.6 and ,1.9, respectively.\nThese values are tiny, and suggest that there is essentially no\nK forbiddenness for these two decays. ~Generally f n*20 is\ntaken as a convenient limit for K conservation.! On closer\ninspection such low hindrance values are not surprising, as\nthis level is \u2019900 keV above the yrast line and lies within 25\nkeV of the (31\/21) state in the Kp5(19\/21) band (C). This\nmeans that both statistical and two-state K mixing can take\nplace @28#. The former arises when levels are nonyrast due to\na high density of states with DK561 and in the latter case\na juxtaposition of lower K states with the same spin and\nparity is responsible for the mixing. ~Note that, although\nyrast, the 1\/22@541# band is perturbed by a strong Coriolis\naction due to the low V and relatively high j of this h9\/2\nproton orbital. The effect of this interaction is to increase the\nhigh-K components in the band members.! Note that in\n177Ta, an isotone of 179Re, a Kp531\/21 23 ns isomer with\nthe same configuration as assigned to the 3277-keV state\ndecays via a 552-keV E2 multipole, with n510 and f n53\n@25#.\nThe 146-keV magnetic dipole transition to the Kp\n5(17\/21) band proceeds with f n5,3.5. Again, this is very\nfast for a DK57 M1 decay, but suffers from the same ef-\nfects as discussed above for the parallel 653- and 1272-keV\ntransitions. Indeed, one might expect an even faster de-\nexcitation via this particular route, arising from the nonyrast\nnature of the Ip5(29\/21) rotational level at 3131 keV. This\npermits statistical mixing in both the final and initial states.\nThe transition rates for the decays from the 466 ms isomer\nto bands E, F, and G are also investigated. For this purpose\nthe three possible spin and parity assignments, discussed in\nSec. III M, are examined separately in Table VII. It is as-\nsumed in the arguments that follow that the level at 5408\nkeV is the isomeric level. This gives an upper limit for the\nhindrance factors in each case because higher energy transi-\ntions, compared to the 18- and 56-keV de-excitations, would\nresult in smaller Weisskopf single-particle estimates. Note\nthat the combination of increasing transition energy and de-\ncreasing electron conversion combine to maintain an ap-\nproximately constant Weisskopf single-particle estimate for\nlow energy ~&100 keV! transitions. This means that up to the\nenergy limit for the isomeric state determined in Sec. III M,\n<5460, the hindrance of the decay paths to bands E and F\ndo not change significantly.054309For the preferred Kp5(47\/21) assignment the 18-, 56-,\nand 245-keV M1 transitions from the seven-quasiparticle\nisomer to band E, F, and G, have f n517.5, 25.4, and 78,\nrespectively. However, only the upper level of band E fits\nneatly with a rotational interpretation, whereas the 5352- and\n5163-keV states at the top of bands F and G, respectively,\ncould plausibly have higher K values than the bandheads\nshown in Fig. 2. If this is the case, and the final levels are\nintrinsic, the discussion of reduced hindrances is baseless,\nbut they are included in Table VII for completeness. Never-\ntheless, for an 18-keV magnetic dipole decay with DK57,\nf n517.5 indicates a K-hindered transition and a persistence\nof K conservation in the high-spin domain ~though K cannot\nbe pure in band E due to the high alignment!. For the alter-\nnative assignments of Kp5(47\/22) or (49\/21) the 18-keV\n(E1 or E2) transition from the isomer to band E, would have\nf n55.07 or 3.59, respectively. These transition rates would\nthen suggest a very fast transition with a loss of K conserva-\ntion.\nAlthough band E has a high alignment ~described in detail\nin Sec. IV F!, by spin ~45\/2! band E is still 634 keV above\nthe corresponding spin state in the yrast 1\/22@541# band.\nMoreover, the Ip5(45\/21) state in band F lies only 38 keV\nFIG. 14.

For an 18-keV electric quadrupole transition,\nFW52140, within a factor of 4 of FW5600, found for the\nK-allowed 86-keV E2 transition from the Kp549\/22 133-ms\nisomer in 177Ta. Since this latter transition is not K forbid-\nden, but has a similar hindrance factor, this would imply that\nif the isomer has a Kp549\/21 assignment, K is essentially\nhaving no effect, and that the long half-life would, in this\ninstance, originate from the yrast status, compared to nearby\nrotational states.\nThe highest spin K isomers known to date which depopu-\nlate via highly K-forbidden hindered transitions are in 176Ta\nand 178Ta. In the former, a six-quasiparticle Kp5202\n970-ms isomer partially de-excites via a 345-keV E2 transi-\ntion with n54 and f n546.8 @30#. Whereas in 178Ta, a\n260-ms Kp5212 state decays via a 34-keV E2 with n54\nand f n530.4 @30#. As more protons are added, moving away\nfrom the region of the most prolate deformed nuclei, it is\nexpected that K isomerism will be eroded as a result of the\nloss of axial symmetry or increasing g softness. This has\nbeen found for higher neutron and proton numbers ~e.g.,\n186Os @31#!.\nFor the seven-quasiparticle isomer in 179Re observed\nhere, the lack of more definite spectroscopic data unfortu-\nnately makes firm conclusions difficult to draw, but the pre-\nferred Kp547\/21 assignment leads to K-hindered transi-\ntions, implying that the K quantum number remains robust.\nF. Moments of inertia\nThe moment of inertia for a rotational band can be ex-\ntracted from the ratio of the total aligned angular momentum,\nIx @calculated from Eqs. ~4! and ~5!#, to the rotational fre-\nquency. The kinematic moment of inertia, I (1)5\\(Ix \/v),\nyields information about the bulk rotation of the nucleus,\nwhereas the dynamic moment of inertia, I (2)5\\(dIx \/dv) is\nrelated to the quasiparticle motion. For a rigid body the ki-\nnematic and dynamic quantities should be identical and\nequal to 85\\2 MeV21 for the quadrupole deformations ob-\nserved in this region @32#. This analysis also provides infor-\nmation on pairing within the nuclear system @23,33#. Figure\n14 and Table VIII show the moments of inertia for bands in\n179Re and other N5104 isotones.

This gives rise to the distinctive\nsignature of the close-lying DI51 transitions in the g-ray\nspectra ~e.g., Fig. 7!. Indeed, band E almost looks vibra-\ntional, which would, in the harmonic limit, give rise to equal\ng-ray energies. The large value of the dynamic moment of\ninertia measured here for band E together with the increase\nin the alignment, suggests, using the criteria proposed by\nDracoulis et al. @23#, that pairing correlations are no longer\nhaving a significant effect. However, the observation of\nrigid-body rotation cannot be firmly concluded due to the\ninequality between I (1) and I (2). ~The kinematic moment of\ninertia for band E is 56.4 \\2 MeV21.)\nG. N\u02dc104 isotones\nThe 466-ms state is the longest lived isomer involving\nseven or more quasiparticles. Inspection of the systematics\nfor the N5104 isotones suggests that such high-seniority\nisomeric states are endemic for proton numbers up to and\nincluding Z576. Table IX details the high-K isomers known\nto date in this sequence.\nOn the proton-rich side of the N5104 sequence, iridium\nis the first isotone without a long-lived high-K isomer. Dra-\ncoulis et al. @36# have studied 77\n181Ir104 to high spins, but no\nisomeric states have been identified beyond the three-\nquasiparticle regime. On the proton-deficient side of this iso-\ntonic chain, 71\n175Lu104 has not been studied to high spin, pri-\nmarily for practical reasons. Fusion-evaporation reactions\nwith stable beam and target combinations can no longer ac-\ncess these nuclei, although light-ion incomplete fusion reac-\ntions can probe the nuclear levels up to medium spins <20\n\\ . The most neutron rich of these isotones that is potentially\naccessible, 170Dy, lies at midshell and would provide an ex-\ncellent laboratory for testing the robustness of K isomerism\nat high angular momenta, beyond the domain explored so far\n@37#.\nOn balance it seems likely that this chain of isotonic nu-\nclei will provide still further examples of high-spin long-\nlived states, the most significant of which may still await\ndiscovery.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, the nuclear decay of 75\n179Re has been inves-\ntigated using data from out-of-beam electron conversion and\ng-g experiments carried out at the Australian National Uni-\nversity. Many new high-K bands and bandheads have been\nobserved, the most dramatic of which is a seven-\nquasiparticle isomer with a half-life of 466615 ms. This is\nthe longest lived isomeric state known to date involving-21\nC. THWAITES, C. WHELDON, A. M. BRUCE et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 66, 054309 ~2002!more than six quasiparticles. The preferred Kp5(47\/21) as-\nsignment suggests that K conservation is persisting at high\nangular momenta. This nucleus lies close to the proton-rich\nedge of the well-deformed nuclei in the A\u2019180 region and\nmay define the limit of K robustness in the N5104 isotones.\nSuggestions for further studies together with predictions of\nhigher lying states have been discussed. Some of the most\nextreme demonstrations of yrast traps are found in the N\n5104 isotonic chain of nuclei, though more remarkable\ncases may yet be found as the N\/Z ratio increases.054309ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the technical staff of the\n14UD accelerator for their support and hospitality.
