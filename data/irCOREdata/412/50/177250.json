By recording and evaluating single-shot \nLIG signals it was possible to determine, on a cycle-averaged basis, the \ntemporal evolution of the local (within a probe volume 300 \u03bcm in diameter \nand 10 mm in length) equivalence ratio and by this the fuel-air ratio. Two \ndifferent data treatment strategies, subject to C3H8 concentration range, were \nfirst tested at stationary conditions and then used to evaluate the LIG signals \nobtained during the injection process. The relative standard deviation of \nsingle-shot measurements were estimated to be 0.14 and 0.32 at 0.8 % and \n10 % of propane concentration, respectively. \n\u00a92006 Optical Society of America \nOCIS codes: (190.1900) Diagnostic applications of nonlinear optics; (120.1740) Combustion \nDiagnostics. \nReferences and links \n1.

Introduction \nDiffraction by laser-induced gratings (LIG) is a well known technique for the investigation of \nthermophysical properties of liquids and condensed phase matter [1]. In recent years a lot of \neffort has been put to demonstrate the potential of LIGs for gas-phase diagnostics. In general, \nlaser-induced gratings are the spatially-periodic modulations of the refractive index, which \ncan be induced by two interfering pump laser beams. In the gas-phase there are two \ndominating contributions to such gratings, which are fundamentally different. These \ncontributions can be generated by electrostriction or by collisional relaxation of the absorbed \npump laser radiation, and are called electrostictive or thermal gratings, respectively. The \noverall modulation of the refractive index results from their interference. The measured signal \nis the part of a third, directed at an appropriate angle, laser beam Bragg-diffracted by this \nmodulation. Electrostrictive gratings are generated at any frequency of the pump laser light. In \nmedia that weakly absorb pump radiation electrostriction provides the major contribution to \nthe signal. In stronger absorbing media diffraction by thermal gratings may appear as the \ndominant process. More information about the theory of LIGs and their application to gas-\nphase diagnostics can be found, e. g., in recent reviews [2, 3]. \nIn non-reacting flows the LIGs technique has already been used to accomplish local \ntemporally-resolved measurements of the gas temperature (e. g. [4, 5]), gas dynamic \nproperties (e. g., [6, 7]), species concentration in binary isothermal gas mixtures (e. g., [8, 9]) \nor flow velocity (e. g., [10, 11]). Furthermore simultaneous measurements of temperature and \npressure [12, 13] or temperature and flow velocity [14, 15] have been performed successfully. \nThis technique has also been applied to flames for temperature measurements (e. g., [16-19]). \nAll the results obtained show that the LIGs technique is a promising method for the \ninvestigation of mixture formation in injection and combustion processes. Up to now for the \ninvestigation of these processes both linear and non-linear Raman techniques have often been \nused (e. g., [20, 21]). However, because of the small Raman scattering cross sections the \nsignal levels are comparatively low, which limits the sensitivity of the methods in this \napplication [20, 21]. In the present work the LIGs technique has been applied to study \n#75516 - $15.00 USD Received 27 September 2006; revised 6 December 2006; accepted 7 December 2006\n(C) 2006 OSA 25 December 2006 \/ Vol. 14,  No. 26 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12995\nquantitatively the injection of gaseous propane, C3H8, into air under non-reacting conditions. \nThe technique was used for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to determine the \ntemporal evolution of the local equivalence ratio in a non-stationary pulse-repetitive flow on a \ncycle-averaged basis. Propane is one of the main components of liquefied petroleum gas \n(LPG), which is of special interest as an alternative fuel in spark-ignited engines. In general, \nthe LIGs technique is also applicable to other gaseous fuels prior to ignition. For \nconcentration measurements only a proper pump laser wavelength is required in order to \nachieve resonant excitation of species to be detected. \n2. Experimental setup \nA scheme of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. In the experiment two equally \npolarized beams of a pulse-repetitive Nd:YAG laser at \u03bb = 1064 nm were used as pump \nradiation to create LIGs in propane\/nitrogen and propane\/air mixtures. The Nd:YAG laser \nprovided pulses of 30 mJ with a duration of 7 ns, which were splitted into two pump beams. \nThe pump and the probe beams were focussed by a lens (f = 1000 mm) and crossed at the \nappropriate angles. The crossing angle of the pump beams was 2.04\u00b0 providing the fringe \nspacing of about 30 \u03bcm. The dimensions of the probe volume are estimated to be 300 \u03bcm in \ndiameter and 10 mm in length. The temporal evolution of the gratings has been recorded by \ndiffracting a cw Ar+-laser beam (514.5 nm, 70 mW). Signal detection was accomplished using \na photomultiplier tube in combination with an optical fiber, acting as a spatial filter, and an \ninterference filter centered at the probe wavelength. The photomultiplier signal was supplied \nto a 500-MHz digital oscilloscope, which was connected to a computer. \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Scheme of the experimental setup. (GP: Glan polarizing prism, T: telescope, BS: beam \nsplitter, PD: trigger photo diode, OS: digital oscilloscope, M: mirror, FL: focusing lens, IC: \ninjection chamber, CC: heatable calibration cell, BD: beam dump, CL: collimating lens, OF: \noptical fiber, PMT: photomultiplier tube; IF: interference filter). \n \nWith the developed setup, concentration measurements in propane\/nitrogen and \npropane\/air mixtures have been performed in two different pressurized environments: (1) in a \nheatable cell under stationary conditions - for calibration purposes; (2) in a non-reacting jet \nfrom a gasoline direct injection (GDI) system fueled with gaseous C3H8. The injection \nchamber has an inner diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm. It is equipped with three \nrectangular borosilicate glass windows (Schott BK7) providing the optical access to the probe \nvolume inside the chamber. A high-pressure prototype GDI injector with a nominal cone \nangle of 60\u00b0 is used. The duration of the injector driving pulses, that were synchronized with \n#75516 - $15.00 USD Received 27 September 2006; revised 6 December 2006; accepted 7 December 2006\n(C) 2006 OSA 25 December 2006 \/ Vol. 14,  No. 26 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12996\nthe pump laser shots, could be varied in the range of a few ms. The LIG probe volume was \npositioned at a distance of 45 mm downstream the injector nozzle orifice at the axis of the \ninjection cell. The chamber pressure and temperature were maintained at about 3 bar and \n345 K, respectively. To ensure that fuel of a previous injection cycle is removed from the \nchamber before the next injection starts, a continuous air flow through the chamber was \nprovided with a velocity of 0.2 m\/s. The injection rate was kept constant at 1 Hz throughout \nthe experiments to additionally ensure that the previously injected fuel is taken out of the \nchamber before a new measurement occurs. Further details about the injection chamber and its \noperation can be found elsewhere [22]. \n3. Calibration measurements and data evaluation \nPropane molecules weakly absorb radiation at \u03bb = 1.06 \u03bcm (\u03b1 \u2248 10-4 cm-1 bar-1 at ambient \ntemperature) within overtone or combination bands. The excitation of C3H8 molecules is \nfollowed by rapid relaxation of their internal energy due to collisions. As a result, two \ndifferent LIG formation mechanisms are observed in gas mixtures with small concentration of \npropane: electrostriction and thermalization. The amplitude of the electrostrictive contribution \nis proportional to the overall gas pressure, while that of the thermal contribution - to the \npartial pressure of the absorbing propane molecules. Due to interference the thermal \ncontribution may significantly modify the profile of the observed LIG signals and enhance \ntheir strength. Therefore, depending on the C3H8 concentration or mole fraction, x (given in \n%), two different evaluation procedures were applied. \nFor x \u2264 1.6 % it was found to be possible to determine concentrations from the ratio \nR = I1\/I2 of the amplitudes I1 and I2 of the first two oscillation peaks of the LIG signals with \nclearly defined interfering electrostrictive and thermal contributions, as displayed in Fig. 2(a) \nfor a cell measurement. The single-shot LIG signal profile of Fig. 2(a) was recorded in an \nx \u2248 0.8 % propane\/nitrogen mixture at p = 2 bar and T = 335 K. The LIG signal peaks \namplitudes ratio R is defined by the ratio of the amplitudes of thermal and electrostrictive \ncontributions, which is proportional to C3H8 mole fraction x. Calibration measurements of the \ndependence of the ratio R on C3H8 concentration in the range x = 0.2-1.6 % were performed in \nthe cell under stationary conditions. The calibration data were obtained in the pressure range \nof 1-4 bar and at cell temperature of 298 K. It was found that even though the LIG signal \nprofile and strength are changing with pressure increase, the measured value of R is \npractically not dependent on pressure in the range under investigation. This can be confirmed \nby theoretical considerations, similar to those outlined in [23], if one assumes that the \ninstantaneous relaxation is the main reason for the thermal contribution. \nFollowing the same theoretical approach one can also show that the ratio of the thermal \nand electrostrictive contributions differs by only about 3 % in nitrogen and air. Hence, the \ncalibration curve obtained for propane in nitrogen can be also used to define propane \nconcentrations in propane\/air mixtures. In addition, it should be noted that under the \nassumptions mentioned above the ratio of the thermal and electrostrictive contributions scales \nas T -1\/2. Since during the injection process under study temperature in the cell does not exceed \n345 K, the ratio of these contributions should change by less than 8 %, as related to that at the \ncalibration temperature. Therefore, in the first approximation the calibration dependence \nmeasured at room temperature can be regarded as applicable for the characterization of \npropane concentrations during the injection process without corrections for gas temperature. \nThe results of calibration measurements based on 100 accumulated single-shot signals are \ndisplayed in Fig. 2(b). The temperature in the cell was 298 K, and the lowest detected propane \nconcentration was x = 0.2 %. The solid line in Fig. 2(b) is the fitted exponential curve with the \nindicated fitting parameters. \n \n#75516 - $15.00 USD Received 27 September 2006; revised 6 December 2006; accepted 7 December 2006\n(C) 2006 OSA 25 December 2006 \/ Vol. 14,  No. 26 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12997\n  \nFig. 2. (a) Measured single-shot LIG signal with clearly defined interfering electrostrictive and \nthermal contributions; I1 and I2 are the amplitudes of the first two oscillation peaks employed to \nderive the propane concentration; (p\n cell = 2 bar; T cell = 335 K). (b) Calibration data used to \nderive propane concentrations in the range of 0.2-1.6 %; (pressure range: 1-4 bar; T\n \ncell = 298 K). \n \n \nThe distribution of C3H8 concentrations, evaluated using the peaks amplitudes ratio, from \n100 single-shot signals recorded under stationary conditions in the cell with nitrogen \n(p\n cell = 2 bar, T cell = 335 K), containing propane at known concentration of about 0.8 %, \nappeared to be nearly Gaussian. The mean value obtained is x = 0.78 %, while the relative \nstandard deviation, that can be taken as an estimate of the measurement error, is \u03c3R = 0.14. \nFor x \u2265 1.6 % the thermal contributions to the LIG signals are strongly dominating, and \ntherefore the concentration can no longer be determined from the ratio of the peaks \namplitudes. In this case the information on x can be derived from the signal oscillation period, \nTg. As an example, Fig. 3(a) shows a single-shot LIG signal profile recorded in a 6 % of \npropane in air mixture (p\n cell = 2.7 bar, T cell = 345 K), where only the thermal contribution is \ndirectly observed. The oscillation period was defined to be Tg = 79.5 \u00b1 1.4 ns. In Fig. 3(b) the \nconcentration dependence of Tg is shown, calculated for C3H8 concentrations up to 10 %, \nusing the relation describing the dependence of a binary mixture adiabatic sound velocity on \nspecies concentration and the known values of the appropriate gas parameters. One can \nreadily show that at small C3H8 concentrations Tg \u2248 Tg0\u00b7(1 + 0.56\u00b7x). \nThe single-shot data allow to estimate the relative standard deviation of concentrations \nderived from the oscillation periods (i.e. the measurement error) as \u03c3\n T \u2248 0.018\u00b7Tg0\/(Tg - Tg0). \nIn particular, \u03c3\n T \u2248 0.39, if the concentration is derived using the signal in Fig. 3(a). \nObviously, \u03c3\n T reduces when Tg increases with x. By assuming \u03c3 T \u2264 1 one can get an estimate \nof the lower limit of C3H8 concentration that can be defined with reasonable accuracy, if this \napproach is employed: x\n min \u2265 3.2 %. For the range of the intermediate C3H8 concentrations, \ni. e. x \u2248 1.6-3.2 %, the procedure of signal profile fitting, with x as the fitting parameter, can \nbe used. It takes into account variations of the ratio of electrostrictive and thermal \ncontributions - in frame of a certain relaxation model, as well as that of the oscillation period \nand peaks position (oscillation phase shift), with propane concentration. However, this \nprocedure is more elaborate and time-consuming in data treatment. \n \n \n#75516 - $15.00 USD Received 27 September 2006; revised 6 December 2006; accepted 7 December 2006\n(C) 2006 OSA 25 December 2006 \/ Vol. 14,  No. 26 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12998\n  \nFig. 3. (a) Thermal contribution dominated single-shot LIG signal recorded in a 6 % of propane \nin air mixture (p\n cell = 2.7 bar, T cell = 345 K); the oscillation period Tg = 79.5 ns is evaluated \nfrom the signal profile. (b) Calculated propane concentration dependence of Tg used to define \nconcentrations in the range of 1.6-10 %. \n \n4. Experimental results \nThe constant volume injection chamber experiments have been conducted in order to follow \nthe temporal variation of the C3H8 concentration, and consequently that of the equivalence \nratio, in the probe volume. Propane heated up to 330 K was injected at pressure of 13 bar. The \ninjector driving pulse length was set at 5 ms. The chamber pressure and temperature were \nstabilized at 3 bar and 345 K, respectively. When gaseous propane is injected and \nmeasurements are taken at increasing delays after the start of the injector driving pulse, a \nsequence of values as presented in Fig. 4 can be derived from the recorded LIG signals. The \ndelays have been increased in steps varying between 0.2 and 1 ms. The points represent the \nmean of up to 25 values, each derived from a single-shot measurement. A steep increase of the \nC3H8 concentration can be seen at 1.1-1.2 ms delay, when the injected gas reaches the probe \nvolume. During about 4.5 ms a constant C3H8 concentration x = 7.0 %, corresponding to the \nequivalence ratio of about 1.8, could be derived. At larger delays the C3H8 concentration \ndecreases again as the fuel cloud is moving away from the probe volume. At delays as large \nas, e. g., 10 ms the evaluated equivalence ratio reduces to approximately 0.1. \nAt the injection pulse front edge and large delays, when propane concentrations are lower \nthan 1.6 %, the equivalence ratios were determined from the peaks amplitudes ratio of the \nsignal profiles with the interfering electrostrictive and thermal contributions. These values are \nindicated in Fig. 4 by red squares. As an example, the error bars corresponding to a standard \ndeviation at stationary conditions, are shown with one of the points. The evaluated relative \nstandard deviation of 100 single-shot measurements at, e. g., 10 ms delay is \u03c3 iR \u2248 0.30, which \nis higher than the estimated \u03c3R value - probably, because of pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of \nC3H8 propagation in the injection chamber. \nAt delays when C3H8 concentrations are higher, the signal oscillation period was used to \nderive the equivalence ratios. The corresponding values are indicated in Fig. 4 by blue circles, \nwith the standard deviation for stationary conditions, shown as the error bars with one of these \npoints. The relative standard deviation of 100 single-shot measurements at, e. g., 4 ms delay is \n\u03c3 iT \u2248 0.49. One can consider the defined pairs of values \u03c3T, \u03c3 iT and \u03c3R, \u03c3 iR to be in a \nreasonable agreement with each other, since they provide the comparable, at different delays, \nestimate of the relative standard deviation of propane concentration fluctuations in the probe \nvolume from one injection pulse to another (\u03c3 i \u2248 0.28). \n \n#75516 - $15.00 USD Received 27 September 2006; revised 6 December 2006; accepted 7 December 2006\n(C) 2006 OSA 25 December 2006 \/ Vol. 14,  No. 26 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12999\n  \nFig. 4.

Summary \nThe measurement of the temporal evolution of the local equivalence ratio by use of laser-\ninduced gratings has been successfully demonstrated. As an example, a non-stationary gas \ninjection process was investigated, and experimental data derived from single-shot \nmeasurements are presented. The characteristic parameters of LIG signal profiles - like the \nratio of the oscillation peaks amplitudes and the oscillation period - have been employed to \nderive propane concentrations in the range of 0.2-10 % and to calculate the corresponding \nmixture equivalence ratios. Depending on the evaluation procedure, the respective relative \nuncertainties, which have been determined from additional cell measurements, are estimated \nto be in the range of 14-39 %. Since the LIGs technique shows the potential towards \ntemporally and spatially resolved measurements of the mixture equivalence ratio, its \napplicability to gas phase investigation of in-cylinder applications within internal combustion \nengines prior to ignition will be of interest for future studies. \nAcknowledgment \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for parts of the work by the DFG. \n \n#75516 - $15.00 USD Received 27 September 2006; revised 6 December 2006; accepted 7 December 2006\n(C) 2006 OSA 25 December 2006 \/ Vol. 14,  No. 26 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13000\n"}
