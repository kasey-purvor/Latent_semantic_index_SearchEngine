Introduction \nA number of studies have shown that organic systems may enhance species \nbiodiversity over non-organic counterparts as a result of increased complexity \nor quality of landscape features from the field to the landscape scale e.g. for \nbirds; (Chamberlain and Wilson 2000; Freemark and Kirk 2001), for plants; \n(Aude et al., 2003; Roschewitz et al., 2005a; Gibson et al., 2007; Boutin et al., \n2008) and for invertebrates; (Schmidt et al., 2005; Rundlof & Smith 2006; \nHolzschuh et al., 2007). Other studies looking at biodiversity differences \nbetween organic and conventional systems have shown that complexity at the \nfarm and landscape scale, independent of farming system, explained \nbiodiversity differences between farms (Weibull et al., 2003; Clough et al., \n2005; Purtauf et al., 2005).  Recent work strongly suggests that for certain \ntaxa, organic farming delivers fewer benefits when located within \nheterogeneous landscapes, with relatively large amounts of semi-natural \nvegetation, rather than simpler landscapes dominated by intensive farming \n(Roschewitz et al.,2005b; Schmidt et al., 2005; Tscharntke et al., 2005; \nRundlof and Smith 2006; Holzschuh et al., 2007) although differences may \nstill exist (Gibson et al., 2007).  \nThe reviews on the impacts of organic farming on biodiversity (Shepherd et \nal., 2003; Hole et al., 2005) draw attention to the need for system-level studies \nthat incorporate components of management practice (as \nrequired\/encouraged by organic certification bodies) which may differ between \norganic and non-organic farming systems. The elements of management \npractice which may have important implications for biodiversity include both \n 4\nregulations defining organic practice, such as the prohibition of many chemical \npesticides and inorganic fertilisers for organic farmers (Anon 2007) and \nindirect effects of those regulations, e.g. the use of grass-clover-leys for \nnutrient enrichment and weed suppression. Shepherd et al. (2003) indicated \nthat, in addition to these management options, organic farmers also tend to \nhave greater diversity of crop structure (Unwin and Smith 1995), under-sown \ncrops (Altieri and Letourneau 1982) and lower stocking densities \nIn contrast to previous studies this study attempts to understand the nature of \nany relationships which may exist between farming system and field, farm and \nlandscape complexity by investigating a large sample of paired organic and \nnon-organic fields and farms with arable land. As the sample of organic farms \nincluded farms which had converted to organic farming at different times it \nwas also possible to explore the impacts of longevity of organic practice on \nsome of the measured variables.  In this study no attempt was made to control \nfor differences between organic and non-organic farming systems in any of \nthe variables above, with farms being paired purely on location and covering \nthe whole of England, thus allowing any differences in the above variables to \nbe explored. The implications of the observed differences in field, farm and \nlandscape complexity for the substantial differences in richness and \nabundance found for a range of taxa on these study farms, (almost all of \nwhich reached higher levels on the organic farms) (Fuller et al., 2005) are \nconsidered.   \n \n 5\n2. Methods \nThe study was based on a total of 88 non-organic and 73 organic farms over \nthree cropping seasons between 2000 and 2004. Within these farms, \nlandscape context and farm management practices centred on 30 pairs of \ntarget spring cereal fields (in 2000) and 59 pairs of target winter wheat fields \n(over two seasons 2002-2004). In order to cover as many farms as possible, \non the majority of farms only one cereal field was studied, although due to the \nlimited numbers of farms with organic cereals available during the period of \nthe study both a spring and a winter field were examined on 16 organic and 1 \nnon-organic farm. Each organic target field was paired with a target field on a \ndifferent non-organic farm. Target fields were almost always surrounded by \nsimilarly managed fields managed by the same farmer. The vast majority of \nregistered English organic farms growing cereal crops on holdings of more \nthan 30 ha during the period of the study were included.  Organic farmers \nwere recruited through the two major UK registration bodies, The Soil \nAssociation and Organic Farmers and Growers on the basis of their listed \ncrops including spring and winter cereals. Non-organic farms were recruited \nwith the assistance of a UK cereal growers organisation (the Home Grown \nCereals Authority). Non-organic paired fields contained comparable crop \ntypes growing in the same season and located as close as possible (min = \n1km, max = 15km, mean = 7.4km and SD= 4.9km) but not adjacent to the \norganic target field. This was to prevent any overlap in study area impacting \non the results. \n 6\nLandscape complexity \nPotential differences in the landscape context of organic and non-organic \ncereal growing areas in England at the 1km2 scale were assessed using data \nfrom Land Cover Map 2000 integrated with CS2000 field survey data 2000 \n(Fuller et al., 2002; Firbank et al., 2003a; Howard and Bunce 1996). For each \nof the \u2018cereal growing\u2019 1km2 in England, data on the estimated percent \ncoverage of the Improved Grassland, Arable and Horticultural and other \ngrassland (Neutral, Calcareous and Acid) Broad Habitats (see Jackson 2000)  \nwere extracted. \n \nThe landscape context for each of the 89 organic fields used in the study \n(based on the 1km2 in which each target field was located) was compared \nagainst the typical context for land within the cereal-growing region of \nEngland. This was done by contrasting the proportions of different Broad \nHabitats, (both individually and grouped by grassland types) and the Northing \nand Easting of each 1km2 in which there was an organic target field with a \nbootstrapped estimated mean for a random sample of 1,000 cereal growing \n1km2 in England. A SAS program (SAS 1990) was designed to produce an \noutput giving two P values indicating whether the bootstrapped estimated \nmean for 1000 random sample km2 was significantly greater than or less than \n(at the 0.001 level) the estimated mean for the squares containing organic \ntarget fields. \n \nThe land cover dataset (see above) was also used to investigate differences \nbetween landscape level variables for paired organic and non-organic farms \n 7\non a local scale (1-25km2). Data on the %cover of individual and combined \nBroad Habitats in:  a) the 1 km2 containing the target field (target square), b) \nthe 3x3 km2 with the target square at its centre \u2013 the 9km2 scale - and c) the \n5x5 km2 with the target square at its centre \u2013 the 25km2 scale, were compared \nbetween organic and non-organic farms in each pair using Wilcoxon\u2019s paired \ntests.  \n \nFarm and field complexity \nHabitat survey areas were defined which covered a target field and up to five \nsurrounding fields (dependant on number of adjacent fields). This aspect of \nthe study provided a measure of farm-scale complexity. Within this area all \nhabitat patches were mapped at the 1:25,000 scale.  Habitat patches included \nindividual cropped fields, game strips, woods, ponds, grass margins, hedges \netc.  A hedge was defined as a single habitat patch unless its composition or \nstructure changed significantly or the adjacent habitats changed.  Habitat \nsurvey areas were visited on five occasions during one winter and any \nchanges in the habitat patches e.g. crops grown across the winter were \nrecorded. Data were compared using Wilcoxon\u2019s paired tests. \n \nField boundary surveys recorded base width and height and species \ncomposition of hedgerows surrounding target cereal fields on 80 of the 89 \npaired fields (sample size was dependent on availability of local habitat \nsurveyors).    \n \n 8\nFarmer questionnaires developed in conjunction with colleagues at the Royal \nAgricultural College and Elm Farm Research Centre relating to each target \nfield and farm involved in the study were completed by personal interview. \nFarmers were asked to provide information from both target fields and the \nwhole farm including: sowing dates, crop management (including rotation), \nfarm and field size, boundary management, extents of non-crop habitats, \narable and non-arable land, duration of management, agri-environment (AE) \nagreements held (Defra 2001), duration of organic management and whether \nor not they actively managed for wildlife. Data from the questionnaires was \ninterpreted with advice from an agronomist, e.g. the grouping of marginally \ndiffering rotations into agriculturally meaningful \u2018types\u2019 of rotation such as \n\u2018cereals with a break crop or set-aside\u2019, \u2018cereals with a ley\u2019 and \u2018continuous \ncereals\u2019. A range of analyses were carried out to test for differences between \norganic and non-organic farms (these included Wilcoxon matched pair test, \npaired T-Test, Mann Whitney test and Chi square as detailed in the results \nsection). Simple regression was used to investigate the impact of the period of \ntime for which a field had been under organic management on field size and \nthe proportions of arable and permanent pasture present on the farm.  \n \n3. Results \nLandscape complexity \nThe 1km2 in which target organic fields were located contained significantly \ngreater proportions of improved grass (managed leys and permanent pasture) \nand significantly smaller proportions of other grass (non-improved, including \n 9\nset-aside) than the mean for the random sample of 1km2 in English cereal \ngrowing areas (Table 1). The mean Northing of organic farm squares was \nsignificantly less than the mean of the random sample of 1km2 in English \ncereal growing areas indicating that the target squares were to the south of \nthe range of cereal growing areas in England (Table 1). \n \nBoth the 1 and 9km2 in which the organic target fields were located contained \nhigher ratios of grassland to arable land and more non-crop habitat than their \nnon-organic counterparts. There were no significant differences between the \nfarm types for the Broad Habitat types and groupings at the 25km2 scale \n(Table 2). \nFarm and field complexity \nThere were marked differences between the areas of particular habitats types \non organic and non-organic farm pairs (either in terms of total area or as a \nproportion of the area surveyed) (Table 3). The density of linear features \n(hedges and boundaries) was higher on organic farms. Organic farms \ncontained more grass habitats and non-organic farms contained more cereal \nand cropped habitat in the sampled area (Table 3).  \n \nHedgerow height, width and base width were significantly higher on organic \nfarms than on non-organic farms and numbers of trees and woody shrubs \nwere also higher though not significantly (Table 4). There were significantly \nhigher numbers of breaks and gaps in hedgerows surrounding non-organic \nfields (Table 4). \n \n 10\nData collected from the questionnaire confirmed that the sample of fields used \nin the study were representative of the farm types under study (i.e. managed \naccording to normal farm practice and surrounded by fields managed \nsimilarly).  \n \nMore organic than non-organic farms had land in agri-environment (AE) \nschemes (Table 5), but the target fields around which habitat surveys took \nplace were equally likely to be in an AE scheme whether they were on an \norganic (n=28) or a non-organic (n=26) field. Fields were smaller on organic \nfarms (mean organic 7.36ha, mean non-organic 10.65ha, paired T- test, \np<0.001) but farm size (Table 5) and contiguity of farmland (70% organic, \n77%% non-organic) did not differ between farm types. There were large \ndifferences between farm types in terms of spring cropping on target fields (on \nthe 30 farm pairs growing spring cereals) with organic systems using a wider \nvariety of crop type (Fig. 1). Non-organic farmers did not under-sow spring \ncrops with a ley, but 40% of organic farmers did (Fig. 1). \n \nDifferences in cropping practices reflected differences in anticipated crop use \nwith the majority of organic farmers growing spring crops for animal feed \n(73%) and the majority of non-organic farmers (55%) growing for malting. Use \nof winter cereals was more similar between farm types with the majority of \norganic and non-organic farmers growing winter wheat, 15% of organic \ngrowers chose triticale (as a better low\/no input crop) in preference to winter \nwheat (Fig.1).  \n \n 11\nThe results indicated that a range of significant differences in management \npractices existed between organic and non organic systems including, for \nexample; 1) rotations \u2013 with organic systems including grass leys (92%), non-\norganic systems using rape\/vegetables or set-aside as a break crop (87.5%) , \n2) hedge management practices \u2013 with organic farmers less likely to manage \nannually (only 49% managed hedges round the target fields in the study year \ncompared to 74% of non-organic farmers, see also Table 5), 3) sowing times \n\u2013 organic farmers sowed later for both winter and spring crops (Wilcoxon\u2019s \nmatched pair test, p<0.01),  4) more frequent use of animals within the \norganic farming system (predominantly to graze off either leys or crops, see \nTable 5), 5) use of synthetic fertilisers on all but one non-organic field but not \nat all on organic fields, 6) use of synthetic pesticides (particularly herbicides at \n95%) on all non-organic target fields and not at all on organic fields.   \n \nThere were, however, no significant differences between farm types in terms \nof: 1) the proportions of permanent pasture and its\u2019 management, 2) area of \nwoodland, 3) number of ponds, 4) number of non-crop habitats listed, 5) type \nof farm ownership (e.g. tenant, shared farm, owner), 6) changes in hedge \nnumbers on the farm historically (40 years) and 7) whether farmers positively \nmanaged for wildlife. \n  \nThe surveyed organic farms had been registered as organic for up to 20 years \nwith 49% registered organic for less than 5 years and approximately half of \nthese converted for one year or less. The majority of organic farms were fully \norganic (66%), but 14% contained non-organic land which was unlikely to be \n 12\nconverted. There were significant relationships between the length of time a \nfarm had been registered as organic and a number of variables including; field \nsize - very variable on new organic farms but generally smaller on older \norganic farms (r2=0.04, f 1,84 =4.36, p<0.05), % arable - lower on older organic \nfarms (r2=0.109, f 1,63 =8.80, p<0.01) and % permanent pasture \u2013 higher on older \norganic farms (r2=0.123, f 1,64=10.09, p<0.01). All of these were influenced \nstrongly by the small percentage of farms which had always been organically \nmanaged (6%).  \n \n4. Discussion \nThe study suggests that farm management practices result in greater \ncomplexity on organic farms at the scales investigated which may be \nassociated with positive impacts of organic farming on biodiversity (Bengtsson \net al., 2005) including those found for the farms in this study (see Fuller et al., \n2005).  \n \nThis study also revealed that organic cereal growing farms in England tend to \nbe located in more heterogeneous landscapes towards the south of England \ncharacterised by extensive mixed farming compared to more northerly \nintensive arable areas where non-organic cereal growing is concentrated. \nRundlof and Smith (2006) found similar differences between locations of \norganic and non-organic cereals-growing farms in Sweden. \n \nThe pairing of organic and non-organic farms on the basis of their proximity to \none another ensured that the fact that organic farms tend to be located in \n 13\nheterogeneous landscapes did not account for the differences between \nsystems shown here, i.e. the organic and non-organic farms within a pair were \nlocated within broadly the same landscape types as supported by \ncomparisons at the 25km2 scale. Results for the one and 9km2 surrounding \ntarget fields and for habitat surveys indicated that even within similar relatively \nheterogeneous landscape types organic farms were characterised by higher \nlandscape complexity than was found in their non-organic more arable \ndominated counterparts (see Gibson et al., 2007).  \n \nSupporting management data provided evidence that differences at the farm \nscale may result from the fact that organic farms incorporating cereals were \nmore likely than their non-organic pair to be mixed farms with \u2018older\u2019 organic \nfarms containing the lowest ratios of arable to permanent pasture. Additionally \norganic farmers incorporated grass-clover leys into their rotations and planted \na wider variety of cereal types which were frequently under-sown with a ley. \nGreater complexity of both crop structure and field use at the landscape scale \nis likely to attract a broader range of potentially beneficial species because of \nthe availability of a larger number of different habitat types as opposed to \nmore uniform landscapes (Benton et al., 2003; Weibull et al., 2003; Rundlof \nand Smith 2006; Clough et al., 2007; Oberg et al., 2007). The presence of \nlong-established permanent pasture may be particularly important as a \npermanent habitat for insects (Purtauf et al., 2005). \n   \nIn addition to the complexity resulting from field use, non-crop habitats \ncovered a greater extent in the locality of organic farms and on the farms \n 14\nthemselves than on their non-organic counterparts in both the 1 and 9km2 \nsurrounding the target fields. Habitat surveys revealed that densities (length \nper unit area) of linear features, both hedges and boundaries, were higher on \norganic farms which correlated with the questionnaire finding that fields were \nsmaller on organic farms. The presence of stock on organic farms encourages \nthe maintenance of stock-proof hedges and this is reflected in the hedge \ninformation collected by habitat surveyors indicating that hedges on organic \nfarms were higher, wider and less gappy than those on their non-organic \ncounterparts.  \n \nThe greater extent of non-crop habitat in the vicinity of organic farms is likely \nto be beneficial for biodiversity, e.g. Holzschuh et al. (2007) found that \nlandscape heterogeneity and the availability of semi-natural nesting habitats \nresulted in higher bee diversity on farmland. Smaller field sizes and higher \ndensities of hedges provide a high perimeter to area ratio which is correlated \nwith small scale landscape complexity and higher species richness  as found \nfor plants, butterflies and carabids by Weibull et al. (2003). For organic \nfarmers, the high perimeter to area ratio means that the benefits of the hedges \nextend over a greater area of the farmed land than would be the case if fields \nwere larger. The condition of non-crop features is also important with well \nmaintained continuous hedges providing important corridors for movement of \nspecies including small mammals (Gelling et al., 2007), nesting and feeding \nsites for birds (Chamberlain et al., 2001) as well refuges for plant and \ninvertebrate species. Whilst organic certification bodies do not enforce rules \non the creation or retention of non-crop features as an essential part of the \n 15\nfarming system those practising organic agriculture in accordance with \nmanagement guidelines such as those outlined in Lampkin (1990) recognise \nthe importance of providing non-crop habitats for beneficial insects and other \nwildlife which help to control crop pests  \n \nThe relationship between organic farming and agri-environment scheme \nparticipation was complex at the time of the study as the extent and \nmanagement of farm habitats on organic farms may have made it easier for \norganic farms to enter into agri-environment agreements. The proportion of \nfarms in the wider countryside with an agri-environment scheme at the time of \nthe study was 14% (Defra census and agri-environment scheme data) \ncontrasting with 45% of the non-organic study farms. This indicates that the \nnon-organic farmers in this study were more \u2018wildlife friendly\u2019 than average \nwhich was possibly due to the recruitment process, i.e. farmers being asked to \nbe a part of a biodiversity study may be more likely to agree if they are \ninterested in biodiversity. The similarity of responses to the question of \nwhether they managed for wildlife on their farms between organic and non-\norganic farmers also supported this.  This tendency towards a more\u2019 wildlife \nfriendly\u2019 farming style (see Schmitzberger et al., 2005), coupled to the fact that \nfarms were located close to their pairs (i.e. in a similar landscape context at \nthe coarse scale), makes the observed differences between the farm types \nmore notable. \n \nThe most obvious difference between organic and non-organic farming is that \norganic farmers do not apply synthetic fertilisers or use non-organic pesticides \n 16\n(Anon 2007; Romero et al., 2008). This results in secondary differences \nbetween the systems including timing of sowing and types of crop sown, for \nexample, the use of triticale over wheat as a result of its lower nutrient \ndemand. For most studies looking at organic farming effects on biodiversity \nthese are the overriding factors differentiating organic farming from non-\norganic farming practices, see Gabriel et al. (2005) and Hole et al. (2005).  \n \nOrganic farmers always sowed crops later than their conventional \ncounterparts in order to avoid weed flushes. The difference was particularly \nmarked for winter wheat where non-organic farmers were able to sow earlier \nthrough the use of pesticides in the early stages of crop growth. This ability to \nallow weeds to establish and yet restrict their impacts on crops through \npesticide use enables non-organic farmers to allow natural regeneration on \ncereal stubbles which are a particularly attractive environment for birds \n(Gillings et al., 2005). Organic farmers choose to use fertility building crops on \ntheir set-aside land rather than leave it unmanaged (set-aside on non-organic \nfarms is likely to have been recorded as \u2018other grass\u2019 for landscape context \ncomparisons). Whilst both stubbles and set-aside have been shown to be \nbeneficial to wildlife (Firbank et al., 2003b) it is open to debate as to whether \nthe presence of  naturally regenerating stubble or set-aside fields isolated \nwithin a relatively homogenous landscape at the small scale are better for \nbiodiversity than a system which results in an inherently more heterogeneous \nand weedy landscape at that scale. \n 17\nAcknowledgements \nMany thanks to all the farmers who provided access to their land and the \nvolunteers and fieldworkers who collected data at those sites.
