INTRODUCTION\nNucleation has long been known to be very sensitive to\nimpurities. Very pure water can be cooled to tens of degrees\nbelow freezing, 0 \u00b0C at atmospheric pressure, before it crys-\ntallizes, but in practice the water in our freezers freezes at\nonly a little below 0 \u00b0C [1]. The crystals of ice in our freezer\npresumably nucleate heterogeneously, in contact with some\nunknown impurity in the water. The nucleus of water may be\nonly a few water molecules across and so is only a nanom-\neter or so across. Thus, even impurities only a nanometer\nacross can interact with the nucleus and so greatly reduce the\nfree-energy barrier to nucleation. The impurity may, of\ncourse, be much larger. Often we know little of the impurity\nthat is providing a surface where the nucleus of ice can form\nat a much lower free-energy cost than in the bulk. Here, we\ncircumvent the problem that the impurities are typically un-\ncharacterized, by using a statistical theory. We address the\nquestion: Under what conditions can chance variations from\nsample to sample in the impurities present, cause the nucle-\nation rate to vary significantly from sample to sample? That\nis we develop a theory that links an observable, the variabil-\nity of nucleation rate, with the variability of the impurities at\nmicroscopic length scales.\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of this problem of heteroge-\nneous nucleation occurring on uncharacterised impurities,\nrelatively little theoretical work has been done. Karpov and\nOxtoby [2,3] have considered nucleation in the presence of\nrandom static disorder, and Harrowell and Oxtoby [4] looked\nat the effect of the distribution of time scales present in\nglasses. But this work did not address the problem of sample\nto sample variability, and little theoretical work has been\ndone for a number of years.\nCastro and co-workers [5,6] studied the process that fol-\nlows nucleation, namely, growth. See also Ref. [7]. The pat-\ntern of growth depends on whether nucleation occurs con-\ntinuously throughout the process of phase transformation or\nonly at a few sites near the start of the process. We find\nsample to sample variability occurs when one or a few sites\nhave unusually low nucleation barriers and so there should\nbe a correlation between the pattern of growth (and hence the\nfinal distribution of grain sizes if the new phase forming is\ncrystalline) and sample to sample variability in the nucle-\nation rate. Castro and co-workers consider only growth, they\ndid not explicitly consider nucleation, and they did not con-\nsider sample to sample variability.\nJust as Karpov and Oxtoby did [3], we will consider\nnucleation in the presence of disorder. We will model the\nsystem as a nucleus interacting with random disorder, i.e.,\nthe free energy of the nucleus will contain a part that is a\nrandom variable. Essentially, faced with a situation where we\nknow the free energy barrier to nucleation depends on its\ninteraction with species unknown, we realize that it is not\npossible to base a theoretical description on precise knowl-\nedge and make a plausible simple guess. Individual interac-\ntions are modeled by random variables with some mean and\nstandard deviation and the system is then characterized just\nby these two numbers.\nThe rate of nucleation at a site is proportional to the ex-\nponential of minus the free energy divided by the thermal\nenergy kBT. See the book of Debenedetti [1] or the review of\nOxtoby [8] or of Kashchiev and van Rosmalen [9] for an\nintroduction to nucleation. Thus the rate at a particular site is\nproportional to the Boltzmann factor of the nucleus at that\nsite and so a sum over different sites with different free-\nenergy barriers has the form of a sum over Boltzmann\nweights. This is of course the form of a partition function; a\npartition function of a system where the energies are random\nvariables. Such a system is called the random energy model\n(REM) and was first proposed and studied by Derrida [10].\nHe was using it as a simple model for a glass. We can take\nover much of the analysis of the REM done by Derrida and\napply it to our system. Most importantly, at low temperatures\nthe REM is not self-averaging: different realizations of the\ndisorder give rise to significantly different partition func-\ntions. In our system the analog of the partition function of\nthe REM is the total rate of nucleation, and different realiza-\ntions correspond to different samples prepared in the same\nconditions. So, we have a regime in which the rate is not\nself-averaging: it differs significantly from sample to sample.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 021605 (2004)\n1539-3755\/2004\/70(2)\/021605(8)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society70 021605-1\nNote that this is distinct from variability in properties such as\nthe time until the first nucleus appears. As the crossing of a\nnucleation barrier is a random process the time it takes will\nalways be a random variable, but if there is little or no vari-\nability in the free-energy barrier the rate itself will self-\naverage and so not vary from sample to sample. Having rec-\nognized that our problem is isomorphic to Derrida\u2019s REM we\nhave a model for the experimental observation of sample-to-\nsample variability. This model allows us to obtain quantita-\ntive relations between the width of the distribution of the\nfree-energy barriers to nucleation, the number of nucleation\nsites, and the sample-to-sample variability.\nThe next section is a very general study of nucleation with\na free energy barrier that contains a term that is a random\nvariable. The number of nucleation sites Ns is fixed, although\nour theory can be generalized to deal with varying amounts\nof impurity nucleation sites, see Sec. II B. Section III is de-\nvoted to the study of an explicit model of a disordered sys-\ntem: a surface composed of two types of monomers that are\ndistributed at random. Figure 1 is a schematic of this model.\nWe show how this random distribution of monomers leads to\na random term in the free energy of a nucleus in contact with\nthe surface and obtain an explicit expression for the width w\nof the distribution of free-energy barriers. The model of Fig.\n1 is just one possible system that results in a random term in\nthe free-energy barrier to nucleation, we can envisage many\nothers. Indeed other activated processes with the same expo-\nnential dependence on the height of a free-energy barrier,\nsuch as protein unfolding [11], have essentially the same\nbehavior in the presence of disorder. Disorder can be a model\nnot only for uncharacterized impurities but also for very\ncomplex environments such as that inside a living cell. Sec-\ntion IV outlines the use of Bayes\u2019s theorem to estimate the\nnucleation rate from a small number of observations of\nnucleation. This is useful as if the nucleation rate can be\nestimated for two different samples and shown to be different\nin these two samples, the experimental system must be in the\nnon-self-averaging regime. The last section is a conclusion.\nII. GENERAL THEORY\nNucleation is an activated process [1,8,9]. As such, its rate\nhas an exponential dependence on the free-energy barrier to\nnucleation DF* the free energy of the critical nucleus. The\ncritical nucleus is, by definition, the nucleus at the top of the\nbarrier to nucleation [1]. Thus, if at site i of the system, the\nfree energy barrier is DFi\n*\n, and the frequency of attempts at\nunfolding is ni, then the rate of nucleation at the site i is\nRi = ni exps\u2212 DFi*d . s1d\nWe will assume that the attempt frequency ni is only weakly\ndependent on i and so treat it as a constant: ni=n. As DFi\n* is\nexponentiated, if it varies appreciably then its variation\ndominates that of ni which can then be neglected. We use\nunits such that the thermal energy kBT=1. If the system con-\nsists of Ns possible sites for nucleation then the average\nnucleation rate per site is simply\nR = Ns\n\u22121o\ni=1\nNs\nRi s2d\n=Ns\n\u22121no\ni=1\nNs\nexps\u2212 DFi*d . s3d\nThus to calculate the nucleation rate we require the Ns values\nof the nucleation barrier at all possible nucleation sites.\nOften, the system of interest is complex, or poorly char-\nacterized with unknown impurities present. Then, we have\nlittle hope of determining all the Ns values of DFi\n*\n. To deal\nwith these situations we resort to a statistical approach: we\nguess the values of DFi\n*\n. We do this by picking the DFi\n* from\na probability distribution function that is characterized by\ntwo parameters, its mean m and standard deviation w. These\ntwo parameters can in turn be obtained from a model, esti-\nmated from experimental data, or simply varied to see what\nqualitative behavior is possible. We estimate them from a\nspecific model in Sec. III.\nIt is convenient to express the DFi\n* as a mean plus a de-\nviation,\nDFi\n*\n= m + di, s4d\nwhere di is a random variable with zero mean, it is the de-\nviation of the nucleation barrier at site i from its mean value\nm. Taking the probability distribution of di , psdid, to be a\nGaussian, we have\npsdid =\nexpf\u2212 di2\/s2w2dg\ns2pw2d1\/2\n. s5d\nUsing Eq. (4) for DFi\n* we can write Eq. (3) as\nR = Ns\n\u22121n exps\u2212 mdo\ni=1\nNs\nexps\u2212 did . s6d\nNow, with the DFi\n* independent random variables, the rate of\nEq. (6) is, except for constant factors, equivalent to the par-\ntition function of the random energy model (REM) of Der-\nrida [10]. The REM is a simple and well understood model\nof glasses and other disordered systems that undergo a tran-\nsition to a state that is non-self-averaging.\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Schematic representation of a nucleus\nrepresented by a 33333 cube of dark blue monomers, in contact\nwith a flat surface composed of two types of monomers: light and\ndark yellow.\nRICHARD P. SEAR PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 021605 (2004)\n021605-2\nJust as in the REM the average partition function can be\nobtained, we can obtain the average, over realisations of the\ndisorder, of the nucleation rate R,\nkRl = Ns\n\u22121n exps\u2212 mdKo\ni=1\nNs\nexps\u2212 didL s7d\n=n exps\u2212 m + w2\/2d . s8d\nIf the rate R is self-averaging then for almost all realizations\nR will be close to kRl and the right-hand side of Eq. (8) will\nbe a good approximation to the nucleation rate of almost all\nrealizations of our model. But if the rate R is not self-\naveraging then Eq. (8) will not be a good approximation and\nthe rate R will differ appreciably from one realization to\nanother. Nucleation in the presence of random static disorder\nwas considered by Karpov and Oxtoby [3] who obtained\nresults similar to that of Eq. (8), but they only considered\nself-averaging systems.\nA. Measures of non-self-averaging behavior\nWe will now look at how as the width of the distribution\nof free-energy barriers w increases the behavior ceases to be\nself-averaging. First, we will look at how many nucleation\nsites contribute significant amounts to the nucleation rate in a\ntypical realization. If this number is large then as the sites are\nassumed independent the rate is a sum of a large number of\nindependent random variables and so will be self-averaging,\nwhereas if it is small this will not be the case.\nFrom Eq. (6) we see that the rate R is dominated by sites\nwith values of ni where the product of the number of sites\nand exps\u2212did, is a maximum. The number of sites is simply\nproportional to the probability of Eq. (5). The maximum of\nthe product psdidexps\u2212did is at a value of d,\ndmax = \u2212 w\n2\n. s9d\nNow, the average number of sites around this value of di is\njust Nspsdmaxd, and because this average is a sum over inde-\npendent random variables (the ni) the ratio of the fluctuations\nto the mean scales as fNspsdmaxdg\u22121\/2. Thus the fluctuations in\nthe number of sites that contribute the dominant amount to\nthe rate, and hence the fluctuations in the rate itself are small\nrelative to the mean if and only if Nspsdmaxd@1. From Eqs.\n(5) and (9) this is true whenever 2 ln Ns\u2212w2.0.\nThus, the boundary between self-averaging and non-self-\naveraging regimes is given by the equation\n2 ln Ns \u2212 w2 = 0. s10d\nThus the rate is self-averaging if and only if the logarithm of\nthe number of possible sites for nucleation, is larger than half\nthe variance of the nucleation barrier. This is the main result\nof this work. It is a very general result, i.e., it applies gener-\nally to activated processes in a random or near-random envi-\nronment. Our conclusions here apply to any process with a\nrate given by an equation of the form of Eq. (3). In the next\nsection we will give the example of heterogeneous nucle-\nation at a disordered surface and in Ref. [11], we showed that\nit held for a model of protein unfolding in vivo.\nIn the non-self-averaging regime, a single unfolding site\ncan be responsible for a significant fraction of the entire rate.\nThis site must of course be the site with the lowest, i.e., most\nnegative, value of di. We denote this lowest value by x. We\ncan easily find an estimate for x, which we call dev. It is\nsimply the value of d at which the mean number density,\nNspsdid, of sites drops below 1. This is easy to see: it cannot\nbe much below the value of d for which Nspsdd<1 as there\nare rarely any sites at all below this value and it cannot be\nmuch above it as for these values of d there are many sites.\nThus, we have that dev satisfies the equation Nspsdevd=1, and\nso is given by\ndev = \u2212 s2 ln Nsd1\/2 w , s11d\nwhere to obtain this result we ignored the denominator of Eq.\n(5).\nSo when a single site dominates the rate R, and has a\nvalue of di close to dev, the rate is approximately\nRT . Ns\n\u22121n expf\u2212 m + s2 ln Nsd1\/2 wg , s12d\nusing Eq. (11) in Eq. (6). Note that RT! kRl for large widths,\nkRl increases as the exponential of w2, Eq. (8), whereas RT\nincreases as only the exponential of w. Equation (9) tells us\nthat at, for example, w=6 the maximum contribution to the\naverage rate kRl comes from sites with values of d around\ndmax=36. At these values of d the probability density (5) is\nclose to 10\u22129. Thus even for Ns=108 there is on average less\nthan one site at values of d close to dmax. For Ns=108 most\nrealizations have no sites around dmax=36, and so have val-\nues of R rather less than its mean value kRl, and closer to RT.\nThe large value of kRl is due to a few realizations with very\nlarge values of R.\nOur analysis started with Eq. (1), the standard expression\nfor the rate of a barrier-crossing process. This is only valid if\nthere is a barrier to cross, i.e., if m+di is at least a few kBT.\nIf there are sites present for which m+di is close to zero,\nwhich is true if m\u2212 s2 ln Nsd1\/2w&0 [Eq. (11)], then the\nnucleation rate at these sites will be essentially n. In this case\nwe would expect these sites to dominate the nucleation rate\nas nuclei form effectively immediately at these sites. The rate\nwill then be self-averaging if and only if the average number\nof these sites in a sample is much larger than one. In the\nremainder of the manuscript we will assume that m\n\u2212 s2 ln Nsd1\/2w is at least a few kBT.\nAlso, Eq. (12) is for the rate when it is dominated by a\nsingle site. We would expect that often when nucleation has\noccurred at a site the growing domain of the nucleated phase\nwill prevent the formation of further nuclei at this site. If this\nis so then once the first nucleus has formed then the rate R\nwill decrease as then only the other sites with higher free-\nenergy barriers to nucleation will remain. Thus associated\nwith non-self-averaging nucleation rates we expect rates that\nare time dependent. When the rate R contains contributions\nfrom many sites, clearly the rate will only decrease after\nmany nuclei have formed and so any time dependence will\nbe much less noticeable. The rates R considered here are\ntherefore initial rates. As determining the time dependence of\nrates requires study of the behavior of nuclei after they have\nSTATISTICAL THEORY OF NUCLEATION IN THE \u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 021605 (2004)\n021605-3\ncrossed the barrier we do not consider this time dependence\nhere, although see Refs. [5,6] for post-nucleation growth in\nsystems with distributions of nucleation barriers.\nWe will now perform a quantitative analysis of the frac-\ntion of the rate due to the site with the lowest free-energy\nbarrier, i.e., due to the one with di=x. We calculate the av-\nerage fev of the fraction of the rate due to the site with the\nlowest free-energy barrier. This can be calculated from the\nprobability distribution function pevsxd using\nfev =\nn exps\u2212 md\nNskRl\nE pevsxdexps\u2212 xddx . s13d\nWe can simplify Eq. (13) by introducing the reduced variable\ny=x \/w. Then, from Eq. (13) and using Eq. (8) for kRl, we\nobtain\nfev = Ns\u22121 exps\u2212 w2\/2d E dypevsydexps\u2212 wyd , s14d\nwhere pevsyd is the probability distribution function for the\nminimum value of a set of Ns values taken from a Gaussian\nof zero mean and unit standard deviation. Note that although\nthe absolute value of the rate R and of the contribution of the\nextreme value both depend on the mean m, fev does not. It\ndepends only on w and Ns.\nThe determination of pevsyd is a standard problem in\nextreme-value statistics [12]. We start from the fact that the\nprobability that the minimum of Ns values is y is the prob-\nability that 1 of the Ns sites has a value y, and all the remain-\ning Ns\u22121 sites have larger values, multiplied by Ns, as any\none of the Ns sites can have the lowest value. Thus,\npevsyd = Nspsydp.\nNs\u22121syd , s15d\nwhere psyd is a normalized Gaussian of zero mean and unit\nstandard deviation, and p.syd fp,sydg is the probability of\nobtaining a number larger (lower) than y from a Gaussian of\nzero mean and unit standard deviation. We are interested in\nthe region where x is several standard deviations below the\nmean, y!\u22121. Now, p.=1\u2212 p,, and so as for y!\u22121, p,\n!1, we can rewrite Eq. (15) as\npevsyd . Nspsydexpf\u2212 Nsp,sydg , s16d\nwhere we replaced Ns\u22121 by Ns. Also, p,syd= s1\/2d\n3erfcs\u2212y \/21\/2d, which for y!\u22121 simplifies to\np,syd . exps\u2212 y2d\/fs2pd1\/2s\u2212 ydg . s17d\nIn Fig. 2 we have plotted the fraction of the rate due to the\nsite with the lowest barrier fev as a function of w. We took\nNs=104 ,108 , and 1012. For protein crystallization [13] dis-\ntinct sites should be at least 1 nm apart. Then Ns=108 sites\ncorresponds to a surface of order 100 mm2. The dependence\non Ns is logarithmic, varying Ns by orders of magnitude does\nnot have a marked effect. ln Ns should nearly always be of\norder 10. We see that as w increases, so does fev. For Ns\n=108, Eq. (10) is satisfied for w=6.07. For w around this\nvalue the site with the largest interaction energy already con-\ntributes a large amount to the total rate, on average. This\nlarge contribution will vary significantly from one realization\nto the next, and so the fraction of the rate due to the site with\nthe lowest value of the nucleation barrier will vary substan-\ntially from realization to realization at large w. For some\nrealizations it will be rather larger than fev and for others it\nwill be much smaller. Whereas of course if w is small the\nrate R has significant contributions from many unfolding\nsites and so varies weakly from realization to realization,\nessentially due to variations in the rate being averaged out in\naccordance with the central-limit theorem.\nB. Variable Ns\nThere is data on the effect of impurities from the work of\nTurnbull [14] and co-workers, and that of Perpezko and co-\nworkers [15] on nucleation from dispersions of liquid drop-\nlets [1,8]. These experiments were motivated by the idea that\nif sufficiently small droplets could be formed some droplets\nwould be free of all impurities and in those droplets the\nnucleation would then be homogeneous. It is not clear that\nthis objective was achieved [1,8,15]. Perpezko [15] assumed\nthat the impurities are randomly distributed, and then the\nnumber of impurity particles in a droplet is given by a Pois-\nson distribution function. He addressed the question of ran-\ndom variation in the number of impurity particles but not\nthat of variation in the interaction of the impurity with the\nnucleus. Thus in a sense it is complementary to this work. If\nwe make the number of sites Ns itself a random variable but\nset w=0 then we obtain the model of Perpezko [15]. Thus if\nwe allow the number of nucleation sites Ns to be a random\nvariable while maintaining w nonzero we have a model that\ncan describe both variation in both the number of impurity\nparticles and disorder in the surface of these particles. We\nleave such a generalization to future work.\nIII. DISORDERED SURFACES\nIn the previous section we merely assumed that the pres-\nence of disorder introduced a random part di into the nucle-\nation barrier at site i, and that the di are drawn from a Gauss-\nian distribution. In this section we will start from a simple\nFIG. 2. The mean fraction fev of the rate R that is due to the site\nwith the lowest di, as a function of the width of the Gaussian w.

The\nnucleus is taken to be a block of monomers of single type\nwhich may be the same type as some of those of the surface\nor different. We assume that not more than one monomer can\noccupy a site, thus the nucleus can be in contact with the\nsurface and so interact with it but it cannot penetrate the\nsurface. Apart from this excluded-volume interaction, the\nonly interactions are those between monomers in contact. If\nthe surface were uniform, i.e., composed exclusively of one\ntype of monomer then the free energy barrier to nucleation\nwould of course be the same at every point on the surface.\nHowever, if the surface is composed of two types of mono-\nmers that are not uniformly distributed then the barrier will\nvary from point to point, depending on the numbers of\nmonomers of the different types that the nucleus is in contact\nwith at a particular point. A schematic of a cubic nucleus in\ncontact with such a surface is shown in Fig. 1.\nLet us call the two types of monomers A and B, and\nassume they are distributed at random. Let monomers of type\nA and B interact with the nucleus with energies eA and eB,\nrespectively. Then the shift in the barrier to nucleation when\nthe nucleus is at a site i in contact with the surface is\nDFi\n*\n= DF0\n* + nieA + snc \u2212 nideB, s18d\nwhere DF0\n* is the nucleation barrier when the the nucleus is\nnot in contact with the surface. nc is the total number of sites\nin the nucleus that contact the surface; as the surface is taken\nto be planar this number is taken to be a constant. ni is the\nnumber of A monomers of the surface in contact with the\nnucleus when the nucleus is at site i. If the monomers of the\nsurface are either A or B at random, then the probability of\nany one of the nc sites of the surface being an A-type mono-\nmer is just the fraction of A-type monomers, which we de-\nnote by fA. Then the probability of the nucleus being in con-\ntact with ni A-type monomers and nc\u2212ni B-type monomers is\njust\npAsnid =\nnc!\nni ! snc \u2212 nid!\nfAnis1 \u2212 fAdnc\u2212ni s19d\n.\nexp f\u2212 sni \u2212 msd2\/s2ws\n2dg\ns2pws\n2d1\/2\n, s20d\nwhere the mean value ms= fAnc, and the variance of the\nGaussian ws\n2\n=ncfAs1\u2212 fAd.\nUsing Eqs. (4), (18), and (20) we see that the Gaussian\ndistribution for ni becomes a Gaussian distribution for di of\nvariance\nw2 = ws\n2seA \u2212 eBd2 = ncfAs1 \u2212 fAdseA \u2212 eBd2. s21d\nThe mean value of the DFi\n* of Eq. (4) is\nm = DF0\n* + ncffA eA + s1 \u2212 fAdeBg . s22d\nFor the nucleation rate to be non-self-averaging we re-\nquire that w2 be larger than 2 ln Ns, Eq. (10). Unless Ns is\nextremely large or small 2 ln Ns will be of order 10. From\nEq. (21) we see that if the difference in interaction energy\nbetween the two types of monomer, eA\u2212eB is a few kBT, and\nif we have around nc=10 sites of the surface in contact with\nthe nucleus, then w2 will be around 10 to 30, providing that\nfA is neither very small nor close to unity. Thus, we predict\nthat heterogeneous nucleation at disordered surfaces com-\nposed of significant fractions of different species whose in-\nteractions with the nucleus differ by a few kBT, will often be\ndominated by one or a few sites. It will therefore vary ap-\npreciably between realizations. Experimentally, this means\nthat the rate will differ appreciably between nominally iden-\ntical samples.\nFinally, for the purposes of comparison we consider ad-\nsorption onto the surface of individual monomers. These\nmonomers are of the same type as those that made up the\nnucleus. For simplicity we do so in the regime where we\nhave much less than a monolayer, i.e., where the number of\nadsorbed monomers G!Ns. Now, we can compare the rate R\nwith the adsorbed amount G in order to get a feel for which\nproperty is more likely to be non-self-averaging. When G\n!Ns then few pairs of adjacent sites are occupied and so we\ncan treat each surface site as independent. Then G is given by\nG = o\ni=1\nNs expfm + nieA + s1 \u2212 nideBg\n1 + expfm + nieA + s1 \u2212 nideBg\n, s23d\nwhere ni=1 if the monomer at site i on the surface is an\nA-type monomer and ni=0 if the monomer is a B-type mono-\nmer. m is the chemical potential of the monomers (in units of\nkBT). The variation of G from realization to realization will\ndepend on eA ,eB , fA, and m.\nHowever, this variability simply comes from the fact that\nthe terms in the sum of Eq. (23) take one of two values\ndepending on whether the monomer is type A or type B.\nThese two values are bounded by 0 and 1. Thus we can\neasily obtain an upper bound for this variation in G by as-\nsuming the terms in the sum for G, Eq. (23) are either 0 or 1.\nThis corresponds to, say, the A-type monomers always hav-\ning a monomer adsorbed onto them while the B-type mono-\nmers never have an adsorbed monomer. For definiteness we\nassume that A-type monomers are the ones with adsorbed\nmonomers. This approximation will clearly overestimate the\nvariability in G but even within this approximation the vari-\nance of G is just fAs1\u2212 fAdNs for large Ns. The ratio of the\nstandard deviation to the mean fANs is then given by\nstd. dev.\nmean\n= S1 \u2212 fAfA D\n1\/2\nNs\n\u22121\/2 s24d\nand so is small for large Ns and fA=Os0.1d. At least when the\nadsorption is small G is self-averaging. So disorder large\nenough to cause the rate R to be non-self-averaging may\nleave other properties, e.g., G, still self-averaging. As the\nnucleus is large, nc=Os10d, the variance in the free-energy\nbarrier at a site is large [it is multiplied by nc in Eq. (21)] and\nSTATISTICAL THEORY OF NUCLEATION IN THE \u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 021605 (2004)\n021605-5\nthe rate R is then proportional to the exponential of this large\nquantity. Both the factor of nc and the exponentiation\nstrongly enhance the effect of disorder and make the nucle-\nation rate one of the most likely properties of a system to be\nnon-self-averaging.\nIV. DETERMINING THE NUCLEATION RATE USING\nBAYESIAN INFERENCE\nIn this section we will discuss the use of Bayesian infer-\nence to determine the probable nucleation rate from measure-\nments of nucleation, and hence determine whether or not two\n(or more) different samples have the same or different nucle-\nation rates. This is required as observing the effects of dis-\norder on nucleation is hampered by the fact that nucleation is\ninherently a random process. There is more than one way to\nstudy nucleation and inference should be applicable to all of\nthem, but for definiteness and because our nucleation rates R\nare initial nucleation rates we study determining the rate of\nnucleation from the time until the first nucleus appears. For-\ntunately, the inference problem we need to solve is the same\nas that given and solved as an example in chapter 3 of the\ntextbook of MacKay [16]. We shall therefore give only a\nbrief presentation, referring the reader for details to Ref.\n[16].\nNucleation is due to a fluctuation and so is random even\nin a completely uniform pure system. The time t at which the\nfirst nucleus appears is a random variable. The probability\ndistribution function for t is an exponential,\npstd = RNs exps\u2212 RNstd . s25d\nExperiments can also involve counting the number of events,\nand if these events are independent this number is given by a\nPoisson distribution function. For example Galkin and Veki-\nlov [17,18] count the number of protein crystals formed. The\nanalysis here can also be applied to determine whether or not\ntwo Poisson distributions have different means. If they have\nthen that too indicates a varying nucleation rate.\nLet us consider the situation where we have two samples\nthat have been prepared in the same way. If we can deter-\nmine that they have different nucleation rates then clearly we\nmust be in the non-self-averaging regime whereas if we ex-\namine a number of samples and they all have indistinguish-\nable rates then we are in the self-averaging regime. A given\nsample will have some unknown total nucleation rate RNs. If\nwe determine the time t at which a nucleus appears NA times,\nthen we will have NA values, t1 to tNA, drawn from the dis-\ntribution of Eq. (25). We denote this set of times by htj.\nWe now need Bayes\u2019s theorem, which is [16]\nPsRNsuhtjd =\np0sRNsdpshtjuRNsd\nE p0sRNsdpshtjuRNsddsRNsd\n, s26d\nwhere PsRNs u htjd is the probability we want: it is the prob-\nability that the rate is RNs given the set of measured nucle-\nation times htj. Also, p0sRNsd is the prior probability distri-\nbution, the probability distribution before we made the\nmeasurements, and pshtj uRNsd is the probability of observing\nthe set of nucleation times htj given that the nucleation rate is\nRNs. This last probability is easily obtained from Eq. (25)\nwhich gives the probability of observing a single value of t\ngiven the rate. As the measurements are independent,\npshtj uRNsd is simply given by\npshtjuRNsd ~ sRNsdNA Pi=1\nNA exps\u2212 RNstid s27d\n~ sRNsdNA exps\u2212 RNstsd , s28d\nwhere ts is the sum of the NA measurements\nts = o\ni=1\nNA\nti. s29d\nThe sign ~ indicates that we have dropped a normalization\nconstant. We can restore normalization at the end of the cal-\nculation.\nUsing Eq. (28) in Eq. (26) we obtain the probability dis-\ntribution function of the rate\nPsRNsuhtjd = cp0sRNsdsRNsdNA exps\u2212 RNstsd , s30d\nwhere c is just a constant of normalization,\nc\u22121 =E p0sRNsdsRNsdNA exps\u2212 RNstsd d sRNsd . s31d\nWe have considered a pair of randomly generated sys-\ntems. Each has Ns=104 sites with free-energy barriers taken\nfrom a distribution with mean m=20 and standard deviation\nw=3. We generate two realizations, the first has a total nucle-\nation rate RNs=3.623310\u22123n and the second has RNs\n=1.575310\u22123n. To employ Bayesian inference we require a\nprior distribution for the total rate p0sRNsd. We pick a top hat\nfunction\np0sRNsd = HR0\u22121 RNs \u0142 R0,0 RNs . R0.J s32d\nOther reasonable priors give similar results, as they should.\nWe have numerically generated sets of NA=20 nucleation\ntimes for both systems and used both sets of values in Eq.\n(3). The two resulting probability distribution functions\nPsRNs u htjd are plotted in Fig. 3. We used a prior of width\nR0=5310\u22122n. Even with such a broad prior, 20 measure-\nments are clearly enough to demonstrate that it is very likely\nthat the two systems have different nucleation rates. Thus,\nthe use of Bayes\u2019s theorem in this way is an effective way of\ndetermining that the rate is varying from sample to sample,\nand so the rate is not self-averaging.\nV. CONCLUSION\nNucleation often occurs with the nucleus interacting with,\nand with a free energy strongly reduced by, impurities. This\nis called heterogeneous nucleation. Here, we have addressed\nthe question: Under what conditions can chance variations\nfrom sample to sample in the impurities present, cause the\nnucleation rate to vary significantly from sample to sample?\nIn the previous section we showed how Bayes\u2019s theorem\nRICHARD P. SEAR PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 021605 (2004)\n021605-6\nallows an efficient estimation of the nucleation rate in a\nsample and so allows variations in this rate to be detected. As\nthe impurities are typically uncharacterized and uncontrolled\nwe resorted to a statistical theory to model chance, i.e., ran-\ndom, variations in the impurities. The impurities were mod-\neled by quenched disorder and we showed that the rate of\nnucleation has the same form as the partition function of\nDerrida\u2019s random energy model [10]. There is a regime\nwhere the nucleation rate in different samples prepared in the\nsame way may be different, where it is non-self-averaging.\nThis occurs when the width w of the distribution of nucle-\nation barriers is large. The crossover from this regime to the\nregime where the nucleation rate is very similar in different\nsamples occurs at a width w given by Eq. (10). The nucle-\nation rate is very sensitive to disorder in the sense that it may\nbe non-self-averaging even when other properties may still\nbe self-averaging. This is in accord with experiment where\nnucleation is known to be highly sensitive to impurities [15].\nOur study of a specific model of nucleation at a disordered\nsurface (Sec. III) showed that, at least within this model, the\norigin of this sensitivity lies in the fact that the nucleus is\nquite large, it consists of not one but many molecules, and\nthat the rate is proportional to the exponential of the free-\nenergy barrier. Nucleation is important in a number of fields,\nfor example, it is crucial for protein crystallization [13]. The\ncrystal phase of proteins is required for x-ray determination\nof their structure.\nThe method of direct observations of nucleation and ap-\nplying Bayes\u2019s theorem is not the only way of estimating the\neffect of disorder on nucleation. An alternative way is to\nfollow the fraction of the system that has undergone the\nphase transition as a function of time. The evolution over\ntime t of this fraction, which we denote by Xstd, is often\ndescribed using the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami\n(KJMA) theory [5,6], according to which\nXstd = 1 \u2212 exps\u2212 Atmd , s33d\nwhere A is a constant that depends on both the rate of nucle-\nation and the rate of growth of the droplets\/crystallites of the\nnew phase. Equation (33) is sometimes referred to as\nAvrami\u2019s law. If the nucleation rate is uniform throughout the\nsystem, the exponent m=d+1 with d the dimensionality of\nspace. The power of d+1 contains a power of d due to the\nfact that if the growth front of the domains of the new phase\nis moving at a constant velocity v, then the volume of a\ndomain scales as svtdd. The additional power of time comes\nfrom the fact that for uniform nucleation the number of do-\nmains increases linearly with time t. However, if nucleation\nis not uniform but occurs at just a few sites then nucleation\nmay occur at early times at these sites, and then nucleation\nceases as the sites with low free-energy barriers have been\n\u201cused up.\u201d Then the KJMA exponent m equals d not d+1.\nThe nucleation rates R calculated here are initial rates, when\nthe rate R is dominated by a few sites it will decrease as they\nare \u201cused up.\u201d Thus, as has been discussed by Castro and\nco-workers [5,6], disorder can result in deviations from a\nsimple KJMA growth law with exponent m=3, in two di-\nmensions. See Refs. [5,6] for calculations showing effective\nexponents between 2 and 3. We would expect that non-self-\naveraging systems, where nucleation occurs predominantly\nat one or a few sites, should exhibit an exponent near to m\n=2. It should be noted that they point out that m alone is a\nnot a particularly discriminating and that if the new phase\nforming is crystalline, then the grain size distribution pro-\nvides more information.\nFinally, Harrowell and Oxtoby [4] have discussed the ef-\nfects of the rapidly increasing relaxation time, essentially our\nn\u22121, and heterogeneity present in a glass. Of course, glassy\nsystems show non-self-averaging behavior. Future work\ncould study non-self-averaging behavior of the nucleation\nrate in glasses.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge that this work has ben-\nefited greatly from discussions with J.
