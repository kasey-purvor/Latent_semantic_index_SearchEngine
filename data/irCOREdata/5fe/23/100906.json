INTRODUCTION\nCharged particles emitted into vacuum, and drawn by an\napplied voltage toward an \u201cextractor\u201d electrode, constitute a\n\u201cvacuum space charge.\u201d If large enough, this space charge\nreduces the emitter surface field and limits the emission cur-\nrent for given applied voltage. This can occur with both ther-\nmally and field-induced emissions, but differences in detail\nmake it best to treat these separately. In this paper, the terms\n\u201cemission\u201d and \u201cfield emission\u201d cover both electron and ion\nemission.\nThe theory of thermally emitted vacuum space charge\nderives from the papers of Child1 and Langmuir.2,3 Although\nJaff\u00e9\u2019s4 1920 analysis is relevant, the theory of field-emitted\nvacuum space charge \u0001FEVSC\u0002 properly begins with the\n1929 paper of Stern et al.,5 which followed up the well-\nknown work of Fowler and Nordheim6 \u0001FN\u0002 on the basic\ntheory of cold field electron emission \u0001CFE\u0002. Subsequently,\nCockburn,7 Ivey,8 Barbour et al.,9 and many others \u0001includ-\ning Refs. 10\u201336\u0002, developed relevant theory and applied it to\nspecific problems. Treatments of FEVSC, based on applying\nMonte Carlo methods to the emission process, are embedded\nin commercial and other computer programs37\u201340 used to\nanalyze the optical properties of electron and ion systems.\nThis paper aims to make FEVSC effects \u0001and the asso-\nciated mathematics\u0002 easier to understand by presenting an\nalternative mathematical treatment of the basic one-\ndimensional \u00011D\u0002 planar-geometry FEVSC model. It in-\nvolves a dimensionless biquadratic equation, Eqs. \u000114a\u0002 and\n\u000114b\u0002 below, that I call the dimensionless planar FEVSC\nequation. This differs from other reported dimensionless FE-\nVSC equations.7,8,15,26,30,33 Equations \u000114a\u0002 and \u000114b\u0002 have\nan exact solution for the field reduction factor \u0002 in terms of\nthe FEVSC \u201cstrength\u201d \u0001 \u0001see definitions below\u0002. The main\nempirical parameters involved \u0001V , FP , FL , JP, and JL be-\nlow\u0002 have definitions that make them positive for both posi-\ntive and negative particle emissions. The theory applies to\nany form of field-induced charged-particle emission, pro-\nvided that all particles are the same and have, at emission, a\nnarrow range of kinetic energy near zero.\nIn technology, FEVSC effects can help \u0001as when they\nstabilize an emission current\u0002, or hinder \u0001as when they inhibit\nsharp focusing of particle beams\u0002. Contexts where improved\nFEVSC theory may be useful include the liquid metal ion\nsource \u0001LMIS\u000236,41 \u0001used in focused ion beam machines42\nand the field emission electric propulsion of spacecraft43\u0002,\nSpindt arrays,27,28,44 and the proposed use of carbon nano-\ntubes as bright field electron sources \u0001e.g., Ref. 45\u0002. There\nalso remains an older problem with field electron emitters. At\nhigh emission current densities, small departures are\nobserved9 from the behavior predicted by the standard FN-\ntype emission model;46,47 both model breakdown and FE-\nVSC effects have been suggested as causes,48,49 but the true\nexplanation is still not firmly decided.

A 1D planar-geometry model has obvious limitations,\nbut also advantages, in that it can be treated analytically and\nhas clear numerical predictions. These provide a lower\nbound \u0001\u201cworst case scenario\u201d\u0002 for the predicted onset of FE-\nVSC effects, even for nonplanar geometries.\nTo deal correctly with FEVSC effects in real geometries,\nvery complex models are needed that often involve extensive\ncomputation. When developing such models and interpreting\noutputs, better understanding of the basic 1D planar model\nmight be helpful. As suggested below, it might be possible to\nadjust its solution empirically, for use as an approximation\napplicable to specified nonplanar geometries.\nThe 1D planar model uses a classical-continuum ap-\nproach to replace the real behavior of emitted particles by the\nclassical behavior of their time-average charge distribution.\nThis will be adequate for some aspects of source behavior, in\nparticular, time-average current\/voltage characteristics and\nthe average FEVSC-induced surface field reduction. How-\never the model cannot describe aspects determined by sto-\nchastic Coulomb interactions34 between individual emitted\nparticles \u0001namely, energy-distribution broadening and trajec-\ntory displacement\u0002. Also, the model is not exact for particles\naccelerated to relativistic velocities.16\nThe paper\u2019s structure is as follows. Sec. II derives the\ndimensionless planar FEVSC equation and its exact solu-\ntions. Sec. III discusses approximate solutions. Sec. IV\nshows how the usual cubic equation,9 linking current density,\nand applied voltage, relates to the derived equation. Sec. V\npresents some illustrative applications. Sec. VI comments on\nthe possibility of developing an approximate form of solu-\ntion for nonplanar geometry. Sec. VII notes limitations due\nto relativistic mass increase. Sec. VIII provides a summary.\nAppendix 1 notes mathematical features of the analytical so-\nlution of cubic equations.\nAspects of these results have been reported in outline\nelsewhere.53\nII. THEORETICAL DERIVATIONS\nA. Definitions and conventions\nIn this paper, e denotes the elementary positive charge,\nne the magnitude of the charge on the emitted particle, m its\nmass, and \u00030 the electric constant. The emission geometry is\na pair of plane-parallel plates \u0001the \u201cemitter\u201d and the \u201cextrac-\ntor\u201d\u0002 a distance xD apart, with a voltage of magnitude V\nbetween them. Distance from the emitter\u2019s surface \u0001defined\nas the plane where particles emerge with zero kinetic energy\u0002\nis denoted by x. The field magnitude at this surface is de-\nnoted by FP, and a field-induced emission process creates an\nemission current density of magnitude JP. All of n, V, FP,\nand JP are thus positive, for both positively and negatively\ncharged particles.\nStrictly, the symbol V represents the magnitude, not of\nthe applied voltage difference, but of the classical electro-\nstatic potential difference between the surfaces of the extrac-\ntor and emitter. If a contact potential difference exists due to\nwork function differences, then the difference in classical\nelectrostatic potential may differ from that in applied voltage\nby up to a few volts. In FEVSC theory, this distinction be-\ntween electrostatic potential and voltage may nearly always\nbe disregarded; so this paper follows the literature in refer-\nring to V as the \u201capplied voltage.\u201d\nFollowing Mair\u2019s19 terminology, the magnitude FP of the\nreal emitter surface field \u0001whether significant space charge is\npresent or not\u0002 is called the \u201cPoisson surface field,\u201d and the\nmagnitude JP of the corresponding real emission current den-\nsity is called the \u201cPoisson emission current density.\u201d For the\nsame system geometry54 and applied voltage, the emitter sur-\nface field that would exist in the absence of emission \u0001and\nhence the absence of space charge\u0002 is called the \u201cLaplace\nsurface field\u201d and is denoted by FL. The emission current\ndensity that would correspond to a surface field of magnitude\nFL is called the \u201cLaplace emission current density\u201d and de-\nnoted by JL.\nThe \u201cfield reduction factor\u201d \u0002 is defined by\n\u0002 = FP\/FL. \u00011\u0002\nAs shown below, the parameter \u0002 is a function of the space-\ncharge strength \u0001. For a given system geometry, a space\ncharge of high strength greatly reduces FP below the Laplace\nvalue FL.\nIn classical electrostatics, the relationship between FL\nand V is determined by system geometry and can be written\nas\nFL = \u0004LV , \u00012\u0002\nwhere \u0001following the convention of Barbour et al.9\u0002 the sym-\nbol \u0004 denotes voltage-to-surface-field conversion factor.\nHere, \u0004L denotes its Laplace value, i.e., its value in the ab-\nsence of space charge \u0001thus our \u201c\u0004L\u201d is the same as the \u201c\u0004\u201d\nof Barbour et al.9\u0002. In the presence of emission and space\ncharge, a \u201cPoisson conversion factor\u201d \u0004P is defined by\nFP = \u0004PV . \u00013\u0002\nFor given system geometry, \u0004L is independent of applied\nvoltage, provided that no voltage-dependent field penetration\nor similar effects occur, and that the emitter work function is\nuniform \u0001so no patch fields55 are present\u0002. However, \u0004P de-\npends on applied voltage and will be significantly less than\n\u0004L when the space-charge strength is high, because \u0004P\n=\u0002\u0004L.\nObviously, for a system geometry consisting of a classi-\ncally smooth flat planar emitter and a parallel planar extrac-\ntor, both of infinite extent, with the emitter having uniform\nwork function and no voltage-dependent field penetration,\n\u0004L=1 \/xD.\nFor the arguments of logarithms, the standard\nconvention56 is used that enclosing a quantity in curly brack-\nets means \u201cmeasure the quantity in brackets in specified\nunits, and take its numerical value.\u201d To avoid ambiguity, the\narguments of logarithms \u0001and also of current densities and\n\u0004-values\u0002 are always expressed in SI base units. Also, the\nunit \u201cNeper\u201d \u0001Np\u0002 is used to measure the difference in values\nof natural logarithms. \u0001That is, if ln\u0005X \/Y\u0006=1, then ln\u0005X\u0006 is\ngreater than ln\u0005Y\u0006 by 1 Np\u0002.\nNote that attaching the label \u201cPoisson\u201d and the subscript\n\u201cP\u201d to the real emission quantities is a device intended to\n084303-2 Richard G.

In the literature, these real quantities\nare usually denoted by the corresponding main symbols,\nwithout subscripts.\nB. Planar space-charge equation\nTo describe the electrostatic effects of space-charge,\nChild1 \u0001and also Langmuir2\u0002 derived, from Poisson\u2019s equa-\ntion, a basic 1D potential equation. In the rationalized meter-\nkilogram-second equation system, this takes the form\nd2U\/dx2 = \u0001\u0005JP\u0002U\u22121\/2, \u00014\u0002\nwhere U\u0001x\u0002 is the magnitude of the classical potential differ-\nence between point x and the emitter surface at x=0, and \u0005 is\na parameter characteristic of the emitted particle, given by\n\u0005 = \u00030\n\u22121\u0001m\/2ne\u00021\/2. \u00015\u0002\nAs noted earlier, these equations apply to particles with any\ncharge, positive or negative, but all must have the same\ncharge. Typical values are \u0005\u00071.904\u0006105 A V3\/2 for an\nelectron and \u0005\u00076.789\u0006107 A V3\/2 for a Ga+ ion.\nFrom Eq. \u00014\u0002, a planar FEVSC equation has been de-\nrived, in various different forms, on many occasions. For\ncompleteness here, we outline a derivation leading to the\nBarbour et al.9 form. On multiplying Eq. \u00014\u0002 by 2dU \/dx, it\nmay be integrated directly to give\n\u0001dU\/dx\u00022 = 4\u0001\u0005JP\u0002U1\/2 + constant. \u00016\u0002\nAt x=0, U=0, and dU \/dx=FP, so Eq. \u00016\u0002 becomes\ndx = \u00034\u0005JPU1\/2 + FP\n2 \u0004\u22121\/2dU . \u00017\u0002\nThis can be integrated by substituting w= \u0001FP\n2 +4\u0005JPU1\/2\u0002,\nwhich leads to\nx + constant = \u00011\/6\u00052JP\n2 \u0002\u00014\u0005JPU1\/2 + FP\n2 \u00021\/2\u00012\u0005JPU1\/2\n\u2212 FP\n2 \u0002 . \u00018\u0002\nU=0 when x=0, so the constant is \u2212FP\n3 \/6\u00052JP\n2\n. Further,\nU=V when x=xD, so we get the result in the Barbour et al.9\nform \u0001their k is our \u0005\u0002,\n6\u00052JP\n2 xD \u2212 FP\n3\n= \u00014\u0005JPV1\/2 + FP\n2 \u00021\/2\u00012\u0005JPV1\/2 \u2212 FP\n2 \u0002 . \u00019\u0002\nAs noted earlier, the derivation of Eq. \u00014\u0002 assumes that\nparticles are emitted normal to the emitting surface with ef-\nfectively zero kinetic energy.1,2 In FEVSC, the surface field\nFP has to be relatively high for emission to occur, whatever\nform of charged-particle emission is concerned, so the par-\nticle is always removed from the surface quickly. Hence, the\ndetails of the distribution of initial kinetic energies are ex-\npected to have little influence on space-charge effects. This\ncontrasts with the situation for thermally emitted vacuum\nspace charge, where the surface field is close to zero, and the\ndistribution of initial kinetic energy is important in detailed\ntheory.3 Wheeler\u2019s work15 confirmed that the initial kinetic-\nenergy distribution is not important in FEVSC theory, except\npossibly for low-work-function materials at very high emis-\nsion currents.\nC. Derivation of a dimensionless equation\nA simpler form, using only dimensionless parameters,\ncan be obtained from Eq. \u00019\u0002. Divide both sides by FP\n3\n, and\nuse xD=V \/FL= \u0001V \/FP\u0002\u0001FP \/FL\u0002=\u0002V \/FP to give\n6\u0002\u00052VJP\n2 \/FP\n4\n\u2212 1 = \u00014\u0005V1\/2JP\/FP\n2 + 1\u00021\/2\u00012\u0005V1\/2JP\/FP\n2\n\u2212 1\u0002 . \u000110\u0002\nOn defining\n\u0001\b \u0005V1\/2JP\/FP\n2\n, \u000111\u0002\nwe obtain\n\u00016\u0002\u00012 \u2212 1\u0002 = \u00014\u0001 + 1\u00021\/2\u00012\u0001 \u2212 1\u0002 . \u000112\u0002\nSquaring and simplifying yields\n9\u00012\u00022 \u2212 3\u0002 \u2212 4\u0001 + 3 = 0. \u000113\u0002\nThis equation, called here the dimensionless planar FE-\nVSC equation, has not been previously reported in reviewed\nliterature. It relates the field reduction factor \u0002 to a dimen-\nsionless parameter \u0001 that quantifies the space-charge\nstrength. Ivey\u2019s parameter8 u is related to \u0001 by u=1 \/4\u0001.\nThe factor JP \/Fp\n2 in \u0001 makes it easy to use FN-type equa-\ntions to calculate \u0001 for electrons emitted by CFE. The biqua-\ndratic form of Eqs. \u000114a\u0002 and \u000114b\u0002 makes it simple to obtain\nanalytical solutions for either \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002 or \u0001\u0001\u0002\u0002, though often \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002\nis of more interest.\nD. General solutions\nClearly the general solution for \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002 can be written as\n\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002 = \u00011\/6\u00012\u0002\u00011\u0007 \t S\u0002, where \u000114a\u0002\nS \b 1 + 4\u00012\u00014\u0001 \u2212 3\u0002 . \u000114b\u0002\nFormula \u000114a\u0002 has a mathematical branch point at \u0001= 12 , at\nwhich S=0 and \u0002= 23 . For \u0001\b\n1\n2 the negative sign must be\ntaken in Eq. \u000114a\u0002, for \u0001\t 12 the positive sign. However, \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002\nis a smoothly varying \u0001monotonically decreasing\u0002 function\nover the whole range of \u0001, as shown in Fig. 1.\nSimilarly, the general solution for \u0001\u0001\u0002\u0002 is\n\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0002 = \u00011\/9\u00022\u0002\u00052\u0007 \t \u00034 \u2013 27\u00022\u00011 \u2212 \u0002\u0002\u0004\u0006 , \u000115\u0002\nwhere for \u0002\b 23 the negative sign is taken, and for \u0002\t\n2\n3 the\npositive sign is taken.\nFIG. 1.

MATHEMATICAL SPACE-CHARGE REGIMES\nAlthough Eqs. \u000114a\u0002 and \u000114b\u0002 can always be used to\ngenerate \u0002-values from \u0001-values, it is instructive to identify\n\u201cmathematical space-charge regimes\u201d where simpler ap-\nproximations apply. In terms of increasing \u0001-values \u0001decreas-\ning \u0002-values\u0002 these are as below. For the limiting regimes it\nis easier to work directly from Eq. \u000113\u0002, rather than by ap-\nproximating Eqs. \u000114a\u0002 and \u000114b\u0002.\nA. Negligible-space-charge regime\nWhen JP \u0001and hence \u0001\u0002 is very small, the terms in \u0001 may\nbe neglected in Eq. \u000113\u0002, and the solution is \u0002\n1. That is,\nFP\nFL=\u0004LV, there is negligible surface field reduction due\nto FEVSC, and the emission current density JP, as a function\nof applied voltage V, has the dependence expected from the\nemission equation and system geometry.\nB. Small-space-charge regime\nWhen \u0001 is small but no longer negligible, the term in \u00012\nin Eq. \u000113\u0002 can be neglected, giving\n\u0002\n 1 \u2212 43\u0001 = 1 \u2212\n4\n3\u0005V\n1\/2JP\/Fp\n2\n. \u000116\u0002\nThis formula was first obtained by Stern et al.,5 and was used\nin their criterion for the absence of significant space-charge\neffects in CFE. If \u0001 is sufficiently small, then Eq. \u000116\u0002 can\nalso be put in the form \u0001in effect\u0002 used by Mair:20\n\u00022 \n 1 \u2212 83\u0001 = 1 \u2212\n8\n3\u0005V\n1\/2JP\/Fp\n2\n. \u000117\u0002\nIn the part of the range between \u0001=0 and \u0001= 12 where\n\u00011\u2212S\u0002 is sufficiently small, a binomial expansion of \u00031+ \u0001S\n\u22121\u0002\u0004 may be used to approximate \tS in Eq. \u000113\u0002 as\n\u00031+ 12 \u0001S\u22121\u0002\u2212\n1\n8 \u0001S\u22121\u0002\n2\u0004. This yields an approximation\nequivalent to Eq. \u000113\u0002 in Stern et al.,5 namely,\n\u0002\n 1 \u2212 43\u0001 + 3\u0001\n2\n\u2212 8\u00013. \u000118\u0002\nC. Branch-point neighborhood\nAt the branch point \u0001= 12 , S has a minimum of value\nzero, and \u0002=1 \/ \u00016\u00012\u0002= 23 . Above \u0001=\n1\n2 , S becomes larger rap-\nidly; below \u0001= 12 , S increases relatively slowly to a math-\nematical maximum of 1 at \u0001=0. Near the branch point, there\nis a narrow range where the best linear approximation is\n\u0002\n \u0001 23\u0002\u00031 + \u0001\u2212 4\u0007 2 \t 3\u0002\u0001\u0001 \u2212 12\u0002\u0004 . \u000119\u0002\nFor \u0001\t 12 the positive sign is taken, for \u0001\b\n1\n2 the negative\nsign. However, this approximation seems to be of limited\npractical use, and it may be better to use the general formula.\nOn either side of this narrow branch-point neighborhood\nthere are intermediate regimes where no useful simple ap-\nproximation exists and the general solution should be used.\nD. Child\u2019s law regime\nWhen JP is large, the terms in \u0001 may be assumed to\ndominate in Eq. \u000112\u0002, and the outcome is a dimensionless\nform of Child\u2019s law,1,57 namely,\n\u0002\n 23\u0001\n\u22121\/2\n. \u000120\u0002\nIf Eqs. \u00011\u0002, \u00012\u0002, and \u000111\u0002 are used to replace \u0002 and \u0001, we\nobtain the more familiar forms of Child\u2019s law, which gives\nthe fully space-charge-limited current density JC as\nJC = \u0001 49\u0002\u0005\u22121V3\/2\/xD2 = \u0001 49\u0002\u0005\u22121\u0004L2V3\/2 = \u0001 49\u0002\u0005\u22121\u0004L1\/2FL3\/2.\n\u000121\u0002\nIn Eq. \u000114b\u0002, when \u0001 is large we have S\u000b16\u00013, so both\nS and +\tS become large in comparison with unity. In such\ncircumstances, Eq. \u000114a\u0002 reduces to\n\u0002\n 23\u0001\n\u22121\/2\u00031 \u2013 3\/\u00014\u0001\u0002\u00041\/2. \u000122\u0002\nClearly, Eq. \u000122\u0002 has the form of the Child\u2019s law result, mul-\ntiplied by a correction factor that gets closer to unity as \u0001\ngets larger.\nE. Partial space-charge equations\nFrom the definitions of \u0002 and \u0001, it can be shown that\n9\u00022\u0001\/4 = JP\/JC \b j , \u000123\u0002\nwhere j is defined by Eq. \u000123\u0002. Multiplying both sides of Eq.\n\u000115\u0002 by \u00019\u00022 \/4\u0002 yields\nJP\/JC = \u0001 12\u0002\u00051\u0007 \t \u00031 \u2212 \u0001 274 \u0002\u00022\u00011 \u2212 \u0002\u0002\u0004\u0006 . \u000124\u0002\nThis is the dimensionless fomula derived by Ivey8 as his Eq.\n\u000115\u0002, and plotted as his Fig. 1.\nSimilarly, squaring Eqs. \u000114a\u0002 and \u000114b\u0002 and then multi-\nplying by 9\u0001 \/4 yields\nJP\/JC = \u00011\/16\u00013\u0002\u00011 + S\u0007 2 \t S\u0002 , \u000125\u0002\nwhere S is given by Eq. \u000114b\u0002, and the negative sign is taken\nif \u0001\b 12 , the positive sign if \u0001\t\n1\n2 . This equation has not\npreviously been reported. Figure 1 here shows JP \/JC as a\nfunction of \u0001, for 0\n\u0001\n6.\nUsing Eq. \u000123\u0002 to substitute \u0001= \u0001 49 \u0002j\u0002\u22122 into Eq. \u000113\u0002\nyields\nj2 \u2212 j + \u000127\/16\u0002\u00022\u00011 \u2212 \u0002\u0002 = 0. \u000126\u0002\nThis is the dimensionless equation derived by Gon\u00e7ales et\nal.33 Eqs. \u000123\u0002\u2013\u000126\u0002 are most useful in so-called \u201cpartial\nspace-charge conditions.\u201d8\nF. Discussion\nThis analysis shows that all the usual simple 1D planar\nFEVSC formulas, and some additional ones, can be deduced\nfrom the dimensionless Eq. \u000113\u0002, its exact analytical solu-\ntions Eqs. \u000114a\u0002, \u000114b\u0002, and \u000115\u0002, and the relation \u000123\u0002 that\nlinks the three dimensionless quantities \u0001, \u0002, and j. These\nequations serve to integrate 1D planar FEVSC theory.\nEquation \u000113\u0002 has two terms that dominate at low\n\u0001-values and a different two that dominate at high \u0001-values.\nThis mathematical structure, also present in Eq. \u000127\u0002 below,\nensures that, physically, the system moves smoothly from the\nlow-\u0001 situation, where the JP\u0001V\u0002 characteristic is given by a\nformula specific to the form of emission being discussed, to\nthe high-\u0001 situation, where the JP\u0001V\u0002 characteristic obeys\nChild\u2019s law, irrespective of emission mechanism.\n084303-4 Richard G. Forbes J. Appl. Phys. 104, 084303 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nNote that the JP\u0001FP\u0002 relation is, at all applied voltages,\nthat for the emission mechanism being discussed; FEVSC\neffects cause no breakdown in this JP\u0001FP\u0002 relationship. What\nhappens is that, as \u0001 increases, the Poisson conversion factor\n\u0004P=FP \/V changes from being nearly constant to being a\nfunction of applied voltage and surface field. The observed\ni\u0001V\u0002 relationship gives the impression of breakdown in the\nJP\u0001FP\u0002 relationship only if it is not realized that \u0004P is no\nlonger constant.\nIV. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JP AND V\nAs just shown, formulas \u000114a\u0002 and \u000114b\u0002 are useful for\ncore theoretical purposes, in particular for identifying FE-\nVSC regimes. In the high-FEVSC limit, they provide the\nChild\u2019s law prediction for JP\u0001V\u0002. However, to predict JP\u0001V\u0002\nin other circumstances, a specific emission equation must be\nprovided for JP\u0001FP\u0002. To prepare, we reinsert Eqs. \u00011\u0002, \u00012\u0002,\nand \u000111\u0002 into Eq. \u000113\u0002, and multiply through by V\u22121\/2 to ob-\ntain\nGc\u0001V\u0002 \b \u0001c3C + c3L\u0002V\u22123\/2 + c1LV\u22121\/2 + c0C = 0, \u000127\u0002\nwhere the coefficients are given by\nc3C=9\u0001\u0005\u0004L\n\u22121FP\u00022\u0001JP \/FP\n2 \u00022, c3L=\u22123\u0004L\n\u22121FP, c1L=3, and\nc0C=\u22124\u0005\u0001JP \/Fp\n2\u0002. This is a cubic equation in the variable\nV\u22121\/2; the terms using coefficients c1L and c3L dominate in the\nlow-\u0001 situation, the terms using coefficients c0C and c3C\ndominate in the high-\u0001 \u0001Child\u2019s law\u0002 situation.\nFurther substitutions a1=c1L \/ \u0001c3C+c3L\u0002 and\na0=c0C \/ \u0001c3C+c3L\u0002 yield\nG\u0001V\u0002 \b V\u22123\/2 + a1V\u22121\/2 + a0 = 0. \u000128\u0002\nThis is a standard mathematical form for which an analytical\nsolution exists \u0001see Appendix 1\u0002.\nA value is now needed for \u0004L, and the relevant emission\nequation JP\u0001FP\u0002 must be introduced. Barbour et al.9 took \u0004L\nto be the value given by Eq. \u00012\u0002 in the real experimental\nsituation. This \u0004L can in principle be calculated from the\nsystem geometry, but for CFE, it is better obtained empiri-\ncally from the slope of the linear middle region of a FN plot\nof type \u0003ln\u0005i \/V2\u0006 versus 1 \/V\u0004.\nA convenient procedure9 is then to choose a suitable\nvalue of FP, calculate corresponding values of JP, a0, and a1,\nand solve Eq. \u000128\u0002 to obtain the corresponding value of V. In\nthe past, analytical solutions have been thought awkward, so\ncomputational methods have been used. If the dependence of\nnotional emission area A on voltage is known, or if A is\ntaken to have a known constant value, then the emission\ncurrent i can be obtained from i=AJP. This yields a consis-\ntent set of values \u0001FP ,JP ,V , i\u0002. From many such sets, data for\na JP\u0001V\u0002 or i\u0001V\u0002 characteristic is obtained. This approach was\nused by Barbour et al.,9 specifically for CFE. However, the\nequations here apply to any charged-particle surface emis-\nsion process, once the relevant emission equation JP\u0001FP\u0002 is\nprovided.\nV. ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATIONS\nTo illustrate formula use, we examine some simple ap-\nplications. As earlier, JP denotes the actual emission current\ndensity, JL the corresponding Laplace current density, and JC\nthe corresponding Child\u2019s law current density. The predic-\ntions of JL and JC are made for the same values of \u0004L, V, and\nFL as applied to the calculation of JP \u0001i.e., they are made for\nthe same system geometry and applied voltage\u0002.\nA. Field reduction at the LMIS apex\nFor the gallium LMIS, the operating point on the i\u0001V\u0002\ncharacteristic is controlled by FEVSC effects.20 Near emis-\nsion onset, the LMIS apex radius ra is typically about 1.5\nnm, and the emission current typically about 2 \u000bA.36 Taking\nemission to come from an area \fra\n2\u0001\n7.1 nm2\u0002, we estimate\ncurrent density as JP\n2.8\u00061011 A \/m2.\nPlanar FEVSC theory does not strictly apply to such a\nsmall sharply curved object, but can be used to estimate \u0001\nand \u0002. For Ga+ ions, \u0005\u00076.789\u0006107 A V3\/2. The LMIS\nemission mechanism is field evaporation, which for Ga oc-\ncurs at FP\n15 V \/nm.36 A typical extracting voltage is\nV=3000 V. From Eq. \u000111\u0002, these numbers yield \u0001\n4.7,\nS\n1370, and \u0002\n0.29. This strongly supports the idea that\nsubstantial field reduction occurs at a LMIS apex.\nB. Field-stress reduction at the LMIS apex\nA surface field F causes an outward electrostatic \u0001\u201cMax-\nwell\u201d\u0002 stress M on the surface, given by M = 12\u00030F2. For a\ngiven system geometry and applied voltage, the Maxwell\nstress in the presence of space charge \u0001MP\u0002 is less than it\nwould have been \u0001ML\u0002 in the absence of space charge, by an\namount \rM given by\n\rM = ML \u2212 MP = MP\u0001\u0002\u22122 \u2212 1\u0002 . \u000129\u0002\nIf a parameter g\u0001\u0001\u0002 is defined by\ng\u0001\u0001\u0002 \b \u0001\u0002\u22122 \u2212 1\u0002\/\u0001 , \u000130\u0002\nso \rM =g\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001MP, then Eqs. \u000116\u0002, \u000120\u0002, and \u000130\u0002 show that, in\nthe limiting cases where \u0001 has low and high values, we ob-\ntain g=8 \/3 and 9\/4, respectively.\nThe quantities \rM and g\u0001\u0001\u0002 are important when deriving\nMair\u2019s equation20,36 for the LMIS i\u0001V\u0002 characteristic. Since\nwe now have a relationship \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002 valid for the whole range of\n\u0001, Eq. \u000128\u0002 can be used to plot g\u0001\u0001\u0002 up to \u0001-values beyond\nthose likely to be found in practice. The result is Fig. 2. This\nconfirms that the variation is smooth and small, with no hid-\nden difficulties.\nThe results in Secs. V A and V B have been used in a\nrecent review of LMIS theory.36\nFIG. 2. To show how the factor g\u0001\u0001\u0002 varies with \u0001.\n084303-5 Richard G. Forbes J. Appl.

Effect of FEVSC on Fowler\u2013Nordheim plot shape\nWe now illustrate electron emission effects, starting with\nthe shape of FN plots.5,47 FEVSC effects on CFE have often\nbeen discussed \u0001see earlier citations\u0002, but often, following\nBarbour et al., predictions are presented as semilogarithmic\nplots, of type \u0003ln\u0005J\u0006 versus 1 \/FL\u0004 or equivalent. The pre-\ndicted behavior of FN plots in strong space-charge condi-\ntions has not been fully described.\nFor metals, CFE is described in principle by the so-\ncalled physical \u0001or \u201cphysically complete\u201d\u0002 FN-type\nequation,58 written here in the form used in Eq. \u000118\u0002 of Ref.\n58, namely,\nJP = JFN = \u000eZa\u000f\u22121Fp\n2PF exp\u0001\u2212 \u0010Fb\u000f3\/2\/FP\u0002 . \u000131\u0002\nHere \u000f is the local work function of the emitting surface,\na\u0001\u00071.541 434\u000610\u22126 A eV V\u22122\u0002 and b\u0001\u00076.830 890\neV\u22123\/2 V nm\u22121\u0002 are the first and second FN constants as usu-\nally defined,47 \u0010F is a physical correction factor associated\nwith the barrier-shape model used,58 PF is a tunnelling\nprefactor,59 and \u000eZ is a physical correction factor associated\nwith electron supply58 to the barrier. To make calculations\npracticable, we used the so-called standard FN-type\nequation46,47 in which the correction factors in Eq. \u000131\u0002 have\nbeen approximated in the following way: PF\u21921, \u0010F\u2192vF,\nand \u000eZ\u2192\u0011F\u22122, where vF and \u0011F are the relevant values of\nmathematical functions \u0001the \u201cSchottky\u2013Nordheim barrier\nfunctions\u201d\u0002 well known46,47 in CFE theory. These replace-\nments yield the equation\nJP \n \u0011F\n\u22122a\u000f\u22121Fp\n2 exp\u0003\u2212 vFb\u000f3\/2\/FP\u0004 . \u000132\u0002\nThe analytical solution of Eq. \u000128\u0002 was then implemented on\na spreadsheet \u0001see Appendix 1\u0002, using Eq. \u000132\u0002. It is thought\nthat analytical solutions for Eq. \u000128\u0002 have not previously\nbeen used in CFE literature; Appendix 1 notes some math-\nematical details.\nFigure 3 shows the resulting FN plot, for \u000f=4.5 eV,\nand the Barbour et al.9 value of \u0004L=4\u0006105 m\u22121. Curve L is\nfrom the emission equation \u0003Eq. \u000132\u0002\u0004 in the absence of space\ncharge, curve C is from Child\u2019s law \u0003Eq. \u000121\u0002\u0004, and curve P\n\u0001marked with dots\u0002 is from Eq. \u000128\u0002. Following Barbour et\nal.,9 these plots are made against 1 \/FL\u0003\b1 \/\u0004LV\u0004, rather than\nagainst 1 \/V, because \u0001for a given \u000f-value\u0002 curve L is then\nthe same for all \u0004L values. Clearly, as FL increases \u00011 \/FL\ndecreases\u0002, curve P initially follows curve L, then separates\nfrom it and \u201cturns over completely\u201d to join curve C.\nCurve P is evaluated only up to the field value FP=Fb\nwhere the top of tunneling barrier goes below the Fermi\nlevel, and is terminated at the value of FL corresponding to\nFP=Fb. Above FP=Fb the emission regime becomes field-\ninduced ballistic emission; the theory of this emission regime\nis not well developed, although there is a recent\nexploration.60\nIn fact, Eq. \u000132\u0002 ceases to be physically valid at a value\nof FP slightly lower than Fb; an alternative relationship takes\nover, and extends beyond Fb, producing a \u201chigh-field inter-\nmediate emission regime.\u201d Causes of breakdown of Eq. \u000132\u0002,\nas FP approaches Fb, are failure of the image potential en-\nergy to correctly represent correlation-and-exchange\neffects,48,49,61,62 field-induced changes in surface wave func-\ntions that lead to a change in work function,62 breakdown,\nwhen the barrier height is small, of the simple Jefferies\u2013\nWentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin formula used in the derivation\nof Eq. \u000132\u0002,59,63 and\/or \u0001close to FP=Fb\u0002 increasing incidence\nof thermally activated electron escape over the top of the\nbarrier. As the references indicate, some of these effects have\nbeen investigated individually; but no integrated emission\ntheory exists for this high-field intermediate regime.\nIn practice, these theoretical weaknesses in emission\ntheory cause no qualitative difficulty for curve P in Fig. 3,\nbecause near FP=Fb a corrected curve P would \u0001almost cer-\ntainly\u0002 closely resemble curve C. A theoretically correct\ncurve P would certainly turn over completely as V and FL\nincrease, but its shape in the turn-over region would be\nslightly different.\nCurve L is terminated at FL=Fb. For visual convenience,\ncurve C is arbitrarily terminated at 1 \/FL=10\u22125 nm \/V. Ob-\nviously, this corresponds to FL values enormously above\nthose accessible experimentally. Note that both the Poisson\nand Laplace curves do in principle extend to higher field\nvalues than Fb; they are terminated in the figures because, as\nyet, we have no satisfactory mathematical emission theory\nfor this field range.\nSome past FEVSC analyses have used, instead of Eq.\n\u000132\u0002, the so-called \u201celementary FN-type equation.\u201d This is\nFIG. 3. Plots, in FN coordinates, showing how the Laplace \u0001L\u0002, Poisson \u0001P\u0002,\nand Child\u2019s law \u0001C\u0002 current densities JL, JP, and JC vary with the Laplace\nfield FL, for the parameter values \u000f=4.5 eV and \u0004L=4\u0006105m\u22121. This \u0004L\nvalue corresponds to a tungsten emitter of moderate to large apex radius, in\na conventional field electron microscope configuration. Curve P is marked\nwith dots and is terminated at the point where the Poisson field FP becomes\nequal to the value Fb at which the top of the tunneling barrier goes below the\nemitter Fermi level. The numbers 0.90, 0.95, and 0.98 are \u0002-values corre-\nsponding to different possible criteria for the onset of FEVSC effects, and\nlabel points on the Poisson curve where \u0002 approximately has these values.\n084303-6 Richard G.

In fact, the effect\ncould have been predicted from Fig. 9 in Ref. 27, and a\nsimilar trend is evident in Fig. 2 of Ref. 25, although the\neffect is more obvious in the present calculations. Complete\nturn over at sufficiently high voltage can also be predicted by\na simple theoretical argument. In the Child\u2019s law regime, Eq.\n\u000121\u0002 shows that JC\u000bV3\/2, hence JC\u000bFL\n3\/2\n. It follows that\n\u0001JC \/FL\n2\u0002\u000b\u00011 \/FL\u00021\/2, so one expects curve C to have the\nshape shown, and curve P to approximate this shape at low\nvalues of 1 \/FL.\nIn FN coordinates of type \u0003ln\u0005J \/FL\n2\u0006 versus 1 \/FL\u0004,\nChild\u2019s law has the form\nln\u0005JC\/FL\n2\u0006 = ln\u0005\u0001 49\u0002\u0005\u22121\u0004L1\/2\u0006 + \u0001 12\u0002ln\u00051\/FL\u0006 . \u000133\u0002\nCurves for different \u0004L-values are parallel vertically, so the\nlimiting form of curve P at low values of 1 \/FL depends on\n\u0004L. For example, individual emitters in a Spindt array have\n\u0004L-values typically around 107\u2212108 m\u22121 \u0001compare the Bar-\nbour et al.9 value of 4\u0006105 m\u22121\u0002. So, for a Spindt emitter\nthe maximum will tend to occur at values of ln\u0005JP \/FL\n2\u0006 and\nJP higher than those for a moderate-radius tungsten emitter.\nFigure 4 illustrates this effect, for the relatively high value\n\u0004L=8\u0006107 m\u22121.\nThus, for \u000f=4.5 eV and \u0004L=4\u0006105 m\u22121, the maxi-\nmum in curve P occurs at values FP\n9.2 V \/nm,\nJP\n3.0\u00061012 A \/m2. However, for \u000f=4.5 eV and\n\u0004L=8\u0006107 m\u22121, the maximum is predicted to occur at field\nFP greater than Fb \u0003\t14.0 V \/nm\u0004; if standard theory were\nquantitatively valid at this point \u0001which it is not\u0002, then we\nwould predict that JP\t5.5\u00061013 A \/m2.\nAs noted earlier, the emission current is i=AJP, where A\nis the notional emission area. Obviously, with raw experi-\nmental data, one plots ln\u0005i \/V2\u0006 against 1 \/V. If A is taken as\nconstant, such plots are predicted to have the same general\nshape as curve P. However, as far as the author is aware,\nexperimental FN plots exhibiting complete turn over have\nnever been reported. Probably, the main reason has usually\nbeen that the maximum in curve P occurs at voltages higher\nthan those that could be safely applied in the experiments in\nquestion. \u0001With real field emitters, the current densities may\noften not be able to get near the Child\u2019s law situation, even\nwith pulsed operation, because heating would be too great\nand destroy the emitter.\u0002 This was certainly the case with the\nBarbour et al.9 experiments and the similar experiments by\nDyke and Trolan,64 where the \u0004L-values are known. Other\npossible reasons for nonobservation of turn over are that data\nhave not been plotted in the correct form to show the effect,\nor that the emission area A depends on voltage, with a power\nlaw greater than 0.5 \u0001voltage dependence in A was suggested\nlong ago65\u0002.\nGiven that new sharper types of emitter have been intro-\nduced since serious experiments were last performed on FE-\nVSC theory, it might be interesting to measure pulsed high-\nvoltage i\u0001V\u0002 characteristics for emitters able to withstand\nhigh current densities for short times \u0001if experimental prob-\nlems can be overcome66,67\u0002. A difficulty is that a small-radius\nemitter is better able to dissipate heating effects, but exhibits\nFEVSC effects only at higher JP-values: At present, the\ntrade-off between these effects is not clear. A second diffi-\nculty is that emitter heating will by itself change the emis-\nsion current density, and this change will need to be taken\ninto account if there is a significant rise in apex temperature.\nD. Criterion for onset of space-charge effects\nThe current density at which FEVSC effects cause ob-\nservable deviation from FN plots or Barbour et al.9 type plots\nis of interest. A possible criterion is \u0002=0.90. In Fig. 3, this\noccurs when the horizontal separation of curves L and P is\nroughly 10% of the X-axis value for curve L. \u0001Points corre-\nsponding approximately to \u0002=0.90, 0.95, and 0.98 are\nmarked.\u0002\nEquation \u000115\u0002 allows an approximate treatment. For \u0002\n=0.90 we obtain \u0001=\u0005V1\/2JP \/FP\n2\n=0.089 65. With \u0005=1.9043\n\u0006105 A V3\/2, and for V=20 kV \u0001typical of the Barbour et\nal.9 experiments\u0002, we obtain JP \/FP\n2 \u000b3.3\u000610\u22129 A V\u22122. The\nformula FP=\u0002\u0004LV yields FP\u000b7.2 V \/nm and then JP\u000b1.7\n\u00061011 A \/m2.\nFor comparison, the exact spreadsheet-based planar-\ngeometry calculation, with \u000f=4.5 eV and \u0004=4\u0006105 m\u22121,\nyields FP\n6.7 V \/nm, JP\n1.6\u00061011 A \/m2, ln\u0005JP \/FL\n2\u0006\n\n\u221219.7, and V\n18 700 V. It also finds the vertical difference\nbetween curves L and P at this point as about 1.1 Np.\nFor a small-radius emitter such as a Spindt emitter, the\nillustrative values \u000f=4.5 eV, \u0004L=8\u0006107 m\u22121, and V\n=100 V lead to the approximate results: FP\u000b7.2 V \/nm and\nFIG. 4. Enlarged version of the turn-over region in Fig. 3, for \u0004L values \u00011\u0002\n4\u0006105 m\u22121 and \u00012\u0002 8\u0006107 m\u22121. The latter value corresponds to a sharp\nemitter, as might be used in a Spindt array. The Laplace and Poisson curves\nare terminated when the top of the relevant tunneling barrier goes below the\nemitter Fermi level. For the high-\u0004L Poisson curve this occurs before turn\nover. Theoretically, the Poisson curves continue into the ballistic emission\nregime and eventually merge with the relevant Child\u2019s law curve, but this\npart of the Poisson curve may not normally be experimentally accessible.\nFigure 4 suggests that, for sharp emitters, FEVSC effects become significant\nat higher current densities than for blunter emitters, if other things are equal.\n084303-7 Richard G.

The exact planar geometry calcula-\ntion yields FP\n9.4 V \/nm, JP\n3.7\u00061012 A \/m2,\nln\u0005JP \/FL\n2\u0006\n\u221217.2, and V\n131.2 V, with the vertical differ-\nence between curves A and B equal to 0.8 Np.\nFigure 4 compares these cases, and suggests that FEVSC\neffects set in at significantly higher current densities for\nemitters with high \u0004L values. Physically, this can be deduced\nfrom the definition of FEVSC strength, \u0001=\u0005V1\/2JP \/FP\n2\n=\u0005\u0001FL\n1\/2 \/FP\n2 \u0002\u0001\u0004L\n\u22121\/2JP\u0002. If we disregard changes in field in\ncomparison with changes in JP, then a given value of \u0001 is\nachieved at a given value of \u0001\u0004L\n\u22121\/2JP\u0002. This implies that \u0001in a\nfirst approximation\u0002 the JP value for onset of FEVSC effects\nis proportional to \u0004L\n1\/2\n. Sharp emitters have high \u0004L values,\nso \u0001to the extent that 1D planar theory applies\u0002 one expects\nFEVSC effects to become significant for sharp emitters at\nhigher JP values than for blunt emitters.\nNumerically, it seems clear that estimates made using the\nspreadsheet program are more reliable than those made using\nsimple arguments based on Eq. \u000115\u0002. This is probably be-\ncause the latter approach involves estimating the onset volt-\nage for FEVSC effects.\nE. Criterion for approach to the Child\u2019s law regime\nA simple criterion for approach to the full Child\u2019s law\nregime puts JP \/JC equal to some set fraction. For illustration,\nwe use JP \/JC=0.80 here. This corresponds to a separation\nbetween curves C and P of about 0.22 Np. From Eqs. \u000124\u0002\nand \u000125\u0002 we find that this occurs for \u0002=0.3963 and \u0001\n=2.264.\nFor \u000f=4.5 eV and \u0004L=5\u0006104 m\u22121, spreadsheet calcu-\nlations show that this criterion corresponds to FP\n=9.70 V \/nm, FL=24.5 V \/nm, V=61 kV, JP=4.5\n\u00061012 A \/m2, and ln\u0005JP \/FL\n2\u0006=\u221218.7.\nFor \u000f=4.5 eV and \u0004L=8\u0006107 m\u22121, spreadsheet calcu-\nlations show that this criterion corresponds to a surface field\nFP significantly greater than Fb \u0001i.e., FP significantly greater\nthan 14.0 V\/nm, FL significantly greater than 35 V\/nm, and\nJP significantly greater than 5.5\u00061013 A \/m2\u0002. So, according\nto planar FEVSC theory, an emitter with \u000f=4.5 eV and\n\u0004L=8\u0006107 m\u22121 that is emitting in the CFE emission regime\ncan never be really close to the Child\u2019s law space-charge\nregime. At the field Fb we have \u0002\n0.55 and JP \/JC\n0.64.\nObviously, the numerical results obtained here and in\nSec. V E depend on the precise criteria chosen. As yet, there\nis no consensus on what criteria should be used. Also, of\ncourse, the theory here is a theory of what happens if the\nemitter neither heats significantly nor self-destructs. Heating\nissues \u0001especially for sharp emitters\u0002 are considered in\nFursey\u2019s66 book, and also motivate Jensen\u2019s63 work on the\ndevelopment of general equations covering thermal, field,\nand photoemission.\nVI. A MODIFIED PLANAR-GEOMETRY MODEL\nIn the plane-parallel geometry used above, the emitter\nsurface sees the field due to a FEVSC \u201ccone\u201d of solid angle\n2\f. With a real field emitter, the local current density falls\noff with distance from the surface, and the surface sees the\nfield due to a FEVSC cone of solid angle much less than 2\f.\nSo, for given surface emission current density, the FEVSC-\ninduced reduction in surface field is expected to be less for\nthe nonplanar geometry.\nIn formulas above, the strength of FEVSC effects could\nbe changed by replacing \u0001 by\n\u0001c = \u0012\u0001 = \u0012\u0005V1\/2JFP\n\u22122\n, \u000134\u0002\nwhere \u0012 is a \u201cstrength correction factor.\u201d Thus, for example,\nfor the small-space-charge regime we would obtain\n\u0002 = 1 \u2212 \u00014\/3\u0002\u0012\u0001 . \u000135\u0002\nIf the correct \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002 dependence were known at the emitter\napex for some specific system geometry, then for any specific\n\u0002-value used as a criterion, one could use \u0012 as a scaling\nparameter to make Eq. \u000135\u0002 predict the correct answer. Ap-\npropriate values of \u0012 are not currently known, and it is not\nknown how good this \u201cscaling\u201d would be for other \u0001-values.\nIt would seem useful to explore these issues. The means to\ndo this seems available since FEVSC effects are already em-\nbedded in some academic and commercial programs,37\u201340\nbased on Monte Carlo methods, that are used to analyze\nelectron and ion optical effects in the design of focused-\nbeam systems.\nMore generally, Mair\u2019s equation,20,36 for the LMIS i\u0001V\u0002\ncharacteristic, is quantitatively successful in predicting\ndi \/dV, even though its derivation involves applying a planar-\ngeometry FEVSC formula to an emitting apex of radius\nabout 1.5 nm. Thus, there seems some hope that useful ap-\nproximate formulas for nonplanar geometries might be de-\nvised. I urge that relevant Monte Carlo simulations involving\nrealistic emitter geometries be carried out.\nVII. RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS\nElectron mass increases at relativistic speeds. For given\napplied voltage, electrons take slightly longer to leave the\nvacuum space than nonrelativistic FEVSC theory would pre-\ndict; so the FEVSC-induced reduction in emitter field is\nslightly greater. For CFE from metals, the theory of this ef-\nfect is well explained in a paper by Wheeler.16\nThe energy-equivalent Ee of the electron rest mass \u0001Ee\n=mec0\n2\n, where c0 is the velocity of light\u0002 is about 250 keV. At\nan energy Ec \/10, i.e., about 25 keV, the increase in mass is\nabout 10%. From Eqs. \u00015\u0002 and \u000111\u0002, the equivalent increases\nin \u0005 and \u0001 are about 5%. However, the actual effect on cal-\nculated values of \u0002 and FP will be less than this, because\nrelativistic mass increase will be significant only when the\nelectron has reached a sufficiently large speed. For working\npurposes, we can take 25 kV as the voltage value above\nwhich relativistic corrections begin to need consideration.\nFor real electron emitters, few applications will use ex-\ntraction voltages as high as 25 kV, so relativistic corrections\nwill often not be relevant. However, in accelerator and other\nhigh-voltage contexts, depending on the precise arrange-\nments of electrodes and voltages, relativistic effects may\nneed thinking about.\nOn the other hand, theoretical predictions of FEVSC ef-\nfects \u0001including those here\u0002 certainly may extend formally\ninto field and voltage ranges where relativistic corrections\n084303-8 Richard G. Forbes J. Appl. Phys. 104, 084303 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nought in principle to be included, if quantitative self-\nconsistency is needed. For example, the values of the\nLaplace field FL corresponding to a voltage of 25 kV are: 10\nV\/nm for \u0004L=4\u0006105 m\u22121 and 2000 V\/nm for \u0004L=8\n\u0006107 m\u22121. Since the real emitter surface field FP must be\nless than FL, it follows that, for the emitters of moderate\napex radius to which the value \u0004L=4\u0006105 m\u22121 applies, the\nformal predictions shown in Fig. 3 do reach into a field range\n\u00011 \/FL\b0.1 nm \/V\u0002 where relativistic corrections are rel-\nevant in principle.\nHowever, relativistic corrections do not significantly af-\nfect the qualititative arguments about curve turn over pre-\nsented here, because they tend to reduce the emission current\nbelow the value predicted by Child\u2019s law, and hence tend to\nenhance the turn-over effect seen in a FN plot.\nRelativistic effects are thought to be unimportant for\nfield ion emission sources because ion masses are much\nhigher than the electron mass.\nVIII. SUMMARY\nThis paper has aimed to put onto a better mathematical\nbasis the classical 1D theory of field-emitted vacuum space\ncharge in planar geometry. Three dimensionless parameters\n\u0001\u0001, \u0002, and j\u0002, and the two simple dimensionless relationships\n\u000113\u0002 and \u000123\u0002 are the core of this revised FEVSC mathemat-\nics. From these, we can derive most existing basic FEVSC\nformulas and some additional ones. A key feature has been\nthe introduction of the concept of space-charge strength \u0001.\nIllustrative applications have been: \u0001a\u0002 formulas \u000114a\u0002\nand \u000114b\u0002 enable the magnitude of field reduction effects to\nbe estimated easily, \u0001b\u0002 formula \u000130\u0002 fills in a missing part of\nliquid metal ion source theory, \u0001c\u0002 the procedure described in\nAppendix 1 enables J-V characteristics to be evaluated ana-\nlytically, \u0001d\u0002 Fig. 3 shows that related FN plots may be\nshaped differently from common expectation, and \u0001e\u0002 Fig. 4\nsuggests that high-\u0004L emitters will be less affected by FE-\nVSC.\nThese results should be seen primarily as contributing to\nbetter basic qualitative understanding of FEVSC effects.\nHowever, they also have quantitative value as limits. This is\nbecause we expect that, for a given space-charge strength,\nthe planar-geometry situation is the \u201cworst case,\u201d in the\nsense that FEVSC effects will be greater in this geometry\nthan in configurations involving curved emitters.\nIf possible, it would be desirable to develop simple FE-\nVSC approximations and formulas that apply adequately to\nmore realistic emitter geometries. These should supplement,\nrather than replace, detailed numerical investigations. It is\nsuggested that the sophisticated Monte Carlo-type programs\nused in electron and ion optical designs could be customized\nto investigate FEVSC effects in realistic system geometries,\nand it is urged that this possibility be explored.\nAPPENDIX: SOLUTION OF CUBIC EQUATION FOR\nJP\u201eV\u2026.\nGeneral analytical procedures for solving cubic equa-\ntions are well known and described in textbooks and on the\nweb.68 A problem with Eq. \u000128\u0002 is to identify unambiguously,\nat any particular voltage, which of the mathematical roots\ncorresponds to the physical solution. This problem is usually\navoided by solving the equation numerically and tracking the\nlowest positive root as V increases.9 This appendix indicates\nhow to deal with it when using analytical solutions. Earlier\nFEVSC literature has not discussed this.\nEquation \u000128\u0002 is a standard form for a cubic equation in\nthe variable z\bV\u22121\/2, and has analytical solutions as\nfollows:68\nR \b \u2212 a0\/2, D \b a1\n3\/27 + a0\n2\/4, \u0001A1\u0002\nS \b \u0001R + \t D\u00021\/3, T \b \u0001R \u2212 \t D\u00021\/3. \u0001A2\u0002\nIn the case where D\b0, and \tD is imaginary, we may\nuse standard procedures to evaluate specific roots for S and T\nin the form\nS \b X + jY, T \b X \u2212 jY , \u0001A3\u0002\nwhere j\b \t\u22121, X, and Y are positive real numbers and S lies\nin the first quadrant of the Argand diagram. In these circum-\nstances, the three roots of Eq. \u000128\u0002 are all real and are given\nby\nV1\n\u22121\/2\n= 2X , \u0001A4\u0002\nV2\n\u22121\/2\n= \u2212 X \u2212 Y \t 3, \u0001A5\u0002\nV3\n\u22121\/2\n= \u2212 X + Y \t 3. \u0001A6\u0002\nThe root V2\n\u22121\/2 is negative and of no physical interest.\nIn the case where D\t0, and \tD is real, there are one\nreal root and two complex roots, with the real root given by\nV4\n\u22121\/2\n= S + T = \u0001R + \t D\u00021\/3 + \u0001R \u2212 \t D\u00021\/3, \u0001A7\u0002\nwhere S is a positive real number and T a negative real\nnumber.\nIt has been straightforward to program the results for V1,\nV3, and V4, and the corresponding values of \u0002, onto a spread-\nsheet developed from one described earlier,69 which evalu-\nates JP\u0001FP ,\u000f\u0002 for the standard FN-type equation. Inspection\nof trends, as the values of FP \u0001and hence V\u0002 increase from\nzero, shows that there are two mathematical branch points\nand an emission regime change point \u0001where the top of the\ntunneling barrier goes below the Fermi level\u0002. At low\nV-values the physical solution is V1. At the lower branch\npoint \u0001which corresponds to the one already identified in Eq.\n\u000115\u0002, at which S=0\u0002, the physical solution changes from V1\nto V3. At the upper branch point, which corresponds to the\npoint where D changes from negatively infinite to positively\ninfinite, the physical solution changes from V3 to V4.\nFor an emitter with \u000f=4.5 eV and \u0004L=4\u0006105 m\u22121, the\nbranch points and the change point occur at fields of 8.105,\n8.491, and 14.063 V\/nm, respectively. The same pattern ap-\nplies for other values of \u000f and \u0004L, but with different field\nvalues.\nOne needs to select the physically appropriate branch for\nany particular FP-value, without inspecting trends. Identify-\ning the upper branch point is easy, as V4\n\u22121\/2 changes from\ncomplex to real at this point. The lower branch point is less\nstraightforward. However, it is found that D\u0001FP\u0002 goes\n084303-9 Richard G. Forbes J. Appl. Phys. 104, 084303 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nthrough a maximum value of D=0 at this branch point. So a\nconvenient approach is to test the signs of D and dD \/dFP:\nbranch V1 is the physical solution if D\b0 and dD \/dFP\t0,\nbranch V3 is the physical solution if D\b0 and dD \/dFP\b0,\nand branch V4 is the physical solution if D\t0. The value of\ndD \/dFP is found numerically.\nThese remarks apply specifically to the solution of Eq.\n\u000128\u0002 in the context of FEVSC, and are not intended to apply\ngenerally to cubic equations.\n1C.
