In previous studies, NAc basal and amphetamine-produced\nDA transmission was altered by Group II mGluR agents. We tested whether NAc amphetamine\nCPP depends on Group II mGluR transmission.\nResults: NAc injections (0.5 \u00b5l\/side) of the Group II mGluR antagonist (2 S)- a-ethylglutamic acid\n(EGLU: 0.01\u20130.8 \u00b5g but not 0.001 \u00b5g) impaired CPP. The drug did not block the acute locomotor\neffect of amphetamine.\nConclusion: Results suggest that Group II mGluRs may be necessary for the establishment of NAc\namphetamine-produced CPP. These receptors may also mediate other forms of reward-related\nlearning dependent on this structure.\nBackground\nMetabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are impli-\ncated in learning and synaptic plasticity [1]. mGluRs have\nbeen classified into three groups: Group I, including\nmGluR1 and mGluR5; Group II, including mGluR2 and\nmGluR3; and Group III, including mGluR 4 and mGluR\n6\u20138. Group I stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) and\nphosphoinositide hydrolysis, whereas Group II and\nGroup III inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate\n(cAMP) formation most likely through a Gi-type protein\n[2,3]. Both cAMP and PLC are widely implicated in synap-\ntic plasticity [4]. Through their activity on G-proteins and\nother second messengers, mGluRs modulate ion channel\nconductances, transmission through ligand-gated chan-\nnels, as well as the activation of immediate early genes.\nTherefore, mGluRs are well suited to provide a means\nthrough which glutamate can induce synaptic changes at\nthe same synapses where it elicits fast responses. The role\nof Group I mGluRs in learning and plasticity has been\ncharacterized extensively. Group II mGluRs have received\nless attention [1].\nThere is evidence suggesting a role for Group II in synaptic\nplasticity in learning.

The role of Group II\nmGluRs in the acquisition of psychostimulant reward has\nnot been addressed in pharmacological studies.\nGroup II mGluRs modulate DA transmission. Locally\nadministered agonists reduce, whereas locally adminis-\ntered antagonists increase NAc DA levels [18,19]. Group II\nmGluR agonists also modulate amphetamine-produced\nDA release, enhancing it in drug-na\u00efve baboons [20] and\nimpairing it in amphetamine-sensitized rats [21]. In a\nrecent study mGluR2 receptor knockout mice showed\nenhanced cocaine-produced CPP [22]. Results showing\nthat Group II blockade enhanced basal DA release [19]\nsuggest that mGluR2-\/- mutants may exhibit behaviors\nrelated to psychostimulant sensitization [23], explaining\nthe hyperlocomotion in a novel environment and\nenhanced cocaine CPP observed in these mice. The acute\nrole of Group II mGluRs in the acquisition of NAc psycho-\nstimulant-produced CPP has not been investigated.\nIn the present studies, we used CPP [24] to test the\nhypothesis that NAc DA-mediated learning depends on\nGroup II mGluRs. A Group II mGluR antagonist was\nadministered directly into NAc and the acquisition of CPP\nbased on NAc amphetamine was assessed. We found that\nCPP was antagonized by the Group II antagonist. Part of\nthis research has been presented in abstract form [25].\nResults\nHistology\nA total of 97 rats completed testing. Three rats failed to\ncomplete the study due to illness or technical problems.\nThere was no relationship between the type and dose of\ndrug and illness observed in these animals. Cannula\nplacements were assessed for the remaining rats. A total of\n24 rats was excluded leaving 73 rats for subsequent analy-\nses. Figure 1 shows the location of cannula tips for all rats\nincluded in the analyses. Animals were classified as hits if\nthe tips of both cannulae were located in the core or shell\nregion of NAc.\nTime spent on each side during pre-exposure\nThe interpretation of CPP results is not straightforward if\nanimals have a natural avoidance of the to-be-drug-paired\nside. In such a case, an apparent increase in time spent on\nthat side after conditioning may be the result of decreased\navoidance of the drug-paired side or simply habituation\n[24]. To check for bias, we averaged time spent on the side\nthat would be paired with drug across the 3 habituation\ndays and compared it to time spent on the side that would\nbe paired with vehicle for each group. Paired samples t-\ntests revealed non-significant differences for all groups\n(see Table 1). Thus, rats did not avoid the to-be-drug-\npaired side during habituation and the CPP paradigm was\nunbiased.\nDrawings of coronal sections through the nucleus accumbens indicating sites of infusionFigure 1\nDrawings of coronal sections through the nucleus \naccumbens indicating sites of infusion.

Thus, additional analyses were performed to\ncompare tunnel time before and after conditioning (see\nTable 1). No significant differences were found.\nPlace conditioning\nTo induce CPP NAc amphetamine was paired with one\nside of the apparatus over four conditioning days. EGLU\nwas injected into NAc approximately ten minutes before\namphetamine. Vehicle alone was paired with the other\nside of the apparatus on alternate days. CPP was analyzed\nusing a dose (0.0, .001, .01, .4, .8 \u00b5g, or .01 alone) \u00d7 phase\n(habituation vs. test) mixed ANOVA with phase as the\nrepeated factor and time spent on the drug-paired side as\nthe dependent variable. The ANOVA yielded a main effect\nof phase [F(1, 67) = 5.362, p < .05] and a dose \u00d7 phase\ninteraction [F(5, 67) = 2.77, p < .05]. A one-way simple\neffects between-subjects ANOVA testing the effect of dose\nduring the habituation session was not significant. How-\never, a one-way simple effects ANOVA testing the effect of\ndose during the test session produced a main effect of\ndose [F(5, 67) = 2.99, p < .05]. Pairwise comparisons\nrevealed that on the test day rats conditioned with\namphetamine alone spent more time on the drug-paired\nside than rats conditioned with amphetamine plus 0.4 \u00b5g\nof EGLU. Rats conditioned with amphetamine plus the\nlowest EGLU dose (0.001 \u00b5g) spent more time on the\ndrug-paired side compared to all other groups except the\ngroup conditioned with amphetamine alone (Fisher LSD\nposthoc tests; all ps < .05). This confirmed the hypothesis\nthat EGLU impairs CPP acquisition. Rats receiving 0.01 \u00b5g\nof EGLU but no amphetamine showed no significant pref-\nerence or avoidance (Figure 2).\nLocomotor activity\nLocomotor activity during conditioning sessions was ana-\nlyzed for EGLU doses on the four amphetamine and four\nsaline conditioning days yielding a dose (0.0, 0.001, 0.01,\n0.4, 0.8 \u00b5g, 0.01 \u00b5g alone) \u00d7 phase (amphetamine vs.\nsaline) \u00d7 day (4 days per phase) 3-way mixed ANOVA\nwith phase and day as the within-subjects factors and total\nnumber of beam breaks per session as the dependent var-\niable.

In the saline phase, there was a main\neffect of EGLU dose [F(5, 67) = 5.35, p < .001]. The\namphetamine group showed higher activity than the 0.01,\n0.01 alone and 0.8 groups. The 0.001 \u00b5g group showed\nhigher activity than the higher EGLU doses (0.01, 0.4, 0.8\nand 0.01 alone; all ps < .05, Fisher LSD posthoc tests). Thus\namphetamine increased locomotor activity both in\ngroups that showed a CPP (0 and 0.001 doses) and in\ngroups that did not (0.01, 0.4 and 0.8 doses). Although\nactivity was significantly lower in all groups on vehicle\ndays, the two groups that showed a place preference had\nhigher locomotion in the drug-free phase (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nIn the present studies NAc amphetamine injections pro-\nduced CPP. This effect was impaired by a Group II mGluR\nantagonist. The CPP paradigm was unbiased; rats did not\nshow a systematic preference for one side of the apparatus\nover the other before conditioning. Also, the time rats\nspent in the tunnel before and after conditioning did not\nchange significantly showing that increases in time spent\non the drug-paired side were in fact due to changes in pref-\nerence. If EGLU produced conditioned place avoidance\non its own then simple additivity of this putative effect\nand the positive effect of amphetamine might explain the\nobserved pattern of results. To test this, we injected one\ngroup of rats with EGLU alone on what would normally\nhave been an amphetamine plus EGLU day using an\nEGLU dose that was found to affect amphetamine CPP\n(0.01 \u00b5g). On test day these rats did not show a preference\nor avoidance for the chamber normally paired with\namphetamine. Thus putative place conditioning proper-\nties of EGLU do not appear to account for the observed\nresults. Amphetamine stimulated locomotor activity.\nActivity among groups differed in drug-free vehicle ses-\nsions, with the groups that had received amphetamine\nalone or amphetamine plus 0.001 \u00b5g EGLU into NAc dur-\ning conditioning being more active.\nGroups that showed the CPP effect also showed higher\nactivity in the vehicle phase. It is difficult to explain this\nobservation. We know of no reports of a relationship\nbetween activity on vehicle conditioning days and the\npresence of a CPP effect. In our work we have repeatedly\nobserved locomotor stimulation on drug conditioning\ndays in groups that subsequently showed a CPP and\ngroups that did not. Further studies are needed to assess\nthe reliability of this finding and of activity differences\namong groups on vehicle conditioning days.\nEGLU administration did not affect the acute increases in\nlocomotor activity produced by amphetamine in the drug\nphase. EGLU has been reported to impair NAc ampheta-\nmine-produced locomotion using an amphetamine dose\nof 2.5 \u00b5g\/0.5 \u00b5l\/side [26]. We have previously reported\nthat NAc amphetamine doses ranging from 5.0\u201320.0 \u00b5g\nproduced similar levels of locomotor stimulation but a\ndose-dependent CPP effect (Beninger et al., 2003). For the\npresent study we chose a dose of amphetamine (20 \u00b5g)\nthat produced a significant CPP effect; this dose was eight\ntimes higher than the dose needed to produce motor stim-\nulation in the study of Kim et al. (2000). The doses of\nEGLU (0.09 and 0.88 \u00b5g) that they used to reduce the\nlocomotor stimulatory effect of amphetamine were com-\nparable to the higher doses used here. Our failure to rep-\nlicate their findings probably relates to our use of a\nsubstantially higher dose of amphetamine.\nThe NAc can be subdivided into core and shell subregions\n[27] and a number of studies suggest that these subregions\nmay be differentially involved in reward-related learning\nMean (+SEM) activity counts (per 30 min) during conditioning sessionsFigure 3\nMean (+SEM) activity counts (per 30 min) during \nconditioning sessions.

Our data did not permit a direct\ninvestigation of the relative contribution of the two subre-\ngions. An attempt was made to assess the possible role of\nthe core and shell by separating the groups into core and\nshell placements and performing post hoc analyses. How-\never only a few rats had both cannulae located within the\ncore subregion. These rats were distributed unevenly\namong the groups making it impossible to statistically\nanalyze the effect of region. It should be noted however\nthat we have previously reported significant ampheta-\nmine CPP using the same vehicle volume and injection\nparameters with placements in both the core and shell\n[33]. In other work, lower injection volumes have been\nused to study the differential role of each subregion [34].\nA more thorough investigation of the role of NAc subre-\ngions in CPP produced by local injections of ampheta-\nmine is awaited.\nDopaminergic innervation of the NAc, among other struc-\ntures, has been widely implicated in natural appetitive\nbehaviors and addiction [35]. NAc plays a critical role in\nthe acquisition of amphetamine-produced CPP [36,37].\nDA modulation of corticostriatal glutamatergic projec-\ntions is believed to underlie reward-related learning [38-\n40]. mGluRs may be involved in this modulation. Group\nI blockade impaired corticostriatal synaptic plasticity [41].\nGroup I mGluRs have been implicated in the acquisition\nof drug reward [42,43] and in mediating DA agonist-pro-\nduced changes in intracellular cascades widely implicated\nin memory and plasticity [1,44-46]. While Group II\nmGluRs have not been investigated as thoroughly in this\ncontext, several behavioral studies have demonstrated a\nrole for Group II mGluRs in learning. Group II mGluR\nactivation rescued a nonselective mGluR antagonist-pro-\nduced impairment of the spontaneous improvement in\nlever-pressing for food in mice [9]. Group II activation\nalso impaired lever-pressing for food in rats although this\neffect was schedule-dependent [8]. In a mouse study, sys-\ntemic cocaine-produced CPP was enhanced in Group II\nmutants [22]. In contrast, we found that acute administra-\ntions of the Group II mGluR antagonist EGLU impairs the\nacquisition of NAc amphetamine CPP. Our results are not\nin disagreement with this study. The mutants showed a\nbehavioral spectrum consistent with psychostimulant\nsensitization, including enhanced cocaine behavioral sen-\nsitization, hyperlocomotion in a novel environment and\nenhanced DA release after a systemic cocaine injection.\nThis observation is supported by work showing that a\nlocally administered mGluR II antagonist increased basal\nDA levels [19]. The observed phenotype may therefore\nreflect long term adaptations produced by changes in stri-\natal DA rather than acute effects of Group II mGluR block-\nade.\nLittle is known about the mechanism though which\nGroup II mGluRs modulate the acquisition of reward-\nrelated learning. Group II mGluR antagonist-produced\nimpairments in the acquisition of amphetamine CPP may\nbe mediated by effects on PKA. The acquisition of reward-\nrelated learning involves DA receptor-mediated PKA acti-\nvation [12]. Both the inhibition and direct activation of\nPKA impair reward-related learning and learning in other\ntasks [6,33,47]. In an in vitro study, a group II antagonist\nenhanced the stimulation of cAMP formation by forskolin\n[48]. Both a Group II agonist and antagonist impaired\nlearning in a step-down avoidance task [6]. The agonist-\nproduced impairment was rescued by coinfusion of for-\nskolin, suggesting that mGluR II may act in synchrony\nwith other receptors including mGluR I and DA1-like\nreceptors to produce an optimal level of PKA activation. In\nfact, work from our lab [33,49] has shown that activation\nof the cAMP\/PKA cascade impairs NAc amphetamine-pro-\nduced CPP \u2013 a finding that may parallel the effects of a\nmGluR antagonist on a tonically active Group II mGluR\nsignal.\nGroup II mGluRs may modulate plasticity by altering\nNMDA-DA receptor interactions in NAc. NMDA receptors\nare necessary for DA-mediated reward-related learning\n[50]. Group II activation alters NMDA-produced intracel-\nlular signaling in striatal neurons [51]. Group II inhibi-\ntion impairs NMDA-dependent hippocampal LTD [52]\nand corticostriatal NAc LTD [5]. NAc LTD may mediate\nNAc-dependent learning and psychostimulant-produced\nplasticity [53,54]. Reward-related learning is thought to\nbe mediated by the selective strengthening of behaviorally\nrelevant corticostriatal inputs to striatum [38-40]. Perhaps\nGroup II mGluRs are involved in the selective depression\nof synapses not related to current input in effect adjusting\nthe gain of behaviorally relevant glutamatergic efferents to\nthe NAc [54]. Further work will have to test this intriguing\npossibility.\nConclusion\nWe investigated the role of Group II mGluRs in reward-\nrelated learning using the CPP paradigm. This report is the\nfirst to test the effects of a Group II mGluR antagonist\napplied locally in the brain on the acquisition of CPP pro-\nduced by NAc injections of amphetamine. We showed\nthat the antagonist impaired NAc amphetamine-pro-\nduced CPP. The results are consistent with previous\nresearch showing a role for mGluRs in memory and plas-\nticity and DA-mediated reward-related learning. Group II\nmGluR modulation of DA effects in the NAc may involve\nchanges in PKA activation, changes in NMDA signaling or\nboth.Page 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Neuroscience 2006, 7:43 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2202\/7\/43Methods\nAnimals and surgery\nMale Wistar rats (Charles River, St. Constant, Quebec)\nweighing between 200\u2013250 g on arrival were housed in\npairs on a 12-hr reversed light-dark cycle (lights on at\n19:00 hr) at an average temperature of 21\u00b0C, humidity\n40\u201370%. Water and food (LabDiet 5001, PMI Nutrition\nIntl, Brentwood, MO) were freely available. Rats were\nhandled for about 1 min on each of 5 consecutive days\nafter arrival. The experimental protocol was approved by\nthe Animal Care Committee at Queen's University. All\nanimals were treated in full compliance with the Animals\nfor Research Act and relevant guidelines set by the Cana-\ndian Council on Animal Care.\nApproximately one wk after arrival at the colony, rats were\nanesthetized in an induction chamber using an inhalable\nanesthetic (5% isoflurane; Bimeda, Cambridge, ON)\nmixed with oxygen in a vaporizer system (Benson,\nMerkham, ON) and administered at 1.0 l\/min. Anesthe-\ntized animals were fitted to a stereotaxic apparatus and\nisoflurane was administered at a concentration of 2% or\nas needed to maintain anesthesia. The head was adjusted\nso that lambda and bregma were on the same horizontal\nplane. For analgesia, buprenorphine hydrochloride in\nsolution (0.15 mg\/kg; Reckitt & Colman, Richmond, VA)\nwas injected subcutaneously preoperatively. Ketoprofen\n(1.5 mg\/kg; Merial, Baie d'Urf\u00e9, QC) was injected imme-\ndiately after surgery and on three subsequent days postop-\neratively. The experimenter shaved the rat's head and\napplied betadine solution with a cotton tip applicator\nbefore incising the skin. Holes were drilled into the skull\nand 23 gauge (0.64 mm diameter) stainless-steel guide\ncannulae were chronically implanted bilaterally into the\nNAc, with coordinates: 1.6 mm anterior to bregma, 1.4\nmm lateral to the midline and 6.7 mm ventral from the\nskull surface [55]. The guide cannulae were held in place\nby four stainless-steel screws and dental acrylic. Stainless\nsteel wire stylets (0.31 mm diameter) flush with the end\nof the guide cannulae were put in place to prevent occlu-\nsion. Rats were allowed approximately one wk to recover\nbefore the start of behavioral testing. Behavioral data were\nanalyzed if the tips of the cannulae were located in the\ncore or shell region of NAc.\nDrug infusion\nThe Group II mGluR antagonist (2 S)- a-ethylglutamic\nacid (EGLU; Tocris, Ellisville, MO) was dissolved in saline\nbefore the beginning of the experiment and stored at -\n20\u00b0C. The pharmacological properties of this agent have\nbeen well documented. EGLU impaired presynaptic\nmGluR agonist-produced motoneuron depolarization\nbelieved to be mediated by Group II mGluRs and inhib-\nited mGluR agonist binding in mGluR2-transfected cell\nmembranes [56].\nAmphetamine sulfate (USP, Rockvill, MD) was dissolved\nin saline daily before each set of injections. Central injec-\ntions into the NAc were made with a microinfusion pump\n(KD Scientific, Holliston, MA). Injectors were glued to\npolyethylene tubing (0.75 mm o.d.) filled with distilled\nwater. The tubing was connected to two 10 \u00b5l microsy-\nringes (Microliter #701; Hamilton, Reno, NV) mounted\non the microinfusion pump. Drugs were backloaded into\nthe injectors by aspiration with the two syringes. Rats were\nhand-held as the experimenter removed the stylets from\nthe guide cannulae and inserted the two injectors (0.31\nmm o.d.). The injectors projected 1.2 mm beyond the\nguide cannulae.\nEGLU (0.001, 0.01, 0.4 or 0.8 \u00b5g\/0.5 \u00b5l\/side) was injected\nbilaterally over 30 sec. The highest EGLU dose was similar\nto a dose previously reported to impair NAc ampheta-\nmine-produced locomotion [26]. After the drug was deliv-\nered, the injectors were left in place for another 30 sec to\nfacilitate diffusion, after which they were slowly retracted\nfrom the guide cannulae. Amphetamine (20.0 \u00b5g\/0.5 \u00b5l\/\nside) was injected approximately 10 min later using the\nsame procedure. This amphetamine dose was much\nhigher than the one reported by Kim et al. (2000) and has\nbeen found to produce reliable CPP in previous studies\nfrom our lab (e.g. [49,57]). Place conditioning began\nimmediately after amphetamine injection. Groups were\ntested drug-free.\nApparatus\nThe 4 testing chambers each consisted of two rectangular\ncompartments (38 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 34 cm) connected with a tunnel\n(8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 cm). Two different spatial features were varied\nacross the 4 testing chambers. The compartment walls\nwere either urethane-sealed wood or alternating 1 cm-\nwide black and white vertical stripes and were covered\nwith clear Plexiglas. The floor was either wire bars 1 cm\napart running perpendicular to the tunnel, or a wire grid\nwith openings of 1 cm2. This resulted in 4 possible com-\npartment types, distributed as left or right compartment\nacross 4 different testing chambers. Each compartment\nhad a Plexiglas top with a number of circular ventilation\nholes. The tunnel was fitted with guillotine-type doors,\nwhich could be closed to prevent movement from one\ncompartment to the other. Two infrared emitters and\ndetectors (height 5.0 cm) in each compartment and 2 in\nthe tunnel (height 5.0 cm) were used to monitor move-\nment between and within compartments and to record\ntime spent in each compartment and the tunnel. The\nnumber of beam breaks during conditioning sessions was\nused as a measure of locomotion. Each of the 4 testing\nchambers was housed in a dimly lit (7.5 Watt), sound-\nattenuated and ventilated wooden box. Indirect light\nreached the rat though the Plexiglas tops of the compart-\nments. Data from the sensors were collected on a 6809Page 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Neuroscience 2006, 7:43 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2202\/7\/43microcontroller using custom made software and trans-\nferred to a Macintosh computer for analyses. For further\ndetails of the apparatus see [58].\nBehavioral procedure\nTraining and testing occurred during the day (7:00\u201319:00\nhr). Rats were tested in groups of 4 using a different testing\nchamber for each rat. The experimental protocol consisted\nof 3 habituation sessions, 8 conditioning sessions, and 1\ntest session. Each rat completed one session per day for a\ntotal of 12 days.\nHabituation\nAt the start of each 15-min session the rat was placed in\none compartment of the box \u2013 left compartment for half\nthe rats and right compartment for the other half. Tunnel\ndoors were open allowing the animals to move freely\nbetween the two compartments. Activity sensors recorded\nthe amount of time spent on each side and in the tunnel.\nConditioning\nOver 8 30-min sessions carried out on 8 consecutive days,\nmGluR antagonists and amphetamine were injected into\nthe NAc on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and vehicle on days 2, 4, 6\nand 8. Injection of the mGluR antagonist was followed by\nan injection of amphetamine approximately 10 min later.\nRats received only one injection on vehicle days. Immedi-\nately after amphetamine or vehicle injection, depending\non conditioning day, the rat was placed in one of the two\ncompartments with the tunnel doors closed preventing\nmovement into the other compartment or the tunnel.\nHalf the rats were confined to the left side on drug days\nand to the right side on vehicle days. The other half were\nconfined to the right side on drug days and to the left side\non vehicle days. In this way, any given compartment was\npaired with drug for some animals and with vehicle for\nothers. Number of beam breaks was recorded for each rat\nto assess locomotion.\nSix groups were tested. Five groups received amphetamine\n(20 \u00b5g\/0.5 \u00b5l\/side) immediately before placement into\nthe conditioning compartment; these injections were pre-\nceded 10 min earlier by saline or EGLU doses of 0.001,\n0.01, 0.4 or 0.8 \u00b5g\/0.5 \u00b5l\/side. One additional group\nreceived EGLU (0.01 \u00b5g) 10 min before and saline imme-\ndiately before placement into the conditioning compart-\nment. This group assessed possible effects of EGLU alone\non side preference.\nTesting\nTesting occurred on the day immediately following condi-\ntioning. The session lasted 15 min and was identical to\nhabituation sessions. The start side was the same for each\nrat on test and habituation days. Time spent on each side\nand in the tunnel was recorded.\nData analysis\nPaired samples t-tests were used to compare tunnel time\nbefore and after conditioning. To check for side bias,\nanother set of t-tests compared time spent on the drug-\npaired side to time spent on the vehicle-paired side before\nconditioning. The amount of time spent on the drug-\npaired side was averaged across the 3 habituation days.\nCPP was analyzed using a mixed dose \u00d7 phase (habitua-\ntion vs. test) analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by\nrestricted ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons. In addi-\ntion, the number of beam breaks for each rat on each of\nthe 8 conditioning days was summed and used as an\nindex of motor activity. Activity data were analyzed using\na dose \u00d7 session type \u00d7 day mixed ANOVA.\nHistology\nAfter completion of the experiment, rats were placed in an\nairtight chamber and euthanized with CO2. Brains were\nremoved and preserved in a 10% formalin solution for at\nleast 72 hrs. Coronal sections 60 \u00b5m thick from through-\nout the cannulated region were obtained by slicing the\nbrains on a cryostat at -20\u00b0C. The sections were mounted\non gelatin-coated glass slides and stained with cresyl vio-\nlet. Judgments about the cannulae placements in the NAc\nwere made by an observer who was blind to the results for\nindividual animals. Brains with cannula tips in the shell\nand\/or core regions of the NAc were included in subse-\nquent analyses.\nAuthors' contributions\nTVG carried out the behavioral studies, participated in the\ndesign of the studies and the statistical analysis of the\ndata, and drafted the manuscript. RJB conceived the study,\nparticipated in its design and coordination, and in revis-\ning the manuscript. Both authors read and approved the\nfinal manuscript.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engi-\nneering Research Council of Canada to RJB.\nReferences\n1.
