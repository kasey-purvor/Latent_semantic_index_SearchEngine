If little or no quantitative information is available, but \nsufficient qualitative knowledge exists, qualitative forecasting approaches are appropriate. When \nsufficient quantifiable information about the past is available and the objective numerical \nmeasurements are consistent over the historical period, quantitative forecasting should be adopted. \nConsidering the number of published studies, quantitative forecasting dominates the tourism literature. \n  \n2 \nQuantitative forecasting methods can be further divided into two subcategories: causal and non-causal \nmethods, depending on if there are any explanatory variables included or not in the models. Causal \nmethods, principally the econometric models, can not only predict the trends of future tourism \ndemand, but also interpret the causes of variations in tourism demand. Hence, causal forecasting \nmethods can provide useful information for both policy evaluation in the public sector and strategy \nformulation in various tourism businesses. This paper focuses on the latest developments of \neconometric forecasting methods and their applications in the tourism context. A particular emphasis \nwill be given to the TVP estimation approach applied to both single-equation and system-of-equation \nmodels.   \nTVP SINGLE-EQUATION MODELS \nOne of the assumptions behind conventional fixed-parameter econometric techniques is that the \ncoefficients of the models are constant over the whole sample period. This implies that the economic \nstructure generating the data does not change over time (Judge et al, 1985). However, the changing \neconomic environment may induce people to react differently at various points in time, both \nquantitatively and qualitatively to given stimulations. To overcome the limitations of the traditional \nfixed-parameter models, a more advanced and flexible econometric method: the TVP model, has been \ndeveloped, which allows one to understand and forecast consumer behaviour more accurately. The \nTVP model relaxes the restriction on the parameter constancy and takes account of the possibility of \nparameter changes over time. The TVP technique was initially developed in the engineering science \nand was recently applied to socioeconomic studies, mostly adopted in the single-equation modelling \nframework.  \nTVP Long-Run Model (TVP-LRM) \nTVP models are normally specified in a state space (SS) form. SS modelling assumes that the dynamic \nfeatures of the system under study are determined by the unobserved variables associated with a series \nof observations (Durbin and Koopman, 2001). The SS presentation allows unobserved variables to be \nincluded into, and estimated along with, the observable variables. By inferring the relevant properties \nof the unobserved series from the knowledge of the observations, the evolution of the system can be \nmore precisely described and predicted. A linear SS model can be written as:  \n \n,tttt Zy \u03b5\u03b1 +\u2032=  ),,0(~ tHN\u03b5  Tt ,...,1=    (1) \n,1 tttt T \u03b7\u03b1\u03b1 +=+  ),(~ 111 PaN\u03b1 , ),,0(~ tt QN\u03b7    (2) \n \nwhere ty  is the dependent variable; tZ  is a vector of  independent variables; t\u03b1  is an unobserved \nvector called state vector; t\u03b5  refers to the temporary disturbance and t\u03b7  the permanent disturbance, \nt\u03b5  and t\u03b7  are Gaussian disturbances, which are serially independent and independent of each other at \nall time points; The matrices tT , tH  and tQ  are initially assumed to be known. Equation (1) is called \nthe observation equation, and Equation (2) called the state equation. In most of the economic \napplications, the evolution of t\u03b1  is assumed to follow a multivariate random walk. i.e., \nttt \u03b7\u03b1\u03b1 +=+1 . This assumption is also applied in the current study. The initial value of t\u03b1 , i.e., 1\u03b1 , \ncan be estimated by maximum likelihood from the first few observations of ty  and tZ . 1P  is the \n  \n3 \nvariance of \n1\u03b1  (Durbin and Koopman, 2001; Harvey, 1989). \n \nThe rationale behind this model is that the evolution of the concerning system over time is determined \nby t\u03b1  according to the state equation. Meanwhile, since it is unobservable, the analysis must be based \non the observations of ty , that is, tZ  and 1\u2212tT  are dependent on 1y ,\u2026, 1\u2212ty . \n \nThe definition of the state vector t\u03b1  for a particular model depends on its construction. Its elements \nhave a substantive interpretation, e.g., as a trend or seasonality. From a technical point of view, the \npurpose of specifying a SS form is to \u201cset up t\u03b1  in such a way that it contains all the relevant \ninformation on the system at time t and that it does so by having as small a number of elements as \npossible\u201d (Harvey, 1989, p102). \n \nOnce a TVP model has been specified in a SS form, the Kalman filter procedure (Kalman, 1960) can \nbe employed to calculate the optimal (minimum mean square error, MMSE) estimator of the state \nvector at time t, given the information available up to time t-1. Since the Kalman filter yields \nTTTT\nTa \u03b1\n1|1 ++\n=  and the MMSE estimator of \n1+T\n\u03b1  given all the observations, the one-step-ahead \nforecast can be directly produced by:  \nTT\naZy TTT |11|1\n~~\n+++\n\u2032=      (3) \nwhere \n1\n~\n+TtZ  is the vector of one-step-ahead forecasts of explanatory variables such as the disposable \nincome or the consumer price index. The forecasts of these macroeconomic indicators are normally \navailable from the national statistics office, or projected using the appropriate non-causal time-series \nforecasting approach. \n \nCorrespondingly, the multi-step forecasts can also be recursively generated. Full illustration of the \nKalman filter technique is available from Harvey (1989).  \n \nSince the observation equation (1) is based on the classical econometric model\u2014the static or long-run \ncointegration (CI) model, the TVP specification of Equation (1) is known as TVP-LRM.  \nTVP Error Correction Model (TVP-ECM) \nEquation (1) suggests that the TVP-LRM emphases the evolution of explanatory variables and its \neffect on the dependent variable. Although it is useful to examine the annual demand for tourism over \na long period, the dynamic changes of tourism demand in the short term are also concerned by tourism \nbusinesses. To serve this purpose, an error correction model (ECM) could be considered. Engle and \nGranger (1987) showed that in a system of two variables, if a long-run equilibrium relationship exists, \nthe short-term disequilibrium relationship between the two variables can be represented by an ECM. \nThe ECM reflects the mechanism of the short-run adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium in the \nsystem. If there are more than two variables in the system, it is possible that there will be more than one \nCI relationships, and correspondingly the ECM becomes a vector ECM.  \n \nThe conventional fixed-parameter ECM assumes that the speed of short-run adjustment is constant \nover time. In the changing environment such an assumption seems to be too strict and arbitrary. In fact, \n\u201ceven assuming the existence of a stable long-run combination, one may find signs of instability in the \n  \n4 \nshort-run adjustment mechanism\u201d (Ramajo, 2001). Therefore, it is more realistic to specify the TVP \nshort-run dynamics within the long-run equilibrium framework. Such a specification is termed \nTVP-ECM. Compared to the classical long-run TVP model, the TVP-ECM adds one more \nrestriction\u2014existence of the CI relationship, and focuses on the short-term adjustment, the speeds of \nwhich vary over time.  \n \nAfter confirming the acceptance of a CI relationship, a TVP-ECM can be estimated. Similar to the \nTVP-LRM, the TVP-ECM can also be specified in a SS form.  \n \nIn the case where the lag length of the differenced variables is zero, which has been proved to be \nappropriate in most tourism studies using annual data, the observation equation of the TVP-ECM can \nbe written as: \ntttttt veZy ++\u2032\u2206=\u2206 \u22121\u02c6\u03bb\u03b2      (4) \n \nwhere \u03b1\u02c6\u02c6 111 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2032\u2212= ttt Zye are the OLS residuals from the CI function ,ttt eZy +\u2032= \u03b1  where \n\u03b1 (without a subscript) is a fixed parameter vector. 1\u02c6 \u2212te  represents the error correction mechanism. t\u03b2  \nand t\u03bb are the TVP vectors, and tv  is the temporary disturbance term. The state equation still takes the \nsame form as Equation (2), and ),( \u2032= ttt \u03bb\u03b2\u03b1 . The estimation method is the same as that of the \nTVP-LRM. \n \nIt should be noted that dummy variables can be readily incorporated into both the TVP-LRM and the \nTVP-ECM, in order to capture the effects of one-off events such as the Iraqi War and 9.11 terrorist \nattack. Since these one-off events are regarded as exogenous factors for tourism demand, it is not \nnecessary to estimate the parameters using the TVP technique and the fixed parameters are appropriate \nfor dummy variables in a TVP model. \nApplications of TVP Models in Tourism \nTVP models in both long-run and dynamic forms have been successfully applied in economic studies \nsuch as modelling and forecasting rational expectation formations, inflation, and demand for money \nand other products (e.g., Bohara and Sauer, 1992; Swamy et al, 1990; and Hackl and Westlund, 1996). \nHowever, applications of TVP models to tourism forecasting are still rare, with the following notable \nexceptions. Riddington (1999) utilised the TVP-LRM to analyse and forecast ski demand in Scotland. \nSong and Witt (2000) used the TVP-LRM to examine the demand elasticity changes over time \nregarding the demand for Korean tourism by UK and USA residents. Li et al (2005a) and Song et al \n(2003b) showed the superiority of the TVP-LRM to its fixed-parameter counterparts in terms of \nforecasting accuracy in their studies on tourism demand in Denmark and Thailand, respectively. Li et \nal (2006) examined the forecasting performance of both TVP-LRM and TVP-ECM relative to a \nnumber of fixed-parameter econometric and time series models in an empirical study of UK tourism \ndemand in some key Western European destinations. Table 1 shows that the overall performance of the \nTVP-LRM in terms of demand level forecasting is the best amongst all the models in the comparison. \nThe TVP-ECM always performs above average. As far as demand growth is concerned, the TVP-LRM \nand TVP-ECM outperform all of their competitors. In particular, the TVP-ECM generates the most \naccurate one-year-ahead and two-years-ahead forecasts. The consistently superior performance of the \nTVP-LRM and TVP-ECM suggests that the TVP technique is an effective tool for tourism demand \n  \n5 \nforecasting. \n \n  \n6 \n \n \nTable 1 Forecasting Accuracy over Different Forecasting Horizons \nHorizon Measure Naive ARIMA Static ADLM VAR WB-ECM JML-ECM EG-ECM TVP-LRM TVP-ECM \n1-year-ahead MAPE 0.767  (8) 0.796  (9) 1.405  (10) 0.480  (1) 0.591  (5) 0.691  (6) 0.550  (4) 0.700 (7) 0.510  (3) 0.483  (2) \n2-years-ahead MAPE 1.101  (9) 1.089  (8) 1.778  (10) 0.660  (2) 0.786  (6) 1.066  (7) 0.723  (4) 0.734 (5) 0.586  (1) 0.680  (3) \n3-years-ahead MAPE 1.169 (10) 1.129  (9) 1.016   (8) 0.307  (2) 0.870  (7) 0.600  (6) 0.332  (3) 0.487 (4) 0.218  (1) 0.534  (5) \n4-years-ahead MAPE 1.293  (9) 1.374  (10) 1.269   (8) 0.416  (2) 1.208  (7) 0.948  (6) 0.506  (3) 0.709 (5) 0.202  (1) 0.700  (4) \nOverall MAPE 1.082  (8) 1.097  (9) 1.367  (10) 0.466  (2) 0.864  (7) 0.826  (6) 0.528  (3) 0.654 (5) 0.379  (1) 0.599  (4) \n1-year-ahead MAE 0.176  (7) 0.177  (8) 0.298  (10) 0.108  (2) 0.121  (5) 0.145  (6) 0.112  (4) 0.181 (9)  0.111  (3) 0.085  (1) \n2-years-ahead MAE 0.162  (10) 0.153  (9) 0.128  (8) 0.102  (3) 0.117  (6) 0.122  (7) 0.107  (5) 0.105 (4) 0.098  (2) 0.086  (1) \n3-years-ahead MAE 0.171  (9) 0.172  (10) 0.140  (7) 0.105  (4) 0.151  (8) 0.126  (6) 0.085  (2) 0.097 (3) 0.085  (1) 0.107  (5) \n4-years-ahead MAE 0.144  (6) 0.145  (7) 0.209  (10) 0.102  (2) 0.133  (5) 0.174  (9) 0.107  (3) 0.164 (8) 0.081  (1) 0.122  (4) \nOverall MAE 0.164  (9) 0.162  (8) 0.194  (10) 0.104  (4) 0.131  (5) 0.142  (7) 0.103  (3) 0.137 (6) 0.094  (1) 0.100  (2) \nNote: The upper half of the table refers to the forecasts of level variables, and the lower differenced variables.

Eadington and Redman \n(1991) noted that the single-equation econometric forecasting approach is incapable of analysing the \ninterdependence of budget allocations to different consumer goods\/services. For example, the tourism \ndecision-making involves a choice among a group of alternative destinations. A change of price in one \ndestination may affect tourists\u2019 decisions on travelling to a number of alternative destinations, and also \ninfluence their expenditures in those destinations. Clearly, the single-equation methodology cannot \nadequately model the influence of a change in tourism price in a particular destination on the demand \nfor travelling to all other destinations. Meanwhile, the single-equation approach cannot be used to test \nthe symmetry and adding-up hypotheses, which are associated with the existing demand theories.  \n \nThe system-of-equations approach initiated by Stone (1954) overcomes the above limitations. By \nincluding a group of equations (one for each consumer good) in the system and estimating them \nsimultaneously, this approach permits the examination of how consumers choose bundles of goods in \norder to maximise their utility with budget constraints. Although there are a number of system \napproaches available, the almost ideal demand system (AIDS), introduced by Deaton and Muellbauer \n(1980), has been the most commonly used method for analysing consumer behaviour. As the authors \ndescribed, the AIDS model possesses the following attractive features: \n \n\u00b7 It gives an arbitrary first-order approximation to any demand system;  \n\u00b7 It satisfies the axioms of consumers without invoking parallel linear Engel curves; \n\u00b7 It has a functional form which complies with known household-budget data;  \n\u00b7 It is easy to estimate and largely avoid the need for non-linear estimation;  \n\u00b7 The restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry can be tested though linear restrictions on fixed \nparameters in the model;  \n\u00b7 It has a flexible functional form and does not impose any a priori restrictions on the elasticities, \nwhich means any good in the system can be either inferior or normal, and either a substitute or a \ncomplement to the others (Fujii et al, 1985). \n \nAlthough the Rotterdam and translog models also hold some of these features, neither of them contains \nall these features simultaneously. Having explicit theoretical underpinnings, AIDS is more appropriate \nfor tourism demand analysis. \nStatic LAIDS \nThe original AIDS initialised by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) takes a static functional form and is \nspecified as: \n \ni\nj\nijijii Pxpw \u03bd\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1 +++= \u2211 )\/log(log    (5) \n \nwhere wi is the budget share of the ith good, pi is the price of the ith good, x is total expenditure on all \ngoods in the system, P is the aggregate price index for the system, vi is the disturbance term, \n),0(~\n2\nii Nv \u03c3 ,  n is the number of the products in the system, i\u03b1 , i\u03b2  and ij\u03b3  are the parameters to \n  \n8 \nbe estimated. The aggregate price index P is defined as: \n\u2211 \u2211\u2211++=\ni i j\njiijii pppaP loglog\n2\n1\nloglog 0 \u03b3\u03b1                      (6) \n \nwhere 0a is a parameter to be estimated. Replacing P with the Stone\u2019s (1954) price index (P*) defined \nby Equation (7), the linearly approximated AIDS is derived and termed \u201cLAIDS\u201d.  \n \n\u2211=\ni\nii pwP log*log       (7) \n \nThe LAIDS with dummy variables can then be written as: \n \nik\nk\nik\nj\nijijii vdum\nP\nx\npw ++\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb++= \u2211\u2211 \u03d5\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1\n*\nloglog   (k=1, 2, \u2026, m)   (8) \n \nwhere kdum  is a dummy variable, which handles the intervention of the exogenous shock; m is the \nnumber of dummy variables included in the system; ik\u03d5  is a parameter to be estimated.  \n \nEquation (8) can be re-written more compactly in the vector-matrix notation: \n \ntttt vdumzw ++\u03a0= \u03d5      (9) \n \nwhere tz  is a q-vector of intercept, log prices and log real total expenditure variables ( 2+= nq ); \u03a0  \nand \u03d5  are )( qn\u00d7  and mn\u00d7 parameter matrices, respectively; )...,( ,21 \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032=\u03a0 n\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 , where i\u03c0   is a \nq-vector. The LAIDS model is normally estimated by the iterated seemingly unrelated regression \n(SUR) logarithm (see Zellner, 1962 for details). \n \nTo comply with the properties of demand theory, some restrictions are imposed on the parameters in \nEquation (8), such as Adding-up (\u2211 =\ni\ni 1\u03b1 , \u2211 =\ni\nij 0\u03b3 , 0=\u2211\ni\ni\u03b2  and 0=\u2211\ni\nik\u03d5 ), Homogeneity \n(\u2211 =\nj\nij 0\u03b3 ) and Symmetry ( jiij \u03b3\u03b3 = ). Subject to the satisfaction of the above restrictions, the \nunrestricted LAIDS in Equation (8) can be further written as two restricted versions: the homogeneous \nLAIDS and the homogeneous and symmetric LAIDS. The latter is the most theoretically sound, and \nthe further analysis and forecasting should be based on this version. However, the hypotheses of the \nabove restrictions might be rejected by statistical tests in empirical studies. In this case, the \nunrestricted LAIDS or homogeneous LAIDS has to be considered.  \n  \nWithin the LAIDS framework, the demand elasticities can be calculated as: the expenditure \nelasticity\niiix w\/1 \u03b2\u03b5 += , the uncompensated price elasticity ijiiijijij www \/\/ \u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u03b5 \u2212+\u2212=  and the \ncompensated price elasticity jiijijij ww ++\u2212= \/\n* \u03b3\u03b4\u03b5  ( ij\u03b4 =1 for i=j; ij\u03b4 =0 for i\u2260j). The elasticities \ncalculated from the LAIDS model have a stronger theoretical basis than the single-equation models. \nTherefore, the LAIDS model can provide more reliable information for tourism demand analysis.  \n  \n9 \nDynamic LAIDS \nIn the static LAIDS, which is also known as the long-run LAIDS model, it is implicitly assumed that \nthere is no difference between consumers\u2019 short-run and long-run behaviour, i.e. the consumers\u2019 \nbehaviour is always in \u201cequilibrium\u201d. However, in reality, habit persistence, adjustment costs, \nimperfect information, incorrect expectations and misinterpreted real price changes often prevent \nconsumers from adjusting their expenditure instantly to price and income changes (Anderson and \nBlundell, 1983). Therefore, until full adjustment takes place consumers are \u201cout of equilibrium\u201d. This \nis one of the reasons why most static LAIDS models cannot satisfy the theoretical restrictions (Duffy, \n2002). Moreover, the static LAIDS pays no attention to the statistical properties of the data and the \ndynamic specification arising from time series analysis. It is well known that most economic data are \nnon-stationary, and the presence of unit roots may invalidate the asymptotic distribution of estimators. \nTherefore, traditional statistics such as t, F and R\n2\n are unreliable, and the least squares estimation of the \nstatic LAIDS tends be spurious (Chambers, 1993; Granger and Newbold, 1974). Furthermore, the \nstatic LAIDS is unlikely to generate accurate short-run forecasts (Chambers and Nowman, 1997).  \nHowever, the introduction of the CI\/ECM into the LAIDS models can solve the above problems, as the \nerror correction LAIDS\u2014EC-LAIDS augments the long-run equilibrium relationship with a short-run \nadjustment mechanism.  \n \nBefore examining the CI relationship, all variables concerned need to be tested for unit roots (orders of \nintegration). The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) statistics can be employed \nfor this purpose. Once the orders of integration of the variables have been identified, either the Engle \nand Granger (1987) two-stage approach or the Johansen (1988) maximum likelihood approach can be \nused to test for the CI relationship among the variables in the models (Song and Witt, 2000). \n \nFollowing Engle and Granger\u2019s two-stage approach, the EC-LAIDS can be written in the following \nform (Edgerton et al, 1996; Chambers and Nowman, 1997; Duffy, 2002): \n  \nttttttt vdumzwdumLzLBwLA +\u2212\u03a0\u2212\u0393+\u2206+\u2206=\u2206 \u2212\u2212\u2212 )()()()( 111 \u03d5\u03c6   (10) \n \nwhere \u2211 =+=\nl\ni\ni\niLAILA 1)( , \u2211 ==\nh\ni\ni\niLBLB 0)(  and \u2211 ==\ns\ni\ni\niLL 0)( \u03c6\u03c6  are matrix polynomials in the \nlag operator L. l and h can be determined by using order selection techniques. \n)( 111 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u03a0\u2212 ttt dumzw \u03d5  is the error correction term. Given that annual data are used, most tourism \ndemand studies employing ECMs have shown that setting the lag length of differenced variables equal \nto zero is appropriate. Thus, Equation (10) can be reduced to the following form (see Durbarry and \nSinclair, 2003): \n \nttttttt vdumzwdumzBw +\u2212\u03a0\u2212\u0393+\u2206+\u2206=\u2206 \u2212\u2212\u2212 )( 111 \u03d5\u03c6    (11) \n \nwhere B is an )( qn\u00d7  matrix, and \u03c6  is an )( mn\u00d7  matrix; \u0393  is an )( nn\u00d7 matrix. Considering the \ndegrees of freedom and statistical significance of the estimates of the error correction terms, some \nempirical studies, such as Ray (1985), used a more restrictive formulation, involving only the \ndisequilibrium in the own budget share in each equation. In other words, \u0393  becomes diagonal, and \nthe off-diagonal terms, the estimates of which are normally insignificant, are restricted to zero.  \nThe diagonal form of \u0393  also implies that ii\u0393  are equal, i.e., \u0393  is a negative scalar.  \n  \n10 \n \nEquation (11) reflects both long-run and short-run effects in the same model. In the short run, changes \nin expenditure shares depend on changes in prices, real expenditure, dummies, and the disequilibrium \nerror in the previous period. In the long run, when all differenced terms become zero, Equation (11) is \nreduced to Equation (9), i.e., the system achieves its steady state.  \nTVP-LAIDS \nAs has been addressed above, TVP models have advantages over their fixed-parameter counterparts. \nIn addition, various empirical studies have shown the superior forecasting performance of TVP models \nin comparison to other conventional econometric models. Meanwhile, the superiority of the AIDS \nmodel over the single-equation approach has also been evaluated. Hence, combination of the TVP \ntechnique and the AIDS\/LAIDS model is likely to create both theoretically sound and more accurate \nforecasting methods. Consistent with the development of LAIDS specifications, the TVP-LAIDS \nfamily comprises both the long-run version\u2014TVP-LR-LAIDS, and the short-run dynamic \nTVP-EC-LAIDS, depending on whether the error correction mechanism is incorporated into the \nLAIDS specification. \nTVP-LR-LAIDS \nRelaxing the fixed-parameter restriction, the unrestricted long-run LAIDS of Equation (8) can be \nre-written as a TVP system. It should be noted that once the estimates of the fixed-parameter LAIDS \nhave shown the statistical significance of dummy variables, they should also be included into TVP \nformulations, but as exogenous variables they have fixed parameters (Ramajo, 2001). Therefore each \nequation of the TVP-LR-LAIDS can be written in the following one-dimension SS form:  \n \nittiittit udumzw ++\u2032= \u03d1\u03c0  ),,0(~ tit HNu  Tt ,...,1=   (12) \nititit \u03be\u03c0\u03c0 +=+1  ),(~ 111 PcN\u03c0 , ),0(~ tit QN\u03be   (13) \n \nwhere itw  and itu  are the ith elements of vectors tw  and tu  respectively; i\u03d1  is the ith row of \u03d1 ; it\u03be  \nis a q-vector of disturbance terms. it\u03c0  is an unobserved state vector, and follows a multivariate \nrandom walk. The matrices tH  and tQ are initially assumed to be known. \n \nCorrespondingly, the whole system can be specified as: \nttttt udum\u03a0zw ++= \u03d1\n**\n      (14) \n***\n1 ttt \u03be\u03a0\u03a0 +=+       (15) \nwhere ,* tnt zIz \u2032\u2297=  ),...,( 2,1\n* \u2032=\u03a0 ntttt \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0  and .),...,,( 21\n* \u2032= ntttt \u03be\u03be\u03be\u03be  \nIn homogeneity or symmetry restricted LAIDS, the restrictions (M), which are linear, can be written \nas:  \n*\ntGM \u03a0=         (16) \nwhere G is the coefficient matrix of the restriction. \nCombining the linear restriction of Equation (16) with Equation (14) gives a new augmented \nmeasurement equation in the form:  \n  \n11 \nttttt UDZW ++=\n**\u03a0\n     (17) \nwhere \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\nM\nw\nW\nt\nt ; \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\nG\nz\nZ tt\n*\n*\n; \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n0\nt\nt\ndum\nD\n\u03d1\n; \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n=\n0\nt\nt\nu\nU . \n \nTVP-EC-LAIDS \nIn the pervious sections, the TVP-ECM and EC-LAIDS have been introduced. Both of these models \nhave a particular emphasis on the short-term dynamics of the system concerned. A further combination \nbetween them generates the TVP-EC-LAIDS, which is so far the most advanced development of the \nLAIDS family. Specifically, the TVP-EC-LAIDS features the varying short-term adjustment towards \nthe long-run steady state of demand. \n \nAs with Equations (12) and (13), each equation of the unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS can be described \nas the following SS form: \n \n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u2206\u03b8\u03c0\u2206 ittiittit udumzw ++\u2032= )(       (18) \n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u03be\u03c0\u03c0 ititit +=+1       (19) \n \nwhere ),( 11 \u2032\u03a0\u2212\u2206= \u2212\u2212\n\u2206\ntttt zwzz ; \n\u2206\nit\u03c0 is the corresponding parameter vector; i\u03b8  is the ith row of \u03b8 ; \n\u2206\nitu  is the ith item of \n\u2206\ntu , the disturbance vector of the measurement equation; and\n\u2206\nit\u03be  is  the \ndisturbance vector of the state equation. \n \nCorrespondingly, the state space form of the whole unrestricted TVP-EC-LAIDS is specified as: \n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u2206\u03b8\u03a0\u2206 ttttt udumzw ++\u2032= )(\n*      (20) \n*\n1\n\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u03be\u03a0\u03a0 ttt +=+       (21) \n \nwhere )(1\n* \u2032\u2297= \u2206+\n\u2206\ntqt zIz ; ),...,,( 21 \u2032=\n\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03a0 ntttt ; .),...,,( 21\n* \u2032= \u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206 ntttt \u03be\u03be\u03be\u03be  \n \nOnce the unrestricted LAIDS passes the restriction tests, the homogeneity-restricted or both \nhomogeneity and symmetry-restricted version of TVP-LR-LAIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS can be \nestimated using the Kalman filter algorithm, and forecasts can be generated correspondingly. \n \nEstimations of the single-equation TVP models, the static and dynamic (fixed-parameter) LAIDS, as \nwell as the single-equation estimation of TVP-LAIDS models (i.e., each equation of the system is \nestimated separately), can all be carried out using the computing program Eviews 5.0.The system \nestimation of the TVP-LR-LAIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS can be performed by the SAS 8.02 matrix \nprogramming language IML. \nApplications of LAIDS to Tourism Forecasting \nAlthough the LAIDS models have been employed widely in food demand modelling, applications in \nthe field of tourism demand are still limited. A detailed review of the LAIDS related to tourism can be \n  \n12 \nfound in Li et al (2005b). All of these LAIDS applications analysed allocations of tourists\u2019 expenditure \nin a group of destinations, with only one exception, Fujii et al (1985), who investigated tourists\u2019 \nexpenditure on different consumer goods in a particular destination. Most of the LAIDS studies in the \ntourism context adopted the original static version, while Durbarry and Sinclair (2003) and Li et al \n(2005a) specified the EC-LAIDS models to examine the dynamics of tourists\u2019 consumption behaviour. \nThe empirical study of Li et al (2005a) examined UK outbound tourism demand in Western Europe. \nThe five major destinations in this area, Spain, France, Greece, Italy and Portugal, are the focuses of \nthis study, with the other seventeen countries aggregated into a single group. Each of the six \ndestination countries\/group is regarded as an aggregated tourism product, purchased by UK visitors. \nThe empirical results show that tourism demand by UK residents is most sensitive to price changes in \nGreece and least sensitive to price changes in Italy.  The cross-price elasticities indicate that France \nand Spain,  Italy and Portugal, and France and Greece are likely to be substitutes in the minds of UK \ntourists. With regard to forecasting performance, the EC-LAIDS always outperforms the static LAIDS, \nand in general the EC-LAIDS is over 40% more accurate than the static LAIDS.  \n \nLi et al (2006a) further developed the TVP-LR-LAIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS to analyse the evolutions \nof demand elasticities over time and to examine their forecasting performance. Figure 1 shows the \nestimates of compensated own-price elasticities in the unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS models. These \ngraphs exhibit different evolution patterns of the price elasticity. Relatively large fluctuations which \noccurred in the early 1980s are associated with the global economic recession during this period. Since \nthe mid 1980s, the sensitivity of tourism demand for France, Greece and Italy to their price changes has \nbecome relatively stable, while the opposite phenomena can be observed in the cases of demand for \nPortugal and Spain tourism, with the influence of the Gulf War in the early 1990s being evident. As far \nas the forecasting performance is concerned, the unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS \noutperform all of the other fixed-parameter counterparts in the overall evaluation of demand level \nforecasts. It suggests that the more advanced forecasting techniques contribute to the improvements of \nforecasting accuracy, and therefore should be applied more broadly in future tourism studies.  \n  \n13 \n \n-1.3 \n-1.2 \n-1.1 \n-1.0 \n-0.9 \n-0.8 \n80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 00 \na.

The error correction mechanism and the TVP forecasting technique have been \nincorporated in both single-equation and system of equations (represented by LAIDS) frameworks. \nThe empirical evidence shows that more advanced forecasting methods are likely to generate more \naccurate forecasts of tourism demand. Further developments and applications of econometric \nforecasting approaches should be therefore encouraged.  \n \nIt should be noted that the above models are suitable where the annual tourism demand is concerned. \nIn other words, their model specifications accommodate annual data well, but do not consider the \nseasonal patterns of tourism demand. In practice, shorter-term forecasts, such as monthly or quarterly \nforecasts, are of more interests to tourism businesses in the private sector. It has been observed that the \nseasonality tended to be featured in short-term tourism demand in most destinations and tourism \nindustries. To meet the need for seasonal tourism forecasting, further developments of econometric \nforecasting methods should pay more attention to the seasonal patterns of tourism demand, and \nincorporate seasonal components in the TVP single-equation or TVP-LAIDS specifications. \nConsidering the merits of the TVP technique, the various seasonality-augmented TVP models are \nlikely to generate accurate forecasts of short-term demand for tourism.  \n  \n15 \nREFERENCES \nAnderson, G. and R.
