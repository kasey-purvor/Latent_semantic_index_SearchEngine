However, there are three substantive issues with this approach. First,\nit is problematic because it involves comparing different things; second, because by\nunderstanding the purpose of the analysis, it may be possible to justify the necessary\nsimplifications for special cases and limited applications while being explicit about the\nlimitations; and third (and conversely), this can expose errors and omissions in the analysis\neven after accepting its general principles.\nThe need for cost-benefit analysis is not about ignoring distinctions of quality and value\nand reducing things to a monetary value. It comes from the need to make decisions. In\nmaking a decision alternatives are ordered to enable selection, but these are not always\nequivalent to each other, which makes this problematic.\nICT (information and communication technology) research and development activities\ngenerally entail a trade-off between time, money and quality. Because budgets are fixed,\ndecision-making tends to weigh money over quality and timeliness, whereas decisions\nshould be made on appropriate educational factors. Is a model for evaluating the costs and\nbenefits of the use of ICT worthwhile? Yes, because it forces attention on the factors that\ndetermine educational outcomes.\nThe aim of the model is to calculate quantitatively in order to make decisions between\nalternatives. The actual but implicit benefit, it is argued, lies in identifying costs and\nbenefits and then measuring them. But the advantage of this approach is not actually\nquantitative (being able to make close decisions more accurately) but qualitative\n(identifying what the key issues are). Proponents argue that the use of their model lies in\nthe value and accuracy of the categories or factors used: however, if these do not\ncorrespond to sensible and useful divisions in the first place neither will results.\nFurthermore, their approach does lead to the generation of a list of important factors for\n118\nALT-J Volume \/ \/ Number 3\nusers of their model to consider applying. An aspect that could usefully be added would be\nto enable searching for important factors. After all, as they assert, this is one of the main\nbenefits of the approach.\nPessimism about the value of the quantitative aspect of this type of approach is reinforced\nby Landauer (1995). He argues that there is little evidence of the benefits of IT to the\nUnited States economy, except in a few special technical areas, which is in contrast to the\nkind of clear economic indicators of the benefits of other inventions. If nearly fifty years\nof IT investment in the USA do not show clear quantitative benefits, then the prospects of\nmeasuring these in an ICT project in one university seem remote.\nMy general view is that we need above all to understand the factors involved: we are far\nfrom identifying, let alone quantifying, these. CBA forces us to uncover and consider these\nfactors. Is their approach focused enough on this? I criticize their approach only for not\ngoing far enough.\nThe general problem with the accountancy categories used in their model is that they try to\nassign costs under headings, whereas given costs often produce benefits under several\nheadings. Thus the categories used for costs, far from being 'hard', are questionable. The\nmodel considers that costs are 'hard' measures (count the money) and benefits are 'soft',\ntherefore difficult to measure. But this fails to bring out the difficulty of inventing and\napplying categories that provide useful analysis. The model attempts to classify staff time\ninto either teaching or research, whereas in reality many activities contribute to both. We\ncan measure time (like money) accurately, but this should be assigned solely to either\nteaching or research. Similarly consider, for example, classifying the cost of a student\nlearning to use email. Is this a skill of benefit to their learning needs, relevant for future\nemployment or something of value to their social life? In reality it is valuable for all of these.\nThese examples bring out not only the inappropriateness of apparently obvious cost\ncategories, but also an issue not faced by Nicol and Coen: about how the same action can\nbe classified differently at different times. A student signing up for email training, or an\nacademic going to a conference will very often see the benefit differently before or after\ngoing or again at some time later. So too would an analyst, since more information about\nthe true beneficial consequences is available later; yet decisions have to be made on the\nbasis of advance information. Thus these measures are not objective or stable over time.\nFurthermore, it suggests that CBA done purely to support management decisions may be\nrather poor at understanding what the real benefits are, and therefore poor at developing\nunderstanding of education and at supporting management decisions in the longer term.\nOverall there are three problems with the approach adopted. First, accountancy is about\napplying categories that are general and fixed (for example, by tax or laws governing\naccounts for public companies): these legal requirements in turn stem from forcing\ncompanies to apply the same categories in order to allow investors to compare (unlike)\ncompanies. Because of the primitive state of CBA of education, we should build cautiously\nfrom small cases, embracing new categories as appropriate and acknowledging the\ndeficiencies and time limitations of each. Generalization may only become possible later.\nInstead the focus should be on identifying the usefulness of each category at a given time.\nThe preference for standard categories, so important in accountancy, is a liability in an\neducational context.\n119\nSteve Draper The importance of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) - a response\nSecond, though they say the paper comes from trying to combine an accountant's\napproach to costs with an educational evaluator's approach to benefits, in fact the\naccountant too is identifying benefits not costs. It is not difficult to measure how much\nmoney has been spent: the difficulty is in identifying what benefits have been bought by it.\nCategories such as research vs teaching, perhaps even infrastructure vs value-added\nactivity, are categories of benefit bought by money.\nThird, money is the only cost (in the sense of negative benefit or limited resource) being\nanalysed in their model. If accountants can only measure money, then other cost experts\nmust be brought in to identify and measure the other costs such as staff stress (soon to\nbecome a legal liability to organizations), and student time (not paid for, yet a fixed and\nlimited resource, around which the organization's business is structured).\nMy final point considers the issue of learning costs, which is paramount as ICT projects\noften fail to become embedded; the costs of addressing associated staff development needs\nwere not included. In addition, learning costs are particularly tricky because they change\nover time. In the USA, there is now an assumption that most students have a basic\nfamiliarity with computers. This means that training in basic computer literacy has moved\nto being a remedial activity for a minority. Learning costs are crucial to analyse because\nthey have a major effect on when a given project may become worthwhile; which disciplines\nit will and will not work for; and economies of scale: it may work only for large-scale\nchange where a single learning cost gives benefits on repeated occasions.\nThere is no space for more detailed discussion: I have concentrated on the main issues. To\nsupport decision-making and so to do anything of practical usefulness to learners, we must\nbe able to reduce all alternatives to a single order of preference. This does not necessarily\nrequire expressing their merits in terms of money or any other numerical score; but it does\nrequire comparing qualitatively unlike things. Nicol and Coen are tackling one of the most\nimportant issues in the education field and one with enormous potential benefits to\nlearners. However the benefits may be a long way off, because the difficulties are\nsubstantial. I thus fully endorse their overall aim, but is progress possible? We need to\nuncover the associated factors and issues. Their method should be modified to stress an\nopen-ended enquiry phase of active search for the important factors in each case and\nlearning costs should be included in the classification. Furthermore it is important to\nconsider whether the model can reason about the cost-time-(learning) quality triangle that\nimplicitly dominates most practical educational decision-making in both research projects\nand daily practice; or alternatively if you follow Phillips (1996) and Reeves (1992) then you\nwill require it to reason about the quantity-quality-cost trade off.\nA longer version of this commentary is available at: http:\/\/www.psy.gla.ac.ukhstevelqqa.html\nReferences\nNicol, D. and Coen, M.
