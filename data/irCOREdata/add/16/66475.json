INTRODUCTION\nExciton-light interactions have been a subject of growing\ninterest since the 1950s, when the concept of exciton polari-\ntons was originally formulated by Hopfeld1 and Agranovich.2\nAn exciton polariton is a quasiparticle combining the prop-\nerties of an electronic excitation and a light wave. Exciton\npolaritons can play a major role in the low-temperature op-\ntical properties of semiconductor structures and exhibit a re-\nmarkable variety of properties that are mostly dependent on\nthe dimensionality of the system.\nBulk exciton polaritons have been studied experimentally\nin semiconductor films since the 1970s ~see, e.g., Refs. 3 and\n4!. The epoch of quantum wells ~QWs! started in the 1980s\nand revealed the crucial influence on the properties of exci-\nton polaritons of the dimensionality of the excitonic state that\nwas coupled to the light. The semiclassical theory of exciton\npolaritons in QWs and superlattices was developed by a\nnumber of workers, including Andreani et al.5 and\nIvchenko.6 At the beginning of the 1990s, the rapid develop-\nment of molecular-beam epitaxy allowed further reduction of\nthe dimensionality of both the exciton and photon states\nforming the exciton polaritons. High-quality quantum wire\nand quantum dot ~QD! structures are now widely studied by\ndifferent experimental techniques, including time-resolved\noptical spectroscopy, which can give information on the ki-\nnetics of exciton polaritons in these structures.7,8 The basic\nprinciples of the semiclassical description of these systems\nhave been formulated9,10 and are currently being applied to\npredict the behavior of structures of topical interest.\nSince the first report of the strong coupling in quantum\nmicrocavities by Weisbuch et al.,11 a huge number of papers\ndevoted to exciton polaritons in planar microcavities have\nappeared. Strong enhancement of the light-matter coupling\nstrength in these structures has been demonstrated, both ex-\nperimentally and theoretically ~e.g., Ref. 12 and references\ntherein!. A further decrease of the dimensionality of the pho-\ntonic state coupled to the exciton is possible in pillar\nmicrocavities13,14 and spherical Bragg microcavities.15 Re-\ncent progress in photonic crystal fabrication gives hope that\nthe four-decade-long progression to lower dimensionality in\nexciton-polariton systems will soon achieve its logical con-\nclusion with the appearance of photonic dots with embedded\nelectronic quantum dots. In particular, technological ad-\nvances in the fabrication of spherical objects by the tech-\nniques of colloidal chemistry,16,17 and other methods18 will\nhopefully provide a means for the practical fabrication of\nmultilayered structures of spherical symmetry in due course.\nA rigorous theoretical analysis of an ideal system that\nexhibits coupling of zero-dimensional photons with zero-\ndimensional excitons seems timely.\nWe consider an ideal spherical QD embedded in an ideal\nspherical microcavity ~SMC!, as shown in Fig. 1, and we use\nthe Green-function approach for quantum dots proposed by\nBanyai and Koch.10 The fact that it is possible to obtain an\nanalytical solution of the polariton eigenmode equation\nmakes this model system especially attractive for a theoreti-\ncal study.\nThe essential difference between our model system and\nthat considered by Andreani et al.14 is that we restrict our\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B, VOLUME 64, 115305\n0163-1829\/2001\/64~11!\/115305~9!\/$20.00 \u00a92001 The American Physical Society64 115305-1\nattention to a system having a spherical symmetry, rather\nthan one of cylindrical symmetry.14 As will be shown below,\nthese two cases show quite important differences in behavior.\nWe also demonstrate the distinctive features of zero-\ndimensional ~spherical! exciton polaritons compared to con-\nventional polaritons formed by plane light waves.\nII. BASIC EQUATIONS\nA. Reflection of the spherical light wave by a quantum dot\nA spherical electromagnetic wave can be represented as a\nsuperposition of two waves with decoupled polarizations:19 a\nTE wave with components Hr ,Eu ,Ef ,Hu ,Hf , and a TM\nwave with components Er ,Eu ,Ef ,Hu ,Hf . Here E and H\ndenote the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The spa-\ntial dependence of the electric and magnetic fields in a\nspherical wave can be expressed in terms of spherical har-\nmonics characterized by a positive integer l and an integer m\nin the interval from 2l to l, which are related to the angular\norbital momentum and its projection. The value l50 corre-\nsponds to a fully spherically symmetric electromagnetic\nwave, which does not exist for nonzero frequency.15,19 In the\ncase of the TE polarization, the spherical wave field with\nfrequency v in a medium with dielectric constant \u00ab can be\nwritten as\nEW l ,m52mk0S msin u Plumu~cos u!eW u1i ]]u Plumu~cos u!eWfD\n3V~r !exp~ imf!, ~1a!\nHW l ,m5H l~ l11 !r j l~kr !Plumu~cos u!eW r1S ]]u Plumu~cos u!eW u\n1\nim\nsin u Pl\numu~cos u!eWfD 1r ]]r @rV~r !#J exp~ imf!,\n~1b!\nwhere V(r)5Ahl(1)(kr)1Bhl(2)(kr), A and B are constants,\nk5A\u00abv\/c , and the spherical functions hl\n(1)(x) and hl(2)(x)\nare related to the Hankel functions by hl\n(1,2)(x)\n5Ap\/2xHl11\/2\n(1,2) (x). Plumu(cos u) is an associated Legendre\nfunction.\nSimilarly, for the TM eigenmodes\nHW l ,m5\u00abk0S msin u Plumu~cos u!eW u\n1i\n]\n]u\nPl\numu~cos u!eWfDV~r !exp~ imf!, ~2a!\nEW l ,m5H l~ l11 !r j l~kr !Plumu~cos u!eW r1S ]]u Plumu~cos u!eW u\n1\nim\nsin u Pl\numu~cos u!eWfD 1r ]]r @rV~r !#J exp~ imf!.\n~2b!\nAn electromagnetic field in the central core of the microcav-\nity can be represented as the sum of incoming and outgoing\nwaves. The field at the center of the microcavity should be\nfinite, and this requires, in the case of the empty microcavity,\nthat the incoming and outgoing waves have equal amplitude\nin the central core and the radial dependence of the field be\ndescribed by the spherical Bessel function j l5@hl(1)(x)\n1hl\n(2)(x)#\/2. Thus, the electromagnetic field of each eigen-\nmode is described by Eqs. ~1! and ~2! with V(r)5 j l(kr).\nOnly in the case of the TM mode with l51 is the electric\nfield of the eigenmode not equal to zero at the center of the\nSMC. Hence, only with this mode is there significant inter-\naction with a ~nonmagnetic! quantum dot placed at the center\nof the microcavity. For all other cavity modes, the electric\nfield at the center of the SMC vanishes, and there is negli-\ngible interaction with a QD placed there.\nThe electric field of the TM eigenmode of an empty SMC,\ncharacterized by l51, m50, has the form\nEW hom5\n2\nr\nj1~kr !cos~u!eW r2\n1\nr\nd\ndr @r j1~kr !#sin ueW u . ~3!\nUsing the matrix M\u02c6 ,\nM\u02c6 5S sin u cos f cos u cos f 2sin fsin u sin f cos u sin f cos f\ncos u sin u 0\nD ~4!\nfor the transformation from spherical to Cartesian coordi-\nnates, we can represent the electric field in the form\nFIG. 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSONS\nFigure 3 shows the spectral dependence of the absorption\ncoefficient for a spherical electromagnetic wave with l51\nincident on a quantum dot with different values of the non-\nradiative damping G . Note that in the case G50, the magni-\ntude of the absorption coefficient is zero, which is quite natu-\nral since in this case there is no dissipation of energy. The\nmagnitude of the diverging wave is the same as the magni-\ntude of the converging wave in this case, while its initial\nphase is modified according to Eqs. ~42! and ~43!. As G\nincreases, the peak value of the absorption coefficient, which\ncorresponds to the exciton resonance frequency v5vex , in-\ncreases and reaches unity when the nonradiative and radia-\ntive damping are equal (G5G0), as shown in the inset in\nFig. 3. Further increase of G leads to a decrease of the peak\nvalue of the absorption coefficient and a broadening of the\nabsorption line. Similar behavior has been found recently in\nthe case of a cylindrical light wave incident on a quantum\nwire.22 The latter can be understood by taking into account\nthe fact that the systems have either a point or line where the\nconverging wave diverges ~and vice versa!.\nThe interaction between localized exciton and photon\nmodes has two different regimes, namely the strong-coupling\nregime, which holds when the splitting of the modes exceeds\nthe half-sum of their damping parameters and two peaks can\nbe distinguished in the absorption spectrum, and the weak-\ncoupling regime, which holds when the half-sum of the\ndamping parameters exceeds the splitting and the two peaks\nin the absorption spectra merge into one. In the case of a\nrealistic quantum well or quantum wire exciton, the nonradi-\native damping of the exciton is usually much larger than the\nradiative one. This is because the acoustic phonon scattering\nof excitons is quite efficient within continuous energy bands.\nIn contrast, quantum dots possess a discrete energy spectrum.\nTherefore, the nonradiative damping of a quantum dot exci-\nton is very small, and comparable with the radiative\ndamping.23 Experimentally, the emission linewidth of a\nquantum dot exciton is difficult to measure directly, often\nbeing less than the spectral resolution of the current\nequipment.24 Therefore, the lifetime of the zero-dimensional\npolariton in this case is governed by the quality factor (Q\nfactor! of the spherical Bragg microcavity.\nFigure 4 shows the absorption spectra, calculated using\nthe transfer matrix method, of a SMC formed by a central\ncore of refractive index 2.7 and a seven-period spherical\nBragg reflector, with layers of refractive indices 1.45 and 2.7.\nResults for different values of the central core radius are\nshown. The refractive indices correspond to those for ZnTe\nand SiO2, which are the materials whose layers can be de-\nposited by means of colloidal chemistry.16,17.

Increasing the central core radius\nreduces the frequency of the eigenmode of the empty cavity.\nWhen a cavity mode is detuned from the exciton resonance,\nthe spectrum exhibits a well pronounced peak, corresponding\nto an excitonic transition and a small peak corresponding to\nthe uncoupled cavity mode @see the curves of Figs. 4~a! and\n4~e!#. Tuning the optical mode towards the exciton resonance\nleads to a shift of both peaks, which exhibit identical shapes\nin the case of precise tuning @Fig. 4~c!#. The splitting of the\ncavity mode corresponds to the value of the vacuum Rabi\nsplitting D given by Eq. ~48!. This behavior of the absorption\nspectrum as a function of detuning is a signature of the\nstrong-coupling regime. The first theoretical proof of the\npossibility of strong coupling of quantum dot excitons with\ncavity photons has been given by Andreani et al.14 The\npresent analysis of the eigenmodes of a spherical microcav-\nity confirms those predictions.\nDecreasing the number of layers in the Bragg reflector of\nthe cavity reduces the Q factor of the cavity and leads to a\nbroadening of the cavity mode. Figure 5 shows the absorp-\ntion spectra of the SMC with a QD and a reflector consisting\nof five pairs of layers. In this case, the width of the cavity\nmode exceeds the splitting. When the cavity mode is detuned\nfrom the exciton resonance, the absorption peak is asymmet-\nric. Tuning the cavity mode towards the exciton resonance\nleads to a shift and broadening of the peak as shown in Fig.\n6, but the camelback structure does not appear. In the case of\nprecise tuning, the position of the peak in the absorption\nspectrum corresponds to the exciton resonance frequency,\nwhile its width corresponds to the value of Rabi splitting.\nThese spectral features are typical of the weak-coupling re-\ngime. Excitons in single quantum dots are subject to the\nFermi exclusion principle, and thus only two optically active\nexcitons are allowed in each quantum confined state. Never-\ntheless, the excitonic transition in a QD has enough oscillator\nstrength to exhibit strong coupling with a spherical cavity\nmode, as we have shown here.\nOne can see that in zero-dimensional microcavities with\nquantum dots, the vacuum field Rabi splitting has essentially\nthe same order of magnitude as in one-dimensional cavities\nwith quantum wires and two-dimensional cavities with quan-\ntum wells. Thus, the coupling constant of the exciton to the\ncavity photon is only weakly influenced by the dimensional-\nity. On the other hand, the threshold to the nonlinear regime\ntakes place at drastically different pumping intensities in the\nsystems of different dimensionalities. In quantum wells, the\nFIG. 4.

On the other hand, in a zero-dimensional microcavity\nwith a single quantum dot, the creation of only two electron-\nhole pairs causes already the nonlinear phenomena, and the\nbiexciton can be formed. This peculiar behavior could have a\nsubstantial influence on the optical properties of\nmicrocavities.25 In particular, this effect could lead to the\nsublinear dependence of the intensity of light emission from\na microcavity in a zero-dimensional case.\nFinally, we should point out that by varying the param-\neters of the system, we can change the splitting of the zero-\ndimensional polariton states. Thus, a SMC with a QD pro-\nvides an opportunity for quantum state engineering, which\ncould be interesting from the point of view of the experimen-\ntal implementation of a quantum computer.26\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe interaction of zero-dimensional excitons and photons\nhas been analyzed theoretically using the theory of nonlocal\ndielectric response and the transfer matrix method. Light ab-\nsorption by a single quantum dot has been analyzed and it is\nshown that the resonant excitonic absorption of the l\n51 TM spherical wave incident on the quantum dot is total\nwhen the nonradiative and radiative damping factors of the\nexciton are equal. An equation for the eigenenergies and an\nexpression for the value of the vacuum Rabi splitting for the\nzero-dimensional polariton have also been obtained. Absorp-\ntion spectra for a specific type of structure have been ob-\ntained and the transition between the strong- and weak-\ncoupling regime has been illustrated.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was partly funded by EPSRC research Grant\nGL\/R 73258 and 73159, by European Commission, project\nIST-1999-19009 PHOBOS, and partly by INTAS 928 and\nRFBR.
