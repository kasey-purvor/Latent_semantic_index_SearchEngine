Although contact centres are efficient\nin cost saving terms and in that they allow customers access to organisations at times, and\nthrough contact methods, that are suitable to the them, there are issues with their effectiveness.\nThe use of contact centres is not just apparent in the private sector but their use is also prevalent\nin the public and third sector organisations (i.e. charities) (DTI, 2004). Historically, contact\ncentres were initially set up in order to take advantage of economies of scale and utilise the\ndevelopments in information and communication technology (ICT), the primary motivation for\nthis was cost rationalisation (Anton, 2000). This focus on cost reduction has led to contact\ncentres adopting a mass production approach to service provision. Consequently contact centres\nreceive a grim representation in literature with some authors regarding them as akin to the\nsweatshops and factories of the past (e.g. Fernie and Metcalf, 1998). They are regularly depicted\nas unattractive places to work which provide substandard levels of service to disgruntled\ncustomers and are often referred to as \u2018an assembly line in the head\u2019(Taylor and Bain, 1999).\nMany of the techniques employed in contact centres originate from manufacturing\u2019s past with\nsome contact centre scholars drawing parallels with factory environments and Taylorism (Bain\nand Taylor, 2000; Bain et al., 2002; Batt and Moynihan, 2002; Calvert, 2004) but little of the\nexisting research focuses on how contact centres can learn from manufacturing\u2019s future. In order\nto overcome this limitation in existing research, the research presented in this paper discusses\n8current issues with the contact centre operating model and examines if these can be overcome by\nlearning from developments in manufacturing.\nFigure 1 shows the conceptual framework that is driving this research.\nFigure 1 \u2013 Conceptual framework\nAs Figure 1 shows there has been organisational learning occurring across the organisational\ndivide between manufacturing and contact centres, primarily between the mass approaches, but\nthis research is interested in understanding if the organisational learning from manufacturing can\nstill be used for developing the emerging contact centre model. Therefore, the research question\n(RQ) driving this research is:\nRQ: Can the mass production model of contact centres be improved by adopting methods\nthat have moved manufacturing from mass to modern manufacturing? Or do they diverge\nand follow another path?\n9Figure 1 shows the development of manufacturing as three distinct phases, these are the craft\nphase, the mass manufacturing phase and the modern phase (Mair, 1993). In the craft phase\nproducts were made by skilled craftsmen who focused on low volume production on a small\nscale where the focus was on satisfying the customer and the quality of the product. The advent\nof mechanisation and the industrial revolution meant that manufacturing was considered on a\nlarge scale in a mass manufacturing model. In this production model products were\nmanufactured in high volumes but with a low variety of the types of products. A number of key\ntheories were behind the development of this production model such as, the introduction of\nscientific management principles, the use of standardised and interchangeable parts and the\nmoving assembly line. The main focus of this production model is productivity improvement.\nThe third phase, the modern phase, the focus has shifted due to highly fragmented markets, the\nreduction in product lifecycles and the demand from consumers for more choice in the products\nthey are purchasing. This modern manufacturing phase is characterised by concepts such as\nflexible specialisation (Piore and Sabel, 1984), lean production (Womack et al., 1990), mass\ncustomisation (Pine et al., 1993) and agile manufacturing (Kidd, 1994).\nAlthough modern manufacturing techniques have their foundations in the work of scientific\nmanagement and mass production techniques (Schmenner, 2001) the sector has improved\nthrough the adoption of operations management techniques to allow increases in productivity,\nproduct quality and employee satisfaction. The dominance of the mass production contact centre\nmodel shows that contact centres lag behind developments in manufacturing operations\nmanagement. This could be due to contact centres being a relatively young concept, with the\n10\nbusiness model of contact centres only being widely used since the 1980\u2019s, meaning that the\nindustry is currently approximately 30 years old. Nevertheless, the industry is still adopting\nmanagement techniques that have their roots in 1800\u2019s in manufacturing.\nIn order to understand if contact centres can overcome their issues by learning from\nmanufacturing, the current operational issues facing contact centres need to be examined and\ncompared against what techniques, theories and methodologies manufacturing utilises.\nAPPROACH\nThe methodological approach that this study takes is an exploratory case study approach. Case\nstudies allow complex relationships to be understood and also have the benefit of the research\nbeing carried out in the natural setting of the organisation, meaning that the situation is not\nartificially created. In theory this should result in observations that are a true representation of\nthe case company that is under investigation (Yin, 2003). This is important when examining\nissues concerning a specific type of organisation. In order to get a representative view of the\ncontact centre industry a selection of different types of contact centre were selected for the study\nto reflect the wide and varied nature of the contact centre industry. Table 1 illustrates the\nselection of large and small size centres as well as centres that deal with simple services and ones\nthe service complex enquires.\n11\nTable 1 \u2013 Composition of case companies\nCase\nCompany\nDirection of\ncontact\nCustomers Nature of services Size Ownership Sector\nCentre A Inbound Consumer Complex customer\nservices\nSmall Outsourced Public\nCentre B Inbound Consumer Simple customer\nservices\nLarge In-house Public\nCentre C Inbound &\nOutbound\nBusiness Complex technical\nhelpdesk\nLarge In-house Private\nCentre D Outbound Consumer Simple customer\nservices\nSmall In-house Public\nCentre E Inbound &\nOutbound\nConsumer &\nBusiness\nComplex technical\nhelpdesk\nLarge In-house Private\nSimple sales\nCentre F Inbound Consumer &\nBusiness\nSimple customer\nservices\nLarge In-house Private\nCentre G Inbound Consumer Simple customer\nservice\nLarge In-house Private\nCentre H Inbound Consumer Simple customer\nservice\nLarge In-house Private\nGiven the exploratory nature of this research, interview and direct observation were the chosen\nmethods for data collection. The methods provided commonality of data collection across the\ncases with flexibility to explore issues that were important in the particular context. Notes were\ntaken during the interviews along with audio recordings. These notes were combined with notes\nfrom direct observation of contact centre activity and compiled into case study notes.\nThe purpose of this research is to identify common themes across the cases and not on\nidentifying the differences between the cases. The analysis used a coding technique where the\ndata was coded in NVivo using a combination of deductive codes and emergent codes that\ndeveloped as the analysis was performed. The deductive codes were taken from Tompkins et al.\n12\n(1996) areas of description which they used to characterise each phase of manufacturing\ndevelopment. The Tompkins et al. (1996) categories were selected to ease the comparison\nbetween contact centres and manufacturing. As the primary data collected in this study is only\nfrom contact centres and not from manufacturing, the comparison to manufacturing will be based\non manufacturing literature.\nThe deductive codes are:\n\uf0b7 Management and organisation\n\uf0b7 People development\n\uf0b7 Operations capability and automation\n\uf0b7 Operations focus\n\uf0b7 Improvement approaches\n\uf0b7 External relationships and interaction\nIn cases where the deductive codes could not be used to properly classify the data then an\nemergent code was created. In the case of this research the only emergent code that developed\nwas \u2018performance management\u2019. For example if the interviewee said \u201cagents get [pressure] to\nmake sure they are meeting their productivity targets\u201d then this would be coded as performance\nmanagement. This type of analysis followed an iterative process of coding to ensure that the\ncodes were robust and that data was coded correctly.\nThe next stage in the analysis was to identify common themes and characteristics within each of\nthe codes. The themes that were common across four or more cases were identified as important\n13\nissues that have implication on the operations management of contact centres. Table 2 shows the\nfindings from the contact centre case studies.\nTable 2 \u2013 Findings from contact centre cases\nArea Issues identified from case data Case where evident\nPerformance\nmanagement\n\uf0b7 Individual agent volume based metrics\n\uf0b7 Productivity based targets\nB, C, D, E, G, H\nB, C, D, E, F, G, H\nManagement\nand\norganisation\n\uf0b7 Electronic surveillance by management\n\uf0b7 Employee involvement team\n\uf0b7 Teams are used to stimulate competition between\nareas of the centre\nA, B, C, E, F, G\nA, B, E, G, H\nB, E, F, G\nPeople\ndevelopment\n\uf0b7 Training is mainly focused on the usage of IT\nsystems and processes\n\uf0b7 Agents are not given time off phone for other\nactivities\n\uf0b7 Job design is restricted with no or little job rotation\nor enrichment\nA, B, C, E, F, G, H\nB, C, E, F\nB, C, D, E, F, G\nOperations\ncapability and\nautomation\n\uf0b7 Service is based on a mass production approach\n\uf0b7 Processes are governed by the IT system\n\uf0b7 Automation is used for contact avoidance\nB, E, F, G\nA, B, C, E, F, G, H\nA, B, F, G\nOperations\nfocus\n\uf0b7 Focus is on processing numbers and not on resolving\ncustomers needs\n\uf0b7 Focus is agent utilisation\nB, E, F, G\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\nImprovement\napproaches\n\uf0b7 There is little continuous improvement and no focus\non innovation\n\uf0b7 Improvement focus is on cost reduction and\nincreasing productivity\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\nA, B, C, E, F, G\nExternal\nrelationships\nand interaction\n\uf0b7 Adverse relationship with customers and employees\n\uf0b7 Limited contact with external organisations\nB, E, F, G\nB, C, D, E, F, G\nIn order to understand if these issues can be addressed by developments adopted from\nmanufacturing it is necessary to identify how manufacturing has developed in each of the\noperational areas.

As was discussed\npreviously the only emergent code developing from the data was \u2018performance\nmanagement\u2019 and the discussion starts with this area.\nDISCUSSION\nThe discussion takes each area in turn and discusses the issues in contact centres and\ncompares how manufacturing has addressed these issues.\nPerformance management\nThe issues identified from the contact centre cases concerning performance management\nare focused on individual agent volume based metrics and productivity based targets.\nPerformance management in contact centres has received much attention from academics\nprimarily focusing on how to implement service quality measures into the contact centre\nenvironment (Gilmore, 2001; Bain et al., 2002; Clarkson and Hodgkinson, 2005). While\nsome scholars working in the manufacturing field have started to look at the performance\nmeasurement issue in contact centres from a more balanced view (e.g. Marr and Neely,\n2004).\n17\nAlmost all of the cases in this study had targets and metrics based on call handling levels\nto which each individual agent had to make their targets. In case F agents\u2019 names were\ndisplayed in the work area with their current performance and adherence to the targets\npresented for all the team to see. The thinking behind this is to identify the agents who\nare not performing to the targets.\nThis metrics driven performance culture is also echoed in cases A and E. In case E one\nteam leader said that \u201cagents are heavily measured \u2013 performance improvement plans put\nin place if agents are not meeting their targets \u2013 team leaders have the responsibility to\nmanage this problem.\u201d Again this quote shows that performance is based on agents\nmeeting their targets. In this case the targets were based on the number of customers\nserviced in a day. While day based targets were common across the cases there was\nevidence from case F which showed that some contact centres used tally sheets to\nmeasure how many customers were dealt with in an hour period. In case F agents used a\ntemplate sheet which said \u201canswering 8 per hour makes our customers happy\u201d on the top\nof the sheet and the agents had to tick a box when they finished a call.\nThe other issue with performance measures was that meeting the predefined targets often\nlead to a reward. One agent in Case A said that \u201cthere are other incentive and rewards\nschemes \u2026 but these are linked to performance, and high performing employees can\nbecome agents of the month.\u201d The use of rewards and performance related bonuses is\ncommon across many of the cases in this study.\n18\nPerformance management is a major field in manufacturing research and to overcome the\nissues faced by the mass production approach, where quantity was the key metric,\nmanufacturing scholars have developed a more holistic approach to performance. The\nbalanced scorecard (Kaplan and Norton, 1996) and the performance prism (Neely et al.,\n2001) have been major developments in the performance management of manufacturing\n(although both approaches have a wider scope than manufacturing) therefore contact\ncentres could attempt to have a more balanced approach to performance, focusing on\nquality and employees as well as productivity measures.\nFrom investigating the contact centre literature it would seem that both performance\nmanagement and contact centre scholars are working towards the more balanced view of\nperformance management that is apparent in manufacturing. However, the empirical\nevidence collected in this study implies that the focus is still on productivity measures.\nManagement and organisation\nThe main issues identified from the cases concerning management and organisation\nfocused on the use of electronic surveillance by management. All cases, apart from case\nD who were considering the implementation of call listening equipment at the time of the\nstudy, used electronic recordings to monitor the calls and the way the agents dealt with\nthe customer. This technology is used without the knowledge of the agent, they are\n19\nunaware of what calls their manager will listen to. This is to ensure adherence to quality\nlevels or any scripts that might be used to deal with customer.\nWhile call listening and monitoring was common throughout the cases, there were\nexamples (primarily case F) of the electronic control where agents\u2019 breaks were\nscheduled by the computer system and the agent was monitored on their adherence to the\nsystem. This is also true of the management knowing when agents are free to take calls,\nagents do not have control over the volume of calls they handle, this is also controlled by\nthe computer system which will route calls to an agent as soon as they are finished the\nother call. This is demonstrated by an agent from case G who said \u201cwe\u2019ve got like a\nproductivity target [of] 83% so you\u2019ve got to \u2026 to take calls on the phone \u2026 so if you\u2019ve\ngot a customer who you\u2019re doing something in their file but you don\u2019t want to keep them\non the phone because you don\u2019t want them ending up irate \u2026 if you let them got you\ncan\u2019t take another call \u2026 because you\u2019d be in the [first] person\u2019s file \u2026 and then all\nyou\u2019ll hear is \u201cget on the phone, get on the phone\u201d but you can\u2019t because you\u2019re doing\nsomething.\u201dThis quote shows that the agent is still trying to do work for the customer but\nas their manager can see that they are not taking calls they pressure the agent to take more\ncalls.\nSome research has taken place into the effects this remote electronic surveillance has on\ncontact centre agents (Garson, 1988; Bain and Taylor, 2000). The Bain and Taylor\n(2000) study actually looks at how agents are finding ways to resist the \u2018electronic\npanopticon\u2019, which is how they describe this type of surveillance. This electronic\n20\nmonitoring and remote control can result in a culture where the agents feel that they are\nnot trusted by management. While manufacturing did not have electronic surveillance, in\nthe same way that contact centre do, it did suffer from staff feeling untrustworthy by\nmanagement. Hay (2002) has shown that the dynamic of trust develops in manufacturing\norganisations as initiatives such as just-in-time manufacture and team based working are\nimplemented. Therefore, contact centres have the opportunity to learn from the advances\nin operator\/management relationship development from manufacturing. There is\nhowever still an issue with team based working in contact centres.\nTable 3, we shows that future manufacturing will have self-managed teams; while the\ncontact centres in this study did use teams most of them used teams to stimulate\ncompetition between areas of the centre. In cases B, F and G teams were given names\n(for example, in case G the teams are named after football team and they have a league\ntable to show how the teams are performing hour by hour) the teams are normally\nperforming the same tasks and so are in direct competition with each other. In case E the\nteam leader said \u201cteams do compete against each other \u2013 incentives are put in place\nevery quarter from top management for team leaders to compete and this goes down to\nthe agent level \u2013 reward could be a day off or a day out with the company paying.\u201d\nTeams in contact centres are often down to organising agents into manageable numbers\nand nothing to do with the interaction between team members.\nThe nature of contact centre work means that agents are working on their own on a one-\nto-one basis with the customer, which means interaction with other team members can be\n21\nlimited for example; a team leader from case B said \u201cIt is hard for agents to interact with\neach other this is due to the nature of the job\u201d.\nIf contact centres were to move to self-managed teams the concept of \u2018team\u2019 would need\nto be addressed in the contact centre context as well as the issue with trust. This might\nresult in the whole idea of a contact centre job being redesigned and the service model\nbeing reconsidered.\nTompkins et al. (1996) in Table 3 say that employee involvement teams are part of\nfocused and coordinated product and process improvements in current manufacturing.\nFrom the contact centre case studies it can be witnessed that many of the cases did have\nsome level of employee involvement or participation groups. For example, case A has a\nstaff representation group \u201cwe have a group called the *** group \u2013 staff representation\nand managers go into it and meet fortnightly \u2013 put forward ideas, concerns and\nsuggestions about the business as a whole\u201d in this case the company have this group so\nthat management can stop any issues escalating to major problems. Where as in case B\nthey have a staff ideas scheme which encourages agents to get involved in improvement\nactivities, the improvement manager said that \u201cstaff ideas scheme works because the staff\nwant to be involved in something more exciting than their day-to-day jobs.\u201d\nContact centres often place a lot of emphasis on staff wellbeing such as in case A, B, G\nand H which have free fruit or food on certain days of the week or month, this is due to\nthe high rates of attrition in the industry (Wallace et al., 2001). Some researchers are\ninvestigating the effect of contact centre work on employee wellbeing (Holman, 2002),\n22\nsickness (Taylor et al., 2003) and stress levels (Grandey et al., 2004; Holman, 2004). It\nwould seem from the evidence in both the contact centre literature and from the evidence\nfrom the primary data that contact centres have a well developed attitude to employee\ninvolvement and participation.\nPeople development\nOne of the issues identified from the contact centre cases was that training is mainly\nfocused on the usage of IT systems and processes and is normally \u2018on the job\u2019 training as\ncan be seen from the training manager from case B who said that \u201cagents received 2 days\ntraining with the company (not on phones), 1 week \u2018buddy\u2019 training and then 5 weeks and\n3 days on the job training\u201d. The same training manager also highlights the performance\nculture, discussed previously, existing in contact centres as they say that \u201ctraining is\nmaking direct links with performance data \u2013 to show that training has an impact on\ncontact centre performance\u201d. This highlights that the role of training in contact centres is\nagain to boost contact centre performance rather than for people development. The trust\nand productivity issues again are seen in case B by the training manager highlighting that\n\u201cteam leaders thought training was just time off telephones.\u201d\nOne of the reasons for the limited focus on training in contact centres could be that\nmanagement are reluctant to give agents time off the phones for other activities. This is\ndemonstrated by the team leader from case E saying that \u201ca lot of guys on the frontline\nwouldn\u2019t have time to do the projects as they get a lot of hassle to make sure they are\n23\nmeeting their productivity targets\u201d this relates to the time they are available to take calls,\nso once again the nature of the job restricts agents from being involved in projects and\ntraining that could help them develop.\nThis leads on to the third people development issue in contact centres which is that job\ndesign is restricted with no or little job rotation or enrichment. In Table 3 Tompkins et al.\n(1996) highlight that manufacturing currently has cross-trained workforces with job\nrotation which is achieved through extensive education and training. However, at present\ncontact centre work is still based on specialisation of tasks, with only case A attempting\nany type of job rotation. However case A has had issues in implementing this new form\nof working as this quote demonstrates \u201cwe try to get to a true blended environment \u2013\ngone through cross-skilling to get to this environment \u2013 blending has been put in but\nagents have had problems with it, they have become demoralised and we have lost agents\ndue to it \u2013 so we have listened to our employees and stopped this process of blending \u2013\nnow have chunks of work where agents will do phones for 2 hours and then do 2 hours of\ne-mail \u2013 new agents will be put into place they won\u2019t know any different environment.\u201d\nWhile job rotation and enrichment could provide substantial benefits for contact centres\nthere will be issues of culture and it would require a substantial change in the processes\nand systems of the contact centre.\n24\nOperations capability and automation\nOne of the issues with operations capability in contact centres is that their processes are\ngoverned by the IT system and due to the flexible nature of IT these processes can be\nchanged rapidly. For example in case G processes can be changed in a matter of hours\nbut as one of the business information managers said \u201cwe can make changes to the\nprocess very quickly but sometimes you don\u2019t know what changes other people have\nmade, so the process becomes very messy.\u201d This is very different to manufacturing\nwhere any changes in the production process would often require substantial effort from a\nvariety of people. In this case contact centres could take a more structured approach to\nprocess changes and development so that the process is working at the optimal level and\nthat everyone knows how the end-to-end process operates.\nFlexible automation has allowed greater flexibility in manufacturing (Adler, 1988), due to\nthe dynamic nature of contact centre environments there is a need for more flexibility in\nthe automation used. Case A in this study did have highly flexible automation in that\ntheir recorded messages were change depending on the demand created by the wider\norganisation which was rather dynamic. The technology development manager discussed\ntheir Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology at case B also said that \u201cIVR\u2019s are\nused for high volume services and are provided by an external provider. High volume\ndrives IVR\u2019s and automation \u2013 we have to mange customers expectations. There is lots of\ninformation through the internet \u2013 to encourage customers to self-serve\u201d. The issue with\nthe future of contact centres is that self-service (i.e. automation which is aimed at call\navoidance) can often drive more complex problems which customers will contact the\n25\ncentre with. Therefore, the automated systems need to be responsive to changes\nprompted by customers\u2019 needs as well as the external environment.\nOperations focus\nThe issue identified from the primary data is that contact centres have a focus on\nprocessing numbers, through high levels of agent utilisation, and not on resolving\ncustomers\u2019 needs. Some of the cases did say they considered quality of the calls as well\nas quantity as seen by the team leader for case C \u201cwe do have scripting in this area of the\ncontact centre but we are interested in quality as well as the quantity of the calls.\u201d\nHowever, as was discussed previously many of the cases for example B, E, F and G still\nhave call handling targets and metrics displayed in the centres.\nThe current operations focus of contact centres is to reduce call handling times, volumes\nand maximise the throughput of customers this is similar to manufacturing\u2019s past where\nthe reduction of cycle times and throughput was the focus. However, manufacturing has\npaved the way in quality management (Oakland, 2003) and has made the operational\nfocus on quality, cost and delivery to the customer. While the operational focus of\ncontact centres is primarily concerned with efficiency there is evidence from the\nempirical data that there is a move to a customer service focus.\nAlthough it has been found that efficiency is the main operational drive behind contact\ncentres there are still issues with customers being held in queues for a long time before\nbeing able to talk to a contact centre employee. These long queue times result in\n26\ncustomers abandoning their place in the queue and make the contact centre, and therefore\nthe organisation, inaccessible to the customer. This has been a major issue for case F\nwho at the time of this study were having queue times of over an hour for customers to\ntalk to an agent. By taking lessons learnt from manufacturing there needs to be quicker\nresponses to the customers needs and this can be achieved through job rotation and\nenhanced system and process design by utilising ICT to enhance the customer experience\nrather than simply improve productivity.\nImprovement approaches\nOne of the key issues surrounding improvement approaches in contact centres is that\nthere is little continuous improvement and no focus on innovation. When there is an\nimprovement focus it is on cost reduction and increasing productivity. A manager at case\nE said that \u201cwe have a lot of business improvement teams \u2013 green belts, black belts \u2013 to\nsave money and drive productivity\u201d it should be noted that the manager was talking about\nmanagement level employees and not agents, however from this quote it can be seen that\nthe drive is again focused on productivity. It is a key theme to the operational ethos of\ncontact centres.\nAt the moment improvement approaches in contact centres are focused around processes\nand from this study it was found that much of the improvement schemes were put in\nplace for employee involvement rather than business improvement. Again this is due to\nthe nature of the job as one agent demonstrated from case B \u201cthe \u2018buzz\u2019 days introduced\n27\nby management have fell flat as the agents didn\u2019t have time off the phone in order to\nenjoy the activities.\u201d This was also true in cases E and F where agents were not allowed\nto leave the phones so they could not be involved in any of the improvement teams,\nhowever in case F the employees who were not on the phones were able to participate in\nthe projects.\nTompkins et al. (1996) in Table 3 shows that manufacturing has a management\ncommitted to the quality improvement process. From the empirical evidence collected it\nwould seem that contact centre management still have a bias towards productivity\nfocused improvements. Therefore, a systems thinking (Checkland, 1999) and a culture of\ncontinuous improvement needs to be installed within contact centres before co-ordinated\nimprovement approaches will be evident in contact centres. Continuous improvement is\na key theme in the development of manufacturing operations, with many studies being\ncarried out into it (e.g. Bessant and Francis, 1999; Boer et al., 2000). It has been shown\nto improve employee morale, boost productivity and develop new methods of working.\nHowever, the nature of the job would have to be reconsidered in order for continuous\nimprovement to be truly adopted in contact centres.\nTompkins et al. (1996) identifies that \u2018waste elimination\u2019 is a key stage in the\ndevelopment of manufacturing and the pioneering work on lean manufacturing\n(Ohno,1988), looks at reducing wastes within manufacturing operations and has\ncontinuous improvement in the foundations of its principles. Although lean has been\nextensively studied and implemented in the manufacturing sector there is now a growing\n28\nfield in service operations and the contact centre industry has been no exception (Piercy\nand Rich, 2008). There is a number of the contact centres included in this study, namely\ncases G and H, embarking on lean improvement programmes at the time of this research.\nBut the evidence from these cases is that lean is being embraced for its cost reducing\noutcome and not its process improvement possibilities.\nExternal relationships and interaction\nAt the moment many contact centres do not have a positive relationship with their\ncustomers or the wider organisation, this could be due to the fact that contact centres are\noften at the periphery of the wider organisation. As part of the systems thinking\n(Checkland, 1999) approach organisations consider all the interactions and collaborations\nthat they are involved with.\nManufacturing is at the forefront of the supply chain management field but again services\nare also looking at service supply chain (Ellran et al., 2004) but at the moment contact\ncentres do not think about integration or collaboration in the same way which\nmanufacturing firms do. However, in this study there are some exceptions to this and\nsome actively benchmark with other contact centres and the industry body (the customer\ncontact association-CCA), case A is a good example of the type of external relationships\nand interaction that contact centres have as the operations manager said \u201cwe work with\nexternal organisations \u2013 have a lot of external people come in such as our clients \u2013 we\nhost events for the CCA\u201d.\n29\nTable 4 summarises the findings of this research, it can be seen that many of the issues\noccurring in current contact centre operations have also been issues for manufacturing in\nthe past. Therefore, there are a number of manufacturing theories that can be further\nextended into the contact centre context to alleviate some of the issues identified in the\nempirical field at this point in time.\nTable 4 \u2013 Theories from manufacturing which can apply to contact centre development\nArea Issues identified from case data Theories from manufacturing with\npotential for use in contact centres\nPerformance\nmanagement\n\uf0b7 Individual agent volume based metrics\n\uf0b7 Productivity based targets\n\uf0b7 Balanced performance measures\nincorporating quality measures\n\uf0b7 Awareness of total cost of quality\nManagement\nand\norganisation\n\uf0b7 Electronic surveillance by management\n\uf0b7 Employee involvement team\n\uf0b7 Teams are used to stimulate competition\nbetween areas of the centre\n\uf0b7 Participative management\n\uf0b7 More open communication\n\uf0b7 Self managed teams\nPeople\ndevelopment\n\uf0b7 Training is mainly focused on the usage of\nIT systems and processes\n\uf0b7 Agents are not given time off phone for\nother activities\n\uf0b7 Job design is restricted with no or little job\nrotation or enrichment\n\uf0b7 Extensive training and education\n\uf0b7 Cross-trained workforce with job\nrotation\nOperations\ncapability and\nautomation\n\uf0b7 Service is based on a mass production\napproach\n\uf0b7 Processes are governed by the IT system\n\uf0b7 Automation is used for contact avoidance\n\uf0b7 Flexible automation\nOperations\nfocus\n\uf0b7 Focus is on processing numbers and not on\nresolving customers needs\n\uf0b7 Focus is agent utilisation\n\uf0b7 Management committed to the\nquality improvement process\n\uf0b7 Customer service excellence\nImprovement\napproaches\n\uf0b7 There is little continuous improvement and\nno focus on innovation\n\uf0b7 Improvement focus is on cost reduction\nand increasing productivity\n\uf0b7 \u201cWaste elimination\u201d focus\n\uf0b7 Constant innovation\n\uf0b7 Customer service excellence\nExternal\nrelationships\nand interaction\n\uf0b7 Adverse relationship with customers and\nemployees\n\uf0b7 Limited contact with external\norganisations\n\uf0b7 Develop customer\/supplier\npartnerships\n30\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe aim of this research was to understand if contact centres can continue to base their future\non lessons learnt from manufacturing, with the research question driving this study RQ: Can\nthe mass production model of contact centres be improved by adopting methods that have\nmoved manufacturing from mass to modern manufacturing? Or do they diverge and follow\nanother path?\nFrom empirically investigating the issues that contact centres are currently facing it would\nimply that they have the same issues as manufacturing historically faced. Therefore, we can\nconclude that if manufacturing can develop from an industry founded on scientific\nmanagement principles then so can the contact centre industry. This means that contact\ncentres can be improved by adopting the methods that have moved manufacturing from mass\nto modern.\nThe findings of this research provide a useful starting point to discuss the ability of theories\ndeveloped in manufacturing to be adapted into the contact centre context. This research is a\nstarting point for further work into the applicability of manufacturing theories into the contact\ncentre environment and as such it is deliberately discussed at a high level of abstraction.\nFurther work will investigate detailed aspects of each of the issues and manufacturing\ntheories touched on in this paper.\n31\nREFERENCES\nAdler, P.
