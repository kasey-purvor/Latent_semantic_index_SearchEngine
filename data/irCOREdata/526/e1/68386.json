Introduction (\/ \n~N Superf luidi ty is the most remarkable of the properties \n4 (TW\" \nof liquid rte-:- The only other systems known to exhibit \ncomparable behaviour are the liquid phase of the other \nstable isotope of helium, 3rie, and the electron gas in a \nsuperconducting metal; it is believed that the nucleonic \nfluids in a neutron star may also be sup~rfluid, but this \nis less certain because data inevitably are scanty. \nSuperfluidity implies the possibility of non-dissipative \nflow of the fluid through a channel or, conversely, that \nan object may b e able to move through the stationa ry f luid \nwithout experiencing any viscous drag. \nAt temperatures well below that of its ~uperfluid \n4t= \ntransition (2.1~ at s.v.p.), which in practice usually \n4f t<\/ 4 \nmeans _!.<l. \u00b0\/j:.~ liquid He behaves as a superfluid in which \nthere exists a dilute gas of particle-like elementary \nexcitations. The superfluid has zero entropy and has zero \nviscosity, all the thermal energy of the liqui d being \ncarried by the excitation gas. An object moving through \nthe liquid will therefore encounter a slight resistance \nowing to its scattering of elementary excitations, but no \nresistance at all from the superfluid itself. The r e s i dua l \ndrag caused by the excitation gas will, of course, fal l \nrapidly with temperaturaas the excitation density decreases. \n, By employing simple arguments based on considerations \nof the conservation of energy and momentum, Landau (1941, \n1947) was able to account for the superfluidity of 4He in \\,___ __ \/ . \n-2-\nterms of the shape of the dispersion curve for the \nrv v \nelementary excitations. As discussed in \u00a7 \/1\/(a) below, a \n! -\nfundamental prediction of his theory is that there will be \na well-defined critical velocity above which the \nsuperfluidity will disappear and dissipative behaviour \nwill be observed. The main objective of the present work \nwas to test this prediction by measuring, as a function of \ntheir velocity, the drag experienced by negative ions \n\u00b7=#= \ntravelling through superfluid ~.H~ below 0. ~~' and thus to \nachieve an accurate experimental determination of the \nLandau critical velocity vL,' \n\"\\,\u00b7 .\u00a5 -v \nIn \u00a7 1 l i ( ~ ) we review very briefly the outcome of \nearlier attempts to measure the .critical velocity, and the \nreasons why they failed to yield experimental values of \n1 'l \n;!L\u00b7 We discuss in \u00a7 1(\u00a3 ) the motion of negative ions \nthrough pressurized superfluid 4He, and we indicate why \nthis particular experimental situation appeared to offer \na unique opportunity to test both Landau's theory and the \nsubsequent supercritical drag calculations of Takken (1970); \nand we describe the unexpected failure of experiments with \nthese purposes in view. More recently, however, it has \nbeen found that field emission characteristics in \nsuperf luid 4He display certain anomalous features when \npressure is applied to the liquid, and in \u00a7 ~(d) we indicate \nwhy these phenomena seemed to ' imply the feasibility \nof the present research programme based on the use of field \nI \nemission ion sources. \n-------~ \n[ __ _ \n,?et \nc< (a) \n-3-\n\/'lrl \") \u00b7\"'-\n\/'I\" \n4, < ____J \nLandau's explanation of superfluidity in , He \n~ \\\\\\ \nWe consider, as sketched in figure 1, an 6bject of \nmass m travelling with initial velocity ~e\u00b7 through a \nv' motionless fluid.

The inserts were built \non circular brass plates which could be bolted to the \nblock, with indium 'g ' rings providing the required \npressure-tight seal. \nThe tip, gate grids, guard rings and Frisch grid \nwere mounted on one insert; the collector on t h e other. \nMet a l components were mostly made of brass, separated by \nnylon spacers. Care was taken in designing t he a s sembly, \nto avoid large areas of exposed dielectric on wh ich charge \nmight have built up, thus distorting the electric f ield. \nThe grids were composed of 200 wires per i n ch nicke l mesh, \nattached to brass support rings with Aquad ag colloida l \nsilver paint. It was found that , with care, a grid-to-gr id \nspading of 0.5 mm (measured at room temperat ure) was \nfeasible. The tip itself was held approximately 2 mm away \nfrom the first grid, 311 \u2022 At this small separation, bubble \nformation around the tip could have led to arcing if operated \nat s,....  v. p.: accord i ngly, the normal setting- up procedure \nentailed applicat ion of the operating pressure of 25 x 105 Pa \nbefore the emitter was tested. The whole electrode assembly \nwas an easy sliding fit inside a nylon tube, which was itsel f \nmade to be an easy sliding fit in the hole in the copper \nblock. To promote rapid thermal equilibrium throughout \n\\ \n-16-\nthe chamber, 1 mm diameter holes were bored in the nylon \nsleeve, allowing good thermal contact between the copper \nwall of the chamber and the helium within the electrode \nvolume. \nThe collector insert consisted of a brass disk \nsurrounded by a brass guard ring, mounted on a nylon \ninsulator. The whole was spring-mounted on its brass \nendplate, with a free movement of some 3 mm to ensure that \nduring cooling a~d throughout the experiment the guard ring \nwas held in firm contact with the nylon sleeve of the \nother insert: at room temperature the spacing between Frisch \ngrid and collector was 0.5 mm. The same springing arrangement \nalso served to ensure that the electrode stack in the other \ninsert was always held under gentle compress i on. For both \ninserts, electrical connections were taken through metal-glass \nseals soft-soldered into the brass endplates. \nThe chamber dimensions were obtained by measuring the \nindividual components at room temperature, before assembly, \nand then applying suitable corrections for thermal contraction. \nAssuming the change in: length in cooling from room temperature \n\\,,-v \nwas 2% for nylon and O. 02% for brass, the length .Q, of the \n. ,c.\"'\u00b7\u00b7 \ndrift space \n1G 2 :..1@~ was calculated to be lo . 2 mm when cold. \nThe possible error in this figure is thought not to exceed \n5%. \n(c) Electrical circuit \nThe circuit used to provide the required d.c. electrode \n-17-\n~,__cs\u00b7 ~:-. \npotentials, to apply pulses to is \/ and G1 , and in processing IJ ..t \nthe signal arriving at C, is shown in block form in figure \nThe drift-space voltage was derived from a Keithley :it: \n246 stabilij:,ed power supply, capable of supplying 0~31ody, A.s \n7 . \nand connected \n'!Ai \nvia a decoupling RC network, to a chain of \n5 Mrt ~% metal film resistors. Mounted in the main liquid \n,\/ 1. \nhelium bath to reduce the number of high-tension leads into \nthe cryostat, these resistors formed a divider network by \nwhich the tip, gate grids and guard rings could all be held \nat the correct d.c. potentials. This power supply was \nswitched on only when necessary, as heating in the divider \nchain tended to cause a noticeably higher rate of evaporation \nThe potential difference V across the \nvfJ.- - D \nfrom the helium bath. \ndivider chain was measured on a Fluke 8000A digital voltmeter, \nr~\u00b7~ \nfloating at the ~3 p~tential, accurate to better than \u00b1 ~ 1%, \nand supplied via a l:iOOO potential divider composed of high \nstability metal oxide ,resistors, which had been calibrated 1-J \nusing a potentiometer.

The circuit's various \ntime-constants were chosen to be such that the pulses \narriving on the source and gate grid were square, and so \nthat no pulses reached the drift space electrodes, during \nthe flight of the ions. \nThe signal arriving at the collector was earthed \nthrough a 100 .JP~etal film resistor, , mounted immediately \n\"\\'I {j'\\F\"-\nnext to the endplate.

The averaging of a large \nnumber of such signals to generate a result like (b) was \nclearly essential for a high precision determination of the \nionic velocity. Under more favourable experimental conditions, \n'I'.::.\"\"\"' \nsuch as those of (c)-(f) where individual signals could clearly \n- -\nbe seen, averaging was still used in order to improve the \nprecision of the measurements. In practice, v3 was adjusted \n'_\/. \nso as to avoid the pulse-spreading effects associated with \nsignals which were too large. \n-22-\n0\/ \n!-\nThe fact that the (_:s4 : i~s) section of the signal is seldom \nflat may, at first sight, seem surprising; but there are two \nvery simple reasons why such a phenomenon might have been \nanticipated. Firstly, we note that the effects of the \ngate-opening pulse applied to 911 is to reduce by _y& the \npotential difference ~o\/ initially applied between ,S' and 31 , \nwhich would certainly result in a decrease of the total emission \ncurrent. Secondly, it is believed (Phillips ~\u00a3 Mcclintock \/ \/ &\\ \n11975) that, under d.c. conditions, the spacecharge which controls \n\\, ' \nthe magnitude of the emission current is composed of charged \nvorticity, even although the bulk of the current is carried by \nbare ions. It will take a finite time, after activating the \nemitter, for the equilibrium density of charged vorticity to \nbecome established: thus, if the gate opens d u ring this period, \na decreasing current pulse will be admitted to the drift \nspace. We believe that both these mechanisms are effective in \ndetermining the pulse-shapes which we observe in practice. \nThe procedure used f or determining the mean velocity of \nthe ions from an averaged pulse was to r_educe it as nearly as \n<:..?:- Q \npossible to the idealiz ed pulse shape discussed in \u00a72 ;(a) and \nillustrated in figure 5~\\ \u00b7 From the point plotter ~:cording \nof the signal, the transient point 12 at which the gate \nswitched off could be identified to within one channe l of the \n1000 - channel output from the signal averager memory, resulting \n\" . 3t \nin a measurement error of \u00b1 O. 5)3~ \u00b7 \ntrailing edge of the ion pulse \n~------\u00b7~--\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7- -- \u00b7----------\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7 \nPoint ~5 , where the \n\/\\ \n~l \n-- --23- ., \nreached the Frisch grid, was found by drawing straight \nlines through the top and the trailing edge of the pulse, \ntheir intersection being taken as the point ~s\u00b7 The \n. \ntransit time of the ions across the drift space c2q3 is \n~:.... \n= ! 5-t2 , and ~he mean velocity ji =}\/TD. The \n\/ \nestimated error in TD arising from this procedure is \n\u00b1 0.5% of the transient time. \nf \", \nFor the larger, better \ndefined, pulses the total error in TD is estimated as less \nthan 1%; and as less than 2~ for all the data presented \nin APpendix t\\ . \n(,~ -:: .,, \nWe note that the leading edge of the pulse ~3 :!4 ) \ntraverses the gate region of the chamber, while the \ntrailing edge does not. Thus any complications which \noccur inside the gate may affect the apparent transit time \nas determined from leading edge instruments, but not that \nobtained using the trailing edge. For this reason the \ntrailing edge has been used throughout in order to \ndetermine the transit time of the pulse. \n\\ \ni \nSchwarz (197~) has pointed out that the signal received \nI \nat the collector is modified by the detecting electronics \ndue to their finite rise time, and that points on the pulse \nfound by the method described above should be corrected by \nsubtracting a time 0.25T where CE is the rise time of the \ne e \nJ . \ndetector.

Discussion \n\/( \nIn this section we discuss our experimental data \nin the light of various theoretical predictions as to the \nform of v (E) . We compare our data with Landau's theory \n.,....-- ......... \nof superfluidity in (~). In (b) we suggest some reasons \n- -, \nwhy our data are inconsistent with Takken's (1970) \nsupercritical drag theory, and in (E ) we discuss how \nsupercritical energy dissipation by a light moving object \nmay be expected to differ from that caused by a very \nheavy object. We review Bowley ~ Sheard 1 s (~9,f s\u00b7) \ncalculations o f supercritical drag through single-roton \nand two-roton emission process~s, and compare our data \nwith their theori es, in (d) and (e) respectively. Finally, \nin (f), we include a brief speculative discussion of our \n-\napparent failure to find any evidence of the occurrence \nof one-roton processes. \n(a) Comparison with Landau 's theory~~~~~~ \nWe note from figure 9 that our v(E) data appear to be \n--\nvery much what would be expected on the basis of Landau's \ntheory. This becomes more immediately evident when we \nplot the net dra.g on the ion (=eE) as a function of its \naverage velocity throuf h the superfluid, as shown in figure \n11: the result at o.3 t~ can then be seen to bear a close \nresemblance to the behaviour depicted in figure 3 and, \nmoreover, the critical velocity which we observe appears \nto be equal to~L within experimental error. For \n'\u00b7\"' comparison, the corresponding curve for a negative ion in \n-30-\nnormal (non-superfluid) liquid 4He, where it can be \ncharacter0 d by a constant mobility, has also been \nplotted. The b~haviour is seen to be qualitatively \ndifferent in the two cases. \nThe pressure dependence of the critical velocity is \nalso of interest. Because a decrease in pressure results \nin an increase in 6 and a decrease in k , we expect that \n- o \nrvL ~ 6\/~0 will increase as the press~re is reduced, below \n2\u00b7-5xlo5 Pa. It may be seen from figure ~}!\\ that, although data \n.\/ 5 \nat 21 x 10 Pa could not be obtained for low electric \n* fields, the 21 x 105 PaJ ~. curve lies above that for \n25 x 10 5 Pa which seems to imply a change of _y,L with! \nin the expected direction. We will return to discuss this \npoint in more detail, on the basis of Bowley aQ~ Sheard's \nI 1 ti( \n(l975) theory of supercritical drag, in \u00a7 \u00b7 : t~). \nWe conclude that our experimental data amount to a \nstriking verification o f Landau's (1941, 19 47) explanation \nof superfluidity in liquid 4He. \n(b) The failure of Takken's theory \n'l \" As discussed in \u00a7 l(c) above, Takken's (1970) theory \npredicted that it should be almost impossible experimentally \nto cause ions to\u00b7 exceed_yL to a measurable extent. On \n~\" \nthe basis of (8) we would expect v to exceed vL by less than \n' it- - -\n4 x 10- 4 % when _::. = 200 kt -_1 whereas it -:;can be -~ seen in figure 9 \nthat the margin is, in reality, about 18%. Furthermore, \nthe form of the observed v(E) curve is quite different to \n....,.,,,.,,.--\nthat predicted by (8), which would bend upwards on plots \nsuch as those of figure 9. It seems clear, therefore, that \n-31-\nTakken's theory is not applicable to the motion of negative \nft \nions through pressurif ed He _\u00a5 below O. 5\/-:; The reason \nis probably connected with the relatively small mass of \nthe ion. \nThe assumption that roton creation is a coherent process is \nof doubtful validity unless the mass of the moving \nobject is very large. There are two reasons for this. \nFirstly, the object will have a random thermal velocity of \nJ., \n'-ft\\ ~ (3~131T\/M) 2 ; and, secondly, conservation of momentum \n\\) !) \ndlctates that, in emitting a roton, the forward momentum \nof the object be reduced by an amount ~v1 z 11k0 \/m. Unless \nm is very large, each of these effects will have a tendency \nto destroy any incipient phase coherence between the roton \nI\/,;' ,'l\/ \ncreation events.

The roton's momentum, however, being \nrelated to its phase velocity which by (11) is numerically \n- ,-, \nequal to the time-averaged velocity ve 1 ' of the object, \nremains positive. \nThe negative ion, which may be regarded as a non-localil:ed \nelectron trapped within a spherical void in the liquid, has \nan effective mass which is almost entirely hydrodynamic in \nnature and which therefore depends only on the ionic radius \nr~ and the density p of the liquid.

A convenient way \n. \\j \u00b7j \nof approaching the problem theoretically is to postulate that \nI \nthere exists a matrix element which determines the strength \nof the roton emission process, and then to ca lculate the \nform of v(E) which would then be expected, leaving the matrix \nelement as an unknown constant to be determined by experiment. \nThis procedure has been carried out by Bowley ~Sheard \n(1975) and we outline below, in a somewhat simplfied form, \nthe salient features of their calculation. \nBefore we do so, however, it is necessary to consider \nin more detail the influence of the dilute excitation gas, \nconsisting mainly of phonons and ~He isotopic impurities but \nals~ including a few rotons, through which the ion is moving. \n4 At low temperatures in pure He, roton emission will tend \nr \nto be the principal mechanism limiting the drift velocity \nof the ion, but there will of course also be a contribution \nto the net drag on the ion arising from the scattering of \nexcitations. Furthermore, because of the relatively small \nionic mass, individual scattering events will cause significant \nchanges in the instantaneous velocity of the ion. To look \nat the situation in another way, the ion will tend to have \na superimposed random thermal velocity amounting to about \n8% of its average velocity in the direction of the electric \nfield. Roton emission occurs, however, with a frequency \n-36b-\nof abo\u00b5t eE;fik\n0\n, this being the inverse of the time taken \nby the ion to increase its velocity by t k \/m . . Except for \n.. 0 l \nvery small values of E, this frequency is much larger than \nthe rate of excitation scattering events, and we may \ntherefore conclude that the influence on v of thermal \nfluctuations in the ionic velocity parallel to the field \nmay be ignored. \nThe effect on v of thermal ve l ocity fluctuations \nperpendicular to the field is more subtle. The quantity \nwhich we measure experimentally is the time-averaged velocity \ncomponent parallel to the field; but the time-averaged \ntotal velocity will be l a r qe r because o f t he t ransverse \n..c.~. -1 \nthermal velocity of t 4 m s The measured value of \n; ~ 50 ~ s-l will thus be smaller by about 0.4% than the \n'~ \naverage total velocity, which implies that the Landau \ncritical velocity as deduced from the data will be smaller \nby about 0.2 m s-l than its trc~e value. The magnitude \nof the difference will, of course, be temperature dependent, \nso we may anticipate that the apparent value of ~L will \nincrease as the temperature is reduced. These effects wi l l, \nhowever, be smaller than other uncertainties in our \nmeasurements. \nWe conclude that, for the range of electric fields \nand temperatures used in the present experiment, the net \neffect on v of thermal fluctuations in the ionic velocity \nis, to a good approximation, zero. \n-36c-\nFor an ion travelling precisely at v' there is only \none state into which a roton can be emitted, while \nsatisfying the conservation laws, and so the transition \nrate is negligibly small. As the ion accelerates beyond \nv', however, the rate R1 (v) rises rapidly because of the \nincrease in the number of possible final roton states. \nAs suggested by Reif ~Meyer (~9~~), it is convenient to \ntreat this problem using Fermi's golden rule \n41\" (\\(1 i \n~ yrtl \n= 2n1 \nh \nwhere Vk is the unknown matrix element, s and h]S. the energy \n-f\\ and momentum of the emitted roton, m. is the mass of the \nl \nion and v its velocity immediately prior to emission, and \n- J-~1function ensures conservation of energy.

There was no obvious reason, \non the basis of our present understanding of rotons, to \npredict such an effect in advance of the experiment; \nneither can we, even in retrospect, offer any physical \nexplanation of the phenomenon. If the single-roton process \nis, for some reason at present unknown, forbidden, then \nthis fact probably amounts to an important piece of evidence ,,...._ \n' \nconcerning the physical nature of rotons. Before completely \naccepting the two-roton hypothesis, therefore, it is \nessential to consider whether there is any plausible \nI \ni \n1 \nl \ni \nI \nI \nl \nI \n-52-\nalternative explanation for our experimental results. \nIt is, of course, possible that the theory outlined \nabove is wrong or inapplicable for some reason. Perhaps \nthe excitations which are generated by the ion may not be \nrotons at all but might, for example, be vortex rings? \nIt is true, after all, that some of the ions apparently \ncreate;. and become trapped by, vortex rings before they \nreach the collector (Mcclintock & Phillips \/ (l9f3 i. This \nsuggestion seems implausible, however, when we ~ote that \n. s~ru{~ \nthe critical velocity at which dissipation j 0mmenccr is \nfound experimentally to b e the Landau critical velocity \nfor roton creation: this is evident even on a plot such as \nthat of figure 11, where we have made no assumptions at all \nabout the way in which the superfluidity is breaking down. \nFurthermore, values of lL extracted from the data using (60) \n' \n'-,,,; \nshow an. increase with falling pressure (figure 19), whereas \nthe critical velocity for vortex nucleation by a negative \nion ' is known to decrease as the pressure is reduced( Schwarz ~\/ Jang \/ \n~ g7j) . .

The matrix element Vk which enters (32) \n-through a and (19) might, for example, be velocity dependent \nin just such a manner as to change the behaviour from the \n-----~-------\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7 \n-53-\n2 1 \nexpected } law to a 1 power law in (~-vL) , thus rendering a \nspurious resemblance to the two-roton formula (51). It \nwould certainly represent a remarkable coincidence if this f J; \n-1 \nwere so, considering the very large range of E (2 < E < 2ook m ) \n._. i ( \n-\nover which (51) is accurately obeyed and, although the \n\" \npossibility cannot be entirely discounted, we feel that it is \nfar more likely that the two-roton theory is in fact correct. \nThe probable applicability of the two-roton hypothesis \nover the range of our experiments does not, however, necessarily \nimply that one-roton processes are rigorously forbidden. The \nmatrix element Vk may be very small relative to v k so that, \n..- S '~ \nin a time less than t 1 , the ion accelerates beyond v~ and \nemits a pair of rotons. Of course, by reducing the electric \nfield we can increase the time taken by the ion to accelerate \nfrom v \n1\n1 to v 2 ', and thus increase the likelihood of \nsingle-roton emission. Single-roton processes, if they \nexist at all, are most likely to be found occurring under \n:t= \n-1 \nvery ksmall electr~c fields, in the region below 1 kv m where, \nin the present experiments, any such effects would be \nobscured by the scattering of 3He isotopic impurities and \nthermal excitations. \nAlthough we .cannot, of course, derive a numerical value \nof ~from the present experimental data we can, however, \ndeduce an upper limit for the magnitude of this matrix \nelement.
