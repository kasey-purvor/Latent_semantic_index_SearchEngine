A sequence of three subsequent auroral activa-\ntions (at 18:10, 19:48 and 20:00 UT) on 9 February 1997 is\nanalysed. The brightenings of optical auroras were collo-\ncated with latitudinally localized bursts of pulsating riome-\nter absorption and Pi3 geomagnetic pulsations. In two of\nthe cases, the strongest westward directed electrojet currents\nand the footpoint of the upward directed field-aligned cur-\nrents related to the auroral brightening were observed in the\nsame region as the largest amplitude of the pulsations and\ntheir polarization changed. In the third case, field-aligned\ncurrent signatures were present, but not so pronounced that\ntheir accurate location could not be defined. In all cases, the\nspectra of geomagnetic and absorption pulsations were simi-\nlar. Based on ground-based observations alone, it is difficult\nto say whether the energetic particle precipitation (riometer\nabsorption) was modulated by the geomagnetic pulsations or\nwhether the geomagnetic pulsations were caused by varying\nionospheric currents controlled by the precipitating particle\nintensity. However, the localized nature of both pulsations\nof the two different phenomena and their tight coupling with\neach other seem to support the latter option.\nKey words.

It is not yet\nexactly known which processes in the magnetosphere cause\nthe initial brightening of the auroral arc. The magnetic sig-\nnatures can be associated with the build up of the substorm\nCorrespondence to: N. Kleimenova\n(kleimen@uipe-ras.scgis.ru)\ncurrent wedge (SCW) (McPherron et al., 1973). Pi2 pulsa-\ntions are a consequence of the shear Alfve\u00b4n waves carrying\nthe field-aligned currents (FACs) in the wedge, and the iono-\nspheric part of the wedge (a strong westward current) causes\nthe negative X-bay. Pi2 pulsations have been recognized to\nbe a fundamental element in magnetospheric substorm mor-\nphology, since they can be observed in a wide range of lati-\ntudes and longitudes on the ground (Olson, 1999). However,\nduring the substorm sequence, Pi3 type geomagnetic pulsa-\ntions very often also occur with longer periods than Pi2. Ac-\ncording to Saito (1978), the substorm associated Pi3 pulsa-\ntions can be separated into two categories: the Ps6 type, with\nperiods longer than 400\u2013600 s and dominantly observed in\nthe D-component, and the PiP type, with periods less than\n400 s and amplitudes comparable in all three components of\nthe field. The PiP periods are from 150 to 400 s, and the\naverage amplitudes from several tens of nT to hundred nT\n(Raspopov et al., 1973; Kiselev and Raspopov, 1976). The\nonset of PiPs at the higher latitudes lags behind the onset\nat auroral zone latitudes, where PiPs can be accompanied\nby auroral intensity fluctuations in the similar period range.\nNagano et al. (1981) show that high latitude Pi3s with peri-\nods longer than 400 s are more commonly observed than PiP\ntype pulsations, and that the amplitudes of Pi3s are largest\nnear the center of the westward auroral electrojet. Accord-\ning to Suzuki et al. (1981), the distributions of nightside Pi3\nare similar to those of Pi2. Kleimenova et al. (1998) showed\nthat in the auroral zone, Pi3 pulsations (f \u223c 1\u2212 3 MHz) are\nvery localized in latitude and closely related to the substorm\nintensification.\nNumerous observations have indicated that substorm asso-\nciated energetic particle precipitation (as measured by riome-\nters) can have temporal variations with periods of 3\u201315 min,\ni.e. in the frequency range of Pi3 periods (Wedeken et al.,\n1979). Furthermore, it has been shown that in the auroral\nzone, the Pi2 pulsations are highly correlated with the pul-\nsating component of the riometer data (Stuart et al., 1977;\nHeacock and Hornsucker, 1977; Haldoupis et al., 1982).

The new point of this study is to anal-\nyse simultaneous observations of all three different types of\nphenomena. The behavior of auroral breakups, riometer ab-\nsorption variations and Pi3 type pulsations during a sequence\nof several subsequent activations is investigated in order to\ndemonstrate how these activations are spatially and tempo-\nrally coupled with each other and with the other expansion\nphase phenomena.\n2 Instrumentation\nMIRACLE is a two-dimensional instrument network con-\nstructed for studies of mesoscale auroral activity in the Scan-\ndinavian sector (Syrja\u00a8suo et al., 1998). The network includes\n25 magnetometer stations (the IMAGE network, Lu\u00a8hr et al.,\n1998), eight all-sky cameras (ASC) and the STARE radar\nsystem with two coherent scatter radars. The sampling rate\nof IMAGE is 10 s. The ASCs acquire images through filters\nof 557.7 nm and 630.0 nm with the sampling rates of 20 s\nand 60 s, respectively. This study utilizes IMAGE data and\nASC images recorded at Abisko (ABK, 68.36 N, 18.82 E).\nThe field of view of the ABK ASC at the 100 km altitude\nis a circle with the radius of approximately 300 km. Spa-\ntial resolution of the ASC varies between less than a one km\ndistance per pixel (near the zenith) to a few km per pixel\n(near horizon). Unfortunately STARE data are not avail-\nable for the event analysed here. Combined with the MIR-\nACLE data, we analyse recordings of a chain of 6 riometer\nstations: Ivalo (IVA, 30 MHz), one IRIS (Ionosphere Riome-\nter Imaging System) beam (IRI, 38.2 MHz) (Browne et al.,\n1995), Sodankyla\u00a8 (SOD, 30 MHz), Oulu (OUL, 32.4 MHz),\nand Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8 (JYV, 32.4 MHz). The riometers measure the\nvariation in the intensity of the galactic cosmic noise on the\nground. The intensity of observed signal is a function of the\nheight integrated electron density in the D- and E-regions,\nwhich, in the first instance, is a function of the energetic\n(more than 10\u201320 keV) electron precipitation. The sampling\nrate of the riometers is 10 s, and the beam covers at the 90 km\naltitude a circular area of 100 km diameter. Figure 1 shows\nthe locations in corrected geomagnetic (CGM) coordinates\nof the instruments used in this study.\n3 Observations\nOn 9 February 1997, the time between 12:00\u201324:00 UT was\nmagnetically very disturbed. The quicklook AE index (based\non the data of seven AE-observatories) shows at least four\nsubstorm-like activations, with peak AE values between 500\nand 1800 nT around the hours of 14:00, 18:00, 20:00, and\n22:00 UT. The WIND satellite was monitoring the solar wind\nat XGSM = 197RE (YGSM = 8RE , ZGSM = \u221216RE). At\n12:50 UT, the satellite observed a shock front with an abrupt\nincrease in the ion density and earthward directed plasma ve-\nlocity. The IMF direction was very variable until 16:20 UT,\nwhen IMF BZ suddenly changed to strongly negative val-\nues (below \u22125 nT) and stayed there until 21:00 UT. The de-\nlay time from WIND to the Earth\u2019s magnetopause is ap-\nproximately 35 min, if it is simply calculated using the mea-\nsured solar wind velocity (VGSM = 560\u2212 600 km\/s) and the\ndistance from the satellite to the Earth\u2019s magnetopause (at\nXGSM = 10RE). Real observations seem to follow this ap-\nproximation relatively well, since IMAGE recorded the sud-\nden impulse (SI) driven by the solar wind shock at 13:21 UT.\nFigure 2 (upper panel) shows the geographical location of\nthe auroral electrojets as a function of time. The latitude\nprofile of the X-component deviations recorded at the IM-\nAGE middle meridion stations have been upward continu-\nated to the ionospheric level, using the method of Mersmann\net al. (1979). In the upward continuated latitude profiles, the\nelectrojet boundaries are more pronounced than in the ground\nobserved profiles. The latitudinal resolution of the method is\n\u223c 0.8\u25e6. The lower panel shows the estimated intensity of the\nelectrojet current densities (J = 2X\/\u00b50).\nThe data of Fig. 2 show growth phase activity, i.e. an in-\ntensification and equatorward shift of the auroral electrojets,\nstarting at 17:00 and 18:30 UT. The effects of the expansion\nphase SCW currents are most clearly visible at the end of the\ngrowth phases, i.e. at 18:10 and 20:00 UT. At the ionospheric\nfootpoint of the upward field-aligned currents (FACs), there\nis a counterclockwise Hall current vortex. Consequently, on\nthe poleward (equatorward) side of the footpoint, westward\n(eastward) currents intensify. The vortices are seen as pairs\nof red and blue regions in the color plot of Fig. 2. Since\nonly X-component data is used in the analysis, the plot does\nnot show the effects of the poleward and equatorward cur-\nrents that cause the deviations primarily in the magnetic east\ncomponent below a vortex structure. In the latter case (after\nN. G. Kleimenova et. al.: Riometer and magnetic Pi3 during auroral activations 153\nFig. 2. The locations (in geographic latitudes) and intensities of the auroral electrojets as a function of time during the period of this study. In\nthe top plot, the blue (red and yellow) colors show the location of the westward (eastward) electrojet (currents are close to zero in the green\nregions) and in the bottom plot, a solid (dashed) curve shows the total current intensity of the westward (eastward) electrojet.\n20:00 UT), the vortex formed in a region previously domi-\nnated by the westward electrojet and thus a part of the east-\nward current is seen as \u201ca hole in the westward currents\u201d.\nNote that the plot also shows FAC-related signatures around\n19:20 UT, although these signatures are not as clear at 18:10\nand 20:00 UT.\nA set of ABK ASC images is shown in Fig. 3. The\nASC at ABK started to acquire images at 18:01 UT. The\nfirst images show dim auroral arcs in the zenith and some-\nwhat brighter arcs both in the southern and northern horizons.\nThe southern-most arc broke up at 18:10 UT and the activ-\nity spread rapidly from south to the zenith and later to the\nnorthern sky. Around 19:20 UT, the auroras in the southern\nhorizon brightened again (not shown), but the activity stayed\nso close to the horizon that defining the exact dynamics was\ndifficult. Around 19:48 UT, new bright auroras appeared to\nthe zenith and a further intensification in the activity took\nplace 19:52 UT, when a westward travelling surge (WTS) in-\ntruded from the eastern horizon to the zenith of the camera.\nThe WTS related activity continued in the entire sky of ABK\nuntil 20:27 UT.\nThe auroral brightenings at 18:10 UT and from 19:48\u2013\n19:52 UT can be associated both temporally and spatially\nwith the clear SCW signatures of Fig. 2. In the first case,\nthe breakup region was at the CGM latitude of 62.3\u25e6 and in\nthe second case it was at latitude 65\u25e6. According to Fig. 2,\nthe footpoints of the corresponding upward directed FACs\nwere at the CGM latitudes of 62.5\u25e6 and 66.5\u25e6 (the CGM lat-\nitude is roughly 3.5\u25e6 less than the geographical latitude in\nthis region). The weaker FAC signature in Fig. 2 (19:20 UT)\nseems to be temporally related to the auroral brightening at\n19:22 UT, but the spatial connection is not so clear; the auro-\nras are clearly more south than the strongest magnetic signa-\ntures.\nFigure 4 represents the magneticX-component and riome-\nter data: raw records (panel a), their dynamic spectra in the\nfrequency range of 0.5\u20134.0 MHz (panel b) and 1\u20133 MHz fil-\ntered data (panel c), recorded at the IMAGE and riometer\nstations shown in Fig. 1. The magnetic Y -component of\nPi3 pulsations is characterized by a little spectral difference.\nHowever, the space-time variations (not shown here) are sim-\nilar to the X-component. The spatial distribution of 0.5\u2013\n2.0 MHz geomagnetic pulsations is plotted in Fig. 5. Fig-\nure 6 demonstrates the integrated intensity of optical auroras\nin the approximate beam locations of the riometers IRI, IVA,\nand SOD.\nThe first auroral breakup caused magnetic effects primar-\nily at the southern stations of SOD and OUJ (Fig. 4, panel a,\nand Fig. 6). The breakup was accompanied by a short burst\nof riometer absorption observed at a very narrow latitudinal\narea (SOD) and in the Pi3 range pulsations both in the ri-\nometer and magnetometer data (Fig. 4). Both the riometer\nand magnetic pulsations have a maximum intensity at\u223c 0.5\u2013\n2.0 MHz, were recorded simultaneously at the same lati-\ntudes, and were aproximately in anti-phase (Fig. 4, panel c).\nIn both spectra, there is also an amplitude enhancement in\n154 N. G. Kleimenova et. al.: Riometer and magnetic Pi3 during auroral activations\nFig. 3. ASC frames recorded at the sta-\ntion ABK around the times of the auro-\nral intensifications (18:10 UT, 19:48 UT\nand 20:00 UT).\nthe PiP range (2\u20134 MHz). The phase of the PiP magnetic\npulsations at SOD led the wave phase at OUJ for about one-\nthird of the average wave period. The rotation of the polar-\nization vector at these stations was the opposite: clockwise\nat higher latitudes (SOD) and counterclockwise at lower lat-\nitudes (OUJ), i.e. that the source of the wave is located be-\ntween these stations. The 0.5\u20132.0 MHz (Pi3) pulsation shows\nthe similar morphological properties and there is no reason to\nseparate PiP and Pi3 into different types.\nThe top panel of Fig. 5 shows the map of the spatial distri-\nbution of Pi3 geomagnetic pulsation amplitude integrated for\nthe time interval of 18:00\u201318:20 UT. The area of the maxi-\nmum amplitude is marked with the gray shading. The map,\ntogether with Figs. 2 and 4, demonstrate that the strongest\n0.5\u20132.0 MHz magnetic pulsations were recorded in the same\nregion as the strongest riometer absorption, and this was the\nsame region where the footpoint resided of the SCW related\nupward FAC resided and where the auroral breakup took\nplace. More accurately, the footpoint of the FAC was be-\ntween stations SOD and OUJ, which observed the pulsations\nwith different phases. A very sharp attenuation of the Pi3\namplitude can be seen in Fig. 5 (top panel) near the CGM lat-\nitude of 65\u25e6. This boundary cannot be the polar cap boundary\nsince auroras were also observed on its poleward side, but it\ncan correspond to the tailward edge of the substorm activity\nregion in the near-Earth magnetosphere (Baker et al., 1996).\nThe riometer absorption and Pi3 activity around 19:30 UT\n(Fig. 4) are most probably associated with the auroral and\nmagnetic activations at 19:20 UT. It is interesting to note that\nthe riometer pulsations (Fig. 4, panel b) are strongest in the\nsouthern region (SOD) where the auroras were strongest,\nwhile the magnetic signatures, pulsations and the FAC-\nsignature in Fig. 2 dominated at higher latitudes (KEV).\nThe next period of strong pulsation and riometer activ-\nity started around 19:48 UT. The magnetometers in Fig. 4\n(panel a) show that the negative deviation in X was at first\nthe strongest at OUJ. The bay was accompanied by a burst of\nthe pulsating riometer absorption and Pi3 geomagnetic pul-\nsations. The middle panel of Fig. 5 shows the spatial dis-\ntribution of Pi3 geomagnetic pulsations at 19:40\u201320:00 UT.\nDuring this period, the maximum of the Pi3 amplitude was\nlocated near OUJ, which is at lower latitudes than during\nthe first breakup (18:11 UT). The rotation of the polarization\nvector of geomagnetic pulsation (both Pi3 and PiP range)\nchanged between SOD and OUJ. At this time, contrary to\nthe first breakup, the rotation was counterclockwise at higher\nlatitudes (SOD) and clockwise at lower latitudes (OUJ). This\nwould suggest that the upward FAC was between SOD and\nOUJ. In this case, the electrojet boundary plot of Fig. 2 does\nnot provide further confirmation for this conclusion as it does\nfor the first breakup (clear FAC signatures are visible only af-\nter 20:00 UT).\nWhen the WTS moved above the zenith of ABK around\n20:00 UT the riometer and magnetic activity also shifted to\nhigher latitudes. The most intensive aurora was observed\nat \u223c 20:05 UT, northward of ABK, and the center of the\nwestward electrojet shifted to the CGM latitudes of 66\u201367\u25e6\n(Fig. 2). The strongest riometer absorption, and riometer and\nmagnetic pulsations (both PiP and Pi3) were observed at the\nsame latitudes. The direction of the vector polarization of Pi3\npulsation was clockwise near KEV, and the Pi3 polarization\nreversal occurred between KEV (CGM latitude of\u223c 66\u25e6) and\nSOD (CGM latitude of \u223c 64\u25e6), which is somewhat south of\nthe FAC footpoint (CGM lat 66.5\u25e6) as suggested by the plot\nin Fig. 2. The spatial magnetic-Pi3 distribution for the period\nof 20:00\u201320:20 UT is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 5.\nN. G.

The magnetospheric origin of\nexpansion phase onset arcs is known to be within the central\nplasma sheet (Feldstein and Galperin, 1985; Birn and Hesse,\n1998), or more accurately, at the inner border of the central\nplasma sheet near the region of dipolarization (Ranta et al.,\n1977). On the other hand magnetic reconnection, which is\nmost likely the original energy source of the expansion phase\nactivity, takes place in the mid-tail region (XGSM \u223c 20RE).\nConsequently, variations in the reconnection process cannot\ndirectly cause the modulations in the energetic precipitation\nor in the magnetic pulsations. Nevertheless, reconnection can\nindirectly control the appearance of the pulsations, since it\ncauses fast earthward directed plasma flows, FACs, and the\ndipolarization of the geomagnetic field on the earthward side\nof the reconnection region. FACs cause pulsations primarily\nin the Pi2 range, but the breaking of the earthward directed\nflows in the region of quasi-dipolar field lines (Shiokawa et\nal., 1997) may cause lower frequency hydromagnetic waves,\nwhich can modulate the intensity of energetic particle precip-\nitation. Nevertheless, such interaction processes are likely to\ncause global effects, while our observations show a poor cor-\nrelation between geomagnetic observations at stations whose\nseparations are clearly less than the Pi3 wavelengths.\nBreakup arcs have been shown to have their magneto-\nspheric origin adjacent to the energetic (30\u201380 keV) electron\nisotropic boundary (Lui and Burrows, 1978; Elphinstone et\nal., 1996). This means that under average conditions, ener-\ngetic electrons should be trapped equatorward of the breakup\narc. During the growth phase, however, the riometer ab-\nsorption usually increases in the breakup region (Pytte et al.,\n1976; Ranta et al., 1981). Consequently, in the corresponding\nmagnetospheric region, some non-linear processes, probably\nrelated to the stretching of field lines to a more tail-like con-\nfiguration, cause a randomisation in the motion of energetic\nelectrons. For example, the cyclotron instability of trapped\nenergetic electrons modulated by a ULF wave could cause\nsimilar oscillations in the riometer absorption, as observed in\n156 N. G. Kleimenova et. al.: Riometer and magnetic Pi3 during auroral activations\n09 FEB 1997      18:00-18:20 UT\n19:40-20:00 UT\n20:00-20:20 UT\nFig. 5. The spatial distribution of the 0.6\u20132.0 MHz magnetic pulsations in CGM coordinates; asterisks show the station locations.\nthis study. The magnetospheric inductive electric field has\nalso been suggested to cause variations in the energetic and\nsoft auroral precipitation (Kauristie et al., 1995). In this sce-\nnario, the inductive electric field would disturb the energiza-\ntion process of the cross-tail curvature drifting particles that\ngain energy from the convection electric field (Pellinen and\nHeikkila, 1978, 1984). However, this model predicts a single\nfading of the precipitation prior to the onset rather than a se-\nquence of pulsations.\nOptical auroral arcs are caused by soft electron precipita-\nN. G. Kleimenova et. al.: Riometer and magnetic Pi3 during auroral activations 157\nFig. 6. The integrated intensity of opti-\ncal auroras (in arbitrary units) as a func-\ntion of UT in the regions of the riometer\nbeams at IRI, IVA, and SOD.\ntion with very discrete and localized structure (Weimer et al.,\n1994). Auroral precipitation and the related FACs can os-\ncillate in the frequency range of 1\u20134 MHz (Samson et al.,\n1996). Moreover, numerous observations (Wedeken et al.,\n1979) have indicated that substorm associated injections of\nenergetic particle precipitation can have variations with peri-\nods of 3\u201315 min. The oscillations of particle precipitation as-\nsociated with fluctuating upward FACs can enhance the con-\nductivity of the ionosphere and cause periodic variations in\nionospheric currents, which are observed as ground magnetic\npulsations in the same frequency range. The fluctuations in\nthe ionospheric electrojets caused by fluctuating FACs as a\nsource of irregular geomagnetic pulsations have been dis-\ncussed, (by, e.g. Wilhelm et al., 1977; Nagano et al., 1981;\nSuzuki et al., 1981). Kleimenova et al. (1998) showed that\nduring the evening-nighttime, the high latitude Pi3 pulsations\nare typically very localized in latitude and closely associated\nwith the substorm intensification. We observed these pulsa-\ntions in the magnetic field and in the energetic precipitation,\nbut their existence in the optical aurora remains without con-\nfirmation, since the other time variations in the auroral activ-\nity efficiently shield the probable pulsation-type variations.\nPaquette et al. (1994) studied simultaneous riometer and\nmagnetic pulsation events that took place during the daytime.\nThey tested the hypothesis suggested by Coroniti and Kennel\n(1970) which associates the coupled magnetic and precip-\nitation pulsations with the ULF modulation of VLF wave-\nparticle interactions that take place at the magnetospheric\nequator. In this scenario, a ground-based observer in an ap-\npropriate location would observe significantly the onset of\nriometer pulsations before the magnetic pulsations since the\nelectron propagation time from the source region to the iono-\nsphere is much shorter than the Alfve\u00b4n transit time. Roughly\none-third of the events of Paquette et al. were consistent with\nthe theory of Coroniti and Kennel. In one-third of the cases,\nthe magnetic pulsations were observed before the precipita-\ntion pulsations, which was most likely due to the localized\nnature of the riometer observations when compared to the\nmagnetic field measurements. In the remaining third of the\nevents, the onsets of riometer and magnetic pulsations were\nsimultaneous. A natural way to explain such behaviour is to\nassume that the fluctuations in the particle precipitation mod-\nulated the ionospheric conductivity and currents, and thus\ncaused the magnetic pulsations (Heacock and Hornsucker,\n1977; Rosenberg et al., 1981; Haldoupis et al., 1982). In none\nof our events did the onset of riometer pulsations preceed the\nmagnetic pulsations. Thus, these events do not provide clear\nsupport for the theory of Coroniti and Kennel. At the auro-\nral breakup on 18:10 UT, the onsets of the two types of pul-\nsations were simultaneous, which suggests that the scenario\nof modulating ionospheric currents would be more valid, at\nleast for this specific case.\nProfound evidence of magnetic Pi3-pulsations, generated\nby modulating ionospheric currents, is presented in the study\nof Haldoupis et al. (1982), where riometer and magnetic\nrecordings are analysed together with the data of the STARE\nVHF-radar. In the radar data, pulsations with a similar fre-\nquency (T\u223c 3\u20134 min) as in the magnetic and riometer data\ncan be seen in the backscatter intensity (which is proportional\nto the electron density), but not in the electric field. The\nauthors associate the magnetic variations with ionospheric\nHall-currents which vary due to the precipitation fluctua-\ntions. In their case, the pulsations in the riometer and mag-\nnetic X-component were in phase, while in the events anal-\nysed, here the two types of pulsations were both in phase\nand anti-phase: at 18:10 UT, the absorption pulsations were\nstrongest at SOD and they were in anti-phase with the mag-\nnetic pulsations at the same station (Fig. 4, panel c), while\n158 N. G. Kleimenova et. al.: Riometer and magnetic Pi3 during auroral activations\nafter 20:00 UT, the absorption pulsations recorded at IRI\nwere in phase with the TRO magnetic pulsations. Similar\nto the study of Haldoupis et al., the magnetic pulsations can\nbe associated with Hall-currents and especially associated\nwith the Hall-current vortices at the footpoints of the up-\nward enhancing FACs at the auroral breakups. At 18:10 UT,\nSOD (OUJ) was northward (southward) of the FAC foot-\npoint and thus the enhancements in the precipitation (cor-\nresponding positive dB-values in Fig. 4, panel c) and in\nHall-currents caused negative (positive) deviations in the X-\ncomponent and consequently, the riometer and X-pulsations\nwere in anti-phase (phase). After 20:00 UT, the magnetome-\nter stations TRO, KIR, KEV were southward of the FAC\nfootpoint and consequently, the enhancement in the Hall-\ncurrent caused positive X-deviations at these stations (Fig. 4,\npanel a). The systematics in the pulsations, however, are not\nclear, e.g. the riometer pulsations recorded at IVA are in anti-\nphase with the X-pulsations recorded at the nearby stations\nKEV. Unfortunately, STARE data are not available for this\nday and thus we cannot check whether electric field varia-\ntions could explain the non-systematic behaviour.\nThe magnetospheric mechanism which generates the pul-\nsations in the energetic precipitation still remains an open\nquestion. In the model of Coroniti and Kennel (1970) for\ndayside activity, the basic mechanism that causes particle\nprecipitation is the VLF wave-particle interaction process at\nthe magnetospheric equator. In the nightside, the particle pre-\ncipitation is also controlled by the substorm related changes\nin the magnetic field configuration. When the magnetotail\nstretches, for example, during the substorm growth phase,\nparticle trajectories become randomised near the equatorial\nplace which causes precipitation. According to the present\nunderstanding, substorms can be associated with activity in\ntwo different regions: The current disruption region in the\nnear-Earth tail and the reconnection region in the mid-tail\n(Baker et al., 1996; Lui, 1978). The observations analysed\nin this study were made in the conjugate region of the near-\nEarth magnetosphere and thus it is reasonable to assume that\nthe Pi3 pulsations were related to the current disruption pro-\ncess.\nThe mechanisms of acceleration of the breakup associated\nwith soft precipitation and energetic precipitation are differ-\nent. Acceleration region processes at an \u223c 1\u20132RE altitude\ncontrol the distribution of soft auroral precipitation while\nthe processes near the magnetospheric equatorial plane con-\ntrol the appearance of energetic precipitation. The exam-\nples analysed in this study, as well as the events analysed\nby Lazutin et al. (2000), demonstrate that the most intensive\nauroral brightenings and injections of energetic precipitation\nare coupled both spatially and temporally. The observations\ngive the impression as if the injections of energetic particle\nprecipitation would catalyse the build-up of field-aligned po-\ntential and create a drop in the acceleration region. Under-\nstanding of the interaction process between these two sepa-\nrate magnetospheric regions is a challenging issue for future\nstudies.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nBased on our observations, we can conclude that:\n\u2013 Substorm related bursts of Pi3 geomagnetic pulsations\nare very localized on the ground. and they coincid with\nthe bursts of riometer absorption. The spectra of riome-\nter and geomagnetic pulsations are similar;\n\u2013 Pi3 pulsations (magnetic and riometer) are spatially and\ntemporally coupled with auroral breakups and upward\ndirected field-aligned currents;\n\u2013 In one of our breakup events, the onsets of riometer and\nmagnetic pulsations were simultaneous which leans to-\nwards supporting the theory that relates magnetic pul-\nsations to ionospheric conductivity modulations rather\nthan the theory that suggests a common magnetospheric\nsource region for both riometer and magnetic pulsa-\ntions.\nAcknowledgement.
