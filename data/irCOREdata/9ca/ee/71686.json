This trend is clearly illustrated by the globalization of \nservice firms over the last two decades (Aharoni 1993; Daniels et al. 1988; \nEnderwick 1989). Occupations ranging from retailers (Wrigley et al. 2005) to \ntemporary staffing agencies (Ward 2005) have set about establishing \noverseas subsidiaries but perhaps of most significance has been the \nglobalization of a number of professional industries, exemplified most \nprolifically by accountancy firms and most recently by the newly emerging \ncadre of transnational law firms. Intricately wrapped up in the globalization \nprocess as \u2018lubricators\u2019 of global economic activities (Dicken 2003), these \nglobal professional service firms (PSFs) are now involved in all of the major \ncross-border corporate deals and operations that dominate discussions in \npublications such as The Financial Times.  \nIn the earliest stages the emergence of a multinational configuration \nwas noted in transnational service firms (Daniels 1993). The new outposts \nof predominantly US and UK originating companies were controlled by their \nrespective headquarters and leveraged competitive advantages developed \nin the home country of the firm. Consequently, overseas branches primarily \ncatered to the needs of existing clients as they themselves globalized. In \n 4\ncontrast, it is now increasingly recognised that new forms of competitive \nadvantage have to be generated through globalization. Bartlett and Ghoshal \n(1998) describe how transnational forms of control are based upon inter-\nsubsidiary and subsidiary-headquarters consultation and collaboration that \ninforms innovation, decision-making and strategy. As has been described in \nrelation to law firms, this can take the form of inter-office collaboration, \nknowledge sharing and learning (Faulconbridge in press) as well as cross-\nreferrals of work and the inter-office mobility of employees (Beaverstock \n2004). Implicit yet not always central in discussions of such contemporary \norganizational architectures is acknowledgement of their social foundations. \nFor example, Jones (2002) draws our attention to the fact that diffuse, \ntransnational, modes of control and power mean \u201cglobal corporate strategy \nis a negotiated and fluid phenomenon that emerges\u2026\u2018from a continual \nprocess of discussion\u201d (Jones 2002: 346). Such negotiations are inevitably \npolitically charged. Bartlett and Ghoshal (1998: 204 original emphasis) point \nout that those chief executives that are successful at managing \ncontemporary TNCs are those \u201cconcerned with the perceptions and \nbehaviours of individual managers within the organization, trying to ensure \nthat they share an understanding of the company\u2019s purpose and values, an \nidentification with boarder goals, and commitment to the overall corporate \nagenda\u201d. Hence, for Morgan (2001) managing a transnational firm is a \ndelicate process that involves negotiating the construction of social, \nrelational spaces and communities that facilitate managerial coordination \nand control.  \n 5\nIn this paper we use the management of transnational law firms to \npoint to what we see as a surprising void both in these \u2018socially sensitive\u2019 \napproaches to the analysis of global PSFs (e.g. Morgan 2001; Jones 2002) \nand in more normative theories of recent organizational change (e.g. \nCooper et al. 1996). These literatures acknowledge the difficulties of \nimplementing the hierarchical, efficiency-led management systems used in \nmany TNCs and the lack of HQ-led coordination in PSFs. However, they \noften struggle to account for this peculiarity, in part because they try to \nexplain the globalization and management of PSFs using theory developed \nthrough the study of manufacturing organizations and without consideration \nof the peculiarities of professional behaviours and norms. Therefore, here \nwe use empirical data collected through interviews with lawyers working for \ntransnational law firms to begin to explain how the archetypal transnational \norganizational form is compromised in PSFs by the agency of reflexive and \nspatially heterogeneous professionals. In particular we show that the \npeculiarities of professionalism as an occupational principle (Freidson 2001; \nMintzberg 1983; Raelin 1991) mean lawyers, as professionals, demand \nautonomy in their work and input into the strategic direction of the firm. This \nprevents most forms of hierarchical, top-down management, means global \ncoordination of the firm becomes difficult and makes negotiations \ncumbersome as all partners seek to contribute to decision-making. In \naddition we show how spatially variegated, institutionalised professional \nprojects create nationally contingent work behaviours, beliefs and ideals. \nThe latter is what we term the \u2018varieties of professionalism\u2019 (c.f. Hall and \nSoskice 2001; Whitley 1998) and what others have called the national \n 6\nsystem of the professions (Burrage and Torstendahl 1990). Combined this \nmeans that not only are negotiations relating to the organization and \ncoordination of the firm awkward to manage but also that agreement about \nmanagement strategy is hard to reach as the principles and work-related \nbeliefs and ideals of lawyers vary between offices. It is our contention that \nunderstanding these characteristics and effects of professionalism might \nprovide more intricate and insightful analyses of the globalization of PSFs \nand explain the unique organizational forms used by globalizing PSFs, their \nspatial variability and consequently their often suboptimal, irrational and \nidiosyncratic nature.    \n The rest of the paper, therefore, proceeds over five further sections. \nThe next section explores the different ways the globalization of PSFs has \nbeen theorised and documented and, in particular, why \u2018socially sensitive\u2019 \nanalyses have been called for. The following section then suggests such \n\u2018socially sensitive\u2019 analyses might benefit from the incorporation of \nunderstandings of professionalism and its affects on the organizational \nstructures of global PSFs. Here the idea of the \u2018national varieties of \nprofessionalism\u2019 is fleshed out. The following two sections then explore \noriginal empirical material that highlights the peculiar management \nstrategies used in global legal PSFs (consultation and consensus) and the \nway professionalism and its spatial varieties create fragmented \norganizational forms that are anomalous compared to those used in many \nmanufacturing firms. The final section offers some conclusions and calls for \nfurther consideration of the nature and effects of professionalism in a range \n 7\nof industries and the implications of this for the all-encompassing use of the \nterm PSF. \n \nGlobalization and the changing PSF \nThere is much debate about the exact meaning of the term PSF (e.g. \nAlvesson 2004; Lowendahl 2005), something we do not want to become \noverly embroiled in here. Instead, for the purposes of this paper we use PSF \nto refer to firms employing professionals, as defined in the strictest \nsociological sense. This means industries where entry and practice is \nclosely regulated as part of a professional project, something that creates \nshared identities and values for all in the profession (Freidson 2001; \nBurrage and Torstendahl 1990). This usually refers principally to \naccountants, architects, lawyers and medical doctors (Broadbent et al. \n1997) and not some of the other industries (e.g. advertising, management \nconsultancy) classed as PSFs because of the bespoke and knowledge rich \ncharacteristics of the services they provide. As we show below, deliberately \nusing such a strict definition, something others including ourselves have not \ndone in the past, is significant and has important implications for the way we \nuse the term PSF. However, this also means that we should be cautious not \nto over generalise from our findings. Our data pertains to globalizing law \nfirms. This can begin to inform discussions of other professional industries \nbecause of the professional principles of a formalised education system, \nmarket closure and regulation that are shared with accountancy, \narchitecture and medicine. Many of the organizational challenges faced by \nlaw firms have been or are currently being faced by these professional \n 8\noccupations. However, law is also potentially different in many ways to \nthese other professions. We, therefore, use the case of law to support our \ncall for wider studies of all professions as a pressing research need and \nreturn to definitional issues at the end of the paper.   \nAway from such definitional concerns, interest has been shown \nacross the social sciences in, broadly defined, the globalization of PSFs \n(Aharoni 1993; Daniels 1993; Cooper et al. 1996; Brock et al. 1999; \nLowendahl 2005). Interest in law firms is one of the most recent \npreoccupations because of the relatively late globalization of these firms. \nWhilst the first transnational law firm, Baker and McKenzie, began opening \noverseas offices in 1955 it wasn\u2019t until the late 1970\u2019s that others began to \ndevelop a coordinated globalization strategy. Thus, law firms have a \nsignificantly less pronounced global footprint than other professions such as \naccountancy (Beaverstock et al. 1999). The globalization strategy of these \nglobalizing law firms (table 1) is to target key financial centres and open \noffices where existing clients have business interests and new clients can \nbe recruited. They seek \u201cto provide consistently high quality advice that \ncombines technical expertise, and an understanding of the commercial \nenvironment in which our clients operate\u201d. Thus, their strategy is to \u201coffer in-\ndepth local knowledge and a uniquely global perspective\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.cliffordchance.com\/about_us\/about_the_firm\/ [accessed \n12\/12\/2006). In effect, these law firms stitch-together global deals by using \ntransnational legal arrangements. \n[Insert table 1 somewhere here] \n \n 9\nRationalising globalization \nThis globalization process can, in many ways, be explained using \nexisting scholarship examining the globalization of PSFs. Here, the more \nintricate analyses have used Dunning and Norman\u2019s (1987) eclectic \nparadigm to theorise the logic behind globalization (Bagschi-Sen and Sen \n1997; Beaverstock 2004). This reveals how globalization can be explained \nwith reference to three forms of advantage gained through foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI). \n \nOwnership advantages \u2013 when the unique assets of the firm, whether they \nare the knowledge of employees or the reputation accrued through years of \nhigh quality service provision, are leveraged overseas.  \nLocation advantages \u2013 the payback gained from presence in a particular \nplace or market. For instance, presence in a particular strategic location can \ngenerate significant benefits by supporting firm-wide innovation through the \nknowledge assets generated by key overseas offices (Faulconbridge 2006; \nLowendahl 2005). \nInternalisation advantages \u2013 the reimbursement gained when FDI rather \nthan licensing or franchising is used to deliver a service is, in certain \ncircumstances, of paramount importance.  \nThus, in the contemporary PSF the aim is to create competitive \nadvantage by organizing in a way that allows the assets held by one branch \nto be leveraged by other subsidiaries. This requires, however, effective \ncoordination strategies.  \n \n 10\nManagerial practices in global PSFs \nOne consequence of the globalization of PSFs is said to be the need \nto reinvent the organizational forms used to manage office networks. In \nparticular, the abandoning of traditional organizational configurations of \nprofessionalism and partnership (P2) has been noted (Greenwood et al. \n1990). In the P2 form control and coordination are characterised by \nintimacy, informality, negotiation, compromise and collegiality. It has been \nsuggested that firms are restructuring themselves around a new archetype, \nthe Managerial Professional Business (MPB), where there is a \u2018significant \nrefocusing upon the business and management values of efficiency, cost-\neffectiveness, central strategic control, and internally differentiated \nstructures\u2019 (Brock et al. 1999: 219). In other words, new opportunities \nconnected with globalization, de-regulation and technological innovation are \nsaid to have triggered a managerial revolution and the emergence of new \noptimal forms of governance in firms that allow the centralised coordination \nof worldwide activities.  \nGlobal PSFs should therefore be expected, according to archetype \ntheorists (Brock et al. 1999; Cooper et al. 1996), to \u2018introduce, rationalize \nand bureaucratize the process of strategic planning\u2019 in order to create new \ncompetitive advantage across global office networks (Hinings et al. 1999, \n141). This is expected to include the emergence of a dedicated managerial \nhierarchy, equipped with powers of imperative coordination, which can help \nminimise the disruptions caused by political negotiations between actors in \ndifferent parts of the firm. Hybrid figures such as lead partners and \nmanaging partners are appointed and equipped with increasing executive \n 11\npowers. The former are given a \u2018strong responsibility for directing partners in \nother offices, setting fee levels and hours to be worked\u201d whilst the latter \n\u201chave responsibility for the business plans of their units and for the \nevaluation of partners and all staff\u201d (Hinings et al. 1999: 142). Such \ndescriptions suggest a clear departure from the democratic, participatory \nand equalitarian traditions of the P2 form and recommend that functions \nsuch as billing, customer service, training, recruitment and quality \nassessment are extracted from the idiosyncratic and ad hoc approaches of \nindividual professionals and administered according to official company-\nwide procedures and regulations.  \nThere is little doubt that important changes have been taking place in \nthe way law firms are managed as they have globalized. As Hanlon and \nShapland (1999) describe, large law firms in particular have had to be \nreorganised to fulfil the requirements of evermore demanding corporate \nclients. In this context, the work of lawyers is being reconfigured by growing \ncommercial pressures as well as by the realities of operating in increasingly \nlarge and complex organizations that can employ several thousand \nprofessionals. Our interpretation of this significant process departs \nsomewhat however from the account offered by archetype theorists. In \nparticular, we are sceptical about the extent to which such a wholesale, \nuniform and uncontested \u2018managerial\u2019 revolution has occurred and argue \nthat whilst work on archetype reconfigurations captures some important \nempirical trends, it is somewhat under-socialised, especially when compared \nto the body of literature reviewed below. As a result it fails to fully recognise \nthe role played by professional values, behaviours and identities in the \n 12\norganization of PSFs. Indeed, Gray (1999) suggests that any change is \nlikely to be restricted by the reflexivity of professionals in law firms and their \nresistance to the outright abandonment of traditional professional values. \nMeanwhile Flood (1999) argues that spatial variability (in his case between \nEnglish and US lawyers) means that isomorphism and the adoption of \nhomogeneous organizational forms and practices across space are unlikely.  \nWe, therefore, attempt to understand the way the globalization of \nlegal and other PSFs has been influenced by reflexive professional agents. \nWhen Morgan (2001:119) suggested \u201cthere is very little recognition that \nfirms are social spaces with actors and rules that are socially embedded\u201d he \npointed to an increasingly troubling lacuna in research on global firms. Too \noften firms are positioned as \u2018black boxes\u2019, devoid of human subjectivities, \nagency and relationships (Taylor and Asheim 2001). Much corrective work \nhas begun to rectify this issue in recent years (e.g. Beaverstock 2004; \nEmpson and Chapman 2006; Jones 2002) but often the insights gained do \nnot percolate into wider theorising relating to the management and \norganization of contemporary global PSFs. We, therefore, focus in detail \nupon how an appreciation of the oddities of professionals as social actors, \ntheir professionalism and professional practice can help us understand the \norganizational forms adopted by PSFs.  \n \nBringing the professional back into PSFs \nA useful starting point in the search for ways to fertilize recent studies \nof PSFs with understandings of professionalism is through the insights \nprovided by work on the sociology of the professions. The contribution of \n 13\nTerry Johnson (1972) represents a key moment in the study \nprofessionalism. His realization that professions are not always specific \noccupations per se but that they can also be groups adopting a particular \nmethod of organizing and controlling work helped free the sociology of the \nprofessions from its earlier taxonomic concerns. Professionalism is, thus, \nrecast as a particular work organization method where the occupation itself, \n\u201crather than consumers in an open market (entrepreneurship) or \nfunctionaries of a centrally planned and administered firm or state \n(managerialism)\u201d (Freidson 1994: 32), retain control over work, including \n\u201cthe social and economic methods of organising and performing this work\u201d \n(Freidson 1970: 185-86). This autonomous form of working contrasts with \nalternative occupational principles, such as entrepreneurship and \nmanagerialism, where work is organized according to either contractual \nrelationships in (relatively) open markets or through a rational-legal \napparatus of formal regulations implemented through managerial \nhierarchies.  \nThis distinction between different occupational principles provides us \nwith an important reference point for understanding recent development in \nPSFs. Professional workers are not only bound by the rules of their \nemploying organization but also by the standards, principles and objectives \nof their occupation, something which they internalize following a long period \nof formal training and informal socialization (Montagna 1968). The most \nimportant point here is that professional values are not always reconcilable \nwith organizational employment. Indeed, there is extensive research \ndocumenting the frictions and conflicts faced by professionals in \n 14\nbureaucratic settings. Work by Montagna (1968), Johnson (1972) Mintzberg \n(1983) and Raelin (1991), consistently suggests that professionals tend to \nresent supervisory arrangements and regard managerial decisions as \n\u2018arbitrary and inconsistent\u2019. Consequently there is a fundamental tension as \nmanagers expect professionals to follow organisational procedures and \ngoals, just like any other employee, whilst professionals often struggle to \nreconcile their employment duties with the occupational principles and \nmethods of their profession (Raelin 1991: 2). Indeed, more recently, \nCovaleski et al. (1998) suggest that transnational accountancy firms attempt \nto override these professional norms using a socialization mechanism \nwhereby senior partners champion the benefits of managerial coordination \nand control of work. However, as they note, this is often resisted, both by \nthe socializers and socialized, because of the persistence of professional \nideals.  \nIn addition, there is an extra lawyer of complexity associated with \nprofessionalism. Larson\u2019s concept of the professional project is particularly \nuseful in understanding the foundations of important work-related norms, \nvalues and identities (1977). This, then, is the strictest sociological definition \nof professionalism and identifies the way professionalism can act as a socio-\neconomic advancement strategy. Two features of professionalism are \nimportant here (Abel 1988): \nControl over the production of producers (occupational closure). This \nrepresents an ensemble of technical, cultural and social requirements that \nlimit access to occupational opportunities (and the various associated \nrewards) to a restricted circle of eligibles. Most commonly this exists in the \n 15\nform of the registration requirements necessary to practice as a lawyer, \narchitect or other formal professional. Registration is only granted to those \nmeeting the clearly defined conditions of entry to the profession. In particular \nsuch closure allows professions to control the supply side of their market \n(Abel 1988) with the benefits being considerable as professionals can \nmaximize the financial (and social status) rewards associated with their work \nwhilst enjoying the possibility of reconciling supply and demand trends in \ntheir own markets.  \nControl over production by producers. The professional project is not \nonly concerned with \u201cwho produces the services but also [with] how they are \nproduced, distributed and consumed\u201d (Abel 1988: 176). This brings us back \nto the occupational definitions described above as existing regulations can \nhelp to isolate professionals from managerial coordination and \nrationalization. \nThe current organization of the legal profession (and accountancy \nand architecture) is, in Larson\u2019s terms (1977), the outcome of such a \nsustained occupational project. This is grounded and facilitated by a \ndynamic web of relationships between a number of distinct actors (Burrage \net al. 1990; Nelson and Trubek 1992).  These include: \n\u0001 The state that can recognise monopolies, legitimize restrictive \npractices and, particularly in the common law world (i.e. England and \nthe USA), grant an autonomous regulatory capacity.  \n\u0001 The practicing professionals who through their actions and collective \nbehaviours are said to sustain a common identity or culture. \nTogether, as described below, the interactions between professionals \n 16\nand the other actors listed here lead to agreement on the \ntechnicalities and modes of professional practice followed by all in the \nprofession.  \n\u0001 Educational institutions reinforce the ideals of regulators but also the \npractices of professionals by socializing a new generation of \npractitioners as they undergo compulsory regulated training. They \nalso support evolutions in practice through the development of \ncoherent body of knowledge and provide the formal credentials that \ncan support effective closure regimes.  \n\u0001 Clients define and legitimize professional practice through their \ndemands and expectations.  \nThis is important in our argument as the interactions between these actors \ncreate regulated and institutionalised norms, values and ideals relating to \nprofessional work that are shared by those in closed, regulated and defined \nprofessional arenas. Moreover, these norms vary over time and space \naccording to the shifting roles, interests, priorities and resource capabilities \nof the actors. This has important consequences for the characteristics of any \none national professional project (Burrage et al. 1990; Larson 1977).  \n \nNational varieties of professionalism? \nThe embeddedness of the global organizational networks of PSFs \nboth in home and host countries creates added layers of complexity in the \nmanagement of firms. As the main arguments in the varieties of capitalism \nliteratures highlight, approaches to the organization of firms vary between \ncountries because of nationally distinctive institutional settings. Hall and \n 17\nSoskice (2001: 13) argue that \u201cthe institutions of a nation\u2019s political economy \nare inextricably bound up with its history in two respects. On the one hand, \nthey are created by actions, statutory or otherwise. On the other, repeated \nhistorical experience builds up a set of common expectations that allows the \nactors to coordinate effectively with each other\u201d. In professional contexts, \nexpectations and institutionalised norms are determined by the nationally \nspecific influences of the various actors involved in their professional project \nand the ways these socializing influences affect the early years of training \nand practice of professionals. This is, then, what others have called the \nnational system of the professions (Burrage and Torstendahl 1990; Lane et \nal. 2002) and we term the \u2018varieties of professionalism\u2019. Nelson and Trubek \n(1992: 179) describe its effects on professionalism in law firms in the \nfollowing way:  \n\u201clawyer professionalism is not a fixed, unitary set of values, but instead \nconsists of multiple visions of what constitutes proper behaviour by lawyers. \nConceptions of lawyer professionalism reflect \u2018the arenas\u2019 in which they are \nproduced, that is, the particular institutional settings in which groups \nconstruct, explicitly or implicitly, models of the law and lawyering\u201d.  \n \nLaw provides, then, an ideal case study to see how the influences of \nnational professional projects influence the organization of globalizing PSFs. \nDespite moves towards transnational jurisdictions and institutions (Sklair \n2001; Trubek et al. 1994), the legal profession is closely connected to the \npolitical and juridical system of its country of origin. After all, lawyers in their \nrole as mediators and adjudicators of entitlements and obligations, make a \nfundamental contribution to those \u2018governmentality\u2019 networks that support \n 18\nindependent nation-states and their capacity to govern. In other words, of \nthe four agents previously identified, the state, which is arguably the least \ntransnational in their orientation, exercises a particularly strong influence on \nthe development of the legal profession, its work and organization. \nInevitably these strong local connections somewhat reduce the extent to \nwhich legal knowledge and practices can be reproduced across jurisdictions \nwhilst the differences between legal systems and cultures multiplies the \nscope for tensions, incompatibilities and misunderstandings within \nglobalizing law firms. So, for example, Morgan and Quack (2005) note how \nsuch influences mean German lawyers have traditionally been less \nentrepreneurial and business orientated than English or American lawyers. \nSpace prohibits us providing further detailed examination of these variations \n(but see also Flood 1995; MacDonald 1995). The important point here is \nthat it is necessary to develop analyses of the way professionalism as an \noccupational principle and as a professional project influences the behaviour \nof all professionals working for globalizing PSFs and, related to this, the \nspatially fragmented nature of professional practice, systems and ideals. \nThis will make it is possible to better understand the forces constraining and \ndetermining the organizational forms used by globalizing PSFs. Below, we \nexamine empirical material to make this case for law firms before \nconsidering the significance of these findings to other professional industries \nsuch as accounting.   \n  \n \n \n 19\n \nProfessionals and their influence on organizational forms in law firms \nThe rest of the paper is based on a series of 25 interviews with \npartners in the London and New York offices of fifteen of the top twenty \ntransnational law firms by number of offices. Individuals held a range of \nroles which are identified in the quotes used and, significantly, all had \nexperience of various aspects of the \u2018management\u2019 of global legal PSFs. \nLondon and New York were chosen as venues for the interviews for two \nreasons. First, the major globalizing law firms (table 1) emerged from these \ntwo cities and partners in these offices often have extensive experience of \nthe challenges of setting up overseas offices\/practice groups. Talking to \nthese individuals allowed the complexity of opening overseas offices that \nemploy locally qualified personnel to be uncovered. Second, it allowed \nexploration of the challenges US and UK firms have faced when opening \noffices in one-another\u2019s backyards. American and English business systems \nare often lumped together as one category \u2013 Anglo-American - because of \nthe points of convergence that exist. However, this is especially misleading \nin relation to professional industries where as many differences as \nsimilarities can be identified (MacDonald, 1995). Whilst the well-known and \nless subtle differences between UK and German systems have been \nextensively explored (e.g. Lane et al. 2002; Morgan and Quack 2005), \nvariations within Anglo-American professional systems have received limited \nattention. We begin to rectify this issue here.  \nAll interviewees were questioned about (a) the way the global legal \nPSF they worked for was organized to create effective integration and \n 20\ncoordination; (b) the distinctiveness of the approaches used and the \nreasons for this; and (c) the advantages\/disadvantages of the forms of \norganizing used. Interviews lasted 50 minutes on average with all but two \nrecorded and fully transcribed. The themes outlined below emerged as key \nissues in all of the interviews completed.   \n \nProfessional autonomy and transnational negotiations \nInterviews suggested that lawyers entered the profession with, and \nover time became even more fervently wed to the belief that autonomy over \nboth ends (the type of work completed) and means (how work is completed) \nis necessary in the type of innovative, bespoke legal practice global law \nfirms specialize in. Consequently, it was suggested that management styles \nand systems must not impede the ability of individual lawyers, and partners \nin particular, to behave and work independently as \u2018responsible\u2019 \nprofessionals. As two lawyers described it: \n\u201cSo in terms of initiatives to build a practice and build workflow, yes I do \nhave a fair degree of autonomy\u2026Autonomy is extremely important to \npartners and there has to be a sense in which within the confines of a \nstrategy of the office, practice group or firm, there must be a degree of \nautonomy where each partner acts\u2026\u201d (5, partner, US law firm in London). \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t like being managed and want to have autonomy [but] It\u2019s important \nto be part of a firm and share resources because it allows you to do the \nmost interesting work that otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to manage\u201d (12, \nPartner, US law firm, London). \n \n 21\nThis suggests, then, that the ideals of managerialism described in archetype \ntheory are somewhat overplayed. Instead, professional values and logics \nremain in law firms. This, of course, does not mean global PSFs can operate \nwithout any form of management. Rather, as the quotes suggest, \nmanagerial approaches need to be colonized and adapted so as to allow \ncoordination but also maintain professional ideals. Indeed, different firms \nhave adopted managerial approaches to varying degrees with some placing \ngreater degrees of imperative coordination and control in the hands of \nsenior\/managing partners than others. This is the dilemma faced by those \nrunning global legal PSFs. Heavy-handed, hierarchical management that \nenforces policies, procedures and narrow strategy is likely to cause dissent \nand ultimately the departure of lawyers. As one interviewee said, \u201cmy \npreference as a manager is that people consult me in advance so I don\u2019t \nhave to jump and try to implement something. It\u2019s awkward, it undercuts the \nother people, it doesn\u2019t make the feel very good if you do that\u201d (8, head of \npractice group, London). However, too greater degrees of laissez-faire \ncontrol can be equally destructive. Consequently, negotiated forms of what \nmight be called organizational professionalism are needed. This requires a \nunique approach whereby an inclusive form of consultation is used in the \n\u2018management\u2019 process that recognizes the value of professional autonomy \nbut also the constraints that large-scale organizing brings. Table 2 provides \ndetails of areas interviewees highlighted as being subject to such forms of \nprofessional-sensitive \u2018managerial\u2019 coordination.  \n \n[Insert table 2 here] \n 22\n \nDespite the introduction of such degrees of managerial coordination in \nPSFs, the approach to developing and implementing organizational strategy \ncontinues to be unlike that found in most TNCs and certainly can not be \nunderstood in strictly functional or efficiency-optimization terms (Ackroyd \n2002). In hierarchical organizations, as most TNCs are, the chief executive \nsurrounded by an executive board of directors makes strategy decisions \nwhilst managers at the branch level see to their implementation (Empson \nand Chapman 2006). In contrast in law firms all partners (and partners \nrepresent at least one eighth and up to half the workforce) are given the \nopportunity to contribute to strategic planning. This is, in part, a function of \nthe partnership system. In effect, every partner is a co-owner of the firm and \nhas an equal right to influence the way the firm operates. Indeed, the all-\npartner vote remains the ultimate sanction for changes to the organization of \nthe firm. Consequently, the day-to-day running of the largest firms is \ndelegated to committees, typically at the practice group level. Through these \ncommittees all partners are consulted about plans and strategy for the \npractice group they are part of. As one lawyer describes the management \nprocess: \n\u201cyou cannot manage a law firm in the same way as you can in a corporation \nwhere there\u2019s a power structure and someone orders you to do something, \nand this is the reporting line, it just doesn\u2019t work\u2026What you do find at all \nlevels within these structures, at practice group level or geography, is a \nprocess of ideas bubbling up, consultation coming down, well before you \never get to the decision level\u2026And you have a lot of \u2018low level\u2019 one on one \nconsultation, not necessarily very formal consultation, where you\u2019re trying to \n 23\nidentify and build a consensus before you ever put anything to a formal \ndecision\u201d (22, managing partner, New York). \n \nThose on committees have to be voted into the position they hold and can \nequally have their limited authority removed by a vote from fellow partners. \nIn effect, they represent rather than manage their peers when heading or \nchairing one of these committees.  \nUnderstanding these impacts of professionalism on PSFs is made all \nthe more significant by the further complicating affects of the \u2018varieties of \nprofessionalism\u2019. Together the focus on partner autonomy in firms and \ncultural heterogeneity mean orthodox forms of globally aligned organization \nbecome difficult. Instead reconstituted architectures are needed so as to be \nresponsive to the interests, values and aspirations of the powerful \nprofessionals that ultimately generate profit for the firm. However, this \nmeans that gelling the firm together and aligning the priorities of all of the \nstrategic workers can become difficult.    \n  \n\u2018Varieties of professionalism\u2019 and complex organizational forms in \nglobal legal PSFs \nFor globalizing legal PSFs the challenge of managing professionals is \nexaggerated by the affects of the geographically distributed and embedded \noffice networks that reach across Europe, North American and South East \nAsia. The type of negotiation and consensus building alluded to earlier has \nto be sensitive to the norms, ideals and beliefs of professionals emerging \nfrom different national systems or what, as suggested previously, might be \n 24\ntermed the \u2018national varieties of professionalism\u2019. This dilemma is not \nparticularly new and has been faced by all globalizing PSFs. Indeed, when \nBaker and McKenzie, the original global law firm, opened its first overseas \noffice in Caracas in 1955 and subsequently other offices in Europe it was \nrecognized that the key challenge was the fact that  \n\u201cThe firm had no blueprint to show it how to patch together a m\u00e9lange of \npartners from every major culture, religion, race, and language group on \nearth\u2026it had no model for whether to give local offices autonomy or weld \nthem together in tight hierarchical structure. Compounding the problem of \nfacing totally new issues, the personalities or the early partners sometimes \ncreated stumbling blocks. Many were highly individualistic and \nentrepreneurial men who rankled at any attempt to control the way they \npracticed law\u201d (Bauman 1999: xi-xii). \n \nIt could be argued that little progress has been made in the past fifty years \nto rectify this problem. As one lawyer put it: \n\u201cit happens all the time, you comment \u2018that\u2019s very German\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s very \nAmerican\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s very British\u2019. You do tend to recognize and see and \ncomment upon it, but also understand and accept, the cultural \ndifferences\u2026And you can come to decisions and create consensus, \nrecognising that people are coming from different cultures and creating \nsomething that works across the cultures\u201d (2, managing partner, UK law \nfirm, London). \n \nNearly all law firms have chosen to approach globalization through the \ncreation of global partnerships whereby all partners, wherever they are \nlocated, abide by the same partner constitution and have an equal input into \n 25\nthe strategy of the firm. Perhaps one of the best examples of the challenge \nthis can create can create can be found in the recently demised Coudert \nBrothers partnership. This firm, identified by Beaverstock et al. (1999) as a \nleading globalizer, collapsed in 2005 after an exodus of partners from offices \nthroughout the world. Whilst there are multiple stories to be told in relation to \nthe firm\u2019s demise, a significant element in the process was the inability of \nsenior and managing partners to implement an organizational structure that \nrecognised the need for partner autonomy and sensitivity to cultural \ndifference yet also the need for a strong-centre that ties the firm together \n(New York Law Journal 2005).  \nAt one level the difficulties of this have been documented in relation \nto the challenges of managing different conceptions of lawyering in common \nand civil law traditions (Morgan and Quack 2005). In addition, more subtly \nand closer to the focus of this paper, organizational and working \narrangements in UK and US originating global law firms have also be shown \nto be distinct, creating challenges for firms when opening offices overseas \nand implementing \u2018home\u2019 country influenced strategies (see table 3). \n \n[Insert table 3 here] \n \nWe can characterize UK lawyers, then, as being more collegial in their \napproach to management, practice and organization. The importance of \nseniority in remuneration systems, as well as the sharing of responsibility \nwith regards to key activities such as training and decision-making, provides \nevidence of such a collectivist approach. This is in contrast with the more \n 26\nindividualist style that typifies US-based firms. Similarly, UK solicitors seem \nto prefer more informal arrangements and methods with less reliance on \nformal targets, procedures and mechanisms than their American \ncounterparts. The reasons for such differences are complex but we can \nbegin to explain them by considering the differences in the legal \nprofessional projects in each country. For example, the extent to which \nlarge-scale, commercially orientated legal practice was permitted in England \nand the USA varied significantly until relatively recently. As noted earlier, US \nlawyers have had the freedom to develop commercial, megalaw, practices \nfor many years (since at least the late 1800s)1. In contrast, in England the \nemergence of large, commercial, law firms is a recent phenomenon. \nRegulation prohibited law firms from having more than 20 partners until \n1967 and even then large firms failed to emerge until the mid 1980\u2019s, in \nparticular being spurred by \u2018big bang\u2019 in London (Flood 1995). Consequently \nthe norms of professionals in law firms, and the values created and \nreinforced by universities differ because of divergent expectations about the \ncharacteristics of professional work. Similarly clients have different \nexpectations of their lawyers.  \nThese norms translate themselves into a heterogeneous set of \npractical arrangements that can cause all kinds of tensions when bought \ntogether in one firm. As the lawyer quoted above also went on to note, \u201cOur \noffice in Bangkok can\u2019t expect us to run it as a Thai law firm. Our office in \nDubai can\u2019t expect us to regard the Middle East as the centre of our \nuniverse because its only two percent of our business\u2026And the UK is in no \nway the major jurisdiction now, forty percent is UK, twenty percent is US, \n 27\nthirty percent is in Europe, so it\u2019s really quite a diverse mix\u201d. This complexity \nis a major challenge. It is recognized that having \u2018locally embedded\u2019 offices \nis important but this cannot lead to locally fragmented islands. This would be \nuntenable in organizations that aim to provide globally aligned and \nintegrated services. Consequently somewhat idiosyncratic organizational \nforms are needed.  \n \nOrganizing globally around multiple professional cultures \nAs a result of the issues described above, the organizational forms \nused by global legal PSFs exhibit unique spatial variegation and reflexivity \ntowards the influence of the \u2018local\u2019 cultures they are embedded within. As \none interviewee suggested:  \n\u201cHere you have one of the fundamental management dichotomies in \nmanaging large law firms\u2026Generally the practice group is given a high \ndegree of autonomy as to how it manages its practice. So there\u2019ll be steers \nfrom the global practice head that filter down but how we execute the game \nplan, who we think our targets are, how we implement them is totally down \nto us [locally]\u2026It is different from how you manage from a business \nservices point of view where it is much more centralised policy, much more \noutput to the region saying this is what you need to do. When it comes to \npartnership affairs, every member has an input with high involvement. So \nthe centre has to reach out to all the partners in all the offices to \ncommunicate things, so you get a persuasive mode (24, partner, UK law \nfirm in New York). \n \n 28\nThis highlights, then, how in global legal PSFs a limited array of top-down, \nhierarchically controlled policies exist alongside numerous spatially \nvariegated, locally peculiar and \u2018embedded\u2019 approaches that professionals \ncontrol and dictate. Table 3 gives examples of how key operational, \nstrategic and financial issues (Cooper et al. 1996) are dealt with in the legal \nPSFs studied using such an approach. \n \n[Insert table 3 here]       \n \nDesigning effective remuneration models for use in transnational PSFs is \nprobably one of the best-known challenges associated with the varieties of \nprofessionalism (Flood 1995). The legal press have also extensively \ndocumented the differences that exist, in particular between the models \nused in US and UK law firms (The Lawyer 1999; 2004; New York Law \nJournal 2005). In the UK remuneration is normally determined using the \nlockstep system. This privileges years of service as the major variable in \nremuneration level. Its underlying ethos is one of teamwork and the model \nuses the ideal that seniority conflates with ability and contribution to the \nsuccess of the firm. In contrast, in the USA the \u2018eat what you kill\u2019 model \ntends to dominate2. Here the major variable is billable hours charged to \nclients (i.e. profits made) and there is no relation to years of service. \nLawyers \u2018compete\u2019 and are self-reliant in the sense that their salary is a \ndirect reflection of their financial success in the past twelve months. These \napproaches reflect the differing and ingrained professional logics of lawyers \nin the two jurisdictions (table 3) and can even be traced-back to the \n 29\nsocializing effect of law school where, in the USA, students are ranked \nhierarchically according to performance whereas, in the UK this is not the \ncase. Consequently, when, for example, the lockstep is implemented in New \nYork (or vice-a-versa and the \u2018eat what you kill\u2019 model is used in London) \nthis causes significant tensions. As one interviewee noted: \n\u201cOne of the problems many firms are facing is that if you\u2019re in a lockstep \nyou don\u2019t know anything else. And you jealously protect the system \nbecause its part of your culture. And you are suspicious about systems that \ntry to differentiate because it\u2019s counter cultural. In a performance related \nculture, the problem is it tends to promote a star culture. And it tends to \nincentivize partners to become starts. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, \nbut it tends to be at the expense of collegiate and cooperative behaviour. \nSo there is a different in ideals between the two, and it can be very \ninteresting\u201d (2, managing partner, UK law firm, London). \n \nBeing \u2018interesting\u2019 has meant, for many English firms merging with US firms \nand implementing lockstep remuneration, the loss of many of the most \nskilled and respected lawyers in the US office. These individuals normally \nearn most in an \u2018eat what you kill\u2019 system and forcing them to accept \nlockstep normally causes so much ill feeling that they leave the firm and \ntake their intellectual capital and rainmaking (profit generating) abilities with \nthem. It has, therefore, been noted by the legal press (The Lawyer 2004) \nthat many firms have reverted to a type of reconfigured \u2018hybrid\u2019 model, as \ndescribed in table 3. This both maintains global coordination and alignment \nof remuneration but also allows local embeddedness and sensitivity to \nprofessional peculiarities. So, for example, a number of English firms now \n 30\nuse a modified lockstep that maintains years service as the primary variable \nin remuneration but also adds-in performance measures which can provide \n\u2018super points\u2019 that boost a partner\u2019s salary. These super points are used to \nreflect high levels of fee earning and are used most extensively in \u2018eat what \nyou kill\u2019 jurisdictions.  \nThis shows, then, that law firms continue to face a real quandary \nbecause of conflicting organizational\/managerial logics and professional \nsensibilities. An alternative strategy to that described above is the logic used \nby many firms for the management of training programmes (table 3). Here it \nis recognized that a combination of the different regulatory environments \ncontrolling training programmes for newly qualified lawyers (defined by \ndisciplinary enforcement bodies such as the Law Society in England) and \nthe different cultural approaches to associate mentoring taken by lawyers, \nsomething reinforced by the nature of university education (table 3), result in \nthe need for locally-specific organizational approaches that cannot be \nreplicated throughout the firm. Of course, this is the most extreme form of \nnon-isomorphism and creates even less centralized \u2018control\u2019 structures than \nin hybrid approaches. A limited degree of sharing of best practice and an \ninability to standardize training is the likely outcome. In organizations so \nreliant on the knowledge of their workforce this would seem paradoxical. It \nis, however, necessary because of the peculiarities of professionals who \ndemand the autonomy to work in ways they see (culturally) fit.  \n \n \n \n 31\n Conclusions \nThis analysis of the impact of professionalism and its spatialities on \nthe organization of PSFs ultimate returns us to our initial discussions of \nextant theory on the globalization and definition of PSFs. In terms of \nglobalization, professional idiosyncrasies mean that ownership, location and \ninternalization advantages are not necessarily as easy to exploit as is \nsuggested by the eclectic paradigm. As our analysis suggests, lawyers, as \nprofessionals, treasure the occupational principles of independence and \ndiscretion. This legacy of autonomy is reflected in a series of practices in \ntransnational law firms such as the reliance on committees and the \nconsensual approach to decision-making, something that interferes with the \n\u2018managerial\u2019 priorities of integration, expediency and efficiency often \nassociated with successful globalization strategies. Existing studies of global \nPSFs have somewhat under-theorised these impacts of the employed \nprofessionals on organizational strategies and hence the problematic nature \nof attempts to transplant concepts developed from studies of manufacturing \norganizations to the study of PSFs.  \nWe have also shown here that, in addition, integrated organizational \ndesigns and coherent practices are also hindered by the existence of \nspatially diverse forms of professionalism and professional projects and the \nresultant variations in how professional work is defined, managed, evaluated \nand remunerated across national jurisdictions. This is what we refer to as \nthe \u2018varieties of professionalism\u2019 and has a dramatic impact on the way in \nwhich the embedded relational networks used by PSFs are organized and \nmanaged (Dicken et al. 2001). It means that bridging the cultural gap \n 32\nbetween spatially heterogeneous professionals and their values through \nnegotiations is essential (Ackroyd 2002). This all points to the importance of \nfully exploring the spatial peculiarities of professionalism; something that \nhas been neglected in recent times and not incorporated into discussions of \nthe organizational forms of globalizing PSFs.  \nOf course, out of necessity the remit of this paper is more to set a \nnumber of future research questions and highlight current empirical lacuna \nin relation to these topics, rather than provide substantive and definitive \ndiscussions. The example of accountancy firms shows why such a task is so \nimportant. As noted, these firms have a much greater geographical reach \nthan law firms and have been negotiating the challenges of professionalism \nfor many years. We drew on the work of Covaleski et al (1998) to highlight \nhow these firms manage professionalism through attempts to socialize \nprofessionals into organizational logics. However, we know little about how \nthe principles and values of professionalism vary compared with those \ndescribed here for law and the complexity of the varieties of professionalism \nis not addressed in this work. The fact that accountancy firms remain \nnational partnerships operating as jurisdictionally independent entities under \nan overarching corporate umbrella does, of course, mean that the \nchallenges of the national varieties of professionalism will be different to law \nfirms where global partnership agreements have to cater to the sensitivities \nof lawyers worldwide. Increasingly accountancy firms have suggested they \nmay adopt the global partnership mode, although to date there are few signs \nof movement in this a direction, and the case study of law offered here might \nprovides us with a conceptual lens through which we could approach the \n 33\nstudy of this issue. Providing a conceptual frame for such research is, then, \none of the main aims of this paper.  \nThis, then, brings us back to the start of the paper where we noted \nthe importance of raising questions about how to define PSFs. It may be \nlegitimate to question the broad use of the term PSF and attempt to redefine \nthe concept based upon comparative studies of both \u2018traditional\u2019 \nprofessional industries (accountancy, architecture, law etc.) but also the so-\ncalled nouvelle professions (advertising, executive search and project \nmanagement) with, of course, in the case of management consultancy and \naccountancy the two breeds coming together in one firm. It seems likely that \nwe will find significant variations in the meaning and values of \nprofessionalism between these industries and, therefore, diverse \nmanagement challenges. In such studies the distinction made between \noccupational professionalism (the principle of autonomy) and professional \nprojects and their associated actors and legacies seem likely to be \nimportant. We suggest that theorising the identities, values and associated \nbehaviours of professionals, in a range of organizational settings, should be \nbased on understanding of these two dimensions, thus requiring in-depth \nstudies of professionals and their values and how these, together with \nregulators, educational institutions and clients, negotiate historically and \nspatially contingent structures, configurations and practices. Here it might \nalso be profitable to make links to debates on transnational governance \nregimes and changing institutional systems (Djelic and Sahlin-Andersson, \n2006; Morgan and Quack 2005). The way each profession, as a coherent \ngroup of actors, is or is not becoming global through the standardization of \n 34\nprocedures, ideals and norms and the mechanisms behind this (including \nthe role of TNCs as drivers of change and national institutions as resisters or \nenablers of change) seems increasingly important. In this sense what we \noffer here is an initial attempt at reincorporating the professional into the \nstudy of PSFs through a selective case study of law that highlights some of \nthe main issues in need of further consideration.   \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to Jon Beaverstock for comments on an earlier version of this paper. \nVersions of the paper were also presented at the 2006 Annual Conference of the \nClifford Chance Centre for the Study of Professional Service Firms in Barcelona \nand the 18th Annual SASE Meeting in Trier, Germany.
