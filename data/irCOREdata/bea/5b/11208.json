The substorm associated behavior of the low en-\nergy particles (30 eV\u201328.5 keV) near the earthward edge of\nthe plasma sheet is examined using data from CRRES during\nthe late growth and early expansion phases of a substorm on\n12 March 1991 and their significance for the substorm on-\nset mechanism is discussed. In this substorm, the CRRES\nwas located on L \u223c6.3 and \u223c20\u25e6 westward of the substorm\nonset and observed the sequence of the alternating bursts of\nthe low energy ions and electrons. The bursts of the 0.633\u2013\n9.6 keV ions occurred 1\u20132 min before the (7.31\u201321.7 keV)\nelectron bursts. The first ion burst happened 2 min before the\nsubstorm onset, at the moment of weak brightening of the\nmost equatorial pre-breakup arc near the latitude \u223c62\u25e6. The\nalternation of the ion and electron bursts may be a signature\nof a drift-Alfve\u00b4n ballooning instability on the inner edge of\nthe plasma sheet near substorm onset.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (Auroral phenomena;\nEnergetic particles, precipitating; Magnetospheric configu-\nration and dynamics)\n1 Introduction\nInjections of energetic particles and dipolarization of the\nmagnetic field are well-known signatures of the magneto-\nspheric substorm in the near-Earth region of the plasma\nsheet. Dipolarization has been interpreted as the reduction\nof a portion of the cross-tail current (current disruption) and\nthe formation of a substorm current wedge (McPherron et al.,\n1973). Two basic models of substorm onset have been sug-\ngested: i) the near-Earth current disruption (NECD) in the\nregion of the inner plasma sheet at the distance \u226410RE (e.g.\nLui, 1991) and ii) the near-Earth neutral line (NENL) at the\ndistance of 15\u201320RE (e.g. Baker et al., 1996).\nCorrespondence to: T. V. Kozelova\n(kozelova@pgi.kolasc.net.ru)\nFrom the ground-based observations, the substorm expan-\nsion phase onset is recognized by the sharp decrease of the\nX component in magnetometer records near the magnetic\nmidnight and by the breakup of the most equatorial arc. It\nwas found in some events that the source region of the arc in\nthe magnetosphere is located in the inner part of the plasma\nsheet, which is situated earthward of the open-closed field\nline boundary (Samson et al., 1992; Mende et al., 2003;\nDubyagin et al., 2003; Yago et al., 2005). Using various\nglobal magnetic field models, the locations of the auroral\nonset were mapped to equatorial distances in the range of\n5\u20138RE (Galperin and Feldstein, 1991; Lopez et al., 1991;\nFrank and Sigwarth, 2000; Dubyagin et al., 2003). On the\nother hand, in order to identify the onset region in the mag-\nnetosphere, auroral particles associated with substorm onset\nwere investigated.\nThe breakup location relative to the different precipitation\nboundaries was found using the low altitude satellite obser-\nvations:\n1. The pre-breakup arc near 20\u201324 MLT is found to corre-\nspond to the structure of precipitated electrons with the\nnarrow energy peak of 1\u20132 keV or of\u223c3 keV (Dubyagin\net al., 2003; Yago et al., 2005).\n2. This structure of precipitated electrons with the narrow\nenergy peak is located near the equatorial edge of the\ndiffuse electron precipitation region (Dubyagin et al.,\n2003; Yago et al., 2005). In this equatorward portion\nof the auroral precipitation, the average energy of the\nelectrons Ee increases towards a higher \u03bb \u2013 latitude,\ndEe\/d\u03bb>0 (Newell et al., 1996a, b).\n3. This electron precipitation structure, which corresponds\nto a brightening arc, is located about 0.4\u20131 degree pole-\nward of the greatest ion (0.01\u201324 keV) energy flux loca-\ntion (Dubyagin et al., 2003; Yago et al., 2005). The ion\nflux maximum matches the boundary \u201cb2i\u201d (Newell et\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1958 T. V. Kozelova et al.: Alternating bursts of low energy ions and electrons near the substorm onset\nFig. 1. Locations of ground-based magnetometers and the CRRES\nmapping to the ionosphere at 1-h interval, 20:00\u201321:00 UT, during\nthe substorm on 12 March 1991.\nal., 1996a, b) or the isotropy boundary (Sergeev et al.,\n1993). The temperature and energy flux of the ions in\nthe range 3 keV to 30 keV increase with declining lati-\ntude (Newell et al., 1996a, b).\nThus, the location of the brightened arc mapped to the equa-\ntorial plane is expected to correspond to a region in the mag-\nnetosphere where (a) the average energy of the electrons Ee\nincreases and (b) the ion energy density rapidly decreases\nwith increasing radial distances. The feature (a) is com-\nmonly interpreted as a characteristic of the Alfve\u00b4n convective\nboundary for hot electrons (on the inner edge of the plasma\nsheet). The feature (b) indicates the outer boundary of the\ntrapped energetic ions. The motions of these particle bound-\naries are observed most frequently during the substorm at\ngeosynchronous orbit in the region near midnight (Kaye and\nKivelson, 1979; Walker et al., 1976; Sauvaud and Winckler,\n1980).\nOn the other hand, the current disruptions during the sub-\nstorm onsets were recognized at the equatorial distances\nof 5\u201310RE in the magnetosphere (Lui, 1978; Kaufmann,\n1987; Kozelova and Sakharov, 1989; Jacquey et al., 1991;\nKozelova et al., 1999). Therefore, satellites at geosyn-\nchronous distances have, during sufficient magnetospheric\nactivity, a good possibility of registering the particle fluxes\nand magnetic field variations associated with substorm on-\nset plasma instabilities in the pre-midnight sector. An in-\nterchange\/ballooning instability appears consistent with the\nnear-geosynchronous observations of the substorm onset\n(Roux, 1985; Kremser et al., 1988; Samson et al., 1992).\nTable 1.

Localized field-aligned\ncurrent structures were found to coincide with the westward\ntravelling surge (WTS) and discrete auroral form. Kozelova\net al. (1986a, b) found in the study of the GEOS-2 data that\ni) the increase of the energetic electron fluxes, ii) the de-\ncrease of the energetic ion fluxes, iii) the sharp change in the\nazimuthal electric field component from eastward to west-\nward, and iv) the magnetic field dipolarization, are all con-\nnected with the western edge of the WTS. Holter et al. (1995)\nperformed spectral and wavelet analyses to characterize the\ntransient oscillations during the substorm. They interpreted\nthe obtained low frequency oscillations as a coupled shear\nAlfve\u00b4n-slow magnetosonic mode. These oscillations may\nbe excited by the ballooning instability (Miura et al., 1989;\nCheng and Qian, 1994).\nThe CRRES observations at 5\u20136.6RE also support an idea\nthat the drift-Alfve\u00b4n ballooning instability in the near-\ngeosynchronous plasma sheet is a responsible mechanism for\nsubstorm onset and initiation of the substorm current wedge\n(Maynard et al., 1996; Erickson et al., 2000; Kozelova et al.,\n2000). Maynard et al. (1996) presented the observation of the\nelectric field reversals that correlated with changes in cross-\ntail currents and particle energies occurring before and dur-\ning the substorm onset at the inner edge of the plasma sheet\nat 5\u20136RE . Erickson et al. (2000) found that the initial wave\npower is dominantly magnetical field aligned and flows to-\nwards the ionosphere during eastward oriented electric field.\nAt this time, the drift wave is coupled with the Alfve\u00b4n mode.\nJust before the local substorm dipolarization onset, Kozelova\net al. (2000) observed one oscillation with an \u223c90\u25e6 phase\nshift between Ey and Bz. The observed time lag between Bz\nandEy indicated the even mode standing wave structure with\nthe compressional component.\nAnn.

After 19:50 UT, the southward drifting weak auro-\nral arcs arose near the KIL meridian (3\u223c117\u25e6). Auroral\nactivations are observed in a more poleward region of au-\nroral particle precipitation and may be interpreted as auroral\npseudo-breakups.\nFigure 2 shows several ASC images borrowed from SOD,\nMUO, and KIL.

At this time, OUL, NOR and FAR were\nlocated in the region of the eastward electrojet, equatorward\nand westward of the Harang discontinuity. From the ground-\nbased observations, a general evolution of this substorm was\noriginally reported by Kozelova et al. (2004).\nThe first decrease in the X component of the magnetic field\nat the ground began at 20:22 UT at the station PEL (latitude\n\u03d5=63\u25e6). The X component decrease was small until To, when\nthe rate of decrease of the X component suddenly increased.\nThis was the first substorm intensification, which had a small\npoleward expansion (to MUO and KIL). Besides, at To, the\nsubstorm westward electrojet JW appears suddenly westward\nof the CRRES on the FAR meridian (3=80\u25e6). However,\n3 min later, this substorm intensification recovered, and the\nglobal current system with eastward electrojet was reestab-\nlished on the FAR. At 20:29\u201320:30 UT new substorm inten-\nsification started again near the KIL meridian. This intensi-\nfication had a significant equatorward expansion (to OUL).\nThe regular westward expansion of the substorm westward\nelectrojet JW was observed after 20:33 UT, during the next\nintensification, and the equatorward expansion of the mag-\nnetic activity began near NOR (Harang discontinuity moved\nwestward). This moment Texp=20:33 UT was important in\nthe dynamics of the inner magnetosphere.\nThus, before To CRRES hits the eastward electrojet re-\ngion and encounters the region 2 field-aligned currents flow-\ning into the ionosphere in the pre-Harang discontinuity sec-\ntor (Iijima and Potemra, 1978). The westward expansion of\nthe JW can be identified as a transition of the CRRES from\nthe pre-Harang discontinuity to the post-Harang discontinu-\nity sector, where the region 2 field-aligned currents flow from\nthe ionosphere.\nAnn.

Kozelova et al.: Alternating bursts of low energy ions and electrons near the substorm onset 1961\n3 Behavior of the low energy ions\nFigure 4 shows the Z component of the magnetic field (Bz),\nLEPA (with 15-s time resolution) and EPAS (with 30-s time\nresolution) ion data in several channels from the CRRES. In\nthe interval between t1 and Texp, the Bz component has a\nslow variation in a hollow form. Besides, some small-scale\nmagnetic field fluctuations appear after \u223cTo. Usually dur-\ning the substorm growth phase at near-geosynchronous dis-\ntances, the Bz decrease represents magnetic field line stretch-\ning. The Bz increase (dipolarization) begins after substorm\nonset during a substorm expansion phase. We begin our anal-\nysis from variations of the low energy ions with the pitch\nangle \u223c90\u25e6 during a hollow-like magnetic field variation.\n3.1 Slow variation of the ion flux\nDuring the growth phase stretching of the magnetic field\nlines on the CRRES (from t1 to To), the flux of ions with\npitch-angles \u223c90\u25e6 was increasing in the energy range from\nWL=0.28 keV to WH=7.31 keV. We will name these particles\nas population \u201cA\u201d. The ion flux in some energy channels from\nthis population is shown in panels 2 and 3 of Fig. 4. One can\nsee that the flux of 2.47\u20133.24 keV ions increases earlier than\nthat of the 0.633\u20130.831 keV ions. This dependence of the en-\nhanced ion flux on energy during the passage into the inner\nedge of the plasma sheet results in a \u201cnose\u201d distribution in\nthe ion spectrogram (Kerns et al., 1994). The energy WL is\na low-cutoff energy below which the drift paths are closed\nand eastward. The energy WH is a high-cutoff energy above\nwhich the drift paths are closed and westward (Kerns et al.,\n1994). The ions with the energy WL<W<WH convect from\nthe tail to the CRRES position.\nDuring the same interval of time, the flux of ions decreases\nin the energy range from 9.6 keV to 21.7 keV. We will name\nthese particles as population \u201cB\u201d. For example, the particle\nflux for two energy channels from this population is shown\nin panels 4 and 5 of Fig. 4. One can see that the flux of\nhigher-energy ions from this population begins to decrease\nearlier than the lower-energy ions. The decrease of the par-\nticles flux is usually observed at the outer radiation belt dur-\ning the growth phase distortion of the magnetosphere to a\nmore tail-like configuration (Walker et al., 1976; Sauvaud\nand Winckler, 1980).\nThus, different behavior of different energy particles near\nthe inner edge of the plasma sheet during the development of\nthe tail-like magnetic field in the vicinity of the CRRES can\nseparate the distinctive plasma regions and reveal the forma-\ntion of a sharp transition between these regions. The \u201cA\u201d\npopulation is probably associated with the inner boundary of\nthe plasma sheet with the outward (tailward) radial gradient\nof particle flux. The \u201cB\u201d population can be associated with\na population of \u201cold\u201d trapped ions from the outer boundary\nof trapped particles with an inward (earthwards) radial gra-\ndient of particle flux. During the growth phase, this transi-\ntion boundary moves earthwards. After To, population \u201cA\u201d\ndecreases and population \u201cB\u201d increases at the CRRES po-\nsition. Both populations are decreasing after Texp, when a\nlarge-scale dipolarization of the magnetic field occurs, and\nthe transition boundary is moving tailwards.\n3.2 Ion bursts\nWe want to pay attention to the low-energy (0.633\u20139.6 keV)\nion bursts that were observed \u223c100 s before To and Texp.\nThese bursts are marked as \u201ca\u201d and \u201ce\u201d in Fig. 4. Besides,\none can see a weak burst \u201cc\u201d at nearly 20:29 UT between the\nbursts \u201ca\u201d and \u201ce\u201d. These three ion bursts with the time dura-\ntion of \u223c100 s were observed with a quasi-period of 3.5 min.\nThe first ion burst coincides with the sudden enhancement\nof more energetic (54\u2013147 keV) ion fluxes with pitch-angles\n\u223c90\u25e6. Simultaneously, the pitch-angle distribution of these\nenergetic ions changes rapidly from the cigar form to the\ntrapped one (Lazutin et al., 2005). The energetic ion flux\nmesurements (EPAS data) in the four energy channels with a\ntime resolution of 30 s are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4.\nFor all energy channels (54\u2013147 keV), the flux increase starts\nat nearly 20:24 UT. However, for the first energy channel\n(54\u201369 keV), a more significant increase of the flux appears\nwith a delay of \u223c30 s, which is comparable to the time reso-\nlution of the data. The ion flux enhancement is the largest for\nthe energy channel (69\u201385 keV). EPAS ion data with a higher\ntime resolution from three detectors (presented in Lazutin et\nal., 2005) confirm that the ion flux enhancement near 20:24\nUT is \u201cnearly dispersionless\u201d or, more precisely, \u201cdispersion-\nless with a time resolution of 30 s\u201d.\nThe first low energy ion burst and a sudden energetic ion\nenhancement occurred \u223c2 min before To and coincided with\nthe appearance of the most equatorial weak arc near the lati-\ntude \u03d5=\u223c62\u25e6 observed roughly 20\u25e6 eastward of CRRES.\n4 Plasma sheet electron dynamics\nFigure 5 presents differential flux variations in several elec-\ntron channels of LEPA data with a 30-s time resolution.

Similar to ion flux variations, the electron\nfluxes, which increase during the growth phase stretching of\nthe magnetic field lines, will be named as population \u201cA\u201d.\nBefore To, the electron flux increases in the energy range\nfrom 0.213 keV to WC=1.88 keV.

The cutoff energy WC is con-\nsidered transition energy between the open and closed drift\ntrajectories of the electrons (Kerns et al., 1994). Just before\nTo, the electrons with W\u2264WC convect toward the CRRES\nposition from the tail.\nDuring the same time interval before To, the perpendicular\nflux of electrons with energies W>WC is almost constant or\nis decreasing. The electron flux is almost constant in the en-\nergy range from 2.47 keV to 5.57 keV (panel 3 of Fig. 5). The\nelectron flux decreases in the energy range from 7.31 keV to\n16.5 keV (panel 4 of Fig. 5).\nAccording to Kerns et al. (1994), electrons with W>WC\nmove by closed drift paths. The electron fluxes, which de-\ncrease or are almost constant during the growth phase, will be\nnamed \u201cB\u201d population. We observe in panel 4 of Fig. 5 that\nthe perpendicular flux of the higher-energy (12.6\u201316.5 keV)\nelectrons in this population begins to decrease earlier than\nthe flux of the lower-energy (7.31\u20139.6 keV) particles similar\nto the behavior of particles on the outer boundary of the \u201cold\u201d\ntrapped particles during the inward motion of the boundary\n(Walker et al., 1976; Sauvaud and Winckler, 1980).\nBefore To, for the electron energy interval (7.31\u201316.5 keV)\nthe flux exhibits the minimum for pitch angles around 90\u25e6.\nAfter Texp, \u201cA\u201d population is decreased and \u201cB\u201d population\nis increased.\n4.2 Injections of electrons\nAt \u223cTo, the electron flux in four adjacent energy channels\nin the range (7.31\u201316.5 keV) grows sharply and exceeds the\nlevel which it had before the beginning of the growth phase\nstretching of the magnetic field lines. One could call these in-\ncreases \u201cinjections\u201d of electrons in a small range of electron\nenergy. The first electron injection begins \u223c40 s before sig-\nnificant increases of the Z component of the magnetic field.\nThe second injection of 21.7\u201328.5 keV electrons occurrs at\n\u223cTexp, during the substorm expansion phase.\nAnn.

Kozelova et al.: Alternating bursts of low energy ions and electrons near the substorm onset 1963\n4.3 Electron bursts\nDuring the interval between To and Texp, one can see two\nelectron bursts, marked \u201cb\u201d and \u201cd\u201d in Fig. 5. Their time\nduration was \u223c100 s. Note the third burst, \u201cf\u201d, with an\nindistinct duration, masked by the electron injection. The\nbursts had little increases of both perpendicular and parallel\nfluxes of electrons with energies of 2.47\u20135.57 keV (panel 3\nof Fig. 5), which are close to the cut-off energy WC . More\nintensive electron bursts were observed in the higher-energy\nchannels of the \u201cB\u201d population, where the electron flux was\ndecreasing during the substorm growth phase (the bottom\npanel of Fig. 5). After the first burst, the electron flux in\nthe range (7.31\u201312.6 keV) exceeds the level which it had be-\nfore the beginning of the substorm growth phase, after the\nsecond burst \u2013 in the range (16.5\u201321.7) keV. After the third\nburst, the flux of electrons with energies >28.5 keV exceeds\nits initial value. The bursts occurred at the leading edge of\nelectron injections. During these electron (2.47\u201312.6 keV)\nbursts, the flux of electrons (of \u201cA\u201d population) with energies\nof 0.213\u20131.88 keV decreases (panel 1 of Fig. 5).\n4.4 Parallel fluxes of electrons\nBefore To, the parallel flux J || (dashed lines, Fig. 5) of\npopulation \u201cA\u201d electrons with W\u22641.88 keV was slowly in-\ncreasing, similar to the perpendicular fluxes. As the satellite\ncrosses the inner edge of the plasma sheet, the average en-\nergy of the electrons, Ee, is increasing with the increase of\nthe radial distance, r , so that dEe\/dr>0. These fluxes J ||\nmay be associated with the equatorial edge of the diffuse au-\nroral electron precipitation in the ionosphere, where the aver-\nage energy of Ee is increasing with the latitude \u03bb, providing\ndEe\/d\u03bb>0 (Newell et al., 1996a,b).\n5 Alternation of ion and electron bursts\nNow it is possible to compare the development of ion and\nelectron bursts and simultaneous variations of the magnetic\nfield at the CRRES during the substorm on 12 March 1991\n(Fig. 6). Panel 1 of Fig. 6 presents the sliding 60-s smoothed\nvalues of the magnetic field Z component, <Bz>, to demon-\nstrate slow changes in the field.

Panels 5 and 6 present elec-\ntron fluxes of several energy channels as in Fig. 5.\nFrom Fig. 6, one can see that the ion bursts occur 1\u20132 min\nbefore the electron bursts. The ion bursts occurred without\nsignificant fluctuations in dBt , and a dependence of the ion\nbursts on changes in <Bz> was not observed. The elec-\ntron bursts occurred during small local dipolarizations, with\nthe accompanying increase of the magnetic field fluctuations,\nwith a quasi-period of \u223c40\u201360 s.\n<Bz>, nT\ndBt, nT\nIONS\nIONS\nELECTRONS\nELECTRONS\n0.633 keV\n0.831 keV\n1.43 keV\n1.88 keV\n3.24 keV\n4.25 keV\n7.31 keV\n12.6 keV 16.5 keV\n28.5 keV\na c e\nb\nd f\nFig. 6. The alternation of the low-energy ion and electron bursts\nduring the substorm on 12 March 1991.\nThe electric field measurements (with 30-s time resolu-\ntion) during this substorm were presented earlier in Lazutin\net al. (2005). Before To, the electric field was very small.\nImpulsive enhancements in the electric field were detected,\nstarting at 20:26 UT (Lazutin et al., 2005). After\u223c20:31 UT,\nthe CRRES electric field cannot be used due to the spacecraft\npotential becoming too large and driving the sensor\u2019s pream-\nplifiers into saturation. During the interval 20:26\u201320:31 UT,\nthe electric field is nearly zero (in average) and has variations\nwith a period of \u223c2 min. We cannot confidently separate the\nvariations with the period of \u223c2 min in particle flux data;\ntherefore, we don\u2019t present the electric field data here.\nLower-frequency oscillations with a period of \u223c3\u20134 min,\nwhich we observe for particle bursts, are also not seen in\nelectric field. If these oscillations are the same long-period\noscillations as in Holter et al. (1995), then they have \u201ca sec-\nond harmonic standing wave structure along the magnetic\nfield line and develop as a coupled shear Alfve\u00b4n-slow mag-\nnetosonic mode\u201d (Holter et al., 1995). The second harmonic\nstanding wave structure has zero value of the azimuthal elec-\ntric field at the equatorial plane, where the CRRES satellite\nwas located during considered event. This is a possible ex-\nplanation for the lack of the electric field oscillations.\n6 Discussion\nThe CRRES observation of the substorm on 12 March 1991,\nwhen the satellite was located near the inner edge of the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1957\/2006\/ Ann.

The sequence of low-energy particle bursts observed at\nthe CRRES may be a signature of an instability of the sharp\ntransition boundary between different particle populations.\nBelow, we discuss and compare our results with other obser-\nvations.\n6.1 Transition region near the inner edge of the plasma\nsheet\nIt is known that the position of the inner edge of the plasma\nsheet depends on the cross-tail electric field. Lower-energy\nelectrons come closer to the Earth. When the convection\nelectric field increases (for example, during the substorm\ngrowth phase) and\/or a satellite is moving across the inner\nedge of the plasma sheet with the radial tailward gradient of\nparticles, the satellite crosses the boundary for one energy of\nparticles after another and the fluxes of the pertinent electron\nenergies will increase. In our case, the same features charac-\nterized population \u201cA\u201d, which contained the electrons of the\nenergies W\u22641.88 keV. But the inward displacement of the\ndrift orbits causes a decrease in the particle flux at the con-\nstant energy for the particle population, which has the radial\ngradient directed toward the Earth, as on the outer bound-\nary of trapped particles (Walker et al., 1976; Sauvaud and\nWinckler, 1980). In our case, before the To, the flux of ions\nwith energies 9.6\u201321.7 keV and electrons with the energies\n7.31\u201316.5 keV are decreasing. These trapped particles are\n\u201cB\u201d population in our notation.\nThus, during the substorm growth phase, the CRRES tra-\nverses the magnetosphere region where the average energy\nof the low-energy (\u22641.88 keV) electrons is increasing and the\ndensity of the ions with W>9.6 keV is decreasing with grow-\ning radial distances. The variations of the parallel fluxes J ||\n(dashed lines, Fig. 5) of electrons with W\u22641.88 keV in pop-\nulation \u201cA\u201d may manifest that the CRRES position is associ-\nated with the equatorial edge of the diffuse auroral electron\nprecipitation in the ionosphere. The average energy of the\nelectrons Ee is increasing with latitude \u03bb, so that dEe\/d\u03bb>0\n(Newell et al., 1996a, b).\nWhen the tail stretching proceeds during the substorm\ngrowth phase, both the inner edge of the plasma sheet and the\nouter edge of the stable trapped particles steepen and the CR-\nRES observes the formation of the transition boundary be-\ntween different particle populations with different magnetic\nfield flux tubes at \u223c6.3RE . This boundary may be unstable\nto westward travelling perturbations (Roux et al., 1991).\nThe anticorrelation between the ion and electron bursts,\nfound in the investigated substorm on 12 March 1991, is con-\nsistent with a schematic development of a drift-Alfve\u00b4n bal-\nlooning instability at the sharp boundary between \u201cdipole\u201d\nand \u201ctail-like\u201d magnetic field (Roux, 1985; Roux et al.,\n1991). At the near-geosynchronous distance, the gradient of\nplasma pressure and the gradient of the magnetic field are\noriented in the same direction (earthward). This situation is\npotentially unstable to the so-called ballooning modes. Ener-\ngetic ions and electrons, owing to their westward and east-\nward drifts, respectively, provide charge separation within\nthe perturbated region with the higher plasma pressure. In-\ntense auroral forms and WTS associated with enhanced elec-\ntron precipitation should map to the position where nega-\ntive charges tend to prevail (Roux, 1985; Kozelova et al.,\n1986a,b). This disturbance propagates azimuthally as the\ndrift-Alfve\u00b4n ballooning wave with k\u22a5\u001dk|| . The disturbance\nmay persist for 1\u20132, or even only a half of the wave period\nand then decays. However, a sharp front of energetic ions\nmay support the development of this disturbance.\n6.2 Oscillations associated with a sharp front of energetic\nions\nThe drift-wave resonance of magnetic field lines may be ex-\ncited by the azimuthal drift of protons when a sharp gradient\nof the particle flux occurs in the direction of the gradient-B\ndrift (Cladis, 1971). Cladis (1971) showed that the field lines\noscillate as standing waves in the meridional plane and form\na wave pattern in the azimuthal direction that moves with the\nphase velocity equal to the mean azimuthal drift velocity of\nthe particles.\nFigure 7 contains a schema of the magnetic field lines\u2019\nconfiguration for the drift-wave resonance pattern. This pic-\nture is adopted from Fig. 3 of Cladis (1971). In this figure,\nmagnetic field lines that were originally at the same L-shell\nare shown in their displaced positions (a wave-like line in\nthe equatorial plane, as viewed from above the north pole).\nAccording to Cladis (1971), the field lines that are instan-\ntaneously at the minimum displacement positions (\u201ca\u201d, \u201cc\u201d\nand \u201ce\u201d) contain the maximum positive charge. Those lines\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1957\u20131968, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1957\/2006\/\nT. V. Kozelova et al.: Alternating bursts of low energy ions and electrons near the substorm onset 1965\nwhich are instantaneously at maximum displacement posi-\ntions (\u201cb\u201d, \u201cd\u201d, etc.) contain the maximum negative charge.\nNow it is possible to compare the sequence of the al-\nternating bursts of the low-energy ions and electrons that\nare observed during the substorm on 12 March 1991 with\nthe pattern in Fig. 7. A wave-like line on the equatorial\nplane presents the sharp transition boundary between the re-\ngions with different characteristics of plasma and magnetic\nfield. The more dipolar-like magnetic field lines with pop-\nulation \u201cB\u201d are located in the earthward side of this bound-\nary, whereas the tail-like magnetic field lines with popula-\ntion \u201cA\u201d are located in the tailward side of this boundary.\nThe front of the energetic particles is observed at the more\ntail-like magnetic field configuration, and the maximum of\nthe first burst of electrons occured at more dipolar magnetic\nfield lines. The observed ion bursts \u201ca\u201d, \u201cc\u201d, and \u201ce\u201d corre-\nspond to the regions with the positive charge, and the elec-\ntron bursts \u201cb\u201d, \u201cd\u201d, and \u201cf\u201d correspond to the regions with\nthe negative charge. During electron (2.47\u201312.6 keV) bursts,\nthe flux of electrons with energies of 0.213\u20131.88 keV (popu-\nlation \u201cA\u201d) decreases (panel 1 of Fig. 5). This anticorrelation\nof the electron fluxes from different populations is consistent\nwith transitions of a boundary between regions with different\npopulations (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d).\nWhile the flux of the population \u201cA\u201d ions abruptly de-\ncreases during the trailing edge of the first burst, the fluxes\nof the population \u201cB\u201d ions increase. This behaviour of the\nparticle fluxes is consistent with a transition from a tail-like\nmagnetic field region towards a more dipolar magnetic field\nregion (between the points \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d at Fig. 7). We can\ninterprete all these transitions as a spatial effect associated\nwith the crossings of the transition boundary. Thus, when\nthe wave structure shown in Fig. 7 is passing the satellite, the\nsatellite observes a sequence of the alternating bursts of the\nlow energy ions and electrons.\nDuring the considered event, the oscillations were stim-\nulated by the dispersionless (with a resolution of 30 s) in-\njection of ions with the energy of 54\u2013147 keV. This ion in-\njection coincides with the appearance of the most equato-\nrial weak arc, which was observed \u223c2 min after the pseudo-\nbreakup \u201cpb2\u201d (Fig. 3) and \u223c2 min before To and roughly\n20\u25e6 eastward of the CRRES. Let us assume that: i) the region\nof pseudobreakup \u201cpb2\u201d (which occurrs during \u223c20:21\u2013\n20:23 UT) has a westward expansion with a velocity of about\n\u223c7.7\u25e6\/min, as it was obtained for a substorm expansion in\nHolter et al. (2004); ii) this velocity is constant during a few\nminutes; and iii) the CRRES was located \u223c20\u25e6 westward of\nthe \u201cpb2\u201d onset epicenter. Then, the first indication of the\napproaching pseudo-breakup \u201cpb2\u201d will appear at CRRES at\n\u223c20:23:30 UT, nearly simultaneously with the high energy\nion injection. Although these moments coincide, the lack of\ndispersion (or a very small dispersion) during the ion injec-\ntion is evidence of a local acceleration of the ions.\nThe beginning of the ground magnetic field disturbance at\nthe meridian of FAR (\u223c15\u25e6 westward of the CRRES) that\nwas observed 2 min after the ion injection onset may be as-\nsociated with the arrival of the westward drifting ions from\nthe CRRES toward the meridian of FAR.\nNote that pseudo-breakups in the ionosphere, the appear-\nance of weak magnetic oscillation and the increase of ener-\ngetic ion flux in the magnetosphere, occurring before To, may\ntestify that the state of the magnetosphere was close to being\nmarginally stable just a few minutes before the moment To.\n6.3 Oscillations with a period of 40\u201360 s\nDuring the substorm of 12 March 1991, the higher-frequency\noscillations of the magnetic field, with a period of 40\u201360 s,\nwere observed during the electron bursts. Note that the elec-\ntron fluxes during the bursts are larger than the initial electron\nfluxes which occurred before the beginning of the magnetic\nfield line stretching. This fact may indicate that the transition\nboundary is moving tailward and local acceleration of parti-\ncles occurs. We suppose that the observed oscillations are\nprobably associated with the kinetic Alfve\u00b4n waves.\nThe importance of kinetic Alfve\u00b4n waves for the acceler-\nation and anomalous transport of the auroral particles was\ndiscussed by Hasegawa (1976), Hasegawa and Mima (1978)\nand Kremser et al. (1988). Kremser et al. (1988) reported on\nthe occurrence of bi-directional field-aligned beams of elec-\ntrons (16 keV\u2264E\u226480 keV) that were observed near the sub-\nstorm onset by the geosynchronous satellite GEOS 2. The\nbeams lasted for about 90 s (as the bursts) and appeared in the\nelectron pitch angle distributions as the intensity increased at\nthe start of pitch angles of about 20\u25e6 (or 160\u25e6) and peaked at\npitch angles of 0\u25e6 (or 180\u25e6). These field-aligned beams were\nassociated with strong increases in the perpendicular electron\nintensity. Besides, they coincided with strong spatial gradi-\nents of the ion intensity and fluctuations of the electric and\nmagnetic fields.\nKremser et al. (1988) considered a model for the beam\ngeneration that was based on theoretical investigations by\nHasegawa (1976). According to this model, these electron\nbeams may be the result of electron acceleration in the paral-\nlel electric field of kinetic Alfve\u00b4n waves.\nWe suppose that the electron bursts observed simultane-\nously with the magnetic field oscillations during the sub-\nstorm of 12 March 1991 may have a similar origin as the\nfield-aligned electron beams that were observed on GEOS 2\n(Kremser et al., 1988). However, in our event, the increase in\nthe flux of field-aligned particles was small. Here it should\nbe noted that before the substorm onset, the CRRES was lo-\ncated in the pre-Harang discontinuity sector, where the re-\ngion 2 field-aligned currents flow toward the ionosphere. It is\npossible that conditions in this region were not favorable for\na more pronounced evolution of the bursts toward the state of\nthe field-aligned electron beams as in Kremser et al. (1988).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1957\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 1957\u20131968, 2006\n1966 T. V. Kozelova et al.: Alternating bursts of low energy ions and electrons near the substorm onset\n6.4 Transition between two regimes of transport\nThe measurements of the bulk velocity in the plasma sheet\n(Angelopoulos et al., 1992; Borovsky et al., 1998) indicate\nthat there is a great scattering about the mean velocity. This\nwas interpreted as an evidence of the existence of the turbu-\nlent transport (Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1987; Antonova\nand Ovchinnikov, 1999).\nThe presence of the turbulence alters the conductivity and\nthe diffusion properties across the plasma sheet and may per-\nmit a cross-scale coupling of localized perturbations into a\nglobal perturbation. The transition between the two regimes\nof transport presents a burst-like process with the character-\nistic time of \u03c4\u226410 s and may correspond to auroral activa-\ntions and substorm onset (Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1987,\n1991).\nIn a quasi-steady state, particularly during the growth\nphase of substorm, the magnetosphere is in a quasi-steady\nstate with a quasi-static electric field driving a quasi-steady\nearthward convective flow. However, the transient bursts\nof fast flows were also observed in the plasma sheet (An-\ngelopoulos et al., 1992; Nakamura et al., 1994; Le Contel et\nal., 2001). The standard convection models, based on con-\nstant electrostatic fields, do not describe this regime of flows.\nLe Contel et al. (2001) showed that the level of the ULF\nfluctuations at the proton gyrofrequency seems to control the\ntransition between the two regimes of the plasma transport\nin the near-Earth plasma sheet: a slow transport during the\ngrowth phase and a fast transport during the active phase of\nthe substorm.\nImpulsive increases (as short lasting bursts) of these waves\nwere regularly observed at the GEOS 2 during the substorm\nmagnetic field dipolarization (Perraut et al., 1993, 2000; Le\nContel et al., 2001). These spatially localized waves are re-\nlated to field-aligned currents, Perraut et al. (2000) called\nthem the current-driven Alfve\u00b4n (CDA) waves. Bursts of\nCDA waves coincide with the increases in the flux of elec-\ntrons with energy >20 keV at pitch-angles \u223c90\u25e6 and, simul-\ntaneously, with the increases of low-energy (2.5\u20137 keV) elec-\ntron fluxes at pitch-angles <20\u25e6 (Perraut et al., 1993, 2000).\nAlso, the high-intensity CDA waves may isotropize and heat\nthe ions (Perraut et al., 1998).\nWe turn our attention to the substorm of 12 March 1991\nfrom these positions. Then the pseudo-breakups and slow\nvariations of the particles and the magnetic field occurred be-\nfore To became a signature of convective flow, as well as an\ninstability, which began to develop slowly. The dispersion-\nless enhancement of the energetic 54\u2013147 keV proton fluxes\nand the sequential sharp increase in the electron flux with the\nenergy of 7.32\u201312.6 keV may correspond to the transition be-\ntween the convective (laminar) and turbulent regimes of the\nplasma flows.\n7 Summary\nIn this study we examined the low-energy (30 eV\u201328.5 keV)\nparticle flux variations observed by the CRRES near the\nearthward edge of the plasma sheet at L \u223c6.3 and \u223c20\u25e6\nwestward the substorm onset during the substorm on 12\nMarch 1991. Some of the main results of the presented anal-\nysis are as follows:\n1. During the growth phase magnetic field stretch-\ning, the ion and electron flux variations depend on\nthe particle energies: the flux of low-energy (with\nW<Wc=1.88 keV) electrons and ions (0.28\u20137.31 keV)\nis increasing. These particles are convecting toward the\nCRRES from the tail. The flux of the higher-energy\nelectrons (7.31\u201316.5 keV) and ions (9.6\u201321.7 keV) is\ndecreasing. These particles are trapped on the closed\ndrift paths. These changes may imply that both the inner\nedge of plasma sheet and the outer boundary of higher-\nenergy \u201cold\u201d particles steepen. The transition region be-\ntween different particle populations of the plasma sheet,\ndipolar and tail-like flux tubes, narrowed and moved\nearthwards.\n2. The sequence of the alternating bursts of the low-energy\nions and electrons begins 2 min before the substorm on-\nset. The bursts of the ions (0.633\u20139.6 keV) had a time\nduration of 100\u2013120 s and a quasi-period of 3\u20134 min.\nThe ion bursts occurred 1\u20132 min before the electron\n(2.47\u201321.7 keV) bursts. The electron bursts were asso-\nciated with the small, local increase in the Bz compo-\nnent and in the magnetic field fluctuations.\n3. The beginning of the sequence of the low-energy parti-\ncles bursts coincides with the enhancement of the high-\nenergetic (54\u2013147 keV) ion flux. The enhancement of\nthe high-energetic ion flux happened at the moment of\na weak brightening of the most equatorial pre-breakup\narc near the latitude \u223c62\u25e6.\n4. Near the substorm onset, the substorm westward elec-\ntrojet, which is localized\u223c20\u25e6 westward of the CRRES,\nincreases sharply. Simultaneously, the first injection\nof electrons was observed in a narrow energy range of\n7.31\u201312.6 keV. This first electron injection began \u223c40 s\nbefore a significant increase in the Z component of the\nmagnetic field. The injection of higher-energy electrons\n(12.6\u201321.7 keV) was observed later, at the beginning of\na large substorm expansion.\nThe variations of the ion and electron bursts may be asso-\nciated with the multiple crossings of the transition boundary\n(discussed above) which has an oscillatory behavior. A sharp\ngradient of energetic ions in the direction of the gradient-\nB drift may excite the drift-wave resonance of the magnetic\nfield lines (Cladis, 1971) and support oscillations on the tran-\nsition boundary. Our analysis supports the idea about the\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1957\u20131968, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1957\/2006\/\nT. V.
