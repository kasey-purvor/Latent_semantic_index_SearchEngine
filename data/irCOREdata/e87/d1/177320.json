Pokrajac, C. Manes, and I. McEwan\nDepartment of Engineering, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, AB24 3UE, United Kingdom\n\u0001Received 17 February 2007; accepted 7 August 2007; published online 26 September 2007\u0002\nWe present the velocity profile measured within a porous bed below rough turbulent open channel\nflow. Mean streamwise velocity has a minimum in the top pore, just below the bed surface, and then\nincreases towards a constant value in the deeper pores. We argue that the velocity minimum in the\ntop pore is due to enhanced turbulence generated within the external flow. This produces a flow\nregime similar to rough turbulent pipe flow, with very efficient momentum extraction. In the deeper\npores turbulence intensities are damped so that momentum extraction is less efficient, allowing\nhigher mean velocities to develop. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics.\n\u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2780193\u0004\nFor fluid flowing over and inside a rough permeable bed,\nthe flow domain can be divided into a \u201cfree-stream\u201d region\nabove the bed and a subsurface region within it. Many stud-\nies have been carried out for the case of laminar subsurface\nflows.1\u20139 In contrast, due to experimental difficulties and\nhighly demanding computational costs, laboratory investiga-\ntions and numerical simulations of the turbulent flow inside\npermeable beds are very limited.10\u201313 This stimulated the au-\nthors to carry out a series of experiments designed to inves-\ntigate turbulence properties at the interface between turbulent\nopen channel flows and a porous bed. The internal geometry\nof the porous bed was chosen to allow velocity measure-\nments within its voids and to maintain acceptable similarity\nwith gravel beds of natural streams. For these purposes, the\nporous bed comprised uniform size spheres packed in cubic\narrangement with each successive layer of spheres placed\ndirectly on top of the preceding one.\nThis Brief Communication focuses on mean streamwise\nvelocity profiles measured within the bed. The profiles show\na peculiar velocity minimum just one bead diameter below\nthe bed surface. This was consistently found in all the ex-\nperiments by two independent measurement techniques. This\nresult is counterintuitive since one would expect mean ve-\nlocities to decrease uniformly within the bed due to the\nweakening of the shearing effect induced by the free-stream\nflow. In the following text we provide an explanation for this\nunexpected result.\nExperiments were conducted using an 11-m-long and\n0.4-m-wide tilting hydraulic flume with a rectangular cross\nsection. The permeable bed used in this study consisted of\nfive layers of 12-mm-diam glass spheres packed in a cubic\npattern. All experiments were carried out under uniform tur-\nbulent flow conditions. The main hydraulic parameters for\nthe experiments are shown in Table I. Velocities were mea-\nsured using an ultrasonic velocity profiler \u0001UVP\u0002 and particle\nimage velocimetry \u0001PIV\u0002.\nSubsurface velocities were measured by means of a\n4-MHz Met-Flow UVP probe \u0001Met-Flow SA 2000\u0002, which\nwas inserted in a hole drilled in the bed and oriented along\nthe flow, as shown in Fig. 1. In these experiments, the probe\nmeasured instantaneous velocities at 128 points within a\nlength of about 95 mm. Each measurement point corre-\nsponds to a disc-shaped sampling volume of 5-mm diam and\n0.74-mm thickness. The sampling volumes did not overlap.\nThe streamwise velocity component, u, was measured at\nseveral heights within the bed by moving the UVP probe to\nfour positions \u0001named pores 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 1\u0002. The\naccuracy of velocities measured with UVP is about\n0.8\u20131 mm\/s for all the experiments. Further details of the\nexperimental technique and the validation of its applicability\ninside this porous bed can be found in Manes et al.14\nPIV images were recorded by a KODAK ES1.0 digital\ncross-correlation camera using a double-pulsed Nd-Yag laser\nfor illumination and VidPIV analysis software for determining\nthe velocity vector field. The software applies a cross-\ncorrelation algorithm over regions of the flow called interro-\ngation areas. Average velocity in an interrogation area is cal-\nculated from the particle displacement found from the peaks\nin correlation function of the image gray-scale values. The\nsubpixel position of these peaks is detected using three-point\none-dimensional Gaussian fitting in two directions.\nFree-stream velocity measurements were carried out\nwith the laser placed in two central cross sections of the\nflume \u0001Fig. 2\u0002: one over the tops of the balls \u0001\u201cTop\u201d\u0002 and\nanother over their lateral connections \u0001\u201cValley\u201d\u0002. These two\nsections were chosen in order to capture the lateral heteroge-\nneity of the flow within the roughness layer, where the flow\nis directly influenced by the individual roughness elements.\nMean velocities were averaged over thin bed-parallel vol-\numes, covering both top and valley sections in width, one\nbead diameter in length, and the size of the interrogation\nareas \u00011.6 mm\u0002 in height.\nFor one flow condition \u000120H400s\u0002 PIV was also used for\nmeasurement of velocities inside pores 1 and 2 \u0001Fig. 2\u0002. In\nthis case it was only possible to have a single measurement\nwindow with the illuminated plane through the valley section\nbetween the spheres. Furthermore, only the middle part was\nvisible to the camera because the corners of the window were\nobstructed by the spheres.\nPIV measurement accuracy was estimated to be\n\u00050.0025 m\/s for the free-stream experiments and\n\u00050.0018 m\/s for the measurements within pores 1 and 2\nPHYSICS OF FLUIDS 19, 098109 \u00012007\u0002\n1070-6631\/2007\/19\u00019\u0002\/098109\/4\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics19, 098109-1\nDownloaded 02 Oct 2007 to 139.133.7.38.

The size of the interrogation area was \u00051.6 mm\nfor the free-stream measurements and \u00051.2 mm for pores 1\nand 2 experiments.\nFigure 3 shows the time-averaged streamwise velocities\nu\u00af obtained from UVP at different levels within the bed for\nexperiment 20H400s \u0001all other flow conditions show identi-\ncal features\u0002. Time-averaged velocities generally increase in\nthe narrower sections of the pores and decrease in the wider\nsections giving rise to the \u201cwavy\u201d profile in all pores.\nHowever, there are notable differences between pore 1\nand all other pores. The velocity in pore 1 is much smaller\nthan in the other three pores. The \u201cwaviness\u201d is much more\npronounced, indicating that fluid inside pore 1 conforms to\nthe pore geometry much more than in the other pores. Over a\nsingle wavelength velocity in pore 1 is symmetric, with ap-\nproximately equal converging and diverging sections,\nwhereas in the other pores there is asymmetry arising from a\nmuch shorter converging section in the flow.\nIn order to smooth the wavy spatial variability induced\nby the porous bed, mean velocities measured by the UVP in\neach pore were spatially averaged along their measurement\nlength to obtain double-averaged \u0001in time, then in space\u0002\nvelocities, denoted by \u0006u\u00af\u0007. The spatial averaging window\ncovered the flow region along the measurement axis between\n10 and 95 mm from the face of the transducer \u0001seven sphere\ndiameters, Fig. 3\u0002. The first 10 mm of each UVP measure-\nment window was neglected because the velocities in this\nregion were influenced by the presence of the transducer.\nDouble-averaged velocity profiles are shown in Fig. 4.\nIntuitively, one would expect that mean velocities within\nthe subsurface flow should gradually decrease within the bed\ndue to the weakening of the shearing effect induced by the\nfree-stream flow. Instead, mean velocities, \u0006u\u00af\u0007, in these ex-\nperiments show the opposite behavior: they first decrease\nreaching a minimum in pore 1 from where they start to in-\ncrease again creating an unexpected dip in the velocity pro-\nfile \u0003Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004. This peculiar result was tested by\nusing PIV to measure velocities in pores 1 and 2. A detailed\ndiscussion of the comparison between pore velocities mea-\nsured by UVP and PIV can be found in Manes et al.14 The\nPIV measurement confirmed that the velocities are indeed\nlower in pore 1 than in pore 2 \u0003Fig. 4\u0001c\u0002\u0004. This confirms that\nthe dip is not a measurement artifact but rather the effect of\nphysical mechanisms, which are discussed in the remaining\ntext.\nIn gravity-driven steady and uniform open channel\nflows, mean longitudinal velocities within the bed are deter-\nmined by the balance between the longitudinal component of\ngravity, the gradient of the fluid shear stress, and the drag the\nfluid exerts on the porous material, in this case uniform di-\nameter spheres.\nMean velocity profiles inside the bed indicate that the\neffect of fluid shear induced by the free stream vanishes at\nroughly the height of the first pore. In fact, mean velocities\nbelow this level seem to depend only on bed slope and not\non the free-stream hydraulic conditions \u0001i.e., flow depth\u0002.\nThis is further substantiated by the fact that Reynolds stress\nTABLE I.

In other words, all the pores have an approximately\nequal momentum supply. For the velocity dip to exist under\nsuch conditions drag forces in the higher pores must be more\nefficient in extracting fluid momentum, i.e., the drag coeffi-\ncient must be higher, than in the lower pores. This increase in\nthe drag coefficient is linked to the enhanced turbulence in-\ntensity close to the free stream. Figure 5\u0001a\u0002 shows that the\ncoefficient of variation of streamwise velocities \u0001spatially av-\neraged in the same manner as mean velocities\u0002 uniformly\ndecreases within the bed. Higher coefficients of variation\nindicate higher turbulence intensities, which in turn,\nimply higher drag coefficients and ultimately lower mean\nvelocities.\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Mean velocity profiles in the \u0001a\u0002 whole flow field and \u0001b\u0002 focused within the porous bed.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/pof.aip.org\/pof\/copyright.jsp\nThe phenomenon of the velocity dip can be explained if\nthe longitudinal pores are understood as small and very\nrough pipes. Enhanced turbulence in the upper pore means\nthat the fluid is mixed across the pore better, while in the\nlower pores the flow is concentrated in the middle of the\npore, i.e., it separates from the spheres soon after the narrow-\nest cross section. The spheres are closely packed so that the\nflow behind each individual sphere is intercepted by the next\none, hence creating the so-called \u201csheltering effect.\u201d In such\nsetup the region downstream from the separation point con-\ntains inactive, slowly spinning or completely stagnant fluid.\nWhen the separation point shifts downstream the stagnant\nfluid zone shrinks, exposing a bigger part of the sphere to\nfaster fluid flow through the central section of the pore,\nhence increasing the drag coefficient. A similar phenomenon\nhappens in rough pipes with uniform size roughness at the\ntransition between smooth and rough pipe flow. The drag\ncoefficient \u0001friction factor\u0002 rapidly increases when the rough-\nness elements start protruding through the top of the viscous\nsublayer. Thus, the top pore in our experiment can be de-\nscribed as hydraulically rough, while the lowest pores are\nhydraulically smooth. In terms of momentum balance, grav-\nity is balanced mainly by form drag in the upper pores and\nmainly by viscous drag in the lower pores. Being less effi-\ncient in extracting momentum than form drag, viscous drag\nallows the fluid to develop higher velocities in the lower\npores.\nA specific feature of the flow inside the pores, and one\nwhich makes it different from conventional pipe flow, is that\nthe turbulence responsible for changing the flow regime and\nhence enhancing drag originates in the external free-stream\nflow \u0001Manes15 and Voellmer et al.13\u0002. Despite negligible net\nturbulent momentum transfer, externally generated turbulent\nkinetic energy penetrates into the top pore. This makes it\npossible to have rough turbulent flow at lower velocities and\nsmooth turbulent flow at higher velocities. This is contrary to\nwhat happens in conventional pipe flow, where the turbu-\nlence is generated inside the pipe.\nThe velocity profile discussed in this Brief Communica-\ntion is somewhat similar to that observed within plant cano-\npies by Shaw,16 who found a velocity dip at the canopy\ncrown and the secondary maximum at the bottom of the\ncanopy. The shape of the canopy velocity profile is also due\nto a change in drag coefficients between the canopy crown\nand trunk regions, but caused by a change in geometry:\nbranches and foliage of the crown provide more efficient\nblockage to air movement than the trunk. Our experimental\nresults now show that the velocity dip can also occur in\nhomogeneous porous materials.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a peculiar velocity pro-\nfile for turbulent open channel flows inside a rough perme-\nable bed, such that the minimum velocity occurs in the pore\nclosest to the free stream. It was observed that the transport\nof free-stream momentum is negligible within the pores and\nhence the momentum exchange is characterized by the bal-\nance of the gravity and drag forces. Momentum extraction by\ndrag is most efficient in the top pore, which is connected to\nthe external flow. This is the result of the enhanced turbu-\nlence in that pore, which causes a flow regime similar to\nrough pipe flow, such that the form drag is the dominant\nmechanism of momentum extraction. Due to the turbulence\nintensity damping within the bed, the flow regime becomes\ncloser to smooth pipe flow so that the drag coefficients de-\ncrease as the viscous drag becomes the more dominant part\nof the total drag. Being less efficient than form drag in ex-\ntracting momentum from the flow, viscous drag allows\nhigher mean velocities to develop in the lower pores. This is\ncontrary to conventional pipe flow, where higher turbulence\nintensities occur at higher velocity, but still possible, because\nthe turbulence that dictates the flow regime is generated\nwithin the external flow and not within the \u201cpipe.\u201d\n1G.
