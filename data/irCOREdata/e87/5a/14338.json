The project entailed the\nreplacement of two of a series of nine scheduled lectures with a computer-based tutorial. The\ntwo main aims of the project were to test the viability of converting existing lecture material\ninto computer-based material on an in-house production basis, and to obtain feedback from the\nstudent cohort on their behavioural response to the change in media. The effect on student\nperformance was not measured at this stage of development.\nDescription of the courseware\nWindows Help Author was used to create a set of tutorial files on the subject of payment under\nstandard forms of contract in the construction industry. The files were created in hypertext\nstyle to allow the students to navigate through the material as they wished, although a\nsuggested route was provided which mirrored the approach taken in a normal lecture. The\ncomputer-based material deliberately replicated that which would have been available via the\ntwo normal lectures in order not to distort the comparison between the two modes of delivery,\nalthough some of the group interactions in normal lectures were postponed until a subsequent\nseminar. A total of 22 windows were produced, an example of which is shown in Figure 1.\nBlue or red hot words were used to guide students to further windows or pop-ups respectively,\ntaking account of published screen design principles (Clarke, 1992).\nAdvantages to the lecturer in using Help Author included the negligible expense of the\n99\nDerek Love\/Je Replacement of traditional lectures with computer-based tutorials: a case study\nInterim Payments Ml 3 Interim Valuation\nEile \u00a3dit Bookmark Help\nfipntenbt P\nThe usual monthly cycle of valuation \/\ncertificate \/payment is described in\nclause 42 and is illustrated below.\n(Click on any of the coloured topics or phrases for\nfurther information)\nInterim valuation\n7 days\nInterim certificate\nI\"days\nPayment\nThis cycle is repeated until Practica\nCompletion occurs\nIt is normally the QS -who ascertains\nthe amount of payment The total\namount of a valuation will comprise:\nA: Amounts subject to retention\n(i) The total value of the work\nproperly executed by the\nContractor (clause 4.2.1 (a)), and\n(ii) Materials on site (clause 4.2.1 (b)),\nand possibly\n(iii) Materials off site (clause 42.1 (c)),\nThe value of any off-site goods and\nmaterials may be included at the\ndiscretion of the Architect\/CA.

A\nfurther advantage in the delivery of the material was that the resultant set of files required only\nWindows 3.1 to be available, thus enabling study to be conducted on any departmental\ncomputer, networked or otherwise. Sixty students undertook the computer-based study and 3&\n(63%) voluntarily completed a feedback questionnaire on the following points of interest.\nLocation and timing of study\nThe departmental computer laboratory was booked for the timetable periods corresponding to\nthe cancelled lectures. The computer-based material was made available to the students to copy\nto their own disks such that they could choose when and where to carry out the study, whether\nduring the booked laboratory periods or at another time elsewhere. A major advantage to the\nstudents was that the resultant files were quite small in terms of the disk space required (80\nKbytes) and in only requiring Windows 3.1 to be available, they could be used on a wide\nvariety of machines both inside and outside the university.\nThe students were asked whether they used the computer tutorial at the university in the\nbooked laboratory period, at the university at another time, or at home\/elsewhere. Eight\nstudents chose more than one place of use and the responses are shown in Table 1.\n100\nVolume 4 Number I\nPlace of Use\nUniversity in booked time\nUniversity at other times\nHome \/Elsewhere\nNumber of students\n17\n11\n18\nTable I: Location and\ntiming of study of the\ncomputer tutorial\nA significant number of students took advantage of the opportunity to study either 'out of\nhours' and\/or outside the university. It was apparent that the more computer-literate students\nwho liked to work from home were very enthusiastic about the exercise. However, a\nsignificant number of the student group took advantage of the booked laboratory time, and they\ncommented that the success of such an exercise depended on their gaining access to a\nuniversity computer and that, in their experience, casual access was often not available. The\nimplications of a more widespread use of this method of delivery on the demand for university\ncomputers would need careful consideration.\nEase of use of the computer-based material\nThe responses to a question regarding the ease of use of the tutorial are shown in Table 2. The\nmajority of students experienced little or no difficulty in using the tutorial which was\ngratifying for the author of this paper in his first attempt at using the authorware. Of those few\nwho experienced difficulty, it was clear that a small number of students were 'anti-computers'\nregardless of this exercise. Gilleard (1995), in the field of building services engineering, found\na similarly positive response to CAL tutorial work, especially where CAL design and\npresentation promoted ease of understanding.\nEase of Use\nVery easy\nEasy\nDifficult\nVery difficult\nNumber of students\n12\n22\n4\n0\nTable 2: Ease of use of the\ncomputer tutorial\nI noted several distractions during the laboratory periods with regard to noise from other users\n(vacant machines were available for other students), demands of other work (including the\ntemptation to use the computer time to word-process outstanding assignments) and technical\nproblems (usually with regard to the students' own disks). All these factors were disruptive,\nand mitigated against effective study. Some form of controlled environment, as on 'silence'\nfloors in a library, may be necessary if this form of delivery were to become more prevalent.\nLecture vs. computer-based study\nThe students were asked whether they preferred study of this subject by traditional lecture,\ncomputer tutorial or a mixture of the two. Their responses are shown in Table 3.\n101\nDerek Lavelle Replacement of traditional lectures with computer-based tutorials: a case study\nPreference of studs-\nLecture only\nComputer tutorial only\nMixture of lecture \/CBT\nNo preference\nNumber of students\n7\n4\n24\n3\nTable 3: Preference for\nform of study\nThe responses to this question are particularly interesting. Despite a very positive overall\nreaction to the use of the computer to assist their study, a notable majority of the student group\nstill favoured retention of the traditional lecture in some form. A mixture of the two types of\nstudy was the strongly preferred option. This overall response is matched by the experiences of\nothers. Cordell (1991), studying learning styles and CAL in the field of health care,\nrecommends that educators should continue to use a variety of instructional methods including\nCAL to facilitate learning. Edward (1995) concludes that an effective computer-based\nlaboratory simulation will enhance but not replace traditional techniques. The experiences of\nHoward et al (1995) in the field of construction technology, suggest that while being positive\nabout the adoption of new teaching technologies, students still value human interaction with\nlecturers and that an effective integration of technology into existing teaching and learning\nstrategies is required.\nHowever, alternative opinions have also been offered. Garrud et al (1993) in the field of\nmedicine, conclude, with reservations, that CAL can effectively substitute for traditional\ndidactic teaching. Stokes (1994) describes a project whereby lectures and seminars were\nreplaced with CAL material. The use of commercial CAL material proved problematic, but the\nsubsequent development of in-house CAL material is proving to be a success.\nThe issue of replacing versus enhancing traditional teaching with computer-based instruction is\na delicate one. It is evident that truly effective CAL does not bolt on to existing lectures and\nseminars, but rather causes the focus of them to alter. Contact time may be more suitably used\nto offer support and feedback rather than the traditional emphasis on provision of information.\nThere is considerable value in a human expert setting the scene, establishing expectations and\nbeing available for consultation as a course of study progresses. Experience to date would\nsuggest that, once good quality CAL is available, a judicious balance of teaching modes is\nrequired to allow for effective integration of CAL into a curriculum.\nFlexibility of study\nThe computer tutorial was designed to offer flexibility in timing and pace of study. The\nresponses of the students as to whether this was a good or bad idea are shown in Table 4.\nThe computer tutorial was designed to offer the opportunity to review material as required. The\nresponses of the students as to whether or not the material worked in this respect are shown in\nTable 5.\nNot unexpectedly, there was a very positive response to the opportunity to break free from the\nconstraints of fixed timing and pace of delivery associated with traditional lectures. The\nresponses may seem to be obvious, but this was a novice group with regard to CAL, so their\n102\nALT-] Volume 4 Number I\nTable 4: Ability to control\nthe timing and pace of\nstudy\nFlexibility of timing and pace of\nstudy considered to be a:\nGoodidea\nBad idea\nNot concerned\nNumber of students\n29\n5\n4\nAbility to review the material\nconsidered to be:\nBeneficial\nNot beneficial\nNot concerned\nNumber of students\n30\n3\n5\nTable 5: Ability to review\nthe computer-based\nmaterial\ninitial reactions are particularly noteworthy. It was noticeable that some students, having been\ndirected into the material, took the opportunity to engage in more intensive study than would\nnormally be expected in following up a traditional lecture. Striking a more negative tone, some\nstudents did not enter into such 'deep' learning and felt the need for the clear and strict\ndirection obtainable in a lecture, despite supplementary notes being available to them. Isaacs\n(1990) concludes that tutorial CAL has a definite role in assisting students to learn freely, that\nis to learn what they will and when they will. However, he also highlights the range of study\nskills which students require before gaining maximum benefit from tutorial CAL.\nFurther computer-based study\nStudents were asked if they would like to see more of this type of study on their course. Their\nresponses are shown in Table 6.\nTable 6: Preference for\nfurther computer-based\nstudy\nWould you like further study of\nthis type on your course ?\nYes\nNo\nNot concerned\nNumber of students\n20\n6\n12\nIn considering this exercise as a pilot study, the overall positive response acts as a suitable\nencouragement for further development of the computer-based material. A sizeable number of\nstudents replied that they did not mind whether there was more computer-based study or not,\nimplying that they are indifferent to the medium adopted and are content to leave such choices\nto the academics concerned.\n103\nDerek Love\/fe Replacement of traditional lectures with computer-based tutorials: a case study\nUse of staff time\nIt is difficult to be totally unequivocal about the efficiency of staff time when engaged in such\nwork. There is obviously a front-end investment of time required in converting and updating\nmaterials to be suitable for use in electronic mode. However, if carried out wisely, this should\nresult in many hours of student learning time being provided, hopefully with only minimum\neffort required in future updating of the material, this clearly being dependent on the subject\nunder consideration.\nGarrud et al (1993) were very clear that good quality CAL requires substantial resources and\nhigh-calibre staff to develop and maintain it. Stokes (1994) reported a lower than average\nrequirement of development hours for in-house production of CAL, indicating that efficiency\ngains can result from good management and adequate resourcing. The courseware supporting\nthe project described in this paper was developed totally in-house with the help of suitable\nauthorware. Built Environment does not have access as yet to much subject-specific material in\nthe public domain, and we are now actively considering a strategy for in-house CAL\ndevelopment.\nLearning outcomes\nAll of the results reported above are with regard to the behavioural response of the students to\nthe change in media. The effect on academic performance is usually considered as the main\ncriterion for evaluation in this type of study. However, it has not been possible in this pilot\nstudy to measure discrete effects on performance. The assessment of the subject was integrated\nin such a way that it was difficult to identify the results in the topics delivered by computer\nseparately from those delivered traditionally. The study did not extend to altering the basis of\nassesment at this stage. In further development of this material, it may be possible to use self-\nassessment to provide more definite feedback on learning outcomes as well as to improve the\nlearning process.\nAcademic performance may not be totally independent of behavioural response. My own\nearlier work (Lavelle, 1992) demonstrated how a systematic use of appropriate IT facilities\nhelped to promote the development of cognitive skills and the adoption of new techniques. It is\npossible that the generally positive response of the students to their use of the computer-based\nmaterial may demonstrate sufficient motivation towards a higher level of performance.\nHowever, the range of marks in the subject revealed nothing unusual when compared with\nother subjects, nor with previous student cohorts. On this basis, one could infer that there was\nno significant effect on performance either way, but the evidence is not conclusive because of\nthe number of interdependent variables affecting performance at this level.\nConclusion\nWith reference to the aims of this pilot study, the conversion of existing lecture material into\ncomputer-based material on an in-house production basis is proving viable, and shows promise\nfor further development. The positive feedback from the student cohort on their use of the pilot\nCAL material also gives encouragement for further development.\n104\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nReferences\nClarke, A.
