The model is driven by observed meteorology from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), constrained by satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and run for the years 1983\u20131993. Modeled mean annual C3 discrimination during this period is 19.2\u2030; total mean annual discrimination by the terrestrial biosphere (C3 and C4 plants) is 15.9\u2030. We test simulation results in three ways. First, we compare the modeled response of C3 discrimination to changes in physiological stress, including daily variations in vapor pressure deficit (vpd) and monthly variations in precipitation, to observed changes in discrimination inferred from Keeling plot intercepts. Second, we compare mean \u03b413C ratios from selected biomes (Broadleaf, Temperate Broadleaf, Temperate Conifer, and Boreal) to the observed values from Keeling plots at these biomes. Third, we compare simulated zonal \u03b413C ratios in the Northern Hemisphere (20\u00b0N to 60\u00b0N) to values predicted from high-frequency variations in measured atmospheric CO2 and \u03b413C from terrestrially dominated sites within the NOAA-Globalview flask network. The modeled response to changes in vapor pressure deficit compares favorably to observations. Simulated discrimination in tropical forests of the Amazon basin is less sensitive to changes in monthly precipitation than is suggested by some observations. Mean model \u03b413C ratios for Broadleaf, Temperate Broadleaf, Temperate Conifer, and Boreal biomes compare well with the few measurements available; however, there is more variability in observations than in the simulation, and modeled \u03b413C values for tropical forests are heavy relative to observations. Simulated zonal \u03b413C ratios in the Northern Hemisphere capture patterns of zonal \u03b413C inferred from atmospheric measurements better than previous investigations.

Simulated zonal \u03b413C ratios in the Northern Hemisphere capture patterns of zonal \u03b413C inferred from atmospheric measurements better than previous investigations.

Introduction\n[2] Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have been increas-\ning for the past 150 years due to combustion of fossil fuels,\nmanufacture of cement, and biomass burning. In the 1980s,\nthis anthropogenic CO2 was added to the atmosphere at a\nrate of approximately 5.4 \u00b1 0.3 Pg-C\/year; in the 1990s the\nrate was 6.3 \u00b1 0.4 Pg-C\/year [Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC), 2001]. However, over these\nsame periods, atmospheric CO2 only increased at rates of\n3.3 \u00b1 0.1 and 3.2 \u00b1 0.1 Pg-C\/year, respectively. Conse-\nquently, during this time, there were natural sinks for nearly\nhalf of the anthropogenically added CO2. However, in spite\nof this knowledge of bulk changes in atmospheric CO2, the\nspatial and temporal distribution of the sinks, partitioning\nof the fluxes into land and ocean components, and the\nprocesses involved are still uncertain.\nGLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES, VOL. 19, GB1017, doi:10.1029\/2003GB002141, 2005\n1Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort\nCollins, Colorado, USA.\n2Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution of Washington,\nStanford University, Stanford, California, USA.\n3Geography Department, University of California, Santa Barbara,\nCalifornia, USA.\n4Department of Geography, University of Leicester, Leicester, England,\nUK.\n5National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\/CMDL, Boulder,\nColorado, USA.\n6Also at Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research, University of\nColorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0886-6236\/05\/2003GB002141$12.00\nGB1017 1 of 15\n[3] Carbon isotopes can be helpful in investigations of the\nsink because they give information about both sources and\nprocesses of CO2 exchange. At the local level, carbon\nisotopes are helpful in understanding (1) plant water use\nefficiency and the response of plants to changes in precip-\nitation and relative humidity [Farquhar and Richards, 1984;\nFarquhar et al., 1988; Condon et al., 1993; Hall et al.,\n1993; Schulze et al., 1996, 1998; Ekblad and Ho\u00a8gberg,\n2001; Bowling et al., 2002; Ometto et al., 2002], (2)\nvariation in light distribution and stand structure [Berry et\nal., 1997; Buchmann et al., 1997a, 1997b; Le Roux et al.,\n2001], (3) recycling of respired CO2 [Keeling, 1961;\nSchleser and Jayasekera, 1985; Sternberg, 1989; Lloyd et\nal., 1996; Sternberg et al., 1997], and (4) determining the\nrelative contributions of photosynthesis and respiration to\ntotal net ecosystem exchange [Yakir and Wang, 1996;\nBowling et al., 2001]. At the global scale, carbon isotopes\nhave been used to (1) determine spatial and temporal\ndistribution of sources and sinks and, in some cases,\ndetermine partitioning of oceanic and terrestrial fluxes\n[Francey, 1985; Keeling et al., 1989, 1995; Francey et\nal., 1995; Tans et al., 1993; Ciais et al., 1995a, 1995b;\nEnting et al., 1995; Fung et al., 1997; Rayner et al., 1999;\nBousquet et al., 1999a, 1999b] and (2) to examine relative\ncontributions of C3 and C4 plants to total primary produc-\ntivity [Lloyd and Farquhar, 1994; Ehleringer et al., 1997;\nSage et al., 1999]. Many of these studies show that plant\ndiscrimination can change rapidly and that it is very\nsensitive to environmental changes; however, most of the\nglobal models must make simplifying assumptions\nconcerning carbon isotope discrimination of the terrestrial\nbiosphere, and few models function on multiple spatial and\ntemporal scales, so that the results can be directly compared\nto observations at both flux towers and flask stations.\n[4] Previous studies that modeled carbon isotope discrim-\nination of the terrestrial biosphere used monthly mean\nvalues of temperature, precipitation, and humidity, were\ndriven by meteorology produced in a GCM, or were\nproduced using modeled vegetation [Lloyd and Farquhar,\n1994; Fung et al., 1997; Kaplan et al., 2002], and none\noperate within the framework of GCM which is simulta-\nneously calculating turbulent exchange of heat, water, and\ncarbon fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere. We\nwanted to construct a model that was capable of being\ndriven by observed meteorology and vegetation so that\nresults could be compared to historical records. We also\nwanted a model that could function online with a GCM so\nthat we could examine systematic relationships between\nFigure 1. Flow of data in the simulation. ECMWF provides 6-hourly (1) wind speed at 10 m height, (2)\ntemperature at 2 m, (3) relative humidity at 2 m, (4) total incident solar radiation, and (5) precipitation.\nMonthly vegetation maps (linearly interpolated each day) are from processed satellite data. C3\/C4 plant\ndistributions are from ecosystem modeling, satellite data, and maps of agriculture [Still et al., 2003]. SiB2\ncalculates (1) rates of assimilation, (2) leaf boundary layer, stomatal and mesophyll conductance, and (3)\nCO2 concentrations in the plant (Cs, Ci, Cc) and canopy (Ca). C3\/C4 distributions are from ecosystem\nmodeling, satellite data, and maps of agriculture [Still et al., 2003] (see Figure 2 in this paper). CRAX\ncalculates carbon isotope discrimination of C3 and C4 plants. The dashed arrow indicates that CFRAX\ncan be coupled interactively with SiB2 to provide d13C of respiration and canopy CO2 during each time\nstep. That feature is not used in this study.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n2 of 15\nGB1017\nbiology and atmospheric dynamics and so that it could be\nused as a predictive tool. Finally, we wanted a model that\nwould function on local to global spatial scales and hourly\nto interannual timescales so that spatial and temporal scales\nof the simulations would be comparable to the spatial and\ntemporal scales represented by data collected at both flux\ntowers and flask stations.\n[5] The intent of this paper is to (1) present the mechanics\nof a model and simulation of terrestrial carbon isotope\ndiscrimination, (2) present the results of a global simulation\nat 1\u0001 resolution that is driven by observed meteorology and\nsatellite-derived vegetation characteristics, and (3) evaluate\nsimulation results by comparing them to observations taken\nat different temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, we\ncompare (1) the simulated relationship between d13C of\nassimilated carbon and mean daily vapor pressure deficit\n(vpd) to field data from Bowling et al. [2002]; (2) the\nsimulated relationship between d13C of assimilated carbon\nand monthly precipitation to field data from Ometto et al.\n[2002]; (3) mean d13C ratios for four biomes (Broadleaf,\nTemperate Broadleaf, Temperate Conifer, and Boreal) to\nobserved d13C of ecosystem respiration from those biomes\n[Pataki et al., 2003]; and (4) zonal mean assimilation-\nweighted d13C ratios of terrestrial biomass for 20\u0001N to\n60\u0001N to d13C ratios of CO2 fluxes inferred for terrestrially\ndominated stations of the NOAA Globalview Flask Net-\nwork in the same latitude band [Miller et al., 2003].\n2. Method\n[6] SiB2 is a model of the terrestrial biosphere that\ncalculates surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat, radia-\ntion, moisture, CO2, and momentum for vegetated land\npoints [Sellers et al., 1986, 1996a; Denning et al., 1996a;\nSchaefer et al., 2002]. SiB2 functions at local, regional, and\nglobal spatial scales, and can be driven by observed\nmeteorology or coupled to a global climate model. In the\npresent simulation, SiB2 is driven by assimilated meteorol-\nogy for 1983\u20131993 provided by the European Centre for\nMedium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) with a 1\u0001\nspatial resolution and a 6-hour time step (Figure 1) (see\nSchaefer et al. [2002] for more results from this particular\nsimulation). ECMWF provides (1) wind speed at 10 m\nheight, (2) temperature at 2 m, (3) relative humidity at 2 m,\n(4) total incident solar radiation, and (5) precipitation\n[Gibson et al., 1999]. Time-varying phenological properties\nsuch as leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of photosynthet-\nically active radiation absorbed by the green canopy\nFigure 2. Distribution of C3 and C4 plants [Still et al., 2003] is determined using remote sensing\nproducts [Defries and Townshend, 1994; DeFries et al., 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2000], physiological\nmodeling [Collatz et al., 1998], crop fraction maps [Ramankutty and Foley, 1998], and areal coverage\ndata on crop types [FAO, 1998]. See color version of this figure at back of this issue.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n3 of 15\nGB1017\n(FPAR), and canopy greenness fraction are linearly inter-\npolated each day from monthly maps of processed normal-\nized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from\nAVHRR red and near-infrared reflectance [Los, 1998; Los et\nal., 2000]. Vegetation type is from Defries and Townshend\n[1994]. Other constant parameters, including canopy height\nand soil properties, are from look-up tables [Zobler, 1986;\nSellers et al., 1996b]. The distribution of C3 and C4 plants\n(Figure 2) [Still et al., 2003] is determined using remote\nsensing products [Defries and Townshend, 1994; DeFries et\nal., 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2000], physiological modeling\n[Collatz et al., 1998], crop fraction maps [Ramankutty and\nFoley, 1998], and areal coverage data on crop types [Food\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1998]. Spatial resolu-\ntion in the simulation is 1\u0001 \u0001 1\u0001. Recent improvements to\nSiB2 include the introduction of a six-layer soil temperature\nsubmodel based on the work of Bonan [1996, 1998] and a\nrevised surface energy budget that includes prognostic\ntemperature and moisture of the canopy air space reservoir\n[Baker et al., 2003]. The calculations are implicit and allow\nfor canopy storage, i.e., memory. Model results have been\nevaluated at local scales [Baker et al., 2003], regional scales\n[Denning et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2004] and global\nscales [Denning et al., 1996b].\n[7] Another major change to SiB2 is the introduction of a\nscheme for calculating carbon isotope ratios of terrestrial\nCO2 fluxes. Discrimination against\n13C during C3 photo-\nsynthesis is the result of a multistage process (Figure 3)\ninvolving relatively small isotope effects during transport of\nCO2 from the canopy to the chloroplast and a large isotope\neffect associated with fixation by ribulose bisphosphate\ncarboxylase\/oxygenase (rubisco). Similar to equation (A6)\nin the Appendix of Farquhar and Richards [1984], we\nmodel this with three transport steps: (1) molecular diffu-\nsion across a laminar boundary layer at the leaf surface, (2)\nmolecular diffusion through a stomatal pore into the stoma-\ntal cavity, and (3) dissolution into mesophyll water and\naqueous transport to the chloroplast. This is followed by\nfixation with rubisco or other enzymes. Unlike Farquhar\nand Richards [1984], we do not include isotope effects\nassociated with either dark respiration or photorespiration.\nThis is because these effects are poorly characterized and\nprobably quite small [Farquhar et al., 1989; O\u2019Leary, 1993;\nBrugnoli and Farquhar, 2000]. During photosynthesis, a\nCO2 concentration gradient from the atmosphere to the\nchloroplast produces a flux into the plant. At each step,\nthere is a slightly different CO2 concentration which we\ndesignate as follows: Ca is CO2 in the canopy air, Cs is CO2\nin the leaf boundary layer, Ci is CO2 in the stomatal cavity,\nand Cc is CO2 at the chloroplast. A resistance modulates\ntransport from one step to the next: rb for transport from the\ncanopy air into the leaf boundary layer, rs for transport\nthrough the stomatal pore, and rc for transport to the\nchloroplast. These steps are also associated with isotope\neffects discriminating against 13C: Db, Ds, Ddiss, and Daq,\nrespectively. Finally, there is an isotope effect during\nenzymatic fixation with rubisco, Df. The D values that we\nuse are Db = 2.9%, Ds = 4.4%, Ddiss = 1.1%, Daq = 0.7%,\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of carbon flow through C3 plants in CFRAX. Ca, Cs, Ci, and Cc are\nCO2 partial pressures in the canopy, at the leaf surface, and in the stomatal cavity and chloroplast,\nrespectively; rb, rs, and rm are resistances to molecular diffusion of CO2 across the leaf boundary layer,\nthrough the stomatal pore and from the stomatal cavity to the chloroplast, respectively; and Db, Ds, Ddiss,\nDaq, and Df are kinetic isotope effects accompanying molecular diffusion of CO2 across the leaf boundary\nlayer, through the stomatal pore, and from the stomatal cavity to the chloroplast (dissolution plus aqueous\ntransport) and enzymatic fixation, respectively [Craig, 1953; Mook et al., 1974; Farquhar, 1983;\nO\u2019Leary, 1984].\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n4 of 15\nGB1017\nand Df = 28.2%, where D is defined as follows.

Units for d and D are per mil (%).\nD = (dA \u0005 dB)\/(dB\/1000 + 1) \t (dA \u0005 dB). Ds and Db are from\ntheoretical calculations of molecular diffusion of CO2\nthrough air and across a laminar boundary layer [Craig,\n1953; Farquhar, 1983]. Ddiss and Daq are from laboratory\nmeasurements [Mook et al., 1974; O\u2019Leary, 1984]. At the\nchloroplast, CO2 can react with rubisco or other enzymes.\nThe fraction reacting with other enzymes is not well known.\nRaven and Farquhar [1990] have suggested that the upper\nlimit is about 10%. In our simulation, Df is calculated by\nassuming that 92.5% of the assimilated CO2 reacts with\nrubisco with an isotope effect of 30.0% [Brugnoli and\nFarquhar, 2000], while the remaining reacts with phos-\nphoenyl pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), with an isotope\neffect of 5.7% [Farquhar, 1983], giving a net isotope effect\n(Df) of 28.2%.

Net assimilation (An, where An is\ngross photosynthesis minus aboveground autotrophic respi-\nration) is calculated using a combination of Farquhar\nkinetics [Farquhar et al., 1980] as modified by Collatz et\nal. [1991, 1992], and the Ball-Berry equation (4) for\nstomatal conductance (gs, where gs = 1\/rs) [Ball, 1988]\n[see Sellers et al., 1996c, Appendix C].\ngs \u00bc m Anhs\u00f0 \u00de\nCs\n\u0001 p\u00fe b; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere hs is relative humidity at the leaf surface and is\nrelated to relative humidity of the canopy air through rb and\nthe transpiration rate, which is a function of wind speed and\nleaf geometry.

RSTFAC is a soil water\nstress factor [Sellers et al., 1996a] (see also Evans and\nLoretto [2000] and references therein for a discussion of the\neffects of soil water stress on mesophyll conductance). Four\nthousand is a constant used to adjust mesophyll conduc-\ntance to achieve a drop in CO2 pressure between Ci and Cc\nof about 8 Pa at high rates of photosynthesis [Evans and\nLoretto, 2000].\n[9] C4 photosynthesis also discriminates against 13C, but\nto a much lesser extent. In C4 plants, CO2 is \u2018\u2018captured\u2019\u2019\nin the stomatal cavity and transported to the site of\nenzymatic fixation with PEPC. Since nearly all of the\nCO2 that reaches the site of fixation in C4 plants is\nassimilated, the kinetic isotope effects that are expressed\nare largely those involved in transport. Consequently, in\nthis model we assume that carbon isotopic discrimination\nin C4 plants is constant and equal to the isotope effect\nassociated with diffusion through the stomatal pore, i.e.,\nDPSC4 = 4.4%.\n[10] There have been several previous studies modeling\nglobal terrestrial discrimination [Lloyd and Farquhar,\n1994; Fung et al., 1997; Kaplan et al., 2002]. These\nstudies differ from ours in the following ways (Table 1).\nLloyd and Farquhar calculate monthly net assimilation as\na simple function of climatologic monthly mean 0.5\u0001 \u0001\n0.5\u0001 temperature and precipitation [Friedlingstein et al.,\n1992; Leemans and Cramer, 1991] and monthly 2.5\u0001 \u0001\n2.5\u0001 wet and dry bulb temperatures from ECMWF. Land-\ncover is from Wilson and Henderson-Sellers [1985].\nStomatal CO2 concentrations are calculated using an\nanalytic model of optimal stomatal behavior with respect\nto water use efficiency. Chloroplast CO2 concentrations\nare based on observed relationships between canopy CO2,\nstomatal CO2, and chloroplast CO2. C3 discrimination is\ncalculated using an equation similar to (3), although they\ninclude effects of autotrophic respiration and photorespi-\nration and neglect the effect of transport across the leaf\nboundary layer. The effect of both of these differences on\nnet discrimination is small. C3\/C4 distributions in the\nwork of Lloyd and Farquhar are based on a combination\nof physiological modeling and landcover maps from\nWilson and Henderson-Sellers [1985]. C4 plants account\nfor 21% of global GPP. C4 discrimination is a function of\ninternal CO2 concentrations and the leakiness of the\nbundle sheath cells. Net global C4 discrimination in the\nwork of Lloyd and Farquhar is 3.6%. Total discrimination\n(C3 and C4) in the work of Lloyd and Farquhar is 14.8%;\nC3 discrimination is 17.8%.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n5 of

[1997] calculate net assimilation at a\n4\u0001 \u0001 5\u0001 resolution using monthly mean output from an\nolder version of SiB2 coupled to a global climate model\n[Sellers et al., 1996a, 1996b; Randall et al., 1996]. Fung\net al. calculate net assimilation-weighted Ci\/Ca ratios by\nsimultaneously solving for Ci, stomatal conductance, and\nnet assimilation. Discrimination is based on a two-step\nmodel of photosynthesis that includes only transport of\nCO2 into the leaf, followed by enzymatic fixation. Fung et\nal. assume that savannas are 75% C4 and land areas\ncovered by shrubs and groundcover are 50% C4. C4\nplants make up 27% of GPP. C4 discrimination is fixed\nat 4.4%. Total discrimination in the work of Fung et al. is\n15.7%; C3 discrimination is 20.0%.\n[12] Kaplan et al. [2002] calculate net assimilation using\na model of the terrestrial biosphere (BIOME4) driven by\n0.5\u0001 \u0001 0.5\u0001 gridded climatology (Climate 2.2), which is an\nupdated version of work by Leemans and Cramer [1991].\nVegetation, including C3\/C4 distributions, is determined in\na dynamic vegetation model with an agricultural mask.\nKaplan et al. calculate water-limited Ci\/Ca ratios in a\nprocess-based model of canopy conductance. The discrim-\nination model is similar to that of Lloyd and Farquhar. C4\nplant distributions in BIOME4 are determined in a dynamic\nvegetation model with an agricultural mask. C4 plants\nconstitute only about 15% of global GPP, significantly less\nthan suggested by the models here (J. O. Kaplan, personal\ncommunication, 2004), which range from 21% to 27% or\nthe 18% estimated by Ehleringer et al. [1997]. C4 discrim-\nination in the work of Kaplan et al. is determined in a\nmanner similar to that of Lloyd and Farquhar. Discrimina-\ntion for C4 plants is not given. Total discrimination in the\nwork of Kaplan et al. is 18.6% or 18.1% with the\nagricultural mask; C3 discrimination is 20.0 \u00b1 1.0%.\nThe higher total discrimination in the work of Kaplan et\nal. relative to the other models, as well as observations\n[Bakwin et al., 1998; Miller et al., 2003], is probably due\nlargely to differences in global C3\/C4 distributions.\n[13] Our simulation calculates net assimilation each 10-\nmin time step using an updated version of SiB2 coupled to\nassimilated 6-hourly 1\u0001 \u0001 1\u0001 weather from ECMWF for\n1983 through 1993. We calculate internal CO2 concentra-\ntions each time step in SiB2 as described earlier. One\ndifference between our simulation and that of Fung et al.\n[1997] is that we calculate net assimilation solving for Cc\ninstead of Ci. Discrimination is determined using equation\n(3). As Fung et al. point out, all other things being equal,\nneglecting isotope effects during transport of CO2 from the\nstomatal cavity to the chloroplast can reduce total C3\ndiscrimination by about 2\u20133%. However, since we calcu-\nlate net assimilation using Cc instead of Ci, net assimilation\nrates are lower and consequently the change in discrimina-\ntion is much less than 2\u20133%. We use C4 maps based on\nphysiological modeling, satellite observations, and agricul-\ntural maps [Still et al., 2003]. C4 plants constitute 25% of\nGPP. C4 discrimination is fixed at 4.4%. Total discrimina-\ntion in our study is 15.9%; C3 discrimination is 19.2%. A\nfinal feature of our discrimination module is that it can be\ncoupled to a prognostic canopy air space and can thus be\nused to examine systematic variations between discrimina-\ntion and transport on the time step of the simulation\nincluding recycling of respired CO2 and Rayleigh-type\ndistillation of canopy CO2 during daytime photosynthesis.\n[14] The d13C values reported here are weighted by\nassimilation. 12C and 13C fluxes are calculated separately\nfor C3 and C4 plants and then summed to get grid values for\neach time step. At the end of the year, we divide by total net\nassimilation to retrieve the d13C of plant carbon assimilated\nwithin that grid cell during the preceding year. At the end of\nthe 11-year run, we calculate mean and standard deviation\nof annual assimilation weighted d13C ratios for each 1\u0001 \u0001 1\u0001\ngrid cell. Since we want to focus here on the response of the\nterrestrial discrimination to climate variations, we hold the\nconcentration and carbon isotope ratio of canopy CO2\nconstant. This necessarily neglects the influence of varia-\ntions in d13C of canopy CO2 on d\n13C of assimilated carbon\ndue to (1) recycling of respired CO2, (2) enrichment of\ncanopy CO2 in\n13C due to preferential of removal of 12C\nduring photosynthesis, (3) turbulent mixing with the atmo-\nspheric boundary layer, and (4) seasonal variations in d13C\nof atmospheric CO2. A subsequent analysis will evaluate the\ninfluence of a dynamic canopy on d13C of terrestrial fluxes.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Spatial Variations in D13C of Plant Carbon\n[15] Spatial variations in d13C of plant carbon are\ncomplex and reflect climate, water availability, biome\ntype and C3\/C4 distributions (Figure 4a). In general,\nthe lightest d13C values for are found at high northern\nlatitudes and reflect both the absence of C4 plants and\nincreased discrimination in C3 plants due to zonal varia-\ntions in the modeled Cc\/Ca ratio. The starkest contrasts\nglobally are those produced by variations in C3\/C4\ndistributions. There is a zonal trend to this distribution\nand its influence on d13C; that is, the heaviest d13C values\nare found approximately 10\u0001 to 20\u0001 north and south of\nthe equator, mirroring the distribution of C4 grasslands.\nFigure 4. (a) Mean annual assimilation-weighted d13C of terrestrial plant carbon from an 11-year simulation (1983\u20131993)\nand (b) standard deviation in annual d13C values. During each time step, net assimilation is multiplied by the d13C of\nassimilated plant carbon. At the end of the year, the sum of net assimilation times d13C is divided by total annual net\nassimilation to give the d13C value of carbon assimilated in each grid cell during that calendar year. The mean is the average\nof the 11 annual values. The standard deviation is also for those 11 values. Please note the higher resolution used in\nreporting more negative mean values (Figure 4a). This is done in order to highlight spatial variations in C3 discrimination.\nThere is tremendous spatial variability in d13C values of terrestrial carbon. The sharpest spatial contrasts are the result of\ndifferences in C3\/C4 ratios. Variation in d13C values of C3 plants is largely driven by differences in relative humidity during\nthe growing season. Larger than average standard deviations are found in areas where ECMWF predicts significant\nvariations in annual precipitation. See color version of this figure at back of this issue.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n8 of 15\nGB1017\nHowever, there are also important longitudinal patterns in\nd13C values that are produced not only by C3\/C4 distribu-\ntions, but also by variations in climate and biome type.\nExamples of this include the influence of high C4 ratios in\nthe North American Plains and African Sahel on d13C of\nterrestrial biomass of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres.\nTable 2 presents d13C ratios of all plants (d13CTot) and C3\nplants only (d13CC3) broken down by biome.\n[16] The standard deviations in annual d13C values for\nindividual grid cells for the 11 years are generally less\nthan 0.3% (Figure 4b). The largest standard deviations\nare generally found in areas where ECMWF predicts\nlarge variations in annual precipitation and occasional\ndrought. The most prominent example is the western\nand southern edges of the Amazon basin, which in\nECMWF reanalysis experienced significantly drier con-\nditions in 1983\u20131986, relative to the rest of the 11-year\nsimulation.\n3.2. Evaluation of Model Results\n3.2.1. C3 Discrimination and Vapor Pressure Deficit\n[17] Laboratory and field studies show that discrimination\nin C3 plants is largely controlled by the influence of vapor\npressure deficit (vpd) on stomatal conductance and Cc\/Ca\nratios [Farquhar and Richards, 1984; Farquhar et al., 1982,\n1989; Berry, 1988; Condon et al., 1993; Hall et al., 1993].\nSince vpd of canopy air changes over the course of the day\nand from one day to the next, carbon isotope discrimination\nshould change just as quickly. Until recently, however, it has\nbeen difficult to quantify changes in discrimination in\nnatural ecosystems on these short timescales.\n[18] Nighttime Keeling plot intercepts record d13C of\nrespired CO2 fluxes (d\n13CR) from aboveground (bole, stem,\nleaf, and heterotrophic) and belowground (root and decom-\nposing soil organic matter) sources [Keeling, 1958].\nHo\u00a8gberg et al. [2001] have shown that tree girdling reduced\nsoil respiration by up to 37% after only 5 days, indicating\nthat roots are responsible for approximately 40% of the total\nsoil CO2 flux. Using the fact that d\n13C of root respiration\nreflects the carbon isotope ratio of recent photosynthate\n[Andrews et al., 1999; Lin et al., 1999], Ekblad and Ho\u00a8gberg\n[2001] and Bowling et al. [2002] then demonstrated that\nvariations in d13C of ecosystem respiration are strongly\ncorrelated with changes in relative humidity and\/or vapor\npressure deficit that have occurred within the previous 2 to\n10 days. Consequently, changes in nighttime Keeling plot\nintercepts reflect humidity-induced changes in discrimina-\ntion through the release of recently fixed carbon during\nautotrophic respiration.\n[19] In order to evaluate the ability of our model to\naccurately represent the relationship between C3 discrim-\nination and relative humidity, we compare simulated\nmean daily vapor pressure deficits and assimilation-\nweighted d13C values for C3 plants to the observed\nrelationships (Figure 5). We have chosen sites similar to\nthose presented by Ekblad and Ho\u00a8gberg [2001] and\nBowling et al. [2002], as well as others spanning a range\nof vapor pressure deficits and biomes. In general, the\nmodel successfully captures the relationship between vpd\nand d13C and is bracketed by the observations. However,\nthere are differences between model results and observa-\ntion that are worth noting. The d13C values in the\nsimulation are similar to those observed by Ekblad and\nHo\u00a8gberg, but slightly less negative than those of Bowling\net al. There are a couple of reasons that it is difficult to\nassess the importance of these absolute differences in\nd13C values. First, both sets of observations include\nundetermined offsets due to the fact that the d13C of\ndecomposing soil organic matter (SOM) is unknown. In\ngeneral, CO2 from decomposing SOM is thought to be\nenriched in 13C relative to recently fixed photosynthate as\na consequence of a terrestrial \u2018\u2018Suess Effect\u2019\u2019 [e.g., Ciais\net al., 1999]. On the basis of flux-weighted ages of\ndecomposing SOM [Fung et al., 1997] and a long-term\nrecord of d13C of atmospheric CO2 [Francey et al.,\n1999], we might expect d13C of SOM in northern Sweden\nto be enriched relative to recent photosynthate by about\n0.7%, whereas the sites of Bowling et al. would be\nslightly less enriched and more variable (0.2% to 0.7%).\nHowever, these are only rough estimates, and more would\nhave to be known about the age and turnover rate of the\nSOM at specific sites to be more precise. If decomposing\nsoil organic matter produced 60% of the soil CO2 flux, a\n0.7% offset would mean that d13C of recently fixed\ncarbon was approximately 0.4% more negative than\nobservations indicate. Another problem with comparing\nthe two studies is that they use slightly different meth-\nodologies. The differences include: (1) different methods\nwere used for collecting and analyzing gas samples, (2)\nEkblad and Ho\u00a8gberg looked at a single site, whereas\nBowling et al. used four sites, (3) Ekblad and Ho\u00a8gberg\nused a 2- to 3-day lag time, whereas Bowling et al. used\nlag times ranging from 5 to 10 days, and (4) Ekblad and\nHo\u00a8gberg took climate data from a weather station at the\nsite, whereas Bowling et al. had to infer climatic con-\nditions from stations located farther afield.

C3 Discrimination and Monthly Precipitation\n[20] Ometto et al. [2002] examine the relationship\nbetween C3 discrimination and monthly precipitation in\ntropical forest sites of the Amazon basin. In data collected\nnear Santare\u00b4m, Brazil, there is an inverse relationship\nbetween d13C of ecosystem respiration (d13CR) and monthly\nprecipitation that persists at rain rates up to 300 mm\/month.\nAt much higher rates of precipitation, i.e., greater than\n400 mm\/month, the relationship appears to reverse. They\nargue that at the lower rain rates, changes in d13CR are\ncontrolled by stomatal-induced variations in C3 discrimina-\ntion caused by a combination of soil water stress and\nrelative humidity. It is unclear why discrimination decreases\nat precipitation rates greater than 400 mm\/month. Ometto et\nal. also collected data from a second tropical forest site near\nManaus, Brazil. At Manaus, the relationship between d13CR\nand monthly precipitation is less clear, even though the site\nis similar in many respects to that of Santare\u00b4m.\n[21] We examined the relationship between monthly pre-\ncipitation and C3 discrimination in the simulation for the\ngrid cell containing Santare\u00b4m, Brazil, as well as a temperate\nforest grid cell containing the WLEF tall tower site in\nWisconsin (Figure 6). In the simulation, C3 discrimination\nincreases with increasing monthly precipitation. The rela-\ntionship is slightly nonlinear, with a steeper slope at very\nlow rates of precipitation. In other words, changes in\nFigure 5. Relationship between vapor pressure deficit (vpd), i.e., the difference between saturated water\nvapor pressure and vapor pressure of the canopy air, and d13C of ecosystem respiration (d13CR) by C3\nplants. The two lines are from observations. The data points are from the simulation. The solid line is the\nproposed linear fit to measurements from a mixed coniferous boreal forest in northern Sweden (y =\n0.2242x \u0005 27.3; r2 = 0.94, n = 5) [see Ekblad and Ho\u00a8gberg, 2001, Figure 3]. Meteorologic data were\ncollected at a weather station 200 m from the site. The vpds are calculated from the 2-day mean for\nmaximum air temperature and the 2-day mean relative humidity at the maximum air temperature.\nThe dotted line is a simple logarithmic fit to data proposed by Bowling et al. [2002] (y = 2.54Lnx \u0005 27.8;\nr2 = 0.79, n = 22; see Figure 7). The curve is constructed from 22 points from four sites in Oregon.\nBowling et al. calculated vpd using either on-site instrumentation or data from Oregon Climate service\nstations as near to the site as possible. The d13CR values are constructed from 2-day averages of Keeling\nplot intercepts using geometric mean regressions of nocturnal data. Since there is likely to be a delay\nbetween the time the carbon is photosynthetically fixed and the time that it is respired, in the observations\na time lag was selected by looking for the best statistical fit between d13CR and 2-day mean vpd over\nvarying time periods. Although Ekblad and Ho\u00a8gberg used a 3- to 4-day time lag for the relationship\nbetween d13CR and relative humidity, a 2- to 3-day lag was best for fitting d\n13CR and vpd; Bowling et al.\nused time lags ranging from 5 to 10 days, depending on the site. Data points are from the simulation and\nare mean daily vpd for daylight hours only and assimilation-weighted d13C values. The red solid circles,\nblue stars, and green crosses are from grid boxes in Oregon which are similar to the locations in the\nBowling et al. study. Other data points are from sites and months intended to represent a range of\nconditions from very wet to very dry. The locations are as follows: WLEF (45.5\u0001N, 90.5\u0001W); W\nWyoming (41.5\u0001N, 109.5\u0001W); Manaus (2.5\u0001S, 55.5\u0001W); N Oregon (48.5\u0001N, 124.5\u0001W); and S Oregon\n(43.5\u0001N, 123.5\u0001W). In the simulation, d13C of canopy CO2 is held constant at \u00057.9%.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n10 of 15\nGB1017\nprecipitation rates have a greater impact on carbon isotope\ndiscrimination under very dry conditions than they do when\nthe environment is already wet. Discrimination at WLEF is\nabout 1% less than that predicted for Santare\u00b4m, largely\nbecause of the greater relative humidity of the tropical\nforested site. Model results agree with the observations to\nthe extent that we predict a positive correlation between\nmonthly precipitation and discrimination; however, there\nare several important differences between the model and\nobservations. First, observed d13CR for both Santare\u00b4m and\nManaus is depleted in 13C by up to 2% relative to modeled\ndiscrimination. Second, the slope of the relationship in the\nobservations at Santare\u00b4m is about 3 times greater than\nthe slope predicted for the grid cell containing Santare\u00b4m.\nIn the observations, d13C of ecosystem respiration decreases\nby approximately 3% for changes in precipitation from 50\nto 300 mm\/month; in the simulation, the change is closer to\n1%. Third, at Santare\u00b4m, d13C of ecosystem respiration\nreturns to heavier values at precipitation rates greater than\n400 mm\/month, whereas modeled discrimination continues\nto increase with increasing precipitation rates.\n[22] Reasons for the enrichment in modeled values rela-\ntive to observations at both Santare\u00b4m and Manaus will be\naddressed later in the paper. With respect to the relationship\nbetween discrimination and monthly precipitation, we think\nthat there may be several reasons for the differences\nbetween the model and observations at Santare\u00b4m. First,\nwhile we have no reason to doubt the results of Ometto et\nal. [2002], the question must be asked: Is this site repre-\nsentative of tropical forest behavior in general? Data col-\nlected at Manaus do not refute the relationship observed at\nSantare\u00b4m; however, neither do they confirm it. In part, this\nis because of the narrow range of monthly precipitation\nrates observed at Manaus; however, more data will have to\nbe collected before we can say that the behavior at Santare\u00b4m\nis characteristic of tropical forests in general. A second\npossibility is that there are important natural variations\naccompanying changes in monthly precipitation that are\nnot captured in the model. The two most probable candi-\ndates are relative humidity and\/or soil water. Since SiB2\nseems to do a good job simulating the relationship between\ndiscrimination and vapor pressure deficit, the problem may\nbe with the way that we model soil water stress. Throughout\nthe 11 years of the simulation, there is no significant soil\nwater stress on plant growth in the grid cell containing\nSantare\u00b4m, even during the driest months. Unfortunately, we\nhave no observations to directly compare to the simulation.\nTerrestrial ecosystem models sometimes predict decreases\nin photosynthetic rates during the tropical forest dry season\ndue to drought stress; however, this decline in assimilation\nrates is not always supported by the observations [Tian et\nal., 1998; Saleska et al., 2003]. Finally, there is a similar\nFigure 6. Relationship between monthly precipitation and\nC3 discrimination. Discrimination has been converted from\ndel values using the formula: Discrimination = (d13Cair \u0005\nd13CR)\/(1 \u0005 d13Cair\/1000); where d13Cair = \u00057.9%\nand d13CR is the carbon isotope ratio of ecosystem\nrespiration. Triangles and asterisks are from measurements\nin primary evergreen tropical forests: triangles (Santare\u00b4m,\nBrazil), asterisks (Manaus, Brazil) [see Ometto et al., 2002,\nFigure 7]. The error bars represent the standard error of the\nisotope measurement. The curve is a second-order poly-\nnomial fit to the data from Santare\u00b4m. The open circles are\nsimulated discrimination for the grid box containing\nSantare\u00b4m. Simulated data from Manaus are nearly identical.\nThe solid squares are simulated discrimination for summer\nmonths for the grid box containing WLEF tower in\nWisconsin. The lines through the simulated data are\nlogarithmic fits to the data.\nFigure 7. A comparison between simulated and observed\nd13C values of ecosystem respiration for four forest biome\ntypes. Observations are from the BASIN network [Pataki\net al., 2003]. Error bars are standard deviations.

In general, simulated d13C values are close to\nobserved values although there is slightly less variability in\nsimulated values than in observations. In addition, simu-\nlated d13C values in the tropics are heavy relative to\nobserved values.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n11 of 15\nGB1017\npattern between observed mean carbon isotope composition\nof ecosystem respiration and mean annual precipitation; that\nis, discrimination increases with increasing precipitation up\nto a point, where it then returns to lower values at very high\nrain rates. In the simulation, annually integrated d13C values\nare generally more negative in wet climates, and they do not\nreturn to less negative values in extremely wet climates.\n3.2.3. C3 Discrimination by Biome\n[23] The number of measurements of d13CR that have\nbeen collected is constantly increasing and can serve as an\nadditional method for evaluating simulation results. Data for\nFigure 7 are taken from Pataki et al. [2003] and show mean\nd13CR values and standard deviations for four different\nbiomes: Broadleaf, Temperate Broadleaf, Temperate Coni-\nfer, and Boreal. We have plotted mean d13CR values and\nstandard deviations for comparable biomes from our simu-\nlation against the observed values. In general, simulated\nmean values are relatively close to the observed means, and\nthe standard deviations encompass the range of observed\nvalues. However, there are a couple of important differences\nbetween the simulation and the observations. First, the mean\nmodel d13CR for the tropical forests is 1% less negative than\nthe mean of the observations. If simulated discrimination in\nthe tropical forests is incorrect, it could be the result of a\ncouple of factors. First, our estimate for maximum C3\ndiscrimination (28.2%) may be too small. This could be\nbecause the isotope effect that we use for CO2 fixation with\nRubisco (30%) is not large enough, or because of our\nassumption that 7.5% of the carbon fixed by C3 plants\noccurs through reactions with PEPC is too great. Either one\nis a possibility. Measurements of isotope effects associated\nwith rubisco are precise, but the values range from approx-\nimately 26% to 38% [O\u2019Leary, 1981; Brugnoli and\nFarquhar, 2000]. With respect to the amount of CO2 in\nC3 plants that reacts with PEPC, very little is known.\nA maximum of 10% has been suggested [Raven and\nFarquhar, 1990] and Lloyd and Farquhar [1994] assumed\nthat it was 5%, so perhaps our estimate of 7.5% is too high.\nChanging from 7.5% to 5% reduces discrimination by about\n0.6%. Of course, while the change improves the match to\nobserved d13CR for tropical forests, it hurts the fit with\nBoreal and Temperate Broadleaf biomes. Another possibil-\nity is that there are biome-specific differences in this\nfraction of which we are unaware. A second reason why\nour d13C values for tropical forests are enriched in 13C\nrelative to observations could be due to the fact that we do\nnot include the effects of recycling of isotopically depleted\nrespired CO2. In this study we hold d\n13C of canopy CO2\nconstant at \u00057.9%. Estimates of the amount of respired\nCO2 that is recycled are as high as 30 to 40% [Sternberg et\nal., 1997], although others have argued that it is actually\nquite negligible [Lloyd et al., 1996, 1997]. In sensitivity\ntests in which we coupled the biosphere to a dynamic\ncanopy, recycling was greatest in tropical forests, which is\nconsistent with observations, and caused d13C of assimilated\ncarbon to be depleted in 13C by 1\u20134%. Working against\nthis effect, however, is an offset due to the terrestrial \u2018\u2018Suess\nEffect.\u2019\u2019 On the basis of flux-weighted ages of decomposing\nSOM [Fung et al., 1997] and a long-term record of d13C of\natmospheric CO2 [Francey et al., 1999], the terrestrial Suess\nEffect in tropics is estimated to be about +0.6%, which\nwould counter some of the effects of recycling. A second\nFigure 8. Zonal d13C ratios of terrestrial biosphere from Miller et al. [2003] (data points with error\nbars), Lloyd and Farquhar [1994] (red line), Fung et al. [1997] (green line), and this study (blue line).\nSee color version of this figure at back of this issue.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION\n12 of 15\nGB1017\nand perhaps more important difference between the obser-\nvations and the model is that there appears to be a wider\nrange of values in the observations than in the model.\nUnfortunately, there are still so few observations that it is\ndifficult to know how representative they are. Nonetheless,\nit is entirely possible that the wider range of values in the\nobservations is due to heterogeneity within biomes that is\nnot captured by the model.\n3.2.4. Zonal Trends in D13C of Plant Carbon\nCompared to Atmospheric Data\n[24] Results of the simulation can also be compared to\natmospheric data. Miller et al. [2003] have analyzed high-\nfrequency deviations from a seasonal spline fit to time series\nof CO2 and d\n13C measurements from continental stations\nfrom the NOAA Globalview Flask Network in order to\ndeduce the carbon isotopic ratios of growing season CO2\nfluxes in the Northern Hemisphere. They argue that these\ndeviations from the seasonal signal are produced by fluxes\nto and from the local vegetation and are therefore a record\nof the isotopic ratio of that vegetation. Miller et al. have\nplotted the d13C values from these sites as a function of\nlatitude, as well as zonal mean d13C values from Fung et al.\n[1997] and Lloyd and Farquhar [1994]. Their figure is\nrecreated here with the addition of our zonal mean assim-\nilation-weighted d13C values for the Northern Hemisphere\ngrowing season (Figure 8). While it is difficult to make a\ndirect comparison, because the observations largely repre-\nsent regional values of terrestrial discrimination, it appears\nthat our zonal mean is an improvement over previous\nsimulations in that it captures some of the flatness of the\nsignal between 20\u0001N and 40\u0001N, as well as the rapid descent\nto more negative values north of 40\u0001N. Furthermore,\nalthough we are still limited by a paucity of data, both\nobservations and simulated results indicate that spatial\ndistribution of d13C values of the terrestrial biosphere are\nmore complex than previously thought.\n4. Conclusion\n[25] A multistage model of carbon isotope discrimination\nduring photosynthesis and global maps of C3\/C4 plant\nratios coupled to an ecophysiological model of the terres-\ntrial biosphere driven by observed meteorology and con-\nstrained by satellite-derived NDVI has been used to predict\nthe carbon isotope ratios of terrestrial plant carbon. Simu-\nlated mean annual C3 discrimination for 1983\u20131993 is\n19.2%; total mean annual discrimination by the terrestrial\nbiosphere (C3 and C4 plants) is 15.9%.\n[26] It is very difficult to constrain the details of the\nsimulated results because we are still sorely lacking in\nobservations. However, within these limitations we find\nthe following. The modeled response to changes in vapor\npressure deficit compares favorably to observations. Simu-\nlated monthly discrimination in tropical forests is less\nsensitive to changes in precipitation than is suggested by\nsome observation. Mean model d13C ratios for Broadleaf,\nTemperate Broadleaf, Temperate Conifer, and Boreal bio-\nmes compare well with the few measurements available;\nhowever, there is more variability in observations than in\nthe simulation, and modeled d13C values for tropical forests\nappear heavy relative to observations. Finally, simulated\nzonal d13C ratios in the Northern Hemisphere capture the\ncomplexity of the zonal d13C inferred from atmospheric\nmeasurements better than previous investigations.\n[27] Acknowledgments.

(a) Mean annual assimilation-weighted d13C of terrestrial plant carbon from an 11-year simulation (1983\u20131993)\nand (b) standard deviation in annual d13C values. During each time step, net assimilation is multiplied by the d13C of\nassimilated plant carbon. At the end of the year, the sum of net assimilation times d13C is divided by total annual net\nassimilation to give the d13C value of carbon assimilated in each grid cell during that calendar year. The mean is the average\nof the 11 annual values. The standard deviation is also for those 11 values. Please note the higher resolution used in\nreporting more negative mean values (Figure 4a). This is done in order to highlight spatial variations in C3 discrimination.\nThere is tremendous spatial variability in d13C values of terrestrial carbon. The sharpest spatial contrasts are the result of\ndifferences in C3\/C4 ratios. Variation in d13C values of C3 plants is largely driven by differences in relative humidity during\nthe growing season. Larger than average standard deviations are found in areas where ECMWF predicts significant\nvariations in annual precipitation.\nGB1017 SUITS ET AL.: CARBON ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION GB1017\n12 of 15\nFigure 8.
