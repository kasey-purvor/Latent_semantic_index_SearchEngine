Chromosomal attachment of microtubules is\nmediated by kinetochores. These are elaborate structures\nthat are assembled during mitotic prophase and that contain\nmultiple protein species, including cell cycle regulatory\nmolecules and microtubule motor proteins. Formation of\neach kinetochore takes place at the centromere, a chromosomal\nsite enriched in a group of centromere-specific proteins\n(CENPs), which includes CENP-A (a histone H3-like\nmolecule) as well as CENP-B and CENP-C (Cleveland et\nal., 2003). Mature kinetochores appear as flat trilaminar\nplate-like structures that are able to capture the plus ends of\nspindle microtubules. In vertebrate cells, the mitotic spindle\nis an exclusively cytoplasmic structure. Consequently, for\nchromosomes enclosed within a nucleus to gain access to\nspindle microtubules, the nuclear envelope (NE) must be\neither partially or completely broken down.\nIn all eukaryotes, the NE features a pair of inner and outer\nnuclear membranes that are joined in places where they are\nspanned by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (Gerace and\nBurke, 1988; Gant and Wilson, 1997). Metazoan NEs\ncontain an additional structural element, the nuclear lamina,\nwhich is associated with the nuclear face of the inner nuclear\nmembrane. The lamina consists of a thin (20\u201350 nm) filamen-\ntous meshwork composed primarily of A- and B-type nuclear\nlamin proteins (Gerace and Burke, 1988; Gant and Wilson,\n1997). During mitosis in mammalian somatic cells, the\nnuclear lamina and NPCs are disassembled. At the same\ntime, nuclear membrane components disperse within the\nER, which itself exhibits numerous connections with the\nouter nuclear membrane (Ellenberg et al., 1997; Yang et al.,\n1997; Ostlund et al., 1999). Disassembly of the lamina and\nNPCs occurs in response to phosphorylation of both lamina\nand NPC subunits (Gerace and Blobel, 1980; Heald and\nMcKeon, 1990; Macaulay et al., 1995). Although the majority\nof these components become distributed throughout the\nmitotic cytoplasm, certain NPC proteins (nucleoporins or\nNups) and associated molecules, including Rae1, Nup107, and\nNup133, become preferentially associated with kinetochores\n(Belgareh et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001; Babu et al., 2003).\nAnother nucleoporin, Nup358, which is a component of the\nshort (100 nm) filaments that extend from the cytoplasmic\n \nAddress correspondence to Brian Burke, Department of Anatomy and\nCell Biology, University of Florida, 1600 SW Archer Road, Gainesville,\nFL 32610-0235.

This\nrelocation occurs in association with Ran GTPase activating\nprotein 1 (RanGAP1), a molecule with which Nup358 also\ninteracts during interphase. Conversely, certain mitotic\ncheckpoint proteins, such as Mad1 and Mad2, that are ki-\nnetochore associated during mitosis are found at the nuclear\nface of NPCs during interphase (Campbell et al., 2001). In\nyeast, this localization is mediated by Nup53p, part of a\nlarger complex of NPC proteins that includes Nup157p and\nNup170p (Iouk et al., 2002). Remarkably, yeast strains defi-\ncient in Mad1p exhibit a reduced rate of nuclear protein im-\nport as well as decreased stability of the Nup53p complex\n(Iouk et al., 2002). The implication is that there is a func-\ntional relationship between the mitotic apparatus and the\nNE. However, the significance of this has only recently be-\ncome a focus of investigation.\nThe interplay between the NE and the mitotic spindle is\nfurther highlighted by findings that the spindle itself plays\nan active role in nuclear membrane dispersal during pro-\nmetaphase (Beaudouin et al., 2002; Salina et al., 2002). The\nentire process is driven by cytoplasmic dynein, a microtu-\nbule minus end\u2013directed motor protein, which concentrates\non the NE during late G2\/early prophase (Salina et al.,\n2002). By engaging with spindle microtubules, NE-linked\ndynein causes the deformation and rupture of the nuclear\nmembranes, leading to release of the condensed chromo-\nsomes into the cytoplasm. This process, in effect, represents\na mechanical checkpoint because it provides a means to de-\nlay NE breakdown (NEBD) until functional spindle micro-\ntubules have been assembled.\nAlthough the identity of the dynein-binding partner on\nthe NE remains unknown, cytoplasmically exposed NPC\nsubunits have been suggested as possible candidates. One\nsuch protein, Nup358, is of particular interest because it is\nknown to associate with both the mitotic spindle and kinet-\nochores. To determine whether Nup358 does indeed play a\nrole in early mitotic progression, we employed an siRNA ap-\nproach to deplete cells of this particular nucleoporin. Al-\nthough we were unable to find any evidence for an involve-\nment in dynein binding and NEBD (unpublished data), we\ndid observe a surprising effect on chromosome congression.\nOur data suggest that Nup358 plays an essential role in ki-\nnetochore function and chromatid segregation.\n \nResults\n \nExamination of HeLa cell cultures exposed to Nup358\nsiRNA reveals a series of striking changes that occur over a\nperiod of several days. During the first 24\u201348 h of siRNA\ntreatment, an accumulation of prometaphase cells becomes\napparent (Fig. 1 B). By 120 h, this reaches a peak of almost\n50% of the total mitotic population, a threefold increase in\nthe frequency of prometaphase cells over that observed in\nmock-treated cultures (Fig. 1 B). A second population of\ncells, characterized by the presence of multiple micronuclei\n(Fig. 1 A), emerges between 24 and 96 h. This very unusual\nmorphology is rarely encountered in control cultures and is\na characteristic feature of Nup358 siRNA treatment. It is\nnot observed after depletion of other nucleoporins such as\nNup153 (unpublished data) or when ineffective RNA oligo-\nnucleotides are used. As there is a progressive increase in\napoptosis leading to a decline in the number of cells contain-\ning micronuclei after \n \n\u0002\n \n120 h of Nup358 siRNA treatment\n(Fig. 1 C), the majority of our subsequent experiments were\nperformed on cells exposed to Nup358 siRNA for a maxi-\nmum of 96 h.\nImmunoblot analysis of HeLa cultures subjected to\nNup358 siRNA treatment for a period of 4 d reveals a de-\ncline in the level of Nup358 of \n \n\u0002\n \n50% when compared with\nmock-treated cells (Fig. 2, A and B).

The latter reach a peak at 120 h, at which time \nthey account for almost 50% of the total mitotic population (B). \nA gradual increase in apoptosis, peaking at 120 h, is also observed \n(C).

These\nmeasurements revealed an average decline in Nup358-asso-\nciated fluorescence of \n \n\u0002\n \n60%, a value that is consistent\nwith the immunoblot data (Fig. 2 C). At the single cell\nlevel, fluorescence intensity reductions of 80% or more\ncould be observed. Cells containing multiple micronuclei\nexhibited an average reduction in anti-Nup358 fluores-\ncence intensity of \n \n\u0002\n \n77% when compared with mock-treated\ncells (Fig. 2 C).\nLoss of Nup358 had little, if any, effect on NPC number,\nas estimated in immunofluorescence experiments using a va-\nriety of antinucleoporin antibodies. Nup153 (Fig. 2 C and\nFig. 3 A) and other FG-repeat nucleoporins, including the\nNPC membrane protein POM121, remained NE associated\nand retained their usual punctate distribution (unpublished\ndata). Puncta per unit NE surface remained essentially un-\nchanged after siRNA treatment (unpublished data). Distri-\nbution of another nucleoporin, Nup214, which resides on\nthe cytoplasmic face of the NPC, appears largely unaffected\nin cells, including multinucleate cells, depleted of Nup358\n(Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained for Nup98, a mobile\nnucleoporin that, like Nup153, is localized to the nuclear\nface of the NPC (unpublished data). EM analysis of multi-\nnucleate cells from siRNA-treated cultures (such cells are al-\nways depleted of Nup358; Fig. 2 C and Fig. 3 D) revealed\nnumerous NPCs (Fig. 3 B). However, the presence or ab-\nsence of NPC-associated cytoplasmic filaments could not be\nreliably ascertained in this type of thin section analysis.\nTaken together, these data indicate that NPCs remain sub-\nstantially intact after Nup358 depletion in vivo.\nNup358-depleted nuclei, including micronuclei, retained\nthe capacity to import both A-type lamins (Fig. 3 D) and\nan inducible (by dexamethasone) nuclear transport substrate,\na glucocorticoid receptor\u2013\n \n\u0002\n \n-galactosidase fusion protein\n(GR\n \n\u0002\n \n; Fig. 4, A and B). In the case of the latter, import was\nfollowed over time in both mock-treated cells and in cells\ndepleted of Nup358. For this experiment, cells were double\nlabeled with antibodies against both Nup358 and \n \n\u0002\n \n-galac-\ntosidase. In this way, cells specifically depleted of Nup358\ncould be scored for nuclear accumulation of GR\n \n\u0002\n \n. As shown\nin Fig. 4 B, Nup358 depletion had little or no effect on the\nnuclear uptake of GR\n \n\u0002\n \n. In addition, there were no obvious\nchanges in the gross distribution of the import receptor im-\nportin\/karyopherin-\n \n\u0002\n \n (Fig. 4 C) in mock-treated versus\nNup358-depleted multinucleate cells. These observations\nare consistent with recent findings that nuclei assembled in\nvitro in the absence of Nup358 contain functional NPCs\nand are import competent (Walther et al., 2002).\nThe accumulation of \u201cprometaphase\u201d cells after 96 h of\nsiRNA treatment is associated with abnormal or ineffective\ncongression of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. Al-\nthough centrosome separation appears to occur on schedule,\nsome perturbation of spindle morphology is evident. Often,\nspindles associated with Nup358 siRNA treatment appeared\nelongated or somewhat irregular. On average, pole-to-pole\ndistance was increased by \n \n\u0002\n \n16% in Nup358 siRNA\u2013treated\nversus control cells. The chromosome congression defect,\nobserved in the majority of prometaphase cells at the 96-h\ntime point, is manifest as a trimodal distribution of chromo-\nsomes with irregular, largely nonaligned clusters at the spin-\ndle equator as well as smaller clusters over either pole (Fig. 4\nA). These cells showed a mean reduction in anti-Nup358\u2013\nassociated fluorescence intensity of \n \n\u0002\n \n60% (Fig. 4 B). This\nvery unusual chromosome distribution is rarely observed in\nuntreated cultures or in cultures depleted of another nucle-\noporin, Nup153 (unpublished data). However, such a phe-\nnotype is observed after depletion of several spindle-, ki-\nnetochore-, and centromere-associated proteins, including\n \nDrosophila\n \n MAST\/Orbit, CENP-A, CENP-E, and hMis12\n(Yao et al., 2000; McEwen et al., 2001; Maiato et al., 2002;\nPutkey et al., 2002; Goshima et al., 2003).\nFigure 2. Cells containing multiple micronuclei are depleted of \nNup358. A single high molecular weight band is recognized on a \nWestern blot of a HeLa whole cell extract by the anti-Nup358 \nantibodies that are employed in this study (A). Total protein content \nof the cell extract is shown in the Coomassie blue\u2013stained lane (gel). \nMolecular weight markers (MW, kD) are indicated on the left. A \n50% reduction in total Nup358 levels in Nup358 siRNA\u2013treated \n(RNAi) versus control cultures (Mock) is shown by quantitative \nWestern blot analysis (B). For this experiment, twofold dilution \nseries of HeLa cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot using \nantibodies against Nup358 (A) as well as \u0002-tubulin as an internal \nstandard. Two sample pairs (differing in concentration by a factor of \ntwo) from both control and siRNA-treated cultures are shown. \nChanges in Nup358 levels were determined from the ratios of the \nNup358\/\u0002-tubulin band intensities. These experiments were \nperformed in quadruplicate over a 16-fold sample concentration \nrange. Immunofluorescence microscopy of Nup358 siRNA\u2013treated \ncultures reveals a loss of NE-associated Nup358 (C). This is \nparticularly evident in cells containing multiple micronuclei. A \nsecond nucleoporin, Nup153, shows no such decline. Fluorescence \nintensity measurements performed on randomly selected interphase \ncells (Total) indicate a 66% reduction in Nup358 levels (\u00035%; \nP \u0004 0.001) in siRNA-treated versus control (Mock) cells. A larger \naverage reduction in anti-Nup358 fluorescence intensity of 77% \n(\u00031%; P \u0004 0.001) is observed when measurements are restricted to \ncells containing multiple micronuclei (MN).

In these cells, an NE\nreforms around individual chromosomes and groups of chro-\nmosomes, giving rise to the multiple micronuclei described\nabove. These cells invariably show reduced labeling with anti-\nNup358 antibodies (Fig. 2 C and Fig. 3 D). Surprisingly,\nmany of these cells form an intracellular bridge and undergo\ncytokinesis (Fig. 5 C). Indeed at the 96-h time point, \n \n\u0002\n \n34%\nof \u201ctelophase\u201d or early G1 cells (defined by the presence of an\nintracellular bridge) were found to contain multiple micro-\nnuclei. Few such cells were observed in corresponding mock-\ntreated populations. The ultimate fate of these unusual cells\nseems to be death, because, as pointed out above, the fre-\nquency of apoptosis increases steadily up to 5 d after siRNA\ntreatment. After this time point, the occurrence of cells con-\ntaining multiple micronuclei generally declines (Fig. 1 B).\nRemarkably, a virtually identical effect, including micronu-\nclear formation and aberrant cytokinesis, has recently been\nreported in cells depleted of CENP-A and hMis12, a human\nkinetochore protein (Goshima et al., 2003).\nFurther analyses of arrested cells after 96 h of siRNA treat-\nment suggest that congression failure is due, at least partially,\nto defects at the kinetochore. A role for Nup358 in kineto-\nchore function is suggested by work from Joseph et al.\n(2002), who have shown that a population of Nup358 is lo-\ncalized at kinetochores during mitosis. We have been able to\nconfirm this observation, as well as show that Nup358 is as-\nsociated, at least in part, with the outer portion of the kinet-\nochore (Fig. 6). This localization was concluded from double\nlabel experiments using anti-Nup358 in combination with\neither an anticentromere human autoimmune serum (ACA;\nFig. 6 A) or an antibody against CENP-F, a protein of the\nkinetochore fibrous corona (Fig. 6 B). Anti-Nup358 kineto-\nchore labeling is clearly reduced in siRNA-treated cells (Fig.\n6 C). We therefore examined the distribution, in arrested\ncells, of a number of components that normally associate\ntransiently with mitotic kinetochores. These include dynein,\nCENP-E, CENP-F, the mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad1\nand Mad2, and Zw10. None of these proteins show their\nnormal mitotic distribution. Instead, they exhibit aberrant\nkinetochore targeting and many are partially or completely\nmislocalized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, A and B). Fluorescence\nintensity measurements indicate a reduction in kinetochore-\nassociated CENP-E, CENP-F, Mad-1, and dynein of \n \n\u0002\n \n60%\nusing ACA labeling as an internal reference (Fig. 7 B).

Cell cycle invariant kinetochore components, includ-\ning those that are recognized by the ACA serum, do show an\nappropriate localization (Fig. 7 A) and are found on both po-\nlar and equatorial clusters. The implication of these observa-\ntions is that Nup358 is required for the normal assembly of\nproteins at the kinetochore and hence for kinetochore func-\ntion. This view is reinforced and expanded by ultrastructural\nanalysis of kinetochores in prometaphase cells that accumu-\nlate during 4 d of siRNA treatment.\nIn contrast to the normal plate-like trilaminar kinetochore\nstructure that is observed in control or mock-treated cultures\n(Fig. 7 C, a), siRNA-treated cells exhibit a variety of very un-\nusual kinetochore morphologies (Fig. 7 C, b\u2013d). In particu-\nlar, the kinetochores in these cells may form a plate that is\neverted into a \u201cC\u201d shape (in thin section) and that fails to at-\ntain a compact trilaminar structure (Fig. 7 C, d). Alterna-\ntively the plate may be absent entirely so that the kineto-\nchore appears as a diffuse mass of material similar to that\ndescribed for prekinetochores in untreated cells (Fig. 7 C, b\nand c). Both of these kinetochore morphologies are often as-\nsociated with centromeric hetrochromatin that shows anom-\nalous condensation. It seems likely that these two morpholo-\ngies result from the partial or complete disruption of normal\nkinetochore formation. Thus far, we have been unable to\nmake any correlation between the appearance of these aber-\nrant kinetochore morphologies and chromosome location\nwithin the cell. Few microtubules impinge upon the aberrant\nkinetochores, indicating that they are defective with respect\nto microtubule capture (Fig. 7 C, b\u2013d). This loss of kineto-\nchore organization can account for the trimodal distribution\nof chromosomes that is characteristic of Nup358 siRNA\u2013\ntreated prometaphase cells. The majority of chromosomes,\ncontaining defective kinetochores, remains clustered and\nnonaligned (Fig. 6 C) at the cell center flanked by a pair of\nFigure 4. Nuclei in cells depleted of \nNup358 are import competent. Nuclear \nimport of GR\u0002 is unaffected in Nup358 \nsiRNA\u2013treated (RNAi) versus mock-treated \ncells. In the absence of dexamethasone \n(\u0006Dex), GR\u0002 remains almost exclusively \ncytoplasmic (A). After exposure to dexa-\nmethasone for 10 min (\u0007Dex), GR\u0002 relocates \nto the nucleus (or micronuclei). To establish \na time course of GR\u0002 import (B), cells were \nscored for nuclear accumulation of GR\u0002. \nThis was defined as average nuclear fluo-\nrescence intensity greater than average \ncytoplasmic intensity. The graph (B) repre-\nsents the mean of four experiments in which \n200 cells were scored at each time point. \nFor the RNAi samples, only cells clearly \ndepleted of Nup358 were included in the \ncounts.

Only the few chromosomes that do assemble\nkinetochores, and are capable of capturing microtubules, are\nable to migrate to either pole. These gross aberrations in ki-\nnetochore morphology and function clearly indicate that\nNup358 plays an essential role in early mitotic progression.\nA final issue that arises is whether Nup358 itself might\nhave a role as a spindle assembly checkpoint protein. To ad-\ndress this, we examined the effects of simultaneous depletion\nof Nup358 and the bona fide checkpoint protein Mad1 (Fig.\n8). Depletion of Mad1 has previously been shown to result in\npremature anaphase and the appearance of lagging chromo-\nsomes (Luo et al., 2002; Martin-Lluesma et al., 2002). The\nprediction is that if the spindle assembly checkpoint remains\nfunctional in Nup358-depleted cells, then loss of Mad1\nshould result in a decline in the number of prometaphase\/\nmetaphase cells. At the same time, given the Nup358-associ-\nated congression defect, there should be an increase in the\nnumber of cells containing multiple micronuclei. As shown\nin Fig. 8, this is precisely what occurs. In cultures depleted\nonly of Nup358, there is a 70% increase in the number\nmetaphase and premetaphase cells over mock-treated cul-\ntures. It must be emphasized that this figure represents a\nminimum value, given the heterogeneity of the Nup358\nsiRNA\u2013treated cells. If we had only counted cells overtly de-\npleted of Nup358, this increase would be on the order of\n150\u2013300%. Simultaneous depletion of both Nup358 and\nMad1 yielded a sevenfold decline in the number of meta-\nphase and premetaphase cells (compared with Nup358 de-\npletion alone). Taken together, these results indicate that\nNup358 is unlikely to possess a checkpoint function.\n \nDiscussion\n \nNup358, also known as Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2), is\na very large protein that is a core component of the 100-nm\nfilaments that extend from the cytoplasmic face of NPCs\n(Yokoyama et al., 1995; Walther et al., 2002). The Nup358\nmolecule contains numerous FG repeats that have been\nshown to form binding sites for transport receptors of the\nimportin\/karyopherin-\n \n\u0002\n \n family (Delphin et al., 1997). Early\nstudies on the mechanisms of signal-mediated nuclear pro-\ntein import revealed that import substrates bearing NLSs ini-\ntially docked at the cytoplasmic filaments before translo-\ncation across the NPC (Richardson et al., 1988; Pant\u00e9\nand Aebi, 1996). Taken together, these results imply that\nNup358 represents an early docking site for NLS-bearing\nproteins associated with their cognate receptors. Nup358\nalso binds RanGAP1, the activating protein for Ran, a small\nRas-related GTPase that is an important regulator of nucleo-\ncytoplasmic transport (Saitoh et al., 1997). Only RanGAP1\nmolecules that have been modified with the small ubiquitin-\nlike protein SUMO associate with Nup358 at the nuclear\nperiphery (Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1998). In-\ntriguingly, Nup358 itself has SUMO E3 ligase activity\n(Pichler et al., 2002). In this way, Nup358 might act not just\nas a docking protein but also as a regulator, albeit indirect, of\nthe cytoplasmic levels of Ran-GDP versus Ran-GTP. It\ntherefore comes as some surprise that Nup358 is apparently\ndispensable with respect to nucleocytoplasmic transport.\nNuclei assembled in vitro in \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts depleted of\nNup358 are transport competent, although the NPCs\nwithin these nuclei lack cytoplasmic filaments (Walther et\nal., 2002). Whether the kinetics of import in vitro are af-\nfected by elimination of Nup358 is not clear. However,\nthese results are consistent with our own findings that deple-\ntion, albeit incomplete, of Nup358 in HeLa cells has no pro-\nfound affect on the uptake of proteins into the nucleus.\nAlthough we observed little effect on nuclear protein im-\nport in Nup358 siRNA\u2013treated HeLa cells, the effects on\nmitotic progression were quite dramatic. We noted the\nemergence of two unusual cell populations: prometaphase\ncells in which there was a failure in chromosome congression\nand interphase cells containing multiple micronuclei. The\nmost reasonable explanation for the appearance of these cell\npopulations is a failure of spindle microtubules to capture\nchromosomes followed eventually by mitotic exit and NE\nreformation around dispersed chromosomes or groups of\nchromosomes. In this way, the defective prometaphase cells\nwould represent the precursors of the multinucleate cells.\nFigure 5.

In many anaphase\nand telophase cells in 4-d siRNA-treated cultures, the pres-\nence of lagging chromosomes and chromatin strands span-\nning the intracellular bridge is yet further indication of con-\ngression failure and eventual mitotic exit.\nThe findings that Nup358 is associated with both spindle\nmicrotubules and kinetochores in mitotic cells are consistent\nwith a number of recent studies that have revealed a direct\nrole for components of the Ran system in mitotic spindle as-\nsembly. Members of the importin\/karyopherin family are\nalso implicated in these processes. A role for Nup358 in chro-\nmatid segregation has been highlighted in a recent study on\n \nCaenorhabditis\n \n \n \nelegans\n \n early embryos (Askjaer et al., 2002).\nAn RNA interference approach has revealed that depletion of\nNup358\/RanBP2 leads to inhibition of chromosome con-\ngression associated with aberrant spindle morphology, very\nsimilar to the situation described here in HeLa cells. Al-\nthough asters do form, chromosome capture does not occur\nand bipolar spindles are not seen. Identical effects have also\nbeen observed in \n \nC. elegans\n \n embryos that have been depleted\nof CENP-A, a protein required for normal kinetochore for-\nmation (Oegema et al., 2001). These observations confirm a\nrole for kinetochores in spindle organization and indicate\nthat Nup358 depletion could be interfering with either ki-\nnetochore or spindle microtubule function, or indeed both.\nClearly, defects in either of these structures could in principle\ngive rise to the types of aberrations in chromatid segregation\nthat both we and Askjaer et al. (2002) have observed.\nTaken together, our data suggest that the primary effects\nof Nup358 depletion on spindle assembly and function are\noperating at the level of kinetochore formation and matura-\ntion. EM studies of Nup358-depleted prometaphase cells re-\nveal aberrant kinetochore morphology that features partial\nor complete loss of the trilaminar plate structure as well as\nincomplete condensation of subjacent centromeric hetero-\nchromatin. The C-shaped kinetochore morphology has also\nbeen reported after premature chromatin condensation in\ncell fusion experiments (Rattner and Wang, 1992), as well as\nafter exposure to caffeine (Brinkley et al., 1988), whereas the\nexpanded morphology is characteristic of prekinetochores\n(He and Brinkley, 1996). Of particular significance is our\nfinding that certain kinetochore components, including the\ncheckpoint proteins Mad1, Mad2, and Zw10, are mislocal-\nized in prometaphase cells depleted of Nup358. Studies by\nChan et al. (2000) using an antibody microinjection strategy\nhave demonstrated quite convincingly that interference with\nFigure 6.

More recently, Yao et al. (2000)\nhave shown that depletion of CENP-E in mammalian cells\ngives rise to a spectrum of anomalies that is virtually identi-\ncal to what we have reported in this paper. This is consistent\nwith our own finding that CENP-E is mislocalized in\nNup358-depleted cells. Very similar defects have also been\nreported in studies involving depletion of several other ki-\nnetochore proteins, including Hec1, hMis12, and \n \nDrosoph-\nila\n \n Mast\/Orbit (Maiato et al., 2002; Martin-Lluesma et al.,\n2002; Goshima et al., 2003).\nThe finding that depletion of Nup358 perturbs kineto-\nchore structure and interferes with microtubule binding\nsuggests that Nup358 has an important function in the as-\nsembly of the kinetochore. Such a role for Nup358 might\nbe related to its ability to attract and bind other proteins of\nthe Ran system. Indeed, RanGap1 and SUMO-I have both\nbeen found at the kinetochore (Joseph et al., 2002). Given\nthat SUMO-modified RanGAP1 binds Nup358 at the\nNPC, it is tempting to imagine that Nup358 performs a\nsimilar function at the kinetochore during mitosis. In fact,\na population of Ran is found at the kinetochore during\nmitosis while its nucleotide exchange factor, RCC1, re-\nmains chromatin associated (Moore et al., 2002). In \n \nC\n \n. \n \nele-\ngans\n \n, depletion of RCC1 by RNA interference produces ef-\nfects similar, although less severe, to those observed after\nNup358 depletion (Askjaer et al., 2002). As Ran has been\nshown to be essential for kinetochore\u2013microtubule interac-\ntion, these various Ran system components could well\nfunction to modulate the cycling of proteins on and off the\nkinetochore. Interference with one branch of the Ran sys-\ntem might then result in the structural and compositional\ndefects detected in our study. Such a view is lent consider-\nable support by the recent findings of Arnaoutov and\nDasso (2003) on the critical role of the Ran GTPase in\nFigure 7. Nup358 siRNAi treatment causes changes in both kinetochore composition and morphology in prometaphase cells. Double \nindirect immunofluorescence microscopy of mitotic HeLa cells reveals that multiple proteins are lost from kinetochores in Nup358 siRNA\u2013 \nversus mock-treated cells (A). These include CENP-E, CENP-F, dynein, and Mad1 (A) as well as Mad2 and Zw10 (B; siRNA-treated cell \npopulations are represented by light gray bars, whereas dark gray indicates control populations). Occasional kinetochore labeling is observed \nwith antibodies against these various components (A). This is invariably associated with polar chromosome clusters and not with the larger \nequatorial clusters. This is particularly evident in the CENP-E and CENP-F panels (A). Electron micrographs (C) of the kinetochores of control (a) \nversus siRNA-treated cells (b\u2013d).

A second possibility is that since\nNup358 is a SUMO ligase (Pichler et al., 2002), this activ-\nity might be required for proper kinetochore organization\nand function. In this regard, it is intriguing that SUMO-1\ncan act as a suppressor of certain CENP-C mutations in\nvertebrate cells (Fukagawa et al., 2001).\nOur findings clearly indicate that Nup358 has an impor-\ntant role in the recruitment of kinetochore proteins, includ-\ning those involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint.\nHowever, Nup358 itself appears unlikely to be a checkpoint\nprotein per se. Rather, our data suggest that the spindle as-\nsembly checkpoint remains substantially intact in cells de-\npleted of Nup358, and that such cells display only a rela-\ntively slow escape from the mitotic arrest. This escape could,\nhowever, be accelerated by codepletion of Mad1. Con-\nversely, nocodazole treatment of both mock- and Nup358-\ndepleted cells yielded little difference in the numbers of cells\narrested in prometaphase (unpublished data). Given the sub-\nstantial, albeit incomplete, mislocalization of kinetochore-\nassociated proteins in cells depleted of Nup358, these results\ninvolving Mad1 codepletion are consistent with the notion\nthat checkpoint complexes may remain functional at other\ncytoplasmic sites.\nCould Nup358 depletion be having an indirect effect on\nkinetochore function? We know that Nup358 is part of the\nnucleocytoplasmic transport machinery. It is formally possi-\nble, therefore, that the mitotic defects we have observed\ncould be a consequence of failure to import crucial kineto-\nchore components into the nucleus in late G2. This sce-\nnario, however, seems very unlikely. All the evidence that\nwe and others have available suggests that nuclear protein\nimport is not seriously perturbed by Nup358 depletion\n(Walther et al., 2002). Indeed, if it were, we would expect\ncells to arrest in interphase and not to enter mitosis. Given\nits localization during mitosis, the most reasonable model re-\nmains that Nup358 is actually functional at the kinetochore.\nWhy should NPC or NE components play any role at all\nduring mitosis? Joseph et al. (2002) have made the interest-\ning proposal that the reciprocal relationship between the\nNPC and the mitotic spindle, represented by the cycling of\nproteins between these two structures, provides a fail-safe\nsignal that defines the interphase versus mitotic status of the\ncell. Our data on Nup358 would suggest that this idea can\nalso be extended to the kinetochore, which can only become\nfunctional once NEBD, disassembly of NPCs, and transfer\nof some NPC components to the kinetochores has com-\nmenced. In this way, an orderly and stepwise progression of\nmitotic events is ensured. This relationship between the\nNPC (or at least the NE) and the kinetochore may have its\nroots in the evolutionary history of these two structures.\nMany primitive cell types that undergo a closed mitosis, di-\nnoflagellates for example, have well-differentiated kineto-\nchores that remain closely associated with the nuclear surface\nof the NE (Kubai, 1975; Ris, 1975). In \n \nTrichonympha\n \n \n \nagilis\n \n,\nspindle microtubules, which are exclusively cytoplasmic,\nmake contact not with the kinetochore itself, but with the\npatch of nuclear membrane that overlies the kinetochore\n(Kubai, 1975). In this way, chromosome segregation, although\ndriven by the mitotic spindle, is actually mediated by NE com-\nponents. It is possible that this mechanism has been conserved\nin organisms that have evolved an open mitosis such that disas-\nsembled NE components still maintain their ancient role.\n \nMaterials and methods\n \nCell culture\n \nHeLa cells were maintained at 7.5% CO\n \n2\n \n and 37\n \n\b\n \nC in DME (GIBCO BRL)\nplus 10% FBS (Hyclone), 10% penicillin\/streptomycin (GIBCO BRL), and 2\nmM glutamine.\n \nAntibodies\n \nThe following antibodies were used in this study.

Double indirect immunofluorescence microscopy \nof HeLa cell cultures treated with Nup358 and\/or Mad1 siRNAs and labeled with antibodies against both Nup358 and Mad1 (A). In interphase \ncells, Mad1, like Nup358, localizes almost exclusively to the nuclear periphery. Depletion of either protein in interphase cells has little or no \neffect on the distribution of the other. During mitosis, Nup358 depletion results in a significant (70%) increase in the number of premetaphase \nand metaphase cells over mock-treated cultures (B). This effect is reversed by codepletion of Mad1.

Polymerization was\nperformed at 60\n \n\b\n \nC for 24 h. Silver-gray sections were cut using a Leica ul-\ntramicrotome equipped with a diamond knife. The sections were stained\nwith uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a JEOL JEM-100CXII\nelectron microscope.\n \nIn vivo nuclear import assay\n \nTo examine the effects of Nup358 depletion on nuclear protein import,\nHeLa cells, grown on glass coverslips, were exposed to Nup358 siRNA for\n3 d. At this time, the cells were transfected with an expression plasmid en-\ncoding GR\n \n\u0002\n \n (Picard and Yamamoto, 1987). Transfections were performed\nusing Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recom-\nmendations. 24 h after transfection, dexamethasone was added to the me-\ndium to a final concentration of 10 \n \n\u0005\n \ng\/ml. The cells were returned to the\nincubator for a period of up to 30 min and then fixed with 3% formalde-\nhyde in PBS. Finally, The cells were processed for immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy using antibodies against both \n \n\u0002\n \n-galactosidase and Nup358.\n \nsiRNA methods\n \nHeLa cells were depleted of Nup358 using siRNA corresponding to nucle-\notides 7632\u20137654 of human Nup358 (Dharmacon). The cells were ex-\nposed to the Nup358 siRNA in the presence of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen)\nprecisely as described by Harborth et al. (2001). As a control, cells were\nexposed either to Oligofectamine alone, to Nup153 siRNA, or to an inef-\nfective RNA duplex. For Mad1 depletion, the procedures and oligonucle-\notide sequences described by Martin-Lluesma et al. (2002) were followed\nprecisely. In codepletion experiments, cells were first exposed to Nup358\nsiRNA. After 48 h, a combination of both Mad1 and Nup358 siRNAs was\nintroduced to the cells. After an additional 48 h incubation, the cells were\nfixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy.\n \nImmunoblotting and gel electrophoresis\n \nCells (siRNA or mock treated) grown in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were\nwashed once in PBS and then lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl,\npH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and\n1:1,000 CLAP (10 mg\/ml in DMSO of each of the following: chymostatin,\nleupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin). The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min in\nan Eppendorf centrifuge at 4\n \n\b\n \nC. Proteins in the supernatant were precipi-\ntated by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of 10%. The precipi-\ntate was washed with ethanol\/ether and then solubilized in sodium do-\ndecyl sulfate\u2013PAGE sample buffer. Protein samples were fractionated on\n8% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters,\nusually BA85 from Schleicher & Schuell (Burnette, 1981), using a semi-dry\nblotting apparatus manufactured by Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, Inc. Fil-\nters were blocked, labeled with primary antibodies, and then developed\nwith peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies exactly as previously\ndescribed (Burke et al., 1982).\n \nThe authors are grateful for several gifts of antibodies and would like to ac-\nknowledge the contributions of Drs. Gordon Chan, Tim Yen, Dirk G\u00f6rlich,\nLarry Gerace, and Takeharu Nishimoto. We are also grateful to Dr. Man-\nfred Lohka for valuable discussions. \nThis work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health\nto B. Burke. D.
