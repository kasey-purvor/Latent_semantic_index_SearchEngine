It is strongly urged that the feasibility of measurements of this kind\nbe carefully explored. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2918446\u0004\nFowler\u2013Nordheim \u0001FN\u0002 tunneling1 is electric-field-\ninduced electron tunneling through a roughly triangular\npotential-energy barrier. When the barrier is strong \u0001so the\ntunneling probability is small, say 10% or less\u0002, a low-\ntemperature emission regime \u0001including room temperature\u0002\nexists, called \u201ccold field electron emission\u201d \u0001CFE\u0002.\nA critical step in understanding CFE was the discovery\nof Millikan and Lauritsen2 that experimental current-voltage\n\u0001i-V\u0002 characteristics plotted as \u0003log10\u0001i\u0002 versus 1 \/V\u0004 are good\nstraight lines. This suggested the empirical equation\ni = C exp\u0001\u2212 B\/V\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere B and C are effectively constant.\nFN\u2019s well-known theory1 uses the physical simplification\nthat tunneling takes place from a flat planar surface, through\nan exact triangular \u0001ET\u0002 barrier. This led \u0001after correction3\u0002 to\nthe \u201coriginal FN-type equation,\u201d written here\nJ = a\u0002\u22121F2PF exp\u0001\u2212 b\u00023\/2\/F\u0002 . \u00012\u0002\nThis gives the emission current density J in terms of\nthe local emitter work-function \u0002 and surface field F.\nThe symbols a\u0001\u00051.541 434\u000310\u22126 A eV V\u22122\u0002 and\nb\u0001\u00056.830 890 eV\u22123\/2 V nm\u22121\u0002 denote universal constants,\ncalled the first and second FN constants.4 PF is the tunneling\nprefactor\nPF = 4\u00021\/2KF\n1\/2\/\u0001\u0002 + KF\u0002 , \u00013\u0002\nwhere KF is the Fermi energy. PF is usually of order unity\nand CFE literature often ignores it. Setting PF=1 in Eq. \u00012\u0002\ngives the \u201celementary FN-type equation.\u201d\nWith the further assumptions that F=\u0004V, where \u0004 is a\nconstant, and that emission area A is constant in the relation\ni=AJ, Eq. \u00012\u0002 suggests that empirical CFE i-V characteristics\nshould obey\ni = CV\u0001 exp\u0001\u2212 B\/V\u0002 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere B, C, and \u0001 are constants and \u0001=2. The discrepancy\nbetween forms \u00011\u0002 and \u00014\u0002 was thought unimportant by FN\n\u0001Ref. 1\u0002 because 1920s CFE experiments could not distin-\nguish between them. Due to Eq. \u00012\u0002, it became customary to\nplot CFE results as a \u201cFN plot\u201d \u0003ln\u0001i \/V2\u0002 versus 1 \/V\u0004, on the\ngrounds that this should generate an exact straight line.\nIn 1939, Abbott and Henderson5 argued that the emis-\nsion area A, and the correction factor \u0005F\nSN discussed below,\nmight be functions of field and voltage. So, an experimental\nvalue \u0001=2 was not necessarily expected. They made empiri-\ncal data plots of form \u0003log10\u0001i \/F\u0001\u0002 versus 1 \/F\u0004 for the values\n\u0001=0,2 ,3 ,4. Deviation of the plot from a straight line was\nleast for \u0001=4. This result has no obvious theoretical expla-\nnation and has largely been ignored.\nTaking the tunneling barrier as exactly triangular is\nsimple and mathematically convenient but not physically re-\nalistic. The next simplest approximation includes a classical\nimage potential energy. For a barrier of zero-field height \u0002,\nthe variation in electron energy M with position is then\nM\u0001z\u0002 = \u0002 \u2212 eFz \u2212 e2\/16\u0006\u00070z , \u00015\u0002\nwhere z is distance from the emitter\u2019s electrical surface6 and\n\u00070 is the electric constant. This barrier, introduced by\nSchottky7 and used by Nordheim,8 has been called a\n\u201cSchottky\u2013Nordheim\u201d \u0001SN\u0002 barrier. Its use in CFE theory\ncauses\n4 the appearance, in the exponent of a theoretical FN-\ntype equation, of a physical \u201cbarrier-shape correction factor,\u201d\ndenoted here by \u0005F\nSN\n. Thus, for the SN barrier, physical\ntheory predicts an exponent of form: exp\u0003\u2212\u0005F\nSNb\u00023\/2 \/F\u0004.\nTypically, \u0005F\nSN has value around 0.7 and makes the predicted\ncurrent density higher by a factor of around 100.\nRecent mathematical developments in CFE theory4,9\nhave yielded a good, simple approximate formula for the\ncorrection factor \u0005F\nSN\n, namely,\n\u0005F\nSN \u0006 1 \u2212 F\/F\u0002 + \u00011\/6\u0002\u0001F\/F\u0002\u0002ln\u0001F\/F\u0002\u0002 , \u00016\u0002\nwhere F\u0002 is the physical field necessary to reduce to zero a\nbarrier originally of height \u0002. We cannot directly measure\nF\u0002 but can estimate it using Schottky\u2019s formula:10\nF\u0002= \u00014\u0006\u00070 \/e3\u0002\u00022. Equation \u00016\u0002 outperforms all existing ap-\nproximations of equivalent complexity.4\nInserting Eq. \u00016\u0002 into the exponent of Eq. \u00012\u0002 and also\nmaking the conventional \u0001but usually hidden\u0002 approximation\nPF=1 yieldsa\u0002Electronic mail: r.forbes@ieee.org.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 193105 \u00012008\u0002\n0003-6951\/2008\/92\u000319\u0001\/193105\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics92, 193105-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Since F\tV, Eq. \u00017\u0002\nclearly predicts that, in the empirical equation \u00014\u0002,\n\u0001\u00022. For \u0002=4.5 eV, we have F\u0002=14.0 V \/nm, \b=4.64, and\n\u0001=2\u2212\b \/6=1.2.\nMore generally, there are other theoretical reasons to ex-\npect that \u0001\u00022. \u0001a\u0002 It is obvious from field electron micro-\nscope observations that sometimes the emission area A is a\nfunction of applied voltage. \u0001b\u0002 Jensen11 showed that \u0002\nshould be a weak function of F. \u0001c\u0002 The term F2 in the\npre-exponential of Eq. \u00012\u0002 is obtained by integrating contri-\nbutions from all electronic states associated with a bulk,\nthree-dimensional, free-electron metal. Other materials, in\nparticular carbon nanotubes, may have significantly different\ndistributions of electronic states; so the integration might\nyield a different power of F \u0001and, hence, V\u0002 in the pre-\nexponential.\nThe above suggests fitting experimental data with Eq.\n\u00014\u0002, taking \u0001 as unknown. One could try plotting ln\u0001i \/V\u0001\u0002\nversus 1 \/V. However, this is not a good method when \u0001 is\nunknown and probably nonintegral. In principle, an alterna-\ntive exists. From Eq. \u00014\u0002,\nln\u0001i\u0002 = ln\u0001C\u0002 \u2212 \u0001 ln\u00011\/V\u0002 \u2212 B\/V , \u00018\u0002\n\u2212 d ln\u0001i\u0002\/d\u00011\/V\u0002 = \u0001V + B . \u00019\u0002\nSo, in principle, \u0001 can be obtained from the slope of the plot:\n\u2212d ln\u0001i\u0002 \/d\u00011 \/V\u0002 versus V.\nIf we write F=\u0004V, where \u0004 is constant, and also assume\nemission area A is constant, then the J-F equation equivalent\nto Eq. \u00019\u0002 is\n\u2212 d ln\u0001J\u0002\/d\u00011\/F\u0002 = \u0001F + \u0004B . \u000110\u0002\nThe plotting method based on Eq. \u000110\u0002 was tested on simu-\nlated data sets, for an ET barrier and for a SN barrier. First,\ndata sets of ln\u0001J\u0002 versus 1 \/F were prepared via the com-\nmonly used equations based on these barriers, namely, the\nelementary FN-type equation obtained from Eq. \u00012\u0002 by set-\nting PF=1, and the so-called standard FN-type equation de-\nveloped by Murphy and Good,12 evaluated as described in\nRef. 13. The value \u0002=4.5 eV was used. The values of ln\u0001J\u0002\nwere obtained at equally spaced values of F, from\n3.4 to 10.2 V \/nm. The mth value of \u2212d ln\u0001J\u0002 \/d\u00011 \/F\u0002 was\nobtained as a local average, from the \u0001m\u22121\u0002th and\n\u0001m+1\u0002th values of 1 \/F and ln\u0001J\u0002.\nFigure 1 shows the results of plotting \u2212d ln\u0001J\u0002 \/d\u00011 \/F\u0002\nversus F. For both the ET and SN barriers, the plots are good\nstraight lines. The extracted slope \u0001\u0001\u0002 values are 2.0 for the\nET barrier, as expected, and 1.1 for the SN barrier; this ad-\nequately agrees with the value of 1.2 that was predicted from\nEq. \u00017\u0002. These agreements clearly show that this method\nworks in principle.\nTo test it on experimental results, the data in Fig. 3 of\nRef. 14 were digitized and processed. \u0001These data are a well\ncharacterized set used in 1953 to test the validity of CFE\ntheory.14\u0002 Figure 2 shows that the resulting plot is too noisy\nfor useful conclusions. There seem problems in both the\noriginal data and the digitization. Clearly, this method needs\nraw current-voltage data from careful experiments in low-\nnoise conditions. I cannot find suitable tabulations in CFE\nliterature.\nWith modern computer-controlled equipment, voltage\nsetting and current measurement will be achievable with\ngood accuracy, provided that the electronics has high stabil-\nity and low noise, and the emission itself is stable \u0001which\nrequires good ultrahigh vacuum\u0002. Errors in finding small dif-\nferences in ln\u0001i\u0002 could be a problem. So, the alternative form\nof Eq. \u00019\u0002 may be better,\n\u0001V2\/i\u0002di\/dV = B + \u0001V , \u000111\u0002\nwith di \/dV found by phase-sensitive detection techniques, as\nused \u0001for example\u0002 by Spindt et al.15\nIf accurate measurements are proven possible, then, to\ninterpret results, one needs to establish which physical fac-\ntors are most likely to influence \u0001. For a bulk metal emitter,\nthe voltage-to-local-field conversion factor \u0004 can normally\nbe treated as constant \u0001but this may not be true for nonme-\ntallic emitters\u0002. At present, the exponent correction factor\nand the emission area seem the most influential.\nTwo investigations would clearly be of interest. \u00011\u0002 Ex-\nperiments where the apparent emission area can be measured\naccurately and kept constant as voltage changes.

Here, one\nmight learn if the SN barrier is a good model for the actual\nsurface barrier. \u00012\u0002 From experiments on the total emission\nfrom a tip of known shape, one might learn about the depen-\ndence of emission area on applied voltage.\nAlso of interest are experiments on materials where the\nemitted electrons are not from a bulk metal conduction band.\nThis is because \u0001as noted above\u0002 the integration over elec-\ntronic states may give a different power-law dependence in\nthe pre-exponential. Of particular interest would be experi-\nmental \u0001 values for emission from: \u0001a\u0002 semiconductor sur-\nface states;16 \u0001b\u0002 a Fink-type single-atom electron emitter,17\nand\/or a built-up pyramidal three-atom emitter as used in\nhelium scanning ion microscopy;18 and \u0001c\u0002 open and closed\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes of known configuration and\nradius.\nDetermination of \u0001 values could be an extra experimen-\ntal route to greater understanding of CFE and its variation as\nbetween different materials.
