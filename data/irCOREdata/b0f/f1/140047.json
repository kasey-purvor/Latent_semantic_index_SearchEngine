Accountability of\nmarketers for their marketing spending and contribution to shareholder value creation is\nnow a major issue (e.g. Srivastava, Shervani and Fahey, 1999). In fact, the evaluation of\nmarketing has become a discipline in itself. One area of marketing spending that is\ncoming under scrutiny is spending on brand development. Brands are increasingly\nregarded as company assets and, like tangible assets, require maintenance and\ndevelopment spending. How much investment a brand needs is an issue for marketing\n2and brand managers. We argue that accepted methods of evaluating such spending are\ninadequate, in that they fail to recognise the option value of brand investment, which is\nonly realised when a brand extension is launched. Using a real options framework that\ncaptures the value of brand extensions, we demonstrate that the returns on brand\ninvestment may be understated using traditional methods that primarily focus on the\nimpact of brand marketing on generating incremental sales and ignore extension\npossibilities. This may lead to underinvestment in the brand, which may in turn\nundermine the brand\u2019s asset value.\nA key objective of commercial organisations is the creation of shareholder value, a\nfinancial objective that impacts upon product and brand strategies to such an extent that a\nnumber of commentators have recently suggested that marketing should be measured by\nits contribution to the creation of shareholder value (Doyle, 2000; Srivastava, Shervani\nand Fahey, 1999; Varandarajan and Jayachandran, 1999; Srivastava, Shervani and Fahey,\n1998). The emphasis on measuring marketing effectiveness is part of a wider picture in\nwhich marketing spending has increased as a proportion of overall costs, sometimes\ndramatically (Howell and Soucy, 1990). Increasing costs of advertising and promotion, as\nwell as costly and sometimes high-risk e-commerce projects, have swelled marketing\nbudgets and attracted closer scrutiny at a time when the emphasis on shareholder value\ncreation has made companies focus not just on profits but on the risks as well as the\nreturns of their investment in marketing and other projects.\nAt the same time, and for the same reasons, traditional brand management practices are\ncoming under close scrutiny and their value-adding capabilities are under question (Knox\nand Maklan, 1998; Maklan and Knox, 1997). The practitioner literature suggests that the\neffectiveness of marketing campaigns is in fact often evaluated by estimating the\nincremental sales that are attributable to marketing activities. This is usually done with\neconometric modelling1 and\/or where data permits with regional tests2 (Evelegh and\n1 Econometric modelling is a regression based technique which in this context isolates and quantifies key\ndrivers of sales (eg price, distribution, economic growth, marketing activity, etc). An econometric model\ncan be used to estimate the impact of marketing activity on incremental sales.\n3Dias, 1998; Redhouse and Binet, 1996). These methods focus on short-term returns from\nincremental sales rather than longer-term value creation. Consequently, the financial\nreturns through incremental sales do not always justify the marketing budget.\nIntuitively, practitioners understand that measuring only incremental sales may give a\nmisleading picture of brand marketing effectiveness and other studies have attempted to\nevaluate the manifold effects of marketing, for example by modelling the impact of\nmarketing on distribution and\/or inferring a causal relationship between brand marketing\nand lower price elasticity in addition to the impact on incremental sales (Holgate and\nDeykin, 2000; Cook et al., 1990). Where such modelling has been carried out, the\napparent financial return may be considerably higher than the return generated from\nincremental sales alone.\nStudying the impact of brand marketing on price elasticity and\/or supply chain\ndependencies, however, does not deal with the further contribution that brand marketing\nmakes, which is the potential for line and brand extensions. One could argue that,\nwithout investment in brand building, extension possibilities are limited. One survey of\nleading consumer product companies found that 95% of new product introductions were\nextensions and only 5% were new brands (Aaker, 1991). This particular benefit of brand\nmarketing has been recognised as an indication of marketing effectiveness.\nUnderselling the brand\nWe believe that traditional methods of marketing evaluation that are often employed by\npractitioners and which we have referred to above underestimate the true benefits from\nbrand marketing unless extension opportunities are taken into account. However, putting\na value on brand extension opportunities is not without difficulties. The usual approach\nis to use discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. This involves forecasting the stream of\nfuture profits from each brand extension opportunity and then discounting them back to\nthe present day. The discount rate reflects the degree of uncertainty about the future\n2 Regional tests can be used to analyse differences in sales of a brand between a test region where\nmarketing is employed and a control region where there is no marketing.\n4profit stream: the more uncertain, the higher the discount rate and, hence, the lower the\nnet present value (NPV) of the cash flow. A simplified example of the DCF calculation\nused to value a future brand extension is shown as Table 1.\nTable 1: Valuing a future brand extension using DCF\nYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4\nProfit from brand extension $10m $10m $10m $10m\nDiscount rate 10% 10% 10% 10%\nDiscount factor 0.91 0.83 0.75 0.68\nNet present value (NPV) $9.1m $8.3m $7.5m $6.8m\nNet present value of the\nbrand extension\nopportunity\n$31.7m\nIn this simple example, profits from the brand extension arrive at the end of each year,\nstarting from the end of next year. The brand extension is worth $10m in profits each\nyear for four years, a notional $40m. The discount rate used by the brand owners to\ndiscount future, more uncertain, profits is 10% per year so the apparent present value of\nthe brand extension opportunity is a total of $31.7 million.\nUnfortunately, traditional discounted cash flow analysis may seriously underestimate the\nvalue of flexibility (Luehrman, 1998). For brand managers, flexibility such as the ability\nto increase or decrease brand extension investment depending on future circumstances\nmight be very valuable indeed to enable them to respond to changes in market\ncircumstances. We advocate a methodology based on real options theory because it can\ncapture the value of flexibility. We will demonstrate that real options theory can evaluate\nthe contribution of brand marketing to the success of a brand extension.\nReal Options are a tool from the field of finance and project appraisal that enable\nmanagers to calculate by how much flexibility increases the value of an investment. We\npropose to borrow this tool from finance and apply it to brand marketing. Brand\nmarketing and investment is linked to the concept of brand equity. For context, we\nprovide a brief description of the concept of brand equity and the use and valuation of\n5financial options. We then discuss real options and their application to brand marketing\nand go on to consider some of the managerial implications.\nWhat is Brand Equity?\nMany definitions of \u2018brand equity\u2019 exist. A recent definition of brand equity, for\nexample, suggests that it encompasses three key elements of a brand: consumer\nassociation, brand strength and brand value (Feldwick, 1996). However, it is clear that\nthe term is associated with, but distinguishable from, the valuation of a brand as an asset.\nBrand valuation exercises have often demonstrated that the value of brands as assets can\nbe very substantial indeed (Haigh, 2000; Murphy, 1989). Brand marketing can be a\npowerful tool in creating and enhancing brand equity. Investing in brand equity through,\nfor example, advertising campaigns, sponsorship etc opens up new opportunities for the\nbrand which may include launching brand extensions, increasing a price premium and\nbenefiting from market changes (for example, adapting the brand to changes in trends and\nfashions). The creation of such opportunities has financial value, but it is with regard to\nthe first of these, brand extensions, that we shall concentrate in this paper. Our logic-\nflow is as follows: if marketing enhances brand equity, then we expect that that brand\nequity will be leveraged, particularly in situations where brand extensions are planned.\nIf marketing enhances brand equity and facilitates brand extensions, why is the\njustification of spending on brand equity an issue for marketing managers?\nUnfortunately, when managers come under pressure to improve short-term performance,\nthey sometimes not only stop brand extension activities but also reduce even the basic\nday-to-day marketing activity that serves to maintain the brand. This has the immediate\neffect of enhancing short-term profitability, even though it may undermine the longer-\nterm equity of the brands. We argue that, if long-term brand equity was properly\nunderstood, the true financial impact of brand marketing would be much clearer.\nInvesting in brand maintenance and in brand extensions builds future value. At the very\nleast, on-going brand maintenance serves to keep a company\u2019s options open by keeping\nthe brand alive and healthy. Investment in brand extensions may also offer the company\nflexibility in the future to extend the brand even further into new areas. To put a value on\n6this flexibility, option theory is needed. The application of option theory is explained\nfirst by reference to its origins in financial options and then by the more recent\napplication of the technique to investment in other assets (\u2018real options\u2019).\nFinancial Options\nA financial or securities option is the right to buy or sell an underlying financial asset.\nIn financial markets, options are tools that were originally employed to reduce the risk of\nadverse price movements. Buying an option bestows the right (but not the obligation) to\nbuy or sell a stated property, security, or commodity at a given price within a specified\ntime. Possession of the option protects the holder from the risk that the underlying asset\nchanges in price, before the option holder is ready to buy or sell the underlying asset.\nThere are two main types of financial options \u2013 \u2018calls\u2019 and \u2018puts\u2019. A call option bestows\nthe right to buy a security at a fixed price, whereas a put option bestows the right to sell a\nsecurity at a fixed price. In this paper, we will focus on call options. The following\nhypothetical example will illustrate how a financial call option on a security works:\nToday, shares of Company A are trading at \u00a310. It is possible to purchase a one-year call\noption for \u00a33. The owner of the option has the opportunity to purchase Company A\nshares for \u00a38 (known as the exercise price) within 12 months time. If the buyer of the\noption decides to exercise the option today, the payoff would be \u00a32. However, having\nspent \u00a33 on buying the option, the buyer would be \u00a31 out of pocket; \u00a31 represents the\npremium he or she has paid for the flexibility to wait and exercise the option if and when\nthe stock price increases within a year. The payoff diagram below illustrates the convex\nnature of the option and the value generated from owning it.\nThe net payoff to an investor is the amount by which the share price exceeds the exercise\nprice, less the price paid for the option. If the share price falls below the exercise price,\nthe investor is not obliged to exercise the option and therefore only the price paid for the\n7option is lost. Essentially, the owner of the option limits downside risk, unlike a\nshareholder that bears the entire downside. A shareholder\u2019s payoff line is not convex \u2013 it\nis represented by the dotted line in the diagram.\nINSERT FIGURE 1\nReal Options\nJust as financial options are the right to buy or sell financial assets, real options are the\nright to buy or sell real assets. Real options are particularly valuable in situations in\nwhich investment decisions can be deferred. Deferral has value not just because an\norganisation can earn interest on the capital it retains, but also because deferring a\ndecision until the business situation clarifies reduces the uncertainty surrounding that\ndecision (Buckley and Tse, 1996) and increases flexibility (Flatto, 1998). Where the\ninvestment cannot be deferred, the real option value and the NPV of a projected\ninvestment are identical (Luehrman, 1998). The value of deferral is the interest on the\ncapital saved, plus the risk reduction. Real options can certainly be used to evaluate\nsituations where the investor pays to learn about an uncertain quantity or technology\n(Copeland and Keenan, 1998) and to evaluate R & D (Buckley and Tse, 1996). These are\nall situations that may arise where brand extensions are planned.\nReal investment options are options embedded in real assets - for example the option to\nexpand a project, abandon it, or defer investment. Advocates of real options suggest that\nthe thinking behind financial options can be applied to real assets (Amram and\nKulatilaka, 1999). Whereas financial options are associated with financial instruments,\nreal options are employed when making real-life investment decisions. There is a vast\nbody of literature illustrating and documenting the use of real options in various\nindustries (e.g. Amram and Kulatilaka, 1999; Micalizzi, 1999; Smit, 1997; Smit, 1994;\nPaddock et al., 1988). We will illustrate with a simple example from the oil industry\nbefore moving on to discuss how real options are applicable in marketing.\n8When a petroleum exploration firm searches for oil, a lease is paid on the land where the\nsearch is being conducted. The lease fee is usually paid to the land-holding government.\nOnce oil is found, the firm has primarily three possible options available to it:\n1. Start drilling and production\n2. Sell the lease to another firm (effectively abandon the project)\n3. Postpone drilling, but carry on paying the lease on the land\nThe decision rests on one key factor: the price of oil. If the price of oil is high and is\nabove the minimum price that is required for production to be profitable, the most\nbeneficial option would be to start production. Conversely, if the oil price is low, selling\nthe lease or postponing production become the preferred options.\nThe real options solution in the low price scenario would be to postpone production until\nthe price of oil increases and exceeds the minimum level required for profitable\nproduction. By continuing to pay the lease on the land, the firm is essentially buying a\ncall option. The lease bestows the right to start drilling should the price of oil rise. If the\nprice of oil does not increase, all that is lost is the amount spent on the lease \u2013 a small\nsum in comparison to having started drilling without a subsequent increase in the market\nprice of oil. The cost of the lease is also a small sum relative to the potential gains that\nwould result if the price of oil increased such that production was profitable.\nUsing a real options framework, the firm can price the option of extending the lease \u2013 i.e.\nestimate the maximum fee that should be paid for the right to start production. If the cost\nof the lease exceeds the maximum fee, the project should be abandoned. What usually\nhappens in such a case is that cost of the lease is negotiated down. The government that\nowns the land usually has a team of advisors who employ real options models that can\nestimate the price of the lease. Hence, there can be agreement between government and\noil producing firm with regard to the cost of the lease. The power of real options is that it\noffers a methodology that estimates the price of \u2018staying in the game\u2019 \u2013 in the case of the\n9petroleum producing firm, this is the price paid to have the flexibility to drill when the oil\nprice rises, without the obligation of having to drill should the price of oil not rise.\nINSERT FIGURE 2\nBrand Equity as a Real Option\nThe link between brand marketing and real options is conceptually straightforward. If we\nthink of brand marketing as a vehicle that keeps the brand alive by building on brand\nequity, then by merely staying in the game, any extension opportunities that arise in the\nfuture can be exploited. Leveraging brand equity when exploring NPD avenues is likely\nto increase the likelihood of success of the venture. However, the financial value\nattributable to staying in the game is often overlooked when making marketing\ninvestment decisions. This is illustrated in the following hypothetical example:\nA firm must decide whether to extend one of its brands into a new sector sometime in the\nnear future. For the extension to be successful, the parent brand needs to be supported\nprior to the launch. An important assumption is being made here: the parent brand\nrequires support in order to increase brand equity before the extension is launched. The\nextension will benefit from the increased equity of the parent brand. It is estimated that a\nminimum initial commitment of \u00a36m of brand building advertising is required leading up\nto the launch. From past research on advertising effectiveness that has been conducted\non the parent brand, it is estimated that \u00a36m of parent brand advertising will generate\nearnings that have a net present value of \u00a35m for the parent brand through incremental\nsales. The brand extension will also incur a sunk cost of a plant estimated at \u00a325m.\nFurthermore, the brand extension will require product specific advertising support of \u00a33m\nat the time of launch. If the brand extension is successful, it is forecast to generate\nearnings that have a NPV of \u00a335m. Conversely, an unsuccessful brand extension will\ncreate earnings that have a NPV of \u00a310m. Assume further that success and failure are\nequally likely (probability of success or failure = 0.5). Should the firm extend the brand?\n10\nThe traditional way to approach such a problem is to calculate the expected return from\nthe venture. This is calculated as follows:\nCosts = 6 + 25 + 3 = \u00a334m\n\u00a334 million is the total cost from parent brand advertising, plant building, and extension\nspecific advertising.\nExpected Earnings = (5 +35) x 0.5 + (5 +10) x 0.5 = \u00a327.5m\nThe \u00a35m that appears in both brackets refers to extra earnings from incremental sales\ngenerated from parent brand advertising. The \u00a335m and \u00a310m refer to predicted earnings\nfrom successful and unsuccessful extensions. Each outcome is equally likely and is\ntherefore weighted by 0.5.\nExpected Profit from extension = 27.5 \u2013 34 = -\u00a36.5m\nOn the basis of the above calculation, the firm may decide not to proceed with the brand\nextension since the expected profit is negative. Moreover, the firm may even decide not\nto invest in brand advertising since the cost of advertising exceeds the incremental\nearnings from the parent brand. However, the expected profit calculation ignores the\nvalue of a real option that is present here. The above calculation implicitly assumes that\nthe final decision to proceed or not has to be made now \u2013 i.e. there is no opportunity to\n\u2018wait and see\u2019. The real options solution would be to invest in brand advertising and\ndefer the decision to extend the brand until more information becomes available,\nmaximising the benefit of flexibility. After a period of learning, the firm is in a position\nto go ahead with the brand extension if the likelihood of success is higher. Alternatively,\nthe firm can abandon the whole idea if an unsuccessful extension is forecast \u2013 the only\ncost that would have been incurred is brand building advertising, but this would have\nbeen partially offset by earnings generated from sales of the parent brand. In effect,\ninvesting in the advertising campaign creates a call option \u2013 the right but not the\n11\nobligation to proceed with an extension. The expected return calculation changes with\nthe real options framework. We consider the pessimistic and optimistic cases separately:\nOptimistic Case\nCosts = 6 + 25 + 3 = \u00a334m\nExpected Earnings = 5 +35 = \u00a340m\nProfit from extension = \u00a36m\nPessimistic Case\nIf the pessimistic case is forecast, the extension is not carried through. The plant is not\nbuilt, the extension specific advertising cost is not incurred and income from the\nextension is not realised. All that is lost is the expenditure on parent brand advertising,\nwhich is partially offset by earnings from sales of the parent brand. We are essentially\nlimiting our downside exposure.\nCosts = \u00a36m\nEarnings = \u00a35m\nProfit from extension = -\u00a31m\nThe results from the two scenarios are given equal weights and the expected profit\ncalculated.\nExpected profit (Probability weighted profit) = 6 x 0.5 + -1 x 0.5 = \u00a32.5m\nWhat is happening here is that the investment in parent brand advertising creates an\noption that has value. The gap between the two expected return calculations arises\nbecause of the value of the option. The option can be exercised selectively - do so when\nit is to your advantage, but let it lapse when not. Therefore, we can effectively think of\ninvesting in parent brand advertising as analogous to buying a call option because it\n12\nlimits the firm from the downside exposure of the pessimistic case whilst allowing it to\nbenefit from the optimistic case.\nThe payoff diagram for the hypothetical example is shown below:\nINSERT FIGURE 3\nFaced with an uncertain future, the owner of the brand can benefit from successful\nextension possibilities, whilst being insulated against unsuccessful ones (where the\nextension is not produced). This fundamental \u2018convexity\u2019, as depicted by the thick black\nline in the diagram, is what gives the investment in brand marketing (or the real option)\nfinancial value.\nThe hypothetical example above is something of a simplification of the decision making\nprocess. In reality, a firm may not be able so unambiguously to estimate the earnings and\nprobabilities associated with successful and unsuccessful brand extensions. In fact,\nfuture brand extensions are not usually conceived of when brand investment decisions are\nmade. Nevertheless, building on brand equity gives the brand options for the future even\nif the exact nature of the options is unknown. In a nutshell, investment in brand\nmarketing keeps the option of future possibilities alive by building on brand equity,\nwhich can be leveraged when launching brand extensions.\nSuccessful Brand Extensions and Return on Investment\nIf brand marketing investment creates brand equity and is analogous to buying a call\noption, it could be suggested that launching a brand without prior brand marketing\ninvestment (and hence no brand equity) is analogous to buying a financial asset outright.\nIf so, the payoff from not investing in brand marketing would be as shown by the dotted\nline in the diagram below. The pay-off from investing in prior brand marketing would be\nas shown by the convex curve (thick shaded) line. The value created from the brand\n13\nmarketing option is the vertical distance between the two lines and is shown by the arrow.\nThe vertical distance, or value created, is a (negative) function of earnings from the brand\nextension: as NPV of earnings from extension decreases, value created from the brand\nmarketing option increases (and vice-versa). The relationship is formalised by the\nequation,\nValue Created (\u00a3m) = 28 \u2013 NPV Earnings from Extension, for earnings < \u00a328m\nValue Created (\u00a3m) = 0, for earnings > \u00a328m\nThe value of the option is over and above any manifold effects (price premium,\ndistribution gains etc) benefiting the parent brand as a result of the brand marketing\ninvestment.\nINSERT FIGURE 4\nSummary\nWhere part of the value of an investment is that it provides a greater range of future\noptions (greater flexibility) as well as a future stream of profits and cash flow, traditional\ndiscounted cash flow valuation techniques are known to understate the value of the\ninvestment (Luehrman, 1998). The more uncertain the future, the greater the value of an\noption (Flatto, 1998). Initially, option values were calculated using financial options\n(Scholes, 1997). Options theory was later extended to cover options on investment in\nreal assets (real options).\nWe have applied options thinking to investments in brand equity and brand extensions\nand conclude that managers may underestimate the value of brand investment and brand\nextensions if they use traditional DCF tools to evaluate these strategies. The reason for\nthis (as demonstrated in our example) is because the traditional NPV calculation did not\ncapture the benefit of flexibility - in our example this refers to the flexibility to launch the\n14\nbrand extension if the optimistic scenario is forecast or abandon brand extension plans if\nthe pessimistic case is forecast. Real options offer a way correctly to price the value of\nflexibility which occurs as a result of brand marketing investment.\nIf marketing managers are to evaluate the holistic impact of brand marketing then\nconsideration of brand marketing as a real option is essential, in addition to the other\nbenefits of brand marketing (eg incremental sales uplift, distribution gains, lower price\nelasticity etc). Furthermore, we would argue that, when estimating the contribution of\nbrand marketing to shareholder value, the option value of the brand over and above the\nvalue at current use should be considered.\nThe mathematics of option pricing are not simple (in fact, the pioneers of financial option\npricing theory won a Nobel Prize for their work), but real options are increasingly\ngaining ground as a way of understanding the value of a whole range of investments, not\njust brand marketing ones, and software products that calculate option values are widely\navailable (Winston, 1996).\nManagerial Implications and recommendations\nThe consequences of mispricing brand investments are that companies may underinvest\nin their key assets, their brands, particularly when times are tougher. Reducing brand\ninvestment may allow the company to reach its short-term targets but may undermine its\nability to create value in the longer term. By demonstrating the true value of brand\nmaintenance and brand extension marketing, real options allow marketing managers to\ndefend their brand spending. In a climate where accountability for marketing spending is\nan increasing pressure, real options should be a tool that is used when marketing budgets\nare called to account.\n15\nA second managerial implication is that understanding options may in itself change the\nway that brand managers develop strategies. For example, the more volatile the market,\nthe more valuable the option because downside exposure is limited whilst the option can\nstill benefit from the upside. Managers who understand options thinking will understand\nthat, when times are highly uncertain, the best marketing strategies might be to make\ninvestments that create options, rather than to postpone all investment and possibly lose\nfuture opportunities altogether. Another aspect of options thinking is that options only\nhave a value where there is flexibility in timing. Where there are no opportunities to\nscale investments up or down, the value calculated using DCF and calculated using\noptions is the same (Luehrman, 1998). Brand managers using options thinking might be\nmore appreciative of brand management strategies that build in greater flexibility. More\nflexible strategies might well enable organisations to react faster to both successes and\nfailures. Where the brand manager has built in to his or her strategic plan the option to\nincrease or decrease investment, he or she is more likely to be able to capitalise on a\nrunaway success or scale down an unexpected underperformer.\nThere is also a recommendation for marketing managers about the use of real options,\nwhich is that real options can help managers decide what their marketing budgets should\nbe. In finance, the price paid for a call option is the premium for flexibility \u2013 i.e. the\namount paid to have the right to buy a share at a fixed price if and when the share price\nincreases. Options theory contains a set of tools for the analyst to estimate the price that\nshould be paid for the option. In other words, the value of flexibility can be estimated.\nIn the marketing arena, if the marketing budget is analogous to the option price, in theory\nwe should be able to apply tools developed in options theory to estimate the optimal size\nof a marketing budget. More research would be necessary to determine whether this\nshould be the case.\nAre Options an option?\nMarketers have understood the importance of brand equity for a long time, particularly\nwith regard to launching brand extensions. However, the language of real options has not\n16\nbeen a part of marketing parlance. The benefit of using a real options framework is that it\noffers a methodology to estimate the contribution of brand marketing to the success of a\nbrand extension.\nTraditional evaluation methods concentrate on incremental sales and in some cases the\neffects of marketing on distribution gains and price elasticity are also taken into account.\nHowever, the return on investment from marketing endeavours is greatly increased if\nconsideration of possible future outcomes and the value of flexibility are made. A real\noptions based evaluation methodology would account for convex payoffs as in the\nexample we have used.\nWe have argued that marketing budgets, when they are called to account, should make\nuse of options theory to explain the true value-creating potential of investment in brands.\nMoreover, brand managers might actively explore flexible strategies that allow for\ninvestment in brand extensions to be scaled up or down if they are more aware of the\nvalue of these options.\nThe aim of this paper is to establish a framework of options thinking for brand marketers\nand to make a case that real options offer a promising tool for brand marketers to use in\nevaluating brand strategies. More work is required to evaluate the use of real options in\nmarketing.\nReferences\nAaker, D.
