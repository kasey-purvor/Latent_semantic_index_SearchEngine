Introduction. Due to the recent discovery of high-To superconductors, i.e.,\nmaterials that retain superconducting properties at relative high temperatures, there\nhas been a tremendous resurgence of interest in superconductivity among the physics,\nmaterial science, engineering, and mathematics communities. One of the features\nof high-To superconductors is their layered structure, comprising alternating layers of\nsuperconducting, and non (or weakly) superconducting materials. In planes parallel to\nthe layers, the material is isotropic. However, there is a strong anisotropy present when\none compares material properties parallel and perpendicular to the layers. One may\nconsult [11] for a recent survey providing a lucid discussion of layered superconductors.\n(It should be noted that some of the low-T superconductors also possess a layered\nstructure. One fortunate result of this is that scientists have been studying layered\nsuperconductors for a period of time substantially longer than that that has transpired\nsince the discovery of high-T superconductors.)\nA model proposed by Ginzburg and Landau [9] has become generally accepted as\na macroscopic model for superconductivity in isotropic (and homogeneous) supercon-\nductors, e.g., in atomic metals. However, this model cannot account for the anisotropy\nof layered superconductors. In its place, alternative models have been proposed. One\nof these is the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model or effective mass model introduced\nby Ginzburg in 1952; see [14] and [20] and the references cited therein. In this model,\nthe effects of the microscopic layered structure are averaged out so that the anisotropic\n*Received by the editors October 13, 1993; accepted for publication (in revised form) February\n2, 1994.\nMathematical Institute, 24-29 St. Giles\u2019, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3LB, United\nKingdom.\n:Department of Mathematics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824.

The model itself is only a slight variant of the Ginzburg-Landau model.\nAnother model for layered superconductors is the Lawerence-Doniach model intro-\nduced in [17]; see also [4] and [15]. In this model, the material is treated as a stack\nof superconducting planes, each pair of which is separated by a vacuum or insulat-\ning material. Furthermore, in this model, the coupling between the superconducting\nplanes is similar to that that occurs in a Josephson junction. Again, one may consult\n[11] and the references cited therein for a complete discussion of these models and\nthe physical circumstances necesssary for their validity. (Other models have also been\nproposed, e.g., the anisotropic London model, which we do not consider here.)\nOur goal here is to examine some mathematical properties of the two models\nfor layered superconductors and in particular to rigorously establish the connection\nbetween the two models as the spacing between the layers tends to zero. We also\nexamine some simplications that can be effected in the models in the case of high-\nTc superconductors. These simplifications are of importance since they can result,\nfor example, in substantial savings in the cost of computer simulations of physical\nphenomena.\nIn the remainder of this section, we introduce some notation that will be used in\nthe sequel. In 2 we briefly consider the isotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model, to\nestablish some terminology which will be used later. In 3 we consider the anisotropic\nGinzburg-Landau, or effective mass (EM), model and provide some results concerning\nthe model. We do likewise for the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model in 4. In 5 and\n6 we, respectively, make the rigorous connection between the two models and discuss\nthe simplications that may be effected in the high-To case, both of which were alluded\nto above.\n1.1. Notation. Throughout, we will denote three-vectors by (7) and two-vectors\nby bold face notation. Thus, A, A, and A denote a scalar, a two-vector, and a three-\nvector, respectively. We will often have occasion to partition a three-vector A into the\nform\nso that here Az denotes the third component of A. The same notational convention\nwill be used for operators. For example, we will denote the gradient operator with\nrespect to the x and y coordinates by grad while the three-component gradient will\nbe denoted by grad.\nThroughout, for any nonnegative integer k and domain 79 C IR3, Hk(79) will\ndenote the Sobolev space of real-valued functions having square integrable derivatives\nof order up to k. The corresponding spaces of complex-valued functions will be denoted\nby 7-\/k(79). Corresponding spaces of three-vector-valued functions, each of whose three\ncomponents belong to Hk(79), will be denoted by \/(79), i.e., k(79) [Hk()]3.\nNorms of functions belonging to g(), H(), and k() will all be denoted,\nwithout any possible ambiguity, by II. I. We use H(N3) to denote the completion of\nC(Na) under the norm\n3\nFor details concerning these spaces, one may consult [2].\nWhen D corresponds to a layered material sample, we will assume that the layers\nare perpendicular to the z-axis and that D x [0, S], where C N is a planar\n158 s.

IRa\/7?. The\ninterface between 77 and 7?e will be denoted by 07?.\nWe will make use of the subspaces\nQ.n-0onFx[0, S], Qz-Oon(ftx{O})U(ftx{S})}\n\/(div IRa) { ( E\/1(iRa) div Q 0 in IRa }.\n2. The isotropic Ginzburg-Landau model. For isotropic and homogeneous\nsuperconducting materials, Ginzburg and Landau postulated [9] that the Qlibbs free\nenergy is given by\n(2.1)\n+--1 ]h HI de \/ Ih HI de.\nHere, is the (complex-valued) order parameter, A is the magnetic potential, h\ncurl A is the magnetic field, c and are constants (with respect to the space variable\n) whose values depend on the temperature, c is the speed of light, es and rns are the\ncharge and mass, respectively, of the superconducting charge-carriers, 27rh is Planck\u2019s\nconstant, and H is the applied field, which throughout this paper is assumed to be a\nconstant vector. (Actually, ac is the difference between the free energy and the free\nenergy due to the applied field H in the normal state. It is important to employ this\nenergy difference since it is a finite quantity even on unbounded domains.) The basic\npostulate of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity is that the Gibbs free\nenergy (2.1) is minimized.\nThe coefficient c changes sign at the critical temperature To, with c < 0 for\nT < To. If the temperature of the sample is lower than To, the sample is in the super-\nconducting state; if T > T, then the sample is in the normal, i.e., nonsuperconducting,\nstate.\nThere are two important length scales associated with changes in the order pa-\nrameter and the magnetic field. These are the coherence length\n1\/2\nand the penetration depth\nZrnc:)(2.3) 47rce 1\/2\nwhich measure distances over which the order parameter and the magnetic field, re-\nspectively, undergo appreciable change. The nondimensional ratio \/ is known\nLAWRENCE--DONIACH AND ANISOTROPIC GINZBURG--LANDAU MODELS 159\nas the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. One should especially note the dependence of\nand A on ms.\nOne may consult, e.g., [1], [6]-[8], [16], [18], [19], or [21] for details about the\nmaterial of this section.\n3. The anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau, or effective mass, model. An an-\nisotropic form of the functional (2.1) may be obtained by replacing the scalar mass\nrn8 by a mass tensor M8 so that the anisotropic Gibbs free energy difference is now\ngiven by\nWe assume that the coordinate axes are aligned with the principal directions of M8\nso that\n(3.2) M\nrex 0 0 )0 my 00 0 rnz\nFurthermore, we assume that planes parallel to the z-axis are isotropic so that mx\nrnv rnll # rnz rn+\/-. (For layered high-temperature superconductors, rn+\/- > rnll in\nsome cases by a large margin.) As a result, we may define two coherence lengths and\ntwo penetration depths, i.e.,\nand +\/-11 2roll a 2m+\/-a\n1\/2\nand\n( \/T\/\" C2 ) 1\/2 ( \/T\/+\/- C2 ) 1\/2All 47rae2 and A 4ae\nFor the layered superconductors described in 1, the anisotropic Gibbs free energy\n(3.1) is valid if the z-axis coherence length z is large compared to the layer spacing.\nAlthough, for high temperature superconductors, this is usually true only near the\ncritical temperature T, it turns out that many (but not all) properties of layered\nsuperconductors can be reasonably simulated using (3.1) and (3.2). Again, see [11]\nand the references cited therein.\nWe now introduce the usual nondimensionalizations. Lengths are nondimension-\nalized by $11, magnetic fields by Hc, where H 4a2\/, the magnetic potential\nby allH, the order parameter by @-a\/, free energy densities by a2\/, and the\nGibbs free energy by a2X\/. Denoting the nondimensionalized variables by the same\nsymbols used for the corresponding dimensional ones, we have that the nondimensional\nGibbs free energy is given by\n(3.3) + f0s\/a ( (grad + A)\n+[curiA-HI2 dxdz\n2 1 (0)+ -5-; + dz dxdz\n+ curl A HI2 d2,\n160 S.

GUNZBURGER\nwhere\nand rn+\/- =(k+\/-) u ({\")\nNote that in (3.3) we have made use of the notation introduced in 1.1 and that we\nhave added an unimportant constant to the free energy in order to write it as a sum\nof squares.\nMany of the results of, e.g., [6] and [8], concerning the isotropic Ginzburg-Landau\nmodel hold for the anisotropic model based on the minimization of (3.3). For example,\none may obtain the following result using the same techniques as those employed in\nTHEOREM 3.1. EM has a least one minimizer belonging to x(Ft x [0, S]) x\nH(IRa). Moreover,\nmin EM min {EM\n,(ax [o,s]) x(a) n,(x [o,s])x\/1 (div ;a)\nOne may also easily deduce the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau equations that result\nfrom the minimization of the functional (3.3).

The Lawrence-Doniach model for layered superconductors. If +\/- is\nless than the layer spacing, then it is necessary to account, in some way, for the\ndiscrete nature of the layered structure. In [17], Lawrence and Doniach proposed such\na model. The layered superconductor is modeled as a stack of infinitely thin, planar\nsuperconducting layers separated by a vacuum or insulating material. Moreover, there\nis a Josephson coupling between the superconducting layers.\nLAWRENCE-DONIACH AND ANISOTROPIC GINZBURG-LANDAU MODELS 161\nThe layers are again assumed perpendicular to the z-axis, and the z-thickness of\nmaterial sample t x [0, S] is again denoted by S. There are N + 1 superconducting\nplanes, each having projection on the (z, y)-plane, and each separated from its\nneighbors by a distance s; thus, Ns S. We again adopt the notation of 1.1 with\nregards to scalars and two- and three-vectors.\n4.1. The Lawrence-Doniach functional. The Lawrence-Doniach functional,\nwhich in the form below was first given in [15], is defined by\n(4.1)\nLD(20, 21, )N, A)\n\/I ( i\u2019s\/\u2019(\u2019N1)s )+s +lexp\n-\nAzdz\n-\nnO\n+\n=o\nIcurl A HI dz dx.\nesAn Iihgrad + nC\ndx\ndx\nHere, A A(x, y,z) (A, Az)T denotes the three-dimensional vector potential, Az\nis its component in z direction, and An An(x, y) A(x, y, ns), n 0, 1,..., N, is\nthe restriction of A to the nth superconducting plane.\nThe order parameter Cn Cn(x, y) is only defined on the nth plane. However, it\nwill be convenient to also view the order parameter as the restriction, to the nth\nplane, of a continuous function of z. Specifically, let T denote the uniform partition\nof the interval [0, S] into N subintervals of length s. We then let Cs(x, y, z) denote a\npiecewise linear function of z, with respect to T, such that 2s(x,y, ns) (x,y).\nWe want to again emphasize that the extension of the order parameter to the layers\nbetween the superconducting planes is a matter of convenience and that, strictly\nspeaking, the order parameter makes sense only on the superconducting planes.\nThe parameter appearing in (4.1) will be specified later; note that has the\nsame dimension as c. We naturally associate the mass rn in (4.1) with rnll of 3.\nUsing similar nondimensionalizations as were used in 3, we arrive at the following\nnondimensional form of the Lawrence-Doniach free energy:\n(4.2)\ndx\nwhere cr\n-\/a. We have again added an unimportant constant to the free energy\nin order to write it as a sum of squares.\nAfter defining the space\n\u2019lsl( X [0, S]) { 2s e-ll(a x [0, S]) \/)s is a piecewise\nlinear function of z with respect to T },\n162 s.J. CHAPMAN, Q. DU, AND M. D. GUNZBURGER\nwe have that s and A are determined as solutions of the minimization problem\nmin\n(,X) ( [o, s]) q(3) }LD(S, A)\nNote that if E \/(IR3), then, by the trace theorem, An E H1\/(ft). Also,\n?-tl(f x [0, S]) implies 0n E 7-tl(ft). Therefore, it follows from standard Sobolev\nimbedding results that the functional GLD is well defined on 7-\/l(ft x [0, S]) x\/-(IR3).\nSee, e.g., [2], for details.\n4.2. Gauge invariance and the existence of minimizers. As is the case\nfor the functionals (2.1) and (3.1), the Lawrence-Doniach functional (4.2) is invariant\nunder a certain gauge transformation. For any smooth function g, let the linear\ntransformation G9 be defined by\nGg(s,A)-(,Q)\nn(x, y) Cn(x, y)exp (ing(x, y, ns)) and (gradg)Q- A+ oOz\nNote that if ((, Q)- Gg(O,A), then (p, A)- G_g((, Q).\nDEFINITION. (b,) and (s, () are said to be gauge equivalent if and only if\nthere exists a g H2(]R3) such that (, Q) Gg(b, A).\nAgain, as is the case for the previous models, a possible choice of gauge for the\nLawrence-Doniach model is given by div A 0 in lR3 and A. g 0 on the boundary\n0 of [0, S]. We then have the following result.\nLEMMA 4.1. Any (,Q) e }( x [0, S])x (3) is gauge equivalent to an\nelement of(a x [0, S]) x (div ;3).\nThe next result follows from the obvious relation\nLD(.2 A) LD(Gg(2s, A))\nPROPOSITION 4.2. For any g H2(]R3), LD is invariant under the gauge trans-\nformation Gg\nUsing a standard variational argument, we then may obtain the following exis-\ntence result.\nLEMMA 4.3. The functional LD defined in (4.2) has a least one minimizer be-\nlonging to 7-t( x [0, S]) x n(div JR3).\nThis lemma, along with Lemma 4.1 and Proposition 4.2, yield the following result.\nTHEOREM 4.4.

The Lawrence-Doniach equations. Using standard techniques from the\ncalculus of variations, we may deduce the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding\nLAWRENCE--DONIACH AND ANISOTROPIC GINZBURG--LANDAU MODELS 163\nto the minimization of the Lawrence-Doniach functional (4.2).\nLawrence-Doniach equations which are given by\nThe result is the\n)n + )n 2)n -t-\" grad -+- An )n\n+ G [2n )n+l exp(--iCr+1) @n--1 exp(i(nn_l)] 0\nin ft and for n 0, 1,...,N,\nwhere\n(4.4)\n(n+l)s)+1 Az dzI\u2019,\nn8\nfor n 0,...,N- 1,\nand\n(4.5) curl curlA- jz in ]R3\nwhere\n(4.6)\nN ( (ngradCn*- Cn*gradCn)- ]nl2An) ((z\nn=-O\nin ]R3\n(4.7) jz itG8 [n exp(iOnn+l)r+l exp(--i(+l)n+l]\nin ft x [us, (n + 1)s], n- 0,...,X- 1,\nand\n(4.8) jz -O inT?-lR3\/D\nOne also obtains the boundary conditions\n(4.9) (igradb+Ann)n-O-n on F and for n 0, 1,...,N,\n(4.10) [xff]--O and [curl\/Txff] =0 on the boundaryOT}offtx [O,S],\nand\n(4.11) curlA-- H as\nIf we choose the London gauge, then also\ndiv A 0 in ]R3\nA-n-0 onrx[O,S], and Az-O on(ftx{O})U(ftx{1}).\n164 S.

However, the two most important features of\nthe system (4.3)-(4.11) were first given in [17]. These are the discrete nature of the\norder parameter as a function of z, and, foremost, the Josephson coupling between\nthe superconducting planes.\n4.4. Bound on the order parameter. In the current nondimensionalization,\nICnl 1 corresponds to the superconducting state. Thus, we naturally expect that\nIs[ _< 1. everywhere in the superconducting sample.\nPROPOSITION 4.5. If (h, A) is a continuous solution of the Lawrence-Doniach\nequations (4.3)-(4.11), then I1 <_ 1 in t x [0, S].\nProof. Note that for any fixed x and y,\n1 (, , )1 -< mx{\nfor z E Ins, (n + 1)s], n 0, 1,...,N- 1,\nso that we may assume that the maximum value of [1 is achieved by Ik(zk, Yk)l for\nsome integer k between 0 and N and for some point (xk, y) E . We now apply a\ntechnique introduced in [12]. If [k(x, Y)I >-\/ > 1, using a gauge transformation, we\nmay assume, without loss of generality, that in a neighbood of (xk, y), the solution\nis real valued, positive, and greater than unity. In this case, the real part of equation\n(4.3) is given, near (x, Yk), by\n(l)k 12 1)+(-a-2ACk) +or [2 N{k+ exp(--\"(k+lk Ck- exp(t(C)k_1\"k )}] 0.\nSince k(xk, Yk) > > 1, the first term on the left-hand side is positive and bounded\naway from zero in a sufficiently small neighborhood of (xk, yk). Since has a maxi-\nmum at (Xk, Yk), the second term is nonnegative, perhaps in a smaller neighborhood.\nFinally, in perhaps an even smaller neighborhood, the third term is larger than an neg-\native number of arbitrarily small magnitude. Therefore, the left-hand side is positive.\nThis contradiction implies\n5. The relation between the Lawrence-Doniach and anisotropic Ginz-\nburg-Landau models. It is commonly accepted that if the layer thickness s is very\nsmall, then the Lawrence-Doniach model reduces to the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau\nmodel. Here, we give a rigorous demonstration of this fact.\nThe various nondimensional parameters appearing in the two models are to be\nrelated by\n(5.1) \/crs2 -2.\nSubstituting their dimensional counterparts, i.e., a -\/c, 1111, 7--m+\/-\/mll,\nand s --+ s\/ll we have that\n82\nwhere now all parameters, including s are dimensional. Below, we relate the nondimen-\nsional forms of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau and Lawrence-Doniach free energies\nLAWRENCE-DONIACH AND ANISOTROPIC GINZBURG--LANDAU MODELS 165\nby letting the nondimensional layer spacing s tend to zero. If we were to examine\nthis relation in the dimensional setting, it can be seen from (5.2) that one must let\nthe dimensional spacing s tend to zero relative to the perpendicular coherence length\nGiven the uniform partition of step length s of the interval [0, S] in the z-axis,\nwe let I denote the piecewise linear interpolation operator in z with respect to the\npartition.\nThe main result that relates the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model to the\nLawrence-Doniach model is given in the following theorem.\nTHEOREM 5.1. Let the functionals EM and CD be defined by (3.3) and (4.2),\nrespectively, which are in nondirnensional form. Let the parameters appearing in\n(3.3) and (4.2) be related by (5.1). For given s > O, let (,A0) be a minimizer\nof LD(S,) in 7-\/l(ft x [0, S]) x\/-nl(div JR3). Then, as s\n--\nO, {(,0)} forms a\nminimizing sequence of GEM and thus converges to some minimizer of GEM.\nWe shall divide the proof into several lemmas. The first three are easy to verify.\nLEMMA 5.2. Let (s,.) e 7-[sl(a [0, S])\/l(div;IRa). If {CD(S,\/)} is\nuniformly bounded as s O, then { (s, A) } is uniformly bounded in 7-\/l(ft x [0, S])x\nl(div lRa).\nLEMMA 5.3. Let (s,2) E -{sl(a [0, S]) x\/l(div;lR3). \/f {{EM(S,X)} is\nuniformly bounded as s --, 0, then {(s,\/)} is uniformly bounded in 7-\/l(ft x [0, S])x\nn(div ]Ra).\nLEMMA 5.4.

The above proof may be modified to prove Lemma 5.5 without assuming\nthe pointwise bound (5.3) on the magnitude of the order parameter.\n6. Simplified models valid for large and fields of O(a). We now turn to\nsimplifications that can be effected on the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau and\nLawerence-Doniach models in the case of large values of a and applied fields of O(a).\nBoth of these ranges are of interest since it is known that a > 50 for high-temperature\nsuperconductors and since large applied fields are of technological interest. Note that\nthe applied field being O(a) does not necessarily mean that it is close to the upper\ncritical field He2 (which is equal to a for a bulk isotropic superconductor) since IHI\nmay be, for example, \/2. It does mean that however that IHI >> He1, the lower\ncritical field, which is O((1\/t)log ).\nThe analogous simplifications for the isotropic, homogeneous Ginzburg-Landau\nmodel were discussed in detail in [5]. Since most of that discussion applies to the\ncurrent cases, here we will not provide details concerning the derivation or justifica-\ntion of the simplified models. We also note that, in practice, 5 is a sufficiently\n\"large\" value of for the simplified models to yield accurate approximations of the\ncorresponding full models; see [5] for details.\n6.1. The simplified anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model. In the high\nhigh field regime, it is more convenient to nondimesionalize lengths by 11\" We now\nnondimensionalize magnetic fields by x\/H, the magnetic potential by xllH, the\norder parameter by v\/-a\/\/3, free energy densities by a2\/\/3, free energies by a2\/\/3,\nand currents by cH\/(Trll,).

We let A0 be a magnetic potential such that curl Ao Ho. For example,\nif H0 is aligned with the z-axis, i.e., Ho (0,0, Ho) for some constant Ho, Ao\nHo(0, x, 0) satisfies cul A =\/o. Then, using the techniques of [5], it can be shown\nthat there exists a solution (p, A) of the anisotropic Ginburg-Landau equations (6.1)-\n(6.8) satisfying\n(6.9) (Xo)A= +0(-2) and =o+0(-),\nwhere o satisfies\n(6.10)\n(\/grad +Ao)220+- +Aoz in 7)- ftx [0, S],\n(6.11) (\/gradbo+Aoo).n=0 onrx [0, S],\nand\n(o(6.12) i--z + Aoz o 0 on (a (a {S}),\nwhere, of course, Ao (Ao, Aoz).\nCertainly, for n > 50, we see from (6.9) that hA0 and P0 are accurate approx-\nimations to solutions of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau equations (6.1)-(6.8). Of\ncourse, the determination of Ao is trivial for the constant applied field H nHo. The\ndetermination of Po is also greatly simplified since Ao is known in (6.10)-(6.12).\nOf course, it is easy to continue with this asymptotic expansion to find the cor-\nrections to this leading order behavior (see [5]).\nLAWRENCE--DONIACH AND ANISOTROPIC GINZBURG--LANDAU MODELS 171\nIn addition to the fact that, to leading order, the determination of the magnetic\npotential and order parameter are essentially uncoupled, there is another simplifica-\ntion that occurs in the high , high field regime. Following [13], (see also [31, [10], and\n[14]) we note that we can rescale certain variables so that the leading order anisotropic\nequations (6.10)-(6.12) reduce to corresponding isotropic equations. (The full equa-\ntions (6.1)-(6.8) cannot be rescaled with such an effect.) Specifically, let Zv\/,\nflOz Aoz\/x\/-, and 7} ftx [0, ], where\n-\nSv\/-. We do not scale x, y, A0, or\nft. However, the applied field (H, Hz)is rescaled to (I:t, Hz), where I:I- H\/x\/;\nthe z-component is not scaled. With these changes of scale, (6.10)-(6.12) becomes\n(0(6.13) (\/grad + Ao)\n(6.14)\nand\n(6.15)\n(\/grado+Aoo).n-0 onFx [0,],\n(ob-\/ + Aoz o -0 on (a x {0})U (ftx {S}).\nClearly, (6.13)-(6.15) are isotropic equations.\nReversing the scaling process, the above reduction to the isotropic case may be\ninterpreted as follows. Suppose one has in hand a solution\n(x, y, 2) and (A, flz) (x, y, 2)\nof the homogeneous, isotropic Ginzburg-Landau equations for a domain ftx [0, 5] and\nfor an applied field (H, Hz) and suppose the value of is \"large,\" e.g., > 5, and\nthat the applied field is of O(). (There are, for example, numerous codes in existence\nthat yield such results.) Then, for any mass ratio\n(x,y, z) and (A, Az)(x,y, z),\nwhere z 2\/x\/- and Az zv, is an accurate approximation to the solution of the\nanisotropic Ginzburg-Landau equations for the domain ftx [0, S] and for the applied\nfield (H, Hz), where S- \/v and H I:Ix\/. Thus, a single isotropic calculation\ncan be rescaled to yield, at negligible cost, solutions for a one parameter family of\nsolutions of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau equations.\nOne refinement of these observations is that if the applied field is parallel to the\nz-axis, then a change in the mass ratio by a \/factor of K is equivalent to a change in\nthe thickness of the superconducting sample by a factor of V\/1\/K. If the applied field\nis not parallel to the z-axis, then the the tangent of the angle that the field makes\nwith that axis also changes by a factor of x\/.\n6.2.

Clearly, this is a great simplification over the full\nLawrence-Doniach equations (6.16)-(6.24). It is worth noting that, except for the\ngauge invariant form of the z-difference in (6.26), the original model proposed by\nLawrence and Doniach in [17] is given by exactly (6.26) and (6.28).\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
