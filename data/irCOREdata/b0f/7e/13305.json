Introduction An audit of current policy and practice was carried out for Children\u2019s Hospices across London to  identify  good  practice  and  consider  where  there  were  opportunities  for  sharing  and avoiding duplication of effort and resources. The  information  described  here  on  current  practice  was  gathered  at  meetings  of  the Children\u2019s Hospices across London Education Group and from visits to six of the seven CHaL group of hospices plus Little Havens Children\u2019s Hospice in Essex between November 2010 and March 2011.  Informants to the research were principally the education leads in each hospice, sometimes this was clinical staff, sometimes non-clinical staff, and sometimes both. Other staff contributed as available and as the education lead felt appropriate.  The study coincided with the merger between Shooting Star and CHASE hospices, and due to changes in personnel and vacant posts, CHASE Hospice staff did not contribute directly. At each visit, education leads and other staff were asked a set of questions on how they organised  and  ran  training,  whether  they  had  a  training  strategy,  if they  had  identified mandatory training needs, and how they assessed and appraised staff.  They were also asked about clinical skills, how hospices had identified what clinical competencies care staff should have, and their appropriate education.  Finally they were asked for general views, on good  practice  or  examples  of  helpful  tools  and  frameworks  to  support  and  staff development, and the threats to doing this well. Types and sizes hospice The children\u2019s hospices belonging to the London group visited plus Little Havens provided a range of services.  Most provided day and inpatient services for children within the hospice buildings, whereas EllenorLions and Noah\u2019s Ark ran services supporting children in their own homes.  Some children\u2019s hospices operated as separate entities, while others had some shared  services  or  premises  with  partner  hospices  (both  Little  Havens  and  EllenorLions worked closely with a nearby adult hospice, and Demelza ran two distant sites for children one providing hospice and the other community services). As a result there was wide variation between the hospices in the number of staff requiring training, in the size of the infrastructure organising it, and the space available to hold inhouse training sessions.  Training strategies for these hospices will need to accommodate around  50-90  paid  staff  in  a  hospice,  or  20-30  paid  staff  where  support  is  provided  in 80 children\u2019s  homes.    In  addition,  each  hospice  has  up  to  a  dozen  trustees  who  may  be expected to take part in some of the training.  (Hospices also have substantial numbers of volunteers  and  people  involved  in  trading,  but  their  training  needs  have  so  far  been considered outside the scope of this work.) Hospices did not all have sufficient space to accommodate the training sessions they needed to run.  The CHaL group did not seem to share training courses or expenses.  Some felt that the distance to travel was a deterrent to sharing, and some saw in-house training as an opportunity to reinforce organisational vision and values and strengthen the way staff work together.  Apart from these points there was no over-riding reason for not working together more, and some suggested that training of new starters could be run across the London children\u2019s hospices. Staff responsible for training The pattern of responsibility for training clinical and non-clinical staff and topics was not consistent across hospices in terms of who took the lead and the amount of time available for education leads. The contacts for this project tended to be a member of the clinical staff (for example a Practice Facilitator or Clinical Lead) who had responsibility for training in clinical skills.  It was  sometimes  the  case,  especially  for  larger  hospices,  that  there  was  also  a  Human Resources lead person with responsibility for training in non-clinical subject areas.  These arrangements led to a reasonably clear division of responsibility, but of course required the staff  to  collaborate  in  the  planning  and  organisation  of  training  programmes,  such  as induction or annual training run during a shut-down period.  In some hospices, responsibility for training fell mostly on one person, for example where a member of the clinical staff organised the whole range of training for all staff, or conversely a non-clinical lead took responsibility across all subjects and all staff for training. The amount of time available for staff training varied enormously, from having a team of staff  with  dedicated  time  and  facilities  for  training,  to  one  or  two  staff  combining responsibilities for training with delivering and supervising care.  To some extent, staffing levels for training and development would be expected to vary given the differences in the size of hospices and the nature of services they provide, but there is still a need for clear lines of responsibility, that adequately cover both clinical and non-clinical training topics. Education policies or strategies Not all hospices had a written strategy for education and training.  When they did these varied in scope and detail, and were in various stages of being drafted, completed or in need 81 of revision.  The documents covered both the process of and the main subjects for training. For example, they might describe the training and development ethos of the organisation, the processes for staff appraisal and skills assessment, set out expected career progression, describe how training budgets are set, and how attendance is requested and approved. Regarding  topics  for  training  and  course  content,  policy  documents  might  describe  the induction  programme,  identify  mandatory  training  needs,  core  skills  and  clinical competencies, and indicate training topics applying to different categories of staff. Some strategy and policy documents specified quality standards for training, for example in the skills they required in trainers, in making appropriate use of a variety of formats in which training material is delivered, and in measuring the impact of training.  One strategy document incorporated a detailed action plan for the next two years. Mandatory training and other training topics Hospices  consistently  referred  to  a  list  of  topics  where  they  were  expected  to  provide training  to  their  staff,  and  they  usually  delivered  these  at  annual  in-house  training programmes and induction courses.  While hospices were clear that they must train their staff to meet a variety of legal and professional standards, when it came to identifying exactly what these are it represented a large amount of work for each hospice to do it for itself.  The list of mandatory training included fire, food preparation, basic life support and infection control. Staff training must cover the standards laid down by the Health & Safety Executive (HSE), by Health & Social Care legislation and standards set by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).  In addition  some  training  is  required  by  NHS  commissioners  or  decided  by  the  hospices themselves.  The difficulties hospices have are that the standards are not always clearly stated and that they can change over time.  Hospices have realised that it is not necessary to train all staff in all subjects, for example not everyone needs the same level of training and frequency of re-training that a fire marshal receives.  Therefore there is some discretion to be exercised in which staff groups require training, and at what level and how often it needs to be repeated. CQC requirements had changed significantly over recent years, and had become less clear and  prescriptive.    Hospices  are  currently  being  inspected  by  the  CQC  against  the  same standards  as  independent  hospitals  and  nursing  homes,  and  recent  experience  with inspection had not helped clarify what was required of them. Some  hospices  used  spreadsheets  to  list  the  training  that  was  required,  sometimes elaborating these to say who dictated these standards, for which groups of staff, at what level and at what frequency the training should be provided.  The most comprehensive work 82 on this had been done at Little Havens, and to some extent this had been shared.  A section from one of the spreadsheets is given below to illustrate the detail being recorded.

Organisation of training Hospices were running their own training, some of which was provided in-house.  They had built  up  regular  or  reciprocal  arrangements  with  external  providers,  which  were  mainly 83 private  sector  organisations,  but  also  included  hospitals  and  universities.    Mandatory training was often bundled  into sessions over a day or longer, for example  annual and induction sessions might run over a week or two.  Several hospices ran these during an annual shut-down period.  Induction courses were run as frequently as possible, but for some hospices this was only once a year. Hospices  were  at  different  stages  in  the  development  of  databases  for  recording  staff training.    Some  felt  strongly  that  it  was  good  practice  for  records  to  be  kept  and  held centrally for all staff training, showing dates of training, if passed\/failed, and when repeat training was due.  There were some problems when records were not shared or when they were held centrally, such as issues of ownership and accessibility. Styles of learning and development The most usual form of training was instructor-led and delivered to groups.  Interactive sessions were generally preferred especially for initial learning.  On-line\/CD\/DVD courses were  not  used  a  great  deal  by  this  group  of  hospices,  although  it  was  used  for  repeat training, and there was the feeling that these methods would and should be used more. A whole range of ways of learning were used for clinical staff and clinical competencies, such as mentoring, supervision and observation.  Clinical staff were also much more likely to undertake self-directed learning followed by assessment. Much of the learning was done in-house, but staff also attended courses run elsewhere. Hospices  wanted  training  to  be  delivered  to  a  consistent  standard,  and  stressed  the importance of training the trainer: having done the training was not sufficient to be able to pass the knowledge on, and trainers should be trained to teach and assess. Competencies and assessment We asked how the London Children\u2019s Hospices defined and measured staff competencies. Hospices tended  to go  to trusted  organisations, and most mentioned the  Coventry  and Warwickshire Children and Young  People\u2019s Teaching Framework.  Some  also mentioned Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), Children\u2019s Hospice UK (CHUK), the NHS Knowledge and Skills Framework (KSF) and the Association for Children\u2019s Palliative Care (ACT) as being sources of guidelines, competencies and training material. It was quite often the case that existing measures and standards were not found very useful, for  example  the  Coventry  and  Warwickshire  framework  was  described  as  being cumbersome  to  use,  and  other  competencies  not  catering  for  the  specialised  work  of children and young people\u2019s palliative care. 84 As the London Hospices did not generally find existing competencies suited them well, they had  gone  their  own  ways  in  terms  of  how  they  described,  taught  and  assessed  staff competencies.  A few had written their own versions of competencies and were happy to share these.  Some had also written supporting training and assessment material, such as workbooks and proforma for keeping training records, but found this was an extremely time-consuming job. Staff appraisals Hospices were quite similar in having appraisal processes in place.  All hospices had annual staff appraisals and these fed into identifying and planning staff training needs.  However the success of the processes varied and some said that assessing staff competencies was difficult to do.  All hospices had budgets allocated for staff training. Linked to the appraisal process was the issue of maintaining training databases and ensuring staff were up to date and safe to practice, and using databases to plan future training needs. Culture of learning There  was  some  discussion  on  how  a  learning  session  helps  to  build  teams  and  the organisational culture.  Generally in-house courses and those involving a mix of staff groups were seen as enabling this, and some training had to be tailored to the individual hospice setting and could not be run across organisations.  There was another view that running inhouse course might undermine the consistency with which training is delivered, and that there were benefits to learning with people from different institutions. Hospices varied in how well the culture of learning was adopted by all staff.  Some believed there  was  a  poor  training  culture  among  managers,  or  an  organisational  reluctance  to change.  Some hospices were trying to instigate good practice, such as all staff having to undergo training whatever their seniority, and having systematic evaluation of training and assessment  of  the  subsequent  impact  on  individual  staff  performance.    Hospices  were generally keen to follow evidence based practice, both in terms of the care given and the kinds of training to deliver it. Summary points on current practice within CHaL From visiting six of the London Children\u2019s hospices and Little Havens in Essex, it was clear that they had advanced staff learning and development in different ways according to available time and skills.  With limited capacity and different strengths, it seems clear that are benefits from sharing what they have done in a more systematic way. 85 Establishing mandatory training is a major task and the detailed work from one hospice is an example of what can be shared, especially as hospices are essentially providing the same broad training to their staff. Induction courses are seen as the most likely starting point for shared training. It is possible to combine all of the current training topics, aspects of current practice, available training resources and good practice in learning, and to link these to external forces such as the CQC standards and legislative requirements (see Table 1 p15.). A shared strategy template can be set out encompassing the key elements of existing strategy  documents  (see  Appendix  4).    However,  the  detail  in  policy  and  strategy documents is often used to promote a hospice\u2019s values and visions and build a learning culture, and this will be a challenge if the needs of all hospices are to be accommodated in a single document. Hospices  in  the  CHaL  group  are  similar  in  that  they  do  not  make  much  use  of competencies that have been developed elsewhere, but they have a shared vision of the topics they need to cover and are interested in sharing what individual members have written. With most hospices finding it difficult to measure performance, there could be benefits in working together on how skills deficits are identified and assessed. There is considerable consensus between the CHaL group in terms of their preferred styles of learning, wanting to foster a positive learning culture and follow best practice.","cites":null},{"id":1097872,"title":"The theory behind practical evaluation.","authors":[],"date":"1996","doi":null,"raw":"Scriven, M.
