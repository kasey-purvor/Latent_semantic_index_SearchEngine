INTRODUCTION\nThe recent advances and miniaturization trends in wire-\nless communications require the use of efficient and tunable\nmicrowave systems such as smart transmitters and\nreceivers.1 These in turn require tunable microwave compo-\nnents and in this connection, there has over the past decade\nbeen significant interest in thin film ferroelectrics. The fea-\nture of interest in these materials is the large variation in\ndielectric constant with applied electric field,2 which makes\nthem ideal candidates for passive components with poten-\ntially high tunability and low loss. Thin film BaxSr1\u2212xTiO3\n\u0001BST\u0002 has been the most studied material to date with dielec-\ntric constant tunabilities up to 92.7% using rf sputtering3 and\ndielectric losses as low as 7\u000310\u22123 using metal-organic solu-\ntion deposition4 and pulsed laser deposition \u0001PLD\u00025\nachieved. The PbxSr1\u2212xTiO3 \u0001PST\u0002 system is similar to the\nBST system, in that the Curie temperature \u0001TC\u0002 for the cubic-\nto-tetragonal transition can be adjusted over a large tempera-\nture range by adjusting the A-site atom ratio and has been\nresearched as a promising candidate for thin film tunable\nmicrowave applications since Somiya et al.6 reported dielec-\ntric loss values of less than 0.1% in PST ceramics. Although\nthin film PST deposited by rf sputtering,7 PLD,8 and metal-\norganic chemical vapor deposition9 has been reported, fewer\nstudies have been targeted at sol-gel PST on Si substrates,10\nwhich can be appealing for device manufacture, as it is low\ncost and can be deposited over large areas on Si substrates.\nFurthermore, there has been little effort on directly measur-\ning the microwave performance of PST films.9 Enhanced di-\nelectric properties with Mg11 and La12 doping of PST have\nbeen reported, and in this work, doping of PST with Mn\u2014a\nB-site acceptor dopant well known for lowering dielectric\nloss in perovskite ferroelectrics13\u2014has been investigated and\nthe dielectric properties in the frequency range of 1\u201325 GHz\nextracted from rf measurements on fabricated parallel-plate\ncapacitors.\nIn the course of this work, a new extraction method,\nwhich takes parasitic impedances fully into account, is de-\nscribed in some detail. Also with the now well known peaks\nin dielectric loss due to electrostriction14 being observed, the\npossible usefulness of this effect in PST has been investi-\ngated.\nII. PST THIN FILM\nSol-gel \u0001Pb0.4Sr0.6\u0002\u0001Ti1\u2212x ,Mnx\u0002O3, thin films with x=0,\n0.01, 0.03, and 0.05, were deposited on Pt \/Ti \/SiO2 \/Si sub-\nstrates. The films were characterized by x-ray diffraction and\nscanning electron microscopy \u0001SEM\u0002 and shown to be well\ncrystallized with a dense uniform grain structure and to ex-\nhibit a notable decrease in grain size with increasing Mn\nconcentration. To obtain the low frequency dielectric proper-\nties, Cr\/Au dots were applied and capacitance and loss were\nmeasured using a Wayne Kerr 6425 precision component\nanalyzer. It was found that the 3 mol % Mn films had the\nhighest dielectric constant and tunability with maximum val-\nues of \u00031000 and 72%, respectively\u2014see Fig. 1\u2014measured\nat 100 KHz and these films were chosen for further high\nfrequency characterization. The capacitance variation in a\nlimited range around room temperature was measured and\nthe monotonic decrease with temperature observed indicated\nthat the material is in the paraelectric state at room tempera-\nture.a\u0002Electronic mail: h_frangiadakis@hotmail.com.\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 105, 061635 \u00012009\u0002\n0021-8979\/2009\/105\u00026\u0001\/061635\/7\/$25.00 \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics105, 061635-1\nDownloaded 05 May 2010 to 138.250.112.33.

DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF HIGH FREQUENCY\nTEST STRUCTURES\nThere are a number of possible measurement configura-\ntions for high frequency impedance characterization of ferro-\nelectric films, but all have in common the requirement to\nfacilitate connection to a network analyzer via on-wafer\nground-signal-ground rf probes. Metal-insulator-metal\n\u0001MIM\u0002 capacitors are preferred to interdigital capacitors both\nfor varactor devices and test structures, as these have lower\noperating voltages. Bao et al.15 and Suzuki et al.16 reported\nthe use of one-port reflection measurements of MIM capaci-\ntors for characterization of ferroelectric varactors, including\nshort de-embedding structures, but both these are prone to\ncontact resistance or probe dependency problems which have\nsignificant impact on measurement errors.17 According to\nCramer et al.18 and Zhu et al.,19 two-port measurement tech-\nniques can overcome these limitations, but the configurations\nthey have used have limitations themselves. That of Cramer\net al.18 is only suitable for large area capacitors and that of\nZhu et al.19 has two MIM capacitors in series, which pre-\nsumes that bias voltage is equally distributed between them.\nThe configuration used to characterize the microwave\nproperties of our PST films is based on the design proposed\nby Kulke et al.,20 shown in Fig. 2. This was chosen particu-\nlarly for its suitability for two-port measurements of the very\nsmall overlap area \u0001\u00045\u00035 \u0005m2\u0002 MIM capacitors used in\nthe present work. The coplanar waveguide \u0001CPW\u0002 dimen-\nsions were chosen so as to have an impedance of approxi-\nmately 50 \u0006 and the capacitor impedance was also chosen\nto be within an order of magnitude of this for high accuracy\nmeasurements. The signal linewidth was WS=0.1 mm and\nthe gap was WG=0.08 mm.\nThe equivalent circuit, shown in Fig. 3, is similar to that\nused by Kulke et al.20 but includes the impedances due to\noverlap of the top and bottom electrodes and also a resis-\ntance in parallel with the PST capacitance to account for the\ndielectric loss. RTE, RBE, LTE, and LBE are the resistances and\ninductances of the top and bottom electrodes in the MIM\nstack, while RPST and CPST are the resistance and capacitance\nof the PST thin film. CGAP represents the parasitic capaci-\ntance between the open end of the top electrode and the\ncenter strip conductor below the ferroelectric film. Also, CP1\nand CP2 are the parasitic shunt capacitances of the MIM\nstack to the CPW ground. As assumed by Kulke et al.,20\nCGAP, CP1, and CP2 are very small for the dimensions used\nand can be neglected. In the case of the simplified equivalent\ncircuit displayed in Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002, the impedance, ZS, of the signal\npath can be calculated analytically as follows:\nZS = REL + j\u0007LEL +\n1\nGPST + j\u0007CPST\n,\nREL = RTE + RTE, LEL = LTE + LTE, GPST =\n1\nRPST\n. \u00011\u0002\nIV. FABRICATION PROCESS FOR PST TEST\nSTRUCTURES\nPST MIM capacitors were fabricated on 4 in. diameter\nthermally oxidized high resistivity Si wafers. In these de-\nvices, the process described earlier was used to deposit thin\nfilm PST to a thickness of 250 nm on top of a 100 nm thick\nrf magnetron sputtered Pt layer, which had been previously\npatterned using a lift-off process. The thermal oxide serves\ntwo purposes: it acts as a barrier against products, principally\nPb from the PST sol diffusing into the Si, and also prevents\ninteraction of the Pt and Si at the high temperatures used for\nPST growth. A convenient feature of PST in contrast to thin\nfilm PZT, for example, is that it can be deposited on SiO2\nwithout need of an additional barrier layer to prevent delete-\nrious interactions between the sol and SiO2. To form the\nspecific capacitor areas and provide access to the bottom\nelectrode, the PST film was etched using a dilute HF\/HCl\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Dielectric constant tunability and dielectric loss at\n100 KHz as a function of applied electric field for 3% mol Mn2+ PST\nmeasured on a 0.75 mm diameter circular capacitor.\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Schematic cross sections showing \u0001a\u0002 the CPW con-\nfiguration and \u0001b\u0002 the layer stack of the MIM capacitor.\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Two-port network equivalent circuits for MIM ca-\npacitor rf measurements: \u0001a\u0002 with connecting CPWs included, \u0001b\u0002 showing\nthe lumped element equivalent circuit of the MIM capacitor alone, and \u0001c\u0002\nsimplified lumped element equivalent of the MIM capacitor.\n061635-2 Fragkiadakis et al.

For the top electrode, 150 nm of rf magnetron sput-\ntered Au were used as a seed layer for a 1.7 \u0005m electro-\nplated Ni layer in order to reduce the Ohmic losses. The\nfabricated devices are shown in Fig. 4.\nV. AUTOMATIC DIELECTRIC PROPERTY EXTRACTION\nTECHNIQUE\nTo accurately calculate the frequency dependent dielec-\ntric properties\u2014mainly the dielectric constant, loss, and\ntunability\u2014from two-port S-parameter measurements of the\nCPW MIM test structures, it is necessary to evaluate CPST\nand RPST at every frequency step. The MIM capacitor\u2019s in-\ntrinsic S-parameters were obtained by cascade\nde-embedding21 of the connecting CPWs seen in Fig. 5, thus\nbringing the reference plane from the probe tips to the over-\nlap of the MIM capacitor.\nThe probe pads were treated as an additional length of\ntransmission line since they have the same geometry as the\nconnecting CPWs. The frequency dependent propagation\nconstant and characteristic impedance of the connecting\nCPWs were evaluated by separate S-parameter measure-\nments on a single 0.5 mm CPW, fabricated directly on the\nsubstrate and implementation of existing formulas,22\n\u0006A BC D \u0007 = \b\n\u00011 + S11\u0002\u00011 \u2212 S22\u0002 + S12S21\n2S21\nZ0\n\u00011 + S11\u0002\u00011 + S22\u0002 \u2212 S12S21\n2S21\n1\nZ0\n\u00011 \u2212 S11\u0002\u00011 \u2212 S22\u0002 \u2212 S12S21\n2S21\n\u00011 \u2212 S11\u0002\u00011 + S22\u0002 + S12S21\n2S21\n\t , \u00012\u0002\nZ0l =\nBC , \b = 10.0005cosh\u22121\u0001A\u0002 , \u00013\u0002\nwhere Z0l is the characteristic impedance of the CPW and \b\nis the propagation constant of the electromagnetic wave.\nThen the Ain and Aout were deducted from the lossy\ntransmission line formula,\n\u0006A BC D \u0007 = \b cosh\u0001\bl\u0002 Z0l sinh\u0001\bl\u00021\nZ0l\nsinh\u0001\bl\u0002 cosh\u0001\bl\u0002 \t , \u00014\u0002\nwhere l is the length of connecting CPWs before and after\nthe MIM. Finally the MIM\u2019s intrinsic ABCD matrix was ex-\ntracted by means of\n\u0004Apure\u0005 = \u0004Ain\u0005\u22121\u0004Aor\u0005\u0004Aout\u0005\u22121, \u00015\u0002\nwhere Aor is the full original measured matrix. The resulting\nApure was converted back to S-parameters. Based on the \t\nequivalent circuit for a general two port,23 the intrinsic MIM\nstack de-embedded data \u0001Apure\u0002 could then be fitted to the\nequivalent MIM lumped element circuit. To do this, the de-\nembedded S-parameters were converted to Y-parameters.24\nEvaluating the admittance YS from Eq. \u00011\u0002, after some trans-\nformations, we arrive at\nRe\u0001YS\u0002 =\nRELGPST\n2 + GPST + \u00072CPST\n2 REL\n\u0001RELGPST \u2212 \u00072LELCPST + 1\u00022 + \u0001\u0007RELCPST + \u0007LELGPST\u00022\n, \u00016\u0002\nFIG. 4.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nIm\u0001YS\u0002 =\n\u0007CPST \u2212 \u0007LELGPST\n2\n\u2212 \u00073LELCPST\n2\n\u0001RELGPST \u2212 \u00072LELCPST + 1\u00022 + \u0001\u0007RELCPST + \u0007LELGPST\u00022\n. \u00017\u0002\nIt can be seen that there are two equations with four un-\nknowns \u0001GPST, REL, CPST, and LEL\u0002.\nAs the length of the capacitor \u00015 \u0005m\u0002 is very small\ncompared to the wavelength \u0001e.g., 15 mm at 20 GHz\u0002, the\nMIM capacitor can be considered as a lumped element and\nthe top and bottom electrodes combined are considered as a\nresistor REL and inductor LEL in series. REL can then be ap-\nproximated as follows:\nREL = RTE + RBE =\n\nTEl\ntTEw\n+\n\nBEl\ntBEw\n, \u00018\u0002\nwhere \nTE and \nBE are the resistivities of the metals used for\nthe top and bottom electrodes, l is the length of the top elec-\ntrode, w is the width of the top electrode, and tTE and tBE are\nthe thicknesses of the top and bottom electrodes, respec-\ntively.\nFor this particular test structure, the platinum bottom\nelectrode having a thickness of only 100 nm dominates the\ntotal resistance of the electrodes and would be the main fac-\ntor limiting the Q of a potential PST varactor. However, a\nway to overcome this which has been recently\ndemonstrated25 is to transfer bond the fabricated device onto\na separate substrate which would enable the bottom electrode\nto be thickened up. The total inductance, LEL=LTE+LBE, can\nbe approximately extracted from the measured self-\nresonance of the MIM capacitor\u2019s phase and was found to be\napproximately 0.02 nH. This small inductance, along with\nthe electrode resistance, can give rise to large characteriza-\ntion errors if neglected\u2014see Fig. 6\u2014by forming a resonator\nwith the test capacitor, but these can be fully accounted for if\nEqs. \u00016\u0002 and \u00017\u0002 are used.\nUsing the symbolic toolbox of MATLAB, the algorithm\nsolves all the equations, outputting the frequency dependent\nvalues of CPST and RPST. The Palmer formula is used to relate\nthe capacitance to the dielectric constant of the PST due to\nthe small area of capacitor and the effect of the fringing\ncapacitance,26\nC =\n\u0001wl\nd \u000b1 + d\tw\u00061 + ln\f2\twd \r\u0007\u000e\u000b1 + d\tw\u00061\n+ ln\f2\twd \r\u0007\u000e . \u00019\u0002\nFinally the dielectric loss is computed by\ntan \u0002 =\n1\nRPST\u0007CPST\n. \u000110\u0002\nVI. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS\nAfter having first carried out an accurate line-reflect-\nreflect-match \u0001LRRM\u0002 calibration using a cascade calibration\nsubstrate to bring the reference plane to the probe tips,\nS-parameter measurements from 1 to 25 GHz were made\nusing an Agilent E8361A vector network analyzer \u0001VNA\u0002\nand a Cascade Microtech Summit 12000 automatic probe\nstation with 1601 frequency points and an intermediate fre-\nquency \u0001IF\u0002 bandwidth of 300 Hz. The contact position and\ncontact pressure of the probes were initially adjusted and\nthen fixed, so as to ensure reproducibility of the measure-\nments. Also, the microscope light was turned off during the\nmeasurements\u2014to avoid photovoltaic effects in the highly\nresistive silicon\u2014and sufficient time was allowed for stabi-\nlization of the measurements. Contact sensitivity experi-\nments revealed that for five subsequent measurements \u0001in\nwhich contacts were made and released\u0002, the capacitance and\nloss ratio of standard deviation over mean values were less\nthan 1% and 3%, respectively.\nThe MIM capacitors were biased up to 6 V\n\u0001=240 kV \/cm\u0002 via the VNA\u2019s external bias ports and the\nextracted PST dielectric values are shown in Fig. 7. The\ndevices broke down prematurely \u0001at \u00036.5 V\u0002 compared to\nlow frequency measurements, an effect that has yet to be\nunderstood but, as observed by Xu et al.,27 may be due to\nsurface leakage and so may be amenable to the solution they\nused, which was to include a SiO2 passivation layer. There is\nlittle change in the extracted dielectric properties with \u0001\n\u00031000 and tan \u0002\u00030.03 in the range of 1\u20135 GHz, and these\nagree quite well with low frequency measurements. In this\nregime, the material would be suitable for many frequency\nagile applications although not at the high performance end,\nrequiring tan \u0002\u000b0.01. The observed tunability, \u000350%, is not\nconsidered representative as it was affected by the earlier\nnoted premature device breakdown but would need to be\nincreased up to, and preferably beyond, the observed low\nfrequency value of 72% for useful device operation.

Although these acoustic vibrations can be deleterious\nto varactor operation, particularly with regard to tan \u0002, de-\nvices can be carefully designed to suppress them.30 Further-\nmore, these acoustic resonances have already been made use\nof31,32 in thin film bulk acoustic resonators for tunable appli-\ncations. As shown in Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002, small loss peaks are present\neven at zero bias, which suggests that the PST has some\nweak background piezoelectricity. These have also been ob-\nserved by Gevorgian et al.14 in SrTiO3 and following his\nsuggestion these may be due to a lowering of the symmetry\nof the crystal lattice caused by thin film stress.\nTo investigate the possible usefulness of this effect in\nPST, a one dimensional Mason model has been developed\nsimilar to those previously presented for SrTiO3 and\nBST.14,33 In this model, the well known formalism used for\ndescribing piezoelectric transducer operation has been modi-\nfied to allow for field dependence of the effective piezoelec-\ntric and elastic constants and hence also of the electrome-\nchanical coupling coefficient \u0001k33\n2 \u0002 and acoustic velocity\n\u0001Vac\u0002\u2014the parameters that appear directly in the equations.\nVII. ACOUSTIC MODELING\nUsing solutions of the one dimensional plane wave\nboundary value problem as given by Rosenbaum34 and\nLakin,35 a piezoelectric layer\u2014in this case PST\u2014with me-\nchanically loaded end faces has the following electrical im-\npedance:\nZ =\n1\nj\u0007C0\f1 \u2212 K2 tan\u0001\f\u0002\f zPST\u0001zt + zb\u0002cos\n2\u0001\f\u0002 + jzPST2 sin\u00012\f\u0002\nzPST\u0001zt + zb\u0002cos\u00012\f\u0002 + j\u0001zPST2 + ztzb\u0002sin\u00012\f\u0002\n\r . \u000111\u0002\nK2=k33\n2 \/ \u00011+k33\n2 \u0002, \f=\rd \/2, and \r=\u0007 \/Vac, where \u0007 is the\nangular frequency, Vac is the PST acoustic velocity, d is the\nthickness of the PST film, \u0001zt\u0002, \u0001zb\u0002 zPST are the acoustic\nimpedances at the top and bottom end faces and of the PST\nfilm, respectively, and k33\n2 is the longitudinal electromechani-\ncal coupling coefficient.\nZt and Zb are obtained by successive application of the\ntransmission line equation to all the layers in the device\nstack. Starting from the outermost layer \u0001i=1\u0002 the impedance\nat the i \/ i+1 boundary is\nZi\/i+1 = Zi\fZi\/i\u22121 cosh\u0001\bidi\u0002 + Zi sinh\u0001\bidi\u0002Zi cosh\u0001\bidi\u0002 + Zi\/i\u22121 sinh\u0001\bidi\u0002\r , \u000112\u0002\nwhere Z0, Zi, and \bi, di are the acoustic impedances of the\nzeroth layer, air \u0001taken as zero\u0002 and layer i, and the propaga-\ntion constant and thickness of layer i, respectively.\nThe propagation constant \bi is related to the acoustic\nattenuation \u0001\u000ei\u0002 and wave number \u0001\ri\u0002 by \bi=\u000ei+ j\ri,\n\u000ei=\u0007 \/2VacQi, \ri=\u0007 \/Vac, and Qi is the acoustic quality fac-\ntor of each material. Although Qi varies with frequency and\nphenomenologically it is found to have a f\u22121 dependence34 in\nmany materials, for simplicity in this work it was assumed\nfrequency independent and the values used for the different\nlayers in the structure are given along with other acoustic\nproperties in Table I. Finally, acoustic attenuation for the\nPST thin film is introduced in Eq. \u000111\u0002 as a resistive term by\nadding an imaginary part into the phase \f,\n\fPST = \f \u0007Vac \u2212 j\u000ePST\rdPST. \u000113\u0002\nFIG. 7. \u0001Color online\u0002 Extracted values for \u0001a\u0002 dielectric constant and \u0001b\u0002\ndielectric loss of the thin film PST up to 240 kV\/cm applied electric field.\n061635-5 Fragkiadakis et al.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nIn the absence of firm data for PST, values for SrTiO314\nwere used as an approximation. It is also important to note\nthat both k33\n2 and Vac for PST are field dependent, the field\ndependence of Vac following from the relation34\nVac = Vac\n\u00010\u0002\n\u00011 + k332 \u0002 , \u000114\u0002\nand Vac\n\u00010\u0002\n=\nc \/\n, where c is the appropriate elastic constant of\nPST.\nTaking measured rf data for four bias fields \u00010, 80, 160,\nand 240 KV\/cm\u0002, the best fit for these\u2014shown in Fig. 8\u0001a\u0002\u2014\nwas obtained by making fine adjustments to the parameters,\nprincipally the acoustic velocities in Pt and Ni, until with\nthese fixed it was only necessary to vary k33\n2 to obtain best fit\nfor the different biases. In Fig. 8\u0001b\u0002 the plot for 240 kV\/cm\nbias field has been selected and compared with measured\ndata. As can be seen the fit is quite good: the difference\nbetween the model\u2019s predicted resonant frequencies and the\nmeasured values is never more than 5%. However, to get a\nbetter fit, especially to the magnitude of the resonances, more\naccurate material properties and frequency dependent acous-\ntic quality factors must be used. The resulting k33\n2 variation\nwith bias field is shown in Fig. 8\u0001c\u0002 and is roughly linear as\nwould be expected for electrostrictive behavior. An interest-\ning feature is the observed maximum value of k33\n2 \u00030.04\nwhich is significantly higher than the value for the same\nfield, \u00030.013, recently reported by Noeth et al.33 for\nBa0.3Sr0.7TiO3. Although k33\n2 may be lower due to the slightly\ncomposite nature of the resonant structure used by Noeth et\nal.,33 it does show that the effect in PST would be potentially\nuseful for tunable thin film bulk acoustic resonator \u0001FBAR\u0002\napplications. As noted above, there is also a slight piezoelec-\ntric response even at zero bias, which translates into a very\nsmall but still existent electromechanical coupling coefficient\n\u0001k33\n2 \u00030.0025\u0002.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nThe sol-gel growth of 3% Mn doped PST films with\ngood crystallinity and dense uniform grain structure on 4 in.\nSi wafers has been demonstrated. MIM capacitors have also\nbeen fabricated and development of an improved de-\nembedding technique that takes into account the whole test\nstructure impedance has enabled accurate extraction from\nthese high frequency dielectric properties of the PST films.\nIn the low gigahertz range \u00011\u20135 GHz\u0002 practically useful val-\nues of \u0001\u00031000 and tan \u0002\u00030.03 have been obtained. Al-\nthough a similarly useful tunability of 72% has been ob-\ntained on low frequency test structures, further work is\nneeded to understand the premature breakdown effect which\nhas limited the rf tunability to \u000350%. Peaks in the dielectric\nloss due to acoustic resonance have been modeled and found\nto be in accordance with electrostrictive behavior and the\nTABLE I.
