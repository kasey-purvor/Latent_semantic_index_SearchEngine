This increased emphasis on \nlearning from practice, coupled with government targets doubling the number \nof social work students, brought many challenges to those involved in \ndelivering and supporting the social work degree. Not least, the need to \nensure the sufficiency and quality of practice learning opportunities \n(Williams, 2008).  \n \nThe social work degree is no longer new and continues to evolve  \nin an atmosphere of professional challenge and change. For example, the \nvalidity of the social work profession continues to be questioned by high \nprofile cases such as Baby Peter and the perceived failure of social workers to \nintervene effectively in the lives of the most vulnerable children. The roles and \nresponsibilities of social work have been both formally examined by \ngovernment (GSCC, 2008 ) and informally questioned by the public \nand press. Given this context, and the current review of both the social \nwork degree and the establishment of a social work taskforce, it is right that \nthe profession considers the way it prepares students to become practitioners \nboth in terms of the teaching input provided by the universities and the \npractice learning provided in the workplace.  \n \nThe latter component is often viewed by students as being the most \nimportant part of their education and is seen by employers as an opportunity for \nstudents to engage in 'proper' hands on social work (Doel and Shardlow, 1996). \nWhilst it would be not be wise to uncritically accept the popularity and \neffectiveness of the placement, it is clear that it forms an integral part of student \nlearning and is often highly valued.  \n \nSocial work placements in the UK are configured in a number of different \nways, using a number of different models. For example, the private, \nvoluntary and independent social care sector is increasingly being used as a \nsource of placements in a way which would have been unthinkable a few years \nago (Doel et al 2007). Creative supervisory arrangements are also being \nused, sometimes involving an off site practice educator (PE) and an on \nsite supervisor.(Doel et al 2007). The two hundred day requirement is also \nconfigured in a number of innovative ways by universities according to local \nneed and demand.  \n \nCentral to the arrangement of all placements, however, is the use of a PE who \nfulfils a number of important roles including oversight and supervision, \ndirect teaching, and critically the evaluation of competency (Danbury, \n1994). The function and influence of the PE has been widely researched and \nthe role is ordinarily viewed as being essential to the success or failure of the \nplacement. The literature tends to echo a number of recurrent themes; the \ncentrality of the PE to student learning, the way the student models their practice \non the PE, and the significance of the inspiration\/encouragement\/guidance \nprovided by the PE (Doel and Shardlow,1996; Parker, 2004; Buck, 2007).  \n \nIn particular, research highlights the notion that the relationship between the \nPE and the student is of crucial importance. Lefevre (2005) traces the historical \nevolution of this relationship from being a quasi therapeutic, psycho \ndynamic type of relationship, in the early days of practice teaching, to a \nmore egalitarian, functional relationship in contemporary social work. \nWhilst it might be possible to generalise about the evolution of styles and \nmethods within practice teaching, educational relationships are complex \nand varied. Whether the relationship is as simple, or the progression as clear \ncut as portrayed, is open to debate. These misgivings apart, Lefevre (2005) \nprovides an interesting study on the significance of relationship and concludes \nthat feelings of anxiety, vulnerability, lack of confidence and dependency \nexhibited by students on placement were often a response to how the \nrelationship between them and their PE was developed and sustained. Students \nwho experienced a nurturing relationship characterised by openness, \nencouragement and creativity were far more likely to thrive than those who had \nan inflexible and uncaring relationship with their PE. This theme has been \nechoed by previous studies which found that student feedback on \nproblematical placements often reflected the absence of a positive relationship \nbetween student and PE (Urbanowski and Dwyer,1988; Rosenblatt and Mayer, \n1975).  \n \nWhilst the importance of the PE should not be underestimated, other \nsignificant relational influences within the placement setting have not been so \nwidely researched. It could be argued that a placement is a complex mix of \nrelationships and influences, some negative, some positive. A student rarely \nenters a placement entirely unsupported. They often bring with them a \ndiverse set of relationships comprising family, friends, other students, and \nuniversity support systems. All of these relationships exert an influence on the \nstudent's ability to make sense of their placement and to achieve learning whilst \non placement.  \n \nEqually, the PE does not work in isolation but is reliant on an evolving, \neclectic set of relationships to assist him\/her in making work available to the \nstudent, monitoring that work, and making objective decisions about \ncompetency. In other words, the PE requires the support of colleagues, managers, \nadministrative staff, external agencies, service users and carers if the placement \nis to succeed.  \n \nThis article, based on ongoing research, provides a student perspective on the \nsignificance of these wider relationships as a means of support, or hindrance, to \nthe placement experience. In particular, it examines the role of the university \nbased tutor, the influence of the wider team in which the placement occurs \nand the helpfulness, or otherwise, of family, friends and other students.  \n \n \nThe study  \n \nIn 2008 the Lincoln campus of the University of Lincoln celebrated the \ngraduation of the first cohort of students from its BSc (Hons) Social Work \nprogramme. Given the landmark nature of this event, it felt appropriate to \nevaluate the success of the degree from a student and employer perspective. \nAn innovative research study, involving both academic staff and current \nstudents, was commenced to evaluate the extent to which the programme \nequips students for professional practice.  \n \nThe initial phase of the research obtained the views of students \nimmediately following qualification through a mixed methods approach using \nquestionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Social work training at the \nUniversity of Lincoln is offered at two sites; Lincoln and Hull. The \nquestionnaire was distributed to all graduates (n = 118) constituting 39 \ngraduates at the Lincoln Campus and 79 graduates at the Hull Campus. A \ntotal of 25 questionnaires were received from students at the Lincoln campus, \ngiving a response rate of 64.1%. Nine questionnaires were returned from the \nHull campus, giving a response rate of 11.4%.  \n \nWhilst it is acknowledged that the return rate is a limitation of the study, nine \nrespondents ( 6 from Lincoln and 3 from Hull) subsequently agreed to take part \nin an in depth semi structured interview and the combined data was analysed. \nThe questionnaire provided a considerable amount of background data \nconcerning students' views of the course, whilst the interviews provided a more \ndetailed analysis.  \nThe initial data analysis raised a number of issues regarding  \nhow students are prepared for professional practice, including the \nsignificance of practice learning and the relationships which impact on \nstudents on placement. In particular, students provided interesting observations \nabout the role of the university tutor and how they viewed  \ntheir relationship with them.  \n \nThe role of the university tutor  \n \nComparatively little research has been undertaken into the role of the \nuniversity tutor within social work education. Tutors traditionally have a \nvariety of tasks encompassing the development of academic and \nprofessional skills, as well as a broad pastoral\/welfare role, with individual \nstudents. This role is often in addition to formal teaching and pedagogical \ncommitments. Contact with tutees is limited and often confined to \nperiodic group or individual tutorials throughout the academic year. \nDegenhardt (2003) further suggests that this level of support has diminished \nin recent years due to a diminution of resources, as opposed to sound \neducational reasoning. Moreover, it is not always the case that university \ntutors take responsibility for their 'own' tutorial group once they go out on \nplacement. Consequently, prior contact between students and those tutors \nwho support them on placement can be limited.  \n \nPrior to going on placement students were provided with a number of  'preparation \nfor placement' days which offered advice and guidance on all aspects of placement \nlife. Some tutors who would go on to provide placement support were \ninvolved in these days, but the majority of preparation was undertaken by \nthe university Placement Co-ordinator and a small team of experienced PE's. \nSupport to students on placement is given priority by the university but is often at \narms length - telephone contact, e-mail correspondence, informal discussion at \nrecall days, etc. Formally only two meetings take place with the tutor in the \nplacement setting; one at the beginning to chair the learning agreement and \none mid way through the placement to review learning and progress. The \nlearning agreement places the onus on the student and PE to contact the \nuniversity tutor should problems occur. If difficulties do emerge additional \nface to face support is provided.  \n \nThe research literature perhaps reflects this limited contact by implying \nthat both students and PE's hold ambivalent views regarding the role and \nsignificance of the university tutor in the management of the placement. For \nexample, Sharp (2000) found that PE's sometimes felt undermined by tutors in \nthe difficult task of failing a student and that their input was not particularly \nvalued. Other studies indicate that PE's feel that tutors do not communicate as \noften as they should, do not sufficiently value the centrality of the role of the PE, \nand are viewed as being peripheral to the placement by both PE and student \n(Burgess and Phillips,2000; Shardlow and Doel, 2002). \n  \nThis ambivalence, however, was not fully reflected by the responses given in the \nstudy. Data analysis of the questionnaires indicated a high degree of satisfaction \nwith the role of staff in the university teaching and tutorial setting with thirty one \n(76.4%) respondents indicating that staff were 'extremely important' or 'quite \nimportant' to their development. Crucially, no students indicated that staff were 'not \nvery important' or 'not at all important' to their development whilst at university. Staff \nthen were valued and seen to be of significance when undertaking university \nbased teaching and support roles.  \n \nThe semi structured interviews, however, found that respondents expressed \ndivergent opinions concerning the quality of support they received from \ntheir university tutor whilst on placement. Five out of nine respondents \nexpressed positive views, whilst the remaining four respondents were more \ncritical.  \n \nNegative views of tutors tended to echo the criticisms raised within the \nliterature. For example, one student in particular seemed to have great \ndifficulty with her tutor who changed appointments, seemed to be rushed \non his visits, was unwilling to look at her work and generally failed to \nprovide adequate support. Another criticism from two interviewees was that \ntutors 'didn't do anything' even when they were aware of difficulties.  \n' I  used to ring her up and say, look this placement is not working, I'm not getting  \nout of it what I should be getting out of it. Could you do something about it? \u2026  \nand she would come in and sit there and not do a lot really.'  \n \nTwo other interviewees indicated that they had had issues on placement \nbut failed to contact their tutors because they did not feel confident that they \nwould receive a helpful response. These negative experiences, however, were \nnot typical of the cohort and other students indicated that they had received \ngood support on placement.  \n \nWhat students valued about their tutor can be broken down into three \ndiscrete elements. Firstly, students appreciated a responsive tutor - someone who \nresponded to e-mails, who replied to messages left for them and kept pre-\narranged appointments. In passing, we may reflect that these attributes are the \nsame as those mentioned by service users when referring to social workers. \nSpeaking of the tutors who supported her on both of her placements, one \ninterviewee said  \n \n.. both of them attended their appointments as arranged, they were there, they  \nresponded to e-mails, telephone calls when I had things to clarify or issues .... I \nknow when I e-mailed I got a response, if I needed support I know they both  \nwould have been there.'  \n \nStudents also valued a tutor who actively supported them at times of crisis. This \nwas not only support provided when students felt nervous about the \nplacement or how they were to evidence their competency, but help at times \nof personal crisis. For example, two interviewees spoke of family and \nrelationship problems that had adversely affected them on placement. Whilst \ntheir PE and other members of the team were supportive, it was the \nuniversity tutor who provided the most assistance. For example, one \nstudent recalled having difficulties on her first placement and telephoning \nher university tutor in tears. Her concerns were recognised and acted upon. A \nsecond interviewee stated  \n \nI had a lot of things going on in the second placement as well, personal life,  \nand he was able to really support me in that way and I was very appreciative \nbecause with all the stuff that was going on in my home life with family it was  \nvery difficult to undertake any sort of further study.  \n \nFinally, students also valued tutors who pushed them to succeed or challenged \nthem about their practice. This appeared to be an extension of the pedagogical \nrelationship that had previously existed in the campus setting. One \ninterviewee acknowledged that her placement tutor had always \nacademically pushed her and encouraged her to do better. Another \ninterviewee stated that her tutor was especially skilful at challenging her to see \nhow theory fitted with practice, or to consider different ways of working \nduring placement visits. These insights were clearly valued as they gave \nadded impetus to the placement and reinforced the work of the PE.  \n \nIt is interesting that both positive and negative experiences of the support \nprovided by university tutors to students on placement seem to reflect pre-\nexisting relationships. For example, the interviewee who expressed most \nconcern regarding her lack of support had complained at the commencement \nof her placement that she did not want the tutor allocated to her as her \nexperience of him at university led her to doubt his ability to motivate her or \nto keep appointments. Yet those interviewees (n=5) who spoke positively of \ntheir relationship with their tutor on placement noted that they already had a \ngood relationship with them from their contact at university. Consequently, they \nfelt that their working relationship was already sufficiently well developed as to \ngive them confidence that they would be appropriately supported.  \n \nIn summary, whilst contact with university based tutors was sometimes \nlimited, the quality of their input and the timeliness of their response was \nvalued by students. Pre-existing relationships formed between individual \nstudents and tutors also seemed to offer some indication, at least in \nstudents' minds, as to how good the support provided by the tutor would \nbe. Whilst university based staff are undoubtedly pressurised they need to \nrecognise that the creation and development of a positive working \nrelationship with their students is highly valued - both in the campus and on \nplacement.  \n \n \nThe role of the wider team  \n \nContemporary social work education is firmly sited within a multi \ndisciplinary, inter professional framework. As social workers are now \nemployed in a range of organisations, working alongside an array of other \nprofessionals, it is appropriate that social work placements reflect the \ncomplexities and dynamism of practice. As has been previously argued, \nplacements do not take place in a vacuum and students need to learn how to \nbuild and use positive relationships with a range of people who will be \npresent in their placement setting.  \n \nAll nine interviewees were asked about the role of the wider team in their \ndevelopment whilst on placement. A common theme, noted by three \nstudents, was the opportunity to learn from other professionals who were \nmembers of the wider team. As one interviewee stated:  \n \n... without a doubt the team were fantastic. It was a multi disciplinary team and  \nI learned so much from everybody. There were probation  officers, police officers,  \neducation workers. It was just fantastic. \nWhilst other student experiences may not have been quite as vibrant, it was \nnoticeable that the opportunity to work with and talk with professionals \nfrom other backgrounds was highly prized. Occupational therapists and \ncommunity nurses were singled out as being particularly helpful in providing \nthe opportunity to undertake shared work and joint visits. Again three \ninterviewees mentioned how valuable it was to have 'lots of visits' with non \nsocial care colleagues. This may reflect their learning styles, but may also \nindicate that social work students genuinely do want to learn about other \nprofessional approaches.  \n \nTeams that were viewed as being supportive seemed to have had an explicit \nculture of learning. This was evident in a number of ways. For example, one \nteam had a number of students on placement at the same time, another team had \na lengthy history of providing placements, whilst others seemed to embrace the \nidea of learning through staff and students accessing courses and other forms \nof learning. These teams seemed to welcome students and implicitly gave \nstudents permission to approach a range of team members for advice and \nassistance - not just the PE. For example, one interviewee said;  \n \nEveryone was very supportive and it wasn't like I could only go to my supervisor,  \nI could ask any of them for assistance and they were all more than willing to  \nhelp, so they were all brilliant.  \n \nIt was unclear what motivated these 'teaching teams' to provide such a positive \nexperience. It could be argued that team managers, or experienced \npractitioners within the team, set the tone - although this was not explicitly \nmentioned. Other research indicates that the employing organisation can \nbe ambivalent, even hostile, towards staff to taking on the role of PE \n(Develin and Mathews, 2008). Given these contradictions and uncertainties, \nfurther research is required to examine the role of supportive teams as they \ncan clearly be a source of inspiration.  \n \nNot all teams, however, were so supportive or harmonious. One \ninterviewee, reflecting on her first placement said:  \n \n... they were all very nice but because they didn't understand why I was there  \nI think they didn't include me in a lot of things that I would like to have been  \nincluded on - like different meetings and things like that.  \n \nWhether this was due to poor practice within the team or a lack of proactivity \nfrom the student is unclear, but it highlights the need for universities to be \nrigorous in the way that placements are chosen and learning agreements are \nconfigured.  \n \nAnother interviewee felt that difficulties with relationships and dynamics \nwithin the team impacted on her placement as staff tried to involve her in \ndisputes and arguments. She had the good sense to stay outside of these games \nand reflected that she had learnt a valuable lesson from the experience:  \n \nYou are not always going to work somewhere where everyone gets on. It's not  \nalways going to be rosy and great and you are going to have to find a way of \nmanaging things- conflict resolution. You are going to have to find a way of dealing  \nwith things and working with people, because it's the real world.  \n \nTwo other interviewees challenged what they saw as poor practice in their \nteams. Both expressed concern about their perceived powerless positions as \nstudent learners within established teams and worried as to how their \nchallenges would be viewed. In the event, the teams were sufficiently mature \nand well managed to be able to accept the criticism and work through any \nrelationship difficulties that subsequently arose. Two other students expressed \ndissatisfaction with team members who they did not 'get on with'.  \n \nWe could perhaps reflect that students seemed to have gained a typical and \nvaluable experience of the realities of working in disparate and vibrant teams \nwhere fellow team members are both a source of support and a cause of \nconflict.  \n \nStudents appeared to have minimal contact with team managers. Given the \ncomplexities of team management and the breadth of responsibility that \nmany managers carry, this is not perhaps surprising.  As team managers seem to \ncome to the fore when placements go wrong or where there are issues of \ncompetency or professional concern it would perhaps suggest that none of our \nrespondents were weak practitioners (Sharp & Danbury 1999). This detached \nrelationship between student and team manager is echoed elsewhere in \nresearch that suggests that team managers do not play a pivotal role in \nencouraging staff to become PE's (Develin and Mathews 2008). Two \ninterviewees stated that team managers were supportive and could be \napproached if necessary. One, however, reported that her team warned her \nagainst approaching the team manager due to her firm and inflexible manner.  \n \nFinally, five out of nine interviewees implied that there were \ndifferences in the quality of support they received according to the size of \nthe team in which they were placed. To generalise, the bigger the better! \nLarger teams seemed to be able to provide a greater breadth of experience, and \nwere in a better position to offer inter professional learning.  \nFor example, one interviewee said  \n \n\u2026 on the mental health placement, there was again a variety of professionals  \nin that team including nursing staff, support workers and social workers and  \nconsultants and all sorts..  \nShe noted that the variety of approaches and perspectives was helpful to her \nprofessional development as it encouraged her to think about the role of \nsocial work in a multi disciplinary setting. Smaller teams on the other hand \ncould be stifling, with relationships being intense and inhibiting. For \nexample, one interviewee recalled how her team comprised of herself, a \nmanager & her PE. She felt unable to voice any concerns and hemmed in by \npeople in authority who were continually assessing her.  \n \nBuck (2007) notes the importance of the wider team in her analysis of 'what \nmakes a good placement'. We could further suggest that it is the relationships \nwithin the team, and the relationship that the student makes with the team, that \nis of prime importance. This is echoed by Bradley (2008) in her study of \nthe induction experiences of newly qualified workers where the success of \ntheir induction programme seems to depend on the quality of the relationships \nthe inductee forms with a range of team members including colleagues, \nadministrative staff and managers. If these relationships are 'genuine, warm' \nand supportive the induction process is often felt to be successful. Teams \ntherefore need to promote a learning culture and develop positive inter team \nrelationships if they are to provide vibrant placement experiences. Given the \napparent lack of managerial drive it is unclear how this ethos can be developed \nand sustained. It is unwise to speculate, but it may be driven by a few key \nmembers of staff who have developed a keen interest in practice education.  \n \nSo far we have concentrated on the significance of formal relationships within the \nplacement process. We now turn to those informal relationships which \nwere identified as being of particular importance.  \n \nOther significant relationships  \n \nAll nine respondents indicated that support from family members, friends \nand fellow students had been integral to the successful completion of \nthe degree programme. This support ranged from proof reading assignments, \nproviding 'tea and sympathy' when difficulties arose, sharing ideas and \nresources, offering encouragement and the giving of practical support such \nas help with transport and child care arrangements. The importance of \nthese informal relationships, especially the role of fellow students, has been \npreviously noted (Buck, 2007, Papadaki and Nygren, 2006). In larger \norganisations, where there were a number of students present, students seemed \nable to replicate the supportive relationships they enjoyed in the university \nsetting. Some PE's were able to organise group tutorials which were seen as \nbeing particularly valuable as they facilitated the sharing of ideas and \nexperiences and echoed the familiarity of the university seminar.  \n \nOn placement other relationships, notably the relationship with the PE, \nseem to take precedence over existing informal relationships. What was \nvalued, however, was the sense of permanency and solidity provided by \nfamilies, especially partners and parents, who could be turned to at times of \nstress or crisis. For example, one interviewee who was on a problematical \noverseas placement described contact from her mother as her major source of \nsupport. Without this consistent support she acknowledges that she would not \nhave been able to successfully complete the placement.  \n \nIt is also interesting that students explicitly recognised the centrality of the \nservice user to their learning on placement. One interviewee in particular \nwas able to articulate how service users had assisted her professional \ndevelopment whilst on placement. The direct feedback they gave to her \nhelped to define her strengths and those areas of her professional development \nwhich required attention. She felt that her skill level increased on placement \ndue to her contact with service users, and that she was able to improve her \noverall performance as well as assisting service users to improve their lives:  \n \nI suppose (that) service users have probably been of most importance (on \nplacement) because without them I would not have been able to complete the course.  \n \nThis fundamental relationship is sometimes overlooked in social work \nliterature and it is refreshing that students value the privilege they have of \nlearning from the people they work with.  \n \nConclusion  \n \nThis research has highlighted the significance of a range of relationships which \ncontribute to the success or otherwise of a student placement. The pivotal \nrole of the PE has been deliberately over looked in an attempt to \nconcentrate on the importance of other relationships which are sometimes \nunseen and undervalued. Whilst the PE is always going to remain central to \nthe placement, the importance of these other relationships should not be \nignored as they provide a rich supportive context within which the student \ngrows and develops.  \n \nWhilst it would be unwise to make too many recommendations from such a \nsmall study, the research indicates that placement organisers and university staff \nneed to consider a number of themes.  \n \nFirstly, the importance of creating and sustaining positive \nrelationships between university staff and students. As has been \ndiscussed, student perception of the quality of the support provided by \ntutors on placement seems to reflect pre-existing experience and relationships. \nGiven the pressure of academic life it is not always easy to nurture students in \nthe way that they would like. Nonetheless, it would appear that valued \nrelationships are built on simple building blocks; such as good \ncommunication, keeping appointments, empathy and the ability to promote \nlearning through challenge.  \n \nSecondly, this study highlights how valued placements in an inter \nprofessional setting were and demonstrates that students do want the \nopportunity to work with a range of professionals. Whilst this may not be \n'new news' it does challenge those criticisms that were voiced when the new \ndegree was launched which questioned the validity of placements where \nsocial workers were outnumbered by other professionals. Students value \nthe opportunity to see other professions at work and seem to thrive in a multi \nprofessional atmosphere.  \n \nThirdly, it was perhaps not surprising that students had mixed views of teams. \nSome teams were extremely supportive and further research is required as to \nwhat drives the culture that promotes these 'teaching teams'. A tentative \nconclusion from the study would be that larger teams are better equipped to \nmeet the needs of students. Nonetheless, caution is required here as we may \nspeculate that what students value from teams is the quality of opportunity, \nharmonious team dynamics and working relationships within the team that \npromote a learning environment. This often does not depend on size alone \nbut reflects a more complicated mix of factors such as team management and \nculture. Finally, the study emphasises the importance of context in practice \nlearning. Often the emphasis is on the relationship between student and PE \nwhich can implicitly exclude other significant elements within the teaching \nenvironment. As has been demonstrated, other relationships are crucial to the \nsuccess or failure of the placement.  \n \n \n \nReferences  \n \nBradley, G., (2008) The induction of newly appointed social workers; Some \nimplications for social work educators.
