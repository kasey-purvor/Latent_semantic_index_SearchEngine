The synthetic \nTLR9 agonist, CpG-ODN, can substitute for microbial DNA in these responses, and is in \nclinical trials as an immunomodulatory agent in diseases as diverse as infections, cancer \nand allergic disorders. Human TLR9 is expressed on cells of haematopoietic origin \n(principally plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells), but has also been described as \nbeing expressed on a number of other cell types. In order to clarify the expression and \nfunction of TLR9 in a range of cells of both haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic \norigin, we investigated the level of expression of TLR9 mRNA, and the ability of the \ncells to respond to CpG-ODN by upregulation of cell surface markers, cytokine \nproduction, cellular proliferation and activation of NF B. Our data show that the cellular \nresponse to CpG-ODN depended on a threshold level of expression of TLR9. TLR9 was \nwidely expressed amongst B cell tumours (with the exception of myeloma cell lines), but \nwe did not find either threshold levels of expression of TLR9 or responses to CpG-ODN \nin several myeloma or myeloid tumour cell lines or any non-haematological tumour cell \nlines tested in our study. TLR9-positive cells varied significantly in their responses to \nCpG-ODN, and the level of TLR9 expression beyond the threshold did not correlate with \nthe magnitude of the response to CpG-ODN. Finally, CpG-ODN induced NF B \nactivation and increased cellular proliferation in Hek293 cells that had been stably \ntransfected with hTLR9, but did not affect the expression of surface markers or synthesis \nof IL-6, IL-10 or TNF- . Thus both haematological and non-haematological cells \nexpressing appropriate levels of TLR9 respond to CpG-ODN, but the nature of the TLR9-\nmediated response is dependent on cell type.  \n \n \n \nKeywords: \nToll like receptor; TLR9; CpG-ODN; reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; \nNF B \n \n 3 \n \nIntroduction: \nThe immune system has developed defence mechanisms against infectious micro-\norganisms, based on the identification of pathogen associated molecular patterns \n(PAMPs). Crucial to mediating these effects is the family of toll like receptors (TLRs). Of \nthese, TLR9 detects differences in the chemical structure between microbial and host \nDNA, principally by recognising unmethylated deoxycytidyl deoxyguanosine \ndinucleotide (CpG) motifs in bacterial or viral DNA [1,2]. In humans, TLR9 is expressed \npredominantly in B-cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) [3-7]. However, studies \nhave reported human TLR9 (hTLR9) expression in other immune cells, such as activated \nneutrophils, natural killer cells, eosinophils and T lymphocytes [5, 8-10]. TLR9 \nexpression has also been reported in some non-immune human cell types, such as \npulmonary epithelium, keratinocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, and in lung and \nintestinal tumour cells [11-15].  \n \nLike the other microbial nucleic acid-sensing TLRs (TLR3, 7 and 8), TLR9 is expressed \nwithin the intracellular compartment. Prior to exposure to microbial DNA, TLR9 is \nretained within the endoplasmic reticulum [16]. Expression of the functional receptor \nrequires trafficking to endolysosomes, which is facilitated by the chaperone molecule \nUNC93B1 [17], and requires cleavage of the TLR9 ectodomain [18]. Whilst both full-\nlength and cleaved forms of TLR9 are able to bind microbial DNA, only the cleaved form \nis capable of recruiting MyD88 on activation [18], initiating the TLR signalling cascade. \n \nIdentifying the expression and function of TLR9 in immunological and non-\nimmunological cell types, including both normal and tumour cells, is central to \nunderstanding the range of biological effects mediated by TLR9, and the potential of \nCpG-ODN as immunotherapeutic agents. The aims of this work were to quantify TLR9 \nexpression in a panel of human tumour cells of haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic \norigin, and to correlate the levels of expression with responsiveness to stimulation with \nCpG-ODN. Using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method, we show that TLR9 mRNA was \nwidely expressed amongst B cell tumours (with the exception of myeloma cell lines), but \nwas weakly or not expressed in several myeloid tumour cell lines, nor in any non-\nhaematological tumour cell lines tested. We then studied the ability of the cells to \nupregulate the expression of several immunologically important cell surface markers \n 4 \n \n(CD54, CD80, CD86, MHC class II), to secrete cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF- ), \nand to increase cellular proliferation in response to the TLR9 ligand CpG-ODN. The \ncellular response to CpG-ODN depended on a threshold level of expression of TLR9, and \ncorrelated with activation of NFkB and increased cellular proliferation, but TLR9-\npositive cells varied significantly in other responses to CpG-ODN. \n \nMaterials and Methods: \nCells and cell lines used in the study. \nCells and cell lines used in the study are described in Table 1, and were maintained in \ngrowth medium (RPMI-1640 or Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium) supplemented \nwith 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), streptomycin (100\u03bcg\/ml), penicillin (100U\/ml), \nand 2mM L-glutamine (all from Sigma-Aldrich, UK), at 5% CO2, in a humid \nenvironment at 37\u00baC. Normal human peripheral blood B cells were isolated from \nmononuclear cells (PBMCs) from heparinised blood of volunteer healthy adult donors by \npositive selection, using 20\u03bcl of CD19+ magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bisley, \nUK) per 1x10\n7 total cells, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and were used as \npositive controls of TLR9 expression and function. Ex vivo B-CLL cells and mantle cell \nlymphoma cells (TH044 and FC029) were isolated in a similar way from the blood of \npatients with these conditions. Purity of the isolated B-cell populations was analysed by \nflow cytometry using anti-CD20 FITC (Beckman Coulter, UK), and was routinely greater \nthan 95%. Studies involving samples from patients had the approval of the Local \nResearch Ethics Committee. All of the other tumour cells used in the study were \nestablished cell lines generated from patients with a variety of haematological and non-\nhaematological malignancies.  \n \nTransfection of Hek293 cells with hTLR9. \nHuman embryonal kidney cell line, Hek293 (provided by Dr. Sek Chow, University of \nLeicester, UK), was transfected with two hTLR9-containing plasmids \n(pDisplay.HA\/TLR9 and pClneo.TLR9; the gift of Dr Cynthia Leifer, USA [19]), or with \nthe empty plasmids as controls, using Effectene gene transfection reagent (Qiagen, UK) \naccording to the manufacturer's instructions.\n \nBriefly, cells were plated in six-well plates \n(Nunclon\u2122 Surface, Nunc products, UK) at 5x105 cells\/well, and transfection was carried \nout on the\n \nfollowing day with 0.4\u03bcg\/well of the linearised plasmid, to yield cell lines \n 5 \n \nHek293.HA\/TLR9 and Hek293.TLR9 respectively. The cells were cultured for 24 hours \nat 37\u00baC and 5% CO2, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then transferred \nto growth medium containing 0.5mg\/ml G418 (Geneticin, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) for one to \ntwo weeks to select for stable transfectants, before freezing in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. \nTransfected cells were maintained in culture in 0.3mg\/ml G418 for a maximum of 5 \nweeks, before being replaced with freshly thawed cells. Expression of TLR9 mRNA was \ndetermined by RT-PCR for each batch used. \n \nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR for hTLR9 expression:  \nTotal cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen, UK) according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions, and cDNA was prepared by the Superscript\u2122 first strand \nsynthesis system (Invitrogen, UK), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. TLR9 \nmRNA expression was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using the LightCycler \nsystem (Roche\n \nDiagnostics, Mannheim). \u03b2-actin was used as a control PCR, and for \nnormalisation of TLR9 expression. The PCR were carried out using the following primer \ncombinations:  \nhTLR9-FW2 5'-ACAACAACATCCACAGCCAAGTGTC-3';  \nhTLR9-RW2 5'-AAGGCCAGGTAATTGTCACGGAG-3'  [20].  \n\u03b2-actin-FW 5'-GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCTC-3';  \n\u03b2-actin-RW 5'- CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-3'.  \nTLR9 primers yielded a PCR product of 250bp, while \u03b2-actin primers gave a 353bp \nproduct. All primers were obtained from MWG (MWG, Ebensburg, Germany). \nAmplification of cDNA was carried out in the presence of SYBR green (Quanti Tect \nSYPR\n\u00ae\n Green PCR Kit, Qiagen, UK). TLR9 and -actin PCR were run under the same \nconditions: 1.5 l of 5 M of each primer, 7.5 l of master mix SYBR Green I and 3.5 l of \nRNase free water were added to 1 l of the 5 g cDNA of a final volume of 15 l in \nLightCycler capillaries (20 l) (Roche\n \nDiagnostics, Mannheim). Thermal cycling was \ninitiated with an incubation step at 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by a first denaturation \nstep at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, and continued with 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 58\u00b0C \nfor 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 15 seconds. Melting curve analysis confirmed the specificity \nof the amplification products. Serial dilutions of standard preparations of hTLR9 DNA \n(pCl-neo.TLR9 plasmid) and -actin cDNA were included to permit standardisation of \n 6 \n \ndata between experiments, and the results were expressed in arbitrary units (AU), based \non the ratio of TLR9: -actin mRNA for each cell line.  \n \nCpG ODN activation dose and time course:\nType-B CpG-ODN 10103 was obtained from Coley Pharmaceutical, Canada. In \npreliminary experiments, 3 g\/ml CpG-ODN 10103 was found to be the optimal \nactivating dose for most cell lines, and was used throughout. Cells were either left \nuntreated (culture in growth medium alone) or stimulated with 3\u03bcg\/ml 10103 CpG-ODN \nin growth medium for variable times, depending on the experimental read-out.  \n \nEffect of CpG-ODN on surface marker expression: \nMonoclonal antibody (mAb) staining and flow cytometry were used to investigate the \neffect of CpG-ODN 10103 on the cellular expression of the adhesion molecule CD54, \ncostimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class II \n(MHC II). Cells (5x10\n5 \/ml) were stimulated with 3\u03bcg\/ml of 10103 CpG-ODN for three \ndays, or were left without activation, prior to staining with mAbs (10\u03bcl in each case), \nanti-CD54-PE, anti-CD80-FITC, anti-CD86-PE (Beckman Coulter, UK) and anti-MHC \nII-FITC (Dako, UK). IgG1-PE and IgG1-FITC mAbs (Beckman Coulter, UK) were used \nas isotype controls. Analysis was carried out using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and \nCell Quest Pro software (Becton-Dickinson Ltd, UK). Data from 10,000 gated events \nwere analysed, and are expressed as mean channel fluorescence intensity (MFI). \n \nEffect of CpG-ODN on the ability of cells to stimulate in allogeneic MLR: \nStimulation of allogeneic T cell proliferation in vitro was estimated in mixed lymphocyte \nreactions (MLR). Responder peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy \nvolunteer donors were obtained by Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield, UK) separation of \nheparinised venous blood. The experiment was carried out using 2 different healthy \ndonors, with consistent results. Stimulator cells were either treated with CpG-ODN \n(3 g\/ml) or left untreated, prior to being treated with 0.5ml of Mitomycin C (Mit-C; 100 \ng\/ml) for 1 hour, washed twice with RPMI 1640, and plated in 96 well U-bottomed \nplates in triplicate wells at 10\n5\n cells per well in 100 l culture medium (RPMI 1640 plus \n10% FCS and antibiotics). To these cells, 100 l of allogeneic responder cells (normal \nPBMC) were added at 10\n6\n cells\/ml. The background controls were responder cells \n 7 \n \ncultured alone, and Mit-C treated stimulator cells alone. The cell cultures were incubated \nat 37\n0\nC in 5% CO2 for 5 days. On the fifth day, wells were pulsed with 1 Ci\/well \n[methyl \n3\nH]-thymidine (GE Healthcare, UK) for 16-18 hours. The cells were harvested \nonto glass fibre filters (1450-421, Wallac, Finland) using a Tomtec cell harvester (Wallac, \nFinland). After drying, the filters were sealed in sample bags with liquid scintillation \nBetaplate Scint (Perkin Elmer, UK), and the incorporation of [\n3\nH] thymidine into cellular \nDNA was measured on a 1450 Microbeta plus liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, \nFinland).  \n \nEffect of CpG-ODN on production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF- : \nThe secretion of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 by resting and CpG-ODN-activated cells \nwas analysed using multiplexed bead immunoassays (Upstate Biotechnology, Abingdon, \nUK). Five x10\n5\n cells\/ml of non-adherent cells, or 1x10\n5\n cells\/ml of adherent cell lines, \nwere split into triplicate wells in 96 well flat-bottomed microtitre plates, and left to grow \neither without or with 3 g\/ml 10103 CpG-ODN for 36 hours, before cell-free \nsupernatants were harvested and frozen in aliquots at -80\no\nC until assayed. Culture \nsupernatants were assayed as previously described [21], using a Luminex100 machine \n(Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) and StarStation software (Applied Cytometry \nSystems, Sheffield, UK). Data are expressed as cytokine concentration (pg\/ml).  \n \nEffect of CpG-ODN on cellular proliferation: \nCellular proliferation was estimated by incorporation of [methyl-\n3\nH] thymidine into \nreplicating cellular DNA. One x10\n5 \ncells\/well were left to grow in triplicate wells for \nthree days in flat bottom 96 well plates in the presence or absence of 3\u03bcg\/ml 10103 CpG-\nODN, and then pulsed with [methyl-\n3\nH] thymidine (1\u03bcCi\/well; GE Healthcare, UK) for \nthe next 16-18 hours. The cells were harvested onto glass fibre filters (1450-421, Wallac, \nFinland) using a Tomtec cell harvester (Wallac, Finland). After drying, the filters were \nsealed in sample bags with liquid scintillation Betaplate Scint (Perkin Elmer, UK), and \nthe incorporation of [\n3\nH] thymidine in cellular DNA was measured on a 1450 Microbeta \nplus liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland).  \n \nEffect of CpG-ODN on NF B activation: \nNuclear factor kappa B luciferase assay: In order to demonstrate TLR9-mediated nuclear \nfactor kappa B (NF B) activation, 5x10\n5\n cells\/ml for adherent cells or 5x10\n6\n cells\/ml for \n 8 \n \nsuspension cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid, \n(3xNF\u03baB.luc; the gift of Prof. L Ziegler-Heitbrock, University of Leicester, UK), which \ncontained three copies of the NF\u03baB binding sequence from the mouse kappa light-chain \nenhancer cloned upstream of the TATA box of the p\u03b2TATA luci reporter plasmid.  \nTransient transfection was carried out using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, \nUK), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 0.4\u03bcg\/well of 3xNF\u03baB.luc \nconstruct. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were washed and split into two \ngroups, each in three wells in 24 well plates (1ml\/well in fresh growth medium). One \ngroup of cells was left untreated, and the other group was activated with 3\u03bcg\/ml 10103 \nCpG-ODN for 18 hours. Control groups of non-transfected cells were treated in the same \nway. Afterward, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and the pellet was dissolved in \n150\u03bcl of 1x reporter lysis buffer (Promega, UK). Twenty microliters of lysate was used \nfor assay with 100\u03bcl of luciferase assay system (Promega, UK). The luciferase activity \nwas measured using a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Germany). \nProtein concentration was measured using Lowry method for each lysate, and was used to \nnormalize the data. \nI B-  western blot: Five x10\n6 \ncells\/ml were either activated for various times (up to 120 \nminutes) with 10103 CpG-ODN (3\u03bcg\/ml), or were left unactivated. For each time point, \ncells were lysed on ice using 0.5ml RIPA lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% Nadeoxycholate, \n50mM Tris HCl, 150mM NaCl, 1mM Na-fluoride, 30mM Na-pyrophosphate, 2mM \nEDTA, 0.1% SDS, 100 M Na-orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethanusulphonylfluoride \n(PMSF) and protease inhibitors (Sigma) of 10 g\/ml Leupeptin, 10 g\/ml Aprotinin and \n10 g\/ml Pepstatin). After lysis, the samples were centrifuged at high speed (14,000 rpm) \nfor 10 minutes at 4\u00baC, and the supernatants were dried using a bench-top freeze dryer \n(ModulyoD Freeze Dryer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK). The lyophilized supernatant \nwas dissolved in 50\u03bcl of the lysis buffer. Protein concentration was estimated using a \nmicroplate assay (BioRad, Hercules, USA). Twenty micrograms of protein lysate was \nresuspended in 20 \u03bcl Laemmli loading dye with -ME (BioRad, Hercules, USA) and \nboiled for 5 minutes at 95\u00baC, prior to SDS-PAGE to fractionate the proteins. Afterwards \nthe proteins were transferred into a Hybond-C Super nitrocellulose membrane \n(Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). The membrane blots were washed in 1x \nPBS \u2013 0.1% Tween 20 three times for 5 minutes on an orbital shaker, blocked with 5% \nnon-fat dry milk for 1 hour, washed again, and then blotted with 1:500 rabbit polyclonal \n 9 \n \nanti-phosphor-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (Ser 32)-R (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, USA) in 1% \nnon-fat dry milk for 24-48 hours. The membranes were then washed and stained with \nperoxidase labelled polyclonal swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins\/HRP (Dako \nCytomation, UK), 1:1000 dilution in 4% non-fat dry milk. Membranes were washed, and \nthe protein bands were visualized by Chemiluminescence ECL Blotting detection kit and \nexposed to Hyperfilm\u2122 ECL Western (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). \nThe membranes were stripped and reblotted for total I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein using rabbit \npolyclonal IgG anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (C-21; sc-371 Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, USA), \nfollowed by 1:1000 peroxidase labelled polyclonal swine anti-rabbit \nimmunoglobulins\/HRP (Dako Cytomation, UK). To ensure equal protein loading, the \nsame membranes were stained using -actin\/HRP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, \nSanta Cruz, USA) at 1:5,000 dilution, before detection using ECL. Band intensities were \nquantified using a GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad, UK). The relative intensities of \nphosphorylated and total I\u03baB-\u03b1 bands were normalised against actin. \n \nStatistical Analysis: \nData were analysed using Student\u2019s paired t-test using GraphPad prism 4 software version \n4.03. Results were considered significant when p value was less than 0.05, and highly \nsignificant when p value was less than 0.01. \n \nResults: \nTLR9 expression in human cell lines by semi-quantitative RT-PCR: \nWe used a semi-quantitative RT-PCR to determine the level of TLR9 mRNA in each cell \nline, and normalised levels of hTLR9 mRNA against expression of the house keeping \ngene \u03b2-actin. The data are expressed in arbitrary units, as the ratio of TLR9: -actin \nmRNA (Table 1). Peripheral blood B-cells from normal healthy donors (included as a \npositive control for TLR9 expression) expressed TLR9 at a relatively high level. TLR9 \nmRNA expression levels in a panel of B cell-derived tumour cells was variable, but \nshowed a TLR9: -actin ratio > 1.0 x10\n-2\n AU in all cells except for the myeloma cell lines \nU266 and Karpas707H. The myeloid lineage cell lines, KG-1 and HL-60 were also \nnegative by this criterion (TLR9: -actin ratio <1.0 x10\n-2\n AU), whilst the monocytic cell \nline U937 expressed a level of TLR9 mRNA above this threshold. All of a panel of non-\nhaematological cell lines showed low TLR9 expression (TLR9: -actin < 1.0 x10\n-2\n AU). \n 10 \n \nUntransfected or mock-transfected Hek293 cells had very low TLR9 expression, whilst \nHek293 cells which had been stably transfected with TLR9-containing plasmids \n(Hek293.TLR9 or Hek293.HA\/TLR9) expressed TLR9 at levels comparable to the \nmajority of B cell lines tested (TLR9: -actin > 1.0 x10\n-2\n AU; Table 1). Based on these \ndata, we used an arbitrary cut-off level of >1.0 x10\n-2\n AU to define cells as TLR9-positive, \nor TLR9-negative (<1.0 x10\n-2\n AU). \n \nCpG-ODN mediated responses of the tumour cell lines: \nHaving established the levels of TLR9 expression, we investigated the effect of the TLR9 \nagonist, 10103 CpG-ODN, on the cells, by surface marker expression, cytokine release, \ncellular proliferation, and NF B activation.  \nCpG-ODN mediated surface marker upregulation: Flow cytometry was used to estimate \nexpression of CD54, CD80, CD86 and MHC II by the cells, in the absence or presence of \nCpG-ODN. As shown in Table 2, CpG-ODN induced upregulation of all four surface \nmarkers in normal human B cells. Of nine TLR9-positive tumour B cells tested, six \nshowed upregulation of three or all four cell surface markers, whilst the remaining three \nshowed upregulation of at least one of the cell markers in response to CpG-ODN. In \ncontrast, the TLR9-negative haematological tumour cells, U266, Karpas 707H, KG-1 and \nHL60, and all of six TLR9-negative non-haematological cell lines, failed to upregulate \nany of the tested surface markers in response to treatment with CpG-ODN (Table 2). \nSimilarly, mock-transfected Hek293 cells, and Hek293 cells that had been stably \ntransfected with hTLR9 did not upregulate the surface markers in response to treatment \nwith CpG-ODN. \nEffect of CpG-ODN on the ability of cells to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation in \nMLR: As CpG-ODN induced the upregulation of the major T cell costimulatory ligand \nmolecules, CD80 and CD86, in several of the TLR9-positive cell lines, we investigated \nthe effect of CpG-ODN on the ability of the cells to stimulate T cell proliferative \nresponses in allogeneic MLR. The highly immunogenic EBV-lymphoblastoid cell line \nHMy2 was used as a positive control for allogeneic T cell stimulation in the MLR, and \ninduced stronger T cell proliferation than any of the cell lines tested. As illustrated in \nFigure 1, only the normal B cells (CD19+) and the myeloma cell line RPMI 8226 induced \nan enhanced stimulation of allogeneic T cells following treatment with CpG-ODN. Both \n 11 \n \nof these cell lines showed upregulation of CD80 and CD86 in response to CpG-ODN. \nHowever, TLR9-positive B-CLL cells (which also upregulated CD80 and CD86), and \nRamos cells (which upregulated CD86 but not CD80), did not show a significant increase \nin induction of T cell proliferation in allogeneic MLR following treatment with CpG-\nODN. The TLR9-negative cell lines U266 and Karpas 707H, and all of five non-\nhaematological cell lines, also failed to induce enhanced T cell proliferation following \ntreatment with CpG-ODN. \nEffect of CpG-ODN on the induction of cytokines: To study the role of TLR9 in cytokine \nproduction, we investigated the effect of CpG-ODN on the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, \nIL-8 and IL-10 by the tumour cell lines. The results for IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-  are shown \nin Table 3. Normal human B cells, and five of seven tumour cell lines of haematological \norigin that constitutively expressed hTLR9 at > 1.0 x10\n-2\n AU, responded to treatment \nwith CpG-ODN by significantly increasing secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- , whilst \nthe remaining two TLR9-positive haematological tumour cells (Ramos and RPMI) \nincreased expression of at least one of these cytokines. In contrast, the TLR9-negative \nhaematological cell lines, KG-1, U266 and Karpas707H, did not increase cytokine \nsecretion in response to CpG-ODN. None of the non-haematological tumour cell lines, \nincluding Hek293 cells that had been stably transfected with hTLR9, produced a \nsignificant cytokine response to treatment with CpG-ODN (Table 3). We also tested the \neffect of CpG-ODN treatment on IL-8 production in five of the non-haematological \ntumour cell lines (and in normal human B cells as controls), as several groups have \nreported IL-8 production by epithelial cells in response to CpG-ODN [11-13]. Normal \nhuman B cells showed a slight (3-fold) increase in IL-8 secretion in response to CpG-\nODN, whilst none of the non-haematological tumour cells tested (HeLa, DU-145, HRT-\n18, MCF-7, and WM1361A) showed a significant upregulation of IL-8 secretion in \nresponse to CpG-ODN (data not presented). \n \nCpG-ODN mediated cellular proliferation: Normal human B cells, and TLR9-positive \ntumour cells B-CLL, TH044, Ramos, Raji, BJAB and RPMI, all showed a significant \nincrease in cellular proliferation in response to treatment with CpG-ODN (Table 4). The \nTLR9-negative haematological tumour cells KG-1, Karpas707H and U266, and the non-\nhaematological tumour cell lines, MCF-7, DU-145, HRT-18, WM1361A, Hek293 and \nHeLa, did not show any changes in the cellular proliferation (Table 4). In contrast to the \n 12 \n \ndata on cell surface marker upregulation and cytokine production, CpG-ODN stimulation \nof TLR9-transfected Hek293 cells resulted in a significant increase in cellular \nproliferation of both Hek293.TLR9 and Hek293.HA\/TLR9 cell lines, whilst mock \ntransfected Hek293 cells did not show any change in cellular proliferation in response to \nCpG-ODN (Table 4). \n \nEffect of CpG-ODN on NF B activation: To investigate the effects of CpG-ODN \nactivation of TLR9 on activation of the NF B pathway, we used a NF B-luciferase assay. \nCpG-ODN treatment was associated with a significant increase in NF B-luciferase \nactivity in normal human B cells, and in all of three constitutively TLR9-positive tumour \nB cell lines tested (B-CLL, BJAB and RPMI), but had no effect on luciferase activity in \nthe TLR9-negative cell lines, Hek293 and HeLa (Table 5). Mock transfected (pCl-neo or \npDisplay) Hek293 cells did not show any NF B activation in response to CpG-ODN, \nwhereas NFkB activation was observed in both of the TLR9-transfected (Hek293.TLR9 \nand Hek293.HA\/TLR9) cell lines. Activation of NF B by CpG-ODN was confirmed in \nHek293.HA\/TLR9 cells by western blotting for phosphor- and total-I B-  (Figure 2). \nInduction of phosphor-I B-  was also seen following CpG-ODN treatment of TLR9-\npositive Ramos cells, albeit with different kinetics, but no induction of phophor-  \nwas seen in Hek 293 cells transfected with the control plasmid, pDisplay (Figure 2). \nThese data confirm that TLR9 expression was both required and responsible for CpG-\nODN-mediated activation of NF B in these cell lines. \n \nDiscussion \nKnowing the expression and function of TLR9 in human normal and tumour cells is \ncrucial for understanding the role of TLR9 in infections, and the potential of CpG-ODN \nin immunotherapy. In humans, TLR9 is expressed mainly in B-cells and pDCs [3-7], but \nhas also been reported as being expressed in activated neutrophils [8], natural killer (NK) \ncells [5,10], eosinophils [9], and T lymphocytes [5], in some non-immune cell types, such \nas pulmonary epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, intestinal \nepithelial cells [11-14], and in solid tumours such as lung and intestinal cancers [11,15]. \nThese data suggest that hTLR9 may be more widely expressed than was initially \nappreciated, and have implications for the use of TLR9 agonists in immunotherapy.  \n \n 13 \n \nTo address this, we studied the expression of TLR9 in more than 20 cells and cell lines of \nboth haematological and non-haematological origin, using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR \nmethod. We then correlated the results with the ability of the cells to respond to \nstimulation with the TLR9 agonist, CpG-ODN, using a range of functional parameters, \nincluding the upregulation of cell surface marker expression, secretion of cytokines, \nincrease in cellular proliferation, and activaton of NFkB. Our data indicated that cells \nwith a level of expression of TLR9 mRNA > 1.0 x10\n-2\n AU responded to treatment with \nCpG-ODN, whilst we did not detect any responses to CpG-ODN in cells that expressed < \n1.0 x10\n-2\n AU TLR9 mRNA.  \n \nTLR9 was expressed above the threshold level in normal human B cells and in the \nmajority of tumour B cells and cell lines tested, with the exception of the myeloma cell \nlines U266 and Karpas707H. The myeloid leukaemia cell lines KG-1 and HL-60 also \nshowed sub-threshold levels of hTLR9 expression, although the monocytic cell line U937 \nwas TLR9-positive. These results are broadly consistent with previous publications in \nhuman cells and cell lines of haematological origin [1, 5, 20, 22, 23]. None of the \nepithelial or melanoma cell lines tested in our study expressed a threshold level or TLR9. \nIn this respect, our data differ from several previous studies, which reported TLR9 \nexpression in a variety of epithelial cells and cell lines [11-15]. These differences may be \ndue to the different cell lines studied, or to different criteria used in interpreting qPCR \ndata on TLR9 expression by the different cell lines.  \n \nWhilst qPCR provides a sensitive method for the detection and quantitation of TLR9 \nmRNA, it does not provide information on TLR9 protein expression in the cells. We were \nunable to generate quantitative assays for TLR9 protein expression by flow cytometry, \nwestern blotting or immunoprecipitation, using commercially available monoclonal and \npolyclonal antibodies to human TLR9 (data not shown). This may be due to limitations of \nantigen recognition or antibody avidity, low levels of protein expression, or a \ncombination of these factors. However, confocal microscopy using the same antibodies \nand an indirect staining method (data not shown), gave data that were broadly consistent \nwith RT-PCR results, suggesting that antibody specificity was not the problem. \n \n \n 14 \n \nHaving established the levels of TLR9 expression in the panel of haematological and non-\nhaematological cell lines, we investigated their responses to the TLR9 agonist CpG-ODN. \nBased on previous reports, we studied the effects of CpG-ODN 10103 on expression of \ncell surface markers (CD54, CD80, CD86 and MHC class II), cytokine production (IL-6, \nIL-8, IL-10 and TNF- ), cellular proliferation, and NF B activation. Several authors have \nreported CpG-ODN-induced upregulation of CD54, CD80, CD86 and MHC class II \n(amongst other markers), as well as enhanced cellular proliferation in human normal and \ntumour B cells [22, 24-26]. Production of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-  was reported by CpG-\nODN stimulated B cells, whilst CpG-ODN-responsive epithelial cells have been reported \nto secrete IL-6, IL-8 and \/ or TNF-  [12, 13, 24, 26-28]. Finally, activation of NF B is \ncentral to TLR9-mediated cellular signalling and control of gene transcription [29], and \nshould therefore represent a universal indicator of TLR9 signalling.  By using a \ncombination of these functional parameters, we aimed to identify all the CpG-ODN-\nresponsive cells in our study.  \n \nIn all of the haematological cell lines tested that constitutively expressed TLR9 (> 1.0 \nx10\n-2\n AU), CpG-ODN induced increased cellular proliferation, upregulation of at least \none of the cell surface markers and increased secretion of at least one of the cytokines \ntested. However, the TLR9-positive cell lines varied in both the range and magnitude of \nthese responses. As several of the cell lines showed upregulation of key molecules \ninvolved in antigen presentation to T cells, we studied the effect of CpG-ODN treatment \nof the cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in allogeneic MLR. We observed relatively \nweak increases in T cell stimulation by CpG-ODN-treated cells, compared with untreated \ncells, only with normal B cells and RPMI 8226 cells, amongst the TLR9-positive cell \nlines. Consistent with this, we have found that CpG-ODN treatment appears to be much \nless potent than CD40 ligation in enhancing the antigen presenting capacity of normal and \ntumour B cells (Abdulmajed, unpublished data). \n \nIn contrast to the TLR9-positive cells, CpG-ODN had no effect on cellular proliferation, \nsurface marker expression or cytokine production in TLR9-negative (< 1.0 x10\n-2\n AU) \nhaematological or non-haematological cell lines. Other pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as \ninterferon- , have been shown to upregulate expression of CD54 and MHC class II on \nboth epithelial and melanoma cell lines [30-34], and data on TLR9-mediated responses in \n 15 \n \nother epithelial cells have described release of IL-6, IL-8 and\/or TNF-  in response to \nCpG-ODN [11-13; 27, 28]. We would therefore have expected to see similar responses to \nCpG-ODN had the cell lines been TLR9-positive. To address this, Hek293 cells were \nstably transfected with two hTLR9 expressing plasmids. Both Hek293 cell lines \ntransfected with hTLR9 expressed TLR9 (> 1.0 x10\n-2\n AU), but did not upregulate any of \nthe cell surface markers or cytokines tested in response to CpG-ODN. However, these \ncells showed a significant increase in cellular proliferation, and activation of NF B, in \nresponse to CpG-ODN. These results indicate that CpG-ODN mediated activation of \nNF B is TLR9 dependent, and enhances cellular proliferation [35], but that cell surface \nmarker upregulation or cytokine production may be independent of NF B. This is \nconsistent with the finding that the NF B inhibitor, curcumin, blocked the effects of \nCpG-ODN on cellular proliferation in TLR9-positive BJAB cells, but had little effect on \nCpG-ODN-mediated cytokine production or cell surface marker upregulation (Assaf, \nunpublished data). The results also confirm that TLR9 can mediate cellular responses in \nnon-haematological cells, if expressed at appropriate levels, but suggest that the nature of \nthe responses varies between cells of different origins, such as marrow-derived or \nepithelial cells. Thus, the lack of induction of surface marker or cytokine expression in \nthe non-haematological tumour cell lines may reflect cell type-specific differences in \nresponse to CpG-ODN. However, the absence of cellular proliferation in the epithelial \nand melanoma cell lines most likely reflects the lack of TLR9 expression in these cells, as \nall cell lines tested that expressed the threshold level of TLR9 expression (including the \ntransfected Hek293 cells) showed a significant increase in cellular proliferation in \nresponse to CpG-ODN.  \n \nIn summary, our experiments have shown a correlation between a threshold level of \ncellular TLR9 mRNA expression in both haematological and non-haematological cells, \nand the ability of the cells to respond to the TLR9 agonist, CpG-ODN. This response \ninvolved the NF B intracellular signalling pathway, but the downstream effects on \ncytokine synthesis and cell surface marker expression appeared to be cell type-specific, \nand varied between different cell lines. Thus the effects of CpG-ODN will depend not \nonly on the expression of TLR9 by cells, but also on the cell type(s) involved. These \nresults may have important implications for the role of TLR9 in protective immunity at \ndifferent tissue sites, and on the use of CpG-ODN in immunotherapy. \n 16 \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n1.
