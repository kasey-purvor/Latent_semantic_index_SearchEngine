The size of the resulting periodic domains cannot be predicted with weakly\nnonlinear methods. We show that what determine this size are exponentially small (but exponen-\ntially growing in space) terms. These can only be computed by going beyond all orders of the usual\nmultiple-scale expansion. We apply the method to the Swift-Hohenberg equation and derive ana-\nlytically a snaking bifurcation curve. At each fold of this bifurcation curve, a new pair of peaks is\nadded to the periodic domain, which can thus be seen as a bound state of localized structures. Such\nscenarios have been reported with optical localized structures in nonlinear cavities and localized\nbuckling.\nIn spatially extended dynamical systems featuring sub-\ncritical Turing instabilities, there generally exists a pa-\nrameter value in the vicinity of which stable stationary\nfronts separate regions in space where the solution is ei-\nther uniform or spatially oscillating. Owing to the wide\nvariety of patterns that can result, this so-called Maxwell\npoint has received much attention. Examples of appli-\ncations are found in hydrodynamic [1], mechanical [2],\nvegetation [3] or nonlinear optical problems [4, 5]. A\nparticularly dramatic feature associated to this situation\nis a snaking bifurcation diagram that is composed of an\ninfinite succession of folds [2, 5]. Each fold signals the\nappearance of a new pair of peaks in the patterned do-\nmain, so that the latter can be viewed as a bound state\nof localized structures [6]. Moreover, this curve delim-\nits the \u201cpinning range\u201d of parameters where localized\nstructures can be found, which is a useful piece of in-\nformation if these are to be used for data processing [7].\nThe phenomenon is robust and has been given a geo-\nmetrical interpretation in the frame of dynamical system\ntheory [8, 9]. However a key question that has remained\nunanswered so far is: what determines the size of the\npatterned state, or equivalently, how to construct such a\nbifurcation curve. A crucial observation in this respect\nis that the standard multiple-scale analysis, which sepa-\nrates the slow spatial scale of the front from that of the\nfast-oscillating underlying pattern, is insufficient to re-\nsolve this problem [1]. Indeed, this procedure misses the\nexponentially small \u201cnon-adiabatic\u201d effects that couple\nthe slow and fast scales. In an attempt to compensate\nfor this shortcoming, several authors have modified the\nmultiple-scale analysis and did obtain some exponentially\nsmall terms [10, 11]. Although some insight can be gained\nthis way, their method is inconsistent in that the enve-\nlope, which is supposed to depend only on the slow scale,\nis proposed to satisfy an equation where the fast scale ap-\npears explicitly. This introduces the non-adiabatic effects\nafter a few orders, whereas in fact they appear beyond\nall orders of the multiple-scale analysis.\nThe purpose of this letter is to show how to compute\nthese effects and to demonstrate their physical relevance\nby constructing the snaking bifurcation diagram. We\nnote that beyond-all-order techniques have been applied\nin a few instances to multiple-scale problems: gravity-\ncapillary solitary waves [12], oscillating shock solutions\nof the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation [13, 14] and strut\nbuckling on an elastic foundation [15]. The last analysis\nis close in spirit to the present one but breaks down near\nthe Maxwell point. Let us also mention the recent alter-\nnative approach combining asymptotic and geometrical\narguments in [16], which was successfully applied to a\nsnaking bifurcation curve involving a saddle-point and a\nfocus in phase space.\nPresently, we analyze the Swift-Hohenberg equation\n\u2202E\n\u2202t\n= Y + CE \u2212 E3 \u2212 (1 + \u22022x)2E, (1)\nrelevant to the study of many pattern-forming systems\n[17]. For example, in nascent optical bistability, E, Y,\nand C respectively denote deviations of the cavity field\namplitude, the injected field amplitude, and the cooper-\nativity parameter from the onset of bistability [4]. The\nunit length is set by the cavity detuning and the diffrac-\ntion coefficient.\nThe homogeneous steady state Ehg satisfies Y = E3hg+\nEhg \u2212 CEhg and there is a subcritical Turing bifurcation\nwith unit wave number when 3E2hg = C. In the following,\ninstead of Y and C, we will use the equivalent set of\nparameters Ehg and \u03b5\u00bf 1 defined through\nC = 3E2hg \u2212 \u03b54, E (x, t) = Ehg + \u03b5f (x) .\nHence, \u03b5 sets the order of magnitude of the oscillation at\nthe Maxwell point. The scaling above is typical for stable\nbranches of periodic pattern emerging from a subcritical\nbifurcation [17]. With this change of variable, the Swift-\nHohenberg equation becomes(\n1 + \u22022x\n)2\nf + \u03b54f + 3\u03b5Ehgf2 + \u03b52f3 = 0. (2)\n2We want to study (2) for values of Ehg such that ho-\nmogeneous and periodic solutions can be separated by\nstable stationary fronts. To this end, we introduce the\nslow scale X = \u03b52x and look for a solution of the form\nf (x) =\nN\u2211\nn=0\n\u03b5nfn (x,X) + \u03b4f (x,X, \u03b5) , (3)\nEhg = E0 + \u03b52E2 + \u03b54E4 + . . .+ \u03b4E. (4)\nThe power series in (3) being generally divergent, it is\ntruncated after N terms and we denote the remainder by\n\u03b4f . On the other hand, the power series in (4) approxi-\nmates the Maxwell point, while \u03b4E is a small deviation\nfrom it. Substituting (3) and (4) in (2), one obtains a\nset of linear differential problems at each order in \u03b5, of\nwhich the first few are solved in the usual way: first, set-\nting \u03b5 = 0, f0 is seen to be a harmonic function of x with\nperiod 2pi and slow-varying complex amplitude, denoted\nby f0,1(X). Secondly, a solvability condition at O\n(\n\u03b52\n)\nis\nthat E0 =\n\u221a\n3\/38. Finally, at O\n(\n\u03b54\n)\n, a new solvability\ncondition yields the amplitude equation\nf \u2032\u20320,1+\n4i |f0,1|2\n19\nf \u20320,1 = f0,1(\n1\n4\n\u2212\n\u221a\n57\n2\nE2 |f0,1|2+2205361 |f0,1|\n4)\n(5)\nfor f0,1 (X). This amplitude equation is found to have\nfront solutions for E2 =\n\u221a\n5872\/20577 \u2248 0.534 and\nhence, adopting this value, the leading order solution is\nf0 (x\u00af,X) =\n\u221a\n19\u03b2\/2\neX\/2\n(1 + eX)1\/2+i\u03b2\/2\neix\u00af + c.c., (6)\nwhere \u03b2 = 1\/\n\u221a\n734, x\u00af = x+\u03d5, and c.c. means \u201ccomplex\nconjugate\u201d. In this expression, \u03d5 denotes the phase of\nthe fast oscillations relative to the slow scale and is un-\nknown at this stage. This solution describes the onset of\noscillation but doesn\u2019t predict return to the homogenous\nstate as X \u2192 \u221e. One could expect to find this piece\nof information by computing higher order terms in (3)\nand introducing slower space scales. However, no matter\nhow far one proceeds in this way, no sign of the ampli-\ntude of oscillation going back to zero for large X ever\nshows up. This means that the terms responsible for this\ndown-switching lie beyond all orders of the multiple-scale\nexpansion.\nIn (3) the magnitude of the terms \u03b5nfn first decreases\nwith n but eventually increases, thus making the series\ndivergent. In order to capture exponentially small terms,\nwe truncate the sum in (3) near its smallest term and\ncompute the remainder \u03b4f . Indeed, it is expected that,\nfor large n, the magnitude of fn will be given roughly by\n\u0393 (n\/2 + \u03b1+ 1) for some constant \u03b1 [18]. Hence, using\nStirling\u2019s formula, \u03b5nfn = O\n(\n\u03b5n (n\/2)n\/2+\u03b1+1\/2 e\u2212n\/2\n)\nand the least term, obtained for N\/2 \u2248 \u03b5\u22122, is thus\nO\n(\n\u03b5\u22122\u03b1\u22121e\u22121\/\u03b5\n2\n)\n. This makes the magnitude of the re-\nmainder in (3) of the right order to study non-adiabatic\neffects. Recently, there has been considerable progress\nin the mathematical literature on the optimal choice of\nnormal-form truncation [19].\nAssuming then that we have determined f0, f1,. . . fN ,\nthe equation for the remainder is(\n1 +\n(\n\u2202x + \u03b52\u2202X\n)2)2\n\u03b4f + \u03b54\u03b4f + 6\u03b5 (E0 + . . .)\n\u00d7 (f0 + \u03b5f1 + . . .) \u03b4f + 3\u03b52\n(\nf20 + . . .\n)\n\u03b4f\n= \u22123\u03b5\u03b4E (f20 + 2\u03b5f0f1 + . . .)+ rhsN . (7)\nSince \u03b4f is exponentially small, one can safely neglect\nall nonlinear terms in \u03b4f in (7). The right hand side is\nsplit into two parts. The first one is due to the deviation\nfrom the Maxwell point and can again be treated by the\nmultiple-scale method. This produces the contribution\n\u03b4fE in \u03b4f , given by\ni`1\u03b5\n\u22122\u03b4Ee3X\/2eix\u00af\n(1 + eX)3\/2+i\u03b2\/2\n[\neX (\u03b2 + i) + \u03b2 + 2i+ e.d.t.\n]\n+ c.c.,\n(8)\nwhere `1 =\n\u221a\n114 (19\u03b2\/8)3\/2 and \u201ce.d.t.\u201d stands for ex-\nponentially decaying terms as X \u2192 \u221e. On the other\nhand, rhsN is the remainder obtained after substituting\nthe truncated multiple-scales expansion for f into the\nequation. It depends on the large-n terms of this ex-\npansion, and its determination makes up the majority\nof the effort behind this work. Here we only sketch the\ncalculation.\nLet us first observe that the leading order solution (6)\nhas the two simple poles X = \u00b1ipi. Such singularities are\nknown since [20] to be intimately related to the existence\nof exponentially small terms in f . More specifically, these\nterms will be shown to emerge from a Stokes line that\njoins the two singularities.\nOne can decompose the nth term in (3) as\u2211\nfn,k (X) exp ikx\u00af, with k = \u2212n \u2212 1, . . . , n + 1. Equa-\ntion (2) then yields a recurrent set of equations for the\nfunctions fn,k(X), which can be set up as an eigenvalue\nproblem in the limit as n \u2192 \u221e. In the present case, it\nquickly emerges that only harmonics for which n + k is\nodd are nonzero. For given n\u00c0 1, n odd, the eigenvector\nthat is relevant to our discussion is then found to be(\nfn,0\nfn,2\n)\n= `2\n\u03ban\u0393\n(\nn\n2 + \u03b1+ 1\n)\n(ipi \u2212X)n\/2+\u03b1+1\n(\nF0 (X) +O (1\/n)\nF2 (X) +O (1\/n)\n)\n,\n(9)\nall other components fn,k with the same n being at least\nO (1\/\n\u221a\nn) smaller. In this expression, \u03ba =\n\u221a\ni is the as-\nsociated eigenvalue, \u03b1 = 2 + i\u03b2\/2, `2 is a constant, and\nF1\u00b11 (X) =\ne3X\/2\n(1 + eX)3\/2\u00b1i\u03b2\/2\n[\n6 + eX \u00b1 i\u03b2\n\u00d7 (4\u2212 4X + 4ipi \u2212 eX)+ e.d.t.] . (10)\nThis was derived using 1\/\n\u221a\nn as a small parameter in\nthe recurrence equations. The value of `2 can only be\n3determined numerically, either by solving the recurrence\nequations exactly all the way up to large values of n, or by\nsolving (2) numerically for an appropriate set of parame-\nter values. Let us remark that (9) does not represent the\nfull solution {fn,k} for large n. In particular, there is an-\nother eigenvector, associated to \u03ba =\n\u221a\u2212i, and for which\nthe dominant elements are fn,0 and fn,\u22122. However, its\ncontribution to rhsN will not affect our result at leading\norder, so we will simply ignore it in the present discus-\nsion. We also draw attention to the special role played by\nX = ipi in (9). Actually, there is a complementary set of\neigenvectors associated to X = \u2212ipi such that fn(x,X)\nis real for real values of X. These will be taken into ac-\ncount at the end of this development by requiring that\nthe remainder \u03b4f be real as well.\nUsing (9), we now compute rhsN in the vicinity of the\nStokes line, which joins X = ipi and X = \u2212ipi. To this\nend, we setX = ipi\u2212ir exp i\u03b5\u03b8 with r fixed between 0 and\n2pi and \u03b8 variable. The latter corresponds to the Stokes\nvariable in Berry\u2019s treatment of Stokes\u2019s discontinuities\n[18]. With this parameterization, X is on the Stokes line\nwhen \u03b8 = 0. The large-n terms of {fn,k} are then found\nto produce\n4i`2\u03b5\u03b8\n(\nF0 + F2e2ix\u00af\n) (\u03b5\u03ba)N+2 \u0393 (N\/2 + \u03b1+ 2)\n(ipi \u2212X)N\/2+\u03b1+2\n(11)\nin rhsN and the key observation [14] is that, at optimal\ntruncation, where N\/2+\u03b1+1 \u2248 r\/\u03b52, the fraction above\nis asymptotic to\ni\n\u221a\n2pi\nr\n\u03b5\u22125 exp\n(\n\u03b2pi\n4\n\u2212 i\u03b2 ln \u03b5\u2212 pi\n\u03b52\n\u2212 r\u03b8\n2\n2\n\u2212 iX\n\u03b52\n)\n. (12)\nThis means that the fraction in (11) is locally equivalent\nto the fast oscillating factor exp\n(\u2212iX\/\u03b52) = exp (\u2212ix)\nand this turns rhsN into a resonant driving term in (7).\nThis is only true very close to the Stokes line, as attested\nby the exp\n(\u2212r\u03b82\/2) factor. Because of this fast variation\nrelative to the X-scale, we must solve (7) locally using \u03b8\ninstead of X as the slow scale. In doing so, we find that\nrhsN produces the particular solution\n\u03b4f+ = \u03b5\u22122\u03b3`\u20322\nF0e\n\u2212ix\u00af + F2eix\u00af\n2\nei\u03d5\u2212i\u03b2 ln \u03b5\n\u222b \u03b8\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212rv\n2\/2\u221a\n2pi\/r\ndv\nin \u03b4f , where \u03b3 = \u03b5\u22124 exp\n(\u2212pi\/\u03b52) and `\u20322 =\n4pi`2 exp (\u03b2pi\/4). In this expression, the integral factor\nvanishes as \u03b8 \u2192 \u2212\u221e (corresponding toX = i(pi\u2212r)+0\u2212)\nand equals one as \u03b8 \u2192 \u221e (corresponding to X =\ni(pi\u2212 r)+ 0+). Thus \u03b4f+ is \u201cswitched on\u201d upon crossing\nthe Stokes line towards positive values of X [18]. Finally,\nhaving obtained \u03b4f+, the complementary contribution\n\u03b4f\u2212 associated to the pole X = \u2212ipi makes \u03b4f real on\nthe real-X axis. Hence, for X < 0,\n\u03b4f = \u03b4fE ,\n0.448 0.45 0.452 0.454\nEhg\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\u00b0\nf\u00b4\n2\nFIG. 1: Bifurcation diagram for \u03b5 = 0.55. Thick line: analyt-\nical formula.

Indeed, \u03b4f ,\nalthough exponentially small, is an exponentially increas-\ning function of X and this ultimately leads to a down-\nswitching front. Assembling the various pieces of solution\nwe have obtained thus far, we construct a finite periodic\ndomain of size d \u00c0 1. On the left of the domain, the\nsolution is given by the approximate formula\nf (x,X;\u03d5L) \u2248 f0 (x+ \u03d5L, X) + \u03b4f (x,X;\u03d5L) ,\nwhile, by symmetry, the right side is described by the\ndown-switching front f\n(\nd\u2212 x, \u03b52d\u2212X;\u03d5R\n)\n. From (6),\nthe oscillations in the left part are controlled by the\nexponential factor exp i(x + \u03d5L \u2212 \u03b2X\/2) as X \u2192 \u221e,\nwhile in the right part, the corresponding factor is\nexp i(x \u2212 d \u2212 \u03d5R \u2212 \u03b2X\/2 + \u03b52\u03b2d\/2) as \u03b52d \u2212 X \u2192 \u221e.\nIn order for these oscillations to smoothly join, we thus\nhave to impose\n\u03d5L = \u2212\u03d5R \u2212 d+ \u03b52\u03b2d\/2 + 2mpi,\nwhere m is an arbitrary integer. Considering\nnext slow-varying amplitudes, the exponentially grow-\ning terms in \u03b4f(x,X, \u03d5L) [see (8) and (10)] must\nmatch the exponential start of the down-switching in\nf0\n(\nd\u2212 x+ \u03d5R, \u03b52d\u2212X\n)\n. This leads to \u03d5R = \u03d5L and\n\u03b4E = \u00b1\u03b3 c1 cos(2\u2212 \u03b5\n2\u03b2\n4\nd+ \u03b2 ln \u03b5+ c2) + 2\u03b52E2e\u2212\u03b5\n2d.\n(13)\nThe latter is the bifurcation equation between the bifur-\ncation parameter \u03b4E and the front separation d. The\nconstants c1 and c2 are proportional to |`\u20322| and arg `\u20322\nand hence must be determined numerically. This bifur-\ncation equation actually defines two interlaced snaking\nbifurcation curves; one corresponds to an even number\nof peaks, the other to an odd number of peaks.\n40.45 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75\n\u0395\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nDE\nFIG. 2: Amplitude of the snaking oscillations (pinning range)\nin Fig. 1 as a function of \u03b5.

This is again fully confirmed, as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe value c1 can be determined graphically by plotting\n1\n2\u2206E\u03b5\n4 exppi\/\u03b52. All the points in Fig. 2 then appear on\nan horizontal line of height c1 \u2248 2.439. Next, c2 = \u22120.5\nprovides the best fit in Fig. 1.\nIn conclusion, a consistent analysis beyond all orders of\nthe weakly nonlinear analysis elucidates the interaction\nbetween the slow and fast scales in pattern-forming in-\nstabilities. This interaction takes places near the Stokes\nline that joins the two first poles of the slow-varying front\nand leads to the emergence of exponentially small terms\nin the solution. These eventually dominate and lead to\na second, down-switching front, thus allowing us to an-\nalyze localized structures asymptotically. Furthermore\nthe analysis can easily be extended to the study of a\nlarger number of fronts, to dynamical fronts, and the ef-\nfect of noise, whereby d becomes an exponentially slow\nfunction of time. Because the analysis presented is local,\nit bears the same generality as any bifurcation analysis\nand is not restricted to the particular equation that we\nhave studied here. In particular, Eq. (1) can be deduced\nin some limit from the diffraction-type Ginzburg-Landau\nequation with saturable nonlinearity [22]. In principle,\nit could be applied to any subcritical Turing instability\nnear the Maxwell point.\nThis research was supported in part by the Fonds\nNational de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS, Belgium)\nand the Interuniversity Attraction Pole Program of the\nBelgian government.
