There have been a number of evaluations of welfare to work interventions, and one \nof the key critiques to emerge is absence of gender related concerns in this strategy. These criticisms \nhave virtually all focused on the impact of this gap on women and to date, there has been very little \nconsideration given to the impacts of a gender-blind social policy approach on men.  Drawing on the \nresults of two qualitative case study evaluations of welfare to work interventions in the North-East of \nEngland, this article begins to address this gap.   \n \nWelfare to work policy  \nThe election of New Labour in 1997 signalled a new approach to tackling poverty and social \nexclusion in the UK.  Drawing heavily from policy approaches in the USA, Blair called for a shift away \nfrom what he termed \u201epassive Welfare\u201f, which he critiqued for \u201eleaving people doing nothing, rather \nthan helping them become active\u201f (Blair in a speech to the Party of European Socialists' Congress in \nJune 1997, quoted in Theodore & Peck, 1999: 486).  In its place, the government made it clear that \nthe emphasis was to be firmly on ensuring that as many people as possible were employed in the \nformal economy.  Where people were unable to secure jobs, they would be encouraged to undertake \ntraining to improve their \u201eemployability\u201f: \n \n\u201eThe best way to tackle poverty is to help people into jobs \u2013 real jobs.  The unemployed have \na responsibility to take up the opportunity of training places or work, but these must be real \nopportunities.\u201f Labour Party 1997 General Election Manifesto (Dale, 2000: 360) \n \nWelfare to work policies have remained popular with the government: Shortly before Blair resigned as \nPrime Minister, he gave a speech in which he re-stated his belief that work is \u201ethe best form of \nwelfare\u201f (Blair, 2007) and, since taking over as Prime Minister Brown has underlined the continuing \npopularity of the welfare to work strategy: \n\u201e[T]he biggest barrier to full employment is now not the shortage of jobs but the shortage of \nskills among the unemployed and inactive.  The biggest barrier to Britain's success in the \njobs of the future: a skills deficit particularly amongst the low paid. [\u2026] Our first priority is to \nmove welfare claimants from passive recipients of benefit to active job and skill seekers and \nto match the talents of those on the dole to the needs of local employers.\u201f (Brown, 2008) \nOngoing commitment to the welfare to work agenda has been further demonstrated in the 2008 \nWelfare Reform Act in which \u201epassive\u201f Incapacity Benefit was replaced with \u201eactive\u201f Employment \nSupport Allowance (Bambra, 2008).   \n \nEvaluations of welfare to work interventions suggest that the general policy approach has been \nrelatively successful at the national level (Evans, Eyre, Millar, & Sarre, 2003; Finn, 2003; Loumidis et \nal., 2001; Sunley, Martin, & Nativel, 2001).  However, an analysis of the impact of the New Deal for \nYoung People, one of the most developed of the welfare to work schemes, claims that positive \nevaluations at the national level mask important regional variations; disparities which suggest that the \npolicy has had far less success in high need inner city and depressed industrial areas (Sunley et al., \n2001).  Echoing this, Finn\u201fs (2003) evaluation also finds that local labour markets play an important \nrole in the success of the New Deal for Young People and that different social groups may be \ndifferentially affected.  Similarly, a systematic review of welfare to work policies for Incapacity Benefit \nclaimants (such as the New Deal for Disabled People) concludes that it is not possible to say which \ninterventions are effective or for whom (Bambra, Whitehead, & Hamilton, 2005).  Existing evaluations \nof some of the major welfare to work policy approaches do not, therefore, imply that they provide a \npanacea to resolving the \u201epolicy problem\u201f of worklessness. \n \nWhat is more, welfare to work policy has been criticised for making a number of questionable \nassumptions. Firstly, in emphasising the need to improve people\u201fs skills, the government\u201fs \nconception of the problem focuses almost entirely on the \u201esupply-side\u201f, with very little space being \ngiven to considering potential interventions on the \u201edemand-side\u201f (Cressey, 1999).  In relation to this, \nthe policy approach has been criticised for failing to consider the spatial concentration of \nworklessness in some areas, such as parts of Northern England or South Wales (e.g. Turok & \nWebster, 1998).  Secondly, official statements often appear to suggest that by securing employment, \nindividuals will automatically become \u201esocially included\u201f and able to break free of the experience of \npoverty (see Levitas, 1998).  Yet, although poverty, employment and social exclusion are related, \nthey are also different (Atkinson, 1998; Lister, 2000) and, consequently, policy interventions which \naim to tackle one of these issues will not necessarily help with the others.  Thirdly, the approach \ntends to assume that employment is always better than worklessness (e.g. Black, 2008), even though \nthere is little robust evidence to support this assumption in regard to the low quality and low paying \njobs that most people exiting benefit obtain (Broom et al., 2006).  Fourthly, these statements \nfrequently imply that only employment within the formal economy is considered real \u201ework\u201f.  Other \nkinds of work, particularly the caring work of looking after children, ill and elderly relations, are \nimplicitly demoted (Lister, 2000).  Finally, gender identities are rendered invisible through statements \nwhich promote employment in the formal economy as an \u201eopportunity\u201f that all individuals ought to \nembrace equally and for which \u201egender-blind\u201f interventions are apposite (see Lewis, 2007; and Rake, \n2000).  Whilst touching upon a number of these concerns, it is this final issue with which this article is \nmost concerned. \n \nTo date, there have been a number of critiques of the absence of gender related concerns in the \ngovernment\u201fs welfare to work approach but these have virtually all focused on the impact of this gap \non women.  For example, Lewis (2007) argues that, by assuming all men and women can be equally \nactive in the labour market and ignoring the continuing gendered division of paid and unpaid work, \nsuch policies are likely to exacerbate gender inequalities.  Similarly, MacLeavy (2007) argues that, \nbecause gender remains central to the political and economic organisation of society, welfare to work \npolicies which ignore gender divisions only serve to further entrench them (see also Burns, 2000; \nHague, Thomas, & Williams, 2001; Lister, 2000, 2006; Rake, 2000).  So far, very little consideration \nhas been given to the impacts of a gender-blind policy approach on men.  This is despite an \nincreasing acknowledgement of the importance of interrogating men as gendered beings within policy \norientated research (see, for example, McIlwaine & Datta, 2003), which is at least partially informed \nby nearly two decades of work exploring the heterogeneity and fluidity of masculine identities, \nparticularly in the context of changing socio-economic environments (e.g. Connell, 1995; Hearn & \nPringle, 2006; Jackson, 1991; Lupton, 2000; McDowell, 2003a, 2003b). \n \nThis article begins to address this gap, although it is important to stress at the outset that it is in no \nway intended to challenge the work of those who have drawn attention to the ways in which \nsupposedly \u201egender-neutral\u201f policies serve to further entrench gender inequalities between men and \nwomen.  Rather, the argument presented here merely suggests that, in order to effectively challenge \nthe gender divisions that are embedded within society, it is important to also explore the impact of \nsuch policy interventions on some groups of men.  In making this case, the article draws on data from \na qualitative evaluation of two welfare to work projects in the North-East of England, as the following \nsection describes. \nCase Study Context and Methods \nLike other formally industrialised areas, much of the north of England continues to be affected by the \nlegacy of the decline in heavy industries and this trend is particularly apparent in County Durham, \nwith its industrial heritage of coal and iron mining and construction.  Economic inactivity in parts of the \ncounty are well above the national average and job density levels in many localities are amongst the \nlowest in the country (Hastings, 2006).  The area is also known to suffer a disproportionate burden of \npoor health, with deaths from smoking and early deaths from cancer, heart disease and stroke rating \nall significantly higher than the national average (Association of Public Health Observatories & \nDepartment of Health, 2008). \n \nAs described above, since Labour came to power in 1997, a range of area-based initiatives have \nbeen implemented with the intention of tackling embedded deprivation, long term poverty and \nassociated inequalities in health.  One such example is the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, which \nwas designed to increase funding available in the most deprived 88 wards across the country to \nencourage economic re-growth and improve the prospects of disadvantaged communities in terms of \nhealth, education, housing and employment (Department for Communities and Local Government, \n2008).  It is in this context that Neighbourhood Renewal Funding was used to finance a range of \nprojects designed to tackle worklessness in County Durham between 2006 and 2008.  \nAcknowledging the complexity of worklessness, and the inter-linked nature of many of the problems \nfacing communities in County Durham, local policymakers decided to implement a multifaceted \nprogramme involving thirteen different types of intervention, each of which was intended to tackle a \nslightly different aspect of worklessness.  The programme included projects focusing on health-\nrelated worklessness, schemes intended to improve and develop participants\u201f work-relevant skills, \nand projects which tried to increase individuals\u201f chances of engaging in paid work by improving their \nconfidence and self-esteem.  Some of the interventions, particularly those designed to support \nspecific social groups, combined more than one of these approaches.  In keeping with the emphasis \nwithin national policy, all thirteen projects focused on the supply side of the labour market (rather than \nthe demand side), were area-based and funded by short-term (finite) resources. \n \nIn order to examine how effective this approach was, local policymakers commissioned researchers \nat Durham University to examine participants\u201f experiences of the initiatives.  A comprehensive \naccount of the findings has been published elsewhere (Joyce, Smith, & Bambra, 2008).  This paper \nfocuses on the data relating to two of the initiatives included within this broader programme, each of \nwhich provides pertinent insights into the role that gender issues can play in welfare to work style \ninterventions.  The first, which we refer to in this paper as Case Study One, was a project intended to \nprovide support to \u201eyoung parents\u201f, with the aim of both supporting their transition into parenthood \n(babies were with either unborn or less than one year old) and increasing their future employment \nprospects.  It was intended to develop and extend existing Sure Start initiatives focusing on young \nparents in order to improve health, education and social outcomes during pregnancy and beyond. \nFunding was to be used in reshaping services to meet the needs of young parents and to encourage \nyoung fathers\u201f involvement in the upbringing of their children. Project work included: tailoring ante \nnatal\/post natal services to support healthcare, parenting skills, access to education, training and \nwork, childcare, sexual health and family planning. By incorporating both group-work and one-to-one \nsessions, the project aimed to encourage participation in the local management of children\u201fs centres \nand extended services. With regard to worklessness, the project aimed to encourage young people to \nengage in volunteering as a pathway to employment and training. A final objective was to raise \nawareness about, and support, young parents who were experiencing domestic violence. \n \nAlthough the overall research approach largely employed focus groups, it was deemed, by both the \nresearchers and the project coordinators, that face-to-face interviews would be a more appropriate \nmeans of exploring participants\u201f experiences of Case Study One, due to the sensitive and stigmatised \nnature of some issues relating to teenage parenthood.  Hence, a series of in-depth, face-to-face \ninterviews were undertaken with participants in this project, which ranged in length from 20 to 45 \nminutes.  Fifteen participants, who ranged in age between 16 and 23 years, were interviewed in total, \ntwelve of whom opted to be interviewed as a couple (i.e. six interviews with couples) and three of \nwhom were interviewed alone.  Of the three mothers interviewed alone, only one identified herself as \na single mother (reflecting national trends, which suggest only about a quarter of teenage mothers \nnow become \u201esingle mothers\u201f (Duncan, 2007: 311)). \n \nThe second intervention focused on in this paper, Case Study Two, was designed to improve the \nnumeracy and literacy skills of unemployed individuals, before facilitating their participation in \nchildcare NVQs or other \u201eSkills for Life\u201f courses.  A range of diverse courses were offered within this \nproject including \u201eChill Out and Change\u201f (a course, generic in nature, which provided the opportunity \nfor learners to experience a range of vocational tasters such as family learning, crafts and supporting \nchildren with mathematics and English), \u201eHealthy Eating\u201f (a course which sought to introduce healthy \neating through learning whilst also assessing numeracy and literacy needs), and \u201eInitial Assessment \nof Literacy\u201f (a course which concentrated on assessing literacy through specific vocational topics, \nsuch as information technology, money matters, woodwork, craft etc.  The intention was that these \nnew skills would open up new employment prospects for participants, within their local areas. This \nproject therefore focused largely on the provision of education and training for participants and was \ndelivered in local community settings. For this intervention, a focus group, which lasted approximately \none hour, was used to explore the experiences of seven participants (four men and three women), \nwho had all participated in the childcare NVQ.  All of the participants in the focus group knew each \nother as a result of this training and the group appeared friendly and supportive of one another. \n \nA semi-structured approach was taken to both case studies.  The research was approved by Durham \nUniversity\u201fs School for Health\u201fs Ethics Committee.  In line with ethical guidance, participants\u201f \nidentities remain anonymous.  All of the recordings of the interviews and focus groups were \ntranscribed in full by an independently contracted firm, with whom a confidentiality agreement was in \nplace.  The transcripts were then thematically coded by two experienced qualitative researchers \nusing the qualitative data analysis software programme, Atlas.ti.  The coding framework employed \nwas developed abductively.  A full methodological account of the study is available elsewhere (Joyce \nSmith, & Bambra, 2008). \n \nResults and Discussion \nCase study 1 - Young Parents Project  \nYoung parents\u201f attempts to adopt traditional gender roles \nIn contrast to official policy portrayals of teenage parenthood as a \u201epernicious social problem\u201f \n(Duncan, 2007: 307), all of the interviewees expressed positive attitudes towards becoming young \nparents with parenthood considered \u201emore an opportunity than a catastrophe\u201f (Duncan, 2007: 308). \nAll of the participants suggested that expecting\/having a child had triggered a desire to plan ahead \nparticularly financially (a finding evident in a great deal of research on teenage parents, e.g. Giullari & \nShaw, 2005; Graham & McDermott, 2005; and Hanna, 2001).  It was the young fathers who felt under \nmost immediate pressure to financially support the new family unit, which reflects research \nhighlighting the importance many young fathers attach to being able to act as an economic provider \nfor their children (Bunting & McAuley, 2004).  Amongst the couples, it was universally clear that the \nmain pressure to provide an income for the family especially in the first year of the baby\u201fs life rested \nwith the fathers. In other words, where possible, the young parents we interviewed were attempting to \nadopt traditional gender roles with regards to the split between formal employment and caring work. \n \nEchoing a great deal of the research into experiences of teenage parenthood, all participants \nreported experiencing financial difficulties and all expressed feeling frustrated by the difficulties in \nearning enough money to support their family (e.g. Giullari & Shaw, 2005; Hanna, 2001).  Even those \nwho had experienced recent employment reported that it was extremely difficult to cover the cost of \nday-to-day living on the wages they earned.  This underlines the fact that paid work does not \nnecessarily provide a route out of poverty and social exclusion (see Lister, 2000; MacLeavy, 2007). \nNevertheless, in stark contradiction to some policy portrayals of young fathers as \u201efeckless\u201f (see \nGiullari & Shaw, 2005), all of the young fathers expressed a strong desire (often verging on \ndesperation) to work and be able to provide for their family.  Indeed, for the young men we \ninterviewed, fatherhood was frequently described in ways which suggested it was almost \nsynonymous with an ability to provide an income for the family. For example: \n \n\u201eI\u201fll find work in a job that I don\u201ft want to do just to get work to be able to support my family. \n[\u2026] I\u201fm not going to get [my partner] pregnant and run away, that\u201fs not me.  I stay, you know.  \nThat\u201fs what dads are for.  That\u201fs what dads should be.  They shouldn\u201ft get someone \npregnant and run away.\u201f \n \nAll of the young fathers appeared to believe that a central part of their new role as fathers involved \nproviding adequately for their family and yet they felt it was unlikely they would be able to enact this \n(gendered) role.  All but one of the young fathers had experienced recent unemployment and none \nappeared positive about their future employment prospects, mainly due to a lack of qualifications \nexperience, and\/or skills, combined with poor employment opportunities in the local area and the high \ncost and poor reliability of public transport. Coupled with the fact that, as new (or expectant) fathers, \nthese interviewees were all undertaking one of the most significant transitions in the life-course, it is \nperhaps unsurprising that several seemed to be experiencing feelings of despondency and low self-\nesteem: \n \n \u201eI\u201fve never really been confident in many things so.  But I don\u201ft know, I just worry about things, I \nget paranoid about stuff\u201f. \n \n\u201eI tick the boxes of a bum, basically \u2013 they [potential employers] are not interested in me\u201f. \n \nGendered assumptions underlying the intervention  \nParadoxically, whilst the young fathers seemed to constitute a group that would particularly benefit \nfrom welfare to work interventions, being both keen to take up employment and at a point in their lives \nwhere they were consciously planning for the future, they appeared to have benefited less from this \nintervention than the young mothers.  Nearly all of the young mothers were overwhelmingly positive \nabout the intervention and its contribution to their awareness of available training and employment \nopportunities, but none of the young fathers reported that the intervention had helped them in this \nrespect.  A central problem with the intervention\u201fs approach to young fathers seems to have been the \nway in which participants were recruited; all of the young fathers reported that they had only heard \nabout the project through their partners: \n \nYoung father: \u201eThey just told her [referring to partner]\u201f. \n \nYoung father: \u201eI never heard about it until \u2026\u201f \nYoung mother: \u201eUntil I told you about four weeks after\u201f. \n \nFurther, many of the young fathers interviewed described feeling unsupported on a range of fronts, \nparticularly by local employment agencies: \n \n\u201eThere\u201fs no support there for me\u201f. \n \n\u201eThey don\u201ft do enough help for you really.  I mean I\u201fm registered now with four or five \nagencies and to me they don\u201ft bother looking for you, you know.  They just fob you off with a \nwhole lot of junk\u201f. \n \nThe comments stand in marked contrast to those made by the young mothers, who nearly all \nreported feeling that they had received a great deal of support, both in relation to pregnancy and \nchildcare and in relation to planning their future careers.  Although we acknowledge that young \nmothers are not always well-supported by interventions (e.g. Clarke, 2006; Duncan, 2007; Giullari & \nShaw, 2005; Kidger, 2004), in the case of this particular intervention it was the lack of support and \nguidance offered to young fathers that was most noticeable. This reflects broader research \nhighlighting the absence of support offered to young fathers (Bunting & McAuley, 2004; Speake, \nCameron, & Gilroy, 1997). As the following quotation illustrates, this gap can impact on mothers and \ntheir babies as well as on the young fathers themselves: \n \nYoung mother: \u201eAt first he [the father] wouldn\u201ft hold the bairn when he was first born because he \nwas frightened.  He didn\u201ft know what to do, and it was like teaching him kind of thing.  I know \nthis is going to sound horrible too but if someone had shown him before, it would have saved me \nbeing tired\u201f. \n \nTaken together, the extracts discussed in this theme demonstrate that despite the expressed \nintention of this project to focus on \u201eyoung parents\u201f, it appeared to have, in practical terms, shifted to a \nfocus on \u201eyoung mothers\u201f. This is mirrored in some national policy statements (see, for example, \nGiullari & Shaw, 2005; Kidger, 2004) and reflects broader research highlighting the lack of support \noffered to young fathers.  Overall, the data from Case Study 1 reflect Bunting & McAuley\u201fs (2004) \nreview, which suggests young fathers constitute a group who, whilst very much in need of support, \nremain relatively untouched by the raft of recent policy interventions designed to tackle social \nexclusion and worklessness.   \n \nCase study 2: Childcare training for the unemployed \n Negotiating non-traditional gender roles in a gender-blind initiative \nIn direct contrast to Case Study 1, Case Study 2 involved an intervention which actively (albeit \nimplicitly) encouraged unemployed fathers to adopt non-traditional gender roles.  This is not an issue \nwhich has yet been explored in any detail by researchers, who have tended to focus only on the \nexperiences of women who have chosen to work in traditionally male environments (e.g. Andrew, \n2005) or on men who have themselves chosen (rather than been actively encouraged) to enter \ntraditionally female work environments (e.g. Lupton, 2000; Williams, 1995).  In this case, none of the \nmale participants had actively sought to gain entry to a childcare training scheme and, indeed, as the \nfollowing quotations reflect, many had clear reservations about the project based on their own \nperceptions of the gendered division of labour.  Yet their participation had been actively encouraged \nby various staff with whom they had some contact (most were staff at a local Sure Start centre, where \nmany of the fathers regularly took their children): \n \n\u201eWhen I first heard of the dads\u201f groups [I thought], \u201eI'm not going to sit with a bunch of dads \ntalking about kids,\u201f sort of thing. So you do have that stigmata [sic] sort of thing, so\u2026 but \nonce you do get down there, it\u201fs like, \u201eWow this is great\u2026\u201f\u201f \n \n\u201eJust when I brought my boy here [\u2026] [Blank \u2013 staff member at the Sure Start centre] said, \n\u201eOh look they\u201fre doing a childcare course on a Tuesday - why don\u201ft you go along?\u201f and again \nit\u201fs, \u201eI'm not doing that, it\u201fs for women,\u201f sort of thing and she said, \u201eNo, no it\u201fs just dads,\u201f and I \ncame in and I'm still here and now I'm looking to make a career out of it because, again, \nthere's nothing really out there worth going for any more, not for what I've done in the past \nanyway.\u201f \n \nBoth of the above accounts show that, although initially wary of participating in what they believed to \nbe a predominantly women\u201fs activity, the fathers claimed that they had quickly become extremely \nenthusiastic about the prospect of becoming involved in paid childcare work. Importantly, though, \ntheir initial decisions to participate were also influenced by the fact that all of the other participants \nwere (at first) also male, as well as their awareness that structural changes in the local labour market \nmeant employment opportunities in sectors that they might have ordinarily focused on were extremely \nlimited.   \n \nFurthermore, for most of the focus group participants, engaging with a course on childcare training \nwas not the first time in which their views of their traditional gender roles had been challenged.  For \nexample, as the following extracts illustrate, most were already the main carers of their own children: \n \n\u201eWell my wife works long shifts and that's why he [my son] is with me a lot and so he's all mine \nnow. Not by choice.\u201f\u201f \n \n\u201eMy wife will turn round and joke to me and she\u201fll say, if I was to go tomorrow, she'd be stuck \nbecause she wouldn\u201ft know what to do, you know, and she says, \u201cI can\u201ft believe that you know \nmore about bringing that child up than what I do and I\u201fm his mother, it should be me who knows \nwhat to do,\u201d sort of thing but like you say the roles are reversing now.\u201f \n \nWhilst the first of the two extracts above demonstrates that the speaker was keen to ensure others \nwere aware that his role as the main carer of his son was not a role that he had chosen freely, the \nother two male participants presented their role more similarly to the second speaker, by emphasising \nthe importance that both they and others placed on their role in caring for their children.  At the same \ntime, however, these conversations tended to present a scenario in which the changes in traditional \ngender roles were happening \u201eout there\u201f, beyond anyone\u201fs immediate control.  In the last quotation, \nfor example, the speaker explains that \u201ethe roles are reversing now\u201f, something which he presents as \na fact, rather than something that anyone is actively trying to achieve.  He also reflects that his wife \nstill feels that she, rather than him, should be \u201ebringing the child up\u201f, which suggests that their \napproach to division of labour within their family would have been more traditional if circumstances \nhad allowed.   \n Studies of men who are in employed roles that are traditionally occupied by women have found they \nemploy a variety of different strategies to negotiate their gender identity within these roles, often in \nways which allow them to embrace traditional masculinities (Williams, 1995).  For example, Lupton \n(2000) categorises these strategies into three broad approaches: (i) emphasising the positive career \nopportunities provided by the new role; (ii) identifying with other, more powerful, male groups who are \nassociated with the role; (iii) representing the work as more masculine than others might perceive.  \nHowever, only the first of these three strategies was clearly visible in our data: \n \n\u201eWell to be honest with you I think, speaking from a dad\u201fs point of view, I think a dad would \nhave a good chance of getting into a childcare setting because I think they are wanting that, \nthey\u201fre wanting more males involved in that setting. So I'm hoping that my prospects are \nreally good.\u201f \n \nThis strategy was linked to another: rather than representing the work as more masculine than it \nmight traditionally be perceived (the third strategy identified by Lupton, 2000), the participants \nconstructed the lack of male involvement in childcare as a societal problem that they were helping to \naddress.  In particular, they suggested that the lack of male interaction likely to be available to some \nchildren (such as those of single mothers) was a difficulty that they had the potential to help resolve: \n \n\u201eI would have said, you know, like especially if they\u201fre single parents, or single mothers they \nwant some, it\u201fs nice to have some input from men, do you know what I mean?  So if you've \ngot a man carer well then\u2026\u201f \n \n\u201eIf you see that there's a male in your childcare setting and you are on your own as a mother, \nyou know, you think, \u201eOh well at least he's going to have some interaction with a male,\u201f which \nis good\u2026\u201f \n\u201eIt\u201fs that male bonding thing yeah.\u201f \n\u201e\u2026 and not be brought up by total female, you know, in a totally female environment. So it is \ngood to have a mixture, a mix of\u2026\u201f \n \nUnlike the men involved in Lupton\u201fs (2000) study, there is no evidence in the data to indicate that the \nmen tried to denigrate or criticise women\u201fs approaches to childcare.  Rather, they merely argued that \nmen had something qualitatively different to offer.  By taking on a responsibility for addressing the \nproblem they had articulated \u2013 the lack of male interaction likely to be available to the children of \nsingle mothers \u2013 some of the fathers were then able to present their move into paid childcare in an \nalmost sacrificial way, as something they were doing to help others, rather than an option they had \ntaken because of the limited alternatives available: \n \n\u201eAt the end of the day, we\u201fre not doing it for the money, are we? Because it\u201fs not exactly the best \npaid job in the world - I could walk out now and get a better paid job if I went to Asda, so it\u201fs not \nbeing done for the sake that I'm doing it financial. So I mean, you know, it is a good thing that \nthe dads are doing it and there's more males getting into it...\u201f \n \nYet, at the same time, as explained above, they were also acutely aware that changes in the local \nlabour market and the wider economy meant that the employment routes they might have traditionally \npursued (and, in some cases, had previously pursued) were increasingly limited:  \n \n\u201eI mean the thing is there's no heavy industry, there's no industry or anything around here now. \nSo whereas you've had the secretary jobs etc. them jobs have now changed they haven\u201ft left the \narea but you\u201fre finding now like the mines are gone, you know the steel industry\u201fs out the \nwindow now, the automotive trade\u201fs on the way out\u2026\u201f \n\u201eSome of the factories have gone.\u201f \n\u201eSo yes, you know, the partners are becoming the breadwinners really. So it\u201fs us striking out\u2026 \nit\u201fs us hopping onto that ladder now and becoming the secretaries, becoming the child carers \nand\u2026\u201f \n\u201eThere's a lot more house-husbands nowadays than what there was.\u201f \n \nOverall, then, the focus group data provides the impression that the men involved had not \nindependently chosen to become involved in a non-traditional career trajectory (the paid and unpaid \ncare of children) but were rather responding to the changing opportunities in the revised labour \nmarket context, a move which was facilitated by the direct encouragement of some local project \norganisers.  Nevertheless, they appeared to have responded positively to the potential new career \nopportunities they perceived to be offered within childcare and had managed to negotiate their \ngender identity in a way which appeared neither to compromise their gender (as studies of women in \nnon-traditional careers suggests they often do, e.g. Andrew, 2005), nor depend on the denigration of \nwomen in the occupation (a tactic Lupton (2000) and others (e.g. Williams, 1995) have found \nevidence of).  However, the data also make it clear that negotiating their gender identity was far from \nan easy task for the men, a point the following sub-section explores further. \n \nPerforming gender in a gender-blind intervention \nAlthough it was clear to the male participants in Case Study 2 that they were being required to \nrenegotiate their gender identity, the intervention\u201fs gender-blind approach afforded them no support \nin this. This became particularly apparent when the men discussed how they felt the dynamics of the \nclasses had changed when women were introduced to the same sessions: \n \n\u201e\u2026 to be honest we could joke about things and what was said in here was said in here, you \nknow, but we felt when we went with the women, I don\u201ft know if the women overpowered us, you \nknow, and we weren't used to them, you know?\u201f \n\u201eUh huh, I know what you mean, it\u201fs more like cosy just us and the teacher and yeah.\u201f \n\u201eAnd I suppose you can speak your mind a bit better. You feel as if you\u201fre not like, [gasps] on \nshow kind of thing or, yeah you can say what you want to say then can\u201ft you?\u201f \n \n\u201eWell\u2026 you can\u201ft be as rugged as what you would do with, you know, there are times now when \nI'm in there and you go to say something and you think, \u201eOops no hang on I shouldn\u201ft say that.\u201f\u201f \n\u201eIt\u201fs strange though, that, because the day we only had women we were more rugged or \nwhatever than when Mark and Paul\u201fs there. We said things that we thought, \u201eOooh,\u201f and maybe \nwe wouldn\u201ft have said if the lads were here, you know what I mean? So\u2026\u201f \n \nThe first quotation suggests that part of the men\u201fs discomfort at women joining the group was merely \nthat it disrupted the rapport they had developed, both with each other and with the facilitator\/teacher.  \nHowever, the way in which the final speaker in this extract describes feeling that he was \u201eon show\u201f \nwhen women were present reflects some of the extensive literature which theorises gender as a \nperformative act, which men and women engage with differently in different contexts with the purpose \nof communicating their gendered identities (Butler, 1990; Thorne, 1993).  This is further supported by \nthe way in which both this speaker and those in the second extract described feeling under pressure \nto constrain their conversation in order to ensure it was \u201eacceptable\u201f in a mixed environment, in a way \nwhich they had not felt necessary in a male only environment.  The first speaker articulates this \nexperience by employing a very traditional perspective of gender, implying that there are some \nelements of men\u201fs conversations which it is not \u201epolite\u201f to engage with in the presence of women.  \nThis is particularly apparent in the use of the adjective \u201erugged\u201f to describe how it is possible to be in \na male only environment.  Yet, interestingly, the second speaker in this quotation reflects that he \nactually felt the need to perform this kind of masculinity more overtly in the company of women than \nhe had when engaging only with other men. \n \nThe pressure to be able to perform in certain ways in front of women was further apparent when one \nof the participants reflected on the embarrassment he felt about his learning difficulty in a mixed \ngroup compared to a male only setting: \n \n\u201eI think if you\u201fre male and you've got a learning difficulty, if you\u201fre in a surrounding with males \nyou don\u201ft feel as bad but I think, again, if you\u201fre in a mixed setting you'll feel even more aware \nbecause\u2026 and again I'm sure it would be the same for the girls as well. If you had a difficulty \nyou\u201fd feel the same as well.\u201f \n \nIt was also clear that part of the perceived problem with a mixed group was a fear that, as a result of \nthe traditional gender division of labour, women would automatically feel more comfortable and \nknowledgeable in a childcare setting and might, therefore, down-play what the men had learnt: \n \n\u201eSome of the dads thought, \u201eYou know what women are like,\u201f pardon the expression, you know, \n\u201ewe know better,\u201f sort of thing, not realising that some of the dads had already done level\u2026 entry \nlevel and level one and we could most probably help them more than they could have helped \nus.\u201f \n \nThe introduction of women to the class without (according to the male focus group participants) any \nnegotiation or forewarning, left men who were actively involved in negotiating their gendered \nidentities feeling vulnerable and uncomfortable.  For some of them, the difficulties caused by this \nwere so great that they decided to leave the training scheme as a result.  Hence, the failure to \nprovide space or support to help the male participants deal with re-negotiating their gendered \nidentities appears to have been a fundamental flaw in the intervention. \n \nAttempting to locate new identities in traditional landscapes \nThis final sub-section explores how the male participants in Case Study 2 described trying to fit their \nnew identities into the landscapes in which they lived, landscapes which were not necessarily \nhospitable to the new roles they were attempting to carve for themselves.  Once again, this analysis \ndemonstrates the necessity of acknowledging, and providing support for, the re-negotiation of \ngendered identities. \n \nAs explained above, the male participants in this intervention were keen to emphasise the positive \naspects of their involvement in childcare.  This extended to recounting the reaction of the children \ninvolved: \n \n\u201eI just did my placement this morning and she actually asked the parents. She said, \u201cLook we\u201fre \ngoing to have a male student coming in and doing the childcare,\u201d and she said and everybody \nwere great. [\u2026] Now the only thing they thought about was obviously how the children would \nreact but I mean they got a shock this morning because I was swamped straightaway.\u201f \n \nThis extract serves to further demonstrate the men\u201fs positive attitudes to their role in childcare work \nbut, at the same time, the fact that the female child carer described in the above story felt it \nnecessary to explain to parents that a man would be getting involved with the childcare underlines the \nsecond key problem with the intervention in this case study.  This was that, despite the enthusiasm of \nmost of the male participants, they described having experienced significant resistance to enacting \ntheir new roles, both from other parents in the local community and from potential employers.  \nSeveral of the participants claimed this meant they had been unable to secure work placements or \njobs in childcare settings, despite their qualifications.  Consequently, some of the participants had \nundertaken a survey of parents in the local community to explore this issue: \n \n\u201eAnd there again we went through, what was it, assembly here, didn\u201ft we at [Blank] Street on \nchildcare and dads and they did a survey there\u2026 on how many women or mothers would trust \ntheir kids with a male and you\u201fd be quite surprised at how low it was.\u201f \n \n\u201eMost people that they interviewed came from all cultures and different nurseries and all saying, \n\u201eWhat do you think about men in childcare,\u201f and there was a few people said, \u201eI wouldn\u201ft have a \nman, not for my kid.\u201f\u201f \n \nIn other words, the intervention had encouraged men to participate in an employment-orientated \nchildcare training scheme which required them to re-negotiate their own gendered identities but which \ndid not consider the potential difficulties that they might subsequently experience in securing \nplacements and jobs.  By focusing solely on the \u201fsupply\u201f side of the economy and not at all on the \n\u201edemand\u201f side (Cressey, 1999), the intervention left several of the participants struggling to find \nemployment experience in a childcare setting.  The positive comments about the intervention made \nby many of the fathers suggest that the broad aim of the project was entirely appropriate.  However, \nto be successful, the male participants suggested that the intervention\u201fs architects needed to reflect \nmore carefully on the gendered nature of childcare and, consequently, on the additional support that \nthey, as men, might require.  Hence, whilst most of the existing work critiquing \u201egender-blind\u201f policies \nhighlights the negative consequences of such approaches for women  (e.g. MacLeavy, 2007;  Rake, \n2000), in this particular case, men were also harmed by the approach. \n \nConcluding comments \nAlthough the two case studies presented in this paper are quite distinct, each places a spotlight on \nthe centrality of gender to interventions which aim to tackle worklessness.  In Case Study 1, the \ngender-neutrality of an intervention to support \u201eyoung parents\u201f resulted in a failure to directly target \nand support young fathers.  Hence, as Caracciolo di Torella (2007: 319) argues in relation to the  \ngovernment, whilst there is some acknowledgement within recent policies that the involvement of \nfathers is crucial to re-conceptualising relations between parents and children, \u201eactual legislative \ndevelopments have been structured with a view to facilitating women's double role of mothers and \nemployees\u201f and have, consequently, failed to challenge the traditional gendered division of labour \n(see also Lister, 2006). \n \nIn the case of teenage parents, part of the problem may be that so little is known about fathers of the \nchildren of teenage mothers.  There has been very little research into the role that they play in their \nchildren\u201fs upbringing and, where studies do reveal a lack of involvement by fathers, it is unclear \nwhether this is intentional, \u201eor simply because they do not know what role to play.\u201f (Hanna, 2001: \n462).  As Coleman and Dennison (1998: 311) highlight, 'It is striking how little consideration is paid to \nthe place of the partner in the consideration of teenage parenthood.  Most writers on this subject \ncontribute to the overall impression that young fathers are either invisible or absent.' This is despite \nthe fact that recent research not only suggests that large numbers of teenage fathers do play a role \non the upbringing of their children, but also that the positive involvement of fathers can contribute to \nchildren\u201fs well-being (e.g. Bunting & McAuley, 2004; and Coleman & Dennison, 1998).  It is, of \ncourse, crucial to recognise that not all teenage mothers are in a position to experience positive \nsupport from partners; some may enter parenthood as single mothers and others may experience \nunwanted interference, even violence, from their partners.  Policies which aim to support young \nparents and their children therefore need to offer a range of different kinds of support to a variety of \npotential family situations.  What Case Study 1 suggests is that, as part of this flexibility, interventions \nwhich aim to support young parents ought to consider the potential benefits that offering targeted \nsupport to young fathers, in addition to that offered to young mothers, may bring. \n \nIn the second case study, the active encouragement for unemployed fathers to undertake childcare \ntraining with a view to pursuing careers in childcare was not the result of a policy designed to \nchallenge traditional gender roles.  Rather, the aim of the intervention was to help workless members \nof the community to move from welfare into work.  Unfortunately, the gender-blind way in which the \nintervention was rolled out meant that, despite the apparent ability of the men involved to negotiate \ntheir gender identities positively in relation to childcare, there was an absence of any attempt to \nsupport the men in this or to tackle the gendered perceptions of childcare that the participants \nencountered in the broader community. This is an important gap because, whilst not necessarily \nsetting out to purposefully recruit men into non-traditional gender roles, in the context of the labour \nmarket landscape of this region of the UK, it is unsurprising both that working age men were one of \nthe target groups and that the demand for jobs was in a sector traditionally associated with women.  \nGiven that others areas of the UK share some of the characteristics of the labour market in the North-\nEast of England (Turok & Webster, 1998), it is likely that other interventions designed to tackle \nworklessness may also encourage men to consider undertaking work that has been traditionally \nassociated with women. \n \nThe potential damage caused by \u201egender-blind\u201f policies has already been noted by a number of \nresearchers.  However, there has been a tendency within some of this work to equate \u201egender-blind\u201f \nwith \u201emale-centred\u201f.  Not only does this imply that men automatically benefit from gender-blindness, it \nalso suggests that the category of \u201emen\u201f, or \u201emale\u201f, represents one, homogenous group.  Yet, as the \nwealth of work on masculinities highlights (Clare, 2001; Connell, 1995; Hearn & Pringle, 2006; \nJackson, 1991; McDowell, 2003a, 2003b), masculine identities are multiple and fluid.  Hence, it is \nimportant not to assume that policy biases which favour some men in some situations will necessarily \nfavour all men in all situations.  What we are therefore arguing in favour of is not merely the need for \npolicies to pay more attention to the specific difficulties facing some socially excluded men but for \npolicymakers to consciously and consistently reflect on the potential impact of all social policies on \ngender relations.  This is likely to be important for more women than men (Lister, 2006; MacLeavy, \n2007) but, nevertheless, men cannot be ignored, both because the possibility of truly challenging \nunequal gender relations requires their participation and because the life-experiences of men are \nfrequently intertwined with those of their families (McIlwaine & Datta, 2003). \n The Labour government is far from unaware of the importance of gender to employment and social \npolicy.  Indeed, a publication by the Social Exclusion Unit (1999) directly suggest that policy \nresponses to some social problems need to be more sensitive to gender issues and the recent \nEquality Bill (2008) demonstrates a continuing awareness of the need for gender parity.  \nUnfortunately, however, the case studies presented here, combined with the work of others (e.g. \nHague et al., 2001; Lister, 2006; MacLeavy, 2007), suggest that such an approach remains \naspirational.  All this lends support both to Watson\u201fs (1999: 2) argument that there is an \u201eurgent need \nto firmly reintroduce and re-emphasise the importance of gender to the social policy debate\u201f and to \nRake\u201fs (2000: 107) claim that policy mechanisms \u201ewould be greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a \nthorough audit of policy for its impact on gender.\u201f \n \nReferences \nAndrew, A.
