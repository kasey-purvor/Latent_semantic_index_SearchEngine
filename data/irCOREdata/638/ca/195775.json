The archaeology of more recent periods, however, \nremains largely neglected;  such work as has been undertaken has tended to be framed simply in terms of an \n\u201eIslamic\u201f archaeology, in succession to a \u201eChristian\u201f medieval archaeology.  What this paper wishes to explore \nis the possibility of developing some rather different approaches to the archaeology of the postmedieval and \nmore recent periods in the Sudanese Middle and Upper Nile.   Drawing on methodological and theoretical \napproaches being developed in the practice of \u201ehistorical archaeology\u201f in other parts of the world (e.g. Andr\u00e9n \n1998, Falk 1991, Funari et al 1998) it will discuss a few possible areas where research might be directed and \nsome of the possibilities for developing more fruitful dialogue between history and archaeology.  At this time \nwe are still very much talking of the potential for future work.  However, within one regional research \nprogramme, still ongoing in the Nubian Third Cataract region of northern Sudan, it is proving possible to \nbegin to explore some of the potential of historical archaeology, with encouraging results. \n \nIf we choose to look beyond traditional religion-based periodisations, one possible line for the development of \nresearch is to begin to explore some of the concerns of  historical archaeology, as practiced in other parts of \nthe world.  There is clearly considerable potential, for example, for developing research concerned with the \npostmedieval spread of Europe and its values, the development of capitalism and \u201emodernity\u201f.   If we wish to \navoid the Eurocentrism (apparent in many definitions of the scope of historical archaeology), we also need to \nlook at the specific local contexts and particularities of the history of the Middle Nile.  What may be termed \n\u201ecapitalist\u201f forces were certainly an important element of the intrusive institutions and social forces which were \nto destroy the Sinn\u0101r Sultanate during the eighteenth century (Spaulding 1985: xiii-xiv).  However, the \nappearance of these forces and the growth of more general global linkages during the postmedieval period \nwere not however initially through European contacts.  Instead they came through the great powers of the Near \nEast, notably the Ottoman Empire, while new intellectual links were mediated through Islamic traditions, \nentering the Middle Nile from a number of directions.  The slow infiltration of coin and the growth of \nmonetary economies were also rooted within long-established regional trading traditions. When the first steps \ntowards modernization, \u201eimprovement\u201f, and small-scale industrialization were made in the nineteenth century, \nthey were mediated through exploitative policies of the colonial government of the Turkiyya, inspired in turn \nby the policies for modernizing Egypt of Muhammed Ali and his successors.  \n \nIf historical archaeology may suggest new areas of research for us, its theory and methods may also have \nsignificant implications for the practice of archaeology in the region, not least in promoting an active concern \nfor, and dialogue with, historical research.  One aspect of such concern is to encourage an interest in and much \ngreater use of what are potentially considerable resources, largely untapped by archaeologists.  For many parts \nof the Middle Nile, for example, we have a wealth of ethnographic accounts.  Many have a significant \nhistorical component; often dating back more than a century, they may also be valuable historical documents \nin their own right.  While these are often closely linked to colonial rule during the Condominium, there are \nalso some useful earlier accounts, both by early European travellers, as well as rare Arab and Ottoman \nsources. Perhaps more important, however, we also have the possibility  to look beyond the written word and \nexplore the potential of oral traditions, historical sources which have come to occupy such an important place \nin Africanist history in recent decades (Vansina 1985).  While these have been used to great effect in a number \nof historical studies in the Sudan (e.g. Ewald 1985), they have yet to figure in any significant way in \narchaeological research in the region.   \n \nThe value of oral traditions is enhanced where they may both supplement and challenge written sources.  What \nmay be termed \u201eOrientalist\u201f traditions of textual scholarship (which have been almost totally focused on \nArabic sources)  have been criticized for the partial and incomplete view of the postmedieval history of Sudan \nwhich they create (e.g. Spaulding and Kapteijns 1991), not least in excluding large numbers of \u201eSudanese\u201f \nwho did not aspire to, or qualify for, \u201eArab\u201f identities.  This is an area where studies of alternative historical \nsources, working with archaeology, would also seem to have considerable potential for developing very \ndifferent histories of relations of power and identity.  They may be especially valuable in relating to recent \ncenturies, the time in which the \u201emaster narratives\u201f of cultural and social identity of the modern Sudan were \nbeing forged (Johnson 1997, 2003). Oral traditions may provide a means through which the complexities of \nrace, identity and social status may be explored, reaching beyond, for example, the written genealogies which \nFinal draft \n \n 2 \nestablished \u201eArab\u201f ancestry and identities for a wide range of \u201enorthern\u201f Sudanese.  Since the Condominium, \nsuch genealogies have been one major focus of  Sudanese historiography  (e.g. MacMichael 1922; Hasan \n1967) as well as being hugely influential in forging more popular perceptions of Sudanese history.   \n \nListening to local voices may also prove useful in directing research interests in other directions which have \ncome to figure large in many areas of historical archaeology, such as the exploration of issues of domination \nand resistance (e.g. Miller et al. 1995; Funari et al 1999).  Issues such as these have begun to be explored by \nhistorians and anthropologists of the Middle Nile, concerned especially with the \u201eperipheries\u201f during the \npostmedieval and more recent periods.  \n \nIslamic Archaeology or Historical Archaeology? \nTraditional approaches to the more recent history and archaeology of the region have, to date, largely been \nframed around a perceived Christian-Islamic divide.  However, this seems increasingly inadequate on a \nnumber of counts.  At a general level, such an approach would seem to fail to reflect the richness and diversity \nof the many histories of the Middle Nile, regional and local, of the last 1000 years.  While the spread of Islam \nin the Sudan is certainly a key theme which needs to be explored during the postmedieval period, it cannot be \nrestricted to that period as it was a process which began much earlier, during the medieval period (el-Zein \n2000).  We may also question the extent to which religion may be the most appropriate way of defining this \nperiod and organizing our master narratives.  The ways in which Islam was to transform the Middle Nile \nshould really be the object of our investigations, rather than being taken for granted as the definitive \ncharacteristic of the postmedieval period.  The more recent history of the Sudan cannot fail to remind us that \neven today, Islam defines the identity of by no means all of its citizens, and often in very different ways;  Islam \nitself may be manifested in many different ways.  Similarly, the extent to which Christianity was the defining \ncharacteristic of medieval (\u201eChristian\u201f) culture, even within the core riverine regions of the Middle Nile, is an \narea of research which clearly requires further examination (Edwards 1999, 2001).  \n \nRather than framing research simply in terms of an \u201eIslamic Archaeology\u201f, a number of different approaches to \nthe archaeology of the last 500 years may be possible.  The traditional political periodisations may well prove \nuseful in structuring our research, exploring the archaeology of the Funj Sultanate dominating much of central \nSudan, the Kayra Sultanate lying to the west in Darfur, and the Ottoman Empire extending into northern \nNubia, as well as along parts of the Red Sea littoral. In the nineteenth century we then have the imposition of \nthe Turco-Egyptian colonial government over much of the region, followed by that of the Mahdiyya, which \nsurvived until 1899.  These units were in turn surrounded by numerous smaller-scale societies on their \nmargins.  Addressing other themes and long-term processes may also be possible, however, cutting across \nthese periodisations.  Amongst these, the spread of Islam will be only one of several. \n \nIn view of the shear scale of the Sudan, comprehensive large-scale studies of these periods are unlikely to be \nachievable in the forseeable future.  However one way forward is to develop local and regional research \nprograms, combining archaeological and historical research but with an explicit concern to locate local \nhistories within their wider context, and relate them to larger historical issues.  From its origins in the \nchronicles and histories of the literate religious and political elites of the Funj period, Sudanese historiography \nremains heavily biased towards the centres of power, especially the central riverine region.   Historical \narchaeology has the potential to move beyond the limitations of written sources to begin to reclaim some of \nthe complexity of the numerous and diverse histories both within and around the major kingdoms. \n \nThe Funj and their neighbours \nAs yet, we have very little knowledge of the archaeology of central Sudan during the Funj period (Crawford \n1951).  The little data we have relating to \u201eFunj\u201f material culture is limited to a small amount of material, \nlargely pottery, from early excavations at Abu Geili (Crawford and Addison 1951). Many fundamental \nquestions remain unanswered, however, not least concerning the extent to which this material, from close to \nSinn\u0101r, is really representative of the Funj domains as a whole.   Some potentially similar material has been \nreported from the Abdallab centre at Qarr\u012b, near the Sixth Cataract (al-Sanjak 1978), but we really still in no \nposition to judge whether there existed a specific style of  \u201eFunj pottery\u201f which was widespread across the \nSultanate.   We are even more ignorant of the material evidence for the opening of Sinn\u0101r to contacts with the \n\u201eoutside world\u201f, a process which has begun to be studied on the basis of historical records (e.g. Spaulding \n1985), but is otherwise known only from occasional reports of glass shards and glazed pottery on the surface \nof postmedievals sites.  Even the major urban centres of the Funj Sultanate, Sinn\u0101r and Arbaj\u012b, remain largely \nunexplored. We possess some contemporary descriptions of Sinn\u0101r and some sketchy reports of the site \n(Fitzenreiter 2000) but Arbaj\u012b remains all but unknown.  A brief survey in the 1970s suggested that the \nsettlement may have covered 7-8 hectares and had a substantial qubba cemetery associated with it (Khalifa \nFinal draft \n \n 3 \n1979).  However the site is now reported to have almost entirely disappeared beneath modern cultivation and \nsettlement. \n \nBeyond the western margins of the Funj in Kordofan, the other great power of the period was located in \nDarfur under the Kayra Fur sultans (O\u201fFahey 1980). Beyond preliminary studies of some of the more \nimpressive architectural monuments of the region (see Reed 1994 for one of the more recent) we still know \nvery little of the archaeology of this period in Western Sudan, although McGregor (2001) has recently \nprovided a useful synthesis of existing data linked with a study of oral traditions and histories of the region.  \nAs in the Funj domains, we have a number of potentially valuable historical studies of  long-distance trade into \nthe region from the sixteenth century (O\u201fFahey 1971; Walz 1978, 1979). \n \nOne area where the beginnings of a postmedieval archaeology have begun to be established is in northern \nriverine Nubia.  By the mid-sixteenth century, Nubia north of the Third Cataract was dominated by the \nOttoman Empire, which established frontier garrisons  there as well as its own regional administration.  Recent \nwork is now highlighting the extent to which this period was probably crucial to the formation of modern \nNubian identities, not least in the apparent isolation of much of northern Nubia from the Funj state, and many \nof the socio-political and religious developments taking place in central Sudan during this period.  John \nAlexander\u201fs work on the Ottoman archaeology of Nubia over the last decade (Alexander 1994, 1995, 1997, \n2000)  has really for the first time begun to explore the postmedieval period with an explicit concern for wider \nhistorical context.  As such, we are beginning to get some idea of the complexities of local cultural \ndevelopments within Ottoman Nubia as well as their relationship to larger historical processes at work within \nthe Ottoman Empire.  It now seems likely, for example, that the material remains of  Ottoman garrisons such \nas those at  Qasr Ibrim and Sai, far from being representative of \u201eIslamic-period Nubia\u201f as a whole, actually \nrelate to very specific military communities, which formed only one element of a complex tapestry of different \npopulations and identities. \n \nWhile some of the more salient features of the archaeology of the Ottomans in Nubia are now beginning to \nemerge, the relationship of Ottoman Nubia to areas further south still remains far from clear. Historical \nsources suggest that the southern end of the Third Cataract region, at Hannek, became a de facto frontier \nbetween the Ottomans and the Funj and later rulers of the Dongola Reach.  However, how the Funj presence in \nthe Dongola Reach was marked materially is still unknown, while oral traditions suggest that the Ottomans to \nthe north may have influenced both the cataract region, and areas further south (See also el-Zein this volume). \n \nArchaeology and Islamic holymen \nThe spread and growing influence of Islamic holymen is one of the dominant themes of the postmedieval \nhistory of the Sudan, marked by the settlements which grew up around them and their qubba tombs, \npotentially new \u201eIslamic\u201f settlement landscapes and new landscape of religious power. These same \nindividuals, as the historians and chroniclers of their society, have also played a fundamental role in the \nconstruction of northern Sudanese historical consciousness through their written legacy, notably compilations \nof biographies of religious notables such as the  Kit\u0101b al-Tabaq\u0101t of Wad Dayf Allah.  These have in turn \nbecome primary sources for more general historical studies of the period (e.g. McHugh 1994; Spaulding \n1985).   \n \nHowever, many questions about the religious enclaves which grew up around these holymen still remain to be \naddressed. To what extent were they new foundations? How did their development change existing settlement \nlandscapes?  The origin of most of these religious centres remains far from clear. Ed Damer, for example, rose \nto prominence in the eighteenth century as the centre of the Majdhubiyya tariqa, who enjoyed a great \nreputation and wielded considerable power in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (e.g. \nBurckhardt 1819).  While their accumulation of estates and followers in the area can be traced in historical \ndocuments (Spaulding 1985), how they related to existing communities remains far from clear and, as with \nmost of such sites, no archaeological investigations have been undertaken to explore their early histories. Only \nin rare cases do we have even basic descriptions of such sites, such as Abu Haraz on the Blue Nile (e.g. al-\nHassan 1978).  Old Dongola is a rare example of a site where we may trace some kind of continuity between \nthe medieval period, when it was the capital Christian kingdom of Makuria, and its emergence as the seat of a \nnumber of notable Islamic teachers and holymen.  The details of this transition are still far from clear, although \nthe material marks of this new class of Islamic notables is very apparent in the great qubba cemetery of Old \nDongola. \n \nThe appearance of the such qubba monuments associated with Islamic sheikhs is a widespread phenomenon, \nlocal manifestations of similar historical processes underway in many parts of the Middle Nile.  Their \nFinal draft \n \n 4 \nimportance as early monuments to the spread of Islam is increasingly well-recognised and some work has \nbegun on their recording and description (e.g. el-Zein 1987).  However, from what we currently know of their \ndistribution it seems likely that there is much more to be learnt from their systematic study as part of broader \nhistorical investigations.  Most obviously, the spread of such monuments across northern and central Sudan \nappears quite uneven.  They are, for example, prominent features of parts of the northern Dongola Reach and \nfurther north, as well as being found in many of the religious enclaves of the more open landscapes of the \nGezira and central Sudan (McHugh 1994; el-Zein 1987). By contrast, in other areas however, north of the \nAtbara and in the Rubatab, for example (Ahmed el-Mutassim pers. comm.) they seem to be largely unknown.  \n \nExisting written sources on their own can throw little light on such patterns.  The biographies contained in the \nTabaq\u0101t , for example, are very much biased to a relatively limited area of central Sudan.  If their \ngeographical coverage is uneven, what they also do not record are the histories of a myriad of lesser religious \nfigures, many of whom never enjoyed more than local reputations.  As such, for large numbers of religious \nfoci we have no significant written histories at all.  In such cases, archaeological studies working with the \ncollection of oral traditions seem our best chance of  throwing light on the histories of these holymen, at the \nregional and local level.   \n \nWithin the Third Cataract region, for example, recent survey has identified numerous qubba tombs and \nassociated monuments to local fuqara, in some 20 qubba cemeteries (fig. 1). These range in date from the \nrelatively recent, relating to individuals whose histories are well-known, to others who are fading into near \nmythical status, their names largely forgotten.  While certainly interesting as monuments, they, and traditions \nassociated within them provide numerous insights into the social and religious world of the region over several \ncenturies, as well as an interesting counterpoint to the more official histories of the centres of power in the \ncentral Sudan. The major written historical sources, with their central Sudanese bias, have highlighted the way \nin which many fuqara of northern origin, including a number of Mahasi Nubians, founded many of the \nreligious enclaves of central Sudan, notably among the Blue Nile.  Such Mahas migrations to central Sudan \nare now a well-established part of conventional histories, represented by communities claiming Mahas origins, \nand links with Mahasi fuqara and their monuments (Lobban 1984).  One of the more famous early figures was \nIdris wad al-Arbab, who died in the mid-seventeenth century.  Typically, his reputation for piety is credited \nwith attracting settlers to his home at Aylafun, creating an unusually large village at its Blue Nile site.  His \nqubba tomb remains an important pilgrimage centre to this day.   \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Qubba Faq\u012br Arabi, Habarab al-Mahas. \n \nBack in his Mahas homeland, however, oral traditions are beginning to reveal some local histories which \ncomplement the stories of such high-profile individuals.  Mobility is one common theme; interesting in itself \nwhen we may be predisposed to imagine conservative and deeply rooted Nubian peasant communities.   \nVirtually every local faki of the Mahas region would seem to be an immigrant of one form or another, if only \nfrom village a few miles away.  Many, hoever, may be credited with a non-Mahas origin, perhaps coming from \none of the religious schools (khalwas) to the south in the Dongola Reach, or the Shendi Reach, or more rarely \nfrom outside the Sudan, from Egypt, Arabia, or even West Africa.   For every \u201esuccessful\u201f individual \nFinal draft \n \n 5 \nemigrating from the Mahas, making a reputation and founding a centre of religion in central Sudan, there were \nothers moving within the region, as well as non-Mahas immigrants arriving, settling and becoming Mahas.   \nLocal followings were also secured, but not of a type to earn a mention in the Tabaq\u0101t.  We have, for example, \na series of  ancient qubbas and shrines at Shadda (fig. 2), in the central part of the Mahas, reputed to have \nbeen a centre of pilgrimage for the whole region in the nineteenth century and probably long before.  The \nidentities of the holymen buried there however, interestingly known only by Nubian names, are now no longer \nclear. \n \nFig.2 Early tomb of Mahas holyman (\u2018Martinassi\u2019) at Shadda \n \nOral traditions may also, on occasions, add something to the canonical written sources.  It is noticeable that \nthe original homes of so many of the great holymen seem not to have been recorded for posterity. While a \nMahas origin and genealogy may be noted, links with specific places do not seem to be have been recorded, or \nat least do not seem to have made it into the histories.  Within the local traditions of the Mahas region, these \nemigrants are also rarely visible, although we occasionally catch a glimpse of some of them. Within the \ngeneral archaeology we may also begin to something of the background from which they came.  One local \ntradition, for example, suggests that Idris wad al-Arbab\u201fs family may be linked with a settlement at Jebel \nKadamusa, just north of the Third Cataract (Edwards and Osman 2000). Following recent work, this site \nemerges as a potentially very interesting, and certainly unusual settlement, displaying a distinctive range of \nvery late medieval\/early postmedieval material culture, as well as an apparently Islamic cemetery with unusual \ntomb forms. The available dating evidence would also place its occupation probably in the fifteenth, or early \nsixteenth centuries.  As yet this is one of the very few sites in the region which currently can be dated to this \nperiod in which the first Mahas fuqara were appearing in the central Sudan, but suggests there may be scope \nfor investigating the origins of such diaporas. \n \n \nTurkiyya \nAnother area we may consider is the archaeology of the Turkiyya, the Turco-Egyptian colonization and rule of \nthe Middle Nile from 1820 to 1885.  This period is of central importance in the development of the modern \nSudanese state, in beginning processes of geographical expansion and definition which established the form of \nthe modern state.  The period also sees the Middle Nile becoming engaged, really for the first time, in \nprocesses of \u201emodernization\u201f.  At one level we can identify processes of global capitalist development \nimpinging on the region. At the same time, however, this global framework may be balanced by the presence \nof the Ottoman Empire which, even at this late date, still retained some of its influence as \u201eits own World \nEmpire\u201f (Baram and Carroll 2000).  \n \nEconomic changes were also being accompanied by new forms of government and order.  While the \nexploitative character of Egyptian rule has been quite well documented (e.g Bj\u00f8rkelo 1983), that this should \nnot be seen as a purely local, colonial phenomena could be further explored.  The experience of the Sudan \nduring the nineteenth century cannot really be detached from larger-scale processes effecting Egypt, and the \nOttoman Empire as a whole, during this period.  From the later eighteenth century the increasing incorporation \nof Egypt into European world trade was becoming evident (Crecelius 1981), and by the early nineteenth \nFinal draft \n \n 6 \ncentury Egypt was largely producing commodities, notably cotton, for European consumption.  Muhammed \nAli, conqueror of the Sudan , was also instigator of far-ranging series\u201f of  \u201emodernizing\u201f social and economic \nreforms in Egypt (Mitchell 1988, ch.2).  The period which saw the colonization of Sudan was also one of a \nnew engagement of government in the processes of production. In Egypt, these were replacing earlier models \nwhich had been largely extractive, with attempts to \u201cdiscipline, coordinate and increase what were now \nthought of as the \u201eproductive powers\u201f of the country\u201d (Mitchell 1988: 35).  Across Egyptian society, new \ndisciplinary mechanisms were appearing, building on military reforms - the nizam jadid, the \u201enew order\u201f - \nbegun at the same time as the conquest of the Sudan.  With the Egyptian conquest, historical records improve \nmarkedly. There is increasing official documentation  as well as unofficial accounts from a small but growing \nband of foreign observers, notably Europeans working for the government or making their way as adventurers, \noften engaged in trade of one form or another (Santi and Hill 1980). \n \nTurkish rule also had a considerable impact on the settlement landscapes of the region, with the founding or \nrevival of settlements as regional and local administrative centres, military bases and trading and market \ncentres.  However, as yet there has been little attempt to record or investigate the built-heritage of this period, \nalthough some early interest was shown by O.G.S Crawford (1953).  Much of what remains is fast being \neroded; one notable provincial example is the town of Al-Khandaq, in the Dongola Reach (el-Zein 2000).  \nLargely depopulated today, the abandoned shell of the nineteenth century town is still an imposing monument \nto the Turco-Egyptian government of the nineteenth century, but is fast decaying.  Its mosque which remains \nlargely intact is a rare example of early nineteenth century mosque architecture.   \n \nLocal manifestations of this period are clearly highly variable. In more isolated regions the government \npresence may often have been slight.  Written sources, however may not be very informative, and local studies \nare required to further investigate this.  Areas of Nubia north of the Third Cataract, in the Mahas region, very \nrarely appear in histories of this period.  The local population had offered no resistance to the initial invasion \nof Ismail Pashas army in 1820-21 and subsequently remaining relatively isolated from most of the major \npolitical dramas of the period, as a relatively thinly populated rural area.  In histories of the Turkiyya (e.g. Hill \n1959), northern Nubia rarely appears except as lying on the route between Egypt and central and southern \nSudan.  However, current work is beginning to expose what appear to be often turbulent local histories during \nthis period which actually have much in common with those of better-researched areas of central Sudan.  Some \nofficial presence seems to have been installed at Kokke, the seat of the Mahas Mek. This is represented by a \nlarge fortified compound (diffi), known locally as the \u201eEshlaag\u201f, built close to the \u201epalace\u201f diffi of the local \nMahas meks.  Beside it a mosque was built (fig. 3), reputedly the oldest in the region, dated by one inscription \nto 1828-99 (fig. 4). \n \nFig.3. Turkish Mosque, Kokke \n \n \nFinal draft \n \n 7 \n \nFig.4. Turkish inscriptions from the Kokke mosque \n \n \nIn other parts of the Middle Nile we may find evidence for the concerns of the government to be engaged with \nthe processes of production, with a number of initiatives of both direct and indirect involvement in promoting \neconomic activity.  Early industrial ventures included soapworks, indigo workshops and gold washings, \nnotable examples of the latter were the gold extraction plants established up the Blue Nile at the end of the \n1830s.  Another prominent area of government economic policy may be found in the encouragement of \nindigo-growing and processing, following Muhammed Ali\u201fs establishment of a government monopoly in 1824.  \nIn Egypt, Armenian specialists were imported from Bengal to oversee the development of new factories. \n(Balfour-Paul 1997) and factories had certainly been established in the Sudan by the 1830s. As in Egypt, \nfarmers were forced to cultivate indigo, along with other crops like cotton.  As in Egypt, these measures \ninspired huge resentment and often active resistance.  Desertion of the land and even revolts was a common \nproblem in Egypt (Rivlin 1961) as it was in central Sudan (Bj\u00f8rkelo 1983). \n \nThe location of a number of the nineteenth century indigo factories can be established from documentary, \nalthough more detailed information on them is scarce.  While apparently more common in central Sudan, a \nnumber were established in the north, in the Dongola Reach. The presence of one indigo factory was noted at \nal-Khandaq in 1834 (Santi and Hill 1980: 45) while another, probably the northernmost in the Sudan was \noperating at Mushu, just south of the Third Cataract (Hoskins 1835).  An \u201eindustrial archaeology\u201f of such \nenterprises is still to begin. \n \nIf the Turkish government made relatively little positive impact on the local economy of the Mahas region, the \nmore general influx of Egyptian and other minor craftsmen in the wake of the Turco-Egyptian army does seem \nto be reflected in a number of families of craftsmen and traders who arrived in the region in the nineteenth \ncentury.  One of these was a family of potters whose descendants were still active in the late twentieth century.  \nWorking as travelling craftsmen, they seem to have been able to meet most of the local needs for pottery over \nmost of the Mahas and Sikoot area. Their assimilation into the Mahas community, becoming Nubian-speaking \nand effectively becoming Mahas (although not acquiring land rights) also provides another interesting \nexample of the ever-changing composition of Mahas ethnicity. \n \nAnother area where Mahas Nubia shared in the wider experience of the Middle Nile in this period seems to \nhave been in relation to the an ever-increasing tax burden. The area seems to have suffered from the relatively \nhigh rates of saqia and land tax imposed on Dongola province, markedly higher than those in Berber province \n(Hill 1959: 41).  These new taxes inspired an armed revolt in April 1833, of which we have a near first-hand \naccount provided by Hoskins (1835), an English traveller passing through the area.  While a relatively minor \naffair for the government, significant numbers of Mahasi, running into hundreds, seem to have been killed \nduring its suppression, a loss of life likely to have caused major social disruption in their communities.  About \nthe history of the revolt, its suppression and aftermath, very little information seems to survive in total \ntraditions.  Indeed the identity of its leaders, and where they came from remain unclear, although some links \nwith the local elites and the Mahas mek seems likely.  \n \nAs well as direct resistance, the increased taxation appears to have caused significant disruptions to land-\nholdings during the Turkiyya as elsewhere in the  Sudan.  One effect seems to have been a decline in \ncultivation.  In both Berber Province and Dongola Province there seems to have been a significant decline in \nFinal draft \n \n 8 \nthe number of saqias by the time of the Mahdist revolt.  In Berber numbers may have fallen from an estimated \n3,500-4000 to 3,000, while in Dongola the estimated 5,250 which were worked at the time of the conquest had \ndeclined to some 3,590 by the 1870s (Bj\u00f8rkelo 1983: 143).  No figures exist for the Mahas region, but it is \nunlikely that the region was unaffected by this process.  More generally, the Turkiyya does seem to have been \na period of considerable upheaval and insecurity.   What oral traditions do record is that excessive taxation \nwas responsible for effectively dispossessing many individuals, who were forced to relinquish their claims to \nsaqias for which they couldn\u201ft afford to pay the taxes.  In several instances, while researching settlement \nhistories, we encountered family traditions recording ancestors who had been forced to abandon their lands \nand relocate to found new settlements during this period.  Their lands were often then acquired by others more \nable to meet the tax burden.  It seems likely that in these uncertain times, many families will have prospered \nwhile others were dispossessed.  The latter may have included many who chose to leave their homeland, \njoining the jellaba and other adventurers who were seeking new opportunities on the expanding frontiers of \nthe state. \n \nIt was within this context that we see one of the most prominent markers of this period appearing in the \nsettlement landscape, in the form of fortified diffi houses (fig.5).  These seem to represent a relatively \ndistinctive regional form of architecture, mainly found in Mahas and Sikoot Nubia. While some fortified sites \nare certainly significantly older, it seems that a large proportion of surviving diffi represent houses constructed \nduring the Turkiyya.  As fortified enclosures they probably well-reflect the insecurity of the period.  They may \nalso be seen as relating to those who still managed to survive and perhaps prosper during the Turkiyya.  \nUnlike many, their owners retained enough property to warrant such protection.  Why they are such a feature \nof the Mahas-Sikoot landscapes and not other areas of northern Sudan as yet remains unclear.  That their \ndistribution falls very much within the Ottoman frontier zone may well be significant and needs further \ninvestigation. \n \nFig.5. 19\nth\n century Diffi in Mashakeila (Mahas) \n \nWhether this period saw other significant changes to the composition of local communities remains less clear. \nThis may also have been the period where slaves were becoming more abundant in the region as slave-trading \nand slave-owning became more widespread, although soldiers and other household slaves seem to have been \npresent among the Kokke \u201ekings\u201f and others of the local elite in earlier times.   Hoskin\u201fs account of the Mahas \nrevolt in 1833 notes the presence of many slaves, or ex-slaves, among prisoners captured by the government \nforces (1833:241)  and they also figure in other early accounts of the region, such as Burckhardt\u201fs (1819).  \nRecent work has also identified a number of communities of ex-slaves, liberated at the start of the \nCondominium (Muhammed Jelaal pers.comm).  \n \nThe issue of slaves may in turn draw us to other interesting questions relating to the fast-expanding trading and \nother networks developing during the Turkiyya.  Following the final collapse of the Funj state, the Turco-\nEgyptian government was responsible for major changes in trading relations in the region, especially with \nregard to the Upper Nile.  While the eighteenth century seems to have seen the final erosion of  the royal \nmonopolies on long-distance trade (Spaulding 1985), the new regime brought new trading imperatives linking \nin to ever wider world markets, as well as government attempts to assert new controls on trading activities.  \nFinal draft \n \n 9 \nThe expansion of such activities into southern Sudan was one major development following the exploratory \nvoyages made up the White Nile by Sal\u012bm Qap\u016bd\u0101n during 1839-42, which seem primarily to have been \ninterested in assessing the commercial possibilities of the region.  However, as the century progressed, private \ntrading expeditions greatly increased, in the hands of growing numbers of northern jellaba traders,  many \nencouraged to seek new opportunities on the state\u201fs peripheries due to repressive conditions at home, as well \nas small numbers of European adventurers, interested mainly in slaves and ivory.  With attempts to control the \nslave trade during the later nineteenth century, the major exports were increasingly ivory and gum Arabic, \nwhile textiles (\u201eManchester Goods\u201f) seem to have been the major import (Santi and Hill 1980: 3),  reflecting \nchanging conditions in Egypt. \n \nTrade up the White Nile was operating in a non-monetary market and beads seem to have been the primary \nexchange item, although cowries also acted as a form of currency in some areas, as in Kordofan. As in other \nparts of Africa, the appearance of a wide range of  new \u201efashion items\u201f along the Upper Nile is likely to be the \nmost obvious indicator of the huge quantities of ivory extracted during the nineteenth century (Lonsdale \n1992).  Large quantities of imported beads, mainly from European factories seem likely to have transformed \n\u201etraditional\u201f bead usage in the Upper Nile.  Rare first-hand accounts of the mid-nineteenth century, such as \nthat of  J.-A. de Vaissi\u00e8re (Santi and Hill 1980)  give us some insights into the variety of trade beads, as well \nas their exchange value: an elephant tusk might be had for 2 pound of blue glass beads and 4-5 pounds of glass \ntrinkets along the Upper White Nile in the mid-1850s.   \n \nSome of the significance of beads in this region in the more recent past has already begun to be explored in \nethno-archaeological studies (Kleppe 1982, 1986).  It s certainly an area of research with considerable \npotential for development, for example in tracing longer-term patterns within the bead culture of the Upper \nNile.  Something of the \u201etrajectory of meanings\u201f followed by trade goods can be seen in action during the \nnineteenth century.  De Vaissi\u00e8re observed in early 1854 at one stop on a trading voyage:  \u201cthere has been a \npopular revulsion against glass beads. The matrons and local lordlings have decided that glass beads, \npreviously cherished as fashionable, were no longer good taste. This means that we have as good as nothing to \noffer them in exchange of tusks ..\u201d (Santi and Hill 1980: 142).  As more traders entered the Upper Nile region, \ndifferent types of beads swiftly passed from the highly desirable back to the realm of more everyday things, \nlosing their value as goods for barter. From a longer-term perspective, some of these nineteenth century trade \ngoods may have continued to play a role into recent times. Among some Dinka groups, for example, antique \n\u201eguen-jang\u201f beads, types \u201cselling during the Turkish Rule\u201d have maintained a considerable value as items of \npersonal property: \u201csince its source of production have become extinct it has become so precious that no one \ncan correctly state its value\u201d (Makec 1986: 129). \n \nElsewhere we get hints of differing local tastes, suggestive in terms of the material representation of identity \nduring this period.  De Vaissi\u00e8re also recorded how:  \u201cthe Galla [?Mangala] ask for round, red glass beads, \ncowries .. the people of the Lokkaia mountains want instead bracelets of red leather and dada of the kind \ncalled franji, while the Bilin ask only for keri or round, black and white, glass beads..\u201d (Santi & Hill 1980: \n150).  The great importance of personal adornment as markers of social identities has previously been \ndiscussed by Mack (1982) amongst others.  It is interesting to reflect, however, on the extent to which \nimported trade goods, especially beads, may have vastly enhanced the possibilities for personal decoration \nduring the nineteenth century. Changing styles of \u201etraditional\u201f Lotuxo or Didinga coiffure, for example, \ntraceable from the 1860s (Mack 1982) may ultimately be seen as part of networks of relationships linking \nthem with \u201ejellaba\u201f or European traders, all the way back to the Murano bead factory in Venice.  One by-\nproduct of Europeans\u201f insatiable demand for ivory in the nineteenth century may have been an explosion of \nelaboration of personal adornment in these far distant regions. \n \nMahdiyya \nThe Mahdist era (1883-98), which saw the expulsion of Turco-Egyptian colonial government, forms an \ninteresting and potentially distinctive period, one which saw considerable social upheaval as well as economic \nchange, accompanying a political revolution. The strong military character of the Mahdist state also left its \nmarks on the landscapes of the Middle Nile.  The new state order which emerged and was maintained by the \nKhalifa is now commonly represented, and celebrated, as an early manifestation of Sudanese nationalism. \nBehind such popular representations of this period what is often much less apparent is that alternative histories \nmay be found, in many parts of the Middle Nile, of those for whom the Mahdist state was alienating and \noppressive, and a new form of internal colonialism (Johnson 1993, 2003).  Material traces of the Mahdiyya \nstill survive in many parts of the region, if now being fast eroded and they, together with oral traditions, \ncertainly have the potential to provide us with many different histories of this crucial period which still remain \nlargely undocumented. \nFinal draft \n \n 10 \n \nOne obvious feature of the Mahdist period which awaits archaeological investigation is its legacy of military \nsites.  At the centre of the state there are the fortifications in Omdurman \u2013 Khartoum, elements of which still \nsurvive (Fitzenreiter  2000).  To these may be added relatively high-profile sites which often appear in \nhistories of the period, such as the Mahdist gun positions on the Sixth Cataract, still quite well-preserved in the \n1970s (al-Sanjak 1978).  Important garrison settlements also existed in many areas, with notable examples in \nthe north being at (New) Dongola, Firka and Saras.  The one at Dongola is believed to have disappeared \nbetween the modern town, although at least one aerial photograph from the 1930s exists (Edwards 1996).  \nElements of the garrison settlement at Firka may still survive while contemporary photographs may exist; the \nBreasted archive in Chicago, for example, holds a photograph of the \u201edervish village\u201f, apparently still largely \nintact, taken in 1907 (Oriental Institute 2003) \n \nAgain, the possibilities for exploring the archaeology of this period in a more systematic way have become \napparent during recent work in the Third Cataract region.  Field survey has identified a number of  sites which \nseem to have served as Mahdist stations for managing transport and river traffic passing through the Cataract \nregion, linking the northern frontier garrisons with their sources of supply in the Dongola Reach and central \nSudan.  The largest of these was probably the substantial fortification on Jebel Wahaba overlooking the \nKajbar cataract.  This may have been the post of the Mahdist \u201eagent\u201f al-Safi walad Hajj Abdallah in 1886, who \nappears in Babiker Bedri\u201fs  rare first-hand account of this period (Bedri 1961: 52-3), and later Uthm\u0101n al-\nAzraq, according to local tradition.  Within the cataract zone itself are a number of simple stone enclosures \nwhich, according to oral traditions, were part of a system of outposts which provided safe accommodation and \nfodder for passing Ansar.  \n \nAs oral traditions also make clear, in many areas there was considerable local resistance to the Ansar presence \nand especially their requisitions, often leading to bloodshed.  Several areas seem to have seen open fighting \nbetween the local inhabitants and Ansar groups, often with some of the larger diffi serving as defensible \nrefuges.  Fear of Ansar \u201etax-collectors\u201f (e.g. Bedri 1961: 44-5) also encouraged the hiding-away of valuables; \nold storage pits, located in isolated areas, are often linked with this period.  At the local level, traditions \nassociated with individual diffis and their owners also help to show some of the diversity of local experiences \nduring this period.  Some were temporarily abandoned by families, including the Mahas mek, who fled to \nEgypt, only returning after the Reconquest.  More rarely, oral tradition and written accounts of the period \ncome together.  Babiker Bedri recounts an encounter in 1886 with one \u201eFadl Shanb\u016b\u201f in \u201ea village in the \nMahas country west of Dalqu\u201f, whose house with \u201ea spacious yard\u201f was later pillaged by Walad al-Nuj\u016bm\u012b\u201fs \narmy (Bedri 1961: 48).  In 2000, the diffi of Fadol Shambo was identified, still standing in the village of \nTuraa\u201f, near Kokke (fig.6).   \n \n \nFig.6.  Diffi Fadl Shambo - Turaa\u2019 al-Mahas \n \nFinal draft \n \n 11 \nLocal resistance not withstanding, local traditions also recall others who joined the Ansar army, fighting in the \nnorth.  Following the destruction of Walad al-Nuj\u016bm\u012b\u201fs army at Toshka, we also find survivors of his army and \ntheir dependents settling in the region, as is also reported in the Batn el Hajar (Adams 1977: 630-31). \n \nSudanic links \nA rather different feature of the postmedieval period is the incorporation of the region into wider social \nnetworks, not least through a new mobility based on Islamic pilgrimage. Trans-Sudanic routes were one \nimportant element in these networks, bringing parts of central and northern Sudan in contact with populations \nfrom central and western Sudanic Africa. Of these, one important group have been Hausa\/Fulani locally \nknown as \u201eFellata\u201f groups.  Early manifestations of such movements seem likely to have been focused more on \ncaravan routes linking West Africa and Egypt rather than the central Sudan (Levtzion 1986), although some \nWest African \u201eTakruris\u201f may have passed taken more southerly routes through Chad, Darfur and Kordofan.  \nSuch movements seem to have markedly increased during the late nineteenth century, one result being the \nestablishment of significant settlements in a number of localities in central and eastern Sudan, while more \nscattered groups and individuals, popularly labelled \u201eFellata\u201f settled elsewhere (Abu Manga 1999; Yamba \n1995).  Today the Fellata settlements are well-recognised and significant parts of the settlement landscapes in \ncentral Sudan.  The extent to which West African cultural traditions are present are not well-documented.  \nMany Fellata settlements eschew permanent houses, reflecting their status as pilgrims, although there are \nreported cases of  mosques being constructed in the Gezira region in a typical West African style (Herman \nBell pers. comm.; Yamba 1995:74). \n \nAgain, local studies in northern Nubia suggest that even this area was affected by such movements, certainly \nas early as the beginning of the nineteenth century, if not before.  Endemic insecurity during the eighteenth \ncentury seems to encouraged trading caravans to avoid the riverine route through Nubia.  However, it still \nseems to have remained a route, albeit dangerous, for small-scale traffic. We find reports from 1813 of small \ngroups of Takruri pilgrims going north to join Cairo Haj caravans (Burkhardt 1819: 45), some with reputation \nas fuqara.  Such encounters do not seem to have been unique and similar groups were also encountered \npassing Akasha in 1821 by Linant de Bellefonds (1958: 10).  Looking to oral traditions, there are interestingly \nsome indications that some at least of these pilgrims also stopped and settled in the region. Genealogies \nrecently collected in the Third Cataract region (in the village of Mashakeila) include at least one \u201eTakruri\u201f,  \nknown as \u201eUdul\u201f who settled there, and whose tomb still survives, in the hamlet of Udulikki.  \n \nWider global linkages \nWhile the traditional political periodisations may prove useful in organizing some areas of research, there is \nalso potential for looking beyond these to more generalized themes, operating on different time scales.  During \nboth the medieval and post-medieval periods we might choose, for example, to focus on changing agricultural \nregimes in the Middle and Upper Nile, notably with the spread of new crops coming both from the south and \nnorth (Rowley-Conwy 1989; Dirar 1993), as the region became part of new, and increasingly global linkages.  \nWithin a wider African context, some have become incredibly important. Maize, for example seems to have \nentered Africa in a number of different areas, probably appearing first as a niche crop within existing complex \ncropping systems. Through the twentieth century, however, it has developed into a mono-cropping grain staple \nin many countries, although its success within the Sudan in ousting existing staples seems to have been rather \nless than in most other parts of the continent. \n \nWhile such crop histories have yet to receive much attention, we may already identify a few issues which need \nto be pursued.  During the postmedieval period, those parts of Nubia at the extreme southern end of Ottoman \ndomains on the Nile (Alexander 2000) are particularly well-placed for studies of the impact of new crops \nlikely to be entering the Middle Nile, both from Asia and from the New World.  While cobs of maize have \nbeen found in \u201eOttoman\u201f levels at Qasr Ibrim (Rowley-Conwy 1989) we cannot be more precise in suggesting \na date for when this crop first made an appearance in the region, while how significant it may have become \nwithin Nubian agriculture in general, away from the Ottoman military posts, is unknown.  That it developed no \nmore than as a niche crop seems likely, and while still known in the area (Nobiin: makaada) it is rarely eaten.  \nIt was certainly not deemed an appropriate crop to replace existing grains (mainly wheat and sorghum) which \nwere used for making fine flat breads (Nobiin: kisra) which seem to have  been a staple form of food at least \nsince the early first millennium AD.   \n \nThe appearance of maize in other parts of the Sudan may be linked to other historical processes, not \nnecessarily relating to the north.  While recorded in Ethiopia as early as the seventeenth century, it only \nappears to develop as a significant crop in the highlands in the early 1800s, today being its most abundant \ngrain crop.  Other routes may have been followed into more southerly parts of the Sudan. Early travellers' \nFinal draft \n \n 12 \nreports certainly indicate its presence in Sudanese Upper Nile by the mid-nineteenth century.  Unlike northern \nNubia, its presence there seems likely to link into East African developments.  Following its introduction to \nthe east African coast by the Portugese in the sixteenth century, maize seems to have followed caravan routes \ninto the interior, being well-established in garden agriculture of Ugandan kingdoms by the 1860s (McCann \n2001). \n \nAnother significant alien introduction is tobacco, which also seems to have been widely grown, and used, in \nthe region by the early nineteenth century (Burckhardt 1819). By the late nineteenth century it was quite \nwidely grown in central Sudan, in Darfur, Kordofan, the southern Fung and Equatoria, as well as in Nubia \n(Bacon 1948). However, while probably entering the region with the Ottoman army, the history of its use and \ndevelopment as a local crop remains unknown. As yet unrecognized in archaeobotanical research in the Sudan, \nits spread can potentially be traced in the archaeology of clay pipes, known, for example in Ottoman sites in \nthe north, but as yet not the subject of any systematic research. \n \nWe might also look at other important crops such as Okra (Hibiscus esculentus), an important food resource in \nparts of Sudan, and certainly a major element in the Nubian diet (Nobiin: weka) in recent times.  Okra \napparently originated in the \u201eAbyssinian\u201f center of origin of cultivated plants (an area that includes present-\nday Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the eastern, higher part of the Sudan). However, little is known about its early \nhistory and distribution. If certainly present in Egypt by the medieval period, its earlier history there is still \nunclear.  \n \nTracing the history of new foods, and new culinary culture may also reflect on questions surrounding the \ndevelopment of new identities in the region.  The appearance of bread foods in Nubia during the early \nmedieval period seems likely to have gradually displaced long-established use of grain for a repertoire of \nporridge and beer foodstuffs.  It is traceable both in the spread of wheat from Egypt into northern Nubia, as \nwell as the appearance of new ceramic forms associated with the preparation of flat breads\/pancakes, in more \nsoutherly areas, adapted for preparing sorghum breads. In the post-medieval period, such changes may be \nlinked with major political changes with the Funj state during the eighteenth century, where traditional elites \nwere challenged and ultimately displaced by new Islamicised and Arabised elites, whose identities were linked \nwith, among other things, the rejection of alcohol and the traditional beers. An association with a culture of \nwheat (and bread) among a new emerging class of powerful Islamic teachers and holymen was explicitly noted \nby Burckhardt (1819) when visiting central Sudan in the early nineteenth century.  Similar patterns may also \nbe seen elsewhere in Sudanic Africa where the spread of wheat and bread has again been associated with \nArab-Berber influences in the west, favoured by merchants as well as local elites (Lewicki 1974: 39-41) \ndeveloping new identities increasingly linked to Islam. \n \nOver the long-term, this expanding frontier of wheat and bread, spreading from the riverine core has been a \nslow, and still incomplete process; but one with strong political impetus.  Promoted at the expense of \nindigenous Sudanic crops and foodstuffs, this shift is a continuing leitmotif of processes (and rhetoric) of \n\u201eDevelopment\u201f and \u201eModernisation\u201f favoured by those with power, notably the urbanized, and often foreign, \ndecision-makers, while also associated with the highly politicised \u201eIslamicisation\u201f of the modern Sudan \nunderway since the 1990s.  \n \n \nConclusion \nWhile the spread of Islam and its impact on social and political institutions is certainly one key theme in the \narchaeology of the postmedieval period in the Sudan, framing researching in this period as a whole in terms of \nan \u201eIslamic archaeology\u201f is clearly very unsatisfactory.  The spread of Islam in the Sudan, and the \ndevelopment of some of its more distinctively Sudanese manifestations is clearly of great importance, but is \nonly one of many themes, albeit often interconnecting, running through the more recent history of the Middle \nand Upper Niles.  If we focus on Islam, there is certainly much more for archaeologists to do than simply \ndescribe and record \u201eIslamic\u201f monuments.  Instead these may be explored within the context of a range of \nhistorical processes, in terms of shifting patterns in settlement, the development of new foci of religious and \npolitical power, and the development of broader social horizons, both within Africa and beyond.   \n \nThe uneven spread of Islam, and its limited impact on large parts of the Sudan even today may also remind us \nof the need for regional and local archaeologies, which may capture something of the diversity of historical \nexperiences.  As historical archaeologists, working with documentary history as well as oral traditions, we may \nwell produce very different histories, not least those concerned with conflict and resistance to the shifting \npower of the central riverine states.  The need for such regional histories is perhaps most pressing on the \nFinal draft \n \n 13 \nmargins of the states, both to the west and east, but especially in the south of the Sudan, areas still largely \nmarginal to the dominant historical narratives.  However, as we are discovering in Nubia we can also find \nlocal histories, probably repeated in many parts of the riverine \u201ecore\u201f, of resistance both to the colonial rule of \nthe Turkiyya, and by many, to what probably appeared to be a new internal colonialism of the Mahdiyya. \n \nConsiderable other potential certainly exists for developing research in many of the common themes of \nhistorical archaeology currently being explored in other parts of the world.  Archaeology has yet to make any \nsignificant contribution to our understanding of agricultural history in the Sudan, although we know that many \nnew crops were coming into the region, from many directions over an extended period. The development of \nnew trading conditions and new trade networks also remain largely unexplored, while there is certainly the \npotential for an \u201eindustrial archaeology\u201f , linking with the forces for \u201emodernization\u201f and \u201eimprovement\u201f \nwithin the Turco-Egyptian administration. Above all there is a need to establish dialogue between archaeology \nand other forms of historical enquiry.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks are due to my colleagues at the University of Khartoum for fruitful collaboration over many years, and \nfor introducing me to many new and fascinating aspects of Sudanese history; especially to Muhammed Jelaal \nfor his energy and enthusiasm in collecting oral traditions in the Mahas region.
