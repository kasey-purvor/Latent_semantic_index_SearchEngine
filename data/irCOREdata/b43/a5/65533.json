Introduction \nTheory maintains that the mispricing of futures contracts cannot be sustained in the presence of \narbitrage trading by market participants. There is an abundant of empirical evidence regarding \nthe efficiency of well established derivatives markets that operate in developed countries \n(Modest and Sundaresan, 1983, Figlewski, 1984, MacKinlay and Ramaswamy, 1988, Yadav \nand Pope, 1990, B\u00fchler and Kemph, 1995, Dwyer, et al., 1996, Neal, 1996, Tse, 2001). \nHowever, the empirical evidence from emerging or newly established derivatives markets is less \nfrequent.  \nAs in the case of other developed European derivatives exchanges (see for example \nB\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995, who study arbitrage and mispricing for the DAX index futures), \nmarket conditions in the Athens Derivatives Exchange (ADEX) should not allow for large and \nlong-lasting arbitrage opportunities. Sophisticated low cost traders (like market makers and \nlarge institutional traders) should be in the best position to exploit arbitrage opportunities. First, \narbitrageurs can avoid tracking error because both index futures contracts traded are written on \nindices that are narrow and liquid (especially the FTSE\/ASE-20 index). Second, they can \nreplicate the index at favourable levels of transaction costs and within a reasonable span of time, \nminimizing at the same time execution risk in the spot market (see also Tse, 2001, who \nexamines futures index arbitrage for the Dow Jones industrial average). Finally, ADEX is \noperating a fully automated electronic trading system eliminating in this way the execution risk \nin the futures market.  \nThe purpose of this study is to examine the profitability of index futures arbitrage in \norder to provide novel empirical evidence about the efficiency of the recently established \nADEX. The establishment of a well functioning derivatives exchange is very important for the \nGreek capital market since it can improve the overall efficiency and information dissemination \nprocess; it can complete the market, contribute in price discovery and can also attract foreign \ninvestors that can benefit from the (emerging) characteristics of this market (see Alexakis et. al., \n2007).  \n 2\nMany issues that are addressed in this study contribute to our knowledge. First it is \nimportant to investigate whether the relationship between the index futures prices and the \nunderlying stock indices can be described by the cost-of-carry model (Cornell and French, \n1983). It is also of great importance to examine whether futures mispricings can result to \nprofitable arbitrage trading in the presence of market frictions. To the best of our knowledge, \nthis is the first study that directly validates (under market frictions) the index futures market \nefficiency of ADEX using high-frequency data for the period 2002-2004. Specifically, market \nefficiency is examined by analysing the FTSE\/ASE-20 index futures contract, the most liquid of \nthe traded contracts; for completeness we have also consider the FTSE\/ASE Mid-40 index \nfutures which is the second most liquid contract.  \n Prior research has documented that derivative markets are less efficient at their early \ntrading history and that the frequency and the magnitude of mispricings are diminishing over \ntime (see B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995, Dwyer, et al, 1996, and references therein).  Thus a second \ninteresting issue is to examine whether the price discrepancy between the cost-of-carry model \nand the market futures prices becomes less prevalent as time passes (indicating that the market \nbecomes more mature over time).  \nThird, the efficiency of the derivatives market can have implications on the lead-lag \nrelationship, on the hedging effectiveness (risk management) and on the price discovery \nmechanism. For example Lafuente and Novales (2003) discuss the estimation of optimal hedge \nratios when there is discrepancy between the futures market price and its theoretical valuation \naccording to the cost-of-carry model. So the investigation of the market efficiency can be \ninformative and beneficial for market participants in the ADEX.     \nFinally, the interest on the properties and behavior of the ADEX is growing (i.e. \nAlexakis et al., 2007, Kavussanos and Visvikis, 2007, Kenourgios, 2005, and other related \nreferences therein). These empirical studies concentrate on other issues of interest and employ \ndifferent methodologies. Our study contributes to this line of research using a new dataset and \nderives results that are over and above of what has been already seen in the extant literature \nregarding the ADEX1.  \n 3\nOur primary results lead to the conclusion that index futures contracts offer profitable \narbitrage opportunities, especially to low cost traders (like market makers and large institutional \ntraders). The futures contracts present similar mispricing rates with transactions and closing data \nand they also exhibit cyclical mispricing patterns2, evidence that complies with the findings of \nEvnine and Rudd (1985). We show that the frequency and magnitude of the futures mispricings \nremain the same even when stock index trading is delayed for at least 30 minutes3. We also \nextend the Gay and Jung (1999) theoretical model to account for the cost of borrowing stocks \nand for index tracking error. Despite introducing additional market frictions, we can still \nobserve profitable arbitrage opportunities. At the end, using regression analysis, we identify \nadditional factors that can explain the mispricing rates, such as time to maturity and market \nanticipated and unanticipated volatility. \n The ADEX development is in accordance to other developed European markets \n(Kenourgios, 2005). In addition, investors in Greece have become more aware of derivatives \ntrading as evidenced from the increase in the volume of futures contracts. Despite this, arbitrage \nopportunities are still very large and persistent indicating that the market does not exhibit a \nmaturation effect like other European derivatives markets (see B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995). Our \nresults indicate that for the period under investigation the ADEX has not attracted the attention \nof highly specialist and sophisticated traders that can act as arbitrageurs. We conjecture that \nmost probably the market is dominated by the trading activities of hedgers4 (similar conclusions \nare conjectured by Kavussanos and Visvikis, 2007, and Alexakis et al., 2007). As suggested by \nShleifer and Vishny (1997) this might happen because specialized arbitrageurs (like large \ninvestment banks and hedge funds) avoid extremely volatile markets when they are risk averse \nand prefer large bond and foreign exchange markets where arbitrage opportunities are better \nexploited. Nevertheless, actions have to be taken in order to attract more investors that can act \nas arbitragers since as shown by Basak and Croitoru (2006) this can improve the risk sharing \namong investors and it can enhance the liquidity of the market.      \n \n \n 4\n2. Market Structure and Frictions for ADEX and ASE \nThe FTSE\/ASE-20 index futures contract (namely FTASE) was first launched in late 1999. Its \nunderlying asset comprises twenty blue chip stocks that are traded on the Athens Stock \nExchange (ASE); these stocks account for more than 50% of the total market capitalization. A \nsecond stock index futures contract was introduced in early 2000 (namely FT40M). The \nunderlying asset is the medium capitalization FTSE\/ASE Mid-40 index and it comprises about \n15% of the total market capitalization. At any time, there are six futures contracts listed for \ntrading: their maturities correspond to the three nearest consecutive months and to the three \nnearest months from the March, June, September and December quarterly cycle. The futures \ncontracts expire on the third Friday of the expiration month and all positions are cash settled. \nFor the period under investigation, trading hours for the ADEX are between 10:45 \u2013 16:15 and \nfor the ASE between 11:00 \u2013 16:00 (so closing data is non-synchronous). The futures are quoted \nin index points and the multiplier is 5 Euros. For further details about the ADEX and ASE \nplease refer to Kavussanos and Visvikis (2007) and also to the ADEX website: \nwww.adex.ase.gr.    \nMarket participants can be classified in three categories: non-exchange\/individual \nmembers, large institutional investors and market makers. Market makers are close related with \nlarge banks or brokerage houses and are obliged to adhere to many trading rules. Their prime \nresponsibility is to enhance market liquidity by providing continuous bid and offer quotes for \nthe two closest to maturity contracts. ADEX officers allow them to trade at significantly low \ntransaction cost levels. Large institutional investors such as insurance companies and mutual \nfunds, can also trade at favourable transaction costs because of their financial status and their \nclose collaboration with an exchange member-agent. On the other hand, individuals trade at \nsignificantly higher costs than large institutional investors.  \nBoth contracts under investigation bear similar transaction cost for taking a long or \nshort position in the futures contract: 15 Euros for individuals, 5 Euros for large institutional \ntraders and 0.22 Euros for market makers5. The transaction cost for taking a long (short) \nposition in a comparable stock portfolio that replicates the FTSE\/ASE-20 index is assumed to \n 5\nbe 0.06% (0.36%) of the index level for market makers, 0.36% (0.66%) of the index level for \ninstitutional traders, and 0.66% (0.96%) of the index level for individuals6. As shown in Table \n1, for the FTSE\/ASE Mid-40 we assume smaller transaction costs because its level is much \nhigher7 than the one of FTSE\/ASE-20. For long (short) positions in the futures contracts the \ninitial margin requirement is set to 12% (14%) of the value of the contract8. In addition profits \nrealized by derivatives are tax free. \n [Table 1, here] \nAfter June 2001, ADEX introduced stock repos (stock lending contracts) and stock \nreverse repos (stocks borrowing contracts) in an attempt to make short selling available to all \ninvestors. The contract size is fixed at 100 shares, the time period of the stock loan is limited to \nsix months and any position in stock reverse repos bears a small non-fixed interest rate. Short \nsale proceeds from the stock reverse repos plus 50% of this amount is needed as an insurance \ndeposit.  \nFor the needs for our analysis we assume that all market participants can benefit from \nquasi-arbitrage trading (Gay and Jung, 1999, Fung and Draper, 1999), so we assume that the \nrate of availability of short sales proceeds equals unity. For the first part of our analysis we \nassume zero tracking error for taking a position in a comparable stock portfolio that replicates \nthe index and we also ignore the cost of borrowing stocks. We examine the alternative \nassumption at a later stage by extending the Gay and Jung (1999) model.  \n \n3. Theoretical Model Prices and Bounds for the Futures Contracts  \nThe cost-of-carry (CoC) model used to find the theoretical value of a futures contact, Ft, at time \nt is defined as (Cornell and French, 1983):  \n \ntTt\u03b4tr\ntt eSF\n)( \u2212= ,  (1) \n \n 6\nwhere  is the current stock index level,  is the time to maturity of the contract, and  and \n represent the annual risk-free rate and dividend yield over the period . Gay and Jung \n(1999) have shown that in the presence of transaction costs and short sales restrictions, the no \narbitrage price must lie within the following lower ( ) and upper (F )  bounds: \ntS tT tr\nt\u03b4 tT\nL\ntF t\nU\n \nS\ntTtr\nFL\ntTtr\ntrcFSSLbrSS\ntTtr\ntL\nt q1eke1\nT\u03b4kkkk1m1kmeSF\n}{\n)()}))((()({\n\u2212++\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212= ,  (2.a) \nand, \nL\ntTtr\nFS\ntTtr\ntrcFLSSSL\ntTtr\ntU\nt q1eke1\nT\u03b4kkkk1eSF\n}(\n)()}()({\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212++++= ,  (2.b) \n \nGay and Jung (1999) derived the above model without taking into consideration: i) the cost of \nborrowing stocks ( ) when taking short positions in the comparable stock portfolio using the \nstocks borrowing mechanism (stock reverse repos), and ii) other market impact costs that can \nresult to tracking error ( ). Following their rationale, Eqs (2.a) and (2.b) present the \nextended model that accounts for these market frictions.  These new market frictions \n(parameters) mostly affect the lower bound that is related to futures underpricing. The other \nparameters of the pricing model are:  ( ) is the percentage transaction cost of a long \n(short) position in the futures contract;  ( ) is the percentage transaction cost of a long \n(short) position in a comparable stock portfolio that replicates the index\nbrk\ntrck\nFLk\nSLk\nFSk\nSSk\n9; m  is the rate of \navailability of short sales proceeds (it lies in [0,1]);   ( ) is the futures margin rate for a \nlong (short) index position; and finally,  represents the future value of dividends until the \nfutures expiration date.  \nLq Sq\n)(T\u03b4\n \n4. Data Description and Analysis of the Mispricing Rates \nWe use intraday data to reduce any non-synchronous issues10 for the period January 2002 to \nDecember 2004. For the FTASE (FT40M) contract we examine 721 (670) trading days \n 7\ncorresponding to 37 expiration dates. We examine the futures mispricing rates by using three \ndifferent datasets. First, we use futures transaction prices that are as close as possible to 15:30, \ni.e. 30 minutes before the close of the underlying market. Second, we use futures observations \nthat are closest to 15:59. For both previous cases the futures data are matched with the \nunderlying index within 30 seconds of the futures transaction. The basic dataset is the one that \nuses intraday data closest to 15:30 and any reference takes this dataset into consideration unless \nstated otherwise. Third, we use index closing prices with futures closing prices that are non-\nsynchronous. It is of interest to see whether the same results can be obtained with or without \nsynchronous data and if mispricings persist within the same day. Future prices are always those \nof the nearest and the second nearest expiration months (volume and open interest details are \navailable from the authors upon request). Other months are excluded to eliminate any potential \nbias arising from thin trading. An appropriate dividend yield is computed from the sum of \ndividends paid out by stocks divided by the per year average market capitalization. We assign a \nconstant dividend yield only during the period that dividends were paid out by companies (from \nApril to August); this is a practice that is actually adopted by ADEX practitioners. Finally, the \none and two month to expiration EURIBOR Euro rates collected from DATASTREAM\u00ae are \nused as an approximation of the risk free rate associated with the nearest and the upcoming \nfutures contracts11.        \nAs a starting point, mispricing rates are evaluated under four different scenarios. In the \nfirst scenario the simple CoC as exhibited in Eq. (1) is used12. In the other three scenarios the \nupper and lower bounds are calculated according to Eqs. (2.a) and (2.b) using the transaction \ncosts of individuals (Ind), large institutional investors (Ins) and market makers (MM). At this \nstage of the analysis we ignore the cost of borrowing stocks and tracking error. \nTable 2 tabulates the futures mispricing results from the three different datasets for the \nFTASE contract. The overall mispricing results are in agreement with international evidence \nfrom other markets (Bailey, 1989, Figlewski, 1984, Modest and Sundaresan, 1983, Brailsford \nand Cusack, 1997, Gay and Jung, 1999). One (the nearest) and two (the upcoming) months to \nexpiration contracts exhibit a tendency of underpricing relative to the theoretical CoC price. \n 8\nUnderpricing is observed in about 58% (69%) of the days for the nearest (upcoming) contract \nwhereas overpricing is observed in only 35% (26%) of the days examined (significant \nunderpricing is also reported by B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995, for the DAX futures market). Under \nmarket frictions, the maximum percentage of fairly priced contracts is observed for non-\nexchange members and the minimum percentage for market makers. For every dataset \nconsidered, the mispricing levels are bigger for the longer maturity contracts. In percentage \nterms the average underpricing of the nearest (upcoming) futures contract is between 0.78%-\n0.97% (1.35%-1.38%) of the index level. The mispricing rates for the FT40M contract \n(available upon request), in general coincide with those of the FTASE. From unreported per \nmaturity mispricing statistics concerning the FTASE contract (available upon request) we \nobserve significant underpricing during October 2002 to August 2003 and April 2004 to June \n2004. Overpricing clustering is more prominent during the last months of 2004. This evidence \nis in contrast to European and other international evidence that report that index futures markets \nbecome more mature and mispricing rates diminish over time (see B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995, \nDwyer et al., 1996, and Brailsfort and Cusack, 1997). Finally, from Table 2 is obvious that \nsimilar mispricing results are obtained regardless of the dataset considered. Arbitrage \nopportunities observed with the 15:30-dataset also persist with the closing prices dataset (see \nEvnine and Rudd, 1985, who document similar patterns for put-call parity violations).  \n[Table 2, here] \n We continue to check the economic significance of the arbitrage violations for low cost \ntraders (market makers and large institutional investors) with ex-ante tests. In accordance to \nprevious studies (B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995, Neal, 1996, Fung and Draper, 1999, Tse, 2001), we \nassume that upon the identification of a significant mispricing, low cost traders can immediately \ntrade the futures contract and take a position in the spot market with a time delay. Using \nevidence from previous studies (i.e. B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995, and Dwyer, et al., 1996), two \ndifferent time delay assumptions are made: i) one (1m) to five (5m) minutes after taking the \nfutures transaction, and ii) use of same day\u2019s index closing prices (C).  \n[Table 3, here] \n 9\n As shown in the Table 3, profitable futures arbitrage opportunities persist in both \nfrequency and level for the one (1m) to five (5m) minute cases. In the case of the nearest \nFTASE contract, when index trade execution is done with the closing price (C), there is a minor \ndecrease in the number of futures overpricing and (especially) underpricing cases for both \ncategory of traders. This is in contrast to B\u00fchler and Kempf (1995) who observe a large number \nof economically significant mispricings that disappear quickly because of arbitrage trading (see \nalso Fung and Draper, 1999, and Tse, 2001). In addition, Dwyer et al. (1996) report for the S&P \n500 futures that as the market becomes more mature (exchange trading history becomes larger) \nmispricing rates are exploited in a shorter amount of time. From unreported statistics we do not \nobserve something similar in our case. This evidence is not necessarily striking but it can reveal \na market that reacts slowly to profitable arbitrage signals.    \nTo make the analysis more realistic we use the extended version of Gay and Jung \n(1999) model.  First, and only for the market makers, we introduce the cost of borrowing stocks \n( ). When market makers sell short stocks that were borrowed, 150% of the proceeds should \nbe deposited in a margin account and as a result the short sales proceeds parameter is always \nzero (\nbrk\nm = 0). The cost of borrowing stocks is set equal to  of the index value in \norder to reflect the opportunity cost of having 150% of the proceeds in a margin account earning \nno interest (see Ackert and Tian, 2001, for a similar approach). For large institutional traders we \nuse  since they can always engage into (quasi) arbitrage trading with stocks that they \nalready hold (a similar assumption is used by B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995).  \n)(. 1e51 tTtr \u2212\n0=brk\n Second, for market makers and large institutional traders, we introduce  with values \nbetween 0 and 1% of the index level in order to approximate for other market impact costs that \ncan result to tracking error. As suggested by Evnine and Rudd (1985) tracking error can exist \neven when index replication is performed with all stocks comprising the index (see also B\u00fchler \nand Kempf, 1995, and Gay and Jung, 1999).  \ntrck\n Table 4 presents the results under the additional market frictions. The first column of \nfigures (when =0) refers to the case where there is no tracking error but stock borrowing is trck\n 10 \ncostly (applies only for market makers); as a result, overpricing frequency and magnitude is as \nbefore. It can be seen that  is significant for market makers because there is an obvious \ndecrease in the futures underpricing cases. This evidence coincides with the assessment of \nModest and Sundaresan (1983) that futures underpricing can be also related to the loss of full \nuse of short sales proceeds.  \nbrk\n+ 2a\n[Table 4, here] \nWhen tracking error is introduced, there is an additional decline in the number of \nfutures mispricing cases for both categories of traders. For 1% tracking error, all overpricing \nopportunities disappear and there is a significant reduction in the underpriced cases. \nNevertheless, for relatively reasonable levels of market impact cost of around 0.4%13, futures \nunderpricing cases are large in number and still economically significant.  \n \n5. Other Factors that Affect the Pricing of the FTASE Contracts \nIn this section regression analysis is employed to identify other factors related with the \nmispricing rates. As in Gay and Jung (1999), (see also Brailsford and Cusack, 1997, Fung and \nDraper, 1999) the linear regression models include variables that are related with the futures \ntime to maturity, market trend, and volatility. The analysis is done on a daily basis with the \n15:30-data based on the CoC model using the regression model given below: \n \n\u2211\u2211\n=\n+\u2212\u2212\n=\n+++++=\n\u03bb \u03c3\u03c3\n1\n5143\n*\n1\n10\nj\nt\nu\nt\na\njtjttjt\nv\nj\njt uaaMACDaTPaaP  (3) \n \nIn the above,  is the mispricing rate for day t and   is set equal to 0 if the time to maturity \nof the nearest (upcoming) futures contract is less than 14 (44) calendar days and to 1 otherwise \n(these values correspond to the average maturity of each contract class).  is the Moving \nAverage Convergence Divergence technical indicator and it is defined as the difference between \na 26-day and a 12-day exponential moving average indicator. Moreover,  ( ) is the \ntP\n*\ntT\ntMACD\na\nt\u03c3\nu\nt\u03c3\n 11 \nmaturity adjusted ARMA(2,1)-GARCH(1,1) anticipated (unanticipated) volatility of the \nFTSE\/ASE-20 index. Regression results for the nearest and upcoming FTASE contract are \npresented in Table 5. All regression models are checked for serial correlation14 up to the fifth \nresidual lag based on the Breusch-Godfrey LM statistic (Godfrey, 1988). The coefficient \nstandard errors are estimated with White\u2019s (1980) heteroskedasticity consistent covariance \nmatrix. \nDaily market volatility is decomposed into anticipated and unanticipated using a two-\nstep approach (see Zhang et al., 2005). In the first step, an ARMA(2,1)-GARCH(1,1) \nspecification (results are available upon request) is estimated using the FTASE\/ASE-20 returns \nfor the period 23\/9\/1997 to 31\/12\/2004 (call this Spec. #1). This is used to compute the daily \nmarket volatility via the fitted conditional standard deviation values of the model. In the second \nstep, a volatility value is re-estimated daily using the above model specification based on prices \nbeginning on 29\/9\/1997 and ending on the day prior to the day of each mispricing observation \n(call this Spec. #2). Using Spec. #2 we compute daily standard deviation return forecasts to \nestimate next day\u2019s anticipated market volatility ( ). In addition the difference between Spec. \n#1 and Spec. #2 is used to estimate next day\u2019s unanticipated market volatility (\u03c3 ). \na\nt\u03c3\nu\nt\n[Tables 5, here] \nFrom the results of Table 5, the coefficients on the lagged mispricing rates are positive \nand significant. This indicates persistence of the mispricing and complies with evidence by \nMacKinlay and Ramaswamy (1988). For the nearest and upcoming contracts the time to \nmaturity coefficient is positive15 most probably because the time to maturity effect is captured \nby the maturity adjusted volatility variables. Regarding the market trend variable, , it is \nmarginally significant at 10% only for the nearest contract. This possibly indicates that futures \nmispricings are not affected by speculative trading that is related with the direction of the spot \nmarket. The anticipated volatility estimates are negative and statistically significant at 1% in \nboth maturity contracts. In addition, the coefficient of the unanticipated volatility is negative \nand significant at 5% for the nearest to maturity contract and marginally insignificant at 10% for \ntMACD\n 12 \nthe upcoming contract. The latter evidence is probably induced by the emerging characteristics \nof the underlying market that may not at all time reacting rationally and thus reflecting all \navailable information. \n  \n10. Conclusions \nThe results allow us to study the efficiency evolution of this new market. If we accept that the \ncost-of-carry model is a true approximation of the correct futures price, then we must consider \nthe Athens Derivatives Exchange to be inefficient, at least during its early trading history. Even \nunder more general assumptions about the prevailing market frictions, one can still observe \neconomically significant mispricing cases.  \nThe above analysis has different implications. First and most importantly, a significant \ndependence of the futures mispricings with volatility related variables has been identified by the \nregression analysis. This might imply that the futures market is dominated by the activities of \nhedgers (a similar conclusion is also reached by Kavussanos and Visvikis, 2007) who mainly \nwish to sell futures contracts in order to hedge their stock portfolio positions against volatility \nchanges. Low cost traders like market makers and large institutional investors do not seem to \nactively engage in arbitrage trading in order to bring prices back to fundamental values. This \nmight happen for various reasons like for example because of capital constrains (Tse, 2001, \nBasak and Croitoru, 2006), because specialized performance based arbitrage is ineffective in the \npresence of different agency relationships between arbitrageurs and investors (Shleifer and \nVishny, 1997), or because low cost traders in ADEX require extremely high risk premia in order \nto exploit the arbitrage opportunities (B\u00fchler and Kempf, 1995). Moreover other market \nconditions that might have prevailed during this period \u2212 like the maturity, the size of the \nderivatives market and the limited number of derivatives products \u2212 did not help in attracting \nthe attention of large (and foreign) arbitrage specialist.  \nSecond, our results complement and support other empirical evidence documented for \nthe Athens Derivatives Exchange. For example, Alexakis et al. (2007) find that informed \n 13 \ninvestors are not indifferent between trading in the futures and the cash market since only \ninformation that is released by the cash market has as an effect on the futures behavior (the \nreverse does not hold); thus giving birth to exploitable arbitrage and hedging opportunities (see \nalso Kenourgios,  2005). Moreover, Lafuente and Novales (2003) show that when there is a \nsystematic mispricing between the futures and the spot market the hedging effectiveness is \noptimized when using a lower number of futures contracts compared to the position taken to the \nstock index portfolio. Then our findings can offer an additional explanation why in the study of \nKavussanos and Visvikis (2007) the minimum variance hedge ratio is significantly below unity.    \n The results indicate that actions should be taken that will eventually help increase the \nfutures market efficiency by allowing additional investors (local and foreign) to participate in \nthe market. In addition, the Athens Stock Exchange sometimes behaves as an emerging market \nwith periods of aggressive rises and falls; so policy makers should find ways to further enhance \nliquidity and stabilize the spot market. Finally, the stocks borrowing mechanism seems to be \nunder used by market participants; for the period we consider, the number of contracts that \ninvestors could trade was small and the number of stocks available for index short selling was \nlimited. Therefore, any arbitrage trade could have been done only with a small number of \ncontracts resulting to limited profits.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Andreas Papanayotopoulos for all his helpful comments and useful \ninsights related to the Athens Derivatives Exchange trading mechanisms.

The upper part \nof each panel presents the frequency of mispricing rates and the lower tabulates the mean values of the mispricing \nrates.         \nbrk trck trck\n \n \n 20 \n \nTable 5: Regression analysis for the FTASE mispricing rates  \n            \n 0\u03b1 * 11\u03b1  12\u03b1  13\u03b1  2\u03b1 * 3\u03b1 * 41\u03b1  42\u03b1  5\u03b1  \n2\nadjR  )(5x 2  \n            \n 0.18 0.80 --- --- 0.84 0.01 -2.47 1.75 -2.08 0.697 6.857 1M [0.65] [0.00] [0.09] [0.10] [0.00] [0.00] [0.03]   \n            \n2M 0.43 0.79 0.06 0.10 0.27 0.01 -1.54 1.23 -0.83 0.877 5.52 [0.65] [0.00] [0.36] [0.05] [0.50] [0.35] [0.00] [0.02] [0.12]   \n \n \nRegression results for the near (1M) and upcoming (2M) maturity futures contracts. Mispricing rates are \nbased on the cost of carry model for the period 2002-2004 for 721 observations. The regression model is \nbased on the following definition:  \n\u2211\u2211\n=\n+\u2212\u2212\n=\n++++++=\n\u03bb \u03c3\u03c3\n1\n5143\n*\n2\n1\n10\nj\nt\nu\nt\na\njtjttjt\nv\nj\njt uaaMACDaTaPaaP  \nwhere  is the futures mispricing rate, is a dummy variable related with the futures time to maturity, \n is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence technical indicator and  ( ) is the maturity \nadjusted ARMA(2,1)-GARCH(1,1) anticipated (unanticipated) volatility of the FTSE\/ASE-20 index. All \nregression results are based on the White (1980) heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors and covariance \nmatrix. The Chi-Square test refers to the Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation LM statistic for serial correlation \nup to the fifth lag (the critical value at 5% significance level for five lags is 11.10). To avoid autocorrelation \nin the residuals, one (three) lagged values of the futures mispricing rates is (are) included for the nearest \n(upcoming) futures contracts. For the same reason we include one lag value of the anticipated volatility. \nFigures with (*) are multiplied by 1,000. \ntP\nt\n*\ntT\nMACD at\u03c3\nu\nt\u03c3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 21 \n 22 \nEndnotes  \n                                          \n1 To our knowledge, Kenourgios (2005) uses minute-by-minute prices to examine the joint hypothesis of \nmarket efficiency and unbiasedness (only) for the FTSE\/ASE-20 index futures contracts using \ncointegration analysis for the period March 2000 to March 2002. \n2 We examined the existence of cycles with a regression analysis in which we have used three yearly \ndummies to represent the trading years under investigation and we observed a clear U shape in the \nestimated dummy coefficients and their corresponding p-values (results not reported for brevity). \n3 Shleifer and Vishny (1997) and Basak and Croitoru (2006) show that under capital constrains \narbitrageurs (e.g. low cost traders) limit the size of their trades and never fully \u201carbitrage away\u201d the \nmispricing rates.  \n4 Basak and Croitoru (2006) develop a model where arbitrage opportunities arise endogenously in \nequilibrium in the presence heterogeneous rational investors that are subject to investment restrictions.  \n5 These Euro values are transformed to represent percentage values of the index level by dividing them \nwith the level of the index times the index multiplier.   \n6 The transaction costs used here seem on average to be higher compared to the ones used as benchmark \nin Dwyer et al. (1996) which is 0.25% of the index value for exchange members and 0.38% for \ninstitutional investors. Also in B\u00fchler and Kempf (1995) for low cost traders the total transaction cost of a \nlong arbitrage position is about 0.125% of the value of the stock portfolio and on average around 0.50% \nfor a short arbitrage (including the cost of borrowing the stocks).     \n7 For the period 2002-2004, the average index value for FTSE\/ASE-20 is about 1,128 whereas for \nFTSE\/ASE Mid-40 is about 2,201. \n8 The differential margin for the short and long futures positions is not significant and does not change \nour results. \n9 kSL and kSS refer to transaction costs paid under the assumption that tracking error does not exist when \ntaking a long (short) position to a comparable stock portfolio that replicates the underlying index. We \nhave introduced ktrc as an additional transaction cost proportional to the index level to mitigate this market \nfriction.    \n10 Tick futures and index transactions data were obtained from the AGFN database (ADEX official data \nvendor). Closing prices, volumes and open interest for the FTASE futures contract were obtained from \nthe ADEX research department and closing index prices from the ASE research department. \n11 Our results are robust to the levels of dividend yields and risk-free rates used. \n12 It is rare for the market value of the futures to be exactly the same with the CoC estimate. A transaction \nis considered to be mispriced if it deviates by more than -\/+0.05% for intraday data or by more than 0.1% \nfor closing data.  \n13 This value is even higher compared to the levels of other studies. Gay and Jung (1999) assume that the \nmarket impact cost from trading a 50-stock portfolio that replicates an index comprised by 200 stocks is \nabout 0.4% of the index value. B\u00fchler and Kempf (1994) document that DAX futures index arbitrager are \nwilling to trade only if, in addition to transaction costs, a required risk premium equal to 4 index points is \ncovered by the mispricing.  \n14 To avoid autocorrelation in the residuals, lagged values of the futures mispricing rates and of the \nanticipated volatility are included. \n15 Using a regression model where volatility related variables are excluded we find that the coefficient of \ntime to maturity is negative for both maturities and statistically significant for the nearest contract. This \nevidence complies with previous research (i.e. MacKinlay and Ramaswamy, 1988 and B\u00fchler and Kempf, \n1995). \n"}
