INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, the improved characteristics of thick film\ntechnology make it highly applicable to modem commercial,\nindustrial, and military applications. The advances in thick film\ntechnology, notably in terms of lower material losses and finer\nline definitions, have been enabled this relatively low-cost\nprocess to become a viable option for the development of\nmicrowave passive components. The factors of size reduction,\nlow loss, mass production, and cost effectiveness are essential\nissues that need to be considered when seeking to achieve\noptimum component design. This paper addresses some of the\nkey issues of performance and repeatability through\ninvestigations on a practical X-band thick-film filter.\nFilters play an important role in modem wireless\ncommunication systems for out-of-band rejection to prevent\ninter-channel interference (ICI) and wide bandwidth\nrequirements for system operation. In this work a 9.5GHz edge\ncoupled bandpass filter in single layer configuration is\nfabricated on typical alumina substrate with a thickness of\n635ptm and relative permittivity (er) of about 9.8, thus leads to\nreduction in component size. Care should be taken for\nmicrostrip line structure using screen printing process such that\nthe characteristics of design are dominated by the dimensions\nand definitions of lines.\nOwing to many uncertain factors during characterization\nprocess such as structural shrinkage after firing, error\nallowance of substrate production, and imperfect mesh screen\nprinting, some analysis on the sources of error of physical\ndimensions are performed to have not only a prediction of\ncircuit performance but also a reference for future design\nconsiderations. The RF performance is tested by measurements\nusing a vector network analyzer and the measured results are\ncompared with simulation.\nII. THICK FILM TECHNOLOGY\nThick film technology is a highly flexible and low-cost\nfabrication process for many applications such as digital\nintegrated circuits, high-power and high-voltage circuits, and\nalso high frequency microwave circuits. The thick films are\nproduced by screen printing of conducting and insulating\nmaterials on ceramic substrates [1].\nFigure 1. Thick Film Process\nFig. 1 shows the thick film process that was used to\nfabricate the bandpass filter in this study. The standard screen-\nprinting process includes the three conventional steps of pattern\nprinting, drying, and firing. Printed-line definition is dominated\nby the mesh density which includes the diameter of mesh wire\nfor the shapes of lines. The paste viscosity is influenced by\nroom temperature, the pressure, angular position and hardness\nof squeegee are all significant factors in establishing the\nthickness of the print. The thick film paste is applied as a\npattern by screen printing over the total area of the insulating\nsubstrate. Drying process is applied on the printed thick film\nlayer to remove volatile solvent. And it is performed in a\nnatural-drying oven with an optimized temperature of 80\u00b0C for\n20 minutes. The firing is performed in programmable chamber\nfurnace to provide the high density thick film structure. The\nfiring is made at temperature around 850\u00b0C for 6 to 8 hours to\ncomplete the entire firing process. The firing process not only\nremoves the remaining organic binders but also develops the\nelectrical properties [2]. When the operating frequency of\ndesign is higher, higher modes become excited. Therefore,\nthinner substrates are required to avoid the higher order modes\ninfluencing the performance of the circuits. The surface\nroughness of the substrate is important because it will affect the\nsurface roughness on the bottom of the printed conductor layer.\nSurface smoothness of the printed layer relies on the stroke\n1-4244-0749-4\/07\/$20.00 w2007 IEEE.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 5, 2010 at 04:32 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nstability of the squeegee and the fluidity of the blade.\nTherefore, optimized settings of the printing machine including\ndown-force pressure, and speed of stroke movement, are\nrequired. The screen is composed of an emulsion layer and\nstainless steel mesh with an assembling frame for robustness\nand stability during the printing action. The recommended\nemulsion thickness of their corresponding mesh counts for\nconductor paste printing is 18um (325 Mesh). These settings\nproduce the fired thickness of conductor to be about 10-12um\nper layer [3].\nIII. FILTER DESIGN\nIn general, the edge coupled microstrip bandpass filters,\nwith bandwidths less than about 20% can be easily fabricated.\nBut, very tightly coupled lines are needed if wider bandwidth\nfilters are required. By reducing the substrate thickness, the\ntrack separation becomes smaller. However, this small track\nseparation can be a problem during the circuit fabrication [4].\nThe trade-off between substrate thickness, minimum coupling\ngap, characteristics impedance and overall loss is a very\nimportant issue that needs to be considered to achieve the\nrequired filter performance.\nIn this study, several samples of 7-section bandpass filter\nhave been designed with a center frequency of 9.5 GHz with\nrequired fractional bandwidth of 10%, and a roll-off specified\nby IS211<-3OdB at 8GHz and 10GHz. The filters were\nfabricated on Alumina substrate (e- =9.8) with a thickness of\n635ptm. And the physical dimensions of each coupled section\nare shown in Table I.\nTABLE I\nTHE SIMULATED DIMENSIONS OF THE BANDPASS FILTER AT\n9.423GHz\nSection\nWidth (fW)\nSpace (S)\nLength (L)\n1\n0.413\n0.175\n3.053\n2\n0.635\n0.568\n2.945\n3\n0.635\n0.873\n2.929\n4\n0.635\n0.873\n2.929\n5\n0.635\n0.873\n2.929\n6\n0.635\n0.568\n2.945\nThe physical dimensions were inserted into a full-wave\nsimulator for verification of the circuit performance. Fig.2 and\nFig.3 show the simulated and measured responses of the\ndesign. The filter design has a center frequency of 9.423GHz\nwith 3dB bandwidth which was about 1.06GHz (11.3%) and\nroll-off of IS211<-30dB at 8GHz and 10.4GHz. The measured\ncircuit has a center frequency of 9.527GHz with 3dB\nbandwidth which about 1GHz (10.5%) and roll-off of IS211<-\n30dB at 8.62GHz and 10.39GHz with insertion loss of 1.84dB.\nIt is seen from the results that the bandwidth slightly shrinks.\nThe reason was mainly due to the shrinkages of the conductor\nlayer, resulting in the increase of spacing of each filter section.\nAnd this may be also the reason for the shift of design's centre\nfrequency in comparison with the specifications. Although the\nlosses due to the dielectric material and bulk conductors had\nbeen included in the simulation, the additional insertion loss\nmay be due to the surface roughness of the fired circuits. This\neffect becomes announced in mm-wave frequencies, and\nshould be included in the design.\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50 -e- ~~~Sim. S21-50 Mea.

Changes of dimensions will alter\ntheir characteristics and have influence on component design of\nsuch structure. Since thick-film fabrication technology is being\nused there will be some shrinkage when the printed conductors\nare fired. Shrinkage of final fired circuits results in the changes\nof dimensions and performance. Analysis on the dimensions\ntolerance is performed to check any influences occurred after\nthe firing process.\nIV. FABRICATION ERROR ANALYSIS\nDue to the variation in circuit geometries that can occur\nduring a thick-film processing cycle, some analysis of the\neffects of these errors is essential. A number circuit samples\nwere fabricated by completing the same stages of the\nfabrication process under identical conditions using a semi-\nautomatic screen printer.\nFig. 4 shows the comparison of the insertion loss with\ndifferent changes of physical dimensions, whilst Fig. 5 is the\nvariation of the impedance matching within pass band for the\ndifferent cases. A five percent decrease of the filter's lengths\nand widths results in a narrower bandwidth of about 10.57%\nF I_\n-II .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

A five percent of increase of\ndimensions results in a wider bandwidth of about 12.2% with\nbetter roll-off, and slightly upward shift of the center frequency\nof around 2.46%. It is reasonable since decrease of line width\nresults in larger spacing of each filter section and therefore\nnarrower bandwidth. This analysis gives a useful insight into\nthe effect on the filter's electrical performance, due to\nshrinkage occurring during the firing process.\n1.66dB in average. The average center frequency (fo) of these\nsamples was measured to be about 9.53GHz with 3dB\nbandwidth (BW) of 1GHz (10.59%). The slight decrease of\nbandwidth may be due to the shrinkage of the conductor which\nwas found to be about 1%, and is acceptably small. Sample #3\ncan be regarded as the best one with the minimal insertion loss,\nwidest bandwidth, and moderate shrinkage compared with the\nsimulation results.\n2\n0\n-20\ni -30\n8 8.5 9 9.5 10 10.5 11\nFrequency, GHz\nFigure 4.

Restrictions apply. \nThe variations of the dimensions of the filter elements are\ncrucial to the performance of the component. In order to\nunderstand the effect of the fabrication process, it is essential\nto obtain accurate information about the variations in the\nwidths and spacings of the conductors. These aspects will\nassume greater importance as the frequency of the design is\nextended into the millimetre-wave region. In the present study,\nmicroscopic examination of the fabricated circuits was used to\nobtain accurate dimensional data after firing.\nThe variations between the measured and designed\ndimensions namely, Werr, Serr and Lerr, were defined and\nmeasured relatively to the guide wavelength at the design's\ncenter frequency. It was found from Fig. 6 that the variations of\nwidths are relatively small compared with the dispersive\nproperties of the microstrip line structures. This is also evident\nfrom the measured passband return loss shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 7\nshows the measured spacing error of each filter section versus\nsection number, for the four samples. It is seen that the sample\n#3 has the minimum Ser, at the first section, which dominates\nthe design's operating bandwidth. Fig. 8 shows the measured\nlengths error ratio versus section number of the samples. It is\nfound that sample #4 has the smallest length error while sample\n#2 has the biggest length error. These results matched with the\nresults which were found from Table II such that the sample #3\nhas the minimal Serr and a measured bandwidth that is closest\nto the desired value. This is reasonable since the decrease in the\nspacing of each section results in an increase in bandwidth. In\nsummary, from the measured results, the width error has\ninfluence on the impedance matching while any spacing error\nresults in the variations of the design's operating bandwidth.\nThe slight shift in the centre frequency may have been due to\nshrinkage effects, but more likely to incorrect compensation for\nelectromagnetic fringing at the end of each section. Although\nthe losses due to the dielectric material and bulk conductors\nhad been included in the simulation, the additional insertion\nloss may be due to the surface roughness of the fired circuits.\nThis measurement-based analysis forms not only predictable\ndata but also applicable information for circuit designers,\nwhere the compensation of dimensions to account for\nfabrication errors are required at the design stage.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe work has shown that shrinkage effects during the\nfabrication of thick-film planar circuits can have a significant\neffect on the electrical performance. However, data for a series\nof components fabricated under near-identical processing\nconditions has shown the shrinkage effects are relatively\npredictable, and can be taken account of in the initial circuit\ndesign. Thus the results demonstrate the shrinkage that occurs\nin the processing of thick-film components does not detract\nfrom the low-cost, high-volume production advantages offered\nby thick-film technology.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. M.
