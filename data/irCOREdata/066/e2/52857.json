Mining and smelting \nactivities have left a legacy of contaminated land, with As- and Cu-rich mine tailings \nand other wastes abundant. Today, many of the old mining and smelting sites are \nderelict contaminated land, with extensive areas of mine spoil and ruins of stacks and \narsenic calciners. \n \nA soil geochemical survey of the 920 km2 Tamar catchment in SW England (Fig. 1) \nundertaken by the British Geological Survey [1] demonstrated that approximately 60% \nof the sites throughout the catchment had total soil As values above the Soil Guideline \nValue (SGV) of 20 mg kg-1  for residential land use. [2] The most contaminated land \nwas in the south of the catchment, in the Kit Hill\/Gunnislake and Tamar Valley areas, \nin areas of intense former mining activity. The tiered risk-based approach advocated \nin UK guidance for the assessment of contaminated land suggests that further site-\n 3 \nspecific studies should be undertaken for these soils. However, the assumption for the \ndevelopment of generic guideline values for contaminants in soils [2] is that the total \nAs concentration ingested from soils is taken up into the body via the gastro-intestinal \ntract. As a result of using the total element concentration to asses the human risk and \nderive the SGVs, if As in soils is not 100% bioaccessible and less available than the \nmore soluble forms of As dissolved in water, an overestimation of the associated \nhealth risk is likely and contaminated sites may be designated unsuitable for their \npresent or intended use. \n \nTo assess the fraction of As in the soil that is likely to be bioaccessible, and hence \nimprove estimates of human health risk, soil extraction tests have been developed that \nmimic the conditions in the human gastrointestinal tract. In this study, a modified \nversion of the physiologically based extraction test (PBET) developed by Ruby et al. \n[3] and described by Cave et al. [4], was carried out to measure the bioaccessibility of \nAs in soils and mine wastes from Devon Great Consols (DGC) Mine on the east bank \nof the River Tamar, SW England. \n  \nThe relationship between As bioaccessibility, As partitioning in the mineral phase and \nsoil properties was investigated. This is important to estimate the medium-long term \nfate of As and its bioaccessibility in the environment. \n \n \nMATERIALS  AND METHODS \n \n \n 4 \nStudy Area and Sample Collection \n \n \nThe Devon Great Consols Mine on the east bank of the River Tamar in the Tavistock \ndistrict was one of the most successful Cu producers during SW England\u2019s global \ndominance of the Cu mining industry in the 1800s. The mine, which was derived from \nthe consolidation of five adjacent mines, worked on lodes mainly consisting of \nchalcopyrite, pyrite and some arsenopyrite and cassiterite with quartz, fluorspar and \nbrecciated host mudrocks cemented by chlorite or siderite. Later attention turned to \nAs and an output of over 70 000 tons was recorded between 1848 and 1909. [5] In the \n1870s half the world\u2019s As production was estimated to come from half a dozen mines \nin the Callington and Tavistock area, including Devon Great Consols. Mining activity \nat Devon Great Consols ended in 1930. Today the highest concentrations of As, Cu, \nSn and W in the Tamar catchment are found around the Devon Great Consols Mine. \n[1] \n \nOne hundred and nine soils and tailings were sampled at Devon Great Consols Mine \nand in the surroundings of the mine, 87 mine soils and 22 tailings. Further sampling \nincluded 20 soils from a site on agricultural land located at Higher Todsworthy Farm, \nDrakewalls (mineralized soils), containing a mineral lode that has not been worked. \nFive soils around Bere Alston village (background soils, taken outside of the \nmineralised area, approximately 7 km to the south-east of DGC) were also collected. \nAll samples (0\u201315 cm depth) were made up of a composite of material from auger \nflights taken from five holes distributed within an area of approximately one metre \nsquare. \n 5 \n \n \nChemical Analysis \n \n \nAll samples were air-dried and sieved to <250 \u00b5m. The soil pH was measured in \n0.01M CaCl2 solution, liquid to solid ratio of 5 to 2. The organic matter content was \nestimated by measuring the weight loss after heating to a temperature of 450 \u00b0C for a \nminimum of 4 hours, i.e. loss on ignition (LOI). Total element content of the <250 \u00b5m \nfraction was obtained by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-\nAES) after digestion of the samples (0.25 g) with a mixture of concentrated \nhydrofluoric (1mL), perchloric (0.4 mL) and nitric (0.8 mL) acids.  \n \n \nPartitioning by Sequential Extraction \n \n \nChemical sequential extraction was carried out in order to characterise element \nmineral distribution. Two grams of sample were supported on a filtration membrane \nin a centrifuge tube. Extraction was then carried out using first, for steps 1 and 2, \ndeionised water and then separate aliquots of aqua regia of increasing concentration, \nthat were passed through the sample under centrifugal force. Each extraction step was \ncarried out twice (0.01 M (steps 3 and 4), 0.05 M (steps 5 and 6), 0.1 M (steps 7 and \n8), 0.5 M (steps 9 and 10), 1 M (steps 11 and 12), 5 M (steps 13 and 14) aqua regia) \nand 10 mL of leaching solution used. For the 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 M acid extracts, 0.25, \n 6 \n0.50, 0.75 and 1 mL, respectively, of hydrogen peroxide were also added to each \nextractant before making up to 10 mL volume. The solutions obtained were analysed \nfor major and trace elements by ICP-AES. A data-processing algorithm was used to \nidentify the number of physico-chemical components extracted, their composition and \nthe proportion in each extract according to the Chemometric Identification of \nSubstrates and Element Distributions (CISED) method described in Cave et al. [4] The \nchemometric data-processing is based on the assumption that the material is made up \nof a mixture of discrete physico-chemical components characterised by a distinct \nelement composition. Under increasing acid concentration each physico-chemical \ncomponent will dissolve according to its degree and rate of solubility. \n \nThe following outputs from processing the CISED soil extraction data are generated: \na series of profiles or \u2018extractograms\u2019 for each sample extracted (one for each \nidentified component); a table of the elemental compositions of each identified \ncomponent, and information relating to the distribution of the elements determined \nwithin each identified component.  The \u2018extractograms\u2019 show that some physico-\nchemical components present in a soil are extracted at the beginning of the CISED \nextraction procedure, whereas others require higher acid concentrations depending on \ntheir component compositions.  \u2018Extractograms\u2019 are simple plots of the total mass of \nextracted elements against reagent concentration or extraction solution (steps 1-14) \nand provide useful information on the mobility of the potentially harmful elements \nwithin the sample under investigation.  Combination of the \u2018extractogram\u2019 with the \nassociated chemical composition data provides a geochemical fingerprint, which helps \nto identify the source of each component.  \n \n 7 \n \nDetermination of the Amorphous and Crystalline Iron Oxyhydroxides \n \n \nThe amorphous Fe oxyhydroxides were extracted using Tamm\u2019s reagent (0.175 M \nammonium oxalate + 0.100 M oxalic acid in the dark for 4 hours). The dithionite-\ncitrate method of extraction from Merha and Jackson [6] was used to extract \namorphous + crystalline iron oxyhydroxides. \n \n \nDetermination of the Bioaccessible Arsenic \n \n \nThe bioaccessible As content of the soils was determined using a modified version of \nthe Physiologically Based Extraction Test (PBET) first developed by Ruby et al. [3] to \nsimulate the leaching of a solid matrix in the human gastrointestinal tract and has been \nfully described by Cave et al. [7] The PBET method simulates the sequential changes \nin the physico-chemical environment of the gastrointestinal tract, from acidic gastric \nconditions to neutral to slightly alkaline intestinal conditions. The PBET was divided \ninto three stages, defined by three sets of sampling test solution for analysis.  Stage 1 \ncorresponds to the period spent in the stomach environment and stage 2 and 3 those \nspent in the small intestine environment to different times. One gram of each prepared \nsoil sample was accurately weighed into a wide mouthed HDPE bottle. 100 mL of \nsimulated gastric solution (1.25 g pepsin, 0.50 g sodium malate, 0.50 g sodium citrate, \n420 \u00b5L lactic acid and 500 \u00b5L acetic acid made up to 1 L with freshly prepared de-\n 8 \nionised water, adjusted to pH 2.5 with concentrated HCl) was added to each bottle. \nThe extraction bottles were placed in an end over end shaker in a thermostat \ncontrolled water bath set at 37 \u00b0C. After an initial incubation period of one hour at 37 \n\u00b0C, a 5.0 mL aliquot was removed and filtered through a Gelman 0.45 \u00b5L cellulose \nfilter disk for analysis. This extraction sample is known as the stomach phase. 5.0 mL \nof fresh gastric solution was then back-flushed through the used filter into the HDPE \nbottle. The conditions in each vessel were then altered to simulate the environment \nfound in the small intestine, by titration to pH 7.0 with saturated NaHCO3 and the \naddition of 175 mg bile salt and 50 mg pancreatin. After incubation in the water bath \nfor a further 2 hours a sample known as small intestine 1 was removed. After an \nadditional 2 hours the final extract was removed, known as small intestine 2. The \nvalue used for calculating As Bioaccessibility is the highest of the bioaccessibility \nvalues measured for the stomach, intestine 1 and intestine 2 phases, as this will \nprovide the most conservative value for human health risk assessments. \nThe fraction of As bioaccessibility was calculated as follows: \n \n% *100HighestPBETextractedAsTotalAsBf =   \n \nQuality Control\/Quality Assurance \n \nThe quality control (QC) samples were analysed as part of the ICP-AES and TOC \nanalytical runs to check for instrument drift, accuracy and precision. The QC samples \nwere standard BGS QC solutions made up in accordance with the BGS Quality \nAssurance\/UKAS Quality System. In addition to the routine instrumental analysis of \nQC samples, the extraction and digestion methods also involved the extraction and \n 9 \nanalysis of blank samples, reference materials (NIST 2710) and analytical and \nsampling duplicates. The repeatability for the analytical duplicates for the BGS PBET \nmethodology for As was 2-15%. The repeatability for the sampling duplicates was 1-\n29 %.  The uncertainty for total As measurements was 10% for analytical duplicates \nand 6-25 % for the sampling duplicates. \n \n \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n \nTotal Arsenic Concentrations \n \nTable 1 shows soil pH, LOI, total As, total bioaccessible As, percent bioaccessible As \nby soil groups and in the tailings. Arsenic concentrations range from 2150 mg kg-1 \n(median value) in the soils at the mine site to 163 mg kg-1 (median value) in \nagricultural soils over mineralisation not affected by mining activities. Lower As \nconcentrations are found in the soils collected in Bere Alston, which represents a \nbackground area away from mining works (median value of 93 mg kg-1). The tailings \nhave an As median value of 19200 mg kg-1. \n \nFigure 2 shows the spatial distribution of As in soils and tailings throughout the mine \nsite. The highest As soil values (up to 69000 mg kg-1) occur as clusters around the As \nworks, in proximity to the main tailings heaps (south of the As works) and along the \nmineral vein passing to the north-west of the mine. The soil concentrations of As in \n 10 \nthe woodland covering a large part of the mine are lower, ranging between 250 and \n1000 mg kg-1. \n \n \nArsenic Bioaccessibility \n \n \nBioaccessible As shows a median value of 8 mg kg-1 in the background soils of Bere \nAlston and a median value of 14 mg kg-1 in the mineralised soils not disturbed by \nmining activities of Drakewalls (Table 1). The bioaccessible As values for the mine \ntailings and the soils in the mine area and the surroundings are well above any \nthreshold concentrations with median value of 845 mg kg-1 for the tailings and of 351 \nmg kg-1 for the soils (Table 1). \n \nThe trend of dissolution observed in the stomach and intestine phases of the PBET \nextraction for the studied soils is characterised by higher As solubility passing from \nthe stomach phase (pH 2.5) to the intestine phase (pH 7), with the highest PBET-\nextracted As predominantly in the intestine phase of stage 3 (Table 1). The Friedman \nstatistic test (non-parametric two way analysis of variance) was used to establish the \nsignificant difference (at 95% confidence level) across the PBET phases for each soil \ngroup.  \n \nThe percent bioaccessible As (median values) is 15% for the mine soils, 9 % for both \nthe background soils and the \u201cmineralized\u201d soils and 5% for the tailings (Table 1), all \nbased upon the bioaccessibility in the intestine phase stage 3. \n 11 \n \n \nArsenic Partitioning in the Solid Phase \n \n \nSequential extraction data were used to help elucidate the nature of the As hosts in the \ndifferent soil types and to understand which of these is responsible for the mobile \nbioaccessible fraction.  In order to identify the solid phase partitioning of As the data \nwere subjected to the CISED chemometric data-processing procedure. The \nchemometric data-processing methodology is based on the assumption that the \nmaterial is made of a mixture of discrete physico-chemical components characterised \nby distinct element composition. The extractograms in mg kg-1 of each component for \neach extraction stage are reported for two mine soils, DGC 112 and MPS 8, with low \nand high As concentrations, respectively. \n \nFigure 3 shows the 8 components extracted in soil DGC 112 (mine soil), representing \nthe acid soils (pHCaCl2 in the range of 3-4) from the mine site covered by woodland \n(Total As= 566 mg kg-1; bioaccessible As= 92 mg kg-1; percent bioaccessible As= \n16%). Each component was named using a combination of the chemical elements that \ncontribute more than 10 % by weight to the composition of the components. It is \npossible to recognise in the first component extracted at stage 1-2 the composition of \nan acid soil solution rich in S, Al and K, Na and Mn. In order of increasing difficulty \nof extraction two Mn-oxyhydroxide components and a number of Al, Al-Fe and Fe \noxyhydroxide components follow. The majority of the As is associated with Fe \n 12 \noxyhydroxides and Al- Fe oxyhydroxides mainly extracted at steps 9-14 of the \nsequential extraction (Fig. 3 and Fig. 5).  \n \nThe results of the CISED processing of soil MPS 8, a highly contaminated soil (total \nAs= 31000 mg kg-1; bioaccessible As= 1770 mg kg-1; percent bioaccessible As= 5.7 \n%) collected in the proximity of the mine calciner (mine soil), show that As is mainly \nassociated with Fe-dominated components extracted at the last stages of the extraction \n(Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). A subordinate, but significant amount of As is present in a Ca-Fe \ndominated component. The As-Ca-Fe association were also recognized by scanning \nelectron microscope (SEM) observation in the coatings rimming sulphide grains and \nin discrete Ca-As-Fe particles from the mine waste. [8] They undoubtedly formed as a \nresult of ore processing. [9] This Ca-Fe component containing ca 2300 mg kg-1 As \nshows a peak of extraction at an early stage in the leaching, suggesting higher \nsolubility than the Fe dominated components (Fig. 3), and possibly a greater \ncontribution to the As bioaccessible fraction than the Fe oxyhydroxides. \n \n \n \nSpatial Distribution of Bioaccessible Arsenic in the Mine Soils and Relationship \nwith Other Physico-chemical Soil Parameters \n \n \nTotal concentrations of As and the percent bioaccessible fraction show a large spread \nof values in DGC mine soils suggesting that the data are derived from more than one \npopulation of samples. Deposition of stack emissions during smelting of the sulphide \n 13 \nore, wind and water dispersion from tailings heaps, distribution during transport from \nthe shafts and smelters could also have contributed to the As concentrations in the \nstudied mine soils. By using k-means clustering of the soil physico-chemical variables \nthe soils were grouped into 4 clusters, whose spatial distribution throughout the mine \nis shown in Figure 6.  \n \nFigure 7 shows the calculated centroids of each observation cluster. Clusters 1 \nrepresents most of the acid soils in the mine covered by woodland and characterised \nby relatively low As concentrations (total As median value = 1070 mg kg-1) and the \nhighest bioaccessible As fraction (percent As bioaccessibility median value = 22 %). \nCluster 2 groups the soils mainly from the eastern part of the mine along the railway \ntracks used to transport the ore from the shafts, characterised by relatively low As \nconcentrations (total As median value = 843 mg kg-1), similar to cluster 1, but with a \nlower bioaccessible As fraction (percent As bioaccessibility median value = 10 %) \nand higher K, Al, Cr, V than cluster 1. Cluster 3 contains a small group of soils \npredominantly from the north-western mine area corresponding to the mineralised \nveins and shafts, with higher As concentrations (total As median value = 11000 mg \nkg-1) than cluster 1 and cluster 2 and a percent As bioaccessibility median value of 15 \n%. Cluster 4 groups the soils from the area inside the As works and it is characterised \nby very high concentrations of As (total As median value = 30200 mg kg-1 and up to \n69000 mg kg-1), Fe and S and the lowest As bioaccessible fraction (percent As \nbioaccessibility median value = 4.2 %).  \n \nMultiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were produced for cluster 1 and cluster 2, \nwhose percent As bioaccessibility differs while As total content is similar. The total \n 14 \nelement concentration, pH and organic matter of each sample were used as the \nexplanatory variables and bioaccessible As the response variable. A forward stepwise \nprocedure [10] was used to assess which explanatory variables had a statistically \nsignificant effect on the regression and hence would be included in the final model. \nThe two models\u2019 coefficients and related statistics are summarised in Table 2 and \nTable 3 . For cluster 1, the total As content was the only explanatory variable giving a \nsignificant (p <0.001) coefficient describing 93 % of the variance in the bioaccessible \nAs. This suggests that As is mainly bound to one phase whose partial dissolution is \nresponsible for the bioaccessible content. From the results of the sequential extraction \n(sample DGC 112) it was possible to identify this phase as Fe oxyhydroxides \nadsorbing or coprecipitating As. The negative intercept in the model suggests that it is \nonly valid over the range of total As in these samples and that there is some non-\nlinearity as lower total As values are approached. For cluster 2 (Table 3), total As and \ntotal S are found to be the only explanatory variables with significant (p<0.001) \ncoefficients describing 96% of the variance in the bioaccessible As. This might \nsuggest that there is a portion of As bound to S in a non-bioaccessible form, probably \nas arsenopyrite (FeAsS), where one would expect the As to be less freely available \nand locked up in the crystal structure. Arsenopyrite, the primary ore mineral was \nbrought to the arsenic works from the various working mines as well as waste dumps \nby the railway line and along which soils from cluster 2 group. The suggested \npresence of at least two different sources of As, an Fe oxyhydroxide source for cluster \n1 and an Fe sulphide contribution for cluster 2, might explain the observed difference \nin bioaccessibility in the two groups of soils and the spatial variability. This is in \nagreement with Ruby et al. [11] who found that for constant soil particle size As in \n 15 \nsulphides has lower bioaccessibility than the As bound to Fe and manganese \noxyhydroxides. \n \n \nFe Oxyhydroxide Crystallinity and Arsenic Bioaccessibility \n \nAn overall higher bioaccessibility of As is shown by the mine soils (median percent \nbioaccessibility =15%) compared to the mineralised and background soils where As \nderives from the natural weathering of the parent material in Bere Alston and \nDrakewells (percent bioaccessibility < 10%). The latter values are similar to the \nvalues reported for naturally As enriched soils developed on the ironstones from \nNorth Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, UK. [12,13] In all cases the importance of \nthe Fe oxyhydroxides phases in hosting As in these soils was evidenced by the \nsequential chemical extraction data. As part of investigating the relationship between \nAs and Fe oxyhydroxides, a comparative trial study was carried out on a few soil \nsamples from the Devon mine site and the Northampton soils on ironstones. [14] Figure \n8 shows how the soils from Northampton with a lower percent bioaccessible As \n(<10%) contain Fe oxyhydroxides with a relatively higher degree of crystallinity \ncompared to the Devon Mine soils. The degree of Fe oxyhydroxide crystallinity may \naffect the mineral dissolution rates and the bioaccessibility of As \nadsorbed\/coprecipitated with the oxyhydroxides. However, the complexity of Fe \noxyhydroxides phases and factors affecting As coprecipitation\/adsorption processes \nnecessitates that further studies are undertaken to better understand the influence of \nvarious soil physical and chemical properties on As bioaccessibility. \n \n 16 \n \nInsights into the Solution Chemistry of PBET-extracts Applied to the Mine Soils \nfrom Devon \n \n \nThe PBET method simulates the sequential changes in the physico-chemical \nenvironment of the gastrointestinal tract, from acidic gastric conditions to neutral to \nslightly alkaline intestinal conditions. In the literature there is no agreement on the \nbenefit of carrying out the extraction test under aerobic\/anaerobic conditions. The \npresent modified version of the PBET test has been carried out in screw-top \npolypropylene vessels, in aerobic conditions. Measurements of the redox condition of \nthe extraction fluids in the PBET test indicate Eh values of around 500 mV without \nmajor changes from the stomach to the intestine phase. \n \nMobility of As in natural waters and soil solutions depends primarily on the role of \nmechanisms such as adsorption and coprecipitation on Fe oxyhydroxides. [15] Arsenic \nadsorption on Fe oxyhydroxides is pH dependent with As(V) sorption decreasing at \nalkaline pH. [16] Under reducing conditions Fe would be in a soluble ferrous state and \nAs present as As(III), which is less strongly adsorbed on Fe oxyhydroxides than \nAs(V). Under these conditions one would expect As to be highly soluble. Overall, the \ndescribed mechanisms will apply to the gastrointestinal system, but be complicated by \nthe presence of other major anions such as phosphates and organic chelants, which \nmay be as important as Fe oxyhydroxides in the mechanisms of sorption\/ \ndisplacement\/ release.  \n 17 \nThe stability phase diagram for Fe at 37 \u00b0C shows that soluble Fe(II) is the stable Fe \nspecies in the stomach phase (Fig. 9). Due to the low pH, Fe(II) is stable over a wide \nEh range and low Eh values are not so critical to ensure Fe reduction. According to \nthe same stability diagram a shift in pH towards the alkaline values of the intestine \nphase could cause colloidal ferric Fe oxyhydroxides to form and precipitate, with \nconsequent decrease of Fe and coprecipitated As from solution. However, the trend of \ndissolution observed in the stomach and intestine phases for the studied soils is \ncharacterised by an increase in As and Fe solubility passing from the stomach phase \nto the intestine phase.  \n \nConsideration of only the inorganic composition of the fluid is not sufficient to \nexplain the Fe in solution at the alkaline pH of the intestine phase. A closer look at the \nfluid composition shows the presence of important organic chelants for Fe such as \nsodium citrate and malic acid, known to improve the absorption of Fe from food, \nwhich might enhance the extent of Fe dissolution. In addition, in the intestine fluid \nbile salts and pancreatin are added. These are characterised by the presence of \nphosphorous. Arsenate release as a result of ligand-exchange reactions of arsenate \nwith phosphate ions could also represent an important mechanism. [17-19]. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nMine soils from Devon Great Consols Mine exhibited higher As bioaccessibility than \nthe soils not affected by mining activities and background soils within the Tamar \ncatchment.  \n 18 \nThe sequential extraction data showed that As is mainly bound to Fe oxyhydroxides \nfor most of the soils. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated the presence of at least \ntwo mineralogical phases (Fe oxyhydroxides and Fe sulphides) to affect the \nbioaccessibility of As in these soils. Preliminary results on Fe oxyhydroxide \ncrystallinity suggested that the degree of Fe oxyhydroxide crystallinity influences \ndissolution rate and As bioaccessibility.  \nThe solution chemistry of the PBET extracts was studied and the increasing trend of \ndissolution of both As and Fe at increasing pH from the stomach to the intestine phase \nsuggested the major role of organic chelants during the PBET extraction of As. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \n \nThis study is published with the permission of the Director, British Geological Survey \n(NERC).
