In recent years, we suggest that this balance can be characterised increasingly\nas \u2018child-centric\u2019, less concerned with families and more focused on individual children and\ntheir needs. This article charts the changes in families and government responses over the last\n40 years, and the way this is reflected in organisational and administrative arrangements. It\nnotes in particular the impact on everyday practice of the introduction of information and\ncommunication technologies. Findings are reported from recent research which shows the\nstruggles faced by practitioners who try to manage systems which separate children from their\nfamilial, social and relational contexts. As a consequence, we suggest, the work has become\nincreasingly fragmented and less mindful of children\u2019s life within families. While the data and\nanalysis draw on research carried out in England, we suggest that similar changes may be going\non in other Western liberal democracies.\nIntroduction\nSince the late nineteenth century, England, along with most Western liberal\ndemocracies, has developed policy and practice in child welfare with the intent\nto ensure that the state is able to intervene in the privacy of the family in order\nto protect children, while at the same time supporting the family as the key\ninstitution for rearing children. It is our argument that in recent years we have\nwitnessed a shift in the way this fine balance is managed. In particular, there is an\nincreasing emphasis on the importance of policy and practice being underpinned\nby and organised in ways that are explicitly \u2018child-centred\u2019. These developments\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n394 christopher hall et al.\nare particularly evident in England, with the recent creation of local authority\nDepartments of Children\u2019s Services. Beyond this, we will argue that these\nnew organisational and administrative arrangements pose particular challenges\nwhere practitioners and managers struggle to locate individual children in their\nfamilial and social contexts, and where their histories and relationships are\nimportant. These challenges are particularly evident in the growing reliance upon\na range of new Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) in day-to-day\nprofessional practice, where the primary data unit is the \u2018atomised\u2019 child. This is\na major issue currently. For while government is keen, following the high-profile\ndeath of \u2018Baby Peter\u2019 (Laming, 2009), to ensure that children are kept safe (HM\nGovernment, 2009), it is also keen to emphasise the importance of children\u2019s\nservices working closely with adult services and, in particular, that they Think\nFamily (Cabinet Office, Social Exclusion Task Force, 2008).\nA community-based family service\nIt is important to remember that these developments differ from the\nphilosophy and organisation of services previously established in England. The\nreorganisation of local authority personal social services in 1971 was based on\nthe recommendations of the Seebohm Report (Seebohm, 1968). The central\nrecommendation of the Report was the establishment of a new local authority\ndepartment that would be:\na community-based and family-oriented service which would be available to all. The new\ndepartment will, we believe, reach far beyond the discovery and rescue of social casualties; it\nwill enable the greatest possible number of individuals to act reciprocally giving and receiving\nservice for the well-being of the whole community. (Ibid.: para. 2)\nThe new department would be universal in nature, focusing on the family and\ncommunity, and provide a range of personalised, generic services. An explicit\nattempt was made in establishing this new family service to ensure that all age\nranges would be included, and different needs and problems addressed in order\nto overcome previous concerns about fragmentation. Importantly, the familywas\nboth the focus of attention and the key organisational unit on which the service\nwould be based. In many ways, the Seebohm Report and the reorganisation\nof the personal social services were premised on a traditional notion of the\nnuclear family, in which the male was the breadwinner, the female took prime\nresponsibility for the domestic sphere and the rearing of children took place in a\ncontext of lifelong marriage (Rustin, 1979).\nThe subsequent 40 years have seen enormous changes in the nature and\nstructure of \u2018family\u2019 life. The number of first marriages more than halved from\n390,000 in 1975 to 175,000 in 1997, while remarriages made up two-thirds of\nthe total. The number of divorces more than doubled between 1961 and 1997,\nwhen the total was 175,000, only slightly fewer than the number of first marriages\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 395\n(ONS, 1998). Crucially, for our purposes, the proportion of children born outside\nmarriage quadrupled, and by the end of the 1980s fewer than 50 per cent of 18\u2013\n24 year-olds thought it necessary to marry before having children (Kiernan\nand Estaugh, 1993). Two-thirds of first partnerships in the early 1990s were\ncohabitations, compared with one-third 20 years earlier, and 22 per cent of\nchildren were born into cohabiting unions, compared with 2 per cent 20 years\nearlier (Ermisch and Francesconi, 1998).\nThe rate of cohabitation among couples with children reached 13 per cent in\n1998, and among those in the lowest third of the income distribution scale the\nrate was almost 26 per cent. Among couples with children who were drawing\nbenefits, it was more than two and a half times as high (Marsh et al., 2001).\nLone-parent households with dependent children increased from 2 per cent\nof the total of all households in 1961, to 7 per cent by 1979. The notion of\nlifelong marriage as the only sanctioned framework for sexual partnerships and\nparenthood had come to be seen as increasingly outmoded by the end of the\ntwentieth century. However, the failure of one relationship appears not to be a\ndeterrent to repartnering, and another increasingly common feature of \u2018family\u2019\nlife is that of \u2018social parenting\u2019, in which children are being raised in homes in\nwhich one adult, usually the father figure, is not the biological parent. Ferri et al.\nhave argued that what underlies such trends in family and personal relationships\n\u2018is the extent to which they are rooted in the changing position of women\u2019\n(2003: 302).\nA number of commentators (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002; Smart and\nNeale, 1999) have argued that these changes have shifted the basis of interpersonal\nrelationships from the nuclei to networks, so that what is increasingly left are\n\u2018partnerships\u2019. In the process, sexuality has been decoupled from marriage, and\nincreasingly becomes something to be discovered, moulded and altered. No\nlonger aremarriage and parenthood seen as being tied together, for having a child\nis increasingly separate from decisions about marriage for increasing numbers\nof people. In addition, and for the first time, fertility rates are now often below\nthe threshold for generational replacement, and the number of children in the\npopulation has been reducing in both absolute and relative terms as people live\nlonger. Consequently, the value of each child, both emotionally and economically,\nis much greater than previously.\nThemodel of the \u2018normal\u2019 nuclear family, based on the institution of lifelong\nmarriage and premised on themale-breadwinnermodel, by the late 1990s seemed\noutmoded, and the changes have increasingly been taken into account in the way\npolicy and practice in child welfare have been thought about and organised.\nRather than the focus of attention being primarily on \u2018the family\u2019, as previously,\nchildren have increasingly been seen as important in their own right. In addition,\nthe period since the early 1970s has also seen increasing anxieties about children\nand childhood.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n396 christopher hall et al.\nThis has been most evident in relation to a series of high-profile child abuse\ninquiries, where children have died at the hands of their parents and carers. A\nmajor concern has been that professionals were too concerned with the views\nand interests of the parents and not sufficiently cognisant of the needs and wishes\nof the children (Parton, 2006). In particular, children were seen as \u2018objects of\nconcern\u2019 rather than \u2018subjects\u2019 in their own right (Secretary of State for Social\nServices, 1988). These concerns were addressed in the Children Act 1989, where\nthere was a focus on the \u2018welfare of the child\u2019, particularly where a \u2018child was\nin need\u2019 (Parton, 1991). Guidance to professionals has increasingly stressed the\nimportance of seeing and talking with children separately, and recognising that\ntheir \u2018needs\u2019 and \u2018interests\u2019, while related to those of their parents, need to be\nidentified and assessed separately.\nIndividualising \u2018children in need\u2019\nInitially, in the early 1990s, the children \u2018in need\u2019 who were considered especially\nvulnerable were children \u2018looked after\u2019 away from home and for whom the local\nauthority assumed a degree of parental responsibility. The development of the\n\u2018Looking After Children\u2019 (LAC) project proved key in developing a whole range\nof new assessment technologies in which individual children are the focus. The\nproject (Parker et al., 1991) was prompted by growing political concerns about\nresidential care for children and scandals that received wide media coverage in\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s (Corby et al., 2001). It was seen as vital that local\nauthorities fulfilled their responsibilities as \u2018corporate parents\u2019 to the children\nand young people they looked after (Jackson and Kilroe, 1996).\nSeven \u2018developmental dimensions\u2019 were identified as key to achieving long-\nterm \u2018well-being\u2019 for children: health, education, identity, family and peer\nrelationships, emotional andbehavioural development, self-care and competence\nand social presentation.\nThe components of the LAC systemwere a series of six age-related assessment\nand action records (AARs), and within the seven developmental dimensions the\nAARs set specific age-related objectives for children\u2019s progress. The AARs were\nset within a system for gathering information and reviewing children\u2019s cases\nthat would provide baseline information about the specific needs of individual\nchildren. While the AARs were initially implemented as a practice tool, this was\nsecondary to their original purpose, which was to provide local authorities with a\nsystematic means of gathering information that would enable them to assess the\noutcomes of \u2018looked-after\u2019 children. Information on individual children could be\naggregated to provide management with a means of assessing the effectiveness of\nthe service as a whole. The LAC systemwas based on a very particular approach to\nchild development. AsWinter argues, \u2018the framework and its associatedmaterials\nare basedupon aparticularmodel of child development that emphasises universal\nand invariant age-related developmental stages\u2019 (2006: 56).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 397\nWhile originally introduced specifically for use with children \u2018looked after\u2019\nby a local authority, by the late 1990s local authority managers, researchers\nand senior civil servants began to examine how far the LAC system could\nbe adapted to develop similar tools for assessing outcomes for other children\nwho, while not \u2018looked after\u2019, were using local authority children\u2019s services.\nThey could be developed for audit purposes rather than merely case recording\n(Gatehouse et al., 2004). The development of the LAC system in the 1990s\nprovided the crucial foundation for the development of subsequent systems\ndesigned to assess a potentially much wider range of children and their parents\nand also provide mechanisms for integrating services and sharing information\namong professionals. It was foundational in the development of the Assessment\nFramework for Children in Need and their Families (DH, 2000), the Integrated\nChildren\u2019s System (Cleaver et al., 2008), and the Common Assessment Framework\n(CAF) (CWDC, 2007).\nThe Assessment Framework was represented by a triangle made up of\nthree dimensions: the child\u2019s developmental needs, parental capacity and family\nand environmental factors. At the centre of the triangle, and the focus of\nthe assessment, was the individual child. Only through an assessment of the\ninterrelationships between the three dimensions was it possible to assess and\nidentify the \u2018needs\u2019 of any particular child.\nGoverning childhood under New Labour\nTheNewLabour government inMay 1997 took these developments to a new level.\nFrom the beginning, New Labour focused on modernising welfare policy, and\nplacedpolicies related to children and youngpeople at the heart of its programme.\nAs a number of commentators have argued, the New Labour government has\npursued a more \u2018active\u2019 approach to social entitlements for adults by drawing\na tighter link between employment and social provision, and a stricter \u2018social\ninvestment\u2019 approach to social spending in general (Powell, 2008). In this context,\nconsiderable attention has focused on children as future citizens andmaximising\ntheir educational and employment potential (Lister, 2006) togetherwith ensuring\nthey do not engage in criminal or anti-social behaviour (James and James,\n2004).\nIn many respects, a major development with New Labour was its decision to\naccept and work with the grain and direction of social change evident within the\n\u2018family\u2019 and the growing individualisation in social and community life (Lewis,\n2007). Rather than seeing its prime focus as attempting to strengthen marriage\nand the family, the government has prioritised policies primarily concerned with\nimproving the life chances and well-being of children, particularly providing\nthem with secure and stable parental relationships and attachments (Lewis,\n2001). Policy has, therefore, subtly but significantly shifted from a focus on\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n398 christopher hall et al.\nthe family to one which is concerned directly with childhood vulnerability and\nwell-being, and upholding parental responsibility. Childhood has moved to the\ncentre of policy priorities, seen as lying at the fulcrum of attempts to tackle social\nexclusion and the investment in a positive, creative and wealth-creating future,\nand many of the challenges posed by the social and economic changes related to\nglobalisation.\nPreviously the family was seen as the central building block of society and\na key instrument of government, but this has now changed in important ways.\nBecause the family has been both deconstructed and disaggregated, children and\nparents (both men and women) are seen to inhabit separate worlds with separate\ninterests. However, they are locked together both legally and emotionally. Under\nNewLabour, parents have responsibilities to their children,which theymust carry\nout on behalf of the wider community, and it is the child\u2019s overall welfare and\ndevelopment that is theoverriding concern. Inorder to fulfil these responsibilities,\nparents do not need to be married or even live together. In recognising the\nreality of changing family life, a much greater emphasis has therefore been\nplaced on the importance of parental responsibility. While \u2018partnering\u2019 is seen\nas primarily a private matter, subject to individual freedom of action and\nchoice, \u2018parenting\u2019 is very much a public concern and therefore a legitimate\nsite for state intervention. These processes of increased individualisation have\nhelped to create the social conditions that have made it possible for children\nto gain more protection, initially within the family and subsequently in other\ninstitutions. The process of individualisation not only disaggregates the family,\nbut also recognises that children have a right to a life, a biography and\nautonomy; hence there is an increased emphasis on the views and rights of\nchildren.\nIn organisational child welfare terms, we see an important shift away from\nservices which are framed primarily in terms of \u2018the family\u2019, to ones which\nare explicitly \u2018child-centred\u2019. Not only is this represented by the change from\nsocial service departments to departments of children\u2019s services, but also in the\nway the technologies and administrative systems are themselves organised and\narticulated. This was perhaps made most explicit by the green paper Every Child\nMatters (Chief Secretary to the Treasury, 2003), which states the government\u2019s\nintention \u2018to put children at the heart of our policies, and to organise services\naround their needs\u2019 (p. 9). As noted in the previous section, it was also evident in\nthe Looking After Children (LAC) documentation and the Assessment Framework,\nwhere it is the \u2018child in need\u2019 who is placed at the centre of the systems. A key\nunit of organisation becomes the individual child, and it is children as opposed\nto \u2018the family\u2019 that is the primary focus of government.\nWhile the focus of this article is changes in child welfare policy and\npractice, we suggest that it provides an interesting exemplar of some of the\nmore wide-ranging recent changes in the relationships between children, parents\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 399\nFigure 1. The triangular relationship of state-child-parents (adapted from Dencik, 1989).\nand the state. Lars Dencik (1989) has argued that when sociologists of the\nfamily have talked about the family\u2019s function in society, it has usually been\nanalysed as a two-sided relationship, and children were seen as part of the\nfamily with parents acting as their spokesperson. However, this has gradually\nbeen superseded by a new development that he has called an \u2018eternal triangle\u2019,\nin which the state on one base has a triangular relationship with the parents\non another base of the pyramid and children on the third, as well as parents\nand children having their own separate set of relationships. The implication\nof this important shift becomes even more evident with the introduction\nof a whole variety of new information technology (ICT) systems, which are\ndesigned to store information and aid communication in relation to individual\nchildren.\nICTs in child welfare in England\nWe will examine two systems which draw on concepts of child need introduced\nin the LAC, namely theCommonAssessment Framework (CAF) and the Integrated\nChildren\u2019s System (ICS). By early 2010, the ICS and CAF had been widely\nimplemented, although some local authorities still used paper versions of\nthe forms rather than the electronic versions. The authors have carried out\nresearch into these systems: the e-Assessment project looked at the CAF, and\nthe Error project investigated the ICS.1 Details of these studies can be found\non the ESRC Society Today website, and in various publications (for example,\nBroadhurst et al., 2009; Peckover et al., 2008, 2009; Pithouse et al., 2009; White\net al., 2009). We will draw on data from this research, together with government-\nsponsored evaluations (Cleaver et al., 2004; Brandon et al., 2006; Bell et al.,\n2007), to examine the ways in which the technologies have been developed.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n400 christopher hall et al.\nWe will pay particular attention to how versions of children, child need and\nfamilies are structured in the software, and the dilemmas posed for managers\nand practitioners.\nThe Common Assessment Framework (CAF)\nTheCAF is a standard assessment formusedby all childwelfare professionals.\nIt can be completed as a Word template, but is increasingly being held on\nlocal databases to enable electronic transfer between professionals. Following\nthe format established by the Assessment Framework of Children in Need and their\nFamilies, it encourages the assessment of three aspects of the child \u2013 their personal\ndevelopment, parenting and their family and environment \u2013 under 19 topics, with\nguidance as to what information should be included. A CAF is to be completed\nfor each child and focuses on their \u2018needs\u2019 and \u2018strengths\u2019. Children\u2019s and parents\u2019\ncomments and their consent to share the assessment can be recorded.\nThe CAF is seen as an early assessment of a child\u2019s needs and concerns, to be\ncompleted particularly by schools, GPs and health and early years\u2019 professionals.\nPractitioners are encouraged to consider whether the child\u2019s needs can be met\nfrom within their own resources and, if not, the CAF can be used as a referral to\nanother service. It was piloted in 12 local authorities (Brandon et al., 2006).\nThe structure of the assessment section provides topics mainly about\nthe child. Twelve of the 19 boxes are about the child\u2019s health, education and\ndevelopment. Three are concerned with \u2018Parenting\u2019: \u2018Basic care, ensuring safety\nand protection\u2019, \u2018Emotional warmth and stability\u2019 and \u2018Guidance, boundaries\nand stimulation\u2019. In the final section, \u2018Family and environmental\u2019, there are\nfour headings, one labelled \u2018Family history, functioning and well-being\u2019 with\nthe longest list of prompts: \u2018illness, bereavement, violence, parental substance\nmisuse, criminality, anti-social behaviour, culture, etc.\u2019. It appears as a residual\nsection, enabling theCAFwriter to addwhatever aspects hadnot been included in\nother sections. There is nowhere to record information about relations between\nsiblings. There is a section at the beginning labelled \u2018Current family and home\nsituation\u2019 to identify siblings and \u2018significant adults\u2019 for setting the scene, but it\nis not part of the assessment.\nThe CAF is \u2018child-focused\u2019, with opportunities to write about the family\nproblems and interactions restricted. As government guidance makes clear:\n\u2018The CAF is a standardised approach to conducting an assessment of a child\u2019s\nadditional needs and deciding how those needs should be met\u2019 (CWDC,\n2007: 6).\nThe central aim is to support the sharing of information about children\nbetween professional groups, what is sometimes referred as a \u2018common language\u2019\n(Axford et al., 2006), so that practitioners can understand how others are\nreporting about children. The concept of \u2018child need\u2019 is identified as the way\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 401\nto achieve this, since all appropriate practitioners are considered, with training,\nto be able to identify and write about \u2018needs\u2019 in a similar way.\nIntegrated Children\u2019s System (ICS)\nThe ICS is the client record system of children\u2019s social care. It is described\non the DCSF website (2008a):\nIt provides a conceptual framework, a method of practice and a business process to support\npractitioners and managers in undertaking the key tasks of assessment, planning, intervention\nand review.\nIt is completed by social workers and managers and has a series of electronic\nforms and case records for assessments, planning and reviews of children at\nreferral, in \u2018child protection\u2019, for \u2018children in need\u2019 and for those \u2018looked after\u2019.\nAs with the CAF, there is a no family file, but a separate file for each child,\nalthough there are electronic links to family members. Underpinning the ICS\nare particular approaches to child development and how children are to be\nwritten about. As the DCSF website notes, it is based on \u2018an understanding of\nchildren\u2019s developmental needs in the context of parental capacity and wider\nfamily and environmental factors\u2019, linking the ICS to the genealogy of LAC, the\nFramework for the Assessment of Children and their Families, and CAF. This is\na complex IT system which incorporates several tasks. First, it is an electronic\ncase file with a running record, reports, meeting minutes, letters and so on,\nas expected of social work case files. Paper items can be scanned in. Second,\nit is an assessment system with \u2018exemplars\u2019 that share features of the earlier\nLAC and Assessment Framework forms. Third, it is a decision-making system,\nwith functions to request decisions from managers: for example, to \u2018sign off\u2019\nassessments. Fourth, it includes functions to produce statistics of completed\ntasks for audit and performance management. The case file is no longer located\nin filing cabinets but available to all personnel with authorisation to access,\nclearly delineating a change from the personal ownership of practitioners to\ninstitutional-wide scrutiny (Hall et al., 2006: 90).\nThe Core Assessment exemplar in the ICS is a major assessment of a child\nto be completed in 35 days. Examples are provided in Figures 2 and 3 from the\nDCSF website (2008b). Each local authority\u2019s versionmay vary in format, but the\ntopics and prompts are similar. Like the LAC forms, there are prompt questions\nfor each topic and different forms for different age groups. It is much longer than\nthe CAF (28 pages compared with eight for the CAF). While built around the\nnow familiar topics of the \u2018child\u2019s developmental needs\u2019 and \u2018parenting capacity\u2019,\neach of the child\u2019s needs has associated questions about the \u2018parental capacity to\nmeet needs\u2019, as seen in Figure 2. In contrast to the CAF, parenting is to be written\nabout in terms of specified needs of the child.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n402 christopher hall et al.\nFigure 2. Health: parental capacity.\nFigure 3. Parents\u2019\/carers\u2019 attributes and the impact on their capacity to ensure the child\u2019s safety\nfrom harm and to respond appropriately to his\/her needs.\nThe next major section is headed \u2018Parents\/Carers Attributes and the Impact\non their capacity to ensure the child\u2019s safety from harm and to respond\nappropriately to his\/her needs\u2019. There follows a series of topics which suggest\npossible deficits or disabilities of the parent (see Figure 3), but the writer is\nencouraged to assess how they affect the child. The writer is asked to record\n\u2018strengths and difficulties\u2019 of each adult, but this is a section organised around\nproblems. It is not clear how strengths are to be associated with, for example,\n\u2018known history of violence\u2019.\nSimilarly, with the \u2018Family and environmental factors\u2019 section, the writer is\nasked to assess the impact on the child\u2019s needs and parenting capacity. As with\nthe CAF, there is a series of topics related to the family\u2019s circumstances: housing,\nincome, social integration, access to community resources and support of wider\nfamily. The question about \u2018family functioning\u2019 again relates to potential risks to\nthe child.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 403\nWhat becomes apparent is that the structure of the Core Assessment\nencourages a fragmented view of \u2018the family\u2019. The child is constructed through\na series of boxes which list \u2018needs\u2019. Parents or carers are constructed in terms of\nhow they address those needs, and parental attributes are seen in terms of deficits\nand difficulties. There is nowhere to write about relations with siblings or friends,\nexcept in negative terms under \u2018family functioning\u2019, where \u2018The young person\u2019s\nimpairment\/behaviour has a negative impact on siblings.\u2019 The child is viewed as\nhaving a set of attributes and problems, but these are to be reported in isolation\nfrom issues concerning their families or communities.\nIn summary, the CAF and ICS are \u2018child-centric\u2019 in that writers are required\nto assess the needs of individual children expressed in terms of their health,\neducation and personal development. They are restricted in the ways they can\ncomment on the parents\u2019\/carers\u2019 problems or family relations. We are suggesting\nthat such formulations are new and based on new ways of viewing the state\u2019s and\nparents\u2019 responsibilities for the upbringing and well-being of children.\nUsing the ICTs\nIn the final section, we will examine the problems practitioners face when using\nchild-centric ICTs. Overall, the development of ICTs in everydaywork is reported\nby child welfare practitioners to be cumbersome, deskilling and challenging\nprofessional judgement. In contrast to the relational work with children and\nparents, which they see as \u2018the real work\u2019, time at the computer is seen as an\nunnecessary distraction (see Bell et al., 2007: 8).\nConcerns versus needs\nWhile \u2018child need\u2019 appears in policy and guidance as unproblematic, when\napplied in everyday practice it is not straightforward. A clear statement about\nthe centrality of \u2018needs\u2019 is made in a government-sponsored evaluation, making\na distinction between \u2018needs\u2019 and \u2018concerns\u2019 as the basis for sharing information:\nthere are important practical and philosophical differences between recording a child\u2019s needs\nand recording practitioner\u2019s concerns. Practitioner\u2019s concerns are probably an extremely\nsensitive way of highlighting children who may need closer scrutiny. However, they are also\nlikely to be intangible, transient and not directly evidence based. As such, they may be harder\nto justify or back up and are more open to misrepresentation. Child\u2019s needs are necessarily\nevidence based. A practitioner has to assess and analyse concerns\/evidence before needs can be\nidentified. Recording needs is therefore more robust and objective but at the risk of being less\nsensitive. (Cleaver et al., 2004: 54)\nIdentifying a \u2018child\u2019s needs\u2019, it is suggested, is more \u2018robust and objective\u2019, having\nbeen subjected to an assessment of available evidence.\nHowever, many respondents did not consider \u2018child need\u2019 a straightforward\nor appropriate concept. In contradiction to Cleaver et al.\u2019s recommendations, in\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n404 christopher hall et al.\nTABLE 1. CAF form\nEmotional and behavioural development\nNeeds Disruptive and challenging behaviour at school. Finds it difficult to cope and\nmanage frustration\nour e-Assessment research professionals were more likely to write about children\nin terms of \u2018concerns\u2019. We analysed 280 CAFs and found that writers used the\nlanguage of \u2018need\u2019 in 54 per cent of the sample, whereas they described \u2018concerns\u2019\nin 84 per cent. For example, in Table 1, the section on \u2018Needs\u2019 in terms of\n\u2018Emotional and Behavioural Development\u2019, a youth worker describes concerns\nabout a young person by describing his behaviour.\nAnumber of respondents noted the difficulty of delineating the child\u2019s \u2018need\u2019.\nIt was seen as not really telling the \u2018reader\u2019 what the issues were.\nTeacher: So I don\u2019t think the needs bit is terribly useful; I think it needs to be a different\ntype of word.\nInterviewer: So what . . .\nTeacher: I don\u2019t know [laughter] what I have put there, I have described the teacher\nbeing worried about something I mean that isn\u2019t a need but if I put the need in, I am\nnot really stating what the issue is, do you see what I mean. It\u2019s kind of got this concern\nthat if you just put in what the need is, which I have put in later on is that he needs to\nfeel safe and he needs you know, so if I stick that there it\u2019s not really telling the person\nwho is reading it what the issue is. Maybe it needs to be strengths and issues rather\nthan strengths and needs. Or maybe it needs to be strengths, issues and needs because\npeople are having difficulty with that because you need to write in what the concerns\nare.\nAlso, \u2018need\u2019 was seen as not enabling the writer to provide appropriate contextual\ninformation:\nTeacher: We are being specific about what this child needs and the worry is if you only\nhome in on the needs without contextual information you are not going to appreciate\nthe gravity of why all those things are important.\nEven social workers, who have been familiar with the concept of \u2018child need\u2019 for\nsome time, do not always find it easy to fit the assessments into ICTs (Bell et al.,\n2007: 42).\nSplitting up families\nOur central argument is, in being \u2018child-centred\u2019, ICTs disaggregate and\nfragment the family. There is no longer a \u2018family file\u2019 but, moreover, the\nassessments restrict the descriptions of family or parental issues.\nAs has been the case for many years, practitioners approach children\u2019s\nproblems as being linked to their family contexts, responses to which have been a\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 405\ncore element of their work (Rustin, 1979; Parsloe and Stevenson, 1978; Satyamurti,\n1981). A Sure Start worker highlighted the problem of writing a CAF for a mother\nwho was struggling but whose care of her child was not in question.\nSure Start worker: The issues were really around her depression. She was struggling\nwith her own emotions most of the time, was very emotional and weepy, but I have no\nconcerns for the children and the school had no concerns for the boy, but her health\nvisitor was concerned about mum herself.\nBy only describing the child\u2019s needs, the CAF writer considers she was unable to\ndescribe crucial problems faced by the mother. Similarly, for one ICS writer, the\nboxes restrict how parents are written about:\nSocial worker: With the Core Assessment right at the end you have a summary box\nwhere you can reallymake a distinction, I find, with the child\u2019s needs and the parenting.\nI think right at the very end there\u2019s a parenting summary, yes, so you have a whole\nsection here where you can define any specifics about parenting capacity, like with that\ncase for example I would say here that the parent has depression, I suppose this is where\nI would probably talk about it, and your observations of that, \u2018yes mum is really coping\nwith parenting even though she\u2019s got depression\u2019. So I find in this part here you can\nsort out and tease out things especially with the observation and you can put your own\nviews here. But within the Form itself sometimes it\u2019s hard to differentiate and separate\nout because you have to repeat yourself a number of times, the same information over\nand over again.\nAs with the CAF, the ICS requires a description of the child\u2019s needs. It was shown\nin Figure 3 that the parents\u2019 problems can be completed in a separate section, but\nthe writer is again restricted to predetermined boxes. In this quote, we can see the\nsocial worker interpreting the question about family issues in terms of \u2018parenting\ncapacity\u2019, but then describes the mother\u2019s depression. She then complains about\nthe restrictive nature of the boxes, an issue raised by Bell et al. (2007: 6).\nThe loss of the family perspective is also emphasised in the government-\nsponsored ICS evaluation (ibid.: 12). Two thirds of social work respondents to\na questionnaire agreed with the statement the \u2018ICS loses the family perspective\u2019\n(ibid., 2007: 78) and in focus groups a typical comment was the loss of a \u2018holistic\nview of the family\u2019 (ibid., 2007: 59). The evaluation recommends changes to the\nICS that includes a \u2018pen picture of the family\u2019 (ibid.: 12). Our view, however, is\nthis is not just an omission but related to the child-centric policies that underpin\nthe systems.\nTelling stories\nMuch has been written about the way that professionals use narrative to talk\nand write about children and families (Hall, 1997; White et al., 2009; Pithouse\nand Atkinson, 1988). Indeed, many writers have suggested that storytelling is\na central method of making sense of the world (see Gubrium and Holstein,\n1998: 163). A narrative provides an overall formulation within which to locate\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n406 christopher hall et al.\nTABLE 2.

Hurwitz (2000: 2086) describes how a\nGP pieces together bits of information to create an understanding of patients\u2019\ndescriptions of their complaints. ICTs, however, undermine narrative (Lash, 2001;\nAas, 2005; Parton, 2008), splitting the story into bits of information without\nan integrating structure. In a database, information is \u2018stacked\u2019, combining\n\u2018various items according to whim, without any sense of internal development\nor progression and direction\u2019 (Aas, 2005: 85). The reader locates bits of the child\nand family which aremade available, but there will always be gaps, as the database\ndoes not have a sense of completeness. In the CAF, the structure of the boxes with\nheadings is seen as fragmenting the child and family:\nHealth visitor: And a CAF doesn\u2019t tell a story. It feels to me a bit like school exams.\nMultiple choice. You can tick the boxes with the right answer, but it really doesn\u2019t give\nyou . . . the story. It is about narrative, isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s about people\u2019s lives. It ISN\u2019T about\ndividing a life up into a lot of small boxes and when you put all those boxes together it\nwill be equal to the narrative.\nHowever, professionals often ignore the structures of the ICT and insert the\nnarrative. In our e-Assessment project, nearly half of the CAFs structured some\nof the information in narrative form and over a third related a story to illustrate\ntheir point (White et al., 2009). For example, in Table 2 a teacher completes the\nSummary of a CAF entirely in the form of a story.\nWriting a CAF in this way uses an incident of a lunch bag to depict what is\nsuggested as evidence of a pattern of neglect. It is not a statement of the child\u2019s\n\u2018needs\u2019, but illustrates in story form a set of behaviours by the parents and their ef-\nfect on the child. It produces a picture of family interaction, between the child and\nher brother and children and parents, inways that the structure of theCAF resists.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 407\nThe ICS also undermines the story. As respondents to the ICS evaluation\nnoted, \u2018the business of assessment was one of collecting unrelated pieces of\ninformation\u2019 (Bell et al., 2007: 61), echoing the \u2018stacking\u2019 of the database\nmentioned earlier. The loss of the narrative was bemoaned by nearly three\nquarters of respondents (ibid., 2007: 78) and the evaluators considered that\n\u2018telling the story is an essential part of the social work process\u2019 (ibid., 2007: 99).\nWe see this loss of narrative as a significant impact of the introduction of current\nICT systems into child welfare practice.\nWriting for audiences\nIn a paper entitled \u2018Good Organisational Reasons for \u201cBad\u201d Clinic Records\u2019,\nGarfinkel (1967) describes how records from a psychiatric clinic are frequently\nincomplete in terms of basic information (age, ethnic original, occupation and\nso on). He suggests this is because such records are concerned to describe and\njustify a therapeutic encounter for later readers:\nIn our view, the contents of clinic folders are assembled with regard for the possibility that the\nrelationshipmayhave tobeportrayed as havingbeen in accordwith expectations of sanctionable\nperformances by clinicians and patients. (1967: 199)\nOrganisational records are constructed for particular audiences rather than\nas ends in themselves. There are potentially several audiences of children\u2019s\nICTs\u2013managers, auditors, parents, children, otherprofessionals, politicians\u2013 and\nincreasingly these diverse audiences have access to organisational records or the\nresulting performance tables. However, following Garfinkel, we suggest that any\norganisational record addresses \u2018entitled\u2019 readers (1967: 201). The writer attunes\nhow they report their assessments to the sensibilities of particular audiences, and\nas such they are negotiated documents.\nIn some cases, the audience is the parent. Government guidance on the CAF\ninstructs thewriter to complete theCAFwith the child andparents (CWDC, 2007:\n19). Writing the document describes a child and family, but also engages with\nthem. For example, a teacher describes the sensitivity of the negotiation process:\nTeacher: It does not include information about our real concerns about the parenting\ncapacity, which perhaps the next time around we\u2019ll amend it. I felt that my decision on\nthis occasion was that I needed as much backing from the parents as possible to get a\nstatement from [parent] and that I would only aggravate things if I put in information\nthat would upset them.\nTo gain the cooperation of the parents in subsequent interventions, the teacher\navoided spelling out her \u2018real concerns\u2019.\nIt has also been noted the extent to which the CAF is written as a referral for\nother professionals rather than as an assessment (Brandon et al., 2006). In our\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n408 christopher hall et al.\ne-Assessment research (White et al., 2009), two thirds of the 280 CAFs were used\nfor referral and inevitably were written with the concerns of the receiver in mind.\nEducation worker: And sometimes the [name] team they are not always that happy\nto work with families if there are loads of other agencies involved. So you know you\nmight concentrate more on the child\u2019s problems and their behaviour than you might\nonmum\u2019s problemswith the house because you don\u2019t want them to think \u2018well actually\nyou need a family support worker first\u2019 . . . so that makes it a less objective form really,\ndoesn\u2019t it, if we are filling it in with different kinds of ends in mind.\nThe ICS, on the other, hand was seen by social workers as having an uncertain\naudience. It is too \u2018lengthy and overwhelming\u2019 to share with parents and children\n(Bell et al., 2007: 62). In fact, in our Error research, social workers were not sure\nif anyone read them:\nSocial worker: I\u2019ve not yet met a family who\u2019s gone through my Core Assessment and\nread it.\nInterviewer: So who are they for?\nSocial worker: Exactly, that\u2019s something I struggle with, I don\u2019t know. I think when I\u2019ve\npicked up a case that\u2019s already had a Core Assessment on it done, I read the Analysis\nand the Summary boxes and most other managers and people at different levels when\nthey do auditing that\u2019s what they look at.\nTheCoreAssessment is seen as too long to be read by parents, and other informed\nreaders only look at key sections. Similarly, for reports to child protection\nconferences, the chair of conference does not read everything, particularly as\nseparate reports have to be prepared on all the children involved:\nSocial worker: I have certainly heard people say: \u2018ok, give me the youngest child\u2019s and\nthe oldest child\u2019s and I will just read them. But because largely the issues are going to\nbe the same and if there is anything for the individual child on the other children in\nthat instant then you know tell me about it but otherwise I am only going to read two\nof the reports\u2019. And again that is quite disheartening because again I\u2019m compelled to\nwrite 7 conference reports for quality assurance . . . But you just think, \u2018well, why are\nwe compelled to write this way; why can\u2019t we write one report for the family and then\njust have individual sections for the children, you know.\u2019 I mean, everybody tears their\nhair out with it, I think.\nWhat is particularly interesting about these comments is that the social worker\nsees the ICS formsprimarily for \u2018audit\u2019 or \u2018quality assurance\u2019 purposes. The reader\nis not those actively involved in the day-to-day decision-making but, as Garfinkel\nsays, \u2018later readers\u2019. A respondent to Bell et al. (2007: 63) saw the information as\nrequired for \u2018some statistician somewhere\u2019. The current changes are part ofmuch\ngreater emphasis upon the accountability and surveillance of practitioners and\nchildren, young people and parents with whom they work (Parton, 2006, 2008).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\nchild-centric icts 409\nConclusion\nWe have argued in this article that we can identify a significant shift in the\nrelationships between the state and family in recent years, which is exemplified in\nthe emergence of a \u2018child-centric\u2019 focus in child welfare policy and practice. Such\nchanges have become far more embedded in day-to-day organisational practices\nvia the introduction of a range of new ICT systems in recent years. At one level,\nsuch changes can increase the potential surveillance capacities of statutory child\nwelfare agencies in relation to the children, young people and parents with whom\nthey come into contact and the frontline professionals who are responsible for\nimplementing the policies.\nAt the same time, and this has been the prime focus of this article, the\nintroduction of child-centric ICTs into child welfare has posed a number of\nfundamental challenges, particularly for practitioners. Evidence from research\nsuggests that the new systems make it very difficult to locate children in their\nfamilial, social and relational contexts, and that the work has become increasingly\nfragmented as a result. Far from supporting a practice which is centred on the\ncontexts in which children live and the concerns which professionals might have\nabout them, the new ICT systems are having the effect of distancing professionals\nfrom the lived day-to-day experiences of the people with whom they work. Since\nthe research discussed here has been completed, these issues have become a\nmajor focus for political and professional debate. Prompted by a request from\nthe Secretary of State and critical comments by Lord Laming in his report on child\nprotection in England (Laming, 2009), the newly established Social Work Task\nForcehas identified the need for amajor reformof the IntegratedChildren\u2019s System\n(ICS) (Social Work Task Force, 2009). In particular, social workers reported to\nthe Task Force that the new ICT systems were not supporting them in their\nwork. The bureaucratic demands arising from the new systems had increased\nto such an extent that they were failing to support their professional judgement\nand were having the effect of removing them from direct contact with children\nand young people. The atomised and fragmented nature of the information\nrequired and the mechanisms for both inputting and accessing it were such that\nit had become very difficult to identify the key relational and social nature of the\nwork.\nIn addition, the voices and experiences of children and young people\nthemselves are in great danger of being marginalised: a development which is\nparticularly ironic for a system that aims to place children at the centre of policy\nand practice. However, the way in which the \u2018child-centric\u2019 systems have been\ndeveloped andoperationalised is based, almost exclusively, on an administratively\ndetermined psychologised view of children with little room for other voices\nand perspectives and little space for debate and negotiation, by children and\nyoung people as well as professionals. In many ways the thinking behind the\ndevelopment sees children in very instrumental ways: as the objects of a variety\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 21 Feb 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.6\n410 christopher hall et al.\nof concerns which need to be acted upon rather than agents of their own lives. In\nthis respect, it is not just the \u2018family\u2019 and professional practice which has become\nfragmented, but children themselves. Increasingly, it seems we are attempting\nto create \u2018electronic children\u2019 (Peckover et al., 2008) which then stand as the\nkey markers for access to resources, services and power and which may well be\nunknown to the children and young people for which they act as referents.\nIf we are serious about wanting to recognise the needs and views of children,\nit is important that we conceive of them as agents with rights to fully participate\nin the decisions made about them and also as holding citizenship claims over the\nresources which are available to them. As one of us has argued previously, recent\ndevelopments in England have not been sufficiently concerned with developing\nchildren\u2019s rights as citizens:\nThe challenge is to ensure that the systems being introduced do not become inherently complex\nand unstable, and are subject to human control, so that they become the vehicles for the\nincreased safety and emancipation of children and young people, rather than their opposite.\n(Parton, 2006: 187).\nIt is not the purpose of this article to deny that ICTs can support and enhance\nprofessional practice in child welfare. However, this requires systems to be\ndesigned in such a way that they are attuned to the working environment of the\nusers (practitioners, children and families), and not seen primarily as trying to\nre-engineer that environment. There is considerable work in user-centred design\nand human\u2013computer interaction, which seems to be missing from current\npractices in child welfare (White et al., forthcoming). Systems can be designed\nwhich support professional reflection and promote user involvement by, for\nexample, enabling some of the literary practices of professionals described in our\nresearch: telling stories, expressing concerns about children, addressing specific\naudiences. The purpose of assessing and sharing information about children\nand their families is to facilitate the mutual understanding of professionals and\nsupport decision-making. It is for them to judge whether ICTs have enhanced\nsuch processes and, as we have described, their assessments of current systems\nare highly critical.\nNote\n1 Two research projects have been funded by the UK Economic and Social Research\nCouncil.
