Educational Studies is available online at: \nhttp:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals\/CARFAX\/03055698.html.  \n \n \nPerpetrating Disaffection: Schooling as an International Problem \n \nClive Harber, University of Birmingham \n(Contact Address: School of Education, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, \nBirmingham B15 2TT) \n \n\u2018Schooling worldwide is characterised by misery, boredom, bullying, deceit, anxiety, \nhumiliation, brutalisation, ethnic \u2013 and many other types of \u2013 discrimination, religious \n\u2013 and many other forms of \u2013 indoctrination, sexual \u2013 and many other kinds of \u2013 \nexploitation, and testing to destruction. It should not be like that. It should be fun.\u2019 \n(Douse,2005:1). \n \nIntroduction \n \nDisaffection with school is global and can manifest itself in a number of ways \u2013 active \nand aggressive resistance within school, official exclusion resulting from resistance, \npassive resistance\/non-cooperation, mental truancy, actual truancy, temporary or \npermanent drop out (especially in countries where formal education is not universal); \nschool \u2018phobia\u2019 and the adoption of alternative modes of education such as home-\nbased education. Yoneyama (2000) provides a useful analysis of four explanatory \ndiscourses that inform the debate on \u2018Tokokyohi\u2019 or school phobia in Japan. Three out \n 2 \nof four - the psychiatric discourse (mental illness), the behavioural discourse (pupil \nlaziness) and the socio-medical discourse (pupil fatigue) - blame pupils and their \nparents  for not fitting into school. School is the default position, a given good. An \nexample of this approach was a report on school behaviour and disaffection by the \nEnglish Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) in 2005 which found that found \nthat schools faced  particular problems with children aged four to six  who are \u2018ill-\nprepared socially and emotionally\u2019 for school and that many disruptive pupils have \nspecial needs, poor language skills or come from disadvantaged or dysfunctional \nfamilies (Slater 2005).  \n \nThere is now such an emphasis on pupils and parents as the problem in certain \ncountries that the state is increasingly using the police and judicial systems to enforce \nschooling. In England parents are sent to prison if a child plays truant, police patrols \nsearch for school refusers and head teachers propose to fine parents up to \u00a3100 for \ntaking their children away on holiday in term time without permission. There are \nserious discussions about, and even trial runs of, the use of electronic tagging devices \nto cut down truancy in America, Japan and Britain (Lee 2005). In America there is a \ngrowing trend of criminalization of student misbehaviour. School discipline cases \nconcerning matters such as violations of the school dress codes and being loud and \ndisruptive in school are increasingly being sent to the courts and the juvenile justice \nsystem rather than being handled by the principal\u2019s office. One girl who refused to \nabide by the dress code was handcuffed by a city police officer and taken into a police \ncar a to a detention centre. In Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky and Florida juvenile court \njudges are complaining that their courtrooms are at risk of being overwhelmed by \nstudent misconduct cases that should be handled in schools. One juvenile court judge \n 3 \ntalked of the \u2018demonising of children\u2019 (Rimer 2004). A head teacher in South \nCarolina resigned amid public pressure after agreeing to a commando-style police raid \nin which officers stormed classes, guns drawn, handcuffing and pinning students to \nthe floor in a futile drugs search (Phillips 2006).  \n \nHowever, Yoneyama\u2019s fourth discourse, the citizens\u2019 discourse regards school phobia \nand other forms of school refusal as the normal response of normal students \u2013 it is the \nschools that are sick, students are not sick.  It is less a case of drop out than push out. \nThis article is concerned with this fourth discourse \u2013 the role that school plays \ninternationally in perpetrating disaffection with itself. The purpose of this article is to \nprovide some examples of the ways in which schooling is an unattractive and  hostile \nenvironment for learning that discourages both attendance and positive participation.  \n  \nThe Downside of Schooling \n \nMuch of the time an observer of global debates on education would be hard put to \nnotice that there was a serious problem with schooling. Conferences and publications \non education, whether of policy makers or academics, overwhelmingly stress issues of \naccess to schooling and the potential benefits of formal education such as higher \npersonal income, economic growth for the wider society, physical well being and \ngood citizenship and ignore, or at least play down, its more negative aspects. Yet \nthere is considerable evidence, for example, that schooling, rather than providing \nequality of opportunity and rewarding merit, actually reproduces existing inequalities \nin societies. This was argued in some detail by regard to America by Bowles and \nGintis (1976) but two recent large scale studies carried out by Bristol University and \n 4 \nKings College London produced very strong evidence of the continuing significance \nof social class background in influencing the educational chances of success of pupils \nin Britain. Children from middle class backgrounds have access to higher quality \neducational resources and better prospects of academic achievement than children \nfrom poorer backgrounds (Asthana and Hinscliff 2006; Taylor 2006). The British \npolitical elite also continues to be dominated by the products of private schools. \nWhereas 7% of the general population goes to private school, 76% of judges comes \nfrom private schools, 68% of barristers, 55% of solicitors, 32% of members of \nparliament, 42% of party leaders, 56% of life peers in the House of Lords, 56% of top \nnewspaper journalists and 56% of top TV journalists (Garner and Russell 2006). In \nAfrica political elites also utilise expensive private schools to help retain the \nprivileged positions of their families (Boyle 1999).  \n \nWorse, however, than reproduction is that there is also widespread evidence that \nschooling can be directly harmful and actively makes society worse by perpetrating \nviolence (Davies 2003; Harber 2004). This latter role of schooling, which has a \nsignificant impact on disaffection and the various forms of school refusal, forms the \nfocus of the present discussion. \n \nIt is interesting that pupils have been involved in organised protests against schooling \nsince medieval times. In 1911 up to a million school pupils in Britain went on strike. \nIn other countries too \u2013 America, China and South Africa \u2013 there have been organised \nforms of resistance to schooling (Adams 1991). So, it is perhaps not surprising that, \nwhen asked, pupils have some significant criticisms to make of schooling. The \n 5 \nforeword to a study of the views of the views of 15,000 pupils on schooling in Britain \nmade some very pertinent points in the light of the findings that followed, \n \n\u2018How can we turn schools into places where children happily go and are able to learn? \nAnd what is education for anyway?\u2026\u201dRespect\u201d was the single word that occurred \nmost; it was what the children wanted but felt they didn\u2019t get . They were forced to do \nwork they weren\u2019t interested in, in buildings that were falling down around their ears. \nThey were expected to fit into a structure and a curriculum that seemed to have been \ncreated without the first reference to what they might enjoy, or respond to. Most of \nall, they were sick of not being listened to\u2019 (Gardiner,2003:ix-x). \n \nThis in itself goes a long way to explaining pupil disaffection and a recent survey of \nteachers  in England suggested they agreed with over half saying classroom behaviour \nand the problem of pupil disengagement would decrease without the prescriptive,  \nrigid and restrictive national curriculum (Brettingham 2006). There have been similar \nfindings from studies of pupil views on schooling from America (Cushman 2003), \nIreland (Devine 2003) and Greece and Spain (UNESCO,2003:5). Even the school \nbuildings themselves can contribute to disaffection. A recent online survey of over \n1100 pupils between the ages of 10 and 18 in the UK found that 62% didn\u2019t like their \nschool buildings with many claiming they wee old, dirty and boring. Many of the \nstudents felt that increasing safety concerns \u2013 especially the use of high fencing - \nmeant that the school was starting to look like a prison and that their freedom was \nbeing curtailed. As the authors of the report stated, \u2018\u2026the debate on how we ensure \nour children\u2019s safety in school without locking them away in quasi prisons is long \noverdue\u2019 (Hill 2006).Given that many pupils are forced and cajoled into school in the \n 6 \nfirst place, the more interesting question is not why there is disaffection and resistance \nbut why so many pupils remain polite and well mannered?  \n \nFewer studies have been done on pupil\u2019s views in developing countries but some \nacademic studies have noted the often rigid, boring, irrelevant and poor quality of the \nschooling on offer (Molteno et al 2000:2,71; Alexander 2000:9). One study of rural \nschools in South Africa did ask pupils about their schooling. It found that there were \nworse problems than boredom or irrelevance \u2013 not only was the teacher-centred still \nthe norm but pupils registered their dislike of the use of continuing use of corporal \npunishment and the sexual harassment and abuse of female students (Nelson Mandela \nFoundation 2005).  \n \nFinally, it has to noted that corruption can also play a part in excluding pupils from \nschool.  As a recent book on corruption in schools and universities put it, there is no \nlack of data illustrating the diverse forms that corruption can take in the education \nsector (Hallak and Poisson 2006). As the authors of this book also point out, \neducational corruption and malpractice undermines one of the main potentially \npositive purposes of education, the promotion of universal values including integrity, \ncitizenship and ethics. A report by Save the Children in Mongolia, for example, noted \nthat teachers had started hidden businesses forcing pupils to buy textbooks, handouts \nand charging illegal fees thus pricing out many from attending school. This is coupled \nwith widespread physical and emotional violence against children by teachers in \nschool, also a major disincentive to attend (Save the Children 2006).   \n  \n 7 \nSafe in School?  \n \nAn enormous effort is made worldwide to get children into school. Two major \ninternational inter-governmental conferences have been held \u2013 one in Jomtien, \nThailand in 1990 and one in Dakar, Senegal in 2000 \u2013 where solemn pledges have \nbeen made to achieve primary education for all children globally. In those countries \nwhich have already achieved this, a huge effort is expended to actually keep them \nthere. However, reluctance to attend may in many cases have more to do with self-\npreservation. School are not necessarily safe places.  \n \nSchool buildings themselves can indeed be unsafe with dangers ranging from \nunhygienic toilets on the one hand to buildings in danger of falling down and failure \nto protect from earthquakes and fires on the other (Harber,2004:46). In July 2004, for \nexample,  a fire engulfed a primary school in Kumbhakonam in southern India, killing \n78 children, some of whom had been left unsupervised. School buildings in the town \ndo not require clearance from the fire department and even when the firs safety \nregulations are mandatory they are rarely observed. There are no trade standards for \nwho can become an electrician and shoddy electrical equipment adds to the problem. \nAll 23 of the school\u2019s teachers were reported as having run away from the school \nbuilding as the fire spread, leaving the children behind. Some pupils who died were \ntrapped because teachers and not unlocked an iron-grille door on the narrow staircase \nof the school building. Krishna Kumar of Delhi University\u2019s department of education \nsaid, \n \n 8 \n\u2018It\u2019s chaotic. No norms and guidelines are followed anywhere in India when schools \nare established\u2026A large number of schools, both private and government-run, are \nhoused in very dangerous buildings, but issues such as fire safety are too sophisticated \nfor government officials to enforce\u2019 (Rahman 2004 a and b).  \n \nThe failure of schools to protect children from bullying is another significant \ndisincentive to attend. Bullying can take many forms \u2013 physical violence, threats, \nname-calling, sarcasm, spreading rumours, persistent teasing, exclusion from a group, \ntormenting, ridicule, humiliation and abusive comments. It has been known to be a \nserious problem in schools in many countries for many years but little seems to \nchange (Roland and Munthe 1989; Oshako 1997; Ruiz 1998). One study of 13 year \nolds in 27 countries found that the majority had been engaged in bullying at least \nsome of the time (WHO 2002:29-30). A survey of 2772 pupils in Britain in 2000 \nreported that more than half the respondents had experienced bullying but just under \nhalf said their school did not have an anti-bullying policy, despite being required to do \nso since 1999. Of those with a policy only about half said they thought it was \nworking. Commenting on the findings the authors note that during their research \nheads told them that if you make a big thing out of bullying, parents will think you \nhave a bullying problem in your school (Katz, Buchanan and Bream, \n2001:Ch.5).Research commissioned by the charity Beatbullying, also in Britain,  \nfound a strong link between bullying and truancy. Reasons given by interviewees for \ntruancy included \u2018the need to go some where safe where no one could hurt me\u2019, \u2018fear \nof my life\u2019 and \u2018because I felt worthless and hated\u2019. What is horribly ironic about the \ncase studies that form part of the research is the contradiction between government \n 9 \npolicy to try to force pupils into schools and what happens when they get there. The \nfollowing are two examples: \n \n1. Karen, for example, had to choose whether to go to school and face insults, \nkicks and punches or stay at home and risk her mother being sent to prison for \nfailing to ensure her attendance. Karen did not go back to school in September \nafter the summer holidays as she was too afraid. When her mother received a \nletter threatening court action she had to go back and was immediately bullied. \nThe girls who bullied her were given detentions but Karen was now too \nfrightened to go to school. Karen\u2019s mother was taken to court and given a \nwarning and a parental tutor for a year. She was told that if Karen took another \nday off school she would be back in court facing more punishment.  \n2. Liam suffered persistent verbal and physical bullying so he truanted every day \nfor two months. When his mother supported his actions she was accused of \nkeeping her son from school and threatened with prosecution. Liam\u2019s school \nreacted initially by refusing to believe he was being bullied, despite having not \nprevious history of truanting( Blindel 2006). \n \nThe failure of schools to protect young people from bullying also poses some difficult \nquestions about whether schools as presently constituted can ever be truly inclusive \nfor students with special educational needs who may be particularly vulnerable to \nbullying. An \u2018inclusive school\u2019 can only work if everybody is prepared to treat \neverybody else equally and fairly. After a lengthy article by a twelve year old autistic \nboy appeared in the British press describing how he had been bullied at school and \nself-excluded, the chief executive of the National Autistic Society commented the \n 10 \nfollowing week that 60% of children at the more able end of the autistic spectrum are \nbullied at school: \n \n\u2018A report published by the National Autistic Society last month showed that, in many \ncases, bullying has led children with autism to self-harm or even to become suicidal \u2013 \nsome as young as five and six years old\u2019 (Education Guardian 19\/12\/2006).  \n \nIn Japan there is considerable concern about the large number of pupils who are \ntaking their own lives because of bullying and two headteachers also committed \nsuicide because they had failed to stop their pupils being bullied and committing \nsuicide (Fitzgerald 2006; The Guardian 10\/11\/2006).   \n \nTeachers, too, can be guilty of bullying. Interviews carried out with 40 first year \nuniversity students in Russia found that teachers called pupils a wide range of \ninsulting words if they did not learn fast enough; used their classroom pointers as \ntools of punishment and intimidation; destroyed school, accessories if they did not \ncomply with school regulations; threw various objects at pupils and  physically \nattacked them by hitting their heads, pushing them or banging their heads against the \nblackboard (Zdravomyslova andGorshkova 2006).  \n \n \nGender, Violence and Disaffection  \n \nAs Duncan (2006) argues, a great deal of what passes as \u2018ordinary\u2019 bullying in British \nschools is actually underscored by a struggle for a desired sexual identity. Osler \n 11 \n(2006) further argues that whereas boys are more likely to be involved in physical \nbullying, among girls verbal or psychological bullying is more common. Her research \nfound that schools tend to overlook verbal abuse, despite this being the most common \nform of bullying in schools and that this resulted in self-exclusion by girls when the \nnecessary social, emotional and behavioural support was not forthcoming. \n \nHowever, gender and sexuality are also significant factors in school refusal and drop \nout elsewhere. Various reasons have been given for the lower school attendance and \nhigher school dropout by females in developing countries including cultural resistance \nto female education, the wider family responsibilities of female children and the \ntendency to invest scarce family resources in the education of boys rather than girls. \nHowever, the school itself can also be an important factor. The problem has been \nneatly summarised in a recent book, \n \n\u2018Sexual aggression by male teachers and boys is often dismissed as \u201cjust boys being \nboys\u201d. Girls are blamed for \u201casking for it\u201d. The implicit messages are that males \nshould be tough, assertive, sexually predatory and ready for life in a rough-and-\ntumble world but females should be delicate, passive, sexually pure and sheltered. \nThese behaviours and messages often make schools un-safe and uncomfortable for \ngirls and are prominent among the reasons why, in many developing countries, \nadolescent girls are far less likely to attend than adolescent boys\u2019 (Leach and \nMitchell,2006:x).  \n \nWhile gender violence in schools is not a problem restricted to sub-Saharan that \nregion, as Leach and Mitchell note  (pp26-28), studies have been carried out in at least \n 12 \neight countries in that region which have revealed a consistent pattern of sexual abuse \nand harassment of girls by male students and teachers. Some teachers abused their \nauthority to demand sexual favours from girls in exchange for good grades, \npreferential treatment in class or money. Such teachers are rarely expelled from the \nteaching profession, at most being transferred to another school.  Similar sexual \nharassment of female students by tutors was found in a study of teacher education in \nGhana (Teni-Atinga 2006).  \n \nA study of 300 school girls in Pakistan (Brohi and Ajaib 2006) found that sexual \nharassment (comments, lewd suggestions, inappropriate physical contact) was \nregularly experienced at secondary level from both pupils and teachers. As the study \nnoted, while the girls were uncomfortable with their experiences, they were protective \nof their schools, offering excuses for the transgressions of others because they feared \nthat their families might remove them from school if they knew more about what \nhappened, a very real possibility according to the authors.   \n \nSometimes the sexual harassment becomes even more serious. While estimates for \nhow often a woman is raped in South Africa vary from every 26 seconds to every 90 \nseconds, a Medical Research Council survey carried out in South Africa in 1998 \nfound that among rape victims who specified their relationship to the perpetrator \n37.7% said their schoolteacher or principal had raped them (Human Rights \nWatch,2001:42).  \n \nSexual harassment and abuse of pupils is not confined to developing countries. Harber \n(2004:98-99), for example, cites cases from Ireland, Britain, Japan, Canada and \n 13 \nTurkey. In March 2005 The Observer newspaper published an article on the sexual \nabuse of children at a school for the deaf in the 1960\u2019s and the paper claimed that it \nwas aware of other allegations against deaf schools, both in the past and today \n(20\/3\/2005).  \n \nHomophobic bullying is also a serious problem in schools. A survey of 877 13-15 \nyear olds and their teachers in Britain found that two thirds of the young people and \nthree quarters of the teachers said they had seen homophobic bullying but only 13% \nof the pupils knew of rules or policies to prevent or punish it. While a quarter of the \npupils had been homophobically bullied, only 20% had reported it to a teacher. The \nthen schools minister, Stephen Twigg, launched an anti-bullying week when he \ndiscovered that only 6% of schools had policies and procedures to deal with \nhomophobic bullying of pupils or teachers (Richardson 2004). Meyer (2006) provides \nevidence of widespread homophobic bullying in America and a lack of intervention \nfrom educationalists to stop it with the result that \u2018\u2026this teaches students that schools \nas institutions  and their home communities, condone it\u2019 (p.44). She argues that \nAmerican schools generally place higher value on strength, competitiveness \naggressiveness and being tough \u2013 qualities widely seen as masculine. On the other \nhand, being creative, caring, good at school and quiet are often considered feminine \nqualities and are viewed by many as signs of weakness \u2013 particularly in boys, thereby \nleaving them open to homophobic bullying.  \n \nOther Exclusionary Practices \n \n 14 \nA form of violence institutionally sanctioned in many schools around the world is \ncorporal punishment. The World Health Organisation reports that corporal \npunishment remains legal in at least 65 countries, despite the fact that the United \nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child has underlined that corporal \npunishment is incompatible with the convention (WHO 2002). In other countries \nwhere it has been officially banned, such as South Africa, it is still widely used \n(Nelson Mandela Foundation 2005), suggesting that corporal punishment in school \nstill exists in at least one third and perhaps as much as half of the countries of the \nworld. This rarely makes pupils feel enthusiastic about schooling. When Ross Epp \nasked her American higher education students about how they recalled feeling about \nphysical punishment at school they reported feeling fear, humiliation, embarrassment \nand a sense of exclusion (1996:14-15). In Mexico, Martin (1994) reports that between \na quarter and a fifth of the pupils he interviewed said that corporal punishment \ncontributed to pupil drop out. In Nepal corporal punishment is an important reason for \nschool drop out  (Teeka-Bhattarai 2006) while in Botswana, \n \n\u2018The more obvious effects of corporal punishment included increased student anxiety, \nfear or resentment in class. Girls, in particular, remained silent, and were mistakenly \ndubbed as \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cshy\u201d by some teachers, and so did some boys. Other boys \nabsconded or refused to cooperate in female teachers\u2019 classes\u2026Other studies have \nalso found that excessive physical punishment, generally of boys, can prompt truancy\u2019 \n(Humphreys 2006).    \n \nThere is also widespread international evidence from a range of countries that \nintensely competitive examination regimes lead to high levels of stress and anxiety \n 15 \nlevels amongst schoolchildren. The resulting illnesses and absences are another form \nof state-sponsored school push-out, in some cultures permanent push-out as it is a \nsignificant contributory factor in suicides among young people (Harber 2004:Ch. 8). \nIn Britain, for example, a survey by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty \nto Children found that a third of 11-16 year olds are in a state of constant anxiety with \nconcerns about exams and homework at the top of the list of children\u2019s worries. The \nreport stated that \u2018In every classroom there are likely to be up to four children who \nhate leaving the house in the morning because of problems at school\u2019 (Slater \n2004).Others get through the day using anti-depressant drugs like Prozac and Seroxat. \nIn 1995 46,000 such drugs were prescribed to 16-18 year olds but by 2003 this had \nrisen to 140,000. David Cotterill, Professor of Child and Mental Health at Leeds \nUniversity argued that that there was a connection between this and the increased \nexamination pressure in the education system (Townsend 2004).     \n \nOsler (2006) makes a further connection between examinations and exclusion in \nEngland arguing that with schools under pressure to demonstrate improved  \nperformance in attainment tests and examinations, the numbers of disciplinary \nexclusions from schools (most commonly of  boys) started to increase steadily from \n2001. However, if girls were unhappy at school or faced difficulties they were more \nlikely to withdraw from learning or not attend rather than disrupt the learning of \nothers and so could be ignored \u2018\u2026particularly if the girls concerned drop out of \nschool altogether and are not counted in the school\u2019s examination performance\u2019 \n(p.575).  \n \n 16 \nOne further form of exclusion concerns prejudice or racism against a particular group. \nViolence against lower caste people or Dalits in India, for example, is widespread \n(Human Rights Watch 1999). Schooling, however, not only exacerbates prejudice \nagainst lower caste people, it also acts in a directly violent way towards them. A \nnational report in 2002 found that many lower caste children are regularly beaten at \nschool by teachers who regard them as polluting the class. The caste definition of \n\u2018untouchable\u2019 was abolished in 1950 but the country\u2019s 200 million Dalits \u2013 now \nreferred to as \u201cscheduled castes\u201d or \u201cscheduled tribes\u201d still routinely suffer \ndiscrimination. The India Education Report compiled by the National Institute of \nEducational Planning and Administration noted that lower caste pupils were verbally \nand physically abused. Teachers in schools often refused to touch them and made \nthem targets of their anger and abuse. They were punished at the slightest pretext and \noften humiliated. They were made to sit and eat separately. Their exercise books or \nwriting slates were not touched by the higher caste teachers. They were made to sit on \ntheir own mats outside the classroom or at the door. In many cases they are beaten up \nby children from the higher castes. Many lower caste children are not allowed to walk \nthrough the village on their way to school and are denied their right to free textbooks, \nuniforms and a midday meal. In rural Karnataka children from the lower castes are \nreferred to as \u201ckadu-jana\u201d (forest people) by teachers who claim that they would not \nlearn anything unless they were given a severe beating (Behal 2002). Recently Padma \nYedla, head of Save the Children\u2019s education programme in Orissa and Andra \nPradesh, said there remained ingrained prejudices against lower caste children in \nIndian state schools, \n \n 17 \n\u2018Instead of finding out why a child hasn\u2019t completed their homework, or recognising \nthat they cannot get help from an illiterate parent, the teachers resort to verbal abuse \nand humiliation. It\u2019s a vicious circle that only gets a bad response from the child\u2019 \n(Bancroft 2006).  \n \nA Fundamental Problem with Schools?  \nSo, what is it about the nature of schooling that not only cannot protect young people \nfrom violence and danger but actively perpetrates it? In terms of schooling, the \noverwhelming evidence is that the dominant or hegemonic model globally, with some \nexceptions, is authoritarian rather than democratic (Harber,2004:Ch.2). Education for \nand in democracy, human rights and critical awareness is not a primary characteristic \nof the majority of schooling. While the degree of harshness and despotism within \nauthoritarian schools varies from context to context and from institution to institution, \nin the majority of schools power over what is taught and learned, how it is taught and \nlearned, where it is taught and learned, when it is taught and learned and what the \ngeneral learning environment is like is not in the hands of pupils.  It is predominantly \ngovernment officials, headteachers and teachers who decide, not learners. Most \nschools are essentially authoritarian institutions, however benevolent or benign that \nauthoritarianism is and whatever beneficial aspects of learning are imparted.   \nWhy are the key international formal institutions of learning socially constructed in \nthis way? Historically, two of the main original purposes of mass formal schooling \nwas control and compliance and these purposes are both deeply embedded in the \nnature of contemporary schooling and are highly impervious to change. Green\u2019s study \nof the origins of formal schooling systems in England, France, the United States and \nPrussia in the nineteenth century argues that a key purpose of their construction, \n 18 \n \n\u2018\u2026to generalise new habits of routine and rational calculation, to encourage patriotic \nvalues, to inculcate moral disciplines and, above all, to indoctrinate in the political \nand economic creeds of the dominant classes. It helped construct the very \nsubjectivities of citizenship, justifying the ways of the state to the people and the \nduties of the people to the state. It sought to create each person as a universal subject \nbut it did so differentially according to class and gender. It formed the responsible \ncitizen, the diligent worker, the willing tax payer, the reliable juror, the conscientious \nparent, the dutiful wife, the patriotic soldier and the dependable or deferential voter\u2019 \n(1990:80). \n \nSchooling thus provided a means of social and political control, in particular to \ncounter the threat to the state of increasingly industrialised, urbanised and potentially \norganised working populations. As Green\u2019s study argues, \u2018The task of public \nschooling was not so much to develop new skills for the industrial sector as to \ninculcate habits of conformity, discipline and morality that would counter the \nwidespread problems of social disorder\u2019 (1990:59). Schooling would be organised to \nprepare future workers with the subordinate values and behaviours necessary for the \nmodern bureaucratic, mass production workplace and the existing social order \u2013 \nregularity, routine, monotonous work and strict discipline. Its organisational form \nwould therefore need to be authoritarian in order to inculcate habits of obedience and \nconformity. This authoritarian model of schooling with its origins in state formation, \nmodernisation and social and political control gradually extended globally from \nEuropean societies and Japan through colonisation where the key purpose of \n 19 \nschooling was to help to control indigenous populations for the benefit of the colonial \npower. \n \nAlthough physical appearances might sometimes suggest otherwise, in terms of power \nand control the majority of schools have basically remained much the same since their \ninception and gradually global spread from the end of the nineteenth century. In this \nauthoritarian situation of relative powerlessness and neglect of their human rights \npupils can be mistreated violently or be influenced by potentially violent beliefs \nbecause the dominant norms and behaviours of the wider society are shared,  or at \nleast tolerated, and not challenged, by many adults in the formal education system. In \nthis situation disaffection and resulting behaviours can become a rational and logical \nreaction.  \n \nConclusion \nWhile many pupils are happy at school, disaffection and non-attendance are also not \nat all uncommon. This paper has argued that one significant reason for this is the \nexperience of schooling, which for many pupils can be distinctly negative and even \ndangerous. School is very far from automatically being a good thing either for \nindividuals or societies and governments internationally would do well to examine \nwhat it is about the nature and practices of schooling that alienates so many pupils. \nWhile in the longer term the need is to move schools towards meeting the \nrequirements of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (greater \ndemocracy, more transparency, greater flexibility) in the short term there is still \nconsiderable effort required simply to stop schools and educational systems doing \nharm.      \n 20 \n \nReferences \n \nAdams,R.
