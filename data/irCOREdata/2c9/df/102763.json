Adaptive \nFrequency Hoping \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nRecently, MC-CDMA (Multi-Carrier Code Division \nMultiple Access) has attracted significant interest as a multiple \naccess method and has emerged as a potential candidate for 4G \ncellular systems [1]. This is mainly due to its capability of \nsimultaneously exploiting the advantages of OFDM \n(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and CDMA \n(Code Division Multiple Access) to eliminate ISI (Inter \nSymbol Interference) caused by frequency selective fading, and \nto cope with narrowband interference. Thereby ensuring very \nhigh data rates required for 4G systems.  \nIn the absence of CSI (Channel State Information) at \ntransmitter, MC-CDMA relies on fixed FEC (Forward Error \nCorrection) coding, bit interleaving [2] and frequency hopping  \n[3] across the sub-carriers to exploit time and frequency \ndiversity. However, if CSI is known at transmitter; the \navailable frequency diversity can be exploited to its full extent \n                                                        \n1 Number of total available sub-carriers \n \nby adapting the link level transmission parameters like sub-\ncarrier power, bit loading and sub-carrier frequency. This area \nof link adaptation has been exhaustively studied for simple \nmulti-carrier systems like OFDM [4;5]. Though few realizably \noptimal solutions have also been proposed for MC-DS-CDMA \n[6;7] but MC-CDMA is largely without any comprehensive \npower allocation solution so far. In some of reported work  \n[8;9] for MC-CDMA, authors have tried to exploit the Code \nDivision Multiple Access nature of the system and (ignoring \nMAI issue) have suggested Carrier Based (i.e Chip Based) \nwater filling type of power allocation schemes which are \noptimal for single user OFDM systems. In [10], although, \nauthors have considered effect of MAI while formulating the \nproblem, but then they have oversimplified problem by \nassuming that number of active users is much less than number \nof sub-carriers hence, have ignored MAI.  \nIn MC-CDMA system multiple access is accomplished \nthrough spreading in frequency domain in an effort to absorb \nthe frequency diversity to a greater extent. However, in multi-\nuser scenario, its performance is greatly hampered by MAI \ncaused by the frequency selectivity of the channel [11]. \nTherefore, Carrier Based power allocation schemes [8-10] \nderived by ignoring MAI, serves as an additional source of loss \nin multi-user orthogonality and deteriorates the BER \nperformance to unacceptable levels. Hence all such schemes \nare applicable only to partially loaded systems. This is exactly \ndue to this reason that optimal power solution derived \n(assuming MAI=0) by [10] is outperformed by a much simpler \nequal power allocation  in higher SNR region where MAI \ninterference dominates BER performance. \n Keeping in view this underlying problem associated with \npower and sub-carrier allocation in MC-CDMA systems, we \npropose a novel Band Based Dynamic Link Adaptation scheme \nthat  not only adapts power along frequency but also preserve \northogonality among users by spreading the signal only over a \nband of adjacent sub-carriers (N) lying within coherence \nbandwidth (Bc) of the channel. Since, N < NSC (total available \nsub-carriers), therefore rest of the bandwidth is used to \nadaptively hop the signal along frequency in accordance with \nCSI. A complete framework for BBDLA is developed in this \npaper. Computational complexity associated with Optimum \nBand Allocation (OBA) for BBDLA is examined. Then \nStochastically Fair Band Allocation (SFBA) is introduced as an \nheuristic approach to reduce the complexity and to ensure long \nterm fairness among users.

BER performance of BBDLA with suitably chosen N, \nis compared against other published schemes for power and \nsub-carrier allocation in MC-CDMA. The remainder of this \npaper is organized as follows.  In section II, a system model is \ndescribed for conventional non-adaptive MC-CDMA which is \nmodified in Section III as proposed by BBDLA. Simulation \nresults are discussed in section IV. Paper concludes with a \nsummary in section V. \nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nSingle cell MC-CDMA downlink is considered with \nsimultaneously J active users. Perfect CSI from all users is \nassumed to be perfectly known to Base Station (BS) either, by \nan error free feedback channel (FDD mode) or, through \nreciprocity of channel (TDD mode). User\u2019s data rates are \nassumed equal and fixed with unit transmitter powers.  \nA. Transmitter Architecture \nThe generic MC-CDMA transmitter for jth user is shown in \nFigure 1.  The input information stream aj (with bit duration Tb)\nis converted into P parallel data sequences [aj,0 (i), aj,1 (i),\u2026\u2026 \naj,P(i)]. Thereby increasing symbol duration to Ts = PTb.\nSubsequently, each of these sequences is spread over frequency \ndomain using normalized Hadamard spreading codes dj,m with \nlength KMC. This spread data is used to modulate Nsc = PKMC\nsub-carriers through Nsc point IDFT. Finally, cyclic prefix \n(CP) is used in guard interval Tg after each OFDM symbol to \novercome inter carrier interference.

BAND BASED DYNAMIC LINK ADAPTATION\nBBDLA scheme divides whole of the available \ntransmission bandwidth \u2206 f\u2019\u00d7 NSC  into K smaller bands with N \nsub-carriers in each band such that 1 \u2264 N \u2264 KMC . Now, if N is \nchosen such that N\u00d7\u2206 f\u2019 << Bc, then N orthogonal users at the \nmaximum may share each of these bands without undergoing \nany loss in their orthogonality due to frequency selective nature \nof the channel. Furthermore, since, N < NSC, therefore rest of \nthe bandwidth is used to adaptively hop the signal along \nfrequency in accordance with CSI.  \nThis new proposed scheme is actually a hybrid of \u201cK\u201d \nFDMA bands each one shared by N users in MC-CDMA \nfashion as shown in Figure 3.  This reduction in spreading \nfactor not only overcomes the MAI problem associated with \nmulti-user MC-CDMA; but also provides an opportunity to \njointly avail the benefits of the frequency diversity as well as \nmulti-user diversity to its full extent by adaptively (with CSI) \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

It must be noted that total transmission power \n(assumed unity in our model) is equally divided among \nselected Bands. Although, this power could have been adapted \nin an optimal fashion however, we have made no such attempt \nfollowing the findings of [13], which suggests that with \nsuitable allocation of Bands, even Equal Power Allocation \nperforms extremely close to Water-filling solution. \nT\nh\nFigure 3. Adaptive MC-CDMA using BBDLA with  CSI updation time \nperiod of Th. Colours represent users with orthogonal codes. Total number of \nsub-carriers = Nsc, Sub-carrier per MC-CDMA band = N and K = Nsc\/N \nA. Optimum Band Allocation \nSince, P bands are required for each user in order to meet \nits data rate requirements and only N out of J active user can be \naccommodated on each of the K bands. Therefore, optimum \nband allocation (where each user is allocated its favorite sub-\ncarriers) becomes a version of well known set portioning \nproblem. Let A = { A1, A2, \u2026\u2026A J }be any partition of the set \nof all available bands B ={1,2, \u2026\u2026.K} into J subsets such \nthat        cardinality of Aj = P and no k\u2208 B belongs to more \nthan N number of sub-sets of A. Since, the sub-sets of A are not \ndisjoint, therefore, this problem is very complex and \ncomputationally extensive to solve. It has been shown in [14] \nthat size of solution space for such a problem with J users, \nNsc=128 and N=16 is  \n20sc 10\nN\nJ >\u00b8\u00b8\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\u00a8\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\u00d7\nN\nTherefore, a heuristic approach is taken to solve this \nproblem and Stochastically Fair Band Allocation (SFBA) \nscheme is proposed that guarantees long term fairness among \nusers.  \nB. Stochastically Fair Band Allocation \nSFBA, at every updation period randomly selects users and \nlet them choose their favorite bands among the available bands \nsubject to (11) and (12). Complete algorithm is given below: \ni. Initialize Sj,k  = 0, nk=0; \u2200j,k  \nii. Define power threshold Pth = [0,1] \niii. Define set of active users Q = {0,1 \u2026\u2026.. J-1} \niv.

SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS\nSimulation parameters are shown below in Table I which have \nbeen adopted from MATRICE 2  (MC-CDMA Transmission \nTechniques for Integrated Broadband Cellular Systems)\nspecifications. First of all, in order to study the effect of \ncoherence bandwidth of channel on the choice of N we have \nstudied the BER performance in presence of BBDLA as \nfunction of band size N for different channel types (TABLE II.  \n). As shown in Figure 4. a sharp decline in system performance \ncan be observed when value of N is increased beyond Nth which \nitself decrease with decrease in channel Bc. This observation \nreinforces our hypothesis: \u201creduction in spreading factor such \n                                                       \n2 European-IST project could be accessed at http:\/\/www.ist-\nmatrice.org\/ \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Interestingly the optimum (which \nminimizes BER in given scenario) value of N is found to be 1 \nfor all channel realization. This observation promotes OFDMA \nas better candidate rather than MC-CDMA as along as CSI is \nknown at transmitter. However, spread spectrum nature of MC-\nCDMA will be advantageous to suppress Other Cell \nInterference (in multi-cell scenario) and narrow band \ninterference especially in highly loaded system where freedom \nto maneuver around such jammed sub-carriers will be less. \nTherefore, we can safely opt for a MC-CDMA with reduced \nspreading factor Nth which gives a BER performance very \nclose to OFDMA and don\u2019t completely strip off the system \nrobustness against any possible interference.  \nTABLE I.

BER as function of system \nload is chosen as performance metric. It can be seen that \ninterleaving improves system performance as compared to a \nconventional MC-CDMA system but only at lower system \nloads where diversity gain exploited by interleaving is more as \ncompared to the additional MAI caused. However reverse is \ntrue for higher system loads. Similarly, CBDPCS outperforms \nthe non-adaptive MC-CDMA at low system loads and its \nperformance deteriorates sharply with system load which can \nbe attributed to MAI enhancement by carrier based power \nallocation. However, in case of BBDLA the system load has \nalmost negligible effect on performance until an appreciable \nsystem loading of 62% (users 20) beyond which BBDLA \nperformance decreases slowly due to decreased available \nfrequency adaptivity.  However, even at full system load the \nBER performance stays at a reasonable value of 4x10-4 at \nEb\/No = 12dB for maximum Doppler shift of  Fd=33.36Hz that \ncorresponds to a typical mobile user at speed of 7.2 Km\/h. \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n10\n-6\n10\n-5\n10-4\n10-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\n10\n0\nBE\nR \n(A\nv\ner\nag\ned\n \n)\nUsers\nnon-adaptive\nCBDPCA\nnon-adap. with FI\nBBDLA\nFigure 5.

CONCLUSION\nWe have shown that Carrier Based dynamic carrier and \npower allocation techniques, which substantially improve the \nperformance in MAI free systems (like OFDMA) or where \nMAI is not caused by frequency selectivity of channel (like \nMC-DS-CDMA), can\u2019t be generalized to MC-CDMA (where \nMAI is strongly related to frequency selectivity of channel). \nTherefore, we have proposed BBDLA scheme for MC-CDMA, \nwhich not only allocate suitable bands to different users but \nalso preserves orthogonality among users and hence keeps \nMAI to its statistical minimum. Although, with transmit power \nequally distributed among selected bands, BBDLA is shown to \noutperform the existing carrier based dynamic carrier allocation \nschemes derived ignoring the MAI enhancements caused by \npower allocation. This scheme approximately maintains a \nsingle user performance even at a system load of 62% beyond \nwhich its BER performance undergoes graceful degradation \nbut even then stays at a reasonably acceptable value of 4\u00d710-4\nat Eb\/No = 12dB in a typical outdoor mobile channel for a \ntypical mobile user.\nVI.
