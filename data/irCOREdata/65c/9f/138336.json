Introduction\nBiological nutrient removal (BNR) is widely used in modern municipal and industrial\nwastewater treatment plants. A significant factor in the success of the BNR process is the\navailability of a suitable carbon source. Many authors have reported a specific ratio of\ncarbon to phosphorus (P) and carbon to nitrogen (N), which can indicate the suitability of\nthe wastewater for BNR treatment (Johnsson et al., 1996; Randall et al., 1992; Grady et\nal., 1999 and Curto 2001). The most common methods for increasing these ratios and\nhence make the wastewater treatable by a BNR process, are the pre-treatment of the\nwastewater (McCue et al., 2003) or the addition of extra carbon. The extra carbon can\neither be organic carbon in the form of methanol, ethanol, acetic acid and glucose,\nhydrolysed primary and secondary sludge or industrial wastes rich in readily\nbiodegradable organic matter and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (Charlton 1994 and Llabres\net al., 1999).\nThe online fermentation of wastewater is able to increase the concentration of VFAs (by\n25 %) and improve the performance of the process (McCue et al., 2003). Likewise sludge\nfermentation can increase the available carbon and improve nutrient removal\n(Hatziconstantinou et al., 1996 and Charlton 1994). Unfortunately, the application of\nthese methods is not a straightforward procedure, since site enlargement is required and\nusually the fermenters are prepared for permanent use without being flexible to any\nmodifications (flows, retention times etc.) (Munch and Koch, 1999). In addition, nutrients\nare also released from sludge during the fermentation process, increasing the overall\namount of nutrients that have to be removed. Industrial wastes, such as the fermented\norganic fraction of municipal solid waste, fermented leachate of food waste and nightsoil\nhave been shown to contain rich organic substrate in terms of VFA and soluble chemical\n3oxygen demand (SCOD) (Llabres et al., 1999; Bolzonella et al., 2001 and Choi et al.,\n1996). The addition of the above wastes in BNR process has been reported to have a\npositive impact increasing the removal of nitrogen (~ 28-109 % increase) and phosphorus\n(~ 97-410 % increase) (Lim et al., 2000 and Lee et al., 1997). For instance, in the UK the\nwastewater treatment plants in Derby and Reading in Severn Trent Water and Thames\nWater areas, respectively, are successful BNR sites with domestic sewage being mixed\nwith industrial effluent. When the additional carbon is in the form of methanol or acetic\nacid, there is an improvement in BNR performances (Tam et al., 1992; and Fass et al.,\n1994). The only and important disadvantage of the addition of direct organic carbon is the\nhigh operational cost. Similarly, the industrial wastes are not always applicable to a given\nwastewater treatment plant since transportation requirements may result in extra costs.\nMoreover, the content of nutrients in some industrial wastes is high, increasing the load to\nthe process.\nResearchers investigating alternative carbon sources, which can easily be used without\nhigh operational cost, observed that sludge disintegration used in sludge treatment\nprocesses is able to increase the SCOD and VFA content. The ultimate goals of these\nmethods are foam control, increase in biogas production and sludge mass reduction\n(Muller 2000b). However, there is little information about the application of the\ndisintegrated sludge to BNR in order to improve P and N removal. Muller (2000a and\n2000b), made a comparison of mechanical, thermal and chemical sludge treatment. The\nhighest degree of disintegration was reached by the chemical (ozone) treatment (52%)\nwith the mechanical methods reaching medium degrees of disintegration (20-37%) with a\nrelatively low energy input (1000-10000 kJ kg-1). Stirred ball mills and high pressure\nhomogenizers were used for sludge disintegration by Muller (2000), to produce a carbon\n4source for denitrification. According to their experiments the maximum denitrification\nrate was up to 15 mg NO3-N g-1 VSS h-1. Chiu et al., (1997) reported that the\ncombination of alkaline treatment with ultrasound vibration brought an increase in SCOD\nand VFA at 41.5 and 28 times, respectively. The maximum increase in SCOD was\nreported by Wang et al., (1999) at 50 times with ultrasound equipment of 400 W treating\n100 ml of surplus activated sludge (SAS) for 40 minutes.\nThis study examines mechanical sludge disintegration using a deflaker, a technology\ndesigned for processing the pulp in paper industries. The main goal of this study was to\nexamine whether this equipment is capable of producing extra carbon from SAS and to\ninvestigate the mechanisms of disintegration. The suitability of the carbon produced for\nimproving biological nutrient removal will be investigated in further research.\n2. Material and methods\nThe SAS used in this study was collected immediately after the belt thickener with the\ntotal solid (TS) concentration in the range of 4-7 %, from wastewater treatment plants\n(WWTPs) that operate in BNR (BNR SAS) or standard activated sludge mode (non BNR\nSAS) (Table 1).\n2.1 Disintegration\nThe equipment used for sludge disintegration was a 10\u201d Pilao DTD Spider Deflaker with\na 30 kW motor fitted with 230 mm discs with 3 active cell layers (Figure 1). The gap\ndistance between stator and rotor was 0.6-0.9 mm and the rotation speed 3000-3600 rpm,\n(Withey 2003). The disintegration process was conducted as a batch with five litres of\nthickened SAS to be treated each time at four different retention times, 2, 5, 10 and 15\n5minutes. The maximum monitored temperature of disintegrated sludge was 35 oC and\nconsidered to have negligible effect on disintegration (Wang et al., 2005). To quantify\nmaximum carbon release in SAS a thermal extraction method was established, which was\na modification of a method reported by Zhang et al., (1999) for the extraction of\nextracellular polymers. This method was used only for comparative reasons as was\nassumed that thermal extraction could indicate the absolute carbon release causing cell\nlysis. During that method thickened SAS was left for an hour under the conditions of 1bar\nand 105oC.\n2.2 Analytical methods\nParticle size analysis was carried out using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern, UK).\nThe Mastersizer uses an optical unit to detect the light scattering pattern of sludge\nparticles dispersed in deionised water. High performance size exclusion chromatography\n(HPSEC) was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\n(Shimadzu VP Series, Shimadzu, UK) with UV detection set at 254 nm and a BIOSEP-\nSEC-S300 column (Phenomenex, UK). For each sample a chromatogram of absorbance\nagainst time was produced. Larger molecular size compounds were eluted from the\ncolumn first and smaller molecules later.\nApart from the total solids all the other analysis were carried out in the filtered (0.45 \u03bcm)\nsupernatant of the untreated and treated sample after centrifugion (10500 g, 7oC). The\nconcentration of Total Solids (TS), soluble COD, VFA, NH4+ and P was measured\naccording to APHA Standard Methods (1998). The soluble protein content was\ndetermined according to standard protein method by Branford (1976) with a protein\ndiagnostic kit (Sigma, England). The concentration of soluble proteins was determined\nfrom a standard curve constructed using bovine serum albumin (P0914 Sigma \u2013 Aldrich,\n6Gillingham, UK) in deionised water, as the standard. Soluble carbohydrate concentrations\nwere determined using the phenol sulphuric method introduced by Dubois et al., (1956).\nCarbohydrate concentration was calculated from a calibration curve constructed using a\nglucose standard.\n3. Results-Discussion\nThe mechanical disintegration of thickened SAS by the deflaker was evaluated in terms of\nsoluble carbon release, and its correlation with energy input. In addition, the mechanism\nof the process was investigated in order to identify whether the deflaker is able to cause\nfloc disruption, floc breakage or cell lysis.\n3.1 Carbon and phosphorus release and energy input\nThe initial concentration of VFA and SCOD in thickened SAS was always dependant on\nthe WWTP source (BNR or non BNR). In BNR thickened SAS was ranged from 0 to 19\nmg l-1 and 120 to 342mg l-1 for VFA and SCOD, respectively and in non BNR from 186\nto 311 mg l-1 and 752 to 1180 mg l-1 for VFA and SCOD, respectively. The results from\nmechanical disintegration of BNR thickened SAS at four different retention times in the\ndeflaker are summarized in Table 2. As expected, the increase in VFA and SCOD was\nrelated to the disintegration time. The maximum concentration of VFA and SCOD\nmeasured were 530mg l-1 and 6180 mg l-1 for 10 and 15 minutes retention time,\nrespectively. Additionally, phosphorus release also occurred, again increasing with the\nretention time in the equipment with the maximum concentration measured to be 480 mg\nl-1 for 15 minutes of disintegration. The ammonium was not frequently measured and only\na few measurements have been taken in the disintegrated sludge by deflaker for 15\nminutes, which showed that there is an increase reaching the concentration of ~60 mg l-1.\n7The results from disintegration of non BNR SAS followed the same trend as the BNR\nsludge, although here the initial concentrations of VFA and SCOD were higher (Table 3).\nThis is expected as in the non BNR WWTP the soluble available carbon is not totally\nconsumed and can still be found in surplus sludge. Phosphorus release was much lower\nwith the maximum concentration to be 135 mg l-1, as in non BNR WWTP the biologically\nstored phosphorus content in sludge is lower than in sludge from BNR WWTP. The\nmaximum concentration of the released P was 135 mg l-1 for 15 minutes of disintegration,\nmuch lower than the respective concentration after disintegration of BNR sludge (480 mg\nl-1).\nThe energy consumption of the deflaker was 5.7 kW for each 5 L of sludge. After 15 min\nof disintegration at 1.14 W ml-1 the SCOD was increased by 20 times. This compares well\nto the increase in SCOD by 7.7 times reported by Mao et al., (2004) with a sonication of\n20 kHz frequency and at 4 W ml-1. The performance of disintegration by the deflaker can\nalso be compared with other disintegration techniques by using specific energy, which\ncan be defined as the amount of mechanical energy that stresses a certain amount of\nsludge (Muller 2000a). The effect of specific energy from the deflaker on SCOD shows as\nexpected, that greater energy input gave higher release in SCOD (Figure 2). The rate of\nSCOD release is higher for the first 2500 kJ kg -1 TS, than when more energy is applied.\nThis rate (specific energy <2500 kJ kg-1 TS) is the same for the two sludges with different\nsolids concentration, but with higher energy input the more thickened sludge proved to be\nmore efficient as with the same energy gives higher SCOD release. The degree of\ndisintegration for COD (DDCOD) was also taken into account, which was calculated by\nthe equation below:\n8DDCOD = [ (CODd \u2013 CODu) \/ (CODth \u2013 CODu) ] \u00b7 100 [%],\nWhere CODd, CODu, and CODth are the SCOD values for the disintegrated (CODd),\nuntreated (CODu) and thermal extracted (CODth) sample (Muller 2000a). The maximum\ndegree of disintegration was taken as being released by a thermal extraction method,\nwhich gives similar results with other methods used in literature for the same purpose\n(Lehne et al., 2001, Muller 2000b, Tiehm et al., 2001).\nThe degree of disintegration by the deflaker as a function of specific energy is shown\nbelow (Figure 3). Stirred ball mills (SBM), which are a similar type of mechanical\nequipment to the deflaker and an ultrasonic homogenizer (UH) were tested by Muller\n(2000a). A comparison of deflaker to the other equipment showed that to achieve a 25%\ndegree of disintegration SBM, deflaker and UH required 3000, 4000 and 10400 kJ kg-1\nTS of specific energy, respectively.\n3.2 Mechanisms of disintegration\nThe results from the particle size distribution from both sludges showed that the deflaker\nwas able to decrease the size of the particles (Figures 4 and 5). The median size of the raw\nBNR sludge was around 65.5 \u03bcm and was reduced to 9.3 \u03bcm after 15 minutes of\ndisintegration. Similarly, the size of particles in raw non BNR sludge was 45.6 \u03bcm and\nafter 10 minutes of disintegration with the deflaker was 9.3 \u03bcm. The formation model of\nfloc consists of primary particles (~2.5 \u03bcm), microflocs (~13 \u03bcm) and porous flocs (~100\n\u03bcm) (Jorand et al., 1995). Particle size distribution shows that after disintegration not only\nmost of the porous flocs are destroyed, but also some of the microflocs with the\nsimultaneous release of polymeric compounds which link the microflocs to each other\n9(Jorand et al., 1995). That is in agreement with Chu et al., (2001) who reported a porous\nfloc destruction at an ultrasonic treatment of 20 kHz frequency at 0.44 W ml-1 and can be\nconfirmed by the fact that the reduction in particle size takes place with the increase in\norganic matter (SCOD, VFA).\nAccording to Lehne et al., (2001) 3000 kJ kg-1 TS are required for floc size reduction and\ndecrease the median size of the particles down to 10-15 \u03bcm. They reported that further\ndisintegration caused a smaller decrease in particle size, from 10-15 \u03bcm to 3 \u03bcm with high\namount of specific energy (from 3000 to 100000 kJ kg-1 TS). Here the deflaker was able\nto cause porous floc disruption as the median particle size is decreased to approximately\n10 \u03bcm and for similar specific energies (~2500 kJ kg-1TS) (Figure 6). In addition, as\nmentioned above the SCOD release follows a different rate between the first 2500 kJ kg-1\nTS applied and the rest specific energy added. The release in SCOD is faster for the first\n2500 kJ kg-1 TS of specific energy and around 0.96 mg SCOD per kJ kg-1 TS of specific\nenergy added, when also particle size is significantly reduced and then the rate is\ndecreased to 0.36 mg SCOD per kJ kg-1 TS of specific energy added with almost no\nreduction in the particle size. That means that during the floc breakage, a big amount of\norganic matter is released in the liquid phase (1500-1900 mg l-1 in terms of SCOD) and\nfor further disintegration and energy input organic matter is also released, but without any\ndifference in particle size indicating that is not coming from the disruption or breakage of\nflocs.\nIt is still not certain though, whether cell lysis takes place as the released organic matter\nafter 2500 kJ kg-1 TS of specific energy could be not due to cell lysis, but due to further\nfloc breakage. The concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the\n10\nsupernatant before and after disintegration were also examined in order to evaluate\ndisintegration. Protein analysis has been reported as another method for assessing\ndisintegration showing that can be a relatively quick and effective method (Schmitz et al.,\n2000). The concentrations of proteins, carbohydrates, SCOD and VFA after disintegration\nwere related to the retention time (Figures 7 and 8). Here, disintegration was compared\nwith the thermal extraction method, as an estimation of maximum release. The\npredominant component of the released material is SCOD, which includes the proteins,\ncarbohydrates and volatile acids. The protein concentration indicates that a part of the\nextracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which link the microflocs to each other, have\nbeen destroyed (Jorand et al., 1995, Wang et al., 2005). The concentration of proteins\nincreased approximately 27 and 5 fold for BNR and non BNR sludge, respectively. This\nincrease is significantly higher than the one reported by Nah et al., (2000) from\nmechanical treatment using a high pressure pump and a nozzle (2.5 times), but lower than\nthe increase reported for ultrasound treatment (200 W and 9 kHz) for 40 minutes (~48\ntimes) (Wang et al., 1999). The results agree with Wang et al., (2005) who reported an\nincrease in SCOD, proteins, polysaccharide and DNA after disintegration by ultrasound\n(300-1200 W, 20 kHz and 0-30 minutes retention time).\nTo summarize, the particle size distribution showed that disintegration caused a decrease\nin particle size with the simultaneous release of organic matter in the form of proteins and\ncarbohydrates. The breakage of flocs released the polymeric substances used for the\nformation of flocs in the aqueous phase. But, to determine whether cell lysis takes place\nfurther information was required.\n11\nThe high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was used as a\n\u201cfingerprint\u201d technique for the organic materials that are produced during disintegration.\nThe results showed that during short retention time (<10 minutes) large molecular size\nmaterials (first peaks in the graph) are released, which are thought to be polymeric\nsubstances and typically found outside of the cells (extracellular) (Figure 9) (Jorand et al.,\n1995). At longer retention time (\u226510 minutes) the release not only of the extracellular, but\nalso of smaller molecular size materials (last peak in the graph) can be observed. These\nmaterials can either be disrupted extracellular polymers or intracellular material after cell\nlysis. On the other hand the thermal extraction method seems to have released small\nmolecular size materials without destroying the polymeric substances (Figure 9c). Taking\nalso into account that the destruction of polymers would not have caused an overall\nincrease of the soluble organic matter as was observed (Figures 7 and 8), we consider\nthat the appearance of smaller compounds in BNR SAS disintegration are mainly material\nthat have been released due to cell lysis. Moreover, after the destruction of the flocs and\nthe removal of the polymeric substances from the cell walls the shear forces from the\ndeflaker would be able to break the cell walls (Wang et al., 2005). Results from HPSEC\nconfirmed the data from particle size distribution proving that during mechanical\ndisintegration with the deflaker, firstly flocs are disrupted decreasing the particle size and\nreleasing extracellular material and then cell lysis starts taking place releasing some extra\norganic matter, for longer periods of disintegration (\u226510 minutes or \u22659000 kJ kg-1 TS of\nspecific energy).\nAfter the particle size distribution it was suspected that the increase in organic matter\nafter 2500 kJ kg-1 TS of specific energy added, with the simultaneous steady size of the\nparticles is due to cell lysis. The HPSEC results showed that cell lysis appears when more\n12\nenergy is added (9000 kJ kg-1 TS), proving that the extra SCOD released for energies\nbetween 2500 and 9000 kJ kg-1 TS is because of further breakage of the flocs. Using the\n9000 kJ kg-1 TS of specific energy as a threshold for cell lysis we can estimate the\nproportion of SCOD that comes from floc breakage and cell lysis (Figure 2). For a total\nenergy input of 14250 kJ kg-1 TS and 4900 mg l-1 of SCOD released the 73 % or 3900 mg\nl-1 SCOD comes from floc disruption or breakage and the remaining 27 % from cell lysis.\nThe above could be verified by confirming the threshold of cell lysis by doing an assay\nfor DNA, where the significant increase in the concentration means cell lysis.\nThe lack of available soluble carbon is a major problem in the BNR process. This study\nshows that the deflaker process can be used to disintegrate the sludge and release trapped\norganic material to the liquid phase. Unfortunately, there is little information in the\nliterature about the application of disintegrated sludge in BNR, as an extra carbon source.\nMost of the applications of sludge disintegration to date have consisted of improving\nanaerobic digestion and reducing sludge production. Muller (2000b) has reported some\nexemplary results of how denitrification rate can be improved by different disintegration\nmethods. As reported by the same author mechanical disintegration on adapted biomass\ngave a higher denitrification rate compared with thermal disintegration (no relation with\nthermal extraction method mentioned above) and biological hydrolysis.\nA comparison has been made between the available carbon produced and phosphorus\nreleased by disintegration in the form of SCOD to P ratio (Table 4). The ratios are low (7-\n13 for BNR sludge) compared to the ratios found in the literature for successful BNR\nplants (40-60) (Randall et al., 1992; Carlson et al., 1996), but with longer disintegration\ngiving higher ratio. That means that mechanical disintegration releases more phosphorus\n13\nthan the produced carbon is theoretically able to remove. The ratios for non BNR sludge\nare higher than the ones produced from BNR sludge (77 and 13.6 for non BNR and BNR\nsludge, respectively), but are expected to decrease, when the WWTP be converted to\nBNR and the phosphorus being removed biologically. This is an indication that the\naddition of mechanically disintegrated sludge in a BNR process can cause deterioration\ninstead of improvement. The sidestream removal of the released phosphorus (i.e. struvite\nor calcium phosphate precipitation) before being added to the process could make\ndisintegration by deflaker to have a positive impact on BNR. On the other hand, the\nincrease of ammonium was not significant enough to affect negatively the SCOD:NH4+\nand this ratio was increased (250 %) to ~70 which is much higher than the theoretical\nrequirements for nitrogen removal (8-14 for TCOD:TKN) (Carlson et al., 1996, Grady et\nal., 1999). Whether the extra soluble carbon produced by the deflaker can be utilised by\nthe bacteria and improve both denitrification and phosphorus removal needs to be\nexamined experimentally in further research.\n4. Conclusions\n\uf0b7 The examined disintegration technique, the deflaker proved to be able to increase\nthe soluble carbon in the form of VFA and SCOD.\n\uf0b7 The increase in concentration of VFA, SCOD, proteins and carbohydrates was\nrelated to the time of disintegration and the source of the sludge, with non BNR\nSAS resulting in higher values, with the maximum concentration of VFA and\nSCOD at 852 mg l-1 and 6530 mg l-1, respectively.\n\uf0b7 The increase in the concentration of phosphorus during the disintegration of BNR\nSAS reaching 480 mg l-1 for 15 minutes of retention time led to a relatively low\nratio of SCOD:P (~13), which indicated that the addition of disintegrated sludge\n14\nwould deteriorate the process. The sidestream stripping of phosphorus\nimmediately after the disintegration is considered essential in order to have an\nimprovement of BNR performances.\n\uf0b7 Particle size distribution showed that the deflaker decreased and destroyed the\nporous flocs and microflocs releasing the organic matter that links particles\ntogether.\n\uf0b7 High performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) confirmed that at\nshort disintegration time (2-10 minutes or 2000-8000 kJ kg-1 TS) the deflaker was\nable to release the extracellular material, while disintegration for longer period\n(\u226510 minutes or 9000 kJ kg-1 TS of specific energy) caused cell lysis. No cell lysis\nwas observed for the non BNR sludge.\n\uf0b7 The addition of 15000 kJ kg-1 TS of specific energy increased SCOD\nsignigicantly, from which 73 % probably came from floc disruption and breakage\nand the rest from cell lysis.\n\uf0b7 Further research will examine the application of disintegrated sludge on BNR, as\nextra carbon source. Firstly, lab scale tests will investigate the suitability of the\nreleased carbon on BNR enhancement and then tests on a pilot plant will examine\nthe conditions under which this internal carbon can be applied.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Severn Trent Water Ltd and Thames Water for\ntheir financial support.\n15\nReferences\nAPHA (1998).
