Introduction \n \nThe inability of airlines to distribute their products\u2019 cost effectively created the \ndemand for agency relationships in the first place.  However in recent years the \nrelationship between the parties has changed, firstly in the US, and latterly within \nEurope.  The causes of such a change were as follows: \n \n\u2022 Airlines\u2019 drive to reduce costs  \n\u2022 Airlines wishing to have more direct contact with their clients \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  2\n\u2022 Technology providing the possibility of a direct channel between airlines and \nits customers- both individual and corporate customers \n\u2022 Large corporates becoming more professional in the way they purchase travel \nproducts \n \nDistribution accounts for about 17% of airlines\u2019 total operating costs and ranks as the \nthird largest cost for an airline after labour (IATA, December 2000).  Commission \ncosts account for approximately 8% of the costs, while ticketing for 2-3%, CRS fees \nfor 2% and credit card fees for 2-3%.   It must be born in mind that in recent years \nairlines have been successful in reducing such costs as illustrated in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1: Ticketing, Sales and Distribution Costs \n \nAfter labour costs, distribution costs were the second largest cost item upon which \nairlines could exert some influence. As technological developments meant that travel \nagency costs were reduced, airlines started to question the agents\u2019 commission levels, \nand the value of their services.   At the same time they attempted to increase their \ndirect sale mainly through call centres and internet. \n \nAn increasing number of corporates developed travel policies to the extent that \naround 50% of business travellers are subject to some form of policy laid down by the \ncompany for whom they work (Mason 2001).  Such corporates seek reductions in \ntheir travel costs by striking direct deals with airlines. Corporate travel managers, \ntherefore, invite suppliers to tender for \u201cpreferred supplier\u201d status.  They appear to be \nlooking for efficiency, value, accurate data supply and comprehension of travel policy \nstructures. However they require business travel agents\u2019 expertise to monitor their \ntravel policy and provide them with management information.   \n \nWhile all the above have contributed towards the changes in the distribution model, it \nappears that it is the airlines\u2019 drive to reduce distribution costs through lowering \ncommission rates that has played the major part.  \n \nThe changes taking place in the airlines and travel agents relationship in all regions \nraise a number of questions which are as follows: \n \n\u2022 What is the current distribution model? \n\u2022 Have airlines been successful in by-passing travel agents? \n\u2022 Would airlines in Asia-Pacific follow the trends in US and in Europe? \n\u2022 Are there any barriers to prevent airlines in all regions to sell direct and by-\npass travel agents? \n\u2022 Do customers prefer to go direct to airlines to purchase their tickets? \n \nTo address the above questions first the airline distribution model in general is \ndiscussed, then a review of the developments in the US and Europe in relation to \nairline and travel agents relationship is provided.  To determine the airline and agent\u2019s \nrelationship in Asia Pacific a survey of key airlines in the area is carried out. \n \n \n2. Airline distribution model \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  3\n \nAirlines can utilise many channels to sell their tickets to the customers.  As shown \nbelow, they can sell directly through their sales offices; call centres; own website and \nto corporates.  The indirect channels which are opened to them are traditional travel \nagents; on-line travel agents such as travelocity, Expedia, Priceline.com, last \nminute.com; on-line travel portals such as Orbitz in the US, Opodo in Europe, and \nAsia-portal; tour operators and consolidators. The indirect channels are backed up by \nGlobal Distribution Systems (GDSs)1. \n \nFigure 2: Airlines Distribution Channels \n \nA large proportion, as much as three quarters, of airline tickets are sold through \nconventional travel agents. The chart below illustrates the major European scheduled \nairlines distribution by different channels. \n \nFigure 3: European Major Airline Distribution Channels \n \nWhile travel agents are still airlines main channel of distribution, it is the most \nexpensive method of ticket distribution.  A comparison of cost of distribution by \ndifferent channel is provided in Figure 4. \n \nFigure 4: Airline Distribution Costs by Sales Channel - $300 Ticket  \nSource: JP Morgan, 1999 \n \n3. Airline and Agent Relationship Developments in the US and \nEurope \n \nCommissions, which after labour and fuel are the third largest expense faced by \nairlines, climbed from 4.3% of total operating costs in the USA in 1978 to 10.9% in \n1993 (Airline Business Oct 2000).  This was at the time when US economy was still \nin recession and airlines were making huge losses. Therefore, the pressure on airlines \nto reduce costs was more than ever. In February 1995, several US carriers including \nAmerican, Continental, Delta Air Lines, Northwest and United capped travel agents \ncommission rates for domestic travel at $25 one way and $50 return.  \n \nIn September 1996, the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) took a number of \nairlines to court claiming that they had broken US competition laws by acting in \ncollusion. The five airlines went for an out-of-court settlement by paying $77 million. \nHowever they denied any wrongdoing, and stated that the action had been settled to \navoid the diversion of management time and effort to such matters.  However the \ncapping has stayed in place.  \n \nIn late 1999, most major US carriers slashed travel agent commission rates from 8% \nto 5%, this was at the time when travel agent groups were complaining about airlines \nefforts to steer customers towards Internet bookings. US carriers now pay a 5% \ncommission on both domestic and international tickets; commissions on roundtrip \n                                                          \n1 GDSs link customers and airlines electronically in the travel market place.  Their databases \nrely on access to real-time inventory and pricing information within the suppliers\u2019 own \nsystems. \n \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  4\ndomestic tickets are capped at $50, while those on roundtrip international tickets are \ncapped at $100. Consequently, commission expenses have declined, dropping back to \nless than 5% of expenses from their high in the early 1990s. Figure 5 illustrates US \ncarriers\u2019 commission costs per revenue passenger mile \n \nFigure 5: US Airline Commission Costs per Revenue Passenger Miles \nSource: ATA, 2000 \n \nSouthwest Airlines, the only US major airline, which continued, paying travel agents \na full 10% commission with no caps, announced in December 2000 that it would cut \nagent commissions starting 1 January 2001. Under a new commitment with the \nAmerican Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), Southwest has agreed to pay an 8% \ncommission on all ticketless transactions issued by traditional travel agencies, and 5% \ncommission on all paper ticket transactions. A cap of $30 on a one-way fare and of \n$60 on a roundtrip fare will apply to both commission levels.  \n \nThe majors were not alone in adopting the cuts. Several smaller US carriers, including \nAmerican Trans Air, America West, Alaska Airlines and Midwest Express, were \nquick to follow with similar reductions.  \n \nLarge European carriers began in 1998 to lower agent commissions in their home \nmarket from 9% to around 7% for international routes and as low as 4% on domestic \nroutes.  European majors also announced that in other European markets they would \nfollow the commission policy of the home carrier.  This is because in most cases they \nare the dominant carrier in the home market, whereas in other European markets they \ncannot exercise much leverage with agents, as their markets share is limited.  British \nAirways was the first European carrier to reduce commission fees to agents in 1998 \nand eventually introduced a flat fee policy in April 2001.  Table below illustrates \nBA\u2019s commission levels compared with a typical commission at 7%. \n \nTable 1: British Airways Sector Payments\/Roundtrip \n \nKLM also replaced their 7% commission rates with a fixed service fee of \u00a322 per \nticket in January 2001 (Travel Weekly, January 2001). Lufthansa is another major \nEuropean airline to introduce a flat fee from 1 January 2002 in Germany.  It is \nproposing to pay between $8 and $150 per sector booking depending on the class of \ntravel and destination. \n \nLarge companies are also becoming more sophisticated in the way they buy travel \nproducts and are more aware of their leverage in negotiating volume discounts with \nairlines to reduce travel costs.  An increasing number of corporates have developed \ntravel policies to the extent that more that 50% of business travellers are subject to \nsome form of policy laid down by the company for whom they work.  A survey by \nCarlson Wagonlit (1998)  indicated that some 79% of companies have a travel policy. \n \nA survey by Mason (2001) in the UK market demonstrates that larger companies are \nmore likely to have a travel policy as illustrated below. \n \nTable 2: Company Travel Policy by Size \n \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  5\nAirlines are also increasingly dealing directly with their corporate customers, \nbypassing the agency entirely. For example, Continental, which derives over 50% of \nits revenues from business travellers, has established net fares for its corporate \ncustomers. Such fares, which are widespread in the USA, involve major discounts on \npublished tariffs paid directly to the corporate customer. In these arrangements, \ncarriers bypass the corporation's agency entirely, paying it no commission. The \nagency then is left to derive its income from travel management service fees it charges \nthe corporation.   \n \nThere appears a steady increase in Internet-generated bookings among US and \nEuropean airlines with the low costs carriers leading the way as illustrated in Figure \n6.  The majority of low cost carriers\u2019 on-line sales are on their own web site whereas \nthe large schedule carriers on-line sales are through their own web site and on-line \ntravel agents such as Travelocity, Expedia, Priceline.com and so on.  For example \n50% of Delta Air Lines\u2019 on-line booking is done by the airline site and the rest by on-\nline travel agencies.  It can be seen from Figure 6 that major carriers sell a very small \nproportion of their tickets on-line. This is mainly due to the fact that they are not \nperceived by passengers as natural. \n \n To reduce the cost of distribution and increasing on-line sales 5 airlines - United \nAirlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest and Continental Airlines- in \nthe US have invested in a multi-airline travel portal, Orbitz.  Some 30 airlines have \nbecome the charter associates of Orbitz. The GDS behind Orbitz is Worldspan with \nwhich the company has an agreement to rebate member carriers one-third of the usual \nGDS booking fee.  All other carriers will have their information displayed on Orbitz, \nbut must pay the full GDS fee (Kirby, 2001). In Europe, the same policy has been \nadopted by BA, Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia, KLM, Iberia, SAS, Aer Lingus, \nAustrian Airlines, British Midland and Finnair to launch a European on-line portal \ncalled Opodo.  \n \nFigure 6: On-line Sales As % of Total (2000) \n3.1 Travel agents\u2019 role \n \nThe role of agents has been changing from reservations to the provision of advice and \nconsultancy for corporations. Agents, both in the US and Europe, appear to have been \nforced to change the nature of their business by charging corporate and leisure clients \nmanagement or transaction fees for their services  (Alamdari and Mason, 2000). They \nact as advisors to their corporate clients, helping them develop and enforce travel \nmanagement policies. \n \nThey have also moved away from an over-dependence on airline commissions in \nrecent years, concentrating instead on more lucrative market segments like cruises, \ntours and vacation packages.  \n \nThe changes in airline distribution policy have led to a drop in the number of retail \nagency locations in the US by 9% from 33,593 in 1995 to 30,886 in 2000.  The cuts \nhave reduced the average commission payment by over 50%. To compensate for this \nfall in income, at least three-quarters of agencies in the US charge service fees \n(Airline Business, Oct 2000). \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  6\n \nLarge business agents appear to have accepted the change in their relationship with \nairlines and corporates.  They believe that management fees are the way to create an \neffective link between airlines and customers.  Carlson Wagonlit Travel has set up a \ntravel consultancy service with the aim to manage and optimise their clients' travel \nspend. However the larger business travel agents believe that the costs involved in \nrunning a travel management company are pushed up by the increasing demands of \ncorporate clients. \n \nSmaller agencies are joining forces, through merger or consolidation, with larger \nagencies. Size is important because agencies that generate over $100 million in sales \ncan swing business to preferred airline partners that will reward them with override \npayments and discounted air fares, which they can mark up for higher profit.  \n \nIt appears that independent small agents are under threats due to the commission cuts \nunless they are specialised in niche markets and have a good understanding of clients\u2019 \nneeds. Alternatively, they become franchisee of large agents such American Express \nor Carlson Wagonlit, to give them access to brand name and market credibility. \n \n \n4. Airline and Travel Agent Relationship Developments in Asia-\nPacific \n \nAs discussed in the previous sections, the tendency towards agent commission cuts \nand direct sell has been prevailing in the European and US airline industry due to the \never-increasing distribution costs since early 1990s.  The moves were further \nenhanced by the innovations of new electronic distribution channels and change of \nconsumers\u2019 habits.  However, in Asia-Pacific, the fastest-growing air transport \nregions of the world, carriers are still wavering on the way to the battlefield of \ndistribution.  Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to assess if the trend \nwill be followed by the Asia Pacific carriers, and whether there are any obstacles \npreventing them from following their counterpart in Europe and USA in cutting agent \ncommissions. \n  \nA market survey was conducted, in August of 1999, in the form of questionnaires in \nselected countries of Asia Pacific, where the Internet penetration and air transport \nmarket are developed2.  Thus, the questionnaire was sent out to 11 Asian airlines in 8 \ncountries, plus two foreign carriers\u2019 branch offices in the area. Of the 13 airlines \ncontacted eight replied.  A response rate of around 62%.   \n \nThe responding carriers were: Cathay Pacific, Japan Air Lines, Air Macau, Malaysia \nAirlines, China Airlines, EVA Airways, Thai Airways, United Airlines \u2013 Taipei \nbranch  \n4.1 Current distribution strategies \n \nTable 3 shows the current distribution channels used by the responding carriers and \ntheir significance to ticket sales.  Of the 8 respondents, all sold tickets through travel \n                                                          \n2 This survey was carried out by Henry Wu, a Cranfield MSc student, under the supervision of the \nAuthor. \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  7\nagents and their own ticketing offices or call centers.  All of the responding carriers \nindicated that above 80 percent of their companies\u2019 ticket sales are made through \ntravel agents.  In contrast, the new electronic channels only accounted for a trivial \nshare.   \n \nIt is worth noting that, though the results showed an unexpected high percentage of \nAsian carries using Internet as a ticket sell channel, only United Airlines and Japan \nAirlines had online booking functions over the Web sites at the time of survey.  The \nremaining three carriers generally only offered the promotional pricing information, \nonline ticket auctions or online special purchase over the Net, yet the booking and \nticketing are still made through travel agents or airline reservation staff.        \n  \nTable 3:  Distribution Channels & Their Significance to Ticket Sales \n \nTicketless travel, mainly used for domestic traffic, has been around in Asia Pacific \nmarket for years, but only Malaysia Airlines set up the automatic teller machine \n(ATM) for ticketless travelers at selected locations.  Passengers could make quick \nbookings, make online payments by credit card, select seats, and obtain the boarding  \npasses by using one machine. \n \nUnited Airlines is the only carrier marketing its corporate online software, United \nConnection, in the Asia Pacific market; however, the contracts and sales must be \nmade between the headquarter and intended companies, instead of the local branch \noffices.  The respondent from United Airlines indicated that the Intranet could hardly \ngain popularity in corporate markets, due to very low-profile promotion and agents\u2019 \nprotests. \n \n4.2 Travel agents remuneration \n \nAt time of survey, the majority of Asia-Pacific carriers maintain their relations with \ntravel agents by offering different types of compensation including base commission, \nover-ride commissions and consolidator overrides.  Amongst 8 responding carriers, 7 \nprovided base commission, normally 7-9% of ticket price.  Air Macau does not offer \nbase commission because the airline applied the \u2018Net Fare\u2019 system to all fare types, \nwithout granting issuing agents a certain level of commission.  In the Asian air \ntransport market, this system is widely used for all discounted fare types, letting travel \nagents add a mark-up to the given net price for their own profits.  All of respondents \noffered over-ride commission or back-end incentives, a remuneration program \ngranting agents \u2018bonus\u2019 commission provided their ticket revenues exceeded the \ntargeted levels set by airlines.   \n \n \nFigure 7: Asian Airlines Type of Compensations \n \n \nOver half of respondents had marketing agreements with tour operator or ticket \nconsolidators, who in most cases were entitled to a higher rebate or incentive levels \nwhich were specified in respective contracts.   \n \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  8\nThe responding carriers unanimously agreed that high levels of agent commission and \nincentive overrides are both effective ways of generating their companies\u2019 ticket \nrevenues.  Almost two thirds of the respondents indicated that their companies \nincreased commission levels to boost ticket sales during 1998 to 1999. \n \nHowever, a powerful marketing tool as agent compensation is, to most airlines, the \ncurrent commission payments had presented a threat to their operating cost structures. \nThree quarter of respondents pointed out that the payment had constituted a financial \nburden to their companies.  While asked how their companies were going to cope \nwith the problem, China Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines said they \nwere trying to increase the direct share of ticket sales in order to avoid over-\ndependence on travel agents.  China Airlines and Malaysia airlines have started their \nelectronic ticketing trials in domestic or regional markets. Cathay claimed the first \ntrial of online ticket auction proved very successful, and the company might consider \nexpanding the services to wider markets.  The foreign carrier, United Airlines, took a \nmore aggressive step preventing the cost from increasing, reducing its international \ncommission from 9% to 7%.  The company also intended to increase the number of \ncorporate net deals with local companies in an attempt to control ticket distribution \ncosts. This is very different from the trend in USA and Europe where commission \ncuts were always introduced by the home carriers and followed by foreign airlines. \n \nAlthough the majority of sampled carriers had identified the threats of ever-increasing \nagent commission cost and gradually established more direct-sell channels, except for \nfew foreign and Japanese carriers, they were still hesitating on the moves towards \ncommission reductions.  Table 4 lists the reasons why Asia-Pacific carriers had not \nfollowed suit, in the same way that European and US carriers initiated commission \ncaps from 1995. \n    \n Table 4: Reasons Why Asia-Pacific Carriers Did Not Speed-up Commission Cuts   \n \nAs can be seen from the Table above, the powerful role of travel agents in controlling \nticket distributions was the major reason preventing the airlines to take actions in \ncutting commissions.  As most of Asian corporations had outsourced the travel \ndepartment to travel agencies and leisure travelers traditionally preferred to purchase \ntour packages from agents, a drop in agent commission could mean a decline in \nmarket shares and passenger revenues.  A quarter of responding carriers also referred \nto the present less-than-perfect electronic channels as a factor discouraging them from \ntaking part in the battle with travel agents.  Only one respondent said that no similar \nactions taken by other Asian carriers led to the current unchanged situation in Asia-\nPacific travel markets.                  \n \n \n \n4.3 Development of direct distribution channels \n \nFigure 8 illustrates the present and future developments of direct sell channels among \nAsia-Pacific carriers  \n \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  9\nFigure 8: Present & Future Developments of E-Channels by Asian Carriers \n \nAs can be seen from 8, the current direct sell channels of Asia-Pacific carriers were \nrelatively far behind by their European and US counterparts.  However, a majority of \nresponding carriers indicated that their companies would offer ticketless travel \nservices in the future.   \n \nIn contrast, responding carriers showed relatively little interest in developing the \nIntranet, and smart cards.  The respondent of China Airlines pointed out that the small \nfrequent flyer base and large numbers of individual business travellers discouraged \ntheir companies from developing these business-oriented distribution products.  As \nmany corporations had outsourced business travel to large business travel agencies, it \nmight not be viable for Asia-Pacific carriers to market online booking software to \ntheir corporate accounts.   \n \nTable 5 lists a number of prerequisites considered by the sampled airlines prior to the \ndevelopments of electronic channels and their significance to airlines\u2019 decisions.  \n \nTable 5:Prerequisites Considered Prior to Electronic Developments & Their \nSignificance to Asia-Pacific Carriers\u2019 Decisions \n \nThe majority of responding carriers thought the Internet penetration rate would \nsignificantly affect their decisions whether to establish electronic channels or not.  \nThe current less-than-perfect technology was also regarded as a barrier to airlines \nincreasing the bulk of ticket sales through the Internet or other online booking \nsystems.  A third of respondents also indicated their companies would consider \ndeveloping electronic channels provided they were threatened by the competition.  A \nquarter of respondents also concerned about the security of online transactions as \nusers were afraid their credit card information being leaked out to the third parties.   \n \nAs some research indicates (Hughes, 2001) that airline ticket sales have become the \nlargest and fastest growing travel-related category online, the results of this Asia-\nPacific carrier survey are somewhat less promising.  Nearly 40% of responding \ncarriers still treated the Internet more as a media with public relations functions than \nas a potential direct sell channel.  This might explain why the airlines remained so \nconservative in expanding online services over the Net. This is backed up by \nMcKinsey\u2019 s research  (2001) in Figure 9, which shows only one country in Asia \nPacific is listed in the top 10 countries with highest proportion of internet active users. \n \nFigure 10 demonstrates the current and planned online services included in the \nairlines\u2019 web sites.  Apart from online schedule check and Internet booking, Asian \ncarriers were relatively reluctant to fully utilize the potential of Internet in ticket sales.  \nAll of them were planning to equip online booking facilities on their web sites; \nhowever, only half would like to provide online pricing information for Internet users.  \nEVA Airways stated that unless Internet bookings could be carried out with ticketless \ntravel, most of online bookings still had to be ticketed by travel agents.  Therefore, the \nairline thought it was unnecessary and risky to provide airfares online, as other \ncompetitors could be simply aware of its marketing activities.  Apart from this, Asia-\nPacific carriers seemed less keen to promote online, only 25% of respondents \nconsidered an addition of online auction services to their current web sites in the \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  10\nfuture. \n \nFigure 9: Top 10 countries with active internet users1 (2000) \n1 adults, 18 and older, who access the web at least 1 time a week for 1 hour \nSource: McKinsey, 2001 \n \n Figure 10: Services On Web Sites: Present \/ Future \n \nThough having very conservative attitudes towards online service expansion, Asia-\nPacific carriers had mostly agreed that developing new electronic channels was an \ninevitable trend and had been incorporated into their distribution plans.  The majority \nof responding carriers pointed out that in the future their companies would adopted \nthe parallel distribution strategies \u2013 relying on travel agents and simultaneously \ndeveloping more direct channels for ticket sales.  \n \nAll responding carriers indicated that the tendency to sell tickets through parallel \nchannels could avoid over-dependence on traditional travel intermediaries.  Some \n63% pointed out that their companies could benefit from cost saving as the share of \npassenger revenue generated by travel agents declined.  A small proportion thought \nthe airline could optimize the size of sales and ticketing department to increase labor \nproductivity.  With the direct sales channels, one of respondents said it could offer \nmore customized services to customers as it could have more \u2018direct dialogues\u2019 with \nwould-be passengers.   \n \nWhen asked how new technology would influence the regional travel industry, all of \nrespondents predicted that more new players would enter the industry on the basis of \nelectronic delivery (Figure 11).  Three of respondents indicated that consumers would \nincreasingly play a vital role in the travel distribution chain as they could fully decide \ntheir purchase patterns through a multiplicity of sell channels.  Their behaviours and \ndesires would be referred to as a guideline by airlines about developing new \ndistribution strategies and allocating their resources through different channels.         \n \nFigure 11:Impact of Technology on Asia-Pacific Travel Market \n \nA quarter predicted that there would be a consolidation of travel agency industry in \nthe regions.  Unlike in the US or Europe where the industry was undergoing a process \nof integration or alliance formation, the Asian currently remained very fragmented.  \nOnly one carrier thought the travel agents would be ultimately bypassed due to \ndisintermediation.        \n \n4.4 Impact of Technology on Asia-Pacific Travel Market  \n \nClearly those carriers whose home markets had a higher percentage of Internet \npopulation would be more likely to establish new channels than would others.  This \nalso suggests that there would be a varied, inconsistent pace of uptake of new \ntechnology among Asia-Pacific carriers due to the disproportionate Internet \npenetration rate of the region.                   \n \nJudging from the airline distribution trend in the US and Europe, the majority of \nairlines initially confined the trials of new direct sell channels to their domestic \nmarket.  This also accounts for the slow uptake of new electronic channels in \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  11\nEuropean and Asia-Pacific markets where the international traffic is prevalent. As \nindicated by Negline (2000) a lot of business traffic in Asia is not point to point, but \nrather triangular in nature. Therefore, often, more than one airline is involved in the \nbooking, which further complicates the scope of a single airline to build an effective \nonline sales presence.  \n  \nAlso the global alliance groupings should accelerate the pace of Asia Pacific member \nairlines catching up the distribution trend.  The Asian carriers, who are a member of \nmajor alliance groupings, would be keener to develop consistent levels of services \nwith their US and European alliance co-members to minimize inconveniences for \ntravellers taking code-share or interline flights.  The results show that responding \nairlines that currently are alliance members would be a little more aggressive to \nestablish new electronic channels than non-alliance members would.    \n \nAlthough Asian carriers have been slightly trailing their European and US \ncounterparts in launching internet-based offerings some moves are taking place.  \nRecently nine of the region's carriers announced that they were joining forces to \nlaunch an online travel exchange. The exchange combines Air New Zealand, Ansett \nAustralia, Asiana, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Royal \nBrunei Airlines and Singapore Airlines. The joint venture will be operated and \ngoverned as a new business entity separate from each of the airlines, and run by an \nindependent management team. \n \nAt the same time a few carriers have also followed the developments in commission \ncutting in the US and Europe very recently.  Singapore Airline in October 1999 \nremoved commission for published fares (also known as zero commission), and \nintroduced documentation fees for agents when they issue published fare ticket. In \nSeptember 2000 Singapore introduced nett fare ticketing, meaning that the actual \nagent fare is printed on the ticket.  Therefore passengers get to know the cost of the \nticket and hence the amount of mark-up by the agents. \n \nCathay Pacific has also cut the commissions it pays its Hong Kong agents - which \ngenerate over 30% of its bookings in Hong Kong - from 9% to 7%.  JAL has \nannounced at the beginning of 2001 its intention to reduce commission on ticket sales \nfrom 9% to 7% in a few European countries and pay 5% commission for domestic \ntravel within Japan. \n \nOn-line travel agencies are also moving to Asian markets. Travelocity and Expedia, \nthe two leading on-line travel agencies with 70% of on-line travel sales market have \noperations in Canada, Europe as well as in the USA. It is reported Travelocity is \nestablishing an on-line distribution system in Asia (Air Transport Intelligence News, \n2001). \n \nIt appears that the trend of airline distribution in Asia-Pacific region is following the \nrecent trend but it will be more like that in Europe, rather than in the US.  Establishing \nonline presence in Europe or Asia is more difficult than it is in the US.  This is \nbecause both in Asia and Europe one needs to have local sites in all nations and all \nlanguages as opposed to one site and one language. The Table below compares \nairlines\u2019 and consumers\u2019 attitudes towards electronic channels, air transport market, \nInternet penetration rate and regional travel industry. \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  12\n \n \nTable 6: Comparisons of Airline Distribution by Regions \n \n5. Conclusions  \n \nIt is clear that the role of travel agents in all regions has changed, though, at different \nspeed.  While US airlines are aggressively trying to by-pass agents European and \nespecially Asian carriers have been more conservative.  Although major carriers have \nidentified that developing direct sell strategies based on electronic delivery would be \nan inevitable trend in the scenario of future ticket distribution, they have not been \nsuccessful in completely by-passing travel agents and as a result their share of direct \nsell has remained very small.   Factors affecting airlines\u2019 direct sell are: \n  \n\u2022 The positions of travel agents: \nAs travel agents represented the lion\u2019s shares of airlines\u2019 passenger revenues, \nairlines, especially those in Asia-Pacific markets, fear that their move towards \ndirect sell will create negative reactions from travel agents leading to loss of \nmarket share.   \n \n\u2022 Internet penetration rate: \nClearly the more access customers have to internet the higher is the possibility of \npurchasing airline tickets directly.  For example, in Asia, except specific areas like \nHong Kong and Singapore, the rest of the region still have relatively low Internet \npenetration, compared with the US and European markets.  The airlines do not \nfind it viable to sell tickets through new channels, as only a small proportion of \nconsumers will have access to it.   \n \n\u2022 Consumer attitudes: \nFor decades, travellers, business or leisure, have greatly relied on travel agents for \ntravel information and tour packages.  It is their stereotype that they could have \nbetter deals and more neutral advice from agents than airline staff.  In most cases, \ntravel agents could have a great impact on customers\u2019 choices of airlines.  The \ncustomers also are concerned with the security of purchasing tickets online.  \n \nWith these issues, most airlines with the exception of low costs carriers still rely on \ntravel agents for the bulk of ticket sales in the near future.  However, they will \nsimultaneously establish more new direct sell channels as they can alter the \neconomics of distributing tickets.  Among these alternative channels, the Internet \nbooking and electronic ticketing are the main fields where most of the airlines will \ncompete.  However, the pace will vary from region to region and airline to airline as \neach has different attitudes towards the application of new technology to ticket \ndistribution.   \n \nThe following trend is expected to take place in airline distribution in the near future: \n \n\u2022 As US and European airlines have benefited from the savings of distribution \ncosts, Asian carriers will speed up their move towards the distribution \nrevolution to have a similar competitive cost base.     \n \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  13\n\u2022 The alliance carrier will take actions in establishing electronic distribution \nchannels in order to keep up with their counterparts in other regions.  \nAlthough electronic ticketing is not yet possible between alliance partners. \n \n\u2022 Though being the mainstream method of distribution, traditional travel agents \nwill see their shares of airline ticket sales gradually deteriorating as a result of \nthe emergence of alternative channels.   \n \n\u2022 The travel agency industry is expected to undergo a process of consolidation \nin the near future as a result of the new threats from commission cuts and \ndirect sales channels.  However, the pace of consolidations is estimated to be \nmuch slower in Asia-Pacific in comparison with that in European and US \nmarkets.  The independent smaller agents are more likely to find it difficult to \nadjust their position. They are not large enough to provide a full service to \ncorporates.  Therefore, they could become under threat due to: less leverage to \nget good airline deals, the development of IT is too costly, and they cannot \ninfluence corporate choice.  \n \n\u2022 It can be predicted that the relations between travel agents and airlines will \ncontinue to be unsettled as the awareness of the need to reduce the distribution \ncosts prevails among all air carriers.  The tensions will be exacerbated by \nairlines\u2019 moves towards the developments of direct sell channels.  However, it \nis perceived that the conflict in Asia-Pacific will not be as severe as that in \nEurope and US because agents in Asia are more used to the idea after \nwitnessing the trends in commission cutting in the US and Europe  \n \n\u2022 Due to the present constraints of technology and lack of perceived \nindependence by customers, the direct channels will only represent a small \nportion of total airline ticket sales.   In the future, these channels may only win \nground in the domestic or point-to-point markets. The situation would be \ndifferent for low costs carriers, as they are usually perceived by customers \noffering the lowest fare in the market.  Therefore it is more feasible for these \ncarriers to sell direct to passengers. \n \n\u2022 In the future, customers will select channels, whether direct or traditional, \naccording to the complexity of itineraries and their own purchasing \nexperience.  It is forecasted that the electronic channels will win ground in the \nlow complexity and value-added area.  However, there will still be the need \nfor complex journeys and high value-added travel services to be handled by \ntravel agents.  \n \n\u2022 As the internet penetration rates increases and internet technology improves \nthe on-line travel agents will gain more popularity. As this channel meets two \nimportant criteria in relation to customer choice of channels.  First they are \nperceived as to be relatively independent and impartial, and second it would \nbe a faster and more efficient way of purchasing airline tickets.   \n \n \nDr Fariba Alamdari, Air Transport Group, Cranfield College of Aeronautics  14\n\u2022 It appears that the trend of airline distribution in Asia-Pacific region will be \nmore like that in Europe, rather than in the US.   \n \nTravel agents will certainly have a role to play in all the regions but they need to \nmove away from being a ticket booker to providing value added service to both \nindividual and corporate customers especially in the area of complex itineraries. They \nmust adapt to stay afloat in the internet era. The opportunities remain for those quick-\nthinking agencies that use the new technologies to stay ahead of the game. \n \n \n6.
