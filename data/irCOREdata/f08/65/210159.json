As Philip Tetlock","authors":[],"date":"2005","doi":null,"raw":"10 Often these processes generate their own pathologies. As Philip Tetlock (2005) points out, specialists are actually less good at predicting events in their field as non-experts, having a tendency to over-extrapolate from the past to the future. This is, in many ways, unsurprising. After all, experts are not neutral observers but partisans who have a vested interest in explaining and predicting a certain chain of events. As such, they have an in-built tendency towards motivated bias and groupthink, a point well made thirty years ago by Robert Jervis (1976) and more recently by Michael Freeden (2003). 11 Illustrative examples of fruitful interdisciplinarity include the concept of \u2018punctuated equilibrium\u2019, first mooted by the biologist Stephen Jay Gould to describe the switch-points in which long periods of stable reproduction within complex systems are punctuated by short, periods of rapid change. Gould\u2019s concept has been usefully transported into numerous \u2018soft\u2019 academic sciences. Another pertinent example is the concept of \u2018path dependence\u2019 which originated in economic history and has become used in many disciplines to describe how small initial distinctions are amplified over time, becoming substantial schisms which are then difficult to reverse. 12 The series on British television which Meades fronted on the architecture of the Third Reich and Soviet Russia is illustrative of the ways in which complex ideas can be translated \u2013 often through humour \u2013 without sacrificing intellectual content. 13 I am grateful to Paul Kirby for stressing this point to me. 14 For example, much of the debate about theory in IR is a rehash of a much older division between the Austrian School and the German Historical School over scientific method: the Methodenstreit. The German Historical School argued that, rather than focusing on universal truisms modelled on homo economicus, the line which was pursued by the Austrian School of classical economists, economic processes operated within a social framework which was in turn shaped by cultural and historical forces. Hence, Gustav Schmoller and his associates favoured historical, comparative research that could uncover the distinctive properties of particular economic systems. The core debates of the original Methodenstreit continue to reverberate around contemporary social science and, in particular, IR: the degree to which people\u2019s actions are shaped by their social, historical and normative contexts as opposed to the view of individuals as universally driven homo politicus or homo economicus; preferences as exogenously generated by social institutions or the endogenous result of primal drives; rationality as a broad category embracing a range of motivations versus rationality as a narrow, limited realm of utility maximisation.","cites":null},{"id":17208236,"title":"A Disastrous Division\u2019.","authors":[],"date":"2005","doi":null,"raw":"Steinmetz, George.

It is public in that it \nseeks to engage the public in a process of dialogue \u2026 it cannot seek to stay within the \nboundaries of the specialist community while studying the rest of society from \noutside. Robert Bellah, Habits of the Heart (1985). \n \nThe end of the Cold War may have been a tragedy for some2 but for the discipline of \nInternational Relations (IR) it represented the onset of the boom years. So long constrained, \nboth theoretically and empirically, by the stranglehold of the Cold War and its Anglo-\nAmerican monopoly on methods, concepts and analytical frameworks, the multiple openings \nof the past decade and a half have served, in many ways, to enrich the study of world politics. \nA broadening out of what is considered to be the legitimate terrain of International Relations \nhas helped to generate an interstitial opening in which novel frameworks, concepts and issue \nareas have appeared, many of them extremely productive. At the same time, the surge of \npublic interest in international relations \u2013 albeit more in lieu of its subject matter than its \ndisciplinary apertures \u2013 has seen a major roll out in new courses and programmes. As the \nworld has gone global and politics has gone international, so IR has cashed in.  \n And yet, as the discipline has responded to the openings of the post-Cold War era, \nso deficiencies with its theoretical, analytical and conceptual frameworks have become \nstriking. This is hardly surprising \u2013 the rapidity of change in the contemporary world \nprecludes easy analysis. Yet, albeit with some notable exceptions listed below, it is troubling \nquite how incapable much of the discipline has been at speaking to the imminent range of \npuzzles, questions and problems posed by the hows, whys and wherefores of the \ncontemporary conjuncture: the extent to which the essential grammar of world politics has \nbeen disturbed by the shift in the political imaginary from Westphalia to multiple, often \ndeterritorialised, political spaces (although see Ruggie, 1993; Cerny, 1995; Buzan and Little \n2000), from superpower competition to American imperium (although see Barkawi and \nLaffey, 1999; Cox, 2001; and Ikenberry, 2004), and from a discussion of material capabilities \nto relative intangibles such as religion (although see Petito and Hatzapoulos eds., 2003), race \n(although see Shilliam, 2006; Hobson, 2007) and culture (although see Walker, 1990; Lapid \nand Kratochwil eds., 1996; Etzioni 2004).3  \n \n2 \n Rather than embracing these deep rooted challenges, IR has largely sought to contain \nthem within existing paradigms and problem-fields. This has contributed to a knock-on effect \nin which precious few IR theories, old or new, speak effectively to emerging issues which \nmove away from existing paradigmatic frontiers: the rise in ethnic conflict (although see \nGagnon, 2006), the dangers of democratisation (although see Mansfield and Snyder, 2005), \nthe emergence of jihadism (although see Halliday, 2005) or the influence of neo-\nconservatism (although see Williams, 2005). Even when IR has succeeded in breaking out of \ninternecine debates about polarity, balancing and the like, it has tended to abandon its \nprimary toolkits. Hence, the analysis provided by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt (2006, \n2007) about the overbearing role of an \u2018Israeli lobby\u2019 in the shaping of US foreign policy \nmay have been many things \u2013 but rooted in realism does not appear to be one of them.4  \n There are a number of reasons why IR has struggled to keep pace with the uncertain \nlandscape of the post-Cold War era: the stickiness of Cold War problem fields and \napproaches; the speed to which cognate disciplines have colonised turf one might reasonably \nexpect to be occupied by IR (globalisation, empire, and war being some of the more obvious \nexamples); the elevation of theoretical and metatheoretical debates in IR over empirical and \nsubstantive engagements (Brown, 2006); the continued attachment to systemic-level theories, \nwhether Waltzian, Wendtian or Buzanian;5 and the tendency of the new breadth of IR to \nfoster disciplinary fracturing and tribalism. All too often analytical and conceptual \nframeworks have led to empirical short circuits, or worse, to their abandonment when \nconfronted by the world of \u2018actually existing international politics\u2019. Even as IR has increased \nin popularity and seen its agenda broadened, so the discipline has struggled to speak to the \nworld within which it is situated and which it is charged to study.  \n Interestingly, there is another discipline which has faced similar travails in recent \nyears \u2013 sociology. And it may be that the debate within sociology about what to do about the \ndissonance between professional development, empirical work and normative engagement \nmay offer some useful pointers as to how IR can reconnect with the post-Cold War \nlandscape. The first part of this article looks at attempts by some figures in sociology to \nreconfigure the discipline as \u2018public\u2019. The second part examines in more depth what this \nproject entails and what it precludes, highlighting three pathologies that a public academic \nenterprise needs to avoid. The third section outlines some basic tenets \u2013 amounting to a \nmanifesto of sorts \u2013 for a public International Relations. A brief conclusion summarises the \nargument and suggests ways to take this agenda forward. \n \n \n3 \nA PUBLIC SOCIOLOGY \n \nThe call to make academic enquiry more relevant to the world in which it is situated is hardly \nnew. Indeed, each generation appears to recognise the dangers of an ivory towered cocooning \nof the intellectual imagination. Hence, the presidential address to the fifth American Political \nScience Association by James Bryce (1909:4-5) nearly 100 years ago warned that,  \n \nAll the general propositions and leading principles of politics get their significance \nand value from their illustrations in concrete. When severed from these they become \nnot only comparatively lifeless but also less helpful, because we do not grasp their \ndirect application \u2026  Some writers have tried to treat it (political science) as a set of \nabstractions \u2026 following the methods of metaphysics and keeping as far from the \nconcrete as possible. So much time and toil have been spent on these discussions, but \nwhat have they given us of substantial worth? \n \nSimilar statements have been issued by senior figures in US sociology throughout the post \nwar period: in 1946, Carl Taylor (1947:8), President of the American Sociological \nAssociation (ASA), warned that \u2018it takes graduate students five to ten years to recover from \nwhat happens to them on their graduate training\u2019; in 1963, Everett Hughes (1963:890), also \nPresident of the ASA, argued that, \u2018while professionalisation may raise the competence of \nsome, it also limits creative activity, by denying license (PhD) to some who let their \nimagination and their observations run fair afield and by putting candidates for their license  \nso long into a straightjacket that they never move freely again\u2019; in 1968, Martin Nicolaus \nfamously berated both his fellow panellist (Wilbur Cohen, Secretary for Health, Education \nand Welfare) and the broader membership of the ASA for favouring \u2018fat cat\u2019 and \u2018jet set\u2019 \nsociology which was unable to speak to the wider milieu within which sociologists worked; \nnearly a decade later, the presidential address to the ASA by Alfred McClung Lee (1976) \nentitled \u2018sociology for whom?\u2019 lamented the broad habitualisation of both sociology and \nsociologists into a professional enterprise which was becoming increasingly distanced from \nits field of enquiry.  \n Over recent years, there has been a renewed attempt within sociology to reconnect the \ndiscipline with its original vocation, \u2018searching for order in the broken fragments of \nmodernity\u2019 as Walter Benjamin famously described the task of the angel of history. Indeed, \nthe former president of the ASA, Michael Burawoy, has argued in numerous texts (2004, \n2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2006; see also Gans, 1989; Blau and Smith eds., 2006) that sociology \nhas become tamed and disciplined, immersed in a \u2018fractology\u2019 which has seen it lose its triple \nengagement \u2013 at once theoretical, empirical and normative \u2013 with the ambivalences of \n \n4 \nmodernity. Burawoy argues that the principle raison d\u2019\u00eatre of sociology is its defence of \nmodernity\u2019s losers rather than the lauding of its victors. As such, sociologists should study \nsocial ruptures and dislocations not just in the abstract but with an overt commitment to \ngrounded research and to the possibility of progressive change. For Burawoy, although it is \npossible to recall many public sociologists from both the past and the present who considered \nthis ethos as their main motivation \u2013 from Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Tocqueville and T\u00f6nnies \nto W.E.B. Du Bois, Pitrim Sorokin, David Riesman, Robert Bellah, Daniel Bell, C. Wright \nMills, Raymond Aron, Pierre Bourdieu, Alaine Touraine, Charles Tilly, and Michael Mann \u2013 \nthere has been a sense of a decline in the sociological imagination which would have been \nfamiliar to at least one of these scholars (Mills, 1959) some fifty years ago.  \n The debate over public sociology has been extensive (see, for example, special issues \ndevoted to the subject in Social Forces, 2004; the British Journal of Sociology, 2005; \nAmerican Sociologist, 2005; and Critical Sociology, 2005). Critics vary their charges: there is \nuncertainty about the autonomy of any sociological (Calhoun, 2005; Ericson, 2005; Ghamari-\nTabrizi, 2005), or disciplinary (Braithwaite, 2005; Hall, 2005; Aronowitz, 2005) division of \nlabour; broader questions about whether public sociology constitutes a discrete field of \nenquiry (Urry, 2005); charges of arrogance (Tittle, 2004); and complaints about fostering \nactivism by the back door (Nielsen, 2004). Some of these critiques hit home. It is self-\nevidently the case, for instance, that academic research is inherently public, communicated as \nit is via multiple public channels whether these be academic, media or policy-oriented. In \naddition to this, there are well-rehearsed difficulties in delineating what should be considered \n\u2018progressive\u2019, in valorising activism (Shaw and Walker, 2006), or in romanticising civil \nsociety (Calhoun, 2005). Much of civil society is, in fact, fairly uncivil: terrorist networks, \npaedophile rings and racist organisations enjoy the capacity to organise and mobilise outside \nstate control at least as much as Amnesty, Greenpeace and Jubilee 2000.6 Linked to this, \nsome elements of the public academic enterprise may be fairly unpleasant: Charles Murray\u2019s \nThe Bell Curve and Samuel Huntington\u2019s Who are We? communicated their ideas very \nsuccessfully to diverse publics, but neither could be considered in any way \u2018progressive\u2019.  \nIn many ways, the debates prompted by the move to public sociology are a return to \nthe arguments first mooted by Max Weber (in Gerth and Mills, 1991) nearly one hundred \nyears ago, most notably in his 1918 lecture, \u201cScience as a Vocation\u201d. Weber made the case \nfor demarcating between value-orientations and academic enquiry, or between adopting \npolitical positions and conducting scholarship. As such (1991:145-6),  \n \n \n5 \nTo take a political stand is one thing; to analyze political structures and party \npositions is another. When speaking in a political meeting about democracy, one does \nnot hide one\u2019s personal standpoint; indeed, to come out clearly and take a stand is \none\u2019s damned duty \u2026 It would be an outrage, however, to use words in this fashion in \na lecture or in the lecture-room ... the true teacher will beware of imposing from the \nplatform any political position upon the student, whether it is expressed or suggested. \n\u2018To let the facts speak for themselves\u2019 is the most unfair way of putting over a \npolitical position to the student.  \n \nFor Weber, although there is a relatively thin line between \u2018science\u2019 (academic enquiry) and \n\u2018politics\u2019 (activism, broadly conceived), the dutiful educator ensured that their role as an \nengaged citizen did not impede on their vocation as a scholar. In this sense, Weber is making \na crucial point \u2013 that academic research should be understandable, explicable and defendable \non a basis regardless of value orientation and subjective perspective. As such, although value \ncommitments can never be completely removed from the object of research, objectivity is \nmade plausible via the construction of ideal-typical forms of knowledge which mediate \nbetween normative engagements, conceptual frameworks and empirical situations (Jackson, \n2007). As such, Weber is suggesting that there are standards to which scholarly work must \nsubscribe (of research design, analytical validity, empirical veracity and the like) which can \nbe assessed without the need for shared ethical inclinations.  \nThe sense of a public academic enterprise being advocated here need not detract from \nthis sense of \u201cWeberian objectivity\u201d (Jackson, 2007). Indeed, it is worth emphasising the \nsense of autonomy which derives from such an understanding of professional academic \nresearch (Scott, 2005). Most academics enjoy a relative freedom over what they study, think \nand write which is drawn, at least in part, from the independence of the academy itself. It may \nbe that this dimension of speaking truth(s) to power isolates academics in fortified, \nsometimes cloistered, ivory towers, but it also offers them a sense of freedom which enriches \ncertain features of academic life. Advocates of public sociology do not deny this point. \nRather, they argue that the two principal strands of public sociology \u2013 traditional public \nsociology which frames matters of high public importance, and organic public sociology \nwhich is embedded in thick local publics \u2013 produce an essential dialogue which can act as a \nformative influence on the discipline and the academy as a whole. In a time of relative \nconsensus and conservatism \u2013 at least when it comes to questions about the management of \neconomies or the capacity of politics to radically reshape people\u2019s lives \u2013 public sociology \ngrounds and underpins professional and policy sociology, providing a sense of engagement \nwithout which the profession would have little meaning, slight moral authority and few \n \n6 \nconnections to the students and wider publics who are attracted both to the subject and its \nsubject matter. Public sociology, it is argued, forms an essential role in reconnecting \nprofessional sociology with the passion of public engagement, while at the same time \noffering a defence of civil society and progressive social movements which hardwires in a \nprotective umbilical cord between sociology as an academic pursuit and the various publics \nwithin which it is implanted and with which it shares a responsibility of engagement. This is \nnot about the reduction of all such academic enquiry to the level of either political punditry or \novert activism. Rather, it speaks to the heart of the scholarly vocation: the communication \nand critique of areas of knowledge which derive from value-commitments and yet which \nretain a focus on conceptual, analytical and empirical rigour (Jackson, 2007).  \n Certainly, the idea of public sociology appears to contain several attractive elements. \nFirst, it offers the chance to provincialize the Anglo-American academy in important ways \n(Quah, 2005), leading us to treat with caution claims based on the universalisation of \nparticular histories, contexts and cultures. Indeed, just opening the door to public sociology \nmeans recognising how sociology varies in form and content around the world \u2013 in countries \nsuch as Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, for example, there is almost nothing except public \nsociology (Baiocchi, 2005; Burawoy 2004b). Second, a public academic enterprise unites the \nworld of academic study with what Amitai Etzioni (2005) refers to as the era of \u2018popular \nmodernity\u2019 in which social movements, produced by increasingly dense state-society \npenetration, become the central outlet for political expression. As such, it offers insights into \nthe world of \u2018actually existing politics\u2019 which helps to keep research both grounded and \nmeaningful. Third, a public academic enterprise helps us move away from conceptual \nabstractions, for example the trinitarian division of state, society and market representing the \nfrontiers of politics, sociology and economics respectively, which can easily become reified \ninto analytical containers and, thereby, into ontological distinctions (Rosenberg, 1994). The \nhold of these concepts produces a bracketing off of particular areas of study and engenders a \nsense of hierarchy in which status is conferred on those seen to be looking at a discipline\u2019s \ncore, a move which is just as problematic within disciplines as between them. In IR, for \nexample, the fetishisation of anarchy, Westphalia, sovereignty, the balance of power and \nother such concepts has produced a disciplinary structure in which some areas of study are \nconsidered more central than others. These others are subsequently left to appear as cutting \nedge (at best) or as peripheral (at worst). Either way the result is the same \u2013 marginalisation.  \n \n \n \n7 \nTHREE PATHOLOGIES \n \nAlthough the debate surrounding public sociology is still very much being played out, it may \nbe that there are important lessons from these discussions which can be gleaned for IR. But \nwhy prefer a \u2018public\u2019 IR to any other means of re-affirming and re-imagining the discipline? \nAfter all, there is a broad sense of malaise about the capacity of the discipline to cope \neffectively with the vagaries of the post-Cold War world. Equally, there are no shortage of \nresponses about how to fill the gap between paradigms and practice, methods and substance, \ntheory and history. Of these, perhaps the three most prevalent are the call to make IR more \n\u2018policy relevant\u2019, the desire to extend IR\u2019s openness to other disciplines, and to seek a higher \npublic profile for the discipline. Before moving on to outlining the parameters of a public \nInternational Relations, therefore, it is worth clarifying how this particular project is distinct \nfrom these other responses \u2013 the valorisation of philosopher kings, the pursuit of \ninterdisciplinarity, and the development of IR-receptive public intellectuals. Although there \nmay be occasional overlaps between these three arenas and a public IR, the distances between \nthem both tease out the distinctiveness of public IR and illustrate \u2018three pathologies\u2019 that the \nenterprise would do well to avoid. \n \nPhilosopher kings? \n \nIt would be easy to see public IR as a venture closely associated with the world of the \nmandarin. After all, if academics want to be more relevant, grounded and meaningful, then \nwhat better way to do so than by influencing policy making? Also confusing this issue are the \nregular calls which deplore the increasing disconnection between policy making and the \nwider academy (Wallace, 1992; George, 1993; Walt, 2005). Where once, it is argued, a \ntransmission belt acted as a fluid carrier for the transfusion of academic ideas into policy, \nnow this process has become stilted and uneven. This shift has occurred for a number of \nreasons. First, the heightened professionalisation of the academic career. Tenure track in the \nUS, the RAE in the UK as well as numerous other processes have tended to generate a poppy \nfield syndrome of publishers, journals and institutions which homogenise what is considered \nto be high quality research. The result is the generation of private languages, fragmentation \nand factionalism (Abbott, 2001) in which academic tribes rarely venture out of their self-\ninsulated house-arrest.7 This process has produced a striking disengagement with \npolicymaking, particularly in the United States where the rise of game theory, an approach \n \n8 \nwhich relies on simulating perfect information, removing context and simplifying reality, has \nmade much academic work unsuited to a world of policy filled with complexity, \nindeterminacy and imperfection (Walt, 2005). \n Perhaps more important than professional disengagement, however, is the question of \nthe sharpness of the distinction between the two worlds occupied by academics and policy \nmakers. First, there is the question of time \u2013 while academics work in long-hand and in the \nlong-term, policy makers are concerned with the short-hand and the short-term.8 Stephen \nKrasner (2005), discussing his move from Stanford professor to Director for Policy Planning \nat the State Department, sees this as one of the most important distinctions between academia \nand policy making. Politicians simply do not have the time, even if they have the will, to \nread, analyse and engage in any detail with academic debates, let alone read the innumerable \npapers and books devoted to specialist topics. This is the world of the executive summary \nrunning up against the world of interminable throat clearing. Both suffer from their own \ntyranny: short-termism and the confinements of the politics of the possible for the policy \nmaker; the ivory tower and faddism for the academic.9  \nThe crucial point is that, even when policy makers and academics are working on the \nsame topic, their approaches to the issue are usually quite distinct. Hans Morgenthau \n(1970:14) understood this point well, \u2018the intellectual lives in a world that is separate from \nthat of the politician. The two worlds are separate because they are oriented towards different \nultimate values \u2026 truth threatens power, and power threatens truth\u2019. In reality, professional \npoliticians are surrounded by a protective belt of specialist advisers and public servants who \nact as filters on information, adopting explanations which fit with their policy prescriptions \nwhile ignoring those which appear to be contradictory. Indeed, as David Mosse (2004) \nargues, the ignorance of policy makers is structural rather than inadvertent. When \nintellectuals light up certain aspects of the policy making process via shorthands such as \nglobalisation, sustainability, soft power and the like, policy makers often fix policy around \nthese master themes. But when more inconvenient facts emerge \u2013 that democratisation is \ndangerous, or that terrorist networks cannot be fought as if they were sovereign states \u2013 then \nthese truths are less likely to feed into policy strategies. In this sense, the relationship \nbetween academia and policy making is contingent and tangential rather than necessarily \nclose \u2013 the production of expert knowledge is something of only instrumental interest to the \npracticing politician. In short, the first best world of speaking to truth(s) occupied by most \nacademics shares neither the same needs nor comparable notions of time as the second best \nworld of speaking to prudence occupied by most policy makers. \n \n9 \n Linked to this are the separate cultures within which academics and policy makers \noperate (George, 1993). While academics often seek to squeeze history and empirical \nevidence into their grand schemas, policy makers tend towards ad hoc judgements, carrying \nwith them a range of cultural practices ranging from cognitive dissonance to threat inflation \n(Jervis, 1976; Balzacq and Jervis, 2004), and a set of political constraints which are far more \ninfluential in their decisions than the advice of outside \u2018impartial\u2019 observers.10 As such, \nalthough academics may be able to help with background specialist information (such as \nregional expertise or issue area knowledge), or with the provision of analytical frameworks \n(such as the theory of nuclear deterrence, the democratic peace, or the conceptual apparatus \nprovided by globalisation), these are little more than loose maps within which the decision \nmaker is left to construct substantive policies (Nincic and Lepgold eds., 2000). In other \nwords, academics may be able to establish a context and range of possibilities within which \npolicy can be carried out. But the act of policy making itself is subject to all sorts of pressures \nand constraints (sometimes described, or derided, as \u2018the statesmen\u2019s lament\u2019) which take \nthem away from the \u2018purity\u2019 of the academic world. When this division of labour is not \nrecognised, when academics cross over into the world of the philosopher-king, dangerous \npolicies are often not very far behind, witnessed for example by democracy promotion, a set \nof policies rooted in a particular suite of academic ideas which have been elevated into a \nnumber of ideological and, at times, utopian political commitments (Lawson, 2008).  \n To be engaged in public academia, therefore, is not the same as making research more \npolicy oriented. In fact, the different worlds that policy makers and academics occupy is no \nbad thing. While academics have a duty, if they have one at all, to the pursuit of knowledge \nand, perhaps, to the defence of civil society, politicians and policy makers owe their fidelity \nto the state. As Steve Smith (1997:511) writes, \u2018if academics have failed to be involved in the \npolicy process, it has more to do with a failure to communicate with the public than with a \nfailure to communicate to government\u2019. Connections between these two spheres, when and \nwhere they are fruitful, should be occasional and organic. Indeed, just by carrying out their \nresearch, academics contribute to policy by framing problems, filling in necessary empirical \nand conceptual backgrounds, and by providing specialist forms of knowledge. Attempts at \nforcibly marrying the two worlds are likely both to end in failure and to weaken the other\u2019s \nautonomy. In order to function optimally, academics require a critical distance from the state. \nAs such, avoiding any necessary fusion between theory and policy \u2013 the \u2018siren song of policy \nrelevance\u2019 (Hill, 1994) \u2013 is a core feature of a public academic enterprise.  \n \n \n10 \nA necessary interdisciplinarity? \n \nThe second pathology to avoid is the notion of public International Relations as necessarily \ninvolving interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity is a term and a concept, which like \nInternational Relations itself, appears to have captured the zeitgeist. Given that so many \napproaches which speak to the contemporary imagination are trans-disciplinary (post-\nstructuralism and the broader cultural turn), joint-disciplinary (such as gender and ethnic \nstudies), multi-disciplinary (like area studies) or cross-disciplinary (for example, historical, \neconomic or political sociology), it is not surprising that there has been a call by both funding \nbodies and the wider academy to work beyond the confines of sometimes arbitrary and \nfrequently constraining disciplinary perimeters. This is a move made all the more urgent by \nthe non-disciplinary nature of many of the issues which most engage contemporary students \nand academics: religion, culture, terrorism, nationalism, globalisation, multiculturalism and \nso on. Indeed, one celebrated advocate of interdisciplinarity, Immanuel Wallerstein, has \nchaired a commission which made the case for recasting social science as \u2018pluralistic \nuniversalism\u2019, akin \u2018to the Indian pantheon, wherein a single god has many avators\u2019 \n(Gulbenkian Commission, 1996:59-60).  \n Wallerstein\u2019s (2004) vision of \u2018uni-disciplinarity\u2019 is intended as a return to a \nnineteenth century view of the social scientific enterprise, a time before disciplines sought the \nrelative autonomy and security which flowed from establishing discrete disciplinary edges. \nAs such, his call \u2013 for a renewed general engagement with the ambivalences of modernity \u2013 \ncertainly overlaps with some dimensions of a public academic enterprise. But for a myriad of \nreasons, conflating these two processes would be deleterious to the public academic \nenterprise. First there is the obvious, although still important, point that interdisciplinarity \nrequires disciplines in the first place (Moran, 2006); indeed, the latter provide a necessary \nprecondition for interdisciplinarity to take place at all. It is difficult to imagine a \u2018back to the \nfuture\u2019 in which disciplinary boundaries are dissolved. After all, they are reinforced by a \ncornucopia of surveillance mechanisms: professional organisations, academic journals, the \npeer review process, funding councils, assessments of research output and so on. This \ndisciplinary and professional separation is not necessarily a bad thing. Although awareness of \nwork in other disciplines is part of the lifeblood of the intellectual imagination, it is unlikely \nthat engagement with the primary turf of other disciplines can ever take place with the same \nlevels of depth or knowledge which specialists bring to a subject. Invariably, it seems, \ninterdisciplinarity entails an attraction to the mainstream of another subject, either delivering \n \n11 \nan off-the-shelf reading of a particular debate, or reading instrumentally about a certain issue \nin a way that precludes understanding of the more interesting terrain which lies beneath the \nsurface (Lawson, 2005a). As such, interdisciplinary researchers often lack the means to \narbitrate between rival specialist interpretations, a process Joseph Bryant (2006) describes as \n\u2018narrational discordance\u2019. One of the lessons of the last few years of international politics, \nboth for government and academics, is that specialist knowledge of an area, issue or language \n(such as the Middle East, Iraq or Arabic) generates a depth of understanding which no \ngeneralist can match. In this sense, it is worth recognising that the social sciences constitute a \nsingle family in which some relations, such as that between sociology and anthropology, are \nunnecessarily fractured, it is also worth remembering that other subjects are more distant \ncousins, often for sound reasons. Forms of specialist knowledge tend to take place away from \nthe surface level debates occupied by interdisciplinary researchers. But that does not make \nthese forms of expertise any less valuable. Just as General Practitioners do not conduct heart \nby-pass operations, hysterectomy\u2019s and neurological procedures, so matters of specialist \nimportance are likely to be beyond the purview of those engaged in interdisciplinary rock-\nskimming exercises. \n The issue of interdisciplinarity is a particularly acute one for International Relations. \nAs Barry Buzan and Richard Little (2001) point out, IR has a semi-permeable membrane \nwhich allows ideas from other disciplines in, but blocks substantive traffic out. As politics \nhas gone international, so researchers from outside IR have sought to occupy turf one might \nexpect the discipline to inhabit. Indeed, figures as diverse as Noam Chomsky, Niall Ferguson \nand Slavoj \u017di\u017eek have a far higher profile than those who inhabit the discipline of IR even on \nthose issues which speak to the heart of contemporary world politics: Iraq, war, the nature \nand extent of American power etc. As Buzan and Little argue, when the question is posed: \nwhat have other disciplines learned from IR, the cupboard is, \u2018if not quite bare, then certainly \nnot well stocked\u2019 (2001:20). Buzan and Little claim that this story of one-way traffic stems \nfrom IR\u2019s triple confinement behind a Eurocentric ahistoricism which isomorphises the \nWestphalian moment, a sectoral narrowness which privileges military and political power \nrelations, and an increasing fragmentation into house journals, styles and languages. As they \nwrite (2001:31), \u2018In the end, mainstream IR theory has preferred to think small and narrow \nrather than big and wide\u2019. If we accept this view of IR (and it does not seem very wide of the \nmark), then we can gauge a further weakness inherent in interdisciplinarity: its tendency to \ndissolve into cannibalism. Interdisciplinarity rarely works on a level playing field. More \noften, it works as a means for one discipline to colonise the turf of another. As such, border \n \n12 \nraids become akin to Viking raiding parties with booty carried off in one direction and little \nto show for it in the other. Indeed, these \u2018looting and pillaging raids\u2019 (Mann 1995:555) \nconjure up an image more akin to intellectual asset stripping than to fertile inter-relationship.  \n On the one hand, therefore, interdisciplinarity creates opportunities for what Bruce \nCarruthers (2005) calls \u2018constructive misbehaviour\u2019 \u2013 a chance for intellectual entrepreneurs \nto act as translators, borrowing concepts and data from one academic discipline and \nintroducing them into another.11 Such acts of arbitrage, when they are done well, can reduce \nlevels of \u2018intellectual autism\u2019 (Steinmetz 2005) \u2013 the narrowing of a field under the watchful \nscrutiny of academic homeland security agents. But it is important not to get too carried away \nwith openness and fluidity both within disciplines and between them. Interdisciplinarity can \nengender thinness and sloppiness as well as promote depth and rigour. Obscuring root-and-\nbranch differences can serve to make bridge-building enterprises a metaphor for hostile \ntakeovers, a means of amplifying small differences, or of generating intellectual dilettantism. \nPerhaps more importantly given the context of this essay, interdisciplinarity tends to focus on \nhorizontal connections between academic disciplines rather than fostering deeper vertical \nrelations with broader publics. As such, when the two processes link up, their relationship is \nlikely to be contingent rather than necessary. \n \nPublic intellectuals? \n \nThe third and final pathology which a public academic enterprise should avoid is that of the \ncult of the public intellectual. It is often argued that International Relations lacks the same \nlevel of public awareness that is enjoyed by cognate disciplines. This is both true and, at least \nto some extent, problematic. In a survey carried out in 2005 by the British magazine Prospect, \nonly one academic working in IR, Fred Halliday, made it into the magazine\u2019s list of 100 \nleading British public intellectuals. Across the Atlantic, Russell Jacoby (2000), Richard \nPosner (2002), Todd Gitlin (2006) and others have noted the general decline in significance \nfaced by public intellectuals in the United States, including those who work in and around IR. \nAlthough there are some countries \u2013 France, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa \u2013 where \nacademics cross easily into public life, the concern is that, at a time when the world has gone \nglobal and politics has gone international, the level of public unawareness in International \nRelations makes the subject home to wild conspiracy theories (9\/11 as a plot instituted by the \nUS government), and specious oversimplifications (the invasion of Iraq as a war for oil). As \nJohn Hall (2005:379) puts it, \u2018isolation from society is dangerous, the breeding ground not \n \n13 \njust for trivia but also for fantasies of place and power which occasionally have led to \ndreadful historical actions\u2019. \n However, it is questionable whether the answer to this shortcoming is the \ndevelopment and promotion of more IR-receptive public intellectuals. After all, public \nintellectuals, often operating at the edges of, or outside, the academy, tend to mirror the \nprocess carried out by those academics seeking to become more \u2018policy relevant\u2019 \u2013 providing \nsound-bites, in this case to the media rather than to policy audiences, about extremely \ncomplex issues. As such, they are engaged in an important communicative exercise, but not \none which shares any necessary resemblance to the idea of a public academic enterprise. \nIndeed, fairly often, public intellectuals are either engaged in issues well removed from \neveryday political action such as \u2018thin slicing\u2019 (Malcolm Gladwell), \u2018inflectional \nmorphology\u2019 (Steven Pinker) or \u2018the parallax view\u2019 (Slavoj \u017di\u017eek), or speak for a \u2018commons\u2019 \nwhich they have only rarely encountered (Jeffrey Sachs). To be clear \u2013 the point here is not \nthat publics are unable to understand, reflect and act upon complex messages. Indeed, some \npublic intellectuals \u2013 Jonathan Meades for example \u2013 communicate difficult concepts both \nclearly and effectively.12 Moreover, all sorts of dense academic texts \u2013 Hardt and Negri\u2019s \nEmpire for example \u2013 manage to cross over from the deepest reaches of academia into the \npublic domain. In fact, publics appear to be disengaged less by complexity than by the \ndetritus of academic life: unnecessary jargon, interminable navel gazing, narcissistic point-\nscoring and the like.13 Perhaps academics should write two versions of every book: one for an \nacademic audience; the other a more overtly publicly oriented tract. However, as Stephen \nChan (2007) notes, there is an additional problem in that the three models of the public \nintellectual \u2013 as high priests of the royal court (Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, \nCondoleezza Rice), as ersatz emancipators from prevalent power structures (V\u00e1clav Havel, \nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas), or as activist detectives conducting investigations into the ruinous policies \nof \u2018one\u2019s own side\u2019 (Noam Chomsky, John Pilger) \u2013 all fail to engage formatively with the \nworld beyond and outside the West. As such, they are offering a stilted picture of the world \nconcerned with what \u2018we\u2019 can do either to or for \u2018them\u2019. Either way, this is a symptom of \nclosure rather than a process of openness, a form of quarantine which seeks to proclaim \n\u2018truth\u2019 from on-high rather than to build \u2018truths\u2019 from genuine forms of complex solidarity.  \n If the central point of a more publicly oriented academic enterprise is the fostering of \nties with multiple publics, this is unlikely to be resolved by the emergence of a new \ngeneration of media savvy IR public intellectuals. These individuals tend to occupy a terrain \nsome way removed from the level of grounded research demanded by public IR, writing \n \n14 \naccessible tracts which sell books, magazines and newspapers but which only tangentially \nbare a resemblance to the type of research which serves as the leitmotif of a public academic \nengagement. While the central component of a public academic enterprise is engagement \nwith multiple publics, public intellectuals tend to be populist advocates from \u2018on high\u2019. As \nsuch, although these two worlds may touch on occasion, any such overlap is likely to be both \nrestricted and partial. \n \n \nFOR A PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS \n \nIf the last section was concerned with what public International Relations is not, this part of \nthe essay begins to lay out more constructive foundations for the enterprise. The central \ntheme underpinning this section, and the drive towards public IR in general, is what Stephen \nChan (2003, 2007) calls \u2018complex commonality\u2019. Chan\u2019s work on narratology seeks to reveal \nthe inter-subjective \u2018trans-intellectual histories\u2019 that can act as a dialogue between peoples \nand places. In this essay, I treat the idea of complex commonality as an attempt to mediate \nbetween particular and universal, understanding that local variations in culture, normative \nframeworks and experiences across time and space preclude simple universalities, but that \nthis need not entail a valorisation of minor differences. Rather, immersion in various \nhistory\u2019s, cultures, normative frameworks and discourses can direct us towards \ncommonalities which, in turn, act as building blocks towards shared normative and political \nprojects. The unevenness of everyday experiences of global structures \u2013 capitalism, \npatriarchy, the states-system and so on \u2013 requires neither a flattening of world politics into a \ntoneless homogeneity nor a revelling in simplistic heterogeneity. Indeed, beyond the binary \npresented by the bludgeon of homogeneity and the kaleidoscope of heterogeneity lies a more \ncomplex, intricate story about our global past, present and future. Public IR should be \nconcerned with weaving together this shared narrative into intelligible, if dynamic, \ncommonalities, performing a task close to what Craig Calhoun (2003) calls \n\u2018communitarianism in cosmopolitanism\u2019 or what Seyla Benhabib (2002) refers to as \n\u2018pluralistically enlightened universalism\u2019 \u2013 the study of distinct history\u2019s, languages, \nepistemologies and ways of life in order to generate complex forms of cosmopolitan \nengagement. This section seeks to fill in this broad rubric via a discussion of the research, \nteaching, theory, methods, and communicative openings suggested by a public IR. \n \n \n15 \nGrounded research \u2026 and teaching \n \nThe first demand of public IR is that it produces, and is produced by, grounded research. In \nshort, this means less time in the ivory-tower and more time engaging with the multiple \npublics that make up the panorama of world politics. This does not mean the conjuring of a \nsingle global demos, whether this be derived from the twin altars of the Washington \nConsensus or global civil society. After all, there are precious few signs of an emerging \nglobal demos, and publics around the world seem ill-disposed to issues, threats and \nchallenges beyond their immediate borders (Halliday 2004). Rather, in a world in which \neveryday politics is becoming increasingly internationalised, and in which the international is \nbecoming a subsequently thick political space, any engagement with multiple publics must by \ndefinition be international. In this sense, Michael Burawoy (2005a) is right that \u2018third wave\u2019 \npublic sociology has seen a shift to the international sphere. As such, engagement within the \nmultiple publics which make up international politics is a necessary feature of any \ncontemporary public academic enterprise. It follows that it must also be the central thrust of \npublic IR.  \n The key point is that the direction of this engagement is not just one-way, from grand \ntheory, universal abstractions and methodological strictures to the everyday world of \ninternational politics, but one which allows a genuinely two-way interaction between \nresearcher and subject to flow. While this presents its own difficulties \u2013 defining the nature, \nscope and limits of \u2018international publics\u2019, taking on the time and expense of engagement \nwith these publics, and allowing publics to speak not just in bit parts but as central actors \u2013 \nthe establishment of this dialogic space between academic IR research and the stuff of \ninternational politics is the sine qua non of public IR. Some examples of this form of research \nare already in evidence \u2013 Stephen Hopgood\u2019s (2006) work on Amnesty International, the \nresearch on globalisation and resistance by Louise Amoore (2002), Anna Stavrianakis\u2019 \n(2006) study of the links between universities and the arms industry, and Patrick Bond\u2019s \n(2003, 2005) conjoining of academic, political and normative engagements over issues of \nbasic needs in Southern Africa serve as useful cases in point. But these are exceptions rather \nthan the rule \u2013 the majority of IR research remains conducted at a relative remove from the \nevents, processes and groups which make up everyday international politics. As such, there is \na substantial gap to fill in terms of this form of research.  \n There are some rudiments of an engagement with \u2018everyday\u2019 world politics on which \na public IR enterprise could be linked. Pace figures such as Michel de Certeau (1988), Henri \n \n16 \nLefebvre (1991), and Erving Goffman (1959), some scholars (for example, Hobson and \nSeabrooke eds., 2007) are concentrating less on the 10% of the world which represents the \nexposed tip of world politics than the 90% which lies beneath the surface (T\u00e9trault and \nLipshutz, 2005). This may seem an obvious point. After all, precious few political scientists \nwould study democracy merely by voting \u2013 all 72 minutes of it that one scholar, Paul \nGinsborg (2005), calculates that voters in democracies spend at the ballot box during their \nlifetimes. And yet, asking questions about \u2018who acts\u2019 rather than \u2018who governs\u2019 (Hobson and \nSeabrooke eds., 2007) presents a very different agenda than is normally taken up in IR or \nIPE. Indeed, inverting the iceberg generates a focus on \u2018the art of the weak\u2019 (Goffman, 1959): \nthe subtle and common ways in which everyday acts of subversion and resistance \u2013 verbal \ntaunts, subversive stories, rumour and innuendo \u2013 are used around the world (Kerkvliet, \n2005). Beyond this aspect of everyday world politics are more dramatic processes, for \nexample the ways in which anti-colonial movements take on the language, norms and \nstrategies of colonial powers in order to reveal the contradictions present in metropolitan \ndiscourse and action. This process of \u2018symbolic ju-jitsu\u2019 (Scott, 1987) is present in both the \n\u2018mimetic challenge\u2019 (Bhabha, 1990) presented by third world revolutionaries and the \ndystopian visions of Osama Bin Laden and his followers (Lawrence, 2005). As such, it serves \nas a useful way into areas of study which IR often either fails to fully recognise or seeks to \nco-opt into pre-existing frameworks. \n A focus on \u2018everyday\u2019 world politics, already a staple of fields such as post-colonial \nstudies (Darby, 2004; Dutton, 1998), carries the prospect of opening up fertile turf in \ninternational studies, most notably in its capacity to weave together a number of apparently \ndisparate trends in the discipline, not least the turn towards the individual subject in \nnormative IR (as witnessed by the increasing attention paid to human security issues, the \nemergence of the International Criminal Court, or the burgeoning focus on liberal human \nrights) and a renewed interest in notions of international community and society (see, for \nexample Barry Buzan\u2019s (2004) articulation of interhuman relations as a \u2018first order society\u2019). \nTo take a more concrete example, Arlene Tickner\u2019s (2003) work on distinguishing a \nparticularly Latin American IR scholarship reveals a number of intriguing points: that such \nscholarship tends to neglect hard-and-fast distinctions between international and domestic \npolitics, unsurprising perhaps given the manifold ways in which external forces have affected \ndomestic politics in Latin America; that there is a close relationship between theory and \npractice in Latin American IR, most notable in the elevation of academics to key political \nposts; and a lack of attention, again perhaps unsurprsingly, to issues of anarchy. Few theorists \n \n17 \nin non-metropolitan parts of the world claim to see anarchy rather than hierarchy \u2013 whether \nhegemonic or imperial \u2013 when they look out of the window.  \n These examples, although hardly widespread and certainly primarily immanent, do \nprovide a sense of the ways in which a public International Relations enterprise could provide \nsome added value to the discipline. Importantly, the need to establish two-way dialogues \nbetween scholars and the publics which constitute everyday world politics is not one \nrestricted to research. It is also an important feature of teaching International Relations. The \nincreasing popularity of IR around the world is fairly straightforward to understand. As \npolitics has gone international, so students are becoming increasingly tuned in, both \npolitically and normatively, to what they understand to be the subject matter of IR: human \nrights, terrorism, environmental issue, ethnic conflict, war, migration, globalisation and so on. \nYet frequently, rather than using these engagements as a means of affecting and reflecting \nupon our teaching, we see them as diversions to be socialised into the discipline, to be given a \n\u2018proper\u2019 framework, to be mapped onto existing problem fields and paradigms (Shaw and \nWalker, 2006; Eschle and Maiguashca, 2006). As such, IR as a discipline is not only missing \nout from a research-led engagement with international publics, it is also failing to develop its \nteaching in response to the ways in which students are brought into the subject. All too often, \nreforming courses becomes the addition of an extra week on \u2018new security threats\u2019, the \nquestion of how well Iraq conforms to the \u2018just war tradition\u2019, or how closely American \npreponderance corresponds to the predictions of balance of power theory rather than an \nexercise in how well, and to what extent, the discipline understands the novel ways in which \nstudents conceptualise and engage with international politics. As such, a central task of public \nIR is working out ways in which teaching, as well as research, can build from rather than on \nthe interests of students attracted to the discipline.  \n \nAction guiding theory \n \nA second, and linked, component of public IR is the provision of what Chris Brown (2006) \n(pace Stephen White) calls \u2018action guiding theory\u2019.  Over recent years, IR theory has become \nan industry in its own right \u2013 indeed one which has outgrown any soubriquet of \u2018cottage\u2019. In \nmany ways, this is a progressive step \u2013 a more philosophically rigorous enterprise is \nproductive in its own right and can provide firmer foundations for empirical research. And \nyet, all too often, the search for more theory has led to three barren wastelands: the desire to \nretain scientific credentials which continue to provide a narrow, overly rigid, sense of \n \n18 \nhierarchy within the discipline; a case of philosophical overstretch in which old debates are \nreinvented apparently ad infinitum;14 and a failure to engage substantively with the substance \nof world politics itself. In general terms, IR theory has become \u2018the new black\u2019 (Brown, \n2006). Meta-theoretical debates, the turn to Schmitt, Lakatos and others, and a general rise in \nmethodological awareness are all important dimensions in the opening of IR as a field of \nstudy. But to some extent this turn has taken place with a sense of remove from, and \noccasionally distrust towards, the actual stuff of world politics, providing a tyranny of \nmethod over substance which does a disservice to both enterprises. \n Public IR, while understanding the need for professionalism and depth in IR theory, \ntakes the enterprise as a means rather than as an end. In other words, theory serves as a means \nto deepen, broaden and contextualise action-led research rather than operating as an end \nwhich subverts the need for empirical research. In this sense, while all IR students and \nscholars should be aware of broader issues of philosophy and political theory, these areas \nshould not be fetishized or granted a status above that of hands-on research. In a similar vein, \nthe status of star-gazing methodological technicians, particularly in the United States, is of \nmuch less utility to public IR than an understanding of what Adam Przeworksi (1996) calls \n\u2018methodological opportunism\u2019 \u2013 the idea of a research strategy drawn from a particular \npuzzle or engagement with a substantive field of enquiry. Neither theory nor methods should \nbe imposed on particular subject areas. Nor should they be seen as zero-sum specialisms \nwhich remove the need for substantive research. For its part, public IR should eschew any \nsuch trade-off, making a concerted engagement with political and normative issues the \nstarting point of its research. Occupying the \u2018the eclectic messy centre\u2019 (Evans 1996) of \ndebates about theory and methods generates a research process which is premised in the first \ninstance upon empirical, political and normative engagements with the events, issues and \nprocesses which make up the marrow of world politics itself. \n Public IR, therefore, is primarily envisaged as occupying turf around middle range \ntheory, embracing complexity, contingency, and context but also examining the ways in \nwhich particular experiences conjoin with wider processes across time and place. As a result, \npublic IR tends towards ethnography (e.g. Vaughan, 2005), analytical history (e.g. Hall, \n2005), and multiple levels of analysis (e.g. Sartori, 1970) in the generation of conditional \ngeneralisations rooted in time and place specificities. If the world is messy, complex and at \ntimes, contradictory, then research which finds common patterns, trends and trajectories from \nempirical analysis rather than one which seeks to impose monolithic order on historical \nambiguities is likely to yield a far richer picture. As such, public IR is rooted in the \n \n19 \nsubstantive application of social relations as they are constituted in time and place, followed \nby the examination of how far these social processes and social facts are generalisable across \nboth time and space. This brings it into contact with a number of fields of research already \nprevalent in IR, most notably historical sociology (Lawson, 2006, 2007), which also carry out \nthis type of research. Practical examples on which to build include exploration of how time \nand space differentiation impacts on general abstractions such as empire (Lieven, 2001; \nMann, 2003) and revolution (Halliday, 1999; Lawson, 2005b).  \n \nA double engagement \n \nA third dimension of public IR is its concern with normative, politically engaged work. Those \nworking in the field of public IR should recognise that facts are value laden, but that values \ntoo are factually embedded. As Heikki Patom\u00e4ki and Colin Wight (2000) observe, this leads \nto a simple desire to make values factually explained, and facts subject to critical evaluation. \nThe result is a connection, or perhaps a reconnection, between the world of ethical \ndeliberation and the world of causal processes far removed from the banalities of \u2018value-free\u2019 \nabstract research programmes, \u2018orphans of the scientific revolution\u2019 (Puchala, 2003) as they \nare. In this sense, public IR critiques the way in which much of the contemporary academy, \nboth in IR and beyond, endorses a bureaucratic enterprise which restricts the intellectual \nimagination, factors out the passion inherent in political contestation, and limits academic \nresearch to being an executive arm of the state apparatus. The narrowing of work behind the \nwalls of what is considered to denote a professional academic discipline has served to blind \nscholars and students to the importance of this double engagement \u2013 both political and \nintellectual \u2013 with the essence of world politics. The \u2018objectification\u2019 of research, part of the \nlifeblood of positivism, has hidden the overt, normative engagement with research and \npolitics which was once the cornerstone of classical social science, and which lies at the heart \nof most public and student engagement with academic enquiry today. A task for public IR is \nto restore a sense of humanism to the discipline, and in the process, to unite the world of \nhuman agency with the apparently impersonal structural forces, and professional blinkers, \nwhich serve to constrain research in the field. Public IR aims to take human relations and \ntheir crystallisation in historical conditions as its primary area of interest. As such, it promises \nthe study, articulation and representation of \u2018we\u2019 rather than \u2018they\u2019, or \u2018it\u2019. \n Public IR, therefore, as well as being concerned with the extent to which notions of \nvalue rationality, axiomatic rationality or bounded rationality serve as useful additions to \n \n20 \ninstrumentality as the building block for IR research, should also take an interest in what is \nmissing from this debate \u2013 the world of \u2018unreason\u2019. The politics of \u2018unreason\u2019 ranges from \nempathy (as distinct from sympathy) with the articulation of alternative understandings of \n\u2018the international\u2019, to concern with the beliefs and emotions \u2013 anger, fear, love \u2013 which \nconstitute a politics of commitment. These stimulations to action lie at the heart of \ninternational politics \u2013 the motivations of suicide bombers, or those who take part in ethnic \ncleansing and revolutionary movements \u2013 and yet which seem to have little in common with \nthe world of instrumental reason. IR still seems caught in a state of myopia towards the \nnumerous psychological research over the last thirty years which has explored the ways in \nwhich rationality is, in fact, dependent on psychological states such as emotions. As Jonathan \nMercer argues (2005:94), \u2018emotion precedes choice (by ranking one\u2019s preferences), emotion \ninfluences choice (because it directs one\u2019s attention and is the source of action), and emotion \nfollows choice (which determines how one feels about one\u2019s choice and influences one\u2019s \npreferences)\u2019. Hence, psychological states should be seen less as a means of explaining non-\nrational mistakes, but more as something deeply woven into the fabric of rationality itself. By \ndraining psychology from rationality, Mercer argues, rational choice approaches collapse into \nnormative ceteris paribus statements which rely, unwittingly and without acknowledgement, \non what he calls \u2018folk psychology\u2019. And as Tarak Barkawi (2004, 2007) makes clear, \nremoving emotions from political choices and imposing \u2018our\u2019 views on \u2018the other\u2019 of \ninternational politics is unlikely to achieve either understanding or explanation of why, for \nexample, young Muslims are willing to lay down their lives for the cause of jihadism. \nDifficult though this may be, grass roots knowledge, specialist understanding and immersion \nin the everyday world of international politics help to provide a decoding which, in turn, \nshould yield results which go much deeper than abstracting motives from others which they \ndo not appear to hold for themselves.  \n \nMultiple channels of communication \n \nThe fourth and final dimension of public IR is to think much more fluidly about the multiple \nways in which IR is communicated. Rather than endorsing the homogenisation of what is \nconsidered to be the \u2018proper\u2019 means of communicating scholarship via niche journals, \nuniversity presses and other forms of regulated texts, a public IR would be much more open \nto how communication both with and between international publics and professional \nresearchers takes place. Public discourse carried out via blogs (such as \n \n21 \nhttp:\/\/duckofminerva.blogspot.com\/), e-zines (such as www.opendemocracy.net), online \nnetworks (such as global exchange), talks, reports, magazines and other non-peer reviewed \npublications provide relatively open channels of communication, translation and \u2018back \ntranslation\u2019 (Buroway, 2005c) which can help to foster a sense of two-way communication \nbetween public and academy.  It might also be worth considering the important ways in \nwhich visual forms of communication could play a greater role in the discipline, for example \nby exploring more explicit links between visual cultures and IR. The politics department at \nGoldsmiths, University of London, has recently become home to an artist in residence who is \nworking on multiple projects which open up non-textual dimensions to learning, thinking \nabout and researching international politics. The department has begun to introduce non-\ntextual assessments for its students \u2013 including videos and other forms of artwork \u2013 in an \nattempt to demonstrate how international politics is constituted by day-to-day visual \ninteractions as well as by more formalised textual communications. Importantly, these means \nof transmission move away from a mono-directional imparting of knowledge towards a \nmutual exchange of views, opening a much wider sense of the world of international relations \nthan is conjured by the discipline to date.  \n Of course, the prospects of these forms of communication run into immediate \nobstacles, not least how forms of unconventional intellectual exchange impact on \nprofessional processes such as tenure review. It may or may not be the case that scholars such \nas Juan Cole and Dan Drezner have been rejected for tenure at high-profile universities (Yale \nand Chicago respectively) because of their blogs, but regardless, it is clear that taking an \novert normative stance on a particular issue, or using an alternative forum for displaying \nthese views, is not yet something academic institutions find easy to grasp. Nor does academic \nactivism necessarily translate into successful political interventions. For example, the attempt \nat \u201cWeberian activism\u201d (Jackson and Kaufman, 2007) instituted by \u2018Security Scholars for a \nSensible Foreign Policy\u2019 did not make the substantive public impact over the war in Iraq that \nits signatories envisioned, a failure shared by many other such ventures over previous years \nand decades. And yet, there are increasing instances in which interventions via \nunconventional \u2018fifth estate\u2019 media are infiltrating mainstream politics, whether this be over \nthe resignation of Trent Lott or the outing of Valerie Plame (Drezner and Farrell, 2004). Over \ntime, it may be that such forms of engagement will help to recast traditional sites of academic \ngatekeeping (Drezner, 2006). What is clear is that opening up processes of communicative \nexchange are bound up with deeper social trends \u2013 not least debates about partisanship in the \nmedia \u2013 which are only just beginning to take place.  \n \n22 \n \n \nTHE DUAL MANDATE \n \nPublic International Relations is not intended to be a new master-category for the discipline. \nRather, this essay has sought to open up a space for public IR within the glasnost currently \ngripping the discipline. It has outlined an enterprise based on complex commonality, \ngrounded research, action guiding theory, political and normative engagement, and multiple \nchannels of communication. Clearly, given the relatively youthfulness of this form of \nresearch, this essay has only been able to provide the bare bones of what a more pronounced \nengagement with public IR would involve. As such, it is an opening \u2013 or suggestion \u2013 for \nfurther debate; researchers will have to decide for themselves \u2018how far along the action chain\u2019 \n(Etzioni, 2005) of public IR they are prepared to go. The key point is to visualise public IR as \npart of the broader fabric of the discipline rather than as a subaltern option to be seen as \nsecond tier, private or marginal. It may be that relatively few students and scholars choose \nmore than a taste from its menu. After all, as noted above, public International Relations runs \ncounter to numerous trends within the discipline \u2013 how status is conferred, the tendency to \nfactionalism, and the shortage of time, funds and interest in grass roots research. \nNevertheless, public International Relations has potentially important benefits for the \ndiscipline as a whole, not least in the ways it can help to reconnect the subject to its students \nand to the subject matter of the rapidly changing world within which the discipline is \nembedded, and yet which it often seems content to ignore.  \n In general, public International Relations represents a step away from cloistered \nscholasticism towards a more concerted engagement with the multiple publics which \nconstitute everyday world politics. As such, public IR looks outwards rather than inwards, to \ncomplexity rather than parsimony, and to concrete research rather than meta-abstractions. \nPerhaps it is a curse for the current generation of IR scholars and students to live in \ninteresting times, a world of rapid, turbulent and often unsettling changes. But it would be a \nfar greater curse if this time was spent on protracted bouts of navel gazing and on attempts to \nrescue and revive outdated approaches, paradigms and worldviews, only coming up for air to \nfind that the world has moved on. In this sense, public IR joins part of a wider opening in the \nsocial sciences represented by the Perestroika movement in Political Science, the shift \ntowards a post-autistic economics, the move towards public sociology outlined earlier in this \nessay, as well as the return of a closer relationship between academic work and political \n \n23 \nactivism as represented by the Caucus for a New Political Science in the United States and \nthe Network of Activist Scholars of Politics and International Relations in the UK (Herring, \n2006). These openings signal at least a partial return to what Earl Rubington and Martin \nWeinberg (2003:361) call the dual mandate, an academic vocation intended \u2018to solve social \nproblems as well as to develop disciplines\u2019. Rubington and Weinberg see sociologists as \nplaying four roles: \u2018theorist, researcher, applier, and critic\u2019. Until recently, IR has seemed \ninfatuated with just the first of these, with perhaps a side order of the second. In a time of \nboth great opportunity, and also great challenges, for IR, it is time to cast the net wider and to \nseek a more consolidated engagement with the third and fourth of these challenges, in the \nprocess opening up dialogue with the multiple publics which constitute world politics. \n \n24 \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \n \nAbbott, Andrew.

Paul Kirby, Patrick Jackson, Bryan Mabee and Faiz \nAbuani provided excellent comments on earlier drafts of the piece as did two anonymous IPS \nreviewers. Primary thanks must go to the students of the BA and MA programmes in \nInternational Studies at Goldsmiths. I\u2019m not sure how far along the action chain of public IR \nmany students went \u2013 or will go in the future \u2013 but if there were doubts, these were rarely \nmade public. For that I am extremely grateful.  \n2 For example, the maverick British politician George Galloway referred to the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union as the \u2018single biggest catastrophe of my life\u2019. Hattenstone, Simon. \nSeptember 16, 2002. Saddam and Me: Interview with George Galloway. The Guardian.  \n3 I am not seeking to make the point that these exceptions serve as examples of public IR. To \nthe contrary, my point is that these publications are amongst the best attempts to deal with the \nmultiple openings of post-Cold War IR without recasting the enterprise in any kind of \n\u2018public\u2019 fashion.  \n4 Mearsheimer and Walt argue that the Israeli lobby, an informal alliance of public and \nprivate groups and individuals, exercises adverse influence over US foreign policy via a \nmixture of political pressure, media manipulation and through silencing academic debate. \nWhether or not readers agree with these conclusions, the analysis provided by Mearsheimer \nand Walt hardly appears to be a recognisably realist argument, whether classical, structural or \nneo-classical. For a rebuttal of Mearsheimer and Walt\u2019s argument, see Dershowitz (2006). \n5 The extent to which systemic level theories fail by necessity to capture reality is a point \nmade well by Michael Mann (2006:344): \u2018there is no singular world system, no singular \nprocess of globalisation, no multi-state system dominated by a singular realist logic. History \nis not the history of class struggles or of modes of production, or of epistemes or discursive \nformations, cultural codes or underlying structures of thought governing the language, values, \nscience and practices of an era, underpinned by a singular process of power enveloping all \nhuman activity. These system theories succeed in capturing theorists, not social reality\u2019. \n6 This issue is even more thorny when elevated to the international realm. Beyond the \nquestion of where one can locate \u2018global publics\u2019, it is difficult to imagine any such sphere \nwithout understanding the central part played by states in forming an international public \nspace (Colas, 2002). Contemporary transnational social movements pale in comparison to \ntheir nineteenth and twentieth century forbearers \u2013 whether socialist, feminist, or \nrevolutionary \u2013 in their capacity to transgress borders. And states, whether rightly or wrongly, \ncontinue to be the principal sites of representation and accountability in international politics, \nsomething many activists seem to acknowledge by their extensive lobbying of influential \nstate actors, often acting as advocacy networks which speak for rather than with the publics \nthey purport to represent (Chandler, 2004a). Indeed, this \u2018courtier politics\u2019 is, to some extent \nat least, rooted in a refusal to engage with collective progressive struggles in favour of an \nagent-less, individualist ethics which sees the international, or global, sphere as a release \nfrom the attenuation of political contestation in the West (Chandler, 2004b). \n7 This process has been intensified by a considerable growth in niche journals. The \nInternational Studies Association now produces five official journals aimed at what are \nconsidered to be distinct audiences within the discipline, while a growing number of journals \nare geared for specialist fields, hence the recent emergence of the Journal of Intervention and \n \n32 \n                                                                                                                                                        \nState Building, and perhaps more strikingly, Translocations: The Irish Migration, Race and \nSocial Transformation Review. Linked to this are the emergence of ever increasing specialist \ngroups within professional organisations. The International Studies Association now has \ntwenty-three discrete sections, while the British International Studies Association has fifteen \naffiliated working groups, many of which have appeared only in the last few years.  \n8 If, as Schopenhauer thought, current events are \u2018the second hands of history\u2019, then policy \nmakers work in seconds while academics, in contrast, tend to operate for some of the time in \nminutes, more frequently in hours, and on occasion in days. \n9 Edward Said writes forcefully on the tendency of western academics to embrace faddism: \n\u2018cults like post-modernism, discourse analysis, New Historicism, deconstruction, and neo-\npragmatism transport academics into the country of the blue; an astonishing sense of \nweightlessness with regard to the gravity of history and individual responsibility fritters away \nattention to public matters, and to public discourse \u2026 Western intellectuals choose \ntheoretical positions with about the same effort and commitment required in choosing items \nfrom a menu\u2019. In Chan (2007:1). \n10 Often these processes generate their own pathologies. As Philip Tetlock (2005) points out, \nspecialists are actually less good at predicting events in their field as non-experts, having a \ntendency to over-extrapolate from the past to the future. This is, in many ways, unsurprising. \nAfter all, experts are not neutral observers but partisans who have a vested interest in \nexplaining and predicting a certain chain of events. As such, they have an in-built tendency \ntowards motivated bias and groupthink, a point well made thirty years ago by Robert Jervis \n(1976) and more recently by Michael Freeden (2003). \n11 Illustrative examples of fruitful interdisciplinarity include the concept of \u2018punctuated \nequilibrium\u2019, first mooted by the biologist Stephen Jay Gould to describe the switch-points in \nwhich long periods of stable reproduction within complex systems are punctuated by short, \nperiods of rapid change. Gould\u2019s concept has been usefully transported into numerous \u2018soft\u2019 \nacademic sciences. Another pertinent example is the concept of \u2018path dependence\u2019 which \noriginated in economic history and has become used in many disciplines to describe how \nsmall initial distinctions are amplified over time, becoming substantial schisms which are \nthen difficult to reverse. \n12 The series on British television which Meades fronted on the architecture of the Third \nReich and Soviet Russia is illustrative of the ways in which complex ideas can be translated \u2013 \noften through humour \u2013 without sacrificing intellectual content.  \n13 I am grateful to Paul Kirby for stressing this point to me. \n14 For example, much of the debate about theory in IR is a rehash of a much older division \nbetween the Austrian School and the German Historical School over scientific method: the \nMethodenstreit. The German Historical School argued that, rather than focusing on universal \ntruisms modelled on homo economicus, the line which was pursued by the Austrian School of \nclassical economists, economic processes operated within a social framework which was in \nturn shaped by cultural and historical forces. Hence, Gustav Schmoller and his associates \nfavoured historical, comparative research that could uncover the distinctive properties of \nparticular economic systems. The core debates of the original Methodenstreit continue to \nreverberate around contemporary social science and, in particular, IR: the degree to which \npeople\u2019s actions are shaped by their social, historical and normative contexts as opposed to \nthe view of individuals as universally driven homo politicus or homo economicus; preferences \nas exogenously generated by social institutions or the endogenous result of primal drives; \nrationality as a broad category embracing a range of motivations versus rationality as a \nnarrow, limited realm of utility maximisation. \n"}
