INTRODUCTION\nAspergillus section Flavi is the major group of fungi associated with aflatoxin\ncontamination in several agricultural commodities. Three species of this section are\nknown to produce aflatoxins (AFs): A. flavus, A. parasiticus and A. nomius, with the\nfirst two important in the colonisation of crops such as maize, peanuts and nuts\n3(Payne, 1998). They are spread in hot and dry geographic areas where they are\noften able to colonise and contaminate crops rapidly.\nIn 2003, for the first time, high aflatoxin contamination, above the European\nlegal limits both in maize kernels (20 \uf06dg kg-1 and 5 \uf06dg kg-1 for feed and food,\nrespectively) and in milk (0.05 \uf06dg kg-1), were found Italy and it was signalled as an\nemerging problem in Europe (Piva et al., ). This was due to the extremely hot and dry\nweather conditions registered in Italy during summer, very conducive for AFs\ncontamination (Payne, 1998; Klich et al., 1994).\nA. flavus overwinters in soil on crop debris and this represents the main\nsource of primary inoculum for maize plant. Conidia are dispersed aerially and\ndeposited on corn ears enabling germination and infection to be initiated.. The maize\ngrowth stage most susceptible to infection is early browing (Payne, 1992), that\nhappens in late June-early July in Italy, with high temperatures, frequently higher\nthan 30\u00b0C. The two major factors that influence soil populations of this fungus are soil\ntemperature and moisture (Payne, 1998). Tolerance of both \u03a8s and \u03a8m stress are \nimportant for survival and for growth to occur in crop debris and in soil (Magan,\n1988). Solute stress is imposed by ionic changes due to salt, and non-ionically due to\nwater binding by components on crop residue or plant parts. Matric stress is due to\nwater adsorption and surface tension phenomena in soil; it causes restricted solute\ntransport and it limits growth responses. Growth variations in solute or matric stress\nconditions can also be due to nutritional imbalances, specific ion effects or to the\ndecreased water content that restrict solute transport (Adebayo & Harris, 1971).\nA. flavus can grow between 12 and 48\u00b0C and at water potentials (\u03a8t) as low \nas \u2013 35 MPa (Klich et al., 1994). Available water in maize debris was reported as\nvariable between 0.40 and 0.83 during summer in Italy (Rossi et al., 2008).\n4Interactions between \u03a8t stress and temperature are fundamental because they\nrepresent the two-dimensional niche in which fungi may be able to effectively\ngerminate, grow and actively compete for the allocation of the available resources\n(Marin et al., 1998).\nSome studies have been conducted on the biology of A. flavus to determine\nfavourable ecological parameters able to promote growth, especially in the USA\n(Kheiralla et al., 1992; Truckless et al., 1988). They showed that 25-30\u00b0C were\noptimal for growth of A. Section flavi strains (Giorni et al., 2007; Kheiralla et al., 1992;\nNesci et al., 2004; Sanchis & Magan, 2004). However, only one paper has compared\nthe effect of \u03a8s and \u03a8m stress on growth of A. flavus strains (Nesci et al., 2004) and\nnone on sporulation.\nInterestingly, it has been suggested by Calvo et al. (2002) that sporulation capacity\nand secondary metabolite production by A. flavus and A. nidulans are linked by the\nsame induction pathways and influenced by environmental factors. They have\nprovided information on this with regard to pH, temperature and carbon\/nitrogen\nsources, but no studies have been conducted considering solute or matric stress.\nThe objective of this study was to obtain information on the capacity of three\naflatoxigenic A. flavus strains collected in northern Italy, to grow and sporulate under\ndifferent interacting \u03a8s\/\u03a8m stress and temperature combinations.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Fungal strains and media preparation\nThree A. flavus strains (MPVP A 2052, A 2073 and A 2092) stored in the\nfungal collection of the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Institute of Entomology\nand Plant Pathology, isolated from maize grown in Italy, previously characterised as\n5able to produce AFB1 and AFB2,, were used. They were selected to represent the\nwhole population collected; they belong to the three clusters drawn with all strains\ncharacteristics (Giorni et al., 2007).\nThe medium was a maize-based agar with 3% maize flour and 2% agar with\n\u03a8t of approx. -1.4 MPa (aw=0.99) measured with a Hygroskop-BT (Rotronic\nInstrument Corp.).The \u03a8s was modified ionically with NaCl (Lang, 1967) and non-\nionically with glycerol (Dallyn & Fox, 1980) to values reported in Table 1.\nThe \u03a8m was modified using Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000).  Known \namounts of PEG 8000 were added according to the equation of Michel and\nKaufmann (1973) as detailed by Magan (1988), to obtain target \u03a8m (Table 1).\nSterile circular discs (\u00f8 8.5 cm) of capillary matting were placed in sterile 9 cm Petri\ndishes containing approx. 15 mL of cooled medium. The matting was overlayed with\nsterile discs of polyester fibre and cellophane (P400, Cannings Ltd., Bristol, U.K.).\n2.2 Fungal growth and sporulation\nSpores of the 3 strains of A. flavus, obtained from a 7 day old Czapek dox\nagar culture, were suspended in 1% peptone-water, shaken vigorously and spread\nonto plates of the basic medium. Plates were incubated over night at 25\u00b0C to allow\nspore germination. The different \u03a8s and \u03a8m plates were inoculated centrally with an\nagar plug obtained using a 4 mm surface-sterilised cork borer. Four replicates were\nprepared of each treatment. Plates of the same \u03a8s\/\u03a8m were sealed in polyethylene\nbags and incubated at 25 and 30\u00b0C (12 hours day light). These temperatures were\nselected because optimal for fungal growth and common during the crucial period for\nsporulation in field.\n6The diameter of all colonies was measured daily in two orthogonal directions\nuntil one strain covered the whole plate for a maximum of 14 days. The extension\nrate (mm day-1) was computed for each treatment.\nData on sporulation were obtained in relation to \u03a8s stress only. Petri dishes \nwere inoculated as previously described and incubated for 7 d; colonies were\nwashed with 5 ml of sterile water added with 0.05% Tween 80 and the spore\nproduction determined with a haemocytometer as detailed by Parra et al. (2004). The\nexperiment was carried out with three replicates per treatment.\n2.3 Data analysis\nTwo dimensional profiles were drawn using Excel (Microsoft Office 2000) to\nshow the effect of time and \u03a8s\/\u03a8m on fungal extension. Radial extension in different\ntreatments and for all the strains were rescaled in the range 0 - 1 considering 85 mm\n(diameter of Petri dishes used) as the maximum possible extension for the tested\nstrains.\nThe analysis of variance (ANOVA) of all the collected data was carried out\nusing the statistical package MSTAT-C (Michigan State University, ver. 1, 1991, East\nLansing, MI, USA) and means were compared using the Tuckey test to determine\ntheir statistical significance. An experimental design with three factors (strain,\ntemperature and water stress) in a randomised complete block was used to analyse\nextension data and logarithmically transformed sporulation data [ln (value+1)].\n73. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1 Solute and matric stress effects on growth\nThe colony covered the whole plate in 7 and 13 days, respectively with \u03a8s and \n\u03a8m stress. ANOVA showed a significant effect (P<0.01) of all the main factors\n(strain, temperature and water stress type) on the colony extension (Table 2).\nNo growth was observed at -21.0 MPa and the extension rate at 25 and 30\u00b0C\nwas similar under \u03a8s stress (< 7.0 MPa water stress) regardless of the solute used \n(Fig. 1).\nIn \u03a8m stress conditions, the extension rate was generally about 50% of that\nmeasured with \u03a8s stress (Fig. 1). The best temperature among those tested was\n30\u00b0C, with no difference found between -1.4 and -2.8 MPa, while limits for growth\nwere about -14.0 and 21.0 MPa, respectively for \u03a8m and \u03a8s stress.\nComparing the effect of \u03a8s and \u03a8m stress on mycelial extension, - 2.8 MPa\nwas optimal under both imposed types of water stress and not significantly different\nfrom the unmodified media (-1.4 MPa). The Italian strains showed the ability to grow\ndown to -14.0 MPa in ionically modified \u03a8s medium, while under \u03a8m stress this was \nlimited to -9.8 MPa. The strains seemed to be more tolerant to both types of imposed\nwater stress than those from Argentina previously examined. In fact, Nesci et al.\n(2004) reported no growth at \u03a8s and \u03a8m < -14.0 MPa stress.\nSignificant differences in tolerance of \u03a8s and \u03a8m stress indicate a higher \nsensitivity to this factor. This was also supported by the time required to reach the\nmaximum extension. The lower tolerance to \u03a8m stress confirms the greater difficulty \ninvolved in extracting water from soil pores and the consequent limited solute\ntransport (Adebayo & Harris, 1971); as a consequence, soil colonisation would\n8probably occur over a narrower range of water availability when compared to that\nwhich occurs in maturing maize ears where \u03a8s stress is more important. This \ndifference in sensitivity was previously observed for Argentinean strains of A. flavus\n(Payne, 1992) and also with other species such as Alternaria alternata and some\nbasidiomycetes (Adebayo & Harris, 1971; Boddy, 1983; Whipps & Magan, 1987;\nMagan et al., 1995). In contrast, limited differences were observed in tolerance to \u03a8s \nand \u03a8m stress for ochratoxigenic strains of A. ochraceus (Lee & Magan, 1999;\nRamos et al., 1999).\nTwo dimensional profiles were drawn based on \u03a8s or \u03a8m x time interactions\n(Fig. 2) and differences between optimum and marginal conditions were observed as\nwell as lag phase necessary for fungal development.\nAt marginal incubation time (2 days) and \u03a8s (-21 MPa), no growth was observed in\nboth modified media; with more water stress, growth was influenced by solute type,\nwith an optimum at 5 days and -2.8 MPa with ionically modified media and 6 days\nand -1.4 to -2.8 MPa when glycerol was added (Fig. 2a).\nItalian aflatoxigenic strains have an optimal extension rate profile similar to\nthat found in the USA for isolates from groundnuts and maize. However in that study\ngermination\/growth has been reported till to -32.2 MPa, but only after more than 40\ndays incubation (Sanchis & Magan, 2004). Our interest was in how rapidly growth\ncould occur and the Italian strains were unable to do so at -21 MPa after 7 days\nincubation.\n3.2 Solute stress effects on sporulation\nStrain, temperature and water stress all significally (P<0.01) affected A. flavus\nconidia production. Two strains were similar (1.3\u0387105 conidia cm-2 colony) while the\n9other (A 2092) produced significantly more conidia (3.7\u0387105 conidia cm-2 colony).\nFurthermore, sporulation was significantly higher at 25\u00b0C than at 30\u00b0C (3.4\u0387105\nversus 1.4\u0387105).\nThe maximum number of spores was produced in unmodified medium (4.8\u0387107\nconidia cm-2 colony).), followed by 1.8\u0387107 at -2.8 MPa in \u03a8s and it decreased\nsignificantly at each \u03a8s variation with a complete inhibition with ionic solute at \u2265 -14.0\nMPa and to 4.7\u00b7105 conidia cm-2 colony at -21 MPa in glycerol modified medium..\nVery few studies have tried to quantify the efficacy of changing \u03a8s stress on \nconidial production.\nGervais & Molin (2003) and Parra et al (2004) found differences between\noptimal water potential conditions for growth and sporulation for Penicillium roqueforti\nand A. niger respectively. The strains used for testing sporulation in this study were\npreviously tested both for growth and AFB1 production in different temperature and\nwater availability conditions (Giorni et al., 2007). The results suggested that\ndifferences of 5\u00b0C and -0.7 MPa from the optimal conditions (25\u00b0C; -1.4 MPa) can\nproduce a 10-15% reduction in fungal extension and a significant reduction in AFB1\nproduction and sporulation (65-80% and 55% respectively) (data not shown). This\ncould be explained by results reported by Brodhagen & Keller (2006) regarding the\nregulation of both sporulation and mycotoxin production in A. flavus by G protein\nsignalling pathways. The relationship between mycotoxin production and sporulation\nwere also found by Mostafa et al. (2005) who demonstrated that most of the toxins\nwere produced after the fungus has completed its initial growth phase and began the\ndevelopment stage, represented by sporulation and sclerotia formation.\nData obtained in this study is critical in building up a picture of the key factors\nwhich influence growth and sporulation of strains of this important mycotoxigenic\n10\nspecies from northern Italy and similarly to the approach followed for Fusarium\nverticillioides (Battilani et al., 2003), they will contribute in the development of a\npredictive model.\nACKNOWLEDMENTS\nWork supported by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural and Forestry Policy (AFLARID\nproject).\nREFERENCES\nAdebayo AA, Harris RF, 1971.
