Ten years of erosion data from the Woburn Erosion Reference 15 \nExperiment, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, show that the total amount of carbon 16 \nremoved as particulate organic matter from individual plots ranged from 76 to 312 kg 17 \nha-1. In general losses were less from minimally tilled plots cultivated across the slope 18 \nthan from plots given standard cultivations up and down the slope. Losses of carbon 19 \nby erosion accounted for 2\u201350% of soil carbon change. Using a sediment delivery 20 \nmodel combined with carbon enrichment data from this study and previous literature, 21 \nwe calculate that the amount of carbon mobilized by erosion in England and Wales is 22 \nbetween 0.2 and 0.76 Tg C y-1, of which 0.12\u20130.46 Tg C y-1 is delivered to surface 23 \nwaters. If the eroded soil carbon were completely replaced and the eroded material 24 \nprotected from decomposition in sediments, then there is a potential sink on eroding 25 \n 2\ncropland in the UK of up to 0.75 Tg C y-1, which represents a significant uncertainty 26 \nin the terrestrial carbon budget. 27 \nKeywords: Soil carbon; soil erosion; tillage; sediment delivery; carbon delivery 28 \n1 Introduction 29 \nThe carbon cycle in soils is a key component of global and national carbon budgets 30 \nbut is poorly understood and quantified. To date all carbon budget calculations have 31 \nrelied on the assumption that, although there are additions to the soil carbon pool in 32 \nsolid forms, the only losses are gaseous. Recently this has been recognized as 33 \nerroneous since soils and landscapes are dynamic (Stallard, 1998; Lobb et al., 2002). 34 \nSome soils lose material by water erosion; it moves down slope where it may be 35 \nredeposited or transferred to surface water bodies. Other soils may receive material 36 \nfrom upslope by water erosion, or from aeolian or river flood deposition. Tillage can 37 \nalso translocate material to lower slope positions (Van Oost et al., 2004).  38 \nTransported soil material contains carbon and nitrogen, and therefore influences the 39 \ncycling of both elements in soils. Lobb et al. (2002) hypothesize that the loss of 40 \ncarbon and nitrogen from upper slope positions decreases emissions from those points 41 \nin the landscape, but also state that where parent material rich in carbonate is exposed 42 \nby the erosion emissions may increase. Whether or not there is a net gain across the 43 \nlandscape will depend upon the fate of the translocated material. If it is redeposited 44 \nwithin the landscape it may be oxidized or it may be buried and protected from 45 \noxidation. If burial occurs and carbon is replaced by plant inputs to eroding soils there 46 \nwill be a net gain in soil carbon. The uncertainty in carbon budgeting caused by 47 \ncarbon burial and its dynamic replacement has been highlighted by Stallard (1998) 48 \nand, as Harden et al. (1999) stated, full accounting of carbon and its decomposition in 49 \nuplands, lower slopes and valleys must be included in regional scale budgets before a 50 \n 3\nnet global term can be determined. One attempt to estimate the impact of soil erosion 51 \non carbon budgets by Lobb et al. (2002), suggested that it has decreased emissions of 52 \nCO2 by 5% from the Canadian prairies; this approximates to 1.9 Tg CO2 equivalent y-53 \n1. 54 \nAlthough it is possible to model soil carbon losses, and to estimate them from 55 \ncarbon measurements at sites with eroded and non-eroded phases of the same soil, as 56 \nHarden et al. (1999) did, there is a need to calculate carbon mobilization from eroded 57 \nfields.  However, such field measurements are rare. We know little about how 58 \nselective the erosion process is for carbon, or how the type of tillage used influences 59 \nthe amounts of carbon moved. In this paper we attempt to fill these gaps using ten 60 \nyears of data collected from the Woburn Erosion Reference Experiment in the United 61 \nKingdom (Catt et al., 1994; Quinton et al., 2001; Quinton and Catt, 2004). We then 62 \nconsider the implications of our findings for estimating the amounts of carbon eroded, 63 \nredeposited and delivered to watercourses in England and Wales. 64 \n2  Methods 65 \n2.1 Field data collection  66 \nData were collected from eight erosion plots located at Woburn Experimental Farm, 67 \nBedfordshire, UK (0\u00b033'5\"W, 52\u00b00'45\"N). Soils at the site range in texture from 68 \nloamy sand to sandy loam and correspond to the Cottenham and Lowlands series 69 \ndefined by Clayden et al. (1984), which are classified as Lamellic Ustipsamment and 70 \nUdic Haplustept (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) or Lamellic Arenosol and Fluvic Cambisol 71 \n(FAO, 1998), respectively. Mean characteristics determined from analyses of topsoil 72 \nsamples are given in Table 1. Slopes on the site vary between 8.5 and 13.5 degrees. 73 \nEach plot measured approximately 25 m by 35 m and was isolated from the rest of 74 \nthe slope by a low earth bank. Soil and water flowing off each plot were channeled to 75 \na collecting trough and through a pipe to two 2000 l tanks where they were stored 76 \n 4\nuntil sampled.  The amounts of runoff and soil loss from each plot were determined as 77 \nsoon after each runoff event as practically possible and usually within 48 hours.  A 78 \nrepresentative sub-sample of the sediment was air-dried and ground in an agate mill 79 \nbefore being analyzed for total carbon using a Perkin Elmer CHN elemental analyzer 80 \n(PE2400).  81 \n Soil samples were taken from the surface (0\u201310 cm) layer of the plots in 1990, 82 \n1992, 1993 and 1996 to measure changes in soil organic C content over time. 0\u201310 cm 83 \nwas chosen to correspond to the depth of the shallow tine cultivation on the minimally 84 \ncultivated plots, with the assumption that on the ploughed plots the soil in this layer 85 \nwould be well mixed. In 1990 the samples were combined for each plot and the 86 \nresults represent the means of two determinations per plot. On the other dates samples 87 \nwere taken on a grid with either nine (1993) or 12 (1992 and 1996) sampling points 88 \nper plot. After drying, total carbon was determined in the same way as for the 89 \nsediment.  90 \n2.2 Experimental design 91 \nFour plots were located in each of two blocks, which had different cropping histories 92 \nprior to the establishment of the experiment (Table 2). Block 0 occupied a lower part 93 \nof the slope than Block 1, but there was no significant difference (p<0.01) in slope 94 \ngradient between the blocks. Details of the treatments and cropping patterns are given 95 \nin Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The experimental site was established after harvest in 96 \n1988 and the first crop of potatoes was planted in the following spring. This crop was 97 \nfollowed by two winter cereals, then sugar beet and two more years of winter cereals, 98 \na rotation common in the area. The rotation was repeated twice, but with fodder beet 99 \nreplacing sugar beet in the second rotation. Two main treatments were used in the 100 \nexperiment: cultivation direction, either up-and-down (U) or across-slope (A); and 101 \ntillage type, either minimal (M) \u2013 for cereals straw was chopped, for potatoes and beet 102 \n 5\nthe haulm and tops were retained, both were partially incorporated by shallow tines or 103 \ndiscs to a maximum of 10cm depth \u2013 or standard (S) \u2013 for cereals straw was baled and 104 \nremoved, potato haulm and beet tops were raked up and removed, and the plots were 105 \nthen moldboard ploughed to approximately 25cm depth. All combinations of the two 106 \ntreatments are represented in each of the blocks.   107 \n All statistical analyses used the Statistica package (Statsoft, 2003). For analysis of 108 \nvariance, the experimental design allowed us to consider the effects of cultivation 109 \ndirection and tillage type separately and in combination. Differences between group 110 \nmeans was established using the Fisher LSD test.  Event data were treated in the 111 \nfollowing way: the total number of events was determined by those occurring on plot 112 \n7 of the experiment, which always produced runoff and erosion when any other plot 113 \nwas eroded, and occasionally when no other plot was. When runoff was produced 114 \nwith sediment amounts too small to sample, particulate carbon concentrations and 115 \nlosses were treated as zero. When sediment amounts were large enough to sample, but 116 \nthere was insufficient sediment for carbon analysis, the data were treated as missing. 117 \n2.3 National scale modeling 118 \nTo estimate the delivery and redeposition of carbon at a national scale, the approach 119 \nof McHugh et al. (2002), developed to estimate the amount of sediment delivered to 120 \nrivers in England and Wales, was used. McHugh\u2019s approach is better suited to 121 \nmodelling soil carbon losses at this scale than other erosion models, which are either 122 \ntoo parameter intensive, e.g. EUROSEM (Morgan et al., 1998) and WEPP (Nearing et 123 \nal., 1989), or do not account for the delivery and deposition of sediment, e.g. RUSLE 124 \n(Renard et al., 1991). A brief description of the model used is given here, and further 125 \ndetails can be found in McHugh et al. (2002). 126 \nThe sediment delivery model operates using spatial input data summarized to a 127 \ncommon 1 km2 grid, which provides mapped output at 1:250,000 scale. However, the 128 \n 6\ninherent resolution of individual data layers is as high as 50 m. For example, the 129 \ndigital terrain map elevation data and the summary of drainage density have a 130 \nresolution of 50 m, but the soils data and rainfall are provided at a 1 km grid spacing. 131 \nWhere 50 m data are available, inputs are based on spatially weighted averages. The 132 \nmodel calculates the amount of sediment eroded (E, equation 1) and then modifies it 133 \nwith a connectivity ratio (C) to give the amount of sediment (Y) reaching a stream, 134 \nand by difference the amount deposited (D, equation 2) within the field: 135 \nY = E C 1 136 \nD = E\u2013Y 2 137 \nEstimates of E for soil type and slope classes are obtained from a lookup table 138 \nderived from data collected from 696 field sites throughout England and Wales 139 \n(Harrod, 1998; Harrod et al., 2000; McHugh, 2000). They are limited to areas with 140 \nchanneled erosion features (rills and gullies) and do not include sheet erosion, so they 141 \nunderestimate actual erosion rates. 142 \nThe connectivity ratio is given by: 143 \nC = log (fs fd T)  3 144 \nThe slope shape factor (fs) was derived by taking the proportion of 2500 1 m2 cells 145 \nwithin a 1 km2 area which were convex. On the basis that convex slopes are 146 \nassociated with high delivery ratios, a greater proportion of convex slopes within a 1 147 \nkm2 grid cell indicates that more material is delivered to watercourses. The drainage 148 \npattern factor (fd) is derived, using an exponential decay, from the median distance of 149 \neach 2500 m2 grid cell to a stream or river (L) within the 1 km2 area (equation 4): 150 \nfd = e-1 k L  4 151 \nwhere k is a constant. The slope shape and drainage factors are scaled from 0 to 1. 152 \nThe transport capacity (T) is calculated using the expression: 153 \n 7\nT = q1.4z1.4 n-0.6d50-0.5  5 154 \nin which q is the runoff potential factor (equation 6), z is the slope in %, n is the 155 \nhydraulic roughness for different land uses and d50 is the median particle size of the 156 \nsoil. The runoff potential factor (q) is calculated from the hydrologically effective 157 \nrainfall (H) and the standard percentage runoff (R), which are derived from standard 158 \nrelationships given in Boorman et al. (1995): 159 \n4.1\n100\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b= HRq  6 160 \nTo estimate the amount of carbon delivered to rivers and streams and the amount 161 \nredeposited in the landscape, Y and D are multiplied by the carbon content of the soil 162 \n(Cc) and the carbon enrichment ratio (Cer) which is the ratio of carbon content of the 163 \nsediment to that in the soil.   164 \nThus the carbon delivered in material eroded from fields (Yc) is calculated from: 165 \nYc = Y Cc Cer  7 166 \nand that deposited within the catchment (Dc) as: 167 \nDc = D Cc Cer  8 168 \nAll parameters in the sediment delivery model are derived from nationally available 169 \ndatasets described in McHugh et al. (2002). 170 \n Percentage carbon contents of soils are available from the National Soil Inventory 171 \n(NSI) survey data for England and Wales (Loveland, 1990), which represents a 172 \nsystematic aligned sample of soil measurements at 5 km intervals. These are point 173 \nmeasurements at each sample site and do not represent the average conditions for the 174 \nsurrounding 25 km2 area. Equally, a simple arithmetic mean of the NSI measurements 175 \ndoes not represent a national average, because the sample design was not randomised. 176 \nIn order to generate national statistics, a method of estimation was devised. Erosion 177 \n 8\nrates and delivery to watercourses in England and Wales were summarised at a 178 \ncatchment scale, where the average catchment size used is 140 km2. This provides at 179 \nleast 6 and as many as 50 NSI points per catchment. The carbon content of the 180 \ncatchment\u2019s soil was assumed to be the mean value of the NSI data points within the 181 \ncatchment.  182 \n There are no data available for carbon enrichment ratios in the UK, apart from that 183 \nreported in this study. The international literature gives enrichment values for soil 184 \norganic matter (Table 5), but we could find none for carbon. We have therefore 185 \nassumed that the carbon contents of organic matter in the soil and sediment are the 186 \nsame, and that the organic matter enrichment ratio is equivalent to that for carbon. 187 \nUsing this assumption we have run the model for the minimum and maximum values 188 \nfrom the literature and the mean value from the Woburn data set. 189 \n It should be noted that Yc is often less than the catchment export of carbon since it 190 \ndoes not include contributions from sheet erosion, bank erosion or within stream 191 \nsources of carbon. In addition it does not account for instream cycling of carbon. 192 \n3  Results 193 \n3.1 Bulk soil and carbon losses 194 \nThe direction of cultivation had a significant effect on total soil and carbon movement 195 \nat the experimental site (Table 6). Mean event soil loss from the U treatment (307 kg 196 \nha-1) was significantly (p<0.05) greater than that (178 kg ha-1) from the A treatment. 197 \nThe mean carbon concentration of sediment from the U plots (3.6%) was significantly 198 \n(p<0.01) less than that (4.33%) from the A plots, but despite this, the A plots had 199 \nsignificantly (p<0.01) smaller mean event losses of carbon (4.5 kg ha-1) than the U 200 \nplots (6.7 kg ha-1). The mean carbon content of sediment from the M plots (4.2%) was 201 \nsignificantly (P<0.05) greater  than that from the S plots (3.7%). 202 \n 9\n When the cultivation direction and the tillage type treatments were combined 203 \n(Table 6), the mean carbon content of the sediment from the US treatment (3.4%) was 204 \nsignificantly (p<0.01) less than from the AM combination (4.6%); it was also 205 \nsignificantly (p<0.05) less than the UM (3.8%) and AS (4.0%) combinations. 206 \nHowever, the AM treatment had a significantly smaller (p<0.01) mean event carbon 207 \nloss (2.7 kg ha-1) than the US (6.5 kg ha-1) and UM (6.9 kg ha-1) treatments. This was 208 \nbecause the mean event soil loss from the AM treatment (113 kg ha-1) was 209 \nsignificantly less (p<0.05) than from the UM (307 kg ha-1) and US (307 kg ha-1) 210 \ntreatments, so that despite the higher carbon concentrations, the carbon loss per unit 211 \narea was less for AM than for the other three combinations of treatments. The only 212 \nsignificant differences found between the two blocks of the experiment were between 213 \nindividual treatments (Table 7).  Mean carbon concentration was significantly greater 214 \n(p<0.01) in the sediment from the U Block 1 plots (4.1%) than from the U Block 0 215 \nplots (3.1%), and significant differences in sediment carbon concentration also 216 \noccurred between the US, AM and AS treatment combinations. However, the same 217 \npattern was not repeated in the carbon loss data because of the differences in soil loss 218 \nbetween the two blocks. The soil losses are inversely correlated (r = \u22120.90, p<0.01) 219 \nwith the carbon content of the sediment for the various combined treatments. 220 \n Over the ten years of the experiment the total amount of particulate carbon removed 221 \nfrom the various treatments and combinations of treatments ranged from 76 to 317 kg 222 \nha-1 (Table 8). The mean of 312 kg ha-1 for the U treatments was significantly greater 223 \n(p<0.05) than the 135 kg ha-1 for the A treatments, reflecting the greater soil losses 224 \nfrom the U treatments. No other treatment difference was significant at the p<0.05 225 \nlevel and there was no significant difference between the two blocks.  226 \n 10\n3.2 Distribution of carbon losses in the sediment through time 227 \nFigure 1 shows the distribution of %C losses for one plot from each treatment 228 \ncombination. Losses were not evenly distributed through the monitoring period and 229 \ntended to be concentrated into episodes, which generally occurred in the winter 230 \nmonths, when the ground had a sparse vegetation cover and the soils were at or above 231 \nfield capacity. In the ten years of the experiment there were four major periods of C 232 \nloss: 1989\/90; 1992\/1993; 1995\/96 and 1998 (Figure 1). In 1989\/90 and 1995\/96 233 \nwinter wheat was planted later than usual leading to a sparse vegetation cover. This 234 \nexposed the soil surface to raindrop impact, which caused structural degradation and 235 \nthe formation of a surface crust. Combined with higher than average rainfall, this led 236 \nto runoff and erosion. Periods of erosion in 1992\/93 and 1998 were associated with 237 \nsugar and fodder beet crops, which were planted in the late spring and harvested in the 238 \nlate autumn. The soil was therefore exposed during the late spring and early summer, 239 \nwhen convectional storms are frequent. Heavy machinery is also used during the 240 \nharvesting of beet crops, and this can compact the soils leading to lower infiltration 241 \nrates, and therefore more runoff and erosion. Figure 1 also shows that the magnitude 242 \nof individual event losses was very variable and not always explained by monthly 243 \nrainfall. Instead individual event losses probably depended on a complex interaction 244 \nof soil antecedent conditions, storm rainfall intensity patterns and the development of 245 \nthe crop canopy. The total number of events was less on the four A plots (149) than 246 \non those with U cultivations (221).  247 \n There was no evidence of any changes in the % carbon content of sediments during 248 \nthe life of the experiment. 249 \n3.3 Carbon changes in the soil 250 \nEffect of cultivation direction. Figure 2 shows a general downward trend over time 251 \nin mean soil carbon levels for both the U and A treatments for both blocks. However, 252 \n 11\nthe only significant difference (p<0.05) was between 1990 and 1996 for the U 253 \ntreatment. The least mean value was for the U treatment in 1992, but it was not 254 \nsignificantly less than those for other years. Given the number of samples taken from 255 \nthe U plots in 1992 (48 in total) and the fact that the 1992 dip in soil carbon content is 256 \npresent in the data from each of the U plots but not in any of the A plots, we cannot 257 \nattribute this to analytical error, but it does appear out of step with the other data. 258 \nThere were no significant differences between tillage treatments within the same year, 259 \nbut Figure 2 suggests  that the A plots maintained higher carbon contents, though 260 \nthere were no statistically significant differences. Block 1 also has a consistently 261 \ngreater mean carbon content than Block 0 (Figure 2), but no differences were 262 \nsignificant.  263 \n Effect of tillage type. Figure 3 shows generally decreasing carbon percentages over 264 \ntime in the S plots, particularly for Block 0, although no differences between years 265 \nwere significant. The M plots showed an initially rapid decline followed by almost 266 \nstable values, and differences between 1990 and 1992 and 1993 for Block 0 were 267 \nsignificant at the p<0.05 level. Apart from the 1990 data, the soil of the S treatment on 268 \nBlock 0 had significantly (p<0.01) lower carbon percentages than those of the M plots 269 \non both blocks 0 and 1 and the S plots on block 1 in each year.  270 \n Effect of treatment combinations. When the two treatments were combined 271 \n(Figure 4), similar patterns of declining carbon contents appeared. However, only two 272 \nsets of data were significantly different at the p<0.05 level: the 1992 and 1993 data for 273 \nthe US combination; and the 1990 and 1993 data for the AM combination.  When the 274 \ndata were paired by year (Figure 5) a clearer pattern emerged, with the AM plots 275 \nhaving significantly greater carbon contents in all years than those with AS 276 \ncultivation. Excluding the data for 1990, the difference between carbon contents on 277 \n 12\nthe AM and AS plots increased over time. No such trend occurred for the U plots. 278 \nHowever, if the data are split by block so that each plot can be considered separately 279 \n(Figure 6), it is evident that much of the difference between the AM and other 280 \ntreatments can be attributed to its greater carbon content on Block 0. Figure 6 also 281 \nshows downward trends in carbon contents for each plot. However, only that for the 282 \nUS Block 0 plot is significant at p<0.05 (Table 9).  283 \n3.4 Contribution of soil erosion to carbon changes in the soil 284 \nTable 10 examines the carbon budget in two different time periods: 1990 to 1996, 285 \nwhich showed the largest overall decline in carbon contents due to the rapid decline 286 \nbetween 1990 and 1992 for many of the sites (Figures 2\u20136); and 1992 to 1996 when 287 \ncarbon contents changed less rapidly.  288 \n Estimating the proportion of the change in soil carbon associated with soil erosion 289 \nis difficult because small errors in measuring % carbon of the soil lead to large errors 290 \nin the estimation of the total amount of carbon in the topsoil. Also no account is taken 291 \nof material incorporated from the subsurface horizon where carbon contents are much 292 \nless (0.01\u20130.04%) when the soil surface has been lowered by erosion. However, 293 \ncarbon budgets for each of the plots provide ballpark figures for the proportion of 294 \ncarbon lost by water erosion of arable land in lowland England. The data are 295 \nconsidered by plot to avoid obscuring differences caused by averaging across 296 \ntreatments. 297 \n Particulate carbon loss was determined from the sediment data. Total carbon loss 298 \nfrom the soil was calculated from the differences between the mean % soil carbon 299 \nvalues for each treatment and treatment combination for the respective soil sampling 300 \ndates, assuming that the carbon was lost from a 0.1 m layer with a bulk density of 1.3 301 \nMg m-3. For the 1990\u201396 data the proportion of carbon lost in sediment was largest 302 \n(50%) for the US Block 0 plot, where erosion was most severe, and smallest (2\u20134%) 303 \n 13\nfor the AM plots of both blocks. Other plots lost 10\u201324% of carbon through erosion. 304 \nThe smaller percentage losses resulted from lower erosion rates. In the period 1992\u2013305 \n96 the soil carbon changes ranged from -383 kg ha-1 to +715 kg ha-1. Where carbon 306 \ncontents were decreasing (UM, AM and US plots of Block 0 and US of Block 1), the 307 \nproportion lost as particulate carbon ranged from 10 to 38%.  Although the figures for 308 \nboth periods are subject to considerable uncertainty, the highest value (50%) suggests 309 \nthat erosion can have a significant impact on the carbon balance of arable soils subject 310 \nto moderate rates of erosion. 311 \n3.5 Selective erosion of carbon 312 \nMean values of Cer for the combined treatments ranged between 3.1 and 4.0 (Table 6) 313 \nwith an overall mean value of 3.4. However, there is only one significant difference 314 \nwithin the data set: the AS treatment had a significantly (p<0.01) higher value than 315 \nthe US. There were significant differences between pairs of treatments in the two 316 \nblocks (Table 7), but the ratio was not consistently higher  in one block than the other.  317 \n3.6 National scale delivery and deposition of carbon 318 \nThe modelled amount of carbon delivered to rivers in England and Wales ranges from 319 \n0.12 to 0.46 Tg y-1(Table 11).  Modelled redeposition of eroded carbon in the 320 \nlandscape is less (0.08\u20130.29 Tg y-1). If the data are considered on a catchment by 321 \ncatchment basis and normalized to take account of different catchment sizes, they are 322 \nnegatively skewed (Figure 7a), with almost all catchments delivering 0.5 Mg km2 C y-323 \n1 or less to watercourses. However, there are a few catchments which deliver as much 324 \nas 3 Mg km2 C y-1 to surface waters. As Figure 7b shows, for most catchments there is 325 \nusually more carbon delivered to rivers and streams than is redeposited in the 326 \nlandscape. Although Table 11 shows that the model output is sensitive to changes in 327 \nCer, we have no basis on which to change Cer with changing catchment characteristics, 328 \nso it is the soil carbon content (Figure 8a) and the erosion (Figure 8b) that influence 329 \n 14\nthe amount of carbon delivered to the streams. Carbon delivered is linearly related to 330 \nsoil carbon content (r = 0.79, p<0.01), although there is considerable scatter in the 331 \ndata, with some high carbon soils delivering little or no carbon to the stream network, 332 \nbecause of the lack of erosion. The relationship with erosion rate is more scattered (r 333 \n= 0.58, p<0.01); there is generally more carbon delivery when there is more erosion, 334 \nbut the highest carbon deliveries are not associated with the highest erosion rates.   335 \n4 Discussion 336 \nBy presenting barriers to the flow of water down slope, soils cultivated across the 337 \nslope retain more water and slow the runoff, leading to less erosion. The smaller total 338 \nsediment carbon losses from the A plots at Woburn than from the U plots, and the 339 \ngreater mean event sediment carbon losses from the UM and US plots are 340 \nconsequently to be expected.  The greater carbon concentrations in the sediment from 341 \nthe AM treatment than from the US treatment may be a function of the organic matter 342 \nadditions to the minimally cultivated sites; they are in line with increases in soil 343 \ncarbon reported by other authors for minimally cultivated and no-tillage systems, but 344 \ndifferences were significant only in 1992 (p<0.05) and 1996 (p<0.01). Our results 345 \nsuggest that to minimize losses of carbon by erosion, then crop rows across the slope 346 \ncombined with minimal cultivation should be adopted. However, practical problems 347 \nassociated with this have been highlighted by Quinton and Catt (2004), including the 348 \nunsafe use of tractors on steep slopes and the concentration of runoff in depressions 349 \nbehind crop rows, leading to increased erosion when the depressions overflow. 350 \n The mean decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) contents for all soils in the UK has 351 \nbeen quantified (Webb et al., 2001) at 0.58% over the period 1980\u201395. However for 352 \nsandy soils, such as those at Woburn, they suggested a slight rise in SOC levels over 353 \nthis period, possibly associated with the greater use of animal manures. At Woburn no 354 \n 15\nanimal manures were applied and carbon contents initially fell but then remained 355 \nrelatively constant. The initial fall in the carbon content of the soils was probably due 356 \nto the cropping history of the site prior to the experiment (Table 2). During the growth 357 \nof lucerne (a nitrogen fixing crop) there would probably have been an increase in soil 358 \norganic matter content, and the change to winter cereals in 1988 probably led to 359 \nmineralization of this freshly incorporated organic matter. The tail of this decline 360 \nprobably extended into the first few years of the experiment.  361 \nOur data suggest that, although erosion played an important role in removing soil 362 \ncarbon, as in some circumstances 50% of all the carbon lost was lost by erosion, it 363 \nwas not the principle mechanism for decreasing carbon contents during the 364 \nexperiment. Most of the decline in soil carbon was probably attributable to 365 \nmineralization. There may also have been some reduction in topsoil carbon content by 366 \nploughing up and incorporating carbon poor subsoil on the standard cultivation plots. 367 \nThere is some support for this effect in Figure 3, which shows lower carbon contents 368 \nin the standard cultivated plots on Block 0 than for the other plots of the experiment, 369 \nalthough the effect is not apparent in block 1. However, the proportion of carbon lost 370 \nthrough erosion (2\u201350%) does indicate that even on soils with low carbon contents yet 371 \nsubject to moderate rates of erosion, erosion can have a major impact on soil carbon 372 \nbudgets. 373 \n Substantial amounts of particulate carbon were mobilized and transported in 374 \noverland flow under arable cropping at the Woburn field site. The average annual loss 375 \nrates of 7.6\u201331 kg ha-1 y-1 are similar to the 7\u201326 kg ha-1 y-1 quoted by Tipping et al. 376 \n(1997) for carbon loads of six of the tributaries flowing into the River Humber in 377 \nNorthern England, but less than the 57 kg ha-1 y-1 calculated for 29 British catchments 378 \nexceeding 100 km2 by Hope et al. (1997). They are also similar to the 25 kg ha-1 y-1 379 \n 16\ncalculated by Stallard (1998) as the global particulate organic carbon discharge from 380 \nthe world\u2019s rivers to its oceans.  As not all material mobilized on fields is delivered to 381 \nrivers, the values given by Tipping et al. (1997) and Hope et al. (1997) suggest that 382 \nparticulate carbon erosion rates across the UK as a whole may be greater than we 383 \nmeasured at Woburn. This could arise if the rates of erosion and\/or the initial carbon 384 \ncontent of the soil at Woburn were less than average for Britain. Hope et al. (1997) 385 \nsuggested that their estimated particulate organic carbon exports for British rivers may 386 \nbe an order of magnitude too low, as storm peaks are often missed by rigid weekly 387 \nsampling regimes, so the river based estimates are likely to be too small.  388 \n The annual amounts of soil erosion that we measured at the Woburn site (0.41\u20131.91 389 \nt ha-1 y-1) do seem to be less than other UK data. In a monitoring programme (1973\u2013390 \n79) on the same site prior to establishment of the experiment, Morgan et al. (1987) 391 \nmeasured rates of 0.62 to 0.89 t ha-1 y-1, but under similar land uses in the neighboring 392 \narea the range of annual erosion rates was 0.3 to 6.9 t ha-1 y-1, and where the soil was 393 \nkept bare measured rates were as high as 44 t ha-1 y-1. National studies in the UK also 394 \nsuggest that the rates of erosion we measured were moderate. For example in terms of 395 \nsoil volume the mean annual Woburn erosion rates (0.5\u20132.5 m3 ha-1 y-1) lie at the 396 \nlower end of those (1\u20135 m3 ha-1 y-1) for a range of different crops grown in the UK 397 \nbased on aerial photograph interpretation and field survey (Evans, 2002).  398 \n The fate of eroded soil carbon in sediment is important when considering terrestrial 399 \ncarbon budgets. As has been pointed out, not all eroded carbon is delivered to rivers 400 \nor lakes. Some is redeposited in the landscape and subsequently buried by further 401 \nsedimentation episodes. Tillage erosion will also contributes to the redistribution of 402 \ncarbon in the landscape, translocating material down slopes and contributing to the 403 \nformation of colluvium in areas under arable cultivation (Van Oost et al., 2004). Little 404 \n 17\nis known about the fate of this material, nor do we know much about replacement of 405 \nthe carbon in the soil from which it was removed. A site of soil redeposition can be a 406 \ncarbon sink, where the eroded carbon is protected from decomposition, or a carbon 407 \nsource, where the sediment carbon oxidizes (Manies et al., 2001). Studies in New 408 \nZealand on datable landslide scars suggest that 80% of the carbon removed by the 409 \nlandslides may be replaced within 50 years of the landside scar revegetating (Baisden 410 \net al., 2002). At Woburn, where erosion is less episodic, we assume that the soil is 411 \ncontinually receiving C in plant remains containing C from the atmosphere but is also 412 \nlosing organic matter and releasing CO2 to the atmosphere by mineralization, and that 413 \nthe relative rates of these two processes together with the rate of carbon lost by 414 \nerosion determine whether the soil carbon content increases or decreases. The 415 \nstabilization of the soil carbon contents in the later part of the experiment (Figures 2 416 \nand 3) suggests that soil carbon content could rise if erosion is controlled. However, 417 \nwith soil erosion the potential for sequestration only exists if the eroded carbon is 418 \nprotected from oxidation by burial, or depletion of the carbon by erosion increases the 419 \nsoil\u2019s potential to fix carbon: we have no evidence for or against either possibility.  420 \n The role of soil erosion in displacing terrestrial carbon which may or may not be 421 \nreplaced adds considerable uncertainty to estimates of the potential of different land 422 \nmanagement strategies for mitigating increasing atmospheric CO2. Our modeling 423 \nsuggests that between 0.12 and 0.46 Tg y-1 C is delivered to watercourses in England 424 \nand Wales. This is of the same order as the 0.17 Tg y-1 (adjusted to account for a 425 \nslightly greater area used in our modeling) calculated by Hope et al. (1997) for carbon 426 \nexport from rivers in England and Wales in 1993. Their figure was based on the 427 \nassumptions that carbon makes up 12% of the suspended solids in the rivers, and that 428 \nmany storm peaks were missed during sampling, so it can be considered a 429 \n 18\nconservative estimate. Our figure is also conservative because it does not take into 430 \naccount riverine carbon cycling, storage and remobilization of sediments, the addition 431 \nof material from bank erosion and from vegetation near to and within the river. 432 \nFurther additional corroboration of our modeled values comes from the Woburn data. 433 \nIf we use the figure of  156,139 km2 as the area of England and Wales, and assume 434 \nthat the range of annual sediment carbon losses from Woburn are representative of the 435 \nwhole country, national losses of C by erosion are between 0.12 and 0.48 Tg y-1, 436 \nalmost the same as our modeled estimates. If we accept the estimates of carbon export 437 \nby Hope et al. (1997) and our own modeled estimates of carbon delivered to rivers in 438 \nEngland and Wales, the balance between C inputs from erosion and the export of C 439 \nfrom  English and Welsh river systems lies somewhere between +0.05 and -0.29 Tg C 440 \ny-1. This suggests that rivers are either a small source of C, have internal processes 441 \nwhich release carbon to the atmosphere or can act as C sinks by deposition of 442 \nalluvium.   443 \n The implications of our work for the national carbon budget of the UK depend to 444 \nsome extent on the fate of the material. If we assume that the eroded carbon is 445 \ncompletely replaced and the eroded material is completely protected from 446 \ndecomposition in sediments, either terrestrial or aquatic, then there is a potential sink 447 \non eroding land in England and Wales of 0.2 to 0.75 Tg C y-1. However, this range 448 \nrepresents an extreme situation. Rather than being buried, some of the eroded carbon 449 \nis likely to be oxidized, so that the true range of values for potential C sink is less. 450 \nNevertheless, the values are comparable to the C sequestration potential of some 451 \nrecommended arable land management strategies, such as straw incorporation or no-452 \ntill (Smith et al., 2000). As a proportion of UK carbon emissions, estimated at 145 Tg 453 \nof carbon in 1999 (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, 2001), the 454 \n 19\nrange of 0.2\u20130.75 Tg C y-1 represents 0.13\u20130.52% and is similar in magnitude to the 455 \nother terrestrial sink terms given by Cannell et al. (1995).  However, given the 456 \nnegative impact of erosion on soils and the diffuse pollution resulting from sediment 457 \ndelivery to surface waters, allowing soil to erode to increase terrestrial carbon stocks 458 \nis not an option we would wish to promote. 459 \n As with all models of the environment, our approach suffers from uncertainties, 460 \nboth structural (uncertainties in the model) and parametric (difficulties in 461 \nparameterizing the model).  We have tried to reflect these, in part, by giving a range 462 \nof possible outputs reflecting uncertainty concerning the carbon enrichment ratio. 463 \nWhile the model may perform reasonably well for agricultural mineral soils, we know 464 \nrelatively little about erosion processes on organic rich soils and it is likely that the 465 \nmodel is in error in these locations. Other parameters within the model are also 466 \ndifficult to determine, such as the drainage pattern and slope shape factors, and ideally 467 \nrequire better calibration. Field data sets suitable for this purpose are needed at 468 \nsuitable scales and from a variety of environmental settings.  469 \n5 Conclusions 470 \nOur results quantify the amounts of carbon being mobilized by soil erosion in an 471 \narable agricultural setting in the UK. Our measured values of 7.6\u201331 kg C ha-1 y-1 are 472 \nsimilar to other estimates based on river sediments both nationally and globally, and 473 \nare also similar to estimates from hill slopes in the USA (Manies et al., 2001). The 474 \nrates are influenced by different tillage practices: cultivation up and down the slope 475 \nled to greater carbon losses than cultivations across the slope; losses from minimally 476 \ncultivated plots were less than from standard cultivations but differences were not 477 \nsignificant.  These losses have important implications for the estimation of carbon 478 \n 20\nfluxes from arable soils since they accounted for 2\u201350% of all carbon lost from the 479 \nplots.  480 \n At the national scale we estimate that between 0.12 and 0.46 Tg C y-1 is delivered to 481 \nsurface waters in England and Wales and that between 0.08 and 0.29 Tg C y-1 is 482 \nredeposited within the landscape. We do not know whether the redeposited carbon is 483 \nburied and protected from oxidization, oxidized, or remobilized by subsequent erosion 484 \nevents, nor do we know the fate of the material delivered to the rivers. These 485 \nuncertainties will need to be constrained if our estimates of the impact of erosion on 486 \nnational scale carbon budgets are to be improved. 487 \n6 Notation 488 \nE eroded sediment, m3 ha-1 y-1 489 \nC connectivity ratio, dimensionless 490 \nY  sediment delivered to stream, m3 ha-1 y-1 491 \nYc carbon delivered to stream, m3 ha-1 y-1 492 \nD sediment deposited in the landscape, m3 ha-1 y-1 493 \nfs slope shape factor, (0\u20131) 494 \nfd  drainage pattern factor (0\u20131) 495 \nT transport capacity, dimensionless 496 \nL median distance of each 2500 m2 grid cell to a stream or river, m 497 \nk a constant, (0\u20133) 498 \nq runoff potential, mm 499 \nz slope, % 500 \nn Manning\u2019s n roughness coefficient, m1\/6 501 \nd50 median grain size of soil, mm 502 \nH hydrologically effective rainfall, mm 503 \n 21\nR standard percentage runoff, dimensionless 504 \nCc carbon content of the soil, % 505 \nCer  carbon enrichment ratio, dimensionless 506 \n7 Acknowledgments. 507 \n  The authors acknowledge the support of the many colleagues associated with the 508 \nexperiment and the resources provided by Cranfield University, Rothamsted 509 \nExperimental Station and the University of East London, and to John Hollis of the 510 \nNational Soil Resources Institute for help with classifying the soils.
