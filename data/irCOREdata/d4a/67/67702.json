Introduction\n[2] Author\u2019s note: During the revision of this manuscript,\nour dear friend and colleague Kirsten Lorentzen passed\naway suddenly. We hope that in its final form this manu-\nscript maintains the high standards she exemplified.\n[3] Following some magnetic storms, energetic (MeV)\nelectron flux becomes enhanced in Earth\u2019s outer radiation\nbelt. The outer radiation belt is a natural environment where\nphysical processes occur that can neither easily be simulated\nnor synthesized in the laboratory. Many processes have\nbeen suggested that appear to be capable, if not culpable, of\naccelerating electrons to MeV energies from a lower energy\nsource population. We present here a combination of a\nvariety of observations into a superposed epoch comparison\nof magnetic storms that result in high MeV electron flux\n(\u2018\u2018events\u2019\u2019) with storms that result in low MeV electron flux\n(\u2018\u2018nonevents\u2019\u2019).\n[4] We begin with a description of the phenomenology of\nMeV electrons in the outer radiation belts, followed by a\nbrief review of proposed acceleration mechanisms. Then we\nproceed with our data analysis, which will include ground\nobservations of ULF waves, low-altitude observations of\nbursty MeV electron precipitation (microbursts), which we\nuse as a proxy for VLF waves, and fluxes of trapped\nelectrons themselves. Finally, we suggest that a dual electron\nacceleration process, which includes both local acceleration\nby VLF waves and diffusive energization and transport by\nULF waves, is consistent with our observations and analysis.\n1.1. Energetic Electron Phenomenology\n[5] Energetic electron acceleration appears to be associ-\nated with magnetic activity combined with high solar wind\nvelocity. The role of magnetic activity has been assumed\nsince the 1960s, when Williams [1966] established that the\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

Later, the solar connection was refined\nwhen Paulikas and Blake [1979] established that solar wind\nvelocity was well correlated with trapped energetic electron\nfluxes. On the basis of further studies of upstream con-\nditions, which showed that southward interplanetary mag-\nnetic field (IMF), in addition to high solar wind velocity,\nenhanced trapped electron radiation, it is likely that at least\nsome level of magnetic activity is required for electron\nacceleration [Baker, 1996; Baker et al., 1997; Obara et al.,\n1998; Iles et al., 2002]. It is also clear that magnetic storms\ngreatly alter the electron belts, whether to empty them or to\nrefill them [Friedel et al., 2002; Reeves et al., 2003].\n[6] Whatever the response of the radiation belts to a\nmagnetic storm, all L shells appear to respond similarly,\non long enough timescales [Kanekal et al., 2001]. Fast loss\ninto the magnetopause and atmosphere can alter the radia-\ntion belts on timescales of a few hours. Slower loss\nprocesses, such as weak pitch angle scattering or coulomb\ndrag, which is slow at high altitude, governs the decay of\nthe radiation belts over days to weeks, should the magne-\ntosphere remain quiet for such long intervals. Electron\nacceleration, however, almost always occurs on a relatively\nshort timescale, in association with at least a small amount\nof magnetic activity. Typical timescales are \u00012 days be-\ntween the onset of magnetic activity or high solar wind\nvelocity and the peak in the radiation belt fluxes for fluxes\nof 3 MeV electrons at geosynchronous orbit [Paulikas and\nBlake, 1979; Baker et al., 1990], or 1\u20132 days for low-\naltitude fluxes of >400 keV electrons over a range of L\nvalues [Baker et al., 1994].\n[7] In addition to the timescale constraint for electron\nacceleration, considerable information about the accelera-\ntion process can be inferred from the spatial (L) structure of\nthe trapped MeV electrons. Satellites whose orbits cut\nthrough the radiation belts, crossing L shells, tend to\nobserve a peak in flux versus L at a given energy. This\npeak resides in the vicinity of L \u0001 3\u20135 for MeV electrons.\nThe location of this peak, at least for storm-generated\nrelativistic electrons, appears to be controlled by the min-\nimum Dst of the storm [Tverskaya, 1986, 1996; Iles et al.,\n2002; Tverskaya et al., 2002]. Tverskaya et al. [2002] gives\nLmax \u0001 12:9=jminDstj1=4 \u00f01\u00de\nas the relationship between the electron flux peak and\nminimum Dst.\n[8] A more elusive, and potentially more valuable, ob-\nservation is that of phase space density structure in L. The\ncalculation of phase space density requires an accurate\nmagnetic field model, which, to date, does not exist for\ndisturbed time periods. Selesnick and Blake [2000] used a\nvariety of magnetic field models to determine whether there\nwas evidence for meaningful L structure in electron phase\nspace densities derived from Polar observations. They\nconcluded that there was no evidence for a peak interior\nto L \u0001 4, but that existing field models disagree at higher L.\nGreen [2002] attempted to resolve the magnetic field model\nproblem with a sensitivity analysis and found what appeared\nto be a robust peak in electron phase-space density at L \u0001 5\nfor several storms in 1998 observed by Polar. There is\nrelatively good evidence that phase space density is typi-\ncally higher at geosynchronous orbit than at L \u0001 4.5\n[Hilmer et al., 2000; McAdams et al., 2001]. However,\nwhether any important structure exists between these two\naltitudes remains in dispute. It is also unclear what equation\n(1) tells us about phase-space density.\n[9] Finally, it is appropriate to include a brief discussion\nof lower energy electrons. Geosynchronous satellites rou-\ntinely observe dispersionless injections of energetic elec-\ntrons associated with substorms [Li et al., 1998]. The\ninjected electrons bear typical energies of 10s to 100s of\nkeV. Kim et al. [2000] showed that it is at least possible that\nsome small fraction of the injected electrons achieve MeV\nenergies, and Ingraham et al. [2001] provided an event\nstudy that suggests substorms can indeed inject substantial\nquantities of MeV electrons through geosynchronous orbit.\n[10] At still lower energies, the plasmasphere is full of\n\u2018\u2018cold\u2019\u2019 electrons, with typical energies around 1 eV. These\nelectrons nominally extend from low altitude to about\nL \u0001 4.5, and they drift around Earth once per day (corota-\ntion). The plasmasphere is believed to fill over several days\nfrom the ionosphere, so that the outer edge of the plasma-\nsphere, the plasmapause, can extend well beyond L \u0001 4.5\nduring quiet times. However, as activity increases, the outer\nlayers of the plasmasphere are stripped off, bringing the\nplasmapause to as low as L \u0001 2 [see, for example,\nCarpenter and Anderson, 1992; Moldwin et al., 2002].\nRecent work by O\u2019Brien and Moldwin [2003] shows that\nthe location of the plasmapause Lpp (without regard to local\ntime) can be modeled as a function of the minimum Dst\nobserved over the past 24 hours:\nLpp \u0001 6:3\u0005 1:57 log10 jDstj: \u00f02\u00de\n[11] Interestingly, the Lpp model described by O\u2019Brien\nand Moldwin [2003] in equation (2) resembles the Lmax\nmodel described by Tverskaya et al. [2002] in equation (1).\nWhereas different functional forms were chosen for the two\nmodels, over the range of minimum Dst commonly\nexpressed by the magnetosphere, the two functions are\nactually quite similar. Figure 1 shows that Lmax \u0001 1.3 Lpp\nfor Dst ranging from about \u000540 to \u0005500 nT. Also included\nin the figure are several flux peaks in >1 MeV electrons\ndetermined from SAMPEX (Solar, Anomalous and Magne-\ntospheric Particle Explorer) (for instrument description, see\nKlecker et al. [1993]) and in >1.5 MeVelectrons determined\nfrom the HEO3 (1997\u2013068) satellite (for instrument de-\nscription, see Blake et al. [1997]). The uncertainty in the\nLmax determination is indicated by the vertical lines con-\nnecting multiple peaks (measured by a single spacecraft on\nsuccessive passes through the radiation belts). Within the\nscatter of the data, the flux increases fit both the Lmax curve\nfrom Tverskaya et al. [2002] and the 1.3 Lpp curve, after\nO\u2019Brien and Moldwin [2002]. We note that the factor 1.3\nmay depend on energy. The correspondence of the Lmax and\nLpp curves suggests that the relationship attributed to\ncurrents by Tverskaya et al. [2002] may be more closely\nrelated to the plasmapause. We will return to the implica-\ntions of this relationship below.\n1.2. Electron Acceleration Mechanisms\n[12] Friedel et al. [2002] cite at least nine different\nmechanisms for generating relativistic electrons in the outer\nradiation belts, of which only a subset will be treated here.\nSMP 11 - 2 O\u2019BRIEN ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRONS AND VLF AND ULF WAVES\nIn all cases, it is common to assume a seed population of\n\u0001100 keV electrons provided by substorms and convection.\nWe will break the acceleration models into categories based\non which waves are involved: ULF models, VLF models,\nand hybrid models.\n[13] Falthammar [1968] described what has come to be\nknown as \u2018\u2018simple\u2019\u2019 radial diffusion. In this model electro-\nmagnetic perturbations with spectral power at the frequency\nof an electron\u2019s drift orbit can cause stochastic diffusion in\nthe drift invariant (L) while preserving the cyclotron and\nbounce invariants of the electron\u2019s motion. As the electron\nmoves to lower L and stronger magnetic field, it gains\nenergy. The frequency range of interest for energetic elec-\ntrons in the inner magnetosphere is roughly 1\u201310 mHz, part\nof the ULF band. Diffusive transport will produce a net\nflow of electrons from regions of high phase-space density\nto lower density. If, as noted above, the phase space density\nis higher at geosynchronous than at L \u0001 4.5, then radial\ndiffusion will carry electrons inward, predominantly. Simple\nradial diffusion is less effective off the equator and at lower\nL, and does not result in any pitch angle scattering (which\nviolates the cyclotron and bounce invariants) [Falthammar,\n1968; Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974, pp. 89\u201390]. Therefore\nsimple radial diffusion should produce a pitch angle distri-\nbution that is peaked for equatorially mirroring particles,\nand should be progressively less effective at lower L (e.g.,\nproportional to L6 or higher order). Additionally, without\nbreaking the cyclotron invariant, >4 MeV electrons arriving\nat L \u0001 4.5 would have to have initial energies of >1 MeV in\na \u000130 nT field in the source region at L \u0001 10. Recently, a\nform of enhanced radial diffusion has been suggested in\nwhich the asymmetry of the magnetic field in the inner\nmagnetosphere allows more wave modes to act, with\ngreater effect, on the energetic electrons [Hudson et al.,\n1999, 2000, 2001; Elkington et al., 1999, 2003]. This\nmechanism has been shown to be successful in modeling\nseveral energetic electron enhancements. However, because\nof the strong L dependence of radial diffusion and stronger\nlosses at lower L, doubts have been expressed as to whether\nit can be effective far inside of geosynchronous orbit (R. M.\nThorne et al., manuscript in preparation, 2003). Also, some\ncase studies have found that radial diffusion is unable to\nreproduce the observed behavior of the radiation belts\nduring selected storms [Brautigam and Albert, 2000;\nMiyoshi et al., 2003]. The questions then that cast doubt\non radial diffusion models are: What is the source popula-\ntion, and can radial diffusion transport particles efficiently\nenough to low L?\n[14] Another acceleration model that relies completely on\nULF waves is the global recirculation model. Fujimoto and\nNishida [1990] suggested that ULF waves give rise not only\nto radial transport near the magnetic equator, but also to fast,\nelastic radial scattering at low altitudes. In this scenario\nelectrons are continually scattered to higher L at low\naltitudes to be brought in again, and energized again, by\nradial diffusion near the equatorial plane. Considerable\ndoubt persists as to whether the low-altitude phase of this\nrecirculation process actually occurs. If it does occur, global\nrecirculation should produce electron pitch angle distribu-\ntions with an apparent source of particles near the loss cone\n(field aligned).\n[15] Summers and Ma [2000b] suggested that ULF waves\ncould accelerate electrons by violating the adiabatic invari-\nant associated with electron cyclotron motion. When the\nbounce motion of an electron carries it through a ULF wave,\nthe ULF wave can appear, by Doppler shift, to have a\nfrequency resonant with the cyclotron frequency of the\nelectron. This resonant interaction allows an electron and\nULF wave to exchange energy, violating all three of the\nelectron\u2019s adiabatic invariants, and possibly energizing the\nelectron while damping the wave. Aside from the original\nanalysis by Summers and Ma [2000b], this mechanism has\nnot received further treatment in the literature.\n[16] Considerable theoretical research has been done on\npotential acceleration (or heating) of energetic electrons by\nVLF\/ELF waves [Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers et al.,\n1998, 2001; Roth et al., 1999; Summers and Ma, 2000a].\nWaves with frequencies that can be Doppler shifted to be\nnear the electron gyrofrequency can readily interact with the\ncyclotron motion of trapped electrons. These waves come in\nmany varieties: electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves\n(EMIC), whistler mode chorus, and auroral kilometric\nradiation (AKR), to name a few. In a comprehensive\ntreatment, Summers et al. [1998] suggested that dusk-side\nEMIC waves at the plasmapause could isotropize energetic\nelectrons, while dawn-side chorus energized and anisotrop-\nized the same electrons. This two-phase, longitudinal recir-\nculation process would lead to nearly isotropic pitch angle\ndistributions, with strong precipitation on the dusk side and\nslight anisotropy on the dawn side.\n[17] Several recent studies have reported an association\nbetween relativistic electron flux enhancements and en-\nhanced chorus amplitudes [Meredith et al., 2002a; Miyoshi\net al., 2003; Meredith et al., 2003]. Further evidence for\nelectron acceleration to relativistic energies driven by\nwhistler mode chorus has come from detailed studies of\nthe 9 October 1990 geomagnetic storm. Meredith et al.\n[2002b] demonstrated that the observed spectral hardening\nFigure 1.

Also plotted are the function Lmax\nfrom Tverskaya et al. [2002] and a scaled plasmapause\nmodel Lpp from O\u2019Brien and Moldwin [2002].\nO\u2019BRIEN ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRONS AND VLF AND ULF WAVES SMP 11 - 3\ntook place over a range of energies appropriate to the\nresonant energies associated with Doppler-shifted cyclo-\ntron resonance. Horne et al. [2003] observed flat-topped\npitch angle distributions from L \u0001 4\u20136 during the recov-\nery phase of this storm, providing further evidence for\nchorus-driven acceleration. Summers et al. [2002] devel-\noped a model kinetic equation for the electron distribution\nand, using realistic wave and particle data from the\nCRRES spacecraft for this storm, were able to successfully\nreproduce the observed spectral hardening seen at L \u0001 4.\n[18] The electron distribution in velocity space is such\nthat lower-band chorus, 10\u201350% of the electron gyrofre-\nquency, can gain energy from lower energy (hundreds of\nkeV) electrons near the loss cone while energizing MeV\nelectrons closer to 90 degrees [Meredith et al., 2002b;\nHorne et al., 2003]. This local acceleration mechanism\nwould be most effective near the plasmapause, and would\nnot involve substantial radial transport. The energization is\nachieved diffusively in the presence of a phase-space\ngradient, producing net transport toward higher energy\nand 90 degree pitch angles along diffusion surfaces. The\nchorus interaction would be strongest near the plasmapause,\nwhere a local minimum in the ratio of the electron plasma to\ncyclotron frequencies coincides with strong lower-band\nchorus. Additionally, off-equatorial interactions between\nchorus and MeV electrons might produce microbursts\n[Horne and Thorne, 2003].\n[19] Some authors have suggested hybrid acceleration\nmechanisms that involve both ULF and VLF waves playing\ncomplementary roles. A localized recirculation model has\nbeen suggested by Boscher et al. [2000]. In this model,\nradial diffusion transports particles inward at the equator\nand outward at higher latitudes, while plasmaspheric hiss\nprovides pitch angle scattering inside the plasmapause. Near\nthe plasmapause, electrons can locally recirculate many\ntimes, gaining energy with each cycle. Along these same\nlines, Liu et al. [1999] suggested a recirculation mechanism\nwhere radial diffusion by ULF waves and an unspecified\npitch angle scattering mechanism (possibly whistler mode\nVLF waves) produced diffusion in energy space away from\nlow energies. However, without specification of the crucial\npitch angle scattering mechanism, this acceleration cannot\nyet be evaluated empirically.\n[20] There are clearly a variety of electron acceleration\nmechanisms available, and nature tends to produce what-\never is not forbidden. Nonetheless, some acceleration\nmechanisms are likely to be more important than others.\nIn the following sections, we will provide observational\nevidence in an attempt to prioritize the available accelera-\ntion mechanisms, especially with regard to relative impor-\ntance of ULF and VLF\/ELF waves.\n2. ULF Wave Observations\n[21] Many recent observations have highlighted the as-\nsociation between ULF waves and energetic electrons,\nparticularly at geosynchronous altitude. Consistent with\nthe correlation between energetic electrons and high solar\nwind velocity, ULF waves can be generated by a Kelvin-\nHelmholtz shear flow instability across the magnetopause\nwhen magnetosheath (and therefore solar wind) velocity is\nsufficiently high [Pu and Kivelson, 1983; Engebretson et\nal., 1998; Mann et al., 1999; Mathie and Mann, 2000b, and\nreferences therein]. Rostoker et al. [1998] found that MeV\nelectron fluxes at geosynchronous were well correlated with\nULF wave power over a 90-day interval in 1994. Baker et\nal. [1998b] provided an event study in which ULF power\nappeared to be associated with the enhancement of MeV\nelectron fluxes in the outer belt. Baker et al. [1998a]\ncompared two storms and concluded that the electron\naccelerator involved ULF pulsations accelerating a seed\npopulation injected by substorms. Superposed epoch anal-\nyses have shown that magnetic storms resulting in high\nenergetic electron fluxes tend to have sustained ULF power\nduring the recovery phase [Mathie and Mann, 2000a;\nO\u2019Brien et al., 2001a; Green and Kivelson, 2001].\n[22] We have analyzed ULF power (1\u201310 mHz) from the\nSAMNET (recording in magnetic H, D, and Z coordinates)\nand IMAGE (recording in geographic X, Y, and Z coor-\ndinates) magnetometer arrays [Yeoman et al., 1990; Viljanen\nand Hakkinen, 1997] for 1987\u20132001. We have calculated\nthe ULF power in all three magnetic components at several\nstations ranging in L from \u00012.6 to \u00016.9, given in Table 1.\nThe time resolution of the data varies from 5\u201320 s over the\nhistory of the database. We measure ULF power in a 2-hour\nwindow centered on each hour of magnetic local time\n(MLT). We taper with a normalized Hanning window and\napply a discrete Fourier transform. We then sum, for each\ncomponent, the squared amplitude in the 1\u201310 mHz band.\nOur analysis only measures the spectral power in the\nspecified frequency range. Because radial diffusion pro-\nceeds regardless of whether the wave power is narrowband\n(wave-like) or broadband (trend-like) [Falthammar, 1968;\nElkington et al., 2003], we have made no distinction in our\ndata.\n[23] We begin with a characterization of ULF power as a\nfunction of L and MLT. In Figure 2 we show ULF power\nconditioned by Dst and solar wind velocity (Vsw). (Inter-\nplanetary data are taken from the Omni database [King and\nPapitashvili, 1994].) At low solar wind velocity or weak\nDst, ULF power is strongest on the night side at high L,\nwith the peak moving to the day side at lower L. With\nhigher solar wind velocity, the ULF power increases in\ngeneral, while spreading away from midnight and to lower\nL. For active Dst, the enhancement is even stronger. Similar\nresults for the dawn sector power have been found in\nprevious studies [e.g., Mathie and Mann, 2000b, 2001].\n[24] To determine the association between ULF power\nand energetic electrons, we perform a superposed epoch\nanalysis following an algorithm similar to that of O\u2019Brien\net al. [2001a]. We have calculated a composite hourly noon\nelectron flux from 1989\u20132001 for the 1.8\u20133.5 MeV\nelectron channel on board Los Alamos National Laboratory\ngeosynchronous satellites, using the statistical local time\nmapping algorithm described by O\u2019Brien et al. [2001b]. We\nfirst identify magnetic storms in the interval 1989 through\n2001 using Dst, requiring a Dst below \u000550 nT, with storm\nminima separated by at least 4 days. We then break these\nstorms into two categories based on the composite noon\nelectron flux at GEO (L \u0001 6.6) averaged 48\u201372 hours\nafter minimum Dst. Storms with average poststorm flux\ngreater than 0.5 cm\u00052s\u00051sr\u00051keV\u00051 are classified as\n\u2018\u2018events\u2019\u2019; storms with average poststorm flux less than\n0.5 cm\u00052s\u00051sr\u00051keV\u00051 are classified as \u2018\u2018nonevents.\u2019\u2019 The\nSMP 11 - 4 O\u2019BRIEN ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRONS AND VLF AND ULF WAVES\nthreshold of 0.5 cm\u00052s\u00051sr\u00051keV\u00051 was chosen because it\ndivides the storms into categories of approximately equal\nsize. We have also considered categorization based on the\nratio of poststorm flux to prestorm flux. The ratio method\nhas two major problems that caused us to reject it: (1) it\nproduces very dissimilar prestorm distributions of flux in\nthe two categories, with \u2018\u2018events\u2019\u2019 typically having low\nprestorm flux, and \u2018\u2018nonevents\u2019\u2019 having high prestorm flux;\nand (2) the ratio method does not organize geophysical\nparameters, such as solar wind velocity, ULF power, and\nmicroburst frequency, as well as the poststorm flux thresh-\nold method. Essentially, our results rely on the fact that\nprestorm and poststorm fluxes are uncorrelated at geosyn-\nchronous orbit [Reeves et al., 2003]. Our analysis implicitly\nassumes that nearly all electrons at geosynchronous are lost\nduring the main phase of every storm, and the poststorm\nflux is determined entirely by the balance of acceleration\nand loss during the recovery phase.\n[25] For each hour relative to the time of minimum Dst\n(epoch time zero), we obtain the distribution of each\nobservable quantity in the two categories. For univariate\ntime series (e.g., Dst or noon composite electron flux at\nGEO), we calculate the median and upper and lower\nquartiles of these distributions. For bivariate quantities,\nsuch as morning sector ULF wave power in the X or H\ncomponent, we calculate the median power at each L (each\nstation) by grouping the observations into four MLT sectors:\npredawn (00\u201306), morning (06\u201312), afternoon (12\u201318),\nand premidnight (18\u201324). Because each station can only be\nat one local time at any given time, we effectively have ULF\nmeasurements in each local time for one quarter of the\nstorms. In Figure 3, we depict the evolution of X\/H\ncomponent ULF power and electron flux as a function of\nepoch time relative to minimum Dst for events and non-\nevents. We note that the Dst distributions are quite similar in\nthe events and nonevents, with Dst recovering somewhat\nmore slowly in events. This suggests that the magnetic field\ntopology is likely (but by no means guaranteed) to be\nsimilar in the two sets of storms. For comparison with the\ngeosynchronous data, we have also provided >1.5 MeV\ntrapped fluxes at L \u0001 4.5 from HEO1 (1994\u2013026) (for\ninstrument description, see Blake et al. [1997]). The elec-\ntrons at L \u0001 4.5 show a similar response to those at GEO\nduring the recovery phase, indicating that the response is\nlinked across L shells, as suggested by Kanekal et al.\n[2001]. We also notice that ULF power increases strongly\nwith L in both categories of storms, regardless of local time\nsector, consistent with previous observations that ULF\npower increases with L [e.g., Mathie and Mann, 2001].\nAdditionally, in events and nonevents there is a burst of\nULF power near minimum Dst in all sectors, with power\nstronger at higher L on the night side, consistent with\nFigure 2. Finally, we notice that the ULF power is much\nstronger in the events than in the nonevents, especially in\nthe recovery phase. This reinforces what has been observed\nbefore [Mathie and Mann, 2000a; O\u2019Brien et al., 2001a;\nGreen and Kivelson, 2001], suggesting that ULF waves\nplay an important role in accelerating energetic electrons,\nparticularly near geosynchronous orbit. In the next section\nwe will examine whistler mode chorus, another wave band\nimplicated in electron acceleration.\n3. VLF\/ELF Chorus Observations\n[26] In a recent study, Meredith et al. [2001] sought to\ncharacterize the spatial dependence of chorus amplitudes as\na function of substorm activity (as measured by AE) using\nCRRES in situ observations. They analyzed chorus ampli-\ntudes as a function of AE, band, magnetic latitude, L, and\nlocal time. They found that for AE > 300 nT, lower-band\nchorus (10\u201350% of the electron gyrofrequency) was excited\nbeyond the nominal plasmapause and across the dawn side\nover a wide range of magnetic latitudes. (It should be noted\nthat in some regions the lower-band chorus extends into the\nnominal ELF range, and therefore it is not strictly a VLF\nphenomenon, although it is often referred to as such in the\nliterature). An example of the distribution of chorus waves\nis shown in Figure 4, which depicts the average equatorial\nlower-band chorus amplitude for Kp \u0001 4\u20136 observed by\nCRRES. The equatorial region was defined as magnetic\nlatitudes up to 15 degrees on either side of the magnetic\nequator. The CRRES spacecraft orbited for 15 months in\n1990\u20131991, in a nearly equatorial geotransfer orbit with an\nTable 1.

The wave amplitudes in Figure 4\nwere derived from the Plasma Wave Experiment [Anderson\net al., 1992] from 939 CRRES orbits. For more information\non the processing see Meredith et al. [2001]. It is clear in\nFigure 4, as was seen in the Meredith et al. [2001] study,\nthat chorus activity is strongest on the dawn side, beyond\nthe plasmapause. This is consistent with a model of chorus\nexcited by substorm injection of 10\u2013300 keV electrons,\nwhich are unstable to generation of chorus in the low-\ndensity region beyond the plasmapause.\n4. Microburst Observations\n[27] A number of researchers have reported \u00011-s bursts\nof energetic electron precipitation (microbursts) in low-\naltitude observations from polar orbiting spacecraft [e.g.,\nFigure 3. Superposed epoch depiction of electron flux, Dst and X\/H ULF power for events and\nnonevents (see text). Thin red (blue) traces indicate the median at each epoch time for events (nonevents).\nThick traces indicate the upper and lower quartiles. The color scale indicates median ULF power.\nNumbers in brackets indicate the number of storms in each category.\nSMP 11 - 6 O\u2019BRIEN ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRONS AND VLF AND ULF WAVES\nBrown and Stone, 1972; Imhoff et al., 1992]. Recent\nresearch using data from SAMPEX has added extensively\nto this body of work [Blake et al., 1996; Nakamura et al.,\n1995, 2000; Lyons et al., 1999; Lorentzen et al., 2001a,\n2001b]. We will first review briefly the results for subrela-\ntivistic microbursts followed by more recent results for\nrelativistic microbursts.\n[28] It is well established that subrelativistic microbursts\nare accompanied by chorus, although chorus can occur\nwithout generating microbursts [Oliven and Gurnett,\n1968; Parks, 1978; Rosenberg et al., 1981, 1990; Roeder\net al., 1985; Torkar et al., 1987]. For electrons with energy\nof \u0001100 keV, cyclotron resonant interactions with chorus\ncan readily occur near the magnetic equator, with resonant\nenergy increasing off the equator. In fact, it is likely that\n10\u2013100 keVelectrons are intimately associated with chorus.\nTsurutani and Smith [1977] presented a picture of chorus\ngeneration in which substorms inject 10\u2013100 keV electrons\non the night side which subsequently convect around the\ndawn side. Because the magnetic field is not a perfect dipole\nand electrons with different pitch angles drift at different\nrates, substantial pitch angle anisotropy develops. When\nfluxes and anisotropy are high enough, the electron distri-\nbution becomes unstable to wave growth [Kennel and\nPetschek, 1966]. Whistler waves are generated near and\nbelow the local electron cyclotron frequency, which falls in\nthe chorus band.\n[29] Recent studies of relativistic microbursts have in-\nvolved observations from the low-altitude, polar-orbiting\nSAMPEX mission. The Heavy Ion Large Telescope (HILT)\ninstrument, which measures >1 MeV electrons, is described\nby Klecker et al. [1993], and the SAMPEX spacecraft as a\nwhole is described by Baker et al. [1993]. Blake et al.\n[1996] showed that microbursts were often isotropic, but\noccurred over a range of L, indicating that they were not\nsimply the result of a breakdown of adiabatic motion at\nthe trapping boundary. By comparing conjugate passes,\nNakamura et al. [1995] argued that microbursts were\nshort-lived temporal structures rather than persistent spatial\nstructures. Using a combination of event and statistical\nstudies, Nakamura et al. [2000] showed an association\nbetween MeV microbursts and the dawnside plasmapause,\nsuggesting that they were caused by whistler mode waves\noutside the plasmapause. On the basis of an enhancement of\nmicrobursts during storm intervals, they suggested that the\nmicrobursts were a side effect of electron acceleration.\nLorentzen et al. [2001a] demonstrated that chorus was\nusually observed on the Polar spacecraft in conjunction\nwith MeV microbursts on SAMPEX. From theoretical\narguments, they demonstrated that a resonance between\nMeV electrons near the loss cone and chorus waves would\nrequire interaction at multiples of the gyrofrequency, inter-\naction off the equator, or interaction in regions of depleted\ndensities. However, it should be noted that their analysis\napplied only to electrons with pitch angles of 5 degrees; for\nthe same plasma and wave conditions, the first-order cyclo-\ntron resonance is possible for electrons with pitch angles\nfrom 75\u201387 degrees at the equator. Lorentzen et al. [2001b]\nreinforced the association of microbursts with magnetic\nactivity and the plasmapause while also calculating that\nthe microburst precipitation was capable of emptying the\nprestorm radiation belt. Because microbursts are associated\nwith magnetic activity and with chorus, they may be a side\neffect of the chorus heating mechanisms described above\n[Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers et al., 1998; Summers\nand Ma, 2000a; Summers et al., 2001]. One scenario that\nsatisfies the restrictions presented by Lorentzen et al.\n[2001a] has been suggested by Horne and Thorne [2003].\nIn their scenario, keV energy electrons near the equator\ngenerate chorus through a first-order cyclotron resonance,\nproducing keV microbursts as a side effect. As the chorus\nwave packet propagates away from the equator, it could\ninteract through the same first-order resonance with MeV\nelectrons near the loss cone at higher latitude, scattering\nsome of them into the loss cone and producing MeV\nmicrobursts. Combining this scenario with the earlier obser-\nvations by Lorentzen et al. [2001a], we assume that micro-\nburst occurrence frequency can be used as a proxy for the\ninteraction of chorus waves and energetic electrons.\n[30] We have identified microbursts in SAMPEX >1\nMeVelectron measurements from 1996\u20132001 in 0.25L bins\nfrom L \u0001 2\u20139. An L bin is considered to have microbursts if\nat any time during the SAMPEX pass through that L range a\nmicroburst is observed. Microbursts are defined as intervals\nwhen N100 \u0005 A500\u00f0 \u00de=\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u00fe A500\np\n> 10, where the N100 is the\nnumber of counts in 100 ms and A500 is the centered\nrunning average of N100 over five 100 ms intervals (i.e.,\n0.5 s). We chose this definition because it compromises\neffectively between a linear measure of burstiness (N-A) and\na logarithmic measure (N\/A). We determined that a linear\nmeasure is oversensitive for large N and a logarithmic\nmeasure is oversensitive for small A. We confirmed that\nour definition agrees well with visual inspection for both\nhigh and low flux conditions.\n[31] However, we must keep in mind some caveats re-\ngarding the microbursts as a proxy for chorus wave activity.\nThe association between MeV microbursts and VLF\/ELF\nchorus is not as well established as the relationship between\nkeV microbursts and chorus; we have used the MeV micro-\nbursts because the keV microburst measurements from\nSAMPEX\/HILT are not continuously available for multiple\nFigure 4. Average equatorial lower-band chorus ampli-\ntudes for Kp 4\u20136, observed by CRRES.\nO\u2019BRIEN ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRONS AND VLF AND ULF WAVES SMP 11 - 7\nyears in a consistent instrument mode. Additionally, we\ncannot measure microbursts well when fluxes are very low\nbecause of poor counting statistics and the resulting bias\ninherent in our detection algorithm. This might lead to an\nartificial correlation between high trapped fluxes and high\nmicroburst occurrence frequency. Conversely, in the limit of\nstrong pitch angle diffusion, the loss cone is full, and bursty\nenhanced precipitation signatures are masked by the strong\nprecipitation. In the data we have collected for this study, the\ncorrelation between microburst frequency and trapped flux\ncontent observed by HEO is small (<0.01) for hourly\naverages, and so we continue to use MeV microbursts as a\nproxy for chorus wave activity in spite of the caveats. We\nnote that using longer averages and time offsets results in\nstronger correlations, but such correlations are not evidence\nof a bias in the microburst detection algorithm.\n[32] We must also consider some limitations to the wave-\nparticle interaction between lower-band chorus and MeV\nelectrons. Lorentzen et al. [2001a] showed that MeV elec-\ntrons near the loss cone could only resonate with chorus off\nthe equator, at multiples of the gyrofrequency, or in regions\nof depleted density. The strong lower-band chorus waves\nobserved in the equatorial region on the dawn-side (see\nFigure 4) could interact with MeVelectrons in each or all of\nthese circumstances, especially as the waves propagate\naway from the equator. Indeed, inspection of the CRRES\nplasma wave data reveals that chorus waves are regularly\nobserved at frequencies below 10% of the electron gyrofre-\nquency at higher magnetic latitudes (15\u201330 degrees). We\ntherefore feel justified in using the MeV microbursts as a\nproxy for the interaction between chorus and energetic\nelectrons.\n[33] The first step in our analysis of the microburst data is\nto extend the work of our predecessors by describing the\ndistribution of MeV microbursts in MLT and L. Lyons et al.\n[1999] and Lorentzen et al. [2001a] showed that MeV\nmicrobursts were most common near midnight for low\nactivity (Kp = 2) and in the prenoon sector for higher\nactivity (Kp = 5\u20139). The midnight microbursts were qual-\nitatively different from those in the prenoon sector, in that\nthey were accompanied by fluctuations up to 30 s in\nduration [Nakamura et al., 2000]. Additionally, the MeV\nprenoon microbursts moved to lower L, in association with\nthe plasmapause and higher activity [Nakamura et al., 2000;\nLorentzen et al., 2001a, 2001b]. Lyons et al. [1999] also\nincluded an analysis of >150 keV microbursts observed by\nSAMPEX in 1993; keV microbursts were found to be more\ncommon than the MeV variety, and occurred at somewhat\nhigher L (although this may stem from a saturation bias at\nlow L in the lower energy). It should be noted that the\ndistribution of chorus depicted in Figure 4 agrees in L and\nlocal time with the distribution of MeV microbursts seen in\nprevious studies [Lyons et al., 1999; Nakamura et al., 2000;\nLorentzen et al., 2001a], as expected if the two are causally\nconnected. The L dependence exhibits a noteworthy excep-\ntion: microburst frequency drops off more quickly with\nincreasing L than does chorus amplitude. This drop-off may\narise from the fact that the wave-particle interaction is\nstrongest at the local minimum in the ratio of the electron\nplasma to cyclotron frequency just beyond the plasmapause,\nor it may simply be a result of the decreasing availability of\ntrapped electrons at higher L. Figure 5 also shows that\nmicroburst location evolves similarly with Dst as described\nabove for Kp: near midnight for weak activity, moving to\nthe prenoon sector and lower L for increased activity. We\nemphasize that the color scales are different for each panel\nof Figure 5, allowing greater contrast within each figure. As\nobserved for Kp, more activity in Dst tends to increase the\nmicroburst occurrence frequency. In the lower panels,\nFigure 5 shows that solar wind velocity Vsw between 500\nand 600 km\/s produces microbursts about 10 times more\nfrequently than does Vsw < 400 km\/s. However, Vsw does\nnot, by itself, control the location of microbursts in L. There\nis substantial qualitative agreement for L < 7 between\nFigures 5 and 2, which describe microbursts and ULF\npower, respectively. The fact that microbursts become more\ncommon during high solar wind velocity indicates that they\nmay explain part of the electron-Vsw relationship reported\nby Paulikas and Blake [1979], which has been previously\nattributed to ULF waves. In this scenario, higher solar wind\nvelocity drives stronger magnetic activity [e.g., McPherron,\n1998], which would enhance chorus as well as ULF wave\nactivity.\n[34] Next, we perform a superposed epoch analysis for\nthe microbursts in much the same way as we did above for\nULF waves. We use the same definition of events and\nnonevents; however, because our microburst data set only\ncovers 1996\u20132001, we have about one third as many storms\nand a partial representation of the solar cycle. Figure 6\nshows how MeV microbursts vary in occurrence frequency\nas a function of L and storm phase for four local time\nsectors. SAMPEX covers two local time sectors on any\ngiven orbit, so that the grouping into four local times halves\nthe effective sample sizes. In the predawn and morning\nsectors both events and nonevents show an enhancement in\nmicroburst frequency around the time of minimum Dst over\nL \u0001 4\u20135.5. In the events, this activity continues to be strong\nwhile rising to slightly higher L during the recovery phase.\nFigure 5. Microburst occurrence frequency as a function\nof L and MLT for activity levels defined by Dst and Vsw.\nSMP 11 - 8 O\u2019BRIEN ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRONS AND VLF AND ULF WAVES\nMicrobursts in the region of L \u0001 4.5\u20136 remain active in the\nmorning sector for several days following minimum Dst. As\nnoted above, during this same interval the events at GEO\ncoincide with considerably higher >1.5 MeV electron fluxes\nat L \u0001 4.5 than the nonevents at GEO. Therefore it is clear\nthat microbursts are associated with rising fluxes during the\nrecovery phase and are not merely a side effect of high flux\nlevels. It appears, then, that both microburst frequency and\nULF wave power are enhanced in the recovery phase of\nmagnetic storms that result in high MeVelectron fluxes both\nat GEO and at L \u0001 4.5.\n5. ULF and Microburst Comparison\n[35] If, as noted in the previous sections, electron\nevents are characterized by more microbursts and stronger\nFigure 6.

As a first\nstep, we have designed what should be a simple test for\nthis determination: we divide our magnetic storms into\nfour categories based on the level of ULF power and the\nfrequency of microbursts and compare the final MeV\nelectron fluxes at several L shells. Approximately half of\nour storms exhibit ULF power in the X component\naveraged over all 4 local time sectors at Sor\u00f8y\u00f8 (SOR)\nabove 2.2 \b 106 nT2\/Hz taken on the day (12\u201336 hours)\nafter minimum Dst. Similarly, approximately half of our\nstorms exhibit microburst probabilities above 2% aver-\naged over all L. The microburst probability threshold\nappears low because it is averaged over all L and MLT,\nand it therefore includes the very low probability regions\nat L \u0001 2 and L \u0001 9 and near dusk, as well as the high\nprobability region at L \u0001 4\u20136 near dawn. These two\nthresholds allow us to divide our magnetic storms into\nfour categories. In Figure 7 we depict the cumulative\ndistribution of electron flux 72 hours after minimum Dst\nat three locations in each of the four categories. A\ncumulative distribution function describes the fraction of\na sample that is less than the abscissa of the curve. At\nL \u0001 4.5, poststorm HEO1 fluxes are nicely ordered as\nfollows. Storms with neither strong ULF waves nor\nfrequent microbursts have the lowest distribution of\nfluxes; storms with only ULF waves or microbursts have\na somewhat higher distribution of fluxes; and storms with\nboth strong ULF waves and frequent microbursts produce\nthe highest poststorm fluxes at L \u0001 4.5. At geosynchro-\nnous the storms exhibiting only ULF power or both ULF\npower and microbursts have similar distributions. The\nstorms exhibiting only microbursts appear to result in\nmostly the same flux as the storms with ULF power, with\na greater chance of a low final flux. Again, the storms\nwith neither ULF power nor microbursts tend to result in\nlower fluxes than the other sets of storms. Finally, L \u0001\n5.5 gives an ordering between those at L \u0001 4.5 and\nGEO. Taken together, these results suggest that near L \u0001\n4.5, microbursts and ULF power are equally associated\nwith the final electron flux, whereas at geosynchronous\norbit ULF wave power is more closely associated with\nelectron acceleration.\n[36] A note of caution is warranted in the interpretation of\nFigure 7: while we have attempted to use the most sensible\ncriteria, different choices of the selection criteria allow the\nrelative location of the distributions to change somewhat.\nSuperposed epoch analyses have shown that the ULF power\ntoo close to minimum Dst is not correlated with the electron\nresponse [Mathie and Mann, 2000a; O\u2019Brien et al., 2001a;\nGreen and Kivelson, 2001], and the same is true for\nmicrobursts (see, e.g., Figure 6). Similarly, if the selection\ncriteria are moved too far after minimum Dst, the relevant\nactivity may have died away after acceleration of the\nelectrons. Therefore we have chosen for our analysis\ncategories based on ULF power and microbursts 12\u201336\nhours after minimum Dst. We have also performed the\ncumulative distribution analysis using only dawn ULF\npower. Such a change results in geosynchronous orbit,\nrather than L \u0001 4.5, being the location at which the storms\nwith only frequent microbursts or only high ULF power\nappear to have equivalent distributions of final flux. We\nhave presented the results for an average over all sectors\nbecause we feel that, in a radial diffusion scenario, the\nelectrons would respond to strong ULF power, regardless of\nits local time. We have also looked at the distribution of flux\nchange for storms in each category, rather than the post-\nstorm flux. While this slightly adjusts the distributions, it\ndoes not change the qualitative results. In all systems of\ncategorization we have tried, the response of relativistic\nelectrons tends to be more closely associated with ULF\npower at progressively higher L, and, conversely, it tends to\nbe more closely associated with microbursts at progressive-\nly lower L.\n6.

Both are strongest\nduring the main phase of storms, both progress to lower\nL during stronger magnetic activity, both continue to be\nactive during the recovery phase of events, and both appear\nto be more active during intervals of high solar wind\nvelocity. The main distinctions between the two appears\nto be their distribution in L and MLT, and, possibly as a\nconsequence, their association with poststorm flux at dif-\nferent L. We must, therefore combine the relatively small\nnumber of distinctions in the observations with theoretical\narguments if we are to make any distinction between the\nroles of ULF and VLF\/ELF waves in accelerating electrons\nto relativistic energies.\n[39] We have observed that (1) microbursts of isotropic\nprecipitation occur primarily on the dawn side, with great-\nest frequency near L \u0001 5 and outside the plasmapause, (2)\nULF wave power is stronger at higher L, and concentrated\non the night and dawn sides, (3) strong ULF waves or\nfrequent microbursts alone are associated with similar\nelectron response at L \u0001 4.5, while at higher L frequent\nmicrobursts alone are associated with a slightly weaker\nelectron response than are strong ULF waves alone, and (4)\nstrong ULF waves combined with frequent microbursts\ngive a somewhat stronger electron response at all L shells.\nWe are now faced with two competing explanations of the\nobservations. First is the \u2018\u2018loss only\u2019\u2019 explanation, in which\nmicrobursts are solely an indicator of loss. Second is the\n\u2018\u2018side effect\u2019\u2019 explanation, in which microbursts are a side\neffect of electron energization by chorus waves.\n[40] The \u2018\u2018loss only\u2019\u2019 explanation argues that the MeV\nmicrobursts are purely a signature of loss, and that they play\na role in shaping the L structure of the radiation belts only\nby carving away the electrons as they radially diffuse into\nthe region just beyond the plasmapause. In this scenario, the\nchorus interaction described in the literature [e.g., Horne\nand Thorne, 1998; Summers et al., 1998, 2001; Summers\nand Ma, 2000a; Meredith et al., 2001, 2002a, 2002b; Horne\net al., 2003] would result primarily in loss, rather than\nacceleration. A comprehensive treatment of the loss versus\nacceleration efficiency of the chorus interaction has not\nbeen performed and is beyond the scope of this paper.\nHowever, the distribution of electrons in velocity space\ntypically has gradients away from the loss cone and away\nfrom high energies [Meredith et al., 2002b; Horne et al.,\n2003]. In such cases, the diffusion curves for resonance with\nlower-band chorus waves allow particles with energies of\nhundreds of keV to give up energy to the waves while\ndiffusing into the loss cone, and simultaneously particles at\nMeV energies gain energy from the waves while diffusing\ntoward 90 degrees (see Figure 7 and Meredith et al.\n[2002b]). Also, the \u2018\u2018loss only\u2019\u2019 argument would require\nradial diffusion to be strongly effective in the vicinity of the\nplasmapause, a requirement likely inconsistent with the\ndrop-off in ULF wave power at lower L (as VswL in\nthe work of Mathie and Mann [2001]), and with the strong\nL dependence of radial diffusion (e.g., L6 in the work of\nFalthammar [1968] or L11 in the work of Elkington et al.\n[2002]). Finally, the distribution of electron flux after\nmicroburst-only storms shown in Figure 7 is not consistent\nwith their being only a loss process. We therefore conclude\nin favor of the \u2018\u2018side effect\u2019\u2019 explanation, in which MeV\nmicroburst precipitation is interpreted as a side effect of\nelectron acceleration by chorus.\n[41] The bottom portion of Figure 8 is a smoothed,\nqualitative representation of the dawn profile of microburst\noccurrence frequency and ULF power (both in arbitrary\nlinear scales). Arrows are drawn to indicate electron ener-\ngization (vertical) and transport (horizontal). We suggest\nthat in the vicinity of L \u0001 5, or perhaps at 1.3Lpp as\nindicated in Figure 1, chorus accelerates electrons without\ndisplacing them in L. Because the acceleration involves\npitch angle scattering, microbursts are observed frequently\nin this VLF\/ELF acceleration region. Closer to geosynchro-\nnous orbit, we suggest that ULF waves are more important,\non average pushing electrons inward and energizing them.\n[42] Since the microbursts appear to be caused by chorus\ninteractions with trapped electrons, and such interactions are\nthought to accelerate some electrons that are not scattered\nFigure 8. A composite sketch of electron acceleration.\n(top) The inner magnetosphere for Kp \u0001 4\u20136. (bottom) A\nschematic of how and where ULF and VLF\/ELF waves\naccelerate and transport electrons.\nO\u2019BRIEN ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRONS AND VLF AND ULF WAVES SMP 11 - 11\ninto the loss cone, we suggest that VLF\/ELF chorus plays a\nsignificant role in accelerating the electrons, as proposed by,\ne.g., Horne and Thorne [1998]. We feel that there is also\nample evidence that the radial diffusion and energization by\nULF waves suggested, e.g., by Elkington et al. [2002] takes\nplace in some form. Both ULF and VLF\/ELF activity will\ncontribute to electron acceleration throughout the outer\nzone, but ULF waves may play an increasingly dominant\nrole at larger L, in particular beyond geosynchronous orbit.\nWe make this distinction based on the fact that microburst\nactivity decreases with L, while lower-band chorus ampli-\ntudes for Kp \u0001 4\u20136 are relatively constant from the\nplasmapause to geosynchronous orbit and ULF amplitudes\nincrease dramatically with L in the outer zone. At this time,\nwe do not hypothesize any interaction between the ULF and\nchorus processes, which appear to overlap substantially in\nL, aside from noting that inward transport could help\nreplenish those electrons that are lost to the atmosphere\nthrough the chorus wave interaction.\n[43] It appears that during the recovery phase of electron\nevents, chorus activity at L \u0001 5 provides an inner magne-\ntospheric source of MeV electrons, while the plasma sheet\n(and possibly substorms or other electron injections) pro-\nvides a source of \u0001100 keV electrons at high L. Radial\ndiffusion driven by ULF waves can redistribute both of\nthese sources in L, filling the region between the plasma\nsheet and the plasmapause with trapped MeVelectrons from\nboth sources. Because radial diffusion is weak at low L, and\nULF power is also weak at low L, the interior portion of the\nMeV electron belt probably arises mostly from VLF\/ELF\nwaves and the outer portion probably arises from inward\ntransport from the plasma sheet. Since the interior portion of\nthe belt includes a source, it is the likely location of a peak\nin phase-space density, which could produce a peak in flux\nat constant energy. The location of the peak in the radiation\nbelts would be controlled by the VLF\/ELF acceleration\nregion, which appears to be excluded from the plasma-\nsphere. Stronger magnetic storms have smaller plasma-\nspheres [e.g., O\u2019Brien and Moldwin, 2003], and therefore\ndeeper penetration of the radiation belts, in keeping with the\nobservations of, e.g., Tverskaya et al. [2002].\n[44] Our observations suggest that the VLF\/ELF wave\ninteraction occurs over a range of L, outside of the\nplasmapause. This suggests that coupled VLF-ULF accel-\neration local to the plasmapause, such as that advanced by\nBoscher et al. [2000], is probably not the dominant accel-\neration mechanism at low L. However, if the pitch angle-\nscattering role of plasmaspheric hiss in their model is\nachieved instead by whistler chorus, then the localized\nrecirculation process may be active and important over\nthe appropriate range of L. This scenario would have the\nULF and VLF\/ELF interactions linked, which is somewhat\nless parsimonious than the scenario described above, in\nwhich the wave interactions are independent. Additionally,\nbased on Figure 7, it appears that either process alone can\nproduce an electron response.\n[45] We have several suggestions for further testing to\nfalsify or validate the combined acceleration scenario we\nhave suggested. First and foremost, attempts should be made\nto calculate correct phase-space density at a range of L\nvalues to determine whether there is evidence for a density\npeak in the vicinity of L \u0001 5 in the early recovery phase.\nSuch a peak would be consistent with a VLF\/ELF acceler-\nator. However, Selesnick and Blake [2000] showed that if the\nsource population is variable, loss processes at high L can\ncreate a phase-space density peak after radial diffusion has\nbrought new energetic electrons to the inner magnetosphere.\nTherefore it is necessary to observe carefully the temporal\nvariations of the phase-space density. Appropriate efforts are\nalready underway, including a study of several storms in\n1998 using Polar observations which suggests that there is a\nphase-space density peak at L \u0001 5 [Green, 2002]. Addition-\nally, further empirical and theoretical study of the waves and\nwave-particle interactions that cause microbursts would be\nhelpful, especially with regard to the relative efficiencies of\nacceleration and loss. Conjunction studies between low-\naltitude satellites like SAMPEX and higher altitude wave\ninstruments, like Polar or Cluster, following Lorentzen et al.\n[2001a], would be very helpful. CRRES only covers about\n15 months, and is therefore not sufficient for a comprehen-\nsive superposed epoch analysis of in situ waves; however, a\nstudy combining in situ ULF and VLF\/ELF waves from\nCRRES, AMPTE, and SCATHA missions might cover\nenough storms for a superposed epoch analysis for electron\nevents and nonevents, as shown here for ground-based ULF\nwaves. Finally, global numerical simulations, like the\nSalammbo code [Boscher et al., 2000], that can incorporate\nboth VLF\/ELF chorus and ULF wave-particle interactions\ncould put the two mechanisms into a global perspective.\nSuch simulations could be used to test the independence of\nthe accelerators, as we have suggested, or the coupling of\nthe accelerators suggested by Boscher et al. [2000]. Also,\nsuch models could be used to test whether the plasmapause\nlocation does, in fact, control the location of the peak\nintensity of the radiation belts.\n[46] Acknowledgments.
