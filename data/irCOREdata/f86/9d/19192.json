In Sri Lanka offi-\ncial records note that over 31,000 died, 4,000 were\nreported missing and over 1\/2 million people were dis-\nplaced consequently [2]. Many internally displaced peo-\nple (IDP) were housed in the 326 refugee camps scattered\nalong the coastline [3].\nIDP in a camp setting often have crude mortality rates (an\nindicator of health) at least twice that of their pre-dis-\nplaced baseline level [4]. Most morbidity and mortality is\ncaused by largely preventable and treatable diseases; diar-\nrhoeal diseases, respiratory tract infections, measles and\nmalaria account for 51\u201395% of all deaths [4-6]. However,\nmuch of the existing refugee health research has focused\non African war and famine refugees, the tsunami refugee\nsituation was an entirely different setting.\nTwo years on, many of the transitional camps constructed\nto house the IDP had been decommissioned, with the\noccupants living in permanent housing projects provided\nby the Sri Lankan government or non-government organ-\nizations (NGOs). However, over 14,000 families remain\nin transitional camps [7]. A typical transitional shelter is a\nsmall terraced one or two roomed wooden hut with a cor-\nrugated iron roof. The huts are poorly ventilated and have\nno chimney. The camps themselves are extremely\ncrowded and house between 100 and 1,500 people [8,9]\nwith communal water and sanitation facilities. In contrast\nthe purpose built concrete houses in the housing projects\nhave four to six rooms, including a cooking area with a\nchimney, a private toilet and often piped mains water and\na garden.\nHealth and housing\nThe relationship between the standard of housing and\nhealth has been recognized for over 150 years [10]. In\nstudies in developed countries, the presence of dampness\nand mould have been linked to a range of symptoms and\nillnesses including aches and pains, digestive disorders,\nand particularly to respiratory tract infections [11-13].\nOvercrowding is thought to increase vulnerability to com-\nmunicable diseases although it has proved difficult to\neliminate confounding factors [14,15].85% of Sri\nLankans rely on the burning of biomass (wood and coal)\nfor their domestic energy and this process has been linked\nto a wide range of respiratory diseases [16-18]. This may\nbe exacerbated by the lack of ventilation in the transi-\ntional camp housing.\nWhilst there is no literature that has focused specifically\non Sri Lankan IDP, four studies conducted in other devel-\noping countries provide relevant observations of the\nhealth effects of the slums of New Delhi [19], Palestinian\nrefugee camps [20,21] and housing in Bangkok [10]. Pop-\nulations in these studies have comparable living condi-\ntions and household densities to the transitional camps.\nGender and age were implicated as factors affecting symp-\ntom prevalence, both physical and mental [10,19,21].\nBoth the studies from Palestinian refugee camps found\nthat objective housing conditions, specifically crowding\n(number of people per room) and dampness, were related\nto health, particularly respiratory tract infections [20,21]\nIn contrast, Ruback and Pandy found in New Delhi that\nobjective measures of housing conditions related to a par-\nticipant's mental well-being but not physical health [19].\nWhile in Bangkok, Fuller, Edwards et al found that only\nself-perceived conditions, including crowding, were\nrelated to mental and physical health [10]. However dif-\nfering study designs make comparisons difficult.\nThis study describes the conditions in the transitional\ncamps and housing projects, and compares the health of\nthose still living in the camps to that of those who have\nbeen relocated to the housing projects. Residents of hous-\ning projects were used as a comparison because, pre-tsu-\nnami they originate from a similar socio-economic\nbackground as those in transitional shelters. The escalat-\ning conflict in the north east of Sri Lanka is currently dis-\nplacing thousands of people, making research on the\nconsequences of living in transitional camps in this region\ncrucial [22].\nMethods\nData for this study was collected in seven transitional\ncamps and five permanent housing projects in the Galle,\nPanadura and Kalutara districts of southwest Sri Lanka in\nFebruary and March 2007. Ethical approval for the study\nwas obtained from the South Birmingham Student Ethics\nCommittee in England and the Colombo Medical Faculty\nEthical Review Committee in Sri Lanka.\nStudy population\nAccess to the transitional camps was facilitated by Impakt\nAid, a Non Government Organisation (NGO) that pro-\nvides medical clinics to camps in the area. There are no\nexact figures on how many people are in each transitional\ncamp. The study recruited 20\u201325 participants from each\ncamp and 30 from each housing project. Each household\nin a transitional camp or housing project had a number.\nRandom number tables were used to select households,\nand all participants aged over 18 in the selected house-\nhold were invited to participate, after written informed\nconsent had been obtained. Using this method no more\nthan three participants were interviewed from any one\nhousehold. If an eligible individual was not present at the\nhouse at the time of visiting two further attempts werePage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC International Health and Human Rights 2009, 9:16 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-698X\/9\/16made to contact them. No incentives for participation\nwere offered.\nSurvey\nThe survey was conducted using a 74-item pre-piloted\nstructured questionnaire divided into: demographic infor-\nmation; housing and living conditions and current and\npre-tsunami health. The health section included a list of\nsymptoms a participant might have had in the last month.\nThese were identified from background research as associ-\nated with living conditions [10,11,13] and included;\ncoughs or wheezing, stomach ache, diarrhoea, head ache,\ngeneral aches and pains and feeling generally unwell.\nSymptoms were recorded in one of five boxes ranging\nfrom 'none of the time', to 'all the time', however for sta-\ntistical analysis this had to be converted to binary data.\nOverall health was assessed using a scale ranging from 1\n(very poor) to 5 (very good). The questionnaire was trans-\nlated with the help of a Singhalese-speaking doctor to\nensure the questions were given cultural sensitivity and\nrelevance. It was then independently back-translated. The\nquestionnaire was administered by two Sinhalese pre-\nintern doctors who were monitored to ensure compliance\nwith the study protocol by one of the authors.\nSample size and statistics\nPost hoc power calculations have indicated that the sam-\nple size of 303 provides 90% power (p < 0.05) for all the\nprimary outcomes (except diarrhoea). The data were dual\nentered and inconsistencies corrected. Simple tabulation\nwas used with non-parametric tests to investigate the sig-\nnificance of the differences in living conditions and health\nbetween residents of transitional camps and housing\nprojects. Using the Symptoms as dependent variables,\nunadjusted odds ratios for each explanatory variable were\ncalculated. Forward binary logistic regression was used to\ncalculate adjusted odds ratios for each symptom of living\nin a transitional camp relative to a housing project.\nAdjusted odds ratios were checked using backward binary\nlogistic regression.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nThe sample consisted of 303 individuals, 60.1% of which\nwere female. The mean age of the sample was 38 years.\nThere were no significant differences in household\nincome or unemployment rates between residents of the\ntransitional camps or housing projects. In both popula-\ntions the average monthly household income was signifi-\ncantly below the Sri Lankan national average of\nUS$186.45 and unemployment rates were higher than\nnational rates for men and women of 4.9 and 10.3 respec-\ntively [23,24]. The housing conditions in the transitional\ncamps were reported to differ considerably from those of\nthe housing projects. Significantly higher frequencies of\ndamp, mould and flooding were reported in the transi-\ntional camp homes and the presence of a private toilet\nand separate kitchen with a chimney in the housing\nproject homes. The study sample characteristics and hous-\ning conditions are summarised in Table 1.\nHousing, overall health and symptom prevalences\nThere were no significant differences between any of the\nseven transitional camps' mean overall health scores or\nsymptom prevalences, the same was true for the five hous-\ning project locations. Transitional camp and housing\nproject mean pre-tsunami overall health scores were not\nsignificantly different. However residents in transitional\ncamps rated their current health significantly lower than\nresidents in housing projects; p < 0.005 for men and p <\n0.001 for women. The prevalence of all reported symp-\ntoms excluding diarrhoea was significantly higher in the\ntransitional camps than the housing projects. Feeling gen-\nerally unwell was the most prevalent symptom and was\nreported by 64.9% of males and 83.8% of females in the\ntransitional camps compared to 39.1% and 50.6% of\nmales and females in the housing projects. Coughs, stom-\nach aches, headaches and general aches and pains were\nreported over twice as prevalent in the transitional camps.\n(Table 2).\nTable 3 shows adjusted risk factors for each symptom,\ncontrolling for age, gender, marital status and income, of\nliving in a transitional camp compared to a housing\nproject. Living in a transitional camp compared to a hous-\ning project was found to be a high and significant risk fac-\ntor for the following symptoms; (O.R. 95% C.I.); coughs\n3.53 (2.11\u20135.89), stomach ache 4.82 (2.19\u201310.82), head-\nache 5.20 (3.09\u20138.76), general aches and pains 6.44\n(3.67\u201311.33) and feeling generally unwell 2.28 (2.51\u2013\n7.29). See Table 3.\nDue to the high correlation between housing conditions\nand housing type, ie. transitional camp or housing\nproject, the data from the transitional camps had to be\nanalysed separately to determine which conditions of the\nenvironment were risk factors for the symptoms [25]. All\nthe independent variables were entered and the signifi-\ncant relationships are shown in Table 4. The only predic-\ntive factor was household population density, which was\na significant risk factor for stomach ache 1.40 (1.09\u20131.79)\nand headaches 1.33 (1.01\u20131.77). See Table 4\nDiscussion\nThis study shows the self-reported health of the IDP still\nliving in the transitional camps to be significantly worse\nin comparison to the IDP living in permanent housing\nprojects. These differences are present despite the limited\nvariation between demographic and socio-economic fac-\ntors of the two populations.Page 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC International Health and Human Rights 2009, 9:16 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-698X\/9\/16Table 1: Comparison of sample characteristics and housing condition between transitional camps and permanent housing project.\nDemographics Transitional camp (n = 156) Housing project (n = 147) P\nAge 37.0 (S.D. 11.8) 38.8 (S.D. 15.1) 0.76\nSex Male 37% (57) 44% (64) 0.21\nFemale 63% (99) 56% (83)\nMarital status Single 5.8% (9) 6.9% (10)\nMarried 80.5 (124) 85.5% (124) 0.17\nWidowed 11.0% (17) 7.6% (11)\nDivorced 2.6% (4) -\nMales that smoke tobacco 61.4% (35) 40.1% (26) 0.02\nMales that use alcohol Use 37.5% (21) 26.6% (17) 0.20\nHousehold level (means)\nMonthly income Rs 6921 (S.D. 3830) Rs 7356 (S.D. 3970) 0.34\nUnemployment rates Male 7% (4) 7.9% (8) 0.87\nFemale 82.8% (82) 80.7% (67) 0.85\nAdults 2.8 (S.D. 1.2) 2.7 (S.D. 1.1) 0.22\nChildren 1.4 (S.D. 1.0) 1.7 (S.D. 1.3) 0.093\nPeople\/room 3.4 (S.D. 1.5) 1.1 (0.4) <0.001\nHousing conditions\nLeaking house 48.7% (76) 53.7% (79) 0.38\nFlood when rains All of the time 5.1% (8) 0.7% (1)\nSome of the time 47.4% (74) 9% (13) <0.001\nNone of the time 47.4% (74) 90.3% (131)\nDamp Very 3.2% (5) 0\nQuite 59.0% (92) 17.2% (25) <0.001\nNone 37.8% (59) 59.5% (120)\nMould Very 5.1% (8) 0\nQuite 22.4% (35) 13.8% (20) 0.002\nNone 72.4% (113) 86.2% (125)\nCooking fuel Wood 61.3% (92) 81.9% (118)Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC International Health and Human Rights 2009, 9:16 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-698X\/9\/16Housing conditions and symptom prevalence\nResidents of transitional camps were more likely to report\nexperiencing all symptoms investigated, (excluding diar-\nrhoea) than those living in permanent housing. A possible\nincreased prevalence of viral infections in the transitional\ncamps could provide an explanation for the results. The\npoor housing conditions in the camps such as high house-\nhold density and communal services could compound\ntransmission of a viral factor. The lack of a chimney in any\nof households in the camps could account for the\nincreased prevalence of coughs among camp residents\n[20,21].

Low socio-economic status and\nslow socio-economic recovery following a natural disaster\n[28,29], as well as the transitional camps themselves [30],\nhave all been shown to be risk factors for poor psycholog-\nical health outcomes. Carballo, Heal & Hernandez, De\nSilva, and Fernando have commented that Sri Lankans\noften present with somatisation rather than classic west-\nern symptoms of psychological distress [31-33]. Thus, it is\npossible that psychological distress associated with living\nin a transitional camp could explain a proportion of the\nhigh prevalence of reported pain symptoms of the IDP liv-\ning there. This is supported by the association between\nenvironmental stressors and increased psychological dis-\ntress found by Ruback and Pandey [11]. However further\nresearch into the mental health of the IDP is required to\nsupport this hypothesis.\nFor the transitional camp data alone, household density\n(number of residents per room) was shown to be a risk\nfactor for reporting 'stomach aches' and 'headaches'. The\nassociation between household density and 'stomach\nache' could indicate a relationship between crowding and\nenteric illness. However, the prevalence of diarrhoea is\nlow, and in light of the high prevalence of other pain\nsymptoms in the transitional camps, it is possible that\ncrowding increases risk of head and stomach ache via a\nmechanism of increased stress. This significant effect of\nobjective crowding (household density) on either physi-\ncal or mental health self-reported outcomes is contrary to\nthe findings of Ruback and Pandey in slums of Delhi and\nof Fuller, Edwards et al in Bangkok (although both studies\nfound an association between perceived crowding and\npoorer mental health) [10,11]. In the Palestinian refugee\ncamps a significant relationship between household den-\nsity and poorer health was found, but neither headache\nnor stomach ache were investigated [12,13]. The tendency\nfor this population to somatise their psychological dis-\ntress combined with the high household density could\nsuggest that the association between objective crowding\nand reported physical symptoms in this study operated\nvia the influence of subjective crowding on mental dis-\ntress found by Ruback and Pandey and Fuller, Edwards et\nal [10,11,31,32].\nIndividuals reporting that their homes contained lots of\nmould were shown to have a significant risk of reporting\n'headaches'. However, previous studies investigating the\nhealth effects of domestic mould have not shown this\nrelationship [15,16], and due to the low number report-\ning 'lots' of mould mean the reliability of this finding is\nTable 3: Logistic regression estimates of adjusted risk factors of symptoms comparing transitional camps to housing projects.\nIndependent \nvariables\nDependant variables\nUnwell Cough Stomach ache Diarrhoea Headache General aches and \npains\nExp.

Other than population density, the results did not\nuncover which housing conditions of the transitional\ncamps predisposed an individual to suffer from any of the\nsymptoms. It is likely that this is due to the homogeneity\nof the conditions within the camps. Diarrhoea prevalence\nwas low in both groups which could be due to the adult\nage group of the sample.\nAge and gender\nIn line with previous studies, increasing age was found to\nbe a significant independent risk factor affecting reports of\n'general aches and pains' and 'feeling unwell' [11].\nWomen were found to be more at risk of reporting 'feeling\ngenerally unwell' and 'headaches' (the ratio of 2.7 found\nin this study being within the range of 1.1 and 3.1 found\nin other studies [26,34]. It has been shown that women\nare more likely to experience poor mental health after a\ndisaster [28], which may explain some of the increased\nself-perceived morbidity risk for women in this study.\nMethodological considerations\nAlthough the most appropriate method for this study, the\ncross sectional design does not allow for causal inference\nbetween housing and health. Attempts were made to min-\nimise selection bias by including all locations where\naccess could be provided, however this was not possible in\nall areas so generalisability may be limited. Due to the\nnature of patient-doctor interaction and health care utili-\nsation in this population it was not possible to obtain a\nreliable disease specific diagnosis for existing medical\nproblems from the participants for this study. Although\nthe reliability of subjective measures of health has often\nbeen debated, in epidemiological research self-perceived\nhealth has been shown to be a valid measure of morbidity\nand may even be superior to physician-assessed morbidity\nin a prognostic sense [35,36]. The survey may have\nencouraged the over reporting of specific symptoms, how-\never this should have been the same for both populations.\nRecall bias was minimised by using a recall period of one\nmonth which is acceptable in health interview surveys in\ndeveloping countries [37]. Due to the inherent recall bias\nin questioning pre-tsunami health, it can be concluded\nthat participants feel their health has deteriorated, but it\ncannot be assumed that the difference in pre and current\nhealth scores shows an actual difference in health. It is\nalso possible that the IDP in the transitional camps were\nmore likely to exaggerate their ill health and poor living\nconditions, while those living in housing projects were\nmore inclined to highlight the positive aspects of their\nhome and health.\nThis is the first study to investigate the housing conditions\nand health (self-reported or otherwise) of this population.\nTable 4: Logistic regression estimates of the risk factors of each symptom among residents of transitional camps.\nIndependent \nvariables\nDependant variables\nUnwell Cough Stomach ache Diarrhoea Headache General aches \nand pains\nExp. \n(B) (95% CI)\nExp. \n(B) (95% CI)\nExp. \n(B) (95% CI)\nExp. \n(B) (95% CI)\nExp. \n(B) (95% CI)\nExp.

The\nstudy had a 100% response rate among contacted partici-\npants and the data demonstrated internal consistency\nwith expected patterns in terms of sex and age. Whilst sim-\nilar studies have looked at one specific condition or a sin-\ngle overall health outcome, this study has examined a\nbroader range of self-reported symptoms and has shown\nthe risk factors of living in transitional camps to vary con-\nsiderably with the symptom.\nConclusion\nTwo years after the tsunami, people living in the transi-\ntional shelters are still disadvantaged and vulnerable. This\nstudy demonstrates that the IDP in the transitional camps\nperceive their health to be markedly poorer than those\nthat have been relocated. Levels of housing conditions\ndeemed unhealthy are considerably higher in transitional\ncamps than housing projects, and living in a transitional\ncamp seems to be a high risk factor for a number of symp-\ntoms. The very high odds ratios of reported pain symp-\ntoms, the post-disaster situation and this particular\npopulations' tendency to somatise, suggests that a propor-\ntion of the high prevalence rate is possibly due to psycho-\nlogical distress. On the basis of these findings greater\nemphasis needs to be put on moving people into housing\nprojects as soon as possible to ensure that their health and\nwell being is not further compromised. Further investiga-\ntion also needs to be conducted into the prevalence of\nspecific conditions, chronic diseases and mental health in\nthe transitional camps. A larger study using objective\nmeasures would provide resource allocators with the\ninformation required to most effectively provide interven-\ntions to improve the health of this population.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAT conceived the study, participated in the design, imple-\nmentation, analysis and helped draft the manuscript.
