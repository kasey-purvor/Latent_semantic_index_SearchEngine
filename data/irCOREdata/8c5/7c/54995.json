His current main \nresearch interests revolve around interpretative approaches to understanding marketing \npractice.  He has previously published in journals such as Marketing Intelligence and \nPlanning, European Business Review Marketing Review and Qualitative Research in \nMarketing, an International Journal. His commercial experience was gained in the UK \ndistributive trades. \n \nMichaela Ardley  \nMichaela is employed in a pedagogical administrative role with Children\u2019s Services in \nLincolnshire. Her responsibilities involve the management of educational resources and \nspecifically, the sourcing and production of materials for delivery in extracurricular activity.  \nAdditionally, she is a postgraduate student with the Open University studying Art History and \nis a freelance teacher of the subject. \n \n \n \n\u00a0 2\nI\u2019ll tell of the Magna Charta  \nAs were signed of the Baron\u2019s command\u2026 (Edgar) \nINTRODUCTION: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MAGNA CARTA  \nIt is clear that there is a growing interest in all aspects of heritage and the representation of \nhistory as something to be consumed (Misiura 2006; Fisher 2000; Babour and Turnbull \n2002). An example of this is represented by the Magna Carta. This famous medieval \ndocument is regarded today by many commentators as representing the cornerstone of civil \nliberties around the globe (West 2008; Breay 2002). Its  famous clause 39, that no one man \nshall be imprisoned without judgement of peers, or by the law of the land, is often quoted in \ncontemporary debates about civil liberties, the conduct of politics and controversial issues \nlike the antiterrorist laws (Bennett et al 2007). In recognition of the documents outstanding \nuniversal value the Magna Carta was awarded in July 2009 'Memory of the World' status by \nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. There are now only \nfour copies remaining in the world of this remarkable document (Breary 2002), one of which \nis owned by Lincoln Cathedral and displayed in Lincoln Castle UK. Such significance means \nthat organisations owning a copy recognize the need to make it accessible. Both Chronis \n(2005) and Goulding (1999) argue that marketing can play an important role  in bringing \nhistory and particular aspects of the past to people, through appropriate targeting and \npositioning strategies.  In relation to the Lincoln Magna Carta, this paper presents a critical \naccount of how the latter is being undertaken in relation to three target groups; the general \ntourist, the schools sector and the American market. Recommendations are made regarding \nthe need to adopt a more strategic approach to marketing, in order to benefit from the \nopportunities that are clearly available to such an important document. \n\u00a0 3\nData for this case has been obtained from a variety of sources, including books, web sites, \ndocuments, and observation. The latter was of the Lincoln Castle exhibition of the Magna \nCarta, where a series of qualitative field notes were taken (Marshall and Rossman 1999). \nAdditionally, a method based on phenomenology was used. Hackley (2003) points out that \nprimarily, the phenomenological researcher has to generate written accounts of experience as \ntheir data. In line with this, the other element of primary research used involved the \nconstruction of a series of open ended questions which were then given in the form of a \nquestionnaire, to an employee of Lincoln Cathedral closely associated with the Cathedral\u2019s \nMagna Carta marketing activity. The questionnaire was supplemented by a series of question \nand answer sessions, where some key issues from the questionnaire were developed. In \naccordance with Bradley (2007), the open ended questions were self completed by the \nrespondent. This enabled relatively full answers to be compiled in a situation where the \nrespondent was not encumbered by the constraints of a structured quantitative questionnaire. \nFrom the answers to the open questions and the subsequent discussions, a series of themes \nemerged which helped to form the basis of this paper.  \nBACKGROUND: THE LINCOLN MAGNA CARTA \nSo how did a very precious copy of The Magna Carta come to survive in Lincoln? The \nanswer to this starts in the 13th century. After King John\u2019s fruitless attempts to recapture \nNormandy for the English in 1214, he returned to home in defeat and was immediately \nexposed to opposition from those who had suffered from his obdurate rule. Rebellious barons \nforced him in 1215 to sign the Magna Carta. This document contains 63 clauses, most \nattempting to curtail the power of the king. Copies of the original document were quickly \nmade, and of these only a few now survive; one owned by  Lincoln Cathedral, one by  \nSalisbury Cathedral and two owned  by the British library. As a physical object, the Magna \nCarta might not be seen as much to look at (Danziger and Gillingham 2003). Each of the \n\u00a0 4\ncopies is on a modest looking vellum parchment. Copies are approximately A3 in size, \ncovered now in faded Latin, but as the latter authors note, these nearly perfect, eight hundred \nyear old documents are just as famous as any you would see in either a museum or a \nparliament anywhere in the world. \nFrom the time of the accession of King John\u2019s son, Henry III, Magna Carta was reissued in \nvarying forms throughout the years that followed and became a central part of English Law. \nLincoln\u2019s copy of the Magna Carta lay undisturbed and unrecognised among the extensive \nDean and Chapter archives until the early nineteenth century (Bennett et al 2007). In 1800, \nthe government established the Record Commission to ensure the preservation of official \narchives. In 1848, members of the Archaeological Institute visited Lincoln and recorded that \nthe Magna Carta had been framed and was hanging in the Chapter Clerk\u2019s office. In 1939, the \nBritish Government requested that Lincoln\u2019s Magna Carta be sent to the British Pavilion at \nthe New York World\u2019s Fair due to concerns about the war in Europe. The document stayed in \nthe United States for the duration of the conflict, being sent to the Library of Congress in \nWashington, D.C. Lincoln\u2019s Magna Carta returned to the Cathedral in 1947. Since then, with \nthe exception of the tours it has been on, the Magna Carta has been on view in Lincoln Castle \n(Bennett et al 2007).  \nMARKETING MAGNA CARTA: ORGANISATION AND STRATEGY ISSUES \nWhilst it is clear that the Cathedral undertakes some marketing activities in relation to the \nMagna Carta, these do not occur within the framework of a planned and deliberate strategy. \nGenerally, what marketing that does take place is carried out on the basis of an often ad hoc \nresponse to events. In the words of the respondent from the Cathedral who supplied answers \nto the research questions posed,  what marketing that does transpire, \u2018takes place on a wing \nand prayer\u2019. Missing from marketing activity are the sorts of factors normally associated with \n\u00a0 5\nstrategic thinking. These include a mission and a clear set of marketing goals, a situation \nanalysis, clearly defined marketing research activity, product development, and the \nestablishment of strategic performance criteria (Blythe 2009; Dibb and Simkin 1996). Whilst \nit is recognised that a prominent discourse which must occupy Cathedral management is a \nreligious one, with income and work often the result of philanthropic \u2018giving\u2019, the absence of \nstrategic thinking hampers activities that could produce a significant increase in revenue and \nmarket coverage for the document. A strategic analysis of other cathedrals, which in one \nsense might be seen as competitors, could be revealing. St Pauls in London, York and \nDurham Cathedrals, all have developed marketing activities, with the former of these \ndisplaying impressive results. To do more than merely survive, so as to prosper, Lincoln \nCathedral must have a marketing strategy, as well as a religious one.    \nWhilst no systematic analysis of each of the various target markets for the Lincoln Magna \nCarta has taken place, three groups have evolved over time. At Lincoln Cathedral, one key \nmarket has been traditionally represented by schools, which historically have often sent \npupils on visits. As a consequence of this centrality, the Cathedral has developed an \neducational department headed by a Chancellor. From this department, the Magna Carta\u2019s \nmarketing efforts have been carried out, to include touring the Magna Carta in America, and \nin conjunction with Lincoln Castle, exhibiting the document locally to the general tourist \nmarket. These represent the three markets currently served by the Magna Carta. Potentially, \nthere exists considerable scope to expand the appeal of the Magna Carta to each of these and \nto increase the amount of income from them. In terms of marketing management, the \nChancellor of the Catherdal is a residentiary Canon, largely without any formal business \ntraining or expertise, who has a very small team of full time and part time workers, assisted \nby a group of volunteers. Most employed staff, with the exception of one, lacks any business \nor marketing qualifications or extensive experience. This lack of professionalism needs \n\u00a0 6\naddressing if future marketing efforts are too be successful. Volunteers represent an addition \nto the work force. A key aspect of the Chancellor\u2019s role is to provide an integrated \nprogramme of educational outreach for schools, and also lead the Cathedral\u2019s work with \nvisitors, both tourists and pilgrims. Clearly then, a problem here is that the particular \nexpertise and focus of the Chancellor is theological, while at the same time, the role \nincumbent must take on board a marketing orientation and the implementation of a marketing \nstrategy in relation to the Magna Carta. \nTHE LINCOLN MAGNA CARTA AS A HERITAGE BRAND \nA key aspect of the Magna Carta\u2019s brand identity clearly relates to its symbolic character. In \nterms of schools, the general visitor and the American market, one aspect of its marketing is \nto have it positioned as possessing iconic significance, reflecting its wider perceived role both \nhistorically and contemporarily. This feature of the Magna Carta brand sees it is as helping to \nforge a collective and individual identity for a modern society. A study involving the \nmeanings that visitors attached to three central memorial sites in Washington D.C. (Goldman \net. al. 2001) is illuminating in this respect. Interpretative based findings from the Goldman \nstudy noted that the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial prompted in respondents a desire to be engaged in a democratic civil \nsociety and the acceptance that the memorials represented ideals to try and strive for. At the \nCathedral, the education department currently positions the Magna Carta not only as an \ninteresting medieval artefact but also as a document that is symbolically representative of the \nissues facing the world and individual citizens. These issues include the pursuit of \ndemocracy, religious and human rights, freedom of speech, and the pursuit of justice. To \nthese two positioning bases can be added a third, the result of exposure in the American \n\u00a0 7\nMarket, where the Magna Carta is marketed so that it is primarily seen as an inspirer of the \nAmerican political system.  \nAs Misuira (2006) notes, particular symbolic ideas are created and embedded in various \nforms of heritage brands, but the problem here is that the Cathedrals policy is  questionable  \nin terms of assuming  that all target groups can relate successfully to current positioning \npolicy. Market research could help firstly in establishing what consumers find appealing \nabout the Magna Carta and then around this appropriate marketing programs could be built. \nAdditionally, issues relating to brand equity, covering such things as brand awareness, brand \nimage and brand associations (Aaker and Joachimsthaler 2002; Keller et al 2008) need to be \nmonitored and evaluated. Another problem is that as well as having strong symbolic \nelements, the Magna Carta as a product has both physical and functional aspects attached to it \nwhich are being neglected. In terms of tangibility, little thought has been given to the \navailability of complementary goods and services that can be sold alongside the display of the \nMagna Carta. An example of the nature of the Cathedral\u2019s largely reactive marketing \nprogram relates to promotion. In the United Kingdom, the status of The Magna Carta as an \nobject of national identity has been assisted  by its inclusion on the ICONS website (see \nICONS: a portrait of England, 2009). This is a site set up to promote a wide variety of \nnational icons. The parent organisation of ICONS is Culture 24, (Culture 24, 2009).  The \nroles of these organisations are to collect, interpret and promote culture to meet the demands \nof a wide-ranging audience. ICONS  is in essence a virtual museum that uses the latest digital \ntechnology to interact with audiences. With over half a million visitors each month to these \nsites, they provide a useful supportive promotional tool for the Magna Carta, crossing a \nvariety of market segments. Lincoln Cathedral played no part however in putting the Magna \nCarta up on the site and whilst serendipity has some role to play in marketing (Brown 2005; \n2008), it is certainly not the basis for a longer term strategic approach.  \n\u00a0 8\nTHE MAGNA CARTA AND THE GENERAL TOURIST \nThe general tourist market for the Lincoln Magna Carta is probably the most wide ranging \nsegment of the three targeted and can include visitors from abroad and home, including \ngroups as well as individuals. These variables can of course cover significant differences in \nterms of age, income, and background, but various studies have shown that common factors \nexist between visitors in terms of visits to heritage attractions, for example nostalgia, \nauthenticity and the desire for knowledge (Belk1997; Masberg and Silverman 1996; \nGoulding 1999; 2000).  When it is not in the United States on tour, the Magna Carta is sited \nin Lincoln Castle, the latter owned and maintained by Lincolnshire County Council, where it \ncan be viewed by the general tourist. The actual viewing of the Magna Carta itself is included \nas part of the entrance price to Lincoln Castle. It is possible to purchase a joint ticket from \nboth the latter and also the Cathedral, which includes dual entrance. Prices are fixed in terms \nof making a contribution to costs, but little research has been conducted on consumer \nperceptions and the possibility of a more market based approach being adopted. \nAs part of some recent efforts to improve the marketing of Magna Carta, a refurbished \nexhibition has been put in place in the Castle grounds. In the \u2018First Charters of Liberty\u2019 \nexhibition, alongside the Magna Carta there is the also the Charta of the Forest on display. \nThe latter document is important in its own right, being one of only two surviving copies, \ndating back to 1217. The Charta of the Forest dealt with the rights of the common people to \nbe granted proper subsistence in the forests of the King (Linebaugh 2008). Currently, both \nthese two documents are housed in the old prison of the castle, and do not in any way provide \nan ideal exhibition or visitors area. This is a small, relatively cramped and dingy building that \nthe visitor can pass through quite quickly, with an adjacent basic caf\u00e9. In the first part of this \nexhibition, a few artefacts from the time of Magna Carta and the Charta of the Forest are \npresent, along with some fairly simple and inexpensively constructed display boards of \n\u00a0 9\ninformation about the 13th century. There is some detail here about crime and punishment, \nfeudalism and the life of the common people and the revolt which resulted in the signing of \nMagna Carta at Runnymede. Next is a basic interactive board game which encourages  \nvisitors, particularly children,  to construct their own version of the hierarchical social order \nof the 13th century, and  it is possible to  also make a wax  \u2018King\u2019s seal\u2019.   \nThe second part of the exhibition contains displays and features reflecting the desire to \nmarket that Magna Carta not just a historical document, but having relevance for people\u2019s \nlives today. One part of an interactive game for children asks them to identify from \nillustrations, detainees who are not being fairly treated at the Guantanamo Bay\u00a0prison camp. \nThere is a \u2018have your say\u2019 section, where visitors can post their own comments on things like \nthe Stop and Search and Anti Terrorist Law. Additionally, information boards tell visitors \nthat there are clauses of the Magna Carta that are embedded in UK law today. Other \ninformation panels discuss the relevance of the Magna Carta across the contemporary world. \nAdditionally, produced by the Cathedral education department are two promotional leaflets \nthat try to reinforce the marketing message that the Magna Carta is not only of historical \ninterest, but has contemporary relevance.  One is a question and answer based leaflet (Lincoln \nCathedral 2008a), while the other (Lincoln Cathedral 2008b) juxtaposes a picture of the \nancient document with statements about its bearing on current issues of democracy and \nfreedom. The Magna Carta is being marketed here as both medieval artefact and a document \nfor contemporary society, but neither objective is given sufficient resources in the small \nexhibition area and the visitor might well leave with a confused view.  The actual centre \npiece and culmination of the exhibition is where the Lincoln Magna Carta is featured \nalongside the Charta of the Forest. Nowhere else in the world can these two inextricably \nlinked and important historical documents be seen together (City of Lincoln Council 2009). \nThe problem is that these documents are on view in a small cheaply decorated room with a \n\u00a0 10\nvague medieval theme that fails to capture the historical significance of both Chartas.  Whilst \nvisitors are coming face to face with authentic historical artefacts, a feature valued by many \nwho spend time at heritage exhibitions (Goulding 2000), the unimaginative environment does \nnot do justice to these rare documents. There is little further information available and there is \nno new digital technology anywhere in the exhibition that could enhance the visitor \nexperience, apart from temperature monitored, vacuum sealed display cases for the \ndocuments.   \nAlthough there are small shops in both the Cathedral and the Castle, what is conspicuously \nlacking in these outlets is any attempt to sell a range of goods, apart from one book produced \nby the Cathedral that complements the Magna Carta. In this sense, a major revenue \ngenerating opportunity is being lost. It is unusual for customers not too expect to find \nproducts available that relate to the historical artefacts they have seen (Misiura 2006). At the \ntime of viewing, even the Magna Carta book was not available in the exhibition area. Types \nof merchandise that could be sold include Magna Carta pens, jewellery, book markers, further \nbooks, ties and scarves, coasters, pictures and replicas of the document. On a positive point, \nin terms of promotion, the Cathedral website, (see www.lincolncathedral.com), does \nprominently feature the Magna Carta. Information about the Magna Carta features in two \nsections of the site \u2018Living and Learning\u2019 and \u2018Visits and Events\u2019 Not only is the history of \nthe Magna Carta outlined, but its relationship to modern issues is covered, along with lists of \nfurther resources that can be pursued and studied. The site is colourful, easy to navigate, \ncombining text and creative illustrations effectively. Additional interactivity is built into the \nweb site where visitors are asked to send in their views on the Magna Carta via email. \nImportantly, the Lincoln Cathedral web site with its Magna Carta elements does well in terms \nof search engine optimisation. Wikipedia\u2019s article on the Magna Carta comes at the top of the \norganic listings on Google and a quick scroll down the page to \u2018copies\u2019 has a link to Lincoln \n\u00a0 11\nCathedral, which clearly boosts visitor numbers to the site (Wikipedia 2010). The web site \nredesign although undoubtedly attractive, was developed however as a one off initiative and \nnot in the context of an overall strategy. \nTHE SCHOOLS MARKET AND MAGNA CARTA \nAs Misiura (2006) has pointed out, a large number of heritage organisations in the United \nKingdom claim the schools market and education as a major role for their sites. This is no \nless true of the Lincoln Magna Carta. Despite this, little consultation has occurred between \nthose at the Cathedral responsible for marketing the Magna Carta and school groups, like \nstudents and teachers.  With no marketing plan and no general pricing strategy framework to \nwork within, prices have been arbitrarily fixed at \u00a31.00 entrance for each child. This is for an \norganised schools visit of the Cathedral, with a tour guide, where a vellum copy of the Magna \nCarta is always kept for viewing. The count for 2009 from the education department shows \nthat over six and a half thousand school children plus teachers had visited the Cathedral in \nthat year. Again, as with the general tourist market, important revenue generating \nopportunities are being lost, because no Magna Carta goods are on sale in either the Cathedral \nor Castle shops. A range of relatively inexpensive goods could be targeted at children, for \nexample traditional jigsaws of the Magna Carta, badges and broaches, notebooks and \npossibly replica figures from history. Market research could assist in the development of a \nMagna Carta product strategy here, through the engagement of children, parents and school \nauthorities in a major research exercise. Similarly, a more inventive entrance pricing policy \ncould be researched to find out what the market might bear and to consider differentiated \npricing, according to type of visit and age groups. On a related point, it is possible for schools \nto book a tour of the Castle at the same time as the Cathedral visit, to include a viewing of the \nMagna Carta. If requested, talks can be put on about the document as well. Here, the potential \nexists for a special area to be set aside, that could include the use of the latest interactive \n\u00a0 12\ntechnology to stimulate school students. This technology could be used in conjunction with \nthe talk as part of planned workshops. \nTo support schools, there has been a teaching manual created in collaboration with the \nNational Union of Teachers and the National Education Association of America. \nUnfortunately, as far as the author\u2019s knowledge is concerned, this expensive and highly \nprofessional teaching aid, with its potential to raise the brand profile of the Magna Carta, has \nnot been used in the UK. This workbook contains information and activities about the Magna \nCarta, with an emphasis on its relevance for life today (National Educational Association et \nal, 2008). Furthermore for schools, a marketing resource made available has been the creation \nof a package of branded materials. Without the benefit however of a central marketing \nstrategy, its use has been very limited. On offer are a pop-up Magna Carta display screen, two \npromotional leaflets already described in the section above, plus an accompanying DVD and \nthe Cathedral Magna Carta book. In addition, on the Lincoln Cathedral homepage a special \nweb site has been set up for schools\u00a0 (Schools web site 2009). The site enables teachers to \nbook tours online and it also has a teacher\u2019s resource area, a timeline, information on \nworkshops for school students and a virtual tour of the Cathedral.\u00a0Some good feedback was \nreceived on the site at its launch, but it has not been extensively promoted.  \nIn 2008, another initiative was introduced, clearly aimed at the education market. In \ncollaboration with the University of Lincoln and Lincolnshire County Council, the \nCathedral\u2019s education department launched the inaugural Magna Carta Forum. The latter \nreceived sponsorship from local business and its primary focus was Lincoln sixth formers and \ntwelfth graders from the United States. Magna Carta 2008; Exploring Democracy (see Events \nand Conferences 2008) brought to the University  leading speakers from  law, politics, \nbusiness, the media  and education,  including Lord Falconer, Tony Benn and Liam Fox. A \nseries of workshops, lectures and discussions took place on current thinking about \n\u00a0 13\ndemocracy, resulting in some positive publicity for the Magna Carta. This activity has only \ntaken place the once, despite its evident success where local businesses acted as sponsors. In \nterms of revenue, key merchandising opportunities were missed; for example books and \nvarious types of e resources could have been sold to the large number of students and \nteachers in attendance. The fact that no plans exist to repeat the forum or to seriously address \nthe issue of  its evaluation, shows  the ad hoc nature of the Magna Carta marketing activity.  \nAdditionally, appealing not only to the schools market but to the general visitor is the annual \nMagna Carta Week. This is held in collaboration with Lincolnshire County Council to raise \nthe profile of the document. Recent activities have seen a public lecture about Nicola de la \nHaye, who was appointed Sheriff of Lincoln by King John in 1216. As part of the week, there \nhas in the past been a special exhibition in Lincoln Cathedral\u2019s Wren Library of medieval \ndocuments and a talk and tour of the Heraldry of St Ann\u2019s Chapel in the Cathedral. In the \nwider County, Magna Carta lectures have been delivered in venues which have strong \nhistorical associations with the document, such as Gainsborough Old Hall. This building \noriginally offered a place to worship for the Mayflower Pilgrims who eventually set sail for \nNew England in 1620. Magna Carta week has also seen a medieval hog roast event, reflecting \nthe increased attention being paid to the relationship between food and drink and heritage \n(Misiura 2006). Outside of Magna Carta week, a Cathedral Magna Carta promotional stand \nhas been in evidence at the annual Lincolnshire Agricultural Show (Wilson 2008), although it \nis unclear at whom this is targeted. \nMAGNA CARTA IN AMERICA \nWhen the first English settlers sailed for the New World at the beginning of the 17th century, \nthey took a strong belief in the power of Magna Carta with them (Bennett et al 2007). As a \nresult, the American market represents a key source of interest for the Magna Carta \n\u00a0 14\n(Linebaugh 2008). In addition, the American Constitution itself was based on principles \ndeemed to come from Magna Carta, that the rights and liberties of the people should be \nprotected by law against the encroachment of power delegated to their governments (Bennett \net al 2007). A substantial sum of money is generated for the Cathedral through renting out the \nMagna Carta in America, an amount not significantly diminished by the costs of insurance \nand transport and in the case of the latest tour, armed guards to accompany its movement \nfrom Heathrow airport.  Working for the Cathedral in America is a public relations company \nthat has been asked to find institutions to take and display the Magna Carta. This finding of \ninstitutions is dependent on the contacts that the public relations company has and in \nparticular, one person\u2019s connections and the places they think the Magna Carta should appear \nin.  The result is that any positioning based on marketing the Magna Carta as a medieval \nhistorical artefact gets lost, being replaced by a concern with demonstrating the documents \nrelevance to American society and politics.  \nIn 2007, the first of the recent tours to America took place, where previously it had not been \nsince 1987 (www.lincolncathedral).  The following examples all indicate how each institution \nadopted the display of the Magna Carta to reflect their own individual whims, rather than that \nof a planned strategy directed by the Cathedral. The Lincoln Magna Carta initially appeared \nbriefly at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia (NEA 2007), where over 10,000 \npeople saw it in the space of a few days in July. It next moved to the Contemporary Art \nCentre of Virginia, as part of the four hundredth anniversary celebration of the founding of \nthe first permanent English settlement in Jamestown (Magna Carta on Display in Virginia \n2007). To promote the exhibition, entitled \u2018Magna Carta and Four Foundations of Freedom\u2019, \nfour days of special events were organised including a special opening, with refreshments and \nthe use of actors dressed as historical figures that mingled with visitors to promote \ndiscussion. A special preview dinner, with music and historical enactments, was also \n\u00a0 15\navailable via ticket purchase, in addition to the normal exhibition entrance price. Besides \nbeing able to view the exhibition, visitors could take part in family activities and a range of \neducational programmes. Artists were asked to mount an additional exhibition, indicating \nhow Magna Carta\u2019s theme of individual freedom could be visually expressed.  \nThe next American tour took place from January to June 2009, where the Magna Carta was \non display at the Ronald Regan Presidential Library in California.  In the first seven weeks, \nthe exhibition entitled \u2018Magna Carta; the Essence of Democracy\u2019, saw fifty six thousand \nvisitors view the document (Lincolnshire Echo 2009). To coincide with the exhibition in late \nJanuary a lecture was given by the Dean of Lincoln Cathedral entitled \u201cTo Have But Not to \nHold \u2013 Possessing the Magna Carta\u201d (2009). This lecture was posted on YouTube, thus \nputting part of the Magna Carta marketing strategy into the realms of social media. In \nSeptember 2009, Magna Carta was again on the move in America, this time to the Fraunces \nTavern Museum in New York, where it appeared until December 2009 (Fraunces Tavern \nMuseum to Display 1215 Magna Carta 2009). Here, the exhibition was called \u2018Magna Carta \nand the Foundations of Freedom\u2019. Explaining the purpose behind the exhibit, Museum \npresident, Charles Lucas said that, \u201cFraunces Tavern Museum wanted to bring Magna Carta \nto New York because this document is at the root of the American Revolution-which is what \nour Museum is about.\u2019\u2019 (Human Rights Exhibit at Fraunces Tavern Museum to Feature 1215 \nMagna Carta 2009). In support of these sentiments, a rare copy of the Declaration of \nIndependence was included in the exhibition and also depicted were scenes from the \nrevolutionary war against the British, the latter some say partly inspired by the Magna Carta \n(Linebaugh 2008). The exhibition web provided an opportunity for consumers to download \nan exhibition brochure and prospective visitors were boldly told to see \u2018at least once in your \nlifetime the Magna Carta, the document that changed the world\u2019.  In this particular case, the \n\u00a0 16\nMagna Carta is being inextricably linked by marketing efforts to American struggles for \nindependence and not much else. \nIn terms of its tour of the American market, it can be argued that the Cathedral has clearly \nlost control of the brand. Local marketing efforts in America tie the Magna Carta primarily to \nthe development of American politics, rather than to its historical appeal and inspirer of legal \nfreedom around the globe. As indicated above, each institution is able to display the \ndocument as it chooses and to develop its own messages and materials around the document. \nThe public relations company used in America to find takers for the Magna Carta display are \nhighly selective, favouring organisations that reinforce the links between the Magna Carta \nand American political values that relate to independence and individual freedom. \nInterestingly, organisations like the William J Clinton Presidential Library and Museum were \nnot offered the document, possibly because they might emphasis a perspective on the Magna \nCarta that perceives it as being concerned principally with promoting a form of justice that \ndepends on the right of democratic control over common resources and movements to resist \nworld poverty.  (Linebaugh 2008).  What the Cathedral could attempt to do to the Magna \nCarta brand is to standardise it more in terms of symbolism and the tangible benefits that \naccompany its display. For example, the Cathedral could put together a major brand package \nof resources containing a comprehensive range of integrated promotional materials with a \nclear message, accompanied by the type of complementary goods mentioned earlier. This \npackage could be developed for use when the Magna Carta tours, in order to reflect a clear \nmarket position and to potentially increase its exposure to a wider range of organisations and \nconsumers. \n \n\u00a0 17\nCONCLUSION: MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF MARKETING A DOCUMENT \nTHAT CHANGED THE WORLD \nIn a recent YouGov poll commissioned by the British Library, Lewis (2008) indicates that if \nresults of the research were extrapolated to the population as a whole, then 45% of people \nwould not know what the Magna Carta is. Some respondents thought the term Magna Carta \nreferred to a bottled Irish cider, obviously confusing it with a similar sounding brand.  If the \nMagna Carta is indeed a document that has changed the world and there is a convincing \nargument to say it has (Whipps 2008; West 2008), then it is clear that much more could be \ndone to market it effectively. Firstly, more needs to be done to increase the general awareness \nof what the Magna Carta is. In conjunction with the other three owners in the UK of the \nMagna Carta, it might be possible to embark on joint discussions and marketing programmes \nassociated with the document. In terms of the Lincoln Magna Carta, whilst some satisfactory \nelements of marketing have been acknowledged, this case study has identified a number of \nproblems. It is evident that there exists some potential for confusion regarding the positioning \nof the Magna Carta brand in the perception of its three markets. In undertaking positioning, \nthe strategist is indicating to customers what the product means and how it differs from \ncompetitors in the market (Keller et. al. 2008). Currently, three approaches to positioning \nappear to have been adopted by the Cathedral, but there have been no studies undertaken with \nconsumers to judge the success of this. Firstly, the Magna Carta is positioned as a medieval \nartefact, secondly as an iconic document of relevance to modern society and thirdly, in the \ncase of America, as a symbol of political values. It is not at all clear that all consumers relate \nto all these positioning approaches and the nature of the Cathedral\u2019s idiosyncratic marketing \nactivity. The consequences of this neglect are that there may be unknown and unfavourable \nimages of the brand existing in customer minds, having an adverse impact on visitor \nnumbers, perceptions and revenue generation. As has been noted to date, relatively little \n\u00a0 18\nmarket research has been completed, apart from a survey directed at the launch of the schools \nweb site and a very small scale project on visitor perceptions of the Cathedral generally. Hard \ninformation is very sketchy on all these areas. Furthermore, one major area that has been \nignored in terms of research and strategy is the impact of actual and potential competition. \nWith Lincoln being a key UK attraction in terms of the heritage market, this latter task should \nbe tackled as a matter of urgency. \nIn terms of market segmentation research, more data collection and analysis needs to be \nundertaken. For example, the schools market covers a wide range of age groups that \npotentially means marketing resources could be directed in more diverse ways. Younger \nchildren on a visit to the Castle exhibition   might be engaged by the opportunity to meet and \ntalk to a \u2018historical figure\u2019 associated with the Magna Carta, while older age groups could \ntake part in role plays that replicate the signing of the document. Ideas could be put out to \nschools and it should be possible to engage in the co-creation\u00a0 (Prahalad and  Ramaswamy \n2000) of ideas via forums that are both on and off line. Equally, it is possible that a better \nprofile of general tourists could be developed, with perhaps some special events put on for \noverseas visitors to the Magna Carta exhibition. A research project could also be initiated in \nthe American market, to find out the requirements of consumers, with a view to establishing \nconsistency in the messages and the medium.  So, it seems reasonably clear that research \nactivity needs to inform the marketing of the Magna Carta in a more developed and \nsystematic fashion than is currently the case. A recent initiative is of relevance to this issue. \nIn early 2009, the Heritage Lottery fund announced that a bid from Lincoln Castle, with \nsupport from the Cathedral, for 6.2 million pounds in funding had passed the initial \napplication phase. If the final bid is accepted, then the Castle environs would be revamped to \ninclude a new purpose built exhibition centre to house the Magna Carta (see BBC News \n2009). With the Magna Carta celebrating its 800th anniversary in 2015, the marketing benefits \n\u00a0 19\nof a permanent exhibition could be very significant indeed. Currently then, a major \nopportunity is being missed in terms of collecting visitor ideas on what the new exhibition \ncentre should contain. The setting up of a dialogue with target groups of school visitors and \ngeneral tourists to the Magna Carta could help to ensure that the new exhibition centre \ncontains the types of features that customers require, be it merchandise for sale, special \ninteractive features or the general type of ambiance and atmosphere that needs to be created. \nIn the shorter term, market research could be actioned in order provide a range of ideas for \nimprovements to the current exhibition, highlighted in an earlier section above. \nThere are important implications here in this case study not only for those marketing heritage \nand the Magna Carta, but for any company that needs to think about strategic revitalization. \nIn considering issues needing attention and of relevance to the Magna Carta, like brand \nidentity, positioning, market segmentation, and market research, it is clear that an important \nand necessary organising feature is the overall approach to strategy that is adopted. In the \ncase of Lincoln Cathedral, no such strategy exists. This is not to suggest that employees go \nout and immediately adopt an off the shelf marketing plan with a view to implementing it, but \nthey do think about how the present can be best managed and the future created. Strategy \nshould provide a sense of direction, by understanding the environment and pursuing a desired \nend state, with an appropriate eye kept on resources and a concomitant monitoring of \nactivities. To help provide a sense of renewal in terms of marketing the Magna Carta, it is \nsuggested that the Cathedral could think about adopting the Schindehutte et. al. (2009) \nframework for identifying a new business model. This has six questions which bring together \nmany of the problems identified in this paper. The questions posed should be answered by \norganisations in terms of rejuvenating or reinventing their marketing strategy, in relation to a \nproduct or service. Firstly, how is consumer value created and for whom? The Cathedral \nwould need to think clearly about the markets it serves and what is being offered in terms of \n\u00a0 20\nthe total product and the augmented product value that is the Magna Carta. This includes \ncomplementary goods and visitor experiences. Next, sources of competence inside the \nCathedral have to be identified that are able to help with the new venture. Some of these \nmight be networking and resource leveraging, to bring in funds for expansion of the offering. \nFourthly, the question of competitive positioning should be tackled. The Cathedral urgently \nneeds to ask if the Magna Carta can be positioned more selectively against the significant \nrange of competitors in the market, or if some form of repositioning need occur. Component \nfive of the model asks how money is made and the Cathedral needs to directly address the \nissue of revenue generation so as to develop a sound economic model revolving around \ndiscussions of volumes and margins, something badly neglected to date. Finally, the question \nof ambition has to be addressed. Potentially, there exists the opportunity to take the Magna \nCarta on tour to other countries besides America and to invest in the document generally, so \nthat overall market coverage and revenue streams increase. \nFinally, having a notion of the right objectives is a key issue here. Objectives provide focus \nand justification for action and hence should be embodied in strategy (Wilson and Gilligan \n2005). A well thought through strategy would force the Cathedral\u2019s marketing authorities to \nthink about the Magna Carta in a holistic fashion. A constant monitoring of the environment \nand market segments should occur, yielding sets of objectives relating to the Magna Carta \nbrand identity, its positioning, its resource set and its value proposition. This need not occur \nin any linear fashion, but can be an organic process, where one action flows into another \n(Ardley 2009). Creativity and intuitive insight should not be ignored either, as it is an \nimportant part of strategy (Bilton and Cummings 2010). It might be the case that to act first \non the basis of an innovative idea from an employee or customer will produce good results. A \n\u2018trial and error\u2019 approach might reveal for example, if a new complementary Magna Carta \nproduct is well received or not, in the Lincoln Castle shop or if an inventive logo for Magna \n\u00a0 21\nCarta works. But, to take a step back, to get to the stage of actually having an overall strategy \nmight mean that an internal critical self- analysis on the part of those marketing the Lincoln \nMagna Carta is required. The question should be asked if there exists, in the first instance, the \nwill to deliver something commercially viable. If the answer is no, or a hesitant, ambivalent \nyes, then work must begin to take place around establishing a strong strategic orientation. Or \notherwise, without that, and its results, the marketing of the Lincoln Magna Carta in its \npresent fashion is likely to continue to be both very challenging and very difficult indeed, \nfrom both a customer and a competitor perspective. \n  \nREFERENCES \nArdley, B.
