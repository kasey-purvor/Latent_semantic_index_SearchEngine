For all the native and non-\nnative teachers, speech rate, the mean length of utterance, phonation time ratio and the number of \nstressed words produced per minute were the best predictors of fluency scores.

The number of filled and unfilled pauses and other disfluency phenomena were not \nfound to influence perceptions of fluency. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n When one inquires about someone\u2019s level of proficiency, the answer is often that \"I can speak \nthe language fluently.\" Speaking a language fluently is frequently the ultimate goal to be attained in \nmastering a language. Despite the fact that the terms \"fluency\" and \"fluently\" are regularly used in \nlanguage pedagogy and language testing as well as in various fields of applied linguistics, there seems \nto be no consensus concerning what is understood by these concepts (Chambers, 1997). Moreover, it \nis not only the definition of fluency that has been a matter of debate, but its measurement as well (see \ne.g. Koponen and Riggenbach, 2000). Research investigating what variables underlie listeners\u2019 \nperception of fluency has also been very scarce. The study of how fluency can be measured in a \nreliable way is important in several fields. In language testing the candidates' fluency is frequently \njudged, and by knowing which temporal measures of fluency contribute best to the listeners' \nperception of fluency and distinguish fluent and non-fluent speakers, more reliable criteria can be \ndeveloped. This knowledge is also useful in language pedagogy since it can help learners in enhancing \ntheir fluency. Establishing reliable measures of fluency is also important for researchers in applied \nlinguistics since fluency of students' oral production is often assessed in a number of studies (e.g. task-\nbased language learning research Skehan, 1996; Skehan and Foster, 1997; 1999). \nAlthough there is a large body of pausological research (for a review see Griffiths, 1991), \nstudies on perceptions of fluency are not so numerous. Inspired by Riggenbach's (1991) ground-\nbreaking work, a few follow-up studies have been conducted to investigate which variables contribute \nto perceptions of fluency. Most of these studies, however, suffer from several methodological \nshortcomings partly because they use very few subjects and fail to employ reliable methods of \nanalysing the duration of pauses (e.g. Ejzenberg, 2000; Freed, 1995; 2000; Lennon, 1990; \nRiggenbach, 1991). One of the large scale studies that investigated perceptions of fluency and \nproduced reliable results was conducted by van Gelderen (1994), which, however, investigated L1 \nspeakers of Dutch. Therefore it is not clear to what extent his results are applicable for L2 learners. In \nanother important research project Fulcher (1996) analysed what kind of hesitation phenomena are \nable to predict fluency scores awarded in language proficiency exams. His study, however, failed to \nconsider certain temporal variables such as speech rate and pauses shorter than 3 seconds, both of \nwhich might be important in the perceptions of fluency.  \nAlthough there are two types of definitions of fluency: one which considers fluency as a \ntemporal phenomenon, and one that regards it as spoken language competence (for more details on \ndefinitions see the section below), fluency research suffers from the lack of studies that investigate a \ncombination of linguistic, temporal, phonological and interactional variables. Thus we have limited \nknowledge what role other variables such as accuracy, lexical diversity, grammatical complexity and \nintonation play in perceptions of fluency. Moreover, information is completely lacking on whether \nnative and non-native speakers show any differences in how they conceive of fluency.  \nThe aim of our research is to investigate what linguistic and temporal variables predict native \nand non-native speaking teachers' perception of fluency. In this study teachers were selected as judges \nbecause it is most frequently the members of this profession who have to assess this aspect of speech \nproduction. In addition, they are the ones who make explicit judgements in various types testing \nsituations and in deciding how to improve students' fluency. Analysing temporal features of spoken \ntexts is very time-consuming and difficult, therefore we could only investigate the speech samples of \n16 learners of English as a foreign language, but this number is higher than in most earlier research \nand allows for the use of non-parametric statistics. We collected samples from two proficiency groups \nand analysed them with the help of a computer program, which is able to identify speech segments \nand silent pauses to a high degree of precision. The two groups were then compared along a wide \nrange of temporal variables. We also correlated measures of accuracy, lexical richness and \nproductivity with fluency scores awarded by three experienced native and non-native speaking \nteachers and testers in order to establish which of these variables are more influential in perceptions of \nfluency.  \n \nREVIEW OF LITERATURE \n \nDefinitions of fluency \n \n In one of the first studies investigating fluency, Fillmore (1979) conceptualised fluency in four \ndifferent ways. First, he defined fluency as the ability to talk at length with few pauses and to be able \nto fill the time with talk. Second, a fluent speaker is not only capable of talking without hesitations but \nof expressing his\/her message in a coherent, reasoned and \"semantically densed\" manner. Third, a \nperson is considered to be fluent if he\/she knows what to say in a wide of range of contexts. Finally, \nFillmore (1979) argued that fluent speakers are creative and imaginative in their language use and a \nmaximally fluent speaker has all of the above mentioned abilities. Fillmore\u2019s definition of fluency is \nvery extensive, but it is unclear how this conceptualization differs from the definition of global oral \nproficiency.  \n One of the first definitions of second language fluency was provided by Pawley and Syder \n(1983), who regard native-like fluency as \"the native speaker\u2019s ability to produce fluent stretches of \ndiscourse\" (p. 191). This definition is of much narrower scope than that of Fillmore and has served as \na basis for several further studies. \n Lennon (1990, 2000) pointed out that fluency is usually used in two senses. In the so-called \nbroad sense, fluency seems to mean global oral proficiency, that is, a fluent speaker has a high \ncommand of the foreign or second language.  The definition proposed by Sajavaara (1987) can also be \nregarded as a broad conceptualisation of fluency. He defined fluency as \u201cthe communicative \nacceptability of the speech act, or \u2018communicative fit\u2019\u201d (p. 62). He also points out that expectations \nconcerning what is appropriate in a communicative context vary according to the situation, therefore \nhis definition seems to be very difficult to operationalise. This conceptualisation of fluency bears \nresemblance to the third aspect of fluency described by Fillmore (1979). \n  In its narrower sense, fluency can be considered one component of oral proficiency, which is \noften used as one of the scores in assessing candidates' oral language skills in an exam situation. \nLennon (1990) pointed out that fluency differs from the other scores in oral language exams (e.g. \naccuracy, appropriacy, etc.) in that it is purely a performance phenomenon, and consequently defined \nfluency as \u201can impression on the listener\u2019s part that the psycholinguistic processes of speech planning \nand speech production are functioning easily and efficiently\u201d (p. 391). Thus he argued that \u201cfluency \nreflects the speaker\u2019s ability to focus the listener\u2019s attention on his\/her message by presenting a \nfinished product, rather than inviting the listener to focus on the working of the production \nmechanisms\u201d (pp. 391-392). Rehbein (1987) provided a similar definition, claiming that \u201cfluency \nmeans that the activities of planning and uttering can be executed nearly simultaneously by the \nspeaker of the language\u201d (p. 104).  He also added that fluency depends on the context, namely on the \n\u201cspeaker\u2019s evaluation of the hearer\u2019s expectations\u201d (p.104). Schmidt (1992) refined Lennon\u2019s (1990) \ndefinition by adding that fluency in speech production is \u201cautomatic procedural skill\u201d (based on \nCarlson, Sullivan, & Schneider, 1989) and that fluent speech \u201cis automatic, not requiring much \nattention or effort\u201d (Schmidt, 1992, p. 358). In a more recent study, Lennon (2000) synthesised earlier \ndefinitions and proposed that \"a working definition of fluency might be the rapid, smooth, accurate, \nlucid, and efficient translation of thought or communicative intention into language under the \ntemporal constraints of on-line processing (p. 26).\"  \n \nMeasures of fluency \n \n Just as defining fluency is rather problematical, the establishment of the components of fluency \nis not without difficulty, either. Four different approaches to delineating the measures of fluency exist \nin the investigation of L2 learner\u2019s speech. The first trend of research is concerned with the temporal \naspects of speech production (e.g. Lennon 1990; M\u00f6hle, 1984), the second combines these variables \nwith the investigation of interactive features (e.g. Riggenbach, 1991) and the third approach explores \nthe phonological aspects of fluency (e.g. Hieke, 1984, Wennerstrom, 2000) as well. Finally, recent \nstudies have included the analysis of formulaic speech in studying fluency in second language speech \n(e.g Ejzenberg, 2000;  Towell et al., 1996). \n A number of studies have been concerned with establishing the appropriate measures of \nfluency. The empirical studies in this field used three different approaches: they either investigated the \ndevelopment of fluency longitudinally (Freed, 1995; 2000; Lennon, 1990; Towell et al.,1996), or \ncompared fluent and non-fluent speakers (Ejzenberg, 2000; Riggenbach, 1991; Tonkyn, 2001) or \ncorrelated fluency scores with temporal variables (Rekart and Dunkel, 1992, Fulcher, 1996). We have \nto note again that the number of participants investigated was very small in most of these research \nprojects, and in many of them no statistical analyses and computer technology for identifying pauses \nreliably were used. Nevertheless most of them conclude that the best predictors of fluency are speech \nrate, that is, the number of syllables articulated per minute and the mean length of runs, that is, the \naverage number of syllables produced in utterances between pauses of 0.25 seconds and above (e.g. \nEjzenberg, 2000; Freed, 1995, 2000; Lennon, 1990; Riggenbach, 1991, Towell et al, 1996). \nPhonation-time  ratio, that is, the percentage of time spent speaking as a percentage proportion of the \ntime taken to produce the speech sample, was also found to be a good predictor of  fluency (Towell et \nal, 1996; Lennon, 1990; van Gelderen, 1994). Research findings are equivocal concerning the \nfrequency of filled and unfilled pauses as well as disfluencies such as repetitions, restarts and repairs. \nThe studies with small number of participants found that the frequency of silent and filled pauses \ndistinguished between fluent and non-fluent speakers (e.g. Freed, 1995, 2000; Lennon, 1990; \nRiggenbach, 1991). On the other hand, in research projects in which a higher number of students \nparticipated, the number of filled and unfilled pauses and ratings of fluency did not correlate (Rekart \nand Dunkel, 1992; van Gelderen, 1994). Most researchers agree that disfluencies tend to occur in \nclusters in the speech of non-fluent L2 learners (e.g. Freed, 1995, 2000; Riggenbach 1991), while \nfluent students tend to pause at grammatical junctures (Lennon, 1990; Towell et al., 1996). Fulcher \n(1996) looked at how the reasons why students hesitate change with the development of L2 \ncompetence. He found that low-proficiency students tend to hesitate because they have problems \nretrieving lexical items, encoding the grammatical form of their message and correcting their own \noutput. On the other hand, high-proficiency students are able to plan in advance and mostly hesitate \nonly when they want to express complex ideas. \nBased on the assumption that fluency is context-dependent (e.g. Rehbein, 1987; Sajavaara, \n1987; Lennon, 1990), Riggenbach (1991) complemented the analysis of temporal variables underlying \nsecond language fluency with the investigation of interactive features. Her results revealed that topic-\ninitiations, backchannels, substantive comments, latching and overlapping as well as the amount of \nspeech produced also contributed to fluency judgements, though to a limited extent.  \n In the field of phonological research, Hieke (1985) established additional measures of fluency \non the basis of the assumption that fluent speech equals connected speech, in which certain \nphonological procedures, such as consonant attraction are at work. Consonant attraction \u201coccurs \nwhere final consonants are drawn to the following syllable if that begins with a vowel\u201d (Hieke, 1985,  \np. 140).  In an earlier study, Hieke (1984) found that consonant attraction can be a reliable indicator of \nthe fluency of non-native speech in informal English style. Wennerstorm (2000) in her research \ninvestigated in what ways intonation influences the perception of fluency by means of analysing \ndialogues between speakers of English as a second language and native English speakers. Her study \nsuggests that it is the ability to speak in phrases instead of speaking word by word that can lead to the \nperception of fluent speech, rather than longer utterances or shorter pauses. In another study, \nVanderplank (1993) suggests that pacing (the number of stressed words per minute) and spacing (the \nproportion of stressed words to the total number of words) are better indicators of difficulty in \nlistening materials than standard speech rate measures such as syllable per minute. Indirectly, this \nwould mean that these variables are also useful in predicting fluency scores. \n Towell et al (1996) investigated what qualitative changes take place in the use of formulaic \nlanguage parallel to the increase of fluency after participants spent a year in the target language \nenvironment. They found that the two selected students improved in how they employed different \ntypes of formulae after their stay abroad. Ejzenberg (2000) compared how fluent and non-fluent \nspeakers employ formulaic language. Her results also showed that fluent students were able to make \nuse of prefabricated chunks more efficiently, whereas non-fluent learners frequently used formulae \ninappropriately.  \n \nMETHOD \nParticipants \n \n In order to investigate the differences between fluent and non-fluent speakers, two distinct groups \nof learners were selected. The eight participants of the advanced group were drawn from Hungarian \nstudents enrolled in the School of English and American Studies, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, in \ntheir third, fourth or fifth years of studies. Participants in this group were all females, whose age ranged \nfrom 19 to 30. As regards the participants\u2019 language learning history, they all had learnt English in a \nformal setting both at secondary school and\/or at language schools for a minimum of five years, and they \nalso spent a period of 6 \u2013 12 months in an English speaking country. All of the participants in this group \nhad high scores at the language proficiency exam administered at the university. \n Participants of the low-intermediate proficiency group were selected from Hungarian students \nattending a language school where they all learnt English in the same group. The students were enrolled \nin their groups based on their scores in a placement test, with the help of which it could be ensured that \ntheir level of proficiency was similar. Like the participants in the advanced group, their age ranged \nbetween 19 and 30. Six of them were females and two of them were males. They had a similar language \nlearning history in the sense that they all had learnt English at secondary school, and none of them had \nbeen to an English speaking country.  \nIn this research the three non-native speaking judges of the participants' fluency were Hungarian \nnative speakers who were experienced university teachers of applied linguistics and examiners in the \nlanguage proficiency exams administered at the school. The three teachers were all females with at least \n10 years of experience in the profession. In selecting the native speaking participants we wanted one \nstandard British, one standard American speaker and a speaker with a non-standard British accent to be \nrepresented. Thus a male speaker of standard British English, and a male teacher, who was a speaker of \nEnglish with a slight Scottish accent were selected. Both of these teachers had at least 10 years \nexperience in teaching and also acted as examiners at the university. The third native speaker participant \nwas a young female American visiting teacher, with a few years experience in teaching but with limited \nexperience as a language tester.  \nAll the participants, both the teachers and the students were informed of the purpose of the \nresearch, and they participated in it on a voluntary basis. Participants\u2019 anonymity was preserved in every \nphase of the study.  \n \nProcedures \n \nMaterials collected for this research involved tape-recorded speech samples that were 2-3 minutes \nlong on average. Participants carried out a narrative task which was similar to traditionally used \nelicitation devices in pausological research (e.g. Riazantseva, 2001). The students were asked to choose \nfrom three sets of cartoon strips and were instructed to make up a story related to the selected cartoon. \nThe cartoons used in the description task consisted of a series of 6-10 pictures arranged in a logical order. \nCartoons were taken from popular English course books and were designed for similar tasks. Selection \ncriteria for the cartoons included relative simplicity of the story and of the vocabulary necessary to \ndescribe it (Riazantseva, 20001). The choice of narrative was motivated by two reasons. First, computer-\nanalysis of speech phenomena becomes very difficult in an interactive task, where it might happen that \nthe two speakers talk simultaneously. Second, it is known from very early research on pausology \n(Goldman-Eisler, 1968) and also from task-based research (for a review see Skehan, 1998) that having to \nproduce different types of content places different cognitive load on speakers, which, in turn, influences \nthe fluency of the production. By providing fixed content (a series of pictures that form a story), the \ninfluencing factor of content could be eliminated. Time devoted to planning was specified in two \nminutes. These two minutes were provided for the participants to have enough time to understand the \nstory depicted in the cartoon and to gather their thoughts about how they will narrate it. One of the \nresearchers was always present at the recording but did not intervene in case of hesitations or problems. \nThe students' performance was recorded on an audio-tape.  \nThe three native and non-native speaking assessors judged the oral performances of the \nparticipants on a semantic differential scale that ranged from one to five, where one corresponded to the \nleast fluent and five to the most fluent speech. The judges did not know the participants of the research \nand the speech samples were mixed on the tape. Descriptors for the five categories were not given in \norder to gain intuitive judgements, but they were asked to comment on their scores for each participant. \n \nAnalysis \n \nIn order to gain precise temporal measures, the speech samples were transcribed with the help of a \ncomputer program called Transcriber. By means of this program each silent pause was detected and \nmeasured in milliseconds. Every speech run distinguishable from the amplitude of the background noise \nwas transcribed by the researcher, and with the help of the program the duration of speech runs was also \nmeasured. In this study we examined the following ten temporal variables: \n1. Speech rate \nRate of speech was calculated according to the method recommended by Riggenbach (1991). The \ntotal number of syllables produced in a given speech sample was divided by the amount of total \ntime required to produce the speech sample, (including pause time) expressed in seconds. This \nfigure was then multiplied by sixty to give a figure expressed in syllables per minute. Following \nRiggenbach\u2019s suggestions (1991), unfilled pauses under 3 seconds were not included in the \ncalculation of speech rate. Unfilled pauses shorter than 3 seconds are generally regarded \narticulation pauses and not as hesitation phenomena. \n2. Articulation rate \nIn calculating the articulation rate the total number of syllables produced in a given speech sample \nwas divided by the amount of time taken to produce them in seconds, which was then multiplied \nby sixty. Unlike in the calculation of speech rate, pause time was excluded. Articulation rate is \nexpressed as the mean number of syllables produced per minute over the total amount of time \nspent speaking when producing the speech sample. Following Riggenbach (1991), in the \narticulation rate all semantic units were counted, \u201cincluding filled pauses and partial words (using \nthe criterion that partial words contain not just an initial consonant but also a vowel and thus are \nrecognizable as words)\u201d (p.428). \n3. Phonation-time ratio \nPhonation-time ratio was calculated as the percentage of time spent speaking as a percentage \nproportion of the time taken to produce the speech sample\u201d (Towell et al., 1996, p. 91). \n4. Mean length of runs  \nThe mean length of runs was calculated as an average number of syllables produced in utterances \nbetween pauses of 0.25 seconds and above. Towell et al. (1996) point out that there has been an \nongoing debate among researchers about the cut-off point of pause length. If this point is too low, \nthe stop phase indicated by the computer may signal a plosive or other phenomena that should not \nbe considered as hesitations. If the cut-off point is too high, some amount of time may be omitted \nfrom the analysis. Therefore Towell et al. argue that pauses above 0.25 seconds are the most \nreliable cut-off points. \n5. The number of  silent pauses per minute \nIn analysing pauses, pauses over 0.2 seconds were considered. Pauses shorter than 0.2 seconds are \nconsidered micro-pauses and are not regarded as hesitation phenomena (Riggenbach, 1991). Due \nto the fact that the speech samples were not of equal length, the total number of pauses was \ndivided by the total amount of time spent speaking expressed in seconds and was multiplied by \n60. \n6. The mean length of pauses \nThe mean length of pauses was calculated by dividing the total length of pauses above 0.2 \nseconds by the total number of pauses above 0.2 seconds. \n7. The number of filled pauses per minute \nThe total number of filled pauses such as uhm, er, mm were divided by the total amount of time \nexpressed in seconds and was multiplied by 60. \n8. The number of disfluencies per minute \nThe total number of disfluencies such as repetitions, restarts and repairs were divided by the total \namount of time expressed in seconds and was multiplied by 60. \n9. Pace  \nThe number of stressed words per minute (Vanderplank, 1993). \n10. Space \nThe proportion of stressed words to the total number of words (Vanderplank, 1993). \nThe quantity of talk students produced was measured by the total number of words (see also \nDewaele, 2000; Dewaele and Pavlenko, 2003; D\u00f6rnyei and Kormos, 2000). In order to assess lexical \ndiversity, we used Malvern's and Richards' (1997) D-formula. This formula is based on the widely \nused measure of lexical variety, the type-token ratio (TTR), which is the total number of different \nwords (types) divided by the total number of words (tokens) produced. The problem with the TTR is, \nhowever, that it depends on the sample size, that is, on the number of words spoken by the \nparticipants. Richards (1987) found that the \"type-token ratio falls rapidly as the number of tokens \nincreases\" (p. 205). In a recent study Jarvis (2002) argued that Malvern's and Richards' (1997) D-\nformula can be used to measure lexical richness in L2 texts in a reliable way, therefore we  \napplied this formula to establish a measure of lexical diversity. \n1\n Accuracy was measured by the \nproportion of error-free clauses relative to the total number of clauses. This measure has been widely \n                                                 \n1\n The calculation of the D-value is based on a mathematical probabilistic model, and the \nsoftware available at the CHILDES web-site: http\/\/childes.psy.cmu.edu uses random sampling of \ntokens in plotting the curve of TTR against increasing token size for the text to be investigated. \nused in task-based research and has been proven to reflect the accuracy grammatical complexity of \nstudents' output in a reliable manner (see Bygate, 1999; Foster, and Skehan, 1996; Skehan and Foster, \n1997). \nWe computed Spearman rank-order correlations between the temporal and linguistic variables and \nstudents' fluency scores and also looked at the correlations between the variables. Fluent and non-fluent \nspeakers were compared by means of the Mann-Whitney U-test. \n \nRESULTS  \n First of all, we looked at the comments of the assessors in order to establish what factors \ninfluenced their judgements. The non-native speaker teachers most frequently they justified the \nawarded scores with reference to the naturalness and ease of flow of speech, the presence or lack of \npauses and self-corrections, the speed of delivery and the efficiency with which students handle \nbreakdowns. Other important reasons behind their judgements were the accuracy of the output and the \nrange of vocabulary employed. Sometimes they mentioned that the participant was not verbose or that \nthey used linking words appropriately. The native speaker teachers also gave varied reasons for their \njudgements. All of them referred to speed of delivery, the absence or abundance of hesitation \nphenomena, but they differed as regards the importance of lexical variety and accuracy. While all the \ncomments of the American teacher mentioned the accuracy of output, and the standard British English \nspeaker also made frequent reference to grammatical and lexical errors, the Scottish teacher did not \nmention this aspect of performance. The inter-rater reliability for the three non-native speaker teachers \nwas 0.78, which considering the fact that no descriptors were given can be regarded as acceptable. \nThe inter-rater reliability for the native speakers was considerably lower (r= 0.72).  \n As can be seen in Table 1, the Mann-Whitney U-test revealed significant differences between \nfluent and non-fluent participants in the case of five of the investigated ten temporal variables: speech \n                                                                                                                                                                      \nMalvern and Richards (1997) argue that the D-value is a valid measure of diversity because it does not \ndepend on the length of the sample, and it uses all the words produced by the participants. \nrate, phonation time ratio, the mean length of runs and of pauses as well as pace (the number of stressed \nwords per minute). Advanced students spoke faster, silent pauses took up a smaller proportion of their \nspeaking time, produced longer stretches of discourse between pauses, used shorter pauses and uttered \nmore stressed words within a minute than low-intermediate students. Fluent speakers produced more \naccurate and lexically more diverse output than their less fluent counterparts.  \n--------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 around here \n--------------------------------------------- \n \n We calculated two composite fluency scores for the participants: one of them was the sum of \nscores awarded by the native speaker teachers and the other the sum of the non-native speaker scores.  \nTable 2 shows the rank-order correlations with these two types of composite scores and with each of the \nraters' scores. The results indicate that there is a set of variables that can predict both the composite and \nthe individual raters\u2019 fluency scores in a reliable way. These are the speech rate, the phonation time ratio, \nthe mean length of runs and the number of stressed words per minute (pace). Each of these temporal \nmeasures correlates strongly both with the native and the non-native teachers\u2019 scores. Among them \nspeech rate, the mean length of runs and pace are the best predictors, which can account between 60 and \n80% of the variance in the fluency scores. The mean length of pauses is also significantly related to the \ncomposite native and non-native fluency scores, but it does not correlate with all of the individual raters\u2019 \nscores. It seems that for one of the native and one of the non-native teachers it was an important factor \nthat influenced their judgements, but the rest of the assessors did not take the length of pauses into \nconsideration. The importance of linguistic measures in perceptions of fluency is also ambiguous. While \nthe native and non-native teachers\u2019 composite scores show moderate correlations with accuracy, lexical \nvariety and productivity, individual raters differ as regards these measures. One of the native and one of \n                                                                                                                                                                      \n \nthe non-native teachers did not attribute great importance to accuracy. One of the non-native teachers \n(NNS3) consistently did not take any of the linguistic measures into consideration. Table 2 also shows \nthat certain temporal variables such as articulation rate, the number of silent and filled pauses and the \nnumber of disfluencies per minute as well as the ratio of stressed and unstressed words (space) are not \nrelated to fluency scores. \nThe rank-order correlations between the temporal variables shown in Table 3 reveal that pace, \nspeech rate, phonation-time ratio, the mean length of runs and of pauses are strongly correlated with each \nother. The other cluster of temporal variables that are related include the number of filled and unfilled \npauses and disfluencies per minute. The linguistic variables all significantly correlate with pace, speech \nrate and the mean length of runs with accuracy showing the highest correlation with these temporal \nmeasures. \n \n--------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 2 around here \n--------------------------------------------- \n If we examine individual participant's scores and their performance on various temporal and \nlinguistic measures we can see that Participant 15, who together with Participant 16 received the highest \nnumber of points, produced the highest number of stressed words per minute and her output was also the \nmost accurate in the examined population. Participant 16 had the highest phonation time ratio and the \nmean length of pauses in her speech was the shortest. Participant 13 and 14, who both scored very high, \nwere the fastest speakers in terms of syllables per minute and the mean length of their runs was also the \nlongest. Their rank order according to the number of stressed words per minute is the third and fourth. If \nwe look at the participants at the other end of the fluency scale, we can also see that those students who \nwere judged to be the least fluent were the ones who produced the lowest number of stressed words per \nminute (e.g. Participant 1, 2 and 3). Participant 2, however, had  relatively higher speech rate and uttered \nlonger units between pauses, which is why one of the raters (NS3) perceived her to be more fluent.  \nParticipant 6 is an interesting case because she is the second slowest speaker in terms of speech rate, her \nphonation time ratio is also the second lowest and her pauses tend to be very long. Nevertheless she was \nstill perceived to be more fluent by two of the non-native speaker judges than Participant 2, who spoke \nalmost twice as fast because her accuracy was very good (86% of her clauses did not contain any \nmistake). \n--------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 3 around here \n--------------------------------------------- \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n The findings of this study indicate that there is a set of variables that are very good predictors of \nfluency scores both for native and non-native speaker judges: speech rate, the mean length of runs, \nphonation-time ratio and pace. The results concerning speech rate, the mean length of runs and \nphonation-time ratio are not new, since other researchers (e.g. e.g. Ejzenberg, 2000; Freed, 1995, 2000; \nLennon, 1990; Riggenbach, 1991; Towell et al, 1996, van Gelderen, 1994) have also argued for the use \nof this measure. The finding that pace, which is a temporal variable that also considers one specific \nfeature of intonation, namely stress, is an equally reliable predictor of fluency judgements, is novel \nbecause Vanderplank (1993) only investigated the role of pace in judgements of listening difficulty.  The \nresults are striking because one can rarely see such high correlation in studies in applied linguistics \nespecially if the number of subjects is relatively low. If we look at Table 3, it can be seen that with a few \nexceptions, the rank order that can be set up based on pace is almost the same as the rank order of \nfluency scores. This and the rate of correlations seems to be a very strong evidence for the importance of \nthis relatively underused variable in fluency research. Thus we can argue that how many stressed words \none can say in a minute is a slightly better predictor of fluency than how many syllables one utters a \nminute. In other words if a speaker utters a lot of unstressed words with a high speed, he or she is not \nnecessarily perceived to be very fluent. Our finding suggests that if one wants to make an informed \njudgement of someone's  fluency either in a language test or in an empirical study, the measure of pace \ncould also be used. This variable is relatively easy to calculate and seems to be an excellent predictor. As \nVanderplank (1993) argues, pace can also be useful in grading the difficulty of listening passages as the \nmore fluent a speaker is, the more difficulties an L2 learner might have in understanding his or her \nmessage.  \nThe finding that a high proportion of the variation in fluency scores can be explained with a \ncluster of temporal variables also shows that fluency is primarily a temporal and intonational \nphenomenon. As regards the frequency of filled and unfilled pauses and disfluencies, our study lends \nsupport to the work of those researchers who claim that these variables do not affect perceptions of \nfluency (Rekart and Dunkel, 1992; van Gelderen, 1994). The results of our study also show that there are \ntwo clusters of temporal variables; one which includes pace, the mean length of runs and pauses, speech \nrate and phonation-time ration and the other that is comprised of the frequency of filled and unfilled \npauses and other disfluencies. The former group of variables that is related to the speed of delivery seems \nto be an important factor in fluency judgements, while the latter is not. \nThis research has also lent support to Fillmore's (1979) mainly intuitive claim that perceptions of \nfluency are related to productivity as we found moderate correlations between the number of words \nproduced and participants' fluency scores. It seems that also in L2, talkative speakers are regarded as \nmore fluent.  \nOur study shows that fluency is not only a temporal phenomenon, as raters do not only look at \nspeed and pace when intuitively judging someone's fluency, but consider other variables strongly related \nto proficiency such as accuracy and lexical diversity. Our results support earlier theoretical \nconceptualisations of fluency according to which there exist two senses of fluency: low-order fluency \n(temporal aspects of fluency) and high-order fluency that can be equated with proficiency (e.g. Lennon, \n1990, 2000). Our research suggests that accuracy also plays an important role in fluency judgements and \nsometimes overrides the effect of temporal factors on listeners (e.g. in the case of Participant 6). The \ncorrelations between the temporal and linguistic variables also reveal that accuracy is positively related \nto temporal variables that are influential in fluency judgements. In other words, it seems that those \nstudents who were fluent in terms of speed and pace also produced accurate output. In psycholinguistic \nterms this means that one is only able to speak fluently if speech production mechanisms are largely \nautomatic and if automatic sequences are memorised, retrieved and used accurately (see Schmidt, 1992 \nfor a review). We also have to note that exceptions to this also exist such as Participant 6, whose \nproduction was very accurate but slow. Low-proficiency students generally cannot rely on a sufficient \nnumber of automatic sequences and apply conscious rule-based mechanisms, and if they strive to be \nhighly accurate, their speech becomes very slow. Thus in certain cases especially among less competent \nspeakers, speed and accuracy might be in inverse relationship with each other. We have to note, however, \nthat just as researchers are divided on the definitions of fluency, teachers also differ as regards the \nconceptualisation of this phenomenon. For some of them, it includes accuracy and lexical diversity, while \nsome other teachers disregard these aspects of performance.  \nOn theoretical grounds our study indicates that fluency as a concept needs to include speed, pace, \nsmoothness and accuracy. Thus, if the aim of language teaching is to help students to become fluent \nspeakers, both exercises that prompt students to express their communicative intent within the limited \ntime-constraints of real-life interactions and those that promote accuracy should be applied. Moreover, \ntasks that develop accuracy and fluency in the temporal sense at the same time seem to be the most \nuseful.  \nFor research and language testing purposes, however, it is often necessary to distinguish between \ntemporal fluency and accuracy. For researchers the conclusion of our study is that there is a new quick \nand easy way of establishing fluency with the help of the measure of pace, that is, the number of stressed \nwords uttered per minute. In terms of language testing, we suggest that descriptors of fluency should \ninclude the speed of delivery, pace and the length of fluent units. Definitions of bands that include \ndescriptors such as a high number of hesitations (filled and unfilled pauses) do not seem to be valid, as \nthe raw number of these variables does not seem to be related to proficiency or fluency. This might be \npartly due to the fact that in certain situations native speakers also frequently hesitate and that individual \nspeaking style might also influence hesitation behaviour. In addition, Fulcher (1993) argues that low and \nhigh-proficiency students might produce the same number of hesitations, but hesitate for different \nreasons and therefore create different impressions on listeners. \nThe results of our study also indicate that the investigated native and non-native teachers do not \ndiffer substantially in how they perceive fluency. Both native and non-native teachers base their \njudgements on the same set of temporal variables. Despite the fact that individual differences exist \nbetween raters as regards accuracy and lexical diversity, these do not seem to be determined by native or \nnon-native speaker status. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n The study reported in this paper investigated differences between fluent and non-fluent L2 \nlearners as well as the relationship of native and non-native teachers\u2019 perceptions of fluency and temporal \nand linguistic variables. In the research we analysed speech samples collected from 16 Hungarian L2 \nlearners at two distinct levels of proficiency with the help of computer technology and used non-\nparametric statistical analyses. The results indicate that fluency is best conceived of as fast, smooth and \naccurate performance. If we regard fluency as a temporal phenomenon, it can also be  characterised by \npace (the number of stressed words per minute).  The mean length of runs and speech rate were also \nfound to be good indicators, but we also recommend the use of pace for measuring temporal fluency as it \nalso includes one specific feature of intonation, namely stress, and it is easy to calculate. Phonation-time \nratio and the mean length of pauses were also related to fluency scores, but this relationship was weaker \nthan in the case of the mean length of runs and the speech rate. The number of filled and unfilled pauses \nand other disfluency phenomena were not found to influence perceptions of fluency. Our research also \nindicates that the accuracy of output plays an important role in fluency judgements and that accuracy and \nspeed of delivery are positively related. In other words, fluent performance entails the application of \nefficient and accurate processing mechanisms. \n Although the number of participants was higher than in most previous research, the limitation of \nthis study is its small sample size. In order to support the results presented here, this research should be \nrepeated with other types of tasks and with more L2 learners and raters. \nREFERENCES \nBygate, M. (1999).
