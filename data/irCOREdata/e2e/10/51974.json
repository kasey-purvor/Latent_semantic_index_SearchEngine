Introduction  \nContaminated mine drainage is a global problem that affects thousands of kilometres of rivers and \nstreams [1]. While ferruginous discharges are not the only type of mine waters, these are often the most \nstudied because the Fe (III) oxyhydroxide precipitates (\u201cochres\u201d) are obvious clues to the pollution \nproblems of the site and have the greatest aesthetic impact. Freshly precipitated ochres have the largest \nsorption capacity of any environmental material [2], and if this can be harnessed, then this toxic waste \nmaterial could have useful applications in mine water remediation. \nGreen rust (GR) is the generic term for the partially-reduced Fe (II) and Fe (III) oxyhydroxy salt. It is \ncommonly simulated in the laboratory [3], although it can be found in natural environments where it \noccurs as a corrosion product [4,5]. It has recently been described in soils [6] and within ochreous mine \ndrainage precipitates [7]. In recent years there has been increasing interest in GR because it can alter the \noxidation state, and hence mobility and toxicity, of inorganic contaminants in aqueous environment [3, \n8-10].  \nThe potential for GR as a reactive material in mine water remediation [11,12] and to decrease toxicity \n[3] has been alluded to in the literature. Provisional results from the laboratory studies, reported here, \nwere presented in [13]. There are, however, no comprehensive reports of experiments carried out to \nexamine GR as a remediation material. To evaluate this potential a series of stirred, open batch \nexperiments was undertaken using a variety of contaminated mine waters. A selection of the data is \naddressed in this paper and the full data set can be found in the supplementary data.  \n 3\nThe batch experiments used a naturally occurring Fe (II) and Fe (III) GR sample as a remediation \nproduct. The GR was from Ynysarwed, an abandoned coal mine site in south Wales, UK [7] (see Figure \n1). Here the GR occurs as a discrete layer, 4-6 cm thick, with an Fe (II) and Fe (total) ratio of around \n0.6, closely associated with aragonite (present at ~ 60% w\/w CaCO3), within a ferrihydrite\/ goethite \n(FG) precipitate [7]. The GR has a measured specific surface area of 0.81 m2 g-1 (calculated from laser \ngranulometry measurements) typical electron micrographs of the constituents of this material are \npresented in the supplementary material.  The experiments described here compare the effectivness of \nGR with ochre from a FG deposit, the more typical mineralogy of mine drainage precipitates where the \ndischarge is greater than pH 4.5 [14]. \n2. Experimental Methods \nA series of open vessel, stirred, batch experiments was conducted to establish the effectiveness of GR \nfor removing contaminants from mine waters. Naturally occurring GR, FG ochre, and mine waters were \nused in each experiment.  \n2.1 Sample Sites and Field Methods. Samples of mine water were collected in 25 L acid-washed \nhigh density polyethylene containers from four sites in the British Isles. Three are ocherous acid mine \ndrainage sites: Parys Mountain on Anglesey, north Wales; Avoca East; and Avoca West, in Ireland. One \nsite, Bwlch, located in mid-Wales, is a circum-neutral drainage site (see Figure 1).  \nFigure 1 at this point \nThe Parys Mountain site is an abandoned Cu mine. The discharge has a typical pH value of ~2 and \ncontains up to 80 mg\/L Fe, 24 mg\/L Zn and 8 mg\/L Cu. The Avoca sites are abandoned Cu-Zn-Pb \nmines. The Avoca East discharge, pH 3.5, contains 35 mg\/L Fe, 60 mg\/L Zn, 3 mg\/L Cu and 70 mg\/L \nAl. The Avoca West discharge, pH 4, contains 75 mg\/L Fe, 20 mg\/L Zn and 13 mg\/L Al. The Bwlch \nsite is an abandoned Pb-Zn mine where the discharge is ~ pH 6 and contains 20mg\/L Zn. \nThe GR and FG ochre were previously identified by the authors [7,15]. The GR was sealed in 5cm \ndiameter ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) pipes. The most important anion in this Ynysarwed \n 4\ndischarge is sulphate which would tend to favour the formation of sulphate green rust. The sample of \nFG ochre, used as a comparison with the GR, was taken from the Garth Tonmawr coal mine site in \nsouth Wales (see Figure 1).  \n2.2 Laboratory Preparation. The FG and a sub-sample of the GR were dried overnight at 60\u00baC. \nDuring this process the GR was exposed to air and rapidly oxidised [16] although it retained around 3% \nFe(II) by mass. These dried substances were then ground using an agate mortar and pestle and sieved to \n<180\u00b5m through a nylon mesh. All the remaining GR was kept sealed to minimize any oxidation. The \nseparate GR materials were termed dried green rust (DGR), for the oven-dried material, and wet green \nrust (WGR) for the stored\/sealed material.  \nThe Bwlch water, a ZnSO4 water with Fe <0.5 mg\/L, was spiked with FeSO4 .7H2O  (Fisher, UK \nCertified analytical reagent) to raise the Fe concentration to ~40 mg\/L: sufficient Fe for the forced \nprecipitaiton of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides by addition of GR or FG ochre. In this form Fe is unstable in the \ncircum-neutral and oxidised Bwlch water, so the FeSO4 was added in solution immediately before the \nexperiments commenced. \n2.3 Batch experiments. The FG, DGR and WGR were each mixed with the various mine waters in a \nseries of open batch experiments conducted at laboratory temperature (~18\u02daC). For each experiment 200 \nmL of mine water was transferred to a 600 mL Pyrex\u00ae beaker using a glass measuring cylinder. The pH \nof these waters was measured immediately. 1, 0.2 or 0.02g of DGR or dried FG were weighed out and \nadded. For the WGR the same dry weight equivalents were measured (~3.2g wet = 1 g dry) and added. \nThis gave three different dry weights of solid to mine water concentrations: 5 g\/L, 1 g\/L, and 0.1 g\/L. In \naddition a control experiment was included for each water, which had no GR or FG ochre added. The \nwaters were sampled just before the addition of GR or FG ochre. Once the solid had been added the \nsamples were mixed on a magnetic stirrer at sufficient speed to maintain a homogeneous mixture \nthroughout the experiment, and 15 mL samples removed from the beaker after 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 30, and 60 \nminutes. Each sample was extracted using a polyethylene syringe and was immediately filtered to <0.1 \n 5\n\u00b5m through a Whatman Anotop 25 disposable filter cartridge to remove the suspended solid material. \nDuring the experiment the solid:water ratio was not changed. The filtrate was acidified to <pH 2 with \n50% (v\/v) HNO3 (Fisher, Certified Analytical Reagent grade) and stored in sealed LDPE test tubes prior \nto analysis. \n2.4. Analyses. Once the samples had been collected they were analysed for a variety of potentially \nharmful elements (PHEs) (Fe, Al, Zn, Cu, Co Ni, Cd, REEs, Pb, Th, U) by ICP-MS and AAS. Iron, and \nwhere appropriate, Zn, Cu and Al were determined using either a Pye-Unicam SP 9 or a Perkin-Elmer \n5000 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) calibrated with a series of at least three synthetic, \nmulti-element standards. The ICP-MS was a Fisons PlasmaQuad PQ II+ (STE) ICP-MS, calibrated \nusing synthetic multi-element solutions. Measurements of pH and Eh were made using two Hanna HI \n9025 microcomputer meters equipped with either a VWR 662-1761 pH electrode or a Hanna HI 3230 \nORP electrode. \n2.5 Quality Control. Instrumental precision was estimated using sample duplicates. Precision is \nquoted as coefficient of variation, using an estimate of the standard deviation presented as a percentage \nof the mean [17]. Precision of AAS data was typically <1%, with the exception of samples with low \n(<10 mg\/l) concentrations and the Al analyses which had a precision of ~2.5%. ICP-MS data generally \nhad a precision of <1%. Experimental precision was estimated by repeating an entire experiment. For \nthe elements considered in this study the experimental precision was ~ 5%. \nThe accuracy of the analyses was established with an absolute method using a series of synthetic mine \nwaters. These solutions were produced from single element 1000 mg\/L standards (Aldrich). The \naccuracy of the AAS data was generally 2-3%, and the ICP-MS data was accurate to <5%.  \nLower limits of detection (LLD) were calculated as three times the standard deviation of a laboratory \nblank solution.  All the elements analysed by ICP-MS were calculated to have a LLD of <0.5 \u00b5g\/L. The \nAAS LLDs were obtained from the literature [18], as these are well established. For most elements the \ndetection limits are <0.1 mg\/l, the Al detection limits are <1 mg\/L \n \n 6\n3.Results \nIn all experiments the control solution (i.e.subjected to the same stirring but with no addition of solid) \nproduced no detectable change in the concentration of the analytes (i.e. within the precision of the \nmeasurements) through the 60 minute experiments. As the solid to mine water ratio increased an \naccelerated rate of removal of contaminants from solution was clearly observed. This is illustrated in \nFigure 2 which shows that low solid concentrations only have a minor effect on the water chemistry, but \nonce the concentration reaches 1g\/L the effect is clearly demonstrated. A similar effect was observed in \nmost other experiments. To simplify the rest of the data presentation of the batch experiments, Figures \n3-7 show only the 5 g\/L solid experimental data. The full data set can be found in the supplementary \ndata.  \nFigure 2 at this point \nEach of Figures 3-7 presents relative concentration over time; i.e. the concentration is presented as the \npercentage of the initial concentration, which allows easy comparison of individual elements. Figures 3-\n7 show a selection of analytes, which reflect the contamination issues of each site. Table 1 shows the pH \nchanges which occurred during the experiments. The pH changes are critical to the elemental \nconcentration changes in these waters, and are discussed in Section 4.1.  \nTable 1 at this point \n3.1 Parys Mountain. Figure 3 shows the response of the Parys Mountain water (<0.1 \u00b5m filtrate) to \nthe addition of 5 g\/L of each solid material. The FG has little effect on the removal of Fe, Zn or Cu; \nafter 60 minutes only 15, 2 and 0%  respectively, were removed from solution. The use of DGR and \nWGR gave a decrease of over 80% for each element after the 60 minute experiment. Copper was most \neffectively removed with 100 and 97.5% removal using DGR and WGR, respectively. Figure 3 also \nshows the corresponding changes in pH and  \u2206 mV (calculated mV, from pH change, minus the \nmeasured mV). The \u2206 mV plot shows that the changes in the Eh measured in the experiments are \ndifferent from that predicted from the pH change alone. In the FG experiment the difference is small and \n 7\npositive (more oxidising) whilst the differences in the GR experiments are both strongly negative (more \nreducing). This indicates that the GR exerts a strong reducing effect and further that the drying process \ndoes not remove all of the reducing \u2018potential\u2019 of the GR. \nFigure 3 at this point \nThere are interesting differences in the rates of the removal of Fe and Zn using wet and dried GR. Iron \nis removed much more rapidly using DGR than WGR. In the first 5 minutes of the experiment the \naddition of DGR removed 89% of the Fe whilst the WGR removed only 25% of the Fe. In contrast Zn \nshows the opposite trend, as the WGR removed Zn more rapidly than the DGR. \n3.2 Avoca East. The Avoca East drainage contains appreciable quantities of Fe, Zn, Cu and Al. The \neffect of the solids on the Fe in the solution (<0.1 \u00b5m filtrate) is presented in Figure 4. The FG removes \n62% of the initial concentration and DGR removes 91% of initial concentration in 1 hour. However here \nthe WGR demonstrates some very different effects to those previously described; in the first minute of \nthe experiment the addition of WGR increases the Fe concentration to almost 8 times higher than the \ninitial concentration. The Fe concentration then decreases throughout the experiment, finally removing \nonly 38% of the initial concentration.  \nFigure 4 at this point \nThe behaviour of Fe has an interesting effect on the other contaminants in this solution, especially \nwhen compared to the Parys Mountain water, which has similar pH and contaminant concentrations. \nThe effect of the solids on Zn, Cu and Al is presented in Figure 5. The FG is ineffectual and over the \nhour of the experiment Zn, Cu and Al were removed by no more than 2.5%. It is worthy of note that \nwhile both the DGR and WGR remove Zn, Cu, and Al from solution, it is WGR that acts most quickly, \neven after causing such a dramatic increase in Fe concentration in the first minute of the experiment. In \nthe experiment using DGR, Al decreased by 44% after one minute. In the same time period WGR \nremoved 33% of Zn , 85% of Cu and 90% of Al. After five minutes both the DGR and WGR had \nremoved 100% Al from solution, and after 60 minutes the addition of DGR had caused Zn and Cu \n 8\nconcentrations to reduce by 70 and 96 % respectively, and the WGR caused a decrease of 92 and 95% \nrespectively. \nFigure 5 at this point \n3.3 Avoca West. The FG ochre does not remove any Zn or Al, and only removes 8% of the Fe from \nthe Avoca West water (<1 \u00b5m filtrate). Both forms of GR are effective at removing Fe, Zn and Al, the \nDGR removing 70, 71, and 100% respectively and the WGR removing 87, 85, and 100% respectively \n(see Figure 6). \nFigure 6 at this point \n3.4 Bwlch. The main contaminant issue at the Bwlch site is Zn, which is present at ~20 mg\/L. As \ndiscussed in Section 2.2 FeSO4 was added to the water to give an initial Fe concentration of 40 mg\/L to \nenable formation and precipitation of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides. Figure 7 presents the percentage changes \nin Fe and Zn concentration in the Bwlch water (<0.1 \u00b5m filtrate) as a consequence of adding each solid \nmaterial. The FG produces no change in either Fe or Zn concentration. Both forms of GR produces an \nimmediate (< 1 minute) decrease in Fe and Zn concentration. By the end of the experiment 97 and 91% \nof the Fe has been removed using DGR and WGR respectively, reducing the Fe concentration to ~1.5 \nmg\/L. Figure 7 also shows the corresponding changes in pH and \u2206 mV through the experiments. There \nis an initial reduction step in all tests as a result of the addition of FeSO4.  The \u2206 mV plots reflect \nchanges after the addition of the GR or FG and do not show the initial reduction step. Thus any changes \nin the \u2206 mV reflect the solid additions and not the FeSO4.  The FG causes a slight lowering of the pH \nand a slow increase in the Eh during the experiment. The GR additions both produce relatively steady \nincrease in the pH but have different effects on the Eh.  The DGR causes an initial reduction followed, \nafter 5 minutes, by oxidation whilst the WGR causes a reduction for most of the experiment. The slow \npH increase is caused by the dissolution of the aragonite whilst the Eh changes reflect the oxidation \nkinetics of the GR. \nFigure 7 at this point \n 9\nWhile the added Fe was not completely removed, the addition of either form of GR was very effective \nat removing Zn from solution. Zinc is notoriously difficult to remove from aqueous solutions, and, after \n60 minutes, was reduced by >99% in the Bwlch water by addition of each form of GR. \n3.5 Rates of reaction. Data can be modelled to provide rate constants that describe the effects of the \naddition of solids to the contaminant concentrations in the mine waters. The experiments in this study \npresent complex systems comprising natural waters and natural solids. Thus the rates of reaction do not \ndescribe a simple process, but instead may be a combination of processes of varying and unknown \ndegrees. Indeed Kirby and Elder Brady [19] identified the complexity of natural systems as a problem \nwhen attempting to calculate rate laws. They stated that no single rate law could be developed using \nFe2+, O2 and pH data alone to predict field rates of oxidation and precipitation, given the variety of \nprocesses acting in a natural system. Rate laws are most commonly used for describing simple, closed, \nwell mixed systems [20]. \nHere, rate constants were calculated for each 5 g\/L experiment, as a zero, first or second order rate \nconstant (k value). One rate law alone cannot describe the changes observed during these experiments, \nand this compares with the conclusions of Kirby and Elder Brady [19]. Indeed, in many cases the rate \nlaw fitting the data changed over time. The best fitting rate law was therefore selected individually from \nthe data from each experiment. The k value of the rate law which best represents the data for each \nexperiment (zero, first or second order) are presented in Table 2.  \nTable 2 at this point \nWithout a more detailed knowledge of the individual component reactions within these complex \nsystems it is impossible to present a more detailed mathematical description. However, these rates are \nrepresentative of a natural system requiring remediation. Second order rate constants for the oxidation \nof Fe(II) species by O2 were calculated by Wherli [21] (see Table 3). The data produced in this study \nindicate that the addition of green rust can increase the rate of Fe oxidation and precipitation by up to 7 \norders of magnitude, compared to the data from Wherli [21]. \n 10\nTable 3 at this point \n4.Discussion \nThe concentrations in the control samples remain relatively constant throughout the experiments. \nThese untreated waters may eventually precipitate Fe naturally, removing other contaminants, but this \ncould take days to weeks. In the case of Parys Mountain water, which has a pH value of 2, it is unlikely \nthat any significant precipitation will take place. In contrast to the rapid removal rates shown by GR in \nthe batch experiments completed here. The coal mine drainage ochre, a ferrihydrite\/goethite (FG) \nmixture, is generally ineffective as an aid to removing contaminants from the mine waters used in this \nstudy and it exhibited limited ability to remove Fe from solution. The addition of GR to mine waters \ncauses a rapid removal of contaminants and a dramatic improvement in the water quality.  \nThe WGR and DGR are both capable of aiding the removal of Fe, Zn, Cu and Al from solution. \nAnalysis of the GR and FG shows that levels of PHEs are generally less than 5 mg\/kg and thus the \ndissolution of the solids would not contaminate the waters. In general the DGR is most effective at \nremoving Fe from solution and the WGR is most effective at removing the other contaminants. Since \nboth GR materials contain the same amount of aragonite this effect cannot be attributed to changes in \npH alone. Data presented here shows that the Eh of the solutions is affected by the addition of GR to the \nmine waters. \n4.1 Mechanisms. The addition of GRs to waters aids the removal of metallic contaminants in at least \nthree ways. Firstly, the GR sample used here contains ~60% (w\/w) aragonite\n. \nDissolution of this \naragonite increases the pH of acidic mine drainage, exceeding the pH of hydrolysis of Fe at higher \nconcentrations of added solid. The Parys Mountain (PM) water was initially pH 2, but after addition of \nDGR or WGR (5 g\/L) the pH was raised to 5.5-6, encouraging some Fe oxyhydroxide precipitation \nwhich counteracts the pH increase by the release of protons. In one set of experiments the effect of \ncalcium carbonate addition alone was investigated by adding the equivalent mass of CaCO3 to the PM \nwater. The results show an  increase in pH comparable to the GR but the Eh value is consistently higher \n 11\nthan the GR. These data are reported in the supplementary material.  In addition a marginal pH increase \n(up to pH 7.5-8) in Zn-rich circum-neutral waters could cause the formation of the stable zinc carbonate \nmineral smithsonite (ZnCO3) [22] or possibly Zn (OH)2 . This could be why the addition of DGR and \nWGR are equally as effective at removing Zn from the Bwlch water. However it should be pointed out \nthat the pH increase for the WGR experiment is relatively slow compared to the rapid removal of zinc \n(c.f. figure 7). It is noteworthy that the Eh of the experiments showed rapid changes following the \naddition of the FeSO4 solution at the start of the experiment. The Eh value was lowered even further by \nthe addition of either the DGR or WGR on a timescale which is comparable to the removal of Zn and \nthus it seems reasonable to assign this removal to an Eh as well as a pH change. \nSecondly, the GR provides extra sites for sorption of Fe and other elements. It has been shown that \nsequential removal of suspended particles from contaminated mine water can slow the precipitation of \nFe and thus an increase of particulate matter will increase Fe precipitation [15]. This is confirmed in this \nstudy by the observation that higher concentrations of GR added to the waters had a greater effect, both \nin terms of increased rate and concentration removed (see supplementary data). \nThe third method of water quality improvement is by the process of surface-catalysed oxidation of \nferrous iron (SCOOFI) [23]. The added solid material serves as a catalyst for the increased oxidation of \nFe2+ in solution. Oxidation of Fe2+ by SCOOFI is more rapid than oxidation by dissolved O2 alone [23]. \nSCOOFI explains why the DGR was more effective at removing Fe than WGR, in which only 40% of \nthe Fe was Fe (III). In many cases the WGR became oxidised during the experiment, especially at the \nlower concentrations. Dissolved oxygen from the waters caused the oxidation of WGR and once the Fe \nwas Fe III, SCOOFI could commence. The high additions of WGR (5g\/L) to the acidic Parys Mountain \nwater were not affected by oxidation from the water, yet were more effective at removing Fe and other \ncontaminants. This could be because neutralisation and providing sites for sorption were dominant over \nSCOOFI. The change in Eh observed for the F\/G addition to the Bwlch water (Figure 3) also indicate \nthat some SCOOFI reactions are occurring in this experiment. \n 12\nDespite WGR being less effective at removing Fe from the <0.1 \u00b5m filtrate, it was more effective at \naiding the removal of other elements, especially in high concentrations of added solid. Providing extra \nsites for sorption is more important for co-precipitation than the SCOOFI process. The reduced nature of \nthe GR could also cause speciation changes in the contaminants leading to more insoluble forms \n[3,24,25]. \nThe advantages of re-cycling ochre in remediation works was discovered in the 1970s. It was \ndeveloped to encourage a higher density ochreous sludge [26]. The increased settling rates of added \nsolid material over control experiments are evident in the current study and confirm that a denser waste \nproduct is produced. The added advantage of the current study is that by using GR there is no need to \nuse additional chemicals to encourage ochre precipitation to commence. \nIt is known that mine water samples can be stabilised effectively in the short term by removing \nsuspended particles [15]. Such particles provide sites for sorption and SCOOFI. The experiments \nreported here were designed to find out whether the addition of ochreous particles to mine water could \nproduce an improvement in water quality. The most effective solid material used in these experiments, \nGR is an example of a waste product which can be recycled to increase efficiency of remediation \ntreatment. With a more complete knowledge of GR and its formation the concept outlined in this study \ncan be taken further. The formation of GR could be encouraged with the right Eh\/pH conditions, \nmicrobial influence, and water and ochre chemistry. This could be done in a settling pond at the \ntreatment works, and the GR produced could then be used in the treatment system. This would negate or \nreduce the need for neutralising and flocculating chemicals. This has the potential to improve the \nefficiency and cost of active treatment. Furthermore the evidence presented here shows that GR can be \ndried and stabilised yet retain its effectiveness allowing the material to be easily transported to other \nmine treatment sites. \n \nAcknowledgments \n 13\nThis paper is published by the permission of the Executive Director, British Geological Survey.
