Its continued existence in many countries of the \nworld creates political tensions within these countries and between governments of retentionist \nand abolitionist countries. After the Second World War, more and more countries have abolished \nthe death penalty. This article argues that the major determinants of this global trend toward \nabolition are political, a claim which receives support in a quantitative cross-national analysis \nfrom 1950 to 2002. Democracy, democratization, international political pressure on retentionist \ncountries and peer group effects in relatively abolitionist regions all raise the likelihood of \nabolition. There is also a partisan effect as abolition becomes more likely if the chief executive\u2019s \nparty is left-wing oriented. Cultural, social and economic determinants receive only limited \nsupport. The global trend toward abolition will go on if democracy continues to spread around \nthe world and abolitionist countries stand by their commitment to press for abolition all over the \nworld. \n2 \nUntil rather recently, almost all countries applied the death penalty as a punishment for \ncriminals, traitors, political prisoners and other people, sometimes entirely innocent of the \ncharges against them. In the late 19th and early 20th century a few countries abolished the death \npenalty, but most of the countries that have revoked capital punishment have done so after the \nSecond World War (Schabas 1997; Hood 2001). Since then, there has been an increasing trend \ntoward abolition of the death penalty \u2013 a trend, which gained particular momentum in the 1990s. \nBut can we expect this global abolitionist trend to continue or is it likely to stop soon? Schabas \n(1997) and Fijalkowski (2001) are optimistic, but Radzinowicz (1999: 293) does \u2018not expect any \nsubstantial further decrease in the appointment and use of capital punishment in the near future\u2019 \nsince \u2018most of the countries likely to embrace the abolitionist cause have by now done so\u2019 \n(similarly Dun\u00e9r and Geurtsen 2002: 19). This article argues that the global trend toward \nabolition is mainly politically determined rather than by cultural, social and economic factors. \nMore specifically, it argues that the continuation of the abolitionist trend is contingent on a \nfurther spread of democracy around the world, on political pressure imposed on retentionist \ncountries, on regional peer group effects and on the political balance between conservative and \nleft-wing parties within countries. \nThe death penalty is like no other punishment. It is the ultimate, most consequential and \ntotally irreversible penalty. Not surprisingly, it is also the politically most controversial form of \npunishment. Its continued existence in many countries of the world is contested by human rights \ngroups, criminologists, some political parties and others sometimes within and often outside the \ncountry applying the death penalty. The execution of foreigners who are citizens of abolitionist \ncountries commonly creates political tensions between governments. Members of the European \nUnion (EU), but also other countries routinely intervene if one of their nationals is facing the \n3 \nthreat of death penalty in another country. Abolitionist countries from Western Europe and other \nregions typically do not extradite prisoners, own citizens or not, to countries like the United \nStates (US), unless it is guaranteed that they will not be executed. This is true even if the \nprisoners are suspected or convicted terrorists (EU 2002). Political conflict is particularly severe \nwhere nations otherwise share similar cultural and political values. Zimring (2003, p. 181) argues \nthat the US and European countries \u2018are now farther divided on the question of capital \npunishment than on any other morally significant question of government policy\u2019. This was of \ncourse written before the Iraq war, but it points toward how capital punishment divides countries \nthat are otherwise close allies. \nThe continued existence of the death penalty in many countries is therefore an immensely \npolitical and controversial issue. Surprisingly, scholars and political scientists in particular have \nnot paid much attention to explaining the determinants of death penalty abolition across the \nworld. Like Jacobs and Carmichael (2002) we find the dearth of systematic research into the \ndeterminants of death penalty abolition most astonishing. It stands in contrast to the importance \nattached to the justification for punishment (Matravers 1999) and the political controversies \ngenerated by the existence of capital punishment. It also stands in stark contrast to the many \nempirical studies, which have demonstrated how racial and social discrimination influences the \nimposition of the death sentence particularly in the US, and the many studies addressing the \nalleged deterrent effect of capital punishment (see, for example, Keil and Vito (1989), Peterson \nand Bailey (1991), Beiley (1998) and the many studies reviewed in Hood (1998; 2002)). At the \ncross-national level, there exist only very few analyses by criminologists (Killias 1986; \nWiechman, Kendall and Bae 1990) and sociologists (Neapolitan 2001; Greenberg and West \n2003). None of these studies employs multivariate regression analysis, with the exception of \n4 \nGreenberg and West (2003) and even this study is purely cross-sectional. It thus cannot analyze \nthe determinants of death penalty abolition since it does not use information on the explanatory \nvariables at the time of abolition. At the sub-national level, Jacobs and Carmichael (2002), two \nsociologists, examine the determinants of whether the death penalty is legally existent in the 50 \nstates of the United States (US) in the years 1971, 1981 and 1991, while Jacobs and Carmichael \n(2004) additionally address the number of executions from around the same time period. \nIn the next section we demonstrate the global trend towards abolition of the death penalty. \nWe then analyze the political foundations behind this trend. To demonstrate empirically the \nrelevance of these foundations we need to control for other determinants of death penalty \nabolition and therefore discuss cultural, social and economic factors. A description of the \nresearch design is followed by the presentation of results, which are then subjected to sensitivity \nanalysis. The concluding section answers the question whether the worldwide trend towards \nabolition can be expected to continue with a cautious yes. \n \nTHE GLOBAL TREND TOWARDS ABOLITION OF THE DEATH PENALTY \nComplete abolition of the death penalty is not a consistent country practice (Short 1999). The \nmajority of countries have not abolished the penalty for all crimes. Some more have abolished it \nfor ordinary crimes only. The latter typically exclude crimes of treason and other crimes \ncommitted during wartime. A few might be considered as de facto abolitionist since they have \nnot executed anyone for some time, whilst many remain retentionist. \nVenezuela in 1863 was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty for all \ncrimes (Hood 2001). Several South American and Western European countries were similarly \nfrontrunners in abolishing the death penalty, at least for ordinary crimes. Once the death penalty \n5 \nbecomes abolished by law or constitutional change it is unlikely to come back. Italy is one of the \nfew exceptions, where the death penalty became abolished early on in 1889, honoring Cesare \nBeccaria\u2019s (1995 [1764]) path-breaking call for death penalty abolition, but was re-instated under \nMussolini rule in 1926 and became applicable again for ordinary crimes in 1930. Some states of \nthe US have also abolished capital punishment for some time, only to re-introduce it later. \nTables 1 and 2 show in chronological order, which countries abandoned in which period the \ndeath penalty for all crimes and for ordinary crimes. One might think that the distinction between \nthe two types of abolition does not make much difference in reality. However, Schabas (1997: \n300) warns against such complacency in stating that \u2018it is in time of war when the greatest abuse \nof the death penalty occurs, criteria of expediency and State terror stampeding panicked \ngovernments towards inhumane excesses unthinkable in time of peace\u2019. Similarly, the risk of \njudicial error and therefore of killing innocent people is much higher in times of war (Marchesi \n1996). Given the declaration of a \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d after 9\/11 there is also the possibility that \ncapital punishment might be increasingly applied on politically motivated offenders in countries \nthat have abolished the death penalty for ordinary, but not for all crimes. \n< Insert Tables 1 and 2 about here > \nThe tables show that abolition has been mainly a phenomenon of the second half of the last \ncentury with an increasing trend towards the end of it. The 1990s in particular have been a truly \nabolitionist decade with a diverse range of countries from all over the world revoking capital \npunishment. Of course, the increase is partly due to the increasing number of sovereign \ncountries. The tables therefore also show the percentage of state members of the interstate \nsystem, as listed in Singer (2003), that have abolished the death penalty. The 1960s was a decade \nin which the retentionist countries could increase their relative share despite some countries \n6 \njoining the abolitionist camp. This is because many countries became independent without \nsimultaneous abolition of the death penalty. After that, however, an increasing trend towards \nabolition is clearly discernible also in relative terms. Another interesting fact is that even though \nmany countries have totally abolished the death penalty for all crimes in one go, quite a few \ncountries have been much more hesitant to abolish the death penalty for all crimes than for \nordinary crimes only. For example, Portugal and the Netherlands abolished the death penalty for \nordinary crimes in 1867 and 1870, but for all crimes only in 1976 and 1982, respectively. \nThe most problematic and vague category is that of countries considered to have abolished \nthe death penalty de facto rather than de jure. This means that whilst capital punishment is still \ncontained within the country\u2019s legal system, no person has been executed for some period of \ntime. However, because no explicit and legally binding end has been set to capital punishment, \nsome of these countries revert again to applying the death penalty. Hood (2001: 335) reports that \nafter 1994 eight countries previously considered de facto abolitionist resumed executing people. \nTable 3 provides a list of countries considered by Amnesty International (2006) to be de facto \nabolitionist in September 2006. The criterion employed by Amnesty International (2006) is that a \ncountry has \u2018not executed anyone during the past 10 years\u2019 and is believed to \u2018have a policy or \nestablished practice of not carrying out executions\u2019. \nThe remaining countries are called retentionist. Table 3 also provides a list of countries thus \nconsidered by Amnesty International (2006) in September 2006. There are large differences in \nthe application and administration of the death penalty among retentionist countries (UN-\nECOSOC 2001). In some countries people can only be sentenced to death for the most serious \ncrimes, typically murder, whereas in other countries drug producers and traffickers and those \ncommitting sexual and even economic crimes can be sentenced to death. Some countries go as \n7 \nfar as using the death penalty as a threat against what the law regards socially or religiously \nundesirable behavior. For example, in Iran adultery, sodomy, homosexuality and sexual relations \nbetween a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man could lead to capital punishment (Hood \n2002). In some countries, the convicted can be juveniles or insane, the death penalty can be \nmandatory for various types of crimes and the legal safeguards can differ dramatically across \ncountries (ibid.). \n< Insert Table 3 about here > \nA few countries execute a great many people, whereas most retentionist countries execute \nonly few. According to cases known to Amnesty International (2006), during 2005 by far the \ngreatest number of executions took place in China and together with Iran, Saudi Arabia and the \nUnited States, the four countries accounted for 94 per cent of all known executions in that year. \nIn per capita terms, however, Turkmenistan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and Belarus have been the \nmajor executing countries in the period 1994 to 1998 (Hood 2001: 336).1 During 2005, at the \nsame time as at least 2148 people were executed in 22 countries, at least 5186 people were \nsentenced to death in 53 countries (Amnesty International 2006). This shows another typical \nfeature of retentionist countries: many more people are sentenced to death than are executed. In \nthe United States, for example, the number of prisoners on death row has increased from 691 in \n1980 to 3373 in 2005 (Death Penalty Information Center 2006). Hood (1998) estimates that \nabout three times more people would have to be executed than actually are to prevent the number \nof prisoners on death row growing further.2 \n \n                                                 \n1\n Since then, however, Turkmenistan has abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 1999. \n2\n 60 people were executed in the United States in 2005 (Amnesty International 2006). \n8 \nTHE POLITICAL FOUNDATIONS OF DEATH PENALTY ABOLITION \nWhat drives the global trend toward death penalty abolition? This section will discuss its \npolitical foundations. These cover democracy, democratization, the political balance within \ncountries between left-wing and right-wing parties, historical experience of armed conflict and \nthe political pressure imposed by abolitionist on retentionist countries as well as regional peer \ngroup effects. \nMany abolitionists argue that the institution of the death penalty violates fundamental \nhuman rights. For example, the EU regards the death penalty nowadays as a \u2018denial of human \ndignity\u2019 and holds \u2018that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to (\u2026) the progressive \ndevelopment of human rights\u2019 (EU 2000a). From this perspective, abolition of the death penalty \nis the logical result of a process of humanizing the penal system \u2013 either in its benign version \nforming part of a process of civilization and modernization analyzed by Elias (1982) or in its less \nbenign Foucaultian (1997) version contributing to the sophistication of power and control as the \npenal system moves from violent punishment in the open to penitentiary correction behind \nclosed prison doors. \nIf the severity of punishment is a human rights issue and the death penalty really is a \nbarbaric punishment and the \u2018archetypal form of State-authorized premeditated homicide\u2019, as \nSchabas (1997: 295) argues, then democracies can also be expected to be more willing to abolish \nthe death penalty than autocracies. This is because democracies, almost by definition, are more \nwilling to accept constitutional limits on governmental power and one would at least expect them \nto respect better the human rights of their citizens. Along the same line of reasoning, it is not \nsurprising that, with the exception of the United States, the countries making the most vigorous \nuse of the death penalty are dictatorships. Burt (1994: 90) provides a different argument on the \n9 \nlink between democracy and abolition when he maintains that the \u2018democratic principle, properly \nunderstood, is inherently inconsistent with the practice\u2019 of capital punishment since the death \npenalty rejects the democratic principle of equal citizenship and the (theoretical) possibility of \nreconciliation among adversaries. Brettschneider (2002) similarly argues that the death penalty \nviolates human dignity derived from free and equal citizenship in a democratic regime. Another \nreason why democracy might have a positive impact upon abolition is that the alleged deterrent \neffect of the death penalty is arguably strongest if the penalty is mandatory and applied without \nexception for certain types of crimes. Hood (1998: 763) argues that this \u2018is not an option for \ndemocratic states bound by the rule of law and concern for humanity and respect for human \nrights\u2019. Sarat (2001) pushes this argument further in expressing his concern that the practice of \ncapital punishment undermines the legal values and the institutions constituent of democracy \n(see also Garland 2002). \nAs a corollary, democratization, that is a regime change towards democracy, is often an \nimportant factor advancing the abolition of the death penalty. Germany, for example, took this \nstep when it became democratic again in 1949. Some Eastern European countries such as \nRomania and the Czech and Slovak Republics abolished the death penalty soon after their \ndemocratic transition in the late 1980s. South Africa abolished the death penalty during its \ntransition from the Apartheid to a democratic regime in the 1990s despite a high and rising rate \nof violent crime. In such regime transitions, abolition of the death penalty often serves as a \nconscious act of distancing the new democracy from the old regime. Human rights assume a \nfocal point in such transitions, which provides an ideal environment for abolition. A positive \neffect of democracy and democratization on abolition of the death penalty would fit well into the \nhypothesis of a domestic democratic peace, i.e., the proposition that democracies are more \n10 \nrespectful of human rights than non-democracies. Evidence suggests that democracy has a \nnegative impact on repression of human rights to personal integrity (Poe, Tate and Keith 1999), \nif perhaps only after a certain threshold of democracy has been reached (Davenport and \nArmstrong 2004). \nA caveat to keep in mind concerning the positive effect of democracy on abolition is that \nleadership by the political elite is important since in many countries abolition has been achieved \nagainst the majority opinion of the people (Zimring and Hawkins 1986; Hood 2001; Dun\u00e9r and \nGeurtsen 2002). This also suggests that any positive link between democracy and abolition is not \ncaused by the fact that democracies are more accountable to the will of the people. Rather, what \nmatters is that in most (full) democracies the political elite is willing to grant inviolable rights to \nall individuals, even if they are criminals, and to ignore public opinion, which might at times \nremain in favor of the death penalty (Marshall 2000). The EU (2000b) contends that even the \nworst criminal offenders \u2018also enjoy an inherent and inalienable dignity\u2019 that is violated if they \nare put to death. American politicians are no less accountable to their voters than their European \ncounterparts. The unique character of state-determined criminal law and substantial laymen \nparticipation and influence on the extent of punitiveness of the criminal sanction system might \nprovide hints why many states in the US maintain the death penalty and execute a great number \nof people (Zimring, Hawkins and Kamin 2001). And yet, if we follow Foucault (1977) and take \nthe employed penal technology itself seriously, then the trend towards more \u201chumane\u201d, \n\u201ccivilized\u201d and physically painless executions in the US and other retentionist democracies might \nsignal that in these countries even advocates of the death penalty somehow understand that there \nis a fundamental conflict between capital punishment and the human rights and dignity typically \nafforded to citizens in democracies. \n11 \nCountries governed by right-wing governments can be expected to be less pro-abolitionist \nthan countries governed by left-wing governments (conservative versus liberal in the American \nusage of terms). This is because right-wing politicians and right-wing oriented voters are more \nlikely to believe in the social usefulness of harsh punishment, regarding offenders as individuals \nfully responsible for their crimes (Lakoff 1996; Garland 2001). Pennington (2000) argues that \nleft-wing political parties in English-speaking countries outside the US have often established a \nmoratorium on the death penalty and have afterwards obstructed attempts by right-wing parties \nto bring the death penalty back in use. Another indication of the importance of partisanship on \npenal policy is that Sutton (2000) found that right-wing political party strength is positively \nassociated with growth of imprisonment in five common-law democracies over the period 1955 \nto 1985. The same is true within the United States for Republican party strength, as shown by \nJacobs and Helms (1997) and Jacobs and Carmichael (2001). Indeed, for this sub-national level \nJacobs and Carmichael (2002) demonstrate a positive link between Republican party strength \nand the legal existence of the death penalty.  \nA further political dimension is suggested by the fact pointed out in the last section that \nmany countries maintain, for some time at least, the death penalty for offences committed during \nwartime even if they have abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes. Countries, which have \nexperienced a longer history of warfare are likely to be more reluctant to abolish the death \npenalty for all crimes (Dun\u00e9r and Geurtsen 2002). Conversely, in countries, which have a long \nhistory of peace and are not likely to face war in the future, it makes less sense to retain the death \npenalty for treason and similar offences.3 \n                                                 \n3\n Note, however, that in some cases the excessive application of the death penalty during war time can prompt a \ncountry to abolish totally the death penalty after a regime transition. This is what happened to Germany after the \nSecond World War when abolition formed an integral part of the new democratic constitution. \n12 \nIn addition to these domestic political determinants, retentionist countries came under \nincreasing international pressure from the late 1970s onwards when abolitionist countries started \nto argue more vigorously than before that the death penalty amounts to a violation of \nfundamental and universally accepted human rights and should therefore be abandoned all over \nthe world. Non-state actors and trans-national advocacy groups like amnesty international or \nHuman Rights Watch have played a very important role not only in the development of the \ninternational human rights regime in general (Risse, Ropp and Sikkink 1999), but more \nspecifically also in defining the death penalty as a human rights issue and in lobbying for its \nabolition worldwide. Once the death penalty is established as a violation of universal human \nrights, truly committed abolitionist countries will no longer be content with abolition in their \nown country only. The EU (2000a), for example, declares that it is \u2018opposed to the death penalty \nin all cases and accordingly aims at its universal abolition\u2019. Its 1998 Guidelines to EU Policy \nTowards Third Countries on the Death Penalty explicitly states that it \u2018has now moved beyond\u2019 \nabolition within its own political jurisdiction and \u2018espouses abolition for itself and others\u2019 (EU, \n1998). This represents the final stage of a development that took EU countries over time from \npurely domestic abolition in the beginning to increasingly more active and universalist \nabolitionist policies in the 1990s. \nBefore the 1970s retentionist countries were more successful in their claim that the death \npenalty had nothing at all to do with universally accepted human rights and was entirely an \ninternal domestic affair of penal policy.4 In 1977, a United Nations General Assembly resolution \n                                                 \n4\n Still today, as Wyman (1997) and Dun\u00e9r and Geurtsen (2002) point out, cultural relativists and with \nthem many non-Western governments like to argue that the abolition of the death penalty is a Western \nconcept alien to other cultures. \n13 \ncalled for a restriction of the number of offences that could lead to capital punishment \u2018with a \nview to the desirability of abolishing the punishment\u2019 (quoted in Hood 1998: 743) confirming a \nsimilar earlier resolution passed in 1971 (Wyman 1997: 548).5 Since then, important milestones \nfor the international abolitionist movement have been the Second Optional Protocol to the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations General \nAssembly in 1989, the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights, adopted by the \nGeneral Assembly of the Organization of American States in 1990 and the Protocols No. 6 and \nNo. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1982 \nand 2002, respectively. Of these international treaties, the Protocol No. 13 to the European \nConvention on Human Rights is the only one that demands abolition of the death penalty for all \ncrimes, whereas the others allow parties to retain the penalty in time of war. The totally \nabolitionist countries have typically accepted the latter in order to induce more countries to join \nthese treaties with the hope that all treaty members would eventually abolish the death penalty \nfor all crimes as well. \nAccession to these international treaties is voluntary, but abolitionist countries try to \npersuade others to join. Western European countries used political pressure more than persuasion \nto bring retentionist Eastern European countries in the 1990s over into the abolitionist camp. The \nleverage Western European countries used to promote their political goal of advancing abolition \nof the death panelty was the desire of Eastern European country governments to join, for both \neconomic and political reasons, the Council of Europe. For many, accession to the Council of \nEurope was also seen as boosting their chances for eventual EU membership or accession to the \n                                                 \n5\n Similar points are regularly raised in reports and resolutions of the UN Commission on Human Rights. \nWithin the Commission abolitionist and  \n14 \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (Bantekas and Hodgkinson 2000; Fawn 2001; \nFijalkowski 2001). From the early 1990s onwards the Council stated that abolition of the death \npenalty is, in the words of its then President Daniel Tarschys, one of the \u2018top priorities\u2019 of the \norganization (cited in Fawn 2001: 69). In 1996 the Council of Europe proclaimed formally that a \ndeath penalty moratorium is an essential condition for accession to the Council of Europe with \ncomplete abolition to be followed within three years (ibid.). \nMore generally, countries are likely to be influenced by the decisions of their regional peers \nwith respect to death penalty abolition. If many countries within a region have abolished the \ndeath penalty, pressure mounts on the remaining retentionist ones. Conversely, if few countries \nwithin a region have abolished the penalty, opponents of abolition will find it easier to defend \ntheir position and to reject criticism from domestic and foreign abolitionists. Such regional \npolicy contagion dynamics working via communication, learning, imitation and altered \nreputational payoffs are well established in the literature on the diffusion of economic policies \n(Simmons and Elkins 2004). They are likely to exist for other policies as well, including penal \nones, which will be tested in this study. Within regions there is also greater cross-border \ntemporary and permanent migration, which raises the pressure on remaining retentionist \ncountries to abolish the death penalty in order to avoid potential political conflicts between the \ngovernments of regional neighbors over such sensitive issues as the execution of one\u2019s national \ncitizens abroad or the extradition of foreigners threatened with the death penalty in the country \nrequesting extradition. \n \n15 \nOTHER DETERMINANTS OF DEATH PENALTY ABOLITION \nOf course, political factors are not the only determinants of death penalty abolition. Some stress \nthe cultural character of punishment in general and of the death penalty in particular (Garland \n1990; Sarat and Boulanger 2005). Culture is a rather vague concept, but certain legal and \nreligious traditions can influence whether the death penalty is considered a culturally accepted \npart of the penal system. The United Kingdom and other countries, whose legal system is based \non English common law, have been late in abolishing the death penalty or still remain \nretentionist. This is not merely coincidental. In the 19th century the death penalty was a common \nform of punishment in England with an execution rate well above that of other European \ncountries (Bailey 2000). With the spread of the Empire, English common law and with it the \ndeath penalty also spread to other countries. Radzinowicz (1999: 284) points out that English \nliberals of the 19th century, including John Stuart Mill, have been much more reluctant to support \nabolition or even restrictions on the use of the death penalty than their continental European \ncounterparts. Abolitionists during that time denounced England as \u2018the most merciless of \nChristian countries\u2019 claiming that \u2018in no other country in the civilized world were the laws \nrelating to capital punishment so backward and so unsatisfactory as our own\u2019 (cited in \nRadzinowicz and Hood 1986: 672). In common law \u2018the customs of the people provide the \noriginal source of law\u2019 (Newman 1999: 67) rather than the decisions of rulers and legislators. \nThis together with the popularity of the death penalty among the general populace might partly \nexplain why the death penalty remains an accepted form of punishment in many common law \ncountries. \nWhether Islamic law represents a distinct category of legal system is contested (see Newman \n1999), but undoubtedly religion has an enormous influence on the penal law in predominantly \n16 \nIslamic societies, even in those who do not strictly apply Sharia. The rulers in some Islamic \ncountries are outspoken in their conviction that the death penalty is in accordance with their \ncountry\u2019s cultural tradition and religion. The Sudanese representative to the UN in 1994 is \nquoted by Hood (1996: 26) as stating: \u2018Capital punishment is a divine right of some religions. It \nis embodied in Islam and these views must be respected\u2019. Similarly, the Omani representative is \nquoted by Dun\u00e9r and Geurtsen (2002: 14) as maintaining that the abolition of the death penalty is \n\u2018inconsistent with the legal system of the Islamic countries\u2019. We would therefore expect that \npredominantly Islamic societies are not very likely to have abolished the death penalty. No other \nreligion than Islam has a similarly clear message on capital punishment or a comparably strong \ninfluence on politics and the penal system in many countries of the world (Greenberg and West \n2003).6 For this reason, we only include a variable for Islamic strength in the estimations below. \nBesides cultural factors, sociologists have long since argued that social divisions can also be \nexpected to affect the penal system. Some argue that punishment is mainly about social control \nby the elites over the lower classes (Chambliss and Seidman 1971; Garland 1990). The death \npenalty is the ultimate demonstration of the state\u2019s claim to the power over the life of its citizens \n(Wyman 1997; Sarat 2001: 154). Where the social elites feel under threat from the lower social \nclasses, the death penalty can be a powerful instrument within a broader policy of social control \nand exploitation (Chambliss 1999). Early socialists and Marxist scholars regarded the death \npenalty as an instrument of the ruling bourgeoisie to suppress the proletariat (Rusche and \nKirchheimer 1939; Radzinowicz 1999: 286). The same reasoning can be extended to the \nrelationship between an ethnic majority and minorities. The death penalty might therefore be \n                                                 \n6\n Religious arguments have of course been employed in favor of the death penalty by representative of other \ndenominations as well. \n17 \nmore likely to exist in economically more unequal and ethnically, racially or culturally more \ndiverse countries (Linebaugh 1995; Ruddell and Urbina 2004). A tough stance on combating \ncrime with the ultimate punishment available can be used to divert attention from these social \nand ethnic divisions (Garland 2001). Ruddell and Urbina (2004) provide some tentative evidence \nsuggesting that more diverse countries have higher incarceration rates and are less likely to have \nabolished the death penalty. \nIn a similar vein, where violent crime and homicide rates are very high, the perceived threat \nmight be more likely to be answered by the ultimate punishment (Otterbein 1986). This might be \nfor reasons of either retribution or deterrence, which are the two major justifications employed \nby defenders of the death penalty besides expressing moral indignation about the punishable \noffence (Ehrlich 1977; Hood 1998; Wynarczyk 1999; Galliher and Galliher 2002). The latter, i.e. \npunishment understood as society\u2019s collective moral expression of condemnation can be traced \nback to Durkheim (1947 [1893]). In economically or ethnically divided societies, the lack of \nsocial trust might provide particularly fertile ground for public calls for severe punishment of \ncriminals (Whitman 2003). \nEconomic theory would predict that economic development renders death penalty abolition \nmore likely if one assumes that abolition is what is called a normal good, that is, a good for \nwhich demand increases with rising income. Palmer and Henderson (1998: 242) find it \u2018plausible \nthat as both individuals and societies on average become wealthier, they are unwilling explicitly \nto impose some of the more cruel and unusual forms of punishment on criminals\u2019 to which the \ndeath penalty might belong. However, studies of the determinants of support for the death \npenalty in the US generally show that individuals with higher income are more likely to support \n18 \ncapital punishment (Soss, Langbein and Metelko 2003). The impact of economic development as \nmeasured by an increase in average income levels is therefore ambiguous. \n \nRESEARCH DESIGN \nTHE DEPENDENT VARIABLES \nWe analyze the determinants of death penalty abolition. In principle, one could also analyze the \nnumber of executions as well as other aspects of the application of the death penalty, but data \nlimitations mean that this can hardly be done in practice for a global sample. For the same \nreason, our analysis cannot distinguish among retentionist countries even though, as mentioned \nabove, there are substantial differences in the extent of which and in the way of which the death \npenalty is applied in actual reality. We analyze the determinants of death penalty abolition, not \nthe determinants of variation in death penalty application among retentionist countries.  \nIt is not entirely clear how the United States should be coded. This is because it is only \npartly retentionist since states are by and large free in their decision to adopt the death penalty or \nnot and there is no death penalty in 13 states (Death Penalty Information Center 2006). To my \nknowledge, no other country in the world is in a similar situation. I decided to code the US as \nretentionist given that the vast majority of states are retentionist. Dropping the US from the \nsample instead hardly affects the results reported below, which is not surprising given that the \nUS is of course only one out of a great many countries in the world. \nThe period of study starts in 1950 and ends in 2002 as most explanatory variables are not \navailable before or after. We distinguish between abolition of the death penalty for all crimes and \nfor ordinary crimes only. We do not analyze de facto abolition for two reasons. First, as \nmentioned above it is a somewhat vague category and it is unclear from when onwards exactly a \n19 \ncountry can be called de facto abolitionist. Second, whilst we have information on countries that \nare currently considered de facto abolitionist, we have no complete information on which \ncountries were temporarily regarded de facto abolitionist during our period of study. \nOur dependent variables measure the duration of time elapsed from 1950 or, if later, the year \nthe country became independent to the year abolition occurs, if it occurs at all. Time is measured \nin discrete rather than continuous form since the explanatory variables are only available \nannually. The data are taken from Amnesty International (2006) and complemented by \ninformation provided by Hood (2001). Note that a country that has abolished the death penalty \nfor all crimes is also counted as having abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes since one \nencompasses the other. \n \nTHE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES \nDemocracy and democratization have been suggested as major political factors driving death \npenalty abolition. Data from the Polity IV project are taken as our measure of Democracy \n(Marshall, Jaggers and Gurr 2003). This index is based on expert judgment on aspects of \ninstitutionalized democracy and autocracy within a country, both measured on an additive 0 to \n10 scale. The autocracy score is deducted from the democracy score to create a variable that runs \nfrom \u201310 to 10. The same source also provides an indicator of Democratic transition for the \nentire period of transition, which can be longer than one year. This indicator ranges from 3 (a \nmajor democratic transition) to \u20132 (adverse regime transition toward autocracy). \nTo see whether left-wing political orientation has a positive effect on abolition, a dummy \nvariable was set to one if the chief executive\u2019s party was considered left-wing by the World \nBanks\u2019 (2002) Database of Political Institutions (mainly communist, socialist and social \n20 \ndemocratic parties). Unfortunately, data for this variable called Left-wing executive is only \navailable between 1975 and 2000. To measure the impact of historical experience with armed \npolitical conflict on death penalty abolition for all crimes we use data from the Uppsala Project \n(Gleditsch et al. 2002). Our variable measures the number of years that have passed since the last \nincident of an armed political conflict with at least 25 casualties (peace years). The longer a \ncountry has enjoyed peace, the more likely we expect it to be willing to abolish the death penalty \nfor all crimes. \nTo test the impact that Western European pressure might have had on the abolition of the \ndeath penalty in Eastern European countries, a dummy variable is set to 1 for the years in which \nthese countries have been members of the Council of Europe (data taken from Council of Europe \n2003).7 The share of abolitionist countries within the region divided by the share of abolitionist \ncountries worldwide is our measure of regional peer group effects (Regional abolition). The \nreason for dividing (normalizing) by the share of abolitionist countries worldwide is to ensure \nthat this variable does not spuriously pick up any time trend following the general global trend \ntoward abolition. The variable thus measures how committed to abolition a region is relative to \nthe world total. Countries are grouped into regions following World Bank classification: Western \nEurope, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Northern Africa and the Middle East, Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, Northern America, Central America and the \nCaribbean, and South America. \nIn order to ensure that any effect these political factors have on death penalty abolition are \nnot merely spurious, we need to control for other factors suggested above. A dummy was set to \n                                                 \n7\n No other regional or supra-national institution has taken a similarly firm view on abolition or has been willing to \nexert its political leverage to a similar extent. \n21 \none if a country\u2019s legal system is based on English Common law with data taken from La Porta et \nal. (1999). To test for the influence of Islam, our variable measures the percentage of Muslims \namong the total population, as provided by Parker (1997). To control for lack of social cohesion \nand the perceived threat from violence we use a measure of ethnic fractionalization, a measure of \nincome inequality and the lagged homicide rate as an indicator of the extent of violent crime. \nVanhanen (1999) bases his measurement of Ethnic fractionalization on three types of ethnic \ngroups, namely groups based on, first, racial differences, second, linguistic, national or tribal \ndifferences and, third, religious differences. Vanhanen takes 100 minus the percentage of the \nlargest group in each type of ethnic group as a proxy for fractionalization in each group and then \nsums the resulting percentages across all three groups to arrive at the aggregate measure of \nfractionalization. Note that this variable is time-invariant and refers to information from the \n1990s. Unfortunately, no time-series information is available, but this variable is unlikely to \nchange much over time.8 The availability of data on income inequality is generally poor and their \nvalidity in cross-country and cross-time comparison is contested (Atkinson and Brandolini \n2001). We use the Gini coefficient measuring the concentration of incomes between the extremes \nof 0 (absolute equality) and 1 (maximum inequality). Data are taken from Galbraith and Kum \n(2003) and UN-WIDER (2000). To increase availability before 1963, when data is especially \npatchy, we take three year averages of the annual data in that period. \nExtremely poor is the availability of homicide data taken from Interpol (various years). The \ndata were converted into Homicide rates per million people with population data from World \n                                                 \n8\n Krain (1997) has calculated a measure of ethnic fractionalization over time, albeit for only 70 countries. The \nmeasures at ten-year intervals between 1948 and 1978 are all correlated at 0.98 or higher, which demonstrates that \nthis variable hardly changes over time. \n22 \nBank (2003). To increase availability we take three year averages of the annual data. Of all the \nexplanatory variables, the homicide rate is the one most clearly susceptible to potential \nendogeneity bias even if a deterrent effect of the existence of the death penalty on violent crime \nis far from proven (Hood 1998; 2002). The homicide rate is therefore lagged by five years to \nmitigate any such potential problems. The results reported below are hardly affected if it is not \nlagged. Following Neapolitan\u2019s (1997) judgment that Interpol homicide data are extremely \nunreliable before the 1970s, this variable is included in estimations only together with Left-wing \nexecutive, which is only available from 1975 onwards. This restricts the sample to the period \n1975 onwards, such that no homicide data from before 1970 are used. \nThe level of economic development is measured by the natural log of a country\u2019s average \nper capita income (GDP p.c.). We use data in real prices of 1996 and purchasing power parity \nfrom Heston, Summers and Aten (2002) and extend it from 1998 to 2001 with growth rates data \nfrom World Bank (2003). It is common practice to use per capita income in logged form in \nregression analysis, but our results reported further below are practically identical if the income \nvariable is not logged. \nTable 4 reports descriptive statistics of the variables included in the regressions. \n< Insert Table 4 about here > \n \nESTIMATION TECHNIQUE \nOne possible estimation technique for our dependent variables is the popular Cox (1972) \nproportional hazards model. It assumes that there is a time-variant underlying base hazard of \nabolition at any point of time that depends, possibly in a complex way, on unobserved variables \n(such as, for example, the influence of trans-national human rights advocacy networks). One of \n23 \nthe great advantages of the Cox model is that this baseline hazard does not need to be estimated. \nThe hazard rate in a given year is the probability of abolition of the death penalty in that year, \ncontingent on the country not having abolished in the previous year. Observed control variables \nincrease or lower this base hazard by a constant proportional amount. More formally, let \u03c1(t) be \nthe probability of abolition at time t; this is the hazard of abolition. Denoting \u03c10(t) the exogenous \nbaseline hazard, which reflects those time-dependent factors affecting \u03c1(t) that are common to \nall countries, the Cox proportional hazard model assumes that \n \n\u03c1(t) = \u03c10(t)exp(\u03b2Tx(t)),      (1) \n \nwhere x(t) is a vector of covariates shifting the baseline hazard, and \u03b2T is a vector of parameters \nto be estimated. A Maximum Likelihood estimation is carried out, where the likelihood function \nis constructed using the observation that the probability that country i achieves abolition at time ti \nequals \n\u2211\u2211\n\u2265\u2265\n==\nijij ttj\nij\nT\nii\nT\nttj\nij\nii\nii\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\n||\n))(exp(\n))(exp(\n)(\n)()(\u02c6\nx\u03b2\nx\u03b2\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03c1 .    (2) \n \nThe likelihood function to be maximized with respect to the vector \u03b2T is then simply \n\u220f\nit\nii t )(\u03c1\u02c6 . \nCountries become \u201cat risk\u201d of abolition at the start of our period or the year of their national \nindependence, if later. As a semi-parametric model, the Cox proportional hazards model depends \non less restrictive assumptions than the fully parametric competing exponential, Weibull, \nGamma, Gompertz or other models, which lead to more precise estimates only if the underlying \n24 \nprobability distribution assumes a particular corresponding form (Collett 1999). The Cox model \nencounters problems if many countries abolish the death penalty at the same time (Box-\nSteffensmeier and Jones 1997). Fortunately, in our data set there are not a great many ties in any \nyear. Another potential problem is that the underlying proportionality assumption might not hold \nfor the data at hand (Box-Steffensmeier and Zorn 2001). For that reason, we test the \nproportionality assumption and, fortunately, fail to reject it. \nRobust variance estimations are used and observations are assumed to be clustered, that is, \nare assumed to be independent only across countries, but are allowed to be correlated within \ncountries over time, which leads to less efficient, but more robust estimation. Since the same set \nof countries appear repeatedly over time in the sample and are therefore not likely to be \nindependent, a failure to take clustering into account can under-estimate standard errors. Results \nreported below are practically identical if we control for potential dependence of observations \nwith the help of a shared frailty model instead, which is the event history analysis equivalent of a \nrandom-effects panel data model. \n \nRESULTS \nTable 5 reports estimation results for the abolition of the death penalty for all crimes. The \nreported coefficients are hazard ratios, where a number above one means that the variable raises \nthe hazard of abolition, whereas the opposite is the case for a number below one. Tests for the \nunderlying proportional hazards assumption based on Schoenfeld residuals fail to reject the \nassumption at the 0.05 level for all regressions and at the 0.1 level in all regressions but model 3 \nof table 5. This suggests that the Cox estimator is appropriate to use for the data at hand. Model 1 \nreports results from a regression, in which democracy, regime transition, peace years, the dummy \n25 \nfor membership in the Council of Europe, the regional abolition share relative to the world mean, \nthe common law dummy, the Muslim population share and the measure of ethnic \nfractionalization are included. This model has the largest sample size since all other variables \nhave lower availability and are therefore added to this model only in further regressions. With \nthe exception of Peace years and Islam, which are statistically insignificant, all other variables \nare significant and in line with expectation. A greater extent of democracy, a regime transition \ntoward democracy, membership in the Council of Europe and a higher share of abolitionist \ncountries within the region relative to the world average all increase the likelihood of abolition, \nwhereas the opposite is true for a legal system based on English common law, and a higher \nextent of ethnic fractionalization. \n< Insert Table 5 about here > \nIn model 2 we add the (logged) per capita income level to the model. It is far from \nsignificant, however, and therefore not included in further model estimations. Despite the \nreduction in sample size, the other variables are hardly affected. The Muslim population share \nalmost becomes significant (p-value of 0.106). In model 3 we further add income inequality. \nNote that due to the poor availability of this variable the sample size drops substantially. We find \nthat higher income inequality has the expected negative effect on the likelihood of death penalty \nabolition, leaving all other variables mainly unaffected, with the exception of ethnic diversity, \nwhich becomes insignificant. Finally, in model 4 we add the homicide rate and the political \norientation of governments. Note that the period of study now becomes restricted to after 1975, \nresulting in a further substantial loss of observations. Democracy is no longer significant, but a \nregime transition toward democracy still raises the likelihood of death penalty abolition as does \nmembership in the Council of Europe and a higher share of abolitionist countries within the \n26 \nregion. A left-wing orientation of the chief executive\u2019s party raises, whereas a higher homicide \nrate lowers the likelihood of abolition. None of the other variables is statistically significant. \nTable 6 reports estimation results for abolition of the death penalty for ordinary crimes. The \nresults are rather similar to those reported in table 6 for the abolition of the death penalty for all \ncrimes. The major differences are twofold. First, greater ethnic fractionalization no longer lowers \nthe likelihood of death penalty abolition. Second, the lagged homicide rate and the Gini measure \nof income inequality are statistically insignificant. Otherwise the determinants of abolition are \nsimilar. Specifically, democracy, a regime transition toward democracy, membership in the \nCouncil of Europe, a higher share of abolitionist countries within the region as well as the left-\nwing orientation of the chief executive\u2019s party all raise the likelihood of abolition. A legal system \nbuilt on English common law and a predominantly Muslim population have the opposite effect in \nsome regressions with relatively large sample sizes. \n< Insert Table 6 about here > \nMany talk about American exceptionalism (e.g., Zimring and Hawkins 1986; Pennington \n2000; Zimring 2003) since with Japan it is the only democratic and developed country still \nholding on to the death penalty. Discussing possible reasons for this exceptionalism is beyond \nthe scope of this paper (see Steiker (2004) for an excellent overview). Unfortunately, for \nstatistical reasons it is not possible to include a dummy variable for the US into the estimations \nto see whether the retentionist status of the US can be explained sufficiently by the explanatory \nvariables, in which case the dummy variable would be insignificant, or whether there is \nsomething truly exceptional about the US, in which case the dummy variable would be \nstatistically significant. Loosely speaking this is because with the US being retentionist over the \nentire period, such a dummy variable would predict failure to abolish perfectly and therefore be \n27 \ndropped from the model. If we exclude the US, or the US and Japan together, from the \nestimations, then results are not much affected. This is not very surprising given that these \nrepresent just two out of a great many countries. If we include dummy variables for the regions \nof Western Europe as well as South America to account for the fact that countries from these \nregions were often frontrunners of abolition, then again our results are hardly affected. It is not \nsimple regionalism that drives abolition. \nIn other sensitivity analysis, we tried replacing the peace year variable with variables \nmeasuring the intensity of armed conflict. However, there was still hardly any evidence that \nactual experience of armed conflict matters for the abolition of the death penalty for all crimes. \nWe replaced Vanhanen\u2019s (1999) measure of ethnic fractionalization with two competing ones \ncreated by Alesina et al. (2003) and Fearon (2003) to see whether there is a more consistent \neffect apparent also on abolition of the death penalty for ordinary crimes. However, quite the \nopposite since these alternative measures never assume statistical significance in any of the \nestimations. One could argue that the monopoly state-ruling parties in a communist country are \nnot really left-wing in the traditional Western sense. If we restrict the Left-wing executive \nvariable to non-communist countries, then not surprisingly its coefficient size increases and its \nstandard error decreases. \nHow strong are the substantive effects of the explanatory variables on the hazard of death \npenalty abolition? Since variables are held in different units, it is not particularly enlightening to \ncompare the estimated hazard ratios directly. Table 7 reports the percentage changes in the \nhazard for those explanatory variables that are statistically significant at least at the 10 per cent \nlevel. For the continuous variables the changes are due to a one standard deviation increase in the \nvariable, whereas for the dummy variables the changes are due to a move from zero to one. \n28 \n< Insert Table 7 about here > \nFrom table 7, it is clear that the major political explanatory variables are not only \nstatistically significant, but also substantially strong predictors of the hazard of death penalty \nabolition. The left-wing orientation of the chief political executive and the Council of Europe \ndummy proxy variable for Western European pressure on Eastern European countries have \nparticularly strong substantive effects for abolition of both all and ordinary crimes only. The \npercentage change in hazards following one standard deviation increases in democracy, \ndemocratic transition and the share of abolitionists in the region are not quite so dramatic, but \nstill large. Strikingly, political factors are much more important substantively than social or \ncultural factors, with the economic factor (per capita income) never even being statistically \nsignificant. The only exception is perhaps the homicide rate, for which the estimated reduction in \nthe hazard of death penalty abolition for all crimes following a one standard deviation increase is \nquite strong. \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis article has demonstrated that political factors are major drivers of the apparent global trend \ntoward abolition of the death penalty. Democracy and the transition to democracy are important. \nThis suggests that in democracies in general, and in newly established democracies in particular, \nthere is a growing acceptance to regard the death penalty as a violation of human rights, which \nrenders abolition more likely. This result, which derives from estimation of the process of death \npenalty abolition over the time period 1950 to 2001, is in accordance with results from the purely \ncross-sectional discriminant analysis of Neapolitan (2001) and the regression analysis of \nGreenberg and West (2003). In addition to democracy and democratization, political pressure on \n29 \nretentionist countries has a positive impact on the likelihood of abolition. Another result is \nparticularly interesting: Even after controlling for domestic determinants, a higher share of \nabolitionist countries within the region raises the likelihood of abolition in remaining retentionist \ncountries suggesting that regional contagion dynamics play a role. This suggests that the global \ntrend toward abolition might partly feed itself as an increasing share of countries become \nabolitionist. We also find evidence for a partisan effect with abolition being more likely if the \nchief executive\u2019s party is left-wing oriented. This confirms studies of the existence and \napplication of the death penalty in US states, which also demonstrate partisan effects together \nwith the important role of public ideologies (Jacobs and Carmichael 2002, 2004). In comparison, \nno evidence is found that historical experience of armed conflicts has an effect on the abolition \nof the death penalty for all crimes. This result is in line with Dun\u00e9r and Geurtsen\u2019s (2002) \nqualitative observation that war experience has not prevented countries from joining \ninternational treaties outlawing the death penalty. They fear, however, that war experience might \nstill be relevant and might represent an obstacle to the global abolition of the death penalty. Our \nmultivariate quantitative analysis suggests that such experience is not likely to impose a barrier \non abolition. \nIn terms of future research, it would be worthwhile studying in more detail why countries \nsometimes choose to abolish the death penalty for ordinary crimes, but not for all crimes. Our \nresults suggest that the major determinants are rather similar across the two types of death \npenalty abolition. However, more research is needed to explain why a greater extent of ethnic \nfractionalization lowers the likelihood of abolition for all crimes, but not for ordinary crimes. \nSimilarly, it is rather surprising that a higher lagged homicide rate lowers the likelihood of \nabolition for all crimes, but not for ordinary crimes, given that homicide is an ordinary crime. \n30 \nWe would like to tackle these and related questions in the future. This article has explored new \nground, but much still needs to be studied in more detail. Our quantitative cross-national time-\nseries study can also not explain why the United States and Japan remain the only retentionist \ndeveloped country democracies. Only a detailed analysis of the social and political histories of \nboth countries can provide such an explanation, which would be beyond the scope of this article, \nhowever. More generally, only qualitative studies can explore in detail the processes and \nmechanisms leading to abolition and their relative importance in different country contexts. \nCan the worldwide trend towards abolition of the death penalty be expected to continue? \nOur results suggest that if democracy spreads further around the world then indeed the trend can \ncontinue. Democratization thus represents one of the greatest promises to the abolitionist camp. \nIf the spread of democracy around the world becomes stalled, then the trend towards death \npenalty abolition is likely to slow down or even become itself stalled as well. Furthermore, \nabolitionist countries can exert pressure on retentionist countries to change camps if they have \nsomething interesting and valuable to offer in return. This follows from the effect that \nmembership in the Council of Europe exerts on death penalty abolition. Western European \ncountries might have applied the pressure on prospective Eastern European members to comply \nwith the requirement of abolition rather unevenly, as Fawn (2001) argues. Also, the application \nand accession to the Council of Europe went hand in hand with the democratization of Eastern \nEuropean countries. But the incentive to join the Council of Europe, often regarded as a first step \ntowards eventual membership of the European Union, seems to have been an additional and \nimportant determinant for the abolition of the death penalty. This follows from the fact that our \ndummy variable for Council of Europe membership, admittedly a crude measure for the political \npressure exerted by Western European countries, is significant throughout even though \n31 \ndemocracy and democratic transition are also controlled for. It remains to be seen whether \nEurope can exert similar pressure on Sub-Saharan African or Asian countries with aid or trade \nincentives. It is highly unlikely that it will manage to pressure the US into abolition, but personal \nlinks between the political, economic and social elites on both sides of the Atlantic might have a \ngreater effect (Zimring 2003). One thing is clear: Many retentionists around the world point \ntoward the US in defending their position against human rights campaigners and the US retains \nstrong influence on many countries. If the most powerful Western country converted into the \nabolitionist camp this would put a whole new momentum into the global abolitionist campaign. \nNoteworthy, no evidence is found that the level of economic development impacts upon \ndeath penalty abolition. Controlling for the variables in our model, death penalty abolition does \nnot seem to be a normal good. This confirms more casual evidence that the death penalty is also \npresent in rich countries such as the US, Japan, Singapore and some of the Gulf countries and is \nabsent in many poor countries. Abolitionists can therefore not hope that as per capita incomes \ngrow the death penalty will go. On the other hand, a country\u2019s poverty clearly is no obstacle to \ndeath penalty abolition. \nSome other factors could impose some barrier towards the eventual abolition of the death \npenalty in all countries since they are not likely to change much over time. Common law \ncountries are less likely to abolish the death penalty in some regressions. The same is true in a \nfew regressions for ethnically more fractionalized and countries with a high degree of inequality \nand a high rate of violent crime in the case of abolition for all crimes (results again consistent \nwith some of the evidence reported by Jacobs and Carmichael (2002, 2004) on the use and \napplication of the death penalty in US states). The same applies to countries with a \npredominantly Muslim population in the case of abolition for ordinary crimes only. Overall, \n32 \nhowever, whether or not the trend toward global abolition of the death penalty will continue is \nmainly determined by political factors that can be influenced. A good case in point is that whilst \nthe vast majority of Muslim countries are retentionist, the Islam variable is rarely significant in \nour regressions conditional on the other variables included. What this suggests is that the lack of \ndemocracy, the lack of political incentives and the fact that most Muslim countries are located in \nregions with very few abolitionist countries are more important explanations than Islam itself. \nInterestingly, Turkey, one of the few Muslim countries to have abolished the death penalty, did \nso in order to boost its chances for EU membership and during a period of more general \ndemocratization. Abolitionists must therefore encourage democratization, political pressure on \nretentionist countries, cross-country spillover effects rendering entire regions increasingly \nabolitionist as well as political leadership by governments, of which those with a left-wing \norientation seem to be more inclined towards achieving abolition. They must not be discouraged \nby seemingly unchangeable cultural and social factors. These do play a role, but abolition is \nforemost determined by political factors. \n33 \nREFERENCES \nAlesina, Alberto, Arnaud Devleeschauwer, William Easterly, Sergio Kurlat, and Romain Wacziarg. \n2003.
