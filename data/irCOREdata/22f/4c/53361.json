A high-\nresolution airborne geophysical radiometric survey of Northern Ireland has provided\nan opportunity to study the distribution and possible redistribution of 137Cs.\nThe 137Cs activity (recorded at 1.2 million points) is distributed in a series of\nbands oriented approximately 160\u2218 and 115\u2218 clockwise from north. Geostatistical anal-\nysis of the data shows a strong, short-range structure (correlation ranges between 0.6\nand 8 km) in 137Cs activity across the vast majority of the region; the spatial distribu-\ntion shows association with a published, coarse-scale depositional pattern of 137Cs from\nChernobyl. Two indices of land form derived from a digital elevation model, namely\ncompound topographic index and the length\u2013slope factor of the Revised Universal Soil\nLoss Equation, account for only 3% of the variance in 137Cs activity. In contrast, soil\ntype and land cover in combination (including their interaction) account for 20% of\nthe variance. In areas that received moderate fallout from Chernobyl, soil type alone\naccounts for a substantial proportion of the spatially correlated 137Cs activity. We\nattribute this to each soil type\u2019s having a fairly uniform radiocaesium interception po-\ntential that differs from those of other soil types and that this potential controls the\nvertical migration of 137Cs. Over the granitic Mourne Mountains there is a strong spa-\ntial cross-correlation between 137Cs activity and airborne estimates of soil potassium,\nsuggesting that the latter provides a measure of the soil\u2019s radiocaesium interception\npotential; this is probably dominated by the quantity of the mineral illite.\nKEYWORDS: caesium-137; soil; Northern Ireland; Chernobyl; geostatistics; wet de-\nposition.\n2\nIntroduction\nIn northern Europe the soil contains caesium-137 (137Cs) primarily from two sources:\ncaesium released from the testing of atomic weapons largely between 1952 and 1962\n(Carter and Moghissi, 1977) and fallout following the nuclear accident at Chernobyl\non 26 April 1986 (ApSimon et al., 1989). The range of cumulative ground deposition\nof 137Cs from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing between 1945 and 1985 over the\nnorthern hemisphere has been estimated to range from 0 to 9.38 kBq m\u22122 (Wright\net al., 1999; decay corrected to 1985). In some regions deposition from Chernobyl\nfar outweighs that from atmospheric weapons testing; Golosov (2002) cites moderate\nactivities of 137Cs deposition across northern Europe from the Chernobyl accident of\nup to 40 kBq m\u22122.\nThe spatial distribution of 137Cs is of much interest because it can tell us where\ngamma radiation might present a significant hazard through consumption of contam-\ninated food. The spatial pattern of 137Cs many years after deposition can also tell us\nabout redistribution of the radionuclide as a result of soil erosion, differential migration\nthrough the soil\u2014or its complement, differential retention in the soil.\nThere have been few published reports of the detailed spatial distribution of 137Cs\nfrom Chernobyl over large areas (De Cort et al., 1998). Regional and national sets of\ndata include those over central Russia (Izrael, 1993) and Austria (Bossew et al., 2001),\nboth showing the widespread fallout from Chernobyl superimposed on that from the\nearlier weapons testing.\nMore recently, in 2005 and 2006, an airborne geophysical survey of the whole of\nNorthern Ireland provided high-resolution estimates of 137Cs for the 13 500 km2 of the\nregion. Approximately 20 years after the Chernobyl accident, this unique set of data\nprovides a \u2018snapshot\u2019 representing the original fallout from Chernobyl superimposed\non the background activity of radiocaesium from weapons testing, plus the effects of\nsubsequent redistribution. This information can aid our understanding of the soil prop-\nerties and processes controlling the retention and redistribution of 137Cs over the land.\n3\nIt might also be possible to identify covariates that control the retention or migration\nof 137Cs in the soil and so improve our understanding of the processes determining the\nredistribution of 137Cs across the landscape.\nWe need to consider three main factors when we try to understand the present-\nday spatial distribution of 137Cs over northern Europe. First, as van Berghe and Gulink\n(1987) have shown, the deposition of 137Cs from atmospheric weapons testing is pro-\nportional to the amount of precipitation. Deposition of 137Cs is dominated by wet\ndeposition, and it is likely to have been fairly uniform at any one place as a result of\nthe longer-term averaging effects of annual rainfall. Second, the superimposed pattern\nof deposition from Chernobyl would have been determined largely by the pattern of\nrainfall in the few days following the accident. Unfortunately, the rainfall at the time\nwas measured at too few sites to establish a pattern that might have accounted for vari-\nation in the associated activities of 137Cs at the local scale. Ground-based observations\naround the Sellafield nuclear plant in northern England showed that there was con-\nsiderable local variation in the deposition of 137Cs (Jackson et al., 1987). Third, a set\nof inter-related landscape features, including soil type, local geomorphology and land\nuse control the interception, retention or migration of the deposited caesium, either\nvertically through the soil or laterally across the landscape.\nPerhaps the most important soil property is the soil\u2019s radiocaesium interception\npotential (frequently abbreviated to RIP); this depends largely on the quantity and\ntype of clay minerals (Sweek et al., 1990). Gil-Garc\u00b4\u0131a et al. (2009) compiled data\non the distribution coefficients for the adsorption of radiocaesium determined in both\nthe field and the laboratory, and showed that geometric mean partition coefficients\n(in litres per kg) increased in the following order according to soil type (larger values\nrepresent greater adsorption): organic (270), sand (530), loam (3500) and clay (5500).\nSo variation in the clay content of the soil, and hence its adsorption capacity, is likely to\nhave led to differences in vertical migration of 137Cs through the soil and consequently\nto differences in the activity of the radionuclide observed in our study region, Northern\n4\nIreland. According to Kirchner and Baumgartner (1992), 137Cs from Chernobyl is likely\nto have reached sorption equilibrium with the soil within 3 years because of the small\nhydration energy of the Cs+ ion. In soils with large quantities of organic matter and\nfew micaceous specific sorption sites, radiocaesium seems likely to be held mainly on\nion exchange sites from which it is readily and reversibly exchangeable and available to\nplants. This has significance for Northern Ireland where approximately 14.7% of the\ntotal area is covered by peat (Cruickshank, 1997).\nLand use influences the magnitude of wet deposition reaching the soil through\ninterception by vegetation (Kinnersley et al., 1997). On agricultural land tillage ex-\nposes bare soil, which is then at risk to erosion and redistribution of any radiocaesium\nit contains. The effect of redistribution on 137Cs can be substantially greater in some\nenvironments than that from differential adsorption, and it is the basis for the estima-\ntion of soil erosion in which the radionuclide is used as a tracer (Zapata, 2002). Land\nform also affects the transport of radiocaesium; Tyler and Heal (2000) showed that for\norganic upland soil, the compound topographic index (the CTI) accounted for a large\nproportion of the spatial variation in 137Cs in a small upland catchment.\nOur preliminary analysis of the spatial distribution of 137Cs from the airborne sur-\nvey of Northern Ireland suggested that much of the variation is of short range (between\n<0.6 and 8 km). Other studies have also suggested that deposition of radiocaesium can\nvary substantially over short distances. For example, Albers et al. (1998) published\nthe results of surveys of two 100-m transects in alpine pastures along which there was\nmuch variation in radiocaesium activity. Data compiled from observations of activities\nof 137Cs in the soil at 750 sample sites in Cumbria in northern England between 1986\nand 1999 showed that 75% of the spatial variation was unresolved at distances less than\n350 m (Wright et al., 2002). Also, the initial pattern of radiocaesium deposition was\nidentified as a factor in its short-range variation across a small catchment in Slovakia\n(van der Perk et al., 2002).\nThe current spatial pattern of 137Cs has thus been determined by variation in\n5\n(i) the fallout, (ii) the retention in the soil by adsorption and (iii) by redistribution\nover the land surface by erosion. Analyses of rainfall patterns over the United Kingdom\nsoon after the Chernobyl accident suggested that quantities of 137Cs similar to those\nrecorded in northern England were deposited over Northern Ireland (Clark and Smith,\n1988). In a more detailed report, the same authors (Smith and Clark, 1989) stated\nthat radar data\u2014which can be used to estimate patterns and intensities of rainfall\naccurately\u2014were not available for Northern Ireland in 1986. As there were no radar\ndata, Smith and Clark used measurements from 181 rain gauges and the timing and\nmovement of the Chernobyl plume to estimate the amounts of rain that fell over the\nregion having intercepted it (Figure 1).\nInitially the amount of 137Cs from Chernobyl would have been independent of\nvariation in soil properties, except insofar as the soil is related to altitude and rainfall;\ntypically the higher the land and the more rain received, the greater would have been\nthe deposition of 137Cs. The soil map shows, however, that there is a wide variety of soil\ntypes in Northern Ireland, and we know that soil properties control to a large degree\nthe retention or loss of caesium. We therefore expect the spatial distribution of 137Cs\nto be related to the soil pattern evident on the soil map. We might also expect the\nspatial distribution of 137Cs to reflect areas of soil accumulation and loss resulting from\nerosion. One can investigate this by calculating the spatial variation in topographic\nindices (e.g. slope angle and length or flow accumulation) derived from digital elevation\nmodels and making statistical comparisons with the patterns of 137Cs.\nThe airborne survey geophysical survey of Northern Ireland, in which the activ-\nities of 137Cs and three naturally occuring radionuclides were determined across the\nentire landscape, provides an opportunity to explore the relative importance of the\nfactors which have contributed to its spatial distribution. We analysed these data geo-\nstatistically both over the region as a whole and locally. We assess the degree to which\nthe depositional pattern of 137Cs from Chernobyl as estimated by Clark and Smith\n(1988) can be identified from the airborne survey. We assess the relative importance\n6\nof five landscape factors (land cover, soil properties, erosive potential and topographic\naccumulation) in controlling the retention or migration of 137Cs across all of North-\nern Ireland and where fallout was greatest. We then focus on the Mourne Mountains\nwhere the distribution of 137Cs has a particularly short-range pattern. We show that\npotassium in the soil, also estimated from the airborne survey, is coregionalized with\n137Cs for this smaller region. We also discuss the wider implications of our findings.\nBackground to the study area\nSoils, land-use and topography\nThe soils of Northern Ireland have been described by Cruickshank (1997). They com-\nprise poorly-drained gley soils (54%), peat and rankers (24%) and freely drained soils\n(16%) - see Figure 2. Digital versions of soil maps at 1:50 000 were available for all of\nNorthern Ireland with 19 unique codes, one for each major soil group (Cruickshank,\n1997). Grassland is the dominant land use in Northern Ireland (72%), with a smaller\nproportion of rough grazing (18%); only 6% of the land is cultivated, 1% is woodland\nand the other 3% consists of a range of other land use types. To help assess the degree\nof association between land use and the distribution of 137Cs we extracted digital poly-\ngons of land cover from the CORINE data of 2000 (Nunes de Lima, 2005) for Northern\nIreland (1:100 000 scale). Thirty five types of land cover were recorded. A brief analy-\nsis of ten, historical 1:63 600 scale maps (Government of Northern Ireland, 1947\u20131951)\npublished following the land utilization survey of Northern Ireland (1938\u20131939) shows\nthe only significant change is a decline in the proportion of arable land since the second\nworld war; at that time more land area was cultivated. The Land Cover Map of 2000\nshows that most of this arable land has since been converted to pasture; this change\nis likely to have been before the accident at Chernobyl. The impact of this change on\nthe migration of 137Cs deposited from Chernobyl is likely to have been small.\nNorthern Ireland has a varied topography, with 75% of the land area below 150 m\nelevation\u2014mostly around Lough Neagh\u2014and only 6% above 300 m. There are four\nmain upland areas; the Tertiary basalt plateau, the Sperrin Mountains, the granitic\n7\nMourne Mountains, and finally the plateau area to the west of Lough Erne (Figure 3).\nWe obtained a digital elevation model covering all of Northern Ireland, accurate to\n1 m on a 50-m grid (photogrammetrically derived by the Ordnance Survey of Northern\nIreland r\u20dd).\n137Cs deposition\nMcAulay and Moran (1989) assessed the fallout of 137Cs over the Republic of Ireland\nand Northern Ireland both from Chernobyl and weapons testing. They measured the\nactivities of 137Cs and 134Cs at 110 sites in August 1986 and calculated the residual\ncomponent of 137Cs from weapon tests after subtracting the 137Cs from Chernobyl,\nwhich they calculated from the known ratio of the two isotopes released from the\naccident. Using the standard radioactive decay equation, and the half-life of 137Cs\n(30.17 years), we calculated from their results the activity of 137Cs from weapon tests\nremaining when the airborne geophysical survey of Northern Ireland was flown. This\ngave a 137Cs mean of 0.5 kBq m\u22122 to a depth of 30 cm from weapon tests, though\nthe activity ranged up to 3.4 kBq m\u22122 on some shallow upland soils, which McAulay\nand Moran attributed to the larger, local average annual rainfall. With respect to\nthe deposition of 137Cs from Chernobyl, Smith and Clark (1989) stated , \u2018. . . the\nconvective rainfall and deposition shows a banded structure . . . much of the rainfall\nfrom deep convective storms . . . with narrow footprints elongated alongwind, with\nsimilar footprints of activity-deposition\u2019. They produced a choropleth map based on\nestimated rainfall that intercepted the radioactive plume for the period 2\u20134 of May\n1986, following the Chernobyl accident (see Figure 1). It shows that the land receiving\nthe most rain (>10 mm) occurred in two bands (oriented approximately 115\u2218 clockwise\nfrom north) in the north and central-south of the region. Although some of the uplands\nreceive more rain in total than lowland areas, the broad patterns over this two day\nperiod are not closely related to altitude.\nMethods\n8\nAirborne geophysical survey\nThe Tellus airborne geophysical survey of Northern Ireland, flown in 2005 and 2006,\ncomprised more than 82 000 km of flight lines. High-resolution radiometric data were\nacquired with an Exploranium GR820 256-channel NaI(Tl) gamma spectrometer sys-\ntem of four downward (32 litres) and one upward-looking (8 litres) crystal sets. Data\nfrom the sensor were recorded every second corresponding to approximately 60-m in-\ntervals in the direction of flight. Survey lines were spaced 200 m apart with flight lines\noriented at 345\u2218 and 165\u2218. Perpendicular tie-lines 2000 m apart were flown in the early\nstages of the survey, covering only the western portion of the region. The aircraft flew\n56 m above ground in rural areas, but higher (244 m) above elevated structures and\nurban areas. The ground area or \u2018footprint\u2019, from which most of the radiation recorded\ncomes, has the form of an ellipse elongated in the direction of flight. For example, at\n56 m above the ground 75% of the measured radiation comes from an ellipse with a\nlong diameter of 220 m in the flight direction and perpendicular diameter of 150 m\n(Pitkin and Duval, 1980). A complete description of the airborne geophysical systems\ndeployed and the processing methods used is given by Hautaniemi et al. (2005). Pro-\ncedures for processing the airborne radiometric data were based on those described in\nthe reference manuals of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA, 1991) and\nthe Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO; Grasty and Minty, 1995). The\nprocessing included corrections for aircraft and cosmic background radiation, altitude\nof the aircraft and spectral interactions. Gamma radiation measured by the airborne\nsystem comes from a thin surface layer of about 30 cm in rock, rather more in less\ndense unconsolidated material such as mineral soil, to a maximum of a few metres in\ndry peat.\nThe corrected count rates were used to estimate the concentration of three natural\nradioelements within the conventional energy ranges: K (1.37\u20131.57 MeV), equivalent U\n(eU, derived from 214Bi, 1.66\u20131.86 MeV) and equivalent Th (eTh, derived from 208Tl,\n2.41\u20132.81 MeV) (IAEA, 1991). In addition, the activities of the anthropogenic radionu-\n9\nclide 137Cs were determined from the same spectra. The survey yielded ca 1.2 million\nvalues for K(%), eTh (mg kg\u22121) and eU (mg kg\u22121) and activities of 137Cs (kBq m\u22122.\nEstimated activities of 137Cs were based on a full spectrum, least-squares fitting proce-\ndure (Minty, 1998) in the Praga\ud447\ud440 extension to the Oasis montaj\ud447\ud440 software package\n(Geosoft Inc). Calibration was carried out to take account of the possible interference\ncaused by the close proximity of the 609 KeV 214Bi energy line to 137Cs (662 KeV); ex-\nploratory data analysis suggested that this interference may introduce a small amount\nof bias.\nA comparison between ground-based and airborne measurements of the activities\nof 137Cs was undertaken at a series of ground reference locations to ensure the latter\nwere of reasonable accuracy and to assess the degree and variation in the extent of\nvertical migration of 137Cs. Estimation of the activities of 137Cs from both ground-\nbased and airborne detectors rely on assumptions concerning the depth distribution\nof 137Cs \u2014 the assumption of exponential decrease with depth soon after deposition\nbecomes less accurate over time as 137Cs migrates vertically through the soil. The\nfluence rate of photons at the land surface from a gamma source is related to its vertical\ndistribution in the soil which is incorporated in calculations of integrated activity per\nunit area, A\ud44e (Bq cm\n\u22122) by the mean mass depth (\ud6fd):\nA\ud44e = \ud6fdA\ud45a,0 , (1)\nwhere A\ud45a,0 is activity per unit mass at the surface of the soil (Bq g\n\u22121).\nAlong four transects (total length 40 km) with varying soil properties, 80 separate\nin situ gamma spectrometry measurements were undertaken using a Ge detector. At\none site along each transect, five soil cores (0 to 40 cm depth) were collected for\nlaboratory-based measurement of the activities of 137Cs at 5-cm incremental depths.\nDistributions of activities of 137Cs down the soil cores were varied; at one site\nthere was an exponential decline in activity of 137Cs with depth, whilst at others there\nwere subsurface maxima. The ground-based measurements were processed assuming a\nmean mass depth (\ud6fd) of 10 g cm\u22122. Following the guidance for the processing airborne\n10\nsurvey data (IAEA, 1993), we assumed 137Cs declined exponentially with depth; a mean\nmass depth (\ud6fd) value of 1 g cm\u22122 was applied to all the airborne survey data, Equation\n( ??). The influence of depth distribution is smaller for airborne survey because at\naltitudes of 60 m the solid angle is much smaller than at 1 m \u2013 a typical measurement\nheight for ground-based detectors (ICRU, 1994; Tyler, 2007).\nA comparison between the ground-based and airborne measurements for all ref-\nerence locations is shown in Figure 4. Despite the large differences between the scales\nof measurements for these two methods, there is a strong linear relationship between\nthe estimated activities of 137Cs for the reference sites (linear correlation coefficient\n\ud45f = 0.79). The airborne measurements of the activities of 137Cs are generally smaller\nthan the ground-based measurements. These differences may be accounted for by the\nsmaller mean mass depth (\ud6fd) used in the former. A larger mean mass depth indicates\ngreater attenuation of the gamma-ray signal by the overlying soil, resulting in larger\nestimates of the activities of 137Cs.\nAt the scale of airborne survey it is not possible to adjust \ud6fd during data processing\nto account for the short-range variation in depth distributions of the activities of 137Cs.\nTherefore, our airborne survey provides estimates of the activities of 137Cs based on\ntheir spatial variation and an assumption concerning vertical migration. Selecting a\nlarger, constant mean mass depth (\ud6fd) would alter the magnitude of the estimated\nactivities of 137Cs, but not the differences between them. However, the proportion of\nvariation in estimated 137Cs activities attributable to the different soil and land use\ntypes may be overestimated by assuming a constant mean mass depth over all sites.\nThis is because at those sites where 137Cs subsurface maxima occur deeper than a few\ncentimetres attenuation of the gamma-ray signal by overlying soil will be greater than\nthat assumed by our model, leading to an underestimate of the activities of 137Cs. This\nwill exaggerate the differences in the estimates of 137Cs activities at these sites when\ncompared with those with surface maxima (1-2 cm) of 137Cs.\nLandscape factors\n11\nWe calculated the length\u2013slope (LS) factor in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation\n(RUSLE) as a standard, dimensionless estimate of the amount of soil likely to be lost\nby erosion. Its formula is\nLS =\n(\n\ud706\n22.3\n)\ud45a\n\u00d7 \ud446 , (2)\nwhere \ud706 is the flow path length (in metres) and \ud45a is the ratio of rill-to-interill erosion.\nThe quantity \ud446 depends on the slope, \ud6fd, as follows.\n\ud446 = 10.8 sin \ud6fd + 0.03 for tan \ud6fd < 0.09\n\ud446 = 16.8 sin \ud6fd \u2212 0.5 for tan \ud6fd \u2265 0.09 .\nWe made the calculations for a 50-m grid using the digital elevation model (DEM)\nand an ArcInfoTM script, as described by Van Remortel et al. (2001). We used the\nDEM to calculate compound topographic index (CTI as defined by Quinn et al., 1991)\non the 50-m grid using the D-infinity algorithm of Tarboton (1997):\nCTI = ln\n(\n\ud434\ntan \ud6fd\n)\n, (3)\nwhere \ud434 is the specific catchment area and \ud6fd is the slope angle, here locally. We used\na GIS spatial join procedure to associate each airborne radiometric survey point with\na digital soil polygon and its associated soil feature code, a CORINE code for class\nof land cover, a rainfall polygon (Figure 1), a length\u2013slope factor value, a CTI value\nand its altitude (metres above mean sea level). To assess the importance of five of the\nlandscape factors (CTI, length\u2013slope, soil type, altitude and land cover) on the spatial\ndistribution of 137Cs across all of Northern Ireland, we selected a random subset of\n50 000 of the survey points.\nStatistical analysis\nTable 1 summarizes the statistics of activities of 137Cs for the whole region and for each\nof the rainfall classes in Figure 1. Histograms of the data showed that for each rainfall\nclass and for the entire survey area the distributions were approximately normal, and\n12\nthis inference accords with the skewness coefficients between \u22120.14 and 0.15 listed in\nTable 1. We interpolated values from all of the data on to a fine grid and created a\ncontinuous colour map of activities of 137Cs for the region (Figure 3).\nWe also wished to explore the spatial variation for the individual rainfall classes\nshown on this map. To assess the spatial structure of activities of 137Cs for each\nrainfall class we first examined the data for trend across the entire survey region and\nfound none. We then computed variograms from the data using Matheron\u2019s standard\nestimator to a maximum lag of 20 km:\n\ud6fe\u02c6\ud462\ud463(h) =\n1\n2\ud45a(h)\n\ud45a(h)\u2211\n\ud457=1\n{\ud467\ud462(x\ud457)\u2212 \ud467\ud462(x\ud457 + h)} {\ud467\ud463(x\ud457)\u2212 \ud467\ud463(x\ud457 + h)} . (4)\nHere \ud467\ud462(x\ud457) and \ud467\ud462(x\ud457 + h) and \ud467\ud463(x\ud457) and \ud467\ud463(x\ud457 + h) are the observed values of any\ntwo variables \ud462 and \ud463 at positions x\ud457 and x\ud457 + h separated by the lag vector h, and\n\ud45a(h) is the number of paired comparisons at that lag. If \ud462 = \ud463 then we obtain the\nauto-variogram for variable \ud462; if not then we obtain the cross-variogram for \ud462 and \ud463.\nThere was no evidence for anisotropy, so we treated the lag as a scalar in distance only,\ni.e. \u210e = \u2223h\u2223, and fitted isotropic functions to model the experimental auto-variograms\nby weighted least-squares.\nThe next stage of our analysis was to determine the separate and combined effects\nof two factors (land cover and soil type) on activities of 137Cs. For this we first did\na one-way analysis of variance (anova) on each factor independently. We then did a\ntwo-factor analysis, but as the classes contain disparate numbers of observations we had\nto use residual maximum likelihood (reml, Patterson and Thompson, 1971) for the\npurpose. This involved adding the factors sequentially, and because the two factors are\nconfounded the estimates of their effects depend on the order in which they are added\nin the model. We therefore did two analyses, one with land cover entered first and the\nother with soil type added first. The interaction is unaffected by the order of entry\ninto the model. We selected the 40% of survey points with length\u2013slope values greater\nthan the minimum; these values were positively skewed (skewness coefficient=2.22)\nand so we took natural logarithms to stabilize the variances (skewness=0.01). The\n13\ndistribution of CTI values was less (but still positively) skewed, so we transformed\nCTI to their square roots. Finally, we calculated the multiple linear regression of 137Cs\non the transformed LS and CTI by least squares.\nIn addition to our analyses of activities of 137Cs covering the entire region de-\nscribed above, we undertook two sets of more local analyses. The first concerned the\narea estimated to have received between 15 and 20 mm of rain from during the three\ndays of 2, 3 and 4 May 1986 following the Chernobyl accident (1840 km2; Figure 1).\nWe selected this region because it had the largest median activities of 137Cs (Table 1);\nthe signal-to-noise ratio is greater here than elsewhere, so the effect of measurement\nerror on comparisons between these data is minimal. We examined in greater detail\nhow the landscape factors relate to the spatial distribution of activities of 137Cs. We\nexpanded the regression model above to include the soil type, land cover and altitude\nin addition to LS and CTI. We then computed variograms of the residuals from the\nmodels to a maximum lag of 20 km. To these we fitted optimum authorized models as\nabove using GenStat, and the results are shown in Figure 5.\nIn the event we found that double exponential models with nugget components\nfitted best in most instances. Their formula is\n\ud6fe(\u210e) = \ud4500 + \ud4501\n{\nexp\u2212\n(\n\u210e\n\ud44e1\n)}\n+ \ud4502\n{\nexp\u2212\n(\n\u210e\n\ud44e2\n)}\nfor \u210e > 0\n= 0 for \u210e = 0 , (5)\nin which \ud4500 is the nugget variance, \ud4501 and \ud4502 are the sill variances of the short-range\nand longer-range components respectively, and \ud44e1 and \ud44e2 are the corresponding distance\nparameters and equal approximately to 0.33\u00d7 the effective ranges of those components.\nThe distance parameter \ud44e1 varied between 0.2 and 3 km, and \ud44e2 from 3 to 55 km.\nThe second set of local analyses were of those observations over the Mourne\nMountains only; note that activities of 137Cs exhibit a larger proportion of short-range\nvariation in this part of the region (see Figure 3). Assuming the initial deposition was\nnot entirely responsible for this local variation, we considered that further analysis of\nthe distribution of 137Cs might help us to understand the processes controlling its mi-\n14\ngration better. The Mourne Mountains are composed entirely of granite which weathers\nto clay, including the mineral illite (McAlister et al., 1997) which could account for\nmuch of the variation in the RIP of the soil. For them we computed auto-variograms\nof activities of 137Cs and estimates of K (%) content and their cross-variogram to a\nlag of 4 km at intervals of 100 m. To these we fitted an isotropic linear model of\ncoregionalization:\n\ud6fe\ud462\ud463(\u210e) =\n\ud43e\u2211\n\ud458=1\n\ud44f\ud458\ud462\ud463\ud454\ud458(\u210e) , (6)\nin which the \ud454\ud458, \ud458 = 1, 2, . . . , \ud43e, are basic variogram functions with a priori variances\nof 1 and specific distance parameters, and the coefficients \ud44f\ud458\ud462\ud463 are the sill variances of\nsecond-order stationary processes.\nFrom the fitted models we also calculated the structural correlation coefficients\nto aid our understanding of the changes in correlation with changes in spatial scale.\nThese coefficients, \ud70c\ud458, are analogous to the familiar Pearson correlation coefficient,\nbut each is specific to the component of variation represented by the basic variogram\nfunction, \ud454\ud458(\u210e), and so is specific to a particular spatial scale of variation (Goovaerts\nand Webster, 1994). They are estimated from the sill variances by\n\ud70c\u02c6 \ud458\ud462\ud463 =\n\ud44f\ud458\ud462\ud463\u221a\n\ud44f\ud458\ud462\ud462\ud44f\n\ud458\n\ud463\ud463\n. (7)\nResults and interpretation\nRainfall and 137Cs distribution\nThe median activities of 137Cs increase with increasing estimates of rainfall intercepted\nby the plume (Table 1), although the two largest classes have similar values. However,\nFigure 3, the map of activities of 137Cs, shows much greater complexity than that of\nthe rainfall polygons in Figure 1. The former displays three sets of linear bands of\ngreater (>3.5 kBq m\u22122) 137Cs activities oriented approximately 160\u2218 clockwise from\nnorth and another series of smaller bands oriented approximately 115\u2218 clockwise from\nnorth, to the south and west of Lough Neagh. The auto-variograms for the individual\n15\nclasses of rainfall revealed the largest proportion of spatially correlated variance where\nestimated intercepted rainfall was greatest after the Chernobyl accident (Figure 6). As\nabove, the auto-variogram models comprise three components: a nugget plus two nested\nexponential components (Table 2). In this study we believe the nugget component of\napproximately 0.55 (kBq m\u22122)2 to be dominated by measurement error; there is almost\nno nugget in the cross-variogram of 137Cs and potassium in the Mourne Mountains (see\nbelow and Figure 7 and Table 5).\nFor each auto-variogram, the first exponential component accounts for a large\nproportion of the spatially correlated variance at distances <3 km; this component is\nespecially marked in the 10\u201315 mm rainfall class (Figure 5). We attribute this structure\nto the combination of two factors; the depositional pattern of fallout and the factors\ncontrolling the subsequent migration of the 137Cs, but we cannot separate their relative\nimportance.\nLandscape factors\nIn combination, the CTI and length\u2013slope factors accounted for only 3% of the variance\nin activities of 137Cs (coefficient of determination \ud4452 = 0.03) across all of Northern\nIreland. This suggests that transport of 137Cs by erosion\u2014at the national scale\u2014was\nnot a major factor controlling its redistribution since deposition. This is probably\nbecause of the dominance of permanent grass, which virtually prevents erosion; the\nvertical redistribution of soil particles to which 137Cs is adsorbed, predominates. Soil\ntype and land cover class accounted for significant proportions of the variance: 14.9 and\n15.7%, respectively (calculated from the sum of squares for each factor as a proportion\nof the total sum of squares; Table 3). In combination (including their significant\ninteraction) they accounted for 19.6% of the variance: the residual variance is 0.7880\nout of the total of 0.9796 (Table 4). Note that because the factors are confounded the\nvalues in Table 4 depend strongly on the order in which they are entered in the model\nfor the analysis.\nDifferences in the rates at which 137Cs moves from soil to plants (Gastberger\n16\net al., 2000), the fixation of radiocaesium in the biomass and cycling between living\nand dead parts of the vegetation can explain why land cover accounts for so much of\nthe variation in activities of 137Cs. The substantial confounding effect between soil\ntype and land cover occurs because particular ecosystems have developed\u2014and land is\nmanaged\u2014on certain soil types.\nAreas receiving 15\u201320 mm of plume-intercepted rainfall\nOf the four landscape factors, which might have determined the current patterns of\nactivities of 137Cs, exploratory analysis suggested that both soil type and altitude\ncould account for a significant proportion of the variation in activities of 137Cs in\nthe area that received 15\u201320 mm of rainfall. Figure 6 shows the variograms of the\nresiduals when these two factors were used as predictors in linear regression models,\nand Table 2 lists the estimated parameters. Altitude accounts for a small proportion\nof the spatially correlated variance, whilst soil type accounts for a significantly larger\nproportion; 16% of the spatially correlated variance at both short (3 km) and longer\ndistances (20 km). When both factors are considered together the spatial structure\nin the residuals is complex; at short distances (<10 km) less variance is accounted\nfor than for soil type alone, but at longer distances (>10 km) there are independent\neffects which account for a greater proportion of the variance than each individually.\nThis suggests that common soil properties, captured by the soil classes, determine\nthe differential retention or vertical migration of 137Cs. The activities of 137Cs for the\nvarious soil types (Figure 8), reveal some notable differences in their distributions.\nThose soil types with finer textures (e.g. alluvium and many of the gleyed soils) tend\nto have greater median activities of 137Cs than the overall median. The disturbed land\nand Brown Earths have smaller medians (<2 kBq m\u22122). The lack of cover and coarse\nsoil texture favour leaching.\n137Cs distribution on the Mourne Mountains\nThere were 5745 survey points on the Mourne Mountains, and, as above, we computed\n17\nthe auto-variograms of both 137Cs and potassium and their cross-variogram and fitted\nto them a linear model of coregionalization. The results are displayed in Figure 7\nwith parameters listed in Table 5. The correlation range, approximately 1.2 km, is\nsubstantially shorter than that for Northern Ireland as a whole (ca 10 km) suggesting\nthat the soil varies in a more intricate pattern there.\nThere is a fairly strong, joint spatial correlation between activities of 137Cs and\nestimates of soil K (Figure 7c); the spatially structured correlation coefficient, Equa-\ntion (??), is \ud45f = 0.69. This suggests that the radiocaesium interception potential of the\nsoil could be estimated from the K content, or, perhaps better, from the illite content;\nillite has been reported as both a major and minor mineralogical component of these\nsoils (see McAlister et al., 1997). Caesium-137 is strongly adsorbed on frayed-edge sites\nof illite which are generated by weathering and possibly by the action of large hydrated\ncations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Comans et al., 1991). Our observation that 137Cs and\nK are jointly correlated for this area with a single, granitic parent material accords\nwith results of studies by Waegeneers et al. (1999) who showed that the radiocaesium\ninterception potential of soil depends on its geological origin.\nDiscussion\nIn estimating activities of 137Cs in soil across Northern Ireland we assumed that their\ndistribution with depth through the soil decreases exponentially; this was confirmed\nfor some sites, but at others this was not the case (see Methods section). A recent\npaper by Jarvis et al. (2010) might explain why to some extent. Earthworms ingest\nsoil to which 137Cs is adsorbed and move it down the profile and so dilute 137Cs near\nthe surface. Where the assumption concerning exponential decrease does not apply,\nairborne measurement will underestimate activities of 137Cs. This is more likely to\noccur in organic and sandy soils types, which have smaller radiocaesium interception\npotentials, than in silt and clay-rich soils. This could exaggerate the differences in\nactivities of 137Cs between soil types that we reported from our analysis. Without many\nmeasurements of 137Cs down the profile, however, we cannot quantify the magnitude\n18\nof this effect.\nPalsson et al. (2006) showed that one might be able to estimate the spatial dis-\ntribution of 137Cs fallout from weapons testing using long-term monitoring of 137Cs\ndeposition in combination with average annual precipitation data. They applied this\nmethod in Iceland. By subtracting global fallout from measurements of total activities\nof 137Cs one might be able to estimate the separate component derived from Cher-\nnobyl. We did not attempt to do this for the 137Cs data for Northern Ireland for two\nreasons. First, like Palsson et al., we were concerned that the error in estimating av-\nerage annual precipitation by interpolation from sparse rain gauges (ca 1 per 72 km2)\ncould lead to large errors in spatial estimates of global fallout. Estimates of annual\nprecipitation might be improved by topographic data and precipitation modelling, but\nthey were beyond the scope of this study. Second, the measurement error associated\nwith estimated activities of 137Cs from the airborne survey is too large to allow fine\ncomparisons of this kind. If we assume that the spatial component of the nugget vari-\nance is negligible for 137Cs \u2014which is reasonable given that the nugget variance in our\ncross-variogram of K and activities of 137Cs is negligible\u2014then the nugget variance in\nthe auto-variogram of the 137Cs activity, approximately 0.55 (kBq m\u22122)2, provides an\napproximation to the measurement error. It would not be possible to separate this\nerror from the error in estimation of global fallout.\nOur geostatistical analysis of the airborne survey data showed that activities of\n137Cs across Northern Ireland exhibits much variation over short distances, between\n<0.6 and 8 km. When radio-caesium is used to quantify soil erosion on agricultural\nland, the methodology relies on the assumption that it was originally distributed fairly\nuniformly and that any subsequent variation calculated from 137Cs inventories down\nindividual slopes is due largely to redistribution by erosion (Walling and Quine, 1991).\nThis assumption might be invalid for the large areas of pastoral land in Northern Ireland\nbecause of the short-range variation observed in the survey and because of the vertical\ntranslocation of the adsorbed 137Cs by earthworms mentioned above. However, when\n19\nwe analysed the spatial structure of activities of 137Cs for the relatively small area of\narable land (mean activities of 137Cs of 1.4 kBq m\u22122) we found no short-range structure\nsimilar to that observed for the region as a whole. This suggests that the arable land\nreceived little fallout from Chernobyl.\nConclusions\nThe main conclusions from our study are as follows.\n1. The spatial distribution of activities of 137Cs estimated for Northern Ireland from\na high-resolution airborne geophysical survey in 2005 and 2006 has a pronounced\nshort-range structure (<0.6\u20138 km) across the region, and a series of oriented\nbands with larger than average activities (>3.5 kBq m\u22122). The larger activities\nin these bands accord with the broad patterns of rainfall during the three days\n2, 3 and 4 May 1986 following the nuclear accident at Chernobyl on 26 April of\nthat year. However, the 137Cs distribution from the survey \u2014 which includes a\ncomponent of fallout from the testing of weapons \u2014 exhibits far greater spatial\ncomplexity than can be captured by the rainfall map of Smith and Clark (1989),\n2. Two grid-based topographic, landscape indices (compound topographic index and\nthe length\u2013slope factor from RUSLE) which relate to water, and loss and accu-\nmulation of sediment, account for less than 3% of the spatial variation in the\ndistribution of radio-caesium across all of Northern Ireland. This suggests that\nthe dominant controls on the movement of 137Cs at this regional scale are re-\ntention through adsorption followed by vertical migration, rather than lateral\ntransport.\n3. In combination, maps of land cover and soil type account for almost 20% of\nthe spatial variation in the distribution of radiocaesium in the region. Part of\nthe variation accounted for by these maps may be due to an artefact of the\nmeasurement process; spatial variation in the depth of migration of caesium-137\ncannot be accounted for in airborne survey, but this will influences estimates\n20\nof the activities of 137Cs. This highlights the importance of land use and soil\ntype, respectively, for the biogeochemical cycling of 137Cs and its retention, which\ncontrol the rate of vertical migration of the nuclide.\n4. Without estimates of 137Cs at a fine-resolution at different times one cannot de-\ntermine the relative importance of depositional pattern or landscape factors in\naccounting for the observed short-range spatial variation.\n5. Over the Mourne Mountains there is a fairly strong, positive joint spatial correlation\nbetween activities of 137Cs and K in the soil, both estimated from the airborne\nsurvey. This suggests that the radiocaesium interception potential of the soil is\ncorrelated with the soil\u2019s K content. It is likely to be due to the mineral illite\nwhich occurs in varying proportions in the soil there and weathered from the\ngranitic parent material.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Tellus project was funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Invest-\nment and by the Building Sustainable Prosperity Scheme of the Rural Development\nProgramme (Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Northern Ireland).\nWe acknowledge the huge survey effort undertaken by the Tellus and Joint Airborne-\nGeoscience Capability (JAC) teams.
