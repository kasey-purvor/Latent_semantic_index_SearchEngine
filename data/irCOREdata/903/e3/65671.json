In response, decentralised emergency \nnutrition programmes were introduced into much of southern Niger.  However, child \nmalnutrition is a chronic problem in Niger and links between food production, household \nfood security and child malnutrition are not straightforward.  This paper reports on a \nqualitative, anthropological study undertaken in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la Districts of rural \nNiger in the aftermath of the food crisis, investigating the pathways by which children \nare rendered vulnerable in the context of a nutritional \u2018emergency\u2019.  It focuses on \nhousehold-level decisions that determine resource allocation and childcare practices, in \nlight of wider household- and community-level dynamics.  This contextualisation helps to \nexplain why practices that are apparently detrimental to children\u2019s health persist. Risk \naversion, the need to maintain self-identity and status, and constrained decision-making, \nall brought about by long-term livelihood insecurity, result in a failure to invest extra \nnecessary resources in faltering children.  Negotiations of beliefs, gender roles and \nbargaining power within social networks are also crucial.  Understanding and \nresponding to these aspects of the social context of child malnutrition will help \nhumanitarian workers to integrate their efforts more effectively with longer-term \ndevelopment programmes aimed at improving livelihood security.   \n \nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS \nIn 2004-5, Niger suffered a food crisis, during which global attention became focused on \nhigh levels of acute malnutrition among children and high rates of infant and child \n 3 \nmortality. In response, decentralised emergency nutrition programmes, targeted mainly at \nchildren under five, were introduced into many of the affected areas of southern Niger.  \nNearly two years later (at the time of writing), the emergency nutrition programmes are \nstill operating widely, albeit with reduced admissions over recent months.  Acute \nmalnutrition has decreased among under 5s over the last year, but remains highly \nprevalent.  Emergency nutrition programmes have reported high rates of non-cured \ndischarges and drop-outs from the programme (FEWS NET, 2006: 6; Unicef Niger, \n2006).  It is widely accepted that the 2004-5 emergency was in fact an extreme \nmanifestation of a long-term problem, and that a much broader response is required to \ntackle it (Baro & Deubel, 2006).   \n \nIn this context Concern Worldwide, one of the agencies delivering the humanitarian \nprogramme, commissioned an anthropological study, early in 2006, with the aim of \nimproving understanding of the social context of child malnutrition and, in particular, to \nexamine care practices and household decision-making in relation to the nutritional \nvulnerability of children.  In this paper, we aim: \n(1) To describe childcare practices that, alongside poor household food security and \nhealth conditions, contribute to the nutritional vulnerability of children in part of \nNiger; \n(2) To explore underlying social, cultural and economic factors underpinning \napparently detrimental childcare practices. \n \n 4 \nBACKGROUND AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \nThe food crisis in the context of chronic food insecurity in Niger \nNiger is one of the world\u201fs poorest countries, ranking 177th of 177 countries on the UN \nHuman Development Index, a composite measure encompassing life expectancy, literacy, \nschool enrolment and Gross Domestic Product (UNDP, 2006).  In 2004, poor rains and \nlocust invasion led to poor harvests and widespread food shortages in Niger (and \nthroughout the Sahel).  Although the 2005 harvests were substantially better, food \nsecurity remained poor. Strategies adopted to cope with the previous year (including \nselling livestock, incurring debts, out-migration of men) had undermined longer-term \nlivelihood security (resilience of household livelihood systems to shocks), leaving many \nfamilies in a precarious position (Daulaire, 2005; Kapp, 2005). \n \nHowever, Baro and Deubel (among others) argued that the situation in 2004-05 was \u201cnot \na transitory emergency but a permanent feature of mounting vulnerability\u201d (2006:529).  \nGrowing population pressure, weak markets, land degradation, reduced income-\ngenerating opportunities, poor access to health services and sanitation, poor status of \nwomen, and harmful traditional feeding practices all conspire to render many Nigeriens \nvulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition (Baro & Deubel, 2006; Daulaire, 2005; \nKapp, 2005). This paper describes the social context of child malnutrition in two of the \nworst affected areas, Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la Districts.  \n \n 5 \nResponses to the food crisis \nIn these districts, emergency nutrition programmes for children were implemented by \nseveral agencies, including Concern Worldwide.  Admission to Concern\u201fs programme \nwas based on screening using anthropometric measures: firstly MUAC (middle-upper \narm circumference), then weight for height.  Those with moderate or severe acute \nmalnutrition were given nutritionally dense food supplements (PlumpyNut and Unimix) \nand medical care, and their progress was monitored until they had reached appropriate \nweight and were discharged from the programme.  In addition, families of children \nparticipating in the programme received a one-off ration of staple foods.  While many of \nthe agencies involved were also running longer-term development programmes, the \nemergency nutrition programmes were initially intended as short-term relief efforts, \ntargeted at saving the most vulnerable children (with risk determined by anthropometric \nstatus).  Alongside the distribution of food supplements and medicines ran limited water \nand sanitation programmes: providing clean water and latrines at food distribution centres \nand health centres; giving soap and providing hygiene education to people attending \ndistribution centres.   \n \nChildren\u2019s health and nutritional status \nNiger has persistently poor indicators for child health and mortality. In eight surveys \nconducted between 1996 and 2005, rates of global acute malnutrition (GAM) among \nchildren aged 6-59 months ranged from 13.4% to 24.0%, and rates of severe acute \nmalnutrition (SAM) ranged from 1.6% to 5.4%, with no systematic variation over the ten-\nyear period (FEWS NET, 2006).   In 2006, rates had improved somewhat (GAM, 10.3%; \n 6 \nSAM, 1.5%).  However levels of stunting indicative of chronic malnutrition were high: \n39.8% in 2000 and 50% in 2006 (Table 1). \n \nLocal data present a similar picture.  Concern Worldwide conducted a nutritional and \nhealth survey in December 2005 among children aged 6-59 months in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la \nDistricts (N=1851).  Figures for acute malnutrition were very high (GAM, 14.8%; SAM, \n2.4% (Table 1). In addition, high proportions of children were found to be stunted (38%), \nindicating chronic malnutrition. The 13-24 month olds experienced the highest rates of \nboth acute and chronic malnutrition (p(\u03c72)<0.001 for 13-24 months vs all other ages for \nboth wasting and stunting; figures 1 and 2).  No significant gender differences in \nnutritional status were found. \n \nA year later, as documented in Concern\u201fs follow-up survey in December 2006, the \nsituation had substantially improved (GAM, 8.1% and 9.5% for Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la \ndistricts respectively)  (Concern Worldwide, 2007).  Nonetheless, local communities still \nexperienced rates of high rates of malnutrition: according to WHO, a community-level \nprevalence of GAM of 5-9% indicates poor nutrition while 10-14% indicates serious \nmalnutrition (Young & Jaspars, 2006).  Furthermore, while rates of acute malnutrition \nwere found to vary seasonally (an expected finding, given the region\u201fs heavy reliance on \nsubsistence agriculture with a single harvest per year) (cf. Young & Jaspars, 1995a), they \nremained high throughout the year, never dropping below 8-9% (Concern Worldwide, \n2007).  The fact that levels of acute malnutrition for all age groups under 5 remain high \nthroughout the year, and even when the peak of the food crisis was over, suggests that \n 7 \nshort-term food shortages are not the only cause of malnutrition in this population and \nthat health and\/or childcare factors are also implicated\n1\n (cf. Young & Jaspars, 2006:19).  \nHigh prevalence rates for infectious diseases\/symptoms are documented by both national \nand local data (Table 1). \n Table 1 about here \n Figure 1 about here \n Figure 2 about here \n \nCauses of malnutrition in children \nThe relationships between food production, household food access, and child nutritional \nstatus are not straightforward.  Sen (1981) showed that household access to food \n(entitlements) can change rapidly in ways that do not necessarily correspond to food \nproduction or total food supply.  This is supported by Misselhorn\u201fs (2005) meta-analysis \nstudy in southern Africa, which found that household food security had relatively little to \ndo with levels of cereal production, and was instead driven by an array of social, political, \ncultural and economic processes.   \n \nThere is also no guarantee that household food security will mean adequate diets for all \nmembers.  As Messer (1997:1676) notes: \u201cin households that are food secure, some \nindividuals go hungry; while in households that are food insecure, some may be well \nnourished.\u201d  Childcare practices (including infant feeding, food preparation, health-\nseeking behaviour and supervision of children) can interact with household coping \nstrategies to mean that, even in households that appear to be relatively well-off, children \n 8 \nmay be malnourished (Heaton, Forsteb, Hoffmannc, & Flake, 2005).  For example, \nworking in Darfur, Young and Jaspars (1995a), found no clear relationship between \nhousehold wealth and acute malnutrition among children during the early stages of \nfamine.  This was because both wealthier and poorer households chose to reduce food \nintake, which might impact particularly on women and children if food was preferentially \nallocated to men, and because assets owned by wealthier households were not always \neasy to convert to income.  Moreover, biases in the intra-household resource allocation  \ncan both result in differential nourishment among children within the same household \n(Panter-Brick, 2002).   \n \nIntra-household dynamics reflect wider cultural and economic realities.  Sen (1985; 1990) \nhas described households as arenas of \u201ccooperative conflict\u201d, in which household \nmembers have different priorities (e.g., parents prioritizing their own children\u201fs \nhealthcare over that of other children in an extended household) and bargaining power.  \nIn Sen\u201fs model, bargaining power depends on differential fall-back positions (how \nindividuals would manage if a bargain were not reached, resulting in household \ndissolution).  In many patriarchal societies, the fallback position of women is worse than \nthat of men, but can improve, together with decision-making power, by earning external \nincome.  For example, Pfeiffer et al (2001) found that Mozambican mothers who earned \nmore than was required for daily household needs could spend the remainder as they \nchose, conferring greater bargaining power. \n \n 9 \nThe relationships between household-level decisions and the wider social, economic and \npolitical context are made explicit in Millard\u201fs (1994) model, which distinguishes three \ninterlinking tiers of causes of high child mortality.  These are: \n(a) proximate: malnutrition and infection; \n(b) intermediate: household food allocation and childcare practices, which lead to \ninadequate diets for some children and exposure to pathogens; \n(c) ultimate: macro-economic, political, ecological and social factors shaping \nhousehold food security and health. \nWhile most efforts to reduce child mortality are focused on the intermediate or proximate \ntiers (e.g. childcare education programmes), Millard argued that many apparently poor \nchildcare practices (e.g., poor quality weaning foods) are not the result of ignorance or \n\u201cculture\u201d, but of poverty and other factors beyond individual or household control \nconstraining parents\u201f choices. \n \nSimilarly, Young and Jaspars (2006:7) present a conceptual framework in which the \nproximate causes of child malnutrition, disease and death are influenced by three main \ngroups of intermediate factors: insufficient access to food; poor public health and \ninadequate health services; and inadequate maternal and child-care practices.  These, in \nturn, are influenced by resource availability and distribution, political ideology and \ncommitments. \n \n 10 \nIn this paper, we demonstrate ways in which household-level decisions impact on child \nnutritional vulnerability in part of Niger.  We then show how these decisions are \nconstrained by wider economic, social and cultural realities.   \n \nTHE STUDY \nData were collected as part of a qualitative, anthropological study undertaken in January-\nFebruary 2006 (some three months after the harvest) in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la Districts.  \nEthical approval for the study was granted by Durham University. \n \nArea and people \nThe study was conducted among all three major ethnic groups in the area: Hausa, Fulani \nand Tuareg.  All three practise Islam. Traditionally, the Hausa are agriculturalists, while \nthe Fulani and Tuareg are pastoralists, but loss of agro-pastoral livelihoods in recent years \nhas led to increasing mixing and diversification of livelihood strategies.  In particular, \nlarge numbers of young men leave to work abroad, mainly in Nigeria and Libya.  The \nHausa practise polygamy, with extended households comprising a man with his wives \nand children.  The Fulani and Tuareg are almost exclusively monogamous, but several \nbrothers might live together, with their wives and children, in extended households. \n \nField methods \nA range of qualitative methods were used to elicit local understanding and coping \npractices, with triangulation of material from different sources: \n 11 \n Semi-structured interviews with the main carers of young children (N=40 \nmothers, N=6 grandmothers); village chiefs and elders (N=13); key informants \n(NGO and village health centre staff, traditional birth attendants, traditional \nhealers, and representatives of women\u201fs organisations (N=25); and older siblings \n(9-18 year olds, N=9); \n Feeding and health histories, including 7-day dietary recall for children under 5 \n(N=44, of whom 35 were over 6 months old); \n Informal focus group discussions with mothers and grandmothers (N=15); \n Extensive consulting and de-briefing meetings with research assistants and staff \nfrom Concern Worldwide;  \n Direct participant observation, through staying in the villages throughout the \nperiod of fieldwork. \n \nSampling was purposive, to include households with diverse child nutritional status, \nlivelihood security, subsistence system, ethnic group, and distance from health services.  \nCurrent and recent health status was ascertained from children\u201fs growth and health \nrecords, which were used to inform the selection of participants; anthropometric data \nwere not specifically collected as part of this study.  Semi-structured interviews and focus \ngroups were conducted using interview checklists, adapted for each interview (Drever, \n1995).  Children\u201fs histories and dietary recall were collected using structured interviews. \nFocus groups were homogeneous with regard to gender, generation and ethnic group.  \nInterviews and focus groups were conducted in Hausa (the lingua franca), with two local \nresearch assistants translating.   \n 12 \n \nAnalysis was undertaken in consultation with local field assistants and key informants, \nenabling juxtaposition of emic and etic perspectives (Miles & Huberman, 1994).  This \nparticipatory approach to data analysis helps to ensure that the interpretations make sense \nlocally (Young & Jaspars, 1995b).  A series of validity checks was used: where cases \nwere found that did not fit with emergent theory, the theory was re-examined and \nevaluated in light of those cases (Bernard, 2002).   \n \nWhere appropriate, to complement qualitative findings, we performed a secondary \nanalysis of local survey data (Kokere, 2006), although the scope of this quantitative \nreview was limited due to lack of baseline data and ambiguity in the phrasing of some \nsurvey questions. \n \nRESULTS \nResults are presented in two parts.  First, we report on the intermediate-level factors that \ncontribute to the nutritional vulnerability of children in this part of Niger.  While \nhousehold access to foods and public health services are clearly important, we focus this \npaper on intra-household care factors, particularly allocation of resources for children.  \nSecond, we discuss a range of factors that impinge directly on household-level decisions \nrelating to childcare.  These relationships are summarised in figure 3.  We draw together \ninterview, recall and observational data to evaluate the range of pathways leading to child \nmalnutrition in this part of Niger, mindful that such pathways are often difficult to \n 13 \noperationalize and that our review of children\u201fs vulnerabilities and household dynamics \nstem from largely qualitative data. \n \n(1) CHILDCARE PRACTICES CONTRIBUTING TO NUTRITIONAL \nVULNERABILITY \n(a) Poor infant feeding practices \nA number of common breastfeeding and weaning practices represent serious risk factors \nfor infant nutritional status (cf. Daulaire, 2005).  These include delayed initiation of \nbreastfeeding and failure to give colostrum; early introduction of supplementary foods \nand traditional medicines; and early cessation of breastfeeding.    \n \nMothers commonly delay the initiation of breastfeeding, so as not to give colostrum to \nthe newborn infant.  According to the local survey, the proportion of mothers initiating \nbreastfeeding within 3 hours of birth was only 35.0% (N=927 respondents; Concern \n2006).  Our observations and dietary recall indicate that it is common practice to give \nregular water-based infusions of medicinal plants during at least the first forty days of \nlife, and also that early supplementation with millet-based foods is widespread. Thus the \nprevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among infants in Niger is extremely low; recent \nnational data from DHS give a figure of 13.5% for 0-6 month olds (INS-Niger, 2006).  \nLocal survey data show that 0% of mothers in Tahoua District and only 11% in Ill\u00e9la \nDistrict exclusively breastfed for 4-6 months.  The most common reason for cessation of \nbreastfeeding is subsequent pregnancy: 47.7% of breastfeeding mothers in Tahoua \nDistrict and 66.8% in Ill\u00e9la District had weaned their infant because of a new pregnancy \n 14 \n(Kokere, 2006).  Many mothers recounted a pattern of early supplementation, early \nsubsequent pregnancy, and early and abrupt cessation of breastfeeding.   \n \n(b) Failure to direct high quality foods towards young children \n The staple diet of young children is of poor nutritional quality, even though it is usually \nsufficient in quantity.  Our dietary recall and observational data show that the main (and \noften only) staple food eaten throughout the day is boule: millet mixed with much water \nand, if available, a small amount of sugar and curdled milk.  We were not able to conduct \nnutritional analysis of boule; however its variable but high water content and bulk make it \nunlikely to be nutritionally dense enough for young children who have small stomachs \nand relatively high nutritional needs.  When resources allow, a \u201cfamily dish\u201d is eaten in \nthe evening (usually millet porridge or rice, with milk or sauce).  However, very few \nchildren ate such a dish every day.  \n \n As supplies from the year\u201fs millet harvest diminished, mothers reportedly added more \nand more water to the boule and the frequency of \u201cfamily dishes\u201d decreased.  Addition of \nmilk to boule also varies seasonally, according to availability and cost: milk supply \ntypically diminishes in the dry season and also at times of year when herds are far from \nthe homestead.  Dietary recall for 35 children aged 6-60 months, show that 18 (51%) had \neaten only boule in the preceding 24 hours, while 7 (20%) had eaten only boule in the \npreceding week (with no differences by sex, age (post-weaning) or birth order).  Boule is \nleft in a calabash for all the family to consume at will.  Because it rarely runs out, even in \n 15 \nthe pre-harvest hungry seasons, most mothers conclude that all their children have \nenough to eat:  \n\u201cI put plenty of boule in the dish and there is always some left over, so I know \nthey have all had enough.  If it runs out, I add some more.\u201d (Hausa mother)  \n \nWhile boule is available to all household members to help themselves freely, foods of \nhigher quality are distributed more formally.  Men are served first, and typically get the \nbest bits (e.g., meat).  Children over the age of one eat from a common plate, separately \nfrom adults, who thus have little control over how much, or what, each child actually \neats.   \n \n(c) Poor hygiene practices and uptake of health services  \nHand-washing before food preparation, before eating or after defecation was observed \nvery rarely.  Moreover, food (particularly boule) is often left in an open calabash for up to \n48 hours.  Agencies running feeding programmes have attempted to improve the situation \nby providing soap and hygiene education, as well as clean water at distribution centres.  \nHowever, access to clean water \u2013 and in many areas, access to any water - is clearly a \nmajor limiting factor in attempts to improve hygiene levels.  Only 43% of Niger\u201fs \npopulation has access to clean potable water, and 18% to sanitation facilities (Kapp, \n2005).   \n \nUptake of preventative and curative health services for children is likewise very poor.  \nIllness histories indicate that children are rarely taken to a health centre for illnesses \n 16 \nconsidered to be commonplace (i.e. fever, diarrhoea, respiratory infections).  34 children \n(aged 0-60 months) were reported to have had a serious illness in the preceding six \nmonths, of whom 11 (32%) were reportedly taken to a clinic.  This probably represents \nan over-estimate of proportions attending clinics, since observational and interview data \nstrongly suggest under-reporting of illnesses and over-reporting of clinic attendance.   \n \nThe formal Niger health system operates under the Bamako Initiative, requiring citizens \nto pay for basic drugs. It is under-resourced in terms of staff, infrastructure, and \nequipment. Distance, cost and misinformation all prevent parents from taking sick \nchildren to health centres; they either do not treat sick children at all, or first access other, \nless effective, treatment options, particularly the pharmacies ambulantes - itinerant, \nusually untrained, vendors of medicines, who often provide inappropriate  treatments, but \nat low prices and close to home. \n  \nIn interviews, parents rarely distinguished discrete episodes of these illnesses, seeing \nthem instead as chronic and often intrinsic to a child: \u201cHe has always had malaria.\u201d  \nSuch a child might be taken to the clinic once if parents perceived the situation to be very \nserious or life-threatening.  But if recovery is incomplete or unsustained, further \ntreatment is generally not pursued.  This Fulani mother\u201fs account of her malnourished \nand clearly sick two-year-old daughter is typical: \u201cOnly once, when she was very ill and \nwould not wake up easily, we took her to the clinic.  But then she became ill again.  Since \nthen, we have just treated her at home.\u201d \n \n 17 \n(d) Failure to dedicate extra resources to sick or failing children \nCompounding this failure to take sick children for healthcare, it is rare for a child who \nbecomes sick, or suffers a set-back (such as abrupt weaning), to receive extra resources to \nprevent malnutrition.  Sick children are not usually given special foods (high quality or \neasy to digest); indeed cultural practices of food distribution make it very difficult for \nparents to single out a child for special treatment.  In only one case of abrupt weaning in \nthe feeding histories did the carer (grandmother) give the child special food and extra \ncare, and she acknowledged that she was unusual in doing this. \n \n(2) WIDER CONSTRAINTS ON CHILD-CARE PRACTICES AND HOUSEHOLD \nDECISION-MAKING \nIn this section, we unravel some of the wider contextual factors influencing the seemingly \ndetrimental childcare practices described above.  As shown in figure 3, we identify four \nmain issues that underpin household decision-making with regard to allocation of \nresources to children: \n poverty and livelihood insecurity, leading to risk aversion and constrained \ndecision-making; \n identity and status; \n intra-household gender relations and bargaining power; \n negotiation of beliefs and practices. \nThe broader context of ecology and subsistence practices and the macro-level national \nand international political economy are beyond the scope of this paper. \n \n 18 \n(a) Poverty and livelihood insecurity, leading to risk aversion and constrained \ndecision-making \nMany informants attested to the long-term nature of child malnutrition.  While parents \nwelcomed the efforts of international donors to provide emergency nutrition for their \nchildren, they were clearly worried about what would happen when the programmes \nended.  Long-term livelihood insecurity is a persistent problem in Niger.  While many \ninterviewees said that the year 2004-05 had been worse than usual in terms of food \nsecurity, they also stressed that livelihoods have been poor for the last few decades and \nthat problems of food security were perennial.  One Hausa woman summarised the \ngeneral situation as follows: \u201cWe don\u2019t even harvest enough to last half the year.  It is \nonly by the grace of God that we survive\u201d. \n \nSet against persistent livelihood insecurity, children\u201fs lives are seen as inherently \nvulnerable. Parents sense that any child may suddenly become ill and die at any time.  \nParental intervention appears not enough to secure the life of a sick or failing child, as \nthis Hausa mother recounts:  \n\u201cHe [her dead son] was always very little and didn\u2019t drink much milk.  We took \nhim to the clinic twice and got medicine for him.  But he became ill again and \ndied.\u201d   \n \nParents\u201f reluctance to invest extra resources in a sick child is part of an understandable \nrisk management strategy (Hampshire, Panter-Brick, & Casiday, forthcoming)  Resources \nused to purchase high quality food or medicines for a sick child must be offset against the \n 19 \nneed to maintain productive capital, especially livestock and land.  The first part of \nFatima\u201fs account (case A) illustrates the trade-offs that parents face between the needs of \na sick child and maintaining household assets.   \n Case A here \n \n(b) Identity and status \nOther research in food crises has shown that preserving dignity and self-respect are at \nleast as important to people as preserving productive assets and fending off starvation \n(Chambers, 2006 [1989]; De Wall, 1989; Howe, 2002).  Similarly, parents\u201f accounts in \nNiger emphasised the importance of maintaining dignity and social capital.  As Fatima \nexplains (case A), there is a strong social imperative to maintain symbolic capital in the \nform of her wedding trousseau (decorated plates and calabashes that a woman brings to \nher new home on marriage), even at the cost of being able to afford medicines for her \ndaughter.  Apart from loss of self-esteem, there may be very real costs attached to the loss \nof social status and capital. \n \nParents\u201f accounts suggested that considerations of status are one reason that wealth does \nnot appear to protect children from malnutrition in this context (Young & Jaspars, \n1995a).  For example, one mother from a relatively wealthy household\n2\n explained that \nthey had continued to hire wage-labour they could ill afford and were too ashamed to \ntake their child to the emergency nutrition programme.  By \u201closing face\u201d in the short-\nterm, such families would risk forfeiting their position as \u201cbig people\u201d within their \n 20 \nvillage.  That status afforded them considerable power over village-level decisions, with \npotentially far-reaching consequences on their wellbeing. \n \n(c) Intra-household gender relations and bargaining power \nMothers\u201f economic autonomy and decision-making power can constrain their access to \nnutritional and health resources for their children.  This is particularly important in less \ncooperative households, or in cases of absent husbands.  In this part of Niger, men and \nwomen tend to control separate budgets, particularly among the polygamous Hausa.  \nHausa women are reluctant to share their goods with their husbands, since the goods \ncould then end up going to a co-wife.  One Hausa woman with a small field of her own \nreported selling millet to her own husband for the household granary.  The monogamous \nFulani and Tuareg households are often said to be more cooperative arenas, but the high \nfrequency of divorce discourages spouses from sharing assets.  Moreover, in extended \nTuareg and Fulani households, there may be considerable lack of cooperation between \nthe different brothers and their wives. \n \nWe found substantial differences in mothers\u201f bargaining power, reflected in their ability \nto secure resources for their children.  In extended polygamous households, a mother\u201fs \nstatus (based on considerations like reproductive success, own family background and \nperceived sexual desirability) can be critical.  As one Hausa woman put it: \u201cThe children \nof the first wife are more likely to be neglected, while [the father] takes more notice of the \nchildren of a new wife.\u201d \n \n 21 \nLack of cooperation in extended households becomes particularly important when men \nare absent on exode (labour migration).  In Concern\u201fs survey, 24.7% of households in \nTahoua and Ill\u00e9la Districts were de facto female-headed at the time of the survey \n(Kokere, 2006).  This was due largely to male labour migration, accounting for 76.0% of \nfemale-headed households (ibid).  Although exode of fathers was not found to be \nassociated with child nutritional status (for children aged 6-59m, mean WHZ was -1.12 \nfor those with fathers present versus -1.21 for children with fathers en exode (T-test, \np=0.10)), our qualitative work highlights important but ambiguous effects of exode that \nmay be concealed in quantitative data.  \n \nExode can be an important means of supplementing household income, and is \nacknowledged by both men and women to play a critical role in livelihood security (in \ncase A, Fatima sold her own goats to enable her husband to migrate).  However, exode \noften leads to shifts in intra-household power relations and decision-making.  Some \nwomen gain more control of immediate household resources in their husbands\u201f absence.  \nIn other cases, control of household resources is delegated to another family member or \nneighbour, compromising a woman\u201fs ability to negotiate an adequate share of resources \nfor her children (cf. Hampshire, 2006; Ruthven & David, 1995).  In Fatima\u201fs case, where \nthere is intra-household cooperation and understanding, the absence of a husband can still \nimpinge negatively on a mother\u201fs ability to respond effectively to the health needs of her \nchildren.  In case B, typical of an uncooperative extended family, the woman has limited \noptions and must appeal to her wider social networks.  \nBox 2 about here \n 22 \n \nThe problems arising from uncooperative households and\/or absent fathers can be \nmitigated if women are able to draw effectively on their own social networks for support.  \nIn case B, Hawa\u201fs position is improved by having an older sister who is able and willing \nto provide for her children.  An independent source of income can also make a difference.  \nIn this respect, Fulani women who sell butter and milk are better off than their Hausa or \nTuareg counterparts.  For example:  \n\u201cWhen my daughter became ill, I took her to Affala [village with health centre].  \nThey gave her an injection and an intravenous drip, which cost 3000F [$6] \u2026 I \npaid for the treatment, using the money I got from selling milk in Tahoua.\u201d (Fulani \nmother, whose husband had migrated) \n \nThe practice of seclusion, adopted by conservative families, also limits women\u201fs freedom \nof movement, their ability to earn income independently, or their opportunities to \ndevelop, maintain and contact wider social networks. \n \n(d) Negotiation of beliefs and practices \nCultural norms for infant and child feeding also have deleterious outcomes for child \nhealth and nutrition.   \n \nThere is a proscription against breastfeeding while pregnant.  The breastfeeding child is \nbelieved to be \u201cstealing\u201d milk from its unborn sibling, or a pregnant woman\u201fs milk is \nperceived as \u201chot\u201d and potentially harmful to a breastfeeding child, causing illness and \n 23 \neven death.  Many mothers (particularly Hausa mothers), recognized that abrupt weaning \ncould be harmful, and so introduced supplemental foods early in case they became \npregnant again:  \u201cIf I become pregnant, it will not be such a shock to [the child], since he \nis getting used to eating boule\u201d (Hausa mother).  Clearly, there is a serious risk here of \ncreating a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby short birth intervals are more likely because \nof early supplementation. \n \nBeliefs about when to start breastfeeding and the value of colostrum were mixed.  Many \nyounger women and more recently trained midwives had absorbed the public health \nmessage about the importance of early breastfeeding initiation.  However, older women \nand midwives commonly saw colostrum as useless or even harmful to infants.  Two \nmidwives we interviewed advocated withholding the breast until several days had passed \n(giving sugar water in the meantime) and the quality of the milk had been approved (e.g. \nby checking its colour to prove it was \u201cgood\u201d).  Fears about having \u201cbad milk\u201d also led \nsome mothers to supplement or wean early.  A frequently ill infant was taken as an \nindication of \u201cbad milk\u201d and withdrawn from the breast at a particularly vulnerable time. \n  \nAnother cultural belief contributing to mothers\u201f reluctance to give high quality foods to \nsick children is the condition known as \u201canugu\u201d (fever and rash), believed to result from \ngiving and then suddenly withdrawing high quality foods, especially milk.  Fear of anugu \nextended to the emergency feeding programme, with mothers fearing that children \nbecome too accustomed to the high-quality supplemental foods and find it difficult to re-\nadjust to every-day household foods when discharged.  Many compared discharge from \n 24 \nthe programme to an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding, in terms of risks to the child, and \none woman called it a \u201csecond sevrage\u201d (a second weaning).   \n \nHowever, it is important to note that beliefs are not static and unchanging, nor are they \nheld in the same way by everyone.  Moreover, the relationship between stated belief and \npractice is not straightforward.  Although women ubiquitously stated that mothers, in \ngeneral, should not continue to breastfeed while pregnant, careful questioning of \nindividual feeding histories revealed a different story.  For example, one Fulani woman \ndescribed how she had concealed her pregnancy for several months in order to continue \nbreastfeeding her son without condemnation.  She was not unique among our informants, \nand it became clear that several women \u201cbent the rules\u201d as far as breastfeeding during \npregnancy was concerned. Similarly, despite cultural imperatives to share foods equally \nand avoid giving special, high quality foods to sick children, it became clear from \nmothers\u201f accounts that this was not always followed in practice. \n \nMoreover, beliefs and practice are often subject to negotiation.  For example, several \nyoung women said that they had been informed by young, recently-trained midwives that \nbabies benefited from breastfeeding immediately after birth; yet they delayed \nbreastfeeding initiation at the insistence of their own mothers.  The risks of disobeying \none\u201fs mother and potentially damaging relations with the natal family (the major fallback \nin the event of marital dissolution) were seen to be very substantial.  Mothers held \nparticular influence for the first child, since daughters usually return to their natal homes \nto give birth for the first time.  With subsequent children, many were able to ignore their \n 25 \nmothers\u201f advice and start breastfeeding straightaway (without disclosing this to their \nmothers). \n \nSUMMARY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nChildcare practices, including intra-household allocation of food and health resources, \nmust be understood within the range of constraints under which parents operate.  These \ninclude chronic livelihood insecurity, with the concomitant need to maintain productive \nassets and social and symbolic capital.  There also hinge upon power relations in local \nhouseholds, with shifts of balance for example due to widespread out-migration (exode) \nand polygamy.  Far from being static, childcare practices are subject to continual \nnegotiation. \n \nPingali et al (2005) have argued that successful intervention in situations of protracted \ncrisis must be based on \u201ca multi-disciplinary understanding of communities and their \nfood systems.\u201d  In the analysis above, we endeavour to present one part of this picture in \nrelation to Niger.  Clearly there are other relevant aspects to this picture, such as \necological, economic and political contexts which we have not reviewed in this paper.  \n \nWe see several policy implications from this analysis, specifically addressing the range of \nfactors that constrain household decision-making with regard to detrimental childcare \npractices. \n \n 26 \n(1) Investing in understanding the social context \nWe have shown that local beliefs and practices combine with identity, livelihood \nconstraints and processes of negotiation and decision-making within the household to \ninfluence children\u201fs wellbeing in ways that are not easy to predict without understanding \nthe local situation in some detail.  In a crisis situation, undertaking a detailed study might \nseem to be too costly and time-consuming.  However, locally-recruited NGO staff and \ncommunity workers are usually very knowledgeable about local practices and other \nfactors that lead to child nutritional vulnerability, and this highly nuanced knowledge of \nlocal realities, constraints, beliefs and practices could very usefully feed into a more \nintegrated initiative.  The challenge for emergency nutrition programmes is to make \nenough time and space to allow such observations and knowledge to shape the \nprogramme, rather than simply employing them to deliver a top-down initiative.   \n \n(2) Women\u2019s economic autonomy \nOur study has shown how mothers\u201f independent income and social networks can increase \ntheir ability to secure crucial health and nutritional resources for their children, \nparticularly in the context of male out-migration.  It must, therefore, be a priority to \nincrease the economic autonomy of mothers through, for example, income-generating \nactivities or enhancing local micro-credit and savings schemes.  However, any efforts to \nenhance income-generation among mothers must take careful account of the wider \ncontext and the constraints (e.g. already high workloads) within which they operate.  \nPractices of seclusion and status within households also impact on what is possible for \n 27 \nwomen in terms of income generation, so getting the support of other household members \n(e.g. fathers) might be critical.  \n \n(3) Reducing costs of healthcare for children \nHumanitarian agencies are now working with the Ministry of Health to address some of \nthe constraints on parents\u201f ability to access curative health care for their children.  There \nis also scope for community-based activities in this area, such as working with local and \ntraditional healthcare providers (often chosen by parents in preference to formal health \nservices because they can be cheaper and more readily accessible) to improve their \nknowledge of child health, nutrition and hygiene issues.  For example, community-based \nsavings and credit schemes can be aimed specifically at providing health insurance for \nchildren. \n \n(4) Supporting sustainable dietary improvements for children \nAs noted above, many parents worried about their ability to continue to provide a high \nquality diet to their children once they were discharged from the nutrition programme.   \nThe diversity and quality of diets could be improved through community-based initiatives \nto support livestock ownership and gardening, and possibly to produce local versions of \nfood like PlumpyNut.  This might also help to reduce concerns about anugu.  However, \nalongside initiatives aimed at increasing household access to food, more needs to be done \nto encourage parents to direct what high quality foods are available towards young and \nvulnerable children, through increasing awareness of their special nutritional needs.  \nSimilarly, better targeted support for breastfeeding should be an integral part of nutrition \n 28 \nprogramming in Niger, drawing perhaps on the fact that prolonged breastfeeding is \nendorsed by Islam.  With any awareness-raising programmes, it is important to consider \ncarefully which groups to target and how.  We have shown that beliefs and practice \naround infant and child feeding are complex and negotiated, and that mothers do not \nnecessarily have the power to act autonomously.  Thus, breastfeeding support \nprogrammes should target grandmothers as well as mothers, and education about the \nnutritional needs of young children should incorporate the extended family, not just the \nparents. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe emergency nutrition programmes in Niger have done important work which was \nmuch appreciated by the respondents in our study, and programmes providing emergency \ntreatment for already malnourished children have a vital role to play.  However, it is now \nclear to the humanitarian agencies working in Niger that they are dealing with a \nprotracted crisis, which involves moving to a more integrated \u201ctwin track approach\u201d, \naddressing both short-term needs (saving lives) and the longer-term causes of nutritional \nvulnerability (Pingali et al., 2005: 6).  In particular, we have argued that understanding \nand addressing the wider social, cultural and economic factors that underpin household \ncoping and childcare strategies will be crucial.  Tensions between short- and longer-term \ninterventions mean that this is not always easy to achieve in practice (Flores, Khwaja, & \nWhite, 2005; Gross & Webb, 2006).  However, adequate prevention activities in the \nbroadest sense must also be implemented alongside the treatment programmes, and both \nshould be gradually mainstreamed into health services and livelihoods programmes. \n 29 \nWithout this breadth of focus, \u201eemergency\u201f nutrition programme providers may continue \nto find themselves responding to widespread acute malnutrition in Niger for the long \nhaul. \n \nNOTES \n1.

She talks here of her 18 month-old daughter, who has recently been discharged \nfrom the emergency nutrition programme.   \n \nFatima: My daughter had diarrhoea.  After three weeks it was getting no better, and I saw \nblood in the diarrhoea, so I took her to the CSI [the nearby health centre].  The \ndoctor said that because there was blood in her stools, she had to have pills, \nwhich cost 350F, instead of just ORS sachets.  This didn\u2019t help and after three \ndays we went back again and had to pay 700F.  The doctor sent us to another \nhealth centre, where we paid 2.500F for injections and intravenous drip. \nKH: Where did you get the money for the treatment? \nFatima: My husband gave me 5.000F.  This was the money we had got from selling beans \nand millet after the harvest.  It was supposed to pay for my husband to go en \nexode.  Because we used this money to buy medicine, I had to sell eight of my \ngoats to pay for him to travel.  [She explains that her husband\u2019s goats were all \nsold last year.]  I only have two goats left, and the milk is not enough for my \nchildren.  Now my husband is away and my daughter is sick again \u2013 she is \ncoughing and has had a fever for several days, but I have no money to take her to \nCSI.  If I sell one of these two goats, we will have nothing left. \nKH: [Pointing to the many plates on the wall] Could you sell some plates if you need \nmoney to take your daughter to the health centre? \nFatima: It would be possible for me to sell some plates, but I never have.  It would be too \nshameful to sell even one of them \u2013 I could never do that.  People would say that \nmy husband is no good.  After the harvest, I bought more plates for 4.500F. \nKH: What about your husband\u2019s brother?  Will he give you money to take your daughter \nto the CSI? \nFatima: He is kind, and the relations between our two families are good.  But it is still \nharder to get him to help than my husband, when he is here.  My daughter has \nbeen coughing for the last few nights.  If my husband were here, he too would \nhave noticed, and I could have asked him to for money to take her to the clinic.  \nBut I don\u2019t feel that I can ask his brother for help unless she becomes very \nseriously ill.  \n 38 \nCase B: Limited options of mothers with migrant husbands and reliance on extra-\nhousehold networks \n \nHawa\u201fs husband has been on exode in Libya for the last three years.  She has four living \nchildren: none are in the Concern programme, but Hawa worries that they don\u201ft have \nenough to eat.  Unprompted, she points to the couple of goats in her courtyard and \nexplains:  \n \nHawa: If it were up to me, I would sell these goats to buy more food for my children.  But \nI cannot sell them \u2013 they belong to my husband. \nKH: Who decides what happens to the goats while your husband is away? \nHawa: My husband\u2019s brothers. They live in [another village, several km away] and they \nrefuse to allow me to sell one. \nKH: Does your husband send you money? \nHawa: He rarely sends anything.  When he does, he sends it all to his brothers.  \nKH: So how do you manage for food? \nHawa: My husband\u2019s brothers sometimes buy millet for me.  But I never see any of the \nmoney myself.  My husband has not been here this year to cultivate our field and \nhis brothers have not helped, so I grew millet myself.  At least this millet is mine \nand my brothers-in-law do not touch it.  But this year I only harvested 12 bundles \nand these have already gone.  I manage by pounding millet for other women in \nthe village and they give me a bit. \nKH: What happens if one of your children is ill?  Do your husband\u2019s brothers help out \nthen? \nHawa: Sometimes when one of my children has been ill, I ask my husband\u2019s brothers for \nhelp, but they have never helped and now I don\u2019t bother asking them any more.  I \nhave an older sister who is married in [nearby village].  She is like a mother to \nme.  Her husband\u2019s family are wealthy and she helps me out.   \n \n \n \n 39 \n  \n \n \nTable 1: Health status for children aged 6-59 months: growth (wasting and stunting) \nprevalence (preceding two weeks) of infections. \n \n Niger, \nSurveys \nfrom1996 to \n2005\n1\n     \nNiger, \n1998 \nDHS\n2\n \nNiger, \n2006  DH \n3\n \nTahoua and \nIll\u00e9la \nDistricts, \nNiger, \nSurvey in \nDec 2005\n4\n \nTahoua and \nIll\u00e9la \nDistricts, \nNiger, \nSurvey in \nDec 2006\n5\n \nPercentage malnutrition rates \nWasting: Global Acute Malnutrition, \nGAM: Z-scores weight-for-height \u2264-2 \n13.4-24.0      20.7 10.3 14.8 \n \nTahoua: 8.1  \nIll\u00e9la: 9.5 \nWasting: Severe Acute Malnutrition, \nSAM, Z-scores weight-for-height \u2264-3 \n1.6-5.4 3.7 1.5 2.4  \nStunting: Global Chronic Malnutrition \nGCM, Z-scores height-for-age \u2264-2 \n 38.0 50.0 38.0  \n      \nPercentage infection rates \nFever  48.3  66  \nDiarrhoea  37.8  11  \nAcute Respiratory Infections  14.2  10  \nSources: \n1\n FEWS NET, 2006; \n2 \nDHS 1999;\n 3\nINS-Niger, 2006; \n4\n Kokere 2006; \n5\nConcern \nWorldwide, 2007. \n \n(Concern Worldwide, 2007; DHS, 1998; FEWS NET, 2006; INS-Niger, 2006; Kokere, \n2006) \n \n \n"}
