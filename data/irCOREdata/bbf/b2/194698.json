Lowe*\nReceived (in Cambridge, UK) 6th October 2004, Accepted 22nd October 2004\nFirst published as an Advance Article on the web 8th December 2004\nDOI: 10.1039\/b415464a\nOn binding to human serum albumin (HSA), the Eu(III)\nluminescent emission enhancement of a complex containing a\nbinaphthyl chromophore enables the determination of binding\nconstants, showing no chiral discrimination for the (R)-\n(K 5 8200 \u00a1 810 M21) and (S)-enantiomers (K 5 7710 \u00a1\n460 M21).\nThe use of gadolinium(III)-based contrast agents in magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) continues to increase.1 The intensity of\nthe signal in MRI is dependent on the relaxation rates of water\nmolecules, which are increased in the presence of paramagnetic\nions such as Gd(III). Contrast agents directed towards vascular\nimaging have been developed by incorporation of hydrophobic\nmoieties into Gd(III)-based contrast agents.2 This enables non-\ncovalent binding to hydrophobic sites on the protein human serum\nalbumin (HSA). The resultant compartmentalization, and relaxa-\ntion rate enhancement brought about by slowing down the rate of\ntumbling (lengthening tR, the rotational correlation time) achieves\nthis goal. However, the expected maximum relaxation rate\nenhancements of HSA-bound Gd(III) complexes is rarely observed,\noften due to independent rotations of the bound complex (and also\nin some cases, due to slower water exchange rates).1,3 We have\nsought to address this issue by designing a new ligand for\nGd(III) incorporating a rigid, chiral, hydrophobic 3,5-dihydro-\n4H-dinaphth[2,1-c:19,29-e]azepine moiety into a DOTA-based\nligand. The rigidity of this binding group, coupled with the amide\nlink is designed to minimize independent rotation of the\nGd(III)-complex once bound to HSA.\nSpectroscopic techniques that are inaccessible to Gd(III) are\navailable for its neighbors in the periodic table. In particular the\nluminescence behavior of Eu(III) complexes provides a valuable\nstructural probe for corresponding Gd(III) analogues. Herein, we\nreport the luminescent properties of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers\nof 3, and their binding affinities for HSA, determined by the\nluminescent enhancement of the HSA-bound complex.\nComplexes (R)- and (S)-3 were synthesized from the corres-\nponding enantiopure 2,29-bis[bromomethyl]-1,19-binaphthyl (2) as\nshown in Scheme 1. The monoamide derivative of DOTA, 1 was\nreacted with 2 in the presence of NaH in DMF, followed by\nremoval of tbutyl groups in TFA to yield the pro-ligand, which\nwas then reacted with EuCl3?6H2O to yield (R)- or (S)-3.\n1H NMR spectra of (R)-3 and (S)-3 were identical, and typical4\nof DOTA-like complexes of Eu(III), showing resonances in the\nrange 220 to + 40 ppm. The resonances shifted to highest\nfrequency (34 to 40 ppm) correspond to four of the eight axial ring\nhydrogens. Resonances in this range are indicative of the square\nantiprismatic coordination geometry (the so-called M isomer).4\nDue to the non-symmetrical nature of the ligand, four resonances\nare expected in this range. However, in both (R)- and (S)-3 two\nsets of four (i.e. eight in total) resonances are noted, corresponding\nto two diastereomers of the square antiprismatic geometry. This is\na result of the chirality of the binaphthyl moiety, which is\nsufficiently remote that little influence is exerted on the helicity of\nthe complex (often in the presence of chiral groups, one single\ndiastereomer is formed in preference).4 A 60 : 40 mixture (non-\nassignable) of the two diastereomers appears in solution,\ncorresponding to (e.g. for (R)-3) (R)-D(llll) and (R)-L(dddd)\nstereoisomers. (S)-3 shows an identical spectrum, as the enantio-\nmers of (R)-3 square antiprismatic geometries are observed, i.e.\n(S)-L(dddd) and (S)-D(llll) respectively.\n(R)- and (S)-3 show interesting luminescence behavior (Fig. 1).\nIn phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4, excitation of the\nbinaphthyl chromophore results in typical fluorescent emission\nfrom binaphthyl (lmax 5 383 nm), however, emission is also seen\n(at about the same intensity) from europium (y575\u2013710 nm for\nDJ 5 0 to DJ 5 4 transitions). This emission is sensitized via\nenergy transfer from the binaphthyl chromophore. Luminescent\nlifetime measurements in H2O and D2O enable the hydration state\n{ Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Synthesis, 1H\nNMR spectrum (3), luminescence spectra, binding constant determination.\nSee http:\/\/www.rsc.org\/suppdata\/cc\/b4\/b415464a\/\n*mplowe@le.ac.uk Scheme 1\nCOMMUNICATION www.rsc.org\/chemcomm | ChemComm\nThis journal is \u0001 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005 Chem.

The presence of one inner-\nsphere water molecule is vital if the Gd(III) analogue is to be used\nas a contrast agent.\nIn the presence of HSA, at imaging concentrations (0.1 mM 3,\n4.5% HSA), the nature of the emission spectrum changes markedly\n(see supporting information). The excitation spectrum shifts by\ny20 nm to longer wavelength (lmax 5 303 nm in PBS and\nlmax 5 323 nm in PBS + 4.5% HSA). The fluorescence from the\nbinaphthyl is now essentially quenched; the major emission in this\nregion corresponds to the solitary tryptophan residue in the\nprotein (lex 5 320 nm excites the tail of the tryptophan absorption\nband). However, a dramatic y6.5-fold increase in intensity of\nEu(III) emission is noted, i.e. the Eu(III) luminescence is essentially\nswitched on when the complex is bound to HSA. This can be\nclearly seen in Fig. 2. It is most likely that this large increase in\nemission intensity is due to more efficient energy transfer from the\nbinaphthyl chromophore to Eu(III) in the presence of protein. The\nshift in wavelength of the excitation spectrum of the HSA-bound\ncomplex indicates a lowering of the energy of the singlet excited\nstate of the chromophore, it is therefore expected that the triplet\nexcited state energy will also have lowered and thus be better\nmatched with the 5D0 excited state of Eu (17240 cm\n21) leading to\nmore efficient energy transfer. The change in absorption maximum\nin moving from an aqueous environment to the hydrophobic\nenvironment of the HSA binding site is expected. The enhance-\nment of Eu luminescence is not due to a change in hydration state\nfrom q 5 1 to q 5 0. Luminescent lifetime measurements confirm\nthat the complex remains in possession of an inner-sphere water\nmolecule on binding to HSA (q 5 0.82, tH2O 5 0.75 ms,\ntD2O 5 2.52 ms).\nThe Eu(III) luminescence enhancement on binding to HSA was\nused to determine the binding affinities of (R)- and (S)-3 for HSA.\nThe binding curve for (R)-3 is shown in Fig. 3. A binding constant\nK 5 8200\u00a1 810 M21 is observed for (R)-3. The data fits well to a\n1 : 1 binding isotherm; it is common to observe only one strong\naffinity site on HSA for such complexes.1,2\nSome differentiation was anticipated between the (R)- and\n(S)-enantiomers of 3, when binding to HSA. However, rather\nsurprisingly, the (S)-enantiomer has essentially the same binding\naffinity (K 5 7710 \u00a1 460 M21). It has previously been\ndemonstrated that (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the contrast agent\nGd-EOB-DTPA have very different affinities for HSA, however\nfor 3 no chiral discrimination was observed.6\nContrast agents have been shown to bind to regions in HSA\ndenoted sites I and II (in sub-domains IIA and IIIA respec-\ntively).1,2,7 Site I contains the solitary tryptophan residue of the\nprotein, and, as the fluorescence from this residue is not perturbed\nupon binding of 3, it is likely that 3 binds to site II. The binding\nconstants obtained for (R)- and (S)-3 indicate y83% of the com-\nplexes are bound to the protein at MR imaging concentrations.\nIn conclusion, we have developed a ligand system for Gd(III)\nbearing a rigid hydrophobic group, designed to bind to HSA. We\nhave demonstrated via luminescent studies on the corresponding\nEu(III) complex a relatively high affinity for HSA for these\ncomplexes. The luminescent emission from Eu(III) is dramatically\nenhanced on binding to the protein, and no chiral discrimination is\nobserved for (R)- or (S)-3. Relaxation rate measurements on the\ncorresponding Gd(III) complex are underway, as are modifications\nto the ligand structure designed to enhance the binding affinity for\nHSA, and to increase water exchange rates thereby maximizing the\nrelaxation rate enhancement of the bound complex. This will be\nachieved by incorporation of negatively charged residues on the\nperiphery of the ligand, the surface of the protein being replete\nwith positively charged lysine residues.\nThe authors thank EPSRC for financial support and EPSRC\nNational Mass Spectrometry Service Centre, Swansea for high\nresolution ESMS.\nJacqueline Hamblin, Neil Abboyi and Mark P.
