Our data clearly indicate that two different mechanisms are at work. At \nlow temperatures (T < 80 K), the zero-field PL is increasingly dominated by lower \nenergy dots. High-field measurements however demonstrate that these dots are larger \nin size only in the growth direction. At temperatures above 100 K, a strong decrease \nof the PL peak energy shift with field is observed, while the zero-field PL is \ncharacterized by a redshift according to the changes in the bandgap. We discuss these \ncontradictory observations in terms of a phenomenon that we call field-assisted \nenhancement of the QD barrier potential. Since this effect is much stronger for small \nhigh-energy QDs, the latter progressively dominate the PL emission when \ntemperature and magnetic field are increased.\n  2 \nSelf-assembled quantum dot (QD) semiconductor nanostructures are currently \nattracting substantial interest both for their fundamental properties and for \ntechnological applications.1-3 For devices like lasers, the occupancy of the discrete \natom-like energy levels4 of the QDs is ideally temperature (T) independent for \nT \u2264 300 K, but such ideal behavior is not observed in practice. Hence, a thorough \nunderstanding of the effect of temperature is essential for device fabrication. In this \nwork, we have performed nonresonant photoluminescence (PL) studies of InAs\/GaAs \nQDs as a function of temperature in high magnetic fields.5 Both the zero-field and \nhigh field experiments illustrate that two different temperature regimes can clearly be \ndistinguished. At low temperatures (T < 80 K), the zero-field PL energy shows a \nredshift with increasing temperature that is faster than predicted for the InAs band gap \nby the empirical Varshni law.6 Correspondingly, high field measurements confirm an \nenhanced transfer of carriers toward QDs that are larger in size in the growth direction \nz as the PL peak energy shift ( E\u0394 ) with magnetic field applied normal to the growth \ndirection exhibits a clear increase with increasing temperature. However, as there is \nno such trend for B \/\/ z, these low-energy dots are larger only in the growth direction \nand the exciton extent in the plane of the sample remains unchanged for T < 80 K. At \nhigher temperatures (T > 100 K) our results show that the zero-field PL energy \ndecreases according to the changes in the InAs band gap, with no sign of change in \nconfinement. The magneto-PL measurements however reveal a dramatic decrease of \nE\u0394  that is irrespective of the orientation of the applied magnetic field, implying a \nshrinkage of the exciton wave-function. We resolve this  apparent contradiction by \nnoting that the energy shift E\u0394  is measured in the presence of a very strong magnetic \nfield, and attribute the increased importance of small high-energy dots for the PL at \nhigh fields and temperatures to a field-induced increase of the QD barrier potential. \n  3 \nThe sample was prepared using solid-source molecular beam epitaxy. A 0.5 \u00b5m thick \nGaAs-layer was grown on top of a semi-insulating GaAs substrate. Subsequently, 1.8 \nmonolayers of InAs were deposited at a temperature of 480\u00b0C. During this phase, \nQDs were formed following the Stranski-Krastanow growth mode. Finally, the \nsample was capped with 25.2 nm of GaAs. The sample was excited by the light from \na solid-state laser at 532 nm via a 200 \u00b5m core optical fiber with a power density of 1 \n\u2013 10 Wcm-2. The sample itself was located in the bore of a home-made pulsed field \ncoil, placed in a He flow system allowing PL measurements over a broad temperature \nrange (4.2 \u2013 160 K). The coil was connected to a 5 kV 500 kJ capacitor bank, \nenabling magnetic field pulses of 20 ms and up to 50 T. The PL signal was collected \nby a single 550-\u00b5m core collection fiber and subsequently analyzed by a 30 cm \nmonochromator and a liquid nitrogen cooled InGaAs diode array, using count times \nup to 4 ms. The entire data set for the complete magnetic field range between 0 and \n50 T was then fitted using an excitonic model describing the dependence of the PL \nenergy on magnetic field,7 whose fitting parameters give access to the exciton \neffective mass \u03bc  and radius 1 22\u03c1 : \n \n2 2\n2\n0 2\n2\n0 2 2\n2                for \n8\n2       for \n22\ncm\ncm\ne\nE E B B\ne\neE E B B\ne\n\u03c1\n\u03bc \u03c1\n\u03bc\u03bc \u03c1 \u03c1\n= + <\n= \u2212 + >\nh\nh h h\n (1) \n \nwhere Ecm is the centre of mass PL energy, E0 is the zero-field PL energy and h  is the \nreduced Planck constant.  Through the combination of the parabolic (low fields) and \nlinear (high fields) behaviour of the PL shift into one equation, where the crossover \nfield is given by \n2\n2\ncB e \u03c1=\nh , we are able to extract both the effective exciton radius \n  4 \n1\/ 22\u03c1  and the reduced exciton mass \u00b5, two of the key parameters that govern the \nopto-electronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures. For the purposes of this \ninvestigation, we will concentrate on the shift in energy of the PL peak between 0 and \n50 T, E\u0394 , and the exciton radius, but not the exciton mass. \nThe inset of Fig. 1 shows the behaviour of the PL peak energy as a function of \ntemperature in the absence of a magnetic field. At low temperatures (T < 80 K) the \nredshift of the PL energy is faster than predicted6 for the InAs band gap. As discussed \npreviously by a number of groups8-10, this effect is attributed to thermal excitation of \ncarriers from small high-energy dots to large low-energy dots via the wetting layer. At \nhigher temperatures, the PL energy nicely follows the changes according to the \nVarshni law for the InAs bandgap. Following Brusaferri et al.,8 who reported \nevidence of families of dots with \u2018remarkably uniform sizes\u2019, we interpret this \ntemperature dependence of the PL energy as suggesting the presence of different dot \nfamilies with distinct sizes in our sample. \nIn order to gain further insight into the confinement of the carriers inside the dots, \nwe then studied the magneto-PL of the sample at different temperatures and with \ndifferent orientations of the field with respect to the growth direction. For the low \ntemperature regime, the shift is more or less constant with a magnetic field applied in \nthe growth direction, while experiments with B \u22a5  z reveal an increase of the shift \nwith temperature. When B \u22a5  z, we are probing the vertical extent of the exciton, \nsince this is the direction with the strongest confinement with this field orientation. \nBecause the exciton wave-function is so small in this direction, \u0394E is dominated by \nthe low field regime where it is proportional to 2\u03c1 \u03bc . An increase in \u0394E is thus \neither because \u03bc is decreasing or 1\/ 22\u03c1  is increasing (or both). However, if it were \n  5 \nonly because \u03bc was decreasing this would also increase the confinement energy, and \nresult in an increase of the zero-field PL energy relative to the change expected from \nthe Varshni law, which is the opposite of what we observe. On the other hand, a \ndecrease in the zero-field PL energy is entirely consistent with an enhanced transfer of \ncarriers towards larger QDs leading to a decrease in confinement. Hence, the increase \nin E\u0394  with the magnetic field perpendicular to the growth direction indicates an \nexpansion of the exciton wave-function in the growth direction reflecting the \nincreased contribution of larger QDs to the PL emission. In contrast, the energy shift \nwith magnetic field parallel to the growth direction remains unaltered at temperatures \nbelow 80 K. Thus, the explanation of the data in the inset of Fig. 1 that there is \nthermal excitation from smaller to bigger dots is indeed supported by our magneto-PL \nmeasurements, but the magneto-PL data crucially reveal that these dots are larger in \nsize only in the growth direction: there is no indication of a change in the average \nlateral size of the ensemble of dots in this temperature range.  \nWe now turn to the high temperature regime. Here, the field-induced PL shift is \ncharacterized by a massive decrease as a function of temperature irrespective of the B \norientation (Fig 2.). Applying an analysis to the data following the magnetic field \ndependence of the peak energy as described in Eq. (1) would lead us to interpret this \nas a shrinkage of the exciton radius (or, equivalently, an increase in confinement) as a \nresult of increasing temperature (inset of Fig. 2). However, if the QDs active at higher \ntemperatures were, on average, smaller than the ones responsible for the PL at low \ntemperatures, their confinement energy should be higher, as would be the \ncorresponding transition energies within the QD. In this case, the zero-field PL energy \nwould not follow the empirical Varshni law for the InAs bandgap, but show a weaker \ntemperature dependence or even an increase as a function of temperature, i.e. the \n  6 \nexact opposite of what we observe at low T. However, this is clearly not the case, and \nwe therefore conclude that the decrease of the field-induced PL shift with temperature \nis not due to a decrease of the (zero-field) exciton radius as a function of temperature, \nbut that it has some other cause. \nThe contradiction is resolved when noting that the energy shift is determined in \nthe presence of a very strong magnetic field, which, we propose, affects the \nconfinement potentials. In general, applying a magnetic field causes the energy levels \nof bulk GaAs (the barrier material) to be lifted by 1\n2 c\n\u03c9h , or about 0.9 meVT-1. In \ncontrast, the PL energy shift between 0 and 50 T of the InAs QDs with B \/\/ z for the \nconsidered temperature range, varies between 10 and 20 meV (see Fig. 2), resulting in \nan energy shift of about 0.2 to 0.4 meVT-1. Fig. 3 shows a schematic representation of \nthe electron energy levels of an InAs QD in the GaAs matrix, and illustrates the fact \nthat the application of a strong magnetic field increases the energy gap between the \nstates in the QDs and the states of the surrounding bulk GaAs material. When \napplying a magnetic field, the energy levels of the GaAs barrier material are \nsubstantially raised, while the increase of the QD levels is rather moderate. \nConsequently, a strong magnetic field enhances the temperature stability of the \nsystem by counteracting the escape of carriers from the dots into the surrounding \nbarrier material. However, the influence of a magnetic field on the energy levels of \nthe QDs is strongly dependent on the degree of confinement present in the dots. \nSmaller dots have a stronger confinement potential, resulting in a weaker dependence \non magnetic field. Therefore, the energy levels of the excitons with strong lateral \nconfinement, i.e. those with a weak energy shift in magnetic field (~ 0.2 meVT\u20131), are \nlifted much less than the ones with a weak lateral confinement, as the latter have a \nlarger PL shift in field (~ 0.4 meVT\u20131). In both cases, however, the barrier energy is \n  7 \nraised by the same larger amount. This results in a field-induced enhancement of 0.7 \nto 0.5 meVT-1 of the QD barrier potential. Correspondingly, the extra energy \ndifference between the QD levels and the GaAs barrier material at 50 T is 35 meV \n(400 K) for the high energy dots (i.e. the ones with strong lateral confinement), while \nit is only 25 meV (290 K) for the low energy dots (i.e. with weaker lateral \nconfinement). In other words, the effect of the magnetic field is to deepen the \nconfinement potentials of the QDs, and counter-intuitively, the mechanism is much \nstronger for smaller, high energy dots, as the energy levels of these dots are the least \naffected by a magnetic field. The result is that at high temperatures and high magnetic \nfields the contribution of the high energy dots to the PL relative to the low energy dots \nis increased, which in turn results in a smaller PL shift in magnetic field. \nIn conclusion, we have studied exciton confinement in self-assembled InAs\/GaAs \nQDs. At low temperatures (T < 80 K), we find that there is thermal excitation via the \nwetting layer to dots which are larger only in the growth direction. At higher \ntemperatures (T > 100 K) we observe a strong decrease of the PL shift in field, which \nwe attribute to field enhancement of the QD barrier potential. As the influence of a \nmagnetic field on the energy levels of the QDs depends inversely on the confinement \nenergy, this mechanism is particularly important for smaller dots. \n \n \nThis work was supported by the Belgian IAP, the SANDiE Network of Excellence \n(NMP4-CT-2004-500101), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n(United Kingdom), a Royal Society International Joint Project and the EuroMagNET \nproject (contract no.
