Using a principal-agent\nperspective as a starting point, the article examines why a double delegation\nto networks of regulators has taken place. It looks at how and why the\nEuropean Commission, national governments and independent regulatory\nagencies have driven the creation of networks, their institutional character\nand their implications for regulatory governance in Europe. It argues that\nproblems of co-ordination were the main factor advanced to justify\nestablishing networks of regulators. The new networks have been given a\nwide range of tasks and broad membership, but enjoy few formal powers or\nresources. They are highly dependent on the European Commission and\nface rivals for the task of co-ordinating European regulators.

A key element\nwas two parallel delegations of powers by national governments to\nsupranational bodies such as the European Union (Pollock \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733; Majone\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735) and to domestic independent regulatory agencies (IRAs) (Radaelli\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734; Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732b, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737a; Majone \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739; Bartle \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735). However, as\npolicy makers at these two levels of regulatory governance attempted to\nharmonise European single market issues in the late \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s, pressure grew\nJnl Publ. Pol., \uf732\uf738, \uf731, \uf734\uf739\u2013\uf737\uf731 \u0001 \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf738 Cambridge University Press\ndoi:10.1017\/S0143814X08000779 Printed in the United Kingdom\nfor a further round of delegations of co-ordinatory functions to European\nregulatory networks (ERNs). Here the creation of ERNs required a double\ndelegation of powers and functions: one \u2018 upwards\u2019 from the newly created\nIRAs and a second \u2018 downwards\u2019 from the European Commission.\nThe changing patterns of delegation have been seen as part of a\nbroader move towards \u2018 network governance\u2019 in Europe (see Schout and\nJordan \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Sabel and Zeitlin \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737; Eberlein and Kerwer \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734; He\u00b4ritier\nand Lehmkuhl in this issue; Christiansen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731), itself linked to literature\non policy networks (see Marsh and Rhodes \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf732; Rhodes \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730; Sabatier\n\uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738) and recent work on new forms of \u2018 international market govern-\nance\u2019 (see Slaughter \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734; Coen and Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735). In the field of\nregulation, three key elements of network governance can be set out here.\nOne is the linkage of actors from different institutional levels \u2013 national,\nEU and international \u2013 and both the public and the private sector in a\nform of sectoral governance (see He\u00b4ritier and Lehmkuhl in this issue;\nPierre and Peters \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730). A second is a shift of power from previously\nwell-established levels to organisations or individuals whose main role is\nlinking and co-ordinating actors (Schout and Jordan \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Jordan,\nWurzel and Zito \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Peters \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738). A third element involves a change in\nthe mode of governance, away from hierarchy and towards consultation,\nnegotiation and soft law (Sabel and Zeitlin \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737; Hudson and Maher\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731; Eberlein and Grande \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734; Kaiser and Prange \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734). In the context\nof these governance discussions, ERNs have created much excitement,\nwith claims that they form part of moves towards \u2018 network governance\u2019\nin regulation (Eberlein \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733; Eberlein and Grande \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734).\nThis article examines why the European Commission, national gov-\nernments and independent regulatory agencies have accepted or indeed\ndriven the creation of these networks of regulators, their institutional\ncharacter and their implications for regulatory governance in Europe.\nTaking a principal-agent perspective as a starting point for the formal\nanalysis of powers and functions delegated by the European Commission\nand IRAs, the central argument is that the networks represent a new\nround of double delegations. They are designed to respond to the\nmultiplication of regulators and their uneven development by co-\nordinating implementation of regulation by member states. But, at the\nformal level, the new European networks of regulators remain highly\nconstrained by existing actors. In particular, the European Commission\nand national regulators maintain many controls over the networks, which\nlack resources and rights of initiative. Such shadows of government\npotentially limit the innovative scope of ERNs (He\u00b4ritier and Lehmkuhl,\nin this issue) and raise important questions about their ability to evolve\ninto strong regulatory bodies (Sabel and Zeitlin \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737). The weakness of\nthe networks and the controls of their principals help to explain why\n\uf735\uf730 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\ndouble delegation was agreed to by both national and EU actors: they\ntransferred only limited powers and retained many controls over ERNs.\nIt also suggests that, since their formal institutional position is weak, if the\nnetworks are to have an impact on regulatory governance in Europe,\nthey must either develop informal resources and influence after formal\ndelegation has taken place (Sabel and Zeitlin \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737; Coen and Doyle \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730)\nand\/or gain new powers through new delegations in order to evolve\ninto more powerful regulatory bodies (Majone \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Thatcher and\nCoen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf738). In formal terms, analysis of European regulatory networks\nshows that \u2018 network governance\u2019 remains very limited in EU economic\nregulation.\nThe article begins with traditional analyses of delegation in Europe\nand then sets out the principal-agent framework that will be applied by\nthe empirical work on ERNs. Thereafter it examines the pressures and\nproblems that led to the creation of ERNs, before using principal-agent\ntheory to chart the double delegation to ERNs and offering a systematic\nanalysis of their functions, powers, resources and rivals. The conclusion\nlinks the findings back to arguments about network governance in\nEurope, as well as pointing to further research that is needed given the\nlimits of the principal-agent framework. The article uses detailed case\nstudies of the two most powerful and well-established ERNs, since they\noffer the maximum degree of delegation: the European Regulators\nGroup for telecommunications and CESR (the Committee of European\nSecurities Regulators) for securities. Similar developments have been\nobserved in energy and data protection (Eberlein and Newman \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737), but\nthese are weaker ERNs than our two cases, which therefore offer a good\ntest for the position of such networks.\nThe logic of double delegation in European regulation\nEuropean regulation has been transformed by a series of delegations. At\nthe supranational level, European states have given the EU progressively\ngreater powers to extend its regulatory activities (Majone \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736;\nFranchino \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737). Using these powers, EU sectoral regulatory regimes\nhave grown in major markets previously largely immune from EU action,\nsuch as telecommunications, financial services, electricity, gas, railways,\npostal services and food safety (see Humphreys and Simpson \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735;\nBulmer et al. \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737). EU regimes involve detailed EU regulation, notably:\nliberalisation through ending the right of member states to maintain\n\u2018 special and exclusive rights\u2019 for certain suppliers; and \u2018 re-regulation\u2019, i.e.\nEU rules governing competition, ranging over a vast array of matters,\nsuch as interconnection of networks, access to infrastructure and univer-\nsal service. At the national level, governments have created new IRAs,\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf735\uf731\nboth sectoral bodies and general authorities, and\/or have strengthened\nexisting IRAs (Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732b, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737a; Coen and He\u00b4ritier \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Gilardi\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Levi-Faur \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734). IRAs are legally and organisationally\nseparated from government departments and suppliers, are headed by\nappointed members who cannot be easily dismissed before the end of\ntheir terms and have their own staff, budgets and internal organisational\nrules (Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735).\nIn such a context of delegation to both the EU and IRAs, from the late\n\uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s onwards a further set of double delegations has taken place to\nEuropean regulatory networks (ERNs). As will be described in greater\ndetail below, these networks straddle national and supranational levels of\nregulation, since they comprise national IRAs from all EU member\nstates, as well as the European Commission. Established through EU law\nthat gives them functions, they are hybrid bodies that link the EU and\nnational levels, and indeed bring together two sets of agents from\nprevious delegations, namely IRAs and the Commission. They are given\nthe task of co-ordinating regulators and increasing consistency of\nregulation across the EU. They appear to offer an important move\ntowards formal network governance, one that goes beyond pre-existing\ndelegations and\/or the reliance on soft law in informal European\nnetworks.\nHow can delegation in European governance, including to ERNs, be\nanalysed? One approach is to use principal-agent theories. These explain\ndelegation by elected politicians to non-majoritarian institutions in terms\nof the advantages gained by insulating IRAs from political pressures and\ntheir ability to perform functions for elected politicians (Thatcher\nand Stone Sweet \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732; Bendor, Glazer and Hammond \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731; Weingast\nand Moran \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf733).\uf732 Principal-agent theory has been applied to delegation\nto regulatory bodies in Europe (Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732b, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Pollack \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733;\nGilardi \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732; Majone \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736). It is argued that governments have delegated\nboth to IRAs nationally and to the EU to enhance credible commitment,\nespecially in sectors such as utilities, where governments seek outside\ninvestment or other long-term commitments but where other actors such\nas investors fear that governments will renege on promises (see Levy and\nSpiller \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf736). Another reason has been to shift blame for unpopular or\ndifficult decisions (Egan \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737). A third factor has been to increase\nefficiency, especially in domains that are complex and technical (Majone\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731). All of the above have at various times been used as rationales for\ndelegation to EU agencies (Pollack \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733; Franchino \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737) and have\nemerged to a greater or lesser extent in the recent debates surrounding\nERNs.\nHowever, principal-agent theory points out that delegation is a\nvariable. Principals choose the extent of delegation and which specific\n\uf735\uf732 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\npowers are given to their agents. Equally, they maintain controls over the\nagent, such as appointments, budgetary and staffing resources and the\nability to overturn agents\u2019 decisions. Indeed, principals will be highly\nconcerned to minimise \u2018 agency loss\u2019 (i.e. agents acting against the\npreferences of the principal) through \u2018 shirking\u2019 and \u2018 slippage\u2019. They will\nseek to design institutions to minimise such agency losses.\nIn light of the above, we see that principal-agent theory is a useful tool\nwith which to perform an initial analysis of the rise of ERNs for four\nreasons. Firstly, ERNs were created explicitly by IRAs and the European\nCommission. Principal-agent theory\u2019s interest-based approach directs us\nto examine why these actors have chosen to delegate and offers a range\nof possible reasons to explain delegation. Secondly, the EU\u2019s legalised\nnature means that delegation of powers requires a legal basis. Since the\nformal institutional position of ERNs is set out, including their powers\nand the controls over them, principal-agent analysis can be used to\nexamine their formal independence. Thirdly, application of principal-\nagent theory requires definition of principals and agents. Hence it\nnecessitates a careful study of who is delegating and who wields controls,\na central issue in a complex polity such as the EU, especially for ERNs,\nwhich are children of multiple parents (governments, IRAs and the\nEuropean Commission). Finally, the principal-agent framework under-\nlines the importance of institutional design since principals will be highly\nconcerned with post-delegation events and are expected to mould their\ninitial choices accordingly.\nBut principal-agent tools must be wielded with care, and the limita-\ntions of the approach understood in analysing delegation (see Coen and\nThatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735). In particular, it is based on a rational choice conception\nof institutions, which it presents as consciously and explicitly designed;\nhence it excludes non-rational strategies such as copying or the evolution\nof institutions (see McNamara \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732). Secondly, and closely linked, it\nfocuses on the formal structure of delegation, leaving aside informal\nresources and controls. Thirdly, it examines post-delegation behaviour\nthrough the rather narrow prism of formal principals and agents and\nagency loss. It omits other actors in the \u2018 regulatory space\u2019 who may be of\ngreat importance in the governance structures of the ERNs (Scott \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730)\nand may fail to allow for the fact that delegating actors are also active\nmembers of the newly created bodies. It also downplays post-delegation\nbehaviour that may alter the original delegation (Coen and Thatcher\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735). One example of such behaviour is the alteration of formal\ndelegation driven by endogenous factors such as learning or the\ndevelopment of expertise, or exogenous factors such as technological\nand economic developments or external coercion (Sabel and Zeitlin\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737). Finally, formal institutions are overlaid with informal linkages,\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf735\uf733\nsuch as policy or epistemic communities\/networks. These may modify\nbehaviour within a given formal institutional framework, due to factors\nsuch as learning or new resources, representing a form of renegotiation\nof the original \u2018 contract\u2019 or formal delegation (Coen and He\u00b4ritier\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735).\nAll of the above caveats are important if we are to understand the\npost-delegation phase of the ERNs and potential evolutionary trajectories\nof new market governance. Hence principal-agent analyses can offer a\nstarting point, not an end point, for analysis. However, it is difficult to\nanalyse post-delegation factors such as learning or the impact of\nexogenous changes without a sound understanding of the initial delega-\ntion. Equally, policy communities or networks operate within formal\ninstitutional frameworks or under the \u2018 shadow of hierarchy\u2019 that sets the\nallocation of powers and sanctions (He\u00b4ritier and Lehmkuhl, in this issue).\nThus, understanding developments in delegation involves starting with\nthe reasons for institutional changes and the formal framework that is put\nin place.\nThe spread of regulatory networks in Europe\nEU regulation is implemented at the national level, not by the European\nCommission which has low numbers of staff and little in the way of\nfinancial resources.\uf733 National regulatory authorities (NRAs) are respon-\nsible for implementing EU legislation at the national level. NRAs can be\ngovernments or independent sectoral regulators (the IRAs). Since much\nregulation concerning liberalisation and re-regulation is based on EU\nlegislation (albeit transposed into national law), NRAs in practice end up\nimplementing and interpreting much EU regulation.\nHowever, EU regulation has said relatively little about the institutional\nframework for the implementation of regulation within member states.\nIt has not insisted that NRAs be IRAs and hence independent of\ngovernment, nor has it laid down rules for the institutional form or\npowers of NRAs. Instead, it has confined itself to insisting that regulatory\norganisations be separate from suppliers, that they follow certain\ndecision-making principles such as \u2018 fairness\u2019 and transparency and that\nthey have adequate resources to fulfil their EU-created legal duties.\nThis initial European regulatory regime contained two batches of\ndelegation. One involved national governments delegating responsibili-\nties to the EU which then delegated implementation to NRAs, notably\nIRAs. The other involved national governments delegating to IRAs\n(Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732b). However, IRAs now have two sources of delegated\ntasks \u2013 both from the EU, since they are NRAs responsible for\nimplementing EU legislation, and from national governments \u2013 and\n\uf735\uf734 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\nhence two principals (of Egeberg \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736). Principal-agent analysis under-\nlines that this situation could create problems for these two principals in\ncontrolling their common agent (IRAs). Since it emphasises the impor-\ntance of institutional design for IRA behaviour, it also points to the likely\ncross-national differences in implementation arising from the lack of EU\nregulation on the institutional form of NRAs.\nIndeed, the evidence points to the existence of such difficulties.\nCo-ordination of different national regulators in implementing EU\nregulation was encouraged via informal agreements and working groups\nat the EU level, but the Commission struggled to establish regulatory\nnorms and best practice. Moreover, IRAs differed in terms of their age,\npowers, autonomy, finances and staffing (Coen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735;\nCoen and He\u00b4ritier \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735; Bo\u00a8llhoff \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735), as their institutional design and\ncreation varied from one country to another. In fact, after twenty years\nof deregulation and liberalisation, we still observe diverse regulatory\nprinciples and different relationships between IRAs, elected politicians\nand suppliers (Thatcher \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732a \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737b). Implementation of all public\npolicies faces problems of agency loss, as IRAs and governments putting\npolicies into practice enjoy discretion and the ability to alter a policy\u2019s\noriginal aims, but these features were magnified in the case of the EU,\nbecause legislation is broad and EU directives are binding on member\nstates as to their aims but not the means of achieving them. In addition,\nthe Commission\u2019s limited resources make oversight of IRAs difficult,\nindeed largely ruling out any \u2018 police patrol\u2019 strategy (McCubbins and\nSchwartz \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf734).\nGiven difficulties in implementing EU regulation, calls were made in\nthe \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s for independent \u2018 Euro-regulators\u2019 \u2013 i.e. EU-level bodies insu-\nlated from member states and separate from the Commission (Majone\n\uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731; Dehousse \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737). While arguments based on co-ordinating the\nEuropean single market, international competitiveness and increasing\nintegration encouraged many economists to call for a single European\nregulator, the political reality meant that it was unlikely to occur. Firstly\nand most importantly, national governments were reluctant to create\nsuch a body, even in telecommunications, the sector with the most\nadvanced \u2018 partnership\u2019 between member states and the European\nCommission. Their opposition was firmly rooted in questions of sover-\neignty and control of political economy issues such as universal service\nand national champions. However, equally significant was the unwilling-\nness on the part of politicians to open up the single market and\nMaastricht treaties \u2013 with the very real risk of the treaties unravelling.\nFinally, on the practical side, and at a time of smaller government and\nworries about the creeping competences of the European Commission,\nmember states were unwilling to fund and staff an EU regulator. Running\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf735\uf735\nparallel with this lack of \u2018 political will\u2019 was the fear of most suppliers\nabout the remoteness of a Euro-regulator and about losing a local IRA\n(Coen and He\u00b4ritier \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730). Equally, the Commission was concerned about\na transfer of powers to a Euro-regulator, and the powers that it could\ndelegate were limited by the legal doctrine of \u2018 non-delegation\u2019 (the\n\u2018 Meroni Doctrine\u2019; see Majone \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736).\nAs an alternative to Euro-regulators and in line with broader moves\nto encourage \u2018 the open method of co-ordination\u2019 and subsidiarity (see\nEuropean Commission \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731b), European regulatory co-ordination has\nbeen encouraged and fostered through the formation of formal and\ninformal horizontal networks of regulators (Coen and Doyle \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730;\nEberlein and Newman \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737). Initially, these involved informal fora of\nsectoral public and private actors, who met infrequently and had no\nformal powers or organisation. Examples include the European Electricity\nRegulation Forum (the Florence Forum, started \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf738), and one year later\nthe European Gas Regulation Forum (the Madrid Forum) (see Eberlein\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735). Thereafter, informal groups of national IRAs (NIRAs) were\nestablished, such as the Independent Regulators Group (IRG) for tele-\ncommunications in \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737, FESCO (the Forum of European Securities\nCommissions \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737) and the CEER (Council of European Energy Regula-\ntors \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730). Both types of network were groups set up by national IRAs\nthrough memoranda of understanding; they lacked legal powers or\nfunctions. They were added to highly intergovernmental bodies such as\nthe CEPT (Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications\nAdministrations), established in \uf731\uf739\uf735\uf739, whose membership goes beyond\nthat of the EU.\nHowever, the early \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730s saw further moves that involved greater\nformalisation of networks and a further set of delegations through the\nestablishment of ERNs. The ERNs are considerably more formalised and\ninvolve greater delegation than the other networks (many of which\ncontinue to exist alongside them).\uf734 They were set up by EU legislation\n(usually decisions) in key sectors such as telecommunications, financial\nservices and energy. Their legal basis sets out their functions, composition\nand powers. They are composed of public officials from member states,\nin contrast to the fora. Equally, the Commission has a significant role,\nwith rights to attend meetings, unlike groups of NIRAs such as the IRG\nand CEER. They are given tasks of co-ordinating national regulatory\nauthorities through functions such as providing \u2018 technical\u2019 advice to the\nCommission, consulting the industry monitoring compliance with EU\nregulation, and establishing norms and benchmarks, which are forms\nof soft law. However, in pushing for the creation of the ERN, the\nCommission, under pressure from the IRAs and the European Parlia-\nment, made a number of important concessions on its right of veto over\n\uf735\uf736 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\nthe decisions of IRAs concerning regulatory harmonisation remedies\n(Coen and Doyle \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730).\nFigure \uf731 summarises major networks in a \u2018 hard\u2019 to \u2018 soft\u2019 continuum,\nwhere \u2018 hard\u2019 refers to greater powers and formalisation of position. As\ncan be seen, ERNs represent a considerable move away from inter-\ngovernmental bodies such as the CEPT. Moreover, in the past ten years\nseveral ERNs were created; Table \uf731 summarises the key developments.\nIt should be noted that there are continuing debates about the\nevolution of institutions for regulatory co-ordination (see Thatcher and\nCoen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf738). In particular, in attempting to co-ordinate the single market,\nERNs have found themselves caught between the objectives of their two\nprincipals. At the European level we have the Commission pushing for\ngreater consistency of interpretation, greater harmonisation and more\nmonitoring of regulatory activity proposals.\uf735 Conversely, the IRAs, while\nrecognising the benefits of regulatory convergence and best practice\nwithin the single market, have tended to look to their domestic constitu-\nencies and have in the past sought to limit their involvement in the\nERNs.\uf736 The above tension illustrates the risks involve in this double\nF\uf769\uf767\uf775\uf772\uf765 \uf731.

As a result, discussions of Euro-regulators or\nstrengthened ERNs have been revived in sectors such as telecommuni-\ncations and energy.\uf737 Thus, for instance, Information Commissioner\nVivien Reding stated that: \u2018 For me it is clear that the most effective and\nleast bureaucratic way to achieve a real level playing field for telecom\noperators across the EU would . . . be by an independent European\ntelecom authority\u2019 (Financial Times, \uf731\uf736 November \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736). Equally, the\nCommission in its December \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736 green paper on energy (European\nCommission \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736) put forward the idea of a Euro-regulator in the\ncontext of increasing fears over energy security and a desire to promote\ncross-border links and competition.\nWhile justification for the creation of Euro-regulators continues to\nfocus on regulatory efficiency and greater top-down co-ordination, many\nreal political and economic barriers to their creation continue to exist.\nUnder such conditions the strengthening and altering of the ERNs\u2019\nfunctions and powers remains a credible governance alternative and\nneeds to be better understood. Thus, the focus in this paper is on ERNs\nand the two most established and most important, CESR and the ERG.\nLooking at these two bodies in detail helps us explain who delegated\nto ERNs and why, and their significance for changes in European\nregulatory governance.\nERNs in telecommunications and securities: the establishment of CESR and the\nERG\nCESR arose directly from the Lamfalussy commission, which was set up\nby the European Commission and national governments to aid the\ncreation of the single market in financial services and notably for the \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739\nFinancial Services Action Plan (European Commission \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739b). The\ninitial report suggested the creation of a \u2018 regulators\u2019 group\u2019, which was\nmore palatable for respondents to the Lamfalussy consultation than a\nEuropean securities regulator. The Lamfalussy report noted the draw-\nbacks of the existing regulators\u2019 committee, FESCO, which had no\nofficial status, worked by consensus, and had non-binding recommenda-\ntions. Interestingly, FESCO itself advocated the creation of a more\nformal regulators\u2019 committee that could be involved in the legislative\nprocess, offering evidence that national IRAs were in favour of CESR\n(FESCO \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730: \uf731\uf736). The final Lamfalussy report proposed the establish-\nment of CESR, which would both act as an advisory committee to the\nEuropean Commission and aid in bringing together IRAs and prac-\ntitioners to ensure more consistent implementation of Community law.\nThe decision to establish a new body was taken by all the EU\ninstitutions. Thus, an ECOFIN Council communication of November\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf735\uf739\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730 confirmed its support for the creation of a regulators\u2019 body, but also\nasked it to perform a role when particularly sensitive issues were\nconcerned (ECOFIN Council \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731: Annex \uf731, \uf734\uf733). A European Council\nPresidency communication of December \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf730 also supported the crea-\ntion of a regulators\u2019 body as a part of the Lamfalussy process, although\nit noted that harmonisation of national regulatory functions would be a\ndesirable prerequisite (Ibid: \uf734\uf734). The European Parliament was con-\ncerned about inadequate supervision of delegated legislation comitology\nprocedures (European Parliament \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731), but did not attempt to block the\nestablishment of CESR. CESR was then set up as \u2018 an independent\nadvisory group on securities in the Community\u2019 by a Commission\ndecision in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731 (European Commission \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731a).\nMany parallels can be found between the creation of CESR and that\nof the ERG. During the \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf730s, several proposals were made for a\nEuropean telecoms regulator, including one by the Commission. Firms\nwere divided: newer operators hoped for the creation of a single\nregulator, but existing suppliers were concerned that centralisation of\nregulation across the EU might damage their commercial prospects. But\nideas of a Euro-regulator were rejected by member states.\nInstead, the Commission turned to the idea of a less prominent and\npowerful body. The genesis of the ERG lay in the Commission\u2019s \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739\nCommunications Review, which looked at updating and unifying the\nvarious pieces of EU legislation in telecommunications that had accrued\nover the previous fifteen years. A Commission communication (European\nCommission \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739a) of November \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739 mooted the idea of increased\nco-ordination of NRAs\u2019 decisions at European Union level. It claimed\nthat stronger EU-wide co-ordination was necessary since the NRAs\nwould be delegated more power by the new regulatory framework. The\ncommunication also noted that existing procedures for co-operation with\nthe CEPT had not worked satisfactorily. The CEPT was an existing\norganisation run through consensus and in an intergovernmental man-\nner: that is, without binding powers on its national members, and often\nconcerned with standard setting rather than liberalisation and regulation\nof competition. Initially, a High-Level Communications Group involving\nthe Commission and NRAs was established under the telecommuni-\ncations Framework Directive (European Parliament and Council \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732) to\nhelp improve the consistent application of Community legislation and\nmaximise the uniform application of national measures. However, a short\nCommission decision soon replaced it with a European regulators group\nfor electronic communications networks and services in July \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732\n(European Commission \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732: \uf733\uf738).\nThe history of CESR and the ERG underlines the earlier general\npoints made about ERNs. Firstly, their establishment was closely linked\n\uf736\uf730 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\nto implementing EU regulation. They flowed from perceived difficulties\nof introducing the single market at the national level and co-ordinating\na host of diverse NRAs. Secondly, ERNs followed the rejection of ideas\nof Euro regulators. They represented a response to co-ordination\nproblems \u2013 i.e. delegation to increase efficiency \u2013 without creating a new\nsupranational body. Thirdly, they were proposed by the Commission or\nCommission-created bodies, accepted by national governments and\nIRAs, then set up formally by Commission decision. They are the fruit of\nan agreement between several actors.\nThe institutional design of ERNs: composition, functions, powers, resources and\nrivals\nCESR and the ERG appear to provide a good example of a movement\ntowards network governance. However, analysis of the institutional\ndesign reveals the weaknesses of the new ERNs and the strength of their\nprincipals, namely the European Commission and national governments\nand regulators. The membership of CESR and the ERG is wide and\nambiguous, making autonomous action difficult. The two ERNs are\ngiven very broad functions but few powers. Their resources are limited\nand they face rival venues both for co-ordination and for more traditional\ngovernmental functions of deciding through hierarchy and hard law. A\ndetailed analysis of the institutional design thus reveals limited delega-\ntion, many controls and an institutional context that allows policymakers\nto work through alternative organisations.\nComposition of ERNs\nThe membership of ERNs is composed of formal representatives from\nmember state NRAs. It differs considerably from informal networks such\nas the Florence and Madrid fora, which involve private and public actors,\nincluding experts and regulatees. The Commission has an important\nposition but its role is ambiguous, something between a full member and\nan external \u2018 overseer\u2019. Here, we focus on the ERG and CESR.\nThe ERG consists of representatives of IRAs from the twenty-five EU\nmember States. However, eligibility soon posed difficulties with respect to\nthe degree of independence required for membership. The original \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732\ndecision stated that the ERG \u2018 shall be composed of the heads of each\nrelevant national regulatory authority in each Member State or their\nRepresentatives\u2019 (European Commission \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732: Art. \uf734) but also that it\nshould be a \u2018 group of independent national regulatory Authorities\u2019 (Ibid:\nArt. \uf731). The preamble made reference to ensuring sufficient separation\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf736\uf731\nfrom suppliers, especially if a member state had publicly owned suppli-\ners.\uf738 This raised important issues of whether an IRA was sufficiently\nindependent from publicly owned suppliers. The ambiguity was ended, at\nleast in formal terms, by a new decision in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734 (European Commission\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf734) that simply stated that eligible IRAs would be listed in an annex\nand kept under review by the Commission. Nevertheless, this decision\nallowed the Commission considerable scope for further intervention to\ndecide the ERG\u2019s membership.\nThe ERG also has observers from EU accession\/candidate states and\nEuropean Economic Area states. In \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735, the ERG granted observer\nstatus to Turkey and Croatia as EU accession countries. In addition, the\nCommission sits as an observer at the ERG. Its representatives are able\nto remain in the ERG while confidential issues are discussed. Although\nthe Commission is represented on the ERG, it also works \u2018 jointly\u2019 with\nthe latter, as for example when they issued a joint paper on anti-\nmonopoly remedies. So the Commission appears to be both a partner\nwith the ERG and a quasi-member, as well as being one of its formal\nprincipals.\nCESR is composed of one senior member from each member state\u2019s\ncompetent authority in the securities field, with EEA representatives as\nobservers. The identification of \u2018 competent authorities\u2019 with the requisite\ndegree of independence was a problem for CESR as it was for the ERG.\nIn \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732, countries such as France, Finland and Ireland all lacked a single\nNRA for the entire financial sector, with responsibilities being split\nbetween different bodies (CESR \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732b: \uf738). The Commission is an\nobserver at CESR, but \u2018 it shall be present at meetings of the Committee\nand shall designate a high-level representative to participate in all its\ndebates\u2019, except when the Committee discusses confidential matters\nrelating to individuals and firms in the context of improving co-operation\namong European Regulators (CESR \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732a: Art. \uf733.\uf731).\nFunctions and powers of ERNs\nThe functions given to ERNs are very broad and strongly linked to the\nCommission, at least according to the EU decisions that create them.\nThus, for instance, the Commission decision establishing CESR defined\nits role as \u2018 to advise the Commission, either at the Commission\u2019s request,\nwithin a time limit which the Commission may lay down according to the\nurgency of the matter, or on the Committee\u2019s own initiative, in particular\nfor the preparation of draft implementing measures in the field of\nsecurities\u2019 (European Commission \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731a: Art. \uf732). More specifically,\nCESR was required to consult extensively with market participants,\nconsumers and end-users, and to present an annual report to the\n\uf736\uf732 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\nCommission, which would also be sent to the Parliament and Council.\nThis role was expanded in CESR\u2019s Charter to cover other tasks such as\nreviewing the implementation and application of Community legislation,\nthe issuing of guidelines, recommendations and standards for its mem-\nbers to introduce in their regulatory practices on a voluntary basis, and\nthe development of effective operational network mechanisms to enhance\nconsistent day-to-day supervision and enforcement of the single market\nfor financial services.\nCESR was given roles within EU legislation on financial services. The\nLamfalussy process sets out a four-level procedure which moves from the\ndefinition of the overarching regulatory framework through to its\nenforcement. The first level follows standard EU procedure, with the\nCommission making legislative proposals, based on stakeholder consul-\ntation, which are subsequently adopted through the co-decision process\nby the Council and European Parliament. This stage also sets out\nthe implementation powers of the Commission. Level \uf732 concerns the\nadoption of implementing legislation laying down technical details for the\nframework principles agreed at level \uf731. Here, the comitology procedure\nis used, with votes being taken by qualified majority at the European\nSecurities Committee (ESC). The European Parliament is also consulted\non the draft implementing measures and is given one month to pass a\nresolution on the final legislation where it considers the Commission to\nhave exceeded its implementation powers. Level \uf733 focuses on the\nconsistent implementation of Community legislation across the member\nstates. Here, comparisons of national regulatory practices are made and\nrecommendations for common standards are proposed. The final level\nconcerns the monitoring of compliance of member state laws with\nCommunity legislation. Where necessary, the Commission can pursue\nlegal action through the European Court of Justice in cases where\ncompliance is lacking.\nCESR\u2019s involvement in this process relates specifically to the second\nand third levels. But its roles are mainly to provide advice and help to\nestablish non-binding norms, a form of soft law. Moreover, its position is\nheavily dependent on other actors in the policy process. Thus, although\nCESR has been given a mandate by the Commission to prepare technical\nadvice in the form of implementing measures, which it does based on its\nown formal consultation procedure, level \uf732 legislation is adopted through\nformal EU comitology procedures. These involve the ESC, consisting of\nrepresentatives from member states, acting through EU legal procedures.\nAt level \uf733, CESR is responsible for leading the co-ordination activities.\nIt can issue non-binding common guidelines and standards aimed at\nfacilitating the interpretation and facilitation of Community legislation.\nIt addition, it can conduct benchmarking exercises aimed at gauging\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf736\uf733\nmember state compliance with such standards. This is, in many ways, an\nactivity that is complementary to the Commission\u2019s compliance tests at\nlevel \uf734, though it is \u2018 softer\u2019. It underlines that CESR can have influence\nthrough the creation of norms or soft law. But, overall, while CESR has\nbeen given a clear mandate within the Lamfalussy legislative process, it\ncan shape directives at level \uf732 only in so far as it can influence the\nCommission, and it risks being constrained by the European Securities\nCommittee. Thus, CESR\u2019s major roles are advisory and involve co-\nordination of implementation of Community regulation.\nSimilarly, the role of the ERG is to \u2018 advise and assist the Commission\nin consolidating the internal market for electronic communications\nnetworks and services\u2019, and to \u2018 provide an interface between national\nregulatory authorities and the Commission\u2019 (European Commission\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732: Art. \uf733). It too was asked to \u2018 consult extensively and at an early stage\nwith market participants, consumers and end-users in an open and\ntransparent manner\u2019 (Ibid: Art. \uf736). However, its mandate is even less wide\nthan CESR\u2019s in relation to the definition of implementing measures,\nas there is no well-specified equivalent to the Lamfalussy process for\ntelecommunications legislation.\nThe powers of ERNs are often limited. Thus, for instance, ERG\ndecisions are not binding on its members. Even deciding its own rules of\nprocedure require considerable agreement among member states and it\nis dependent on the Commission: these are to be adopted by consensus\nor, in the absence of consensus, by a two-thirds\u2019 majority vote, one vote\nper member state, subject to the approval of the Commission (Ibid: Art.\n\uf735). CESR enjoys marginally greater powers over its own internal\nfunctioning in that the decision creating it allowed to adopt its own rules\nof procedure and organise its own operational arrangements. Neverthe-\nless, the Committee has advocated that CESR use a voting procedure\nmodelled on qualified majority voting where it was not possible to reach\nconsensus, and this has been adopted in CESR\u2019s operations.\nThus, ERNs face ambitious aims and are asked to consult widely and\ncover broad fields. Yet they lack formal powers to impose decisions on\ntheir members and indeed even to organise their own internal\narrangements.\nResources of ERNs\nThe material resources of ERNs are decided by their members and the\nEuropean Commission. ERNs are small organisations in terms of staffing\nand spending. Thus, for instance, the CESR secretariat, based in Paris,\nstarted with seven members of staff plus a secretary general, although this\nhad grown to fifteen by \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735. It also has a small budget, which led to\n\uf736\uf734 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\ncomments from Baron Lamfalussy that CESR lacked sufficient staff to\nmake sure that the new regulatory framework worked properly (Financial\nTimes, \uf731\uf733 March \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732). In \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732\u2013\uf733, the budget for CESR was increased by\na third, apparently due to a willingness by members to contribute more;\nby \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735 it spent \uf732.\uf734m euros (CESR \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735: \uf737\uf737). The ERG has even fewer\nresources of its own: the Commission provided its staff, which appeared\nto number three persons in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733, while from \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736 the ERG secretariat\nfunctions are integrated into the services of the Directorate General for\nInformation Society and Media (ERG \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733, \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735). Hence ERNs are\nsmall even relative to the Commission, let alone in comparison to\nnational IRAs and especially regulated firms.\nAlternative decision-making venues\nERNs face several rivals for the functions of decisionmaking, even at the\nEU level. The most important are the formally established EU commit-\ntees. Thus, for instance, in securities, the ESC has significant powers over\nEU legislation. Like CESR, it was set up by a Commission Decision\n(European Commission \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731c) after lengthy discussions involving\nnational governments and the European Parliament. It is composed\nof representative of EU member states, thereby integrating national\ngovernments. It acts as an advisory committee to the Commission on\nboth policy issues and draft legislation; this mandate is considerably more\nprecise than CESR\u2019s broad and undefined advisory function. In addition,\nin level \uf732 of the Lamfalussy procedures, when broad directives are being\nproposed by the Commission, it acts as a normal EU committee, that is,\none that operates under the comitology procedure and whose approval is\nneeded for Commission proposals to be passed without going to the full\ncouncil of ministers (see Varone et al. \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736). Thus, the ESC\u2019s procedures\nform part of well-established EU comitology, and it has legal powers over\nlegislation.\nA similar situation exists in telecommunications, with the existence of\nthe Communications Committee (Cocom), also set up by Commission\ndecision (European Parliament and Council \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf732). It is composed of\nrepresentatives of member states and acts both as an advisory committee\nand a regulatory committee in accordance with general comitology\nprocedures. In addition, it provides a platform for the exchange of\ninformation on market developments and regulatory activities.\nCESR and the ERG also contend with well-established European and\ninternational organisations that operate through intergovernmental\nprocesses, notably consensus and the absence of powers to impose\ndecisions on members. In telecommunications, there is the CEPT,\ncreated in \uf731\uf739\uf735\uf739, extending beyond the EU to all European states. It has\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf736\uf735\nplayed an important role in standard setting as well as bringing together\nrepresentatives from national administrations and, traditionally, opera-\ntors. Then there is the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),\nwhich has members across the world. In securities trading, there is also\nthe International Organization for Securities Commissions (IOSCO),\nfounded in \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf734, which is composed of securities regulators from around\nthe world and seeks to set international standards, notably via MOUs\n(memoranda of understanding). Its members cover more than \uf739\uf730 per cent\nof the world\u2019s securities markets and include the United States.\nFinally, there are rival informal networks of regulators whose existence\nmay result in institutional competition and venue shopping by those\nregulatees that can operate in a multilevel policy process. In particular,\nin telecommunications, the Independent Regulators\u2019 Group, established\nin \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf737 as a group of European national telecommunications regulatory\nauthorities, continues to exist alongside the ERG. It has the advantage\n(for IRAs) that the Commission is not a member and that it is run by\nIRAs themselves. Its mere presence raises questions over the level of\nconfidence in the independence of the ERG with which it competes.\nSimilarly, CESR\u2019s power (specifically at level \uf732) is constrained by the\nESC, which is legally responsible for passing delegated legislation that\ndetails broad level \uf731 directives. In electricity and gas, the Florence and\nMadrid Fora include private sector participants, although the Commis-\nsion is also closely involved. Moreover, the role of the CEER may\npotentially be eclipsed by the European Regulators Group for Energy\nand Gas (ERGEG).\nThus, national governments, IRAs and the European Commission all\nhave venues for co-ordination that are alternatives to CESR and the\nERG. The two networks are in competition for resources, attention and\npower with other networks or committees that have their own distinct\ninstitutional advantages, such as greater formal powers or the ability to\nwork without the Commission.\nConclusion\nERNs have been established in economically and politically strategic\ndomains, notably network sectors. Using a principal-agent framework,\nthe reasons both for the decision to double delegate and for the institutional\ndesign of the delegation have been analysed. Delegation was undertaken\nby the Commission and IRAs, but after extensive discussions with the\nmember states and European Parliament. It was justified by the need for\ngreater co-ordination in implementing EU regulation: i.e. by greater\nefficiency. However, the creation of ERNs took place only after another\nsolution, the creation of Euro-regulators, had been rejected. Whether\n\uf736\uf736 David Coen and Mark Thatcher\nERNs can indeed be seen as a \u2018 second best\u2019 method of dealing with\nimplementation of EU regulation or as a stable point in institutional\nregulatory design is a still a moot point (see Thatcher and Coen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf738).\nThey certainly appear to be a compromise between actors pressing for\ngreater European integration and those fearing it, especially national\ngovernments.\nThe institutional design of ERNs reflects their genesis. They have been\ngiven lofty tasks, but few powers and resources. The European Commis-\nsion and national actors (governments and IRAs) maintain many powers\nover ERNs. In addition, the existence of several other regulatory\nnetworks and organisations creates rivals to ERNs. This limited mandate\nand competitive institutional relationship have created conflict between\nthe aims and the capacities of ERNs.\nWhat are the implications of these findings for wider claims of the\ndevelopment of network governance in Europe? The introduction set out\nthree features of network governance: it offers, firstly, a form of sectoral\ngovernance; secondly, a shift of power from previously well-established\nlevels to organisations or individuals whose main role is linking actors;\nand, thirdly, changes in the mode of governance, away from hierarchy\ntowards more \u2018 horizontal\u2019 and co-operative forms of decisionmaking.\nOur empirical findings can be set against these three key features. In\nthe first instance, the analysis suggests that, in formal institutional terms,\nERNs bring together national IRAs and the European Commission. But\nthey do not bind together sectoral actors from private and public sectors:\nalthough ERNs are required to consult private actors, those actors are\nnot full members. Moreover, the ERNs\u2019 lack of powers to impose\ndecisions on national IRAs and their small size and reliance on the\nEuropean Commission (going so far as providing the secretariat for the\nERG) suggest that ERNs are far from offering \u2018 sectoral governance\u2019.\nWith respect to the second feature, few powers have been delegated to\nERNs. Even worse (for claims of the spread of network governance),\nexisting organisations \u2013 notably the European Commission, traditional\nEU committees, national governments and IRAs \u2013 retain strong formal\npowers. There is little sign of a major shift in the allocation of formal\npowers in regulation.\nThis links to the third feature of network governance, which is still\nlacking: in terms of the formal structure of decisionmaking, hierarchy\nremains strong. In particular, EU committees continue to exist and to\noperate through voting and legislation. For their part, the ERNs have\nmany aspects of a traditional intergovernmental organisation, including\nthe importance of working by consensus. Indeed, their main formal\npowers are linked to that most hierarchical method of operating \u2013\npassing legislation \u2013 on which they advise.\nNetwork Governance and Multi-level Delegation \uf736\uf737\nOf course, the limits of the analysis should be acknowledged. They\nlargely flow from the principal-agent framework, which focuses on formal\ninstitutional structures and the relationship between principals and\nagents. ERNs suffer from severe weaknesses in their formal position, but\nmay be able to develop informal resources and linkages. These could\ninclude information, expertise, reputation and trust (Sabel and Zeitlin\n\uf732\uf730\uf730\uf737; Coen \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf735). If ERNs are able to obtain these resources, they may\nwield power that is out of proportion with their formal position.\nMoreover, as the regulatory space literature suggests (see Hancher and\nMoran \uf731\uf739\uf738\uf739; Scott \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf731), other actors may be more important to an\norganisation than its formal principal. For ERNs, linkages with the\nindustry may supply a vital source of power. Thus, ERNs may be able to\nalter governance by going beyond the formal institutional framework.\nNevertheless, analysis of that framework provides good evidence for\nwhy ERNs are subject to criticism as inadequate: on the one hand, they\nhave been given sweeping goals of co-ordinating diverse national IRAs\nand ensuring consistent implementation of EU law across the European\nUnion that relate to the heart of the single market; on the other hand,\nthey lack the powers and resources to do so. The EU\u2019s double delegation\nto IRAs and the European Commission has failed to resolve the EU\u2019s\nproblems of co-ordination and implementation. As a result, the issue of\ndelegation and co-ordination remains a topic of lively political debate in\nBrussels and national capitals, with discussion of Euro-regulators in\ntelecommunications and energy returning to the policy table in \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf736\u2013\uf737.\nBut the analysis presented here certainly suggests that network govern-\nance is far from the institutional position of regulation in Europe today.\nNOTES\n\uf731.
