Introduction\nThe impressive growth in foreign equity investments in emerging markets and the debate on the\nlikely implications for their integration with the global equity markets has prompted intense\nresearch interest in this subject matter. The current credit crises caused by the high defaults in the\nUS sub-prime market and its spill-over effects to other economies in both developed and\ndeveloping part of the world have further highlighted the need to investigate the role of foreign\ninstitutional investors in emerging stock markets. Although there are a number of studies which\nprovide evidence of increasing integration of emerging markets with the global markets\n(Syriopoulos, 2007; Chelley-Steeley, 2005; Dungey et al, 2004), none have so far examined the\nrole played by foreign investors on the long and short run financial linkages of emerging\nmarkets. In view of the global spread of current financial crisis and its likely implications for a\nnumber of emerging markets, it is both topical and theoretically desirable to understand the role\nand influence of foreign investors on the process of integration of emerging equity markets with\nthe global markets.\nThis paper draws inspiration from two main strands of the literature. The first one deals with\nintegration of emerging equity markets with the global equity markets by investigating the\ncorrelation structure and comovements in returns. There is a growing body of research that\nprovides evidence on the extent to which equity markets around the world have become\nintegrated (see for example, Chang, 2001; Kanas, 1998, 1999; Kwan, et al, 1995; Masih and\n2Mashi, 1997; Corhay, et al, 1993, 1995, Dickinson, 2000; Gerrits and Yuee, 1999; Pymonen and\nKnif, 1998). Focussing on the global linkages of Australian equity market with equity markets of\nits major trading partners and using data prior to 1996, Roca (1999) examines the price linkages\nbetween the equity markets of Australia and other developed markets, particularly US, UK,\nJapan, Singapore and developing markets of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea. Their result only\nsupports the short term dynamic linkages of the Australian equity markets with US and UK.\nFurther, Dungey et al. (2004) reports that equity markets in Australia are influenced by shocks\ncommon to all other markets around the world. Their study concludes that the US market plays a\nsignificant role in explaining the Australian equity market\u2019s movement whilst Australia\u2019s\ndomestic output has minimal impact on its own equity market. Yes in another investigation\naimed at examining the linkages in stock indices amongst the US, European and Asia-Pacific\ndeveloped markets, Hsin (2004) finds evidence consistent with extant findings of a strong\nlinkage and transmission effects among the regional participants in Europe, such as Germany,\nBritain and France and Asia-Pacific markets of Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore.\nEvidence on integration of emerging equity markets with the developed markets is somewhat\nmixed. For instance, Chan et al. (1992) examine data for the Asian emerging markets and find\nthat the markets are segmented. This finding is further supported by Lamba (2005) who uses data\nfor the period 1997-2003 from the South Asian emerging markets and concludes that most of the\nmarkets in his sample are segmented. Further, Bekaert and Harvey (1995) measure the degree of\nintegration using equity returns and conclude that some countries have become less integrated\nover time. In contrast to the findings mentioned above, there are a number of studies including\none by Jong and Roon (2005) which show that emerging equity markets have become more\nintegrated with the developed markets. In another recent study, Tai (2007) examines Asian\n3emerging market data and concludes that these markets have become integrated with world\ncapital markets since the time when these markets were first liberalised. Soydemir (2000)\ninvestigates the co-movements relationship between developed and emerging market economies\nusing the economic fundamentals and trade linkages as the basis. He concludes that Mexico and\nUSA show stronger linkages whereas Argentina and Brazil exhibit sign of weaker association\nand attributes the differences to the trade flows. However, Soydemir does not consider the short-\nrun dynamics and long run association of the trading activities of foreign investors, which has\nbeen reported as one of the key causes leading to the closeness of equity market (Errunza, 2001).\nThe second strand of literature deals with the dynamics of foreign investment flows and equity\nreturns in emerging markets (see, Froot et al., 2001, Bekaert, et al., 2002, Richards, 2005). There\nare two main streams that flow from this body of research. The first seeks to enquire whether\nforeign equity investors are attracted by higher returns offered by foreign equity markets (see,\nBohn and Tesar, 1996). The second attempts to investigate whether the impact of foreign equity\nflows on stock prices is permanent or just temporary as a consequence of the \u2018price pressure\u2019\nexerted by these flows (see, Bekaert, et al 2002).\nDespite the conjectures that foreign portfolio investors play an important role in increasing the\nglobal linkages (Errunza, 2001; Bekaert and Harvey, 2003 and Soyedemir, 2000), empirical\nevidence on the influence of foreign investors in the context of the global financial linkages of\nthe Asian emerging markets is lacking. This paper fulfils the gap by bringing together these two\nstrands of the literature and provides empirical evidence on the effect of foreign equity\ninvestment flows on the integration of the Asian emerging equity markets of India, Korea,\n4Taiwan and Thailand with the global markets.2 Most previous studies use foreign equity flow\ndata up to 2002. There is information which suggests that quite a few of the emerging markets,\nespecially those in Asia, have introduced significant changes in the foreign ownership\nrestrictions and have raised the limits on foreign ownership since 2001.3 Given this, there is a\nneed to investigate the extent of the impact foreign equity flows have had on the global linkages\nof the Asian emerging equity markets in more recent years. More recently, Rose and Li (2008)\nconducted a study using S&P\u2019s Emerging Market Data Base on 34 emerging markets. They use\nthe ratio of global and investable indices to show the impact of foreign participation on extreme\ncomovements for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. They use copula model with constant\nand time varying extreme correlation models and find affirmative result on the extreme\nmovements in the APEC equity markets. Our study does not focus on extreme co-movements\namong these markets but on the role of foreign portfolio investor\u2019s trading activity on the long-\nrun relationship and short-run dynamics with local equity markets. Our study not only shows the\nlong run association and short run dynamic linkages of the emerging Asian equity markets with\nglobal counterparts but also provides evidence on the role played by foreign investors in driving\nthe growth in the global linkages.\nOne of the reasons for relatively less research on this subject matter is that good quality high\nfrequency data on foreign equity flows for emerging markets is not easily available. Thus\nprevious research by Froot et al. 2001 uses proprietary data for equity flows from State Street\nBank and Trust whilst Bakaert et al., 2002 have had to rely on monthly capital flow data for their\nresearch that involved 20 emerging markets. The foreign equity flow data in this paper uses the\n2 Our choice of markets is restricted by the lack of availability of good quality daily data on other emerging equity\nmarkets.\n3 For instance, Taiwan increased the foreign equity ownership limit to 75% in 2000 from 50% in 1999 before\nremoving any limit towards the end of 2000.\n5same source as the one used by Richards (2005) but with two significant differences. First, we\nuse more recent data (from 2001 to 2007) so that the impact of more recent increases in the\nforeign equity ownership limits can be captured in the integration process of emerging equity\nmarkets. Second, unlike Richards (2005), instead of measuring integration with the US equity\nmarket, we use MSCI World Equity Market returns as a proxy for global markets because the\nforeign equity flow data from CEIC is aggregated and includes foreign investments from\ndifferent countries including the US. Thus our paper provides evidence with respect to the\nintegration of emerging equity markets globally rather than with the US market alone. The data\nused on foreign equity investments is daily which allows us to investigate long-run stochastic\nequilibrium relationship as well as short term dynamics. As our objective is to understand the\ndynamics of foreign equity investments not only on long term basis but also on the short-run\ndynamics, the use of aggregated daily foreign portfolio investments rightly justifies the use of\nhigh frequency daily data. Also except Richards (2005), no other paper has used high frequency\ndata in integration studies.\nOur research has important theoretical and policy implications. The rolling correlation of the\nAsian emerging market equity returns with the world market returns has grown over the years\n(see figures 1, 2, 3 & 4). Further, the interest of foreign investors in these markets has also grown\nwith time (see investment flow figures in Table 1). These developments will have significant\nimpact on asset pricing and portfolio allocations. Historically, one of the main motivations for\ninvesting in emerging markets was that these markets had low correlations with developed\nmarkets. However, if the present magnitude and pace of foreign investments are sustained over\ntime then the emerging markets would become fully integrated with the global markets. This\nmay have detrimental effect on diversification of risk since emerging equity markets have long\n6been viewed by international investors as segmented markets offering excellent diversification\nbenefits to international investors (see Chatrath et al., 1996). Further, there is research evidence\nthat increased foreign equity flows seems to cause greater volatility in the emerging equity\nmarkets which is a matter of concern to the policy makers.4 Thus the impact of increasing\nforeign equity investment flows on the integration of emerging equity markets is of high interest\nto both academics and policy makers. This is particularly relevant since there is evidence to\nsuggest that foreign investors appear to have short-term investment horizon and at the sign of the\nslightest of trouble, the foreign capital tends to leave at a much greater pace than the pace at\nwhich it arrives in emerging markets (see, Bekaert, Harvey and Lumsdaine, 2002).\nOur paper makes three important contributions to the existing literature. First, we extend the\nliterature by investigating both the long and short-run dynamics of the impact of foreign equity\ninvestment flows on global integration of the selected Asian emerging markets. Second, we use\nmore recent foreign equity flow and return data to capture the effect of increased foreign\ninvestment activity in emerging markets as a result of further relaxation of foreign ownership\nrestrictions. Finally, unlike previous studies we use MSCI world return index that comprise\ntwenty-three stock markets of industrialized countries which is a better proxy for measuring the\ndynamics of global linkages.\n4 There are several examples of interventions by policy makers concerned with the negative impact of foreign equity\nflows. For instance, Malaysia imposed capital controls in 1998 following the Asian financial crisis with an aim to\ncontrol the excessive volatility that appears to have been caused by a rapid outflow of foreign capital. In December\n2006, the Thai government tried to impose tough controls by requiring investors with more than $20,000 of\ninvestment to remain invested for a minimum period of one year or face severe penalties if this investment is\nremoved within a year. However, the government had to reverse this decision following a steep fall in the stock\nmarket after shares suffered their worst daily fall in 16 years and closed down 14.8%.\n7Our findings suggest that the foreign equity investment flows contain significant information in\nexplaining the short-run dynamics and long-run relationship of the selected Asian emerging\nequity markets with the global markets. Our results are robust in terms of synchronization and\nstatistical sensitivity of VAR based VEC and cointegration tests. We conclude that the rapid\ngrowth in the flow of foreign equity flows is leading to greater integration of the Asian emerging\nequity markets with the global equity markets. This may have significant implications for pricing\nof assets and international portfolio allocations.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The following section provides details of data and\nmethodology used in this study. Section 3 documents the empirical findings, and Section 4\nconcludes the paper.\n2. Data and Methodology\n2.1 Data\nWe use daily data in our analysis for a sample period of six years beginning 1 January 2001 to 30\nMarch 2007. We have segregated the data in two sub-samples to observe any time varying\nimpact as we note significant increase in the foreign equity investment flows in 2004-2007\nperiod (see Table 1). Daily returns are calculated from the MSCI global total return index which\nis a composite index of 23 developed markets and the MSCI total return emerging market indices\ndenominated in US$ for India, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.5 Our choice of emerging markets\nwas restricted because of lack of availability of daily equity portfolio investment data for other\nemerging equity markets. A further reason is that a considerably long period has elapsed since\nthese countries opened up their equity markets for foreign investments. Therefore, it is both\n5 Since our Net Foreign Equity Investment (NFEI) data represents total of all foreign portfolio investments, we use\nthe MSCI world index as proxy of global equity returns.\n8timely and appropriate to investigate the influence of foreign equity investments given the rapid\nincrease in the investment flows in more recent periods. The MSCI indexes have been obtained\nfrom DataStream international and net daily foreign equity portfolio investment data is obtained\nfrom CEIC.\n2.2 Methodology\nWe take a non structural approach for investigating the impact of foreign equity investment\nflows on the short and long run dynamics of Asian equity markets with the global markets.6\nOur analysis utilizes cointegration and vector error correction models. Cointegration approach is\nwidely used for examination of long-run stochastic relationship between equity markets (see\nKearney and Lucey, 2004 for a comprehensive review). For short-run dynamics, the use of\nVector Autoregression (VAR) analysis is quite widespread (see, Froot et al, 2001, Bekaert,\nHarvey and Lumsdaine, 2002, and Richard, 2005).\n2.2.1 Cointegration\nWe examine the long run relationship using VAR-based cointegration approach proposed by\nJohansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990). The Johansen-Juselius (JJ) approach is\npreferred because it is considered superior to regression-based approach suggested by Engle and\n6 Use of a non-structural approach in linkage studies is advocated by Bekaert and Harvey (2000) who suggest that\nbecause of lack of theoretical basis, non-structural approach should be preferred in conducting portfolio flow\nstudies. Further, Tesar and Werner (1995) report that even in the relatively open markets, the substantial increase in\ncross border flows do not comply with the theoretical foundations of optimal portfolio theory due to home bias\neffects.\n9Granger in 1987.7 The JJ approach uses maximum likelihood estimates and allows testing and\nestimation of more than one cointegrating vector in the multivariate system without requiring a\nspecific variable to be normalized. This way, the JJ test overcomes the problem of carrying over\nthe errors from the first step into the second step commonly encountered in Engle and Granger\u2019s\n(1987) approach. Further, Johansen\u2019s method is independent of the choice of endogenous\nvariable within a vector autoregression (VAR) framework. This enables testing for various\nstructural hypotheses involving restricted versions of cointegrating vectors and speed of\nadjustment parameters using likelihood ratio tests. The general VAR equation can be rewritten\nas;\ntptpttt yAyAyAy \uf065\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d ...............2211 (1)\n\uf02b\uf050\uf03d\uf044\n\uf02d1tt yy tptptt yyy \uf065\uf02b\uf044\uf047\uf02b\uf02b\uf044\uf047\uf02b\uf044\uf047 \uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d 112111 ........

If vector y contains m variables, matrix \uf050 will be of the order m x m, with a maximum\n7 The Johansen-Juselius procedure resolves the problem of endogeneity in that we do not need to normalise the\ncointegrating vector on one of the variables as required in the Engle and Granger (EG) test (see Cheung and Lai,\n1993).\n10\npossible rank of m (or full rank). Equation (3), except for the \uf050yt-p term, is in the form of the\ntraditional VAR with first difference. The \uf050 term determines whether the system of equations is\ncointegrated, i.e., whether a long-run equilibrium relationship exists. The feature to note is that\nthe rank of matrix \uf050 is equal to the number of independent cointegrating vectors. If rank of\nmatrix \uf050 = 0, the matrix is null, i.e., all the elements in this matrix are zero, which implies no\ncointegration or a lack of a long-run equilibrium relationship and the error correction\nmechanism, \uf050yt-k, therefore, does not exist. In determining the rank of matrix \uf050 (number of\ncointegrating vectors), we calculate the characteristic roots or eigenvalues i\uf06c\u02c6 of \uf050. Johansen\n(1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) propose trace (\uf06ctrace) and maximum eigenvalue (\uf06cmax)\ntest statistics to establish whether the characteristic roots are significantly different from zero.\nThe likelihood ratio (LR) statistic for the trace test (\uf06ctrace) is:\n\uf028 \uf029\uf0e5\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\nm\nri\nitrace Tr\n1\n\u02c61ln)( \uf06c\uf06c (6)\nWhere i\uf06c\u02c6 are the estimated values of the characteristic roots (also known as\neigenvalues) obtained from estimated \uf050 matrix. The null hypothesis to be tested is that the\nnumber of cointegrating vectors is less than or equal to r against the alternative hypothesis that\nthe number of cointegrating vectors is more than r. For example the null hypothesis r \uf0a3 0 against\nalternative r = 1, r \uf0a3 1 against alternative r = 2, and so forth. The \u2018maximum eigenvalue\u2019 test is\nused to evaluate the null hypothesis of r cointegrating vectors against the r + 1 cointegrating\nvectors. The LR test statistic is given by:\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf02b 1ln()1,(max Trr\uf06c )\u02c6 1\uf02br\uf06c (7)\n11\nThe computed values of \uf06ctrace and max\uf06c statistics are evaluated using the critical values provided\nby Osterwarld-Lenum (1992). The optimal system lag length is determined by using the Schwarz\nInformation Criteria (SIC). Specifically, the appropriate number of lags for each variable is\nobtained by computing the SIC over different lag schemes within a range of 1 to 20 and by\nchoosing the number of lags that yields the lowest value for the SIC.\n2.2.2 Error Correction Representations\nVector Error Correction Model (VECM) is employed on the cointegrated return series as this\nprovides us with an effective way to analyze the short-run relationship including causality and\nthe speed at which the error is corrected for establishing the long-run relationship found in the\ncointegration analysis. If variables are cointegrated they tend to converge in the long-run despite\nshort-run deviations. VECM examines this equilibrium relationship and provides a feedback\nmechanism, the error correction term, which gradually moves in tandem with the equilibrium\nrelationship. VECM also provides the mechanism to identify the magnitude and length of\ninformation being transmitted from one series to another through the system, referred as variance\ndecomposition and impulse response function respectively. The VECM is employed on first\ndifference of I(1) variables as shown below.\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nm\n1i\nit11 x\uf044\uf062t\u0394y + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\nm\n1i\nit12 w\uf044\uf062 + 13 \uf02dtz\uf062 + t\uf06d (8)\nEquation (8) is a three variable model with y and x being return series and w being the net\nforeign equity investment. The other representations with \u2206x and \u2206w could be similarly\npresented. The cointegrating vector zt-1 is the error correction term which will be I (0) if the\nabove series in their level term have long-run equilibrium relationship. This term corrects the\n12\nshort-term deviations and helps convergence of the series towards a long run equilibrium state.\nThe parameter 3\uf062 measures the speed of adjustment in the short term deviations whilst 11\uf062 and\n12\uf062 capture the short run causality. The lag length and coefficients are determined by OLS\nregression.\n2.2.3 Impulse Response Function\nImpulse response function explains the responsiveness of one variable in the VAR framework to\nthe shocks in its own as well as other variables. It explains the extent to which a unit shock in\none variable in isolation of the others affects the movement in other variables. In each of the\nequation, one unit shock is applied to detect the change in the VAR system over time by\nrepresenting the VAR as VMA (Vector Moving Average) representation:\ntRi, = 011b ti ,\uf065 +\n1\n11b 1,1 \uf02dt\uf065 +\n1\n12b 1,2 \uf02dt\uf065 +\u2026\u2026.. (9)\nWhere, bij are unit normalized innovation coefficients of impulse response function following the\nnormalization by the Cholesky factor8 and 011b is the simultaneous effect of a unit shock to ti ,\uf065 .\nThe contemporaneous innovation is stated in standard deviation form and have non-unit\ncoefficient in contrast to its unit coefficients in the equation.\n2.2.4 Forecast Error Variance Decomposition\nPrevious research has shown that variance decomposition analysis is quite effective in examining\ndynamic interactions amongst economic time series (Lutkepohl and Reimers, 1992). Whilst the\nimpulse response function traces the effects of a shock in one endogenous variable on other\n8 See Diebold (2004).\n13\nvariables in the VAR, variance decomposition enables further analysis by decomposing the\nforecast error variance of domestic return index and net foreign equity investment that will\nprovide us with a quantitative measure of the short run dynamic relationship among the\nvariables. The variance decomposition thus offers greater insights on the relative significance of\neach random innovation that affects the variables in VAR by showing the proportion of changes\nin variance caused by a shock in its own lags and by shocks in variance of other variables as well\nas the magnitude of the effects.\n3. Empirical Findings\nFirst we use rolling correlations and JJ cointegration methods for examining the long-run\nrelationship. Subsequently, we report the findings on short term feedback dynamics using\ndifferent variants of the error correction model. With an aim to establish whether the pick-up in\nthe foreign equity investments in more recent years following the impressive growth shown by\nthe Asian equity markets provides greater empirical support to our hypothesis, the total sample is\nsplit into two parts.9 Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the returns series and the foreign\nequity investment flow. Over the full sample period, highest daily returns are offered by Korea\nfollowed by Thailand, India and Taiwan. All four Asian markets offer much higher daily returns\ncompared to the returns of the MSCI developed market index. The trend is generally similar\nacross the two sub-sample periods with the exception that returns offered by Thailand and Taiwan\nin the second sub-period are lower than returns in the developed markets. Higher returns in\nemerging markets do not come without risk as the standard deviations of returns are much higher\n9 The first sub-period covers Jan 2001 to Dec 2003 and the second sub-period uses data for Jan 2004 to March 2007.\nThe growth of foreign equity investment flows is evident from Table 1 which shows that the average equity\ninvestment flows more than doubled in the second period of the sample. The average net daily foreign equity\ninvestment rose to US$98.33m during the period 2004-07 compared to US$45.57m for the period 2001-03.\n14\nfor the Asian emerging markets. The returns are not normal and show significant kurtosis. The\naverage daily foreign equity investment flows are much higher in the second sub-period. Taiwan\nleads the other markets in terms of foreign equity investment flows followed by India, Thailand\nand Korea.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Table 1 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Figures 1, 2, 3, & 4 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\n3.1 Results on Long-run Relationship\nTable 2 presents the unconditional correlation coefficient between the domestic returns of the\nAsian emerging markets and MSCI world index. There is an indication of a move towards greater\ncorrelations from the first-sub period to the second sub-period for all markets with India and\nThailand, in particular demonstrating relatively greater convergence in market movements. We\npresent the rolling correlations for the four emerging markets with the global market in Figures 1\nto 4.10 It is evident that though the correlations are not stable over time, a general trend of\nincreasing correlation is evident. The correlations appear to have increased significantly from\n2004 onwards which is confirmed from the increase in correlation in the second sub-period as\nshown in Table 2. Thus, the observed rise in correlation may partly be explained by the increase\nin the trading activity of foreign investors. This result is consistent with those reported by\nPhylaktis and Ravazzolo (2002) who also find statistically significant correlations amongst the\nemerging Asian markets and the US.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Table 2 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\n10 Several papers have used rolling correlations in investigating the equity markets integration. For instance, Lucey\nand Kearney (2004) use rolling correlations and conclude that they provide a good indication whether markets are\nintegrated or segmented.\n15\nNext, we employ the cointegration analysis which is a more robust approach in testing for long-\nrun equilibrium relationship. All series including the net foreign equity flow series are integrated\nof order I(1) whilst their first differences are integrated of order I(0). For adding robustness to our\nunit root test, we have reported the results from three different unit root tests. The Augmented\nDicky Fuller Test statistics is reported in panel A of table 3. As expected, all the test statistics are\nsignificant at 1% and 5% significance level for the first difference whereas the null of unit root\ncannot be rejected at level. Further the Philips Perron (PP) test was also applied, again testing\nthe null of unit root. PP tests include an automatic correction to the Dicky Fuller procedure\nallowing for the auto correlated residuals. As shown in panel B, the results are similar and all the\nseries have been found to have unit root in their level with no unit root in their first difference\nseries. Unit roots tests has always criticized for lacking power and so we also conducted the\nKPSS test testing the null of no unit root. The results with the alternative procedure are same. The\nnull of no unit root cannot be accepted in level series whereas the first difference null is accepted.\nFor the ADF and PP tests, lag selection is based on the minimization of SIC. KPSS tests were\nconducted up to 10 lags, however to save space, only 1st and 10th lag findings are reported.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Table 3 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\nTable 4 reports result of bivariate cointegration between the emerging Asian market returns and\nMSCI world index returns for the full sample period as well for the two sub-sample periods. For\nthe full sample, one cointegrating vector is found for India and Taiwan whereas no cointegration\nis reported for Korea and Thailand. Further analysis reveals that whilst no cointegration is found\nfor the first sub-period, results for the second sample period are similar to the full sample period\nand statistically significant cointegrating vectors are found for India and Taiwan. The results\nshow strong signs of convergence of the Indian and Taiwanese markets with the global markets.\n16\nThe greater degree of integration found for the second sample period coincides with the\nsignificant increase in the average foreign equity investment flow for India and Taiwan. The\naverage foreign equity investment flows for India and Taiwan increased to US$36.65 million and\nUS$54.19 million from US$9.841 million and US$33.22 million respectively. In comparison, the\nforeign equity investment flow did not show any increase in the case of Korea and a relatively\nsmall increase in the case of Thailand.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Table 4 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\nNext, we present cointegration analysis results where we include foreign equity investment flow\nseries with emerging market and world market return series. This analysis will provide us with\nthe relative contribution of the foreign equity investment flow in the long-run relationship\nreported in Table 4. The results of the tri-variate cointegration are reported in Table 5. Both the\ntrace and max trace statistics are significant for the full sample period as well as the two sub-\nsample periods. With the inclusion of foreign equity flow, at least one cointegrating vector is\nreported for all four markets thereby confirming that the integration process is driven by the\nactivities of foreign investors. For India, Taiwan and Thailand two significant cointegrating\nvectors are found for the second sample period confirming the influence of foreign equity flows\nin the integration process. A summary of the main findings of the cointegration analysis is further\nprovided in Table 6.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Table 5 and Table 6 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\n17\n3.2 Results on Short-term Dynamics\nAs previously discussed, the error correction provides feedback mechanism that measures the\neffect of a shock in one series as a result of a shock in another series in the VAR system. ECM\ncan only be applied on cointegrated series. Since our cointegration analysis results show that all\nfour markets are cointegrated only when foreign equity investment flows are included, we include\nthe foreign equity investment flow data in the ECM analysis. Four variations of the ECM analysis\nare reported. The first variation is the block exogeneity Wald test that measures the statistical\nsignificance of the flow of information between the variables in the form of Granger causality.\nThe second is the error correction term which shows the magnitude and speed of short-term\nadjustment. Third is the decomposition of the error variance which provides a quantitative\nmeasure of the short-run dynamic flow of information explaining the h-step ahead error variance\nin one variable due to transmission of shock in another variable in the VAR system. Finally, the\nimpulse response shows the time and direction of the effect of shocks between the variables.\nTable 7 presents the Granger causality and Error Correction Term (ECT) for each market. It is\nevident that the world market has significant causal impact on the return index of emerging\nmarkets as well as on the flow of net foreign investments. In contrast, none of the emerging\nmarkets seem to have any causal effect on the world market returns. These findings are consistent\nwith previous literature that has demonstrated that shocks from developed markets have\nsignificant impact on the Asian emerging markets (see for example, Dungey, 2004). Further, we\nfind that net foreign equity investment flows Granger cause returns in India, Taiwan and Thailand\nbut no causality is found for Korea.\n18\nTable 7 also reports the Error Correction Term (ECT) for all four markets as well as the foreign\nequity investment flows which are statistically significant implying that the short-term deviations\nin the integration process of the emerging markets with global markets are being corrected. The\nsignificant ECT for net foreign investment flows for all four markets confirms the considerable\ninfluence of foreign investment flow in correcting the short-term deviations in the integration\nprocess.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Table 7 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\nThe results are consistent with the price pressure hypothesis suggesting that foreign equity\ninvestors are mainly responsible for the increase in the stock market valuations in the Asian\nemerging markets. This suggests that the Asian emerging markets may become increasingly\nvulnerable to the shocks in the volume of foreign equity investment flows and thus become more\nvolatile in future. This is a matter of concern to policy makers in emerging markets and, as a\nconsequence some countries have attempted to restrict the flow speculative investment flows in\ntheir equity markets.11 Our results concerning the price pressure hypothesis are similar to those\nreported by Richards (2005) and much more pronounced than the ones documented by Froot et al\n(2001) for the Asian emerging markets. The results also confirm the positive feedback hypothesis\nsince it is clear that returns from emerging markets Granger cause the foreign equity investment\nflows, a finding similar to the ones reported in Froot et al (2001) and Bekaert et al (2002). The\n11 On 16 October 2007, India's stock market regulator proposed restricting the use of offshore participatory notes\n(PNs). PNs are much favoured by foreign investors, especially hedge funds who have been mainly responsible for\nUS$90bn investment in PNs. In reaction to this news, the Indian stock market promptly fell 9 per cent, triggering a\ntemporary halt to trading.\n19\nfindings further confirm that foreign investors are high-return chasers and extract information\nfrom recent returns.\nVariance decomposition analysis presented in Table 8 shows that in the case of India, a\nsignificant proportion of error variance is explained by the world market returns and its share of\nerror variance increases over time. In fact, its magnitude of explanation for the 20 day-ahead\nforecast variance is equal to the proportion explained by the variance in its own returns. For\nKorea and Taiwan, similar results are found which confirm the significant role of global markets\nin explaining the returns in the Korean and Taiwanese markets. For India, the proportion of\nvariance explained by the net foreign equity flow is small but increases over time from 3% for a 1\nday-ahead forecast to 6% for the 20 day-ahead forecast. The foreign equity flows also seem to\nexplain a large proportion of return variance of Taiwanese and the Thai markets. However, they\nhave negligible share in explaining the error variance in the case of Korea. Overall, the variance\nin net foreign equity flows is significantly explained by world equity market returns which\nsuggest that external shocks may significantly explain the volatility of foreign investments in\nemerging markets.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Table 8 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\nFigures 5 to 8 present findings of impulse response function analysis. In all cases, a unit\ncumulative innovation in world market returns has a significant and positive impact on the returns\nfor all four markets. Innovations in net foreign investment flows also show strong and\ninstantaneous effect in all markets. This evidence of contemporaneous price impact is consistent\nwith the one reported by Richards (2005) and is much stronger is much stronger than the one\ndocumented by Froot et al (2001). The second set of figures present the response of net foreign\n20\ninvestment flows to the lagged returns available in emerging markets as well as lagged\ninvestment flows and world market returns. The findings confirm the positive feedback\nhypothesis that foreign investor\u2019s activities are significantly influenced by the returns available in\nemerging markets.\n\u2026\u2026..Insert Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 here\u2026\u2026\u2026\n4. Conclusions\nThe paper investigates the impact of foreign equity investment flows on the integration of the\nemerging markets with the global markets. We use daily net foreign equity investment flow and\nstock index return data available for the four Asian emerging markets of India, Korea, Taiwan\nand Thailand for 2001-2007 and employ a number of econometric tests for examining the long-\nrun and short-run relationship with the global markets. Our findings suggest that greater\nintegration of the Asian emerging markets with the global equity markets appears to be\ninfluenced by the increasing investments by foreign investors. Analysis of short-run impact\nconfirms that the global markets have a significant causal impact on returns of all four emerging\nmarkets. More notable is the finding that foreign equity investment flows play a significant role in\ncorrecting the short-term deviations in the convergence process of Asian emerging equity markets\nwith the global equity markets. Whilst the results are consistent with previous research, we find\nstronger evidence for the positive feedback hypothesis for all four markets. The results support\nthe widely-held view that foreign investors are return chasers and their trading behaviour is based\non information drawn from recent returns available in the emerging markets. The results also\nconfirm the price- pressure hypothesis which suggests that foreign equity investors are mainly\nresponsible for the increases in the stock market valuations in the Asian emerging markets. In\n21\nview of the empirical evidence presented in this paper, the Asian emerging markets may become\nincreasingly vulnerable to the shocks in the volume of foreign equity investment flows and turn\nmore volatile in future.\n22\nReferences\nBekaert, G. and.
