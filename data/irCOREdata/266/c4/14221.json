He was a\nwonderful person to work with and to call a friend - he was warm, witty and wise, and fun\nto be around. I have tremendous respect for his work and his influence on the world of\nlearning technologies will be sorely missed. He was always interested in empirical work,\nand in the relationship between human-computer interaction and teaching and learning.\nSo I am delighted, with my co-authors, to submit this paper for the ALT-J special issue\ndedicated to his memory.\nWendy Hall, Southampton\n19\nMuan Hong Ng et al The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nIntroduction\nThe Web has a profound influence on teaching and learning today especially in higher\neducation. The evidence can be seen from simple online lecture notes to more complicated\ntutoring applications on the Web. The popularity of Web-based learning lies in the\nstrengths of its distributed nature and the ease of its browsing facility. On the other hand,\nemerging technology such as adaptive hypermedia brings new flexibility and the capability\nof personalization into the conventional static presentation of materials on the Web.\nAdaptive hypermedia is a recent direction of research at the crossroads of hypertext\/\nhypermedia and user modelling (Brusilovsky, 2001; De Bra, Brusilovsky and Houben,\n1999b). The goals of this research are to improve hypermedia usability and achieve\npersonalization by bringing the right content to the right person at the right time and the\nright place.\nA survey of medical training in the United Kingdom (Towler, 1991) proposed replacing the\nconventional theory-based teaching methods with an emphasis on the development of\nmedical skills. In addressing this issue, a number of computer-based systems have been\ndeveloped, such as MR Tutor (Sharpies, du Boulay, Teather, Teather, JefFery and du\nBoulay, 1995) for radiology training and ATLAS (Garlatti and Sharpies, 1998) in neuro-\nradiology.\nIn this article, we outline the collaborative experience and strategies taken in developing a\nWeb-based learning application in rheumatology - namely JointZone. JointZone\n(Armstrong, Hall, Maier and Ng, 2002; Ng, Armstrong, Hall and Maier, 2002a) was\ndeveloped primarily for university medical students. The content exists in the form of an\n'electronic online textbook' which is liberally illustrated. A number of video clips and over\n700 illustrations have been included. In an additional section, there are a total of 30 case\nstudies. The 'virtual patients' in the case studies present rheumatic disorders set in a variety\n. of clinical scenarios, most of which arise frequently in the typical district general hospital\nrheumatology clinics. It was a joint project involving a medical expert generating the\ncontent and an educational developer tackling the pedagogical issues of the Website. The\nWebsite shows an example of how adaptive hypermedia can be used to present a\npersonalized learning experience. An evaluation has been carried out with medical students\nto look specifically at how the integration of adaptive hypermedia supports learning in this\nenvironment.\nTo provide some background, this article will first describe the pedagogical rationale and\nthe approach to hypermedia linking that was fundamental to the development of the\napplication. Then, it explains more about adaptive hypermedia and how various adaptive\nfeatures were integrated into JointZone. Finally, the article presents the results of the.\nevaluation undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the adaptive features, and concludes\nwith a discussion including suggestions for future work.\nBackground\nPedagogical rationale ,\nThe theory of situated learning promotes the acquisition of knowledge.in a meaningful\ncontext (Brown, Collins and Duguid, 1989; Herrington and Oliver, 1995). In the situated\nmode of learning, students are put through authentic life experiences where knowledge\n20\nALT-} Volume 10 Number 3\nX LITTER V T HISTORY f\nExamination\nYou have taken the patient's history and now you must examine the patient.\nPatient's general appearance:She looks well.

The theory suggests that learning\nthrough real-life experiences produces more usable and robust knowledge (Brown et al,\n1989) as compared with inert knowledge (Whitehead, 1929) that is only useful in school\nexaminations. In recent research, this situated learning approach began to be adopted as a\nmodel of instruction in computer-based learning environments (Bransford, Sheerwood,\nHasselbring, Kinzer and Williams, 1990). In supporting this situated learning approach,\nhypermedia is capable of presenting engaging interactions with the students and at the\nsame time providing a database of information to support learning (Harley, 1993; Reeves,\n1993). Hypermedia can be used to provide an alternative for the real-life settings by\nenriching the learning experience with graphics, videos, audio and text simulation. The\nemergence of adaptive hypermedia further ensures that the provision of learning materials\ncan be adapted to different needs and knowledge background of the users.\nThe approach of situated learning prompted the integration of interactive case studies in\nJointZone to simulate the clinical diagnosis process of a rheumatologist. The case studies,\nwhich are developed by a rheumatologist, provide a real life clinical context where students\ncan actively engage in problem-solving rather than being passive recipients of information.\nStudents are able to develop procedural knowledge which includes interpretation of\nclinical information and decision-making. The case studies are graded into three levels:\nbeginner, intermediate and advanced. For the beginner or intermediate cases, the scope of\npatient scenarios is narrower and the diagnosis choices are more restricted compared with\nadvanced cases (see Figure 1). At every stage in a case study, relevant feedback and\nresponses are given to users so that they can benefit from the expert's experience and\nopinion (see Figure 2). In order to relate the case studies (procedural knowledge) to the\n21\nMuan Hong Ng et al The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nHome Login I Glossary I Search I About EM\nReferral Letter | Patient's History | * Exit Case Study\nNotes:\nV = Correct choice X = Incorrect choice O = Correct answer but you did not select It.\n1 .

The number of pages proposed for further reading depends on the level\nof knowledge of the users. The motivation for this is to expose more learning concepts to\nusers of higher competency and to avoid overloading users of lower competency.\n22\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nHypermedia linking\nIt is important that information is well cross-referenced to ensure the ease of navigation\nthrough learning materials on the Web. Easy accessibility to pieces of information such as\ntext, video, audio or images is important to avoid the user being frustrated during the\nlearning process. The issues of how and what to link are non-trivial in order to present\nlearning materials more effectively to the users. In JointZone, three types of links are used\n(Lowe and Hall, 1999: 33) and they each serve a different purpose. The three types of links\nare:\n\u2022 Structural links which provide navigation by connecting pages according to the\nstructural design of the site.\n\u2022 Referential links (or glossary links) which provide answers to the question of 'what is\nxT. They link a word to its explanation, which can be a mixture of text, image or video.\n\u2022 Associative links provide learners with the opportunity to find out more about a\nconcept They interlink pages of related concepts according to the semantics of the\ndomain.\nThis is the commonest form tof joint\nstraightforward degenerative\/ proces\nSeveral different patterns a * recogr\nrecognrjedr-For instartceT-ajere is a [joints ({\"HeberEien's nodes) which\nosteoar&Tntis-oMJie -knee-tSstrongty\nFanners are particularly prone to dev\nof arthritis such as rneumatoid disi\nsynovium . in osteoarthiftis. the\nsubchondral bone. *^**v^\nBony swellings on distal interphalangeal joints (at the end* of the fingers) a\nosteoarthritis.

Referential links (see Figure 4) are used to check out the meaning of a word or a\nphrase that appears in a predefined glossary database. They are found everywhere in the\nsite where a glossary word appears. These links are implemented based on the Microcosm\ngeneric linking mechanism (Fountain, Hall, Heath and Davis, 1990) which enables the\nlinks to be generated automatically. Lastly, associative links are used to interlink pages,\neither internally or with an external site, that are related by a common context. For\nexample, when a user is looking at the context of a disease - 'osteoarthritis of the knee',\nthey could follow the associative links to find out more about the general concept of\n'osteoarthritis' or the disease management on 'knee surgery'. All links except structural\nlinks are stored in link databases. This separation of links from the documents enables\n23\nMuan Hong Ng et ol The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nmore flexibility in link management. For example, any update to a referential or associative\nlink need only be done once in the database and the changes will be propagated to the\ninstantiation of links in the domain.\nThe details of how the three types of links are created in JointZone are reported elsewhere\n(Ngef al. ,2002a).\nImplementation of adaptive hypermedia features in JointZone\nAdaptive hypermedia\nThe paradigm of Web publishing has shifted from static to dynamic presentation. A Web\nsite no longer displays static information but rather is capable of adapting its content to\nperceived user needs and individual knowledge. The relatively new idea of adaptive\nhypermedia (AH) leads to applications that reflect knowledge about the components of a\nlearning environment. Adaptive applications model the domain knowledge they represent\nand actively capture information about users as they interact with the application. The\nusers' cognitive burden regarding what links to follow is transferred to the system, thus\nreducing the problems of information overload and 'being lost in information space'\n(Thuring, Hannemann and Haake, 1995).\nAn AH system normally consists of a user model (that describes information about the\nuser such as their knowledge, preference etc), a domain model (describes the domain subject\nat the conceptual level) and an adaptation model (describes how the adaptation can be\ndone) (De Bra, Houben and Wu, 1999a; De Bra and Brusilovsky, 1998). Users' individual\ndifferences and needs are met through two levels of adaptation: adaptive navigation\nsupport (ANS) and adaptive presentation (Brusilovsky, 2001; De Bra, 1999). Adaptive\npresentation adapts content to users by presenting different versions of the same piece of\ninformation based on their needs. ANS adapts to users by tailoring the presentation of\nlinks. Techniques in this area include link hiding, link sorting, link annotation, direct\nguidance and map adaptation (Brusilovsky, 2001). Link hiding is achieved by disabling the\nfunctionality of irrelevant links in an attempt to limit users to only the set of links relevant\nto their goals or background knowledge. Link annotation is achieved by annotating links\nwith extra information about the links. For example ELM-ART (Brusilovsky, Schwarz and\nWeber, 1996) uses a traffic-light metaphor where different coloured balls are used to\nannotate links in order to indicate whether the user is ready for the links.\nThe basis of adaptation in JointZone\nThe literature shows that in most educational AH systems, the idea of curriculum\nsequencing is used to model the domain into prerequisites, remedial and outcome topics\nbefore the aggregated learning materials are presented adaptively to the students based on\ntheir current level of knowledge (Stern and Woolf, 2000; Brusilovsky et al, 1996;\nBrusilovsky, Eklund and Schwarz, 1998; De Bra and Calvi, 1998). From the perspective of\nauthoring, this method increases the burden on the domain expert manually to design a\nprerequisite network of the contents. In some cases this problem is solved because the\napplication designers are experts in the information domain themselves, a reason why\nmany educational AH applications are built in the domain of computer science (Stern and\nWoolf, 2000; Brusilovsky et al, 1996; De Bra and Calvi, 1998).\n24\nALT-} Volume 10 Number 3\nDomain model\nThe content of JointZone is in the medical domain and the domain experts do not have\nenough time manually to sequence the content. Hence we adopted the idea of text\nprocessing from the area of information retrieval to identify the semantics of the contents\n(Ng et al, 2002a). This method freed us from requiring prohibitive effort from the domain\nexpert in organizing and labelling the content. Text processing is applied to the contents in\norder to extract keywords that can be used as indexing terms for the documents. Indexing\nterms are (document) words whose semantics reflect the document's main themes. They are\nused to index or summarize a document (Baeze-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).\nKnowledge-based adaptation model\nThe availability of keywords to represent the documents conceptually enables link-level\nadaptation based on the user's background knowledge in rheumatology. This is achieved\nusing link hiding. For example, for the topic of 'Milwaukee shoulder', advanced students\nare provided with access to documents about the concepts: 'Milwaukee shoulder,\nhydroxyapatite, crystal, polymyalgia' (four concepts), while intermediate students are\ndirected to only three concepts namely 'Milwaukee shoulder, hydroxyapatite, crystal', and\nbeginners are simply shown the single concept of 'Milwaukee shoulder'. The domain\nexpert identifies these three sets of concepts for three different user groups (advanced,\nintermediate and beginner), which is an easier task for them compared with delivering a\nprerequisite network of documents. From the user's point of view, this incremental way of\nlinking through link hiding helps reduce information overload, since fewer reading pages\nare directed to less well-equipped students. However, in order to be consistent with the\nphilosophy of an unobtrusive learning environment, there is no restriction for any user\ngroup should they wish to investigate further; that is, the reading documents allocated for\nthe advanced level are still accessible to a beginner.\nUser model\nAs for user modelling, the user's knowledge levels are drawn from a 'prior knowledge\nonline test' given at the first login to the application. This test categorizes users into one of\nthree knowledge levels, and on subsequent access the users are transferred automatically\nfrom one user group to another based on their performance in previous case studies.\nJointZone also captures the user's browsing history (pages visited) in order to provide\nanother type of link-level adaptation - namely history-based link annotation. The system\nkeeps a record of a user's individual effective reading speed (Jackson and McClelland,\n1979) which is assigned when they first use the application. An 'effort index' (Ng, Hall,\nMaier and Armstrong, 2002b) is then calculated for each document visited. A page will\nhave a higher effort index if the page display time approximates an optimal reading time.\nThe optimal reading time is measured based on the length of the page and the individual\neffective reading speed.\nHistory-based adaptation model\nThe effort index stored in the user model is used to construct a reading gauge (see Figure\n5), which is then used to annotate links. This provides history-based link annotation which\ngives users additional information on how much of a page has been read and helps them to\nfocus on pages on which they have spent little or no time.\n25\nMuan Hong Ng et al The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nM Shoulder Surgery\nElbow Surgery\nKnee Surgery\nHip Surgery\nFigure 5: An example of set of links annotated by the reading\ngauge, which indicates high (H), medium (M) or low effort\nindex (L)\nPersonalization features in JointZone\nJointZone implements various personalized features based on the history-based link\nannotation and knowledge-based link hiding techniques mentioned above. These features\ninclude:\n\u2022 a personalized reading room (see Figure 3) that adapts to each interactive case study to\nprovide further reading on concepts related to the cases;\n\u2022 a personalized site map (see Figure 6) that serves as a navigational tool;\n\u2022 a personalized topic map (see Figure 7) that encourages goal-oriented reading by\nadapting pages to the user's short-term reading goal (a self-selected reading topic),\nbrowsing history and knowledge level.\nFor all the above AH features, the combination of adaptation mechanisms based on the\nuser's browsing history and knowledge level helps users to focus on the number of\ndocuments that are suitable to their knowledge background, and at the same time helps\nusers obtain extra information on what they have already read and how much they have\nread during previous visits to the site.\n<5-,l 3.4 -I S'\\ v-l <\nfigure 6: A screen shot of the\npersonalized site map where links\nare annotated by the reading\ngauge\n26\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\n\u00a3fc \u00a3rjt y\u00bbw\n* \u2022 . \" \u2022\nB\u00ab* Few\nFjvote\nd\nlook M*\nBete* Home Search Favorite* H\u00abWy \u2022\n\u2022 . \u2022- \u2022 - . : \u2022 . \u2022 - \u2022 \u2022 . \u2022 ' : : \u2022 . \u2022 . . : \u2022 \u2022 ' ^ a\n\u2022 \u2022 . . . \". ^\n^.JointZone _, ,. , T . .,\nmAsndr^ unutoiocrx Personalised Topic Map IE\u00abIMIIIHome\nReading Gauge Exolainl: [ I ] io\u00bb [ M ] \"\u00ab*\u00bb\u00bb Q high Your status: Intermediate\nPick a reading topic: |Adhesive capsulms T] Click for suggested reading - ]\nLeamingConcepts:capsuR)s,frozen,cdr Display options: peninner I Wefmediale I advanced I\n\" * \u2022 Here are documents suggested on the reading topic, please dick on the link to reatf.\nBasic Science Rheumatic Disorders Approach To Patient\nEndocrine\nDisease Management Investigations\nFigure 7: A screenshot of the personalized topic map, which suggests reading pages based on the\nuser's short-term goal (reading topic), knowledge level (e.g. intermediate) and browsing history (reading\ngauge)\nUsability study\nTo assess the usability of the application prior to the evaluation of the adaptive\nhypermedia features, a usability study on JointZone was carried out with 29 undergraduate\nstudents who were taking a course module on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The\nsubjects consisted of 3 females and 26 males with an average age of 19 (stdev = 2.06).\nIn the study, the students were first asked to fill in an online demographic questionnaire.\nThen they were shown a list of online instructions to guide them to the site. Based on these\ninstructions, users had to explore JointZone by observing its structure, navigation facilities\nand presentation styles. They were given a set of tasks such as: look up the meaning of a\nmedical term using the site, locate a document and attempt an interactive case study.\nFinally, they were asked to complete an online feedback questionnaire (see Appendix A)\ncreated using a list of guidelines suggested by Preece (2000) for evaluating Websites. The\nquestions in the questionnaire were categorized into navigation (the ease of getting around\nthe site), accessibility (the ease of the authentication procedure and page loading time),\npresentation (site layout and graphical design) and subjective feedback (the users' opinion\nof the site). The usability result was calculated by dividing the total feedback score on the\nLikert scale by the number of users and the number of questions for each category.\nAs seen from the chart below (see Figure 8), the result shows no major concern with the\noverall usability of the Website since all four categories achieved an average score of above\n3. The accessibility perspective of the Website gained the highest score reflecting the ease of\nusing the Website. This is even though most subjects were using a relatively slow\nconnection (accessed from home using a standard 56k (or slower) telephone modem)\nduring the study.\n27\nMuan Hong Ng et al The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\n3 ,\nLikertScale 4 \"\nDisagree) to\n1 -\nUsability Study Result for N = 29\n\u2022 35862 ^ L ' !\ni * \\ i\nnavigation accessibility presentation subjective\nfeedback\nUsers' Feedback\nFigure 8: Usability result on the L\/kert scale\nEvaluating adaptive hypermedia\nEducational hypermedia was the first application area to see the introduction of adaptive\nhypermedia techniques before the research extended to other areas such as tourism,\ne-commerce and news portals. Classical projects such as ELM-ART (Brusilovsky et al,\n1996) and AHA! (De Bra and Calvi, 1998) are Web-based systems used to develop adaptive\nonline courses. However there is a significant lack of evaluation in this area and much\ndebate as to how an AH application should be evaluated. The conventional method of\ncomparing an adaptive and non-adaptive version of an application is debatable (De Bra,\n2000) as most adaptive systems are developed with particular adaptive techniques in mind\nand removal of these techniques causes a loss of the system's basic functionality. Therefore,\nany evaluation using AH vs non-AH techniques will not result in a fair comparison. The\nbasic non-adaptive design of JointZone was optimized based on the usability study before\nany personalized mechanism was integrated into the site. This was to make sure that the\nbasic functionality of the Website was not overshadowed by the advantages given by the\npersonalized mechanisms. This provided a fairer comparison between the adaptive and\nnon-adaptive version of JointZone.\nA recent approach has been proposed by Karagiannidis, Sampson and Brusilovsky (2001),\nwhich is known as layered evaluation. This approach suggests two layers of assessment:\n\u2022 Interaction assessment layer - assess whether the assumption drawn by the system\nconcerning characteristics of the user-computer interaction is valid, for example, is the\ninference of the user's knowledge level accurate?\n\u2022 adaptation decision layer - assess whether the adaptation decision is valid and\nmeaningful, for example, is the set of links presented based on the user model\nmeaningful?\nThis approach provides researchers with the opportunity to identify the problems behind a\nfailed implementation and to target the solutions accordingly (Brusilovsky, Karagiannidis\n28\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nand Sampson, 2001). For example, it can be the case that the adaptation decisions are\nreasonable, but they are based on incorrect system assumptions; or that the system\nassumptions are correct but the adaptation decision is not meaningful, or both cases can\nhappen at the same time. The evaluation of JointZone followed this approach in order to\ntarget a solution properly should any problem arise.\nIn previous work, some of the comprehensive evaluations that were performed in\neducational AH have shown encouraging results. For example, the empirical studies\nperformed by Boyle and Encarnacion in MetaDoc (Boyle and Encarnacion, 1994) have\nindicated that adaptive presentation can improve content understanding. Also, an\nempirical study of ISIS Tutor (Brusilovsky and Pesin, 1998) has shown that adaptive\nnavigation support can increase the speed of navigation in learning for certain groups of\nusers.\nExperimental evaluation of JointZone\nThe purpose of the evaluation of JointZone was to find out whether:\n\u2022 the personalized features facilitate the process of learning in JointZone by reducing the\ntime taken to look for materials on the site and reducing the number of navigational\nsteps;\n\u2022 the personalized features improve learning in JointZone in comparison with learning\nwithout the presence of any personalized mechanism.\nThe evaluation on JointZone was performed with university medical students. A number of\nsessions were carried out involving a total of 36 students (see Table 1) with the same level\nof prior knowledge (T-test, t=0.298, sig.=0.768). Before each session the subjects were\ngiven an overview of the Website and were taught how to use the personalized topic map.\nAfter each session, the students were interviewed individually to find out if they had any\nproblems or comments on the Website.\nGroup\nGroup\nGroup\n1\n2\nYear 1\n12\n7\nYear 2\n4\n3\nYear 3\n3\n3\nYear 4\n2\n0\nYear 5\n0\n2\nTotal\n21\n15\nAverage prior\nknowledge\n51.4%\n50%\nTable I :The distribution of subjects in the experiment according to their year of study and their\naverage score on the prior knowledge test\nDuring the evaluation, the students were randomly assigned into two groups: the first\ngroup used the personalized version of JointZone and the second group used the non-\npersonalized version of the site. A series of predefined tasks were set up for the students,\nasking them to look up information using the topic map and to try out the case studies.\nPre- and post-tests were used to assess the user's improvement in learning. Time taken and\nthe number of navigational steps required to complete a task were logged in order to assess\nwhether the personalized features affected either of these metrics.\n29\nMuan Hong Ng et al The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nResults\nThe results are grouped into objective and subjective feedback. The subjective feedback is\nbased on the user's opinion collected from the questionnaire whereas the objective\nfeedback is based on the dependent factors such as time taken, performance in the pre- and\npost-tests, and navigational steps.\nSubjective feedback on navigational features\nFigure 9 shows the general subjective feedback on the various navigation features in\nJointZone. As indicated in Table 2, all except one of the subjective user feedback results are\nsignificantly positive, above a confidence level of p < 0.01. This result shows that students\nwelcomed the idea of using a variety of navigational support mechanisms to help them to\nget to a piece of information faster and easier. In the case of users' preferences between a\npersonalized site map and a table of contents, 50 per Cent of the users preferred the former\nand 31 per cent had no preference. This indicates a browsing style where users were still not\nprepared to give up the conventional table of contents as a navigational aid but at the same\ntime they welcomed the idea of a personalized site map.\nUser Subjective Feedback (General)\nE Agree Q Neutral \"Disagree\nTopic map is Topic map is Reading room Ivwlluse I prefer the Personalised\nhelpful to easy to use is helpful to reading room personalised sitemap is\nfind after each\ninfotmation case study\nlocate\ninformation\nQuestionnaire\nsite m ap than\ntable of\ncontent\nuseful in\nnavigation\nFigure 9: General feedback on the various navigation features in JointZone\nSubjective feedback % positive feedback\nTopic Map is helpful to locate information\nTopic Map is easy to use\nReading room is helpful to find extra information\nI will use reading room after each case study\nI prefer the personalized site map to the table of content\nPersonalized site map is useful in navigation\n89\n72\n83\n83\n53\n94\nTable 2: Summary of the general subjective feedback from users on the various navigation\nmechanisms in JointZone\n30\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nSubjective feedback on adaptive link hiding and adaptive link annotation\nThere was inconsistent subjective feedback from the students regarding the various\nadaptive features integrated into these navigation mechanisms. As shown in Figure 10, a\nsignificant number of students felt that there were too many links suggested in the adaptive\nreading room. However, in the case of the non-adaptive reading room, no significant\nconclusion can be drawn to show that users are satisfied in terms of the number of links\nsuggested (see Table 3). This scenario suggests that users needed some sort of filtering\nmechanism in the reading room but the current implementation of adaptive link hiding is\nnot capable of delivering the right set of links. The reason for the negative opinion on\nadaptive link hiding in the reading room could be due to the incorrect adaptation on\ndecision-making by the system. For example, a student might be wrongly assigned to a user\ngroup that is of a higher level than their knowledge level; hence he or she is overwhelmed\nby the number of links suggested. The evidence of incorrect assignment of user group can\nbe seen from the poor performance of subjects in the case studies, as will be shown later in\nthis section.\nSubjective Feedback (Adaptive link hiding)\n100%\njg 80%\n~ 60%h\nI 3 20%\ni 3 0%\nf\/\/M\n47%\n13%\n\u2022 Too many\n\u2022 Not Enough\n0 Just Nice\nAdaptive linking in reading room N o adaptive linking in reading\nroom\nExperiment condition\nFigure 10: The subjective feedback on the number of links suggested in the reading room, with and\nwithout adaptive link hiding\nSubjective feedback\nNumber of links in reading room with adaptive linking.,\nNumber of links in reading room with non-a\"daptive linking.\nTable 3: Summary of subjective feedback on adaptive link\nSubjective feedback\nReading gauge is helpful in personalized topic map\nReading gauge is helpful in personalized site map\nMajority result\n52 % (too many)\n47 % (too many)\n40 % (just nice)\nhiding in JointZone.\nMajority result\n50 % (neutral)\n84 % (agree)\nTable 4: Summary of subjective feedback on adaptive history-based link annotation injointZone\n31\nMuan Hong Ng et al The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nit\nu\nm\na\n100%\n80%\n60%\n40%\n20%\n0%\nSubjective Feedback (Adaptive Link Annotation)\n8%\nmmm\n\u2022 50%\nmm,\ny\/\/\/\/\/A 0 Disagree\na Neutral\na Agree\nReading gauge is helpful in Reading gauge is helpful in\nPersonalised Topic Map Personalised Site M.ap\nQuestionnaire\nFigure 11: The subjective feedback on the helpfulness of the reading gauge based on the browsing\nhistory of individual users (adaptive link annotation)\nIn the case of the feedback on the history-based link annotations using the reading gauge,\nusers found them useful on the personalized site map but not significantly useful in the case\nof the personalized topic map (see Figure 11). The main reason could lie in the nature of\nthe task being assigned to the students when using the topic map in the experiment. The\ntask is concerned with looking up information, hence the focus of the students was more\non finding answers regardless of whether they have or have not read a page. In addition,\nthe presence of the reading gauge might not have the initial expected impact since the\nbrowsing history might not have been sufficiently built up due to the short period of\nexperiment time. The personalized site map received better feedback as it shows all pages;\nhence changes in the reading gauge are more significant. At the same time, the\npersonalized site map serves a different purpose, that of revision or general reading; thus\nthe importance of the reading gauge is more significant in tasks of this nature. This might\nexplain why users find the reading gauge more useful in the personalized site map as\ncompared with the personalized topic map.\nObjective feedback on topic map\nIn the experiment, the users' objective feedback was captured and analysed through various\nlearning factors such as the time taken to complete a learning task, the learning\nperformance gathered from pre- and post-tests and the number of navigation steps\nrequired. Two groups with two different experimental conditions were set the same task of\nlearning about 'psoriatic arthritis'. The first group used a topic map (without any adaptive\nfeatures) and the second group had the aid of the table of contents for free browsing. The\neffect of using navigation tools in supporting learning can be seen from this experiment. As\ncompared to free browsing, the results (see Table 5 and Figure 12) indicate that the topic\nmap significantly reduces the time taken and the number of navigation steps required to\ncomplete a task. The learning performance of students in the topic map group was also\nsignificantly better.\n32\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nLearning factors\n(objective feedback)\nExperiment condition\nIndependent t-test\nTopic map Free browsing (equal variance assumed)\nTime taken to complete 13.8+ 22.4\na task (minutes)\nLearning performance 7.69+ 4.9\n(-10 to 10)\nNavigational steps (average) 6.3* 11.9\nt = 3.02, p = 0.007***\nt = -2.65,p = O.OI5**\nt = 3.1 l,p = 0.008***\n* * Statistically significant at 5 per cent level * * * Statistically significant at I per cent level + Best result\nTable 5: Summary of the effect of using topic map and free browsing on time taken, performance and\nnavigational steps\nComparison of Time, Score and Navigation Step\n0 Free Browsing \u2022 Using Topic Map\n=i 25\nTime taken to Performance (Pos-test Navigation Steps taken\nc ompl ete Task - P re-te st) to c o mp lete ta sk\nDependant Variables\nFigure 12: The difference of using topic map and free browsing on time taken, performance and\nnavigational steps\nObjective feedback on personalization\nIn analysing the effect of personalization on learning factors, two groups of users were\nasked to use the personalized and non-personalized topic map respectively for a task of\nlearning about rheumatoid arthritis. As seen from the results (Figure 13 and Table 6), the\nintegration of personalized features on the navigation tool (topic map) did not result in any\nsignificant improvement in terms of the time factor and of learning performance. However,\nit did significantly reduce the number of navigational steps required to complete the\nlearning task. Hence, it can be concluded that the personalization features on the topic\nmap in JointZone do not improve learning (performance) but partially facilitate the\nprocess of learning since they do help in reducing the number of navigational steps\nsignificantly but not in the time taken.\n33\nMuan Hong Ng et al The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nComparison of Time, Score and navigation Step between\nN on-Adaptiv e To pic Ma p E Adaptiv eTopicMap\n2S.5\nTime taken to\ncomplete Task\nPerformance (Post - Navigation Steps\nPre-test) taken to complete\ntask\nDependant Variables\nFigure 13: The effect of personalizing navigation tools in learning\nLearning factors\n(objective feedback)\nExperiment conditions\nNon-adaptive Adaptive Independent t-test (equal\ntopic map topic map variance assumed)\nTime taken to complete\ntask (minutes)\nLearning performance\n(-10 to 10)\nNavigational steps\n22.5\n6.07\n28.5\n22\n5.25\n15.1\nt = O.IO7,p = 0.916\ninsignificant\nt = 1.045, p = 0.308\ninsignificant\nt = 2.271, p = 0.036**\n* * Statistically significant at 5 per cent level\nTable 6: Summary of the effect of personalizing navigation tools in learning\nAdaptive assignment of case study on learning performance\nIn evaluating the adaptive assignment of the case studies, the system's decision-making was\nput under scrutiny. The results revealed the sensitivity and accuracy of the system in\ninferring the user's knowledge level and assigning case study levels (beginner, intermediate,\nadvance). As usual, two groups of users were involved. The first group (system assign) was\nasked to do a case study from a study level assigned by the system whereas the second\ngroup (self assign) selected a study level of their own choice. Their performance in the case\nstudies was then compared.\nIn order to find out whether the assignment of case studies was accurate, a metric we called\n'allocation fitness' was calculated by using the case study scores. For example, if a user\nscores between 0 and 30 per cent in a case study, the allocation fitness is set to 'too difficult'\nto indicate that the level of case study assigned was higher than the user's knowledge level.\nIf the scores fall between 30 to 80 per cent, they will be considered 'optimal', indicating the\nright level of case study, and a score of above 80 per cent will give an allocation fitness of\n'too easy'. Figure 14 shows the comparison between the allocation fitness of the 'system\nassign' group and the 'self assign' group. The result revealed that more than half the\n34\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nThe Analysis of System Adaptation Decision Making in Assigning Case\nStudies - A comparison between system-assign and self-assign groups\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n0\nQ System Assign\nE3 Self Assign\nToo Easy Optimal\nAllocation Fitness\nToo Difficult\nFigure 14: The analysis of allocation fitness from the system adaptation decision-making in assigning\ncase studies\nstudents in the 'system assign' group were assigned case studies that were at 'too difficult' a\nlevel for them (Chi Square Test = 3.86, p= 0.05, significant level of 5 per cent). In this\ngroup, only 30 per cent of the users were correctly assigned the right level of case studies.\nThis indicates the need for the tuning of the system's adaptive decision-making mechanism\nby reducing the current assignment threshold. On the other hand, the result of the. 'self-\nassign' group revealed the majority of the users know the correct level of case studies for\nthem. Nine students are in the 'optimal' category and six students fall in the 'too difficult'\ncategory. However this result is not significant (Chi-square = 0.6, p= 0.439), so we cannot\nclaim that the users know better than the system in terms of the right level of case studies\nfor them.\nDiscussion\nFrom the pedagogical perspective, this evaluation has given insights into whether the\nadaptive features really benefit the students or whether they were technology-driven.\nBefore any conclusion can be made, a few issues need to be taken into consideration.\nFirstly, the outcome of this evaluation has shown that the effectiveness of the adaptive\nhypermedia features relies on what types of AH techniques are being used (link annotation\nor link hiding), where the features are applied (site map or topic map) and the nature of the\ntasks involved (general browsing or information look-up). Hence, the effectiveness of the\nadaptive hypermedia features could be both application and task-dependent. This is shown\nby the contradictory subjective feedback where the history-based link annotation (reading\ngauge) proved to be very useful in the personalized site map, but this is not the case for the\npersonalized topic map.\nSecondly, the accuracy of the adapted decision-making by the system also proves vital; for\nexample in the case of adaptive link hiding in the personalized reading room, the outcome\nis disappointing due to the inaccurate user group assignment. The same problem arises\nwith the adaptive case study assignment. The system's adaptation model needs fine tuning\n35\nMuan Hong Ng et 0\/ The application and evaluation of adaptive hypermedia techniques\nin order to improve the mapping of the current prior knowledge test score to different user\ngroups.\nThirdly, the current system might not be sensitive enough in inferring the user's knowledge\nlevel. The prior knowledge test used, which consisted of multiple-choice questions, might\nbe too general to capture the user's knowledge of the domain as compared with the level of\ncomplexity in the case study. Unfortunately, no test has been carried out thus far to verify\nthe accuracy of the prior knowledge test. If the test proves inadequate, it might not be\npossible to develop a good set of questions to test the user's knowledge level correctly.\nQuestions like this involve addressing cognitive issues which are beyond the scope of this\nwork.\nConclusions\nJointZone represents a medical Web-based learning application that embodies both\ndeclarative knowledge (domain knowledge) and procedural knowledge (interactive case\nstudies) through a personalized and interactive learning environment. It allows users to\nengage with the learning materials more effectively through various adaptive linking\nstrategies.\nTo simplify the adaptive hypermedia authoring, the idea of keyword indexing was used to\nmodel the domain, hence avoiding the need for prohibitive effort and time from the domain\nexpert. A simple student model was constructed based on the user's knowledge level and\nbrowsing history. This contributed to the novel idea of using effective reading speed to\ngauge better if a student has read a page. The work has applied the combination of\nknowledge-based link hiding and history-based link annotation on a fully functional\nWebsite to present an adaptive Web-based learning environment.\nThe evaluation of various adaptive features on the Website has provided feedback from the\nusers both subjectively and objectively. Overall, users welcomed the various navigational\nsupport features built into the application. The use of the topic map as navigational aid\nsignificantly improved the students' learning performance and reduced the time and\nnavigation steps required compared with free browsing. Users' opinions revealed that they\nlike the personalized features that are integrated into the Website, particularly the\npersonalized site map which used the history-based link annotation. However, from the\nobjective analysis, there is no evidence to show that the integration of the personalization\nfeatures has improved learning or facilitated the learning process except to reduce the\nnumber of navigational steps. This might be due to the inaccurate system adaptation\ndecision-making.\nBased on the evaluation, it can be concluded that the potential of the personalized learning\nenvironment is promising as the students welcomed the personalized features in the\nlearning environment. However, the implementation of the adaptive mechanisms still\nneeds refinement, particularly in system-adapted decision-making before it can make a\nsignificant impact in Web-based learning.\nJointZone has been officially published online and is currently in use with medical students\n(Armstrong et al, 2002). Further evaluations are planned over a longer period of time to\nobtain more reliable feedback from real-time usage.\n36\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nAcknowledgements\nArthritis Research Campaign, UK, educational project grant A0549.
