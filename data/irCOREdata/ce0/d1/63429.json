Defining Information Technology \n \nGeoscience after IT, published as a book (Loudon, 2000) and a special issue of \nComputers & Geosciences, offers a broad overview of the impact of information \ntechnology on the work of geoscientists, seen against the background of evolving \nglobal communication on the Internet.  \n \nInformation technology (IT) refers to methods of handling information by automatic \nmeans, including computing, telecommunications and office systems.  It deals with a \nwide range of mostly electronic devices for collecting, storing, manipulating, \ncommunicating and displaying information.  Examples of IT devices are: computer \nsoftware and hardware, including memory and disk storage; printers; the telephone, \ncable, broadcasting and computer networks; office copiers; facsimile (fax) machines; \nDVDs; video cameras; image scanners; televisions and monitors; data loggers and \nautomated instruments in the field and laboratory; sensors on satellite cameras or \ndownhole logging tools; digital surveying equipment. \n \nIT applications seldom respect disciplinary boundaries. The focus here is geoscience, \ncentered on geology but inevitably overlapping into such subjects as geophysics, \ngeochemistry, economic geology, engineering geology, and soil science. I \noccasionally stray into related aspects of environmental science, surveying and \ngeomorphology, but try to steer clear of such topics as hydrology, meteorology or \noceanography, which may be parts of the Earth Sciences in the wide sense, but are \nwell covered in their own specialized publications. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part  A (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \nA primary task of geoscientists is to add to the base of recorded knowledge. \nPhilosophers have made valiant attempts to say what knowledge is (see, for example \nAudi, 1998). Workers in computer expert systems and knowledge bases take a more \npragmatic approach. Addis (1985) defines knowledge as \u201cjustified true belief\u201d, seen \nnot as referring to a state of the brain, but as a shared human response to a complex \nenvironment. Information can be defined as something that adds to one\u2019s knowledge \nand understanding, and includes data (known facts) and their interpretation. The \nprefix meta- is sometimes used to refer to a higher logical type.  Thus metalanguage \ndeals with the nature, structure or behavior of language.  Similarly, metadata is the \nname sometimes given to data about data, describing the data so that they can be \nunderstood beyond their originating project.  The broader term metainformation \nrefers to information about information. Definitions of knowledge, information and \ndata seem to lead more rapidly than most to circularity.  However, as the underlying \nconcepts are familiar, these should serve our present purpose. \n \n2. The significance of IT to geoscience \n \nModern IT offers opportunities for more effective handling of geoscience information \nin three main areas. The first is the obvious ability of computers to calculate, thus \nopening up possibilities of more rigorous analysis with quantitative and statistical \nmethods, and more vivid graphical presentation with visualization techniques. A \nsecond area is the manipulation and management of information. This starts with the \nability to move words around in a word processor or to move elements of a picture in \na graphics system. It leads to the ability to capture data, store vast quantities of \ninformation in a database or document management system, and retrieve specific \nitems on demand.  A third area is hypertext linkage with rapid dissemination and \ndisplay of multimedia information through worldwide telecommunications and the \nInternet. \n \nIT influences the way in which scientists investigate the real world, how they are \norganized, how they communicate, what they know and how they think. They depend \nless on intermediaries like typists, cartographers, librarians and publishers for \nacquiring information and disseminating their findings. They can collaborate more \nwidely, thanks to better control and flow of information. Individual workers and \ngroups can enjoy greater autonomy within a defined, shared framework. \n \nTaken together, the benefits from IT (see part B) include better science, cost savings, \nand speed and flexibility in data collection, storage, retrieval, communication and \npresentation.   \n \n3. This publication \n \n3.1 Target readers \n \n\u2022 Practicing geoscientists with a general interest in how modern information \ntechnology (IT) will affect their work and influence future directions in their \nscience  \n\u2022 Geoscientists, familiar with computer or IT applications in their own specialist \nfield, who need a broader perspective on future trends \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part  A (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n\u2022 Students or educators specializing in IT applications in geoscience who \nrequire a top-down view of their subject \n \n3.2 Objectives \n \nTo provide an overview and rapid reference to assist readers to: \n\u2022 understand the ways in which geoscientists can collect, record, analyze, \nexplain, assemble and communicate information in the evolving geoscience \ninformation system \n\u2022 understand how IT affects methodology and enables hidden constraints \nimposed by traditional methods to be overcome \n\u2022 understand the theory underlying IT applications and know how to find \nexamples and guidance for their implementation \n\u2022 form a view on future trends and thence develop a framework to influence \nnew developments and operate effectively within them \n \n3.3 Structure and overview \n \nOne effect of IT can be to separate content from container. The same material can be \nheld (as here) in an electronic archive and presented as a book, a special issue of a \njournal or a set of articles for browsing on screen or printing locally. I have tried to \nharmonize the results with established bibliographic conventions and terminology, \nand apologize for any remaining confusion. \n \nAlthough I wrote this account for reading in sequence, there is probably enough \nrepetition and cross-reference for you to refer to sections out of context. I hope you \nwill have little difficulty in dipping into sections of interest from the table of contents, \nabstracts and keywords. Internal cross-references should help you to follow threads \nleading to similar topics.  \n \nThe parts deal with the following topics. \n \nParts A-B: definitions and motivation.  \nInformation technology deals with tools for handling information, notably computers \nand networks. Geoscience can benefit from IT through more efficient and rigorous \nformulation and expression of ideas, and wider sharing and integration of knowledge. \nProgress requires a broad systems view. This account should help geoscientists to \nunderstand the overall changes and form a view on future trends. \n \nParts C-H: familiarization with IT methods and the underlying theory. \nNot all geoscientists are familiar with available methods of IT, although these \ninfluence all phases of a project and every type of information. This review looks for \nunderlying principles, moving from individual to project to global requirements. It \ntracks the process of familiarization, from ubiquitous tasks like word processing \nthrough statistical analysis and computer visualization to the management of \ndatabases and repositories. \n \nParts I-M: the emerging system.  \nEarlier parts dwell on the benefits of IT and the nature of IT tools. For a clearer view \nof how geoscience and IT will interact, we need to reconsider our own methods of \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part  A (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part  A (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \ninvestigation: how we observe, remember and record, how we build knowledge from \ninformation, cope with changing ideas, and create a shared record in the geoscience \ninformation system. Our methods relate to the potential of IT: the flexibility of \nhypermedia, the developing standards for the global network of cross-referenced \nknowledge, and the particular value of well-organized structures of geoscience \nknowledge. They help us to understand the emerging geoscience information system, \nto define our requirements and to build on current initiatives and opportunities, which \nare outlined here.  \n \n3.4 Acknowledgments \n \nI remember with gratitude the help of too many colleagues to list here.
