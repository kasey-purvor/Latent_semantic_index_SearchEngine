General practitioners remain to be\nconvinced that they have a role in attempting to\nreduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by targeting\ninterventions at patients with impaired glucose\ntolerance.\nIntroduction\nType 2 diabetes is a serious condition, with implications\nfor the mortality, morbidity, and social functioning of\npatients. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is\nincreasing, and the number of patients in the United\nKingdom is expected to rise from just over one million\nin 1997 to just under three million by 2010.1 This will\ninevitably be reflected in rising costs. An estimated\n7\u203a8% of the total NHS budget is spent on patients with\ntype 2 diabetes,2 and the burden of caring for these\npatients is falling increasingly on primary care.3 4\nImpaired glucose tolerance, typically characterised\nby hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, is considered\nto be a stage in the development of type 2 diabetes. Up\nto half of all people with impaired glucose tolerance\nwill progress to type 2 diabetes within 10 years of diag\u203a\nnosis.5 In addition, people with impaired glucose toler\u203a\nance are known to be at significantly increased risk of\ncardiovascular disease, which may present before the\nonset of diabetes.6 Studies in the United Kingdom have\nreported the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance\nin the 35\u203a65 year age group to be around 17%.7\nIncreasing evidence indicates that intervention can\nfavourably influence the clinical course of impaired\nglucose tolerance,8\u201310 with some studies showing a 58%\nreduction in progression to diabetes.11 12 However,\ninformation is lacking on British general practitioners\u2019\nawareness of the clinical significance of impaired\nglucose tolerance and their current management of\nthese patients. This study aimed to ascertain levels of\nawareness among general practitioners of the preva\u203a\nlence and clinical significance of impaired glucose tol\u203a\nerance and to explore their attitudes to its detection\nand management.\nMethods\nParticipants and setting\nFocus groups\nWe used stratified random sampling (to give a\nrepresentative male:female ratio from each primary\ncare group) to recruit participants for the focus groups.\nWe chose general practitioners from lists supplied by\nDerwentside, Sunderland West, South Tyneside, and\nGateshead West and Central Primary Care Groups. We\ninitially contacted potential participants by telephone\nand then invited them by letter to take part. We\ncontacted 56 general practitioners, of whom 28 agreed\nto participate; two of these failed to attend. The\nremaining 26 general practitioners (18 men, eight\nwomen) participated in four focus groups (three\ngroups of seven participants and one group of five\nparticipants). The mean age of participants was 44\n(range 30\u203a58) years; all were principals, with a mean of\n11 (1\u203a27) years\u2019 experience in general practice. The 30\ngeneral practitioners who either declined or failed to\nattend were similar in terms of sex and practice charac\u203a\nteristics. The table shows the characteristics of\nindividual participants.\nParticipants received an honorarium of \u00a350.00. We\nheld two focus groups in district general hospital post\u203a\ngraduate centres, one in a general practitioner surgery,\nCentre for\nIntegrated Health\nCare Research,\nWolfson Research\nInstitute, University\nof Durham,\nStockton\u203aon\u203aTees\nTS17 6BH\nGraeme Wylie\nNorthern and\nYorkshire Regional\nHealth Authority\nresearch training\nfellow\nA Pali S Hungin\nprofessor of primary\ncare\nJoanne Neely\nresearch officer\nCorrespondence to:\nG Wylie\ngraeme.wylie@\ndur.ac.uk\nbmj.com 2002;324:1190\npage 1 of 6BMJ VOLUME 324 18 MAY 2002 bmj.com\nand one in the Centre for Health Studies, Durham\nUniversity. The average duration of focus groups was\n75 minutes.\nSemistructured interviews\nWe chose the eight participants (six men, two women)\nin the semistructured interviews purposively13 from a\nlist of all general practitioners in one health authority.\nAll were principals, with a mean age of 41 (31\u203a46) years\nand an average of 12 (4\u203a24) years\u2019 experience in\ngeneral practice. Participants were chosen to reflect\ndiversity in terms of age, sex, practice characteristics\n(list size, geographical location), and involvement in\ndiabetes care (little involvement, lead general prac\u203a\ntitioner, clinical assistant in diabetes, primary care\ngroup adviser on diabetes) (table). All general\npractitioners invited agreed to take part. We conducted\nthe interviews at participants\u2019 surgeries, and interviews\nhad an average duration of 35 minutes. Participants\nreceived an honorarium of \u00a325.00.\nCollection and analysis of data\nThe lead investigator (GW) carried out all the focus\ngroups and interviews, which were audiotaped for later\ntranscription. Before each focus group, participants\ncompleted a questionnaire designed to evaluate their\nknowledge of the clinical significance and prevalence\nof impaired glucose tolerance. Their responses were\nthen explored in the focus group discussion. The lead\ninvestigator then gave a short presentation, based on a\nreview of the literature, on the anticipated rise in\nprevalence of type 2 diabetes, together with the clinical\nsignificance, prevalence, and management of impaired\nglucose tolerance.1 2 5\u201311 Further focus group discussion\ncentred around participants\u2019 attitudes to impaired glu\u203a\ncose tolerance in the light of what, for most of them,\nwas new knowledge.\nWe took a similar approach with the semistruc\u203a\ntured interviews, administering the questionnaire\nverbally and following this with open ended questions\nconcerning knowledge of the clinical significance and\nprevalence of impaired glucose tolerance. We then\ngave a short presentation, as above, and used\nsubsequent open ended questions to explore attitudes\nto and perceptions of the detection and management\nof impaired glucose tolerance.\nWe used a \u201cpragmatic variant\u201d grounded theory\napproach to analyse the data by generating categories\nand themes.14 15 GW and APSH coded the data\nindependently to increase the reliability of the study.\nWe adopted an iterative approach to data analysis, with\nanalysis beginning after the first focus groups and\ninterviews, to allow emerging themes to be explored in\nsubsequent interviews. The coders agreed that no new\nthemes were emerging after four focus groups and\neight semistructured interviews, and saturation was\nachieved.15\nCharacteristics of participants in focus groups (coded FGnx) and semistructured interviews (coded INTn)\nCode Age (years) Sex\nEmployment\nstatus\nYears in\npractice\nSize of\npractice\nlist No of partners Practice area Role in diabetes\nFG1a 58 Male Full time 25 1 950 1 Suburban Lead general practitioner\nFG1b 41 Female Full time 15 12 300 6 Semirural Little involvement\nFG1c 37 Male Full time 5 20 000 9 Urban Little involvement\nFG4d 48 Female Full time 5 3 100 2 Semirural Little involvement\nFG1e 50 Male Full time 14 4 200 2 Suburban Equal role with others\nFG1f 44 Male Full time 13 3 750 2 Semirural Equal role with others\nFG1g 52 Male Full time 27 2 300 1 Rural Lead general practitioner\nFG2a 37 Male Full time 4 12 200 5 Suburban Primary care group adviser\nFG2b 50 Female Part time 11 8 700 6 Suburban District diabetes advisory group\nFG2c 44 Male Full time 2 4 500 2 Urban Lead general practitioner\nFG2d 36 Male Part time 4 8 000 4 Semirural Little involvement\nFG2e 55 Male Full time 25 6 100 3 Urban Lead general practitioner\nFG3a 40 Male Full time 12 5 000 3 Urban Equal role with others\nFG3b 47 Male Full time 18 3 000 1 Urban Lead general practitioner\nFG3c 37 Male Full time 7 10 000 4 Urban Lead general practitioner\nFG3d 53 Male Full time 14 8 500 3 Urban Little involvement\nFG3e 36 Female Part time 1 6 500 4 Suburban Little involvement\nFG3f 42 Female Full time 11 11 500 7 Suburban Lead general practitioner\nFG4g 44 Male Full time 20 5 000 3 Urban Little involvement\nFG4a 34 Female Part time 3 11 000 7 Urban Little involvement\nFG4b 45 Female Full time 16 9 800 6 Urban Little involvement\nFG4c 30 Female Full time 1 7 100 4 Suburban Little involvement\nFG4d 40 Male Full time 2 2 700 1 Suburban Lead general practitioner\nFG4e 54 Male Full time 20 3 400 1 Suburban Lead general practitioner\nFG4f 37 Male Full time 7 8 400 4 Semirural Lead general practitioner\nFG4g 42 Male Full time 14 2 000 1 Semirural Lead general practitioner\nINT1 31 Male Full time 4 8 500 5 Suburban Little involvement\nINT2 51 Male Full time 24 15 000 6 Urban Lead general practitioner\nINT3 46 Female Part time 14 15 000 8 Suburban Clinical assistant\nINT4 36 Male Full time 6 2 150 1 Semirural Lead general practitioner\nINT5 46 Male Full time 15 23 000 12 Semirural Equal role with others\nINT6 42 Male Full time 15 20 000 9 Suburban Lead general practitioner\nINT7 42 Male Full time 13 9 800 4 Semirural Primary care group adviser\nINT8 34 Female Part time 6 7 200 5 Rural Little involvement\nPrimary care\npage 2 of 6 BMJ VOLUME 324 18 MAY 2002 bmj.com\nValidation\nTo increase confidence in the validity of the findings,\nwe sent all 34 participants a report summarising the\noutcomes of the study. Twenty eight (82%) replied stat\u203a\ning that they \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d (10 respondents) or\n\u201cagreed\u201d (18) that the report was a true representation\nof their opinions.\nResults\nQuestionnaires\u2014All participants were aware of impaired\nglucose tolerance as a clinical entity. However, 16 (47%)\nparticipants were unaware of the risk of impaired glu\u203a\ncose tolerance progressing to type 2 diabetes, and 21\n(62%) were unaware of the increased risk of cardiovas\u203a\ncular disease. In addition, 17 (50%) participants had no\nidea how many patients with impaired glucose\ntolerance might be known to their practice, and 13\n(38%) estimated prevalence at less than 1% (figure).\nFocus groups and interviews\u2014Three main themes\nemerged from data collected before participants\nreceived a presentation detailing the anticipated rise in\nprevalence of type 2 diabetes, together with the clinical\nsignificance, prevalence, and management of impaired\nglucose tolerance (box 1). Eight main themes emerged\nafter the presentation (box 2).\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to investigate general practi\u203a\ntioners\u2019 knowledge of the prevalence and clinical\nsignificance of impaired glucose tolerance and their\nattitudes to its detection and management. The results\nindicate that awareness of the existence of impaired\nglucose tolerance was good but that awareness of the\nprevalence and clinical significance of impaired\nglucose tolerance was poor. In addition, general practi\u203a\ntioners seem to be uncertain about how best to\nmanage and follow up these patients. This has implica\u203a\ntions for the training and education of general\npractitioners, and not least for patient care in a field\nthat is likely to expand exponentially in the next few\nyears.\nThe study also indicates that only a small\nproportion of patients with impaired glucose tolerance\nare currently known to practices and that general prac\u203a\ntitioners are reluctant to pursue more aggressive case\nfinding and management, even after being presented\nwith a critical appraisal of the literature. Several factors\nseem to contribute to this unwillingness to screen and\nintervene in this condition. General practitioners were\nafraid of being overwhelmed by the workload\ngenerated, admitting to reluctance to divert finite\nresources away from other clinical areas, and were pes\u203a\nsimistic about the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention.\nFurthermore, some felt strongly that screening patients\nfor impaired glucose tolerance and subsequent lifestyle\nintervention would medicalise an essentially social\nproblem and that a health educational approach,\ninvolving schools and the media, should be adopted\ninstead. Other studies have shown that general\npractitioners lack confidence in their ability to change\nlifestyle behaviour and suggested that the solution\nwould be to increase training and support.16 17 Pill et al\nhave shown how difficult it is for primary healthcare\nprofessionals to change patients\u2019 behaviour in the con\u203a\ntext of type 2 diabetes.18 Our findings are in broad\nagreement with those of Lawlor et al, who found that\ngeneral practitioners were in favour of measures to\ntackle social and environmental determinants of ill\nhealth.19\nConversely, some of the general practitioners in\nthis study expressed a positive attitude towards\npharmacological intervention in patients with\nimpaired glucose tolerance, even though the effective\u203a\nness of this has yet to be shown in large scale clinical\ntrials. This may be because of the perception that phar\u203a\nmacological intervention is ultimately likely to be more\neffective than lifestyle intervention. However, it could\nalso be argued that the act of prescribing drugs for\nthese patients essentially defines impaired glucose tol\u203a\nPrevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (%)\nNo\n o\nf g\nen\ner\nal\n p\nra\nct\niti\non\ner\ns\nDon't know <0.5 0.5-0.9 1.0-2.0 >2.0\n0\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n2\nGeneral practitioners\u2019 estimation of the number of patients known to\nhave impaired glucose tolerance in their practice\nBox 1: Main themes from data collected before\nparticipants received evidence based\npresentation on impaired glucose tolerance\nLow awareness of the prevalence and clinical\nsignificance of impaired glucose tolerance\n\u201cI would have no idea . . .

I mean, I occasionally get people who\u2019ve had a borderline high sugar and it gets passed to the nurse for\ndietary intervention . . . they don\u2019t all have a glucose tolerance test; the reason for that is it involves a whole lot of\nworkload\u201d (FG3c)\n[\u201cSo there\u2019s a resistance from the profession because of the workload implications, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d] \u201cYes,\nbasically\u201d (FG2d)\n\u201cWho wants to find someone you\u2019ve got to treat and measure their blood every so often?\u201d (FG3d)\nConcern that widespread screening and management of patients with impaired glucose tolerance would be\nimpossible without extra resources\n\u201cThe practices simply can\u2019t be taking all the load.

There are\nbarriers on a health authority scale\u2014it\u2019s going to be, it might mean a shift of resource towards one thing rather than\nsomething else\u201d (INT8)\nPessimism regarding the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention\n\u201c. . . we have diabetics who . . . who just totally ignore the advice you give them, and I think going further back than that\nand giving them advice when they haven\u2019t got diabetes as such is going to be very difficult\u201d (INT4)\n\u201cAround here, I just wonder how effective lifestyle advice is going to be\u201d (INT6)\n\u201c. . . trying to persuade them [patients with type 2 diabetes] to make any changes at all in their behaviour just makes\nmy heart plummet . . . the initiative [giving lifestyle advice to patients with impaired glucose tolerance] coming from\nus, I think, is doomed to failure (FG3e)\nPositive attitudes towards pharmacological intervention in patients with impaired glucose tolerance\n\u201cWell, even that [lifestyle intervention] is a tall order for a lot of them. I just feel as though, if you\u2019re going to do this,\nyou\u2019ve really got to put them on metformin. I mean that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with our [CHD patients] . . . I mean we\nstarted off with exercise, diet and that kind of thing, stopping smoking, and now, I mean we\u2019ve substituted that with\nstatins, atenolol, and lisinopril . . . I think it shouldn\u2019t be too expensive; metformin presumably is a comparatively cheap\ndrug\u201d (FG2c)\n\u201cMore than happy, I mean we . . . we\u2019re starting to come on board with this as a group . . . a high risk group that . . . um\n. . . sort of an aggressive treatment is the only way to possibly, to make any difference. So yes, I would be happy to\nprescribe\u201d (INT7)\n\u201cI think if I had impaired glucose tolerance I would take the metformin to delay the diabetes\u201d (FG4g)\nUncertainty regarding the role of general practitioners in detecting and treating impaired glucose tolerance\n\u201cI think it\u2019s our job to educate people and give them the information and let them make the choice. I think the people\nwho are motivated, who are in control of their own lives, will take that advice and act on it and then the rest of the\npeople will just carry on until something bad happens\u201d (FG2d)\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a role in that [detecting and lifestyle intervention for impaired glucose tolerance] to some degree,\nbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s educating everybody in town and sort of leading their lives for them\u201d (FG1f)\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not my job, you know; I\u2019m a GP and I\u2019m actually there probably not to do a lot of prevention but to actually\ndo a little bit of tinkering with the people already ill\u201d (FG4f)\nConcern that screening and treating impaired glucose tolerance medicalises an essentially social problem\n\u201cIt\u2019s a society cop out; we\u2019re always trying to medicalise things, and it\u2019s the same as, you know, I think, the current vogue\nfor medicalising teenage pregnancy . . . and under age smoking and everything else\u201d (INT5)\n\u201c. . . these [preventing chronic disease] are all kind of social things, and throughout history what we have to accept, as\ndoctors, is that we have a very minimal impact on the health of society\u201d (FG4f)\n\u201cI think it\u2019s on a bigger scale than us having to prevent it [type 2 diabetes] right at the end of the line. It\u2019s like us\npreventing suicides when there\u2019s unemployment and stress\u201d (FG3e)\nPositive attitudes towards a health educational approach\n\u201cI think improvements could be made with people with glucose tolerance if they are educated about glucose\nintolerance at school; if they could have fruit at school instead of hamburgers and chips they probably . . . and\ntherefore the change has to start from school up and the responsibility of educating I think should be put on to\nschools\u201d (FG1a)\n\u201cIf all schools had free fruit and free healthy living, free exercise . . . then in 20\u203a30 years\u2019 time I suspect the impact of\nthat would be enormous\u201d (FG4d)\n\u201cI think health promotion must have a huge responsibility\u2014they have a huge budget . . .

This has implications for\nguideline development. General practitioners have posi\u203a\ntive attitudes towards the use of guidelines,21 although\nproblems exist with regard to implementation.22\nMethodological considerations\nThe rigour of this study was increased by triangula\u203a\ntion,23 both of methods and analysis, and by validation\nby respondents. However, few data were available on\nthe 30 out of 64 general practitioners who either\ndeclined or failed to participate. Although sex and size\nof partnership were broadly similar, we had no way of\nknowing if the knowledge and attitudes of these\ngeneral practitioners differed from those participating\nin the study. In addition, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that the personal and intellectual bias of the\nlead investigator (GW) may have shaped the data. This\nhas been minimised by making the account as reflexive\nas possible and by reporting a wide range of different\nperspectives, a method described by Mays and Pope as\n\u201cfair dealing.\u201d23 Factors relating to the ethnic origin of\npatients did not emerge as a theme from our data. Two\nout of eight general practitioners interviewed were of\nAsian ethnic origin, and each focus group contained\none or two such participants. The population\nprevalence of patients of Asian ethnic origin in the\nstudy area is low (0.3% for County Durham, 0.5% for\nGateshead and South Tyneside, and 0.6% for\nSunderland, compared with 3.3% for England and\nWales24). This may limit the generalisability of our study\nto areas with large ethnic minority populations.\nConclusions\nThe recently published Diabetes National Service Frame\u203a\nwork: Standards document recommends that the NHS\nand partner organisations adopt both a \u201cpopulation\u201d\napproach (tackling obesity and sedentary lifestyles)\nand a \u201ctargeted\u201d approach (identifying and intervening\nin high risk groups, such as patients with impaired glu\u203a\ncose tolerance) to reducing the incidence of type 2\ndiabetes.25 The national service framework recognises\nthat such interventions are also likely to have an impact\non reducing cardiovascular disease. Similarly, early\ntreatment of macrovascular risk factors may be more\nimportant than screening for and treating asympto\u203a\nmatic type 2 diabetes itself.26 Although studies from\nother countries have shown encouraging results,11 12\nquestions about the feasibility of primary prevention of\ntype 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom remain\nunanswered. Our findings clearly show that general\npractitioners have major reservations about the appro\u203a\npriateness and effectiveness of giving lifestyle advice to\npatients in this context. Similarly, we have shown that\ngeneral practitioners perceive the need for consider\u203a\nable extra resources if they are to be given the task of\nscreening for impaired glucose tolerance and interven\u203a\ning in patients at high risk of progression to type 2\ndiabetes. This has important implications, both for the\nimplementation of the diabetes national service frame\u203a\nwork and for primary care research.\nWe thank the general practitioners who participated in the study\nand Brenda Hall, Glenys Ambrose, Jan Roach, and Jane Przbor\u203a\nski for transcribing the tapes.\nContributors: GW conceived the study.
