Introduction\nParadoxically, improvements in healthcare that have enhanced the life\nexpectancy of humans in the Western world have, indirectly, increased the\nprevalence of certain cancers such as prostate and breast. It remains unclear\nwhether this phenomenon should be attributed to the ageing process or the\ncumulative effect of prolonged exposure to harmful environmental stimuli, such\nas ultraviolet light, radiation and carcinogens (Franks & Teich 1988). Equally,\nthere is compelling evidence that certain genetic abnormalities can predispose\nindividuals to specific cancers (Ilyas et al. 1999).\nThe variety of factors involved in the development of solid tumours stems, to a\nlarge extent, from the fact that \u2018cancer\u2019 is a generic term, often used toPhil. Trans. R. Soc.

M. Byrne and others1564characterize a series of disorders that share common features. At this generic\nlevel of description, cancer may be viewed as a cellular disease, in which controls\nthat usually regulate growth and maintain homeostasis are disrupted. Cancer is\ntypically initiated by genetic mutations that lead to enhanced proliferation rate\nand the formation of an avascular tumour. Since it receives nutrients by\ndiffusion, the size of an avascular tumour is limited to several millimetres in\ndiameter. Further growth relies on the tumour acquiring the ability to stimulate\nthe ingrowth of a new, circulating blood supply from the host vasculature via\nangiogenesis (Folkman 1974). Once vascularized, the tumour has access to a vast\nnutrient source and rapid growth ensues. Further, tumour fragments that break\naway from the primary tumour, on entering the vasculature, may be transported\nto other organs in which they may establish secondary tumours or metastases\nthat further compromise the host. Invasion is another key feature of solid\ntumours, whereby contact with the host tissue stimulates the production of\nenzymes that digest it, liberating space into which the tumour cells migrate.\nThus, cancer is a complex, multiscale process. The spatial scales of interest range\nfrom the subcellular level to the cellular and macroscopic (or tissue) levels, while\nthe timescales may vary from seconds (or less) for signal transduction pathways\nto months for tumour doubling times.\nIn this paper, we review a number of mathematical models that have been\ndeveloped to describe some of the above aspects of tumour growth. In so doing, we\naim to show how mathematical modelling, computation and analysis can generate\nuseful insight into the mechanisms that underpin this devastating disease. With\nlimited space we are unable to explain the variety of mathematical approaches\nthat are being used: we focus on deterministic models, but recommend a variety of\nreferences for details of alternative approaches (Preziosi 2003; Mantzaris et al.\n2004; Araujo & McElwain 2004; Komarova 2005).\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, we focus on simple\nmodels of angiogenesis and tumour encapsulation, these providing examples of\nmodels that were developed after the associated experiments had been\nperformed. In \u00a73, we consider three-dimensional models of early avascular\ntumour growth and models of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), focusing on the\nexperimental predictions and questions that such work has stimulated. Section 4\ncontinues with applications where the theoretical and experimental work were\ncombined and illustrates the sort of additional insight that such collaboration\ncan generate. The paper concludes in \u00a75 with a brief discussion of the current\nstate-of-the-art in modelling solid tumour growth and of the challenges that lie\nahead.2. Experiments driving theory\nA facet shared by the models presented in this section is that they were\ndeveloped after the relevant experiments had been performed and\/or hypotheses\ndeveloped. Even so, they illustrate an important feature that realistic\nmathematical models should possess: the ability to reproduce data and, in so\ndoing, to provide possible explanations of observed phenomena. We start by\nreviewing models of tumour angiogenesis (for more details, see Mantzaris et al.\n2004) and then discuss a model of tumour encapsulation.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1565Modelling cancer dynamics: a review(a ) Tumour-induced angiogenesis\nThe earliest continuum models of tumour angiogenesis focused on three key\nphysical variables: a generic tumour-derived chemical, termed a tumour\nangiogenesis factor (TAF), capillary tips and capillary sprouts. The one-\ndimensional model developed by Balding & McElwain (1985) consisted of three\npartial differential equations that were derived by applying the principle of mass\nbalance to each species. The capillary tips were assumed to move by chemotaxis\ntowards the TAF source, the tumour, and to emanate from existing vessels or\ntips at rates that increased with the TAF concentration. Capillary tips were lost\nas a result of fusion with other tips and vessels (anastomosis). The production of\ncapillary sprouts was assumed to be driven by tip migration, the sprout density\nincreasing at a rate that matched the flux of capillary tips (the \u2018snail-trail\u2019). The\nTAF was modelled as a diffusible chemical that was produced by the tumour,\nunderwent natural decay and was consumed by the migrating capillary tips.\nStimulated by more detailed knowledge of the biochemistry involved, Levine\net al. (2001) have developed highly complex models that represent an important\nstep towards understanding angiogenesis using biochemical rather than\nphenomenological arguments. Their models account for interactions between\nendothelial cells, angiogenic factors and other cell types that are also involved in\nangiogenesis. The various models exhibit many features of angiogenesis that are\nobserved in vivo (Muthukkaruppan et al. 1982). For example, simulations of\nsuccessful angiogenesis show an accelerating front of capillary tips and sprouts\nmigrating towards the tumour with the maximum capillary density preceding the\nmaximum capillary sprout density (Byrne & Chaplain 1995b).\nExtending Balding & McElwain\u2019s model to two and three spatial dimensions\n(Orme & Chaplain 1997) highlights the shortcomings of using a continuum\nframework to study angiogenesis. First, angiogenesis is a multi-dimensional\nprocess, with tips sprouting in directions other than that of the propagating\nvascular front. Hence, it is not obvious how the \u2018snail-trail\u2019 approach should be\nextended to higher spatial dimensions. In addition, the models do not distinguish\nbetween different vascular morphologies (a region perfused by one large vessel is\nequivalent to another region perfused by many small vessels) or between\nanastomosis (which increases nutrient supply) and capillary tip death (which\ndoes not). Finally, vascular remodelling and the impact of blood flow (and\nhaematocrit) on the evolving vasculature are neglected. Only by developing the\nsimple, one-dimensional models of angiogenesis do such problems come to light\nand stimulate the design of new models that address these deficiencies.\nFortunately, several such models are now being developed. For example, Chaplain\nand co-workers have developed a continuum-discrete model, in which movement\nof the vessel tips is modelled using a biased random walk (Anderson & Chaplain\n1998), and blood flow through the vessels is included (McDougall et al. 2002).\nIn spite of their weaknesses, the continuum models provide useful insight into\nthe ways in which different physical mechanisms influence angiogenesis. In\nparticular, the success of angiogenesis is tightly controlled by the balance\nbetween endothelial cell proliferation and migration: as the strength of the\nchemotactic response increases, the tips migrate more rapidly towards the\ntumour, reducing the time available for tip proliferation, and hence the vascular\ndensity when they reach the tumour.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nH. M. Byrne and others1566(b ) Tumour encapsulation\nMany benign tumours are surrounded by a rim of collagenous connective\ntissue, whose presence is an integral determinant of prognosis, and yet the\nmechanisms by which the capsule forms remain to be elucidated fully. Two\ncomplementary theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon (Barr\n1989). The \u2018Expansive Growth Hypothesis\u2019 (EGH) postulates that capsule\nformation is a passive process: as the tumour expands, it compresses the collagen\nin the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). By contrast, the \u2018Foreign Body\nHypothesis\u2019 (FBH) suggests that capsule formation is an active process: the host\nrecognizes the cancer as a foreign body and mounts an immune response by over-\nexpressing collagen. While it is difficult to discriminate between the hypotheses\nusing experimental techniques, mathematical modelling provides a natural\nframework by which to compare the two alternatives.\nJackson & Byrne (2002) developed such a model by viewing the tumour\u2013host\nenvironment as a mixture of three phases: the cellular phase comprises tumour\ncells, the ECM phase and the aqueous phase consist primarily of water and\ndissolved extracellular tissue components. Mass and momentum balance\nequations are derived for each phase and closed by specifying constitutive\nrelations for various features, including the stresses that develop within the\nphases and the net rates at which they are produced. The FBH is incorporated by\nassuming that the ECM production rate is an increasing function of the tumour\ncell density, with constant of proportionality aR0. The EGH is included by\nassuming that the pressure in the ECM includes a contribution that increases as\nthe tumour cell density increases, with constant of proportionality qR0. Since\nspecies tend to move down pressure gradients, this pressure will drive ECM\nmotion away from regions of high tumour cell density and, thereby, concentrate\nECM near the tumour boundary. Numerical simulations of the full system with\nboth hypotheses active confirm that the model can generate a capsule ahead of\nthe invading tumour (see figure 1). The ECM capsule is preserved in simulations\nhaving aZ0!q and disappears when qZ0!a (results not shown). These\nresults suggest that the EGH provides a more plausible explanation of tumour\nencapsulation than the FBH.3. Theory driving experiments\nHere, we review theoretical models that were developed without relevant data,\nbut are useful nonetheless because they raise questions and yield predictions that\nstimulate biomedical researchers to design new experiments that will validate\n(or refute) the theoretical predictions.\n(a ) The growth of multicellular spheroids\nThe majority of models of solid tumour growth are based on mass balance\nprinciples for cells and reaction\u2013diffusion equations for growth factors (see Araujo\n& McElwain 2004 for a review). The main challenges involved in developing such\nmodels are describing how the tumour cells move, divide and die and how the\nvarious chemicals diffuse, are produced and absorbed by the tumour cells.

The tumour and ECM profiles are\nplotted at equally spaced time intervals (tZ0; 10; 20;.; 60, with t increasing from left to right in all\npanels) and for two choices of the parameter values: (a) and (b) show the tumour and ECM profiles\nfor the first simulation, while (c) and (d) show the corresponding profiles for the second simulation.\nIn both cases, the tumour invades the ECM (a and c) and the ECM responds by developing a dense\nband ahead of the invading tumour front (for details, see Jackson & Byrne 2002). (Reproduced with\npermission.)\n1567Modelling cancer dynamics: a reviewattention was focused on the one-dimensional growth of a single population of\ntumour cells of constant density. Mathematical models of this type usually\ncomprise reaction\u2013diffusion equations for the distribution within the tumour of\nchemicals of interest (e.g. oxygen, glucose or cytotoxic drugs) and an integro-\ndifferential equation characterizing the tumour\u2019s volumetric growth rate\n(Greenspan 1972; McElwain & Morris 1978; Adam 1987). Such models have\nenjoyed considerable success, reproducing the multilayered patterns observed in\nmulticellular spheroids cultured in vitro (Folkman & Hochberg 1973; Sutherland\n1988), i.e. an outer rim of nutrient-rich, proliferating cells, a central core of\nnutrient-starved, necrotic debris and an intermediate region of nutrient-poor,\nquiescent cells. The models also yield experimentally testable predictions. For\nexample, Byrne & Chaplain (1998) showed that following the onset of centralPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nH. M. Byrne and others1568necrosis, the tumour\u2019s overall size remains approximately fixed while the size of\nthe necrotic region increases rapidly, a prediction that was confirmed in\nindependent experiments (Groebe & Mueller-Klieser 1996).\nUnfortunately, not all tumours undergo one-dimensional growth and they may\nbe heterogeneous, containing, for example, ECM, immune cells and blood vessels.\nThese observations stimulated demand for three-dimensional models that\naccount for cellular heterogeneity.\nSince the early models (Greenspan 1972; McElwain & Morris 1978) do not\ngeneralize readily to higher spatial dimensions, new models were needed\n(Greenspan 1976; Byrne & Chaplain 1996). These models introduced the inter-\nrelated concepts of cell movement and pressure: pressure gradients, generated by\ndifferences in cell proliferation and death, cause cells to move from regions of high\ncell proliferation and pressure (near the tumour periphery) to regions of net cell\ndeath and lower pressure (at the tumour centre). Complete specification of the\nmodels necessitated the introduction of constitutive laws to characterize the\nmechanical properties of the tumour. In the absence of relevant data, Darcy\u2019s law\nwas used in both models to relate the cell velocity to the pressure. A key\ndifference between the two models concerns the mechanism that maintains the\ntumour as a compact mass. Greenspan (1976) invoked surface tension, whereas\nByrne & Chaplain (1998) invoked cell\u2013cell adhesion, assuming that cells on the\nboundary require additional nutrient to maintain the tumour\u2019s compactness and\nthat this would create a jump in the nutrient concentration there. In spite of this\ndifference, both models yielded similar qualitative predictions: if surface tension\nor cell\u2013cell adhesion is strong enough, then stable, one-dimensional growth\noccurs. For smaller values of these parameters, one-dimensional growth will not\npersist and irregular structures, resembling infiltrative invasion, emerge. These\nresults suggest that genetic mutations that weaken the bonds of cell\u2013cell\nadhesion or reduce surface tension could explain why certain tumours possess\nhighly irregular, fractal-like outer boundaries. Experiments are now needed to\nestablish whether either of the postulated mechanisms is dominant in tumour\nspheroids.\nThere is increasing evidence that mechanical effects influence tumour growth.\nFor example, when they embedded tumour spheroids in gels of different\nstiffnesses, Helmlinger et al. (1997) found that the size to which the spheroids\ngrew decreased as the stiffness of the gel increased. Such results have prompted\nthe development of sophisticated multiphase models (Chen et al. 2001; Jackson &\nByrne 2002; Byrne et al. 2003) and led to predictions including the possible\ncorrelation of cell size with stress levels inside the tumour (Roose et al. 2003).\nWhen developing these models, consideration of cell-to-cell mechanical\ninteractions is required and constitutive laws such as Darcy\u2019s law or Stokes\u2019\nflow must be employed. Once again, validation of these models requires\nexperimental work to characterize the mechanical behaviour of the different\nspecies and how they interact.(b ) Ductal carcinoma in situ\nDuctal carcinoma in situ represents the initial growth stage of breast cancer,\nduring which the tumour is non-invasive, being confined by the duct. The duct is\ncomposed of a central lumen, surrounded by a thin layer of epithelial cells, withPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1569Modelling cancer dynamics: a reviewan outer basement membrane (the duct wall) which is made of a network of\nproteins. DCIS occurs when epithelial cells that have undergone a malignant\ntransformation proliferate. Sustained tumour cell proliferation in the duct\nincreases the outward pressure on the basement membrane. If accompanied by\nthe local production of proteases, this may cause the membrane to yield and\nenable the tumour cells to invade the tissue (Brummer et al. 1999).\nWhile the literature is now replete with models addressing all aspects of solid\ntumour growth, little attention has been devoted to DCIS. Xu (2004) studied an\nexisting tumour growth model (Byrne & Chaplain 1995a) in a radially\nsymmetric, cylindrical geometry, and noted that the spatial patterns (spots,\nstripes and uniform distributions) exhibited by stationary model solutions were\nconsistent with morphologies commonly observed in DCIS (e.g. cribriform,\ncomedo and papillary). In the paper by Xu (2004), nutrient diffusion limits\ntumour growth, the duct wall is rigid and tumour properties such as the local\ncellular density and pressure are neglected. Franks and co-workers developed\nnew models that include these features (Franks et al. 2003, 2004, 2005). The\nresulting models involve coupling existing models of avascular tumour growth in\na cylindrically symmetric tube with mechanical models for the finite deformation\nof the compliant membrane that confines the tumour, the coupling being\nmediated by interactions between the expansive forces created by tumour cell\nproliferation and the stresses that develop in the compliant membrane (Epstein &\nJohnston 2001).\nThe models provide insight into DCIS progression and also generate several\nhypotheses that could be tested experimentally. For example, the pressure on the\nduct wall is likely to be greatest at the centre of the tumour and, hence, this is\nwhere the duct wall is likely to be breached (Franks et al. 2003). The model is\nalso used to test two hypotheses for the localization, near the duct wall, of\nproteases that compromise its integrity. Model simulations and asymptotic\nanalysis suggest that the elevated pressure that accompanies tumour growth is\nmore likely to stimulate protease production and localization near the duct wall\nthan hypoxia (Franks et al. 2005).\nWhile several interesting predictions arise from the theoretical work,\ncomplementary experiments are now needed to determine the mechanical\nproperties of the duct wall and to validate the predictions. Thus, the models of\nDCIS illustrate how qualitative insight into a particular system can be\ngenerated, even in the absence of relevant data, and how theoretical studies\nmay prompt future experimental work.4. Experiments and theory: synergy\nIn \u00a7\u00a72 and 3, the models and experiments were effectively independent, with the\nexperiments preceding the theory (\u00a72) or the theory stimulating new experiments\n(\u00a73). It is natural to ask whether additional insight can be gained when\nexperiments and theory are combined. Consequently, we now focus on studies\nwhich illustrate the benefits that may accrue when experimentalists and\ntheoreticians collaborate. We start by considering anti-angiogenic therapies\nand then discuss a new therapy involving genetically engineering a patient\u2019s\nmacrophages to achieve localized cell killing in certain tumour regions.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nH. M. Byrne and others1570(a ) Tumour response to anti-angiogenic treatments\nIn the paper by Hahnfeldt et al. (1999), data from tumour-bearing mice\ntreated with a range of angiogenic inhibitors are presented with a theoretical\nmodel of tumour growth in response to (tumour-derived) angiogenic stimulators\nand inhibitors (the drugs). By combining their theoretical and experimental\nwork, Hahnfeldt and co-workers were able to use their model to quantify the\neffectiveness of different antiangiogenic agents. They were also able to predict\nconditions under which a tumour will attain a fixed size that is independent of its\nsize at the start of treatment, this being the case when the anti- and pro-\nangiogenic factors are in balance. A further advantage of the model developed\nthere is that it could be adapted and applied to a clinical setting.\nThe above model was extremely simple, involving ordinary differential\nequations for the tumour mass and the perfusing vasculature (the drug\nconcentration was prescribed and targeted the vasculature directly). Recently,\nArakelyan et al. (2005) have developed a complex, multiscale model of vascular\ntumour growth that accounts for vessel maturation and the regression of\nimmature and mature vessels, phenomena that depend on growth factors, such as\nVEGF and the angiopoietins and pericytes. Model simulations suggest that rapid\ntumour growth will occur when the vessel maturation rate is high, due to the\nrapid increase in vessel density that this causes. By contrast, the model also\npredicts that lower vessel maturation rates in tumours with lower background\nvessel densities will create slower growing tumours that possess larger\nproportions of immature vessels and may exhibit oscillatory growth dynamics\n(when the immature vessels regress, perfusion is limited and a new cycle of\nangiogenesis stimulated). Experimental results confirm the model predictions\nand, used in combination with the mathematical model, strengthen the\nhypothesis that variations in tumour growth rates may be strongly influenced\nby the strength of the angiogenic response elicited in the tumour environment.\n(b ) Novel anti-cancer therapies\nIncreased understanding of how different solid tumours grow means that it is\nnow possible to design patient-specific treatment protocols. Even so, certain\ntumour sites, in particular hypoxic regions, remain notoriously difficult to target\nwith existing therapies. Hypoxic regions are usually furthest from the blood\nvessels that perfuse the tissue, hampering drug delivery. Furthermore, tumour\ncells respond to hypoxia by slowing their rate of proliferation, so that anti-\nproliferative therapies will have minimal effect there. Hypoxic tumour cells are\nalso potent sources of angiogenic factors such as VEGF.\nA possible solution to this problem is linked to the observation that\nmacrophages localize in hypoxic regions of many tumours, particularly breast.\nA new therapy using genetically engineered macrophages exploits their tendency,\nwhen reinjected into the patient, to migrate preferentially to low oxygen regions\nwhere they are activated to release anti-tumour drugs. Particularly, the low\noxygen levels that characterize solid tumours are peculiar to tumours and not\nusually observed in other organs. Hence, the therapy promises increased tumour\nspecificity, with reduced side-effects.\nPreliminary results are promising, showing up to 30% reduction in the size of\navascular tumours treated with appropriately engineered macrophages (GriffithsPhil.

In each case, cell death is localized near\nto the tumour periphery, where cell proliferation is greatest, yielding a response similar to that for\nconventional chemotherapy (for details, see Webb et al. submitted).\n1571Modelling cancer dynamics: a reviewet al. 2000). Many questions remain to be answered before this approach can be\nused routinely. Of particular interest is establishing where cell kill occurs when\nengineered macrophages are used. In order to address this issue, models of\nmacrophage infiltration into tumour spheroids growing either in vitro (in free\nsuspension) or in vivo (in healthy tissue) have been developed (Owen et al. 2004;\nWebb et al. submitted). In these models, it is important to describe precisely how\nthe macrophages exert their influence. In one approach currently under\ninvestigation, the macrophages produce an enzyme under hypoxia. The enzyme\nconverts to active form a pro-drug, which is injected separately. When these\nfeatures are incorporated into models of spheroid growth in vitro, cell kill is\nlocalized towards the tumour periphery, where the proliferation rate is highest\n(see figure 2). Since a similar response would result on application of a\nconventional drug that targets proliferating cells, it is natural to question the\nvalue of such an elaborate treatment. Fortunately, results from in vivo\nsimulations indicate that the engineered macrophages may be beneficial when\nused to treat patients, as they predict reduced toxicity (see figures 3 and 4).\nThe benefit of combining the experimental and theoretical endeavours should\nnow be clear: on the basis of the in vitro results alone, the macrophage therapy\nmight be dismissed since it appears to act in the same way as conventional\ntherapies. However, the models show that in vivo the therapy has significant\nbenefits, in terms of enhanced tumour specificity and weaker side-effects.5.

Series of profiles showing how a region of healthy (avascular) tissue in which a tumour\nhas been implanted responds to conventional chemotherapy that is delivered to the region from a\nblood vessel located on the right-hand side of the spatial domain (for details, see Webb et al.\nsubmitted). Since the drug targets proliferating cells, it destroys much of the healthy tissue before\nreaching the tumour site, enabling the tumour to invade unhindered through the region. Solid lines\nrepresent cell densities, dashed lines represent cell death rates.\nH. M. Byrne and others1572mean that it is practically impossible to deduce how the different mechanisms\ninteract by intuition alone. Through the development of well-founded theoretical\nmodels of solid tumour growth, such as those reviewed in this article, we believe\nthat mathematics, in conjunction with related experimental work, can be a\nvaluable tool with which to address such questions.\nThere is now a large literature devoted to modelling solid tumour growth.\nEven so, many issues remain to be resolved. For example, existing models tend to\nfocus on generic tumours and relatively few are specialized to specific tumours\nsuch as gliomas (Swanson et al. 2003) or DCIS (Franks et al. 2005). Further,\nexisting models typically focus on a single spatial scale. As a result, they are\nunable to address the fundamental problem of how phenomena at different scales\nare coupled or to combine, in a systematic manner, data from the various scales\n(Alarcon et al. 2004a; Arakelyan et al. 2005). Alarcon et al. (2004a) formulated a\nhybrid cellular automaton that contains interlinked elements that describe\nprocesses at each spatial scale: progress through the cell cycle (Alarcon et al.\n2004b) and the production of angiogenesis factors are accounted for at the\nsubcellular level; cell\u2013cell interactions are treated at the cellular level; and, at the\ntissue scale, attention focuses on the vascular network, whose structure adapts in\nresponse to blood flow and angiogenic factors produced at the subcellular level.Phil.

Solid lines represent cell densities, dashed lines represent\ncell death rates.\n1573Modelling cancer dynamics: a reviewFurther coupling between the different spatial scales arises from the transport of\nblood-borne oxygen into the tissue and its uptake at the cellular level. The model\nis undoubtedly complex and yields many predictions that warrant experimental\nvalidation. For example, the simulations presented in figure 5 indicate that an\naccurate description of blood flow and, hence, oxygen delivery to the tumour is\nimportant if realistic models of this form are to be developed: if oxygen is\ndistributed uniformly through the vasculature, the tumour grows as a compact\nmass, expanding radially outwards. By contrast, when oxygen is distributed\nheterogeneously through the vasculature, the tumour\u2019s growth is localized in\nregions of high oxygen.\nMultiscale modelling is a huge challenge for mathematicians. Given that it is\nnow recognized that the traditional \u2018top-down\u2019 approach to modelling in the life\nsciences does not make full use of the huge amount of data being generated\nexperimentally, there is a move to model \u2018bottom-up\u2019. However, here we have to\nbe careful that we do not simply replace the biological system we are trying to\nunderstand by a huge computational model that we have no chance of ever\nunderstanding! One way forward is to develop \u2018toy\u2019 models at one level that are\nthen used as input at another level. For example, if we wish to understand how\nregulation of the HIF-1a pathway leads to tissue growth under hypoxic\nconditions, we need first to write down the detailed biochemical pathwaysPhil. Trans.

Series of profiles showing how the pattern of tumour invasion depends on the way in\nwhich the vessels deliver oxygen to the tissue (for details, see Alarcon et al. 2004a). When the\noxygen is distributed uniformly through the vasculature (lower figures), the tumour grows as a\ncompact, almost circular mass and eventually colonizes the entire tissue. When the oxygen is\ndistributed heterogeneously (upper figures), the tumour\u2019s growth is more irregular and confined to\nthose regions of the tissue where oxygen levels are highest. In panels (a), (b), (d) and (e), white\nspaces represent tumour cells and black spaces are either empty or occupied by vessels. Panels (c)\nand (f ) show the time evolution of the number of cancer cells for non-uniform and uniform oxygen\ndistribution, respectively. The upper curves (squares) represent the total number of cancer cells\n(proliferating and quiescent) and the lower curves (diamonds) represent the number of quiescent\ntumour cells. In both simulations, the normal cells are rapidly eliminated by the tumour\npopulation, and therefore do not appear. (Reproduced with permission.)\nH. M. Byrne and others1574regulating HIF, understand them and then derive, using, for example, multi-\ntimescale approaches and coarse-graining, a simple model which can be linked to\na model for how HIF upregulates VEGF production and hence angiogenesis, and\nhow this increases nutrient delivery leading to increased tissue growth. The\ndetailed modelling at the biochemical level will allow us to address issues, such as\nwhich pathway might be the key one to attack from a therapeutic point of view,\nbut will have limited value in a whole organ model. Thus, we really need to\ndevelop a suite of models which are used to answer different questions. Of course,\na key problem here will be to ensure that in simplifying the model we still capture\nall the salient features. This will require using intra- as well as interdisciplinary\nresearch approaches, for example, using perturbation analysis of ordinary\ndifferential equations, and Boolean network or topological approaches, to make\nsure that we fully understand the regulatory network being studied.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1575Modelling cancer dynamics: a reviewMathematical and computational modelling have a number of roles to play in\ncancer research, and we have chosen in this review to focus on certain models\nwhich illustrate each of these roles. For example, the first model that anyone\ndevelops (usually the experimentalist) is a \u2018word\u2019 model, that is, the assumption\nthat a limited set of processes combine to produce an observed phenomenon. The\nverbal reasoning used to manipulate such word models is necessarily linear.\nHowever, most biological interactions are nonlinear, and the natural medium for\nmanipulating such ideas is mathematics. Therefore, one role of a mathematical\nmodel is to verify hypotheses and we have given a number of examples of this in\nthe present paper. Modelling can also help to develop our intuition and to\nunderstand what appear to be counter-intuitive results.\nOther roles of modelling are to generate hypotheses and to make predictions,\nand, again, we have illustrated a number of such examples above. However, this\nis as far as a model can go. There must be an iteration between modelling and\nexperiment, where theoreticians develop models based on in-depth discussion\nwith experimentalists, who, in turn, test the predictions of the model. Based on\nthese results, the model is refined and the iteration continues, allowing us\nhopefully to converge to a full understanding of the phenomenon at hand. This is\nan example of the type of interdisciplinary research discussed in the paper by\nWelsh et al. (2006). However, a disappointing aspect of cancer research thus far\nhas been the lack of experimental testing of model predictions (Komarova 2005).\nThis arises mainly because the groups doing theory and those doing experiment\nare not embedded with each other. This was one of the prime motivations for us\nto develop the Integrative Biology programme (discussed in the paper by Welsh\net al. (2006), and in which both Byrne and Maini are co-investigators) directly to\naddress this problem. The benefits of such an interaction are very apparent. In\n1996, Gatenby and Gawlinski developed a mathematical model for the acid-\nmediated invasion hypothesis for tumour spread. The model predicted that under\ncertain circumstances a gap would arise between the advancing tumour front and\nthe regressing normal tissue (Gatenby & Gawlinski 1996). As Gatenby is himself\na clinician, he was able to test this prediction and show it to be true.\nUnfortunately, few individuals have access to both the theoretical know-how and\nthe experimental equipment to work in this way, and once again this highlights\nthe need for a new way to do science (Komarova 2005; Welsh et al. 2006).\nIn conclusion, in this article we have explained why we believe theoretical\nmodelling has an important role to play in advancing our understanding of solid\ntumour growth in particular and medicine in general. We hope that in the future,\nas these benefits become more widely recognized, mathematicians will be\nroutinely involved in the design and analysis of experimental work.Editors\u2019 note\nPlease see also related communications in this focussed issue by Pinter & Shohet\n(2006) and Schaller & Meyer-Hermann (2006).\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge support from the EU Research Training Network (5th\nFramework): \u2018Using mathematical modelling and computer simulation to improve cancer therapy\u2019\n(TA) and the EPSRC (via an advanced research fellowship, HMB).Phil.
