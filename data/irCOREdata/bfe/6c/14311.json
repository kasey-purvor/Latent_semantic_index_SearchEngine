Introduction\nCurrent hypermedia learning environments do not have a common development basis.\nTheir designers have often used ad-hoc solutions to solve the learning problems they have\nencountered. However, hypermedia technology can take advantage of employing a\ntheoretical scheme - a model - which takes into account various kinds of learning\nactivities, and solves some of the problems associated with its use in the learning process.\nThe model can provide designers with the tools for creating a hypermedia learning system,\nby allowing the elements and functions involved in the definition of a specific application\nto be formally represented.\nThis paper outlines some basic principles of computer-supported learning and the problems\nrelated to the use of hypermedia learning systems. It then summarizes a number of\nhypermedia and electronic-books models, which represent the basis for the development of\nthe theoretical model presented later, and it describes CESAR, a hypermedia learning\nenvironment for hearing-impaired children which is based on this model. Lastly, it reports\nsome conclusions drawn from the definition of the model and the development of CESAR.\n2. Learning and hypermedia\nHypermedia systems, being non-linear nets of information, offer a representation similar\nto human knowledge, and can thus be considered as useful learning tools. However,\n4\nALT-) Volume 5 Number 3\nhypermedia efficiency in computer-aided environments is not proved, nor is hypermedia\ndevoid of problems (Reader and Hammond, 1994), a common one being related to a user's\nability to navigate freely within the information offered. This problem suggests that there\nshould be a change in the design of hypermedia courseware [7], with a view to imposing\nsome navigation constraints. On the one hand, unnecessary links must be avoided. On the\nother hand, as Haga and Nishino (1995) suggest, students should be prevented from\nexcessively deepening their knowledge of a subject, considering three as the maximum\nnumber of levels (depth of hyperlinks) that should be allowed. Structuring information can\nbe considered as being contrary to the hypermedia philosophy, but students can still\nbenefit from structured courseware. For example, Beltran (1993) proposes a courseware\nstructure made up of courses, examples and practice. Courses will include information\nabout the main subjects; examples will be particular or simplified cases related to the\ncourses; and practice will consist of problems and presentations which require a creative\ninvolvement.\nAnother problem is that of determining the kinds of tasks to be provided to the student\nand how these activities will integrate into the learning process. A computer-aided learning\nsystem might include tasks such as reading, creative writing, problems resolution and self-\nevaluation. Practical tasks may also be required, for instance editing information,\ngathering, annotating and restructuring the material, and marking useful sections (Page,\n1991). In any case, it is important to design an environment which combines\ncomplementary activities, such as active-passive, creative-reactive and directed-\nexplanatory.\nMatching the instructional approach with student learning objectives is yet another\nproblem. Each student's motivation to learn is different. Moreover, society and his\/her\nsocial role are factors that directly influence what, how and when he\/she learns. And other\nimportant issues bear upon student learning such as age, sex, educational level, prior\ntraining, ethnic background, cultural heritage, level of initial motivation, personality and\nphysical abilities (Barker, 1993). The learning style of each student can suddenly change,\nfor example due to his\/her emotions, the type of courseware being used or the current stage\nof a system. Consequently, the environment must be personalized so that the learning\nmethod is adapted to each student's style abilities (Allinson and Hammond, 1990; Barker,\n1993). Some experiments have been based on this idea; an example is AnatomTutor\n(Beaumont and Brusilovsky, 1995), a hypermedia learning system for medicine that is\nadapted to the user's needs using artificial-intelligence techniques.\nA further issue in developing hypermedia systems is the design of the user interface. In fact, a\ngood user interface can help to solve many of the problems stated above. In this respect, the\nuse of metaphors and stories may be appropriate. Metaphors provide a way of encapsulating\nsystem facilities, minimizing the cognitive overhead and maximizing system transparency\nand use (Vaananen, 1995). For example, the book metaphor allows a familiar learning space\nto be created; this kind of metaphor has already been implemented in the ABC Book for\nEarly Learners (Barker and Giller, 1990), a hypermedia system for learning the alphabet.\nEqually, the intrinsic characteristics of stories make them a powerful mechanism for solving\nsome of the hypermedia problems, in particular disorientation and system control. Stories\nalso serve as a natural context where students can acquire and relate knowledge. For instance,\nThe Jasper series (Barron and Kan tor, 1993) uses video tapes of a complex story to show\n5\nIgnado Aedo et al A model for hypermedia learning environments based on electronic books\nmathematical concepts, and Cyber Bunch (Chijn and Plass, 1995) puts together the story and\nbook metaphors to help readers understand German texts.\nThe problems mentioned above, and the advantages of using a book metaphor and a story\nhave been taken into account in developing the model presented in the next section.\n3. Designing hypermedia learning systems\nThis section presents a model, based on the book metaphor and the idea of a story, which\ninherits a number of characteristics from hypermedia and electronic-book models.\n3.1. Hypermedia models\nAccording to the Diccionario de la Lengua Espanola (1992), a model is a theoretical scheme\nof a complex system or reality that facilitates its comprehension and the study of its\nbehaviour(. In particular, a hypermedia model gives unambiguous definitions of the\nelements and relationships needed to represent any application which uses this technology.\nA number of models have been developed, such as HAM, Dexter and Labyrinth, which\nallow designers logically to describe hypermedia applications.\nThe HAM hypermedia model (Campbell and Goodman, 1988; Delisle and Schwartz,\n1996) points up some key features such as version control, the use of filters to retrieve\ninformation, and data control access.\nThe Dexter model (Halasz and Schwartz, 1990; 1994) introduces the concept of anchor\nand separation between nodes and their information. This model has been improved in\norder to take account of collaborative learning environments (Min and Rada, 1993) and\nthe use of multimedia information (Hardman et al, 1993; 1994).\nLabyrinth (Diaz, 1995) is a model for the design of collaborative hypermedia systems that\ndefines seven elements (nodes, links, contents, anchors, users, events and attributes) and a\nset of operations to express both static structure and dynamic behaviour. The model\nseparates the structure (i.e. information holders or nodes) from the contents (i.e.\ninformation pieces), providing information-sharing by reference instead of by copy. This\nfeature also makes possible the assignation of attributes and dynamic behaviour to\nparticular content-items using events, which are independent elements. It generalizes the\nlink definition, allowing distinct kinds of links to be modelled (e.g. bi-directional links,\ncalculated or virtual links, and conditional links). In addition, Labyrinth includes\nmechanisms for controlling access to a hyperdocument by users, be they individuals or\ngroups: constraints can be put on the ability to edit and personalize it, and a control\nversion can be defined, either over the whole hyperdocument or over particular elements of\nit.\nHowever, all such hypermedia models are very general and do not take into account the\nspecific characteristics (elements as well as functionalities) of learning environments.\n3.2. Electronic-book models\nSince the book metaphor appears to be most suitable for presenting electronic books\n(Benest and Duric, 1990; Barker, 1992; Catenazzi, and Sommaruga, 1994), some features\nof electronic-book models must be considered.\n6\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 3\nElectronic books present many features which make them close to hypertext systems.\nHowever, hypertext models are based on the classical definition of hypertext structures (nodes\nand links) rather than on the concept of pages and page components which characterize\nelectronic books. For this reason, it is important to consider models which have been\nexplicitly defined for electronic books. Barker (1992) presents a set of three high-level models,\nincluding a conceptual model, a design model, and a fabrication model. The conceptual\nmodel, intended for the end-user, is composed of a series of pages of reactive and dynamic\ninformation, which support two primary functions: book control and information display.\nThe design and fabrication models are intended for designers and producers of electronic\nbooks. The design model includes the formulation of the end-user interfaces, the book and\npage structure, the content of the book, and the nature of the reader services. The fabrication\nmodel describes the relationships between the various stages of system development, from\nspecification of the content and structure of the book, to the final book distribution.\nThese models are high-level models which describe, from a conceptual point of view,\nseveral aspects of electronic-book production, design and use. A more complete and\nformal model for electronic books is the hyperbook model (Catenazzi and Sommaruga,\n1994), in which an electronic book is seen as an interactive and dynamic system, i.e. a\nsystem which can evolve from one state to another. The hyperbook model is defined in\nterms of structural and functional components. The structural components reflect the\nbook subdivision into pages, and the page subdivision into elements such as text or figures.\nThe functional aspect is indispensable for describing the use of a dynamic and interactive\nsystem. In particular, a number of operators, which represent reader services (e.g.\norientation, navigation, personalization, history and searching), allow a user to change the\nsystem state. This simple model is intuitive, general and easy to extend.\n3.3 A model for hypermedia learning systems\nThe model presented below can be considered as a basis for the development of\nhypermedia learning systems. It offers a common framework where designers will be able\nto develop their systems, focusing on the educational material and on the design of help\nfacilities, and ignoring inherent hypermedia problems.\nThe EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) notation (Sethi, 1989) has been used for the\ndefinition of the model. Items ending with the suffix 'id' are used to identify particular\nattributes of elements. Some elements are not completely specified, since their definition\ndepends on the development of a specific application, and they are therefore formalized for a\nconcrete example in Section 4 below. Table 1 shows the different symbols and their meaning.\nSymbol\n< >\n\u00ab \u00bb\n::=\n(\n{ }\n( )\n[ ]\nDescription\nBegin and end symbols that enclose no terminal elements.\nBegin and end symbols that enclose terminal elements.\nDecomposition symbol, where the left part is made up of the\nelements in the right part\nExclusive symbol (OR).\nRepetition symbol; the elements enclosed are repeated from\n0 to N times.\nAssociative symbol.\nOptionality symbol: the elements enclosed are optional.\nExample\n<item>\n\u00abrtem_id\u00bb\n<item>::= <iteml><item2>\n((ftem_id\u00bb | <item>\n{<item> }\n(\u00abitem_id\u00bb 1 <item>)\n[<item>]\nTable I: EBNF notation\n7\nIgnadoAedo et at A model for hypermedia learning environments based on electronic books\nThe learning environment is defined as a library, with which several users interact, and a\nseries of peripheral elements which support the learning process. The contents are\nindependent elements, so that the same content can be used in different environment\nelements to promote relations among knowledge domains (Page, 1991). Events are relevant\nfacts that occur in the environment. They are defined by the tutor or by the system and\nallow, for example, contents to be synchronized or stimuli to be presented to the students.\nMoreover, the environment components are inter-related. Thus, the learning environment\nis defined by:\n<learning_environment>: <library> (<user> {<user>})\n{<peripheral_element>} (<content> {<content>}) {<events>}\n<relation>\nThis definition supposes that the environment is composed of a library which has at least\none user and one content, and where peripheral elements and events can be included.\nFinally, a set of relations among these elements is defined.\nElements definition\nThe central axis in the environment are the books that are in the library, composed of a\nstory and a set of trainings. The use of the book allows a natural environment to be created\nwhere the student knows where he\/she is, where he\/she can go, and what he\/she can do,\nsince he\/she is familiar with physical books. The library definition is:\n<library> ::= <book>, {<book>}\n<book> ::= ((book_id(( <story> (<training> {<training>})\nThe story must be sequential, beginning with the front cover, followed by several content\npages, and ending with the back cover. According to Haynes's (1990) recommendations,\nintellectual-property information must be included in order to preserve the book copyright.\nEach content page can have tied a set of exercises for each training, which are oriented\ntowards acquiring a particular knowledge or skill. In addition, bookmarks can be added in\nthe content and the copyright pages. The story definition is:\n<story> ::= <front_cover> (<page> {<page>}) <copyright>\n<back_cover>\n<front_cover> : := \u00ab p a g e _ i d \u00bb\n<page> : := \u00ab p a g e _ i d \u00bb { \u00ab t r a i n i n g _ i d \u00bb ( \u00ab e x e r c i s e _ i d \u00bb\n{\u00abexe rc i se_ id\u00bb})} \u00abbookmark\u00bb\n\u00abbookmark\u00bb : := \"true\" ( \"false\"\n<copyright> : : = \u00abpage_id\u00bb \u00abbookmark\u00bb\n<back_cover> : : = \u00abpage_id\u00bb\n8\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 3\nTrainings are used as a learning aid and cover the topics considered relevant by the tutor\n(e.g. mathematics, history). Each one contains exercises for a particular category. For\nexample, in a training of mathematics, there can be exercises of the Real Numbers category.\nThese exercises will fundamentally formulate questions that students will answer using\ndifferent strategies. Strategies give the student the possibility of solving the same exercise\nin different ways, since the presentation (i.e. how contents are shown), the interaction (i.e.\nhow the system will respond to the student interaction) and the assessment (i.e. how to\ndetermine if the answer is correct) can be modified from one strategy to another by the\ntutor or an intelligent system. Each strategy has a simulation that acts as a stimulus and\nindicates how the exercise must be solved. The training composition is:\n<training> ::= \u00abtraining_id\u00bb (<exercise> {<exercise>})\n<exercise> ::= \u00abexercise_id\u00bb (\u00abcategory_id\u00bb\n{\u00abcategory_id\u00bb}) (<strategy> {<strategy>} )\n<strategy> ::= \u00abstrategy_id\u00bb \u00absimulation_id\u00bb <resolution>\n<resolution> ::= <presentation> <interaction> <assessment>\n<presentation> : := \u00abevent_id\u00bb {\u00abevent_id\u00bb}\n<interaction> ::= \u00abevent_id\u00bb {\u00abevent_id\u00bb}\n<assessment> : := \u00abevent_id\u00bb {\u00abevent_id\u00bb}\nFigure 1 resumes the library structure in the model.\nUser is included in the model as a component that must be instanced according to the\nobjectives and characteristics of the concrete system.

They are classified into external elements and tools, according to\nthe activities they support using the taxojd attribute. The first category includes those that\nmainly support explanatory activities. External elements can be, for example, reference\nbooks, dictionaries, and help manuals. The information transfer from\/to the book is made\nby using those tools which support active and creative activities and allow the user to\ndevelop a personal framework. Some examples of tools are notebooks, and calculators.\nThe different peripheral elements are classified using the attribute classjd.\n9\nIgnocio Aedo et o\/ A model for hypermedia learning environments based on electronic books\nFigure I: Library structure\n<peripheral_element> ::= \u00abperipheral_element_id>>\n\u00abtaxo_id\u00bb \u00abclass_id\u00bb <peripheral_element_info>\n\u00abtaxo_id\u00bb ::= \"external_element* \"tool\"\n<peripheral_element_info> ::= Depends on the concrete\nperipheral element.\nThe contents refer to particular information included in the environment.

In addition, events can be used to model any other kind of\nconditional actions, for example to activate a process depending on the system status.

Using the model: the design of CESAR\nCESAR (Aedo et al, 1995) was designed starting from the model presented in the previous\n. section. It is a hypermedia learning environment which aims to help hearing-impaired\nchildren to acquire the necessary skills in sign and written languages. This system will\ninitiate the deaf child to the story structure and will provide him or her with the necessary\nexperience by using stories. In the system description, we include those parts of the model\nwhich have been left open because they are dependent on the specific system and on its\nfunctionalities.\nEach book in the library consists of two parts: the story and the training. A combination\nof different media (text, image, and video) is used to represent'the book contents in both\nparts. Therefore, the content definition is completed by instancing the type of information\nthat can be included:\n\u00ab t y p e _ i d \u00bb : := \"image\" | \" t e x t \" | \"video\"\nThe story is based on the book metaphor and consists of a sequence of pages which can be\nclassified according to three different types. The first one is intended to cover the\ninformation contained in the presentation pages of the story: front and back cover. A front\ncover page is seen in Figure 2, where the video shows a narrator signing the story. The\nsecond one corresponds to those pages which contain information about the book\nproduction and copyright, for example the name of the publisher. The last one contains\nthe story pages. In each page the story is displayed in text, graphic and video forms.\nCESAR has currently one training part, addressed towards learning sign and written\nlanguage. Starting from the model presented in the previous section, from the\n13\nIgnatio Aedo et al A model for hypermedia learning environments based on electronic books\ns\nfigure 2: Front-cover page\nconversations with teachers who are involved in hearing-impaired children's education, and\nfrom the teaching methodology defined in Aedo et al (1994), the global structure of the\ntraining was designed. The training consists of a number of exercises which belong to the\nfollowing categories:\n\u2022 Vocabulary category, which allows the child to extend his\/her vocabulary with the terms\nused in a concrete story;\n\u2022 Understanding Questions category, intended to facilitate the child in the task of\nanalysing and understanding the story contents, either through video, or through the\nwritten text;\n\u2022 Regulators category, which motivates the child toward learning and interiorizing the\nsyntactic structure of the language, by using questions which contain terms such as\nWho, Where, When, What, Which, Why, and How;\n\u2022 Values, Motives, and Consequences category, which allows the child to realize the\nexistence of different social values;\n\u2022 Narrative Structure category, which aims to create a logical internal speech to help a\ndeaf child relate his\/her experience, and interiorize the story contents;\n\u2022 Expressive Elements category, which is useful for enriching information and\ncommunication, independently from the language used to communicate;\n14\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 3\n\u2022 Grammatical Elements category, in which, by using the formal structure of the book,\ndifferent kinds of exercise are defined to help a child incorporate these morpho-\nsyntactic elements in his\/her colloquial language.\nBy instancing the general model, the result is:\n\u00abtraining_id\u00bb : := \"linguistic competence\"\n\u00abcategory_id\u00bb ::= \"vocabulary\" | \"understanding_questions\" |\n\"regulators\" | \"values_motives_conseq\" |\n\"narrative_structure\" | \"expressive_elements\" |\n\"grammatical_eleraents\"\nMore than 50 different strategies have been designed according to the particular contents\nto be presented to the child, and to his\/her specific needs. In Figure 3, an exercise in the\nNarrative Structure category is shown. The exercise consists of three different images that\nthe child has to organize, following the same sequence as they appear in the story.\nFigure 3:An exercise in the Narrative Structure category\n15\nIgnadoAedo et ol A model for hypermedia learning environments based on electronic books\nLearning style takes into account three different levels of the learning process, considering\nthe specific problems of a child in any of these levels, and presenting information\ndepending on the specific level. The three levels are as follows.\n1. The initial level, where the child is still acquiring the phonemes of a language, and where\nhe\/she is not able to read and does not know sign language. Children who belong to this\nlevel are between four and seven years old. Sign language, supported by images, is given\npriority.\n2. The intermediate level, where the process of acquiring the phonemes of the language has\nbeen completed, and the child is in a phase where he\/she is extending his\/her vocabulary\nand creating simple linguistic structures. The child can read, although he\/she has\ndifficulties in understanding, and is starting to know sign language. Children who belong\nto this level are between seven and nine years old. Written text, supported by sign language,\nis given priority.\n3. The highest level, where the child has acquired more linguistic and reading skills but\nneeds to improve and strengthen his\/her linguistic structures. Children who belong to this\nlevel are between 9 and 12 years old. The sign-language text, supported by explanatory\nactivities, is given priority.\nThe child's characteristics have been formalized, maintaining information about his\/her\nname and learning level, and about the operations he\/she is allowed to accomplish with\nrespect to the narrator and the bookmarks. The result of this formalization is:\n<user_inf ormation> :: = <personal_inf o> \u00ablevel\u00bb <command>\n<personal_inf o>: : = \u00abfirst_name\u00bb \u00ablast_name>>\n\u00abfirst_name\u00bb : := String of characters.\n\u00ablast_name\u00bb ::= String of characters.\n\u00ablevel\u00bb ::= \"initial\" ( \"intermediate\" ( \"high\"\n<command> ::= <narration> <bookmark>\n<narration> ::= <repeat_narration> <stop_narration>\n<repeat_narration>: : = \u00ablicence\u00bb\n<stop_narration> : : = \u00ablicence\u00bb\n<bookmark> ::= \u00ablicence\u00bb\nCESAR takes into account the peripheral elements considered in the model. There are two\nkinds of tool to accomplish active and creative activities, which extend the book metaphor\nto include the desktop metaphor: the personal notebook and the drawing-tools box.\n16\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 3\nThe child can write, draw and create animations in the personal notebook, which is unique\nto each child. He\/she can create his\/her own information starting from the book contents,\nthus favouring the learning process and inciting him\/her to use his\/her imagination.\n\u00ab t a x o _ i d \u00bb ::= \"tool\"\n\u00ab c l a s s _ i d \u00bb ::= \"notebook\"\n<peripheral_element_info>: : = \u00ab n o t e _ i d \u00bb {\u00abnote_id\u00bb}\nIn Table 8, the operations which are available in the notebook are listed.\nGoNextNote Go to the next page of the notebook.\nGoPrevNote Go to the previous page of the notebook.\nTable 8:The notebook operations\nThe drawing-tools box offers a number of mechanisms for creating and changing\ninformation in both the personal notebook and in the book.

In addition, each word-entry\ncontains its labial form. The dictionary can be also used as an independent object. Its use is\nrecommended to the children in the intermediate and highest levels.

In particular, the evaluation involved\nthe system functionalities (the ease of use, the navigation tools, etc.), and the learning tools\nprovided by the system (the design of the exercises, the contextualization of the learning\nprocess, etc.).\n5. Conclusions\nThe hypermedia learning-environment model presented in this paper can be used as a basis\nfor designing hypermedia learning systems for a number of reasons.\nFirstly, this model is adaptable. It is possible, for instance, to change the page contents, and\nthus, substantially, the story, maintaining the same logic scheme. It could also be possible\nto achieve different learning objectives with the same story by changing the training.\nSecondly, the use of the book concept in the model allows the main hypermedia problems\nmentioned in Section 2 above to be taken into account and solved in the system-design\nphase. Our experience the development and evaluation of CESAR confirmed that the use\nof the story allows its sequentiality to be employed as a natural way of navigating.\nMoreover, a student takes advantage of working with a known object, the book, in which\nthe services are not limited by the system designer but by the environment itself.\nThirdly, the training allows the child to acquire, assimilate and associate knowledge and\nideas, by doing a number of exercises designed to achieve a specific objective. In CESAR\nevaluation (Aedo et al, 1996), participants confirmed that training is an indispensable\nprocess which supports learning and allows the required competence to be achieved. They\nargue that this is useful not only for learning the written and learning language, but also for\nacquiring knowledge of a subject.\nFourthly, the inclusion in the model of peripheral elements allows the system designers to\ncreate contextualized help which complements the learning process. CESAR evaluation\nconfirmed that it is profitable to use a dictionary which allows a hearing-impaired child to\nacquire new words and concepts, and to employ tools for helping the child develop new\nknowledge and ideas.\nFinally, the model highlights the need for adapting the environment to the learning style of\na child. In a specific system, this adaptation can be accomplished by using techniques such\nas expert systems or frame-oriented systems. These techniques will allow the instructional\nobjective of the system to get close to the learning objective of the child, adapting the\ncontents to the user.\n19\nIgnacio Aedo et al A model for hypermedia learning environments based on electronic books\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Nuria Torra, Pilar Miranda, Mar\u00eda Mart\u00edn, and Rafael Calzada for their help in\nrealizing CESAR.
