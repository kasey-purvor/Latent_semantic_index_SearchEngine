Introduction \n \n Struvite or magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MgNH4PO4\u00b76H2O) scale \ndeposits are causing considerable concern to wastewater treatment operators [1, 2]. The \nproblem is not necessarily a new one as problems due to struvite spontaneous precipitation \nwere first reported as a crust of crystalline material in 1937 in a multiple-stage sludge digestion \nsystem [3]. Often perceived as a nuisance affecting the efficiency of treatment processes and \ncausing maintenance problems [4], the control of struvite deposition has been widely \ninvestigated, including the dilution of struvite crystals with water effluents [5]; preventive \naction by chemical dosing of iron salts [6] or addition of chemical inhibitors [1,7]. In the past \n10 years struvite precipitation has gained interest as a route to phosphorus recovery [1]. Its \ncomposition (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) ions in equal molar \nconcentrations) makes it a potentially marketable product for the fertiliser industry, if the \nproperties of the final product can be controlled [8]. \n \n \n 3\n1.1. Struvite formation \n \n Struvite usually precipitates as stable white orthorhombic crystals in a 1:1:1 molar ratio \naccording to equation 1 (with n= 0, 1, and 2, as a function of pH) [9]:  \nMg2++NH +4 +HnPO\n3\n4\n\u2212n +6H2O \u2192 MgNH4PO4.6H2O+nH+ (1) \n \n The occurrence and development of struvite crystals follows two chemical stages: \nnucleation (crystal birth) and crystal growth (enlargement of crystals until equilibrium) [10]. \nPredicting or controlling these stages is complex as it is controlled by a combination of factors \nincluding thermodynamic of liquid-solid equilibrium, phenomena of matter transfer between \nsolid and liquid phases [10, 11], and kinetics of reaction [12] as well as several physico-\nchemical parameters such as: pH of the solution from which struvite may precipitate, \nsupersaturation, mixing energy, temperature and presence of foreign ions. \n The influence of pH and supersaturation on the precipitation rate and crystal \ncharacteristics of struvite has been demonstrated by a number of authors [12-16], but as yet \nlittle interest has been paid to the influence of foreign ions on struvite nucleation and \ncrystallisation. \nTheoretically speaking, impurities in solution from which a compound may precipitate can \naffect the growth rate of crystals due to blocking of active growth sites inhibiting the increase \nof crystal size, [10]. In the case of struvite crystallisation from wastewater sludge, foreign \ncompounds are numerous (amongst them potassium, chloride, calcium, carbonates, zinc) and \ncould perturb, be absorbed on crystal surfaces and retard struvite formation, hence phosphorus \nbinding [17]. \n 4\nIndeed for a struvite precipitation process to be successful and economically valuable at full \nscale, particular attention has to be paid to the properties and quantity of the final product \nformed. That is to say purity and size of crystal recovered has to be controlled for a reuse as \nfertiliser: the strength of the granule formed has to be sufficient enough for practical reason \n(collection, transport and land filling) while purity is essential for environmental reasons.  \n \n1.2. Influence of calcium and carbonate ions \n \nThe way calcium and carbonate ions could affect struvite nucleation and growth is particularly \nof interest as their levels in wastewater effluent are relatively high. The study published by \nParsons et al., 2001 mentioned magnesium to calcium ratio (Mg:Ca) ranging from 1:1.4 to \n1:3.7 in settled sludge liquors from various wastewater treatment plant in the UK [18]. While it \nis also not unusual to find carbonates (CO \u221223 ) concentrations, (measured in terms of alkalinity, \ni.e. mg\/L as CaCO3) above 200 mg\/L in various streams of sewage treatment works [19]. \nAlthough few authors have studied the influence of calcium and carbonates on struvite \ncrystallisation, it has been showed previously that the presence of calcium (Ca2+) or carbonates \nions (CO \u221223 ) in the media where struvite precipitates can lengthen the induction time preceding \nthe first occurrence of crystals and affect negatively the growth rate [16, 17, 20]. Ca2+ ions \ninteract effectively with phosphate or carbonate ions to form calcium phosphates (in wastewater \nsystems commonly a poorly crystallised hydroxylapatite) or calcium carbonate according to the \nfollowing equations: \n5Ca2+ + 3 \u221234PO  + H2O \u2192  Ca5(PO4)3OH + H+ (2) \nCa2+ + \u221223CO \u2192CaCO3 (3) \n 5\n The presence of Ca ions can influence struvite formation, either by competing for \nphosphate ions or by interfering with the crystallisation of struvite. In the latter case, the \ncharacteristics of struvite crystals formed are likely to be affected; but this has never been \nassessed. The main objective of this paper is thus to explore how Ca ions can affect struvite \ncrystals nucleation and growth, and discuss the impact this has on the quality of the recovered \nproduct. \n \n2. Materials and methods \n \n A series of experiments have been undertaken to assess the impact of Ca ions on struvite \ncrystallisation using absorbance measurements, particle size analysis and the characterisation of \nstruvite crystals formed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy \ncoupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDS). \nFor all the experiments reported here struvite was precipitated from mixed solutions of \nmagnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2\u00b76H2O) and ammonium phosphate (NH4H2PO4). Stock \nsolutions of magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2.6H2O \/ BDH AnalaR) 0.05 M and \nammonium phosphate (NH4H2PO4 \/ Sigma ACS Reagent) 0.2 M were prepared by dissolving \nthe corresponding crystalline compounds in ultra-pure water (Purelab Ultra, Elga). Each stock \nsolution was then filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm paper filter to eliminate the presence of impurities, \nand stored at room temperature. All the experiments mentioned in the present paper have been \nundertaken at room temperature. \n \n \n \n 6\n2.1. pH and absorbance experiments \n \n Initial experiments used changes in solution pH to indicate the start and rate of nucleation. \nExperiments at various initial Mg concentrations were carried out to determine an initial Mg \nconcentration for which the induction period is reasonable and the nature of the crystal formed \nacceptable. \n Struvite was precipitated from volumes of stock solutions MgCl2\u00b76H2O and NH4H2PO4 \ndiluted in 250 mL flasks so that the final concentration of Mg after mixing ranged from 1.2 mM \nto 3.5 mM and the molar ratio of magnesium, nitrogen and phosphorus (Mg:N:P) always equal \n1:2:2. Prior to mixing, the diluted solutions were adjusted to pH 9, by addition of sodium \nhydroxide (analytical reagent grade) 0.01 N and 2 N and then the two solutions were \nsimultaneously mixed together in a 600 mL beaker, and the pH was measured periodically over \n25 minutes. At the end of each test, the precipitate was filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm, dried at \nroom temperature and then characterised via XRD (Powder X-Ray Diffractometer D5005 \nSiemens) and SEM-EDS (Philips XL 30 SFEG). \n The influence of Ca ions on absorbance during struvite crystallisation was investigated at \nconstant initial Mg concentration ([Mg2+] =1.64 mM) and at a wavelength of 385 nm. \nCa ions were added in the Mg chloride solution as Ca chloride dihydrate 0.4M (CaCl2\u00b72H2O \/ \nFisher Chemicals) and carbonates ions were added in the ammonium phosphate solution as \nsodium hydrogen carbonate 0.4M (NaHCO3 \/ AnalaR Fisher Chemicals) to provide alkalinity \nso that the solutions were better analogues to real media (i.e.: wastewater effluents\/sludge \nliquors). The molar ratios Mg:Ca:CO3 investigated were 2:1:1, 1:1:1 and 1:2:2. \n \n \n 7\n2.2. Particle sizing experiments and crystal characterisation \n \n The effects of Ca ions on struvite crystal size, shape and purity were then investigated \nusing particle size analysis, SEM, and XRD. Here a Mastersizer 2000 combined with a Hydro \n2000MU (Malvern instruments) was used to follow changes in particle size distribution during \nstruvite crystallisation in presence of Ca ions. Struvite was precipitated in a 1L beaker from \nequal volumes (400 mL) of MgCl2\u00b76H2O and NH4H2PO4 so that the Mg concentration in the \nfinal solution was 1.64 mM and the ratio of Mg:N:P was 1:2:2. Prior to mixing, various \nvolumes of CaCl2\u00b72H2O 0.4 M were added to the Mg chloride solution, and equal volumes of \nNaHCO3 0.4 M were added in the ammonium phosphate solution. Then each solution was pH \nadjusted to 9 by addition of NaOH. Ratios Mg:Ca:CO3 experimented were 2:1:1, 1:1:1 and \n1:2:2. The particle size distribution was automatically recorded as the experiment progressed. \nAt the end of each experiment, the samples were filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filter, dried at room \ntemperature and analysed with XRD and SEM-EDS. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n3.1 pH \n \n Struvite crystallisation is governed by the combination of key parameters amongst which \nare the pH, the initial concentration of the ionic species in solution, the mixing speed and the \npresence of foreign ions. In order to assess the impact of Ca ions on the quality, that is to say \nhere size, morphology and purity, of struvite crystals, it was necessary to limit the impact of the \nother parameters on crystal formation. Experiments were undertaken at room temperature and \n 8\nat a constant mixing speed. Solutions were made to a standard recipe with the molar ratio \nMg:N:P (1:2:2) leaving the concentration of Mg as the limiting parameter. \n The initial experiments undertaken used pH as an indicator of struvite nucleation. As \nstruvite precipitates, it triggers a release of protons ions in solution and hence a change in pH \noccurs during the nucleation process. The drop in pH is characteristic of the speed at which the \nfirst crystals of struvite occurs, and is linked to the rate of struvite formation which can \ninfluence the quality of the crystals formed. \n The first series of tests measured changes of pH with time for a range of Mg \nconcentrations. It was seen that as expected increasing the concentration of the limiting Mg \nions lead to an increase in the change in pH and a reduction in induction time (Figure 1). XRD \nand SEM were used to characterise the purity and morphology of the produced crystals. Little \ndifference in purity was observed but the morphology of the crystals was influenced by the \ninitial concentration of Mg in solution. When the Mg concentration increases, the \ncharacteristics of struvite crystals is better, that is to say that the typical orthorhombic shape of \nstruvite is more frequent and their size is bigger. From these experiments the Mg concentration \nof 1.64 mM was chosen as a good compromise between induction period and quality of the \nresulting product. \n \n3.2. Effects of Ca ions on absorbance during struvite crystallisation \n \n In addition to pH, absorbance measurements have often been used to follow nucleation \nand growth [21]. The absorbance measurement corresponds to the quantity of energy absorbed \n(or transmitted) by the matter, and hence following the evolution of the absorbance of a \n 9\nsolution at a specific wavelength, we can see the advancement of the crystallisation process and \nhence the evolution of the particle growth. \n Here we have investigated the effect that Mg:Ca ratio has on struvite nucleation and \ngrowth. Without any Ca the absorbance increases quickly (less than 2 minutes) due to the \nnucleation of struvite particles, before reaching a maximum stable value (around 0.170) \ncorresponding to crystal growth and sedimentation stages (Figure 2). By adding Ca at a molar \nratio of Mg:Ca 2:1, we observe an increase in absorbance values, probably due to the formation \nof Ca carbonate or phosphate but we also notice an increase in the induction time from 2 \nminutes to more than 3 minutes. At the higher molar ratios Mg:Ca 1:1, and 1:2, the turbidity of \nthe solution just after mixing is high due to the preferential reaction of Ca ions with carbonate \nor phosphate ions making it difficult to extract data on the formation of struvite crystals. \nAt a molar ratio Mg:Ca 2:1, it appears that an instantaneous precipitation occurs in the early \nstage of the reaction causing the initial turbidity of the solution, but the time taken to reach \nconstant absorbance values is not as quick as it was during the first experiment without Ca. \nDespite this first reaction, some particles continue thus to nucleate. As phosphate ions are \npresent in this case in large excess comparing to calcium, even if the totality of Ca ions react \npreferentially with phosphates to form calcium phosphate, the minimum 1:1:1 Mg:N:P ratio \nnecessary for struvite to occur is still available, this would explain that struvite nucleation is \npossible. At this level, calcium ions could thus affect the rate of growth and the induction time \nas Koutsoukos et al., 2003 mentioned it in their work [17]. At higher molar ratios Mg:Ca 1:1, \nand 1:2, the results are more difficult to interpret as although the turbidity of the solution just \nafter mixing is high due to the preferential reaction of Ca ions with carbonate or phosphate \nions, making it difficult to extract data from absorbance measure on the formation of struvite \ncrystals. To understand what happens in those cases in terms of crystal formation and\/or \n 10\ncharacteristics of the compound generated, analysis of the recovered product was necessary. To \nclarify these first statements the following experiments concerning particle sizing and crystal \ncharacterisation were carried out.  \n \n3.3 Particle sizing experiments and crystals characterisation \n \n To determine the influence of Ca ions at higher concentrations, and to investigate their \neffect on the struvite crystal properties, it was decided to undertake a series of experiments \nusing particle sizing, XRD and SEM-EDS. Particle size measurements were performed \ncontinuously at constant speed (Vr= 2500 rpm) during the precipitation process and the particle \nsize was recorded over periodic intervals. Again changes in particle size were followed for a \nrange of Mg:Ca ratios. As a reference the change in particle size in a solution without added Ca \nwas measured and the data obtained showed a monomodal particle size distribution for all the \ndistributions, with a mean size rising to constant values comprised between 13.416 and 15.157 \n\u03bcm after 5 minutes of experiment (Figure 3, Figure 4). \n The effects of Ca concentration on the evolution of struvite particle size are showed here \nby plotting the particle size distribution at the beginning (T=5 min) and the end (T=20 min) of \nthe experiment. An increase of the Ca concentration in relation to the Mg concentration results \nin a decrease of the mean size measured after 5 minutes run: maximum peaks are recorded \nbetween 2.15 \u03bcm to 2.429 \u03bcm for the ratio 2:1, 2.745 \u03bcm to 3.101 \u03bcm for the ratio 1:1 and \n3.958 \u03bcm to 4.472 \u03bcm for the ratio 1:2. After 20 minutes run, the results are different. The \ndistribution in presence of Ca ions at low concentration (ratio Mg:Ca 2:1) appears with a \nmaximum peak corresponding to a mean size of particle lower than for the run without Ca. At \nhigher Ca concentrations (ratios 1:1, and 1:2), the data showed a rise in the population of \n 11\nparticles with higher mean size (Figure 4) than for the results without Ca addition. This may \nindicate an agglomeration of the particles so that the percentage of individual particles \ndecreases compared to the agglomerates. SEM pictures taken of dried samples recovered at the \nend of each trial helped to explain this supposition. \n Firstly, the XRD pattern generated from the sample without Ca matched with the database \nmodel for struvite (i.e. position and intensity of the peaks, figure 5, sample 1), identifying the \nprecipitate to be struvite [19]. But as Ca concentration increases (Mg:Ca 2:1, figure 5, sample \n2), XRD results showed a more noisy pattern with reduction in peak size and definition. At \nhigher Ca concentrations the analysis revealed only background noise, indicating that there was \nno macro crystalline compound present in the samples (Figure 5, XRDs of samples 3 and 4). \nSEM confirmed the results of the particle size experiments and XRD analysis in that the \nformation of struvite crystals (Figure 5, picture sample 1) is affected by the presence of Ca ions. \nAt a low calcium concentration in solution, we can still distinguish the shape of struvite particle \nbut covered by a precipitate (Figure 5, picture sample 2) whilst a rise to higher Ca \nconcentration inhibits the occurrence of struvite crystals and leads to the formation an \namorphous matter (Figure 5, pictures sample 3 and 4), probably a calcium phosphate \ncompound. To identify the elemental composition of this amorphous matter, energy dispersive \nspectrometry has been used on specific area localised on the SEM pictures. \nAs expected for samples without Ca, EDS spectrum (Figure 6, Sample1) showed highest peaks \nwere obtained for Mg, P and O (i.e.: major elements composing struvite in mass percentage), \nconfirming the purity of the crystal formed as no traces of other compounds have been found. \nAt a Mg:Ca ratio of 2:1, EDS performed on struvite like crystals covered with an amorphous \nsubstance, showed the presence of a distinctive peak for Ca while peaks for Mg and P were \nquasi unchanged (Figure 6, Sample2 A). We can say that at this level another phase precipitates \n 12\non struvite crystal surfaces and around, hence starting to interact with its formation. It is more \nthan just calcium which is absorbed on the surface of struvite crystals. An EDS analysis \nperformed on an amorphous part next to the crystal like shape in the same sample (Figure 6, \nSample2 B) revealed a higher peak for Ca and an important peak for phosphorus when \ncompared to the magnesium. The formation of this precipitate at the surface of crystals would \nthus explain the multitude of background noises observed previously on the XRD patterns \n(Figure 5, sample2) while struvite peaks are still identifiable.  \nAt Mg:Ca 1:1 and above (Figure 6, samples 3 and 4), the EDS spectrum of this amorphous \nmatter reinforce the first hypothesis that the precipitate formed at this stage is due to the \nformation of an amorphous calcium phosphate. Indeed both spectra show prominent peaks for \nphosphorus and calcium when compared to magnesium. From a first point of view, we could \nhave identified it as either an amorphous calcium phosphate or another calcium phase (i.e. \ncalcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide), but in the latter case XRD pattern for samples 2 to 4 \nwould have showed them on Figure 5, as they are crystalline substances. This confirms thus \nthat the chemical nature of this matter is easily assimilated as an amorphous calcium phosphate. \n \n4. Conclusion \n \nThe impact of Mg and Ca solution concentrations on struvite crystallisation has been \ninvestigated using a range of analytical tools including pH, absorbance, particle size, XRD and \nSEM-EDS.  \nIt has been shown that the presence of Ca ions in solution has a significant impact on struvite \ncrystallisation in terms of size shape and purity of the product recovered. In the present study, it \nhas been found that increasing the calcium concentration reduces the crystal size and inhibits \n 13\nthe struvite growth, or affects struvite crystallisation and leads to the formation of an \namorphous substance rather than crystalline struvite. \nAt molar ratios Mg:Ca~1:1 and above, no more crystalline compound is formed but a substance \nidentified as an amorphous calcium phosphate.  \nAs Ca ions levels in sludge liquors are high in relation with Mg levels, Ca impact on struvite \ncrystal morphology will have to be considered in the future in order to improve the recovery \nand reuse as a fertiliser. \nFurther works will thus focus on the extrapolation of these laboratory results using a reactor \nwhich has been designed and is currently being used to study struvite nucleation and growth at \nlarger scale. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Doyle J.D.,Oldring K., Churchley J., Price C., Parsons S.A., Chemical control of struvite \nprecipitation.
