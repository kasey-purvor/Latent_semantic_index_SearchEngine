At first glance, the engineering problems of nuclear power plants and aviation \nmight seem remote from concerns about children\u2019s safety and well being but anyone from \nchild protective services would find their discussions and worries surprisingly familiar.  \nThey too are concerned with avoiding disasters that result in death or injury to humans.  \nThey too have experienced a series of well-publicised inquiries into their mistakes.   And \nthe resemblance to child protection work continues into the findings of those inquiries: \ndisasters are more often judged to be caused by people than being due to faulty \nequipment or organizational factors.  Human error was identified as the culprit in 70-75% \nof accidents in anasaethesia (Cooper, Newbower et al. 1984; Wright, Mackenzie et al. \n1991), and in over 70% of plane crashes (Organization 1993).  This is remarkably similar \nto my own finding from studying inquiries into child abuse deaths in the UK: 75% \nconcluded that professional errors made a significant contribution to the failure to see the \nrisk to the child and to take steps to protect him or her (Munro 1999). \n \nChild protection also resembles an engineering problem because efforts to improve \npractice have increasingly taken the form of providing tools for front line workers.  \nAssessment frameworks, procedure manuals, decision making instruments are all, like \npower drills and computers, designed to enhance workers\u2019 performance, by augmenting \nor replacing the skills and knowledge in their heads.  The proliferation of such tools has \ntransformed the work experience for practitioners (and for families) but, as many \ndisciplines have found to their cost, tools do not always have the intended effect.  How \nthey are used in practice and how they interact with other factors cannot be predicted in \nadvance but needs to be studied. \n The systems approach was developed in engineering because traditional solutions were \nnot working as well as expected.  Mistakes still kept being made, sometimes with \ndisastrous consequences.  Power plants got close to meltdown and planes crashed into \nmountains.  The standard solutions of providing more tools, more detailed manuals, and \ncloser management scrutiny were not eradicating human error.  Indeed, in some cases, it \nseemed that they were increasing the scope for error.  To deal with this puzzling outcome, \nengineers radically reframed the way they were looking at the problem.  Instead of \nregarding human error as a satisfactory explanation of an accident and therefore \nconcluding the investigation at that point, they treated it as the start of inquiry: why did \nthe front line worker misread the dial, omit crucial steps in the procedures, or overlook \nsigns of trouble?  This led them to investigate the total system within which the person \nwas operating so that they could better understand why the faulty action had looked the \nsensible thing to do at the time or why it might have been difficult for humans to perform \nwell.   \n \nThe systems approach led to new types of solution.   Basically, they take the form of \nredesigning the tasks expected of workers so that they are better tailored to the skills of \nhuman beings.  Mobile phones provide a simple example of faulty design.  People often \nhave trouble remembering their mobile phone number and make mistakes when asked to \nquote it; human errors are common.  But mobile phone numbers provide a good example \nof a predictable error because their design is poorly suited for use by human beings.  \nThey are typically a list of eleven random numbers and are presented in one block on \ncaller display.  However, the human short term memory can handle 7 items (plus or \nminus two) (Simon 1990).  It is therefore not surprising that people have difficulty in \ndealing with eleven digits.  People who master the art of remembering their own number \ngenerally do so by dividing it into three sub-groups (each less than 7 numbers long) and \nremembering each sub-group individually. \n \nThis article will illustrate how child protection services have followed the traditional \napproach of engineering in investigating errors and looking for ways to improve practice.  \nIt will also argue that, like engineering, the improvements are not working as well as \nhoped.  The case for switching to a systems approach will be made, offering a sketch of \nhow such an investigation would differ from the traditional and the new areas of \nquestioning to which it draws attention. \n \nMy experience is of the UK child protection system and so this provides most of the \nexamples I use, but it presents similar problems to the American system (indeed, it draws \nextensively on the US system for ideas so its similarity is not surprising). \nTraditional investigations \nThe history of child welfare is littered with tragic stories of children suffering prolonged \nabuse and then being killed by a parent.  The stories are all the more shocking because \nthese children were known to professionals whose duty it was to help and protect them.  \nIn some cases, as in the New Jersey foster care scandal, the children had been \u2018rescued\u2019 \nfrom their families only to be abused by their foster carers without their social workers \nrecognising the danger they were in (DePanfilis 2003).  The public, quite understandably, \ndemand an explanation of how the services failed these children and an assurance that \nsteps will be taken to prevent further cases.  The standard response is to hold an inquiry, \nlooking in detail at the case and trying to get a picture of the causal sequence of events \nthat ended in the child\u2019s death or serious injury.  Unlike the police investigation, which \nfocuses on the perpetrators of the homicide, these inquiries focus primarily on how the \nprofessionals acted, judging them against the formal procedures for working with families \nand principles of good practice. \n \nIn exploring why an incident happened, there is no objective point at which we can say \n\u2018this is the cause\u2019.  We are tracing a chain of events back in time to understand how it \nhappened.  Numerous factors are involved and, with any factor we see as causally \nimportant, it is possible to ask why it occurred and so continue tracing events further and \nfurther back in time.  In practice, some \u2018stop rules\u2019 are needed for deciding when an \nexplanation is sufficient and ending the investigation. \n \nRasmussen studied many different types of investigations and identified three main \nreasons for stopping (Rasmussen 1990).  Firstly, there are times when the search helps to \ndevise a solution that will prevent a recurrence, and so further inquiry is unnecessary.   \nSecondly, there are practical constraints that make it unfeasible to dig any deeper; time, \ncost and the cooperativeness of the people involved place limits on how detailed a study \ncan be made.   With inquiries into child abuse deaths, the terms of reference for the \ninquiry team put some boundaries on the type of search they are expected to make. \nThirdly, and most commonly, the questioning stops when a familiar, abnormal event is \nfound that provides a satisfactory explanation \n \nIn child protection inquiries, as in the inquiries held in medical and engineering disasters, \nthese familiar events that bring the investigation to a halt usually take the form of human \nerror.  Practitioners did not comply with procedures, or lapsed from accepted standards of \ngood practice.  There is a brief exception to this in child protection in that the inquiries in \nthe early 1970s tended to identify systemic as well as individual failings.  At this period, \nchild abuse had become more widely acknowledged and condemned.  The increased \npublic concern for victims of abuse then had to be translated into changes in professional \npriorities and organisation.  So, for instance, the Maria Colwell inquiry in the UK \n(Security 1974) identified faults in the whole system which, at that time, was not \ndesigned with child abuse as a prominent concern.  As a consequence of these early \ninquiries, formal procedures for investigations of allegations and professional \ncollaboration have been established in the UK and USA.  Later inquiries have \nincreasingly become focused on professional performance, with at least as much attention \nbeing given to whether procedures were followed as to assessing the quality of \nprofessional judgement and decision-making. \n \nWhy should professional error be so often seen as a sufficient explanation rather than just \nanother puzzling factor that needs understanding?   One reason is undoubtedly that it \nidentifies someone to blame.  When society is shocked and outraged by a child\u2019s terrible \ntale of suffering, there seems a basic human desire to find a culprit, someone to bear the \nguilt for the disaster and to be the target of feelings of rage and frustration.  Of course, \nwith these child deaths, it is a parent or carer who is primarily responsible for the \nhomicide but this does not seem to satisfy the urge to blame.  When Liam Johnson died in \nLondon in 1989, his Member of Parliament demanded a public inquiry, asserting that his \ndeath proved that \u2018something went very wrong\u2019 (London Borough of Islington, 1989).  \nPerhaps because public money funds a complex set of services to care for children and \nprotect them from precisely these sorts of tragedies, the public feel entitled to expect \nprofessionals to bear the responsibility for failure.  In Liam Johnson\u2019s case, however, the \npublic inquiry firmly concluded that the death was unpredictable and no professional \ndeserved blame. \n \nWhatever the dynamics at play, the public\u2019s emotional responses to child abuse deaths are \ncomplex and powerful, and seem to include a deep need to find a scapegoat.  The \ntraditional inquiry meets that need by focusing primarily on whether any professional was \nat fault.   \nTraditional solutions \nThe resemblance between child protection problems and other areas of work is clearly \napparent when we look at the solutions that are proposed to prevent errors.  Humans are \nseen as the prime source of unreliability and so solutions focus on ways of minimising \nand controlling their erratic behaviour.  The three main mechanisms have been \nintertwined in recent developments in child protection services:   \n \n\u2022 Punish the culprits and so encourage the others to be more diligent; \n\u2022 Reduce the role of individual human reasoning as much as possible, \nformalising where possible with increasingly precise instructions to the human \noperators; \n\u2022 Increase the monitoring of practice to ensure compliance with the instructions. \n \nIf we look at these in turn, blame is a major feature of professional life these days.  Front \nline workers are in no doubt of the fate awaiting them if they are caught up in a child \ndeath.  To some extent, doctors and social workers must accept responsibility for \nmalpractice but many of the mistakes identified in investigations are individually fairly \ntrivial and it is only because they coincided with other small errors that the disastrous \nsequence of events occurred.   In a recent UK inquiry, for instance, a social worker was \ncriticised for failing to get a new copy of a faxed medical report that was smudged and \ndifficult to read.  (Health 2003).   \n \nThe \u2018blame\u2019 culture is not peculiar to child protection but seems to be a part of society in \ngeneral (Hood and Jones 1996).  However, its manifestation in this context has \nsignificantly increased the risks of punishment to individual workers.  If the threat of \npunishment is an effective way to modify human behaviour, then it should be operating at \nthe maximum level within the child protection service.   \n \nThe second major mechanism for reducing human error is to limit the scope for fallible, \nindividual actions by replacing humans with tools as far as possible and giving them \ndetailed instruction manuals for the tasks they still have to do.  This has happened on a \nlarge scale in child protection. \n \nAt the time of Maria Colwell\u2019s death in 1973, social workers in the UK operated with a \nsurprising degree of privacy and autonomy.  There were few standard forms to complete \nexcept in relation to legal proceedings.  Recording was intended mainly to assist workers \nand supervisors in reviewing the casework process rather than to provide information for \nmanagers on how time was being spent. Social Services Departments were run as \nprofessional bureaucracies that, respecting professional expertise, allowed social workers \na high degree of discretion (Adams 1998).   Practice was therefore highly individualised \nand variable.  A detailed and large-scale study of practice in the 1970s concluded: \n \nA feature of all the studies was the wide-ranging freedom which social workers \nhad to choose the style and content of their direct work with clients (Parsloe and \nStevenson, 1978, p.134). \n \nThe degree of change in the past two decades is, therefore, substantial.  Practice has been \ntransformed by several innovations.  The autonomy of the individual has been steadily \neroded by the introduction of increasingly detailed protocols, procedural manuals and \nassessment frameworks.  Risk assessment and decision-making instruments are \nincreasingly being introduced to standardise practice and minimise the scope for \nindividual professional judgement.   \n \nThe third mechanism for reducing human error is to monitor practice more stringently \nand this is a clear feature of recent developments in child protection.  Again, the changes \nhere are not just peculiar to child protection but part of a much broader phenomenon.  \nWhat (Power 1997) terms \u2018the audit society\u2019 has transformed all branches of the public \nsector.  For a range of reasons \u2013 social, economic and political \u2013 there is now a demand \nfor greater transparency and accountability in all public services (Munro 2004).  Public \nconfidence and trust in professional expertise has weakened and the political shift to neo-\nliberalism has led to more concern to ensure taxpayers\u2019 money is being wisely spent.  \nSimilar developments in the USA led to the Government Performance and Results Act \n1993 that mandated that federal agencies establish standards for measuring their \nperformance and effectiveness.   \n \nProfessional autonomy has been further reduced by the \u2018new public management\u2019, which \nassumes that public bureaucracies are inherently inefficient and seeks to introduce market \nmechanisms to counter this.  Consequently, British social work departments now operate \nunder tight managerial surveillance, with performance targets set by government, and a \ncomplex set of information-processing tools to record what work is being done.  This \naudit system is not just a neutral mechanism monitoring that professionals are doing what \nthey say they will do.  It is increasingly dictating what professionals should do and how \nthey should do it.  The web page of the Audit Commission asserts that audit is designed \n\u2018to be a driving force in improving services\u2019 (www.Audit-Commission.gov.uk ).  These \ndevelopments mean that the responsibility for developing professional knowledge and \nskills is being merged with managerial and political goals of improving efficiency and \neffectiveness. \nHave the solutions worked? \nWhat has been the effect of such pervasive changes?  There has certainly been no \ndramatic improvement in children\u2019s safety or well-being.  A global judgement about \nwhether children\u2019s welfare has improved in the UK is difficult to make and many of the \nmost important influences on their well-being have been independent of children\u2019s \nservices.  Child poverty, for instance, has increased from 10% in 1979 (when a \nconservative government was elected) to 30% now (despite an explicit aim of eradicating \nchild poverty, the current Labour government has only taken about half a million children \nout of poverty, leaving 3-4 million behind).  Measures of child protection social work \nprovide a mixed picture and it is not always easy to know their significance.  Child deaths \nhave not reduced; reported child abuse has increased (but for all the familiar reasons may \nnot indicate an increase in incidence); the number of children taken into public care has \nincreased \u2013 but, again, it is hard to know whether to interpret this as a positive or negative \nfinding.  There are, however, some major causes for concern.   \n \nFirst, services in both the UK and USA have become increasingly concerned with \nproviding a crisis, reactive response to allegations of abuse, with a reduction in provision \nof preventive, supportive work with families (Health 1995; Waldfogel 1998).  Despite \nrepeated government exhortations to re-focus and put more emphasis on early \nintervention, social services departments in the UK are finding it hard to comply because \nthe public pressure to avoid any child deaths keeps serious child abuse at the top of the \nagenda.  Moreover, each investigation of an allegation of abuse now takes more time and \neffort as the procedures to follow have become more and more detailed.  Consequently, \nthe time and resources available for other areas of child welfare have been reduced. \n \nSecondly, staff morale has slumped leading to serious problems in recruiting and keeping \nexperienced personnel.  As recently as the early 1990s, child protection workers were \nseen as the elite branch of social work but, nowadays, some London boroughs have \nvacancy rates of 40% and those in post are often agency staff on short term contracts, \nmany recruited from overseas.  The London Borough of Brent, for example, one of the \nmost deprived parts of the city, has no social worker in their duty teams who has trained \nin the UK.  Social work as a career has also lost favour.  Applications to training courses \nplummeted by 59% between 1996 and 2001.  Despite an expensive government \nadvertising campaign in the past couple of years, applications have only risen by 8% from \ntheir low base. \n \nThirdly, a picture of current practice in the UK was provided by a recent public inquiry \ninto the death of Victoria Climbie (Department of Health, 2003).  While a single case \ncannot be assumed to be representative, it involved several different agencies in London \nand gives a vivid account of how professionals responded to information about this child.  \nLike the New Jersey foster care inquiry, it does not reveal a complex case requiring \nexceptional talent but an apparently straightforward case in which numerous \nprofessionals failed to follow basic principles of practice. \n \nVictoria spent her early years with her parents in the Ivory Coast but, when she was \nseven, they gave her to a great-aunt living in France, hoping this would increase her life \nopportunities.  Five months later, after coming to the attention of the French child welfare \nservices, the great-aunt moved to London, leaving her own children in France but \nbringing Victoria with her.  In less than a year, Victoria was dead, having suffered \nmonths of serious physical and emotional abuse, spending her last days, tied up in a black \nrubbish bag in a bath, malnourished and being frequently beaten.  Her sufferings were \nhorrific but what astounded the country was the realisation that her sufferings had not \nbeen hidden.  She had been known to four social services departments, two specialist \npolice child protection teams, two housing departments, and was twice admitted to \nhospital because of suspected abuse.  I have read every inquiry report since 1973 and this \none stands out for describing a level of practice \u2013 in all the professions and all the \nagencies \u2013 that is outstandingly worse than any other.  It was not that the mistakes were \nof a different kind but that they were so numerous; poor practice seems to have been the \nnorm rather than the exception. The report into her care concluded: \n \nVictoria died because those responsible for her care adopted poor practice \nstandards (Dept. of Health, 2003, para. 6.94). \n \nThis overview of developments in child protection suggests that are causes for concern \nabout the traditional approach to improving practice, making a fresh approach worth \nconsidering. \nSystems investigations \nThe cornerstone of the paradigm shift from a traditional to a systems investigation is to \ntake human error as a starting point for inquiry, not as a satisfactory explanation in itself.  \nWhy did so many professionals in Victoria\u2019s case adopt poor practice standards?  Lord \nLamming, who chaired the inquiry, concluded his report with the comment:  \n \nEven after listening to all the evidence, I remain amazed that nobody in any of the \nkey agencies had the presence of mind to follow what are relatively \nstraightforward procedures on how to respond to a child about whom there is a \nconcern of deliberate harm (Dept. of Health, 2003, para. 1.19). \n \nHis puzzlement, however, is stated as a conclusion instead of a question triggering further \ninvestigation.  His inquiry reiterates the traditional solutions of more blame, more \nprocedures, and more monitoring, without asking why previous, similar, solutions have \nnot been working.  Yet, finding an explanation of why people were operating at such a \nlow level seems essential if we are to find ways of making significant improvements. \n \nA systems approach treats human error as a starting point because it has a complex view \nof causality and the role the individual front line worker has in the sequence of events.  \nWhen the traditional investigation identifies professional error, it is assumed that the \nprofessional \u2018could have done differently\u2019 and so can be held responsible and merits \ncensure.  In the case of Victoria Climbie, for instance, the inquiry acknowledged that the \nkey social worker was working under adverse circumstances: she had never dealt with an \ninvestigation into an allegation of abuse before; she received only thirty minutes of \nsupervision over a period of 211 days, from a senior who was developing a major \npsychotic illness and gave her little sensible advice; and she had a caseload of nineteen \nfamilies, seven more than the maximum set down in the staff handbook.  Nonetheless, the \ninquiry held her responsible for her incompetence.  She was not only sacked from her job \nbut put on the official list of people considered unsuitable for working with children.   \n \nIn contrast, in a systems investigation, the operator is seen as only one factor; the final \noutcome is a product of the interaction of organisational culture, technical support, and \nhuman performance factors.  The ideal image of human rationality \u2013 captured in classical \ndecision theory\u2013 is of an individual rapt in thought, contemplating all the evidence before \nreaching a conclusion.  Research of rationality  \u2018in the wild\u2019 reveals a different picture \n(Hutchins 1995).  Judgement and decision making in child protection are best seen not as \ndiscrete acts performed by individuals in isolation but as part of a constant stream of \nactivity, often spread across groups, and located within an organizational culture that \nlimits their activities, sets up rewards and punishments, provides resources, and defines \ngoals that are sometimes inconsistent (Woods, Johannesen et al. 1994). Human errors are, \nin general, not random and individual but follow predictable patterns that can be \nunderstood by seeing them in their context. \n \nSystems investigations have highlighted how the traditional solutions to human error can, \nthemselves, be the source of further errors.  In 1979 there was a serious nuclear accident \nat the Three Mile Island power station.  The reactor core melted partially, and some \nradioactivity was released into the atmosphere.  The Kemeny Commission, the \npresidential board that investigated the disaster, concluded that faults with equipment \nplayed a small part but the major causes lay in the poor performance of the operators \n(Kemeny 1979).  Not only did they not take the correct steps to solve the problem, their \nactions made it worse.  As with children\u2019s deaths from abuse, their failure seemed all the \nmore surprising because such efforts had gone into improving their practice.  Engineers \nhad thought carefully about all possible accident scenarios and developed warning \nsystems to alert the operators to any fault or abnormal reading.  Indeed, they had been so \ndiligent that, at the time of the disaster, the control room had more than 600 alarm lights.   \nA later review of the event showed more compassion for the operators (Wildavsky 1988).  \nYes, they had misread the signals, but when such a major accident occurred, so many red \nlights started flashing that the human brain would have difficulty in accurately \ninterpreting their significance.  Efforts to improve safety had inadvertently introduced \nnew dangers.  Each alarm system, on its own, added to safety because it showed when \nsomething was going wrong and, if it started flashing on its own, operators would have \nno difficulty in understanding its significance and taking the appropriate action. But, in a \nserious accident, the effect of such a precautionary system was to be bewildering because \nso many alarms went off simultaneously. \n \nThe two reports \u2013 by Kemeny and Wildavsky \u2013 illustrate two opposing approaches to \nerror investigation.  Kemeny followed the traditional style, looking first of all for \nevidence of technical failing and then for failings in the human performance.  When \nhuman error was detected, this was seen as providing a satisfactory explanation.  \nWildavsky, on the other hand, adopting a system\u2019s approach, took the human error as a \nstarting point for investigation, not as a conclusion, and saw how changes to the system \nintended to improve it had had the unintended effect of making the task for the operator \nmore difficult. \nA framework for systemic inquiry \nAs the phrase suggests, a systemic inquiry looks at the whole context and so the potential \nareas to cover are numerous.  Within the limits of this article, I want to, first, outline a \nframework for analysis and, then, within that framework, focus on three issues that seem \nto me to be particularly significant in child protection at present. \n \n(Woods, Johannesen et al. 1994) provide the following diagram to illustrate the layers of \nanalysis that need to be undertaken. \n \nDiagram 1 around here. \n \nAt the \u2018sharp end\u2019 of the system are the practitioners interacting with children and \nfamilies.  Whether or not they are able to provide effective help will be a result of the \ninteraction between the difficulties and strengths of the family (what they bring to the \ncontact) and the expertise and resources the practitioners bring.  Influences on the actual \nlevel of professional performance achieved can be grouped into three layers: \n \n1. factors in the individual \n2. resources and constraints \n3. organizational context. \n \nFactors in the individual: this includes the knowledge and skills they can draw on in \nsolving problems, the attentional dynamics - factors that govern the control of attention \nand the management of caseload as situations evolve over time, and strategic factors \u2013 the \ntradeoffs between different goals that conflict.   \n \nAn investigation into how the front line workers were operating seeks to understand their \n\u2018local rationality\u2019 (Reason 1990) \u2013how the circumstances appeared to them and how their \nchoice of actions made sense to them at the time.  In Victoria Climbie\u2019s case, for \nexample, with the social worker who was criticised for picking up a smudged fax and \nfailing to contact the hospital for a clean copy, why did she act this way?  Her reasons did \nnot come out in the official inquiry but, since then, she has defended her decision by \npointing out that the fax consisted of nineteen badly smudged pages; she did decipher the \nfirst page - the covering letter \u2013 and this said, inaccurately, that the doctors had no child \nprotection concerns about the child.  Therefore, the time and energy required to read the \nfax or to request a hard copy did not seem justified given the other demands on her time.  \nHow much this explanation exonerates her is debateable but it illustrates that she was not \nacting from malice or indifference.  She clearly did not think that the fax might contain \ncrucial information that would dramatically alter her assessment of Victoria\u2019s safety but \nshe could not be bothered to find out what it said. \n \nThe critical recruitment problem in UK social work at present, and the dearth of \nexperienced workers, is likely to be having a major impact on the quality of front line \nwork.  \n \nThe factor I want to discuss in more depth in this category is that of emotional wisdom.  \nThe engineering literature tends to address the cognitive elements of performance with \nlittle attention to emotions.  I doubt whether they can be ignored in any work context but \nchild protection certainly makes psychological demands on the worker.  A child in \ndistress arouses a response in most people \u2013 hence the strength of the public reaction \nwhen a child dies.  But working with families carries many emotional pressures.  Workers \ncan get caught up in the dynamics of the family as well as bringing their own \nexperiences, sometimes constructively and sometimes not, to their work.  In the days \nwhen psychosocial casework was dominant, attention to the emotional impact of work \nwas a major component of supervision.  In the UK however, supervision has now become \nless available and when it does take place the major purpose is a managerial monitoring \nof whether the procedures have been properly followed rather than a professional review \nof the casework process and the judgements and decisions made (Rushton and Nathan \n1996).  This undervaluing of the emotional dimension may have significant adverse \neffects on both families and the workers themselves.  \n \nIn the report on Victoria Climbie, one feature that stands out is the apparent lack of \nconcern and compassion shown towards her.  No one engaged her in any substantial \nconversation during the eleven months she was in contact with various agencies.  No-one \nappears to have reflected on what her life was like: whether or not she was being \nphysically abused, it was known that she had been taken from her birth family in the \nIvory Coast and was living in a country whose language she did not speak, in a hostel for \nthe homeless where many of her co-residents were drug addicts or had mental illnesses.  \nShe was not attending school.  She clearly needed help irrespective of the issue of abuse.   \n \nThe failure to empathise undoubtedly contributed to the defective assessment of her needs \nbut it also raises disturbing questions about the staff who came into contact with her.  \nPeople who choose to join a helping profession do not begin as callous and uncaring so, if \nthis is how they treated Victoria, what had happened to them?  One possibility is that \nthere is a high degree of burnout in frontline workers nowadays (this would also partly \nexplain the high number leaving the job).  Burnout has three dimensions: emotional \nexhaustion, depersonalisation (or cynicism), and reduced personal accomplishment \n(Maslach, Schaufeli et al. 2001).  The main symptom is exhaustion and it leads people to \ndistance themselves emotionally and cognitively from their work, with predictable \nconsequences for the children and parents who come into contact with them.   \n \nThe public inquiry into Victoria\u2019s care made no comment on the psychological health of \nthe workers it criticised except to report that the senior social worker responsible for \nsupervising the key social worker had become psychotically ill by the time of the inquiry \nand was probably becoming ill at the time Victoria was being seen. \n \nOverall, the rise of a managerial approach to social work tends to have downplayed \nfeelings and framed the tasks as essentially cognitive.  This seems to me to be a serous \nerror since any system designed on such an inaccurate assumption about the workforce is \ngoing to have a fundamental flaw.  It is well established that emotions influence cognitive \nperformance (Baron 1994) and we should also be concerned for the emotional well being \nof both families and staff. \n \nResources and constraints:  this second category includes the obvious issues about what \nservices are available to help practitioners assess or work with families.  How easy is it to \narrange an expert psychological assessment or offer help with coming off drugs?  For UK \nsocial workers, the reality of recent years has been that there are fewer and fewer support \nservices available so that for most families caught up in the child protection system they \nexperience a distressing investigation of an allegation of abuse followed by no help, even \nthough most of them, whether or not abusive, are in adverse social and financial \ncircumstances and struggling to cope  (Farmer and Owen, 1995).   \n \nWithin this category, the issue I want to focus on is the impact of the tools that front line \nworkers are now expected to use.   Procedural manuals, information-processing tools, and \ninstruments to help risk assessment and decision-making are now widespread and have \ntransformed the nature of child welfare work. They have all been introduced with the \ngood intention of improving front line performance but are they doing so?  Do they \nimprove reasoning skills and outcomes for children or are they, in fact, a hindrance to \nworkers?   \n Again, the engineering literature provides some valuable lessons.   Design has usually \nbeen tool-centred rather than user-centred (Norman 1993).  In deciding what tools to \ndesign or what parts to formalise, engineers have tended to select those that it is \ntechnically easy to do. This has permeated the approach to developing tools and to \nautomating or formalising aspects of any process.  It seems to be assumed that tools or \nformalisation are intrinsically good and so the more the better.  Little attention is paid to \nwhether these are the aspects that humans do badly and where technical assistance is most \nneeded.  Nor is much attention given to how use of the tools impacts on the bits of the \ntask that are left over for humans to handle. \n \nThis approach led to serious problems in, for example, aviation (LaPorte and Consolini \n1991; Pool 1997).  The pilot\u2019s job was radically altered through automation.  Previously \nthey had been flying a plane with some assistance from equipment but with a constant \nawareness of what was going on and what each dial was reading.  Automation led to a \ncockpit in which the plane was essentially flown by a computer; the human pilot only had \nto step in if something went wrong.  Unfortunately, this meant that, when they did have to \nstep in, they were thrust straight into the middle of the problem with limited knowledge \nof what had preceded it.  They were, therefore, poorly equipped to diagnose the problem \nand deal with it.  When they misinterpreted the evidence and the plane crashed, the \ndisaster was blamed on human error but blame should also go to those who designed a \ncockpit that created such challenging cognitive tasks for the pilots.  Fortunately for \npassengers, this systemic analysis has led to modifications being made to the cockpit \ninstrumentation to increase pilots\u2019 awareness of what is going on at all times so that they \nare better prepared in the event of a crisis. \n \nAre developments in child welfare vulnerable to similar criticisms?  Have academics \ntended to offer the assessment instruments or decision-making tools that they know how \nto design?  Or have they been user-centred and started by looking at the task, the human \ncognitive and emotional abilities of practitioners, and considered what help is needed, and \nat what stage in the process?  \n \nGiven the extent of innovation in terms of tools, there seems a surprising dearth of \nresearch about how they are actually used and whether they are contributing to a better \nservice.  The studies that have been done provide evidence that the various tools are not \nbeing used as the designers intended.  English and Pecora described workers completing a \ndecision making instrument after they had made their decision, to justify and document it \nrather than to guide them in making the decision (English and Pecora 1994).  Lyle and \nGraham found workers deliberately inflating their rating of risk items on a risk \nassessment instrument to ensure that families were classified as at high enough risk to be \ngiven the services the worker wanted them to have (Lyle and Graham 2000).  Research \non risk assessment instruments in other disciplines has found worker scepticism about \ntheir accuracy, preferring to trust their own clinical judgement instead (Harris, Rice et al. \n1993; Krysik and LeCroy 2002). \n \nThere is an emerging literature in child protection questioning whether tools are being \ndesigned and implemented with a realistic picture of the practice world in which they will \nbe used (Schwalbe 2004).  There has also been a tendency to give little attention to the \nworker\u2019s contribution to the effective use of a tool.  A risk assessment instrument, for \ninstance, can list what information is needed but it is the level of the worker\u2019s skill and \nknowledge that determines how accurate and complete the information collected is, and \nthis, in turn, will determine the accuracy of the instrument\u2019s prediction.  Rycus and \nHughes complain: \n \nMuch risk assessment training has been likened to teaching airline pilots how to \ncomplete a pre-flight checklist before taking off, without ever having taught them \nnavigation, meteorology, or even the essentials of flying the plane.  Yet, many \njurisdictions continue to expect two or three days of training on a risk assessment \nmodel to fully prepare staff to implement it consistently and accurately (Rycus \nand Hughes 2003). \n \nA systems approach not only highlights the importance of finding out how tools are \nactually being used but also makes us aware of rival ways of interpreting those findings.  \nThe traditional approach, echoing the approach of inquiries into child deaths, tends to \nclassify any usage that differs from what was intended by the designer as \u2018human error\u2019; \nthe fault is only seen to be on one side.  This then leads to the usual solutions, described \nearlier, of chastising workers, increasing training with more detailed manuals, and \nincreasing managerial oversight of compliance with instructions.   \n Alternative interpretations of the findings can be found by taking the workers\u2019 point of \nview seriously.  What is their \u2018local rationality\u2019 that makes it seem sensible to them to \nmodify or ignore tools that should be making their work easier?  It may be that they have \nan irrational resistance to formal methods of reasoning but there are more respectable \npossibilities.  Two factors that I want to speculate about here are (a) conflicting views on \nthe nature of human reasoning, and (b) the dual character of many tools. \n \nIn trying to theorize about human reasoning, there have classically been two models: the \nanalytic and the intuitive.  Analytic reasoning is formal, explicit, and logical.  Ideally, \nevery step of the reasoning process is spelt out, as in a proof in formal logic.  Intuitive \nreasoning, in contrast, is seen as inarticulate, swiftly reaching a conclusion on the basis of \nlargely unconscious processes.  The designers of tools tend to take analytic reasoning as \ntheir model and develop instruments based on probability theory and formal decision \ntheory.  Front line workers have historically, shown a preference for intuitive reasoning.  \nFrom this starting point, it is hardly surprising that there should be a clash between the \ntwo groups.  The question is how to resolve the conflict.   \n \nOne avenue to a resolution is offered by Hammond\u2019s \u201cCognitive Continuum Theory\u201d \n(Hammond 1996).  He argues that, rather than being two opposing modes of thought, it is \nmore realistic to see analysis and intuition as on a continuum, with people choosing a \nmore analytic or intuitive approach depending on the circumstances.  When, for example, \nspeed or background knowledge of culture and psychology are crucial (as in interviewing \na family) intuitive reasoning is more functional.  When there is time, a need for public \naccountability, or the consequences of the cognitive task are serious (as in deciding on \nremoving a child) then a more deliberative approach is preferred.  I have argued in more \ndetail elsewhere about how this continuum approach can be developed in child protection \nwork (Munro 2002).  However, in this context, the point to make is that it opens up the \npossibility that front line workers\u2019 resistance to using tools as the designer intended may \nhave some rational justification and it is worth studying it in more detail.     \n \nThe second factor I wish to draw attention to is the dual character of many tools now \nroutinely used in child protection: improving workers\u2019 performance and supplying \ninformation for management.  As I mentioned earlier, there have been radical changes in \nthe way child protection services are managed and the new public management requires \ndetailed information about what work is being done. \n \nManagers have to rely on front line staff to supply much of the data and so many of the \nforms workers are expected to complete are designed to meet the needs of management as \nmuch as the users.  The repercussions of these fundamental changes needs to be studied \nin more detail (Munro 2004) but the UK provides one stark illustration of how significant \nthey have been.  Recent research on workers\u2019 activities found that, due to the increased \nadministrative demands, the amount of time spent in direct contact with families has \ndropped from 30% to 11%.  The increase in paperwork is also a significant factor in the \ncurrent recruitment problems.  In the Audit Commission\u2019s large scale study of why \nworkers were leaving, it was identified as the main factor driving people away \n(Commission 2002).   \n \nTo sum up, I am not arguing against the use of tools.  Indeed, in view of the limitations of \nhuman cognition and the biases in reasoning that intuition is prone to, there is a strong \ncase for arguing that some type of tools could help practitioners.  However, there also \nseems a strong case for arguing that current efforts are not well designed and need to \nbecome better tailored to the real practice context in which they will be used. \n \nOrganizational context: this third category influences the amount of knowledge and \nskills brought to bear on the front line work through investments in training and provision \nof support.  It has a particularly important influence on the strategic dilemmas \npractitioners face in that it conveys overt and covert messages about what is valued or \ndisparaged.  These can increase the complexity of the tradeoffs they have to make, \nespecially when they are conflicting, and place workers in a \u2018double bind\u2019 where they are \nliable to be criticised whatever they do. \n \nIn child protection work, there is a persistent and unavoidable dilemma between \nsupporting families and protecting children, balancing the rights and needs of children \nand parents.  The history of the past few decades shows fluctuations in society\u2019s view of \nwhere the balance lies.  When family support has priority, the threshold for removing \nchildren rises and more children will be left in a dangerous setting.  A death then triggers \na swing towards prioritising protecting children.  The threshold for removal falls, more \nchildren come into care and then there is a backlash when the general public fear that \nprofessionals are getting too powerful and invading the privacy of the family too readily \n(Myers 1994; Munro 1999).  \n \nThis classic dilemma is easier for the individual practitioner to handle when he or she is \nworking within an organization that acknowledges the problem and gives a clear and \nconsistent message about where the balance currently lies.  However, in the UK, senior \nmanagement seem to have a problem with this at present because they, in turn, are getting \nan inconsistent message from central government.  Official policy clearly states that more \nattention must be given to supporting families and less time spent on expensive \ninvestigations of allegations, most of which do not reveal serious abuse.  There is no \nacknowledgement, however, that reducing the number of detailed investigations done will \nlead, in some cases, to decisions about the seriousness of abuse being based on less \ninformation and hence being more fallible.  There is no official acceptance of the \nincreased risk of child deaths.  Indeed, the response to the recent death of Victoria \nClimbie reinforced the message that the first and overriding concern must be the safety of \nchildren.  Perhaps official policy can, somewhat cynically, be summed up as \u2018you must \nwork in partnership with parents and support them in all cases except those that hindsight \nreveals to have been dangerous\u2019.  Unfortunately, front line workers have to make \ndecisions without the benefit of hindsight. \n \nCurrent government policy is creating another, new, conflict for practitioners.  The \nwelfare of the child must be the prime concern.  At the same time, they have introduced a \ncomplex system of targets and performance indicators, and an accompanying pile of \npaperwork, and told social services that they will be evaluated and judged in the light of \nthis system.  This creates dilemmas about which matters most \u2013 the child or the \nperformance indicator.  On a daily basis, this shows up in decisions about how to spend \nyour time, talking to a child, reflecting thoroughly on a case in supervision, or completing \nforms.  Since future budgets depend on current scores on performance indicators, senior \nmanagement are understandably concerned that paperwork gets done. \n \nThe Audit Commission provides a neat example of how the battle between therapeutic \nand managerial goals is played out.  In evidence to the Climbie inquiry, the chairman of \nthe Audit Commission complained that social workers were sticking too rigidly to the \ntimetable for completing an investigation so that case conferences were being held before \nall the relevant information had been gathered, damaging the quality of the assessment \nand decision making.  In the same year, the Audit Commission published the league \ntables on how local authorities were performing which rated how successfully they had \nmet the timetable for investigations \u2013 with no concession that failure to hold a conference \nin the specified time could indicate good practice as well as bad. \n \nThe greater intrusion of government into the lives of senior management and of both \ngovernment and senior management into the lives of front line workers is proving very \nproblematic, creating conflicting demands and double bind situations.  With the best of \nintentions, central government is having a pervasive and, I would argue, detrimental \nimpact on the experience of the children and parents who come into contact with social \nworkers.   \nConclusion \nChildren\u2019s safety and well-being are of vital importance in any society so there is heavy \npublic pressure to improve child protection services.  The professions involved have put \nconsiderable effort, thought, and resources into raising standards.  However, social \nworkers learned from the controlled trials evaluating practice in the 1960s and 70s that \ngood intentions do not guarantee good outcomes for service users and that lesson is just \nas relevant today.  It is crucial to evaluate the numerous changes that have been \nintroduced in recent years.  Are the tools designed to help practitioners achieve a higher \nstandard of work actually having the desired effects or are they absorbing time and \nmoney with little benefit?  Could they even be having a positively detrimental effect on \nworkers\u2019 performance?      \n \nA systems focus radically changes the traditional perspective.   Instead of the front line \nworkers dominating the picture, the limits of their autonomy are recognised and they are \nplaced in their wider context.  Investigations to understand why they lapse from the \ndesired standards of practice consider the full range of factors operating on them: do they \nhave the necessary knowledge and skills, are the right resources available to support \nthem, does the organisation set feasible and consistent goals?   \n \nThe fallible human operator is not then seen as the central problem with solutions trying \nto find various ways of eliminating or reducing their role.  Instead, the investigation starts \nby looking at what is needed to do the job well and then considering what aspects humans \nare good at and where they need help.  The inquiry then works outwards to find out \nwhether the organisation is providing the context in which high quality work can be done.   \nSolutions tend to take the form of redesigning the task so that it makes feasible demands \non practitioners, taking a realistic view of human cognitive and emotional skills.   \n \nEvaluating the changes that have occurred in child protection practice is particularly \nnecessary because they reflect both professional and political needs that, while having a \nsurface similarity, have significantly different priorities.  All public sector services have \nbeen exposed to demands for greater transparency and accountability by social pressures \nand the needs of the new style of public management.  This has led to new ways of \ndescribing and recording what work is being done, and placed heavy demands on front \nline workers to complete the information processing tools that provide the basic data for \nmanagement.  The professional goal of improving practice has also encouraged a more \ntransparent and testable way of working, encouraging practitioners to articulate their \nreasoning more clearly and to use empirical evidence where available to inform their \ndecisions.  However, the aspects of practice that get recorded for management purposes \ncannot be assumed to coincide with the aspects needed for professional development.  In \nthe UK, the audit system that has been developed places more emphasis on recording the \neasily measured elements of work and so has given more attention to measures of \nquantity than of quality.  This inadvertently undervalues the more nebulous, but often \nmore difficult, aspects such as relationship skills in working with angry or frightened \npeople, or making sense of human behaviour by placing it in its social and psychological \ncontext.   \n \nThe individual case with a tragic outcome attracts public attention and, quite reasonably, \nthere is a demand to look into what happened.  The public want to know if anyone other \nthan the perpetrator is to blame and whether lessons can be learnt to prevent similar cases \nhappening again.   However, a focus on the individual case where a child dies has limited \nscope for teaching us what is working well or badly.  The systems approach offers new \nways of framing the problems and holds out the promise of more effective solutions. \n References \nAdams, R. (1998). Quality Social Work.
