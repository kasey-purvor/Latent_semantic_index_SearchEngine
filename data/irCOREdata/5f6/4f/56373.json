Th e Coccinellidae comprises over 4200 species worldwide (Iperti 1999, Ma-\njerus et al. (2006a)). Audisio and Canepari 2009 report that there are approximately \n253 species and subspecies of Coccinellid in Europe. However, a review in 1999 \ndocumented only 110 species including species acclimatized through the 1900s: Ro-\ndolia  cardinalis, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, Rhyzobius (Lindorus)  lophanthae, Rhyzo-\nbius  forestieri and Serangium parcestosum (Iperti 1999). Th e discrepancy in species \nnumber from these diff erent sources can not solely be accounted for by the addition \nof new species arriving in Europe but is an indication of the dynamic state of coc-\ncinellid taxonomy and the diffi  culty of establishing a checklist for Europe. Not only \nis the taxonomy of coccinellids under review but also the arrival of new species is \nongoing; recently the UK Ladybird Survey (www.ladybird-survey.org) reported the \nfi rst British record of Cynegetis impunctata (Th omas et al. 2009). Th ere is also con-\nsiderable variation in reported coccinellid diversity between countries. Great Britain \nis relatively species poor with only 46 species (Majerus et al. 2006b) whereas in \ncontrast the Netherlands have 86 native coccinellid species. Th e proportion of alien \nspecies for this group is quite high in Europe, with 13 species observed in the wild \nto date. Two of these are native to Europe but alien within Great Britain ( Henosepil-\nachna argus, Scymnus  impexus) and Sweden (Scymnus  impexus). For the remainder of \nthis section only the 11 species alien to Europe (and not the three alien species in \nEurope) will be considered.\nTh e majority of coccinellid species (about 90 %) are benefi cial predators (others \nare phytophagous or mycophagous); consequently coccinellids have played a signifi -\ncant role in the development of biological control strategies (Berthiaume et al. 2007, \nBrown and Miller 1998, Galecka 1991, Gurney and Hussey 1970, Iperti 1999, Obry-\ncki and Kring 1998). Th is has been a major factor in the movement of coccinellids \nbetween countries worldwide.\n8.4.2 Taxonomy of the coccinellid species alien to Europe\nTh e family Coccinellidae belongs to the coleopteran superfamily Cucujoidea and is \na member of the phylogenetic branch of Coleoptera termed the Cerylonid complex \nof families (Cerylonidae, Discolomidae, Alexiidae, Corylophidae, Endomychidae and \nLathridiidae). Worldwide there are six subfamilies of Coccinellidae: Sticholotidinae, \nChilocorinae, Scymninae, Coccidulinae, Coccinellinae and Epilachninae although a \nrecent phylogeny suggests a seventh subfamily, Ortaliinae (F\u00fcrsch 1990, Kov\u00e1\u0159 1996). \nEuropean species are mainly represented by three subfamilies: Scyminae, Chilocorinae \nand Coccinellinae. Th ere are very few European Sticholotinae, very few Coccidulinae \nand only three species of Epilachninae (Iperti 1999). Although the species list for Coc-\ncinellidae in Fauna Europaea (Audisio and Canepari 2009) includes representatives \nfrom all six subfamilies.\nSpecies alien to Europe are quite evenly represented between fi ve of the six sub-\nfamilies. Th ree species are observed in the subfamily Coccidulinae (two Coccidulini \nLadybeetles (Coccinellidae). Chapter 8.4 295\nand one Noviini) and in the Scymninae (two Scymnini and one Hyperaspidini). Two \nspecies are in the Chilocorinae (two Chilocorini) and Coccinellinae (two Coccinel-\nlini). One species is in the Sticholotidinae (Sticholotidini). Th ere are no Epilachninae \nthat are alien to Europe (although  Henosepilachna argus is alien in Europe).\nMost species in the Epilachninae are phytophagous, while the majority of spe-\ncies in the other subfamilies are predatory. Th e preferred diets of the two feeding \nstages in the life-cycle, the larval and adult stages, are generally the same. Most \npredatory ladybirds feed on either aphids or coccids (a few feed on both), however \nsome predatory species feed on mites, adelgids, aleyrodids, ants, chrysomelid larvae, \ncicadellids, pentatomids, phylloxera, mycophagous coccinellids and psyllids (Dixon \n2000). Indeed, a small number of species within the Coccinellinae and Epilachninae \nare mycophagous, feeding on the hyphae and spores of  fungi. Th ere is also consider-\nable variability in the degree of dietary specialisation between species (Hodek 1996). \nSome species have a very narrow preferred prey range, such as a single species of \nmite, aphids of a single genus, or plants of a single family, other species have a wide \nprey range. Harmonia  axyridis, for example, will feed on aphids, coccids, adelgids, \npsyllids, and the eggs and larvae of many other insects, including other coccinellids \nand lepidopterans (Legaspi et al. 2008, Ware and Majerus 2008). Ladybirds exhibit \ncomplex adaptations to specifi c or more general diets such as mandibular dentition, \ngut length and structure, and morphological features that aff ect mobility (Hodek \n1996). Many predatory coccinellids will feed on alternative foods, such as pollen, \nnectar, honey-dew and  fungi (many also resort to cannibalism) when preferred prey \nare scarce (De Clercq et al. 2005, Hodek 1996).\nCoccinellids are distinguished from the remainder of the Cerylonid complex of \nfamilies by a number of adult characteristics: fi ve pairs of abdominal spiracles, tento-\nrial bridge is absent, anterior tentorial branches are separated, frontoclypeal suture \nabsent, apical segment of maxillary palpus never aciculate, galea and lacinia separated, \nmandible with reduced mola, front coxal cavities open posteriorly, middle coxal cavi-\nties open outwardly, metaepimeron parallel-sided, femoral lines present on abdominal \nsternite 2, tarsal formula 4-4-4 or 3-3-3, tarsal segment 2 usually strongly dilated be-\nlow (Kov\u00e1\u0159 1996). In Europe, the diagnostic features of the family Coccinellidae can \nbe considered in more simple terms (Majerus 2004). Th ey are small to medium sized \nbeetles (1.3\u201310 mm in length). Th ere body shape is oval, oblong oval or hemispherical \n(upper surface convex and lower surface fl at). Th ey have large, compound eyes. Th e \nantennae are often 11-segmented but this fi gure varies and can be as low as seven. Th e \nmouthparts consist of large, strong mandibles; four-segmented maxillary palps (termi-\nnal segment axe shaped) behind the mandibles; labium divided into the pre-labium \nand post-labium; three-segmented labial palps; and the labrum. Th e head can be partly \nwithdrawn under the pronotum. Th e pronotum is broader than long and has anterior \nextensions at the margin. Th e legs are short and can be retracted into depressions under \nthe body. Th e tarsi are usually four segmented but the third segment is small and hid-\nden in the end of the second segment. Each tarsus bears two claws. Th e abdomen has \nten segments (Kov\u00e1\u0159 1996, Majerus et al. 2006a).\nHelen Roy & Alain Migeon \/  BioRisk 4(1): 293\u2013313 (2010)296\n8.4.3 Temporal trends of introduction in Europe of alien coccinellids\nTh e fi rst species of coccinellid to be introduced into Europe was the vedalia beetle, R. \n cardinalis, for the control of the cottony cushion scale (coccid), Icerya purchasi (Figure \n8.4.1). Two further species were introduced during the early twentieth century (mainly \nto the Mediterranean regions including France, Portugal and Italy) but there then fol-\nlowed a period of stagnation and respect to biological control in general. Th is correlates \nwith the trend towards chemical insect pest control with the development of synthetic \npesticides. From the 1980\u2019s onwards there were a considerable number of introduc-\ntions on an extensive scale across Europe through the use of tropical coccinellids to \ncontrol glasshouse pest insects.\n8.4.4 Biogeography of the coccinellid species alien to Europe\nEach continent has a specifi c fauna of coccinellidae. Belicek (1976) stated that \u201cmany \nspecies develop their cycles in life zones delineated by the general physiography of the \ncontinents (mountainous barriers) and climatic patterns combined with the types of \nvegetation in a given zone\u201d. Glaciation had profound eff ects on the distribution of coc-\ncinellids and the level of endemism is further controlled by ecological factors including \ntemperature, food and natural enemies.\nTh e temperate zones of Europe and North America are heavily infested by Aphi-\ndae and grasslands in these regions contain coccinellids from the tribus Coccinellini \n(Coccinella spp., Adalia spp., Harmonia spp.) and Hippodamiini, Cheilomenini and \nScymnini. Open deciduous and coniferous forests in this temperate zone contain other \ngenera of Coccinellini (Anatis spp., Myrrha spp., Myzia spp.). Tropical zones in central \nand South Africa, South America, India and China where Coccidae are abundant are \ncharacterised by coccinellids from the tribus Chilocorini (Chilocorus spp., Exochomus \nspp., Brumus spp.), Scymnini, Hyperaspini, Coccidulini and Noviini. In the Mediter-\nranean regions of Europe, aphids and coccids are found together and are attacked by \ncoccinellids from the temperate and tropical zones (Iperti 1999).\nIt is interesting to note that coccinellids native to temperate zones enter either sim-\nple quiescence or intense diapause as adults. In contrast, exotic species such as Rhyzo-\nbius  lophanthae and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri do not enter quiescence or diapause but \ninstead resist drastic changes in climate by reducing the speed of development during \nwinter but not entirely stopping it (Iperti 1999).\nTh e early introductions of alien coccinellids were characteristically as classical bio-\nlogical control agents; the predatory coccinellid originated from the same country as \nthe target pest insect. So, for example, both R.  cardinalis and I. purchasi originated from \nAustralia; R. lophanate and various Diaspididae (Pseudolacaspis pentagona, Quadraspidi-\notus perniciosus, Chrysomphalus dictyospermi, Parlatoria  blanchardi) from Australia and \nNew Zealand; C. montrouzieri and  Planococcus citri from Australia. Notably all these \nspecies are from tropical regions and were introduced into Mediterranean regions for \nLadybeetles (Coccinellidae). Chapter 8.4 297\ncontrol purposes (Figures 8.4.1 and 8.4.2). In contrast, the coccinellid species selected \nto reinforce the activity of native natural enemies in temperate regions of Europe are \nfrom temperate regions of the globe for example, temperate Asia (H.  axyridis) or North \nAmerica (Hippodamia  convergens).\n8.4.5 Distribution of alien Coccinellids in Europe\nTh e distribution of alien coccinellids in Europe mirrors the biogeographical distribu-\ntion and patterns of introduction (Figure 8.4.3). Some species have dispersed widely; \nH.  axyridis has spread rapidly from countries where it was deliberately introduced to \nmany others across Europe. Furthermore, the commercial production of coccinellids \nby biological control companies and local producers led to a rapid increase in distribu-\ntion thoughout the 1990\u2019s.\n8.4.6 Use of alien coccinellids for biological control in Europe\nTh e ecosystem service that predatory coccinellids provide in consuming pest insects \nhas been recognised for over a century. Th e vedalia ladybird, R.  cardinalis, is consid-\nered to have initiated modern biological pest control. It was released as a classical bio-\nFigure 8.4.1. Temporal trends in the mean number of new records per year of coccinellid species alien to \nEurope from 1875 to 2008. Th e number above the bar indicates the total number of alien species newly \nrecorded during the considered time period.\nHelen Roy & Alain Migeon \/  BioRisk 4(1): 293\u2013313 (2010)298\nlogical control agent (native to Australia) in 1887 to control an alien cottony cushion \nscale (coccid), I. purchasi, which was threatening the citrus industry of California. Th e \nvedalia ladybird and the cottony cushion scale are still present in Californian citrus \ngroves but the ecological balance between predator and prey ensures that the pest is no \nlonger a problem (Caltagirone 1989, Majerus et al. 2006a).\nTh e successful introduction of R.  cardinalis for the control of I. purchasi result-\ned in considerable focus on Coccinellidae for importation programmes worldwide \n(Obrycki and Kring 1998). Over 40 species of coccinellid were introduced to North \nAmerica following R.  cardinalis during a period colloquially referred to as the \u201cla-\ndybird fantasy\u201d (Caltagirone 1989, Dixon 2000). Th is worldwide phenomenon was \nmainly ineff ectual; only four of over 40 species introduced to North America during \nthis time established (Caltagirone 1989). In recent times there have been 155 at-\ntempts to control aphids and 613 to control coccids worldwide through the introduc-\ntion of ladybirds (Dixon 2000). On a scale of success (complete, substantial, partial \nor no control) only one attempt to control aphids using coccinellids has been ranked \nas substantially successful and none have been completely successful (Dixon 2000). \nIn contrast, 23 complete and 30 substantial successes have been achieved against \ncoccids (Dixon 2000). In a few cases the introduced coccinellid species has had far-\nreaching, unacceptable impacts on biodiversity and so has been deemed an invasive \nspecies. Harmonia  axyridis, harlequin ladybird, is the only such example in Europe \n(Brown et al. 2008a).\nAll of the 11 alien coccinellids in Europe have been intentionally released as bio-\nlogical control agents of pest insects. Th e fi rst coccinellid to be introduced to Europe \nwas R.  cardinalis as a predator of I. purchasi in 1888 (Portugal), 1901 (Italy) and 1912 \n(Italy and France). Th is species was subsequently released through the mid and late \n1900s to Italy, Portugal, Israel, France, Spain, Malta, Great Britain, Albania, Cyprus, \nSwitzerland and the Ukraine. Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, native to Australia, was in-\ntentionally released to control mealybugs (Pseudococcidae),  Planococcus citri, from \n1908 in Italy. Subsequent releases were made in Spain (1926), Corsica (1970), France \nFigure 8.4.2. Origin of the 11 alien coccinellid species established in Europe.\nLadybeetles (Coccinellidae). Chapter 8.4 299\n(1974), Portugal (1984) and Sweden (2001). Th is species is considered established \nin all the countries where it has been released other than Sweden (for which the sta-\ntus of this species is unknown). Cryptolaemus montrouzieri has been used extensively \nthrough augmentation (release of reared adults) and was the fi rst coccinellid used to \ndemonstrate an inoculative approach (whereby the aim is introduce a small number of \nindividuals into a crop system with the expectation that they will reproduce and their \noff spring will continue to provide control of the target pest for an extended period of \ntime). Cryptolaemus montrouzieri is easy and cheap to culture on mealybugs (Majerus \n2004). Rhyzobius  lophanthae is a species native to New Zealand which was introduced \nto Italy in 1908 for the control of Diaspididae (armoured scale insects). It has been \nreleased widely in European countries including: Portugal (1930 and 1984), Spain \n(1958), Sardinia (1973), France (1975), Greece (1977) and Germany (2000). Th is \nspecies has recently been reported as established in London, Great Britain (Natural \nHistory Museum, 2008).\nFigure 8.4.3. Colonisation of European countries and islands by coccinellids alien to Europe where \nknown. Scale = total number of recorded alien coccinellids.\nHelen Roy & Alain Migeon \/  BioRisk 4(1): 293\u2013313 (2010)300\n8.4.6.1 Control of Scale Insects\nA number of coccinellid species have been used in historically signifi cant and success-\nful projects for the biological control of scale (Borges et al. 2006, Erler 2001, Katsoy-\nannos 1997) including R.  cardinalis and R.  lophanthae. Other species introduced to \nEurope for control of scales include Rhyzobius  forestieri, Nephus reunioni, Chilocorus \nnigritus and  Chilocorus kuwanae.\nRhyzobius  forestieri (native to Australia) has established in Italy, France, Greece and \nAlbania. In the Cambos coastal plain of Greece this species is now considered the most \nabundant species of coccinellid within the coccidophagous guild (Katsoyannos 1997). \nNephus reunioni (native to Africa) was intentionally released in a number of countries \n(Italy, Portugal, France, Greece, Albania and Spain) and is now considered to be estab-\nlished in Italy and Portugal. Chilocorus nigritus is native to the Indian sub-continent \nand South East Asia and is a candidate biological control agent for the control of spe-\ncies within the Coccoidea including three economically important families (Diaspidi-\ndae, Pseudococcidae and Coccidae). It has a recent history, 1985 onwards, of introduc-\ntion to a number of countries: Italy, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Great \nBritain and Albania.  Chilocorus kuwanae is a biological control agent of scale insects \nand was introduced to Europe (Albania and Italy) from Asia in 1989.\n8.4.6.2 Control of Aleyrodidae\nTh e family Aleyrodidae comprises the commonly referred to whitefl ies. Over fi fty \nspecies of coccinellidae attack eggs and immature stages of whitefl y pests (Obrycki \nand Kring 1998, Yigit et al. 2003). Th ere is interesting variation in the preda-\nFigure 8.4.4.  Harlequin ladybeetle (Harmonia  axyridis). Credit: Mark Bond\nLadybeetles (Coccinellidae). Chapter 8.4 301\ntory behaviour of these polyphagous coccinellids; some are mobile, seeking out \nprey, and others are sedentary, and complete preimaginal development on one leaf \n(Obrycki and Kring 1998). In Europe one species, Serangium parcesetosum, has been \nintroduced for the control of whitefl y ( Bemisia tabaci). Serangium parcesetosum was \nintroduced from its native range of Asia and the Indian subcontinent to France \nincluding Corsica (Majka and McCorquodale 2006). A further species Delphastus \ncatalinae, native to North America, has been introduced in glasshouses within Al-\nbania and Russia for the control of  Bemisia tabaci and Trialeurodes  vaporariorum \n(Kutu k and Yigit 2007, Legaspi et al. 2008). However, this species has not estab-\nlished in the wild. Studies on the thermal biology of D. catalinae, assessing the ef-\nfects of temperature on development, voltinism and survival in the laboratory and \nfi eld (non-indigenous range), indicate a strong correlation between survival in the \nlaboratory at 5 \u00baC and in the fi eld in winter (Simmons and Legaspi 2004, Simmons \nand Legaspi 2007). Delphastus catalinae died out quickly in winter temperatures \nand this suggests that the probability of establishment is low in regions that experi-\nence low temperatures and scarcity of suitable food for part of the year (van Len-\nterenet et al. 2003). In the absence of studies on cold tolerance it is insuffi  cient to \nassume that, on the basis of climate matching, winter would be an eff ective barrier \nto establishment of species originating from warmer climatic zones (van Lenteren et \nal. 2006). Risk assessments should also be suffi  ciently detailed to encompass strain \nspecifi c parameters; the release of a non-diapausing strain versus a diapausing strain \ncould result in very diff erent impacts (van Lenteren et al. 2006). Furthermore, im-\npacts through consumption of non-target hosts and dispersal require considerable \nattention (van Lenterenet et al. 2003). So, for example, although D. catalinae is not \nanticipated to survive winter temperatures in northern Europe, it is oligophagous \nFigure 8.4.5. Adults of Cynegetis impunctata.

Hippodamia  convergens is native to America and \nseveral billion are collected annually from overwintering sites in California and sold \nthroughout America. Th is practice has been shown to be highly ineff ective because of \nadult dispersal (Dixon 2000, Roy and Majerus, unpubl.). Furthermore, removal of H. \n convergens is considered to have adverse eff ects on local populations and, in America, \nis responsible for the distribution of two ladybird parasites (the braconid wasp, Dino-\ncampus coccinellae and the microsporidian, Nosema hippodamiae) (Saito and Bjornson \n2006) and vectoring of plant pathogens (dogwood anthracnose fungus) (Bjornson \n2008). Th is coccinellid has been released in Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Albania and \nthe Czech Republic in the 1990s and early 2000. It is unknown whether or not it is \nestablished.\nTh e use of H.  axyridis as an augmentative biological control agent (mass reared \nand released) has been widespread (Berkvens et al. 2008, Brown et al. 2008a). In 1982 \nit was introduced into France and has since been reared continuously over 100 gen-\nerations on industrially produced eggs of the moth, Ephestia  kuehniella (Brown et al. \n2008a). It has since been introduced to a number of countries across Europe and also \nspread to others which had not intentionally released it (Table 8.4.3).\nFigure 8.4.6. Adult of the phytophagous bryony ladybeetle,  Henosepilachna argus. Credit: Mike Maje-\nrus. \nLadybeetles (Coccinellidae). Chapter 8.4 303\n8.4.7 Ecosystems and habitats invaded in Europe by alien Coccinellids\nCoccinellid species can be classifi ed as stenotopic or eurytopic (Hodek 1993, Iperti \n1991). Microclimate is considered to be a particularly important feature of a coc-\ncinellid habitat. Many species of ladybird exhibit a preference for specifi c vegetation \ntypes or certain strata of the habitat. Coupled with this is the requirement for suitable \nfood in suffi  cient abundance. Habitat preference varies seasonally as the microclimatic \ncharacteristics of a habitat change, which in turn infl uences the distribution of prey \npopulations and the behaviour of coccinellids. Iperti (1999) documents the succession \nof aphid outbreaks in south eastern France; during a normal year aphids fi rst appear on \nlow plants and shrubs, they then progress to cultivated low plants and early deciduous \ntrees and develop on cultivated trees and shrubs. However, climatic conditions vary \nannually and so it is diffi  cult to predict the behaviour of coccinellids, particularly in a \nperiod of climate change.\nTh ere is a strong trend for alien coccinellids to occur in urban or cultivated habitats \nin Europe. Almost all species are most prevalent in recently cultivated agricultural, hor-\nticultural and domestic habitats, gardens and parks and greenhouses (EUNIS catego-\nries I I1, I2, J100; see appendix II). Harmonia  axyridis, the most invasive of the alien \ncoccinellids in Europe, follows this pattern although there have been a considerable \nnumber of records in Great Britain from natural habitats (Brown et al. 2008b). Indeed, \nH.  axyridis is documented from both woodlands and forest habitats, small anthropo-\ngenic woodlands, parks and gardens, agricultural and horticultural habitats as well as \nfrom buildings in cities, towns and villages.\nTh e abundance of native and alien coccinellid species in urban habitats and their \ntendency to aggregate in large numbers during autumn and winter enhances their \nFigure 8.4.7.

Th is aggregation behaviour can be exploited by biological control \npractitioners through the collection and release of large numbers of beetles but species \nthat exhibit this behaviour, such as H.  axyridis, are increasingly seen as nuisance insects \nin domestic dwellings (Roy and Majerus 2006, Roy et al. 2008).\n8.4.8 Ecological and economic impacts of alien coccinellids\nTh e ecological and economic impacts of alien coccinellids are not well documented. \nMany authors have noted the low success rate of coccinellids as biological control \nagents of aphids (Dixon 2000, Iperti 1999, Majerus et al. 2006a). Th e success of coc-\ncinellids as biological control agents of coccids is higher than that of aphids but still \nrelatively low at only 40 % of cases studied being designated as exerting complete or \nsubstantial control (Iperti 1999).\nRodolia  cardinalis has been heralded as a success story for biological control (Calta-\ngirone 1989). Th is species has been introduced into 33 countries to control I. purchasi \nand has yielded complete control in 26 countries (North America, Argentina, Peru, \nChile, Portugal, Uruguay, Venezuela, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Morocco, Tunisia, \nTurkey, Egypt, India, Japan and New Zealand); substantial control in four countries \n(Russia, Libya, the Bahamas, Ecuador) and partial control in two countries (Seychelles \nand Mauritius). A similar rate of success was achieved through the acclimatization of \nC. montrouzieri to control Pseudococcus spp. (Iperti 1999). Th erefore, R.  cardinalis and \nC. montrouzieri have contributed economic benefi ts through the ecosystem service \nthey provide. Indeed, the initial cost of the R.  cardinalis introduction programme in \nCalifornia 1888 was $1 500 with a return in just over a year of millions of dollars \n(Majerus 2004).\nTh e lack of success of aphidophagous coccinellids has been attributed to asyn-\nchrony between the reproductive and development rates of the predatory coccinellids \nand their aphid prey (Dixon 2000). Furthermore, many aphidophagous coccinellids, \nin temperate climates, are univoltine whereas aphids are multivoltine. Coccidophagous \ncoccinellids tend to stay in a localised area throughout their life cycle and, in contrast, \naphidophagous coccinellids disperse widely (Iperti 1999).\nMost intentional insect introductions do not cause ecological or economic prob-\nlems, indeed of all the intentionally introduced insects to North America only 1.4\u00a0% \nhave caused problems (van Lenteren et al. 2003). Indeed insect introductions are \nconsidered to be relatively safe: less than 1 % cause a population level eff ect in non-\ntargets and only 3\u20135 % may have caused smaller scale eff ects (van Lenterenet et al. \n2003). However, a number of coccinellids are documented as having non-target ef-\nfects (van Lenterenet et al. 2003). Cryptolaemus montrouzieri is reported to lower the \neff ectiveness of an introduced natural enemy (Dactylopius opuntiae) for weed control \n(Goeden and Louda 1976). Th e most infamous coccinellid introduction is undoubt-\nedly H.  axyridis (Majerus et al. 2006b, Roy and Majerus 2006, Roy et al. 2005, Roy \nand Wajnberg 2008).\nLadybeetles (Coccinellidae). Chapter 8.4 305\nHarmonia  axyridis has been released as a classical biological control agent in North \nAmerica since 1916. It has been commercially available in Europe since the 1980s and has \nmany attributes that contribute to its economic viability, including its polyphagous nature. \nHarmonia  axyridis preys on a wide variety of tree-dwelling homopteran insects, such as \naphids, psyllids, coccids, adelgids and other insects (Koch et al. 2006). In North America, \nas well as off ering eff ective control of target pests, such as aphids in pecans (Tedders and \nSchaefer 1994), H.  axyridis is also providing control of pests in other systems such as Aphis \n spiraecola in apple orchards (Brown and Miller 1998) and several citrus pests (Michaud \n2002). In both Asia and North America, H.  axyridis has been reported to contribute to \ncontrol of aphids on sweet corn, alfalfa, cotton, tobacco, winter wheat and soybean (Longo \net al. 1994). Th e spread and increase of H.  axyridis throughout Europe could, therefore, \nprove to be benefi cial to ecosystem services through the reduction in aphid numbers below \neconomically damaging levels and subsequent reduction in the use of chemical pesticides.\nTh e polyphagous nature of H.  axyridis means that negative impacts on non-target \nprey species would appear to be inevitable (Majerus 2006, Pell et al. 2008). However, \nthere is very limited empirical evidence on this subject and studies considering the \neff ects of H.  axyridis on the population demography of non-target aphids, coccids \nand other prey species away from crop systems have not been conducted. Harmonia \n axyridis has been implicated as a potential predator of immature monarch butterfl ies, \nDanaus plexippus, an aposematic species that contains defensive chemicals (Koch et al. \n2003). Laboratory studies have also indicated the potential for H.  axyridis to engage \nin intra-guild predation (Pell et al. 2008, Roy et al. 2008, Ware and Majerus 2008). \nIt is likely that many other species will be directly or indirectly aff ected by the arrival \nof H.  axyridis. Indeed, intraguild predation is thought to be an important force in \nstructuring aphidophagous ladybird guilds (Yasuda et al. 2004) and so H.  axyridis has \nthe potential to dramatically disrupt native guilds in Europe. Harmonia  axyridis is a \nlarge, aggressive, polyphagous coccinellid (with a tendency for intraguild predation) \nthat could impact on the abundance of native coccinellids and reduce their available \nniches (Legaspi et al. 2008).\nTh e wide dietary range of H.  axyridis coupled with its ability to disperse rapidly, \nforage widely and continuously breed gives this species the potential to signifi cantly \nreduce European populations of coccids and aphids. Th is is, of course, considered ben-\nefi cial in crop and horticultural systems, but not in other habitats where such direct \ncompetition for prey may result in a reduction in biodiversity and declines in native \nbenefi cial predators and parasitoids of aphids and coccids (Majerus 2006).\nMajerus et al. (2008) noted that the negative eff ects of H.  axyridis on other aphido-\nphages are likely to be the result of a complex range of interactions, with H.  axyridis in \ngeneral having a competitive edge through resource competition, intraguild predation \nand a more plastic phenotype. A more rapid development rate, continual breeding \nability and lack of diapause requirement, effi  cient chemical defence and relatively large \nsize would provide H.  axyridis with a signifi cant reproductive advantage over many \nnative British species. Th e pattern is anticipated to be widespread throughout Europe \n(Brown et al. 2008a).\nHelen Roy & Alain Migeon \/  BioRisk 4(1): 293\u2013313 (2010)306\n8.4.10 Conclusions\nCoccinellids have been introduced widely throughout Europe for the biological con-\ntrol of pest insects. Some of these species have established and for others the status is \nunknown. It is diffi  cult to estimate the proportion of alien coccinellids in Europe for \ntwo reasons: there is not a defi nitive European check list for coccinellids and the status \nof some of the alien species is unknown. However, the proportion of alien coccinellids \nappears to be higher (approximately 5\u201310 %) than the proportion of aliens for other \ntaxonomic groups (3.1 % alien Diptera). Only one species (H.  axyridis) is considered \nto be invasive.\nAcknowledgements\nHER is based in the Biological Records Centre (within the NERC Centre for Ecology \n& Hydrology) and receives co-funding from the Joint Nature Conservation Com-\nmittee and the Natural Environment Research Council.
