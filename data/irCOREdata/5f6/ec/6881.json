Enterprise in Higher Education (EHE) has funded five pilot RBL projects\nduring the past year, including one in introductory economics. The project was managed by\nthree lecturers in the School of Social Sciences, supported by an Academic Development\nOfficer. Learning outcomes were completely revised, and a range of assessment strategies,\nincluding computer-based tests, was identified. A resources guide was produced which\nidentified the materials and activities that would enable students to achieve the learning\noutcomes. A number of innovations were adopted, including:\n\u2022 computer-based curriculum delivery, assessment, and student evaluation of the course;\n\u2022 an open approach to assessment;\n\u2022 abolishing lectures in favour of a diverse range of teaching and learning activities.\nA mid-semester computer-based evaluation was conducted using Question Mark Designer,\nwith the specific intention of providing data to inform future curriculum revision.\n93\nMalcolm Ryan et d Resource-based learning strategies: implications for students and institutions\nRationale for the adopted approach\nPrevious work had shown that where computer-based methods were simply 'bolted-on' to\nexisting teaching, neither students nor lecturers used them effectively, if at all (Freeman and\nWells, 1994). The team felt that to be successful, FT needed to be an integral part of the\nprogramme (including its assessment), and that continuing curriculum review was essential.\nAccordingly, we began by identifying the relevant knowledge, skills and concepts needed by\nstudents at an introductory level, and turned them into clearly stated learning outcomes. This\nwork entailed staff development on the part of the three subject specialists, and hence support\nfrom the Academic Development Officer. To facilitate testing of the learning outcomes, a\nrange of assessment strategies was identified, in which the benefits of providing students with\ninformative and frequent feedback were recognized (see Rowntree, 1992a, 24-7,162).\nIt was noted by the team that individual difference affects the way students learn (Tomlinson,\n1985; Messick, 1978, vi, 300, 310); adoption of a range of teaching and learning strategies was\ntherefore paramount. The nature of the subject and diversity of available resources made\nmanagement of teaching and learning situations an important issue. Consequently, it was\ndecided that a guide matching resources to outcomes and assessment would be an invaluable\naid to students and staff.\nThe unit was introductory and university-wide for students taking degrees other than\neconomics or business studies but needing a basic understanding of economics. We could not\nassume previous exposure to the subject, and general background varied widely. The previous\nproject had shown that we should insure against unexpected technical problems by timetabling\nsupervised computer workshops.\nA simple numerical problem then arose. We had 90 students and the maximum group we could\nplace in the computer laboratory was 30. Moreover, our timetable called for three consecutive\nteaching hours. We therefore had to divide the class into three groups of 30 and process them\none at a time; the remaining innovations were driven by this and the fact that just three subject-\nspecialist teachers were available.\nWe could have dropped traditional seminars; but we decided not to, so that we could discuss\nwith the students their laboratory work and associated learning outcomes. Thus, we tacitly\nrecognized that computer-based learning on its own could not, at least so far, achieve the\noutcomes of the unit.\nThe same constraints suggested the most radical (in a local context) innovation which we\nmade: to abandon lectures and substitute a timetabled hour of self-directed study. We knew\nfrom the previous work mentioned above that laboratory sessions for 30 students were likely to\nbe unmanageable unless two teachers were on hand, and in each hour one member of staff was\nalways needed to conduct the seminar. Hence scrapping lectures was not something we set out\nto do for educational reasons; we simply ran out of hours and staff.\nMid-semester evaluation\nAs Question Mark Designer was used as part of the programme of assessment of the students,\nits use for student evaluation of the course seemed both appropriate and convenient.\nAccordingly, the software was used to administer a mid-semester questionnaire on student\n94\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nresponse to the course. Reaction to the computer-based activities was very positive, with 79%\nof respondents stating that they found them very useful as a learning aid. When asked to\nindicate which of the strategies they would most like retained in the unit programme, 70%\ncited the supervised computer workshops. Reaction to the computer-based assessments (which\ncontributed to students' final grades) were also positive, and there was evidence to suggest that\nstudents used them as a learning device (see below).\nOpen assessment was welcomed by students, with 90% favouring publishing examination\nquestions in advance. The discussion, planning, structured feedback and sharing of essay plans,\nwhich also contributed to the final grade, was regarded as very useful by 84% of respondents.\nHowever, asked what changes to the unit students would like, 94% wanted formal lectures\nadded to the existing range of activities.\nComment\nThe very positive response to computer-based activities is significant, and justifies the team's\nview that embedding IT into the curriculum as a means of acquiring skills and concepts is\nsound. However, it was noted that some students spent considerable amounts of self-directed\nstudy time on the computer activities, yet many were unable - or perhaps unwilling - to\ncomplete some of the tasks which were needed as part of the seminar programme. This\nsuggests that students found that the additional tutor-contact gained from attending workshops\nsupported by specialist staff was motivating, but despite extra tuition some failed to identify\nthe role of the computer-based activities in preparing for seminars.\nWe had previously discovered that it was difficult to disentangle acquisition of the IT skills\nneeded for a particular activity from understanding the economic concepts. Also, experience\nwith computer-aided learning packages suggested that students are reluctant to use the\nsoftware outside scheduled classes, partly because they find it technically and logistically\ndifficult to do so. This, plus our strong belief that such activities need to be supervised by a\nsubject-specialist with computer experience (Freeman et al, 1995), were the reasons for\ntreating workshops as part of teaching time and staffing them with economists.\nStaff scepticism about multiple-choice questions was partly dispelled by the way students used\nthe computer-based tests as an aid to learning. It would have been possible to score 100% in\nthe first of these tests merely by recording the feedback given by the program and entering this\nat the second attempt. But students did not 'cheat' in this way; instead, they repeated the test\nuntil they achieved what they regarded as a satisfactory score. These repeated attempts, the\nresultant improvements in scores, and the summative nature of the test, suggest that the\nstudents were motivated both to learn and succeed (see Rowntree, 1992a, 22-4). Thus the use\nof computers in assessment brought about a fundamental change in the relationship between\nthe students and the test - essentially, by placing the students in control of when and how often\nthey took it (see Laurillard, 1988,218).\nAs well as the qualitative data generated by the students' evaluations, we have a substantial\nbody of quantitative data resulting from the number, variety and frequency of assessments.\nPreliminary results (Wells et al, 1995) suggest that open assessment, even when students can\nexplicitly practise for it, has no less power to discriminate between different levels of\nachievement than traditional methods (in the examination there were 16 upper seconds, 23\n_\nMalcolm Ryan et o\\ Resource-based learning strategies: implications for students and institutions\nlower seconds, 23 thirds, 13 fails, and no firsts). In fact, comparison of results from the course\nessays and the students' attempts on the same topics in the examination actually shows a small\ndecline in average performance (Table 1), thus undermining the idea that open assessments are\nless rigorous. Moreover, there is evidence of improvement on the part of students whose essay\nresults were weak: of the 22 students who scored less than the median essay mark of 59,15 did\nbetter on the same question in the examination, while of the 27 who scored 59 or more, only\nfive improved on their essay mark (and 15 of the 27 declined by more than 10 marks).\nTable I: Comparison of results from course essays and\nexamination\nAt the first session of the unit, students were told it was resource-based and given documents\nincluding an introduction to the unit, a timetable of the weekly sessions, the intended learning\noutcomes, the final examination questions, and advice on how to organize their work. This\namount of information was unusual for a taught unit, but was felt to be necessary if students\nwere to be supported and guided through this new experience (see Rowntree, 1988, 11, 163).\nHowever, evaluation suggests that this provision was ineffective.\nThe students' desire for traditional lectures appears to be grounded in the view articulated by\none student: 'What I did not like about the course is that I was expected to find out everything\nmyself instead of being told'. An important issue here is that students wanted lectures in\naddition to the other resources provided, a preference for a greater emphasis on tutor-led\nactivity clearly implying that they wanted more direction and less autonomy and control (see\nRowntree, 1992b, 62). They felt that lectures would be useful for defining terms and providing\nan overview, reviewing relevant book chapters and identifying examination topics. Classroom\nexperience and informal discussion with students suggest that some felt threatened by an\napproach which demanded not only that they become responsible for their own learning,\nincluding planning and managing their time effectively, but also that they use one set of\nlearning opportunities (the computer workshops) to provide material for another (the\nseminars). Some students admitted to liking the approach, but found it strange compared to\ntheir previous experience of the institution, where the formal lecture followed by a discussion\nseminar was the norm. The novelty of this unit's approach might have been both an advantage\n- in terms of motivating students - but a disadvantage insofar as it posed a potential threat to\ntheir psychological safety.\nThis desire for more tutor contact rather than less has serious implications in a higher-\neducation culture currently seeking to reduce contact time. The double-edged sword of novelty\nmight also pose problems in an institution wanting to promote RBL. If the approach is to gain\nwider acceptance, then both these issues need further investigation.\nSome conclusions and observations\nIf the adoption of RBL is viewed as an opportunity to review the curriculum, then it may also\nbe used as a vehicle for embedding IT into that curriculum. Our experience shows that in order\n_\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nto be effective, any such activity must be appropriately supported and supervised, and the\noutcomes need to contribute to the final grade. ';\nIt is clear that while students may welcome some innovations, they also wish to retain\ntraditional approaches, and that they value contact with tutors. If students perceive lectures as\nimportant and necessary, then an approach which precludes them may not be popular. An\ninstitution wishing to move towards RBL will thus need to consider these perceptions and how\nbest to accommodate them.\nCompared with more traditional approaches, and in common with open and distance learning,\nstudents and staff need a different, and wider, range of skills., If students are required to use\nnew learning technologies, they need to be competent users of software, hardware and\ninformation, and to be able to manage their time effectively. Institution-wide use of such\ntechnologies can occur only if all undergraduates possess or have the opportunity to acquire\nthis vast array of skills. One possible approach is a core programme in information and study\nskills and computer literacy for all undergraduates. An alternative - which we favour - is to\nembed these skills into the curriculum of all subject areas so that they become contextualized,\nas they did within this project.\nFurthermore, our experience teaches us that staff engaged in this approach need to be able to\nredesign and evaluate curricula, understand new learning technologies and employ them\nappropriately, construct a range of learning and assessment activities to meet outcomes, design\nteaching and learning materials, provide tutorial support, and operate effectively in teams.\nWhile one may argue that these are the skills all teachers in higher education require, in our\nexperience RBL makes the full range of these skills essential and not merely desirable.\nThis raises the issue of staff development (see Rowntree, 1992b, 260-63) Even where these\nskills already exist, the time required to prepare the project described above exceeded that for a\nstandard lecture and seminar programme. Innovation is an expensive exercise (which in our\ncase was funded by the EHE). Unless sufficient funding can be found it is unlikely that\nthorough and continuing curriculum review can be sustained within the current cost-cutting\nregime.\nFurther infrastructural implications include the physical design of IT facilities so as to permit\ndiscussion and other group activities in conjunction with computer work, the technical support\nneeded to ensure that hardware is configured correctly and software operates as intended, and\nthe training of IT support staff to play a pedagogical rather than merely technical role.\nThe significance and role of student feedback, while currently a popular issue and target for\nautomation, also needs to be examined further in the light of what it revealed about our\nstudents and their views on our approach.\nFinally, further investigation is needed into how an institution sets about 'mainstreaming'\ninnovation so that it becomes the rule rather than the exception. There are, in our view, many\nobstacles to this, not least of which are prevailing organizational cultures. Cultural shift is a\nlong-term goal of enormous scale, but to adopt RBL in an otherwise alien culture is likely to be\nunproductive, if not foolhardy.\n97\nMalcolm Ryan et al Resource-based learning strategies: implications for students and institutions\nReferences\nFreeman, A. and Wells, J.
