Bridges1 and F. Dias2\n1Department of Mathematics, University of Surrey,\nGuildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, England\n2CMLA, ENS Cachan, CNRS, PRES UniverSud, 61,\navenue du President Wilson, 94230 Cachan cedex, France\nAbstract\nIt is shown that there is an overlooked mechanism whereby some kinds of dissipation\ncan enhance the Benjamin-Feir instability of water waves. This observation is new, and\nalthough it is counterintuitive, it is due to the fact that the Benjamin-Feir instability\ninvolves the collision of modes with opposite energy sign (relative to the carrier wave),\nand it is the negative energy perturbations which are enhanced.\n1\nThe discovery of the Benjamin-Feir (BF) instability of travelling waves was a\nmilestone in the history of water waves. Before 1960 the idea that a Stokes wave\ncould be unstable does not appear to be given much thought. The possibility that\nthe Stokes wave could be unstable was pointed out in the early 1960s [1\u20134], but it was\nthe seminal work of Benjamin and Feir [5, 6] which combined experimental evidence\nwith a weakly nonlinear theory that convinced the scienti\ufb01c community.\nIndeed, Benjamin & Feir started their experiments in 1963 assuming that the\nStokes wave was stable. After several frustrating years watching their waves disin-\ntegrate \u2013 in spite of equipment and laboratory changes and improvements \u2013 they\n\ufb01nally came to the conclusion that they were witnessing a new kind of instability.\nThe appearance of \u201csidebands\u201d in the experiments suggested the form that the per-\nturbations should take. A history of these experiments and the outcome is reported\nin [7].\nThe theory of the BF instability is based on inviscid \ufb02uid mechanics, and the\nassumption that the system is conservative. Therefore it is natural to study the\nimplication of perturbations on the system. The implications of a range of pertur-\nbations on the BF instability have been studied in the literature: for example the\ne\ufb00ect of wind [8, 9] and the e\ufb00ect of viscosity [8, 10\u201313]. Some perturbations have\nbeen shown to stabilize and others destabilize the BF instability.\nHowever, there is a fundamental overlooked mechanism in all this work. Mathe-\nmatically, the BF instability can be characterized as a collision of two pairs of purely\nimaginary eigenvalues of opposite energy sign as shown in Figure 1. In [14], this\nobservation is implicit but the demonstration and implications have not been given\nheretofore. This characterization of the BF instability also appears in the nonlin-\near Schro\u00a8dinger (NLS) model for modulation of dispersive travelling waves [15, 16].\nThe eigenvalue with smaller positive imaginary part in the \ufb01gure \u2013 just before col-\nlision \u2013 has negative energy, whereas the eigenvalue with larger imaginary part has\npositive energy. This energy is relative to the energy of the carrier wave EStokes:\nE\u2212 < EStokes < E+ where E\u00b1 are the energies of the modes associated with the\n2\nAmp\n\u03c3\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the eigenvalue movement associated with the BF instability, as a\nfunction of the amplitude of the basic carrier wave (Amp) and the sideband wavenumber\n\u03c3. For a \ufb01xed \u03c3 (vertical dashed line), there is a threshold amplitude. Below the threshold,\nthe eigenvalues are purely imaginary. At the threshold a collision occurs and above the\nthreshold, the eigenvalues are complex.\nrespective purely imaginary eigenvalues in Figure 1. Hence \u201cnegative energy\u201d means\nthat E\u2212 \u2212 EStokes < 0.\nOnce these facts are established we can appeal to the result that dissipation\ncan destabilize negative energy modes [18\u201320]. There are many examples in \ufb02uid\nmechanics where negative energy modes \u2013 which are stable in the inviscid limit\n\u2013 are destabilized by the addition of dissipation [21]: Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\n[18, 19, 22], interaction of a \ufb02uid with a \ufb02exible boundary [23, 24], stability of a \ufb02uid-\nloaded elastic plate [25], Euler modes perturbed by the Navier-Stokes equations [26].\nThe book of Fabrikant & Stepanyants [22] reports on experimental results for\ninterfacial waves near the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability illustrating the enhancement\nof the instability of negative energy waves due to dissipation. See Figure 3.5 on page\n83, and the discussion on pp. 82-83 in [22].\nIn this brief communication, we sketch the basic result for water waves and then\nuse a nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger model perturbed by dissipation for illustration. The\nNLS equation has shortcomings (e.g. symmetry which enables the phase to be fac-\ntored out, lack of validity for all time [27]) but it provides a simple example of the\n3\nphenomenon.\nDavey [10] gives a general argument for the form of a dissipation-perturbed NLS\nmodel, and Blennerhassett [8] starts with the full Navier-Stokes equations for a free-\nsurface \ufb02ow with viscous free-surface boundary conditions and derives a similar per-\nturbed NLS equation. For the dissipatively perturbed Stokes wave in deep water,\nthese NLS models take the form\niAt + (\u03b1\u2212 ia)Axx + ibA + (\u03b3 + ic)|A|2A = 0 , (1)\nwhere A is the envelope of the wave carrier, and the modulations are restricted to one\nspace dimension x. When a = b = c = 0, equation (1) reduces to the NLS equation\nfor the modulations of Stokes waves in deep water; hence \u03b1 and \u03b3 are positive real\nnumbers. This NLS model has a BF instability and one can show explicitly that it\ninvolves a collision of eigenvalues of the form shown in Figure 1. We show below\nthat when a > 0, there is always dissipation induced instability (before the BF\ninstability), no matter how small a is. The parameter a is the perturbation of the\nrate of change of the group velocity dcg\/dk due to dissipation.\nFirst, consider the linear stability problem for gravity waves in deep water. As\nthe wave amplitude increases we show that there is a threshold value at which two\neigenvalues of the linear stability problem collide, and these two modes have negative\nand positive energy.\nWith \u03b8 = x \u2212 ct, the speed c and amplitude \u03b7 of the basic gravity wave of\nwavelength 2\u03c0\/k, to leading order, are c = c0(1 + k\n2\u03b52 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), c20 = gk\u22121,\n\u03b7(\u03b8) = \u03b5\u03b71(\u03b8) + \u03b5\n2\u03b72(\u03b8) +O(\u03b53) ,\nwhere \u03b5 is a measure of the amplitude,\n\u03b71(\u03b8) =\n\u221a\n2 cos(k\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80) , \u03b72(\u03b8) = k cos(2k\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b80) ,\nwith \u03b80 an arbitrary phase shift. Using standard results on integral properties of\nStokes waves, the total energy relative to the moving frame is\nEStokes = T + V \u2212 cI = V \u2212 T , using 2T = cI ,\n4\nwhere T and V are the kinetic and potential energies respectively, and I is the\nmomentum [28]. Substitution of the Stokes expansion shows that EStokes = 0 +\n\u03b53E3 + O(\u03b54). Although the actual value of E3 is not important for the argument\nbelow, it is noteworthy that it is negative, and, using Table 2 of [28], one can con\ufb01rm\nthat EStokes is negative at \ufb01nite amplitude as well.\nTo formulate the linear stability for gravity waves take\n\u03b7(\u03b8, x, t) \u0003\u2192 \u03b7\u0302(\u03b8, \u03b5) + \u03b7(\u03b8, x, t) ,\nwhere \u03b7\u0302(\u03b8, \u03b5) is the basic carrier wave. Take a similar expression for the velocity\npotential \u03c6(\u03b8, x, y, t), where y denotes the vertical space dimension. Next one sub-\nstitutes this form into the water wave equations, linearizes about the carrier wave\nand takes \u03b7(\u03b8, x, t) of the form\n\u03b7(\u03b8, x, t) = Re\n(\n\u03a3(\u03b8, \u03c3)ei\u03c3x+\u03bbt\n)\n,\nwhere \u03c3 is real (the modulation wavenumber), and \u03a3(\u03b8, \u03c3) is periodic of the same\nperiod as the Stokes wave. The result is an eigenvalue problem for the eigenfunction\n\u03a3 and eigenvalue \u03bb.\nThe BF instability corresponds to a solution of this eigenvalue problem with\n0 < \u03c3 \u0005 1 and Re(\u03bb) > 0. When \u03c3 is \ufb01xed \u2013 but nonzero and small \u2013 and the\namplitude of the Stokes wave is increased, there is a threshhold amplitude where the\nBF instability occurs, and it corresponds to a collision of two eigenvalues as shown in\nFigure 1. To leading order the eigenvalues collide at \u03bb = \u00b1icg\u03c3, where cg = 12\n\u221a\ng\/k\nis the group velocity.\nTo show that the colliding modes have opposite energy sign, we need a de\ufb01nition of\nthe energy of the perturbation. This de\ufb01nition requires some consideration because\nthe perturbation is quasiperiodic in space: 2\u03c0\/k\u2212periodic in \u03b8 and 2\u03c0\/\u03c3\u2212periodic\nin x. The total energy relative to the moving frame is\nEtotal =\n\u03c3\n2\u03c0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\/\u03c3\n0\nk\n2\u03c0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\/k\n0\nE\u0302 d\u03b8 dx ,\n5\nwhere E\u0302 = T\u0302 \u2212 V\u0302 \u2212 cI\u0302, V\u0302 = 1\n2\ng\u03b72,\nT\u0302 =\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n2\n(\u03c62\u03b8 + 2\u03c6\u03b8\u03c6x + \u03c6\n2\nx + \u03c6\n2\ny)dy , and I\u0302 =\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u2212\u221e\n(\u03c6\u03b8 + \u03c6x)dy .\nEvaluating the perturbation energy for the two modes that collide leads to Etotal =\nEStokes + \u03b52E\u00b12 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , with\nE\u00b12 = 2(k \u00b1 \u03c3)\n(\n1\u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2213 \u03c3\nk\n)\n|C\u00b1|2 .\nHere C\u00b1 are scale factors associated with the eigenfunctions. Clearly sign(E+2 E\n\u2212\n2 ) <\n0 for 0 < \u03c3 \u0005 1.\nHaving shown that the colliding modes have opposite energy sign, we consider a\nsimple example which illustrates the mechanism for destabilization of negative energy\nmodes by damping. A prototype for a conservative system, where the linearization\nhas a collision of eigenvalues of opposite energy sign, which is perturbed by Rayleigh\ndamping is\nqtt + 2bJqt + (\u03c7\u2212 \u03c4 2)q + 2\u03b4qt = 0 , q \u2208 R2 , J =\n\u239b\n\u239d0 \u22121\n1 0\n\u239e\n\u23a0 , (2)\nwhere \u03c4 > 0 is the \u201cgyroscopic coe\ufb03cient\u201d, \u03c7 a real parameter with |\u03c7| \u0005 \u03c4 2, and\n\u03b4 \u2265 0.\nThe energy of the system (2) is strictly decreasing when \u03b4 > 0 and \u2016qt\u2016 > 0. Let\nq(t) = q\u0302e\u03bbt; then substitution into (2) leads to the roots\n\u03bb = i\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b4 \u00b1 i\n\u221a\n\u03c7 + 2i\u03c4\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b42 and \u03bb = \u2212i\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b4 \u00b1 i\n\u221a\n\u03c7\u2212 2i\u03c4\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b42 . (3)\nWhen \u03b4 = 0 there are four roots \u03bb = \u00b1i(\u03c4 \u00b1\u221a\u03c7). The eigenvalue movement shown\nin Figure 1 is realized as \u03c7 decreases from a positive value to a negative value, the\ncollision occurring at \u03c7 = 0. Suppose now \u03c7 is small and positive (just before the\ncollision) and look at the e\ufb00ect of dissipation on the two modes \u03bb0 = i\u03c4 \u00b1 i\u221a\u03c7.\nSubstitution of the eigenfunctions for these two eigenvalues into the energy shows\nthat the mode associated with i\u03c4\u2212i\u221a\u03c7 has negative energy while the mode associated\nwith i\u03c4 + i\n\u221a\n\u03c7 has positive energy.\n6\n\u03b4 = 0 \u03b4 > 0\nFIG. 2: Schematic of the e\ufb00ect of dissipation on the eigenvalues associated with (2).\nWith \u03b4 small, expand the \ufb01rst pair of roots in (3) in a Taylor series\n\u03bb(\u03b4) = i\u03c4 \u00b1 i\u221a\u03c7\u2213 \u03b4\u221a\n\u03c7\n(\u03c4 \u00b1\u221a\u03c7) +O(\u03b42) .\nWith 0 < \u03b4 \u0005 1 the eigenvalues are perturbed as shown to the right in Figure 2.\nThe negative energy mode, \u03bb0 = i(\u03c4 \u2212\u221a\u03c7), has positive real part when dissipatively\nperturbed, and the positive energy mode, \u03bb0 = i(\u03c4 +\n\u221a\n\u03c7), has negative real part\nunder perturbation. Consequently, when small dissipation is added to the otherwise\nstable system (that is, 0 < \u03c7 \u0005 \u03c4 2), the mode with negative energy will destabilize.\nAfter the collision (when \u03c7 < 0) the growth rate of the instability is enhanced.\nIt should be noted that other mathematically consistent forms of damping can be\nused. For example the uniform damping\nqt =\n\u2202H\n\u2202p\n\u2212 \u03b4q , pt = \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202q\n\u2212 \u03b4p , (4)\nmakes mathematical sense. But it leads to uniform contraction of the phase space,\nand does not destabilize negative energy modes.\nIn order to study the e\ufb00ect of dissipation on water waves, one could start with\nthe Navier-Stokes equations and perturb about the Stokes wave solution (see [8] for\ninstance for the case of wind forcing). Another approach is to add viscous pertur-\nbations to the potential \ufb02ow in various forms [29, 30]. From the modi\ufb01ed equations\none can derive a dissipative NLS equation. There are two issues to highlight: neg-\native energy modes can be destabilized and so the BF instability can be enhanced\nby dissipation, and secondly, the form of the damping is important. It is known\n7\nthat negative energy modes of the Euler equations can be destabilized by the form\nof damping found in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations [26].\nFollowing [8, 10], a general perturbed NLS equation for various types of physical\nsituations can be written in the form (1). The parameters a, b and c are taken to\nbe non-negative. When they are positive, they represent dissipative perturbations,\nsince the norm of the solution is strictly decreasing in time when a2 + b2 + c2 > 0.\nWhen a = b = c = 0, the resulting NLS equation is a Hamiltonian partial\ndi\ufb00erential equation; with A = u1 + iu2 and u = (u1, u2),\nJut = \u2207H(u) + aJuxx \u2212 bJu\u2212 c\u2016u\u20162Ju , (5)\nwhere J was de\ufb01ned in (2) and\nH(u) =\n\u222b\nR\n[\n1\n2\n\u03b1\u2016ux\u20162 \u2212 14\u03b3\u2016u\u20164\n]\ndx . (6)\nLet \u03b8(x, t) = kx \u2212 \u03c9t + \u03b80, and consider the basic travelling wave solution to (5)\nwhen dissipation is neglected,\nu\u0302(x, t) = R\u03b8(x,t)u0 , R\u03b8 =\n\u239b\n\u239dcos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\u239e\n\u23a0 . (7)\nThen u0, \u03c9, k satisfy \u2212\u03c9 + \u03b1k2 = \u03b3\u2016u0\u20162.\nIt is assumed that the Stokes travelling wave exists for a su\ufb03ciently long time\nbefore any dissipation can a\ufb00ect it: dissipation is taken to be a second order e\ufb00ect.\nNext we check the energetics of the BF stability problem in NLS. Linearize the\npartial di\ufb00erential equation (5) with a = b = c = 0 about the basic travelling wave\n(7). Letting u(x, t) = R\u03b8(x,t)(u0 +v(x, t)), substituting into the conservative version\nof (5), linearizing about u0, and simplifying leads to\nJvt + 2\u03b1kJvx + \u03b1vxx + 2\u03b3\u3008u0,v\u3009u0 = 0 , (8)\nwhere \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 is the standard scalar product on R2.\nThe class of solutions of interest are solutions which are periodic in x with\nwavenumber \u03c3. The parameter \u03c3 represents the sideband. The BF instability will\n8\nbe associated with the limit |\u03c3| \u0005 1. Therefore let\nv(x, t) = 1\n2\nv0(t) +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n(vn(t) cosn\u03c3x +wn(t) sinn\u03c3x) .\nNeglecting the \u03c3\u2212independent modes (superharmonic instability), the\n\u03c3\u2212dependent modes decouple into 4\u2212dimensional subspaces for each n, and\nsatisfy\nJv\u02d9n + 2\u03b1kn\u03c3Jwn \u2212 \u03b1(n\u03c3)2vn + 2\u03b3u0uT0 vn = 0\nJw\u02d9n \u2212 2\u03b1kn\u03c3Jvn \u2212 \u03b1(n\u03c3)2wn + 2\u03b3u0uT0wn = 0 .\n(9)\nWhen the amplitude \u2016u0\u2016 = 0, it is easy to show that all eigenvalues of the above\nsystem (i.e. taking solutions of the form e\u03bbt and computing \u03bb) are purely imaginary.\nConsidering all other parameters \ufb01xed, and increasing \u2016u0\u2016, we \ufb01nd that there is a\ncritical amplitude where the n = 1 mode becomes unstable \ufb01rst through a collision\nof eigenvalues of opposite signature.\nTo analyze this instability, take n = 1 and study the reduced four dimensional\nsystem\nJv\u02d91 + 2\u03b1k\u03c3Jw1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c32v1 + 2\u03b3u0uT0 v1 = 0\nJw\u02d91 \u2212 2\u03b1k\u03c3Jv1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c32w1 + 2\u03b3u0uT0w1 = 0 .\n(10)\nTo determine the spectrum, let (v1,w1) = (q,p)e\n\u03bbt. Then (\u03bb, \u03c3) are determined by\nroots of\n\u0394(\u03bb, \u03c3) = \u03bb4 + 2(p2 + 4k2\u03b12\u03c32)\u03bb2 + (p2 \u2212 4k2\u03b12\u03c32)2 ,\nwhere p2 = \u03b12\u03c34 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03b3\u2016u0\u20162\u03c32. Suppose p2 > 0, then all four roots are purely\nimaginary (see Figure 1) and given by\n\u03bb = i2\u03b1k\u03c3 \u00b1 ip and \u03bb = \u2212i2\u03b1k\u03c3 \u00b1 ip .\nThese modes are purely imaginary as long as p2 > 0; equivalently 2\u03b3\u03b1\u2016u0\u20162 < \u03b12\u03c32.\nSince \u03b1\u03b3 > 0, the instability threshold is achieved when the amplitude reaches\n\u2016u0\u2016 = |\u03b1\u03c3|\u221a\n2\u03b1\u03b3\n. (11)\n9\nAt this threshold, a collision of eigenvalues occurs at the points \u03bb = \u00b12ik\u03b1\u03c3; see\nFigure 1 for a schematic of this collision.\nIt will be assumed henceforth that k \r= 0. Then instability is through a collision\nof eigenvalues of opposite energy sign, which reproduces the instability mechanism\nfor the full water-wave problem.\nPurely imaginary eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian system have a signature associated\nwith them, and this signature is related to the sign of the energy [17, 18, 31]. Collision\nof eigenvalues of opposite signature is a necessary condition for the collision resulting\nin instability.\nIt is straightforward to compute the signature of the modes in the NLS model.\nSuppose that the amplitude \u2016u0\u2016 of the basic state is smaller than the critical value\n(11) for instability. Then there are two pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues, and\nthey each have a signature. Let us concentrate on the eigenvalues on the positive\nimaginary axis\n\u03bb = i\u03a9\u00b1 with \u03a9\u00b1 = cg\u03c3 \u00b1 p , cg = 2\u03b1k . (12)\nThen\nSign(\u03a9\u00b1) = i\u3008q,Jq\u3009+ i\u3008p,Jp\u3009 ,\nwhere the inner product is real in order to make the conjugation explicit. One can also\nshow that this signature has the same sign as the energy perturbation restricted to\nthis mode. A straightforward calculation shows that Sign(\u03a9\u00b1) = \u00b14 when \u2016u0\u2016 = 0.\nSince p2 decreases as the amplitude increases, the two modes will have opposite\nsignature for all \u2016u0\u2016 between \u2016u0\u2016 = 0 and the point of collision.\nNow consider the e\ufb00ect of the damping terms. Consider the reduced system (10)\nfor the BF instability with the abc\u2212damping terms included:\nJv\u02d91 + 2\u03b1k\u03c3Jw1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c32v1 + 2\u03b3u0uT0 v1 +D1 = 0\nJw\u02d91 \u2212 2\u03b1k\u03c3Jv1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c32w1 + 2\u03b3u0uT0w1 +D2 = 0 ,\n(13)\nwith\nD1 = 2ka\u03c3w1 + a\u03c32Jv1 + bJv1 + 2c\u3008u0,v1\u3009Ju0\nD2 = \u22122ka\u03c3v1 + a\u03c32Jw1 + bJw1 + 2c\u3008u0,w1\u3009Ju0 .\n(14)\n10\nNow, let (v1(t),w1(t)) = (v\u02dc1, w\u02dc1)e\n\u03bbt. Then the eigenvalue problem for the stability\nexponent reduces to studying the roots of a determinant showing (with the help of\nMaple) that the two roots in the upper half plane are given by\n\u03bb\u00b1 = 2ik\u03c3\u03b1\u2212 (b + a\u03c32 + c\u2016u0\u20162)\u00b1 i\n\u221a\nS , (15)\nwith\nS = 4ia\u03c33k\u03b1\u2212 c2\u2016u0\u20164 \u2212 4k2\u03c32a2 \u2212 4ia\u03c3k\u03b3\u2016u0\u20162 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03b3\u03c32\u2016u0\u20162 + \u03b12\u03c34 .\nWhen a = b = c = 0, these stability exponents reduce to\n\u03bb\u00b1 = 2ik\u03c3\u03b1\u00b1 i\n\u221a\n\u03b12\u03c34 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03b3\u03c32\u2016u0\u20162 .\nNow suppose these two eigenvalues are purely imaginary: the amplitude \u2016u0\u2016 is\nbelow the critical value (11). To determine the leading order e\ufb00ect of dissipation,\nexpand (15) in a Taylor series with respect to a, b and c and take the real part\nRe(\u03bb\u00b1) = \u2212(a\u03c32 + b + c\u2016u0\u20162)\u2213 2ak\u03c3(\u03b1\u03c3\n2 \u2212 \u03b3\u2016u0\u20162)\u221a\n\u03b12\u03c34 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03b3\u03c32\u2016u0\u20162\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (16)\nFor any a > 0 there is an open region of parameter space where these two real parts\nhave opposite sign since their product to leading order is\nRe(\u03bb\u2212)Re(\u03bb+) = (a\u03c32 + b + c\u2016u0\u20162)2 \u2212 4a\n2k2\u03c32(\u03b1\u03c32 \u2212 \u03b3\u2016u0\u20162)2\n\u03b12\u03c34 \u2212 2\u03b1\u03b3\u03c32\u2016u0\u20162 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nFor any a, b, c with a \r= 0 there is an open set of values of \u2016u0\u2016 where this expression\nis strictly negative, showing that Re(\u03bb\u2212) and Re(\u03bb+) perturb in opposite directions.\nIn this parameter regime the dissipation perturbs the negative energy mode as shown\nschematically in Figure 2.\nIt is clear that when only the b\u2212term is present all eigenvalues shift to the left.\nTherefore the b\u2212term does not produce any enhancement of the instability, in agree-\nment with [12]. This damping is analogous to the uniform damping in (4). It is the\na\u2212term which leads to enhancement. However the NLS is a simpli\ufb01ed model for\nwater waves.\n11\nIn summary, the fundamental observation is that BF instability is associated with\na collision of eigenvalues of positive and negative energy, and there are physically\nrealizable forms of damping which enhance this instability. It remains to be seen\nhow this e\ufb00ect can be revealed in laboratory experiments, in numerical experiments\nbased on the full water-wave equations, and in the open ocean.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was enhanced by a grant of a CNRS Fellowship to the \ufb01rst author, and by\nsupport from the CMLA at Ecole Normale Supe\u00b4rieure de Cachan.
