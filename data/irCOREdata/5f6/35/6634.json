Staff to student ratios have increased to the point where it has\nbecome impractical for small group tutorials to take place. This position has affected job\nsatisfaction and caused increasing doubts over the effectiveness of large group lectures for\nstudent learning. Furthermore, it has been recognized that over the last ten years the make-\nup of the student population has radically changed, leading to a larger proportion of 'non-\ntraditional' students such as mature students with family responsibilities. Related to this,\nmany students are now in part-time or even full-time employment. It is recognized that\nboth these groups require greater flexibility in the time and place of their learning.\nMany universities are moving towards open or flexible learning to attract students from\nother parts of the country or abroad to study their courses locally. This is part of a wider\ntrend towards the 'Virtual University' (Daniel, 1996) which can support learning across\n38\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\ntime and distance. The UK Open University has been a major influence in this area but the\napproach is entering into mainstream use as communications technology advances and\nbecomes more widely available. For instance the University of Salford is involved in the\nGEMISIS 2000 project which has education as a major theme (details are available online,\nhttp:\/\/www.gemisis.co.uk\/services-education.html) and the planned national 'Education\nSuperhighway' is based on similar assumptions of using advanced communications\ntechnology to assist teaching and learning.\nThe above factors indicate the need for academics to engage with the various technologies\nand evaluate their effectiveness in a variety of teaching situations and the information\nsystems community is ideally placed to do this. This paper introduces such an evaluation in\nthe form of a case study of the use of the World Wide Web (WWW) and computer\nconferencing for campus-based teaching and learning. The paper discusses the findings of\nthe case study using accepted research from the field of collaborative systems (Orlikowski,\n1992; Grudin, 1994). This research is used as a framework for reflection and to make some\ntentative conclusions for future work.\nTechnological possibilities\n'New technology is changing the way information is stored and transmitted. This has\nimplications for both the skills which higher education needs to develop and the way in\nwhich it is delivered' (Dealing, 1997).\nComputerized delivery mechanisms for distance learning have been on the higher\neducational agenda since the 1970s. With regard to computers and education, the teaching\nof children has always been more prolific in the educational literature. The limited value of\nearly stand-alone computer-aided instruction systems was disappointing for many and led\nto disillusionment with the idea of Skinner's 'teaching machine'. The promise of the later\ndevelopments in computer-aided learning based on the work of Seymour Papert did not\ncause the revolution in the classroom it promised (Boyle, 1996). There is now feverish\noptimism in both secondary and higher educational circles largely due to the rapid\nassimilation of mass networking involving the Internet and associated learning approaches\nusing the WWW. Mason (1998) identifies four broad categories into which current\neducational technologies can be divided:\n\u2022 text-based systems, including electronic mail\n\u2022 conferencing, real-time chat systems and many uses of the WWW\n\u2022 audio-conferencing and audio extensions such as audiographics, and audio on the\nInternet\n\u2022 video-conferencing, one-way and two-way and other visual media such as video-clips\non the WWW.\nEducation is viewed by many as the 'killer application' for interactive multimedia; when\nliberated from the CD ROM by the WWW it is seen as enabling mass, global access to\ninteractive learning resources. Bates (1993) sums up the optimism: 'technological\ndevelopments already available or in the pipeline have the potential to revolutionise\neducation and training as we know it.'\n39\nBrian Nicholson A case study of campus-based flexible learning using the World Wide Web and computer conferencing\nUse of the WWW as a medium for teaching: a case study\nLargely as a reaction to educational trends, a new ten-credit module was developed for the\nITI undergraduate degree in IT entitled 'Developing Systems for Teaching and Learning'.\nThis was broadly concerned with exploring the development of information systems for\nteaching and learning. This module was ideally placed to give students exposure to a wide\nvariety of teaching and learning approaches and encourage reflection on their relative\neffectiveness. There was a desire to investigate the potential of emerging technology and\nreflect on experiences.\nAims and objectives\nThe following were considered to be the guiding objectives for the investigation:\n\u2022 To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using web-based online interactive\nlearning resources and conferencing to facilitate learning.\nLeading to the following outcomes:\n\u2022 A prototype 'learning environment' for the new module, which would include a mixture\nof online interactive materials, a conferencing system, course materials and access to\nother open learning resources.\n\u2022 A report exploring the feasibility of using web-based resources and conferencing to\nsupport student learning.\nThe overarching research question guiding the enquiry was concerned with:\n\u2022 How effective are advanced communication technologies in supporting campus-based\nstudent learning?\nEvaluation approach\nIn order to evaluate the system and the process the author consulted Baric (1998), Boyle\n(1996) and Reeves and Harmon (1995). The emphasis was on qualitative evaluation which\nwould lead to insights regarding the effectiveness of the module teaching and learning\nstrategy. The web site was built around general systems development lifecycle principles\nwith an analysis, design and implementation phase. In line with the rapid prototyping\nmethodology, sections of the system were built and demonstrated. This led to an\nunderpinning critique, new ideas and insights. For instance this process resulted in the\ndesign and development of several interactive animations. In this way evaluation\ncommenced at an early stage with discussion over the appropriateness of the structure and\nscreen designs. Prior to 'going live' the online materials were examined and tested by\nstudent groups.\nStudents were involved directly in evaluation activities as a result of their coursework\ncomponents. Two student teams performed an evaluation of the module web site as part of\ntheir assessed coursework and all students were required to reflect on the success and\nappropriateness of the various teaching and learning approaches used in the module. Two\nfocus group sessions were held during the course of the module and although these were\nnot taped, copious notes were taken. Tutorials and workshops each week led to informal\nevaluation material and several semi-structured interviews took place with students at\n40\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nvarious stages throughout the course. The author also kept a diary of observations of the\nsystem in use, conversations and thoughts that occurred during the course of the module.\nFinally, an online questionnaire was produced to gauge student opinion. The course team\nalso carefully examined course work submissions to judge whether students had met the\nlearning outcomes utilizing the teaching and learning approach adopted.\nComponents of the online delivery\nThis section will outline the components of the course and explain how the technology was\nused to support the teaching and learning. It is divided into the following aspects of the\ncourse: administration, interactive web-based learning, computer conferencing and\nassessment. The module is a third-year undergraduate option and was taken by 34\nstudents. There were no formal classroom-based lectures although there were regular small\ngroup tutorials.\nAdministration of the course\nThe web site was instrumental in the administration of the course. It contained all of the\nsyllabus and assignment details as well as times and venue information and was also used\nfor other administrative matters such as recording names of group participants and group\nresponsibilities for attendance, presentations and peer assessment. Peer assessment\nschedules and forms were stored online. Students found this useful as they 'knew where\nthey stood' from the start with regard to expectations and did not need to worry about lost\ninformation or filing papers. The newsgroup became the official mechanism for\ncommunication about the course administration issues.\nWeb-based learning\nThe use of the WWW to deliver teaching and learning material is still in its infancy, yet two\ndistinct major approaches can be seen to be developing:\n\u2022 WWW-based materials to support learning via access to resources. This takes the form\nof lists of links, resources, lecture notes, etc. This is meant to supplement other\nteaching and learning approaches such as lectures, etc.\n\u2022 WWW-based materials as the main medium for teaching and learning. This could take\nthe form of online open or distance learning materials designed to act as the main\nmedium through which teaching and learning will take place. Other methods such as\nlectures or seminars would be supplementary or complementary to the online\nmaterials.\nThere was no desire to move to a distance learning approach as the course is campus-based\nand students are regularly on campus. However, the teaching and learning strategy was\nbuilt around this strategy supplemented by face-to-face small group tutorials. The tutorials\nwere designed to be used for evaluation and to engage with the issues discussed on the web\nsite to reinforce understanding. There was also a need to evaluate the need for tutorials.\nThus the course team was not attempting to emulate distance learning approaches but to\nsupplement with a view to realizing deep learning and teach larger numbers of students\nmore effectively.\nThe web site contained materials covering the key educational theories to design IT\nsystems for teaching and learning. The detailed information was followed by questions and\n41\nBrian Nicholson A case studyof campus-based flexible learning using the World Wide Web and computer conferencing\ntasks for the students to complete in a similar flexible learning format to that\nrecommended by Race (1993). In particular, the 'self-assessed questions' prescribed by\nRace were replaced by a request to submit responses to tasks and questions to the course\nnewsgroup (the 'virtual seminar') for discussion with the rest of the group thus creating an\n'online' seminar. To make this as seamless an experience as possible, a 'go to virtual\nseminar' icon was placed alongside the question or task to bring up the newsgroup window\nready to accept discourse. This aspect of the course was designed to offer potential for\nonline interactive discussion, thereby building on the static paper-based open learning\napproach as prescribed by Race (1993).\nComputer conferencing\nThe use of asynchronous news group technology was chosen as a practical means to allow\nstudents to discuss the web-based learning materials and then to respond to the questions\nand tasks while separated by time and\/or distance. Newsgroups were used due to the\nunavailability of synchronous communication software and the relative robustness of\nnewsgroups. In parallel with the open learning resources, it was felt that this would provide\ngreater flexibility of time and place for discussion and would facilitate more learning\nexperiences and opportunities for reflection. The course newsgroup contained two 'rooms' -\none named the' 'virtual seminar' and another named the 'virtual coffee room'. The coffee\nroom was intended for informal communication and the 'seminar' for discussion of course\nmaterials and matters directly linked to the module.\nAssessment\nThe course web site was used for submission of student work. Students were invited to\nsubmit their evaluations as a series of linked web pages that would be accessible via the\nweb site. The team evaluations were open to all and were peer-assessed by another team\n(who used the virtual seminar as a means of interrogating the team being assessed).\nAnalysis and discussion\nThe analysis of the results of the case study is divided under the general headings of the\naccessibility and functionality of resources, quantity and clarity, motivation and feedback\nissues and finally teamworking and co-operative interaction. The discussion refers to\naccepted research from the area of collaborative systems (Grudin, 1994; Orlikowski, 1992)\nto reinforce the validity of the findings.\nAccessibility and functionality\nThe site was accessible via the WWW, creating independence from the conf\u00ednes of the\nuniversity and allowing access at any time. Every student had at least one method of\naccessing the pages, which could be online at the ITI, at home via an Internet Service\nProvider (ISP), off-line at home by copying the files onto a home machine and off-line by\nprinting out the information and using the hardcopy for reference. The questionnaire and\ninterview findings showed that most students were using the materials at home in an off-line\nmode, and only a small number accessed the materials online at the ITI. Critically, this\nmeant that those students accessing the web pages off-line did not have instantaneous access\nto the virtual seminar to post queries and engage in discourse. This had a significant effect\non the success of this element of the course. Interviews indicated that the virtual seminar\ndebates had often finished before the 'off-line' students couid usefully contribute. Unless the\n42\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nseminar was 'close at hand' students forgot to submit or would lose the thread of their\nthoughts due to the time lag between working on the materials and actually inputting their\nresponse. Grudin (1994) makes the point that to be successful, accessibility to the features\nthat support group processes must be unobtrusive. In this case, the very benefit of flexibility\nfor the students via home off-line access led to the group discourse support process\nbecoming impractical. This was a fundamental problem as it caused difficulties in achieving\nand maintaining the 'critical mass' of users to make it continuously beneficial.\nQuantity and clarity\nIssues of the quantity and the clarity of the information presented on the web pages were\nof relevance as a source of comparison and of indications of the success of the online\nlearning. Issues of quantity were prevalent:\nWe felt swamped by the amount of information. The voluminous amounts of informa-\ntion are overwhelming, Web-based material is overloaded with too much information.\nScaling them down to the main points and making it open for discussion would be more\neffective.\nThe qualitative section of the questionnaire indicates similar feelings when compared with\nother ITI module workloads. With regard to the virtual seminar, the newsgroup conference\nuses threaded discussions offering the opportunity to discuss topics and for several debates\nto take place at once. Those who did submit to the virtual seminar made impressive\ncontributions with some students thoroughly enjoying submitting their ideas. A number of\ngroup submissions occurred in response to the online questions contained in the course\nonline materials. However, students who did not use the resource regularly due to access\ndifferences (discussed above) found reading the 'voluminous' contributions to the virtual\nseminar impossible and this only contributed to the feelings of being 'swamped'.\nThis factor can be related to discussion of the adoption process (Grudin, 1994) in that the\nintroduction of the materials did not take account of students being used to stage delivery\nof content. Students are socially accustomed to the idea of a regular timed meeting\nbetween lecturer and student. This is reflected in questionnaire responses that also indicate\nthe importance of tutorials. Clearly the 'big bang' adoption process used in this case\nignored the embedded custom and expectation of students and the critical effect of online \/\noff-line access methods.\nMotivation and feedback\nThe initial set of problems concerned access to the materials and technical difficulties. At\nleast one student dropped out of the module stating the reason for this as feeling\nuncomfortable with the module being delivered by technological means. Students\nexperienced technical difficulties getting access to the resources in some cases as well as\nnavigation around the system. However there was a surprising lack of technical problems\nonce the initial 'access denied' type difficulties had been overcome in week one. Comments\nduring this period included:\nThere was no reward for the effort of using the web-based resource and we were\ntherefore not motivated to try hard.\nI felt uncomfortable adjusting to the computer as teaching medium as opposed to\ncomputer as a tool.\n43\nBrian Nicho\/son A case study of campus-based flexible learning using the World Wide Web and computer conferencing\nI felt demotivated by the volume of information.\nAlthough they were initially enthused by the novelty of using different teaching techniques,\nthere were considerable problems with motivation regarding the virtual seminar. In order\nto encourage participation in the virtual seminar, an assessment incentive of 5 per cent was\nawarded for the online contributions. As students worked through the notes online there\nwere numerous contributors with some excellent comments. However, it was found that the\nstudents were not engaging in dialogue in the virtual seminar but were simply responding\nto the questions in the online materials and posting the answers. After the initial period,\n'active' students did not see any further benefit in continued posting of their ideas and\nusage of the newsgroup tailed off steeply after weeks three and four. During weeks four\nand five, there were still open-learning-type tasks and questions online but the readings\nwere paper-based and by this time the virtual seminar activity had largely tailed off. The\nsecond half of the course moved to action learning with a number of continuous\nassessments driving the curriculum. This period saw use of the conference limited to\npragmatic course information issues and a few subversive comments from anonymous\nstudents.\nInterviews included the following:\nWe posted an amount that we regarded to be sufficient for our marks.\nSome students have said that they resented the use of this 5% (incentive) so much that\nthey essentially boycotted the virtual seminar altogether.\nThe questionnaire results indicate that many students were 'lurking'. The conclusion\nappears to be that staff intervention was required to give the virtual seminar a sense of\npurpose and benefit in the student view. Interviews indicate that the students accepted the\nidea of interactive discussion but they wanted feedback on their submissions from the\ncourse team to keep participation up. There was a prevailing view that face-to-face\ntutorials were essential to learning, and that the virtual seminar experience would be\ninsufficient to support sophisticated learning (which needs dialogue).\nThis general finding from the virtual seminar is in line with the work of Grudin (1994) and\nOrlikowski (1992) who state that groupware users must perceive a direct benefit for their\nadditional work or participation will decline. Orlikowski (1992) discusses the importance\nof encouraging information sharing through reward structures. The 5 per cent motivation\nto 'kick start' the conference tailed off because of lack of perceived sustained benefit. After\nthe initial novelty had worn off students were waiting for added value, which could have\nbeen in the form of input from the lecturers to validate and comment on the materials\npresented in the seminar. Thus there was a disparity in work and benefit and a critical mass\nof users was not in place. Additional work was required from individuals who did not\nperceive a direct benefit from the use of the application.\nTeamworking and co-operative interaction\nA high degree of teamworking was necessary within the module. This occurred in several\ndifferent environments including lectures, tutorials, assignment groupwork and the virtual\nseminar. There was a mix of students accessing the materials alone and in their groups and\ndue to the large volume of text-based background and reference material required for the\ncourse, some teams distributed workload between team members. The extent to which this\n4 4 , \u2022\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nwas successful depended upon the level of organization within individual teams, breaking\ndown sections of the site and sharing their experiences with the team. The idea of putting\nthe student evaluation pages on a web site followed by an online critique using the virtual\nseminar available to all proved to be a very powerful learning device and a real success of\nthe virtual seminar. However, interviews with students indicated three types of virtual\nseminar users. There are those who read but do not contribute in order to 'poach' extra\nmarks, those who are genuinely interested and contribute readily and those who ignore it\nbut submit something for the 5 per cent.\nIt is noteworthy that the ITI is a collaboration between business, industry and academia\nand therefore reflects a commercial competitive ethos. Lecturers often display a laissez-\nfaire attitude and students are openly seen to 'sink or swim' in the environment. Interviews\nrevealed that student teams often feel in competition for marks: 'The theme introduced by\nthe course team of student teams working towards a common goal in a non-competitive\nenvironment was unfamiliar to many students.'\nGrudin (1994) suggests that groupware will be unsuccessful if it disrupts social processes,\ni.e. violates social taboos, threatens existing political structures or otherwise d\u00e9motiv\u00e2tes\nusers. Interviews suggest the limited use of the virtual seminar is a result partly of typical\nstudent competition but also reflects a commercial ethos engendered by the ITI, which\ncauses some teams not to share information. This is reinforced by the work of Orlikowski\n(1992) who encountered similar results with the use of Lotus Notes in a management\nconsultancy.\nConclusions and implications for future work\nIn the author's opinion, the strategy of building educational networks using a flexible\nlearning format is feasible and overcomes some of the problems over flexibility, time and\nplace and large numbers of students. It also offers the possibility of incorporating\ninteractivity via the virtual seminar and with multimedia, video-clips etc. There are\nfundamental issues from this case of use to those involved in building educational\nnetworks. The 'big bang' implementation in this case study did not take into account the\nsocial customs and expectations that students had regarding the delivery of content.\nIntroducing new methods of teaching and learning such as this need to be introduced\ngradually. The use of tutorial support to supplement learners should account for different\nlearning styles. Students need to be given some clear guidance and education on how they\nshould use the materials and the philosophy of flexible learning.\nIt is felt that the use of the web site for placing detailed information followed by questions\nand tasks to be submitted to the virtual seminar was an effective idea for some groups.\nCritically, the various access methods affected the closeness at hand and seamlessness of\nposting to the virtual seminar thereby affecting the level of discourse. It is difficult to\nsuggest solutions other than to make this issue plain to the students and discuss the\nadvantages of the virtual seminar together with access options.\nThere was also little motivation to engage in discourse partly due to off-line access\nmethods. The time lag between reading and posting meant many students did not bother to\nsubmit or felt swamped by the discourse or disappointed when a stream of discourse had\nalready begun and ended. Students need to be encouraged to browse the seminar regularly\n4S\nBrian Nicholson A case study of campus-based flexible learning using the World Wide Web and computer conferencing\nand make it an accepted part of the teaching and learning. Competitive cultural factors\nand lack of staff involvement in the virtual seminar also contributed to motivation\ndifficulties in this case. This issue may be resolved by the course team dedicating part of the\ncontact to online tutoring or alternatively by setting up themed conferences lasting for a\nparticular period of time.\nThere is also the issue of development time for courses delivered in this manner. The\nestimate for development time was roughly three hours' development time for every one\nhour of student exercises. This is costly but it is hoped that costs will be recouped over time\ndue to efficiencies gained.\nClearly careful consideration of students' workload, time and staging of content is\nessential to avoid students feeling overloaded. One strategy is for early content to be\nstructured in a week-by-week format rather than organizing material by topic, giving\nstudents more structure, until they become accustomed to the format. This structure\nshould gradually diminish as the task drives the learning.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author acknowledges the financial support of the University of Salford Teaching and\nLearning Quality Improvement Scheme.
