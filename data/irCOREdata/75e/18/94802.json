Fear of crime is \nwidely recognised as a significant social and political problem. Yet while numerous studies have \nsought to explain why some people worry more about falling victim than other people (for \nreviews, see Hale, 1996; Vanderveen, 2007; and Farrall, Jackson, & Gray, 2007), the research \nliterature lacks a convincing psychological perspective on vulnerability. While theoretical \nadvances have been made \u2013 and while studies have addressed various aspects of the public \nperception of risk \u2013 we lack any empirical assessment of a psychological account of perceived \nsusceptibility to crime. Such a perspective promises to explain both high levels of general public \nanxiety and why some individuals worry more than others: crime may be one of those risks that is \nseen by some to be especially likely (for themselves and for their social group), especially \nuncontrollable in its event, and especially serious in its impact and consequence. \nIn order to assess this perspective, a survey of residents of two London neighbourhoods \ntests the twin-hypotheses that gender and age differences in fear of crime are due to (a) different \nperceptions of the likelihood of victimisation (for oneself and for one\u2019s social group) and (b) \ndifferent perceptions of control over the event and anticipations of the extent of impact. By testing \nthese hypotheses \u2013 based on the premise that these components of vulnerability explain both why \nfemales worry more frequently than males and why certain age groups worry more frequently than \nother age groups \u2013 the paper develops a more powerful definition of vulnerability in the fear of \ncrime: markers of vulnerability (e.g. gender) are associated with higher levels of fear through \nmediating assessments of risk and susceptibility (Killias, 1990). \nCriminologists have long debated the relationship between crime and fear (Biderman, \nJohnson, McIntyre, & Weir, 1967; Skogan, 1981; Hough & Mayhew, 1983; Tyler & Cook, 1984; \nStanko, 1985; Sacco & Glackman, 1987; Sparks, 1992; Hough, 1995; Hale, 1996; Bilsky & \nWetzels, 1997; Vanderveen, 2007). As research enters its fourth decade it is striking how the same \nthemes \u2013 beginning with reports from a series of US government funded crime survey (e.g. \nBiderman et al., 1967) \u2013 have persisted in much of the research and subsequent debate (Hale, \n1996; Warr, 2000): first, more people feel at risk than are likely to fall victim (in any given year); \nand second, personal experience of victimisation and actual crime rates are only weakly correlated \nwith fear.  \nGiven the weak relationship between crime and fear, scholars have unsurprisingly looked \nelsewhere for explanations. Thus far it has been difficult to isolate unambiguous effects of the \nmass media (Hale, 1996; Ditton, Chadee, Farrall., Gilchrist, & Bannister, 2004). Instead perhaps \nthe strongest evidence relates to the importance of public concerns about neighbourhood disorder, \nsocial cohesion and collective efficacy (Ferraro, 1995; Perkins & Taylor, 1996; Jackson, 2004; \nWyant, 2008). The idea here is that the incidence and risk of crime has become coupled in the \npublic mind with issues of social stability, moral consensus and the collective informal control \nprocesses which underpin neighbourhood order (Bannister, 1993; Walklate, 1998; Girling, Loader, \n& Sparks, 2000; Jackson, 2006). So not only do these \u2018day-to-day\u2019 issues (\u2018young people hanging \naround\u2019, \u2018poor community spirit\u2019, \u2018low levels of trust and cohesion\u2019) produce information about \nrisk and generate a sense of unease, insecurity and distrust in the environment (cf. Warr, 1990; \nWalklate, 1998; Innes, 2004; Jackson, Farrall, & Gray, 2007); many people use the language of \n\u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018crime\u2019 to express concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of moral \nauthority, and the crumbling of civility and social capital (Taylor, 1995, 1996; Girling et al., 2000; \nJackson, 2008).1  \n                                                 \n1 In addition to this, recent criminological debate has also focused on feedback loops where politicians, \nmedia and research contribute to a culture of fear, leading individuals to (a) view the world more and more \nthrough the lens of crime, security and safety, and (b) demand more and more punitive policy from \nGovernment (Lee, 2007, 2001, 1999; Simon, 2007; Zedner, 2003; Furedi, 2006). Other debates have \nconsidered the importance of making sense of individual biographies when exploring the fear of crime \n(Hollway & Jefferson, 1997) and the refinement of the measurement of fear of crime (Farrall et al., 1997; \nFarrall & Gadd, 2004; Jackson, 2005; Sutton & Farrall, 2005, 2008; Miller, 2007; Gray et al., 2008a, \n2008b). For recent broad-brush summaries of debates on fear of crime, see: Lee (2007), Farrall et al. (2007), \nLee & Farrall (2008) and Walklate & Mythen (2008). \n 3\nBut an important and complementary perspective holds that personal vulnerability \u2013 \ndefined here as differential perception of likelihood, control and consequence \u2013 operates alongside \nprocesses of social perception (cf. Killias, 1990; Hale, 1996; Smith & Torstensson, 1997; \nVanderveen, 2007; Farrall et al., 2007). Interpretations of the social and physical environment \nprovide information about risk to observers (Ferraro, 1995). Yet the specific psychological \nproperties of risk perception may extend beyond the sense of likelihood to include multi-\ndimensional assessments of risk. Because of high-profile media coverage and widespread signs of \ndisorder, crime may be seen by many as a salient, vivid and relatively likely risk \u2013 one that is \nespecially difficult to control and especially dramatic in its impact. Such perceived susceptibility \u2013 \nthe feeling that one and one\u2019s social group are especially likely to be targeted by criminals; the \nfeeling that crime would have especially serious consequences; and the feeling of little control \nover the event \u2013 might affect certain groups disproportionately, thus playing a crucial role in both \nthe production and distribution of fear.  \nAs Hale (1996: 95) argues:  \n \n\u2018Any model trying to explain fear will include some notion of vulnerability. At a \ncommon sense level people who feel unable to protect themselves, either because \nthey cannot run fast, or lack the physical prowess to ward off attackers, or because \nthey cannot afford to protect their homes, or because it would take them longer than \naverage to recover from material or physical injuries might be expected to \u2018fear\u2019 \ncrime more than others. Three broad groups have been identified as falling into this \ncategory: women, the elder and the poor.\u2019  \n \nTo be sure, there have been theoretical advances on the meaning of vulnerability (Garofalo, 1981; \nPerloff, 1983; Killias, 1990; cf. Gabriel & Greve, 2003 Jackson, 2006). There have also been \nseparate empirical advances in the role of public perceptions of the likelihood and consequence of \nvictimisation (see inter alia: Warr, 1984, 1986, 1987; Vrij & Winkel, 1991; Denkers & Winkel, \n1998a, 1998b; Winkel, Blaauw, Sheridan, & Baldry, 2003; Winkel, 1998). Yet no study has \nintegrated existing psychological theory on fear of crime (e.g. Gabriel & Greve, 2003; Jackson, \n2006) to extend a multi-dimensional conception of vulnerability that spans the full range of risk \nappraisals. Killias (1990) suggests that there are physical, social and situational aspects of \nvulnerability which are then related to \u2018dimensions of threat\u2019 that cover \u2018exposure to non-\nnegligible risk\u2019, a \u2018loss of control\u2019, and \u2018seriousness of consequences.\u2019 For example, more serious \nconsequences are expected to occur amongst women, the elderly and people in bad health \n(physical factors), amongst victims without networks of social support (social factors), and in \ndeserted areas where no help is available (situational factors).  \nSo far however, no study has defined the mechanisms that underpin vulnerability as \nperceived likelihood, control and consequence, and tested whether gender and age effects \n(markers of vulnerability according to Killias, 1990 and Hale, 1996) can be explained by the sense \nof likelihood of victimisation (\u2018am I likely to fall victim?\u2019, \u2018are people like me especially likely to \nfall victim?\u2019), the perceived impact of victimisation (\u2018what will happen if I fall victim?\u2019, \u2018how will \nI cope with the impact?\u2019), and a sense of control over these uncertain events (\u2018can I avoid \nsituations where I might fall victim?\u2019, \u2018might I be able to deal with any problems should they \narise?\u2019). This study attempts to fill that gap. Along the way, disparate theoretical and empirical \nadvances (principally Perloff, 1983, Warr, 1987, Killias, 1990, Winkel, 1998, Killias & Clerici, \n2000, Gabriel & Greve, 2003, and Jackson, 2006) are integrated, and a meditational model of \nvulnerability is assessed which identifies the strength of direct and indirect effects of Killias\u2019s \n(1990) \u2018dimensions of threat\u2019 on worry about crime.  \n \nContext to the study \nInsights into the nature and impact of vulnerability and risk perception promise to shed light on \nvexed notions of rationality in the fear of crime (cf. Sparks, 1992, and Lee, 2007). Given the \nnegative impact on individual and community well being \u2013 and given the loose relationship to \nobjective risk \u2013 the fear of crime is often seen as a social problem in its own right, separate from \ncrime itself. And this view has led policy makers and criminal justice practitioners to ask whether \n 4\nthe public have a misplaced and exaggerated sense of the scope and priority of the threat due to \nsensational mass media coverage that instils a poor understanding of the reality of crime.2  \nOften the debate focuses on specific groups such as females and the elderly: are they \nespecially prone to shrill media reports and misrepresentations of the risk of crime? There is \nstrong evidence that females report higher levels of \u2018worry\u2019 or \u2018fear\u2019 of becoming a victim of \npersonal crime than males (or are more likely to report feeling unsafe alone after dark) despite the \nfact that men are more likely to fall victim (Baumer, 1978, 1985; Skogan & Maxfield, 1981; Warr, \n1984, 1985; Box, Hale, & Andrews, 1988; Ferraro, 1995). While recent work has questioned \nwhether this is partly because men suppress the extent of their fears \u2013 compared to females, males \nmay be less willing to express their concerns and anxieties (Sutton & Farrall, 2005, 2008; Sutton, \nRobinson, & Farrall, 2008) \u2013 debates about \u2018female fear\u2019 remain topical. Similar discussion has \naddressed the relationship between fear and age. Studies have shown that older people tend to \nreport feeling less safe walking alone in their neighbourhood after dark than younger people do \n(Hale, 1996). While surveys which ask individuals about their worries about particular crime types \noften find that the age-fear relationship reverses (LaGrange & Ferraro, 1987; Chadee & Ditton, \n2003; Nicholas, Kershaw, & Walker, 2007) the question of rationality again remains applicable.  \nA common riposte to the charge of irrationality is that those groups who express most \nconcern (for example, women and the elderly) actually have greater \u2018self-perceived vulnerability \nto victimization and its more serious outcomes\u2019 (Skogan, 1986: 210; see also Skogan & Maxfield, \n1981; Riger & Gordon, 1981; Stanko, 1997; Hollander, 2001). So \u2013 the argument goes \u2013 it is not \nthat women (or older people) have a misplaced sense of risk and therefore an irrational level of \nfear. Instead women\/older people are more sensitive to the consequences of victimisation than \nmen\/younger people, and less able to control its occurrence. Perhaps they feel less able to \nphysically defend themselves? Perhaps they associate one crime with the prospect of another more \nserious crime (Warr, 1985, 1987; Sacco & Glackman, 1987; Ferraro, 1995)?3 This issue has been \nmuch discussed in the literature (e.g. Skogan & Maxfield, 1981; Garofalo, 1981; Hale, 1996; \nVanderveen, 2007). Indeed, empirical evidence has supported the idea that \u2018\u2026women\u2019s greater \nlevels of fear lies in their heightened perceptions of personal vulnerability\u2019 (Hale, 1996: 97) so \nlong as one defines vulnerability as the perceived seriousness of the crime (Warr, 1987) or the \n\u2018shadow of sexual assault\u2019 (Ferraro, 1995, 1996).  \n \n                                                 \n2 Two alternative perspectives on rationality in the fear of crime are of note. First, Richard Sparks and \ncolleagues have argued that the narrow focus on the relationship between crime and fear has drawn attention \naway from the more intriguing nature of public sensibilities to crime. Not only is it difficult to fashion a \nyard-stick that measures what level of fear is \u2018rational\u2019 according to what level of objective risk (Sparks, \n1994). Rationality debates obviate an analysis of the broader social and cultural significance of crime, social \norder and change (Girling et al., 2000) and the relations between \u2018people\u2019s fears, feelings and dispositions \ntowards crime and punishment and the shifting political cultures in which they reside\u2019 (Hope and Sparks, \n2000: 3). Second, Stephen Farrall and colleagues have suggested that standard measures of the fear of crime \nin fact elide two \u2018dimensions\u2019 of fear: (a) everyday moments of worry; and (b) some more diffuse or \n\u2018ambient\u2019 anxiety about risk. Existing measures of worry about crime \u2013 such as those fielded by the British \nCrime Survey series \u2013 regularly show between 30% and 50% of the population of England and Wales \nexpress some kind of worry about being robbed, burgled or falling victim of some other crime (e.g. Nicholas \net al., 2007). However when one probes respondents further one finds that the number of individuals who \nworry on an everyday basis is actually quite a bit smaller (Gray et al., in press; Farrall and Gadd, 2004; \nFarrall et al., 1997). Moreover everyday worry about crime is relatively strongly associated with levels of \ncrime and victimisation experience and is a greater drain on people\u2019s quality of life than more ambient \ninsecurities (Jackson et al., 2007).  \n3 Gordon and Riger (1989) argue that men and women think about personal safety in different ways. This \ncould be down to differing processes of socialisation, particularly regarding sexual vulnerability (Hamner \nand Saunders, 1984), with Stanko (1995: 50) arguing that sexual violence is a \u2018core component of being \nfemale and is experienced through a wide range of everyday, mundane situations.\u2019 Hollander (2001: 84) \ndevelops this perspective with the assertion that vulnerability to violence is also a core part of being female \nand dangerous is a core part of being male \u2013 \u2018these ideas are pervasive, widely shared, and constructed \nthrough interaction: through routine patterns of behaviour and communication that replicate and reinforce \nexisting ideas about gender.\u2019 \n 5\nWhat is \u2018vulnerability\u2019?  \nBut more work is needed if we are to develop a richer psychological perspective on vulnerability \u2013 \none which includes a more complete range of public perceptions of risk. In particular we lack \nempirical evidence for the idea that gender\/age differences (markers of vulnerability according to \nKillias, 1990) can be explained by differential susceptibility to the event and impact of \nvictimisation. Before we begin however, it is important to review previous approaches to \nvulnerability. This will clear up a good deal of definitional confusion in the literature. It will also \nhelp motivate the current contribution.  \n In one of the first definitions advanced, Perlof (1983: 43) defined \u2018perceived vulnerability\u2019 \nbroadly \u2013 as \u2018a belief that one is susceptible to future negative outcomes and unprotected from \ndanger or misfortune. Accompanying this cognition is an affective component, consisting of \nfeelings of anxiety, fear and apprehension.\u2019 In her theoretical paper, she considered whether non-\nvictims tend to have an \u2018illusion of invulnerability\u2019, particularly in relation to seeing themselves as \nless vulnerable than others (\u2018it is not likely to happen to me \u2026 it happens to other people, not me \n\u2026\u2019; cf. Weinstein, 1980). She suggested that this judgement of relative risk might be related to (a) \nan \u2018illusion of control\u2019 (an exaggerated sense of the ability to control uncertain events; cf. Langer, \n1975) and (b) to \u2018downwards comparison\u2019 (where we compare ourselves to others who are more at \nrisk than we are because it makes us feel better or we have an unrealistic stereotype of others who \nfall victim; cf. Wills, 1981, Weinstein, 1980).4 In a subsequent study Perlof and Fetzer (1986) \noperationalised \u2018perceived vulnerability to victimization\u2019 more narrowly, measuring it via relative \nrisk judgements (e.g. \u2018In your view, are you more or less likely to fall victim than other \npeople?\u2019).5 Early conceptions of vulnerability to criminal victimisation thus focused on \nrelative judgements of likelihood. But in an important (again theoretical) paper, Killias (1990) \nbroadened the concept\u2019s scope to include a range of personal, social and situational aspects \n(markers of vulnerability such as being of poor health, having few financial resources, or indeed \nbeing female or elderly) which he then linked to three key \u2018dimensions of threat\u2019: perceived \nexposure to risk, the anticipation of serious consequences, and the feeling of a loss of control. All \nof these, he wrote, are necessary to produce fear, but each is not (in and of itself) sufficient. He \nthen suggested that these dimensions may combine to form complex interaction effects. Such a \ntreatment of vulnerability certainly has a greater scope than that developed by Perlof and Fetzer \n(1986). But is it too all-encompassing? Hale (1996: 95) thought so, arguing that the taxonomy \n\u2018\u2026risks stretching the concept so far as to be in danger of losing its focus and explanatory power.\u2019  \n                                                \n One way forward might be to advance a more focused definition of vulnerability \u2013 with \ngreater precision and explanatory purchase \u2013 that concentrates only on these three dimensions of \nthreat: public perceptions of likelihood, control and consequence. This is the approach taken in the \ncurrent study. The task is not to map out all those personal, social and situational aspects which \nare related to elevated perceptions of risk. Rather, the focus is only on those perceptions of risk, \nwith markers of vulnerability treated only as correlates of fear, to be investigated as springboards \nfor further explanation.  \n A number of studies have already addressed these perceptions, albeit not specifying them \naccording to a broad psychological definition of vulnerability. For example, Killias and Clerici \n(2000) found that the self-reported (but not interviewer-rated) ability to defend oneself was \nassociated with anticipated perceptions of personal safety in various situations. This implied that \n \n4 Perloff (1983) suggested that \u2018perceived unique invulnerability\u2019 might be negative, either leading us to \ntake fewer precautions than is prudent, or making us less able to cope with the impact of victimisation (it \nmight be more difficult to adjust to unexpected, unforeseen or unpredictable events, and the sudden loss of \nexaggerated control). Victimisation then might lead either to \u2018unique vulnerability\u2019 (seeing oneself as highly \nvulnerable and others as less vulnerability) or \u2018universal vulnerability\u2019 (seeing oneself and others as equally \nvulnerable). She also suggested that \u2018unique vulnerability\u2019 is associated with \u2018greater anxiety and \ndepression, lower self-esteem, and a more negative self-image [compared to] university vulnerability\u2019 (p. \n53). \n5 The findings suggested that when people compared themselves to vague targets, they tended to judge their \nrisk to be lower than average. But when people compared themselves to specific comparison targets, they \ntended to judge their risk to be similar. Given the opportunity, individuals often made comparisons with \nvague targets who were seen as especially vulnerable. \n 6\nthe fear of crime was related to \u2018\u2026the likely seriousness of the consequences, or to the inability of \nthe respondent to control risk or outcome, or both\u2019 (p. 448). And while this assertion went beyond \ntheir data (they did not actually measure public perceptions of consequence and control) it does \nseem plausible that self-reported physical capabilities are related to fear of crime because they are \nrelated to these dimensions of threat\/vulnerability (which are then related to fear of crime). \nInterestingly Killias and Clerici found that gender remained statistically significant (although age \ndid not) even after controlling for self-defence: some of the gender effect was explained, but not \nall. \n Other research has employed measures of perceived likelihood and consequence (e.g. \nWinkel et al., 2003; Denkers & Winkel, 1998a, 1998b; Winkel, 1998, 1989; Vrij & Winkel, \n1991). Winkel (1998) postulated that fear (measured in his study by asking individuals to imagine \n\u2018the possibility of becoming a crime victim\u2019 and report whether they felt calm or tense, safe or \nunsafe) emerges when risk is primed and\/or when the perceived likelihood\/consequence changes. \nWinkel found that fear was related to both perceived likelihood \u2013 measured by asking individuals \nthe chances of personal victimisation \u2013 and perceived consequence (measured by asking \nindividuals the seriousness of the consequences of personal victimisation). He also found that \nwhile victimisation experience was not associated with levels of fear, it was associated with higher \nperceived likelihood and lower perceived consequence (compared to controls). This led him to \nreason that the lack of effect of victimisation on fear was due to the higher perceived likelihood \nand the lower perceived consequence (changes caused by victimisation) cancelling each other \nout.6  \n Warr\u2019s (1987) model of \u2018sensitivity to risk\u2019 went beyond the main effects of likelihood \nand consequence on fear to investigate a more powerful framework. Analysing US data, he found \nthat when people judged crime to be especially serious, a lower level of perceived likelihood was \nneeded to stimulate some level of personal fear. Risk sensitivity refers to the idea that individuals \nare more \u2018sensitive\u2019 to a given level of perceived risk when they view the consequences of \nvictimisation to be especially serious. As such: \u2018 . . . circumstances or events that appear \ninnocuous or comparatively minor to males or younger persons are apt to be viewed as more \ndangerous to females and the elderly because of the offences they imply or portend\u2019 (Warr, 1994: \n19). For example, one person may associate burglary with the risk of physical or sexual assault; \nanother person may associate burglary with the loss of material goods and a great deal of \ninconvenience. Similarly, Ferraro (1995: 87) suggests that sexual harassment: \u2018 . . . shadow[s] \nother types of victimization among women. Rape may operate like any other master offence \namong women, especially younger women who have the highest rate of rape, heightening fear \nreactions for other forms of crime.\u2019 \nPerceived control might be one more element (alongside perceived likelihood and \nconsequence) of perceived vulnerability to crime. Jackson (2004) found that the frequency of \nworry about crime was related to feelings of control over the risk. Houts and Kassab (1997) \nshowed that some aspects of a \u2018locus-of-control\u2019 scale were related to perceptions of personal \nsafety. Denkers & Winkel (1998a) measured a broad construct named \u2018positive beliefs\u2019 that \ncovered a general locus of control scale, a measure of relative invulnerability (cf. Perlof, 1983) \nand a \u2018style of evaluation\u2019 that covers whether individuals felt generally positive over the past year \nin terms of finances, social life and health. While they did not disentangle these individual \nconstructs, they did find that high \u2018positive beliefs\u2019 was negatively associated with fear of crime \n(measured by asking individuals to imagine \u2018the possibility of becoming a crime victim\u2019 and \nreport whether they feel calm or tense, safe or unsafe\u2019). And in a qualitative study, Tulloch (2003: \n475) found that those interviewees who were fearful typically saw themselves at the \u2018mercy of \npowerful others (criminal gangs, predatory males, armed gunmen, paedophiles, etc.) and chance \n(through the random lottery-like nature of attacks).\u2019 In contrast the \u2018unfearful\u2019 individual felt \n                                                 \n6 Adding to the general confusion about the definition of vulnerability however, other studies by Winkel and \ncolleagues have defined vulnerability as perceptions of the likelihood of victimisation, while also at the \nsame time measuring \u2018negative impact\u2019 (or perceived consequence, see Denkers & Winkel, 1998b) and \n\u2018comparative vulnerability\u2019 via the comparison of one\u2019s own chances of victimisation compared to others \nchances (Winkel et al., 2003). \n 7\nprotected, claiming high levels of control over their environment, feeling that others were not \naggressively dominating public space.7  \n \nTHE STUDY \nTowards a psychological perspective on vulnerability  \nLooking across the literature therefore, all the pieces seem to be in place for a psychological \ndefinition of vulnerability. It is just that we lack the empirical assessment of an integrative \nperspective. People may feel especially vulnerable to the risk of crime because they see \nthemselves as especially likely to be targeted, and because they feel that the impact of crime for \nthem would be especially serious, and because they feel especially unable to control whether the \nevent occurs or not. Accordingly, this study (a) tests whether public perceptions of likelihood, \nconsequence and control (which are specified here to combine in a psychological definition of \nvulnerability) help explain gender and age differences in worry, and (b) assesses using structural \nequation modelling a meditational model that sequentially orders the variables and identifies the \nstrength of direct and indirect effects.8  \nTo be sure, there is some psychological work on the influence of social perception and \nenvironmental factors (van der Wurff, Van Staalduinen, & Stringer, 1989; Warr, 1990; Nasar & \nFisher, 1993; Perkins, Wandersman, Rich, & Taylor, 1993; Perkins & Taylor, 1996; Nasar & \nJones, 1997; Farrall, Bannister, Ditton., & Gilchrist, 2000; Jackson, 2004; Jackson et al., 2007). \nThere is some psychological work on the impact of criminal victimisation on fear (Winkel et al., \n2003; Denkers & Winkel, 1998a, 1998b; Winkel, 1998, 1989; Bilsky & Wetzels, 1997; Cates, \nDian, & Schnepf, 2003). There is some psychological work on what \u2018fear\u2019 of crime means in the \nfirst place, and what is actually being measured (Farrall, Bannister, Ditton, & Gilchrist, 1997; \nJackson et al., 2007; Gray, Jackson, & Farrall, 2008a, 2008b); and on social desirability and \nsuppression in the measurement of fear (Sutton & Farrall, 2005, 2008). And there is some \npsychological work on the impact of \u2018fear\u2019 on physical and psychological health (Chandola, 2001; \nWhitley & Prince, 2005; Stafford, Chandola, & Marmot, 2007; Kruger, Reischl, & Gee, 2007).  \nWhat we lack is an empirically assessed psychological perspective on vulnerability and risk \nperception. Gabriel and Greve (2003) differentiate between the fear of crime as a transitory state \u2013 \nwhich might be best measured by asking individuals about those moments when they find \nthemselves personally concerned about safety and security (Farrall & Gadd, 2004; Gray et al., \n                                                 \n7 This is redolent of work that suggests that an environment seen to be unpredictable, unfamiliar and beyond \nthe control of oneself or one\u2019s community may thus generate a sense of disquiet and an instinctive need to \nscan the environment for signs of trouble \u2013 a sense that \u2018\u2026anything could happen\u2019 (Warr, 1990; Carvahlo & \nLewis, 2003). \n8 One study has addressed public perceptions of likelihood, consequence and control in the fear of crime, \nbut it has done so in a rather unhelpful fashion. Cates et al. (2003: 228) defined fear of crime \u2018\u2026as a set of \nbeliefs or attitudes\u2019 and examined whether criminal victimisation was related to each of: (a) the severity of \nthreat (measured by asking individuals how much they agree or disagree with statements such as \u2018It is \ncommon these days to be tormented by others\u2019, \u2018Too many people today will steal if they see a way without \ngetting caught\u2019, and \u2018Today, kids tear up property with no thought at all\u2019); (b) the probability of occurrence \n(measured by asking individuals how much they agree or disagree with statements such as \u2018I am scared that \nsomeone may rob me\u2019, \u2018I sometimes fear for my life\u2019, and \u2018I worry that someone might \u201cstalk\u201d me\u2019); (c) the \nresponse efficacy (measured by asking individuals how much they agree or disagree with statements such as \n\u2018Women need to carry \u201cmace\u201d or pepper spray\u2019, \u2018The police in our area keep vandalism down\u2019, and \u2018The \ncourts are doing a good job of keeping the streets safe\u2019); and (d) the self-efficacy (measured by asking \nindividuals how much they agree or disagree with statements such as \u2018If I saw a robber leave a store, I \nwould try to get a good look at him for the police\u2019, \u2018I would rush to help someone who was being attacked\u2019, \n\u2018There is little that I can do to protect myself \u2013 it\u2019s really up to the police\u2019). First, these are somewhat \nidiosyncratic measures of these constructs (to put it mildly), mixing up many things in an unstructured and \nloose way. For example, might measuring the perceived probability of victimisation by asking individuals \nwhether they are scared that they might be robbed confuse cognitive assessments of likelihood with \nemotional appraisals of the same risk? Second, the analysis focuses only on the association between \ncriminal victimisation and each of these four \u2018beliefs or attitudes\u2019: Cates et al. (2003) did not address how \ndifferent aspects of risk perception inter-relate and coalesce to predict some emotional response. \n 8\n2008a) \u2013 and the fear of crime as a dispositional state. Dispositional fear is the \u2018tendency to \nexperience fear of crime in certain situations\u2019 (Gabriel & Greve, 2003: 601):9  \n \n\u2018Such an individual disposition is characterized by experiencing more situations as \nbeing relevant to fear, being more likely to experience fear in a given situation, and \npossibly experiencing fear more intensely. Therefore, persons with such a disposition \nare more likely to experience the state of \u201cbeing afraid\u201d \u2026 Dispositional fear of \ncrime is one of the parameters that regulate, influence or determine its actual \noccurrence, i.e. the situational fear of crime (as a state) \u2026 The dispositional fear of \ncrime is the result of a long-term (ontogenetic) developmental process that is \ninfluenced by personal conditions and attributes (such as anxiousness, perceptive \ntendencies and coping resources) on the one hand, and by individual experiences of \nfear-relevant situations on the other, as well as by the interaction of these two \nfactors.\u2019 (Gabriel & Greve, 2003: 601-602) \n \n  The current perspective states that one aspect of \u2018personal disposition\u2019 and \u2018dispositional \nfear\u2019 (Killias, 1990) is a relatively stable set of judgements about likelihood, control and \nconsequence of risk. One way of measuring dispositional states \u2013 the tendency to experience \nsituations as fearful \u2013 is to ask individuals about their general perceptions of the chances of \nvictimisation (\u2018am I\/my social group likely to be targeted by criminals as a victim?\u2019), their general \ncontrol over the event (\u2018am I able to deal with any potential trouble?\u2019) and their general perceived \nconsequences of the event (\u2018is victimisation going to have an especially big impact on me?\u2019). \nGabriel and Greve (2003: 60) mention the mediating roles of self-efficacy and individual coping \nresources that lie between state and dispositional fear of crime. Yet the more precise conception \npresented here refers to specific representations of the risk of victimisation (rather than less \nspecific and more wide-ranging self-efficacy and coping resources). Indeed Jackson (2006: 259) \nsuggests that:  \n \n\u2018\u2026people attach different weightings of consequences, likelihood, control, and \naffect to the potential of particular forms of criminal victimization. One individual \nmay imagine that being burgled would involve serious material, physical, and \npsychological effects; another may feel that the consequences would be \ncomparatively manageable. For the first individual the risk may be weighted by \nconsequence more than likelihood; for the second likelihood may be most \nimportant in his or her composition of perceived risk. What is important, therefore, \nis the vividness and composition of risk.\u2019 \n \nGabriel and Greve\u2019s (2003) dispositional state \u2013 the tendency of people to experience fear of crime \nin specific situations \u2013 is thus treated here as partly consisting of stable (vivid, evocative) \nrepresentations of risk which cover likelihood, control and consequence.10 Individuals might hold \nstructured and stable representations of risk which then operate as part of a disposition to \nexperience fear more intensely in certain situations. Individuals may generally feel unable to \ndefend themselves against physical attack for example. Or they may generally feel that such an \nattack would have disastrous personal consequences.  \n This is not to suggest that people\u2019s perceptions of risk do not vary from one situation to \nanother. Of course people feel that crime is especially likely and especially uncontrollable in \ncertain very specific circumstances. In this sense perceptions of risk are also fluid and situated \nfrom one situation to the next. Indeed perceptions of risk (and therefore according to the current \ndefinition, vulnerability) may include representations of the situational conditions (disorderly \nneighbourhoods which are seen to lack social cohesion and collective efficacy) under which crime \n                                                 \n9 It is interesting that Greve (2004: 170-171) argues that: \u2018If fear of crime is not experienced frequently or \neasily, it cannot be regarded as dispositional fear \u2026 [since] a dispositional fear of crime should be apparent \nin at least the frequency of fear episodes.\u2019 (emphasis in original) \n10  See Jackson (2008) for thoughts on other issues, including vividness\/availability and morality\/outrage. \n 9\nis likely, uncontrollable, and serious (Ferraro, 1995; Jackson, 2004, 2006, 2008). But it is assumed \nhere that people also have more stable representations of their susceptibility to crime. \nHow to link vulnerability\/perceived risk to emotion? In a model from clinical psychology \nthat explicates worry and the worry process, Tallis and Eysenck (1994) used Lazarus\u2019 (1966; see \nalso Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) theoretical framework to distinguish between threat significance \n(\u2018personal cost\u2019, \u2018imminence\u2019 and \u2018likelihood\u2019 of an anticipated event \u2013 the primary appraisal) and \ncoping resources (secondary appraisal). When estimated threat exceeds estimated coping \nresources, an individual might feel threatened and worry will be triggered. With worry about \ncrime, \u2018imminence\u2019 (when the event might occur) and \u2018likelihood\u2019 (how likely it is that the event \nwill occur in the first place) might be collapsed into the perceived likelihood of victimization \noccurring in the next year. Worry would then be stimulated by the appraisal of threat: the \nseriousness of the consequences of victimization (the event and one\u2019s ability to cope with the \nconsequences), the likelihood of the event occurring, and the ability to control its occurrence in the \nfirst place. The model is further simplified by expecting each to have direct effects on worry \n(although in the final stage of modelling, control and consequence are also expected to have direct \neffects on likelihood). Finally, throughout the study worry is treated as the transitory state. \nEmotions are short-lived bodily events, located in space and time. Accordingly, individuals were \nasked in this study how often they have worried about falling victim of a number of crimes over \nthe past month (see Greve, 1998; Farrall & Gadd, 2004; Gray et al., 2008a).  \nThe overall approach taken in this study echoes Wikstrom and Sampson\u2019s (2006: 2) \ndiscussion of research into crime: \u2018According to a mechanism-based approach most correlates (or \n\u201crisk factors\u201d) of crime are in fact spurious associations that denote markers rather than represent \nmechanisms that actually cause a particular social action.\u2019 The social, personal and situational \ncharacteristics that Killias (1990) would call vulnerability \u2013 because they are associated with fear \nof crime \u2013 are treated in this study as only markers that demand further investigation. Correlates \nare evaluated for their potential as representing causal mechanisms. Here gender (and age) is \nassessed as a correlate of fear. One then uses gender as a springboard to address the psychological \nmechanisms underpinning gender differences. Namely, females might worry more frequently \nabout falling victim (transitory states) compared to males because they see the event as more \nlikely, more consequential, and less able to control (dispositional states). It is these intervening \npsychological processes that the study investigates.  \n \nMETHOD \nParticipants \nA pure random probability sample of 1,800 residents from two contrasting neighbouring areas of \nLondon was drawn from the United Kingdom Electoral Register, which covers adults registered to \nvote in General Elections. The first area \u2013 given the pseudonym Victoria Gardens \u2013 was a wealthy \npart of London with relatively low levels of crime. The second area \u2013 given the pseudonym \nCatherine House \u2013 was a deprived part of the same Borough with high crime rates and a local \nreputation for drugs and anti-social behaviour. In the two areas in question, the Electoral Register \nidentified approximately 6,000 registered voters. \nA questionnaire \u2013 including a covering letter and explaining the request to participate and \nassuring anonymity \u2013 was mailed with a self-addressed, postage-paid envelope. Financial \nconstraints meant that Dillman\u2019s (1999) guidelines for achieving a successful postal survey could \nnot be followed (here, \u2018successful\u2019 is defined as having a response rate of 60% to 70% and above). \nOnly two personalised contacts were made. If no questionnaire was returned within 2 weeks, a \nreminder letter and duplicate questionnaire was sent out. In an attempt to increase the response \nrate, a \u2018raffle\u2019 was carried out (three prizes of \u00a350, \u00a325 and \u00a310). The overall response rate was \n26.6% (479 completed and returned questionnaires) with 33.2% in the first area (299 in Victoria \nGardens) and 20.0% in the second (180 in Katherine House). \n \nMeasures \nThe principal topics of the survey were: (a) worry about crime, (b) perceptions of personal risk of \ncrime, (c) relative risk judgements and (d) respondent assessments of their ability to defend \nthemselves from physical attack. In order to measure worry about crime and perceived personal \n 10\nrisk, respondents were asked four different question sets, with each set relating to one of the \nfollowing seven types of crime: \n \n\u2022 being attacked by a stranger in the street;  \n\u2022 being robbed or mugged in the street;  \n\u2022 being harassed, threatened or verbally abused in the street;  \n\u2022 being pick-pocketed or having something stolen in a non-violent manner; \n\u2022 having the home or property vandalised or defaced; \n\u2022 having someone break into the home whilst the inhabitants were there; and  \n\u2022 having someone break into the home whilst the inhabitants were away.11  \n \nOn worry about crime, respondents were how often (if at all) they had worried about \nbecoming a victim of each of the seven crimes while in their own neighbourhood.12 The response \nalternatives were: \u2018not once in the last month\u2019; \u2018once or twice in the past month\u2019; \u2018once or twice in \nthe past week\u2019; and \u2018every day\u2019. This is a short time period. However, a number of studies on the \nresponse process with behavioural survey questions indicate that using a short and focused time \nperiod increases the tendency to enumerate, which may improve the accuracy of responses (e.g. \nO'Muircheartaigh, Gaskell, & Wright, 1993). Furthermore, they were very close to those which \nO'Muircheartaigh et al. (1993) identified as typical in a wide range of national surveys; and are \nconsistent with the work of Jackson (2004, 2005) and Jackson and Sunshine (2007). The objective \nis to get reliable estimates of frequency for each respondent and then model the various across the \nsample. \nRisk perception was treated as three separate assessments of the absolute likelihood of \nvictimisation, personal control over its event, and anticipated consequences: \n \n\u2022 Respondents were asked how likely they thought it was that they would fall victim of each \nof the seven crimes during the next twelve months. A seven-point scale was used with \nonly the endpoints labelled: 1 = definitely not going to happen and 7 = certain to happen.  \n\u2022 Respondents were asked the extent to which they felt able to control whether or not they \nbecame a victim of various crimes. A seven-point scale was used with only the endpoints \nlabelled: 1 = not at all;  and 7 = to a very great extent.   \n\u2022 Respondents were asked the extent to which an experience of a typical instance of each \ncategory of criminal victimisation would affect their lives. The questions used seven-point \nresponse alternatives which were labelled at the endpoints: 1 = not at all; and 7 = to a very \ngreat extent.  \n \nThe study also addressed judgements of relative risk, measured by asking respondents the \nfollowing question: \n \n\u2018Please could you now think about the sorts of people who are more or less likely \nthan average to become victims of crime in the [current area]. To the best of your \nability, please indicate whether you think the following groups are more or less likely \nto experience crime than the other groups in this area. For example, the first question \n                                                 \n11 These crime categories were expected to cluster within two domains: personal crime in public space and \nburglary. These form two distinct (but correlating) latent constructs interpreted as worry (to take worry as an \nexample) about crime in public space and worry about property crime. This follows the idea that individuals \ndo not distinguish between offence categories when they are appraising the danger of a particular type of \nvictimisation, but rather have a more general sense of possibility. \n12 Asking about the past frequency of worry may be the most precise way of measuring the everyday \nexperience of the fear of crime (Farrall & Gadd, 2004; Gray et al, in press). By contrast to standard \nmeasures \u2013 which typically ask individuals how safe they feel walking alone in their area after dark, or how \nworried they are overall about falling victim of different crimes \u2013 these indicators focus on actual events of \nemotion. They are also more highly correlated (compared to standard measures) with the self-reported \nimpact of crime on people\u2019s own quality of life (Jackson et al., 2007). \n 11\nasks whether females aged between 18 and 30 more or less likely to become a victim \nof crime than the other groups (females of other ages and males of all ages overall)?\u2019 \n \nThe groups were: males aged between 18 and 30; males aged between 31 and 64; males aged 65 \nand upwards; females aged between 18 and 30; females aged between 31 and 64; and females \naged 65 and upwards. The respondents alternatives were: \u2018much less likely than the other groups\u2019; \n\u2018a little less likely than the other groups\u2019; \u2018about the same chance as the other groups\u2019; \u2018a little \nmore likely than the other groups\u2019; \u2018much more likely than the other groups\u2019. A new variable was \nderived which captured the comparison involving respondents\u2019 own gender and age group. For \nexample, if the respondent fell in the \u2018male aged between 18 and 30\u2019 category, the new variable \nwas their response to the comparison of \u2018males aged between 18 and 30\u2019 to the other groups.  \n Finally, the survey asked respondents the following question: \u2018How well do you think you \ncould physically defend yourself or ward off an attack from a man?\u2019 The response alternatives \nwere: \u2018Very well\u2019, Pretty well\u2019, \u2018Not very well\u2019 and \u2018Not at all well\u2019. \n \nProcedure \nIndividual indicators of worry about crime and the three components of personal risk perception \n(likelihood, control and consequence) were combined into two sets of indices for each construct, \none set involving all crimes (so one index of worry about all crimes, one index of perceived \nlikelihood of all crimes, one index of perceived control over all crimes, and one index of perceived \nconsequence of all crimes) and the other involving personal crime (4 indices) and property crime \n(4 indices) separately. Factor scores for each measure were derived from exploratory factor \nanalysis where only the appropriate crime types were included (Jackson, 2005). Hierarchical linear \nregression was then used to examine whether personal risk perception and the relative risk \njudgement explained or attenuated any gender effects on worry about crime. Finally, structural \nequation modelling was used to test a mediational model of the psychology of risk in the fear of \ncrime, first for the full sample, then for a set of sub-groups defined according to type of crime, \ngender and age. \n \nRESULTS \nExamining gender effects in the fear of crime \nTable 1 shows the results from seven models that comprise a set of hierarchical linear regressions. \nThe first specified only one explanatory variable: gender. The statistically significant regression \ncoefficient indicates that females had, on average, a higher overall score than males on index of \nworry about all type of crimes. Models 2 to 6 then included one at time: (a) physical ability to \ndefend oneself, (b) relative risk judgement, (c) perceived consequences, (d) perceived control, and \n(e) perceived likelihood. Each was a statistically significant predictor of worry about crime, and in \nthe cases of physical defence and the relative risk judgement, the gender effect lost its statistical \nsignificance. First, females on average felt less able to defend themselves from attack, and this \nexplained why they typically worry more frequently than males. Second, females on average \nbelieved that women in general (and in particular, women of their own age group) were more at \nrisk of crime than males, and this also explained their more frequent worry. For consequence, \ncontrol and personal likelihood, the effect of gender remained statistically significant, but was \nsignificantly reduced when compared to Model 1.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nFinally, Model 7 included all the explanatory variables in one model. Here we found that \nonly the relative risk judgement, feelings of control and judgements of personal likelihood were \nstatistically significant predictors of worry about crime. Because physical defence and \nconsequence was each an important predictor when included in the restricted models (model 2 and \n4 respectively), this suggested that some kind of mediational model should be examined: perhaps \nphysical defence and consequence fed into judgements of likelihood and control? We return to this \nissue later in the paper. \n 12\nGiven the qualitative difference between crimes of a \u2018personal\u2019 nature \u2013 such as physical \nattack in the street by a stranger, or mugging\/robbery \u2013 and crimes of a \u2018property\u2019 nature \u2013 such as \nburglary or vandalism \u2013 it was important to repeat these analyses for these two cases. Table 2 \nshows the results for personal and property crime. The most striking finding was that gender was a \nstatistically significant predictor of worry about personal crime (Model 1, personal crime) but was \nnot for worry about property crime (Model 1, property crime). The second important finding was \nthat the coefficients when the response variable was worry about personal crime were similar to \nthe findings when the response variable was worry about all crime (Table 1). Finally, apart from \nno gender effect, judgement of consequence was (for property crime) an important predictor of \nworry but judgement of control was not (Model 2, property crime). \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nExamining age effects in the fear of crime  \nSo far we have seen that females worried more frequently than males about personal crime, but \ndid not worry any more or less frequently about property crime. Moreover, each individual aspect \nof vulnerability and risk perception either attenuated the effect of gender or rendered it not \nstatistically significant. Thus compared to males, females felt less able to physical defend \nthemselves, felt that their own gender (and age group) are more likely to fall victim, judged the \nconsequences to be more serious, felt less able to control the risk, and felt it is more likely \u2013 and \neach of these went some way to explaining why females worried more about personal crime than \nmales did. \nBut what about age? For brevity, the results of the statistical analyses are not presented \nhere.13 In summary however, the bivariate analysis found a statistically significant negative effect \nof age on worry about crime (combining personal and property crime): the older respondents were, \nthe less frequently they worried. Each individual aspect of vulnerability and risk perception was a \nsignificant predictor of worry about crime (now controlling for the effect of age), however the age \neffect did not decrease (if anything, it increased for physical defence and feelings of control). \nLooking individually at personal and property crime, age was only a significant predictor of worry \nabout personal crime, and again the individual aspects of vulnerability and risk perception did not \nreduce the effect of age for worry about personal crime. For personal crime, control, likelihood \nand relative risk judgements were significant factors; for property crime, perceived consequences \nwere also important. \n \nTesting a meditational model of risk perception and vulnerability \nThe analysis thus presented hints strongly at the presence of a number of mediational \nrelationships. Most strikingly, the impact of gender on worry about personal crime was entirely \nmediated by the judgements of vulnerability and risk perception. But tellingly, physical defence \nand perceived consequences were statistically significant predictors of worry about personal crime \nin restricted models, but were no longer significant in the full models.  \n Consequently, the next step was to test a mediational model. For space reasons, only the \nfinal analyses are presented here. Initial analysis had age and gender on the left-hand side of the \nmodel, worry on the right-hand side of the model, and mediating risk perception variables in the \nmiddle. Findings confirmed that the effect of gender on worry was entirely mediated by these \nintervening variables. This was not the case with age. Then, moving to focus on vulnerability and \nworry, a model was tested on the full sample (Figure 1). However because multi-group analyses \nrevealed different strengths of associations according to different gender and age groups, the \nanalyses were tested, first for males and females separately, and second for three age groups \nseparately: younger, middle-aged, and older people. For space reasons, the focus is on personal \nnot on property crime. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n  \n                                                 \n13 Please contact the author for the full statistical results. \n 13\n Figure 1 first showed general support for a mediational model that specified that physical \ndefence predicted control and consequence; control, consequence and the relative risk judgement \npredicted likelihood, and all predicted worry about crime (all paths not statistically significant \nwere removed from the model). The key difference between males and females was that control \nand relative risk judgements predicted worry about personal crime for females, but they did not for \nmales. Similar analyses for age showed three differences (not reported here). First, the relative risk \njudgement was an important predictor of perceived likelihood and worry about personal crime for \nmiddle-aged and older people, but not for younger people. Consequently, judging their own age \n(and gender) group to be more likely to fall victim was a significant factor for the middle-aged and \nolder, but not for the younger (who have a greater risk of victimisation). Second, physical defence \nwas not a factor in explaining perceived likelihood for older people, but it was for the rest. Third, \nperceived control was not predictive of worry for older people, but it was for the other two age \ngroups. \n \nDISCUSSION \nThis paper began by arguing that despite some promising conceptual advances \u2013 and despite a \nnumber of studies that have addressed perceived risk and the fear of crime \u2013 few studies have \naddressed the psychological processes that underpin vulnerability and perceived susceptibility to \ncrime. This is not to say that there are no psychological models in the literature. Far from it. The \nproblem is that we lack a convincing psychological perspective on risk perception and \nvulnerability. To be sure, some studies have addressed likelihood and consequence appraisals \n(Winkel et al., 2003; Denkers & Winkel, 1998a, 1998b; Winkel, 1998, 1999; Vrij & Winkel, \n1991) and perceived control over victimisation (Jackson, 2004, 2005). Yet no study has specified \nwhether all three risk perceptions \u2013 alongside the judgement of relative risk and the self-rated \nability to defend oneself from physical attack \u2013 operate as the psychological mechanisms that \nunderpin vulnerability.  \nIn order to integrate a rather disparate research literature, this study examined whether \ngender and age differences were explained by different perceptions of risk. Age and gender have \noften been used as proxies for vulnerability within the fear of crime literature. Here they were used \nonly as a springboard to develop a psychological account of vulnerability: are correlates of fear \n(e.g. gender) associated with higher levels of fear because of mediating and differential \nassessments of risk and susceptibility to crime (i.e. increased self-perceived vulnerability)? \nSupport was found for this idea with respect to gender but not with respect to age. The \nstudy found that females worried more frequently than males about personal crime (but not about \nproperty crime) and that this could be explained either fully or partly by differential risk \nperception. Females felt less in control than males and judged the consequences to be higher; they \njudged likelihood to be higher and felt that their own social group was more likely to fall victim \nthan other social groups. This study also found that younger people worried more frequently than \nolder people about personal crime (but not about property crime) \u2013 a finding consistent with the \nstudies of Akers, La Greca, Sellers, and Cochran (1987), Chadee and Ditton (2003), Ferraro and \nLaGrange (1992), LaGrange and Ferraro (1989) and Ziegler and Mitchell (2003) \u2013 but contrary to \ngender, these differences could not be explained by differential vulnerability or likelihood-\nperception. And further investigation \u2013 which differentiated between personal and property crime \n\u2013 showed that females worried more frequently than males about personal crime, but that there \nwas no gender difference in worry about property crime. The same was true for age: younger \npeople worried more than older people about personal crime, but there was no age effect with \nproperty crime.  \nSince the findings suggested a series of mediational relationships, structural equation \nmodelling was then carried out to test a number of models. Support was found for the idea that (a) \nphysical defence predicts control and consequence; (b) control and consequence both predict \nlikelihood; (c) relative risk judgements also predict absolute risk judgements; and (d) relative risk \njudgements and likelihood both predict worry about crime. Notably, perceived control was more \nimportant to females and to young people compared to males and to older people. Indeed, relative \nrisk judgements were more important to females and to older people compared to males and to \nyounger people. Strikingly, for males the effect of control, consequence, and relative risk on worry \n 14\nwas entirely mediated by likelihood for males. But for females control and relative risk had direct \neffects on worry. \n Before we proceed to the implications of the study, a quick note on work by Sutton & \ncolleagues (Sutton & Farrall, 2005, 2008; Sutton et al., 2008) that has suggested that gender \ndifferences in fear are less to do with actual differences in fear and more to do with men being less \nwilling to report fear than women. The gender differences found in the current study could indeed \nbe due to self-presentation biases and social desirability, not to actual differences in worry. Males \nmay have worried just as frequently as females, it is just that they were less likely to admit it. If \nthis was the case however, all the other responses to vulnerability\/perceived risk question would \nalso have to be explained by systematic differences in self-presentation. Thus even with the same \nlevel of fear experienced on a day-to-day basis, females would be more likely than males to say \nthey had worried more often, more likely to report that the consequences were more severe, more \nlikely to report that they had less control, and more likely to report that it was more likely (for \nthem and for their social group as a whole). In short they would have presented themselves not \njust as more worried but also as more vulnerable.14 This is certainly possible: men may feel just as \nvulnerable as women \u2013 and worry just as frequently as women \u2013 but just be less willing to admit \nto others their worries and sense of vulnerability. Future work might investigate this broader \nconception of \u2018deceptive responding\u2019 and the problems of self-presentation in fear of crime \nresearch. \n \nCONCLUSION \nOverall \u2013 and looking across a substantial and interdisciplinary literature \u2013 research into the fear of \ncrime has paid scant attention to the psychological processes which underpin risk perception and \nvulnerability. To be sure, theoretical advances have been made. But in the main, studies have \noperationalised \u2018vulnerability\u2019 through simplistic means. Circular arguments explain that women \n(or the elderly, or the poor) are worried about crime because they are vulnerable (i.e. they worry \nmore). Yet despite Killias\u2019s (1990) careful conceptual work \u2013 and despite studies which have \nvariously addressed perceived likelihood, perceived consequence and locus of control, most often \nnot treating these judgements as part of vulnerability (Warr, 1984, 1986, 1987; Vrij & Winkel, \n1991; Denkers & Winkel, 1998a, 1998b; Winkel et al., 2003; Winkel, 1998) \u2013 no study has tested \na complete definition of perceived susceptibility that draws upon a complete set of risk perception \njudgements to explain gender and age effects.  \nFuture work might extend the current strategy to explore the full range of physical, social \nand situational factors that make up Killias\u2019s (1990) schema. A good example might be health. \nStafford et al. (2007) have showed that fear of crime affects physical and mental health. But it is \nplausible that health also affects fear of crime: those of poor physical and mental health might feel \nmore vulnerable and thus worry more. They might feel likely to be targeted by criminals; they \nmight feel unable to control the event; and they might feel that victimisation would have \nespecially serious consequences. Future work into vulnerability might also address the distinct \ndispositional and transitory\/dispositional aspects of the fear of crime. For example, how do the \ndispositional perceptions of risk (the general perceptions of likelihood, control and consequence \nthat were addressed in this study) interact with situational risk appraisals (the perceptions that \nrelate to a specific situation to produce momentary worries about falling victim)? \nThis paper found that individuals worry about crime because they appraise a threat. Threat \nassessment involves judgements about the likelihood, control and consequence of risk. When \nindividuals judge the impact of crime to be especially high, and when individuals feel that they \n                                                 \n14 It may be that the frequency measure of worry used in this study is less susceptible to these self-\npresentation biases than the standard measures investigated by Sutton and colleagues (\u2018How worried are you \n\u2026?\u2019). In Robinson & Clore\u2019s (2002a, 2002b) presentation of a range of problems in emotional self-report, \nthey suggest that some people report identity-related beliefs when answering questions about their everyday \nemotions. Applying this to standard measures of fear of crime (\u2018How worried are you \u2026?\u2019), men may be \nmore reluctant because it is may not be part of their male identity to admit vulnerability. However, \nfrequency measures on the other hand, may be less likely to tap into identity-related beliefs, because they \ndirect respondent attention onto actual experiential knowledge (i.e. actual episodes of worry). \n 15\nhave especially low levels of control over its incidence, then levels of worry will tend to be \nrelatively high. By contrast, judgements of relative risk (how likely is it that people from my own \nsocial group will fall victim compared to other social groups?) and absolute risk (how likely is it \nthat I will become victim?) are even more important in shaping subsequent worries about crime.  \nThese findings have implications for debates about the rationality of the fear of crime. \nMuch of the academic, social and political interest in the fear of crime has centred upon the \nrelationship between crime and fear (and the negative impact of fear on individuals and \ncommunities). On the one hand, some argue that fears are grounded in the reality of crime, \nmeaning we should not diminish the different ways in which crime damages on society. On the \nother hand, some suggest that fears are stoked up by the mass media and utilised by cynical \npoliticians to push hard-line but populist criminal justice system policies. This study complicates \nany easy comparison between \u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018crime.\u2019 As Sparks (1992: 123) suggests, to describe fear \nas rational because it is \u2018wholly accounted for an antecedent level of objective risk\u2019 begs the \nquestion: what are the criteria for proportionality? To decide the basis of when a fear is \u2018wholly \naccounted for\u2019 involves moral and political choices. This study suggests that some of these moral \nand political choices centre upon public perceptions of control and consequence. Can we in all \nconscience describe someone as irrational (and try to educate them about the reality of crime) \nwhen their fear is higher than the actual probability of victimisation but when they also judge the \nconsequences of victimisation to be especially high and feel especially unable to control the \nevent? While perceptions of likelihood can be wrong, it is surely more difficult to argue that \nsomeone\u2019s sense of control and consequence is somehow out of kilter and in need of correction \nand education.  \nThat being said, the present study did show that public perceptions of the absolute and \nrelative risk crime were the most important predictors of fear of crime. Indeed the effect of \nperceived control and consequence on worry was often mediated by perceived likelihood (absolute \nrisk and relative risk). Moreover females often felt that their people of their own gender and age \ngroup were more likely to be victimised than other gender and age groups (and this helped \nexplained their more frequent worries). Perhaps we should retain some sense of proportionality. \nComparisons between public perception of the actual extent of crime might still be useful, even if \nthe water is muddied somewhat by the roles of perceived control and consequence.  \nOverall, looking across the literature and reviewing the debates surrounding fear of crime \nover the past few decades, crude labels of \u2018irrational\u2019 and \u2018rational\u2019 have seemed to draw attention \naway from a more careful and nuanced investigation of the psychological mechanisms \nunderpinning fear of crime. The idea that risk should be judged only through cold assessments of \nprobability seems na\u00efve and unrealistic; empirical enquiry into public perceptions of the risk of \ncrime has been unnecessarily narrow. This study has looked at one aspect of lay representations of \nrisk \u2013 a psychological sense of vulnerability in the form of not just likelihood but also control and \nconsequence \u2013 and offered one explanation for the weak link between crime and fear.  \n \n\u2018If we are afraid of a thing we must first have an image or representation of it \u2026 Why \nthen should it not be the case that the fears which preoccupy us most would not be \nthose which are most likely to come to pass? Rather they are likely to be the most \nrepresentationally powerful fears \u2013 fears which attach to our sense of identity, \nsecurity and potency in the world and which therefore affect us as whole social beings \nand not as the risk-accounting ciphers of crude rational choice theories\u2019 (Sparks, \n1992: 133). \n \nPeople may develop a representation of risk that includes their sense of control over the world and \nthe resonance of the consequences of victimization, distilling what they value and what they \nwould hate to lose. Some feel they would lose much of value (and have little control over the \npotential loss) and that the risk of crime is especially vivid, especially evocative and especially \nsignificant. It is here \u2013 on the topic of vulnerability and the psychology of risk \u2013 that psychologists \nmight most contribute, to help to unravel the dynamics of this important social and political issue \nof the day. \n 16\nReferences \n \nAkers, R.L., La Greca, A.J., Sellers, C. & Cochran, J.
