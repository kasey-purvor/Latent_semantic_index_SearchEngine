JIT is a technique for \nreducing wastage through procedures that establish \ngood communications throughout the production \nprocess to ensure that all resources are used optimally. \nIn other words, \u2018let only the system that needs parts get \nthem, and only in the quantity needed\u2019 \u2013 i.e. lean \nmanagement. The process includes mistake proofing \nfor operators \u2013i.e. zero quality control, ZQC (=poka \nyoke) - that inhibits defects occurring by monitoring \nprocess-conditions at source and correcting \ndivergences that could cause defects. Poka yoke \nconcepts result in better quality products and greater \nparticipation by workers in efforts to improve \nprocesses, products and the company as a whole. \n \nPoka yoke A simple method for trying to prevent defects from \noccurring, initially introduced for business processes. \n \nSingle Minute Exchange of Die, \n(SMED) \nThis describes the Shingeo Shingo [2] technique of \ndividing the set-up and change-over procedures into \nexternal and internal elements and concentrating on \nreducing the internal time taken so that less of the \nequipment\u2019s available time is consumed during a \nchange-over. The \u2018single\u2019 here means single-digit \nnumber of minutes \u2013 i.e. less than ten! SMED or quick \nchangeover techniques have been used in JIT \nmanufacturing processes. Cycle-time reduction \nresulted in products and services that are better, \ncheaper and delivered faster, hence reducing the need \nfor large inventories.  \n \nSpeed In the present context, speed means the rate at which a \nproduct is manufactured. \n \nStatistical Process Control (SPC) This technique, popularised by Deming [3], is used to \nisolate (in a process) the controllable aspects from \nrandom variations, by means of statistical analysis. \nWith correct information, the staff can establish \ncontrol within acceptable ranges through manual or \nautomatic monitoring: adjustment data were gathered \nfor each part of the process. The staff learn to analyse \nwhat the controls output, which leads to them making \ncreative suggestions for achieving improvements in the \ndesign \n 3 \nTeam Problem-Solving, (TPS) This technique, popularised by Juram et al [4], uses \nteam actions to benefit from the opportunities \noccurring during a project. This helps reluctant \nparticipants to accept improvements, because it \ninvolves them in making and accepting \nrecommendations on problems, they know need \nresolving. \nTotal productive  \nMaintenance (TPM) \nThis recently-introduced maintenance strategy for \nplant and equipment usually involves a change in the \nmind-set of personnel towards their job \nresponsibilities. It requires commitment to the \nprogramme by members of the upper level \nmanagement team as well as empowering employees \nto initiate corrective actions for defaulting aspects of \nthe system or process under their jurisdiction \n[http:\/\/www.marshallinstitute.com]. \n \nTHE PROBLEM \n \nMaintenance is undertaken to preserve the proper functioning of a physical system, so \nthat it will continue to do what it was designed to do. Its function and performance \ncharacteristics not only take account of output, unit costs and effectiveness of using \nenergy, but also such factors as end-product quality, process control, achieved \ncomfort and protection of the employed personnel, compliance with environmental-\nprotection regulations, structural integrity and even the physical appearance of the \nproductive system.  \n \nThe quality of maintenance significantly affects business profitability. The factors \ninvolved include safety, and customer service, not just plant costs and availability. \nIncreased downtime affects adversely the capability of physical systems by reducing \ntheir average rate (i.e. speed) of output, so increasing the operating costs and lowering \nthe average customer\u2019 s satisfaction with the service [5]. With system availability \nbecoming critical, issues such as reducing operating costs as well as the strategic \nimportance of employing better and, if feasible, optimal maintenance schedules need \nto be more universally recognised and implemented. \n \nToday\u2019 s world is one of growing expectations, increasingly onerous regulatory \nconstraints, shifting technological paradigms and apparently endless and urgent \nreorganisations. Just as each major corporation has evolved a mission statement to \nhelp maintain a unified approach despite varying distractions, it is also desirable to \ndevelop a mission philosophy and statement to help maintenance staff do likewise. \nMaintenance serves three distinct sets-the owners, the users of the system, and society \nas a whole. Owners are usually satisfied if their system generates an adequate and \ncontinuing financial return on their capital investment.  Users want each asset to \ncontinue to do whatever it was designed to do, to a standard of performance, which \nthey consider at least to be satisfactory. Society expect the assets, in which \ninvestments have been made, not to fail in ways that lead to threats to public health \nand safety as well as environment. \n \n 4 \nThe technology of maintenance is about finding and applying cost-effective ways of \navoiding or overcoming performance deterioration. Failure-management techniques \ninclude predictive and preventive actions, failure-finding, run-to-failure and changes \nto the design of the physical asset or the way it is operated. Each category includes a \nhost of options, some of which are far more effective than others. Maintenance staffs \nnot only need to be aware of what these options are, but they also have to decide \nwhich are appropriate to their circumstances. Making a wise choice should improve \nthe asset\u2019 s performance, as well as reduce overall costs. However, making a wrong \nchoice could create new problems while existing ones may worsen. Therefore, the \nrelevant mission statement should emphasise the need to make the most cost-effective \ndecisions from a comprehensive array of pertinent options. \n \nFailures usually attract attention because they can adversely affect output, safety, \nenvironmental health, quality of end product, customer service, competitiveness and \nunit costs. The severity and frequency with which a failure leads to these \nconsequences dictate which failure-management technique is worth applying. \nTherefore, the mission statement should acknowledge the key role of \u2018consequence \navoidance\u2019  in maintenance.  The policy should be effective in the use of resources (i.e. \npeople, materials, spares, tools, etc). Hence, the cost of maintenance depends not only \non the maintenance staff, but also on the designers and operators of the considered \nmanufacturing system. In the present high-stress, turbulent business-environment, \nwell-run organisations strive continually to enhance their capabilities to create \nexcellent value for the customers by improving the cost effectiveness of the \noperations. Maintenance is thus a vital support function in business, especially as \nincreasingly large investments are being required in physical assets [6]. \n \nTotal productive-maintenance (TPM) is a proven and successful procedure for \nintroducing maintenance considerations into organisational activities. It involves \noperational and maintenance staff working together as a team to reduce wastage, \nminimise downtime and improve end-product quality. It needs active well-focussed \nmaintenance staff, even when the system is perceived to be working as expected. \nTPM builds on the concepts of just-in-time (JIT), lean management, total quality-\nmanagement (TQM) and design to achieve minimum life-cycle cost (LCC): it has \nspread from manufacturing to the process (such as petro-chemical) industries, and \npossesses the potential to be used in people management as well as generally for \nimproved resource-use. \n \nMany industries in Nigeria operate productively for less that than 50 percent of even \nthe nominally-functioning hours per year. Part of this embarrassment is caused by \nhigh downtime, supply failures for input resources, and low spare-capacity to cope \nwith sudden high demands.  \n \nTPM focuses on optimising planning and scheduling. Availability, performance and \nyield (i.e. acceptable quality-rate) are other factors that affect productivity [7]. \nAvailability losses result from breakdowns and change-overs, i.e., the situation in \nwhich the line is not running when it should be. Performance losses arise from speed \nlosses and small stops or idling or empty positions. In this case, the line may be \nrunning, but it is not producing the quantity it should. Yield losses consist of losses \ndue to rejects and poor start-up behaviour in the line producing the products. These \nlosses lead to low values of the overall equipment\u2019 s effectiveness (OEE), which \n 5 \nprovides an indication of how effective the production process is. TPM helps to raise \nthe value of the OEE by supplying a structure to facilitate the assessment of those \nlosses, and subsequently giving priority to dealing with the more serious offenders. \nApplication of TPM leads to both short- and long-term improvements. \n \nTPM entails having a: \n\u2022 Leaner organisational structure (i.e. fewer managers as well as delegating \npower and responsibility to individual members of the team). \n\u2022 Multi-skilled workforce \n\u2022 Rigorous reappraisal of the way things are done now and so improvements are \nintroduced\u2013often resulting in simplification, standardisation and\/or \nharmonization.  \n \nTPM seeks to encourage the setting of ambitious, but attainable, goals for raising the \nvalue of the OEE and to measure any deviations in what is achieved relative to the \noriginal objective. \n \nLITERATURE REVIEW \n \nThe concept of TPM originated in Japan\u2019 s manufacturing industries, initially with the \naim of eliminating production losses due to limitations in the JIT process for \nproduction operations [8]. Seichi Nakajima is credited with defining the fundamental \nconcepts of TPM and seeing the procedure implemented in hundreds of plants in \nJapan; the key concept being autonomous maintenance [9]. \n \nTPM is a major departure from the \u201cyou operate, I maintain\u201d philosophy [10]. It is the \nimplementation of productive maintenance by all associated personnel (whether \nmachine operators or members of the management team), based on the involvement of \nall in the continual improvement of performance. TPM endeavours to eliminate the \nroot causes of problems, through team-based decisions and their implementation. \nAchieving low-cost improvements and zero-deficit product quality are striven for, \nwhile designing for minimum LCC maintenance and using the JIT procedure. All \nemployees through small-group activities, which include aiming for zero breakdowns \nand zero defects, should implement it. The three components of the concept are: (i) \noptimised equipment-effectiveness, (ii) autonomous-operator maintenance and (iii) \ncompany-led small-group activities, throughout the entire organisation. This is a \n\u201chigh-employee involvement\u201d approach. It leads to improved creative group-efforts, \ngreater individual effort, personal responsibility, and lively innovative problem-\nsolving meetings. TPM concepts involve commitments to long-range planning, \nespecially on the part of senior management. Typically, TPM is initiated as a \u201ctop-\ndown\u201d exercise, but only implemented successfully via \u201cbottom-up\u201d participation. \nHowever, consensus building may take about three years, from the planning phase, for \nsustainability to be achieved in a large organisation. \n \nTPM is a manufacturing-led initiative that emphasises the importance of (i) people \nwith a \u2018can do\u2019  and continual improvement attitude and (ii) production and \nmaintenance personnel working together in unison. In essence, TPM seeks to integrate \nthe organisation to recognise, liberate and utilise its own potential and skills [11]. \n \n 6 \nTPM combines the best features of productive and PM procedures with innovative \nmanagement strategies and encourages total employee involvement. TPM focuses \nattention upon the reasons for energy losses from, and failures of equipment due to \ndesign weaknesses that the associated personnel previously thought they had to \ntolerate.  \n \nAutonomous maintenance looks into the means for achieving a high degree of \ncleanliness, excellent lubrication and proper fastening (e.g. tightening of nuts on bolts \nin the system) in order to inhibit deterioration and prevent machine breakdown. The \nJapanese Institute of Plant Maintenance in 1996 introduced autonomous maintenance \nfor operations as a role for all employees\u2019  in order to achieve greater financial profits. \n \nThe aim of TPM is to bring together management, supervisors and trade union \nmembers to take rapid remedial actions as and when required. Its main objectives are \nis to achieve zero breakdowns, zero defects and improved throughputs by: \n\u2022 Increasing operator involvement and ownership of the process. \n\u2022 Improving problem-solving by the team. \n\u2022 Refining preventive and predictive maintenance activities. \n\u2022 Focussing on reliability and maintainability engineering. \n\u2022 Upgrading each operator\u2019 s skills. \n \nThe TPM strategy includes: \n\u2022 Maximising equipment effectiveness. \n\u2022 Improving quality, increasing safety and reducing costs. \n\u2022 Raising the morale of the team that is implementing TPM. \n \nThe uppermost echelon of management should be highly committed to the setting of \nwise TPM goals, achieving sustainability, standardisation, pertinent education and \ntraining in TPM, measuring TPM effectiveness, developing an autonomous \nmaintenance programme and implementing Kaizen-teian programmes. Workshop \nmanagement is responsible for implementing TPM goals via group PM, small-group \nactivities, maximising equipment effectiveness, zero-accident and zero-pollution \naims, improving operating reliability, reducing the LCC, and problem solving. \n \nBenefits \n \nTPM helps organise maintenance activities by applying the following actions [8]: \n\u2022 Cultivate a sense of ownership in the operator by introducing autonomous \nmaintenance \u2013 the operator takes responsibility for the primary care of his\/her \nplant. The tasks include cleaning, routine inspection, lubrication, adjustments, \nminor repairs as well as the cleanliness of the local workspace. \n\u2022 Use cross-functional teams consisting of operators, maintainers, engineers and \nmanagers to improve individual employee and equipment performances. \n\u2022 Establish an optimal schedule of clean-up and PM to extend the plant\u2019 s life-\nspan and maximise its uptime. \n \nMany TPM operators have achieved excellent progress [11], in instances such as:- \n 7 \n\u2022 Wiser assessments of and improvements in the performance of critical \nequipment, e.g. in terms of OEE and determining what are the reasons for any \nnon-achievement. \n\u2022 Better understanding of the equipment\u2019 s criticality and where and when is it \nfinancially worth improving. \n\u2022 More cooperative teamwork e.g. less adversarial or competitive approaches \nbetween production and maintenance workers. \n\u2022 Improved procedures for (i) change-overs and set-ups, (ii) carrying out \nmaintenance tasks and (iii) better training of operators and maintainers: all of \nthese lead to reduced unit costs of production and better service. \n\u2022 Increased enthusiasm, loyalty and involvement of the workforce. \n \nImplementation of TPM forces fundamental rethinks of business processes to achieve \nlower unit costs, higher quality of end-product and more rapid production. \n \nRobert [10] concluded that TPM brings maintenance into focus as a necessary and \nvitally important part of the business: maintenance should no longer be regarded as a \nnon-profit-making activity. Downtime for maintenance is scheduled as an on-going \nactivity of the manufacturing process making it imperative to carry out maintenance \nnot solely when there is a failure in the production flow. The goal is to minimise the \nfrequency and magnitudes of emergency and unscheduled maintenance interruptions. \nHughes [12] pointed out that the profit-focussed approach to maintenance requires: \n\u2022 Frequent maintenance and breakdown-prevention measures implemented. \n\u2022 Training to improve the pertinent skills of all personnel \n\u2022 Higher effectiveness sought in newly-purchased equipment. \n \n \nAutomated factories are expensive \u2013 the consequences of a breakdown or malfunction \nare usually much more costly than in traditional plants. High machine-utilisation is \ncritical: achieving a high productivity depends on keeping the equipment functioning \nat peak levels, for as long as is feasible. Today, with competition increasing, \nsuccessful TPM may be one of the essential factors that determine whether some \norganisations, survive.  \n \n \nIntegrated automated plants require overseeing by pertinently-skilled, flexible and \ncommitted workers. High levels of competence are consistent with exalted \ninvolvement, employee participation, and self-managing teams. TPM prepares the \nplant to meet the challenge of a competitive global-economy. Hence, the overall \noutcome of TPM activities should improve the \n\u2022 Overall plant\u2019 s productivity (i.e. more effective operation and resource \nutilisation as well as the elimination of excessive inventory stocks). \n\u2022 Rate of throughput (by quicker action\/reaction to failure symptoms so leading \nto reduced downtimes). \n\u2022 End-product quality (e.g. by insisting on purchasing better designs) and \nservices (e.g. through better-maintained plant and machines). \n\u2022 Education and training of employees, so empowering them and raising morale, \nto keep pace with the complexity of evolving technologies. \n \n 8 \nThe process identifies the non-value-added activities within an organisation and then \nsystematically creates solutions to eliminate successively the most wasteful ones. \nMaintenance affects all aspects of business effectiveness - risk, safety, environmental \nsustainability achieved, energy efficiency, product quality and customer service, i.e. \nnot just plant availability and costs. Downtime has always affected adversely the \ncapability of physical assets by reducing output, increasing operating costs and \nlowering customer service [5]. \n \nEmployee empowerment is desirable in order to create excellent commitments \namongst the concerned personnel: for this, management, within the overall aims of the \norganisation, must involve employees in setting challenging targets and specifying \nhow to achieve them. Autonomy is the core concept of empowerment, while the \nmanagement retains control through information systems, choice of processes and \navailable tools [13]. \n \nIn a culture that stresses participation and autonomy, the function of the management \nshould not be solely to control but also to provide support and encouragement. \nDecisions on broadly-based issues, such as the implementation of TPM and RCM or \nthe introduction of a new reward convention for employees, are made only after the \nmanagement has entered into a dialogue with those affected.  The managers will \nprovide overall direction for the work that is clearly targeted and engaging. Their \ntasks will be those of consultants, mentors and coaches to help the employees avoid \nunnecessary waste of effort so that they can (i) increase their task-relevant knowledge \nand skills, and (ii) formulate creative, unique and appropriate performance strategies \nthat generate synergistic process gains. They should also be responsible for answering \nrequests from employees to ensure that the resources required for increasing \nperformance are available when needed.  \n \nCommunication is an exchange of information and understanding between two or \nmore persons or groups. Communication should be in the recipients\u2019  language and \nwithin his\/her understanding: therefore the message must be in terms of that \nindividual\u2019 s experience and perception.  Management processes, including training \nshould be designed from the point-of-view of the recipient and with a built-in \nmechanism for feedback.  Employees must be encouraged to set measurable but \nattainable goals. Employee training should focus on appropriate multi-skills and \nknowledge. Empowerment of employees by devolved authority to make decisions \nautonomously (i.e. subsidiarity) regarding TQM, so that each individual \u201c owns\u201d  the \nparticular process phase, is necessary. The objective throughout is continual \nimprovement. \n \nThe application of work measurement in maintenance is likely to generate significant \nproductivity improvements and cost reductions. Nevertheless, maintenance does not \nnormally receive the reasonably proportionate amount of attention that it deserves.  \n \nAssessing the effectiveness of a maintenance schedule is complicated because of the \nmultiple interactions involved. Hence, it is common practice to measure individual \naspects of maintenance performance [8]. The commonly used maintenance \nperformance indicators [14] are measures of :- \n\u2022 Equipment performance, such as availability, reliability and OEE. \n 9 \n\u2022 Process performance, such as the ratio of planned and unplanned work, as \nwell as of schedule compliance. \n\u2022 Cost performance, such as labour and material costs of maintenance \n \nThese diagnostic measures [15] will provide indications of whether the various \naspects of maintenance operations are effective or compare favourably with those \napplied elsewhere. Thus, they are used largely to support operational control and \nbenchmarking processes. However, these generic measures do not provide \ninformation for predicting the plant\u2019 s ability to create the future value needed to \nsupport the business success of the organisation. This purpose is achieved when the \nperformance measures are linked to the espoused strategy of the maintenance \nfunctions, known as strategic measures. Tsang [16] described the process for \nmanaging maintenance from a strategic perspective as shown in Figure 1. \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Strategic maintenance-management process \n \nA core feature of the process is the balanced score-card (BSC) that provides a \ncomprehensive presentation of strategic performance measures with respect to four \nperspectives: (i) financial, (ii) customer, (iii) internal processes, and (iv) learning and \ngrowth [17]. When the BSC is used, the strategy is translated into something more \ntangible, e.g. actionable long-run (strategic) objectives, the related performance-\nmeasures and their targets, as well as action plans.  \n \nThe performance indicators will highlight opportunities for improvement within \ncompanies. Performance-improvement measures should highlight any \u2018soft spots\u2019  in a \ncompany, then enable further analysis to find what is causing the associated low \nvalues of the indicators, and so ultimately point to a solution to the problem. One of \nthe performance measures should be taken at the corporate strategic level. A second \nlevel would be the financial indicator for a particular department or process. A third \nlevel would be an effectiveness indicator that highlights the departmental functions \nthat contribute to the effectiveness of the department. The fourth indicator is the \nmeasurement of the actual function itself. \n \nTPM does not provide a quick or easy solution. It usually requires changes in \nemployees\u2019  attitudes and values, which take time to imbibe. Therefore, it demands \nthinking for the long term and careful planning. Quick and company-wide \nperformance gains should not be expected during the initial phase [8]. However at this \nearly stage, top management must demonstrate their total commitment to TPM by \nallocating the necessary resources to create and sustain the cultural changes necessary \nAction plan: \nstructural and \ninfrastructural \nchanges \nCorporate \nStrategy \nMaintenance \nStrategy \nMaintenance \nobjectives \nImplementation \nof plan \nPerformance  \nmeasurement \nPeriodic \nreview \n 10 \nto provide relevant training to employees in order to achieve autonomous \nmaintenance. \n \n. Experience shows that wise planning and propitious timing of the associated actions \nare vitally important. To reduce uncertainty and enhance the chances of success \nduring the initial phase, small-scale pilot projects can be used to fine-tune plans for \nthe subsequent full-scale implementation [18]. \n \nTo apply TPM concepts successfully to plant-maintenance activities, the entire \nworkforce must first be convinced that the top-level management is committed to the \nprogramme. The senior management team sets company-wide PM policies; that is, \nplacing goal-setting central to the TPM programme promotional structure and \ncommittees. The middle management oversees the departmental polices, goal-setting \nand departmental PM promotional committees. The shop-floor management sets the \nPM goals according to team groups\u2019  activities. In all, this will involve design, \noperation, maintenance, engineering and sales activities, and may require hiring or \nappointing a TPM coordinator whose responsibility is to advocate through an \neducational programme the TPM concepts to the workforce, and check that they are \nbeing implemented. As soon as the coordinator is convinced that everybody involved \nhas bought into the idea of the TPM programme, a study and action team is formed \nand consists of representatives from those who directly have an impact on the problem \nbeing addressed. Operation and maintenance staff, shift supervisors, schedulers and \ntop management might all be in the team. Each person becomes a \u201c stakeholder\u201d  in the \nprocess and is encouraged to do his or her best to contribute to the success of the \nteam. Usually, the TPM coordinator heads the team until others become familiar with \nthe process and a team leader should then emerge naturally [10]. The action teams are \ncharged with the responsibility for pin-pointing the problems, indicating the remedial \nprocesses and in particular detailing a course of corrective actions. Sometimes, it may \neven be worthwhile for team members to pay visits to nominally-similar plants that \nhave attained world-class standards in order to observe TPM methods, techniques and \nobserve work in progress. \n \nThe teams are encouraged to start on small problem-solving projects and keep \nmeticulous records of their progress: once the teams are familiar with the TPM \nmethodology and achieved success in overcoming small problems, other more \ncomplex enigmas can be tackled. \n \nWhat then are best practices? How does one enterprise begin to benchmark other \ncompanies to help them achieve best practice within the organisation? How does an \nindustry come to know it has achieved world-class status? A definition of best \npractice, adapted to the maintenance process, is \u201c the integrated maintenance practices \nthat enable a company achieve a competitive advantage over its competitors in the \nmaintenance process\u201d . Specifically, benchmarking is the practice of measuring \nperformance against a preset standard. Benchmarking is used by industries to learn \nabout practices that have been proven to lead to superior performances and then to \nadopt them into their own organisational process. McQueen [19] suggested three \ntypes: \n\u2022 Internal benchmarking, whereby multiple-plant organisations set company-\nwide standards for each of the sites to follow, and then charts each site\u2019 s \nperformance relative to those standards. \n 11 \n\u2022 Industry benchmarking, where a company\u2019 s performance is measured against \nthose of other organisations in the same industrial sector.. \n\u2022 Best-practice  benchmarking, via which performance is measured against \nthose of other companies considered to be the leaders of that industry, \nregardless of the end product or provided service of the particular business. \n \nBenchmarking is performed preferably after a detailed internal audit has been \nconducted. \n \nOTHER MAINTENANCE-OPTIONS \n \nReliability-Centred Maintenance (RCM) \n \nRCM is a process used to decide what must be done to ensure that any physical \nsystem or process continues to accomplish whatever its users want it to do. What is \nexpected is defined in terms of primary performance parameters, such as output, \nthroughput, speed, range and capacity. Sometimes, the RCM process defines \nminimum standards which the users can tolerate in terms of risk (relating to safety and \nadverse environmental-impact), quality (in terms of precision, accuracy, consistency \nand stability), control, comfort, economy and customer service. This is followed by \nidentifying ways in which the system can fail to live up to these expectations (i.e. \nfailed states), and then by undertaking a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) \nidentify the events which are acceptable, and seek to identify an appropriate failure-\nmanagement policy for dealing with each failure mode in the light of its consequences  \nand technical characteristics. Failure management options include PM, predictive \nmaintenance, and run-to-failure, which can result in changing the design of the system \nand\/or the way it is operated [5]. \n \nPreventive Maintenance (PM) \n \nIn this kind of maintenance, items are replaced or restored to their optimal working \ncondition before a failure is allowed to occur. The policy can be based on scheduled, \ntime-based or condition-based PM. In the former approach, PM is performed on the \nitem at a scheduled time regardless of its actual state of deterioration. The schedules \ncan be based period of usage or cycle time. The schedule is often drawn up on the \nsupplier\u2019 s recommendation, which usually only considers limited knowledge of the \nactual local conditions. Therefore, it is often better to draw from experience. PM \nschedules that minimise resource consumption or maximise availability can be \ndetermined with quantitative decision-models. Parameters featured in these models \nare information, such as time-to-failure distribution, costs of intervention (inspection, \nrepair or replacement) and consequences of failure. \n \nCondition-Based Maintenance (CBM) \n \nUnder the regime of scheduled PM, some items may be over-maintained, that is \nreplaced prematurely, i.e. before they have suffered significant deteriorations. \nHowever, if the condition of the component can be monitored continuously or \nintermittently but sufficiently, it will be possible to carry out PM actions only when a \nfailure is judged to be imminent [8]. This is the concept of CBM. Performance \nparameter analysis, vibration monitoring, thermography, oil analysis and ferrography \n 12 \nare some of the condition-monitoring techniques that are employed in CBM. Each of \nthese methods is designed to detect a specific category of faults. For example, \nvibration monitoring can detect wear, imbalance, misalignment of components, \nloosened assemblies or turbulence in a plant with rotational or reciprocating parts. \n \nThe design can be modified to achieve improved reliability, enhanced maintainability, \nminimum maintenance resource requirements and so even eliminate the need for \nroutine maintenance. \n \nUnder the run-to-failure (RTF) approach, only routine servicing is performed on the \nitem until it fails. This can be justified when the affect of failure is inconsequential or \nthe cost of preventive measures would exceed the expected benefits of improved \nreliability of higher availability. \n \nCondition Monitoring \n \nNon-destructive testing, vibration measurement, thermography, ferrography and \nspectroscopy make it possible to undertake non-intrusive inspections. By applying \nthese technologies, the condition of the equipment can be monitored continuously or \nintermittently while it is operating.  This gave birth to CBM, which is an alternative to \nthe classic, time-driven approach of PM [20].Power electronics, programmable logic \ncontrollers (PLCs), computer controls, transponders and telecommunication systems \nare increasingly being introduced as substitutes for electromechanical systems. They \noffer the relative benefits of improved reliability, greater flexibility, compactness,  \nless weight and lower cost. Fly-by-wire technology, utilising software \u2013 controlled \nelectronic systems, has become commonplace for the current generation of aircraft. \nCorrespondingly, flexible cells and computer-integrated systems are gaining \nacceptance in manufacturing [8]. The deployment of these new technologies is \ninstrumental in enhancing a system\u2019 s availability, improving the cost effectiveness of \nits operations and achieving better or innovative services for customers.  \n \nTHEORY AND BEHAVIOURAL MODELS \n \nSystem\u2019 s Performance \n \nThe overall performance of a production system is determined by both quantitative \nand qualitative properties of the system. These characteristics are found for all its \ncomponents and for the complete system. See, for example, Figure 3. It includes some \nparameters that can be defined as follows: \n 13 \n.  \nFigure 3: Contributory factors to the system\u2019 s performance \n \n\u2022 System\u2019 s overall performance-the total production over a long period such as \nthe lifetime of the system. \n\u2022 Capability performance-the average production per unit time normally related \nto the rated capacity. If a plant operates at 100% capacity and the end-product \nis of 100% quality, the capability performance is 100 percent. \n\u2022 Availability performance-the proportion of the total calendar time during \nwhich the equipment is active in its economic production condition. If the \ncondition does not permit production at its fully-rated capacity, with the \nproduct quality at the specified level, the equipment is experiencing one or \nmore failures and needs maintenance. When idle awaiting or during \nmaintenance, the equipment is not available for production. \n\u2022 Operational Performance-the capability of the operation to utilise the \nequipment relative to its maximum ability and availability. It will depend upon \nproduction planning and control, having well-trained personnel as well as the \nagreement of the safety department. Motivation of the individuals involved has \na major influence on the operational performance. \n\u2022 Capacity Performance-the ability of the equipment to produce, at the rated \ncapacity, always satisfying the specified quality required. \n\u2022 Reliability Performance-the ability of the equipment to perform the required \nfunction when operated. If the behaviour does not meet the specification, the \nequipment is suffering from a failure and needs maintenance. The reliability \nperformance is normally described by the probability of reliability:- \nR (t) = ( )Wexp\nMTBF\nt\n exp \u2212=\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212   \nwhere t = specified period, \u03bb = failure rate = \nMTBF\n1\n, and  MTBF = mean time \nbetween failures. \n \n\u2022 Maintainability Performance\u2013properties determining the time to repair, which \ndictates the \u2018mean-time-to-repair\u2019 , MTTR, which has little to do with the \nperformance of the maintenance resources but is more dependent on the design \nand installation of the production equipment.  \nSystem\u2019 s Overall \nPerformance \nCapability \nPerformance \nAvailability \nPerformance \nOperator \nPerformance \nCapacity \nPerformance \nReliability \nPerformance \nMaintainability \nPerformance \nSupport \nPerformance \nOperation \nSystem \nTechnical \nSystem \nLogistic \nSystem \n 14 \n=Number of  \ngood products \nProcess \ndefects \nStart-up  \ndefects \nTrail \nproducts \nUsed input +- \n Maintainability (Mt) = ( )Wexp\nMTTR\nt\nexp \u2212=\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212   \n Where \u00b5 = repair rate = 1\/\u03c4 , and \u03c4 = restoration time or duration of \noutage, i.e. the MTTR (= \u03c4) \n \n\u2022 Support Performance-the ability of the logistic support system, or maintenance \nsystem to provide back-up for the equipment when maintenance is required. It \ndepends on the organisation of the maintenance procedures and the resources \navailable (e.g. tools, personnel, skills and spares). The performance is \nmeasured in mean waiting time (MWT) or mean logistic downtime (MLDT). \nThe theoretically correct method of computing the availability performance is \nto use the calendar time as 100 percent. This approach is mostly used for \nsystems that are supposed to work around the clock, such as in some process \nindustries.  \n \nThe overall equipment effectiveness OEE is determined via: \n \n \nwhere: \n\u2022 Availability (or Operating factor) = (Loading time \u2013Down time)\/Loading time \n               = (Uptime \u2013 Downtime)\/Uptime  \n\u2022 Performance Rate = \n \n\u2022 Quality Achieved = (Number of good products)\/Used input \n \n \n \n \nSpeed losses can be reduced and quality of end-product can be improved as shown \nin Table 1 and Figure 4 respectively. \n \nTable 1: Strategy for reducing speed-losses: the actions are presented in this Table as \nensuing in series, but in practice some would occur in parallel with one another. \n \nAction Associated parameters and considerations \nDetermine present levels \nof speed losses and their \nconsequences on the \nconsidered activity \nSpeed, bottleneck processes, downtime, frequency of \nstoppages, condition-producing defects. \nCheck difference between \nspecifications and present \nsituation \nWhat are the specifications?

Poor maintenance \nresults in lost production, poor end-quality of product and lack of customer \nsatisfaction. \nMany factors contribute to excellent maintenance performance. Consistency is \nachieved s a result of understanding well what needs to be done, following standard \npractices, working with excellent engineering support, and providing inspiring \ntraining for the personnel involved. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nAs Nigerian industrial managers are seeking to inculcate a competitive outlook in \ntheir manufacturing industries, they need to posses a culture that deals more \neffectively with rapid changes. The introduction of TPM will help in achieving this. \nTPM is predicated by the challenge of seeking to do things better \u2013 hence dealing \neffectively with change (often requiring rapid alteration) needs to become a way of \nlife within manufacturing organisations. The willingness of employees within an \norganisation to accept \u201c change\u201d  for the better is an essential prerequisite for \nsuccessfully implementing TPM. Their degree of eagerness to embrace \u201c change\u201d  \ndetermines the rate of progress towards that goal. TPM can only succeed in an \norganisation that is committed to provide the necessary training and time to monitor \nthe success or failure of the ensuing improvement initiatives. For the full \nimplementation and achieving sustainability of TPM in Nigeria, using the proposed \nmodels and strategies, there should be a new thoughtware and recalibration of what is \nexpected in existing organisations: this should be self-audited and benchmarked \nagainst world-class industries with similar product lines.  \n \n 18 \nWith competition in manufacturing industries rising relentlessly, TPM can be the \nmaintenance philosophy prevents the failure of an organisation. It is a maintenance \nprogramme that works with TQM and lean management. However, the employees \nmust be appropriately trained, empowered and convinced that TPM is sustainable and \nthe management should be totally committed to the programme. Nigerian industrial \nmanagers must move away from traditional reactive maintenance procedures to \nimplementing more proactive maintenance processes. By better planning of \nmaintenance schedules, less energy and effort are wasted, improved productivity \noccurs and greater financial surpluses are achieved. \n \nReferences \n1. Ohno, T.
