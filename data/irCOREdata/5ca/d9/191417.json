During pregnancy, trophoblast \ndifferentiates into either villous trophoblast or \nextravillous trophoblast (EVTs). EVT\u2019s remodel \nspiral arterioles. Trophoblasts express greater \nanti-pan-cytokeratin immunoreactivity in EVTs \ncompared than in villous trophoblast. Here we \ninvestigate expression of cytokeratins 7 and 18 \nusing indirect immunofluorescence confocal laser \nscanning microscopy (CLSM) of freshly delivered \ncryo-fixed term-placental basal plate tissues. For \nboth CKs, EVTs were more immunofluorescent \nthan villous trophoblast. Non-epithelial tissue \nlevels of fluorescence were close to background. \nFor CK7, there was a > 10 fold difference \n[Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test Z= - 6.501, p= 0.000] \nin the mean area percent of a banded zone of the \nmost intensely fluorescent pixels, when equal \nsize areas containing villous trophoblast and \nEVTs were compared. A similar result was \nobtained for CK18 [Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test Z= - \n8.339, p=0.000]. Similar results are indicated \nusing CK19 and CK5. Summarising cytokeratins \n7 and 18 are upregulated in extavillous \ntrophoblast following differentiation. Since these \nproteins are representatives of the two \nsubfamilies, and taken together with the \npancytokeratin data it appears that this may be a \ngeneralised phenomenon in the CK gene family. \nThe upregulation of CKs in EVTs may favour \ntheir migration into the basal plate to remodel the \nspiral arterioles in normal placentation. \n"}
