There is \nstill an urgent need for new markers and particularly those identifying \nsignificant cancers. This study evaluates a transcription factor secreted by \nprostate cancer as a simple ELISA test without the requirement for DRE.  The \nsensitivity, specificity and stability of EN2 at room temperature would make \nthis test attractive for diagnosis of prostate cancer and also potentially as a \nsimple screening tool in the community. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\nAbstract \n \nPurpose: Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cause of cancer \nrelated death in men. A number of key limitations with prostate specific \nantigen (PSA), currently the standard detection test, has justified evaluation of \nnew biomarkers. We have assessed the diagnostic potential of EN2 protein, a \nhomeodomain-containing transcription factor expressed in PC cell lines and \nsecreted into the urine by PC in men.  \n \nExperimental Design: EN2 expression in PC cell lines and prostate cancer \ntissue was determined by semi-quantative RT-PCR and \nimmunohistochemistry. First pass urine (without prior digital rectal \nexamination (DRE)) was collected from men presenting with urinary \nsymptoms (referred to exclude\/confirm the presence of prostate cancer) and \nfrom controls. EN2 protein was measured by ELISA in urine from men with \nPC (n=82) and controls (n=102). \n \nResults: EN2 was expressed and secreted by PC cell lines and PC tissue but \nnot by normal prostate tissue or stroma. The presence of EN2 in urine was \nhighly predictive of PC, with a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 88.2%, \nwithout requirement for DRE. There was no correlation with PSA levels. \nThese results were confirmed independently by a second academic centre. \n \n 4\nConclusions: Urinary EN2 is a highly specific and sensitive candidate \nbiomarker of prostate cancer. A larger multicentre study to further evaluate \nthe diagnostic potential of EN2 is justified.  \n \n \n 5\nIntroduction \n \nProstate cancer (PC) is the second most common cause of cancer related \ndeath in men, with approximately 913,000 new cases world wide in 2008 (1). \nLocalised, organ-confined PC can be cured in a large proportion of patients by \nsurgery or radiotherapy. Advanced and metastatic PC continues to be \nassociated with a poor prognosis (2). Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) \nhas been used as a cancer marker for initial diagnosis, monitoring of \nresponse to treatment, prediction of PC risk and of treatment outcome. As a \nprostate-specific and not prostate cancer-specific marker, it lacks both \nsensitivity and specificity to accurately detect the presence of PC, requires \nadjustment for age and prostate volume, is frequently raised in non-cancer \nconditions such as benign hypertrophy and prostatitis and so far has been \ncontroversial as a screening tool (3-5). A conventional cut off level of 4ng\/ml \nhas predictive value for detection of the prostate cancer (6,7)  but only 15% of \ncancers were detected at prostate biopsy in the Prostate Cancer Prevention \nTrial (PCPT) (8). Higher detection rates of up to 44% have been reported at \nthis PSA level in other studies, but these, unlike PCPT, did not evaluate \nhealthy asymptomatic men (8-10). Studies of men at different ages also \nsuggests differential incidence of prostate cancer. For the third through eighth \ndecades of life, the incidence of prostate cancer in the cohort of 1051 subjects \nstudied by Sakr et al was 7%, 23%, 39%, 44%, and 65%, respectively (11). \nLowering PSA cut off levels results in higher sensitivity at the expense of \nmuch lower specificity and true negative rates of 70-80% (8, 12, 13). No \nrefinement of PSA (e.g. free: total PSA ratio) or other biomarkers have \n 6\nreduced this true negative rate (13).There is therefore an urgent need for new \nmarkers to overcome at least some of the limitations of serum PSA. \n \nBiomarkers signifying the presence of any cancer may be defined on the \nbasis of gene products uniquely expressed or overexpressed in tissue, serum \nor urine, in cancer compared to non-cancer. A number of genes are involved \nin early embryonic development and are subsequently re-expressed in \ncancer, for example the HOX genes, a family of homeodomain-containing \ntranscription factors that determine the early identity of cells and tissues (14). \nWe and others have shown that HOX gene dysregulation occurs in most \ncommon cancers, with evidence that targeting HOX\/PBX binding has \ntherapeutic value (15-19). We have studied Engrailed-2 (En2), another \nmember of this group which show a very high degree of functional \nconservation during development (20). En2 is a transcriptional repressor, but \nis also has a role in translational regulation (20). In addition to its \ndevelopmental role, En2 has recently been shown to be a potential oncogene \nin breast cancer, as forcing its expression in the non-malignant mammary \ncells induces a malignant phenotype including increased cell proliferation and \na loss of contact dependence (21).  \n \nIn this study we show that En2 is expressed in, and secreted by, prostate \ncancer but not normal prostatic tissue. The presence of EN2 protein in urine \nhas been evaluated as a diagnostic biomarker for PC. \n \n \n 7\n Materials and Methods \n \nPatient and controls  \nThis study was approved by the local research ethics committee (reference \n09\/H1109\/84), and took place between June 2007 to June 2010. In total 194 \nurine samples were collected by the Surrey site. Men with lower urinary tract \nsymptoms, individuals concerned they may have an asymptomatic PC (e.g. a \npositive family history) and men with an abnormal PSA test reading conducted \nby their family physician were referred into our specialist Uro-Oncology clinic. \nThe purpose of the referral was to exclude or confirm the presence of prostate \ncancer. Men with known PC on treatment, with any other known concurrent or \nprevious cancers within 10 years or urinary tract infection (as determined by \nthe presence of leukocytes using a dipstick test) were excluded. Urine \nsamples from patients and controls were collected prospectively; samples \nwere blinded to laboratory staff at the time of EN2 measurement.  \nTwo control groups of men >40 years were also assessed: \n(a) \u2018low PSA group A\u2019; men presenting to haematuria clinics where no \nurothelial malignancy was found (single episode of haematuria: radiology, \ncystoscopy and cytology negative) but in whom DRE and PSA (routinely \nperformed in this clinic) were normal, PSA below 2\u00b75 ng\/ml. \n (b) \u2018low PSA group B\u2019; men over 40 years with no symptoms or family history \nof PC and who had undergone routine health screening by family physicians \n(conducted once or twice yearly: physical examination, diabetes screening of \nserum and urine, serum cholesterol and serum PSA levels even in the \n 8\nabsence of lower urinary tract symptoms and family history of prostate \ncancer) and had a documented PSA below 2\u00b75 ng\/ml. \nThe majority of samples were donated the day after consultation. 5-10mls of \nfirst pass urine samples were donated pre-biopsy, prior to any hormone \ntherapy and not immediately after DRE (range 4-24 hours post DRE). For the \nnon-cancer control groups no DRE was performed prior to urine donation.  \nUrine was stored in 1\u00b75 ml aliquots at -80\u00b0C. Blood for PSA analysis was \nalways drawn before urine collection. Histological examination of prostate \nbiopsies was performed by a specialist uro-pathologist. The 2003 UICC TNM \nclassification was applied. Gleason scores, clinical stage and PSA were \navailable in all cancer cases.  \n \nEN2 protein detection \u2013 western blotting \n1\u00b75ml of urine were centrifuged at 10,000g for five minutes to remove cells \nand cellular debris. 20\u03bcl of the supernatant were then mixed directly with gel \nrunning buffer (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).   Proteins were resolved by 10% \nSDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene \nfluoride membrane (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).  Anti-EN2 antibody (ab45867; \nAbcam, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK) was used at a concentration of \n0\u00b75\u00b5g\/ml, and a goat-anti human IgG peroxidise-labelled antibody was used \ntogether with the ECL chemiluminescent system for detection. \n \nEN2 protein detection \u2013 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) \nTwo monoclonal mouse anti-EN2 antibodies were raised using the \nsynthetically produced C-terminal 100 amino acids (Biosynthesis Inc, \nLewisville, Texas,  USA) of EN2 as an antigen (Antibody Production Services \n 9\nLtd, Haywards Heath, Sussex, UK). One of these, APS1, was conjugated to \nalkaline phosphatase using the Lightning Link alkaline phosphatase \nconjugation kit (Innova Biosciences, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK), whilst \nthe other, APS2, was conjugated to biotin using the Lightning Link Biotin \nConjugation kit (Innova Biosciences, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK). \nAPS2-biotin was captured onto a 96-well streptavidin-coated plate (Nunc \n436014, Rochester, New York, USA) at a concentration of 4\u03bcg \/ml. After \nwashing, 100\u03bcl of urine or a dilution of the EN2 fragment in buffer was \nincubated in each well for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate was then \nwashed 8 times in buffer (PBS with 0\u00b71% Tween-20) and the secondary \ndetection antibody \u2013 APS1-Alkaline phosphatase was added to each well at a \nconcentration of 4\u03bcg\/ml (1 hour at room temperature). After a final wash step \na colormetric agent \u2013 pNPP (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was added and the \nabsorption of light at 405nm was measured after one hour. The dilution series \nwas used to generate a standard curve by which the concentration of EN2 in \neach sample was measured (supplemental figure 2). \n \ncDNA Synthesis  \nRNA from prostate tumours and normal adjacent tissue was obtained from \nurology clinic patients. Prostate biopsy tissue was taken contiguous to a \nroutine sextant biopsy (from which histology was later confirmed), placed in \nOCT (optimal cutting compound), snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. \nRNA was reverse transcribed as described previously (16). RNA was first \ndenatured by heating at 65oC for five minutes. 1-5\u03bcg of RNA was incubated in \na volume of 50\u03bcl at 37oC for one hour with final concentrations of 10mM DTT, \n 10\n1mM dNTP mix, as well as 100ng\/\u03bcl polyT primers, 200 units of reverse \ntranscriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 40 units of RNaseOUT \n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).  The cDNA synthesis reaction was \nterminated by placing tubes at 80oC for five minutes. \n \nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR \nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Stratagene MX4000 Real \nTime PCR machine, measuring PCR product accumulation during the \nexponential phase of the reaction by SYBR green fluorescence. Reaction \nconditions were 1 cycle of 94oC for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 30 \nseconds at 94oC, 1 minute at 60oC and 30 seconds at 72oC. The forward and \nreverse primers for En2 were 5\u2019 GAACCCGAACAAAGAGGACA 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 \nCGCTTGTTCTGGAACCAAAT 3\u2019, and for Beta actin they were 5\u2019 \nATGTACCCTGGCATTGCCGAC 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 GACTCGTCATACTCCTGCTTG \n3\u2019. \n \nImmunohistochemistry \nExpression of EN2 in PC and normal prostate was investigated using 3\u03bcm \nthick formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue array (PR2085a, US Biomax, \nRockville, MD, USA) and patient prostate biopsies. Immunohistochemical \nanalysis was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-EN2 antibody (Abcam, \nCambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK #28731) diluted 1:100 and the ABC \ndetection method with peroxidase block (DakoCytomation). Brain sections \nwere used as a positive control. Antigen retrieval was performed using pH9.0 \nTris\/EDTA buffer (DakoCytomation) and heating in a microwave for 23 \n 11\nminutes. The tissue arrays described in this study were stained using the \nsame method and were obtained from Biomax US (PR2085a). \n \nCell culture \nPC3 (22), DU145 (23), and LNCaP (24), prostate cancer cell lines, together \nwith WPMY-1, a non-malignant fibroblast line derived from prostate stroma \n(25), were obtained from the ATCC (through LGC Standards UK), and \nmaintained according to ATCC protocols supplied for each cell line. The \nconditioned media used for EN2 detection was taken from cells grown to 90% \nconfluence without a media change after seeding 10% confluence. \n \nStatistical analysis \nThe Graphpad prism package was used in statistical calculations. In order to \ntest the significance of differences between mean EN2 concentrations in \ndifferent patient groups we used an unpaired t-test with Welch\u2019s correction. \nReceiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were generated for the EN2 \nand PSA values. The area under the curve was tested for significance using \nan unpaired t-test against the hypothesis that the real area under the curve \nwas 0\u00b75 (i.e. no diagnostic value). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12\nResults \n \nThe complex regulatory functions and oncogenic potential (20) of En2 led us \nfirstly to study the expression of En2 in PC cell lines. The differential \nexpression of En2 by malignant versus non-cancer cells was studied by \nmeasuring the number of En2 transcripts in the human PC cell lines PC3, \nDU145, and LNCaP together with a non-malignant cell line derived from \nnormal prostate fibroblasts, WPMY-1 (Fig 1a). Of these lines, PC3, DU145 \nand LNCaP all expressed En2. In addition, RNA was extracted from prostate \nbiopsy cores and En2 expression quantified by quantitative PCR. Of 12 cores \nthat were histologically positive for cancer 10 expressed En2, whilst none of \nthe 8 cores negative for cancer showed En2 expression (Fig 1b). As EN2 \nprotein can be secreted physiologically from some types of cell (20, 26) we \nlooked for the protein in the conditioned medium surrounding PC3, DU145, \nLNCaP and WPMY-1 cells by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).  \nPC3, LNCaP and DU145 cell lines release EN2 protein into the surrounding \nmedium, but not WPMY-1 (Fig 1c), and immunofluorescent imaging of EN2 in \nPC3 cells revealed a high concentration of this protein close to the membrane \nconsistent with its secretory potential (Fig 1d). \n \nThese findings were supported by immunohistochemical study of PC and \nnormal prostatic tissue using an anti-EN2 antibody stain in a large \nrepresentative 195 core tissue array and in patient biopsies. In the tissue \narray EN2 was highly expressed in prostate cancer (92%, n=184 prostate \ncancer cores), but not in normal tissue adjacent to the tumour (0%, n=11), or \n 13\nin normal prostate cores (0%, n=9). We found no evidence of EN2 staining in \nnormal prostate tissue, benign hypertrophy nor in men with HGPIN (high \ngrade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia) in any tissue array section or biopsy \nfrom our patients. Analysis of larger tumour sections taken by biopsy revealed \nEN2 expression is most intense in the duct like structures of tumours (Fig 2a-\nc), and that EN2 protein is present in the cytoplasm, and in some cases in the \nbasal membrane, but not in the nucleus (Fig 2c). Furthermore, blebs \ncontaining EN2 protein are apparent in prostatic acini and ducts (Fig 2b, c).  \nThis widespread distribution contrasts markedly with normal adult purkinje \nneurons where EN2 protein, as expected, is confined to the nucleus (27) \n(supplemental Fig 1). We also compared the staining of EN2 to that of a \nknown prostate cancer specific antigen, alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A \nracemase (AMACR) (28); merged images of each staining pattern show an \nalmost complete overlay (Fig 2d-f).  \n \nGiven the secretory properties of EN2 in embryonic development (29) and the \nobservation of EN2-positive blebs within the lumen of malignant prostatic \nducts, we looked for EN2 protein in the urine of men with biopsy-confirmed \nbut untreated PC and controls. EN2 protein in untreated, unconcentrated \nurine from PC patients could be detected by western blotting with a band \ncorresponding to full length EN2 protein (33kDa; Fig 3), but not after \nprostatectomy in the same patients and not in non-cancer individuals.  \n \nThe ELISA assay for EN2 (supplemental Fig 2) was used to screen \nrepresentative populations of patients with prostate cancer and relevant \n 14\ncontrols. The stability of EN2 protein in urine was shown to be at least four \ndays at room temperature (supplemental Fig 3), allowing postal collection of \nsome samples.  The demographics of patients and control groups are shown \nin table 1. The mean age of men in the study was similar (range 57-67 years). \nMedian PSA (6\u00b73-7\u00b76 ng\/ml) was similar in men suspected of PC versus the \ntwo low PSA control groups (0\u00b79-1\u00b71 ng\/ml), as expected. Using a cut off of \n42\u00b75\u03bcg\/L, EN2 protein was detected in 54 of the 82 (66%) men with PC \nconfirmed by biopsy (\u2018Biopsy (+)\u2019). Notably, in 9 men in this EN2 positive \ngroup the PSA was < 2.5 ng\/ml. In men with high PSA and no cancer on \nbiopsy (\u2018Biopsy (-)\u2019), EN2 was detected in 6 of 58 (10\u00b73%). In our control \ngroups EN2 detection was also infrequent: in \u2018low PSA group A\u2019 EN2 was \ndetected in 2 of 17 (11\u00b77%); in low PSA group B EN2 was detected in 4 of 27 \n(14\u00b78%). An exceptionally high level of EN2 was found in the urine of one \nindividual in control \u2018low PSA group B\u2019 who had a PSA of 1.2ng\/ml. \n \nAn ROC analysis for this data (Biopsy (+) v Biopsy (-)) revealed that the area \nunder the curve was 0.8021 (p<0\u00b7001), indicating a high diagnostic potential \nfor EN2 (Fig 4b). The mean concentration of EN2 protein was 10\u00b74 fold higher \nin PC patients compared to that in all the men that were not known to have \ncancer (Fig 4a). We found no significant correlation between EN2 expression \nand combined Gleason score, although the majority of patients in our cohort \nhad disease with a combined Gleason score of 6 or 7 (Fig 5a). There was \nalso no significant correlation between serum PSA level and presence or \nabsence of urinary EN2 (Fig 5b). EN2 was also found in the urine of 3 of 10 \nmen (30%) with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN; Table \n 15\n1; Fig 4a); two of these 3 men were found to have PC within 6 months upon \nre-biopsy. \nIn order to validate our findings with respect to urinary EN2 secretion, a \nsimilar study was completed independently at Cambridge University following \nthe same collection protocol. EN2 detection by ELISA followed exactly the \nsame protocol as for the Surrey University study. The results are summarised \nin Table 1 and are similar to those obtained for the Surrey patients. Of 13 \ncontrol patients two were found to have EN2 in their urine (15%), whilst 47 of \n81 patients with prostate cancer were positive for EN2 (58%). \n 16\nDiscussion \n \nIn this study we have shown that the transcription factor En2 is expressed by \nPC-derived cell lines and in primary prostate tumours, but not in normal \nprostate tissue. Our data indicates that EN2 protein is also secreted by both \ncell lines and primary tumours, and is found in the majority of PC patients in \nfirst pass urine collected without preceding DRE, but not in non-cancer \ncontrols. We found that EN2 is associated with a sensitivity of 66% and \nspecificity of almost 90% using the 42\u00b75 ng\/ml cut off. The maximum \nspecificity that can be achieved using this assay is 100%, using a cut off at \n1927 ng\/ml, but the resulting sensitivity is only 2\u00b75%. The maximum sensitivity \n(73%) is achieved using a cut off at 1\u00b75 ng\/ml and the resulting specificity is \n80%. The cut off value of 42\u00b75 ng\/ml was selected to give both high sensitivity \nand specificity. \n \nPSA is a valuable tool for the early detection and monitoring of PC, but PSA \nvalues vary with prostate volume, age and raised levels are seen in non-\ncancer disorders such as prostatitis. The specificity and sensitivity of PSA has \nbeen difficult to fully determine as men with low PSA levels rarely undergo \nbiopsy. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) biopsied 5112  men in \nthe placebo arm  irrelevant of PSA level. A PSA >4ng\/ml had a sensitivity of \n24% and specificity of 93% (30). The same study confirmed clinical \nexperience that some PC are associated with very low levels of PSA \nproduction. PC was present in 6\u00b76% of men where PSA <0\u00b75ng\/ml and 27% \nmen had PSA of 3\u00b71-4 ng\/ml (8). Ultimately the choice of PSA \u2018cut off\u2019 \n 17\nbalancing sensitivity against specificity results in false positive tests and large \nnumbers of unnecessary biopsies (31, 32). A recent study has indicated that \nPC mortality may be reduced almost by half over 14 years by early detection \nby PSA in a screening program. Although this was achieved at the expense of \n\u2018over diagnosis\u2019 the potential value of biomarkers in early disease was \ndemonstrated (5). There have been no new serum based prostate cancer \ndetection tests sufficiently specific or sensitive to reach the clinic in the last \ndecade. Recently published urine-based tests share the limitations of PSA to \nvarying extents and mostly require urine collection post-DRE. Most notable \namongst these is PCA3, a non-coding RNA present in urine (33) and Annexin \nA3 (34). PCA3 has a higher specificity than PSA (76% to 89%) and the \ndetection rate of PC is reported to be 34%, but it still gives significant numbers \nof false positive results (33). Furthermore it requires urine post-DRE and is \nexpensive and complex to use. It is used to help decide whether to proceed to \nrepeat prostate biopsy in cases where the PSA is persistently high.  Annexin \nA3 is a protein present at higher concentrations in patients that have PC, and \nhas a sensitivity and specificity of 31.2% and 90%, respectively (34). It only \nhas utility in conjunction with urinary PSA measurements, which themselves \nare subject to all the potential flaws of serum PSA discussed earlier. Other \nrecently described urinary prostate cancer biomarker approaches that have \nbeen based on matrix modelling of multiple markers (35) are complex, not \nimmediately applicable to routine clinical practice and may be more \nappropriate for stratifying patients in clinical trials. In contrast, EN2 can be \ndetected in 100\u03bcl of unprocessed urine, collected without the requirement for \nDRE and employs a simple enzymatic detection method. DRE expels cells \n 18\ninto urine and is the basis of tests such as PCA3 where mRNA from these \nexpelled cells is extracted. EN2 is secreted by the prostate cancer cells, the \ncellular component of the collected urine is discarded and only the \nsupernatant evaluated after spinning down. We have seen negligible changes \nin EN2 concentrations pre-DRE and post-DRE urine to date (n=12). This is \nbeing further evaluated in our current follow up study in larger numbers of \nindividuals. The clinical potential of EN2 is further supported by our findings of \nits stability in urine at room temperature for at least 4 days without \npreservative allowing routine transport of samples to diagnostic labs.   \n \nThe high predictive value of urinary EN2 raises the possibility that it could be \nused alongside PSA in the primary diagnosis of PC in patients presenting with \nlower urinary tract symptoms or a family history of PC, and reduce \nunnecessary prostate biopsies. Further potential utility of EN2 as a prostate \ncancer biomarker was demonstrated by its presence in the urine of men with \nlow PSA (<2.5 \u03bcg\/L) but histologically confirmed prostate cancer on biopsy \n(n=9). Non-PSA secreting PC represent a small proportion of all cases but are \nproblematic (36). This study found high levels of EN2 in the urine of one \nindividual from our control group 1 (he was asymptomatic:no urinary \nsymptoms, weight loss or pain suspicious of metastatic involvement,  and had \na PSA of 1\u00b72 during a general health screening by his family physician). It is of \ncourse possible that he and individuals designated \u2018false positive\u2019 in this study \nmay be harbouring non-PSA secreting PC or have PC present in transitional \nzone or the anterior horn of the peripheral zone. This patient was discussed \nwith the ethics committee and referred to a urologist for further assessment.  \n 19\n The  ELISA based assay we have developed will potentially allow a number of \ndifferent detection platforms including a lateral flow application with a \u2018dip \nstick\u2019 test  which could be performed quickly and cheaply in primary care or as \na component of a large scale screening program (if justified by further \nstudies). EN2 may therefore be positioned as an adjunct to PSA for diagnosis \nin symptomatic or \u2018at risk\u2019 individuals (e.g. positive family history,  HGPIN), in \nmen with \u2018bordeline\u2019 PSA levels or in general population screening in view of \nits simplicity and no requirement for DRE.  The greatest uptake would most \nlikely be by family physicians for these reasons. The expression of EN2 in the \ntissue and urine of individuals with other urothelial cancers (renal, bladder and \nureteric) is currently being determined to address its ultimate specificity for \nprostate cancer. In addition, a larger multicentre study is planned to determine \nwhether EN2 could be used as a monitoring tool (PSA was originally \napproved for this purpose), the effect of surgery, hormonal and radiotherapy \non EN2 secretion into urine, and also whether levels of urinary EN2 correlate \nwith tumour stage and Gleason grade. However, as with every PC biomarker \nin development, the ultimate question will be centred around the utility of EN2 \n(alone or in combination with other markers) in identifying \u2018significant\u2019 cancers \nthat require early intervention. \n \n \n \n \n \n 20\nReferences \n1 Ferlay J, Shin HR, Bray F, Forman D, Mathers C, Parkin DM. \nEstimates of worldwide burden of cancer in 2008: GLOBOCAN 2008.
