Introduction\nEstablished standards for the engineering of systems such as ANSI\/EIA 632 and ISO\/IEC 15288 support a\nseamless process of converting customer needs into systems\/technical requirements, which are subsequently\ntransformed into logical representations and finally into physical solution representations. The process is\napplied recursively to subsequent, lower levels of the product decomposition. Integration, test and verification\nfollow from the lower to the higher levels of granularity. Axiomatic Design (Suh 1990 and 2001) follows to\nan extent this philosophy through a process called zigzagging. However, neither Axiomatic Design (AD) nor\nthe standards prescribe a process for customer needs identification \u2013 traditionally this has been the territory of\nmarket analysis. Consistency and communication between the customer and the design domains is therefore\nessential in the definition of adequate requirements and the identification of possible variability of the already\ndefined requirements. Variability of design characteristics can contribute to the complexity of the design (El-\nHaik and Yang, 1999) which, in turn, can affect technical risk and costs. It is proposed in this work that in\naddition to variability, any statistical correlations of requirements and design parameters have to be taken into\nconsideration when exploring a particular design in order to identify performance sensitivities.\nThe broader aim of the paper is to demonstrate that a proposed combination of covariance structure models\nand latent variable models, called SEMDES, represents an underlying generic structure which bridges the gap\nbetween the customer and the design domains. Consequently SEMDES (Structure Equation Models for the\nDesign of Engineering Systems) should be able to aid the definition of customer needs, their subsequent\n* Corresponding author.

SEMDES is also\nintended to provide a richer model of the design domain by accounting for the effects of variability and\ncorrelation of the functional requirements (FRs), possible (historic) correlation between FRs and Design\nParameters (DPs), and also for any correlation or causal relations between the DPs.\nThe following two sections (2 and 3) introduce the basic postulates, definitions and notation of Axiomatic\nDesign and the Covariance Structure Models, both of which are extensively referred to in the main body of\nthe paper. These two sections are based exclusively on Suh (1990, 2001) and Long (1983- a, b), respectively.\nSEMDES is introduced in Section 4 with the help of an example derived from an Axiomatic Design case\nstudy. A discussion on the scope, limitations and future work on SEMDES is presented in section 5. Finally\nconclusions are drawn in section 6.\n2. Axiomatic design\nThe underlying hypothesis of the Axiomatic Design (AD) theory (Suh, 1990 and 2001) is that there exist\nfundamental principles that govern good design practice. The main distinguishable components of AD are\ndomains, hierarchies, and design axioms. The foundation axioms are:\nAxiom 1. Maintain the independence of the functional requirements*.\nAxiom 2. Minimise the information content of the design.\nAccording to the AD theory, the design process takes place in four domains (figure1): Customer, Functional,\nPhysical and Process. Through a series of iterations, the design process converts customer\u2019s needs (CNs) into\nFunctional Requirements (FRs) and constraints (Cs), which in turn are mapped to Design Parameters (DPs).\nDPs determine (but also can be affected by) the manufacturing or Process Variables (PVs). The\ndecomposition process starts with the decomposition of the overall functional requirement. Before\ndecomposing a FR at a particular hierarchical level in the functional domain, the corresponding DP must be\ndetermined for the same hierarchical level in the physical domain. This iterative process is called zigzagging\n(See also Tate,1999, for a more thorough description of the decomposition problem).\nZigzagging also involves the other domains since manufacturing considerations may constrain design\ndecisions, while too \u201ctight\u201d requirements could virtually prohibit the discovery of feasible design solutions.\nFigure 1. Decomposition by zigzagging.\n* It appears that systems engineers realised this independently, while learning from some bad designs in the automotive industry (see\nStevens, Myers, and Constantine, 1974, p.139).\nCustomer Domain Functional Domain Process Domain\nFRCN DP PV\nPhysical Domain\nAt each level of the design hierarchy, the relations between the FRs and the DPs can be represented in an\nequation of the form:\nFR = [A]DP (1)\nwhere each element of the design matrix [A] can be expressed as:\nAij = \uf0b6FRi\/\uf0b6DPj , ( i = 1,\u2026, m and j = 1,\u2026, n) (2)\nEquation (1) is called the design equation and can be interpreted as \u201cchoosing the right set of DPs to satisfy\ngiven FRs\u201d. Each element Aij is represented as a partial derivative to indicate dependency of a FRi on a DPj.\nFor simplicity the value of an element Aij can be expressed as 0 (i.e. the functional requirement does not\ndepend on the particular design parameter), or otherwise X. Depending on the type of the resulting design\nmatrix [A], three types of designs exist: uncoupled, decoupled and coupled (figure 2).\nFigure 2. Examples of design types. Matrix entries marked with X mean Aij \u2260 0\nUncoupled design occurs when each FR is satisfied by exactly one DP. The resulting matrix is diagonal and\nthe design equation has an exact solution, i.e., Axiom 1 is satisfied. When the design matrix contains non-zero\nentries on the main diagonal and some elements below it, the resulting design is decoupled. This means that a\nsequence exists, where by adjusting DPs in a certain order, the FRs can be satisfied. The design matrix of a\ncoupled design contains mostly non-zero elements and thus the FRs cannot be satisfied independently. A\ncoupled design can be decoupled, for example, by adding components to carry out specific functions,\nhowever, this comes at a price.\nThe complexity of the problem increases tremendously when the manufacturing process factors are being\nconsidered simultaneously with the design ones. By analogy to equation (1), the design parameters can be\nconsidered as requirements of the manufacturing process. Thus the design equation of the manufacturing\nprocess is:\nDP = [B]PV (3)\n=\n=\n= Uncoupled Design,\nAij \u2260 0 for i = j. \nDecoupled Design,\nAij \u2260 0 for i = j and some i > j. \nCoupled Design,\nAij \u2260 0 for i = j,  i > j and some i < j. \nFR\nFR\nFRn\nX\nX\nX\nDP\nDP\nDPn\nFR\nFR\nFRn\nX\nX X\nX X\nDP\nDP\nDPn\nFR\nFR\nFRn\n1\n2\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n0 0\n0\n0\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\uf04d \uf04d \uf04d \uf04f \uf04d \uf04d\n\uf04d \uf04d \uf04d \uf04f \uf04d \uf04d\n\uf04d\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\nX X\nX X X\nX X X\nDP\nDP\nDPn\n0 1\n2\n...\n...\n...\n\uf04d \uf04d \uf04f \uf04d \uf04d\nThe two matrix equations can be combined into a single relation by substituting equation (3) into equation (1),\nthus linking the requirements with the manufacturing process:\nFR = [A][B]PV = [C]PV (4)\nThe multiplication order reflects the chronological order of the design and manufacturing processes. In theory,\nif the resulting matrix [C] is diagonal, then the design is uncoupled and all the design and manufacturing\nparameters satisfy the functional requirements. This does not happen very often in practice and either [A], i.e.\nthe design, or [B], i.e., the manufacturing process has to be modified during the product development process.\n3. Covariance structural models\nCovariance Structural Models is arguably the broadest term encompassing a number of methods which aim to\nexplain the relationships among a set of observed variables in terms of a generally smaller number of\nunobserved and\/or other observed variables. Its origins can be traced back to the early years of research in\ngenetics (see for example Wright (1920), quoted in Loehlin (1998). In this section two specific models are\noutlined, the Confirmatory Model and the Structural Equation Model. The combination of these models forms\nthe SEMDES method which is proposed in Section 4. The notation and the description of the Confirmatory\nand the Structure Equation Models in this section follow exclusively that of Long (1983-a, b) for consistency.\nLoehlin (1998) provides a very good introduction to the subject.\n3.2 The confirmatory model\nThe confirmatory model is used predominantly in the behavioural sciences. In this model some variables of\ninterest cannot be directly observed, for example, psychological disorders. These unobserved variables are\nreferred to as latent variables or common factors. While latent variables cannot be directly observed,\ninformation about them can be obtained indirectly by noting their effect on observed variables (e.g. psycho-\nphysiological symptoms). In this way one takes a hypothesised structure and tries to find out how well it\naccounts for the observed relationships in the data. Figure 3 illustrates a Confirmatory model.\n\uf06612 = \uf06621\n\uf07124 = \uf07142\uf07113 = \uf07131\n\uf06c42\uf06c32\n\uf06c21\uf06c11\n\uf0781\nx1\n\uf0782\n\uf064\nx2 x3 x4\n\uf064 \uf064 \uf064\nNotation:\nx- observed variable\n\uf078- common factor (latent variable)\n\uf06c -loading which indicates how change\nin a common factor affects an\nobserved variable\n\uf064- unique factor (residual)\n\uf066- covariance (correlation) between\ntwo common factors\n\uf071 - covariance (correlation) between\ntwo unique factors (residuals)\nFigure 3. A confirmatory factor model.\nThe latent variables \uf078 are represented by circles while the observed variables x are indicated by squares. Each\nlatent variable in this particular model is measured by two observed variables. In the terminology of factor\nanalysis it is said that x1 and x2 load on \uf0781, and x3 and x4 load on \uf0782. The loadings are indicated by the straight\narrows connecting the latent and the observed variables. The relationships among the observed and latent\nvariables can be expressed in a matrix from:\nx = \uf04c\uf078+ \uf064 (5)\nwhere x is (q \uf0b4 1) vector of observed variables; \uf078 is a (s \uf0b4 1) vector of latent variables; \uf04c is a (q \uf0b4 s) matrix of\nfactor loadings relating the observed to the latent variables; and \uf064 is a (q \uf0b4 1) vector of residual or unique\nfactors. The above equation, called also the factor equation, can be thought of as the regression with zero\nintercept of observed variables on unobserved (latent) variables\u2020. The loadings \uf06c correspond to slope\ncoefficients, that is, a unit change in the latent variable results in an expected change of \uf06c units in the\nobserved variable. For example (see also figure 3), the factor equation, x2 = \uf06c21\uf0781 + \uf0642, indicates that a unit\nincrease of \uf0781 results in an expected increase of \uf06c21 units in x2. In this equation, \uf0642 can be thought of as an error\nterm indicating that \uf0781 does not perfectly predict x2. Both the observed and latent variables are assumed to be\nmeasured as deviations from their means. Thus, the expected value of each vector is a vector containing\nzeroes: E(x) = 0; E(\uf078) = 0; and E(\uf064) = 0. Since this assumption involves only a change in origin of the\ndistribution, it does not affect the covariances among the variables. A practical advantage of assuming zero\nmeans is that the covariances are equivalent to expectations of the product of variables with zero means. This\nallows the population covariance matrix \uf053 of the observed variables to be obtained by multiplying the matrix\nof the observed variables x by its transpose x\uf0a2 and taking expectation. This is accomplished by multiplying\nequation (5) by its transpose and taking expectations:\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf0a2\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\uf0a2\uf03d \u03b4\u039b\u03be\u03b4\u039b\u03bexx\u03a3 EE\nSince the transpose of a sum of matrices is equal to the sum of the transpose of the matrices, and the transpose\nof a product of matrices is the product of the transposes in reverse order, it follows that:\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\u03b4\u039b\u03be\u03b4\u039b\u03be\u03a3 \uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf02b\uf03d E\nUsing the distributive property of matrices and taking expectations:\n\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d\u03b4\u03b4\u039b\u03be\u03b4\u03b4\u039b\u03be\u039b\u03be\u039b\u03be\n\u03b4\u03b4\u039b\u03be\u03b4\u03b4\u039b\u03be\u039b\u03be\u039b\u03be\u03a3\n\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf03d\n\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf03d\nEEEE\nE\nThe parameter matrix \uf04c does not contain random variables, since the population values of the parameters are\nconstant (even if unknown). This allows us to write:\n\uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d\u03b4\u03b4\u039b\u03be\u03b4\u03b4\u03be\u039b\u039b\u03be\u03be\u039b\u03a3 \uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf03d EEEE\nFinally, since \uf05b \uf05d\uf078\uf0a2\uf078E is defined as \uf046, E[\uf064\uf064\uf0a2] is defined as \uf051, and \uf064 and \uf078 are assumed to be uncorrelated, the\nabove equation can be simplified to:\n\u2020 It should be noted, however, that in the regression analysis both the dependent and the independent variables are observed.\n\u0398\u039b\u039b\u03a6\u03a3 \uf02b\uf0a2\uf03d (6)\nEquation (6) is referred to as the covariance equation.\nThe (i,j)th element of \uf053, \uf073ij, is the population value of the covariance between xi and xj, \uf073ij = E(xi, xj). \uf053 is a (q\n\uf0b4 q) symmetric matrix, since cov(xi, xj ) = cov(xj, xi). The main diagonal contains variances, since cov(xi, xi ) =\nvar(xi). If the observed variables were standardised to have a variance of one, E(xi, xj) would be the correlation\nbetween xi and xj, and \uf053 would be the population correlation matrix.\nSimilarly the covariances (or correlations) among the latent variables are contained in \uf046, an (s \uf0b4 s) symmetric\nmatrix. The covariances (correlations) among the residuals are contained in the population matrix, \uf051, a (q \uf0b4 q)\nsymmetric matrix. The above assumptions and results are summarised in table 1.\nTable 1.

Variables are measured from their means: \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 .0)(;0 \uf03d\uf03d\uf03d \u03b4x\u03be EEE\nb. The number of observed variables is greater than the number of common factors; i.e., q>s.\nc. Common factors and unique factors are uncorrelated: \uf028 \uf029 0\uf03d\uf0a2\u03b4\u03beE or \uf028 \uf029 .0\uf03d\uf0a2\u03be\u03b4E\nTwo important issues are associated with solving the covariance equation, identification and estimation.\nIdentification precedes estimation and is concerned with whether the covariance equation has unique solution,\nthat is, whether the parameters of the model are uniquely determined. The left side of the covariance equation\ncontains q(q + 1)\/2 distinct variances and covariances among the observed variables\u2021. The right side of the\nequation contains q\uf0b4s possible loadings from \uf04c, s(s + 1)\/2 independent variances and covariances among the\n\uf078\u2019s; and q(q + 1)\/2 independent variances and covariances among the \uf064\u2019s. Thus, the covariance equation\ndecomposes the q(q + 1)\/2 distinct elements of \uf053 into [qs + s(s + 1)\/2 + q(q + 1)\/2] unknown independent\nparameters from the matrices \uf04c, \uf046, and \uf051. It follows that a confirmatory model is unidentified unless at least\n[qs + s(s + 1)\/2] constraints are imposed. Hence a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for identification is\nthat the number of independent, unconstraint parameters in the model must be less than or equal to q(q + 1)\/2.\n\u2021 Recall that \uf053 is a (q \uf0b4 q) symmetric matrix. Of the total of q2 elements in \uf053, the q diagonal elements are variances (or unities if we\nare dealing with correlations, i.e. with standardised data). Half of the remaining q2 \u2013 q elements are redundant since the covariance\n(correlation) matrix \uf053 is symmetric. Thus there are q + (q2 \u2013 q)\/2 = q(q + 1)\/2 unique elements in \uf053.\nEstimation assumes that the model is identified. It uses sample data to construct the sample matrix of\ncovariances, S, to estimate the parameters in \uf04c, \uf046, and \uf051.\nThis is done by obtaining an estimate of the covariance matrix through the covariance equation\n\uf051\uf02b\uf04c\uf0a2\uf046\uf04c\uf03d\uf053 \u02c6\u02c6\u02c6 , where the ^ indicates that the matrices contain estimates of the parameters. These estimates\nmust satisfy the constraints imposed on the model. Thus estimation involves finding values of \uf04c\u02c6 , \uf046\u02c6 , and\n\uf051\u02c6 that generate an estimated covariance matrix \uf053\u02c6 that is as close as possible to the sample covariance matrix\nS.\nA function which measures how close is a given \uf053\u02c6 to the sample covariance matrix S is called a fitting\nfunction. Three fitting functions are commonly used in confirmatory factor analysis, which correspond to the\nmethods of Unweighted Least Squares (ULS), Generalised Least Squares (GLS), and Maximum Likelihood\n(ML).\nThe methods and criteria for identification and estimation are of great importance, but fall beyond the scope\nof this paper. There are several commercial model fitting programs which can help the researcher or the\npractitioner with identification and estimation (see for example Loehlin, 1998). One of these programs,\nLISREL, is used in the example presented in Section 4.\n3.2 The structural equation model\nStructural Equation Modelling is a fundamental tool used extensively in econometrics. A Structural Equation\nModel (SEM) specifies the causal relationship among a set of variables. SEM is illustrated in figure 4 and is\nsummarised in table 2. Unlike confirmatory factor analysis, all variables in SEM are observed and\nmeasurable. Those variables that are to be explained by the model are called endogenous variables.\nEndogenous variables are causally dependant on other endogenous variables and\/or what are called exogenous\nvariables. Exogenous variables are determined outside the model.\nFigure 4. A structural equation model.\nLet \uf068 be a (r \uf0b4 1) vector of endogenous variables and let \uf078 be a (s \uf0b4 1) vector of exogenous variables (see\nFigure 4). In SEM it is assumed that the variables are related by a system of linear structural equations:\n\uf068= \uf042\uf068 + \uf047\uf078 + \uf07a (7)\n\uf06212\n\uf06711 \uf06712 \uf06722 \uf06723\n\uf07a1\n\uf07a2\n\uf06623\uf06612\n\uf06221\n\uf06613\n\uf0781 \uf0782 \uf0783\n\uf0681 \uf0682\nNotation:\n\uf078- exogenous variable\n\uf068- endogenous variable\n\uf067 - coefficient relating an exogenous\nvariable with an endogenous\nvariable\n\uf066 - covariance (correlation) between\ntwo exogenous variables\n\uf062 - coefficient relating two endogenous\nvariables to one another\n\uf07a- error in measurement of \uf068\nwhere \uf042 is a (r \uf0b4 r) matrix of coefficients relating the endogenous variables to one another; \uf047 is (s \uf0b4 s) matrix\nof coefficients relating the exogenous variables to the endogenous variables; and is \uf07a a (r \uf0b4 1) vector of errors\nin equations, indicating that the endogenous variables are not perfectly predicted by the structural equations.\nRestricting the elements of \uf047 and \uf042 to equal zero indicates the absence of a causal relationship between the\nappropriate variables. For example fixing \uf067ij = 0 implies that the exogenous variable \uf078j does not have a causal\neffect on the endogenous variable \uf068i. Similarly fixing \uf062ij = 0, the endogenous variable \uf068i is assumed to be\nunaffected by \uf068j. The diagonal elements of \uf042 are assumed equal to zero, indicating that an endogenous\nvariable does not cause itself.\nSubtracting \uf042\uf068 from each side of equation (7) (resulting in \uf068- \uf042\uf068 = \uf047\uf078 + \uf07a) and defining \uf042\uf026\uf026 as (\uf049 - \uf042), were \uf049\nis the identity matrix, results in:\n\uf07a\uf02b\uf078\uf047\uf03d\uf068\uf042\uf026\uf026 , (8)\nwhich is the form more commonly found in the econometric literature (Long 1983-b). Equation (8) in turn can\nbe presented in what is known as the reduced from of the structural equation:\n\uf07a\uf042\uf02b\uf078\uf047\uf042\uf03d\uf068\n\uf02d\uf02d 11 \uf026\uf026\uf026\uf026 (9)\nIn this form the endogenous variables are represented as functions only of the exogenous variables and the\nerrors in equations.\nAs in the confirmatory model all variables in SEM are assumed to be measured as deviations from their\nmeans: E(\uf068) = E(\uf07a) = 0 and E(\uf078) = 0. The errors in equations are measured from zero (i.e., E(\uf07ai) = 0) and are\nassumed to be uncorrelated with the exogenous variables, that is, E(\uf078\uf07a\uf0a2) = 0 and E(\uf07a\uf078\uf0a2) = 0.\nTable 2.

The values of \uf079 are generally\nunknown, although off-diagonal elements can be restricted to zero to indicate that errors in equations are\nuncorrelated across two equations.\nAs in the confirmatory factor model discussed in the previous subsection, a covariance equation needs to be\nconstructed in order to link the covariances of the observable variables with the unknown structural\nparameters and covariances. In this case the structural parameters are contained in \uf042 and \uf047, and the unknown\ncovariances in \uf046 and \uf079.\nThe covariances among the observable variables can be stacked in a (r+s \uf0b4 r+s) covariance matrix:\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf078\uf068\uf078\n\uf078\uf068\uf068\n\uf03d\uf053\n)cov(),cov(\n),cov()cov(\n(10)\nThe covariance equation can be derived\u00a7 from equation (10) by substituting cov(\uf068) with E(\uf068\uf068\uf0a2), where \uf068 is\nsubstituted with the right-hand side of the structural equation (9):\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf046\uf042\uf0a2\uf047\uf0a2\uf046\n\uf046\uf047\uf042\uf042\uf0a2\uf059\uf02b\uf047\uf0a2\uf046\uf047\uf042\n\uf03d\uf053\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n1\n111 )(\n\uf026\uf026\n\uf026\uf026\uf026\uf026\uf026\uf026\n(11)\nIn practice \uf053 is unknown, therefore sample data from field studies must be obtained in order to construct the\nsample matrix S. The process of estimation involves finding values for \uf042, \uf047, \uf046, and \uf079 that produce a\ncovariance matrix according to the covariance Equation (11) which is as close as possible to the observed\n(sample) covariance matrix S. The criteria for model identification as well as the estimation methods are\nbeyond the scope of this brief introduction. For complex models identification and estimation are performed\nwith the help of computer programs such as LISREL (see for example Long 1983-b or Loehlin 1998).\n4. SEMDES\nThe proposed combined application of the Confirmatory Factor Model and the structural component of the\nCovariance Structure Model form a procedure named, SEMDES - Structure Equation Models for the Design\nof Engineering Systems. SEMDES is introduced by way of an example which has been adapted from a case\nstudy by Suh (1990). The choice of the case study has been influenced by a number of considerations such as\nthe requirement to be self contained and simple enough so that at least the matrix calculations are reproducible\nby hand. This would make SEMDES easier to understand and compare with the AD approach. The case study\nwas augmented for the purposes of this research with an imaginary extension to illustrate modelling and\nsimulation of vague, non functional customer needs. The applicability of the example to other industries is\naddressed below.\n\u00a7 The detailed derivation is presented in Long (1983-b). It is conceptually similar to the derivation of equation (6).\n4.1 Case Study\nA shoe manufacturer decided to invest in injection moulding machines that can make foamed plastic shoe\nsoles. The first task facing the company was to determine the needs of the potential customers. The marketing\ndepartment interviewed a number of persons from a particular gender, age range, and income bracket. The\ninterviews revealed that the potential customers in that particular market segment were less fashion conscious\nand the majority preferred quality shoe wear**. The next problem was how to translate the customer need\n(CN) quality shoe (sole) into functional requirements (FR). The market researchers managed to extract a few\ncharacteristics of a \u2018quality shoe (sole)\u2019 from their initial interviews. It was decided to use a Confirmatory\nFactor model to check the hypothesis that characteristics such as flexibility, weight, and durability are the FRs\nwhich will satisfy the CN in this particular market segment.\nFigure 5. Confirmatory factor model suggested for the injection moulding machine example.\nAt this point a second interview with the customers was conducted to test the confirmatory model shown in\nFigure 5. It should be noted here that while desirable, the interviewees do need to be the same persons for the\ntwo interviews.\nThe collected data was standardised and the sample correlation matrix S constructed. In the suggested model,\nthe matrix of the latent variables \uf078 contains only one element, \uf07811 which is the single customer need, quality\nshoe (sole). For this reason the correlation matrix of the latent variables, \uf046, also contains only one element,\n** In this example only the sole is considered.\n0.880.79 0.57\nQuality\nShoe\n(sole)\nFlexibilityDurability Weight\n0.37 0.22\n0.68\nSample Correlation Matrix S\nFlexibility Weight Durability\nFlexibility 1.00\nWeight 0.50 1.00\nDurability 0.45 0.70 1.00\n\uf06611 = 1. The matrix of the observed variables x contains three elements, the three FRs. Similarly the matrix \uf04c\ncontaining the loadings of x on \uf078, has only three elements. It is assumed that the errors (the residual factors)\nare uncorrelated. It follows then that the matrix containing the covariances of the residual factors, \uf051 is\ndiagonal - the diagonal elements being the variances of the individual residual factors. With these assumptions\nit is easy to see that the model is identified. The covariance equation (6) of the model in this example can be\nrepresented as:\n\uf05b \uf05d\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02b\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n33\n22\n11\n312111\n31\n21\n11\n3231\n2321\n1312\n00\n00\n00\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\uf071\n\uf071\n\uf071\n\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\n\uf06c\n\uf06c\n\uf06c\n\uf073\uf073\n\uf073\uf073\n\uf073\uf073\nNote that in the above equation \uf073ij = \uf073ji since \uf053 is a symmetrical matrix.\nIn order to estimate the model, the above equation is solved by giving values to the parameters on the right\nhand side of the equation that would generate the predicted matrix, \uf053\u02c6 , on the left hand side. \uf053\u02c6 should be as\nclose as possible to the observed correlation matrix S in figure 5. This process was performed with the help of\nLISREL (Joreskog and Sorbom, 2001) which handles a large class of covariance structure models. LISREL\nchecked whether the model is identified, and after confirmation, indicated a nearly perfect fit. This was not a\nsurprise, given such a straightforward model. The estimated values of the loadings \uf06c1j and the errors in\nvariance \uf064j are shown in figure 5. (The estimations of LISREL can be reproduced by manually performing the\ncalculations at the right hand side of the above equation, assuming that \uf07111 = 0.37, \uf07122 = 0.22, and \uf07133 = 0.68.\nNote also that \uf06c1j2 + \uf064j = 1.)\nThe conclusion of the model fitting procedure is that, indeed, flexibility, weight, and durability are predicted\nby the latent variable \u2018quality shoe (sole)\u2019 since the model is identified, estimated and the loadings \uf04c turned\nout to be significant\u2020\u2020, that is, greater than 0.3. These findings justified that the observed variables be accepted\nas functional requirements of the new product:\nFR1 = Flexibility.\nFR2 = (Light) Weight.\nFR3 = Durability.\nIn general there may be more than one latent variable representing qualitative customer needs. In such cases\nthe structural part of the model specifies the relationships between the latent variables while the measurement\n(confirmatory) part specifies the relationships of the latent to the observed variables. Thus one latent variable\ncan be linked to one or more latent variables and to one or more observed variables. For example, it may be\nassumed in a model that latent variables such as quality, comfort and appeal are related, but nevertheless\ndistinct factors. In practice, the usual procedure is to solve the measurement and structural models\nsimultaneously, because in doing so, one brings to bear all information available (Loehlin, 1998, p. 92).\nThe next task of the engineering process was to find design parameters (DPs) which will satisfy the FRs. The\ndesign team decided that the core of the sole (figure 6) was to be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC) of uniform\ndensity, \uf072, for durability, light weight, and flexibility.\n\u2020\u2020 Standardised values above 0.3 are considered to be significant (see for example Child, 1990).\nFigure 6. Construction of the plastic shoe sole (adapted from Suh, 1990).\nThe outer skin was to be a solid PVC layer for good wear resistance (i.e. durability). A team of designers,\nmanufacturing and production engineers decided that the machine which will produce the sole will be based\non the injection moulding process, shown at the bottom of figure 6.\nThus for the DPs it was decided that:\nDP1 = Thickness of the foamed core, a.\nDP2 = Density of the foamed plastic core, \uf072.\nDP3 = Thickness of the solid plastic layer, b.\nSuh (1990) concluded in the original case study that such design is uncoupled, that is, the design matrix is\ndiagonal:\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n3\n2\n1\n00\n00\n00\n3\n2\n1\nDP\nDP\nDP\nX\nX\nX\nFR\nFR\nFR\nHowever, it is demonstrated in the next section, that this result may not hold if a possible correlation between\nthe FRs is accounted for.\nThe next step of the product development process was to search for process variables (PVs) which could yield\ndiagonal design matrix. In order to obtain uniform density, the incompressible plastic material needed to be\nuniformly distributed throughout the mould before being let to foam under uniform pressure. For this reason a\nconstruction of the mould was chosen which incorporated a moving half (figure 6). This would allow\ncontrolling the expansion of the volume at nearly constant pressure. On the other hand, the thickness, b, of the\nskin layer at the surface could be controlled by either cooling the mould surface or by varying the elapsed\nb\na\nFoamed\nplastic core\nof density \uf072\nInsole\nSolid skin\nlayer\nMovable half\nof the mold\nPlastic\nNarrow\nmould gap\nGap after\nexpansion\ntime before the mould expansion, since plastic could not expand at low temperatures even when blowing\nagents were present (Suh, 1990). Thus the following PVs were chosen:\nPV1 = Expansion rate of the mould, \uf065.\nPV2 = Injection velocity, V.\nPV3 = Temperature of the mould surface, T.\nThe DP-PV design equation is:\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\nT\nV\nXX\nXX\nX\nb\na \uf065\n\uf072\n0\n0\n00\nThe design matrix suggests a decoupled design of the manufacturing process. The matrix reveals that the\nexpansion rate, \uf065, affects both the foamed core thickness, a, and its density, \uf072. Similarly, the injection\nvelocity, V, controls for the core density, \uf072, and the thickness of the solid skin layer, b.\nThe Structure Equation Model (SEM) corresponding to the structure of the FR-DP design equation is shown\nin figure 7. The FRs are considered to be the exogenous variables, \uf078, since they were determined outside this\nmodel. The DPs are the endogenous variables, \uf068. A causal link between an FR and a DP is represented by a\nsolid arrow. The double headed curved arrows represent error correlations. These were fitted by the software\non the basis of the correlations among the FRs from the previous stage- the confirmatory model. The FR\ncorrelations are preserved (as constraints) in the sample correlation matrix- the highlighted region of the table\nin figure 7. The model fitting program LISREL was used again to identify and estimate the model. It is seen\nfrom figure 7 that each loading \uf06c is significant at 0.5.\nFigure 7. Structural Equation Model constructed for the injection moulding machine example.\nThe model fits reasonably well for sample sizes between 20 and 100. For example, for a sample size of 50 and\n9 degrees of freedom, the \u03c72 (chi-square) is 44.23 and the P-value is 0.0000. The P-value is the probability of\nobtaining a \u03c72 value larger than the value obtained, given that the model is correct. It is worth pointing out,\nhowever, that the \u03c72 is sensitive to sample size and to departure from multivariate normality of the observed\nvariables. Thus for a larger sample, the difference between the chi-square and the degrees of freedom would\nbe large, as in this example, suggesting that further inspection is needed of fitted residuals , the standardised\nresiduals and modification indices. Often these quantities will suggest ways to relax the model by introducing\nmore parameters (Joreskog and Sorbom, 2001). Indeed, LISREL suggested that in order to reduce the Chi-\nsquare, four paths are introduced between the exogenous and endogenous variables. The software estimated\nthe following values (weights):\nWeight to Foam thickness - 0.33;\nWeight to Thickness of solid plastic layer - 0.69\nFlexibility to Density of foamed plastic core - 0.33;\nDurability to Density of foamed plastic core - 0.69;\nSample Correlation Matrix S\nFR DP\nFlexibility Weight Durability Foam_a Density_\uf072 Solid_b\nFlexibility 1.00\nWeight 0.50 1.00\nDurability 0.45 0.70 1.00\nFoam_a 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00\nDensity_\uf072 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00\nSolid_b 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00\n1.001.001.00\n0.700.50\n0.45\n0.500.500.50\nDensity_\uf072\nDurabilityWeightFlexibility\nSolid_bFoam_a\n1.001.001.00\nFrom axiomatic design point of view this result is significant as it indicates that, given a certain correlation\nbetween the functional requirements, a model with a better fit may not necessarily be the envisaged uncoupled\ndesign.\n4.2 The SEMDES procedure\nThe approach described above could be adapted to other sectors such as the defence and aerospace where\ncertain customer needs such as \u2018intensity\u2019, \u2018impact\u2019, etc., are subjective and difficult to quantify. The same\napplies to the transport, construction as well as the consumer industries. Taking the automotive industry as an\nexample (see also Sobek II et al 1998 and Nevins and Winner 1999), comfort may mean different things to\ndifferent age, gender and income groups. It can be mapped to technical requirements such as vibrations and\ndeflections transmitted to the passengers. These, in turn can be mapped to characteristics such as the constants\nof the seat springs, the stiffness of the suspension, the acceleration limits and so forth. While QFD tools can\nbe used for this type of mapping, it is the application of the latent variable model which should give the\ndesigner reasonable confidence that he\/she has chosen the right mapping.\nFollowing the examples above, the SEMDES procedure is summarised in figure 8 and generalised as follows:\nStep 1: Perform customer elicitation studies, for example, structured interviews. Use these as inputs to\nexploratory factor analysis and conjoint analysis to extract and prioritise the customer needs\n(CN).\n\/* Comment: CNs can be quite vague and difficult to quantify and therefore are modelled as latent variables. *\/\nStep 2: Formulate a hypothesis on the potential functional requirements (FR) which satisfy the CNs \u2013\nbuild the Confirmatory model part of SEMDES. Ensure that the model is identified.\nStep 3: Perform a second set of interviews with (a representative sample of) customers in order to obtain\nthe covariance matrix of the observable variables - the FRs.\nStep 4: Evaluate the hypothesis by performing (goodness of fit) estimation of the model.\nStep 5: If the model fits, then:\naccept the FRs as representative of the customer need, store the correlation coefficients between\nthe FRs;\nelse: go to Step 2.\nStep 6: Map the FRs as identified in Step 5 to design parameters (DP).\nStep 7: Translate the FR-DP mapping into the Structure Equation Model part of SEMDES. Keep the\ncorrelation coefficients from Step 5 as constraints and also consider possible causal relationships\nbetween the DPs, which may need to be incorporated into the SEM.\nStep 8: Find the best model fit in order to obtain the values of the design matrix entries (\uf067) and the casual\nlinks (\uf062), if any, between the DPs.\nStep 9: The best fit model may differ from the one devised by the application of the design equation in\nStep 6. Then it will be up to the designer to decide if the model represents a good compromise in\nterms of functionality (Axiom 1), weight and other cost-benefit factors (see for example Guenov\n2002). If the designer is not convinced, then the process should be repeated from Step 6 if only\nDPs are modified or from Step 2 if FRs are added and\/or replaced.\nFigure 8.

Such\ncorrelations usually reflect practical experience gained from development of similar products over a long\nperiod of time. For example, empirical curves or equations may link aspect ratio, wing loading, etc., with\nempty weight fractions in aircraft design (Raymer, 1992).\nFigure 9. A hypothetical Structural Equation model of the injection moulding machine example, which takes into account\ncorrelations between FRs and DPs.\nIn the model presented in figure 7 all FRs and DPs are uncorrelated (the zero entries in S). The question is\nwhether and how the FR-DP structure will change as a result of such correlation combined with the FRs\ncorrelation. It should be emphasised at this point that causality and correlation are two distinct issues, which if\noverlooked can lead to a significant misinterpretation of the model. Thus if one assumes that if a FR \u201ccauses\u201d\na DP they should be correlated, otherwise they should be uncorrelated, may lead to wrong conclusions. Due to\nthe fact that the exogenous variables can be correlated, then controlling for one such variable, a strong\n(causal) relationship elsewhere in the model can vanish and a zero relationship can become strong\u2021\u2021. The\nproblem is illustrated in figure 9, where it is assumed that certain FRs are correlated with certain DPs, but are\n\u2021\u2021 This is also known as specification error (Kenny, 1979).\nSample Correlation Matrix S\nFR DP\nFlexibility Weight Durability Foam_a Density_\uf072 Solid_b\nFlexibility 1.00\nWeight 0.50 1.00\nDurability 0.45 0.70 1.00\nFoam_a 0.00 0.15 0.10 1.00\nDensity_\uf072 0.00 0.00 0.10 0.00 1.00\nSolid_b 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00\n1.001.001.00\n0.700.50\n0.45\n0.500.500.00\nDensity_\uf072\nDurabilityWeightFlexibility\nSolid_bFoam_a\n1.001.001.00\nnot causally linked. The correlation coefficients are highlighted in the correlation matrix and are also\nrepresented by double headed dashed-line arrows in the path model. After running the model it turns out that\n\uf06c11 \uf0bb 0. (This means that varying the foam thickness within the tolerance will not have a strong effect on the\nflexibility of the sole.) While this phenomenon has been known to the SEM theorists (Kenny 1979, pp. 62-63)\nit will require further research to understand the interplay of causality and correlation in engineering design.\nThis extends also to the modelling of constraints involving the DPs, which may require the introduction of\ncausal links (\uf062ij in figure 4; see also next section and figure 10) between the endogenous variables (the DPs).\nFor example, the power of one mechanism may affect the performance of another one, due to, say\nelectromagnetic interference even though the design may be uncoupled. Such effects have been modelled as\nsupplemental constraints in other systems design tools such as SLATE (Talbott et al 1994).\n5.2 SEMDES and Axiomatic Design\nAnother question that arises from the above examples is how covariance structure models, SEM in particular,\nrelate to Axiomatic Design (AD). In the case of SEM, the loadings (\uf06cij) can be considered partial regression\ncoefficients (known also as beta weights) because of the condition that the errors are uncorrelated with the\nexogenous variables, that is, E(\uf078\uf07a\uf0a2) = 0 and E(\uf07a\uf078\uf0a2) = 0 (Kenny 1979). This suggests that in the linear case the\ndesign equation matrix can be expressed by a SEM. The latter has potentially a stronger descriptive power\ncompared to the design equation since it allows also for representing causal links between the endogenous\nvariables (the DPs in Axiomatic Design). The latter are illustrated by the model fragment shown in figure10.\nWing dihedral is the angle of the wing with respect to the horizontal. The dihedral tends to roll the aircraft\nlevel whenever it is banked. It is also known that wing sweep, which is used primarily to reduce the adverse\neffects (shocks) of transonic and supersonic flow, causes an effective dihedral which adds to any geometric\ndihedral. As a rough approximation, 10 deg of sweep provides about 1 deg of effective dihedral (see for\nexample, Rymer (1992)). This assumption is modelled as a constraint (\uf06223 = 0.1) in the model in figure 9. In\nthis example the effective dihedral is a derived design parameter which adds to the difficulty in selecting the\ngeometric dihedral.\nThe example also shows that the number of Functional Requirements (FR) and Design Parameters (DPs) may\ndiffer while Axiomatic Design assumes a one-to-one mapping between FRs and DPs, i.e., square design\nmatrixes. While desirable, this is not always possible (see also Guenov and Barker 2005).\nThe linearity assumption in SEMDES is founded on previous research. For example, Fray et all (2000) argue\nthat: \u201c\u2026assumption of nearly linear behaviour within the design range can safely be made for most products,\nbecause the design range is typically very small given the tight tolerances on performance of modern\nsystems\u00a7\u00a7\u201d. The authors quote a survey of literature on parametric error models in machine tools and also a\ncase study on electronics packaging in support of their argument.\n\u00a7\u00a7 A prior knowledge of the range is important. For example, a relatively small change of speed, from subsonic to transonic, can\ncause a significant increase of drag due to the formation of shocks.\nFigure 10. Effective dihedral \u2013 an example of a derived design parameter.\nNonlinearity in SEM can be handled through variable transformation. For example single bend\ntransformations (i.e. functions whose curves have a single bend) such as logarithm, square root and reciprocal\nare more appropriate for variables that have a lower limit of zero and no upper limit. Two bend\ntransformations such as arcsin are useful for variables which have lower and upper limit (Kenny, 1979).\nCurrent versions of tools such as LISREL can handle a number of multilevel, non-linear models. Exploration\nof non-linearity forms a part of the future work on SEMDES.\n5.3 SEMDES and quality engineering\nAs part of the covariance structure methods SEMDES shares a conceptual similarity with the Taguchi\nmethods. The Taguchi methods use design of experiments which is based on the analysis of variance,\nANOVA. The latter has been recognised as a special case of multiple regression (Kenny 1979). Kenny also\noutlined the advantages of multiple regression over ANOVA. As it was noted above, SEM can be classed as a\nmultiple regression model, given the E(\uf078\uf07a\uf0a2) = 0 and E(\uf07a\uf078\uf0a2) = 0 conditions.\n\uf06212\n\uf06223 = 0.1\n\uf06711\n\uf06713\nDihedral Sweep\nRange\nEffective Dihedral\nFigure 11. SEMDES represented in a matrix form. (Refer also to table 1 and table 2 for the names and notation of the matrices. The\nmatrix containing the correlations of the residuals, \uf059, is not shown for simplicity.)\nIt is perhaps easier to demonstrate the richness of SEMDES and its apparent similarity to QFD in the pictorial\nrepresentation shown in figure 11. Some of the constituent matrices such as COV(\uf068) and \uf04c, appear, albeit\nless formally in the House of Quality as the relationships matrix and the technical correlations matrix,\nrespectively (Houser and Clausing 1988 and Cohen 1995), while others (\uf047) represent the Axiomatic Design\nmatrix. Matrix B is also known as the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) or Design Dependency Matrix. The\nterm DSM is used here in relation only to design parameters. An extensive review of the classification and\ncapabilities of DSM is given by Browning (2001).\nUnlike QFD, SEMDES does not deal with planning and technical targets. For example, metrics in the QFD\nPlanning Matrix, such as the Importance to the Customer and its multiplier, the Improvement Ratio can serve\nas a guide to which parameters should be varied and by how much in the SEMDES model. In this respect\nSEMDES is complementary to QFD and for this reason would be applicaple to evolutionary designs.\nHowever, in contrast to the general description of QFD (including Cohen\u2019s one) this work has shown that\nboth the technical requirements, or Substitute Quality Characteristics as they are known in QFD terminology\nand the design parameters can co-vary. The latter also can have direct (causal) effect on each other.\n5.4 SEMDES and marketing\nThe confirmatory factor analysis part of SEMDES can either confirm or reject a customer need hypothesis,\nbut it does not uniquely determine the number of variables which describe the functional requirements\nmapping. In the shoe example, a hypothesis was confirmed that Flexibility, Weight and Durability describe\nDP\ncovariance\nmatrix \u2013\nCOV(\uf068)\nCN covariance matrix -\n\uf046, in the confirmatory\nmodel\n(generally unknown)\nDirect FR - DP effects\n(\u2018Design Matrix\u2019) - \uf047\nDesign ParametersFunctional Requirements\nFR covariance matrix \u2013 \uf053 (S) in the\nconfirmatory model, or \uf046 in the\nstructural model\nD\nes\nig\nn\nPa\nra\nm\net\ner\ns\nFunctional Requirements\nC\nus\nto\nm\ner\nN\nee\nds\nDirect CN - FR effects - \uf04c\nDirect effects among DP - B\n(Parameter DSM)\nwell the customer need (Quality). In fact, a model including characteristics such as Water Resistance,\nSoftness, etc., as additional requirements, could have represented even a better mapping of the customer need.\nIn this respect fitting a particular latent variable model does not mean that it is a unique description of the\ncustomer need. The determination of the number and importance of the customer needs is an issue which\ninvolves subjectivity (Step 1 of the SEMDES Procedure). Experience, intuition and qualitative research are\nneeded to develop the list of key product attributes. There are a number of marketing techniques which utilise\na combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. These can be traced back to methods such as the Q-\nmethodology (Stephenson 1953; see also McKeown and Thomas 1988), and (exploratory) factor analysis\n(Thurstone 1947; see also Child 1990). These methods have evolved in recent years to combine conversation\nfragments, writings, pictures and (video) images to extract common factors. For example, the ZMET method\n(Zaltzman and Higie, 1993) uses images and metaphors to build a consensus map- a graph diagram for\nrepresenting and understanding the voice of the customer. A less formal method is Concept Engineering\n(1998) associated with the Language Processing Method (LPM 1997) which shares conceptual similarity with\nthe Original KJ method (Kawakita 1975), better known for its affinity maps.\nAfter the attributes (customer needs) have been identified a decision has to be made on the number and\nimportance of these attributes and their combinations. One of the relatively mature techniques currently\napplied in marketing is Conjoint Analysis (see for example Louviere 1988; Wittink and Bergestuen 2001).\nDepending on the type of conjoint survey conducted, different statistical methods are used to translate\nrespondents\u2019 answers into importance values or utilities. These reveal the underlying value which the\ncustomer consciously or subconsciously place on each attribute and on combinations of attributes. One of\nthose techniques is similar to what engineers may recognise as factorial experiments (see for example\nMontgomery, 2001). Regardless of the method used, it is critical to have a carefully thought out list of\nattributes. Too many attributes can greatly increase the burden on respondents while too few attributes can\nseverely reduce the predictive power of a model because key pieces of information would be missing. One\nlimitation of the conjoint models is the assumption that all respondents (customers) are equally well informed\nabout the products and product attributes, which may not be the case in practice, due to advertising,\nmarketing, distribution and other reasons. In such cases adjustments have to be made to account for bias.\n5.5 Summary of SEMDES limitations\nAs a qualitative process SEMDES can help the practicing designers understand the decomposition and\nmapping of customer needs onto technical requirements and subsequently mapping of the latter onto design\nparameters. However, as an analytical procedure it can be applicable mainly to evolutionary design. This is\nbecause the need for models and computational processes existing prior to the application of SEMDES. For\nexample, the early conceptual design phase of complex engineering systems such as aircraft requires the\napplication of hundreds of low fidelity empirical models and thousands of variables representing design\nparameters and performance constraints associated with the technical requirements. The models are coupled\nthrough shared variables. Obtaining values for the outputs given input variables specified by the designer\nrequires the employment of iterative and optimisation methods in order to dynamically assemble a\ncomputational process (see for example Guenov et al. 2006). Such a computational process is a prerequisite\nfor obtaining the sample matrix S in the structural equation part of SEMDES.\nAnother limitation is that the sampling of the input parameters needs to be performed in a limited range in\norder to ensure the linearity of the covariance structural model.\nLast, but not least, some caution must be exercised when applying covariance structure models.\nIf the (latent) variables are not standardised, their scale must be established. This is due to the indeterminacy\nbetween the variance of a latent variable and the loadings of the observed variables on that factor (Long\n1983a). This makes it impossible to distinguish between the case of a latent variable with a large variance and\nsmall loadings on it, and the case of small variance and large loadings from the observed variables on the\nlatent variable. It is also very important to keep in mind that a complex design model may not be identified.\nThis means that an infinite number of models may fit the covariance equation. In relation to engineering\ndesign this may not be fatal, since any feasible design, that is, a design which satisfies the FRs and constraints\nis acceptable. However, unidentified models are not acceptable when determining functional requirements\nfrom customer needs (i.e. the confirmatory factor analysis).\n6. Conclusions\nAs a tool for design and analysis, SEMDES is intended to help with the understanding and specification of the\nrelationships between customer needs, technical requirements and design parameters. It is based on a\ncombination of a confirmatory factor model and a structure equation model. This work has demonstrated for\nthe first time that these models can be applied together to engineering design.\nSEMDES bridges an important gap between engineering design and marketing, as it incorporates the\ndefinition and the seamless decomposition of customer needs to functional requirements and to design\nparameters. It will be particularly useful in practice for simulation of variability of customer needs and\nrequirements in order to see their effect on the evolving design.\nIt was also shown that SEMDES is a richer model compared to the (axiomatic) design equation and\ncomplementary to the House of Quality (QFD) in that it allows for the introduction of correlation between the\nfunctional requirements (FRs), between the FRs and the design parameters (DPs), as well as correlation and\ncausal relations between the DPs . However, more research is needed to achieve a better understanding of the\ninterplay between correlation and causality in engineering systems design, as well as any non-linear effects of\nthe latent and measured variables.
