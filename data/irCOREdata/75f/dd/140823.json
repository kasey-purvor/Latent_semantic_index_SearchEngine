A\nfull model run of several hours has been replaced by a metamodel version which takes a few seconds,\nand provides the user with an immediate visual output and with the ability to examine easily which\nfactors have the greatest effect. The Regional Impact Simulator combines a model of agricultural\nland use choices linked with models of urban growth, flooding risk, water quality and consequences\nfor wildlife to estimate plausible futures of agricultural land on a timescale of 20-50 years. The model\nexamines the East Anglian and North West regions of the United Kingdom at a grid resolution of 5 x\n5km, and for each scenario estimates the most likely cropping and its profitability at each location,\nand classifies land use as arable, intensive or extensive grassland or abandoned. From a modelling\nviewpoint the metamodel approach enables iteration. It is thus possible to determine how product\nprices change so that production meets demand. The results of the study show that in East Anglia\ncropping remains quite stable over a wide range of scenarios, though grassland is eliminated in\nscenarios with the 2050s High climate scenario \u2013 almost certainly due to the low yield in the drier\nconditions. In the North West there is a very much greater range of outcomes, though all scenarios\nsuggest a reduction in grassland with the greatest in the 2050s High climate scenario combined with\nthe \u201cRegional Stewardship\u201d (environmental) socio-economic scenario. The effects of the predicted\nchanges in land use on plant species showed suitability for species to vary greatly, particularly\nbetween the socio-economic scenarios, due to detrimental effects from increases in nitrogen\nfertilisation. A complete simulation with the Regional Impact Simulator takes around 20 seconds\n(computer-dependent), which users who responded felt was adequate or better than adequate. The\nmain areas for future improvement, such as the speed of the system, user interaction and the accuracy\nand detail of the modelling, are considered.\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture constitutes 8.7Mha of the 12.5Mha of land in England and is thus the major use of land in\nspite of the huge growth of urbanisation (Defra, 2004). 3.7Mha is permanent grass, of which 0.7Mha\nis rough grazing. The remaining 5Mha is arable cropping, of which typically 0.7Mha is temporary\ngrass. It is evident that farmers\u2019 choices are driven by prices, subsidies, costs and crop yields, and the\nresults of changes in these parameters over time can be seen in the census data, with increasing areas\nof winter wheat in the east and forage maize in the west, with consequential effects on the use of\nherbicides, fertiliser and irrigation. Consequences are observed both in the short term (choice of crop)\nand in the long term (grassland or arable farming).\nChanges in cropping patterns and practices have led to a reduction in the extent of cereal field\nmargins, a Biological Action Plan (BAP, 1995) priority habitat which is important for wildlife. There\nis increasing evidence that the addition of fertilisers, most notably nitrogen, in such habitats has a\nmajor influence on plant species composition, through affecting nutrient availability and productivity\n(Marshall et al., 2001). Galium aparine (cleavers), for example, flourishes in the high fertility sites\nassociated with cereal farming (Grime et al., 1988). The distribution of this species has increased\nfrom a 21% coverage in central England in the 1960s to 88% in 1997 (Sutcliffe and Kay, 2000).\nAlternatively, nitrogen application can be detrimental to arable species which are less competitive\n(Wilson and King, 2003). The decline of many arable weeds over the last 50 years has been partly\nattributed to the increased use of fertilisers (Preston et al., 2002). Scandix pectin veneris (shepherd\u2019s\nneedle), for example, has declined in abundance from the mid 1950s (Stewart et al., 1994).\nExperiments in Hampshire showed how a modern winter wheat variety fertilised at a level typical of\nfarming practice can reduce the numbers of uncommon arable plant species, with S. pectin veneris\ndecreasing from 7.1 plants per m2 with no nitrogen fertiliser application to 4.4 per m2 with half the\namount used in normal practice to 3 per m2 with standard nitrogen inputs (Wilson and King, 2003).\nThis would support the concerns of Parmesan and Yohe (2003) that over the short-term, land use\nchange will be an important driver of local biological changes and this will increase species\u2019\nvulnerability. Berry et al. (2006) also have shown how changes in agriculture could affect species\u2019\nvulnerability under different climate and socio-economic scenarios.\nThe use of models to analyse climate and socio-economic scenarios has become a common way of\nstudying likely future consequences of changes, whether they are due to technology, policy, climate or\nconsumers. Audsley et al. (2006) and Rounsevell et al. (2003) describe a two-step procedure to\nestimate future agricultural land use. Firstly, future crop yields are estimated, and then based on these\nvalues the cropping which optimises the farm\u2019s profitability is estimated. The spatial analysis is based\non identifying the climate and all the significant soil types within a 5 x 5km grid and analysing each\nsoil-climate combination. This is a more spatially detailed analysis than that of Hossell et al. (1996)\nwho use typical regional farms, but has the disadvantage that the analysis is very computer-intensive\nand thus time-consuming. Similar ideas have been developed by Koomen et al. (2005) to predict\nfuture agriculture in Holland, and Munier (2004) in Denmark where the objective was the impact on\necology and the environment. Zander and Kachele (1999) also sought to combine a crop and farm\nmodel but using a crop model based on expert knowledge. This has the advantage of including\ndisease effects which the soil moisture model of Rounsevell et al. (2003) cannot do, but has the\npotential disadvantage of it being very difficult to systematically calculate future crop yields for a\nwide range of circumstances, without including calculations equivalent to the soil moisture model.\nCellular automata, in which changes in the state of a cell (e.g. agriculture to housing) depends also on\nthe state of its adjacent cells, are a common way to carry out spatially explicit analyses of land use (de\nNijs, 2004). These are of most value where the use of land is very much a function of the\nneighbouring use such as with the spread of urban land. In agriculture, similarity between neighbours\nmainly occurs due to similar soil and climate conditions. Changes in land use are more strongly\nrelated to changes in the relative profitability between options. Thus it is most important to analyse\nthe options in each cell, and ignore changes to its neighbouring cells.\nHolman et al. (2005a & b) describe a spatial analysis of two regions in England which integrates an\nanalysis of urban development, flood risk, water flow, water quality and ecological impact with the\nagricultural land use analysis, using very detailed models. However, because of this, the models are\ntime-consuming and the number of situations that can be analysed is very limited. The use of\nscenarios is an attempt to get round the problem of there being a large number of input parameters\nwhich define a situation. Although some may be correlated, there are still an extremely large number\nof significantly different valid combinations of parameters which are not studied. In practice it means\nthat it is difficult to know which changes are actually responsible for the effects observed. Holman et\nal. (2005a and b) studied the effects of climate and economics separately and showed that economics\nhas more effect than climate, but it would be useful to be able to separate the effects within these \u2013 is\nthe climate effect due to winter or summer rainfall, or the economic effect due to yields or costs?\nHowever a detailed analysis of the influence of the many different socio-economic scenario data such\nas prices, costs and yield changes was effectively impossible because of the long run times of such\ndetailed models. The same applies to studying the influence of changes in temperature and rainfall in\nthe climate scenarios on the results. Clearly time required is a function of many things, not least the\nspecification of the computer, but even at one hundredth of a second per year, given 30 years of\nweather, 12 crops and 1226 grids in East Anglia and the North West each with on average 4 soils, the\nelapsed time for one set of crop yield input data is nearly 5 hours. The farm model which is a\nsubstantial linear programme, simulates 10 farms on each soil in each grid which at one tenth of a\nsecond per farm is of the order of 2 hours.\nReplacing the detailed models by metamodels and applying them to representative grids provides a\nsolution. Metamodels are reduced models which endeavour to capture the major systematic effects\nshown in the full models. Metamodels which carry out an equivalent analysis in the order of a\nsecond, enable both a detailed spatial analysis and analysis of the effects of different input parameters.\nThey also enable other features to be introduced such as iteratively adjusting prices based on supply\nand demand and restricting irrigation. Their obvious disadvantage is that they lose some of the\ndetailed and systematic effects of the full models. It may be that the average total response is correct,\nbut it could equally be systematically high or low. Responses at extremes are most likely to suffer,\npartly because of the form of the models and partly because there will be less original data to\ninfluence the fitting of the metamodel. Thus from the infinite set of possible metamodels, it is\npossible to make good and bad choices, and even with careful choice, there is certain to exist a better\none.\nThis paper describes the development of a procedure using metamodels, to investigate interactively,\nspatially explicit future land use given future scenarios, and to relate the resulting distribution of\narable land and nitrogen fertiliser use, to the suitability for species in cereal field margin habitats\nwithin East Anglia and North West England. Figure 1 shows the location of the study regions in\nEngland. As in Holman et al. (2005a), the method is still based on identifying the climate and all the\nsignificant soil types within a 5 x 5 km grid and analysing each soil-climate combination. The\nscenarios define the changes in climate, technology and socio-economics which influence the choices\nmade by farmers, and hence are a major determinant of the ecology and the environment in England.\nHowever unlike traditional scenario modelling, the user is free to change most of the input parameters\nand thus investigate an infinite number of scenarios and study the responses of the system to\nparameters of their choice. The target is to run one complete integrated analysis in less than one\nsecond, though at present this has not quite been achieved, with 10-20 seconds being typical run-times\nfor one scenario analysis.\nFigure 1 Map of England and Wales showing the East Anglian region modelled (right) and\nNorth West (top left)\n2. Methodology\n2.1 Agricultural metamodel\nThe agricultural metamodel is derived from the full agricultural land use estimation model described\nin Rounsevell et al. (2003) and Holman et al. (2005a). The method combines a crop model which\npredicts the yield of a wide range of crops as a function of climate and soil type, with a farm model\n(SWFM) which determines the optimum cropping given crop gross margins, labour and machinery\ncosts and soil workability of a generic farm. In order to differentiate the functions of the models and\nto allow the user to observe the effects of changes to separate aspects, two metamodels, one for each\ncomponent model, were created and combined.\nA considerable amount of data are available from outputs of the full models for both the North West\nand East Anglia, for current climate and the 2050 Low, Medium and High climate scenarios\n(UKCIP98; Hulme et al., 1998) and for all the main soil types found in these regions. The outputs are\ncrop yield, crop maturity date, area of each crop and farm profit, plus other derived information such\nas water use and nitrate leaching. They are a function of very detailed input data on soils, weather\ndata, machinery use, etc. The metamodels are developed to emulate the output using reduced detail\ninput data.\n2.1.1 Crop metamodel\nThe format of a typical file of soil data is shown in Figure 2. Soils typically have 3 to 4 soil horizons,\neach with different soil parameters and a rooting depth up to 150cm. The first step was to derive\nparameters which described the main features of these data which influence the crop yield, namely\nthose which influence the availability and storage of water. The soil data were characterised by:\no the available water content to 100cm depth and 150cm depth (2 parameters)\no the proportion of this water available between five suction levels between Wilting Point and\nField Capacity as a percentage of the 150cm total. (4 parameters)\no surface soil texture index, estimated using the formula Int[(4c+2z+d-78)\/22.2] where c, z, and\nd are the percentage clay, silt and sand respectively and Int[x] is the integer part of x. The\nindex increases as the soil becomes heavier \u2013 more clayey than sandy (1 parameter).\no rooting depth, surface horizon hydraulic conductivity and wilting point soil moisture water\ncontent (3 parameters).\nFigure 2 Typical soil data file used as input data by the full crop model\nSoil series: ANDOVER\nCL,\n50 Number of divisions of soil moisture retention\n1 Number of soil horizons\n25 Attainable rooting depth\n.125 Extintinction coefficient for evaporation\n5 Number of measured points on retention curve\nSuction values for each layer\n51.00 102.00 408.00 2040.00 15300.00\nParameters for layer 1\n0 Top of layer\n25 Bottom of layer\n1.12 Bulk density\n.3893 Initial water content\n.4744 Maximum water content\n.3893 Field capacity\n.1688 Wilting point\n.0563 Air dry water content\n115.60 Saturated hydraulic conductivity\n.0875 Residual water content\n0.0420 Van Genuchten alpha\nThe weather data used by the full crop model consists of the daily air temperature (max and min),\nrainfall, potential evapo-transpiration and radiation. The climate data, from which the daily data were\noriginally generated, consist of monthly means. Climate change scenarios are generally characterised\nin terms of changes in \u2018winter\u2019 or \u2018summer\u2019 half-year precipitation and temperature. The weather\ndata were therefore characterised as:\no annual rainfall and percentage in summer;\no average summer temperature and difference from average winter temperature;\no annual potential evapo-transpiration and percentage in summer.\nThe latitude, carbon dioxide level, which increases yield, and amount of irrigation complete the\ncharacterisation of the data used by the crop model.\nThe procedures for deriving a metamodel for each crop, using artificial neural networks (ANN) are\ndescribed in Appendix 1. Figure 3 illustrates the results for winter wheat. Tests of the resulting\nmodel showed responses which were in accord with expectations. However use of the networks with\nextreme situations has sometimes shown less reasonable responses. This is to be expected as the\nmetamodel has no mechanistic understanding within it, so that using the model outside the training set\nis very inadvisable. Such responses could also indicate deficiencies with the training set or even\ndeficiencies in the original mechanistic model.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nActual Yield\nP\nre\nd\nic\nte\nd\nY\nie\nld\nFigure 3 Performance of neural network for winter wheat yield (t\/ha) \u2013 the yield predicted by the neural\nnetwork is plotted against the actual yield from the full model which the neural network seeks to emulate.\n2.1.2 Farm model\nThe main input to the farm model is the crop gross margins which, given the above crop yields, can be\ncalculated from the crop prices, subsidies and variable costs. As in the full model, calibration\nadjustments were made to the output of the crop model. Data are available from the farm model\ndatabase which is based on East Anglia, from the farm management literature (Nix 2004, ABC 2005)\nand from Defra statistics on cropping in England and Wales. In general yields need to be increased to\nmatch present day levels and reduced in areas of high rainfall to allow for the effects of disease and\nharvest losses. Changes in crop yields for crops not simulated were estimated as pro-rata changes in\nthose of a similar crop type that were simulated\nThe farm model estimates the area of each crop that a farm would grow in order to maximise profit.\nThe crops available to the model were restricted in Rounsevell et al. (2003) and that restriction has\nbeen continued. Thus oilseed rape represents all break crops that can be combine harvested, such as\npeas and beans, even though it is not nitrogen fixing. However the break crop sunflowers, which are\nnot currently a major crop, are modelled separately in order to examine their potential with increasing\ntemperature. Potatoes represent irrigated vegetables. Sugar beet is currently not grown across the\nwhole of England due to the availability of processing factories, but all crops were modelled in both\nregions to examine the potential for crops in the future. Note that the crop model may indicate that\nconditions are climatically unsuitable for a crop.\nThe input data are characterised by:\no crop gross margin of each crop (g)\no soil texture index (s)\no workable hours in the winter (w)\no final date of grass harvesting (proxy for maturity date of each crop) (m)\no winter rainfall (r)\no summer evaporation (e)\no change in labour and machinery costs (\uf068 )\nFor the two irrigated crops, sugar beet and potatoes, the model selects the version for which the level\nof irrigation (0, 100mm, 200mm) gives the highest gross margin, dependent on the availability of\nwater (Henriques et al., 2007).\nA regression approach was adopted to predict the percentage of the area under each crop, using as the\nprimary variables the ratios between the gross margin of the target crop and its competitors, with other\nregressions such as winter workable hours. Given the cropping, the number of animals, other\nexpenditure and finally the profit can be derived. 4264 data points were available for each scenario.\nAppendix 1 describes the detail of the modelling procedure.\nFinally nitrate leaching was estimated using a relationship fitted to the output from the full crop\nmodel. This estimates leached nitrogen as a proportion of excess nitrogen (applied minus crop\nofftake) given the soil index and winter rainfall. Nitrogen applied is assumed to be proportional to\nexpected yield.\n2.1.3 Analysis procedure\nTable 1 Example of soil information for each grid.

Due to mapping differences, these are not identical and the first step is to produce a merged\nset of 5 x 5km grids. Each grid contains areas (cells) classified as different soil types, as shown in\nTable 1. For each soil type there is detailed information on typical soil properties. Some cells only\ncontribute a very small area of the grid, so a minimum threshold of 100ha was set for a cell to be\nincluded; this gives 3526 and 3820 cells in the East Anglia and North West regions respectively.\nBased on the soil and current climate, the cells were combined into 46 and 181 clusters respectively,\nto be analysed by the metamodels (see Appendix 1). The most typical member of each cluster is\nanalysed by the metamodels and the results are then applied to all the cells in that cluster.\nThe areas of each grid available for agriculture are determined using data from the Centre for Ecology\nand Hydrology\u2019s Land Cover Map 2000 (available on http:\/\/www.magic.gov.uk\/) to identify\nagriculture, urban, forested and \u2018other\u2019 land. As far as possible, poor soils are correlated with \u2018other\u2019\nland use. Urban land use is assumed to be independent of soil. The flood metamodel (Richards et al.,\nthis volume) identifies areas which either cannot be designated as agriculture because of frequency of\nflooding (assumed to be currently classified as \u2018other\u2019), or can only be grassland (assumed currently\n\u2018agriculture \u2013 grass\u2019). This then provides the baseline areas where the agricultural model can be\napplied. Results from the agricultural model classify land as intensive agriculture if profit is greater\nthan \u00a321,700\/100 ha, extensive agriculture if profit is greater than \u00a39,300\/100 ha and otherwise as\nabandoned. This gives the level of production of each commodity and irrigation used in each region.\nIn future scenarios, additional areas are removed for urban use in proportion to the scenario-defined\nchange in population, and the areas of flooding identified by the flood metamodel may either increase\nor decrease. The scenarios also define any forested area change.\n2.1.4 Production required and irrigation available\nPreviously in Holman et al (2005a) prices for crops have been set in the scenarios. This mostly gave\nvery extreme answers such as outcomes comprising either large areas of sugar beet and potatoes or\nnone, or even no cropping whatsoever. The economics of supply and demand mean that in cases of\nlow supply, prices will rise and in cases of over-supply, prices will fall. As we are only modelling a\nsmall region, this is complicated by what other UK regions will produce as well as imports and\nexports. The approach taken in this analysis is for the scenario to specify the change in level of\nproduction required from a region and for the model to adjust prices to approximately fit this target\nlevel of production (see Appendix 1). The production required in a scenario is defined using two\nparameters \u2013 one to change all baseline production pro-rata, and one to increase bio-energy\nproduction.\n2.1.5 Outputs\nOutputs are calculated by 5 x 5km grid cell and by region, which can be displayed or used by\nsubsequent models as described in Holman et al. (2007):\n\uf0b7 By 5 x 5km grid cell (displayed as maps): Percentage cropping by crop, production of each\ncommodity (000t by crop), nitrate leaching (kgN\/ha), land use (urban, forest, other), irrigation\nwater used (Ml).\n\uf0b7 By region (displayed as graphs): Land use type (arable, intensive grass, extensive grass,\nabandoned; % of grid), percentage regional cropping, irrigation water used (Ml), nitrate\nleaching (kgN\/ha), land use (urban, forest, agriculture, other), production of each commodity\n(000t by crop).\nOutputs passed to other models: Profit (\u00a3\/ha), N fertiliser inputs (tonnes per grid cell), pesticide\ninputs; % of grid in intensive arable cropping, land use type (arable, intensive grass, extensive grass;\n% of grid), winter versus spring crops; % of grid winter and spring sown crops), agricultural land\nabandoned; % of grid).\n2.1.6 Interactive input parameters\nThe system uses as its starting point the scenarios developed in Holman et al. (2005) which are\ndescribed by storylines. The climate scenarios are those developed on behalf of the United Kingdom\nClimate Impacts Programme (UKCIP02) which are expressed monthly means, on a 5 x 5km grid.\nThe socio-economic scenarios are shown in Table 2. The storylines are converted to the large number\nof specific input parameters required by the models, such as percentage increases in population or\ncrop yields (Holman et al., 2005). By selecting a climate and a socio-economic scenario, default\nvalues are set for a wide range of input parameters. The parameters that are directly relevant to the\nagricultural model are listed in Table 3. A user can then interactively examine the impact of these\nindividual parameters. There are no restrictions on the combinations of values which the user can\nselect although some are identified as improbable futures. In general, values are expressed as a\nchange from current as 100%. The user is unable to change some parameters of the scenarios, notably\nthe percentage setaside and crop subsidy structure.\nTable 2 Description of the 4 socio-economic scenarios\nRegional Global\nSemi-autonomous regions keen\nto promote and maintain their\ndistinctive qualities with\neconomic support\nGlobal solutions to both production\nand the environment.

SPECIES\nemploys an ANN to define bioclimate envelopes based on inputs generated through a climate-\nhydrological process model. The model is trained using existing empirical data on the European\ndistributions of species at a 0.5o latitude\/longitude resolution to enable a wide climate space to be\ncharacterised that captures the climatic range of future scenarios. Once a network is trained and\nvalidated at the European scale, it is then applied at a finer 5 x 5km spatial resolution within the East\nAnglian and North West regions.\nModel performance was statistically analysed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic Curve (AUC) - AUC is a measure of prediction accuracy derived from the Receiver\nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curve (Fielding and Bell, 1997). The ROC curve describes the\ncompromise that is made between the sensitivity (defined as the proportion of true positive\npredictions versus the number of actual positive sites) and false positive fraction (the proportion of\nfalse positive predictions versus the number of actual negative sites). AUC ranges from 0.5 for\nmodels with no discrimination ability, to 1 for models with perfect discrimination. Further details\nconcerning model validation are provided in Pearson et al. (2004). AUC statistics were greater than\n0.9 for all six species, indicating very good discrimination ability.\nPredictions of potential climate space from the SPECIES model were combined with outputs on\nthe area of arable land and nitrogen use from the agricultural metamodel to simulate the\nimpacts of climate and socio-economic changes on the suitability of cereal field margin species\nat the regional scale. The area of arable land was simply applied as a habitat mask. The effects\non plant species of nitrogen fertiliser use were simulated by applying thresholds based on an\nindividual species\u2019 sensitivity to nitrogen derived from the Ellenberg indicator values for\nBritain (Hill et al., 1999). The species were divided into classes indicating low, medium or high\ntolerance to nitrogen increases, as the Ellenberg values are on an arbitrary scale and species\u2019\necological requirements may vary in different parts of their range and according to local\nconditions, thus a broader classification was appropriate (\nTable 4). Galium aparine (cleavers) was assigned to the most tolerant class (class 1). Papaver\ndubium (long-headed poppy), Papaver rhoeas (field poppy) and Silene gallica (Spanish catchfly)\nwere assigned to class 2, whilst Legousia hybrida (Venus\u2019 looking glass) and Scandix pecten-veneris\n(shepherd\u2019s needle) were assigned to the least tolerant class (class 3).\nTable 4 Species\u2019 sensitivity thresholds for nitrogen related to absolute values of nitrogen fertiliser use\n(kg\/ha) from the agricultural land use model.\nSpecies nitrogen (N) sensitivity Thresholds (kg\/ha N)\nClass Description Stressed Unsuitable\n1 Tolerant of N increase 270 to 300 > 300\n2 Some tolerance of N increase 240 to 270 > 270\n3 Little tolerance of N increase 210 to 240 > 240\n3. Results\n3.1 Validation of the agricultural land use metamodel\nTable 5 compares the results of the baseline agricultural metamodel simulations with Defra census\ndata. Note that not all permanent grassland is simulated by the farm model \u2013 only intensive grassland\nsuch as for dairy cows, not upland and rough grazing. Also the model predicts the long-term steady\nstate structure of farming given a set of expected prices at a point in time, whereas farm structure\nactually changes at a slower rate. The results for East Anglia are good. For the North West the\nresults are generally good, with a possible tendency to over-predict winter wheat, though the census\ndata probably includes grassland which has been classified as \u2018other\u2019 land from the Land Cover Map\nin the model. The differences in irrigation are insignificant. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the\npredicted area of winter wheat by the metamodel and the full farm model. A regression of these data\nshows that where the full model would predict zero, the metamodel tends to predict about 7% of the\narea as winter wheat. The full model itself may also be over-predicting winter wheat in the North\nWest, partly due to the fact that the model permits farms with small areas of cereals and partly due to\nnot modelling the effect of the transport to factories which would reduce the on-farm value of small\nvolumes of winter wheat at remote locations. Sugar beet is also permitted even with no factory\nnearby in order to assess whether in the future with increased temperatures there would be sufficient\nproduction of the crop to justify a factory.\nTable 5 Comparison of baseline output from ANN farm model with 2001 June census.

The fourth graph shows the breakdown between\nspring and winter sowing, intensive grassland and agricultural land which becomes unprofitable and is\neither grazed extensively or abandoned. The fifth graph shows fertiliser use and nitrate leaching.\nIn East Anglia\n\uf0b7 Cropping remains quite stable. Grassland is severely reduced in the 2050 High scenarios \u2013\nalmost certainly due to the low yield in the drier conditions.\n\uf0b7 Sunflowers are only selected in one scenario even though they are feasible in climate terms\nfor all of them. The model\u2019s production-target approach means that sunflowers are\neffectively competing to produce oil with oilseed rape which has a higher yield.\n\uf0b7 With all parameters at a minimum, oilseed rape is eliminated and 20% of the area is\nunprofitable for intensive agriculture. This also generates the highest price for water (250%\nof current) due to the very low rainfall and availability. Conversely the all-max scenario\ngenerates the lowest price (24%) due to the combination of very high yields, rainfall and\navailability. This demonstrates the model is capable of making extreme changes where it is\nappropriate.\n\uf0b7 Nitrate leaching increases as fertiliser use increases with the large increases in crop yields in\nthe GM scenarios, because fertiliser requirement is proportional to expected yield. The\nlargest increase occurs with all parameters set to their maximum values, which is mainly a\nreflection of the very high rainfall thus selected.\n\uf0b7 Large increases in bioenergy demand make it impossible to supply the total demand for arable\nproducts.\n\uf0b7 Reductions in irrigation water availability translate into a reduction in potato production.\n\uf0b7 Urban land use decreases in RS because the scenario assumes depopulation of East Anglia\nand increase of forests, but owing to the economics, agricultural land use is least in this\nscenario.\nThe changes can be difficult to relate to one cause. In particular, where the demand for both food\nand energy exceeds feasible production, no cropping solution will meet the demands and the\namount by which demand is not met will be distributed among the crops at random.\nIn the North West\n\uf0b7 There is a very much greater range of outcomes in this region\n\uf0b7 All future scenarios suggest a reduction in grassland with the greatest in the 2050 High\nclimate scenario combined with the Regional Stewardship socio-economic scenario\n(2050H+RS).\n\uf0b7 In the RS scenario, the low level of demand for milk products, which can easily be supplied\nfrom a smaller area, and the flat subsidy structure encourages the widest range of break\ncropping.\n\uf0b7 The reduction in grassland shows a clear correlation with increased climate change. With\nlower temperatures grassland is at similar levels to the baseline.\n\uf0b7 In a reversal of the East Anglia situation, having all parameters set to their maximum values\ncauses some land to become abandoned. The demand for a high production level of milk\nforces it to be satisfied but at a high price (twice present), though due to the large yield\nincreases a relatively modest area is needed. The demand for arable crops in the North West\nis also easily satisfied. The high rainfall and costs make any additional production generally\nuneconomical and thus the balance of land becomes extensive.\n\uf0b7 Sustainability scenarios (RS and GS) cause the greatest reductions in grassland.\nFigure 12 to Figure 14 show a selection of the spatial effects displayed by the interface for East\nAnglia. The overall levels obviously reflect those in the Figure 11 and, in some cases, the fixed\nranges for the shading obscure the fact that spatially the pattern in the scenario is identical to that in\nthe baseline. Figure 12 shows the proportion of each grid square that is winter wheat for the baseline\nand two future 2050s scenarios. In both the future scenarios shown there is a clear tendency to a more\neven spread of winter wheat than in the baseline, particularly in the RS case, driven by the high flat\nlevel of subsidy, where 52% of grids are in the range where 30-40% of the grid is winter wheat.\nFigure 13 illustrates the irrigation demand for the same scenarios which shows the same spreading\neffect in the RS scenario. The Global Markets scenario shows both a reduction in the areas with no\nirrigation and those with the maximum level. Both show a reduction in irrigation, which may seem\ncounter-intuitive, but it is driven by the imposed limit on available water. The map shows the\nlevelling effect of the high level of crop-independent subsidy.\nFigure 14 examines the effect of increasing irrigation water availability on potatoes. There is a clear\nincrease in area as irrigation availability increases from 168 Ml\/d to 420 Ml\/d, but thereafter no\nincrease.\nFigure 15 and Figure 16 show a selection of the spatial effects displayed by the interface for the North\nWest region for the baseline and two future scenarios. Figure 15 illustrates the increasing area of\nwinter wheat grown in the North West in the 2050 scenarios with the crop moving to the north of the\nregion, where it now becomes more profitable. Figure 16 shows the corresponding data for intensive\ngrassland. Note that these figures are the percentage of the grid area not of the agricultural area, so\nthat areas of high urbanisation appear as very low, even if most of the non-urban land is grass.\n3.2.1 Examining the sensitivities of the results to climate change\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nBaseline\nA -50%\nA -21%\n2050H + GM\nA +11%\nA +50%\nB +0\u00b0C\nB +0.9\u00b0C\n2050H + GM\nB +3.5\u00b0C\nB +5\u00b0C\nC -50%\nC -4%\n2050H + GM\nC +21%\nC +50%\n%Wheat %Barley %Potatoes %Sbeet %Sunflower %Oilseed rape %Forage\nFigure 5 The sensitivity of the cropping for East Anglia for scenario 2050High+GlobalMarket to A)\nsummer precipitation change B) annual temperature change and C) winter precipitation change \u2013\npercentage of area in each crop.\nFigure 5 and Figure 6 show a study of the sensitivity of the conclusions to the climate change\nuncertainty. The analysis is repeated using different rainfall and temperature assumptions. The\nvalues shown on the graph above and below the default value for the scenario (2050H+GM), are the\nupper and lower credible changes and the upper and lower extreme changes. Figure 5 for East Anglia\nshows that the summer precipitation increasing by 11%, instead of decreasing by 18%, would almost\nreturn the cropping to the current distribution - further increases would have little more effect.\nExtremely low values (decreasing by 50%) would eliminate grass (shown as forage) and encourage\nsunflowers. Increased summer temperatures have similar effects to reducing summer precipitation.\nWinter precipitation is not important. Figure 6 for North West shows that for summer precipitation\nonly very high levels (that is increasing by 50%, instead of decreasing by 16%) make a notable\ndifference, causing arable cropping to be unattractive. However both higher and lower levels of\nannual temperature increase the forage area. Winter precipitation is again unimportant.\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nBaseline\nA -50%\nA -21%\n2050H + GM\nA +11%\nA +50%\nB +0\u00b0C\nB +1\u00b0C\n2050H + GM\nB +3.5\u00b0C\nB +5\u00b0C\nC -50%\nC +4%\n2050H + GM\nC +21%\nC +50%\n%Wheat %Barley %Potatoes %Sbeet %Sunflower %Oilseed rape %Forage\nFigure 6 The sensitivity of the cropping for North West for scenario 2050High+GlobalMarket to A)\nsummer precipitation change (default scenario: -16%) B) annual temperature change (default scenario:\n+2.1\u00b0C) and C) winter precipitation change (default scenario: +8%) \u2013 percentage of area in each crop.\n3.3 Effect on species\nNone of the six species modelled lose climate space in East Anglia, but they all gain some climate\nspace in the North West ranging from 2% for Papaver rhoeas to 62% for Legousia hybrida under the\n2050 High scenario. Arable land use is widespread in East Anglia and using land use data from the\nagricultural model to mask out cells with only non-arable land extracts only 3% of cells under all the\nscenarios, which are mainly situated around the coast. For the North West region, arable land use is\ngradually gained as the climate change scenarios become more severe, with the number of cells\ncontaining some arable land increasing from 70% for the baseline climate up to 91% under the 2050\nHigh scenario, due to arable cultivation becoming profitable at higher elevations in the north and east\nof the region. Differences between the socio-economic scenarios are much smaller, ranging from 90\nto 92% of cells when combined with the 2050 High climate scenario, with the Global Markets and\nRegional Enterprise scenarios resulting in slightly less arable land use than the Global Sustainability\nand Regional Stewardship scenarios.\nIn contrast, the effects of nitrogen fertiliser use on the suitability of species shows much greater\ndifferences between the socio-economic scenarios, as illustrated in Figure 7 for the East Anglia case\nstudy region. Suitability for S. pectin veneris, which has a low tolerance to nitrogen, is lowest under\nthe Regional Enterprise scenario where between 20 and 27% of grid cells are classified as being\nmarginal due to nitrogen stress, whilst between 4 and 8% are classified as unsuitable. This is\nfollowed by the Global Markets scenario, where between 13 and 17% are classified as marginal due to\nnitrogen stress, whilst approximately 1% are unsuitable. Finally, the Global Sustainability and\nRegional Stewardship scenarios show all grid cells to be suitable. It can also be noted from Figure 7\nthat that the suitability is slightly worse under the 2050 Low climate scenario combined with the\ndifferent socio-economic scenarios than the 2050 High scenario, because as shown in Figure 11 there\nis slightly more nitrogen input in the former case.\nDifferences between the three classes of species\u2019 sensitivities to nitrogen increases are shown in\nFigure 8 for the North West region under the 2050 Low and Regional Enterprise scenario. Only 3%\nof grid cells are classified as marginal due to nitrogen stress for the most tolerant species, Galium\naparine. For Papaver rhoeas (medium tolerance), 13% are marginal and 4% become unsuitable due\nto nitrogen increases. The least tolerant species, Legousia hybrida, shows 12% of grid cells becoming\nmarginal and 16% becoming unsuitable due to nitrogen stress. Results for other species are similar to\nthose illustrated in\nFigure 8 for the relevant tolerance class.\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n(e) (f)\nFigure 7 Suitability for Scandix pectin veneris in East Anglia: (a) 2050Low+RegionalEnteprise; (b)\n2050High+RegionalEnterprise; (c) 2050Low+GlobalMarket; (d) 2050High+GlobalMarket; (e)\n2050Low+RegionalStewardship; and (f) 2050High+RegionalStewardship.

It is a\ncommon weed in cereal field margins and can interfere with harvesting and lead to crop\ncontamination (Taylor, 1999). In experiments on its impact on yields, losses in winter wheat of 30%,\n47% and 52% were reported at densities of 25, 100 and 520 plants per m2 (Froud Williams, 1985). G.\naparine, along with P. rhoeas and Anisantha sterilis (Barren brome) have been shown to compete\nincreasingly effectively with spring wheat with increasing levels of nitrogen (Lintell Smith et al.,\n1992). It can be effectively controlled by the use of herbicides (Lutman et al., 1988) and so it could\nbe adversely affected if these increases in nitrogen inputs were associated with a concomitant increase\nin its abundance and thus in herbicides usage. This increase in nitrogen could also lead to a decrease\nin abundance of P. dubium and S. pecten-veneris (MacNaughton and Harper, 1964 and Wilson and\nKing, 2003 respectively). The results show that those species with a low or medium tolerance to\nnitrogen inputs are likely to become significantly affected under the Regional Enterprise and Global\nMarkets socio-economic scenarios. This is because their growth response to the increased nitrogen\ninputs is lower than the crop and other more competitive species, such as G. aparine, and thus they\nare increasingly suppressed through competition (Wilson and King, 2003). Tall growing species, like\nPapaver spp., may reach crop canopy height, but are unable to compete with the crop\u2019s response to\nnitrogen, while lower growing species, such as S. pecten-veneris are affected on both accounts. This\nreduced productivity will affect their reproductive capacity and thus contribute to their decline in\nabundance, as has already been seen over the last 50 years.\nIn order to reduce the impacts on species with low and medium tolerances to nitrogen, a possible\nadaptation option would be to restrict chemical inputs. This can be implemented through changing\nthe crop variable costs within the agricultural metamodel. Although this is a composite variable of\nwhich currently 40% represents fertiliser, it is assumed that any reduction represents a switch from\nchemical to organic nitrogen inputs (greater use of nitrogen fixing crops). Crop variable costs under\nthe 2050 Low and Regional Enterprise scenario were reduced from 160% to 125% of current. The\nimpact of nitrogen fertiliser on suitability is greatly reduced, as illustrated in Figure 9 for S. pecten\nveneris in East Anglia. Here, the number of grid cells classified as marginal due to nitrogen stress are\nreduced from 27 to 0.5%, and those classified as unsuitable due to nitrogen are reduced from 8 to 0%.\nSuitable\nMarginal\n(N stress)\nUnsuitable\n(N stress)\nUnsuitable\n(climate space or\nhabitat)\nAlready there are several agri-environment schemes targeted at decreasing the impacts of nitrogen\ninputs on biodiversity and research has shown that reductions in fertiliser usage can lead to the\nrestoration of habitats and species (Mountford et al., 1996; Critchley et al., 2004). The adoption of\nsuch a policy though, depends on the socio-economic scenario, being less likely under Global Markets\ntype of future scenario.\n(b) (b)\nFigure 9 Adaptation option for reducing nitrogen stress for Scandix pectin veneris under the\n2050Low+RegionalEnterprsie scenario: (a) using default crop variable costs of 160% of current; and (b)\nusing reduced crop variable costs of 125% of current.\n4. Discussion\nThe major advantage of the metamodel approach is the large number of analyses that can be carried\nout in a short space of time, which it is difficult to do justice to in a paper such as this. A single run of\nthe whole system typically takes about 20 seconds (Holman et al., 2007), though speed of computer\nhas a large impact, as does the number of habitats selected for analysis. Of this the agriculture\nmetamodels take 1.5 seconds. This enables impacts to be studied in far more detail, though it\nfrequently raises new questions as to why a response happens. This should however be viewed in a\npositive light as, where previously the answers were simply a black box to be taken on trust, it is now\npossible for a user to study what is happening in response to changes in some detail. The fact that it\nleads to questions enables the research to move forward either to explain the results (by providing\nmore detail in the output), expand on the options available (more input parameters), or correct the\nfunctioning of the models \u2013 which may be a fault in the underlying model or in the metamodel\nrepresentation.\nA major disadvantage remains the time taken for a solution. Although 20 seconds is not long, it\nremains restrictive in trying to view a change in a result versus a change in a parameter. Metamodels\nare also not the same as the full models. There remains a need for greater study of the responses of\nthe metamodels to ensure they do not contain hidden unexpected correlations that only become\napparent at extreme values. Some areas have already been resolved, such as the negative quadratic\nresponse of a crop to its gross margin \u2013 so that at very high gross margins, none of the crop was\ngrown. A problem was also identified where the area of wheat was correlated with a high gross\nmargin of grass \u2013 a reflection of the fact that areas that are very good for one crop are generally very\ngood for all crops.\nThe setting of production level not price in a scenario has not resolved all the problems with\nunreasonable cropping solutions. For several of the standard scenarios it is impossible to meet the\nproduction demanded (largely due to the demand for bio-energy), which causes prices to increase to\npotentially unreasonable levels. Because there is no associated model for the areas outside the two\nregions modelled (UK or world) to determine the potential for imports or exports, the production level\nmerely implies that all land in the region, which could reasonably be used for agriculture, is used. It\nleaves the question of whether the shortage of supply should transfer to another region.\nInformation on the tolerances of individual species to nitrogen fertilisers is generally limited and a\nsubject of debate. Researchers such as McCloskey et al. (1996) have found that the impacts of the\nSuitable\nMarginal\n(N stress)\nUnsuitable\n(N stress)\ncultivation management regime on 12 arable weeds (including G. aparine and P. rhoeas) may\noutweigh those of the amount and form of fertiliser used, while Lintell Smith et al. (1999) found that\nthe level of nitrogen inputs did not affect the life cycle stages of A. sterilis. This may be due to\ncompensatory changes in the effects of intra-specific competition (Lintell Smith et al., 1992). Other\nstudies have suggested that nitrogen application can be detrimental to arable species, especially those\nwhich are less competitive (Wilson and King, 2003). Hence, the results from the biodiversity model\nfor cereal field margin species should be treated with due caution bearing in mind that the thresholds\nfor the three tolerance classes had to be defined from the scant data available and expert opinion. The\nsensitivity of the cereal field margins modelling to the input threshold values has not been tested and\nfuture work could include the use of various parameterisations for each species, so that different\n\u2018scenarios\u2019 of potential nitrogen impacts can be derived.\n4.1 Scope for improvement\nThe evaluation of the REGIS2 tool showed that users were broadly satisfied with this system (Holman\net al, 2007). Run time was of concern. The main areas for improvement can be divided into the\nspeed of the system (for which agriculture is a small part), user interaction and the accuracy and detail\nof the modelling (which can be sub-divided into the full model and its metamodel representations). In\naddition our own examination of the system has shown some areas where performance of the models\nwas poor. The following summarises some of the improvements likely to make most impact:\nSpeed\n\uf0b7 Replace the slow parts of the system with faster metamodels\n\uf0b7 Improve coding of existing metamodels to eliminate wasteful calculations\nUser interaction\n\uf0b7 Divide some of the agricultural input parameters into their components such as fertilisers and\nsprays, production levels of each commodity, yield increases of individual crops\n\uf0b7 Provide more detail of the output in response to user requirements\nAccuracy - metamodels\n\uf0b7 Improve detail of interactions between yield, chemical and organic fertiliser, and spray costs\nand restrictions\n\uf0b7 Improve performance of farm metamodels for extreme values of gross margins\n\uf0b7 Improve performance of price\/production iteration method\nAccuracy \u2013 full models\n\uf0b7 Improve performance of the crop models\n\uf0b7 Improve performance for identifying potential agricultural land where currently it is not.\n5. Conclusions\nAgricultural land use in East Anglia shows little change in the balance of arable cropping due to\nclimate but a substantial reduction in the already small area of grassland in the 2050 High climate\nscenarios. Large increases in bio-energy demand make it impossible to supply the total demand for\narable products. Reductions in irrigation water availability translate into a reduction in potato\nproduction. The North West shows increasing arable cropping with consequent reductions in\ngrassland as future temperatures increase. Sustainability scenarios cause the greatest reductions in\ngrassland. These conclusions are stable over quite a large range of temperature assumptions for the\nfuture climate and are independent of assumptions about winter precipitation.\nThese changes in cropping patterns could lead to an increase in habitat availability for cereal field\nmargin species in the North West. In both regions, any changes in agricultural inputs need to be\ncoupled with the sensitivity of the species and the modelling has shown how species intolerant of high\nnitrogen conditions could be impacted under future socio-economic scenarios.\nLinking the agricultural and biodiversity metamodels in an integrated system and including\nmetamodels for flooding and water resources (Henriques et al, 2007) enabled knock-on effect and\nfeedbacks between the different sectors to be analysed in a way that would not be possible in a purely\nsectoral modelling study.\nThe research has shown it is possible to produce an interactive system to allow a detailed examination\nof the impact of a wide range of climate change and socio-economic change parameters on the future\nof agriculture and associated species in spatial detail. The resulting time for one run of the analysis is\nstill longer than desirable at 20 seconds but nevertheless is sufficient to stimulate users to ask\nquestions about the cause of responses observed to changes in parameters. Perhaps even more\nimportantly it enables the researchers themselves to carry out far more analyses than was previously\npossible and thus lead to the identification of improvements needed to the analyses. However there\nremains a conflict between the desire for speed of analysis and the desire for increased detail of\nanalysis, which, ironically, being impractical was previously not an issue.\nAppendix 1: Metamodel procedures to predict cropping and profit for a soil climate\ncombination\nCrop model\nThe available data to derive a metamodel for each crop consisted of up to 12000 data points, fewer\nwhere the crop did not mature. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were fitted to this data using QNet\n(2000). The first step is to select a training data set from the full set which covers the full range of\nvalues of each of the input variables. A description of the number of layers used is given in Table 6.\nFor a full 17_10_5_1 network with no connections removed, the number of fitted parameters are\n(17+1)*10+(10+1)*5+(5+1)*1. The minimum correlation required from the test set for a fit to be\naccepted was 0.95. Figure 3 illustrates the results for winter wheat. Tests of the resulting model\nshowed responses to major variables (Figure 10) which were in accord with expectations. However\nuse of the networks with extreme situations has sometimes shown less reasonable responses. This is\nto be expected as the metamodel has no mechanistic understanding within it so that using the model\noutside the training set is very unadvisable. Such responses could also indicate deficiencies with the\ntraining set or even deficiencies in the original mechanistic model.\nTable 6 Description of neural networks used for fitting crop yields\nCrop Network\nstructure\nMinimum\nsummer\ntemperature\nWinter Wheat 17-10-5-1 -\nSpring barley 17-10-5-1 -\nSpring oilseed rape 17-5-2-2-1 -\nPotatoes 18-10-5-1 11.65\nSugar beet 18-10-5-2-1 12.55\nSunflowers 17-10-5-1 14.65\nGrass 17-10-5-1 -\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nInput value (% of max)\nY\nie\nld\n(t\n\/h\na)\nAvailable water content, cm (4.28 - 22) Root depth, cm (25 - 150)\nRain, mm (831 - 1600) Summer Temp, \u00b0C (10-16)\nAverage Summer Winter Temp Difference, \u00b0C (6.3 - 7.8) Summer Evapotranspiration, % of Annual (68 - 83)\nSummer Rain, % of Annual (10 - 90) Standard Value (Yield = 4.69 t\/ha)\nFigure 10 Testing the responses of the neural network predicting the winter wheat yield. Each line shows\nthe effect on the output (yield) of changing a single input value over the specified range.\nFarm model\nFor each scenario, 4264 data points were available from runs of the full farm model for a wide range\nof soils and situations. In this case a regression type of approach was adopted to predict the\npercentage of the area in a given crop, using as the primary variables the ratios between the gross\nmargin of the target crop and its competitors. Table 7 lists the regressions found. Where any fitted\nfarm area is negative, the crop area is taken as zero. The final crop areas are then scaled to be 100%\nin total. For grass and winter wheat the fitted variable is: ))1.01\/()1.0ln(( \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b aa and for\npermanent grass: 1.09)exp(100\n)exp(100\n10 \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d \uf02b aa XX where X is given in Table 7 and an denotes the area of\ncrop n.\nTable 7 Linear regression of crop area versus gross margin and soil type parameters. The input data are\ncrop gross margin (g), the soil index (s), workable hours in the winter\/1000 (w), the maturity date (m),\nautumn and spring rainfall (r_a and r_s), summer evaporation (e) and yield (yN) of crop N. For forage\ncrops g is the yield*10 (dry matter yield for grass). vN is the ratio between the crop gross margin of crop\nN and the crop being fitted.\nN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nCrop Winter\nWheat\nSpring\nWheat\nWinter\nBarley\nSpring\nBarley\nSugar\nBeet\nPotatoes Winter\nOSRape\nSpring\nOSRape\nRot\u2019l\nGrass\nPerm\nGrass\nForage\nMaize\nConst -11.2 -7.7 -9.1 -13.4 -12.1 -28.1 23.8 -40.9 -12.9 -0.9 33\ns 0.2 -0.1 -8.5 -0.2 -0.1 -7.3 5.3 -0.2 -3.9 0 0.1\nw 1.3 2.2 -2.4 0.8 5.1 9.5 1.9 0.2 -4.7 -2.6 -10.3\n1\/w -0.03 -0.15 0.21 -0.17 -0.03 -0.51 -0.34 0.02 -0.46 16.2 0.01\nr_a 0.9\n1\/r_s -0.2\nv1 4.7 8.6 0 68.7 -64.2 0.5 2.6 -3.9 1.6\nv3 5.8\nv4 -12.5 49\nv5 -2.8 -6.2 4.7 -2 -18 5.3 -18.4 -44.9 7.3 87\nv6 -0.1 29.5\nv7 -0.2 4.3 3.2 0 0.3 8.2 3.8\nv8 26.5\nv9 0.439 1.5 2.4 1.9 0.2 0 -3.4 -1.1 -16.3\nv11 -0.01 -15.7\ng 0.002 -0.068 0.017 -0.053 0.005 0.017 0.07 0.051 0.667 0.099 0.254\ng2 0.588 0.037 0.67 -0.014 0.026 0.221 -0.012 0.374 -2.48 -3.603\nr_s 20.2 -37.3 19.9 7.4 -4.3 43.7 -2.2 9.9 -7 20.5\n1\/e 1.1\nm 90\ny10 0.03 0 0.04 0.03 -0.18 -0.39 -0.11 -0.01 -0.39\ny11 -0.1\nThe workable hours in winter is a function of the soil and rainfall:\n))07.3714.6exp((3347 rsw \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d ,\nand the final date of grass harvesting:\n)5.0\/567.0\/33.966.11631.37int( \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d rerem .\nWhere e is the summer evapotranspiration\nFor future scenarios, the basic crop gross margins are initially adjusted for other factors:\nmItyhspyg \uf079\uf074\uf06c\uf068\uf06e\uf06c\uf06c \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d )6.04.0( where p is the scenario crop price, y is the\npredicted yield, \u03bb the scenario increase in yield due to technology, s the subsidy, h the crop variable\ncost per hectare, \uf06e the scenario increase in chemical costs, t is the crop variable cost per tonne, I is\nthe amount of irrigation required adjusted for scenario efficiency changes, \uf074 the scenario irrigation\ncost and \uf079 a crop-dependent factor for delayed maturity.\nIn order to calculate the profitability of a soil climate combination, a number of other variables are\nneeded:\nThe number of cows, which may be zero, is calculated from the bulk fodder produced:\nmg yyC 069.00167.0 \uf02b\uf03d where yg = total grass yield (t) and ym = total maize yield (t)\nExpenditure:\nmswwsrCAE 872.0\/127.0\/12900544.034.18.15508.0000417.00.51 \uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\nProfit, \u00a3\u2018000 per \u201800ha, is given by\nECgAP \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d 1000\/1000\/ ,\nwhere A is the sum of the crop gross margins and g is the cow gross margin.\nSpatial clustering\nBased on the soil and current climate, the cells were combined into 46 and 181 clusters respectively,\nto be analysed by the metamodels. The cluster analysis was carried out in Genstat (2004). A\nsimilarity matrix is constructed by calculating the Euclidean distance between each cell. The\nsimilarity matrix provides the input to the clustering procedure which uses agglomeration to add\nindividuals to a group if its overall similarity at a given stage is greater than the current similarity\nlevel. The method of calculating the distance from a group can either be \u2018furthest\u2019, which produces\nvery tight clusters or \u2018average\u2019 for less tightly knit clusters. The former was used for the North West\nbecause of the very large range of weather data. The process successively merges clusters\/individuals\nat lower and lower levels of similarity, to produce a dendogram. The similarity threshold level of 97%\nwas chosen to give the clusters used in the analysis. The most typical member of each cluster is\nanalysed by the metamodels and the results are then applied to all the cells in that cluster.\nPrice iteration\nThe model iterates, altering the prices of crops and water, to obtain a level of production and irrigation\nwithin a pre-defined tolerance of the target production.

The new ratio of the price to the baseline price is\ndefined as ))((1.0 11\n* pfDspp \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d , where D is the required production. The maximum change\npermitted in one iteration is 0.2. For East Anglia, milk production is unlimited and for the North\nWest, arable production is unlimited.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out as part of the RegIS2 project (CC0362) funded by the UK\nDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs.\nReferences\nABC (2005) The Agricultural Budgeting and Costing Book.
