The dynamical properties of a classical particle bouncing between two\nrigid walls, in the presence of a drag force, are studied for the case where one wall is\nfixed and the other one moves periodically in time.

For a simplified version of the model\nit is shown that, at low energies corresponding to the region of the chaotic sea in the\nnon-dissipative model, the particle wanders in a chaotic transient that depends on the\nstrength of the drag coefficient. However, the KAM islands survive in the presence of\ndissipation. It is confirmed that the fixed points and periodic orbits go over smoothly\ninto the orbits of the well-known (non-dissipative) Fermi-Ulam model as the drag force\ngoes to zero.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.-a, 05.45.Ac, 05.45.Pq\n1. Introduction\nA class of one-dimensional time-dependent systems that has been exhaustively\ninvestigated in recent years is those related to the so-called one-dimensional Fermi\naccelerator model. The latter was originally proposed by Enrico Fermi [1] in order\nto describe the acceleration of cosmic rays. It provides a mechanism through which\ncharged particles can be accelerated by collisions with time-dependent magnetic fields.\nThe model was subsequently studied in different versions and using a number of different\napproaches [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. One of them, known as the Fermi-Ulam model (FUM),\nconsiders the dynamics of a classical particle bouncing between two rigid walls, one of\nwhich is fixed and the other moves in time. The main result for periodic oscillation is\nthat the phase space presents Kolmogorov-Arnol\u2019d-Moser (KAM) islands surrounded\nPublished in J. Phys. A. Math. Gen. 39, 11399-11415 (2006).\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 2\nby a chaotic sea. Unlimited energy growth (i.e. the condition for observing Fermi\nacceleration) is not, however, observed because the phase space exhibits a set of invariant\nspanning curves [7]. An alternative version of this model proposed by Pustylnikov [8],\noften referred to as a bouncer, consists of a classical particle falling in a constant\ngravitational field, on a moving platform. Its most important property is that, in\ncontradistinction to the FUM, depending on both the initial conditions and control\nparameters, there is no bound on the energy gained by the bouncing particle. This\nspecial difference between the models was later clarified by Lichtenberg, Lieberman and\nCohen [9]. We have recently proposed [10] a hybrid version of the Fermi-Ulam accelerator\nand bouncer models. The system behaves not exclusively as pure Fermi-Ulam nor as a\npure bouncer model, but as a combination of the two. We used a simplified version of\nthe model to obtain analytically the conditions for which properties that are individually\npresent in the Fermi-Ulam (high energy invariant spanning curves) and bouncer models\n(low energy invariant spanning curves) but that, come out and coalesce together in the\nhybrid version of the model. The corresponding quantum versions of both the bouncer\nmodel and FUM have also been studied [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].\nThe special interest attached to studying these one-dimensional classical systems is\nthat they are completely integrable for zero external time-dependent forcing, but non-\nintegrable when the external forcing is switched on. Furthermore, they allow direct\ncomparison of theoretical predictions with experimental results [16, 17, 18]. Such\nsystems present a very rich phase space structure. Depending on the values of the\ncontrol parameters, as well as on the initial conditions, periodic, quasi-periodic and\nchaotic behaviour all can be observed. This mixed phase space structure has also been\nobserved for one-dimensional time-dependent potentials [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] and for\nbilliards with static boundaries [25, 26, 27, 28], and it seems to be generic for non-\ndegenerate Hamiltonian systems. When time-dependent boundaries are considered for\nsuch billiards, however, the scenario that arises is quite different. One of the main\nquestions addressed in studies of such problems is how the energy of the particle varies\nwith time and, in particular, whether or not the system can exhibit the phenomenon\nof Fermi acceleration. A discussion of these very interesting questions, together with\nspecific examples, can be found in Ref. [29] where the authors conjectured that:\n\u201cChaotic dynamics of a billiard with a fixed boundary is a sufficient condition for\nFermi acceleration in the system when a boundary perturbation is introduced\u201d. Recently,\nthe well-known annular billiard has been investigated [30, 31] to try and verify this\nconjecture and to enlarge the number of cases to which it is applicable.\nIt is also interesting to investigate the effects of dissipation in these systems.\nDifferent kinds of perturbation can be introduced including: (i) a loss of energy at\neach impact, through inelastic collisions with the moving wall; or (ii) the effect of a\nfrictional (drag) force. For the bouncer model, with the dissipation introduced via\ninelastic collisions, a variety of interesting results were found [32, 33, 34], while the\nversion with a frictional force was carefully analyzed in [35, 36]. For the FUM with\ninelastic collisions, remarkable effects of the dissipation on its dynamics and other\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 3\nproperties were discussed [37, 38, 39] and, in particular, crisis events were observed\nand characterized [40]. A more complex case consisting of a combination of the FUM\nwith a half-stadium was discussed [41]. However, an important question that, to our\nknowledge, has not yet been addressed relates to what happens with the asymptotic\nbehaviour of individual initial conditions to the FUM when \u2013 as is so often the case in\npractice \u2013 a frictional force is present. This seems to be a lacuna for both the complete\nand simplified versions of the FUM.\nIn this paper we study a dissipative version of the FUM. It consists of a classical\nparticle bouncing between two rigid walls in the presence of a drag force. As usual, we\nsuppose one wall to be fixed and the other to move periodically in time. We characterize\nthe dynamics of this system by using a two-dimensional nonlinear map, and we consider\nit in two different versions: (i) complete; and (ii) simplified. The map is obtained via\nthe solution of differential equations. We will show that, under the perturbation of the\ndrag force, the dynamics of this system becomes very different from that of the non-\ndissipative case and that, furthermore, the nature of the differences varies depending\non the region considered. In the high energy domain of both versions, where it is well-\nknown that invariant spanning curves exist in the non-dissipative case, the velocity\nof the particle decreases linearly with increasing iteration number. In the low energy\ndomain, within the region corresponding to the chaotic sea for the non-dissipative case,\nthe particle experience a chaotic transient that depend on the magnitude of the drag\nforce coefficient. For these regions, the asymptotic behaviour of the particle is to come\nto rest. Thus the drag force dissipates all of the particle\u2019s initial energy. We will find,\nhowever, that the dynamics of the particle near fixed points differs markedly between\nthe two versions of the model. For the complete version, the particle approaches the\nfixed point exponentially as the iteration number evolves, at a rate depending on the\nstrength of the drag coefficient. In the simplified version, however, the KAM islands\nsurvive the perturbation. In particular, we will show that the fixed points and the\ncorresponding map go over smoothly to the fixed points and map of the non-dissipative\nFUM. A short letter reporting the observation of area preservation within the simplified\nFUM, has already been published [42].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide all details needed to\nconstruct the map describing the dynamics of the complete version, and we discuss\nthe numerical results obtained from it. Section 3 describes some properties of the\nsimplified version, presents a connection with the non-dissipative FUM and also reports\nthe numerical results. Finally, we summarize and draw conclusions in section 4.\n2. Map derivation for the complete version of the FUM under a frictional\nforce\nThe model thus consists of a classical particle of massm, confined between and bouncing\nelastically between a wall fixed at x = l and a wall moving periodically in time according\nto the equation xw(t) = \u03b5 cos(\u03c9t). The parameter \u03b5 is the amplitude of oscillation while\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 4\n\u03c9 denotes the angular frequency. The particle experiences a drag force, equivalent to\nbeing immersed in a fluid of viscosity \u03b7\u2032, e.g. a gas, that we suppose to be unaffected\nby the motion of the moving wall. The dynamics of this model is described via a map\nT that gives the velocity of the particle immediately after a collision with the moving\nwall as well as the time of that collision, i.e. (vn+1, tn+1) = T(vn, tn). Before starting to\nconstruct the map, we first discuss the initial conditions. We suppose that at a time\nt = tn and after suffering a collision with the moving wall, the particle has initial velocity\nv = vn and its position is given by xp(tn) = \u03b5 cos(\u03c9tn). The velocity and position of the\nparticle are completely specified by solution of Newton\u2019s Second Law\n\u2211\nF = ma. In this\ncase we assume that\n\u2211\nF = \u2212\u03b7\u2032v where a = dv\/dt is the acceleration. The differential\nequation that must be solved is therefore\n\u2212\u03b7\u2032v = m\ndv\ndt\n. (1)\nSolution of Eq. (1) for the given initial conditions and redefining the time as t\u2192 t\u2212 tn,\nfor t \u2265 tn, yields\nvp(t) = vne\n\u2212\u03b7t , (2)\nwhere we have defined \u03b7 = \u03b7\u2032\/m. Considering now vp(t) = dxp(t)\/dt and using both\nthe initial conditions and Eq. (2), we obtain the position of the particle as\nxp(t) = \u03b5 cos(\u03c9tn) +\nvn\n\u03b7\n[\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7t\n]\n. (3)\nLet us now discuss the different possibilities that may arise in our model. Depending\non both the initial velocity vn and initial time tn, they are:\n(a) The particle suffers another collision with the moving wall before exiting the\ncollision area. Such a collision will be referred to as a successive collision.\n(b) The particle exits the collision area without suffering a further collision.\nThe collision area is defined as the interval x \u2208 [\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5] within it is possible for the\nparticle to collide with the time-varying wall.\nIn case (a), the condition for observing successive collisions is obtained from\nxp(t) = xw(t) for xp(t) \u2264 \u03b5. This leads to the transcendental equation\ng(tc) = \u03b5 cos[\u03c9(tn + tc)]\u2212 \u03b5 cos(\u03c9tn)\u2212\nvn\n\u03b7\n[1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7tc ] , (4)\nwhere tc is the smallest root of Eq. (4) for tc \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0\/\u03c9]. The same discussion\nof the redefined time also holds here for tc. Note however that the time tc = 0 is\nexcluded because it is a fixed point of g(tc) = 0. The velocity immediately after\nthe impact with the moving wall is obtained from the requirement that energy and\nmomentum in the frame of reference of the moving wall be conserved. This procedure\nis needed because, at the moment of impact, the moving wall can be considered to\nbe instantaneously at rest. The new velocity is given by vn+1 = \u2212vne\n\u2212\u03b7tc + 2vw(tn+1)\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 5\nwhere vw(t) = dxw(t)\/dt = \u2212\u03b5\u03c9 sin(\u03c9t). For such a successive collision, the map is then\nwritten as\nTs :\n{\nvn+1 = \u2212vne\n\u2212\u03b7tc \u2212 2\u03b5\u03c9 sin(tn+1)\ntn+1 = tn + tc\n. (5)\nThe index \u201cs\u201d denotes that the mapping describes successive collisions. If g(tc) does not\nhave a solution for tc \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0\/\u03c9] we may conclude that the particle leaves the collision\narea without suffering a further collision, so that case (b) applies. Either of two different\nthings may then occur: (b1) the drag force dissipates part of the energy of the particle\nand, after it hits the fixed wall and is reflected backwards, it suffers another collision\nwith the moving wall; or (b2) the drag force dissipates all the energy of the particle.\nWe now obtain the equation for case (b1). Note, however, that case (b2) (dissipation\nof all the particle\u2019s energy) is completely encompassed by the equations obtained for\n(b1). After leaving the collision area, the particle travels to the right, i.e. towards the\nfixed wall located at x = l, suffers an elastic collision and is reflected back towards the\nmoving wall. During this part of its trajectory, both the velocity and position of the\nparticle are described by Eqs. (2) and (3). We thus need to evaluate the velocity of the\nparticle and corresponding time immediately before it re-enters the collision area. The\ntime spent in this part of its trajectory is easily obtained by evaluation of Eq. (3) taking\ninto consideration that xp = 2l \u2212 \u03b5. We then find that\ntT = \u2212\n1\n\u03b7\nln\n[\n1\u2212\n\u03b7\nvn\n[2l \u2212 \u03b5\u2212 \u03b5 cos(\u03c9tn)]\n]\n. (6)\nEq. (6) is real only if vn > \u03b7[2l \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 cos(\u03c9tn)]. For the condition vn \u2264 \u03b7[2l \u2212\n\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 cos(\u03c9tn)] we can conclude that case (b2) occurs, i.e. the drag force has already\ndissipated all of the energy of the particle. Consequently the particle has come to rest.\nIf the velocity of the particle satisfies Eq. (6), then it re-enters the collision area and will\ncertainly suffer another collision with the moving wall. Its velocity for t = tT is obtained\nfrom Eq. (2) taking the negative direction because the particle has been reflected by the\nfixed wall located at x = l. It is given by\nvp(tT ) = \u2212vn + 2\u03b7l \u2212 \u03b7\u03b5[1 + cos(\u03c9tn)] . (7)\nThe time at which the particle suffers a collision with the moving wall is obtained from\ncondition xp(tn+ tT + t) = xw(tn+ tT + t). It then leads to the following transcendental\nequation\nf(tc) = \u03b5 cos[\u03c9(tn + tT + tc)]\u2212 \u03b5\u2212\n(\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7tc\n) [vp(tT )\n\u03b7\n]\n, (8)\nwhere tc is the smallest solution of f(tc) for tc \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0\/\u03c9]. The map is then written as\nTns :\n{\nvn+1 = \u2212vp(tT )e\n\u2212\u03b7tc \u2212 2\u03b5\u03c9 sin(tn+1)\ntn+1 = tn + tT + tc\n(9)\nThe index \u201cns\u201d denotes the non-successive collisions. It is an advantage to change\nto dimensionless variables. We thus define Vn = vn\/(\u03c9l), \u03b4 = \u03b7\/\u03c9, \u01eb = \u03b5\/l and also\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 6\nmeasure time in terms of the number of oscillations of the moving wall, i.e. \u03c6n = \u03c9tn.\nUsing these variables, the mapping for the general case may then be rewritten as\nT :\n{\nVn+1 = V\n\u2217\nn e\n\u2212\u03b4\u03c6c \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n +\u2206Tn mod2\u03c0\n, (10)\nwhere V \u2217n and \u2206Tn are given by different expressions according to the following\nconditions:\n(1) Successive collision. In this case \u2206Tn = \u03c6c and V\n\u2217\nn = \u2212Vn. The term \u03c6c is obtained\nas the smallest solution of the function G(\u03c6c) in the interval \u03c6c \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0], given by\nG(\u03c6c) = \u01eb cos(\u03c6n + \u03c6c)\u2212 \u01eb cos(\u03c6n) +\nV \u2217n\n\u03b4\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b4\u03c6c) . (11)\n(2) Indirect collision. For this case we have that \u2206Tn = \u03c6T + \u03c6c and V\n\u2217\nn =\nVn \u2212 2\u03b4 + \u03b4\u01eb(1 + cos(\u03c6n)). The term \u03c6T is given by\n\u03c6T = \u2212\n1\n\u03b4\nln\n[\n1\u2212\n\u03b4\nVn\n[2\u2212 \u01eb\u2212 \u01eb cos(\u03c6n)]\n]\n,\nwhile the term \u03c6c is obtained as the smallest solution of the function F (\u03c6c) in the\ninterval \u03c6c \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], given by\nF (\u03c6c) = \u01eb cos(\u03c6n + \u03c6T + \u03c6c)\u2212 \u01eb+\nV \u2217n\n\u03b4\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b4\u03c6c) . (12)\nAs a consequence of the drag force, the expression for the Jacobian matrix differs from\nthat in the non-dissipative version. After some algebra, it is possible to show\n\u2022 That for the successive collisions (case (1)), we have\ndet Jcv = e\n\u2212\u03b4\u03c6c\n[\nVn + \u01eb sin(\u03c6n)\nVn+1 + \u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)\n]\n. (13)\n\u2022 And that, for case (2)\ndet Jcv = e\n\u2212\u03b4\u03c6c\n[\nVn + \u01eb sin(\u03c6n)\nVn+1 + \u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)\n] [\n1\u2212\n\u03b4\nVn\n[2\u2212 \u01eb\u2212 \u01eb cos(\u03c6n)]\n]\n.(14)\nThe index \u201ccv\u201d denotes the complete version. It is interesting to emphasize that\nin the conservative case, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is det J = (Vn +\n\u01eb sin(\u03c6n))\/(Vn+1 + \u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)), as can be seen in Ref. [10, 43]. Moreover, we can\nimmediately see that Eqs. (13) and (14) both imply a contracting area in the phase\nspace. It is also easy to see, however, that in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0 for the drag coefficient,\nEqs. (13) and (14) both lead to recovery of the result of the FUM. For that limit of \u03b4,\nit can also be considered as a particular case of the breathing circle in which a particle\nis bouncing in diametrical orbits [44].\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 7\n2.1. Numerical results for the complete version of the problem\nWe discuss in this section our numerical results for the complete version of the problem.\nAs we have shown, the Jacobian indicates the property of area-contraction. It is thus\nto be expected that, as time evolves and the drag force dissipates the energy of the\nparticle, either of two different things may occur: (i) the particle may be \u201ccaptured\u201d by\nan attracting region (fixed point) related to the corresponding KAM islands in the non-\ndissipative case, and then approaches the fixed point asymptotically. Such capture\ndepends on how close the particle passes to the attracting region; or (ii) the drag\nforce dissipates all the energy of the particle, bringing it to rest. Before discussing\nthe behaviour of the velocity as a function of iteration number, we first investigate it\nanalytically. For high velocity, V \u226b 2\u01eb and \u03b4 \u226a \u01eb, so that we can rewrite the expression\n(10) for the velocity as\nVn+1 \u223c= Vn \u2212 2\u03b4 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1) , (15)\nwhere we have considered the product \u03b4\u01eb to be negligible. Extending this approximation\nto the exponential, we note that the maximum value of \u03c6c is \u03c6c = 2\u01eb\/Vn. In the limit\nof V \u226b 2\u01eb and \u03b4 \u226a \u01eb, the expression e\u2212\u03b4\u03c6c \u2192 1. We can then rewrite the iterated Eq.\n(15) as\nV1 = V0 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c61)\u2212 2\u03b4\nV2 = V0 \u2212 2\u01eb[sin(\u03c61) + sin(\u03c62)]\u2212 4\u03b4\nV3 = V0 \u2212 2\u01eb[sin(\u03c61) + sin(\u03c62) + sin(\u03c63)]\u2212 6\u03b4\nand then the general expression as\nVn = V0 \u2212 2\u01eb\nn\u2211\ni=1\nsin \u03c6i \u2212 2n\u03b4. (16)\nEq. (16) tells us that the velocity of the particle decreases linearly as the iteration\nnumber increases. However, even supposing that \u03c6 were uniformly distributed in\n\u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), so that the condition yielded 2\u01eb\n\u2211m\ni=1 sin\u03c6i = 0, we would still expect\nthe velocity to oscillate sinusoidally for a short range of collision with the moving wall,\n\u201cn\u201d, as it decreases. Such an oscillation is clearly evident in Fig. 1 (see part (b)) which\nplots the calculated velocity as a function of n with the control parameters \u01eb = 1\u00d710\u22123,\n\u03b4 = 1 \u00d7 10\u22125, for the initial condition V0 = 3 and \u03c60 = 0. Fig. 1(a) shows that the\nlinear decrease in velocity persists over a large range of n, and Fig. 1(b) shows the\noscillatory velocity on an expanded ordinate scale for a short range of n. A linear fit\ngives us a linear coefficient of \u22122\u00d7 10\u22125, which is in complete accord with Eq. (16). It\nis interesting to emphasize that, when the drag coefficient \u03b4 \u2192 0, the last term in Eq.\n(16) disappears. The invariant spanning curves then become stable and the velocity of\nthe particle does not decrease as the dynamics evolves. Moreover, this result is in fact\nin perfect agreement with that obtained from the determinant of the Jacobian matrix in\nthe limit \u03b4 \u2192 0. In this limit, we have the condition of phase space measure preservation\nand thus the results for the non-dissipative FUM are all recovered.\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 8\n0 30000 60000 90000\nn\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\nV\nNumerical Data\nLinear Fit\n0 15 30 45\nn\n2.994\n2.996\n2.998\n3\nV\na\nb\nFigure 1.

Part (b) is plotted on expanded scales\nto illustrate the oscillatory behaviour.\nNow suppose that the particle is captured by an attracting region. We will describe\nhow it approaches the attracting fixed point as a function of iteration number. We shall\nconsider the attracting region as being in some sense equivalent to the first KAM island\nfor the non-dissipative model (cf. Table 1 for the non-dissipative simplified model and\nFig. 4 for its dissipative version) although other regions could also be considered. In\norder to investigate the asymptotic approach to the attracting fixed point, we first define\na set of initial conditions and then allow the system to evolve in time. We establish\na convergency criterion in order to define the asymptotic approach to the attracting\nfixed point. The criterion consists in verifying the distance of the particle from the\nfixed point. We thus define a circle of radius rc = 10\n\u22126 and iterate each set of initial\ncondition. If the particle is near enough to the fixed point, say less then rc, we then\nsave, in an array, the corresponding number of collisions spent until that point and thus\nstart a different initial condition.

Fig. 2(a) shows the behaviour of the average number of collisions\nwith the moving wall, n\u00afx as function of proximity to the fixed point for a set of\ntrajectories approaching it. The horizontal axis represents how far the trajectory\nis from the fixed point, a distance defined as r =\n\u221a\n(Vn \u2212 V \u2217)2 + (\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6\u2217)2. The\ncoordinates of the fixed point are represented by (V \u2217, \u03c6\u2217). The error bars denotes the\nstandard deviation of a set of 500 different initial conditions in the range (V0, \u03c60) =\n([0.325, 0.33], \u03c0). Each curve in Fig. 2(a) is fitted by the function n\u00afx(r) = A +B ln(r).\nFor \u03b4 = 1\u00d7 10\u22124, we obtain A = \u221214.6(1)\u00d7 103 and B = \u22123.22(1)\u00d7 103. For the case\nwhere \u03b4 = 5\u00d7 10\u22124 we have A = \u221229.72(2)\u00d7 103, B = \u22126.376(2)\u00d7 103 and finally, for\n\u03b4 = 1\u00d710\u22125, the coefficients are A = \u2212149.1(3)\u00d7103 and B = \u221231.77(3)\u00d7103. Results\nlike those in Fig. 2(a) allow us to conclude that the trajectory approaches the fixed point\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 10\nexponentially as the collisions with the moving wall evolves. We can also investigate\nhow the trajectory evolves towards an attracting fixed point as function of the drag\ncoefficient. Fig. 2(b) shows the behaviour of n\u00afx as function of the drag coefficient where\nwe have evolved the simulation up to r < 10\u22126. We can then describe such behaviour\nas\nn\u00afx \u221d \u03b4\n\u00b5 . (17)\nAfter doing a power law fit as those shown in Fig. 2(b) we obtain \u00b5 = \u22121.000(2). It\nis easy to see that, in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, Eq. (17) gives us that n\u00afx \u2192 \u221e. Note however\nthat, in this limit of \u03b4, preservation of the phase space measure must be recovered. We\nconclude that two different things can occur, depending on the initial conditions: (i) the\nparticle may display periodic, or at least quasi-periodic, behaviour; or (ii) the particle\nmay exhibit chaotic behaviour. The result n\u00afx \u2192 \u221e could be interpreted as indicating\nthat convergence to an attracting fixed point does not occur.\n3. A simplified version of the dissipative FUM\nNext, we describe a modified form of our dissipative FUM that we refer to as its simplified\nversion [45]. We will suppose that both walls are fixed but that, after the particle\nsuffers a collision with one of them, it exchanges momentum as if the wall was moving.\nSimplifications of this kind were found very useful for speeding up numerical simulations\ntwo or three decades ago, when computers were far slower. Such an approach is also\nuseful in facilitating the analytic treatment. It also enables us to seek generic behaviour\nthat can subsequently be sought in the complete version of the model.\nSeveral recent works have used such simplifications to describe the dynamical\nproperties of two-dimensional maps. For example, scaling arguments have been used [46]\nto characterize the chaotic sea at low energy for the simplified FUM. One of the tools\nemployed in investigating the model, the roughness, was derived from surface science\n[47] and the formalism proposed in [46] could usefully be applied to billiards. In [43],\nthe authors used the simplified version of the FUM to provide a careful description of\nthe lowest energy invariant spanning curve and its location. The results are in principle\nextendable to the complete version of the model. Furthermore, we have used a similarly\nsimplified version of the hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model [10] to predict the existence\nof invariant spanning curves below the chaotic sea in the low energy region. We were\nsubsequently able to use the corresponding complete version for observing such curves.\nThe hybrid model in question behaves neither purely as a FUM, nor as a bouncer, but\nas a combination of these two. Simplifications of this kind have also been found useful\nin relation to the problem of rippled channels [48, 49, 50].\nFor the non-dissipative case, the complete and simplified versions present closely\nsimilar results except at very low energies, typically V \u223c= 2\u01eb. In this limit it is possible\nto observe in the complete model a set of successive collisions that are absent in\nthe simplified version. As we will discuss, the introduction of this simplification into\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 11\nour dissipative model yields significantly different asymptotic behaviour for the region\nrelated to the fixed points. If we then consider that both walls are fixed, we immediately\nsee that successive collisions that are allowed in the complete model cannot occur in the\nsimplified one. In the complete model, depending on the combination of velocity and\nphase, it is possible for the particle, after suffering a collision with the moving wall, to\nsuffer a second successive collision before exiting the collision area, as well as possibly\nhaving a negative velocity following the first such collision. In the simplified model, non-\npositive velocities are forbidden because they are equivalent to the particle travelling\nbeyond the wall. In order to avoid such problems, if after the collision the particle has a\nnegative velocity, we inject it back with the same modulus of velocity. Such a procedure\nis effected perfectly by use of a modulus function. Note that the velocity of the particle\nis reversed by the modulus function only if, after the collision, the particle remains\ntravelling in the negative direction. The module function has no effect on the motion of\nthe particle if it moves in the positive direction after the collision. We stress that this\napproximation is valid only for small values of \u01eb. Moreover, it is no longer necessary to\nsolve both of the functions F (\u03c6c) and G(\u03c6c). Incorporating these simplifications, the\nmap can then be written as\nT :\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3 Vn+1 = |Vn \u2212 2\u03b4 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)|\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n \u2212 1\u03b4 ln\n[\n1\u2212 2\u03b4\nVn\n]\nmod2\u03c0\n. (18)\nThe phase \u03c6n+1 is real only if Vn > 2\u03b4. If Vn \u2264 2\u03b4, we can conclude that the particle\ndoes not have enough energy for a further collision. Therefore the particle comes to\nrest. We then obtain the expression of the Jacobian matrix for this map (18), which\ntakes the form\nJsv =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u2202\u03c6n+1\u2202\u03c6n \u2202\u03c6n+1\u2202Vn\n\u2202Vn+1\n\u2202\u03c6n\n\u2202Vn+1\n\u2202Vn\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (19)\nwith coefficients given by\n\u2202\u03c6n+1\n\u2202\u03c6n\n= 1 ,\n\u2202\u03c6n+1\n\u2202Vn\n= \u2212\n2\nV 2n \u2212 2\u03b4Vn\n\u2202Vn+1\n\u2202\u03c6n\n= sign [Vn \u2212 2\u03b4 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)]\n[\n\u22122\u01eb cos(\u03c6n+1)\n\u2202\u03c6n+1\n\u2202\u03c6n\n]\n\u2202Vn+1\n\u2202Vn\n= sign [Vn \u2212 2\u03b4 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)]\n[\n1\u2212 2\u01eb cos(\u03c6n+1)\n\u2202\u03c6n+1\n\u2202Vn\n]\n,\nwhere the function sign(u) = 1 if u > 0 and sign(u) = \u22121 if u < 0. The index \u201csv\u201d\ndenotes the simplified version.\nA careful investigation of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix (Eq. (19)) shows\nthat det Jsv = sign [Vn \u2212 2\u03b4 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)]. This result tell us that, in contrast to the\ncomplete model, it is possible to observe regions of phase space where the area-preserving\nproperty is satisfied. As we will show, however, this result is not applicable throughout\nthe whole of phase space.\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 12\n3.1. Properties of the non-dissipative simplified FUM\nBefore considering the connections between the dissipative and non-dissipative cases,\nlet us briefly discuss some properties of the simplified FUM [45] without dissipation.\nConsidering the case in which a particle bounces elastically between two rigid walls in\nabsence of a drag force and using the optimal variables, the map describing the dynamics\nof the simplified FUM is given by{\nVn+1 = |Vn \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)|\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n +\n2\nVn\nmod2\u03c0\n. (20)\nThe phase space for this system exhibits KAM islands surrounded by a chaotic sea\nthat is limited by an invariant spanning curve in the low energy domain. For high\nenergy, it shows basically a set of invariant spanning curves. As discussed in [43],\nthe position of the lowest energy invariant spanning curve can be rescaled for different\ncontrol parameters and connected to the Standard Map (SM) to appear for the same\neffective control parameter (KFU \u2248 0.97 . . .) at which the SM undergoes a change from\nlocally to globally stochastic behaviour [51].

Connection between the dissipative and non-dissipative cases\nThe dissipative model must go over into the non-dissipative one when the drag coefficient\n\u03b4 \u2192 0. In this case it is easy to see that the first equation of map (18) recovers the first\nequation of map (20), i.e.\nVn+1 = lim\n\u03b4\u21920\n|Vn \u2212 2\u03b4 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)|\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 13\nyielding\nVn+1 = |Vn \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1)| .\nConsidering the second equation of map (18), we obtain\n\u03c6n+1 = lim\n\u03b4\u21920\n(\n\u03c6n \u2212\n1\n\u03b4\nln\n[\n1\u2212\n2\u03b4\nVn\n])\n. (21)\nIn order to apply the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, we must first expand Eq. (21), yielding\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n + lim\n\u03b4\u21920\n[\n2\nVn\n+\n2\u03b4\nV 2n\n+\n16\n3!\n\u03b42\nV 3n\n+ . . .\n]\n.\nApplication of the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0 then gives us that\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n +\n2\nVn\n,\nwhich is in perfect agreement with the map (20).\nIt is also interesting to characterize how the fixed points of our dissipative model\ngo over to the fixed points of the non-dissipative model. It is well known that the fixed\npoints and periodic orbits are obtained by requiring that the conditions \u03c6n+i = \u03c6n and\nVn+i = Vn be satisfied. The periodicity of the orbit is given by the label i, so i = 1\nimplies a period-one orbit, i = 2 gives a period-two orbit and so on. Applying the\ncondition to obtain a period-one fixed point for both the equations of map (18), we\nobtain\nVn+1 = Vn \u2212 2\u03b4 \u2212 2\u01eb sin(\u03c6n+1) = Vn (22)\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n \u2212\n1\n\u03b4\nln\n[\n1\u2212\n2\u03b4\nVn\n]\n= \u03c6n. (23)\nEq. (22) yields\nVn =\n2\u03b4\n1\u2212 e\u22122pi\u03b4i\nwith i = 1, 2, 3 . . . (24)\nand then Eq. (23) gives us that\n\u03c6n = 2\u03c0 \u2212 arcsin(\u03b4\/\u01eb) , (25)\n\u03c6n = \u03c0 + arcsin(\u03b4\/\u01eb) . (26)\nEqs. (25) and (26) are both real for \u03b4\/\u01eb \u2264 1. We can use the coefficients of the Jacobian\nmatrix (see Eq. (19)) and analyze the stability of the period-one fixed point. We then\nproceed as follows: (i) the fixed point given by Eqs. (24) and (25) can be classified as\nhyperbolic for all values of the control parameters \u01eb and \u03b4 with condition \u03b4\/\u01eb \u2264 1; (ii)\nfor the fixed point given by Eqs. (24) and (26) we define an auxiliary variable as\n\u01eb\u2217 =\n4\u03b42e\u22122pi\u03b4i\ncos(arcsin(\u03b4\/\u01eb)) [1\u2212 e\u22122pi\u03b4i]2\n, (27)\nand then use it to classify such a fixed point as: (a) elliptic if \u01eb < \u01eb\u2217; (b) parabolic if\n\u01eb = \u01eb\u2217; and finally (c) hyperbolic if \u01eb > \u01eb\u2217.\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 14\nIt is expected however that, in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, the fixed points given by Eqs. (24),\n(25) and (26) and Eq. (27) must reproduce the results presented in Table 1. Applying\nthe limit for Eq. (24) we obtain\nVn = lim\n\u03b4\u21920\n2\u03b4\n1\u2212 e\u22122pi\u03b4i\n(28)\nVn = lim\n\u03b4\u21920\n2\n2\u03c0ie\u22122pi\u03b4i\n, (29)\nwhich yields\nVn =\n1\n\u03c0i\nwith i = 1, 2, 3 . . . . (30)\nWe have used L\u2019Hospital\u2019s rule [52] in going from Eq. (28) to (29). Applying the limit\n\u03b4 \u2192 0 for the Eqs. (25) and (26) we have that\n\u03c6n = 2\u03c0 \u2212 lim\n\u03b4\u21920\narcsin(\u03b4\/\u01eb) = 2\u03c0 , (31)\n\u03c6n = \u03c0 + lim\n\u03b4\u21920\narcsin(\u03b4\/\u01eb) = \u03c0 . (32)\nWe can readily see that Eqs. (30), (31) and (32) are all in complete agreement with\nTable 1. Equation (31) is in fact defined as mod 2\u03c0. The same result is also valid for Eq.\n(27) where, after applying L\u2019Hospital\u2019s rule three times in succession and evaluating for\n\u03b4 \u2192 0, we obtain\n\u01eb\u2217 =\n1\n\u03c02i2\n, (33)\nwhich is also in agreement with Table 1.\n3.3. Numerical results for the simplified dissipative FUM\nWe discuss in this section our numerical results for the simplified version of the model.\nIterating the expression for the velocity given by the map (18), we obtain again the same\nequation (16) as for the complete model. It may thus be expected that, at high energy,\nthe velocity of the particle decreases linearly on average, while oscillating sinusoidally as\nit decreases. Unlike the complete version, however, stable KAM islands with invariant\ncurves are observed. Such curves act effectively as barriers that do not allow the flux\nof particles to pass through them. Fig. 3(a) shows the behaviour of the velocity as\nfunction of iteration number. For high energy, the velocity of the particle decreases\nlinearly, and a linear fit yields a coefficient of \u22121.9990(7) \u00d7 10\u22125 as predicted by Eq.\n(16). The expanded region of Fig. 3(a) illustrates the passage of the particle near to the\ninvariant KAM curve delimiting the region related to the fixed point given by Eqs. (24)\nwith i = 1 and (26). Fig. 3(b) shows a KAM curve (solid line) and the evolution of an\ninitial condition near to the KAM curve (open circles connected by a dotted line as a\nguide to the eye). For visual clarity, we have only plotted every 4th point: i.e. between\neach two successive points connected by the dotted line there are another three that\nwere not plotted.

(b) Details of a trajectory passing near to a KAM island, plotting V (n) as a\nfunction of the phase \u03c6.\nThe stable regions for the simplified version of our model are shown in Fig. 4. As\nexpected, the KAM curves are surrounding an elliptic fixed point that is represented as\na dot in Fig. 4. The parameters used in Fig. 4 were \u01eb = 1\u00d7 10\u22123 and \u03b4 = 1\u00d7 10\u22125. For\nthis combination of control parameters, the period-one elliptic fixed points are stable\nfor i \u2264 10. Moreover, outside these KAM curves, the particle behaves quite differently.\nWe have shown that, in the regime of high energy, the velocity of the particle decreases\nlinearly as iteration number increases. It passes around the stable KAM islands (see\nFig. 3(b)) and then wanders chaotically in the low energy domain for a number of\niterations. However, in the non-dissipative case, it is possible for the particle to have\nvery low values of velocity within the so-called chaotic sea. It can assume low values in\nthis version of the model too but, for the case where Vn \u2264 2\u03b4, the particle has insufficient\nenergy to return to the wall for its next kick, and it therefore comes to rest.\nWe now characterize this relaxation time for the simplified model in the low energy\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 16\n0 2 4 6\u03c6\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nV\ni=1\ni=2\ni=3\ni=4\ni=5\ni=6i=7 i=8i=9\ni=10\nFigure 4.

To do so, we will evaluate the time evolution of an ensemble of different\ninitial conditions in the regime of low energy. We will take different points uniformly\ndistributed in the chaotic sea for the non-dissipative case as initial conditions, and then\nstudy their asymptotic evolution in the dissipative case. However, as the drag force can\ncause some modifications to the form of the phase space, it is possible for some regions of\nthe chaotic sea in the non-dissipative case to yield periodic or quasi-periodic behaviour\nin the dissipative version. If we then take an initial condition that leads to periodic or\neven quasi-periodic behaviour in the dissipative model, it is disregarded and a different\ninitial condition is then considered.

These results allow us to describe the transient as\nn\u00afx \u221d \u03b4\n\u00b5 , (34)\nwhere a power law fit gives us the exponent \u00b5 = \u22120.973(5) \u2248 \u22121, which seems to be the\nsame as that obtained in the complete model for a particle approaching the fixed point.\nNote however that, as discussed in the previous section for a fixed point convergence\n(see Eq. (17)), Eq. (34) diverges in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0. We can still conclude that in this\nlimit of \u03b4 and as a consequence of the divergence of n\u00afx, the dynamics for such a region is\nin fact chaotic. It is also interesting to emphasize that all the invariant spanning curves\nare now stable in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, a result that, in a sense, limits the size of the chaotic\nsea.\nWe now discuss why the area-preserving property is not applicable over the whole\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 18\nphase space of the simplified version of our model. We have shown that, for high\nenergy, the velocity of the particle decreases linearly as the iteration number evolves.\nThis behaviour brings the particle to the region where the chaotic transient is observed.\nHowever, as we have previously discussed, the particle experiencing a chaotic transient\nmay assume very low velocity values. Moreover, the equations defining the map (see\nEq. (18)) are restricted (defined for real numbers) to the condition Vn > 2\u03b4. Thus, if\nthe particle acquires a velocity Vn \u2264 2\u03b4, the phase \u03c6n+1 is not defined as a real number,\ncorresponding to the particle having insufficient energy for a further collision. As an\nimmediate consequence, the dynamics of the system is over. Note however that the\ncondition Vn \u2264 2\u03b4 breaks down the property of area preservation, since the map is\nundefined for that range of Vn. Moreover, for the stable KAM islands that surround the\nelliptic fixed points (see Fig. 4), the particle does not assume these velocities Vn \u2264 2\u03b4.\nOnce within this region (KAM islands) for which the phase \u03c6 is real for all values of the\nvelocity, then area preservation applies.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have studied the FUM in the presence of a drag force, described by use of a two-\ndimensional map obtained via the solution of differential equations. The complete\nversion of the model is area-contracting and we have characterized the time evolution\nof the velocity in the regime of high energy, where it seems to decreases linearly as the\niteration number increase. In the regime of low energy, the particle may be captured\nby an attracting region, or can come to rest once all its energy has been dissipated\nby the drag force. If the particle is captured by an attracting region, it approaches the\nfixed point exponentially as the iteration number increases. We show that the simplified\nmodel possesses some regions in its phase space where the property of area-preservation\nis observed, exhibiting stable KAM islands. For high energy, the behaviour of the\nvelocity seems to be the same as in the complete model. However, in the low energy\nregime, and outside the KAM islands, the particle relaxes via a chaotic transient that\ndepends on the strength of the drag coefficient.\nFinally, we comment on the relationship between the simplified and full FUMs. It\nis well known that the simplified version of the non-dissipative FUM yields qualitatively\nvery similar results to those obtained from the complete model. We have shown in this\npaper, however, that in the presence of a drag force, the simplified model yields results\nthat are entirely different from those of the complete version within certain regions of\nthe phase space. In particular, the simplified model possesses regions in its phase space\nwhere the property of area preservation is observed, a result that does not arise in the\ncomplete version.\nEffect of a frictional force on the Fermi-Ulam model 19\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a grant from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento\nCient\u00b4\u0131fico e Tecnolo\u00b4gico \u2013 CNPq, Brazilian agency.
