First, we derive an analytic solution of the stability problem in the longwave limit which shows that\nthe presence of the ice layer generates an additional wave mode. Further, using a longwave solution as an\ninitial guess, we find the additional wave mode in the numerical solution of the complete Orr-Sommerfeld\nproblem and investigate its behavior numerically for a wide range of problem parameters. We show that\nthe ice mode can become unstable even at moderate Reynolds numbers, and that the ice layer alters\nthe behavior of the mode corresponding to the waves on the liquid film surface. We also demonstrate\nthat the presence of the ice layer stabilizes wave disturbances on the water surface and that, depending\non the angle of the incline, the critical Reynolds number of the surface mode can be either increased or\ndecreased.\n\u2217Department of Aerospace Sciences, Cranfield University, UK\n\u2020Department of Mathematics, University College London, UK\n1\n1 Introduction\nThe study we present in this paper was initially motivated by the experimental results reported by Streitz\nand Ettema1, who performed a series of experiments on the development of an ice layer under a water film\nflowing down an inclined plane. The dynamics of ice growth suggested that the ice surface might become\nunstable under certain conditions. The development of the ice surface in this flow bears resemblance to the\nice-band structures observed experimentally in the pipe flows by Gilpin2,3 and Seki et al.4.\nMorphological instabilities of the solidification front have been studied extensively in relation to con-\ncentration field driven casting problems5,6,7. In these problems, the interaction between the flow field and\nthe morphological instability of the solidification front can cause growth and upstream propagation of the\nsolidification front disturbances. For water film flows an asymptotic triple-deck theory was developed by\nRothmayer and Tsao8,9,10 in order to analyze ice formation on an airfoil at large Reynolds numbers. They\nfound that the ice front can become unstable under the conditions of simultaneous cooling of both air and\nairfoil surface. In another work11, the same authors have demonstrated successful comparisons betwen the\ntriple-deck theory and experimental observations.\nA number of researchers studied the stability of gravity-driven water film flow on a sloping wall, starting\nwith a pioneering work by Yih12. In the longwave limit, the linear stability problem for this flow can\nbe solved analytically12. This provides, in conjunction with several numerical studies13,14,15, an excellent\nstarting point for the analysis of the icing instability and the ice layer influence on the other modes present\nin the flow, namely the Tollmien-Schlichting and surface waves.\nFurthermore, in the triple-deck of Rothmayer and Tsao9 icing instability is observed for supercooled\nwater, whereas for water film flow on a sloping wall with air temperature above freezing there exists a steady\nstate solution of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations, which makes it possible to perform a linear stability\nanalysis in a consistent manner.\nIn this paper we analyze the flow of water film down an inclined plane where the temperature of the\nplane is below freezing and the temperature of the water surface is above freezing. We formulate a linear\nstability problem for the flow and derive an analytic solution in the longwave limit. Using this solution, we\nshow that an additional mode appears in the problem and demonstrate that this mode is associated with the\npresence of the ice layer. Then we proceed to analyze the behavior of this mode using numerical solution of\nthe linear stability problem for order-one wave numbers and show that this mode becomes unstable under\ncertain conditions. It is worth noting, that phase speed of the icing instability mode described in this paper\nis always negative when this mode is unstable.\nForth and Wheeler6 demonstrated that for the casting problems in the boundary layer flow, the effect of\n2\nthe solidification front on the hydrodynamic stability (shear instability in their case) is very weak because\nof the mismatch in the characteristic length scales involved. However for the flow down an inclined plane,\nthe neutral curve of the surface mode includes the Reynolds number axis12. Therefore the flow is unstable\nto arbitrarily long wave disturbances for any Reynolds number exceeding some critical value. In the long\nwave limit there is no mismatch between the solidification front length scale and surface waves length scale\nand the ice layer has a potential to influence the other wave modes present in the flow. We investigate this\neffect and demonstrate using first our longwave analytic solution and then numerical solution of the complete\nlinear stability problem that the ice layer stabilizes water surface mode in the longwave limit and affects its\ncritical Reynolds number.\n2 Nonlinear problem\nThe flow of water down an inclined plane maintained at a temperature below freezing is governed by Navier-\nStokes system of equations coupled with heat transfer equations in water and ice layers.\nLet us use superscript \"*\" to denote values with dimensions, and subscripts L and I to refer to the\nproperties of liquid layer and ice sheet respectively.\nIn order to simplify comparison with the flow without ice formation, we use nondimensionalization\nadopted in Floryan et al.15. We take the thickness of the unperturbed film h\u2217 as the characteristic length and\nwrite the characteristic velocity in terms of the acceleration due to gravity g\u2217 and the angle of the plane with\nthe horizontal \u03c6, as U\u2217 = g\u2217h\u22172 sin\u03c6\/(2\u03bd\u2217L). Here \u03bd\u2217L denotes kinematic viscosity of liquid. The characteris-\ntic time is then given by h\u2217\/U\u2217. The characteristic pressure is P \u2217 = \u00b5\u2217LU\u2217\/h\u2217, where \u00b5\u2217L denotes dynamic\nviscosity of liquid. We define dimensionless temperature as T = (T \u2217 \u2212 T \u2217F )\/DT where DT = T \u2217A \u2212 T \u2217F is\nthe characteristic temperature scale, T \u2217F denotes the freezing temperature and T \u2217A denotes the temperature\nof the surrounding air, which is assumed to be constant. The origin of the coordinate system is placed at\nthe unperturbed free surface, with y-axis pointing downward into the liquid layer and the x-axis pointing\nin the direction of the base flow (see Figure 1). In the scope of this paper we consider consider ice surface\ndevelopment at water time-scale, and characteristic time is given by t = h\u2217U\u2217 . Note that another approach\ncan be constructed by considering problem at ice time-scale16.\nUsing these characteristic values and usual notation for velocity and pressure, the governing system of\nequations can be written in nondimensional form as\n3\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nD~V\nDt = \u2212\u2207p+ 1Re 4 ~V + 1Fr~g\nD ~TL\nDt =\n1\nRePr 4 TL\n\u2202TI\n\u2202t =\n\u03c7IL\nRePr 4 TI\n(1)\nwhere \u03c7IL = \u03c7I\/\u03c7L is the ratio of thermal diffusivities and ~ng indicates the direction of acceleration due\nto gravity g. The Reynolds number is given by Re = h\u22173g\u2217 sin\u03c6\/(2\u03bd\u22172L ), the Prandtl number by Pr = \u03bd\u2217L\/\u03c7\u2217L\nand the Froude number by Fr = 4\u03bd\u22172L \/(g\u2217h\u22173sin2\u03c6).\nLet the position of the free surface be given by equation F (x, y, t) = 0 and the position of the ice surface\nby H (x, y, t) = 0. Then boundary conditions at the free surface are given by kinematic condition, stress\nbalance condition and constant temperature condition\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n~V \u00b7 \u2207F = \u2212\u2202F\u2202t(\n\u2212p \u00b7 \u03b4ij +\n(\n\u2202Vi\n\u2202xj\n+ \u2202Vj\u2202xi\n))\n\u00b7 nFj + ReWe\u03banFi = 0\nTL = 1\n(2)\nwhere nFi denotes components of the unit normal vector to the free surface,We = \u03c1\u2217Lg\u22172h\u22175sin2\u03c6\/(4S\u2217\u03bd\u22172l )\nis the Weber number, S\u2217 is the surface tension coefficient and \u03ba is the curvature of the free surface.\nBoundary conditions at the ice surface are given by the kinematic condition adjusted to account for\nthe volume change accompanying phase change, Stefan condition17 representing energy conservation and\nconstant freezing temperature condition\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u2212\u2192\nV \u00b7 \u2207H = \u2212\u0398IL \u00b7 \u2202H\u2202t\n\u03bbIL\n\u2202TI\n\u2202 ~nH\n\u2212 \u2202TL\n\u2202 ~nH\n= RePrSt\n\u2212\u2192\nV \u00b7 \u2212\u2192nF\nTL = TI = 0\n(3)\nwhere ~nH denotes the unit normal vector to the ice surface, \u0398IL = 1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2217I\/\u03c1\u2217L is a positive constant\ninvolving only the densities of the ice (\u03c1\u2217I) and water (\u03c1\u2217L) and \u03bbIL = \u03bb\u2217I\/\u03bb\u2217L is the ratio of ice thermal\nconductivity to water thermal conductivity. Stefan number is defined as St = Cp\u2217LDT\/H\u2217LI using water\nspecific heat Cp\u2217L and latent heat of the phase change H\u2217LI . Quantitative estimates performed in this paper\nare based on Cp\u2217L = 4218J\/kg \u00b7K and H\u2217LI = 333.4kJ\/kg (see, for example17,18).\nAt solid wall we assume constant temperature TW\nTI = TW = const (4)\nNote that Eqs. (1) do not include the effect of buoyancy. In the Boussinesque approximation, the relative\n4\nmagnitude of buoyancy term to viscous term is given by\nR (DT, \u03c6) =\n2\u03b2DT\nsin (\u03c6)\n(5)\nwhere \u03b2 is the volumetric expansion coefficient of water. In our case we consider small variations of\ntemperature (DT < 5o) and the minimum angle of incline considered in this paper is equal 0.002. Using\nfourth order approximation for water density as a function of temperature19, we can estimate the maximum\nof R to be R (5, 0.002) = \u22120.079. Based on this estimate we have chosen to neglect buoyancy effects in all\ncases presented in this paper. However it is worth noting that for smaller angles of incline, bouyancy should\nbe included into the problem formulation.\n3 Linear stability problem\nConsider linear stability problem for the system of Eqs. (1) -(4). The base steady-state solution of Eqs.\n(1) -(4) independent of the x-coordinate is given by a half-parabolic velocity profile and linear temperature\ndistributions in both liquid and solid phases, which can be written as\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nu0(y) = 1\u2212 y2\nv0(y) = 0\np0(y) = 2y cot\u03c6\nT0L(y) = 1\u2212 y\nT0I(y) = TW y\u22121H0\u22121\n(6)\nwhere y = H0 gives the coordinate of the cold wall.\nUsing the normal modes method, we consider evolution of small traveling wave disturbances to the base\nflow (Eq. (6)) which are defined for each flow variable F as F (x, y, t) = F\u0302 (y) exp(i\u03b1(x \u2212 ct)), where \u03b1 is\nthe real wave number and c is the complex phase speed.

In addition, we require the temperature to be constant on the free surface which leads to the following\nequation\nT\u0302L \u2212 iv\u0302\n\u03b1(u0l \u2212 c)\ndT0L\ndy\n= 0 (10)\nAt the ice surface, we write the boundary conditions using expansion at the unperturbed position y = 1.\nThen the kinematic condition at the ice surface yields the following expression for the perturbation of the\nice surface, h\u0302,\nh\u0302 =\niv\u0302\n\u0398IL\u03b1c\n(11)\nUsing Eq.

Combining this with Eq. (16) we can eliminate the ice temperature from the Stefan condition\n(Eq.

(7) we discretize the equations and boundary conditions using a compact 4th order\naccurate finite-difference scheme derived in Shapiro and Timoshin20 for linear stability analysis of two-fluid\nchannel flows. Then, following21 we diagonalize the matrix of the resulting linear algebraic equations and\nseek the value of the complex phase speed which reduces the rank of this matrix. Once we have found the\nsolution for a mode at some point in the parametric space P 0 =\n(\n\u03b10, Re0,H00 , St\n0, \u03c60\n)\n, the root for this\nmode at some other point P 1 =\n(\n\u03b11, Re1,H10 , St\n1, \u03c61\n)\nis obtained by connecting these points with a line\nsegment in the parametric space and marching along this line with a suitably small step. At each step we\nuse results from the previous step as a guess value for the iterative algorithm. In what follows we refer to\nthis process as mode tracing.\nIn order to obtain the critical point P crit, in the (\u03b1,Re) plane, we look for the roots of dRe\/d\u03b1 = 0\nequation using Newton iterations. The second derivative d2Re\/d\u03b12 required for this procedure is computed\n7\nnumerically.\nIn order to test the proposed scheme, we note that if the boundary conditions at the ice surface are\nreplaced with the no-slip conditions corresponding to a fixed solid wall the temperature field becomes de-\ncoupled from the disturbance velocity and pressure. In this case the stability modes should be identical to\nthose in the flow down an inclined plane without ice. The results of our tests showed excellent agreement\nwith the data published by De Bruin13 and Floryan et al.15 for the flow down an inclined plane.\nFor the computations reported in this paper we use grids of 400 points in the y-direction for function\nplots and grids of 800 points in y for the computation of critical parameters.\n5 Longwave asymptotic solution\nFor a liquid film flow on an inclined flat plate, Yih12 derived an analytic solution in the long wave limit.\nIn this section we consider a similar problem in the presence of an ice layer. Apart from being of interest\nin its own right, the long wave asymptotic solution derived here is used as an initial approximation in the\nsubsequent sections where computations for the full stability problem are described. In order to facilitate\ncomparison with Yih12 we first rewrite Eq. (7) in terms of the stream function disturbance, \u03c8\u0302. Let \u03b1 \u2192 0\nand \u03c8\u0302 = O (1) in the Orr-Sommerfeld equations, and consider the following expansion f\u0302 = f\u03020 + \u03b1f\u03021 + ...\nfor all flow variables. Then, as \u03c8\u0302 = iv\u0302\/\u03b1, Eqs.

The longwave asymptotic solution is valid if \u03b1\u00bf 1 and \u03b1Re\u00bf 1. However\nin addition, we require that the coefficient at \u03c8\u0302 in the Stefan condition \u03b1RePr\/St \u223c 1. This condition is\nnecessary in order to retain the influence of the ice surface deformations in the limit formulation. Let\nus denote that coefficient by a and estimate the validity of these assumptions. For water near freezing\ntemperature Pr \u223c 10, also for characteristic temperature differences of order 1 Stefan number St \u223c 10\u22122 so\nthat a \u223c 103\u03b1Re. Therefore the assumption a \u223c 1 holds for \u03b1Re \u223c 10\u22123. Note when we assume a \u223c 1, for a\ngiven Reynolds number this imposes a window in \u03b1 in which the comparison between longwave asymptotics\nand full Orr-Sommerfeld solution can be performed.\nThe general solution of the system of Eq.

This yields the following\nquadratic equation for the complex phase speed c\n9\niac2(H0 \u2212 1)\u0398ILc2 \u2212 c(2ia\u0398IL(H0 \u2212 1) +H0 \u2212\u0398IL(H0 \u2212 1)) + 2 = 0 (24)\nFrom here, we obtain two distinct wave modes with the phase speeds given by\nc\u00b1 =\n(2ia\u0398IL(H0\u22121)+H0\u2212\u0398IL(H0\u22121))\u00b1\n4ia(H0\u22121)\u0398IL\u221a\n(2ia\u0398IL(H0\u22121)+H0\u2212\u0398IL(H0\u22121))2\u22128ia(H0\u22121)\u0398IL\n4ia(H0\u22121)\u0398IL\n(25)\nFor given media properties, the functions c\u00b1 (a) reflect the dependence of the phase speed on the wave\nnumber when the Reynolds number in the flow is kept constant. We can then use plots of this function\nfor varying initial ice layer height H0 (Figure 2) to illustrate the behavior of long waves. Both wave modes\nappear to be stable and when H0 \u2192 1, i.e. when the ice sheet vanishes, we have c = 2 as in Yih12 (with\na rescaling applied as a different normalization of the base-flow solution is taken here). Also both roots\nconverge to Yih's root when a\u2192 0 and \u0398IL \u2192 0, i.e. when the coupling between the energy and momentum\nequations vanishes.\nThus instead of one neutrally-stable surface mode as obtained by Yih12, the longwave stability formulation\nincluding ice\/water interaction provides two decaying modes. When these modes are used to provide an initial\nguess for the numerical solution of Orr-Sommerfeld formulation, it occurs that the longwave root c+ forms\na neutral curve for the surface waves whereas the root c\u2212 continues parametrically into a new mode of\ninstability which we will refer to as the ice mode.\nTo illustrate this correspondence we compare the behavior of the complex phase speed as a function\nof wave number for longwave roots with computed eigenvalues of the full Orr-Sommerfeld problem. The\ncomparisons are performed at a fixed angle of incline (\u03c6 = 0.002), Stefan number (St = 0.0625) and Prandtl\nnumber Pr = 13.47. The Orr-Sommerfeld solutions were computed at Re = 10000 for the undisturbed ice\nlayer height H0 = 10 with zero surface tension. Figure 3 shows imaginary and real parts of c\u00b1 and the\ncorresponding modes from the full Orr-Sommerfeld formulation. In Figures 3a,b the longwave mode c\u2212 is\nshown together with the ice mode obtained from the solution of the Orr-Sommerfeld problem. Figures 3c,d\npresent a comparison between the longwave mode c+ and the surface mode in the full formulation. The\nsurface mode was identified by tracing it from the longwave limit to \u03b1 = 1 using also the data presented in\nFloryan et al.15 for additional verification. Note that the comparison between the real part c+ mode and\nsurface mode is not as favourable as other comparisons presented on Figure 3. A possible reason for this\ndiscrepancy is that ideally, in order to keep the coefficient in the Stefan condition, it is necessary to consider\nthe complete O (\u03b1Re) decomposition. However these results allow us to identify the longwave asymptotic\nmodes c\u2212 and c+ as the ice mode and the surface mode in the numerical solution of Orr-Sommerfeld problem\n10\nrespectively.\nFrom the long wave asymptotic solution it is also clear that the ice layer affects the behavior of waves\non the water surface. Indeed, without the ice layer the surface mode is unstable in the longwave limit at\nsuch Reynolds numbers (the critical Reynolds number for \u03c6 = 0.01 being 125)12. While with the ice layer\npresent, the surface mode is stable in both long wave solution and numerical solution of Orr-Sommerfeld\nformulation. This effect will be considered in more detail in the next section.\n6 Linear stability results\n6.1 Ice mode instability\nThe results obtained from the longwave asymptotic solution provide us with the initial guess values required\nfor the ice and surface mode computations in the full Orr-Sommerfeld formulation. The starting values for\none more wave mode present in the flow, due to a Tollmien-Schlichting instability mechanism, were derived\nfrom De Bruin's data13.\nFigure 4 illustrates variations with the wave number of the imaginary and real parts of the complex phase\nspeed, cI(\u03b1) and cr(\u03b1) respectively, for all three modes at a fairly high but fixed Reynolds number and with\nthe other parameters chosen such that all three modes exhibit instability. One can see that when the ice\nmode is unstable the real part of the phase speed for this mode is negative. The absolute values of ci,r for\nthe ice mode are much smaller than those of shear and surface modes. This is consistent with the timescale\nanalysis and experimental results as characteristic time of the ice layer growth observed in experiments is\nmuch larger than the characteristic time of the flow development.\nIn order to verify further the physical identity of the third (ice) mode introduced by the ice layer, we\nperformed an additional test computation for the same control parameters but with the wall conditions on\nthe ice surface replaced with the fixed solid wall no-slip requirement. This leads to the interaction between\nthe temperature field and flow field (governed by the Stefan and kinematic conditions at the ice surface)\nbeing \u0010turned off\u0011 in effect. We found that at least graphically the plots for shear and surface modes in\nFigure 4 remained unaltered whereas the eigenvalues for the ice mode could not be obtained numerically.\nFigure 5a shows typical neutral curves for all three modes in the flow computed for H0 = 10, St = 0.0625\nand \u03c6 = 0.002 in the absence of surface tension. For this set of parameters, as well as for all other cases we\nhave computed the surface mode becomes unstable first. However the ice mode becomes unstable at lower\nReynolds numbers than the shear mode. The neutral curve for the ice mode consists of two characteristic\nbranches with the real part of the growth rate always negative inside the ice mode neutral curve. Following\n11\nthe results of the longwave asymptotic analysis, we note that in Figure 5a the Reynolds number axis does\nnot belong to the neutral curve of the surface mode so that the surface mode becomes stable in the longwave\nlimit.\nSince the media properties are fixed, investigation of the effect of surface tension reduces to two cases\nonly, namely \u03b6 = 0 or \u03b6 = 4899.38 (see, for example Floryan et al.15). In the system of governing equations\nthe influence of surface tension is confined to the term iv\u0302\u03b13Re\u2212 23\n(\n3\n2sin\u03c6\n)\u2212 13 \u03b6\/(u0l\u2212 c) in the normal stress\ntensor condition (Eq. (9)) on the free surface. The appearance of this term suggests that, for a fixed slope \u03c6,\nsurface tension is only significant at relatively small Reynolds numbers and sufficiently large wave numbers.\nAccordingly on the computed neutral curves the influence of surface tension is visible on the upper branch\nof the ice mode neutral curve only (Figure 5b).\nTable 1 presents critical parameters for the ice mode with and without surface tension. The critical point\nfor the lower branch of the ice mode neutral curve is found at Rec = 4094.2, \u03b1c = 0.00696, crc = \u22120.001034\nand it is not affected by surface tension within the precision of computations. This result can be expected\nsince the effect of surface tension on waves of that length should be negligible.\nLet us consider the effect of the Stefan number on the ice mode for constant water\/ice properties and\nconstant values of (H0, \u03c6, \u03b6) = (10, 0.002, 4899.38). Since St = CpLDT\/HLI , we find that for fixed media\nproperties St ' 0.01265DT and the Stefan number is determined by the characteristic temperature difference\nDT only. We will consider the small values of the characteristic temperature difference DT in the range\nof [1, 5], which corresponds to St \u2208 [0.01265, 0.0625]. Computations performed for this temperature range\nindicate that an increase of Stefan number tends to stabilize both branches of the ice mode neutral curve\n(Figure 6a). The values of critical parameters are summarized in Table 2 for the lower branch and Table 3\nfor the upper branch respectively.\nIn order to analyze the influence of the initial ice height H0, we need to estimate the range of H0. Initial\nice height is related to the wall temperature by H0 \u2212 1 = \u2212\u03bbILTW ' 4.0(T \u2217f \u2212 T \u2217W )\/DT . If we fix Stefan\nnumber at St = 0.0625 (which corresponds to DT ' 5), then H0 ' 1+0.8(T \u2217f \u2212T \u2217W ) and for reasonable wall\ntemperatures (> \u221230oC), the value of H0 is in the range H0 \u2208 (1.0, 25]. Figure 6b shows critical curves for\nthis range of initial ice height at fixed angle of incline \u03c6 = 0.002. As the initial ice height decreases, first the\nlower branch is stabilized followed by stabilization of disturbances near the upper branch. In the opposite\nlimit of increasing ice height the critical parameters on the upper branch tend to an asymptote and critical\nReynolds for the lower branch has a minimum (Figure 7). Note that for this angle of incline the critical\nReynolds number for the upper branch is always lower then that of the lower branch.\nVariation of the angle of incline has a significant influence on the neutral curve of the surface wave mode15\nand we expect similar behavior for the ice mode. We consider variation of the angle of incline for a fixed\n12\nStefan number (St = 0.0625), fixed initial ice height (H0 = 10) with the surface tension coefficient equal to\n4899.38. The choice of the initial ice height is motivated by the results obtained for the varying H0 which\nindicate that the ice mode is more unstable at large values of H0 and the critical Reynolds number tends to\na limit value as H0 increases.\nOur computations show that similarly to the behavior of the surface mode, the decrease of the angle\nof incline tends to stabilize both branches of the ice mode neutral curve (Figure 8a). Critical Reynolds\nnumber decreases rapidly as we increase the angle of incline (Figure 8b), however it always stays higher than\nthat of the surface mode. It is interesting that, at sufficiently small angles, the ice mode becomes unstable\nto disturbances of O(1) wave length earlier than to longwave disturbances, however as the angle of incline\nincreases this behavior changes and longwave instability becomes dominant. This means that although the\ncritical Reynolds number is a continuous function the angle of incline, both the critical wave number and\ncritical phase speed are discontinuous in the parametric space of the problem (Figures 8c and 8d).\n6.2 The influence of ice on shear and surface modes\nOur computations indicate that the ice layer has no significant influence on the shear mode. Even in the\nlongwave limit, the effect is limited to slight decrease in the real part of the phase speed (see Figure 9),\nhowever this decrease becomes discernible only at very small wave numbers where the shear mode is stable.\nInitial observations made in the longwave asymptotic solution suggest that the interaction between the\nice layer and the flow stabilizes long surface waves. This feature is observed in numerical solution of the\nOrr-Sommerfeld problem as well. Figure 10 shows cI(\u03b1) for the surface mode computed with and without\nice layer with fixed St = 0.0625, H0 = 10, and \u03c6 = 0.002 and various Reynolds numbers. From these results\nit can be seen that the stabilizing effect is greater at lower Reynolds numbers.\nIn the flow down an inclined plane without solidification, the neutral curve for the surface mode intersects\nwith the Reynolds number axis12. However when the ice layer is present, the neutral curve of the surface\nmode has no such intersection and develops a distinct critical point instead. Figure 11 shows neutral curves\nfor the surface mode with and without ice for the same wall slopes as used by Floryan et al.15.\nThe ice layer leads to an increase in the critical Reynolds number of the surface mode for larger angles\nof incline and a decrease in the critical Reynolds numbers for smaller angles. Figure 12a shows the critical\nReynolds number with and without ice layer as a function of the angle of incline in logarithmic scale. Here\nthe angle of incline is given in degrees to simplify comparison with Floryan et al.15. Note that while the\nReynolds number varies exponentially with the angle of incline without the ice sheet, with the ice sheet\npresent the line deviates from the exponential as we increase the angle. Figure 12b shows critical Reynolds\n13\nnumber difference defined as\nDRe =\nRenoice \u2212Reice\nRenoice\n100 (26)\nwhere Reice and Renoice are computed with and without the ice layer respectively. To quantify the trends\nindicated above, the borderline between small and large angles corresponds to \u03c6 = 1.44o (based on linear\nextrapolation). Figures 12c and 12d show variation of the critical wave number and phase speed respectively\nwith the angle of incline. Note that for the flow without ice, the critical wave number is zero and the critical\nphase speed is 2.0.\nTables 4, 5 and 6 show the influence of the Stefan number on the critical Reynolds number, wave number\nand phase speed respectively. The increase of the Stefan number destabilizes the flow for smaller angles of\nincline and stabilizes the flow for larger angles. The critical wave number increases steadily as the Stefan\nnumber increases. Also there is an increase in the critical wave speed, however the variation is extremely\nsmall.\n7 Discussion and conclusions\nIn this paper we consider linear stability of a water film flow down an inclined plane covered with a sheet\nof ice. We present an asymptotic solution of the stability equations in the long wave limit and show that in\nthis limit the presence of an ice layer generates an additional wave mode and modifies the behavior of the\nsurface mode making the latter stable to long wave disturbances. The asymptotic results are then used to\nidentify the ice mode in the numerical solution of the Orr-Sommerfeld problem with the conclusion that this\nnew mode of instability forms a neutral curve consisting of two distinct branches, one corresponding to long\nwaves and another for disturbances with O(1) wavelength. It is interesting to note that the real part of the\nphase speed for disturbances of the ice mode is negative.\nThe problem includes a number of free parameters and we present a detailed analysis of the ice mode\nbehavior under variation of these parameters including the influence of the surface tension, Stefan number,\ninitial ice height and angle of incline on the neutral curves and critical parameters of the ice mode. We find\nthat surface tension stabilizes the O(1) branch of the ice mode while having negligible effect on the longwave\nbranch. The increase of the Stefan number tends to stabilize both branches of the ice mode which can be\nexplained by the diminishing effect of the left hand side term in the Stefan condition (Eq. (17)). As the\nStefan number tends to infinity the left hand side of Eq. (17 tends to zero, which means that the flow and\ntemperature fields become decoupled and the ice layer no longer affects the flow stability.\n14\nAn increase of the unperturbed ice layer height leads to an increase of the critical Reynolds number on\nboth branches of the ice mode neutral curve. The stabilizing effect of increasing ice layer height is more\nvisible on the long wave branch which is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations made\nin pipe flows2,3 where the wavy ice-band structures are noted only when the ice layer becomes sufficiently\nthick. The ice mode behavior for varying angle of incline is similar to that of the surface mode with an\nincrease of the angle of incline leading to a decrease of the ice mode critical Reynolds number. The two-\nbranch structure of the ice mode neutral curve leads to an interesting behavior of the ice mode critical wave\nnumber and phase speed, which can become discontinuous functions of the angle of incline. For sufficiently\nlarge angles, the ice mode can become unstable at moderate Reynolds numbers, however our computations\nindicate that it becomes unstable at higher Reynolds numbers than the surface mode.\nWe also examine the effect of ice on the other instabilities present in the flow. Our computations indicate\nthat the effect of icing on the Tollmien-Schlichting mode is negligible, however the presence of an ice layer\nstabilizes the surface mode in the longwave limit and modifies the topology of the surface mode neutral\ncurve, creating a distinct turning point instead of the bifurcation point observed without an ice layer12.\nDetailed computations indicate that the effect of icing on the surface mode depends strongly on the angle of\nincline and is destabilizing for sufficiently small (\u03c6 < 1.44o) angles of incline and stabilizing for sufficiently\nlarge angles of incline (\u03c6 > 1.44o).\nReferences\n[1] J.T.
