Introduction. The Frequency Assignment problem (FAP) is a general\nframework focused on point-to-point communication, e.g., in radio or mobile telephone\nnetworks. One of its main threads asks for an assignment of frequencies or frequency\nchannels to transmitters while keeping interference at an acceptable level and making\nuse of the available frequencies in an efficient way. Interference constraints are usually\nrelated to the use of the same or similar frequencies at locations within a certain\ndistance (or transmitters within a certain reach) from each other. Due to the scarce\nresources and the increasing use of frequencies in modern wireless technology, the\navailable frequencies should be used as efficiently as possible. There is usually a\ntrade-off between avoiding interference and the efficient use of frequencies. We will\nnot go deeper into the technical details here.\n\u2217Received by the editors June 27, 2002; accepted for publication (in revised form) February 23,\n2004; published electronically October 1, 2004.

Each vertex of\nthe interference graph represents a transmitter. If simultaneous broadcasting of two\ntransmitters may cause an interference, then they are connected by an edge in the\ninterference graph. The frequency channels are usually labeled by positive integers.\nFrequency channels with \u201cclose\u201d labels are assumed to be \u201cclose\u201d in the spectrum or\nexpected to be \u201cmore likely\u201d to cause interference.\nRegarding the assumption that a pair of \u201cclose\u201d transmitters should be assigned\ndifferent frequencies or frequency channels, the FAP is equivalent to the problem of\nlabeling the interference graph with some constraints on the labeling. In many cases\nthe related labeling problems are variants on what is known as the vertex coloring\nproblem in graph theory.\nHowever, Hale [14] observed that the signal propagation may affect the interfer-\nence even in distant regions (but with decreasing intensity). Hence, not only \u201cclose\u201d\ntransmitters should get different frequencies, but also frequencies used at some dis-\ntance should be appropriately separated. This leads to a more detailed and compli-\ncated modeling of FAP in terms of distance constrained labeling of the interference\ngraph. (See, for instance, the book [16] by Leese.)\nIn some applications the transmitters are not allowed to operate on the same\nfrequency channel (for example, when every transmitter covers the whole area) while\n\u201cclose\u201d transmitters should use channels with sufficient separation. In this case non-\nreusable frequency channels should be assigned to transmitters in a proper way. This\nleads to the so-called Radio Labeling problem (RL), i.e., to the problem of assign-\ning distinct labels to the vertices of a graph such that adjacent vertices get labels\n(positive integers) that differ by at least two. The purpose of RL is to find such a\nradio labeling with the smallest maximum label.\nIn this paper we initiate the investigation of two versions of this problem in\nwhich some of the transmitters (like military and governmental stations) already\nhave preassigned labels corresponding to frequency channels which one is not allowed\nto change. Then the problem boils down to determining a radio labeling extending\na given prelabeling in a \u201cbest possible\u201d way. In this paper we consider some algo-\nrithmical, complexity-theoretical, and combinatorial aspects of these versions of the\nproblem.\nWe do not want to claim that the results in what follows have immediate practical\nrelevance.\n1.1. Definitions and preliminary observations. We denote by G = (V,E)\na finite undirected and simple graph. The girth of G is the length of a shortest cycle\nin G. For every nonempty W \u2286 V , the subgraph of G induced by W is denoted\nby G[W ]. A cograph is a graph containing no induced path on four vertices. The\n(open) neighborhood of a vertex v in a graph G is NG(v) := {u \u2208 V : {u, v} \u2208 E}.\nThe degree of a vertex v in G is dG(v) := |NG(v)|. The maximum degree of G is\n\u2206(G) := maxv\u2208V dG(v). A graph G is t-degenerate if each of its nonempty subgraphs\nhas a vertex of degree at most t. A clique C of a graph G is a subset of V such that\nall the vertices of C are pairwise adjacent in G. A nonempty subset of vertices I \u2286 V\nis independent in G if no two of its elements are adjacent in G. The complement G of\nG is the graph on V with edge set E such that {u, v} \u2208 E if and only if {u, v} \u0003\u2208 E.\nA k-coloring of the vertices of a graph G = (V,E) is a partition I1, I2, . . . , Ik of\nV into independent sets (in which some of the Ij may be empty); the k sets Ij are\ncalled the color classes of the k-coloring. The chromatic number \u03c7(G) is the minimum\nRADIO LABELING WITH PREASSIGNED FREQUENCIES 3\nvalue k for which a k-coloring exists. A labeling of (the vertex set of) G is an injective\nmapping L : V \u2192 N+ (the set of positive integers). A labeling L of G is called a radio\nlabeling of G if for any edge {u, v} \u2208 E the inequality |L(u) \u2212 L(v)| \u2265 2 holds; the\nspan of such a labeling L is maxv\u2208V L(v).\nThe Radio Labeling problem (RL) is defined as follows: For a given graph\nG, find a radio labeling L with the smallest span. The name radio labeling was sug-\ngested by Fotakis and Spirakis in [8], but the same notion (under different names) has\nbeen introduced independently and earlier by other researchers (see, e.g., Chang and\nKuo [2]). Problem RL is equivalent to the special case of the Traveling Salesman\nproblem TSP(2,1) in which all edge weights (distances) are either one or two. The\nrelation is as follows. For a graph G = (V,E) let KG be the complete weighted graph\non V with edge weights 1 and 2 defined according to E: For every {u, v} \u2208 E the\nweight w({u, v}) in KG is 2 and for {u, v} \u0003\u2208 E the weight w({u, v}) = 1. The weight\nof a path in KG is the sum of the weights of its edges. The following proposition can\nbe found in [8, 9].\nProposition 1.1. There is a radio labeling of G with span k if and only if there\nis a Hamiltonian path (i.e., a path on |V | vertices) of weight k \u2212 1 in KG.\nAnother equivalent formulation of this problem, which was extensively studied\nin the literature, is the Hamiltonian Path Completion problem (HPC), i.e., the\nproblem of partitioning the vertex set of a graph G into the smallest possible number\nof sets which are spanned by paths in G. This equivalence is expressed in the following\nwell-known proposition.\nProposition 1.2. There is a radio labeling of G with span \u2264 n + k \u2212 1 if and\nonly if there is a partition of V into \u2264 k sets, such that each of these sets induces a\nsubgraph in G that contains a Hamiltonian path.\nNow let us turn to the versions of RL with preassigned labels. For a graph G a\nradio prelabeling (or simply prelabeling) L\u2032 of a subset V \u2032 \u2282 V is an injective mapping\nL\u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192 N+ such that L\u2032 is a radio labeling of G[V \u2032]. We say that a labeling L of G\nextends the prelabeling L\u2032 if L(u) = L\u2032(u) for every u \u2208 V \u2032. We study the following\ntwo problems.\n\u2022 p-RL(\u2217): Radio Labeling with an arbitrary number of prelabeled\nvertices.\nFor a given graph G and a given prelabeling L\u2032 of G, determine a radio\nlabeling of G extending L\u2032 with the smallest span.\n\u2022 p-RL(l): Radio Labeling with a fixed number of prelabeled ver-\ntices.\nFor a given graph G, a subset V \u2032 \u2286 V with |V \u2032| \u2264 l, and a prelabeling\nL\u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192 N+, determine a radio labeling of G extending L\u2032 with the smallest\nspan.\n1.2. Earlier results. As we mentioned above, TSP(2,1) (which is equivalent\nto RL without any prelabeling) is a well-studied problem. Papadimitriou and Yan-\nnakakis [17] proved that this problem is MAX SNP-hard. Later Engebretsen [4] im-\nproved their result by showing that the problem is not approximable within 5381\/\n5380 \u2212 \u03b5 for any \u03b5 > 0. An approximation algorithm for TSP(2,1) which finds a\nsolution not worse than 7\/6 times the optimum solution is given in [17].\nDamaschke et al. [3] proved that the HPC can be solved in polynomial time\non cocomparability graphs (complements of comparability graphs). To obtain this\nresult they used a reduction to the problem of finding the bump number of a partial\norder. (The bump number of a poset P and its linear extension L is the number\n4 BODLAENDER, BROERSMA, FOMIN, PYATKIN, AND WOEGINGER\nof neighbors in L which are comparable in P .) It was proved by Habib, Mo\u00a8hring,\nand Steiner [13] and by Scha\u00a8ffer and Simons [19] that the Bump Number problem\ncan be solved in polynomial time. By Proposition 1.2, the result of Damaschke et\nal. [3] yields that RL is polynomial time solvable for comparability graphs. Later, this\nresult was rediscovered by Chang and Kuo [2] but under the name of L\u2032(2, 1)-labeling\nand only for cographs, a subclass of the class of comparability graphs. Notice that\nRL is NP-hard for cocomparability graphs because the Hamiltonian Path problem\nis known to be NP-hard for bipartite graphs which form a subclass of comparability\ngraphs. Recently, Fotakis and Spirakis [8] proved that RL can be solved in polynomial\ntime within the class of graphs for which a k-coloring can be obtained in polynomial\ntime (for some fixed k). Note that, for example, this class of graphs includes the\nwell-studied classes of planar graphs and graphs with bounded treewidth.\nWe are not aware of any existing results concerning the prelabeling versions\np-RL(\u2217) and p-RL(l) of RL.\nWe complete this subsection by mentioning some results concerning the related\nnotion of radio coloring (also known as L(2, 1)-labeling, \u03bb2,1-coloring, and \u03c72,1-\nlabeling). A radio coloring of a graph G = (V,E) is a function f : V \u2192 N+ such\nthat |f(u) \u2212 f(v)| \u2265 2 if {u, v} \u2208 E and |f(u) \u2212 f(v)| \u2265 1 if the distance between\nu and v in G is 2. Here the distance between two vertices u and v in a connected\ngraph G is the smallest number of edges in a path of G between u and v. Therefore,\nthe difference between radio coloring and radio labeling is that, in a radio coloring,\nvertices at distance at least three may have equal labels (or colors). The notion of\nradio coloring was introduced by Griggs and Yeh [12] under the name L(2, 1)-labeling.\nAs with radio labeling the span of a radio coloring f of G is maxv\u2208V f(v).\nThe problem of determining a radio coloring with minimum span has received a\nlot of attention. For various graph classes the problem was studied by Sakai [18], Bod-\nlaender et al. [1], van den Heuvel, Leese, and Shepherd [15], and others. NP-hardness\nresults for this Radio Coloring problem (RC) restricted to planar, split, or cobipar-\ntite graphs were obtained by Bodlaender et al. [1]. Fixed-parameter tractability prop-\nerties of RC have been discussed by Fiala, Kratochv\u00b4\u0131l, and Kloks [6]. Fiala, Fishkin,\nand Fomin [5] have studied on-line algorithms for RC. For only very few graph classes\nthe problem is known to be polynomially solvable. Chang and Kuo [2] obtained a poly-\nnomial time algorithm for RC restricted to trees and cographs. The complexity of\nRC even for graphs of treewidth 2 is a long-standing open question. An interesting\ndirection of research was initiated by Fiala, Kratochv\u00b4\u0131l, and Proskurowski [7]. They\nconsidered a precolored version of RC, i.e., a version in which some colors are preas-\nsigned to some vertices. They proved that RC with a given precoloring can be solved\nin polynomial time for trees. Recently Golovach [11] proved that RC with a given\nprecoloring is NP-hard for graphs of treewidth 2.\n1.3. Our results and organization of the paper. We study algorithmical,\ncomplexity-theoretical, and combinatorial aspects of radio labeling with prelabeled\nvertices. In section 2 we give some simple combinatorial bounds for the minimum\nspan of such labelings: We introduce an easy-to-compute lower bound M on the\nminimum span of a labeling extending a prelabeling, and we show that there always\nexists such a radio labeling\n\u2022 with span \u2264 \t(7M \u2212 2)\/3\n, for arbitrary graphs;\n\u2022 with span \u2264 \t(5M + 2)\/3\n, for graphs of girth at least 4;\n\u2022 with span \u2264M + 3, for graphs of girth at least 5.\nRADIO LABELING WITH PREASSIGNED FREQUENCIES 5\nAll these bounds are best possible. The third bound is even best possible for paths,\ni.e., for graphs of infinite girth. In section 3 we derive similar results for t-degenerate\ngraphs. In section 4 we obtain polynomial time algorithms for graphs with bounded\ndegree; these algorithms are based on the results of section 2.\nSections 5 and 6 are devoted to the algorithmical study of the radio labeling\nproblem with preassigned labels. We study these problems restricted to graphs for\nwhich a k-coloring is given and restricted to cographs, two graph classes for which\nthe radio labeling problem without prelabeling is known to be solvable in polynomial\ntime. Known and new results on these radio labeling problems are summarized in the\nfollowing table.\nGraphs with Graphs with a Cographs\na bounded \u2206 given k-coloring\nRL P [8] P [8] P [3, 2]\np-RL(l) P [\u2217] P [\u2217] ???\np-RL(\u2217) P [\u2217] NP for k \u2265 3 [\u2217] NP [\u2217]\nIn this table, an entry P denotes solvable in polynomial time, NP denotes NP-hard,\n[\u2217] denotes a contribution from this paper, and ??? marks an open problem.\nFor the results in the middle column, we assume that k is a fixed integer that is\nnot part of the input. Note that the class of graphs with a given k-coloring contains\nimportant and well-studied graph classes such as the class of planar graphs and the\nclass of graphs with bounded treewidth.\n2. Upper bounds for the minimum span. Let G = (V,E) denote a graph on\nn vertices, and let V \u2032 \u2286 V and L\u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192 N+ be a fixed subset of V and a prelabeling\nfor V \u2032, respectively. We define the parameter M , which will be very useful in the rest\nof the paper:\nM := max\n{\nn, max\nv\u2208V \u2032\nL\u2032(v)\n}\n.\nClearly, M is straightforward to compute if G and L\u2032 are known, and clearly, M is a\nlower bound on the span of any radio labeling in G extending the prelabeling L\u2032 of\nG. A natural question is how far M can be away from the minimum span of such a\nlabeling. We will show that the answer to this question heavily relies on the girth of\nthe graph G.\nTheorem 2.1. Let L\u2032 be a prelabeling of a graph G. Then there is a radio labeling\nin G extending L\u2032\n(a) with span \u2264 \t(7M \u2212 2)\/3\n;\n(b) with span \u2264 \t(5M + 2)\/3\n if G has girth at least 4;\n(c) with span \u2264M + 3 if G has girth at least 5.\nAll these bounds are best possible. The third bound is even best possible for the class\nof paths.\nProof. Let us start the proof of Theorem 2.1 by showing that all the stated bounds\nindeed are best possible: For (a), let x be a positive integer and y an integer such that\nM = 3x+y and \u22121 \u2264 y \u2264 1. We consider the complete graph on M vertices in which\nx vertices are prelabeled with labels 2, 5, 8, . . . , 3x\u2212 1, whereas the remaining 2x+ y\nvertices are unlabeled. Since we cannot use the labels 1, 2, . . . , 3x at the unlabeled\nvertices, and the labels at these vertices have to differ by at least two, the span of any\nradio labeling extending the prelabeling is at least 3x+2(2x+ y)\u2212 1 = 7x+2y\u2212 1 =\n\t(7M \u2212 2)\/3\n.\n6 BODLAENDER, BROERSMA, FOMIN, PYATKIN, AND WOEGINGER\nFor (b), let x be a positive integer and y be an integer such that M = 3x+ y and\n0 \u2264 y \u2264 2. We consider the complete bipartite graph Kx+1,2x+y\u22121 on M vertices.\nThe x + 1 vertices in the first part of the bipartition are prelabeled with the labels\n2, 5, 8, . . . , 3x \u2212 1 and with 3x + y, whereas the 2x + y \u2212 1 vertices in the second\npart of the bipartition are unlabeled. Note that the prelabeling forbids the labels\n1, . . . , 3x + y + 1 for the unlabeled vertices. Thus the span of any radio labeling\nextending the prelabeling is at least 5x+ 2y = \t(5M + 2)\/3\n.\nFinally, for (c) let M \u2265 7, and let x and y be integers such that M = 2x+ y + 7\nand 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1. We consider the path v1 \u2212 v2 \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 vM . The prelabeling assigns\nL\u2032(vk) = 2k+7 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 x, and L\u2032(vx+7+k) = 2k+6 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 x+y. Furthermore,\nwe have L\u2032(vx+1) = 7, L\u2032(vx+3) = 3, L\u2032(vx+5) = 5, and L\u2032(vx+7) = 1. Then all but\nthe three vertices vx+2, vx+4, vx+6 are prelabeled. Since we cannot use the labels\n2, 4, and 6 at these three vertices, every radio labeling of this path extending the\nprelabeling L\u2032 has a span of at least M + 3.\nThe greedy preprocessing step. In several of our proofs, we use the same prepro-\ncessing step. We denote this step as greedy preprocessing.\nGreedy preprocessing is done as follows. We extend the prelabeling by assigning\nlabels from {1, . . . ,M} to unlabeled vertices, such that all labels are different and\nsuch that adjacent vertices have labels that differ by at least two. This preprocessing\nstep terminates when we get stuck: Then either all vertices have been labeled or, for\nevery unused label c \u2208 {1, . . . ,M} and for every unlabeled vertex v, v is adjacent to\na vertex labeled with c\u2212 1 or v is adjacent to a vertex labeled with c+ 1. Note that\nthis greedy preprocessing step does not change the value of M .\nBlocked labels. Let L\u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192 N+ be a prelabeling of a graph G. We call a label\nc blocked if either it is used in the prelabeling or every vertex of V \\ V \u2032 is adjacent to\na vertex labeled by c\u2212 1 or c+ 1. Thus label c cannot be used for extending of L\u2032.\nProof of Theorem 2.1(a). It is sufficient to consider the case where G is the\ncomplete graph on n vertices. Assume that there are l = |V \u2032| prelabeled vertices and\nthat we start with the available labels 1, 2, . . . , N = \t(7M \u2212 2)\/3\n. Hence there are\nat most min{3l,M + 1} blocked labels. Order the remaining available (nonblocked)\nlabels increasingly, and assign the labels at the odd positions in the ordering to the\nremaining n \u2212 l vertices. Note that we need at most min{3l,M + 1} + 2(n \u2212 l) \u2212 1\nlabels. If 3l \u2264M + 1, then this number is at most\n3l + 2(n\u2212 l)\u2212 1 = 2n+ l \u2212 1 \u2264 2M + M + 1\n3\n\u2212 1 = 7M \u2212 2\n3\n.\nIf 3l \u2265M + 1, then this number is at most\nM + 1 + 2(n\u2212 l)\u2212 1 = M + 2n\u2212 2l \u2264 M + 2M \u2212 2M + 1\n3\n=\n7M \u2212 2\n3\n.\nTherefore, in both cases we obtain a feasible radio labeling with span at most \t(7M \u2212\n2)\/3\n.\nProof of Theorem 2.1(b). We start with N = \t(5M + 2)\/3\n available labels\n1, 2, . . . , N , perform the greedy preprocessing described above, and from now on con-\nsider the labeling thus obtained. If all vertices are labeled, then we are done and there\nis nothing to show. Otherwise, consider some fixed label c \u2208 {1, . . . ,M} that is not\nused in this labeling. Then every unlabeled vertex v must be adjacent to a vertex\nlabeled with c+1 or to a vertex labeled with c\u22121. Denote the set of unlabeled vertices\nRADIO LABELING WITH PREASSIGNED FREQUENCIES 7\nadjacent to c\u2212 1 by A, and denote the set of unlabeled vertices that are adjacent to\nc + 1 but not to c \u2212 1 by B. Then A must be an independent set. (Any edge in A\ntogether with the vertex labeled with c\u22121 would induce a triangle and bring the girth\nof G down to 3.) Also B must be an independent set.\nAssume that l vertices are labeled. Since every label blocks at most two other\nlabels, there are at most min{3l,M + 1} blocked labels and we have at least\n\t(5M + 2)\/3\n \u2212min{3l,M + 1} \u2265 n\u2212 l\navailable labels for the remaining n\u2212 l vertices. The displayed inequality can be seen\nas follows. If 3l \u2264M +1, then \t(2M +2)\/3\n \u2265 2l. Adding M \u2212 3l \u2265 n\u2212 3l yields the\ndesired inequality in this case. If 3l \u2265M+2, then n\u2212 l \u2264M\u2212\u000b(M+2)\/3\f. Together\nwith M \u2212 \u000b(M + 2)\/3\f \u2264 \t(5M + 2)\/3\n \u2212M \u2212 1, we get the desired inequality also\nfor this second case.\nNow we distinguish three subcases. In the first subcase, there are vertices a \u2208 A,\nb \u2208 B, such that a is not adjacent to b. We assign the |A| smallest of the n \u2212 l\navailable labels to the vertices in A and the |B| largest of these labels to the vertices\nin B. This is done in such a way that vertex a receives the largest label in A, and\nsuch that vertex b receives the smallest label in B. This gives a radio labeling with\nspan \u2264 \t(5M + 2)\/3\n.\nIn the second subcase, either A or B is empty. In this case, we use the n \u2212 l\navailable labels on the n\u2212 l vertices in A or B.\nIn the third subcase, we assume that none of A and B is empty and that they\nspan a complete bipartite graph, i.e., each vertex in A is adjacent to each vertex in\nB. Consider an arbitrary label d \u2208 {1, . . . ,M} that is not used in the prelabeling.\nThen every unlabeled vertex v \u2208 A \u222a B must be adjacent to the vertex labeled with\nd + 1 or to the vertex labeled with d \u2212 1. There are only two possibilities for this:\nEither all vertices in A are adjacent to the vertex labeled with d+ 1 and all vertices\nin B are adjacent to the vertex labeled with d\u2212 1, or all vertices in A are adjacent to\nthe vertex labeled with d\u2212 1 and all vertices in B are adjacent to the vertex labeled\nwith d+1. As a consequence, there are at most min{2l,M +1} blocked labels in this\nsubcase, and at least\n\t(5M + 2)\/3\n \u2212min{2l,M + 1} \u2265 n\u2212 l + 1\navailable labels for the remaining n \u2212 l vertices. We assign the |A| smallest of these\nlabels arbitrarily to the vertices in A and the |B| largest of these labels arbitrarily to\nthe vertices in B.\nProof of Theorem 2.1(c). We start with the greedy preprocessing described above,\nand from now on consider the labeling thus obtained. Denote by C = {c1, . . . , ck}\nwith c1 < c2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ck the set of all unused labels from {1, . . . ,M} in the labeling\nobtained after the preprocessing. Denote by U the set of unlabeled vertices. It is\nclear that |U | \u2264 |C|. We prove that the labeling obtained by the greedy preprocessing\ncan always be extended to a radio labeling of G using at most three additional labels\nM + 1, M + 2, and M + 3.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that after the greedy preprocessing there is\na vertex of G labeled with M . (If this is not the case, the same proof produces a span\n\u2264 M + 2.) For the sake of convenience we shall identify each labeled vertex with its\nlabel. If |U | = 1, we just label the only unlabeled vertex with label M +2. If |U | = 2,\nthen either the two unlabeled vertices are nonadjacent and we can label them with\n8 BODLAENDER, BROERSMA, FOMIN, PYATKIN, AND WOEGINGER\nFig. 1. A step in the proof of Theorem 2.1(c).\nM + 2 and M + 3, or at least one of them is not adjacent to M (since G contains no\n3-cycles), and we label this vertex with M + 1 and the other vertex with M + 3.\nFrom now on we assume |U | \u2265 3. If C contains two consecutive labels d and\nd + 1, then every vertex in U must be adjacent to the vertices labeled with d \u2212 1\nand d + 2. This yields a cycle of length four in G and contradicts the assumption\non the girth of G. Therefore, there are no consecutive labels in C, and in particular\nc3 \u2212 1 > c1 + 1.\nNext, we first discuss the case |U | \u2265 4. Then |C| \u2265 4 and c3 < M . Suppose for\nthe sake of contradiction that c1 = 1. Then all vertices in U are adjacent to label 2,\nand at least two vertices of U are adjacent to c3 \u2212 1 or to c3 + 1. This would yield\na cycle of length four. This contradiction shows c1 \u2265 2. There cannot be more than\ntwo vertices of U adjacent to c1 \u2212 1 because otherwise at least two of them would be\nadjacent to c3 +1 or to c3\u2212 1, and we again would obtain a 4-cycle. Similarly, we see\nthat at most two vertices of U are adjacent to c1 + 1. As a consequence, each of the\nvertices c1 \u2212 1 and c1 + 1 has exactly two neighbors in U . This implies that |U | = 4\nand that each vertex of U is adjacent to exactly one of c1 \u2212 1 and c1 + 1. Denote the\nfour vertices in U by u1, u2, u3, u4 such that u1 and u2 are the neighbors of c1 \u2212 1,\nand u3 and u4 are the neighbors of c1 + 1. Moreover, we may assume that u1 and u3\nare adjacent to c3 \u2212 1 and that u2 and u4 are adjacent to c3 + 1; see Figure 1.\nFor every label c \u2208 C \\ {c1, c3} we have that |{c\u2212 1, c+1}\u2229{c1\u2212 1, c1 +1, c3\u2212 1,\nc3 + 1}| = 0. Otherwise, we either obtain a 4-cycle or can use the label c at one of\nthe vertices in U ; as an example, consider the case that c\u2212 1 = c1 + 1: Then we can\nuse the label c at u1 or u2 unless both are adjacent to c1 + 3, yielding a 4-cycle with\nc1 \u2212 1; the other cases are similar. However, then there are only two possibilities for\nthe vertices in U to be the neighbor of c \u2212 1 or c + 1 without creating a 4-cycle: u1\nand u4 should be adjacent to one of these labels and u2 and u3 to the other. Since\n|C \\ {c1, c3}| \u2265 2 and C does not contain consecutive integers, we obtain a 4-cycle in\nG, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the case |U | \u2265 4 cannot occur at all.\nWe are left with the case that |U | = 3. By similar arguments as above, we may\nassume that c1\u22121 is adjacent to u1, that c1+1 is adjacent to u2 and u3, that c3+1 is\nadjacent to u1 and u2, and that c3\u22121 is adjacent to u3 (the other cases are analogous).\nThe girth condition implies that the graph induced by the vertices {u1, u2, u3} has\nat most one edge, the edge {u1, u3}. If such an edge exists, then M is nonadjacent\nto one of these two vertices, and we label this vertex with M + 1 and the other one\nwith M + 3; in that case the vertex u2 is labeled with M + 2. If there is no such\nedge, then M is nonadjacent to at least one of the vertices ui (otherwise we obtain a\nRADIO LABELING WITH PREASSIGNED FREQUENCIES 9\n4-cycle) and we label this vertex with M + 1 and the other two vertices with M + 2\nand M + 3. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1(c).\nNote that the proof of Theorem 2.1(c) yields a linear time approximation algo-\nrithm determining a radio labeling extending a prelabeling in graphs with girth \u2265 5\nwith a span that is at most an additive 3 away from the minimum span.\n3. Graphs with bounded degeneracy. In this section, we apply the tech-\nniques from the proof of Theorem 2.1 to t-degenerate graphs, i.e., graphs with the\nproperty that each of their nonempty subgraphs has a vertex of degree at most t.\nWe will also use the easy fact that a t-degenerate graph on n vertices has at most\nt(n \u2212 t) + t(t \u2212 1)\/2 edges. First we consider the case without any prelabeling and\nobtain the following result, which is easy to prove. This result will be used in the case\nwhere a prelabeling is assumed.\nLemma 3.1. If G is a t-degenerate graph on n vertices, then it has a radio labeling\nwith span \u2264 n+ 2t.\nProof. Let G be a counterexample to Lemma 3.1 with the least number of vertices.\nRemove a vertex v of minimum degree from G and consider a radio labeling with span\n\u2264 n\u2212 1+ 2t in G\u2212 v (which exists by the choice of G). If we started with the n+2t\navailable labels 1, 2, . . . , n+2t, there are 2t+1 unused labels left. Since v has degree\nat most t and each neighbor of v forbids the use of at most two labels at v, we can\nchoose a suitable label for v.\nWe now turn to the variant in which a prelabeling is assumed. We obtain an\nupper bound for the minimum span of a radio labeling extending the prelabeling in a\nt-degenerate graph, depending on M and t only.\nTheorem 3.2. If G is a t-degenerate graph and L\u2032 is a prelabeling of G, then\nthere exists a radio labeling extending L\u2032 with span \u2264M + (4 +\u221a3)t+ 1.\nProof. We again start with the greedy preprocessing step as described in the\npreceding section, and with available labels 1, 2, . . . ,M . Denote by U the set of\nunlabeled vertices after this step. We only consider the case where |U | = 2p for some\npositive integer p; the case with odd |U | is similar and left to the reader. Denote by\nC = {c1, . . . , c2p} with c1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < c2p the set of the first 2p unused labels. It is clear\nthat C cannot contain three consecutive labels c\u22121, c, c+1 (otherwise, we can use the\nlabel c at some vertex of U). Thus for every i we have ci+1 < ci+2\u2212 1. Consider the\nset C \u2032 of vertices labeled by ci \u2212 1 and ci + 1 for every odd i = 1, 3, . . . , 2p\u2212 1. Then\nC \u2032 contains at most 2p vertices and each unlabeled vertex of U must be adjacent to\na vertex labeled by ci \u2212 1 or ci + 1 for every odd i = 1, 3, . . . , 2p \u2212 1. The graph\ninduced by the set U \u222a C \u2032 has at most 4p vertices. Denote the number of edges of\nthis graph by x. We have 2p2 \u2264 x \u2264 (4p\u2212 t)t+ (t\u2212 1)t\/2 = 4pt\u2212 t2\/2\u2212 t\/2. Thus\n(p \u2212 t)2 \u2264 3t2\/4 \u2212 t\/4 \u2264 3t2\/4, yielding 2p \u2264 (2 +\u221a3)t. Using Lemma 3.1 and the\nfact that G[U ] is t-degenerate, we can label the unlabeled vertices of U with the labels\n{M + 2, . . . ,M + \t(4 +\u221a3)t\n+ 1}. This completes the proof.\nThe above results imply a polynomial time approximation algorithm for solving\nthe radio labeling problem (with prelabeling) in t-degenerate graphs. It is possible\nthat the bound in Theorem 3.2 can be improved considerably. We pose the following\nconjecture.\nConjecture. If G is a t-degenerate graph and L\u2032 is a prelabeling of G, then\nthere exists a radio labeling extending L\u2032 with span \u2264M + 3t.\nThe upper bound in the above conjecture cannot be improved. For t = 1 this is\nclear from earlier examples. (See the discussion on case (c) of Theorem 2.1.) Let us\nshow it here for general t by the following example. Let V be the union of disjoint sets\n10 BODLAENDER, BROERSMA, FOMIN, PYATKIN, AND WOEGINGER\nA, B, C, and D, with |A| = |B| = |C| = t, |D| = t+1. Let A be a clique, and assume\nthat each vertex of B \u222a C is adjacent to every vertex from A. Finally assume B \u222aD\ninduces a complete bipartite graph with bipartition (B,D). Let G be the graph on V\nwith the described edges. One easily checks that G is a t-degenerate graph. Prelabel\nthe vertices of C with labels 3, 7, . . . , 4t\u22121 and of D with labels 1, 5, . . . , 4t+1. Then\nM = 4t+ 1 and none of the even labels less than M can be used for labeling A \u222aB.\nSince each vertex of A is adjacent to all other vertices of A\u222aB, we lose t labels more,\nand the largest label we have to use is at least 7t+ 1 = M + 3t.\n4. Graphs with a bounded maximum degree. We now turn to graphs with\na bounded maximum degree. Using similar proof techniques as in the previous section,\nwe will prove that p-RL(\u2217) is polynomially solvable within this class of graphs. We\nfirst prove the next technical result on t-degenerate graphs.\nTheorem 4.1. Let G = (V,E) be a t-degenerate graph with maximum degree \u2206\nand let V \u2032 \u2286 V be the set of vertices that is prelabeled by L\u2032. If the number p = |V \\V \u2032|\nof unlabeled vertices satisfies p \u2265 4\u2206(t+1), then L\u2032 can be extended to a radio labeling\nof G with span M .\nProof. Let H = G[V \\ V \u2032] be the graph induced by the unlabeled vertices, and\nstart with the available labels 1, 2, . . . ,M . As long as H has edges we will apply\nthe following labeling procedure. Consider a vertex v of minimal positive degree in\nH. It has at most t neighbors. We can label them all with unused labels because\nthere are at most 2\u2206 \u2212 2 blocked labels among the unused labels and the number\nof available labels in every step is at least the number of unlabeled vertices at that\nmoment, which is always at least 4\u2206. Adapt H by removing the neighbors of v. In\neach step we reduce the number of unlabeled vertices by at most t and increase the\nnumber of isolated vertices by one. Since p \u2265 4\u2206(t + 1), we have q \u2265 4\u2206 isolated\nvertices in H when H becomes edgeless.\nWe now show that the set Q of the remaining q isolated vertices of H can be\nlabeled with unused labels from the set {1, . . . ,M}. Denote the set of such labels by\nC (it is clear that |C| \u2265 q) and consider the auxiliary bipartite graph G\u2032 with vertex\npartition Q \u222a C where an edge {v, c} exists if and only if the vertex v of Q can be\nlabeled with the label c. It is sufficient to show that G\u2032 has a matching saturating all\nvertices of Q. Suppose that there is no such matching. Then by standard matching\ntheory there is a set A \u2282 Q such that |A| = a and |N(A)| \u2264 a\u2212 1 (where N(A) is the\nneighborhood of A in G\u2032). Let B = C \\N(A). We have |B| \u2265 q\u2212a+1. Note that each\nlabel could be forbidden for at most 2\u2206 vertices and, vice versa, that for every vertex\nat most 2\u2206 labels could be forbidden. Therefore, since there are no edges between A\nand B, we have a \u2264 2\u2206 and q\u2212 a+1 \u2264 |B| \u2264 2\u2206, but this implies q \u2264 4\u2206\u2212 1, which\nis a contradiction. This completes the proof.\nFrom Theorem 4.1 we easily obtain the following complexity result for graphs\nwith a bounded maximum degree.\nCorollary 4.2. Let k be a fixed positive integer. For every graph G with maxi-\nmum degree \u2206 \u2264 k and prelabeling L\u2032, p-RL(\u2217) can be solved in polynomial time.\nProof. Each graph with maximum degree \u2206 is clearly \u2206-degenerate. If at most\n4\u2206(\u2206 + 1) vertices of G are not prelabeled by L\u2032, then one can use a brute force\nalgorithm to find a radio labeling extending L\u2032 with a minimum span, e.g., by checking\nall admissible labelings. The time complexity of such a brute force algorithm is\nO(n4\u2206(\u2206+1)). If more than 4\u2206(\u2206 + 1) vertices are unlabeled, then by Theorem 4.1\nthere is a radio labeling extending L\u2032 with span M (which is clearly the minimum),\nand from the proof of Theorem 4.1 it is not difficult to check that such a labeling can\nRADIO LABELING WITH PREASSIGNED FREQUENCIES 11\nbe found in polynomial time.\nThe above corollary shows that p-RL(l) and p-RL(\u2217) have the same complexity\nbehavior as RL for graphs with a bounded maximum degree, i.e., all three of the\nproblems can be solved in polynomial time. This picture changes if we restrict our-\nselves to graphs which are k-colorable and for which a k-coloring is given (as part of\nthe input) for some fixed positive integer k. This is the topic of the next section.\n5. Graphs with a bounded chromatic number. In this section we concen-\ntrate on radio labeling algorithms for graphs with a bounded chromatic number, in\nparticular for the case where a k-coloring of the graph (for a fixed constant k) is\nprovided as part of the input.\nRelated to Proposition 1.1 we discussed the useful equivalence between RL and\nTSP(2,1). We now adapt this equivalence to capture the restrictions of the prela-\nbeling problem. Let L be a labeling of a graph G = (V,E) on n vertices. The path\nP = (v1, v2, . . . , vn) corresponding to L visits the vertices by increasing labels, i.e., for\nall 1 \u2264 a < b \u2264 n we have L(va) < L(vb). P is a path in the complete graph KG; its\nweight w(P ) is measured according to the edge weights w in KG as introduced in the\nparagraph preceding Proposition 1.1.\nLemma 5.1. Let L\u2032 be a prelabeling of a subset V \u2032 \u2286 V of a graph G = (V,E),\nand let P = (v1, v2, . . . , vn) be an ordering of the vertices of G. Then the path P\nin KG corresponds to some extension L of L\n\u2032 to V if and only if the following two\nconditions are satisfied:\n(T1) For any 1 \u2264 a < b \u2264 n with va, vb \u2208 V \u2032, the weight w(va, va+1, . . . , vb) of the\nsubpath from va to vb is at most L\n\u2032(vb)\u2212 L\u2032(va).\n(T2) Let c be the smallest index with vc \u2208 V \u2032. If c \u0003= 1, then the weight w(v1, v2, . . . ,\nvc) of the subpath from v1 to vc is at most L\n\u2032(vc)\u2212 1.\nFor any path P that satisfies (T1) and (T2), a labeling L extending L\u2032 with the\nsmallest possible span can be computed in polynomial time O(n).\nProof. Suppose P corresponds to a labeling L that extends L\u2032. Let a < b, va,\nvb \u2208 V \u2032. Consider the path va, va+1, . . . , vb. By induction, we see that for all i with\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 b\u2212a, L(va+i) is at least the sum of L(va) and the weight w(va, va+1, . . . , va+i)\nof the subpath from va to va+i. Therefore, L(vb) \u2265 L(va) + w(va, va+1, . . . , vb), and\n(T1) follows. In a similar way, it can be shown that (T2) must hold.\nThe \u201cif\u201d-statement remains to be proved. Consider a path P that satisfies (T1)\nand (T2). We construct the following labeling L: If v1 \u2208 V \u2032, then we set L(v1) =\nL\u2032(v1), and if v1 \/\u2208 V \u2032, then we set L(v1) = 1. For i \u2265 2 and vi \u2208 V \u2032, we set L(vi) =\nL\u2032(vi). Finally for i \u2265 2 and vi \/\u2208 V \u2032, we set L(vi) = L(vi\u22121)+ 1 if {vi, vi\u22121} \u0003\u2208 E and\nwe set L(vi) = L(vi\u22121) + 2 otherwise.\nIt can be seen that the above procedure in fact computes a labeling L with the\nsmallest possible span for P among all labelings that extend L\u2032.\nNow let G = (V,E) be a graph with a given k-coloring with color classes I1, I2, . . . ,\nIk. Let L\n\u2032 be a prelabeling of a subset V \u2032 \u2286 V with |V \u2032| = l. Let L be a radio labeling\nof G that extends L\u2032, and let P = (v1, v2, . . . , vn) be the path corresponding to L.\nConsider two consecutive vertices va and va+1 along this path with va \u2208 Ii and\nva+1 \u2208 Ij . If i = j, then va and va+1 form a monochromatic edge. If i \u0003= j, then va\nand va+1 form a bichromatic edge of type (i, j).\nLemma 5.2. Let G = (V,E) be a graph with a k-coloring with color classes\nI1, I2, . . . , Ik. Let L\n\u2032 be a prelabeling of a subset V \u2032 \u2286 V with |V \u2032| = l. Then there\nexists a radio labeling L of G extending L\u2032 with the smallest possible span, such that\nits corresponding path P satisfies the following two conditions:\n12 BODLAENDER, BROERSMA, FOMIN, PYATKIN, AND WOEGINGER\nFig. 2. A step in the proof of property (P1) in Lemma 5.2.\n(P1) For any bichromatic edges {va, va+1} and {vb, vb+1} of type (i, j) with a < b\nand i\u0003=j, there exists a prelabeled vertex vc \u2208 V \u2032 on the subpath (va+1, . . . , vb).\n(P2) P contains at most (l + 1)k(k \u2212 1) bichromatic edges.\nProof. Among all radio labelings of G that extend L\u2032 with the smallest possible\nspan, consider a labeling L for which the corresponding path P = (v1, v2, . . . , vn)\ncontains the maximal possible number of monochromatic edges.\nSuppose that this path P violates property (P1). Then there exist two bichromatic\nedges {va, va+1} and {vb, vb+1} of type (i, j) with a < b and i \u0003= j, such that none of\nthe vertices on the subpath (va+1, . . . , vb) are prelabeled; see Figure 2. We replace the\nsubpath (va, va+1, va+2, . . . , vb\u22121, vb, vb+1) of P by (va, vb, vb\u22121, vb\u22122, . . . , va+1, vb+1),\nand thus produce a new path P \u2217. Since the edges {va, vb} and {va+1, vb+1} are\nmonochromatic, whereas the edges {va, va+1} and {vb, vb+1} were not, the new path\nP \u2217 has more monochromatic edges than P . Moreover, if we compute a labeling L\u2217 for\nP \u2217 as indicated in the proof of Lemma 5.1, then the span of L\u2217 is at most the span\nof L. This contradicts our choice of the labeling L. Hence, P satisfies property (P1).\nProperty (P2) is a simple quantitative consequence of property (P1): The prela-\nbeled vertices split P into l + 1 subpaths, and any such subpath contains at most\none bichromatic edge of type (i, j). Since there are only k(k \u2212 1) possible types of\nbichromatic edges, the bound in property (P2) follows.\nTheorem 5.3. Let G = (V,E) be a graph with a given k-coloring with color\nclasses I1, I2, . . . , Ik. Let L\n\u2032 be a prelabeling of a subset V \u2032 \u2286 V with |V \u2032| = l. Then\na radio labeling L of G extending L\u2032 with the smallest possible span can be computed\nin time O(n4(l+1)k(k\u22121)).\nProof. The proof is based on Lemma 5.2. The idea is to use a brute force\nalgorithm that enumerates all possible subsets of bichromatic edges as described in\nproperty (P2) and then tries to extend them to a radio labeling. This is done in the\nfollowing way.\n1. Compute all possible subsets S of at most (l+ 1)k(k\u2212 1) bichromatic edges.\n2. For each such subset S, compute all possible functions f : S \u2192 {1, . . . , n\u22121}.\nThe interpretation of f(va, va+1) = m is that va is the mth vertex and that\nva+1 is the (m+ 1)th vertex on the path.\n3. Compute all possible functions g : V \u2032 \u2192 {1, . . . , n}. The interpretation of\ng(vc) = m is that vc is the mth vertex on the path.\n4. For each subset S and all functions f and g, determine whether there exists a\ncompatible path. If such a path exists, then compute a corresponding labeling\nwith the smallest possible span according to Lemma 5.1.\n5. Output the detected labeling with the minimum span.\nThere are O(n2(l+1)k(k\u22121)) possible subsets S in the first step, and there are\nO(n(l+1)k(k\u22121)) possible functions f in the second step. Furthermore, there are O(nl)\npossible functions g in the third step. Below, we will show that the fourth step\nRADIO LABELING WITH PREASSIGNED FREQUENCIES 13\ncan be performed in O(n2) time. This yields an overall time complexity of at most\nO(n4(l+1)k(k\u22121)).\nHow do we check compatibility in the fourth step? If any vertex is assigned to two\nor more distinct positions (for instance, since it is incident with two or more bichro-\nmatic edges in S), then there clearly exists no compatible path. Also, if there are two\nor more distinct vertices assigned to the same position (for instance, by f and by g),\nthen there clearly exists no compatible path. Therefore, from now on we will assume\nthat every vertex goes to at most one position, and any position receives at most one\nvertex. Then the functions f and g fully determine the positions of all prelabeled ver-\ntices and the positions of all vertices on bichromatic edges in the corresponding path.\nWhat about the empty positions? Consider a maximal piece Z of empty positions,\nand let z\u0001 and zr be the vertices assigned to the position immediately to the left of Z\nand immediately to the right of Z, respectively. Then z\u0001 and zr must belong to the\nsame color class Ij . Otherwise, there is a missing bichromatic edge, and there cannot\nbe a compatible path. Therefore, we will assume that z\u0001 and zr belong to the same\ncolor class Ij ; then the vertices that go into positions in Z must all be in Ij . This\ndetermines the color class for all empty positions.\nWe randomly assign the remaining vertices to the empty positions, subject to\nthe condition that every empty position receives a vertex of the right color class. If\nno such assignment exists, then there cannot be a compatible path. Otherwise, all\nthese random assignments yield a path with the same sequence of edge weights w in\nKG. We finally check whether conditions (T1) and (T2) of Lemma 5.1 are satisfied\nby the resulting path and use this lemma to compute a corresponding labeling with\nthe smallest possible span.\nFor each of the graph classes in the following corollary, it is possible to construct\na vertex coloring with a constant number of colors in polynomial time. Hence we have\nthe following.\nCorollary 5.4. The radio labeling problem p-RL(l) is polynomially solvable\n\u2022 on the class of planar graphs;\n\u2022 on any class of graphs of bounded treewidth;\n\u2022 on the class of bipartite graphs.\nThe above results show that p-RL(l) is solvable in polynomial time for graphs\nwith a bounded chromatic number and a given coloring. This result does not carry\nover to the more general labeling problem p-RL(\u2217) where the number of prelabeled\nvertices is part of the input. We next show that p-RL(\u2217) is NP-hard even when\nrestricted to 3-colorable graphs with a given 3-coloring; this result then easily gen-\neralizes to k-colorable graphs (k \u2265 4) with a given k-coloring. We use a polynomial\ntime transformation from the following problem.\nPartition into Triangles\nInstance: A graph G = (V,E) with |V | = 3q for a positive integer q.\nQuestion: Is there a partition of V into triangles, i.e., into V1, V2, . . . , Vq\nsuch that G[Vi] = K3?\nThis problem remains NP-hard even when the graph G = (V,E) is 3-colorable and a\npartition of V into independent sets I1, I2, I3 with |I1| = |I2| = |I3| is given. This can\nbe proved by replacing Exact Cover by 3-Sets in the reduction on pages 68\u201369\nof Garey and Johnson [10] by 3-Dimensional Matching.\nTheorem 5.5. For any fixed k \u2265 3, problem p-RL(\u2217) is NP-hard even when the\ninput is restricted to graphs with a given k-coloring.\nProof. Let us first prove the theorem for k = 3. Let G = (V,E) be a graph and\nlet I1, I2, I3, |I1| = |I2| = |I3| = q be a partition of V into three independent sets. We\n14 BODLAENDER, BROERSMA, FOMIN, PYATKIN, AND WOEGINGER\nconstruct a graph F = (VF , EF ) and a prelabeling L\n\u2032 of F such that there is a radio\nlabeling of F with span \u2264 K extending L\u2032 if and only if V can be partitioned into\ntriangles.\nThe graph F is obtained as follows: VF is the disjoint union of four independent\nsets V A1 , V\nB\n1 , V2, V3 of cardinality q. (The vertices of V\nA\n1 , V\nB\n1 correspond to I1, the\nvertices of V2 to I2, and those of V3 to I3. Also for simplicity we denote vertices from\nVF and the corresponding vertices from V by the same letters.)\nEF = {{u, v} : u \u2208 V A1 , v \u2208 V2 and {u, v} \u0003\u2208 E}\u222a,(1)\n{{u, v} : u \u2208 V B1 , v \u2208 V3 and {u, v} \u0003\u2208 E}\u222a,(2)\n{{u, v} : u \u2208 V2, v \u2208 V3 and {u, v} \u0003\u2208 E}\u222a,(3)\n{{u, v} : u \u2208 V A1 , v \u2208 V3}\u222a,(4)\n{{u, v} : u \u2208 V B1 , v \u2208 V2}.(5)\nThe vertices of V A1 are prelabeled with integers 4i \u2212 3 and the vertices of V B1 are\nprelabeled with 4i, where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 q.\nNotice that F is 3-colorable because the sets V A1 \u222a V B1 , V2, V3 are independent.\nWe claim that there is a radio labeling with span at most K = 4q in F extending the\nprelabeling if and only if the vertex set V of G can be partitioned into q triangles.\nIf there is such a radio labeling in F with span K, then every label from {1, 2, . . . ,\nK} should be used in this labeling. Then for every i with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 q, the vertices\nlabeled with 4i \u2212 3 and 4i are in V A1 and V B1 (because of the prelabeling). Then by\n(4), the vertices labeled with 4i\u2212 2 should be in V2, and by (5), the vertices labeled\nwith 4i\u22121 should be in V3. Then by (1), (2), and (3), the vertices in G corresponding\nto vertices labeled with 4i\u2212 3, 4i\u2212 2, 4i\u2212 1, 4i induce a triangle in G. Hence, V can\nbe partitioned into q triangles.\nFor the converse, consider a partition into triangles of V in G. For every triangle\nwith vertex set {v1, v2, v3}, vi \u2208 Ii, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, the corresponding four vertices\nvA1 \u2208 V A1 , vB1 \u2208 V B1 , v2 \u2208 V2, v3 \u2208 V3 in F can be labeled with four consecutive\nlabels. The vertices vA1 , v\nB\n1 are prelabeled with 4j \u2212 3 and 4j for some j; by (1),\nvertex v2 can be labeled with 4j \u2212 2, and by (2) and (3), vertex v3 can be labeled\nwith 4j\u2212 1. Therefore, F has a radio labeling extending the prelabeling with at most\n4q = K labels. This settles the case for 3-colorable graphs with a given 3-coloring.\nTo prove the theorem for any fixed k \u2265 3, we add to the graph F two disjoint\ncliques of size k and prelabel the vertices of one clique with labels {4q+1, 4q+3, . . . ,\n4q+ 2k\u2212 1} and of the other clique with {4q+ 2, 4q+ 4, . . . , 4q+ 2k}. Then the new\ngraph is k-colorable, and using the previous arguments it is clear that this graph has\na radio labeling with 4q+2k labels extending the prelabeling if and only if the graph\nG has a partition into triangles. This completes the proof.\n6. NP-completeness results for cographs. We now turn to the last class\nof graphs for which RL is known to be polynomially solvable, namely the class of\ncographs, i.e., graphs without an induced path on four vertices. Using an easy reduc-\ntion from 3-Partition we show that p-RL(\u2217) is NP-hard for cographs.\nTheorem 6.1. Problem p-RL(\u2217) is NP-hard for cographs.\nProof. We use a reduction from the problem 3-Partition stated below to\np-RL(\u2217).\n3-Partition\nInstance: A set A of nonnegative integers a1, . . . , a3m and a bound\nB, such that for all i with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3m, (B+1)\/4 < ai < B\/2 and\u2211\n1\u2264i\u22643m ai = mB.\nRADIO LABELING WITH PREASSIGNED FREQUENCIES 15\nQuestion: Can A be partitioned into m disjoint sets A1, A2, . . . , Am\nsuch that\n\u2211\nai\u2208Aj ai = B for every j with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m?\n3-Partition is NP-complete in the strong sense (Problem SP15 in Garey and John-\nson [10]).\nLet the set A = {a1, . . . , a3m} and the bound B be an instance of 3-Partition.\nConsider a complete (3m+ 1)-partite graph GA with vertex partition V = V0 \u222a V1 \u222a\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a V3m, where |V0| = m \u2212 1 and |Vi| = ai for every i with i = 1, . . . , 3m. This\nmeans there is an edge between a vertex v \u2208 Vi and a vertex w \u2208 Vj if and only if\ni \u0003= j. Clearly, GA is a cograph because it obviously does not contain a path on four\nvertices as an induced subgraph. Prelabel the vertices v1, . . . , vm\u22121 of V0 using the\nlabels L\u2032(vj) = j(B + 5)\u2212 1, where j = 1, . . . ,m\u2212 1 and let K = m(B + 5)\u2212 3. We\nshow that the prelabeling L\u2032 of GA can be extended to a radio labeling with span\n\u2264 K if and only if A can be 3-partitioned.\nIf there is a 3-partition A1, . . . , Am, then each of the sets Ai contains exactly\nthree elements ai1 , ai2 , and ai3 . Consider then for every i = 1, . . . ,m the following\nlabeling:\n\u2022 Vertices of the set Vi1 are labeled with\n{(i\u2212 1)(B + 5) + 1, . . . , (i\u2212 1)(B + 5) + ai1};\n\u2022 vertices of the set Vi2 are labeled with\n{(i\u2212 1)(B + 5) + ai1 + 2, . . . , (i\u2212 1)(B + 5) + ai1 + ai2 + 1};\n\u2022 vertices of the set Vi3 are labeled with\n{(i\u2212 1)(B + 5) + ai1 + ai2 + 3, . . . , (i\u2212 1)(B + 5) + ai1 + ai2 + ai3 + 2}.\nSince ai1 + ai2 + ai3 = B, this produces a radio labeling extending the prelabeling L\n\u2032\nwith span \u2264 K.\nFor the converse, suppose that a radio labeling of GA extending the prelabeling L\n\u2032\nwith span \u2264 K exists. For j = 1, . . . ,m, let Bj = {(j\u22121)(B+5)+1, . . . , j(B+5)\u22123}\nwhere j = 1, . . . ,m. We call Bj a range. Vertices in V1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a V3m must get a label\nin a range Bj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Note that for each range Bj , |Bj | = B + 2. Each range\nmust have at least two unused labels: Labels given to vertices in different sets Vi\nmust differ by at least two, and each |Vi| = ai < B\/2; thus each range contains either\nvertices from at least three sets Vi, and hence at least two unused labels, or vertices\nfrom at most two sets Vi, and hence at least B+2\u2212 2(B\/2\u2212 1\/2) = 3 unused labels.\nSince\n\u22113m\ni=1 |Vi| =\n\u22113m\ni=1 ai = mB =\n\u2211m\nj=1(|Bj | \u2212 2), there are exactly two unused\nlabels in each range Bj . For each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3m, consider the highest label \u0004i given\nto a vertex in Vi. The label \u0004i + 1 either does not belong to a range (this is true for\nexactly m such labels, as there are m ranges) or is an unused label in a range. Thus,\nevery unused label in a range is one larger than the highest label among all vertices\nin a set Vi, for some i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3m. As a consequence, all labels of a set Vi must be\nassigned to the same range. Now, let Aj be the set of values ai such that vertices of\nVi have their label in Bj . As Bj contains exactly B used labels, we have for each j,\u2211\nai\u2208Aj ai = B. This completes the proof.\nWe do not know whether p-RL(l) is NP-hard for cographs and leave it as one of\nthe open problems in the next section.\n7. Open problems. In this paper we initiated the study of two versions of the\nradio labeling problem in which a prelabeling is assumed. Many questions remain\nopen, a few of which are listed below:\n\u2022 We leave the complexity of any of the variants of Radio Labeling (RL,\np-RL(l), and p-RL(\u2217)) for interval graphs as open problems.\n\u2022 Another open problem concerns the computational complexity of p-RL(l)\n16 BODLAENDER, BROERSMA, FOMIN, PYATKIN, AND WOEGINGER\nfor cographs. Recall that NP-hardness of p-RL(\u2217) restricted to cographs is\nproved in this paper and that RL is polynomial for cographs.\n\u2022 Our results imply that p-RL(l) is polynomial for bipartite graphs. On the\nother hand, we proved that p-RL(\u2217) is NP-hard for 3-partite graphs even if\na 3-coloring of the graph is given. The complexity of p-RL(\u2217) for bipartite\ngraphs is open.\n\u2022 By Theorem 5.3, p-RL(l) is polynomial for planar graphs and graphs of\nbounded treewidth. The complexity of p-RL(\u2217) for these graph classes is\nopen.\nAcknowledgment. We are grateful to Dieter Kratsch for fruitful discussions on\nthe topic of this paper.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H. L.
