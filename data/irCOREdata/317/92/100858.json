INTRODUCTION\nNuclei near the N = Z line, in the 1f7\/2 shell, constitute\na privileged benchmark where several nuclear properties can\nbe studied in great detail. This is due to recent experimental\ndevelopments that have allowed spectroscopic studies of these\nnuclei at high spin. Near the center of the shell, collective\nfeatures such as rotational bands have been observed in several\nnuclei [1\u20133] up to the band termination. These structures\ncoexist with more spherical structures in some cases. When\napproaching the neutron or proton closed shells, single-particle\nbehavior shows up, which can give rise to high-spin isomeric\nstates [4,5]. In parallel to the experimental developments,\nimportant improvements have been made in shell-model\ncalculations that are able to describe, in the full fp-shell valence\nspace, the different properties of 1f7\/2-shell nuclei, including\nrotational phenomena, with very good accuracy [6]. Recently,\nthese investigations have been extended to isospin symmetry\nbreaking studies, which have allowed the understanding of\nspecific nuclear structure phenomena [7\u20139].\nThe study of odd-odd nuclei is very challenging because\nthey are particularly sensitive to the proton-neutron interaction.\nIn odd-odd N = Z nuclei, T = 0 and T = 1 states\ncoexist at low spin. Rotational positive-parity bands have been\nobserved near the middle of the shell, in 46V and 50Mn.\nThey are well described with the shell model taking into\naccount the whole pf shell [10\u201312]. Negative-parity structures\nhave been also observed in both nuclei. The rotational band\nobserved in 46V to the band terminating 17\u2212 state has been\nreproduced with shell-model calculations in the full pf space,\nallowing for one hole excitation in the d3\/2 shell. In the heavier\n50Mn, the negative-parity structure cannot be reproduced\nby these calculations and the inclusion of the upper sdg\nshell seems to be necessary, which is not feasible with the\ncurrent shell-model capabilities. For the odd-odd N = Z + 2\nnucleus 48V a complete spectroscopic study has been made by\nBrandolini et al. [13], where a precise description has been\nobtained with shell-model calculations for both positive- and\nnegative-parity states. Very scarce spectroscopic information\nhas been reported, however, beyond band termination in this\nmass region [14].\nIn the present work new experimental data on the odd-odd\nN = Z + 2 nucleus 52Mn are presented. High-spin states of\nboth positive- and negative-parity have been observed up to\nan excitation energy of \u223c16 MeV. Prior to the present work,\nthese studies were limited to the band-terminating 11+ state\nat 3836 keV. The description of the experimental techniques\nand findings are given in Sec. II. The experimental results are\ndiscussed in the framework of the shell model in Sec. III and\nthe conclusions are presented in Sec. IV.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND DATA ANALYSIS\nThe results presented in this article for the 52Mn nucleus\nwere extracted from three different experiments. The first\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(1)\/014303(8) 014303-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nM. AXIOTIS et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 014303 (2007)\nof them (EBN) was performed with the EUROBALL spec-\ntrometer, which was composed of 15 Cluster and 26 Clover\nHPGe detectors, equipped with BGO Compton suppression\nshields. In this experiment the EUROBALL spectrometer was\ncombined with the 4\u03c0 charged-particle detector ISIS [15],\nconsisting of 40 (\u0003E,E) Si telescopes, and the Neutron Wall\n[16], composed of 15 threefold segmented neutron detector\nunits and 1 fivefold, which covered a solid angle of 1\u03c0 . The\nreaction used was 28Si(28Si,3pn) at 110 MeV beam energy. A\n28Si target of 850 \u00b5g\/cm2 (enriched to >99.9%) evaporated\non a 15-mg\/cm2 gold backing was used. Data were recorded\nwhen at least two \u03b3 rays in the Ge detectors and a neutron\nin the Neutron Wall were detected in coincidence, or when\nat least three \u03b3 rays in the Ge detectors and a hit (either\nfrom a \u03b3 ray or from a neutron) in the Neutron Wall were\nin coincidence. We also examined data obtained in two other\nexperiments performed with the 4\u03c0 GASP gamma array [17],\nwhich consists of 40 Compton-suppressed large volume HPGe\ndetectors with a multiplicity filter of 80 BGO crystals, along\nwith the 4\u03c0 charged-particle detector ISIS. The reactions\nused were 24Mg(32S,3pn) at 130 MeV bombarding energy\nand 28Si(28Si,3pn) at 115 MeV beam energy. In the first\n(GASP-I) case the target was self-supported with a thickness of\n400 \u00b5g\/cm2, whereas in the second (GASP-II) a \u223c800 \u00b5g\/cm2\n28Si target (enriched to >99.9%) evaporated on a 13 mg\/cm2\ngold backing was used. In both cases events were recorded\nwhen at least two Ge detectors and two elements of the\nmultiplicity filter fired in coincidence.\nThe above mentioned experiments were performed at the\nXTU Tandem accelerator of the Legnaro National Laboratory.\nThe energy calibration and the efficiency correction were\nperformed using 56Co, 133Ba, and 152Eu sources.\nA. The level scheme\nFor the analysis of the EBN data a \u03b3 -\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence\ncube and \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence matrices were constructed, with\nand without conditions on the charged particles and neutrons.\nIn the upper part of Fig. 1 a spectrum of 52Mn \u03b3 rays obtained\nin coincidence with neutrons and the 870-keV (7+1 \u2192 6+)\ntransition is shown. With these data the positive-parity levels\nof 52Mn have been extended up to the 15+ state at 9.9 MeV. A\nnegative-parity structure was observed for the first time. The\nhigh-spin states, having very short lifetimes, decayed in flight\ninside the target backing producing for the resulting transitions\nvery broad lines in the spectra. Cleaner spectra for these lines\nwere obtained from the GASP-I data. In this case, in fact,\nrecoiling ions move in the vacuum and the Doppler shift of\nthe emitted \u03b3 rays can be accounted for. The lower panel of\nFig. 1 shows a GASP-I spectrum gated at the 870-keV \u03b3\ntransition and in coincidence with two protons.\nFrom this analysis the level scheme of 52Mn shown in Fig. 2\nwas deduced. A total of 25 new levels and 59 new \u03b3 transitions\nhave been added to the previously known level scheme [18].\nWe have also observed two transitions that we were not able\nto place in the level scheme: a transition of 2421 keV that\nseems to decay to the 7+1 state and a transition of 3004 keV\nthat decays probably to the 10+1 state.\nFIG. 1. Spectra obtained by applying a gate at the 870-keV\ntransition to the ground state. In the upper panel a spectrum from\nthe EBN data in coincidence with neutrons is shown, whereas in the\nlower panel a spectrum from the GASP-I experiment is presented, in\ncoincidence with two protons.\nThe intensities shown in the level scheme (see also Table I)\nhave been deduced from the thin-target (GASP-I) experiment,\nso as to avoid errors arising from the broad line shapes of\nthe thick target experiments. Spins and parities of the states\nin Fig. 2 have been determined by angular distribution and\npolarization analysis, as described below.\nB. Angular distribution, polarization, and\nlifetime measurements\nThe 40 Ge detectors of GASP are distributed in seven rings,\nat 34\u25e6 (six detectors), 60\u25e6 (six detectors), 72\u25e6 (four detec-\ntors), 90\u25e6 (eight detectors), 108\u25e6 (four detectors), 120\u25e6 (six\ndetectors), and 146\u25e6 (six detectors) with respect to the beam\naxis. To study the angular distributions seven \u03b3 -\u03b3 -coincidence\nmatrices were produced, having on the first axis the \u03b3 rays\ndetected in one ring and on the second, the ones detected in\nthe entire array. Making gates on the second axis, the angular\ndistributions of most of the transitions were obtained. These\ndistributions are practically unaffected by the coincidence\nrequirement, due to the approximate spherical symmetry of\nthe array. For this analysis data of the thin-target experiment\nwere used. Where possible, the angular distributions obtained\nin the EBN experiment were compared with the GASP data\nand were found in good agreement. The deduced spin values\nand mixing ratio of the \u03b3 rays are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I.\n014303-2\nHIGH-SPIN \u03b3 -RAY SPECTROSCOPY IN 52Mn PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 014303 (2007)\nTABLE I.

For these lines no intensities can be given. There\nare also some transitions for which, either because of the low intensity or for that they were seen in other experiment, it is not possible to give\nthe intensities.\nbThe branching ratios were obtained by gating above the transitions. Whenever making the gate was not possible the branching ratio is missing.\nFor the parity determination the polarization method was\nused. For this purpose two \u03b3 -\u03b3 matrices were produced. The\nfirst matrix included \u03b3 rays scattered perpendicularly to the\nbeam direction in the Clover detectors placed near 90\u25e6, in\ncoincidence with the \u03b3 rays detected in the rest of the array,\nwhereas the second one included the \u03b3 rays that were scattered\nparallel to the beam versus the entire \u03b3 array. The asymmetry\nof the Compton scattering is given by A = N\u22a5\u2212N\u2016\/N\u22a5+N\u2016.\nFrom these matrices the asymmetry of the Compton scattering\nwas calculated. Knowing that for stretched transitions, a\npositive asymmetry is associated to an electric multipole,\nwhereas a negative asymmetry to a magnetic one, the character\nof the lines was determined. All the information derived from\nthis analysis is given in Table I.\nTo estimate the lifetimes of the states the Doppler shift\nattenuation method has been used. For this purpose data from\nthe GASP-II experiment were sorted in seven \u03b3 -\u03b3 -coincidence\nmatrices, each corresponding to the coincidence of the \u03b3 rays at\nany detector of the seven rings with those at all other detectors.\nThe spectra taken by putting a gate on the 929-keV 11+1 \u2192\n9+1 transition were analyzed with the LINESHAPE [19] code,\ntaking into account the feeding from higher lying states. The\ndeduced lifetimes are reported in Table II. The low statistics\nof the transitions from the negative-parity states did not allow\na lifetime analysis for this part of the level scheme. However,\nmaking a gate on the 870-keV \u03b3 transition to the ground state\nwe have observed that the 1077-keV transition from the 9\u2212\nstate was observed without Doppler broadening, leading to the\nconclusion that the 9\u2212 state has a lifetime greater than 1.1 ps,\nwhich is the time needed for the recoil to be stopped in the\nbacking.\nTABLE II.

The 52Mn level scheme as obtained\nin the present work.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nThree main structures can be distinguished in the level\nscheme of 52Mn (see Fig. 2): the ground-state band, that\nterminates at the 11+1 state at 3836-keV excitation energy,\na high-spin positive-parity structure and a negative-parity one.\nThese structures have been analyzed in the framework of the\nspherical shell model.\nA. Positive-parity states\nTo describe these states, calculations have been performed\nin the full fp shell using the code ANTOINE [20]. The single\nparticle energies have been taken from the experimental\nspectrum of 41Ca. Four different effective interactions (KB3\n[21], KB3G [22], FPD6 [23], and GXPF1 [24]) have been used\nto calculate the energy levels of the ground-state band. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 3. From this figure, it can be deduced\nthat the GXPF1 interaction gives the best description of the\ndata. However, when extending the calculations to nonyrast or\nhigher spin states, these calculations underestimate the level\nenergies by 300\u2013500 keV. It is the KB3G interaction that gives\nan overall better description of the data, as shown in Fig. 4.\nWe have therefore adopted the KB3G interaction for the shell-\nmodel calculations in the following discussion. In addition to\nthe energy levels, where theory and experiment compare well,\nthe transition probabilities for the decay transitions have been\ncalculated and the corresponding branching ratios were found\nin good agreement with the data (see Table I).\nTo put in evidence the different characteristics of the\ntwo positive-parity structures\u2014at low and high-spin\u2014the\nfractional occupation numbers for the different orbitals in\nthe fp shell can be studied. The calculated values for\nthe yrast states, including the 11+2 level, are displayed in\nKB3 FPD6 GXPF1 Exp.

In the upper panel, the occupation numbers for the\nf7\/2 shell for protons and neutrons are shown.

In the bottom\npanel only the neutron occupations in the other orbitals of the\nmain shell are shown, as those for the protons are small and\nquite constant. An abrupt change of configuration is observed\nat the 11+2 state where a neutron is excited from the f7\/2 to the\nupper orbitals. This structure, with only six neutrons in the f7\/2\norbital, continues up to the 16+ state.

To\nfurther increase the spin to J\u03c0 = 17+, another neutron has to\nbe excited to the upper fp orbits.\nLately, high-spin states in the nucleus 51Mn have been\nreported [25,26]. To explain the yrast states above the 17\/2\u2212\nlevel, where a pair of neutrons is aligned to the maximum value\nof J\u03bd = 6, the alignment of five protons in the f7\/2 orbital up to\nJ\u03c0 = 15\/2 is addressed, where it reaches the fully aligned state\n27\/2\u2212. This behavior is very similar to the one observed here\nfor the ground-state band in 52Mn, where the maximum spin\nis J = 11 with the odd neutron in the f7\/2 orbital (J\u03bd = 7\/2)\ncoupled to the fully aligned J\u03c0 = 15\/2 spin of the protons. The\nrelevant part of the two level schemes are compared in the left\npart of Fig. 6 and in fact they look very similar. To get a better\ninsight into this feature, we have calculated the expectation\nvalue of the operator Ai = [(a+i a+i )J=6(aiai)J=6]0, where i\nstands for neutrons or protons. This operator \u201ccounts\u201d the\nnumber of nucleon pairs aligned to J = 6. By computing\nthe difference between the expectation values of neutrons and\nprotons for each state, one can get a \u201cpicture\u201d of which fluid is\naligning as a function of the spin. The results for both nuclei\nare compared in the right part of Fig. 6. In the case of 51Mn\nfor the low-spin states the alignment of the neutrons and the\nprotons is comparable, giving small contributions to A\u03bd \u2212A\u03c0 .\nThe abrupt rise of the curve at the 17\/2\u2212 state is caused by\nthe alignment of a neutron pair to J = 6. With the neutrons\nblocked in this configuration the increase of the spin can be\ngenerated only by the alignment of the protons (excluding\nexcitations to upper orbitals), as happens for the ground-state\nband in 52Mn. The similarity between the two curves, for the\nstates in question, is remarkable.\nFor the high-spin structure in 52Mn (starting with the 11+2\nup to 17+) the agreement between experiment and theory is\n014303-6\nHIGH-SPIN \u03b3 -RAY SPECTROSCOPY IN 52Mn PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 014303 (2007)\n51Mn\n52Mn\n9\/25\/2 13\/2 17\/2 21\/2 25\/2 29\/2 33\/2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n-0.2\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\nSpin\n4161\n3836\n2285\n2907\n870\n0\n1254\n325\n622\n2037\n1415\n2285\n870\n929\n7897\n7180\n5644\n6476\n4144\n3685\n1500\n458\n2331\n831\n705\n1422\n1958\n717\n6+\n8+\n10+\n7+\n9+\n11+\n25\/2-\n27\/2-\n23\/2-\n21\/2-\n19\/2-\n17\/2-\n51 Mn 52 Mn\n1876\nFIG. 6.

This leads\nus to believe that the configuration of the negative bandhead\n(9\u2212) corresponds to the coupling of an octupole vibration\nto the ground state, as observed in other neighboring nuclei\n(50Mn [12] and 52Fe [4]). In fact, in Fig. 7 the similarity of\nthe excitation energy of the negative-parity bandhead of the\nabove mentioned nuclei is shown. This could also explain\nthe competition of the octupole transition of 4679 keV to the\ndipole ones in the decay of the 9\u2212 state. Unfortunately, it is\nnot feasible to perform shell-model calculations that take into\naccount excitations to the g9\/2 shell.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, a full spectroscopic analysis for the odd-odd\nnucleus 52Mn has been carried out, achieving to extend the\nlevel scheme considerably above the band termination. The\npositive-parity part of the level scheme has been compared with\nfull fp shell-model calculations, using several interactions and\nfound in overall good agreement. In particular the interactions\nthat produce better results are the KB3G and the GXPF1, the\nformer being able to describe the whole positive-parity level\nscheme and the latter up to the ground-state band termination.\nIn addition, a negative-parity structure has been observed for\nthe first time. The description of this structure was not possible\nin the context of shell model, because taking into account the\ng9\/2 shell seems necessary, which for the time being is not\nfeasible. The bandhead of this structure is interpreted as an\noctupole vibration coupled to the ground state.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the technical staff of the LNL accelerator\ndivision for their support during the course of the experiments.\nM.A. acknowledges support by the EC under the contracts\nTMR\/LSF: ERBFMGECT 980110\u2014Access to Large Scale\nFacilities and HPRI-CT-1999-00083.\n014303-7\nM.
