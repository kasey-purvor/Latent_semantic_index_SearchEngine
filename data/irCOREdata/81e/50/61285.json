H. Gudmundsson (ghg@bas.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nLarge-scale ice sheet models commonly employ approxi-\nmations to the momentum equations for increased compu-\ntational efficiency. These approximations are derived from\nthe full-set of momentum equations through scaling analy-\nsis motivated by the size of some geometrical aspect ratios,\nsuch as ice thickness and ice-sheet span, and some expecta-\ntions about relative sizes of various stress terms. Currently,\nmost large-scale ice sheet models are based on two different\ntypes of approximations, which in this paper will be referred\nto as the shallow-ice-sheet (SSHEET) and the shallow-ice-\nstream (SSTREAM) approximations. The shallow-ice-sheet\napproximation corresponds to the situation where surface-\nparallel shear stress in a shallow ice sheet are large com-\npared to horizontal deviatoric stress. The shallow-ice-stream\napproximation, on the other hand, assumes that the vertical\nshear stress is small compared to all other stress components.\nBoth of these approximations use the shallow-ice approxi-\nmation, i.e. they describe flow over horizontal scales large\ncompared to the mean ice thickness. Derivations of the re-\nsulting theories, often using slightly different scaling argu-\nments, can be found, for example, in Hutter (1983), Morland\n(1984), Muszynski and Birchfield (1987), MacAyeal (1989),\nand Baral and Hutter (2001).\nIt is clearly of considerable importance to be able to quan-\ntify the errors introduced by these different approximations.\nThe derivations of the SSHEET and the SSTREAM approx-\nimations give some indications about their applicability to\ndifferent flow regimes. It follows, for example, from the scal-\nings used in the SSTREAM approximation that the slip ratio,\nthe ratio between mean basal motion and mean forward de-\nformational velocity, must be O(\u03b4\u22122), where \u03b4 is the ratio\nbetween typical thickness and horizontal span (see Appendix\nA). The errors are also expected to be of some order of the\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n78 G. H. Gudmundsson: Surface response in the shallow-ice-stream approximation\nratio between typical ice-thickness and horizontal scales of\nthe problem. For example, for the SSTREAM approxima-\ntion the errors are O(\u03b42). For a given problem of interest to\na modeller it is, however, generally difficult if not impossible\nto come up with firm quantitative estimates of those errors.\nA straightforward possibility of assessing the applicability\nof these approximations to situations commonly encountered\nin glaciology is to compare solutions to those obtained by\nusing the full-system momentum-balance equations (FS so-\nlutions). However, although possible in principle, the com-\nputational cost of a FS solution makes this approach, in most\ncases, impractical. A promising solution to this problem\nhas been suggested by Hindmarsh (2004) who performed\na computational analysis of various approximations used in\nglaciology by comparing flow disturbances set up by small\nperturbations in the ice surface. Focusing on small-amplitude\nperturbations reduces computational times making direct es-\ntimates of absolute errors feasible. Another advantage that\ncomes from analysing small-amplitude solutions is the added\ninsight they can give into the nature of the approximations.\nFrom the scaling analysis of the SSTREAM approximation\nit is, for example, far from obvious how the relationship be-\ntween bed and surface differs from that given by the SSHEET\napproximation, and how those descriptions in turn differ\nfrom the one given by the FS theory. One of the key ad-\nvantages to come from analysing effects of small-amplitude\nperturbations on flow is that by doing so fairly general an-\nswers to these questions can be given.\nHere I present new analytical solutions to the shallow\nSSTREAM equations based on small-amplitude perturbation\nanalysis and compare them with corresponding FS analyti-\ncal solutions given in Gudmundsson (2003) and Jo\u00b4hannesson\n(1992). Comparisons with analytical solutions based on the\nSSHEET approximation are also made. The solutions are\nvalid for linear medium and small-amplitude perturbations in\nsurface topography, bed topography, and basal slipperiness.\n2 Linear perturbation analysis of the shallow-ice-\nstream approximation\nThe method of comparing these solutions followed here is\nto cast them in the form of transfer functions. These trans-\nfer functions describe the transient response of the medium\nto perturbations in bed topography, surface geometry, and\nbasal slipperiness. The starting point is the well-known\nshallow-ice-stream equations (MacAyeal, 1989). The deriva-\ntion of these equations is outlined in Appendix A. Further\nexamples of their derivations, using slightly different scaling\narguments, can be found elsewhere (e.g. MacAyeal, 1989;\nSchoof, 2006).\nThe analysis is done in a coordinate system tilted forward\nin the x direction by the angle \u03b1, the mean surface slope. As\nshown in Appendix A the shallow-ice-stream scalings results\nin\n\u2202x(4h\u03b7\u2202xu+2h\u03b7\u2202yv)+\u2202y(h\u03b7(\u2202xv+\u2202yu))\u2212(u\/c)1\/m\n=\u03c1gh\u2202xs cos\u03b1\u2212\u03c1gh sin\u03b1, (1)\n\u2202y(4h\u03b7\u2202yv+2h\u03b7\u2202xu)+\u2202x(h\u03b7(\u2202yu+\u2202xv))\u2212(v\/c)1\/m\n=\u03c1gh\u2202ys cos\u03b1, (2)\nwhich are two coupled partial differential equations for the\ndepth-independent horizontal velocity components u and v.\nIn these equation s is the surface, h is the ice thickness, \u03b7\nis the effective ice viscosity, \u03c1 the ice density, and c is the\nbasal slipperiness. The parameter m and the basal slipperi-\nness c are parameters in the sliding law defined by Eq. (A5)\nin Appendix A.\nFor a linear viscous medium (n=1) and a non-linear slid-\ning law (m arbitrary but positive) these equations can be lin-\nearised and solved analytically using standard methods. We\nwrite f=f\u00af+1f , where f stands for some relevant variable\nentering the problem, and look for a zeroth-order solution\nwhere f\u00af is independent of x and y and time t , while the first-\norder field 1f is small but can be a function of space and\ntime.\nThe perturbations in bed topography (1b) and basal slip-\nperiness (1c) are step functions of time. They are applied at\nt=0, i.e. for t<0 we have 1b=0 and 1c=0. For t\u22650 both\n1b and 1c are some nonzero functions of x and y. Using\nthis history definition, the solutions for the velocity field and\nthe surface geometry become functions of time. The pur-\npose of introducing time varying basal perturbations is to be\nable to study the transient response of the surface to temporal\nchanges in basal conditions. As shown below the transient\nresponse is determined by two timescales: the phase time\nscale (tp), and the relaxation time scale (tr ). Both of these\ntimescales are independent of the particular time history used\nfor the basal perturbations. They are also independent of the\nnature of the basal perturbation, i.e. exactly the same expres-\nsions are obtained for tp and tr for a perturbation in basal\ntopography as for a perturbation in basal slipperiness. Using\nthe superposition principle, solutions for more complicated\ntime histories can easily be constructed.\n2.1 Bed topography perturbations\nWe start by considering the response to small perturbation\nin basal topography (1b). Writing h=h\u00af+1h, s=s\u00af+1s,\nb=b\u00af+1b, where h is ice thickness, s surface topography,\nand b bed topography, and u=u\u00af+1u, v=1v,w=1w, where\nu, v, and w are the x, y, and z components of the velocity\nvector, respectively, and c=c\u00af where c is the basal slipperi-\nness (see Eq. A5), inserting into (1) and (2) and solving the\nresulting equations gives the zeroth-order solution\nu\u00af = c\u00af\u03c1gh\u00af sin\u03b1.

This is done by writing\nf=f\u00af+1f+\u2202zf\u00af 1z where f is any given term that enters\nthe boundary conditions, and 1z is either 1s or 1b.\nTo first order, the upper and lower boundary kinematic\nconditions are\n\u2202t1s + u\u00af \u2202x1s \u22121w = 0, (8)\nand\nu\u00af \u2202x1b \u22121w = 0, (9)\nrespectively. In (8) the surface mass-balance perturbation has\nbeen set to zero. The jump conditions for the stress tensor\nhave already been used in the derivation of (1) and (2) and\ndo not need to be considered further.\nThis system of equations is solved using standard Fourier\nand Laplace transform methods. All variables are Fourier\ntransformed with respect to the spatial variables x and y and\nLaplace transformed with respect to the time variable t . In\nthe forward Fourier transform the two space variables both\ncarry a positive sign, and the wavenumbers in x and y di-\nrection are denoted by k and l, respectively. In the forward\nLaplace transform the time variable carries a negative sign,\nand the complex Laplace argument is denoted by the variable\nr .\nThe Fourier and Laplace transforms of the first order field\nEqs.

The Fourier transformed mass-conservation\nequation is\n\u2212 ik 1u\u2212 il 1v + \u2202z1w = 0. (12)\nEquations (10) to (12) can now be solved for 1u, 1v and\n\u2202z1w.

(14) using contour\nintegration leads to\nTsb(k, l, t) = ik(u\u00af\u03be + \u03c4d)\np\u03be\n(ept \u2212 1). (20)\nThis transfer function describes the relation between surface\nand bed topography, where\n1s(k, l, t)=Tsb(k, l, t)1b(k, l). (21)\nOther transfer functions are defined in an analogous manner.\nIn Gudmundsson (2003) the relaxation time scale is re-\nferred to as the decay time scale and denoted by td . As\npointed out by Hindmarsh (2004), depending on the situa-\ntion, the term \u201cgrowth rate\u201d is presumably more descriptive.\nHere the term \u201crelaxation time scale\u201d will be used as the time\nscale tr determines how long it takes for the transient solution\nto \u201crelax\u201d toward the steady-state limit.\nThe relationship between surface velocity and bed topog-\nraphy is found to be given by\nTwb = k(ku\u00af\u2212 ept (ip + ku\u00af))(u\u00af\u03be + \u03c4d)(p\u03be)\u22121, (22)\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/ The Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008\n80 G.

In Appendix B the\nsolution procedure is outlined and expressions for the corre-\nsponding transfer functions listed.\n2.3 Surface perturbations\nWe now determine the transient evolution of a surface un-\ndulation prescribed at t=0. By writing h=h\u00af+1s, s=s\u00af+1s,\nb=b\u00af, u=u\u00af+1u, v=1v, w=1w, and c=c\u00af, inserting into (1)\nand (2) and solving the resulting equations together with (12)\nand the kinematic boundary condition at the surface\nw = r1s \u2212 iku\u00af1s \u2212 s(t = 0),\nit is found that the surface evolution as a function of time is\ngiven by\ns(k, l, t) = Tss0s(k, l, t = 0), (26)\nwhere\nTss0 = ep t . (27)\nThe velocity components are given by\nTws0 = (ik \u2212 j2h\u00af cot\u03b1)\u03c4d\u03be\u22121 ep t , (28)\nTus0 =\n\u03c4d(\u03b3 (1 + \u03c8)+ h\u00af\u03b7(j2\u03c8 + k2 + 4l2))\nh\u00af\u03bd\u03be\nept , (29)\nwhere\n\u03c8 = ikh\u00af cot\u03b1, (30)\nand\nTvs0 =\nil(3ik\u03b7 + \u03bd cot\u03b1)\u03c4d\n\u03bd\u03be\nep t . (31)\n2.4 Non-dimensional forms of the transfer functions\nThe transfer functions listed above are all in dimensional\nform. It is often much more convenient to work with the\ntransfer functions in a non-dimensional form. For this pur-\npose the same scalings as used in Gudmundsson (2003) will\nbe employed. The velocity is given in units of mean de-\nformational velocity of the full-system solution. All spa-\ntial scales are in units of mean ice thickness (h\u00af), and stress\ncomponents in units of driving stress (\u03c4d ). It follows from\nthese scalings that the non-dimensional viscosity, E, is given\nbyE=u\u00afd\u03b7\/(h\u00af\u03c4d)=1\/2, and the mean non-dimensional basal\nslipperiness C\u00af is\nC\u00af = c\u00af \u03c4md \/u\u00afd = u\u00afb\/u\u00afd .\nThe mean non-dimensional slipperiness is therefore equal\nto the slip ratio, i.e. the ratio between mean basal sliding\nvelocity (u\u00afb) and the mean forward deformational velocity\n(u\u00afd ). One obtains the non-dimensional form of the transfer\nfunctions from the dimensional one using the substitutions\nc\u00af 7\u2192 C\u00af, \u03b7 7\u2192 1\/2, h\u00af 7\u2192 1, u\u00af 7\u2192 C\u00af, k 7\u2192 k, l 7\u2192 l,\n\u03b3 7\u2192 (mC\u00af)\u22121, and \u03c1gh\u00af sin\u03b1 7\u2192 1.\nNote that since in the shallow-ice-stream approximation\nu\u00afd=O(\u03b42) and we are ignoring all fields to this order, we\nhave u\u00af 7\u2192 C and not u\u00af 7\u2192 C+1 as is the case for the full-\nsystem solutions and the solutions of the shallow-ice-sheet\napproximation. Furthermore, from C\u00af = u\u00afb\/u\u00afd it follows\nthat C\u00af = O(\u03b4\u22122). In these non-dimensional units, the re-\nquirement that the slip ratio is O(\u03b4\u22122) for the shallow-ice-\nstream approximation to be valid implies C\u00af+1\u2248C\u00af or C\u00af\u001d1\nfor small surface slopes.\nIn non-dimensional form the solutions often take a con-\nsiderably simpler shape. For example the non-dimensional\nforms of the timescales tp and tr , and the transfer function\nTsb are, respectively,\ntr = (2 + (j2mC\u00af)\u22121) tan\u03b1,\nt\u22121p = kC\u00af(1 +\nm\n1 + 2j2mC\u00af ),\nand\nTsb = k(1 + (1 + 2j\n2C\u00af)m)\nk +m(k + 2kj2C\u00af + ij2 cot\u03b1)(1 \u2212 e\nit\/tpe\u2212t\/tr ).\nNote that in all of these three expressions, the short wave-\nlength limit (k and l\u2192+\u221e) is independent of the sliding law\nexponent m.\n3 Discussion\nThe main subject of the following discussion is a compari-\nson of various SSHEET, SSTREAM and FS small-amplitude\nsolutions. The SSHEET solutions are known for non-linear\nmedium and a non-linear sliding law (Nye, 1960; Fowler,\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/\nG. H.

The surface slope is \u03b1=0.005 and slip ratio\nC\u00af=30 and n=m=1. The unit on the y axis is the mean surface\nvelocity of the full-system solution (u\u00af=C\u00af+1=31).\n1982; Jo\u00b4hannesson, 1992). Small-amplitude FS solutions\nhave so far only been derived for linear medium and a lin-\near sliding law (Reeh, 1987; Jo\u00b4hannesson, 1992; Gudmunds-\nson, 2003). The SSTREAM solutions, derived here for the\nfirst time, are valid for linear medium and a non-linear slid-\ning law. It follows that direct comparision betweeen the\nSSTREAM and the FS solutions can only be done for n=1\nand m=1, and for this reason most of the discussion is lim-\nited to this case. The only exception is a brief description\ngiven below of the relationship between bed and surface ge-\nometry in the SSTREAM approximation for non-linear slid-\ning law. A full discussion of the non-linear aspects of the\nsolutions will be done elsewhere.\n3.1 Time scales\nAs seen from the solutions listed above and in Appendix B\nthe transient behaviour is completely determined by two time\nscales: the phase time scale tp, and the relaxation time scale\ntr . The term \u201cphase time scale\u201d is used for tp because it de-\ntermines how quickly the phase of the surface fields changes\nwith time (see for example Eqs. 26 and 27). As mentioned\nabove the tr time scale determines how quickly the solutions\n\u201crelax\u201d toward the steady-state limit.\nThe properties of the phase time scale can most easily be\nunderstood by looking at the phase velocity vp which is, by\ndefinition, given by vp=((ktp)\u22121, (ltp)\u22121).

The angle \u03b8 is the angle between the\nwave vector k=(k, l) and the x axis. This is also the angle\nbetween the x axis and a vector lying in the xy plane and\nnormal to the crests of the sinusoidal perturbations. We have\ncos \u03b8=k\/j and \u03bb=2pi\/j where \u03bb is the wavelength.\nIt is instructive to compare phase speeds for different ap-\nproximations. Figure 1a shows the phase speed for \u03b8=0 as\na function of wavelength for the shallow-ice-stream approx-\nimation (dashed line), the shallow-ice-sheet approximation\n(dashed-dotted line), and for the full-system solution (solid\nline) for m=1 and n=1. Note that in the figure the phase\nspeeds have been normalised by the surface velocity as given\nby the full-system solution (equal to C\u00af+1 in non dimensional\nunits).\nIn the shallow-ice-sheet (SSHEET) approximation the\nphase speed (dashed-dotted curve in Fig. 1a) is, for \u03b8 fixed,\nindependent of the wavelength. For \u03b8=0 the SSHEET phase\nspeed is (n+1)ud+(m+1)ub, where ud is the deformational\nvelocity and ub the basal sliding velocity. This is a well\nknown (Nye, 1960) and often used expression for the speed\nof surface waves of on glaciers. The long-wavelength limit of\nthe SSHEET phase speed is correct, but the short wavelength\nSSHEET limit is incorrect. The FS limit for \u03b8=0 as \u03bb\u21920 is\n|vp|=ud + ub, i.e. for short wavelengths the kinematic wave\nspeed equals the surface velocity.\nAs can be seen from direct inspection of Eqs. (32) and\nEq. (90) in Gudmundsson (2003) \u2013 giving |vp| for the\nSSTREAM and the FS theories, respectively \u2013 and as illus-\ntrated by Fig. 1a, the SSTREAM phase speed (dashed curve)\nis quite similar to the FS phase speed for C\u00af\u001d1.

The\nplot has been normalised with the non-dimensional surface velocity\nu\u00af=C\u00af+1=101 of the full-system solution.\nphase speed given by Eq. (32), valid for any positive m and\nn=1, is not independent of \u03bb. The \u03bb\u2192+\u221e SSTREAM limit\nis |vp|=u\u00af(1+m) cos \u03b8 , which agrees with the FS limit for\nud=0. For \u03bb \u2192 0 the SSTREAM phase speed is equal to\nthe mean surface speed, again in an agreement with the FS\ntheory. Hence, in both the \u03bb\u21920 and the \u03bb\u2192+\u221e limits, the\nSSHEET phase speed is equal to the FS phase speed.\nThe differences between the FS and the SSTREAM phase\nspeeds are small for parameter values typical of an active ice\nstream. This can be seen most easily from direct inspection\nof the differences between tp given by Eq. (16) and Eq. (73)\nin Gudmundsson (2003). Figures 2a and b show the FS and\nthe SSTREAM phase speeds (|vp|), respectively, as a func-\ntions of both wavelength \u03bb and the angle \u03b8 for C\u00af=100 and\n\u03b1=0.002. For \u03bb held constant the phase speed decreases\nmonotonically as function of \u03b8 and, as expected, goes to zero\nas \u03b8 \u2192 pi\/2. Comparison of Fig. 2a and b reveals only minor\ndifferences.\nThe wavelength dependency of the phase velocity gives\nrise to dispersion in the FS and the SSTREAM solutions.\nIn these theories it is therefore somewhat misleading to in-\nterpret the phase velocity as the velocity by which surface\ndisturbances propagate. The group velocity is a better mea-\nsure of this velocity, and as shown in Gudmundsson (2003)\nthe FS group velocity can be significantly different from the\nphase velocity and for some wavelengths even smaller than\nthe material surface velocity.\nlog\n10\n(\u03bb) (h\u00af)\n\u03b8 \n \n \n(de\ng.)\n \n \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\nFig. 2b.

(34)\nThe x component of the group velocity is shown in Fig. 1b\nfor m=1 as a function of wavelength for the same surface\nslope and slip ratio values as used in Fig. 1a. The figure\nshows that the SSTREAM expression for ug is a much better\napproximation to the FS solution than the one given by the\nSSHEET approximation. In fact the SSHEET group veloc-\nity does not look anything like the FS solution, whereas the\nSSTREAM solution traces the FS solution quite accurately\n(see Fig. 1b). Note also that, for the particular values of sur-\nface slope and slipperiness used in the Fig. 1b, the group ve-\nlocity is smaller than the mean surface speed for wavelength\nbetween 8 to 50 mean ice thicknesses.\nIn Fig. 3 the relaxation time scale (tr ) is plotted in dimen-\nsional units (years) as a function of wavelength for C\u00af=100\nand \u03b1=0.002 and m=1. (Note that the relaxation time does\nnot depend on the angle \u03b8 .) As indicated by the figure, and\ndirect inspection of the corresponding equations shows, the\nSSTREAM relaxation time scale closely approximates the\nFS relaxation time scale down to wavelengths of about 10\nice thicknesses. Of particular interest is the fact that in ac-\ncordance with the full-system solution, but in contrast to the\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/\nG. H.

The relaxation time scale (tr ) as a function of wavelength\n\u03bb. The wavelength is given in units of mean ice thickness (h\u00af) and\ntr is given in years. The mean surface slope is \u03b1=0.002, the slip\nratio is C\u00af=999, and n=m=1. For these values tr is on the order\nof 10 years for a fairly wide range of wavelengths. Lowering the\nslip ratio will reduce the value of tr . It follows that ice streams will\nreact to sudden changes in basal properties or surface profile by a\ncharacteristic time scale of a few years.\nSSHEET approximation, there is a range of wavelengths over\nwhich the SSTREAM relaxation time scale is independent of\n\u03bb (see Fig. 3). The only qualitative aspect of tr not captured\nby the SSTREAM approximation is the increases in tr with\n\u03bb decreasing for \u03bb less than about ten ice thicknesses. For\nC\u00af\u001d1 the expression for tr given by the SSTREAM solution\nis a much better approximation to tr than the one given by the\nSSHEET solution. For the particular set of parameters used\nin Fig. 3 both the SSTREAM and the FS solutions give, for\nthe range 10h\u00af<\u03bb<100h\u00af, a constant value for tr on the order\nof ten years. The SSHEET solution gives, for the same range\nvalues, estimates of tr ranging from hours to days.\nOf the two time scales tr and tp it can be argued that tr is\nthe more important one. A surface wave will travel a distance\nequal to its wavelength in the time 2pitp. In the same time its\namplitude will decrease by the factor e2pitp\/tr (See Eq. 27).\nThe ratio 2pitp\/tr , thus, can be thought of as giving the rela-\ntive importance of relaxation\/diffusion to wave propagation.\nAs pointed out by Jo\u00b4hannesson (1992) this ratio is, for typ-\nical situations encountered in glaciology, usually larger than\none. It follows that the time scale for local mass redistribu-\ntion on glaciers and ice sheets is essentially given by tr , and\ntakes place much faster than the time scale tp would suggest.\nThe close agreement between tr as given by the FS and the tr\nas calculated on basis of the SSTREAM approximation gives\nadded confidence in the applicability of the SSTREAM ap-\nproximation to situations typical of active ice streams.\n10\u22121 100 101 102 103 104\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n\u03bb (h)\nT s\nb \n(h)\n \n \nShallow Ice Stream\nApproximation\nFull System\nSolution\nShallow Ice Sheet \nApproximation\nFig. 4.

The figure\nshows the FS, the SSHEET, and the SSTREAM transfer\namplitudes, respectively (based on Eqs. 82 and 26 in Gud-\nmundsson, 2003, and Eq. 20). Surface slope (\u03b1=0.002) and\nslip ratio (C\u00af=100) values are typical for active ice streams.\nThe three curves differ in a number of important ways.\nThe steady-state SSHEET transfer amplitude (dotted line\nin Fig. 4) is a strictly increasing function of wavelength and\ndoes not show the pronounced peak in bed-to-surface transfer\nfor wavelengths from about 1 to 10 ice thicknesses seen in FS\nsolution (solid line).\nThe SSTREAM solution (dashed line) overestimates the\ntransfer at short wavelengths and gives a physically wrong\nlimit of |Tsb| \u2192 1 for \u03bb\u21920. Despite the incorrect limit\nfor \u03bb \u2192 0, the SSTREAM solution for Tsb is, and this is\ngenerally the case for high slip ratios, a considerably bet-\nter approximation to the FS solution than the corresponding\nSSHEET solution. For the particular set of values used in\nFig. 4 the SSTREAM solution agrees within a few percent to\nthe FS solution down to wavelengths of about eight ice thick-\nnesses, while the SSHEET solution is only similarly accurate\nfor wavelengths larger than about 100 ice thicknesses.\nFrom Eq.

The\nvalue of C\u00af=100 used in Fig. 4 can hardly be considered very\nlarge for typical active ice streams, and if a value of C\u00af=1000\nis used together with typical surface slopes of about 0.002\nto 0.004, it follows that |Tsb| is fairly close to unity for all\nwavelengths.\nThe minimum in the SSTREAM transfer amplitude given\nby Eq. (35) is reached for the wavelength\n\u03bbx = 2pi\n\u221a\n2C\u00afm\n1 +m, (36)\nwhere k\u03bbx=2pi , and the minimum is given by\nmin\nk\n|Tsb| = 1\u221a\n1 + m cot2 \u03b18C\u00af(1+m)\n. (37)\nFor bed topography variations aligned transversely to the\nmain flow direction, the steady-state ratio between surface\nand bed topography amplitudes is in the SSTREAM approx-\nimation always larger than that given by Eq. (37). The wave-\nlength given by Eq. (36) does not depend on surface slope\n\u03b1. As Fig. 4 suggests, the (global) minimum in SSTREAM\ntransfer amplitude (|Tsb|) closely approximates the corre-\nsponding (local) minimum of the FS transfer amplitude for\nC\u00af\u001d1.\nExamples for non-steady Tsb amplitudes are shown in\nFig. 5. The dashed lines in the figure are calculated us-\ning Eq. (20) and are based on the shallow-ice-stream ap-\nproximation, using the additional small-amplitude assump-\ntion 1b\/h\u00af\u001c1. The solid lines are FS solutions calculated\nusing Eq. (82) in Gudmundsson (2003). The times are given\nin non-dimensional units. These can be translated to di-\nmensional units through multiplication with h\u00af\/u\u00afd , where\nu\u00afd is the mean deformational velocity. As an example,\nfor a 1000 m thick ice stream where the surface velocity is\n1 m d\u22121, t=0.001 corresponds to about 3.3 months.\nThe figure shows the relatively slow increase in |Tsb| with\ntime for long wavelengths (larger than about 100 mean ice\nthicknesses) toward the steady-state long-wavelength limit of\n|Tsb|=1. The rate of increase toward the steady-state limit\nis determined by tr which, for long wavelengths, increases\nquadratically as a function of wavelength (see Eq. 17 and\nFig. 3), hence the slow increases in |Tsb| for long wave-\nlengths. Over wavelengths less than about 5 mean ice thick-\nnesses the SSTREAM relaxation time is smaller than the FS\nrelaxation time (see Fig. 3). Consequently, over this range\nof wavelengths the SSTREAM amplitudes grow faster with\ntime than the FS amplitudes. Another noticeable aspect of\nFig. 5 is the oscillating behaviour of the transfer amplitudes\nwith wavelength. These are caused by temporal fluctua-\ntions (kinematic oscillations) in |Tsb| that are governed by\nthe phase time scale tp. As the figure shows, transient am-\nplitudes can be larger than unity, and when this happens sur-\nface topography amplitudes are larger than the bed topogra-\nphy amplitudes. As follows from inspection of Eq. (20) and\nEq. (82) in Gudmundsson (2003), kinematic oscillation are\nparticularly pronounced for 0<t<tr whenever tp<tr . The\nconsequence can be an up to twofold increase in transfer\namplitudes as compared to the corresponding steady-state\nlimit. As mentioned above, the steady-state \u03bb\u21920 limit of\nthe SSTREAM Tsb amplitude is unity, and for short wave-\nlengths (\u03bb\/h\u00af<1) the transient value can be as large as two,\nwhereas the correct value for these wavelengths (as given by\nthe FS solution) is always close to zero.\nThe Tsb transfer amplitudes in Figs. 4 and 5 are plot-\nted as functions of longitudinal wavelength, that is for si-\nnusoidal variations in bed topography aligned transversely\nto the main flow direction. This corresponds to the situa-\ntion \u03b8=0. Figure 6a and b show the SSTREAM and the\nFS transfer amplitudes, respectively, as functions of both \u03b8\nand \u03bb. As Fig. 4 showed for \u03b8=0, the main difference be-\ntween the SSTREAM and the FS Tsb amplitudes is the short-\nwavelength limit. Irrespectively of \u03b8 the SSTREAM short-\nwavelength limit is always equal to unity, whereas the correct\nlimit is zero. The only exception is for the \u03b8 = pi\/2 where\nboth transfer functions are identically zero.\nIn Fig. 7a and b the Tub transfer amplitudes of, respec-\ntively, the SSTREAM and FS solutions are shown in a non-\ndimensionalised form. A simple way of interpreting the nu-\nmerical contour values is to think of them as ratios between\nmean deformational velocity and mean ice thickness (u\u00afd\/h\u00af).\nIn the figures, a slip ratio of 99 is used and the mean sur-\nface FS velocity is equal to 100 u\u00afd . For example, a transfer\namplitude equal to 50 implies that a sinusoidal bed topog-\nraphy perturbation with an amplitude corresponding to 10%\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/\nG.

For\n\u03b8=pi\/4 the SSTREAM transfer amplitude |Tvb| has one lo-\ncal maximum as function of \u03bb but the FS solution two. Again\nthe SSTREAM Tvb amplitudes are somewhat underestimated\nwhen the shallow-ice condition \u03bb\/h\u00af\u001d1 is not fulfilled. For\nthe particular set of parameters using in Fig. 7a and b, and\nFig. 8a and b the SSTREAM approximation underestimates\nthe effects of bed perturbations on surface velocities for\nwavelengths less than about 10 ice thicknesses.\n3.2.1 Surface topography and non-linear sliding\nThe discussion given above has mostly dealt with the n=1\nand m=1 case. In Fig. 9 the SSHEET and the SSTREAM\nratios between surface and bed topography amplitude (|Tsb|)\nare plotted for m=1 and m=3 for n=1. In addition the FS\nratio is shown for m=1. There are no analytical FS solutions\nknown for m 6= 1. The SSTREAM ratios shown (blue lines\nin Fig. 9) follow from Eq. (20), the FS ratio (black line) from\nEq. (82) in Gudmundsson (2003), and the SSHEET ratios\n(red lines) from Eq. (4.4.7) in Jo\u00b4hannesson (1992).\nAs the Jo\u00b4hannesson (1992) thesis is presumably not widely\navailable I list here his SSHEET expression for the Tsb trans-\nfer function. It is particularly simple and valid for any value\nof n and m. It can be written in the form\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/\nG. H. Gudmundsson: Surface response in the shallow-ice-stream approximation 87\nTsb = ii \u2212 \u03bb?\/\u03bb, (39)\nwhere\n\u03bb? =\n(\nn(n+1)\nn+2 +mC\u00af\n)\nn+ 1 + C\u00af(m+ 1) cot\u03b1, (40)\nis in units of mean ice thickness. The long and the short\nwavelength limits of SSHEET transfer amplitude as given by\nEq. (39) are independent of n and m, and the range of wave-\nlengths where the transfer is, in absolute terms, significantly\ndependent on n and m is determined by the value of \u03bb?. For\nmoderate values of n and high slip ratios (C\u00af \u001d 1) we have\n\u03bb? \u2248 m\nm+ 1 cot\u03b1.\nHence, the surface slope is the most important parameter af-\nfecting the SSHEET bed-to-surface transfer characteristics\nfor high slip ratios and the transfer is only moderately af-\nfected by the value of m.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Fig. 9 is that the\ndifferences between the m=1 and the m=3 cases are only of\nany significance for wavelengths longer than about 100 ice\nthicknesses. This is the case for both the SSHEET and the\nSSTREAM solutions. By analysing the SSTREAM trans-\nfer function given by Eq. (20) it is found that the sensitivity\nof |Tsb| to m is small at both large and small wavelengths\nand decreases with decreasing slope. In particular, for wave-\nlengths smaller than the wavelength for which the minimum\nin SSTREAM amplitude is reached (see Eq. 36), the transfer\namplitudes are not significantly affected by the value of the\nsliding law exponent m.\nNo analytical FM solutions for m>1 are known, but\na numerical study by Raymond and Gudmundsson (2005)\nshowed that changing m from 1 to 3 has almost no effect on\nFS transfer amplitudes for wavelengths smaller than \u03bb given\nby Eq. 36. The insensitivity of Tsb to the value of the sliding\nlaw exponent m for wavelengths smaller than the one given\nby Eq. (36) may, thus, well be a general feature of glacier\nflow. Schoof (2005) gives arguments suggesting that at high\nslip ratios the surface response becomes independent of the\nform of the sliding law. The results presented here, and those\nof Raymond and Gudmundsson (2005), show this only to be\na good approximation for a limited set of wavelengths. The\nsource of the discrepancy is not entirely clear, but possibly\ndue to the implicit assumption in Schoof (2005) that shear\nstress is independent of short-scale perturbations in basal ve-\nlocities (Eq. 3 in Schoof, 2005). On length scales on the\norder of one ice thickness or smaller Schoof (2005) results\nagree favourably with those presented here.\n101 102 103 104\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\n\u03bb (h\u00af)\n|T\ns\nc\n|\n(h\u00af\n)\n \n \nFull System Solution\nShallow Ice Stream Approximation\nShallow Ice Sheet Approximation C=10\nC=1\nC=1 and C=10\nFig. 10.

In the plot the SSTREAM curves for C\u00af=1 and C\u00af=10 are\ntoo similar to be distinguished. The surface slope is 0.002.\n3.3 Basal slipperiness perturbations\nWe now consider the effects of spatial variations in basal slip-\nperiness on surface fields. Basal slipperiness is here defined\nas the function c(x, y) in the basal sliding law (see Eq. A5).\nThe non-dimensional slipperiness is written using an upper\ncase letter (i.e. C(x, y)). We have C(x, y)=c(x, y)\u03c4d\/u\u00afd ,\nand write C(x, y)=C\u00af(1+1C(x, y)) where C\u00af is the spa-\ntially averaged slipperiness and 1C(x, y) the (fractional)\nslipperiness perturbation introduced at t=0. The transfer\nfunctions listed in Appendix B give the relationships be-\ntween surface fields and the basal slipperiness perturba-\ntion 1C(x, y) in frequency space. We have, for example,\ns(k, l, t)=Tsc1C(k, l). Again our main focus here is on the\ndifferences between the corresponding SSHEET, SSTREAM\nand the FS solutions and therefore the discussion is mostly\nlimited to them=1 and n=1 case where small-amplitude an-\nalytical solutions to all of FS, SSHEET, and the SSTREAM\nproblems are available.\nFigure 10 shows basal-slipperiness to surface geometry\ntransfer amplitudes (Tsc) based on Eq. (B3) (circles) for the\nSSTREAM theory. For comparison the predictions of the\nFS (solid lines ) and the SSHEET (crosses) theories (Eqs. 83\nand 27 in Gudmundsson, 2003) for the same parameter set\nare shown as well. Because the SSTREAM solution does\nnot include the contribution of internal ice deformation to\nthe forward surface velocity, the SSTREAM and the FS long\nwavelength limits for |Tsc| are not equal. Both the FS and the\nSSHEET long wavelength limits (\u03bb\u2192\u221e for \u03b8=0) are equal\nto C\u00af\/(2(1+C\u00af)). For the SSTREAM solution this limit is, on\nthe other hand, equal to 1\/2 independently of C\u00af (see Eq. B7).\nFor C\u00af\u001d1 these two different expressions, of course, give nu-\nmerically quite similar answers.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/ The Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008\n88 G. H.

Steady-state response of surface longitudinal (u), trans-\nverse (v), and vertical (w) velocity components to a basal slipper-\niness perturbation. The surface slope is 0.002 and the slip ratio\nC\u00af=10. The Tuc and Twc amplitudes are calculated for slipperiness\nperturbations aligned transversely to the flow direction (\u03b8=0). For\nTvc, \u03b8=45 degrees. Of the two y axis the scale to the left is for the\nhorizontal velocity components (Tuc and Twc), and the one to the\nright is the scale for Tuc.\nFigure 11 shows the velocity transfer amplitudes |Tuc|,\n|Tvc|, and |Twc|. Shown are both the FS solutions (solid lines)\nand those based on the SSTREAM approximation (dashed\nlines). The SSTREAM solutions are given by Eqs. (B4), (B5)\nand (B6). The FS solutions can be found, or easily derived,\nfrom Gudmundsson (2003). The transfer functions are plot-\nted in non-dimensional form. The scale for the transfer func-\ntions follows from the definitions1u=Tuc1C,1v=Tvc1C,\nwhere1C is the (fractional) slipperiness perturbation. Since\nthe velocity is scaled with the mean deformational velocity\nu\u00afd and1C has no dimensions, u\u00afd is the scale for these trans-\nfer functions.\nGenerally speaking there is a good agreement between the\nvelocity transfer functions of the FS and the SSTREAM solu-\ntions (see Fig. 11). However, there are also a number of sig-\nnificant differences. The SSTREAM long-wavelength limit\nof Tuc is, for example, not the same as that of the FS theory.\nFor n=1 and m=1, and \u03b8=0 we find that the SSTREAM\nsolution gives\nlim\n\u03bb\u2192\u221e Tuc =\n1\n2\nC\u00af,\nwhile the FS solution gives\nlim\n\u03bb\u2192\u221e Tuc =\nC\u00af2\n2(1 + C\u00af) .\nThe effects of basal slipperiness perturbations are therefore\nsomewhat overestimated for long-wavelengths, although for\nhigh slip ratios typical of active ice streams this error is small.\nlog\n10\n(\u03bb) (h\u00af)\n\u03b8 \n \n \n(de\ng.)\n \n \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nFig. 12. Steady-state response of the surface longitudinal (1u) ve-\nlocity component to a basal slipperiness perturbation in the shallow-\nice-stream approximation (Eq. B4). The surface slope is 0.002 and\nthe slip ratio C\u00af=99.\nOver wavelengths less than about 100 ice thicknesses the\nhorizontal forward velocity component (u) reacts weakly\nto basal slipperiness perturbations. In Fig. 11, for exam-\nple, the FS Tuc transfer amplitudes (solid line) are less than\n5% of mean surface speed for this wavelength range. The\nSSTREAM approximation further underestimates this weak\nresponse (see Fig. 11). In comparison to the FS amplitude\nthe SSTREAM Twc amplitudes are, on the other hand, too\nlarge (see Fig. 11). This difference is in most situations of no\nreal concern, however.\nThe most conspicuous aspect of both the FS and the\nSSTREAM Twc transfer amplitudes is how small they are\nboth in absolute terms and in comparison to |Tuc| and |Tvc|.\nIn fact the |Twc| amplitudes are so small that for active ice\nstreams the vertical velocity component can be considered\nto be effectively insensitive to any spatial variations in basal\nslipperiness. As an example, for C\u00af=10 and \u03b1=0.002, which\nare the values used in Fig. 11, the maximum of the FS Twc\namplitude is about 0.025. The corresponding perturbation in\nthe vertical surface velocity component is therefore 0.025 u\u00afd\nwhich for most active ice streams, where the surface veloc-\nity is a few hundred to a few thousand times larger than u\u00afd ,\nis negligible in comparison to the mean horizontal velocity.\nIn contrast, the maximum perturbation in longitudinal veloc-\nity (u) is C\u00af\/2 for C\u00af\u001d1 or about 50 % of the mean surface\nvelocity, and as can be seen from Fig. 11 or direct inspec-\ntion of Eq. (B5). Equally large perturbations in transverse\nvelocity are possible for perturbations in basal slipperiness\nthat are sufficiently misaligned with respect to the mean flow\ndirection.\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/\nG. H. Gudmundsson: Surface response in the shallow-ice-stream approximation 89\nThe transfer amplitude Tuc describing the response of the\nhorizontal forward velocity component (u) to a basal slipper-\niness perturbation is shown as a function of wavelength (\u03bb)\nand orientation (\u03b8 ) in Fig. 12. This Figure should be com-\npared to Fig. 7a giving the u response to a bed topography\nperturbation for the same set of parameters. A noticeable\ndifference between Tub and Tuc amplitudes is the compara-\ntively weak response of u to perturbation in basal slipperi-\nness that are aligned approximately transversely to the mean\nflow (\u03b8<40 degrees) for wavelengths less than about 100\nice thicknesses. However, for a given wavelength, the mag-\nnitude of the perturbation in u caused by a perturbation in\nbasal slipperiness increases sharply with \u03b8 (see Fig. 12). For\na sinusoidal slipperiness perturbation closely aligned with\nthe mean flow direction (\u03b8>70 degrees) the resulting per-\nturbation in forward velocity can become a sizable fraction\nof the total perturbation in slipperiness (C\u00af1C). For exam-\nple, Fig. 12 shows that a sinusoidal basal slipperiness pertur-\nbation with wavelength \u03bb=100 has almost negligible effect\non u if it is aligned transversely to the mean flow direction\n(\u03b8=0), while the perturbation in u is almost equal to the total\nperturbation in slipperiness for \u03b8=90 degrees.\nIn Appendix B the SSTREAM version of the Tuc transfer\nfunction is derived. From Eq. (B4) we find that for pertur-\nbations in basal slipperiness that vary across the flow, i.e.\n\u03b8=pi\/2 and k=0, the transfer function is\nTuc = 2C\u00af2 +ml2C\u00af , (41)\nfor any t . Interestingly, as Eq. (41) shows, the response of\nthe velocity to temporal changes in basal slipperiness per-\nturbations aligned with the mean flow direction is instanta-\nneous. Note furthermore that since Tuc=1u\/1C by defini-\ntion, Tuc=C\u00af corresponds to a situation where the perturba-\ntion in surface velocity is equal, in non-dimensional units, to\nthe (total) perturbation in basal slipperiness. This can be con-\nsidered to represent a full transmission of basal slipperiness\nto the surface velocity field. As Eq. (41) shows, longitudi-\nnal basal slipperiness perturbations (\u03b8 = pi\/2) have, in this\nsense, full effect on the forward surface velocity component\n(u) in the limit \u03bb\u2192\u221e. Note also that for k=0 the limit of\nTuc when \u03bb\u2192\u221e is independent of the sliding law exponent\nm.\nFor \u03b8=0, i.e. where basal slipperiness varies in direction\nparallel to the flow direction but not across the flow, the situ-\nation is very different from that for \u03b8=pi\/2. From B4 given\nin Appendix B we find that in dimensionless units\nTuc = C\u00af1 +m(1 + 2k2C\u00af + ikm cot\u03b1), (42)\nfor l=0. In particular\nlim\nk\u21920 Tuc =\nC\u00af\n1 +m, (43)\nshowing that the long wavelength limit for \u03b8=0 is always\nsmaller than that for \u03b8=pi\/2 and, furthermore, goes to zero\nwith increasing m.\nRaymond (1996) calculated the effects of longitudinal per-\nturbations in slipperiness on surface velocity on ice streams\n(\u03b8=pi\/2). In the dimensionless notation used here his result\n(Eq. 25a in Raymond, 1996) is\nTuc(k = 0, l) = 2C\u00af2 + C\u00afl tanh l . (44)\nFrom Gudmundsson (2003) one finds after some calculations\nthat the FS expression is\nTuc(k = 0, l) = 2C\u00af2 cosh l + C\u00afl sinh l . (45)\nRaymond (1996) considered the case C\u00af\u001d1 and consequently\nthe form of the basal boundary conditions used by him is\nslightly different from the one used in Gudmundsson (2003).\nThis explains the difference between Eqs. (44) and (45).\nIn contrast to Eqs. (44) and (45), Eq. (41) is not limited\nto linear sliding law but valid for any positive value of m.\nWhere Eqs. (41), (44), and (45) can be compared, i.e. for\nm=1 the difference between these three expressions is in\nmost cases small. In particular, all expressions give the same\nlimits for l \u2192 0, l\u2192+\u221e for C\u00af fixed, and C\u00af\u21920 for l fixed.\nFor C\u00af\u2192+\u221e the limits are not identical but for l\u001c1 the dif-\nference is small.\n3.4 Flow over Gaussian peak: the ISMIP-HOM Experi-\nment F\nAs an illustration of differences between the full-system\nand the shallow-ice-stream solutions Fig. 13a and b show\nan example of the surface response to a Gaussian-shaped\nbedrock protuberance calculated using both the FS and the\nSSTREAM transfer functions. The parameters of the exam-\nple are motivated by the definition of the Benchmark Ex-\nperiment F for higher-order ice sheet models of the ongo-\ning model intercomparision project ISMIP-HOM (see http:\n\/\/homepages.ulb.ac.be\/\u223cfpattyn\/ismip\/). Of the mean sur-\nface velocity, half is due to internal ice deformation and the\nother half to basal sliding (C\u00af=1). The flow is down an uni-\nformly inclined plane with a mean slope of 3 degrees. The\nbedrock perturbation is a Gaussian shaped peak situated at\n(x, y)=(0, 0). The peak has a width of 10 h\u00af and amplitude\nof 0.1 h\u00af. Periodic boundary conditions are used with a peri-\nodicity of 400 h\u00af in both x and y directions.\nIf either the slip ratio is not large compared to unity, or\nthe horizontal scale of interest is not large compared to mean\nice thickness, significant deviations between the SSTREAM\nand the FS solutions can be expected. In the experiment the\nslip ratio does not fulfil the condition C\u00af\u001d1 and it comes as\nno surprise that there are some differences between the upper\n(SSTREAM solution) and the lower (FS solution) halves of\nFig. 13a and b.

Surface topography response to a flow over a Gaussian-\nshaped bedrock disturbance as given by a FS (lower half of figure)\nand a SSTREAM solution (upper half of figure). The mean flow\ndirection is from left to right. Surface slope is 3 degrees and mean\nbasal velocity equal to mean deformational velocity (C\u00af=1). The\nspatial unit is one mean ice thickness (h\u00af). The Gaussian-shaped\nbedrock disturbance has a width of 10 h\u00af and it\u2019s amplitude is 0.1 h\u00af.\nThe problem definition is symmetrical about the x axis (y=0) and\nany deviations in the figure from this symmetry are due to differ-\nences in the FS and the SSTREAM solutions.\nSSTREAM solutions seems surprisingly good. There are, for\nexample, only fairly small differences seen in the perturbed\nsurface topography (Fig. 13a). The amplitude of the FS sur-\nface topography perturbation (lower half of Fig. 13a) is a bit\nlarger than that of the SSTREAM one (upper half of Fig. 13a)\nbut otherwise the surface shapes are in qualitatively terms the\nsame.\nThe FS velocity perturbations are generally larger than the\nthose of the SSTREAM approximation (see Fig. 13b). This is\npartly due to the simple fact that the mean SSTREAM veloc-\nity is equal to 1 while the mean FS velocity is twice as large.\nOne could argue that the mean slip ratio in the SSTREAM\ntheory should be redefined to give the same mean surface\nvelocity as the FS solution. In the experiment this would im-\nply using C\u00af=2 when calculating the SSTREAM solutions.\nWhen this is done, the differences between the upper and the\nlower halves in Fig. 13b become considerably smaller and\nthe overall magnitude more similar. Irrespectively of which\nvalue of C\u00af is used, the FS velocity solution has a more de-\ntailed short-scale structure. This aspect of the solution can be\nunderstood by considering the corresponding transfer func-\ntions directly. Comparison of Fig. 7a with b, and Fig. 8a\nwith b (despite the parameters used in these figures being\ndifferent from Experiment F) also illustrates the fact that the\nFS velocity transfer amplitudes are, for short to intermediate\nwavelengths, generally larger than those of the SSTREAM\ntheory.\n0.01\n0.02\n0.020.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.\n050\n.06\nx (h)\ny \n(h)\n\u221230 \u221220 \u221210 0 10 20 30\n\u221230\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\n10\n20\n30\nFig. 13b. Response in surface velocity to a Gaussian-shaped\nbedrock perturbation. All parameters are equal to those in Fig. 13a.\nThe contour lines give horizontal speed and the vectors the hori-\nzontal velocities. The velocity unit is mean-deformational velocity\n(u\u00afd ). The slip ratio is equal to one, and the mean surface velocity is\n2u\u00afd . The upper half of the figure is the SSTREAM solution and the\nlower half the corresponding FS solution.\nIf the width of the Gaussian peak is decreased from 10 h\u00af\nto, 1h\u00af and the slip ratio increased to 100 the differences in the\ncalculated FS and the SSTREAM surface response become\nmore pronounced. The amplitude of the SSTREAM topogra-\nphy perturbation is then much larger than that of the FS solu-\ntion, and in fact quite similar to the shape of the bedrock per-\nturbation itself. This aspect of the SSTREAM solution was\ndiscussed above and is caused by the fact that the SSTREAM\nTsb amplitude is close to unity for small wavelengths (see\nalso Fig. 6a and b).\n4 Summary and conclusions\nAs expected the comparison between the analytical FS and\nSSTREAM solutions shows that the SSTREAM approxima-\ntion is highly accurate for long wavelengths (\u03bb\/h\u00af\u001d1) and\nhigh slip ratios (C\u00af\u001d1). The SSTREAM approximation is\nin these circumstances a much better approximation to the\nFS solutions than the SSHEET approximation. However,\nsomewhat disappointingly, when these conditions are not ful-\nfilled the SSTREAM approximation is not just inaccurate but\ngives rise to some physically unrealistic results. In particu-\nlar, the ratio between surface and bed topography is overes-\ntimated. Whereas the correct ratio is close to zero for \u03bb\u001ch\u00af\nthe SSTREAM gives a ratio close to unity. The SSHEET\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/\nG. H. Gudmundsson: Surface response in the shallow-ice-stream approximation 91\ntheory, which also is inaccurate for \u03bb\u001ch\u00af, fails in this respect\nin a more physically realistic manner by underestimating the\nratio and giving the correct limit of zero as \u03bb\u21920. A related\nsomewhat less than satisfying aspect of the |Tsb| SSTREAM\ntransfer amplitudes is the absence of the local maxima in the\nTsb amplitudes as function of wavelengths seen in the FS so-\nlution.\nThe physically wrong limit of the SSTREAM Tsb ampli-\ntude for \u03bb\u21920 is of some concern. It has, among other things,\nimplications for surface-to-bed inversion. Because this Tsb\ntransfer amplitude limit is equal to unity, small scale surface\nundulations (\u03bb<h\u00af) do not get amplified through a direct in-\nversion and the effects of surface data errors might be under-\nestimated. There is also some danger of the spatial resolving\npower of an SSTREAM surface-to-bed inversion to be over-\nestimated. Further research into these issues is needed before\nfirm quantitative statements can be made.\nThe only previous work dealing with the effects of small-\namplitude perturbations in boundary data on solutions of\nthe SSTREAM theory is the numerical study of Hindmarsh\n(2004). He calculates Tsb transfer amplitudes and both the\ntr and the tp timescales for linear and non-linear medium.\nThe L1L1 approximation used by Hindmarsh (2004) is an\nimproved version of the SSTREAM theory discussed here\nwhich includes the contribution of internal ice deformation\nto the velocity. For high slip ratios the L1L1 approxima-\ntion is effectively equal to the SSTREAM approximation.\nFig. 5 in Hindmarsh (2004) calculated for n=3 shows the\nsame general features of transfer the amplitude Tsb and the\ntimes scales tp and tr for non-linear rheology as found in the\nanalytical solutions given here valid for n=1 and m>0. In\nparticular the |Tsb|\u21921 limit for \u03bb\u21920 is also found by Hind-\nmarsh (2004) for non-linear medium (Fig. 5c). The relative\ninsensitivity of the tr time scale to wavelengths for high slip\nratios, and the chance in phase speed from u\u00afb to (m+1)u\u00afb\nwith increasing wavelength is also seen (Fig. 5a and b in\nHindmarsh, 2004).\nThe SSTREAM solutions are much better approximations\nto the FS solutions than the SSHEET solutions whenever\nC\u00af\u001d1 and \u03bb\/h\u00af\u001d1. For slip ratios typical of active ice\nstreams the SSHEET solution underestimates the relaxation\ntime scale by several order of magnitude. The SSTREAM\nsolution for tr is, on the other hand, almost equal to the cor-\nresponding FS solution down to wavelengths of about 10h\u00af.\nThe SSTREAM solution gives a finite number for tr in the\nlimit \u03bb\u21920 (in dimensional units the limit is 4c\u03b7 tan\u03b1\/u)\nwhereas the same limit for SSHEET theory is zero. It follows\nthat once short wavelengths are present in an SSTREAM\nmodel they do not automatically decay away as they do in\nan SSHEET model.\nComparing the analytical solutions of the SSTREAM and\nthe SSHEET approximations with the FS solutions presented\nhere and in Gudmundsson (2003) provides a quick and an\neasy way of assessing the applicability of these two com-\nmonly used approximations to a particular situation. Results\npresented by Raymond and Gudmundsson (2005) on small-\namplitude response for non-linear medium in the FS theory,\nand by Hindmarsh (2004) on numerical approximations to\nthe Stokes equation for both linear and non-linear medium,\nsuggest that this approach remains useful even when the rhe-\nology of the medium is non-linear. In particular, in cases\nwhere the analytical solutions reveal significant differences\nbetween the SSTREAM or the SSHEET approximations as\ncompared to the FS solutions, it is improbable that inclusion\nof non-linear rheology will reduce these differences.\nAppendix A\nShallow-ice-stream scalings\nWe consider the case of an ice stream with horizontal length\nscale [x] and vertical length scale [z] where the shallow-ice\napproximation [z]\/[x]=\u03b4\u001c1 holds, and write\n(x, y, z) = [x](x\u2217, y\u2217, \u03b4z\u2217).\nwhere the asterisks denote scaled dimensionless variables.\nFor the mass conservation equation (vi,i=0) to be invariant\nwe scale the velocity as\n(u, v,w) = [u](u\u2217, v\u2217, \u03b4w).\nIf we furthermore require the kinematic boundary condition\nat the surface\n\u2202t s + u \u2202xs + v \u2202ys \u2212 w = a,\nwhere s is the surface to be invariant under the scalings we\nmust have\na = \u03b4[u]a\u2217,\nwhere a is the accumulation rate. Thus the scale for a is\n[a]=\u03b4[u]=[w], which seems reasonable as we can expect\nthe vertical velocity to scale with accumulation rate for small\nsurface slopes. We also find using the same invariant require-\nment of the kinematic boundary condition of the surface that\nthe time must be scaled as\nt = [x][u]\u22121t\u2217.\nAs a scale for the stress we use\n[\u03c3 ] = A\u22121\/n([a]\/[z])1\/n,\nwhich is motivated by the expectation \u000f\u02d9xx \u223c a\/H and Glen\u2019s\nflow law\n\u03c4ij = A\u22121\/n\u000f\u02d9(1\u2212n)\/n \u000f\u02d9ij ,\nwhere \u000f\u02d9 is the effective strain rate defined through \u000f\u02d9 :\n=(\u000f\u02d9ij \u000f\u02d9ij\/2)1\/2 and \u03c4ij are the deviatoric stress components.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/77\/2008\/ The Cryosphere, 2, 77\u201393, 2008\n92 G. H. Gudmundsson: Surface response in the shallow-ice-stream approximation\nWe are considering a situation where the vertical shear com-\nponents are small compared to all other stress components.\nA set of scalings which reflects this situation is\n(\u03c3xx, \u03c3yy, \u03c3zz, \u03c3xy, \u03c3xz, \u03c3yz)\n= [\u03c3 ](\u03c3 \u2217xx, \u03c3 \u2217yy, \u03c3 \u2217zz, \u03c3 \u2217xy, \u03b4\u03c3 \u2217xz, \u03b4\u03c3 \u2217yz). (A1)\nSame scale is used for the pressure, that is p=[\u03c3 ]p\u2217,\nThe analysis is done in a coordinate system which is tilted\nforward in x direction by the angle \u03b1.

We obtain a consistent set of equa-\ntions for \u03b1=O(\u03b4). The slope \u03b1 is then no longer just an arbi-\ntrary tilt angel and \u03c4\u00af can be interpreted as a scale for the basal\nshear stress. From the scalings (A1) we then have [\u03c4\u00af ]=\u03b4[\u03c3 ],\nand it follows that the two non-zero terms on the right hand\nside of the system of Eqs. (A2) to (A4) are of order unity.\nNote that only terms of order \u03b42 are being dropped from the\nmomentum equations.\nWe write the basal sliding law on the form\nub = c(x, y)|Tb|m\u22121Tb, (A5)\nwhere Tb is the basal stress vector given by Tb=\u03c3 n\u02c6\u2212(n\u02c6T \u00b7\n\u03c3 n\u02c6)n\u02c6, with n\u02c6 being a unit normal vector to the bed pointing\ninto the ice, and ub is the basal sliding velocity given by ub =\nv\u2212 (n\u02c6T \u00b7 v)n\u02c6. The function c(x, y) is referred to as the basal\nslipperiness. We find that components of the scaled basal\nstress vector (T\u2217b) are given by\nT \u2217bx = \u03b4\u2202\u2217xb\u2217(\u03c3 \u2217zz\u2212\u03c3 \u2217xx)\u2212\u03b4\u2202\u2217yb\u2217\u03c3 \u2217xy+\u03b4\u03c3 \u2217xz+O(\u03b43), (A6)\nT \u2217by = \u03b4\u2202\u2217yb\u2217(\u03c3 \u2217zz\u2212\u03c3 \u2217yy)\u2212\u03b4\u2202\u2217xb\u2217\u03c3 \u2217xy+\u03b4\u03c3 \u2217yz+O(\u03b43), (A7)\nT \u2217bz = \u03b42((\u03c3 \u2217zz\u2212\u03c3 \u2217xx)(\u2202\u2217xb\u2217)2+(\u03c3 \u2217zz\u2212\u03c3 \u2217yy)(\u2202\u2217yb\u2217)2 (A8)\n\u22122\u03c3 \u2217xy\u2202\u2217xb\u2217 \u2202\u2217yb\u2217+\u03c3 \u2217xz\u2202\u2217xb\u2217+\u03c3 \u2217yz\u2202\u2217yb\u2217)+O(\u03b44).\nThus T \u2217bx and T \u2217by are O(\u03b4) while u\u2217b and v\u2217b are O(1), hence\nc[\u03c3 ]m[u]\u22121 = O(\u03b4\u2212m). (A9)\nNote that since [\u03c4\u00af ] = \u03b4[\u03c3 ], we can also write Eq. (A9)\nas c[\u03c4\u00af ]m[u]\u22121\u03b4\u2212m = O(\u03b4\u2212m) from which it follows that\nc[\u03c4\u00af ]m[u]\u22121 = O(1), as expected.\nUsing \u000f\u02d9xz=A\u03c4n\u22121\u03c3xz one finds that \u2202zu=O(\u03b42), or\nsmaller. Thus, to second order the horizontal velocity com-\nponents u and v are independent of z. Differentiating the in-\ncompressibility equation vi,i = 0 with respect to z it then fol-\nlows that \u000f\u02d9zz is independent of depth as well and thatw varies\nlinearly with depth. A further consequence is that since the\nsliding velocity is of order unity and the deformational ve-\nlocity ud=O(\u03b42) the slip ratio u\u00afb\/u\u00afd=O(\u03b4\u22122). Note that in\nboth the field equations and all boundary conditions all first\norder terms are identically equal to zero. The theory is con-\nsequently correct to second order in \u03b4.\nOnly collecting zeroth-order terms followed by vertical in-\ntegration over depth and some simple manipulation leads to\nthe following two coupled differential equations for the hor-\nizontal velocity components u and v\n\u2202x(4h\u03b7\u2202xu+2h\u03b7\u2202yv)+\u2202y(h\u03b7(\u2202xv+\u2202yu))\u2212(u\/c)1\/m\n=\u03c1gh\u2202xs cos\u03b1\u2212\u03c1gh sin\u03b1, (A10)\n\u2202y(4h\u03b7\u2202yv+2h\u03b7\u2202xu)+\u2202x(h\u03b7(\u2202yu+\u2202xv))\u2212(v\/c)1\/m\n=\u03c1gh\u2202yS cos\u03b1. (A11)\nNote that we have now gone back to the dimensional vari-\nables. The quantity \u03b7 is the effective viscosity defined\nthrough \u03c4ij=2\u03b7\u000f\u02d9ij . For Glen\u2019s flow law the effective strain\nrate is given by\n\u000f\u02d9 =\n\u221a\n(\u2202xu)2 + (\u2202yv)2 + (\u2202yu+ \u2202xv)2\/4 + \u2202xu \u2202yv,\nan expression that is correct to second order.\nAppendix B\nResponse of flow to basal slipperiness perturbations\nWe consider the response to small perturbation in basal slip-\nperiness. Writing h=h\u00af + 1s, s=s\u00af+1s, b=b\u00af, u=u\u00af+1u,\nv=1v, w=1w, and c=c\u00af(1+1c) where 1c is the fractional\nslipperiness, and inserting into (1) and (2) gives again the\nzeroth-order solution (3).
