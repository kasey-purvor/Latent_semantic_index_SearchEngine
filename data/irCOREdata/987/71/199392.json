Here we \nconsider the interventions that are currently in place and critically discuss the \nmethods that are being used to evaluate them as reported in the published \nliterature.  In recent years there has been a move away from highly individual-\noriented interventions towards more participatory approaches that emphasise \ntechniques such as community-led peer education and group discussions.  \nHowever, this move towards more community orientated intervention techniques \nhas not been matched by the development of evaluation methods with which to \ncapture and explain the community and social changes which are often \nnecessary preconditions for health-enhancing behaviour change.  Evaluation \nresearch continues to rely on quantitative methodologies that fail to elucidate the \ncomplex changes that the newer interventions seek to promote within target \ncommunities.  In addition, these methods of evaluation tend to rely on the use of \nhighly individualistic and quantitative biomedical indicators such as HIV\/STD \nrates, or knowledge, attitude, perception and behaviour (KAPB) survey \nquestionnaires. We argue that such approaches are inadequate for the task of \ntracking and measuring important determinants of programme success such as \npsycho-social changes, features of the community-intervention interface and the \ndegree of trust and identification with which members of target communities \nregard particular interventions. Rigorously conducted qualitative process \nevaluations taking account of the above factors could make a key contribution to \nthe development of more successful HIV-prevention interventions. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nWhile the development of an effective vaccine and cure for HIV remain elusive, \ninterventions aimed at HIV-prevention continue to be the best hope for limiting \ntransmission of the virus and the spread of infection.  Approaches to prevention have \nevolved from an early emphasis on information-based HIV-awareness campaigns \nand the aggressive detection and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases \n(operating at the behavioural and biomedical levels of analysis, and focusing on \nindividual levels of awareness and infection) towards more community-based \napproaches involving peer education, and using participatory techniques such as \npeer-led role-plays and group discussions.  \n \nIn this paper we analyse in detail current evaluation strategies for HIV-prevention \ninterventions in developing countries. Our analysis forms the basis for a critique of \nthe evaluation strategies that currently dominate the field of HIV-prevention.  We \n 2 \n \nseek to show that despite the move towards more social and community orientated \napproaches within HIV-prevention interventions, project evaluators have tended to \nfavour methodologies that give precedence to the individual level of analysis, and in \nparticular methodologies that measure individual disease states (such as STD \nresults) and knowledge, attitudes and reported behaviours, also measured as the \nproperties of individuals. \n \nIn focusing on the individual levels of analysis, not only do these evaluations fail to \ncapture the social and community level processes that state-of-the-art HIV \nprevention interventions seek to promote, they also squander a vital opportunity to \nimprove our understanding of factors that promote or hinder sexual behaviour \nchange in concrete social settings.  Better understanding of the processes could lead \nnot only to the development of a more refined battery of indicators of programme \nsuccess  \u2013 but could also contribute to the development of more effective \ninterventions and policies in the field of sexual health promotion.  \n \nWe argue here that the task of developing such indicators requires not only a shift \naway from individual towards the social and community levels of analysis but it also \ninvolves paying greater attention to the task of supplementing existing quantitative \nmeasures of programme success or failure with qualitative contextual material, and \nsupplementing the current preference for outcome measures with greater attention to \nthe development of process measures.  Aggleton, Young, Moody, Kapila and Pye \n(1992) distinguish between \u2018outcome evaluation\u2019 and \u2018process evaluation\u2019. Outcome \nevaluations are usually quantitative in nature, and aim to measure whether and to \nwhat extent the goals associated with a particular health intervention programme \nhave been met. Process evaluations are usually qualitative in nature, and aim to \nexamine how programme outcomes have been achieved. Our belief that greater \nefforts should be devoted to qualitative process evaluation strategies is not shared \nby all researchers, many of whom regard the randomized controlled study as the \ngold standard needed ensure the replicability and repeatability of HIV interventions \n(Choi & Coates, 1994; Oakley, Fullerton & Holland, 1995; Peterman & Aral, 1993).  \nRandomised control trials (RCTs) are appropriate and even essential in many \nsituations and are held in high regard by biomedical researchers who dominate the \nfield of HIV-prevention. In addition, they appeal to many programme funders in a \ncompetitive funding climate, where money is often only available for short-term \nprojects, judged in terms of their potential to quickly produce quantifiable outcomes, \nrather than to promote long-term community development processes. Many social \nscientists would argue that the latter are an essential precondition for ensuring that \npositive health outcomes are sustainable and generalisable beyond the life of the \nparticular project and beyond the particular individual community members exposed \nto the project (Beeker,Guenther-Grey & Raj, 1998; Gillies, Tolley & Wolstenholme, \n1996).  They argue further that we still lack adequate conceptual frameworks and \nindicators for operationalising these community development processes which are \ncritical variables without which we cannot sensibly evaluate the results of RCT trials.  \nThis point is developed further below. \n \nWe argue that while RCTs clearly provide a valuable tool in a range of contexts, they \nare not necessarily relevant or appropriate in all contexts.  In particular we argue that \nRCTs are not necessarily a feasible way of evaluating the often poorly funded, small-\nscale HIV-prevention programmes in developing countries.  The first problem \n 3 \n \nconcerns ethics.  RCTs usually involve withholding, or at least not offering, treatment \nto control groups in order to show that a more pronounced change in the intervention \ngroup can be directly attributed to intervention.  The ethics of withholding, or \npostponing, treatment from control groups in the interests of scientific investigation \nare now being debated.  Furthermore, the literature suggests that the use of placebo \nin HIV interventions will no longer be acceptable (Abdool Karim, 1998; Lurie & Wolfe, \n1997; Moodley, 1998). Some researchers try to deal with this ethical requirement by \nintroducing treatment to the control group later in the intervention.  However this \nissue remains controversial, with Angell (1997) arguing that placebo trials are only \njustifiable where there is no known effective treatment.  \n \nThe second limitation is cost.  Randomised control trials demand high levels of \nexpertise and expense in their planning, design, execution and analysis and as such \ndo not constitute \u2018appropriate technology\u2019 for often poorly funded research \nprogrammes in developing countries. \n \nThirdly, and most relevant to the argument of this paper, randomised control trials \nhave a limited contribution to make to the task of developing understandings of the \ncomplex environments in which interventions directed at sexual behaviour take \nplace.  Randomised control trials assume that we are already able to define the \nfactors that need to be taken into account in explaining the success or failure of \nhealth promotion programmes.  We argue that our understanding of health \npromotion factors shaping sexuality is still in its infancy, and that much more \n\u2018conceptual groundwork\u2019 needs to be done before we can be confident that the \ndiscrete quantitative indicators used in randomised control trials are indeed the best \ngauge of processes shaping sexuality. \n \nWhat then are the community and social level processes which community-based, \nparticipatory HIV-prevention programmes seek to advance in pursuit of the outcomes \nof bringing about health-promoting behaviour change and reduced STD\/HIV levels?  \nUnderstanding of the processes underlying successful sexual behaviour change \ninterventions is still very under-developed. Here we refer to three different areas in \nwhich researchers are currently seeking to answer this question. \n \ni) Psycho-social factors involved in sexual behaviour change \n \nCampbell (1997) and Campbell and Williams (1998) suggest that sexual behaviour is \na complex and multi-determined phenomenon, determined by intra-individual, inter-\nindividual, community, social and economic factors (see MacPhail, 1998).  They \nargue that we currently lack the conceptual tools needed to adequately understand \nor measure the inter-acting effects of these factors, each operating at a different \nlevel, on peoples\u2019 sexuality.  They try to unravel how some of these factors might \noperate through their attempts to understand the factors underlying sexual behaviour \nchange in the context of HIV-prevention in the gold mining community of \nCarletonville.  They argue that HIV-prevention programmes will succeed or fail in \nchanging peoples' sexual behaviour to the extent that they:  \n (a) Increase levels of perceived self-efficacy amongst target groupings.  The \ngreater control people have over the important aspects of their lives, the greater \nlikelihood there is that they will adopt health promoting behaviour (Syme, 1989).  \n 4 \n \nSuccessful interventions will develop the individual\u2019s belief in his\/her potential to \ninfluence his or her life circumstances, including his or her health status.  \n (b) Provide the opportunity for target audience members to renegotiate their \nsexual and social identities at the collective level.  Dube and Wilson (1996) argue \nthat sexual behaviour change is more likely to occur through the influence of peers \nthan through conscious rational choices made by individuals in isolation.  People are \nmore likely to change their behaviour if they perceive that liked and trusted peers are \nchanging theirs.  \n (c) Promote the development of community contexts that enable and support \nthe sexual behaviour changes that HIV-prevention programmes seek to bring about.  \nCampbell and Williams (1999) argue that such changes in self-efficacy and social \nidentity are unlikely to occur unless attempts are made to simultaneously promote \nthe development of 'health-enabling communities'. Thus for example, there is no \npoint in devoting efforts to encouraging condom use amongst impoverished \ncommercial sex workers, in a context where clients refuse to use condoms, and \nwhere there is no consensus amongst women to enforce condom use (Campbell, \n1999). In this context, a 'health-enabling community' would be one where sex \nworkers collectively debated the way in which competition for clients was placing \ntheir lives at risk, and they made a group-based decision to present a united front to \nreluctant clients (see also Tawil, Verster & O\u2019Reilly, 1995). \n \nii) The interface between target community members and the intervention \n \nCampbell and Williams (1998) consider the broader psycho-social and community-\nlevel processes that they believe are most likely to maximise the chances of \nprogramme success. Kreuter  (1997, p. 8) focuses more narrowly on particular \naspects of the programme-target audience interface most likely to enhance the \neffects of such health promotion programmes, arguing that: \n \nHealth promotion interventions and tactics will be effective to the extent that the \ntarget community has organisational entities and systems that are supportive of \nthe enterprise, and that these entities and systems are activated. The activation \nof relevant community entities and systems depends in part on the extent to \nwhich community members are aware of, value and trust the proposed \nintervention. \n \nKreuter argues for the need to develop measurable indicators of notions such as \n'activated organisational entities' and 'community trust' in order to evaluate the extent \nto which health promotional programmes set into motion processes most likely to \nresult in desired outcomes (in this case outcomes such as condom use and lowered \nSTD levels). \n \niii) Multi-sectoral alliances: broader organisational context of the intervention  \n \nIn her study of 'best practices' in health promotion in a range of developed and \ndeveloping countries, Gillies (1998) emphasises the importance of alliances or \npartnership initiatives between local health promotional efforts on the one hand, and \nother health-related initiatives at the local, provincial and national levels on the other. \nThus, for example, grassroots women's health projects should interface with similar \nprojects in the geographical vicinity, and as much as possible with representatives of \nas broad a range of provincial and national health bodies as possible. Such \n 5 \n \nnetworking is most likely to result in sustainable health promotion, through \ncoordinating what might otherwise be piecemeal attempts by different bodies to \ndevelop health-promoting interventions and policies.  Gillies also emphasises the \nimportance of alliances between workers in a range of other sectors that impact on \nhealth (e.g. welfare, housing), as well as across lay and professional boundaries, \nand between public, private and non-governmental organisations. \n \nMethodology \n \nIn reviewing existing accounts of HIV-prevention programme evaluations, a search \nwas conducted on the Current Contents and Medline databases to generate a list of \npublished articles discussing STD and HIV interventions in developing countries with \nthe specific aim of investigating the evaluation of these projects.  In Current Contents \nthe keywords used were: human health intervention; peer education; behaviour \nchange; community outreach; AIDS intervention; HIV intervention; STD intervention; \nsexual behaviour; AIDS prevention and AIDS evaluation.  For Medline the keywords \nwere similar but included STD intervention; AIDS intervention; behaviour change; \nintervention; condom use; evaluation; condom use; evaluation; sexual; education \nprogramme; AIDS; HIV intervention and condom promotion.  In addition, a manual \nbibliographic search was conducted using the literature already generated by the \nelectronic search.  This manual search pointed to the existence of a large body of \nunpublished or \u2018grey\u2019 literature about HIV prevention programmes in developing \ncountries\n1\n.  \n \nOnce the 'grey' literature, and literature regarding similar issues in developed \ncountries had been eliminated, 41 articles remained.  These were accessed and \ncarefully read by the first author, in order to develop an interpretative thematic \nanalysis focusing on the types of interventions described in these papers as well as \nthe methodologies used to evaluate them.  In relation to the characteristics of the \ninterventions, information regarding the country and target group was recorded, as \nwere the various strategies utilised during the period of intervention.  In most cases, \na variety of intervention methods were employed within a single study.  In relation to \nevaluation, the methodology considered the nature of the evaluation tools used \n('method of evaluation'); the time frame in which the intervention\/evaluation took \nplace; whether the study presented quantitative and\/or qualitative evaluation data; \nand the results obtained during the process of evaluation. \n \n \nResults \n \nTable 1 presents the results of the analysis of the 41 relevant articles.  A descriptive \nsummary of these results follows after the table. \n                                                 \n1\n Campbell and Williams (1996) call for the development of a resource centre to house the unpublished \nliterature on HIV prevention in South Africa.

(1998) A randomized, community trial of intensive sexually transmitted disease control for AIDS prevention, Rakai, Uganda. AIDS, 12(10), 1211-1225. \n 14 \n \n1) Country: Within the 41 studies reported on here, 42 countries were used as \nintervention sites.  The largest percentage (57%) were in Africa (n=24).  Of these, \n4 each were from Zaire and Uganda; 3 each from Kenya, Zimbabwe and \nTanzania; and a single intervention each from Nigeria, Rwanda, Ghana, South \nAfrica, Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique.  A further 18% of the interventions \nwere from Thailand and India (4 each), and the remainder from a mix of countries \nincluding Honduras, Singapore (2 interventions), Peru, the Philippines, Indonesia, \nNicaragua, Brazil, Mexico and Nepal. \n \n2) Subjects: The 41 interventions were directed at a total of 51 different groups.  \n32% (16) of the subjects were sex workers and 20% were directed at \ncommunities and 20% at young people (10 in each case).  The interventions for \nyoung people included 8 for school students (only one of which was for primary \nschool children), one for student teachers and one for youth working in factories \nin Thailand.  Four interventions were aimed at the clients of commercial sex \nworkers and 3 at their madams, pimps or brothel owners.  All of these 7 \ninterventions were carried out in conjunction with interventions aimed at sex \nworkers.  In addition, one intervention for sex workers also had a general \ncommunity component.  Groups targeted with a single intervention include non-\ncommercial partners of sex workers, female outpatients and their male partners, \nSTD patients, prisoners, trucking company workers, homosexual men and \npharmacists. \n \n3) Type of intervention: Only seven studies made use of only a single intervention \nmethodology but this may be because they chose not to expand on their \nintervention methodologies.  In one case no details of the intervention were \navailable (Rusaniko et al., 1997).  The majority of studies used a number of \ndifferent intervention methods (Mean=3.7 per study), with a total of 152 \nintervention methods being used across the 41 studies.  17% of the intervention \nmethods related to health education within groups (20) or directed at individuals \n(5).  Other commonly used interventions included condom promotion and\/or \ndistribution (11%), peer education (7%), provision of or improvement of STD care \n(7%), educational videos\/films (7%), distribution of pamphlets (5%), condom \ndemonstrations (5%), lectures (5%), role plays (5%), educational posters (4%) \nand use of mass media (3%).  A few innovative interventions were recorded \nacross the different studies, but were especially concentrated in two school-\nbased interventions (Klepp et al., 1994; Kuhn, Steinberg & Mathews, 1994).  \nThese include the use of cartoons (n=2), poster creation (n=2), drama (n=2), \ncollective action (n=2) and skills development (n=1). \n \n4) Method of evaluation: Within the 41 studies mentioned here, 42 evaluations were \nconducted with one study (Ngugi, Wilson, Sebstad, Plummer & Moses, 1996) \nevaluating projects in both Zimbabwe and Kenya.  A total of 90 evaluation \nmethods were used within the studies (Mean=2.2).  The most common form of \nevaluation (38%) relied on KAPB questionnaires or surveys (n=34).  The next \nmost commonly used evaluation method relied on STD test results from the study \npopulations (11%), and a further 4% used routinely collected data.  Collection of \nHIV test results, monitoring of unprotected sex acts through some form of diary \nand evaluation of acceptability of the intervention were frequently utilized and \nmade up 10%, 7% and 7% of the evaluation strategies, respectively.  Qualitative \n 15 \n \nevaluation methods were less common but a small number of studies (7%) used \nin-depth interviews and focus groups (n=4 and n=2 respectively).  One study \nused rapid formative assessment and another used participant observation \n \n5) Study design: The evaluations (n=42) were almost completely divided between \nthose that used control groups (43%) and those that did not (53%).  Post-testing \nwas used in 83% of the studies. \n \n6) Time of post-testing: HIV interventions frequently take time to implement and \nchanges in behaviour are therefore monitored over time.  34 studies made use of \na baseline and post-testing design with the mean time lapse between the two \nbeing 14 months.  The shortest time lapse between baseline and post-testing was \n2 weeks while the longest was 7 years.  Shorter time lapses between baseline \nand post-testing tend to be in interventions directed towards school children due \nto the limited time available during school hours. \n \n7) Type of analysis: Of the 42 evaluations 81% were entirely quantitative (n=34).  \nResearchers in only two of the evaluations concentrated on qualitative evaluation \nalone while a further 5 made use of a combination of both qualitative and \nquantitative.  In one study the details of the evaluation are unknown. \n \nDiscussion \n \nTypes of interventions \nThe interventions in the current review date from between 1991 and 1998.  The \nsubjects of the interventions from developing countries ranged across a number of \ntarget groups.  In some cases entire adult communities were targeted, but in most \ncases commercial sex workers formed the target for intervention.  A smaller number \nof interventions of shorter duration were targeted at school-going children at both \nprimary and high school level. \n \nThe interventions investigated rarely focused on a single intervention strategy but \nincorporated a number of different methods which, in most cases, were utilised \nsimultaneously.  In a few cases, however, the different intervention methods formed \nthe basis of comparison between multiple intervention groups (see Nyamuryekung\u2019e \net al., 1997; Wilson, Mparadzi & Lavelle, 1992). \n \nInterventions ranged from the purely biomedical to those with a mix of biomedical \nand community participatory approaches.  The extent of community participation in \ninterventions varied, but on the whole the studies investigated involved some form of \nparticipation.  Participatory approaches varied widely and a large range are \nrepresented in the highlighted studies. \n \nA number of the studies under review improve or supply STD treatment by doctors, \nnurses or other biomedically trained personnel as part of their intervention strategy.  \nIn itself, the provision of STD care does not encourage community participation and \na number of researchers attempt to remedy this by including improved STD care in \npackages which embrace other more participatory approaches.  This encourages the \ntrend towards encouraging greater participation of grassroots community members in \nthe implementation of sexual health promotion programmes.  Thus, in the Cross \n 16 \n \nRiver State of Nigeria and in the truck stops of Tanzania the provision of STD care is \ncombined with peer education and the distribution of condoms (Nyamuryekung\u2019e et \nal., 1997; Williams, Lamson, Weir & Lamptey, 1992), while sex workers in Shurugwi, \nZimbabwe are encouraged to take part in a committee to decide on issues \nconcerning HIV\/STD transmission to clients (Chipfakacha, 1993).  The use of \nparticipatory methods in combination with STD treatment is not, however, common to \nall interventions and there are those which use other non-participatory methods to \nenhance the provision of STD care.  In these instances most intervention teams \nincorporate health education and condom promotion with STD clinic staff training, \nprovision of a regular supply of drugs and supervisory visits to clinics (Grosskurth et \nal., 1995; Jackson et al., 1997; Laga et al., 1994; Moses, Plummer, Ngugi, \nNagelkerke, Anzala & Ndinya-Achola, 1991).  STD care as a single intervention \nmethod was only reported in two studies.  One involved the training of Nepalese \npharmacists in syndromic management (Tuldhar, Mills, Acharya, Pradhan, Pollock & \nDallabetta, 1998) and the other initiated the periodic presumptive treatment of a \nUgandan community (Wawer at al., 1998).  The use of participatory methods was, \nhowever, more common among other interventions. \n \nA perusal of the remaining studies reveals the extent to which HIV and STD \ninterventions have moved towards participatory methods.  The most commonly used \nmethods include group education and discussion, peer education and the use of role \nplays.  While traditional didactic intervention methods remain common, it is vital to \nrecognise that in many cases videos, pamphlets, STD care and lectures are being \nused in conjunction with active community participation and as vehicles for peer \neducation.  Interventions aimed at school children often attempt to completely \nsubmerge their subjects in discussion and thought about HIV by adopting an HIV \ntheme for all school activities during a certain period of time (Kuhn et al., 1994).  A \nmethodology such as this will usually include both didactic and participatory \nmethods. \n \nWhile traditional intervention methods are well known to intervention teams, \nparticipatory methods are still in their infancy and therefore require innovative \nthought and formulation.  For this reason no single participatory intervention method \nwas found in all projects.  Rather, a diverse range of methods are employed across \nthe studies highlighted here.  Among students, prisoners and sex workers attempts \nhave been made to address HIV issues through drama, the creation and exhibition of \neducational posters, games and dances (Aplasca, et al., 1995; Asthana & \nOostvogels, 1996; Klepp et al., 1994; Kuhn et al., 1994; Schopper, Doussentousse, \nAyiga, Ezatirale, Idro & Homsy, 1995; Vaz, Gloyd & Trindade, 1996; Visrutaratna, \nLindan, Sirhorachai & Mandel, 1995; Williams et al., 1992).  Expansion of the \naudiences reached is also encouraged through the involvement of sex worker clients, \nbrothel owners, communities and students\u2019 parents through meetings, committees \nand public events (Chipfakacha, 1993; Klepp et al., 1994; Kuhn et al., 1994; \nSchoepf, 1993; Schopper et al., 1995).  Participation of this sort encourages \nsustainable and self-supporting change at the community level rather than individual \nchange in a hostile environment. \n \nIn recent work there has been recognition of the importance of the community, social \nand economic determinants of HIV.  Asthana and Oostvogels (1996) highlight the \nrole of community in discussing their attempts to introduce community participation \n 17 \n \namong the economically marginalised and stigmatised sex workers of Madras, India.  \nTheir experience indicates the difficulties, but also the rewards, inherent in \ninterventions aiming to increase community participation where historically there has \nbeen no sense of \u2018community\u2019.  The eventual demise of the project, despite good \ncondom distribution, highlights the importance of political, economic and community \nlevel co-operation.  \n \nWithin Zaire similar work has been conducted at the community level by making use \nof experiential training (Schoepf, 1993).  This method \u2018\u2026concentrates on self-\nempowerment, [but] it can also be used to initiate and sustain other, broader types of \nsocially transformative change\u2019 (Schoepf, 1993, p. 1404).  Activities initiated through \nrole plays, picture \u2018codes\u2019 and ethnographic exercises encourage women to share \ntheir experiences and to develop solutions to problems communally.  This method \nwas particularly effective in allowing commercial sex workers to gain personal \nexperience of condom use.  The sex workers\u2019 knowledge and competence with \ncondoms led to an increase in their previously low social standing.  In advocating \nparticipatory methods as above, Schoepf (1993) stresses the fact that these activities \ncannot take place among individuals without taking into account society\u2019s discourses, \nsuch as racism, moralism, denial and male chauvinism in Zaire, which impact on, \nand contribute to the spread of HIV. \n \nIn short, the majority of interventions used have sought in one way or another to \nencourage participation by target audience members.  Participatory methods take \nvarious forms ranging from those in which target audience members simply \nparticipate in limited programme activities (as in Asamoah-Adu, Weir, Pappoe, \nKanlisi, Nequaye & Lamptey, 1994) to more radical forms of participation, where \ntarget audience members are actively involved in programme planning or \nimplementation and drive the programme forward in the way best suited to their \ncommunity (as in Schoepf, 1993).  Given the increasing confidence that programme \ndesigners and funders are giving to the process of participation, there is an urgent \nneed for better understanding of what constitutes health-enhancing participation.  \nNot only would this allow for improved intervention implementation, but would \nencourage more rigorous participatory evaluation. \n \nMethods of Evaluation \nAs illustrated above, the progress that has been made in the design of community-\nbased interventions, and in particular the trend towards greater participation by and \nrepresentation of grassroots target audience members in programme planning and \nimplementation, has not been matched in the development of appropriate \ncommunity-level indicators. Such indicators are needed for evaluating the psycho-\nsocial and environmental processes which community-level HIV prevention \nprogrammes seek to encourage so as to promote health-enabling environments, i.e. \nenvironments which reduce the likelihood of people engaging in unsafe sexual \nbehaviour. \n 18 \n \nHere we seek to highlight three crucial limitations of existing evaluation methods: \n \n1) Over-reliance on quantitative methodologies \nExisting evaluation strategies give too much importance to quantitative analysis: \nOf the 42 different interventions conducted in the studies under review, \nquantitative evaluations were conducted in 34 cases.  There were 5 attempts to \nconduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluation within the same study and \nonly 2 studies made use of qualitative methods as their main evaluation \nmeasurement. \n \nA strong reliance on KAPB questionnaires is present in most interventions with \nthe evaluation being statistically measured by administering questionnaires \nbefore and after the intervention.  From the results of these surveys researchers \nare able to calculate the percentage increase in condom use (Ford, Wirawan, \nFajans, Meliawan, MacDonald & Thorpe, 1996; Fox, Bailey, Clarke-Martinez, \nCoello, Ordonez & Barahona, 1993; Konde-Lule, Tumwesigye & Lubanga, 1997; \nNgugi et al., 1996; Visrutaratna et al., 1995; Williams et al., 1992); increase in \nknowledge about HIV transmission; behaviour change (Aplasca et al., 1995; \nArchibald, Chan, Wong, Goh & Goh, 1994; Asmoah-Adu, et al., 1994; Jackson et \nal., 1997; Klepp et al., 1994; Munodawafa, Marty & Gwede, 1995; Schopper et \nal., 1995; Vaz et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1992; Wynendaele, Bomba, Manga, \nBhart & Fransen, 1995;); and changes in perceptions of personal risk (Pauw, \nFerrie, Villegas, Mart\u00ednez, Gorter & Egger, 1996).  Quantitative methodology is \nalso used through pre-and post-intervention STD tests with project success being \nmeasured by significant declines in STD prevalence or incidence (Allen et al., \n1992; Archibald et al., 1994; Bhave et al., 1995; Chipfakacha, 1993; Jackson et \nal., 1997; Laga et al., 1994; Nymauryekung\u2019e et al., 1997).  Evaluation through \nthe comparison of pre- and post-intervention HIV incidence or prevalence is also \nemployed (Allen et al., 1992; Grosskurth et al., 1995; Nymauryekung\u2019e et al., \n1997).  Modeling and estimations allow researchers to estimate the number of \npotential HIV infections interventions have prevented (Moses et al., 1991; Ngugi \net al., 1996).  While quantitative measures are important in providing \u2018proof\u2019 that \nan intervention has had the desired impact, they furnish limited or no \nunderstanding of dynamics operating within the project.  In addition, the use of \nquantitative evaluation methods reinforce our third limitation, still to be discussed, \nby focusing evaluation on the individual rather than developing tools to evaluate \nthe changes at the community or social level. \n \nNotwithstanding this emphasis on quantitative methods in the of HIV intervention \nprogrammes, a small number of qualitative evaluation strategies appear in the \nliterature.  Unlike more quantitative methods there is great variety in their \nformulation and execution. Those studies that do report qualitative findings are \nhampered by their failure to provide a systematic account of the methods by \nwhich their data were collected and analysed. Too often, the reporting of \nqualitative data takes the form of anecdotal observations, or informal thumbnail \nsketches of authors' personal impressions of psycho-social or community level \nfactors which they believe had an impact on the intervention. There is a \nconsiderable social scientific literature on qualitative research methodology, and \nthis needs to be drawn on more rigorously by intervention evaluators, thereby \nencouraging the scientific community to take their findings seriously. \n 19 \n \n \nAs Asthana and Oostvogels (1996) comment, there is still a widely held view \nwithin the scientific community that qualitative evaluations lack the rigor of their \nquantitative counterparts.  Our views on this criticism of qualitative researchers \ndepend on what criteria one is using for 'rigor'.  If one interprets rigor as the use \nof systematic methods of data collection and analysis, we would agree with this \ncriticism but insist that qualitative research can, and should be done rigorously.  \nHowever, the biomedical community who dominate the field of HIV-prevention, \noften imply that the only kind of research that is rigorous is research using \nquantifiable indicators, analysed by statistical, preferably parametric, methods.  It \nis our belief that it is premature and possibly inappropriate to use this criterion of \n'scientific rigor' as the gold standard for judging evaluation strategies in the field \nof HIV prevention.  A great deal more theoretical and empirical research remains \nto be done before our understanding of the determinants of sexual behaviour and \nsexual behaviour change can be operationalised in terms of a few quantitatively \nmeasurable, discrete survey variables of the type which would be amenable to \n\u2018rigorous\u2019 analysis under this definition (MacPhail, 1998). \n \nAs we argue above, a great deal more qualitative research remains to be done in \nthe interests of developing quantifiable indicators of intervention success which \nmove beyond the theoretically limited variables that are measured in KAPB \nsurveys, for example. We believe such criteria of rigor might also be inappropriate \nbecause sexuality and sexual behaviour change are such complex, multi-level \n(individual, group, community, social) and context-dependent phenomena that it \nseems unlikely that they will ever be adequately accounted for in discrete, \ngeneralisable variables of the kind traditionally privileged by biomedical scientists. \n \nReturning to the literature review, qualitative evaluation is rarely used alone but \nrather as a means of enhancing and interpreting information collected through \nKAPB questionnaires.  The five studies using this approach generated richer \nevaluative information than those that focused on quantitative methods alone.  \nAmong young adults in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil KAPB questionnaires established that \nthere was almost no change in high risk behaviour post-intervention.  Workshops \nheld after the intervention ascertained that societal uncertainties such as \nunemployment, housing problems and harsh economic environments were far \nmore pressing concerns for this group than STDs and HIV.  In addition, the group \nindicated their inability to afford condoms and the inaccessibility of condom \nsupplies (Antunes et al., 1997).  Similar information was forthcoming from focus \ngroups held in Ugandan Muslim communities.  While informants acknowledged \nthe need to adopt condoms within sexual relationships, discussion centered on \nthe fact that low condom use could be blamed on the suspicion that requesting \ncondom use induced in marriage partners (Kagimu, Marum, Wabire-Mangen & \nHogle, 1998).  Comparable problems articulated in workshops with Zairian \nmarried women were solved through participatory workshops and role plays that \nallowed women to develop effective strategies to broach this topic in a manner \nacceptable to their husbands (Schoepf, 1993).  Among school children qualitative \nevaluation, in the form of focus groups and workshops, was used as a means of \nestablishing the acceptability of methods used, thus leading to the development \nof more refined interventions (C\u00e1ceres, Rosasco, Mandel & Hearst, 1994; Kuhn \net al., 1994). \n 20 \n \n \nQualitative evaluation through participatory observation allowed Lyttleton (1994) \nto formulate ideas about the behavioural and psychological responses of a rural \nThai village to a government AIDS media campaign.  While levels of knowledge \n(indicated through KAPB survey) were high, translation into behaviour change \nwas minimal.  Lyttleton\u2019s observational evaluation highlights arguments for \nlocation specific interventions by indicating factors such as villagers inability to \nview \u2018local injection doctors\u2019 as doctors who should sterilize needles between \nuses.  Perhaps the most successful qualitative evaluation, and one which uses \nqualitative evaluation alone, was undertaken in Zaire among sex workers.  \nSchoepf (1993) conducted user-focused evaluations in which project staff \nobserved sex workers teaching methods and material to new groups of subjects.  \nThis allowed the intervention team not only to evaluate uptake of information but \nalso to establish that participatory methods were firmly entrenched within the \nfunctioning of the project. \n \nThe studies highlighted above indicate the continued focus of intervention \nevaluations on quantitative methods despite the rich data that could be unearthed \nthrough qualitative methodologies. While quantitative research methods are \nimportant within the unavoidable reality of a funding culture where programmes \nare expected to 'prove' to funders that they have achieved quantifiable short-term \nresults, we argue that they have less value in relation to the broader task of \nunderstanding the processes by which programmes have these quantifiable \neffects (enabling us to learn something about sexuality and behaviour change in \ngeneral, rather than simply about the results of one particular programme), and \nthe extent to which programme results are likely to be sustainable over time. It is \nonly through in-depth qualitative studies that we are likely to develop our \nunderstandings of such processes. Qualitative approaches are usually an \nessential component of process evaluation strategies, the topic of the next \nsection. \n \n2) Relative neglect of 'process evaluation' strategies  \nIn developing their account of what should be the appropriate focus of process \nanalyses, Aggleton et al. (1992) indicate that communication between the project \nstaff and target communities should be the major form of assessment of the \nprocesses underlying why a project did or did not succeed.  Campbell and \nWilliams (1998), however, disagree arguing that this definition is too narrow and \nrequires further expansion.  Such expansion might include attention to, for \nexample, the extent to which target audiences identify with the project; the \norganisational context of the project; the relationships between the project and \nother organisations; the national policy context in which the project operates; the \nextent to which the project engenders the transformation of sexual norms and \nidentities on a societal level; and the extent to which adequate resources are \navailable for meeting project goals within their definition of process evaluation. \n \nThe interventions described in our literature of interest show a clear bias in favour \nof outcome evaluation strategies.  The use of pre- and post-test methodologies \nenable researchers to quantify the uptake of knowledge and changes in STD \nprevalence through comparisons between test scores at the start of programmes \nand the final scores once programmes have been completed.  From this type of \n 21 \n \nevaluation one is able to deduce that changes in target communities have been \nachieved; explanations for the reasons behind these changes are seldom given.  \nExceptions here include the efforts that have been made to obtain a clearer \nunderstanding of the processes leading to the observed outcomes in studies of \ninterventions involving school children (C\u00e1ceres et al., 1994; Kuhn et al., 1994; \nMunodawafa et al., 1995).  In these evaluations students engaged in the \nintervention as well as teachers or facilitators were asked to evaluate the actual \nintervention.  Comments received in this way were then utilised in planning further \ninterventions and refining techniques.  The same approach has also been \nadopted among sex workers in Ghana (Asamoah-Adu et al., 1994). \n \nWhile the four studies mentioned above have attempted to incorporate some \nform of process evaluation in their design, the most sophisticated forms of \nprocess evaluation can be seen in the work of Schoepf (1993) and Asthana and \nOostvogels (1996).  The work of Schoepf among the women of Zaire has been \nmentioned previously as an example of an intervention making use of both \nparticipatory intervention methods and qualitative evaluation.  In terms of process \nevaluation, Schoepf offers important explanations for the reasons behind \nchanges in the use of condoms.  During much of the study there was a reported \nincrease in the number of protected sex acts.  Schoepf begins to explore some of \nthe psycho-social issues highlighted by Campbell and Williams (1998) when she \nattributes this to two major factors.  In the first instance the project enabled \nmarried women to learn means of encouraging their husbands to use condoms \nas contraceptives rather than prophylaxis through discussion about the high costs \nof education and the need to limit family size.  In the second case, increased \ncondom use could not be fully attributed to the programme but rather to the \ndeaths from AIDS of two sex workers within the network.  Sex workers within the \nproject were appreciative that they had learned the value of condoms before the \nsudden increase in condom use that followed these deaths.  At eight months \npost-intervention sex workers engaged in the project reported a decline in the \nnumber of protected sex acts.  An interview with Jonathan Kolodney in Paris-\nMatch had been erroneously interpreted by students in Kinshasa as indicating the \nuselessness of condoms for combating HIV infection.  Viewed as an educated \nelite and valued client-base the students were one of the few sources of AIDS \ninformation the sex workers had.  Differences in social standing and economic \ndependence therefore encouraged the sex workers to believe what the students \nhad told them. \n \nThe intervention aimed at empowering sex workers in Madras provides one of the \nrichest sources of process evaluation despite the authors themselves stating that \nevaluation fell by the wayside in favour of intervention (Asthana & Oostvogels, \n1996).  The eventual demise of the intervention was due to a number of \nseemingly minor issues which combined to overwhelm the efforts of the project \nstaff and sex worker community.  The initial part of the intervention had been \nplanned and implemented through an external WHO consultant; once control was \nhanded to a local NGO, their lack of political leverage and practical experience in \nrunning interventions caused many of the project objectives to flounder.  \nContinued harassment from police in Madras finally culminated in a crackdown \nforcing all brothels in the intervention area to either close or relocate.  Significant \nrelationships on which much of the intervention was based were consequently \n 22 \n \nlost.  However, the nature and organisation of sex work within the various \ncommunities had the most consequential impact on the intervention.  Initial \nenthusiasm among the sex worker peer educators could not be maintained once \nthe initial \u2018scare\u2019 factor of AIDS had worn off.  Many found it increasingly hard to \nmaintain their enthusiasm for peer education when they lost clients (and money) \ndue to the time the intervention took and the fact that the message they spread \nwas a threat to the perceived self-interests of their clients.  Power structures \nwithin Madras society were also perceived to have a negative impact on the \nproject in a number of ways.  Firstly, educated clients were often not prepared to \nlisten to brokers\u2019 safe sex messages as they felt themselves to be socially \nsuperior.  Secondly, the development of community organization was difficult \namong sex workers who lived in isolated communities and maintained their \nsubservient relationships with their brothel-owners and brokers in the face of \nvulnerability to police and clients. \n \nIn keeping with their commitment to explaining some of the processes underlying \nthe outcomes of interventions, Asthana and Oostvogels (1996) make a number of \nuseful comments about the organisational context of the Madras project thus \nhighlighting issues raised by Gillies (1998) and Campbell and Williams (1998) \nreferred to in the introductory section; \n\uf0b7 National policy as a favourable context in which to conduct local health \nwork: The authors evaluate their intervention in the light of the changing \nattitudes to HIV\/AIDS being felt within the Indian government.  The National \nAIDS Prevention and Control Programme (NAPCP) has moved from a focus \non surveillance of \u2018high-risk groups\u2019 towards educational and support-based \nAIDS messages.  A part of this changed attitude has been the \nencouragement of alliances with non-governmental organisations (NGO) \nand grassroots mobilisation.  The NAPCP realisation that too little was \nknown about sex workers in India led to the development of relationships \nwith the World Health Organisation. \n\uf0b7 Communication between programme and target audience: The intervention \nteam was aware of the problems facing them in attempting to create a \nsense of community in a diverse and disparate group of sex workers.  To \nthis end an open office policy with interaction between project staff and sex \nworkers was promoted.  Through communication and the provision of a \nmeeting place the project fostered some sense of community among the \ndifferent groups. \n\uf0b7 Relationships between the project and other organisations: This aspect of \nprocess evaluation has already been touched on in examining the role that \nthe local Madras police played in the intervention.  Despite changes in the \nofficial government attitude towards HIV risk groups such as sex workers, \npolice continue to penalize sex workers under the Suppression of Immoral \nTraffic Act.  The strained relationship between sex workers and police was \nevaluated as one of the factors involved in the loss of important alliances. \n\uf0b7 Organisational context of project: Evaluation of the changing role of the \nproject highlights the change in organisation which took place during1993 \nwhen responsibility was handed over to a local NGO without the necessary \nexperience and political affiliations to adequately promote the project. \n \n 23 \n \nFrom the examples provided above by Schoepf (1993) and Asthana and \nOostvogels (1996) the benefits of process evaluation become clear.  Through \noutcome evaluation the intervention in India would have been termed a failure \nand the data would have suggested that few of the intervention objectives had \nbeen met.  Process evaluation, however, highlights the particular circumstances \nof the intervention and makes it possible to develop an understanding of the \nfactors acting for and against the intervention objectives.  This is done in a way \nthat can be generalised to an understanding of other programmes in other \ncontexts.  It is only through a detailed account of obstacles facing the \ninterventions of this sort that lessons can be learned for future projects. \n \n3) Over-reliance on the individual level of analysis \nThe conceptual tools that are used are often ones that favour the individual level \nof analysis.  HIV\/STD interventions have adopted methods which seek to impact \nnot only on the individual but also on the community which acts on and influences \nthe individual.  From the analysis of the evaluation content of these interventions \nit is clear that researchers have yet to find a way which effectively evaluates the \ncontribution of interventions to community and social processes.  Evaluations are \nall concentrated at the individual level of analysis and while they do provide \nindications of the extent to which interventions have succeeded in achieving their \nstated aims, they fail to explain the deeper processes promoted within the \nintervention community. \n \nIn most studies (34 studies) evaluation is achieved by exploring knowledge, \nbeliefs, attitudes and practices through administering individual questionnaires to \nselected groups.  Other evaluative methods include individual STD and HIV tests \nand recording of numbers of unprotected sex acts (25 studies).  As we have \nalready stated, in the few studies that do try and incorporate attention to broader \nsocial factors beyond the biomedical and behavioural levels of analysis, such \nqualitative material is often presented in the form of anecdotes or of fairly \nunsystematic personal observations by authors of papers, rather than in a \nrigorous way, using well-defined concepts and indicators.  Indeed, Antunes et al. \n(1997) bemoan the fact that there are no evaluative measures of the community \nprocesses promoted by intervention programmes.  In their Brazilian intervention \nthey indicate that the sexual decision-making of adolescents cannot be separated \nfrom their reproductive choices and socially determined sexual roles they engage \nwith.  Changes in these aspects have been felt but their measurement or \nevaluation remain problematic. \n 24 \n \nConclusion  \n \nIn this paper we have reviewed the published literature which deals with the \nevaluation of HIV-prevention programmes in developing countries.  Our review \nsuggests that such programmes often seek to encourage community-level processes \nsuch as participation, representation and empowerment.  However, this \"paradigm \ndrift\" (Beeker et al., 1998) away from purely biomedical and behavioural approaches \ntowards attempts to create health-enabling community contexts, is often not reflected \nin evaluation methodologies.  \n \nIn the literature we reviewed evaluation methodologies were mostly quantitative, \noutcomes orientated and concerned with the individual level of analysis.  Few of the \nstudies examined here made rigorous use of qualitative evaluation, indicating the \nproblems facing researchers in their efforts to firstly, collect such information and \nsecondly, to present it in an acceptable way to the scientific community.  Evaluation \nconcentrated primarily on the individual level of analysis through the use of largely \nbiomedical outcomes measures such as HIV or STD rates and the changes \nobserved in KAPB questionnaires.  While some of the interventions attempted to \nencourage change at the community and social level, the representation of these \nchanges through evaluation remains problematic. \n \nOne reason for this very narrow approach to evaluation is a funding culture which \npressurises programme organisers to provide evidence of 'quick fix' changes, \nmeasured in discrete quantifiable terms that will appeal to the biomedical fraternity \nwho often dominate the field of HIV-prevention. Another reason for this is that we \ncurrently lack adequate conceptual understandings of the mechanisms or pathways \nwhereby community development processes (such as participation, representation or \n'community partnerships for health') serve to mediate between intervention activities \nand health outcomes (Campbell & Mzaidume, 1999). \n \nIn the introductory section we highlighted three areas of research in which \nhypotheses regarding psycho-social and community-level factors which might serve \nto promote programme success have been sought. Campbell and Williams (1998) \nargue that programmes are likely to succeed to the extent that they promote psycho-\nsocial changes, including increased self-efficacy amongst target audience members, \nas well as providing opportunities for the collective re-negotiation of social and sexual \nidentities. Kreuter  (1998) states that the intervention-community interface is an \nimportant determinant of programme success, suggesting that a key determinant of \nsuccess is the extent to which communities have a range of formal and informal \nnetworks and resources that are broadly supportive of what the programme is trying \nto achieve. They also emphasise that community members should trust and identify \nwith the programme. Gillies (1998) highlights the importance of the intervention being \nlinked into a network of similar interventions, as well as the importance of alliances \nbetween grassroots interventions and representatives of broader provincial and \nnational programmes and policies in the public, private and voluntary spheres. None \nof these hypotheses are currently adequately operationalisable in concrete \nquantifiable indicators, which could be used to evaluate programme success or \nfailure, in a way that moves beyond the narrow biomedical and behavioural outcome \nmeasures which currently dominate programme evaluation. \n \n 25 \n \nWe argue that rigorously conducted and systematically documented qualitative \nprocess evaluations of concrete interventions could make a key contribution to our \nunderstanding of these psycho-social, organisational and community-level processes \n- and as such could make a key contribution to not only the development of the \nscience\/art of programme evaluation, but also to the development of more \nsuccessful HIV-prevention interventions. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThanks to Brian Williams of the CSIR, coordinator of the evaluation of the \nMothusimpilo HIV-prevention Project, for his comments on the manuscript, as well as \nfor his more general input into the authors\u2019 early discussions of the paper. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAbdool Karim, S.S.
