Self-management programmes generally aim to \nsupport healthy living by improving self-efficacy and health knowledge (Pearson et al., \n2007). Diabetes is an area which has seen a plethora of initiatives in recent years and \nthere is evidence that self-management can reduce long-term complications \n(Brownson et al., 2009). Diabetes is a chronic and debilitating disease characterised by \nan inability to regulate blood glucose levels adequately and its prevalence is rising \nrapidly. There are 2.8 million people currently diagnosed with diabetes in the UK \n(Diabetes UK, 2011). Day-to-day management is carried out almost exclusively by the \npatient and can often be complex and emotionally challenging, meaning that many do \nnot achieve good control over their blood glucose levels. For patients to be effective \nself-managers of their diabetes they need to be provided with the information and \nsupport necessary to make informed decisions. \n \nInterventions based on new technologies have the potential to support individuals to \neffectively manage their diabetes over a lifetime (Chen & Li, 2009). Technological \ninnovations include interactive websites, automated telephone calls, touchscreen \nkiosks, mobile devices and DVDs (Piette, 2007), but have mixed results (Welch & \nShayne, 2006; Costa et al., 2009). Initiatives that mobilize and build on online peer \nsupport have been described as a particularly promising way to improve self-\nmanagement support (Heisler, 2010). For example, anonymous internet-based \ninformation exchange and interaction with other patients has been shown to be a key \nstrategy providing autonomy and a feeling of control for young women with diabetes \nmanaging life transitions (Rasmussen et al., 2007), and posting messages in online \nPage 2 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n3 \n \nforums has been shown to bring benefits relating to social support, information \nexchange and sharing of experience for adolescents (Ravert et al., 2004).   \n  \nIn recent years the internet has become an increasingly important resource for health \nconsumers. A 2009 survey found that 70 per cent of United Kingdom households now \nhave internet access (over 18 million households), and 42 per cent of internet users \nhave used the internet for health information within the last three months, a significant \nincrease from 34% in 2008 (Office of National Statistics). Similarly, a survey conducted \nin 2009 found that 74 per cent of United States adults use the internet, and 83 per cent \nof internet users have used the internet for health information (Pew Internet and \nAmerican Life Project, 2010). Perceptions of the internet as a source of health \ninformation appear to be changing. A survey of ehealth trends in seven European \ncountries found that in 2005 6.5% of the population perceived the internet as an \nimportant source of health information, whereas by 2007 this figure had risen to 46.8% \n(Kummervold, 2008). \n \nAs health-related internet use has grown, the sociological literature has considered \nwhether the informed e-consumer presents a challenge to professional dominance \n(Hardey, 1999) or whether online health information continues to support a model of \nbiomedical authority (Fox et al., 2005; Nettleton et al., 2005). Research on peer-to peer \ninteraction in virtual communities suggests that these too can reinforce mainstream \ndiscourses of medical knowledge (Fox et al., 2005; Sandaunet, 2008). At the same \ntime, they can address issues not dealt with (or at least not to individuals\u2019 satisfaction) \nin traditional settings (Sandaunet, 2008; Schaffer et al., 2008).  \n \n \nPage 3 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n4 \n \nThe emergent body of literature on online health communities in general supports a \nmodel of \u2018empowerment within limits\u2019 where the individual user has the opportunity to \nfeel more competent or in control through the peer-led exchange of information and \nemotionally supportive messages, within the cultural constraints of the particular \ncommunity being accessed.  Empowerment comes from information exchange (Fox et \nal., 2005; Coulson, 2005), emotional and social support (Bar-Lev, 2008), access to \nothers in similar situations (Schaffer et al., 2008; Powell & Clarke, 2006), and other \nfactors which facilitate user empowerment such as feelings of control and autonomy \n(van Uden-Kraan et al., 2009; Lemire et al., 2008).  Through the sharing of experiential \ninformation, users can re-shape ideas of authoritative knowledge (Schaffer et al., 2008) \nand construct online identities as expert patients (Fox & Ward, 2006).  \n \nOnline communities are not without their problems, though. For example, in addition to \nthese positive outcomes, studies of computer-mediated communication have also often \ncommented on the phenomenon of online hostilities of variable intensity such as \ndisagreements, criticism or aggressive emotional outbursts (Burnett and Buerkle, \n2004) that can potentially cause stress and anxiety both for the interactants involved \nand other community members. If the potential benefits of online communities are to \nbe most effectively harnessed then it is important to understand how they develop from \nthe very early stages as the community\u2019s character is likely to be established relatively \nquickly and may then prove difficult to change. Understanding the processes through \nwhich a community\u2019s character develops highlights useful lessons that those setting \nup, or moderating, such communities could learn from as they seek to ensure they are \nas effective as possible at promoting information-sharing and supporting users to feel \nconfident in their ability to manage their condition.  \n \nPage 4 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n5 \n \nThe vast majority of studies analysing peer-to-peer discussion fora have focused on \npublicly accessible websites, and have taken an opportunistic sample of online \ncommunication over a set period. This approach can be found in many contexts for \nboth common conditions including diabetes (Ravert et al., 2004;), pregnancy \n(Fredriksen et al., 2008), and cancer (Gooden & Winefield, 2007) and rarer diseases, \nsuch as Huntington\u2019s disease  and primary biliary cirrhosis (Coulson et al., 2007; \nLasker et al., 2005). While this approach is helpful in exploring how an established \ndiscussion forum operates, the topics that are discussed, and the different ways \nindividual users navigate the forum, it does not allow exploration of how the character \nof the forum is shaped by its users during the very early days of its existence, and how \nissues of identity and authority are established.  \n \nIn this paper we explore precisely these issues by presenting data drawn from a \npurpose-built discussion board only available to known participants within a research \nproject as part of a broader pilot study of an internet-based diabetes self-management \ntool. We demonstrate how the identity of the community was established early on by its \nusers, and how this acted to shape the kinds of interactions and discussions that took \nplace thereafter. We also discuss the important ways in which individuals sought to \nestablish themselves as reliable and authoritative sources of information.  \n \nMethods  \nThe data presented in this article were collected as part of a wider programme to \ndevelop and pilot the Virtual Clinic internet-based self-management system for \ndiabetes (author citation). This work consisted of three main stages: (i) a detailed \nconsultation with a variety of stakeholder groups, including patients and relevant health \nprofessionals; (ii) a hands-on pre-test session with patients, followed by a focus group \nPage 5 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n6 \n \nto elicit their views; and (iii) a 6-month pilot study. This paper is based on data \ncollected during the pilot study phase.  \n \nParticipants \nThe study was reviewed and given a favourable opinion by the West Midlands Multi-\ncentre Research Ethics Committee. The particular group of patients we worked with \nwere adults who all used insulin pumps providing continuous subcutaneous insulin \ninfusion to manage their Type 1 diabetes. Participants were recruited by convenience \nsampling, as is appropriate for pilot or exploratory work (Green and Thorogood, 2004), \nfrom three UK hospitals in the West and East Midlands. Health professionals within the \nthree study sites issued recruitment packs to all eligible patients in their clinics. The \nrecruitment pack contained a letter inviting patients to participate and an information \nsheet outlining the research and what participation would involve. All the participants \nwere over 18 years of age, had used an insulin pump for at least 6 months, could \ncommunicate effectively in written and spoken English (we had no resources for \ntranslation), had internet access, and reported they possessed basic computer literacy \nskills. Patients were informed that participation was voluntary and that refusing \nparticipation or withdrawing from the study at any time would not affect the standard of \ncare they received.  \n \nThe study involved 17 patients who used the Virtual Clinic over a period of six months. \nThe study sample consisted of six males and 11 females and the age range of \nparticipants was 22 to 70 years. All participants reported themselves as being of white \nBritish ethnicity, with eight being educated to undergraduate level or above. All \nparticipants described themselves as regular users of the internet, with 11 reporting \ndaily use, and most reporting using it more than once a week. On average, \nrespondents reported using the internet for 8.9 hours a week. \nPage 6 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n7 \n \n \nThe forum \nThe Virtual Clinic tool had three main features: (i) secure messaging between patients \nand their health professionals; (ii) relevant links to further internet-based information \nand support; and (iii) asynchronous peer-to-peer discussion board, from which the data \npresented in this paper are drawn. The Virtual Clinic was password-protected and only \navailable to the participants involved and those working directly on the study. \nParticipants in the pilot study were asked to log-in to the Virtual Clinic at least once a \nweek, but were free to use the features within it as much or as little as they wished. \nData from the discussion board were captured on a weekly basis throughout the six-\nmonth pilot study.  \n \nThe discussion board was not anticipatorily moderated; each message posted \nappeared without prior scrutiny. A system of reactive moderation was used in which \nthe discussion board was regularly reviewed by the research team, and participants \nwere encouraged to report postings they regarded as problematic. No such reports \nwere made and review by the research team did not identify any problems. As a result \nno postings were amended or deleted during the study.  \n \nThe suggestion that participants use the Virtual Clinic\u2019s features as much or as little as \nthey wished and the reactive approach to moderation adopted, together mean that the \n\u2018social design\u2019 of the discussion board (Bar-Lev, 2008) was very light touch. This \napproach, in particular the lack of formal guidelines for usage, may have influenced the \nway in which the community developed and played a role in establishing the overall \nsocial atmosphere. \n \nAnalytic approach \nPage 7 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n8 \n \nWe use thematic discourse analysis (Potter and Wetherell, 1987; Braun and Clarke, \n2006) to apply insights from discursive psychology (Edwards, 1997) to the thematic \ncategories identified in the online accounts. A distinct feature of thematic discourse \nanalysis is the focus on both the rhetorical composition of themes and the \naccompanying assumptions (Peel et al, 2005). According to Potter and Wetherell \n(1987) the approach consists of two phases: a search for patterns in the data \nfollowed by analysis of the function or purpose of the identified themes. This \nprocess represents the \u2018latent\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018semantic\u2019 approach to analysis in \nthat it \u2018goes beyond the semantic content of the data, and starts to identify or examine \nthe underlying ideas, assumptions, and conceptualizations -- and ideologies -- that are \ntheorized as shaping or informing the semantic content of the data\u2019 (Braun and Clarke, \n2006: 84, original emphasis). The approach has been adopted in various studies of \nhealth and illness discourses (Singer and Hunter, 1999; Peel et al, 2005), and has \nalso proved useful in online social research (Walstrom, 2004).  \n \nIn this study, thematic analysis of the discussion board postings was based upon the \nconstant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). Each message was read 3-\n4 times and open codes initially applied line-by-line in order to represent the meaning \nor significance of each sentence or group of sentences. The open codes were then \nincrementally grouped into organising categories or themes.  These categories were \nthen modified and checked constantly as further open codes were incorporated. The \ncategories and their specifications (the coding scheme) were then programmed into \nthe NVivo qualitative software.  The coding scheme was used to process the dataset \nsystematically by assigning each section of text to a category, according to the \ncategory specifications. The identified categories served as primary lenses for our \nanalysis of identity construction through such socio-interactional business as \nestablishing legitimacy and displaying competence (Edwards, 1997). We then turned to \nPage 8 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n9 \n \ndiscursive psychology to identify and describe the latter processes, as this approach \nenables a detailed examination of identity construction through the lens of \n\u2018accountability work\u2019 (Potter and Wetherell, 1987). In this way, discursive psychology \nallowed us to deepen our analytical understanding of the legitimating and supportive \nfunctions of participants\u2019 exchanges, indexed in the structural features identified via the \nconstant comparison method. \n \nIn following the discursive psychology approach, we examined how participants \ncreated legitimacy and authority within the broader rhetorical and interactional \nprocesses of eliciting, giving, and receiving practical advice and emotional support \n(Harrison and Barlow, 2009). Such a non-cognitivist approach treats identities as social \nphenomena; when people describe events, \u2018they attend to accountability. That is to \nsay, they attend to events in terms of what is normal, expectable and proper (Edwards, \n1997: 7).  Participants\u2019 replies (or next turns) were used for validating our interpretation \nof an initial post\/question (Seale, 1999). However, unlike previous analyses of \ninteraction in long-standing, well-established online fora, we did not focus on individual \nnarratives per se but instead attempted to explore how the discursive management of \nparticipants\u2019 identities might have contributed to, and have been influenced by the \nemergence and maintenance of the group\u2019s collective identity. Here the classification \nof features characterising an online group as a community, namely identity, sociability \nand support, is particularly apposite (see Herring, 2004). Active participation and \ncontinuous interaction of its members (sociability) allows an online group to develop \nshared norms and values as well as create an awareness of its distinguishing features \n(identity). By demonstrating solidarity and reciprocity and following any existing as well \nas emerging social participation guidelines, members can then maintain the group \n(support) (Herring, 2004). From this perspective, online discursive community is seen \nPage 9 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n10 \n \nas first and foremost a \u2018mutable construct, determined by social actors who create \nmeaning about it\u2019 (Fernback, 2007: 66). \n \nFindings \nTopics discussed \nThe discussion board was active throughout the six months of the pilot study, although \nusage as a whole gradually declined over this period. In total, 34 distinct discussion \nthreads (by which we mean a series of related communications on a particular topic) \nwere created with a total of 219 individual messages posted across these. The \ndiscussion board emerged as the most valued feature based on both qualitative and \nquantitative user feedback (author citations). \n \nThe issues discussed centred around three core areas. Firstly, and as to be expected, \nthere was a substantial focus on issues related to diabetes self-management. These \ndiscussions tended to revolve around the challenges faced by participants in achieving \nand maintaining good control of their blood glucose. Blood glucose levels featured \nprominently as an indicator of control in many of the messages posted as participants \nreported unexpectedly high or low levels and described (sometimes at length) their \nattempts to understand the symptoms they were experiencing and regain some feeling \nof control (Charmaz, 2000). Secondly, participants were also keen to receive \ninformation about and discuss new possibilities or future treatments. These could be \nnew developments per se (such as possible new treatment options or medical \nadvances that might be on the horizon), or simply things they had not yet experienced \nthemselves to date. In the latter case, participants were particularly keen to hear from \nother users who may have had diabetes for a longer period or have experienced \ncomplications that they themselves could see approaching. Thirdly, a distinct group of \nthreads involved coping psychologically with diabetes, for example sharing and \nPage 10 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n11 \n \nexchanging ideas about how to \u2018look on the bright side\u2019 and see the possible \u2018silver \nlinings\u2019 of the condition. \n \nDeveloping the community\u2019s identity and boundaries \nDiabetes-focused, with no space for purely social interaction \nThere was a relatively clear distinction between a small minority of, typically younger, \nparticipants who initially appeared to want the discussion board to act as a general \nsocial interaction space and the majority who were simply concerned with discussing \ndiabetes-related issues. Those that fell into the former group created and participated \nin a small number of discussion threads in the very early days that were designed \nspecifically to find out more about others as individuals rather than just as people who \nhad diabetes. However, these were often not replied to and stopped appearing as the \ndays and weeks passed. In contrast, frequent postings on practical issues of diabetes \nmanagement received positive appraisal: \n \nRE: Welcome to the Virtual Clinic! \nWhat a lot of activity since I last logged on. All very useful info and views.  \n(Participant 1, male) \n \nAlthough emotional support was also acknowledged, the most common way of \nexpressing gratitude was to thank other participants for their \u2018informative\u2019 replies.  \nAs a result, the discussions that took place within the community came to focus solely \non diabetes-related issues.  \n \nCreating and maintaining solidarity and support \nAlthough active social interaction was implicitly discouraged, participants developed \ndifferent ways of eliciting social information during their diabetes-specific interaction, \nPage 11 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n12 \n \nwhich allowed them to conform to the unspoken rule of prioritising informational \nexchange.

This rhetorical work, referred to as \u2018the rhetoric of gratitude\u2019 (Arminen, 2001), \nseemed to have functioned as an important social glue that might have facilitated \nparticipation in this community from its inception onwards. One of the indicators \npointing to this effect was an increase of newcomers who might have \u2018lurked\u2019 for some \ntime on the forum trying to learn the local interactional ropes before deciding to \ncontribute. Approximately a month after the start of the group, both existing and new \nmembers began to post more personal questions that can be seen as potentially \ncompromising their identity as \u2018sensible\u2019 or rational individuals. The following question \nabout having children with diabetes is an example:  \n \nDiabetes and Pregnancy \nPage 13 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n14 \n \nHello. . . .

I'm hoping people on here can give me some \nanswers etc. [\u2026] Ok . . . here goes (congratulate me on my bravery)  \n(Participant 16, female) \n \nThe above post contains a number of hedging devices used to demonstrate the \nauthor\u2019s feelings of insecurity about participation and expectations of this group. \nAlthough we have no direct evidence, it may be plausible that earlier discussions on \nthis site made the person feel safe (Mitra, 2006) as they had been observing the spirit \nof \u2018togetherness\u2019 and good natured expressions of mutual support and respect.  \n \nOverall, through references to shared experiences and the rhetoric of gratitude this \ndiscussion forum started to function as an interactional mechanism for enabling and \nfostering the exchange of practical information and support. As one of the participants \nstated in his \u2018goodbye\u2019 post: \u2018I think the beauty of this forum has been to remind us that \nwe're not on our own. Don't ever give up!\u2019 \n \nTesting the limits \nOne of biggest rhetorical challenges faced by people who consider participating in an \nonline group is demonstrating their legitimacy \u2013 that their discursive contributions are \ngenuine and valid. Other studies have shown that when joining a long established \nonline forum participants draw on their history of disease, past experiences, and\/or \ntailor their posts to the most discussed topics to legitimate their claim for the group\u2019s \nattention (Gallagher et al, 1998). In this study we had an opportunity to examine how, \nin the absence of prior discussions, the very first posts served simultaneously to create \nlegitimacy and test the limits of what can or cannot be discussed.

I have always, with great effort, managed to get good HBA results but, \nbeing averages, the HBA results do not show the often wild blood sugar \nfluctuations I suffered before using an insulin pump. To clarify, BG readings of \n2mm and 11mm are obviously bad news, and yet they give an \"average\" of \n6.5mm, often described to me as \"excellent\".

After undermining potential assumptions regarding a lack of competence \nin interpreting BG readings (\u20182mm and 11mm are obviously bad news\u2019), the participant \nproceeds to introduce a thinly veiled criticism of \u2018the Doctors\u2019.  \n \nThis reference to prior interaction with medical authorities was quickly picked up and \nexpanded upon by other members on this \u2018introductory\u2019 thread: \n \nRE: Welcome to the Virtual Clinic!  \nI sometimes wonder whether the experts have got their lines crossed as some \nwill tell you that the peaks and troughs are all important, others that it is only the \n3 monthly HbA1c that is significant.

The \nfollowing example relates to a post concerning the effect of diabetes on pregnancy: \n \nDiabetes and Pregnancy \nFirstly, I'm in no rush to have children (but) my ultimate worry is diabetes \naffecting my ability to have 'healthy' babies, and the complications that I will incur \netc etc. It\u2019s all the things you read, like if you plan to have a baby you must tell \nyour specialist a few months before to get stable sugars, and then during the first \nfew weeks your blood will go mad and you have to keep it stable. Then there\u2019s \nthe bit about the baby getting really big, and recently there was something about \nbabies being born having a dependency on insulin. Also years ago a nurse told \nme I would never be able to give birth I would have to have a c section . . .

In \nresponse to such an interactional environment, participant 15 carefully manages her \nresponse by using a softener (\u2018just some input on this\u2019) followed by a short story \ndrawing on her own experience as a mother but additionally highlighting her \nexperience of working on a special care baby unit (although she does not specify in \nwhat capacity). In addition to functioning as a politeness strategy of demonstrating \nempathy and enabling indirect advice giving, the short one-sentence story (\u2018I found \nthat\u2026\u2019) also helps to construct the participant as experientially knowledgeable. The \nparticipant then switches from personal to professional source of expertise using the \nphrase \u2018from a prof point of view\u2019 to bring in the biomedical discourse and \naccompanying factual references (\u2018diabetics always have bigger babies\u2019). \n \nA small number of users presented themselves as authoritative and knowledgeable \nthrough references to their activity and research in the area of diabetes, and by \nemphasizing that they went to great lengths to keep themselves well-informed and up-\nto-date with medical knowledge and new developments.

The \nfollowing extract is a particularly powerful example in which one individual describes \nhow he had noticed a correlation between episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (low \nblood glucose) or \u2018hypos\u2019 and sudden and severe drops in the temperature.  \n \nRE: The Weather  \n29 years ago when I first became unstable diabetic, trying to stay upright was far \nmore difficult, as there were no home blood-testing kits and severe hypos were \nthus far more frequent. After the first 3 A&E visits (in as many weeks) I couldn\u2019t \nunderstand what I had done wrong, having stuck religiously to what \u2018rules\u2019 there \nwere. Then I suddenly realised that the common denominator was sudden and \nsevere drops in temperature, which had happened immediately before each \nincident. I told the \u2018professionals\u2019 about this but they all humoured me and clearly \nthought I was talking rubbish and making lame excuses for carelessness. \nRecently, the \u2018temperature factor\u2019 has been officially recognised, and is written in \ntext-books. The same \u2018professionals\u2019 give you the same advice (now scientifically \nsmothered) that you originally gave them, in plain English, a long time before\u2026. \n(Participant 9, male) \n \nParticipant 9 states that, whilst he felt that health professionals had humoured him at \nthe time rather than taking his idea seriously, medical text books were now beginning \nto include this information, thereby endorsing the idea that he had advanced sometime \nearlier. The telling of this story works to construct this participant as someone who is \nPage 21 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n22 \n \nactually \u2018ahead of the game\u2019 and with whom the professional community will eventually \n\u2018catch-up\u2019. This strategy might be particularly effective with other participants who feel \nthat their health professionals are not taking their ideas or experiences seriously.  \n \nGoing too far \nAs explained earlier, we adopted a reactive approach to moderation, meaning that all \nmessages posted were immediately visible without prior scrutiny. Instead, we regularly \nreviewed content, and participants were encouraged to notify us of any messages they \nregarded as problematic. No messages were brought to our attention during the study. \nIn fact, on the rare occasions that a particular comment was perceived by participants \nas inappropriate or as having \u2018gone too far\u2019, it was quickly dealt with by either \nthemselves or other participants. This is demonstrated in the following example, in \nwhich one user\u2019s advice to adopt a particular weight loss strategy (cutting down on the \namount of insulin taken) is quickly problematised and highlighted as dangerous by \nanother user: \n \nLosing weight \nNext of my questions\u2026has anyone got any hints on how to lose weight? I don\u2019t \neat loads, I eat healthy food and I go to the gym, however it won\u2019t shift.

We can see that the community, through its individual members, came to \nactively negotiate and enforce the boundaries surrounding what could and could not be \nexpressed. As a result the community came to develop a particular identity. \n \nDiscussion  \nOur study showed that a small number of motivated users who shared specific health \ncharacteristics (having type 1 diabetes and using insulin pumps) who were recruited to \na closed internet forum participated in focussed discussions over a sustained period of \ntime. The main topics discussed related to self-management of blood glucose levels, \ninformation on new treatments, and illness coping strategies, therefore indicating the \nformation of a task-oriented group. This is not surprising given the clear parameters \nunder which the community was constructed and the individual participants recruited.  \n \nAs has been found in other online support groups, user empowerment can be fostered \nthrough the sharing of information (Fox et al., 2005; Coulson, 2005), and the promotion \nof self-confidence and feelings of independence and control (van Uden-Kraan et al., \n2009; Lemire et al., 2008). This is especially important in long-term conditions such as \nPage 23 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n24 \n \ndiabetes where self-efficacy (the belief that one has the capabilities to execute the \ncourses of action required to manage prospective situations) has been shown to have \na positive relationship with successful self-management and better health outcomes \n(Brownson et al., 2009). Indeed, studies of other internet-based diabetes communities \nhave shown positive effects on self-management (for example, Rasmussen et al., \n2007). \n \nHealth-related internet communities are clearly subject to the social psychological \nprocesses present in all groups, as well as those more specifically found in online \nsettings (Bargh & McKenna, 2004). For example, normative social influence and \nintragroup conformity occurs online, even in anonymous settings (Sassenberg & \nJonas, 2007). We were particularly interested in how, in a new community, issues of \nidentity and authority were interactively managed. Participants used brief stories to \nmake indirect suggestions, which also served to demonstrate shared concerns and \nexperiences as well as authority. This supports the findings of Harrison and Barlow \n(2009:94) who showed how the use of short narratives in online support fora can \n\u201csimultaneously (1) function as a positive politeness strategy demonstrating empathy, \n(2) enable participants to give advice indirectly, and (3) help to construct participants\u2019 \nidentities as expert patients\u201d. Furthermore, by demonstrating how the participants were \nconstructing legitimacy and authority through online talk, this study resonates with \nrecent ethnographic research that aims to develop a nuanced understanding on online \nsocialities (Kozinets, 2010). This stream of research disputes earlier assertions by \nsocial psychologists that online communications would be characterised by a reduction \nof social cues and flattening of hierarchies (Dubrovsky et al, 1991).  \n \nIn line with the tenet that online group norms are not static but develop over time and \nchange in relation to local discursive contexts (Walstrom, 2004) we have also paid \nPage 24 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n25 \n \nattention to the temporal aspects of the online interaction.  The identity of the \ncommunity as a space for focussed discussion of diabetes, rather than for any broader \nsocial interaction, was established quickly during the first two months and the \nboundaries of this, when tested, were soon reinforced and continued to be maintained \nuntil the end of the six month period. No hostile behaviour was noted and \nmisinformation was quickly corrected. We can only speculate about the reasons for this \nlack of interest in the Virtual Clinic acting as a forum for more general social \ninteraction. It would seem likely though that, given participants valued the discussion \nboard precisely for the way it allowed them to be in touch with other people with \ndiabetes, they would not want this focus to be diverted or diluted by more general \nsocial interaction which they could (perhaps) easily gain elsewhere.  \n \nAlthough the online community under study did not demonstrate a high level of \ncommitment and interpersonal interaction observed in other, mostly non-support-\noriented online fora (e.g. Ley, 2007), this did not prevent it from establishing itself as an \nefficient instrumental grouping where participants were able to share highly targeted \npractical advice as well as emotional support. It is possible that such social \narchitectural features as reactive moderation and open-ended, non-prescriptive \nparticipation guidelines have encouraged participation and affected the nature of \ndiscursive contributions by providing a relatively secure space for the exchange of \nviews and advice.  As a result, participants successfully co-constructed their group \nidentity through shared understandings of \u2018behaviours and meanings within a collective \nrealm of action\u2019 (Fernback, 2007: 66).  \n \nThese findings are resonant with the research conducted on face-to-face groups \n(Arminen, 2004) and found that \u201cthe organization of AA members\u2019 experiences cannot \nbe located in individual turns or within individual\u2019s talk and cognitive processes. Rather, \nPage 25 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n26 \n \nAA meetings are a seamless web of interconnected turns in which speakers build their \nturns as new contributions to the context provided by previous turns\u201d (2004: 323). From \nthis perspective, the rhetorical and interactional dynamics of online support groups, \nsuch as the one investigated here, call for a further in-depth study of group-level \nphenomena that cannot be directly attributed to individual discursive acts.  \n \nLimitations \nDue to its nature as a local, pilot study the project only has a small sample and the \ninclusion criteria were relatively tight. The sample was relatively diverse in terms of age \nand educational level, but as it was drawn on the basis of convenience we cannot \nclaim to have a representative sample and other groups of participants may have \ninteracted differently. In addition, a small number of participants appear more than \nonce throughout our presentation of the findings. While we have tried to avoid this \nwhere possible, it has sometimes been necessary for example due to their key role in \nshaping the discussion forum. The fact that the discussion forum operated only as part \nof a wider study of an internet-based self-management tool means that we would \nperhaps expect the focus of discussions to be self-management and for this to be \nprioritised over more general social interaction. It is also possible that knowing they \nwere part of a research study influenced the way participants used the discussion \nforum, although in subsequent interviews participants reported using the discussion \nforum as they would other non-study related fora (author citation). Participants were \naware that the pilot study would only be for six months\u2019 duration and it is possible that \nthis knowledge influenced the way in which the identity and authority of both the group \nand its individual members were established.  \n \nConclusion \nPage 26 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n27 \n \nInternet communities can have a valuable role in engaging people with long-term \nconditions such as diabetes in issues that affect their health and health care. Internet \ndiscussion fora are shaped in important ways early on by the community of users. If \npromoting self-efficacy is the key to effective self-management, then peer-to-peer \ncommunication is a promising area and has the advantages of being  low (or indeed \nno) cost and highly acceptable to patients. However, there is a clear need to be aware \nof the social processes that shape online communities. In order to harness the \npotential benefits, health services need to acquire a multi-faceted understanding of the \nsocial processes that occur in online communities, including how the character and \nfocus of the discussion is formed over time, and how both information and individual \nusers can be constructed as authoritative and reliable. Health practitioners should note \nthat such communities can have clear empowering benefits and at the same time that \nconcerns about the propagation of inaccurate or misleading information are not \nsupported by our findings. Future research should consider the influences of \nparticipant authority and identity on the health behaviour of participants in internet \ncommunities. \n \n \nPage 27 of 35\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/health\nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n28 \n \nReferences \nArminen, I.
