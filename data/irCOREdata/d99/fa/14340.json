But there is a\ndifference in opinion as to how a partner enhances learning, and in particular how well adult\nlearners do in the collaborative setting. In order to capitalize on the opportunities offered by\nnew technologies, we need to understand more fully how the process of collaboration is\neffected by different communication technologies, and how the technologies themselves might\nbe used to best advantage for the benefit of distance learners. However, another factor, apart\nfrom the technology itself, which is thought to influence computer-supported collaborative\nlearning is in the gender distribution of the group. A number of classroom studies have shown\ngender differences when children work together with computers, and these have been reported\nfrom a number of subject-domains including science (Scanlon et al, 1993; Littleton et al,\n1992). Since our own expertise is in the area of science learning, we selected a non-trivial\nphysics task for the subjects to work with, and that is in the area of elastic collisions. Previous\nstudies (Villani and Pacca, 1990; Whitelock et al, 1993) have shown that both adults and\nschool-children have difficulty in predicting the subsequent motion of balls or ice pucks after\nthey collide. Villani's study stresses that even postgraduate students tend to revert to their\ninformal commonsense notions unless they are cued to use formal representations of these\ntypes of problem. These studies have demonstrated that the topic of elastic collisions is a\ncomplex yet fruitful one in which to engage students in group work.\n77\nDenise Wh\/te\/ock et 0\/ The influence of audio communications technology on computer-supported learning\nThe piece of research reported in this paper set out to investigate two important questions with\nrespect to communication technologies and adult learners. These were:\n1. Do pairs of students perform better when they work side by side, with a physics\nsimulation, than when their only contact with one another is via a telephone and their\nrespective computers?\n2. Does group composition with respect to gender affect task performance in the above\ntwo conditions?\nWith these questions in mind, our objectives included monitoring both group productivity and\nindividual learning in both the audio and side-by-side conditions , nd investigating whether the\ninfluence of gender had any identifiable consequences on boththese outcomes.\nMethod\nThe computer simulation\nThe PuckLand simulation version 2.6 was written in HyperCard for use with the Apple\nMacintosh. It uses a direct manipulation approach which allows students to investigate a series\nof collisions between two ice pucks. It consists of a pair of pinball-style flippers on either side\nof the screen with which subjects can flick pucks. The amount of force with which the flippers\nhit the pucks can be varied, as can the mass of the pucks. The pucks, ranging from 1 to 100\nunits of mass, can be dragged into position ready to be struck by the flippers.\nThe initial velocity of the collision is controlled by directly manipulating the angle of the\nflipper from 90 to 180 degrees in the vertical plane. Before the Go button could be activated,\nsubjects have to qualitatively predict the speed and direction of the pucks after collision. When\nthe Go button is pressed, the pucks move towards each other on the screen, and are animated\nwith a speed proportional to that set by the initial angle of impact executed by the flipper. The\nprogram also highlights the icons with the correct answers after the experiment is run.\nAfter the pucks collide, they move away from each other with a speed which is calculated from\nthe correct physics formalisms. This means that the principles of conservation of momentum\nand kinetic energy are obeyed, and again the apparent screen velocities of the pucks is\nproportional to their calculated values. At the bottom of the screen is a grid which provides\nnumerical information about the amount of energy and momentum that the system had\ninitially, and then, subsequent to being run, it shows what the effect of the collision is on these\ntwo factors. Every experiment attempted by users of the simulation is automatically logged by\nthe computer.\nThe networked version of PuckLand has a communication protocol written in Hypertalk 2\nwhich allows two to eight machines to be simultaneously linked together. With this system you\ncannot continuously see your partner's screen or take control of it, as with other\ncommunication protocols such as Timbuktu. Although screens can be exchanged between the\npartners, this was not an automatic process, since all subjects could choose to accept or reject\ndata from their partner. This latter feature was incorporated into the system to prevent one\npartner, who might have more computer or physics experience than the other, dominating the\nproceedings.\n78\nVolume 4 Number I\nUsing the simulation\nAll subjects had access to their pre-test predictions about the motion of the ice pucks in a\nnumber of given scenarios, during the experimental period. They were explicitly requested to\nwork together as a team while using the simulation, in order to aid their joint understanding of\nelastic collisions. They were given time at the beginning of the session to explore the\nsimulation and to try out any scenarios that interested them. Once the subjects felt they\nunderstood the domain and had exploited the simulation as an information resource, they were\nasked to solve three different problems. These problems required the subjects not to predict the\nresult of a collision but to state the original conditions for a given outcome. The problems were\nposed in order of difficulty and were as follows:\n1. What initial conditions are needed to send the pucks travelling away from each other at\nthe same speed?\n2. What initial conditions are needed to stop one puck after impact?\n3. What initial conditions are needed to make pucks of unequal masses move away, after\nimpact, at the same speed?\nAll subjects were video-recorded throughout the experimental sessions, and the subjects'\ndialogue in the audio condition was tape-recorded on a telephone answering machine. The\nexperiments which were run with the simulation were logged, and the networked version of\nPuckLand also recorded subjects requests to exchange screens. The program finally logged the\nscreens which were accepted or rejected by each partner.\nSubjects\nAll subjects in this study were adults. They held a first degree or equivalent professional\nqualification, and 89% of them had experienced some form of physics education. The mean\nage of the group was 39.9 years (sd = 11.8).\nThe subjects were paired with people they knew and were happy to collaborate with. They\nformed both single-sex and mixed-gender dyads. They were assigned to the side-by-side or\naudio condition depending on which of two test sites they could more easily reach. The\nnumbers in each group are shown in Table 1. However, some of the pairs had worked together\nbefore while others had not. The main factor in determining this relationship was whether\nsubjects were available to participate in the experiment on the same day. We aimed for a\nminimum of 12 subjects in each condition, which was achieved comfortably, but the final\nnumber was determined by the availability of subjects during the experimental period.\nProcedure\nThe subjects were pre-tested with a version of a questionnaire developed by Whitelock et al\n(1993). This included a prediction task where subjects were asked to predict the subsequent\nmotion of two ice pucks after collision for the following five conditions:\nCondition 1: Puck A is small, light and moving; Puck B is larger, heavier and stationary.\nCondition 2: Puck A is large, heavy and moving; Puck B is small, light and stationary.\nCondition 3: Puck A and Puck B are identical in size but only Puck A is moving.\n79\nDenise Whitetock et 0\/ The influence of audio communications technology on computer-supported learning\nSide by side\nSide by side\nSide by side\nAudio\nAudio\nAudio\nSubject group\nMale\nFemale.\nMixed\nMale\nFemale\nMixed\nn\n14\n16\n18\n12\n12\n16\nTable I: Numbers of subjects who worked in\nthe audio-only or side-by-side condition when\nusing the physics simulation\nCondition 4: Puck A is small, light and moving; Puck B is larger, heavier and moving.\nCondition 5: Puck A and Puck B are identical in size and both are moving.\nThe subjects were not only asked about their understanding of kinetic energy and momentum,\nbut also about their expectations of the computer task. In the post-test, all the questions were\nrepeated and some extra information was obtained about the subjects' perceptions of the whole\nexperience.\nResults\nThe key finding from this experiment is that all the pairs did significantly better in the audio\nrather than in the side-by-side condition (see Figure 1). A two-way ANOVA performed on the\npre-post test change scores revealed a significant difference for the communication condition\n(F = 11, p<0.001), but there was no overall difference according to gender.\nAs well as simply looking at improvement on pre- to post-test scores, it was possible to\ninvestigate problem-solving success while subjects were using the simulation (see Figure 2).\nThe three problems were given in order of difficulty and all the pairs were able to solve\nProblem 1. Problem 2 proved to be difficult only for the mixed-gender group in the side-by-\nside condition, while a solution to Problem 3 was more frequently obtained by all groups\nworking in the audio condition. A two-way ANOVA performed on the problem-solving scores\nrevealed a significant difference for the communication condition (F = 15, p<0.001), but there\nwas no overall difference according to gender. There was no significant difference in the\namount of time spent working with the simulation for all the groups tested. Therefore further\nanalysis of the number of experiments performed was undertaken to find reasons for these\ngroup differences.\nAs for the number of experiments performed in each communication condition for each gender\ngroup studied (see Figure 3), the male pairs conducted more experiments in the side-by-side\nthan in the audio condition. The reverse result is true for the female pairs, while subjects of\nmixed gender carried out exactly the same number of experiments regardless of the\ncommunication channel. A two-way ANOVA performed on the number of experiments\nperformed revealed no overall difference according to communication or gender condition.\nWith respect to subjects' management and exchange of experimental information in the audio\n80\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nm.m mixed\nKey: mm = male; ff= female; mixed = mixed gender\nFigure I: Graph to illustrate change scores versus mode of communication and gender mix\nm.m f.f\nGender group\nmixed\nKey: m.m = male; f.f= female; mixed = mixed gender\nFigure 2: Graph to illustrate problem-solving scores versus mode of communication and gender mix\ncondition, only information on 25% of the experiments attempted was transmitted to partners\nduring the session (see Figure 4). From this small number, only four screen-updates were\nrejected. This suggests that the exchange-screen facility was used only when subjects assumed\nit would be mutually beneficial. The videos were consulted to ascertain what sorts of scenario\nprompted partners to send screen-data to one another. Two types of events prompted this\n81\nDen\/se Whitelock et a\\ \"me influence of audio communications technology on computer-supported learning\nKey: m.m = male; f.f= female; mixed = mixed gender\nFigure 3: Graph to illustrate mean number of experiments versus mode of communication and gender\nmix\n350\n T\nPerformed Sent Accepted Rejected\nExperimental interactions between the subjects\nKey: mm = male; f.f= female; mixed = mixed gender\nFigure 4: Graph to illustrate number of experiments exchanged when subjects were working in the\naudio condition only\n82\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\ncourse of action, and these occurred when a partner wanted to help a floundering colleague or\nwhen one of the subjects had a particularly interesting finding to communicate.\nThe main difference between subjects' behaviour during the audio session on the one hand,\nand in the side by side condition on the other is that the 'audio' pairs did not choose to\ncontinually work through everything together. They branched off on their own at times, and\nexplored their individual hunches or hypotheses about what they thought was going on. They\nthen came back together again to discuss their findings. In fact, this was a strategy employed\nby the most successful problem-solvers. An extract from the transcript of one of the male\/male\npairs illustrates this particular modus operandi:\n1. One way of using the resources, as it were, would be if we both played around\nindependently without communicating back too much about it.\n2. And then come back.\n1. Come back and compare notes. All right?\n2. All right.\n1. So we're still trying to create a situation where one of the pucks is stationary after impact;\nall right, are you happy to do that?\n2. Yes I am.\n1. Right, let's pursue a little hunt here and then maintain radio silence.\nThis strategy certainly contributed to subjects in the audio condition solving more problems\nwhile working together online than subjects in the face-to-face condition (see Figure 2).\nHowever, some of the problems were solved not only by students testing hypotheses, but by\nalso adopting a trial-and-error strategy. This latter course of action would also increase the\nnumber of experiments performed with the simulation.\nConclusions\nThe results indicate that with this particular computer-based investigation subjects working in\nthe audio condition were more likely to improve their post-test scores and to succeed in the\nproblem-solving exercises than subjects working side by side. We have found that it is not just\na difference in the number of experiments but in the type of experiments attempted that\ncontributed to joint problem-solving success. These results are also a reflection of how the\nsubjects chose to work together in the different communication conditions. For example, in the\naudio condition, because each subject had his or her own computer, it was possible for\nindividuals to explore their own different hypotheses when their joint deliberations proved\nunsuccessful. We are in the process of analysing the discourse of the pairs of subjects\nthroughout the experimental sessions, and a preliminary pass at the data suggests that co-\noperative construction of shared meaning (Barbieri and Light, 1992) rather than conflict is\nmore important for successful collaboration.\nThis study did not reveal any significant difference in group problem-solving results on\nindividual pre- to post-test change scores with respect to gender, but there was more\nimprovement in the mixed-gender pairs change scores in the audio than in the side-by-side\n83\nDen\/se Wh\/tetock et 0\/ The influence of audio communications technology on computer-supported learning\ncondition. One possible explanation for this is that there was more male dominance when\ncouples were working side by side. However, in the audio condition, both males and females\nwere testing out their own predictions. Our findings suggest gender does not influence learning\nwith this particular computer task but that subjects in certain communication settings benefit\nmore than others. And rather than being an inferior substitute to working side by side, it seems\nthat the audio condition had some advantages.\nThis study forms part of an ongoing research programme, and we will investigate students\nsolving the same physics problems, working at a distance, but this time linked by a video\nconferencing system.\nReferences\nBarbieri, S. and Light P.
