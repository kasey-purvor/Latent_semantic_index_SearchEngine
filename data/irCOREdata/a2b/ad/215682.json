Volunteers intend \nthese networks to be used to reinvigorate local community.  Together these two purposes: \nto engage volunteers in discussing and undertaking technical innovations, and to provide \ninternet access and local community media to urban citizens create two distinct mediated \npublics.  To better address the potential of CWN as a form of local innovation and \ndemocratic rationalization, the relationship between the two publics must be better \nunderstood.  Using a case study of a Canadian CWN, this paper advances the category of \n\u201cpublic\u201d as alternative and complementary to \u201ccommunity\u201d as it is used to describe the \nsocial and technical structures of these projects.  By addressing the tensions between the \ngeek-public of WiFi developers, and the community-public of local people using \ncommunity WiFi networks, this paper revisits questions about the democratic impact of \ncommunity networking projects.  The paper concludes that CWN projects create new \npotential for local community engagement, but that they also have a tendency to reinforce \ngeek-publics more than community-publics, challenging the assumption that community \nnetworks using technology development as a vector for social action necessarily promote \ngreater democracy. \n \n 2 \nKey Words \nCommunity networks \nInternet access \nSocio-technical \nWireless networking \nNew media \nDemocracy \n \nIntroduction \nOn a steamy evening in August 2004, I walked into an organic vegetarian co-op bar to \nmeet Montreal\u2019s community WiFi activists.  Over pitchers of beer, they told me about \ntheir volunteer technology project:  they were setting up free wireless connections to the \ninternet in parks and caf\u00e9s, funded by a small arts grant.  The young men and women I \nmet that night talked about covering the city with WiFi to create an alternative \ncommunications infrastructure based on WiFi hotspots offered free of charge in public \nplaces that anyone could use to access the internet.  They thought this network could also \nprovide a platform for new media art projects. With intelligence and passion, they \ndescribed how the technical flexibility of WiFi would make it possible to create such a \ncommunity-based infrastructure.  They debated ways to organize themselves to solve the \ntechnical and political challenges of this project as a \u201ccommunity\u201d rather than a large \nhierarchical organization.  By 2007, this volunteer organization had built their project into \na network of 150 WiFi hotspots that were used to deliver local information and new \nmedia art.   Meanwhile, WiFi evolved from a little-understood, \u201ckludgy\u201d technology \n 3 \nmore suitable for experimentation than reliable service delivery (Mackenzie, 2003), to a \nmain component of municipal-scale networking projects.  In this context, could these \nactivists succeed in establishing WiFi as infrastructure for more democratic \ncommunications? \n \nWhen I walked into the bar in 2004, theorists and proponents of WiFi had been \ndescribing it as a disruptive technology associated with decentralized, local projects \nundertaken by small-scale organizations: neighbourhoods, community organizations, and \nmunicipal governments (Bar and Galpernin, 2004a, Bar and Galpernin, 2005, Bar and \nGalpernin, 2004b). Like the internet (Abbate, 1999), the cable television system (de la \nSola Pool, 1977), and radio (Douglas, 1987, Haring, 2006)  this interpretation of WiFi \nfocused on its flexibility, its interoperability, and the fact that many innovative \nexperiments with WiFi were emerging from community groups like the one I met in \nMontreal.  The first assessments of these projects (Auray et al., 2003) focused on their \ntechnological choices, and argued that WiFi was particularly appropriate technology for \nsmall-scale, local networking.   \n \nIn the intervening years, Wi-Fi and other wireless technologies have sometimes been \ndescribed as infrastructure for a more democratic digital media landscape (Meinrath, \n2005), but are more often represented as means of providing internet connectivity cheaply \nto broad areas (Lehr et al., 2006).  Large-scale WiFi projects are now being rolled out \nacross North America by municipalities defining WiFi as essential local information and \ncommunication infrastructure (Daggett, 2006).  By November 2007, some of the people I \n 4 \nmet in 2004 presented a partnership project with the city of Montreal that would provide \nsustainable funding and a more conventional organizational structure to support the \nexpansion of their hotspot network onto city-owned property.   \n \nThe transformation of WiFi \nThe transformation of Montreal\u2019s community WiFi from a grassroots project spearheaded \nby a loose volunteer community to a municipal \u201cpublic WiFi\u201d project highlights how \nWiFi projects reestablish the local community as a site for political and social action.  \nThis raises some key questions addressed in this paper.  What is the social and political \nsignificance of community WiFi projects?  Who develops and uses them?  How might \nthey contribute to more democratic communications?  In addition to the social category of \n\u201ccommunity\u201d which can refer both to the \u201cWiFi geeks\u201d who share a common interest in \nhacking and reformulating WiFi technology, and to local residents, the category of \n\u201cpublic\u201d describes how these groups establish shared discourses and practices that can \ninspire what Feenberg and Bakardjieva (2004) refer to as \u201cdemocratic rationalization.\u201d \nDemocratic rationalizations of technology are \u201cuser interventions that challenge harmful \nconsequences, undemocratic power structures, and barriers to communication rooted in \ntechnology\u201d (2004, p. 186).  The political nature of democratic rationalizations suggests \nthat local WiFi projects produce not just \u201cWiFi communities\u201d but \u201cWiFi publics\u201d as well.  \nI argue that these WiFi publics establish shared commitments to social and political ideas \nthrough speech, writing, and technology development.  Many different publics might be \ncreated, but two are discussed here: a geek-public created through speaking, writing and \ncreating WiFi technology, and a community-public constituted through shared \n 5 \nparticipation in a local community that is perceived as being augmented by WiFi \nconnectivity.  \n \nParticipants in a community WiFi projects may be members of one or another public, or \nboth. These overlaps have political implications.  To help describe them, I consider how \nWiFi technology provides the potential for a public to develop recursively:  to create its \nown means of engagement.  After introducing concepts related to WiFi publics, I focus \nmore closely on urban Canadian settings, using Montreal\u2019s community WiFi project to \nfurther explore the tensions and possibilities provoked by ideas of geek and community \npublics, and the concept of recursivity.  I conclude by assessing the potential for WiFi \nprojects \u2013 as community technology and as community media projects \u2013 as vectors for \nsocial and political action in North American urban centres. I offer the paper as a \ncontribution to critical debate concerning the social consequences of community \ntechnology development.  It should interest engaged academics, grassroots technology \nadvocates, and community organizers interested in insights from North America\u2019s WiFi \ntransformation. \n \nMethods: Examining community technology development \nThis paper assumes that technology and society mutually construct one another, and that \ntechnologies are cultural products (Latour, 1996, Latour, 2005, Latour, 1991).  \nIts main themes emerged from a participant observation I conducted from 2004-2007 with \nMontreal\u2019s Ile Sans Fil (\u2018wireless island\u2019) community WiFi network.  As part of this \nresearch I participated in regular volunteer meetings, attended board meetings, supervised \n 6 \na student intern, and contributed to the group mailing list.  Throughout the observation \nperiod, I identified both as an Ile Sans Fil member and as a researcher. The participatory \nnature of this portion of the fieldwork necessarily drew from my own subjective \nexperience of participation, and thus reflects all the benefits and shortcomings of such a \nnecessary subjectivity.  \n \nIn addition to these observations, I conduced two sets of in-depth, semi-structured \ninterviews with ten core members of Ile Sans Fil, one in 2004 and one in 2007.  To gain a \nbroader Canadian context, I conducted structured, hour-long interviews with leaders of \nfour Canadian Community WiFi networks in June 2006. I also conducted two surveys of \nthe users of the network: in 2004 and in 2006.i  The 2004 survey was conducted by hand-\ndistributing printed questionnaires to hotspots.  It received 56 responses, primarily from \nvolunteers.  The 2006 survey was conducted online, advertised on and linked to the portal \npage visible at each hotspot.   It ran from January to April 2006 and received 370 \nresponses, providing a better general description of the wider community that uses ISF \nhotspots. To explore more subjective aspects of the use of the ISF service I conducted 15 \nminute structured interviews with users of the ISF system:  eight in 2005 and, as part of a \nlarger research project, twelve in 2007,ii when I also interviewed three members of \ncommunity organizations and research groups who collaborated with Ile Sans Fil, \nincluding some of the architects of the municipal partnership.  \n \nI transcribed field notes and interviews, and analyzed the resulting text documents using \nthe NVivo 7 qualitative software.  My coding and analysis concentrated on how ideas of \n 7 \ncommunity and technology were interrelated in the discourse and practice of community \nWiFi groups. Survey data was used for descriptive statistics and to guide user interviews.  \nThis analytic approach produced multiple contexts (Hammersly and Atkinson, 1995) and \nsituated perspectives on how WiFi (and, by extension, other communication \ntechnologies) is imagined, designed, built, used, and contested  (Law, 2002, Miller and \nSlater, 2001, Suchman, 1987) for other examples of similar approaches).   This approach \ndraws from an interpretive epistemology (Guba and Lincoln, 1989) that is grounded in a \ndesire to contextualize the \u201cways of others\u201d in discourse (Balka, 2007).  As Clark (2004) \nnotes, framing stories are important in contextualizing the multiplicity of perspectives \nencountered in producing any kind of knowledge.  This paper provides such a framing \nstory for the development of community WiFi in Canada, one that benefits from a deep \nand sustained engagement with this process.  \n \nNew Concepts of Geeks, Communities, and Publics \nPhilosopher Charles Taylor (2002) defines a \u201csocial imaginary\u201d as \u201cways in which people \nimagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on \nbetween them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the deeper \nnormative notions and images that underlie these expectations\u201d (p. 106).  Unique social \nimaginaries, Taylor argues, emerge out of particular moments of history.  In \ncontemporary society, social imaginaries are constituted or reinforced through the process \nof communication.  Both communities and publics are forms of social imaginary.  In the \nfollowing section I distinguish the expansive, politicized conception of a public from the \nmore contained, affective concept of community, and introduce WiFi geeks as key actors \n 8 \nin creating community WiFi.  I then create two hybrid categories that permit me to assess \ncommunity WiFi projects:  geek-publics and community-publics. \n \nCommunities \nAnderson (1991) argues that communities are imagined by their members and that they \ncan be constituted around forms of media like newspapers, maps, or even monuments.   \nThe concept of community seems to have a naturally bounded character, even when it is \nimagined as transcending the geographic and cultural constraints that characterized the \nfirst social scientific definitions of community. T\u00f6nnies (1887, trans. 1955) defined \ncommunity (gemeinschaft) as a \u201cunity of will\u201d in opposition to society (geschellschaft).  \nThis traditional sociological definition takes village and family as primary sites for \ndevelopment of community, and even though social research now concentrates on a \nprofusion of types of community including \u201cgeographic communities, virtual \ncommunities, communities of circumstance that grow from situations of need, and \ncommunities of interest\u201d (Fraser, 2005).  Substantial research literatures have discussed \nthe potential of distributed, internet-based virtual communities as potential sites for \ntranscending or ameliorating urban public space or local community (Bell, 2001, \nWellman and Gulia, 1999).  Within the domain of community networking (CN) or \ncommunity informatics (CI), research on facilitating interaction within these online \ncommunities has emerged alongside a social justice analysis of the impacts of ICT \ndevelopment and use in local communities (Stoecker, 2005). Gurstein (2000) defines \ncommunity informatics as \u201cthe application of information and communication \ntechnologies (ICT) to enable community processes and the achievement of community \n 9 \nobjectives including overcoming \u2018digital divides\u2019 both within and among communities\u201d \n(cited in Marshall et al., 2004 p. 3). I shall use CN and CI interchangeably in this paper. \n \nAs a way of integrating virtual and local communities, WiFi hacking envisions a potential \nspace of non-commercial control, grassroots restructuring, and citizen participation in \ncommunications. As Mackenzie (2005) writes: \nThe constant appearance of new gadgets, devices, and practices that \nmodify, alter, or hybridize Wi-Fi suggests that hopes for other forms of \nsociality and openness associated with communication technology still \npersist. That hopefulness is conditioned by the recent history of new \nmedia, particularly by a consciousness of the almost total commercial \nownership and control of Internet and communications infrastructure (p. \n207).   \n \nThis situates community WiFi projects somewhat problematically within a larger \ntrajectory of CN and CI endeavors.  The first WiFi communities focused on explicitly \ntechnical goals, putting energy into hacking rather than addressing social or policy issues.  \nSandvig (2004) argues that these early WiFi communities failed to challenge the \ndominant political-economic structures of internet provision.  A second wave of WiFi \ncommunities (called community wireless networks or CWNs) described by Meinrath \n(2005), Powell and Shade (2006) and Cho (2006) developed a discourse and practice that \ncontextualized WiFi as communication infrastructure built by and for citizens.  Like \n 10 \nprevious community networks, these projects hope to mobilize ICTs to create social and \neconomic development in local geographical communities (Schuler, 1996).  \n \nO\u2019Neil (2002) argues that the values of   (1) \u201cstrong\u201d democracy, (2) social capital, (3) \nindividual empowerment, (4) sense of community, and (5) opportunities for economic \ndevelopment should characterize CN initiatives. Wal Taylor (2004) writes, \u201cCI is based \non the assumption that geographically-based communities (also known as \u2018physical\u2019 or \n\u2018geo-local\u2019 communities) have characteristics, requirements, and opportunities that \nrequire different strategies for ICT intervention and development from the widely \naccepted implied models of individual or in-home computer\/internet access\u201d (p. 4).  In the \npast, these strategies included integrating computing and information tools into the local \ncommunity at neighbourhood centres, libraries, or language schools (Clement and Shade, \n2000) so that they could be used to access the internet and build skills.  Community WiFi \nnetworking encompasses a similar broad range of goals, with \u201cmore connectivity, better \nspeeds, and a lower cost\u201d cited by advocates as reasons for creating a community wireless \nnetwork (Flickenger, 2003 p. 4).  \n \nWiFi communities (like some older CNs) are also closely connected to free and open-\nsource software development, and to the \u201chacker ethic\u201d of technical experimentation \ndescribed by Levy (1984).  Non-hierarchical, action-oriented, and meritocratic, this \nculture valorizes decentralization, \u201cconspicuous contribution\u201d and argument-by-\ntechnology.  This culture and its values suggest that members of WiFi communities also \nform WiFi publics.   \n 11 \n \nPublics \nPublics are socio-political entities self-organized through discourse.  Charles Taylor \n(2002) and Michael Warner (2002) argue that publics are formed through discourse \u2013 \nspeech and writing - that reflects  the \u201cways in which people imagine their social \nexistence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their \nfellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and \nimages that underlie these expectations\u201d (Taylor, 2002 p. 106). Warner understands this \nexchange of discourse as being the site of pure political engagement, outside of the \nframework of the state: \u201cspeaking, writing, and thinking involve us\u2014actively and \nimmediately\u2014in a public, and thus in the being of the sovereign\u201d (Warner 2002a, p. 51\u2013\n52).  Speaking, writing, and thinking are the foundations of sovereignty, and the creation \nand use of media to communicate them is politically important. \n \nEvery form of media has its public:  readers of newspapers, viewers of debates, \nparticipants in political rallies or commentators on blogs.   However, most publics do not \nnormally focus their engagement on debating the very structures through which they \nspeak or write.  Kelty (2005) argues that the Internet has permitted the development of a \nspecific public composed of \u201cgeeks\u201d: \u201ctechnically competent individuals concerned with \nand engaged in defining, developing, and debating the technical and legal structures of \nthe Internet and other computer networks\u201d (Kelty, 2005 p. 185).  Community networking \nliterature might describe geeks as a community of practice.  However, Kelty argues that \nthey are a public because their interest in discussing the structure and standards of the \n 12 \nInternet has political importance, as well as importance for sustaining the geek public. He \nargues that geeks create a recursive public  -- \u201ca particular form of social imaginary \nthrough which this group imagines in common the means of their own association, the \nmaterial forms this imagination takes, and what place it has in the contemporary \ndevelopment of the Internet\u201d (p. 186).  Kelty\u2019s recursive geek public communicates using \nthe internet while also constructing the communicative space of the internet, extending \n\u201cthe activities of \u2018speaking writing, and thinking\u2019 which have defined [publics] \nclassically, to include building, coding, compiling, patching, hacking, redistributing, and \nsharing\u201d (2005 p. 203).  These activities make  \u201cargument-by-technology\u201d that \nsupplements the \u201cargument-by-talk\u201d that characterizes other mediated public speech.   \nThrough these activities, geeks are potentially engaged in a democratic rationalization of \nthe Internet, using their own debates and coding practices to retain the space in which \nthey can relate to one another. \n \nLocal WiFi geeks are distinct from Internet geeks.  First, WiFi geeks are not a \ndemographically broad group: most \u2013 though not all -- of the geeks I describe in this \npaper are white men, under 40, with post-secondary education. Second, unlike Internet \ngeeks whose primary concern is the structure of the Internet, these WiFi geeks are \ninterested in developing wireless technologies that not only connect to the Internet but \nalso create local networks that can be used as forms of community media.  Thus in \naddition to creating a geek-public constituted through argument-by-talk and argument-by-\ntechnology, WiFi geeks potentially also create a unique media platform for an even \nbroader public composed of the people living in the area covered by WiFi.  The actions of \n 13 \nWiFi geeks in Canada suggest an interest in using WiFi to serving this community-public: \nvolunteer associations of WiFi geeks have developed, creating collaborations between \nartists and members of community organizations, as well as other forms of civic \nengagement. This draws the community WiFi project close to previous CN projects and \ndemocratic rationalizations that have leveraged information and communication \ntechnologies to inspire change in local community-publics by providing more just and \nequal access to the means of communication (Feenberg and Bakardjieva, 2002).  The \nexpanded access to the Internet and to local information through public WiFi promises a \nsimilar democratic rationalization.   The hope is that through decentralized, inexpensive \ninfrastructure installed by community members, the community-public can develop and \ncirculate new discourses. \n \nStill, there are some potential tensions between geek-publics and community-publics.  \nWarner (2002) argues that publics are created through discourse, through the ability to \nspeak, read, or write to others who share the same social imaginary. As a form of \ncommunity media, WiFi can be used to share writing, speech, and other forms of \nmediated communications, but argument-by-technology requires more technical expertise \nthan argument-by speech.  The following sections distinguish between the publics \nmobilized by WiFi. \nConceptualizing WiFi Publics  \nTable 1 details the differences between the \u201cgeek-public\u201d and the \u201ccommunity-public.\u201d   \nEach is created through discourses and practices that define shared identities such as \n\u201cgeek,\u201d neighborhood resident, parent, or citizen.  Both publics can be created through \n 14 \ndifferent types of community WiFi activities:  the geek-public is brought together by \norganizing a \u201cgeek group\u201d and talking about the importance of geeky activities, and the \ncommunity-public could be mobilized by greater access to media that communicates local \nissues.  A WiFi network is often perceived as being a way to augment or improve local \ncommunities by expanding access to the internet, and through the development of a new \ncommunity media source built and managed by the community itself.  \n(TABLE 1 HERE) \n \nThe geek-public and the community-public can overlap.  WiFi geeks building local \nnetworks are part of their local community; working to create networks they hope will be \nuseful to their community.  One way of assessing the distinctions between community-\npublics and geek-publics is to consider how each uses WiFi recursively.  A recursive \npublic develops when a public\u2019s speaking, writing, or coding produces the means by \nwhich that public\u2019s engagement is made possible.  For geek-publics, this occurs when the \npublic discusses and creates the technologies that help geeks define themselves as such.  \nKelty (2005) demonstrates how Internet geeks create Internet\u2019s rules and standards, and \nthen use these rules and standards as subjects for discussions online. WiFi geeks also \nrecursively create their own means of engagement by debating and creating modifications \nto WiFi standards and to WiFi hardware and software.  More fundamentally, though, both \nInternet and WiFi geeks create recursive publics by using arguments about (and by) \ntechnology as means of making social links.  WiFi hacking makes better WiFi tools that \ncan better connect geeks to each other, but hacking is also a means of making a WiFi \ngroup, and defining a WiFi geek. \n 15 \n \nIn a democratic rationalization of WiFi technology, we would expect the community-\npublic to also develop recursively.  A recursive community-public could develop a shared \nsense of belonging to a local space by contributing to the media platforms that reflect its \nmembers shared identity.  Ideally, WiFi hotspots like those developed by Canadian \nCWNs play this role by providing local information and displaying artistic projects that \ntake advantage of the local reach of WiFi.  WiFi hotspots are imagined as being able to \ndeliver extremely targeted local information:  for example displaying the results of recent \nlocal council votes and filtering information based on the location of the hotspot and the \ninterests of its visitors.  A platform like this could provide a way for the community-\npublic to develop in the spaces of WiFi hotspots, drawing on the capacity for WiFi to \noperate as a form of community media.  \n(TABLE 2 HERE) \n \nCase studies: Canadian WiFi projects and Montreal\u2019s Ile Sans Fil \nCanadian community WiFi projects present a unique case demonstrating the tensions \nbetween geek publics and community publics. Canada\u2019s early policy focus on broadband \nprovision for all citizensiii, has prevented a municipal WiFi explosion like the one the \nUnited States experienced. While Canada\u2019s universal broadband programs were not \nentirely successful in providing broadband service in all areas (many rural and remote \nareas are still without broadband access) they have provided very good broadband \nconnectivity at reasonable prices to subscribers in most Canadian cities. Canadian CWNs \nin cities like Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver have therefore focused on \n 16 \nexperimentation with WiFi\u2019s technical, social, and policy representations, drawing from \ntheir specific social context, as well as contributing to it.  For example, in Canada\u2019s \nlargest city Toronto, WirelessToronto contributes to a culture of social innovation:  it is a \nvirtual tenant of the nonprofit Centre for Social Innovation, the site of its first hotspot and \na partner on grant applications.  The centre rents space to social mission organizations, \nand offers seminars on technology, and social enterprise to which members of WT \ncontribute.  In another example, on the West Coast in Vancouver, the British Columbia \nWireless Networking Society engages with a charged political landscape by directing its \nactivities to bridging the digital divide between Vancouver\u2019s urban areas and the rural \nislands nearby and submitting briefs to decision-makers on community technology issues. \nIn Montreal, Ile San Fil\u2019s efforts resonate with a culture of community action and \ngrassroots projects.  The city has a long tradition of grassroots organizing and mutual aid, \nextending back to the organizing efforts of the Catholic religious colonists.  More \nrecently, decades of Quebec leftist governments have solidified in citizens the concept of \na \u201cshared good\u201d and a connection between radical politics and community media (Raboy, \n1984).  Community action is sometimes associated with self-determination of French-\nspeaking Quebec.  The following section examines how Ile Sans Fil (ISF) draws on these \ninfluences in its construction of geek-publics and community-publics through the \ndevelopment of WiFi networks. \n \n \n \n \n 17 \nExamining CWN complexities:  Ile Sans Fil \nVolunteers as a Geek-public \nThe vision of ISF has been to \u201cuse new technology, especially wireless technology, to \nempower individuals and to foster a sense of community\u201d (Ile Sans Fil, 2003)iv.  To put \nthis vision into practice its members have engaged in four main activities:  building \nsoftware, installing network nodes, building relationships with other community \norganizations, and creating and managing art and media content to be displayed at its \nhotspots.  ISF members believed that these activities should be organized non-\nhierarchically, and decisions made by consensus \u2013 as within other open-source \nmobilizations.  These organizational elements, combining argument-by-technology and \nargument-by-talk, helped to create a geek-public of experts from its volunteers. \n \nVolunteers at ISF are students, professionals, or retired.  Most speak both French and \nEnglish fluently.  Since 2003, there have been over 100 volunteers involved for various \nlengths of time.  Individual volunteers express different kinds of interest in WiFi:  for \nexample, some consider it a medium for artistic interventions while for others it is a \npractical service lacking in Montreal or a platform for community media. Yet all \nvolunteers described ISF as \u201cgeeky.\u201d  One female ISF member described herself almost \napologetically as \u201clacking any geeky skills\u201d  (Female Ile Sans Fil volunteer, Interview \nFeb. 12, 2005) although she was a multimedia artist and curator comfortable both with \nprogramming software and with modifying computer hardware as part of her work.  \nAnother volunteer described ISF as \u201cprimarily a social club for geeks . . .  a club of \npassionate workersv\u201d (Interview with Laurent Maisonnave, December 8, 2007). Most ISF \n 18 \nmembers also said that one of their main reasons to participate in ISF was to contribute to \ntheir community.  Many meetings finished with members introducing themselves and \nchatting, saying things like \u201cwe are really a nice bunch of people \u2013 we are the good \nonesvi\u201d (Field Notes, March 21, 2006).  The volunteer interviewed above said that groups \nlike ISF were important because \u201cthey provide access to something that\u2019s important, like \nwater, electricity [smiles] . . . well it\u2019s not more important, but it lets you get informedvii\u201d \n(Interview with Laurent Maisonnave, December 8, 2007). \n \nActivities:  Building Public WiFi Access, Augmenting local community \nISF has focused on installing WiFi in locations that are open to the public (though not, \nstrictly speaking, public) including parks, caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants, artist and community \ncentres, and the public areas of some hospitals and academic institutions.   Backhaul \nbandwidth is provided by the organization where the hotspot is located.  Many ISF \nhotspots were originally installed in locations that volunteers regularly visited. Members \nare encouraged to \u201cadopt\u201d a hotspot by visiting it and assuring its functionality, and \npublic ISF meetings are held every two weeks in one of the hotspots, where members test \nthe network connection while holding discussions and drinking beer.   Drinking beer, and \nsocializing in general, plays an important part in the culture of ISF volunteers.  \nMembership in the group offers them a chance to gather in a \u201cthird space\u201d away from \nwork and home (Oldenburg, 1989) and get to know others with similar interests. \n \nThe idea of using WiFi networks to support electronic \u201cthird spaces\u201d was part of ISF\u2019s \nvision.  Many volunteers said that one goal of  ISF should be \u201cget people out of their \n 19 \nbasements\u201d  (Field Notes, 2004; 2005; 2006)  - in other words, it should establish WiFi \nconnectivity as a way of encouraging geeks and other people who might be working in \npublic spaces to get to know each other.  This goal has influenced ISF\u2019s software project. \n\u201cWiFiDog\u201d is open-source software that transforms off-the-shelf WiFi modems into \nnodes in the group\u2019s network, each of which displays a unique opening page (\u201cthe portal \npage\u201d).  The software also helps to manage images and content to be displayed on this \nopening page.  WiFiDog has become a standard piece of software for WiFi hotspot \nnetworks -- both commercial and community-based. WiFiDog was created to facilitate a \nunique, WiFi-delivered media environment at each hotspot.  Its designers added a \nnetwork-wide news feed, linked to photo-sharing site Flickr so that photos tagged with \nthe hotspot name would automatically be displayed, and also attempted to build a music-\nsharing system where hotspots provided libraries of music chosen to fit their specific \nculture.  To promote social interaction between people using the same hotspot, the \nopening page for each hotspot displays a list of all of the users who are logged in, with \nlinks to profiles showing their website, name, or other information.   These projects were \nexplicit interventions that attempted to establish WiFi hotspots as unique social and \ncultural spaces where WiFi could create a missing \u201cthird space\u201d for public social \ninteraction.  The idea that WiFi connections in cafes could bring isolated people together \nresonates with the goals of community networking projects, in that it connects an interest \nin inspiring virtual communities with a focus on development and use of ICTS for local \nsocial and economic development.  In these plans at least, democratic rationalization \nseems possible. \n \n 20 \nHacking as a form of social engagement \n \nISF\u2019s activities add a new cultural element to community networking.  The image of \nyouthful, volunteer geeks installing their own software as a contribution to their \ncommunity casts a friendly, trendy image over computer networking.  Reframing hacking \nas legitimate form of social engagement establishes geeks as a potentially powerful \ncategory of social and cultural actors. One of the ISF founders writes,  \nWe are hacking the built city.  This statement is based on the idea that as wireless \ndevices and services proliferate and ubiquitous computing becomes a reality, the \nphysical environment (especially the built city) is rapidly becoming enhanced \nspace or mixed-reality. The supposedly separate existences of off-line and on-line \nare intersecting and overlapping - most rapidly in cities. (Lenczner, 2005)   \n \nThis argument connects virtual communities \u2013 or geek-publics - with local place-based \ncommunity-publics, establishing hacking as a means of altering public life by \ntransforming technology. For ISF members and other geeks who use WiFi hacking as a \nmeans to get to know each other and contribute to their city, \u201chacking the city\u201d provides a \nnew way of engaging with civic life, even as it helps develop a recursive geek-public.  \nHowever, hacking may not have the same influence on the non-geeks in the community-\npublic.  \n 21 \n \n \n \nGeek-publics and Community-publics \n \nWarner (2002) argues that a public must continually extend its discourse to \u201cindefinite \nstrangers\u201d outside of the centre of its discourse production if it is to be sustained: \notherwise, the would-be public remains a closed group.  ISF attempts to extend its \ndiscourse as well as its WiFi networks by maintaining partnerships with artists and \ncommunity organizations to develop content for the portal page, and by appealing to the \npeople who use WiFi hotspots, the \u201cindefinite strangers\u201d (Warner, 2002 p. 120) who are \nmeant to be creating media and socializing through the portal pages.  However, the design \nand management of the physical network has been more successful than the mobilization \nof the community-public.  A former member of the administrative council of ISF reflects: \n\u201cIt\u2019s as if we reproduced a production line [for the deployment of WiFi hotspots] - we \nreproduced an industrial model . . . . But it could have been a noble project . . . In this \nthere was a problem of governance, the problem was that the people with the artistic \nprojects were always outsidersviii\u201d (Daniel Lemay, interview Dec. 6, 2007).  A \ncollaborator at a university arts project echoed this reflection on the challenges of \ncollaboration with ISF, and the group\u2019s distributed organizational structure: \nIt\u2019s a bit challenging because it\u2019s [a], purposefully distributed control structure out \nthere which is . . . great for some things and sort of difficult if you are on a \nproduction timeline and you are not sort of really within the inner circle.  So you \n 22 \ndon\u2019t . . . know all the people and you don\u2019t know who you have to go to to get \nwhat done.  (Anonymous, interview July 17, 2007) \n \nThe recursive nature of ISF, where discussions about and experimentation with WiFi \nhelped geeks to define a \u201cgeek-public\u201d also complicated the development of the \ncollaborations that helped make their project relevant to a broader community-public that \nincluded the users of WiFi hotspots. \n \nNew publics: Using the Ile Sans Fil network \nOver 40,000 people are registered as users of the ISF network.  Survey data from 2006 \nsuggests that the \u201cusers\u201d are not far different from the \u201cgeeks\u201d: forty-eight per cent are \naged twenty-five to thirty-four, and sixty-seven per cent have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, \nand higher proportions worked in education, media, and telecommunications than in other \nfields.  Sixty-eight per cent said that they used Wi-Fi hotspots \u201cto get out of my home or \noffice.\u201d  Although the availability of WiFi influenced which caf\u00e9s and bars respondents \nvisited, many also reported that they used free WiFi wherever it was available, not \nnecessarily only at ISF hotspots.   \n \nObservations and interviews conducted in November 2005 and May 2007 with people \nusing ISF hotspots support these insights from the survey.  They indicate that while the \ndiscourse of \u201ccommunity\u201d is important to users, some user practices oppose ISF\u2019s social \ngoals.  ISF users primarily want to gain access to the internet freely \u2013 one user described \nhimself as \u201copportunistic \u2013 but aren\u2019t we all? (Male Ile Sans Fil user, interview Nov 5, \n 23 \n2005).\u201d  These opportunistic users were more interested in connectivity to the internet \nthan in socializing with people sitting nearby in a caf\u00e9. In addition, many of the people I \ninterviewed preferred accessing WiFi networks anonymously, and were annoyed with \nISF\u2019s authentication procedures.  The fact that the service was \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 as in, free of \ncharge \u2013 was considered more important than the fact that ISF\u2019s technical and social \nstructure were open to participation:  while the network users I interviewed knew that ISF \nwas a community organization, none of them had attended meetings, although one \nrespondent said that he had \u201cgiven them [ISF] my opinion on a couple of things, but they \nalways ignored me\u201d (Male Ile Sans Fil user, interview Nov 5, 2005).  For the broader \ncommunity of users, ISF\u2019s projects were \u201ca good idea that should be replicated \nelsewhere\u201d (Female Ile Sans Fil user, interview November 10, 2005) but not something \nthat inspired profound connection to the local community. This suggests that members of \nthe non-geek community-public in Montreal are not necessarily interested in using \ntechnology as a means of creating social links \u2013 or at least not in the recursive manner \nthat ISF\u2019s geeks might have expected. \n \nThe use of the ISF portal page suggests that there is an important difference between the \nrecursive geek-public brought together by designing and using the WiFiDog software and \nthe (still imaginary?) recursive community-public that has so far failed to use the portal \npage as a platform for social interactions.  According to interviewees, viewing local \ncontent on the portal pages is perceived as a necessary impediment to connecting to the \ninternet to send email or surf the web.  Most users interviewed said that they did not use \nprofiles, and some were opposed to the idea of putting personal information online where \n 24 \nit would be visible to strangers.  One person explained that he used the number of user \nnames appearing on a hotspot\u2019s portal page as a gauge for the amount of bandwidth \navailable, avoiding locations with too many people online (Male Ile Sans Fil user, 2005). \nISF users seemed more interested in getting free WiFi than in participating in a mediated \nversion of caf\u00e9 society.  Like Habermas\u2019 (1989) bourgeois public sphere composed of \nmen encountering one another in caf\u00e9s, the recursive geek public in Montreal reinforces \nits own social connections in public spaces:  the hotspot with the highest number of \nvisitors between 2004 and 2007 (now closed) catered to mobile workers, and on most \ndays at least one ISF member could be found working there.  While the geeks are in the \ncafes, the users may be elsewhere: Crow et al. (2007) suggest that a significant number of \nIle Sans Fil users are accessing the internet from adjacent office buildings, restaurants, or \nhomes rather than the publicly accessible hotspots. This means that ISF\u2019s plans to use \nWiFi to augment an experience of physical space have been undermined by WiFi\u2019s own \ntechnical structure:  it passes easily through walls and windows.   \n \nDemocratic Rationalization:  Limitations and  Possibilities \nDespite hopes that ISF\u2019s delivery of free WiFi could inspire Montreal\u2019s community-\npublic to contribute to new forms of community media, ISF\u2019s most significant social \nconsequence may be the development of the geek-public.  Economically, ISF has virtually \neliminated the market for pay-for-use WiFi in public spaces in Montreal.  In the words of \none of its founding members, \u201cwe have done a great job of domesticating free WiFi in \nMontreal\u201d (Michael Lenczner, personal communication November 17, 2007).   As WiFi \ntechnology becomes more widely diffused, the geeks who first explored and developed \n 25 \nthe technology begin to be considered experts. This process can be compared to the \ndevelopment of \u201celectrician\u201d as a profession in the early period of electrification.  Marvin \n(1988) describes how discourses of expertise helped electricians to establish the \nlegitimacy of their new profession.  Similarly, geeks may be legitimating their own \nexpertise in WiFi networking through the development of recursive geek-publics.  \nDespite an admirable commitment to ameliorating a broad local community, CWNs may \nprimarily build social capital for their members (Cho, 2006).  Considering that the \ncommunity-public has yet to use ISF portal pages to engage in recursive discussions \nabout each hotspot\u2019s community, the legacy of community WiFi networking may be in \nmobilizing geeks, and in discouraging consumers from paying for WiFi. \n \nNonetheless the expertise of WiFi geek-publics may be maintained by emerging \norganizational structures.  In November 2007 I spoke with one of the members of the city \nof Montreal\u2019s municipal economic development office about their proposed partnership \nwith ISF.  He referred to ISF complimentarily as \u201ca group of geeks\u201d \u2013 and felt that the \npartnership structure should support, not replace, what he saw as a fragile organizational \nform that was unique to Montreal (Bill Tierney, personal communication Nov. 18, 2007).  \nThe city of Montreal\u2019s initial interest in the ISF project came in response to local mass \nmedia\u2019s enthusiastic coverage of the project.  Between 2004 and 2007 thirty-eight \narticles, most in the dominant French-language press, discussed ISF.  Many of them \nidentified ISF\u2019s community innovation as an important part of the city\u2019s identity.  \nSupporting the further development of this innovative group would thus reinforce this \npositive image of the Montreal community.  The proposed partnership between ISF and \n 26 \nthe city of Montreal will not create a ubiquitous broadband network.  Instead, it will \nprovide funding for a full-time employee to manage ISF\u2019s volunteers, in return for an \nexpansion of the network to 400 hotspots, some of them in city parks and public squares.  \nBy attempting to gently institutionalize rather than replace the ISF network, the city of \nMontreal is supporting the further development of the geek-public. The community-\npublic will presumably be served through expanded availability of WiFi in public places \nincluding city parks.  Still, this project aims primarily to provide better options for \noccasional use of WiFi rather than provide a municipal WiFi infrastructure. \n \nConclusion \nIn the broader context of community networking and community informatics projects, the \nactivities of ISF indicate that building WiFi can be an activity that creates and reinforces \nnew categories of social actors:  WiFi publics.   \nThe energy I felt in 2004 upon first meeting Montr\u00e9al\u2019s WiFi geeks convinced me that \nthis group could redefine local culture and communications, making them more \ndemocratic. The social goals espoused by these projects demonstrate that new \ncommunication technologies can be developed outside of institutional channels, and in \nways that foreground social and cultural contributions.   In the broader North American \ncontext, yearly meetings of WiFi activists have focused on the broader political \nimplications of WiFi, particularly the political necessity for local control of \ncommunications infrastructure.  While these meetings introduce WiFi geeks to new \npotential roles as policy experts, they also highlight the local specificity of community \n 27 \nWiFi projects.  These local variations may keep WiFi projects relevant to the democratic \nlife of local communities.  Worldwide, local iterations of WiFi projects created by \ncommunity organizations impact rural and urban communities (Powell and Meinrath, \nforthcoming).  As Dean (2002) argues, mass politics and mass publics may be waning as \nsites of political influence.  While Dean advocates the creation of \u201cissue networks\u201d to \nconnect people together, the community WiFi phenomenon provides another example of \nhow the community can become a site of creative engagement with media and \ninformation infrastructures. \n \nHowever, this development of a broader \u201cWiFi movement\u201d and local projects like ISF is \nstill marked by incongruities between geek publics and community publics.  In light of \nincreased corporate control of telecommunications infrastructure and the paucity of \ncommunity media developed for new media platforms, an important role remains for \ncommunity WiFi projects where knowledgeable geek-publics develop community-based \ncommunications infrastructure.  Nevertheless, at the local community level and within \nbroader advocacy projects, the potential for community technology to benefit a broad \ncommunity-public must be balanced against its tendency to primarily mobilize a recursive \ngeek-public, or as has occurred in Montreal, to appeal to a supposedly \u201cbroader\u201d public \nthat is demographically very similar to the geek-public.  Warner (2002) notes that to \nsurvive, publics must expand \u2013 otherwise, their discourse turns inward. The strong \nrecursive tendency of geek-publics suggests that this may be a risk for community WiFi \nprojects.  While this seems to be occurring at Ile Sans Fil, the project has had impacts \noutside the Montreal community:  it has inspired not only WirelessToronto but also two \n 28 \nother WiFi projects in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, both of which have established funding \nand partnerships that formalize relationships between geek volunteers, local governments \nand cultural producers.  \n \nCommunity wireless networks are part of a new generation of projects that politicize \ncommunication technology, creating a potential democratic rationalization of WiFi \nnetworking. However, if this democratic rationalization is to fulfill its promise, WiFi \npublics must create and distribute discourses and practices that mobilize not just geek-\npublics but community-publics too.  They must also create different kinds of \ncollaborations to prevent new kinds of divides from forming between educated, \nprofessional users of WiFi and other people in the local community.  These could be \ncollaborations between local governments and geeks, like the one beginning in Montreal, \nor community-based media projects using WiFi and other mobile technologies.  As \ncomplex as the internal relationships may become, policy-makers and community \norganizers should attempt to leave space for visionaries, idealists, artists and geeks to \nthink, talk, and hack their way into new publics. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 29 \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was supported by the Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation \nand Networking (CRACIN) and by the Laboratoire de Communication M\u00e9diatis\u00e9e par \nOrdinateur at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montreal, both funded by the Social Sciences \nand Humanities Research Council.
