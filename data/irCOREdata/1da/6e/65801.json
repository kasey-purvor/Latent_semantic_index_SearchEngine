Emerin has also been shown to interact with pro-\nteins that are principally found at the outer nuclear membrane \n(ONM), namely nesprin 1\u03b1 (Mislow et al., 2002) and nesprin 2 \n(Zhang et al., 2005). Emerin was identified by positional \n candidate cloning as the gene responsible for the X-linked \nform of Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) (Bione \net al., 1994). The autosomal-dominant form of the disease is \ncaused by mutations in the gene LMNA, which encodes lamins \nA and C (Bonne et al., 1999). Two hypotheses have been for-\nmulated to explain why ubiquitously expressed proteins such \nas emerin, lamin A, and lamin C should cause such highly \ntissue-specifi c diseases. These are referred to as the \u201cstructural\u201d \nand the \u201cgene expression\u201d hypotheses. The gene expression \nhypothesis proposes that emerin and lamins are involved in \ntissue-specifi c gene expression and disease may arise from the \ndownstream effects of mutations on chromatin structure or \ngene expression (Cohen et al., 2001). The structural hypothesis \nproposes that emerin and lamins contribute to the structural \nintegrity of the cell by acting as a load-bearing center under-\nneath the nuclear envelope (NE) (Hutchison, 2002). In this hypo-\nthesis, absence of emerin or lamins in disease would render \ncontractile cells like skeletal and cardiac muscle vulnerable to \ndamage, leading to cell death and tissue damage (Hutchison \net al., 2001).\nSupporting the structural hypothesis, there is accumulating \nevidence that the NE is closely linked and connected to its \nsurrounding cytoskeleton. Work on two protein families, the \nnesprins and Sun proteins, reveals the existence of \u201cbridging\u201d \ncomplexes, referred to as the LINC complexes, which span \nthe NE, thus connecting, the INM with the actin cytoskeleton \n(Crisp et al., 2006). A recent study showed that disorganiza-\ntion of the actin, vimentin, and tubulin cytoskeletons arose as \na consequence of the absence of lamins A and C in mouse em-\nbryonic fi broblasts (Broers et al., 2004), directly supporting the \nidea that the NE is a load-bearing center in animal cells. Here, \nwe investigate how absence of emerin in human fi broblasts \naffects cytoskeleton organization. We show that emerin inter-\nacts with \u03b2-tubulin to anchor the centrosome at the ONM. This \nunexpected fi nding provides further support for the structural \nhypothesis and provides the fi rst clue as to how the tubulin cyto-\nskeleton is connected to the NE.\nA novel role for the nuclear membrane protein \nemerin in association of the centrosome to the outer \nnuclear membrane\nGeorgia Salpingidou,1 Andrei Smertenko,1 Irena Hausmanowa-Petrucewicz,2 Patrick J.

To this end, human \ndermal fi broblasts (HDF) from healthy individuals and from \nX-EDMD patients (which were null for emerin) were investigated \nfor possible abnormalities in the actin, vimentin, and tubulin \ncytoskeleton (Fig. 1). In stark contrast to fi ndings in lamin A\/C-\nnull mouse embryonic fi broblasts, there were little or no differ-\nences in the organization of any of the cytoskeletal elements in \nemerin-null HDFs. Surprisingly, however, we did observe that \nthe centrosome was not positioned next to the nucleus in emerin-\nnull HDFs (Fig. 1, arrowheads).\nTo confi rm this fi nding, we used an antibody against peri-\ncentrin to specifi cally investigate the position of the centrosome. \nIn normal HDF the centrosome was positioned next to or within \n1.5 \u03bcm of the NE. In contrast, in four independent emerin-null \nHDF cell lines the centrosome was >3.0 \u03bcm distant from the \nNE (Fig. 2 A). To further investigate this phenomenon we \nlooked at centrosome position in a cell line from an X-EDMD \ncarrier, which has approximately equal numbers of emerin-\n positive and emerin-null cells. We found that in emerin-positive \ncells the centrosome was positioned next to the NE, whereas in \nemerin-negative cells the centrosome was >3.0 \u03bcm away from \nthe NE. Finally, we investigated the centrosome position in a \n lamin A\/C\u2013null HDF line in which emerin was located entirely \nwithin the endoplasmic reticulum (Muchir et al., 2000). In the \nlamin A\/C\u2013null cell line the centrosome was also >3.0 \u03bcm \naway from the NE, indicating that absence of emerin from the \nNE was the cause of the centrosome mislocalization (Fig. 2 B). \nTo confi rm that mislocalization of the centrosome was specifi c \nto absence of emerin from the NE, we investigated centrosome \npositions in a fi broblast cell line from a patient with Greenberg \ndysplasia, which were null for the INM protein lamin B recep-\ntor (LBR) (Waterham et al., 2003). Like EDMD, Greenberg \ndysplasia and the related disorder Pelger-Huey anomaly are \ncharacterized by nuclear morphological defects (Hoffman et al., \n2002). However, in LBR-null fi broblasts, emerin was located at \nthe NE and similarly the centrosome was positioned adjacent \nto the NE (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that centrosome mis-\nlocalization is specifi c to loss of emerin from the NE. To verify \nthese results, we performed knockdown of emerin by siRNA \nin normal HDFs (Fig. 2, D\u2013F). In HDFs transfected with the \nscrambled siRNA, centrosomes were found adjacent to the \nNE. In contrast, in HDFs that were transfected with siRNA spe-\ncifi c for emerin, the centrosome was located at a distance of \n>3.0 \u03bcm away from the NE, similar to the distances observed \nin X-EDMD cells.\nThis very intriguing result raised the important question \nof how a protein that is localized in the INM could affect the \nposition of the centrosome, an organelle that is localized at the \nONM. To investigate whether a yet-unidentifi ed emerin binding \npartner could help explain the observed phenomenon, we used \nrecombinant emerin peptides in coprecipitation experiments \nto identify new emerin binding partners. The peptide was used \nas a bait to precipitate interacting partners from the Xenopus \negg extracts, which were in turn chosen because they store \nvery large quantities of cytoskeleton and centriolar proteins in a \nFigure 1. Organization of the cytoskeleton in X-EDMD cells. Normal and emerin-null HDFs were fi xed with methanol\/acetone (1:1) and stained for \u03b2-actin, \nvimentin, and \u03b2-tubulin. No differences in the organization of the cytoskeleton between normal and emerin-null cells were observed, except for the position \nof the centrosome (arrowheads) relative to the NE. While in normal cells the centrosome is positioned next to the NE, in X-EDMD cells it localizes some dis-\ntance from the NE. Chromatin was stained with DAPI.

To confi rm that emerin is a \nmicrotubule (MT) binding protein, MT cosedimentation experi-\nments were performed in which purifi ed MTs were polymerized \nby taxol and incubated with the same emerin peptide (aa 73\u2013180) \nor two different emerin peptides corresponding to its chromatin \nbinding domain (aa 1\u201370)  or most of the nucleoplasmic domain \n(aa 1\u2013176) (Fig. 3 B).

Emerin 73\u2013180 bound to tubulin at an approximate ratio \nof 1:24, and this weaker interaction is likely due to misfolding \nof this peptide. Collectively, these data suggest that emerin is \na novel MT-interacting protein.\nThe interaction of emerin with \u03b2-tubulin led us to investi-\ngate whether MTs are involved in the attachment of the centro-\nsome to the NE. To investigate this possibility, normal and \nX-EDMD fi broblasts were treated with nocodazole and its ef-\nfects on MT organization and centrosome position were investi-\ngated (Fig. 3, C and D). As expected, nocodazole treatment led \nto the depolymerization of the MT network. Interestingly, when \nnormal HDFs were treated with nocodazole the centrosome was \nobserved to be located >3.0 \u03bcm away from the NE, just as was \nobserved in emerin-null fi broblasts. As a control, normal HDFs \nwere treated with latrunculin B to depolymerize the actin cyto-\nskeleton. In latrunculin B\u2013treated HDFs the centrosome was \nlocated adjacent to the NE, implying that only disruption of the \ntubulin cytoskeleton leads to an emerin-null phenocopy. We \nconfi rmed this fi nding using biochemical fractionation to deter-\nmine whether centrosomes cosedimented with the nucleus in a \nrange of HDF lines (Fig. S1, available at http:\/\/www.jcb.org\/\ncgi\/content\/full\/jcb.200702026\/DC1). In normal HDFs, nuclei \nand centrosomes cosedimented at a 1:1 ratio. In emerin-null HDFs \nor normal HDFs treated with nocodazole, nuclei and centrosomes \ncosedimented at a 1:0.4 ratio, again showing that centrosomes \nwere detached from the NE.\nAll the above experiments provide strong evidence that \nemerin links centrosomes to the NE via a MT association. Given \nthat emerin is a protein of the INM, this raised the question as to \nwhether emerin acts via another protein that crosses the NE. We \ntherefore investigated whether either SUN domain proteins or \none of the nesprins is also mislocalized in emerin- null HDFs \nas a fi rst step to determining whether these proteins might be \ninvolved in centrosome localization. We could not detect any \nchange in the distribution of SUN1 or nesprin 1 (not depicted) or \nSUN2 or nesprin 2 (Fig. S2, available at http:\/\/www.jcb.org\/cgi\/\nFigure 3.

(A) A His-tagged recombinant emerin \npeptide corresponding to aa 73\u2013180 was immobilized on \nNi2+-beads and used to pull down binding partners from \ncytosolic fractions of Xenopus egg extracts. Proteins that \nco eluted with emerin after treatment of the beads with Ni2+ \nwere resolved by SDS-PAGE (lane 4). As a control, Xenopus \ncytosol was incubated with the beads in absence of emerin \npeptides (lane 2). The purifi ed emerin peptide on its own is \nshown in lane 3.

As \na result of this fi nding we decided to reinvestigate the localization \nof emerin in normal fi broblasts.

The anti-Sun2 antibody used in this assay recognizes \na luminal domain, indicating that not only is the INM intact, but \nalso the ONM, strengthening the fi nding that a fraction of emerin \nresides at the ONM. To confi rm that the protein detected at the \nONM was indeed emerin, we performed siRNA knockdown \nof emerin on control fi broblasts and again stained the cells \nwith anti-emerin antibodies after digitonin permeabilization. In \nthese experiments knockdown was \n70% effi cient, and whereas \nemerin was detected at the ONM in fi broblasts treated with \nscrambled siRNA, staining was eliminated in cells transfected \nwith siRNA specifi c to emerin (Fig. 4 B). As a further control we \nalso stained X-EDMD fi broblasts, (which are null for emerin) \nor an X-EDMD carrier in which emerin is absent from \n50% \nof cells. We found that staining of the ONM was undetectable \nin emerin-null fi broblasts, further supporting the presence of \nemerin at the ONM. This fi nding implies that emerin residing at \nthe ONM can interact directly with centrioles via MTs. It has \nrecently been reported that localization of emerin at the INM is \ndependent upon the presence of both nesprin1\u03b1 and 2\u03b2 (Wheeler \net al., 2007). To investigate whether nesprins might also be \ninvolved in localization of emerin to the ONM, we transfected \nnormal HDF with a dominant-negative Sun1 mutant that causes \nloss of the ONM form of nesprin 2 (Crisp et al., 2006). We found \nthat emerin was still detected at the ONM in the presence of this \nmutant, suggesting that nesprin2 does not cause the localization \nof emerin to the ONM (Fig. 4 C).\nOverall, our results show that emerin interacts directly with \nMTs and that emerin and MTs both are necessary for the asso-\nciation of the centrosome with the NE. Our fi ndings are sup-\nported by previous work, which showed a colocalization of \nemerin with \u03b2-tubulin in mitotic cells (Dabauvalle et al., 1999) \nand an enrichment of emerin at the kinetochores, near the spindle \npoles, during NE reassembly (Haraguchi et al., 2000). Recent \nevidence has demonstrated how complexes involving lamins A\/C, \nthe SUN domain proteins, and the nesprins link the actin and \nintermediate fi lament cytoskeletons to the NE in mammalian \ncells (Wilhelmsen et al., 2005; Crisp et al., 2006). Our current \ndata now reveal how the tubulin cytoskeleton via the centriole \ninteracts with the NE in human fi broblasts.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\nHDF cells and LBR-null cells (provided by K. Hoffmann, Charit\u00e9 Humboldt \nUniversity, Berlin, Germany) were grown in DME supplemented with \n10 U\/ml penicillin, 50 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, and 10% vol\/vol NCS, and \nmaintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidifi ed atmosphere containing 5% CO2 until 80% \nconfl uence. Serial passage was performed in the presence of trypsin and \n0.5% EDTA.\nImmunofl uorescence and confocal microscopy\nHDFs were fi xed with methanol\/acetone (1:1) on ice for 5 min or with 4% \nparaformaldehyde for 12 min at RT followed by permeabilization either \nwith 1% Triton X-100 (for 5 min at RT) or with Digitonin (40 \u03bcg\/ml for \n2 min, on ice). Primary antibodies used and their dilutions are described \nin Table I. Anti-Sun2 was provided by B. Burke (University of Florida, \nGainesville, FL) and anti-Nesprin 2 K1 antibody was provided by \nI. Karakesisoglou (University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany). FITC- or \nTRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Stratech and \nchromatin was visualized with DAPI\/Mowiol.\nFor imaging, a confocal microscope (LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss \nMicroImaging, Inc.) with LSM510 image browser software (Carl Zeiss Micro-\nImaging, Inc.) was used at ambient temperature, equipped with 40\u00d7\/1.3 \nand 63\u00d7\/1.4 oil-immersion lenses and a non-imaging photodetection \ndevice (photomultiplier tube; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). A dynamic \nrange adjustment was used to optimize the signal for the fl uorophores, and \nimages were collected in multitrack mode. Any brightness and contrast \nadjustments were performed in Adobe Photoshop.\nGel electrophoresis and immunoblotting\nOne-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (1970). \nFor immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-\nbranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using the Mini Trans-Blot system (Bio-Rad \nLaboratories). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from \nJackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Bands were visualized by en-\nhanced chemiluminescence (ECL reagents; GE Healthcare).\nsiRNA\nEmerin-specifi c siRNA duplexes were obtained from Ambion. The sequence \nof sense nucleotides was as follows: 5\u2032-G G U G G A U G A U G A C G A U C U-\nU tt-3\u2032. RNAi transfection procedure was performed as in Harborth et al. \n(2001). Specifi c silencing of emerin was confi rmed by three indepen-\ndent experiments.\nProtein purifi cation and coprecipitation experiments\nHistidine-tagged emerin peptides were expressed in bacteria, extracted as sol-\nuble peptides, and purifi ed on Ni-NTA\u2013Agarose beads (QIAGEN) by immobi-\nlized metal affi nity chromatography according to the QIAGEN protocol.\nFor the pull-down experiments, purifi ed emerin peptide 73\u2013180 \nwas immobilized on Ni-beads and incubated with the cytosolic fraction \nof Xenopus egg extracts for 4 h at 4\u00b0C, on a roller. Non-specifi c binding \nwas removed with 250-mM NaCl washes. Emerin together with co-eluting \nproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Xenopus egg extracts were pre-\npared and fractionated to generate membrane-free cytosol as described by \nDrummond et al. (1999).\nTable I.

(1973). Microtubules were polymerized in the presence of \ntaxol as described previously (Smertenko et al., 2004). 10 \u03bcg of purifi ed \nemerin peptides 1\u201370 and 73\u2013180 were mixed with 20 \u03bcg of taxol-stabi-\nlized MTs and centrifuged at 200,000 g. No MTs were added to control \nsamples. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of the emerin \nfragments was quantifi ed in the gel using NIH Image software and normal-\nized by the mean. To measure the relative binding ratio of tubulin to emerin \nin the microtubules, microtubule cosedimentation assays were performed \nas described above, then the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and \nCoomassie brilliant blue R-250 was used to stain the gels. The gels were \nquantifi ed using NIH Image software. The average density values were \nmultiplied by the measured area values to get the absolute intensity, and \nthen the background values were subtracted from the protein band values. \nThe tubulin\/emering binding ratio was calculated using the following \nequation assuming that tubulin is present as heterodimer and emerin frag-\nment as monomer: R = (Itubulin \u00d7 Mremerin)\/(2 \u00d7 Iemerin \u00d7 Mrtubulin), where I is \nabsolute intensity for the corresponding protein band and Mr is molecular \nmass (50 kD for tubulin, 22 kD for aa 1\u2013176 fragment, and 15 kD for aa \n73\u2013180 fragment).\nTransfection of normal HDF with the Sun1 construct\nNormal HDFs were transfected with 2 \u03bcg of plasmid SS-HA-Sun1L-KDEL \n(Crisp et al., 2006) with the Amaxa Biosystems Nucleofection system using \nthe Basic Nucleofector kit for primary mammalian fi broblasts (VPI-1002) as \ndescribed by the manufacturer. Cells were fi xed 24 h after transfection with \n4% paraformaldehyde and underwent sequential permeabilization. Cells \nwere initially permeabilized with digitonin and stained with the rabbit-\nemerin AP8 antibody. Cells were then fi xed again with 4% paraformalde-\nhyde incubated with 1% Triton X-100 and stained with a mouse-HA tag \nantibody to detect the Sun1 construct.\nNuclear isolation experiments\nCells were grown to 90% confl uence and collected by centrifugation. Cell \npellets were resuspended in Nuclear Isolation Buffer (NIB) (250 mM NaCl, \n3 mM MgCl, 10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet, and protease inhibitor \ncocktail; 1 ml NIB\/106 cells) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Nuclei were \nreleased with a Wheaton homogenizer and isolated on coverslips by centrifu-\ngation (4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C) through a 30% sucrose cushion.\nOnline supplemental material\nFig. S1 shows nuclear isolation experiments in normal and X-EDMD cells \nwith increased salt concentration.
