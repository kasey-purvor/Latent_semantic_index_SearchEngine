This is empirically relevant because a large part of wage variation cannot\nbe explained by productivity differences (Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999)).1 Second,\nthe density of posted wages is declining and firms that post higher wages receive more appli-\ncants. These predictions are consistent with the evidence in Mortensen (2003) and Holzer,\nKatz and Krueger (1991), respectively, and they arise precisely because we model search to\nbe directed, as opposed to random.2 Third, the number of matches is inefficiently low in\ncontrast to most directed search models where constrained efficiency obtains.\nModels of directed search combine the presence of frictions, which appear to be pervasive\nin the labor market, with a guiding role for prices, which is mostly absent in random search\nmodels. In directed search, every firm publicly posts and commits to a wage and each worker\nchooses the job to which he applies. Frictions are introduced by assuming that workers\ncannot coordinate their search decisions. A single wage is posted in the unique equilibrium of\na homogeneous agent environment (Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001)). Constrained efficiency\nobtains due to the firms\u2019 ability to price their hiring probability (Moen (1997)).3\nIn this paper each worker simultaneously applies forN jobs. Sending multiple applications\nhas two effects. First, it increases the probability of getting a job. Second, it introduces a\nportfolio choice element to the worker\u2019s optimization problem: The worker\u2019s expected utility\nis a non-trivial function of the combination of firms where he applies because his payoffs only\ndepend on the most attractive offer that he receives. As a result, despite risk neutrality, he\ncares about the probability of success over and above the expected payoff of each individual\napplication.4 Loosely speaking, a worker\u2019s optimal strategy is to apply to both \u201csafe\u201d low-\n1Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) find that observable worker characteristics explains only 30 percent\nof wage differentials and controlling for unobserved worker heterogeneity can account for only half of the\nresidual variation. Similarly, Krueger and Summers (1988) and Katz and Gibbons (1992) conclude that\nobserved and unobserved productivity differences cannot account for the full extent of wage variation.\n2Models of random search, such as Burdett and Mortensen (1998), typically predict an increasing density\nwhen workers and firms are homogeneous which is generally seen as a failing of the basic model (Mortensen\n(2003)). In random search models the arrival rate of workers does not depend on the wage the firm is offering.\n3By contrast, in random search models workers looking for employment have no prior information about\nthe characteristics of the firms that they sample and efficiency is a non-generic outcome (Hosios (1990)).\n4Two assumptions are crucial for the portfolio choice problem: firms commit to the wages that they post\n2\nwage and \u201crisky\u201d high-wage jobs: the former provide a high probability of getting a job offer\nbut for low pay; the latter provide high payoff conditional on success while the downside risk\nis limited by the possibility of getting the low wage job. This decision rule is a special case\nof the marginal improvement algorithm proposed in Chade and Smith (2006).\nThe main theoretical contribution of our paper is to integrate this portfolio choice problem\ninto an equilibrium framework where both the success probabilities and the payoffs (wages)\nare equilibrium outcomes. The willingness of workers to send each application to a separate\nwage level creates an incentive for firms to post different wages. In equilibrium, exactly\nN wages are posted and every worker applies once to each distinct wage level. Since high\nwage firms receive more applicants, our characterization implies that the wage density is\ndeclining. The firms\u2019 expected profits are equal at all wage levels because the lower margins\nof high wages are balanced with a higher probability of filling the vacancy. It is important\nto reiterate, however, that this intuition fails in the single application case. The incentives\nfor different wages to be posted arise only because every worker applies for multiple jobs.\nOur paper is related to Peters (1991) and Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001) who solve\ndifferent versions of the single application, homogeneous agent, directed search model. Shi\n(2002) and Shimer (2005) introduce firm and worker heterogeneity leading to wage dispersion\nwhich is, however, driven by the underlying dispersion in productivity. In Albrecht, Gautier\nand Vroman (2006) workers apply for multiple jobs in a directed search framework but with\ntwo crucial differences from our paper: first, when two or more firms make a job offer to the\nsame worker they engage in Bertrand competition, while in this paper we assume commitment\nto posted wages; second, they only examine equilibria where a single wage is posted which\nmeans that there is no portfolio choice problem for the workers. We discuss these differences\nin the conclusions.\nDelacroix and Shi (2006) develop a single-application directed search model with on-the-\njob search. The focus of their paper is on worker flows across jobs, as well as wage dispersion,\nand workers receive the responses from all applications before deciding which offer to accept.\n3\nbut their equilibrium exhibits many similarities to ours. In their model the worker faces a\nportfolio choice problem over time as opposed to at a single instance, which is the case here.\nThe outside option of employed job seekers depends on the wage that they are currently\nreceiving and hence highly-paid workers are willing to tolerate a lower probability of getting\na job than low-paid or unemployed workers. This endogenous heterogeneity in outside options\nleads to wage dispersion with a declining density for reasons similar to our paper.\nChade and Smith (2006) provide the optimal algorithm for solving the following general\nportfolio choice problem: a decision maker faces a number of exogenous (payoff, probability-\nof-success) pairs and he has to determine how many applications to send and where to apply\ngiven that only the best realized alternative is exercised. That algorithm is an important\nbuilding block in our analysis, where payoffs and probabilities are endogenized. Chade, Lewis\nand Smith (2004) and Nagypal (2004) develop equilibrium models of directed college choice\nwhere applicants can simultaneously apply to many colleges. In both papers the payoffs of\nattending a particular college are exogenous and the focus is on whether there is assortative\nmatching between students and colleges in the context of incomplete information.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3\ndiscusses the special case when workers send two applications which provides many important\ninsights. The following section extends the results to an arbitrary (but finite) number of\napplications. Section 5 evaluates the distribution of wages and illustrates the reason why our\ndirected search model generates a very different shape compared to random search models.\nVarious extensions are considered in section 6 and section 7 concludes.\n2 The Model\nIn this section we introduce the main features of the model, and define outcomes, payoffs,\nand equilibrium. At the end we state the main theorem and prove a preliminary result.\n4\n2.1 Environment and Strategies\nThere is a continuum of workers of measure b and a continuum of firms of measure 1. Each\nfirm has one vacancy. All workers and all firms are identical, risk neutral, and they produce\none unit of output when matched and zero otherwise. The utility of an employed worker is\nequal to his wage and the profits of a firm that employs a worker at wage w are given by\n1\u2212 w. The payoffs of unmatched agents are normalized to zero.\nThe matching process has four distinct stages. Firms start by simultaneously posting\n(and committing to) wages. Then, all postings are observed by the workers and each worker\nsends N applications to N different firms. Firms follow by making a job offer to one of\nthe applicants they have received, if any. Last, workers that get one or more offers choose\nwhich job to accept. Importantly, an applicant receives a response from all the firms that\nhe has applied to before having to make a decision.5 If a firm\u2019s chosen applicant rejects the\njob offer then the firm remains unmatched.6 Firms therefore compete for workers in two\nseparate stages: they want to attract at least one applicant in the second stage and they try\nto keep that applicant in the last stage; we label these \u201cex ante\u201d and \u201cex post\u201d competition,\nrespectively.\nAs is common in the directed search literature, trading frictions are introduced by focusing\non symmetric mixed strategies for workers. The main idea is that asymmetric strategies\nrequire a lot of coordination since each worker has to know his personal strategy. Therefore,\na single symmetric strategy appears to be a more plausible outcome in a large market where\ncoordination among workers is difficult to achieve. For simplicity, it is also assumed that\nworkers\u2019 strategies are anonymous, i.e. a worker treats identically all the firms that post the\nsame wage. This assumption, however, is not necessary: it is possible to let workers condition\n5For instance, if responses arrived sequentially and the worker had to decide whether to accept or reject\nan offer before receiving additional responses, the portfolio choice problem would be very different because\nrisky applications would lose part of their option value.\n6Kircher (2007) relaxes this assumption and allows the recall of all applicants in the case a firm\u2019s offer\nis rejected. Though the matching process is quite different, the unique equilibrium exhibits an N -point\ndistribution of posted wages suggesting that the qualitative features of our model are robust. However,\nthe predictions of that model are different concerning the shape of the distribution of wages. Furthermore,\nconstrained efficiency is recovered in Kircher (2007) as discussed in 3.3.\n5\non the firms\u2019 names (say, a real number in [0,1]) but this would clutter the exposition without\nchanging the results. Last, the firms also follow anonymous strategies, meaning that they\ntreat all workers the same in the event that they receive multiple applicants. This is the\nstandard environment in the directed search literature, such as Peters (1991) or Burdett,\nShi and Wright (2001), except for the innocuous assumption of the anonymity of workers\u2019\nstrategies and the key difference that we allow multiple applications.\nBefore describing the agents\u2019 strategies, observe that the last two stages of the game\ncan be immediately solved. In the fourth stage, workers with multiple job offers choose the\nhighest wage and randomize with equal probabilities in the case of a tie. In the third stage,\nfirms with multiple applicants choose one at random. Therefore we only need to consider the\nstrategies for the first two stages.\nA strategy for the firm is a wage w that it posts in the beginning of the game. Denote the\ndistribution of posted wages by F with support WF . In the second stage, workers observe F\nand decide where to apply. By anonymity, the strategy of a worker can be summarized by\nthe wages where he applies (in particular, the name of the firm that receives each application\ndoes not matter). Therefore, a pure strategy for a worker is an N -tuple of wages to which\nhe applies and a mixed strategy is a randomization over different N -tuples. We denote the\nworkers\u2019 strategy by GF , which is a cumulative distribution function on [0, 1]\nN conditional\non the posted distribution F . Let GiF be the marginal distribution of the ith application\nwith support W iG and define WG \u2261 \u222aNi=1W iG. That is, WG denotes the set of the wages that\nreceive some application with positive probability.\nGiven any N -tuple w = (w1, w2, ..., wN) chosen by the worker, we assume that wN \u2265\nwN\u22121 \u2265 ... \u2265 w1 and that the worker chooses the wage with the higher index in the case\nof a tie. Both assumptions are without loss of generality. This is clear in the former as-\nsumption. Concerning the latter, the randomization between tied wages can occur before the\napplications are actually sent and therefore a higher index can be assigned to the \u201cpreferred\u201d\nwage.\n6\n2.2 Outcomes and Equilibrium\nWe define q(w) to be the probability that a firm posting w receives at least one application\nand \u03c8(w) to be the conditional probability that a randomly chosen worker who has applied\nto such a firm accepts a different job offer (i.e. the probability that the firm does not get the\nworker). Let p(w) be the probability that a worker applying to wage w gets an offer. When\na wage is not posted by any firm (w \/\u2208 WF ) we have p(w) = 0 which immediately implies\nthat WG \u2282 WF . Last, we define the value of an individual application to some wage w to be\np(w) w.\nThe expected profits of a firm that posts w and the expected utility of a worker who\napplies to w are given by\npi(w) = q(w) (1\u2212 \u03c8(w)) (1\u2212 w), (1)\nU(w) = p(wN) wN + (1\u2212 p(wN)) p(wN\u22121) wN\u22121\n+...+\nN\u220f\ni=2\n(1\u2212 p(wi)) p(w1) w1. (2)\nThe expected profits of a firm are equal to the probability that at least one worker applies\nfor the job times the retention probability times (1\u2212 w). A worker gets utility wN from his\nhighest application, which is successful with probability p(wN). With the complementary\nprobability that application fails and with probability p(wN\u22121) he receives wN\u22121. And so on.\nWe now relate p, q and \u03c8 to the agents\u2019 strategies. On WF , both p(w) and q(w) depend\non the average queue length at w, which is denoted by \u03bb(w). Intuitively, the queue length\nfaced by a firm offering wage w is given by the number of applications sent to w divided by\nthe number of firms who post that wage. Formally, \u03bb(w) is defined by the integral equation:\n\u222b w\n0\n\u03bb(w\u02dc) dF (w\u02dc) = b G\u02c6F (w), (3)\nwhere G\u02c6F (w) is the expected number of applications that a worker sends to wages no greater\n7\nthan w, i.e. G\u02c6F (w) =\n\u2211N\ni=1G\ni\nF (w). The right hand side of equation (3) gives the number\nof applications that are sent up to wage w by all workers, while the left hand side gives the\nnumber of firms that post a wage up to w multiplied by the average number of applications\nthey receive.\nAnonymity implies that a worker who sends an application to some wage w randomizes\nover all the firms offering that wage. As a result, the number of applications received by a\nfirm posting w is random and follows a Poisson distribution with mean \u03bb(w).7 Therefore the\nprobability that a firm posting w receives at least one application is q(w) = 1\u2212e\u2212\u03bb(w) and the\nprobability that a worker who applies to such a firm gets an offer is p(w) = (1\u2212e\u2212\u03bb(w))\/\u03bb(w),\nwhere p(w\u02dc) = 1 when \u03bb(w\u02dc) = 0.8\nIn order to evaluate \u03c8(w) for some w \u2208 WF we need to find the probability that, after\napplying to w, a worker rejects an offer from that firm in favor of a different job. As described\nearlier, a worker who receives multiple offers chooses by construction the wage with the higher\nindex. Therefore the probability that a worker accepts an offer from wj conditional on having\napplied to (wj, w\u2212j) is given by Rj(wj, w\u2212j) \u2261\n\u220f\nk>j(1\u2212 p(wk)). We can now integrate over\nall the possible wages that a worker applies to. Let Pr[j|w] be the conditional probability\nthat a worker who applied to w \u2208 WF did so with his jth application. Furthermore, let\nGjF (w\u2212j|w) be the conditional distribution over the other applications, given that the jth\napplication was sent to wage w. Then \u03c8(w) is given by\n\u03c8(w) = 1\u2212\nN\u2211\nj=1\nPr[j|w]\n\u222b\nRj(w,w\u2212j) dG\nj\nF (w\u2212j|w). (4)\nWe have defined \u03bb(w) and \u03c8(w) for wages on the support of F which means that the\nworkers\u2019 optimization problem can be solved for a given distribution of posted wages. To\n7Suppose that n applications are randomly allocated to m firms. The number of applications received\nby a particular firm follows a binomial distribution with probability 1\/m and sample size n. As n,m \u2192 \u221e\nkeeping n\/m = \u03bb the binomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution with mean \u03bb.\n8This matching process does not depend on the anonymity of the worker strategies. Symmetry and\noptimality clearly imply that firms with the same wage must have the same expected queue length. Poisson\nmatching follows.\n8\nsolve the firm\u2019s optimization problem, \u03bb(w) and \u03c8(w) need to be well-defined on the full\ndomain [0,1] since a firm needs to know the queue length and retention probability that it\nwould face at any wage it could post. Although no one actually applies to wages that are\nnot posted, the queue lengths at such wages could be positive since they represent the firms\u2019\nbeliefs about how many workers would apply if these wage were offered; and similarly for\n\u03c8(w).\nIt turns out that determining off-equilibrium beliefs presents a challenge. Given the\nsequential structure of the model, the most natural approach would be to require subgame\nperfection for the firms\u2019 off-equilibrium beliefs. However, the fact that this is a continuum\neconomy means that the symmetric response of a mass of workers to the deviation of a single\n(zero measure) firm is not well-defined. Formally, \u03bb(w) and \u03c8(w) cannot be determined using\nequations (3) and (4) for w \/\u2208 WF because both F and GF have zero density at those wages.\nTo get around this issue we define \u03bb and \u03c8 as if \u201cmany\u201d firms post every wage in [0,1] so\nthat the reaction of workers can be meaningfully evaluated. We introduce a fraction of noise\nfirms of measure \u000f that post a wage at random from some distribution F\u02dc with full support. An\nalternative interpretation is that firms make a mistake with probability \u000f. Given a candidate\nF , the distribution of posted wages becomes F\u000f(w) = (1 \u2212 \u000f) F (w) + \u000f F\u02dc (w) and the game\ncan be analyzed from the second stage onwards. Let GF\u000f denote the equilibrium response of\nworkers when facing F\u000f. The outcomes \u03bb\u000f and \u03c8\u000f can be calculated on the entire domain [0,1]\nusing F\u000f, GF\u000f , and equations (3) and (4). As \u000f \u2192 0 the perturbed distribution converges to\nF , and we define \u03bb(w) = lim\u000f\u21920 \u03bb\u000f(w) and \u03c8(w) = lim\u000f\u21920 \u03c8\u000f(w) for all w \u2208 [0, 1]. We should\nemphasize that noise firms are simply a means of evaluating the profits that a firm would\nobtain when deviating and, as we will show in the next section, none of our results depend\non the exact choice of F\u02dc . The only crucial requirement is that the noise distribution has full\nsupport because otherwise the same problem would recur at any wage which is outside the\nsupport of F\u02dc .9\n9We explored two further alternatives, both of which lead to the same results (the proof is available upon\nrequest). The first is to introduce trembles on a finite but collapsing grid. The second alternative is the\n9\nWe can now define an equilibrium, given a distribution with full support F\u02dc .\nDefinition 2.1 An equilibrium is a set of strategies {F,GF} such that\n1. pi(w) \u2265 pi(w\u2032) for all w \u2208 WF and w\u2032 \u2208 [0, 1].\n2. U(w) \u2265 U(w\u2032) for all w \u2208 suppGF and w\u2032 \u2208 [0, 1]N .\nThe first condition ensures that no firm can increase its profits by posting a different wage\nthan prescribed by F . The second condition ensures that no worker can increase his expected\nutility by applying to a different set of wages.\nWe now state the main theorem of this paper.\nTheorem 2.1 An equilibrium exists for all N and is unique when N = 2. N different\nwages are posted by firms and every worker sends one application to each distinct wage. The\nexpected number of applicants is increasing with the wage. The number of firms that post a\ngiven wage is decreasing with the wage. The equilibria are not constrained efficient.\n2.3 A Preliminary Result\nThe next lemma establishes some immediate conditions on the expected queue of applications\nwhich will be useful in the following sections. Let w be the lowest wage where some worker\napplies, i.e. w = inf{w \u2208 WG}.\nLemma 2.1 Given any distribution of posted wages, worker optimization implies that \u03bb(w)\nis continuous and strictly increasing on [w, 1] \u2229WF .\nmarket utility approach used in Moen (1997), Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (1999), Shi (2001) and Shimer (2005)\nfor the N = 1 case. It posits that workers\u2019 response to deviations is such that they are indifferent between\napplying to any wage. Our multiple application framework makes this concept less appealing due to the\nnotational and expositional complexity of specifying indifferences over sets of wages (see Kircher (2007) for\nthat specification in a related model). A third potential approach is to solve for the subgame perfect Nash\nequilibrium of a finite version of the same model and then take the limit of that equilibrium as the number of\nagents goes to infinity, as in Peters (2000) and Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001). While arguably the correct\n(or most reasonable) approach, this problem becomes intractable when introducing multiple applications\nbecause the probability of success is correlated across applications (see Albrecht, Gautier, Tan, and Vroman\n(2004)).\n10\nProof. Consider the maximization problem of a single worker. Recall that the probability\nof getting a job is given by p(w) = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb(w))\/\u03bb(w) for w \u2208 WF which a strictly decreas-\ning function of \u03bb(w). If \u03bb(w) is not strictly increasing there exist w,w\u2032 \u2208 WF such that\nw > w\u2032, p(w) \u2265 p(w\u2032) with w\u2032 \u2208 WG. A worker who applies to w\u2032 with positive probability\ncan profitably deviate by switching to w since that wage is higher and the probability of\ngetting an offer is at least as high. Therefore, applying to w\u2032 is inconsistent with the worker\u2019s\noptimizing behavior and hence, when considering the fact that all workers optimize, any\nequilibrium \u03bb(w) has to be strictly increasing above the lowest wage where workers apply,\ni.e. on [w, 1]\u2229WF . Next, suppose that \u03bb(w) is discontinuous at some w\u02c6 \u2208 [w, 1]\u2229WF . Then\nthe probability of getting a job offer is also discontinuous at w\u02c6 and a worker applying in a\nneighborhood of that wage has an obvious profitable deviation. This implies that \u03bb(w) has\nto be continuous in equilibrium.\nThe properties described in the lemma are very natural. The expected number of appli-\ncants increases with the wage that a firm posts, which also implies that the probability of\ngetting an offer for that job is strictly decreasing. Moreover, any discontinuity in p(w) leads\nto the possibility of a profitable deviation for some worker since he can discretely increase\nhis chances of an offer by slightly changing the wage that he applies for. This means that\nin equilibrium \u03bb(w) is continuous regardless of the underlying F . In particular, even if a\npositive measure of firms post some wage, the optimal response of workers is to send a posi-\ntive measure of applications to that wage and hence there are no jumps in the queue length.\nThese results hold for any perturbation and hence they hold for the unperturbed game as\nwell, which implies that the queue length that a firm expects is continuously increasing in\nw regardless of whether that wage is posted or not.10 Last, note that any noise distribution\n10It is not hard to show that the functions \u03bb\u000f(w) are equicontinuous and hence \u03bb(w) \u2261 lim\u000f\u21920 \u03bb\u000f(w) is\ncontinuous in w. Furthermore, the gradient of \u03bb\u000f(w) is bounded away from zero at any w where the queue\nlength converges to a strictly positive limit (by an argument similar to lemma 2.1) which means that \u03bb(w)\nis strictly increasing in (w, 1). The only requirement for the above statements to hold is that at least some\nfirms post a non-zero wage (i.e. F (0) < 1) which arises in any equilibrium as shown in proposition 3.2.\n11\nwith full support leads to monotonicity and continuity. Using lemma 2.1 we restrict attention\nto \u03bb(w) that are continuous and strictly increasing in the relevant range for the remainder\nof the paper.\n3 A Special Case: N = 2\nWe now look at the special case where workers send only two applications which provides\nmany of the main insights. The case of a general N is discussed in the next section. We\nstart by solving the workers\u2019 optimization problem given an arbitrary distribution of posted\nwages. We then characterize the wages that firms post in equilibrium, establish existence\nand uniqueness, and evaluate efficiency.\n3.1 Worker Optimization\nWe start by characterizing the equilibrium response of workers that face an arbitrary distri-\nbution of posted wages F . This distribution could be the result of a perturbation but in that\ncase the subscript \u000f is omitted to keep notation simple.\nWe consider first the problem of a worker who optimizes given F and some strategy\nof other workers, GF .\n11 The queue length at the offered wages, and hence the probability\nof success, is determined by equation (3). Thus, the worker takes the menu of wage and\nprobability pairs as given when contemplating where to apply. The individual worker\u2019s\nproblem is a special case of that analyzed by Chade and Smith (2006). The main difference\nis that in this paper a worker can send both applications to firms with the same wage, which\nturns out to simplify the analysis considerably and allows the following derivation. The\nworker solves\nmax\n(w2,w1)\u2208W2F\np(w2) w2 + (1\u2212 p(w2)) p(w1) w1, (5)\n11The only restriction on GF is that the resulting queue length is continuous and strictly increasing on the\nrelevant domain, since lemma 2.1 proves that these properties are necessary for equilibrium.\n12\nwhere w2 \u2265 w1 by convention.12 Differentiability of p(w) is not guaranteed so the problem\ncannot be solved by taking the first order conditions. Even though this is a simultaneous\nchoice problem, it can be simplified by evaluating the low wage application separately from\nthe high wage application. That is, the problem admits a convenient recursive solution.\nThe low wage application is exercised only if w2 fails, which means that the optimal choice\nfor w1 solves\nmax\nw\u2208WF\np(w) w. (6)\nLet u1 denote this maximum value. Given that the worker sends his low wage application to\na particular w1 that solves (6), his optimal choice for the high wage application solves\nmax\nw\u2208WF\np(w) w + (1\u2212 p(w)) u1. (7)\nLet u2 denote the highest utility a worker can receive when sending two applications. One\ncan readily verify that a pair of wages is a solution to (5) if and only if it solves (6) and (7),\nand therefore the recursive procedure yields the optimal decision.\nWe now exploit the structure of our model to highlight a useful feature of the solution to\nthe worker\u2019s portfolio choice problem. Let w\u00af be the highest wage that yields value equal to\nu1, i.e. w\u00af = max{w \u2208 WF |p(w) w = u1}. The next proposition shows that the worker can\nsolve the two problems independently of each other.\nProposition 3.1 Given any distribution of posted wages, a necessary condition for opti-\nmization is that w1 \u2264 w\u00af \u2264 w2 holds for every (w1, w2) to which the worker is willing to\napply.\nProof. Suppose this is not true. Since w1 \u2264 w2 the only other possibilities are w\u00af < w1 or\nw2 < w\u00af. By construction w1 > w\u00af implies that p(w1) w1 < u1 which cannot be optimal. If\n12The maximum is well-defined because \u03bb(w) is continuous and WF is a closed set. Similarly for the rest\nof the paper.\n13\nw2 < w\u00af then the worker can deviate and send his high wage application to w\u00af instead of w2.\nThis deviation is profitable because\np(w\u00af) w\u00af + (1\u2212 p(w\u00af)) p(w1) w1 \u2212 [p(w2) w2 + (1\u2212 p(w2)) p(w1) w1] =\n[p(w\u00af) w\u00af \u2212 p(w2) w2] + [p(w2)\u2212 p(w\u00af)] p(w1) w1 > 0. (8)\nThe first term of (8) is non-negative since w\u00af provides the highest possible value by definition.\nThe second term is strictly positive because w\u00af > w2 \u21d2 p(w\u00af) < p(w2), by lemma 2.1.\nThe fact that, given F , all workers solve the same optimization problem means that we\ncan use proposition 3.1 to determine some of the outcomes of interest. Any (symmetric)\nequilibrium strategy by workers, GF , gives rise to the objects u1, u2, and w\u00af which determine\n\u03bb(w) in the following way. A firm that posts a wage in [0, u1) does not receive any applications\nsince the value of that job is too low regardless of the queue length. A firm that posts a\nwage in [u1, w\u00af] receives a worker\u2019s low application and hence its queue length is such that\nthe job\u2019s value is given by u1. A wage in [w\u00af, 1] receives a worker\u2019s high application and\ntherefore it provides utility u2 when coupled with a wage in [u1, w\u00af]. This implies that a\nworker is indifferent about which combination of wages to apply for so long as the wages are\non opposite sides of w\u00af. These results hold for any perturbed distribution of wages and hence\nthey hold in the limit as \u000f\u2192 0. To summarize this discussion, the queue length that a firm\nfaces when it posts a wage w is uniquely defined by the following conditions:\np(w) w = u1, \u2200 w \u2208 [u1, w\u00af] (9)\np(w) w + (1\u2212 p(w)) u1 = u2, \u2200 w \u2208 [w\u00af, 1]. (10)\nThese observations are illustrated in figure 1. The high indifference curve, IC-H, traces the\nwage and queue length pairs where workers are willing to send a high wage application, while\nIC-L is the indifference curve for the low wage applications. The two curves intersect at w\u00af\n14\nwhere workers are indifferent about whether they apply with a high or a low application. The\nequilibrium queue length for any wage is given by the upper envelope of the two indifference\ncurves: if the queue length is below the dashed line at some wage w\u02c6, then a worker can move\nto a higher indifference curve by applying to w\u02c6 instead of some other w (note that utility\nincreases in the southeast direction). In other words, the queue length is \u2018bid up\u2019 to IC-H\nfor w > w\u00af and to IC-L for w < w\u00af. Hence the dashed line is the indifference curve that firms\nanticipate when contemplating which wage to post.\nWage\nQueue \nLength\nIC-L\nIC-H\nw\nIC-H: p(w) w+ (1-p(w)) u1 = u2\nIC-L: p(w) w = u1\nFigure 1: Workers\u2019 application behavior. IC-H and IC-L are the workers\u2019 indifference curves for \u2018high\u2019 and\n\u2018low\u2019 applications. Linearity is only used for illustration.\nIt is worth noting that while the total utility of any pair of wages is always equal to u2,\nwages that are strictly above w\u00af give value that is strictly lower than u1. Workers nevertheless\napply there which may appear to be counterintuitive at first sight: if a worker can apply to\nwages that offer value u1, why would he choose some wage with a strictly lower individual\nvalue? The answer is that the return to failure in the high wage application is not zero: it is\nequal to the value that the next application brings in, as can be seen in equation (10). As a\nresult, when the worker chooses where to send his high wage application he faces a tradeoff\nbetween the value that he can get from that particular application and the probability of\nexercising his fallback option, i.e. the low wage application. Since the low wage provides\nwith insurance against the possible failure of w2, it is profitable for the worker to try a risky\n15\napplication that has high returns conditional on success (i.e., the wage is high) and also offers\na high probability of continuing to the next application. Therefore, the low wage application\ngoes to a relatively \u2018safe\u2019 region and the high application is sent to a \u2018risky\u2019 part of the wage\ndistribution.13\nThe next result proves that wage dispersion is present in all equilibria.\nProposition 3.2 There does not exist an equilibrium in which only one wage is posted.\nProof. Assume that an equilibrium exists where all firms post the same wage w\u2217. A firm\u2019s\nexpected profits are given by pi(w\u2217) = q(w\u2217) (1\u2212w\u2217) (1\u2212 \u03c8(w\u2217)). We proceed to show that\nfirms have a profitable deviation.\nConsider w\u2217 \u2208 (0, 1) first. A worker sends both his applications to w\u2217 and, with positive\nprobability, he receives two equally good offers and randomizes between them. \u03c8(w\u2217) > 0\nfollows. Proposition 3.1 implies that w\u00af = w\u2217 when trembles are sufficiently small, since\notherwise all workers would send one of their applications to the arbitrarily few noise firms\nwhich is clearly suboptimal. Therefore \u03c8(w) = 0 \u2200 w > w\u2217 for \u000f small enough and hence\nthis property holds in the limit as \u000f \u2192 0. Since the queue length (and q(w)) is increasing\nin w, the profits of a firm that posts a wage just above w\u2217 are equal to limw\u2198w\u2217 pi(w) =\nq(w\u2217) (1\u2212 w\u2217) > q(w\u2217) (1\u2212 w\u2217) (1\u2212 \u03c8(w\u2217)) = pi(w\u2217). Therefore offering a wage just above\nw\u2217 is a profitable deviation.\nIf w\u2217 = 1, firms make zero expected profits. Equation (9) implies that there is some\nw\u02dc < 1 close enough to 1 which has strictly positive queue length in the unperturbed game,\nyielding a profitable deviation. If w\u2217 = 0, a worker receives zero expected utility and so for\nany \u000f > 0 he sends both applications to some of the positive wages. As the trembles become\nsmaller the hiring probability of a firm with a strictly positive wage converges to one and\n13In contrast, in models of directed search where the wage dispersion is driven by firms\u2019 productivity\nheterogeneity every application yields the same value to identical workers (e.g. Shi (2002), Shimer (2005)).\nThe reason is that in those models every worker has one application to send and hence there is no portfolio\nchoice problem, which is at the heart of the distinction between \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018risky\u2019 applications.\n16\nhence pi(w\u02dc) = 1\u2212 w\u02dc > q(0) (1\u2212 \u03c8(0)) for w\u02dc close enough to zero.\nThe intuition of the proof is straightforward. If a single wage is posted, workers are indif-\nferent about which firm to work for and hence they randomize when receiving multiple job\noffers. When posting a slightly higher wage, a deviant firm hires its preferred applicant for\nsure even if that worker receives other offers (the deviant firm also has a slightly higher ex-\npected queue length). This deviation raises profits since the increase in the hiring probability\nis discrete, while the increase in the wage can be arbitrarily small.\nIt is important to note that workers respond to wage differentials in different ways depend-\ning on whether they are at the stage of sending their initial applications (ex ante competition\nfor the firms) or whether they are deciding which of their offers to accept (ex post com-\npetition). In the first case they respond in a continuous way, since a slightly higher wage\ncomes with a slightly lower probability of acceptance due to the market frictions. This force,\npresent in all models of directed search, allows firms to post interior wages and prevents a\nBertrand outcome. In the last stage, however, there is no possibility of being rationed and\nworkers accept the highest wage offer with probability one no matter how small the differ-\nence. As a result, in this event their strategy is discontinuous in the wage level: arbitrarily\nsmall differences in wages lead to very pronounced changes in behavior. It is therefore the\nex post competition among firms that precludes a single wage equilibrium.\n3.2 Firm Optimization\nWe now turn to the analysis of the first stage of the model. We prove that in equilibrium\nexactly two wages are posted when each worker sends two applications. We proceed to\ncharacterize them and prove the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium.\nA firm chooses what wage to post given the strategies of other firms, F , and the workers\u2019\n17\nresponse, GF which determine the equilibrium objects {w\u00af, u1, u2}. It solves\nmax\nw\u2208[0,1]\nq(w) [1\u2212 \u03c8(w)] (1\u2212 w), (11)\nThe probability that the firm receives at least one applicant, q(w), depends on the average\nqueue length according to q(w) = 1\u2212e\u2212\u03bb(w) and the queue length is determined by equations\n(9) and (10). The probability of losing a worker after making an offer, \u03c8(w), depends on\nwhether a wage is above or below the cutoff w\u00af which determines the type of application\nreceived (high or low). We label the firms that attract high (low) wage applications as high\n(low) wage firms. While this problem looks complicated, the results of the previous section\nhelp to simplify it considerably. In what follows, we provide the main characterization re-\nsult of this section: all high wage firms post w\u22172 and all low wage firms post w\n\u2217\n1, where w\n\u2217\n2 > w\n\u2217\n1.\nAn offer by a high wage firm is never rejected since it is an applicant\u2019s best alternative.\nTherefore \u03c8(w) = 0 when w > w\u00af and the problem of a high wage firm is given by:14\nmax\nw\u2208[w\u00af,1]\n[1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb(w)] (1\u2212 w) (12)\ns.t. p(w) w + (1\u2212 p(w)) u1 = u2. (13)\nRearranging (13) yields w = u1 + (u2 \u2212 u1)\/p(w), where p(w) = [1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb(w)]\/\u03bb(w). Since\nthe mapping between the wage and the queue length is one-to-one we can substitute this\nexpression into the objective function and maximize over \u03bb rather than w:\nmax\n\u03bb\u2265\u03bb\u00af\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb) (1\u2212 u1) \u2212 \u03bb (u2 \u2212 u1), (14)\n14In principle, \u03c8(w\u00af) > 0 is a possibility since w\u00af might also attract low wage applications. However, if\nw\u00af 6\u2208 argmax q(w) [1\u2212\u03c8(w)] (1\u2212w) then the value of \u03c8(w\u00af) is irrelevant; if w\u00af \u2208 argmax q(w) [1\u2212\u03c8(w)] (1\u2212w)\nthen \u03c8(w\u00af) > 0 contradicts optimality since wages arbitrarily close but higher than w\u00af would be preferable\nto w\u00af by an argument similar to proposition 3.2. Therefore the maximization problem in (12) is specified\ncorrectly.\n18\nwhere \u03bb\u00af = \u03bb(w\u00af). This is a strictly concave function since u1 < u2 < 1. Strict concavity\nimplies that the profit maximization problem of a high wage firm has a unique solution,\n\u03bb\u22172, which corresponds to some wage w\n\u2217\n2. That wage is either characterized by the first order\nconditions, in which case it is in the interior of the domain, w\u02c62 \u2208 (w\u00af, 1) with w\u22172 = \u03bb\u02c62 = \u03bb(w\u02c62),\nor it lies at the lower boundary of the high wage range, \u03bb\u22172 = w\u00af. Also, note that all high\nwage firms post the same wage in equilibrium since they all face the same problem.\nThe next step is to show that w\u22172 = w\u02c62 is inconsistent with equilibrium, leaving w\n\u2217\n2 = w\u00af\nas the only candidate. We prove this by contradiction: we first assume that posting w\u02c62 is\nthe outcome of high wage firms\u2019 profit maximization; we then prove that in that event low\nwage firms make lower profits which cannot happen in equilibrium. Setting the first order\ncondition of equation (14) to zero yields u2\u2212u1 = e\u2212\u03bb\u02c62 (1\u2212u1). Substituting this expression\ninto the profit function and rearranging results in the the following expression for the profits\nof high wage firms:\npi(w\u02c62) = (1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u02c62) (1\u2212 u1) (1\u2212 \u03bb\u02c62 e\n\u2212\u03bb\u02c62\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u02c62 ) (15)\nNow consider low wage firms. A low wage firm retains an applicant only if he does not\nhave a high wage offer. The probability of that event is 1 \u2212 p(w\u02c62) since w\u02c62 is the only high\nwage that is posted. The profits of a low wage firm, posting some w1 < w\u00af, are given by\npi(w1) = (1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb(w1)) (1\u2212 w1) (1\u2212 1\u2212 e\n\u2212\u03bb\u02c62\n\u03bb\u02c62\n) (16)\nA term-by-term comparison shows that pi(w\u02c62) > pi(w1) for any w1 \u2264 w\u00af since \u03bb\u02c62 \u2265 \u03bb(w1),\nw1 > u1 and the third term follows after some algebra. The preceding argument proves that\nthere is no equilibrium when w\u22172 = w\u02c62. As a result, for an equilibrium to exist, high wage\nfirms need to post w\u22172 = w\u00af. Furthermore, that wage is profit maximizing only if w\u00af > w\u02c62.\nTurning to the problem of a low wage firm we first calculate its retention probability.\nEquation (4) implies that \u03c8(w) = p(w\u00af) for wages that are posted in equilibrium (w \u2208 WF ).\n19\nFor wages outside the support of F it is determined by the response of workers to the firms\u2019\ntrembles, as discussed in section 2, which could potentially yield a different number. However,\nit can be (and will be) shown that the set of wages solving the low wage firm\u2019s problem can\nbe characterized completely by the case \u03c8(w) = p(w\u00af) \u2200 w < w\u00af. Since these complications\nare of a technical nature and do not help to understand the underlying trade-offs we deal\nwith them in the proof of the proposition below. The problem of a low wage firm is\nmax\nw\u2208[0,w\u00af]\n[1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb(w)] [1 \u2212 p(w\u00af)] (1\u2212 w) (17)\ns.t. p(w) w = u1. (18)\nNote that the retention probability enters the maximization problem as a constant, and\nhence it does not affect any decision of a low wage firm. As before, we rearrange (18) to get\nw = u1\/p(w) and substitute it into the objective function which becomes\nmax\n\u03bb\u2264\u03bb\u00af\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb u1) [1\u2212 p(w\u00af)]. (19)\nOnce more, the problem is strictly concave and admits a unique solution, \u03bb\u22171, corresponding\nto some w\u22171. Proposition 3.2 ensures that low wage firms cannot be posting the same wage\nas high wage firms in equilibrium and hence w\u22171 < w\u00af = w\n\u2217\n2. As a result, w\n\u2217\n1 is characterized\nby the low wage firm\u2019s first order conditions. Furthermore, since every low wage firm faces\nthe same problem they all post w\u22171.\nFigure 2 presents a graphical illustration of the above results. The two isoprofit curves\nyield the same expected profits to high and low wage firms. Note that they do not need to\nintersect since the retention probability is different for the two types of firms. For profits\nto be equalized across the two types of firms w\u02c62 is necessarily below w\u00af which means that a\nhigh wage firm would like to post w\u02c62, but this would place it in the low application area.\nTherefore, the strict concavity of the profit function implies that the optimal strategy for a\nhigh wage firm is to post the lowest wage that allows it to receive a high wage application,\n20\ni.e. w\u22172 = w\u00af.\nWage\nQueue \nLength\nIC-L\nIC-H\nw\u01752\nIP-H IP-H\u2019\nIP-L\n\u01751\nFigure 2: Firms\u2019 equilibrium behavior. IP-H and IP-L are the isoprofit curves for high and low wage firms.\nThe result that all firms of the same type post the same wage extends existing results in a\nnatural way: conditional on attracting a particular type of applications, firms compete with\neach other in the same way as in the single application case (e.g. Burdett, Shi and Wright\n(2001)) which exhibits a unique equilibrium wage.15 The only difference is that now there are\nadditional boundary conditions which delineate the type of applications (high or low) that a\nfirm receives. The following proposition summarizes the result and deals with the technical\nissue described earlier.\nProposition 3.3 In equilibrium, all high wage firms post w\u00af and all low wage firms post\nw\u02c61 \u2208 (u1, w\u00af) which is characterized by the first order conditions.\nProof. We only need to show that assuming \u03c8(w) = p(w\u00af) \u2200 w < w\u00af was without loss of\ngenerality. Recall that \u03c8(w) = p(w\u22172) for w \u2208 [0, w\u00af) \u2229WF . Now, consider the case where the\nworker strategies are such that \u03c8(w) takes different values in [0, w\u00af). An example of why this\ncould happen is the following. Suppose that one of the pairs of wages that the workers ran-\ndomize over in response to every perturbed distribution is (w\u02dc1, w\u02dc2) where w\u02dc2 = 1. If workers\n15We should add that Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001) only look for equilibria in which a single wage is\nposted, i.e. equilibria in symmetric strategies for firms. However, in Galenianos and Kircher (2006) we\nshow that even when considering the possibility of firms following asymmetric strategies, there do not exist\nequilibria with wage dispersion when agents are homogeneous.\n21\napplying to w\u02dc1 send their high wage application to w\u02dc2 only, then the retention probability at\nw\u02dc1 is very high since w\u02dc2 = 1 implies that p(w\u02dc2) has to be very low. As the trembles become\nsmaller, the probability that this particular pair is chosen converges to zero if w\u02dc1 or w\u02dc2 are\nnot offered in the limit, however \u03c8\u000f(w\u02dc1) remains equal to p(w\u02dc2) and so it converges to a\nrelatively low value. This would be troublesome if a different equilibrium could be supported\nin the way described. Suppose that there is such an equilibrium in which low wage firms post\nsome w\u02dc 6= w\u02c61. For w\u02dc to be posted it needs to provide the highest possible profits, implying\nin particular that pi(w\u02dc) \u2265 pi(w\u02c61). The last inequality can only hold if \u03c8(w\u02c61) > \u03c8(w\u02dc) since\n{w\u02c61} = argmax(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb(w)) (1 \u2212 w). However, the fact that w\u02dc is actually posted means\nthat \u03c8(w\u02dc) = p(w\u22172). Moreover, w\n\u2217\n2 = w\u00af implies that p(w) \u2264 p(w\u22172) for all wages w in the\nhigh region and hence \u03c8(w\u02dc) = p(w\u22172) \u2265 \u03c8(w\u02c61), yielding a contradiction. Therefore no other\nequilibrium can be supported. This completes the proof of proposition 3.3.\nIt is now easy to see that the density of posted wages is falling. Each wage level receives one\napplication per worker so \u03bb(w\u2217i ) = b\/di where di is the fraction of firms posting w\n\u2217\ni . d1 > d2\nfollows from Lemma 2.1 which established that the queue length is strictly increasing with\nthe wage rate. Note that having an increasing queue length is not sufficient for a decreasing\ndensity: we also use the result that each wage level receives the same number of applications.\nIf workers would send more applications to high-wage than to low-wage firms, then one could\nend up with an increasing queue length and an increasing density. In section 5.2 we discuss\nusing directed search leads to a decreasing density, in contrast to models of random search.\nProposition 3.4 The distribution of posted wages is decreasing, i.e., d1 > d2.\nProof. See above.\nTurning to the existence of equilibrium, we need to find the \u2018correct\u2019 fraction of firms to\npost each wage so that profits are equalized across types of firms and the necessary conditions\nwe derived earlier are satisfied. Formally, an equilibrium exists if there is {d1, d2} such that\n22\nd1+d2 = 1 and there is no profitable deviation when w\n\u2217\ni is posted by di firms, where w\n\u2217\n1 = w\u02c61\nand w\u22172 = w\u00af. The equilibrium is unique when there is a single pair of di\u2019s that satisfies these\nconditions.\nProposition 3.5 An equilibrium exists and it is unique.\nProof. We first show that w\u02c61 and w\u00af maximize the profits of the two types of firms. We then\nfix w\u22171 = w\u02c61 and w\n\u2217\n2 = w\u00af and find the dis that lead to equal profits across firms.\nTo prove that w\u22172 = w\u00af we need to show that w\u00af > w\u02c62 holds. Suppose that all high\nfirms post w\u00af and compare their profits with what they would earn had they all posted w\u02c62,\ndisregarding feasibility and optimality for now. Under both possible wages each firm receives\nthe same number of applications (one per worker) and hence the level of profits is completely\ndetermined by level of wages. If w\u00af < w\u02c62, then high wage firms would make higher profits if\nthey could coordinate to post the lower wage (of course, this will not occur in equilibrium\nsince each individual firm has an incentive to deviate to w\u02c62). Similarly, if w\u00af > w\u02c62, then\nhigh wage firms make lower profits by posting w\u00af. Recall that when high wage firms post w\u02c62\nthey earn higher profits than low wage firms and note that their profits would be lowered by\nposting w\u00af only if w\u00af > w\u02c62. This means that if we can show that profits are equalized across\nthe two types of firms when all high wage firms post w\u00af then it must be the case that w\u00af > w\u02c62.\nAs a result, equalizing profits also proves that w\u02c62 is not a feasible wage for high wage firms.\nFor low wage firms, it is easy to see that since w\u02c61 is derived by their first order condition it\nalso maximizes their profits.\nThe next step is to prove that profits can be equalized across the different types of\nfirms. To simplify notation let pii = pi(w\n\u2217\ni ), pi = p(w\n\u2217\ni ), p\u02dci1 = pi1\/(1 \u2212 p2), and \u03bb\u2217i = b\/di.\nWe first show that given some arbitrary d1 \u2208 (0, 1) we can find a d2 \u2208 (0, d1) such that\n\u2206pi(d2; d1) \u2261 p\u02dci1 \u2212 pi2\/(1 \u2212 p2) = 0. Setting the first order conditions of (19) to zero yields\nw\u22171 = \u03bb\n\u2217\n1 e\n\u2212\u03bb\u22171\/(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u22171) leading to p\u02dci1 = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u22171 \u2212 \u03bb\u22171 e\u2212\u03bb\u22171 . Furthermore, w\u22172 = w\u00af means\nthat p2 w\n\u2217\n2 = u1 \u21d2 w\u22172 = w\u22171 p1\/p2. Inserting that expression into the profit equation we get\npi2 = 1\u2212e\u2212\u03bb\u22172\u2212\u03bb\u22172 e\u2212\u03bb\u22171 . Evaluating \u2206pi(d2; d1) at the two limits of its domain yields different\n23\nsigns. Note that the queue lengths are the same when d2 = d1, which means that p1 = p2,\nw\u22171 = w\n\u2217\n2, and p\u02dci1 = pi2 leading to \u2206pi(d1; d1) < 0. On the other hand, \u03bb2 \u2192\u221e when d2 \u2192 0\nwhich means that p2 \u2192 0 and therefore w\u22172 \u2192\u221e leading to pi2 < 0 (this occurs because the\nhigh wage firm is assumed to post w\u00af). As a result \u2206pi(d2; d1) > 0 when d2 \u2248 0, and by the\nintermediate value theorem there exists a d2(d1) such that high and low wage firms make the\nsame profits.\nTo prove the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium when N = 2 we show that d1 and\nd2(d1) are positively related along the isoprofit curve, and hence there is a unique pair that\nequalizes profits and sums up to one. Implicit differentiation of d2 with respect to d1 while\nkeeping profits equal yields \u2202d2\/\u2202d1 = \u2212(\u2202\u2206pi\/\u2202d1)\/(\u2202\u2206pi\/\u2202d2). Some algebra shows that\nthe numerator is given by \u2202\u2206pi\/\u2202d1 = (\u2202\u03bb\n\u2217\n1\/\u2202d1) e\n\u2212\u03bb\u22171 (\u03bb\u22171 \u2212 \u03bb\u22172\/(1 \u2212 p2)), which is positive\nsince the queue length is inversely related to the number of firms and \u03bb\u22171 < \u03bb\n\u2217\n2. The denomi-\nnator is equal to \u2202\u2206pi\/\u2202d2 = \u2212pi2\u2202[1\/(1\u2212 p2)]\/\u2202d2 \u2212 [\u2202pi2\/\u2202d2]\/(1\u2212 p2). When di increases\nthe queue length decreases and hence the probability of getting a job increases. Therefore the\nfirst partial is positive and the first term as a whole is strictly negative. The second partial\nis also negative because the constraint of high wage firms binds and hence \u2202pi2\/\u2202\u03bb2 < 0.\nThis proves that \u2202d2\/\u2202d1 > 0. Hence if we start with d1 < 1\/2 we have d1 + d2(d1) < 1 and\nby increasing d1 we eventually find the unique {d1, d2} pair such that profits are equal and\nd1 + d2 = 1.\nAt this point it should be remarked that the only property of the trembling distribution,\nF\u02dc , that we used in solving the model is that it has full support. As a result, the unique\nequilibrium that was constructed survives any choice of F\u02dc .\n3.3 Efficiency\nWe now examine the efficiency properties of the equilibrium. We ask whether a planner can\ngenerate higher output by providing instructions to the workers about which jobs to apply\n24\nfor subject to the matching frictions in the market.16 As described in section 2, frictions are\nintroduced by restricting attention to symmetric strategies for workers so we constrain the\nplanner to do the same. The main result of this section is that constrained efficiency does\nnot obtain.\nMaximizing output in our environment is equivalent to maximizing the number of matches.\nBy definition, the number of matches is equal to the number of workers that become em-\nployed, as well as the number of vacancies that are filled. The probability that a worker\nbecomes employed equals the probability of receiving at least one job offer. The difference\nto the standard analysis with one application is that we have to account for the possibility\nthat a single worker obtains several offers.\nWe showed that in equilibrium a worker sends each of his applications to a different group\nof firms, which was identified by its distinct wage. A simple way to prove that the matching\nprocess is inefficient is to show that output can be increased by reallocating firms between\nthe two groups. We ignore wages since they have no bearing on aggregate welfare. Consider\nan arbitrary b and let d be the fraction of firms in the first group and 1 \u2212 d the fraction in\nthe second group. The following proposition states the result.\nProposition 3.6 When N = 2 the number of matches is maximized only if d = 1\/2 or\nd \u2208 {0, 1}.\nProof. See the appendix.\nThe proposition shows that it may be optimal for workers to send only one application\ndue to congestion. In that event the planner\u2019s solution is to place all firms in one group\n(d \u2208 {0, 1}). If it is optimal to send two applications, then the number of firms should be\nequal in both groups. However, we know that in equilibrium the number of firms posting the\nlow wage is larger and hence this efficiency condition is never met. Moreover, since the lack of\nefficiency arises from the matching process it carries over even if the number of applications\n16For further discussion of this approach see e.g. Shimer (2005).\n25\nis endogenized or if the ratio of workers to firms is determined by free entry subject to a fixed\ncost.\nIt is worthwhile to mention that efficiency does obtain in the usual directed search envi-\nronment with one application. The reason is that firms can price the arrival rate (in essence,\nthe queue length) of workers through the wages they post.17 When workers send multiple\napplications firms care about the probability of retaining a worker, as well as the arrival rate\nof applicants. The arrival rate can still be priced using the posted wage, but the probability\nof retaining a worker does not depend on how many applications a firm has received: if a\nfirm\u2019s chosen applicant has a better offer, the firm remains idle regardless of how many other\nworkers it attracted. Therefore, the arrival rate of applicants does not change the probability\nof hiring at the second stage, once at least one worker has applied. Since the firm can only\ninfluence the arrival rate of workers but not the retention probability, it cannot fully price\nits hiring probability and hence efficiency does not obtain.\nInterestingly, Kircher (2007) finds that constrained efficiency is restored when firms can\nrecall all the applicants they receive, in an otherwise similar model. In that environment, the\nsecond phase of the hiring process also depends on the queue length since a firm can offer\nthe job to all the applicants it receives, until one of them accepts (or all of them reject it).\nThis is consistent with the intuition that if firms are able to price their full hiring probability\nthen efficiency obtains. However, if firms can only recall up to a certain (finite) number of\napplicants, the queue length will only partially influence the retention probability. Hence it\nis our conjecture that efficiency fails when recall is imperfect. Therefore, we believe that our\ninefficiency result can be seen as a general feature of limited recall.\n4 The General Case: N \u2265 2\nWe turn to the model with a general N . The analysis mirrors the one of section 3 and we\nprove that all results except for uniqueness generalize in a straightforward manner. While\n17See Mortensen and Wright (2002) for a discussion.\n26\nwe believe that the equilibrium is unique we have been unable to prove so and we describe\nthe difficulties involved in section 4.2. In our working paper version (Galenianos and Kircher\n(2005)) we present some numerical evidence of uniqueness.\nFigure 3 illustrates the distribution of posted and received wages for an economy with\nequal number of workers and firms and N = 15. Properties of the distribution of wages are\nexplored in the next section.\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\nWAGE\nM\nEA\nSU\nR\nE \nO\nF \nFI\nR\nM\nS\nWages Offered \n              \nWages Accepted\n              \n              \nFigure 3: Equilibrium wage dispersion for N = 15 and b = 1.\n4.1 Worker Optimization\nRecall thatW iG is the set of wages that receive the ith application of workers. As before, the\nutility of the lowest i applications has to be the same in any N -tuple of wages which defines\nthe following recursive relationship\nui = p(wi) wi + (1\u2212 p(wi)) ui\u22121, \u2200 wi \u2208 W iG, i \u2208 {1, 2, ...N}, (20)\nwhere u0 \u2261 0. The fact that p(w) is strictly decreasing together with the convention wi \u2265 wi\u22121\nimply that ui > ui\u22121. Moreover, ui is the highest possible utility a worker can get from i appli-\ncations when his fallback option is ui\u22121. Let w\u00afi be the highest wage that provides total utility\n27\nequal to ui when the fallback option is ui\u22121, i.e w\u00afi = max{w|p(w) w+ (1\u2212 p(w)) ui\u22121 = ui}.\nLet w\u00af0 be the lowest wage that receives applications with positive probability. Proposition\n3.1 is generalized as follows.\nProposition 4.1 When a worker sends N applications optimally, w \u2208 W iG implies that\nw \u2208 [w\u00afi\u22121, w\u00afi] for i \u2208 {1, 2, ...N}.\nProof. The proof is by induction. It is sufficient to show that the following property holds\nfor all i: w < w\u00afi \u21d2 w \/\u2208 WkG for k \u2265 i + 1. The initial step for i = 1 was proven in the\nprevious section, where w\u00af1 = w\u00af. We assume that the property holds for i\u2212 1 and show that\na contradiction is reached if it does not hold for i. In other words, if w < w\u00afi\u22121 \u21d2 w \u2208 W i\u22121G\nholds, then there is no w\u02dc \u2208 W i+1G such that w\u02dc < w\u00afi (if w\u02dc \u2208 WkG for k > i + 1 the same\nargument goes through). Define v(w, ui\u22121) = p(w) w + (1 \u2212 p(w)) ui\u22121 to be the utility of\napplying to a particular wage w when the fallback option is ui\u22121. We want to show that\nv(w\u00afi, ui) > v(w\u02dc, ui) for all w\u02dc < w\u00afi. Note that\nv(w\u02dc, ui\u22121) = p(w\u02dc) w\u02dc + (1\u2212 p(w\u02dc)) ui\u22121\n\u2264 p(w\u00afi) w\u00afi + (1\u2212 p(w\u00afi)) ui\u22121 = v(w\u00afi, ui\u22121),\nsince the second line is the optimal choice when ui\u22121 is the fallback option and hence it\nprovides with the maximum level of utility. Replacing ui\u22121 with ui in both lines above we\nget the terms to be compared. Since w\u00afi > w\u02dc \u21d2 (1 \u2212 p(w\u00afi)) > (1 \u2212 p(w\u02dc)) the second term\nincreases by more and the inequality becomes strict which proves the result.\nAn implication of the proposition is that the queue lengths facing the firms attracting the\nith application are given by the following expression\np(w) w + (1\u2212 p(w)) ui\u22121 = ui, \u2200 w \u2208 [w\u00afi\u22121, w\u00afi], (21)\n28\nwhich is a straightforward generalization of equations (9) and (10).\n4.2 Firm Optimization\nWe now turn to the first stage of the model. For the remainder of the paper firms that receive\nthe ith lowest application of workers are referred to as type i firms. The profit maximization\nproblem of each type of firm is solved and profits are then equalized across types.\nWhen posting a wage, a firm takes as given the cutoffs {w\u00afk}N\u22121k=0 and the equilibrium\nutility levels {uk}Nk=1, which determine the utility provided to workers for their lowest k\napplications. A firm of type i solves the following profit maximization problem:\nmax\nw\u2208[w\u00afi\u22121,w\u00afi]\nq(w) [1\u2212 \u03c8(w)] (1\u2212 w), (22)\nwhere the queue lengths are determined by equations (21).\nThe problem of a type N firm is identical to (12) with w\u00afN\u22121 replacing w\u00af and {uN\u22121, uN}\nreplacing {u1, u2}. Following the same logic it is shown that w\u00afN\u22121 is the solution to the\nproblem of type N firms. This means that \u03c8(w) = p(w\u00afN\u22121) for type N \u2212 1 firms and\ntheir maximization problem is, in turn, the same but with w\u00afN\u22122 as the lower cutoff and\n{uN\u22122, uN\u22121} as the relevant utility levels that determine the queue lengths. Again, this\nleads to w\u2217N\u22121 = w\u00afN\u22122 which implies that \u03c8(w) = [1\u2212 p(w\u00afN\u22121)] [1\u2212 p(w\u00afN\u22122)] for type N \u2212 3\nfirms and so on. In general, it will be shown that the retention probability of a type i firms\nis 1 \u2212 \u03c8(w) = \u220fNn=i+1[1 \u2212 p(w\u2217n)] \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03c8i and, given \u03c8i, the maximization problem for a\ntype i firm becomes\nmax\nw\u2208[w\u00afi\u22121,w\u00afi]\nq(w) [1 \u2212 \u03c8i] (1\u2212 w) (23)\ns.t. p(w) w + (1 \u2212 p(w)) ui\u22121 = ui. (24)\nTo generalize proposition 3.3 to any N it is sufficient to show that type i \u2265 2 firms make\nstrictly higher profits than firms of type i \u2212 1 unless w\u2217i = w\u00afi\u22121. Using the constraint (24)\n29\nto substitute for the wage in (23) and taking the first order conditions with respect to the\nqueue length, the profits of a type i firm are given by\npi(w\u02c6i) = (1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u2217i ) (1\u2212 ui\u22121) (1\u2212 \u03bb\n\u2217\ni e\n\u2212\u03bb\u2217i\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u2217i ) (1\u2212 \u03c8i). (25)\nThe profit of a type i\u2212 1 firm is given by\npi(wi\u22121) = (1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bbi\u22121) (1\u2212 wi\u22121) (1\u2212 1\u2212 e\n\u2212\u03bb\u2217i\n\u03bb\u2217i\n) (1\u2212 \u03c8i), (26)\nand it is strictly lower than pi(w\u02c6i) for the same reasons as in section 3.\nProposition 4.2 In equilibrium, all type i firms post the same wage w\u2217i = w\u00afi\u22121 for i \u2265 2.\nAll type 1 firms post w\u02c61 which it is determined by the first order conditions.\nProof. See above.\nSimilarly, it is straightforward to extend proposition 3.4 to show that the density of posted\nwages is again falling.\nProposition 4.3 The distribution of posted wages is decreasing, i.e., di > di+1 for all i \u2208\n{1, ..., N \u2212 1}.\nProof. We established that \u03bb(w\u2217i ) = b\/di, which is strictly increasing by lemma 2.1.\nTo establish existence of an equilibrium, we show that there is a sequence {d1, d2, ..., dN}\nsuch that d1 + d2 + ...+ dN = 1 and there is no profitable deviation when wage w\n\u2217\ni is posted\nby exactly di firms, where w\n\u2217\n1 = w\u02c61 and w\n\u2217\ni = w\u00afi\u22121 for i \u2265 2.\nProposition 4.4 An equilibrium exists for any N .\nProof. By an argument similar to proposition 3.5 it can be shown that when w\u2217i is posted by\nall type i firms, then w\u2217i is indeed profit maximizing. We now show that there is a sequence\n30\n{di}Ni=1 such that when w\u2217i = w\u00afi\u22121 is posted by di firms and the d1 lowest wage firms post\nthe wage w\u22171 = w\u02c61 given by their first order condition the profits of all types of firms can be\nequalized. Recall the notation of proposition 3.5 and generalize it by defining p\u02dcii = pii\/(1\u2212\u03c8i)\nand \u2206pii(di|di\u22121) \u2261 p\u02dcii\u22121 \u2212 p\u02dcii\/(1 \u2212 pi). For equal profits across types it is sufficient to show\nthat pii = pii\u22121 for all i, which is the same as \u2206pii(di|di\u22121) = 0 since the term (1 \u2212 \u03c8i) is\ncommon to both sides. We show that given a di\u22121 we can find a di \u2208 (0, di\u22121) such that\n\u2206pii(di|di\u22121) = 0. This allows us to construct a sequence of dis such that all firms make the\nsame profits for an arbitrary initial d1. We then show that we can find such a sequence of\ndi\u2019s with elements that sum to one.\nRecall the following two equations (for i \u2265 2 with u0 = 0).\nui\u22121 = pi\u22121 w\u2217i\u22121 + (1\u2212 pi\u22121) ui\u22122 (27)\nui\u22121 = pi w\u2217i + (1\u2212 pi) ui\u22122. (28)\nEquation (27) holds by the definition of ui\u22121. Equation (28) holds because w\u2217i = w\u00afi\u22121 and\nhence the i firm has to provide the same utility as w\u2217i\u22121 if it is used for the i \u2212 1 lowest\napplication.\nUsing these two equations it is not hard to show that \u2206pii(di\u22121; di\u22121) < 0 and \u2206pii(0; di\u22121) >\n0 for the same reasons as in proposition 3.5. Therefore there is a di(di\u22121) such that type i\nand i\u2212 1 firms make the same profits. Moreover, the solution di(di\u22121) is unique if\n\u2202\u2206pii\n\u2202di\n= \u2212p\u02dcii \u2202(1\/(1\u2212 pi))\n\u2202di\n\u2212 1\n1\u2212 pi\n\u2202p\u02dcii\n\u2202di\n< 0. (29)\nWe now show that this inequality holds. The first term is strictly negative because a higher\ndi leads to lower queue length and hence a higher probability of receiving a job offer.\nDetermining that the second term is negative is somewhat more involved. It will prove\n31\nconvenient to rewrite the profits of a type i firm as\npii = (1\u2212 \u03c8i) [(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bbi) (1\u2212 ui\u22122)\u2212 \u03bbi (ui\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22122)] (30)\nusing proposition 4.2 and equations (23) and (28). Differentiating that expression with\nrespect to di yields\n\u2202pii\n\u2202di\n= (1\u2212 \u03c8i) \u2202\u03bbi\n\u2202di\n[e\u2212\u03bbi (1\u2212 ui\u22122)\u2212 (ui\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22122)] (31)\nTo determine that the term inside the square brackets is negative we use the first order\nconditions of an individual firm with respect to its queue length\n(1\u2212 \u03c8i) [e\u2212\u03bbi (1\u2212 ui\u22121)\u2212 (ui \u2212 ui\u22121)] < 0, (32)\nwhere the sign results from proposition 4.2. Putting these two expressions together yields\ne\u2212\u03bbi (1\u2212 ui\u22122)\u2212 (ui\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22122) < e\u2212\u03bbi (1\u2212 ui\u22121)\u2212 (ui \u2212 ui\u22121) < 0 (33)\nwhere the first inequality results from noting that ui \u2212 ui\u22121 = (1 \u2212 pi) (ui\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22122) due to\nequations (27) and (28). Then (31) yields \u2202pii\/\u2202di > 0 since \u2202\u03bbi\/\u2202di < 0, which proves the\ninequality in equation (29).\nSince di(di\u22121) is unique, for a given d1 the sequence d2(d1), d3(d2(d1)), ... can be uniquely\nconstructed such that all types of firms make the same profits. To find the sequence whose\nelements sum up to one define S(d1) \u2261\n\u2211N\ni=1 di(d1) and note that it is continuous since all of\nits components vary continuously with d1. Moreover, S(1\/N) < 1 since di(di\u22121) < di\u22121 and\nS(1) > 1 so there is some d\u22171 such that S(d\n\u2217\n1) = 1 and an equilibrium exists for any N .\nShowing that the equilibrium is unique has proved elusive. In Galenianos and Kircher\n(2005), given N , we reduce the uniqueness problem to the analysis of a one-dimensional\n32\nfunction and provide numerical evidence that the equilibrium is unique for a wide range of\nparameter values. Furthermore, we have not encountered any multiplicities in any parameter\nregions. The difficulties in analytically proving uniqueness arises because the equilibrium\nwages are determined by the endogenous constraints imposed by lower wage firms rather\nthan the first order conditions of the profit function. This complicates the task of finding the\nequilibrium measures of firms across types since we cannot rely on envelop-type arguments.\nFor instance, increasing the measure of low wage firms has ambiguous effects on the profits\nof high wage firms because it affects the constraints under which they are operating and\nthese are a complicated function of the changes at the lower wages. These difficulties are\nmanageable when N = 2 but the lack of tractability of the general case does not allow us to\nprove uniqueness in general.\n4.3 Efficiency\nWe now show how to extend the efficiency results of Section 3.3 to a general number N of\napplications.\nIn equilibrium, a worker sends each of his N applications to a different group of firms,\ndistinguished by its wage wi. Let pi = p(wi) and let d = {d1, d2, ..., dN} be the equilibrium\nvector of the fraction of firms within each group. The total number of matches is given by\nb m(d) where m(d) \u2261 1\u2212\u220fNi=1 (1\u2212 pi) is the probability that a particular worker receives a\njob offer. Observe that m(d) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 pk) (1\u2212 pl)\n\u220f\ni6=k,l (1\u2212 pi), given any two groups of\nfirms, k and l. Therefore, an equilibrium is constrained efficient only if dk and dl minimize\n(1\u2212 pk) (1\u2212 pl), which is equivalent to\nmax\ndk,dl\u22650\n(pk + pl \u2212 pk pl) (34)\ns.t. dk + dl = 1\u2212\n\u2211\ni6=k,l\ndi.\nThis problem is identical to the case of only two applications per each worker in an economy\n33\nwith a measure 1 \u2212\u2211i6=k,l di of firms (which by constant returns in the matching function\nis equivalent to an economy with a unit measure of firms and a worker-firm ratio given by\nb\/(1 \u2212\u2211i6=k,l di)). Proposition 3.6 proves that the equilibrium number of matches is not\nconstrained efficient.\n5 The Distribution of Wages\nIn this section we investigate some properties of the distribution of wages. We examine the\nshape of the empirical distribution and how its tail varies with labor market tightness. We\nalso contrast our results with those of random search models.\n5.1 The Empirical Distribution\nA well-known stylized fact of the labor market is that the empirical density of wages is\ndecreasing. So far we have shown that the density of posted wages is decreasing. We prove\nthat the density of received wages is decreasing everywhere so long as the worker-firm ratio\nis not too small. This is not an immediate result because higher wages are accepted more\noften.\nProposition 5.1 The distribution of received wages is decreasing when the ratio of workers\nto firms is large enough.\nProof. The measure of workers who are employed at wage w\u2217i is given by b (1\u2212\u03c8i+1) pi \u2261 Ei.\nMoreover, Ei\u22121 = b (1 \u2212 \u03c8i) pi\u22121 = b (1 \u2212 \u03c8i+1) (1 \u2212 pi) pi\u22121. The density to be declin-\ning, i.e. Ei < Ei\u22121, if and only if pi < (1 \u2212 pi) pi\u22121 for all i. Equal profits imply that\nq(w\u2217i ) (1\u2212w\u2217i ) = q(w\u2217i\u22121) (1\u2212 pi) (1\u2212w\u2217i\u22121) or pi \u03bbi (1\u2212w\u2217i ) = pi\u22121 \u03bbi\u22121 (1\u2212 pi) (1\u2212w\u2217i\u22121)\nyielding the condition \u03bbi (1 \u2212 w\u2217i ) > \u03bbi\u22121 (1 \u2212 w\u2217i\u22121). Using the equilibrium conditions\nw\u2217i = (ui\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22122)\/pi + ui\u22121 and w\u2217i\u22121 = (ui\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22122)\/pi\u22121 + ui\u22121 the inequality becomes\n\u03bbi(1\u2212 x\/pi) > \u03bbi\u22121(1\u2212 x\/pi\u22121) where x \u2261 (ui\u22121\u2212 ui\u22122)\/(1\u2212 ui\u22122). Therefore, the empirical\n34\ndistribution is decreasing if g(\u03bb) \u2261 \u03bb (1 \u2212 \u03bb x\/(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb)) is increasing with respect to the\nqueue length. The first derivative yields \u2202g\/\u2202\u03bb = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb) (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb \u2212 2 \u03bb x) + \u03bb2 x e\u2212\u03bb\nwhich is positive if \u03bb x is small. Noting that \u03bbi x = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bbi) (w\u2217i \u2212 ui\u22122)\/(1 \u2212 ui\u22122) and\nthat the right hand side goes to zero for b large enough establishes the result.\nA further observation of empirical interest is that the tail of the received wage distribution\nis thicker when b is lower. This is an immediate implication of the previous result and the\nfollowing observation that the density in the tail of the received wage distribution is increasing\nwhen b is small. Since small b (few workers relative to firms) implies that the unemployment\nrate at the end of the interaction is low, this also implies that the thickness of the tail\ndecreases in the unemployment level.\nProposition 5.2 The tail of the distribution of received wages is increasing when the ratio\nof workers to firms is sufficiently small.\nProof. Recalling the notation from the previous proof, increasing distribution in the tail\nmeans EN > EN\u22121 or pN > (1\u2212 pN) pN\u22121. When b is small pi > (1\u2212 pi)pi\u22121 has to hold for\nsome i, as it is implied by pi larger 1\/2. We use this as the induction anchor. If this implies\npi+1 > (1 \u2212 pi+1)pi, the result holds by induction. The proof proceeds by contradiction.\nAssume pi+1 \u2264 (1 \u2212 pi+1)pi. Dividing each side of the induction anchor by the respective\nside of this inequality yields after rearranging pi >\n(1\u2212pi)\/pi\n(1\u2212pi+1)\/pi+1pi\u22121. We know pi < pi\u22121, and\npi+1 < pi implies (1\u2212 pi)\/pi < (1\u2212 pi+1)\/pi+1, which yield the desired contradiction.\n5.2 The Wage Density under Directed vs. Random Search\nWe now compare the predictions of our model concerning the shape of the wage density with\nthose of random search models. As already noted, our model predicts a decreasing density of\nposted and (under certain parameter restrictions) received wages, which is in accordance with\ndata (see Mortensen (2003)). Models of random search typically predict that the density of\n35\nwages is increasing. We argue that it is precisely the directedness of the search process that\nleads to the desirable results about the shape of the wage distribution and we use a random\nsearch version of our model to illustrate this point.\nConsider a version of our model where search is random rather than directed. Firms post\nwages, but they cannot communicate them to workers. A worker sends N applications at\nrandom to as many firms. Each firm chooses one of its applicants at random to make a job\noffer at the posted wage, and workers with multiple offers accept the most desirable job. In\nour terminology, there is ex post but not ex ante competition among firms. This environ-\nment is examined in Gautier and Moraga-Gonza\u00b4les (2005) and it leads to wage dispersion,\nsince posting a higher wage results in hiring a worker who has additional offers with greater\nprobability.\nDenote the probability that a worker gets an offer by p\u00af, and the probability that a firm\nhas at least one applicant by q\u00af. Note that since the arrival rate of workers is independent of\nthe posted wage, these outcomes do not depend on the wage but only on b. Let F be the\ndistribution of posted wages and first consider the N = 2 case. The probability that a firm\nhires a worker is given by q\u00af [1\u2212 p\u00af + p\u00af F (w)]. The first term is the probability that at least\none worker applies, while the second term is the probability that this worker has no other\noffer or his other offer is for a lower wage. Equal profits imply that the following condition\nhas to hold for all w \u2208 suppF :\nq\u00af (1\u2212 p\u00af+ p\u00af F (w)) (1\u2212 w) = \u03a0\n\u21d4 q\u00af (1\u2212 p\u00af+ p\u00af F (w)) = \u03a0\n1\u2212 w,\nwhere 1 \u2212 w is the margin of the firm and \u03a0 denotes the equilibrium level of profits. Note\nthat \u03a0\/(1\u2212w) is a strictly convex function of w and that F (w) is the only non-constant on\nthe left hand side of the equation above. As a result, equal profits imply that the distribution\nof posted wages has to be strictly convex.\n36\nThe intuition behind this result is that when moving upwards on the support of F , the\npercentage decrease in the margin becomes larger at an increasing rate. For profits to remain\nconstant, this requires an equivalent increase in the probability of hiring. In a random\nsearch environment, a higher wage firm increases its hiring probability only by getting more\nworkers who might have different offers, i.e. only the ex post competition margin improves.\nThis means that, when moving to the top of the distribution, a firm needs to \u2018overtake\u2019 an\nincreasing number of competing firms or, in other words, the distribution of wages needs to\nbe convex. The same reasoning holds for arbitrary N , in which case the profits are given by\nq\u00af (1\u2212 p\u00af\u2212 p\u00af F (w))N\u22121 (1\u2212 w) (see Gautier and Moraga-Gonza\u00b4les (2005)).\nFigure 4 shows the wage density under random search for N = 15 and equal number of\nworkers and firms, which allows a comparison with figure 3 for directed search.\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7w\nW\nA\nG\nE\n D\nE\nN\nS\nIT\nY\nWAGE\nOffered wage\nAccepted wage\nFigure 4: Wage densities with random search, for N = 15 and b = 1.\nIn a directed search environment a decreasing wage profile is possible due to the presence\nof ex ante competition: the ability of firms to attract more applicants by posting a higher wage\ngives an additional channel through which they increase the probability of hiring. Therefore,\nhigh wage firms need not \u2018overtake\u2019 as many of their competitors to guarantee equal profits.\n37\n6 Extensions\nThe main insights developed above carry over when we allow for free entry, for endogenous\ndecisions concerning the number of applications, and for a dynamic labor market interaction.\nThis section discusses each case in turn.\n6.1 Free Entry\nConsider a large number of potential firms, each of which can pay a fixed cost K < 1 to\nenter the labor market. The number of applications that each worker sends is fixed at N .\nLet \u03a0(b) denote the equilibrium profits of firms when the worker-firm ratio is b. \u03a0(b) is\na correspondence in the case of multiple equilibria. It is easy to see that limb\u2192\u221e\u03a0(b) =\n1, limb\u21920\u03a0(b) = 0. Any intermediate payoff is attainable as an equilibrium payoff: If the\nequilibria are unique then \u03a0(b) is continuous and the intermediate value theorem applies;\nfor the case of multiple equilibria we prove a version of the intermediate value theorem in\nthe appendix. Therefore, there is some b\u2217 > 0 such that the equilibrium profits are exactly\nequal to K. Our results about the distribution of wages and the efficiency of the application\nprocess are not affected by free entry since they were derived for an arbitrary number of\nfirms.\n6.2 Endogenous Number of Applications\nWe introduce a choice for the workers of how many applications to send, subject to a cost\nper application c. The ensuing game evolves as outlined in section 2 and attention is again\nrestricted to symmetric equilibria where every worker sends the same number of applications\nin expectation. Recall that ui is the maximum payoff a worker receives when applying i\ntimes. To determine the marginal benefit of the ith application note that in equilibrium for\n38\ni \u2265 2\nui = pi w\n\u2217\ni + (1\u2212 pi) ui\u22121 (35)\nui\u22121 = pi w\u2217i + (1\u2212 pi) ui\u22122, (36)\nwhere the first expression holds by the definition of ui and the second holds because w\n\u2217\ni = w\u00afi\u22121\nand hence w\u2217i \u2208 W i\u22121. Subtracting (36) from (35), the marginal benefit of the ith application\nis given by ui\u2212ui\u22121 = (1\u2212 pi) (ui\u22121\u2212ui\u22122) =\n\u220fi\nj=2(1\u2212 pj) u1. Clearly, the marginal benefit\nof an additional application is decreasing in i and therefore uN \u2212 uN\u22121 > c is a sufficient\ncondition for workers to send at least N applications. Moreover, since uN \u2212 uN\u22121 is strictly\npositive, the equilibrium does not unravel with the introduction of small costs of search.18\nIf costs are in [(1 \u2212 pN) (uN \u2212 uN\u22121), uN \u2212 uN\u22121] workers are willing to send exactly N\napplications because the additional benefit of sending the N + 1 application (to the most\nattractive wage, which is the highest wage) does not cover the costs. For some parameter\nvalues the costs might not fall in any such interval, in which case one has to investigate mixed\nstrategy equilibria in which some workers send N and others N + 1 applications.\n6.3 The Dynamic Version\nIt is relatively straightforward to extend our model to a dynamic setting where the agents\nwho were not matched can try again in the following period and matches break up at some\nexogenous rate. The one-shot deviation principle reveals that the stage game interaction\nhas the same trade-offs as our analysis, except for the fact that workers and firms now\nhave a positive (endogenous) outside option from not being matched. We derive the steady-\nstate equilibrium for this extension in the working paper version of our paper, Galenianos\nand Kircher (2005). A further extension would be to allow firms and workers to search\nfor cheaper labor or better jobs while being already involved in an ongoing employment\n18This is not the case in other labor models, e.g. Albrecht and Axell (1984).\n39\nrelationship. That requires an interesting merger of our portfolio choice problem with job\ntransitions explored in Delacroix and Shi (2006) that is beyond the scope of the present\npaper.\n7 Conclusions\nWe develop a directed search model where workers apply simultaneously for N jobs. We find\nthat all equilibria exhibit wage dispersion, with firms posting N different wages and workers\nsending one application to each distinct wage. The dispersion is driven by the portfolio\nchoice that workers face, and integrating this problem in an equilibrium framework is our\nmain theoretical contribution. The matching process is a source of inefficiency because higher\npaying firms fill their vacancies too often. This model delivers some potentially testable\npredictions. In line with stylized facts, the density of posted and, for suitable parameter\nvalues, received wages is decreasing, a result which is due to the directedness of the search\nprocess. Firms that post high wages receive more applications per vacancy than lower-wage\nfirms. A firm\u2019s job offer is not necessarily accepted, but higher-wage offers are accepted more\noften. While wage dispersion has been repeatedly examined in the literature, the last two\nimplications have not received much attention.\nAs noted in the introduction, Albrecht, Gautier and Vroman (2006) develop a directed\nsearch model where workers simultaneously apply for multiple jobs in an environment where\nfirms cannot commit to their wage offers. They characterize the unique equilibrium where a\nsingle wage is posted and show that it is equal to the workers\u2019 reservation value. Furthermore,\nthey show that the entry of firms is excessive from an efficiency viewpoint. We see our paper\nas complementary to theirs for a number of reasons. First, one might conjecture that their\ninefficiency result is due to the inability to price workers\u2019 applications appropriately under\nlack of commitment. The analysis of our alternative formulation shows that commitment\nalone is not the reason for the inefficiencies; rather they stem from the fact that a firm\u2019s wage\n40\nonly affects the applications it receives but not where workers additionally apply. Second,\nour formulation leads to wage dispersion with the desirable qualitative features described\nabove and, additionally, the extent of dispersion depends on the number of applications that\nworkers send in a non-trivial way. Finally, in terms of modeling assumptions, commitment\nto posted wages is based on the presumption that, in certain environments, a firm\u2019s offer to\na worker are non-verifiable by third parties which reduces the incentives to compete against\nother (potentially fictitious) offers.\nOur model can be extended in a number of ways, in addition to the ones described in\nsection 6. One possibility is to allow firms to post more general mechanisms, such as lotteries\nover the wage.19 Note that our results would not change if the lottery is played out after the\nworker\u2019s decision of which offer to accept, because workers would only consider the lottery\u2019s\nexpected value. If the lottery is played after the applications are sent but before workers\ndecide which offer to accept, then the equilibrium could be very different since the applicants\nwould need to take into account the entire distribution of each lottery in their portfolio. We\nleave the study of this possibility for future work.\nOther potentially interesting extensions include heterogeneity and risk aversion. The\nresults on the separation of applications do not hinge on firm homogeneity and hence they\nextend to the case of productivity differentials among firms. The firms\u2019 optimization problem\nwill be different, of course, and we conjecture that more productive firms will post higher\nwages since they have a higher opportunity cost of remaining idle. Moderate risk aversion\nof workers can be easily accommodated in our framework by replacing w with a concave\nfunction \u03bd(w) when specifying the worker\u2019s utility, leaving the worker\u2019s problem virtually\nunchanged and affecting the firms only by slightly modifying the equations that determine\nthe queue lengths.\n19Since all agents are homogeneous the only point of a more general mechanism would be to \u201csmooth\u201d\nnon-convexities induced by the kink in the workers reaction, illustrated in Figure 1.\n41\n8 Appendix\nProof of Proposition 3.6.\nThe planner solves the following problem: maxd\u2208[0,1] m(d) = p1 + p2 \u2212 p1 p2. The technical\ndifficulty arises because this problem is for some parameters neither globally convex nor\nconcave. We will establish that there is at most one interior maximum, and it arises at\nd = 1\/2. If the problem has an interior solution, the first order conditions yield\n\u2202p2\n\u2202d1\n(1\u2212 p1) + \u2202p1\n\u2202d1\n(1\u2212 p2) = 0. (37)\nRecalling that \u03bb1 = b\/(1 \u2212 d) and \u03bb2 = b\/d it is easy to see that equation (37) can be\nrewritten as (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb2e\u2212\u03bb2)(1 \u2212 1\u2212e\u2212\u03bb1\u03bb1 ) = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb1e\u2212\u03bb1)(1 \u2212 1\u2212e\n\u2212\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n) because\n\u2202pi\/\u2202d = \u2212\u2202\u03bbi\/\u2202d (1 \u2212 e\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbi e\u2212\u03bbi)\/\u03bb2i , \u2202\u03bb1\/\u2202d = b\/(1 \u2212 d)2 = \u03bb21\/b, and \u2202\u03bb2\/\u2202d =\n\u2212b\/d2 = \u2212\u03bb22\/b. It is immediate that one extremum occurs when \u03bb1 = \u03bb2, or d = 1\/2. The\nsecond derivative is given by\n\u22022m\n\u2202d2\n= 1\nb2\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb2e\u2212\u03bb2)(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb1e\u2212\u03bb1)\u2212 1b2\u03bb32e\u2212\u03bb2(1\u2212 p1)\n+ 1\nb2\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb2e\u2212\u03bb2)(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb1e\u2212\u03bb1)\u2212 1b2\u03bb31e\u2212\u03bb1(1\u2212 p2). (38)\nUsing the relations derived above and dividing by (1\u2212p1)(1\u2212p2)\/b2 establishes that the sign\nof the second derivative is given by sign(\u22022m\/\u2202d2) = sign(f(\u03bb2) + f(\u03bb1)) at all candidate\nextreme points, where\nf(\u03bb) =\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbe\u2212\u03bb)2\n(1\u2212 (1\u2212 e\u03bb)\/\u03bb)2 \u2212\n\u03bb3e\u2212\u03bb\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 e\u03bb)\/\u03bb. (39)\nTherefore, we want to show that there is no b > 0 such that there exists d \u2208 (1\/2, 1)\nwhere (37) holds and\nf(\nb\nd\n) + f(\nb\n1\u2212 d) \u2264 0. (40)\nFigure 5 shows f(\u03bb) for \u03bb \u2265 0. The function is strictly decreasing on (0, a1), strictly\nincreasing on (a1, a4), again strictly decreasing on (a4,\u221e) and converges to 1 for \u03bb \u2192 \u221e.\nThe only roots of the function are 0 and a2. We will discuss this function in order to establish\nthe result. Note that for any b, the specific value of d defines \u03bb1 = b\/d and \u03bb2 = b\/(1 \u2212 d).\nNote that for \u03bb2 > a3 it is not possible to fulfill (40), where a3 is such that f(a3) = \u2212f(a1).\nTherefore we will restrict the discussion to \u03bb2 < a3. This also implies that we do not have\nto discuss any b where 2b > a3. For d = 1\/2 we know that \u03bb1 = \u03bb2, and therefore the first\n42\norder condition holds and sign(\u22022m\/\u2202d2) = signf(2b).\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14x\nf(x)\na1 a2 a3 a4\nf(a1)\n-f(a1)\nFigure 5: f(x) for x \u2265 0.\nCASE 1: b \u2265 a2\/2. Then at d = 1\/2 we have 2f(2b) \u2265 0. Starting from d = 1\/2, i.e.\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2, we will increase d and thus spread \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 apart. We will show that there does\nnot exist d > 1\/2 such that (40) holds. Assume that (40) holds for the given b at some\nd > 1\/2. Then for any b\u2032 \u2208 [a2\/2, b) there exists a d\u2032 > 1\/2 such that (40) holds. This is\neasy to see if there exists d\u2032 > 1\/2 such that \u03bb1 = b\/d = b\u2032\/d\u2032 = \u03bb\u20321. Then f(\u03bb1) = f(\u03bb\n\u2032\n1).\nSince \u03bb2 = b\/1 \u2212 d) > b\u2032\/(1 \u2212 d\u2032) = \u03bb\u20322, f(\u03bb2) > f(\u03bb\u20322). But then f(\u03bb1) + f(\u03bb2) \u2264 0 implies\nf(\u03bb\u20321)+f(\u03bb\n\u2032\n2) < 0. If for some b\n\u2032 \u2208 [a2\/2, b) no such d\u2032 > 1\/2 exists, we reach a contradiction:\nThere is some b\u2032\u2032 \u2208 [b\u2032, b) such that at d\u2032\u2032 = 1\/2 it holds that \u03bb1 = b\/d = b\u2032\u2032\/d\u2032\u2032 = \u03bb\u20321. By the\nprior argument f(\u03bb\u2032\u20321) + f(\u03bb\n\u2032\u2032\n2) < 0, but this violates 2f(2b) = f(\u03bb\n\u2032\u2032\n1) + f(\u03bb\n\u2032\u2032\n2) \u2265 0. Therefore,\nif we know that (40) does not hold at b\u02dc = a2\/2, then we know that (40) does not hold for\nany b > a2\/2. Figure 6 shows f(a2\/2d) + f(a2\/(2(1 \u2212 d))) for all d \u2265 1\/2, which is strictly\npositive for all d > 1\/2. Therefore, (40) does not hold for any b \u2265 a2\/2.\nCASE 2: b < a2\/2. In this case we have at d = 1\/2 that 2f(2b) < 0, i.e. we are in\na local maximum. If there exist any other local maxima at d > 1\/2, there has to be some\nd\u2032 \u2208 (1\/2, d) that constitutes a local minimum. Therefore, if for some d conditions (40) and\n(37) hold simultaneously, then there exists 1\/2 < d\u2032 < d such that f(b\/d\u2032) + f(b\/1\u2212 d\u2032) > 0.\nAt d\u2032 it has to hold \u03bb\u20322 = b\/(1\u2212 d\u2032) > a2, otherwise f(\u03bb\u20321) + f(\u03bb\u20322) > 0 would not be possible.\nWe also know that \u03bb\u20321 < b\/2 < a2. Since d\n\u2032 < d, we know that \u03bb1 < \u03bb\u20321 and \u03bb\n\u2032\n2 < \u03bb2. Now\nconsider a d\u2032 at which f(\u03bb\u20321) + f(\u03bb\n\u2032\n2) > 0.

So if we can show that the part in the square brackets is positive for all (\u03bb1, \u03bb2) \u2208\n[0, a2]\u00d7 [a2, a3], then it is not possible to increase d starting from any d\u2032 and achieve a neg-\native value of f(\u03bb1) + f(\u03bb2) (which we would need to arrive at another maximum). Since\nmax[0,a2]f\n\u2032(\u03bb)\u03bb2 \u2264 min[a2,a3]f \u2032(\u03bb)\u03bb2, as can be seen in figure 7, it is not possible to have\nanother local maximum in the interior apart from d = 1\/2. QED\n44\nIntermediate value theorem for equilibrium profits \u03a0(b):\nWe want to show that for any K \u2208 (0, 1) there exists some ratio b and an associated\nequilibrium with profits equal to K. Fix some b\u00af. Similar to the existence proof we can find\nfor any fraction of low wage firms d1 and associated unique sequence d2(d1), ... of higher wage\nfirms that fulfill the equilibrium conditions except that the firms do not add to unity. Profits\nin this case are pi(d1) = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb1e\u2212\u03bb1)\n\u220fN\ni=2\n(\n1\u2212e\u2212\u03bbi\n\u03bbi\n)\nwhere \u03bbi = b\u00af\/di. It is easy to\nshow that pi(d1) \u2192d1\u21920 0 and pi(d1) \u2192d1\u2192\u221e 1, and the intermediate value theorem applies.\nTherefore there exists d1 such that pi(d1) = K. This constitutes an equilibrium in an economy\nwith b\u00af workers and S(d1) =\n\u2211N\ni=1 di(d1) firms. Due to constant returns to scale in our model\nthis is also an equilibrium with b = b\u00af\/S(d1) workers and a measure 1 of firms.\nReferences\n[1] Abowd, John M., Francis Kramarz, and David N.
