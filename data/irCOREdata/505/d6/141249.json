INTRODUCTION \nINCE the last decade the research associated with the \ndevelopment of new sensor assays to detect multiple \nanalytes has been growing intensively [1-3]. The use of such \nan intelligent device with the capability of accurate and \nreliable diagnosis could help to decrease probability of harm, \nminimize clinical intervention, costs of medical treatment and \nas a consequence improve long-term public health. This \nrequires new developments and implementation of suitable \nindicators to estimate potential risk factors and their effects on \nhealth, identification of early symptoms of diseases or \nmonitoring the progress of treatment [4, 5]. \nCurrent trends in the development of sensing technologies \nmimic perception of mammalian smell and taste (schematically \nshown in Fig. 1a). Known as electronic noses (e-noses) and \ntongues (e-tongues), these techniques [6, 7] are based on the \n'smelling\/tasting' array of cross-sensitive chemical receptors \nand interpretation of detected composite signals with suitable \nstatistical methods [8, 9] (see Fig. 1b). The specificity of such \na methodology is related to the pattern recognition in response \nto signals produced by interactions of the sample with all \n \nManuscript received October 4, 2010. \n*E.

The obtained patterns are unique to \nparticular conditions and therefore can be considered similar \nas the fingerprints. \nThe analytical capability of such an approach is less likely \nto lie in the measurements of analytes\u2019 concentrations than in \nprofiling the chemical or biological processes and qualitative \nsample analysis. Although both e-nose and e-tongue \ntechnologies are currently commercially available, they suffer \nfrom significant limitations, such as poor stability, limited \nselectivity, low reproducibility, demand for frequent \ncalibration, complexity of generated information, and high \nfabrication costs of sensor arrays [6,12]. \nLately there has been a surge of attention to optical \ndiagnostics, especially in the field of real-time non-invasive in \nvivo detection [13]. This is explained by the facts that optical \ntechniques are often non-destructive, do not require physical \ncontact with a sample during analysis and enable rapid \nresponse [14,15]. They are able to provide information at the \nmolecular level through tissues and living organs originating \nfrom both animals and humans. Light can also be used as a \ntool for manipulating or modifying living cells and can be \nfocused at a tiny spot, which allows precise localised and \nminimal invasive treatment [16]. By providing more effective, \ncheaper and easy accessible service, biophotonics and optical \ndiagnostic technology can have a huge and crucial impact on \nclinical practice. \nRecently we described a fluorescence-based assay with the \noperating principle similar to e-noses and e-tongues used for \nsimultaneous measurements of several physicochemical \nparameters [17]. Those preliminary experiments have been \nperformed to investigate the analytical capability of the \nproposed assay and validate its potential for quantitative \nanalysis of samples. Additionally, previous publication \nincludes the details on the methodology and data evaluation. A \nschematic illustration of the concept of optical\/fluorescent \nassay is shown in Fig. 1c. The mixture of five fluorescent dyes \ninteracts with the sample and generates excitation-emission \nmatrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2) distinctive for \nbiochemical or medical conditions. \nEEMs are generated by passing white light (typically from a \nXe source) through an excitation polychromator which splits \nthe light into different wavelengths at a pre-determined range \nwhich then irradiate the sample in the cuvette. The \nfluorescence light emitted by the sample passes through an \nemission polychromator which also splits the light into\nOptical Assay for Biotechnology and Clinical \nDiagnosis \nEwa Moczko*, Michael Cauchi, Claire Turner, Igor Meglinski, and Sergey Piletsky \nS \n 2 \n \n \nFig. 1.

Using \nchemometric approaches these patterns are further analyzed \nand the optical signal is transferred into analytical \ncharacteristics of the samples. Additionally, for the minimum \ninterference with biological samples, selected fluorescent dyes \nare responsive in the VIS-NIR range. \n \nFig. 2. 3D color mapped surface of the excitation-emission spectral pattern \nfor selected 5 fluorescent dyes: Dye 1 is 8-hydroxypyrene-1\u2019,3,6-trisulfonic \nacid, Dye 2 is Oregon green 514, Dye 3 is Rhodamine B, Dye 4 is Tris(4,7-\ndiphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium dichloride, Dye 5 is Thionin acetate \n[17]. \nIn the current study we investigate the potential of the \ntechnique developed in [17] for qualitative examination of \nbiological and clinical samples. \n The feasibility of this approach has been tested for \nmonitoring development phases of growing bacterial cultures \nand for analysis of urine samples from healthy volunteers and \npatients diagnosed with gastrointestinal diseases. \nIn the first issue we take into account that certain types of \nbacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites have significant impact on \nhuman life considering their beneficial or harmful effects. \nTherefore, controlling the growth of microorganisms is \nnecessary for many practical reasons including medicine, \nprevention or treatments of diseases, production of drugs, etc. \nThis involves the identification of the phases of microbial \ngrowth to inhibit the process or recognize and learn favorable \nenvironmental conditions, which they need to live and \nreproduce. \nThe second test was performed on human urine samples for \nrecognition of three gastro-intestinal diseases (irritable bowel \nsyndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis). They are \ncurrently serious public health problems, which have been \nforecasted to further increase in most countries around the \nworld [18, 19]. The identification of the symptoms, early \ndiagnosis and treatment of these diseases is still challenging \nbecause the etiology and factors causing these complex \n 3 \ndisorders are yet not well known. Therefore, their mechanisms \nare difficult to explain, various types difficult to discriminate \nand therapeutic targets hard to identify [20, 21]. Typically, \ntheir diagnosis involves many analytical tests which are often \ncostly and invasive. Therefore, it is of the great importance to \nsearch for the suitable and sensitive method for controlling \ngastrointestinal microbiota and early detection of dangerous \npathogens [22]. \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nThe assay composed of five commercially available and \ninexpensive fluorescent dyes has been successfully developed \nfor measurements of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and \nionic strength of a solution (given by a buffer concentration) \n[17]. The results obtained have demonstrated, with high \naccuracy, quick, simultaneous identification and calculation of \nseveral physicochemical parameters (see Table I). Analytical \nperformance of the assay was demonstrated with relatively low \nroot means square error (RMSE), which describes the quality \nof fitting of a regression model. \n \nTABLE I \n PERFORMANCE OF FLUORESCENT DYES ASSAY \n Parameter Dye Name Sensitivity \nRange \nRMSE \n1 pH 8-Hydroxypyrene-\n1\u2019,3,6-trisulfonic acid, \nOregon Green 514 \n5 - 9 0.004 \n2 temperature \n[oC] \nRhodamine B 25 - 40  0.437 \n3 dissolved oxygen \n[ppm] \nTris (4,7-diphenyl -\n1,10-phenanthroline) \nruthenium dichloride \n0 - 21.6 0.049 \n4 buffer concentration \n[mM] \n8-Hydroxypyrene- \n1\u2019,3,6 - trisulfonic acid \n5 - 150 6.818 \n \nA. Composition of dyes mixture \nThe mixture of fluorescent dyes were prepared as a stock \nsolution of following dyes: 0.15 mM 8-Hydroxypyrene-1\u2019,3,6-\ntrisulfonic acid, 0.1 mM Rhodamine B, 2 mM Thionin acetate, \n0.025 mM Oregon Green 514, 6 mM Tris (4,7 \u2013 diphenyl - \n1,10 - phenanthroline) ruthenium dichloride. Solutions of dyes \nwere prepared in deionized water and stored in ~5 \u00baC, covered \nwith aluminum foil to protect them from light. The 200 \u00b5l of \neach water\/dye stock solutions were mixed together and used \nin further experiments. \nB. Samples preparation \nThe bacterial strain used in the experiment was Escherichia \ncoli (JM 83) provided by Cranfield University (UK). Bacteria \nwere recovered from frozen state by growing them in a Miller \nLB broth (Fluka Biochemica, Cat No.1.10285), solution of \n12.5 g of the medium in 0.5 L of Milli-Q water, overnight at \n37 \u00baC and subcultured. The bacteria colonies were transferred \ninto centrifuge tubes filled with 20 ml of liquid medium and \nincubated for 60 hours at 37 \u00baC [23]. The tubes with bacteria \ncells were collected at different intervals and centrifuged at \n2800 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was filtered through a \n0.22 \u00b5m filters and 3 ml of the filtrate were transferred into 4 \nml quartz cuvettes. The optical\/fluorescent assay was then \napplied to supernatants taken from suspensions of growing \nbacteria. Control fluorescent measurements were performed \nusing samples without growing bacteria.  Additionally, \nbacterial growth was monitored by measuring the absorption \nof the suspensions [24]. \nFurther experiments have been performed with urine \nsamples obtained from healthy volunteers (CTR) and patients \ndiagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) \nand irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). All volunteers were given \ninformation, consent forms to read and sign, and a \nquestionnaire, which provide details on their diet, exercise, \nsleep, medication and general health. The samples, provided \nby Addenbrookes Hospital (UK), have been obtained prior to \nany medical treatment and\/or conservation. They have been \nstored at -80 \u00baC to maintain sample integrity. Before the \nmeasurements each sample was defrosted, centrifuged at 2800 \nrpm for 20 minutes and filtrated through 0.45 \u00b5m glass fiber \nfilters. The mixture of fluorescent dyes was added into this \nsupernatant, and then measured. \nC. Instrumentation \nThe measurements of fluorescence intensity have been \nperformed using three-dimensional spectrofluorimeter Jobin \nYvon \u2013 SPEX FL-3D (Instruments SA, Stanmore, Middlesex, \nUK) at 0.5 s of time exposure. The spectra have been recorded \nover a range of excitation (74-691 nm) and emission (227-724 \nnm) wavelengths. The range of wavelengths was based on the \ntechnical specification of the spectrofluorometer. The \nfluorescence measurements were performed using quartz \ncuvettes with stoppers and a light path of 10 mm. \nAbsorption spectra of bacteria suspensions at different \ngrowing phases were measured with Spectrometer (UVPC \n2100, Shimadzu, Japan) at 550 nm. \nD. Data evaluation \nThe changes in fluorescent patterns (see an example in Fig. \n2) caused by interactions with the dyes surrounding media \nhave been analyzed using an artificial neural network (ANN). \nANNs were implemented in MATLAB (version 7.3.0, \nMathWorks Inc., 2006) using the Neural Network Toolbox \n(version 5.0.1) and trained on the data patterns of samples of \nknown identity (45 samples with known time of bacteria \ngrowth from 0 to 60 hours) using Bayesian back-propagation \nof errors [25]. Once the ANN was trained, the approach was \napplied for evaluation of 18 unseen samples. Based on \nlearning experience, the network was capable of identifying \nunknown fluorescent fingerprints and predicting outputs \n(identifying different test solutions). \nThe total number of urine samples provided was limited to \n32. We admit that this number is small yet for statistical \n 4 \npurposes it is suitable to generate preliminary results leading to \na proof of concept. Table II summarizes the sample \ndistribution between the disease states. In order to classify the \nthree gastrointestinal diseases pertaining to the urine samples \nvia their EEM spectra, two approaches were undertaken. \n  \nTABLE II \nNUMBER OF DISEASE STATES IN URINE SAMPLES \nDisease Control \n(CTRL) \nIrritable \nbowel \nsyndrome \n(IBS) \nCrohn\u2019s \ndisease \n (CD) \nUlcerative \ncolitis (UC) \nNumber of \nsamples \n9 11 6 6 \n \nThe first involved performing principal components analysis \n(PCA) [25] on each sample\u2019s EEM spectrum in order to attain \nthe most influential emission profiles. This was achieved by \ntaking, for each sample, the loadings profile of the first \nprincipal component (PC1) which is generated from the \ndecomposition of the respective EEM spectrum. The PC1 \nloadings profile is taken because it will have a high percentage \nof variance and have no contribution from noise within the \nEEM spectrum. The collection of profiles were inputs for the \nANN probability network [26] to classify each of the three \ndiseases from the healthy controls by assigning class values to \nthe states: 1 for healthy; 2 for disease. Leave-one-out cross-\nvalidation (LOO-CV) permitted each sample to be classified \nleading to an overall success of classification. In order to \nperform a thorough analysis, and thus to ascertain the best \nresults, different scaling techniques were employed such as \nmean-centering, auto-scaling and range-scaling. Each have \ntheir own merits: mean-centering removes any offset from the \ndata originating for example from instrumental drift; auto-\nscaling permits the analysis of the data by correlation and not \ncovariance; range-scaling make all the samples equally \nimportant therefore biological activity dominates.  The linear \nclassification technique of partial least squares discriminant \nanalysis (PLSDA) [27] was also employed for comparison \nagainst ANN. The technique of PLSDA attempts to maximize \nthe covariance between the classification (healthy vs disease) \nand the loadings profiles. \nThe second approach involved the use of a multi-way \ntechnique called parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis [28]. It \nis a multi-way extension of PCA and thus permits data \nreduction of a data cube (collection of EEMs) into a scores \nmatrix and two loadings matrices: the first containing profiles \npertaining to excitation wavelengths; the second containing \nprofiles pertaining to emission wavelengths. The key \nadvantage with this technique is that given the correct number \nof components have been selected, the pure fluorescence \nemission spectra for each dye can be captured within the \nPARAFAC loadings [29]. The loadings corresponding to the \nemission spectra were combined with the scores to reproduce \nthe sample matrix in which the number of rows corresponds to \nthe number of samples and the number of columns to the \nemission wavelength range. This matrix formed the input \nparameters for PLSDA and the ANN probability network. \nClassification was performed as described above. \nFinally, in order to ensure that the results were valid, a \nMonte Carlo simulation was performed [30]. This involves \ngenerating random class values for each sample and then \nclassifying via the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) \nmethod. The number of runs was set to 500. This is to \nguarantee a normal distribution is attained. If the overall \nclassified result is beyond the 95% confidence limit, then that \nresult can be deemed valid. \nIII. RESULTS \nIn the analysis of bacteria growth the mixture of dyes was \nadded to supernatants taken from suspensions of growing \nmicrorganisms. Samples were collected at different intervals of \ntime. During their growth the concentration of nutrients, \noxygen and pH were changing. These reflected in the \nmodification of dyes spectra which were further analyzed by \nANN. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the \nabsorption of the suspensions. Additionally, control \nmeasurements were performed using samples consisting of the \nmixture of fluorescence dyes in solutions of only the medium \n(LB broth), without growing cells. They were kept in the same \ncondition as diagnosed samples. The results for control \nmeasurements showed no changes in fluorescence signal, \nwhereas the changes in fluorescence caused by the presence of \nbacteria have been clearly identified. \nThe results of ANN predictions are presented in Fig. 3. The \ngraph illustrates the correlation between real (measured) time \nof growth of bacteria culture (x axis), and the time predicted \nby ANN (y axis). Circles (\u25cb) indicate the mean values of data \npoints of the network prediction and error bars indicate \nstandard deviation.  \n0   10 20 30 40 50 60\n0   \n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nPr\ned\nic\nte\nd \ntim\ne\n \n[ h\n \n]\nMeasured time [h]\n \n \n \ny = 1*x + 0.82\n \nFig. 3. Correlation between the time of bacterial growth measured \nexperimentally and predicted by ANN: circles (\u25cb) indicate mean values of \ndata points of ANN simulations: solid line ( \uf8e7 ) shows the best linear fit and \nthe line ( \u2013 \u2022 \u2013 ) presents ideal response of ANN with zero error. Error bars \nindicate standard deviation. \n \nThese results demonstrate capability of the technique to \nidentify detected fluorescent fingerprints and predict outputs. \n 5 \nThe RMSE is 6.412 and indicates very accurate prediction and \nthe potential of the dye assay application to analyze biological \nsamples. \nClassification of the urine samples (Fig. 4) shows great \npromise particularly when performed with artificial neural \nnetworks (ANNs) and in both cases, outperform the linear \napproach of partial least squares discriminant analysis \n(PLSDA). Fig. 4 also shows that, overall, the ANN probability \nnetwork has performed better than PLSDA. However, with \nregards to PCA, the sensitivity of PLSDA is slightly superior \nto that of ANN (Fig. 4a and 4b) which means that it can \ndistinguish the respective disease better with the exception of \nulcerative colitis (UC). \n \n \n \nFig. 4. Comparison of the PLSDA (a and c) against the ANN probability \nnetwork (b and d) to discriminate the three diseases from the healthy controls \nin terms of % Overall*, % Specificity** and % Sensitivity*** after \napplication of PCA (a and b) and PARAFAC (c and d) to each EEM. \n*Overall means the overall success of discrimination; **Specificity \nrepresents the number of true negatives (e.g. healthy samples). If the \npercentage of true negatives was 90% (90 out of 100 healthy samples were \nclassified correctly) then there would be 10% false positives (10 out of 100 \nhealthy samples incorrectly classified, i.e. classed as diseased); \n***Sensitivity represents the number of true positives (e.g. diseased \nsamples). If the percentage of true positives were 95% (95 out of 100 diseased \nsamples correctly classified), then there would be 5% false negatives (5 out of \n100 diseased samples incorrectly classified, i.e. classed as healthy). \n \nHowever in terms of specificity we observe 100% which \nimplies that the healthy control can be completely \ndistinguished from the diseased samples. With regards to \nPARAFAC (Fig. 4c and 4d) the ANN probability network has \nperformed better than PLSDA but also has resulted in a better \noutcome than the application of PCA. On this occasion, the \nsensitivity pertaining to UC in PLSDA (100%) is better than \nANN (83%) yet the corresponding specificity is much worse \n(Fig. 4c). \nIn order to confirm that the results are indeed valid, Monte \nCarlo simulations were performed. In this context, the word \n\u201csimulation\u201d does not refer to a hypothetical situation \n(emulation of reality) but the fact that repeated sampling is \nperformed. In this case, the classification vector is randomly \ngenerated, and then used in the classification procedure with \neither PLSDA or ANN. \nFig. 5 shows two examples of plots attained which affirm \nthat the results are valid. Both plots (Fig. 5a and 5b) show a \nnormal distribution and that the overall percent classified is \nbeyond the 95% confidence limit, in other words the results \nare significant and not due to chance. The reason for the lack \nof results, e.g. ~42% and ~68% in Fig. 5a and ~53% in Fig. \n5b, is due to the fact there is an odd number of samples in the \ncontrol dataset in conjunction with the respective data sets not \nbalanced. \n \n \nFig. 5. Monte Carlo simulations applied to the urine samples in which very \ngood overall classifications were attained for PCA (a) and PARAFAC (b). \n \nIV. DISCUSSION \nThese promising results indicate that it is possible to use the \nfluorescence signals of a dye assay combined with an artificial \nneural network (ANN) model in the determination of bacterial \npresence and their growth phases. This would be helpful for \nanalysis of the quality of clinical, pharmaceutical or \nbiomedical samples. Further analysis can be improved by \ninvestigation of specific factors which affect bacteria growth, \nsuch as pH, oxygen, salt, sugars or nutrients concentration. \nUsually, these parameters are optimal for one strain but they \ntend to vary for others. They also can change the natural \nenvironment and affect the growth of particular strain of \nmicroorganisms. Therefore it is important to know the actual \neffects of single factors on the growth of microbial. The \ncurrent results indicate that it is possible to control the growth \nrate of microorganisms implying that in the future it will be \ncomprehensively possible to inhibit unwanted strains from \ngrowing such as human pathogenic bacteria. Conversely, it can \nlead to the improvement of the development of the beneficial \nstrains once the impact of certain factors on their growth is \nbetter understood. \nThe work here has also demonstrated that ANNs can be \nemployed as a classification tool to distinguish three \ngastrointestinal diseases (irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s \ndisease, and ulcerative colitis) from healthy controls with \nextremely good overall accuracies of >90%. ANNs also \nperformed better than partial least squares discriminant \nanalysis (PLSDA). This can be partly attributed to the fact that \nPLSDA can only model linear relationships where as ANNs \nare able to model both linear and non-linear relationships [26]. \n 6 \nFurthermore, classification via PLSDA has produced very \ngood sensitivities but poor specificities which imply that many \nfalse positives were predicted (Fig. 4c). In contrast, the \nclassification via ANN has resulted in high sensitivities and \nspecificities, especially for Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) at 92% and \n100% respectively (Fig. 4d). \nHowever the success in distinguishing the diseases from the \ncontrols is also attributable to the data pre-treatment, that is in \nthe employment of parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis to \nextract the pure emission profiles from the EEM spectra \u2013 a \nmajor advantage of PARAFAC provided that the correct \nnumber of components are selected [29]. This was shown to be \nbetter than using principal components analysis (PCA). This is \nbecause PCA only focused on the EEM of one sample \ntherefore a PCA loading (PC1) was generated for each sample. \nHowever, PARAFAC was able to act on all of the EEMs \nsimultaneously, i.e. across all the samples, therefore revealing \nother trends and characteristics within the data that cannot be \ndetected by PCA alone. It must be stated that PCA is not a \nclassification technique; it is exploratory. In this capacity it \nacts as a data reduction technique with the aim of removing \nnoise. PC1 is thus used because it contains the emission profile \nthat will have captured the most variance in the data and have \nzero contributions from noise. \nThe success of the classification of the three diseases against \nthe control is fortified by the application of the Monte Carlo \nsimulation [30]. This has statistically demonstrated that the \nrespective overall accuracies attained are not due to chance \n(Fig. 5). This also implies that the respective models generated \nhave good accuracy. It is therefore feasible to infer that there \nare significant and distinctive characteristics contained within \nthe excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra (e.g. Fig. 2) to \npermit the classification of the diseased samples. \nLeave-one-out cross validation (LOO-CV) is a thorough yet \ntime-consuming procedure, particularly if there are a large \nnumber of samples (e.g. in excess of 100). Other forms of \ncross-validation exist such as venetian blinds cross validation \n(VB-CV) and block cross validation (B-CV) [30]. The former \ninvolves omitting, for example the odd-numbered samples, \nbuilding a model with the even-numbered samples then \nclassifying the odd-numbered samples; the next iteration \nwould involve omitting the even-numbered samples, etc. Other \npermutations could also be implemented. B-CV is more \nsimilar to LOO-CV but instead of omitting one sample, omits \nfor example 10 consecutive samples and builds a model with \nthe remaining samples.  These work faster than LOO-CV yet \nare not as accurate. \nIn recent years the technique of bootstrapping has become \ncommonly employed [30]. A specified number of samples are \nselected randomly from the dataset to form a validation set. \nThe remaining samples thus make up the bootstrap set. The \nlatter is randomly split into a training and test set. A model is \ncreated from the training set then the test set is classified. This \nis repeated N times, e.g. where N could be 250. The model that \nresulted in the best classification is used to classify the \nvalidation set from which the accuracy and performance are \nassessed. Given that accuracy tends to be better, bootstrapping \ncan however be computationally intensive. For this work, the \nlow number of samples present in each subset (as shown in \nTable II) did not permit its use therefore LOO-CV was \nemployed. \nAlthough the total number of samples used in this study are \nlow (32), the study has illustrated the potential of this \nproposed method. The next phase of the work would involve \nsubstantially increasing the number of samples, for example in \nexcess of 100. This would lead to improved clinical relevance \nsince every patient or healthy volunteer will have different \ncharacteristic responses as indicated by the metabolites \ncontained in their urine. Furthermore, the ability to be able to \ndistinguish the diseased samples from each other, for example, \na \u201cone-against-all\u201d approach such as classifying irritable bowel \nsyndrome in the presence of healthy controls, Crohn\u2019s disease \nand ulcerative colitis, should also be investigated. Finally, \nmaking use of the metadata collected via the questionnaire \n(diet, lifestyle, medication, etc) could also be incorporated into \nthe classification model.  \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this study, we demonstrated an optical form of e-nose and \ne-tongue, which offers a promising alternative to \nelectrochemical systems providing highly sensitive, easy and \ninexpensive measurements where no reference signal is \nneeded. The system also gives a possibility of remote sensing \nand further assay miniaturization. Potential of the proposed \nanalytical tool is wide and diverse and can have great impact \non a variety of applications including non-invasive diagnostics \nof tissues, cosmetics testing, early warning of ultraviolet \nradiation abuse, general health monitoring, therapeutic \nmanagement, fundamental physiological investigations and \ndisease diagnosis. \nREFERENCES \n[1] C.

During \n1999-2005, Prof. Piletsky created in Cranfield a Centre \nof Supramolecular Technology (CCST), which combines world class research \n(more than 80 papers in peer-reviewed journals and patent applications \npublished in 1998-2005) with industrial expertise. The main objective of \nCCST is development of world class polymer science aimed at replacement of \nunstable natural receptors with synthetic biomimetic materials. Currently \ncentre consists of 14 members (6 doctors and 8 Ph.D. students). During last \nfour years CCST has been recipient of three EU grants, ROPA Award, \nEPSRC grant, several Faraday studentships, Royal Society\/Wolfson Research \nMerit Award and a number of grants sponsored by industry. \n \n \n \n"}
