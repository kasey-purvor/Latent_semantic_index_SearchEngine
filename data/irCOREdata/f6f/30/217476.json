Based on the assumption that women\u2019s sexual \nsubordination is a key driver of HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, the \nbook provides a compelling account of the structural forces that enable or \n(more often) limit women\u2019s ability to exercise autonomy and agency in their \nrelationships with men. \n \nSusser, a social anthropologist and ethnographer, uses an \u2018extended case \nstudy\u2019 approach, drawing on multiple data sources to illustrate ways in which \ninteracting micro-local, national and global contexts drive the personal and \nsocial devastation that the epidemic wreaks in the lives of poor South \nAfricans. Whilst this work falls squarely within the field of anthropology, it will \nbe of particular interest to health and social psychologists interested in \nunderstanding the wider social contexts that enable or limit health-enhancing \nbehaviours in the context of the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. It will \nalso be of interest to those concerned with the potential role of critical thinking \nand collective action by grassroots \u2018organic intellectuals\u2019 in challenging the \ngender and economic inequalities that fuel the epidemic. \n \nWomen are most vulnerable to HIV infection, comprising 60% of the infected, \nwith those in their early teens five times as likely to be infected as young men \nof the same age. Poor women and rural women are least able to access \neffective care and treatment once infected. Women also carry most of the \nemotionally and economically crippling burden of care for the sick and dying in \nAIDS-affected communities. In unravelling the strands of the mutually \nreinforcing economic, historical, political and cultural factors which feed the \ngender inequalities that limit women\u2019s agency, Susser is at pains to avoid the \n 2 \ncommon tendency to represent African women as passive victims of \ninexorable social forces, seeking to highlight what she calls \u2018spaces of hope\u2019 \u2013 \nillustrating the ingenuity, courage and creativity of particular women who have \nchallenged their extreme oppression in varying degrees of success or failure. \n \nSusser\u2019s interest in depicting women as highly competent social actors and \nagents of social transformation is motivated by her critique of the invisibility of \nAfrican women in current international AIDS discourse. Women are \nrepresented as statistics, members of \u2018risk groups\u2019, \u2018targets\u2019 for \u2018intervention\u2019 \u2013 \nin public health plans that emphasise technical interventions to HIV\/AIDS \u2013\nhealth education, condom distribution, circumcision, VCT. Susser\u2019s material  \nprovides a convincing explanation of why such technical interventions have \nhad so little success in turning around the epidemic. They fail to take account \nof the social, sexual and gender relations that shape the types of choices \nwomen are able to make about their sexuality. They also limit the extent to \nwhich they are able to make optimal use of technically driven AIDS \nprevention, care and treatment services, where these exist. \n \nSusser\u2019s book draws attention to many neglected dimensions of the social \ncontext of the epidemic in South Africa. Thus, for example, she argues that in \npre-colonial times, women had a degree of flexibility and autonomy in their \nrelations with men. This was undermined by colonial authorities, who \nprivileged men through their interpretation and codification of customary law in \nways that excluded women from decision-making councils and from the \ninheritance of land. She provides a fascinating account of the gradual erosion \nof progressive and forward-looking national AIDS policies formulated in the \nearly post-apartheid era in the early 1990\u2019s. She examines this erosion in the \nlight of the country\u2019s growing commitment to neo-liberal economic policies, as \nwell as the use of so-called \u2018traditional (patriarchal) African values\u2019 by both \nPresident Mbeki and the incoming President Zuma as political weapons to \nadvance their power bases in various ways. \n \nShe traces the way in which the economic policies, such as the country\u2019s \n1996 Growth, Employment and Redistribution policy (GEAR), focused on \n 3 \ndeveloping the formal economy in ways that excluded women, children, the \nelderly and the disabled. She highlights the negative social impacts of the \nfocus on market competition over collective and public endeavours, with its \nparallel lack of investment in building the capacities of women, the young and \nthe poor to improve their lives. This, together with the lack of investment in \nsmaller manufacturing and social services (arenas in which women find work \nand seek assistance), has dramatically increased women\u2019s economic \ndependence on men. Survival sex by women has effectively been \nunderwritten by economic policy \u2013 with women being forced to use sexual \nleverage to extract economic resources from men, and men using their wage \nearning power to command the sexual and domestic services of women.  \n \nWhilst women have always had limited access to paid work, there has been \ngrowing unemployment amongst men. This situation has increased the rage \nof many men no longer able to fulfil the role of masculine breadwinner. This \nhas led to an increase in private violence against women, as well as pushing \nwomen into seeking multiple partners when a single partner might not be able \nto give them the degree of economic support they need. \n \nEconomic policy has not only decreased women\u2019s ability to protect their \nsexual health. It has also hampered them in nursing those sick and dying of \nAIDS, in contexts where under-resourced and swamped medical services are \nunable to offer much assistance. Thus for example the government has \ninvested heavily in large scale highways and bridges, without parallel \ninvestment in affordable public transport. In a context where transport \nconstitutes 40% of the costs of caring for someone with AIDS, this situation \nhas exacerbated the suffering of people with AIDS and their (mostly female) \ncarers, particularly in rural areas. The growing move towards privatising clean \nwater is also a particularly severe blow for many rural carers. \n \nIn a vitally important chapter, Susser charts the way in which women\u2019s ability \nto protect their health has been systematically and purposefully limited \nthrough the regulating of AIDS funding, particularly from the US. In 2008, \nPEPFAR (the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) contributed \n 4 \nthe largest proportion of money globally for treatment and prevention of the \nepidemic. PEPFAR policies have been strongly infused with the moralistic \nattitudes of the religious right in the US, with its emphasis on sin, morality and \ngender subordination. Thus, for example, PEPFAR refused to fund any \nprogramme that did not advocate sexual abstinence outside of marriage \u2013 \ndespite the fact that in many African settings, HIV rates are often highest \namongst monogamous married women. It also refused to fund any \nprogramme that offered any kind of prevention or support to commercial sex \nworkers, again in the face of large amounts of research highlighting the way in \nwhich transactional sex was the only route to survival for many women. \n \nSusser concludes that preventing the further spread of AIDS will require \nenergetic investment in human resources, including education, housing, work \nfor women and men, as well as reductions in income inequalities between \nmen and women. She also argues convincingly for the need for a broad \ncoalition between AIDS activists and agencies in South Africa and globally, \nand to link struggles to attain treatment access for all, as well as women\u2019s \nempowerment to the urgent need for increased government investment in \nbasic needs of women, the poor. \n \nIn the face of all her evidence for the way in which the epidemic is driven by \nwidespread \u2018structural violence\u2019 against women, Susser provides an upbeat \nand optimistic account of the role that global and national AIDS movements \nhave played in challenging unjust practices by pharmaceutical companies, \nforcing them to permit lower drug pricing for poor countries. She cites this as \nevidence of companies being forced to take account the needs of the poor in \nunpredented. The positive achievements of the South African Treatment \nAction Campaign \u2013 drawing the bulk of its membership from younger \ngrassroots women \u2013 features heavily in her account of this process.  \nFurthermore, she draws on various ethnographic studies to provide examples \nof women asserting their rights to sexual health in small-scale settings. Using \nGramsci\u2019s theory of social change, she argues that these women qualify as \n\u2018organic intellectuals\u2019 capable of developing analyses of the social relations \nthat disempower them, which constitute a necessary precondition for \n 5 \ncollective action for social change. In the light of this material, her concluding \nchapter argues that the findings of her book are ultimately hopeful for women. \n \nThis claim elicits the first of two critical comments. The first queries the extent \nto which the material in this book can indeed be said to justify Susser\u2019s \noptimism. She certainly illustrates numerous instances of African women \nspeaking assertively about their sexual rights in women-only action research \nsettings, as well as documenting examples of e.g. women in Namibia \nsuccessfully demanding access to female condoms. However, her illustrations \nof such isolated examples of women\u2019s agency and courage in very specific \nsituations pale into insignificance in the face of her compelling evidence for \nthe inexorable structural forces that stand in the way of women\u2019s \nadvancement. \n \nThe book suffers from an uneasy tension between Susser\u2019s clearly stated \ndetermination to view women as competent and effective social actors on the \none hand, and the evidence that she provides for the global, local and \nhistorical forces stacked against them on the other. Few could disagree that \nthe creativity and courage of African women lies at the heart of the survival of \nmany marginalised communities challenged by structural violence and global \ninequalities. However, in relation to the HIV\/AIDS struggle, and women\u2019s \nability to protect their sexual health, Susser\u2019s optimism and hopefulness about \nwomen sit uneasily with the fact that millions of African women continue to be \ninfected in large numbers. They also sit uneasily with the power of her \nevidence for the relentless way in which neo-liberal economic policies, \ntogether with western symbolic and material exploitation of Africa, reinforce \nthe local cultural and historical forces that undermine women\u2019s possibilities for \nsexual health at every turn. \n \nThe second critical comment relates to Susser\u2019s \u2018scatter-gun\u2019 style of drawing \ninter-changeably on a loose and highly selective array of sources in \nconstructing her wide-ranging argument. These include the her own personal \nexperiences \u2013 as American daughter of exiled South African political activists, \nherself an academic and activist; a searing first-hand account of the personal \n 6 \nexperiences of Sbongile Mkhize, a research associate whose family has been \ndevastated by the AIDS deaths of her siblings; a selective review of various \nrelevant historical and anthropological writers on topics ranging from colonial \nhistory to masculinity, culture, social development and kinship; as well as \nvarious original ethnographic studies in various southern African contexts.  \n \nWhilst Susser\u2019s opening preface emphasises that her personal history and \nexperience have shaped her selection of material, this is not followed up in \nlater chapters. It would have been useful to have a more explicit discussion of \nways in which her personal positioning led her to choose and emphasise \nparticular sources of information and not others.  \n \nFurthermore, some readers might have hoped for a more systematic \ndiscussion of the book\u2019s underlying methodological rationale in combining so \nmany diverse sources of information. Others might have hoped for a more \nexplicit theorisation of the multiple and shifting contexts and spaces that \nshape the gender relations that she speaks of. However such an expectation \nmight be unrealistic for such a wide-ranging book, and one that seeks to \nintegrate so many levels of analysis. The very strength of the book may in fact \nlie in the author\u2019s ambitious aim to map out \u2018the big picture\u2019 of AIDS and \nglobalisation in broad brush strokes. There is no doubt that much work \nremains to be done in substantiating and elaborating on many of the important \nand novel ideas she raises. Nevertheless, the book constitutes a valuable and \ninnovative contribution to our understandings of the impact of the local-global \ninterface on the complex interactions of sex, gender and culture that drive the \nAIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. \n \nCatherine Campbell, Institute of Social Psychology, London School of \nEconomics \n"}
