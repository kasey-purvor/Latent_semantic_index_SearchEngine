However \nthe type of sustained low-level activity found in lectures does not promote effective \nlearning or retention of knowledge; indeed it has been shown that attention wanes \nafter about 15-20 minutes and knowledge recall following didactic teaching is often \nonly about 20%. Thus knowledge retention following conventional teaching often \ndecays at an undesirable rate.  \n \nWhy the idea or change was necessary The use of audience response systems \n(ARSs) has been suggested to improve and facilitate learning in a didactic lecture \nsetting by increasing student participation, giving instant feedback, and improving \nknowledge retention. An ARS is being used on a Phase 1 Medical Programme to \nassess prior knowledge, understanding and information decay in first year medical \nstudents. \n \nWhat was done 93 undergraduate medical students attended physiology lectures \nincorporating the use of the ARS KEEpad. KEEpad was used to ask the students an \nMCQ before the lecture to assess prior knowledge of some aspects of renal \n 2 \nphysiology; at the end of the lecture to assess understanding and thus whether \nlearning had occurred; and 5 weeks later to assess knowledge retention. Ethical \npermission was not required as the data forms part of anonymised, routinely collected \ndata without harms. At the end of the module students were asked to complete an \nevaluation form which included 2 questions on the use of KEEpad. The form included \na 6-point Likert scale with the descriptors on an even scale, and space for free-text \ncomments. The 2 questions regarding use of the ARS were The KEEpad audience \nresponse system gives me feedback on my progress and The KEEpad audience \nresponse system supports the learning experience.  \n \nEvaluation of results and impact Before the lecture was delivered 40% of the class \nselected the correct answer using KEEpad, showing a moderate degree of prior \nknowledge of this topic. This was expected as the students had been introduced to the \nconcept of Starling forces in cardiovascular physiology and were thus demonstrating \nan ability to apply the knowledge to a different body system. At this point the correct \nanswer was not given. The same question was then asked at the end of the lecture and \nthe percentage of students choosing the correct answer increased to 79%. Five weeks \nlater the same question was put to the students, again using KEEpad. The percentage \nof students selecting the correct answer was 60%. This is a 77% recall rate; \nconsiderably higher than the literature suggests following conventional didactic \nlectures. The evaluation forms showed student satisfaction regarding use of KEEpad \nwas 100% and 98% respectively. The use of KEEpad demonstrated that learning \noccurred during the didactic lecture and that recall rate after 5 weeks was high. \nStudents\u2019 satisfaction on the use of KEEpad for feedback and the learning experience \n 3 \nduring lectures was extremely high. The audience response system is a useful and low \ncost tool to improve knowledge retention in undergraduate medical education.  \n"}
