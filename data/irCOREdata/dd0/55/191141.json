What we see there, however, remains somewhat of a para-\ndox. It is becoming apparent that the stars we observe closest to the\ncentre are predominantly hot, blue stars \u2013 even though relatively\nunobscured observations can only be made in the H and K bands\nwhich are strongly biased towards picking up those stars which are\nredder \u2013 and that their appearance suggests that they are young and\nmassive. Genzel et al. (2003) observe two disks of hot stars within\nthe central 1\u201d \u2013 10\u201d (0.04 \u2013 0.4 pc), which appear to contain ab-\nnormally high numbers of Wolf-Rayet (WR) and luminous blue\nvariable (LBV) stars (Paumard et al. 2001), both products of the\nlater stages of massive stellar evolution. There is some evidence\nthat both this region and the Galactic Centre area in general have\ninitial mass functions (IMFs) which are either biased towards the\nhigh-mass end or else have an abnormally high lower mass limit\nwith respect to a standard Salpeter-like IMF (Nayakshin & Sun-\nyaev 2005, Stolte et al. 2005). However, the extreme tidal forces\nin the Galactic centre region make the normal formation of stars in\nsitu a difficult task. Either these apparently massive stars must have\nformed in a non-standard manner or else they must have migrated\n\u22c6 E-mail: Lynnette.Dray@astro.le.ac.uk\ninwards in a timescale short enough to accommodate the lifespan\nof an O star (Hansen & Milosavljec 2003), a few 107 years at most.\nThe Sgr A\u2217 cluster is located even closer to the central black\nhole than the hot star populations described above \u2013 it contains\nthe stars with the smallest known distances of approach to Sgr A\u2217\n(Ghez et al. 2003). Unlike the disk stars, their orbits are isotrop-\nically distributed and highly eccentric (e \u223c 0.3 \u2013 0.9), with peri-\nbothra as low as 0.5 mpc. These stars are also blue. K-band spec-\ntroscopy (Ghez et al. 2003; Eisenhauer et al. 2005) suggests that\nthey are young O and\/or B stars. The formation problems associ-\nated with the massive stellar disks are even worse for the Sgr A\u2217\ncluster. If these stars formed in situ, their formation was subject to\neven stronger tidal forces. Similarly, any inward migration is likely\nto have been even more strongly impeded. It has been suggested\nthat they are the remains of a shredded open cluster drawn inwards\nby dynamical friction (Kim & Morris 2003), perhaps containing an\nintermediate mass black hole to keep it tightly bound enough to get\nin close enough to deliver them to their current location (McMillan\n& Portegies Zwart 2003). However, these solutions would lead to\nspatial distributions of stars different from those observed (Ghez\net al. 2005). Perhaps the most promising solution is that the high-\nvelocity stars (HVSs) observed to be heading away from the Galac-\ntic Centre with velocities of hundreds of kms\u22121 (e.g. Brown et al\n2005) share a common origin with the Sgr A\u2217 cluster, via the split-\nting of binary systems which encounter the black hole. In this sce-\n2 L. M. Dray, A. R. King and M. B. Davies\nnario, one component of the binary is ejected to become a HVS\nand the other is captured (Gould & Quillen 2003; Perets, Hopman\n& Alexander 2006).\nOne possible solution to the problem is that the Sgr A\u2217 cluster\nstars are not young stars at all \u2013 that they merely look like them.\nAs proposed by Davies & King (2005), another way to make blue\nstars in the Galactic centre region is to strip away the outer layers\nof giants, exposing their hot cores. On many of the orbits on which\nthe Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars currently reside, a RGB or AGB star would\noverfill its Roche lobe by several times at the point of closest ap-\nproach to the black hole. Given that another of the well-known mys-\nteries regarding the central region is the lack of red giants therein\n(Genzel et al. 1996; but see also Jimenez et al. 2006), this suggests\nthat any giant star which ends up in the region after scattering onto\nan orbit passing close to Sgr A\u2217 quickly loses some or all of its en-\nvelope through tidal interactions with the black hole. The exposed\ncore of such a star will appear blue, and it is possible under the\nrestricted observing conditions imposed by the Galactic centre en-\nvironment that it may resemble an O or B star for the portion of its\nstripped lifetime that it is visible.\nThis formation route for the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars also accounts\nfor their observed tightly-bound, eccentric orbits. Although the\nscattered star initially approaches the black hole on a near-parabolic\norbit, the energy required to unbind the envelope is of a similar or-\nder to the orbital energy loss required to produce orbits similar to\nthose observed. This energy requirement also puts constraints on\nwhich progenitor stars can feasibly reproduce the observed Sgr A\u2217\ncluster population. Input stars must be able to survive the strip-\nping process without being completely shredded. Those for which\nthe stripping of the entire envelope does not provide enough en-\nergy loss to produce a closely-bound orbit will end up on nearly-\nparabolic orbits in which they are only observable close to pericen-\ntre \u2013 a negligible fraction of their lifetimes. Input stars must also\nhave large radii to end up on orbits similar to those observed. The\ninitial distance of closest approach to the black hole corresponds to\nthe periastron distance in the post-stripping orbit. At periastron dis-\ntances similar to those observed, a main-sequence star is not large\nenough to fill its instantaneous tidal lobe. Such stars have to pass\nfar closer to the central black hole to undergo tidal mass loss. This,\ncombined with their less centrally-condensed structures, suggests\nthat main-sequence stars are probably shredded completely once\nthey have filled their tidal lobes. Envelope stripping in the central\nregion, albeit by stellar collisions, has also been invoked by Alexan-\nder (1999) to explain the distribution of stars in the inner 0.05 pc.\nThere are further observational constraints that these stripped\ngiants must obey if they are to be a plausible explanation for the\nSgr A\u2217 cluster. The cluster stars all appear to be on or near the\nmain sequence; therefore we require that the observable population\nof stripped stars must also primarily reside in this area of the HR\ndiagram. Since K-band visibility increases rapidly with decreasing\nTeff, this is (if one ignores the potential effect of low-luminosity\nAGN irradiation on their atmospheres; Jimenez et al. 2006) a strong\nconstraint on how red the stars may be. However, a population bluer\nthan the main sequence is simply invisible in the K-band to current\nobservational limits and is therefore only constrained by the re-\nquirement that the scattering event rate (Wang & Merritt 2004) and\nthe mass of unobservable remnants (Goodman & Paczynski 2005)\nbe realistic. The stripped stars must also display a similar spec-\ntrum in the K-band to those observed. This requires, for instance,\na composition including a non-negligible surface hydrogen abun-\ndance, and an absence of Wolf-Rayet-like emission lines. Lastly,\nthey must also be capable of reasonably rapid rotation; for exam-\nple, the star S2 (S0-2) has a vsin i value of around 220kms\u22121 . Of\nthese, the event rate is the most pressing problem. In this paper we\nconsider whether those constraints can be met by running simula-\ntions of rapidly-stripped stars from different input populations and\ncomparing them with the observations.\n2 SIMULATIONS\nThe process of tidal stripping is a complex one, and it is far from\ncertain that the apparent balance between envelope binding energy\nand orbital energy translates into the possibility of a real and ef-\nficient transfer of energy between the two. To study this, we take\na two-pronged approach. Firstly, the tidal mass loss itself and its\neffect on the orbit is being studied by means of detailed SPH sim-\nulations (Dale et al., in preparation). Secondly, the evolution of\nstripped stars with simple assumptions about the stripping process\nover a range of input parameters is calculated in order that their\nproperties may be compared with those of the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars.\nThis is the subject of the current paper. In doing so we have as-\nsumed the stripping process itself and the uncertainties relating to\nit (whether, for example, there is really an efficient conversion be-\ntween orbital and envelope binding energy, and whether the stellar\ncore is able to survive the process) to be a \u2018black box\u2019 to be ex-\nplained or disproved by the SPH simulations.\n2.1 Code\nWe use the Eggleton stellar evolution code (Eggleton 1971, Pols\net al. 1998), including the convective overshooting prescription of\nPols et al. (1998) with \u03b4ov = 0.12, which is roughly equivalent to\nan overshooting distance of 0.2Hp, where Hp is the pressure scale\nheight. This leads in general to relatively large model cores. All of\nthe runs in this paper were carried out at a metallicity of Z = 0.02\nas appropriate for the Galactic Centre region (Najarro et al. 2004;\nCarr, Sellgren & Balachandran 2000). A slightly higher or lower\nmetallicity is unlikely to make a strong difference. Wind mass loss\nis included according to the prescription of de Jager et al. (1988),\nbut is generally small for most of the masses we have considered.\nWhilst we can run the code following binary evolution including\nmass loss to a companion (in this case the black hole), we here\ntreat our star as a single star, and a constant high rate of mass loss\nto it at the appropriate age to simulate the stripping event.\nThe rapid nature of the mass loss from the stars we are con-\nsidering presents a problem for simulation. Essentially, the entire\nenvelope may be removed in a single orbit of the black hole; this\nequates to a mass-loss rate which may be over a solar mass a year,\nwhich is difficult to apply in any realistic way to a stellar evolution\ncode. What we can do, however, is apply mass loss at the fastest\nrate which the code will sustain. This is an approximate approach,\nas equilibrium is assumed throughout, but gives a general idea of\nhow these stars will behave. The mass-loss rate used varies slightly\nfrom star to star \u2013 since we use in each case the largest rate the\ncode will support without breaking down \u2013 but is generally between\n10\u22121 and 10\u22123M\u2299 yr\u22121. In all cases the entire mass loss event lasts\nsignificantly less long than would be a typical timestep for normal\nevolution of that star at that evolutionary stage. From the evolution\nof other stars which are or have been affected by rapid mass loss\n\u2013 the primaries in interacting binary systems, subdwarf O and B\nstars and massive Wolf-Rayet stars \u2013 it is possible to infer that the\nmost likely course for our stripped stars is a rapid journey to the\nblue part of the HR diagram followed by a relatively stable period\nYoung stars in the Galactic Centre 3\nFigure 1.

However, the range of plausible pre-stripping\nmasses for at least the visible cluster stars is limited at the lower\nend by stars which are unlikely to become luminous enough to be\nobservable in the Galactic centre region, and at the upper end by\nstars which are likely to have a Wolf Rayet-like appearance when\nstripped and are thus relatively easily distinguishable from B stars.\nWe limit our detailed simulation input mass range to between 1 and\n50M\u2299. In this range we run model grids at 21 log-spaced masses,\nand interpolate as required between the resulting tracks. However,\nwe consider stars over the whole range of potential IMFs by us-\ning the synthetic stellar evolution formulae of Tout et al. (1997) for\nlower masses. For these stars it is highly unlikely that we can create\na blue core which is as luminous as those observed \u2013 a rapid tran-\nsition to white dwarf status is the most likely outcome of stripping.\nFurthermore, most stars below 1M\u2299 have sufficiently long evolu-\ntionary timescales that at the current age of the Universe they will\nstill be on the main sequence, and are therefore ruled out as progen-\nitors for at least the currently-observed Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars. Whilst\nit is possible that the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars are stripped stars in the\nupper region of or even above the mass range we simulate, the short\nlifetimes of very massive stars (a few Myr) are a strong impediment\nto getting them in to the Galactic centre region in time. It is still pos-\nsible, however, that they could have been scattered from the disks\nof stars at \u223c 0.4pc, which are massive and may have been formed\nin situ (Nayakshin & Sunyaev 2005). Normally intermediate-mass\nstars are strongly favoured by the IMF over more massive stars,\nbut there is evidence that in the Galactic Centre region the IMF is\nsignificantly top-heavy or may have a high lower limit (Stolte et\nal. 2005). However in this case the original (albeit not the current)\nmasses of the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars would be greater than that usu-\nally inferred in the case that they are B stars! In this scenario the\n\u2018Paradox of Youth\u2019 (Ghez et al. 2003) is not resolved; at the least it\nis a requirement that the massive star disks formed in their current\nlocation. Such an origin may also require that the relaxation time in\nthe central parsec is shorter than the life of a\u223c 6M\u2299 star, i.e.\u223c 108\nyears.\nThe simulations are ended either when the star has become\na white dwarf, when degenerate carbon burning ignites or when\ncentral carbon burning ends for the more massive models.\n2.2.2 Evolutionary Stage at Stripping\nSince tidal stripping can occur rapidly when a giant is scattered\nonto a orbit which passes close to the central black hole, the evo-\nlutionary point at which the stripping occurs does not necessarily\ncorrespond to the stages in the star\u2019s life when it is beginning to\nexpand, as it would for Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) in a binary\nsystem. Instead, this violent RLOF-like event may occur at any\npoint in the star\u2019s life when its radius is above the instantaneous\ntidal radius on the scattered orbit,\nRtidal \u2243 0.462\n(\nM\u2217\nMBH\n)1\/3\np , (1)\nwhere p is the periastron and M\u2217 and MBH are the masses of\nthe scattered star and the black hole respectively. However, anal-\nogously to RLOF, there is also the possibility that stars which are\nscattered onto near-parabolic orbits when their radii are too small\nfor the stripping process to take place (as is likely for main se-\nquence stars, which should form the bulk of the scattered popula-\ntion) may be stripped on a subsequent orbit of the black hole when\nthey have evolved into larger-radius objects. This requires that the\norbital time be less than the evolutionary timescale of the star \u2013 in\nthe case of our best-matching models a period of a few 106 years is\nprobably the maximum for these orbits, corresponding to an initial\ntidal interaction on first pass close to the black hole which extracts\nsome 1046 ergs of energy from the orbit. Depending on the relax-\nation time in the region near Sgr A\u2217 and the resulting period, some\nof these stars are also likely to be scattered back off these long or-\nbits before they can be stripped.\nTo allow for a distribution of scattering times, we simulate for\neach of our stellar models the onset of rapid mass loss at the RGB\nbase, middle and tip, on the horizontal branch and at the base and\nmiddle of the AGB. Stars which approach close enough to tidally\n4 L. M. Dray, A. R. King and M. B. Davies\noverflow whilst they are still on the main sequence are likely to be\ncompletely disrupted.\n2.2.3 Amount of Envelope Remaining\nWithout detailed calculations of the effect the tidal forces have on\nthe star (currently in progress) it is hard to say exactly how much\nof the envelope will be stripped. For the vast majority of possible\norbits the answer will be \u2018nearly all\u2019 but the remaining amount can\nstrongly affect how blue the star becomes, if it becomes blue at all,\nand also its remaining lifetime after the stripping event. In order to\nget an idea of how much of the envelope needs to be removed be-\nfore a blue star is obtained, we run models at each of the above grid\npoints which are left with 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 percent of their en-\nvelopes. The latter few situations are unlikely \u2013 requiring scattering\nonto a grazing orbit and therefore relatively mild mass loss. Typi-\ncal evolutionary tracks are shown in Fig. 1. Generally stars with\nmore than about 5 percent remaining envelope spend a significant\namount of their subsequent evolution as red giants.\nThe amount of envelope left strongly affects the orbit the\nstripped star ends up on, as it limits the amount of energy which\ncan be extracted by envelope removal. It is possible that different\nSgr A\u2217 cluster stars have different amounts of remaining envelope.\nIt is also notable that since the smaller the mass of the stripped core,\nthe smaller its orbital energy (in an equivalent orbit), the criterion\nthat the binding energy of the removed envelope be comparable\nto the orbital energy a typical Sgr A\u2217 cluster star would have if it\nwere at the remaining core mass is fulfilled by a wide range of ini-\ntial masses, provided the star is large enough to overflow its tidal\nlobe in that orbit. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 for stellar models at\nvarious masses.\n3 INPUT POPULATION\nSimulations which calculate the disruption rate of stars by black\nholes frequently restrict the stellar input distribution to a single\nmass and radius (e.g. Wang & Merritt 2004). However, that ap-\nproach is clearly of little use here, since we wish to simulate a pop-\nulation which is likely to arise from a relatively small segment (the\nhigh-mass, large-radius end) of a diverse input population. Input\nmasses will initially be distributed according to an IMF which, at\nleast for stars originating from outside the immediate Galactic Cen-\ntre region, is likely to be Salpeter-like (e.g. Kroupa 2001). However,\nthe probability of a star ending up on an orbit which passes close to\nSgr A\u2217 also depends on its mass and radius, as does its final orbit.\nIf the star is not stripped on its first pass of the black hole, whether\nit can be stripped on a subsequent pass depends on its future radius\nevolution.\n3.1 Scattering and event rate\nThe tidal disruption loss cone of a galaxy is the set of orbits for\nwhich stars pass sufficiently close to the central black hole for tidal\ndisruption to take place. This can only happen once per star so, as\nwell as having to be populated in the first place, the loss cone must\nbe continually refilled if the number of tidal disruptions is not to\ndrop to zero with time (e.g. Merritt & Wang 2005). The total scat-\ntering rate for loss cone stars and the loss cone refilling rate have\nbeen estimated by various authors (e.g. Frank & Rees 1976; Light-\nman & Shapiro 1977; Rees 1988; Magorrian & Tremaine 1999;\nMerritt & Poon 2004; Wang & Merritt 2004; Ivanov, Polnarev &\nSaha 2005; Holley-Bockelmann & Sigurdsson 2006) and may vary\nover several orders of magnitude depending on the assumptions\nused. We use the scattering rate of Wang & Merritt (2004),\n\u02d9N \u2248 6.5\u00d710\u22124 yr\u22121\n(\nMBH\n106M\u2299\n)\n\u22120.25\n, (2)\nwhich utilises the M-\u03c3 relation of Merritt & Ferrarese (2001), and\nassume that MBH is 3.61\u00d7106M\u2299 (Eisenhauer et al. 2005). Whilst\nthe above rate is derived for solar-type stars only, it scales with mass\nand radius only as m\u22121\/3\u2217 r\n1\/4\n\u2217 . For the models we have run we find\nthat the overall scattering rate integrated over realistic populations\ndiffers from this by less than a factor of 3, provided the slope of the\nupper IMF is Salpeter-like. The amount of difference depends on\nthe IMF, with more top-heavy IMFs having smaller scattering rates.\nIn the case of IMFs with flatter upper slopes, such as that posited\nfor the core of the Arches cluster (Stolte et al. 2005), the difference\nmay be a factor of 10 or more.\nWe assume stars, initially distributed according to either a\nSalpeter or top-heavy IMF, are supplied to the loss cone at a point\nin their life chosen randomly but weighted according to the mass\nand radius distribution above. This results in a number of distinc-\ntive characteristics for those stars which end up on loss cone orbits.\nFirstly, short lifetimes and the mass-dependence of the scattering\nrate ensure that few of the most massive stars (> 15M\u2299) contribute\nto the population, even for top-heavy IMFs. Since such stars, once\nstripped, would probably display WR-like emission lines in their\nspectra unlike the observed Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars, this seems reason-\nable. Secondly, if one assumes a Salpeter IMF, most of the loss cone\nstars are in fact low mass main sequence stars which will be dis-\nrupted completely by a tidal-radius encounter with the black hole.\nEven if one assumes an IMF weighted towards more massive stars,\nas might be typical of the Galactic Centre region, most of the stars\nwhich are stripped will be main-sequence stars on close orbits. The\nSgr A\u2217 cluster stars in this picture therefore arise from a relatively\nsmall proportion (a few percent) of the total number of stars scat-\ntered; those on the giant or horizontal branches.\nA further complication arises in that tidal stripping is not the\nonly possible outcome of stars passing close to the black hole. Stars\nwhich pass the black hole at a distance above a tidal radius may\nstill dissipate energy due to tidal distortion of the envelope, becom-\ning tidally captured but not stripped. Such interactions may occur\nfor initial peribothron distances of about three tidal radii (Novikov,\nPethick & Polnarev 1992). On subsequent peribothra further tidal\ninteractions take place, gradually causing the orbit to decay. If the\nstar were able to survive these repeated interactions (which is un-\nlikely, see Novikov et al. 1992) this would eventually result in a\nvery close, circular orbit around the black hole. Relatedly, some\nmain sequence stars are also scattered onto the red giant loss cone.\nOn their first passage past the black hole these stars do not come\nclose enough for significant tidal interaction at their current radii\nbut they subsequently evolve to large enough radii that stripping\ncan occur on a later orbit (Syer & Ulmer 1999). It is possible that at\nleast some of the loss cone orbits are chaotic and indeed that chaotic\norbits may be required if the loss cone is to be kept full (e.g. Merritt\n& Poon 2004, Holley-Bockelmann & Sigurdsson 2006), in which\ncase this population may be minimal. However, if not, the popula-\ntion of stars late-stripped in this way should be larger than the pop-\nulation from direct stripping on first peribothron passage. Since the\nradius-dependence of the scattering probability is relatively shallow\nthe magnitude of this late-stripped stars effect is less than might at\nfirst be assumed. However, it is important in that nearly all the stars\nsupplied to the black hole in this way are giants which are much\nYoung stars in the Galactic Centre 5\nFigure 2. Energy required to strip 90 % (solid lines) and 99 % (dashed lines) of a star\u2019s envelope over the later phases of its lifetime, for different initial\nmasses. Also shown greyed-out is the area in energy corresponding to the range of orbital energies which Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars with known orbits (Eisenhauer\net al. 2005) would have if they were the mass of the resulting stripped stars. The darker grey area indicates the region of overlap between the energy range for\nthe 90 % and 99 % stripped cores.\nless likely to suffer complete disruption than the main-sequence\nstars. Therefore stars which are stripped on their first pass of the\nblack hole give very much a lower limit to the number of poten-\ntially observable Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars. An estimate of the popula-\ntion from this later stripping comes from running our simulations\nwith the assumption that a star is stripped if scattered onto the loss\ncone corresponding to its maximum rather than current radius, i.e.\nPscatter \u221d m\n\u22121\/3\n\u2217 r\n1\/4\nmax,\u2217. We then assign it a probability-weighted pe-\nriastron distance in the range rtidal,current to rtidal,max.radius and add\nit into the stripped stars population when it is large enough to over-\nflow at periastron. This approach overestimates the population only\nin cases where the evolutionary timescale is shorter than the orbital\ntimescale, which is not the case for most stars. It should be noted\nthat we restrict the maximum-radius calculation to ages of less than\n1010 years, so as to exclude stars which cannot have evolved to their\npresent state in the time available, e.g. 0.5M\u2299 giants. This leads ef-\nfectively to a mildly top-heavy IMF with a turn-over at around 1M\u2299\namongst the stars which end up being stripped when a Salpeter-like\nIMF input population is assumed, since the maximum radii of more\nmassive stars within the time limit are larger.\nGiven the r-dependence for stars passing within their tidal ra-\ndius above and assuming stars typically increase their radii by a fac-\ntor of a few hundred between the main sequence and giant phases,\nit seems likely that the late-stripping giant population is roughly a\nfew times the population of main-sequence stars stripped on their\nfirst pass of the black hole. This is borne out by simulation results;\nthe factor by which the scattered population increases varies from\nless than 0.1 for stars with a \u2018normal\u2019 IMF (Kroupa 2001; the small\nchange is due to the high proportion of low-mass stars) to over 3\nfor stars with the most top-heavy IMF. However the top-heavy IMF\npopulations had the lowest scattering rates to begin with. We call\nmodels incorporating stripping after the first pass \u2019late-stripping\u2019\nmodels. As well as significantly increasing the visible Sgr A\u2217 clus-\nter population and the number of non-visible remnants on similar\norbits to the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars in comparison to equivalent first-\npass stripping models, adding in late-stripped giants can increase\nthe accretion rate onto the black hole from tidal stripping by a factor\nof a few. Since there can be a significant time delay associated with\nlower-mass stars reaching their maximum radii, the late-stripping\nSgr A\u2217 cluster population is likely to change with age and will ini-\ntially be much more top-heavy in mass than the input population.\n3.2 IMF\nSince the scattering probability varies inversely with mass, scatter-\ning from an initially Salpeter-IMF reservoir of stars leads to a sig-\nnificantly bottom-heavy mass distribution for stars that pass within\na tidal radius of the black hole. This is compounded by the short\n6 L. M. Dray, A. R. King and M. B. Davies\nlifetimes of the more massive stars. However, it is those more mas-\nsive stars which have sufficient luminosity to be observed in the\nGC region. Of a \u2018normal\u2019 Salpeter-like first-pass stripped popula-\ntion only around one star per 38000 is initially above 5M\u2299. With\na scattering rate of \u223c 5\u00d710\u22124 starsyr\u22121 this obviously produces a\nvery poor fit to the observed population of around 20 luminous Sgr\nA\u2217 cluster stars1.\nThough there remains the possibility that the scattering rate\ncould be higher than the Wang & Merritt one (e.g. Holley-\nBockelmann & Sigurdsson 2006), a large enough scattering rate\nwould also violate other constraints imposed by observations of the\nGC region, requiring in particular an extremely large population of\nnon-visible stellar remnants (Goodman & Paczynski 2005; see also\nsection 4.4.1).\nThere are two plausible effects which may help in increasing\nthe Sgr A\u2217 cluster population without increasing the scattering rate,\nhowever. Firstly, many of the scattered stars come from the cen-\ntral region of the Galaxy itself. The simulations of Merritt & Szell\n(2006) suggest a lower limit of 10\u22124 stellar tidal disruptions per\nyear for stars from the central cusp region, i.e. the inner few par-\nsecs. There are numerous indications that the GC region may have a\ntop-heavy IMF (Nayakshin & Sunyaev 2005). The present-day MF\nof the Arches cluster (around 30pc in projection from the central\nblack hole) may have a turn-over at masses as large as 6M\u2299 (Stolte\net al. 2005). Top-heavy IMFs with lower mass limits of 1M\u2299 or\nmore can be a natural consequence of star formation in dense gas\nwith a high opacity, such as in the GC region (Larson 2006).\nSecondly, as discussed above, adding in a population of late-\nscattered stars favours more massive, faster-evolving stars which\nreach larger radii.\nAs well as running our simulations with a \u2018normal\u2019 IMF (we\nuse the IMF given in Kroupa (2001), which has a Salpeter-like\nslope for massive stars and a lower limit of 0.01M\u2299), we also run\nsimulations with input IMFs which have lower mass limits at 1M\u2299\n(leading to one in 2500 stars above 5M\u2299), 3M\u2299 (one in 7 stars\nabove 5M\u2299) and 6M\u2299, and a hybrid IMF which assumes a rate of\n10\u22124 disruptionsyr\u22121 from a GC IMF with a turnover at 6M\u2299 and\nthe remaining 4\u00d7 10\u22124 disruptionsyr\u22121 from a normal IMF. For\nthe 3M\u2299 lower limit IMF we also run models with a relatively flat\nslope for stars above 6M\u2299, as is posited for the Arches cluster.\nWhether the top-heavy IMF models are realistic or not de-\npends on the relaxation time in the central region, since these mas-\nsive stars still have to get on to the loss cone. The lives of more\nmassive stars are short. If the relaxation time is much greater than\nthe main-sequence lifetime of potential Sgr A\u2217 cluster-star progen-\nitors, then it is unlikely that enough of them are scattered. In partic-\nular, if the relaxation time is 109 years then this suggests very little\ntidal stripping is possible from our top-heavy IMFs. Realistically,\nwe require either a relaxation time below 108 years or else that the\ncurrent spatial distribution of stars in the central region (in particu-\nlar the two inclined disks rotating in opposite directions) has some\neffect on the rate of stars scattering towards the black hole. The high\nscattering rate from the cusp region calculated by Merritt & Szell\n1 A 5 \u2013 6M\u2299 star stripped on the RGB can live for 1 \u2013 2\u00d7107 years; since\nthe scattering probability increases with radius, about a third of the scattered\n> 5M\u2299 stars are post-main sequence. For about 5\u00d7105 \u2013 106 years of this\ntime they are observable in the K-band under conditions appropriate for the\nGalactic Centre. As stars below this mass spend shorter periods of their lives\nvisible and blue, a rough calculation gives an Sgr A\u2217 cluster population over\n300 times too small.\nFigure 3. HR diagram showing K-band contours (dashed lines) from K = 10\nto 20. The observed Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars lie between 14 and 16.8 (Eisenhauer\net al. 2005). Also shown are unstripped stellar tracks for 2.7, 4, 5.9, 8.8 and\n13.3 M\u2299 stars (grey) and, for reference, a portion of the stripped track for\nthe 8.8 M\u2299 RGB base star shown in figure 1 (black solid line).\nonly includes the contribution of stars at r < 0.7 pc, so the relax-\nation time of this region is appropriate here. Scho\u00a8del et al. (2003)\nsuggest the high stellar density in the central arcsecond should lead\nto a relaxation time of less than 108 years, and this value may be\nreduced further if one takes into account the potentially-large pop-\nulation of compact remnants which are likely to also exist there2\n(Davies & King 2005) and the possible effects of resonant relax-\nation (Rauch & Tremaine 1996; Hopman & Alexander 2006). A\nlower limit slightly further out is provided by the unrelaxed stellar\ndisks at \u223c 0.4 pc. However, the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars and\nLBVs suggests they are only a few 106 years old. The top-heavy\nIMF scenarios are therefore at least not ruled out. If on the other\nhand they are not possible, then the alternative (given the evidence\nfor a top-heavy IMF in the central region) is not lower-mass star\nscattering from the central region but a reduced overall rate of scat-\ntering in which all the loss cone stars come from much further-away\nregions with more normal IMFs.\n4 OBSERVABILITY\nObservations of stars in the Galactic Centre are only possible in\nthe infrared due to the heavy visual extinction (some 35 magni-\ntudes) of the area. This presents particular problems for hot, blue\n2 Note though that if the density of objects in this region is too high then re-\npeated interactions could strip some of the envelope from input stars before\ntheir interaction with the black hole. This would reduce the orbital energy\nbudget and skew the resulting orbit distribution towards higher eccentrici-\nties.\nYoung stars in the Galactic Centre 7\nstars for which most of the energy output is far from the observ-\nable region of the spectrum. Nevertheless, H and K-band spectra\nhave been obtained for some of the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars (Ghez et al.\n2003, Eisenhauer et al. 2005). For the brightest, S0-2 (S2 in Eisen-\nhauer at el. 2005), Ghez et al. (2003) observe the H I (4 \u2013 7) Br\u03b3\nline at 2.166\u00b5m and the He I triplet at 2.11\u00b5m; other lines in the\nregion, such as N III at 2.1155\u00b5m, are not seen. They obtain an ef-\nfective temperature for the star of around 30,000K. Using the hot\nstar spectral atlas of Hanson, Conti & Rieke (1996), this led them\nto conclude that S0-2 was a late-type O star. Further observations\nby Eisenhauer et al. (2005) confirmed that the majority of the Sgr\nA\u2217 cluster stars have B star-like spectra. Interestingly, they appear\nto fall into strong-lined and weak-lined groups, suggesting some\nform of dual origin or dual evolution is going on.\nHowever, for many types of massive star there is a significant\namount of overlap in IR spectral morphology (Morris et al. 1996)\nleading to potential confusions in classification. Whilst it is difficult\nto find template spectra for stars which have undergone similar evo-\nlution to our putative Sgr A\u2217 cluster-forming process, to a first ap-\nproximation they will appear similar to B stars (R. Napiwiotzki, pri-\nvate communication). Those stars which fall into the observable re-\ngion shown above have surface gravities, luminosities and effective\ntemperatures in ranges which are similar to B stars. One important\nconstraint imposed by the spectra is that a significant surface hy-\ndrogen abundance must remain. However, whilst the stripped stars\nwhich remain luminous enough to be observed display He-enriched\nsurface abundances after envelope stripping, nearly all retain a sur-\nface H mass fraction of between 0.1 and 0.6. Those which retain\nmore envelope have higher surface H abundances; stars which lose\ntheir entire envelopes have, of course, rather low surface H (< 0.12\nby mass fraction).\nTo gain a rough idea of which stars will be visible, we cal-\nculate K-band limits assuming a distance modulus to the Galactic\nCentre of 14.6. For the K-band extinction we use the average value\nfound by Blum, Sellgren & DePoy (1996), AK \u223c 3.3. However the\nauthors note that AK is rather variable, and can reach \u223c 6 in places.\nTabulated bolometric corrections and V \u2212K colours are taken from\nJohnson (1966). The resulting K contours are shown in Fig. 3. It is\napparent that red stars in the galactic centre region are significantly\nmore observable than blue stars.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the effect of IMF and amount of envelope\nremaining on the HR diagram positions of the stripped stars. It is\napparent, as noted previously, that the \u2018normal\u2019 IMF populations\ncannot reproduce a luminous-enough group of stars. In addition,\nunless nearly all of the envelope is removed, they produce a pop-\nulation of relatively low-luminosity red stars which will be visible\nin the K-band. It is thus unlikely that a normal-IMF first-pass pop-\nulation will be able to reproduce the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars even if\nthe scattering rate is higher than previously assumed. However, the\npopulations with top-heavy IMFs produce a number of luminous\nblue stars, although many of these populations also produce some\nred stars as well. For simulations including only first-pass strip-\nping the visible populations are generally blue, but insufficiently\nnumerous. This can be seen in snapshots taken at points during the\nsimulations, as in Fig. 5.\nIn Fig. 6 we show some output models from the late-stripping\npopulation, i.e. the population including main-sequence stars which\nscatter onto the giant loss cone and are stripped on a later pass of the\nblack hole when they have evolved to larger radii. It is notable that\nthe population is much-increased; the effective scattering rate for\ngiant stars is much higher in this scenario. Models which are top-\nFigure 4.

Whilst exclud-\ning models which produce a few red stars does not rule every model\nout, it does rather restrict the parameter space over which the mod-\nels work. Of course, we could simply seeing the Galactic Centre\nat an unusual time when the red star population is low. However,\nthe existence and observability of these model red stars may not be\nguaranteed.\nOne possible reason that we might not see any red stars in the\nGalactic Centre, even though we predict some on close orbits, is\nthat most such stars are convective and have relatively large radii.\nEven if they are not overflowing their tidal lobes, the magnitude of\ntidal effects on stars with convective envelopes is much greater than\nthat on stars with radiative envelopes (see e.g. Hurley et al. 2002).\nThis arises from the different dissipation mechanisms operating in\neach case. Stars which are not overflowing their tidal lobes but pass\nwithin a few rtidal of the black hole are still subject to smaller-scale\ntidal interaction at periastron (Novikov et al. 1992).

Novikov et al. suggest that this\ncould lead to the destruction of the star in a few orbits, with the\nenergy deposited exceeding the total binding energy. Such a mech-\nanism could efficiently rid the Sgr A\u2217 cluster of its red members.\nFor example, if we remove from our sample of stars those which\nhave convective envelopes and pass within 3rtidal at pericentre, this\neffectively gets rid of all but the least massive red stars.\nA further complication is the effect of their extreme envi-\nronment on their appearance. It has been suggested (Jimenez et\nal 2006) that irradiation of giant stars by even a relatively low-\nluminosity AGN can, via the destruction of molecules in their at-\nmospheres, make them appear significantly bluer. They claim such\nstars would have a similar appearance to the weak-lined Sgr A\u2217\ncluster population. Such a claim should be handled cautiously,\nsince irradiation typically affects predominantly the side of the star\nfacing the radiation source, and it is unlikely that all the weak-lined\nSgr A\u2217 cluster stars are fortuitously presenting their irradiated faces\nFigure 6.

It does, however, suggest that even\nif we produce what should look like giants on Sgr A\u2217 cluster star\norbits they are not guaranteed to appear to be so. Putting into our\nsimulations the level of apparent surface temperature increase sug-\ngested by the simulations of Jimenez et al. we find a relatively mild\neffect on the overall populations, certainly not enough to pass off\nmost red stars as members of the Sgr A\u2217 cluster.\nOverall, we find a significantly better fit with top-heavy IMF\npopulations and with smaller amounts of remaining envelope. In\nparticular, if more than a small proportion of input stars are of rel-\natively low mass we find too great a population of low-luminosity\nbut still visible red stars, which cannot be explained away by either\nof the above mechanisms. In fact, the absence of such observed\nstars could place an upper limit on the scattering rate of stars from\noutside the central region (see section 5). Whilst the orbits that we\nfind for these low-mass stars are wider and more eccentric than both\nthose of the more massive stars and the observed Sgr A\u2217 cluster or-\nbits, implying that they spend most of their lives far from pericen-\ntre where they may be less observable, we generate a large enough\nnumber of them in these cases that we would still expect some to\nbe visible. That we do not suggests that, if this model for the Sgr\nA\u2217 cluster is to work, the input population is largely drawn from the\ncentral region itself. For example, late-scattering with a 6M\u2299 lower\nIMF limit produces a plausible Sgr A\u2217 cluster star population (Fig.\nYoung stars in the Galactic Centre 9\n7) for the scattering rate we use, and in general input IMFs which\nare lacking in stars below 3M\u2299 can be made to produce plausible\nSgr A\u2217 cluster populations for scattering rates which are not much\ndifferent.\nThe division by Eisenhauer et al. (2005) and others of the Sgr\nA\u2217 cluster star spectra into two classes suggests the possibility of\ntwo separate observable populations. There are a number of possi-\nble explanations for this within the framework of our model. Firstly,\nit is interesting to note that the simulations of Jimenez et al. (2006)\nsuggest spectra similar to those of the weak-lined population may\nbe produced by the irradiation of giants. In some of our simulations\nwe find some giants amongst our Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars. It could be\nthat, when irradiated, these make up the weak-lined population and\nthe initially-blue stars make up the strong-lined population. How-\never as noted previously, the sort of temperature increases they pre-\ndict are not enough to make a significant difference to the red stars\nthat we find. It is also possible, if some of the input stars are sup-\nplied by a top-heavy IMF and some are supplied by a \u2018normal\u2019\nIMF, that we are seeing two populations with different input mass\ndistributions. Finally, the evolutionary tracks of many of our more\nluminous stripped stars take them into the K-band visible region on\nthe HR diagram twice: once moving bluewards shortly after strip-\nping, and once moving back a little way redwards after a period on\nthe helium main sequence.\n4.2 Orbits\nFor both potential populations, the resulting post-stripping orbits\nare governed by the fraction of the envelope which is lost in tidal\ndisruption, as this determines the energy budget available. Detailed\nSPH simulations are ongoing to determine the outcome of the strip-\nping process (Dale et al., in preparation). At present it is an un-\nknown, so we treat the amount of envelope remaining as a free\nparameter. Constraints are introduced, as in the previous section,\nby the requirement that the stripped star population is luminous\nenough to be observable (difficult if no envelope is left) and mostly\nblue (difficult if 5% or more of the envelope is left). This may be\nseen in Fig. 4.\nWe consider primarily the situations in which 5, 1 and 0% of\nthe envelope remains. Since a great deal of the envelope binding\nenergy is concentrated in the region nearest the core, these sce-\nnarios have significant differences in available energy budget. In\nparticular, for stars with 5 % or more of the envelope remaining,\nthe relatively low amount of energy extracted leads to a distribu-\ntion of orbits which are rather weakly-bound. As the periastron dis-\ntance is constrained by the need to initially pass close to the central\nblack hole, this leads to very high typical eccentricities \u2013 0.99 or\nmore. The same applies to populations with a large proportion of\nlow-mass stars, which also have smaller envelope binding energies.\nThis includes the \u2018normal\u2019-IMF population. These highly-eccentric\norbits provide a poor match to the sample of Sgr A\u2217 cluster orbits\nwhich are known (see e.g. table 2 of Eisenhauer et al. 2005). Whilst\nthe Sgr A\u2217 cluster orbits are eccentric, their measured eccentrici-\nties range from 0.36 to 0.94. However, the models which produce\nunrealistic orbits are also those which have been previously ruled\nout for producing too many red stars. Stars from top-heavy IMFs\nand those which have more envelope removed, favoured as Sgr A\u2217\ncluster star progenitors in the previous section, also provide the best\nmatch here. The greater the amount of envelope removed, the better\nthe fit we find to observed orbits. Shown in Fig. 8 are snapshot or-\nbital distributions for some of our models which produce plausible\nluminosity distributions.\nAlthough the parameters of three of the six Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars\nwhich have detailed orbital solutions (S12, S14 and S8) are easy to\nmatch with observable models, the star with the best-determined or-\nbit, S2, is slightly outside the area in eccentricity and periastron oc-\ncupied by our models, and the two relatively low-eccentricity stars,\nS1 and S13, are well outside this region. This suggests later orbital\nevolution after the initial stripping event. As discussed in Davies &\nKing (2005), such orbits could be produced by scattering interac-\ntions with other stars in the central region after the initial stripping\nevent \u2013 a not entirely surprising happening since, as we have al-\nready discussed, the relaxation time in the central region needs to\nbe small for the model to work in the first place. The relaxation time\nin the central arcsecond is likely to be less than 108 yr (Scho\u00a8del et\nal. 2003), perhaps as low as 107 yr (Davies & King 2005) given the\nlarge number of compact remnants (white dwarfs, plus some neu-\ntron stars and black holes) which are likely to be there. Typically,\nmany of the cluster stars which are observable in the top-heavy IMF\nmodel live around 1 \u2013 2\u00d7107 yr after stripping. The portion of the\ntracks for which the star is visible varies from star to star but, whilst\nsome stars are visible for a period of time just after stripping, a sub-\nstantial portion of the visible time generally occurs near the end of\nthe stripped star\u2019s life. Thus it is plausible that some of the Sgr A\u2217\ncluster stars have undergone one post-stripping scattering event.\nAnother possibility is that, even though the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars\ndo not overflow their tidal lobes at pericentre, smaller-scale tidal\neffects are still occurring, leading to a slow circularisation of the\norbit similar to orbital circularisation in massive binaries.\n4.3 Rotation\nThe Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars have been observed to have rotation rates\ntypical of main-sequence B stars (Eisenhauer et al. 2005). In our\nscenario for their origin, the rotation rate depends largely on the\ndetails of the envelope removal process. Since we are here treating\nthat process as a \u2019black box\u2019, it is not possible to comment too\ndeeply on the rotational rates. However, it is likely that the stripping\nprocess will induce at least some rotational velocity change in the\nstar. Diener et al. (1995) find the effect of tidal interaction on their\ninitially non-rotating model stars is to produce both rotation and\noscillation.\n4.4 Further Population constraints\nBesides producing Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars like those observed, there\nare a number of other common-sense constraints on which popula-\ntions are acceptable.\n4.4.1 There should not be too massive a collection of remnants\norbiting the black hole\nOne of the chief complaints of Goodman & Paczynski (2005) re-\ngarding an AGB star origin for the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars is that a\nsufficiently large population of stripped AGB stars (which only re-\nmain in the observable region for a short time) to reproduce ob-\nservations would lead to an unreasonably large mass of non-visible\nremnants orbiting the black hole (white dwarfs, neutron stars and\nsome black holes, depending on the IMF). Whilst the stripped RGB\nand horizontal branch stars which make up the bulk of the Sgr A\u2217\ncluster in our scenario remain visible for a longer time, this is still\npotentially a problem. Several factors affect the mass of remnants\nin the central region. Firstly, the amount of mass which enters the\n10 L. M. Dray, A. R. King and M. B. Davies\nFigure 7. Cumulative K distribution for the populations shown in Fig. 6. Shown for each input population are snapshot K distributions at 1 (solid line), 2\n(dashed line), 3 (dot-dashed line) and 4 (dotted line) \u00d7109 years, against the observed distribution (Ghez et al. 2005, in grey).\nregion has a strong effect. Top-heavy IMF models generally leave\nmore massive remnants, so even if the number of stars coming in\nis the same the total remnant mass is greater. For example, \u2018nor-\nmal\u2019 first-pass IMF models leave a few hundred to a few thousand\nsolar masses of orbiting remnants, generally towards the lower end\nof this range. This is because most stars which encounter the black\nhole are disrupted entirely. For top-heavy IMFs the remnant mass\ncan be closer to a few 105 solar masses. However the total number\nof remnants is similar to that for \u2018normal\u2019 IMFs; the difference is\nthat each remnant is more massive.\nSecond, the mass of orbiting remnants is greater for the late-\nstripping populations. This is unsurprising, since a much larger pro-\nportion of them encounter the black hole as giants and so avoid\ncomplete shredding. For late-stripping top-heavy IMF populations\nthe remnant mass resulting can be particularly unrealistic and can\napproach the mass of Sgr A\u2217 itself in the most extreme case. This\nis problematic, since the late-stripping top-heavy IMF models pro-\nvide the best match to the K luminosity and orbital characteristics.\nHowever, the remnant mass is dependent on the scattering rate. For\nSalpeter-slope IMFs with a high lower mass limit, the scattering\nrate is not very different from the 1M\u2299,1R\u2299 scattering rate; for\nIMFs which are top-heavy because they have a flatter upper slope,\nsuch as our Arches-like IMF, the scattering rate is much lower and\nacceptable populations can still be obtained with reasonably small\nremnant masses. In addition, the above analysis assumes the loss\ncone is kept full \u2013 probably an unlikely state. If instead the scat-\ntering rate is constrained by the refilling rate of the loss cone the\nrate of disruptions may be much lower and hence the remnant mass\nstill reasonable, although this will also reduce the number of visible\nstars unless formation happens in bursts, perhaps related to recent\nstar formation in the GC region. However, this latter scenario would\nhave trouble explaining the current low luminosity of Sgr A\u2217.\nMore importantly, the above analysis of the remnant mass as-\nsumes nothing happens on the formation of a remnant and no fur-\nther interaction between remnants takes place after formation. In\nthe top-heavy IMF case, much of the mass of remnants is made\nup out of neutron stars and even some black holes. This requires\ntype II (potentially IIb or even Ib, since only a small amount of\nenvelope remains) supernovae. It is generally thought (e.g. Lyne &\nLorimer 1994) that the formation of a neutron star or black hole by\na supernova is accompanied by a large velocity kick arising from\nasymmetries either in the mass ejection or the neutrino emission.\nTherefore much of the remnant mass could in fact have been ejected\nfrom the central region, either inward (i.e. the remnant is propelled\nonto an unstable orbit, from whence it is swallowed) or outward3 .\nIf all such remnants are ejected, the total mass of orbiting remnants\nin the top-heavy late-stripping models after 1010 years decreases to\n\u223c 105M\u2299. For non-expelled remnants, interactions arising from the\nhigh density of the region may also lead to ejections. In particular,\nfeedback interactions may increase the number of ejections, with\ntemporarily-overdense regions having high ejection rates; and, if\nthere is a population of massive black holes which have migrated to\nthe central parsec by dynamical friction (Miralda-Escude\u00b4 & Gould\n3 Note that the velocity dispersion in the central region is rather large; or-\nbital speeds may be > 1000kms\u22121. The average kick value from the study\nof Lyne & Lorimer is 450kms\u22121. So this mechanism probably accounts for\nonly a portion of the remnants.\nYoung stars in the Galactic Centre 11\nFigure 8. Snapshot of Sgr A\u2217 cluster orbits at 4\u00d7 109 years, for (a) late-stripping IMF with Salpeter slope and lower limit of 6M\u2299, 1 % remaining envelope;\n(b) the same but with 0 % remaining envelope; (c) Arches-type IMF with 1 % remaining envelope; (d) First-pass stripping with lower IMF limit of 3M\u2299 and\n1% remaining envelope. Black points indicate visible, grey points non-visible Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars. Note that in general the visible stars are spread relatively\nevenly amongst the distribution of orbits. Shown also are the six current observed Sgr A\u2217 cluster orbits (Eisenhauer et al. 2005).\n2000) these will tend to eject the individually less-massive rem-\nnants from stripped-star evolution. If mergers between the central\nblack hole and other infalling SMBHs from Galaxy mergers hap-\npen periodically (Yu & Tremaine 2003), the central region is likely\nto be \u2018cleared-out\u2019 of its population of remnants when this occurs:\nin this case, the central remnant population may be only the much\nsmaller number of compact objects formed since the most recent\nSMBH merger.\nThe number of remnants is also partially dependent on the\namount of envelope which the stripping process typically removes\nfrom a star. The greater the amount of envelope the star retains, the\nmore likely it is to undergo a second expansion phase after cen-\ntral helium burning and end up as a helium giant. In this state it is\nlikely to overflow its tidal lobe a second time or at least undergo\nstrong tidal interactions (section 3.1). Several outcomes are possi-\nble for this second stripping process. If it behaves similarly to the\nfirst, one would expect a more circular orbit with the same pericen-\ntre distance to result. More probably, a second large input of energy\nand\/or repeated tidal interactions at periastron may disrupt the star\ncompletely (Novikov et al. 1992). In either case, the total mass of\nremnants is reduced.\n4.4.2 The flaring rate should be reasonable\nThe disruption of a star and subsequent accretion of its matter can\nproduce a strong X-ray flare, such as have been observed in some\nAGN (e.g. Piro et al. 1988; Brandt, Pounds & Fink 1995; Grupe,\nThomas & Leighly 1999; Donley et al. 2002). However, the time-\nscale of the tidal disruption event determines its observability, since\nvery long timescale events are not detectable as flares. Red giants\nwith large radii are amongst the stars which have a long disrup-\ntion timescale (Syer & Ulmer 1999). Therefore a larger disruption\nrate in which the increase is primarily of giant stars only, such as\nwe find in the late-stripping case, does not necessarily result in a\ngreater number of observable flares. Much of the X-ray luminosity\nfunction of active galactic nuclei may be powered by this method,\nparticularly at the low-luminosity end (Milosavljevic\u00b4, Merritt & Ho\n2006). Tidal disruption rates have frequently been calculated in the\npast with a view to working out the rates of X-ray flares (e.g. Rees\n1988; Magorrian & Tremaine 1999). More frequent minor flares\nhave also been observed in Sgr A\u2217, which could be the signatures\nof stars passing through the black hole\u2019s accretion disk (Nayakshin,\nCuadra & Sunyaev 2004).\nEven for our most extreme late-scattering models, the rate\nof tidal disruption is never more than a factor of 4.5 greater than\nfor the case in which all stars are 1M\u2299, 1R\u2299 and are stripped on\ntheir first pass. This corresponds to a maximum rate for the Galac-\ntic Centre of around 2\u00d7 10\u22123disruptionsyr\u22121 . For realistic mod-\nels which provide a reasonable fit to the observational data and\nto the other constraints discussed here the rates of tidal disrup-\ntion are generally lower. For example, the total rate of tidal dis-\nruptions in the case of the \u2018Arches\u2019 IMF is only 20% of that for\nthe 1M\u2299, 1R\u2299, first-pass stripping case. However, as yet the con-\nstraints on flaring rates are relatively weak. Donley et al. (2002)\nfind the rates to be approximately 9\u00d710\u22126galaxy\u22121 yr\u22121 for inac-\ntive and 8.5\u00d710\u22124galaxy\u22121 yr\u22121 for active galaxies. Our predicted\n12 L. M. Dray, A. R. King and M. B. Davies\nflaring rates are nearly all comfortably in this range. This is there-\nfore also a rather weak constraint on the models when compared to\nthe others.\nA further observational limit which has the potential to con-\nstrain the rate of inspirals into the black hole in the future is their\ngravitational wave emission (e.g. Hopman & Alexander 2006).\n4.4.3 The accretion rate should be reasonable\nThe tidal disruption process is also a method of black hole feed-\ning, and it is likely that at least some fraction of the stripped matter\n(perhaps around half; Rees 1988) is accreted onto the black hole.\nAlthough the current low luminosity of Sgr A\u2217 indicates that its\naccretion rate at the moment is much smaller than expected (e.g.\nBaganoff et al. 2003; Zhao, Bower & Goss 2001), it must obvi-\nously have accreted enough matter in the past in some fashion to\ngrow to its current mass. Tidal shredding is by no means the only\nmethod of feeding a black hole; at least some of the mass is likely\nto arise from gas accretion (e.g. Wada 2004). If the amount of mat-\nter accreted over 1010 years from tidal disruptions is significantly\nover 3.6\u00d7106M\u2299, this suggests the model is unrealistic. Of course,\nthe amount of accretable matter from loss cone stars changes over\nthe lifetime of the black hole, as the scattering rate depends on\nthe black hole mass. Wang & Merritt (2004) find, perhaps coun-\nterintuitively, a wider loss cone and thus greater scattering rate\nonto lower-mass black holes. The fraction of matter which is ac-\ncreted is also a matter of debate and may be rather lower than half,\nperhaps closer to 10% (Ayal, Livio & Piran 2000). Late-stripping\nmodels in general have larger amounts of accreted mass simply\nbecause more stars are stripped. Similarly top-heavy IMF models\nhave larger amounts of accreted mass because the total amount of\nmass in the stars encountering the black hole is greater. Generally\nthe models which can be rejected on these grounds are the same\nones which can be rejected on the grounds of having too great a\nmass of remnants, therefore. Top-heavy late-stripping models can\nproduce produce acceptable levels of accretion if the scattering rate\nis not too high (this occurs with flatter upper IMF slopes, for exam-\nple, so the Arches-like model is again good here) or if the fraction\nof matter accreted is closer to the Ayal et al. (2000) value than to a\nhalf.\n5 DISCUSSION\nIf the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars arise from relatively low mass progeni-\ntors, the \u2018paradox of youth\u2019 (Ghez et al. 2003) is no longer a prob-\nlem. However, it seems apparent from our models that the require-\nment for young stars is only slightly relieved; the model which\nmatches most closely to the HR diagram position of a 15M\u2299 ZAMS\nB star, for example, is an initially 9M\u2299 star which undergoes strip-\nping at an age of 29.5 Myr to remove all but about 2M\u2299 of its\nmass. But the 15M\u2299 star itself stays on the main sequence for 10\nMyr. If the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars are produced in this manner, then,\nit is likely that the disks of apparently massive young stars within a\nparsec of Sgr A\u2217 which are the next furthest objects out from them\nwere in fact formed in place (Nayakshin & Sunyaev 2005) and that\nthe nearby Galactic Centre region in general supplies many of the\nscattered stars which become visible on Sgr A\u2217 cluster orbits after\nstripping.\nThe IMF of the scattered stars is the most important ingredi-\nent in producing a plausible Sgr A\u2217 cluster model from stripped\nstars. Most top-heavy IMF models can be made to produce enough\nFigure 9. Cumulative number of visible red stars with radius expected in the\nGalactic centre from \u2018normal\u2019-IMF late-scattered stars after 4\u00d7 109 years,\nwith 1 % remaining envelope and tidal disruption rates (upper line to lower\nline) 10\u22123, 5\u00d710\u22124 ,10\u22124 and 10\u22124disruptionsyr\u22121 .\nvisible blue stars and few enough red stars with scattering rates\nwhich are in the range of those claimed in the literature. However,\nas discussed above, other constraints are important. In particular,\nthe fraction of the matter produced by stripping stars which is ac-\ncreted onto the black hole should be relatively low \u2013 a quarter or\nless \u2013 if this model is not to produce a greater mass for Sgr A\u2217 than\nis observed, and the relaxation time in the central 0.7 pc needs to be\nbelow 108 yr. The most successful model when all these constraints\nare taken into account is the late-stripping \u2018Arches-like\u2019 model. If\nthe constraints are not met, it is probable that this mechanism still\noperates at least at some level, and could therefore be responsible\nfor some of the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars.\nThe generally poor results we find with \u2018normal\u2019 IMFs may\nalso provide an interesting constraint on the tidal disruption rate\nfrom regions outside the central cusp. Stars scattered from these\nregions are likely to belong to such an IMF \u2013 in fact, it is likely\nthat they are entirely deficient in high-mass stars due to the short\nlifetimes involved. Even though lower-mass stars end up on higher-\neccentricity orbits, in the late-stripping case enough red stars are\nmade that we would still expect a population of red stars observ-\nable amongst the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars. The fact that we do not\nsee such a population potentially suggests limitations either on the\ntidal stripping rate from a full loss cone or the rate stars are scat-\ntered onto the loss cone. In Fig. 8 we plot the number of visible\nred stars likely with radius as a function of tidal disruption rate. A\nsignificant red population arises from scattering rates above about\n10\u22124disruptionsyr\u22121 .\n5.1 Observational Prospects\nObservationally, there are a number of ways that it may be pos-\nsible in the future to distinguish between this scenario and others\nfor the formation of the Sgr A\u2217 cluster. An unavoidable part of the\nstripped-star scenario is that there is a large population of single\ncompact objects, many of which will be neutron stars or even black\nholes, in the central region. This extra dark mass should cause the\norbits of the cluster stars to precess slightly (Mouawad et al. 2005;\nWeinberg, Milosavljevic\u00b4 & Ghez 2005). Whilst current telescopes\nare unable to measure the stellar orbits with enough accuracy to\nmake out this effect, future 30 \u2013 100 m Extremely Large Tele-\nscopes (ELTs) should be able to effectively weigh the extended\nmatter distribution around the black hole using this method (Wein-\nYoung stars in the Galactic Centre 13\nberg et al. 2005). There is also the possibility of observing these\nremnants directly. Pulsars orbiting Sgr A\u2217 should be visible with\nSKA (Cordes et al. 2005). Recent work (Wu et al. 2006; Deegan &\nNayakshin 2006) also suggests that single neutron stars and black\nholes may be observable in the Galactic Centre region if they can\naccrete enough gas from the local ISM to be X-ray bright. This\neffect has been suggested as an explanation for the overdensity of\nX-ray point sources towards the Galactic centre (Muno et al. 2003).\nHowever, although the absence of a cusp of compact objects would\ndisprove the stripped-stars theory, the presence of a such a cusp is\nnot in itself definitive proof as massive compact objects (5 \u2013 10M\u2299\nblack holes) are expected to migrate to the central parsec from out-\nside via dynamical friction (Miralda-Escude\u00b4 & Gould 2000), and\nsuch objects may be efficient at ejecting lower-mass stellar rem-\nnants from the area.\nWith future space-based or AO telescopes performing deeper\nobservations in the central parsec region, there exists the possibility\nof constraining the initial or at least current mass function in this\narea. As is apparent above, the stripped-stars model only works if\nthe local IMF is top-heavy. In particular, the best-fit IMF is \u2018Arches-\nlike\u2019, with a relatively flat upper slope. There are already limits on\nthe size of any potential low-mass star population from X-ray emis-\nsion (Nayakshin & Sunyaev 2005), and the extremely high WR and\nLBV population in the central parsec in comparison to other mas-\nsive clusters with a similar O and B star population (e.g. Tanner et al\n2006) suggests that the upper IMF slope may be flatter than normal.\nIn our simulations we find a distribution of cluster star luminosities\nwhich extends down below the boundary of what is currently ob-\nservable, so we would expect future deeper observations of the Sgr\nA\u2217 cluster itself to reveal more blue stars on similar orbits, as indi-\ncated in figure 7.\nFinally, there are a number of properties of the cluster stars\nthemselves which could be used to confirm or deny different theo-\nries as to their origin. Whilst the stripped cores we have produced\nappear similar to main-sequence B stars in some observational re-\nspects, they should be by no means identical. In particular, their\nsurface compositions will differ. If the Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars are B\nstars then their surface H and He abundances should be typical of\nthe metallicity of the Galactic centre region \u2013 i.e. about solar (e.g.\nNajarro et al. 2004). If they are stripped stars, then they should be\nsomewhat H-depleted, probably with a surface mass fraction of hy-\ndrogen between 0.6 and 0.1, and these surface abundances should\nvary strongly from star to star. As the orbit is dependent on the\namount of envelope removed, there may be correlations between\nthe periastron and eccentricity and the luminosity of the Sgr A\u2217\ncluster stars which could be investigated in the larger sample of\nstars and orbital solutions available from deeper observations. Here\nwe would expect a slight correlation between high luminosity and\nlowish eccentricity \u2013 however, this may be wiped out entirely if\nfurther scattering events take place to form the low-eccentricity or-\nbits (section 4.2). A much more definite test would be if we were\nlucky enough to observe a supernova amongst these stars, since we\nexpect some of our top-heavy IMF models to undergo type IIb su-\npernovae. B stars on the same orbits probably avoid supernovae;\nonce they evolve to larger radii, it seems probable that they are\ncompletely disrupted by tidal interactions with the hole.\n5.2 Central Star Clusters in Other Galaxies\nIt is interesting to note that the mass of the central black hole is crit-\nical in this picture in deciding whether a central cluster like the one\nobserved can be formed and what its characteristics are. There have\nalready been observations suggestive of central clusters of young\nstars in other galaxies (e.g. Lauer et al. 1998), and it is likely that if\nthe stripped-stars mechanism operates in our own Galactic centre\nit also operates in others. This raises the possibility of observing\nclusters analogous to the Sgr A\u2217 one around other SMBHs, and\nthe question of what properties such clusters would have. Firstly,\nthe scattering rate depends on m6,BH (where m6,BH is the black\nhole mass in units of 106M\u2299) roughly as m\u22120.256,BH (Merritt & Wang\n2004), i.e. a black hole of a few 108M\u2299 should, discarding any\nother effects, have a Sgr A\u2217-like cluster only one-third as numerous\nas the Galactic one. Secondly, the Schwarzschild radius is greater\nfor more massive black holes. For black hole masses comparable\nto that of Sgr A\u2217 the Schwarzschild radius is only a few solar radii\nand most solar-type stars passing within a tidal radius of the black\nhole are disrupted rather that directly swallowed. However the ratio\nof Schwarzschild radius to tidal radius is approximately\nRSch\nRT\n\u223c 2.1\u00d710\u22122\nm\u2217m\n2\n6,bh\nr\u2217\n(3)\nwhere m\u2217 and r\u2217 are the mass and radius of the scattered star in\nsolar units (e.g. Beloborodov et al. 1992, Ivanov & Chernyakova\n2006). Black holes of a few 108M\u2299 will therefore swallow solar-\ntype stars directly rather than tidally disrupting them and accreting\nsome of the gas. Many of the visible Sgr A\u2217 cluster stars in our\nfirst-pass models arise from horizontal branch (HB) stars, as this\nis the longest phase during which the star has a well-defined core.\nAs HB stars are also the most compact of the potential progenitor\nstars, they will be the first section of the progenitor population to be\nswallowed rather than stripped as black hole mass increases. Taking\ntypical values of mass and radius for HB stars which are visible\nas Sgr A\u2217-like cluster stars when stripped suggests that the black\nhole mass above which the Sgr A\u2217-like cluster population drops\ndramatically should be around 1010M\u2299 \u2013 i.e. this effect will be\nvery small in most cases. However, the fate of lower-mass stars and\nthereby potentially the fraction of gas from scattered stars which\naccretes should be significantly different at the upper and lower\nends of the known SMBH mass spectrum. In particular, whilst the\nscattering rate may be lower for more massive black holes (Wang\n& Merritt 2004) there is a mild compensatory effect in terms of\nextra mass accretion. The observation of clusters obeying the mass\nrelation above in other galaxies would act as significant evidence in\nfavour of this method of forming the Sgr A\u2217 cluster.\nThe effect of black hole mass on scattering rate is also impor-\ntant if tidal stripping is to be considered as a general AGN fuelling\nmechanism (Milosavljec, Merritt & Ho 2006). As noted above, the\namount of mass supplied in this way is certainly sufficient for such\na process. The decrease in loss cone angle as the black hole mass\nincreases suggests that in this picture it is the early life of the mas-\nsive black hole which is characterised by more rapid accretion and\nthat the growth of supermassive black holes gradually slows down\nwith time. However, the evolution of massive black holes is un-\nlikely to be this simple. If galaxy mergers are a frequent event then\nthere are likely to be phases in which the black holes at the centres\nof some galaxies are binaries. Such a situation can cause a large\nincrease in the tidal disruption rate (Ivanov, Polnarev & Saha 2005)\nand will also have a strong disruptive effect on any pre-existing Sgr\nA\u2217-like cluster, with a high ejection rate from the central region (Yu\n& Tremaine 2003).\n14 L.
