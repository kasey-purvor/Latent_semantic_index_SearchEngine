INTRODUCTION \nANY engineering problems, such as, parametric \nestimation problems [1], identification problems [2], \narray pattern synthesis problems [3], window, filter, filter \nbank and wavelet kernel design problems [4]-[19], as well as \noptimal control problems [20]-[24], can be formulated as \noptimization problems subject to functional inequality \nconstraints. Since continuous functions consist of infinite \nnumber of discrete points, these infinite constraint \noptimization problems cannot be solved via some simple \nmethods. \nIn order to solve these problems, numerically efficient \nsimplex extension algorithms were employed in [6] and [16], \nconventional dual parameterization approaches were \nemployed in [5], [12], [17], [18] and [27], an extended active \nset strategy was employed in [4], an extended version of \nRemez algorithm was employed in [7] to generate a feasible \nstarting condition for the dual method, discretization methods \nwere employed in [9], [15] and [16], outer-approximation \ncutting plane algorithms were employed in [10], [15] and [30], \npenalty function approaches were employed in [11] and [26], \nand constraint transcription approaches were employed in [13] \nand [25]. Among them, the constraint transcription methods, \nthe penalty function approaches, the discretization methods, \nthe cutting plane methods and the conventional dual \nparameterization methods are the most common methods \nemployed for solving engineering problems. \nHowever, for the constraint transcription method [25], it \nsuffers from convergence problems. For the penalty function \napproach [11], it suffers from disadvantages of computing \nnumerical integration. For the discretization method [9], it \ndoes not guarantee that the solution obtained would satisfy the \ncorresponding continuous constraints. For the cutting plane \nmethod [30], the corresponding subset of the index set may \nconsist of infinite number of points and only approximated \nsolution is obtained. On the other hand, the dual \nparameterization method is capable of finding the exact \nsolution because a global solution of the parameterized dual \nproblems provides a solution to the primal problems. \nFor the conventional dual parameterization method, it is to \nparameterize the measure \u03bc  in the dual problems so that it \ntransforms the semi-infinite programming problems into \nequivalent finite dimensional nonlinear programming \nproblems via sequences of regular convex programs. These \nsequences of convex programs are obtained by discretization. \nIn the kPthP iteration, the problems are solved by replacing the \nindex set \u0394  with a finite subset k\u0394 . The finite subset 1+\u0394 k  of \nthe index set is constructed from k\u0394  by adding all violated \nindex points of a refined set of grid points to k\u0394  while \ndropping all unnecessary points from k\u0394 . However, as the \nnumber of all violated index points in a continuous set could \nbe very large or even infinite, so the shortcoming of this \nscheme is that the number of points in k\u0394  may be unbounded \nas k  increases. For example, the number of points that \nviolates 12 \u2212>\u2212 x  is infinity because there are infinite number \nof points in the set ( )1,1\u2212\u2208x . Even if the number of points in \nk\u0394  is finite, the computational complexity of employing this \napproach for solving the problem may be very huge because \nthe number of points in k\u0394  may be very large. In this paper, \nthis conventional dual parameterization method is improved as \nfollows. We construct \n1+\u0394k  from k\u0394  by adding to k\u0394  only one \nof the most violated points in a refined set of grid points. \nHence, the number of points in k\u0394  is bounded. For the same \nexample, the most violated point is at 0=x  and we only add \nthis point in k\u0394 . \nIt is shown in this paper that for each k , the number of \npoints in k\u0394  is limited by the number of filter coefficients \nrequired to be designed plus two. The computational \ncomplexity of the dual parameterization algorithm does not \nEfficient Algorithm for Solving Semi-infinite \nProgramming Problems and Their Applications \nto Nonuniform Filter Bank Designs \nCharlotte Yuk-Fan Ho P1 P, Student Member, IEEE, Bingo Wing-Kuen LingP2 P, Yan-Qun Liu P3 P, Peter \nKwong-Shun TamP4 P, Member, IEEE, and Kok-Lay TeoP5 P, Senior Member, IEEE \nM \nT-SP-03324-2005.R2 \n \n \n2\n2\nonly depend on the filter lengths, but also on the number of \npoints in the refined sets of grid points. Hence, the \ncomputational complexity of this algorithm is greatly reduced \ncompared to the conventional one [27]. It is worth noting that \nboth the order of the optimization problem and the number of \npoints in the refined sets of grid points for the nonuniform \nfilter bank design problems are high. This is because more \nthan one filter is required to be designed and the orders of the \npolynomials for the amplitude and aliasing distortions are \nmuch higher than that for the specifications on the passband \nand stopband of the filters. Hence, the complexity issue is \nparticularly important for the nonuniform filter bank design \nproblems. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, \nwe summarize the formulation of the optimum nonuniform \nsymmetric\/anti-symmetric linear phase FIR filter bank design \nproblem as a quadratic semi-infinite programming problem \n[18]. In Section III, an improved dual parameterization \nalgorithm for solving the semi-infinite programming problem \nis proposed. In Section IV, a numerical experiment for this \nnonuniform filter bank design problem is presented. Finally, \nSection V concludes the paper. \nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION \nIn this paper, either symmetric or anti-symmetric FIR filters \nare designed, so all the filters are linear phase. The \nformulation of this optimum nonuniform symmetric\/anti-\nsymmetric linear phase FIR filter bank design problem is \nsimilar to that of the nonuniform transmultiplexer design \nproblem [18], so only the summary of the formulation is stated \nin this paper. For interested readers, we recommend them to \nstudy [18]. \nLet the coefficient vectors of the analysis and synthesis \nfilters be, respectively, x  and y . By arbitrarily choosing a set \nof synthesis filters, y  is fixed. Define the cost function of an \noptimization problem as the sum of the ripple energy for all \nthe individual filters in the passband and stopband subject to \nthe specifications on the passband and stopband ripple \nmagnitudes, as well as on the amplitude and aliasing \ndistortions. Using similar approach in [18], the nonuniform \nfilter bank design problem can be formulated as the following \nsemi-infinite programming problem: \nProblem (P) \nx\nmin  ( ) pJ TT ++= xbxQxx\n2\n1 , \nsubject to 0cxAxg \u2264\u2212= )()(),( \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 , for \u0394\u2208\u03c9 , \nwhere ( )xJ  is the cost function, 0xg \u2264),( \u03c9  is the continuous \nconstraint function, Q  is a positive definite matrix, b  is a \nvector, p  is a positive scalar, ( )\u03c9A  and ( )\u03c9c  are continuously \ndifferentiable functions with respect to some frequency band \n\u0394 . \nSince amplitude and aliasing distortions are complex \ncontinuous functions, constraints that take absolute values on \nthese functions are equivalent to quadratic constraints, which \ncause the problem to be very difficult to solve. One common \nway to tackle this difficulty is via a discretization approach. If \nthe discretization approach is employed, then the constraints \nbecome convex quadratic constraints which will lead to a \nquadratic programming problem. However, the number of \ngrid points required is very large. As a result, the \ncomputational complexity is very high. Hence, in this \nformulation, we make an approximation that the constraints on \ntaking absolute values of these complex functions are almost \n(but not) equivalent to constraints on both the real and \nimaginary parts of these functions. The approximation is valid \nif the constraint functions are small. By making such \napproximation, the quadratic constraints can be approximated \nas linear constraints and the problem is much simplified and \nbecome easier to solve. \nProblem P can be efficiently solved using the improved \ndual parameterization method and discussed in the following \nsection in detail. The problem is convex, so any local solution \nis a global solution and the solution obtained is independent of \nthe initial values of x  and y  we select. Once we obtain the set \nof analysis filters, we use the same method to compute the \nsynthesis filters, and iterate the above procedures. Since the \nfeasible set of each iteration is convex, this iteration process is \nactually a projection on a convex set. Hence, the convergence \nof the iteration process is guaranteed if a solution exists for \neach iteration. Eventually, a set of analysis and synthesis \nfilters that globally minimizes the cost function and satisfies \nthe continuous constraints is obtained. \nIII. IMPROVED DUAL PARAMETERIZATION ALGORITHM \nAs discussed in Section I, the conventional dual \nparameterization method is to parameterize the measure in the \ndual problems so that it transforms the semi-infinite \nprogramming problems into equivalent finite dimensional \nnonlinear programming problems via sequences of regular \nconvex programs. The basic working principle of the \nconventional dual parameterization method can be \nsummarized as follows: Since the constraint functions are \ncontinuous with respect to their index parameters and the \nindex set is compact Hausdorff, the constraint functions can \nbe redefined as an operator whose range is the Banach space \nconsisting of continuous functions defined on the index set \nand equipped with the uniform norm. The order in the range \nspace is given by a cone consisting of all nonnegative \nfunctions on the index set. The assumption of the conventional \ndual parameterization method is the existence of a solution \nthat strictly satisfies the continuous constraints. This condition \nis also known as the Slater\u2019s condition. Once the Slater\u2019s \ncondition is satisfied, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) \nconditions would be satisfied, which guarantees a necessary \noptimality condition for such a cone-constrained nonlinear \nprogramming problem, where the Lagrange multiplier is \ndefined as a regular Borel measure on the index set. As a \nresult, the set of multipliers satisfying the KKT condition \nnecessarily includes a measure with finite support unless it is \nT-SP-03324-2005.R2 \n \n \n3\n3\nempty. Hence, any constraint qualification ensures the \nexistence of such a discrete measure, which is also called the \nHaar measure. On the other hand, strong duality holds for \nconvex programming under Slater\u2019s constraint qualification. \nHence, the corresponding dual problem for semi-infinite \nprogramming can then be formulated in the space of finite \nsigned regular Borel measures on the index set. The local \nKKT theory and the global duality theory are naturally related \nthrough the fact that the set of multipliers satisfying the KKT \ncondition coincides with the set of solutions to the dual \nproblem, which leads to the consequence that the set of dual \nsolutions always includes a measure with finite support under \nthe Slater condition. Hence, the conventional dual \nparameterization method is guaranteed to obtain a globally \noptimal solution that satisfies the continuous constraint if a \nsolution exists. \nIn order to reduce the computational complexity of the \nconventional dual parameterization method, we need to define \nthe dual problem, the Slater condition and the KKT condition \nas follows: \nThe Dorn\u2019s dual of problem P can be formulated as \nfollows: \nProblem (DP) \n\u03bdx,\nmin  ( )( ) ( )\u222b\n\u0394\n+ \u03c9d\u03c9 TT \u03bdcxQx\n2\n1 , \nsubject to ( )( ) ( ) 0\u03bdAbxQ =++ \u222b\n\u0394\n\u03c9d\u03c9 T , \n ( )\u0394\u039b\u2208 +\u03bd , \nwhere ( )\u0394\u039b+  is the set of nonnegative bounded regular Borel \nmeasures on \u0394 . \nAs discussed in the above, in order to solve the problem \nsequence, we need an assumption of the satisfaction of the \nSlater condition, and it is stated as follows: \nAssumption 1 Slater condition \nS\u211c\u2208\u2203 0x  such that ( ) 0xg <\u03c9,0 , \u0394\u2208\u2200\u03c9 , where S  is the \ndimension of the vector \n0x . \nFor the nonuniform filter bank design problem, this \nassumption can be interpreted as follows: there exists a set of \nfilter coefficients such that the maximum values of the \namplitude and aliasing distortions, as well as the passband and \nstopband ripple magnitudes of the filters, are strictly lower \nthan that of the required specifications. If the set of \ndecimation integer is compatible, then this assumption can be \neasily achieved by using a set of filters with suitably long \nfilter lengths. \nAs discussed in the above, the dual parameterization \ntechnique is based on the dual parameterization theory, in \nwhich the dual parameterization theory is based on the \nfollowing results: \nLemma 1 KKT condition \nAssume that the Slater constraint qualification is satisfied. \nThe minimum of problem P is achieved at \u2217x  if and only if \u2217x  \nis feasible and there exists a ( )\u0394\u039b\u2208\u2217\u03bd  such that \n ( )( ) ( ) 0\u03bdAbxQ =++ \u222b\n\u0394\n\u2217\u2217 \u03c9d\u03c9 T , (1a) \n ( ) ( )( ) ( ) 0=\u2212\u222b\n\u0394\n\u2217\u2217 \u03c9d\u03c9\u03c9 T \u03bdcxA , (1b) \nand \n 0\u03bd \u2265\u2217 , (1c) \nwhere ( )\u0394\u039b  denotes the space of all signed finite regular \nBorel measure. \nThis lemma states the necessary and sufficient condition \nrelating the minimum of problem P and the existence of \u2217\u03bd  in \nthe space of all signed finite regular Borel measure. This result \nwill be used in Lemmas 3 and 4 later. Since this result is well \nknown in the optimization community [28], we just state it \nand omit the proof. For the interested readers, we recommend \nthem to study [28]. \nLemma 2 Carath\u00e9odory Theorem \nLet U  be a subset of S\u211c . If U\n0\u03b1\n\u03b1x\n\u2265\n\u2261\u2208 coUconeU , that is, x  \nis a nonnegative linear combination of points in U , then there \nexists S  numbers of 0\u2265i\u03b1  such that \u2211\n=\n=\nS\ni\nc\nii\n1\nxx \u03b1  for some \nUci \u2208x , Si ,,2,1 L= . In order words, if coneU\u2208x , then x  \ncan be represented as a nonnegative linear combination of at \nmost S  points of U . \nThis lemma states that the measure \u2217\u03bd  has a finite support \nof no more than S  points. This lemma is also required for the \nproof of Lemma 4 which is stated later. Since this result is \nalso well known in the optimization community [28], we just \nstate it and omit the proof. Again, for the interested readers, \nwe recommend them to study [28]. \nLemma 3 \nAssume that the Slater constraint qualification is satisfied \nand the minimum of problem P is achieved at \u2217x . Then \u2217\u03bd  is \na multiplier satisfying the KKT condition if and only if ( )\u2217\u2217 \u03bdx ,  is a solution to the dual problem DP. \nThis lemma states the relationship between the satisfaction \nof KKT condition stated in Lemma 1 and the solution to the \ndual problem DP. This lemma is also required for the proof of \nLemma 4 which is stated later. Since the proof is shown in \ndetail in [27], we omit the proof in this paper. For the \ninterested readers, we recommend them to study [27]. \nLemma 4 \nAssume that the Slater constraint qualification is satisfied \nand the minimum of problem P is achieved at \u2217x . Then the \nsolution set of the dual problem DP contains a solution pair ( )\u2217\u2217 \u03bdx ,  of which the measure \u2217\u03bd  has a finite support of no \nmore than S  points. \nBased on the KKT condition stated in Lemma 1, the \nCarath\u00e9odory Theorem stated in Lemma 2 and the relationship \nbetween the satisfaction of KKT condition and the solution to \nthe dual problem DP stated in Lemma 3, the proof of Lemma \n4 can be followed easily. Since the detail proof is also shown \nin [27], we omit the proof in this paper. For the interested \nreaders, we recommend them to study [27]. \nT-SP-03324-2005.R2 \n \n \n4\n4\nLemma 4 is the foundation of the dual parameterization \nmethod. The importance of Lemma 4 is that it allows us to \nreduce problem DP to a finite dimensional problem. In order \nto solve the primal problem P, we only need to find a solution \npair ( )\u2217\u2217 \u03bdx ,  of problem DP. From Lemma 4, we can restrict \nour search for \u2217\u03bd  to those nonnegative measures having a \nfinite support of no more than S  supporting points. Such a \nmeasure \u03bd  is characterized by its k  supporting points \u0394\u2208i\u03c9  \nfor ki ,,2,1 L= , and the corresponding measures \n{ }( ) 0\u03bd\u03bc >= ii \u03c9  for ki ,,2,1 L=  at each point. If we restrict the \nmeasure \u03bd  in problem DP to those of finite support of no \nmore than k  supporting points which are collectively denoted \nby Z , then problem DP is reduced to the following problem: \nProblem ( kPDP ) \n\u03c4\u03bcx ,,\nmin  ( )( )\u2211\n=\n+\nk\ni\ni\nT\ni\nT \u03c9\n12\n1\n\u03bccxQx , \nsubject to ( )( ) 0\u03bcAbxQ =++ \u2211\n=\nk\ni\ni\nT\ni\u03c9\n1\n, \n 0\u03bc \u2265i  for ki ,,2,1 L= , \n \u0394\u2208i\u03c9  for ki ,,2,1 L= . \nwhere [ ]k\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc ,,, 21 L=  and [ ]k\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 ,,, 21 L=\u03c4 . \nProblem kPDP  is called the parameterized dual of problem \nP with parameterization number k . From the above \ndiscussions, we see that once a global solution ( )\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u03c4\u03bcx ,,  of \nproblem kPDP  is obtained, then \n\u2217x  must be the solution of \nproblem P if k  is suitably large. Here, suitably large means \nthat k  is no less than an integer \u2217k , the minimum \nparameterization number, which is no more than S , but not \nknown exactly before solving the problem. Thus, in order to \nsolve problem P, we only need to deal with problem kPDP . \nFor any finite index set { } \u0394\u2282= k\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9Z ,,, 21 L , we define \nthe following problem: \nProblem ( ( )ZPDP ) \n\u03bcx,\nmin  ( )( )\u2211\n=\n+\nk\nj\nj\nT\nj\nT \u03c9\n12\n1\n\u03bccxQx , \nsubject to ( )( ) 0\u03bcAbxQ =++ \u2211\n=\nk\nj\nj\nT\nj\u03c9\n1\n, \n 0\u03bc \u2265j  for kj ,,2,1 L= , \nwhere \u03bc  is defined as in problem kPDP . \nHence, problem P can be solved efficiently by the \nfollowing improved dual parameterization algorithm. The \nalgorithm combines an adaptive scheme for an approximated \nsolution and a local search procedure. \nFor each 1\u2265i , let i\u0394  be a given subset of \u0394  satisfying \n( ) 0minmax, \u2192\u2212\u2261\u0394\u0394 \u0394\u2208\u0394\u2208 \u03c9d i\u03c9i \u03d6\u03d6 . (2) \nFor any \u0394\u2208\u03c9  and S\u211c\u2208x , we define \n( ) ( )\u03c9g\u03c9g jmj ,max, 1max xx \u2264\u2264\u2261 , where ( )\u03c9g j ,x  is the j PthP entry of the \nvector ( )\u03c9,xg  and m  is the number of rows of ( )\u03c9,xg . \nAlgorithm 1 \nStep 1. Choose an arbitrary filter coefficient vector S\u211c\u22080x , \na small number 0>\u03b5 , a large integer N , and a \nsequence of finite parameterization sets { }iiji kj\u03c9 ,,2,1: L==\u0394 , for L,2,1=i , satisfying (2). \nStep 2. Let \u00d80 =E , where \u00d8  denotes the empty set. Set 0=i . \nStep 3. Set 1+= ii . Find  ii \u0394\u2208\u03d6  such that ( ) ( )\u03c9gg i\n\u03c9i\ni\ni\n,max, 1max\n1\nmax\n\u2212\n\u0394\u2208\n\u2212 = xx \u03d6 . \nIf ( ) \u03b5\u03d6 <\u2212 iig ,1max x , set 1\u2212= ii EZ . \nIf Ni \u2265 , go to  Step 6. \nElse, set ( ) ( )11,, \u2212\u2212= iiii \u03bcx\u03bcx , 1\u2212= ii EE  and repeat \nStep 3. \nEnd. \nElse, { }iii EZ \u03d6U1\u2212= . \nEnd. \nStep 4. Solve problem ( )iZPDP  to obtain a solution ( )ii \u03bcx , . \nStep 5.  Choose a set ii ZE \u2282  with no more than 1+S  points \nsuch that the solution of problem ( )iEPDP  is in the \nform ( )ii \u03bcx , . \nGo to Step 3. \nStep 6.  Suppose iZ  has k  points k\u03d6\u03d6\u03d6 ,,, 21 L . Starting from ( )iii \u03c4\u03bcx ,, , where ix  and i\u03bc  are defined previously \nand [ ]ki \u03d6\u03d6\u03d6 ,,, 21 L=\u03c4  is the k  tuple formed \nby the points in iZ , find a local minimum ( )\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u03c4\u03bcx ,,  \nfor problem kPDP . Then \n\u2217x  is taken as the solution \nfor problem P. \nIn Algorithm 1, we need to initialize two parameters, N  \nand \u03b5 . The purpose of introducing the integer N  is to prevent \nthe algorithm from terminating prematurely. For example, if \nthe iteration number i  is small, the subset 1+\u0394 i  may be \nrelatively sparse in \u0394  and it may happen that the \napproximated solution ix , as part of the solution ( )ii \u03bcx ,  of \nproblem ( )iZPDP , satisfies all the constraints corresponding \nto index points in \n1+\u0394 i . Without introducing the integer N , \nthe algorithm would terminate the iteration at this stage even \nif ( ) 0,max >\u03c9g ix  at some points 1\\ +\u0394\u0394\u2208 i\u03c9  and goes to the \nfinal local search procedure. In this case, ix  may not be close \nenough to the primal solution \u2217x  and the subsequent local \nsearch procedure in Step 6 does not find a global solution for \nproblem kPDP . The parameter \u03b5  relates to the tolerable error. \nTheoretically, it can be set as close as zero if the Slater \ncondition is satisfied. \nThe main difference between this algorithm and the \nconventional one [27] is that this algorithm is more efficient in \nthe sense that the dimension of the quadratic problem in each \niteration and that at the final local search procedure is much \nreduced. In the above algorithm, we can see from Step 5 that \nT-SP-03324-2005.R2 \n \n \n5\n5\nthe number of points in iE  is no more than 1+S  points. \nHence, in Step 3, if ( ) \u03b5\u03d6 \u2265\u2212 iig ,1max x , then { }iii EZ \u03d6U1\u2212=  and \nthe number of points in iZ  is no more than 2+S  points. In \nStep 3, if ( ) \u03b5\u03d6 <\u2212 iig ,1max x , then 1\u2212= ii EZ . If Ni < , then \n1\u2212= ii EE . Hence, the number of points in both iZ  and iE  is no \nmore than 1+S  points. As a result, after re-iterates of Step 3, \nthe number of points in iE  and iZ  is no more than 1+S  and \n2+S  points, respectively. According to Algorithm 1, we only \nneed to solve the problem ( )ZPDP  in Step 4 and Step 5. As \nthe dimension of the problem ( )ZPDP  is equal to the size of \nthe vector x  plus that of \u03bc , the size of the vector x  and j\u03bc  is, \nrespectively, 1\u00d7S  and 1\u00d7m , and there is no more than 2+S  \npoints in iZ  or there is no more than 2+S  j\u03bc , so we only \nneed to solve a quadratic programming problem of dimension \nnot exceeding ( )2++ SmS  with S  linear equality constraints. \nThis is because the number of equality constraints is equal to \nthe size of the vector ( )( )\u2211\n=\n++\nk\nj\nj\nT\nj\u03c9\n1\n\u03bcAbxQ , which is S . \nSimilarly, we can see that we only need to find a local solution \nof a nonlinear programming problem at the final local search \nprocedure of dimension no more than ( )( )21 +++ SmS . \nSince the dimension of the optimization problem is greatly \nreduced, one may query that the numerical accuracy of the \nobtained solution will be traded off. It is worth noting that if \nthe parameters \u03b5  and N  are chosen properly, then the \nefficiency of the improved dual parameterization method will \nnot be traded off with the numerical accuracy of the obtained \nsolution even though the dimensionality of the problem is \nreduced. Or in other words, the solution obtained using the \nimproved dual parameterization method is the same as that of \nthe conventional dual parameterization method. This is \nbecause both the conventional and the improved dual \nparameterization algorithm guarantee that the obtained \nsolution is the globally optimal solution, which is uniquely \ndefined. This result will be proved in Theorem 1 later. In \norder to prove Theorem 1, we need Lemmas 5 and 6 stated \nbelow: \nLemma 5 \nStep 5 of the Algorithm 1 is numerically feasible. \nProof \nLet { }kjZ ji ,,2,1: L== \u03c9 . Then problem ( )iZPDP  is in the \nform of ( )ZPDP . Let ( )ii \u03bcx ,  be the solution to this problem \nobtained in the iPthP iteration. Consider the following linear \nprogram: \nProblem ( iLP ) \n( )\u03c5\u03bc,min\n \u2211+\n=\n1\n1\nS\nj\nj\u03c5 , \nsubject to ( )( ) iSk\nj\nj\nT\nj \u03bd\u03c5\u03c9 =+ +\n=\n\u2211 1\n1\n\u03bcc , \n ( )( ) ik\nj\nj\nT\nj c\u03c5\u03bcA ~\u02c6\n1\n=+\u2211\n=\n\u03c9 , \n 0\u03bc \u2265 , \nand \n 0\u03c5 \u2265 , \nwhere \n ( )( )\u2211\n=\n=\nk\nj\ni\nj\nT\nji\n1\n\u03bcc \u03c9\u03bd , \n bQxc \u2212\u2212= ii~ , \n [ ]ikii \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc ,,, 21 L= , \n [ ]TS\u03c5\u03c5\u03c5 ,,,\u02c6 21 L=\u03c5  \nand \n [ ]TST 1,\u02c6 += \u03c5\u03c5\u03c5 . \nIn problem iLP , which is the phase one of a linear program, \nj\u03c5  for 1,,2,1 += Sj L  are known as artificial variables in the \nsimplex theory of linear programming. Using the simplex \nmethod, we obtain a basic feasible solution ( )ii \u03c5\u03bc ,  where i\u03c5  \nis a zero vector and i\u03bc  contains no more than 1+S  nonzero \nvectors in m\u211c . Let [ ]ikiii \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc ,,, 21 L=  and define { }0\u03bc \u2260\u2264\u2264= ijji kjE ,1:\u03c9 . We form a new tuple i\u03bc\u02c6  consisting \nof those column vectors i\nj\u03bc  in i\u03bc  whose corresponding \nindices \nj\u03c9  are in iE . Then, it is easy to see that ( )ii \u03bcx \u02c6,  is a \nsolution to problem ( )iEPDP . \u0084 \nThis lemma is important for the convergence of the \nalgorithm. \nLemma 6 \nLet { } \u0394\u2282== kjZ j ,,2,1: L\u03c9  be any finite subset of index \npoints. Then problem ( )ZPDP  is the Dorn\u2019s dual form of the \nfollowing program: \nProblem ( ( )ZP ) \nx\nmin  ( ) pJ TT ++= xbxQxx\n2\n1 , \nsubject to ( ) ( ) 0cxA \u2264\u2212 jj \u03c9\u03c9 , for kj ,,2,1 L= . \nA vector S\u211c\u2208x\u02c6  is the solution of problem ( )ZP  if and only if \nthere exists some [ ]k\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc \u02c6,,\u02c6,\u02c6\u02c6 21 L=   such that ( )\u03bcx \u02c6,\u02c6  is a \nsolution of problem ( )ZPDP . Furthermore, \n( )( ) ( )( )ZVZV PDPP \u2212= , where ( )DV  denotes the optimal \nvalue of a given problem D. \nProof \nThis lemma is easy to check and we omit the details. \u0084 \nThis lemma states the necessary and sufficient relationship \nbetween solutions of problem ( )ZP  and problem ( )ZPDP . \nHence, we can use Algorithm 1 to solve the problem ( )iZPDP  \ninstead. This result is required for Theorem 1 and is stated \nbelow. \nTheorem 1 \nIf (2) is satisfied, then the sequence { }ix  obtained from \nT-SP-03324-2005.R2 \n \n \n6\n6\nAlgorithm 1 converges to the solution of problem P. \nTherefore, assuming that problem kPDP  has only a finite \nnumber of local minima for each k , if \u03b5  and N  are suitably \nchosen, then \u2217x  obtained in Step 6 is the optimal solution of \nproblem P. \nProof \nThe proof is shown in Appendix I. \u0084 \nThe importance of Theorem 1 is that we can guarantee the \nconvergence of Algorithm 1 to the solution of problem P. \nSince the dimension of the quadratic programming does not \nexceed ( )2++ SmS  with S  linear equality constraints, \nAlgorithm 1 can be used to solve semi-infinite programming \nproblems efficiently.\n \nIV. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS \nWe have performed extensive numerical experiments, \nincluding the cases with the sets of decimation integers \n{ }4,4,2 , { }6,6,6,2  and { }6,6,3,3 . We obtain excellent results for \nall these examples. For brevity and to focus on ideas, we only \npresent the case with the set of decimation integers { }4,4,2 . \nSince this set of decimation integers corresponds to a \ncascade of uniform filter banks in a tree structure manner, an \nexact perfect reconstruction is possible if the filter lengths are \nlong enough. Hence, there should exist a solution such that the \nspecifications on aliasing and amplitude distortions are strictly \nsatisfied. That means the Slater\u2019s constraint qualification \nholds and our proposed algorithm will converge to the global \nminimum. Although the existence of a solution or the \nsatisfaction of Slater\u2019s constraint is not guaranteed if the filter \nlengths are short, the possibility of this set of decimation \ninteger getting a solution is higher than the others. \nAlthough perfect reconstruction is easy to achieve if the set \nof decimation integers is {2,4,4} even at short filter lengths, it \nis not guarantee that the passband and stopband specifications \nare satisfied. For real applications, subband processing, such \nas quantization, is applied. This subband processing is based \non the frequency selectivity of the filters. If the frequency \nselectivity of these filters is bad, then the subband processing \nmay process undesirable frequency bands. As a result, the \nperformance of the overall systems may be bad even though \nperfect reconstruction is achieved without subband \nprocessing. Hence, we sometimes tradeoff the perfect \nreconstruction conditions with good frequency selectivity \nfilters. \nIn order to guarantee that the overall system can achieve \nnear perfect reconstruction with the performance better than \nthat reported in [29], in which the amplitude distortion can be \nbounded by dB40\u2212 , the aliasing distortion can be bounded by \ndB60\u2212  and the stopband ripple magnitude is bounded by \ndB60\u2212  with 64  tap filters, we set the specifications on both \nthe real and imaginary parts of amplitude distortions as \ndB40\u2212 , and that of the aliasing distortions as well as the \nspecification on the stopband ripple magnitude as dB60\u2212 . \nFor this set of decimation integers, the passbands and the \nstopbands of the filters in the analysis bank are denoted as, \nrespectively, piB  and \ns\niB  for 2,1,0=i , and defined as follows: \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2202+\u2212= 000 2,2 BBB\np \u03c0\u03c0 , (3a) \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2212\u2202+\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2202+= 11111 2,4\n3\n4\n3,\n2\nBBBBB p \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 U , (3b) \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2212\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202+= 222 4\n3,,\n4\n3 BBB p \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 U , (3c) \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2212\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202+= 000 2,,2 BBB\ns \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 U , (3d) \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2202+\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2212\u2212= \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 ,\n4\n3\n2\n,\n24\n3, 11111 BBBBB\ns UU (3e) \nand \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2202\u2212\u2202+\u2212= 222 4\n3,\n4\n3 BBBs \u03c0\u03c0 , (3f) \nwhere \n0B\u2202 , 1B\u2202  and 2B\u2202  are the transition bandwidths of the \nlowpass filter, bandpass filter and highpass filter, respectively, \nand selected as 0.256360 =\u2202B , 0.32141 =\u2202B  and \n0.320992 =\u2202B . \nIn the improved dual parameterization algorithm, we \nchoose 001.0=\u03b5 , 10=N  and i\u0394  for L,2,1=i  as the set of \ndiscrete frequencies sampled from \u03c0\u2212  to \u03c0  with step size \n01.0 . The initial values of x  and y  of our algorithm are \nselected as the filters designed using the Matlab function \n\u201cfir1\u201d. In fact, any initial condition would give the same \nglobally optimal solution as discussed before. \nFor the same set of filter lengths employed in [29], our \ndesign can achieve the passband ripple magnitudes bounded \nby 150.9365dB\n0\n\u2212=p\u03b4 , 69.1622dB1 \u2212=p\u03b4  and \n98.8590dB\n2\n\u2212=p\u03b4 , while the stopband ripple magnitudes \nbounded by 72.4579dB\n0\n\u2212=s\u03b4 , 66.1358dB1 \u2212=s\u03b4  and \n74.1299dB\n2\n\u2212=s\u03b4 . Both the real part and imaginary part of the \namplitude distortions is less than 63.1403dB\u2212 , and both the \nreal part and imaginary part of the aliasing distortions is less \nthan 66.6287dB\u2212 . It can be checked that our proposed \nalgorithm meet all the required specifications. Figure 1 shows \nthe responses of the analysis filters and Figure 2 shows the \ncorresponding amplitude and aliasing distortions. Compared \nto the result obtained in [29], we have about 0dB2  and dB4  \nimprovements on respectively, the amplitude and aliasing \ndistortions, as well as dB126 \u2212  improvements on the stopband \nripple magnitudes of the filters. The main reasons for the \nimprovements are because the filters obtained in [29] is based \non the sum of filter responses of filters in the corresponding \nuniform cosine-modulated filter banks, which is not a globally \noptimal solution in general. \nTo compare our results with that of perfect reconstruction \nfilter banks, we implement the perfect reconstruction filter \nbanks as a tree structure. There are many filters that the filter \nlengths of the equivalent filters in the corresponding \nnonuniform filter banks are less than or equal to 64 . For \nT-SP-03324-2005.R2 \n \n \n7\n7\nexample, we can use a set of filters with filter length 32  in the \nfirst branch of the tree structure and 16  in the second branch, \nor 24  in the first branch and 20  in the second branch, etc. In \norder to make the roll-off of the frequency response of each \nfilter similar, the filter length of the filters in the first branch \nshould be approximately equal to that in the second branch. \nHence, we use 24 tap and 20 tap filters in, respectively, the \nfirst branch and second branch. Due to finite bit \nimplementation, the magnitude and aliasing distortions are \nnon-zero and found as, respectively, 285.8366dB\u2212  and \n279.8754dB\u2212 . The passband ripple magnitudes are found as \n31.9776dB\n0\n\u2212=p\u03b4 , 40.0002dB1 \u2212=p\u03b4  and 66.3320dB2 \u2212=p\u03b4 , \nwhile the stopband ripple magnitudes are as \n13.0335dB\n0\n\u2212=s\u03b4 , 17.2047dB1 \u2212=s\u03b4  and 30.2599dB2 \u2212=s\u03b4 . \nThis set of filters is far from the required specifications. \nCompared to our results, we have very significant \nimprovements on both the passband and stopband ripple \nmagnitudes. The main reasons for the improvements are \nbecause the filter lengths are too short to satisfy the passband \nand stopband specifications under the perfect reconstruction \ncondition. So if we relax the perfect reconstruction \nrequirement, better passband and stopband performances can \nbe achieved. \nFor this example, we see that our algorithm has found a \nsolution satisfying the required constraint specifications. For \nother nonuniform filter banks with other specifications, in \ngeneral, there is no guarantee that a solution exists such that \nthe required specifications are satisfied. If there is no solution \nfor a particular set of filter lengths, one may increase the filter \nlengths incrementally, run the numerical experiments again \nand check if the required specifications are satisfied. If there is \nno solution, one may need to relax the specifications. \nTo compare the computational complexity to the \nconventional dual parameterization approach [27], we find \nthat both approaches require three iterations for the \nconvergence. However, the conventional approach requires to \nsolve a standard quadratic program of dimension 23472  at the \nlast iteration, while the improved dual parameterization \nmethod only requires to solve a standard quadratic program of \ndimension 6102  at the last iteration. The reduction of the \ndimensionality of the problem results to the reduction of \nsimulation time not in a linear manner, but in an exponential \nmanner. To understand this point, let\u2019s consider the following \nexample. If there are 10 points to search in a one-dimensional \nproblem, then there are 100 points to search in the \ncorresponding two-dimensional problem. Hence, the \ncomputational time reduces exponentially with respect to the \ndimensional of the problem. As a result, the computational \ncomplexity of the improved dual parameterization reduces \nmuch compared to that of the conventional dual \nparameterization method. It is found that the simulation time \nfor the improved dual parameterization method is about 5 \nminutes, while that of the conventional dual parameterization \nmethod using the same initial condition and parameters \u03b5 , N  \nand \n0\u0394  is about 17 days. All these experiments are running \nusing a PC with Pentium 1.2GHz CPU and 256M bytes \nDDRAM. Hence, the design time for the improved dual \nparameterization is greatly reduced by 99.9796%, even though \nthe dimensional of the problem is just reduced by 74.0031%. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe main contribution of this paper is to propose a fast \nimplementation algorithm for solving semi-infinite \nprogramming problems and applied to the optimum \nnonuniform symmetric\/anti-symmetric linear phase FIR filter \nbank design problems subject to various practical \nspecifications in the frequency domain. In the improved dual \nparameterization method, no more than 2+S  index points are \nchosen in each iteration of the standard quadratic program to \nform the parameterized dual problem, where S  is the \ndimension of the primal problem. As a result, it is only \nrequired to solve a standard quadratic program of dimension \nnot exceeding ( )2++ SmS  with S  linear equality constraints, \nwhere m  is the number of inequality constraints of the primal \nproblem. Furthermore, at the final local search procedure, we \nonly need to find a local solution of a nonlinear programming \nproblem of dimension no more than ( )( )21 +++ SmS . Hence, \nthe improved technique can significantly reduce the \ncomputational complexity. The numerical experiments \nobtained shows a significant improvement in terms of the \npassband and stopband specifications, as well as the amplitude \nand aliasing distortions, compared to other methods reported \nin existing literature. \nAPPENDIX I \nProof of Theorem I. \nAccording to Lemma 6, we can see that ix  is the solution \nof the problem ( )iZP . According to Lemma 5, we see that \nStep 5 is numerically feasible. Hence, according to Step 5, ix  \nis the solution of problem ( )iEP . On the other hand, 1+ix  is the \nsolution of problem ( )1+iZP  of which the constraint index set \n1+iZ  contains iE  as a subset. Thus, it is easy to see that \n)()( 1+\u2264 ii JJ xx , for L,2,1=i . (4) \nThe existence of a Slater point \n0x  for problem P shows that \nthe sequence { })( iJ x  is bounded from above by )( 0xJ . Thus, \nthere exists some constant \u2217J  such that \n\u2217\u2192 JJ i )(x , as +\u221e\u2192i . (5) \nThe strict convexity of the quadratic cost )(xJ  and the \nboundedness of { })( iJ x  guarantee that the sequence { }ix  is \nbounded. Let { }\nki\nx  be any chosen convergent subsequence of \n{ }ix  such that \nxx \u2192\nki\n, as +\u221e\u2192k , (6) \nfor some S\u211c\u2208x . We now show that x  is a feasible point of \nproblem P. In fact, if x  is not a feasible point of problem P, \nT-SP-03324-2005.R2 \n \n \n8\n8\nthen there exists \u0394\u22080\u03c9  such that ( ) 0, 0max >\u03c9g x . Let \n( ) \u03b4=0max ,2\n1\n\u03c9g x . (7) \nSince ( )\u03c9g ,max x  is continuous, we see that there exists 0>\u03b2  \nsuch that \n( ) ( ) \u03b4<\u2212 0maxmax ,, \u03c9g\u03c9g xx , for \u03b2<\u2212 xx  and \u03b2<\u2212 0\u03c9\u03c9 . (8) \nAs a result, we have \n( ) \u03b4\u2265\u03c9g ,max x , for \u03b2<\u2212 xx  and \u03b2<\u2212 0\u03c9\u03c9 . (9) \nFrom (2) and (6), there exists an integer K  such that for \nKk \u2265 , \nki\n\u0394  and kix  satisfy \n2\nminmax \u03b2\u03d6\u03d6 <\u2212\u0394\u2208\u0394\u2208 \u03c9ki\u03c9\n and \n2\n\u03b2<\u2212 xx ki . (10) \nEspecially, there exists \nkk ii\n\u03c9 \u0394\u2208  such that \nki\n\u03c9  and kix  satisfy \n20\n\u03b2<\u2212\u03c9\u03c9\nki\n and \n2\n\u03b2<\u2212 xx ki  for Kk \u2265 . (11) \nThus, ( ) \u03b4\u2265\nk\nk\ni\ni \u03c9g ,max x , for Kk \u2265 . (12) \nIt is clear from (12) and the definition of \n1+kiZ  that ki\u03c9  is in \n1+kiZ  and hence ( ) 0,1max \u2264+ kk ii \u03c9g x , for Kk \u2265 . (13) \nAgain, from the definitions of \n1+kiZ  and kiE , we see that \nkix  \nand 1+kix  are, respectively, the solution and a feasible point of \nproblem ( )\nki\nEP . Hence, from the fact that the feasible set of \nproblem ( )\nki\nEP  is convex and its objective function is strictly \nconvex, )(xJ  is strictly monotone along the segment \nconnecting kix  and 1+kix . Particularly, we have: \n)(\n2\n)( 1\n1\n+\n+\n<\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +< kkkk i\nii\ni JJJ xxxx . (14) \nSince { }\nki\n\u03c9  is contained in the compact set \u0394 , it has a \nconverging subsequence. Without loss of generality, we \nsuppose { }\nki\n\u03c9  itself converge to \u0394\u2208\u2032\u03c9 . At the same time, we \ncan further suppose that { }1+kix  converges to some limit x\u02c6 . \nTaking limit ( +\u221e\u2192k ) in (13) and (14), we obtain \n( ) 0,\u02c6max \u2264\u2032\u03c9g x  (15) \nand \n)\u02c6(\n2\n\u02c6\n)( xxxx JJJ \u2264\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\u2264 . (16) \nFrom (15), it allows that \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) \u03b42,\u02c6,,,\u02c6 max0max0maxmax \u2265\u2032\u2212\u2265\u2212\u2032 \u03c9g\u03c9g\u03c9g\u03c9g xxxx . (17) \nAccording to (11), we have \n2\n\u03b2\u2264\u2212\u2032 \u03c9\u03c9 . Hence, (8) shows \nthat \n\u03b2\u2265\u2212 xx\u02c6 . (18) \nFrom (5), we have \n)\u02c6()( xx JJ = . (19) \nNow we see that (16), (18), and (19) contradict the fact that \n)(xJ  is strictly convex. Therefore, x  is feasible to problem P. \nNext we show that the whole sequence { }ix  converges to \nthe solution \u2217x  of problem P. Suppose { }ix  does not \nconverge. Then there are two sequences { }kix  and { }kjx  \nconverging to x\u2032  and x \u2032\u2032 , respectively, where xx \u2032\u2032\u2260\u2032 . From \nthe above, we can see that both x\u2032  and x \u2032\u2032  are feasible to \nproblem P. Then point \n2\nxx \u2032\u2032+\u2032  is feasible to problem P and \nhence feasible to problem ( )\nki\nZP  for all 1\u2265k . Therefore, \n( ) ( ) \u2217=\u2032\u2032+\u2032<\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2032\u2032+\u2032 JJJJ\n22\nxxxx . (20) \nSince \u2217\u2192 JJ ki )(x  as +\u221e\u2192k , we have \n( )kiJJ xxx <\u239f\u23a0\u239e\u239c\u239d\u239b \u2032\u2032+\u2032 2 , (21) \nfor sufficiently large k . This contradicts to the fact that kix  is \nthe solution to problem ( )\nki\nZP . Therefore, { }ix  converges to \n\u2217x . It is clear that \u2217x  is the solution of problem P. \nFinally, if \u03b5  is sufficiently small and if N  is sufficiently \nlarge, then the approximation solution ix  found at the \ntermination of the iteration in Step 5 will be so close to the \nprimal solution that the objective value of problem kPDP  at ( )iii \u03c4\u03bcx ,,  is smaller than the second smallest local minimum \nvalue of problem kPDP . Therefore, the final local search \nprocedure will find the global solution. And this completes the \nproof. \u0084 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a \nresearch grant (project number G-YD26) from The Hong \nKong Polytechnic University, the Centre for Multimedia \nSignal Processing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, \nthe CRGC grant (project number PolyU 5105\\01E) from the \nResearch Grants Council of Hong Kong, as well as a research \ngrant from the Australian Research Council. \nREFERENCES \n[1] John D.
