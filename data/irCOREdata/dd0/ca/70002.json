Bush assumed the US presidency to President Bush\u2019s\nhandling of his so-called \u2018\u2018war on terror. \u2019\u2019 With its tagline \u2018\u2018The temperature\nwhere freedom burns, \u2019\u2019 Moore stresses the dubious ethical nature of the\nBush administration\u2019s post-9\/11 policies, especially as they redefine the US\nrelationship between freedom and censorship. In so doing, he challenges the\nBush administration\u2019s constructions of US morality as ultimately elitist and\nself-serving, substituting his own populist, class-based moral America(n) in\nits place.\nFor all their disagreements, George W. Bush and Michael Moore agree on\ntwo fundamental issues. The first is that even in the increasingly morally\nuncertain post-9\/11 era, one can hold on to a morally certain vision of\nAmerica and Americans (hemispheric terms that euphemistically and some\nwould argue imperially stand in for the citizens and state of the USA in both\nBush\u2019s and Moore\u2019s constructions of some collective US subject, what\nI prefer to call a US \u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019 ; see Weber 2006). Of course, their moral visions\nof a US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019 clash, but they are morally certain visions nonetheless. The\nsecond thing Bush and Moore agree on is that the figure who is most likely to\nbuttress their competing claims for moral authority to define who\nAmerica(ns) is\/are is the feminine. There is nothing particularly shocking\nabout this, for claims to moral certainty are almost inevitably claims made\nfrom a masculine subject position (even, of course, when they are made\nby women), and masculine subjects almost inevitably make these claims by\ninvoking a feminine figure as (their) moral support. What is shocking,\nhowever, is that the feminine functions in both Bush\u2019s war on terror and\nMichael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9\/11 in precisely the same way \u2013 as an apparently\nactivated figure whose utter enclosure within traditional US discourses of\nCynthia Weber is Professor of International Relations at Lancaster University, Lancaster\nLA1 4YD.\nJournal of American Studies, 40 (2006), 1, 113\u2013131 f 2006 Cambridge University Press\ndoi:10.1017\/S0021875806000776 Printed in the United Kingdom\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nhome\/nation\/state make it the most censored figure of all.1 In the Bush\nadministration\u2019s war on terror, this was most evident in Bush\u2019s use of burka-\nclad Afghan women as the basis of his second-wave justifications of the\nbombing of Afghanistan (Rosenberg 2002; Weber 2005).2 In Michael\nMoore\u2019s war on Bush, it is most evident in Moore\u2019s use of Fahrenheit 9\/11\u2019s\ncentral character Lila Lipscomb.\nWhat follows is a critical reading of Fahrenheit 9\/11, particularly its use of\nthe feminine as the foundation not only of claims to a moral America(n)\nbut to the moral authority of Michael Moore as the moral American par\nexcellence. Using Ray Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451 as its analytical point of\ndeparture, this essay explores how Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9\/11 engages themes of\ncensorship, political and pictorial trustworthiness, and crime and criminality\nto critique the Bush administration. What makes Moore\u2019s film both fasci-\nnating and troubling, it argues, is that each of these themes can be critically\nturned back onto Moore and his film, making us wonder about the moralities\nof Moore\u2019s personal brand of political resistance. The conclusion assesses\nthe dangers of Moore\u2019s strategy of domesticating the feminine as the moral\nfoundation of his discourse of resistance, pondering the implications of this\nmove for what is a central motif of Moore\u2019s work : the relationship between\njustice and security.\nFAHRENHEIT 9\/11\nFahrenheit 9\/11 begins with a black screen, against which fireworks appear.\nThe camera pans down to a campaign platform on election night, where Al\nGore and Joseph Lieberman celebrate their victory in the 2000 presidential\nelection. As this scene rolls, we hear Michael Moore in voiceover ask, \u2018\u2018Was\nit all just a dream? Did the last four years not happen? Was it a dream, or was\nit real? \u2019\u2019\n1 For a reading of how gender and sexuality function in US narratives of home\/nation\/state,\nwith particular emphasis on the function of the feminine, see Berlant 1997.\n2 UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, standing \u2018\u2018 shoulder to shoulder \u2019\u2019 with George Bush in his\nwar on terror, employed the same maneuvre regarding the relationship of women of\nAfghanistan to second-wave justifications for the war on terror as did President Bush, even\nto the extent of following Bush\u2019s lead in having his wife Cheri Blair speak publicly on the\nneed to liberate Afghan women, just as Laura Bush did in the US. Clearly, then, many of\nthe arguments directed at Bush\u2019s discourse could also be directed at Blair\u2019s discourse.\nHowever, because Blair is not the target of Michael Moore\u2019s film (appearing only once\nliterally as a member of Bush\u2019s posse) and because this essay concerns itself with Moore\u2019s\nstrategies (rather than Bush\u2019s, and much less Blair\u2019s), Blair receives as scant attention in this\nessay as he does in Moore\u2019s film.\n114 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nThis is Moore\u2019s introduction to his history of US politics over the past\nfour years. It begins with the events that lead first to \u2018\u2018 something called Fox\nNews\u2019\u2019 and finally to the US Supreme Court putting George W. Bush in the\nWhite House. It traces the Bush presidency prior to 9\/11 during which time\nthe new president spent 42 percent of his time on vacation and declared in\nfront of cameras in August of 2001 that he did not spend much time thinking\nabout Osama bin Laden. It recaps the horrors of 9\/11 itself by virtually\nrepeating how they are displayed in Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu\u2019s short film,\none of those that comprises the compilation 11 \u2019\u201909 \u2019\u201901. We hear the collapse\nof the twin towers but see only a blank screen. After this long moment,\nMoore cuts to the shock and horror of ordinary people in the streets caught\nup in this tragedy.\nThe film then recounts the Bush administration\u2019s reaction to 9\/11 \u2013 its\nwar in Afghanistan, its policies for Homeland Security, its passage of the\nPatriot Act, and finally its war in Iraq against Saddam Hussein. Along the\nway, Moore suggests that the Bush family\u2019s ties to the Saudi royal family \u2013\nparticularly their shared oil interests \u2013 largely account for the Bush\nadministration\u2019s actions and inactions in its war on terror. The US did not\ninvade Iraq, Moore suggests, for the reasons the administration says it did\n(primarily that it was a security threat to the US because of its weapons of\nmass destruction and Saddam\u2019s links to al-Qaeda, neither of which has been\nproven). It invaded Iraq for its own personal, elitist reasons (to secure the\ninterests of US companies linked to the President Bush and Vice President\nCheney\u2019s families, like the Carlyle Group, Unocal, and Halliburton, and to\navenge Saddam\u2019s attempt \u2018\u2018 to kill my Dad, \u2019\u2019 as George Jr. puts it in the film).\nMost people would agree on this summary. Judging from commentator\u2019s\nreviews, however, what they would vehemently disagree on is how they\nwould describe Moore\u2019s telling of this story. How should the film be\ncharacterized? Is Fahrenheit 9\/11 a documentary, or \u2018\u2018by mixing sober outrage\nwith mischievous humor, \u2019\u2019 does it \u2018\u2018blithely [trample] the boundary between\ndocumentary and demagoguery \u2019\u2019 (Scott 2004)? If \u2018\u2018Michael Moore doesn\u2019t so\nmuch make documentaries as make movies with documents \u2019\u2019 (O\u2019Brian\n2004), then might his film be better described by comparing it to something\nelse altogether \u2013 \u2018\u2018muckraking social satire \u2019\u2019 (Hoberman 2004), \u2018\u2018 an op-ed\npiece \u2019\u2019 (Ebert 2004), \u2018\u2018 an editorial cartoon\u2019\u2019 (Scott 2004), or \u2018\u2018 a beer\ncommercial \u2019\u2019 (Gitlin 2004)? Does Moore\u2019s \u2018\u2018high-spirited and unruly exercise\nin democratic self-expression \u2019\u2019 (Scott 2004) reduce the broader political value\nof his work, or does the genre he seems to have created of \u2018\u2018first-person\npolemic or expressionist bulletin board, or theatrical Op-Ed piece \u2019\u2019 become\nmore politically effective?\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 115\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nDiffering answers to these questions have led to differing opinions about\nthe film as a whole. Some reviewers hated the film. Of these, Christopher\nHitchens is the most scathing. He writes,\nTo describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those\nterms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be\nto run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To\ndescribe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit\n9\/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in\nseriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a\ndemonstration of \u2018\u2018dissenting \u2019\u2019 bravery. (Hitchens 2004)\nFar more reviewers offered (sometimes qualified) praise for the film,\ndescribing it as a \u2018\u2018brilliant battering ram\u2019\u2019 (Travers 2004) or as \u2018\u2018 incendiary,\nexcitable, often mawkishly emotional but simply gripping : a cheerfully par-\ntisan assault on the Bush administration\u2019 \u2019\u2019 and an \u2018\u2018 inflammatory polemic \u2019\u2019\n(Bradshaw 2004). And others still were of two minds about the film.\nDescribing Fahrenheit 9\/11 as \u2018\u2018 the liberals\u2019 \u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Passion of the Christ \u2019\u2019 (the\n2004 Mel Gibson film that was the darling of some of the religious right),\nDavid Edelstein confessed of the film, \u2018\u2018 It delighted me; it disgusted me.\nI celebrated it ; I lamented it. I\u2019m sure of only one thing : that I don\u2019t trust\nanyone \u2013 pro or con \u2013 who doesn\u2019t feel a twinge of doubt about his or her\nresponse, \u2019\u2019 (Edelstein 2004).\nI would describe Fahrenheit 9\/11 as a minority report on contemporary US\npolitics, shot through the genre of vigilante journalism (i.e. a watchful\nreporting style that claims to exercise a superior brand of (real) justice thanks\nto the personal involvement of its witness(es)). As such, it considers burning\npost-9\/11 moral debates \u2013 about (state) censorship, political trust (particu-\nlarly questions of the trustworthiness of political and pictorial images), and\nthe relationship between (state) crime and (political) consciousness \u2013 to tell a\ntale about post-9\/11 American morality.3 How the film ultimately establishes\nthe character of moral America(ns) is by apparently reactivating the role\nof the feminine. Overall, what makes Fahrenheit 9\/11 such an incendiary\nexperience is that it is imbricated in every one of the themes it critiques.\n3 As I have argued elsewhere, September 11 is a liminal moment in US history \u2013 not so much\nas a trauma that requires a national therapeutic response but rather as a \u2018\u2018confrontation \u2019\u2019\n(Lowenstein 2001) or an \u2018\u2018encounter \u2019\u2019 (McAlister 2001) with questions that haunt US\nrelationships both between self and other and with(in) the self (Weber 1999). As such,\npost-9\/11 US discourses have the capacity to place \u2018\u2018America \u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Americans \u2019\u2019 at the\nthreshold of a \u2018\u2018moral remaking \u2019\u2019 (Roseneil 2001), culminating in the question, \u2018\u2018who might\nwe become?\u2019\u2019 (see Bentley and Hargreaves 2001 ; and Weber 2006). That Michael\nMoore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9\/11 engages the moral implications of post-9\/11 policies as well as\nperformances of (the) US character(s) is therefore not at all surprising.\n116 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nThat the film is about censorship is immediately evident from its title.\nCombining the word \u2018\u2018Fahrenheit \u2019\u2019 with a number is a reference to Ray\nBradbury\u2019s famous novel Fahrenheit 451, published in 1953 (the height of the\nMcCarthy era). Setting his story some time in the future, Bradbury tells of a\nstate where reading the written word is banned. What people read instead are\nimages, static as well as moving pictures. Newspapers, for example, look like\ncompilations of comic strips, broadsheets of wordless picture panel followed\nby wordless picture panel. And television has so intruded into everyday life\nthat each home has several wall-sized screens. Firemen in Bradbury\u2019s future\nsociety do not put out fires ; they start them, for it is these state workers who\nare responsible for seizing and burning any surviving books. The story\u2019s title,\nFahrenheit 451, refers to the temperature at which paper burns.\nAs depressing as all this sounds, it is important to note that Bradbury\u2019s tale\nof state censorship and the suppression of individual rights is also a tale of\npolitical resistance. In order to circumvent state authoritarianism based upon\na dangerous anti-intellectualism, a growing number of common citizens have\ntaken it upon themselves to memorize great books and then to pass their\nknowledge on to future generations. Fahrenheit 451, then, is a story about how,\nwhen everyday individuals band together to remember the past, they\nconstitute both a political threat to the present authoritarian state and our\nbest hope for a future in which we will all enjoy individual freedoms.\nWith its tagline \u2018\u2018The temperature where freedom burns ! \u2019\u2019, Fahrenheit 9\/11\nboldly proclaims that the future is now. What Moore\u2019s title infers is that\nBradbury\u2019s nightmare of state censorship arrived in the US on 9\/11, and\nAmerica\u2019s best hope for a better future is to remember its past \u2013 not the\nMcCarthy era but the more immediate past of the Bush presidency \u2013 so that\nAmericans will not repeat it. By releasing his film in the run-up to the 2004\nUS presidential elections, Moore made no secret of the fact that Fahrenheit\n9\/11 was part of his personal campaign to make sure George W. Bush was\nremoved from the White House (Younge 2004).\nIn the run-up to the summer 2004 US release of Fahrenheit 9\/11 Moore\u2019s\npoints about censorship, made implicitly through his film\u2019s title and explicitly\nthrough his film\u2019s discussion of things like the Bush administration\u2019s\nimplementation of the Patriot Act, became issues surrounding the screening\nof his film as well. When the Disney Corporation, whose subsidiary Miramax\nhad purchased the film, refused to distribute Fahrenheit 9\/11, the film was\nbought back by Miramax co-founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein and\nmarketed under an additional tagline, \u2018\u2018The film they did not want you to\nsee. \u2019\u2019 Then groups like Move America Forward tried to pressure individual\nUS theatres into not showing the film (O\u2019Brian 2004 ; Younge 2004).\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 117\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nSome have claimed that this censorship storm was of Moore\u2019s own mak-\ning, helping him win the coveted Palme d\u2019Or for Best Picture at the Cannes\nFilm Festival (Anthony 2004 ; Kermode 2004) and thereby hyping Fahrenheit\n9\/11. It is difficult to assess the truth of such a claim. What is not difficult to\nassess, though, is that Fahrenheit 9\/11 became a must-see film in the US and\nbeyond. The film grossed $21.8 million in the US in its first three days and\nhad earned $100 million in the US alone by August 2004, making it the\nhighest-grossing \u2018\u2018documentary \u2019\u2019 of all time (Yahoo Movies Box Office\nCharts 2004).\nNot surprisingly for an overtly political (and politically divisive) film\nlike Fahrenheit 9\/11, the film\u2019s success led to more cries against it, taking the\nform of a documentary called Michael Moore Hates America, a book called\nMichael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man (a play on Moore\u2019s book Stupid\nWhite Men), and even accusations by the conservative group Citizens\nUnited that Moore violated federal election laws because he has admitted\nthat his goal was to affect the November 2004 presidential elections\n(Younge 2004). All this is to say that censorship is something that Bradbury\u2019s\nnovel and Moore\u2019s film have in common. Having said this, though,\nthere are clear differences between Bradbury\u2019s original story and Moore\u2019s\nriff on it.\nIn Bradbury\u2019s story the past to be remembered is not of state censorship\nbut of the great intellectual traditions represented by great literary works that\npreceded it. Fahrenheit 451, then, is as much a critique of the dystopia of the\nMcCarthy era as it is a celebration of the intellectual utopia that preceeded\nit. In contrast, Moore never makes the claim that the more distant past (say,\nthe Clinton presidency, for example) was better than the present ; he\nmerely emphasizes just how bad the near past under Bush has been and\nhow tragic it would be to repeat this near past in the near future. As\nsuch, there does not appear to be a utopian vision in Moore\u2019s film, just a\nwarning about our current and possibly future dystopia (a point I will return\nto later).\nBut undoubtedly the biggest difference between Bradbury\u2019s novel and\nMoore\u2019s suggested equivalence to it concerns the very different ways each\nregards the written word in comparison to the visual image. By highlighting\nthe trivializing of information through the image while celebrating the\nretention of information through the memorialization of the written word,\nBradbury\u2019s hierarchy of words over images could not be clearer. Rightly or\nwrongly, Bradbury argues that the simplicity of images and their easy\nmanipulation puts pictures on the side of anti-intellectualism, whereas the\ncomplexity of words, and their ability to cut through and complicate what we\n118 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nsee, is the epitome of intellectualism. For Bradbury, then, images are far less\ntrustworthy than words.4\nWriting in the early 1950s \u2013 a time when images were rapidly invading\nAmerican homes through television \u2013 novelist Bradbury\u2019s celebration of the\nrevolutionary potential of the written word is not difficult to understand.\nHalf a century later, it is equally understandable why filmmaker Moore would\nreverse this hierarchy. For, now, do we not live in a visual age in which \u2018\u2018 life\ntakes place on screen\u2019\u2019 (Mirzoeff 1999)? And if that is the case, does it not\nmake sense that political arguments are most effective when made visual?\nThis is the implicit case made by Moore\u2019s film. Fahrenheit 9\/11 is much\nmore than the splicing together of Moore\u2019s best-selling books Stupid White\nMen (2002) and Dude, Where\u2019s My Country? (2003), even though much of the\ninformation in each book is found in Moore\u2019s film. Rather, it is a visual (and\naural) tour de force that powerfully appeals to the mediatic American\nmindset. As such, Fahrenheit 9\/11 is arguably less interesting for what it says\nthan for how it says it.\nHow the film tells its story is through the presentation of \u2018\u2018pictures that\nseem to speak for themselves \u2019\u2019 (O\u2019Brian 2004). These images come in the\nform of censored media clips of \u2018\u2018what they didn\u2019t want us (the US public) to\nsee, \u2019\u2019 popular images that the US public has seen before and therefore\ninstantly understands, and underreported first-person accounts of what the\nUS public actually saw for themselves. The censored clips come in three\nvarieties : pre-rolls, post-rolls, and non-rolls. Pre-rolls are bits of footage\ntaken while the camera is rolling but before the footage is fed live on tele-\nvision, post-rolls are bits of footage taken after the live feed while the camera\nis still rolling, and non-rolls are footage that was not broadcast.\nIn the style of Kevin Rafferty and James Ridgway\u2019s 1992 documentary Feed\nabout the New Hampshire primaries, Fahrenheit 9\/11 runs embarrassing\npre-rolls of a collection of Bush administration officials \u2013 from Condoleezza\nRice to Paul Wolfowitz to the president himself \u2013 as they preen themselves\nfor the camera (Bradshaw 2004). In these takes we see Wolfowitz soak his\ncomb in his own saliva and then run it through his pompadour. That\u2019s\n4 While Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451 offers an insightful critique of the dangers of assuming\nimages speak for themselves, it of course neglects to fold this critique back onto Bradbury\u2019s\nprivileging of words as pure sources of potential resistance. With this in mind, I raise\nBradbury\u2019s critique of images not because I buy into his \u2018\u2018words over images \u2019\u2019 hierarchy\nbut for two different reasons. The first is that Bradbury\u2019s critique of the how images might\nwork to anti-intellectual effect is a powerful one. The second is that in raising Bradbury as\nhis inspirational source about censorship, Moore forgets (censors?) this fundamental point\nraised by Bradbury, a point I will critically turn back onto Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9\/11.\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 119\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ndisgusting, and funny. But what is more disturbing is President Bush prac-\nticing facial expressions immediately before he goes live to tell the US public\nthat the US is at war with Iraq. While humorous, these pre-rolls are not\nnecessarily politically effective. For do we not all fix ourselves up and\nrehearse before we go on camera? And, if that is the case, then does that not\nmean the critical story these pre-rolls tell can be told about anyone? Indeed,\nthose familiar with Rafferty and Ridgway\u2019s film know that shots of this very\nsame type were used to question the character of then-Governor Bill\nClinton, a knowledge which neutralizes the political effectiveness of using\nimages of this type against Bush administration officials.\nIt is Moore\u2019s use of post-rolls that is more effective. Two post-rolls in\nparticular stand out. There is the footage of President Bush on a golf course,\ngolf club in hand, talking tough about terrorism to a group of journalists.\nThen, without missing a beat, the President turns to the real business of\nthe day and tells the journalists, \u2018\u2018Now watch this drive. \u2019\u2019 But the\nmost damning post-roll in the film was also probably the most important\npost-9\/11 non-roll. Taken on 9\/11, it shows the president sitting in that\ninfamous Florida elementary school classroom. Fahrenheit 9\/11 shows us what\nwe have all seen before \u2013 an official whispering into the President\u2019s ear, \u2018\u2018The\nnation is under attack, \u2019\u2019 after a second plane hit the Twin Towers. And then\nit shows us what the president did in response. He sat there for a full seven\nminutes. Because no one told him what to do, Moore suggests, the president\ncontinued to read My Pet Goat with the children. What is shocking about this\npost-roll is not only the images it presents but the fact that these images had\nnever before been shown to a mass US audience. What is also shocking\nabout these images is that they seem to speak for themselves. But they do not.\nNever mind that Moore makes these seven minutes real for viewers by\ntaking nearly seven minutes to present them, thereby allowing viewers to feel\nthis time as well as to see it. These seven minutes are intercut with Moore\u2019s\naccount of how prior to 9\/11 the Bush administration ignored warnings of\nan imminent terrorist attack and cut funding to fight terrorism. Jumping back\nand forth between the seemingly bewildered Bush and this backstory, Moore\nspeculates in voiceover what Bush must have thought during those seven\nminutes : Who screwed me? Was it Saddam, the Taliban, the Saudis?\nUndoubtedly this seven minute post-roll\/non-roll speaks volumes. But, like\nany image, precisely what these seven minutes say, what they mean, is not\nself-evident. Those on the right might interpret these images as showing the\npresident setting an example of calm for the American people. Had the\npresident acted differently, \u2018\u2018 leaped from his stool, adopted a Russell Crowe\nstance, and gone to work, \u2019\u2019 he might well have been criticized by some on\n120 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nthe left for either \u2018\u2018being a man who went to war on a hectic, crazed\nimpulse \u2019\u2019 or as someone who expected the attack and used it to solidify his\npower, who \u2018\u2018couldn\u2019t wait to get on with his coup\u2019\u2019 (Hitchens 2004).\nI am not trying to make a case for reading these seven minutes one way or\nanother. Rather I am trying to make the same point that Bradbury made in\nFahrenheit 451 \u2013 that we cannot trust the image alone, a point Moore makes\nhimself (albeit very differently) in Fahrenheit 9\/11. For if Moore trusted images\nalone then he would not have needed to set his pictures to provocative\nsoundtracks. REM\u2019s \u2018\u2018Shiny Happy People \u2019\u2019 accompanies scenes of the\nBushes and the Saudis socializing. The theme song from the TV show The\nGreatest American Hero (\u2018\u2018Suddenly I\u2019m up on the top of the world\/Shoulda\nbeen somebody else \u2019\u2019) plays as Bush addresses naval personnel and prema-\nturely announces \u2018\u2018mission accomplished\u2019\u2019 in Iraq. And the music from a\nMarlboro cigarette ad plays as Moore wonders aloud why, in spite of a\nterrorist\u2019s attempt to light a shoe bomb on an airplane, up to four books of\nmatches and two lighters can be carried by each passenger on US flights.\nIf Moore trusted images alone, then he would not have had to calculat-\ningly mix his images and sounds. He would not need to use clips from old US\ntelevision shows like Bonanza to mock the collection of characters in Bush\u2019s\nposse or turn to Dragnet to underscore the administration\u2019s presumed failure\nto question the bin Laden family before they left the US (a \u2018\u2018 fact \u2019\u2019 that Moore\nreportedly got wrong; see Kermode 2004). Nor would Moore need to\nsample old Western and witch-hunt films and splice them with the sound\nbites of George Jr.\nOverall, if Moore trusted images alone, then he would not have needed to\nmanipulate never-before-seen footage by intercutting it with popular cultural\nsounds and images that solicit immediate, anticipated thoughts and feelings\nfrom his American viewing public. He would not have needed to exclude\nimages and arguments that undercut his case against Bush.5 And he would\n5 Many critics have pointed to Moore\u2019s own censorship of images and arguments. Consider,\nfor example, Geoffrey O\u2019Brian\u2019s comments,\nThis is a film about the September 11 attacks and the war on terror that omits any discussion of al-\nQaeda and Islamist radicalism, while dramatically fudging its account of the Afghanistan war, and a\nfilm on the Iraq war that avoids any discussion of the nature of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime_ Iraqi life\nunder Saddam Hussein is represented, in a sequence that seems almost a parody of the generic\npropaganda film, by a montage of happy wedding parties, bustling restaurants, a little boy flying a kite,\na little girl going down a slide : all of it brutally interrupted by the American bombs. Moore seems\nreluctant to allow opposition to express any coherent argument, even if only to knock it down, just as\nin Bowling for Columbine the arguments for gun ownership rights were entrusted to an unprepared and\nvisibly frail Charlton Heston and to the wild-eyed brother of Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nicols.\n(O\u2019Brian 2004)\nOr James Berardinelli\u2019s comments about Moore\u2019s use of Lila Lipscomb,\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 121\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nnot have needed to set the whole thing to his own voiceover. But Moore\ndoes all of these things, and some. He does them because he, like Bradbury,\nknows that images do not speak for themselves. That is why he has to speak\nfor them, all the while presenting himself as if he is speaking through them.6\nAnd yet things are more complicated than this. For there are some images\nthat Moore seems to suggest are beyond manipulation. These images are what\nthe US public saw for themselves, first-person accounts of actual events. In\n2000 the US public saw for themselves that Gore and Lieberman won the US\npresidential election. Moore tells us it was only thanks to Bush\u2019s cousin John\nEllis (a Fox News executive who called Florida for Bush) and a conservative\nSupreme Court (some of whose members were appointed by the Reagan and\nBush administrations) that George W. Bush ended up in the White House.\nBy 2004 the US public can see for themselves the devastation caused by\nnearly four years of the Bush presidency. It takes the form of failed\nMaybe Moore had the good fortune to interview this particular woman while her son was still alive, so\nhe could capture her radical shift of allegiance afterwards. But his past argues that he might not be\nplaying things straight. Moore has a longstanding history of manipulating the truth, and we have no\nway of assessing whether any doctoring has been done with the Lipscomb interviews. With another\nfilmmaker, such as Errol Morris [The Fog of War], we wouldn\u2019t question what\u2019s on screen. But Moore\u2019s\nreputation demands that we regard everything in his films with a healthy portion of skepticism.\n(Berardinelli 2004)\nAlso see Hitchens (2004) and Kermode (2004).\n6 One might argue that all of Moore\u2019s techniques are standard practice in filmmaking, even\nin the genre of documentary filmmaking. This is because film is always presented from a\nparticular point of view, and as such is a commentary constructed through processes of\nselection and explication reliant upon the editing of images, ideas, and sounds. In light of\nthis one might conclude that Moore\u2019s particular practices of editing images, ideas, and\nsounds to construct his strong authorial voice and his engaging film are worthy not of\ncritique but of praise. While there is much to praise in Moore\u2019s work (especially the political\nresults of that work), I would not go so far as to excuse some of his filmmaking techniques\non the basis that \u2018\u2018 all filmmakers \u2013 even documentary filmmakers \u2013 engage in these same\npractices. \u2019\u2019 To do so would be to overlook a rich debate among documentary filmmakers\nthemselves about what constitutes acceptable ethical practices in filmmaking, a debate that\nhas been raging about Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9\/11 since its release (see, for example, the\ndocumentary discussion list on the Shooting People website, www.shootingpeople.com, from\nJuly 2004), not to mention Moore\u2019s earlier films, especially Bowling for Columbine.\nFurthermore, as I have already suggested, Moore\u2019s genre of filmmaking is less pure\ndocumentary than it is what I call \u2018\u2018vigilante journalism, \u2019\u2019 a watchful reporting style that\nclaims to exercise a superior brand of (real) justice thanks to the personal involvement of\nits witness(es). In this filmic genre, I would argue, ethical standards of filmmaking ought to\nbe of the highest priority since this genre prides itself on its higher moral status vis-a`-vis\nalternative forms of filmmaking. As such, it should not concern itself only with outcomes\n(the political ends of its storytelling) but also very much with the ethics of its storytelling\nitself (the means). This, I will go on to argue, is precisely where Moore\u2019s filmmaking falls\nshort, especially when one analyzes the feminine (Lila Lipscomb) used as a means toward\nMoore\u2019s political ends.\n122 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nHomeland Security testified to by average, ordinary, under-resourced\nOregon state troopers and by average, ordinary over-surveyed US citizens\nsubjected to the restrictions of the Patriot Act. It is shown as failed US\nforeign policy testified to by amputee US veterans of Gulf War II and\nMoore\u2019s own gruesome footage of the death and devastation US foreign\npolicy brought to Iraq. But probably most forcefully it is expressed as the\nfailed hopes and dreams of everyday Americans to believe in the integrity of\ntheir leaders.\nIt is this final story \u2013 of not only lost hope but of betrayed expectations \u2013\nthat is the emotional and moral core of Moore\u2019s story. Unlike in Moore\u2019s\nprevious documentaries Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine, the figure who\ntells this story is not Michael Moore ; it is Lila Lipscomb, a white working-\nclass mother from Moore\u2019s hometown of Flint, Michigan.\nLipscomb first appears in a segment establishing how poor \u2013 and\nparticularly black \u2013 youths are targeted by US military recruiters to enlist and\nfight in US wars like Iraq. Lila Lipscomb, a former welfare mother in a\nmixed-race family who now works at an employment agency designed to get\npeople off welfare, tells Moore that the military is an excellent option for\npeople from economically depressed Flint. She boasts that two of her\nchildren served in the military, a daughter in Gulf War I and a son in Gulf\nWar II. To further establish Lipscomb\u2019s credentials as a true US patriot,\nMoore shows her hanging the American flag outside her home, which she\ndoes every day, and viewers notice she is wearing not only a cross around her\nneck but an American flag pinned to her lapel.\nMoore often cuts away from Lipscomb to interview US soldiers caught up\nin the Iraq conflict. He shows some soldiers behaving badly by disrespecting\nan Iraqi corpse or by getting themselves charged up for war in a very\nApocalypse Now way by playing music with the lyrics \u2018\u2018burn, motherfucker,\nburn. \u2019\u2019 But mostly he shows US soldiers who feel betrayed. One serving\nsoldier tells Moore that if he saw Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld he\nwould tell him to resign. Another soldier who did a tour of duty in Iraq tells\nMoore that he will refuse to return, no matter the consequences. And a\nnumber of veteran amputees discuss their disillusionment with the war and\nwith the aftercare that each of them so tragically embodies.\nBut Moore always returns to Lipscomb and her story. What we learn from\nLipscomb is that her son Michael Pedersen had reservations about going to\nIraq, but did so because it was his duty to go. But once over there, he wrote\nto his mother that the war was not justified, and that she should do every-\nthing in her power to make sure that George W. Bush was not reelected.\nA tearful Lipscomb sits on a sofa surrounded by her family as she reads this\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 123\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nletter, which she received a week after she got the news that her son\u2019s Black\nHawk helicopter was shot down and he was killed. In a move echoing\nMoore\u2019s attempt to confront General Motors chairman Roger Smith about\nthe 1980s closing of the Flint GM plant in Roger and Me, Lipscomb goes to\nWashington to confront President George W. Bush about his betrayal of her\nand her son. But, again echoing Moore\u2019s experience, she is refused entry into\nthe White House, only to be confronted by an angry pro-war woman in the\nadjacent Lafayette Square, who shouts at her, \u2018\u2018This is all a set-up, \u2019\u2019 to which\nLipscomb replies, \u2018\u2018My son is dead. That is not a set up. \u2019\u2019\nWhat Lipscomb represents is not just a mourning mother but the moral\ncenter of a betrayed America. This US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019 has been betrayed by the Bush\nadministration, Moore\u2019s film proclaims. Because of the trustworthy images\nMoore presents in his film, all Americans can see that they have been lied to\nby the Bush administration, which apparently is the only reason Americans\nsupported the suspension of some civil liberties by passing the Patriot Act\nand supported the Bush administration\u2019s war in Iraq. And because the US\n\u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019 can see the Bush administration for what it is, it can look ahead to\nthink about what this US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019 wants to be in the future. What Fahrenheit\n9\/11 tells it is that the US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019 does not have to relive this nightmarish\nprevision of four more years of the Bush administration. Instead, the US\npublic can vote George W. Bush out of the White House.\nThis is how Michael Moore articulates American morality in relation to\ncontemporary US politics, which are as much about Bush\u2019s war on terror as\nthey are about Moore\u2019s war on Bush. Becoming a moral America(n) for\nMoore involves recognizing that the morally enlightened US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019 was not\ndreaming, that the past four years did happen, and that even though America\nand Americans did horrible things during those years, these things were not\n\u2018\u2018our \u2019\u2019 fault. \u2018\u2018We\u2019\u2019 are basically good, but because \u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019 were lied to \u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019\ndidn\u2019t see what was really going on. Thanks to Moore turning the \u2018\u2018eyes of\nthe nation\u2019\u2019 back on the big \u2018\u2018 I \u2019\u2019 of George W. Bush and his administration,\n\u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019 know more than we did before because \u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019 have seen what we were\nnot allowed to see before. So the moment has arrived for \u2018\u2018us \u2019\u2019 to act morally.\nActing morally begins by acting at home \u2013 by voting George W. Bush out of\nthe White House. This is Michael Moore\u2019s prevision of a moral America.\nLike all morality tales, Moore\u2019s articulation of American morality is gen-\ndered. In particular, it makes sense only when expressed through a particular\nUS \u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019 that is located in relation to specific gendered, heterosexual familial\nrelations. The first thing to notice about Moore\u2019s US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019 is that it is\nboth hyper-individualized and utterly collectivized at the same time. Its\nindividualism lies in the populist spirit of Moore\u2019s work, expressed through\n124 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nhis insistent first-person perspective. As Gary O\u2019Brian argues of Moore\u2019s\nfilm,\nIts fiction is that one man \u2013 not a lecturer or a representative of a political party, but\nsomebody you might meet at a party or in a bar \u2013 is telling you according to his own\nlights what\u2019s been going on in the world lately_ [A]t every step, he reminds you in\ndevastating detail how ineptly or deceptively others have told their versions of this\nsame story. The proof of their ineptitude or deception is that he\u2019s telling things you\nhaven\u2019t heard before, and showing you pictures that seem to speak for themselves.\nIt\u2019s not a story about a well-hidden conspiracy : all you have to do, he implies, is look\naround. You could set outside the room where you\u2019re sitting and pick up the trail\nanywhere, right on the street. (O\u2019Brian 2004)\nMoore\u2019s populist US \u2018\u2018we, \u2019\u2019 then, is about every one of \u2018\u2018us \u2019\u2019 ; it is about\nevery ordinary American, every US \u2018\u2018me. \u2019\u2019\nYet this \u2018\u2018we\/me\u2019\u2019 is utterly collective. For Moore\u2019s US \u2018\u2018me\u2019\u2019 is firmly\nembedded in a particular collective category, the relatively downtrodden\neconomic and social class that does not form part of George W. Bush\u2019s\n\u2018\u2018base. \u2019\u2019 And that transforms Moore\u2019s US \u2018\u2018me\u2019\u2019 into a US \u2018\u2018we. \u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018We\u2019\u2019 are\nthe many middle-class but mostly working-class Americans who have suf-\nfered at the hands of these elite few and their neoliberal economic politics\nthat benefit \u2018\u2018 them\u2019\u2019 but not \u2018\u2018us. \u2019\u2019 Moore emphasizes this point is his closing\nvoiceover to Fahrenheit 9\/11. Speaking of America\u2019s poor and their historical\nrelationship with US wars, Moore ponders aloud, \u2018\u2018 It is hard to understand\nhow the worst off are the first to step up so we can be free. All they ask in\nreturn is that we don\u2019t send them into harm\u2019s way unless it is absolutely\nnecessary. Will they ever trust us again? \u2019\u2019\nIn this closing voiceover, Moore positions himself as if he is not a part of\nthis US \u2018\u2018we, \u2019\u2019 as if he is part of some \u2018\u2018 they \u2019\u2019 that has done the US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019\nharm by being untrustworthy. This is both ironic and strategic. It is ironic\nbecause the less-off \u2018\u2018we\/me\u2019\u2019 that is the moral center of Fahrenheit 9\/11 is the\nmoral center of every Michael Moore documentary. The only difference\nbetween past films Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine and this film is that\nin the earlier films it is Moore himself who embodies this US \u2018\u2018we\/me. \u2019\u2019 That\nin Fahrenheit 9\/11 this task falls to Lila Lipscomb makes strategic sense, for it\nallows Moore to claim to be speaking as a mournful \u2018\u2018 them\u2019\u2019 when he is really\nspeaking for an \u2018\u2018us \u2019\u2019 that reflects \u2018\u2018him. \u2019\u2019\nLipscomb\u2019s embodiment of the moral American \u2018\u2018we \u2019\u2019 is strategic in\nanother sense. For it enables Moore to consider the relationship between\ncrime and consciousness from a seemingly objective perspective. Fahrenheit\n9\/11 objects to the state\u2019s extended criminalization of consciousness and the\nunconsciousness, whether domestically (by increased surveillance of peace\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 125\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nactivists and other everyday Americans) or internationally (through the Bush\ndoctrine of preemption). In making these objections the film raises everyday\nAmericans\u2019 consciousness about the crimes committed against them and\nin their name by the Bush administration, thereby locating crime in state\npractices and embracing Moore\u2019s brand of consciousness-raising as political\nactivism.\nCrucially it is the feminine \u2013 an everyday, poor heterosexual American\nmother in a mixed-race family \u2013 who makes possible this plot twist against\nthe state. She is the link between her martyred soldier son and the all-too-\nunaware American public. There is no better figure to bring about \u2018\u2018our \u2019\u2019\nconsciousness-raising than Lila Lipscomb. This is because Lila Lipscomb\nknows that American soldiers are mainly moral, and we should respect and\ncelebrate them, even if the wars they fight are unpopular. But she also knows\nthat America\u2019s (presumably) moral vision can be eclipsed by unjust state\npractices. It is for this reason that testifying to what one has seen is a moral\nnecessity.\nLila Lipscomb, then, is someone who can offer her testimony to the\nfailures of state policy while keeping her patriotism intact. Unlike Michael\nMoore, who is accused of being against everything and nothing at the same\ntime, Lila Lipscomb is not against \u2018\u2018America. \u2019\u20197 She is not even against war.\nBut she is firmly against this war and against this president\u2019s reelection\nbecause he got \u2018\u2018us \u2019\u2019 into this war. Lila Lipscomb moves many American\nmovie-goers to tears when she speaks of her loss and her determination to\nchange US policy by changing the US president. Unlike Moore, when\nLipscomb is accused of a set-up or of scoffing at power, viewers generally\nfeel pained by this accusation. For this is not an indiscriminately con-\ntemptuous woman. She is a woman who represents America\u2019s loss as (if it\nwere) our own. For in ways that Michael Moore never could, Lila Lipscomb\n7 These criticisms of Moore come from the character of his critiques, in which Moore seems\nto want things all ways. In Fahrenheit 9\/11, for example, Moore objects both to the under-\nresourcing of US homeland security and to the overly vigilant implementation of the US\nPatriot Act. Because of such inconsistencies in Moore\u2019s argument, audiences always get the\nimpression that Moore is against something ; they just don\u2019t necessarily know what the\ncontent of this opposition is. I would argue that Moore\u2019s dilemma of seeming to be against\neverything and nothing actually stems from his unabashed alliance with the character he\nconstructs in each of his films as the moral core of his arguments \u2013 the relatively down-\ntrodden, usually working-class, often racialized moral American. By elevating the underdog\nto the position of the purveyor of absolute good, Moore anchors his narrative about moral\nAmerica(ns) in this under-appreciated character. But because there are \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018bad \u2019\u2019\npeople in whatever class, race, gender, sexuality, you name it, doing both \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 things all the time, Moore\u2019s moral anchor pulls him into the morally ambiguous\ndeep waters of practical problems time and again.\n126 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nrepresents the sacrifices of the American homefront, \u2018\u2018our \u2019\u2019 sacrifices. She is\nnot some traditional, stereotypically inactive homefront (Elshtain 1995; and\nMichel 1989). Rather, Lila Lipscomb is that unruly feminine (Irigaray 1985)\nwho, in her determination to (re)secure the US home(front), is willing to\ninsecure not only US state practices but also the US president himself. In\nFahrenheit 9\/11, then, Lila Lipscomb, not Michael Moore, is \u2018\u2018our \u2019\u2019 champion.\nFor Lila Lipscomb is who (American) movie-goers and Americans more\ngenerally trust.\nCONCLUSION\nFahrenheit 9\/11 would be just another Michael Moore film if it were not\nfor Lila Lipscomb. And this is something that Moore himself seems to\nappreciate. Lipscomb explained in an interview,\nMichael Moore said he\u2019d already been around America interviewing all different\ntypes of people [for the film]. It was the most incredible experience ; he was sitting in\nour living room and all of a sudden, during the talking and sharing, a tear fell from\nhis eye. His producer said afterwards, \u2018\u2018Michael found it, he found it, he found what\nthe movie was going to be about ! \u2019\u2019 (Brockes 2004)\nWhat a Michael Moore movie is always about is Moore\u2019s use of sounds\nand images to speak \u2018\u2018 truth \u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018power. \u2019\u2019 Truth is located in working-class\nor otherwise oppressed (usually racialized) Americans ; power in oppressive\n(usually white) American elites. As such, Moore\u2019s films are always domestic\ntales that redress the balance between justice and security. Roger and Me is\nabout the unjust closure of a GM plant that led to the economic insecurity of\nits workers. Bowling for Columbine is about the unjust promotion of America\u2019s\ngun culture by elites and industries that lead to the insecuring of all\nAmericans, especially children. And Fahrenheit 9\/11 is about the unjust lies of\nGeorge W. Bush and his administration that lead to insecuring not only\nAmerica\u2019s poor who fight Bush\u2019s wars but also to insecuring the very idea of\na moral America as the champion of democratic freedoms for all.\nMoore\u2019s picture of America that seems to speak for itself is based upon\ntwo ideals \u2013 the first utopian, the second dystopian. Moore\u2019s utopian ideal is\nthe populist belief in the goodness of everyday Americans. Moore\u2019s dysto-\npian ideal is that in bringing forth the goodness of everyday Americans, the\nmeans seem to justify the ends. Moore\u2019s means do not involve burning\nbooks, instead they involve burning images that seem to speak for them-\nselves but are spoken for by Moore into the eyes\/souls of movie-goers.\nCaught between Moore\u2019s utopian ideal and his dystopian tactics is Lila\nLipscomb. Lipscomb might be read not only as a good everyday American\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 127\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nwith a story Moore must bring to the US public (a story which, incidentally,\nMoore discovered after it was made public in the US magazine Newsweek\n(Brockes 2004)) but also as Moore\u2019s means toward achieving his own ends.\nFor this most domestic of domestic US figures \u2013 the grieving mother of a\nsoldierly son speaking her mind to a President of the United States who\nrefuses to listen \u2013 symbolizes the unruly homefront who, in attempting to\nsecure home\/nation, is in perfect opposition to the Bush administration\u2019s\nwar in Iraq. As such, Lipscomb challenges the past fictitious function of the\nfeminine as a docile US homefront\/woman who needs protecting and as the\nstage from which the projection of US patriarchal power into the world is\nmade possible (Weber 2002).\nLipscomb is well aware that she is voicing homefront opposition to Bush\u2019s\nwar in Iraq. What she may be less aware of is that, by doing so in a Michael\nMoore film, her very personal \u2018\u2018 I\/me\u2019\u2019 is translated into Michael Moore\u2019s\nspecific US \u2018\u2018we. \u2019\u2019 Yes, Lipscomb is working class. Yes, she is a mother in a\nmixed-race family. But that does not mean that she supports the many things\nthat Moore\u2019s US \u2018\u2018we\u2019\u2019 embodies. The only content to her opposition to\nBush\u2019s war in Iraq is her son\u2019s objections to that war and his untimely death.\nShe makes no argument about oil pipelines or Bush\u2013Saudi ties or stolen\nelections or the over-zealous Patriot Act coupled with the failures of\nHomeland Security. But by functioning as the moral center of Moore\u2019s\nfilm \u2013 as \u2018\u2018what the film is about \u2019\u2019 \u2013 Lipscomb is fused with all of this and\nmore\/Moore. Indeed, there are two things that theater-goers regularly recall\nafter seeing Fahrenheit 9\/11 : those seven minutes when Bush readMy Pet Goat\nand Lila Lipscomb. There is no connection between these two images except\nthe connection Moore makes between them.\nIn speaking against one patriarchal projection of power, Lipscomb seems\ncondemned to speak for\/as another. For within the frames of Moore\u2019s film,\nspeaking against Bush\u2019s project means speaking for Moore\u2019s project. And\nwhile the masculinities that inform them could not be more different (Bush\u2019s\nWild West cowboy vs. Michael Moore\u2019s working-class, racially sensitive,\nnew-age guy), how they authoritatively speak for the domestic (be it state or\nmother) suggests that they are both patriarchal, even while they embody\nstrikingly different political projects.\nWhen articulated outside the frames of Moore\u2019s film, Lipscomb\u2019s project\nsounds altogether different from Moore\u2019s. In an interview with Guardian\nnewspaper reporter Emma Brockes, what Lipscomb conveys is her loss of\ncertainty in the idea that \u2018\u2018 the government knew best \u2019\u2019 about Iraq. And that\nhas made her question all authority. As Brockes reports, \u2018\u2018Now, instead of\ntelling them to trust authority, Lipscomb is raising her seven grandchildren\n128 Cynthia Weber\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nto question it. \u2018\u2018 I tell them: if you don\u2019t understand something, ask. And if\nyou still don\u2019t understand it, go to the next level. And the next. And the\nnext \u2019\u2019 (Brockes 2004). Lipscomb, then, is asking Americans to think. Moore,\nin contrast, only seems to be asking Americans to see. And, because of the\nway images function in a Michael Moore film, \u2018\u2018 seeing \u2019\u2019 may not mean\n\u2018\u2018 thinking\u2019\u2019 at all, unless it is about letting a morally certain Moore think\nfor us.\nBy seeming to swap his \u2018\u2018 I \u2019\u2019 for Lipscomb\u2019s \u2018\u2018 eyes \u2019\u2019 Moore does succeed in\npowerfully reconsidering the post-9\/11 US relationship between justice and\nsecurity. And that, it has to be said, cannot be dismissed lightly. This might\nbe among the reasons why, at the end of his ambivalent review of Fahrenheit\n9\/11, David Edelstein concludes that the film is \u2018\u2018an act of counter-\npropaganda that has a boorish bullying force. It is, all in all, a legitimate abuse\nof power \u2019\u2019 (Edelstein 2004). But I wonder if this supposed I\/eye-swap ever\ntakes place. For how Moore uses Lipscomb in Fahrenheit 9\/11 is not to mouth\nthe extremely complex and varied moral objections many Americans have to\nthe Bush administration\u2019s security policies, but as a mask for his own morally\ncertain opposition to the moral certainty of the Bush administration. In\nFahrenheit 9\/11, then, instead of looking through the eyes of Lila Lipscomb,\nMoore seems to poke Lipscomb\u2019s eyes out and replace them with his own.\nThere is an eye-swap here, but it is not Moore\u2019s for Lipscomb\u2019s (as it appears\nto be) but Lipscomb\u2019s for Moore\u2019s.\nUltimately what this means is that Lila Lipscomb\u2019s feminine role in\nFahrenheit 9\/11 may well end up containing the policies of the US state and\nundermining the administration of the US president. But they fail to contain\nMoore, to bring him back from the brink of his vigilante journalism (with all\nof its pejorative connotations). Instead, it is Lila Lipscomb who is contained,\nand in containing her, what is also contained is the possibility to re-envision\nthe post-9\/11 relationship between justice and security in anything other\nthan the morally certain terms shared by both Bush and Moore \u2013 \u2018\u2018us \u2019\u2019\/good\nvs. \u2018\u2018 them\u2019\u2019\/bad.\nAll this makes me conclude that Moore\u2019s abuse of power is not legitimate.\nMoore\u2019s cooption of the face of Lila Lipscomb as his own \u2018\u2018 I \u2019\u2019 is surely not\nthe moral act it purports to be. It could not be more different from what\nMoore\u2019s film suggests it is \u2013 a swapping of Moore\u2019s \u2018\u2018eyes \u2019\u2019 for those of\nLipscomb. While Lipscomb\u2019s \u2018\u2018 eyes\/I \u2019\u2019 is always coopted and framed by\nMichael Moore, there is another \u2018\u2018 I \u2019\u2019 that Fahrenheit 9\/11 cannot contain, the\n\u2018\u2018 I \u2019\u2019 suggested by its title. Turning the \u2018\u2018eyes\/I \u2019\u2019 of Ray Bradbury back onto\nthe \u2018\u2018 I \u2019\u2019 of Michael Moore, Bradbury would surely see in Fahrenheit 9\/11many\nof the things he warned America(ns) about in his novel Fahrenheit 451.\nThe Temperature Where Morality Burns 129\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nBentley, Tom and Ian Hargreaves. \u2018\u2018 Introduction : The New Ideology, \u2019\u2019 in Tom Bentley and\nDaniel Stedman Jones, eds., The Moral Universe.
