The embodied brain seems to be today at the forefront of attempts to \nestablish post-positivistic approaches in social science and social theory as well as non-reductionist \nconceptions of the brain and body in neuroscience, developmental science and psychology. But \nembodiment not only challenges prevalent epistemic and cultural assumptions in these disciplines; it \nalso opens avenues for exploring the plasticity and the emergent epigenetic nature of the brain and \nbody. Plasticity occupies the brain-body imaginary of today's epoch. At the heart of the imaginary of \nplasticity lies the possibility of recombining brain-body matter and understanding the making of \necologically dependent morphologies in a non-determinist manner. But plasticity as recombination \nbecomes not only a radical challenge to prevailing determinist assumptions about the brain-body in \nWestern thought, it becomes also a forceful element of its own regeneration and actualization. \n \n \n \n  - 2 - \nI. Recombination and plasticity \n \nEvery epoch has its brain. And every epoch fantasises a better brain than the one it has. Today, one \ncan see early signs of a shift from a cognition oriented and centralised brain dominating research for \nmany decades towards an extended, connected and most importantly embodied understanding of the \nbrain, towards the brain-body. In neuroscience, developmental science and psychology the concept \nof embodiment is used to grasp the idea that mental and brain processes are embedded in a material \nbody and in a structured environment. In social science, cultural theory and social theory \nembodiment is employed to address questions of difference by foregrounding the socio-cultural \nmaking of the body and of experience. \n In both, though often very disparate, disciplines embodiment is presented as an answer to the \nshortcomings of the sciences of the brain which have treated the brain as a self-contained, \ndecontextualized entity; an answer to the shortcomings of genocentric deterministic approaches \nwhich have neglected the role of the environment; and finally embodiment appears as an answer to \nthe shortcomings of various essentialist conceptualizations of difference, primarily gender and race, \nand the untenable foundationalism of related political movements. The concept of embodiment \nappears to exercise an almost therapeutic function: it promises to heal the deep discontent within \n'Western thought' (cf. Lakoff and Johnson, 1999). \n This piece explores connections and mutations of these various usages of the concept of the \nembodied brain in relation to the shifting cultural and political imaginaries of societies in the Global \nNorth. I argue that these shifts pertain to a new master narrative of changing the brain-body which \nthrives on the technoscientific ambition to monitor, control and transform processes of life on the \nvery level of their material composition. 'Today we are learning the language in which God created \nlife' declared President Clinton in his announcement on the decoding of the human genome on \nMonday 26th June 2000. As I could not not recall Wittgenstein's (1958) canon at this moment \u2013 that \nlanguage exists only when it is actively used \u2013 a daunting vision appeared to me: practicing the \nlanguage of creation. Secular creationism. The ability to recombine brain-body matter and to produce \nnew sociomaterial forms of existence. \nThe underlying presupposition of conceiving brain-body matter as amenable to \nrecombination is that it characterised by plasticity. But plasticity is not a new concept as such; it has a \nlong history in neuroscientific research and traditional brain research. The question is what kind of \nplasticity is assumed here. Today's plasticity starts where the gene stops: the specificity of the \nindividual organism. Plasticity appears when epigenetics is at work: the worldly making and remaking \nof the totality of an organism in the process of its development. Rather than just the relative \nmalleability of brain matter, plasticity now refers to the possibility of recombining brain-body matter. \nNot as an abstract and general process of neuronal regeneration but as a process that takes place \nepigenetically, that is according to the specific and contingent realities of each particular organism. \n'Genes and genius: Does everyone have the potential to be a genius? Epigenetics offers hope for us \nall' is the title of a review of David Shenk's (2010) popularisation of epigenetics for everyone in the \nNew Scientist (27 March 2010:  51). This understanding of plasticity sneaks in to the cultural imaginary \nof the body and brain of the Global North as a promise. And as a practice: In the near future we will \nbe able to create new neurons 'at will, where and when you need them' (Horstman and Scientific \nAmerican, 2010:  5). Neuroplasticity as neurogenesis from below.  \n  - 3 - \nIn this piece I collect various materials that can furnish a historical reconstruction of \nconceptualisations of the brain-body from the vantage point of its understanding as plastic and \namenable to recombination. This is a speculative story in which previous conceptualisations and \nvisions of the brain-body are read through the prism of recombinant plasticity. Such a story has of \ncourse many limitations \u2013 its linearity seems to be the most apparent one \u2013 but at the end it is \nnothing else than an experiment: if every epoch has its brain and if the recombinant plastic brain is \nthe brain to come then the aim of this piece is to fabulate by telling a partial story of the recombinant \nplastic brain's own history through its own eyes. The next section discusses various existing cultural \nimaginaries of the brain-body exploring how the embodied brain modifies them and comes to \nbecome the prevalent vision of the brain-body today. The sections that follow trace the links \nbetween these imaginaries and the epistemic genealogy of embodiment and recombinant plasticity. \nSection II discusses the move from behaviourism to cognitivism and then to connectionism. \nConnectionism was crucial for preparing the ascent of theories of embodiment. Section IV focuses \non different approaches to the embodiment of the brain and its relation to experience. Section V \ninvestigates the relation of embodiment to culture and polity of contemporary societies. In the same \nway that cognitivism and connectionism prepared the way for the emergence of embodied \napproaches, section VI argues that embodiment opens the view towards an understanding of the \nbrain and body as recombinant and plastic. Section VII reviews epigenetics and ecomorphs as two \nmanifestations of the developmental and ecological plasticity of the brain-body. The concluding \nsection of the paper raises possible political implications of the imaginary of recombinant plasticity. \n \n \nII. The cultural ordering of the embodied brain  \n \nHow is the embodied brain-body situated in relation to other existing brain-body cultural topoi. \nTopos is a conventional place, it refers to common topics of reference; but topos is not about \ncommon themes and motifs of argumentation which we deploy, it also refers to the idea of place as \nconcrete socio-material space where processes of materialization take place (Barad, 1998). Topos \nrefers equally to symbolic commonality (shared meaning) and to material space (lived place). Topos is \nthe place where we physically convene to partake in dealing with common concerns. In this sense, \neach different brain-body topos constitutes a specific semiotic and material arrangement that is \nhistorically and culturally limited and that operates as a space of interaction, conflict and negotiation \nover the making and remaking of our brain-body. In particular, theories of embodiment come and \nadd themselves to the arena of other topoi (s. Gilbert, 1997; cf. also Bordo, 1990; Frank, 1991; \nHaraway, 1991; Martin, 1992), engage with them, challenge them, and participate in the creation of \nnew social and material realities and imaginaries than these that existed before.  \n Probably the most powerful of these cultural imaginaries of the brain-body is the topos of the \ncerebral body: the body which exists as the carrier of the intellect, as the site of cognition. The \nquestion of the materiality of the cerebral body is a question of inferior importance; its logic is based \non taming, suppressing, canalizing brain energies and bodily feelings. Flesh has to be controlled \nbecause it is the 'source of epistemological error, moral error, and mortality' (Csordas, 1994a:  8; s. \nalso Leder, 1990). The cerebral body celebrates exuberant production of knowledge and deploys it to \ncontrol the complex processes of its own physicality and materiality. The cerebral body pretends to \n  - 4 - \nbe universalist, normative, expansive, gender-free and culture-free. It searches for brain modules \n(Fodor, 1983; Scholl and Leslie, 1999), for deterministic procedures, for fixed algorithms in order to \nidentify the normal ideal brain\/body. The cerebral body is the value producing body, the flesh which \nhas use value, the able body \u2013 as opposed to the non-productive and disabled body, whose \ncorporeality has always to be corrected (cf. Breckenridge and Vogler, 2001). \n A parallel body topos focuses on a different type of control: the immune body is obsessed \nwith protection, with the creation and maintenance of boundaries. The topos of the immune body is \nconcerned with prediction of possible damages and contaminations; it concentrates on the \ntechniques of repair, normalization and segregation. In the topos of the immune body, research aims \nto demarcate the limits of the body, its durability, its widths of tolerance. The immune body 'is a \nbody that separates us from the other bodies that inhabit the globe and that prohibits our fusing with \nother entities. The immune body is that which determines our Hobbesian selfness and is in potential \nconflict with every body' (Gilbert, 1997:  38). The immune body is primarily concerned with the \nproduction of knowledge which conserves and defends, which opposes weakness, which anticipates \nwhat is essential for protection and preservation of the body's processes. 'What we need to do better \nis be predictive. We have to be proactive. We have to develop the capability to anticipate attacks. We \nhave to develop the capability of looking around corners. And that is the change. That is the shift in \nfocus particularly at headquarters' in the words of Robert S. Mueller III, Director of the U.S. Federal \nBureau of Investigation after the New York events of 9\/11 (Mueller III, 2002).  \nThe immune body is obsessed with the threat of sudden death. But death here is not \nconsidered as a natural phenomenon, it is a process which can be forced from outside, it designates \nthe break down of the body's boundaries. Death can be anticipated, prevented and the immune \nbody's main task is to pre-empt death. The temporal register of the immune body is the future. The \nfuture is open to vulnerabilities, the future is the reservoir of possible threats that can trigger the \nbody's implosion, dissolution and death. For example, when HIV erupted in Western gay \ncommunities in the mid 1980s, it initially triggered a moral panic, not over the actual deaths it caused, \nbut over what it suggested about the vulnerability of the body \u2013 and of the body politic (Martin, \n1990). HIV become a signifier of how gay men subverted the masculinist fantasy of the intact body \nunderpinning the heterosexual matrix (Crimp, 1988; Weeks, 1995). A fantasy that assumed that \nmasculine bodies are immune, protected, impenetrable (Irigaray, 1985; Roberts et al., 1996) in the \nsame way that nation states are assumed to be controlled and sovereign territories. The topos of the \nimmune body is less about the negation of this vulnerability and more about anticipating how to \navoid them, how to avoid potential infection, disease and death. The immune body is plagued by fear.  \n The only antidote to fear is to exit the materiality of the body altogether. This is the topos of \nthe discarnate body which provides this exit, relief from the vulnerability of the flesh. The discarnate \nbody introduces the fantasy of the pure self, incorporeal, fleshless, liberated from the passions, \nhabits, and weakness of its facticity. The discarnate body is the home of pure ideas, clean thoughts, \nuncontested intellectuality. Against the immune and cerebral body topoi which concentrate on the \nproduction of different types of knowledge, the discarnate body cultivates sanctity. Rather than \nproducing knowledge to tame the body or to protect it, the discarnate body is the site of faith. The \ndiscarnate body is less about exploring and experimenting with its immanent functions, origins and \nboundaries and more about confidence in some transcendent order and purpose of the body. The \n  - 5 - \ndiscarnate body is orientated towards a temporality which is outside of lived time. Its powerfulness \nlies with the authoritative effect this infinite temporality has on everyday practical commitments.  \n In the topos of the discarnate body time is infinite while the universal cerebral flesh is a place \nwithout time, out of time. The topos of the immune body is defined by the synchronic affections \nbetween different bodies. The diachronic axis, the evolutionary history of flesh, is captured in the \ntopos of the hereditary body: the search for genetic algorithms, for the ultimate code of development \n(Dennett, 1995). The hereditary body is the body which is the result of gene expression; it purports \nto tell the objective natural history of the flesh. The hereditary body is the body which marks and \ncategorises origins: it is the topos in which gender is constructed as sex, it is the topos in which the \nracialisation of peoples of colour and migrants unfolds, it is the topos which cultivates the saga of \ndeep belongings (nation, language) through supposed common body architectures. The hereditary \nbody is concerned with time past, it sees the future as a continuation of its given evolutionary roots, \nit attempts to diminish the synchronic pressures on the brain and the body and to minimize \nuncertainty. \n What is common to all these temporal registers is that the flow of time is external to the \nbody. It constitutes the background against which each of these different body imaginaries occur. In \nall these temporal orders time is pre-existent, it is a neutral trajectory that runs quasi objectively and \nuniformly independently of the actually changing brain-bodies. But if we think of time as a creative \nforce, not as just a neutral trajectory but as an intensive element in brain-body's metamorphoses, then \na different cultural vision of the brain-body appears: the topos of emergence. If we 'temporalize time' \nitself (Sandbothe, 1998), the brain-body becomes simultaneously the subject and object of its own \nregeneration. The emergent brain-body responds on the one hand to formations of life which evolve \nas the time of life flows and creates new unpredictable and novel configurations of existence. This \nreal lived time is the time of development: the emergent body exists in the realm of its own \ndevelopmental trajectory and actuality (Gilbert and Epel, 2009; Gottlieb, 1997). On the other hand it \nis emergent because the creation of new forms is always limited by the actually existing contingent \nconditions of existence (for an extended discussion of emergent architectures of being see Cooper, \n2008; and Chapters 8 and 9 in Papadopoulos, Stephenson, and Tsianos, 2008).  The emergent \nand embodied brain-body is unthinkable, indeed impossible to exist, outside of the formative \nchronotope of ontogenesis. If the hereditary body conjugates the notion of predisposition in \ndifferent versions (cf. Gould, 1977), the emergent body refers to how lived ecologies shape the brain-\nbody iteself. The imaginary of the emergent brain-body has a strong resemblance with Deleuze and \nGuattari's (1987) understanding of nomadism as a state of openness of a body to its own construction \nthrough its movements, rather than through an externally imposed form of organisation. \n \n \nIII. From cognitivism to connectionism \n \nThese different cultural imaginaries of the brain-body are tightly interwoven with existing epistemic \nlanguages and practices of the brain-body. While every epoch has its brain, not every epoch considers \nthe brain as the seat of thinking and consciousness. In ancient Greece the higher parts of the soul \nreside in the heart; similarly, traditional Chinese medicine sees the heart as the house of the mind; \nDescartes considered the pineal gland as the seat of thinking. With the rise of medicine in the mid-\n  - 6 - \nend of the 19th century that the brain becomes a systematic object of study. But even then the brain \nis far from being the seat of thinking and consciousness. Until the 1950s the functions and the \npsychology of the brain are black-boxed through the dominance of behaviourism. With the dispute \nover the ultra positivistic Skinnerian program the behaviourist mechanistic Stimulus-Response (S-R) \nmodel comes gradually under attack. The main task is to rehabilitate the very idea of 'thinking' in \npsychological and brain research. There were many predecessors to this endeavour (e.g. Woodworth, \n1921, 1938) since behaviourism's expulsion of thinking from psychology at the beginning of the 20th \ncentury (J. B. Watson, 1913). Dewey's (Dewey, 1999; see also Baldwin, 1897) vision of the mind as a \nsocial process contested the behaviourist view of mind and thinking. In the first decades of the 20th \ncentury pragmatism presented a viable and lively alternative to the obliteration of thinking, \ncnsciousnees and experience in dominant academic discourses but could not challenge the \ndominance of the behaviourist model. It is only much later that pragmatism's approach informed \nresearch on the brain-body through its influence on certain strands of connectionism and \nembodiment. In this moment, however, none of these endeavours precipitated a fundamental turn in \nresearch on mind and consciousness, such as the one which took place with the rise of cognitivism in \nthe 1950s. \nE.Ch. Tolman (1954) was among those who formulated basic outlines for the new trend in \nresearch on thinking few decades before the emergence of the cognitivist movement. He introduced \nthe idea of 'intervening variables' which was an attempt to dissect the entire phenomenon of \nbehaviour in order to achieve a new homogeneous synthesis. The response is no more a linear, direct \ncorrelate of the stimulus that takes place after a certain time lag. It is a function of the stimulus that \ndepends on the environment, the need system and the belief-value matrix of the individual. The \ninternal plane of human consciousness becomes the core centre for the regulation of behaviour. \nEmphasizing the idea that thinking is a function was a key moment for the emergence of \ncognitivism. For example, Jerome Bruner, one of the protagonists of the cognitive turn, saw a \npossibility for derailing behaviourist dominance in the insertion of a new middle link in the S-R \npattern that would allow the investigation of this internal plane of thinking. This link was the 'sign-\nmediated-thought' (Bruner, 1967). Thinking is elucidated as an organon with specific functions. The \n'output' of a certain 'input' is no longer immediately predictable, but is now mainly a function of \nthinking. But, with the suspension of prediction, the scientistic presuppositions required to assert the \nnatural scientific character of research seem to vanish. In the mid fifties \u2013 a period in which \nsignificant publications (by Chomsky, Newell, Simon etc) and events (such as the MIT Symposium \non Information Theory) in the history of cognitivism took place (Gardner, 1987:  28) \u2013 Bruner, \nGoodnow and Austin (1956) publish A Study of Thinking. Here they proclaim that rule-learning, \ncategorization, and processes of abstraction are the main functions of thinking. Thinking is not only \nabout representing, but mainly about problem solving, it is a function. The quest becomes then how \nto visualise the 'invisible' domain of this functions. The answer to this was the idea of \ncomputionalism: cognitive processes constitute a standard set of procedures which can be reduced to \npre-defined lower level processes (Churchland, 1986). Cognition emerges in 'patterns of data and in \nrelations of logic that are independent of the physical medium that carries them' (Pinker, 1997:  24). \n Even if cognitivism is still the dominant paradigm of research in the field of psychology and \nneuroscience, there is an increasing focus on producing systematic knowledge of somatocognitive \nprocesses which can be generalized without relapsing into the universalism and essentialism of \n  - 7 - \ncomputationalism. One could read experimental neuroscience's obsession with mapping \npsychological functions and subjectivity on the brain (Beaulieu, 2003; Dumit, 2004; Joyce, 2005) as \nanother step in the long history of localizationism (Star, 1989) that attempted to uncover how the \nrelation between mind and brain is constituted. The brain mapping of subjectivity through new \nvisualisation technologies that correlate psychological functions with brain areas seems to perpetuate \na traditional abstract view of the brain as a fully formed, static modular structure (Littlefield, 2009; \nKarmiloff-Smith, 1992). But it also reveals an attempt to go beyond the use of embodiment as a \nfigural or metaphoric concept \u2013 even if this usage is fruitful and certainly also inexorable, as I will \nargue later \u2013 in order to sketch direct relations between experiential processes and intersubjectivity to \nthe material workings (i.e. brain activity and neurobiological processes) of the body (cf. Cromby, \n2007; Franks, 2010; Scott, 2001). \n In this attempt connectionism represents an important step in moving away from cognitivism \ntowards an understanding of the embodied brain. Connectionism promises the possibility of \nunravelling the structural relations between perception, cognition, action and affect by conceiving all \nthese dimensions of existence as linked directly on the neuronal infrastructure of the brain. \nConnectionist research in experimental neuroscience (e.g. Thelen and Smith, 1994; Liben, 1999; \nWilson, 1998) visualises the embodiment of the brain on the material-neurobiological level. Neuronal \nnetworks depict complex assemblies of interconnected nerve cells where certain synapses constitute \ncentral nodes in the network while other occupy more peripheral positions. The process of \nontogenetic development sees the birth, change and decline of many such connectionist nets \nmaterialised through the webs of neurons (Changeux, 1997; Edelman, 1989; Edelman and Tononi, \n2000).  \n A crucial change that connectionist modelling introduces is the questioning of \n'representational nativism' that is prevalent in cognitivist approaches: cortical development depends \non genetically driven microcircuitry that accounts for the organisation of brain functions. Mental \nrepresentations in cognitivism are the result of innate neurophysiological processes that are context \nindependent and universal in the human brain. Thinking has universal algorithmic structure and \nresides in fixed neuronal architectures. Against all this '[i]n a connectionist network, representations \nare patterns of activations across a pool of neuron-like processing units. The form of these activation \npatterns is determined by the nature of the connections between the units. Thus, innate \nrepresentational knowledge ... would take the form of prespecified weights on the inter-unit \nconnections' (Elman et al., 1996:  25). What is crucial in connectionism is that the weighting of the \nnodes is not given but emerges through learning. This is the moment where the idea of a malleable \nbrain matter that its characterised by its emergent qualities and its dependence on the surroundining \nenvironment comes to being. While computationalism presupposes innate neuronal structures, \nconnectionism presupposes semi-open, nonlinear architectures that unfold during the very process of \nontogenetic development. Brain matter is simultaneously the actor and the result of its own activity. \nBrain matter becomes formed as it becomes active, but it is active only because this activity shapes \nthe brain into specific forms. Connectionism is a crucial move away from the essentialism and \nuniversalism of cognitivism; the formation of brain matter is emergent, that is contextual: it depends \non the intra-organismic and extra-organismic ecosystems. This move prepares a conceptualisation of \nbrain matter as embodied.  \n  - 8 - \n  \nIV. Experience and embodiment \n \nThe embodied approach adds a significant dimension to connectionist modelling of the brain. \nEmbodiment is not only about the syntactic structures of meaning but also aims to encompass the \nsemantics of experience \u2013 the production of meaning \u2013 and the pragmatics of experience \u2013 that is \ncontext-dependent and culture-dependent aspects of meaning. Context and experience merge into \nthe workings of brain matter. It is not a coincidence that social, cultural and critical psychological \ntheories of embodiment engage with the study of the brain-body relation: existentialism and \nphenomenology (Heidegger, 1993; Merleau-Ponty, 1966), social constructionism (Cromby, 2004) and \ncultural-historical psychological accounts (Vygotsky, 1987; Wygotski, 1987; see also Papadopoulos, \n2010c). The embodiment of brain matter means that mental functions are not formal procedures; \ncognition is not independent of its implementation; mind and experience is always instantiated in \nconcrete material structures: in a body (Damasio, 2004; Lakoff and Johnson, 1999; Varela, \nThompson, and Rosch, 1991), in an environment (Clark, 1997; Edelman, 1992; Lewontin, 2000a; S. \nRose, 1998), in a social context (Csordas, 1994b; Harr\u00e9, 1996; Overton, 1998; Sampson, 1996), or in \ncultural-political constellations (Bourdieu, 1987; Braidotti, 2002; Fausto-Sterling, 2000). From the \nperspective of embodiment there is no such thing as the brain as a fully separate organ. We can think \nof the brain not as such but as part of, as embedded in, as being in relation to other functions and systems \nof the body. This is the reason I use the word 'brain-body' when I talk about the body or the brain in \ntheories of embodiment. \n Conceptualizations of the embodied brain-body vary immensely in content and scope though \n(Ziemke, 2001). In its weak form embodiment simply means that cognitive functions take place in a \nphysical substratum. More elaborate versions understand the brain-body as a multilayered, \nmultifunctional, self-organizing system consisting of interacting subsystems. This version is very \ncommon: cognition, perception, emotion, action are not separate but interact continuously and shape \nour understanding of the self and of the world. Another approach to the embodied brain-body \nemphasizes its phenomenological dimensions as the existential ground of thinking. Our bodily \nmovements, orientations are, literally, the ground on which our mental concepts and abstractions \nbuild. 'No matter how sophisticated our abstractions become, if they are to be meaningful to us, they \nmust retain their intimate ties to our embodied modes of conceptualization and reasoning. We can \nonly experience what our embodiment allows us to experience. We can only conceptualize using \nconceptual systems grounded in our bodily experience' (Johnson, 1999, p. 81). Another widespread \nversion of the concept of embodiment emphasizes the brain-body as an active agent absorbing, \nmodifying, transforming social, cultural and symbolic forces. The brain-body in all these \nunderstandings is the human body. Many extend this approach to include the artificial, organismoid \nor humanoid body and its relations to the human body: embodiment in these accounts refers to \nhybrid machines which are able to act in real-time and real-space environments and not to machines \nwhich act in virtual space or in protected, experimental environments (cf. Chrisley and Ziemke, 2002; \nBrooks, 2001). \n All these divergent approaches and countless descendant theories of embodiment propose \nthat our conceptual and experiential systems are inextricably linked to the sensorimotor and affective \nfunctions of the brain-body. Experience starts with the affective-perceptual sensing of the \n  - 9 - \nenvironment and with locomotion in it. Experience is realised in the brain-body, through the brain-\nbody, on the neuronal connections which are formed by the continuous interaction of the different \nbodily subsystems and the environment. From an intra-organismic perspective the embodied brain is \nthe steadily transforming brain in a process of constantly monitoring and interacting with the totality \nof the body and the brain itself. The self we have, the experiences that make us cannot exist without \na brain that represents its own state and the state of the body in which it is embedded (Damasio, \n1999; LeDoux, 2002).  \nEpistemologically the perspective of the embodied brain constitutes a direct challenge to \ngenetic reductionism, nativism and to a decontextualised and abstract understanding of the brain. But \nit does more than that. Developmental Systems Theory \u2013 which was an important agent in \nchallenging genetic reductionism by advocating a holistic approach to the evolution of the embodied \nbrain (Oyama, 2000; Lewontin, 2000b; Gottlieb, 1992) \u2013 has showed that embodiment is not just \nabout decentring the brain into the body of the organism but mainly about decentring the whole \norganism itself. Rather than reducing the unit of analysis to the organism itself Developmental \nSystems Theory proclaims that embodiment is always dependent on intra- and inter-organismic \nrelations. There is no embodiment if there are no other bodies around. The embodiment of the brain \nis the becoming embodied with other bodies and through other bodies, it is about symbiosis rather \nthan perseverance of single organisms, as Margulis and Sagan (2003) put it. Embodiment means \nrelationality and co-construction. \nThe brain of today's epoch seems to be one that is characterised by its relational architectures \nin an ongoing formation of brain-body matter. That every epoch has its brain means that the brain it \nenacts becomes also the actor of its own existential conditions. In this sense, theories of embodiment \nare not just abstract immaterial representations of somato-material processes. Rather they are active \nforces in the transformation of existing social and material realities; they even transform the very \nexistential conditions of the brain-body itself. Hence, the embodied approach to the brain is literally \nembodied, it is not monitoring reality or specific neurobiological, developmental or social processes, \nit is the process itself: it recombines pre-existing material and creates new ways of being and new \n'forms of life' (Winner, 1986; see also Papadopoulos, 2011). Theories of embodiment induce new \nmodes of existence fostering combinations on all different levels of organization, genetic, neural, \norganismic, environmental\/social, combinations which were not present before.  \n \n \nV. The politics of embodiment: emancipation and control \n \nThe epistemic and cultural construction of the embodied brain-body, discussed in the previous \nsections, corresponds to the body politics of emancipation movements which initially arose after the \n1970s and 1980s. Foucault (1995) made a substantial contribution to placing the brain-body in the \ncentre of academic debates in the humanities and social sciences, but it is feminist and queer politics \n(e.g. Alaimo and Hekman, 2008; Clarke and Olesen, 1998; De Lauretis, 1987), critical studies of \nscience, technology and medicine (e.g. Bauchspies and Puig de la Bellacasa, 2009; Clarke et al., 2010; \nHaraway, 1991; Latimer and Schillmeier, 2009; Myers, 2008; Rapp, 2000), critiques of disembodied \ninformation systems and representational information technologies (Lilley, Lightfoot, and Amaral, \n2004; Hayles, 1999) and various indigenous and antiracist movements that released the idea of the \n  - 10 - \nbody as a political potentiality (Turner, 1984:  247). The topos of the embodied and emergent brain-\nbody becomes an open field where essentialist and formulaic understandings of the workings of the \nbrain-body are rewritten and reconfigured under the guise of their social and political significance. \n'Body politics' (Blanche, Bhavnani, and Hook, 1999) directly correspond with the deployment of \nconcept of embodiment and emergence in neuroscience, developmental science and psychology. It is \nimpossible to establish a feasible theoretical approach to the brain-body without challenging the \ndeterministic understanding of its material workings. Making the brain-body permeable to the \npressures of the emancipation movements was coextensive with contesting the impermeability and \nuniversality of the scientific biological brain-body. In fact the emancipation discourses of the \nemergent brain-body infuse social antagonisms into the realm of science.  \n But emancipation movements through brain-body politics constitute only one of the ways \nembodiment and emergence figure in social practices and the cultural imaginary. At the same \nmoment, along with emancipation discourses, the emergent and embodied brain-body captures the \ndesire for a regenerating brain-body in the fatigued North-Atlantic societies. It is a brain-body which \ntries to overcome discourses of intrusion, death, and origins by viewing itself as the all-in-one \nsolution: it is source, site, and target of its own regenerative practices. Thus, even if the topos of the \nemergent brain-body privileges contextuality and specificity, its logic is precisely based on an idea of \nneutralizing the notion of limit and context as imposed by other brain-body discourses. The \nemergent brain-body represents a particularly vicious form of cultural universalism: It promises \nhealing not in terms of correction (cerebral body), protection (immune body), or the ideology of a \nfixed origin (hereditary body) but in terms of its very own open reconstruction and recombination. \n Embodiment promises to engage with the lived pains of the body, the tamed flesh, the \ntortured flesh, the oppressed flesh (Scarry, 1985; Duden, 2002). But at the same time this promise is \nvery localized in its scope: it hinges on the belief in a recombinant individual agent; a belief and a \npractice which interrupts and simultaneously invigorates the political dictum of neoliberal societies of \nthe Global North: sole individuals localized in the power grids of the market which are never \ndiscernible as such. The ambivalence of the topos of the embodied and emergent brain-body is that \nit arose as a powerful critical practice that question the prevalent decontextualised and out-of-time \nindividualism circulating in everyday culture as well as in neuroscience, evolutionary biology and \npsychology\/developmental science in Global North societies. But this thrust towards undoing the \nindividual agent was gradually appropriated in the discourse of the flexible individual that comes to \nreplace previous ideas about the abstract rational autonomous agent (Papadopoulos, 2003). The \nflexible individual concentrates on its self-modification in order to achieve success in the present by \nneglecting broader future consequences of its actions (Schull and Zaloom, 2011). Social, subjective, \nneuronal flexibility is not just the target or the modus operandi of self-relationality, rather it is the \nvery condition of embodied liberal individualism in the Global North. Control is embodied, it is \nexercised through being placed in a constant process of modifying our very own material existences \n(see Pitts-Taylor, 2010; and the editorial in Cromby, Newton, and Williams, 2011). Individuals are in \na permanent process of self-maintenance; one could almost believe that we never die and we never \nlive, we are just perpetually maintaining and working on our brains and bodies (Martin, 2010). \nContemporary political governance encounters the individual as an assemblage of ideas, limbs, hi-\ntech devices, chemical substances, environmental factors which is continuously creating and re-\n  - 11 - \ncreating itself, striving to achieve a specific position in a social nexus which could never be \nidentifiable as a whole (Martin, 2002; Papadopoulos, 2008). \nThe ambivalence of the embodied brain-body is its double affiliation with emancipation and \ncontrol at the same time: the movement towards embodiment was initiated by the pressures of \ncritical social movements and social activism (in particular feminist, gay and antiracist movements) \non the technoscientific knowledge grid that researches the brain and the body. But the liberating \nbrain-body worlds that these emancipatory movements put in motion are gradually being \nappropriated in the neoliberal geoculture emerging after the 1980s. This could be understood as a \nfailure of these emancipatory movements. But this understanding would mean that there are clean, \npure, everlasting liberatory answers. This is not the case; rather the appropriation of emancipatory \nthinking and activism testifies for the importance and centrality of its critique in social life and its \ncapacity to change the conditions of existence (Papadopoulos, Stephenson, and Tsianos, 2008). \nAgainst the positions that see critical thinking and activism as a marginal and marginalising discourse \n(e.g. Latour, 2004), the history and practice of the embodied brain-body supports a different \nperspective. Emancipatory movements have opened a space for performing the brain-body as \nembodied, a space that did not exist before, a space that came before control and had the capacity to \ncreate new liberating conditions. The existence of new libratory forms of existence forced control to \nchange and reorganise itself in order to be able to respond to and finally appropriate these \nmovements: the idea of the embodied brain-body was gradually appropriated into the discourse of \nregenerating the brain-body through its own recombination. \n \n \nVI. From embodiment and emergence to plasticity and autogeneric brain-bodies \n \nThe quest for recombination is not just an abstract ideal reverberating through the parallel discourses \nof social emancipation and social control; it is firmly located in the socio-technical materialities of \nexistence. Embodiment and emergence have, for example, a crucial impact on the rearrangement of \nthe fields of artificial intelligence and artificial machines by instigating a radical practical critique of \ncognitivist models in robotics (Balsamo, 1995; Hayles, 1999; Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, 1991). \nOne of the core assumptions of these models is that it is potentially possible to duplicate the \nfunctions of the human mind and to create an artificial quasi human brain. This quasi-brain should \nbe able to execute control over the sensorimotor subsystems and to act as a controlling device \nresponsible for autonomous problem solving. In this view, cognition again dominates the circuits of \naction, affect and perception. This perspective has been proven untenable in the field of robotics, \nespecially in relation to humanoid robots (Brooks, 1991; Hayles, 1999). Not only are we far from \nduplicating the human brain or from creating quasi-brains sufficient for steering humanoid systems, \nbut the research on vision and motion has made considerable advances that question the possibility \nof constructing of a quasi-brain. Theories of embodiment attempt to overcome this inconsistency of \ncognitivist approaches: they link cognition directly to motion and perception circuits (increasingly \nalso to affective) and question the necessity of the existence of a quasi-brain at all (Brooks, 2002). \nEmbodiment is the key strategy for creating new emerging non-human actors from a situated \nperspective. \n  - 12 - \n The new humanoid robots get rid of the pressure to have consciousness implanted in their \nartificial brain-body by a human hand. They need only simple cognitive architectures, sophisticated \nsensorimotor subsystems, fast hardware and a sufficient repertoire of social-emotional skills. Inspired \nby animal behaviour and movement, embodied approaches to robotics use semi-open connectionist \nnets to link together different brain-body subsystems of humanoid machines and create new social \nactors. These new machines possess agency and are genuinely emergent (Sonigo, 2005): simple \nperceptions trigger bodily movements, bodily movements elicit cognitive procedures, in turn these \norganise perception, failures of the activity produce new affective states, affects intensify bodily \nmovements and new communication scripts, which require faster responses and new more \ncomplicated cognitive procedures and so on. In the realm of situated robotics complexity is not a gift \nfrom the humans to the machines. In fact all what humans can do is to reduce complexity and \nsimplify brain processes and body architectures. What these new machines do is far more \nsophisticated that what humans can produce: they increase complexity through recombining situated \nand embodied processes in animal-human-machine hybrids (Adam, 1998; Clark, 1998; Kember, \n2003; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2009; Steels and Brooks, 1995; Suchman, 2007).  \nRecombination here points towards something which is more than the reconfiguration of \nexisting embodied architectures; it evokes biotic machines that will be ultimately capable of reproducing \nthemselves independent of human intervention. It is probably this particular dimension of a self-\norganised reproduction that is central to the imaginary of plasticity that starts circulating in \nneuroscience and popular culture (Pitts-Taylor, 2010). If every epoch has its brain \u2013 and as I argued \ntoday's epoch gravitates around the embodied brain-body \u2013 then every epoch fantasises a better \nbrain-body to have. Embodiment and emergence open the view to the plastic brain. Recombinant \nplasticity is the promise that theories of embodiment and emergence bring with them but cannot \nfully realise. What is crucial here is not only that the brain-body is emergent and embodied but that it \ncan also change itself. The Brain That Changes Itself is the title of Norman Doidge's (2008) New York \nTimes bestseller. What counts is not embodiment per se but the autogeneric possibilities that the \nrecombinant plastic brain-body release. Recombinant plasticity points towards a different model for \nunderstanding brain-body matter, one which is ultimately much more fascinated with self-\nreproducing organic bodies than with distributive networks, self-organised systems and body-\nenvironment interactions which dominate theories of embodiment. \nPlasticity here refers primarily to ecological-developmental plasticity of the brain-body and \nneuronal plasticity. Environmental influences (Gottlieb, Wahlsten, and Lickliter, 1998) and intrinsic \nprocesses of interaction and ecological symbiosis with other bodies (Margulis, 1998) define the range \nof potential phenotypes that can be actualised (Gilbert and Epel, 2009). The plastic brain-body is \npresent to itself, 'self-generating' but also creating new forms through the incessant interactions and \nreconfigurations of the different participating levels of organization. And at the same time it \nconstrained by the contingent limitations which exist in itself and in its ecology (Robert, 2004). It is \nthe interplay between plasticity and specificity, as Steven Rose (1998) puts it, that describes the \ncondition for inserting real life time and real life contexts in the body and the brain. The recombinant \nplastic brain-body is marked by the events as they occur in the multiple interactions between genetic, \nneural, organismic and ecological levels of existence (Gottlieb, 1992), it exists only in real-time and \nreal-world ecologies, thus it can be only understood from an ecological-developmental perspective \n(Sultan, 2007; Muller, 2007). West-Eberhard's (2003) theory of developmental plasticity and Wexler's \n  - 13 - \n(2006) theory of neuroplasticity across the life-span provide solid accounts of how phenotypic \nvariation occurs as a diversified process depending on a multitude of environmental factors, social \nand cultural conditions and the genetic material shaping differently brain-body matter (see also \nJablonka and Lamb, 2005; Huttenlocher, 2002; Gilbert and Epel, 2009). \n \n \nVII. Recombinant plasticity put to work: epigenesis and ecomorphs  \n \nWhat are the concrete manifestations of the plastic brain-body? If intra-somatic and extra-somatic \nfactors in their totality affect the development and making of the brain, then which particular factors \nare important in the formation of brain-body matter and which not? In order to answer this question \none has to investigate the specific environmentally induced variations that affect brain-body \ndevelopment. This is the turn to epigenetics (Gottlieb, 2007; Robert, 2004; van Speybroeck, van de \nVijver, and de Waele, 2002). 'Epigenetics is defined here as those genetic mechanisms that create \nphenotypic variation without altering the base-pair nucleotide sequence of the genes' (Gilbert and \nEpel, 2009:  12). Epigenetic factors are increasingly considered as important for conceiving how \ngenes are (or are not) expressed in processes of development and how environmentally induced \nchanges of the organism can be transmitted to the offspring (Gilbert and Epel, 2009; Calvanese et al., \n2009; Robert, 2004). Epigenetic explanations of human development attempt to grasp the multi-\nfactorial complexity involved in extra-genetic micro-organismic processes and cellular transformation \nas well as in organism-environment interactions (Gottlieb, Wahlsten, and Lickliter, 1998). \nThe study and standardisation of epigenetic factors becomes one of the key innovations that \ndrive basic research and applications from an evolutionary-developmental perspective (Masterpasqua, \n2009; Lamb, 1994). Consider for example research on foetal development (Kiefer, 2007), on gene \nexpression through exposure to different nutritional substances (Landecker, 2011a), the prevalence \nof specific types of degenerative processes associated with later life (Bandyopadhyay and Medrano, \n2003) or the impact of social experiences on phenotypic variation (Champagne, 2010). Epigenesis \nopens up the field of research on the embodied brain-body towards different scales of gene-\nenvironment assemblages. There are enormous variations regarding these scales and this is \nconsidered as the main challenge for further research. Different approaches deliver different answers \nto how each specific level interacts with all others varying from the relation between the DNA and \nproteins, cells, the organism and their environment (Mitchell et al., 1996; Gilbert, 2002). But what is \ncommon to all of them is that the brain-body is a plastic system shaped through the interplay of \nepigenetic factors and our genes.  \nThe moment of the announcement of the human genome project, which was mentioned in \nthe beginning of this paper, was probably one of the last instances of celebration of genetic \nreductionism. To the words of President Clinton that 'we are learning the language in which God \ncreated life' we should probably add: 'Let the race for epigenetics begin!' After the celebrations of the \ndecoding of the human genome have faded and given way to scepticism, Time magazine rushed to \nannounce a new decoding: the decoding of the human epigenome as a new major scientific discovery \n(Time, 8 December 2009). Fifty or even forty years earlier the gene was an absent reference in the \nwidespread scientific fantasies and popular imagination of the brain-body: as retired inspector Tracy \nWaterhouse says in Kate Atkinson's (2010:  251) last novel 'if you said \"gene\" in the seventies people \n  - 14 - \nthought Levi's or Wranglers'. But very quickly it became the floating signifier in the genocentric \nimaginary dominating the end of the previous century. Another turn now: What only few years \nearlier would have been formulated as 'Why your DNA is your destiny' or 'Your genes, your choices' \n(Baker and American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1997) today it reads: 'Why your \nDNA isn't your destiny' (Time, 6 January 2010). Now the task is to codify epigenetic factors, sort out \nsubstances and environmental conditions which inhibit or promote specific gene expressions, \nstandardize the mechanics of the environment-organism interplay and the ecology-development-gene \ninterplay.  \nThe outcome of this interplay is phenotypic variation: ecomorphs. Ecomoprhs are different \nphenotypes depending on the influences of contingent ecological and relational factors in which an \norganism is embedded in (Wainwright and Reilly, 1994). I use the term here in an extended way: \nEcomorphs are standardizations of effects that epigenetic developmental factors (be it intra-\norganismic or extra-organismic) have on a recombinant plastic organism. Ecomorphs are here \nunderstood as stable configurations of ecological-developmental influences and the genetic code. \nThe term is deployed in this context to describe the outcome of research on epigenetics that can be \nstandardized, classified and catalogued with the use of bioinformatics and subsequently made \navailable to the public (or become a marketised as commodity). Ecomorphs are then systematizations \nof what Hannah Landecker (Landecker, 2011b) describes as the constitution of the environment and \nthe social as a biologically meaningful signal in epigenetic research. Reducing and classifying the \nenvironment to a mere signal that induces drastic changes in genetic function is the crucial step in \ndeveloping classifications of causal relations between the environment and the gene. Ecomorphs can \nbe then considered as classifications of the causal coupling between certain environemntal situations \nand a specific expression of genes. Ecomorphs are in this sense the smallest knowledge unit that has \nbiovalue in epigenetic research and can be used for further basic research or other applications. Maps \nof ecomorphs are the product of epigenetics in the same way a map of genes in the human genome \ndatabase was the product of DNA sequencing. But probably the number of ecomorphs will be far \nmore than the approximately 25000 human genes. Ecomorphs will materialise the vision of truly \nlearning how to create life and how to efficiently remake the brain-body. \n  - 15 - \n \nTable 1: Diagram of different approaches to the brain-body  \n \n behaviourism cognitivism connectionism embodiment autogeneric \nunderlying \nmetaphor \nmechanical \ninterface \ndigital computer network \nanimal-human-\nmachine hybrids \nautonomous \nmachines \nmodelled on \nbasic animal \nphysiological \nprocesses \ncontrolled problem \nsolving \ndistributive \nprocesses \nbody-\nenvironment \ninteractions \nreproduction of \norganic bodies \nfunctioning \nprinciple \nstimulus-response \nuniversal \nalgorithms \nnodes and weights \nemergent \narchitectures \nplasticity \norganisation \nprinciple \nblack box centralism decentralism contextualism \nrecombination \nand nonhuman \nagency \nsupposed biological \nsubstratum \nphysiological \nprocesses \ngenes and brain \nmodules \nneural circuits \norganism-\nenvironment \nassemblages \nbiotic machines \nexplanans determinism nativism connectivity relationality epigenesis \ndominant cultural-\npolitical conditions \nFordist state liberal democracies neoliberal geoculture \npostliberal \nenclosures \nsocial movements \nand activism \nworkers \nmovement; social \nliberalism \nChomskyan liberal \negalitarianism; civil \nrights; identity \npolitics \nalter-globalization movements; situated \nknowledges; postmodern perspectivism; \nreverse engineering \nalter-ontological \nactivism and the \ncommoning of \nmatter \n \n \nVIII. The politics of plasticity and the commoning of knowledge \n \nIn the previous sections I tried to sketch a diagram of different approaches to brain-body matter and \ntell the story of the brain-body from the perspective of its plastic capacity to recombine itself. The \nrecombinant plastic brain-body is literally in a process of auto-generation: it becomes a political agent \nthat operates in the very material constraints of the environmental, social and biochemical conditions \nthat make it happen. Plastic brain-body matter becomes the source and target for freeing the brain-\nbody from the constraints of its previous materialisations in behaviousrism, cognitivism, \nconnectionism and embodiment as described throughout this paper (see also a summary of these \ndifferent versions of the brain-body in Table 1). The imaginary of recombinant plasticity is not only a \nradical challenge to 'Western thought', it becomes an element for the ultimate regeneration and \nactualization of Western thought, literally \u2013 the pop story goes like this: 'We'll be able to direct \nchanges: stimulate new brain cells and networks where and when we need them; turn genes off and \non at will to repair brain damage, restore function, and optimize performance; and rewire our brains \nto manipulate memory and even reverse dementia and mental retardation' (Horstman and Scientific \nAmerican, 2010:  8). Parisi and Terranova (2000) remind us that every configuration of the brain-\nbody as a specific type of organism (in our case here it is the self-healing and recombinant plastic \norganism) is the result of the conjoined action of capital and technoscience in Western capitalist \nsocieties.  \n  - 16 - \nThe story of the recombinant plastic brain-body is concomitant with appropriating the \nproduction of ecomorphs and inserting them into free market structures through the corporatization \nand privatization of brain-body research and the proprietizarization of the epigenome (a process \nsimilar to the ongoing biomedicalization of the body explored in Clarke et al., 2010; and Kippax and \nStephenson, 2010). In this process of marketisation it is not only the private sector that plays an \nimportant role but also the state and other civil society organisations. What we see today is the \nformation of vertical actors that comprise of parts of a certain state, parts of global international actors \n(such as the WHO), together with specific private corporations, certain charitable foundations and \nassociations of civil society. These vertical actors which are neither purely private nor public but a \nmix of both attempt to control bioproduction and compete with other vertical actors in the \ndissemination and application of knowledge (for further discussion see Kippax and Stephenson, \n2010). It is in these conditions \u2013 which we elsewhere called postliberal vertical aggregates \n(Stephenson, 2011; Papadopoulos, Stephenson, and Tsianos, 2008) \u2013 that bioproduction and the \ncapitalisation of ecomorphs unfolds. The reduction of ecomoprhs to biovalue cannot be easily \ncriticised from the vantage point of an opposition between the public vs. private interests. The easy \nexplanation of the private appropriation of public goods no longer holds; neither is it possible to \nargue that there is a clear cut distinction between private and civil society interests. Rather, it is a \ncombination of public, private and civil society aggregates that appropriate and create enclosures of \nknowledge that is essentially cooperatively produced in the commons and through the commons \n(Bollier, 2003; Peuter and Dyer-Witheford, 2010).  \nBut the recombinant plastic brain-body caters not only for those who attempt to integrate \nnon-reductionist and non-determinist experimentation with epigenetics into the workings of these \npostliberal capitalist forms of bioproduction, but also for those who see in the plastic brain-body the \npossibility for developing new forms of resistance and new liberating visions of our neural selves \n(Malabou, 2008; S. Watson, 1998). This emancipatory side of the imaginary of recombinant plasticity \ncould even entail the biggest fantasy of all which is so nicely and fallaciously described in the work of \nMalabou (2008). Recombinant plasticity should go as far as to become the self-governed process of \nchallenging the very plasticity of our brain-body: 'To cancel the fluxes, to lower our self-controlling \nguard, to accept exploding from time to time: this is what we should do with our brain' (Malabou, \n2008:  79). If we only had a new political consciousness of the brain, Malabou argues, we would be \nable to steer neuroscience towards a democratic course and achieve neuronal liberation. Here the \nimaginary of recombinant plasticity serves the opposite of what the postliberal aggreagtes perform: it \nencloses the brain-body in the fantasy of a grand coherent historical actor that is able to challenge the \nneoliberal domination of the brain-body and return the brain to the hands of the public. \nPlasticity has something to offer for those who see the plastic brain-body instrumentally as a \nsource for the mere regeneration of late capitalist power and wealth as well as for those who see in \nthe very ontology of the plastic brain-body the promise of a grand political liberation. It even caters \nfor those in-between who see in it a new form of micropolitical regulation through the proliferation \nof neuronal subjectivities (Abi-Rached and Rose, 2010; N. Rose, 2001; Wilson, 2004): the \nrecombinant plastic brain-body as the main instrument for neuro-governance. The plastic brain-body \nhas something for everyone. Its promise is its capacity to become enclosed in the market or in \nfantasies of political liberation or in ordinary processes of governance. Its promise is its universal \nappeal. But isn't every universalism a retreat to a control regime that operates through \n  - 17 - \ndisembodiment and decontextualisation? Aren't at the end all these different types of enclosure \ndifferent variants of ethnocentric universalist political practice?  \nIs it possible to escape these various ethnocentric reincarnations of universalism and \nincorporeality of the imaginary of recombinant plasticity? As with so many other technologies and \nscientific knowledges we know that no form of control can exist without seizing the everyday \nexperience of people and things. And simultaneously no gesture of freedom and justice and care can \nstart without being firmly located in everyday life and in ordinary materiality (Papadopoulos, 2010a, \n2010b, 2011; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2010, 2011; Stephenson and Papadopoulos, 2006). It is in the \neveryday reclaiming and multiplication of brain-body knowledge and practice that the possibility for \ndefying the universalisms of the imaginary of recombinant plasticity lays. In this piece I tried to show \nthat the type of brain-body we believe that we have is the brain-body that enacts its own real \nexistence and shapes itself. If the plastic brain-body is a brain-body open to development and its \necologies and if development and ecology are processes that are essentially located in the everyday \nand do not belong to nobody (that is they are neither public, nor private nor state owned), then the \nplastic brain-body can only be truly enacted outside of the enclosures of capitalisation, grand \nliberation, and neuro-governance. The most crucial question that the emergence of the imaginary of \nrecombinant plasticity brings with it is probably about the return of the brain-body to the everyday \ncommon spaces in which it is created and through which it can only exist: the recombinant plastic \nbrain-body is, borrowing Peter Linebaugh's (2008) term, about the commoning of the brain-body. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAbi-Rached, J.
