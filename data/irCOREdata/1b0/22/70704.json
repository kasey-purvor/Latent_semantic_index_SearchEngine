Tolerance of Senecio vulgaris to \ninfection and disease caused by native and alien rust fungi. Phyto-\npathology 96:718-726. \nPlant defense strategies against pathogen attack can be divided into \neither resistance or tolerance. Variation in tolerance is expressed as differ-\nences in the relationship between host fitness (or yield) and the degree of \ninfection. Plant tolerance of pathogen attack remains poorly understood \nboth in terms of its specific mechanisms and in terms of the evolutionary \nprocesses by which it has arisen. Theoretical models predict that it is the \nresult of coevolution between host and pathogen, suggesting greater toler-\nance in interactions with native as opposed to introduced pathogens. \nTherefore, we quantified and compared the degree of tolerance expressed \nin the interaction of Senecio vulgaris with the rust fungus Coleosporium \ntussilginis, which is native to the UK, and the introduced rust fungus \nPuccinia lagenophorae. We used the reaction norm approach to quantify \ntolerance and its components. The S. vulgaris\u2013C. tussilaginis interaction \nexpressed a significantly greater degree of tolerance, as reductions in host \ngrowth and fitness per unit infection were significantly less than with  \nP. lagenophorae. The key mechanism for this greater tolerance to C. tus-\nsilaginis was a significantly smaller reduction in photosynthesis per unit \ninfection than with P. lagenophorae, at both leaf and whole plant scales. \nThere was no significant difference in the relationship between whole \nplant photosynthesis and host reproduction. We discuss these responses in \nthe context of coevolution for tolerance in host\u2013pathogen interactions. \nAdditional keyword: parasite. \n \nPlant defense strategies against pathogen attack can be divided \ninto either resistance or tolerance. Variation in resistance is ex-\npressed as differences in the severity of infection, whereas varia-\ntion in tolerance is expressed as differences in the relationship \nbetween host fitness (or yield) and the degree of infection (8). In \ncomparable interactions between plants and herbivores, the \nevolutionary and ecological importance of tolerance and resis-\ntance have both been the subject of substantial research (32,33). \nBy contrast, tolerance in plant\u2013pathogen interactions has been \nlittle studied compared with resistance and important questions \nregarding its mechanisms and evolution remain unanswered. \nThe terminology of tolerance remains somewhat unclear, but \nhere we define overall tolerance as any trait (or combination of \ntraits) that reduces or offsets the consequences of parasite attack \non host fitness or yield without inhibiting parasite fitness (based \non Clarke [8]). Since total lifetime fitness is not readily quantified \nexperimentally for either host or parasite, they can be approxi-\nmated using measures such as flower or seed number or reproduc-\ntive dry weight for the host and, at least for leaf-infecting fungi, \nsporulating area for the parasite. Based on Clarke (8), overall \ntolerance can be divided into two components, tolerance of the \nparasite and tolerance of disease. Tolerance of the parasite is the \nrelationship between the presence of the parasite and disease, \nwhere disease is strictly defined as \u201cthe malfunctioning of host \ncells and tissues resulting from continuous irritation by a patho-\ngenic agent\u2026\u201d (1). As such, tolerance of the parasite is a function \nof both the capacity of the pathogen to damage host functions \n(which we refer to here as its pathogenicity) and the ability of the \nhost to buffer such damage. With disease defined as above, toler-\nance of disease is the relationship between host growth or fitness \nand the malfunctioning of its normal processes resulting from in-\nfection. Clearly, the host malfunction that defines disease could \nbe measured at a range of scales of organization but, at least for \nthe disruption of whole plant processes such as total carbon \nfixation, tolerance of disease may be a function of the host\u2019s over-\nall response to stress rather than specific to particular host\u2013para-\nsite interactions (7). For example, the mechanisms that buffer host \nfitness from loss of photosynthate may be the same whatever the \ncause of that loss. However, evidence from interactions between \nplants and foliar herbivores shows that host responses to defolia-\ntion can be specific to the herbivore or spatial pattern of damage \n(10,15,18). By analogy, there may be elements of specificity in \ntolerance of disease. \nThe question of specificity in the expression of tolerance to \npathogen attack remains unresolved. Models of host\u2013parasite co-\nevolution describe tolerance as the product of coevolution be-\ntween host and pathogen resulting in the production of an evolu-\ntionary stable state (27). The coevolutionary hypothesis predicts \nspecificity in tolerance and that tolerance would be more pro-\nnounced between hosts and native pathogens than between hosts \nand introduced pathogens. This prediction is consistent with the \nhigh degree of tolerance frequently reported between hosts and \nnative pathogens (27,28) and, conversely, the severe damage often \nassociated with some introduced pathogens (4,11,21). However, \nto our knowledge, this prediction has never been empirically \ntested and little is known about the mechanisms that would \nunderlie such differences. \nWe tested the hypothesis that there is greater overall tolerance \nin the interaction between a host and a native pathogen than with \nan alien pathogen using the annual composite Senecio vulgaris. In \nEurope, S. vulgaris is attacked by both the native rust fungus \nColeosporium tussilaginis and Puccinia lagenophorae, an intro-\nduced rust first recorded in the UK in the 1960s (35). Both these \npathogens are nonsystemic foliar rust fungi and they provide a \nrare opportunity to quantify and compare tolerance of a noncrop \nCorrespondence author: N. D. Paul; E-mail address: n.paul@lancaster.ac.uk \nDOI: 10.1094 \/ PHYTO-96-0718 \n\u00a9 2006 The American Phytopathological Society \nVol. 96, No. 7, 2006 719 \nhost to infection by similar native and alien pathogens. Specifi-\ncally, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) that overall toler-\nance (i.e., maintenance of fitness in relation to severity of infec-\ntion) is greater in the interaction of S. vulgaris with C. tussilaginis \nthan with P. lagenophorae, and (ii) given that tolerance of disease \nmay be a function of the host\u2019s overall stress responses (described \nabove), that greater overall tolerance to C. tussilaginis is the result \nof tolerance of the parasite rather than tolerance of disease. \nSome previous studies of tolerance in plant\u2013pathogen inter-\nactions have focused on attempts to compare plant response at \nidentical levels of infection, which are difficult to attain (8,29). \nRecent studies of tolerance to herbivory provide an experimental \napproach, the quantification of reaction norms, that addresses the \nperceived difficulty that tolerance of pathogen attack needs to \ncompare responses at identical levels of infection. As described \nby Stowe et al. (32), the reaction norm approach requires that \nrelative plant fitness or yield be measured against a gradient of \ndisease or damage allowing tolerance to be expressed per unit of \ninfection or disease. Tolerance can then be quantified by the linear \nfunction Y = a + bX, where Y = response (e.g., relative fitness, \nyield, or biomass), X = infection or damage level, a = fitness in \nthe absence of damage, and b = the slope of the reaction norm \nwhich quantifies yield loss per unit level of disease or damage. \nThe slope (b) is thus a measure of tolerance; the less tolerant a \nspecies or genotype, the more negative the reaction norm. \nThe reaction norm approach has parallels in recent analyses of \ndisease tolerance as the slope of the relationship between crop \nresponse and integrated measures of infection such as area under \ndisease progress curve (AUDPC) (22). Similarly, the reaction \nnorm for leaf photosynthesis is analogous to the mechanistic \nmodel of Bastiaans (6) for the relationship between visible patho-\ngen infection and the area of photosynthetic inhibition, described \nas the \u201cvirtual lesion.\u201d We use the reaction norm in all our analy-\nses because it can be applied to all elements of tolerance. In the \nexperiments reported here, overall tolerance was calculated by the \nreaction norm between infection severity and whole plant dry \nweight and reproduction. Tolerance to infection was quantified by \nthe reaction norm between infection severity and carbon fixation, \nwhich was chosen as a key measure of the physiological malfunc-\ntion (i.e., disease) caused by rust infection. Tolerance of disease \nwas quantified by the reaction norm between the reduction in \ncarbon fixation and the total reproductive dry weight and whole \nplant dry weight of the host. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nGrowth and physiological responses of S. vulgaris to infection \nby either C. tussilaginis or P. lagenophorae were measured in \nthree repeated experiments (referred to here as experiments 1, 2, \nand 3), which were conducted under identical experimental condi-\ntions and in immediate succession. \nPlant cultivation. Seeds of nonradiate S. vulgaris, which is \nconsidered very largely self-fertilized (16), were collected from \nstock plants grown from the seed of a single capitulum, previ-\nously collected from a wild plant from Lancaster University \ncampus, Lancaster, UK (23). After collection, seeds were stored \nin the refrigerator at 4\u00b0C for at least 2 weeks to break dormancy \nand then sown into seed trays containing Levington M3 compost \n(Fisons, UK). Trays were well watered, covered with polythene, \nand germinated in a controlled environment room at 16 \u00b1 2\u00b0C \nwith a photosynthetic photon flux density of 300 \u00b5mol m\u20132 s\u20131 for \na 16-h photoperiod. Approximately 1 week after germination, \nwhen the seedlings had produced one true leaf, seedlings of uni-\nform size were transplanted to 9 cm pots containing Levington \nM3 potting compost and maintained under the same conditions as \nduring germination. Plants were watered as required. \nInoculation. Plants were inoculated with either C. tussilaginis \nor P. lagenophorae 2 weeks following transplantation into pots. \nAeciospores of P. lagenophorae or urediospores of C. tussilaginis \nwere collected from stock plants with a miniature cyclone spore \ncollector. Stock plants had previously been infected with spores \nof each pathogen collected from single sporulating pustules from \nnatural field infections of S. vulgaris collected in Lancaster, UK. \nImmediately after collection, spores were suspended in distilled \nwater and then diluted to produce a range of three suspension \nconcentrations that preliminary studies had shown to produce a \nwide range of infection densities (12). These concentrations were \n0.5 mg ml\u20131 (low), 3 mg ml\u20131 (medium), and 7 mg ml\u20131 (high). A \ncontrol treatment of pure water was also used giving four treat-\nments total. Twenty-five plants per treatment were inoculated by \nevenly spreading the spore suspensions onto all available leaf area \nwith a camel-hair paintbrush. Plants were then misted with dis-\ntilled water, enclosed in polythene bags, and placed in darkness \nfor 24 h after which they were returned to the controlled environ-\nment room. New growth without visible rust infection was inocu-\nlated on all plants 10 and 20 days after the initial inoculation, \nusing the same method described above. \nQuantification of rust infection. The appropriate measure of \ninfection in studying tolerance has been much discussed (8). In \nour view, what defines tolerance, at least from the perspective of \ncoevolution or epidemiology, is that parasite fitness is unaffected \nwhile host fitness or yield is buffered from the effects of parasite \nattack. In these terms, the ideal measure of the parasite is its life-\ntime fitness, but since this is rarely achievable in practice, we \nused sporulating area as an estimate of parasite fitness for these \nrusts. Sporulating area was measured at weekly intervals during  \n5 weeks following inoculation. Images of all infected leaf tissue \nwere captured digitally and analyzed using Image Pro-Plus ver-\nsion 4.5 (Media Cybernetics UK, Wokingham, UK). Image analy-\nsis precisely determined percent pathogen cover by allowing \nsporulating pustule area to be manually selected and then measured \nas a proportion of the healthy green leaf area, thereby enabling \ncalculation of percent whole plant infection and percent healthy \nleaf area for each individual at each harvest. \nSince we relate infection to host growth and reproduction over \nits whole development, we used AUDPC as a measure of inte-\ngrated lifetime infection. AUDPC is a convenient and commonly \nused measure of infection integrated over the life of a crop (9), \nand was calculated for the whole experiment by trapezoidal inte-\ngration of weekly measurements of rust infection using the \nfollowing formula: \n[ ] )\/(2\/)(AUDPC 11\n1\n1 ii\nn\ni\nii ttXX \u2212+= +\n\u2212\n= +\n\u2211  \nwhere Xi is the percent leaf area with sporulating rust (measured \nas above), n is the number of assessments, and (ti+1 \u2013 ti) is the \ninterval between harvests (constant at 1 week), giving units of \npercent infection weeks. \nGrowth analysis. Five replicate plants per treatment were \nharvested 1 day prior to the first inoculation and then weekly for  \n5 weeks following inoculation. Plants were divided into their con-\nstituent organs of leaves, stems, roots, and reproductive tissues. \nReproductive tissues were further divided into yellow capitula \n(those with florets and stamens exposed) and mature capitula \n(those with seed set and matured). Floret production is well cor-\nrelated with mature seed production (24). Leaves were divided \ninto infected (those with any visible signs of infection) and non-\ninfected leaves, and their area was measured with a leaf area \nmeter (model 3100, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Roots were recovered \nfrom the pots and separated from the soil by washing with water. \nAll plant material was placed in a drying oven at 80\u00b0C until it \nreached constant mass, and then dry mass for each tissue type was \nrecorded. In experiment 2 only, five seed bearing capitula per \nplant were collected at the final harvest, and the number and mass \nof these seeds were measured. From these data, 100 seed mass for \neach individual was calculated, and total seed number produced \n720 PHYTOPATHOLOGY \nwas estimated by multiplying the average number of seed per \ncapitulum by the total number of mature capitula on the plant. After \ncapitula have matured and the seed dispersed, the mature capitula \nremain on the plant. Hence, the number recorded at the final \nharvest is an accurate measure of the total number of capitula that \nhave reached maturity and dispersed seed up until that point. \nGas exchange. As noted above, whole plant carbon fixation \nwas chosen as an integrated measure of the physiological mal-\nfunction (i.e., disease) caused by rust infection. Direct measure-\nments of whole plant carbon fixation have the advantages of \nintegrating responses across all leaves, uninfected or asympto-\nmatic as well as infected, different leaf ages, etc. Such measure-\nments, while key to understanding whole plant response, clearly \ndo not provide any understanding of local responses to infection \nin specific leaves. Thus, we also measured leaf scale photosyn-\nthesis in both infected leaves, and in asymptomatic leaves on \ninfected plants. \nWhole plant CO2 and H2O exchanges were measured in all \nplants prior to the weekly destructive harvest detailed above. The \nwhole shoot system was enclosed within a 20-liter transparent \nPerspex box that enabled pots and roots to be excluded from the \nchamber, and gas exchanges were measured with a CIRAS 1 in-\nfrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (PP Systems Ltd., Hitchin, UK). Am-\nbient air from outside the laboratory was used as stable reference \nsupply and air was mixed within the cuvette with a fan. Measure-\nments were made under a 400W metal halide lamp giving a \nphotosynthetic photon flux density of 250 \u00b5mol m\u20132 s\u20131. Each \nplant was placed in the measurement chamber and allowed to \nequilibrate for 5 min, gas exchange was measured every 30 s for \n10 min, and the mean of these 20 measurements was determined. \nPlants were blocked by treatment to eliminate any effects of time \nof day. Whole plant transpiration and photosynthesis were initially \nrecorded as mmol H2O s\u20131 plant\u20131 and \u00b5mol CO2 s\u20131 plant\u20131, re-\nspectively. After leaf area was determined, these values were ex-\npressed as mmol H2O m\u20132 s\u20131 and \u00b5mol CO2 m\u20132 s\u20131 to give mean \ncanopy gas exchange averaged per square meter of leaf area per \nsecond. This was converted to a daily rate by multiplication by \n60, then by 60 again to give gas exchange per hour, and then by \nthe 16-h photoperiod to give an estimation of moles of gas ex-\nchanged per day. Multiplication by 7 enabled estimation of total \nmoles of H2O transpired per square meter and total moles of CO2 \nfixed per square meter per individual per week based on the \nassumption that the rates of gas exchange measured were both \nconstant and indicative of that over the entire week. Cumulative \nmoles of H2O transpired and CO2 fixed for each individual at the \nfinal harvest were then estimated by calculating the sum of the \nweekly values. \nWhole plant gas exchange in darkness was measured for plants \nof both pathogen treatments in experiment 2. Exactly the same \nmethod of measurement was used as in the light, but plants were \nconfined to darkness for 3 h prior to measurement, and measure-\nment was undertaken with light excluded from the measurement \nchamber. \nIndividual leaf gas exchange was measured for both pathogens \nin experiments 2 and 3. The third fully expanded leaf on all plants \nwas marked prior to inoculation and these leaves were measured \nweekly using a CIRAS 1 IRGA (PP Systems). Gas exchange was \nmeasured at cuvette conditions of saturated light, 80% ambient \nhumidity, and 360 ppm of CO2. Leaves were placed in the cuvette, \nallowed to equilibrate for 5 min, and measured every 30 s for  \n5 min. The means of these measurements were determined. Leaf \ngas exchanges were measured in the same way in darkness. Plants \nwere placed in darkness 3 h prior to measurement, and then gas \nexchange was measured with light excluded from the leaf surface. \nLeaf gas exchanges were related to infection assessed weekly on \nthe measured leaves using the same method as whole plant \ninfection assessment. \nStatistical analysis. A three-way analysis of variance with ex-\nperiment, rust, and severity of infection as the main factors \nshowed no significant effect of experiment or its interactions. \nHence, data across the three experiments were pooled into a \nsingle data set for each pathogen, and then tolerance of S. vulgaris \nto each was measured using the reaction norm approach described \nearlier. This was done using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Soft-\nware, San Diego, CA), with which host growth and physiological \nresponses were regressed against infection severity measured as \nAUDPC. The slope of the relationships with each rust was taken \nas the measure of tolerance, and an F test of difference in the \nslopes was computed to determine whether the extent of tolerance \ndiffered significantly between pathogens. \nRESULTS \nInfection development and severity of the pathogens. For \nboth pathogens, infection significantly increased with spore con-\ncentration to produce a gradient of infection (Fig. 1). This was \n \nFig. 1. Foliar infection of Senecio vulgaris produced by treatment with spore suspensions of 0, 0.5, 3, and 7 mg ml\u20131 of A, Coleosporium tussilaginis and B,\nPuccinia lagenophorae. Data are means of 15 replicates and error bars indicate standard errors. The results of two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) are shown, \nwhere * and ** represent significant effects at P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. The results of post-hoc comparison for inoculation treatment are also shown. Treat-\nments that do not share the same letter are significantly different at P < 0.05. C, L, M, and H represent control, low, medium, and high spore densities, respectively\n(details are provide in the text). \nVol. 96, No. 7, 2006 721 \nevident both in terms of mean foliar infection (Fig. 1, P = 0.007 \nfor C. tussilaginis, P = 0.01 for P. lagenophorae) and in terms of \nintegrated cumulative infection measured as AUDPC. The range \nof AUDPC produced was almost identical for the two pathogens, \nranging from 0.17 to 55.9% infection weeks for C. tussilaginis \nand from 0.017 to 53.4% infection weeks for P. lagenophorae. \nAverage foliar infection was also very similar between pathogens, \nthe mean AUDPC across all treatments being 17.71 and 19.4% \ninfection weeks for C. tussilaginis and P. lagenophorae, re-\nspectively. \nOverall tolerance: relationship between rust infection and \nhost growth and fitness. There were significant linear relation-\nships between infection of both pathogens and various growth \nparameters of S. vulgaris. Increasing AUDPC resulted in reduced \nfinal whole plant dry weight with both pathogens (Fig. 2A, both  \nP < 0.001), but this effect was significantly greater with P. lageno-\nphorae, as the slope of the reaction norm was significantly (P < \n0.01) more negative (Fig. 2A). This difference was reflected in \nindividual vegetative tissue types: P. lagenophorae reduced root \ndry weight and stem dry weight by over twice that caused by \nequivalent levels of C. tussilaginis infection (F test for a differ-\nence in slopes for roots [P = 0.001] and stems [P < 0.001]; data \nnot shown). \nP. lagenophorae was also more deleterious to reproductive \ngrowth. Although there was a significant negative linear relation-\nship between final total reproductive dry weight and infection  \nfor both pathogens (Fig. 2B, both P < 0.001), the significant \ndifference in the slopes of these reaction norms (P = 0.001)  \nFig. 2. Effect of infection gradients of Coleosporium tussilaginis (\u2022) and Puccinia lagenophorae (N) on growth and fitness of Senecio vulgaris expressed as A,\nfinal whole plant dry weight, B, final reproductive dry weight, C, cumulative yellow capitulum dry weight, and D, total seed production. Infection gradients are \nexpressed as area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) in percent infection weeks. Linear regressions for C. tussilaginis infection (solid line) and P. lageno-\nphorae infection (bold dashed line) are shown with 95% confidence intervals represented by thin dashed lines. F tests of a difference in the slopes between each \npathogen for each figure gave the following P values: A, <0.01; B, <0.001; C, <0.001; and D, <0.01. \n722 PHYTOPATHOLOGY \n showed that, per unit AUDPC, P. lagenophorae was approxi-\nmately three times more damaging than C. tussilaginis. The more \nsevere effects of P. lagenophorae were even more apparent in \nother reproductive measures. There was a significant difference \nbetween the effects of the two pathogens on cumulative yellow \ncapitulum production (Fig. 2C, P < 0.001) and seed produc- \ntion (Fig. 2D, P < 0.001). C. tussilaginis had no significant effect \non either parameter (Fig. 2C, P = 0.27; Fig. 2D, P = 0.51) in \ncontrast to equivalent infection severities of P. lagenophorae \nwhich severely reduced both (Fig. 2C, P < 0.001; Fig. 2D, P < \n0.001). Effects of P. lagenophorae were so severe that maximum \ninfection resulted in a reduction of total cumulative yellow \ncapitulum dry weight of around 80%, and seed production was \nalmost eliminated. \nTolerance of the parasite: relationship between rust infec-\ntion and CO2 exchanges in S. vulgaris. At 2 weeks following \ninoculation (Fig. 3A), infection of C. tussilaginis caused no sig-\nnificant effect on mean canopy photosynthetic rate, whereas in-\nfection of P. lagenophorae caused a significant decrease. At 3 and \n4 weeks following inoculation (Fig. 3B and C), there were sig-\nnificant negative linear relationships between percent whole plant \ninfection and mean canopy photosynthetic rate for both rusts. \nHowever, the effect of P. lagenophorae was over twice as severe \nas that of C. tussilaginis, and this difference was highly signifi-\ncant at both 3 weeks and 4 weeks following inoculation (Fig. 3B, \nP < 0.001; Fig. 3C, P < 0.001). These more severe effects of  \nP. lagenophorae highlighted by the weekly measurements were \nreflected by calculated cumulative moles of CO2 fixed over the  \n5-week experimental period. Reaction norms for both pathogens \nshowed significant negative linear relationships between cumula-\ntive infection and cumulative carbon fixation (Fig. 4A, C. tussi-\nlaginis [P = 0.0006] and P. lagenophorae [P < 0.0001]), but per \nunit AUDPC, the effects of P. lagenophorae were around four \ntimes greater (Fig. 4A, P < 0.0001). Such effects were not ap-\nparent during darkness when neither pathogen had any significant \neffect on cumulative whole plant carbon exchange, indicated by \nthe nonsignificant reaction norms (Fig. 4B). \nOn a single leaf scale, P. lagenophorae was, again, more detri-\nmental to carbon fixation. At 2, 3, and 4 weeks following inocu-\nlation, both pathogens significantly reduced leaf scale CO2 fixation \n(Fig. 5A, C, and E, respectively) but consistently to a significantly \ngreater extent with equivalent severity of P. lagenophorae in-\nfection (Fig. 5A, C, and E, respectively, P = 0.045, P < 0.0001, \nand P = 0.001, respectively). At 2 weeks following inoculation, \nthe relative deleterious effect of P. lagenophorae was around \ntwice that of C. tussilaginis (Fig. 5A, P = 0.045); this increased to \nover three times after 3 weeks (Fig. 5C, P < 0.0001), and then to \nfour times more detrimental at 4 weeks following inoculation \n(Fig. 5E, P = 0.001). In darkness, differences between the effects \nof the pathogens were less evident. Although C. tussilaginis \ncaused an initially greater effect on dark respiration at 2 weeks \nfollowing inoculation (Fig. 5B, P < 0.0001), this difference was \ntransient and disappeared at 3 weeks (Fig. 5D, P = 0.31) and  \n4 weeks (Fig. 5F, P = 0.43) after inoculation when both caused \nequivalent increases in dark respiration. \nTolerance of disease: relationship between reduced carbon \nfixation and host growth or fitness. Pathogen-driven reduc- \ntions in integrated mean canopy carbon fixation were signifi- \ncantly negatively related to whole plant dry weight (Fig. 6A,  \nC. tussilaginis [P = 0.019] and P. lagenophorae [P < 0.001])  \nand total reproductive dry weight (Fig. 6B, C. tussilaginis [P = \n0.001] and P. lagenophorae [P < 0.001]). There was a tendency \nfor the slopes of the reactions norms to be steeper for P. lageno-\nphorae than for C. tussilaginis but the differences were not sig-\nnificant for either whole plant dry weight (Fig. 6A, P = 0.43) or \nfinal reproductive dry weight (Fig. 6B, P = 0.1). Thus, there  \nwere no significant differences in tolerance to disease in the two \nsystems. \n \nFig. 3. Effect on infection gradients of Coleosporium tussilaginis (\u2022) and \nPuccinia lagenophorae (N) on mean canopy carbon fixation rate (\u00b5mole CO2\nm\u20132 s\u20131) of Senecio vulgaris at A, 2 weeks, B, 3 weeks, and C, 4 weeks after \ninoculation. Linear regressions for C. tussilaginis infection (solid line) and\nP. lagenophorae infection (bold dashed line) are shown with 5% confidence\nintervals represented by thin dashed lines. F tests of a difference in the slopes\nbetween each pathogen for each figure gave the following P values: A, 0.23;\nB, <0.001; and C, <0.001. \nVol. 96, No. 7, 2006 723 \nDISCUSSION \nThe reaction norm approach provided a convenient method of \nevaluating and comparing tolerance by quantification of host \nresponses to a gradient of infection of each pathogen, an approach \nthat negated the need for the production of identical infection \nseverities, which is extremely difficult in practice (8). Instead, \nsimilar gradients of infection were achieved by different inoculum \nloads. The range of infection was comparable for the two patho-\ngens, as measured by AUDPC, which is extensively used as a \nmeasure of integrated infection (13). Regression of whole plant \ndry weight and total reproductive dry weight against these infec-\ntion gradients produced significantly more negative reaction \nnorms with infection of P. lagenophorae than with C. tussilaginis. \nThe negative effect of P. lagenophorae was twice as great with \nregard to whole plant dry weight, and three times greater on total \nreproductive dry weight. It is clear that S. vulgaris is more toler-\nant of infection by C. tussilaginis than by P. lagenophorae. \nThe mechanisms by which this difference in overall tolerance \nwas produced were dissected by quantification of its components, \ntolerance of the parasite and tolerance of disease. Tolerance of the \nparasite was measured by relating infection severity to the degree \nof disease produced, here quantified as the percent reduction in \nintegrated canopy photosynthesis (i.e., total moles of CO2 fixed \nper unit leaf area over the whole life of the plant). It has been well \nestablished that infection of biotrophic pathogens generally re-\nsults in the inhibition of photosynthesis and increased dark respi-\nration (5). However, unlike the majority of studies which have \nshown this in only single leaves (2,29), it was shown here that \ninfection by both pathogens caused significant decreases in \nphotosynthesis on a whole plant scale. P. lagenophorae caused \ndecreases in whole plant photosynthetic rate per unit infection up \nto four times greater than those caused by C. tussilaginis. There is \nsignificantly greater tolerance of the parasite in the interaction \nbetween S. vulgaris and C. tussilaginis than that with P. lageno-\nphorae. This can be restated as infection by P. lagenophorae \ncauses greater disease, defined as the physiological malfunction \nevident in reduced carbon fixation, than infection by C. tussi-\nlaginis. It has been shown in other systems that plants can com-\npensate for reduced CO2 fixation in infected tissues by increased \nphotosynthesis either in healthy parts of infected leaves (30,31) or \nin uninfected leaves (20,25,26). Leaf measurements of uninfected \nleaves on infected plants revealed that photosynthetic changes in \nhealthy leaves were complex and varied with leaf age and the \nduration of infection (12), but evidence for compensatory photo-\nsynthesis in uninfected leaves was confined to plants infected \nwith P. lagenophorae. For example, 4 weeks after infection, \nphotosynthetic rates in uninfected leaves were 4.49 \u00b1 0.51 \u00b5mol \nCO2 m\u20132 s\u20131 in control plants, 4.30 \u00b1 0.70 \u00b5mol CO2 m\u20132 s\u20131 in \nplants infected with C. tussilaginis (P > 0.05), and 6.86 \u00b1  \n0.62 \u00b5mol CO2 m\u20132 s\u20131 in plants infected with P. lagenophorae  \n(P < 0.05 compared with controls). This is consistent with previ-\nous reports of compensatory photosynthesis in plants infected \nwith P. lagenophorae (23). Measurement of infected leaves \nshowed that despite heavy infection with C. tussilaginis, where up \nto 60% of the leaf was visibly infected, photosynthesis was \nmaintained at over 50% of the control rate. In contrast, similar or \nsmaller infection with P. lagenophorae caused a complete loss of \nnet carbon fixation. Therefore, it was maintenance of photosyn-\nthesis in infected leaves, and not compensatory photosynthesis in \nuninfected leaves, that minimized disease expression and con-\nferred high tolerance of the parasite in the S. vulgaris\u2013C. tus-\nsilaginis interaction. \nAlthough the reaction norms between disease (measured as \nreduced CO2 fixation) and whole plant and total reproductive dry \nweight tended to be more negative for P. lagenophorae than for  \nC. tussilaginis, these differences were not statistically significant \n(Fig. 6). Thus, there is no evidence for differences in tolerance of \ndisease between the two pathosystems. Therefore, the greater \noverall tolerance observed in the S. vulgaris\u2013C. tussilaginis inter-\naction was due to the greater tolerance of the parasite, not greater \ntolerance of disease. As discussed, the high tolerance of the para-\nsite was due to the ability of S. vulgaris to maintain photosyn-\nthesis in leaves heavily infected with C. tussilaginis. The basis of  \nFig. 4. Effect on infection gradients of Coleosporium tussilaginis (\u2022) and \nPuccinia lagenophorae (N) on calculated integrated carbon exchange of Senecio\nvulgaris expressed as A, total moles of CO2 fixed during light, and B, total \nmoles of CO2 respired during darkness. Infection gradients are expressed as \narea under disease progress curve (AUDPC) in percent infection weeks. \nLinear regressions for C. tussilaginis infection (solid line) and P. lageno-\nphorae infection (bold dashed line) are shown with 5% confidence intervals \nrepresented by thin dashed lines. F tests of a difference in the slopes between\neach pathogen for each figure gave the following P values: A, <0.001 and B,\n0.48. Since there was no significant difference between the effects of each rust\non respiration, data have been pooled to give a single reaction norm. \n724 PHYTOPATHOLOGY \n  \n \nFig. 5. Effect on leaf infection severity of Coleosporium tussilaginis (\u2022) and Puccinia lagenophorae (N) on single leaf carbon exchange of Senecio vulgaris in light \n(A, C, and E) and darkness (B, D, and F) at A and B, 2 weeks following inoculation, C and D, 3 weeks following inoculation, and E and F, 4 weeks following \ninoculation. Linear regressions for C. tussilaginis infection (solid line) and P. lagenophorae infection (bold dashed line) are shown with 5% confidence intervals\nrepresented by thin dashed lines. F tests of a difference in the slopes between each pathogen for each figure gave the following P values: A, 0.045; B, <0.001;\nC, <0.001; D, 0.31; E, 0.001; and F, 0.43. Where there is no significant difference between the rusts, data sets have been pooled to give a single reaction norm. \nVol. 96, No. 7, 2006 725 \nthis greater tolerance of the parasite in terms of leaf scale photo-\nsynthesis is currently being investigated. However, it is unlikely to \nbe due simply to greater fungal respiration in P. lagenophorae, \nsince this would have been reflected in leaf respiration rates (14), \nand we found no such difference between the two pathogens (Fig. \n5). Secondly, microscopic examination of stained leaves sug-\ngested that there was no gross difference in the relationship be-\ntween visible sporulation and the area of leaf colonized by fungi \n(12). It is more likely that the greater effect of P. lagenophorae is \na function of mechanisms not directly associated with pathogen \ngrowth or metabolism, a finding analogous with a recent investi-\ngation into the effects of herbivores on leaf gas exchange (3). As \nnoted above, the virtual lesion model (6) offers an alternative \napproach to analyzing our leaf photosynthesis data, with the ratio \nof the area of the virtual lesion to the visible lesion (the parameter \nbeta in Bastiaans\u2019 [6] model) being broadly comparable with the \nslope of the reaction norm. Analysis of our data using the virtual \nlesion model gave values for beta for P. lagenophorae that were \n5- to 30-fold higher than for C. tussilaginis (S. J. Inglese and  \nN. D. Paul, unpublished data), confirming the far greater effects \nof P. lagenophorae apparent in the reaction norm analysis. Cer-\ntainly, our results suggest that pathogen attributes are an impor-\ntant determinant in the expression of tolerance in host pathogen \nassociations. This observation is consistent with studies in herbi-\nvory which have shown that host responses to equivalent levels of \nherbivore-induced damage can be specific to the herbivore or \npattern of damage (10,15,18). \nThese data confirm our hypothesis that overall tolerance is \ngreater in the interaction of S. vulgaris with C. tussilaginis than \nwith P. lagenophorae, and demonstrate that this difference is a \nfunction of tolerance of the parasite not tolerance of disease. The \nmechanisms by which photosynthesis in S. vulgaris is better \nbuffered against infection by C. tussilaginis than P. lagenophorae \nremain unknown, but if we take pathogenicity as being the ability \nof a parasite to interfere with one or more of the essential func-\ntions of the plant, thereby causing disease (1), then P. lagenophorae \nhas greater pathogenicity than C. tussilaginis. Clearly, there may \nbe inherent differences between these two rusts that are unrelated \nto their coevolutionary history with S. vulgaris, but these data are \nat least consistent with the broader hypothesis that tolerance is \ncoevolved between host and pathogen. Testing this hypothesis is \nlimited partly because tolerance remains poorly understood, even \nwith crop pathogens, and partly because pathosystems that allow \ndirect comparison of alien and native pathogens on noncrop hosts \nare rare. One source of analogous interactions may come from \nwild plants introduced outside their native range. In such systems, \nunderstanding of tolerance would be directly relevant to the \nenemy escape hypothesis that predicts that invasiveness is a func-\ntion of evasion of parasites from their native range (17,34), and \nmay also be pertinent to the development of biological control \nstrategies for alien weeds (19). \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe thank the Natural Environment Research Council for a Ph.D. \nstudentship awarded to S.
