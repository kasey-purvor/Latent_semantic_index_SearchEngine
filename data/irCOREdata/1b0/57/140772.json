April 2008 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nIntroduction  \nMolecular recognition is fundamental to the function of biological systems and has great practical \nimportance in advancing science and technology. Among the various existing approaches to produce \nbiomimetic systems for molecular recognition, \u2018molecular imprinting\u2019 has delivered several distinct \nadvantages and broad applications [1]. In general terms, molecular imprinting can be described as the \nformation of a polymer network with specific recognition and binding sites that are complementary to a \ntemplate, which could be either a biomolecule or a synthetic compound. During this formation, the \nfunctional monomers are polymerised in the presence of a template, which is subsequently removed by \nwashing and\/or extraction after the polymerisation. Thus, the re-binding template could be recognised \nby the polymer. The product of molecular imprinting is called a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) \n(see Figure 1). Generally, there are three approaches to molecular imprinting, and these can be \ndistinguished in terms of the interaction between the template molecule and the functional monomer. \nThey are covalent molecular imprinting, non-covalent molecular imprinting and metal-coordinating \nmolecular imprinting.  \n \n(1) \n(2) \n+ \nRemoval \n(3) \nRebinding \n \nFig. 1 Molecular imprinting: (a) Formation of a pre-polymerisable complex with template (yellow) and \nfunctional monomers (red, green and brown) by interactions (non-covalent, covalent and\/or metal \ncoordination interactions) that occur between complementary functionalities in the template molecule \nand functional monomer units. (b) Polymerisation with excess cross-linking agent to produce the MIP \n(grey); (c) Template (yellow) removal by washing and\/or extraction, which leaves specific recognition \nsites that are complementary to the templates in terms of size, shape and chemical functionality \norientations, thus enabling subsequent recognition of the template during the rebinding process. \n \nMIPs are now well known as synthetic polymeric receptors or robust artificial antibodies \n(\u2018plastibodies\u2019) and have attracted considerable attention from the scientific and industrial communities \nowing to their inherent simplicity, reusability, robust polymer network and cost-effectiveness [1,2]. In \nthe past five years, a large number of publications have reported imprinting of relatively small \nmolecules such as sugars, steroids, pesticides, certain drugs and amino acid derivatives. This \ndemonstrates that MIPs are capable of highly specific recognition of templates and can be used in \npreparative and analytical separations, solid-phase extractions, chemical sensors, enzyme-like \ncatalysts, drug delivery and library screening tools, etc [3\u20137]. By contrast, however, the technology for \nlarge-molecule imprinting, particularly macromolecular imprinting, remains underdeveloped.  \nA macromolecule, such as a polymer or protein, consists of many smaller structural units covalently \nlinked together [8]. Interest and demand for macromolecular recognition is continually growing to \nfurther exploit natural systems for the control of biological form and function, particularly for \nbiomedical and biodiagnostic applications. In a conventional MIP, the small template molecule is able \nto move freely (i.e. to reach or leave) to the complementary binding sites in the MIP matrix. However, it \n 2\nGe, Y, Turner, APF; Too large to fit? Recent developments in macromolecular imprinting, Trends in Biotechnology, vol. 26, no. 4, pp218-224.

Furthermore, the increased structural complexity and large size of a macromolecule leads to \nmore non-specific and heterogeneous binding sites, and as a result the MIPs display poor recognition \nbehaviour. Additionally, owing to the complex properties of some biomacromolecules, such as proteins \nand cells, the conditions of biomacromolecular imprinting need to be close to their natural environment \nto ensure that their conformational integrities and binding activities are maintained.  \n \nProtein imprinting is the most intensively studied area of macromoleculular imprinting, and work \nup\nBiomacromolecular imprinting  \nost important biomacromolecules, proteins have been extensively investigated as \nin imprinting can generally be classified into three categories: bulk imprinting, \nsu\nBulk imprinting:\n to 2005 has been extensively reviewed [9\u201311]. This review therefore focuses on the most recent \ndevelopments using biological templates, including proteins and other biomacromolecules, and in \nparticular we reveal the emerging area of synthetic macrotemplates, such as dendrimers and \nhyperbranched polymers.  \n \nProtein imprinting  \nAs one of the m\nimprint templates since molecular imprinting technology was established more than 35 years ago [9\u2013\n11], but progress has been slow. Unsurprisingly, the bottleneck for this technology is the natural \nproperties of proteins. Proteins are biomacromolecules with molecular weights ranging from 6000 Da to \nseveral million Da. This large size hinders the protein from both reaching and leaving artificial binding \nsites. There are also a large number of potential binding sites and functional groups on the surface of \nproteins, and this complexity increases the probability that non-specific interactions will occur between \nproteins and MIPs, leading to poor selectivity and cross reactivity. More importantly, proteins are often \nincompatible with the organic solvents used in the synthesis of most MIPs. The use of an aqueous \nsolution for the molecular imprinting process greatly restricts the choice of reactive functional \nmonomers and cross-linkers. Moreover, it has been pointed out that water could compete for and \npotentially disrupt any hydrogen bonds between the template and the functional monomers [12]. Given \nthat hydrogen bonds play a significant role in non-covalent molecular imprinting, which is the most \nemployed and practical approach, water is far from the ideal solvent. In addition to being incompatible \nwith solvents, proteins are sensitive to temperature, pH and ionic strength, extremes of which can \nresult in denaturation, conformational changes or aggregation. All the above factors, together with the \nhigh costs of synthesizing some pure proteins, make the route to effective and practical protein \nimprinting tortuous.  \nApproaches to prote\nrface imprinting and epitope imprinting, depending on the imprinted part or fragment of protein \ntemplate (i.e. whole protein, partial protein or a small epitope part of protein) (see Box 1 and Table 1).  \n \n The protein template is wholly imprinted in the bulk of the polymer matrix, and is \nrecognised and bound as a whole molecule by functional monomers. \nSurface imprinting: The protein template is partially imprinted in the bulk of polymer matrix, and \nthe recognition and binding sites are situated at or close to the surface of MIP. \nEpitope imprinting: Only a small epitope part of protein is imprinted as the template, but the \nresulting MIP is able to recognise the whole protein. \n \nBox 1.

Selected examples of protein imprinting by three main approaches \n \nBulk imprinting. The most straightforward approach for protein imprinting is bulk imprinting. The \ndvantage of this approach is tha at the whole protein can be removed through either extraction or \nwashing and is then able to rebind into the three-dimensional cavity within the MIP. Owing to the \nlarge size of proteins, controlling the size and number of pores that are generated during the synthesis \nand spread onto the MIP surface, together with the density of MIP network, is essential for effective \nMIP design and synthesis.  \nPolyacrylamides and their derivatives are among the most extensively used polymeric materials for \nbulk imprinting of proteins. Recent examples include haemoglobin (Hb) [13], lysozyme [14\u201316] and \nbovine serum albumin (BSA) [15\u201319] imprinted polyacrylamides. However, these polymers usually \nsacrifice density of the polymer network to facilitate protein transfer. It is well known that low density \nMIPs are less stable [20], and therefore there is a demand for other more suitable matrix materials, \nsuch as hydrogels and sol-gels.  \nHydrogels are cross-linked, three-dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks that swell upon contact \nwith water but do not dissolve. They can change volume in response to external factors such as pH and \ntemperature, and this provides a means to control the polymer network. For instance, the capacity of \nBSA-imprinted calcium alginate to adsorb BSA was increased with additional hydroxyethyl cellulose, a \nhydrophilic cellulose derivative [21]. This system had a denser polymer network, decreased network \nmesh size and increased stability of cross-linkages. These factors were thought to make the big \ndifference by creating more imprinted moieties and thus making the interaction sites less movable and \nthe binding cavities more complementary to the original templates. The syntheses of Hb [22,23] and \nlysozyme [24] imprinted hydrogels have also been recently reported.  \nSol-gels are another group of advanced polymeric materials applied to bulk imprinting of proteins. \nThey are colloidal suspensions of silica particles that are gelled to form a solid. The advantages of water \ninvolvement and the mild condition (i.e. pH and ionic strength) in the sol-gel process have been \nexploited for BSA, Hb, myoglobin (Mb) and urease imprinting [25,26]. Recently, Tao et al. [27] \ndescribed an ovalbumin-imprinted polymer using xero-gel, a sol-gel-derived product that exhibits \nremarkable stability over time. In addition, its physicochemical properties can be tailored by using \ndifferent precursors or protocols. A novel strategy for the selective detection and quantification of \nproteins was established by installing a luminescently tagged molecule within the imprinted site and \nby monitoring the changes in luminescence upon binding of the analyte. The resulting polymer was \n 4\nGe, Y, Turner, APF; Too large to fit? Recent developments in macromolecular imprinting, Trends in Biotechnology, vol. 26, no. 4, pp218-224. April 2008 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nable to discriminate between the same proteins from different animal species (e.g. human and porcine \ninterleukin-1\u03b1).  \nAs discussed above, various approaches are available for the construction of macroporous polymer \nne\n to locate the imprinted sites at \nor\n who employed oriented \nim\ntworks that are used for bulk imprinting and which can entrap and release entire protein molecules. \nHowever, the decreased density of some polymers inevitably means that they loose recognition and \nbinding efficiency after a few rounds of regeneration. Also, the pore sizes and functional groups on the \npolymer surface can change over time under harsh conditions (e.g. high temperature and strong acid). \nFinally, larger proteins are more difficult to imprint, because it is more problematic to retain selectivity \nand adsorption with increasing template size. As a result, the alternative approaches of surface \nimprinting and epitope imprinting have attracted increasing interest.  \nSurface imprinting. A fundamental strategy of surface imprinting is\n close to the surface of the MIP, therefore enabling easy access to the target protein molecules. Thus, \nin comparison with bulk imprinting, the transfer of protein is much easier and the binding kinetic is \nless restricted although usually lower [28]. The selectivity can also decrease because only part of the \nprotein is bound and recognized. Some elegant examples are discussed below.  \nA novel surface imprinting approach was introduced by Yilmaz et al. [29],\nmobilisation of a theophylline template on porous silica beads before polymerisation. After \npolymerisation, the silica support was dissolved and removed along with the template. This differs from \nconventional surface imprinting, in which only the template is removed after the synthesis of MIP on a \nsolid support. In subsequent work, amino acids and peptides were also imprinted [30,31]. Inspired by \nthis elegant idea, Li et al. [32] recently developed a surface imprinted polymer nanowire for protein \nrecognition (see Figure 2). Binding and competitive rebinding studies suggested that the high \nspecificity and capacity of the imprinted nanowire was due to the cooperative and multivalent hydrogen \nbonds between the template and the nanowire. The large surface area of nanowires also resulted in \nhigh protein-binding capacity. Furthermore, given that nanowires disperse well in water, they could \ngreatly facilitate applications such as affinity chromatography and biosensing. In addition, Chou and \nco-workers [33] described a microcontact imprinting method for protein recognition. This approach \nadapted Yilmaz\u2019s idea [29] and, in addition, used a stamping technique. Several advantages were \ndemonstrated, such as rapid MIP synthesis, low amounts of monomers and solvent compatibility of the \ntemplate.  \n \n \nFigure 2.

Compared with \nimprinting using free Hb template, this imprinted silica-silane system proved to be superior in terms of \nselectivity for Hb over other proteins (e.g. transferin and chymotrpsinogen A).  \nIt is of particular note that a series of thin, protein-imprinted films or coat\nen applied to the surface of sensors, such as gold electrodes used in quartz crystal microbalances \n(QCMs) [35\u201338], and screen-printed platinum electrodes [38]. For example, Zhang et al. [35] reported a \nnovel method that combined sol-gel and self-assembly technology to prepare a thin film imprinted with \nhuman serum albumin (HSA) on a gold electrode in a QCM. The resulting sensor showed excellent \n 5\nGe, Y, Turner, APF; Too large to fit? Recent developments in macromolecular imprinting, Trends in Biotechnology, vol. 26, no. 4, pp218-224.

Rick and \nChou [38] used cyclic voltammetric deposition to provide more control of the protein imprinted \npolymerisation process on a screen-printed platinum support, resulting in enhanced reproducibility of \nthin polymer films with defined conductivity.  \nSurface imprinting results in the formation of specific cavities on the surface of the imprinted \npo\n is the part of a macromolecule that is recognized by the immune \nsy\nremarkable example of epitope imprinting using \npr\nlymer. These cavities have particular shapes or steric effects that are complementary to parts or \nfragments of the protein template. However, because of the complexity and conformational flexibility of \nproteins, the interactions between the protein template and the functional monomer are not as specific \nand efficient as desired. As a result, protein surface-imprinted polymers sometimes exhibit cross-\nreactivity, non-specific binding and low selectivity. Furthermore, their template capacity is lower than \nthat of protein bulk-imprinted polymers. Hence, an improved and efficient strategy termed \u2018epitope \nimprinting\u2019 appears to be a very promising way forward, combining the concepts of both surface \nimprinting and bulk imprinting.  \nEpitope imprinting. An epitope\nstem, specifically by antibodies, B cells or cytotoxic T-cells. Inspired by this rational, Rachkov and \nMinoura [39,40] created a new approach for protein imprinting by imprinting only a short peptide \nsequence that represents a small and exposed fragment of the whole protein [39,40]. The resulting \npolymer was able to recognize not only the small peptide template but also the entire protein. This \napproach was christened \u2018epitope imprinting\u2019.  \nRecently, Shea and co-workers [41] presented a \notein imprinted thin film. They used small peptides fragments of cytochrome c (cyt c) as epitopes to \nimprint the capture sites (see Figure 3). In comparison with non-imprinted film, the resulting film \nshowed a roughly seven-fold higher affinity and capacity for the target protein. The result of epitope \nimprinting of BSA showed a significantly high selectivity for BSA when the correct peptide was \nemployed as the epitope. It is of particular note that a very poor selectivity for BSA was observed when \na mutant peptide (only one amino acid had been mutated) was used as the epitope under the same \nconditions. Moreover, non-specific binding was reduced, owing to the low number of potential binding \nsites for non-target protein, and specific binding was enhanced by cooperative and multivalent \ninteractions, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.  \n \n 6\nGe, Y, Turner, APF; Too large to fit?

April 2008 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nAn unusual approach for the separation and recognition of cyt c (surface histidine-exposed protein) \nemployed L-histidine as an epitope template, which had metal-coordination interaction with the metal-\nchelating monomer N-methacryloyl-(L)-histidine-Cu2+ [46]. As previously discussed by Conrad II and \nShea [20], the metal coordination force enhanced the binding affinity and selectivity. The imprinted \nsystem was stable and reusable without considerable loss of template adsorption capacity after the \ntemplate was removed, but this system is only applicable for certain protein templates (e.g. Hb and Mb) \ncontaining exposed residues that can form a metal coordination bond with the monomer.  \nEpitope imprinting has several advantages. First, more specific and stronger interactions with a \nsmall part or fragment of the protein can minimise non-specific binding and improve affinity. Second, \norganic solvents can be employed for the polymerisation process, because small peptide templates are \nmore stable in these solvents. Finally, synthesizing the short peptides that serve as epitopes is \ninexpensive. However, modified and functionalised peptides such as phosphorylated peptides are \ndifficult to purify or synthesize.  \nOther biomacromolecular imprinting  \nIn addition to proteins, other biomacromolecules or even microorganisms have recently been used as \ntemplates for imprinting. A porous blend of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) and dextran in the presence \nof \u03b1-amylase as template resulted in a molecularly imprinted membrane that showed selective \nrecognition features for biomacromolecules such as pepsin, albumin and amyloglucosidase [47]. \nEscherichia coli-imprinted gel granules synthesized by bulk imprinting were able to distinguish \nbetween different types and strains of bacteria by using free-zone electrophoresis [48]. However, \nsurface imprinting is a more practical approach owing to the large dimensions of microorganisms, as \ndemonstrated by the successful surface imprinting of cells and viruses (e.g. yeast cell and tobacco \nmosaic virus) by Dickert et al. [49\u201351].  \nSynthetic macromolecular imprinting  \nIn biomacromolecular imprinting, several physical and chemical compromises need to be made in terms \nof solubility, stability and identification of functional groups, and it is usually difficult to synthesize the \nMIPs in an environment that reflects a biological environment. The complexity, inconsistency and \nexpense of some biomacromolecules also hinders its development. Consequently, synthetic \nmacromolecules, particularly those with biomimetic functionalities and defined functional groups such \nas dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers (HBPs), offer interesting alternative templates and \nsynthetic analogues to biomacromolecules.  \nDendrimer and hyperbranched polymer imprinting  \nDendrimers are well defined, three-dimensional and nanoscopic macromolecules constructed from an \ninterior core, with a regular array of branching units. They are able to mimic not only the size and \nshape of natural macromolecule such as proteins but also biological functions such as molecular \nrecognition of substrates, either in their interior or on the surface [52]. Therefore, they have been \nincreasingly used for a wide range of biological applications such as molecular imaging and drug \ndelivery [52\u201354]. Furthermore, some dendrimers can be easily degraded under certain conditions (e.g. \nhigh or low extremes of pH) and dissolved in a range of solvents, which considerably facilitates the \nprocess of template removal.  \nFollowing some preliminary studies using poly(propylene)imine dendrimer as a single-molecule \ntemplate for the casting of mesoporous cavities in silica sol-gels [55,56], a remarkably elegant \nimprinting approach, wherein a single template was dynamically imprinted in a single dendrimer, was \nrecently reported by Zimmerman et al. [57\u201359]. The significant advantages of this technology were as \nfollows: (i) nearly homogeneous binding sites; (ii) only one binding cavity per polymer molecule; (iii) \ncomplete template removal; and (iv) good solubility of the resulting material in common organic \nsolvents. However, technically this example does not constitute dendrimer imprinting, because the \nremovable template was not a dendrimer.  \nThe first genuine examples of dendrimer imprinting were presented by Sellergren and Hall*. In \naddition to dendrimer imprinting, they also introduced hyperbranched polymer (HBP) imprinting for \nthe first time*. Unlike well defined and monodispersed dendrimers, HBPs are polydispersed and have \ndefects in the form of built-in linear segments; but they are they are still highly branched dendritic \nmolecules. HBPs are promising and competitive materials owing to their relative ease of preparation \nand cost-effectiveness [60]. Various HBPs have been investigated and have proved competitive with \ndendrimers for biological applications such as device delivery [61] and as oxygen carriage [62]. In \ncommon with dendrimers, HBPs can be partially or completely decomposed under the right conditions \nand have good solubility in a range of solvents, facilitating temple removal.  \n \n 8\nGe, Y, Turner, APF; Too large to fit?

April 2008 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nIn Sellergren and Hall\u2019s patent application*, MIP was synthesized using either a dendrimer or HBP \nas the template with at least one functional monomer (e.g. carboxylic acid, boronate or urea functional \nmonomer) and through either bulk imprinting or surface imprinting. After the template was removed, \nthe resulting MIP was used for affinity-phase separation or sensing of relevant proteins, \npolynucleotides or polysaccharides, which have similar size, shape and functional groups to the \npolymeric template. Owing to the multifunctionality of the terminal groups on the surface of the \ndendrimer and HBP, the properties of the complementary domain of MIP can be modified and specially \ndesigned. For instance, when some small ligands such as peptides and oligosugars are attached to the \nsurface of a dendrimer or HBP template, additional imprinted sites are created, thus mimicking \nfunctionalised biomacromolecules (e.g. glycosylated Hb imprinting). Furthermore, combined with other \npore-forming species, such as silane-modified silica and porous silica, dendrimers and HBPs could be \neither used as templates to increase accessibility of MIP binding cavities or attached to porous \ndisposable solid supports for subsequent MIP synthesis by adapting Yilmaz\u2019s method [29].  \nIn conclusion, synthetic macromolecular imprinting using dendrimers and HBPs is a promising \napproach for a broad range of applications. An important advantage of this technology is that MIPs can \nbe synthesized and analysed in either non-aqueous or aqueous solutions without conformational change \nor loss of bioactivity of the templates, which is an obstacle to most types of biomacromolecular \nimprinting. In addition, this technique could facilitate a range of highly functionalised and reactive \nmacro-templates that are either not found in nature or difficult to obtain. It should be noted, however, \nthat the expense and laborious synthesis of dendrimers and the high polydispersity of HBPs might \nrestrict the widespread use of this technology.  \nConclusions and outlook  \nThe field of macromolecular imprinting has expanded rapidly in recent years, particularly owing to the \nconsiderable increase in demand for macromolecular detection, separation and analysis. There are \nmultifarious examples of successful molecular imprinting for relatively low molecular weight molecules, \nsuch as steroids and pesticides. In addition, large biomolecules such as proteins and cells have also \nbeen successfully imprinted. However, because of their natural limitations, conventional preparation \nand analysis of imprinted polymers has to be modified to accommodate the physical properties (e.g. \nsolubility, stability and conformation) of these biotemplates. Therefore, synthetic analogues, such as \ndendrimers and HBPs, could provide alternative and practical templates for future imprinting \napplications. Meanwhile, among the three general approaches for macromolecular imprinting, epitope \nimprinting seems be advantageous, owing to its desirable characteristics, such as increased specific \nrecognition and higher affinity. However, more investigations are required to further improve \nselectivity, stability, site accessibility and cost-effectiveness, especially in biomedical applications such \nas medical devices, diagnostics, drug delivery and biological assays. Excellent progress has been made, \nbut it might be some time before a generic and scaleable approach to imprint macromolecules will be \nachieved.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9\nGe, Y, Turner, APF; Too large to fit?
