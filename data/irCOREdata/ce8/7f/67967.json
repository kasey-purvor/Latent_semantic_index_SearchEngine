Several of the authors of this collection of papers presented at the international meeting \non the mechanical behaviour of materials have been working continuously in that field for several \ndecades. In contrast, in this instance we have an example of an author who, having some experience \nin nanoindentation and surface - mechanical research, now pursues interdisciplinary studies of \nnanoscale properties in a different field. \n   This paper discusses how a near-field version of infrared microspectroscopy, together with \nmultivariate data analysis points a way towards a new method for identifying biomarkers for use in \nbiomedical evaluation procedures. We also outline some details of a non-statistical method of \nclassification, employing fuzzy logic. \n  \nIntroduction  \n \n   In a wide range of situations ranging from polymer technology to biomedical studies, the samples \nto be characterised can be inhomogeneous, with structural detail at the sub-micrometer level. The \nresearcher often faces the task of chemically mapping the individual components or detecting subtle \nspatial variations in their molecular composition. Hence our interest in the microspectroscopical \nproperties of materials. We discuss two examples of recent work carried out in collaboration with \ncolleagues at the universities of Lancaster and East Anglia, who have employed combinations of \nscanning probe microscopy with infrared spectroscopy for chemical mapping by infrared \nmicrospectroscopy at sub-micron spatial resolution. Accordingly, this paper, as presented to a \nmeeting on the mechanical behaviour of materials, is in the nature of a non-specialist review.  \nBiomedical specialists will find that statements and claims made here are justified by reference to \npreviously published papers, as indicated in the text. \n \nNear-field spectroscopic characterization of biomaterials \n \n    Localised spectroscopic techniques. The first example is taken from the biomedical field, where \nthe motive was to identify biochemical markers that might serve as diagnostic fingerprints for \nidentifying rogue cells of human tissue. These markers would consist of certain features of \nvibrational spectra in the mid-infrared, enabling us to pick out molecular groups of interest. The \nexpectation was that any spectral deviations would point to the presence of biomolecular alterations \nwithin cells. If, for example, an automated procedure could thereby be found that might replace the \nvisual procedures involved in screening, in the UK, four million women per year for cervical \ncancer, there would in principle be good prospects of very significantly reducing the proportion of \nfalse negatives and false positives. Typically the proportion of suspicious cells in a sample may be \nless than 2%, and even existing semi-automated morphometric and related techniques designed to \naddress such issues have yet to prove themselves more cost-effective and reliable than conventional \nlabour-intensive approaches. \n   The task of obtaining and interpreting localised spectral data from individual cells or groups of \ncells, requiring the development of a combination of spectroscopy with scanning probe microscopy, \ninvolved expertise in several areas: near-field microscopy, evanescent thermal waves, the \nphotothermal effect, multivariate data analysis, spectroscopic analysis\u2026 a truly interdisciplinary \nundertaking. Infrared microspectroscopy has already reached the point at which appropriate \nmethods of analysis of the observed spectral patterns can reveal distinct spectral classes that \ncorrelate well with visual cytology [1]. The relevant part of the IR spectral region is generally taken \nto be 2-20 micrometers in wavelength. To date, most IR microspectroscopical studies have \nemployed some version of diffraction-limited microscopy, of which one type provides optical \nvisualisation plus IR spectroscopic data collection. The second (more recent and more advanced) \ntechnique using commercially available 2-D Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy imaging \nspectrometers with focal plane array (FPA) detection can produce images with pixels down to 5\uf0b45 \n\u00b5m in size with very good signal\/noise ratio. \n   On the other hand, near-field photothermal versions can perform localised spectroscopy and \nimaging with a spatial resolution that is not diffraction-limited, which means that they achieve \nhigher spatial resolution than is possible with conventional far-field optics [2]. These photothermal \ntechniques are based on the fact that an object that absorbs IR radiation heats up. In the technique \nknown as AFM-IR or photothermally-induced resonance (PTIR) [2-5], resonant motion of the probe \ninduced by rapid expansion of the object is detected. Alternatively the temperature change can be \ndetected directly by a temperature-sensitive probe, as PhotoThermal MicroSpectroscopy (PTMS) \n[6] which has advantages in a number of situations, in that often little or no sample preparation is \nrequired: as well as higher spatial resolution, it yields true absorption spectra even in situations \nwhere parts of the sample (for example, mitotic chromosomes) may be IR-opaque and thus give \nmisleading data in the conventional transmission mode. In PTMS, imaging uses a scanning probe \nmicroscope (SPM) and a source of radiation focused onto the point where the probe contacts the \nsurface of the sample. In each of the following examples, the relevant micro-anatomical \ncomponents for analysis were identified using either transmission electron microscopy, confocal \nmicroscopy, phase-contrast microscopy or synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy: where \nappropriate, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin before \nbeing checked retrospectively by a pathologist. \n    Photothermal microspectroscopy (PTMS). In our first example of near-field micro-\nspectroscopical measurements, PTMS was employed, using the same type of thermal probe as is \nused in scanning thermal microscopy. This imaging probe is a sub-miniature temperature sensor, \nwhich may be a thermocouple or a resistance thermometer. As with a standard AFM, the probe is \nincorporated into a cantilever structure, so that force feedback may be employed in the usual way, \nfor positioning and topographic imaging. The AFM is interfaced with an infrared spectrometer. A \nparticular region of the sample may first be chosen on the basis of the image obtained using the \nAFM imaging mode of operation. The IR beam is focused to a spot, whose diameter is not critical. \nThen when material at this location absorbs the electromagnetic radiation, heat is generated which \ndiffuses, giving rise to a decaying temperature profile. The thermal probe then detects the \nphotothermal response of this region of the sample. \n   In one variant of PTMS, the light source is a bench-top tuneable laser in the form of an optical \nparametric amplifier (OPA) [5], tuned successively to different wavelengths. Alternatively, in \ncommon with the great majority of IR spectroscopic techniques, PTMS frequently employs a \nconventional globar broadband (\u201cwhite\u201d) infrared source of radiation, giving a continuous spread of \nfrequencies. With this broadband technique, an interferometer with a moving mirror allows the \nsignal to be measured as a function of time (the \u201cinterferogram\u201d). The data are then converted to \nintensity as a function of frequency (i.e. the spectrum) by means of the Fourier-transform method. \nIn the conventional version, the measured signal is light intensity (e.g. transmitted or reflected). In \nbroadband PTMS, the modulation of the light intensity by the interferometer causes modulation of \nthe energy absorption by the sample. The diffusion of heat to the temperature sensor is thus \nmodulated at the same frequency as the light modulation. The same principle as in conventional \nFTIR spectroscopy is used, except that the raw interferogram is simply the temperature measured \nby the probe as a function of time: the Fourier transform conversion then proceeds as usual. \n   These techniques have been used to characterise adult (non-embryonic) stem cells, both from the \ncorneal epithelium and from the human gut. Identification of adult stem cell populations has proved \nvery difficult, since by their very nature they appear undifferentiated: no established reliable \nmarkers for this purpose exist that are applicable across different anatomical sites, and to-day, the \nlocations of many stem-cell populations in different tissues of the human body remain uncertain. \nCommonly there are three main types of cell: stem cells (SC), which can divide asymmetrically to \ngive rise to another stem cell and a second cell type designated as a transit-amplifying (TA) cell; \nsubsequent cell divisions of the TA cells will give rise to the third cell type given the designation \nterminally-differentiated (TD) cell (these are the functional cells of a specific tissue, though it must \nbe recognised that there may be more than one type of TA cell in a micro-anatomical component). \n \nData analysis issues \n \n    The \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d problem. Next we turn to the question of data analysis. In a \nparticular case we might, for instance, have two groups of tissue samples, with 50 samples in each \ngroup. Suppose that we wish to see whether the types of cell in the two groups differ significantly in \nthe secondary structure of intracellular proteins, or the degree of protein phosphorylation. We \nmeasure the 100 spectra, each with 1000 wavebands, but it is very unlikely that any one single \nwavenumber in a spectrum will respond only to a particular alteration in either of these two factors. \nIndeed, there could be less than 1% difference in the amplitudes of the spectral peaks, between the \nvarious samples! To attack this \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d problem, one way forward is to find some \nway of ignoring the similarities and picking out the variability (mathematically, the differences in \nvariance as derived from the correlation matrix of the data). This may be achieved by using \nchemometric methods involving multivariate data analysis [1], or alternatively non-statistical \nmethods such as artificial neural networks [7] or fuzzy logic [8]. \n    Principal component analysis. For example, in determining the observed variance pattern it \nwould almost certainly be misleading to regard the hundreds of wavebands in the spectrum as \nindependent variables. Methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) exploit the fact that \ninstead, the variation is typically determined by perhaps only 4 or 5 factors (\u201cprincipal \ncomponents\u201d). Each raw data spectrum presents data from a single sample, but of course involves \nall the wavenumber variables. With PCA, for each wavenumber variable we may tabulate, along a \nsingle axis, the value of that variable measured for each of the samples (Fig. 1). This gives us a \nsingle column vector.  \n                                \n     Figure 1: Example of a series of spectra, illustrating how principal components are derived \n(schematic) \n \nSoftware then uses matrix algebra to create a vector consisting of a linear combination of the many \nhundreds of these raw data vectors, calculated in such a way as to reveal maximal amounts of \nvariation, which plotting the original vectors fails to enable us to achieve. Each of these vectors is \ncalled a principal component (PC), and these PCs act as axes in multidimensional \u201chyperspace\u201d, \nreplacing the many hundreds of waveband variables (wavenumbers). The PCs appear in order, \nstarting with PC1 which reveals the biggest spread between objects. The so-called \u201cscore\u201d of each \nsample for a given PC is a measure of its contribution to the individual PC: plots of the scores of all \nthe samples reveal intersample relationships (groupings or clusterings). \n   PCA is just one of a multitude of multivariate data analysis methods, each of which may have \nadvantages according to the particular nature of the task. They are discussed in the review by Wang \nand Mizaikoff [1], and Fig. 12 of ref. [2] gives a chart that summarises the more popular of these. \n    Allocation of spectra from individual regions to different categories (clusters, groupings, \nclasses). Our preference is use PCA for preliminary data reduction and to process the output using \ndiscriminant analysis (LDA), which is a \u201csupervised\u201d method in that a priori classes derived from \nPCA or from prior knowledge are pre-allocated. The spectra from one of the studies of corneal cells \nare shown as a PCA-LDA scores plot in Fig. 2, and we see that this PCA-LDA procedure [9] can be \nan extremely powerful method of revealing clustering.                             \n         \n                               spectra                                                                               PCA-LDA scores plot    \nFigure 2: Identification of adult stem cell populations from the corneal epithelium. The PCA-LDA \nscores plot shows very clear separation of the different types of cell (O. Grude, A. Hammiche, H.M. \nPollock, A.J. Bentley, M.J. Walsh, F.L. Martin and N.J.  Fullwood, J. Microscopy Vol. 228, p. \n366, \u00a92007 Wiley-Blackwell, reproduced with permission). \n \n    Biomolecular features responsible for separation into classes? Just as a single raw data \nspectrum involves all the wavenumbers, the equivalent version of a PC vector, for plotting the \ncontribution of each wavenumber to the PC, is termed its loadings curve: it presents data from all \nthe samples, and plots the coefficients by which the original wavenumber variables must be \nmultiplied to obtain the PC concerned. Thus it may be regarded as a pseudo-spectrum, but \ndisplaying variation rather than raw data. Accordingly, we may compare the original spectra with \nthe loading curves of the PCs used, in order to identify the particular wavenumbers whose signal \namplitudes reveal significant variation between samples. Thus once any groupings (clusters) have \nappeared, these critical wavenumbers provide a way of revealing the biomolecular and\/or \nconformational changes that are associated with particular cell subpopulations, whether normal or \notherwise. \n   A limitation of this use of PCA loadings is that unless one of the PCs happens to pass through the \ncluster in question, the vital wavebands responsible for the observed clustering might be missed. \nThus, even more useful are the loading curves of individual \u201ccluster vectors\u201d or pseudo-PCs which, \nin a recent variation of this approach [9], may be plotted in hyperspace to pass though the medians \nof individual clusters of interest (Fig. 3). A weighted averaging algorithm then gives the required \nplot identifying the wavenumbers responsible. In the case of the corneal cells whose clustering is \nshown in Fig. 2, this method showed that the differences between the three cell types involved \nvariations in the spectral peak heights as follows: \n   C=O stretching vibrations of nucleic acids (1710-1700 cm\n-1\n); \n   C=N stretching in guanine (1590 cm\n-\n); \n   COO\n-\n symmetrical stretching vibrations of fatty acids and amino acids or C-H bend in amino acid \nresidues (1400 cm\n-1\n); \n   Phosphate activity (1200-1190 cm\n-1\n); \n   Sugar ring vibrations\n,\n and C-O and C-C stretch in DNA\n2\n (1000-950 cm\n-1\n) \n                              \nFigure 3: Scores plot with schematic representation of the loading curves (\u201cpseudospectra\u201d) of \nthree PCs, together with the resultant cluster vector constructed so as to pass though the median of \none of the three clusters. \n                                    \nFigure 4: Loading curves showing which molecular groups were found to be responsible for the \nsegregation into discrete data clusters of stem, TA and TD cells from crypts in the human large \nbowel: \n   protein conformation (1800 cm\n-1\n to 1480 cm\n-1\n) \n   asymmetric PO2\n-\n (1225 cm\n-1\n) and \uf06esPO2\n-\n (1080 cm\n-1\n)  \n   symmetric PO2- at 1080 cm\n-1\n(1490 cm\n-1\n to 1000 cm\n-1\n),\n \n \nwhich is consistent with reports of stem cell differentiation being triggered by chromatin \nmodifications. Each loading curve is the pseudospectrum of the hyperspace vector passing through \nthe median of the relevant scores cluster, and compares that type of cell\u2019s PTMS spectrum with the \naverage spectrum obtained from all classes. The samples were thin sections, obtained from paraffin-\nembedded tissue blocks and mounted on reflective glass slides (M.J. Walsh, T.G. Fellous, A. \nHammiche, W-R. Lin, N.J. Fullwood, O. Grude, F. Bahrami, J.M. Nicholson, M. Cotte, J. Susini, \nH.M. Pollock, M. Brittan, P.L. Martin-Hirsch, M.R. Alison and F.L. Martin, Stem Cells Vol. 26, p. \n108, \u00a9 AlphaMed Press 2008, reproduced with permission). \n \nIn Fig. 4 we show an example of loadings curves taken from a recent paper [10] explaining how the \nlocation of the putative stem cell location may be discriminated from that of TA and TD cell \nlocations, in another type of adult human stem cell found in intestinal crypts (the regular deep \ninfoldings of intestinal epithelium which incorporate a proliferating compartment giving rise to \nreplacement cells for shed surface epithelium) in both small and large bowel. \n Further examples of the use of near-field photothermal micro-spectroscopy with data \nanalysis using PCA-LDA in biomedical research may be found in [2, 10-16]. In a study of \nexfoliative cervical cytology [15], it was found that biomarkers of progression from normal to low-\ngrade, high-grade and severe dyskaryosis included the degree of protein phosphorylation at a \nwavenumber of 970   cm\n-1\n, glycogen at 1030 cm\n-1\n, and shifts in the centroid of the amide I peak at \naround 1650 cm\n-1\n, indicating changes in the secondary structure of intracellular proteins. Cancer of \nthe prostate gland, which is composed of a number of different zones (peripheral, transitional, and \ncentral), has also been studied using microspectroscopy [12]. Many of the spectra from epithelial \ncells in the transitional zone, as compared with those from normal cells, show significant \nbiochemical alterations as indicated by ratios of peak heights (e.g. RNA vs. DNA, carbohydrate vs. \nphosphate). Such differences may correlate with genetic changes, possibly indicating cancer-\ninitiating features. Indeed, these TZ spectra have much in common with spectra from cancerous \ncells. However, most of the pathology in this zone is benign despite the occurrence of this cancer-\nlike phenotype, which in the absence of a suitable growth-promoting stimulus remains non-\nmalignant. To add to this paradox, the spectra from cancerous cells do not resemble most of the \nspectra from the peripheral zone, where most carcinoma occurs. This suggests that for individual \ncells, what is crucial is not their degree of susceptibility to the initiating events associated with \nmutation hits. Instead, probably the most important factor is that in the peripheral zone, there is a \nmuch larger number of epithelial cells which (despite their lower mutation-susceptibility), once they \nhave mutated, can act as targets for stimuli such as hormone exposure that may produce malignant \ngrowth. \n  \nA non-statistical method of classification, employing fuzzy logic  \n \n    The photothermally-induced resonance technique. In this second example of near-field \nspectroscopic characterization of biomaterials, instead of PTMS the AFM-IR (PTIR) technique was \nused [17]. Here, this photothermally-induced resonance method of detection employed top-down \nillumination from a bench-top OPA. The OPA pulse produces a very rapid transient local \nabsorption-induced heating of the sample, and this is detected via the transient resonances of the \ncantilever vibration [3-5]. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) power density spectra of the cantilever \ndeflection as a function of wavelength are then recorded. Using such data, it is possible to group the \ndifferent samples into classes: in addition, we may perform infrared mapping, where the \nconfidences of classification are used to determine image contrast. In this experiment, FFT spectra \nwere obtained at ten different probe positions on a polystyrene sample in the form of a 100-\u03bcm bead \nsupported on mica as represented in Fig. 5, where positions 1-5 and 6-10 are on-sample and off-\nsample locations respectively. \n                   \nFigure 5: Polystyrene sample, showing on-sample (1-5) and off-sample (6-10) locations at which \nphotothermally-induced resonance FFT spectra were obtained  \n \nWe present this example as an illustration of possible advantages of employing a non-statistical \nmethod of data analysis such as \u201ceClas\u201d, a self-learning classifier that employs fuzzy logic [8, 18]. \neClas is a supervised method, and training is performed using a set of data of known class. After \nvalidation of the model, it is used to test the remaining data. The output gives a reading of class \n(e.g. on-sample versus off-sample) for each set of data, together with a value of confidence of \nassignment to its class which can also provide the basis of a method for generating image contrast. \nAn evolving Tagaki-Sugeno type of fuzzy rule-based model such as eClas addresses the challenge \nof how to interpret data in real time. The model structure can evolve gradually, according to the \nchanging requirements of a data stream. Each retraining iteration will modify only one, or a few, of \nthe fuzzy rules.  This gives the fuzzy approach an advantage over some alternatives, where iterative \nretraining could lead to a loss of previous information. \n \n    Determination of classification confidence and IR mapping. Fig. 6 shows that the resulting \nclassification is consistent with the known distribution of the two materials: \n                            \nFigure 6: Confidences of classification (on- or off-sample), derived from the FFT data recorded at \nthe locations shown in Fig. 5. Data from the extreme locations 1,2, 9 and 10 were used for training, \nand the figure shows classification results for the intermediate locations. The signal to noise ratio is \nexcellent, as may be seen by comparing each bar with the sample location as indicated in the \ndiagram. \n \nOf course this method may be applied to PTMS data also: in another experiment [19], a two-\ncomponent sample was prepared, in the form of a microtomed section having a sharp boundary \nbetween Araldite resin and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). A topographic image showed this \nborder running vertically down the image, and PTMS spectra were acquired in steps of 0.5 \u00b5m in \nhorizontal lines from one material through the border to the other material. The sequence of spectral \nacquisition and probe movement was carried out many times, until an array of spectra measuring 1 \nby 30 \u00b5m was created with a spatial resolution of 0.5 \u00b5m. Training spectra having known a priori \nclasses were chosen from the edge regions of the sample, assumed to be pure PET and Araldite.  \nAfter satisfactory validation, the model was used for testing all the spectra in the central region of \nthe sample spanning the boundary between the two materials. Classification confidences ranged \nfrom 100% down to zero in the centre, as shown in Fig. 7. This may also be shown clearly on an IR \nmap, where confidence of assignment to the class as determined by the fuzzy rule-based model may \nbe plotted to give an \u201cimage\u201d (see Fig. 8). The PET\/Araldite boundary shows up in these \nclassification confidence data, as a vertical low- confidence gap where the spectra were \ncharacteristic of neither PET nor Araldite. \n                             \nFigure 7: Classification confidences derived from PTMS data obtained at locations straddling an \nAraldite\/PET boundary (x-scale in microns) \n \n                    \nFigure 8: Example of an IR map derived from classification confidences, using PTMS data \nobtained at 80 locations on an Araldite\/PET sample. The boundary between the two materials runs \nvertically up the centre of the image. (In this figure, the numerical values and false greyscale \nintensities shown refer to Araldite on the left and PET on the right) \n \n   Molecular groups primarily responsible for delineation \nThe training stage yields an additional type of information, called \u201cfeature weights\u201d: the fuzzy rules \nare the key component of the model that is being determined during training, which reveals which \nfeatures are primarily responsible for the separation into classes. It is possible to tabulate the \nrelative importance of each feature (e.g. FFT frequency, or each wavenumber, depending on the \nnature of the data), as measured by its \u201cdegree of accumulated fuzzily-weighted usage\u201d in helping \nto determine the fuzzy rules. \n   A graph of these weights as a function of wavenumber thus provides an interesting alternative to a \nloading curve derived from the same data by PCA-LDA, in order to determine which molecular \ngroups are primarily responsible for the separation into classes. A comparison of these very \ndifferent approaches is described elsewhere [19]. \n Possible applications of the fuzzy logic approach \n \nGiven these initial results on Araldite-based samples, these latter approaches should in principle be \napplicable to resin-embedded biological sections. It should, therefore, be possible to match IR maps \nof tissue sections to images obtained by conventional transmission techniques, and thus correlate \nany non-random patterns identifiable with the known micro-anatomical profile. \n \n \nConcluding remarks: could the use of spectroscopic biomarkers become part of biomedical \nevaluation procedures? \n \nGiven such methods of data analysis and classification, there is no fundamental obstacle to further \nimprovements to these PTMS and PTIR techniques to the point where further challenges can be \nmet: for example, routine imaging of subcellular detail, the detection of significant inter-class \ndifferences in the base structure of cellular DNA, etc., provided that the necessary advances in \nprobe fabrication and other instrumental technology can be developed. An exciting achievement \nwould be a single cell map where different molecular components within the single cell would be \nclearly correlated with specific well-recognised subcellular compartments. Of particular interest \nwould be the possibility of recognising meaningful variation in nuclear substructure that may \ncorrelate with function and differentiation. This is not possible with commercial micro-FTIR, and \nwould greatly enhance the impact of microspectroscopy for biomedical scientists. \n   In circumstances where significant diagnostic difficulties arise in the assessment of recurring \nrelatively common problems, the favoured type of evaluation is known as histopathological \nconsensus diagnosis, where several histopathologists deliver an opinion on the same sample set.  To \nsatisfy the current gold standard represented by established procedures is time-consuming and \nexpensive, requires an appropriate number of suitably-qualified experts, and remains open to \nunresolved differences of opinion. A major disadvantage of microscopic methodologies such as \nconfocal microscopy is that in general, they are restricted to the mapping, in any one experiment, of \nonly one or a few biomarkers which may be identified through the application of an antibody or \nother specific binding molecule suitably labelled with a fluorescent tag. Moreover a lung biopsy, for \nexample, may contain only a small number of suspicious cells, sometimes insufficient in number for \na diagnosis of cancer to be agreed. The use of vibrational spectra thus provides the tempting \nalternative possibility of providing a diagnosis from a very small number of cells, since spectral \nabsorbance bands form strong candidates to provide robust biomarkers: examples include amide I \n(\uf0bb1650 cm-1), asymmetric phosphate (\u03bdasPO2\n-\n, \uf0bb1225 cm-1); symmetric phosphate (\u03bdsPO2\n-\n \uf0bb1080 \ncm-1); and glycogen (\uf0bb1030 cm-1). Refs. [8] and [15] discuss the example of cervical cytology, \nwhere although there already exist semi-automated morphometric and related techniques which, in \nprinciple, can identify suspect cells or clusters, the possibility of developing a fully quantitative and \nobjective procedure is a realistic target.  \n   However, establishing such a major change in procedures would be a formidable task. Relatively \nsmall spectral changes are generated that are heavily dependent on chance spatial variation in which \npart of the sample is to be analysed. Moreover, complications arise from the different ratios and\/or \nconformations of biomolecules that give rise to subtle changes in absorbance peaks (i.e. shape, shift \nand\/or intensity) and indicate intracellular alterations. If this approach is to bear fruit, the \nestablishment of a new diagnostic gold standard, together with appropriate information-processing \nalgorithms, will be essential. Existing modalities which permit analysis of progression of a disease \n(or progression from stem cell to differentiated cell) must be used to validate any proposed \nevaluation procedure [2]. \n \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nI gratefully acknowledge the experimental and interpretative work performed by colleagues at the \nUniversity of Lancaster (UL) and the University of East Anglia (UEA), within the following \nresearch fields in particular: (PTMS) Azzedine Hammiche (UL) and Mike Reading (UEA); (stem \ncells) Nigel Fullwood (UL), Matt German (UL), Olaug Grude (UL) and Frank Martin (UL); (PTIR \nand polymer science) Jonathan Moffatt (UEA) and Mike Reading (UEA); and (fuzzy classification) \nPlamen Angelov (UL), Olaug Grude (UL) and Jemma Kelly (UL).
