Coelho* \nLondon School of Economics and Political Science \n \n \nABSTRACT: Unrealistic optimism is all around us, and it is a well documented \npsychological phenomenon. It has important implications in many economic and \nmanagerial contexts, yet economists, managers and policy makers still ignore it or fail to \nunderstand its characteristics. Here we investigate the psychology of over-optimism and \nbring to bear substantial psychological evidence that most people are prone to groundless \noptimism when faced with economic and management decisions. Although the policy and \nwelfare implications of such a widespread phenomenon are vast, we argue that they have \nbeen neglected by policy makers. We end by challenging the current public policy trend of \nextending lending to business start-ups, on the grounds that it may create a real road to ruin. \n \nKey words: over-optimism, entrepreneurship, public policy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* I thank David de Meza, Simon Parker, Neil Weinstein, and an anonymous reviewer for their very \nhelpful comments.

Introduction \n \nStandard neo-classical economic theory assumes that individuals are fully rational, even \nthough as far back as 1776 Adam Smith (Smith, 1937) was convinced that most people display \nthe trait which modern psychologists refer to with the pleonasm \u201cunrealistic optimism\u201d: \n \n\u201cThe overweening conceit which the greater part of men have of their abilities is an \nancient evil remarked by the philosophers and moralists of all ages\u2026.The chance of gain is \nby every man more or less overvalued and the chance of loss by most men undervalued and \nby scarce any man valued more than it is worth\u201d  \nAdam Smith (1776)  \n \nIn this paper we challenge the neo-classical economic approach, since much psychological \nevidence shows that subjects do not have rational expectations, but rather that they are \nunrealistically optimistic: \u201cAccording to popular belief, people tend to think that they are \ninvulnerable. They expect others to be victims of misfortune, not themselves\u201d (Weinstein, \n1980, p. 806). This hopeful outlook on life implies \u201ca judgement error\u201d which Weinstein called \nunrealistic optimism or optimistic bias1.  \n \nAs yet, little research exists on whether optimistic biases affect economic\/managerial decisions \nand on whether institutions evolve to exploit this, even though we can observe many real world \nsituations which suggest that unrealistic optimism is at work. Here are a few examples: \n1. Risk averse (or risk neutral) individuals can be shown to prefer self-employment over paid \nemployment, not because they are more able than other individuals but because they \nmistakenly believe that they will beat the odds (i.e., had they forecast the future correctly, \nthey would have preferred paid-employment (M. P. Coelho, 2004). \n                                                 \n1\n Unique invulnerability (Perloff, 1983) is another term applied to describe similar phenomena. \n 3\n2. The failure rates of business start-ups are notoriously high all over the world. One of the \nmost frequently quoted studies of business survival, by (Dun&Bradstreet, 1967) reports \nthat only a third of new businesses survive more than four years.2 A natural explanation for \nthis is that budding entrepreneurs facing the uncertainty of starting a business believe \nunrealistically that they will beat the odds. \n3. The popularity of performance-based contracts, such as stock options, especially in dot-\ncoms, may well be beyond what standard principal-agent theory would predict. Unrealistic \noptimism leads people to attribute the wrong probabilities to events (to overestimate the \nprobabilities of positive events and underestimate the probabilities of negative events), and \neven when risk is high it might lead them to prefer riskier contracts \u2013 not because they are \nrisk prone but because they think they can beat the odds.  \n4. \u201cCrops with larger yield variation are more likely to be farmed with cash leases, where \nfarmers pay a fixed fee to lease the land and bear all the crop risk themselves\u201d (Camerer \nand Lovallo, 1999, p. 315). These farmers may simply believe that they can beat the odds. \n \nThe little research that does exist in economics and management which takes on board the fact \nthat people are prone to optimistic illusions is, for the most part, rather imprecise: \n1. Researchers frequently adopt different definitions of over-confidence and over-optimism \n(which frequently leads to misunderstandings) or, more importantly, misuse psychological \ntheory and findings when they apply it to economic or management issues. \n2. The methodologies usually used to measure optimistic biases are not conclusive. For \nexample, finding that the majority of the population believes that the probability of them \nhaving a heart attack is below that of others is not sufficient to draw conclusions on over-\noptimism. Additionally, when testing for the existence of optimistic illusions, many \nresearchers simply ask subjects directly about their forecast of the likelihood of a specific \nevent occurring to them (i.e., they ask for an explicit forecast) and so there is no real \nincentive for subjects to reveal their true beliefs. Subjects\u2019 desire to impress the researcher, \nor to report what they believe the researcher expects from them, may influence the \nfindings. \n                                                 \n2\n See (Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1998) for a brief literature review on business survival rates. \n 4\n3. It is usually assumed that if a group of people shows optimistic illusions in one specific \nsituation, or about a specific issue, they will be over-optimistic about all sorts of real-life \nsituations. This does not seem to be the case.  \n \nAs we will see, optimistic biases are robust and widespread. Pessimistic biases are rare. \nFurthermore, these positive illusions create distortions which may be the most important source \nof efficiency loss in the economic system, and as yet their policy implications have been \nignored. Consider the role of government in facilitating credit to start-up companies and \nincentivising entrepreneurship in order to foster economic growth and employment. What if in \ndoing so it is (unknowingly) acting against entrepreneurs\u2019 best financial interests, and \ngenerating large welfare losses? Substantial evidence suggests this may well be the case: as we \nwill see, entrepreneurial settings tend to attract and foster unrealistic optimism, and these \npublic policy measures may end up backing irrational beliefs. \n \nGiven the implications of optimistic illusions on economics and managerial issues, a \nclarification of their meaning, how they are measured and what determines them is important. \nSince the policy implications may not be negligible, a clear understanding of when the \noptimistic biases are more likely to occur is also called for. In this article we tackle these \nissues, and bring to bear the bulk of psychological evidence that shows that most people are \nprone to groundless optimism when facing management and economic decisions\/situations.  \n \nWe begin (in Section 2) by analysing the meaning of unrealistic optimism and how it is \nmeasured, providing evidence that unrealistic optimism is a robust and widespread \npsychological phenomenon, and, finally, identifying the determinants of unrealistic optimism \nto enable us to predict when it is more likely to occur. In Section 3 we argue that \nentrepreneurial settings are bound to attract over-optimists and foster unrealistic optimism. We \nprovide recent empirical evidence to support this. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss some of the \nimplications of unrealistic optimism for public policy, and challenge the current \nentrepreneurial policy trends towards financing business start-ups. \n \n \n 5\n2. The psychology of unrealistic optimism \n \n2.1. The meaning of unrealistic optimism \n \nThere is widespread evidence of self-serving biases in social comparison. Most people believe \nthey are more capable than average and that their chances of a better future are higher than \nthose of others. However, these self-serving biases do not only emerge when people compare \nthemselves to others, but are also present in absolute terms (Weinstein, Rothman, & Klein, \n1996); (Strecher, Kreuter, & Kobrin, 1995). Indeed, there is evidence that normal, mentally \nhealthy individuals\u2019 perceptions of reality are characterized not by an accurate assessment of \ntheir personal qualities, a realistic estimate of their degree of personal control, and a realistic \noutlook on the future, but are biased and self-serving. Taylor and Brown (1988) call these \n(positive) illusions. \n \nIn this paper we focus on one particular type of positive illusion: unrealistic optimism (UO). \nUO refers to an underestimation of the likelihood of experiencing negative events and to an \noverestimation of the probability of experiencing positive events (Weinstein & Klein, 1996, \np.2) \u2013 i.e., to a mismatch between subjective and objective probabilities. Hence UO implies \nthat the mean forecast errors are significantly different from zero. \n \nAccording to Weinstein\u2019s definition (Weinstein & Klein, 1996), optimism is different from \nunrealistic optimism and the two should not be confused. An individual who expects, ex-ante, \nthat his\/her risk of experiencing an undesirable event is below average is optimistic, but the \noptimism is not necessarily a bias or an illusion. Ex-post, this person\u2019s perceptions might prove \nto be correct, in which case, he\/she would be optimistic without being unrealistically \noptimistic. Therefore, one does not need the outcome before calling an optimistic prediction \nsimply optimistic, whereas unrealistic optimistic predictions need to be tethered in \u201creality\u201d.  \n \nUO is also different from high self-esteem. The latter involves an evaluation of the self, \nwhereas the former involves temporal predictions about the future which are probably based on \nthose self evaluations.  \n 6\n \nNote also that although probably correlated with risk preference, UO is distinct from risk \npreference, i.e., the extent to which the subjective odds must be favourable before a gamble \nwill be accepted. Furthermore, UO is also different from overconfidence, which is also a \npositive illusion but refers to an unfounded excessive precision in forecasting, i.e. to \nconfidence intervals being too narrow3 (see (Fischhoff, 1982) for a review of the concept). \n \nUO can be measured in absolute terms as the difference between an individual\u2019s subjective \nestimate of the probability of a good\/bad event occurring and the \u201ctrue\u201d value of that \nprobability. For example, for a negative event (such as being fired in the next couple of \nmonths), if the estimate of the probability is lower than the actual probability, then there is \nevidence of UO. UO can also be measured directly through experimental work which \ncompares subjects\u2019 expectations with actual realizations (M. P. Coelho, 2004). When \nmeasuring UO in absolute terms, we can observe that in the presence of UO the distribution of \nsubjective probabilities when compared to the \u201ctrue\u201d distribution of probabilities is shifted to \nthe right4.  \n \nEven though UO can be measured in this way, very few psychological studies attempt to do so, \nfor two reasons: (1) the difficulty in determining an accurate probability for a particular \nindividual in a particular situation (in some cases, illusions about the future are difficult to \nestablish operationally because no-one knows what the future will bring), and (2) the difficulty \nindividuals have in understanding and providing probabilities (Gigerenzer, 2002; Weinstein & \nKlein, 1996). \n \nAs a result the usual procedure to analyse UO has been to carry out a comparative (as opposed \nto an absolute) analysis. Under a comparative approach subjects are asked whether they think \n                                                 \n3\n As Blanton, Pelham, DeHart, & Carvalho, (2001) describe it \u201cthe most common technique for assessing \noverconfidence involves asking people to answer a number of general knowledge questions and then having them \nestimate the probability that they have answered each question correctly. If respondents\u2019 mean confidence scores \nare higher than their mean accuracy scores, this is taken as evidence of overconfidence\u201d (p. 373). \n4\n More technically, for positive (negative) events the subjective distribution of probabilities (cdf) stochastically \ndominates (is dominated by) the objective distribution.  \n 7\nthat the probability of a certain event happening to them is lower or higher than that of it \nhappening to their peers, and the assessment of the \u201cerror in judgement\u201d is made on a group \nbasis. If the individuals providing personal estimates are a representative sample of the \ncomparison group, and if there is a significant tendency for the self mean to be lower than the \ncomparison group mean (for negative events), then subjects are making a systematic error, and \ntherefore there is evidence of UO \u2013 the reasoning being that the mean risk for the group is, by \ndefinition, the mean of the risks of its members (Harris, 1996; Weinstein & Klein, 1996).  \n \nHowever, comparative analysis has important limitations: \n1. The rationale outlined above is only true if the distribution of probabilities of the bad event \noccurring is symmetric (or not too skewed to the left). If the distribution of probabilities is \nskewed to the left (which is the case, for example, if we are analysing the risks of \ncontracting a specific disease and the sample is relatively healthy) we will have the \nmajority of subjects with a probability of the bad event occurring to them below that of the \nmean of the group, and a minority of subjects with a probability of the bad event occurring \nto them above that of the mean of the group. In this case, the comparative analysis \ninterpretation can not be applied. It should be mentioned, however, that some studies do \nask about individuals\u2019 beliefs when compared to the \u2018median\u2019 (Kruger & Burrus, 2004). \n2. A more important limitation of this approach is that the determinants of optimism (at the \nindividual level) can not be identified.  \n3. Comparative risk estimates are optimistically biased, at least in part, because people may \ncompare themselves with an inappropriate standard person who has all the characteristics \nthat increase risk. Evidence shows, though, that the optimistic bias is related more to \n(absolute) unrealistic optimism than just to an inappropriate comparison group (e.g. \n(Kruger & Burrus, 2004; Weinstein & Lachendro, 1982)). \n \n2.2. Brief overview of psychological evidence \n \nWeinstein\u2019s (1980) pioneer study examined a range of positive and negative real life events \nthat could occur sometime in the future to determine the extent of (comparative) UO and the \nconditions under which it is more likely to occur. His analysis supported the hypothesis that \n 8\nthere are strong unrealistic optimistic tendencies in both positive and negative life events. \nWeinstein\u2019s findings are supported by, for example, those of Gollwitzer and Taylor (1995, p. \n214), who state that: \u201cThis illusion of invulnerability is both robust and pervasive, \nencompassing a wide variety of potentially threatening events\u201d. Although less researched, there \nis also substantial evidence that absolute UO not only exists but is the norm (Weinstein et al. \n(1996), (Strecher et al., 1995), Coelho (2004)). \n \nUO is a robust and widespread phenomenon. It is not limited to questionnaire responses \nconcerning remote events. On the contrary, it is present in real, immediate, visually vivid and \npotentially risky situations (Harris et al. (1996) and (Taylor et al., 1992). Evidence also shows \nthat UO about negative experiences persists even after them happening to people (Burger & \nPalmer, 1992). As a consequence, UO precludes early withdrawal even when the events are \nluck driven (e.g. gambling in Gibson and Sanbonmatsu, 2004). In many situations, such as \nbusiness, where the persistence in a risky\/loss endeavour is unlikely to be rewarded, the \nnegative outlook which characterizes pessimists seems to be a plus. It leads to withdrawal, \ntherefore limiting losses. Conversely, optimists may wait too long before closing failing \nbusinesses. \n \nAlthough, in theory, optimism could reduce effort if individuals over-rate ability, more effort is \nalso possible if individual\u2019s positive outlook of life leads them to strive to achieve their goals. \nEvidence shows that (over-optimistic) entrepreneurs work longer hours - on average 17 hours \nper week more - than non-entrepreneurs, and that they are more likely to say that they will \nwork forever (see Puri & Robinson, 2004). These are not the only authors to find evidence that \neffort increases with optimism - Landier & Thesmar (2003), among others, found similar \nevidence. \n \nDeliberating about the future (predecisional phase) and implementing decisions already made \n(postdecisional phase) require individuals to develop different types of tasks. During a \npredecisional phase, individuals need to solve the task of choosing goals that are feasible and \ndesirable, whilst during a postdecisional phase, individuals attempt to implement the chosen \ngoals (and, therefore, attempt to promote goal attainment). By becoming involved in these \ndifferent kinds of tasks, people develop different cognitive orientations or mindsets that help \n 9\nsolve the respective task at hand (Gollwitzer & Kinney, 1989), pp. 531-32). There is evidence \nthat the mere request to reflect on a decision (for example, on whether or not to change a \ndecision) triggers a mindset that is unbiased in terms of considering both the positive and \nnegative consequences of the decision. In contrast, post-decisional individuals are clearly \nreluctant to deliberate on decisions already made5: they (1) concentrate on implementation-\nrelated issues, and (2) prefer to think about the positive aspects of the chosen alternative and to \nminimize the negative ones (Gollwitzer & Taylor, 1995, p. 223). When compared to subjects in \nan implemental mindset, participants in a deliberative mindset have (1) significantly lower \nperceptions of control of their actions, as well as of what surrounds them (the environment for \ntask implementation), (2) significantly poorer mood, (3) significantly lower self-esteem, (4) \nsignificantly lower perceived invulnerability to risk involved in negative events (less \nunrealistic optimism), and (5) see themselves more negatively (in terms of perceptions of their \nskills and talents)6. Although psychologists suggest that people can deliberately control their \nrelative degree of realism and optimism (in terms of their views of themselves, their degree of \ncontrol, and their future), by addressing a specific issue in a deliberative or implemental \nmindset, respectively, evidence shows that when deliberating about the future or when \nimplementing projects people suffer positive delusions. Furthermore, to ensure sensible \ndecisions, it is not sufficient to concentrate on action-outcome expectancy.  \n \nThe distinction between deliberative and implementation mindsets is therefore important given \nits close links to entrepreneurial activity \u2013 it helps clarify how wedded to their business ideas \nentrepreneurs can be once they have decided to pursue them. \n \nMost of the research in psychology on the relationship between risk preferences and optimistic \nbiases shows that there is no clear evidence of the relation between the two, which seems to \nsuggest that the two variables are not necessarily related (Hillman & Todesco, 1999); (Cohn, \nMacfarlane, Yanez, & Imai, 1995); (M. P. Coelho, 2004)). \n                                                 \n5\n This is true both for individuals still waiting to begin implementing their decisions and those who have already \nstarted. \n6\n It is interesting to note the finding that women\u2019s self-perceptions are revealed to be significantly poorer than \nthose of men, especially in the deliberative mindset condition, which seems to indicate that increasing the \nproportion of women in companies may contribute to more realism in the decision making process. \n 10\n \n2.3. Determinants of unrealistic optimism  \n \nIt is very difficult to establish whether someone is unrealistically optimistic for a variety of \nevents, and to our knowledge no-one has tried to do so. What research on UO has shown is that \nalthough many events produce optimistic illusions, not all do, and that the magnitude of the \nbias varies greatly between events. In parallel, there is evidence that there are not consistently \nrealistic or unrealistic types of people, and that in fact people\u2019s degree of optimism varies by \ntopic\/situation. Understanding the determinants of UO and other self-related biases therefore \nconstitutes a key theoretical debate in psychology, since it will help us predict when such \nbiases will occur - which is extremely important not only for economic and managerial issues \nbut also for policy considerations. As we will see, the conditions under which optimistic biases \nare more likely to occur will lead us to conclude that entrepreneurs and business people in \ngeneral are prone to such illusions. \n \nIn order to understand the determinants of UO it is important to learn whether they are \nessentially motivational or cognitive in nature, i.e., whether people intentionally distort \ninformation in order to serve a given purpose (motivational explanation), or whether people \nshould be considered innocent victims of their thought processes (cognitive explanation) \n(Hoorens, 1993). We believe both types of explanation are called for. \n \nThree motivational explanations are usually put forward as supporting self-serving biases: \n\u2022 Enhancing or maintaining self-esteem (self-enhancement or self-validation) \n\u2022 Projecting a positive social image or, in other words, ingratiating oneself with others (self-\npresentation); \n\u2022 Reducing fear and protecting the ego from threats associated with facing unwanted \noutcomes (striving for reassurance) \n \nOf these motives, only the first has sufficient theoretical and empirical evidence to support it \n(Hoorens, 1993). Indeed, Weinstein (1980) found that when individuals have some degree of \n 11\ncommitment or emotional investment in a certain outcome, and they want to protect their self-\nesteem (self-enhancement), the majority of factors they bring to mind are precisely the ones \nthat increase the likelihood of the outcome being the one they want. If this is true, one would \nexpect individuals with low levels of self-esteem (such as depressed individuals) to be \ngenerally less optimistic than those with high levels of self- esteem (non-depressed \nindividuals). There is sufficient evidence to support this (see namely (Pyszczynski, Holt, & \nGreenberg, 1987). \n \nIn terms of cognitive explanations of UO, the following cognitive errors are usually put \nforward: \n\u2022 Illusion of control: Weinstein (1980) found that for the optimistic biases to arise the event \nneeds to be perceived as controllable. Controllability of an event remains a powerful \npredictor of the magnitude of the optimistic bias (Harris P., 1996).  \n\u2022 Extreme probability biases: there is evidence (Weinstein et al., 1996) supporting Slovic\u2019s \n(1987) theory that people slightly overestimate small risks (i.e., unrealistic pessimism) and \nmoderately underestimate large ones (i.e., unrealistic optimism).  \n\u2022 Past experience with the event: Weinstein (1980, 1989) found that lack of personal \nexperience (\u201cunfamiliarity\u201d) with contingency breeds optimism.  \n \nWhile some authors argue whether UO has motivational or cognitive explanations, others \nsuggest that there is no reason why optimism cannot have both motivational and cognitive \nexplanations. The most prominent integration between the two types of explanation is that the \nmotivational explanation constitutes the why of self-related biases while cognitive errors \nconstitute the how of their emergence (Hoorens, 1993, pg 134).  \n \nIndeed, motivational explanations alone are not able to explain UO. If they were, we would \nhave a world of (foolish) people who realise they commit judgement errors - that, in many \ncases, imply personal decisions and behaviours that negatively affect their health and wealth - \nbut insist on committing them. Cognitive explanations are therefore called for. But cognitive \nexplanations alone are not sufficient either to explain UO. The strongest evidence of this is the \nobservation that most self-related biases are in a self-flattering direction, and \u201cif self-related \nbiases were caused only by non-motivated cognitive errors, then one would expect about as \n 12\nmany instances of self-deprecating biases as of self flattering ones (Hoorens, 1993; Weinstein, \n1989, Hoorens, 1993. p.46).  \n \nIn summary, there is strong evidence (for both positive and negative events) that the following \ntwo conditions must be fulfilled for UO to arise (Weinstein, 1980): \n \n1. Individuals need to have some degree of commitment or emotional investment in the \noutcome (motivational explanation); \n2. The event needs to be perceived as controllable, i.e., that there are things one can do or \ncontemplate doing to influence the event (cognitive explanation). \n \n3. Entrepreneurial optimism  \n \nGiven that optimistic biases are robust and widespread, two important questions arise which \nwe explore in this section \n1. What are the consequences of UO for day-to-day activities in general - and \neconomic\/managerial activities in particular? \n2. Is UO present in entrepreneurial settings? \n \n3.1. Consequences of UO \n \nIn many circumstances maintaining positive illusions seems to have no negative consequences, \nand may even be beneficial in helping to \u201cmake each individual\u2019s world a warmer and more \nactive and beneficial place in which to live\u201d (Taylor & Brown, 1988, p. 205). For instance, \nthinking that one is more generous or more understanding than one really is, may be \nconsidered an innocuous self-delusion; maintaining illusory beliefs about personal capabilities, \nand what the future holds, may lead people to try harder on difficult tasks so that they really do \nsucceed more often (Weinstein, 1989; Taylor and Brown, 1988). Although more controversial, \nthere is some evidence that UO is also predictive of general physical well-being. For example, \n 13\nthere is evidence that UO is positively correlated with lower mortality risk for cancer patients, \nand with positive health-related behaviours of both men at risk of AIDS (Taylor et al., 1992) \nand women during pregnancy (Park, Moore, Turner, & Adler, 1997).  \n \nResearch evidence indicates that self-enhancing perceptions, exaggerated beliefs of personal \ncontrol, and unrealistic optimism are associated with higher motivation, greater persistence at \ntasks, more effective performance, and ultimately, greater success. \u201cA chief value of these \nillusions may be that they can create self-fulfilling prophecies. They may help people to try \nharder in situations with objectively poor probabilities of success\u2026\u201d (Taylor & Brown, 1988), \np.199).  \n \nHowever, UO has a negative side: almost by definition, people who believe, falsely, that their \npersonal attributes exempt them from risk, or that their present actions reduce the risks they \nface, may be inclined to engage in too risky behaviours and\/or fail to take the precautions \nrequired to avoid adverse outcomes. Indeed, there is evidence (Weinstein, 1982) that since UO \nprevents people from perceiving the objective risks of certain events (e.g. failure to admit that \nsmoking, driving after drinking alcohol, or having unprotected sex puts you at risk) they do not \nprepare appropriately to address (or avoid) them. \n \nThe negative consequences associated with UO are not restricted to health related issues, but \nalso affect economic decision-making. In many economic situations, having systematic \noptimistic biases about our future is not desirable, as it mainly leads agents to persist in \nbusiness too long, with significant negative implications for economic growth and the efficient \nuse of resources.  \n \nDespite the fact that it is often argued that entrepreneurial activity requires optimism, one \nshould not overlook the fact that if individuals have a false (positive) view of themselves and \nof their business, they may persevere in business even when they are ill suited for it. Their \nbiased attention to positive stimuli, and tendency to reframe negative situations, may lead them \nto persist in the face of adversity (Gibson & Sanbonmatsu, 2004) when withdrawal would be \nmore prudent. This is not only due to the opportunity and psychological costs for employees, \nbut also because failure of a business is generally bad news for customers, suppliers and \nfinancial institutions; i.e. negative externalities that are often ignored.  \n \n 14\nThe propensity to overlook negative signs when a project is underway (i.e. when an \nimplementation mindset is predominant) reinforces the previous claims \u2013 i.e. people tend to \npersist in businesses\/projects when pulling out would be more sensible. Unrealistic planning, \nanother consequence of excessive optimistic biases, can also not only seriously damage the \nperformance of firms and but also employees\u2019 careers. \n \nAn interesting debate in question is whether \u2018external regulators\u2019 exist to keep optimistic biases \nunder check. Taylor and Brown (1988) claim that non-ego-related information may exist (e.g. \n\u2018external regulators\u2019), to offset the effects of illusions by leading people to adjust their \nbehaviour. We believe, though, that the \u2018external regulators\u2019 do not always exist, or in some \ncases are activated too late (e.g. bankruptcy law). In other cases, \u2018external regulators\u2019 may even \nfoster optimism (e.g. the provision of government-backed start-up loans that are extended on \nfavourable terms) and, inadvertently, increase losses instead of stopping them. Finally, there is \nevidence that a large percentage of entrepreneurs is not easily diverted from the course of \naction they believe to be the best - they do not listen to external (paid) advice and, contrary to \nthird party recommendations, launch and persist in businesses7 (Thaler & Sunstein, 2003b; \n\u00c5stebro, 2003, p. 237). (Kahneman & Lovallo, 2003), p. 60) also present evidence of a \u201cteam \nmember\u201d tendency to ignore pessimistic information given by external advisors, and proceed \nwith planned projects.  \n \n3.2. Evidence of entrepreneurial UO \n \nIn the sections above we have investigated which conditions are prone to trigger optimistic \nbeliefs. Entrepreneurial settings are bound to attract and foster over-optimistic beliefs, for both \nmotivational and cognitive factors. Firstly, entrepreneurs typically have most of their personal \nwealth tied up in their businesses, so their degree of commitment or emotional investment in \nthe outcome of their activity is extremely high, making them especially optimistic about the \nresult. Secondly, individuals are more optimistic about outcomes they believe are under their \ncontrol, and setting up and running a business is an activity in which illusions of control are \n                                                 \n7\n Note, though, that external advisors may also be prone to optimism or that the self-interest of external advisors \n(agents) may lead them not to act in the entrepreneur\u2019s (principal) best interests. \n 15\nlikely to be felt8. Thirdly, there is evidence that individuals tend to underestimate likely \nnegative events, as is the case of new business failure (only 30% of new businesses survive \nmore than 4 years9). Fourthly, succeeding in business is a \u201ccommon desirable event\u201d which \nnecessarily breeds positive illusionary beliefs. Finally, since starting a new business is \ninevitably unexplored territory, there is scope for unchecked fantasizing and optimism is \nnecessarily greater.  \n \nBelow we summarize some interesting findings that provide strong evidence of entrepreneurial \noptimism. \n \nAlthough there is striking evidence on the discrepancy between financial returns to self-\nemployment and to paid employment in favour of the latter, this does not dissuade \nentrepreneurs. The U.S. Small Business Administration ( 1997) found that one-sixth of self-\nemployed individuals earn less than the minimum wage. On the face of it, this might reflect \nlower skilled individuals being forced into self-employment. (Hamilton, 2000) shows, \nhowever, that it is unlikely that this is due to selection effects since the wage distribution of \nthose becoming self-employed (i.e., before they took that step) does not appear to be \nsignificantly different from that of those staying in paid employment. Even controlling for skill \nand a wide variety of other characteristics, entrepreneurs enter and persist in business despite \nachieving lower initial earnings and lower earnings growth than they could have achieved in \npaid employment (for individuals in business for 10 years, the median earnings differential was \nfound to be 35 percent). Non-pecuniary benefits could be part of the explanation, but the fact \nthat entrepreneurs are sacrificing substantial earnings lends plausibility to the notion that \nmisperceptions are at play.  \n \nLooking at innovation undertaken by independent inventors, \u00c5stebro (2003) reports even more \nstriking commitments to loss making ventures. The chance of innovations reaching the market \nis approximately 7%. Of the \u201clucky\u201d 7%, some 60% realise negative returns, and the average \n                                                 \n8\n Brockhaus (1982) shows evidence that entrepreneurs have often been found to have higher levels of internal \nlocus-of-control beliefs than the general population, and that such high beliefs in their ability to influence the \nachievement of business goals imply that their perceived possibility of failure is relatively low. \n9\n For a brief summary of the literature on business survival rates see Cooper, Woo and Dunkelberg (1988, p. 99).  \n 16\nrealised return among those that commercialise their inventions is minus 7%, even ignoring the \ncost of the inventor\u2019s (often enormous) effort. Many inventors persist in trying to bring their \nideas to market despite receiving good advice that the prospect of making money is \nnegligible10, calling into question the rationality of such persistence. \n \nAn ingenious experiment by Camerer & Lovallo (1999) sheds light on the implications of \noptimistic illusions for entry decisions when all that matters is relative performance. Their \nsubjects must choose whether to enter and get paid based on performance in a tournament, or \ntake a fixed payment. Fewer subjects participate in the tournament when winners are \ndetermined randomly from amongst the entrants than when they are determined by relative \nperformance on a quiz. If people have any information about their relative ability on the quiz \nrationality suggests the opposite should occur. Most subjects who enter think the total profit \nearned by all entrants will be negative, but their own profit will be positive. When the \nrecruitment procedure involves telling subjects that quiz performance will be important, excess \nentry increases further. These self-selected subjects seem to neglect the fact that they are \ncompeting with a group of subjects who all think they are skilled as well (\"reference group \nneglect\"). \n \nConsistent with these results, Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg (1988) interviewed some 3,000 \nentrepreneurs who had recently become business owners, and they report that 81% believed \ntheir chance of success to be 70% or higher, and a remarkable 33% believed it to be a certain \n100%. Taking into account the historical evidence that some 70% of new businesses fail within \nfour  years, these results seem to confirm the hypothesis that entrepreneurs who have already \nmade the commitment to become business owners display a remarkable degree of optimism. \nThe results show that this \u201centrepreneurial euphoria\u201d is independent of the entrepreneurs\u2019 \npreparation \u2013 \u201cAll entrepreneurs, whether well prepared or not, may experience \n\"entrepreneurial euphoria\", in which they feel they must succeed and then assess their odds \naccordingly\u201d (Cooper et al., 1988, p. 107).  \n \n                                                 \n10\n There is evidence that 50% of inventors with very poor quality ideas continued to pursue efforts even when paid \nadvice strongly argues against it (\u00c5stebro, 2003, p. 237). \n 17\nPinfold (2001) reports on the returns that entrepreneurs (actual business founders in New \nZealand) expect and the level of risk they believe they are taking. His survey shows that in \ntheir eyes, starting a new business is an attractive proposition: considerable financial rewards \ncoupled with many non-pecuniary benefits such as independence, personal development, and \nemployment. Furthermore, while realizing that there are risks involved, these entrepreneurs \ntend to underrate the risk and have faith in their personal ability to overcome the odds. They \nconsistently believed the probability of their venture failing to be less than half the historical \nrate, and estimated rewards that were considerably higher than those obtained by business in \ngeneral.  \n \nArabsheibani, de Meza, Maloney, & Pearson (2000) surveyed the answers to the following two \nquestions from the British Household Panel Study: (1) \u201cWould you say that you yourself are \nbetter off, worse off or about the same financially than a year ago?\u201d, and (2) \u201cLooking ahead, \nhow do you think you yourself will be financially a year from now, better than you are now, \nworse off than now or about the same?\u201d The authors found that the self-employed expect better \nfinancial outcomes than employees but experience worse realizations. \n \nEntrepreneur\u2019s propensity to take risks is sometimes offered as a plausible explanation for \nentry into entrepreneurship, despite its relatively poor prospects. This is not supported by \nempirical evidence (Brockhaus,1982; (Moskowitz  & Vissing-Jorgensen, 2002); Puri and \nRobinson (2004); (M. Coelho & de Meza, 2007).  \n \nSummarizing, we have seen that there are conditions under which positive illusions are more \nlikely to occur. Entrepreneurial activities seem to have all these characteristics and thus one \nwould expect entrepreneurs to be relatively over optimistic when compared to the rest of the \npopulation. Empirical research indicates that this indeed the case. Even if optimism leads \nentrepreneurs to work harder and to be happier, it is their unrealistic beliefs which may be quite \ndamaging. They will tend to overestimate chances of success and therefore choose the wrong \nbusiness strategies, will back strategies that depend on skills they do not possess (as opposed to \nrelying on the expertise of outsiders), and will concentrate on positive feedback and ignore \nnegative feedback - however important it might be.  \n \n 18\n \n4. Implications for Government policy and the extension of lending \nto new businesses \n \nThere is considerable consensus among economists and policy makers that entrepreneurship \nshould be supported given its perceived contribution to economic success. There is also \nconsiderable consensus that there is failure in the market for loans, especially those for new \nbusinesses. Even more remarkably, there is agreement about the direction of the failure: \nlending should be increased from the laissez faire level. Some evidence follows supporting this \nclaim. \n \nSince the mid 1990s the OECD has focused on the virtues of entrepreneurship as an integral \npart of its employment strategy and has continued to urge member countries to create a \nmacroeconomic and structural framework in which entrepreneurship can grow by removing \nimpediments that too often exist and arranging conditions that encourage entrepreneurs to \nflourish. In the foreword to a 1998 report, Fostering Entrepreneurship (OECD, 1998), the \nSecretary General of the OECD, states his belief that  \u2018stimulating entrepreneurship may \nprovide a promising means of increasing job creation and boosting the economy, without \ndistorting market forces\u2019. The OECD belief that governments should foster and support \nentrepreneurship has not changed since then. A more recent report (OECD, 2004) states that,  \n\u201cEntrepreneurship is considered key to economic performance, in particular with respect to innovative \nchange, playing an important structural role in all economies. Encouraging entrepreneurship is \nincreasingly considered by governments as an effective mean of: i) creating jobs; ii) increasing \nproductivity and competitiveness; and iii) alleviating poverty and achieving societal goals, in particular \nby helping specific population groups to help themselves\u201d (p. 5). \n \nThe OECD is not an exception in this respect. Recently the World Bank issued a full report on \nthe impact of regulations on economic growth: Doing Business in 2006 (The World Bank, \n2005).  The report mentions that \u201cJobs are a priority for every country, and specially  poor \ncountries. Doing more to improve regulation and help entrepreneurs is key to creating more \n 19\njobs - and more growth. \u2026Women who make up three quarters of the work force in some \ndeveloping countries, will be the big beneficiaries\u2026\u201d(p. 1)  \n \nIn the U.S., the Small Business Administration (SBA), a government agency, has provided \nloan guarantees to small businesses since 1953. In 1997 Congress passed an SBA funding bill \nproviding over $50 billion for the SBA\u2019s business loan programs11.  \n \nIt is not just the U.S. government that shares the view that it is desirable that more people set \nup new businesses: most governments do. For example, in 2002 the U.K. Government \nannounced \u201cA new drive to boost the enterprise culture, encourage more people to set up their \nown business and reduce barriers facing start-up firms\u2026particularly [amongst] under-\nrepresented groups, such as women, ethnic minorities and [in] disadvantaged parts of the \ncountry\u201d (Department of Trade and Industry, 2002a).  \n \nGovernments\u2019 objectives have not only been to encourage entrepreneurship but, in several \ncountries, schemes have been set up to encourage the unemployed to become self-employed. \nParker (2004) mentions  that \u201cthe largest schemes have operated in the UK, France, Spain, \nGermany and Denmark\u201d (p. 254). \n \nIn 2003, the European Commission published a Green Paper on Entrepreneurship in Europe \n(European Commission, 2003), aimed at encouraging more people to become entrepreneurs. \nEntrepreneurship is seen as \u201cfirst and foremost a mindset\u201d (p.5). It is reported that \u201cAccess to \nfinance remains a major barrier for new entrepreneurs\u201d (p. 11) and schemes to overcome this, \nsuch as the UK Government\u2019s Loan Guarantee Scheme to small businesses - set to back some \n5000 loans per year, targeted towards borrowers that banks would otherwise have rejected \n(Department of Trade and Industry, 2002b) - are praised. The European Social Fund - \nEuropean Union Promoting employment opportunities for all, in its objective 3, policy field 4, \nalso stresses the importance and need to increase levels of entrepreneurship (European Social \nFund, 2005) \n                                                 \n11\n In addition the Community Reinvestment Act provides banks with incentives for lending to small businesses in \nlow-income areas.  \n 20\n \nPolicies of this sort reflect a view that namely \u201c\u2026lack of capital holds back millions of \npotentially entrepreneurial people in the industrial countries\u201d (Blanchflower, Oswald, & \nStutzer, 2001, p. 690). \n \nGiven the view of under-lending, current standard economic theory provides a justification for \nthe types of policies outlined above and for intervention on efficiency grounds. Part of the \nattraction of policies based on standard economic theory is that if designed to bring excluded \ngroups into the market they are likely to yield distributional as well as efficiency gains. \nHowever, all the policies described put psychology aside and if optimistic expectations replace \nrational expectations, the policy conclusions may change.  \n \nIndeed, it may well be the case that entrepreneurs wanting loans but failing to obtain them will \nbe better off than those receiving them (Coelho, 2004). The issue is particularly poignant in the \ncase of minority and disadvantaged groups. Consequently, policies directed towards increasing \nlending, in particular those focused on excluded borrowers, such as loan guarantee schemes, \nmay be particularly harmful (M. P. Coelho, de Meza, & Reyniers, 2004). The same is true of \nbankruptcy laws which neglect that they are ruling a population of over-optimistic \nentrepreneurs. \u201cMost countries operate under some form of bankruptcy law that limit borrower \nliability\u201d (Lilienfeld-Toal & Mookherjee, 2005), p 1). In most countries bankruptcy laws are \ndesigned in a way that increases the life span of struggling firms and in so doing they are \nsimply increasing the chances that entrepreneurs will follow a real road to ruin.  \n \nThe bulk of public economics analyses the welfare implications of fiscal policy, and other \npublic interventions, under the assumption that people make decisions in their own best \ninterests. Hence the justification for policy is distributional or to counteract externalities. To \nsuggest that public policy should combat self-delusion (with paternalistic policies, for \nexample) is a good deal more controversial. The evidence reported here suggests the problem \ncannot be sidestepped, however,  by supposing that misperceptions are minor and random, and \nimplies that governments need to take them into account when framing policy. \n \n 21\nOnly recently has there been sustained discussion of the normative implications of self-harm, \nand of mechanisms to discourage it (see e.g. (O'Donoghue & Rabin, 1999); (Camerer, \nIssacharoff, Loewenstein, O'Donoghue, & Rabin, 2003); (Thaler & Sunstein, 2003b); (Thaler \n& Sunstein, 2003a, 2003b)). There is agreement that behavioural economics documents \ncommon mistakes, but that those mistakes are far from universal. There is therefore concern \nthat paternalistic policies may impose undue burdens on those people who behave rationally in \nparticular situations. There is also agreement that behavioural economics is in an early stage of \ndevelopment, and so its findings should elicit more caution than those from more \u201cmature\u201d \nfields. These and related concerns suggest caution in promoting paternalistic policies at this \nstage, and lead to more conservative notions of paternalistic interventions. \n \n\u201cCautious paternalism\u201d has been defended by O\u2019Donoghue and Rabin (1999); \u201cAsymmetric \npaternalism\u201d explored by Camerer et al (2003), and Thaler and Sunstein (2003a, 2003b) have \nproposed \u201cLibertarian paternalism\u201d. While these approaches differ slightly, all of them are \nbounded by concern regarding heavy-handed paternalism and focus on minimally \ninterventionist policies. They are aimed at finding policies that help people who make errors \nwhile having little effect on those who are (fully) rational.  \n \nExamples of such policies are the provision or re-framing of information, and establishing \ncooling off-periods.  \n \nProvision of information refers to simple education; training programs developed to help \nentrepreneurs identify whether their business ideas are viable. For example, \u201cLessons learned\u201d \nvignettes could be put together by people who have tried and failed and tried and succeeded to \nidentify \u201cwhat works\u201d in terms of starting a new business in a particular domain12. Lessons on \nwhat  entrepreneurs might not be able to control should also be highlighted. These training \nsessions should go hand in hand with an entrepreneurs\u2019 work life and not be restricted to the \nbeginning of their activities. As mentioned above, implemental mindsets seem to trigger higher \nlevels of over-optimism and, therefore, sessions aimed at refocusing mindsets should be \nwelcomed  \n                                                 \n12\n I would like to thank the excellent comments and suggestions of one of the referees . \n 22\n \nRe-framing of information refers to framing a situation in a subtlly different way that would \nnot be relevant from the perspective of  standard economic theory but which can have large \neffects on behaviour. For example, legal authorities could provide potential entrepreneurs with \ninformation such as failure rates (instead of success rates) and average annual payoff (in the \nsame industry and overall) and inform them, in detail, of the potential consequences of a \nbankruptcy.  \n \nCooling off-periods refer to the fact that when people are in emotionally or biologically \nsensitive situations, they sometimes make decisions that are costly or even impossible to \nreverse. Behavioural economists have suggested a variety of reasons why people might \nrespond to \u201chot states\u201d in suboptimal ways. For example, if the current hot state of mind is a \nreal source of well being people tend to overestimate how long it will last, and to underestimate \njust how differently they will feel in the \u201ccold state\u201d. Let us assume that a company was not \nable to pay salaries for three months in the last  year, the default rule could be that it will shut \nbusiness in the next \u201cx\u201d months, but that this can be reversed during the cooling-off period.  \n \nIn many situations peoples\u2019 choices are suboptimal, and changing the default rule, providing \ninformation, or letting them reassess their choices for a few days, does not counteract the errors \nthey make. In such cases a more intrusive policy than the ones already mentioned, may need to \nbe imposed in order to help them. Imposing a deadline\/dates for decisions to be made (for \nexample, fixing a time for closure after the occurrence of certain events) as a means to combat \nprocrastination is an example of such a policy.  \n \nMore recently O\u2019Donoghue and Rabin (2003) proposed a different approach - \u201cOptimal \npaternalism\u201d \u2013 which follows from standard assumptions and methods of economic theory and \nwhich seems to suggest that heavy-handed paternalism should be implemented in cases where \n(behavioural) economic models suggest it would promote more efficient outcomes. If it can be \nestablished that, given certain market conditions, there is a relatively high probability of failure \nof a specific business, people should be discouraged from starting a business. Another example \ncould be setting a policy that after failing once (twice, etc.) in a business, second -time \nentrepreneurs would have to pay a proportional tax to start a new business.  \n 23\n \nPartly as a reaction to the controversy of paternalistic policies, some will claim that \nentrepreneurs learn from their own mistakes. Indeed, learning occurs frequently and enables \npeople to overcome their own limitations. However, entrepreneurial decisions (e.g. starting a \nbusiness or closing it down), which potentially have significant financial implications, are \nmade infrequently. Opportunities for learning are therefore insufficient to ensure that people\u2019s \ndecisions will help them protect their welfare, more than decisions taken by third parties \nwould.  \n \nOthers may argue that accurate information being given to entrepreneurs is bound to have \nlimited impact: the cognitive bias that leads non-rational subjects to make wrong decisions will \nquite likely make them immune to education, and ignore the \u201cwarnings\u201d being issued whilst \nthe impact on rational subjects will be minimal. However, this does not seem to be a reason to \ndismiss interventions altogether, especially given that the costs of issuing that information do \nnot seem to be representative.  \n \nIt is true that people sometimes respond to their own bounded rationality, for example, by \nhiring agents or by delegating decisions to others. These sorts of actions could be encouraged \nwith the aim of counteracting entrepreneurs\u2019 optimistic views of the future. However, such \nencouragement has three natural risks: (1) external advisors may also be prone to optimism, (2) \nthe self-interest of external advisors (agents) may lead them not to act in the entrepreneurs\u2019 \n(principals\u2019) best interest, and (3) even if the previous risks are overcome, there is evidence \nthat over-optimistic entrepreneurs are not easily diverted from the course of action they believe \nis the best one to take, and so, given the usually relatively high costs of hiring external \nadvisors, entrepreneurs may face a net loss from doing so. Indeed, it should be stressed that \nmany of the most important decisions people make (like starting a business) are made \ninfrequently, and typically without the aid of impartial experts (Thaler & Sunstein, 2003b p. \n13; \u00c5stebro, 2003, p. 237).  \n \n \n 24\n5. Conclusions \n \nStandard economic theory assumes that we live in a world of people with rational expectations \nwho always act in their best interest, and therefore self-select themselves efficiently into \nactivities. There is a great deal of psychological evidence, however, that unrealistic optimism is \nwidespread, and it would be surprising if economic decisions were immune to these biases.  \n \nLittle research has been carried out on the implications of  optimistic biases in economic and \nmanagerial decisions, and that which has been undertaken is based on a relatively poor \nunderstanding of such biases.  This paper has sought to present a comprehensive account of the \npsychology of unrealistic optimism in general, and of the psychology of entrepreneurial \noptimism in particular.  \n \nUnrealistic optimism, as well as other identifiable cognitive biases, create distortions which \nmay be the most important source of efficiency loss in the economic system. Currently, when \ndesigning policy, governments ignore this fact. For example, entrepreneurship is widely \nregarded as a key instrument for employment and growth, and yet certain policy decisions \nignore that entrepreneurs suffer from positive illusions when planning and implementing their \nventures and that these illusions can have significant negative consequences. The current \npolicy is to encourage business star-ups even in light of clear warnings. It is urgent that public \npolicy seriously takes these distortions on board. \n \nEntrepreneurs\u2019 unrealistic optimism should not be sidestepped since it provides justification for  \noffering less public encouragement to entrepreneurship or seriously considering paternalistic \npolicies. The issue is particularly poignant in the case of minority and disadvantaged groups. \nPolicy makers are generally particularly keen for finance to be channelled to such groups, but \nevidence shows that doing so may create a real road to ruin.  \n \nWe have not tried to judge whether start-ups confer positive externalities. Rather, we have \nconcentrated on entrepreneurs\u2019 \u201cinternalities\u201d (i.e., entrepreneurs\u2019 financial losses and \nopportunity costs). To the extent that these positive externalities exist, there is an argument for \n 25\nsubsidizing business start-ups even if unrealistic optimism is also present. However, in \nevaluating the case of whether new businesses are a good thing in themselves, at least two \nnotes of caution should be taken on board. A common argument, made for example in the EC \nGreen Paper, is that most new jobs are created in start-ups. This is true, but because start-ups \nso often fail, a year or two down the line they are also responsible for destroying more jobs \nthan established firms - and the negative consequences, including the opportunity and \npsychological costs for start-up employees and their families, should not be overlooked. \nSecondly, the failure of a business is generally bad news for customers, suppliers and financial \ninstitutions, negative externalities that are often ignored.   \n \nPeople are not consistently realistic or unrealistic, they vary according to the situation they \nface. Therefore, there is no \u201cstable\u201d list of individual differences which could help us identify \nwho are the unrealistic optimistic types. As a consequence, the screening of those \nentrepreneurs who would be at highest risk of failure in their business ventures is not possible \nto do at this stage. Developments in neuroscience may well help us understand UO in more \ndepth and carry out such  screening in future, which would be very helpful, namely for policy \npurposes. \n \nThe main question is therefore whether governments should intervene with paternalistic \npolicies aimed at reducing the errors made by unrealistically optimistic entrepreneurs but \nwhich would not affect decisions made by other types of entrepreneurs. We are sympathetic to \nsome of the arguments that paternalistic policies have some undesirable effects; namely, fears \nof regulatory capture or regulatory incompetence, transaction costs in implementation, and \nrespect for people\u2019s freedom of choice are important concerns. However, we believe (as do \nother \u201cpaternalists\u201d) that the seriousness of the errors people make imply that rather than \nloosely evoke these concerns as a reason for the blanket rejection of paternalistic policies, we \nshould carefully articulate and investigate them. \n \n \n 26\n \nArabsheibani, G., de Meza, D., Maloney, J., & Pearson, B.
