We pay particular attention to the way newspapers represent the \nfactors that facilitate or hinder effective HIV\/AIDS management, as well as their \ndepiction of the role of communities in tackling the epidemic.  \n \nOur starting point is a wider interest in why there is so little effective community \ninvolvement in so many HIV\/AIDS programmes in South Africa. In the academic \nliterature, there is increasingly widespread acceptance that one reason for the \ndisappointing outcomes of so many HIV\/AIDS interventions is their failure to \nresonate with the perceived needs and interests of their target communities. \nThere is also widespread recognition that meaningful community involvement is \nvital if prevention, care and treatment efforts are to have optimal outcomes. \n(Barnett & Whiteside, 2006; Campbell, 2003; Campbell, Nair et al., 2007; Gruber \n& Caffrey, 2005).  \n \nThis insight is accommodated in HIV\/AIDS policy documents at the international, \nnational and regional levels, which repeatedly call for the mobilisation of \ngrassroots communities to participate in the design and implementation of AIDS \nefforts (Goetz & Gaventa, 2001; UNAIDS, 2006; African Union, 2007; \nDepartment of Health, 2007). They also emphasise the importance of building \npartnerships between communities and AIDS-relevant agencies in the public and \nprivate sectors and civil society (UNAIDS, 2006). However, such policies are \noften not translated into practice. The community involvement that does exist is \noften tokenistic and shallow. Communities are called upon to \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 \nprogrammes imported from the outside, and partnerships between communities \nand outside agencies are often hampered by poor agency commitment to \ncommunity outreach activities (Campbell, 2003; Nair & Campbell, 2008). \n \n 4 \nThere are many reasons for the exclusion of communities from effective \ninvolvement in many dimensions of South Africa\u2019s AIDS struggle. Elsewhere we \nhave characterised the social environments in which HIV\/AIDS programmes are \nconducted in terms of three dimensions: the material, the institutional and the \nsymbolic (Campbell, Foulis, Maimane & Sibiya, 2005). From a material \nperspective, overworked government departments are swamped with competing \ndemands in the face of limited human resources and budget constraints \n(McIntyre & Klugman, 2003). Many NGOs rely on foreign funding, and are forced \nto tailor their goals to externally imposed frameworks rather than to local \nconditions (Eyben, 2006). From an institutional point of view health and \ndevelopment agencies are often characterised by rigid and hierarchical working \nstructures and practices, as well as bureaucratic \u2018red tape\u2019, which limits their \nability to respond flexibly to local community needs. Furthermore many agency \nstaff lack social development training in areas such as community liaison and \ncommunity development (Eyben, 2006; Nair & Campbell, 2008). Such material \nand institutional imperatives play out within a symbolic field that lacks \nrepresentations of grassroots community members as competent social actors \nwith a key role to play in health and social development efforts. The symbolic \ndimension is the focus of the current paper, which examines media \nrepresentations of HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa. \n \nConceptual framework \nThis paper draws on a social psychological reading of Habermas\u2019 notion of the \npublic sphere (Habermas, 1989; Jovchelovitch, 2006). The public sphere refers \nto the social spaces in which members of a society negotiate the social \nrepresentations or discourses that dominate in a particular society. Social \nrepresentations are the symbolic tools that are available to members of a society \nfor making sense of the world, and for formulating action plans on the basis of \nthese implicit understandings. Access to the public sphere is unequal, so the \nrepresentations that are sustained there reflect larger patterns of power and \ninequality (Parker, 2005; Jovchelovitch, 2006).  \n 5 \n \nThe media play a key role in shaping the social representations that circulate in \nthe public sphere (Moscovici, 1961; Gillwald, 1993; Thompson, 1995). They \nserve as a key arena in which ideas about social problems and challenges are \ndiscussed and debated (Parker & Kelly, 2001). Certain dominant representations \nof HIV\/AIDS management are sustained in the public sphere, supporting the \nconstruction of certain ideological understandings of HIV\/AIDS and shaping \nresponses to it (Parker, 2005). Against this background, we look at newspapers\u2019 \nrepresentations of HIV\/AIDS management and the role of communities in this \nprocess, in the interests of throwing light on the symbolic context in which AIDS-\nrelevant actors \u2013 such as government officials, NGOs, community organisations, \nbusiness philanthropists and individuals \u2013 come to understand what effective \nHIV\/AIDS management can and should look like at a local level. \n \nThe public sphere can be conceptualised as a tapestry, with many interwoven \nthreads contributing to its dominant representations. Clearly there are many other \nspaces constructing a public sphere \u2013 not least the television, the talk and \nspeeches of politicians, literature and the radio. In this research we have chosen \nto focus on the contribution made by newspapers in shaping dominant \nrepresentations of HIV\/AIDS management. We do so because South African \nnewspapers have, since the apartheid era, a particular history of providing \ndiverse perspectives, being proactive in debate and being socially engaged \n(Parker & Kelly, 2001). As such they provide an insight into many of the debates \nand contradictions circulating in the broader public sphere.  \n \nExisting empirical research on HIV in newspapers in South Africa \nFocusing on the media in HIV\/AIDS social research is a necessary imperative, \ngiven that \u201cthe vast body of information that informs social discourse on \nHIV\/AIDS exists largely outside of the framework of intentional campaigns and \ninterventions, and that proportionally, much of this information is located within \nthe news media.\u201d (Kelly & Parker, 2001, p. 2). A nationally representative South \n 6 \nAfrican survey points out that whilst most people get information on HIV\/AIDS \nfrom radio and television, about half of those aged 15 to 49 use newspapers as \nan important additional source of information on HIV\/AIDS, and these include \ndecision makers, health practitioners and activists (HSRC, 2005).  \n \nCommunication for development and communication for behaviour change have \nbecome increasingly researched areas of HIV\/AIDS management (Ford, Odallo \n& Chorlton, 2003; Beckett & Kyrke-Smith, 2007). Kelly and Parker (2001) \ncomment that current research on the media and HIV\/AIDS has tended to focus \non empirical analyses of the quantity of reporting. For example, Media Tenor \n(2006) point out that less that 1 percent of all reports from leading media outlets \n(both television and newspapers) focus on HIV\/AIDS, and that the majority of \nthese reports focus on \u2018media spectacles\u2019 \u2013 high profile, exciting stories, focusing \non well known individuals.  \n \nRecent international scholarship on the media and health highlights the way in \nwhich the media mediates and partially constructs people\u2019s understandings of \nhealth and health related issues (Hodgetts & Chamberlain, 2006). This has been \nparticularly true of the HIV\/AIDS pandemic, which emerged parallel to the \nglobalising and strengthening of the media. Studies of the media and HIV\/AIDS \nhave identified the central role it has played in shaping representations of \nHIV\/AIDS and risk-groups. In Australia for example, Lupton (1993) argues that \nmedia reports were central in the late 1980s in repositioning HIV\/AIDS from a \n\u2018risk-issue\u2019 only for homosexuals to a \u2018risk-issue\u2019 for heterosexuals as well.  \n \nLittle similar work has focused on representations of HIV\/AIDS in the media in \nSouth Africa. Exceptions include Connelly and McLeod\u2019s (2003) study of an \nEastern Cape Province newspaper. They show how the newspaper constructs \nrepresentations of HIV\/AIDS management in terms of war and warfare. They \nshow how framing HIV\/AIDS in terms of warfare allows government and medical \nvoices to dominate newspaper coverage of HIV\/AIDS. This results in the \n 7 \nsilencing of lay voices, despite the very significant role played by lay people in \nshouldering the HIV\/AIDS burden in South Africa. (Connelly & McLeod, 2003) \n \nA second study by Meintjies and Bray (2005) explores representations of \norphans and vulnerable children in national newspapers in South Africa. Such \nrepresentations, they argue, are crucial for understanding how the general \npopulation comes to understand the impact of HIV\/AIDS on orphans and \nvulnerable children. They point out that these representations are bound up in a \n\u201cseries of moral judgements about who is and who is not performing appropriate \nroles in relation to children.\u201d (Meintjies & Bray, 2005, p. 155).  Representations, \nin other words, are important for shaping people\u2019s symbolic understandings of \nHIV\/AIDS and therefore how they respond to HIV\/AIDS.  \n  \nMethodology \n \nNewspaper selection \n \nFour English language newspapers were purposively selected to access a broad \nrange of representations. While recognising that there are eleven official \nlanguages in South Africa, and the limitations this implies for this paper, English \nis the primary language of business and government and is taught in all schools.  \n \nThe Mail and Guardian is a weekly paper, with the highest proportion of \nHIV\/AIDS stories (2.76 percent) in any South African newspaper (Media Tenor, \n2006). It is widely seen as an elite newspaper, with a reputation for agenda-\nsetting. A second weekly, the Sunday Times, was also selected, because it has \nthe largest circulation in the country. Its estimated readership is 3.24 million, with \nits growing black readership standing at an estimated 55 percent of this number \n(The Times, 2007). It also has a reputation of being agenda-setting \u2013 but carries \na smaller percentage of HIV\/AIDS-related stories, only 0.97 percent (Media \nTenor, 2006).  \n 8 \n \nTwo daily newspapers were also included in our data set. The Johannesburg-\nbased Sowetan is an English language newspaper, aimed predominantly at a \ngrowing black middle-class. It has the largest percentage of HIV\/AIDS-related \nstories of all the dailies, at 1.19 percent (Media Tenor, 2006). The second daily \npaper was Business Day, aimed at the business sector. Whilst it had a relatively \nlow level of HIV\/AIDS stories \u2013 0.74 percent (Media Tenor, 2006) - it was \nincluded because it was the first mainstream business sector daily newspaper \nand because of its predominantly private sector readership, in a context where \nprivate sector is increasingly being identified as a key partner in AIDS \nmanagement (UNAIDS, 2006). The diverse amount of reporting on HIV\/AIDS \nfrom the four newspapers reflects broader media trends and our data set picks \nup those with larger than average and those with less than average amounts of \nreporting (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Newspapers\u2019 reporting of HIV\/AIDS stories as percentage of all stories, \nbetween October 2004 and September 2006 (Media Tenor, 2006) \n \nMedia Outlet Percentage HIV\/AIDS Articles \nAverage all leading SA media < 1  \nMail and Guardian 2.76 \nSunday Times 0.97 \nSowetan 1.19 \nBusiness Day 0.74 \n \n \nContent analysis \nThe four newspapers were sampled between 1st May 2006 and 1st May 2007, \nusing the electronic media clipping service SA Media. Initially we searched for all \narticles including the term \u2018AIDS\u2019. This elicited a total of 393 articles that had \n 9 \neither been tagged with \u2018AIDS\u2019 as a subject, or else had \u2018AIDS\u2019 in the title of the \narticle.  \n \nA second manual search narrowed these articles to those focusing on South \nAfrica (or southern Africa, or sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 if related to South Africa) and \nto those which tackled issues related to the broadest understanding of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement, with particular reference to factors facilitating or hindering effective \nmanagement. We used a very loose definition of HIV\/AIDS management to \ninclude any reference to issues bearing on any aspect of HIV\/AIDS-related \ntreatment, care, support, prevention, leadership or policies. This led to a final \ndata corpus of 247 articles.  \n \nThese were analysed using Attride-Stirling\u2019s (2000) method of thematic content \nanalysis. In line with our interest in media representations of factors facilitating or \nhindering effective HIV\/AIDS management, and the role of communities in \ntackling the epidemic, we coded articles in three stages.  The first stage involved \nclustering articles under three umbrella categories which emerged from our initial \nreading:  \n1. Health systems and costs;  \n2. Government and leadership; and \n3. \u2018Effective\u2019 HIV\/AIDS programmes. \n \nIn the second stage of analysis, these global themes were refined into more \ndetailed sub-themes to provide a more elaborated analysis. The sub-themes \nfalling under each global theme are listed in Table 2. Definitions of each sub-\ntheme are included in the discussion of findings in the next section of the paper. \nIn both these stages of analysis we were guided by a \u2018grounded theory\u2019 \napproach, deriving the global themes and sub-themes from the data themselves \n(rather than subjecting the articles to a coding frame formulated prior to the \nanalysis).  \n \n 10 \nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE PLEASE \n \nNo article was classified under more than one global theme and sub-theme. In \ngeneral, articles tended to fall clearly into particular categories. In cases where \narticles contained material relating to more than one global theme or sub-theme, \nwe categorised them according what we considered to be the \u2018primary theme\u2019 of \nthe article \u2013 the theme that received the greatest prominence in the article\u2019s \nheadline and opening paragraphs. \n \nOnce this basic content sorting had been completed, a more interpretative third \nstage of analysis sought to examine the way in which community involvement \nwas conceptualised within each of the global themes and sub-themes. Findings \nfrom all three stages are reported below.  \n \nFindings and discussion \nWe examine the representations embodied in articles categorised within each of \nthe three global themes in turn. Under each global theme we explore the \nassociated sub-themes, highlighting what were represented as the barriers and \nfacilitators of HIV\/AIDS management in the context of each sub-theme. We then \nexamine how community involvement in HIV\/AIDS management is positioned in \nthe context of each sub-theme under scrutiny.  \n \nHealth systems and costs \nArticles classified under this global theme focused on the formal health services \nand the costs of providing HIV\/AIDS treatment, care and prevention through \nthese services. Articles were further classified into four sub-themes (\u2018human \nresources\u2019, \u2018red-tape\u2019, \u2018reform of the health system\u2019 and \u2018costs\u2019), with each sub-\ntheme emphasising different aspects of the challenges of healthcare provision in \nSouth Africa. \n \nHuman resources \n 11 \nThe sub-theme \u2018human resources\u2019 focused on how the lack of skilled \nprofessionals \u2013 doctors, nurses and managers \u2013 served as a barrier to HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement. All newspapers reported on the \u2018African Brain Drain\u2019 (Mail and \nGuardian, 2006-09-07), with nurses and doctors leaving to work abroad.  Articles \nreported on how this impacted negatively on HIV\/AIDS care and treatment:  \n \n\u201cA brain drain in the medical fraternity is harming the battle against HIV-\nAIDS in northern KwaZulu-Natal.\u201d (Sowetan, 2006-06-14) \n \nThe Sowetan went on to report that doctors and nurses were unwilling to work in \nrural areas and often left the country for jobs with better pay and service \nconditions. The lack of trained doctors and nurses undermined the rollout of Anti-\nRetroviral therapy (ARVs) through government facilities: \n \n\u201cWe can\u2019t expand much faster. We have a very intensive programme and \nface limitations of staff and space\u201d, adds Dr. Liz Floyd [Head of Gauteng \nProvince Multi-Sectoral AIDS Unit]. (Sunday Times, 2006-11-26) \n \nAs well as limiting HIV\/AIDS care and treatment, broader human resource \nissues, such as the lack of skilled managers in the health system, were seen as \nbarriers to the effective implementation of HIV\/AIDS policies: \n  \nAlthough many of SA\u2019s health policies looked good on paper, staff \nshortages and lack of managerial experience meant programmes were \noften poorly implemented, said Saloojee [Prof in Paediatrics and Child \nHealth]. (Business Day, 2006-12-01) \n \nThe focus on human resources recognised the multiplicity of factors \u2013 including \nboth push and pull factors \u2013 that shaped the human resource \u2018crisis\u2019 in South \nAfrica. This was closely tied to the perceived failure of implementation of health \nand HIV\/AIDS policies. However these discussions tended to focus narrowly on \n 12 \npersonnel linked to formal medical and clinical settings, ignoring how human \nresource constraints may limit other important areas of HIV\/AIDS management, \nsuch as the Department of Welfare. \n \nRed tape \n\u2018Red tape\u2019 was the second sub-theme under the global theme \u2018health systems \nand costs\u2019, highlighting how red tape impacted on patients\u2019 access to healthcare \nservices. Under the strap-line \u201cRed tape puts lives at risk\u201d Business Day reported \nthat regulations were stopping Provincial governments from accrediting new \nantiretroviral sites: \n \n\u201cHassan [of the AIDS Law Project] said the national health department\u2019s \nrequirement for provincial treatment facilities to be inspected by national \noffice officials was causing needless delays in accrediting new sites.\u201d \n(Business Day, 2006-11-29) \n \nIn addition \u2018red-tape\u2019 was associated with the extraordinary conditions required \nfor HIV\/AIDS testing. These allegedly increased the stigma of Voluntary \nCounselling and Testing (VCT) for HIV\/AIDS through demarcating HIV\/AIDS \ntesting as exceptional and different compared to testing for other health \nproblems. This focus was sparked by a speech by Judge Edwin Cameron, a well-\nknown AIDS-activist, in which he argued that the repeated use of pre- and post-\ntest counselling was overly bureaucratic: \n \nEthical guidelines currently enforced by the courts demand that anyone \nhaving an HIV-test must receive both pre- and post-test counselling, and \ngive explicit consent\u2026But [Judge Edwin] Cameron argued that the special \nconditions around HIV-testing reinforce stigma and discourage many \npeople diagnosed with AIDS from receiving treatment. (Mail and Guardian, \n2006-05-18) \n \n 13 \nReports represented the accessibility of health services as limited by too many or \noverly complicated rules. The implied solution to service accessibility was to \nchange these rules. Framing access to health services in this way minimises \nbroader and deeper understandings of factors shaping access, such as stigma \nand financial barriers, both of which are particularly important around HIV\/AIDS \ncare, treatment and prevention (Castro & Farmer, 2005; Campbell, Nair, \nMaimane & Nicholson, 2007). Occasionally more nuanced understandings of \nthese issues were seen in reports, but these were in the minority. One Business \nDay article on the decentralisation of the provision of ARVs to local clinics in the \nEastern Cape \u2013 a crucial factor in promoting access to treatment \u2013 highlighted \nthe complexities undermining access to health care: \n \nEvery single weekend I have spent in Lusikisiki\u2019s villages I have either \nattended a funeral of a young person or been told of a young person who \nlived within a stone\u2019s throw of treatment and never set foot in a clinic. \nPeople are still dying of stigma. (Business Day, 2006-10-30) \n \nReform of the health system \n\u2018Reform of the health system\u2019, was the third sub-theme to emerge from these \narticles. The challenge of reforming the unequal apartheid health care system, \ninto one that is inclusive of all, has been a major challenge for the post-apartheid \ngovernment (Benatar, 2004). Media stories tended to view health care systems \nreform as a vital strategy to prevent the wastage of money and to enable \ncomprehensive treatment for HIV\/AIDS: \n  \nWhile there had been significant healthcare-related investments from \npublic and private sector organisations in the past five years to combat \ninfectious diseases, these funds could not be used effectively without \nproper health-care systems, said GHI [Global Health Initiative] director \nFrancesca Boldrini. \u201cSystems are not \u2018sexy\u2019 things to talk about but they \n 14 \nare what make things work. If we don\u2019t focus on that, we will never make a \ndifference,\u201d she said. (Business Day, 2006-06-02) \n \nAnother report cited the Health Minister making a similar point in relation to the \nprovision of effective drug therapy: \n \nShe [Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang] said the measurement \nof viral loads and constant monitoring required for AIDS patients was \ndifficult to implement in developing countries that did not have a basic \nhealth-care system in place. (Business Day, 2006-06-13) \n \nIn short, the reform of the healthcare system was generally regarded as the \ncentral issue for enabling more effective HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa. \n \nCosts \nThe final sub-theme in this section was \u2018costs\u2019, emphasising financial costs as \nthe key barrier to HIV\/AIDS management. This emphasis was particularly evident \nin discussions of ARV treatment, depicted as an expensive burden for the \ngovernment \u2013 a topic which received particular attention from Business Day (see \nTable 2). The Mail and Guardian stressed that emerging resistance to \u2018first-line\u2019 \nARVs would mean more expensive \u2018second-line\u2019 treatment: \n \nThe medical humanitarian organisation, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), \ncontinues to be the lone voice sounding the alarm about the cost and \navailability of newer Aids medicines in developing countries\u2026At an MSF-\nsupported programme in Khayelitsha, 16% of patients need to switch to \nsecond-line drugs after four years and it costs five times more than first-\nline regimens. (Mail and Guardian, 2006-08-24) \n \nThe issue of the cost of ARV treatment became a particularly prominent theme \nonce the National Strategic Plan on HIV\/AIDS and STDs 2005-2011 (Department \n 15 \nof Health, 2007) became a viable reality, emphasising comprehensive treatment \nwith ARVs. Under the headline \u201cState faces dilemma of R45bn AIDS\u2019 drugs cost\u201d, \nBusiness Day highlighted the increasing cost of the National Strategic Plan \n(NSP) as a key issue for government.  \n \n\u201cThe high cost of the [NSP] plan will raise difficult questions for \ngovernment about whether it is affordable and sustainable, and to what \nextent it should bankroll the strategy itself. Government has already \nbudgeted R14bn for HIV\/AIDS spending over the next three years, but the \nnew plan will require significantly more money.\u201d (Business Day, 2007-03-\n13) \n \nLater in the year an article in Business Day made a direct link between the cost \nof the NSP and ARVs: \n \nAnti-HIV medicines are a key cost driver in the government\u2019s draft five-\nyear AIDS plan, accounting for about 40% of its R45bn price tag. \n(Business Day, 2007-04-25) \n \nThis sub-theme of \u2018costs\u2019 emphasised adequate financing as a pre-condition for \nHIV\/AIDS management in South Africa, focusing heavily on the cost of ARVs. \nThis relatively negative focus ignored numerous cost-benefit analyses that have \nsuggested the provision of ARVs in the public sector is a cost-saving treatment \nstrategy in the long-run (Nattrass, 2004). Furthermore the tendency to focus \nsolely on ARVs represented a narrow understanding of the NSP as a medical \nplan, rather than acknowledging its more holistic focus on the integration of \ntreatment, care and prevention.  \n \nThe global-theme of \u2018health systems and costs\u2019 and its four associated sub-\nthemes sustained a series of inter-related representations of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement, which have implications for our interest in community involvement.  \n 16 \n \nFirst, HIV\/AIDS management was represented as a strictly medical phenomenon \n\u2013 supporting a narrow representation of health systems as hospitals, clinics and \nARV treatment. This ignored the tremendous amount of work done in many \ncommunities by individuals, families and small groups in providing healthcare \nand support to people living with HIV\/AIDS outside of the formal medical health \nsystem, such as home-based care, for example (Maimane, Campbell, Nair & \nSibiya, 2004; Campbell, Nair, Maimane & Sibiya, 2008). In addition, when \ndiscussing human resources constraints, the focus was on the lack of doctors, \nnurses and health managers, again sidelining human resource constraints \nexperienced in other departments, such as the Department of Welfare, crucial for \nHIV\/AIDS management (Nair & Campbell, 2008). Furthermore discussions of the \ncosts of implementing the NSP focused on the cost of ARV treatment, without \nconsidering the wider resources demands of the NSP. As such this global theme \nsustained a representation that HIV\/AIDS management was the domain of \nmedicine.   \n \nSecondly the solution to the challenges of HIV\/AIDS management were typically \ndepicted in terms of issues such as changing policies, reforming the workings of \nthe formal health system and spending more money. There was little \nconsideration in newspapers of how such actions would be translated into \npractice. In this regard the District Health level is crucial for understanding how \nHIV\/AIDS management policy at a national level is turned into practice in South \nAfrica. Yet newspapers were primarily concerned with barriers and facilitators at \nthe national level and did not explore how policies and rules were translated at \ndifferent levels of government.  \n \nIn addition, while health policy in South Africa and internationally has \nemphasised the need for health systems to be responsive to service-users to \ncreate more effective health systems (Goetz & Gaventa, 2001; African Union, \n2007; Department of Health, 2007), few newspaper reports explored this. As \n 17 \nsuch, the voices of those actually experiencing and engaging with health systems \n\u2013 such as patients and their carers \u2013 were effectively marginalised through the \nway newspapers reported these storiesi. \n \nGovernment and leadership \nThe global-theme of \u2018government and leadership\u2019 was a particularly important \none, with 32 percent of all articles classified within this category. Newspapers \noften made strong and explicit claims that the main barriers to effective HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement in South Africa were located within government. This may partly be \nthe result of newspaper reliance on government sources for stories (Finlay, \n2004), but also demonstrates that newspapers do recognise that there is a \npolitical aspect to HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa. Three sub-themes \nemerged in our exploration of this global theme: \u2018individuals in government\u2019, \u2018role \nmodelling behaviour\u2019 and \u2018government bureaucracy\u2019.  \n \nIndividuals in government \nThe sub-theme of \u2018individuals in government\u2019 comprised 16 percent of all articles \nacross the data set, and 21% of all articles in both the Sowetan and Sunday \nTimes. Newspaper reports often blamed individual government leaders for \nproblems with HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa \u2013 linking this either to lack \nof political will or lack of political leadership. This narrowly individualistic focus \nforeclosed a wider debate about what broader issues may be shaping \ngovernment policy. The Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, was the \nmain focus of this reporting, as a report in Business Day illustrates: \n \nMark Heywood, spokesman for the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) \nand director of the AIDS Law Project, said the TAC agreed that \ngovernment\u2019s operational plan released in 2003 was comprehensive. \n\u201cBut the problem is that it has not been implemented and that the Health \nMinister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, has continually frustrated the \n 18 \nimplementation of the plan by emphasising only certain parts of the plan, \nsuch as nutrition and traditional medicines.\u201d (Business Day, 2006-08-25) \n \nThe lack of political will to implement HIV\/AIDS policy was often linked to the \nHealth Minister\u2019s heterodox position on ARVs and her heavy emphasis on the \nnutrition of people living with AIDS. The Mail and Guardian reported that TAC \nactivists had called for her dismissal at the 2006 International AIDS Conference \nin Toronto: \n \nThe South African government stand [at the AIDS conference] \u2013 \ndecorated with lemons, beetroot and garlic linked to Health Minister Manto \nTshabalala-Msimang\u2019s aversion to anti-retroviral drugs \u2013 was invaded by \nthe Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) activists, some lying on the ground \nto symbolise South Africa\u2019s Aids dead. \u201cFire Manto now!\u201d they chanted to \npassers-by\u2026(Mail and Guardian, 2006-08-24) \n \nIn newspapers, political will was generally seen as the will to implement orthodox \nunderstandings of HIV\/AIDS management \u2013 and this was seen as the property of \nindividual government leaders. President Mbeki was also criticised for lacking \npolitical leadership, with such criticisms usually centring on his unwillingness to \nremove Health Minister Tshabalala-Msimang from her position. After the Toronto \nAIDS conference, an editorial in the Sunday Times called on President Mbeki to \nfire the Health Minister, because she was the block to implementing good South \nAfrican HIV\/AIDS policies: \n \nWhy Tshabalala-Msimang chose not to display her own government\u2019s \ncomprehensive plan for HIV\/AIDS treatment at the [International AIDS] \nconference boggles the mind. The silence by President Thabo Mbeki in \nthe face of the embarrassment dished out by Tshabalala-Msimang in \nToronto this week begs the question of whether he agrees with his Health \n 19 \nMinister. It is now time Mbeki took action against Tshabalala-Msimang. \n(Sunday Times, 2006-08-20) \n \nIn contrast, when the Health Minister fell ill in 2006 and was temporarily sidelined \nin HIV\/AIDS policy making, those who came to the fore \u2013 the Deputy President \nPhumzile Malambo-Ngcuka and the Deputy Minister of Health Nozizwe Madlala-\nRoutledge \u2013 were feted as heroes, and seen as having political will: \n \nNow, for the first time in seven years, there is hope. Political will on a \nsubstantial enough scale has been found. Deputy President Phumzile \nMalambo-Ngcuka has emerged as a genuine warrior in the fight against \nAIDS; with Deputy Health Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge and \nNomonde Xundu, the key anti-AIDS campaigners in the health \ndepartment, she is providing the leadership South Africa has lacked since \n1999, when President Thabo Mbeki first sowed confusion by labelling anti-\nretroviral drug therapy poison (Mail and Guardian, 2007-04-19) \n \nThere were additional rare examples of reports of strong leadership. Gauteng \nwas hailed as having strong political leadership, allowing a more progressive \nHIV\/AIDS policy to be implemented: \n \nGeneral Secretary of the Treatment Action Campaign, Sipho Mthati, says \nher organisation has found those implementing Gauteng\u2019s HIV\/AIDS \nprogramme to be highly motivated. \u201cThey are quite different from most \nother provinces, as they have strong political leadership\u201d, she adds.\u201d \n(Sunday Times, 2006-11-26) \n \nThis focus on senior government individuals resulted in effective HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement being seen as the outcome of individual whims. This leads to the \nneglect of broader political incentives shaping government behaviour around \nHIV\/AIDS management such as the need to win elections (de Waal, 2006). \n 20 \nRather a simple focus on villains, vilified as \u2018lunatics\u2019, or heroes, celebrated as \n\u2018warriors\u2019, created a simplistic narrative underpinning depictions of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement.  \n \nRole Modelling Behaviour \nThe second sub-theme was \u2018role modelling behaviour\u2019. This theme focused on \nthe individual behaviour of senior individuals within government and the South \nAfrican political system. They were viewed as role models, whose behaviours \nshaped the ways in which the ordinary South African understood and responded \nto HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nThis sub-theme included reports on the rape trial of ANC Deputy President Jacob \nZuma, who had sexual intercourse with a HIV-positive woman who later claimed \nthat she had been raped. In relation to the AIDS angle on this story, the central \nfocus in many articles was that even though Zuma knew the woman was HIV-\npositive he chose not to use a condom, claiming that he had protected himself \nfrom HIV infection by taking a shower after the sex. Cleared of rape, this broader \nissue elicited numerous comments, as a Sowetan columnist made clear: \n \n\u201cZuma did not use a condom while having sexual intercourse with an HIV-\npositive person. As a former head of the National AIDS Council, by doing \nthis Zuma has trampled on everything he, and we, have fought for in the \npast decades. There is no excuse. Zuma has damaged the nation, not just \nhimself.\u201d (Sowetan, 2006-05-08). \n \nA second report in the Sowetan two days later reported on how Zuma\u2019s actions \nhad sowed confusion amongst youngsters in the Eastern Cape: \n \nPortia Ngcaba, the TAC\u2019s Eastern Cape organiser, said yesterday Zuma \nshould be blamed for the belief among some school pupils that using a \ncondom during sex is not necessary to prevent HIV infection. \u201cMore than \n 21 \none pupil has asked us if showering is better than using a condom,\u201d said \nNgcaba\u2026\u201dIt is difficult to explain to young people that a shower does not \nhelp when a person with such power [as Zuma] did it and claims he does \nnot have HIV.\u201d (Sowetan, 2006-05-10) \n \nAnother \u2018role modelling\u2019 controversy erupted around whether government leaders \nshould undertake Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) for HIV\/AIDS, \nprecipitated after Deputy Minister Madlala-Routledge undertook a public \nHIV\/AIDS test, which was widely praised in the media: \n \nIn taking this hugely symbolic step [to have VCT], the deputy to \ncontroversial Health Minister Tshabalala-Msimang has chosen to lead by \nexample in the country\u2019s fight against HIV. (Sunday Times, 2006-11-26) \n \nEarlier in the year the Sunday Times had already emphasised that the failure of \nthe President and Health Minister to undertake VCT was a major issue for \nHIV\/AIDS management in South Africa: \n \nThe messages on testing and prevention would be less equivocal if they \ncame right from the top: if President Thabo Mbeki or Tshabalala-Msimang \nstopped by a clinic themselves to lead by example and test their status. \n(Sunday Times, 2006-11-05) \n \nThe sub-themes of \u2018individuals in government\u2019 and \u2018role modelling behaviour\u2019 \nillustrated the news media\u2019s tendency to create villains and heroes in the fight \nagainst HIV\/AIDS in South Africa. This tendency draws on simple Hollywood \nstyles of story-telling, which seek to create compelling stories that everyone can \nunderstand and relate to (Lule, 2001).  It emphasises conflict, which is seen by \nmedia outlets to sell papers (Iyengar & Kinder, 1987). This also has the effect of \nindividualising social issues, and diverting attention away from more complex \nunderstandings of HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa (Fassin, 2007). \n 22 \nNarratives such as these presume simplistic linear relationships between \nindividual actions and their effects on the broader population, completely ignoring \nthe wider complex of psychological, political, cultural and economic factors within \nwhich such relationships take place. \n \nGovernment bureaucracy \nThe third theme \u2018government bureaucracy\u2019 moved beyond this simple \u2018heroes \nand villains\u2019 analysis of HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa to explore some \nof the wider factors shaping HIV\/AIDS management. However, there were only 7 \npercent of articles in this sub-theme, and these articles tended to be descriptive \nstatements of bureaucratic problems \u2013 rather than more reflective articles \nexploring the causes of the problems or possible solutions. \n \nHaving said this however, this theme did represent a positive development in \nnewspaper reporting on HIV\/AIDS through its departure from a narrow focus on \nindividuals to consider the broader context in which they operate. One example is \na story in Business Day, which noted that bureaucratic confusion between the \nDepartment of Health and the Department of Education meant that teachers had \nnot received ARV treatment: \n \nHIV-positive teachers were not getting the antiretroviral drugs they \ndesperately needed because the departments of education and health \neach believed the treatment was the other\u2019s responsibility, a \nCommonwealth Secretariat workshop heard yesterday. (Business Day, \n2006-09-13) \n \nOverall, articles classified under the global-theme of \u2018leadership and government\u2019 \ntended to have a restricted focus on national leaders and their role in shaping \nHIV\/AIDS management in South Africa. While recognising that some of these \nstories deepened understandings of barriers and facilitators to HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement, the dominant approach in newspaper reports was to locate \n 23 \nHIV\/AIDS management as the domain of individual leaders. The basic \nunderstanding was of a struggle between individuals \u2013 heroes or villains \u2013 that \ncreated HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa. While moving away from simple \nbiomedical understandings of HIV\/AIDS to a political analysis, such \nrepresentations of HIV\/AIDS management still privileged a top-down analysis of \npolicy and implementation. As Fassin (2007) suggests, the huge focus on the \ndebate at a national level often obscured the reality of what was occurring at the \nDistrict Level, clinics and communities in terms of HIV\/AIDS management.  \n \nIn addition, focusing solely on national leaders foreclosed an analysis of broader \nfactors shaping HIV\/AIDS management (De Waal, 2006). This includes a lack of \nanalysis of how policy is translated into practice, and of the interaction between \nNational, Provincial and District health systems and government. As HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement is increasingly decentralised in South Africa, Provincial and District \nhealth systems play an increasingly important role in implementing and shaping \nHIV\/AIDS management. Newspapers\u2019 neglect of the Provincial and District health \nlevels means they fail to capture the full picture of the realities of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement in South Africa.  \n \nThe global-theme of \u2018leadership and government\u2019 was notable for its absence of \ndiscussion about community involvement in policy and practice. Policy was \nimplicitly depicted as a process which started at the top and worked its way \ndownwards in a direct and linear fashion. Communities were only mentioned in \nterms of the effects policy or government leader\u2019s actions had on them.  \n \n\u2018Effective\u2019 HIV\/AIDS programmes \nThe third global-theme, \u2018\u2019effective\u2019 HIV\/AIDS programmes\u2019 explored \nrepresentations of the criteria for HIV\/AIDS programmes that the newspapers \nregarded as successful. The associated sub-themes moved beyond a focus on \ngovernment policies to highlight actual activities and actions of government, civil \nsociety, communities and the private sector. Six sub-themes were identified: \n 24 \n\u2018partnerships\u2019, \u2018medical interventions\u2019, \u2018unsung heroes\u2019, \u2018NGO programmes\u2019, \u2018the \nTreatment Action Campaign (TAC)\u2019 and \u2018community mobilisation\u2019. This was the \nlargest global-theme (present in 49 percent of all stories) emphasising \nnewspapers\u2019 interest in reporting on programmes to tackle HIV\/AIDS.   \n \nPartnerships \nThe sub-theme of \u2018partnerships\u2019 was a relatively large sub-theme, with 12 \npercent of all stories. Newspapers widely viewed partnerships as an effective \nstrategy for HIV\/AIDS management. The majority of such partnerships were \nbetween the private sector and the government. An example of such a \npartnership was the alliance between the Department of Health and cleaning \ncompanies with the latter distributing condoms within the firms they were \ncleaning: \n \nSabcoha [South African Business Coalition on HIV\/AIDS] facilitated such a \nscheme earlier this year for condom distribution. Under the terms of the \ndeal between the health department and three companies \u2014 the Airports \nCompany of SA, the Durban Institute of Technology, and Suncoast Casino \nand Entertainment World \u2014 four contract cleaning companies distribute \nfree government condoms to these firms. (Business Day, 2006-10-02) \n \nA handful of newspaper articles reported on partnerships that went beyond those \nbetween government and the private sector. Often these were couched as vague \nstatements of intent rather than concrete examples, such as this report on the \nMEC of the Eastern Cape: \n \n\u201cAbrahams-Ntantiso [Sports, Arts and Culture MEC] stressed that \ngovernment alone could not win the fight against the spread of the disease \n[HIV\/AIDS] and that is why the council incorporated businesses, traditional \nleaders, the media and non-governmental organisations. The MEC urged \n 25 \neverybody to join hands in the fight against HIV\/AIDS.\u201d (Sowetan, 2006-\n11-24) \n \nThere was a dearth of reports of concrete examples and practices of \npartnerships involving a wider range of stakeholders (government, communities, \ntrade unions and businesses), Thus whilst newspapers often suggested that \nwider partnerships were the ideal of effective practice, there was little attention to  \nhow such partnerships might actually be achieved.  \n \nWe also explored the types of partners mentioned in discussions of multi-sectoral \npartnerships, since one article could mention a range of possible partners. \nGovernment was mentioned in 31 articles, and the private sector or business in \n23. Others were civil society (7), NGOs (4), traditional leaders (once), the media \n(3) and traditional healers (twice). Again the overwhelming focus on partnerships \nbetween government and businesses becomes apparent \u2013 neglecting the \nimportance of partnerships that include communities. We would not seek to deny \nthat government-private sector partners have a key role to play in HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement. However such partnerships are most likely to be effective in the \ncontext of wider efforts to engage communities (Campbell, 2003). Yet there were \nvirtually no articles at all focusing on this vital aspect of HIV\/AIDS management. \n \nMedical interventions \nHIV\/AIDS needs to be tackled through a comprehensive range of strategies, \nincluding stigma reduction, behavioural change, partnerships and provision of \nanti-retroviral therapy (UNAIDS, 2006). Yet \u2018medical interventions\u2019 constituted the \nlargest sub-theme in our data, with 17% of all stories focusing exclusively on this \ntopic. Reports repeatedly implied that medical interventions would solve the \nHIV\/AIDS crisis. As one headline in Business Day (2006-11-22) stated, \u201cSafe \nvaccine only way to conquer AIDS, say scientists.\u201d Similarly a long Mail and \nGuardian article (2007-04-19) on advances in HIV\/AIDS research focused only \non medical technologies (such as microbicides, anti-retroviral drugs and \n 26 \nvaccines) completely ignoring behaviour change as an area of research, for \nexample. \n \nOver our time period of interest newspapers expressed great excitement over a \nhandful of studies on the role of male circumcision in reducing HIV-incidence.  \nThe Mail and Guardian (2007-04-19) described male circumcision as \u201cthe hottest \ntopic in HIV prevention research in the past year or so.\u201d And Business Day \ncommented that: \u201cFor the first time there is really good news for Africa on HIV,\u201d \n(Business Day, 2006-12-27). All papers reported the male circumcision research \nin highly positive terms: \n \nTwo clinical trials, in Uganda and Kenya, have confirmed previous South \nAfrican research into the protective power of circumcision. The news has \nbeen hailed as one of the most significant breakthroughs in the fight \nagainst HIV for years with the potential to prevent millions of new \ninfections. (Mail and Guardian, 2006-12-07) \n \nMale circumcision became the \u2018medical intervention\u2019 of choice over this time \nperiod, in a more general context of reporting which sustained the representation \nof successful HIV\/AIDS interventions as medically driven, with the solution to the \n\u2018AIDS-crisis\u2019 lying in the wonders of medical advancement (Gywn, 2002). This \nemphasis served to depoliticise discussions of health, drawing attention away \nfrom the underlying social drivers and causes of ill health (Hodgetts & \nChamberlain, 2006), and failing to acknowledge the multi-level interventions that \nare would be necessary for successful HIV\/AIDS management. \n \nThe unsung heroes - individuals \nWe labelled the third sub-theme \u2018unsung heroes\u2019, a category that pulled together \narticles focusing on the role of individuals as catalysts in the fight against \nHIV\/AIDS. The Sunday Times reported on the \u2018Messiah of Matubatuba\u2019, in \n 27 \nKwaZulu-Natal, who through her tireless work provided childcare in a poor \ncommunity, previously a hotbed of child abuse and prostitution: \n \n\u201cWhen Angie McLaren shows up at her HIV\/AIDS care centre in \nMatubatuba, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, children clamour for her attention. \nTheir faces brighten as she greets them\u2026McLaren said that since \nopening the cr\u00e8che, child abuse had dramatically decreased. Jabu \nKhumalo, 38, a cook at Edwaleni, described McLaren as a \u2018messiah\u2019. \n(Sunday Times, 2006-06-04) \n \nThe majority of stories in this sub-theme focused on individuals coming from \noutside of particular communities. Only the occasional story reported on \nindividuals emerging from within a community to tackle HIV\/AIDS. For example, \nThe Sowetan identified Zimba, who had - since testing HIV-positive - started \nworking in his own community: \n \n For 16 years the Community Builder of the Year Awards scheme has \nbeen unearthing, honouring and supporting selfless community-\ndevelopment heroes. Zimba, 31, of Thembisa, is a shining example of \nSowetan\u2019s nation building ideals. Zimba\u2026is a fighter and one of the many \nunsung heroes of positive living. (Sowetan, 2006-05-25) \n \nStories of \u2018unsung heroes\u2019 who became saviours of communities tended to be \nstructured in similar ways. The community was represented as passive in the \nface of the HIV\/AIDS pandemic (Meintjies & Bray, 2005), until an individual \u2013 \nnormally someone from outside the community \u2013 arrived and \u2018acted on\u2019 the \ncommunity. This representation ignores the fact that the vast majority of AIDS-\naffected communities contain residents who are responding to the epidemic with \nimmense courage, generosity and heroism (Campbell, Nair, Maimane & Sibiya, \n2005). It also minimises the vital role that broad-based community involvement \nneeds to play in ensuring that successful programmes are sustainable over time.  \n 28 \n \nNGO programmes \nWhilst  only 5% of all stories focused on \u2018NGO programmes\u2019 such reports tended \nto be longer than average, and more prominently displayed with pictures. As \nsuch, while such reports were numerically small, their impact was relatively large. \nOne such article in the Mail and Guardian spoke very positively of the impact of \nan NGO driven intervention, in the face of the immense challenge of tackling \ngender-based violence: \n \nYet, our experience working with some of the poorest communities in \nSouth Africa suggests that change is indeed possible. The Image \n(Intervention with Micro-Finance for AIDS and Gender Equity) project \nprovides rural women with access to small-scale loans in order to \nestablish small businesses (microfinance). (Mail and Guardian, 2006-12-\n07) \n \nSimilarly, a Sunday Times report highlighted a Medecins Sans Frontieres project \nin the Eastern Cape, where there had previously been no ARV treatment. \n \nOf those testing positive, over 2000 are getting HIV\/AIDS drugs. Three \nyears ago, no one in the area had access to AIDS drugs\u2026It was started \nthree years ago by Medecins Sans Frontieres, the Nelson Mandela \nFoundation and the Eastern Cape Department of Health \u2013 and handed \nover to the national government last month. (Sunday Times, 2006-11-12) \n \nArticles on \u2018NGO programmes\u2019 emphasised their successes given the complex \nand difficult situations they worked in. The same Sunday Times article on the \nMedecins Sans Frontieres project commented on the face of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement prior to their involvement: \n \n 29 \nBefore the project started, AIDS sufferers lying in wheelbarrows lined up \noutside Lusikisiki\u2019s only state hospital\u2026 (Sunday Times, 2006-11-12) \n \nHere again, reports on NGO programmes tended to portray communities as \npassive in the face of HIV\/AIDS, dependent on the agency of outside actors for \nHIV\/AIDS management. This effectively obliterates discussion of the striking \nwork being done by people in marginalised communities who are responding in \nnumerous and effective ways to the epidemic (Campbell, Nair et al., 2005). \nFurthermore, as stated above, it effectively minimises the role communities need \nto play in NGO driven interventions if they are to be successful and sustainable \n(Pfeiffer, 2003; Campbell, 2003; Gruber & Caffrey, 2005).  \n \nThe sub-themes \u2018partnerships\u2019, \u2018medical interventions\u2019, un-sung heroes\u2019 and \n\u2018NGO programmes\u2019 all reflect specific understandings of communities within \nHIV\/AIDS programmes, and have two effects. First, they represent communities \nas lacking the power to change HIV\/AIDS in their area. Change, newspaper \nreports \u2018argued\u2019, only emerged when external actors, either individuals or NGOs, \nwent into a community and acted upon it. Second, the role of communities as \nactors in interventions was marginalized. The sub-themes of \u2018partnerships\u2019 and \n\u2018medical interventions\u2019 were particularly prominent in minimising the role of \ncommunities in programmes.  \n \nThe TAC \nIn contrast, the sub-themes of \u2018the TAC\u2019 and \u2018community mobilisation\u2019 stand out \nthrough their role in repositioning the role of communities in a more active role in \ntackling HIV\/AIDS.  \n \n\u2018The TAC\u2019 was particularly prominent in many articles, represented as actively \nchallenging and shaping HIV\/AIDS management and programmes. This partly \nreflects their role as civil society voice of choice by the news media (Finlay, \n2004), but the TAC is also one of the few community organisations that has \n 30 \nsuccessfully challenged the post-apartheid government in any area of policy \n(Friedman & Mottiar, 2004). Stories on \u2018the TAC\u2019 tended to be highly positive \u2013 \nbut there was variation in the quantity of reporting with the Mail and Guardian \n(8%) and the Sowetan (9%) more inclined to report on the TAC than the Sunday \nTimes (3%).  \n \nThe TAC was seen to be active in high profile activities across the world. At the \n2006 International AIDS Conference in Toronto they challenged the South \nAfrican government\u2019s display of vegetables but not ARVs: \n \nTAC tackles Manto\u2019s fruity display at HIV conference (Mail and Guardian, \n2006-08-24) \n \nIn addition the TAC was depicted as active in South African courts, challenging \ngovernment and court decisions. In one case a woman was denied custody of \nher children because she was living with HIV\/AIDS, the TAC was about to \nchallenge this.  \n \nJudge Smit\u2019s ruling is an indirect admission and public exposure of his \nignorance about the ways of acquiring this incurable, largely sexually \ntransmitted infection\u2026I am disgusted. But I am pleased that the Treatment \nAction Campaign will be lodging a complaint against this senseless \njudgement. (Sowetan, 2006-05-04) \n \nOther TAC actions reported on included a \u2018sit-in\u2019 at the Human Rights \nCommission\u2019s offices in Cape Town to demand the removal of Health Minister \nManto Tshabalala-Msimang (Mail and Guardian, 2006-09-07) and a high court \nchallenge to force government to provide ARVs to prisoners (Sowetan, 2006-09-\n08). Media reports on the TAC were positive, supporting their central role in \nHIV\/AIDS management in the country.  \n \n 31 \nHowever reports paid less attention to the everyday grassroots struggles around \nHIV\/AIDS management that make up the vast majority of the TAC\u2019s work \n(Friedman & Mottiar, 2004). Instead most reports focused on its more high level, \nnational and international activities. Such reporting privileged a representation of \nthe barriers and facilitators of HIV\/AIDS management as located at the national \nand international level \u2013 implicitly undermining understandings of more low profile \ndimensions of the TAC\u2019s work as a \u2018template\u2019 for successful community \norganising.   \n \nCommunity Mobilisation \nThree percent of all reports fell into this sub-theme. These tended to paint a \nrealistic picture of the challenges of community mobilisation in response to \nHIV\/AIDS in South Africa.  One story in the Sowetan, of a relatively successful \ncommunity organisation, detailed the way in which it struggled to start up: \n  \nCombining advice from traditional healers with the financial help of the \nlocal business community and a few volunteers, Tapologo slowly but \nsurely began to take shape. \u2018Initially we started off in Freedom Park \nsquatter camp. They were hard days. Initially we had only 12 women \nvolunteers\u2019 (Sowetan, 2006-05-22) \n \nA Mail and Guardian story on home-based caregivers also reflected on the \ndifficulties faced by community organisations: \n \nWorking with people dying of HIV\/AIDS is not a pleasant task, but \neveryday thousands of carers around South Africa travel from home to \nhome, offering help and compassion to people in their final hours. (Mail \nand Guardian, 2007-03-19) \n \n 32 \nThe relative dearth of such stories partly reflects the tendency for them to be \nregarded as \u2018worthy but relatively boring\u2019 in the world of news production, lacking \nthe drama and excitement that newspaper editors like (Lale, 2001; Parker, 2005).  \n \nSocial and community mobilisation stories are crucial for constructing the \npossibility of community involvement in HIV\/AIDS management. Greater \nreporting on community action in newspapers would open up the possibility of \ncommunity engagement becoming a more powerful representation in the public \nsphere, and a more prominent conceptual tool for shaping responses to the \nepidemic. The sub-themes of \u2018the TAC\u2019 and \u2018community mobilisation\u2019 were crucial \nin positioning communities as active participants in HIV\/AIDS management, \nrather than passive victims of the epidemic. Whilst being relatively limited in \nnumerical terms (representing a total of 10% of all stories) they highlight an \nimportant direction in newspaper reporting that needs to be sustained, if the \nmedia are to take a more nuanced and multifaceted approach to HIV\/AIDS \nreporting.  \n \nConclusion \nThe way HIV\/AIDS management is represented in the public sphere shapes how \npeople come to understand what might constitute effective HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement and the role that communities would play in it. Such \nrepresentations form the symbolic field in which responses to HIV\/AIDS are \nconceptualised and put into practice. As already emphasised, this is not to deny \nthe role of other factors, such as material and institutional factors (Campbell, \nFoulis et al., 2005) in shaping HIV\/AIDS management practices, but to sharply \nfocus on the symbolic realm in this particular paper.  \n \nWe have identified three trends in newspaper representations of barriers and \nfacilitators of effective HIV\/AIDS management. First, there is a focus on the role \nof \u2018important\u2019 individuals (politicians, doctors, unsung heroes and so on) in \nconstructing, shaping and implementing HIV\/AIDS policy and practice in South \n 33 \nAfrica. This focus forecloses discussion of broader political influences, such as \ninternational pressure and local economic demands, shaping HIV\/AIDS policy \n(De Waal, 2006).  \n \nSecond, there is a persistent focus on HIV\/AIDS management as a narrowly \nmedical issue. Treatment, care and prevention are all discussed from a \nperspective of medical knowledge. Discussions of barriers and facilitators to \neffective responses to AIDS focus on medical staff, financial resources for drugs \nand medical interventions such as male circumcision. This construction of \nHIV\/AIDS management as a narrowly medical phenomenon marginalises \nconsideration of the wider context in which HIV\/AIDS management is located, \nand a more holistic understanding that takes account of the importance of social \ninterventions and of non-medical support in tackling HIV\/AIDS. Indeed South \nAfrica\u2019s National Strategic Plan places HIV\/AIDS management in such a holistic \nframework (Department of Health, 2007), but this is not reflected in newspaper \nreports.  \n \nThirdly we have identified the media\u2019s prominent focus on top-down solutions to \nHIV\/AIDS management. Such solutions include partnerships, particularly \nbetween government and business, the restructuring of the health system, \nincreased spending and reforming government policy. Barriers and solutions to \nHIV\/AIDS management were overwhelmingly located at the national government \nlevel. Reports paid little attention to the way in which top-down policies were \ntranslated into practice, especially in the light of the increasingly decentralised \nHIV\/AIDS management system in South Africa where District Health systems are \nbecoming the locus for implementation.  \n \nCommunities received little real or sustained attention in reports. Articles either \nfocused on discussions and struggles at the national level, ignoring the \ncommunity level of analysis altogether, or else portrayed communities as passive \nin the face of the epidemic. Furthermore, media representations of HIV\/AIDS \n 34 \nmanagement were such that the full and proper participation of communities in \ninterventions and partnerships did not emerge as a compelling or viable option. \nHIV\/AIDS management was depicted as a challenge to be addressed in hospitals \nand clinics, with politicians and doctors being the key actors and drivers of \nchange. Yet, as we have repeatedly emphasised, without effective community \nparticipation, HIV\/AIDS policies and practices will not resonate with their intended \nbeneficiaries and are less likely to succeed in effectively challenging the complex \narray of political, economic and cultural factors that fuel HIV\/AIDS transmission \nand undermine effective access to formal health services (Campbell, 2003; \nCampbell, Nair et al., 2007; Barnett & Whiteside, 2006). \n \nOur analysis has highlighted the way in which media locates the power to \naddress HIV\/AIDS in a top-down way, focusing on senior and central leadership, \non health systems design, and on the role of biomedics, with little attention paid \nto the channels or processes through which power, knowledge and influence of \ngovernment leaders and \u2018experts\u2019 is enacted. There is an urgent need for greater \nfocus on the channels and processes through which policy becomes practice. \nThese would include the points of articulation, at the level of District Health \nsystems and communities. These form the interface between top-level decision \nmaking and the real and everyday lives of the masses of South African \nindividuals who carry the physical burden of HIV\/AIDS and the households and \ncommunities that support them day-to-day.  \n \nFor effective HIV\/AIDS management to become a reality in South Africa, \nespecially through the increased participation of communities in meaningful \nways, the way HIV\/AIDS management is talked about in the public sphere needs \nto change. There is an urgent need for reporting to reflect what is already \nhappening \u2013 namely that communities are responding and playing a huge role in \nmanaging HIV\/AIDS. There is also a pressing need to include representations of \nAIDS that open up the possibility for broader and more holistic strategies and \n 35 \napproaches than the narrow biomedical and technical approaches favoured by \nnewspapers in our analysis. \n \nIn this regard there are currently contradictory tendencies in the newspapers. \nFragments of a better informed and more holistic understanding of the problem \ndo indeed exist, especially in the reporting of \u2018the TAC\u2019 and \u2018community \nmobilisation\u2019. It is the extent to which wider understandings of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement become more frequent and prominent, or the extent to which they \nremain marginalized, that will dictate the possibilities of HIV\/AIDS management \nin South Africa becoming supportive of including communities as real actors.  \n \nThe extent to which the media should be expected to play an ethically \nresponsible role in tackling social problems is a controversial issue. Writers such \nas Seale (2002), writing in the UK, argue that the core aims of the media are to \nentertain and make money. He suggests that these aims are very different to the \naims of those concerned with health promotion, social responsibility and social \nimprovement. However, others such as Hodgetts \u2013 writing in New Zealand \u2013 \nmake a strong case for the development of what they call \u2018civic-minded \njournalism\u2019, where journalists are seen as having an ethical obligation to \ncontribute to efforts to reduce social inequalities and promote social justice. \nHodgetts and colleagues have had some success in promoting partnerships \nbetween critical social scientists and journalists through providing information \nand training on understanding and communicating about the social determinants \nof childhood poverty and health in New Zealand, for example (Hodgetts, \nChamberlain et al., 2008).  \n \nCall for a greater emphasis on media ethics, media monitoring and journalistic \ntraining are periodically made in South Africa. At various stages projects such as \nThe Mediaworkers Project, supported by the Department of Health, have  \nprovided workshops and regular meetings to develop journalists\u2019 understandings \nof the complex dynamics of HIV\/AIDS in the interests of better informed and \n 36 \nmore  socially responsible reporting (Parker, 2000). Writing in the Business Day, \nNathan Geffen and Gina Ziervogel call for greater collaboration between \njournalists and AIDS scientists, for example (Business Day, 2007-01-31). \nHowever Geffen and Ziervogel place their emphasis on the need for improved \n\u2018science journalism\u2019. Our analysis suggests an urgent need for more and better \n\u2018social science journalism\u2019. Furthermore, given the private sector base of most \nSouth African media houses, it is important to contextualise calls for more \nresponsible AIDS reporting within the frame of debates about business ethics, \nand not just media ethics.  \n \nIn short \u2013 if there is indeed agreement that the media have a role to play in \npromoting social justice and health \u2013 there is an urgent need for journalists and \nmedia houses to provide a more complex picture of the epidemic. Ideally, such a \npicture would develop a greater public awareness of exactly why communities \nneed to be more involved in HIV\/AIDS efforts, of the challenges of ensuring such \ninvolvement, and of the current strengths and limitations of those agencies best \nplaced to ensure this involvement takes place. It would also work to reflect the \ncurrent reality of the AIDS struggle in South Africa \u2013 recognising grassroots \ncommunity members as active and competent social actors who already \nshoulder the bulk of the country\u2019s AIDS burden, responding with resourcefulness \nand courage, sometimes under almost impossible circumstances.  \n 37 \nTable 2: Percentage of stories in each global-theme and sub-theme by newspaper (Totals do not add \nup to 100 because of rounding). \nGlobal Theme Sub-Theme \nMail and \nGuardian \nSunday \nTimes \nSowetan Business \nDay \nAll \nnewspapers  \nHealth \nSystems and \nCosts \nHuman \nResources \n5 9 3 1 \n3 \nRed-Tape 5 3 0 7 4 \nReform of \nthe health \nsystem \n2 0 0 4 \n6 \nCosts 6 0 0 9 6 \nTotal Percentage All Newspapers for Global Theme 17 \n \nGlobal \nTheme \nSub-Theme \nMail and \nGuardian \nSunday \nTimes \nSowetan Business \nDay \nAll \nnewspapers  \nGovernment \nand \nLeadership \nIndividuals in \ngovernment \n14 21 21 14 \n16 \nRole \nModelling \nBehaviour \n3 \n \n15 15 5 \n8 \nGovernment \nBureaucracy \n6 6 12 8 \n8 \nTotal Percentage All Newspapers for Global Theme 32 \n \nGlobal Theme Sub-Theme \nMail and \nGuardian \nSunday \nTimes \nSowetan Business \nDay \n All \nnewspapers \n\u2018Effective\u2019 \nHIV\/AIDS \nProgrammes \nPartnerships 18 9 15 8 12 \nMedical \nInterventions \n18 18 15 18 \n17 \nUnsung \nheroes \u2013 \nIndividuals  \n2 15 9 4 \n5 \nNGO \nProgrammes \n10 6 0 4 \n5 \nThe TAC 8 3 9 6 7 \n 38 \nCommunity \nMobilisation \n6 1 9 1 \n3 \nTotal Percentage All Newspapers for Global Theme 49 \n \n  \n  \nReferences \n \nAfrican Union (2007) Africa Health Strategy: 2007-2015, Strengthening of Health \nSystems for Equity and Development in Africa.
