Claim (b) is a contribution to \nthat debate. The overall position is not new and it has previously been defended by \nsupervaluationists about vagueness. However, the position is here motivated in a new, \nindependent way, and an explanation is offered why some uses of \u201ctrue\u201d do not seem to \nrequire disambiguation. \n\u201cThe word \u2018true,\u2019 like other words from our \neveryday language, is certainly not \nunambiguous. And it does not seem to me that \nthe philosophers who have discussed this \nconcept have helped to diminish its \nambiguity.\u201d (Tarski 1944, p. 342) \n \nAccording to deflationists, the truth predicate (and the concept of truth it expresses) \nfulfills a merely syntactic function, and that exhausts its meaning. Given this meaning, \nthey claim, there is no room for the view that \u201ctrue\u201d expresses a metaphysically \ninteresting concept worthy of further analysis. Deflationism thus denies the basic \npresupposition of the traditional debate on the nature of truth. If deflationism is correct \nthen the traditional debate is misconceived, or so it seems. \nThe deflationist explanation of the rationale for a truth predicate is, in my view, \nconvincing. However, it does not follow from these deflationist insights that the \ntraditional debate about the nature of truth is misconceived. For there is good reason to \nbelieve that the natural language truth-predicate is used to express more than one concept. \nOn some occasions of use it expresses a metaphysically neutral, deflationary notion of \ntruth, on other occasions it expresses a substantial and metaphysically interesting notion \nof truth.1 If this is correct, then the main insights of deflationism leave room for \ninteresting metaphysical debate about truth. For it may be that the traditional debate did \n                                                \n1 The occasions of use I have in mind here are those where \u201ctrue\u201d is applied to contents of thought or \nspeech. Sentence truth and utterance truth, in my view, are theretical concepts related to content truth. I \nshall comment briefly on this relationship in \u00a75 below. Most theorists agree that \u201ctrue\u201d, when applied to \nentities other than contents of thought and speech, sentences or utterances, (e.g. \u201ctrue wheel\u201d, \u201ctrue friend\u201d, \n\u201ctrue rate of inflation\u201d) expresses unrelated concepts. Though, as K\u00fcnne 2003 shows, there are some \nprominent figures in the history of philosophy who took \u201ctrue\u201d in \u201ctrue friend\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d in \u201ctrue claim\u201d to \nexpress the same concept. \n  2 \nnot concern the deflationary concept. This is the first thesis of the paper. The second \nthesis of the paper (a rejection of which does not require rejection of the first), is a \ncontribution to the metaphysical debate. I propose an analysis of the substantial concept \nof truth in terms of the deflationary concept and a notion of objectivity. \nThe proposals in this paper are not new. They amount essentially to a Tarskian \nresponse to the question \u201cWhat is the right conception of truth?\u201d. The question wrongly \npresupposes that there is only one correct conception of truth. In Tarski\u2019s own words: \nI do not have the slightest intention to contribute in any way to those endless, often \nviolent discussions on the subject: \u201cWhat is the right conception of truth?\u201d \u2026 \nIt seems to me obvious that the only rational approach to such problems would \nbe the following: We should reconcile ourselves with the fact that we are \nconfronted, not with one concept, but with several different concepts which are \ndenoted by one word; we should try to make these concepts as clear as possible (by \nmeans of definition, or of an axiomatic procedure, or in some other way); to avoid \nfurther confusion we should agree to use different terms for different concepts; and \nthen we may proceed to a quiet and systematic study of all concepts involved, \nwhich will reveal their main properties and mutual relations. (1944, p. 355) \nI take myself to be contributing to Tarski\u2019s project. My positive proposal as to the \nrelationship between the deflationary and the substantial concept of truth is very similar \nto that of Field (1994, see also McGee 2005) and McGee and McLaughlin (1995). \nHowever, my motivation for the ambiguity thesis will be different.2 The motivation I \noffer also allows a natural account of the close overlap between the two concepts \nexpressed by \u201ctrue\u201d. \nMy agenda is as follows. In \u00a71 I outline the deflationist conception of truth and the \npresuppositions shared by participants of the traditional debate about the nature of truth. \nIn \u00a72, I discuss various ways in which the question \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d can be taken, \nshowing that it cannot be taken for granted on any of the interpretations that there is only \none concept of truth. In \u00a73, I offer some considerations in favour of the thesis that \u201ctrue\u201d \ncan be used to express two different concepts, a deflationary and a substantial concept. In \n\u00a74, I articulate a particular proposal about the substantial one of the two truth concepts. \nThe proposal is that substantial truth is a special kind of deflationary truth. In \u00a75 I explain \nhow \u201ctrue\u201d as employed in logic and semantics should be interpreted. Finally, in \u00a7 6, I \naddress two objections. \n                                                \n2 While Field is showing that deflationists can make sense of \u201cnon-factualism\u201d about a range of discourses \n(vague, indeterminate, evaluative, conditional) by postulating an additional \u201cdeterminate\u201d or \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d notion of truth, I am positively arguing for the thesis that \u201ctrue\u201d as used in natural \nlanguage is ambiguous. Supervaluationists about vagueness are dialectically in a reverse situation to \nField\u2019s: they primarily have a substantial non-bivalent truth notion which they explicate as truth relative to \nall sharpenings. But considerations like that of Williamson and Adjelkovic 2000 lead them to give certain \nsignificance also to a disquotational truth notion, e.g. Garc\u00eda-Carpintero forthcoming. The interest of this \npaper relative to these views lies in the fact that it provides an independent motivation for a two-concept \nview of truth. \n  3 \n1. Deflationism and the traditional debate about truth \nUnlike redundancy theorists, deflationists about truth believe that the truth predicate \ncannot be eliminated without loss. It has an important function, a function that is \nillustrated by examples such as \u201cThe main claim of section 4 of this paper is true.\u201d, \n\u201cEverything Kripke says is true.\u201d or \u201cOne of Quine\u2019s doctrines is true.\u201d. We can\u2019t easily \neliminate occurrences of \u201ctrue\u201d from such uses. To eliminate it from the first example, we \nwould have to know how to articulate in sentential form the main claim of section 4 of \nthis paper. To eliminate it from the second, we would have to form a very long \nconjunction which might start, roughly, like this: \nIf Kripke says that names are rigid then names are rigid, and if Kripke says that \ngod exists, then god exists, and if Kripke says that porridge tastes great, then \nporridge tastes great \u2026 \nand so on for all the things Kripke might possibly say.3 A truth predicate, deflationists \nclaim, allows us to get around this problem.4 For, when prefixed with a singular term \nreferring to a proposition, the truth predicate generates a sentence that expresses, by \nvirtue of its meaning, a proposition equivalent to the one expressed by the original \nsentence. The truth predicate is a \u201cde-nominalizer\u201d\u2014it turns a noun referring to a \nproposition into a sentential phrase expressing an equivalent proposition.5 For example, \nthe proposition expressed by \u201cThe main claim of section 4 is true.\u201d is equivalent to the \nmain claim of section 4. Some deflationists express this view of the meaning of \u201ctrue\u201d by \nstating that we accept (or have at least an inclination to accept) each instance of the \nequivalence schema: \u201cThe proposition that p is true iff p.\u201d.6  \nDeflationists usually combine their analysis of the point and meaning of the truth-\npredicate with a second, anti-metaphysical claim. They claim that their analysis of the \nmeaning of \u201ctrue\u201d is all we might reasonably want from a theory of truth. The de-\nnominalizing function of the truth-predicate is its only function and there is no reason to \nassume that it should express a metaphysically significant property that is shared by all \nand only the true propositions, and which it makes sense to analyse.7 It would be equally \nabsurd to expect there to be an interesting property expressed by the word \u201cvery\u201d, or by \nthe passive voice\u2014even if neither of these devices is redundant.8  \n                                                \n3 Another way to eliminate \u201ctrue\u201d from the same sentence would be by attempting a claim involving \nsubstitutional quantification along the lines of  \u201cFor all p: if Kripke says that p, then p.\u201d. I cannot here \ndiscuss the merits of eliminating \u201ctrue\u201d in this way. \n4See e.g. Ramsey 1927, Quine 1970, Grover, Camp and Belnap 1975, Leeds 1978, Field 1986, Williams \n1986, Wright 1992, Brandom 1994, Horwich 1998, Soames 1999. \n5 It is not easy to specify the kind of equivalence needed here\u2014it is not identity (see Gupta 1993). Let us, \nfor the moment, assume that equivalence here is necessary material equivalence. See Horwich 1998, \npostscript for some discussion. \n6 Cf. Horwich 1998, e.g. p. 126. The qualification in brackets allows Horwich to make room for competent \nusers who do not accept paradoxical instances of the schema (these users will resist the inclination). \n7 Cf. Horwich 1998, pp. 1\u20132. \n8 Another example, which, unfortunately, is too closely related, is negation: suppose there is a linguistic \ndevice (negation) which, when prefixed to a sentence, produces a new sentence which expresses a truth \nwhen the original sentence did not and which expresses something not true if the original one did. What \nreason is there to believe that this expression picks out some interesting property worth analysing? \n  4 \nThe traditional debate about truth, however, assumes precisely that truth, the \nproperty expressed by \u201ctrue\u201d, is a metaphysically important property that it is indeed \nworth analysing. Thus for example, correspondence theorists claim that this property \nconsists in a relation between propositions or beliefs and mind-independent reality.9 \nCoherence theorists claim that this property is one that a proposition or belief has just if it \nis part of a coherent set of propositions\/beliefs.10 Pragmatists of one sort claim that to be \ntrue is to be useful.11 Pragmatists of a different sort claim that truth is the property an \nopinion has if ideal thinkers would agree upon it at the limit of enquiry.12  \nAccording to the participants of the traditional debate, the function of the truth \npredicate is to permit us to attribute a certain interesting property to contents of thought \nor speech, and it is precisely the nature of this property that is in dispute. Thus, \nparticipants of the traditional debate disagree with both deflationist claims, namely with \ntheir analysis of the meaning of \u201ctrue\u201d and their anti-metaphysical claim. \nIt may at first appear that the two issues that are in contention\u2014the deflationist \nanalysis of the meaning of \u201ctrue\u201d and the deflationist\u2019s view that truth is not worth \nanalysing\u2014are unconnected, i.e. that one could accept the former and reject the latter. \nIndeed, why not accept the deflationist\u2019s meaning analysis, but continue with the \ntraditional debate? Even if the truth-predicate is there to do the \u201csyntactic trick\u201d it may \nstill express a property and that property may be worth analysing. Even if de iure, the \ntruth-predicate is just a denominalizer, in may turn out de facto to express an interesting \nproperty.13 \nThere are some obstacles, however, to taking this line. Some of the a priori principles \nconcerning truth that figure in traditional debates are in tension with the deflationist\u2019s \nmeaning analysis. For example, one a priori principle from which a traditional debate \nmight start might be that true propositions represent the world correctly, and that truth is \nobjective. Not every participant in the traditional debate will agree with this principle, but \nmany will. If that principle is correct, then truth is a supremely interesting property, an \nanalysis of which will help us understand the relationship between our thought and the \nworld. The analysis of truth becomes crucial for our view of objective reality. (It is for \nthis reason that correspondence and coherence theorists are often seen as allied with \nrealism and idealism respectively.) Another, similar a priori principle might be the view \nthat truth is absolute: true once and for someone, then true always and for everyone. \nHowever, the acceptance of these substantial principles concerning truth will encourage, \nor even entail, the view that truth is a property for which not every content of thought or \nspeech is a suitable candidate. Thought and speech do not always aim at representation of \nobjective reality. Thus the contents of thought or speech that do not will not be \u201ctruth-\n                                                \n9 More precisely, truth, according to classical correspondence theorists is the relational property that a \nproposition\/belief has just if there is a fact to which it corresponds. Examples of this sort of view include \nWittgenstein 1922, Moore 1953 and Russell 1918\/19. \n10 Cf. Bradley, Joachim 1906, Bradley 1907, Hempel 1935 and Blanshard 1939. \n11 Cf. James 1907.  \n12 Cf. Peirce 1878. \n13 Alston 1996 and Sosa 1993 seem to hold that the deflationist\u2019s meaning thesis is neutral with respect to \nthe traditional metaphysical debate. Wright 1992, 1996 also holds a deflationist view of the concept of truth \nwhile arguing that the concept picks out a substantial property, though different properties in different areas \nof discourse. \n  5 \napt\u201d.14 They are neither true nor false, because they are not in the business of representing \nobjective reality.15 In other words, those who accept that true propositions represent \nobjective reality correctly will have to deny the truth-aptness of any propositions \n(thought\/speech contents) that are not in the business of representing objective reality. \nNow, not every participant in the traditional debate about truth will accept a priori \nprinciples about truth of this sort. Nevertheless, because some participants do accept such \nprinciples, it cannot, in the traditional debate, be taken for granted that all contents of \nthought and speech are evaluable in terms of truth.  \nThis sits ill with the the deflationist view of the purpose and function of the truth \npredicate. According to the deflationist, the truth-predicate answers the need for a de-\nnominalizer, i.e. the need for a predicate with the help of which we can express \npropositions equivalent to propositions we can merely refer to or describe (see above). \nThis need arises independently of the representational status of propositions (the contents \nof thought and speech). We need to be able to call Kripke\u2019s claims true whether these \nclaims concern objective matters or not. In the terminology of a recent debate: \ndeflationism about truth leads to minimalism about truth-aptness. But minimalism about \ntruth-aptness cannot be taken for granted in the traditional debate, because many \nsubstantial views of truth reject minimalism about truth-aptness.16  \nLet me summarise what I have just argued in easily manageable form. Deflationists \nmake the following claims: \n(D1) \u201cTrue\u201d is a de-nominalizer, nothing more. \n(D2) The property, truth, expressed by \u201ctrue\u201d is not a metaphysically significant \nproperty worthy of analysis. \nThe deflationist\u2019s meaning thesis (D1) leads to minimalism about truth-aptness: \n(D1*) All propositions (contents of thought and speech) are truth-apt. \nParticipants of the traditional debate, let\u2019s call them \u201csubstantialists\u201d, make the following \nclaims: \n(S1) \u201cTrue\u201d expresses the property truth. \n(S2) Truth is a metaphysically significant property worthy of analysis. \nSome participants in the traditional debate will employ a priori principles such as: \n(S3) True propositions represent objective reality correctly. \n(S4) Truth is absolute. \nClaims like (S3) and (S4) are incompatible with (D1*) and therefore with (D1). But the \ntraditional debate can hardly rule out claims like (S3) and (S4) from the start. In other \n                                                \n14 There is a difference between saying that some proposition is not truth-apt (or not a candidate for truth) \nand merely saying that it fails to be true. A pebble is not true, but this is no failure or defect, because \npebbles are not truth-apt. \n15 A classic example of such a view is Ayer 1937. Evaluative thought is an example of thought that is held \nby many not to be aimed at representing objective reality.  \n16 Cf. Smith 1994, Divers and Miller 1994 and Horwich 1994. \n  6 \nwords, if we are to take seriously claims like (S3) and (S4) in the traditional debate, as we \nmust, then we cannot accept (D1).17 \n2.The Concept of Truth \nSuppose that the deflationists are wrong and the substantialists are right. Suppose that \n(S1) and (S2) (as well as, perhaps, (S3) and (S4)) are correct. In this situation it might be \nconcluded that even though the deflationists are wrong about the truth predicate and the \ntruth concept, any community of thinkers and speakers ought to have a predicate of \nwhich the deflationist\u2019s theses are true. For, as the deflationists have shown, such a \npredicate is very useful. \nSuppose, now, that the deflationists are right and the substantialists are wrong, i.e. \nthat (D1) and (D2) are correct. Again, we might conclude that even though the \nsubstantialists are wrong about the truth predicate and the truth concept, at least they have \ndescribed a predicate and a concept that it would be quite useful to have, useful at least \nfor those who want to discuss metaphysics. \nThere seems to be no ground for denying that both substantialists and deflationists \ndescribe a coherent predicate and a coherent concept that it would be useful to have. \nPerhaps some may wish to deny the usefulness of the substantialist\u2019s concept on the \ngrounds that it involves obscure or incoherent metaphysical notions such as those of \nreality, of representation or of objectivity. But the legitimacy of such a complaint will \ndepend on the precise use metaphysicians make of those concepts. It would be prejudice \nto conclude that the substantialists\u2019 notions of truth, objectivity etc are obscure or \nconfused even before they have started. Prima facie, a predicate and concept conforming \nto (S1)\u2013(S4) is coherent and useful. There is no ground for a substantialist either, to deny \nthat a predicate that actually functions the way deflationists say the truth-predicate \nfunctions is useful and quite harmless (except perhaps in connection with the liar \nparadox).18 \nIf, then, there are no doubts about the legitimacy and usefulness of each concept of \ntruth, what are deflationists and substantialists disagreeing about? At least prima facie, \nthey are offering competing answers to the question \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d. There are at least \ntwo ways of reading the question. \nFirst, it might be a question about \u201cthe\u201d predicate \u201cis true\u201d as actually used by \nnormal speakers and about \u201cthe\u201d corresponding concept they thereby express.19 In that \n                                                \n17 Those who claim, (like Sosa 1993, Alston 1996,  Damnjanovic 2005, that a substantial theory of truth is \ncompatible with the deflationist\u2019s (D1) seem to be unaware of the restrictions (D1) places via (D1*) on any \nsubstantial account of truth. \n18 McGee 2005 doubts that the syntactic function of the truth predicate alone provides sufficient \njustification for a deflationary truth-predicate because a substantial truth-predicate can equally do this job. \n(He goes on to offer a different justification: the usefulness of  a deflationary truth-predicate in \nmathematical proofs.) I disagree with the basis for McGee\u2019s doubts. A substantial truth-predicate cannot \ndischarge the deflationary function because there are propositions which are not apt for substantial truth, \nbut which nevertheless generate the same need for a deflationary truth-predicate. Relatedly, I disagree with \nMcGee\u2019s claim that the difference between the two truth notions is \u201cnear-invisible\u201d (see next section). \n19 This may be a question about a particular natural language, like English, or a particular dialect or idiolect \nof English. The question might also be understood in a broader, more ambitious sense: what concept is \n  7 \ncase, the question is an empirical question that should be answered by recourse to \nempirical information concerning our thinking habits and language use. Secondly, it \nmight be a question about \u201cthe\u201d concept of truth that has figured in the traditional debate \nabout the nature of truth, throughout the history of philosophy. In that case the question is \na question of exegesis. I believe that on neither reading there are grounds for the \nuniqueness assumption encapsulated in the occurrences of the definite article that I have \nflagged up with scare-quotes. Let me explain.  \nIt is a substantial empirical assumption that there is only one everyday truth-\npredicate that expresses only one everyday concept of truth. Many expressions we use are \nambiguous, and such ambiguity is not always obvious. In the next section, I shall discuss \nevery day use and argue that many English speakers use \u201cis true\u201d to express at least two \ndistinct concepts. I will also be discussing other examples of natural language \nexpressions whose ambiguity is not obvious. \nThe uniqueness assumption is equally unfounded when it comes to philosophical \nexegesis. It is by no means clear that philosophers in the historical debates about truth \nhave always had in mind the same concept. Take for example Aristotle\u2019s famous claim \nthat to say of what is that it is and to say of what is not that it is not is true (Metaphysics \n\u03937, 1011b26\u20138). At first sight this seems to address the sort of notion the deflationist has \nin mind. For Aristotle\u2019s definition does not seem to leave any room for anything but \nminimalism about truth-aptness. Whenever something is said of something (i.e. \npredicated) we thereby have a candidate for truth. On the other hand, the Cambridge \ncorrespondence theorists20 quite clearly seem to be addressing a metaphysical question. \nWe cannot understand their remarks unless we take them to be addressing a question \nabout the kind of predicate of which (S1) and (S2) are true. The claim that Aristotle, and \nthe Cambridge correspondence theorists were expressing the same concept when using \n\u201ctrue\u201d therefore leads to an uncharitable interpretation of at least one of them. Thus, in \nTarski\u2019s words, \u201cwe should reconcile ourselves with the fact that we are confronted, not \nwith one concept, but with several different concepts\u201d (1944, 355). The uniqueness \nassumption in the question \u201cwhat is the correct characterization of the concept expressed \nby \u2018true\u2019?\u201d is simply unwarranted.21  \nThere are no doubt further ways in which the question \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d can be taken. \nOne that is often made explicit is the question of a criterion of truth, as opposed to an \naccount of what truth is. The point I am making is that even if two philosophers are \nagreed that they are addressing the question of what truth is (as opposed to the question \nof how to tell truth from untruth), they may still equivocate on \u201ctruth\u201d, because the word \n\u201ctrue\u201d is regularly used to express two different concepts.  \n                                                                                                                                            \nexpressed in English by \u201cis true\u201d and in other languages by translations of \u201cis true\u201d?. In each case, the \nquestion is one about actual language use. \n20 I borrow this term from K\u00fcnne 2003. The Cambridge correspondence theorists include Moore, \nWittgenstein and Russell. \n21 Of course, some historical theorist of truth, Q, may say explicitly that she takes herself to be in conflict \nwith some other philosopher R. In some cases, such announcements will have to count as indirect evidence \nthat Q and R have in mind the same concept. However, it may always turn out that the best interpretation is \none according to which Q was just wrong to believe that she was in conflict with R. \n  8 \nThere may be yet another way of taking the question \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d. Some \nphilosophers may start directly from some substantial a priori assumptions about truth \n(along the lines of (S3) and (S4), for example), not addressing any questions about \nexpressions or concepts actually used. In particular, they may be discussing the \nconsequences of such assumptions. It is clear that those pursuing this kind of a priori \nproject are not competing in any way with anyone who does not share the assumptions \nfrom which they start. Whether their project is \u201creally\u201d an investigation concerning truth \nis again a moot question.22  \nIn the next section, I shall argue that there are some reasons to believe that we \nordinarily employ both a concept that conforms to the deflationist\u2019s theory and a distinct \none that conforms to the substantialist\u2019s description. \n3. The ambiguity of \u201ctrue\u201d \nDoes ordinary usage conform to the deflationist\u2019s or the substantialist\u2019s theory? I believe \nthat there is some evidence for the hypothesis that ordinary usage conforms selectively to \neither theory, because many users use \u201ctrue\u201d ambiguously. On some occasions of use, \n\u201ctrue\u201d expresses a deflationary concept and on other occasions of use it expresses some \nsubstantial concept of truth.  \nSome preliminaries. Let me clarify what I have in mind when I say that \u201ctrue\u201d is \nused ambiguously. The claim is of the form \u201con some occasions of use expression e is \nused to express c1, and on other occasions of use e is used to express c2 (\u2260c1). There are \nseveral ways in which a claim of that form could be true. It could be that e is lexically \nambiguous in much the way \u201ccoach\u201d is in English. In that case, deep syntax contains two \ndistinct syntactic elements, E1 and E2, and each of them has a different semantic axiom. \nThus, disambiguation would take place at a pre-semantic stage of interpretation. A \nsecond way in which such a claim might be true involves disambiguation at the semantic \nstage. Thus, while there is only one syntactic element E at the level of deep syntax, the \nsemantic axiom concerning E makes its interpretation context-sensitive. Some theorists \nclaim that gradeable adjectives like \u201crich\u201d or \u201ctall\u201d have this feature. They supposedly \nexpress different properties in different contexts of use. A third way of taking the claim \nthat e expresses different concepts on different occasions locates disambiguation at the \npragmatic level. On this view, while e is syntactically unambiguous and semantically \ncontext-insensitive, it is nevertheless not always used to express the same concept. For \nspeakers often express concepts even though their words do not semantically encode \nthese concepts. Thus, while a given utterance of e may semantically express concept c1, \nthe speaker may intend to communicate, and succeed in communicating some distinct \nconcept c2.  \nOne might call the first phenomenon \u201csyntactic ambiguity\u201d, the second \u201csemantic \nambiguity\u201d and the third \u201cpragmatic ambiguity\u201d. The term \u201cambiguity\u201d is usually \nreserved for syntactic or lexical ambiguity. Semantic ambiguity is usually called \n\u201cindexicality\u201d, or \u201ccontext-sensitivity\u201d, and pragmatic ambiguity usually goes under the \n                                                \n22 Compare Jackson 1998, ch. 2, for a comparison of the significance of examining concepts used by us \nwith that of examining concepts in the abstract. \n  9 \nlabel \u201cconversational implicature\u201d. For terminological convenience, let\u2019s understand \n\u201cambiguous\u201d to include all three kinds of ambiguity. Strictly speaking, my evidence will \nprovide direct support only for the thesis that \u201ctrue\u201d, as used in ordinary discourse, is \nambiguous in this generic sense. However, I believe that with certain further \nmethodological assumptions, the evidence would count as evidence in favour of syntactic \nambiguity. To discuss these further assumptions would take us too far afield. For the \npurposes of this paper, however, the important thesis is only that speakers use \u201ctrue\u201d to \nexpress different concepts, namely sometimes a deflationary concept and sometimes a \nsubstantial concept. Whether or not this variation in what the word \u201ctrue\u201d is used to \nexpress should count as genuine syntactic ambiguity cannot be settled conclusively here. \nConsider the sort of evidence one might use to show that an expression is \nsyntactically ambiguous. The evidence would usually consist in the intuitions of \ncompetent users about correct usage. On one method, these intuitions are accessed \ndirectly by the researcher in virtue of being a competent user. This seems to be standard \nprocedure in natural language semantics. The method is unproblematic as long as \nintuitions are uncontroversial among competent users (as they usually are). On a second \nmethod, statistical data concerning language use are collected and used to support \nhypotheses about correct usage. This second method is not unproblematic because all we \ncan observe is actual use, we have no way observationally to recognize correct use. But \non some crude assumptions about the relationship between actual use and correct use \n(e.g. \u201cactual use is not regularly incorrect\u201d) such statistical data can nevertheless add \nsome support to the researcher\u2019s own linguistic intuitions.23  \nThus, in order to show that \u201ccoach\u201d is ambiguous, it is sufficient to observe that it \ncan be linguistically competent and rational for one and the same person in one context to \naccept \u201cCoaches are human.\u201d and in another context to accept what looks like the \nnegation of that sentence, namely \u201cCoaches are not human.\u201d, without changing his or her \nmind. (One might use the first sentence when the trainer is late for the match and when \nlater talking to a bus driver who is anthropomorphizing his bus excessively one might use \nthe second.) We can directly consult our intuitions about that, and support these with \nfurther statistical or experimental data of usage. The only good explanation of such usage \nwould be the syntactic ambiguity of \u201ccoach\u201d. Thus an inference to the best explanation \nwould support the view that \u201ccoach\u201d is syntacically ambiguous. Such an account can be \nbacked up further by an account of the way in which language users regularly \ndisambiguate with the help of contextual features. And it would need to be shown that \nsemantic and pragmatic ambiguity do not constitute better explanations.  \nWhat sort of data of language use are there to support the thesis that \u201cis true\u201d is \nambiguous (even when applied to contents of thought and speech, i.e. putting to one side \noccurrences such as \u201ctrue friend\u201d)? Many users would accept, or make, utterances like \nthe following two: \n(U1) That\u2019s true. (where someone has just uttered \u201cChaplin is funny.\u201d) \n(U2) Statements (judgements, beliefs, propositions etc) about what is funny cannot be \ntrue or false. \n                                                \n23 I am aware that the value of statistical data in this connection is limited (consider the research that has \nshown \u201caffirming the consequent\u201d to be a regularly used form of inference). \n  10 \nI believe that mere linguistic competence does not, in this case, tell us that anyone who \nutters both (U1) and (U2) must therefore either have changed their mind or be confused. \nEven users who disagree with (U2)\u2014e.g. because they think that questions of humour are \nobjective\u2014will still be able to see that (U2) does not contradict (U1). (U1) and (U2) do \nnot seem to be incompatible. We could easily construct further examples of this sort. \nConsider this exchange: \n(U3) John: Everything Benedict says is true. \n(U4) Mary: But one of the things he says is that skiing is more fun than swimming. \nAnd claims concerning matters of taste cannot be true or false. So not everything \nBenedict says is true or false. You were wrong. \nDo readers agree that Mary seems to be misinterpreting John deliberately? If not, \nconsider the following response: \n(U5) John: You are just being clever. You know exactly what I meant. I meant that \nwhatever Benedict says, he is always right. \nWhat John says is perfectly coherent. We understand it immediately and we do not need \nto do violence to our ordinary understanding of English in order to understand him. One \ngood explanation for this is that \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d (as applied to contents of thought and \nspeech) have at least two meanings: on the one hand they express concepts that can be \napplied across the board, i.e. to any content of thought or speech one likes. These \nconcepts may conform to the deflationist\u2019s theory of truth and falsehood. On the other \nhand, they express concepts the application of which is suitable only in a certain range of \ncontents of thought and speech. These concepts may conform to substantialist theories of \ntruth and falsehood. Again, the evidence here gives direct support only for the thesis that \n\u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d are ambiguous in the generic sense. Arguing that this is syntacic \nambiguity would take further argument. \nFor those readers who have doubts about my intuitions regarding (U1)\u2013(U5), I would \nlike briefly to mention some experimental data produced when I distributed \nquestionnaires among philosophy students at the beginning of three successive lecture-\ncourses on truth. The questionnaire consisted of 9 statements, each of them followed by \nthe options \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cno answer\u201d. I asked students to tick one option in each \ncase. Here are the second and sixth statements on the questionnaire: \n(Q2) Ali G is very funny. \nTrue \u0000 False \u0000  No answer \u0000 \n(Q6) Statements (judgements, beliefs, propositions) concerning what is funny can\u2019t be \ntrue or false. \nTrue \u0000 False \u0000  No answer \u0000 \nEach time more than half of the students chose either the true or the false option for (Q2) \nand also chose the true option for (Q6). In one year the proportion was as great as two \nthirds. Students gave these answers on the same page, and in quick temporal succession. I \nbelieve that the best explanation for this is that (at least in the idiolects of many of the \nstudents) \u201ctrue\u201d is ambiguous. When students called (Q2) \u201ctrue\u201d, they were expressing a \ndeflationary concept of truth. When students accepted (Q6), they were taking \u201ctrue\u201d in \n(Q6) to express a substantial concept of truth. Now, as mentioned before, statistical data \n  11 \nof usage are a problematic source of evidence regarding correct use, for we have no way \nof observing which uses are correct, or which students are rational. However, on the \nadmittedly crude assumption that actual use is not incorrect in the majority of cases, these \ndata would seem to offer some extra support to the ambiguity thesis. \nSubstantialist sympathizers (of the sort who agree with (Q6)) might try to console \nthemselves with the thought that students who ticked \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d regarding (Q2) did \nso only because I tempted them into this frequent and convenient, but ultimately incorrect \nshorthand. We often call things true or false that are not the sort of thing that can be true \nor false, so they might argue, and when we do so, we usually mean to express (non-\nsemantically) the deflationary concept.24  \nHowever, this is just to say that \u201ctrue\u201d, rather than being syntactically ambiguous is \nmerely pragmatically ambiguous. I said earlier that the data can also be accommodated \nby the hypothesis that \u201ctrue\u201d is pragmatically ambiguous for the students in question. \nWhether we have syntactic or pragmatic ambiguity is a difficult question. However, a \nproblem with this pragmatic reading is that there seems equally good reason to view the \ndeflationary concept as the semantic meaning, and the substantial concept as the one that \nis merely pragmatically expressed. In that case, when the students called (Q6) true, they \nwere talking about the proposition pragmatically conveyed by (Q6). The proposition \nsemantically expressed, namely that judgements about what is funny cannot be \ndeflationarily true or false, is obviously false, so they interpreted (Q6) as expressing \nanother proposition, one involving a substantial concept of truth. One problem of the \npragmatic reading is that there seems to be no reason to prefer one reading to the other. \nA very different reason for a pragmatic reading may be a desire to legislate language \nuse so as to preserve expressive power and avoid unnecessary unclarity through syntactic \nambiguity.25 However, in that case we would no longer be talking about correct usage, \nbut about how the rules of language ought to be improved.  \nMy conclusion is that at least as far as common usage is concerned (both measured \nin terms of linguistic intuitions and measured by statistical data), there is evidence to \nsuggest that \u201ctrue\u201d is used ambiguously between a deflationary and a substantialist \nreading. I do not have conclusive evidence that this ambiguity is syntactic ambiguity \n(there could not be such evidence). But whatever it is, this shows that the deflationist\u2019s \ninsights into the rationale for a truth predicate can be had without giving up on the \ntraditional debate about truth. \n                                                \n24 Some are tempted to say that we mean to say that we agree. However, that interpretation doesn\u2019t always \nwork. Consider \u201cI try to agree with what you say only if what you say is true.\u201d. Thus, those who argue that \nthe ambiguity in question is pragmatic better argue that the intended concept is that of deflationary truth. \n25 Compare the case of recent misuse of the phrase \u201cto beg the question\u201d. Presumably at the time of writing \nthe majority of English speakers understand, and use, \u201cbegging the question\u201d to mean the same as \u201craising \nthe question\u201d. The older, quite specialized meaning of \u201ccommitting a petitio principii\u201d, is not known to \nmany users at all. In this particular case, it would be desirable to return to a state where \u201cbegging the \nquestion\u201d can only be used to refer to petitio. For the disadvantage of a new ambiguity is not offset by an \nincrease in expressive power: the new use of \u201cbegging the question\u201d is merely a stylistic variant on \u201craising \nthe question\u201d. Similarly, if there was some other expression that unambiguously expressed either the \ndeflationary or the substantial concept of truth, then that would be a reason to use \u201cis true\u201d unambiguously \nfor the other notion. \n  12 \n4. Of dogs and ducks \nSuppose that \u201ctrue\u201d is indeed syntactically ambiguous. Then one problem remains. \nOrdinarily, if an expression is syntactically ambiguous, as in the case of \u201ccoach\u201d, then \ninterpretation usually requires a decision in favour of one of the two readings. Not so in \nthe case of \u201ctrue\u201d, it seems. There would seem to be many uses where no such decision is \nrequired. In this section I shall explain this fact and cite some analogous cases that are \nuncontroversially accepted to be cases of ambiguity. \nIf we accept the thesis that \u201ctrue\u201d can express two different concepts, a deflationary \nand a substantial concept of truth (whatever the kind of ambiguity involved), then we still \nought to explain how users disambiguate \u201ctrue\u201d on any occasion of use. As in other cases \nof ambiguity, users will choose, in each case, the interpretation that best fits the context. \nLet\u2019s write \u201ctrueD\u201d for \u201ctrue in the deflationary sense\u201d, and \u201ctrueS\u201d for \u201ctrue in the \nsubstantial sense\u201d. In the above examples (U2), (U4), (Q6), the context then requires \n\u201ctrueS\u201d because these utterances would be obviously false if \u201ctrue\u201d were interpreted as \nmeaning \u201ctrueD\u201d. All these cases exploit the fact that it makes sense for truthS, but not \nfor truthD, to say that some contents of thought and speech are not evaluable as true or \nfalse. \nTake another example: \n(U6) John: \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d [uttered after Mary has said: \u201cBut I paid the phone bill.\u201d] \nWhat is the correct interpretation of \u201ctrue\u201d in (U6)? There does not seem to be anything \nto choose between interpreting it as \u201ctrueD\u201d and interpreting it as \u201ctrueS\u201d. Moreover, it \ndoes not even seem necessary to choose in order to understand (U6). This does not \nnormally seem to happen with ambiguous expressions. In each normal use of \u201ccoach\u201d, \nthe user either means a bus or a trainer but not both.26 In ordinary cases of ambiguity, \ndisambiguation is required for interpretation. I think the explanation for cases like (U6) \nlies in the close relationship between truthD and truthS. Let us consider some analogous \ncases. \nMost people do not recognize immediately that the words \u201cdog\u201d and \u201cduck\u201d are \nambiguous in a certain way. Nevertheless they demonstrably are. Consider the following \npairs of utterances: \n(U7) No dog is allowed in the playground. \n(U8) Fifi is a dog, not a bitch. \n(U9) Ducks like eating old mouldy bread. \n(U10) It\u2019s a drake, not a duck.27 \nIt seems clear that in (U7), \u201cdog\u201d is meant to include all canines, whether male or female. \nHowever, in (U8), \u201cdog\u201d clearly does not include all canines, for if it did, (U8) would be \ncontradictory. Instead, \u201cdog\u201d here includes only male dogs. (U9) and (U10) are similar: \n                                                \n26 An utterance of the following sentence would be taken a sign of madness: \u201cCrucial to winning the \nchampionship were once again the coaches: the team arrived on some of them and were given instructions \nby others.\u201d  \n27 Thanks to Harold Noonan for the examples. As Ben Curtis has pointed out, certain professional \ndenominations, such as \u201cpoliceman\u201d or \u201cactor\u201d are ambiguous in a similar way. \n  13 \n\u201cduck\u201d in (U9) includes all ducks, no matter what sex, while \u201cduck\u201d in (U10) includes \nonly female ducks. The ambiguity of \u201cduck\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d may not immediately be \nrecognized by competent users, but it will be when users are confronted with suitable \nexamples such as (U7)\u2013(U10).28 \nThe two possible meanings of \u201cdog\u201d and \u201cduck\u201d, of course, are closely related. Let\u2019s \nsay \u201cdogU\u201d for \u201cdog in the sex-unspecific sense\u201d and \u201cdogM\u201d for \u201cdog in the sex-\nspecific sense\u201d, analogously with \u201cduckU\u201d and \u201cduckF\u201d. Then we can define \u201cdogM\u201d in \nterms of \u201cdogU\u201d, and \u201cduckF\u201d in terms of \u201cduckU\u201d: \n(D1) For all x, x is a dogM iff x is a dogU and x is male. \n(D2) For all x, x is a duckF iff x is a duckU and x is female. \nSince dogsM are dogsU of a certain kind, there can be (and are) many cases of dogsU \nthat are also dogsM. The same goes for ducksU. This fact explains why there are uses of \n\u201cdog\u201d and of \u201cduck\u201d where one does not feel the need to interpret one way rather than the \nother. These are cases where both concepts apply.  \nHere is an example. John owns males of many different species and rents them out \nfor breeding purposes. Thus, he owns several male dogs, several stallions, several \ntomcats, several hamsters etc. Suppose John owns only male animals, and this is known \nto his friends. One day, one of his animals is ill and he phones his friend, the vet and \nsays: \u201cPoor Louis is ill. Can you come and see him?\u201d. The vet, who can never remember \nthe names of John\u2019s animals, responds by asking: \u201cRemind me, is Louis a cat or a \nhamster? John answers with (U11): \n(U11) John: \u201cLouis is a dog.\u201d \nIt seems to me that neither the vet nor John needs to decide whether \u201cdog\u201d in (U11) \nmeans \u201cdogU\u201d or \u201cdogM\u201d. Either will do. Disambiguation is not mandatory. Let\u2019s call \nsuch cases \u201cneutral cases\u201d. Neutral cases will not occur with ordinary ambiguous words \nlike \u201ccoach\u201d or \u201cbank\u201d, because usually the alternative meanings are mutually exclusive. \nNothing is both a coach in the sense of bus and also a coach in the sense of trainer. \nNothing is both a bank in the sense of river-bank and also a bank in the sense of financial \ninstitution. \nMy hypothesis about \u201ctrueD\u201d and \u201ctrueS\u201d is that they are related in a way that is \nexactly analogous to the way I proposed for \u201cduck\u201d and \u201cdog\u201d in (D1) and (D2). This \nhypothesis explains why the ambiguity of \u201ctrue\u201d is not easily recognized, and it also \nexplains neutral cases, i.e. cases where we feel no need to disambiguate. The hypothesis \nis that truthS is a species of truthD. In other words, for a proposition to be trueS is for it \nto be trueD and to fulfil a further condition. For want of a better word, let\u2019s say this \ncondition is that the proposition be factual (I shall say something about what might be \n                                                \n28 Some may quibble about whether this is a semantic phenomenon or a pragmatic one. In other words, \nsome might say that the word \u201cdog\u201d unambiguously means all members of the canine species, and that all \nthat (U8) generates is an ad hoc interpretation of \u201cdog\u201d as \u201cmale dog\u201d. The same could then be argued \nabout the alleged ambiguity of \u201ctrue\u201d. I am not opposed to this reading, as long as it is acknowledged that \n\u201cdog\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d are used to express different concepts in the different cases, and that we do have both \nconcepts in our repertoire. \n  14 \nmeant by \u201cfactual\u201d below). My hypothesis, then, is that there is a property of factuality \nsuch that to be trueS is to be factual and trueD: \n(D3) For all x, x is trueS iff x is factual and x is trueD. \nIf this is correct, then the case of (U6) above is just a neutral case like (U11). When John \nsays that it is true that Mary has paid the phonebill, there is no need for him or his \naudience to decide whether he meant trueS or trueD. This is so because the proposition in \nquestion is factual anyway, so that it is clear that truthD and truthS coincide. Since cases \nsuch as this one are abundant, users do not easily notice that \u201ctrue\u201d is ambiguous and \nneed to be exposed to examples like (U1)-(U5), or (Q2)\/(Q6) before they realise this. \nThus, my hypothesis about the relationship between the two possible meanings of \u201ctrue\u201d \n(given by (D3)), would explain why, if \u201ctrue\u201d is ambiguous between \u201ctrueS\u201d and \u201ctrueD\u201d, \nthis ambiguity is not immediately recognisable and why there are  neutral cases. \nRecall the conclusion of \u00a73: there is some evidence that \u201ctrue\u201d is ambiguous between \na deflationary and a substantial reading. If \u201ctrue\u201d is ambiguous in this way, then one can \ncombine the insights of deflationism about the need for a truthD-predicate with the \ntraditional metaphysical quest for an analysis of truthS. Hypothesis (D3) is a contribution \nto the traditional debate. For it claims that the concept of truthS is analysable in terms of \nother concepts, namely the concept of truthD and the concept of factuality.  \nOne of the two analysantia, the concept of truthD, I believe, is sufficiently explained \nby my explanations in \u00a71 concerning the meaning of the truth-predicate according to \ndeflationists. This concept is not in itself metaphysically interesting. Thus, if the analysis \nis correct, the metaphysical beef will reside in the other analysans, the concept of \nfactuality. There is no space here to enter detailed discussions of this concept. \nNevertheless, in order to demonstrate that my proposal is theoretically fruitful, I shall \nbriefly indicate one promising way of developing the concept of factuality. \nIn my view, factuality is objectivity: \n(D4) For all x, x is trueS iff x is objective and x is trueD. \nA proposition (i.e. a content of thought or speech) p is objective just in case it is a priori \nthat when one thinker believes p and another thinker believes not-p, one of them must be \nmistaken.29 In other words, a proposition is objective just if disagreement about it cannot, \nas an a priori matter, be faultless. The objectivity status of a proposition is an a priori \nmatter available to competent thinkers who employ that proposition. Thus competent \nusers know in an a priori way that a proposition such as the proposition that Mary has \npaid the phone bill is objective. They also know that a proposition such as the proposition \nthat sardines are tasty is not objective. This is manifest in our habits of speaking and \nthinking. If Mary and John are in disagreement about whether Mary has paid the \nphonebill, then they will assume that only one of them can be right and they will, given \nsufficient interest in the matter, try to find out who is wrong. However, the same does not \nhappen when John and Mary are in disagreement over whether sardines are tasty: they \nwill not automatically assume that one of them is wrong, nor will they try to find out who \nis wrong. If (D3) is read as (D4) then it is indeed a substantial contribution to the \n                                                \n29 This definition is inspired by Crispin Wright\u2019s criterion of Cognitive Command, as employed in his \n1992. I have developed this notion in more detail in my 2002, 2003, 2005. \n  15 \ntraditional debate. One can easily imagine different proposals, such as the proposal that \nall and only those propositions are factual that involve exclusively natural properties, or \nproperties that are reducible to natural properties. \nThe two theses about the truth-predicate defended in this paper are largely \nindependent of any specific view of factuality. The thesis that \u201ctrue\u201d is ambiguous does \nnot involve the notion of factuality. The thesis that truthS should be analysed in terms of \ntruthD as proposed in (D3) is independent of the particular interpretation of \u201cfactual\u201d I \noffered in (D4).  \n5. Validity, Bivalence and Pluralism \nIn this section I shall explain which concept of truth we employ when we say that validity  \nis guaranteed truth-preservation, and when we give the semantics of a formal language. \nSuppose in addition to (D4) that something is falseS just if it is objective and not \ntrueD:  \n(D5) For all x: x is falseS iff x is objective and x is not trueD. \n(D4) and (D5) entail that any non-objective proposition will be neither trueS nor falseS. \nTruthS is therefore not bivalent, at least if there are any non-objective propositions. \nThis explains why truthD is better suited than truthS for employment in a \ncharacterization of validity. Many intuitively valid arguments involve premisses or \nconclusions which are not objective and hence not truthS-apt. A definition of validity in \nterms of preservation of truthS would rule out the genuine validity of such arguments.30 \nAll potential premisses and conclusions are, however, evaluable in terms of truthD (with \nthe possible exception of some arguments whose conclusions are decisions). Thus \nminimal truth is the concept of choice when it comes to defining validity in ordinary \nlanguage. \nThis explains why the current view is not vulnerable to a certain objection that has \nbeen raised against a different form of truth pluralism. On one reading of Crispin \nWright\u2019s Truth and Objectivity, it puts forward the following form of pluralism about \ntruth: in order to qualify as a truth-notion, a notion needs to conform to a number of \nminimal platitudes about truth. There are many such truth notions\u2014one for each area of \ndiscourse. While they all share the minimal features, they differ in other respects. Thus \nthe word \u201ctrue\u201d is ambiguous, for it expresses different truth notions in different areas of \ndiscourse.  \nIt can be objected to such a view (and Wright has distanced himself from this \ninterpretation of his view) that it would complicate our account of validity.31 For if \ndifferent areas of discourse involved different truth-predicates then there would be no \n                                                \n30 It might seem that one could just use a different notion of validity for these arguments. But often, \nintuitively valid arguments with non-factual premisses or conclusions will also be intuitively of the same \nform as certain valid arguments without non-factual premisses or conclusions. Compare Hurley 1984. \n31 Compare Sainsbury 1996 and Tappolet 1997, 2000, Beall 2000 and Pedersen 2006. Wright distances \nhimself from the ambiguity reading of his pluralism about truth for example on p. 924 of his 1996a (which \nis a response to Sainsbury 1996) and on p. 7 of his 1996b.  \n  16 \nunequivocal sense in which valid arguments with premisses and\/or conclusions from \ndifferent areas of discourse could be said to preserve truth.32 \nThe ambiguity thesis defended here faces no such problem. Every potential premiss \nor conclusion of an argument that we might want ordinarily to characterize as valid is \ntruthD-evaluable, so that validity can be defined generally in terms of preservation of \ntruthD.33 \nHowever, the issue of which concept of truth is involved in a characterization of \nvalidity raises some further questions. Logicians usually study formal languages, thus the \nconcept of validity they employ will be defined in terms of a notion of truth that is \ndefined stipulatively in the description of the formal language they are studying. How is \ntruthD related to the concept of truth employed there? Similarly for the concepts of truth \nemployed in formal semantic theories: how are they related to truthD? Clearly, the \nlogician\u2019s and the semanticist\u2019s predicate mean whatever the logician or the semanticist \nstipulate it to mean. Often, there will be a relation of similarity between the two: both \n\u201ctrueD\u201d and the stipulated truth-predicates will conform to something analogous to the \nequivalence schema or the disquotational schema. However, no closer relationship \nbetween \u201ctrueD\u201d, \u201ctrueS\u201d and the semantical predicate need be assumed.34 \n6. Two objections? \nIn this final section, I want to address two possible objections. \nThe first objection questions the metaphysical significance of my claims. A hard-\nboiled metaphysician might argue that all I have done is made some highly language-\nspecific suggestions concerning English, or even concerning some individuals\u2019 English \nidiolects. How could this possibly have any significance for the metaphysical question of \nwhat truth is? \nThis objection raises some methodological issues. I am the first to concede that my \nclaim that \u201ctrue\u201d is used ambiguously is a claim about a specific language. Even if my \nobservations were true for a significant proportion of English users, and even if they were \ntrue of translations of \u201ctrue\u201d into other natural languages as well, it is not obvious what \nthis has to do with questions about truth, as opposed to questions about \u201ctrue\u201d and its \ntranslations into other languages. Nevertheless, I believe that the relevance of these \nclaims to the debate about truth cannot be denied. My language-specific considerations \nwere relevant because they address the question what concepts people express when they \nuse a truth-predicate and I have argued that on two natural ways of understanding the \n                                                \n32 It may be possible to remove this problem by defining validity instead along the following lines: an \nargument P1, P2, \u2026 , therefore C is valid iff the truth-in-P1\u2019s-discourse of P1 and the truth-in-P2\u2019s-\ndiscourse of P2 and \u2026 would guarantee that C is true-in-C\u2019s-discourse. A similar suggestion is made by \nBeall 2000, but Tappolet answers that this response to the difficulty does seem to introduce a property of \ntruth-in-one\u2019s-discourse, which would be a property all truths share (contrary to pluralism\u2019s defining \nthesis). See Pedersen 2006 for a very useful and clarifying discussion of Tappolet\u2019s objection. \n33 In Pedersen\u2019s terminology, the thesis here defended is a \u201cweak linguistic pluralism\u201d and thus immune to \nTappolet\u2019s objection. \n34 See my 2001 for an argument why even a natural language semanticist need not assume more. \n  17 \nquestion \u201cwhat is truth?\u201d it is a question about the concept or concepts expressed by \n\u201ctrue\u201d (either in everyday language or in philosophy).  \nOf course, abstract considerations concerning concepts do not by themselves show  \nmuch about the world. It remains a substantial, and possibly empirical, question whether \nanything falls under any of the concepts discussed. Thus it is a substantial question \nwhether anything is trueD or trueS. I have not said anything about how we find out \nwhether a proposition is trueD. Thus I have not helped with the epistemological question \nof the criteria for truthD or truthS. But I have addressed the question of what truth is: I \nhave shown that one of the things we might mean when we ask \u201cwhat is truth?\u201d is truthD, \nand that another is truthS. I have also answered the question what truthD is, and the \nquestion of what truthS is. Thus, even though I have had to pay attention to language, \nwhen trying to understand the question, and even though this has taken up a large part of \nthis essay, I nevertheless provided answers to the question, and these answers are not \nmerely empirical claims about language use. Thus, the hard-boiled metaphysician\u2019s \ncomplaint is groundless.35 \nThe second objection concerns whether truthS distributes across disjunction. It seems \nthat we cannot allow truthS to distribute across disjunction, i.e. truthS does not support \nthe following rule: \n(Dis) trueS(p v q) \n trueS(p) v trueS(q) \nFor if we allowed (Dis) then we could prove that all propositions are objective. Consider \nthe following argument, where p is chosen arbitrarily: \n(i) p v not-p (logical truth) \n(ii) trueD(p v not-p) (meaning of \u201ctrueD\u201d) \n(iii) (i) is objective.  (criterion for objectivity introduced in \u00a74) \n(iv) trueS(p v not-p)  (from (ii), (iii) and (D4)) \n(v) trueS(p) v trueS(not-p)  (using (Dis)) \n(vi) p is objective (from (D4) and the criterion for objectivity) \nSince this argument works for arbitrary p, it would show that every proposition is \nobjective. \nI believe that the objector is right to say that \u201ctrueS\u201d does not support (Dis). The \nexplanation of objectivity I gave in \u00a74 requires us to accept (iii), i.e. that \u201cp or not-p\u201d is \nobjective. For surely, if someone were to deny (i), it would be a priori that they are \nwrong. Thus, a fortiori, (i) is objective. The only other plausible place to stop the \nargument seems to be the move from (iv) to (v), i.e. the step that requires (Dis).36 \nHowever, I believe it to be unproblematic to reject (Dis). Whether we should accept \n(Dis) ultimately depends on whether the objectivity of a compound requires the \nobjectivity of its constituents. To see this, apply the definition of \u201ctrueS\u201d (i.e. (D4)) to \n(Dis): \n                                                \n35 Compare again Jackson\u2019s defence of conceptual analysis, and its relevance to metaphysics, in his 1998, \nch. 2. \n36 Another way out would be to refuse to accept (i), i.e. to adopt an intuistionistic view. I shall not discuss \nthis possibility, because I have already endorsed bivalence with respect to truthD.  \n  18 \n(Dis\u2019) trueD(p v q) & O(p v q) \n [trueD(p) & O(p)] v [trueD(q) & O(q)] \nHow could such a rule be justified? Let\u2019s grant that truthD distributes, i.e. that \u201ctrueD(p) \nv trueD(q)\u201d follows from the first conjunct \u201ctrueD(p v q)\u201d. We would need to accept a \nfurther rule to the effect that if a disjunction is objective then so is each of its disjuncts. \nHowever, on the view of objectivity I was considering, a disjunctive proposition may be \nobjective without any of its disjuncts being objective. For example, it may be impossible \nto have a faultless disagreement concerning the proposition that Buster Keaton is funny \nor not funny. For to deny this will involve a logical mistake. But that doesn\u2019t yet show \nthat one cannot faultlessly disagree on whether Buster Keaton is funny. Thus, on this \nview of objectivity, there is good reason to reject (Dis). \nIt is worth observing also, that the objection can be rebutted independently of any \nparticular account of factuality. One just needs to make the points I have made about (iii) \nand (Dis) in the form of a dilemma. Consider a version of the above argument (i)\u2013(vi) in \nwhich \u201cobjective\u201d is replaced by \u201cfactual\u201d and \u201c(D4)\u201d is replaced by \u201c(D3)\u201d. Either (a) \nthe factuality of a disjunction requires the factuality of its disjuncts. Or (b) the factuality \nof a disjunction does not require the factuality of its disjuncts. In case (a), step (iii) of the \nderivation fails whenever \u201cp\u201d is non-factual, thus the objection (which relied on \u201cp\u201d \npossibly being non-factual) fails. In case (b), the inference from (iv) to (v) is illicit, \nbecause it relied on (Dis) and (Dis) cannot be justified, except on case (a). Thus either \nway the objection fails.37 \nMax K\u00f6lbel Philosophy Department \n University of Birmingham \n m.kolbel@bham.ac.uk \n \nReferences: \nAlston, William P. 2002: \u201cTruth: Concept and Property\u201d, in R.
