Indirect\nmethods such as stable isotopes [2] or genetic markers [3] have\nprovided useful insights, but for tracking animal movements, these\ntechniques still have important drawbacks and provide informa-\ntion on large geographical scales only [1,4]. Amongst the direct\ntracking methods, satellite telemetry has been the most important\nadvance in recent years. However, the current size and weight of\nsatellite tags is too large for equipping small birds [1], which\nrepresent the vast majority of migratory birds [5]. Due to these\nlimitations ringing (or banding), introduced in 1899 [6], has\nremained the most important source of our knowledge about large\nscale movements of small birds [7]. However, ringing has many\nlimitations itself [6], especially the usually very low and spatially\nhighly heterogeneous recovery rate [7]. This is particularly true for\nAfrica, where reports of recoveries are rare due to the low\npopulation density and because people are less aware of the\nsignificance of such recoveries [8,9].\nThe rapid advance in miniaturization of electronic devices has\nled to the development of a new powerful tool for studying\nmigratory movements of small birds: light-level geolocators\n[10,11]. These data loggers measure levels of sunlight and store\nthem in an internal memory together with a time stamp. Birds are\nequipped with geolocators in the breeding area and have to be\nrecaptured for data download after returning from their wintering\ngrounds. Once recovered, sunrise and sunset times can be\ndetermined from the recorded light level data for the elapsed\ntime period. Latitude and longitude can then be calculated based\non day length and local apparent noon and midnight, respectively\n[12]. The accuracy of longitude determination is equal throughout\nthe year, whereas determination of latitude is most precise at\nsolstices and impossible around equinoxes. Furthermore, position\nestimates can be affected by shading, clouds, latitude and the\nanimals movement and behaviour [12]. A comparison between\nsatellite transmitters and geolocators on albatrosses indicated a\ngeolocator location accuracy relative to satellite transmitter fixes of\n186 km (s.d.: 6114 km) [13]. This error may be somewhat larger\nfor land birds as they can enter dense vegetation or cavities and\nbecause topography can shorten apparent day length.\nWe used light-level geolocators to track European Hoopoes\n(Upupa epops epops) breeding in the Valais, an inner-Alpine valley in\nSwitzerland, to their wintering grounds and back. The aims of the\nstudy were to test the suitability of the technique for Hoopoes, to\nassess whether the recapture rate of Hoopoes is influenced by\ngeolocators and to gain first insights into migration routes and\nwintering sites of Hoopoes. European Hoopoes are supposed to\nwinter in the Sahel zone from the Atlantic coast to the Horn of\nAfrica, including the Great Rift Valley [14]. Of all Hoopoes ringed\nbetween 1914 and 2005 all over Europe, only four ringed birds\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9566\nhave been recovered in Africa, three at the coast of northern\nAfrica and only one individual in the presumed sub-Saharan\nwintering area at the southern fringe of the Sahara desert [15]. In\nour study population 4101 birds have been ringed between 1998\nand 2008 but none of these rings were recovered in Africa (own\nunpublished data).\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nAll animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal\npractice as defined by the Swiss Federal office for the environment\n(animal protection guideline 4.03). All animal work was approved\nby the Swiss Federal office for the environment and the nature\nprotection agency of Canton of Valais.\nStudy Site and Capture\nThe study area is situated in the plain of an inner-Alpine valley\nand spreads over a surface of about 62 km2. The plain is used\nintensively for agricultural purposes, mainly fruit tree plantations\nand vineyards. With very few exceptions, Hoopoes are breeding in\nartificial nest boxes, placed in small sheds used for agriculture. A\ntotal of 625 nest boxes was available in 2008. During the breeding\nseason 2008 we equipped 19 adult breeding Hoopoes (11 males\nand 8 females) with geolocators. Capture in 2008 and recapture in\n2009 were carried out within the framework of a project for\nstudying the population dynamics of Hoopoes, where all nest\nboxes were controlled every two weeks during the breeding season.\nNest boxes occupied by Hoopoes were controlled every three days\nand the birds were captured and ringed. As all nest boxes were\ncontrolled regularly, no additional effort was made to find birds\ncarrying geolocators. Recapture rates should therefore not be\nbiased towards birds carrying geolocators.\nGeolocators\nWe used Mk14S geolocators developed by British Antarctic\nSurvey (BAS) and attached them to Hoopoes using leg-loop\nharnesses [16] consisting of silicone. Devices weighed 1.8 g\nincluding harness. Birds with geolocators that were recaptured in\n2009 had a median weight of 70.5 g (min \u2013 max =63 g\u201382.5 g) at\nthe time they were equipped with geolocators. Thus the geolocator\nweight corresponds to a median percentage of 2.6% (min - max\n= 2.2%22.9%) of the birds body weight. Birds with geolocators\nthat were not recaptured in 2009 had a mean weight of 69 g (min\n\u2013 max =62.7 g\u201382 g) at the time they were equipped with\ngeolocators. The light sensor was mounted on a stalk of 2 cm in\nlength to prevent it from being covered by the feathers of the birds.\nGeolocators measured light-levels every 60 seconds and stored the\nmaximum value within a 10 min interval.\nLight-level data were linearly corrected for clock drift using\nprogram Bastrak (BAS) and visually checked for shading events.\nOnly continuously rising or falling light curves with a duration of\n20 to 30 minutes between maximum and minimum light-level\nwere used. Latitude was not calculated for 15 days before and after\nvernal and autumnal equinox. Based on a pre-deployment\ncalibration at a known location without shading we determined\nlight-level thresholds corresponding to a solar elevation angle of \u2013\n6u. These thresholds were then used to determine sunrise and\nsunset times using program TransEdit (BAS). Apparent day length\nat the breeding areas of the Hoopoes (an inner-Alpine valley) was\nshortened due to surrounding mountains up to 3000 m. a. s. l. and\ntherefore a calibration of the geolocators on the birds was not\npossible. Positions were calculated with software BirdTracker\n(BAS). Both, midnight and noon locations were used and\nBirdTracker\u2019s movement compensation option was applied as it\nis unclear whether Hoopoes are day- or night-migrants.\nData Analysis\nWintering areas were derived from latitude and longitude data.\nImportant stopover sites were identified by applying a circle with a\nradius of 200 km around each point outside the wintering areas. If\na circle encompassed more than five points (corresponding to a\ntime span of 48 hours), these points were assigned to stopover sites.\nKernel density estimation (program ArcMap 9.2, ESRI) was then\napplied separately for wintering areas, stopover sites on autumn\nmigration and stopover sites on spring migration on a UTM31N\nprojection. Search radius was set to 200 km and a grid size of\n2 km was used. We calculated kernel densities encompassing 50%,\n75% and 90% of the maximum density. The arrival and departure\ndates for the stopover sites and wintering areas were then\ndetermined from the positioning data. Where latitude data was\nnot available due to equinoxes or shading events, departure and\narrival dates were estimated from longitude data only. The course\nof the migration routes between stopover sites and wintering areas\nwas derived directly from the positioning data.\nBecause it was not always possible to determine arrival and\ndeparture times at wintering grounds due to equinoxes, we used\nlongitude data to estimate overall migration rates. We defined the\nminimum duration of migration as the time the bird spent between\nthe longitude of the breeding site and that of the wintering area.\nOverall migration distance was defined as the minimum distance\nbetween breeding, stopover and wintering sites. Overall migration\nrate was then calculated as migration distance\/minimum duration\nof migration.\nResults\nFive Hoopoes carrying geolocators (26.3%) were recaptured in\nthe study area in 2009 (3 females and 2 males). From the 111 birds\nringed in 2008, 25 individuals (22.5%) were recaptured in 2009.\nThere was no statistical difference in the recapture rate between\nringed birds and those carrying rings and geolocators (x21 =0.08,\nP= 0.77, n= 160). Because nearly all Hoopoes in our study area\nare breeding in artificial nest boxes, we assume that we were able\nto catch most of the birds present in the area. Therefore the\nrelatively low recapture rate is better explained by dispersal and\nmortality.\nOne of the recaptured birds had lost the geolocator en route.\nThe remaining birds originating from the same small breeding\npopulation showed three different autumn migration routes\n(Figure 1). While both females followed a western flyway via the\nStrait of Gibraltar, male C crossed the Mediterranean Sea along\nan axis situated between the Balearic islands and Corsica and\nSardinia, while male D chose an eastern flyway following the\nItalian peninsula. After a stay of approximately one week at the\nsouth-eastern coast of Italy this bird was located in the Ionian Sea.\nAs there are no islands around this position the most probable\nlocation lies at the Albanian-Greek coast of the Ionian Sea. The\nsouthern shift of the position data can be explained by the\ninfluence of the mountainous region on apparent day length. The\ntwo females wintered in the same region close to the border of\nMauritania and Western Mali where they remained stationary\nduring about half a year. Male C wintered about 1,000 km farther\neast, first in central Algeria, then mainly in eastern Mali.\nUnfortunately the geolocator of male D stopped collecting data\non 1 September 2008 and hence it was not possible to determine\nits wintering ground and spring migration route. Female A\nreturned back to the breeding ground by following a loop\nYear-Round Tracking of Hoopoes\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9566\nFigure 1.

Female B migrated around vernal equinox, when it is\nimpossible to calculate latitude. On its way back to Europe male C\nstopped over in the border region of Algeria and Tunisia for at\nleast two weeks. The further course of its spring migration could\nnot be determined precisely due to many shading events in the\nlight-level data.\nBased on the longitudinal data, which are not affected by\nequinoxes, we estimated overall spring and autumn migration\nrates for the two females (see methods). Female A spent 48 days on\nmigration in autumn and 32 days during spring. Mean daily speed\nduring spring migration was 122 km d21 and thus 1.5 times faster\nthan in autumn where the bird covered 81 km d21 on average.\nFemale B needed 33 days to reach the wintering area and 24 days\nto return to the breeding ground. Mean daily speed of this bird\nwas 118 km d21 in autumn. In spring it migrated 1.4 times faster,\ncovering 163 km d21 on average. These findings are in line with\nthe results from earlier studies [17,18] supporting the idea that\ntime constraints for Palaearctic migrants differ between autumn\nand spring migration [19].\nDiscussion\nThe results from this study demonstrate the enormous potential\nof light-level geolocators for studying migration of small birds.\nWith the application of only 19 geolocators (4 recovered), we\ngained by far more information about Hoopoe migration than\nwith the 4101 birds ringed in this population during the last 10\nyears and much more information about wintering areas than\nfrom all Hoopoes ever ringed in Europe. We found the first direct\nevidence of loop migration from an individual near passerine\ntrans-Saharan migrant and different migration routes and\nwintering sites within a single population. Based on ring recovery\ndata, Reichlin et al. [15] proposed a migratory divide for\nEuropean hoopoes running through central Europe in close\nproximity to our study site. This could be one possible explanation\nfor the low migratory connectivity between breeding and\nwintering areas we found in our study population. Birds breeding\nin eastern and western Europe may possibly show a higher\nmigratory connectivity.\nNew miniaturized geolocators allow for unraveling migratory\nroutes, stopover sites and wintering areas of small birds in space\nand time. The knowledge about the seasonal whereabouts of small\nmigratory birds opens new and fascinating perspectives in\necological research and conservation alike. For example, tracking\nindividuals during the complete year allows to study the influence\nof the encountered environmental conditions on individual\nreproductive decisions and success. Predictions of the effect of\nglobal climate change on populations of migratory birds will\nbecome much more accurate, because they can be based on\nweather data that are spatially and temporally explicit. Routes of\npathogens transmitted by migratory birds can be identified and\nfinally, such data will allow to evaluate whether current declines of\nmigrant populations in the northern hemisphere [20] are due to\ndeteriorations of environmental conditions at stopover sites and\nwintering areas, which in turn will guide more efficient\nconservation actions.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Franc\u00b8ois Biollaz, Yves Boetsch, Laura Dafond, Paul Mosimann-\nKampe, Thomas Reichlin, Baptiste Schmid and Matthias Tschumi for\ncapturing and tagging the Hoopoes.
