It therefore seems timely to briefly review the \nprogress that has been made in hydrological modelling and to examine whether an \nAlternative Blueprint should be considered as the basis for hydrological modelling at the \ncatchment scale. \n \nWhat has happened in that 30 years?  There are certainly now a variety of models that \nare essentially based on the  FH69 Blueprint but there has also been a continuing \nwidespread use of the type of lumped conceptual models for discharge prediction, \nrevitalised recently by the type of data-based transfer function models used, for \nexample, by Jakeman and Hornberger (1993) and Young and Beven (1994).  The \nmodern transfer function approach is at the opposite end of the modelling spectrum to \nthe FH69 Blueprint in that the aim is to let the data define an appropriate model \nstructure, rather than to use process theory to define a structure a priori as in the \nBlueprint.  For some purposes (such as adaptive real time forecasting) there would not \nappear to be any reason to use more complex modelling approaches. \n \nThere has also been the development of a number of simplified theoretical structures of \nwhich perhaps the most widely used is TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979; Beven et \nal., 1995; Beven, 1997) which, although it is computationally simple, has the capability of \nproducing distributed predictions of catchment storage or water table levels (see for \nexample Ambroise et al., 1996; Lamb et al., 1997; Seibert, 1997).  Relative to the FH69 \nBlueprint, TOPMODEL makes strong simplifying assumptions that will not be appropriate \nin many catchments (see for example Barling et al., 1994).  Some of these assumptions \ncan be relaxed (see critique in Beven, 1997, and Beven and Freer, 2000a)  but the user \nhas to take care that the assumptions are not invalidated in any application.  These \nmodels are not necessarily general in their applicability. \n \nIn their Blueprint paper, Freeze and Harlan aimed to provide a structure that was \ngenerally applicable.  They wrote down the equations for different surface and \nsubsurface flow processes and showed how they could be linked by means of common \nboundary conditions into a single modelling framework. Their analysis is still the basis of \nthe most advanced distributed rainfall-runoff modelling systems today (e.g. Abbott and \nRefsgaard, 1996). However, the descriptive equations that they used for each process \nalso required, in all cases, certain simplifying assumptions. Thus, for subsurface flow, it \nis assumed that both saturated and unsaturated flows can be described by Darcy's law,  \nwhile for surface flows it was assumed that the flow could be treated as a one-\ndimensional, cross-section averaged flow either downslope over the surface or along a \nreach of the channel network in a catchment (leading to the St. Venant equations). \n  \nIn 1969, Freeze and Harlan concluded that the level of computing power available at that \ntime would allow treatment of \n  \n\u2022 one- and two-dimensional transient soil-moisture flow in heterogeneous soils, with \nthree-dimensional numerical solutions imminent \n \n\u2022 three-dimensional, steady-state and two-dimensional transient groundwater flow in \nheterogeneous, anisotropic porous media \n \n\u2022 one-dimensional, unsteady, non-uniform, spatially-varied open-channel flow with \nlateral inflow and local channel infiltration. \n  \nThey suggested that further research was required on controls on evapotranspiration \nprocesses, the continuity between saturated and unsaturated flow, the continuity in flow \nbetween confined and unconfined aquifers, non-steady channel flow in irregular natural \nchannels and the role of vegetation in hydrological processes. \n  \nThis type of distributed model allows the prediction of local hydrological responses for \npoints within the catchment. The first applications of this type of model were made for \nhypothetical catchments and hillslopes by Freeze (1972).  The calculations required the \nlargest computers available at the time (Al Freeze was then working at the IBM Thomas \nJ. Watson Research Centre at Yorktown Heights), and even then only a limited flow \ndomain and coarse mesh of points could be solved. The first application to a field site of \nthis type of model was published by Stephenson and Freeze (1974) who attempted to \nmodel a single hillslope at the Sleepers River catchment in Idaho. The results were not \nparticularly successful but, as they pointed out, it was a complex hillslope underlain by \nfractured basalts, with complex flow pathways and limited knowledge of the inputs and \ninitial conditions for the simulation.  In addition, computing constraints limited the number \nof simulations they could actually try. Arising from these difficulties, they were also the \namongst the first to discuss the difficulties of validation of hydrological models. \n  \nThere has been a strong surge in the use of distributed modelling based on this \nBlueprint over the last decade. This has partly been because the increase in computer \npower, programming tools and digital databases has made the development and use of \nsuch models so much easier and partly because there is a natural tendency for a model \ndevelopment team to try to build in as much understanding from their perceptual model \nof the important processes as possible. Thus, there is an obvious attraction of distributed \nprocess modelling. There are also very good scientific reasons underlying the effort. One \nis the need for distributed predictions of flow pathways as a basis for other types of \nmodelling, such as the transport of sediments or contaminants.  Another is the need for \npredictions of the impacts of land use and other changes, when it is argued that this will \nonly be possible with physically-based models.   \n  \nExamples of distributed physically-based models include the SHE model Syst\u00e8me \nHydrologique Europ\u00e9en (e.g. Abbott et al., 1986) and the SHETRAN and MIKE SHE \nvariants (Bathurst et al., 1995; Parkin et al., 1996; Refsgaard and Storm, 1995; \nRefsgaard, 1997), the IHDM model (Institute of Hydrology Distributed Model, e.g. Calver \nand Wood, 1995), in Australia there is the CSIRO TOPOG model (e.g. Vertessy et al. \n1993), in Germany HILLFLOW (Bronstert and Plate, 1997) and there are a number of \nothers. They differ primarily in the way they discretise a catchment and solve the \nprocess equations (sometimes with simplifications), but all are essentially based on the \noriginal FH69 Blueprint as a description of the flow processes.  Advances in computer \npower have also now greatly relaxed the limitations on the solutions possible.  Fully \nthree-dimensional subsurface flow solutions to coupled two-dimensional surface \nsolutions are now possible on desktop workstations and parallel workstations will allow \nfiner element meshes and larger catchments to be simulated.  Increased graphic \ncapabilities have also made the preparation of spatial datafiles and the presentation of \nmodel results much easier.   It is worth asking, however, whether there might be \nalternative ways of using the available computer power in the next millennium since we \nmust recognise a fundamental difference between solving the flow equations in \nhydrology and other fluid dynamics disciplines such as meteorology, oceanography and \nlimnology.  This difference is that in surface and subsurface hydrology the small scale \nflows are largely dominated by the local geometry and local boundary resistances of the \nindividual flow pathways rather than the dynamics of the fluid itself.  This means that \ncomputational improvements are not only a matter of resolving finer characteristics of \nthe flow but also of characterising of the medium or channels in which the flow is taking \nplace (Beven, 2000).  This is not a computational problem (but interacts with the \ncomputational problem in terms of the effective parameter values required for the \nsolution). \n \nThe hydrological literature is not short of reviews and discussions of the advantages, \nlimitations and potential of physically-based distributed models.  Some interesting \nexamples are the papers of Beven (1989); Grayson et al.(1992); Smith et al. (1994); De \nMarsily (1994); Woolhiser (1996); and the exchange between Beven (1996) and \nRefsgaard et al. (1996).   It is not necessary to rehearse all the arguments here but I will \nconcentrate on the question of whether it might be possible to improve on the modelling \nstrategy embodied in the FH69 Blueprint.  The ideas presented are deliberately radical \nwith the aim of stimulating discussion.  I do not expect, however, that this Alternative \nBlueprint will define the modelling agenda for the next 30 years, since ultimately \nadvances in this field will be far more dependent on the development of new \nmeasurement techniques or more creative use of existing measurement techniques than \non new theory or computational techniques.  What is offered here is more of a modelling \nmethodology that can be applied to a variety of potential existing and future modelling \nstructures. \n \nWhy does the FH69 Blueprint need to be reconsidered? \n \nThere is one very important limitation of the FH69 Blueprint that will ultimately result in it \nbeing abandoned.  Particularly in its description of unsaturated subsurface flow, it is \nbased on Darcian theory that may be applicable at small scales but is certainly not \napplicable at large scales due to the effects of the nonlinearity of the Darcy flow \nequation, the heterogeneity of soil properties and preferential flow of different types.  \nModels that derive from the FH69 Blueprint have, with some few exceptions, not \nattempted to change the simplified process description that underlies it.  There is thus a \nvery large investment in structures that are based on a rigorous but inappropriate \ndescription of the flow processes, but that assume that the theory can be used if \n\u201ceffective\u201d parameter values can be found.  That the concept of \u201ceffective\u201d parameter \nvalues is unsound was demonstrated over a decade ago by Binley et al. (1989).  This \nalone should induce a re-evaluation of models based on the Darcian Blueprint and \nperhaps would have done so already if an obvious alternative theory existed to put in its \nplace.  \n \nWhat are the prospects for an improved theory?  In one sense a complete process \nunderstanding already exists in the form of the Navier-Stokes equations that are the \nbasis of a detailed description of all fluid flows.  The difficulty in modelling hydrologically-\nrelevant flows is not that the underlying physical basis is not well understood at small \nscales, it is that the boundary conditions for the flows are so variable that integration to a \nlarger hydrological scale is both a theoretical and practical constraint to the application of \nthe Navier-Stokes description (even if computational constraints are ignored).  A recent \nattempt at this, invoking mass, energy and momentum conservation balances and \nentropy constraints at larger scales has been provided by Reggiani et al. (1998, 1999, \n2000, see below).  \n \nThus, the Darcian Blueprint can already be considered as an approximation to a fuller \nphysical description that is an attempt at an integration over a certain population of pore \nspaces. The problem of heterogeneity of pore space boundary conditions is not, \nhowever, eliminated at the Darcian scale; a problem that has long been recognised as \nheterogeneity in the soil hydraulic properties.  There have certainly been some attempts \nto take account of heterogeneity of porous medium properties, including fractal \nheterogeneity (e.g. Neuman, 1995; Pachepsky and Timlin, 1998)and to include \npreferential flows into hillslope and catchment scale models (e.g. Bronstert and Plate, \n1997; Faeh et al., 1997).  There would appear to be a very fundamental limitation to \nsuch attempts, however, due to critical measurement limitations and the essential scale \ndependent nature of any such representations (as recognised by Beven, 1995, and \nexplicitly in the theory of Reggiani et al., 1999).  \n \nCatchment hydrology suffers from a measurement problem in that, with the exception of \ndischarge measurements, most other measurement techniques provide information at \nsmall scales (and are also often invasive with the potential to change the response of the \nsystem by the very process of observation).   This is a basic limitation on the possibility \nfor characterising a catchment system, and would remain so even if the FH69 Darcian \nBlueprint were correct or if some  revised theory of flow in heterogeneous soils with \npreferential flows (which would undoubtedly have more parameters to be determined) \ncould be constructed. \n \nThus, although there are important limitations in the basic theory of the current Blueprint, \nthe far greater problem is in the proper characterisation of the uniqueness of individual \ncatchments.  There is evidence for this in the fact that 30 years after FH69 there are still \nvery few applications of physically-based models based on measured or estimated \nparameters alone and very few validations of distributed predictions against distributed \nmeasurements.  In the whole of the recent book on Distributed Modelling edited by \nAbbott and Refsgaard (1996), for example, there appears to be only one comparison \nbetween predictions of a distributed model and internal state measurements in a model \nof the Karup catchment in Denmark for which three point water table measurements are \ncompared with predictions on a 500 m grid (p135).  The comparison shows that there is \nsignificant uncertainty in the predictions.  Parkin et al. (1996) in another application of \nthe SHE model to the small Rimbaud catchment in the south of France, demonstrate \nconsiderable uncertainty in discharge predictions based only on prior estimates of \neffective parameter values, conditioned on a few point field measurements.  Loague and \nKiryakidis (1997) report on the latest, not very successful, attempts to model the R-5 \ncatchment at Coshocton using only measured, spatially variable, infiltration parameters, \nconcluding that, despite all the work that has been done at the site, their process \nrepresentation is not adequate.     \n \nThere is an argument, proffered, for example, by De Marsily (1994) and Smith et al. \n(1994) that a proper understanding of the nature and causes of the heterogeneity of soil \nand aquifer parameter values should lead to improvements in physically-based \nmodelling.  In this view, the limitations inherent in current applications does not invalidate \nthe basis of the (FH69) equations of such models (The Type 1 models of Smith et al., \n1994).  While this might be considered to be self-evidently true, the potential for \nimprovement in this way must necessarily be limited.  Understanding of the nature and \ncauses of heterogeneity of characteristics necessarily introduces complexity.  \nComplexity almost inevitably introduces more parameter values in any description of that \ncomplexity.  Requiring more parameter values implies more measurements that must be \nmade to define those parameters, even if only to define the nature of the stochastic \ndistribution being used to describe the heterogeneity.  And if the distributions are likely \nthemselves to be spatially heterogeneous with horizon and position in the catchment it is \ndifficult to see that such a characterisation will ever be practically feasible with the point \nmeasurement techniques currently available, or at least not without considerable \nuncertainty.   This would not, therefore, appear to be a satisfactory solution to the \nproblems of the current Blueprint. \n \nThe only chance of success would be if detailed studies in some locations could be used \nto define the characteristics of other locations on the basis of simpler measurements in \nsome way.  One example strategy is the use of soil texture variables in the regression \nrelationships for soil hydraulic characteristics known as pedotransfer functions.  These \ncurrently ignore heterogeneity, often even ignore the standard errors of estimation, and \nany more parameter rich approaches must introduce considerable uncertainty in \napplications to specific catchments with their own unique characteristics.  Experience, \nsuch as in the R-5 catchment mentioned above, suggests that the prognosis for the \nsurvival of the current Blueprint by this cure is not good. \n \n \nTowards an Alternative Blueprint at hydrological relevant scales \n \nThe FH69 Blueprint is an approach based on the aggregation of (already approximate) \nsmall scale theory to larger scale applications.  It serves, in essence, as a scaling theory, \nusing the partial differential equations as a way of extrapolating limited small scale \nknowledge to the scale of hillslopes and catchments.  The Alternative Blueprint to be \nproposed here takes a very different approach based on disaggregation of the \nhydrological functioning of different parts of the landscape, which is, after all, what we \nare interested in (after the precursory requirement of using models to formulate our \nhydrological knowledge).   \n \nThere are two major steps in this Alternative Blueprint.  The first is to define a \u201cmodel \nspace\u201d that is sufficiently broad so as to encompass the range of functional responses \nwithin the catchment of interest (noting that the current generation of physically-based \nmodels might be one contender as a description of the functional responses).  The \nsecond is to map the \u201clandscape space\u201d of the catchment into this model space on the \nbasis of all the information that is available about the catchment.  Because of \nuncertainties in both model structures, boundary conditions and observations, this will \nnecessarily be an uncertain or fuzzy mapping, resulting in predictive uncertainty (Beven, \n2000).  There is also the possibility of a third stage in which the model space is reduced \nto a number of functional classes to facilitate the computation of predictions (see for \nexample Franks and Beven, 1998, Beven and Franks, 1999). \n \nWhat then is this \u201cmodel space\u201d?  There is no unambiguous definition of assumptions \nand equations (as in the FH69 Blueprint) since there is no unambiguous description of \ncatchment flow processes given normal levels of knowledge of a catchment, even at \nresearch sites.  The model space may, a priori, include a number of different contending \nmodel structures and within each structure a variety of parameter sets that are expected \nto give reasonable predictions of the functional response of the catchment or points \nwithin the catchment.  The model space explicitly recognises that it may not be possible \nto specify a single model structure or parameter set as the \u201ccorrect\u201d description of the \ncatchment (see following section).  It may be visualised as a high dimensional space in \nwhich potential model structures and associated parameter values form the axes (figure \n1).   The only critical constraint at this point is that the models considered must make \npredictions of the variables required in an application and of the variables for which \nobservations are available for model evaluation (see below). \n \nThe most important component of this Alternative Blueprint is then the mapping of the \n(unique) catchment under study (the landscape space) into this model space.  This is \ntreated as a conditioning process by evaluating different models (structures and \nparameter sets) in terms of how well they reproduce the observations.  Some models will \nnot reproduce the observations and can be rejected as \u201cnon-behavioural\u201d.  Others will \nreproduce the observations to some agreed level of acceptability and will be retained as \n\u201cbehavioural\u201d.   However, there may be no clear boundary between what is considered \nacceptable and what is not and many models may fall into a middle ground of possibly \nacceptable.  This mapping must therefore necessarily be a fuzzy mapping. This should \nnot be considered a disadvantage of the proposed methodology, but rather an explicit \nrecognition within the Alternative Blueprint of the real nature of the modelling process.  It \nis the idea that there can be a true model of the reality that is a unique catchment with \nour current state of knowledge and measurement techniques that, while a commendable \naim, is in practice artificial. \n \nThe problems of evaluating acceptability and deciding what is an appropriate level of \nacceptability will be discussed below.  However, it is worth noting here that this Blueprint \nreplaces a need for the calibration of parameter values in favour of the conditioning \nprocess that is the fuzzy mapping into the model space. \n \nDefining the model space: the conservation of mass \n \nConsider the local mass balance equation which, in the continuum form, may be stated \nas: \n \nepq\ndt\ndS\n\u2212+\u2207=      (1) \n \nwhere S is a local mass storage, \u2207q is the divergence in local mass flux, p is a local \nsource term (such as precipitation) and e is a local loss term (such as \nevapotranspiration).  It is worth noting in passing that this self-evident law is not \ngenerally verifiable in any hydrological system of practical interest, due to unknown \nmeasurement errors in all the variables and lack of knowledge of the boundary \nconditions, particularly for subsurface flow components.  It is, however, an appropriate \nconstraint on any hydrological model.  Other conservation equations (for energy or \nmomentum, Reggiani et al., 1998, 1999) are equally general but cannot generally be \nused as model constraints since energy losses are extremely difficult to formulate in \nother than very special conditions (see below). \n \nThe mass balance equation is not, however, particularly useful in this local form.  Digital \ncomputers and practical hydrological models necessarily work in discrete space and \ntime increments, whether the spatial discretisation be at the scale of catchments, sub-\ncatchments, hydrological response units or at the scale of finite elements or finite \nvolumes representing discretised soil profiles or hillslope.  Process descriptions based \non continuum mechanics are not necessarily advantageous in this discrete space.  \nFollowing Reggiani et al. (1998, 1999) a control volume form of (1) will be generally \nmore useful as: \n \n\u222b \u222b \u222b \u222b\u222b\u222b\u222b \u222b\u222b\u222b \u00b1= dVdtedxdtqdVdtdS     (2) \n \nwhere q is now a volume flux normal to the boundary (including precipitation inputs), e is \nnow a source or sink term within the volume and \u222b dx  denotes an integration over the \nexternal surfaces of the control volume.  This equation is the basis for all hydrological \nmodels and may be applied regardless of process, scale and discretisation.  It is not, in \nitself, a sufficient basis for defining a hydrological model.  Additional relationships are \nrequired for the dependence of all the variables on the right hand side with both local \nstorage S and, if necessary, the storages in adjacent connected volumes (this might not \nbe necessary if the control volume is at the catchment scale and the catchment is \nconsidered to have an impermeable base).   \n \nThese dependencies can be separated into two (related) parts: intra-volume and inter-\nvolume dependencies.  Intra-volume dependencies will reflect the effects of the \ndistribution of water within the element on the variables, q and e.  Inter-volume \ndependencies will reflect the effects of the distribution of water within adjacent elements \non the boundary fluxes, q.  For the case of subsurface flow, the FH69 Blueprint used an \naverage potential (or moisture content) and the soil water characteristic curves to define \nthe intra-volume dependencies, and a first order potential gradient relationship (Darcy\u2019s \nlaw) to define the inter-volume dependencies.   \n \nThis choices are not necessarily self-evident and, as pointed out above, may be a \nmisapplication of a small scale description at larger scales.  This is understandable, \ngiven the lack of larger scale measurement techniques that might allow a more \nappropriate description, but we should consider alternative choices in an attempt to \nproduce a more realistic (if probably not verifiable) description. \n \nFor control volumes at larger scales, it must be recognised that within the volume there \nis no single potential status for the water stored within it.  There is, rather, a distribution \nof potentials within the volume associated with local storages and dependent on local \ninterconnections. Adding water to any control volume will, therefore, not simply change \nthe average water potential but will cause a redistribution of water within the volume over \na certain relaxation time.  The different intra-volume storage states may, in fact,  be \ncompeting for parts of the total storage capacity (as in the unsaturated and saturated \ncomponents of the hillslope control volume of Duffy, 1996).  In general, the changes \ninduced will be nonlinear with respect to both the initial distribution of storage and the \nrate at which water is added.   \n \nThis has long been recognised in the form of the hysteresis commonly observed in soil \nmoisture characteristics, even in small samples (and commonly neglected in \u201cphysically-\nbased\u201d models of soil water).  Various simplified models of hysteresis may be found in \nthe soil physics literature (e.g. Jaynes, 1990), none of which adequately characterise the \nvariety of process mechanisms and time scales that might be involved.  A critical view \nwould suggest that hysteresis, while accepted as a \u201cphysically-based\u201d concept, is a \ndesperate attempt to rescue a soil physics that is already an inadequate description of \nthe effects of structure and connectivity on the relationship between flow and storage in \nreal soils, even at small scales. \n \nWhat then are the implications for a \u201cphysically-based\u201d description at the scale of a \npractical control volume?  Clearly, any intra-volume changes in storage in response to \nchanges in boundary fluxes are going to be complex, more complex than those causing \nthe observed hysteresis in small samples.  Additional heterogeneity of inputs and soil \ncharacteristics, preferential flow pathways, differences of local wave speeds relative to \nflow velocities, distributions of active roots etc. will be involved, while distances and time \nscales for the redistribution processes will be greater. A simple Darcian, or hysteretic \nDarcian description can be considered as one possible way of defining the nature of the \nfluxes on the basis of a simplified \u201cphysics\u201d assuming a single intra-volume storage \nstate.  \n \nThe simplest, first order, means of closing the dependencies of equation (2) is to \nassume that all the fluxes are a function of storage alone.  A unique relationship \nbetween storage and flux leads to the kinematic wave equation that has been widely \nused as an approximation in hydrological modelling for both surface and subsurface \nprocesses (Eagleson, 1970; Singh, 1996; Beven, 2001).  However, as for the mass \nbalance equation itself, neither storage nor flux can generally be measured directly so \nthe adequacy or inadequacy of such a description can only be inferred indirectly on the \nbasis of predictions of observable quantities such as catchment discharge.  Such \npredictions will, however, require the specification of both boundary conditions and \nparameter values which also cannot be measured directly or estimated on the basis of \ntheoretical reasoning.  Thus, even with such a first order description there is a necessary \ndependence on the circular process of parameter calibration and more \u201ccomplete\u201d \ndescriptions (for example, accounting for the time variable \u201chysteretic\u201d dependence of \nfluxes on storage in the control volume) will have a greater dependence on calibration. \n \nThus, there are in fact two problems to be solved in the application of (2) in any \nAlternative Blueprint.  The first is the nature of the intra- and inter-volume dependencies; \nthe second is the calibration of the parameter values given a certain set of observables.  \nFor the present, we will assume that (2) may be written as \n \n\u222b \u222b \u222b \u222b\u222b\u222b\u222b \u222b\u222b\u222b \u00b1= dVdtSedxdtSqdVdtdS )()(     (3)  \n \nwhere  )S( represents a dependence on a set of storage states in both space (including \nintra-volume states) and earlier times.   We note that, at the current time and at control \nvolume scales of hydrological interest, S cannot be generally considered an observable, \nnor can any intra-volume storage states other than at local point scales.  This clearly has \nimportant implications for both the definition of a physically-based model structure and \nfor the identification of any parameter values involved in the definition. \n \nDefining the model space: the use of a conservation of energy principle \n \nThe obvious additional physical principle to invoke at this point is the conservation of \nenergy (e.g. Reggiani et al., 1998).  The primary driving forces for hydrological systems \nare the distribution of potential energy of precipitation inputs as dominated by the \ncatchment topography, and the inputs of energy due to radiation from the sun.  As with \nstorage, in principle an energy balance can be defined for any control volume in the \nsystem; in practice the energy states of the water are not directly observable at other \nthan the point scale.  Any such energy balance will inevitably involve some energy loss \ncoefficients, to reflect the effects of friction and laminar and turbulent shear, that require \nknowledge of the geometry and characteristics of the flow paths that will generally not be \navailable, except in the simplest cases.   This has required in previous analyses, such as \nthat of the FH69 Blueprint,  that bulk energy loss coefficients be used in model definition \n(as in the uniform flow equations of channel flow, in the interpretation of the hydraulic \nconductivity as an inverse head loss coefficient, and in the canopy resistance \ncoefficients of evapotranspiration models). More complex expositions are currently under \ndevelopment (e.g. Ewen, 1996; Germann and Di Pietro, 1999) but, as yet, are lacking in \nthat they do not specify how the energy loss coefficients might generally be specified \nexcept by the circular process of back-calculation from measured fluxes (and then only \nfor scales for which this is technically possible). \n \nModel descriptions based on conservation of energy have been relatively successful for \nchannelled surface flows, despite the fact that only an approximate energy balance \naccounting in terms of the total momentum of the flow is normally done.   The accounting \nis implicit in the specification of an appropriate roughness coefficient in a specific form of \nvelocity equation (and commonly ignores external energy sources as negligible).  Such \ndescriptions have also been relatively successful for well-connected saturated \nsubsurface flows for which energy gradients are also relatively well defined.  It has also \nbeen applied (usually in a totally uncritical way) to irregular overland flows (under a \nsheet flow assumption) and poorly connected flows in the unsaturated zone.  In these \ncases, the approach does not (as yet) appear to provide an adequate answer to an \nAlternative Blueprint.  In any control volume there could be a wide range of concurrent \ntotal energy states and it is simply too difficult to define the energy loss coefficients \ninvolved. \n \nThis is a further indication that deductive reasoning based on physical reasoning alone is \nnot a sufficient means of defining a useful model of a complex catchment system.  The \nneed to reflect the unique nature of that catchment in terms of storage or energy loss \ncoefficients necessarily requires consideration of what is also observable (Beven, 2000).   \n \nDefining the model space: the choice of an appropriate scale of control volume    \n \nThe classical Darcian description of subsurface flow has associated with it a lower scale \nlimit  for the continuum description, the Representative Elementary  Volume (REV).  This \nlimit (often discussed but never, to my knowledge, precisely defined for a particular soil) \nis the scale at which an effective soil water potential within some local population of pore \nspaces is meaningful.  It is therefore also closely related to the scale over which any \naverage potential gradient might be meaningful.  No equivalent concept for overland \nflows appears to have been formulated.  It is not necessary if a simple average depth or \nstorage-flow function assumption already ignores any real effects of the irregularity of \ndepths and velocities within a flow, except in so far as they might have an effect on an \neffective roughness coefficient. \n \nWhat is not often recognised is that, as well as this lower scale limit,  there must also be \nan upper limit to the utility of an average potential and potential gradient due to the \neffects of soil or rock structure and heterogeneity.  What work that has been done in this \narea has concentrated on trying to retain the concept of the average potential and \ngradient and to formulate a heterogeneity and scale dependent resistance coefficient by \nmeans of a statistical generalisation of the intra-volume heterogeneity (see for example \nDagan for the case of saturated flows).  There would appear to be two problems in \napplying the available theory.  The first is that it requires very specific assumptions to be \nmade about the nature of the heterogeneity.  However, the equifinality problem may then \narise again in terms of different parameterisations of those assumptions or different \nalternative sets of assumptions might give equally acceptable predictions.  The second, \nand more important, is that the assumption of an average potential gradient as a control \nfor fluxes between control volumes will have limited utility in situations where average \npotentials and potential gradients are rapidly varying within a control volume.  This will \ngenerally be more significant in unsaturated flow than saturated flow, but even in \nsaturated systems boreholes in close proximity may yield significantly different apparent \npiezometric heads as a result of poor hydraulic linkages or, perhaps, poor installation \ntechniques. \n \nAt larger scales, therefore, if the concept of an average potential gradient is not  \nphysically meaningful, the only variable that might be used as the basis for a description \nis the storage in the control volume.  This is an absolute physical quantity, which must \nbe subject to the mass balance equation, but which will necessarily have a complex \nrelationship, hysteretic and scale dependent, with the inter-volume fluxes.  Use of control \nvolume storage does not, in fact, arbitrarily restrict the discretisation scales that can be \nconsidered in a physically-based description.  Even the catchment scale could be used if \na proper scale dependent physically-based representation of the effects of intra-\ncatchment variability on boundary fluxes could be found.  The FH69 Blueprint can be \nconsidered, in effect, one such complex representation.  There have, of course, been \nmany attempts at lumped representations of the catchment as control volume in the \npast, with more or less physical basis, but with demonstrated success in practical \nprediction (at least after calibration).   \n \nA catchment scale description might not be adequate, however, if the application \nrequires spatially distributed predictions or predictions that reflect the effects of spatially \ndistributed change in the catchment.  Where distributed predictions are required, this line \nof argument would therefore appear to lead towards the use of subdivisions of the \ncatchment into units with similar functioning, or that are, in some sense, hydrologically \nsimilar.  A crucial question in this context is then: if every point in the catchment has its \nown unique characteristics how can different points be hydrologically similar?  We will \nreturn to that question later. \n \nThe theory of Reggiani et al. (1999) as an Alternative Blueprint \n \nA recent highly ambitious attempt to reformulate the theory of hydrological systems in a \nformal way, that takes explicit account of scale dependencies is due to Reggiani et al. \n(1998, 1999, 2000).   They formulate conservation equations for mass, energy and \nmomentum and invoke additional entropy constraints for different process sub-domains \nwithin an arbitrary hydrological sub-unit of the landscape that they call a \u201crepresentative \nelementary watershed\u201d (REW).  They define the REW as essentially the area draining to \na link in the channel network, although it would seem possible to extend this definition to \nlarger sub-catchment units.  Their formulation, after a series of simplifying assumptions, \nleads to a determinate system of 13 nonlinear coupled balance equations plus 10 \ngeometric relationships in as many unknowns (further work to include evapotranspiration \nprocesses within the same framework remains to be done).   \n Their work serves as an Alternative Blueprint to FH69 in its own right.  One of the most \nimportant aspects of their development is that it is derived directly at the scale of the \nREW.  This approach, therefore, is not based on a direct extension of small scale theory \nto the larger scale that is implicit in FH69.  The equations are derived and solved at the \nREW scale, as demonstrated in non-dimensional form in Reggiani et al. (2000).  \nHowever, it is important to recognise that the balance equations alone are indeterminate \n(10 coupled equations in 16 unknowns), and that the additional simplifying assumptions \nare crucial to the closure of the system.  Of these additional assumptions, the most \ncrucial are the constitutive relationships for the fluxes within and between REW units \n(Reggiani et al., 1999).  The assumptions made in their initial formulations are that for \nunsaturated and saturated zone flows, frictional energy losses are a linear function of \nvelocity, while for overland and channel flow, frictional energy losses are a function of \nvelocity squared.  These are in keeping with the small scale process equations of \nDarcy\u2019s Law for porous medium flow and uniform flow relationships (Manning, Chezy, \nDarcy-Weisbach) for overland and channel flow.  The theory does not depend on these \nparticular constitutive relationships and Reggiani et al. (1999, 2000) stress that other \nforms could be used where more appropriate. \n \nSomething is still lacking, however, from this theory as an Alternative Blueprint.  The \nconstitutive  relationships required for closure involve coefficients (that may be nonlinear \ntime dependent coefficients in the case of some of the sub-domain flow processes) and \nReggiani et al. have conspicuously avoided specifying how these coefficients might be \nidentified at the REW scale.  The problem is, in effect, analogous to that of the very \ndifficult closure schemes for descriptions of inhomogeneous turbulence where both the \nscale dependent dissipation of energy with the flow and the pattern of energy dissipation \nat the boundaries of the flow interact.  In fact, the catchment problem may be more \ndifficult because the constitutive relations for different flow processes will be a function of \nthe detailed geometry of flow pathways that will remain unknowable for the foreseeable \nfuture.  The theory then leads to a difficult identification problem, involving at least one or \ntwo coefficients for each sub-domain within each REW within the catchment, when there \nis no (current) possibility of direct measurement of flux, energy and momentum at the \nREW scale (or even state variables such as average potentials and total storage in each \nsub-domain, etc).   \n  \nTheory evaluation:  what is \u201cphysically-based\u201d? \n \nThe aim of this paper is to provide an Alternative Blueprint for a physically-based \nhydrological response model.   This requires that a definition of \u201cphysically-based\u201d be \nunderstood.  30 years ago, perhaps this was not such a problem.  Physically-based \nshould mean derived deductively from established physical principles, as defined by \nappropriate assumptions and laws.  The FH69 model, albeit a gross simplification of the \nNavier-Stokes equations, is physically-based in this sense.  The approach of Reggiani et \nal. (1998, 1999) is also physically-based in this sense.  The assumptions and laws of the \nhydrological scale descriptions might be questioned, shown to be wanting and improved.  \nThat is how the science should progress. \n \nConsistency with defined theoretical assumptions, however,  is a necessary but not a \nsufficient condition for accepting that a model is physically-based.  Physically-based \nshould also imply consistency with observations.  If consistency is not demonstrated the \ntheory, or the nature of its application, must be wanting (or the observations must be in \nerror or only locally representative).  The FH69 model, as applied, is often wanting in this \nrespect and is therefore no more physically-based than other possible descriptions \nbased on principles of mass and energy conservation but defined in terms of variables at \ndifferent (larger) time and space scales.  It has also been shown how the approach of \nReggiani et al. may be deficient in this respect, in that it is not clear that the coefficients \ninvoked in the closure assumptions are identifiable in any particular application. \n \nIt seems to be necessary to differentiate between physically-based in the sense of being \nbased on defined assumptions and theory, and physically-based in the sense of being \nconsistent with observations.  The fact that a model may be physically-based in theory \nbut not consistent with observations results primarily from the mismatch in scales \nbetween the scale of the observable state variables and the scale of application.  This \napplies to both the FH69 Blueprint, with its assumption that small scale process \ndescriptions can be applied at larger scales, and the recent Reggiani et al. (1999) theory \nthat is formulated at the scale of the REW but requires the identification of constitutive \nrelationships for energy losses at the REW scale for which the observations are not \ncurrently available.   \nIn catchment hydrology, the need is not so much for a model that is theoretically \nacceptable, but for a model that is consistent with observations at the scale of interest.  \nThe FH69 Blueprint and Reggiani et al. formulation concentrate on the former. The \nAlternative Blueprint proposed here concentrates on the latter: a physically-based model \nis one that is acceptably consistent with the data.  It is important to note that this does \nnot necessarily include all models that are consistent with the observational data alone.  \nWe would not normally consider as acceptable a model that violated physical principles \n(albeit as an approximation to the true physics).  We may also have evidence or \nunderstanding that a model may produce good predictions for what, we believe, are the \nwrong reasons.   In fact, considered honestly, the problem is that this is surely true for all \nthe available models, relative to our qualitative understanding of the processes involved.   \n \nThus, given the limitations of current quantitative hydrological knowledge, this allows for \na wide range of potentially acceptable models in defining the model space (the \nequifinality problem of Beven, 1993, 1996a,b).  A valid starting point, in fact, is a model \nspace that comprises of all models that predict the variables of interest (figure 1).  This \nmight include many of the so-called conceptual models in hydrology, in so far as they \ncan be shown to be acceptable in not violating physical principles or being inconsistent \nwith available observations. If the interest is only in discharge prediction at the \ncatchment outlet, therefore, the model space will be larger than if distributed predictions \nof soil moisture and water tables levels are required.  It will usually be possible to refine \nthis space by a priori argument (including the classic, if occasionally false, argument that \nyour own model must be better than all other models).     \n \n \nAn Alternative Blueprint as method \n \nSo, if there are potentially many models that can be considered as \u201cphysically-based\u201d in \nthe sense used here of both not obviously violating physical principles at the scale of \napplication and being consistent with the observational data available, what is being \nsuggested by the previous discussion?  There clearly can be no single Alternative \nBlueprint, but perhaps there can be a formal method of reasoning to arrive at a \nphysically-based model, or at least eliminate those possibilities that should not be \nconsidered physically-based.  The Alternative Blueprint as method can be stated \nsuccinctly in terms of the following six stages (see Figure 2): \n \n(i) Define the range of model structures to be considered \n(ii) Reject any model structures that cannot be justified as physically feasible a priori \nfor the catchment of interest \n(iii) Define the range for each parameter in each model \n(iv) Reject any parameter combinations that cannot be justified as physically feasible a \npriori \n(v) Compare the predictions of each potential model with the available observed data \n(which may include both discharge and internal state measurements) and reject \nany models which produce unacceptable predictions, taking account of estimated \nerror in the observations. \n(vi) Make the desired predictions with the remaining successful models to estimate the \nrisk of possible outcomes. \n \nThis methodology has much in common with the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty \nEstimation (GLUE) of Beven and Binley (1992, see also Beven et al., 2000; Beven and \nFreer, 2000b; Beven, 2001).  GLUE samples the population of potential models by \nMonte Carlo simulation and adds a stage of weighting the predictions of each successful \nmodel by a likelihood measure in assessing a cumulative distribution of possible \noutcomes, where the likelihood measure depends on how well a model has done in \npredicting observed data in the past.  This is, however, just one possible implementation \nof the six stages of this Alternative Model Blueprint. \n \nIn Stage (i), defining the feasible model structures is the first stage in defining the \u201cmodel \nspace\u201d (Figure 1).  The FH69 Blueprint is one feasible model structure, that might still be \nconsidered for inclusion despite the evidence as to why it should not be considered \nphysically-based in the sense used here, or are there indeed catchments for which its \nsimplifying assumptions are valid?  In most catchments, this evidence would be a reason \nfor rejection at Stage (ii) but, as pointed out above, it is probable that all the currently \navailable models could be rejected for one good physical reason or another.  Since it is \nnot yet possible to describe either flow structures or parameter values unambiguously at \nthe scales of interest, there is potential for a number of competing models at Stage (i).  \nThis could include, for example, different sets of closure assumptions within the \nReggiani et al. (1999) theory. \n \nStage (iii) completes the definition of the model space but in that it is ranges of effective \nparameter values that are required in every model under consideration, then it may not \nbe easy to decide what ranges to specify in Stage (iii), or which combinations of \nparameter values (parts of the model space) to reject in Stage (iv).  This decision will \ncommonly be left to the evaluation of Stage (v) which will determine the set of successful \nmodels.  For ungauged catchments Stages (v) cannot be implemented, making the \nchoice of feasible parameter sets at Stage (iv) that much more important. \n \nNote: that there is no mention of optimisation of models in this methodology.  It is \ntherefore consistent with the evidence of equifinality of models that has come from many \nexplorations of different model spaces (see, for example, Beven et al., 2000).  This does, \nhowever, create a problem of searching the defined model space for the set of models \nthat are feasible.  For model spaces of small dimension, this is not a great problem even \nfor some complex models, using Monte Carlo, structured Monte Carlo or discrete \nsampling strategies.  For large model spaces (many model structures with multiple or \ndistributed parameters) it is a very real practical problem.   It is a problem that has been \nsomewhat mitigated for many problems by the development of parallel computing \nsystems that enable large numbers of model runs to be made relatively cheaply and \nquickly.  However, reliance must still be made on an assumption that a sufficient sample \nof successful models from the model space have been considered to give an appropriate \nrange of predicted outcomes.  At present, implementation of this Alternative Blueprint will \nnot be possible for the most complex distributed hydrological models (although \nexperiments are already being carried out with the SHE model and with a distributed \ngroundwater transport model). \n \nEquifinality, theory falsification and hypothesis testing in hydrology \n \nMy argument thus far is therefore that there may be many models of the catchment \nhydrological system that are physically-based in the sense that they do not violate \nphysical principles and that may be consistent with the limited observables.  Qualitative \nunderstanding of small scale hydrological processes is not the problem here, it is the \nimplementation of that understanding at larger scales to specific, unique, catchments \nthat leads to many different acceptable modelling possibilities.  This type of modelling \nequifinality is a generic problem.  It would be a problem even in the case where we had \na \u201ctrue\u201d model description but had to identify appropriate parameter sets for a specific \nsite given only limited observational information.   There will still be many parameter sets \nthat would prove to be consistent with the data available. \n \nIn one sense, the problem of equifinality can be considered a problem of decidability.  \nWe will only be forced to accept that there must be multiple model representations of \nhydrological systems if we cannot decide between them in some way, other than the \ntraditional, but rather arbitrary, practice of only considering, a priori, one model and one \n\u201coptimal\u201d set of parameters in that model.   If we could decide that one set of models is \nnot an adequate description of the system under study, then clearly we should be \nrejecting that set of models.  Theoretical and observational limitations may make such \ndecisions difficult but, in principle, it is possible to work within such a falsificationist \nframework. \n \nThe problems of falsification and decidability are traditional problems in science and \nhave been the subject of considerable philosophical discussion.  Note that it is not being \nsuggested that any large scale hydrological descriptions need be considered as true \ndescriptions of reality.   That must surely be considered as currently impossible in \nmodelling most open environmental systems.  We can therefore avoid many of the \nphilosophical criticisms of crude falsification (as outlined in a hydrological context, for \nexample, by Oreskes et al., 1994).   In fact, the approach we are suggesting is much \nmore a relativistic approach, within which some of the feasible models are considered to \nbe more likely than others but where falsification can be used as a means of reducing \nthe range of possibilities.  Thus, given multiple working hypotheses (competing models) \nwhat is the best decidable hypothesis test to differentiate between them and reject some \nof the multiple possibilities?  A critical test is potentially a very effective constraint in \nreducing the set of feasible models but not all the hypotheses that we could pose will be \ntestable given the observational techniques available.   \n \nIn the past history of science, of course, there have some hypotheses posed on the \nbasis of deductive reasoning that have not been testable until appropriate observational \ntechniques have been developed.  This has been a significant encouragement for the \ndevelopment of measurement technology.   Could the same be true in hydrology? Or, as \nhas been the case in many other subject areas, will the development of better theory \nfollow the development of new measurement techniques? \n \nAre there valuable hypotheses that are not yet testable in hydrology?  Unfortunately, \nsince we cannot even firmly close the areal water balance equation in hydrology, the \nanswer is yes, even for the most fundamental hypotheses.   In hydrological modelling, \none of the most important hypotheses to test would have to be the assumed nature of \nthe fluxes between control volumes under different conditions.  This would require either \na direct measurement technique for water fluxes at the chosen control volume scale, or \nmeasurements of water storage for the control volume as a whole or as different \ncomponent storages, together with the boundary conditions, from which the magnitudes  \nof the inter-volume fluxes could be (approximately) inferred.  These measurements \ncannot currently be made at the scales required (with the exception of catchment \ndischarge measurements where the control volume is at the catchment scale, but other \ncatchment scale boundary fluxes, especially evapotranspiration from a control volume \ncannot easily be measured).     \n \nAre there more limited hypotheses that can be tested using currently available \nmeasurement techniques?  That macropore fluxes are important at the control volume \n(or REW) scale?  That the fast response of a catchment is dominated by infiltration \nexcess overland flow?  That energy losses for subsurface flows are a linear function of \nan effective mean velocity in a heterogeneous soil?  That energy losses for surface flows \nare a function of an effective mean velocity squared on a complex surface topography?  \nThat valley bottom storage plays an important role in shaping surface hydrographs?  \nThat recharges to groundwaters are dominated by short periods of high fluxes?  Many \nhypotheses can be envisaged (though not all easily testable) that would have value in \nthis type of evaluation context. \n \n \n \nConclusions: Mathematical complexity and observational capability \n \nThere is a certain prestige in science associated with the use of complex mathematics.  \nDifficult sciences, such as biology, ecology, hydrology and other environmental sciences \noften aspire to demonstrate progress and maturity by more advanced mathematical \ndescriptions.  Until the FH69 Blueprint, it had not been necessary for hydrologists to \nworry much about partial differential equations and their analytical and numerical \nsolution, if only because of computational constraints.  This was still the era of using \nelectrical analogue computers for the solution of the Laplace equation as an \napproximate description of steady state groundwater flow (see IAHS, 1968).   \n \nComputing constraints are now much less critical for many problems of great practical \ninterest, but  with hindsight there would appear to be more important problems in \ntheoretical hydrology than increasing mathematical complexity.   This is not to deny that \nphysical descriptions of hydrological processes might not need to be complex but \nmathematical complexity can also imply constraint.  The FH69 Blueprint is constrained \nby its assumptions to a Darcian description of subsurface flow.  A more general Darcian \ndescription of flow in soil with heterogeneous characteristics will be constrained by the \nassumptions made about the nature of the heterogeneity (and introduces additional \nparameters to be determined).  Unless those assumptions can be shown independently \nto be valid, within the context of uniqueness of place and the limitations of available \ndata, they may result in inappropriate constraints on predictions.   \n \nEvaluation of assumptions, regardless of mathematical complexity, is then a matter  of \nobservational capability.  It is therefore appropriate that we should return at the end of \nthis description of an Alternative Blueprint as method, to a focus on observation. To state \na need for improved observational capability is not new, but the Alternative Blueprint that \nhas been outlined here has an explicit role for observation in conditioning the model \nspace and model rejection that was lacking in the FH69 version.  There, prior \nassumption and theory was emphasised.  The Alternative Blueprint has been presented \nhere with essentially no equations.  The exposition of the mass continuity equation \nserves only to highlight some of the problems encountered in defining a physically-based \nmodel at the scales required.  It is, however, no less an \u201cartist\u2019s conception\u201d of a \nBlueprint for a way of working than was the more mathematical Freeze and Harlan \nversion 30 years ago. \n \nPhysically-based theory must be consistent with observations.  In this sense the FH69, \nas applied in current models, is often not consistent with process observations and is not \ntherefore physically-based. In a science where unique local characteristics so affect local \nobservations as to make the application of small scale physical theory intractable at the \nlarger scale, we must look to alternative larger scale descriptions and must recognise \nthat there may be many possible descriptions that provide equally good predictions of \nthe observations.  The real challenge is to find creative ways of using observations to \nlimit those possibilities.  The Alternative Blueprint described here provides one way of \nformalising that process. \n \n \nReferences \nAbbot, M. B., Bathurst, J. C., Cunge, J. A., O'Connell, P.

Note that model structure (Model 1, Model 2, \u2026Model N) \nacts as one dimension of choice.  P1, P2, P3, represent 3 of perhaps many parameter \ndimensions.  There may be different dimensions for different model structures but \neach model should predict all variables of interest (if not, this may provide one \njustification for rejection). \n \nFigure 2  Stages in the Alternative Blueprint for Physically-Based Modelling. \n"}
