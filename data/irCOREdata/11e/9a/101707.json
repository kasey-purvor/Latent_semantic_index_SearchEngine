This paper defines crises and disasters before \ndiscussing the area of crisis and disaster management. The paper then applies the foot \nand mouth outbreak which occurred in the United Kingdom to the tourism disaster \nframework proposed by Faulkner (2001). The paper notes that although the outbreak \nfits the basic principles of Faulkner\u2019s (2001) model the size, scope, and subsequent \nmanagement of the outbreak over an extended period suggests that although the \nmodel is useful, it has limited usefulness because not all disasters and crises are the \nsame. Nevertheless, by examining how crises and disasters are managed, lessons for \ndestinations and organisations may help turn such incidents into positive forces for \nchange and help to reduce the severity of future disasters. \n \nKeywords: Tourism, Disaster, Crisis, Event, United Kingdom \n \nIntroduction \nIn February 2001, the first case of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) was confirmed in \nthe UK since an outbreak of the disease in 1967.  A total of 2030 cases of the disease \nwere identified and a total of over 4 million animals were culled during the crisis with \nworldwide media broadcasts showing burning carcasses of culled animals. The \nEnglish Tourism Council (ETC) have predicted that losses to English tourism in 2001 \nwould be \u00a35bn, while in 2002 and 2003 reductions would total \u00a32.5bn and \u00a31bn \nrespectively (ETC, 2001a).  On January 15th 2002 government officials announced \n 2 \nthat the disease had finally been defeated after 11 months of battling the outbreak. \nDespite the end of the disease, the outbreak has deeply affected the farming and \ntourism industry and raised questions concerning government policy toward both the \nfarming and tourism industry.  Although the outbreak was not expected, questions \nhave been specifically raised concerning the responsiveness and preparedness of the \nentire UK tourism industry for the falling numbers that resulted from FMD.  Faulkner \n(2001) notes there are an increasing number of disasters and crises which affect the \ntourism industry, ranging from natural to human influenced disasters.  This has been \nmade most evident since the events of September 11th 2001, which has dramatically \nimpacted upon the tourism industry illustrating the need to understand and effectively \nmanage such incidents.   \n \nFaulkner (2001) argues that there is a lack of research on disaster phenomena in the \ntourism industry, on the impacts of such events on both the industry and specific \norganisations, and the responses of the tourism industry to disasters.  Yet Lee and \nHarrald (1999:184) note that crisis management, disaster recovery, and organisational \ncontinuity are important competencies for managers in both the public and private \nsector.  This paper aims to address these deficiencies as well as to consider FMD in \nthe light of the framework for analysing and understanding tourism disasters \ndeveloped by Faulkner (2001).  More specifically the paper examines the \nframework\u2019s applicability to the foot and mouth outbreak at a national level before \nexamining the response of an individual organisation (the Cheltenham Horseracing \nAssociation) who manage an annual sporting event, the Cheltenham Festival.  The \nCheltenham Festival was chosen for analysis because the town of Cheltenham is \nindicative of the move towards an economy dominated by tourism in a rural area \n 3 \ntraditionally dominated by farming.  Thus, although Cheltenham and its surrounding \narea did not suffer the highest incidence of FMD, the economy of Cheltenham had \ncome to be highly reliant on the tourism industry (and events in particular) and thus \nplaced itself in a position vulnerable to disasters.   \n \nAn examination of the management of the outbreak may provide assistance to other \ndestinations and organisations in developing crisis management strategies to deal with \nunforeseen events such as disasters and crises.  First some discussion of crisis \nmanagement definitions and crisis management theory is required.  \n \nCrisis and Disaster Definitions \nA number of authors have attempted to define a crisis to help improve their \nunderstanding of this phenomenon. Pauchant and Mitroff (1992:15) believe that a \ncrisis is a \u201cdisruption that physically affects a system as a whole and threatens its \nbasic assumptions, its subjective sense of self, its existential core.\u201d Selbst (1978 in \nFaulkner 2001:136) defines a crisis as \u201cany action or failure to act that interferes with \nan organisation\u2019s ongoing functions, the acceptable attainment of its objectives, its \nviability or survival, or that has a detrimental personal effect as perceived by the \nmajority of its employees, clients or constituents.\u201d Faulkner (2001) considers the \nprincipal distinction between what can be termed a \u201ccrisis\u201d and a \u201cdisaster\u201d to be the \nextent to which the situation is attributable to the organisation itself, or can be \ndescribed as originating outside the organisation.  Thus, a \u201ccrisis\u201d describes a \nsituation \u201cwhere the root cause of an event is, to some extent, self-inflicted through \nsuch problems as inept management structures and practices or a failure to adapt to \nchange\u201d, while a \u201cdisaster can be defined as \u201cwhere an enterprise\u2026is confronted with \n 4 \nsudden unpredictable catastrophic changes over which it has little control\u201d (Faulkner \n2001:136).  This enables the production of a simple matrix (see figure 1). \n \nFigure 1: Conceptualising Crises and Disasters \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Faulkner (2001) \n \n \nThe implication of whether a situation can be described as a crisis or a disaster is \ncrucial in designing response options and also the ability to reflect on the situation and \nmake changes subsequent to the negative events.  A crisis implies the need for change \nto prevent the situation occurring again, while a disaster requires responses to limit \nthe impacts should there be a repeat occurrence.  However, FMD can be considered as \nboth a disaster and a crisis depending on the perspective taken.  Therefore, while the \nprecise causes of FMD are a source of much disagreement, factors such as lax import \nregulations, a (general, though not exclusive) resistance to vaccination and a \ncollapsing market are suggested as potential causes that designate FMD as a farming \ncrisis.  Yet, as none of the factors instrumental in the outbreak of FMD could be \ninfluenced by the tourism industry, FMD was a disaster that threatened an industry \nworth \u00a352.2bn per year to the UK economy (4% of GDP, the UK\u2019s fifth biggest \nindustry) and employs 1.7million people.  A total of 150,000 jobs were thought to be \nIn d u ced  b y  th e  action s or \nin action s o f  th e  organ isa tion\nIn d u ced  b y  n atu ra l p h en om en a  \nor  ex tern a l h u m an  action\nS ca le or\nM agn itu d e\nO f th e  even t\nC h ern ob y l\nD isastersC rises\nL ock erb ieE xxon  V a ld ez\nK ob e E arth q u ak e\nK ath er in e  F lood s\n(A u stra lia )\nS w iss C an yon  \nIn c id en t\n \n 5 \ndirectly at risk and 3,000 small rural tourism business faced the threat of failure (ETC, \n2001a).  The classification of FMD is made more complex by understanding the \ndiversification in recent years by farmers towards tourism as a way of regulating \nfarming incomes that have fallen by 75% over the last three years to their lowest \nlevels since the 1930s (Cook, 1999).  Thus, a farmer diversified into tourism can be \nboth cause and effect, the precipitator of crisis and a victim of disaster.  The difficulty \nof this position is enunciated in a later section, which explores recovery options from \nthe disease.   \n \n \nCrisis Management \nLee and Harrald (1999:184) state that \u201cnatural disasters can disrupt the supply and \ndistribution chains for even the best prepared businesses\u2026service businesses are \nincreasingly vulnerable to electrical, communication and other critical infrastructure \nfailures.\u201d  Kash and Darling (1998:179) agree, and claim that it is no longer a case \u2018if\u2019 \na business will face a crisis; it is rather a question of \u2018when\u2019, \u2018what type\u2019 and \u2018how \nprepared\u2019 the company is to deal with it.  Both statements illustrate that although \norganisations are able to design pre-crisis strategies to help with crisis management \nthey are often unable to prevent a crisis from occurring. However, the real challenge \nis not to recognise crises, but to recognise them in a timely fashion (Darling et al., \n1996). Authors such as Burnett (1998) and Kash and Darling (1998) note that \ndecisions undertaken before a crisis occurs will enable more effective management of \nthe crisis, rather than organisations being managed by the crisis itself. Proactive \nplanning through the use of strategic planning for crises will help reduce risk, time \nwastage, poor resource management and reduce the impacts of those that do arise \n(Heath, 1998).   \n 6 \n \nFurthermore, Heath (1998:9) noted \u201cthe ability of a crisis to cause other crisis \nsituations is termed the ripple effect because these crises seem to fan outward.\u201d Heath \n(1998) believed that effective and well planned crisis management strategies were \nneeded to prevent or limit the \u2018ripple effect\u2019 or chaos associated with crisis incidents. \nIn other words, crisis management is crucial not only for scoping potential crises but \nalso for limiting their impacts on other organisations, destinations or specific industry \nsectors. \n \nThe literature generally has discussed the nature of crises and disasters and\/or \ndiscussed crisis management strategies for dealing more effectively with these \ninstances.  According to Coombs (1999) a list can be developed to illustrate possible \ntypes of crises individual organisations may face and the nature of these crises (see \ntable 1).  \n 7 \n \n \nTable 1: Typology of crises and their characteristics \n \nType of crises Characteristics \nNatural Disasters -When an organisation is damaged as a result of the weather or \u2018acts \nof God.\u2019 Examples include earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, \nand bad storms. \nMalevolence -When some outside actor or opponent employs extreme tactics to \nexpress anger toward the organisation or to force the organisation to \nchange. Examples include product tampering, kidnapping, terrorism \nand espionage. \nHuman Breakdowns -When human error causes disruptions. Examples include industrial \naccidents and product recalls. \nChallenges -When the organisation is confronted by discontented stakeholders. \nThe stakeholders challenge the organisation because they believe it is \noperating in an appropriate manner and does not meet their \nexpectations. Examples include boycotts, strikes, lawsuits, \ngovernment penalties and protests. \nMegadamage -When an accident causes significant environmental damage. \nExamples include oil spills and radioactive contamination. \nOrganisational Misdeeds -When management takes actions it knows will harm or serve to \ndiscredit or disgrace the organisation in some way. Examples include \nfavouring short-term economic gain over social values, deliberate \ndeception of stakeholders and illegal acts by management. \nWorkplace Violence -When an employee or former employee commits violence against \nother employees on organisational grounds. Examples include killing \nor injuring co-workers. \nRumours -When false information is spread about an organisation or its \nproducts. The false information hurts the organisation\u2019s reputation by \nputting the organisation in an unfavourable light. Examples include \nrumours linking the organisation to radical groups or stories that their \nproducts are contaminated. \nSource: Modified after Coombs (1999:61-62). \n \n \nAlthough typologies are useful for beginning to understand the nature of crises, the \nvery nature of crises makes it difficult to fully understand them.  Coombs (1999) \nnotes, all crises are different and crisis managers need to tailor responses to individual \ncrises rather than try to plan for every individual situation. Heath (1998:272) agrees \nand states that \u201cno crisis has exactly the same form, the same time limitations, the \nsame demand for resources\u2026or the same temporal, social and economic threats.\u201d  \nThis indicates the difficulty in developing typologies and theories to understand crisis \nmanagement and how to prevent or limit the effects of crises.  Authors such as Kash \nand Darling (1998) believe that although crises management is a requirement for all \n 8 \norganisations and that business leaders recognise the concept of crisis management, \nmany do not undertake productive steps to address crisis situations.  \n \nOther crisis management research has focussed on the stages of crises to assist in \nunderstanding crisis phenomenon and assist in proactive and strategic management of \ncrises (see Richardson, 1994; 1995).  Fink (1986) and Roberts (1994) both developed \nslightly different models to explain the lifecycle of crises (see table 2).  Fink\u2019s (1986) \nmodel suggested a four phase anatomy of a crisis outlined in figure 2, but also noted \nthat due to the nature of crises \u2018chaos\u2019 may be a more accurate depiction of a crisis \nfrom an individual perspective (see figure 3).  \n \nFigure 2: What One Crisis Cycle May Look Like \n \n \nSource: Fink (1986) \n \n \n 9 \nFigure 3: What Crisis Cycles Often Look or Feel Like to the Individual \n \n \n \nSource: Fink (1986) \n \n \nFrom the work of Fink (1986) and Roberts (1994) Faulkner (2001) developed the first \ntourism specific disaster management framework and subsequently applied this \nframework to the Katherine Floods in Australia (see Faulkner & Vikulov, 2001).  \nTable 2 outlines the basis to the framework that Faulkner (2001) developed which \nwill be applied, later in this paper, to the FMD in the UK and the response of the \ntourism industry and the Chelteham Horseracing Association. \n \n 10 \nTable 2: The crisis and disaster lifecycle \n \nFaulkner\u2019s (2001) stages Fink\u2019s (1986) stages Robert\u2019s (1994) stages \n1.

Long term (recovery) Chronic stage: clean-up, \npost-mortem, self-analysis \nand healing \nLong-term phase: \ncontinuation of the previous \nphase, but items that could \nnot be addressed quickly are \nattended to at this point \n(repair of damaged \ninfrastructure, correcting \nenvironmental problems, \ncounselling victims, \nreinvestment strategies, \ndebriefings to provide input \nto revisions of disaster \nstrategies) \n6. Resolution Resolution: routine restored \nor new improved state \n \nSource: After Faulkner (2001:140). \n \n \nAlthough understanding the type of crisis and the stages of a crisis are important, \nunderstanding how to manage crises is critical.  Heath (1998) identified two major \napproaches concerning the management of crises: the traditional crisis management \napproach and the risk management approach.  The traditional crisis management \napproach involves no initial (pre-crisis) planning or management as the approach \nbegins when the crisis starts (see figure 4).  The approach of the risk management \napproach is to respond to the crisis and manage the impacts effectively and efficiently.  \n 11 \nThe evaluation, risk assessment and crisis planning does not occur until after the crisis \nevent (post-crisis) and the findings are then kept for future reference.   \n \nFigure 4: A Traditional Approach to a Crisis  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Heath (1998). \n \nThe risk management approach follows on from the traditional crisis management \napproach as it starts where the other finishes and is concerned with assessing and \nmanaging risk before a crisis begins (pre-crisis).  It is then in the position to \nimplement appropriate response and recovery plans as the crisis emerges (see figure \n5).  Again, similar to the first approach, learning and feedback are crucial \nrequirements for the development of future crisis management planning.  \n \nFigure 5: A Risk Management Approach to a Crisis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Heath (1998). \nCrisis risk assessments. \nResponse and recovery \nplanning. \nCrisis situation. \nResponse and recovery \nplans implemented. \nFeedback \u2013 learning from \nexperience, risk identification, \nplanning & preparedness for \nfuture crises \nCrisis event\/outbreak Response onset and \nimpact management \nLearning \u2013 the identification \nof risks, planning & \npreparedness for future crises \n 12 \n \n \n \nWith the previous crisis management and tourism disaster management theory in \nmind, the authors undertook research to examine the FMD in the UK and assess the \nresponse of both the tourism industry generally, and the response of an organisation, \nthe Cheltenham Horseracing Association.  Secondary research was undertaken by \nexamining newspaper articles throughout the duration of the foot and mouth outbreak. \nHowever, particular emphasis was placed on the analysis of \u2018broadsheet\u2019 newspapers \nfrom the beginning of the outbreak in February 2001 until September 2001 when the \nnumber of outbreaks was reduced to a very small number. Analysis was undertaken \nthrough examining the content of messages within the newspaper articles and the \nreporting angle of the newspaper media.  The four main broadsheet newspapers cross \nthe political spectrum, and thus the authors were vigilant for political bias being \nintroduced into the research. Other secondary documents such as British Tourist \nAuthority briefing papers and media releases by the tourism industry and English \nTourism Council were also examined and analysed looking for themes and recurrent \nissues.   \n \nPrimary research was carried out through a semi-structured in depth interview format \nwith the Managing Director of the Cheltenham Horseracing Association (Edward \nGillespie). The interview with Gillespie lasted over 2 hours and was tape recorded and \ntranscribed.  The data gathered from both the secondary and primary collection stages \nwas analysed and an attempt was made to place key themes and issues within \nFaulkner\u2019s (2001) tourism disaster management framework.  \n \n 13 \nBy examining the responses of the tourism industry and critically evaluating the FMD \ninsights may be gained to assist with future crisis management in the UK and \noverseas.  Furthermore, the paper will consider FMD in the light of the framework for \nanalysing tourism disasters developed by Faulkner (2001) and critique the \napplicability of this framework for understanding the FMD.  However, first \nbackground on the Cheltenham Horseracing Association is presented to set the \ncontext for subsequent sections of the paper.   \n \n \nCheltenham and the Cheltenham Horseracing Association \nCheltenham is the principle town within the county of Gloucestershire, which is a \nrural county with a population of less than 500,000 but within easy access of the \nmajor cities of Birmingham and Cardiff, and all the permanent attractions consistent \nwith the second city of England and the capital of Wales.  Cheltenham has therefore \nsought to develop a plethora of festivals to promote tourism.  These festivals include \nthe International Festival of Music, the Festival of Literature, Jazz Festival, Cricket \nFestival and an arts festival.  In 1999, over six million visitors were attracted to \nCheltenham, contributing \u00a3220 million to the town\u2019s economy and helping to support \nover 6,000 jobs (Cheltenham Borough Council 2002).  For the county of \nGloucestershire as a whole, 27 million visitors were recorded, contributing \n\u00a3500million and supporting a direct workforce of 18,612, the fourth largest employer \nin the county and responsible for one in ten jobs in Gloucestershire (Gloucestershire \nTourism 2002).  Visitors to Cheltenham therefore generate nearly half the tourism \nrevenue for the county and the Cheltenham Festival is the largest single contributor to \ntourism in Cheltenham, demonstrating the prominent role that the three-day Festival \nhas in the local economy.   \n 14 \n \nDuring the winter season, 10,000 of the 250,000 attendees to races stay overnight in \nGloucestershire, while for the Festival, 10,000 of the 60,000 daily customers and staff \nremain overnight, making available accommodation extremely difficult to find during \nthe Festival.  A fully booked accommodation stock for the 3-day Festival would \ncontribute around \u00a31.5million to the Cheltenham economy, gate receipts are equal to \napproximately \u00a34.5million and a conservative estimate of spending at \u00a375 per person \nper visit would give a total direct contribution to the local economy of over \n\u00a317million.  No formal attempt has been made to measure the benefits enjoyed by the \ntown or the county as a result of the Festival, although it is felt that the expansion of \nthe November meetings and the addition of Sunday racing to the schedule has \nencouraged racegoers to stay overnight and further explore the county.   \n \nThe main activity of the Cheltenham Horseracing Association is the hosting of an \nannual horseracing festival called the Cheltenham Festival.  The Festival is second \nonly in the UK to the Grand National in the national hunt racing calendar, and lists \nitself as one of the top ten sporting events in the UK.  The racecourse, in a rural part \nof the west of England, contains the biggest corporate entertainment area for any \nBritish sporting event.  The Festival has been organised in its current format since \n1948 and today is held over three days in March and comprises twenty races with \nprize money of over \u00a31m.  The largest race is the Gold Cup, which takes place on the \nfinal day of the Festival and attracts prize money of \u00a3290,000.  Each day of the \nFestival draws capacity crowds of 50,000 \u2013 with the day of the Gold Cup being sold \nout several months in advance.  In 2000, Cheltenham was named the racecourse of the \nyear for the seventh time in eight years by the Racegoers Club.   \n 15 \n \nCheltenham employs 50 staff on a permanent basis, but this number will increase to \nover 1000 on a normal race day and in excess of 5000 per day for the Festival.  \nFigures show Cheltenham racecourse has a turnover of \u00a312m, which includes \u00a311.5m \nfrom racing and \u00a30.5m from non-racing events.  Of the \u00a311.5m from racing, \u00a39m \n(75% of total turnover) is derived from the 3 day festival in March.  From all racing \nthroughout the year, approximately \u00a36m (over 50% of total turnover) comes from the \ncost of admission to the races.  Such ratios signal high reliance on racing for income, \nhigh reliance on the Festival for racing income, high reliance on admissions during \nthe Festival and ultimately high reliance on corporate customers (where hospitality is \nincluded in the admission prices) during the Festival.  The vast majority of these \ntickets are advanced sales.  Media revenues contribute around \u00a31m to turnover (1.3m \nviewers are recorded as watching the Gold Cup live on TV) and the 6500 members \nare worth about \u00a31.2m through their membership fees.  Corporate hospitality and the \nhire of boxes also add a further \u00a31.2m to the racing turnover. \n \nThe outbreak of FMD in February 2001 led to an original intention to proceed with \nthe Festival, as there were no confirmed cases near the racecourse.  Yet the need to \ncomply with guidelines issued by the racing industry\u2019s board of control about FMD \nmeant rescheduling the Festival to take the place of a smaller meeting planned for \nApril.  The veterinary advice received by Cheltenham was that the Festival would \npose no greater risk than a Premiership football match, none of which were cancelled.  \nThis advice was strongly contested by the local farming community, who were \nvocally opposed to the original intended position to continue with the Festival, instead \nwanting to limit as far as possible the number of people visiting the area and therein \n 16 \nincreasing the risk of spreading the disease (Gillespie 2001).  The nature of the Hunt \nracing season meant that dates not conflicting with other courses were scarce and that \nthe ground would not be suitable for hunt racing once into May.  In operational terms, \nMay also carries a heavier number of other sporting fixtures and so reduces the \navailability of the required plant, equipment and staff.    \n \nA further issue was the importance of the Irish racers and horses, the Irish government \nstated that 30 days must elapse after the final outbreak of the disease in the UK before \nracing could resume in Ireland.  Races in Ireland form an important element of the \npreparation for the Festival and thus FMD served to further disjoint the season.  \nHowever a subsequent confirmation of the disease at a farm close to the racecourse \nmeant the abandonment of racing in April and the possibility of simply postponing the \nFestival to a later date.  The Festival was thus cancelled for 2001.   \n \nTourism Disaster Management Framework \nFaulkner\u2019s (2001) uses models by Fink (1986) and Roberts (1994) to identify six \nphases in the process of a tourism disaster.  Each phase will be considered in turn to \nanalyse FMD and its effects on the tourism industry and the Cheltenham Horseracing \nAssociation and the Cheltenham Festival. \n \n \n \nPre-event stage \nThis period represents a time when action can be taken to prevent or mitigate the \neffects of the potential disaster.  In 1967 there was an outbreak of FMD in the UK, \nwhich led to the cancellation of the Grand National, the largest, richest and most \n 17 \nprestigious race of the national hunt season.  However, the effect of thirty four years \non the industry seems to have removed the benefit of experience and been replaced by \na belief that a repetition of the disaster was too unlikely to prepare for.  The \nNorthumberland report into the 1967 outbreak made many conclusions that were \noverlooked in 2001, but the rural environment was very different then to the context \nof the most recent outbreak of the disease.  One of the largest differences is a \ndeclining agricultural production and a downturn in agricultural activities, which has \nnot only impacted upon the local economy of countries but society in general.  \nFurthermore, rural or regional areas have been the regions most vulnerable to this type \nof agricultural decline and restructuring.  As a response to a downturn in agricultural \nactivities in rural regions the government have been promoting new economic \nactivities, including tourism.  Thus, despite the previous outbreak of the disease, the \ngrowth of tourism and its increasing dominance in rural economies has transformed \nthe impacts that could be expected from FMD, making FMD almost a new disaster.  \nThe recency of the growth in the number of tourism businesses and the ascendancy of \nthe tourism industry in rural economies may provide some explanation for the lack of \npreparedness.   \n \nFink (1986) believes that all businesses are \u201con the edge of chaos\u201d and as such should \nbe prepared for uncertainty in order to achieve a greater sense of control.  However, \nthe effect of being struck by a disaster is that events are definitionally beyond the \ncontrol of the organisation, or destination.  This may produce a fatalism that as events \nare external to the organisation there is little that can be done to prevent them and in \nfact often little is done.  According to Kash and Darling (1998:183) \u201crefusing to \nacknowledge a crisis situation is the worst course of action to take.\u201d  While refusing \n 18 \nto acknowledge incidents may be akin to the ostrich sticking its head in the sand, the \ncost of insuring against remote events provides a further incentive to simply hope for \nevents not to repeat themselves.  Cheltenham racecourse was insured for financial loss \nincurred by the cancellation of the Festival, and so exhibited a rare sense of \ncautiousness.  However, the UK has approximately 120,000 tourism business, 77% of \nwhich have a turnover of less than \u00a3250,000 per annum (ETC, 2001a).  The small size \nof the individual businesses in a fragmented industry meant that for many of these \nsmaller businesses, the losses caused by FMD were uninsured and the lessons from \n1967 unlearnt.   \n \nProdromal \nThis phase refers to when it is apparent that a disaster is imminent, but has not yet \nstruck.  For natural disasters, this period of time may be very short and give little \nopportunity for preparation.  For a crisis, the incentive to try to contain the situation \nmay result in a period of denial that a problem exists.  This can be a psychological \ndenial, where those responsible refuse to acknowledge the risk even to themselves or \na more calculated denial, where the problem is denied to the outside world in an \nattempt to preserve markets, esteem or resources.  However, for both crises and \ndisasters there needs to be a \u201dtriggering event\u201d that marks the beginning of this \nprodromal stage.   \n \nFor FMD the triggering event was the first suspected, and then subsequently \nconfirmed case of the disease (the process of confirmation can take between 24 and \n48 hours), yet although the implications of one case of FMD are serious, reports of the \ndisease did not appear in the media until the number had increased significantly and \n 19 \nsome days had passed.  Thus, unlike for a catastrophic event like a flood, earthquake, \nexplosion, or acts of terrorism, the potential for denial of the existence of a problem \nwas greater, as the full extent of the problem was not discovered, and indeed had not \nyet occurred.  \n \nThe advantage of this extended Prodromal phase was the increased time available to \ndevelop a strategy to limit the spread and impact of the disease.  Here the distinction \nbetween the aims of the farming community and the tourism industry is revealed.  The \ninitial reports of the disease focused on the implications for farmers, how this would \nthreaten the price of UK meat products and the likely reaction of destination markets.  \nAs is typical of any national event there was a large amount of disagreement as to \nwhat the \u201ccorrect\u201d course of action should be.  Within the farming community there \nwas also disagreement as to whether vaccination or the policy of culling would be the \nmost beneficial.  However, the National Farmers Union (NFU) opposed the \nvaccination of healthy livestock as any such action would destroy the market value of \nthe animals, although it would prevent the spread of the disease.  Given the limited \nchoices, the NFU instead favoured burning infected cattle and limiting the movement \nof animals and people throughout rural areas. \n \nFor the tourism industry, none of its infrastructure had been threatened or damaged, \nFMD is generally not contagious to humans and the disease causes no impact on the \nvisual landscape.  Yet the policy of slaughtering and then burning infected and \nsuspected animals damaged the essential intangible quality that is the appeal and \nimage of a destination.  Thus, the disaster for the tourism industry was not the disease \nitself, but the actions taken to eradicate the farming crisis and the media images \n 20 \nassociated with these actions. There was also a perception, particularly from the North \nAmerican market, according to ETC and BTA briefing reports, that the whole of the \nUK was effectively closed due to this disease and that it was contagious to humans.  \n \nThis is perhaps a good example of the \u2018ripple effect\u2019 (Heath, 1998) which can \nexacerbate the magnitude of crises through ineffective crisis management. Managing \nthe public perception during a crisis situation is critical. As Heath (1998:26) notes \n\u201ccrisis management is as much about dealing with human perceptions about the crisis \nand the management of a crisis as it is about physically resolving the crisis situation.\u201d \nHowever, difficulties arise in managing the media as it is unlikely that there will be a \ntime delay between the start of any crisis and media coverage (Ashcroft, 1997).  Both \nBurnett (1998) and Marra (1998) note that effective crisis communication strategies \nare required as part of a strategic approach to dealing with crisis situations. Marra \n(1998:461) notes that poor communication strategies can often make the crisis worse \nas a deluge of questions is often asked from a wide range of stakeholders including \nreporters, employees, stockholders, government officials and public residents. \n \nFaulkner (2001: 142) argues, \u201cthe effectiveness with which the tourism industry in a \ndisaster area handles a crisis, and the degree to which it is prepared for it, has a \nbearing on how quickly services are restored to normal\u201d.  The tourism industry, like \nall other industries was not prepared for FMD, yet the ability of the industry to be \nprepared in a way that can protect its industry is determined by the relative power of \nthe tourism industry compared to other industries, such as the farming industry.  The \nNFU is a strong and well-organised lobbying body, while the fragmented nature of the \n 21 \ntourism industry found difficulty in speaking with one voice that could be heard \n(Cotton, 2001).   \n \nA 26% growth in tourism revenue occurred over the year to 2001 with tourism \ncontributing 7% of the workforce in rural areas, compared with a 21% decline in \nagricultural revenue contributing only 1.5% of the workforce (ETC, 2001b). Tourism \ncan be seen to be one of the key drivers of the British economy and supports around \n1.7 million jobs, with 1 in 5 of all new jobs created in the tourist industry (Star UK \nStatistics, 2001).  Yet FMD was a farming disease that threatens the very resources of \nthe tourism industry.  The long prodromal stage of the disaster and the lack of \nprevious planning ensured that this debate was held during the disaster and served to \ncreate tensions between elements of all areas of the UK. \n \nTypical of the division is the position statement released by the British Tourist \nAuthority (BTA) amidst the disaster, stating, \u201ctourism has a responsibility to support \nfarmers and help eradicate foot and mouth disease, but its primary concern is to \nsafeguard the long term interests of the tourism industry, especially the small and \nmedium sized businesses who are most affected by the outbreak and are characteristic \nof rural tourism\u201d (BTA, 2001).  While the prodromal stage of FMD was longer than \nfor other disasters and allowed more time for considering responses, there is little \ndoubt that organisations will be afforded sufficient time to think widely and to take \nany steps other than those that affect their primary responsibilities.  However, the \nprimary responsibilities of the NFU are to farmers and in the absence of a pre-\ndetermined disaster management plan, the NFU were able to influence government \npolicy in a way that favoured farmers, to the detriment of the tourism industry.  Thus, \n 22 \nthe policy of slaughter, incineration and denied access continued while the policy of \nvaccination was continually proposed and subsequently rejected.   \n \nThus, one can question in a disaster like FMD, where different sections of society are \naffected differently, then whose disaster is it, and who should the response measures \nbe aimed at aiding? Holder (1992) cites contention among the public and private \nsector in their respective roles in the tourism industry and argues that the partnership \ncan be typified allegorically by provision of the locomotive by the private sector, \nwhile the public sector should be held responsible for laying the rails on which the \ntrain proceeds.  Holder continues that if the track is correctly laid and the points well \nmanaged then the train will proceed at speed and in safety, yet he concludes that \n\u201cunfortunately there are cases where governments have been neglecting the care of \nthe rails, while showing an unnatural fascination for occupying the driver\u2019s seat of the \ntrain\u201d (pp160).  However, to continue the analogy, the FMD express often appeared to \nbe without a driver and when any direction was provided it was for the benefit of a \nsmall number of passengers only.  \n \nThe Cheltenham Festival typifies the conflict between farming and tourism during \nthis stage of the disease.  The rural location of the Festival meant that its origins lay in \nthe development of the countryside through farming, and despite changes to the \nFestival, had been regarded as a manifestation of the lives of those from the \ncountryside.  The decision by the managing director at Cheltenham to continue with \nthe Festival against farming advice was seen as a sign of disloyalty, preferring to ally \nthe Festival instead with the tourism and leisure industries.  Faulkner (2001:139) \nencapsulates this division, \u201cCommunity responses to disasters, both during the \n 23 \nemergency and afterwards in the recovery period, involve many different \norganisations.  In this situation, it is not uncommon for competition and rivalry among \nthese organisations to become a major impediment to both co-ordination and the \nability of organisations to respond effectively\u201d.  The need for a united approach to the \nresolution of a disaster is almost an axiom, yet the length of the prodromal period of \nthe FMD disaster served instead to widen and create divisions rather than the pressure \nof limited time creating the opportunity to work together and overcome institutional \nor sectoral barriers.   \n \nEmergency \nFaulkner & Vikulov (2001) demonstrate the effect on the Australian town of \nKatherine once the flood struck on the night of the 25th January 1998.  The emergency \nstage of the disaster lasted until the rain stopped and river levels began to reduce, \nwhich occurred within 24 hours.    However, for FMD, the long prodromal period \nmerged with an emergency period that could be measured in months and where the \neffects were not ubiquitous when the disease did strike.  One implication of the \ndifferent timeframe is the role of the media throughout the disease.  Rather than \nreporting on a single catastrophic event, and then turning to the clean-up operation \nand implications, the media was able to play an investigative role as the size of the \nproblem gradually became revealed and the response from other countries was also \ndemonstrated.  Harr (1994 cited in Faulkner, 2001) explains that 20% of emergency \nstaff\u2019s time can be spent in supplying the message and controlling and limiting the \ndamage done by media reporting of the event.  For FMD, the story topped news \nprogrammes and newspapers for months, yet in addition to time spent providing the \nmedia with information, the media undoubtedly influenced the way the disaster was \n 24 \nmanaged, as every step could be scrutinised and presented to the public before \ndecisions were taken.   \n \nA further consequence of the drawn out emergency stage of FMD was the \nencroaching deadline for the government to announce a general election.  The \ngovernment held a strong lead over political rivals in the polls and had made little \nsecret of its desire to face a spring election.  However, the images of burning cows \nsaturating news coverage meant an early election was impossible unless the disease \ncould be eradicated without risking the rural vote that was heavily influenced by the \nfarmers.  Yet, the crisis\/disaster conflict reflects the multi-sectoral nature of industry \nin rural areas, and there was disagreement over how the emergency stage should be \nhandled. In addition, some rural regions remained unaffected throughout and so \nvaried in their beliefs as to what should be done to contain the disease.  In addition, \nthere remained a suspicion throughout FMD that, in an increasingly urbanised Britain, \nthis was a rural problem, following on from Bovine Spongiform Ecephalopathy \n(BSE)1, debates over fox-hunting and the right to roam legislation.  Such sentiments \nexpressed via the media further demonstrated the split FMD was causing as to how to \nmanage a current and continuing emergency.   \n \nIntermediate \nThe intermediate phase is the point where the short-term needs of people have been \naddressed and the main focus of activity is to restore services and the community to \nnormal.  However, \u201cnormal\u201d may not be defined as the pre-disaster position, as this \nmay be neither possible, nor desirable.  There were no tourism resources damaged by \n                                                     \n1\n BSE is more commonly known as \u201cmad cow disease\u201d and is linked with the fatal form of the \nhuman disease Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)  \n 25 \nFMD to be repaired and the blackened image of the UK could not be repaired until the \ndisease had been defeated, despite many areas of the UK having never been affected \nby the disease.  Thus, the nature of the disaster meant that there was no \u201cturning \npoint\u201d when a town was re-opened, or a building restored or re-built, instead areas of \nthe country gradually tried to persuade visitors that it was safe to visit, while other \nareas of the UK continued to suffer with new outbreaks of the disease.  Such a \nscenario led to calls from some sectors of the tourism industry to proceed with \nadvertising campaigns encouraging visitors to the countryside, while for others, such \nconfidence-building campaigns were mis-placed until the problem had universally \nbeen removed.   \n \nThe ETC was given \u00a33.8m to promote tourism to a domestic audience in April 2001, \nwhich was spent on specific market campaigns, coupled with developing websites to \ninform potential visitors of where was safe to visit.  The ETC calculated that this \nfinancial aid generated 766,000 additional visits and produced a return on investment \nof \u00a327 for each \u00a31 spent (ETC, 2001a).  In May, a further \u00a312m was given to the BTA \nfor international marketing, while no further finance was available for the ETC and \nthe domestic market (ETC, 2001a). Some industry representatives questioned the \nspeed of the marketing finance and suggested that it was far too little too late (Cotton, \n2001).  \n \nFor the Festival, the opportunity to re-stage the event at a later date in the year had \ndisappeared, and there was little intermediate action that could be taken to repair the \ndamage of the disease.  Indeed, the main intermediate steps were providing refunds to \n 26 \ncustomers who had booked tickets in advance and trying to re-claim deposits lodged \nwith suppliers for the cancelled Festival.   \n \nLong-term (Recovery) \nThis phase is a continuation of the intermediate phase and saw Cheltenham move to \nrepair bridges with main customer groups, suppliers and other stakeholders after the \ncancellation of the Festival.  Around 5000 customers from Ireland attend the Festival \neach year, as well as a large number who live in England, giving the Festival its \nfamed Irish feel.  However, Managing Director Edward Gillespie said \u201c\u2026the Irish \nwere pretty upset with us in February and March when we originally said we were \ngoing ahead with the Festival and the Irish were not able to come, they got very upset \nwith us.  It was like us going ahead with a party, but our chief guest couldn\u2019t come.  \nThey got very upset with us\u201d.  The number of cancellations has led one of the main \nairlines serving the route from Ireland to institute a policy requiring full-payment 10 \nweeks in advance of travel, while many of the hotels in Cheltenham town had refused \nto return deposits, creating much ill-feeling.  This coupled with a general rise in the \nstature of hunt racing in Ireland and a strengthening of the British pound left the \nvaulted position of the Festival in a vulnerable position to a challenge from a rival \nIrish racecourse.  The long term recovery of the festival is contingent upon relations \nwith the principal customer group being repaired and the Irish being willing to travel \nback to Cheltenham.   \n \nResolution \nThe final phase of a disaster is the return to routine, or movement to an improved \nposition based on reflection.  Klein (2000) uses the introduction of the first company \n 27 \nsafety laws as a result of a fire that killed workers in the Triangle Shirtwaist company \nin New York in 1911 to illustrate the benefit that can accrue from disaster.  Similar to \ncrisis management approaches discussed previously, Faulkner (2001), referring to \neducational theory, describes this as the potential from the events for single loop, or \ndouble loop learning.  Kolb\u2019s (1984) framework identified how the process of an \nexperience leads to reflection that produces a proposed solution, which is ultimately \ntested and so leads to a new experience and a new round of solutions (illustrated in \nfigure 6).  Double loop learning requires a paradigmatic shift as a result of the \nexperience and so emergent knowledge is produced and ultimately new understanding \nis derived (figure 7).  The distinction between a crisis and a disaster means that those \nwho precipitate a crisis are better placed to reflect on mistakes that caused the \nproblems and institute a paradigmatic shift in thinking.  Conversely, and as evidenced \nby history, those who suffer the effects of a disaster react to events and are contained \nto single loop actions, if not single loop thinking, unless a larger body can enforce the \nnecessary changes to prevent the events repeating themselves.   \n \nFigure 6: Single Loop Learning  \n \nSource: Kolb (1984) \n \nExperience\nGeneralise\nReflect\nTest\n \n 28 \n \nFigure 7 Double Loop Learning. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Kolb (1984) \n \nTo this end, the larger body forcing change has been the national government and the \nprincipal change has been the creation of a new government ministry, the Department \nfor the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) from the ashes of the old \nMinistry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  This move illustrates two central \nthemes to this paper well.  Firstly, it is indicative of the relative power of the farming \nindustry and the tourism industry that the department for tourism does not sit within \nthis newly formed ministry, but instead remains within the Department for Culture, \nMedia and Sport (DCMS).  While secondly, the move demonstrates a lack of \nunderstanding by the government about the tourism industry.  The much heralded \nclaim of the Labour government has been to produce \u201cjoined-up government\u201d, yet the \nexclusion of the representatives of the tourism industry from the new ministry for \nrural affairs can do little to promote tourism\u2019s influence over future disaster \npreparations, or more positively, over the continued changes taking place to the \neconomic and social fabric of rural areas, of which tourism is a major contributor.   \nExperience\nGeneralise\nReflect\nTest\nParadigm shift\nEmergent KnowingNew Understanding\n \n 29 \n \nThe government also introduced plans for a crisis management unit within the \nnational government staffed by 100 civil servants which will report to the prime \nminister through the cabinet secretary.  The unit has been tasked with \u2018scanning the \nhorizon\u2019 to provide an early warning system of looming disasters.  Once a crisis \ndevelops, the unit will ensure that government departments co-ordinate their \nresponses more effectively both within government and in communicating to the \noutside world.  However, the appointment of a press officer to run the unit suggests \nthat the government is perhaps more concerned with managing crisis communication \nto the general public. \n \nYet, as a result of FMD, the tourism industry has benefited from a heightened profile \nand a wider recognition of its contribution to the economy as a whole and specifically \nto the rural economy.  To try to capitalise on this elevation, the tourism industry has \nformed a Tourism Alliance \u201cto enable the tourism industry to speak with a united, \ncohesive voice\u201d (Travelmole, 2001a), headed by the Director-General of the \nConfederation of British Industry (CBI).  Such a chair can do much to ensure tourism \ndoes not become excluded, or sidelined from the planning for, or management of \nfuture disasters.  However, if power does not shift to the tourism industry, then any \npreparations become a cosmetic exercise and the notion of disaster planning and \nmanagement in tourism becomes devalued.  \n \nFor Cheltenham, FMD has meant a valuable revision of its relation with its customers \nand stakeholders.  The disaster has forced a recognition that there had been some \ncomplacency with regard to the value of customers from Ireland and a determination \n 30 \nnot to take them for granted in the future.  Similarly, the 6500 members of \nCheltenham were not entitled to a refund on their membership because of the \ncancellation of one particular racing meet during the year, even though the Festival \nrepresents the main attraction of membership.  This caused great upset amongst some \nmembers and the managing director concedes the problems arose in describing a \npolicy that was not well stated originally and  \u201c\u2026if you haven\u2019t had a reverse in 55 \nyears, you get out of the habit of how to handle it\u201d.  However, as a result of the \ndisaster \u201c\u2026we will better state it (the policy) so that people know at the point of \nengagement what the deal is\u2026it is a very good example of how we have taken them \nfor granted and therefore we haven\u2019t managed it well and so we now have a whole \nnew re-design of how we are going to engage with our members\u201d (Gillespie, 2001).   \n \nSimilarly, the cancellation of the Festival meant local hoteliers, restaurateurs and \nothers dependent on the 3 day meet were forced to re-evaluate their relationship with \nthe racecourse.  There is evidence that suppliers have profited from FMD by being \nrefunded after the decision to cancel, and then not passing this refund on to those who \nwould supply the suppliers.  Such practices have led to a revision of relationships and \na tightening of the procedures for engagement with suppliers.   \n \n \nConclusion: A Critique of the Disaster Framework \nFMD was a very different type of disaster from the Katherine floods, to which \nFaulkner & Vikulov (2001) apply the Faulkner (2001) disaster management \nframework.  FMD was a disaster with broad temporal and spatial boundaries, while \nthe Katherine floods were very concentrated in both time and space.  Conversely, the \ntourism industry of Katherine, despite high and low seasons, is continuous and \n 31 \noccupies an area sufficient to accommodate 11,000 residents whereas the Cheltenham \nFestival occurs over three days in March and is contained within an area the size of a \nracecourse.  Further, FMD was a complex disaster as the prodromal, emergency and \nrecovery stages were all happening simultaneously for large periods of time, not just \nfor different locations, but for different industrial sectors of the same location, and in \nsome cases within the same organisation.  As a result, the optimistic aim of reflection \nproducing healing never materialised, instead deep divisions within the countryside \nhave emerged, and worsened relations between urban and rural areas.  Thus, while \nFaulkner\u2019s (2001) model does serve to identify stages to the disaster, they are not as \nclearly discernable as for the Katherine floods.  This may be due to the evolving \nnature of the disaster or the role of the media, but may also be as a result of its \napplication to an organisation rather than a discrete destination. \n \nFaulkner (2001:136) suggests that \u201cthe increased volume of global tourism activity \nhas combined with the attractiveness of high-risk exotic destinations to expose \ntourists to greater levels of risk\u201d.  Yet, the Cheltenham Festival occupies just three \ndays in the annual sporting calendar and takes place in a delightful, yet far from \nexotic, rural area to the west of England.  The rarity of such an event being impacted \nupon by a disaster meant that pre-disaster planning was almost non-existent and later \nfound to be unhelpful.  Subsequent stages of the disaster were influenced largely by \nthe power position of the tourism industry vis-a-vis the  farming industry and meant \nthat the prodromal, emergency and recovery stages were concerned with responding \nto the disaster that became the farming industry\u2019s suggestions of how to react to the \nFMD crisis, which in turn led to a tourism disaster.  Little proactive strategies \n 32 \nplanning were made in relation to a tourism disaster in the UK and managers had to \ndeal with the crisis in the best way they could. \n \nThus, the framework can be seen as an analytical tool of what happened, but would \nhave limited value in enabling event managers to steer a pre-determined course \nthrough such an unlikely, yet catastrophic event.  However, the case of FMD has \nillustrated how a crisis from one industry (farming) can impact upon another \n(tourism), and how this can be exacerbated through the \u2018ripple effect\u2019 and a lack of \ncrisis management planning and preparation.  The nature of the tourism industry \ndictates that the industry should be better prepared for dealing with crises, disasters \nand fluctuations of demand. Yet in the case of the UK and FMD this preparation was \nnot evident, and so the disaster was not dealt with as effectively or efficiently as it \nshould have been. It is hoped that this paper has contributed in some way to providing \nlessons for tourism destination managers and organisations through the case of the \nFMD in the UK.  \n \nPostscript \nA survey of domestic tourism in the UK showed that as a result of FMD spending for \nthe first 6 months of 2001 had declined by 6%, when compared with the first 6 \nmonths of 2000.  This had produced losses of \u00a31.4billion from January to June 2001 \n(Travelmole, 2002), yet during this period larger towns and cities saw an increased \nlevel of businesses from domestic tourism as they were perceived to be safer places to \nvisit.  Domestic tourism in the UK contributes \u00a34 out of every \u00a35 earned through \ntourism, equalling \u00a32billion more revenue earned through five times as many trips as \nmade by overseas visitors.  However, international visitors were also keen to remain \n 33 \nin urban areas, denying the countryside its share of the \u00a312.5billion international \nvisitors spend in the UK (BTA, 2001). \n \nThe events of September 11th 2001 in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania had a \nsevere impact on tourism in the UK.  Figures for air traffic from the North Atlantic \nshow a 31.3% decline for October and 26% decline for November (Travelmole, \n2001a), the same large cities and towns that had benefited from FMD when perceived \nas safer places to visit, now faced a significant decline in visitors as they were seen as \npotential targets from terrorism.  The increased risk of overseas travel resulted in \nevidence of people switching to holidays in the UK rather than travel overseas.  \nResearch conducted by the ETC in October 2001 revealed 15% of respondents had \ncancelled their trip, either domestic or international, 25% had postponed, 48% decided \nnot to make any plans until the situation was more clear, yet 19% of those contacted \nhad switched to holidaying in the UK rather than abroad (Travelmole, 2001b).  The \nmain beneficiaries of this decision were rural destinations, which were once again \nperceived to be safe areas to holiday.   \nWithin the course of 8 months the rural tourism industry had suffered huge losses \nfrom FMD and then benefited from growth as domestic tourism increased and \ndiverted to the countryside.  Such a course of events illustrates the vulnerability of the \ntourism industry to disasters, but demonstrates the potential for positive change to \nemerge.  However, the extent of negative or positive impact is largely beyond the \ncontrol of the tourism industry.  Both FMD and the terrorism on September 11th 2001 \ncould not have been influenced by the tourism industry, only responded to, while both \nevents were entirely unpredictable.  Despite the valuable attempts of Faulkner (2001) \nto introduce the topic of disaster management to tourism, the case of FMD and \n 34 \nSeptember 11th 2001 perhaps accounts for the lack of preparedness amongst the \nindustry and literature covering adequate responses to disasters.   \n \n 35 \nReferences \nAshcroft, R (1997) Crisis management: Public relations.
