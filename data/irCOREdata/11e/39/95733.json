Global standards and models are developed with the aim of \nincreasing international comparability, enhancing cross-national co-operation, and \nfacilitating co-ordination (see e.g. Braithwaite & Drahos, 2000; Brunsson & Jacobsson, \n2000; Held & McGrew, 2002; Tamm Hallstr\u00f6m, 2004). They are deployed with the \naspiration of making things work together, of traversing space and overcoming \nheterogeneous metrics (Bowker & Star, 2000; Drori, Meyer & Hwang, 2006; Drori, \nMeyer, Ramirez & Schofer, 2003; Meyer, 2002).1 In accounting and auditing, \ninternational standards have been advocated as a way of enhancing the international \ncomparability and credibility of financial reporting and audit work, so as to stimulate \nthe flow of cross-national investment, expand the scope for market-oriented \ndevelopment, and integrate local enterprises into global financial markets (see e.g. \nBotzem & Quack, 2006; IDW, 1978; Roussey, 1992, 1999).2 Yet, despite this \nburgeoning interest in international standardisation projects, apart from a few isolated \nstudies (see e.g. Barrett, Cooper & Jamal, 2005) there has been little research that \nexamines how these standardisation projects are articulated in local settings and \ninteractions, and how these local interactions enable the connecting of worlds through \nthe often intricate and laborious translation of international standards (Callon, 1980; \nLatour, 1987, 1999). \nThe literature on transnational governance has paid much attention to the rise and \nspread of global rules at the international level, but not to their actual involvement in the \nre-organising and re-defining of local practices. Studies of global accounting and audit \nregulation have contributed to our understanding of the complex structure of \n                                                 \n1\n Etymologically, the word \u201cstandard\u201d was derived from the Latin word \u201cextendere\u201d \u2013 to stretch out, to \nextend, extension (Williams, 1983, pp. 296-299). The word referred to dreams of international expansion \nand cross-national comparability. According to Williams (1983, p. 296), in modern language the word \n\u201cstandard\u201d is in addition often used to mark a source of authority or a level of achievement. \n2\n The first international auditing standard was issued by the International Federation of Accountants \n(IFAC) in 1979, but it is only since the 1990s these standards have gained considerable attention \n(Roussey, 1996, 1999). In the 1990s, organisations such as the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and \nlarge multinational audit firms began to promote ISAs against the backdrop of wider debates about global \neconomic governance. Events, such as the Mexican (1994-95) and South-East Asian (1998) financial \ncrises and the collapse of the Barings bank, had led to serious doubts about the regulatory capacities of \nstate-bound command-and-control regimes. International standards, including those for auditing, came to \nbe put forward as a new source and technique of regulation that would help overcome the boundaries of \nstate control and facilitate economic co-ordination and stabilisation at an international level. \n  2 \ntransnational accounting governance arrangements (Botzem & Quack, 2006; Bromwich \n& Hopwood, 1983; Caramanis, 2002; Fogarty, 1992, 1998; Nobes & Parker, 2004), the \nmechanisms and dreams underlying the diffusion of international accounting standards \nand audit models (Jang, 2006; Power, 2002; Tamm Hallstr\u00f6m, 2004), and the strategies \nof the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) and IAASB (International \nAudit and Assurance Standards Board) to enhance their authority (Loft, Humphrey & \nTurley, 2006; Tamm Hallstr\u00f6m, 2004). But in all of these studies, the primary focus has \nbeen on the standard-setting organisations themselves. Much work has focused on the \ndiffusion of global regulation at the macro-level, and on the groups that develop \nworldwide models and standards. Detailed case studies examining the links and \ninteractions between processes of international rule-setting and local practices are rare. \nThis paper aims to help remedy this gap in the literature through a detailed examination \nof the use and circulation of International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) within a large \npost-Soviet audit firm, as it faces up to the challenges of international harmonisation. \nThe analysis shows that international accounting and audit standardisation is not just a \ntop-down process, as much of the existing literature seems to suggest (see e.g. Drori, \nMeyer & Hwang, 2006; Held & McGrew, 2002; Tamm Hallstr\u00f6m, 2004). It is equally \ndriven by the day-to-day activities of local, peripheral actors, who bring with them \ndreams and desires of belonging to a better, more prosperous, globally integrated world \n(Burawoy et al., 2000; Sahlin-Andersson & Engwall, 2002b). Transnational standard-\nsetting institutions play an important role in the globalisation and standardisation of \nsocial and economic life. But we need to draw attention also to the networks of actors, \ninstruments and activities that support and shape standardising agendas in local settings. \nTo paraphrase Sahlin-Andersson and Engwall (2002a, pp. 6-7), we need to combine \nbroad contextual and historical investigations with detailed case studies to understand \nhow and why the expansion of global models and standards occurs. \nUtilising the works of Latour (1986; 1987) and other proponents of actor-network \ntheory, together with related constructivist approaches to the study of science and \ntechnology (Bowker & Star, 2000; Callon, 1980, 1986; Czarniawska & Sev\u00f3n, 1996, \n2005; Hacking, 1983, 1999; Law & Hassard, 1999; Star & Griesemer, 1989), this paper \npays close attention to the multiple linkages and webs of interaction through which \nattempts are made to translate international auditing standards into possibilities for \nregulatory and professional action. To address \u201cconnecting worlds\u201d, the theme of this \n  3 \narticle, means to open up for investigation the multiplicity of instruments, ideas, actors \nand activities involved in making ISAs spread and link up with different contexts and \nprocesses. The notion of \u201cconnecting worlds\u201d refers to the complex of linkages formed \nbetween ISAs and Soviet and post-Soviet worlds, local and global worlds, East and \nWest, formal and informal practices, together with the desires and experiences of those \nenacting ideas and techniques of audit standardisation. It directs our attention to the \nvarious ways in which international standardisation attempts are projected and linked to \nlocal contexts of auditing practice, and how those contexts in turn are connected to other \n\u201cworlds\u201d.3 ISAs often come to inhabit multiple, contradictory contexts, which can \npromote the connecting of some worlds, but also lead to the disconnecting of others. \nThe worlds within which ISAs become embedded are composed of heterogeneous \nelements and diverse historical trajectories. \u201cConnecting worlds\u201d aims to make space \nnot only for the wider political programmes and rationales (see e.g. Miller & Rose, \n1990) that articulate and popularise international auditing standards, but also for the \njuxtapositions and tensions (see e.g. Czarniawska & Sev\u00f3n, 1996, 2005; Latour, 1987, \n1999; Star & Griesemer, 1989) within which the standards become entangled \nthroughout their translation into localised audit practice. \nIn particular, the concepts of translation and networking (e.g. Callon, 1980, 1986; Chua, \n1995; Czarniawska & Sev\u00f3n, 1996; Gendron, Cooper & Townley, 2007; Latour, 1987, \n1999; Miller, 1991; Robson, 1991; Sahlin-Andersson & Engwall, 2002b; Star & \nGriesemer, 1989) are useful concepts from which we can start to develop a heuristic \nfacilitating empirically rich and historically sensitive descriptions of the intersecting \ndiscourses, practices and techniques that shape and characterise processes of \ninternational audit standardisation. As will be shown in more detail later, the notion of \ntranslation helps emphasise the constructed nature of the indispensability of \ninternational standards, and points to the various persuasive strategies, power plays and \nrelations underlying their diffusion (e.g. Callon, 1986 and Latour, 1987; but see also \nChua, 1995; Miller, 1991; Robson, 1991). The notions of networks and networking help \nus draw attention to the fact that ISAs do not work all by themselves, and do not \n                                                 \n3\n In this respect, the notion of \u201cconnecting worlds\u201d is very similar to Miller and O\u2019Leary\u2019s (2007) notion \nof \u201cmediating instruments\u201d, although Miller and O\u2019Leary investigate a completely different context. \nMiller and O\u2019Leary (2007) use the notion of \u201cmediating instruments\u201d to study the roles of \u201cMoore\u2019s Law\u201d \nand \u201ctechnology roadmaps\u201d in the microprocessor industry. They examine the ways in which these \ninstruments \u201care used to envision a future, and how they link a multitude of actors and domains in such a \nway that the making of future markets for microprocessors and related devices can continue\u201d (Miller & \nO'Leary, 2007, p. 2). \n  4 \nengender processes of organisational change and global harmonisation without support \n(e.g. Callon, Law & Rip, 1986; Czarniawska & Sev\u00f3n, 1996; Gendron, Cooper & \nTownley, 2007; Latour, 1986; Sahlin-Andersson & Engwall, 2002b). In order to turn \nthe ISAs into a connecting device, one needs powerful alliances providing the standards \nand their users not only with technical resources, but also political influence, identity \nand legitimacy. The adoption of ISAs requires a series of technical adjustments. But in \nthe case of Russia, it also demands of auditors, regulators and managers that they \nbecome comfortable with an identity which, to a large extent, is both offered and \ndefined by the West. By examining how ISAs become inscribed in different worlds of \naudit action, representation and regulation, we gain insight into the complex processes, \nactivities and controversies underlying attempts to establish ISAs as a connecting device \nlinking up local audit worlds with imagined global forms of audit activity. \nThe Case of Moskva-Audit \nThe audit firm studied in this paper was established during the Perestroika period. \nThroughout the paper, the firm will be referred to as \u201cMoskva-Audit\u201d. At the time when \nthis field study was carried out, Moskva-Audit was one of Russia\u2019s leading audit and \nconsulting firms. The firm had more than 700 employees, of which more than 120 \npossessed Russian professional auditing and accounting qualifications. In 2001, the \nfirm\u2019s annual revenues amounted to more than 20 Million US-Dollars, of which around \n50% was raised by auditing and assurance services (see Russian business journal \nProfil\u2019, 11.03.2002, pp. 78-85). In the Russian audit and consulting firm ratings \nconducted by the internationally acknowledged Russian rating agency \"Ekspert-RA\" (an \norganisation affiliated to the Russian business journal Ekspert), Moskva-Audit was \nconsistently ranked amongst the first ten leading Russian audit and consulting firms (in \nterms of revenue, number of employees and market share) between 1995 and 2005.4 \nAccess to the firm was obtained through a two-month long internship which was carried \nout in Moscow during March and April 2002. During the period spent with the firm, the \nauthor conducted participant observations (Spradley, 1980) in the international audit \ndepartment of the firm and observed the preparation and use of audit programmes, \n                                                 \n4\n Results of the rankings and more detailed information about the largest 100 Russian audit and \nconsulting firms are regularly published in the Russian business journal \u201cEkspert\u201d. See e.g. the issues of \nEkspert Nr. 35, 16.09.1996; Nr. 14, 14.04.1997; Nr. 42, 09.11.1998; Nr. 11, 22.03.1999; Nr. 10, \n13.03.2000; Nr. 12, 26.03.2001; Nr. 12, 25.03.2002; Nr. 14, 14.04.2003; Nr. 13, 05.04.2004; Nr. 12, \n28.03.2005; Nr. 12, 27.03.2006. For reasons of confidentiality, more details cannot be disclosed. \n  5 \nworking papers and audit files. Access was also obtained to the audit manuals, internal \nstandards and quality control procedures of the firm. In addition to the participant \nobservations, semi-structured interviews (Wengraf, 2001) were carried out with: the \nDeputy Director of the firm, the heads of internal audit quality control, business \ndevelopment, audit methodology, the international standards department, two audit \nmanagers, two senior auditors and one audit trainee. All but one of these interviews \nwere tape-recorded and transcribed. The length of the interviews varied between one \nand three hours. The formal interviews were complemented with several informal talks \nconducted during coffee breaks, lunches and dinners. Outside the firm, further \ninterviews were carried out with audit professionals working for other indigenous or \ninternational audit firms, regulators, academics, Western consultants and representatives \nof professional associations. The total number of formal, fully transcribed interviews \namounted to forty-eight. Most interviews were conducted in Russian and transcribed in \nCyrillic. For the purposes of this article, quotes taken from Russian language interviews \nhave been translated into English by the author. Where the translation of a specific term \nwas ambiguous, the original Russian term has been added in brackets next to the \nEnglish translation. \nTogether, the methods of participant observation, in-depth interviewing and document \nanalysis helped add depth and rigour to this study. Notes taken during periods of \nparticipant observation made it possible to compare and contrast responses of \ninterviewees.5 It was also possible to locate the interviews within the work contexts of \nthe participants, and to interrelate the different perspectives opened up by each method. \nFor the data analysis, text passages derived from interviews, field notes and other \ndocuments were grouped and coded in relation to particular themes, problems and \nquestions. The material was, inter alia, ordered and analysed in relation to the different \ndreams and desires that had become attached to the standards, logics and politics of \nprofessional representation, competing notions of rule following, and relations between \nauditing, standards and documentary practices in order to gain a deeper understanding \nof the complex interrelations and intersections between past socialist inspection \npractices and new imagined Western audit practices. \nThe decision to focus on the articulation and circulation of international auditing \nstandards within a post-Soviet audit firm is because it is particularly in peripheral \n                                                 \n5\n Minutes of the observations were typed into a seventy-page long journal. \n  6 \nmarket-oriented economies that international standards and world organisational models \nhave gained influence and pose particular challenges (e.g. Chamisa, 2000; Lin & Chan, \n2000; Meyer, Boli, Thomas & Ramirez, 1997; Sucher, Moizer & Zelenka, 1998). Most \ninternational models and standards tend to spread from the centre to the peripheries of \ncapitalist development (Braithwaite & Drahos, 2000; Cooper, Greenwood, Hinings & \nBrown, 1998; Meyer, Boli, Thomas & Ramirez, 1997). But, it is argued here, this is not \na simple matter of uni-directional diffusion. Instead, it is suggested that it is at the \nperipheries of capitalism that new spaces for globalisation are delineated, and new \nelements and actors are defined and integrated. Here, international standards and models \nare taken particularly seriously. They are fundamental to the re-defining of \norganisational identities and regulatory politics. They are linked to dreams of modern \ndevelopment, and their adoption is seen as a way of linking up with, and becoming \naccepted by, Western worlds of economic and political activities. \nAt Moskva-Audit, the adoption of international auditing standards was driven by the \ndesire to belong to \u201cthe West\u201d. The standards were seen as instruments that can help \novercome local differences, develop post-Soviet audit expertise, and gain access to \ninternational audit markets. But, as the following analysis will show, the translation of \nthe standards into day-to-day audit practices is not a matter of straightforward \nimplementation. Standards, including international auditing standards, are always in \nsome sense idealised (Bowker & Star, 2000; Power, 2002). They embody goals of \npractice that are never perfectly realised. International auditing standards express neo-\nliberal dreams of control and governability, but they do not constitute an instrument that \nis perfectly suited to organising and standardising audit practice per se. \nInternational standards do not constitute a homogeneous class of rules or regulatory \nnorms (see e.g. Bowker & Star, 2000; Brunsson & Jacobsson, 2000). They vary in \nscope, detail and objectives. Standards can take a formal or informal shape. They can be \nvisible or invisible. They can be used to classify things, to specify production designs, \nor to determine outputs. They can be aimed at the regulation of processes or the \nspecification of inputs. They can express ideals or refer to already established practices. \nInternational Standards on Auditing (ISAs), which are aimed at the international \nregulation of professional conduct, are very different from well established technical \nnorms setting out paper sizes or defining measurement scales. In contrast to output or \nproduct standards and norms of calibration, international auditing standards are \n  7 \nprimarily concerned with the regulation of procedures and processes. They do not refer \nto the immediate work environment of auditors, but to the procedures and plans that \nauditors and audit firms should develop when performing audit work. To adopt a phrase \nfrom Brunsson and Jacobsson (2000, pp. 4-5), auditing standards, like other process \nstandards, do not refer to quality actually achieved, but to the types of administrative \nprocesses that are supposed to lead to high quality. Or, to paraphrase Power (2002, p. \n195), they are of little substantive content. International auditing standards follow \nrelatively closely the general structure of audit processes, as for example outlined in \nmany Western textbooks (see e.g. Gray & Manson, 2005). For example, the standards \ndeal with such issues as audit planning, the gathering and assessment of audit evidence, \ninternal control procedures and the formulation of audit reports. But neither audit \nobjectives nor the actual output of audit processes is made concrete. \nIn most Western countries, ISAs typically codify existing audit practices, instead of \ntransforming or reforming them. For example, in countries like the UK or the US, \nauditing standards constitute an outcome, rather than a starting point, of processes of \naudit development and professionalisation (Campbell, 1985). In Russia, the situation is \nquite different. Here, the international auditing standards are introduced into an \nenvironment where market-oriented auditing is only in its initial phase of development. \nIn such an environment, the same ISAs that in the West function primarily as a \nmechanism of codification and symbolic representation become tools for supporting and \naccelerating processes of post-communist audit reform and economic transition. \nStandardisation projects are culturally and strategically complex (Barrett, Cooper & \nJamal, 2005; Brunsson & Jacobsson, 2000; Loya & Boli, 1999; Power, 2002). They are \naimed at the enhancement of international comparability. Yet, at the same time, they are \nalways articulated and enacted in specific places (for the case of Eastern European \ntransition see also the studies by Burawoy & Verdery, 1999; Cooper, Greenwood, \nHinings & Brown, 1998; Stark, 1998; Stark & Bruszt, 1998). Hence, to obtain a deeper \nunderstanding of how processes of international audit standardisation work, we need to \ntake a closer look at the different connections that are established between the standards, \nlocal practices, people and instruments, as well as the wider networks of actors, \nexpectations and demands involved in defining what it means to work in accordance \nwith international standards. We need to pay close attention to locally specific \n\u201cconstellations\u201d (Burchell, Clubb & Hopwood, 1985) of actors, strategies, instruments, \n  8 \nbeliefs, bodies of knowledge and activities. Studying the roles of ISAs within a post-\nSoviet audit firm helps open up for investigation the complex of political and economic \nrationales, hopes and desires that accompany the rise and spread of the standards, and \nhow these interact with the localised processes that seek to operationalise and give \nsubstance to the dream of global standards. \nTranslation, Standardisation and the Stabilisation of Networks \nThis paper suggests that working in accordance with international standards is more \nthan a matter of technical implementation. Studies of technical implementation tend to \nfocus on the tools and processes that are needed to make certain models, rules, concepts \nor standards operable. Standardisation is seen as a unidirectional process with objectives \nand outcomes that can be unequivocally defined (see e.g. David & Greenstein, 1990; \nGabel, 1987; Grindley, 1995). But, as this study will show, ISAs do not constitute \nunequivocal, ready-made tools that without further ado can be used and acted upon. \nProcesses of \u201cISA-implementation\u201d are contested and ISAs play multiple roles in \ndifferent settings. In order to capture the multiplicity of roles, concepts and practices \nthat become attached to the standards as they journey through and connect different \nworlds, the paper uses the concept of translation in place of implementation. \nInitially developed within the context of sociological studies of science and technology \nand actor-network theory (Callon, 1980, 1986; Callon, Law & Rip, 1986; Latour, 1987, \n1999), the concept of translation refers to the relational and rhetorical work involved in \nmaking the development and spread of scientific inventions, calculative practices or \nmodels of financial control, such as auditing in our case, happen. Since the early 1990s, \nthe concept came to be used in analyses of accounting (see e.g. Miller, 1991; Preston, \nCooper & Coombs, 1992; Robson, 1991, 1994). Robson (1994), for example, used the \nconcept to analyse how issues of national economic growth, the calculation of taxation \nand wage bargaining became linked to inflation accounting techniques. Miller (1991) \nused the concept to examine how programmes of macroeconomic government became \ninscribed in techniques of discounted cash flow accounting. Within organisational \nresearch, Czarniawska and Sev\u00f3n (1996; 2005) and Sahlin-Andersson and Engwall \n(2002b) have used the notion of translation in the study of processes of organisational \nchange, the global expansion of management expertise and the transformation of global \norganisational models into local organisational practices. For the purposes of our study, \nthe concept is useful in at least three respects. \n  9 \nFirst, it points to the work that is needed to make the spread of ISAs happen (see e.g. \nCallon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 1999). The notion of translation makes us aware that \ninternational auditing standards cannot be conceptualised as self-contained entities. \nThey need to be actively mobilised. They need to be made translatable. They need to be \nmade operable, and this requires a whole set of different people, technical devices and \nactivities. It includes, for example, powerful actors lobbying on behalf of the standards, \npolitical agendas stressing their importance, conferences and seminars promoting their \nusefulness. It includes also a whole host of other \u2018minor\u2019 or more local techniques and \nstrategies, such as their inscription in audit manuals, working papers and organisational \ncontrol procedures, which ensure that the standards continue to be viewed as desirable \nand indispensable. \nSecond, the notion of translation helps us ask how ISAs alter, and are altered by, the \ncontexts or arenas they pass through and connect (for this point see in particular \nCzarniawska & Sev\u00f3n, 1996; Evans, 2004; Sahlin-Andersson & Engwall, 2002a; Star & \nGriesemer, 1989). The concept of translation draws attention to the changes that the \nstandards undergo and produce. In order to take root, the standards have to be adjusted \nto the environment into which they are brought. They have to be made understandable, \napplicable and workable, resulting in a series of transformations which affect not only \nthe adopters and their practices but also the standards themselves. In this respect, the \nconcept of translation differs significantly from neo-institutionalist conceptualisations \nof diffusion. Neo-institutionalist studies draw attention to important sources and \ninstitutional pressures that trigger the spread of organisational models and standards \n(e.g. DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Strang & Meyer, 1994). But they tend to leave the \nstruggles underlying standardising processes black-boxed. Neo-institutionalist \nconceptualisations of diffusion are often described in terms derived from the physical \nsciences, such as notions of saturation, contagion or thermodynamic equilibriums (see \ne.g. Strang & Tuma, 1993), which tend not to give prominence to the various \nmovements and alterations happening around the spread of ISAs. \nThird, the concept of translation highlights the undefined and open nature of the \nstandards. It draws attention to the gaps and indeterminacies accompanying the spread \nand utilisation of international auditing standards (Czarniawska & Sev\u00f3n, 1996, 2005; \nLatour, 1999; Rottenburg, 2003). What constitutes compliance with ISAs cannot a \npriori be fully or precisely defined. Sociological studies of regulation in other areas \n  10 \nhave shown that compliance is rarely a static, a priori defined concept. The definition \nand achievement of compliance is the product of interaction, interpretation, competing \ndemands and principles, as well as the broader social and institutional context within \nwhich regulation takes place (see e.g. Hutter, 1997). Neither the objectives nor the \noutcomes of international audit standardisation projects can be viewed as wholly fixed. \nThis does not mean that the standards are open to all kinds of different interpretations at \nall times. As we will see later in the paper, interpretations of the standards can become \ntemporarily fixed and stabilised. But such interpretive stabilisations are only to a limited \nextent determined by the rules themselves. Rather, it is the specificities of the \n\u201ccommunities of practice\u201d (Wenger, 1998) within which the standards become \ncirculated that define how ISAs should be used and interpreted.6 \nIn order to understand how ISAs become translated into, and connect, different worlds, \nwe suggest that it is important to trace the complex networks of actors, instruments, \nideas and activities within which they become entangled (see e.g. Czarniawska & \nSev\u00f3n, 1996; Gendron, Cooper & Townley, 2007; Latour, 1987; Latour, 2005; Sahlin-\nAndersson & Engwall, 2002b). ISAs are translated into audit practice through being \nlinked to, and interdefined with, a range of different, historically and geographically \nspecific concerns and issues (for this point see also Barrett, Cooper & Jamal, 2005; \nBurchell, Clubb & Hopwood, 1985; Miller & O'Leary, 1994, 2007; Robson, 1991). In \nthe context of this study, the notions of network and the stabilising of networks are used \nto stress that the translation of ISAs is a relational achievement. As Callon (1998, p. 8) \nmight put it, how ISAs work depends on the \u201cmorphology of relations\u201d in which they \nare involved. What \u201cworking in accordance with ISAs\u201d means fluctuates with the \nstructure and dynamics of the relations formed around the standards between different \nactors, concepts of rule following, audit instruments, expectations and audit activities.7 \n                                                 \n6\n In this respect, ISAs differ from International Accounting Standards (IAS), which tend to be much more \ndetailed and prescriptive. Whereas International Accounting Standards set out specific requirements for \nthe calculation and representation of certain accounting entities, ISAs are much vaguer. They set out the \ngeneral structure of an audit process and require, for example, auditors to design their audit programmes \nand audit tests in accordance with identified audit risk levels (see e.g. ISA 300 \u201cPlanning an Audit of \nFinancial Statements\u201d and ISA 330 \u201cThe Auditor\u2019s Procedures in Response to Assessed Risks\u201d). But the \ntypes and mix of tests (e.g. regarding the mix of substantive tests and tests of internal control) are left \nopen to the auditor\u2019s judgement. \n7\n It should be noted that the notion of network used in this paper is distinct from organisational network \ntheory which tends to focus almost exclusively on the establishment of interpersonal and inter-\norganisational relations (see e.g. Nohria & Eccles, 1992). The networks described here are not only held \ntogether by social and organisational relations. They are also shaped by material things, technical \ninstruments as well as wider ideas, concepts and discursive rationalities (see e.g. Callon, 1998; Hacking, \n1992; Latour, 2005; Law & Hassard, 1999; Miller & O'Leary, 1994; Miller & Rose, 1990). \n  11 \nIn the case studied here, international auditing standards became involved in, and were \ncalled upon to mediate between, very different worlds of auditing and audit \nprofessionalism. These worlds were made up of different approaches to rule following, \nconcepts of standardisation and bodies of accounting and audit expertise. On the one \nhand, ISAs were seen as a vehicle to enhance international acceptance and modernise \naccounting and auditing in accordance with ideals mainly derived from Anglo-Saxon \nworlds of audit professionalism. On the other hand, the standards became mixed up with \nformer, socialist traditions of control. They became implicated in paper-based checks of \nformal accuracy, bureaucratic controls of legal compliance and applications of old \naccounting rules. The paper traces the various attempts that were undertaken at Moskva-\nAudit to build linkages and bridges between Soviet and post-Soviet worlds, old as well \nas new imagined audit worlds. It examines where the introduction of ISAs initiated \nchange, and where it produced conflict, cleavages and resistance. In so doing, the paper \nunderscores the fragile and precarious nature of international standardisation projects. \nUtilising the concept of translation makes us focus on \u201cthe messy actualities of \ngovernance\u201d (O'Malley, Weir & Shearing, 1997, p. 504). Or as Miller and Rose (1990, \np. 11) put it, it highlights how difficult it is to put into practice the will to govern, which \napplies as much to international standardisation projects as to other aspirations such as \nenhancing competitiveness, national efficiency or personal satisfaction at work. \nBut the paper uses the notion of translation not only to analyse movements from the \nabstract to the concrete, and to highlight the complex and problematic process of \nmaking standards practicable. We pay attention not only to the doings of accounting \nprofessionals, but also to the different ideas and concepts that shape their activities. \nPrevious studies have made us aware that seemingly mundane techniques of auditing \nand audit standardisation, such as sampling, substantive testing or risk and materiality \ncalculations, are deeply implicated in, and conditioned by, specific ways of thinking \nabout the nature and practice of auditing, and control more generally. Power (1992; \n1999), for example, has demonstrated that the development of audit sampling \ntechniques in the UK and USA was inextricably linked to the emergence of new \nperceptions of social control and attempts to rationalise and objectify intuitively based \npractices. For the case of public sector auditing, Radcliffe (1998) has shown that a \nreconfiguration of political rationalities in terms of management stimulated the \ndevelopment of efficiency auditing in Alberta. These studies suggest that in order to \nexplain how international auditing standards become translated into post-Soviet audit \n  12 \npractice, we should not only focus on the instruments used to make them practicable. \nWe should also examine how these instruments are shaped by the different concepts and \nideals that become attached to them. For example, we can expect that international \nauditing standards play different roles in contexts with strong emphases on individual \nexpert judgement, in contrast to contexts where audit functions are closely tied to the \nassurance of legal rule-following. It is one of the central tasks of this study to describe \nand analyse the different connections drawn between ISAs, audit instruments and \nspecific ways of thinking about the nature and practice of auditing. \nIt is further important to note that the translation of ISAs is always shaped by plays of \npower and identity politics. To understand how ISAs work, we also need to look at the \nstruggles, negotiations and dynamics of recognition involved in defining whether \nsomebody is working in accordance with ISAs or not. Work in accordance with the \nstandards needs to be authorised and validated (for a similar line of argument focussing \non the authorisation and validation of governmental audit expertise in Canada see \nGendron, Cooper & Townley, 2007). Whether or not an audit organisation (or an \nauditor) is defined as working in accordance with international standards is in large part \nexternally ascribed. In the case of Moskva-Audit, the accomplishment of compliance \nwith international auditing standards was highly dependent on the definitional powers of \nthe West, represented by the Big Four audit firms and multilateral organisations, such as \nthe World Bank and the OECD. To become seen and identified as a firm that is able to \nprovide work in accordance with ISAs, Moskva-Audit had to find allies who already \nenjoyed worldwide acceptance. It had to build up relations with globally operating audit \nnetworks to validate its work. The paper traces the firm\u2019s manifold strategies to build up \ninternational institutional recognition and discusses the implications this had for the \nroles and relevance of the international auditing standards. \nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section examines how, at \nMoskva-Audit, international auditing standards became implicated in agendas of \neconomic and organisational change. Sections three and four trace the involvement of \nISAs in two phases of development of the firm. Section three examines how, between \n1994 and 1997, the standards became involved in attempts to formalise and rationalise \nMoskva-Audit's developing audit expertise. Here, the utilisation of ISAs in the \nestablishment of internal control structures and audit methodologies is investigated. It is \nshown how particularly in the early years of Moskva-Audit's development, the \n  13 \nstandards became linked up with \u201cmachine dreams\u201d (Mirowski, 2002) of auditing and \ninscribed in an organising logic that, to some extent, rested on Soviet ideals of scientific \nmanagement and control. Section four examines how, between 1997 and 2002, the \nstandards became involved in strategies and struggles to enhance the firm's international \nrecognition. Here, the role of ISAs in attempts to gain access to global audit markets \nand audit communities is discussed. In 2002, the international ambitions of Moskva-\nAudit culminated in the firm\u2019s membership of a large international auditing network \nand the re-branding of the organisation in accordance with the name of that network. \nWorking with ISAs helped Moskva-Audit to enter such a network, but only by \nincorporating itself within the network was it possible for the firm to be defined and \ninternationally accepted as \u201cworking according to standards\u201d. The fifth and final section \nconcludes the paper with a discussion of the implications of this finding with respect to \nthe general prospects and limits of projects of international audit standardisation. \nISAs and Agendas of Change \nMoskva-Audit\u2019s history is inextricably linked to Russia\u2019s move from socialism to \ncapitalism. Like many other Russian auditing firms, Moskva-Audit started off its life as \na small, self-financed Soviet consulting firm in 1990. Under Gorbachev, the Soviet \ngovernment welcomed the foundation of privately organised consulting firms as part of \na wider move to encourage market-based economic reform. Firms like Moskva-Audit \nwere one of the ways in which the government hoped to realise its plans of economic \ndecentralisation, privatisation and commercialisation. In 1992, Moskva-Audit began to \ndevelop its audit practice. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, government officials as well \nas academics had begun to promote Western-oriented auditing as a mechanism to \nimagine and realise governmental schemes of market-driven economic reform \n(Bychkova, 1996; Danilevsky, 1990, 1991). In 1991, Danilevsky, who at that time \nheaded the major inspection and control division of the Ministry of Finance, for \nexample wrote: \nThe presence of enterprises and organisations with different forms of property urgently \nrequires the foundation of self-financed [khozraschetny] control organs, i.e. auditing \nservices. The organisation of a web of audit firms is the beginning of a genuine introduction \nof economic principles of financial control, which are based on contractual, commercial \nrelations between the auditors and the audited enterprises and other organisations. \n(Danilevsky, 1991, p. 6) \n  14 \nIn the same year, two of his colleagues wrote: \nCompletely new forms of control should accompany the market economy; one form of \nthose [new controls, A.M.] is auditing. [\u2026] In developed countries, audit services make up \none of the strands of big business. A thoughtful adoption of auditing services in our country \ncould have a huge social and organisational impact on the improvement of the management \nof industry in our developing market economy. [\u2026] It is necessary to learn quickly and \nintensively more about Western audit expertise. \n(Bukhgalterskii uchet, 1991, No. 1, p. 37) \nThe collapse of the communist system and an envisaged marketisation of economic \nrelations had set the scene for the replacement of the system of Soviet state control with \nforms of Western-oriented audit professionalism. In 1993, the government adopted the \n\u201cTemporary Rules of Auditing in the Russian Federation\u201d, approved by presidential \ndecree No. 2263, in December 1993, and made audits mandatory for a large number of \nbusiness entities. Following the decree, audits became compulsory for all public joint-\nstock companies, banks, insurance companies, investment institutions, joint ventures \nand companies whose total revenues exceeded 500,000 MS (minimum monthly \nsalaries), or whose total assets were worth more than 200,000 MS (based on net book \nvalue).8 \nThe introduction of mandatory audits opened up for Moskva-Audit, as for many other \nnewly founded Russian audit firms, important new business opportunities in auditing. \nBut audit objectives and audit functions were still largely undefined, and the boundaries \nbetween practices of socialist inspection and capitalist auditing appeared to be \nextremely blurred. The establishment of Russian commercial audit firms did not \nautomatically lead to recognisable changes in inspection practice. In the beginning, the \nterm \u201cauditing\u201d was primarily used to demarcate a new control area, namely the control \nof operations carried out by newly established private enterprises, rather than to denote \nchanges in actual inspection practice. The term \u201caudit\u201d had been introduced, but the \npractical meaning of audits, and what made them distinct from inspections, still had to \nbe worked out (see e.g. Bychkova, 1996; Danilevsky, 1990, 1991, 1995a, b). In this \ncontext, international auditing standards gained increasing attention. \nThe standards were discussed as a mechanism through which new audit professionalism \ncould be articulated and demonstrated. They were seen as a device with which to \n                                                 \n8\n In 1997, 500,000 MS equalled approximately 7 million US-Dollars (Enthoven, Sokolov, Bychkova, \nKovalev & Semenova, 1998, p. 87). \n  15 \nimagine the unknown. They constituted something tangible, readily available and \ninternationally validated, and which auditors could refer to in their work. At Moskva-\nAudit, international auditing standards came to be put forward as a device that could \nhelp the firm and its clients link up with the Western world, define a new identity and \nrealise dreams of market-oriented development. As one of Moskva-Audit\u2019s senior \nauditors put it: \nFor our company ISAs are important, because they enhance our prestige. If a firm offers \nservices in accordance with international standards, I think that this is an entry to a more, \nwell, to a higher level. The business reputation of the firm will be much higher and [its \nservices] more expensive. \n(Interview No. 3, 2002) \nThe Deputy Director and Head of Audit Methodology stated in this respect: \nInternational standards set an example for best world practice. To show that our audits \nfollow general principles, that they are of high quality, we have to employ international \nstandards. \n(Interview No. 1, 2001) \nThe use and circulation of the standards was reinforced by the strong presence of the big \ninternational accounting firms in the emerging Russian audit market. Since the late \n1980s, the then Big Six international accounting firms (Pricewaterhouse, KPMG, \nCoopers & Lybrand, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young and Arthur Andersen) had \nbegun to open up offices in Russia. Soon, they assumed a central position in the \ndeveloping Russian audit market.9 The Russian business press portrayed them as \u201cthe \nleaders of the international audit and consulting industry \u2013 in the world and in Russia\u201d \n(see e.g. Ekspert, No. 35, 16.09.1996), as organisations \u201cwith many years of experience \nand worldwide prominence, prestige and reputation\u201c (Kommersant, No. 46, \n22.11.1993). According to the business journal Ekspert, in the first half of 1998 the Big \nSix together earned 250-280 million Russian Roubles (in terms of revenues) in the \nRussian audit market, representing about two thirds of the revenues earned altogether by \nthe hundred largest Russian audit firms at that time (see Ekspert, No. 42, 09.11.1998). \nBy the end of 1998, after the merger of Pricewaterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, the \nBig Five held approximately a 70%-75% share of the Russian audit market (Ekspert, \n                                                 \n9\n For a detailed account of how one of the Big Six invested in the former Soviet Union see Cooper, \nGreenwood, Hinings & Brown (1998). \n  16 \nNo. 11, 22.03.1999).10 In Russia, the big international accounting firms promoted ISAs \nas guarantors of audit quality and the benchmark of \u201cgood practice\u201d. The firms referred \nexplicitly to the standards in their own work and audit reports, and they participated \nactively in the compilation of official Russian translations of the standards. Further, \nthey promoted the ISAs \u2013 together with International Accounting Standards (IAS) \u2013 at \nconferences and workshops dealing with matters of Russian accounting and audit \nreform. \nFor many of the newly founded Russian audit businesses, the big international \naccounting firms functioned as role models. The Big Six, which became later the Big \nFive and subsequently the Big Four, were seen as organisations which had the expertise, \ninternational connectedness and economic success that many of the more ambitious \nRussian audit firms aspired to acquire. Also the management of Moskva-Audit tried to \nmodel itself on the big international accounting firms. It wanted to turn the Russian firm \ninto an internationally recognised business; \u201ca real alternative to the big six firms\u201d, as \nthe director and founder once remarked.11 The adoption of international auditing \nstandards was seen as an important step in the realisation of such ideals.12 \nMoskva-Audit began introducing the standards in the mid-1990s. As will be shown in \nmore detail later, a dual functionality was ascribed to the standards. Internally, the \nstandards were promoted as templates on the basis of which new organisational \nhierarchies and structures should be devised. The standards were introduced as a means \nto organise, demonstrate and rationalise audit expertise. It was hoped that \u201cworking with \nstandards\u201d would improve Moskva-Audit\u2019s measures of internal control and enhance \nthe economic value of the firm\u2019s audit activities. The standards were expected to help \nthe management of Moskva-Audit to establish structures that would make it possible for \nthem to turn auditing into an efficient, organisationally manageable process. Further, it \nwas hoped that externally, i.e. to outside audiences, such as clients, regulators and \n                                                 \n10\n Out of the Big Five, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had by far the largest market share. In 1998, for \nexample, the firm earned more than ten times as much as the largest Russian audit firm (in terms of \nrevenues) (Ekspert, No. 11, 22.03.1999). \n11\n The founder and director stated this in a newspaper article of a popular Russian business paper in 1998. \nFor reasons of confidentiality, the exact reference details cannot be disclosed. \n12\n Of course, it should be noted that not all founders of Russian audit businesses modelled their \norganisations on the big international accounting firms. Especially in the 1990s, before the 2001 Russian \naudit law was adopted, the Russian audit market was populated by a large number of very small firms \nwhich often had only one to ten employees. These firms were locally oriented and provided mainly \nRussian bookkeeping, tax advisory and statutory audit services to smaller organisations, or they were \nhighly specialised in a specific industry sector and served almost exclusively a couple of larger client \norganisations (see e.g. Ekspert, No. 35, 16.09.1996 and Ekspert, No. 11, 22.03.1999). \n  17 \ncompetitors, \u201cworking according to standards\u201d would provide Moskva-Audit with an \nidentity that underlined its pioneering role in the development of Russian audit expertise \nand demonstrated the firm\u2019s level of professionalism. It was expected that the standards \nwould provide outside parties with a clearer, internally validated picture of what \nmodern, capitalist auditing was about. ISAs came to be regarded as a core element in a \nregime of post-Soviet representation, through which Moskva-Audit hoped to overcome \nthe legacies of the socialist past and gain entry to new worlds of Western audit \nprofessionalism. \nBut the rhetorical appeal of the standards did not easily translate into their technical \noperationalisation. Working with the standards involved much more than putting a copy \nof the ISAs on the bookshelf. As already suggested, international auditing standards are \nnot effective by themselves. ISAs have to be made to work. And in the case of Moskva-\nAudit, the standards had to be taken out of the book and actively made part of the \norganisation. On the one hand, the ISAs had to be provided with infrastructures that \nwould allow people to work with, and have control over, the rules. On the other hand, \nexternal parties needed to be convinced that one was working according to standards. \nDevices and relations had to be created that allowed the firm to demonstrate and \ncommunicate compliance with the standards. Such processes of organisational \nlocalisation and public certification were not trouble-free, nor could their course be \ndetermined in advance. \nFirms like Moskva-Audit imagined themselves as a professional community \ncomparable to those in the West, but the realisation of this aspiration was rooted in local \nspecificity and accompanied by heterogeneity and difference. Especially in the early \nyears of Moskva-Audit\u2019s development, between 1994 and 1997, the standards became \nimplicated in an organising logic that, to some extent, rested on Soviet traditions of \nscientific management and ideals of total controllability. In the following, we will \ninvestigate how ISAs can become involved in different, locally variable and conflicting \nstandardising strategies. We will also examine what consequences this has for attempts \nto establish ISAs as a global connection device. \n  18 \n\u201cMachine Dreams\u201d13 \nThe first two centres from which the ISAs began to be circulated throughout Moskva-\nAudit were its Audit Methodology and Audit Quality Control Departments. Here, initial \nsteps were taken to create an administrative system through which the standards could \nbe rendered operable. The international auditing standards were to be embedded in \nheavily rationalised and formal processes aimed at the objectification and \ndepersonalisation of audit expertise. \u201cMachine dreams\u201d (Mirowski, 2002) of \nmodernisation, rooted in ideals of scientific control, organisational legibility14 and \ntechnical efficiency, accompanied Moskva-Audit\u2019s early audit standardisation projects. \nThe Audit Methodology and Audit Quality Control Departments were created in the \nmid-1990s, the period when Moskva-Audit had started to take on its first bigger audit \nassignments. Initially, the Audit Methodology Department was staffed with five people: \nYuri Litkov15 and Alexey Yakunin who had both previously worked for two large \ninternational accounting firms in Moscow; Elena Lutskaya who had worked for \nMoskva-Audit as an auditor since 1992; and two administrative assistants. The Audit \nQuality Control Department was founded in September 1996. Initially staffed with four \npeople, the Department grew rapidly in the following years. The Audit Methodology \nDepartment and the Audit Quality Control Department were located at the interface \nbetween the external representation and internal organisation of audit work. In both \ndepartments, international auditing standards were promoted as an instrument that could \nprovide the firm with a frame of externally accepted regularity and internally \nmanageable efficiency. The standards were seen as a regulatory tool, through which \nsocietal concerns about due professional care could be projected into the firm and, vice \nversa, the firm\u2019s devotion to modern audit technology could be communicated to \nsociety \u2013 in particular clients, regulators, peers and other international business partners. \nIssues of internal quality assurance and demands to explicitly demonstrate professional \ndue care had become all the more pressing for Russian audit firms when \u2013 in 1996 \u2013 the \nCentral Bank stated its concerns about the quality of bank audits (see e.g. Finansovaya \n                                                 \n13\n This heading is borrowed from the title of Mirwoski (2002). \n14\n The notion of \u201clegibility\u201d was first developed and used by Scott (1998). In his work, Scott uses the term \nto describe processes of formalisation, categorisation and standardisation, with the help of which modern \nstates learnt \u201cto see\u201d and \u201cknow\u201d their terrain and people. In the context of this paper, \u201corganisational \nlegibility\u201d is used to describe activities of codification and documentation aimed at making audit \nactivities \u201clegible\u201d, visible and governable, from the standpoint of the audit organisation. \n15\n For reasons of confidentiality, all names have been changed. \n  19 \ngazeta, 1996, No. 43). Standardised audit methodology, explicated in formal rules and \nprocedures, was presented by regulators, academics and the big audit firms as a \nmechanism through which the quality and professionalism of audit activities could be \nsignificantly improved. But as noted earlier, ISAs in isolation are little more than vague \ntextual documents, which neither prescribe nor explain what it would actually mean to \nuse them. Apart from the relatively short working experiences of Litkov and Yakunin in \ntwo of the big international accounting firms in Moscow, the people at Moskva-Audit \ndid not have any knowledge of how the standards had been applied elsewhere in the \nworld. In any event, the standards do not form a stable reference system. International \nauditing standards are frequently revised, updated and changed. The International \nAuditing and Assurance Standards Board regularly reviews existing ISAs, removes old \nstandards and develops new standards.16 For the people at Moskva-Audit, the standards \nrepresented a moving target, constantly changing and therefore not easy to pin down \nand stabilise within Moskva-Audit\u2019s own structures. Furthermore, at that time there did \nnot even exist an officially authorised Russian translation of the ISAs. When Moskva-\nAudit began to make use of the standards, the first translation attempts had only just \nbegun, and they were not considered very reliable. One member of Moskva-Audit\u2019s \nAudit Division stated in this respect: \nI remember that when we began to work [in auditing], first of all, it was not possible to find \nthe standards in Russian. Some translations existed, but only in a very fragmented way. \nThese were terrible translations. It would have been better if these had not existed at all. \n(Interview No. 2, 2002) \nThe professional association titled the \u2018Russian Collegium of Auditors\u2019 was one of the \nfirst groups that pushed the Russian translation of ISAs. In the mid-1990s other \norganisations, such as audit firms and academic institutions also began the process of \ntranslating the standards. But it was only in the year 2000 when these single efforts \nmerged into a single, uniform and IFAC-authorised translation. \nThe adoption of the standards was further complicated by developments in the national \nregulatory scene. When Moskva-Audit began the introduction of the standards, the \nRussian government had also started with the development of a set of national auditing \nrules (Danilevsky, 1994). These rules had been closely modelled on the International \nStandards on Auditing, but they did not constitute literal translations. Danilevsky, \n                                                 \n16\n For example, between 1999 and 2001 the Board had revised ISA 240 on fraud and error; published a \nnew Auditing Practice Statement on the audit of derivative financial instruments and issued two Exposure \nDrafts with revisions to ISA 700, The Auditor\u2019s Report on Financial Statements. \n  20 \nOstrovsky and Guttseit (2001, p. 11), three state servants who were involved in the \ndrafting of the first set of the Russian standards, stated in this respect: \nThe underlying principles of ISAs were almost automatically incorporated in Russian \nstandards. But, of course, one could not do without changes and amendments. [\u2026] \nLocalization was sought at the outset, which manifested itself both in the wording of the \nRussian equivalents of ISAs and in audit rules that do not have ISA prototypes. \nWhen Moskva-Audit began the adoption of the standards, the national audit rules were \nstill in the process of being drafted and had not yet been officially endorsed. But it was \nexpected that they would become mandatory in the near future.17 All of these faltering \ndevelopments disturbed the stability of the standards. On their journey into and through \nthe Russian auditing world, the ISAs began to connect up a variety of different contexts \nand actors, each of whom accorded them differing importance and interpretations. As a \nconsequence, the auditing standards became a rather blurred and multiplied reference \npoint. The people at Moskva-Audit had to deal with this confusion. They had to find a \nway through the different interpretations, Russian translations and governmental \nregulations that had been attached to the standards, so that they might work \u2018according \nto the standards\u2019.18 \nMoskva-Audit\u2019s Audit Methodology Department tried to deal with the duplication and \nlocal differentiation of the standards through a concentration on the similarities of the \naudit process steps described. Standards that were specific to and internal to the firm \nwere created, in attempts to fuse the Russian and international rules. Instead of \njuxtaposing Russian and international audit standards, they were re-joined. In the \nopening paragraphs of Moskva-Audit\u2019s internal audit standards, explicit reference was \nmade to both the international and Russian audit standards. The internal rules were built \non excerpts taken from both the Russian standards and the international rules. To \nemphasise international similarity, all texts were permeated with Western audit \nterminology. Reference was made to the conduct of \u201canalytical procedures\u201d \n[analiticheskie protsedury], \u201ctests of internal control systems\u201d [testy sredstv \n                                                 \n17\n With the adoption of the federal audit law in August 2001, national auditing standards have to be \nfollowed when conducting Russian statutory audits. The new national auditing standards follow closely \nthe text of the international standards, but they still do not constitute exact one-to-one translations. The \nnational auditing rules, for example, differ in terms of length, detail and added legal requirements. For \nexample, they include detailed regulations about educational requirements for auditors, legal rights and \nobligations of audit firms, procedures for the conclusion of audit contracts and recommendations for the \nperformance of tax audits (Remizov, 2001, pp. 5-21). \n18\n For an insightful, more general discussion of the nexus between accounting, language, culture and \nthought see Evans\u2019s (2004) analysis of \u201cLanguage, Translation and the Problem of International \nAccounting Communication\u201d. \n  21 \nvnutrennogo kontrolya], \u201clevels of audit risk\u201d [urovny auditorskogo riska] and \n\u201cmateriality thresholds\u201d [urovny material\u2019nosti]. \nFurther, the Methodology Department tried to re-enforce the uniformity of the standards \nby embedding them in standardised, machine-like audit practices. The elusiveness of the \nstandards was addressed through the establishment of a well-structured apparatus of \nformal rules. Auditing became couched in a mathematical language of planning and \ncontrol. Excel sheet templates, for example, were developed to aid the mathematical \nmodelling of audit risk. Algorithms were designed to standardise the calculation of \nmateriality levels. And detailed statistical sampling procedures were set out to formalise \nthe selection of audit samples.19 Thus, the standards became embedded in a very \nspecific strategy of rule following. They became implicated in a strategy that focused on \nprocedural orderliness, accurate documentation and the formally rational appearance of \naudit activities. Litkov, Head of Audit Methodology at Moskva-Audit between 1996 \nand 2001, described such a formalistic-mathematical approach to auditing and audit \nstandardisation in the following way: \nAudits should require a minimum of creativity [judgement] and a maximum of formality. \n[\u2026] Auditing is only a technology, a process similar to an assembly line, where specially \ndrilled [nataskanny] staff perform a set of procedures related to a certain algorithm within \nshort time and to the required quality. The [audit] process contains a lot of recurring routine \nelements that can be highly automated. [\u2026] Standards make it possible to create an \nefficient system of coherent procedures for [such] audit staff activities.20 \nIn the auditing literature, the approach that Litkov describes has been described as \n\u201cmechanistic\u201d. Dirsmith and McAllister (1982), for example, distinguish between \n\u201cmechanistic\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d audit approaches. According to them, mechanistic audit \napproaches rely heavily on formalised procedures, whereas unstructured, organic \napproaches provide more scope for judgement and individual practical reasoning. At \nMoskva-Audit, the mechanistic images of auditing and audit standardisation were \ngrounded at least in part in the former professional backgrounds of Litkov and his \n                                                 \n19\n It should be noted that such mathematical approaches to auditing and audit standardisation were \nprevalent in many Russian audit firms at the time when this field study was carried out. When people \nbegan to redefine audit practices in accordance with Western audit models and standards in the early \n1990s, much attention was generally given to \u201cmathematical\u201d audit issues, such as statistical audit \nsampling, the mathematical modelling of audit risk and calculations of materiality levels. This interest in \nthe mathematical modelling of auditing is also reflected in academic and professional journal articles. \nSince the early 1990s, accounting journals, such as \u201cBukhgalterskii uchet\u201d [The Bookkeeper\u2019s Account] \nand \u201cAuditorskiye Vedomosti\u201d [Auditing News] have been publishing a large number of articles \ndiscussing the mathematics of audit risk models, the pros and cons of different sampling technologies and \nissues connected to materiality level calculations. \n20\n The quote was taken from an article Litkov had published in 1999. \n  22 \ngroup, together with the established traditions of Soviet scientific management and \ncontrol. Especially in the 1960s and 1970s, Soviet economic planning accorded great \nsignificance to administrative science and mathematical modelling (see e.g. \nConyngham, 1982; Thompson & Vidmer, 1983). Subjects, such as cybernetics and \nlinear programming, were seen as promising approaches through which, at least in \ntheory, scientific control of the Soviet economy could be achieved (Thompson & \nVidmer, 1983, p. 79). Litkov had obtained a degree in mathematics and administrative \nscience during the Soviet period. Before his career as an auditor, he had worked as a \nprogrammer for the Soviet military. Yakunin, his colleague, had worked in economic \nplanning for one of the Soviet branch ministries.21 These experiences reinforced beliefs \nthat auditing standards could be concretised and pinned down with the help of a set of \nwell-defined procedures and algorithmic decision tools. As Litkov expressed it in an \ninterview: \nI think that it is quite easy for mathematicians and programmers to adapt to the auditing \nsphere. For us it is quite easy to deal with such issues as risk analysis, sampling \ntechnologies, the calculation of materiality levels etc. [\u2026]. Everything which concerns \nauditing, well, that doesn\u2019t have any national cores. That is a technology, a science; you \nhave plans; you have instruments. \n(Interview No. 1, 2001) \nThe adoption of a mechanistic approach to auditing and audit standardisation was \nfurther stimulated by the extreme levels of institutional uncertainty surrounding \nMoskva-Audit. During the early 1990s, government as well as non-state organisations \nand individuals experimented with a range of different economic and regulatory models \nwith the aim of furthering economic and political transition. The transition period was a \nperiod in flux. Processes of privatisation, liberalisation and deregulation had moved \npost-Soviet Russian society into a state of extreme structural instability and institutional \nuncertainty. As Elster, Offe & Preuss put it (1998, p. 34), society was \u201cfelt to be in a \nstate of disorder and fragmentation\u201d. In this context, excessive proliferation of rules can \nbe seen as the outcome of the desire for order and stability (Elster, Offe & Preuss, \n1998). As Litkov described it in an interview, activities of rule development became \nassociated with stability and certainty: \nOur auditors want to have rules and standards that describe in detail what they should do, \nand what they don\u2019t need to do. The international standards show you how you should \n                                                 \n21\n The cases of Litkov and Yakunin are not unique. Many of the bigger Russian audit firms hired former \nnatural scientists, engineers and state bureaucrats for the development of their audit methodologies. \n  23 \nthink. Our [internal] rules show you how to think and what to do in concrete situations. [\u2026] \nIf I had to show you all our internal documents, that wouldn\u2019t be just two or three books, as \nin the international firms, but several cupboards full of paper. \n(Interview No. 1, 2001) \nAs with the international auditing standards, Moskva-Audit\u2019s internal rules were \norganised according to a series of standardised process steps, beginning with rules on \naudit planning, the assessment of audit risk, the formulation of audit engagement letters \nand then leading on to the collection of audit evidence, the documentation of audit \nprocesses and the formulation of standardised audit reports. In addition, internal audit \nmanuals, methodical instructions and audit risk templates were developed to delineate \nexplicit spheres of audit action. \nCodifying Compliance \nThe definition and evaluation of compliance with standards was grounded largely in \npaperwork. In this respect, one could say that Moskva-Audit embraced the standards in \na way similar to many Western audit firms (see e.g. Power, 1999; Van Maanen & \nPentland, 1994). The basis for matching work to standards became the collection and \nstorage of standardised \u201cdocumented representations\u201d (Garfinkel, 1967\/1999) of audit \nwork. It was believed that standardised, documented audit accounts would enable \nparticipants to re-construct past courses of action as \u201cshowcases\u201d of proper auditing. On \nthe other hand, we can observe that the collection and storage of such showcases \nbecame embedded in a very specific, locally distinctive way of thinking about auditing \nand audit standardisation. New, Western-oriented \u201cform-giving\u201d devices (Th\u00e9venot, \n1984) were adopted to aid the planning, control and documentation of audit work, but \nthe application of such Western-oriented routines, to a large extent, was still rooted in \ncontrol and management practices stemming from the Soviet period. \nOne of the core technologies adopted from one of the big international accounting firms \nto aid the operationalisation of international auditing standards took the form of a \nstandardised, fifty-nine-page long documentation index. Originally, the documentation \nindex had been developed by one of the then Big Five firms for their own internal \ncontrol and documentation purposes. The documentation index was imported by \nMoskva-Audit from a big international firm, not only to aid control but also to \ndemonstrate international openness and enhance similarity with Western firms. The \nWestern origin of the index underlined its authoritativeness and alleged adequacy. \n  24 \nThe indexing system compartmentalised the audit process into sections of audit \nplanning, the evaluation of audit risk, the auditor\u2019s knowledge of the audited business, \nthe description of internal control systems, results of performed audit procedures, etc. \nEach audit activity was provided with a number. Under numbers from 1,000 to 1,199, \nfor example, activities concerning audit planning were reported. From 5,000 to 5,999 \nthe audit of assets was documented. Indices ranging from 6,000 to 6,999 were used for \nreports on the audit of liabilities. Attached to the indices were special instructions, for \nexample for the determination of audit risk, and models of working papers. \nThe indexing system provided the auditors with a frame of objectification that helped \nthem establish a predictable, routinised environment for auditing, an environment that \ncould be ordered and controlled largely independent of the specificities and \ncomplexities of actual audit objects. In so doing, the indexing system constituted much \nmore than a neutral, technical device aiding the production of accurate accounts of \n\u201cwhat happened\u201d. The indexing system itself was a central part of a bigger \norganisational apparatus of charts, rules, lists and other form-giving devices that did not \njust reflect, but made it possible to perform work in accordance with standards.22 The \ndocuments collected and stored with the help of the indexing system became \nconstitutive of work in accordance with standards in a way that reinforced Moskva-\nAudit\u2019s focus on descriptive accuracy and administrative orderliness. Especially in the \nearly 1990s, at Moskva-Audit, much attention was paid to the checking of single \noperations. The audit tests focused on detailed transaction testing. In comparison with \nWestern contexts of audit activity (see e.g. Power, 1999), much less attention was paid \nto analytical procedures or the audit of the control systems of a business.23 Work in \naccordance with standards came to be associated with images of rational bureaucratic \norder and formal rule-following. Emphasis was placed on the disciplinary character of \naudit rules. It was believed that the application of standards could be ensured through \nenhancing the level of control over individual practitioners and reducing the scope for \nindividual judgement. As the Head of the International Audit Department at Moskva-\nAudit described it: \n                                                 \n22\n The performative role of instruments like the indexing system is not just a specificity of our case, but \nhas been documented elsewhere as well. See e.g. Power (1999) and van Maanen and Pentland (1994). \n23\n The ISAs define analytical procedures as \u201cevaluations of financial information made by a study of \nplausible relationships among both financial and non-financial data\u201d (IFAC, 2006, p. 228). Tests of \ncontrol are performed to check \u201cthe operating effectiveness of controls in preventing, or detecting and \ncorrecting, material misstatements\u201d (IFAC, 2006, p. 248). \n  25 \nThe quality of audit work should not depend on the personality\u2026 on the person that came \nto work for the organisation. We only have a great deal of certainty that everything is done \nwith quality, if a person works in accordance with standardised programmes. \n(Interview No. 6, 2002)24 \nSuch projects of formal standardisation and codification were reinforced by the \ndemands of outside parties. Western agencies, such as the World Bank or the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), would only award audit contracts \nto firms who could explicitly demonstrate that standardised, publicly visible, systems of \ninternal quality control had been installed. Also, Russian regulatory authorities, when \ncarrying out audit quality controls, were primarily interested in determining whether \ndetailed administrative procedures had been established by the audit firms. When this \ncase study was conducted, Russian auditors had not been sued for professional \nnegligence. But observing the court activities of their international counterparts, \nRussian audit firms imagined that this could be the case in the future and therefore saw \nthe establishment of formal controls and documentary mechanisms as an important step \nin preparing themselves for such events. As Moskva-Audit\u2019s Deputy Director \ncommented in an accounting newsletter in 1999: \nAudit rules should become the most important argument in the review of court \ninvestigations against audit organisations with respect to allegations of professional \nnegligence.25 \nParallel to the indexing system, Moskva-Audit\u2019s Quality Control Department developed \na numerical compliance code.26 With the help of the code, expertise was represented in \na standardised format, allowing it to be ranked, compared and evaluated. The code \nconsisted of a list of thirty-six different criteria which audit quality controllers had to \ntake into account when assessing compliance. The criteria had been subdivided into \nthree main sections. The sections focused on the correctness and completeness of audit \nwork with respect to: audit procedures performed; audit reports written; and audit files \n                                                 \n24\n It should be noted, that such a prescriptive approach to audit standardisation is not only a Russian \nspecificity. The recent \u201cclarity project\u201d of the IAASB (International Audit and Assurance Standards \nBoard) shows that the auditing profession in Europe is generally divided about the level of prescription to \nbe established by auditing standards. As we can read in a recent article of the journal Accountancy: \n\u201cSome take the view that audit quality is likely to be improved by having detailed prescriptive standards \n[\u2026]. Others, including the APB [British Audit Practices Board], favour a more principles-based approach \nrecognising that many of the key features of good auditing are dependent on auditor experience and \njudgement\u201d (Grant, 2006, p. 84). \n25\n For reasons of confidentiality more precise details about the source of the quote cannot be disclosed. \n26\n In the development of internal controls and documentary mechanisms, the Department based itself \nlargely on ISA 220, the international standard dealing with \u201cQuality Control of Audit Work\u201d (IFAC, \n2001, pp. 158-162). The compliance code had been developed by the Quality Control Department from \nscratch and, unlike the documentation index, had not been taken on from other international institutions. \n  26 \nassembled. The control criteria ranged from general questions asking, for example, for \nan overall assessment of the correspondence of the contents of audit procedures, audit \nreports and audit files with internal rules and Russian laws, to more specific questions \naddressing issues of documentary uniformity and formal accuracy. Quality controllers \nhad to consider questions such as: does the structure of the audit report comply with the \nstructure provided in the standards; are sentences clearly formulated; is every remark of \nthe auditors backed up with evidence, e.g. source documents; does a memorandum on \naudit planning exist; has a statement on the independence of auditors been attached; \nhave materiality levels been correctly calculated; does the selection of the audit samples \ncorrespond with the firm\u2019s internal sampling rules? \nThe audit quality controllers ranked the extent to which each criterion had been met on \na scale from zero (for non-compliance) to one (for 100% compliance). In the second \nstep, the ranking given for each criterion was added up to give a total score. The results \nwere entered into a table. On the basis of the table, diagrams were created visualising \nthe quality of audit work delivered by each audit team. Regularly, these diagrams were \nforwarded to the director and owner of Moskva-Audit to inform him about the \nperformance of his workers. In so doing, the codification system actively helped \nconfigure compliance. The compliance scores, which stood at the end of each quality \nassessment, helped attribute individual acts of judgment to the outcome of rule-\nfollowing. They made it possible for controllers to conceal difficulties related to \nprocesses of quality assessment and supplied them with a grid that made compliance \nlegible from the standpoint of the organisation. To quote Power (1999), the system \nmade compliance with the standards \u201cauditable\u201d. It helped the quality controllers at \nMoskva-Audit arrive at a common representation of diverse audit practices.27 The \ncontrol system might have intersected poorly with the day-to-day realities of audit work. \nNonetheless, it provided an important reference point that enabled the organisation to \nembed standards within its internal regulatory systems, and to demonstrate to regulatory \nand other bodies that audit standards were being realised. \nBut how far did these dimensions of regulatory conformity take Moskva-Audit? To \nwhat extent did the \u201cform-giving\u201d devices described above help turn the international \nauditing standards into a connecting device making it possible for Moskva-Audit to link \n                                                 \n27\n The above-mentioned points describe general functions of grading and performance measurement. For \nan insightful analysis of grading practices in schools see Kalthoff (1996). For a more general discussion \nof the objectifying qualities of quantification see Porter (1992). \n  27 \nup with Western audit worlds? As will be shown in the next section, although the \nstandards had been turned into a pervasive, circulating point of reference within the \nfirm, they did not constitute a narrow \u201cobligatory passage point\u201d that could be easily \ncontrolled and utilised to generate international acceptance. According to Latour (1987, \np. 150), \u201cobligatory passage points\u201d are constituted by things, events, persons and \nactivities which people have to pass if they want to belong to a certain group of actors \n(e.g. the accounting profession) or a specific network of activities (e.g. auditing \npractices). \u201cObligatory passage points\u201d refer to the means and processes by which \nthings, ideas or standards in our case, are turned into stable, \u201cindispensable\u201d entities \n(Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987, 1988). In the case of Moskva-Audit, attempts had been \nundertaken to incorporate and stabilise the standards within its audit manuals and \nmethodologies, but working with the standards did not automatically translate into the \nfirm becoming defined and classified as working according to international standards. It \nis this issue that we now turn to consider. \nStruggles for Recognition \nThe indexing system and the compliance code contributed to the creation and \nstabilisation of an administrative control system that reinforced images of orderliness \nand regularity. This led to an increased appearance of internal consistency and \nconformity, but it did not automatically bring about higher external acceptance, \nespecially not at the international level. At Moskva-Audit, ISAs had become linked up \nwith very specific, localised strategies of rule following and ideas of what an auditing \nstandard is. These were not easily compatible with Western, in particular Anglo-Saxon, \nideals of auditing and audit standardisation. What counted as \u201cworking in accordance \nwith standards\u201d was contested. It was challenged by the differing beliefs, demands and \nexpectations within which Moskva-Audit operated. A British audit partner who had \nworked for several years in a large international audit firm in Moscow remarked in this \nrespect: \nThere is a lot of debate. [\u2026] At one end of the spectrum you have the former Finance \nMinistry controllers [revizory] \u2013 their view of internal control is to re-perform everything. \nIf you get the same out of it, you are probably right. And then you get the other end of the \nspectrum, which I guess would be the Big Five [now Big Four, A.M.] trained professionals \nwith experience. These two got such absolutely opposite views of everything, and yet they \nare all part of the same profession. \n(Interview No. 33, 2001) \n  28 \nMoskva-Audit was operating in a differentiated environment. There existed different \nviews on what counted as auditing, on how to approach it and what its outcome should \nbe. Views differed, for example, with respect to the detail of regulation needed to ensure \naudit quality. Views differed also with respect to the objectives that audits should serve. \nOn the one hand, auditing and auditing standards were promoted as a means to enhance \nstate control and stimulate compliance with Russian taxation and accounting laws. Such \nperspectives were especially propagated by the Ministry of Finance and the Russian \ntaxation authorities (Danilevsky, 1994; Krikunov, 2001). Here, auditing standards were \nseen as an instrument of juridical regulation that could guide state authorities in the \nestablishment of a coherent system of regulatory oversight. \nOn the other hand, there existed more capital market-oriented views, which regarded \nauditing as a control mechanism that was called upon to enhance the information \ncontent of financial statements for economic decision makers; in particular private \nshareholders. Here, ISAs were regarded as broad principles in need of being grounded \nin individual expert judgement and Anglo-Saxon cultures of self-regulated \nprofessionalism. Such views were in particular articulated by the big international \naccounting firms operating in Moscow and multilateral agencies, such as the World \nBank, OECD and EBRD. At Moskva-Audit, the international auditing standards had \nbecome implicated in faithful, machine-like applications of rules, which high-ranking \nmembers of the big international accounting firms in particular sneered at. As the \nfollowing dialogue between two British audit partners who worked for a large \ninternational accounting firm in Moscow illustrates, Western, especially Anglo-Saxon, \naudit professionals saw auditing as something which cannot be learned from a book or \nthe text of international standards: \nAudit Partner 1: How many of them [international auditing standards] have you read this \nweek [audit partner 1 addresses audit partner 2 with a smile]? \nAudit Partner 2: I can\u2019t remember. It would be embarrassing, if I tried to remember what \norder they are in. \nAudit Partner 1: You know, that just does not make sense. I could never cite all the \nstandards by their title. This is something you just know. [\u2026] \nAudit Partner 2: You can\u2019t learn auditing. That is something you got to grow into. Auditing \nis a particularly psychology-based study; you don\u2019t learn that from a book. \nAudit Partner 1: A good auditor never looks at the law; never looks at the standards. He \nknows it, in its blood. He drank it from his mother\u2019s milk as it were. Ahm, law and \n  29 \nregulations all they do is formalise that, but if the basic culture is not there, then you have a \nbig problem.28 \nNo doubt this is an idealised and stereotypical Anglo-Saxon representation of audit \nexpertise. Nonetheless, this mirage of audit expertise as something that needs to be \ngrounded in individual experience and judgement, rather than adherence to rules, \nclashed with post-Soviet ideals of regulation and financial control. This disparity was \nfurther reinforced by the different accounting worlds Russian and Anglo-Saxon auditors \nwere operating in. In contrast to Anglo-Saxon accounting worlds, Russian accounting \nwas and still is much more focussed on compliance with tax regulations and \ngovernment decrees. It is centrally regulated, and the Chart of Accounts provides \ndetailed guidance on how to comply with Russian accounting rules (see e.g. Bakaev, \n2001; Kondrakov, 2004). In addition, we need to take into account that formal \nstructures travel more quickly than knowledge and expertise anchored in individual \nexperience (Drori, Meyer & Hwang, 2006; Westney, 1987). The formal texts of the \nauditing standards may have reached Russia quickly. But the connecting of worlds is \nmuch more than the arrival of formal standards. There is further to go before one can \nsay that the standards exist within an internationally accepted realm of auditing practice. \nThe Russian and Western audit worlds did not exist side by side, on the same horizontal \nplane. They were embedded in a hierarchical relationship. The breakdown of \ncommunism within Eastern Europe, and the attendant de-legitimisation of Soviet \ninstitutional structures, put Western audit firms and audit professionals in a position that \nallowed them to present themselves as superior to their Russian counterparts. The \nsupposedly successful capitalist societies of Western Europe and the United States had \nbecome important reference points for what post-communist Russian society aspired to \nbecome (see e.g. Pickles & Smith, 1998). The creation of new market-oriented political \nand economic structures, including the establishment of commercial auditing, relied to a \ngreat extent on the imitation and transplantation of Western patterns. This strengthened \nthe positioning of Western audit firms and professionals in the Russian audit market, \nwho had knowledge and experience on their side. By definition, their Russian \ncounterparts were lagging behind. \n                                                 \n28\n This dialogue was observed by the author during an informal meeting where the audit partners \ndiscussed the usefulness of conferences on international accounting and auditing standards prepared and \ndelivered by Western expatriates to Russian accountants and auditors. The interchange quoted above was \nprompted by a comment that the author made regarding the great popularity of such events. \n  30 \nThese continuing differences between Russian and international audit worlds thus \nplaced the specific regulatory traditions and local accountability styles of the Russian \naudit world in a curious and inferior position relative to the actors and agencies that had \nentered from the \u2018outside\u2019, from the West.29 In particular, the presence of the big \ninternational accounting firms on the Russian audit market contributed to the creation of \nfurther axes of local differentiation and particularisation. The international firms \nclaimed to be doing \u201ctruer\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d audits than their Russian counterparts on the \ngrounds of their longstanding experience, worldwide interconnectedness and general \nreputation. During interviews that were conducted with partners from Western audit \nfirms, respondents frequently made distinctions between the kind of audits \u201cwe, the \ninternationals\u201d do, and the kind of audits \u201cthey, the Russians\u201d perform. This depended \non a contrast between the \u201cexperienced\u201d Western application of international standards \non the one hand, and the \u201cinexperienced\u201d Russian applications on the other. The \nfollowing quotes illustrate some of the differences that were ascribed to Russian \nauditing by Western practitioners. A British senior audit partner who had worked for \nseveral years in a big international firm in Moscow, for example, pointed to the different \nlevels of experience: \nWhat they are trying to develop in Russia has taken decades, if not centuries, in the West. I \nthink there is a pretty genuine interest in looking at how it\u2019s done in the West and saying \n\u2018We must do this\u2019 or something like it. But you cannot do it overnight, if there is no culture \nof having done this. [\u2026] In the Western world, you have years of experience. You have \nthousands of practitioners. Here, you don\u2019t have that. [\u2026] What\u2019s missing is the experience \nand maybe the common sense. \n(Interview No. 32, 2001) \nAnother senior, but Russian, audit partner who also worked for a big international firm \nin Moscow emphasised differences in professional approaches: \nWhen talking about Russian audits and international audits, one needs to be careful to \ndistinguish between them. If you take the [Russian and international] audit standards, in \nprinciple, they are not much different from each other. [\u2026] But you find differences in their \npractical adoption, in the practice of auditing. [\u2026] They [the Russian firms], for example, \ndon\u2019t understand this concept where, during the audit process, you look at the financial \nstatements as a whole. For them only the individual transactions are very important. \n(Interview No. 35, 2002) \n                                                 \n29\n Cooper et al. (1998) make a very similar point about the constitutive effects of national stereotyping. \nAnalysing the behaviour of managers in multinational accounting firms, they aptly illustrate the complex \nand problematic nature of the idea of an \u2018international\u2019 orientation. \n  31 \nLooking back on his time in Russia during the early 1990s, a British ex audit partner, \nwho also had worked for a large audit firm, reflected more critically: \nRussian auditing grew as a business in the time I was there. But it was held in very low \nesteem when I first went out. It was very much a pure compliance exercise, nobody really \ncared about it. [\u2026] And we [the Westerners] were quite ignorant. \n(Interview No. 41, 2002) \nThese quotes are not offered as a way of testifying the \u201cactual\u201d realities of Russian \nauditing. Whether based on first-hand experience or stereotypes, in both cases the above \nremarks reflect and contribute to the creation of \u201can ideology of difference\u201d (Said, \n1985), which frustrated the connecting potential of the international auditing standards. \nWork conducted in accordance with international standards came to be rooted in \ndivisions of global and local, Western and post-Soviet audit labour. Discourses about \nlocal specificity furthered the incorporation of the standards in hierarchies of expertise \nthat were promulgated by the big international accounting firms and their networks. As \na consequence, practices of Russian firms claiming to perform work in accordance with \ninternational auditing standards were de-legitimised. Work in accordance with \ninternational standards came to be marketable only for those firms that were already \ninternationally connected and enjoyed worldwide recognition. Also, Moskva-Audit \ncame to feel the power of the big international firms. For many years, Moskva-Audit\u2019s \naudit division stood in the shadow of the activities of the big Western firms. As the \nfollowing remark of a senior auditor from April 2001 illustrates, the area of \ninternational auditing was neither a lucrative, nor widely accepted business: \nUsually, ISA-audited financial statements are required by clients who plan to sell shares \nabroad, who go for the international markets. But unfortunately, in these cases the big \ninternational firms prevail in the market, because their stamp counts for much more than \nours does. Because [abroad] nobody knows what [Moskva-Audit] is. And consequently, if \none talks about international audits, usually the Big Five are chosen. \n(Interview No. 6, 2002) \nThe quote indicates that working with international auditing standards had not been \nenough to enhance Moskva-Audit\u2019s international acceptance. The international \nstandards did not fulfil their role as a mechanism for connecting the firm and its clients \nwith international markets. Or at least they were insufficient on their own. To become \nwidely accepted on an international scale, Moskva-Audit had to do much more than \nadopt standards. To become part of the international audit world, Moskva-Audit had to \nfind allies who already enjoyed worldwide acceptance. As Mary Douglas (1987, p. 59) \n  32 \nargues, \u201csameness is not a quality that can be recognised in things themselves; it is \nconferred upon elements within a coherent scheme.\u201d Analogies have to be agreed upon. \nSameness, at least to a large extent, is conferred and fixed by the institutions that \ncomprise cultural conventions, shared belief systems, common cognitive schemes and \nother social and cultural structures (Douglas, 1987, pp. 45-67). To be widely recognised \nand able to overcome local boundaries, Moskva-Audit needed wider institutional \nsupport. It had to re-connect itself and the standards that it worked with to the wider sets \nof ideas, belief systems and institutional contexts within which the ISAs had been \ndeveloped, and through which they had been propagated in the first place. For Moskva-\nAudit\u2019s management, this meant it had to create further linkages to the international \nworld, through international co-operation, the achievement of external accreditation and \nother internationally oriented activities. \nTo achieve this, amongst other things, Moskva-Audit founded in 1997 the \u201cDepartment \nfor international audit activities\u201d. For the running of the international audit department, \npeople were hired who were fluent in English, had been trained in the West or had been \nenrolled in internationally recognised training programmes which were offered locally, \nfor example by associations such as the ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified \nAccountants). A defining feature of the Department became its international accounting \nexpertise. People had been taken on board who had had experience with the application \nof International Accounting Standards (IAS), American Generally Accepted Accounting \nPrinciples (US-GAAP) and British Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK-\nGAAP). One of the main services that the Department began to offer consisted in \nreconciliations of Russian financial statements with US-GAAP or IAS. In addition, \nmembers of the international audit department gave presentations at internationally \noriented accounting and audit conferences and established close connections with the \nInternational Centre of Accounting Reform (ICAR) in Moscow, a Western agency \nwhich had been set up to further the reform of accounting and auditing in Russia.30 \nMembers of Moskva-Audit\u2019s international audit department regularly wrote articles for \nICAR\u2019s accounting newsletter and participated in ICAR\u2019s project of creating an IFAC-\nendorsed Russian translation of international auditing standards (IFAC, 2000). \n                                                 \n30\n ICAR had been set up in 1998 by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Investment Advisory Council and the British Department \nfor International Development in cooperation with the Russian Institute of Professional Accountants to \nprovide guidance to the Russian government and other entities concerned with the transition towards \ninternational accounting and auditing standards. \n  33 \nWith the newly acquired, internationally oriented accounting expertise, the aggressive \nmarketing of it and its relations with ICAR, Moskva-Audit became able to participate \nsuccessfully in bids for audit assignments from international agencies, such as the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, World Bank and the subsidiaries \nof Western multinationals. In addition, it became actively involved in the conduct of \nTacis-funded31 accounting and audit reform projects, usually jointly run by local and \ninternational audit firms. Initially, these involvements did not bring much revenue, due \nto their small size and number, but they were considered to be very prestigious and, \nhence, important for the further development of Moskva-Audit\u2019s international \nreputation. Through these audit assignments and its active participation in accounting \nand audit reform projects, Moskva-Audit managed to build more direct contacts with \nthe international, western audit world and made itself widely known amongst Western \nagencies and organisations operating in Moscow. \nBut the new international audit department did not replace Moskva-Audit\u2019s old \n\u201cRussian\u201d audit department. Rather, a new world began to be created next to the old. \nWith more than 150 members, Moskva-Audit\u2019s old \u201cgeneral\u201d [obshy]32 audit \ndepartment, which had been founded in 1991, continued to be the firm\u2019s largest \ndepartment, whereas the new international audit department, which had started off \nworking with seven people, expanded only to about a dozen members. With the \nfoundation of the international audit department, Moskva-Audit\u2019s audit practice began \nto become divided, as did the use of the firm\u2019s internal methodological guidelines and \ncompliance codes. Both departments made reference to international auditing standards \nand they used the same internal methodological guidelines, indexing systems and \ncompliance codes, although they did this in very different ways. The auditing activities \nbecame split into \u201cRussian\u201d and \u201cinternational\u201d audits [russkiye i mezhdunarodnye \naudity]. Moskva-Audit\u2019s old audit department continued to carry out the so-called \nRussian audits. These were highly formalised and standardised audits which were \n                                                 \n31\n The Tacis-Programme Initiative was launched by the European Commission in 1991. Through the \nTacis Programme, the EU seeks to provide grant-financed technical assistance to countries of Eastern \nEurope and Central Asia. The Tacis Programme provides support for projects of institutional, legal and \nadministrative reform. As a rule, Tacis-funded projects have to be carried out in consortiums with at least \none local project partner. Between 1991 and 1997 and 1999 and 2005, the EU had launched ten different \nTacis-funded accounting and audit reform projects in Russia. \n32\n In Russia, a distinction is made between general and specialised audits. Specialised audits are statutory \naudits carried out in specific service sectors, such as the banking and insurance industries. General audits \nare statutory audits carried out in all other sectors and not subject to sector-specific regulations. Moskva-\nAudit\u2019s general audit department was responsible for the conduct of general audits. More specialised \naudits, such as bank audits, were carried out in other divisions. \n  34 \noverseen by the Ministry of Finance and primarily aimed at the checks of compliance \nwith national tax and accounting regulations. Much emphasis was placed on formal \naccuracy and detailed transaction testing. The ways in which materiality levels were \ncalculated and audit programmes designed were highly standardised and the quality \ncontrol department checked meticulously whether auditors\u2019 working papers complied \nwith the firm\u2019s indexing system, guidelines and methodologies. \nIn contrast, the international audit department became responsible for the conduct of so-\ncalled international audits. Here, \u201cworking according to international standards\u201d became \nlinked to the application of Western accounting principles (e.g. IAS or US-GAAP) and \nthe conduct of audits that were not subjected to any specific national regulatory \nauthority. More emphasis was placed on individual expertise and judgement, than on \nthe following of detailed rules. Because the auditors were operating outside the realm of \nRussian law, they had more freedom to decide what checks to carry out. As one senior \nRussian auditor with an ACCA qualification put it: \nYou have many requirements and instructions which you need to follow when carrying out \na Russian [statutory] audit. It is much easier to audit in accordance with international \nstandards. [\u2026] In a Russian audit you have to check the enterprise in accordance with \nvarious instructions, which are issued by the individual regulatory bodies. Checks that \nfollow these instructions take up much time. I just remember now, that we had to fill in all \nthose forms, which were quite long. Sometimes they were even 10 pages long. [\u2026] An \ninternational audit [i.e. an audit of financial statements prepared in accordance with a non-\nRussian accounting framework; A.M.] gives you more freedom and autonomy \n[samostoyatel\u2019nost\u2019]. \n(Interview No. 4, 2002) \nMoskva-Audit\u2019s international audit department used the firm\u2019s indexing system and \ncompliance codes as a starting point in structuring its work. But the department was \naccorded much more freedom by the internal quality control division in deciding on \nhow to follow the internal rules. Much less standardisation was required in the \npreparation of working papers, and auditors had much more freedom in deciding where \nthe main focus of the audit should lie. The audit quality control department adopted a \n\u201ccomply or explain\u201d approach when checking the audit files from the international audit \ndivision. Deviations from the indexing system and compliance codes were allowed, if \nthe auditors noted down reasons for these in their working papers. \nBetween 1997 and 2002, the old audit department continued to be Moskva-Audit\u2019s main \nbreadwinner and pillar in the Russian audit world, but the new international department \n  35 \nwas central for Moskva-Audit\u2019s international presentation. It made it possible to build \nup an international client base and become more directly exposed to Western accounting \nand audit expertise. Although the department remained small in terms of number of \nemployees, it became an important window and point of contact to the West. \nIn 2000, Moskva-Audit\u2019s international efforts culminated in the official accreditation of \nits international audit department by the World Bank. Apart from Moskva-Audit, only \nseven other Russian audit firms managed to become officially accredited by the World \nBank as World Bank auditors. The accreditation was based on a survey that World Bank \nemployees carried out in more than 50 Russian audit firms during July 2000. The \nsurvey\u2019s aim was to test to what degree the firms complied with international standards. \nThe survey was carried out on the basis of an inspection of the firms\u2019 audit files. \nSpecific attention was devoted to the documentation of work processes, internal quality \ncontrol procedures, adherence to independence requirements and the composition of \naudit programmes. Further, the employees\u2019 knowledge of international and US-\nAmerican accounting standards was tested. Out of the fifty firms tested, only eleven \nfirms, including the then Big Five accounting firms, were considered to comply with \ninternational standards. For Moskva-Audit, the results of the survey were of great \nimportance, as accreditation by the World Bank added enormously to the firm\u2019s \ninternational credibility, and helped to consolidate Moskva-Audit\u2019s network of \ninternational support. \nBut this was still not enough. To become part of the globally operating audit world, \nMoskva-Audit had to find additional allies. Its ISA-compliant audits were still not \nmarketable on a worldwide scale. On international stock exchanges, a firm like Moskva-\nAudit was not able to compete against the kind of resources and reputation that the large \nmultinational audit firms had. International capital markets distinguish between audits \ncarried out by small and medium-sized local firms, such as Moskva-Audit, and audits \ncarried out by large multinational audit firms \u2013 such as PwC, KPMG, Ernst and Young, \nDeloitte \u2013 or second tier firms such as BDO, Grant Thornton and PKF (see e.g. Teoh & \nWong, 1993). As the study by Wolk, Michelson and Wootton (2001) shows, by 1999 \nsmaller accounting firms had virtually been eliminated from the NYSE market, and over \n98% of the companies listed on the NYSE had been audited by the then Big Five \naccounting firms. Beattie, Goodacre and Fearnley (2003) draw a similar picture for the \nUK. That is, the Big Five firms audited 82.6 per cent of all companies listed in the UK, \n  36 \n100 per cent of the FTSE 100 firms, and 97.8 per cent of the FTSE 250 firms in 2002 \n(Beattie, Goodacre & Fearnley, 2003, p. 257). \nAfter having explored various ways of showing itself to be \u2018western\u2019 or \u2018international\u2019, \nMoskva-Audit\u2019s management decided in 2001 to apply for membership in one of the \nlarge international audit networks.33 At that time, most of Moskva-Audit\u2019s Russian \ncounterparts had already joined one of these international audit networks and, as \nGendron et al. (2007: 105) would put it, anchored their claims to expertise through their \nmembership of one of these. For most of these firms, membership of these networks had \nopened up significant new international business opportunities. Seeing this, Moskva-\nAudit now sought to do the same. In choosing a possible network partner, Moskva-\nAudit was looking for a network whose brand name was already internationally well \nknown and established. For the firm, it was important that the network would be of \nconsiderable size, with an interesting portfolio of large multinational clients and good \nconnections to the international regulatory scene (e.g. through membership in IFAC's\u2019 \n\u201cForum of Firms\u201d).34 To attract the attention of such an audit network, Moskva-Audit \nhired a marketing manager with international experience and education (MBA) to \npresent and \u201csell\u201d Moskva-Audit\u2019s international orientation, its work force, \nmethodological rigour, contributions to local audit reform initiatives and wide-ranging \nRussian client-network. Following a series of meetings, talks and negotiations, in 2002, \nMoskva-Audit managed to become fully incorporated into one of the largest \ninternational audit networks. Soon after joining the network, Moskva-Audit changed its \nname to that of the network. It became part of the network\u2019s brand and, thereby, \nsignificantly enhanced its position within the international division of audit labour.35 \nThe Director and founder of Moskva-Audit commented on what membership of the \nnetwork meant: \nOur accession to the international audit network marks a new stage in the development of \nour company. We have always emphasised our commitment to national business and \n                                                 \n33\n Examples of such globally operating audit networks are: BDO International, Grant Thornton and PKF \nInternational. These networks form the world\u2019s second tier of large audit firms after the Big Four. \n34\n The Forum of Firms (FOF) was launched in January 2001 \"to bring together firms which perform \ntransnational audits and involve them more closely with IFAC\u2019s activities in audit and other assurance-\nrelated areas\" (FOF Constitution, p. 3). The FOF conducts its business primarily through the \nTransnational Auditors Committee, an IFAC committee whose members have been nominated by the \nmembers of the Forum. \n35\n Moskva-Audit was not a unique case. By the end of 2003, most large Russian accounting firms had \nbeen integrated into international audit firm networks. Examples of such firms are: FBK, who became a \nmember of the PKF network; UNICON, who became part of the BDO group and Russaudit, who became \na member of Baker Tilly International. \n  37 \npriorities, but we have never hidden our aspiration to gain access to the world community \nand expand the stage of our professional activity by adding an international dimension to it. \nNow we have attained this goal. [\u2026] With the integration into the international network we \ncan efficiently assist our clients in their entry to the world capital markets, IPOs or \nfundraising from Western financial institutions. [\u2026] Until recently, international audit was \nthe exclusive domain of the Big Four. Now we can make it possible for our clients to have \ntheir IAS-compliant financial statements certified with a \u201cstamp\u201d of an internationally \nrecognised auditor.36 \nMoskva-Audit\u2019s incorporation into the international network provided the firm with \ngreater chances of being seen and identified as a firm that is able to provide work in \naccordance with international standards. Inter alia, the membership enabled Moskva-\nAudit to register with the US-American Public Company Oversight Board (PCAOB) \nand to carry out audits for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Thereby, \nthe firm could not only strengthen its international connections, but also further extend \nits already strong position in the local Russian audit market. Ultimately, Moskva-\nAudit\u2019s director became a member of the network\u2019s international council, which \nallowed the firm, for the first time, to explicitly exert influence at an international level, \nrather than just react to Western directives and standards. \nWhat had made it possible for Moskva-Audit to join the network? Working with \ninternational standards had been a necessary, but by no means sufficient condition. \nWhat had attracted the network's attention was not only related to Moskva-Audit's \nadoption of international standards. It was also linked to the general reputation that the \nfirm had managed to build up in the Russian audit market, the recognition it had gained \nfrom the Russian World Bank office, the co-operation with ICAR, and its contributions \nto local accounting and audit reform projects. In addition, Moskva-Audit had a portfolio \nof interesting Russian clients, which it could bring into the network, and good relations \nwith national regulatory institutions.37 Thus, joining the network and becoming defined \nas \u201cworking in accordance to standards\u201d had required much more than investments in \nform, organisational structure and audit methodology. It had also involved hard \nrepresentational work, the establishment and cultivation of public relations, the \nmanagement of diverse expectations, and the formation and maintenance of a balanced \nnetwork of different local and non-local allies. And with the joining of the international \n                                                 \n36\n The quote was taken from Moskva-Audit\u2019s website in November 2003. For reasons of confidentiality, \nwebsite details cannot be disclosed. \n37\n Members of Moskva-Audit, for example, were actively involved in the work of the Audit Expert \nCouncil, which had been set up by the Ministry of Finance to further the cooperation between \ngovernment, audit firms and professional associations. \n  38 \naudit network, finally, Moskva-Audit had begun the process of connecting the multiple \nand diverse \u2018worlds\u2019 of international auditing standards. \nDiscussion and Conclusion \nTo make an audit compliant with international standards means satisfying multiple \nconditions. It depends on much more than \u2018proper\u2019 technical implementation. It is \nequally linked to a firm\u2019s position within hierarchies of credibility, and its ability to \ngenerate acceptance across many different frames of reference, regulatory contexts, \npolitical programmes and economic circumstances. For Moskva-Audit, the decisive step \nin becoming recognised as working in accordance with international standards was the \njoining of a large international audit network, and the re-naming of the firm to that of \nthe network. The ISAs turned out to be of lower value than the names of the \ninternational audit groups. The legitimating and marketing potential of ISAs had \nbecome closely linked to the names and ranks of already established, large western audit \nfirms. The application of international audit standards on their own did not have the \ncapacity to constitute an international audit. International auditing expertise had become \nthe territory of the big international firms, and international auditing standards had been \nturned into an exclusive label for them. \nIn a way, the ISAs had come to lead a double existence. On the one hand, the standards \nhad been propagated as a universally applicable, civilising measure. They had become \nimplicated in dreams of auditing as a uniform set of procedures, and desires to create an \ninternationally homogeneous whole. In particular, regulatory authorities and multilateral \norganisations, such as the World Bank, the OECD and IFAC, had promoted the \nstandards as a means of increasing the quality, uniformity and international \ncomparability of audit practice. As a consequence, especially for developing and \ntransitional economies seeking trans-national investment and political acceptance, \nadherence to international standards came to be seen as a crucial factor for the \nestablishment of international recognition and legitimacy. The ISAs became regarded as \nan entry point for modernisation and achieving equivalence. Underlying their spread \nhad been universalising and homogenising semantics of the inclusion of everyone \n(Meyer, Boli, Thomas & Ramirez, 1997). \nOn the other hand, the standards had come to acquire global authority only in a very \nspecific realm. The ISAs had been incorporated in a hierarchy of credibility led by the \n  39 \nlarge, globally operating audit networks. The standards had become involved in \nstrategies of the big international firms seeking to stabilise and protect their \noccupational monopoly, for example, with respect to services provided to companies \nlisted on Western stock exchanges, such as the New York or London Stock Exchange. \nThese firms had used the rules to reaffirm their leading market position and \ncredentialise their audit practice. The universality of the standards had become confined \nto a specific locus. Ideals of audit universalism and international standardisation had \nbecome attached to a particular group of audit firms and their activities. Dreams of \nsameness had become enmeshed in problems and practices of exclusion. What \nstandardisers in post-Soviet Russia had considered to be modern was seen as outdated in \nthe West. The politics of international entrepreneurial networks, to a large extent, had \ncome to determine the legitimising and connecting potential of the standards. \nAlso in the case of Moskva-Audit, adopting the brand name of an international audit \nnetwork had led to higher international institutional recognition than the organisational \nincorporation of the standards. To become modern in Western terms, the management \nof the audit firm had to establish an explicitly internationally oriented audit department \nwith a new generation of auditors holding Western accounting qualifications and \npossessing knowledge of Western accounting rules. The international auditing \ndepartment provided Moskva-Audit with the possibility of creating small, confined \npockets of reform, which the firm could use to reach out to the West and develop a \nnetwork of international support which, finally, led to its membership of the \ninternational network. \nBut Moskva-Audit\u2019s integration into the global audit network did not lead to a complete \ndissolution of local differences. On the contrary, the brand name of the international \naudit network had made it possible for Moskva-Audit to achieve both, to become \ndefined as working in accordance with international standards by the West whilst \nmaintaining at least some of its local specificity. Divisions between its Russian audit \ndepartment serving the Russian audit market and its international auditing department \nserving international markets, for example, continued to exist \u2013 at least up to the point \nwhen this paper was written. The joining of the network had made it possible for \nMoskva-Audit, and the ISAs respectively, to continue to inhabit multiple contexts and \naudit cultures, old and new, local and global, Western and post-Soviet worlds of audit \nactivity. With the name of the global audit network local differences had become \n  40 \nlegitimate and, moreover, internationally marketable. Joining the international audit \nnetwork had been important for Moskva-Audit, as it allowed the firm to join the \u201cworld \ncommunity\u201d of audit firms. Thereby, the firm could significantly enhance its \ninternational reputation, open up new business opportunities and get closer to the \nmethodologies of internationally established audit expertise. But equally Moskva-Audit \nconstituted a strategically important partner for the network. Through Moskva-Audit\u2019s \nmembership, the network became able to create closer linkages with the Russian audit \nworld, delineate new spheres of audit activity and expand its global business territory. \nThe \u201cconnecting\u201d of worlds is the process of forming such multiple linkages, including \nthe various detours and experiments that Moskva-Audit had to undertake before it could \nfinally stabilise its connections \u2013 at least for a while. \nIn the long run, Moskva-Audit\u2019s integration into the global audit network may stimulate \nthe harmonisation of its audit approaches with those of the other member firms of the \nnetwork. But it is very unlikely that this will lead to the reproduction of a monolithic \nand unitary \u2018Western\u2019 audit culture. As the study by Barrett, Cooper and Jamal (2005) \nhas shown, the homologies that international auditing standards help to produce, for \nexample in areas of audit methodologies and process structures, are always \naccompanied by difference, even at the level of large international audit networks. \nThese differences, inter alia, arise out of the locally specific accounting frameworks, \neconomic interests, political contexts and regulatory cultures within which the auditors \nand their clients are operating. \nFrom this it follows that processes of audit standardisation can hardly be closed or \nfinalised. International auditing standards do not have a clearly bounded existence. \nProcesses of international audit standardisation oscillate between sameness and \ndifference, universalism and particularism. They move back and forth between ideas of \ncross-national comparability and contexts of local specificity. To paraphrase Brunsson \n(2000), we have to be careful not to conflate standardisation and uniformity. The value \nand applicability of ISAs can be strategically renegotiated by those who claim to work \nwith them, or who try to regulate auditing in accordance with them. Although the \nadoption of ISAs is often motivated by attempts to imagine and create auditing as a \nuniform, internationally homogeneous whole, differences between the local and non-\nlocal, between the big international and the smaller indigenous audit firms, can never be \ncompletely erased. Ideals of audit universalism and international comparability become \n  41 \nenmeshed in, and challenged by, global divisions of audit labour, problems and \npractices of power and exclusion, and struggles for intra-professional distinction, which \nin turn promote as well as undermine the connecting of worlds through standards. \nInternational auditing standards constitute a pervasive, but by no means unequivocal \nreference point. The firm we investigated tried to stabilise and concretise international \nauditing standards, initially through the establishment of machine-like internal rule \nsystems and work processes. Although these rule systems, to some extent, resembled \nthose of large international firms, their creation was not enough to enhance Moskva-\nAudit\u2019s international acceptance. The attractiveness that the standards came to enjoy \nwas rooted in beliefs that they could be used as a connecting device to become accepted \nby, and integrated into, Western world of audit business. But the integrative power of \nthe standards was undermined by existing divisions of audit labour, processes of intra-\nprofessional differentiation, and discrepancies between different local accounting and \naccountability cultures. International auditing standards stimulated the production of \nuniform representations of audit work, for example with respect to written audit reports, \nworking papers and audit files. But this uniformity alone did not lead to greater \nacceptance and international integration. \nHence, one needs to be careful to distinguish between standard forms of carrying out a \nprocess and standards as an abstract concept, a goal or benchmark which actors aspire \nto. In the case of Moskva-Audit, international auditing standards were translated into \nstandard forms of carrying out audit processes, but this did not result in the transmission \nof uniform, clearly identifiable audit ideas. International Standards on Auditing might \nhave the capability to produce harmony in form, but they are still far from being able to \nincrease convergence with respect to professional approaches, programmes and ethical \nattitudes to actual audit work. Whether or not international auditing standards arrive at a \ncertain place, and whether or not they are \u201csuccessfully\u201d translated, is always prone to \ndebate. ISAs evoke ideas of similarity and compatibility, but they do not constitute a \nuniversal yardstick against which auditing practices can be easily measured or \ncompared. What standardisation means is constantly remade and traversed. Although \ninternational auditing standards make reference to concrete audit techniques, for \nexample with respect to sampling or testing procedures, they do not entail very precise \ndefinitions of the objectives and outcomes of an audit. \n  42 \nAs this paper has shown, the ambiguity of the standards is both their strength and their \nweakness. To be connectable to a variety of different situations, worlds, dreams and \nideals, ISAs necessarily have to maintain a level of abstraction that can only be made \nconcrete by the users themselves. The text of the standards is formulated in an abstract \nmanner, so that it can embrace a variety of meanings and interpretations and, thereby, \nmake the standards attractive to a wide range of people and institutions. On the other \nhand, the vagueness of the ISAs makes it difficult to hold them in place. International \naudit standardisation agendas are implicated in a range of heterogeneous interests, \nmechanisms and instruments which can undermine their interconnecting and reform-\nengendering function. Hence, rather than assuming that ISAs function as carriers of \n\u201cbest practice\u201d, this paper draws attention to the open and fragile nature of processes of \ntranslation and standardisation. It shows how the standards became embedded in, and \nwere made to mediate between, multiple arenas of audit action and representation. \nStudying the micro-processes of audit standardisation in post-Soviet Russia can help \ndirect our attention to important issues and problems connected with the promulgation \nof Western audit models and standards and how these depend on multiple processes of \n\u201cconnecting worlds\u201d. \n  43 \nAcknowledgements \nThis study was financially supported by the Department of Accounting and Finance at \nLSE, the Centre for Analysis of Risk and Regulation (CARR, also based at LSE), the \nBritish Economic and Social Research Council (Award No. R42200034280) and a \nfellowship from the Clifford Barclay Scholarship Fund.
