Respondents reported improved health behaviours \n(specifically better diets and increased exercise); positive psychosocial outcomes (including \nincreased self-esteem, confidence and social support) and in some cases return to work. However, \nconcerns were expressed about the shortness of interventions and their accessibility \n \nConclusion \nAlthough condition management appears to have been well-received by participants, the findings also \nillustrate that there is no \u201eone size fits all\u201f template for CMPs.  Rather, interventions should be \nadapted to take account of the dynamics of specific conditions, the context in which the intervention is \nbased and the characteristics of the individuals involved. \n \nAbstract word count: 198 \n \nKey words: psychosocial; rehabilitation; employment; welfare; fitness for work; qualitative evaluation  \n \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \nLong term sickness absence is a significant problem in the UK, in terms of the certification demands \nplaced on GPs, labour market participation rates, social exclusion, and social security costs (there \nwere 2.7 million people claiming Incapacity Benefit (IB) at a cost of approximately \u00a312.5 billion per \nannum in 2006\/07).1,2  Stark inequalities in the number of incapacity benefit claimants exist across the \nUK, with the greatest proportion of claimants being found in former industrial areas particularly in the \nNorth3 such as County Durham.  Return to work and work retention for people with a chronic illness is \ntherefore a pressing policy issue and various employability interventions and benefit reforms that aim \nto help tackle this issue have been initiated in the last few years.  Most of these have focused on the \nemployability side of the problem, with only Condition Management Programmes (CMPs) addressing \nthe issue of long-term sickness absence from a health perspective. \n \nPilot CMPs were introduced in 2003 as part of the Choices package of the Pathways to Work pilots.4  \nPathways to Work became a national programme in 20085.  Pathways to Work was introduced to \nhelp operationalise the Labour government\u201fs desire to get 1 million people off Incapacity Benefit and \nback to work. It is targeted at new Incapacity Benefit claimants but the initiative is also available to \nexisting claimants on a voluntary basis (2.6 million people)6.  CMPs are joint initiatives between \nJobcentre Plus and local NHS providers,7 targeting the three chronic conditions which contribute \nmost to IB claims: mental ill-health; cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal conditions.4   \n \nThe programmes adopt a biopsychosocial approach, focusing on the psychological and social factors \nrelating to ill-health (e.g. anxiety, low self-esteem and social isolation) as well as the medical \naspects.8 The aims of CMPs are threefold: (i) to improve coping skills to enable  individuals to \nmanage their own health conditions; (ii) to enhance quality of life; and (iii) to improve employability.9,10  \nAs Lindsay, McQuaid and Dutton (2007, p.556) note coping skills \u201ccan be the crucial element in a \nprocess of personal development towards a return to work\u201d.11  A recent review by Dame Carol \n 3 \nBlack12 highlighted the important role GPs can play in managing sickness absence and, although \nCMPs tend to be delivered by allied health professionals, there are opportunities for GPs to be \ninvolved in championing the programmes and supporting patients during the return to work process.  \nThe importance of CMPs in the UK is increasing due to the replacement of Incapacity Benefit with \nEmployment Support Allowance (ESA).  The new two tiered system involves the ESA payable at the \nsame rate as Job Seekers Allowance and an Additional Support Allowance for those judged \nincapable of working by a medically administered test.13  Individuals deemed sick but fit to work must \nparticipate in some form of work related activity such as Pathways to Work (which incorporates \nCMPs) in order to receive additional support.  For a more detailed discussion of the implications \narising from the introduction of ESA see Bambra 200814.   \n \nCMPs have been evaluated nationally4,7,10,15 but mostly in terms of their employment effects. Those \nevaluations that have been conducted have mainly considered the views and experiences of CMP \npractitioners or IB Personal Advisers4,10,15 and there is little research into patients\u201f experiences of \nCMP.7  The evidence base in relation to CMP for mental health conditions is particularly limited, \nwhich should be of concern, given the large numbers of patients with mental health conditions on \nIB.16  This small scale qualitative study is therefore the first to examine patients\u201f experiences of the \nCMP in terms of health impacts (lifestyle\/behavioural changes and pain management) and \npsychosocial wellbeing, as well as employability. Taking experiences from five CMPs in one locality \n(County Durham), it thereby provides an in-depth evaluation of this prominent, primary care based, \nreturn to work intervention.  While various models of CMP provision have been adopted in different \nareas nationally, the CMPs evaluated in the Durham locality have been largely implemented on a \n\u201eone size fits all\u201f basis, with policymakers assuming that the format of weekly group sessions over a \nspecified time period (6 or 12 weeks), with little opportunity for follow-up support (see Box 1), would \nbe appropriate for all of the CMPs.  Here we use qualitative methods to explore patients\u201f views and \nsituated experiences of CMPs in terms of health, wellbeing and employability.  Rather than \n 4 \nconcentrating on the effectiveness of CMPs as defined by return to work rates, this study provides \nimportant insights into the meanings patients attached to CMPs; in other words what they perceived \nwas useful and what was problematic or limiting about the programmes in terms of their impacts on \nhealth and wellbeing as well as on employability.  Experiences of participants involved in the following \nCMPs were explored: Cardiac Rehabilitation; Counselling; Lower Back Pain Services; Smoking \nCessation and a GP Exercise Referral Programme. \n \nBox 1: Study context -  County Durham \n \nMethodology \nPatients\u201f experiences of the CMPs were explored using a combination of focus groups (n=4) and \nsemi-structured interviews (n=9).  Focus groups were identified as the method of choice in order to \ncapture the views, opinions and experiences of a range of individuals participating in the Cardiac \nRehabilitation; Lower Back Pain Services, Smoking Cessation and GP referral for exercise \nprogrammes.18  However, in the case of the Counselling Service, it was deemed more appropriate by \nthe researchers and the project co-ordinators to conduct interviews (n=6) individually (either face-to-\nface or by telephone, depending on the participants\u201f preferences), given the nature of the intervention \nand the sensitivity of the issues involved.  Three additional case study interviews were also \nconducted for the Cardiac Rehabilitation; Lower Back Pain Services and Smoking Cessation \nprogrammes.  In total 25 participants were involved in the study. \n \nA thematic topic guide (see Box 2) was devised for the focus groups and adapted for the semi-\nstructured interviews.  This was informed by the existing literature-base relating to return-to-work \nschemes and by the previous experiences of the research team.  Participants were recruited through \nthe intervention leaders who adopted a \u201egatekeeping\u201f role.  Although briefed to recruit participants \noffering a broad range of views, it must be acknowledged that these gatekeepers may have \u2013 either \n 5 \nwittingly or unwittingly \u2013 recruited individuals who most regularly attended the CMPs and who were \ntherefore most engaged with the programmes.  As a result, these individuals may have been more \nlikely to offer positive responses than other participants.  However, the fact that many of the research \nparticipants offered criticisms of the interventions and that several focus group participants claimed \nsome CMP participants had been unable to attend the focus group because they had already \nreturned to work, suggests that this was not necessarily the case. \n \nWith the exception of the smoking cessation programme (where the intervention was delivered in the \nworkplace) all interviews and focus groups took place at the venue where the CMP had been \ndelivered and were audio recorded, after the consent of participants had been obtained.  It is possible \nthat by using the venue where the CMPs took place to conduct the focus groups and interviews \nparticipants may have felt inhibited and unable to express their honest opinions of the CMPs.  \nHowever we did explain to participants that the feedback they provided would be anonymised and  \nwe did not find any evidence to suggest this may be occurring.  The possibility of self-censoring is \ncommon in focus groups, where individuals may refrain from making contributions due to the nature \nof the group context or the environment in which the focus group is conducted18.   \n \nFocus groups varied in length, lasting between 30 and 60 minutes (with an average of 49 minutes) \nand involved between four and six participants.  Two members of the research team were present at \neach of the focus groups, with one leading the discussion and the other taking field notes and \nchecking that all of the topic guide themes had been addressed.  One-to-one interviews for the \ncounselling CMP ranged from 15-53 minutes (with an average of 26 minutes) and were conducted \nface-to-face by KJ (n=3) or by telephone KJ and by KS (n=3).  The research was approved in \nadvance by [name removed for anonymity] University Ethics Committee.  \n \n 6 \nAudio data were transcribed verbatim and fully anonymised before thematic analysis was undertaken \nby two experienced qualitative researchers working in collaboration.  A framework for analysis was \nderived abductively, partly from the study objectives and partly by exploring the data and identifying \nthemes and sub themes from interim analysis of transcripts.19   This process of analysis was \nfacilitated using the qualitative analysis software package Atlas Ti (Version 5.0.66, Atlas Ti Scientific \nSoftware Development GmbH, Berlin) and the emergent themes were checked for consistency \nbetween authors.  Researcher interpretations and emergent themes were then discussed by the \nresearch team as a whole, in order to help resolve any discrepancies.  Extracts from interview and \nfocus group discussions are presented in the following section, which aims to draw out the most \nsalient themes from the analyses.  The acronym accompanying each quotation refers to the CMP \nbeing discussed (see Box 1).  Demographic information of focus group and interview participants are \nincluded in Table 1.  Participants included patients on short and long term sickness absence \n(Incapacity Benefit) as well as individuals who were in work and used the programmes to manage \ntheir condition to prevent movement out of the labour market. \n \nTable 1: Demographic information of study participants \nBox 2: Research Topic Guide \n \nFindings \nThematic analyses uncovered a range of overlapping themes in the data, which are set out in Figure \n1.  Health experiences were defined in terms of changes to lifestyle and behaviour and pain \nmanagement capabilities; this included impacts relating to improved mobility, increased frequency of \nexercising and the development of coping strategies.  In terms of psychosocial experiences (relating \nto feelings of wellbeing), respondents described a number of outcomes, including increased \nconfidence and self-esteem, as well as the development of a more positive attitude to rehabilitation or \ncondition management.  Some participants also described positive experiences in relation to \n 7 \nemployability, including retaining employment, moving back into employment after a period of \nsickness absence, and\/or increased aspirations regarding the labour market.  The complex and \noverlapping nature of the perceived impacts of the programmes is highlighted in Figure 1, where, for \nexample, changes with respect to employability such as return-to-work after sickness absence are \ncontingent upon psychosocial outcomes like increased confidence or lifestyle impacts such as \ndecreased reliance on medication.  It should be noted, however, that both focus group and interview \nparticipants expressed a number of concerns about the structure and delivery of the interventions \n(such as a lack of follow-up and difficulties in accessing services), which have the potential to limit the \npositive impacts of the programmes (see Figure 1).     \n \nFigure 1: Key themes to emerge from the analysis \n \nHealth related experiences  \nSeveral respondents suggested that taking part in a CMP had brought about significant changes in \ntheir day-to-day lives in terms of diet and exercise regimes: \n\u2018I changed my diet from the day when I got told what the fault was.  I was fourteen \nstone then before I went for the operation.  I went down to twelve.  That was in three \nmonths.  Basically, what I had when I was there was none of the fried stuff, bacon, \nsausages, no pies, no cakes, no biscuits, no fish and chips, and just apples and \noranges\u2026 I don\u2019t even eat salt now.\u2019 (CR) \n \n\u2018I'm more agile now than I was before I came. I am, I'm definitely more agile.\u2019 (GPR) \n \nChanges in lifestyle-behavioural parameters such as improved fitness and mobility were attributed to \nthe delivery of advice and information regarding exercise and fitness, as well as to new coping \nstrategies for pain management, as reflected below: \n\u2018It wasn\u2019t only that you were learning, it\u2019s your lifestyle, like walking, exercise like.  \nThey said do the exercise, it helps to keep the fat down as well.  You don\u2019t do \nexercise just to build your muscles, and keep your build fitter.  But it actually improves \nyour lifestyle.\u2019 (CR) \n \n 8 \n\u2018I\u2019ve not been removed from the situation that brought about that level of distress in \nme, but I recognise that I cope so much better that I am so much better at being able \nto challenge individuals, as the situation comes up.\u2019 (C) \n \nAs the above quotations indicate, for people with long term conditions, aspects of the interventions \nrelating to coping mechanisms and exercising were felt to be particularly helpful.  This suggests that \nthe biopsychosocial approach adopted by the Lower Back Pain and Cardiac Rehabilitation \nprogrammes, which incorporated elements of education and relaxation as well as a comprehensive \nexercise regime, was well conceived.   \n \nPsychosocial experiences  \nIt was clear from all five focus group\/interview discussions that the CMPs also had a range of \nimportant psychosocial benefits for participants.  Participants across all interventions reported feeling \nmore positive about their general health and wellbeing after taking part in the interventions:   \n\u2018I used to come out of here after the three and half hours, whatever it was, feeling \nreally great.  Feeling positive and feeling good.\u2019 (LBP) \n \n\u2018And it\u2019s mental, it is, it\u2019s all in your head and I think you\u2019ve got to try.  Like I said, the \nwhole time you\u2019re going through it.  It\u2019s the same with your thoughts, and I have to \nliterally turn negativity round to positiveness now.\u2019 (SC) \n \nSimilarly, many participants reported that one of the central benefits of their involvement in the \nintervention had been an increase in feelings of self-confidence and self-esteem.  As the extract \nbelow illustrates, some participants discussed how participation in the CMPs contributed positively to \ntheir mental health:  \n\u2018I think mentally it helps.\u2026[I] can get a bit depressed and I think coming out into an \nenvironment like this tends to stimulate you more, mentally as well as physically.\u2019 \n(GPR) \n \nOther participants emphasised how increases in their sense of confidence helped them in more \npractical ways, by, for example, helping them feel more able to remain at work, as the following \nquotation illustrates:    \n 9 \n\u2018I can manage my back pain better, [it] makes me more confident, and obviously, as a \nresult of that, I'm not taking time off work.  So in that sense it was a good investment.\u2019 \n(LBP) \n \nAnother salient theme highlighted in each of the focus group discussions was the opportunities that \nthe interventions provided for social interaction with other participants (and staff).  This appeared to \nhave provided a level of stimulation, support and motivation that many of the participants felt they \nwould not have experienced if they had received the intervention on a one-to-one basis:   \n\u2018And we\u2019ve all like watched ourselves.  We\u2019ve had a laugh, haven\u2019t we?  You have to \nhave a laugh, you have to carry on.\u2019 (CR) \n \n\u2018And I think the group thing that works doesn\u2019t it, because you get together and you \nrealise that other people are having the same problems.\u2019 (LBP) \n \n\u2018I found here being in company, it's a lot more [\u2026] better, nice people and I thought I could do \nit better. I've more incentive to do things I think.\u2019 (GPR) \n \nParticipants described how they benefited from developing social support networks built on shared \nexperiences of similar problems:   \n \n\u2018You think you\u2019re the only one, and then you see somebody else\u2019s problems.\u2019 (CR) \n \n\u2018And I found the whole process valuable, particularly going along with other people \nwho had similar problems and sharing their problems with them.  I must admit I was \nrather cynical at first but I'm quite positive at the end of it.\u2019 (LBP) \n \nThrough identifying with others, participants often described having been able to adopt a more \npositive attitude to their condition and, accordingly, their approach to managing it. \n \nExperiences in relation to individuals\u2019 employability  \nThere were various accounts of the positive impact that these five projects had on employment \noutcomes.  Several participants from the Lower Back Pain, Counselling, and Cardiac Rehabilitation \nprogrammes described how the CMP had helped them to retain employment or return to work after a \nperiod of sickness absence.   \n \n 10 \n\u2018\u2018I've had no time off work since then [referring to participation in the intervention] so \ntouch wood.  Not that I had a lot of time.  I was similar to you [referring to other focus \ngroup participant].  When it\u2019s bad you think, \u2018well, when I can\u2019t get in the car I can\u2019t \ngo.\u2019 (LBP) \n \n\u2018I was off [work] for about three month - March to, I think it was June.  I went back, so \nI\u2019ve been back all the time since then, and I\u2019ve felt a lot better since I went back.\u2019 (C) \n \nThe reasons underpinning movement back to work put forward by participants in these three \nprogrammes included the development of new pain management and coping strategies, a more \npositive mental attitude to their condition, and the incorporation of physical exercise into daily routines \nas a means of increasing their fitness and mobility. Similarly, in the GP Referral focus group there \nwas some positive discussion about people who had been able to return to work as a result of the \ninitiative:  \n\u2018I know quite a lot of people that's used this. They work and find they've had a bad \nback and they've come and they've gone back to work.\u2019 (GPR) \n \n\u2018And you have access back to work. It is a good instrument to get people back to \nwork. It's excellent.\u2019 (GPR) \n \nFor some individuals who did not feel ready to return to work, there was at least a sense that their \ndesire (and in some instances, their confidence) to return to work in the longer term had been \nincreased through participation in a CMP. For example: \n\u2018He [the project facilitator] gave me the confidence.  I thought, right, the next few \nweeks I'm going to go back to work.  Then something else happened at home.  I \nthought, I wish I could see [name of counsellor] just to get it off my chest.  I thought, I \ncan\u2019t go back to work.  I should go back to work but inside me is pulling me back, I \ncan\u2019t.  I can\u2019t.\u2019 (C) \n \nThe above extract highlights the depth and complexity of the issues facing some participants and \nunderlines the need for joined-up and long-term approaches that can offer a range of support.  \n \nParticipants concerns regarding the CMPs \nHaving highlighted the varied benefits of CMPs that participants reported, it is important to also reflect \non some of the concerns that were raised.  One concern, which appeared to be important for \n 11 \nparticipants across all five CMPs, was the continuity (or otherwise) of interventions and the \nopportunities for longer-term support.  In this respect, there was significant variation both between \nwhat the various projects offered participants and also between the requirements of individuals with \ndifferent conditions.  For example, the opportunity for follow-up support was provided in both the \nCardiac Rehabilitation and Lower Back Pain programmes and this was something that seemed to be \nappreciated by participants and which they believed was likely to help them to cope with their \ncondition and to continue to benefit from what they had learned during the programme:   \n\u2018It would be a bit of a shame if say after twelve weeks it just stopped, and that\u2019s it, no \nmore\u2026 At least there is a follow-up system.\u2019 (CR)   \n \n\u2018Because if you feel you're not doing the exercises, and sometimes you do do things \nthat you think, is that right?  Whereas if you can come, you can do it again as a group \nand it refreshes what you're doing and how you're doing it.\u2019 (LBP) \n \nIn contrast, the Counselling and GP Referral programmes offered little in the way of a follow-up to the \nprogramme.  In several instances, the use of such short term programmes was felt by participants to \nbe unhelpful and they reported feeling that, whilst they had been actively encouraged to participate, \nthey had been left unsupported once the intervention ended: \n\u2018After the 12 weeks the only issue I'll probably have is, like I say, if I'm working, \n[inaudible] start working when do I come?  Because apparently you've got a cut off \ntime. And I find that probably a little bit unfair.\u2019 (GPR) \n \n\u2018You can\u2019t put a timescale on it can you?  Really, you\u2019re going to need support for \nyears.\u2019 (SC) \n \nThe above quotations also serve to highlight the problematic issue of dependency, whereby \nindividuals participating on the CMPs are unable to cope without the programme\u201fs support when the \nintervention ends.  For the Counselling intervention, more so than any of the other CMPs, the lack of \ncontinuity and follow-up appears to have been critical to participants.  Indeed, it could be argued that, \nbecause counselling services encourage individuals to reflect on what are often very personal and \nsensitive issues, to leave clients without the possibility of a follow-up after a six week period is \npotentially damaging, as the following interviewee reflected:   \n 12 \n\u2018After quite a few weeks of not seeing him [the counsellor], that I slipped back a \nbit\u2026.I probably need a long time for counselling\u2026.I feel I've gone back a little bit \ninstead of going forward, because he did give me confidence about myself, but now \nit\u2019s gone back.\u2019 (C) \n \nThese data suggest that the short-termism of some of the interventions raises important issues \nrelating both the efficacy and the ethics of short term CMPs that offer no follow-up.  It also appears to \nundermine the overarching objective of encouraging movement into employment.   \n \nThe absence of follow-up arrangements was not the only issue that clients of the Counselling service \nexpressed concerns about; several also reported that they found the process of having to access the \nservice via their GP both difficult and time consuming.  As the extract below indicates, some of the \ninterviewees felt that the referral process could be made more streamlined and efficient, and less \nmedicalised, especially in cases where individuals already recognised that they needed to access \ncounselling: \n\u2018So why has the middle link got to be a doctor?  Again, I agree with the fact that \nsomebody might not know that they have a problem, an issue, they require \ncounselling, but for learners and the educated people that do, there should be an \nalternative there, thinking, \u2018look I need help, I know it\u2019s very professional, I need \ncounselling, I can get in touch with a counsellor\u2019.  [Then] there\u2019s no need to go \nthrough the GP.\u2019 (C) \n \nAnother participant described her\/his frustrations in negotiating access to her\/his GP: \n\u201eI mean, as I say, I couldn\u2019t get through to my doctor.  I mean my doctor\u2019s lovely \nbut I just couldn\u2019t get past the receptionist.\u2019 (C) \n \nDifficulties in securing an appointment with a GP appeared to have further demoralised some already \nvulnerable individuals and, in some cases, this may have compounded existing problems.  To \ncircumvent this problem one participant suggested making counselling services available through \nother non-clinical routes, such as via a drop-in centre or helpline.   \n \nFinally, for those participants on the GP referral scheme, there was a feeling that the lack of flexibility \nin the timing of activities being run as part of this scheme may also have limited participation: \n 13 \n\u2018Most of them are in the mornings. Most of the \u2026 the GP referrals are mostly \nmornings aren't they?...I'd like to see a big change in the access there, I think\u2019. \n(GPR) \n \nThese concerns around access tended to be voiced by participants in the Counselling and GP \nReferral programmes specifically and were not expressed by participants in the other CMPs.  This \nraises the question of whether different access routes to CMPs should be considered in the design of \nfuture interventions. \n  \nDiscussion \nExperiences of the CMPs were generally positive.  Respondents reported: improved pain \nmanagement techniques; positive changes in health-related behaviours (specifically better diets and \nincreased exercise); a wide range of beneficial psychosocial outcomes (including increased self-\nesteem, confidence and social support) and in some cases a return to work after a period of sickness \nabsence.  The holistic, biopsychosocial approach to the programmes was considered to be \nparticularly helpful. This further suggests that the kinds of cross-cutting approaches supported by \nexisting research are beneficial to participants.20   However, to make the approach to employability \ntruly holistic, some focus should perhaps be placed on the \u201edemand\u201f side of links with employers, \nrather than concentrating solely on interventions addressing the individual (the \u201esupply\u201f side).21,22 \n \nConcerns regarding the length of CMPs and opportunities for follow-up were noted, as was criticism \nregarding access to interventions.  This suggests that it is important for CMPs to be flexible, \naccessible and tailored to both the specific needs of the individuals involved and the social contexts \nin which they are situated.11,23 Furthermore, it is essential for short-term and narrowly focused \nprojects to be embedded within longer-term, holistic support strategies.  In other words, given the \nwide variations in different conditions (and in individuals experiences of those conditions), there can \nbe no standard template for CMPs.  Related to this point, is the problem of dependency and the \nethics of empowering individuals to increase their coping skills and employability in a job poor \n 14 \nenvironment.  The idea of providing short term, largely lifestyle\/behavioural type programmes \ntargeted at specific conditions in isolation seems to be short sighted and the broader and often more \ncomplex needs of individuals are likely to be better provided for in client-centred case management \napproaches to support, which respond to changing problems and concerns.  Research by Lindsay \n(2002) supports this observation24.  Also, there is clearly a role for employers in terms of creating a \nsupportive environment by physical, psychological and organisational means, for example by offering \nergonomic work stations, courses on stress management or flexible working conditions to facilitate \nreturn to work. \n \nA common theme emerging from the Cardiac Rehabilitation, GP Referrals, Lower Back Pain and \nSmoking Cessation focus groups (i.e. the four projects which were implemented in a group setting) \nwas the perceived benefit of support provided through group interaction.  It is possible, as \ndemonstrated in a Canadian study of return to work after prolonged sickness absence, that such \nsocial support can itself facilitate positive employment outcomes.25     Indeed, the positive impacts of \ngroup interventions have been well documented in several areas relevant to general practice and \nprimary care.  For example, van Haastregt et al. (2007) showed that socialising and learning from \neach other were important impacts of participation in a group programme designed to reduce fear of \nfalling in older people.26  Similarly, a study evaluating group support for informal carers during the \nprocess of palliative home care showed that a sense of belonging and group cohesion were benefits \nof the intervention.27  The findings from the study presented here corroborate these observations in \nthe context of condition management and provide experiential evidence of the benefits of intervention \ndelivery in group settings, which could be used to inform the design and implementation of CMPs.  \nThis is not to suggest, however, that a group setting is appropriate for all individuals experiencing all \nof the conditions these CMPs aimed to address as it may well be that group settings are not \nappropriate for individuals accessing counselling, for example.  In terms of (re)connection with the \nlabour market, the positive outcomes described by participants in the Counselling, Lower Back Pain, \n 15 \nGP Referrals and Cardiac Rehabilitation focus groups, are in keeping with the wider evidence base \nfor the return to work effects of vocational rehabilitation.  For example, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Alricsson and \nAsplund (2008) demonstrate how a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for back and neck pain \nresulted in decreased full time sick leave for a period of up to two years after the end of the \nprogramme.28  \n \nIncreased confidence and self-esteem, were frequently reported as benefits in all five CMPs, in \naddition to the other health-related outcomes, such as improved pain management, increased fitness \nand mobility that were reported in the four CMPs dealing with physical health conditions.  Together \nthese findings extend the evidence base on the impacts of CMPs collated from other recent \nevaluations, which have tended to concentrate only on employability outcomes.7,10 Participants\u201f \nconcerns relating to difficulties in accessing CMPs were also flagged up in an evaluation of CMPs \nfrom the perspective of CMP practitioners or facilitators.4  Similarly, the need for long term, intensive \nand personalised support has been highlighted by a number of authors in relation to other types of \nemployability initiatives.20,11  Indeed, our conclusion that a \u201eone size fit all approach\u201f is inappropriate \nfor the design and delivery of CMPs, aligns with the findings of McQuaid and Lindsay (2005), who \nmake a similar observation in relation to the generic design of some employability interventions.29   \n \nStudy Limitations \nIt should be noted that, as a qualitative study, our findings are inevitably context specific and capture \nthe views of only those individuals who agreed to participate in the research.  Nevertheless, the data \nprovide useful insights into how individuals experience CMPs and, given the comparability of the \nstudy area with other parts of the UK (in terms of, for example, IB profiles), the lessons drawn in this \nresearch may aid the design of future CMPs.   The study may also provide some guidance to help \nGPs support patients through similar types of employability and CMP initiatives.   \n \n 16 \nAll of the research participants were recruited through project co-ordinators, who adopted a \ngatekeeping role.  There is potential that this may have resulted in a biased selection of respondents \nas project co-ordinators may have been more likely to recruit participants whom they felt would \nprovide positive accounts of their experiences on the CMP they were involved in.  Nevertheless, the \ndata do include a number of criticisms and concerns relating to the various projects, which suggests \nthat we were able to engage with individuals who had experienced difficulties with, as well as benefits \nof, the projects.  Although the aim of the study presented here was to provide insights into how \nindividuals view and experience CMPs, future research might augment this qualitative approach by \nincluding indicators of pain management and psychosocial health that are suitable to quantitative \nanalysis.   \n \nConclusion \nThe findings we present support the function of multi-disciplinary, biopsychosocial programmes from \nparticipants\u201f perspectives and underline the need for long term follow-up in all types of CMPs.  \nHowever, some commentators might argue that placing the responsibility for return to work on the \nindividual is a rather victim blaming approach30.  With this in mind, the role of GPs, other health \nprofessionals and Jobcentre Plus staff (particularly for those individuals who find the medicalisation of \ntheir conditions problematic) should be promoted in the delivery of support and advice before, during \nand after a CMP, in order to help maintain and build on the health improvements and\/or transition \nback into the labour market facilitated by CMPs.  Moreover, of course there is a need for those \ndelivering this type of intervention to acknowledge the broader social determinants of ill health and to \nview the condition for which the patient is being treated in a wider context, thereby addressing the \nvaried and complex needs that many individuals face.  The data also offer insights into whether \nadditional means of accessing CMPs should be considered, particularly for conditions which are often \nconstructed by patients as being broader than merely a biomedical concern, such as mental health \nconditions.  In addition to the importance of offering longer term support, this study suggests there \n 17 \ncan be no \u201eone size fits all\u201f approach to CMPs.  Instead, given the complex and varying conditions \nand needs of those accessing these services, there is a requirement for context sensitivity and \nindividualised support in the design, implementation and follow-up of CMPs, accompanied by a \nbroader strategic framework which offers the potential for longer-term support and advice. \n \nEthics approval \n[Removed for anonymity] University School for Health Ethics Committee  \n \nSource of funding  \n[Removed for anonymity] Local Strategic Partnership \n \nConflict of interest \nNone \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to [removed for anonymity] for their assistance with data collection and administrative support.
