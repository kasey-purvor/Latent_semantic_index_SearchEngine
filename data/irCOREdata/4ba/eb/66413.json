INTRODUCTION\nThe conventional processing of semiconductors relies on\nthe ability to control impurities which are usually present in\nthe devices at higher concentrations than are in the starting\nmaterials. The use of polycrystalline thin films for solar cells\naims to reduce the cost by utilizing lower grade source ma-\nterials. The irreproducibility of the characteristics of such\ndevices and their degradation have yet to be addressed.\nPostgrowth annealing-induced activation of thin-film\nCdTe\/CdS solar cells with CdCl2 represents a crucial step in\nthe device fabrication process. This treatment has been\nshown to affect not only the CdTe absorbing layer but also\nthe CdS window layer, leading to a change in the cell\ncharacteristics.1 It is the impurities in the window layer that\nare the subject of this paper.\nThe effect of impurities present in the CdS window layer\non CdTe-based solar cell devices has not been thoroughly\ninvestigated, and it is not yet fully understood in terms of\ntheir influence on the efficiency, stability, and lifetime of\nthese devices.2 Nevertheless, some particular studies point to\nthe importance of impurities in this context. For example, the\nphotovoltaic characteristics of CdTe\/CdS solar cells fabri-\ncated using boron-doped CdS were shown to improve due to\nthe increase of the electrical conductivity and the optical\nband gap of the CdS with doping.3 Also, some test cells\ncomposed of p-type Cu-doped CdS and n-type CdS layers\nwere fabricated and their photovoltaic response attributed to\na homojunction.4 Indirect effects have also been noted: for\nexample, CdS surface contamination and chemical composi-\ntion were shown to depend on the growth method used.5\nAdditionally, the surface morphology and pretreatment of the\ntransparent conductive oxide sTCOd have been found to af-\nfect the physical properties of the CdS film subsequently\ndeposited on it, eventually changing the performance of\nCdTe\/CdS solar cells.6\nDespite the importance of impurities in semiconductors,\nfew attempts to measure them in CdTe\/CdS devices have\nbeen reported in the literature. In particular, there is little\nsystematic or quantitative work, with secondary-ion-mass\nspectroscopy sSIMSd, profiles on entire device structures be-\ning generally restricted to a few impurity elements and done\nthrough the \u201cback wall,\u201d i.e., proceeding from the CdTe sur-\nface. This back wall approach has limitations\u2014principally a\npoor depth resolution due to the roughness of the back sur-\nface and the large depth that has to be profiled to get to the\nburied CdTe\/CdS interface. To overcome this difficulty, pol-\nished CdTe surfaces were used,7 but only one SIMS analysis\nfrom the \u201cfront wall,\u201d i.e., by sputtering from the TCO to the\nsemiconductors, has been reported.8\nThis paper reports a systematic quantitative study of im-\npurities in the window layers of CdTe\/CdS\/TCO\/glass solar\ncells, this also being done with sufficient depth resolution to\nidentify interface effects. This was achieved by dynamic and\nquantitative SIMS of CdTe\/CdS\/TCO\/glass structures in the\nfront wall geometry after the removal of the glass substrate.\nThe analysis was then performed from the sflatd TCO free\nsurface through the CdTe absorbing layer. Particular empha-\nsis was placed on the potentially electrically active impuri-\nties present in the CdS window layer especially those likely\nto originate from the CdCl2 heat treatment; it is these impu-\nrities that are likely to affect the device performance.adElectronic mail: m.emziane@dur.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 97, 114910 s2005d\n0021-8979\/2005\/97~11!\/114910\/6\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics97, 114910-1\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

While Na\nand Si were apparently concentrated at the CdS interfaces in\nthe as-grown structures, they had a concentration peak in the\nCdS after treatment. Also, Zn, Si, and In showed slightly\nreduced concentrations on the CdCl2 heat treatment. Te dif-\nfusion into the CdS layer on the CdCl2 heat treatment was\nalso measured.\nThe potential origins of these impurities and their con-\ncentration changes are discussed. For instance, it was shown\nthat Si and Na were originating mainly from the glass sub-\nstrate during the growth and\/or processing steps, and that In\nand O were due mostly to the TCO. A useful comparison was\nmade between the present results and the SIMS measure-\nments previously obtained on similar structures from the\nback wall.9 Moreover, the displacement of the positive- and\nnegative-ion concentration peaks reported earlier10 and the\naccumulation of Sb at the CdS\/TCO interface11 are called\ninto question.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe TCO sIn2O3:F, nominally 800 nm thickd and CdS\nsnominally 150 nm thickd layers were grown by sputtering\nwith a typical substrate temperature of 500 and 200 \u00b0C, re-\nspectively. The target purity was 99.999% for In2O3 and\n99.99% for CdS. We used two uncontacted CdTe\/CdS\/TCO\/\nglass solar cell-like structures fabricated separately using\nnominally identical conditions. The deposition and process-\ning conditions were the same as reported earlier in more\ndetail.9 Polycrystalline CdTe films were deposited on the\nCdS\/TCO\/glass substrates by close-space sublimation sCCSd\ntechnique. The substrate and source temperatures during the\ndeposition were kept at 500 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. The\ndeposition rate was adjusted at about 2 \u00b5m\/min and the\nthickness of the CdTe films was approximately 8\u201310 \u00b5m.\nBoth structures had their CdTe layer deposited using a start-\ning CdTe material of 7N purity si.e., 99.999 99%d and one of\nthem only was then heat treated with CdCl2 sthermally\nevaporated 150-nm-thick CdCl2 layer, 99.9% pured at 400 \u00b0C\nin air for 30 min, and subsequently chemically etched with\nBr2-methanol solution. This was carried out in order to study\nthe effect of the CdCl2 and chemical etching process on the\nimpurity distribution in the whole solar cell structure. To\nenable a SIMS investigation of both samples from the front\nwall side, i.e., from the TCO layer through the CdS and CdTe\nlayers, the glass substrates were removed by a combined\nmechanical and chemical polishing procedure. To do so, the\nCdTe surfaces of the 1-cm2 samples were stuck to aluminum\nplates using conductive epoxy to avoid charging during the\nSIMS measurements. Most of the glass was removed by me-\nchanical polishing and during the removal of the remainder\nwith 40% HF acid, the TCO layer acts as an etch-stop bar-\nrier.\nThe SIMS depth profiles were performed using a Cam-\neca ims-4f system on both the untreated and CdCl2 heat-\ntreated CdTe\/CdS\/TCO structures. Profiles of 208Pb, 128Te,\n121Sb, 118Sn, 115In, 66Zn, 63Cu, 37Cl, 34S, 28Si, 23Na, and 18O\nwere recorded. Ion-implanted undoped CdS standards were\ndepth profiled to determine the \u201cuseful ion yields\u201d of the\nelements and were used to perform quantitative interpreta-\ntion of the raw data recorded through the use of relative\nsensitivity factors sRSFsd. Implantations were performed at\nroom temperature using a 200-keV implanter and low doses\nwere used to obtain a maximum concentration level of\n1018 cm\u22123 for all the species considered. An oxygen primary\nbeam was used to determine the positive-ion yield and a\ncesium primary beam for the negative ions. Energies and\nanalyzed crater areas were as follows: 14.5 keV and ,60\n360 mm2 for Cs+, and 8 keV and ,1503150 mm2 for O2+.\nIII. RESULTS\nDuring the SIMS profiling it became clear that although\nthe layers were nominally identical, the thicknesses of both\nthe TCO and CdS layers were thinner in the processed\nsample than in the as-grown one. For ease of comparison, the\nSIMS data presented in Figs. 1\u20134 are therefore shifted so that\npairs of profiles are aligned at the CdS\/TCO interface. More-\nover, it should be noted that for some SIMS runs presented\nhere, the complete structure was profiled, i.e., from the TCO\nall the way through the back wall of the CdTe. These profiles\nFIG. 1. Impurity species showing an increased concentration following the\nCdCl2 heat treatment.

These three species ex-\nhibit an increased concentration in the treated sample as\ncompared to the untreated one. In the CdS layer, the concen-\ntration increases from 2.831018 to 1020 cm\u22123 for Cl and\nfrom 231018 to 1019 cm\u22123 for Sb. Na shows a very slight\nincrease, from 331019 to 431019 cm\u22123. Similar results were\nobtained when the same elements were investigated from the\nCdTe free surface through the glass substrate9 si.e., from the\nback wall of the structuresd. However, additional precision is\nobtained in the front wall geometry\u2014the structure of the Na\nprofile is discussed in Sec. IV.\nFigure 2 displays the SIMS depth profiles of Pb, O, and\nCu atoms in the untreated and CdCl2 heat-treated CdTe\/CdS\/\nTCO structures. These three species have their concentration\nprofile largely unchanged following the CdCl2 heat treat-\nment. The concentrations are 1017 and 331017 cm\u22123 for Pb\nand Cu, respectively. For O, the concentration decreases\nfrom s3\u20136d31022 cm\u22123 near the CdS\/TCO interface to\ns3\u20136d31019 cm\u22123 near the CdTe\/CdS interface, the trend be-\ning the same before and after the heat treatment. Profiles of\nSn are not shown because they overlap each other, do not\nshow any peaks, and are noisy around 1017 cm\u22123, below the\nSn detection limit. In our previous SIMS study from the back\nwall,9 these four impurity elements showed a constant con-\ncentration in CdTe on the CdCl2 heat treatment.\nThe SIMS depth profiles of Zn, Si, and In atoms are\nshown in Fig. 3 for both the untreated and CdCl2 heat-treated\nCdTe\/CdS\/TCO structures. Surprisingly, Zn, Si, and In show\napparent small decreases in concentration in CdS upon the\nCdCl2 heat treatment in comparison to the untreated samples.\nWithin CdS, the concentrations are s2\u20135d31019 cm\u22123 for Zn,\ns1\u20132d31018 cm\u22123 for Si, and 1019\u20131022 cm\u22123 for In. The de-\ntection of Zn and Cu in CdTe and the TCO was limited by\nthe detection limit in these layers, with the profiles being\ncharacteristically noisy and flat.\nThe SIMS profiles for Te and S atoms in both CdTe\/CdS\/\nTCO structures are shown in Fig. 4. The different layers and\napproximate interfaces are shown in all the figures. The\ndepth scale is accurate from the TCO free surface to the\nCdS\/TCO interface as the sputtering rate of TCO was used to\ngenerate the depth scale. Since the TCO sputtering rate is\ndifferent from the CdS and CdTe rates, the total depth sput-\ntered in the CdS and CdTe layers is therefore different from\nthat shown in all the figures.\nOverall, the front wall SIMS profiles shown in the fig-\nures exhibit less surface tailing compared to the profiles re-\ncorded for two similar structures from the CdTe back surface\nand reported earlier.9 An additional advantage is that the po-\nsitions and widths of the buried CdS\/TCO and CdTe\/CdS\ninterfaces, together with the approximate thickness of the\ndifferent layers, are more accurately determined here in com-\nFIG. 2.

For the\nimpurity species considered in the present investigation, the\nconcentrations recorded in the CdCl2 are summarized in\nTable I. Note that In and Te concentrations represent the\nmaximum values, i.e., the actual ones may well be lower due\nto the possible spectral interferences occurring in ICPMS as\npreviously discussed in detail.12\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIn discussing the SIMS results, it should be emphasized\nthat for all the profiles shown in the present study, the analy-\nsis is quantitative for the CdS layers only and qualitative for\nthe other layers, i.e., TCO and CdTe, as only RSFs for CdS\nwere used for the quantification of the SIMS data throughout\nthe structures.\nThe purpose of this study was to focus on the impurities\nthat have a known effect on the electrical sand most probably\non the opticald properties of the CdS window layer and that\nmay therefore affect the CdTe\/CdS device characteristics. By\nusing CdTe source material of 7N purity to grow CdTe\/CdS\/\nTCO\/glass structures and treating part of them with CdCl2,\nwe were able to distinguish not only the impurities that are\nrelated to the CdCl2 process, but also those due to the differ-\nent layers in the structure.\nNa, Sb, and Cl impurities shown in Fig. 1 might be\nconsidered to originate from the postgrowth processing as\nthey are present in the CdCl2 powder used. However, as\nshown in Table I, Na and Sb are present in the CdCl2 powder\nwith concentrations of 5.26 and 0.21 ppm, i.e., about 1017\nand 531015 cm\u22123, respectively. These concentrations are\nmore than two to three orders of magnitude lower in the\nCdCl2 starting powder compared to those for the same ele-\nments measured in the CdS matrix by SIMS sFig. 1d. It is\nclearly the case that if Na and Sb arise solely from the CdCl2\nthen either sad these elements are enriched in the CdS during\nthe treatment, perhaps by preferential evaporation onto the\ncells when they are coated with CdCl2 before heating, or sbd\nthese elements are not uniformly distributed throughout the\nCdTe\/CdS layer stack, and that there is some preferred seg-\nregation at the CdS layer and\/or its interfaces. One or both of\nsad and sbd are credible in that the concentration of Na, and\nmost notably of Sb, increase during the treatment. However,\nas the levels of both of these elements are already high in the\nas-grown structures, they may well have multiple origins.\nFor Na, the glass is the most obvious source, with incorpo-\nration of glass components in the CdS being a possibility\nduring the growth of the TCO and CdTe layers at a relatively\nhigh temperature. For Sb, a contamination from the CdS tar-\nget during the sputter deposition of CdS layer is more likely\nas the target used is 99.99% pure.\nThe present findings for Pb, O, Cu, and Sn in CdS are\nconsistent with those measured for CdTe from the back wall\nsi.e., invariant concentration profile on CdCl2 heat\ntreatmentd,9 and these four impurity elements are therefore\nnot considered due to the CdCl2 heat treatment as they con-\nserve the same concentration for both samples.\nIt is interesting to compare the impurity concentrations\nwe recorded by SIMS with some data available in the litera-\nture. The only quantitative SIMS analysis performed on\nFIG. 4. Te diffusion at the CdTe\/CdS interface.

The\nhigher Cu concentrations in those structures were caused by\nthe Cu diffusion from the Cu-containing back contact while\nour solar cell-like structures were uncontacted and contained\nno intentional Cu.\nN, C, and O were also profiled in another quantitative\nSIMS analysis on CdTe\/CdS solar cell devices fabricated us-\ning wet chemical methods.13 O concentrations were found to\nbe in the range of 1020\u20131021 cm\u22123 throughout all the struc-\ntures investigated, which is slightly higher than the O con-\ncentrations we obtained. This is because, in that study, the\nCdS layers were bath deposited sthus readily O contami-\nnatedd and air annealed prior to the CdTe growth. In our\ncase, CdS was sputtered and was not air processed before the\nsubsequent CdTe deposition by CSS. More importantly, that\ninvestigation concluded that there was neither an obvious\ncorrelation between the SIMS data and the device character-\nistics nor a simple relationship between the reagent concen-\ntrations in the CdS bath and the solar cell efficiency.13 For\nour structures, the O concentration in CdS ranged from\n,s3\u20136d31022 to ,s3\u20136d31019 cm\u22123 while only 4\n31018 cm\u22123 was measured in CdTe from the back wall.9\nThis indicates that O found in CdS may be coming from the\nIn2O3:F TCO although incorporation from the growth ssput-\ntering and CSSd and\/or processing environments should not\nbe excluded.\nIt was suggested that the thickness of the CdS window\nlayer influences the formation of the CdTe1\u2212xSx layer at the\nCdTe\/CdS interface, as well as the CdTe grain growth si.e.,\ngrain size and orientationd, affecting the photovoltaic perfor-\nmance of the CdTe\/CdS solar cell.14 Therefore, in discussing\nZn, Si, and In concentrations in the untreated and CdCl2\nheat-treated structures shown in Fig. 3, it would be appropri-\nate to take into account the difference in thickness for both\nTCO and CdS layers in the two structures. As mentioned\nabove, these two layers are much thinner in the treated\nsample compared to the untreated one, and this may affect\nthe comparison in terms of concentrations for these three\nimpurity species. In order to check this behavior, normalized\nprofiles snot shown hered were plotted for Zn, Si, and In\nassuming the same thickness for the CdS layer in both struc-\ntures. This normalization confirmed the slight decrease of the\nconcentration of the three elements following treatment. The\nSIMS data from the back wall showed that Zn conserved its\nconcentration in the CdTe layer on the CdCl2 heat treatment\nwhile Si and In concentrations increased following treat-\nment. During the CdCl2 treatment done at 400 \u00b0C, com-\npounds such as ZnCl2, InCl3, and SiCl4 may form, and while\nSiCl4 is gasious at this temperature, ZnCl2 and InCl3 have\nhigher vapor pressure compared to CdCl2. This is the most\nlikely explanation of the decrease recorded in the concentra-\ntion of Zn, Si, and In sFig. 3d after the CdCl2 treatment. Si\nfs1\u20132d31018 cm\u22123, Fig. 3g was not detected in the CdCl2\npowder sTable Id and its concentration is much higher than in\nthe CdTe layer as measured from the back wall s331015\u20134\n31016 cm\u22123, below the detection limitd,9 corroborating our\nprevious interpretation that Si is mostly diffusing from the\nsoda-lime glass substrate during the growth and\/or the treat-\nment of the structures, or else being transferred into the lay-\ners during sputter growth. As discussed above for Na, the\ndiffusion of Si from glass is likely to take place since while\nthe heat treatment is done at 400 \u00b0C for 30 min, the growth\nof the TCO and CdTe layers is performed at 500 \u00b0C. This\ntemperature is sufficently high, compared to the softening\npoint of the glass, to enable the diffusion of Si and Na. In has\na high concentration sbetween 1019 and 1022 cm\u22123, Fig. 3d\ncompared to its concentration in the CdCl2 powder s0.94\nppm or about 2.531016 cm\u22123d and also to its concentration\nin the CdTe layer measured from the back wall s331016\u20136\n31016 cm\u22123d.9 From these comparisons, we can deduce that\nIn is mainly originating from the In2O3:F TCO used and that\nthe contribution from CdCl2 is negligible. As for Zn, which\nwas not detected in the CdCl2 powder sTable Id, the concen-\ntration recorded in CdS fs2\u20135d31019 cm\u22123, Fig. 3g is at least\none order of magnitude higher than that measured in CdTe\nfrom the back wall.9 This difference is most likely due to the\nfact that different isotopes were monitored for the CdS layer\ns66Zn for this studyd and the CdTe layer s64Zn for the back\nwall SIMSd. The above quantitative comparisons between\nthe impurity concentrations measured in CdS from the front\nwall and in CdTe from the back wall are valid regardless of\nthe difference in the diffusion coefficient that these impurity\nspecies may have in CdS versus CdTe.\nTe depth profiles shown in Fig. 4sbd highlight the migra-\ntion of Te from CdTe into the CdS layer following the CdCl2\nheat treatment, since the concentration of Te in CdS is\nslightly higher for the treated structure compared to the un-\ntreated one. Similar observations were reported by many au-\nthors, and, in particular, recently by Kim et al.15\nThe profiles of Na fFig. 1sadg, S fFig. 4sadg, and Si fFig.\n3sbdg for the untreated sample show a double peak in the CdS\nlayer, which disappears becoming a single peak in the treated\nsample. This observation was repeated several times in dif-\nferent areas of the untreated sample. The most likely expla-\nnation of this behavior is that, for some reason, the ion yields\nat the CdS\/TCO and CdTe\/CdS interfaces were enhanced for\nthese species in the untreated structure.\nIn studying the distribution of impurities in the CdS,\nparticular care was taken to establish the positions of the\nconcentration peaks for Cl, Na, and S. In a previous report,10\nthese elements had been reported as having peaks that were\ndisplaced with respect to one another, the cations being\ncloser to the TCO than the anions. The displacement had\nbeen attributed to the field structure at the interfaces.10 Other\nauthors had also reported SIMS evidence of the segregation\nof Sb to the CdS\/TCO interface in support of an electrical\nmeasurement of impurity distribution.11 In the present work,\nhowever, the peaks for Cl, Na, and S were located at a depth\nof 0.86 \u00b5m from the TCO free surface, this being a repro-\nducible finding. Since the earlier work was done in the back\nwall SIMS geometry, a small error in the sputter rates deter-\nmined for positive and negative SIMS would result in a sig-\nnificant registration error between the two profiles.

We conclude that there is no\ndisplacement between the positive- and negative-ion concen-\ntration peaks and that the previous work was likely to be in\nerror.\n10,11\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY\nUsing SIMS, we quantitatively studied the concentration\nand distribution of impurity species in uncontacted CdTe\/\nCdS\/TCO\/glass solar cell-like structures. The SIMS depth\nprofiling proceeded from the TCO free surface through the\nCdS and CdTe layers, after the glass substrate was removed.\nTwo structures were investigated, and only one of them was\npostgrowth CdCl2 heat treated in order to determine the in-\nfluence of the CdCl2 heat treatment on the distribution and\nconcentration of impurities in the structures. The focus was\non the impurity species present in the CdS layer that may\nhave an electrical activity ultimately affecting the perfor-\nmance of the CdTe\/CdS device. Potential origins of such\nimpurities and their concentration changes were discussed\nand compared to the SIMS measurements previously ob-\ntained on the same structures from the \u201cback wall.\u201d\nThe findings of the present study can be summarized as\nfollows.\ns1d Following the CdCl2 heat treatment, Cl and Sb im-\npurities had higher concentrations in CdS, with Na being\nslightly increased. For the as-grown samples, Na was con-\ncentrated at the CdTe\/CdS and the CdS\/TCO interfaces,\nwhile processing caused the peak concentrations to shift to\nthe CdS layer itself.\ns2d Pb, O, Sn, and Cu conserved their concentration in\nCdS on the CdCl2 treatment.\ns3d Zn, Si, and In showed slightly lower concentrations\nin CdS after the CdCl2 heat treatment, this reduction being\nexplained by the volatility of the chlorides of these elements.\ns4d Si and Na were mainly originating from the glass\nsubstrate during the growth and\/or treatment steps.\ns5d In and O were mostly due to the In2O3:F layer used\nas TCO.\ns6d After processing with CdCl2 the concentration peaks\nof Cl, Na, and S were positioned at the same point in the CdS\nlayer, regardless of whether they are positive or negative\nspecies. Earlier reports of an ion displacement effect10,11 are\nattributed to an error of measurement.\nThis study shows the advantages of using \u201cfront wall\u201d\nSIMS geometry for the superior and reliable resolution it\nprovides. It also shows the direct implication that the fabri-\ncation steps si.e., growth and treatmentd and their reproduc-\nibility may have on the concentration and distribution of im-\npurities in the solar cell structures. The possible relationship\nbetween the impurity profiles in the structures and the device\nperformance, its reproducibility and stability needs to be fur-\nther investigated.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank A.
