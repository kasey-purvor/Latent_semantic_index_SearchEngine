That tantalizing question reflects a dream that\nsome have hoped to realize by exploiting the energy-stor-\nage capabilities of nuclear isomers. But the hope hinges on\nfacets of nuclear behavior that remain unknown despite\ndecades of study. Electromagnetic transitions and b decay,\nthe basic mechanisms that largely determine isomer half-\nlives, are well understood. In many cases, however, it is\nstill not possible to predict half-lives even to within an\norder of magnitude.\nToday\u2019s isomer research seeks a better understanding\nof the degrees of freedom that will reveal new aspects of\nnuclear structure and lead the way to new applications. In\nthis article, we lay out the essential ingredients of nuclear\nisomerism and take a look at future possibilities.\nMetastable excited states\nThe term \u201cisomer\u201d is borrowed from chemistry, where it\nrefers to molecules that have different geometrical config-\nurations of the same collection of atoms. Isomeric nuclei,\nas distinguished from isotopes, are different states of the\nsame numbers of protons and neutrons. Whereas chemi-\ncal isomers have energy states that are similar, sometimes\nidentical, to each other, nuclear isomers always have dif-\nferent energies. Excitation energies can be as high as sev-\neral MeV.\nAn interesting example of a nuclear isomer is 99mTc, an\nexcited state of technetium-99. The \u201cm\u201d after the mass\nnumber denotes a metastable state\u2014that is, a long-lived\nisomer. The half-life of 99mTc is six hours and its excitation\nenergy above the nuclear ground state of 99Tc is 143 keV.\nBy contrast, typical half-lives of excited nuclear states are\nabout a picosecond. Isomers live at least a thousand times\nlonger. The appellation is usually reserved for excited nu-\nclear states that live longer than a nanosecond. The su-\nperscript \u201cm\u201d is even more restrictive; it\u2019s reserved for iso-\nmers with half-lives of more than a millisecond. If a\nnuclear species has more than one metastable isomer, an\nordinal number after the \u201cm\u201d distinguishes between them\nin ascending order of excitation energy.\nPerhaps the most widely known nuclear isomer is the\nlong-lived hafnium excitation 178m2Hf. With a half-life of 31\nyears, it sits 2.4 MeV above the stable 178Hf ground state. The\nexceptional combination of high excita-\ntion energy and conveniently long half-\nlife has led to claims for practical appli-\ncations that have lent the hafnium\nisomer unusual visibility (see PHYSICS\nTODAY, May 2004, page 21).\nNature\u2019s sole example of an iso-\nmer long-lived enough to be called sta-\nble is 180mTa. This tantalum isomer\u2019s\nhalf-life exceeds 1015 years. One can only quote a lower life-\ntime limit, because the isomer\u2019s spontaneous decay has\nnever been observed. But the isomer sits 77 keV above a\nground state that is itself unstable, with a b-decay half-\nlife of only eight hours.\nIsomers can lose their excess energy by the usual ra-\ndioactive decay modes: a, b, or g. The favored mode in any\nparticular case depends on the energies and quantum num-\nbers of the states involved. Decay by neutron or proton\nemission, or even by fission, is possible for some isomers.\nWhat can isomers reveal about nuclei and about the\nenvironments\u2014for example, sites of astrophysical nucle-\nosynthesis\u2014in which they are formed? How can nuclear\nisomers be put to practical uses here on Earth?\nIsomers in the clinic\nThe nuclear isomer that is most often ingested for clinical\npurposes is 99mTc. It has excellent properties for medical im-\naging: a convenient half-life of six hours and an equally con-\nvenient soft-gamma-ray decay energy of 141 keV. Another\nuseful feature is technetium\u2019s ability to bind chemically with\nmany biomolecules. Furthermore, the isomer is easy to pro-\nduce. One can, for example, bombard molybdenum-98 with\nneutrons from a reactor to make 99Mo, which then b-decays\nwith a half-life of 66 hours to 99mTc. The technetium isomer\nis probably the most widely used of all radioactive isotopes\nfor medical diagnostics. It is used to image the brain, bones,\nheart, lungs, and other organs (see figure 1).\nIt\u2019s not, in fact, the emission of the 141-keV gamma\nthat gives 99mTc its desirably long half-life. The six hours\nare taken almost entirely by the first step in the isomer\u2019s\ndescent to the ground state. That preliminary step is a \n2-keV decay by electron conversion, in which nuclear ex-\ncitation energy is carried away by the ejection of an orbital\nelectron from the atom. The subsequent emission of the\n141-keV gamma from the nucleus takes less than a\nnanosecond.\nThe long half-life of the first step of 99mTc decay is at-\ntributable to the isomer\u2019s angular momentum. Its spin J\nand parity p are Jp \u2282\n1\/2\u2297. But the state 2 keV below the\nisomer has Jp \u2282\n7\/2\u2295. Therefore the initial 2-keV electro-\nmagnetic step between those two states is governed by an\nelectric-octupole (E3) transition-matrix element. A direct\n143-keV transition from the isomer straight to the Jp \u2282\n9\/2\u2295\nground state would have magnetic-hexadecapole (M4)\ncharacter. Such high-multipole electromagnetic transi-\ntions are very slow. \n\u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics, S-0031-9228-0506-020-5  June 2005    Physics Today 39\nPhilip Walker is a professor of physics at the University of Sur-\nrey in England. James J. Carroll is a professor of physics at\nYoungstown State University in Ohio.\nIsomers are set apart from other nuclear excitations by their\nlong half-lives.That longevity facilitates the study of nuclear\nstructure and astrophysics, and it suggests a variety of\npractical applications.\nPhilip M. Walker and James J. Carroll\nUps and Downs of Nuclear IsomersAnother unusual aspect of 99mTc is that technetium\n(Z = 43) has no stable nuclei. Its longest-lived isotope, 98Tc,\nhas a half-life of 4 million years. Therefore it\u2019s not found\nin natural deposits on Earth. It was the first new element\nto be produced artificially (in 1937). Hence its name, from\nthe Greek technetos, meaning artificial. Promethium\n(Z = 61), the only other element lighter than lead that has\nno stable isotopes, was first made in the laboratory in 1945.\nIsomers in the stars\nBecause Tc has no stable isotopes, it is especially inter-\nesting for astrophysics. From observations of its lines in\natomic spectra of red-giant stars, one finds that Tc is being\nmade in such stars by nuclear reactions between other el-\nements. Visible light from Tc atoms far away brings to us\nthe most compelling evidence of nature\u2019s ongoing cosmic\nalchemy.\nThe study of naturally occurring radionuclides sur-\nviving from Earth\u2019s formation has provided the most ac-\ncurate information about the age of our planet\u2014about 4.6\nbillion years. Nuclides with half-lives of much less than a\nbillion years are now at low or vanishing abundance. For\nexample, uranium-238, with a half-life of 4.47 \u00d7 109 years,\nis now the most abundant uranium isotope by far. But 235U,\non which most fission power depends, has a half-life of only\n7.04 \u00d7 108 years and an abundance of 0.7% relative to 238U.\nIf Earth had formed with equal abundances of each, the\n235U\/238U abundance ratio would now be 2.4%. Therefore,\nthere must have been several times more 238U to start with.\nBut that starting point depends on the details of stellar\nnucleosynthesis.\nNuclear isomers probe this astrophysical alchemy and\nthe stellar environments in which it takes place. With its\nhalf-life much longer than the 1010-year age of the cos-\nmos,180mTa is the only naturally occurring isomer that\u2019s\nstable on the scale of stellar lifetimes. But many isomers\nthat b-decay on much shorter time scales can serve as use-\nful stellar probes. \nThe exceptional half-life of 180mTa, like that of 99mTc,\nhinges on angular momentum. This time, though, the iso-\nmer\u2019s own high spin is the impediment. Its spin\u2013parity\nstate is 9\u2297. Ashort-lived excited state 37 keV below the iso-\nmer has Jp \u2282 2\u2295, and the nuclear ground state is\n1\u2295. Therefore, electromagnetic transitions from the\nisomer, if they exist, would have E7 and M8 char-\nacter. But such high-multipole transitions have\nnever been seen.\nFor tantalum in stars, the issue is the b-decay-\ning ground state of 180Ta. If the star is hot enough\n(above 109 K), excitation and de-excitation of nuclei\nby thermal photons will yield an equilibrium mixture of the\nground and isomeric states. That\u2019s the kind of environment\nrequired for slow-neutron-capture (s-process) nucleosyn-\nthesis (see the article by John Cowan and Friedrich-Karl\nThielemann in PHYSICS TODAY, 0ctober 2004, page 47).\nIf one of the nuclear states in such an equilibrium b-\ndecays with a short half-life, then the longer-lived state\nwill be depleted\u2014that is, its effective half-life is reduced.\nThe case of 180Ta is of particular interest because the tran-\nsition probabilities for g-excitation to higher-lying states\nfrom which it can decay have recently been measured.1\nFrom those measurements, and the fact that 180mTa exists\non Earth (albeit with the lowest abundance of any stable\nnuclide), one can infer that s-process production of the iso-\nmer takes place in stars at modest temperatures less than\n3 \u00d7 108 K.\nHowever, the actual mechanism by which 180mTa is\nsynthesized remains a mystery. Proton capture and neu-\ntrino reactions are two possibilities. The name tantalum\nis particularly appropriate to the ongoing challenge of puz-\nzling out the isomer\u2019s origins. The mythological Tantalus,\nmiscreant son of Zeus, is perpetually punished by being\nkept just out of reach of food and water.\nA central role\nIsomers were first foreseen by Fredrick Soddy, long before\nthe discovery of the neutron. In 1917 he wrote, \u201cWe can\nhave isotopes with identity of atomic weight, as well as of\nchemical character, which are different in their stability\nand mode of breaking up.\u201d Otto Hahn is usually credited\nwith the first experimental observation of isomers, in ura-\nnium salts in 1921. But the key observations came in 1935,\nwhen nuclear physicists in the Soviet Union and Britain\nfound isomers in bromine and indium.2 These discoveries\nwere soon followed by Carl von Weizsacker\u2019s theoretical\nexplanation in terms of angular-momentum quantum\nnumbers.3 He was describing \u201cspin traps,\u201d which turn out\nto be the principal class of isomers. Spin traps relax very\nslowly because high-multipole electromagnetic transition\namplitudes are intrinsically weak. \nThe explanation for the existence of high-spin states\ncame from the formulation of the nuclear shell model in\n40 June 2005    Physics Today http:\/\/www.physicstoday.org\nFigure 1. Medical imaging with the technetium\nisomer 99mTc shows a front view of a patient with\nseptic arthritis in the left knee. The widely used\nisomer decays with a half-life of six hours by\nemitting a 141-keV photon. The isomeric mate-\nrial, bound to a ligand compound, was injected\nintravenously. The ligand preferentially seeks out\nmetabolically active sites such as the inflamed\nknee in this case. The radioactive emission was\nmapped by a gamma camera whose crystalline\nsodium iodide scintillator elements scan around\nthe patient.\nU\nN\nI\nV\nE\nR\nS\nI\nT\nY\n \nH\nO\nS\nP\nI\nT\nA\nL\nS\n \nO\nF\n \nC\nL\nE\nV\nE\nL\nA\nN\nD1949. Indeed, the existence of iso-\nmers demanded the shell model. In-\ndividual nucleon orbits must be able\nto carry high angular momentum,\nand the existence of isomers de-\npends on the quantum numbers of\nthose individual orbits. Notwith-\nstanding this strong tie to the sin-\ngle-particle emphasis of the shell\nmodel, isomers also provided essen-\ntial information for the collective as-\npects of nucleons in the nucleus. In\n1953, Aage Bohr and Ben Mottelson4\ninterpreted the energies of the 180Hf\nstates one sees following the decay\nof 180mHf as being characteristic of a\nquantum rotor, with energies pro-\nportional to J(J \u2295 1). Thus did iso-\nmers take their place at the center\nof nuclear-structure investigations.\nIn the 1960s, nuclear isomers\nprovided the first examples of su-\nperdeformed nuclei; they were\ntwice as long as they were wide. The\nsuperdeformed americium isomer\n242mAm, discovered in 1962, decays\nby fission.5At the end of the decade,\nthe cobalt isomer 53mCo yielded the\nfirst observation of decay by direct\nproton emission.6 Those discoveries\nhave paved the way to extensive in-\nvestigations of the associated decay\nphenomena.7 No one has yet found an isomer that decays\nby neutron emission.\nNeutron-rich nuclides\nLet us focus on some recent developments and unsolved\nproblems. Access to heavy nuclides on the neutron-rich side\nof the valley of stability is experimentally difficult, but\nhighly desirable. Figure 2 shows this wide-open region of\nunknown nuclides. The physics objectives include the un-\nderstanding of neutron skins of such nuclei\u2014the outer vol-\nume into which the neutron distribution extends signifi-\ncantly beyond the proton distribution. One also wants to\ndetermine the structure of nuclides along the path of rapid-\nneutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. Understand-\ning the r process could yield deep insight into supernova\nexplosions. Because nuclear binding becomes very weak\nhttp:\/\/www.physicstoday.org June 2005    Physics Today 41\n114\n184\n162\n126\n82\n82\n50\n50 50\n50\n28\n28\n20\n20\n8\n2\n28 NEUTRON NUMBER N\nPROTON NUMBER\nZ\nFigure 2. The chart of nuclides shows naturally occurring stable nuclides\n(black squares) clustered along the valley of nuclear stability. Unstable nu-\nclear species known from the laboratory are shown in color. Double lines \nindicate magic (closed-shell) neutron and proton numbers. The dashed outer\ncontour, indicating the limits of nuclear binding, shows that many neutron-\nrich nuclides are yet to be discovered. Microsecond isomers promise espe-\ncially sensitive access to presently unknown nuclides.\nA\nll even\u2013even nuclides (that is, those having even proton\nand neutron numbers) have ground states of zero total-an-\ngular-momentum quantum number J and positive parity p.\nThat\u2019s because all the single-particle nucleon orbits are\npaired, giving the state of lowest total energy. Here we neg-\nlect the contribution of collective rotation of the entire nu-\ncleus, which can in general add energy and angular momen-\ntum to that arising from the individual nucleon orbits (see box\n2). Excitation of the nucleus may break up a pair of nucleons,\nwith one or both being promoted to higher orbits. This exci-\ntation is called a two-quasiparticle state to emphasize the im-\nportance of the pairing interaction, which modifies the energy\nand wavefunction of the nuclear level.\nThe remaining even\u2013even core of nucleons contributes no\nexcitation energy or angular momentum. That role belongs to\nthe quasiparticles. Suppose two quasiparticles (that is, two\nbroken-pair nucleons) in different orbits each had Jp \u2282\n11\/2\u2295.\nThe total angular momentum of the nucleus would come\nfrom their vector sum. In that case, Jp could range from 0\u2295 to\n11\u2295, depending on the relative orientation of the quasiparticle\nspins. Thus, high nuclear spin can result from as few as two\nunpaired nucleons.\n\u201cSpin-trap\u201d isomers occur in even\u2013even nuclei in just this\nway, when excited states require large-multipole electromag-\nnetic transitions for their decay. In 178Hf, for example, the 31-\nyear 16+ isomer has four-quasiparticle character\u2014that is, one\nbroken neutron pair and one broken proton pair. But spin-trap\nisomers can also occur in odd\u2013even or odd\u2013odd nuclei. The\nnuclide 180Ta is odd\u2013odd. Its two-quasiparticle 1+ ground state\nalready has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron.\nThe ultralong-lived 9\u2297 isomer 180mTa also has two-quasiparti-\ncle character, but with very different relative orientations of\nthe neutron and proton orbits. High angular momentum ex-\nplains these isomers qualitatively. But quantitatively, the situ-\nation is less satisfactory.\nBoth the spherical nuclear shell model of orbiting nucleons\nand the deformed-shell (Nilsson) model, which allows for non-\nspherical shapes, predict the existence of isomers. But beyond\nthese shell models of independently orbiting nucleons, there\nare additional interactions between the unpaired nucleons and\nthe core, and between quasiparticles, that are hard to quantify.\nThey lead to uncertainties on the order of 100 keV in the pre-\ndicted excitation energies of isomers. There is also significant\nuncertainty in the calculation of isomer decay rates to collec-\ntive rotational or vibrational states of the core.\nAlthough the bulk behavior of the wavefunctions of iso-\nmers and other excited states are relatively well understood,\nthe full details are still missing. Because electromagnetic\ndecay rates depend sensitively on the overlap between wave-\nfunctions for initial and final states, small discrepancies on\nthe wings of the wavefunctions can lead to very different re-\nsults. Additional data will be required for sorting out the rela-\ntive importance of the different mechanisms that contribute to\nisomer decay.\nBox 1. Broken Pairs and Isomer Half-Liveswith increasing neutron ex-\ncess, mean-field theoretical\nmodels may turn out to be\ncompletely inadequate in the\nneutron-rich domain.\nA promising way of pro-\nducing and studying neutron-\nrich nuclides and their excited\nstates was pioneered at the\nGANIL laboratory in Caen,\nFrance, and the GSI labora-\ntory in Darmstadt, Germany.\nAt these heavy-ion accelera-\ntor facilities, projectile nuclei\nfragment in high-energy colli-\nsions with target nuclei, and\none finds isomers amid the\ndebris.\nIn a recent experiment at\nGSI, Monica Caama\u00f1o and\ncoworkers bombarded a\nberyllium-9 target with\nstripped lead-208 nuclei ac-\ncelerated to an energy of\n1 GeV per nucleon.8 The frag-\nments of the Pb nucleus, after\nbeing tracked through a mag-\nnetic separator, were stopped\nand their g-decay photons\nwere measured in germanium detectors (see figure 3). The\nexperimenters were able to associate the emitted gammas,\nion by ion, with specific fragments over decay-sequence\ncorrelation times as long as 100 ms. In this way, Caama\u00f1o\nand company identified eleven new isomeric states of neu-\ntron-rich nuclides with mass numbers from 188 to 203. The\nisomeric half-lives ranged from 10 ns to 1 ms.\nThese neutron-rich nuclides are still some way from\nthe neutron-skin regime and the r-process pathway. Nev-\nertheless, such studies are paving the way to those longer-\nterm objectives. At the same time, the experiments have\nalready uncovered unexpected nuclear-structure effects.\nAn important feature of isomers with half-lives in the mi-\ncrosecond region is the experimenter\u2019s ability to correlate\nfragments of the projectile nucleus with their decay prod-\nucts. A few microseconds is long enough to track and iden-\ntify the fragments, yet short enough to distinguish time-\ncorrelated decay events from accidental background\ncorrelations.\nFor longer-lived fragments, one can observe isomer\nand ground-state properties by injecting the fragments\ninto a storage ring.9 In recent measurements of heavy, neu-\ntron-rich nuclei by the storage-ring technique, experi-\nmenters were seeking, among other things, a predicted\nJp \u2282 18\u2295 isomer of 188Hf that might have intriguing simi-\nlarities to the much-touted isomer 178m2Hf, whose spin\u2013par-\nity is 16+. The data are still under analysis.\nThe development of new, high-intensity projectile-\nfragmentation facilities is now a key part of planning for\nthe future of nuclear physics worldwide, with projects such\nas RIA (Rare Isotope Accelerator) in the US and FAIR \n(Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) in Germany.\nWhile addressing a wide range of nuclear and applied-sci-\nence issues, these new facilities will provide important\nnew opportunities for the study of isomers, especially in\nheavy, neutron-rich nuclides.\nSuperheavy nuclides\nThe search for the heaviest possible elements is a quest of\nlong standing. For the so-called superheavy elements\u2014\nthose with more than 100 protons\u2014the strong nuclear\nforce between adjacent nucleons is insufficient to overcome\nthe longer-range Coulomb repulsion between the protons.\nTheir existence relies on subtle shell-model effects on the\norbits of protons and neutrons inside the nucleus. Such\nsmall effects can, in fact, yield long half-lives\u2014but just\nhow long remains uncertain. We don\u2019t know, for example,\nthe true nature of the predicted \u201cisland of stability\u201d at \nnuclear masses beyond the present experimental limits.\nSuperheavy nuclei can have isomer states. Indeed,\nsuch isomers can live longer than their ground states.10\nFission is often described by the liquid-drop model. A key\nfeature of the superheavy isomers is that the nucleon-pair\nbreaking which makes their formation possible also breaks\ndown the superfluidity of the nucleon fluid inside the nu-\ncleus. It becomes viscous, and that slows down the fission\nprocess. The probability for a-particle decay is also re-\nduced by the pair breaking. For example, an isomer of\ndarmstadtium-270 (the name was officially given to ele-\nment 110 two years ago) has been found to have a half-life\nsome 60 times longer than its ground state. Thus the pre-\ndicted abundance of isomers in superheavy nuclei could be\nof great help in the exploration of that extreme frontier of\nthe nuclear landscape.\nVibration and rotation\nThe total angular momentum of a nucleus has contribu-\ntions from individual nucleon orbits and from collective ro-\ntation of the nucleus as a whole. Bonded pairs of orbits\nand, especially, closed shells of such pairs contribute no net\nangular momentum. In strongly deformed nuclei, nucleon\nnumbers are far from shell closure, and collective rotation\nusually dominates the low-energy, high-angular-momen-\ntum structure. This happens when the orbits of unpaired\nnucleons cannot generate much angular momentum on\ntheir own. In that case, high total angular momentum re-\nsults most easily (at low energies) from  high collective ro-\ntation plus a lesser contribution from any unpaired orbits.\nThere is, however, a small region of nuclides around\n178Hf (Z \u2282 72 and N \u2282 106, see figure 4) where isomers are\n42 June 2005    Physics Today http:\/\/www.physicstoday.org\nBe target\nPb beam Degrader\nDegrader\nTiming and tracking detectors\nTime-of-flight\ndetector\ng detectors\ng detectors\nCatcher\nSpectrometer\nmagnets\nSpectrometer\nmagnets\nFigure 3. The fragment separator at GSI, the heavy-ion accelerator facility in Darmstadt,\nGermany, is a prolific source of newly discovered isomers. In a recent experiment,8 lead-208\nnuclei, accelerated to 1 GeV per nucleon, fragment on a beryllium target. Fragments are\nseparated and steered by magnets, and tracked and timed by wire-chamber and scintillation\ndetectors. They are finally stopped by a \u201ccatcher\u201d in the middle of an array of segmented\ngermanium detectors that record gamma-ray photons from the de-excitation of isomers.\u201cyrast.\u201d The term, from the Swedish word for dizziest,\nrefers to the lowest-energy nuclear state for a given angu-\nlar momentum. For an yrast isomer, the contribution of\ncollective rotation to the angular momentum is minimal.\nThe isomers near 178Hf are yrast as a result of high-spin\nnucleon orbitals close to the Fermi surface. That effect is\nwell described by the deformed-shell model11 (see box 1).\nVibrational excitations of deformed nuclei are known\nto be energetically disfavored. They are far from the yrast\nstates. Recent findings, however, have given evidence for\na new type of energetically favored vibrational behavior\nbased on isomers. This effect arises because the maximum-\nangular-momentum vibrational states have energies pro-\nportional to J, whereas rotational energies depend qua-\ndratically on J. Thus, as angular momentum increases,\nrotational excitations become increasingly expensive rela-\ntive to vibrational excitations. Lee Pattison (University of\nManchester, UK) and coworkers have reported a dramatic\nconsequence of this competition.12 On top of the Jp \u2282 25\u2295\nisomer of osmium-182, they found a sequence of vibra-\ntional excitations that are, in fact, yrast. Their theoretical\nunderstanding of this structure is, thus far, based on a\nmodel of \u201ctidal waves\u201d that offers a new perspective on nu-\nclear excitation modes.\nIsomer decay in deformed nuclei\nSo far the discussion has concentrated on the utility of iso-\nmers for illuminating other nuclear phenomena. Now we\ntake a closer look at isomer decay rates, focusing on so-\ncalled K isomers in deformed nuclei. The quantum number\nK is (in units of \\) the projection of the nuclear angular mo-\nmentum on the symmetry axis of the nucleus (see box 2).\nThe decay of isomers by electromagnetic transitions of mul-\ntipole order lower than DK, the difference in K between ini-\ntial and final states, requires a mixing of K values in either\nstate. This K mixing need only have a small influence on\nthe wave function to produce a dominant effect on the rates\nof otherwise forbidden de-excitation transitions.\nThree distinct mechanisms have been proposed for the\nrequisite K mixing. First, there is Coriolis-force mixing in\nthe noninertial rest frame of the rotating nucleus. One can\nview the Coriolis effect as causing fluctuations in the ori-\nentation of the nucleus without any fluctuation in its\nshape. Second, because K conservation depends on axial\nsymmetry, asymmetric wavefunction components can in-\nstigate K mixing. That effect is equivalent to nuclear shape\nfluctuations with orientation fixed. Finally, there is sta-\ntistical mixing: Quantum states of the same spin and par-\nity, but different K, can mix significantly by virtue of for-\ntuitous near-degeneracies between their energies. Such\naccidental degeneracies become more common with \nincreasing density of energy levels. And the level density,\nin turn, grows with excitation energy.\nEach of the three K-mixing mechanisms, on its own,\nhas had some success in fitting the isomer data.7 But a uni-\nfied approach has yet to be developed, and the relative im-\nportance of the different mechanisms remains to be deter-\nmined. The situation leaves the prediction of some isomer\nhalf-lives uncertain by many orders of magnitude.\nInducing premature decay\nLet\u2019s return to our opening question about clean energy\nsources. A special feature of nuclear isomers is that they\ncarry excess energy. And that energy can be released\nthrough the electromagnetic interaction. Indeed, the en-\nergy release can be induced by photon bombardment. In\nother words, one can shorten the isomer\u2019s decay time and\nthus release the excitation energy in a controlled manner.\nThat much is well established. For example, the 1015-\nyear isomer 180mTa can be converted to the 8-hour b-de-\ncaying  180Ta ground state by photon bombardment, a\nprocess that has been studied in detail.1,13 But unfortu-\nhttp:\/\/www.physicstoday.org June 2005    Physics Today 43\nBox 2. K Isomers\nT\nhe orientation of a deformed isomer\u2019s spin relative to the\nsymmetry axis can strongly affect its half-life. Nuclei with\nmagic (closed-shell) neutron or proton numbers of 2, 8, 20,\n28, 50, 82, or 126 (see figure 2) are more or less spherical in\ntheir ground states and low-energy excitations. But far away\nfrom closed shells, the shape is typically prolate, with well-\ndefined symmetry about the long axis (see the illustration at\nright). A prolate nucleus can rotate collectively, but quantum\nmechanics forbids collective rotation about an axis of cylin-\ndrical symmetry. The total angular momentum of the nucleus\nis a vector sum of contributions from collective rotation and\norbits of unpaired nucleons. Whatever their relative contri-\nbutions, the total angular momentum\u2019s component K\\ along\nthe symmetry axis is a constant of the motion.\nIn the noninertial rotating reference frame, however, K is\nnot strictly conserved, primarily because of the Coriolis effect. Just as cyclones\u2014another Coriolis manifestation\u2014have their\nangular momenta aligned with Earth\u2019s axis, nucleon orbits tend to become aligned with the nuclear rotation. The result is a\nmixing of different K states.\nThe K quantum number introduces a nuclear-transition selection rule based on the direction as well as the magnitude of\nthe angular momentum: In an electromagnetic de-excitation transition, the change in K should not exceed l, the transition\nmultipole order. Transitions that violate this condition are called K-forbidden. The drawing above illustrates a K-forbidden\ndipole (l = 1) transition between prolate J = 8 nuclear states. In the initial K = 8 orientation, the angular momentum can be\naligned with the symmetry axis because it arises completely from unpaired nucleon orbits rather than collective rotation. But\nin the lower-energy K = 0 orientation, the J = 8 angular momentum is entirely from collective rotation.\nRather than being strictly forbidden, such transitions are severely hindered. The result is long-lived excitation states\u2014that\nis, nuclear isomers. These \u201cK isomers\u201d form a distinct class of isomers in axially symmetric deformed nuclei. Their distribution\nin the N-Z plane of neutron and proton numbers (see figure 4), clustered around the 31-year isomer of hafnium-178, is quite\ndistinct from the two clusters of closed-shell (spin-trap) isomers near N = 82 and Z = 82.\nSymmetry\naxis\nK = 0\nK = 8\nForbidden\n= 1 transition lnately, the energy of the incident\nphoton that liberates the isomer\u2019s\n77-keV excitation energy has to\nexceed an MeV! Although this g-\ninduced de-excitation has interest-\ning astrophysical implications, it\nhardly seems like the basis for a\npractical energy-storage device.\nThe scientific interest in such\nmatters entered a new and con-\ntroversial phase following claims\nmade in 1999 that 178m2Hf could re-\nlease its 2.4 MeV of stored energy\nwhen bombarded by x-ray photons\nwith energies of less than 100 keV.\nIf such triggering were indeed pos-\nsible at a reasonable rate, the\npractical implications could have\nbeen major.\nThe ensuing complex story of\nclaims and counterclaims has\nbeen told in an article by one of\nus14 and in the May 2004 PHYSICS\nTODAY news story cited above. We\ndon\u2019t wish to repeat those argu-\nments here. Suffice it to say that\nthe original claims have not been\nconfirmed to the satisfaction of the\nnuclear physics community. There\nare ongoing efforts to quantify the\nphoton de-excitation of 178m2Hf.\nThe physics of isomer interaction\nwith the radiation field implies\nthat the de-excitation will almost\ncertainly be possible at some pho-\nton energy. But that threshold en-\nergy, while of scientific interest,\nwill very likely be too high to be of practical use. Of course,\nother isomers may prove themselves useful.\nOne can consider, for example, the possibility of stim-\nulated emission from isomers, and even the construction\nof a g-ray laser based on isomer decay. Line broadening,\nthe most critical impediment to isomer lasing, might per-\nhaps be overcome by exploiting the M\u00f6ssbauer effect. But\nmany other difficulties remain.15 Nevertheless, the poten-\ntial applications of isomers are widespread, and a better \nunderstanding of the processes that control their decay\nmay lead to key advances.\nThe atomic environment can have a large effect on \nnuclear decay rates\u2014for example, through the electron-\nconversion process. To take an extreme case: If all the elec-\ntrons were stripped from a 178Hf atom while its nucleus was\nin the Jp \u2282 16\u2295 isomeric state, its half-life would increase\nfrom the usual 31 years to 105 years. More promising for\napplications, of course, are techniques for hastening iso-\nmer decay. For example, a 20% half-life reduction has been\ndemonstrated16 for highly stripped ions of an isomer of\niron-57. Less dramatic is the recently discovered 1% short-\nening of the ground-state half-life of 7Be when the atoms\nare caged within C60 buckeyballs.17 The sensitivity of \nnuclear decay to the atomic environment gives hope that\nmixed atomic\u2013nuclear effects may eventually provide a\nway to induce energy release from isomers.\nExploiting the practical promise of isomers will re-\nquire a much improved understanding of their basic prop-\nerties. Theorists Wojciech Satula (University of Warsaw)\nand Ramon Wyss (Royal Institute of Technology, Stock-\nholm) have reviewed the considerable recent progress in\nthe understanding of high-spin nuclear excitations.18 For\nthe experimental progress of nuclear physics, isomers are\nexcellent tools for accessing species far from the valley of\nstability, particularly for the study of neutron-rich heavy\nnuclides, and even superheavy nuclides.\nReferences\n1.
