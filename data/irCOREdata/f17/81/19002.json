Some oligomeric transcription factors,\nsuch as the homeodomain protein SatB1, have been\nshown to serve as architectural proteins that provide scaf-\nfolds for the recruitment of multiple chromatin binding\nproteins including co-activators and co-repressors. SatB1\nin conjunction with these partner proteins allows speci\ufb01c\nDNA looping events which form a chromatin landscape\nthat facilitates the activation or repression of speci\ufb01c genes\n(2,3). However, very few proteins of this type have been\ncharacterized in any detail and the relationship between\nprotein oligomerization and the formation of chromatin\ndomains is still poorly understood.\nThe Proline-Rich Homeodomain protein (PRH, also\nknown as HHex) is an essential transcription factor in\nvertebrate embryonic development and in the adult (4,5).\nIn the developing embryo, PRH regulates body-axis for-\nmation and the formation of multiple tissues including the\nliver, pancreas, heart and thyroid, the vasculature and the\nhaematopoietic system. In the adult, PRH regulates\nmultiple steps in haematopoiesis and controls cell\ngrowth. Mutations that result in the mis-expression or\nmis-localization of PRH are associated with leukaemia\nas well as thyroid and breast cancers (6\u20138). In addition,\na fusion protein between nucleoporin protein Nup98 and\nPRH (Nup-Hex\/PRH) that is thought to antagonize\nthe activity of wild-type PRH results in myeloid\nleukaemia (9).\nPRH can repress or activate gene expression but when\nbound directly to DNA, this protein generally appears to\nfunction as a repressor of transcription (10\u201312). We have\nshown that PRH recruits members of the TLE family of\nchromatin binding proteins in order to repress transcrip-\ntion and that it brings about nuclear retention and\nhyperphosphorylation of TLE proteins (10,13). PRH is a\nphosphoprotein in cells and phosphorylation by CK2\ninhibits the DNA binding activity and transcriptional\nrepression functions of this protein (14). We have used\nin vivo cross-linking to show that PRH forms oligomeric\nassemblies in cells (15). The puri\ufb01ed recombinant PRH\nprotein also forms oligomeric assemblies and using ana-\nlytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and gel \ufb01ltration\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The protein\ndoes not appear to form monomers or any other\nmultimers smaller than an octamer (15). The oligomeric\ncomplexes formed by the recombinant protein bind to\nPRH-interacting proteins such as CK2b and the puri\ufb01ed\noligomer is capable of speci\ufb01c binding to the promoter\nregions of its target genes in vitro (14,16). Moreover, the\nrecombinant protein can be phosphorylated by CK2 to\nblock DNA binding and then dephosphorylated to\nrestore DNA binding (14). These experiments show that\nthe puri\ufb01ed oligomeric PRH protein is functional (14,15).\nFurther, each homeodomain in the octameric complex is\ncapable of binding to DNA and the PRH protein binds\nwith high af\ufb01nity to arrays of multiple core homeodomain\nbinding sites (16). As might be expected based on these\nresults, several PRH target genes, including the Goosecoid\ngene (16) and the Vegfr-1 and Vegfr-2 receptor genes (17),\ncontain clustered arrays of sites that mediate PRH\nbinding. When bound to its binding sites in the\nGoosecoid promoter, PRH oligomers induce signi\ufb01cant\nDNA distortion (16).\nThe PRH protein is 270 amino acids in length and\nconsists of three regions: a proline-rich N-terminal tran-\nscription repression domain (residues 1\u2013136), a central\nDNA binding homeodomain (137\u2013197) and an acidic\nC-terminal domain (198\u2013270) [Figure 1(a)]. The \ufb01rst 46\namino acids of PRH form a novel dimerization motif,\nwhile amino acids downstream of residue 46 are\nrequired for oligomerization. The region between amino\nacids 46 and 132 is capable of interacting with the PRH\nhomeodomain and this interaction is probably important\nduring oligomerization (15). Here, we show using AUC\nthat PRH forms discrete disc-shaped octameric complexes\nand more spherical double octamers (hexadecamers)\nas well as larger multimers. We show that PRH\nhexadecamers bind to DNA in an ordered fashion, result-\ning in PRH\u2013DNA polymers that differ by one repeat unit.\nWe demonstrate using linear dichroism (LD) and electron\nmicroscopy (EM) that when PRH oligomers bind to their\nsites they signi\ufb01cantly compact the DNA and form protein\narrays or \ufb01bres on the DNA.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProtein used in this study\nRecombinant full-length PRH protein, the PRH F32E\nmutant and the truncated PRH homeodomain protein\nwere puri\ufb01ed as described previously (18,19). The\nfull-length PRH protein runs as a monomer on\nnon-reducing sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicating that there\nare no interchain disulphide bonds (data not shown).\nProtein concentrations were determined from the A280nm\nusing the molar extinction coef\ufb01cients.\nDNAs used in this study\nThe mammalian expression plasmid pMUG1-Myc-PRH\nexpresses Myc-tagged human PRH (amino acids 7\u2013270)\nand has been described previously (20).\npMUG1-Myc-PRH F32E and pMUG1-Myc-PRH\nN187A express mutated PRH proteins that fail to bind\nTLE co-repressor proteins and DNA respectively (10).\nshRNA plasmids shRNAPRH49, shRNAPRH51 and\nthe control shRNA plasmid were obtained from\nOrigene. The pSV-b-galactosidase control reporter\n(pSV-lacZ) was obtained from Promega. The pTKmin-\nPRH reporter plasmid has been described previously and\ncontains \ufb01ve PRH binding sites cloned upstream of the\nminimal thymidine kinase promoter and \ufb01re\ufb02y luciferase\ngene in pTKmin (20). The Goosecoid reporter plasmid\npGL2-GSC contains DNA sequences from \u0002461 to +64\nrelative to the Goosecoid transcription start point cloned\nupstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-basic\n(Promega) and has been described previously (16). The\npGL2-Gsc-PRHx5 plasmid contains \ufb01ve PRH binding\nsites cloned in the enhancer position around 2 kbp\nupstream of the Goosecoid promoter. This construct\nwas made by excising \ufb01ve tandemly arranged PRH\nbinding sites from pBS-prh5x (5) using XbaI and\nHindIII. The fragment containing PRH sites was then\ntreated with Klenow enzyme to produce blunt ends and\ncloned into the unique BamHI site in pGL2-Gsc plasmid,\nwhich had also been treated with Klenow enzyme to\nproduce blunt ends. The pGL2-HS1 reporter contains\nthe human Surf-1\/2 bidirectional promoter cloned\nupstream of the luciferase gene (21,22). The\npGL2-HS1-PRHx5 plasmid contains \ufb01ve PRH binding\nsites cloned in the enhancer position upstream of the\nSurf-1\/2 promoter and was produced exactly as described\nfor pGL2-Gsc-PRHx5. Plasmid pGL2-PRHx5 contains\nthe same \ufb01ve PRH binding sites cloned in the enhancer\nposition with no promoter and was made as above. All\nconstructs were veri\ufb01ed by DNA sequencing. DNA con-\ncentrations were determined from their absorbance at\n260 nM and con\ufb01rmed by comparison to known DNA\nsamples using agarose gel electrophoresis.\nDNA for AUC was puri\ufb01ed by CsCl gradient centrifu-\ngation. A 267-bp DNA fragment carrying a cluster of\nPRH binding sites from the Goosecoid promoter was\nprepared by digesting of 250mg of pGL2-GSC with\n900U of BanI for 16 h at 37\u0003C yielding around 2.7mg\nof the required fragment and several larger digestion\nproducts. All of the DNA fragments were applied to a\nMonoQ column and eluted with a salt gradient. The\n267-bp Goosecoid fragment elutes at 750mM NaCl salt\nfree from the other DNA fragments.\nEM\nSamples were placed on a carbon-coated copper EM grid\nand stained with 1% uranyl acetate before examination in\na Jeol JEM 2011 transmission EM equipped with an LaB6\n\ufb01lament as an electron source.

Velocity experiments for His-PRH\nprotein were carried out at three loading concentrations\n(2, 6 and 12 mM). The radial distribution of His-PRH\nprotein at sedimentation was monitored by absorbance\nas a function of time at either A280 for high protein con-\ncentrations or A230 at low (2 mM) concentration. The dis-\ntribution of sedimentation coef\ufb01cients was obtained using\nthe program ULTRASCAN employing the enhanced Van\nHolde\u2013Wischet analysis. Using the calculated values for\nthe molecular weight of His-PRH (34.6 kDa), the partial\nspeci\ufb01c volume of the protein (\u0002=0.7216ml\/g), and the\nbuffer density \u0003=1.0317, and taking the relationship\nS=M (1 \u2013 \u0002\u0003)\/Nf, where N is Avagadro\u2019s number, a\nmolecule of this mass will have a sedimentation coef\ufb01cient\nof 2S if its frictional ratio is f\/fo of 1.3 (fo is the frictional\ncoef\ufb01cient of an anhydrous sphere with the same mass and\na frictional ratio f\/fo of 1.3 is typical for proteins with an\nellipsoidal shape).

Transiently transfections were per-\nformed by electroporation (270V\/950mF). The cells were\nco-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids\ndescribed earlier and either the PRH expression vector\npMUG1-Myc-PRH or the empty pMUG1 vector. The\nb-galactosidase reporter plasmid pSV-lacZ was also\nco-transfected into the cells to act as a control for trans-\nfection ef\ufb01ciency. Twenty-four hours post-transfection,\nluciferase activity was determined using the Promega\nLuciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Promega) and b-galactosidase assays were\nperformed using the same lysates.

Transcription\nassays were then performed by re-transfecting the cells\nexactly as described above.

ChIP was carried out exactly as before (16) using\nprimers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions\nalso described previously (17). Quantitative reverse tran-\nscription (RT)-PCR was performed exactly as described\npreviously (17). The amount of Vegfr-1 product was\ndetermined relative to product from input chromatin\nand compared to gapdh as an internal reference.\nRESULTS\nPRH octamers are oblate spheroids that self-associate\nWe have shown previously that the isolated PRH\nhomeodomain is a monomer in solution, whereas the\nfull-length PRH protein forms large oligomers in\nsolution and in cells (15). These oligomers are not the\nresult of non-physiological protein aggregation as they\nare soluble, capable of binding to PRH-interacting\nproteins and capable of binding to DNA containing\nPRH sites (14,15,18). To better characterize PRH\noligomeric species, we performed AUC SV experiments\nat different protein concentrations and centrifugation\nspeeds. Oligomeric PRH comprises species with sedimen-\ntation coef\ufb01cients of 9S and 25S as well as multiple species\nwith sedimentation coef\ufb01cients larger than 40S\n[Figure 1(b)]. According to Stokes equation, the Ssphere\nof a PRH octamer is 15S, which is the maximum sedimen-\ntation coef\ufb01cient value for a protein with a mass of\n280 kDa and translational frictional coef\ufb01cient value, \u01920,\nof 8.1411\u0004 10\u00028. Thus, the 25S species cannot represent a\nPRH octamer and as we previously reported, the smallest\nof these species (9S) most likely corresponds to a PRH\noctamer (15). Using the Svedberg equation the 9S\nspecies are calculated to have a translational frictional co-\nef\ufb01cient, \u0192, of 1.4447\u0004 10\u00027, based on the calculated\npartial speci\ufb01c volume of PRH (0.7216ml\/g) and the\ncalculated density of water at 20\u0003C (\u0003=0.998). The fric-\ntional ratio, \u0192\/\u01920, of proteins provides an estimate of their\nshape; a ratio of 1 suggests that the protein is completely\nspherical, whereas ratios >1 suggest that the protein may\nbe more elongated. The frictional ratio, \u0192\/\u01920 of the 9S\nPRH species in water at 20\u0003C is 1.7. This value corres-\nponds to a highly oblate spheroid with an axial ratio of\n19.7, diameters of around 100 A\u02da and 20 A\u02da and a volume of\n3.6\u0004 105 A\u02da3. In contrast, the 25S species shown in\nFigure 1(b) has a translational frictional coef\ufb01cient, \u0192, of\n1.0257\u0004 107 and an \u0192\/\u01920 ratio of 1 which suggests that\nthese particles adopt a roughly spherical shape. Using\nthe Svedberg equation, the 25S species molecular weight\nwas determined to be 560 kDa, which correlates precisely\nwith the calculated molecular weight of two 9S PRH\noctamers. These spherical particles have a calculated\ndiameter of 108 A\u02da and a volume of 6.7\u0004 105 A\u02da3. This\nvolume is very close to the estimated volume of two\nPRH octamers (\u00056.5\u0004 105 A\u02da3), which further supports\nthe idea that two 9S oblate particles come together to\nform these 25S roughly spherical particles. The multiple\nspecies larger than 40S have \u0192\/\u01920 ratios, which average at\n3.3, suggesting elongated structures. These PRH species\nhave molecular weights in excess of 1mDa, which\nsuggests polymerized forms of PRH.

Importantly, we could not\ndetect any differences in the amount of each species\nwhen the sample was diluted across a 10-fold range, sug-\ngesting that there is a non-reversible association of 9S\noctameric particles to form the larger assemblies.\nThis sample of PRH protein was also characterized\nusing negative stain and transmission EM. Under EM,\nPRH appears to form spherical particles of \u0005150\u2013200-A\u02da\ndiameter as well as much larger particles formed by the\nself-association of the smaller spheres [Figure 1(c)]. It is\nworth noting that the accumulation of negative stain itself\n4 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010\n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 14, 2011\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nwill tend to increase the apparent size of the particles\nobserved under EM. The size of the smallest spherical\nparticles observed under EM (\u0005150 A\u02da) thus seems to be\nof the same magnitude as the calculated large diameter of\nthe 9S oblate spheroids (around 100 A\u02da) and the 25S\nspheres (108 A\u02da), suggesting that both species could be\npresent but indistinguishable when visualized from\nabove. However, it is also possible that the negative\nstain technique may favour the adherence of some forms\nof PRH over others on the coated EM grid. We collected\nseveral hundred images of individual oligomers and rep-\nresentative views, which are shown in Figure 1(c).\nAlthough the majority of single particles are round,\nsome of the oligomers appear to be oval, suggesting that\nthey represent 9S particles that are visualized at an angle.\nWe conclude that the 9S, 25S and larger species\ncharacterized above using AUC are representative of the\nPRH species found under these conditions using EM and\nthat the data are consistent with oblate 9S octameric\nspheroids coming together to form roughly spherical 25S\nhexadecameric species.\nPRH\u2013DNA complexes self-associate in solution\nPRH binds to short oligonucleotides carrying a single\nPRH site with a stoichiometry of 7.3 DNA fragments to\n1 PRH octamer, suggesting that each homeodomain\nwithin the octamer is capable of binding to DNA (16).\nPRH binds with high co-operativity to DNA fragments\ncontaining multiple PRH binding sites and several PRH\nresponsive genes contain closely spaced arrays of PRH\nbinding sites (16,17). We have previously demonstrated\nthat PRH is able to bind to short oligonucleotides con-\ntaining PRH binding sites in SV experiments (15). This\ntechnique has the potential to provide detailed informa-\ntion on the nature of the PRH\u2013DNA complexes contain-\ning longer DNA fragments with multiple PRH binding\nsites. However, in order to perform these experiments,\nwe require large quantities of a suitable DNA fragment\ncarrying multiple PRH sites. To this end, we chose a\n267-bp DNA fragment carrying a cluster of PRH\nbinding sites from the Goosecoid promoter that confers\ntranscriptional regulation by PRH in cells [Figure 2(a)].\nShorter DNA fragments might not contain a suf\ufb01cient\nnumber of PRH sites, while the hydrodynamic properties\nof longer DNA fragments precludes their use in SV ex-\nperiments. The 267-bp Goosecoid DNA fragment was\nobtained by restriction enzyme digestion and puri\ufb01ed\nusing ion exchange chromatography. PRH and PRH\u2013\nDNA complexes were detected by their absorption at\n260 nm using SV at centrifugation speeds chosen to best\ndetect the sedimentation of DNA alone as well as the sedi-\nmentation of PRH\u2013DNA complexes. Figure 2(b) shows\nthat a single sedimentation boundary is visible for the\n267-bp DNA fragment alone, which has a sedimentation\ncoef\ufb01cient of \u00056S. The frictional ratio \u0192\/\u01920 of this DNA is\n3.4, suggesting as expected a highly elongated molecule.\nThe apparent molecular weight is 177 kDa, which is in\ngood agreement with the calculated molecular weight of\n166 kDa. When PRH is bound to this DNA, a second\nsedimentation boundary is detected that corresponds to\na PRH\u2013DNA complex with a sedimentation coef\ufb01cient\nof 42S. When SV experiments were repeated with slower\nsedimentation speeds, increased amounts of this 42S\ncomplex were observed and in addition a number of add-\nitional discrete sedimentation boundaries were also\nobserved having sedimentation coef\ufb01cients of 63S, 77S,\n90S and 102S as well as some larger species\n[Figure 2(c)]. In order to determine the probable nature\nof these complexes, we extensively modelled possible\nprotein\u2013DNA complexes and calculated the Ssphere of\neach complex. The molecular weight was calculated for\neach potential protein\u2013DNA complex (theoretical mass\nfor 1 PRH octamer plus 1 DNA, 1 PRH octamer plus\ntwo DNAs, one PRH octamer plus three DNAs. . .two\nPRH octamers plus one DNA, two PRH octamers plus\ntwo DNAs, two PRH octamers plus three DNAs, etc.)\nand used to calculate the maximum Ssphere value for\neach potential protein\u2013DNA complex. This approach\nallows us to rule out complexes that could not form the\nobserved species [such as one PRH octamer plus one\nDNA (Ssphere 26S), two octamers plus one DNA (Ssphere\n33S), etc]. The data are summarized in Table 1 for the\nsubset of complexes that are in good agreement with the\nobserved S values (Sobs). The observed and calculated\nvalues for a series of double octamers each bound to\ntwo DNA fragments are in good agreement assuming\nthat the oligomers deviate somewhat from a linear organ-\nization as they grow [as shown in the model in\nFigure 2(d)]. We conclude that in the presence of DNA,\nPRH oligomers organize themselves into discrete nucleo-\nprotein complexes that differ in sedimentation coef\ufb01cient\nby a discrete repeat unit consistent with a double octamer\nbound to two 267-bp DNA fragments. Although we could\nnot \ufb01t any other models to the data, this analysis cannot\nexclude the possibility that the complexes do not associate\nin this manner. It is also not possible to determine whether\nthe regular sedimentation pro\ufb01le for the PRH\u2013DNA\ncomplexes is caused by the disruption of pre-existing\nPRH assemblies that then bind DNA or whether\npre-existing PRH assemblies simply bind DNA to form\nlarger complexes.\nPRH can form protein\u2013DNA \ufb01bres\nTo gain a better understanding of the nature of the\nhigher-order PRH\u2013DNA complexes described earlier, we\nincubated PRH oligomers with a 525-bp fragment of\nDNA encompassing the same array of Goosecoid PRH\nbinding sites used in the previous experiments\n[Figure 3(a)] and viewed negatively stained samples\nusing EM [Figure 3(b)]. In the presence of this DNA\nfragment, bead-like objects are visible and they associate\nin a side-by-side manner [Figure 3(b)]. Naked DNA\nprovides very low contrast in transmission EM. Hence,\nas would be expected, in the absence of PRH protein\nuranyl acetate stained DNA alone is barely visible. At\nlow numbers of \u2018beads\u2019, these assemblies are very similar\nto the model shown in Figure 2(d). As the number of\n\u2018beads\u2019 increases, complex assemblies are formed that\nappear mesh like.

Molecules are oriented in solution in\none direction by rotation in a Couette. The absorbance of\nlinearly polarized light parallel and perpendicular to an\norientation direction, by directionally oriented molecules,\nis measured and the difference in the absorbances results\nin an LD signal. In the case of DNA, the difference in\nabsorbance of linearly polarized light (at 260 nm), in\nparallel and perpendicular directions, by electrons of\nthe DNA bases is the negative minimum. This indi-\ncates that the bases lie in a more perpendicular than par-\nallel orientation to the DNA helix axis. Proteins that\nbind to DNA alter the LD signal in a speci\ufb01c way, result-\ning in an increased or a decreased negative LD signal\nat 260 nm together with LD signals arising from\nthe protein itself. Protein \ufb01bres containing aromatic\nresidues such as tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalan-\nine can give LD signals at 280 nm, but the strongest of\nthese signals emanate from absorbance by the pep-\ntide backbone chromophore and are in the far UV\n(190\u2013220 nm).\nWe used LD to examine the binding of PRH and the\nisolated PRH homeodomain to the linearized 6 kbp\nplasmid DNA that contains the Goosecoid promoter\nand the linearized empty vector [Figure 4(a), lines 1 and\n2]. LD signals were recorded for DNA alone or DNA in\nthe presence of PRH proteins. Figure 4(b) shows that the\n260-nm LD signal for the plasmid lacking Goosecoid se-\nquences becomes less negative upon incubation with the\nisolated PRH homeodomain (PRH\u2013HD). This LD signal\nchange indicates that the DNA bases are less perpendicu-\nlar to the helical axis in the presence of PRH\u2013HD and\ntherefore that PRH\u2013HD has increased DNA \ufb02exibility.\nThis suggests that PRH\u2013HD binds to ATTA-like se-\nquences in the plasmid and\/or possesses high non-speci\ufb01c\nDNA-binding activity. In contrast, the negative LD signal\nfor this empty vector plasmid DNA does not alter in the\npresence of full-length PRH [Figure 4(c)]. These data\nsuggest that, as might be expected, the full-length\noligomeric PRH protein has increased DNA-binding spe-\nci\ufb01city compared to the isolated homeodomain.\nThe negative LD signal for the plasmid carrying\nGoosecoid DNA sequences becomes more intensely\nnegative in the presence of PRH\u2013HD [Figure 4(d)] in a\nprotein concentration-dependent manner. An increased\nLD signal indicates that the DNA is aligning to a higher\ndegree. This is the result of the DNA becoming more rigid.\nThis suggests that PRH\u2013HD alters the \ufb02exibility\/conform-\nation of DNA when bound to its speci\ufb01c binding sites and\nbrings about a more rigid DNA helix. The negative LD\nsignal for this DNA is signi\ufb01cantly reduced in intensity by\nfull-length PRH [Figure 4(e)]. This signal is further\ndecreased when more PRH protein is present, that is, at\nhigher PRH:DNA ratios. Given that there is no effect of\nPRH on the DNA lacking Goosecoid sequences, we inter-\npret the decreased negative LD signal in the presence of\nPRH sites as resulting from signi\ufb01cant bending or com-\npaction of the DNA by PRH in a manner opposite to that\nproduced on speci\ufb01c binding of PRH\u2013HD. It is also\nobserved that the maximum at 230 nm increases until it\nbecomes positive. This is likely to be the result of signals\nfrom the peptide backbone of the protein becoming visible\nas they become aligned as when bound to the aligned\nDNA. In conclusion, full-length PRH appears to\ncompact\/bend DNA when its binding sites are present\nand shows little non-speci\ufb01c binding to DNA. In\ncontrast, PRH\u2013HD brings about some DNA bending or\nother conformational change when non-speci\ufb01cally bound\nto DNA but when bound to speci\ufb01c sites it appears to\nmake the DNA more rigid. We infer that regions outside\nthe homeodomain contribute both to speci\ufb01c DNA\nbinding and to compaction of the DNA associated with\nspeci\ufb01c binding.\nMultiple clusters of PRH binding sites increase DNA\ncompaction\nTo determine whether the presence of additional PRH\nbinding sites in pGL2-Gsc would result in further DNA\ncompaction, we cloned an array of PRH binding sites into\nthis construct and the empty pGL2 vector. Plasmid\npGL2-Gsc-PRHx5 contains an array of \ufb01ve PRH\nbinding sites identi\ufb01ed in SELEX experiments (5) cloned\n3 kb away from the existing array of PRH sites in the\nGoosecoid promoter [Figure 4(a), line 3]. These sites are\nwell characterized and are known to be bound by PRH in\nboth electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and\nreporter assays (10,20). Plasmid pGL2-PRHx5 contains\nthe same array of \ufb01ve PRH sites but lacks the\nGoosecoid promoter. LD signals were recorded for\nDNA alone or DNA in the presence of PRH or PRH\nHD as described earlier. As seen with the plasmid contain-\ning the Goosecoid promoter sequences, the negative LD\nsignal for pGL2-PRHx5 decreases in the presence of\nfull-length PRH, although in this case, the change is\nonly pronounced at 450-nM PRH (data not shown).\nThis con\ufb01rms that PRH binds to these sites under these\nconditions [and as shown previously using other methods\n(5,16)]. The negative LD signal for pGL2-Gsc-PRHx5 is\nincreased in the presence of PRH\u2013HD and the increase\ndepends upon the protein concentration [Figure 4(f)].\nThe negative LD signal for pGL2-Gsc-PRHx5 is\ndecreased in the presence of full-length PRH\n[Figure 4(g)]. However, at a low PRH concentration\nthere is little change in the negative signal and possibly\neven an increase in the negative signal. We attribute this\nto the fact that the effective PRH:speci\ufb01c site DNA ratio\nis lower when there are two binding site arrays within\nthe plasmid competing for speci\ufb01c binding by PRH.\nAt higher PRH concentrations, additional LD maxima\noccur in the region of the far UV (230 nm) and at\n\u0005280 nm and these accompany a signi\ufb01cant reduction in\nthe amplitude of the negative LD signal for DNA\n(260 nm) [Figure 4(g)]. These results suggest that speci\ufb01c\nDNA binding by PRH compacts pGL2-Gsc-PRHx5 to a\ngreater extent than that seen with pGL-Gsc or\npGL2-PRHx5. Furthermore, the LD maximum in the\nfar UV suggests that PRH oligomers associate to form\nan organized PRH \ufb01bre on the DNA, in which proteins\nbecome aligned, and hence, produces an overlying LD\nspectrum containing signals from backbone and\nside-chain chromophores.\n8 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010\n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 14, 2011\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nDNA compaction by PRH does not result in\ntranscriptional repression\nThe above-described experiments indicate that the\npresence of an array of PRH binding sites results\nin DNA compaction and the formation a repetitive\nPRH\u2013DNA \ufb01bre in vitro.

To test these possibilities we transi-\nently transfected a series of reporter plasmids containing\nvarying numbers of PRH sites and different promoter se-\nquences into mammalian cells and examined the effects of\nPRH on their activity. We made use of K562 cells for\nthese experiments because these cells express PRH en-\ndogenously. The luciferase reporter plasmids shown in\nFigure 5(a) were transiently co-transfected into K562\ncells along with a plasmid expressing b-galactosidase\nthat is used as a control for variations in transfection ef-\n\ufb01ciency. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells\nwere harvested and the relative promoter activity\ncalculated in each case by dividing the luciferase activity\nby the b-galactosidase activity. As expected, based on our\npreviously published results, when an array of \ufb01ve PRH\nbinding sites is present upstream of the minimal thymidine\nkinase promoter (TKmin-PRH), relative promoter activity\nis signi\ufb01cantly reduced [Figure 5(b), compare columns 1\nand 2]. We interpret this reduction in relative promoter\nactivity to be due to endogenous PRH proteins binding to\nthe PRH binding sites in the reporter and bringing about\nthe repression of transcription. In order to con\ufb01rm, this\nwe repeated this experiment in K562 cells in which en-\ndogenous PRH has been knocked down using shRNA\n[as shown in Figure 5(c)]. In the PRH knock down cells,\nthe relative promoter activities produced by the TKmin\nand TKmin-PRH constructs are not signi\ufb01cantly different\n[Figure 5(b), columns 3 and 4].\nHaving established that endogenous PRH in K562 cells\nis able to bind to a reporter plasmid containing an array of\nPRH sites and repress transcription, we next compared the\nrelative promoter activity of the pGL2-Gsc and\npGL2-Gsc-PRHx5 constructs described earlier. These\nreporter constructs have almost identical relative\npromoter activity in K562 cells [Figure 5(d), columns 3\nand 4] despite the fact that pGL2-Gsc-PRHx5 contains\nmore PRH sites and is more condensed by PRH in vitro\nas determined using LD. To investigate this further, we\nrepeated this experiment in the presence of over-expressed\nPRH. Co-transfection of these reporters into K562 cells\nalong with a plasmid that over-expresses PRH results in a\nsigni\ufb01cant reduction in relative promoter activity in both\ncases [Figure 5(d), columns 5 and 6]. However, the reduc-\ntion in promoter activity brought about by PRH\nover-expression is very similar for both reporters. We\nconclude that the presence of additional PRH sites does\nnot result in additional transcriptional repression. To de-\ntermine whether this is more generally the case, we created\nreporter constructs in which the array of \ufb01ve PRH sites\ndescribed earlier is placed upstream of the human Surf-1\n(HS1) promoter in a distal position [Figure 5(a), lines 5\nand 6]. The HS1 promoter is a well-characterized\nTATA-less housekeeping promoter that does not contain\nany sequences that resemble the PRH core binding site\n(21,25,26). Transient co-transfection of this reporter\nplasmid and an HS1 reporter plasmid lacking PRH\nbinding sites into K562 cells result in the same amount\nof relative promoter activity in each case [Figure 5(d),\ncolumns 7 and 8]. This demonstrates that the presence\nof an array of PRH sites does not always result in the\nrepression of transcription and suggests that other\nfactors such as co-repressor recruitment or core\npromoter structure are important in determining\nwhether PRH is able to represses transcription from a\nnearby promoter.\nTo investigate this in a setting in which the relative con-\ntribution to repression from co-repressor recruitment and\nDNA compaction can be determined, we made use of a\nPRH mutant that fails to bind TLE co-repressor proteins.\nPRH F32E carries a mutation that blocks binding to TLE\nproteins and blocks co-repression in cells (10,13). We \ufb01rst\ncompared the ability of wild-type PRH and PRH F32E to\nbind to a PRH target gene in cells using quantitative\nChIP. The Vegfr-1 gene is directly repressed by PRH in\nK562 cells (17). Both PRH and PRH F32E bind to\nVegfr-1 promoter sequences in a ChIP assay\n[Figure 5(e)]. In contrast, a DNA binding defective PRH\nprotein (PRH N187A) fails to bind to the same Vegfr-1\nsequences. Quantitative RT-PCR shows that PRH\nrepresses Vegfr-1 mRNA levels in these cells, whereas\nPRH F32E has little or no effect [Figure 5(f)]. To\nexamine whether PRH F32E brings about DNA compac-\ntion, we puri\ufb01ed the protein and performed LD experi-\nments. Figure 5(g) shows that the F32E mutation has\nno effect on the ability of the mutant protein to bring\nabout DNA compaction. We conclude that DNA com-\npaction by PRH and transcriptional repression are separ-\nable events.\nDISCUSSION\nIn prokaryotes, DNA is packed into the nucleoid by a\nvariety of DNA binding proteins including H-NS, HU\nand the Lrp proteins (27). In many cases, these architec-\ntural proteins can also act as gene-speci\ufb01c transcription\nfactors regulating the expression of one or more genes.\nIn eukaryotes, architectural proteins include the histone\nproteins, the nuclear lamins and scaffolding factors such\nas SATB1 (28,29). However, the distinction between archi-\ntectural proteins and gene-speci\ufb01c transcription factors is\nagain not clear-cut, as some proteins that in\ufb02uence the\narchitecture of the genome also have effects on the expres-\nsion of speci\ufb01c genes. For example, mutations in the lamin\ngenes disrupt both nuclear organization and the expres-\nsion of individual genes (28). Conversely, proteins that\nhave gene-speci\ufb01c regulatory properties, such as the\nhomeodomain protein SatB1, can also have more global\nroles in the architecture of chromatin (2). Architectural\nDNA binding proteins can be divided into those that\nwrap DNA around themselves to form nucleosome-like\nstructures, those that bind to distantly spaced sites on\nDNA to form bridges and those that introduce DNA\nbending (27). The nucleosome is the paradigm for DNA\nwrapping and consists of around 150 bp of DNA wrapped\naround an octamer of histone proteins (30). Several\ngene-speci\ufb01c transcription factors are also thought to\nwrap DNA including the GAGA factor and the\nPolycomb nucleoprotein complex (31,32). However,\nthese proteins are not thought to form stable\nhomo-oligomers but rather act as monomers or other\nspecies that can self-associate and\/or form heteromeric\n10 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010\n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 14, 2011\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \npr\nom\no\nte\nr a\nct\niv\nity\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1        2         3        4\nTKmin +    - +    -\n- +     - +TKmin-PRH\nSVC sh PRH sh\nTkmin\nTkmin Luc \nTKminPRH\nTkmin Luc \nGSC\nGsc Luc \nHS1\nHS1 Luc \nGSC-PRHx5\nGsc Luc \nHS1-PRHx5 \nHS1 Luc \nLAMIN\nA\/C\n1       2\nPRH\nPR\nH\nsh\nRN\nA\nSV\nC\nsh\nRN\nA\nTk\nm\nin\nTK\nm\ninP\nRH GS\nC\nGS\nC-\nPR\nHx\n5\nHS\n1-P\nRH\nx5HS\n1\nGS\nC\n+\nPR\nH\nGS\nC-\nPR\nHx\n5 +\nPR\nH\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \npr\nom\no\nte\nr a\nct\niv\nity\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1       2       3        4       5        6       7        8\nFo\nld\n e\nnr\nic\nhm\nen\nt \nInput\nMyc ab\nIgG\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\nPRH F32E N187A\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1        2    3       \nPR\nH\nEV\nC\nF3\n2E\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \nm\nR\nN\nA\n le\nve\nls\nVegfr-1\nmRNA\n-3\n\u0394\nab\nso\nrb\nan\nce\n (x\n10\n3 )\n0\n-1\n-2\n1\nWavelength (nm)\npGL2-Gsc\nNo protein\nPRH\nPRH F32E \n(a) (b)\n(d)(c)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\nFigure 5.

We have shown previously that\nthese oligomers bind co-operatively to DNA sequences\ncontaining arrays of core PRH binding sites inducing a\nsigni\ufb01cant degree of DNA distortion (16). Here, we have\nshown that PRH oligomers compact DNA and form\nregular higher-order structures that likely correspond to\nprotein hexadecamers bound to \u0005500 bp of DNA. EM\nimages of the PRH\u2013DNA complexes suggest that PRH\nparticles bind to speci\ufb01c sites resulting in further protein\nself-association and the formation of a protein\u2013DNA\n\ufb01bre. DNA compaction therefore appears to be a conse-\nquence of the binding of large PRH oligomers to tandem\narrays of binding sites. In these respects, PRH seems to be\nvery different from the gene-speci\ufb01c transcription factors\ndescribed earlier. Whilst PRH forms closed oligomers that\nbind DNA and then further self-associate, several\nwell-characterized gene-speci\ufb01c transcription factors such\nas GAGA factor (32) and the bacterial MalT protein (33)\nappear to form open oligomers. These open oligomers can\nself-associate to build complexes which spread along\nDNA. In contrast, PRH appears to be able to spread\nalong DNA by the association of hexadecameric\nprotein\u2013DNA complexes. In this respect, PRH is similar\nto some members of the oligomeric Lrp\/AsnC family of\nproteins (34,35). These DNA binding proteins from\nbacteria and archaea form octamers and hexadecamers\nand are involved in both gene-speci\ufb01c transcriptional\nregulation and the global control of genome architecture.\nIn this protein family, DNA binding is mediated by an\nN-terminal helix\u2013turn\u2013helix (H\u2013T\u2013H) motif (which is\npreceded by an a-helix) and the proteins bind\nco-operatively to arrays of suitably spaced recognition\nsites inducing DNA wrapping (35). PRH contains a\ncentral homeodomain (H\u2013T\u2013H\u2013T\u2013H) and also forms\noctameric and hexadecameric oligomers. Furthermore,\nthe leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), the best\ncharacterized member of the family, forms disc-shaped\noligomers with a diameter of \u0005120 A\u02da (34,35). DNA is\nthought to wrap around the edges of two stacked LRP\ndiscs to form a nucleosome-like structure. This is again\nhighly reminiscent of the octameric discs and\nhexadecameric spheroids formed by PRH. Although the\nLrp\/AsnC proteins do not have known eukaryotic homo-\nlogues and PRH does not show sequence similarity to\nthese proteins, at least at low resolution, these proteins\nappear to be structural as well as functional homologues.\nOnce bound to DNA, PRH can bring about the repres-\nsion of transcription (10,20). Several PRH target genes\ncontain arrays of PRH core binding sites and the\nprotein binds tightly these arrays (16). Our data suggest\nthat PRH oligomers either (i) wrap DNA around them-\nselves in a manner similar to the nucleosome or (ii) spread\nalong DNA in a \ufb01bre-like fashion. In either case, the\nPRH\u2013DNA assemblies can further associate to form\nregular repeating units. In both cases, this might be\nexpected to contribute to the repression of transcription\nby steric hinderance (12). However, we have shown that\nthe presence of an array of PRH binding sites is not in\nitself suf\ufb01cient to bring about the repression of an\nadjacent promoter. Although an array of \ufb01ve PRH sites\nplaced upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase\npromoter is able to bring about transcriptional repression,\nthe same array of sites is unable to repress transcription\nwhen it is placed upstream of the HS1 promoter. As\nPRH-induced DNA condensation is brought about\nin vitro in both cases, this suggests that DNA condensa-\ntion alone is not suf\ufb01cient to bring about repression. In\nagreement with this conclusion, we have shown that\nincreased DNA condensation brought about by increasing\nthe number of PRH binding sites at a PRH repressible\npromoter does not result in increased transcriptional re-\npression. Furthermore, we have shown that a mutated\nPRH protein that is unable to recruit co-repressor\nproteins (PRH F32E) brings about DNA condensation\nin vitro, although it fails to repress transcription when\nbound to a PRH target gene in cells. In this regard,\nPRH seems to be acting in a similar fashion to some of\nthe components of the Sir protein complexes that repress\ngene expression at yeast telomeres and silent mating-type\nloci (36). Sir2-3-4 heterotrimers bind chromatin and naked\nDNA and bring about DNA condensation but the enzym-\natic activity of Sir2 is required for repression (37,38).\nSimilarly, once it is bound to DNA, PRH must recruit\nTLE co-repressor proteins that can in turn recruit\nhistone deacetylases in order to repress transcription\n(10). TLE proteins also oligomerize and condense chro-\nmatin and their oligomerization appears to be necessary\nfor repression (39\u201341). Although the binding of PRH and\nthe associated DNA condensation does not repress tran-\nscription, recruited TLE proteins might spread along the\nPRH\u2013DNA structures at PRH target genes resulting in\nrepression. Further experiments will be required to deter-\nmine whether like the Sir complex, PRH is itself able to\nbind nucleosomes or whether this protein replaces nucleo-\nsomes when it binds to PRH binding site arrays.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Ian Portman and the Electron Microscopy\nFacility, Department of Biological Sciences, University\nof Warwick (Wellcome Trust grant reference: 055663\/Z\/\n98\/Z) for instrument use and technical support.
