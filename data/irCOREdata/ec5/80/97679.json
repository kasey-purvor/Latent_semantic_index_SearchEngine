Unlike quasigeostrophic or rigid lid derivations, the\nonly approximation made (apart from linearization) is that changes in the circula-\ntion must be slow compared with the inertial frequency. Effects of stratification\nare included, but only parametrically in the sense that density is treated as a given\nquantity or forcing term rather than a variable.\n1\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, a number of large-scale barotropic modes have been identified in the ocean.\nParticularly visible at mid- to high-latitudes in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific, these\nmodes dominate the large-scale sea level variability at these latitudes for periods longer than a\nfew days and shorter than annual. Fukumori et al. (1998) give a good general overview of the\ndynamics of these modes, which have been examined in more detail by, among others, Hughes\net al. (1999), Ponte (1999), Webb and de Cuevas (2002a), Webb and de Cuevas (2002b), Fu\n(2003), and Weijer and Gille (2005). The modes discussed are typically basin scale, with single-\nsigned sea level signals occupying of order 90\u25e6 of longitude in the Southern Ocean. At these\nfrequencies and length scales, the theory of Gill and Niiler (1973) suggests that the influence\nof stratification can be ignored. This is consistent with the model diagnostics of Fukumori\net al. (1998), and is confirmed by the success of the barotropic models of Tierney et al. (2000),\nHirose et al. (2001), and Carre\u00b4re and Lyard (2003), among others, in explaining observed sea\nlevel signals.\nAt subinertial frequencies, theoretical understanding of these motions is aided by approxi-\nmations which filter out inertio-gravity waves, making it possible to construct a linear potential\nvorticity equation in one variable, which can be interpreted as describing a combination of to-\npographic Sverdrup balance and topographic Rossby waves. It is relatively easy to construct\nsuch an equation if the Coriolis parameter f can be taken to be constant (clearly not the case\nfor modes with the length scales discussed here), or if the rigid lid approximation can be made.\nUnfortunately, with such large scales, assuming a rigid lid is also a poor approximation. The\nterm in the potential vorticity equation which relates the the free surface is comparable to other\nterms if the wavelength of the mode considered is close to 2piR0, where R0 is the barotropic\n2\nRossby radius R0 =\n\u221a\ngH\/f , with g the acceleration due to gravity, and H the ocean depth.\nThis intuitive scaling will be rigorously justified later. Taking an ocean depth of 4000m gives\n\u221a\ngH = 200m s\u22121. Substituting a numerical value for the earth\u2019s rotation rate, and expressing\nR0 in degrees of longitude gives R0 = (24.7\/ sin(2\u03c6))\u25e6, where \u03c6 is latitude. Between latitudes\nof 30\u25e6 and 60\u25e6 (north or south), the term sin(2\u03c6) is between 0.866 and 1. This means that free\nsurface effects must be accounted for when the half-wavelength approaches piR0 \u2248 85\u25e6 of lon-\ngitude at mid-latitudes. This is precisely the length scale of the observed modes, meaning that\nfree surface effects are important.\nThe purpose of this note is to derive a linear barotropic potential vorticity equation which\nwill be valid for these large-scale subinertial modes. The modes occur in regions of strong\ntopography, so we cannot apply a quasigeostrophic approximation which is incapable of repre-\nsenting flows which cross a depth range which is a significant fraction of the total ocean depth.\nIn fact, apart from linearizing the momentum equations, the only approximation that must be\nmade is that the evolution of the flow be assumed slow compared to an inertial period. For com-\npleteness, we allow forcing by mass sources and atmospheric pressure, and include the effect of\nstratification in a parametric manner, although the main value of the equation we derive is for\nsituations in which the stratification can be considered constant. In order to link the final result\nwith some previously-used equations, however, we first consider the simpler rigid-lid case.\n3\n2. The rigid lid case\nIf we start with the linear momentum equation in terms of horizontal velocity u and density\n\u03c1:\n\u03c1ut + fk\u00d7 (\u03c1u) = G, (1)\nwhere k is a unit vector in the local vertical (upwards), and G is the horizontal force per unit\nvolume, then an integral from the sea floor (z = \u2212H) to the surface (z = \u03b7) gives the depth-\nintegrated equation\nUt + fk\u00d7U = F, (2)\nwhere U =\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u2212H \u03c1u dz is depth-integrated mass transport, and F = \u03c4 \u2212\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u2212H \u2207p dz. Here, \u03c4 is\nmeant to represent the surface wind stress, but can be taken to represent (wind-bottom) stress, or\nindeed any other depth-integrated force. Pressure is p, and \u2207 represents the horizontal gradient\noperator.\nFor the rigid lid case, we can set \u03b7 = 0. The pressure contribution to F then becomes\n\u222b\n0\n\u2212H\n\u2207p dz =\n\u222b\n0\n\u2212H\n\u2207(p\u2212 pb) dz + H\u2207pb, (3)\nwhere \u2207 is the horizontal gradient operator, and the difference between pressure p and bottom\npressure pb can be calculated using hydrostatic balance as p \u2212 pb = \u2212g\n\u222b z\n\u2212H \u03c1 dz\n\u2032. This means\nthat the first term on the right had side of (3) can be written as\n\u2212g\n\u222b\n0\n\u2212H\n\u2207\n\u222b z\n\u2212H\n\u03c1 dz\u2032 dz = \u2212g\u2207\n\u222b\n0\n\u2212H\n\u222b z\n\u2212H\n\u03c1 dz\u2032 dz = \u2207\n\u222b\n0\n\u2212H\n\u03c1gz dz = \u2207E. (4)\nThis allows us to write\nF = \u03c4 \u2212\u2207E \u2212H\u2207pb. (5)\n4\nIn addition, mass conservation in the rigid lid case (\u2207 \u00b7 U = 0) allows us to introduce a\nmass transport streamfunction \u03a8 defined by U = k\u00d7\u2207\u03a8, so that (2) becomes\nk\u00d7\u2207\u03a8t \u2212 f\u2207\u03a8 = \u03c4 \u2212\u2207E \u2212H\u2207pb. (6)\nIn the case of constant density, the pressure and density terms are more clearly combined as\n\u2207E + H\u2207pb = H\u2207p0, where p0 is pressure at the rigid lid (\u03b7 = 0).\nAs discussed by Hughes and Killworth (1995), it is possible to eliminate three different\nterms of this equation by taking the curl after dividing by 1, H , or f . The first option gives the\nbarotropic vorticity equation:\n\u22072\u03a8t + J(\u03a8, f) = \u2207\u00d7 \u03c4 + J(pb, H) (7)\n(since we are focusing on two-dimensional equations, the operator \u2207\u00d7 is taken as shorthand\nfor the scalar given by k \u00b7 \u2207\u00d7). Dividing by H first gives the barotropic potential vorticity\nequation:\n\u2207 \u00b7\n(\u2207\u03a8t\nH\n)\n+ J(\u03a8, f\/H) = \u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\nH\n)\n+ J(E, 1\/H). (8)\nDividing by f first gives a third equation:\n\u2207 \u00b7\n(\u2207\u03a8t\nf\n)\n= \u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\nf\n)\n+ J(E, 1\/f) + J(pb, H\/f). (9)\nUnlike the other two equations, no variable is eliminated by this manipulation (except in the\nsteady case).\nThere is no clear, exact way to incorporate the effect of a free surface into any of these\nequations. A free surface will introduce sea level or bottom pressure from the mass continuity\nequation, but the closest to a formulation in terms of bottom pressure is (9), which retains\nthe streamfunction in the tendency term. This is understandable, since the presence of a free\n5\nsurface permits a new class of waves: inertio-gravity waves. If we are to derive a free surface\nform of barotropic vorticity or potential vorticity equation, it must be in an approximation which\nremoves these waves. A different approach is needed.\n3. A free surface derivation\nStarting again with the depth-integrated linear momentum equation (2), we also need the\nmass continuity equation which can be written as\n\u2207 \u00b7U = Q\u2212Mt, (10)\nwhere Q is the mass source per unit area, and M is the ocean mass per unit area. This can\nbe rewritten using hydrostatic balance in terms of the difference between bottom pressure and\nsurface atmospheric pressure: M = (pb \u2212 pa)\/g. The aim is now to eliminate U from these\nequations, leaving equations in pressure only. We start by deriving two equations for \u2207\u00d7U by\ntaking the divergence of (2), and the curl of (2)\/f , and substituting for \u2207 \u00b7U from (14). This\ngives\nQt \u2212Mtt \u2212 f\u2207\u00d7U + U\u00d7\u2207f = \u2207 \u00b7 F, (11)\nand\n1\nf\n\u2207\u00d7Ut +\nUt \u00d7\u2207f\nf 2\n+ Q\u2212Mt = \u2207\u00d7\n(\nF\nf\n)\n. (12)\nWe can now eliminate \u2207\u00d7U by taking the time derivative of (11) plus f 2 times (12):\n(\u2202tt + f\n2)(Q\u2212Mt) + 2Ut \u00d7\u2207f = \u2207 \u00b7 Ft + f 2\u2207\u00d7\n(\nF\nf\n)\n. (13)\nIf f is uniform, the second term is zero and we have achieved our aim. When f varies,\nhowever, we need another equation for the zonal component of U. We get this by eliminating\n6\nthe meridional component from (2) by taking (2)t \u00d7\u2207f + f (2)\u00b7\u2207f , to obtain\n(\u2202tt + f\n2)U\u00d7\u2207f = Ft \u00d7\u2207f + fF \u00b7 \u2207f. (14)\nWe can now eliminate U from (13) and (14) by taking (\u2202tt + f 2)(13)\u22122(14)t. After some\ngathering of terms, this gives\n(\u2202tt + f\n2)2(Q\u2212Mt) = f 4\u2207\u00d7\n(\nF\nf\n)\n+ f 4\u2207 \u00b7\n(\nFt\nf 2\n)\n+\u2207\u00d7 (fFtt) +\u2207 \u00b7 Fttt. (15)\nThis is the exact equation, with U eliminated, which we were seeking. The only approxi-\nmation which has been made so far is linearization of the momentum equation. Together with\nF = \u03c4 \u2212 \u222b \u03b7\n\u2212H \u2207p dz and M = (pb \u2212 pa)\/g, it is an equation expressed purely in terms of pres-\nsures. However, being fifth order in time it is probably of little practical use in itself. Instead,\n(15) can be used to derive consistent approximations (LeBlond and Mysak (1978) derive an\nexactly equivalent equation, their Eq. 20.13a, expressed in terms of the inverse of the operator\n(\u2202tt + f\n2), and with no external forcing).\nA complete analysis of the relative orders of magnitude of each of the terms would depend\non the length scales, ocean depth, structure of the wind stress, and many other details. Our\nconcern here is to leave the equation as general as possible, making approximations only in\nterms of the frequency. Accordingly, we will make an expansion in the term \u03b4 = \u03c9\/f , where \u03b4\nis assumed to be much less than one. Dropping terms of order \u03b42 and smaller is then equivalent\nto dropping terms differentiated more than once with respect to time, and has the effect of\nfiltering out inertio-gravity waves. Doing this, and dividing by f 4, reduces (15) to\nQ\u2212Mt = \u2207\u00d7\n(\nF\nf\n)\n+\u2207 \u00b7\n(\nFt\nf 2\n)\n. (16)\nAgain, LeBlond and Mysak (1978) perform the same expansion, but they also make a substitu-\ntion in which a term of order \u03b4 is dropped. This results in the factor 1\/f 2 occurring outside the\n7\ndivergence term. Following their method through, but retaining the order \u03b4 term again results\nin an equation equivalent to (16) but with no external forcing.\nIn order to make the terms on the right hand side more explicit (to separate out rapid pressure\nchanges connected to the external mode, pressure changes due to stratification, and externally-\napplied stresses), we extend the results of Section 2 to write F = \u03c4 \u2212\u2207E\u2212H\u2207pb\u2212\n\u222b \u03b7\n0\n\u2207p dz.\nAs long as \u03b7 is much smaller than the depth over which horizontal pressure gradients are sub-\nstantial, the last term is much smaller than \u2207E + H\u2207pb and can be neglected. However, for\ncompleteness, we will give an almost exact form.\nAssuming only that z = 0 is always below the sea surface, but within a mixed layer such\nthat \u03c1 = \u03c1s(x, y) independent of depth above z = 0, a simple integral of the pressure gradient\nabove z = 0 leads to\nF = \u03c4 \u2212\u2207E \u2212H\u2207pb \u2212 g\u2207\n(\n\u03c1s\u03b7\n2\n2\n)\n\u2212 \u03b7\u2207pa, (17)\nwhich can also be written as\nF = \u03c4 \u2212\u2207E \u2212H\u2207pb +\ng\u03b72\n2\n\u2207\u03c1s \u2212 \u03b7\u2207p0, (18)\nwhere p0 is the pressure at z = 0 (sub-surface pressure). As in the rigid lid case, the vertical\nintegral of the pressure gradient simplifies in the homogeneous case (\u03c1 = constant), to give\nF = \u03c4 \u2212 h\u2207p0, (19)\nwhere h = H + \u03b7 is the total ocean depth.\nIgnoring the small free surface terms in (17) or (18), substitution into (16) gives\npbt\ng\n\u2212\u2207\u00b7\n(\nH\u2207pbt\nf 2\n)\n+J(pb, H\/f) = Q+\npat\ng\n\u2212\u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\nf\n)\n\u2212J(E, 1\/f)+\u2207\u00b7\n(\u2207Et \u2212 \u03c4 t\nf 2\n)\n. (20)\n8\nAlternatively, for the homogeneous case, if we note that pbt = p0t, then substitution of (19)\ninto (16) gives\np0t\ng\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7\n(\n(h\u2207p0)t\nf 2\n)\n+ J(p0, h\/f) = Q +\npat\ng\n\u2212\u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\nf\n)\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7\n(\n\u03c4 t\nf 2\n)\n, (21)\nwhere h = H + \u03b7 = H + (p0 \u2212 pa)\/\u03c1g is the total ocean depth, and p0 is again the pressure at\nsome reference level z = 0 not far below the surface. Substituting p0 = pa + \u03c1g\u03b7, (21) can also\nbe written in terms of sea level \u03b7 as\n\u03b7t \u2212\u2207 \u00b7\n(\ng(h\u2207\u03b7\u2032)t\nf 2\n)\n+ J(\u03b7\u2032, gh\/f) =\nQ\n\u03c1\n\u2212\u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\n\u03c1f\n)\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7\n(\n\u03c4 t\n\u03c1f 2\n)\n, (22)\nwhere \u03b7\u2032 = \u03b7 + pa\/(\u03c1g) represents the inverse-barometer corrected sea level.\nFor the large-scale, relatively high frequency modes we are considering, the role of stratifi-\ncation is small and (21) or (22) is the appropriate equation (for which a reasonable simplifying\napproximation is to replace h with H). The more general equation (20) is included to make it\nclear how this links to the rigid lid case and to other equations in the literature.\n4. Interpretation and comparison with other equations\nThe forcing terms on the right hand side of (21) can clearly be seen to be related to mass\nsources. There is the oceanic mass source Q, a measure of locally increasing atmospheric mass,\nand the divergence of the Ekman flux. The final term is an order \u03b4 correction to the Ekman flux\ndivergence to account for the finite time needed for the Ekman layer to come into equilibrium\nwith changing wind stress. We have already noted how this equation relates to that derived by\nLeBlond and Mysak (1978). It is interesting to compare (20) and (21) to the rigid-lid equations\nand to other equations which have been invoked in discussions of the large-scale modes of\ninterest here.\n9\nThe rigid-lid equation (9) is clearly the closest to (20). With hindsight it is simple to derive\na version of (9), correct to order \u03b4, in which the streamfunction is eliminated. The left hand side\nof (9) can be calculated by taking\u2212\u2207\u00b7((6)t\/f 2), in which the term derived from k\u00d7\u2207\u03a8t in (6)\ncan be dropped as it is of order \u03b42. Substituting into (9) then gives (20), except that the terms in\npbt and pat are missing (equivalent to taking the limit g \u2192\u221e), together with the oceanic mass\nsource Q, as appropriate for a rigid-lid limit.\nWe can now justify the scaling given in the introduction by looking at the order \u03b4 time-\ndependent terms in (21). It is clear that the size of the free surface term p0t\/g relative to the\nrigid-lid term \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (H\u2207p0t\/f 2) depends on the length scales over which p0 varies. Indeed,\nsubstituting p0 = a exp i(kx + ly \u2212 \u03c9t), and assuming spatial variations in p0 dominate over\nthose in H\/f 2, the ratio of the rigid-lid term to the free surface term is (k2 + l2)gH\/f 2 =\n(k2 + l2)R2\n0\n= (2piR0)\n2\/\u03bb2, where \u03bb is the wavelength considered. Thus, the free surface\nterm is as important as the rigid-lid term when \u03bb = 2piR0, and more important for longer\nwavelengths, as stated in the introduction.\nA number of alternative potential vorticity equations have already been invoked in theo-\nretical discussions of these large-scale modes. For example, Fu (2003) quotes the following\nequation (for a homogeneous fluid):\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n\u22072\u03b7 \u2212 f\n2\ngH\n\u03b7\n)\n+ HJ\n(\n\u03b7,\nf\nH\n)\n=\nf\n\u03c1g\n\u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\nH\n)\n. (23)\nA systematic derivation of this equation requires the quasigeostrophic approximation, which is\nnot capable of describing flows which cross a large range of depths. In fact, of the terms on the\nleft hand side, the only one which is wrong when large topography is included is\u22072\u03b7t, the other\n(planetary geostrophic) terms being correct even with finite changes of f and H . The equation\nis quoted as derived from Cummins (1991), but can be traced further back to Willebrand et al.\n10\n(1980), where it takes the form (including a nonlinear term)\n(\n\u22072 \u2212 f\n2\ngH\n)\n\u03a8t +\n1\n\u03c1H\nJ(\u03a8,\u22072\u03a8) + HJ(\u03a8, f\/H) = \u2207\u00d7 \u03c4 \u2212 fpat\ng\n, (24)\n(The factor 1\/\u03c1H corrects an error in Willebrand et al. (1980)). In addition to quasigeostrophy,\n(24) assumes in the nonlinear term that u is independent of depth. When the Ekman flux\nis limited to near-surface and near-bottom layers, or where stratification is important for the\nmean flow, this is no longer true, and the nonlinear term no longer takes a simple form. The\napparent differences between (23) and (24) result from the use of different variables, and from\nrather arbitrary choices as to whether factors of f and 1\/H occur inside or outside the spatial\nderivative in the stress and\u22072 terms: these are equivalent to quasigeostrophic accuracy. In (21),\nwe improve on these equations by allowing first order changes in f and H throughout, which\nresults in a clarification of where these factors should appear for best accuracy.\nA second equation recently quoted by Vivier et al. (2005) is\n\u2207 \u00b7\n(\u2207\u03a8t\nH\n)\n\u2212 \u03c1f\u03b7t\nH\n+ J(\u03a8, f\/H) = \u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\nH\n)\n, (25)\nwhich they use in a model formulation, with an additional geostrophic approximation to calcu-\nlate \u03b7 in terms of \u03a8 (a frictional term has here been absorbed into the stress term on the right\nhand side). Ignoring the free surface term in \u03b7, this is equivalent to a homogeneous ocean ver-\nsion of the rigid-lid equation (8). It therefore has better than quasigeostrophic accuracy when\nthe free surface term is negligible. However, the derivation of (25) in Appendix A of Vivier\net al. (2005) neglects a term of order \u03b4 which results from the depth-integrated flow across f\/H\ncontours due to the divergent part of the flow (this additional term is negligible in the quasi-\ngeostrophic limit), so that (25) is not uniformly accurate to order \u03b4, even before the geostrophic\nsubstitution is used for \u03b7. Our formulation in terms of pressure rather than streamfunction\nallows us to retain order \u03b4 accuracy, and to produce an equation in a single variable.\n11\nA third equation, given by Ponte (1999), is expressed in terms of bottom pressure pb as\npbt\ng\n+ J(pb, H\/f) + J(E, 1\/f) = \u2207\u00d7\n(\n\u03c4\nf\n)\n+ Q (26)\nplus \u201cother terms of order \u03c9\/f\u201d. Comparing with (20) (and ignoring forcing by atmospheric\npressure) we see that this is correct, apart from a sign error in the wind stress term, but it appears\nsomewhat arbitrary, given that one term (the first) of order \u03b4 = \u03c9\/f has been retained but others\ndiscarded. The missing terms are supplied in (20). The scaling argument given above shows\nthat the term retained in (26) can only be more important than the missing terms at wavelengths\ngreater than \u03bb = 2piR0. This is the planetary geostrophic limit, which can be considered as the\nopposite extreme to the rigid-lid case. It may be valuable in reduced gravity models, in which\nthe free surface is below an infinite layer of constant density water, and the corresponding\nRossby radius is much smaller. Otherwise it can only be applied to the largest possible scales\nof the ocean.\n5. Conclusions\nFor subinertial motions, (20) represents the most general form of a linear barotropic po-\ntential vorticity equation in a single scalar variable (actually, the small pressure gradient forces\nacting over a narrow surface layer have been neglected in (20), which can be generalized further\nby substituting (17) or (18) into (16)). In interpreting this as an equation in a single variable,\nhowever, we are implicitly assuming that the stratification (terms in E) does not respond signif-\nicantly to the flow on the timescales of the motion. For oscillating motions in which baroclinic\ncoupling is important, (20) is not very helpful.\nWhen the stratification can be considered constant, it is simpler to describe time-dependent\n12\nmotions using (21) or (22), which is the equivalent equation for a homegeneous ocean. When\nthe free surface height changes by a small fraction of the ocean depth, it is appropriate to re-\nplace the total ocean depth h in this equation with the depth H measured relative to a constant\nnear-surface level. This equation includes forcing due to wind stress, atmospheric pressure, and\nmass sources. It can represent motions on any length scale (subject to validity of the linear\nmomentum approximation and hydrostatic balance), on a planet with varying f and with topog-\nraphy occupying a significant fraction of the maximum depth. The main limitation, required\nto filter out inertio-gravity waves, is that the frequency of motions must be low compared to\nf . In practice, there is also a low frequency limit on validity, determined by the timescale on\nwhich the flow produces changes in stratification. This is dependent on amplitude, length scale\nand background stratification, but is in practice at least a few months for midlatitude motions at\nscales measured in thousands of kilometers. This order of accuracy is higher than that given by\nother equations currently available in the literature.\nAcknowledgments.\nThanks to John Huthnance and Andrew Willmott for useful feedback on a draft of this note,\nand to two anonymous referees for their input.
