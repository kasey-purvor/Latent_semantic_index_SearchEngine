Milan et al. (2001) identified a class of narrow,\nslow-moving HF radar backscatter echoes which originate\nbetween altitudes of 80 and 100 km, the ionospheric D- and\nlower E-regions. These echoes appeared to be associated\nwith the occurrence of pulsating aurora, which are known to\nbe created by energetic electrons capable of penetrating to D\nregion altitudes. In this study we show that these echoes are\nobserved in tandem with enhancements in cosmic noise ab-\nsorption (auroral absorption), additional evidence that ener-\ngetic (>30 keV) particle precipitation is responsible for gen-\nerating the irregularities from which a radar can scatter. In\naddition, we show that the D region backscatter echoes occur\npredominantly in the post-midnight sector during substorm\nrecovery phase, in common with auroral absorption events\nand pulsating aurora.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Ion chemistry\nand composition; Particle precipitation)\n1 Introduction\nThe SuperDARN radars (Greenwald et al., 1995; Chisham\net al., 2007) are designed to detect HF radiowave coherent\nbackscatter from ionospheric plasma irregularities at F re-\ngion altitudes which act as tracers of the polar ionospheric\nconvection pattern. However, these radars are also able to\ndetect backscatter from lower altitudes, mainly from irregu-\nlarities in the E region (e.g. Milan and Lester, 2001; Milan\net al., 2003). E region scatter can be considered as clutter\nin the radar observations as the irregularities drift at speeds\ndepressed below the F region convection speed. On the other\nhand, study of the characteristics of these echoes, observed\nby both HF and VHF radars, can reveal much about the com-\nplex collisional plasma physics which occurs at such alti-\nCorrespondence to: S. E. Milan\n(steve.milan@ion.le.ac.uk)\ntudes (e.g. Haldoupis, 1989; Milan and Lester, 2001; Mi-\nlan et al., 2004). The SuperDARN radars can discriminate\nbetween F region and lower-altitude backscatter by interfer-\nometric means (e.g. Milan et al., 1997a).\nAt even lower altitudes, there are at least two known\nmechanisms by which HF radar returns can be observed\nfrom the mesosphere or D region, but these are not neces-\nsarily coherent scatter processes. The ablation of meteors\nallows backscatter from the resulting plasma trails, and as\nthese trails are thought to drift with the neutral wind, me-\nteor echoes are useful for the investigation of mesospheric\ntides. Meteor echoes appear as \u201cgrainy near-range echoes\u201d\n(Hall et al., 1997) in SuperDARN observations, as meteor\ntrails are small in comparison to a radar range cell. Also,\nsome backscatter features have been associated with the oc-\ncurrence of Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes observed\nby MST radars (e.g. Ogawa et al., 2003), which are be-\nlieved to be caused by charged aerosols near the cold summer\nmesopause.\nThis paper investigates a proposed third mechanism for\nthe generation of D region echoes. First identified by Milan\net al. (2001), based upon 30 min of observations, spatially-\nextensive regions of D region echoes appeared to be asso-\nciated with pulsating aurora. In addition to their altitude of\norigin, the echoes observed were unusual in that their spectra\nwere exceptionally narrow, having spectral widths less than\n20 m s\u22121, which is in contrast to the bulk of E region spec-\ntra which have widths in excess of 100 m s\u22121. Indeed, such\nspectral widths are comparable to those of meteor echoes, in\nwhich the decorrelation of the radar auto correlation function\nis governed by the rate of ambipolar diffusion of the plasma\ntrail rather than ionospheric instability growth and decay\ntimes (Hall et al., 1997; Milan et al., 2001). The energy spec-\ntrum of precipitating electrons associated with pulsating au-\nrora is expected to be relatively hard (Stenbaek-Nielsen and\nHallinan, 1979), the bulk of the energy flux being carried by\nelectrons between 5 and 40 keV (Sandahl et al., 1980) which\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1898 S.

(2001) speculated that spatially-structured\nprecipitation \u2013 and the resulting spatially-structured electron\ndensity enhancement \u2013 could allow backscatter from these\nlow altitudes, and that the decay of the irregularities would\nbe governed by the ambipolar diffusion rate.\nIn this paper we investigate this mechanism further by us-\ning riometer observations of cosmic radio noise absorption\n(CNA) to diagnose enhancements of the D region electron\ndensity. We show that the pulsating aurora from the origi-\nnal study of Milan et al. (2001) are indeed associated with\nenhanced CNA, consistent with energetic particle precipita-\ntion. We further show that during an additional 18 h of riome-\nter observations, from 3 separate nights, other occurrences of\ncosmic noise absorption are associated with detection of this\nlow-altitude echo population.\n2 Observations\nWe begin by re-examining the interval first studied by Mi-\nlan et al. (2001), that is 23:30 to 24:00 UT, 13 September\n1999. We employ observations from the SuperDARN radar\nlocated at \u00deykkvib\u00e6r in Iceland, built and operated by the\nUniversity of Leicester (see e.g. Milan et al., 1997b), when\nit was operating in \u201cmyopic\u201d mode, that is with 15 km range\ngates rather than the usual 45 km, to focus specifically on the\nnear-range field-of-view where E region backscatter is typi-\ncally seen (e.g. Milan and Lester, 2001). Sixteen beams are\nsounded at a radar operating frequency of 10 MHz, and the\nbackscatter returns gated into 75 range cells, with a range to\nthe first gate of 180 km, and a maximum range of 1305 km.\nUnder the near-range field-of-view of the radar is the Ice-\nlandic village of Tj\u00f6rnes which acts as one of the observing\nlocations for occasional all-sky camera (ASC) campaigns run\nby the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR), Japan.\nTj\u00f6rnes is also the location of a 30 MHz imaging riometer,\nrun on a continuous basis by NIPR.\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 1897\u20131904, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1897\/2008\/\nS. E. Milan et al.: D region HF radar echoes 1899\nThe left-hand column of Fig. 1 shows a sequence of three\nimages taken by the Tj\u00f6rnes white-light ASC. The images\nare aligned with magnetic north to the top and magnetic east\nto the left. The brightness scale is in uncalibrated, arbitrary\nunits. The central N-S meridian of the images, along which\nwe will compare measurements from different instruments,\nis indicated by a vertical dashed line. The main feature to\nnote in all three images is the presence of a discrete auro-\nral arc to the south of the ASC zenith. Superimposed on\nthe images is the location of the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radar field-of-\nview projected to an altitude of 100 km, including the edges\nof the field-of-view, the boresite, and the location of every\n15th range gate. The second column shows CNA measure-\nments from the Tj\u00f6rnes riometer (projection independent of\naltitude). The third and fourth columns show the correspond-\ning radar data, the backscatter spectral width and the altitude\nof backscatter determined by interferometric techniques, re-\nspectively.\nIn the first image of the sequence, 23:46 UT, dim auroral\nemission is observed to the west of the radar field-of-view\n(to the right), north of the discrete arc. Although not appar-\nent from the captured images, this region of auroral emis-\nsion comprises irregular patches of pulsating aurora. At this\ntime the radar backscatter originates from typical E region\naltitudes, 100 to 120 km, and the backscatter echoes have\nspectral widths of the order of 100 to 500 m s\u22121, typical of\nE region backscatter (e.g. Milan and Lester, 2001). In the\nsecond and third images, 23:54 and 23:58 UT, the region of\npulsating aurora expands eastwards (towards the left) across\nthe radar field-of-view. Simultaneously, the radar echoes de-\ncrease in spectral width to less than 20 m s\u22121, and the altitude\nof backscatter decreases to between 80 and 100 km. These\nwere the findings presented by Milan et al. (2001). In addi-\ntion we show the corresponding riometer measurements. If\nthe pulsating aurora do indeed deposit ionization at low al-\ntitudes, such that backscatter echoes are observed from the\nlower-E and D regions (henceforth, for brevity we refer to\nthese just as D region echoes), then we expect an increase in\nriometer absorption. This is just what is observed, absorp-\ntion increasing from 0 to 0.6 dB across the riometer field-of-\nview, especially in the southern portion. This lends credence\nto our interpretation that the occurrence of the low-altitude\nbackscatter is caused by the deposition of energetic particles\nin D region and the associated secondary ionization.\nThese observations are reiterated in Fig. 2, which shows\nthe time-evolution of the auroral, riometer, and backscatter\nobservations between 23:30 and 24:00 UT. Panel (a) shows\na keogram of the auroral observations from the north-south\nmeridian of the field-of-view of the ASC. At the start of the\ninterval an auroral arc is seen to the north, though this fades at\n23:42 UT. The auroral arc to the south of Tj\u00f6rnes identified in\nFig. 1 is apparent throughout the interval, though this bright-\nens at 23:43 UT, corresponding to the onset of a substorm\nidentified in concurrent magnetometer traces. Pulsating au-\nrora appear to the north of this arc after 23:55 UT, extending\nFig. 2.

Panel (b) shows\nthe CNA measurements of the riometer taken along the\nkeogram meridian. The absorption increases from 23:48 UT,\nthough most markedly after 23:55 UT, associated with the\nappearance of the pulsating aurora. The absorption is great-\nest in the southern portion of the field-of-view, coincident\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1897\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 1897\u20131904, 2008\n1900 S. E.

Variations in the observed auroral brightness at five points\nwithin the all-sky camera field-of-view, allowing the temporal vari-\nations associated with the pulsating aurora to be determined. The\ncurves have been offset for clarity.\nwith the pulsating aurora, though absorption is also present\npolewards of this. Panel (c) shows the radar spectral width\nmeasurements, again projected along the keogram meridian.\nThere is a clear and sudden decrease in the spectral widths\nat 23:54 UT, coincident with the appearance of the pulsating\naurora and the increase in CNA. Panel (d) shows the asso-\nciated altitude of the backscatter volume, showing the sud-\nden decrease in backscatter altitude at 23:54 UT. Panel (e)\nshows the distribution of spectral widths within the backscat-\nter within the near-range field-of-view of the radar, that is in\nall beams and for range gates 0 to 29. The overall occurrence\nof backscatter echoes increases after 23:42 UT, apparently\nassociated with the increase in brightness of the southern\narc at this time. Before 23:54 UT the distribution of widths\nis broad, encompassing values between 100 and 400 m s\u22121.\nThis drops after 23:54 UT to widths below 150 m s\u22121, with\nmost echoes having widths less than 20 m s\u22121. Finally,\npanel (f) shows the number of echoes observed at differ-\ning altitudes. Prior to 23:54 UT these occur predominantly\nnear 120 km. Subsequently, the altitude of backscatter drops\nabruptly to between 80 and 100 km. Hence, Fig. 2 shows a\nclear association between the appearance of pulsating aurora,\nthe occurrence of CNA, and the appearance of a low-altitude,\nnarrow-spectra backscatter population. At the same time, the\npre-existing E region echo population disappears.\nFig. 4. Three examples of the correspondence between riometer\nabsorption and the occurrence of D region radar echoes.

Milan et al.: D region HF radar echoes 1901\nFigure 3 presents time series of the brightness at 5 selected\npoints within the ASC field-of-view for the period associated\nwith pulsating aurora, 23:54 to 24:00 UT; the curves have\nbeen offset for clarity. Each curve shows transient quasi-\nperiodic enhancements in the brightness, with periods rang-\ning from a few seconds to a few tens of seconds. This in-\ndicates that the variations in brightness at different points\nwithin the aurora occur independently of each other, demon-\nstrating the patchy nature of the pulsations described above.\nTo determine the reproducibility of these observations, we\nexamined other runs of the myopic mode on the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r\nradar which occurred on 12 nights in September 1999 and\nSeptember 2000. E region backscatter is usually observed\nby the radar between 18:00 and 06:00 UT (MLT\u2248UT+0.5)\nas at these times the auroral electrojets are located in the\nnear-range field-of-view. Hence, myopic runs are usually\nscheduled between these times. Figure 4 presents three ex-\namples of radar and riometer observations from 00:00 to\n06:00 UT on 11 and 13 September 1999 and 30 September\n2000. In each case, the middle panel shows the total num-\nber of backscatter echoes observed in the first 30 gates of\nthe field-of-view of the radar (solid curve) where E region\nbackscatter typically occurs (maximum possible is 30 gates\n\u00d7 16 beams = 480 cells). Superimposed on this is the oc-\ncurrence of backscatter echoes which originate below an al-\ntitude of 100 km and which have a spectral width less than\n20 m s\u22121 (filled bars), the characteristics of the new backscat-\nter population expected from the previous discussion. The\nnumber of such echoes has been multiplied by 5 for clar-\nity. In each case, the bottom panel shows the CNA measure-\nments from the Tj\u00f6rnes riometer operating in a wide-beam,\nvertically-sounding mode. The top panel shows the H com-\nponent magnetogram from the SAMNET magnetometer sta-\ntion colocated with the Iceland radar site, HLL, with trian-\ngles showing the times of significant Pi2 activity indicating\nthe onset of substorm activity.\nIn each example we find between 2 and 4 main episodes\nof low altitude backscatter. Most of these occur in tandem\nwith absorption of the cosmic noise background observed\nby the riometer; coincident events are marked by horizon-\ntal bars for clarity. On occasions these are also associated\nwith overall decreases in the number of E region echoes ob-\nserved, as might be expected if the radar signals are also be-\ning attenuated in the enhanced D region. These results graph-\nically demonstrate the association between enhancements of\nthe D region electron density, giving rise to auroral absorp-\ntion of the cosmic noise background, and the observation of\nbackscatter echoes from D region altitudes. In each case, the\nmagnetogram indicates a substorm bay (a negative excursion\nassociated with the substorm westward electrojet) and Pi2\nactivity commencing a few 10s of minutes prior to the event,\nsuggesting that the CNA and D region backscatter are sub-\nstorm recovery phase phenomena.\nIt is interesting to note that although runs of the myopic\nmode usually took place from 18:00 to 06:00 UT, most sig-\nFig. 5.

The\nproportion of echoes from the D region is indicated in the lower\npanel.\nnificant occurrences of the new backscatter population oc-\ncurred in the post-midnight sector, as reflected in our choice\nof examples in Fig. 4. To investigate this in more detail,\nFig. 5 indicates the UT occurrence of E region echoes (solid\ncurve) and D region echoes (grey bars). This was constructed\nfrom the 12 runs of the myopic mode in September 1999 and\n2000, comprising 124 h of observations and 1.6\u00d7106 echoes.\nThis is measured as the cell occupancy, the proportion of\ncells in the near-range field-of-view between gates 10 and\n30 that are filled with echoes originating below 150 km in al-\ntitude (E region) and below 100 km (D region). We set the\nfirst range as gate 10 so as not to include the occurrence of\nmeteor echoes which occur only in the very nearest ranges.\nThe bottom panel then shows the proportion of echoes which\nare from the D region. The overall echo occurrence is ap-\nproximately 50%, though higher post-midnight (60%) than\npre-midnight (40%) indicating that more backscatter is ob-\nserved from the westward electrojet than the eastward elec-\ntrojet. The occurrence of D region echoes increases dra-\nmatically in the morning sector, from 1% of echoes before\n02:00 MLT, up to nearly 4% of echoes by 06:00 MLT.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1897\/2008\/ Ann.

A comparison of the Doppler shift distribution of E region\n(solid curve) and D region (grey bars) echoes.\nFinally, we investigate the Doppler shift of the echoes in\nFig. 6. The occurrence distributions of Doppler shifts in\nbins 25 m s\u22121 wide are shown for all echoes originating be-\nlow 150 km (solid curve) and from below 100 km with un-\nusually narrow spectra (grey bars). The E region distribu-\ntion peaks at 0 m s\u22121, though is broad with wings extending\nto \u00b1750 m s\u22121, and distinct shoulders at \u00b1400 m s\u22121 corre-\nsponding to the ion-acoustic speed and the occurrence of the\ntwo-stream instability (Milan and Lester, 2001). There are\nmore echoes at negative Doppler velocities as these originate\nin the westward electrojet (the radar looks east and Doppler\nshifts away from the radar are negative) which has a higher\nscattering occurrence (Fig. 5). The D region distribution also\npeaks near 0 m s\u22121, but now is much narrower, with 75%\nof echoes having Doppler shifts within \u00b1100 m s\u22121 (as op-\nposed to 40% in the E region distribution). There are still\nshoulders in the distribution near the ion-acoustic speed, but\nthese appear to be due to echoes from the E region with er-\nroneous altitude estimates. It is possible that the D region\nDoppler shift distribution is shifted towards negative values\nby approximately 25 m s\u22121.\n3 Discussion\nWe have presented examples of an HF radar backscatter pop-\nulation that occurs at altitudes between 80 and 100 km, with\nechoes which have unusually low spectral widths (less than\n20 m s\u22121). Such echoes occur predominantly in the post-\nmidnight sector, in association with enhancements of the D\nregion electron density. Such enhancements lead to the at-\ntenuation of HF radio signals, often referred to as auroral\nabsorption, which we measure as cosmic noise absorption\n(CNA). It has also been suggested that this occurs in asso-\nciation with pulsating aurora, which are known to have a\nhard precipitating energy spectrum (Stenbaek-Nielsen and\nHallinan, 1979; Sandahl et al., 1980), and so are expected\nto produce enhancement of the D region electron density.\nOne of our events is certainly associated with pulsating au-\nrora. The backscatter events were observed predominantly\nbetween 02:00 to 06:00 MLT, though as the latter marked the\nend of each observing interval it is possible that the occur-\nrence could continue later into the morning sector.\nThe local time occurrence of the echoes matches the\nknown local time occurrence of both pulsating aurora and\nauroral absorption. Pulsating aurora are generally a morn-\ning sector, substorm recovery phase phenomenon. Auroral\nabsorption maximizes in the morning sector following sub-\nstorm onset as energetic electrons injected into the midnight\nsector drift eastwards under the influence of gradient and cur-\nvature drift (e.g. Milan et al., 1996). However, it remains\nto be determined if all occurrences of D region backscatter\nare associated with pulsating aurora, or just more generally\nwith any precipitation event that gives rise to a D region en-\nhancement. We will address this in future by performing an\ndetailed comparison of such backscatter with optical obser-\nvations of pulsating aurora.\nIt is interesting to note in Fig. 2 that after the new low-\naltitude echoes appear, the pre-existing population of E re-\ngion echoes is no longer observed. It is not clear if this is\nbecause (a) the irregularities in the E region are no longer\npresent, (b) the E region echoes are masked by the backscat-\nter from lower altitudes, or (c) the radar signals from the E\nregion are absorbed during their traversal of the D region, in\nthe same way that the riometer measures CNA. The second\nreason (b) seems not to be the case as the transition occurs in\nassociation with an overall decrease in the backscatter power\nof the echoes observed (not shown). In other words, the D re-\ngion echoes do not dominate over the E region ones. We can\nestimate the expected attenuation of the backscatter power of\nthe E region echoes from the observed CNA, which peaks\nat \u223c0.6 dB. D region nondeviative attenuation of HF radio\nwaves of frequency f varies as (e.g. Davies, 1990):\nL (dB)=8.68\ne2\n2\u03b50mc\nN0\u03bd01h\nf 2\n\u2248 N0\u03bd01h\n106f 2\nwhere the D region is treated as a slab of thickness 1h\nwith mean electron number density and collision frequency\nN0 and \u03bd0, respectively; the other symbols have their usual\nmeanings. The observed 0.6 dB of attenuation at f =30 MHz\nallows an estimate of the electron density of the D region\nto be made: assuming 1h=20 km and \u03bd0=106 s\u22121, N0\u22482\u2013\n3\u00d71010 m\u22123. In addition, the f\u22122 dependence of the absorp-\ntion indicates that 0.6 dB of absorption at the riometer oper-\nating frequency corresponds to 5 dB at the radar frequency\nof 10 MHz. We must consider that the radar signals traverse\nthe D region twice as they propagate to the E region and\nback, whereas the riometer measures \u201cone-way\u201d absorption\nof the cosmic noise. In addition, the radar signals propagate\nobliquely through the D region, whereas the riometer beams\npoint more vertically. We might then expect up to 30 dB of\nAnn.

Milan et al.: D region HF radar echoes 1903\nattenuation of E region backscatter returns, which is close to\ntheir backscatter power prior to the arrival of the pulsating\naurora. Hence, it is possible that the disappearance of the E\nregion echoes is caused by auroral absorption.\nThe exact mechanism for the generation of the plasma\ndensity irregularities from which the radar scatters is uncer-\ntain. We now briefly discuss two possible scenarios, in which\nan ionospheric instability mechanism structures the plasma,\nand in which the radar returns are due to partial reflection\nfrom density variations imposed by structure in the precipi-\ntation itself.\nThe observations suggest that the backscatter appears over\na broad range of magnetic aspect angles, in other words that\na non-aspect sensitive scattering mechanism is at work. The\nD region electron density is sufficiently low (even when en-\nhanced) that refraction of the radar signals will be negligible\nand straight-line propagation can be assumed. For instance,\nthe refractive index of the D region is given by (e.g. Davies,\n1990):\n\u00b52 = 1\u2212 f\n2\np\nf 2\nwhere fp is the plasma frequency in a plasma of electron\ndensity N0 (estimated above) given by\nfp =\n\u221a\nN0e2\n4pi2\u03b50m\n.\nAt the radar operating frequency of 10 MHz, \u00b5\u22480.99. Ap-\nplication of Snell\u2019s Law indicates that for a radar ray incident\non the D region at an angle of 60\u25e6 to the vertical, the ray is\nrefracted by approximately 1\u25e6 towards the horizontal, that is,\nby a negligible amount. Hence we can estimate the aspect\nangle of the radar beams at the points at which scatter is ob-\nserved. The echoes appear over an extended region of the\nfield-of-view, between ranges of 200 and 500 km. Assum-\ning that the scatter originates at 90 km altitude, this implies\nthat echoes are observed from locations at which the radar\nsignals are propagating at angles between 10\u25e6 and 25\u25e6 to the\nhorizontal, implying aspect angles as high as 25\u25e6. R\u00fcster\nand Schlegel (1999) demonstrated the observation of low al-\ntitude scatter by a 50 MHz radar at aspect angles as high\nas 90\u25e6. Robinson and Schlegel (2000) proposed an insta-\nbility mechanism for creating low altitude, non aspect sen-\nsitive irregularities, to account for these observations. That\nmechanism relied on electron precipitation to destabilize the\nlower ionosphere, which is consistent with our observed as-\nsociation with pulsating aurora and cosmic noise absorption.\nWe should note that high aspect angle backscatter has pre-\nviously been observed at HF, but at altitudes above 120 km\nand is thought to be associated with an ionospheric instabil-\nity mechanism (Milan et al., 2004; Drexler and St.-Maurice,\n2005).\nOn the other hand, the D region echoes observed are ex-\nceptionally narrow, with spectral widths akin to those of me-\nteor scatter. This could suggest that the decorrelation of the\nradar signals is governed by ambipolar diffusion of blobs\nof plasma deposited by precipitation rather than irregularity\ngrowth and decay rates dictated by an ionospheric instability\nmechanism (Milan et al., 2001). Hall et al. (1997) proposed\nthat the spectral width of echoes scattering from diffusing\nmeteor trails should be 1v=8piD\/\u03bb, where D is the am-\nbipolar diffusion coefficient and \u03bb is the radar wavelength,\nwhich is 30 m in the present case. If we propose a similar\nscattering mechanism then our observed spectral widths of\n20 m s\u22121 and less are associated with values of D less than\napproximately 20 m2 s\u22121. This occurs at altitudes of 100 km\nand below (Hall et al., 1997), consistent with our altitude es-\ntimates from the interferometer. It is possible, then, that the\nbackscatter occurs from spatial inhomogeneities in the pre-\ncipitation giving rise to irregularities in the D region. If the\nbackscatter process is coherent, then these irregularities are\nof a spatial scale similar to the wavelength of the radar sig-\nnals, that is of the order of 10 m. Alternatively, if the density\ngradients are sufficiently high, a partial reflection mechanism\ncould be at work. This mechanism is also consistent with the\nnon aspect sensitivity of the observed scatter.\n4 Conclusions\nDuring the recovery phase of substorms, in concert with\npulsating aurora and enhancement of the D region by ener-\ngetic precipitation, the latter resulting in cosmic radio noise\nabsorption, the SuperDARN radars can observe backscatter\nechoes from heights between 80 and 100 km, significantly\nbelow the altitude at which E region scatter is seen. The\nechoes are exceptionally narrow, and have Doppler shifts in\ngeneral below 100 m s\u22121. The scatter appears to arise in re-\ngions where the aspect angle is as high as 25\u25e6, as the D region\nelectron density is insufficient to refract the radar signals to\northogonality with the magnetic field.\nIt is not clear if the irregularities from which the radars\nscatter are created by structured precipitation or are due to an\nionospheric instability process. However, the narrow spectra\nperhaps favour a mechanism in which blobs of plasma are\ndeposited at low altitudes by precipitation, in a manner akin\nto the ablation of meteors observed as meteor scatter.\nThese D region echoes are a relatively common feature of\nSuperDARN measurements during substorm recovery phase.\nThe echo characteristics, especially their low Doppler shift,\nare such that they could contaminate studies of the iono-\nspheric flow excited by substorms. Clearly, it is important\nthat these echoes are properly identified during such studies\nas not arising from the F region. On the other hand, they\nprovide an indication of the occurrence of energetic particle\nprecipitation, and as such can help diagnose the precipitation\ncharacteristics during substorm and non-substorm times.\nAcknowledgements.
