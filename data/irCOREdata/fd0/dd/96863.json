INTRODUCTION\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking under nonequilibrium\nconditions is characteristic of a wide variety of physical and\nchemical systems; it is found in areas as diverse as fluid\nflow, nonlinear optics, and oscillations and waves in chemi-\ncal reactions @1#. On the other hand, conclusive evidence for\nsuch processes to underly spatial patterning in biological sys-\ntems is relatively rare ~cf. @2#!. The amoeboid microorganism\nDictyostelium discoideum has long been considered a para-\ndigm for the study of biological pattern formation, and re-\ncently a mechanism of self-organized patterning akin to\nthose in inanimate systems has been implicated in a morpho-\nlogical transition in its life cycle. When switching from uni-\ncellular to a multicellular mode of existence, cell aggregates\nemerge from an initially uniform layer of single cells, form-\ning a pattern of dense cell streams which coalesce into ag-\ngregation centers @Fig. 1~a!#. A range of mathematical mod-\nels based on experimentally established single-cell properties\nhas been employed to investigate the mechanism of cell\nstreaming @3\u20138#. Numerical simulations of these models\ndemonstrate that aggregation via cell streaming is the result\nof an interaction of reaction-diffusion waves of an intercel-\nlular signaling molecule, cyclic adenosine\n3858-monophosphate ~cAMP!, with chemically directed cell\nmovement ~chemotaxis!.\nIn the simulations, it appears that this interaction causes\nan instability of wave propagation through the uniform cell\nlayer that underlies the formation of the stream pattern.\nVasiev et al. @4# suggest that the dependence of the cAMP\nwave speed on cell density plays a crucial role in the insta-\nbility mechanism. This assertion is substantiated by recent\nresults of Van Oss et al. @7# that show failure of cell stream-\ning in the absence of such a dependence in the model and\nprovide experimental evidence of its existence in the in vivo\nsystem. However, the model results are not conclusive, as\nthey are obtained from numerical simulations only, and the\npotential influence of various factors is difficult to discern.\nIn order to expose the instability mechanism, linear sta-561063-651X\/97\/56~2!\/2074~7!\/$10.00bility analysis of traveling wave solutions to aggregation\nmodels has been attempted in @5,9#; owing to the structure of\nthe underlying models, both are essentially numerical. Apart\nfrom the common conclusion that there is a \u2018\u2018cell streaming\ninstability\u2019\u2019 transverse to the direction of wave propagation,\nthe predictions of the two analyses are quite different. Levine\nand Reynolds @9# find a rather complicated spectrum of\ngrowth rates of the unstable modes, v(k2), with a maximum\nfor the homogeneous mode k50 and a region of complex\ngrowth rates for large enough wave numbers k , predicting\nmodes oscillatory in time as well as in space. In contrast,\nHo\u00a8fer et al. @5# obtain a real dispersion relation v(k2) with a\nsingle maximum at nonzero k . Despite a number of approxi-\nmations made, the predicted dominant wave number com-\npares quantitatively with the dominant wave number of the\nemerging stream pattern in model simulations. However, the\nfindings in @4,7# appear not to be captured by the analysis in\n@5#, as no provision is made for the cell density dependence\nof the cAMP wave speed.\nThe purpose of the present paper is twofold. First, we\ntranslate the suggestion by Vasiev et al. @4# and Van Oss\net al. @7# into a comparatively simple model of the cAMP\nwave cell interaction. The model is developed as an approxi-\nmation to existing models of aggregation, with the advantage\nof allowing both traveling wave solutions and their stability\nto be established analytically. Second, we use the explicit\nresults on the parameter dependence of the streaming insta-\nbility obtained to reexamine the previous interpretations of\nthe instability mechanism suggested by simulation studies\nand ~numerical! linear stability analyses.\nFollowing a brief review of the cell biology and the ex-\nisting models of Dictyostelium aggregation in Sec. II, in Sec.\nIII we derive the model of the cAMP wave cell interaction.\nThe derivation exploits a geometrical representation of the\ncAMP waves as cAMP concentration contours, which is\ncoupled with the dynamics of chemotaxis. The explicit linear\nstability analysis of its traveling wave solutions is carried out\nin Sec. IV. In Sec. V, these results are contrasted with the\nnumerical results obtained on aggregation in the different\nmodels and the framework and results of the previous stabil-2074 \u00a9 1997 The American Physical Society\n56 2075STREAMING INSTABILITY OF SLIME MOLD AMOEBAE: AN . . .FIG. 1.

BIOLOGY AND MODELS OF AGGREGATION\nDictyostelium discoideum belongs to a group of microor-\nganisms that show aggregation of single cells to form cellu-\nlar aggregates at some phase in their life cycles @10#. InDictyostelium, multicellular development is induced by lack\nof nutrients and leads, via the aggregation of up to 105 cells,\nto the formation of a motile sluglike organism, eventually\ntransforming into a fruiting body.\nThe process of aggregation has been described in detail\n~cf. @11# and references therein!. Following starvation, amoe-\nbae acquire the ability to respond to extracellular stimulation\nby cAMP with intracellular synthesis and secretion of cAMP\n2076 56THOMAS HO\u00a8 FER AND PHILIP K. MAINI~\u2018\u2018autocatalysis\u2019\u2019! and also with chemotactic movement to-\nwards increasing cAMP concentration. Concomitantly,\ncAMP-degrading enzymes are expressed and secreted. At the\nonset of aggregation, concentric and spiral waves of cAMP\nare observed in the layer of amoebae. In the cAMP gradients\nof the wave fronts, cell movement towards the centers of the\nwave patterns takes place, alternating with a stationary phase\nin the wave backs and in between waves @12,13#. Typical\ncAMP wave speeds c are significantly larger than the maxi-\nmum cell speed w0 ~c'200\u2013600 mm\/min, w0'20\u201330 mm\/\nmin!, and consequently, the initially uniform cell density\naway from the aggregation centers remains practically undis-\nturbed by chemotaxis @14#. However, cell movement subse-\nquently ceases to be \u2018\u2018slaved\u2019\u2019 by the cAMP waves. Rather\nthan simply collecting at the aggregation centers, amoebae\norganize in a pattern of branching cell streams, in which they\nestablish cell-cell contacts\u2014a crucial process for postaggre-\ngative development @15#. This breakup of the cell layer be-\ncomes visible after the passage of about 10\u201320 cAMP wave\nfronts, with a typical wave period of 5\u20138 min @Fig. 1~a!#.\nA minimal mechanistic model of the aggregation process\nincludes ~i! the local kinetics and diffusion of the external\nsignal, extracellular cAMP, ~ii! the motile cell response to-\nwards cAMP, and ~iii! the cell-internal dynamics of sensing\ncAMP, involving fast processes of signal relay to cAMP syn-\nthesis and motile machinery that can be eliminated adiabati-\ncally, and slow processes changing the sensitivity of an\namoeba towards the cAMP signal ~desensitization!.

Here\nagain the response depends on the cellular sensitivity with\nx(v) being an increasing function of v @21,22#. The studies\nof Vasiev et al. @4# and Ho\u00a8fer et al. @5,6# employ models of\nthe types ~1!\u2013~3!, the first one with standard Fitzhugh-\nNagumo excitable dynamics and the latter two with a sim-\nplified version of the cAMP kinetics derived from a detailed\nmodel of cAMP signaling @23#.\nAn alternative approach consists in replacing Eq. ~3! by\nthe dynamics of discrete, particle like, cells equipped with\ninternal cAMP dynamics and a chemotactic movement rule\n@3,7,8#. In some of this work, the dynamics of cAMP signal\ntransduction have been modeled in more detail than Eqs. ~1!\nand ~2!, by introducing evolution equations for a greater\nnumber of intracellular variables.\nThese aggregation models were preceded by models fo-\ncusing exclusively on the cAMP wave phenomena @23\u201326#.\nNeglecting the cell density dynamics, the cAMP dynamics\nwere considered on an idealized stationary cell layer ~a rea-\nsonable approximation for the very beginning of aggrega-\ntion!, and therefore these investigations serve as a reference\npoint for the analysis of Eqs. ~1!\u2013~3!. Specifically, it was\nshown that a systematic reduction of a detailed biochemical\nmodel yields the two-variable system ~1! and ~2! ~with n\n5n0 , a constant! @23#. The kinetics f (u ,v) and g(u ,v) aris-\ning in this reduced model are of standard excitable type ~Fig.\n2. Below we will exploit this general property of Eqs. ~1! and\n~2! without resorting to detailed algebraic expression for\nf (u ,v) and g(u ,v).\nIn numerical simulations based on those biochemical rate\nlaws and parameter estimates from experimental data, one\nfinds concentric waves emanating from a periodic pacemaker\nand spiral wave solutions that closely match the cAMP\nwaves observed at the beginning of aggregation in experi-\nments @24#. These wave patterns appear to be stable\nasymptotic states of the dynamics, as is observed in a host of\nother excitable media of physical or chemical origin @27#.\nHowever, the recent simulations of the aggregation model\n~1!\u2013~3! and related models exhibit a slow transient, relative\nto the time scale of wave propagation, in the course of which\nthe cell distribution undergoes a breakup transverse to the\ncAMP wave fronts, accompanied by distortion and breakup\nof the cAMP waves. A representative example is depicted in\nFig. 1~b!. It clearly shows how the breakup leads to the for-\nmation of the cell stream pattern seen in vivo. Thus the nu-\nmerical results strongly suggest that the combined dynamics\nof cAMP waves and cell movement give rise to an instability\n56 2077STREAMING INSTABILITY OF SLIME MOLD AMOEBAE: AN . . .which causes the growth of small initial perturbations of the\nuniform cell distribution @in the case of Fig. 1~b!# or the\nother variables.\nLinear stability analysis of periodic wave solutions of\nEqs. ~1!\u2013~3! should expose such an instability. Before pro-\nceeding to construct a specific model incorporating the wave\nspeed hypothesis of @4,7#, we outline the principle of such an\nanalysis ~e.g., @28#!. For simplicity, we focus on the stability\nof planar periodic waves of the aggregation model @far from\nthe center of the wave pattern, both concentric waves origi-\nnating from a periodic pacemaker and spiral waves will ap-\npear as ~locally! planar periodic waves#. Consider a system\nof evolution equations ]u\/]t5F(\u00b92u,\u0093u,u) on an infinite\ntwo-dimensional domain (x ,y)P(2` ,`)3(2` ,`). Let\nU(z) denote a planar periodic traveling wave solution with\nperiod L and wave speed c; z5x2ct denotes the appropri-\nate traveling coordinate frame. Consider a small perturbation\nabout U, of the form a(z)exp$vt1iky%. Then the evolution of\na will be governed by the linear system, arising from the\nlinearization of F about U, da\/dz5A\u0084U(z);v ,k\u0085a, where\nA(z1L)5A(z). We require the perturbation to remain fi-\nnite as z!6`; standard theory then shows that a(z;v ,k)\nitself must be L periodic. If there exists such a periodic\nsolution for a pair (v ,k) with v.0, then the underlying\nwave solution U is unstable towards a mode with wave num-\nber k in the transverse direction. If no periodic solutions exist\nfor any positive w , then U is ~usually! stable @29#. Let Q(z)\ndenote a fundamental solution of the linear system. Then the\nexistence of a periodic solution requires the period-advance\nmapping M5Q(z1L)Q(z)21 to have at least one eigen-\nvalue ~Floquet multiplier! of unity.\nIn general, analytical expressions for the monodromy ma-\ntrix M will not be available, and for Eqs. ~1!\u2013~3! not even\nthe unperturbed state U(z) can be obtained explicitly. Hence\nthe above procedure, though applicable in principle, can only\nbe carried out using repeated numerical integration, so that\nthe parameter dependence of a potential instability cannot\neasily be established ~cf. @6#!. ~Problems of similar nature are\nencountered in the analysis of transverse front or pulse insta-\nbilities in chemical systems, and various attempts to circum-\nvent these have been made @30,31#.! We now derive a sim-\nplified model from Eqs. ~1!\u2013~3! which allows explicit\nstability calculations for its periodic wave solutions.\nIII. GEOMETRICAL MODEL\nOF WAVE CELL INTERACTION\nIntuitively, the interaction of cell movement dynamics\nand cAMP waves involves two crucial effects. First, propa-\ngation speed and amplitude of the cAMP waves will depend\non the local cell density. This may be important, as small\ndeviations from the average uniform density will always be\npresent. Second, these inhomogeneities will in turn feed back\ninto cell movement ~determining the cell distribution!, as\ncells will be attracted by the local peaks in the cAMP land-\nscape. To describe this interaction, the details of the u and\nand v fields are not strictly necessary; in principle, the\nknowledge of the u-concentration contours of the wave\nfronts and their cell density dependence would be sufficient.\nExploiting the disparate time scales of the u and v kinetics,\nthe problem of wave motion can be reduced to the motion ofinterfaces with rapidly changing values of u ~wave fronts and\nwave backs!, joining regions of practically constant, high, or\nlow values of u ~U1 and U2 in Fig. 2! @32#. For the motion\nof the wave fronts, one obtains a parabolic eikonal equation;\nin two dimensions, it reads\ncn5c2DK . ~4!\nHere c , cn and K denote the speed of a planar front, the\nnormal speed of a curved front and the local curvature, re-\nspectively. To construct a model of aggregation, we use Eq.\n~4! in place of Eqs. ~1! and ~2! and couple it with the chemo-\ntaxis equation ~3! via a modified \u2018\u2018chemotaxis rule.\u2019\u2019 The\ncell-density dependence of cAMP synthesis, @a(n)# , will re-\nsult in a \u2018\u2018constitutive relation\u2019\u2019 c(n).\nFor wave fronts that are close to a planar front, we can\norient the coordinate system such that the front position is\ndescribed by x5x\u00af(y ,t); we write x\u00af to distinguish the front\nposition from the independent space variable. In this case,\nusing the standard expressions for curvature and normal of a\ncurve \u0084x(t),y(t)\u0085, the eikonal equation ~4! can be recast in\nthe form\nx\u00aft5\nDx\u00afyy\n11x\u00afy\n2 1cA11x\u00afy2. ~5!\nClearly, this is solved by a planar wave, x\u00af(t)5x01ct . In the\noriginal derivation, Eq. ~5! describes the narrow, \u2018\u2018boundary\nlayer\u2019\u2019 wave front, with a typical width of order l21 in the\nappropriate scaling. Here we will relax this interpretation and\nassume all u contours to obey Eq. ~5!. This trivially holds for\na planar front, and as we will be concerned with small per-\nturbations around planar waves, this assumption appears rea-\nsonable. Thus Eq. ~5! now defines a continuous field of u\ncontours. To make this idea explicit, we interpret x0 as a\nparameter specifying the concentration contour, and thus for\neach contour we have x\u00af5x\u00af(x0 ,y ,t). Specifically, we may\nchoose the parametrization x05x . Introducing the traveling\nframe z5x1ct , we transform from (x ,y ,t) to (z ,y ,t) coor-\ndinates, to obtain\nx\u00aft52cx\u00afz1\nDx\u00afyy\n11x\u00afy\n2 1cA11x\u00afy2. ~6!\nThis equation has the plane wave solution x\u00af5z , representing\na continuum of parallel contour lines, parametrized by the\ntraveling wave coordinate, which are stationary in the z\nframe.\nThe evolution of the cell density is governed by Eq. ~3!.\nIn the present model, we replace the specific choice of the\nchemotactic cell velocity, w5x(v)\u0093u , with a similar\n\u2018\u2018chemotaxis rule\u2019\u2019 using the cAMP front contours. Trans-\nformation of Eq. ~3! to (z ,y ,t) coordinates yields\nnt5m~nzz1nyy!2cnz2~]z ,]y!\u0095~nw!. ~7!\nThe orienting influence of the cAMP gradient and the peri-\nodic character of cell movement are encapsulated in the fol-\nlowing definition for w. When a specific cAMP contour x\u00aff ,\nmarking the beginning of a wave front, reaches a location in\nthe field of amoebae, the amoebae at this location start to\nmove with constant speed w0 for a fixed time interval Dt ,\nbeing equal to the duration of the wave front, perpendicular\nto the cAMP contours:\n2078 56THOMAS HO\u00a8 FER AND PHILIP K.

However, in more complex models employing detailed\nintracellular dynamics, one can find more complicated rela-\ntionships, typically showing an increasing c(n) for small\ndensities with a slight decrease or an approximately constant\nregion for higher values of n @7,25#. The experimental results\nin @7# show an increase with cell density. However, wave\nspeed was only measured for two different densities and so it\nis difficult to infer a continuous relationship c(n).\nEquations ~6!\u2013~9! constitute the model of the cell wave\ninteraction. It is possible to obtain order-of-magnitude esti-\nmates of the parameters from the experimental literature. We\nhave c'400 mm\/min, w0'20 mm\/min, D'104 mm2\/min,\nand m'70 mm2\/min ~cf. @6#!; with space and time scales of\n200 mm and 5 min, respectively, this gives c0510, w0\n50.5, D51, and m51022.\nPlanar periodic traveling waves (X ,N) are y- and\nt-independent solutions of system ~6!\u2013~9!.

INSTABILITY OF PLANAR WAVES\nNow introduce the perturbation of the planar wave\nsolution x\u00af(z ,y ,t)5X(z)1 x\u02c6 exp$vt1iky%, n(z ,y ,t)5N(z)\n1 n\u02c6(z ,y ,t)exp$vt1iky%. Relation ~9! is simply expanded c\n5c0(n0)1c1(n0) n\u02c6 , where we take the coordinate frame to\nmove with c0 , z5x1c0t . From direct simulations of Eqs.\n~1!\u2013~3!, we can estimate c1'5 for the parameter set of Fig.\n1~b! @16#. In a first approximation, we assume that cell\nmovement still sets in at z5 jL , irrespective of perturbations\nof the fronts. Under this assumption, we obtain the following\nlinear system for ( x\u02c6 , n\u02c6):\nd\ndj S x\u02c6~11W~j!\/c0!n\u02c6 D5S 2v2k\n2D c1\nk2W~j!N~j! 2v2k2m D S x\u02c6n\u02c6 D ,\n~12!where we have rescaled z5c0j . Noting that m\/c0\n2!1, we\nhave neglected the term\n2\nm\nc0\n2\nd2\ndj2 S 0n\u02c6 D\non the right-hand side of Eq. ~12!. It can be shown that this\nperturbation, albeit singular, retains the solutions relevant for\nthe stability of underlying wave solutions in the perturbed\nsystem ~12! @28#. In addition, we verified in sample calcula-\ntions that the effect of the perturbation on the solutions of\nEq. ~12! is indeed small @16#.\nEquation ~12! has the principal structure du\/dj5A1u\nfor jPI j\n1 and du\/dj5A2u(j) for jPI j2 , where I j1\n5\u0084jL ,( j1a)L\u0085, I j25\u0084( j1a)L ,( j11)L\u0085, j50,1,2, . . . ,\na[z1 \/L , and A6 are constant regular matrices. This spe-\ncial, piecewise constant, case of a linear system with periodic\ncoefficients can be treated analytically as follows. Denote the\nfundamental solutions for the I6 intervals by Q6. They have\nthe form Q6(j)5Z6diag$eli6j%C6, where Z6 and l i6 are\nthe matrices of eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues,\nrespectively; C6 are constant matrices. The fundamental\nsolution for a complete period L can be found by match-\ning these at j5( j1a)L , requiring Q1\u0084( j1a)L\u0085\n5Q2\u0084( j1a)L\u0085. From this one obtains the monodromy ma-\ntrix M5Q(z1L)Q(z)21, as\nM5~Z1C1!21Z2diag$el i\n2\n~ j11 !L%\n3@Z2diag$el i\n2\n~ j1a!L%#21Z1diag$el i\n1\n~ j1a!L%C1. ~13!\nFor Eq. ~12! there exists a straightforward correspondence\nbetween the spectrum of ~maximal! growth rates v(k2) and\nthe spectrum of maximal Floquet multipliers, s(v ,k2),\nwhich allows the stability properties of system to be estab-\nlished in a compact manner. Realizing that the monodromy\nmatrix has the structure M5M0exp$2vL%, where M0 is the\nmonodromy matrix corresponding to v50, one can easily\nshow that\nv~k2!5L21lns~0,k2!. ~14!\nHence all we need to calculate is the spectrum of M0 from\nEqs. ~10! and ~13!. One of the two eigenvalues lies always in\nthe interval ~21,1!, while the modulus of the other,\ns~0,k2!5 12 @ trM01~ tr2M024 detM0!1\/2# , ~15!\ncan be greater than 1. One obtains trM05@k2(l112l21)(m\n2D)#21@(l111k2D)(l211k2m)(e (l1\n1\n2k2m)aL1e (l2\n1\n2k2D)aL)\n2(l111k2m)(l211k2D)(e (l1\n1\n2k2D)aL 1 e (l2\n1\n2k2m)aL)],\ndetM05exp$2k2(m1D)L%, and l1,21 5 12 $2k2(D1m)\n6@k4(D2m)214k2c1w0n1#1\/2%. Inserting these expressions\nin Eq. ~15!, one can show that a positive growth rate v(k2)\nis obtained if and only if\ntrM0.11detM0 . ~16!\nThis implies that an instability is associated with s passing\nthrough 1 and, consequently v(k2) being always real, pre-\ndicting the growth of a stationary pattern transverse to the\nwave fronts. The homogeneous mode k50 is always a neu-\ntral mode, due to the conservation of total cell number. Thus\nwe can expect an instability to set in at large wavelengths,\n56 2079STREAMING INSTABILITY OF SLIME MOLD AMOEBAE: AN . . .and expanding Eq. ~16! about k250, one finds that the peri-\nodic waves are unstable towards large wavelengths for\nc1n1w0.0 and stable for c1n1w0<0. Hence, in this simpli-\nfied model, the presence of chemotactic cell movement com-\nbined with a \u2018\u2018positive\u2019\u2019 dependence of cAMP wave speed\non cell density, c15dc(n)\/dn.0, always leads to an insta-\nbility. This result is a clear confirmation of the assertion of\n@4,7#.\nThe actual range of unstable modes and associated growth\nrates can be inferred from the dispersion relation v(k2). For\nsufficiently large cAMP wave periods L@@k2(D1m)#21, it\nis well approximated by\nv~k2!'\na\n2 @2k\n2~D13m!1Ak4~D2m!214k2c1n1w0#;\n~17!\nsample calculations show that even for small k and L5O~1!\nEq. ~17! is rather close to the actual dispersion relation ~cf.\nFig. 3!. @In Eq. ~17! was assumed that m,D as estimated\nabove; the relation for m.D is found by interchanging m\nand D .# Relation ~17! predicts a range of unstable wave\nnumbers 0,k2,c1n1w0 \/@2m(m1D)# with a single maxi-\nmum; or, alternatively, a mode k2.0 is unstable, if\nc1w0n1.2k2m~m1D !, ~18!\nand stable otherwise. Typical dispersion relations are shown\nin Fig. 3.\nFor realistic parameter values ~c155, n151, w050.5!,\nwe have a maximum growth rate of about 0.19 ~or\n0.04 min21! and a dominant wave number of ;3.7 ~or a\nwavelength of 340 mm!. Given a typical cell diameter of\nabout 10 mm, the analysis thus predicts the formation of\nclusters of a few cells. This happens on a relatively slow time\nscale; the linear doubling time of the patterning amplitude is\nequivalent to the passage of three to four cAMP pulses.\nV. DISCUSSION\nA. Comparison with model simulations\nThe analysis can be thought of as investigating a situation\nin which stable periodic waves exist ~e.g., for w050! and\nthen a parameter is switched to render the waves unstable\n(w0.0). The natural situation of aggregation is of course\nsomewhat different. Here the waves are \u2018\u2018switched on\u2019\u2019 and\nstart to propagate from distinct sources, and the combined\ndynamics of cAMP signaling and cell movement are un-\nstable from the outset. Therefore the instability develops as\nthe wave patterns expand. It will become visible first in the\nneighborhood of the aggregation centers, propagating out-\nwards with the waves. This conjecture is borne out both by\nexperiments and model simulations @Figs. 1~a! and 1~b!, re-\nspectively#.\nThe stability analysis is confined to patterning perpen-\ndicular to the direction of wave propagation and does not\naddress the issue of pattern selection on the two-dimensional\ndomain. However, it is intuitive that the distortions of the\nwave fronts cause continuous cell streams to form. The pres-\nence of a dominant wave number provides a recipe for a\nbranching network of cell streams in the quasicircular geom-\netry of an aggregation territory. Evidence of a dominant spa-tial wavelength of the emerging stream pattern has been ob-\ntained in model simulations @6,16#. The model simulations\nappear to match the experimental results, but a quantitative\nanalysis of the experimental patterns is lacking at present.\nB. Comparison with previous stability analyses\nStarting from a rather different set of assumptions, the\nmodel ~6!\u2013~9! yields essentially the same dispersion relation\nas the previous analysis in @6#. The analysis of @6# did not\nincorporate wave front curvature explicitly; it was based on\nfollowing the amplitudes of u , v , and n in Eqs. ~1!\u2013~3!\nperpendicular to the direction of wave propagtion as a per-\nturbation of the periodic planar wave is being introduced.\nThe close correspondence between the results of the two\nanalyses also extends to the instability criteria. By means of\na rough, qualitative, \u2018\u2018caricature\u2019\u2019 of the numerical stability\ncalculations of Eqs. ~1!\u2013~3!, in @6# the following instability\ncriterion was derived: Periodic waves are unstable if\npn0x0.2m~k2D1gn0!. ~19!\nHere p , n0 , x0 , and g denote a measure of the production\nrate of cAMP, the unperturbed initial cell density, the\nchemotactic coefficient ~being proportional to cell speed!,\nand the degradation rate of cAMP; the meaning of m and D\nis the same as in the present model. Thus in both models it is\nthe competition between the combined effect of cAMP pro-\nduction and chemotactic cell movement, on the one hand,\nand the dissipative effects of random cell movement and\ncAMP diffusion @and cAMP degradation in Eq. ~19!#, on the\nother, that determines whether the streaming instability oc-\ncurs.\nThe two approaches to stability analysis in the present\npaper and in @6# therefore emphasize complementary features\nof the instability mechanism, and the exclusive focus on\ncAMP wave front curvature in @4,7# appears somewhat one\nsided. For streaming to occur, it is important that local\ncAMP synthesis increase with cell density. This will mani-\nfest itself both in local front curvature ~i.e., propagation\nspeed! and cAMP amplitude.\nIt is not straightforward to see where the discrepancy with\nthe results in @9#, and in particular the very different shape of\nthe dispersion relation, arises, since they are obtained by a\nFIG. 3. Dispersion relations, v(k2)5L21lns(0,k2), for L52,\na50.1, m50.01, D51, and in ascending order c1n1w050, 0.5, 1.5,\nand 2.5. The dashed curve shows the approximation ~17! for\nc1n1w052.5.\n2080 56THOMAS HO\u00a8 FER AND PHILIP K. MAINInumerical procedure. In addition, the detailed forms of the\nchemotaxis terms differ in the models of @9,6# and the\npresent model. In @9# separate dynamics are assumed for w in\nthe wave fronts, dw\/dt52Gw1k\u0093u , while in @6# w}\u0093u\nin the wave fronts. Here Eq. ~8! corresponds essentially to\nw5w0\u0093u\/i\u0093ui . Hence in all three models the direction of\ncell movement follows the cAMP gradient, but in the present\nmodel the speed is constant rather than gradient dependent.\n~This latter assumption in the present model is forced by the\ncontour description of the cAMP waves which retains the\ndirection but not the magnitude of the chemical gradients; a\nconstant \u2018\u2018intrinsic\u2019\u2019 speed may actually be more realistic\nbiologically.! This may account for differences in detail.\nHowever, the agreement of the results of the present analysis\nwith that of @6# together with the evidence from model simu-\nlations argues strongly in favor of a generic single-humped\ndispersion relation.\nC. Conclusion\nThe \u2018\u2018pattern\u2019\u2019 of the instability criteria ~18! and ~19! em-\nphasizes the connection of the streaming instability with the\nchemotactic instability found in a simpler system by Keller\nand Segel @33#. @In the Keller-Segel system, actively moving\nparticles, such as cells ~described by a continuous density!,collect in clusters separated by a characteristic distance by\nresponding chemotactically to a signal they emit in a con-\ntinuous fashion.# In this sense, the streaming instability is a\nchemical-wave-driven chemotactic instability. This is further\nunderlined by another feature of aggregation, namely, the\nprogressive \u2018\u2018coarsening\u2019\u2019 of the initial pattern, seen both in\nvivo and in model simulation ~cf. Fig. 1!. Such a coarsening\nhas also been observed in simulations of a discrete-particle\nanalog of the Keller-Segel system @34#. Similar phenomena\nare found in other types of aggregative patterning, such as\ndendritic growth @35#.\nRecently, there have been experimental studies of other\nmicrobial systems in which chemotactic instabilities are\nlikely to be involved in the formation of collective cell pat-\nterns @36\u201338#. Moreover, the modeling approach presented\nhere may be applied to other excitable systems in which\nwave propagation alters the state of the medium.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nT.H. thanks Markus Ba\u00a8r, Matthias Bode, and Jonathan\nSherratt for fruitful discussions, and gratefully acknowledges\nsupport from the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds and Balliol\nCollege, Oxford.@1# M.
