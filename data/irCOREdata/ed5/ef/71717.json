Within the context of debates about integrated and \nterritorial approaches to rural development in Europe\u2019s \u2018lagging regions\u2019, this paper \nintroduces the notion of \u2018Integrated Rural Tourism\u2019 (IRT) and describes the various \nmethods of research used in an EU research project that forms the basis of this special \nedition.  IRT is theorised as tourism explicitly linked to the economic, social, cultural, \nnatural and human structures of the localities in which it takes place. The argument is \nthat IRT \u2013 as a theory and approach \u2013 leads to more sustainable tourism (broadly \nconceived) than other forms of tourism because it creates powerful network \nconnections between social, cultural, economic and environmental resources.  The \nnotion of IRT is also intended to open up practical ways of thinking about improving \nlinkages between tourism and local and regional resources, activities, products and \ncommunities in the light of changing trends in tourism demand.  \n \nKEY WORDS: Integrated rural tourism, lagging rural regions, rural development, \nSPRITE \n 4\nIntroduction \nThis paper introduces the notion of \u2018Integrated Rural Tourism\u2019 (IRT) in the context of \nSPRITE, an EU Fifth Framework research project.  Endnotes 1 and 2 provide details \nof this six-nation project.  The paper explores previous research in rural tourism and \nestablishes the case for an integrated approach to understanding its complex nature \n(environmental, economic and social) and the role it plays in all these dimensions of \nthe lives of local actors.  Current academic and policy debates advocating a more \nintegrated and territorial approach to rural development in Europe question the pre-\neminent position of agriculture within rural economies (Goodman 2004; Ward and \nLowe 2004). While rurality is seen as a space with multiple functions that extends \nbeyond food production, agriculture is recast as a component of a wider and more \nterritorial approach to rural development (Marsden et al. 2002). Increasingly, \ndifferentiated rurality stems from the shifting agenda in contemporary European \nagricultural policy seeking to challenge the classic sectoral vision.  While agriculture \nremains central to new visions of rural development, policy discussions about ways to \nreform the CAP, particularly its \u2018second pillar\u2019 (the Rural Development Regulation \n1257\/99), call upon European agriculture to \u201cplay a productive and market function, a \nterritorial management function, an environmental and management function, as well \nas a rural development function\u201d (Buller et al. 2000). The idea is to encourage rural \ncommunities to incorporate new sources of income as complements to rather than \nsubstitutes for existing activities Thus there is not only a shift in European agricultural \npolicy away from the previous \u2018agrarian\u2019 green ideology and towards a more \n\u2018ecological\u2019 green ideology which encourages environmentally feasible methods of \nproduction, but also an emphasis on the development of new niche consumer markets \n 5\nlikely to impact positively on rural economies (Ilbery and Kneafsey 2000; Baker \n2005). This new multi-functional countryside requires strategies that promote \nproactive networks of actors leading to community-wide ownership of solutions; \nimproved awareness of opportunities; the resolution or amelioration of conflicts \namong actors; the planning and implementation of resource-use practices that lead to \ntheir sustainable use and sensible management; the development of new \ncomplementary institutional arrangements; and the establishment of an interactive \nparticipative process that links policy formulation and implementation so that lessons \nlearnt are incorporated in the policy process (Bellamy and Johnson 2000; Patterson et \nal. 2004; Johannesen and Skonhoft 2005). In parallel to these changes of approach to \nagriculture, an integrated approach to managing rural tourism is proposed that \nencompasses, for example, the recognition of nonlinear processes and connectivity \nbetween actors, activities and resources. It comprises a long-term perspective with a \nbroad spatial focus, recognising the relevance of the human and cultural context and \ndiversity of values relating to tourism growth and development. In particular, the \nnature of rural networks in resource-poor lagging rural regions is discussed with a \nview to providing pathways for greater dialogue and shared responsibility among \nstakeholders. The paper outlines the key actors included in the surveys, the different \nresearch methods used and the various case-study areas.  \n \nPrevious Research on Rural Tourism \nThere have been many approaches to the analysis and fuller comprehension of rural \ntourism as both an economic sector and a socio-cultural practice (Jenkins and Oliver \n2001).  Previous models in rural tourism identified in the literature include: \n 6\n\u2022 core\/periphery approaches (Selwyn 1996; Weaver 1998; Russo 2005); \n \n\u2022 consumerist approaches, whereby tourists consume places (Urry 1995) and \n\u2018otherness\u2019 as \u2018positional goods\u2019 (Hirsch, 1978; Cloke and Little 1997) or are in \npursuit of novel aesthetic and material commodities (Lash and Urry 1994); \n\u2022 commercialisation approaches (whether tourism\u2019s features are endogenous or \nexogenous, and viable or non-viable) (Cohen 1993); \n\u2022 existential approaches, whereby tourists seek a transcendence from everyday life \n(Turner and Ash 1975), or seek to reconstitute an (often mythical) sense of \nwholeness, authenticity and structure which has been undermined by modernity \nand globalisation (MacCannell 1989; Selwyn 1996; Robinson and Boniface \n1999); \n\u2022 dramaturgical or performative approaches (Boorstin 1964) where tourists and their \nhosts act out roles and re-imaginings (Goffman 1975; Ryan and Aicken 2005) and \nthe \u2018geographies of display\u2019 (Crang 1998), and where tourism even becomes a \n\u2018game\u2019 or a \u2018virtual experience\u2019 (Feifer 1985; Tulloch 1999); \n\u2022 economic approaches, consumer-oriented (Ashworth and Goodall 1990), and \nwhere tourism can be economically harmful, a stimulant or redistributive (Tisdell \n2000); \n\u2022 community-focused approaches, whereby tourists intrusively seek authenticity \n(MacCannell 1989), and where tourism ranges from being culturally exploitative \nand destructive to having a \u2018desegregational\u2019 role (Lanquar 1990) or to being a \ncatalyst for the restoration or maintenance of traditions (Scheyvens 2002); \n\u2022 sustainability approaches (Wahab and Pigram 1997), however, the concept of \nsustainable tourism is often somewhat incoherent, given the lack of consensus \n 7\nover its meaning and development of indicators to monitor its progress (Cater \n1994; Miller and Twining-Ward 2005). \n \nNone of these approaches seems wholly satisfactory in the context of IRT which is \nnot merely a tool to facilitate greater coordination among actors but also involves \nroles and responsibilities associated with both the implementation and the monitoring \nof tourism development strategies, and resource management at the local and regional \nlevel. Each of the above approaches tends to privilege one sector or discipline and \nhence one set of interactions and interests. However, the key feature of rural tourism \nis its pervasiveness in the lives of tourists, businesses and host communities, and the \nassociated \u2018\u2018duty of care\u2019\u2019 on the part of stakeholders to use and manage resources \nsustainably. Hence this paper has adopted an integrated and inter-disciplinary \napproach to the study of rural tourism as experienced across Europe, to overcome the \nlimitations of previous approaches and better address the issues of equity, social \njustice, and actor expectations of accountability in tourism management (Endnote 1).  \n \nIntegration and rural tourism \nThere has been considerable academic and policy debate around a more sectorally \nintegrated and territorial approach to European rural development. Current policy \nmovements such as the Agenda 2000 reforms, Rural Development Regulation \n1257\/99, the mid-term (2003) review of the Common Agriculture Policy and the \nWorld Trade Organisation talks in 2004-6 are exposing rural areas to global markets \nand competition, particularly in the hitherto protected agricultural sector.  Moreover, \nsupport to rural lagging economies will no longer be viewed in a principally \n 8\nagricultural context, but in broader terms encompassing other sectors important to the \nrural economy, namely food processing, light manufacturing, arts, crafts and tourism.  \nThe pivotal position of tourism in this context arises because many of the products \nand resources of lagging rural regions potentially have very strong linkages with \ntourism.  Tourism and other products, such as crafts and foods, can be marketed \ntogether as a form of linked exploitation of rural and regional production and imagery.  \nTourism can permeate, and be integrated with, local and regional economies in a \ncomplex manner, which leads to direct income benefits for localities and to wider \ndevelopmental benefits based on association, synergy and participation (Jenkins and \nOliver 2001).  Within this context, the aim of this paper is to introduce and explore \nthe notion of Integrated Rural Tourism (IRT) as a tool for rural development. \n \nWhile the concept of \u2018integration\u2019, together with analogous concepts such as \n\u2018partnerships\u2019, is used pervasively, it is clear that the concept is understood in a \nnumber of different ways. These include: \n1. spatial integration, as in the integration of core tourist areas with areas where \ntourism is less well developed (Weaver 1998); \n2. human resource integration, as in the integration of working people into the \neconomy as a means of combating social exclusion (by education and training, for \nexample) and gaining competitive advantage (Mulvaney et al. 2007);  \n3. institutional integration, as in the integration of agencies into partnerships or other \nformal semi-permanent structures (Selin and Beason 1991; Vernon et al. 2005);  \n 9\n4. innovative integration, as in the integration of new ideas and processes into the \ntourism \u2018product\u2019 to achieve growth or competitive advantage (Macbeth et al. \n2004); \n5. economic integration, as in the integration of other economic sectors with tourism, \nparticularly retailing and farming (Dudding and Ryan 2000; Veeck et al. 2006)  \n6. social integration, as in the integration of tourism with other trends in the socio-\neconomy, notably the drive for quality and concerns for environmental \n(particularly landscape) protection and sustainable development (Kneafsey 2001); \n7. policy integration, as in the integration of tourism with broader national and \nregional goals for economic growth, diversification and development (Dredge \n2006); \n8. temporal integration, as in the integration of the past with current economic, social \nand cultural needs and requirements, especially through the commodification of \nheritage (Ryan and Aicken 2005); and \n9. community integration, as in the integration of tourists into local communities as \n\u2018guests\u2019, such that they occupy the same physical spaces, satisfy their existential \nand material needs in the same manner, and become embedded in the same value \nchains as members of the host society (Oakes, 1999). \n \nClearly, therefore, the term \u2018integration\u2019 \u2013 while not a new one \u2013 is both fluid and \nevolving. Also, it should be noted that these usages of the term \u2018integration\u2019 are \noverlapping and are used interchangeably in the literature. The SPRITE project \nattempted to analyse rural tourism across all the dimensions that potentially can be \nintegrated and this set of papers reports some of the results. \n 10\nThe concept of integration has gained currency in the tourism literature, particularly \nwith reference to tourism planning and management (Gunn 1988; Innskeep 1991; \nButler 1999; Youell 2003). Research into sustainable tourism emphasises integrating \nenvironmental concerns into tourism (Wahab and Pigram 1997).  Authors have also \naddressed ways of integrating economy and culture with tourism to achieve a \nfunctionally successful community, in both ecological and human terms (Priestly et \nal. 1996; Stabler 1997).  More recently, the importance of local participation and \ncontrol has been recognised, with integration defined according to the percentage of \nlocal people employed, the type and degree of participation, the locus of decision-\nmaking power and ownership of resources in the local tourism sector (Stem et al. \n2003; Briedenhann and Wickens 2004).  This can be seen in the recomposition of \nrural populations and the diversification of farm families' incomes.  \n \nIn this paper, the concept of IRT is proposed as a means of thinking critically and \ncomprehensively about the actors, resources and relationships involved in this \nnotoriously fragmented industry.  We define IRT as tourism that is explicitly linked to \nthe economic, social, cultural, natural and human resources of the localities in which \nit takes place (Jenkins and Oliver 2001). Some actors may be \u2018more\u2019 or \u2018less\u2019 \nintegrated into tourism than others.  Accommodation providers, for example, may be \nwell integrated into the local tourism product, whereas a speciality cheese producer \nmay be less integrated even if some tourists buy the cheese.  The notion of integration \nprovides a means of thinking about ways of bringing diverse actors, networks and \nresources together more successfully into networks of co-operation and collaboration \n(Saxena 2005).  Moreover, the idea of IRT should encourage a holistic \n 11\nconceptualisation of tourism, which in turn suggests a research methodology that \nseeks to engage with multiple actors and networks involved in its constitution.  \n \nNotionally, the benefits of IRT are likely to be wide-ranging and can comprise both \nstatic and dynamic benefits, some of which can be quantified and others which are \nbest analysed qualitatively.  The potential benefits can be categorised under five \nheadings. \nDirect economic benefits  Integrative linkages between tourism and local economies \nhave considerable potential to increase the value added to, and reduce the value \nleakage from rural areas, leading to improved income and employment multipliers. \nExperiential benefits  Complementary approaches to marketing and packaging of \nproducts and services should provide visitors \/ tourists with a distinctively local and \nquality package of products and services, resulting in better experiences for both \ntourists and host communities. \nConservation benefits  For example, IRT should improve the incentives for the \nconservation and regeneration of resources, both natural and human-made, through \ncloser cooperation among different actors and more actions on the ground.  This \nshould enhance recreation and tourism providers\u2019 capacity to engage in sustainable \ndevelopment. \nDevelopmental benefits  IRT can become a path to rural pluriactivity and rural \nmultifunctionality, providing valuable new opportunities for the development of \nlagging regions that go beyond a simple compensation for agricultural decline.  It can \npermit a wide range of local economic actors to benefit from the use of a locality\u2019s \nresources through stimulating positive local responses to market trends such as market \n 12\nsegmentation, niche marketing and new product development.  It can also allow for \nthe potentially beneficial exploitation of rural and regional imagery; \nSynergistic benefits  IRT provides an increased likelihood of co-ordinated and \nconsistent institutional policies for rural and regional development, and it should \nencourage partnerships among a range of local actors who can then reap wider \ndevelopmental benefits based on association, synergy and participation. \n \nAn often-overlooked fact in the debate about benefits via tourism is that, in many \nrural areas, the onus lies on small, family-centred enterprises and groups for its \npromotion and development. Typically they have a low capital base and function with \nlimited skills and experience. Also, they may be too specialist or in the wrong location \n(too remote) (Fleischer and Felsenstein 2000). This necessitates a renewed focus on \nstrategies that generate benefits for actors and on networks that reconnect these \napparently \u2018disconnected\u2019 actors in face-to-face proximities where obligations and \nadvantages go hand in hand. \n \nThus it is theorised that IRT is constructed through social networks of exchange that \nare embedded, empowering and endogenous (see Table 1 for definitions) but which \npossess the apparently contradictory ability to dis-embed themselves, where \nbeneficial.  In this paper, discussion on embeddedness, empowerment and \nendogeneity is presented, and the complexities of promoting embeddedness \/ \ndisembeddedness, empowerment and endogeneity in networks are explored. This is \nfollowed by an introduction to the study regions and a methodological discussion.   \n \n 13\nConceptualising networks and IRT \n \nIRT is forged through the construction of networks that enable actors to exploit and \nbarter resources such as local traditions, art forms, celebrations, experiences, \nentrepreneurship and knowledges.  Networks embrace a range of formal and informal \narrangements, from casual groupings of like-minded individuals to highly prescribed \nforums of organisations supported by paid staff, fiscal resources and communication \ntechnology (Saxena 2005).  However, networks are not pre-given social facts and can \nbe difficult to create, sustain and manage. Authors point to several dilemmas \nassociated with setting up a network (Dyer and Nobeoka 2000; Sch\u00f6nstr\u00f6m 2005). \nThese mainly include problems associated with motivating self-interested network \nmembers to participate in the network and to openly share valuable knowledge with \nother network members, eliminating free riders who enjoy the benefit of the public \ngood but without contributing any value themselves and maximising the efficiency of \nknowledge transfers among a large group of individual members. This implies that \nactors have to consciously engage in \u2018investment strategies\u2019 to create a strong identity \nwithin the network through processes of socio-economic bonding that facilitate the \ntransfer of both tacit and explicit knowledge and ensure long-term micro-interactions \n(Woolcock 1998; Falk and Kilpatrick 2000; J\u00f3hannesson et al. 2003).  These are \nfacilitated through both \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018strong\u2019 ties (Granovetter 1973, 1985).  Weak ties \nare made through highly formalised, short-term relationships.  Strong ties involve \nmuch closer relationships, are often repeated transactions, and are negotiated on the \nbasis of implicit understandings.  Bonding processes among actors are facilitated \nthrough socially meaningful relationships based on trust, giving advice or sharing \n 14\ninformation and \u2018influence acceptance\u2019, which is the degree to which exchange \npartners voluntarily change their strategies to accommodate the desires of other \npartners (Wellman and Gulia 1999; Saxena 2006).  \n \nNetworks enable actors to access information, search for, obtain and share resources, \nengage in co-operative actions for mutual benefit, develop collective vision, diffuse \nideas and mobilise resources with a view to attracting visitors.  This in turn can appeal \nto inward investors, increase local pride and counter negative perceptions (Powell and \nSmith-Doerr 1994; Bramwell and Rawling 1996).  Following Flury (1999), Glosvik \n(2003), Rosenfeld (2003) Yates (2003) and Jack (2005), some of the attributes of \nnetworks operating in rural contexts can be summarised as follows.   \n \n1. They are more likely to be \u201csoft\u201d than \u201chard\u201d networks. Soft networks have open \nmembership, usually imply a \u2018cooperative\u2019 style of interaction or \u2018horizontal \nrelationships\u2019 and can consist of diverse members ranging from businesses and \norganisations to local NGOs, community groups and individuals. The latter are a \ncombination of hierarchical, cooperative and competitive modes of interaction that \ntake place to achieve specific shared business objectives such as the targeting of \nnew markets, joint product development, co-production, or co-marketing, and are \nlikely to require formal agreements for sharing profits or resources.   \n2. They are more likely to be driven by need or crisis with the intent of providing \npastoral and practical support to community members than by necessity to \ngenerate quick profit. \n 15\n3. They are less likely to become economically self-sufficient. Although sustained by \ncontribution of volunteers, most cannot support themselves on membership or \nservice fees alone and require financial  support from agencies for their core \nactivities. \n4. They tend to be cooperative in nature, with an emphasis on social norms and \nreciprocity, interpersonal ties of collegiality and friendship that help in serving a \nbroad range of interests in the community rather than focusing narrowly on \nspecific actions. \n5. They are non-hierarchical, but possibly vary in their potency (e.g. \u2018weak\u2019 or \n\u2018strong\u2019 ties). Strong ties sustain activity within the network and are used \nextensively to provide knowledge and information but also to maintain, extend and \nenhance business status and personal reputation. Strong ties also provide the \nmechanism to invoke \u2018weak\u2019 ties, represented by nodes operating in a wider social \ncontext. Hence, the value and strength of weak ties is not related to the weakness \nof the relationship, but in the possibility of connections to other networks. \n6.  They differ in the degree of formalisation (varying between explicit membership \nagreements and tacit understandings) and duration (short-or long-term \nrelationships). \n7. They are both open and closed.  Open networks are structured in a manner that \nallows members easy access to a broad range of services. They are readily \naccessible and due to their flexibility are able to capture knowledge externalities \nfrom other actors and networks which in turn contribute to acquisition of \nadditional sources of information and data (Creech and Willard 2001). Closed \nnetworks are collectivistic in nature and are characterised by an attitude of \u2018us \n 16\nversus them\u2019. However, this closeness among members facilitates transfer and \nexchange of tacit knowledge assisted through deep personal and social bonds and \ncollective values among network members (Coleman 1988; 1990; Putnam 1995).   \n \nIn addition to these general network attributes, we draw on ideas from rural \ndevelopment research to suggest that, for successful IRT to occur, rural networks \nmust also be simultaneously embedded and disembedded, endogenous and \nempowering. As such, our research goes some way towards disturbing the \nconventional (and in the authors\u2019 view excessively) binary understandings of these \nterms, which are briefly summarised in Table 1 (Kneafsey, et al. forthcoming).  \nTable 1. Binary understandings of network characteristics \n \nEmbedded \nEmbedded networks are built around \nlocal knowledges and relationships. They \ncan form the basis for innovative \nactivities originating from locally specific \nconventions.  But they may lack \ndynamism. \nDisembedded \nDisembedded networks can facilitate \naccess to external markets. However, \nwithout careful labelling and traceability \nsystems, disembedded local products and \nresources risk \u2018losing\u2019 their distinctive \norigins and production processes.  \nEndogenous \nEndogenous networks reinforce strong \nattachment to place, promoting local \nparticipation and ownership of resources \nand retention of value added. But they \nmay lack access to superior external \nresources.  \nExogenous \nExogenous networks enable actors to \naccess human and monetary resources not \navailable locally, and provide channels \nfor getting local interests onto \nmainstream agendas. However, by failing \nto link with local socio-economic \nstructures, they can create high economic \nleakage, leaving the economy vulnerable \nto external shocks.  \nEmpowering \nEmpowering networks facilitate local \nparticipation in managing physical, \ncultural and economic resources. But \nparticipation may be partial. \nDisempowering \nDisempowering networks are dominated \nby local, regional or national elites, with \ntheir large resources. But they may fail to \nestablish decision-taking systems \naccredited as representative and \naccountable. They offer limited \n 17\nopportunities for community \ndevelopment and participation.   \n \nNetworks contributing to IRT development are embedded in particular localities, \nalthough the extent of their geographical reach and complexity may vary.  In our use \nof the term embeddedness we are seeking to emphasise the territorial context in which \nnetwork formation takes place, reinforcing cultural identity constructions through the \ncreation of distinctions between \u2018\u2018insiders\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018outsiders\u2019\u2019. Thus embeddedness \nsuggests not only that resources or activities are directly linked to place, but that \nrelationships are also formed within particular socio-cultural contexts in specific \nlocalities. The unique socio-cultural characteristics and identities, which are \nembedded in place, help to shape relationships and networks and create psycho-\nemotional bonds between the individual and the place by providing repertories of \nshared values, symbols, and traditions (Hinrichs 2000; Murdoch 2000; Kneafsey et al. \n2001; Palmer 2003). The premise is that areas can specialise around local clusters of \neconomic activity, exploit comparative advantages, and even out-shine urban regions, \nespecially those that lack the requisite advantages and institutional thickness (Amin \nand Thrift, 1994). However, it is to be noted that whilst tight social ties contribute to \nthe establishment of social norms, sanctions and trust, they may also be associated \nwith coercive relationships and attempts by socially dominant actors to control and \nthe free choice of members of the network. Uzzi (1997, p.59) warns of the implication \nof overly embedded networks for stifling economic action and releasing negative \nemotions. Thus tourism resources need a degree of disembeddness, since too much \nembeddedness can curtail the market reach of the local tourism product, which will \nthen remain marginal in relation to the globalised tourism sector. Conversely, \n 18\ndisembedded resources and activities may result in social and cultural detachment and \nhigh levels of economic leakage from the locality. Despite their positive role in \nexpanding the socio-economic life of rural businesses and resource controllers, they \ncan constrain tourism development by creating conditions that are at odds with the \ninterests, prospects and perspectives of communities in lagging regions (see Table 1).  \nFor instance, they can disembed market behaviour from a wider context of social \nrelations, norms and institutions. Disembedded networks potentially run the danger of \ngenerating structures of production and marketing that lead to the commoditisation of \npeople and natural and human artefacts by \u2018non-local actors\u2019 effecting change and \ncontrol from a distance (Murdoch and Marsden 1995).  Thus there is a real tension \nbetween the rhetoric of locality (i.e. social capital and local economic development) \nand the economic need to \u2018act global\u2019 (Marsden 1998). Hence, we argue that the \nnetworks contributing to IRT development can both embed economic action within \nlocal social and political practices and, at the same time, enable local products and \nservices to be disembedded in order to contact markets further afield.  \n \nIn order to limit the negative impacts of disembeddness, we propose that networks for \nIRT also need to be endogenous. Thus discourses on endogeneity are adopted that \nemphasise the retention of maximum benefits in a locality, by using and adding worth \nto local resources and by focusing on the requirements, capacities and values of local \npeople (Goodwin et al., 1999). The concept of endogeneity is closely linked to that of \nembeddedness, in that endogenous development is built around locally distinguishing \neconomic, environmental and cultural resources that can be utilised by innovators and \nentrepreneurs to establish a region\u2019s identity. The crucial point, however, is that \n 19\nendogenous development is structured to retain maximum benefits in a locality by \nusing and adding value to natural, economic, and sociocultural elements and focusing \non the needs , capacities and values of local people and the complex phenomenon of \ntradition that can be defined as the handing down of customs, beliefs, and ideas \nintergenerationally (Niessen 1999; Ray 2000). Endogenous development is conducted \nat a scale appropriate to local environmental and social resources and often \nincorporates complementary use of resources and should ideally lead to increased \npartnership and synergy. It encourages strong local participation in decision-making \nabout resource use and enables local actors to adapt external opportunities to their \nown needs (Long and Ploeg 1994). However, since local areas may not have the \npreconditions that are needed for learning, innovation and growth, too much reliance \non local initiative can limit their ability to benefit from possibilities for \u2018new \ncombinations\u2019 of global trends and local traditions, such as agrotourism, guided \nexcursions and innovative arts and crafts. Therefore , endogeneity rarely implies the \nabsence of external, exogenous elements, however remote a region may be.  It is a \nprocess of continuous (re)interpretation and (re)negotiation of both external and \ninternal elements by locals that allows for a continuous evolution of new forms of \nsurvival and forms of interaction with markets, technology, administration and natural \nresources, opening up the cross-cultural production of local meanings, self-images, \nrepresentations, and modes of life (Amin and Thrift 1994; Salazar 2005). However, \nnetworks that are overly exogenous can limit the integration of different stakeholders, \nlocal groups and individuals through initiating development processes that are \ntransplanted into a lagging rural region and externally determined, leading to the \nbenefits of development being exported from the region and local values being \n 20\ndamaged. Exogenous elements can limit local participation to mere \u2018tokenism\u2019 \n(Goodwin et al. 1999), negatively impacting on symbolically constructed \n\u201ccommunities\u201d or \u201cculture-territories\u201d, the obscuring of which may indirectly exclude \nand disempower some local actors if they do not feel affinity with the constructed \ncultural identity (Shortall 2004).  \n \nFollowing the inter-linked features of embeddedness and endogeneity, another \ncharacteristic of networks in IRT is that they are empowering. The notion of \nempowerment implies a crucial distinction between individual or psychological, \nempowerment and community empowerment. The former is concerned with \nindividuals\u2019 subjective experiences of the world, the extent to which they attribute \ntheir negative circumstances to social factors rather than personal failings, and the \nextent to which they feel they can control events in their own life (Gruber and Tricket \n1987). Community empowerment, on the other hand, is concerned with modifying the \nsocial structure to reallocate power between groups. The collective aspects of \nempowerment imply that the whole community benefits from being included in \ndecision making (Oxaal and Baden 1997; Oughton et al. 2003). The two elements of \nempowerment are interlinked, psychological empowerment being necessary to \nachieve community empowerment, although the reverse is not necessarily true. \nHowever, a fundamental paradox can be identified \u201cin the idea of people empowering \nothers because the very institutional structure that puts one group in a position to \nempower also works to undermine the act of empowerment\u201d (Gruber and Tricket, \n1987, p. 356). Institutional support for microcredit \/ microenterprise initiatives, for \nexample, can promote a narrowly individualistic definition of empowerment, which \n 21\nplaces importance on self-reliance and home-based income-generating activities \nwithout careful examination of the social context within which local communities \noperate (Thompson 1991; Camagni 1995). Powerlessness may also be reinforced by \nthe dominant policy discourses concerning rural communities\u2019 ability to engage in \nconcerted action. Thus for networks to be truly empowering, they need to act in a \nfacilitative or enabling role to enhance feelings of self-efficacy among members \nthrough the identification of conditions that foster powerlessness and through their \nremoval by both formal organisational practices and informal techniques of providing \nefficacy information (Conger 1989). In this way, the networks could empower rural \nactors by encouraging them to challenge and change the interpretations and stories \nthey tell about themselves. This also suggests that as a result of this discursive process \nthe existing boundaries between policy makers and local actors may become \nincreasingly blurred, allowing for more \u2018interconnectedness\u2019 between them.   \n \nIRT can thus be conceptualised as a web of networks of local and external actors, in \nwhich endogenous and embedded resources are mobilised in order to develop the \nassets and capabilities of rural communities and empower them to participate in, \ninfluence and hold accountable the actors and institutions that affect their lives.  \nWhilst this provides an analytical starting point, the realities of rural development are \noften more complex.  As will be demonstrated in the papers that follow, the \ncontradictory and multi-faceted dynamics of rural networks can create both \nopportunities and threats to the development of IRT.  \n \n 22\nA further key concept in IRT is that of scale (Ray 1998; Sharpley 1996). This implies \nthat the networks contributing to IRT are not static, but continuously change through \nthe addition and \/ or removal of new nodes and links. The rate at which nodes in a \nnetwork increase their connectivity depends on their fitness to compete for links. For \nexample, in social networks some individuals may acquire more social links than \nothers. We find that this competition for links translates into multi-scaling, i.e. a \nfitness-dependent dynamic exponent, allowing fitter nodes to overcome the more \nconnected but less fit ones (Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si 2001). Consequently, one has to \nbear in mind the dynamic forces that act at the level of individual nodes, whose \ncumulative effect determines the rural networks\u2019 large-scale topology. A step in this \ndirection is the acknowledgement of the fact that network evolution is driven by at \nleast two coexisting mechanisms: \u201c1) growth, implying that networks continuously \nexpand by the addition of new nodes; 2) preferential attachment, mimicking the fact \nthat a new node links with higher probability to nodes that already have a large \nnumber of links\u201d (Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si 2001, p. 436). Thus the concept of scale \npresents all the actors involved in tourism with important challenges in terms of both \nachieving their goals and reaching compromises with those differently minded.  \n  \nThe concept of sustainability is also relevant as the goal is to achieve sustainable \noutcomes through networks that balance social, economic and environmental \naspirations for communities and best equalise benefits and costs for key stakeholders, \nand do not deteriorate the quality of resources. Implicit within this argument is the \nintent to achieve harmony between modernity and tradition (Tracey and Clark, 2003). \nMirroring the close connection between culture and sustainability (Jenkins 2000), IRT \n 23\nis closely linked to the notion of sustainable development, a term that in itself is \nnormative and relative. The concept of sustainability is a useful \u2018guiding fiction\u2019 \nwhich stimulates and organises discourse around a problematic issue without the \nrigour of a precise definition (McCool and Moisey 2001) and which, seen as a process \n(Aronsson 2000), stimulates the need for economic, social, institutional and structural \nchange.  Further, the concept is multi-dimensional; interpreted in its broadest sense, it \nhas economic, socio-cultural, political, geographical and ecological aspects. The \neconomic aspect is primarily a matter of satisfying human material needs and goals; \nthe social and political aspects relate in general to questions of equality, justice and \ninfluence; the geographical aspects concern the spatial consequences of human \nbehaviour; and the ecological aspects involve the issue of protecting natural variety \nand preserving natural cycles.  The sustainable harnessing of resources and activities, \ntherefore, tends to lead inter alia to economic viability, and resource and socio-\ncultural conservation, while the unsustainable harnessing of resources and activities \ntends to lead to high rates of business failure and to resource and socio-cultural \ndeterioration.  \n \nIn many respects, \u2018IRT\u2019 overlaps with \u2018sustainable tourism\u2019, recent definitions of \nwhich are becoming increasingly holistic (Swarbrooke 1999; Sharpley 2000). Rather \nthan being concerned with just minimising tourism\u2019s impacts, the concept of \nsustainable tourism development has gradually broadened into a notion that now takes \ninto account the long-term viability of good quality natural and human resources, the \nquality of life for host communities, visitor satisfaction, and conservative use of \nnatural and social resources (Bramwell and Lane 2000; Robinson et al. 2000; Tosun \n 24\n2001). However, engagement with concepts listed as key in IRT development remains \nsomewhat limited in the sustainable tourism literature. Also, since sustainable tourism \ncan be interpreted (and once was) in a narrow sense of relating to the physical \nenvironment, we prefer to use the term IRT to avoid confusion. Thus while drawing \nupon the thinking behind sustainable tourism, IRT is robust in its focus upon a strong \nculture of mutual support and information exchange that link previously disparate \neconomic, social, cultural, natural and human activities and resources. This is \nessentially required to address fully the many concerns for tourism destinations, \nwhich are often unclear, multiple, conflicting, contested and continually shifting.  \nThey can impede progress towards achieving sustainable and integrated forms of \ntourism.  \n \nUnderstanding and writing clearly about the complex relationships between the \ndiverse range of actors involved in tourism continues to pose a challenge.  The \ninterplay between individual personalities, local specificities and global processes of \nchange still requires more research.  Relating more specifically to the notion of \nintegration, further investigation is needed to obtain a deeper understanding of the \nmechanisms that help to sustain the dis\/embedded, endogenous, and empowering \nattributes of networks (Kneafsey, et al. forthcoming).  Also needed is a way of \ndistinguishing the generic factors from those arising from unique case histories where \nlocal businesses, resource controllers and other actors shape IRT development in \ndetail.  Crucially, the creation of embedded and endogenous networks does not \nnecessarily result in empowerment for all concerned.  Issues of participation and \n 25\ninclusion remain central to the project of creating equitable, sustainable and integrated \ntourism development. \n \nSPRITE regions, actors and research methods \n \nOne of the objectives of SPRITE was to examine how IRT has developed in different \nareas.  Is it the case that different combinations of resources, skills and \npolitical\/administrative cultures (in general and towards tourism in particular) will \nhave led to different types of IRT?  To answer this question, research was conducted \nin the six countries of the participating research groups, namely the Czech Republic, \nFrance, Greece, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom.  The participating research \ngroups are listed in Endnote 2.  This set of countries includes large and small nations, \nricher and poorer ones, northern, southern and central European states, and those \nwhere tourism is more important in the national economy and those where it is less so.  \n \nWithin each country two study regions were selected (Figure 1).  Both were rural \nareas that had either Objective 1 or Objective 2 EU status because of their lagging \neconomies.  They were selected to provide national pairings of contrasting tourism \nsettings in terms of the scale or history of tourism development and the a priori \ndegree to which rural tourism was integrated into mainstream structures in the \nregions.  Figure 1 also shows those sub-regions with definable territorial names that \nwere selected for particular study when the research examined small-scale networks \nsuch as the effect of tourism on specific host communities.  \n \n \n 26\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

The tourists (excluding \nresidents and including day visitors and second home owners) form the demand side \nand in each region 100 were studied.  The businesses supply tourist services and \nproducts; 50 were studied in each region. Twenty institutions that promoted or \nregulated tourism were surveyed in each region.  Twenty resource controllers were \nresearched, these being agencies and individual actors controlling the supply of key \nresources for tourism such as finance, training or land.  Ten gatekeepers in each \nregion were investigated, these being groups which marketed the area\u2019s tourist \npotential, provided tourists with information and helped shape its image.  Finally 50 \n 28\nmembers of host communities in each region were included in the research to \ndetermine residents\u2019 perspective on various impacts of tourism.   \n \nThe predominant focus of SPRITE\u2019s research was on using qualitative research \nmethods to evaluate and analyse research findings (Patton 2002).  However, the data \ncollection methods used with each actor group varied according to the type of \ninformation needed and the nature of the respondents.  For example, the surveys of \nthe tourists were the most structured, although still providing scope for individual \nqualitative responses.  The discussions with the host communities were the most free-\nflowing; at times the researchers engaged in participative observation to gain further \ninsight into local networks and social relationships, although adequately addressing \nthe core of key conceptual themes (discussed earlier) to ensure comparability of \nresults among the 12 study regions.  Overall, three styles of recording field data \n(following Corsaro 1981) were found to be the most useful in guiding the survey \nwork:  In the field notes, a running account was made of the slowly unfolding research \nprocess helped by transcriptions of audiotapes. These guided the earliest phases of \nresearch and provided an overall representation of key issues in the sub-regions.  The \npersonal notes were where the researchers listed their own perceptions, self-\nreflections, memories, and impressions in the form of individual diaries, to identify \nlater their own possible influences on the data and the effects of personal events on \nthe data collection and analysis.  In the theoretical notes, emergent trends were \nrecorded, also including hunches to follow up later in the research. These helped in \nfurther refining the research focus and addressing concerns among actor-groups. \nTaken together, these surveys of the actors and their inter-relationships in formal and \n 29\ninformal local networks were chosen because of the way IRT is produced and \nconsumed, encouraged and restrained, and mediated and regulated as an economic, \nsocial and cultural practice.  \n \nHowever, one of the limitations of using qualitative methodology is the threat of \nconclusions based on the selection of data that fits the researchers\u2019 existing theory or \npreconceptions and the selection of data that \u2018stand out\u2019 to the researchers\u201d (Maxwell, \n1996). However, ongoing discussion with colleagues about the research process \nserved to stimulate researchers\u2019 reflections regarding this potential problem. \nNevertheless, the influence of the researchers on the subjects in the study is inevitable \nin qualitative interview process (Maxwell, 1996). However, the objective of the \nresearchers was to understand this influence not to eliminate it. Some general \nguidelines were followed to minimise this. The researchers avoided value-laden \nreactions to interview dialogue; and allowed subjects to lead the discussion as much \nas possible. \n \nFollowing this introductory paper, the articles brought together in this special issue of \nTourism Geographies are centred on the subject of how tourism actors in selected \nlagging rural regions across Europe have responded to the notion of IRT and its key \nconcepts. In particular, the attention is on strategies that use the interests of tourists in \nlocal culture to strengthen local identity. A striking characteristic of IRT is the way in \nwhich it promotes self-awareness, pride, self-confidence and solidarity among local \nactors, as most of the contributions to this special issue demonstrate. The papers \nwhich follow focus on key aspects of the research looking into various aspects of IRT.  \n 30\n\"Resources and activities complementarities: the role of business networks in the \nprovision of integrated rural tourism.\" (Petrou et al. 2007). This paper explains how \nnetworks of businesses can promote or limit the development of integration in rural \ntourism, using contrasting areas in the UK, Spain and Greece as comparators. \n \n\"Measuring integrated rural tourism\" (Clark and Chabrel 2007) devises a novel way \nof operationalising the multi-dimensional measurement of IRT so that one can \nidentify where in space, time and among actors IRT is being achieved. This allows \nIRT to become a usable policy tool as well as an academic concept \n \n\"A Decision Support System (DSS) for integrated tourism development: rethinking \ntourism policies and management strategies.\" (Bousset et al. 2007). A DSS for IRT \ncreates a novel model, based on empirical evidence from the actors, of scenarios \nwhich allows one to predict how different futures for IRT might be configured to \nmaximise overall public benefit from the sector.  It assesses the ease with which \nscenario development can be achieved.  \n \n\"Promoting integrated rural tourism: comparative perspectives on institutional \nnetworking in France and Ireland.\" (Cawley et al. 2007). Here, one examines the \ncontrasting roles of institutions of different sorts and scales in France and Ireland, \nparticularly how they are promoting or hindering the integration of rural tourism. The \npaper demonstrates the role of political context in shaping IRT development.  \n 31\n\"Exploring tourists and gatekeepers\u2019 attitudes towards Integrated Rural Tourism in the \nEngland \/ Wales Border Region.\" (Ilbery et al. 2007). This paper investigates the \nperceptions of tourists and gatekeepers (such as tour operators and destination \nmarketing organisations) on IRT, noting their role in consuming and marketing the \nmore recently acknowledged qualities of rurality such as farming, food processing, \ncreativity and the arts, heritage and outdoor recreation. \n \nTogether, these papers examine the steps that tourism actors in lagging regions have \ntaken either to deflect exogenous tourist developments in order to keep control of their \nown lives or to initiate endogenous tourism developments for community gain. In \nterms of academic disciplines, the approach is largely interdisciplinary; most scholars \ncontributing to this special issue work in geography, economics, ecology, and leisure \nand tourism studies.  The emphasis is on showing how the concept of IRT has \ndeveloped at different rates and in different forms in the study areas, and explaining \nthese spatial variations.  \n \nConclusions \nThis paper has set the scene for those that follow in this issue of Tourism \nGeographies.  It has explained the conceptual and methodological frameworks shared \nduring the research and which are used in the papers.  Additionally we have shown \nhow it is possible to create a coherent and broad definition of \u2018integration\u2019 in the \ncontext of modern rural tourism that overcomes the partial approaches to the topic \nwhich have excessively privileged one group of actors, without succumbing to \nexcessively dualistic models with 'winners' and 'losers'.  The approach used here \n 32\nallows a more complex and nuanced set of outcomes, varying spatially in tune with \nlocal circumstances.  \n \nRural communities are affected in distinctive ways by the paradigm of competition \nthat dominates traditional economic development policy.  This is particularly true for \nthe communities in lagging rural regions that lack the critical mass of people or \ninfrastructure to compete for industry and business.  Thus the guiding philosophy of \nIRT recognises that local actors are an important and significant part of a region (both \nin terms of culture, geography and population) and can benefit from policies that \nempower them and enhance their long-term well-being.  A consequence of this is that \nendogenous development (in this case for rural tourism) is highly contextual, as the \npapers that follow demonstrate.  \n \nThere is clearly a need for further research on actors\u2019 perceptions and experiences to \nunderstand how IRT can be managed within a sustainable framework. Future studies \nmight explore the basis upon which rural networks of exchange are structured and \nstakeholders prioritised in a manner that accords them various levels of salience. \nFurther research could be done to understand better the basis for various actors\u2019 \npotential to both compete and cooperate. Also valuable would be an exploration of the \nrole of local leaders\u2019 social capital in managing relationships, especially in terms of \nminimising negative behaviour among members and enhancing cooperation. Further \nresearch could also test the hypothesis that the most central and most connected actor \nin the network is able to influence its structure or its potential to grow or conversely \nremain static.  \n 33\n \nEndnote 1 \n \nThis paper is based on a collaborative programme of research funded under the EU's \nQuality of Life and Management of Living Resources programme (QLK5-CT-2000-\n01211 - SPRITE) and undertaken by the universities and research centres listed in \nEndnote 2.
