This work has shown that HPDL radiation can be used to alter the \nwetting characteristics of carbon steel so as to facilitate improved enamelling.  \nKeywords: laser; steel; enamel; wettability; surface  \n 1 INTRODUCTION \nBoth scientists and engineers alike have a great interest in understanding the interfacial phenomena \nbetween vitreous enamels and carbon steels, since in many practical applications where vitreous \nenamels are fired onto carbon steels, the performance of the article is directly linked to the nature of \nthe enamel-steel interface. Many studies to investigate these phenomena have been carried out, \nhowever, they have been principally concerned with the wettability of zirconia and other oxide \nceramics on metals \n1-5 as well as the adhesion of silicone sealants to aluminium \n6\n and the coating of \naluminium alloys with ceramic materials \n7, 8\n. The interfacial mechanisms investigated have centred \nprincipally around the thermodynamic criterion \n2, 3, 5\n, the electronic theory \n4\n and the occurrence of \noxidation \n1, 9\n. \nTo date, very little published work exists pertaining to the use of lasers for altering the surface \nproperties of materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. Notwithstanding this, it is \nrecognised within the currently published work that laser irradiation of a metal surface can bring \nabout changes in the metal\u2019s wettability characteristics. Previously Zhou et al. \n7, 8\n carried out work             \non the laser coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on                \nthe well documented fact that generated oxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting. Further, \nHeitz et al. \n10\n, Henari et al. \n11\n and Olfert et al. \n12\n have found that excimer laser treatment of metals \nresults in improved coating adhesion. The improvements in adhesion were attributed to the fact that \nthe excimer laser treatment resulted in a smoother surface and as such enhanced the action of wetting. \nHowever, the reasons for these changes with regard to changes in the material\u2019s surface morphology, \nsurface composition and surface energy are not reported. In contrast, in a more comprehensive study \nby Lawrence et al. \n13\n, which compared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and high power diode \nlaser (HPDL) radiation on the wettability characteristics of a mild steel, it was found that changes in \nthe wettability characteristics of the steel varied depending upon the laser type. \nThis present work details the use of a novel 1.2 kW HPDL to alter the wettability characteristics of a \ncommon engineering carbon steel (EN8), and the effects thereof on the adhesion and bonding \ncharacteristics with a vitreous enamel. The intention being to facilitate the hitherto impossible task of \nenamelling carbon steel in normal atmospheric conditions without pre-treatment of the steel. Indeed, \nsuch a process has been employed by the authors to facilitate the sealing, by means of laser \nenamelling, of ceramic tile grouts \n14-17\n. \n 2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND \nWhen a drop of liquid is in contact with a solid surface, the final shape taken by the drop, and thus \nwhether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative magnitudes of the molecular forces \nthat exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and the solid (adhesive) \n18\n. The index of \nthis effect for an ideal surface is the contact angle, \u03b8, which the liquid subtends with the solid. The \nadhesion intensity of a liquid to a solid surface is known as the work of adhesion, Wad, and is related \nto the liquid surface energy, \u03b3lv, by the Young-Dupre equation: \n          ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (1) \nIt is important to consider also the influence of the substrate surface roughness on the wetting contact \nangle. Rough grooves on a surface, which may contribute to the influence of contact angles, can be \ncategorised as either radial or circular grooves. Any practical rough surface can be represented by a \ncombination of these two cases \n19\n. In fact two roughness parameters can be defined: the Wenzel type, \nDR \n20\n and the Cassie\/Baxter type, FR \n21\n In the case that wetting spreads radially, as is the likely case \nwith the AOC, then the resulting radial contact angle, \u03b8rad, is related to the theoretical contact angle, \n\u03b8th, by \n  ( )cos cos\u03b8 \u03b8rad R R th RD F F= \u2212 \u22121  (2) \nAccording to Neumann \n22\n, only if FR is equal to zero, then a model similar to that for heterogeneous \nsolid surfaces can be developed in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by \nWenzel\u2019s equation: \n  ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (3) \nwhere r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is the \ncontact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s treatment is \nonly effective at the position of wetting triple line \n19\n. Nevertheless, Eq. (3) shows clearly, the \ninfluence of surface roughness on the contact angle is to cause an increase in the contact angle. Thus, \nthe smoother the contact surface is, then the smaller the contact angle will be. \n The intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive \n23\n. The majority of \nthese forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total \nsurface energy (\u03b3) comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component). \nTherefore, the surface energy of any system may be described by \n15\n \n             \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (4) \nAs such, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface \n23\n. \n          ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (5) \nBy equating Eq. (5) with Eq. (1), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to the \nsurface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n      \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (6) \n3 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \nThe laser used in the study was a 1.2 kW HPDL (Rofin-Sinar, DL-012), emitting at 940nm. The laser \nbeam was focused directly onto the samples to a 6mm x 20mm rectangular beam with a fixed power \nof 500 W. The laser was operated in the continuous wave (CW) mode. The laser head assembly and \nfocusing optics are shown schematically in Fig. 1. The beam was traversed across the samples by \nmeans of mounting the  assembly head onto the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC table. The focused laser beam \nwas thus fired across the surface of the mild steel by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam \nusing the x- and y-axis of the CNC table at speeds of 250-2000 mm\/min, whilst O2 gas was pumped \ninto a gas box in order to assist the surface treatment process. \nThe liquids used for the wetting experiments were human blood, human blood plasma, glycerol and \n4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as well as the dispersive ( \u03b3 2\nd ) \nand polar ( \u03b3 2\np ) components, are detailed in Table 1. An additional set of wetting experiments were \n conducted to simply determine the contact angle between the enamel and the mild steel before and \nafter laser treatment. \nThe solid materials used as substrates in the wetting experiments were rectangular billets (50 x \n100mm with a thickness of 3mm) of common engineering low carbon mild steel (EN8). The contact \nsurfaces of the materials were used as-received in the experiments. The enamel used commercially \navailable enamel frit (Ferro) which, in order to form a manageable paste, was mixed with 20wt% \nwhite spirit. The composition of the enamel consisted mainly of the following; SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn \nand small quantities of Pb, Ba, MgO, Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder size was less than 25\u00b5m \nmedium size. The morphological and physical characteristics of the mild steel and the enamel were \ndetermined using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoemission \nspectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. \nThe wetting experiments were carried out in atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 200C. The \ndroplets were released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the mild steel substrate (treated and \nuntreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being approximately \n6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops \nbeing obtained every minute, with the contact angle subsequently being measured. The experimental \nresults showed that throughout the period of the tests no discernible change in the magnitude of the \ncontact angle occurred.  \n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n4.1 Enamel glaze characteristics  \nIt was observed that, prior to laser irradiation, it was not possible to fire the enamel onto the as-\nreceived surface of the mild steel. Indeed, laser interaction with the enamel when placed on the \nuntreated mild steel surface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the enamel (the formation of small \nspheres approximately the diameter of the laser beam itself). Such observations are in accord with \nthose of Bourell et al. \n24\n and Agarwala et al. \n25\n, who noted the balling phenomena during laser \nsintering work. After HPDL surface treatment of the mild steel, however, it was possible to fire the \nenamel directly onto the mild steel. The mechanism of this phenomena is based entirely on the \nwettability characteristics of the mild steel, as discussed later.  \n Fig. 2 shows the typical surface morphology of the HPDL fired enamel glaze on the mild steel. The \nglaze was typically slightly undulating, with the undulations being regular in both periodicity and \nintensity. The thickness of the glaze was regular across the surface, being typically around 450\u00b5m. \nMoreover, the glaze displayed no cracks or porosities. \n4.2 Contact angle and wettability characteristics \nAn optical micrograph of a sessile drop of enamel (200C) placed on the surface of the mild steel \nbefore (a) and after (b) HPDL irradiation with the contact angle superimposed is shown in Fig. 3. As \none can see from Fig. 3, HPDL irradiation of the mild steel surface effected a considerable reduction \nin the enamel contact angle.  \nOne explanation for this observed reduction in the enamel contact angle is that the surface obtained \nafter laser treatment was somewhat smoother than the original untreated surface. The mean surface \nroughness (Ra) value of the surface of the as-received mild steel was 1.46\u00b5m, whilst for the HPDL \ntreated mild steel surface the mean Ra value was 1.12\u00b5m. Similar laser induced surface smoothing \neffects were obtained by Nicolas et al. \n26\n and Henari et al. \n11\n, who observed that excimer laser \ntreatment of ceramics and metals could result in the generation of a smoother surface. Thus, \naccording to Eq. (2), the smoother surface will inherently result in a reduction in the contact angle. \nIndeed, this fact is borne out somewhat by Fig. 4, which shows that the surface condition of the mild \nsteel resulting from HPDL modification (with a number of different traverse speeds) greatly affected \nthe measured contact angle. \nAs one can see from Fig. 4, at relatively low traverse speeds excess energy is deposited on the surface \nof the mild steel resulting in a high level of surface melting. This in turn causes porosities and a \ngenerally rough surface profile. As the traverse speed increases, however, the energy deposited               \non the surface of the mild steel reduces. Accordingly the degree of surface melting reduces ultimately \nto the optimum degree, resulting in the minimum surface roughness, and contact angle, at around \n1500 mm\/min. Beyond this point the surface roughness, and contact angle, can be seen to increase, \nindicating that insufficient melting, and consequently smoothing, was achieved.  \nSuch results are in accord with those obtained by Feng et al. \n27\n, who noted that under certain surface \nconditions, contact angle reduction was inversely proportional to surface roughness. Moreover, Olfert \net al. \n12\n found that excimer laser treatment of steel surfaces greatly improved the adhesion of a zinc \n coating. They asserted that laser treatment occasioned the smoothing of many of the high frequency \nsurface features, resulting in more complete wetting by the zinc. \nIn addition, the improvement in the wetting action experienced by the mild steel can be ascribed in \nsome part to the increase in the surface O2 content of the mild steel following HPDL treatment; since \nthis is known to increase the likelihood of wetting \n1, 9\n. Indeed, since wetting is governed by the first \natomic layers of the surface of a material, the O2 content at the surface of the mild steel before and \nafter HPDL treatment was determined using XPS. The surface oxygen content was found to have \nincreased after HPDL treatment from 34atomic% to 40atomic%. Clearly, oxidisation of the HPDL \ntreated surface of the mild steel has occurred, thus indicating that O2 enrichment of the laser treated \nmild steel surface was active in promoting wetting and adhesion \n1, 9\n. \n4.3 Mild steel surface energy and its dispersive\/polar characteristics \nIt is possible to estimate the dispersive component of the mild steel\u2019s surface energy, \u03b3 sv\nd\n, by             \nusing Eq. (6), and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv (Fig. 5). Thus the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is \nestimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the \nintercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the \nabscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1 28. The value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n for the untreated and HPDL treated (1500 mm\/min traverse \nspeed) mild steel is shown in Table 2. From the best-fit plots of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv, it was found \nthat the ordinate intercept point of the untreated mild steel-liquid system was closer to cos \u03b8 = -1 than \nthat of the HPDL treated mild steel-liquid system. This indicates that, in principle, dispersion forces \nare acting mainly at the mild steel-liquid interface, resulting in poor adhesion \n28, 29\n. In contrast, the \nbest-fit straight line for the HPDL treated mild steel-liquid system intercepted the ordinate \nconsiderably higher above the origin. This is indicative of the action of polar forces across the \ninterface, in addition to dispersion forces, hence improved wettability and adhesion is promoted \n28, 29\n. \nIt is not possible to determine the value of the polar component of the mild steel\u2019s surface energy, \n\u03b3 sv\np\n, directly from plots of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv.  This is because the intercept of the straight line \n(cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at ( )2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3sv\np\nlv\np\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and \nnot the control liquid system. However, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface \nenergies due to dispersion forces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability \n performance \n28, 30\n. It is therefore possible to calculate the dispersive component of the work of \nadhesion, Wad\nd\n, using only the relevant part of Eq. (5) thus \n        ( )Wadd svd lvd= 2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\/\n (7) \nThe results revealed that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and laser \ntreated mild steel surfaces, Wad  could be correlated with Wad\nd\n by the straight line relationship \n         W aW bad ad\nd= +  (8) \nwhere a and b are constants unique to each control liquid system. Also, for the control test liquids \nused, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar components of the control test liquids \nsurface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n                                         ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n13 115\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (9) \nBy introducing Eq. (8) into Eq. (5) and rearranging, then \n         ( )W a W bad\np\nad\nd= \u2212 +1  (10) \nBy combining Eq. (10) with Eq. (5) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, then the following \ncan be derived: \n  ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (11) \nFrom a plot of the linear relationship between Wad and Wad\nd\n, a (the gradient of the relationship \nbetween Wad  and Wad\nd\n) was determined for the untreated and laser treated mild steel. Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has \nalready been determined for the untreated and laser treated mild steel from the plots of Eq. (6), it is \npossible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser treated mild steel using Eq. (11) (see Table 2).  \nAs Table 2 shows clearly, HPDL treatment of the surface of the mild steel has led to a small increase \nin the polar component of the surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. \n It is surmised that this increase may be due to HPDL induced changes in the surface microstructure of \nthe mild steel.  \nIt is important to note that because of the long range ionic interactions in the mild steel and the \ncomposite nature of the interfaces between the mild steel and the control liquids, it is highly likely \nthat the thermodynamically defined total solid surface energy, \u03b3, as defined in Eq. (4), will be higher \nthan the sum of the dispersive, \u03b3d, and the polar, \u03b3p, components of the surface energy. Although the \nincrease in (excess) surface free energy will probably be less than the increase in the total lattice \nenergy. On the other hand an absorbed liquid layer may shield the ionic fields substantially. As such, \nall the data derived from Eq. (5) - (11) should be considered as being semi-empirical. \nNotwithstanding this, as the studies by Gutowski et al.\n6\n and Agathopoulos et al. \n23\n found, it is \nreasonable to conclude from the data obtained from Eq. (5) - (11) that HPDL treatment of the mild \nsteel surface has caused a small increase in the polar component, \u03b3p, of the surface energy. \n4.4 Bonding mechanisms \nBased on the nature of the attractive forces existing across a liquid-solid interface, wetting can be \nclassified into the two broad categories of physical wetting and chemical wetting. In physical wetting \nthe attractive energy required to wet a surface is provided by the reversible physical forces (van der \nWaals). In chemical wetting adhesion is achieved as a result of reactions occurring between the \nmating surfaces, giving rise to chemical bonds \n31\n.  \nIn practice, complex combinations of various bonding mechanisms actually occur, varying according \nto the types of materials used \n31\n. For the mild steel and the enamel, the mechanisms involved in the \nbonding are principally: physical bonding (van der Waals forces), mechanical bonding, chemical \nbonding (oxide transformation and O2 bridging) and on a very small scale, electrochemical reactions \nsuch as the electrolytic (redox) effect due to the presence of ferric oxides within the mild steel \nreacting with other oxides in the enamel \n31\n. Invariably, the preponderant bonding mechanisms \nbetween mild steels and enamels are physical and mechanical bonding \n32\n. However, an EDX analysis \nconducted at the interface between the mild steel and the enamel revealed the presence of a small \ndiffusion region which contained elements unique to both the mild steel and the enamel. This is \nperhaps to be expected since enamel glazes on steels are typically bonded as a result of some of the \nbase material dissolving into the glaze \n31\n, with wetting characteristics often being achieved or \nenhanced by a reaction at the interface at an elevated temperature \n33\n. Indeed, when an oxide layer is \n present on the surface of a metal, as was the case for the HPDL treated mild steel, then typically the \nfired enamel dissolves this oxide layer. Subsequently a redox reaction has to occur at the interface to \nform more metal oxide \n33\n. In the case of the HPDL treated mild steel and the enamel, which is an \nFe\/CoO-sodium silicate glass system, then because the oxidation potential for Fe is higher than that \nfor Co, then the redox reaction forms FeO at the interface. Thus a layer of FeO continually remains at \nthe interface and acts as the compatible oxide phase that provides the chemical bonding between the \nHPDL treated mild steel and the enamel \n33\n. Additionally, intrinsic within the redox reaction formation \nof FeO is the alloying of the Fe with the reduced Co to form dendrites in the interfacial zone by \nmeans of a microgalvanic cell mechanism \n32, 33\n. Furthermore, this alloying has a negative free energy \nwhich therefore contributes to the driving force for the net redox reaction formation of FeO \n33\n.  \nAs one can see from Fig. 6, there it is not possible to discern any dendritic growth within the             \nenamel glaze in the bond region, which is characteristic of enamels fired onto substrates containing \nFe, Si and in particular Co \n32\n. However, it can be seen that enamel is held firm in the surface \nirregularities, thus ensuring sound adhesion. Again, such mechanical bonding is typical of enamel \nglazes on metals \n32\n. \n5 CONCLUSION \nHPDL surface treatment of the mild steel resulted in changes in the wettability characteristics of the \nmild steel and the enamel as Table 3 shows.  \nImprovements in the wetting action of the mild steel after HPDL treatment were identified as being \ndue to: \ni. The HPDL induced melting of the mild steel surface which brought about a reduction \nof the surface roughness, thus directly reducing the contact angle, \u03b8. \nii. The small increase in the polar component of the surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, after HPDL \ntreatment (which is thought to be due to the HPDL effected microstructural changes), \nthus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. \niii. The increase in the surface oxygen content of the mild steel resulting from HPDL \ntreatment was identified as further promoting the action of wetting. \n This work demonstrates that it is distinctly possible to alter the wetting characteristics of the selected \nmild steel using the HPDL.  \n \n REFERENCES \n1.
