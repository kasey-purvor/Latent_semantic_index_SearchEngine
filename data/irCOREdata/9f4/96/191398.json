The main conceptual advance, which fostered the progress \nin researching cell death, has been the understanding that genetically encoded \nprogrammes decide upon cell fate {Ellis, 1986 #13}. \n \nTrue unicellular organisms, however, might have hardly developed specialized death \nprogrammes that would lead to their elimination. Nonetheless, the propagation and \nevolution based on simple cell division required extinction of unfit cells and selection \nof those endowed with environmental adaptation. For that reason in initial life forms \ndeath must have been a simple consequence of environmental injury when cell demise \nresulted from the inefficiency of survival mechanisms to cope with exogenous \nstressors. As evolution progressed, either as a result of a vertical selection or as a \nconsequence of horizontal gene transmission {Goldenfeld, 2007 #21; Vetsigian, 2006 \n#22}, new survival pathways and protective mechanisms developed and therefore a \nsystem of potential multiple failures instigated the appearance of several death \npathways. As more altruistic functions have developed first in unicellular \nagglomerates (Ameisen JC Cell Death Differ. 2002 Apr;9(4):367-93.) \nand ten in multicellular organisms, death and survival programs begun to diverge \nto assist cell differentiation and accomplish tissue homeostasis. The most obvious \nexample of a primordial death mechanism would be the failure of ion homeostasis \n(i.e. sodium and calcium) when the harshest environmental conditions applied a tight \ncontrol of ion compartmentalisation between the intra- and extracellular space. These \nmechanisms of cell and tissue damage are still operative today from simple organisms \n(e.g. C. elegans) to mammalian cells. In the latter both Ca2+ and Na+ overloads are \none of the major causes of tissue damage upon, for example, stroke and myocardial \ninfarction. As tissue plasticity and remodelling became a fundamental step in \nevolution of complex organisms, biochemical programmes involving complex \ncascades leading to cell disassembly have also developed.  \n \nIt is universally acknowledged that well known death programmes like, for example, \napoptosis include biochemical cascades that are triggered by genetically controlled \nsignalling steps. Indeed, the genetic control is probably restricted to the process of \nasymmetric division, which decides the fate of each and every daughter cell. The \nactual machinery involved in cell death execution is constitutively expressed in \nvirtually all cells. This implies its conservation from selfish individual cells to \naltruistic uni- and multicellular organisms. To explain the apparent dichotomy, the \ndeath machinery as such, must have been initially conserved because of its survival \nroles.  \n \nImbalances in Ca2+ are the most trivial examples of death routines using physiological \nsignalling systems. Calcium was the first to be recognised as a ubiquitous trigger of \ncell death in the myocardium {Fleckenstein, 1974 #9}; later the detrimental role of \ndisrupted Ca2+ signalling was recognised for many tissues and cell types {Siesjo, 1989 \n#15; Orrenius, 1994 #14; Trump, 1995 #16;Choi, 1995 #17}. Importantly, \nderegulation of Ca2+ signalling is involved in many types of cell death: it triggers \nexcitotoxicity in neurones and myocytes, it initiates apoptosis in many excitable and \nnon-excitable tissues, and it of course acts as the most important activator and \nexecutor of necrotic cell death {Orrenius, 2003 #11}.  All these death subroutines use \nexisting  molecular systems, which are responsible for physiological Ca2+ signalling.  \n \nSimilarly, several members of the caspase family of protease, which are involved in \nsignallinga and execution of apoptosis, have physiological roles,which involve their \nproteolytic functions, but also signals mediated through their prodomains {Lamkanfi, \n2007 #12}. Phylogenetic analyses, and also studies of substrate specificity, indicate \nthat human caspases can be subdivided into three different groups, one of which \n(caspases 1, 4 and 5) is not involved in programmed cell death, but in inflammation. \nThis suggested that this family originated for a distinct function. This was finally \nevident with the identification of para-caspases and meta-caspases in lower \norganisms, and also by the fact that viruses learned to regulated cell death, for \nexample via CrmA a p35, first identified by Lois Miller in 1991 in baculovirus \n(Autographa californica).  For a more detailed evaluation, please see the recent \nspecial issue of CDD {Kumar, 2006 #31; Kumar, 2007 #23;Rozan, 2007 \n#24;Martinon, 2007 #25;Scott, 2007 #26;Lamkanfi, 2007 #27;Bao, 2007 \n#28;Timmer, 2007 #29;Callus, 2007 #30}. Similar considerations apply to other \nprotease families e.g. calpains, which normally bear a variety of physiological \nfunctions, but are also involved in promotion and progression of cell death.  \n \nThe duality of survival\/death signals is well exemplified by the pancreatic acinar cell, \na classical model for studies of protein synthesis and secretion. Here frequency \nencoded signals are essential to differentiate death or survival routines. Short-lasting, \nrepetitive [Ca2+]i spikes - confined to the apical granular pole - control exocytotic \nsecretion of digestive enzymes and ion channel opening regulating fluid secretion \n{Petersen, 2005 #18}. On the other hand, prolonged global [Ca2+]i elevations induced \nby, for example, bile acids or alcohol metabolites cause intracellular digestive enzyme \nDeleted:  \nactivation, vacuole formation and ultimately necrosis giving rise to the often fatal \nhuman disease acute pancreatitis in which the pancreas digests itself and its \nsurroundings {Petersen, 2006 #19}.   \n \nIt is remarkable that the same fundamental dualism in the survival\/death signals is \nalso utilised on a tissue and organism level. Indeed many cells, which are essential for \nthe homeostasis of various tissues, employ the same mechanisms to ensure survival or \ndeliver death to unfit partners. For example glial cells, which normally act as wardens \nand guardians of brain homeostasis, also ensure the removal of redundant neurones. \nBrain insults trigger reactive gliosis, which is a well conserved defence reaction; \nstronger insults however turn reactive glia into natural killers of neurones {Giaume, \n2007 #20}. By this mechanism glia saves the whole tissue at the expense of its injured \npart.       \n \n \nThe necessity of accommodating tissue differentiation patterns has also led to \ndiversification of death routines: while the most fundamental death mechanisms are \nequal in all cells some are tissue-specific. Emergence of multiple death pathways is \nalso evolutionary justified as a single and common death mechanism would have been \neasily hijacked by opportunistic parasitic organisms. It is therefore not surprising that \ndeath and life are entwined and the understanding of death mechanisms could lead to \nfundamental improvement of our knowledge of survival and protection, and therefore \non occurrence and prevention of diseases. These guiding concepts have inspired the \narticles presented in this issue of Cell Death & Differentiation.
