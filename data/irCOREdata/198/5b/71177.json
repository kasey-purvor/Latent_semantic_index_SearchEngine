At high latitude the hard electron precipitation as-\nsociated with auroral activity is a major source of ionization\nfor the D-region, one consequence being the absorption of\nradio waves. Direct measurements of the D-region electron\ndensity are not readily available, however. This paper inves-\ntigates the relationship between the electron density at alti-\ntudes between 100 and 70 km and the total radio absorption\nobserved with a riometer, with a view to using the latter to\npredict the former. Tables are given of the median electron\ndensity corresponding to 1 dB absorption at 27.6 MHz for\neach hour of the day, and it is shown that at certain heights\nthe estimates will be accurate to within a factor of 1.6 on 50%\nof the occasions. A systematic variation with time of day is\nprobably associated with a progressive hardening of the typ-\nical electron spectrum during the morning hours. There is\nalso evidence for a seasonal effect possibly due to seasonal\nvariations of the mesosphere.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere) \u2013 Radio sci-\nence (ionospheric propagation; instruments and techniques)\n1 Introduction\nIn the auroral regions the principal source of D-region ion-\nization is the flux of energetic electrons during auroral ac-\ntivity. There are, of course, contributions from other sources,\nsuch as solar electromagnetic emissions (particularly Lyman-\n\u03b1 and X-rays), and these are enhanced during solar flares.\nSolar protons cause ionization down to relatively low alti-\ntudes during solar proton events, but such events are much\nless frequent than auroral precipitation. Overall, the electron\nflux at energies from a few tens of keV to a few hundred keV\nmay be assumed to be the dominant source most of the time,\ncontributions from other ionization sources being generally\nless significant.\nDirect observations in the D-region may be made by\nrocket-borne instruments, and although these techniques are\nCorrespondence to: J. K. Hargreaves\n(J.Hargreaves@lancaster.ac.uk)\nwell established (Mechtly, 1974; Jacobsen and Friedrich,\n1979), they are expensive and the data are limited because\neach flight produces only a single profile. Since the mid\n1970s, and more particularly, since the EISCAT system be-\ngan to operate in the early 1980s, it has been possible to mea-\nsure electron densities in the D-region by incoherent scatter\nradar (Hunsucker, 1974; Ranta et al., 1985; Devlin et al.,\n1986). Under good conditions it is possible to obtain accurate\nmeasurements at 1 km height resolution and 10 s time reso-\nlution. Radar is considerably less sensitive than the rocket-\nborne probes but it may provide continuous runs of data over\nseveral hours. However, the radar data are still limited be-\ncause incoherent scatter radars are few in number and immo-\nbile, and they are also expensive to operate.\nAnother way of detecting enhancements in the D-region is\nby measuring the absorption of a radio signal that has passed\nthrough the medium. This is the purpose of the riometer tech-\nnique in which the intensity of the cosmic radio noise at some\nfrequency, usually between 20 and 60 MHz, is monitored us-\ning a stable receiver at the ground (Hargreaves, 1969). The\nriometer is relatively cheap and simple to operate. Many of\nthem have been, and still are, in use.\nThis paper addresses the question of whether riometer data\nmay realistically be used to indicate the electron density at a\nselected altitude. The depth to which an incoming electron\npenetrates into the atmosphere depends on its initial energy\n(Rees, 1963), the more energetic ones depositing their en-\nergy at lower altitudes. The resulting electron-density pro-\nfile, therefore, depends on the original spectrum of the in-\ncident particles. Then, if the electron density is Ne(h), the\nabsorption of a radio wave of angular frequency \u03c9 = 2pif is\nA (dB) = 4.6\u00d7 10\u22125\n\u222b\nNe(h)\u03bd(h)\n\u03c92 + \u03bd(h)2 dh , (1)\n(Hargreaves, 1969) where \u03bd(h) is the electron-neutral colli-\nsion frequency. While \u03bd(h) is a property of the atmosphere\n(i.e. proportional to pressure), Ne(h) depends on the incom-\ning electron flux over a band of energies and thus, also on\nthe particle energy. Since the spectrum of the ionizing elec-\ntrons is not constant, one cannot expect to find a precise rela-\n604 J. K. Hargreaves and M.

But\nneither is the spectrum entirely random. Therefore, we may\nreasonably ask to what extent, if any, ground-based absorp-\ntion measurements may be used to indicate D-region elec-\ntron density, and, if so, what will be the accuracy of these\nestimates.\n2 The present investigation and data used\nFriedrich and Kirkwood (2000) have published average\nelectron-density profiles corresponding to selected absorp-\ntion levels.

The profiles were divided according to whether\nor not the D-region was illuminated by the Sun. The present\nstudy seeks to extend those results in two directions: by spec-\nifying the likely accuracy of the estimates, and by looking at\nthe change from night to day in greater detail.\nThe electron density values are taken from EISCAT UHF\ncommon programme runs over the years 1985 to 1992, inclu-\nsive. The heights 70 to 100 km were selected at 5 km inter-\nvals. Each of the electron-density profiles was inspected to\neliminate poor data. In cases where the return was too weak\nfor a reliable electron density to be determined, the value\nzero was substituted.

Both data sets\nare at a 5-min interval. Since the riometer data are relatively\nless accurate at small values, and to reduce the effect of solar\ncontributions to the absorption (which could amount to a few\ntenths of a dB at noon), only values of at least 0.5 dB are used\nin the following analysis.\n3 Data analysis\nSince the absorption at a given height is proportional to the\nelectron density (Eq. 1), we work with the ratio Ne(h)\/A,\nwhere Ne(h) is the electron density in m\u22123 at height h and\nA is the total absorption at 27.6 MHz in dB. Figure 1a shows\nthe values of Ne(90)\/A over the whole data set against the\nyear. Its value spreads by about a factor of 10, but there is\nno indication of a systematic variation from year to year. We\nshall, therefore, take all the years together. Figure 1b shows\nthe distribution of data points with month and time of day.\nThis distribution is less even than we might wish. The gap in\nthe afternoon corresponds with the low occurrence of auroral\nabsorption at that time of day, which is well known (Harg-\nreaves and Cowley, 1967), but the gaps during the summer\nperiod, and during the winter, from Christmas to the end of\nJanuary, are plainly observational and due to the schedules\nof radar operations.\nAs an example of the results, Fig. 2 shows the values of\nNe\/A for 90 and 80 km for the autumn period (months 8.25\u2013\n11.25) against time of day, with medians and quartiles super-\nimposed. At 90 km there is a marked variation with time of\nday, particularly during the morning hours. That variation is\nnot apparent at 80 km. In that case, however, medians were\nobtained only for the hours 01:00 to 11:00 UT. At other times\nonly the upper quartiles are shown. The lower quartiles are\nlost in the zeros of the data set, and are not plotted; they fall\nbelow the limit of measurement.\nTable 1 summarizes the median values of electron den-\nsity corresponding to 1 dB absorption for each hour of the\nUT day. When no median was obtained, the upper quartile\nis marked with an asterisk. This table uses the values from\nall months. The relative lack of data in summer and winter\nmakes it more difficult to look for seasonal variations, but we\nwill return to this point in a later section.\nWhen the value zero appears in Table 1, it means that\neven the upper quartile was below the threshold of measure-\nment. We can estimate that threshold from the distribution\nof measured electron density (Fig. 3). Since each value is\n606 J. K. Hargreaves and M.

Note that at 75 km and below\nthe medians were all below the radar threshold. At 80 km\nthe values were above the threshold only between 03:00 and\n11:00 UT. Systematic trends are apparant. At 100 and 95 km\nthe ratio Ne\/A decreases steadily from the midnight sector\ninto the daytime, whereas the lower heights show an increase\nfollowed by a decrease during the morning hours. The dips\nat 20:00 UT are probably statistical.\nIn order to serve as a prediction model, the information\nin Fig. 4 needs to be supplimented by a knowledge of the\nspread of the values contributing to each median. Table 3\nshows the relationship between quartiles and median at the\nvarious heights. At 90 km and above, the ratios (upper quar-\n608 J. K. Hargreaves and M. Friedrich: The estimation of D-region electron densities from riometer data\n(a)\nSolar zenith angle\n(b)\nSolar zenith angle\nFig. 6. Ne\/A against the solar zenith angle.\ntile)\/median and median\/(lower quartile) are both about 1.5\nor 1.6. This means that there is a 50% chance that a single\nestimate will be within 1.6 of the true value. The spread is\nsomewhat worse at the lower heights.\n5 Significance of the diurnal variation\nThe electron-density profile may be inverted to give an indi-\ncation of the spectrum of incoming particles that produced\nit (Hargreaves and Devlin, 1990). Some assumptions have\nto be made about the atmospheric composition and about the\neffective recombination coefficient as a function of altitude.\nAlthough the absolute values may be questioned, this ap-\nproach is useful for interpreting changes of profile in terms\nof a changing spectrum. Treating in this way the median\nprofiles for 23:00\u201324:00 UT and each 3 h to 11:00\u201312:00 UT\n(Fig. 5) shows a hardening of the typical spectrum with time.\nThe earliest spectrum is almost exponential with characteris-\ntic energy 6.5 keV, a value consistent with other determina-\ntions for that time of day (Devlin et al., 1986). Later in the\nmorning, the characteristic energy is considerably greater,\nabout 16 keV. This hardening is also consistent with previ-\nous observations of individual events (Hargreaves and De-\nvlin, 1990).\n6 The question of photodetachment\nIn polar-cap absorption events (PCA), which result from the\nincidence of solar protons, the level of absorption changes\ndrastically between day and night, according to whether or\nnot the ionosphere is sunlit (Bailey, 1957). Such a transition\nis expected because the effective electron recombination in\nthe lower ionosphere increases drastically in the absence of\ndaylight, due to attachment of electrons to neutrals and the\nenhanced formation of cluster ions. PCA occurs lower in\nthe atmosphere than auroral absorption (AA), and attempts\nto identify the same effect in AA (most notably the analysis\nby Armstrong et al., 1977) have failed to find one.\nIn Fig. 6 we show the quantity Ne\/A against the solar\nzenith angle (\u03c7 ), for two altitudes. It will be noted that there\nis no sharp change between \u03c7 = 90 and 100\u25e6, as would be\nthe case in PCA. We note, further, that the absorption pro-\nfiles (Fig. 7) corresponding to the spectra of Fig. 5 peak be-\ntween 90 and 95 km; the contribution at and below 75 km is\nlikely to be small. Incoherent-scatter radar studies of PCA,\nhowever, show that most of the day\/night variation of elec-\ntron density in those events is strongly height dependent, and\nis rather small above 75 km (Reagan and Watt, 1976; Col-\nlis and Rietveld, 1990; Hargreaves et al., 1993). For large\nionisation rates, such as those considered in the present con-\ntext (absorption larger than 0.5 dB), the cluster ledge is most\nlikely to be always below 80 km. We conclude that the diur-\nnal variation shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 is a consequence of\na changing electron spectrum, not of solar illumination.\n7 Seasonal variation\nThe scheme described above takes into account daily but not\nseasonal variations. To include both variables requires the\ndata to be sorted into 288 boxes to cover each hour of each\nmonth, and since the distribution is uneven some of these\nboxes will contain too few data points for a significant result.\nTherefore, median values of the ratio Ne\/A were derived\nonly for those boxes containing at least 30 points. These\nvalues are given in Tables A1\u20135, covering heights 100 to\n80 km, in the Appendix. As before, zero means that the me-\ndian value was below the threshold of observation. Based\non the general statistics (Sect. 3), it is estimated that about\nhalf the medians in the tables will not be within 10% of the\ntrue value. In comparing values, therefore, differences less\nJ.

Partial absorption profiles\ncorresponding to the median electron-\ndensity profiles in the night-to-morning\nsector.\nthan 10% should not be considered significant. Differences\nof more than 50% are likely to be significant.\nThe best coverage across all months is between 04:00 and\n07:00 UT. We can also compare the variations during the day\nby taking together November to March (as winter) and July\nto August (as summer), though both these groups lack data\nfrom 14:00 to 20:00 UT. The reader may like to draw his or\nher own conclusions, but the authors offer the following com-\nments:\n1. At 100 and 95 km, the value of electron density corre-\nsponding to 1 dB absorption is relatively high in sum-\nmer around 00:00 UT, but relatively low for several\nhours before that.\n2. At 90 km, the summer maximum at 00:00 UT has van-\nished, though values are still low before that time.\n3. At 85 km, the low values before 00:00 UT are now be-\nlow the threshold. There is now also a dip during the\nearly morning (05:00 to 07:00 UT).\n4. At 80 km, all summer values are low relative to those at\nother times of the year.\nFor a given spectrum of incoming energetic electrons, the\nionization rate and the effective recombination coefficient,\nand, therefore, the ionization profile, are all influenced by\nthe vertical profiles of density and pressure in the meso-\nsphere. Further, the resulting radio absorption depends on the\nelectron-neutral collision frequency, which is also pressure\ndependent. Direct measurements of atmospheric density at\nhigh latitude show a reduction in summer at 100 and 95 km,\nand a summer increase at 85 and 80 km. The seasonal vari-\nations indicated by Tables A1\u20135 may well be a consequence\nof mesospheric changes, but due to the inherent limitations\nof the data they should be regarded as indications rather than\ndefinitive determinations.\n8 Conclusions and discussion\n1. An analysis of incoherent-scatter and riometer data over\na period of 8 years, including more than 4000 individ-\nual measurements, shows that an observation of auroral\nradio absorption may be interpreted to estimate the ap-\nproximate electron density at heights between 100 and\n80 km. The results presented apply only if the absorp-\ntion is at least 0.5 dB. The results are given in terms\nof the medians, and upper and lower quartiles of the\nelectron density, corresponding to 1 dB absorption mea-\nsured with a 27.6 MHz riometer pointed vertically.\n2. The uncertainty of the procedure is such that at the\ngreater heights (100, 95 and 90 km) the estimate will\nbe accurate to within a factor of 1.6 on 50% of the oc-\ncasions. At lower heights the error appears to be rather\nworse.\n3. The sensitivity of the EISCAT UHF radar when using 5-\nmin averaging is found to be 1010 m\u22123, or a little below,\nin the D-region. Due to this limit no median values of\nthe electron density corresponding to 1 dB absorption\ncould be determined at or below 75 km, and the 80-km\nvalues are restricted to one period of the day. The upper\n610 J. K. Hargreaves and M. Friedrich: The estimation of D-region electron densities from riometer data\nquartile could be specified at 80 and 75 km, but not at\n70 km.\n4. Since the typical spectrum of incoming energetic elec-\ntrons varies with the time of day, the estimates of elec-\ntron density show a diurnal variation. There is no evi-\ndence that solar illumination has any effect at 80 km or\nabove.\n5. Dividing the data according to both time-of-day and\nseason suggests that a seasonal effect is also present,\nbut due to data limitations the actual values should be\ntreated with caution.\nThe absorption values used in this investigation are those\nactually measured by a simple riometer system using a ver-\ntical 5-element Yagi antenna. It is estimated that such an\nantenna records absorption about 20% greater than would be\nmeasured by an ideal system having a zenithal pencil beam.\nThis factor should be taken into account where appropriate.\nAcknowledgements.
