Erosional landforms are angular to subangular with \nabundant plucked lee faces, suggesting a high proportion of plucking over abrasion.

Thus glacial conditions (ice velocity, ice thickness) can only be inferred from glacial \nerosional landforms if the effects of bedrock properties of the substrate are considered.  \n \nKeywords:   glacial erosion; bedrock; abrasion; plucking; whaleback\n 1\n \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nAbrasion and plucking are generally regarded as the dominant erosion mechanisms at the \nbase of glaciers and ice sheets (e.g., Glasser and Bennett, 2004).  Glacial abrasion is the surface \nwear achieved by individual clasts contained within ice or by subglacial sediment sliding over \nbedrock (Cuffey and Alley, 1996; Hindmarsh, 1996a, b, 1999). Abrasion can involve polishing by silt-\nsize (< 0.01 m) material; scratching, producing grooves, and striae; and the removal of small rock \nfragments by larger clasts (Hallet, 1979; Iverson, 1991a; Hindmarsh, 1996a).  On the grain scale, \nabrasion can crush individual grains, it can remove grains from adjacent ones, or it can remove \nmultigrain fragments. In contrast, plucking (or quarrying) involves the removal of large fragments; it \ndoes not require basal debris but, instead, produces it.  The two erosion processes each produce \ndistinct landforms that, after deglaciation, can be easily recognised in the field.  Glacial striae, \nsmoothed bedforms such as whalebacks, and elongate p-forms are formed by abrasion; whilst \nquarried or plucked lee-side faces are formed by plucking  (e.g., Glasser and Warren, 1990; Sugden \net al., 1992; Benn and Evans, 1998; Glasser et al., 1998).   \nThe controls on the relative importance of abrasion vs. plucking are, however, less clear \n(e.g., Briner and Swanson, 1998).  Some authors have highlighted the importance of glacial controls \nsuch as ice thickness, ice velocity, and water pressure.  Plucking requires that a cavity opens \nbetween the glacier and its bed (bed separation), normally in the lee-side of an obstruction.  Glacial \nconditions that are regarded to favour such cavity formation (and hence plucking) are thought to \ninclude thin, fast moving (sliding) ice or ice that is subjected to high and fluctuating water pressure.  \nConversely, glacial conditions such as thick, slow moving, or highly plastic ice are seen to suppress \ncavity formation and hence plucking, and therefore favour (e.g., Sharp et al., 1989; Glasser and \nWarren, 1990; Iverson, 1991b; Evans, 1996; Hallet, 1996; Glasser and Bennett, 2004).  \nConsequently, in deglaciated areas, landform analysis has been used to infer local palaeoglacial \nconditions such as ice thickness and velocity (Sharp et al., 1989; Evans, 1996; Glasser and Bennett, \n2004; Roberts and Long, 2005).  \n In contrast, other studies have shown a relationship between bedrock lithology and \nsubglacial erosion mechanisms (Glasser et al., 1998; Phillips et al., 2010).  Subglacial experiments \nhave shown a clear relationship between rock hardness and subglacial abrasion rates (Boulton, \n1979). Equally, numerous studies suggest a strong link between the presence of preexisting \nmechanical discontinuities (bedding and joints) and plucking (e.g., Gordon, 1981; Rastas and \nSepp\u00e4l\u00e4, 1981; Rea, 1994; Glasser et al., 1998). D\u00fchnforth et al., (2010) showed that within one rock \ntype (granodiorite) that underwent valley glaciation in Yosemite, areas of close joint spacing \nexperienced faster, deeper glacial erosion than areas of wide joint spacing; and they attributed this to \nenhanced plucking in areas of close joint spacing.  Hardness and joint density are therefore \nexpected to provide strong controls on the mode of erosion (i.e., abrasion vs. plucking). Some \nstudies have also shown that the final products of glacial erosion of bedrock surfaces vary with the \ndegree of preglacial weathering (Lindstr\u00f6m, 1988; Olvmo et al., 1999; Johansson et al., 2001a, b; \n 2\nKrabbendam & Glasser: Glacial erosion: Abrasion vs Plucking.  MS for Geomorphology \nOlvmo and Johansson, 2002); in effect this means that the bedrock properties in the top few metres \ncan be different than the bulk bedrock below.   \n \nThe relative importance of abrasion and plucking are thus dependent on very different factors.  To \nbetter understand the effect of different controls on subglacial erosion mechanisms requires an area \nwhere the role of lithology can be isolated. Glasser et al. (1998) studied the detail of small-scale \nlandforms on different bedrock (psammite, schist, marble), formed under uniform glacial conditions.  \nSharp et al. (1989) studied a single bedrock landform (composed of ignimbrite) that showed different \nglacial conditions during different glaciations.  However, these and similar studies did not provide \nquantitative analyses of bedrock properties so that the precise role played by bedrock properties \nremains elusive.   \nIn this paper we test the hypothesis that, under uniform glacial conditions, bedrock \nproperties exert a strong control on the shape of erosional landforms and, by implication, the \nsubglacial erosion mechanisms that created the landforms.  We analyse both the bedrock properties \nand the landforms in a quantitative or semiquantitative manner and suggest a relatively fast \n\u2018reconnaissance type\u2019 method to achieve this.  \n \n2. Study area \n \nThe study area is located just north of the village of Ullapool on the NW coast of Scotland (Figs. 1, \n2).  The area contains two contrasting bedrock types, sandstone and quartzite, with their boundary at \nhigh angles to palaeo-ice flow at the base of a palaeo-ice stream.  Because the palaeo-ice stream \nflowed across two lithologies in close proximity, we can be confident that palaeoglacial conditions on \neither side of the lithological boundary were identical.  \n \n2.1. Palaeoglacial setting \n \nNorthern Scotland was repeatedly glaciated by Pleistocene ice sheets, with the Last Glacial \nMaximum (LGM) culminating between c. 30 and 20 ka (Late Devensian; e.g., Bradwell et al., 2008a; \nHubbard et al., 2009; Scourse et al., 2009). The study area was deglaciated at c. 14-13 ka (Bradwell \net al., 2008b; Stoker et al., 2009).  The study area occurs in the centre of a palaeo-ice stream (Fig. 1) \nthat joined with other ice streams to become the larger Minch palaeo-ice stream offshore (Stoker and \nBradwell, 2005; Bradwell et al., 2008c).  Ice flow within the ice stream was topographically \nconstrained between two mountain massifs to the north and south (900-100 m above sea level), \nresulting in westward ice flow across the study area. Warm-based westward ice flow is corroborated \nby glacial striae across the study area (Fig. 2), the occurrence of a field of E-W oriented bedrock \nmegagrooves just east of the study area, and streamlined landforms offshore to the west (Bradwell \net al., 2008c; Stoker et al., 2009).  Ice thickness was at least 700 m (Stone et al., 1998; Ballantyne et \nal., 1998) but possibly greater (Bradwell and Krabbendam, 2003; Mathers et al., 2010).   \n \n2.2. Bedrock geology setting \n 3\n \n \n \nCambrian quartzite occurs in the east (up-ice) and Torridon sandstone in the west (down-ice) \n(Krabbendam and Bradwell, 2010).  The Torridon sandstone strata dip c. 10\u00b0 to the east (Figs. 2, 3).  \nA low angle unconformity, which dips 12-15 \u00b0 to the east, forms a sharp boundary between the \nsandstone below and the overlying quartzite. The quartzite occurs at slightly higher ground (200-250 \nm) than the Torridon sandstone (from sea level to c. 200 m).  The c. 1000-Ma-old Torridon \nsandstone is a very thick and remarkably uniform sequence of coarse, red, thick-bedded sandstone \nwith subsidiary layers of pebble conglomerate and locally thin layers of siltstone.  The sandstone is \narkosic, comprising quartz and feldspar grains in a matrix of clay and hematite (e.g., Stewart, 2002).   \nThe Cambrian quartzite comprises two members: the Basal Quartzite member and the Pipe Rock \nmember, each 80-120 m thick.  In this study, only Basal Quartzite was analysed, but the results are \nalso expected to be valid for the Pipe Rock member, which is more widespread elsewhere in the \narea. In the study area, beds dips 12-18 \u00b0 to the E or ESE (i.e. up-ice).  The quartzite comprises \nmainly quartz, with 5-10% feldspar grains, and with the basal part more feldspathic that higher units.   \nThe grains are tightly packed, with very little matrix (McKie, 1990; Prigmore and Rushton, 1999; \nBritish Geological Survey, 2008).   \n \n3. Bedrock properties and subglacial erosion mechanisms \n \nAn important issue is which bedrock property is relevant to which erosion mechanism (Augustinus, \n1991).   In contrast to hill slope processes, glacial valley widening and fluvial erosional processes \n(e.g., Selby, 1982; Augustinus, 1992; Sklar and Dietrich, 2001; Brook et al., 2004; Moore et al., \n2009), the relevant rock properties for subglacial erosion are not well known (e.g., Haynes, 1968; \nGordon, 1981).  \nFor abrasion, relevant bedrock properties would be rock hardness of the bed (Boulton, \n1979); relative rock hardness between basal debris particles and the bed (Hallet, 1979; Iverson, \n1991a) and, when abrasion involves removal of multigrain fragments, fracture toughness or tensile \nstrength of the bed (Iverson, 1991a).  Sklar and Dietrich (2001) showed experimentally that (fluvial) \nabrasion resistance is dependent on absolute hardness of the bed, as well as relative clast-to-bed \nhardness.  They showed a good correlation between fluvial abrasion resistance and tensile strength \nfor a wide range of rock types.  In this study, Schmidt hammer rebound values were used as a \nsemiquantitative proxy for abrasion resistance.  Over a range of rock types, Schmidt hammer \nrebound values correlate well with tensile strength, uniaxial compressive strength, and abrasion \nhardness (Deere and Miller, 1966; Augustinus, 1991; Aydin and Basu, 2005).  The Schmidt hammer \ntest is an efficient, nondestructive method that can be performed quickly in the field on a large \nnumber of sample sites.  \nConcerning plucking, unjointed bedrock may possibly fracture subglacially if differential \nstresses on a rock step are very high (e.g., Hallet, 1996), but these seem to be exceptional \ncircumstances.  Joints represent such significant mechanical weaknesses compared to unfractured \nrock that the occurrence of joints effectively controls whether or not plucking occurs (Mathes, 1930; \nRea and Whalley, 1996). This is borne out by a number of field studies describing links between \n 4\nKrabbendam & Glasser: Glacial erosion: Abrasion vs Plucking.  MS for Geomorphology \njoints and plucking (e.g., Mathes, 1930; Rastas and Sepp\u00e4ll\u00e4, 1981, Gordon, 1981, Sugden et al., \n1992; Rea, 1994; D\u00fchnforth et al., 2010).  We note here that joints are amongst the most common \ngeological structures on Earth.  They are ubiquitous in well-stratified rocks in nonglaciated and \nglaciated regions alike and they are predominantly caused by non-glacial processes such as tectonic \nstresses, sedimentary loading, erosive unloading, and cooling (e.g., Jahns, 1943; Davis and \nReynolds, 1996; Rogers and Engelder, 2004; Peacock, 2004).  Consequently, we assume that the \njoints in the study areas are pre-glacial (e.g., Laubach and Diaz-Tushman, 2009).   \n \n4. Methods \n \n4.1. Landform analysis \n\u2018Roche moutonn\u00e9e\u2019 and \u2018whaleback\u2019 are only two terms for a range of possible bedrock landforms \nproduced by subglacial erosion. Here, we attempt a quantitative analysis of subglacially eroded \nbedrock landforms.  The along-ice profile of landforms (parallel to palaeo-ice flow) was traced from \ndigital photos taken at right angles to ice flow.  Three parameters, all normalised, can be derived \nfrom these profiles (Fig. 4): \n(i) The curvature of the landform, normalised against its thickness.  This is here taken as r\/h, where \nh is the height of the landform measured normal to bedding, and r is the radius of the largest circle \nthat fits the sharpest curvature of the profile (Fig. 4A).  \nFor the following two parameters, we assume that plucking creates an approximately rectangular \nprofile on the lee side (this is justified as joints and bedding make approximately right angles, and all \nplucked faces are at approximately right angles to bedding); whilst abrasion will tend to modify this \nangular profile to a smoother profile, possibly approaching a segment of an ellipsoid. \n(ii) Deviation from a rectangular profile in terms of area (Fig. 4B).  A1 is the area of the hypothetical \nrectangle defined along the bedding planes, constrained by the tangent on the top of the rectangle \nand its front;  Aer is that part of the rectangle that has been eroded.  Aer \/A1 thus provides a measure \nof the amount of modification by abrasion of the original rectangular profile; \n(iii) The deviation of the rectangle in terms of changes of the profile length (Fig. 4C). This method is \nsimilar to the \u2018tape measure\u2019 method used by Kirkbride (2005) and Kirkbride and Bell (2010) to \nquantify edge rounding by weathering.  Kirkbride (2005) assumed that edge rounding by weathering \nresults in symmetric curvature and ideally approaches a segment of a circle.  This is not appropriate \nin this situation, as abrasion will result in an asymmetric profile.  Instead, we assume that abrasion \nwill work toward an ellipsoidal profile.  We here define the change in length \uf044L as (L1 - L2)\/(L1 - \nLellipse), where L1 = a + b, the sides of the rectangle, L2 is the length of the real profile as seen in the \nlandforms, and Lellipse is one-quarter the circumference of an ellipse defined by the axes a and b.  \nThus, if the landform profile approaches a rectangle, \uf044L is close to zero; if it approaches an ellipsoid, \n\uf044L will move toward 1.  \nWe note that the landforms have been subjected to post-glacial weathering, which may lead \nto minor modification of the profile since deglaciation: this aspect will be discussed in section 5.1.  \nThe quantitative comparison of landforms was applied to outcrops on Beinn Giubhais within the \n 5\n \n \naltitude range of 180 \u2013 220 m (Fig. 2).  Individual landforms were numbered to allow cross-\nreferencing between the tables and the profiles. All grid references are British National Grid (BNG).  \n \n4.2. Bedrock properties: hardness and joint spacing \nSchmidt hammer measurements were taken on fresh, striated, bedrock surfaces.  All measurements \nwere taken more than 20 cm away from joints and more than 1 m away from edges to minimise any \nedge effects (e.g., Viles et al., 2011). As the presence of lichen significantly lowers the Schmidt \nhammer values, all surfaces were polished prior to measurement to remove lichen. \nFor our joint spacing analysis, we first measured joint spacing and orientation on a \n(subhorizontal) bedding plane to establish the orientation of the dominant joint sets, using a \ngeological compass (\u2018area method\u2019; see for instance Davis and Reynolds, 1996).  Joint spacing was \nsubsequently measured along transects of 10 m or longer of continuous cliff exposures at \napproximate right angles to the dominant joint sets (\u2018line method\u2019; Davis and Reynolds, 1996).   Only \nopen joints were measured: although cemented joints (veins) were noted, these rarely appeared to \nbe continuous or to represent mechanical weaknesses.  Bedding thickness was measured on \nsubvertical exposures with a height range of 3-100 m.  The definition of a bedding plane as a \nmechanical discontinuity is somewhat subjective.  Here, we measured only those bedding planes \nthat either coincide with a joint (bedding plane joints) or contain a significant concentration of mica or \nclay minerals, and hence represent a clear mechanical weakness.   \n \n \n5. Results \n \n5.1. Weathering of bedrock \nPost-glacial weathering of bedrock potentially affects both bedrock properties and landforms, and the \ndegree of weathering needs to be considered when interpreting the results of our analyses. \nSubaerial weathering of quartzite proceeds exceedingly slowly, because its dominant minerals and \nits silica cement are chemically stable under mid-latitude atmospheric conditions.  This is \ncorroborated by the excellent preservation of glacial striae on this lithology throughout the region \n(e.g., Lawson, 1996).  The absence or rarity of scree or loose blocks below the lee-side rock steps \nindicates that modification of the quartzite landforms by periglacial frost weathering and post-glacial \nslope processes has been absent or negligible (Fig. 5). Note that, larger quartzite cliffs (> 20 m high) \nthroughout the region are characterised by more intense slope processes, commonly fed by \nblockfields on summit areas (e.g., Ballantyne, 1995).  \nIn contrast, the Torridon sandstone is more susceptible to subaerial weathering, mainly \nbecause its matrix is rich in clay and hematite. The hardness of Torridon sandstone is reduced \nsignificantly by subaerial weathering, especially at elevations > 500 m (McCarroll et al., 1995).  \nOutcrops of Torridon sandstone generally have a \u2018creased\u2019 appearance as a result of enhanced \nweathering along joints and bedding planes (Fig. 6; see also Bradwell and Krabbendam, 2003; \nMcCarroll et al., 1995).  In a few localities (Fig. 6A), the original striated surface can be found \nadjacent to a more weathered surface.  This shows that post-glacial processes have removed \n 6\nKrabbendam & Glasser: Glacial erosion: Abrasion vs Plucking.  MS for Geomorphology \nbetween 5 and 10 cm of material, with deepest weathering occurring along joints. This is consistent \nwith the joint depth measurements between 1.5 and 10 cm of McCarroll et al. (1995).  Kirkbride and \nBell (2010) measured edge roundness radii between 4  and 8 cm of Torridon sandstone boulders for \nmoraines and rockfalls of Younger Dryas and late Devensian (\u2018Wester Ross Readvance\u2019; c. 13 ka) \nage.  In one locality in our study area, a plucked face of a roche moutonn\u00e9e occurs adjacent to a \nwhaleback (Fig. 6B, background).  This shows that post-glacial weathering has not significantly \naffected the overall shape of the landform. Overall, post-glacial surface weathering of Torridon \nsandstone surfaces has probably not exceeded ~ 10 cm.  The Torridon sandstone landforms are \ntypically > 1 m in height, so that weathering introduces an \u2018error\u2019 of < 10% to the morphometric \nanalyses.   \n \n5.2. Glacial erosional landforms \nGlacial erosional landforms on Cambrian quartzite are angular to subangular. Outcrops typically \nconsist of a gentle east-dipping stoss side developed approximately along a bedding plane and a \nsteep, west-dipping subvertical lee-side developed along joint planes (Figs. 5, 7).  Outcrops thus \nform \u2018roches moutonn\u00e9es\u2019 commonly approaching ideal rectangular prisms, with fairly sharp crests \n(Figs. 5A, B).  Individual prisms are 5-10 m long and 1-3 m high, but \u2018nested\u2019 prisms can occur and \nform c. 10-15 m high stepped rock faces (Fig. 5B). The stoss sides are typically striated; locally, \ncrescentic fractures occur on the stoss side close (< 1 m) to the crests.  P-forms are very rare. \nStriated surfaces are common, but probably involved minimal erosion:  cross-cutting striae are \nrelatively widespread in the region (see Lawson, 1996) and show that the last striation event did not \nabrade sufficient material to remove the evidence of the first one (see also Sharp et al., 1989). \nFarther north in Assynt, where the Pipe Rock member is more widespread (Peach et al., 1907; \nBritish Geological Survey, 2007), Skolithos pipe-shaped trace fossils still form \u2018dimples\u2019 on striated \nsurfaces, constraining abrasion to a few millimetres.  Subaerial surface weathering of quartzite \nproceeds exceedingly slowly, and the preservation potential of striae is much higher than that of any \nother rocks in the region (e.g., Lawson, 1996). The abundance of striae, therefore, provides no \nindication of intensity of abrasion; rather, it indicates a lack of post-glacial weathering.  \nOverall, outcrops of Cambrian quartzite are dominated by landforms associated with glacial \nplucking, whilst (micro)landforms related to glacial abrasion involved only a minor amount of erosion.   \n \nGlacial erosional landforms on Torridon sandstone are typically subrounded roches moutonn\u00e9es, \ntransitional to whalebacks.  On Beinn Giubhais, the landforms are typically 7-30 m long and 2-5 m \nhigh (Figs. 6B, C).  On Meall nan Clachan (Fig. 2, top), however, some very elongate whalebacks \nare up to 100 m long and 2-5 m high (Fig. 6D). Edges of roches moutonn\u00e9es are smoothly curved \n(Figs. 6, 7), even taking into account c. 5-10 cm of post-glacial weathering (see above). Numerous \nroches moutonn\u00e9es also show a dip, or a shallow concave curve, on the stoss side (Fig. 7), a feature \nnot observed on quartzite landforms. Elongate p-forms, parallel to palaeo-ice flow, are very common \n(Fig. 6C). Very well preserved, highly elongate p-forms occur just above sea level near Keanchulish, \nassociated with striae up to 2 m long (Bradwell, 2010).  Surfaces little affected by post-glacial \n 7\n \n \nweathering (recently exhumed from beneath till or peat in, for instance, road cuttings) are \nubiquitously smooth and rounded and show abundant deep striae.  \nThere is evidence of lee-side plucking (Fig. 6B, background), but most roches moutonn\u00e9es \nare highly elongate, and the longitudinal (down-ice) spacing of plucked faces is high (> 50-200 m) \n(see also Bradwell et al., 2008c, their Fig. 7). Apparently, plucking only occurred along widely spaced \n\u2018master\u2019 joints.  Torridon sandstone occurs down-ice from Cambrian quartzite (Fig. 2), and small \n(< 0.1 m) erratics of Cambrian quartzite are abundant on outcrops of Torridon sandstone. Therefore, \nthe sandstone has been abraded by basal debris that was substantially harder than itself, making \nabrasion very efficient (e.g., Boulton, 1979). Overall, glacial erosional landforms on Torridon \nsandstone are dominated by abrasion, with plucking evident only on widely spaced master joints.  \n \n5.3. Quantitative landform analysis  \nThe results of the quantitative landform analysis are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 8. The average \nnormalised radius (r\/h) of quartzite landforms is 0.145, whilst that of sandstone whalebacks is 0.41.  \nSandstone landforms are thus more smoothly curved than quartzite landforms.  The change in profile \narea (Aer\/A1) and the change in profile length (\uf044L) are both consistently larger for sandstone \nlandforms than for quartzite landforms.  The frontal parts of some sandstone whalebacks approach \nan ideal ellipse, for example landform T124 (Fig. 8).  The values for Torridon sandstone landforms \nare more variable and show a wider standard deviation for the normalised radius and the change in \nprofile area (Table 1).  This reflects a higher variability in landform profile, as seen in Fig. 7. \nLandforms T116F and T116B diverge strongly from the ideal ellipse and have a complex shape with \nsmall normalised radii, presumably as they were formed by a mix of plucking and abrasion.  Overall, \nsandstone landforms are smoother and more ellipsoid in profile than quartzite landforms, which are \nmore angular.  \n \n5.4. Bedrock properties \nResults of the bedrock property analyses are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 9. The Cambrian \nquartzite is the harder rock (Schmidt hammer R-values of ~ 60). The median bed thickness is 0.16 m \nand joint spacing is 0.29 m. The average rectangular \u2018block\u2019 delineated by two bedding planes and \nfour joint surfaces is ~ 0.013 m3.  The Torridon sandstone is the softer rock (Schmidt hammer R-\nvalues of ~ 45). The median bed thickness is 1.4 m, joint spacing 2.6 m, and the average block \nvolume is ~ 9 m3, almost two orders of magnitude larger than the block volume of quartzite.  \n \n6. Discussion and conclusions \n \nGlacial erosional bedrock landforms show a marked contrast in morphology on different lithologies in \nan area where palaeoglaciol conditions of warm-based palaeo-ice flow were areally constant. The \ndifferences in morphology can be related to the subglacial erosional mechanisms that formed them \n(abrasion or plucking) (e.g., Evans, 1996; Benn and Evans, 1998; Glasser and Bennett, 2004).  The \ndifferences in lithology have been quantified by measuring appropriate bedrock properties.  \nSummarising, hard rocks with dense joint spacing (e.g., Cambrian quartzite) appear to be \n 8\nKrabbendam & Glasser: Glacial erosion: Abrasion vs Plucking.  MS for Geomorphology \npreferentially eroded by plucking, whilst relatively soft rocks with wide joint spacing (e.g., Torridon \nsandstone) erode preferentially by abrasion.  We note that we do not have a quantitative control on \nthe erosion rate by plucking.  This would require a detailed cosmogenic exposure age study (e.g. \nBriner and Swanson, 1998; Duhnforth et al., 2010), but even in these cases, plucking erosion rates \nare minimal values. Similar conclusions concerning the relative importance of abrasion and plucking \nwere drawn by Hancock et al. (1998) and Whipple et al. (2000) for fluvial erosion on different \nlithologies.   \n \nThe bedrock properties of the two lithologies analysed in this study are plotted against each \nother in Fig. 9.  In this graph, fields can be defined in which certain erosion mechanisms are \ndominant under given constant glacial conditions.  Thus, a \u2018plucking-dominant field\u2019 can be defined \nfor rocks that are hard but have a dense joint spacing, whilst an \u2018abrasion-dominant field\u2019 is expected \nfor softer rocks with wider joint spacing.  We suggest that these two fields are separated by a field in \nwhich plucking and abrasion are of broadly equal dominance.  The fields can be used to predict the \npreferential erosion mechanism on different lithologies, which can be quantitatively tested in future \nstudies.    \n In addition, overall glacial erosion resistance can be predicted, with low erosion resistance \nclose to the \u2018apex\u2019 and increasing erosion resistance away from the \u2018apex\u2019. Schematic \u2018erosion \nresistance\u2019 contours can be added (Fig. 9), although the shape of these contours (straight, convex, \nor concave) cannot be constrained at present, with a study of only two rock types.    We have added \nbedrock properties of some other lithologies from the literature to Fig. 9. In addition, we have shown \nthe range of Schmidt hammer rebound values for a range of rock types (Fig. 9, right-hand side) as \nreported by Deere and Miller (1966).  This allows us to explore some further implications:  \n \n(i) A lithology with a particular hardness can have highly variable joint spacing, for instance in the \nvicinity of tectonic faults.  Beacom et al. (2001) showed that, in the Lewisian Gneiss in Scotland, joint \nspacing can vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The effect of local variations in joint spacing is well \nillustrated by studies on glacial erosion of granitic rocks in Yosemite.  Mathes (1930) showed \nqualitatively that densely jointed granite in Yosemite was more susceptible to plucking than less \njointed granite; this was confirmed quantitatively by D\u00fchnforth et al. (2010) using cosmogenic nuclide \nexposure dating techniques. Thus, the presence of densely spaced joints moves the granite from \none erosion-mode field into another, as well as making it more susceptible to erosion. The \nimplication is that a particular rock type cannot be predicted to be more susceptible to subglacial \nerosion than another (cf. Phillips et al., 2010), without taking local variations in joint spacing into \naccount. \n \n(ii) Igneous and metaigneous rocks such as granites and ortho gneisses plot well away from the \napex (e.g., Lewisian Gneiss and Yosemite granite; Fig. 9).  Such rocks are hard and commonly have \na wide joint spacing.  In this field that abrasion and plucking are equally favoured.  Notably, such \nrocks are typically found in landscapes of aerial scour, and a typical mixture of whalebacks and \nroche moutonn\u00e9es have been reported in such landscapes (Gordon, 1981; Rea and Evans, 1996; \n 9\n \n \nRoberts and Long, 2005). In this field, the dominant erosion mechanism is probably largely \ndetermined by glacial conditions such as ice velocity and thickness, in the manner suggested by \nGlasser and Warren (1990) and others.  However, we suspect that for rocks that plot close to one or \nthe other axis it may not be valid to deduce glacial conditions from landforms alone.  \n \n(iii)  Rocktypes  plotting close to the apex would include friable shales, certain chalks, and deeply \nweathered bedrock, transitional to regolith.  It is likely that the distinction between plucking and \nabrasion becomes blurred in this region.  Few studies on subglacial landforms developed on such \nrocks have been performed (Lindstr\u00f6m, 1988).  This is probably because these rocks are also highly \nsusceptible to post-glacial erosion, so that few fresh landforms are preserved in the geological \nrecord, and because glacial erosion may be so efficient that debris production is very high, resulting \nin subglacial deposition of till (e.g., Phillips et al., 2010).   \n \n(iv|) Abrasion is commonly regarded as being less efficient than plucking (Briner and Swanson, \n1998; D\u00fchnforth et al., 2010).  Typically, this conclusion is based on roche moutonn\u00e9e-like \nlandforms, where it can be demonstrated that abrasion on the top and stoss side was quantitatively \nless than erosion by plucking from the lee side (e.g., Jahns, 1943; Briner and Swanson, 1998).  \nHowever, this point has only been demonstrated for hard rocks such as granite (Jahns, 1943; \nD\u00fchnforth et al., 2010) and gabbro (Briner and Swanson, 1998).  We suggest that this rule cannot be \napplied as the general case but is, in fact, dependent on rock properties.  In a relatively soft rock with \nwide joint spacing, such as the Torridon sandstone in this study, we suggest that abrasion is as \nefficient (if not more so) as plucking.  \n \nOur overall conclusion is that palaeoglacial conditions can only be inferred from glacial erosional \nlandforms in a particular deglaciated area if the effects of different bedrock properties of the \nsubstrate on erosion mechanisms are considered fully.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nTom Bradwell is thanked for early discussions.
