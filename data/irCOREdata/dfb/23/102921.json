However, the exact process of electron emission\nfrom CNTs is still not fully understood. Numerous papers\ninvestigating the field enhancement factor of an individual\nCNT have attempted to further the understanding of the\nemission process through experimental and computational\ninvestigations into geometric enhancement factor.4\u20139 It has\nlong been assumed that the effect of field screening is ne-\ngated when adjacent emitters are at a separation of twice\ntheir height.6 In this letter, we investigate the effect of field\nscreening on arrays of CNT by means of three-dimensional\n\u00013D\u0002 simulations and show the impact on device perfor-\nmance.\nCNTs were simulated in 3D in SIMION 8.0 software.10\nThe software solves the Laplace equation using finite differ-\nence with optimized linear time solving to allow extraction\nof potential and electric field at any point around the struc-\nture. An initial calibration simulation was that of a hemi-\nsphere on a grounded plane, beneath an anode at a positive\npotential. Numerically, the solution to the Laplacian equation\nin 3D for such a structure gives a local field above the hemi-\nsphere of three times that of the applied field placed infi-\nnitely far away. It was found that as long as the anode elec-\ntrode was maintained sufficiently afar as not to incur anode\nproximity effects,8,9 the enhancement factor simulated was\n3.01.\nFigure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows a schematic of the simulated array of\nCNT. Vertically aligned CNTs of uniform height h and radius\nr are placed on a grounded cathode that is separated from the\npositive anode by distance D. To simulate a realistic CNT\narray the impact of the size of the array on screening was\nexamined. We simulated five different conditions. Firstly, a\nsingle CNT of height 3 \u0001m and radius 50 nm was placed at\nthe center of the simulation work space. The simulation\npackage has a maximum of 200\u0002106 calculation points.\nThis places an upper limit on the array dimensions for simu-\nlation to ensure that the anode was sufficiently far away from\nthe CNT and that the CNT occupies sufficient points to en-\nsure the tip is suitably rounded. We also ensured our array\nstructures were positioned adequately far from the edges of\nthe simulation work area to avoid unwanted boundary ef-\nfects. The other four scenarios were the single CNT with two\nadjacent neighbors, then four, six, and eight neighbors. All\nintertube separations were kept constant at 3 \u0001m.

This implied that from here on we can simulate\nan array of nine CNTs and still be confident about the accu-\nracy of our results.\nThe as simulated array of nine CNTs is shown as a top\ndown view to Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002 where the CNTs are separated by a\ndistance S. An anode to cathode separation of 80 \u0001m was\nused, and a positive potential of 100 V applied to the anode.\nThe local field was carefully extracted at a distance immedi-\nately above the middle CNT. It can be seen that the middle\nCNT has a lower local field than that of its neighbors which\nis approximately 85% of the field experienced by the emit-\nters on the corners of the array. It was also noted on that the\nlocal field at the tip of the corner CNTs were still lower by\n8.6% than that of the isolated control simulation.11\nIt is known that two emitters in close proximity will\nreduce the local field due to screening. It has long been as-\nsumed the optimum intertube separation is twice the height\nof the CNT, or, S=2h.6 This observation has featured in\nmany publications interested in electron field emission from\nCNT,12\u201314 and in some cases given reference as a to a low\nunderstanding of field screening.15 Our array of CNTs seen\nin Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002 was simulated for intertube separations S ranging\nfrom 1 to 16 \u0001m, which corresponds to S=0.3h to 5.3h. A\npercentage of screening was calculated by the difference in\nthe local field for the middle CNT to that of an identical but\nisolated CNT. Figure 2 shows the percentage of screening for\nCNTs of radius 50 nm, height 3 \u0001m. It is observed that the\namount of screening decreases as S increases However, the\namount of screening at S=2h \u0001shown by the dotted lines\u0002\nindicate that there is still a 10% drop in local field. It is\nimportant to state that while in our simulations, only the\ncentral CNT is screened the most, in a much larger array\nover the ranges of mm2 this 10% screening would be appli-\ncable to all CNT except those at the outer edge, as demon-\nstrated for an array of 11 by 11 CNT shown in Fig. 3. It can\nbe seen that the majority of emitters within the center of the\narray exhibit similar fields. The 10% drop in local field\nmeans that at S=2h, the vast majority of the array is per-\nforming at 90% of its optimum value. To achieve a fully\nunscreened array of CNT, one needs to have an intertube\nseparation in excess of five times the height of the CNT. This\nis particularly important when investigating individual CNT\nwithin an array. To understand where the underestimate of\nscreening arises, we simulated a \u201cline\u201d of three CNTs, which\napproximates a two-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 scenario to mimick the\nwork of Nilsson et al.,12 while keeping the same dimensions\nas before. This is shown in Fig. 2 as closed circles. In this\ncase, at S=2h, the percentage of screening was found to be\n\u00032%, which informs on the origin of the \u0001now underesti-\nmated\u0002 assumption that screening is at a minimum at S=2h.\nHowever, we believe that our study of 3D arrays of CNT to\nbe more applicable to experimentally grown ordered arrays\nof emitters than the results obtained from 2D simulations.\nAs discussed previously, in a large array of emitters, the\nscreening effect is less at the edge of the array, where the\nemission current will be higher than those within the center.\nFigure 3 illustrates this effect by showing the local field\nabove and surrounding a larger emission area comprising of\n121 emitters. It is desirable in many field emission applica-\ntions to have uniform emission over the entire active area.\nBy using the effect of screening seen thus far, we can adjust\nthe position of emitters at the outermost levels to increase the\nuniformity of the array. To compensate for this, we move the\nsecond layer of emitters inwards by approximately 10% and\nthe outside layer emitters in by approximately 20% \u0001not\nshown\u0002. The knock-on effect of this is a leveling of the local\nelectric field. While the third layer of emitters was not\nmoved, it was observed that there was a slight drop in field\ndue to the movement of the first and second layers. It was\nalso noticed that the corner emitters still had a slightly higher\nlocal field. To reduce this, one needs to move the corners in\nfurther to maintain a constant screening between every emit-\nter in the array.\nIt is important to consider the effect of screening from a\npractical point of view. In order to quantify the impact of our\nfindings, we take values of CNT dimensions and FE perfor-\nmance from previous work8 and model an array of 5 mm2, at\nvarying intertube separations.\nTaking the standard Fowler\u2013Nordheim type relationship,\nbut using local field, EL in place of \u0004E we get\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Percentage of screening calculated by the difference\nin local electric field between an isolated CNT, to the middle CNT of an\narray of 3 by 3 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 7 by 7 \u0001\u0002\u0002 and 11 by 11 CNT \u0001 \u0002.

To\nexplore this effect more, we calculated the emission current\ndensity for arrays of ordered CNT that occupy an area of\n5 mm2. Plotted in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002, we see a sharp increase in cur-\nrent density as the initially tightly packed CNT become more\nseparated. A maximum current density can be observed when\nthe intertube separation approaches three times the CNT\nheight. Beyond this value, the current density decreases. The\nlinear decrease beyond S=3h would be expected, as at these\nCNT separations each emitter is unscreened, i.e., half the\nCNT equals half the current density. Increasing the un-\nscreened emission current to 2 and 3 \u0001A, we see similar\ntrends. This phenomenon is also present if we change the\nemission area. Decreasing from 5 to 2 mm2 \u0003Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004 we\nsee similar trends. We show for an ordered array of CNT the\nscreening effect diminishes when the intertube separation ex-\nceeds 5h, but practically, the most efficient arrangement of\nemitters, for maximum current density per unit area, would\nactually be 3h, giving rise to a 4% screening of the local\nfield.\nIn conclusion, we have simulated arrays of CNT emitters\nin 3D and investigated the effect of field screening in terms\nof intertube separation. We have found that the previous op-\ntimum separation of 2h to be an under estimate of screening\nin 3D, and to achieve a fully unscreened array, the optimum\nseparation needs to be in excess of five times the height of\nthe CNT. Conversely, we have shown that when considering\narrays of emitters for practical applications, there is a com-\npromise to ensure maximum efficiency in terms of current\ndensity of a separation of three times the CNT height. We\nalso demonstrate that a fuller appreciation of the screening\neffect lead to more efficient arrays but also more uniform\nemitter areas.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nPartnership program.\n1V.
