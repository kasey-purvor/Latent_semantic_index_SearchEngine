It produces high-quality research information on the costs,\neffectiveness and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care in\nthe NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined to include all interventions used to promote health,\nprevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care, rather than settings of care.\nThe research findings from the HTA Programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the\nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee\n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that\nthey form a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA Programme is needs-led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are\nthree routes to the start of projects. \nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the\nNHS, the public and consumer groups and professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS trusts.\nThese suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service\nusers). The HTA Programme then commissions the research by competitive tender. \nSecondly, the HTA Programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research\nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThirdly, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme\ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring \ntogether evidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They can\ncost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence,\nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer-reviewed by a number of independent expert referees\nbefore publication in the widely read monograph series Health Technology Assessment. \nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA monograph series\nReports are published in the HTA monograph series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA\nProgramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and editors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search,\nappraisal and synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the\nreplication of the review by others.\nThe research reported in this monograph was commissioned by the HTA Programme as project number\n05\/29\/01. The contractual start date was in September 2005. The draft report began editorial review in\nMay 2006 and was accepted for publication in February 2007. As the funder, by devising a commissioning\nbrief, the HTA Programme specified the research question and study design. The authors have been\nwholly responsible for all data collection, analysis and interpretation, and for writing up their work.

GObjectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and\ncost-effectiveness of (1) alternative strategies for the\nprevention of Staphylococcus aureus carriage in patients\non peritoneal dialysis (PD) and (2) alternative \nstrategies for the eradication of S. aureus carriage in\npatients on PD.\nData sources: Major electronic databases were\nsearched up to December 2005 (MEDLINE Extra up to\n6 January 2006). \nReview methods: Electronic searches were\nundertaken to identify published and unpublished\nreports of randomised controlled trials and systematic\nreviews evaluating the effectiveness of preventing and\ntreating S. aureus carriage on peritoneal catheter-\nrelated infections. The quality of the included studies\nwas assessed and data synthesised. Where data were\nnot sufficient for formal meta-analysis, a qualitative\nnarrative review looking for consistency between\nstudies was performed. \nResults: Twenty-two relevant trials were found. These\nfell into several groups: the first split is between\nprophylactic trials, aiming to prevent carriage, and trials\nwhich aimed to eradicate carriage in those who already\nhad it; the second split is between antiseptics and\nantibiotics; and the third split is between those that\nincluded patients having the catheter inserted before\ndialysis started and people already on dialysis. Many of\nthe trials were small or short-term. The quality was\noften not good by today\u2019s standards. The body of\nevidence suggested a reduction in exit-site infections,\nbut this did not seem to lead to a significant reduction\nin peritonitis, although to some extent this reflected\ninsufficient power in the studies and a low incidence of\nperitonitis in them. The costs of interventions to\nprevent or treat S. aureus carriage are relatively\nmodest. For example, the annual cost of antibiotic\ntreatment of S. aureus carriage per identified carrier of\nS. aureus was estimated at \u00a3179 (\u00a373 screening and\n\u00a3106 cost of antibiotic). However, without better data\non the effectiveness of the interventions, it is not clear\nwhether such costs are offset by the cost of treating\ninfections and averting changes from peritoneal dialysis\nto haemodialysis. Although treatment is not expensive,\nthe lack of convincing evidence of clinical effectiveness\nmade cost-effectiveness analysis unrewarding at\npresent. However, consideration was given to the\nfactors needed in a hypothetical model describing\npatient pathways from methods to prevent S. aureus\ncarriage, its detection and treatment and the detection\nand treatment of the consequences of S. aureus (e.g.\ncatheter infections and peritonitis).

The aim was to\nprevent, or reduce, the frequency of peritonitis. The\nreview does not cover treatment of peritonitis itself.\nBackground and intervention\nIn chronic renal failure, dialysis is used to replace\nthe kidneys\u2019 function in removing impurities and\nunwanted products of metabolism from the blood.\nPeritoneal dialysis is a form of ambulatory dialysis\nin which fluid is fed into the abdominal cavity via\na catheter through the abdominal wall. The fluid\ncollects the substances normally excreted by the\nkidney. After an interval the fluid is drained out\nagain. \nThe main complication of peritoneal dialysis in\nthe short term is infection of the peritoneal cavity,\nperitonitis. In the longer term, recurrent episodes\nof peritonitis can impair diffusion across the\nperitoneal membrane, so that peritoneal dialysis is\nno longer feasible, which means that patients have\nto attend hospital for haemodialysis, usually three\ntimes per week.\nOne of the organisms which cause peritonitis is\nStaphylococcus aureus. It can colonise parts of the\nbody without symptoms, but may cause infection\nwhere the peritoneal catheter passes through the\nskin of the abdomen. These are known as exit-site\ninfections. It may also contaminate the tip of the\ncatheter. In both situations, peritonitis may be a\nconsequence.\nVarious measures have been used to try to prevent\nor eradicate colonisation, in the hope that this will\nprevent, or reduce, the frequency of peritonitis.\nThese include antiseptics and antibiotics. The\nantibiotics can be applied locally or given\nsystemically, by mouth.\nS. aureus can develop resistance to commonly used\nantibiotics, and is then known as methicillin-\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\nEpidemiology\nEnd-stage renal failure can be a consequence of a\nnumber of diseases, the commonest being\nglomerulonephritis, diabetes, renal vascular disease,\npyelonephritis and polycystic kidney disease.\nMethods\nElectronic searches were undertaken to identify\npublished and unpublished reports of randomised\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews\nevaluating the effectiveness of preventing and\ntreating S. aureus carriage on peritoneal catheter-\nrelated infections. The main databases searched\nwere MEDLINE (1966\u20132005), EMBASE\n(1980\u20132005), CINAHL (1982\u20132005), BIOSIS\n(1985\u20132005), Science Citation Index (SCI)\n(1980\u20132005), MEDLINE Extra (6 January 2006),\nCochrane Library (Issue 4 2005), Database of\nAbstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (December\n2005) and HTA Database (December 2005). The\nquality of the included studies was assessed and\ndata synthesised. Where data were not sufficient\nfor formal meta-analysis, a qualitative narrative\nreview looking for consistency between studies was\nperformed. \nResults\nNumber and quality of studies and\nsummary of benefits\nTwenty-two trials were found. These fell into\nseveral groups: the first split is between\nprophylactic trials, aiming to prevent carriage, and\ntrials which aimed to eradicate carriage in those\nwho already had it; the second split is between\nantiseptics and antibiotics; and the third split is\nbetween those that included patients having the\ncatheter inserted before dialysis started and\npeople already on dialysis. Many of the trials were\nsmall or short-term. The quality was often not\ngood by today\u2019s standards. The body of evidence\nsuggested a reduction in exit-site infections but\nthis did not seem to lead to a significant reduction\nin peritonitis, although to some extent this\nreflected insufficient power in the studies and a\nlow incidence of peritonitis in them.\nExecutive summaryx\nCosts\nThe costs of interventions to prevent or treat\nS. aureus carriage are relatively modest. For\nexample, the annual cost of antibiotic treatment of\nS. aureus carriage per identified carrier of S. aureus\nwas estimated at \u00a3179 (\u00a373 screening and \u00a3106\ncost of antibiotic). However, without better data on\nthe effectiveness of the interventions, it is not clear\nwhether such costs are offset by the cost of treating\ninfections and averting changes from peritoneal\ndialysis to haemodialysis.\nCost-effectiveness\nAlthough treatment is not expensive, the lack of\nconvincing evidence of clinical effectiveness made\ncost-effectiveness analysis unrewarding at present.\nHowever, consideration was given to the factors\nneeded in a hypothetical model describing patient\npathways from methods to prevent S. aureus\ncarriage, its detection and treatment and the\ndetection and treatment of the consequences of \nS. aureus (e.g. catheter infections and peritonitis).\nHad data been available, the model would \nhave compared the cost-effectiveness of \nalternative interventions from the perspective \nof the UK NHS, but as such it helped identify\nwhat future research would be needed to fill \nthe gaps.\nConclusions\nThe importance of peritonitis is not in doubt. It is\nthe main cause of people having to switch from\nperitoneal dialysis to haemodialysis, which leads to\nreduced quality of life for patients and increased\ncosts to the NHS. Unfortunately, the present\nevidence base for the prevention of peritonitis is\ndisappointing; it suggests that the interventions\nreduce exit-site infections but not peritonitis,\nalthough this may be due to trials being in too\nsmall numbers for too short periods.\nRecommendations for research\nThe study identified key research questions that\nneed to be addressed. These are given below.\n\u25cf What is the natural history of carriage of\nS. aureus? What are the links between carriage\nand exit-site infection, and between exit-site\ninfection and peritonitis? What factors predict\ncarriage?\n\u25cf Is the problem mainly with MRSA, with\nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus\n(MSSA) being relatively harmless?\n\u25cf Does decolonisation work, or is recolonisation\nrapid?\n\u25cf Apart from antibiotic and antiseptic use, what\nother options for reducing peritonitis are there?\nWould more training help?\n\u25cf Should measures to eradicate carriage be\nintermittent or chronic; antiseptics versus\nantibiotics?\n\u25cf Is vaccination worth revisiting?\n\u25cf Given the common use of mupirocin in renal\nunits, research into that drug and resistance to\nit should be a priority.\nTrials are needed with larger numbers of patients\nfor longer durations.\nExecutive summaryT\nhe objectives of this review were to determine\nthe clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness\nof alternative strategies for the prevention and\neradication of Staphylococcus aureus carriage in\npatients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim was to\nprevent, or reduce, the frequency of peritonitis. \nThe review does not cover treatment of peritonitis\nitself.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n1\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

This situation\ncan be called colonisation or carriage. Other\nS. aureus carriage sites include the axillae, vagina,\nperineum and occasionally the gastrointestinal\ntract.\nHowever, although colonisation of those sites may\nnot cause any problems there, the presence of the\norganism means that more vulnerable parts of the\nbody may be first contaminated and then infected.\nIn PD, a catheter is inserted into the abdominal\ncavity though the skin of the abdominal wall and\nexits through a subcutaneous tunnel. Whenever the\nskin is broken, there is a risk of infection. Hence\npeople on PD are at increased risk because of the\nbreak in the skin. Some may also be at increased\nrisk of all infections because of the diseases which\nlead to renal failure, such as diabetes.\nPD is used more in the UK than in other countries.\nAlmost one-third of the dialysis population in the\nUK are on PD1 and 50% of PD patients are known\nto be S. aureus carriers.2 Some studies have\nreported that nasal carriage of S. aureus is more\nfrequent in diabetic and immunosuppressed PD\npatients.3,4\nPD catheter-related infections are an important\ncause of morbidity and mortality in the PD\npopulation. Such infections are classified into exit-\nsite, tunnel infections and peritonitis. An exit-site\ninfection is defined as purulent drainage at the\ncatheter exit site with or without erythema. \nA tunnel infection is an infection of the tissues\noverlying the subcutaneous portion of the\ncatheter.5 Peritonitis is inflammation of the\nperitoneal membrane. Exit-site or tunnel\ninfections cause significant morbidity as they can\nlead to refractory or recurrent peritonitis.6\nPeritonitis is associated with several adverse\nconsequences. It accounts for the majority of\noccasions when the PD catheter has to be\nremoved, leading to transfer to haemodialysis\n(HD).7,8 Peritonitis is one of the most common\ncauses for hospitalisation in PD patients.9\nIt contributes to the decline of peritoneal\nmembrane function, which means that PD may\nbecome impossible. It may also lead to a more\nrapid decline in residual renal function (i.e. some\npatients still have a little function left in their\nkidneys) and is an important predictor of survival.10\nAlthough there can be many different causes of\nPD catheter-related infections, S. aureus is an\nimportant cause. It is believed to be the leading\ncause of PD catheter exit-site infection11,12 and\none of the most frequent causes of PD-related\nperitonitis.13 It has been estimated that the\nperitonitis rates due to S. aureus are 0.09\u20130.22 per\ndialysis year.2,14 The cost of S. aureus infections in\nthe dialysis population in the USA has been\nestimated to be over US$200 million annually.15\nSeveral studies have shown a strong link between\nS. aureus carriage and PD catheter exit-site and\ntunnel infections16\u201318 and peritonitis.19,20 S. aureus\ncarriers, have a two- to six-fold higher risk of\nS. aureus peritonitis than non-carriers.2,19\nPeritonitis due to S. aureus tends to be more severe\nthan that due to other organisms, with patients\nmore likely to have fever and hypotension.21\nHospital admission may be prolonged with\nS. aureus peritonitis9 and it also increases\nmortality.22,23 Furthermore, removal of the PD\ncatheter is required more often in S. aureus\nperitonitis than with peritonitis due to other\nbacteria, to resolve the peritonitis or prevent\nrecurrence.24 Removal of the catheter means that\nPD has to be replaced by HD, requiring at least\ntemporary attendance at hospital dialysis sessions,\nusually three times per week.\nDescriptions of interventions\nStudies comparing carriage and infecting S. aureus\nisolates have shown that patients are infected with\ntheir \u2018own\u2019 organism, that is, the one they carry on\nskin or nose.2,25,26 Although S. aureus is found in\nthe body in areas other than the nose, elimination\nof nasal carriage also leads to loss of carriage in\nother sites such as hands and skin,27 implying that\nthe other parts are being reinfected from the nose.\nIn addition, the PD catheter exit site is reported to\nbe most important colonising site of S. aureus\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n3\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.\nChapter 2\nBackgroundstrains that cause peritonitis.28 These important\nobservations underpin strategies that aim to\nreduce S. aureus-related PD catheter infections and\nperitonitis.\nS. aureus is normally susceptible to a variety of\nantibiotics, the most commonly used of which is\nmupirocin, given as an ointment. \nRecommendations according to\nvarious guidelines\nVarious bodies have made recommendations,\nalthough these are not necessarily followed in\npractice.\n\u25cf Renal Association (UK):29 Peritonitis rates\nshould be less than one episode per 18 patient\nmonths. Mupirocin should be applied to the\nexit site either daily or on alternate days. Nasal\ncarriage of S. aureus should be treated with\nmupirocin twice daily for five consecutive days\nevery 4 weeks. \n\u25cf European Renal Association\u2013European Dialysis\nand Transplantation Association\n(ERA\u2013EDTA):30 Mupirocin should be applied\neither at the exit site or intranasally especially\nin patients who are S. aureus carriers. \n\u25cf International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis:31\nSeveral options are recommended: exit-site\nmupirocin daily in all patients or in S. aureus\ncarriers only or in response to positive S. aureus\nculture; intranasal mupirocin every month in\nthose identified as carriers or only in response\nto positive nose culture; exit-site gentamicin in\nall patients. \n\u25cf Caring for Australians with Renal Impairment\n(CARI guidelines):32\u201334 Prophylactic therapy\nusing mupirocin ointment, especially for\nS. aureus carriage intranasally, is recommended\nto decrease the risk of S. aureus catheter exit\nsite\/tunnel infections and peritonitis.\nIt is clear that although all guidelines recommend\nmupirocin for S. aureus nasal carriers, there is\nconsiderable variation with other\nrecommendations. There has been no systematic\nreview of evidence for the effectiveness of\ninterventions for prevention and treatment of\nS. aureus carriage in PD patients. It was against\nthis background that the NHS Research and\nDevelopment Programme for Health Technology\nAssessment (HTA) commissioned this study. \nBackground\n4Methods for reviewing\neffectiveness\nSearch strategy\nElectronic searches were undertaken to identify\npublished and unpublished reports of randomised\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews\nevaluating the effectiveness of preventing and\ntreating S. aureus carriage on peritoneal catheter-\nrelated infections. \nThe main databases searched were MEDLINE\n(1966\u20132005), EMBASE (1980\u20132005), CINAHL\n(1982\u20132005), BIOSIS (1985\u20132005), Science\nCitation Index (SCI) (1980\u20132005), MEDLINE\nExtra (6 January 2006), Cochrane Library (Issue 4\n2005), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of\nEffectiveness (December 2005) and HTA Database\n(December 2005). Searching was restricted to\nEnglish language publications only. In addition,\nrecent conference proceedings, tables of contents\nof two key PD journals and reference lists of all\nincluded studies were scanned to identify\nadditional potentially relevant studies. Full details\nof the search strategies used are documented in\nAppendix 1.\nAll titles and abstracts identified in these ways\nwere assessed to identify potentially eligible\nstudies. Two reviewers independently assessed\nthem for inclusion, using a study eligibility form\ndeveloped for this purpose (Appendix 2). Any\ndisagreements were resolved by consensus or\narbitration. Systematic reviews were used to\nidentify RCTs but were not otherwise included in\nthis review.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTypes of studies\nAll published RCTs and quasi-RCTs (e.g.\nallocation by alternation) of patients receiving PD\nfor end-stage renal disease in whom alternative\ninterventions were compared for the prevention\nand treatment of S. aureus carriage were included.\nFor the purposes of this review, studies comparing\nalternative interventions for the treatment of\nclinical infections and studies which did not\nreport outcomes separately for S. aureus were\nexcluded. \nTypes of participants\nThe trials included patients on PD for end-stage\nrenal disease from any cause.\nTypes of outcomes\nThe following measures of outcomes were sought:\nPrimary outcome:\n1. number of patients with peritonitis caused by\nS. aureus.\nSecondary outcomes:\n1. number of patients with S. aureus carriage\n2. time to S. aureus carriage\n3. peritonitis rate (number of episodes over total\npatient months on PD) caused by S. aureus\n4. time to first peritonitis episode caused by\nS. aureus\n5. peritonitis relapse (number and specify time\nto) caused by S. aureus\n6. number of patients requiring catheter removal\ncaused by S. aureus\n7. number of patients switching to HD caused by\nS. aureus\n8. number of patients requiring catheter\nreplacement caused by S. aureus\n9. number of patients with exit-site and\/or\ntunnel infections caused by S. aureus\n10. exit-site and\/or tunnel infection rate caused by\nS. aureus\n11. side-effects\n12. death due to peritonitis caused by S. aureus\n13. hospitalisation rates\n14. quality of life\n15. development of antibiotic resistance.\nData extraction strategy\nThe titles and abstracts of all papers identified by\nthe search strategy were screened. Full text copies\nof all potentially relevant studies were obtained\nand assessed for inclusion. Reviewers were not\nblinded to the names of studies\u2019 authors,\ninstitutions or sources of the reports. Any\ndisagreements were resolved by consensus or\narbitration. \nA data extraction form was developed to record\ndetails of trial methods, participants, interventions,\npatient characteristics and outcomes (Appendix 3).\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n5\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.\nChapter 3\nEfficacy and safetyTwo reviewers independently extracted data from\nthe included studies. Any differences that could\nnot be resolved through discussion were referred\nto an arbiter. \nQuality assessment strategy\nTwo reviewers, working independently, assessed\nthe methodological quality of the included studies.\nAgain, any disagreements were resolved by\nconsensus or arbitration. The system for classifying\nmethodological quality of controlled trials was\nbased on an assessment of four principal potential\nsources of bias: selection bias caused by inadequate\nconcealment of allocation of treatments; attrition\nbias caused by losses to follow-up without\nappropriate intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis;\ndetection bias caused by biased ascertainment of\noutcome where knowledge of the allocation might\nhave influenced the measurement of outcome; and\nselection bias in analysis (Appendix 3).\nData synthesis\nFor trials with multiple publications, only the most\nup-to-date data for each outcome were included.\nDichotomous outcome data were combined using\nthe Mantel\u2013Haenszel relative risk (RR) method\nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values\nwere calculated for the estimates. The results were\nall reported using a fixed-effects model. \u00012 tests\nand I2 statistics were used to explore statistical\nheterogeneity across studies and, when present,\nrandom effects methods were applied. Other\npossible reasons for heterogeneity were explored\nusing sensitivity analyses. The meta-analyses were\nconducted using the standard Cochrane software\nRevMan 4.2. \nWhere data were not sufficient for formal meta-\nanalysis, a qualitative narrative review looking for\nconsistency between studies was performed. \nResults\nQuantity and quality of research\navailable\nNumber of studies identified\nThe results of the searches are summarised in\nTable 1. The numbers retrieved from the searches\nin CINAHL, SCI, Biosis and CENTRAL and\nscreening of full text journals include only the\nadditional reports found after excluding those\nidentified from the MEDLINE\/EMBASE multifile\nsearch.\nA total of 498 titles and abstracts were identified\nfrom the various searches, of which 394 were\nclearly outwith the scope of this review. The\nremaining 104 reports (90 full text papers and 14\nabstracts) were selected for full assessment. Table 2\ndetails the numbers of these that were included\nand excluded. \nNumber and type of studies included\nTwenty-five reports (21 full text papers and four\nabstracts) describing 22 RCTs met the inclusion\ncriteria for the review and were included in the\nreview of clinical effectiveness. The majority of\nthese reports were identified from the\nMEDLINE\/EMBASE search (20), with two each\nidentified from SCI and the full text journals and\none from BIOSIS. The list of included studies and\nassociated references are listed in Appendix 4. No\nstudies were identified only from CINAHL.\nTrials fell into several groups. The first split is\nbetween prophylactic trials, aiming to prevent\nEfficacy and safety\n6\nTABLE 1 Search results\nDatabase No. retrieved\nMEDLINE\/EMBASE\/MEDLINE Extra 381\nmultifile search (after deduplication \nin Ovid)\nCINAHL 23\nSCI 56\nBIOSIS 12\nCENTRAL 2\nCDSR 1\nDARE 7\nHTA database 2\nNRR 1\nCCT 0\nClinical Trials 0\nSCI Proceedings 2\nSelected from conference abstracts 2\nSelected from full text journals 9\nTotal 498\nTABLE 2 Papers selected for full assessment\nAssessment No. of papers\nIncluded in review 25\nSystematic reviews  7\nRetained for background information 26\nExcluded \u2013 not RCTs 17\nExcluded \u2013 treatment of clinical  7\ninfections\nExcluded \u2013 outcomes not reported  22\nseparately for S. aureus carriage\nUnobtainable papers 0\nTotal 104carriage, and between trials which aimed to\neradicate carriage in those who already had it.\nThe second split is between antiseptics and\nantibiotics. The third split is between those that\nincluded patients having the catheter inserted\nbefore dialysis started and those where the people\nwere already on dialysis. \nNumber and type of studies excluded, with\nreasons for specific exclusions\nA total of 46 reports were obtained but\nsubsequently were excluded because they failed to\nmeet one or more of the inclusion criterion. Of\nthese, 17 were not RCTs, seven were concerning\nthe treatment of clinical infections and in 22 the\nauthors did not report outcomes separately for\nparticipants with S. aureus carriage (18 primary\nreports and four secondary reports).\nStudy quality, characteristics and evidence rating\nA summary of the quality assessment of the 22\nRCTs is presented in Table 3 and the detailed\nquality assessment for each of the included studies\nis reported in Appendix 5. The method of\nrandomisation used was stated explicitly for 11 of\n22 trials: a central randomisation service was used\nin one study, consecutively numbered, sealed\nenvelopes were used in one study, computer-\ngenerated random numbers were used in one\nstudy, there was consecutive allocation in two, by\nrandom numbers table in three, by date of follow-\nup in one, assigned by a third party in one and\nrandom selection by cards in one. By modern\nstandards, most of these methods are unsatisfactory,\nbut some of the trials were done some time ago. In\n11 trials, the allocation was said to be\n\u2018randomised\u2019 but the method was not specified.\nConcealment of allocation was adequate in only\none trial, suboptimal in four and unclear in 17. \nIn the majority of trials, it was unclear whether\nstudies blinded the care provider, participant,\noutcome assessor or data analyst (but it is\nquestionable if this is possible given the nature of\nthe treatments compared). Five studies included\nan ITT analysis but it was unclear if this were the\ncase for the remaining 25 studies. \nEligibility criteria were clearly specified in 21\nstudies. The mean or median duration of follow-\nup ranged from at least 48 hours to 1 year. This\nwas not reported for three studies.\nCharacteristics of included studies\nThe comparisons made and characteristics of the\nRCTs are summarised in Table 4 and a detailed\ndescription for each of the included studies is\nreported in Appendix 6. Within the 22 eligible\nRCTs, there were 30 relevant comparisons (four\ntrials had three arms). Three trials took place in\nthe UK, eight in the USA, two in Hong Kong, two\nin Brazil and one each in Spain, Turkey, Singapore\nand Canada. There were two multi-centre\nEuropean trials and one multi-centre Australia\nand New Zealand trial. Across the trials\nrecruitment dates ranged from May 1987 to\nAugust 2003. Eleven trials failed to provide\ninformation on recruitment dates. The number of\nparticipants randomised ranged from 15 to 267.\nTwo trials had more than 200 participants, eight\nmore than 100 participants and 12 fewer than 100\nparticipants. Eighteen trials gave details of the\nnumbers of men and women in each trial group.\nSeventeen trials gave details of participants\u2019 ages.\nOne trial included children only.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nTable 5 gives a summary of the outcomes reported\nin the included studies. \nProphylaxis amongst all patients\nEighteen trials evaluated prophylaxis amongst all\npatients regardless of their S. aureus status at trial\nentry. Four trials evaluated prophylaxis at the time\nof catheter insertion and the remaining trials\nconsidered prophylaxis given once dialysis had\ncommenced. Five trials compared antibiotic\ntreatment with no antibiotic treatment, four trials\ncompared two different antibiotic regimes, one\nthree-armed trial compared two different\nantibiotic regimes with no antibiotic treatment,\nthree trials compared antiseptic treatment with no\nantiseptic treatment, one trial compared two\ndifferent types of antiseptics, one trial compared a\nvaccination with combined staphylococcus\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n7\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

There were no reported\nside-effects in the group which received no\ntreatment. \nDeath due to peritonitis caused by S. aureus\nOnly one trial reported this outcome.37 This trial\ncompared neomycin 0.5 g by mouth or nasogastric\ntube every 6 hours with a placebo and reported\nthat there were no deaths due to peritonitis caused\nby S. aureus.\nDevelopment of antibiotic resistance \nOne trial43 comparing mupirocin applied to the\nexit site once weekly with mupirocin applied three\ntimes weekly reported no difference between the\ngroups (one out of seven isolations were resistant\nto mupirocin in the group applying mupirocin\nonce weekly and one isolation resistant to\nmupirocin and methicillin in the group applying\nmupirocin three times weekly).\nNo data were reported for the following outcomes:\nperitonitis relapse, number of patients requiring\ncatheter replacement, hospitalisation rates and\nquality of life.\nOral antibiotics versus no antibiotics\nFour trials compared an oral antibiotic with no\nantibiotics and one trial compared two different\ntypes of oral antibiotics with no antibiotic. When\nconsidering all oral antibiotics together, there were\nfewer cases of peritonitis caused by S. aureus in the\ngroups which received antibiotics (Figure 1: 6\/283\nversus 7\/185: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.72;\np = 0.43), but this was not a statistically significant\ndifference. There were also fewer cases of exit-site\nand\/or tunnel infections caused by S. aureus\n(Figure 2, 5\/70 versus 20\/70: RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11\nto 0.65; p = 0.003). The direction of effect was\nsimilar when considering subcategories (catheter\ninsertion and during dialysis).\nTopical antibiotics versus no antibiotics\nOnly one trial38 compared the use of a topical\nantibiotic with no antibiotics. There was no\ndifference in the number of patients with\nperitonitis caused by S. aureus.

Although this study was generally well\nconducted and reported, it did not consider the\nfull range of interventions for the prevention and\ntreatment of S. aureus carriage. As reported in\nTable 8, the use of the antibiotics reduced the rate\nof a catheter infection caused by S. aureus from\none every 28.1 months to one every 99.3 months.\nThe incremental cost per S. aureus-related catheter\ninfection prevented in 1994 prices was \u00a3187. The\ncosts included the cost of screening and\nprophylaxis for 1 year and the cost savings arising\nfrom the reduced use of therapeutic antibiotics\nand hospitalisations avoided. Quality-adjusted life-\nyears (QALYs) were not reported as part of this\nstudy. Nevertheless, the gain in QALYs required to\nprovide an incremental cost per QALY that society\nmight consider worthwhile (between \u00a320,000 and\n\u00a330,000 per QALY) would be between 0.0019 and\n0.0029. This would be equivalent to between an\nadditional 0.7\u20131.1 days in full health over 1 year\n(1 day in full health is equal to 0.00274 QALYs).\nFrom this particular study, a judgement would be\nrequired as to whether the gains in QALYs\nestimated could be realised in practice and, even if\nthey can be realised, whether society would be\nwilling to pay for these additional benefits. \nThe usefulness of the study by Davey and\ncolleagues59 is that the results indicate that it is\nnot implausible that interventions to prevent or\ntreat S. aureus carriage might be cost-effective.\nIdeally, an economic evaluation comparing all\nrelevant interventions (including the use of a no\ntreatment arm) and utilising the best available\nevidence would be performed. \nThe first part of this chapter outlines the\nframework provided by economic evaluation for\ninforming decision-making. As described in this\nsection, there is insufficient evidence to determine\nthe relative efficiency of the alternative\ninterventions. In response to the limited evidence\navailable, no economic evaluation was performed.\nHowever, a hypothetical model is outlined. If\nsufficient data were available from future research\nto populate this model, then it would provide an\nexplicit framework to estimate cost-effectiveness. \nThe economic approach\nRelationship between benefits and cost\nThe objective of economic evaluation is to provide\ninformation to assist decision-makers in the\nallocation of available scarce resources so that\nbenefits can be maximised. The decision to use\nresources in one way means that the opportunity\nto use them in other desirable ways is given up.\nThe cost of this decision is the benefits (health\ngains, etc.) that could have been obtained had the\nresources been used in another way. The\n\u2018opportunity cost\u2019 of a decision to use resources in\none way is equivalent to the benefits forgone in\nthe best alternative use of these resources. One of\nthe goals of healthcare decision-making is to\nmaximise benefits and minimise opportunity costs.\nTo achieve this, information is required on both\nresource use (i.e. costs) and benefits (i.e.\neffectiveness) from alternative courses of action. \nData on effectiveness and costs can be brought\ntogether in a matrix format (Figure 10) to aid in\nthe judgement about whether a new procedure is\npreferable to a comparator. In Figure 10, it can be\nseen that, relative to a comparator, the new\nprocedure could achieve (1) greater effectiveness,\n(2) the same level of effectiveness or (3) less\neffectiveness. Of course, a fourth option is possible\nwhereby there is not enough evidence to make a\njudgement on whether the new procedure is more\nor less effective. In terms of cost, a new procedure\ncould (A) be less costly, (B) result in no difference\nin costs or (C) be more costly (again, there is the\npossibility of there being not enough evidence to\njudge, as represented by row D). \nFigure 10 is adapted from that which appeared in\nearly editions of the Cochrane Collaboration\nHandbook. For any procedure to prevent or treat\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n21\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

In squares A1, A2 and B1, the new\nprocedure is more efficient and is assigned a \u2713\nresponse to the question of whether it is to be\npreferred to current practice. In squares B3, C2,\nand C3 the new procedure is less efficient and\nthus receives a \u2715 response. In squares A3 and C1,\na judgement would be required as to whether the\nmore costly procedure is worthwhile in terms of\nthe additional effectiveness gained. Square B2 is\nneutral, as there is no difference in either costs or\neffectiveness and other reasons may be needed to\njustify the adoption of treatment. The areas\nmarked with a ? response represent situations in\nwhich there is not enough evidence on\neffectiveness, costs or both to judge whether the\nnew procedure is to be preferred.\nConsideration of the available evidence\nAs reported in Chapter 3, the evidence available\non relative effectiveness of the alternative methods\nof preventing or treating S. aureus carriage as a\nmeans of preventing peritonitis was limited. In\nterms of the matrix set out in Figure 10 there is\ninsufficient evidence to draw any conclusions\nabout relative effectiveness (column 4 of the\nmatrix), and hence about the relative cost-\neffectiveness of any of the interventions (square\nD4 of the matrix). Additional data collection is\nrequired to conduct a formal economic evaluation.\nThe structure for a hypothetical economic model\nis presented in the next section. \nHypothetical economic model\nThe methods for a model and its use are\nillustrated below, and this helps to highlight the\nareas where additional data would be required\nbefore a robust evaluation could be conducted. A\nMarkov model is used to display the temporal and\nlogical sequence of prevention and treatment\nevents. This approach adopted as a Markov model\nhas the ability to represent repetitive events, and\nthe time dependence of both probabilities and\nutilities which allows for more accurate\nrepresentation of clinical settings that involve\nthese issues.60 The model would be designed to\nestimate costs from the UK NHS perspective and\noutcomes in terms of QALYs. \nThis study focuses on patients who receive PD as\nthe initial modality of treatment. A patient who\nelects or receives PD could over time either die,\nreceive a transplant or transfer to HD. The\nhypothetical model does not include\ntransplantation and hence may be considered\napplicable to the majority of patients who, for\nwhatever reason (usually lack of donor organs), do\nnot receive a transplant. As part of the process of\ndeveloping the model, the parameters needed to\nassess the cost-effectiveness of alternative\ninterventions were identified. The systematic\nreview of effectiveness reported in Chapter 3,\nsecondary data sources and consultation with\nclinical experts would provide the parameter\nestimates. Where such data were likely to be\ndeficient, this has been indicated in the text, to aid\nfuture research. The model structure was based on\nEconomic evaluation\n22\nEffectiveness\ndecreasing\nCost\nincreasing\n\u2713\u2713 ?\n\u2713\u2713  \u2715\u2715 ?\n\u2715\u2715 ?\n????\n1234\nA\nB\nC\nD\n  \u2713  = recommended experimental treatment\n  \u2715  = recommended control\n\u2713 \u2715 = neutral\n  = judgement required\n   ?  = not enough evidence\nCompared with control treatment, \nexperimental treatment is:\n1. more  effective\n2.  of equal effectiveness\n3. less  effective\n4.  insufficient evidence to judge\nA. less  costly\nB.  of equal cost\nC. more costly\nD. insufficient evidence to judge\nFIGURE 10 Matrix combining costs and effectivenessdetailed discussions with clinical members of the\nreview team about the care pathways that patients\nmight follow while on PD and further discussion\nabout how these pathways (and transitions\nbetween different modalities of treatment and\nclinical events) would be influenced by the\nprevention or treatment of S. aureus carriage. The\nmodel was then presented to the clinicians and\nother members of the review team and any\nrelevant changes made to the structure.\nDescription of the model\nThe model is made up of a set of health states\nbetween which a patient can move over specified\nperiods of time (Figure 11). On entry into the\nmodel, all patients receive PD. The patient will\nspend 4 weeks in each state (the cycle length)\nbefore facing the possibility of making a transition\nto another state. \nWithin the model patients could move into any\none of the following states: \n1. \u2018Catheter insertion\u2019. In this initial state a patient\nhas their peritoneal catheter inserted and\nbegins PD. At the time of their peritoneal\ncatheter insertion the patient may receive a\nprophylactic intervention or a treatment of \nS. aureus carriage. Following the first 4 weeks\nafter insertion of the catheter, a patient may\nremain on PD with or without carriage of \nS. aureus. Patients in this state could potentially\nalso develop an infection, transfer to HD or die.\n2. \u2018On PD without SA carriage\u2019. In this state, the\npatient receives PD and may also receive\nroutine checks for the development of S. aureus\ncarriage. The risk of developing carriage and\nhence the probability of moving to \u2018On PD with\nSA carriage\u2019 may be affected by the use of some\nform of prophylactic preventive treatment\neither at the time of catheter insertion (the first\ninitial state of the model) or while on dialysis.\nPatients in this state could potentially also\ndevelop an infection, transfer to HD or die.\n3. \u2018On PD with SA carriage\u2019. Patients in this state\nare still on PD but are carriers of S. aureus. \nIf S. aureus carriage were eradicated, the\npatient would move back to the state \u2018On PD\nwithout SA carriage\u2019. The patient could suffer\nsome form of infection although the risk of this\nhappening may be affected by any of the\nmethods of treating S. aureus carriage\n(antibiotic sprays, ointment or powders).\nPatients in this state could potentially also\ntransfer to HD or die.\n4. \u2018Infection\u2019. While on PD, a patient may suffer an\nexit-site infection, isolated tunnel infection or\nperitonitis. The infections may occur either\nseparately or sequentially: exit site infection\nleading to tunnel infection leading to\nperitonitis. While in this state, patients face the\nrisk of losing their PD tube and moving into\ntemporary or permanent HD. Factors that\ncould make a person move from PD are\nclearance failure, technique failure or recurrent\nperitonitis. The types of infection and there\neffects are:\n(a) Exit-site infection, which is treated with\nusing a local treatment, systemic treatment\nor catheter change. \n(b) Isolated tunnel infections, which are\ntreated using systemic treatments and\/or\ncatheter removal. \n(c) Peritonitis infection, which is mainly due to\ncontamination and is treated with 2 weeks\nof antibiotics administered peritoneally,\nintravenously or orally. \nS. aureus infection can be cured without the\npatient moving from PD (i.e. move to \u2018On PD\nwithout SA carriage\u2019). If S. aureus infection is\nnot resolved, the catheter can be removed and\nthe treatment modality switched to \u2018Temporary\nHD\u2019. Non-resolution of S. aureus infection can\nbe attributed to failure of antibiotics to clear\nthe infection (relapsing peritonitis) or it may\narise from an entirely new infection. Relapsing\nperitonitis can be defined as the recurrence of\nperitonitis caused by the same organism as the\nimmediately preceding episode of peritonitis\nwithin 4 weeks of completion of antibiotic\ntreatment. The model would allow a patient to\nhave a maximum of between two and four\ninfections (i.e. to stay in the state of infection\nfor between two and four cycles) before the PD\ncatheter is removed, in which case the patient\nwould move to the state of \u2018Temporary HD\u2019. \n5. \u2018Temporary HD\u2019. As briefly described above,\nthere are several factors that could make a\nperson move from PD, such as clearance\nfailure, technique failure or recurrent\nperitonitis. Once these factors are resolved\nsome patients may elect to move back to PD. If\nthey are not resolved, a patient may have to\nstay in HD until they die (and hence move to\nthe state of \u2018Permanent HD\u2019). \n6. \u2018Permanent HD\u2019. Once a patient enters this state,\nthey do not leave it until they die.\n7. \u2018Dead\u2019 (included as all-cause mortality). This\nstate can be entered from all preceding states. \nWhile the model allows for variation in the\nparameters of the prevention and treatment of\nperitonitis across each intervention (either\nprophylactic prevention of S. aureus carriage or\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n23\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The following\nsection identifies the data required to populate the\nmodel. To illustrate this description, the data\navailable for the comparison of the prophylactic\nuse of antibiotics at the time of catheter insertion\ncompared with no treatment have been used. \nEstimation of model parameters\nA detailed description of the methods that might\nbe used to derive parameters for this model are\ndescribed in Appendix 7. In brief, this description\ncovers the derivation of transition probabilities,\ncosts and health state utilities. \nAssessment of cost-effectiveness\nThe results of the base-case analysis would be\nbased on the costs and outcomes faced by male\nand female patients who initially started on PD. \nIf the National Institute for Health and Clinical\nExcellence (NICE) HTA guidelines were followed,\ndiscount rates of 3.5% per annum would be\napplied to both costs and health benefits.61 The\ncentral outcomes of the analysis and the systematic\nreview would first be presented in terms of a\nbalance sheet. In the balance sheet the incremental\ndifferences between the alternative interventions\nwould be presented in their natural units, such as\nthe number of patients with exit-site and\/or tunnel\ninfections caused by S. aureus and number of\npatients with peritonitis. The purpose of the\nbalance sheet is to illustrate the trade-offs that\nwould exist when choosing amongst interventions. \nWithin the economic model, the different\noutcomes would be combined into a single\nmeasure of relative efficiency measured in terms of\nthe incremental cost per QALY. Data on the\nincremental cost per QALY would be presented in\ntwo ways. First, mean costs and QALYs for the\nalternative interventions could be presented and\nincremental cost per QALYs calculated where\nappropriate. The second way in which the cost-\neffectiveness of the alternative interventions might\nbe presented would be by cost-effectiveness\nacceptability curves (CEACs). CEACs can be used\nto illustrate the uncertainty caused by the\ncombined statistical variability in the model\u2019s\nparameter estimates. These curves illustrate the\nlikelihood that a strategy is cost-effective at various\nthreshold values for society\u2019s willingness to pay for\nan additional QALY. It should be noted that in\norder to be able to perform the probabilistic\nsensitivity analysis underpinning the estimation of\nCEACs, all the parameters required for the model\nshould be described by an appropriate statistical\ndistribution that reflects the statistical imprecision\nsurrounding the point estimates (which has not\nbeen attempted within this chapter). \nAdditional analyses\nThe results of any economic evaluation will be\nsurrounded by uncertainty. In part, this will be\nreflected by the probabilistic analysis that is\nproposed above. However, other sensitivity\nanalyses would be required to address the\nuncertainty around the available data or about the\nway in which it would be used in the model. In\naddition to the sensitivity analyses described\nabove, another potential sensitivity analysis might\nfocus on establishing at what point preventing or\ntreating carriage ceases to be cost-effective.\nExamples of other potential sensitivity analyses are\ndescribed below. \nRisks of S. aureus carriage, risks of progression\nto infection and other transition probabilities\nData on the prevalence of S. aureus carriage are\nnot available, yet it is likely that the cost-\neffectiveness will be dependent on the proportion\nof people starting PD who are carriers of S. aureus\nand the risks of developing carriage and the\nconsequences of carriage in terms of the\ndevelopment of infections and transitions to other\nmodalities of dialysis. \nCosts\nThe costs of antibiotics identified varied greatly.\nThe most expensive and least expensive costs\ncould be used in the sensitivity analysis. These\ncosts could be varied by increasing\/reducing them\nto establish at what cost prevention or treatment of\nS. aureus carriage and infection ceased to be cost-\neffective. Similarly, the costs of dialysis would also\nbe varied. This is because costs that would be used\nin the base-case analysis although coming from a\nvery detailed costing exercise are derived from a\nsmall number of centres and so might not be\ngeneralisable to the rest of the NHS. The impact\nof using other relevant costs such as those reported\nin the NHS reference costs would be explored.\nUtilities\nThe utility data used in the model were based on\nnon-randomised data. These data were based on\npatient responses to the EQ-5D questionnaire\nweighted using UK population tariffs. Further\nanalyses could be performed using the utility data\nfrom other sources.\nResults\nAlthough no formal attempt to conduct the\nproposed modelling exercise has been made, an\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n25\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

As \ncan be seen, the data available are very limited\nand due to the paucity of data no further analyses\nwere carried out.\nSummary\nIn this chapter, a hypothetical model for the\ncomparison of alternative methods to prevent or\ntreat S. aureus carriage has been presented. The\npurpose of this exercise was to consider what\ninformation would be required for an economic\nevaluation and where the main information gaps\nare. There is insufficient information on the\neffectiveness and relative effectiveness of the\ninterventions that might be considered. Better\ndata are available for costs and utilities but further\ndata collection would be helpful. In particular,\nevidence on the utility value for those\nexperiencing any of the infections would be useful. \nAs the model is hypothetical, the structure\noutlined in this chapter may need to be adapted\nto reflect either new knowledge of the care\npathways, restrictions imposed by the data\navailable or the nature of the comparisons\nconsidered. \nEconomic evaluation\n26\nTABLE 11 Balance sheet of antibiotic versus no antibiotic at catheter insertion and during dialysis\nFavours antibiotic Favours no  Trials contributing \nintervention data\nTrends towards fewer exit-site and\/or tunnel infections (OR 0.15,  Lower costs 4\n95% CI 0.06 to 0.3)\nNo statistically significant difference in \nnumber of patients with peritonitis (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.72) 8\nNo information on:\nNumbers of S. aureus carriage\nNumber of S. aureus cured\nNumber with relapse\nModality change rates\nOR, odds ratio; RR, relative risk.Volume of evidence\nThere is a good number of trials but, as discussed\nin Chapter 3, the quality of design, or at least of\nreporting, is not good by today\u2019s standards. The\nfirst priority is to determine whether treatments\nare effective, and this requires placebo controls.\nMany of the trials were of one antibiotic or\nantiseptic against another. Table 12 shows those in\nwhich there was a placebo arm. The number falls\nto 13. Some of these were very small, for example\nthose by Bennett-Jones and colleagues35 with 26\npatients, Blowey and colleagues54 with 15 and\nSesso and colleagues58 with 31 amongst three\narms.\nA number of the trials show a reduction in exit-site\ninfections but not in the incidence of peritonitis.\nThis may just be a power problem (exit-site\ninfections being much commoner than peritonitis,\nplus the relatively small numbers involved), but\nraises the question of the relationship between\ncarriage, infection and peritonitis. It is likely that\ninfection is introduced mainly at exchange via\ncontamination of the tip of the catheter, rather\nthan tracking along the tunnel. Better technique\nmight reduce the risk.\nIn an observational study, the Scottish Renal\nRegistry Group62 noted that peritonitis was 15%\n(95% CI 4 to 26%) less common in units using\nnasal mupirocin than those not, although this did\nnot apply to S. aureus peritonitis (one episode\nevery 106 months in user units versus one every\n96 months in non-users; p = 0.52).\nOther reviews\nOur findings are similar to those of the Cochrane\nReview by Strippoli and colleagues,63 who also\nconcluded that nasal mupirocin reduces exit-site\nand tunnel infections, but not peritonitis. \nGuideline 3I of the European Guidelines30 states\nthat, \u201cUse of mupirocin or gentamicin cream at\nthe exit site is recommended to reduce exit site\ninfections\u201d, but cites no evidence that this reduces\nperitonitis. Like the other guidelines, they have to\nextrapolate from reduction in exit-site infections\nto reduction in peritonitis.\nOne issue of concern has been the emergence of\nresistance to mupirocin, especially in MRSA.\nMupirocin became available in 198564 and some\nlaboratories have reported increasing numbers of\nmupirocin-resistant S. aureus, especially MRSA.64\nParticularly high resistance rates have been\nreported from New Zealand, but that may be\nrelated to its availability over the counter without\nprescription.65 In some European studies, high-\nlevel mupirocin resistance was seen in only 2\u20133%\nof S. aureus isolates,66,67 but there was variation\namongst countries, from 0% in most up to 6% in\nBelgium and 5% in the UK. Much higher rates\nhave been reported in units with high mupirocin\nuse. In one neonatal intensive care unit, which\napplied mupirocin routinely to insertion sites of\ncentral venous catheters, resistance rates rose over\n5 years to 42% of coagulase-negative staphylococci\n(no results for S. aureus were reported), falling\nagain once the routine use was stopped.68\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n27\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

What is the natural history and biology of\ncarriage? What are the links between carriage\nand exit-site infection, and between exit-site\ninfection and peritonitis? How long does\ncarriage last for without treatment? How often\nis it temporary rather than permanent? The\nnatural history of MRSA carriage suggests that\nup to half of those colonised will clear\nspontaneously within 1 year.70\n2. How do we define carriage? Some centres take\nswabs from multiple sites. But there is evidence\nthat eradication from the nose reduces carriage\nelsewhere. Other sites include throat, groin,\ngut, any wounds and the catheter. Site of\ncarriage seems to be important.\n3. Treatment of carriage. Is MSSA relatively\nharmless? MRSA carriage seems to be a much\nstronger predictor of infection than MSSA\n(about 50% by 18 months versus 2% with\nMSSA).71 Should the focus be on those with\nMRSA? Is decolonisation of proven\neffectiveness, or is recolonisation rapid? Typing\nof strains could separate relapse from\nreinfection. Most decolonisation efforts are\ndirected to the nose, which is the most\ncommon site of carriage, and to the catheter\ninsertion site, but topical application of\nantibiotic or antiseptic to these sites will not\naffect carriage elsewhere, unless carriage\nelsewhere requires repeated spread of the\norganism from its more favoured sites.\nIndividual strain type may also be important.\n4. What other options for reducing peritonitis\nmight be tried? Would more training help?\n5. What factors predict carriage \u2013 home contacts,\nsmoking, recent antibiotic treatment, recent\nhospital admissions? The underlying disease,\nsuch as diabetes, may affect susceptibility to\ninfection.\nEradication topics include:\n\u25cf intermittent versus chronic\n\u25cf antiseptics versus antibiotics\n\u25cf the choice of drug\n\u25cf is vaccination worth revisiting?\nThe design of any intervention trial should\nconsider confounding factors such as type of\ncatheter, training and automated PD versus\nambulatory PD.\nThe choice of antibiotic(s) to be tested in trials\nshould take into account susceptibility of\nindividual strains, and these may vary amongst\ndifferent dialysis centres. MRSA rates also vary,\nand its presence is likely to compromise the\nbenefits of any \u0002-lactam antibiotic. MRSA strains\nalso vary in their susceptibility to other key\nantibiotics such as gentamicin, rifampicin, fucidin,\nneomycin and mupirocin, though probably not to\nantiseptics. Long-term studies would be needed to\nmonitor the emergence of resistance \u2013 this is high\nrisk for agents such as mupirocin and rifampicin.\nSome agents such as mupirocin, rifampicin and\nfucidin are active mainly against Gram-positive\ninfections.\nThe widespread use of mupirocin, and the\nconcerns about resistance, make it a high priority\nfor research.\nThe key outcomes of research into prevention\nwould be:\n\u25cf Episodes of peritonitis \u2013 average number per\npatient per annum in population on PD in each\nunit.\n\u25cf Patient-based data \u2013 number of patients having\none or more episodes per annum, or over a\nlonger period; time from first insertion of\ncatheter to first episode of peritonitis. Even if\nthe number of infections was the same, delaying\ninfection would be a useful outcome.\n\u25cf Numbers of temporary transfers to HD.\n\u25cf Duration of successful treatment on PD.\nRepeated episodes of peritonitis will shorten the\nlife of the peritoneal membrane as a dialysis\nmembrane.\nDiscussion\n28T\nhe importance of peritonitis in PD is not in\ndoubt, and it remains the main cause of\ntransfer to HD. The evidence on prevention is\ndisappointing: exit-site infections are reduced but\nnot peritonitis, although this may be because the\nstudies were too small or too short, or because the\nincidence of peritonitis was low. There is also some\nconcern about the development of resistance to\nmupirocin amongst MRSA strains. More research\nis required.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n29\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The outcomes of the systematic\nreview of effectiveness were primarily presented in\nterms of relative effect sizes (RRs) for the\ncomparison of prophylactic antibiotic with no\ntreatments. By identifying the relevant transition\nprobabilities for the \u2018no treatment\u2019 intervention\nand combining with relevant relative effect sizes\nfor the prophylactic antibiotic intervention, the\ntransition probabilities for this intervention can be\nderived.\nEstimation of baselines comparator\ntransition probabilities \nOne source of data on the relevant transition\nprobabilities for this is the control arms of studies\nthat compared an active treatment with no\ntreatment. Table 13 describes the parameters used\nto determine transitions between the states of the\nmodel. The data that might be used for these\nparameters are described below.\nTransition probabilities from \u2018Catheter\ninsertion\u2019\nFollowing the initial insertion of the PD catheter a\nperson would receive PD, although they may have\na risk of being a carrier of S. aureus. Ideally, the\nrisk of S. aureus carriage would come from a large\npopulation based survey of patients pre-dialysis.\nSome data on the risk of S. aureus carriage at the\ntime of catheter insertion could be obtained from\nsystematic review of effectiveness36,46 (see Table 6).\nThese sources provide rates of S. aureus carriage of\nbetween 18.0 and 30.8% and a crude mean of\n27.0% (46 cases out of 167 trial participants). In\nthe model, it would be assumed that 27% of those\nwho do not die less those who experience an\ninfection (see below) would transfer into the state\nof \u2018On PD with SA carriage\u2019. \nThe risk of infections caused by S. aureus following\ncatheter insertion could also be provided by review\nof effectiveness data. The systematic review of\neffectiveness sought to identify the number of\npatients with peritonitis, peritonitis rates,\nperitonitis relapses, exit-site and tunnel infection\nrates. Although the aim was to identify exit-site,\ntunnel and peritonitis infections separately, most\nof the studies reported exit-site\/tunnel infections\ntogether (Chapter 3). Table 6 provides details on\nthe number of patients without S. aureus carriage\nwho develop peritonitis and also the mean\nnumber of episodes per patient year. The data\nfrom the no treatment arms of these studies can\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n59\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

In a full model, the different types of\ninfection might be defined as individual states that\nwould allow them to occur either singularly or in\nsequence.be used to provide some information of the risks\nof infection (and types of infection) per year.\nHowever, very few data are available.39 A crude\nestimate of the risk of peritonitis per patient per\nmonth would be 1.3%. A similar estimate for the\nrisk of exit-site or tunnel infections would be 5.4%.\nSuch data come from a small study and hence are\nimprecise and unreliable.39 Ideally, such data\nwould be replaced by data from a larger study.\nData are also required on the risk of infections for\nthose with S. aureus carriage. Data from the no\ntreatment arms for comparisons of alternative\nmethods to treat S. aureus carriage provided by the\nsystematic review are one source of data55 (Table 8).\nHowever, such data are not comparable to the\nrisks of infections for those without S. aureus\ncarriage. For example, from the data available, the\nrisk of peritonitis per patient per month can be\ncalculated as 1.9% and the risk of exit-site and\ntunnel infections as 3.6%. It might be expected\nthat the infections caused by S. aureus would be\ngreater in the group that were known carriers of\nS. aureus. Ideally, the information on infection\nrates amongst those who are and are not carriers\nof S. aureus would come from a single study of\nsufficient size to provide reasonably precise and\nreliable data for a UK setting.\nSurvival rates or death rates for patients on PD\nwould also be needed. The Renal Registry has\npublished survival rates derived from data on \n3-year survival rates using Kaplan\u2013Meier survival\nanalysis.1 To use such data would require that the\nproportion of people dying from S. aureus\ninfection while on PD is only a small proportion of\nthe total risk of death on PD. \nTransition probabilities from \u2018On PD\nwithout SA carriage\u2019\nPatients who are S. aureus free can remain on PD\nuntil they die either free of S. aureus carriage or\nbecome carriers of S. aureus. These is insufficient\ninformation on the risk that a patient might\ndevelop S. aureus carriage from the review of\neffectiveness, but one study reported how the risk\nof S. aureus nasal carriage changes over time.51\nThis study is small and even though such data\ncould be used in the model, they are likely be \nboth imprecise and unreliable. Ideally, such data\nshould come from the control arm of a large RCT\nor from a large cohort study relevant to a UK\nsetting.\nAs indicated in Table 10, a patient on PD but free\nof S. aureus also faces the probability of developing\nan infection or dying. The data required to derive\nthe relevant transition probabilities could be\nderived using similar methods to those outlined\nfor the transitions from \u2018Catheter insertion\u2019.\nThe remaining transition probability required\nfrom the state \u2018On PD without SA carriage\u2019 is the\ntransition to HD. The review of effectiveness\nsought to establish the number of patients\nrequiring catheter replacement\/removal (and\nhence requiring temporary HD, a clinically\npossible transition but not one allowed for this\nstate in this hypothetical model) and the number\nof patients permanently switching to HD (unclear\nwhether this included both permanent and\ntemporary transfers). Although some data were\nreported on catheter removal for those with\nS. aureus carriage (see Table 6), no data were\nidentified on the number of patients switching\nmodality. A search of the Renal Registry indicated\nthat the sequential annual risk of switching from\nPD to HD permanently was 11% at the end of the\nfirst year, 18% at the end of the second year and\n23% at the end of the third year (based on data\nfor patients established on PD in 1998\u20139, the most\nrecent years for which data are available).1 From\nsuch data, monthly transition probabilities might\nbe estimated. \nTransition probabilities from \u2018On PD\nwith SA carriage\u2019\nSimilar methods and data sources would be\nrequired to estimate the transition probabilities\nfrom this state as those described for transitions\nfrom \u2018Catheter insertion\u2019 and \u2018On PD without SA\ncarriage\u2019. \nTransition probabilities from \u2018Infection\u2019\nIdeally, the likelihood that an infection is cured\nwould be derived by consideration of the data on\nthe effectiveness of interventions to treat S. aureus\ninterventions. The most appropriate source of\nsuch data would not be the review of effectiveness\nreported in Chapter 3 but a new review of studies\nlooking at alternative treatments of infections (the\ndata from such a review are presented in\nAppendix 8). From such a review, data would be\nextracted on the likelihood of infections that do\nnot resolve and the risk of death or transferring\nmodality. Following consultation with the clinical\nco-reviewers, it has been assumed in the model\nthat should a patient suffer three consecutive\nmonths (cycles) of infection that they would\nautomatically transfer to the state of temporary HD. \nTransition probabilities from\n\u2018Temporary HD\u2019\nPatients who enter this state will remain in it for\nonly one cycle; at the end of that cycle, they may\nAppendix 7\n60either transfer to the state \u2018On PD without SA\ncarriage\u2019, transfer to the state of \u2018Permanent HD\u2019\nor die. The risk of death is not likely to be greatly\ndifferent to the rates used for earlier states.\nHowever, there is no evidence available on the\nlikelihood of returning to PD or moving to\npermanent HD. Data from the Renal Registry\nsuggest that patients rarely switch from HD to PD\n(approximately 3% per annum), but these\nnumbers may not be applicable for the group of\npatients who switch to HD only until their\nsymptoms resolve. Ideally, data from a well-\ndesigned study would be useful but, as this is only\na transitory state, sensitivity analysis could be\nconducted over a range of plausible values.\nTransitions from \u2018Permanent HD\u2019\nIn the model, it is assumed that once patients are\ntransferred to HD they will stay in this state until\nthey die. The Renal Registry has published\nsurvival rates using Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis\nand these data could be used to establish the\nrelevant transition probabilities. \nEstimation of relative effect sizes\nData on relative effect sizes for an active treatment\ncompared with no treatment (e.g. antibiotics\nversus no antibiotics for the prevention of\ncarriage) can, when combined with the transition\nprobabilities for no treatment, be used to estimate\nthe transition probabilities for the an active\ntreatment, e.g. prophylactic antibiotics. The\nvarious relative effect sizes estimated as part of the\nreview of effectiveness are presented in Figures 1\u20137.\nAlthough such relative effect sizes could be used in\na model, they are limited as they are based on\nsparse data, and a full evaluation comparing all\nrelevant interventions would rely on indirect\ncomparisons. Details of the data available for\ncomparison of antibiotics provided at the time of\ncatheter insertion compared with no treatment are\nprovided below.\nS. aureus carriage cure rates\nThis relative effect size is needed to estimate the\nprobability of entering \u2018PD without SA carriage\u2019\nand \u2018PD with SA carriage\u2019 states following\nprophylactic use of antibiotics at the time of\ncatheter insertion. From the review of\neffectiveness, no data were available on the ability\nof prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheter\ninsertion to prevent infection with S. aureus. Some\nestimate could be obtained by considering the\neffectiveness of antibiotics at curing those with\nknown S. aureus carriage. Table 8 reports the\nresults on the number of people treated for\nS. aureus carriage during dialysis. The number of\npatients cured (those who did not have S. aureus at\nthe end of the treatment) could therefore be\nderived from these data. \nS. aureus infection rates\nThese relative effect sizes would be used to\nestimate the likelihood of developing an infection.\nData are not available split by whether the\ninfections occurred in those who were S. aureus\ncarriers and those who were not. Although\nconsideration of data provided in Figures 1, 2, 5\nand 6 might provide some information with which\nplausible estimates could be derived. Nevertheless,\nideally such data would be more usefully derived\nfrom the participant-level data from a large\ncontrolled study. \nExit site\/tunnel and peritonitis cure\nrates\nOnce an infection has occurred, the assumption\nwould be made that the probability of cure would\nbe independent of the intervention used to\nprevent or treat S. aureus carriage. Thus, the\ntransition probabilities from the state of \u2018Infection\u2019\nfollowing the use of prophylactic antibiotics would\nbe the same as those following no treatment. What\nwould vary between the two interventions would\nbe the probability of an infection. \nModality changes\nFew studies provided any data on the number of\npatients switching modality from PD or the\nnumber of patients requiring catheter removal\n(and at least a move to temporary HD). The\nstudies identified in Chapter 3 were not designed\nto provide such data and provided, at best, only\nproxy indicators. Such data as are available are\npresented in Tables 6 and 8 but are both imprecise\nand potentially unreliable due to the small size of\nthe studies. Furthermore, such data would ideally\nbe split by those who were S. aureus carriers and\nthose who were not carriers. Ideally, such data\nwould be more usefully derived from the\nparticipant-level data from a large controlled study. \nRelative effect sizes for the risk of modality\nchanges from the states of \u2018Infection\u2019, \u2018Temporary\nHD\u2019 and \u2018Permanent HD\u2019 would not be required\nas these transition probabilities are assumed to be\nindependent of the method used to prevent or\ntreat S. aureus carriage. \nDeath or survival rates\nExactly the same situation arises for relative effect\nsizes associated with the risk of death as those\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n61\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.noted above for changes in modality. Again, data\nfrom a large controlled study would be useful.\nSuch a study would need to have sufficiently long\nenough follow-up to capture differences in survival\n(and other relevant effects).\nCost data\nThe perspective of the assessment of costs would\nbe that of the NHS and Personal Social Services.\nResource use data would be identified from\npublished studies, healthcare service utilisation\ndata and advice from experts in this field. Cost\ndata used to illustrate this part of the hypothetical\nmodel were mainly extracted from the literature\npublished in 1999 and were inflated to 2005 using\nthe Hospital and Community Health Services\n(HCHS) pay and price inflation indices72 and the\ncurrency used is pounds sterling (\u00a3). The main\ncost components were the costs of the\ninterventions themselves and the costs of treating\nan infection or the consequences of an infection\n(e.g. a change in modality or the replacement of a\ncatheter). Details of the cost values used are\nreported in Table 14 and the methods used to\nderive these values are described below. \nEstimation of the cost of catheter\ninsertion\nThe cost of inserting a peritoneal catheter was\nderived from Kirby and Vale.73 These costs were\ncalculated by identifying items of resource use\nfrom studies and by consulting the renal\nadministrator at NHS Grampian. Local prices\nwere then attached to each item and drug costs\nobtained from nationally available sources. The\ncost of access was estimated at \u00a31955 in 1999\n(\u00a32235 in 2004 prices). The same cost would be\nused for patients who required a replacement \nof a PD catheter (following a period on \ntemporary HD). \nEstimation of the cost of interventions\nto prevent or treat S. aureus carriage\nData on patients who received antibiotics were\nderived from a published study.59 The cost data\nreported were based on the consideration of the\nunit dose, route of administration, doses per day\nand duration of therapy. The total cost of 1 year\u2019s\ntreatment per identified carrier of S. aureus was\n\u00a3157 (at 1994 prices) and this comprised costs of\n\u00a364 for screening and \u00a393 for antibiotics. These\ncosts were based on one antibiotic (mupirocin).\nThe inflated annual cost per identified carrier of\nS. aureus is \u00a3179 (\u00a373 for screening and \u00a3106 for\nantibiotic).\nEstimation of the costs of treating\ninfections\nData on patients who received antibiotics were\nderived from a published study59 and the costs of\ntreatment were comprised of unit dose, route of\nadministration, doses per day and duration. The\nstudy indicated that the mean costs of treating\ninfections were highly skewed. The mean costs of\ntreating all infections (exit-site infections and\nother infections) was \u00a3178 for the prophylaxis\ngroup and \u00a3379 for the placebo group at 1994\nprices. The difference between the means was not\nstatistically significant \u2013\u00a3201 (\u2013\u00a3493 to \u00a390). The\ncost data inflated to 2005 prices were \u00a3203 for the\nprophylaxis group and \u00a3433 for the placebo\ngroup.\nEstimation of the costs of providing\ndialysis\nThe cost data for these interventions included\nconsumables such as catheters and prophylactic\ntreatments, staff costs, capital costs of providing\nHD, overheads and transport where necessary.\nThese data were based on data provided by the\nEURODICE study (Wordsworth S, Health\nEconomist, Oxford: personal communication,\n2005). This study was an observational study\ninvestigating the costs, effects and cost-\neffectiveness of PD and HD in 10 European\ncentres, two of which were in the UK. Costs in\neach centre were detailed data on the use of\nresources required for the different dialysis\nmodalities in use. These were collected between\n1999 and 2001 during site visits, detailed\nexamination of records and the completion of\nquestionnaires by manager, healthcare\nprofessionals and patients. In this review, data\nfrom the two UK centres (Aberdeen and Dundee)\nwould be used as they are most likely to be\napplicable to the UK. The five main categories\nincluded in the estimation of costs were\nconsumables, staff, capital, overheads and patient\ntransport. The consumables were composed\nmainly of disposable items such as dialysers, line\nand recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO).\nStaff costs were based on weekly work rosters from\nthe units which detailed the time devoted to the\nprovision of HD and PD. The capital costs for HD\nwere composed of building costs, dialysis machine,\nrepairs, water treatment and computers. Although\nPD typically takes place outwith the hospital, some\nhospital costs would normally be incurred. The\ncapital costs of PD were based on building costs,\nweighing scales, bag warmers, drip stand and\nblood pressure monitor. Staff costs were derived by\nidentifying the salary grades of those who spent\ntime with the patients (both medical and nursing)\nAppendix 7\n62and the amount of time they spent with the\npatients. Overhead costs included floor space\nallocation that was composed of cleaning,\nbuilding, engineering, local government authority\ntaxation on buildings (rates), water, energy and\noccupied bed days allocation that were composed\nof medical records, linen and catering. The total\ncost of HD for 1 month was \u00a32458 and for PD\n\u00a31603 at 2005 prices.\nEstimation of costs of change in\nmodality\nOne of the main effects of infections is the need to\nremove and replace the catheter and the cost of\nchange in modality of treatment. The cost of loss\nof catheter\/catheter replacement is based on the\ncost of a catheter, which is \u00a32235 as reported\nabove. The cost of switch in modality is the cost of\nHD, including creation of the access fistula. These\ndata were also derived from Kirby and Vale and\nwere estimated using the same methods as\ndescribed for the cost of catheter insertion.73 The\ncost was \u00a31959 (1999 prices), which was inflated to\n\u00a32240 (2005 prices). \nEstimation of quality of life\nThe main measure of effectiveness that would be\nused within the economic evaluation is QALYs.\nQALYs would be estimated by multiplying the\nlength of time spent in each health state by a\nquality of life weight (a utility value) for that state.\nA search for studies on quality of life identified\none study.74 The data came from 165 dialysis\npatients and were elicited using the EQ-5D\ninstrument. Their results indicated that patients\nundergoing hospital HD had a utility score of\n0.66, satellite HD patients had a value of 0.81,\ncontinuous ambulatory PD patients had a value of\n0.71 and continuous cycling PD patients had a\nvalue of 0.81. As these do not come from an RCT,\nthese utility scores are influenced by the choice of\nmodality for each patient (i.e. there may be a\nselection bias). Although the utility scores for\npatients with end-stage renal disease were\nidentified, there were no data on utilities of people\non dialysis with infections. \nAnother further source of utility values was the\ndata collected by the European Dialysis and Cost\nEffectiveness (EURODICE) study. This study\nprospectively identified cohorts of patients starting\non HD and PD and collected EQ-5D data from\npatients on 1 July 1998 and 31 October 1999\nevery 6 months for a period of 2\u20133 years. Health\nstate utilities were collected from all study\nparticipants including those from two UK centres\n(Aberdeen and Dundee). These data had not been\npreviously reported but were obtained from the\nstudy researchers (Caskey F, Consultant\nNephrologist, Bristol: personal communication,\n2005)75,76 and the utilities were derived using the\nUK population tariffs.77\nThe modality of first treatment was assumed to be\nthe method the patient was receiving at 90 days\nand not the initial dialysis method, as many\npatients, especially those being referred late to\nrenal units, undergo a brief period of HD before\nbeing established on PD. Utility scores for this and\nthree other time points (collected every 6 months)\nwere estimated from the data provided. Secondary\nanalysis was also carried out on the scores of\npatients who transferred from PD to HD.\nHowever, the numbers of patients changing\ntreatment modality from PD to HD were very low,\nso the estimates were not reliable. Although there\nis not much detail on what type of HD and PD was\nbeing administered by the 12th month, EQ-5D\nvalues are similar to these reported by de Wit and\ncolleagues.74 The utility value for patients\nreceiving PD was 0.84 and for those receiving HD\nit was 0.69. These scores could therefore be used\nas the utility scores associated with \u2018PD without SA\ncarriage\u2019, \u2018PD with SA carriage\u2019, \u2018Temporary HD\u2019,\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 23\n63\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.
