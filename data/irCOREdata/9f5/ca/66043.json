(2005), support a model\nin which Sun proteins tether nesprins in the ONM via in-\nteractions spanning the PNS. In this way, Sun proteins\nand nesprins form a complex that links the nucleoskeleton\nand cytoskeleton (the LINC complex).\n \nIntroduction\n \nThe existence of distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic compart-\nments is dependent upon the presence of a selective barrier\ncalled the nuclear envelope (NE). The NE consists of several\nstructural elements (Burke and Stewart, 2002; Gruenbaum et\nal., 2005), the most prominent of which are the inner and outer\nnuclear membranes (INM and ONM, respectively). In most\ncells, these two membranes are separated by a regular gap of\n \n\u0001\n \n50 nm, which is known as the perinuclear space (PNS). Peri-\nodic annular junctions between the two membranes form\naqueous channels between the nucleus and the cytoplasm that\naccommodate nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and, therefore,\npermit the movement of macromolecules across the NE.\nIn addition to its connections to the INM at the periphery\nof each NPC, the ONM also exhibits numerous continuities\nwith the ER, to which it is functionally related. In this way,\nthe INM, ONM, and ER form a single continuous membrane\nsystem. Similarly, the PNS represents a perinuclear extension\nof the ER lumen.\nThe final major structural feature of the NE is the nuclear\nlamina. This is a relatively thin (\n \n\u0001\n \n50 nm) protein meshwork\nassociated with the nuclear face of the INM. The major compo-\nnents of the lamina are the A- and B-type lamins (Gerace et al.,\n1978). These are members of the larger intermediate filament\nfamily, and, like all intermediate filament proteins, they feature\na central coiled-coil flanked by nonhelical head and tail do-\nmains (Gerace and Burke, 1988). The lamins are known to in-\nteract with components of the INM as well as with chromatin\nproteins. In this way, the lamina provides anchoring sites at the\nnuclear periphery for higher order chromatin domains.\nIn mammalian somatic cells, there are two major A-type\nlamins (lamins A and C) encoded by a single gene, \n \nLmna\n \n (in\nmice). The B-type lamins, B1 and B2, are encoded by two sep-\narate genes (Hoger et al., 1988, 1990; Lin and Worman, 1993,\n1995). Although B-type lamins are found in all cell types, the\nexpression of A-type lamins is developmentally regulated\n(Stewart and Burke, 1987; Rober et al., 1989). Typically, A-type\nlamins are found in most adult cell types but are absent from\nthose of early embryos. Mutations in the \n \nLMNA\n \n gene have been\n \nCorrespondence to Didier Hodzic: dhodzic@cellbiology.wustl.edu; \nor Brian Burke: bburke@anatomy.med.ufl.edu\nAbbreviations used in this paper: ABD, actin-binding domain; INM, inner nuclear\nmembrane; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; NE, nuclear envelope; NPC,\nnuclear pore complex; ONM, outer nuclear membrane; PNS, perinuclear\nspace; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short inhibitory RNA.\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\n JCB \u2022 VOLUME 172 \u2022 NUMBER 1 \u2022 200642\n \nlinked to a variety of human diseases (Burke and Stewart,\n2002), many of which are associated with large-scale perturba-\ntions in nuclear organization. These observations have rein-\nforced the view that the lamina is an important determinant of\nnuclear architecture and has an essential role in the mainte-\nnance of NE integrity.\nDespite their numerous connections, the INM and ONM\nare biochemically distinct. Proteomic studies have revealed the\nexistence of at least 50 integral membrane proteins that are en-\nriched in NEs. Many of these appear to reside within the INM\n(Schirmer et al., 2003). Proteins become localized to the INM\nvia a process of selective retention (Powell and Burke, 1990;\nSoullam and Worman, 1995; Ellenberg et al., 1997). In this\nscheme, membrane proteins synthesized on the peripheral ER\nor ONM may gain access to the INM by lateral diffusion via\nthe continuities at the periphery of each NPC using an energy-\ndependent mechanism (Ohba et al., 2004). However, only\nthose proteins that can interact with nuclear or INM\/lamina\ncomponents are retained and concentrated.\nThe recent identification of ONM-specific integral mem-\nbrane proteins has raised some puzzling issues (Zhang et al.,\n2001; Zhen et al., 2002; Padmakumar et al., 2004). In particu-\nlar, what prevents ONM proteins from simply drifting off into\nthe peripheral ER? This question was originally addressed in\n \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n \n, where the localization of Anc-1, a\nvery large type II ONM protein involved in actin-dependent\nnuclear positioning, was shown to be dependent upon Unc-84,\nan INM protein (Starr and Han, 2002). Localization of Unc-84\nitself was found to be dependent upon the single \n \nC. elegans\n \nlamin (Lee et al., 2002). Based upon these findings, Starr and\nHan (2003) and Lee et al. (2002) proposed a novel model in\nwhich Unc-84 and Anc-1 would interact across the PNS via\ntheir respective lumenal domains. In this way, Unc-84 would\nact as a tether for Anc-1.\nIn mammalian cells, two giant (up to 1 MD) actin-bind-\ning proteins have been identified (variously termed NUANCE,\nnesprin 2 Giant [nesp2G], nesprin 1, enaptin, Syne 1, syne 2,\nand myne 1) as integral proteins of the ONM (Apel et al., 2000;\nZhang et al., 2001; Mislow et al., 2002; Zhen et al., 2002; Pad-\nmakumar et al., 2004). These belong to a very large family of\nproteins encoded by the nesprin 1 and 2 genes (Zhang et al.,\n2001) and consist of a bewildering variety of alternatively\nspliced isoforms. The nesprins are related to Anc-1 as well as\nto a \n \nDrosophila melanogaster\n \n ONM protein, \n \nKlarsicht\n \n (Welte\net al., 1998; Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999), in the possession of\na 60\u2013amino acid COOH-terminal KASH domain \n \n(\n \nKlarsicht\n \n,\nAnc-1, and Syne homology). This domain comprises a single\ntransmembrane anchor and a short segment of \n \n\u0001\n \n40 residues\nthat resides within the PNS.\nOne of the defining features of Unc-84 is a region of\nhomology consisting of \n \n\u0001\n \n200 amino acids with Sad1p, a\n \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe\n \n protein that is associated with the\nspindle pole body (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995). This region of\nhomology is known as the SUN domain (Sad1p and UNc-84)\nand is believed to extend into the PNS. Mammalian cells also\ncontain several SUN domain proteins. At least one of these,\nSun2, has been shown to be an INM protein with the appropriate\ntopology in which the SUN domain is localized in the PNS\n(Hodzic et al., 2004). It is tempting to speculate, based upon\nthe model of Starr and Han (2003), that SUN domain proteins\nfunction as tethers for ONM-associated nesprins in mamma-\nlian cells.\nRecently, Padmakumar et al. (2005) have shown that lo-\ncalization of nesp2G to the ONM is dependent upon an inter-\naction with another mammalian SUN domain protein, Sun1.\nIn this study, we provide evidence that Sun1 is inserted into\nthe INM in such a way that its SUN domain, like that of\nSun2, faces the PNS. In this way, we can conclusively dem-\nonstrate that Sun1 does indeed have the appropriate orienta-\ntion, as assumed by Padmakumar et al. (2005), for its COOH-\nterminal domain to interact with the nesp2G KASH domain.\nThe NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal region of both Sun1 and 2 face the nucleo-\nplasm and interact with lamins. Surprisingly, our results indi-\ncate that Sun1 has a very strong preference for prelamin A.\nSun1 is the only nuclear membrane protein described to date\nthat exhibits such binding activity. This raises the distinct pos-\nsibility that Sun1 may be involved in the targeting and assem-\nbly of newly synthesized lamin A. Finally, we demonstrate that\nSun1 and 2 share some degree of functional redundancy and\nthat both of these proteins cooperate in tethering nesp2G in\nthe ONM. This tethering involves the establishment of mo-\nlecular interactions that span the PNS and contributes to the\nremarkably regular spacing that is observed between the\nONM and INM. Based upon our findings and upon those of\nPadmakumar et al. (2005), we are able to conclude that Sun1\nand 2 function as key links in a molecular chain that connects\nthe actin cytoskeleton via giant nesprin proteins to nuclear\nlamins and other components of the nuclear interior. We now\nrefer to this assembly as the LINC complex (linker of nu-\ncleoskeleton and cytoskeleton).\n \nResults\n \nWe have previously shown that Sun2 is an INM protein featur-\ning an NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal nucleoplasmic domain and a significantly\nlarger COOH-terminal domain that is localized within the PNS\n(Hodzic et al., 2004). This lumenal region of Sun2 contains a\nCOOH-terminal SUN domain that is also found in \n \nC. elegans\n \nUnc-84. The SUN domain is found in at least two additional\nmammalian proteins (Fig. 1 A): Sun1 (GenBank\/EMBL\/DDBJ\naccession no. BC048156) and Sun3 (GenBank\/EMBL\/DDBJ\naccession no. BC026189).\nSun1 transcripts are present in a variety of tissues and cell\ntypes (Fig. 1 B). A comparison of Sun1 sequences in GenBank\nreveals that it exists in multiple, alternatively spliced isoforms.\nThis conclusion is supported by Northern blot analysis, which\nreveals at least four or five discrete Sun1 transcripts in different\ntissues. We have not, however, surveyed these tissues for Sun1\nisoforms. Immunofluorescence experiments using a polyclonal\nantibody raised against recombinant human Sun1 suggests that\nlike Sun2, Sun1 is localized largely, if not exclusively, to the\nNE (Fig. 1 C). This is consistent with the appearance of Sun1\nas well as Sun2 in a proteomic screen for NE-specific membrane\nproteins (Schirmer et al., 2003).\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\n SUN\u2013NESPRIN INTERACTIONS \u2022 CRISP ET AL.\n \n43\n \nTo further address the issue of Sun1 localization, we\nfused an HA epitope to the NH\n \n2\n \n terminus of the largest isoform\nof mouse Sun1. After transfection into HeLa cells, the exoge-\nnous protein was found by immunofluorescence microscopy to\nbe enriched at the NE (Fig. 1 D). At high expression levels, al-\nthough still concentrated in the NE, HA-Sun1 began to appear\nin the peripheral ER (Fig. 1 D). Together, these observations\nconfirm that Sun1 is a nuclear membrane protein. Similar ex-\nperiments with HA-tagged Sun3 revealed a distribution that\nwas more typical of an ER protein (not depicted). Furthermore,\nNorthern blot analysis suggests that Sun3 is found primarily in\nthe testis (not depicted). Consequently, all of our subsequent\nexperiments focused on Sun1 and 2.\nThe primary structure of mouse Sun1 reveals no NH\n \n2\n \n-\nterminal signal sequence. However, two distinct hydrophobic\ndomains, H1 and H2, are present (Fig. 2 A). H1 lies between\nresidues 241 and 258, whereas the second and larger domain,\nH2, lies between residues 356 and 448. The presence of ex-\ntended hydrophobic regions clearly raises questions concerning\nthe topology of Sun1 within the nuclear membranes. An earlier\nstudy on Sun2 has shown that the SUN domain resides within\nthe PNS (Hodzic et al., 2004). Is this also the case for Sun1?\nTo address this, we used in vitro transcription\/translation of\nSun1 (tagged and untagged) both in the presence and absence\nof microsomes (Fig. 2 B). Digestion of Sun1 translation prod-\nucts with proteinase K revealed the existence of a 65\u201370-kD\nprotected fragment in samples containing microsomes. Proteinase\nK digestion in the presence of Triton X-100 to permeabilize the\nmicrosomal membranes resulted in the complete loss of the\nprotected fragment. Given the size of this protected fragment\nand the location of potential transmembrane domains, the most\nreasonable orientation for Sun1 would place its COOH terminus,\nincluding its SUN domain, within the microsome lumen. By\nextension, the SUN domain should thus reside within the PNS\nin vivo. This orientation is supported by additional experiments\ndescribed below.\nTo examine the roles of the two hydrophobic segments\nin Sun1 membrane anchoring, we took advantage of naturally\noccurring splice isoforms. Searches of GenBank reveal sev-\neral mammalian Sun1 cDNAs lacking sequences within the\nNH\n \n2\n \n-terminal domain. Comparisons with genomic sequences\nindicate that at least one splice isoform of Sun1 lacks exons\n6\u20138, corresponding to a deletion of residues 222\u2013343 (Fig. 2 C).\nThis particular Sun1 isoform is missing the first hydrophobic\nsegment, H1. When this isoform (Sun1\n \n\u0001\n \n6\u20138) was tagged with\nHA and transfected into HeLa cells, its localization at the NE\nwas found to be indistinguishable from full-length Sun1 (Fig.\n2 D). Translation of Sun1\n \n\u0001\n \n6\u20138 in vitro in the presence of mi-\ncrosomes revealed a protease-resistant fragment identical in\nsize with that derived from full-length Sun1 (Fig. 2 C). This\nfinding presents us with two conclusions. First, it proves that\nthe protected fragment must be derived from the COOH-terminal\nportion of the molecule. Second, if this first hydrophobic seg-\nment in Sun1 were to represent a transmembrane domain, its\nremoval should logically alter the topology of the subsequent\nmembrane-spanning sequences of Sun1 (i.e., H2) within the\nER or nuclear membranes. This might potentially lead to the\nflipping of lumenal segments of newly synthesized Sun1 to\nthe cytoplasmic aspect of the ER membrane or failure to insert\nH2 sequences into the membrane. Evidently, this does not\nhappen in any detectable way. Therefore, our conclusion is\nthat given this first hydrophobic sequence in Sun1 is dispens-\nFigure 1.

Further second-\nary structure analyses of Sun1 using HMMTOP (Tusnady and\nSimon, 2001) indicate that the larger hydrophobic segment,\nH2, is capable of spanning the ER\/nuclear membranes three\ntimes. Although this conformation for H2 still requires bio-\nchemical confirmation, it suggests that Sun1 is a multispanning\nprotein in which the NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal domain faces the cyto-\nplasm, whereas the COOH-terminal domain (including the\nSUN domain) is localized to the lumenal space.\nTo further examine Sun1 distribution and orientation in\nvivo, we prepared a form of mouse Sun1 that was tagged with\nan HA epitope at the NH\n \n2\n \n terminus and a myc epitope at the\nCOOH terminus (Fig. 3, HA-Sun1\u2013myc). These analyses took\nadvantage of the fact that low concentrations of digitonin can\nbe used to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane of\ncells while leaving the nuclear membranes and ER intact\n(Adam et al., 1990). For these experiments, HeLa cells ex-\npressing HA-Sun1\u2013myc were fixed with formaldehyde and\npermeabilized on ice for 15 min with 0.003% digitonin. The\ncells were then labeled with either rabbit anti-myc or rabbit\nanti-HA. After PBS washes to remove unbound antibodies, the\ncells were refixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and fur-\nther incubated with mouse antibodies against either HA or\nmyc. In this way, the first tag could be assayed for accessibility\nat the nuclear surface, whereas the second tag could be used to\ndefine the localization and expression level of HA-Sun1\u2013myc.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the myc tag was never visible at the nuclear\nsurface (or at any other location) after digitonin permeabilization\nregardless of the expression level of HA-Sun1\u2013myc. The HA\ntag was also undetectable at the nuclear surface after digitonin\npermeabilization of cells expressing low levels of HA-Sun1\u2013\nmyc. At high expression levels, however, the tag was detect-\nable at the nuclear surface and was associated with a cytoplas-\nmic reticular structure corresponding to the peripheral ER.\nClearly, the NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal, but not the COOH-terminal, domain\nof ER-associated Sun1 is exposed to the cytoplasm. Altogether,\nthese findings are consistent with the view that Sun1 is a com-\nponent of the INM and that its COOH-terminal domain resides\nwith the PNS.\nThe aforementioned data, as well as our previously pub-\nlished study (Hodzic et al., 2004), indicate that the NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal\ndomains of Sun1 and 2 are exposed to the nucleoplasm and,\nconsequently, are accessible for interaction with nuclear com-\nponents. Given the role that such interactions play in the ap-\npropriate targeting of INM proteins, it is not surprising that the\nlumenal domain of Sun1 is entirely dispensable with respect to\nSun1 localization (Fig. 4 A). In this respect, Sun1 mimics\nSun2 (Hodzic et al., 2004). Additional experiments suggest\nthat Sun1 and 2 share overlapping interactions. Overexpres-\nsion of HA-Sun1 in HeLa cells causes displacement of endog-\nenous Sun2 from the NE (Fig. 4 B). However, the converse is\nnot the case (not depicted). The implication is that Sun1 and 2\nshare a subset of interactions that are required for Sun2 local-\nFigure 2. Sun1 is a transmembrane protein with a lumenal COOH-terminal domain.

(B) When translated in vitro either in the presence\nor absence of microsomes, HA-tagged mouse Sun1, labeled with [35S]methionine\/cysteine, appears as a \u0001100-kD band, as revealed by SDS-PAGE.\nSubsequent proteinase K digestion of HA-Sun1 that had been translated in the presence of microsomes lead within 30\u201360 min to the quantitative loss of\nthe full-length HA-Sun1 and the appearance of an \u000165\u201370-kD protected fragment (arrowhead). Inclusion of Triton X-100 in the digest to permeabilize the\nmicrosomes leads to the complete degradation of HA-Sun1 within 60 min. (C) An alternatively spliced isoform of Sun1 (\u00016\u20138) lacks the first hydrophobic\ndomain (H1). When translated in vitro in either the presence or absence of microsomes, HA-Sun1\u00016\u20138 appears as a band that is predictably smaller than\nthe full-length protein. However, both full-length HA-Sun1 and HA-Sun1\u00016\u20138 that were translated in the presence of microsomes and subjected to digestion\nwith proteinase K yield identically sized protected fragments (arrowhead). Inclusion of Triton X-100 in the digestion reaction results in degradation of both\nproteins. (D) Immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells transfected with HA-Sun1\u00016\u20138 reveals that the exogenous protein is localized at the NE. In this\nrespect, HA-Sun1\u00016\u20138 is indistinguishable from full-length HA-Sun1. HA-Sun1\u00016\u20138 is detected with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody.

Sun1 retention must be dependent upon additional\nbinding partners.\nWith what proteins might the Sun1 and 2 nucleoplasmic\ndomains interact? Our initial thoughts were that the Sun pro-\nteins might associate with lamina components. To address this,\nwe first adopted an in vitro approach to determine whether A-\nand B-type lamins could interact with the NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal domain\nof either protein. We prepared a GST fusion protein containing\nthe first 165 amino acids of the Sun2 sequence (Sun2N165).\nThis represents most of the Sun2 nucleoplasmic domain. A\nsimilar, although slightly larger (the first 220 amino acids),\nfusion protein was also prepared using Sun1 sequences that\nencompassed the bulk of the nonalternatively spliced region of\nthe nucleoplasmic domain (Sun1N220). This region of Sun1\nexhibits significant sequence similarity to the NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal\ndomain of Sun2 over a region of \n \n\u0001\n \n120 residues (Fig. 4 C), al-\nthough Sun1 does display a unique 50-residue NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal\nextension. Both of these fusion proteins as well as a GST con-\ntrol were used in pull-down experiments using in vitro trans-\nlated lamins as targets.\nFour lamin species were used in these experiments (Fig.\n4 D): lamin B1 (LaB1), lamin C (LaC), full-length lamin A\n(FL LaA), and mature lamin A. Full-length lamin A contains a\nCaaX motif and should be farnesylated in the reticulocyte ly-\nsate (Vorburger et al., 1989). However, it does not undergo\ndetectable COOH-terminal proteolysis because the microsome-\nfree in vitro translation mix lacks the appropriate processing\nenzymes. The mature lamin A cDNA contains a premature\nstop codon at position 647. In this way, it mimics processed\n(i.e., mature) lamin A. As shown in Fig. 4 D, GST-Sun2N165\nbound all four lamin species, although the interaction with\nlamins B1 and C appeared barely more than the background\nobserved with GST alone. Similarly, GST-Sun1N220 was also\nfound to interact with all four lamin species. As was the case\nwith Sun2N165, the interactions with lamins B1 and C were\nrelatively weak. However, Sun1N220 showed a very strong\npreference for unprocessed (full-length lamin A) versus mature\nlamin A.\nTo determine whether these in vitro interactions might\nhave any relevance in vivo, we prepared HA-tagged versions of\nboth Sun1N220 and Sun2N165. Upon introduction into HeLa\ncells, both proteins accumulated within the nucleoplasm (Fig.\n4 E), although a significant cytoplasmic pool was always\npresent. We also prepared a form of lamin A (preLaA) contain-\ning an L647R mutation. This lamin A mutant is cleavage resis-\ntant and, therefore, retains its farnesylated COOH-terminal\npeptide. Cotransfection of HeLa cells with preLaA along with\neither HA-Sun1N220 or HA-Sun2N165 lead to a dramatic de-\ncline in the nucleoplasmic concentration of both Sun protein\nfragments coincident with recruitment to the nuclear periphery.\nLamin B1, on the other hand, had no such effect. These results\nindicate that the Sun proteins do indeed have the capacity to\ninteract with lamin A in vivo.\nTo determine whether this interaction with lamin A is re-\nquired for Sun2 retention at the NE, we first performed im-\nmunofluorescence experiments on fibroblasts derived from\nboth wild-type and \n \nLmna\n \n-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n(MEFs). Although Sun2 was detected at the NE of all wild-\ntype cells, in the majority of \n \nLmna\n \n-null MEFs, Sun2 was dis-\npersed throughout cytoplasmic membranes (Fig. 5 A). At first,\nthese results do indeed implicate A-type lamins in the appro-\npriate localization of Sun2 within the INM. However, there is\nclearly a minority of \n \nLmna\n \n-null cells in which Sun2 is fully re-\ntained at the NE (Fig. 5 A, inset). Furthermore, loss of Sun2\nfrom the INM is not reversed simply by introducing lamin A\nand\/or C by transfection into \n \nLmna\n \n-null MEFs (not depicted).\nEvidently, although A-type lamins could contribute to Sun2\nlocalization, they are not the only determinants. This sugges-\ntion is reinforced by experiments in HeLa cells in which we\neliminated A-type lamins by RNA interference (RNAi). After\n48\u201372 h of RNAi treatment, lamin A\/C was undetectable in\nmany cells. However, the NE localization of Sun2 was barely\naffected (Fig. 5 C).\nIn contrast to Sun2, we could find no evidence whatso-\never for any lamin-dependent localization of Sun1. We took the\nFigure 3. The SUN domain of Sun1 is located within the PNS, whereas\nthe NH2-terminal domain is exposed to the nucleoplasm. To examine the\norientation of Sun1, HA and myc epitope tags were placed at the NH2\nand COOH termini, respectively. HeLa cells were transfected with the dou-\nble-tagged construct and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy\nafter 24 h. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.003% digi-\ntonin and incubated with an anti-epitope tag antibody (mouse monoclonal).\nSubsequently, the cells were refixed and permeabilized with Triton X-100\nto expose the lumenal compartment to a second anti-epitope tag antibody\n(rabbit polyclonal). Neither epitope tag was significantly detectable after\ndigitonin permeabilization in HeLa cells expressing low to moderate levels\nof HA-Sun1\u2013myc. After Triton X-100 permeabilization, both myc and HA\nwere readily detected at the NE. In HeLa cells with elevated expression of\nHA-Sun1\u2013myc, the HA but not myc epitope tag was detected at the ER af-\nter digitonin permeabilization. Both myc and HA tags were identifiable\nafter treatment with Triton X-100. These data indicate that the NH2- and\nCOOH-terminal domains of Sun1 reside on opposite sides of the INM,\nwith the COOH-terminal domain located in the PNS.\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\n JCB \u2022 VOLUME 172 \u2022 NUMBER 1 \u2022 200646\n \napproach of introducing HA-Sun1 into both wild-type and\n \nLmna\n \n-null MEFs. In either case, exogenous Sun1 was always\nfound at the nuclear periphery (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, in HeLa\ncells depleted of A-type lamins by RNAi, endogenous Sun1 al-\nways remained concentrated at the NE (Fig. 5 C). Regardless\nof A-type lamin content, we have never observed cells in which\nSun1 is substantially mislocalized. Thus, although Sun proteins\ndemonstrably interact with A-type lamins, this interaction is\nnot required for their localization in the INM.\nStudies in \n \nC. elegans\n \n have shown that the prototype SUN\ndomain protein Unc-84 is required for the appropriate localiza-\ntion of Anc-1 in the ONM (Lee et al., 2002; Starr and Han,\n2002). Giant nesprin family members are also known to local-\nize to the ONM (Zhang et al., 2001; Zhen et al., 2002; Padma-\nkumar et al., 2004) and, like Anc-1, feature a COOH-terminal\nKASH domain. Therefore, we examined the role that mamma-\nlian SUN domain proteins might play in the localization of one\nof these nesprin proteins (nesp2G; \n \n\u0001\n \n800 kD).\nTo accomplish this, we raised an antibody against the\nNH\n \n2\n \n-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) of nesp2G. The af-\nfinity-purified antibody recognized a very large (\n \n\u0002\n \n400 kD)\nprotein on Western blots of HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 6 A). At\nlonger exposure times, lower molecular mass bands appeared,\npossibly corresponding to smaller nesprin 2 isoforms (Zhang et\nal., 2001) or to degradation products. Immunofluorescence mi-\ncroscopy using digitonin permeabilization revealed that the\nanti-nesp2G antibody decorated the cytoplasmic surface of the\nNE (Fig. 6 B, mock). This labeling pattern was abolished by\nRNAi treatment of cells using nesprin 2\u2013specific SmartPool\noligonucleotides. Clearly, our antibody recognizes a very large\nONM-associated nesprin 2 isoform, which is almost certainly\nnesp2G. Permeabilization of non\u2013RNAi-treated cells with\nTriton X-100 yielded additional intranuclear labeling (unpub-\nlished data). This confirms a previous study suggesting that\nsmaller nesprin 2 variants reside within the nucleus (Zhang et\nal., 2005). For all of our subsequent experiments, we used digi-\nFigure 4. Interactions between the nucleoplasmic domains of Sun1 and 2 with A-type lamins. (A) An HA-Sun1\u0001L construct lacking the SUN domain and\nmost of the lumenal coiled-coil localizes to the NE in a manner similar to the full-length protein. Anti-HA labeling is in red, whereas DNA, visualized with\nH\u00f6chst dye, is in blue. (B) Overexpression of HA-Sun1 leads to the loss of endogenous Sun2 in HeLa cells, suggesting that these two proteins share\ncommon binding partners. (C) A ClustalW alignment of the NH2-terminal sequences of mouse Sun1 and 2 identifies multiple clusters of homologous amino\nacids within a region of \u0001120 residues. Sun1 exhibits a unique NH2-terminal extension of 50 amino acid residues. (D) The first 222 residues of Sun1 or\nthe first 165 residues of Sun2 (this represents the entire nucleoplasmic domain of the latter) were fused to GST and, with GST alone (Coomassie stain, bottom),\nwere used to pull down 35S-labeled, in vitro translated lamins B1, C, mature A, and full-length (FL) A (Total). Unlike GST alone, Sun1N220 and Sun2N165\npulled down lamins B1, C, and mature A at similar levels. However, Sun1N222 displayed a higher affinity for FL LaA than did Sun2N165. Evidently,\nSun1 has a very strong preference for full-length (or pre) lamin A over mature lamin A (or full-length lamins C and B1). (E) An HA tag was inserted at the\nNH2 terminus of the same nucleoplasmic segments of both Sun1 and 2 (as described in D), and the tagged proteins were expressed in HeLa cells. Both of\nthese exogenous proteins appear enriched in the nucleoplasm (top). As observed by deconvolution microscopy, cotransfection of the myc-tagged full-\nlength lamin A (green) with HA-Sun1N222 or HA-Sun2N165 (red) resulted in the recruitment of both HA-Sun proteins to the NE (middle). Myc\u2013lamin B1,\nin contrast, fails to produce such an effect. Evidently, the nucleoplasmic domains of Sun1 and 2 can interact with lamin A in vivo.\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\n SUN\u2013NESPRIN INTERACTIONS \u2022 CRISP ET AL.\n \n47\n \ntonin permeabilization to ensure that we were looking exclu-\nsively at nesp2G that was localized in the ONM.\nTo explore the roles of Sun1 and 2 in nesp2G localiza-\ntion, we first adopted an RNAi-based approach. When we de-\npleted HeLa cells of either Sun1 or 2 (Fig. 6, C and D), we\ncould find little effect on the localization of nesp2G at the\nONM (Fig. 6, C and E). However, codepletion of Sun1 and 2\nled to the elimination of nesp2G from the ONM (Fig. 6, C and E).\nQuantitative analysis indicated an 80% reduction in the number\nof cells with detectable NE-associated nesp2G after codeple-\ntion of Sun1 and 2 versus mock RNAi treatment (Fig. 6 E).\nUltrastructural analyses revealed changes in NE morphology in\ncells codepleted of both Sun proteins. Mock-treated cells dis-\nplayed the usual uniform spacing between the ONM and INM\nof \n \n\u0001\n \n50 nm. In the double RNAi-treated cells, however, the\nONM was clearly dilated with obvious expansion of the PNS to\n100 nm or more (Fig. 6 F).\nIf SUN and KASH domain proteins form a molecular\nlink across the PNS (Starr and Han, 2003), it should be possible\nto use a dominant-negative approach to break this linkage. In this\nstrategy, we used almost the entire lumenal domain of Sun1\nFigure 5. A-type lamin independent retention of SUN domain proteins at\nthe NE. (A) Endogenous Sun2 is frequently, but not always (inset), lost\nfrom the NE in Lmna-null MEFs. In wild-type MEFs, Sun2 is always found at\nthe NE.

In the merged im-\nages, Sun protein localization is shown in red, A-type lamin localization\n(lamin A\/C) is shown in green, and nuclei are revealed in blue using\nH\u00f6chst dye. The inference is that A-type lamins have, at best, a limited role\nin the retention of Sun2 at the NE and no significant role at all in the reten-\ntion of Sun1.\nFigure 6. The retention of nesp2G at the ONM requires the expression of\nSUN domain proteins. (A) Western blot of a HeLa lysate fractionated by SDS-\nPAGE and probed with an affinity-purified antibody raised against the ABD of\nhuman nesp2G identifies a very large (\u0002400 kD) protein. (B) Immunofluores-\ncence microscopy of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells using the anti-ABD an-\ntibody reveals labeling of the cytoplasmic face of the NE. Depletion of nesprin\n2 (all splice isoforms) in HeLa cells by RNAi leads to a loss of ONM labeling in\nthe majority of cells (bottom). These data are consistent with the recognition of\nnesp2G by the anti-ABD antibody. (C) The reduction of either Sun1 or 2 levels\nby RNAi had only a marginal effect on nesp2G localization. However, the\ncombined depletion of both Sun1 and 2 induced a dramatic loss of nesp2G\nfrom the ONM (arrowheads).

To accomplish this, we fused the signal sequence\nand signal peptidase cleavage site of human serum albumin\nonto the NH\n \n2\n \n terminus of HA-Sun1L to yield SS\u2013HA-Sun1L.\nTo prevent its secretion, we fused a KDEL tetrapeptide to the\nCOOH terminus of SS\u2013HA-Sun1L, forming SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013\nKDEL (Fig. 7 A). Synthesis of this chimeric protein in vitro in\nthe presence of microsomes yielded a protein product of the ap-\npropriate size, which was resistant to digestion by proteinase K\n(Fig. 7 B). Clearly, the signal sequence directs HA-Sun1L to\nthe microsome lumen. The shift up in molecular weight of latent\nHA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL is likely a result of NH\n \n2\n \n-linked glycosyla-\ntion (Sun1 has two potential glycosylation sites in its lumenal\ndomain). Upon transfection into HeLa cells, HA-Sun1L\u2013\nKDEL was found to accumulate intracellularly within the\nperipheral ER and PNS. Examination of the distribution of\nnesp2G in transfected cells revealed that it was completely\neliminated from the ONM (Fig. 7 C). EM analysis of these\ncells exposed clear dilation of the ONM and expansion of the\nPNS (Fig. 7 D). This phenotype is indistinguishable from that\nassociated with Sun1\/2 codepletion by RNAi (Fig. 6 F).\nIn further experiments, we took advantage of a cDNA\nencoding a chimeric protein in which GFP is fused to the NH\n \n2\n \nterminus of the nesprin 2 KASH domain (Zhang et al., 2001).\nThis fusion protein localizes to the NE with the GFP exposed\nto the cytoplasm\/nucleoplasm. The KASH domain is integrated\ninto the NE, with its 40-residue COOH-terminal domain resid-\ning within the PNS. We prepared a HeLa cell line harboring\nGFP-KASH under the control of a tetracycline-inducible pro-\nmoter (HeLaTR GFP-KASH). In the absence of tetracycline,\nGFP-KASH is present at low levels and localizes exclusively\nto the NE (Fig. 8 A, \n \n\u0003\n \nTet). After tetracycline induction, large\namounts of GFP-KASH may be observed in both the NE and\nperipheral ER (Fig. 8 A, \n \n\u0004\n \nTet). Introduction of SS\u2013HA-Sun1\u2013\nKDEL into these cells leads to the complete loss of NE-associated\nGFP-KASH. Indeed, all of the GFP-KASH, regardless of ex-\npression level, appears to be recruited into vesicular structures,\npotentially as a prelude to degradation (Fig. 8 B, top; arrows).\nConversely, when full-length Sun1 is introduced into tetracy-\ncline-induced cells, it leads to the recruitment of GFP-KASH\nfrom the peripheral ER to the NE (Fig. 8 B, middle and bottom;\narrows). This is exactly what one would predict if Sun proteins\nfunction as tethers for KASH domain proteins. A similar ef-\nfect was also observed when HA-Sun2 was introduced into the\ntetracycline-induced cells (Fig. 8 C), with GFP-KASH re-\ncruited to and stabilized at the NE. Altogether, these results\ncan only be interpreted in terms of lumenal interactions be-\ntween SUN domain and KASH domain proteins. Furthermore,\nthey suggest that both Sun1 and 2 can interact in vivo with the\nnesprin 2 KASH domain, which is consistent with our RNAi\nresults indicating that both SUN domain proteins contribute to\nnesp2G anchoring.\nTo further define Sun1\/2\u2013KASH interactions, we set out\nto identify Sun\u2013KASH complexes both in vivo and in vitro. For\nthe former, we performed immunoprecipitation analyses of\nSun2. As shown in Fig. 8 E, a high molecular weight protein\nrecognized by our antibody against nesp2G was found to\nFigure 7. A soluble form of the Sun1 lumenal domain causes a loss of nesp2G from the ONM. (A) A signal sequence (SS), HA tag, and KDEL motif were\nadded to the NH2 and COOH termini, respectively, of the Sun1 lumenal domain (SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL). (B) SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL, when translated in vitro in\nthe presence of microsomes, is completely resistant to digestion by proteinase K. If Triton X-100 is included in the digestion reaction to permeabilize the\nmicrosomes, the \u000150-kD SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL translation product (arrow) is completely degraded. These data demonstrate that the signal sequence is fully\nfunctional in directing HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL to the microsomal lumen. (C) When introduced by transfection into HeLa cells, the SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL localizes\nboth to the peripheral ER and to the PNS, which is revealed by immunolabeling with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Cells expressing SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013\nKDEL (red in merged images) exhibit a very obvious loss of nesp2G (green in merged images) from the ONM. (D) Thin section EM of HeLa cells expressing\nSS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL (Transf.) revealed increased separation between the INM and ONM and expansion of the PNS (arrowheads). This effect was not\nobserved in nontransfected cells (NT). The effects of SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL expression were identical to those observed after codepletion of Sun1 and 2 by\nRNAi (Fig. 6).\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\n SUN\u2013NESPRIN INTERACTIONS \u2022 CRISP ET AL.\n \n49\n \ncoimmunoprecipitate with Sun2 from HeLa cell lysates.

Together, all of these data provide strong evidence for\nthe interaction, either direct or indirect, between Sun1\/2 and\nnesp2G. Such an interaction spanning the PNS provides an\nobvious mechanism for the Sun1\/2-dependent tethering of\nnesp2G in the ONM.\n \nDiscussion\n \nWe have shown that Sun1 is an INM protein with an NH\n \n2\n \n-\nterminal nucleoplasmic domain of \n \n\u0001\n \n350 amino acids and a\nlarger COOH-terminal domain of \n \n\u0001\n \n500 amino acids, including\nthe SUN domain, that resides in the PNS. In this way, the to-\npology of Sun1 matches that of another INM protein, Sun2, to\nwhich it is related. Based upon structural predictions, it is\nlikely that Sun1 possesses three closely spaced transmembrane\ndomains between residues 356 and 448. A separate hydropho-\nbic region, H1, that is situated closer to the NH\n \n2\n \n terminus does\nnot appear to function as a membrane anchor. This conclusion\nis based upon the behavior of naturally occurring splice iso-\nforms that lack this hydrophobic sequence. A third mammalian\nSun protein, Sun3, is also an integral membrane protein with a\nlumenal COOH-terminal SUN domain and a relatively small\ncytoplasmic NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal domain (unpublished data). In this\nway, Sun3 conforms to the general topological organization of\nother Sun family members.\nThe organization of the lumenal domains of Sun1 and 2\nbears some comment. The membrane proximal sequences of\nboth proteins are predicted to form a coiled-coil. The implica-\ntion is that these proteins may form homodimers. Given the\nnumber of residues within the Sun1 coiled-coil region, this\ncould potentially project \n \n\u0001\n \n25\u201330 nm into the PNS and would\nterminate in a pair of globular SUN domains. The coiled-coil\nFigure 8. The nesp2G KASH domain interacts with the Sun1 lumenal domain. (A) Fluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells expressing a tetracycline-inducible\nGFP-KASH fusion protein (HeLaTR GFP-KASH). In the absence of tetracycline (\u0003Tet), GFP-KASH is expressed at low levels and is localized exclusively to\nthe NE. After induction with tetracycline for 24 h (\u0004Tet), GFP-KASH is found throughout the peripheral ER as well as the NE. Expression levels of GFP-\nKASH within the cell population is extremely uniform both before and after induction. (B) Transfection of SS\u2013HA-Sun1\u2013KDEL into the HeLaTR GFP-KASH\ncells after tetracycline induction resulted in the complete loss of GFP-KASH from the NE. This was accompanied by the formation of cytoplasmic aggre-\ngates (arrows, top). Conversely, introduction of full-length HA-Sun1 into these cells resulted in the recruitment of GFP-KASH to the NE (arrows, middle and\nbottom). (C) HA-Sun2 was found to have a similar effect (arrows). In the merged images in B and C, GFP-KASH is presented in green, whereas HA-Sun is\nshown in red. (D) To identify an in vitro interaction between KASH and SUN domains, GFP-KASH, SS\u2013HA-Sun1\u2013KDEL, or both proteins were translated in\nreticulocyte lysate containing [35S]methionine\/cysteine in either the presence or absence of microsomes (Totals). Anti-GFP immunoprecipitation of a\nfraction of each sample revealed the pull-down of SS\u2013HA-Sun1\u2013KDEL by GFP-KASH when both proteins were cotranslated in the presence of microsomes\n(arrow). A slightly faster migrating band (asterisk) was detected in the absence of microsomes. However, this band originates in the GFP-KASH translation\nand is unrelated to HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL. Molecular masses are indicated in kD. (E) Immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell lysates with anti-Sun2 antibodies copre-\ncipitates a very large anti-nesp2G immunoreactive protein (arrow). HC indicates the position of immunoglobulin heavy chains. These data suggest a signifi-\ncant interaction between KASH and Sun proteins that must involve their lumenal domains. These findings allow us to propose a model for the LINC complex\n(F) in which nuclear components, including lamins, bind to the INM SUN domain proteins. They, in turn, bind to the KASH domain of the actin-associated\ngiant nesprins on the ONM. Thus, the LINC complex establishes a physical connection between the nucleoskeleton and the cytoskeleton.\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\n JCB \u2022 VOLUME 172 \u2022 NUMBER 1 \u2022 200650\n \ndomain of Sun2 is of a similar size. In both cases, the overall\nconformation of the Sun protein lumenal domain would be that\nof a flower on a stalk, which could potentially bridge the gap\nbetween the lumenal faces of the INM and ONM.\nThe exact mechanism by which Sun1 and 2 are localized\nto the INM has yet to be resolved, although it is likely to in-\nvolve the type of selective retention that has been observed for\nother INM proteins. What is clear is that the lumenal domain of\nboth proteins is entirely dispensable for appropriate localiza-\ntion. This is exactly the reverse of what is observed for nesprin\nproteins (including nesp2G) of the ONM, where the lumenal\nand transmembrane domains (comprising the KASH domain)\nare essential for their retention at the nuclear periphery (Zhang\net al., 2001).\nOn the nucleoplasmic side of the INM, the Sun1 and 2\nNH\n \n2\n \n-terminal domains contain regions of similarity within the\nfirst \n \n\u0001\n \n200 amino acid residues. This common NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal re-\ngion interacts, to a greater or lesser extent, with A-type lamins.\nIn the case of Sun2, there is some evidence that A-type lamins\nmight contribute to Sun2 localization in the INM. However,\nwhether this requires a direct interaction with A-type lamins is\nless clear. Certainly, the concentration of Sun2 in the INM is\nA-type lamin independent in some cells. Furthermore, even in\n \nLmna\n \n-null MEFs in which Sun2 is mislocalized, the mere rein-\ntroduction of A-type lamins fails to recruit Sun2 to the INM, at\nleast within a period of \u000124 h (unpublished data). It seems\nmore likely to us that A-type lamins may have indirect effects\non Sun2, perhaps by altering the accessibility of chromatin pro-\nteins with which Sun2 might interact.\nIn the case of Sun1, there is no evidence that lamins play\nany role in its localization to the INM. However, Sun1 displays\nan extremely robust interaction with prelamin A. Newly syn-\nthesized lamin A undergoes extensive COOH-terminal pro-\ncessing (Sinensky et al., 1994). This involves farnesylation of\nthe COOH-terminal CaaX (single letter code where C is cys-\nteine, a is any amino acid with an aliphatic side chain, and X is\nany amino acid) motif followed by endoproteolysis to remove\nthe aaX residues and carboxy methylation of the farnesyl cys-\nteine. Once incorporated into the nuclear lamina, a second\ncleavage event after Y646 yields mature lamin A (Weber et al.,\n1989). This cleavage of prelamin A at Y646 abolishes any\nstrong interaction with Sun1. Because prelamin A exists only\ntransiently in normal cells, it seems unlikely that its interaction\nwith Sun1 could contribute to Sun1 localization. In our opin-\nion, it is more likely that Sun1 might function in the organiza-\ntion of newly synthesized lamin A within the nuclear lamina.\nThis suggestion is currently under investigation.\nStarr and Han (2002) have shown that the C. elegans\nSUN domain protein Unc-84 is required for the localization of\nAnc-1 in the ONM. They have proposed a model in which the\nlumenal domain of Unc-84, which itself is retained in the INM\nthrough interactions with the single C. elegans lamin, forms a\ncomplex with the lumenal KASH domain of Anc-1. In this\nway, Unc-84 and Anc-1 would provide links in a molecular\nchain that spans the PNS and connects the actin cytoskeleton to\nthe nuclear lamina. Because similar SUN and KASH domain\nmolecules are widely represented in the animal kingdom, we\nattempted to determine whether the Unc-84\/Anc-1 paradigm\nwas applicable in mammalian systems. We used a combination\nof RNAi and a dominant-negative form of Sun1 to test this\nmodel. We found that both Sun1 and 2 contribute to the tether-\ning of nesp2G in the ONM. Elimination of either Sun protein\nby RNAi had little or no effect on nesp2G localization in HeLa\ncells. However, codepletion of Sun1 and 2 leads to the loss of\nnesp2G from the ONM. This was accompanied by separation\nof the ONM and INM, leading to expansion of the PNS. The\nimplication here is that links between the Sun proteins in the\nINM and KASH proteins in the ONM help to maintain the re-\nmarkably regular spacing of the nuclear membranes. This view\nwas reinforced by the findings that overexpression of a soluble\nform of the lumenal domain of Sun1 (SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL)\ninduced essentially the same phenotype: loss of nesp2G from\nthe ONM and expansion of the PNS.\nIn a complementary series of experiments, SS\u2013HA-\nSun1L\u2013KDEL expression was also found to lead to the loss of\nGFP-KASH from the NEs of HeLa cells. This effect can only\nbe accounted for by perturbation of lumenal interactions. Con-\nversely, overexpression of full-length Sun1 (or Sun2) leads to\nthe recruitment of GFP-KASH to the NE. All of these results\nare predictable on the basis of SUN domain proteins function-\ning as translumenal tethers for KASH domain proteins.\nOur final experiments demonstrated the existence of\nSUN\u2013KASH complexes. Immunoprecipitates of Sun2 from\nHeLa extracts were found to contain nesp2G. Similarly, in\nvitro translation of SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL and GFP-KASH\nleads to the formation of HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL\u2013GFP-KASH com-\nplexes provided that microsomes were present in the translation\nmix. While this manuscript was in preparation, Padmakumar et\nal. (2005) published a study that demonstrated a similar inter-\naction between SUN domain and KASH domain proteins.\nTheir results suggest, however, that rather than interacting with\nthe SUN domain itself, the KASH domain actually bound to a\nregion of the polypeptide chain that is proximal to the SUN\ndomain. This region is present in our Sun1L-based dominant-\nnegative mutant.\nAll of our data suggest that the two Sun proteins are the\nkey to the appropriate localization of nesp2G in the ONM. In\ncontrast to previously published findings (Libotte et al., 2005),\nwe could find no evidence of a role for A-type lamins. This is\nnot surprising given that in our HeLa cells, the localization of\nSun1 and 2 appear relatively insensitive to A-type lamin ex-\npression (or depletion). Padmakumar et al. (2005) reached ex-\nactly the same conclusion with respect to Sun1. However, in\nLmna-null MEFs, Sun2 is frequently lost from the NE. Given\nthat expression levels of Sun1 appear to vary somewhat be-\ntween different tissues, it is conceivable that in at least some\ncell types, nesp2G localization to the ONM might be sensitive\nto A-type lamin expression.\nAltogether, our findings and those of Padmakumar et al.\n(2005) are entirely consistent with the model proposed by Starr\nand Han (2003) in which SUN and KASH domain proteins form\na link across the PNS (Fig. 8 F). In addition, in C. elegans, a sim-\nilar mechanism may well operate in the tethering of Zyg-12, a\nNE protein that is required for dynein-mediated centrosome\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\nSUN\u2013NESPRIN INTERACTIONS \u2022 CRISP ET AL. 51\npositioning (Malone et al., 2003). As well as tethering ONM\nproteins, our data would suggest that SUN\u2013KASH linkages\nfurther contribute to the structural integrity of the NE in main-\ntaining the precise separation of the two nuclear membranes.\nFurthermore, given that the giant nesprins are actin-binding pro-\nteins, the SUN\u2013KASH links provide direct molecular connec-\ntions between the actin cytoskeleton and the nuclear interior.\nWe now refer to this molecular chain as the LINC complex.\nMany studies have documented mechanical coupling\nbetween the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Maniotis et al. (1997)\nused microneedle-mediated deformation of the cytoplasm of\ncultured cells to demonstrate mechanical connections between\nintegrins, cytoskeletal filaments, and nucleoplasm. More re-\ncently, Lammerding et al. (2004) were able to show that fibro-\nblasts derived from Lmna-null mouse embryos have impaired\nmechanically activated gene transcription. In related studies,\nBroers et al. (2004) have shown that these same cells exhibited\nreduced mechanical stiffness and perturbations in the organiza-\ntion of the cytoskeleton. The existence of the LINC complex\nprovides a basis for these various observations in that it may\nintegrate the nucleus into a protein matrix that includes the\ncytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and cell\u2013cell adhesion\ncomplexes. This mechanical link not only provides structural\ncontinuity within and between cells, but it also allows for a direct\nphysical signaling pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus,\npotentially facilitating rapid and regionalized gene regulation.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\nHeLa cells and MEFs, both Lmna \u0004\/\u0004 and Lmna \u0003\/\u0003 (Sullivan et al.,\n1999), were maintained in 7.5% CO2 and at 37\u0005C in DME (GIBCO BRL)\nplus 10% FBS (Hyclone), 10% penicillin\/streptomycin (GIBCO BRL), and\n2 mM glutamine.\nAntibodies\nThe following antibodies were used in this study: the monoclonal antibody\nagainst lamins A and C (XB10) has been described previously (Raharjo et\nal., 2001). The monoclonal antibodies 9E10 and 12CA5 against the myc\nand HA epitope tags were obtained from the American Type Culture Col-\nlection and Covance, respectively. Rabbit antibodies against the same\nepitopes were obtained from AbCam. Rabbit antibodies against Sun1\nand 2 were raised against GST fusion proteins as previously described\n(Hodzic et al., 2004). The chicken antibody against the ABD of nesp2G\nwas raised against an ABD-GST fusion protein by Aves Labs, Inc. Affinity\npurification of the IgY was performed in two stages. In the first step, an af-\nfinity column was prepared consisting of GST cross-linked to glutathione\nagarose (Sigma-Aldrich) using 40 mM dimethyl pimelimidate in 0.2 M bo-\nrate buffer, pH 9.0, for 1 h at 4\u0005C. 5 ml IgY solution was passed over this\ncolumn (1-ml bed volume), and the flow through was collected. This flow\nthrough was applied to a second 1-ml column prepared from ABD-GST\nthat was also cross-linked to glutathione agarose. Antibody bound to the\ncolumn was eluted at pH 2.8 in 0.2 M glycine-HCl. The antibody eluate\nwas neutralized with 3 M Tris, pH 8.8, and stored at 4\u0005C with 1 mM so-\ndium azide. Secondary antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor dyes were\nobtained from Invitrogen. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies\nwere obtained from Biosource International.\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\nCells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 3% formaldehyde\n(prepared in PBS from PFA powder) for 10 min followed by a 5-min per-\nmeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were then labeled with\nthe appropriate antibodies plus the DNA-specific H\u00f6chst dye 33258. For\nexperiments involving selective permeabilization, the cells were first fixed\nin 3% formaldehyde. This was followed by permeabilization in 0.003%\ndigitonin in PBS on ice for 15 min (Adam et al., 1990). The cells were\nthen labeled with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. For cer-\ntain double-label experiments, a single primary antibody was applied af-\nter the digitonin permeabilization. After removal of unbound antibody\nwith three PBS washes, the cells were refixed for 5 min (in 3% formalde-\nhyde) and subjected to a further permeabilization step in 0.2% Triton X-100.\nThe second primary antibody was then applied followed by appropriate\nsecondary antibodies. Specimens were observed using a microscope (model\nDMRB; Leica). Images were collected using a CDC camera (CoolSNAP\nHQ; Photometrics) linked to a Macintosh G4 computer running IPLab Spec-\ntrum software (Scanalytics).\nEM\nCells grown in 35-mm petri dishes were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and\n0.2% tannic acid in 200 mM sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room\ntemperature. Postfixation was performed in 2% OsO4 for 20 min. The\ncells were dehydrated in ethanol, lifted from the culture dish using propyl-\nene oxide, and infiltrated with Polybed 812 resin. Polymerization was\nperformed at 60\u0005C for 24 h. Silver-gray sections were cut using an ultrami-\ncrotome (Leica) equipped with a diamond knife. The sections were stained\nwith uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in an electron micro-\nscope (model 7000; Hitachi).\nShort inhibitory RNA (siRNA) methods\nHeLa cells were depleted of Sun1, Sun2, nesprin 2, and lamins using ap-\npropriate SmartPool oligonucleotide duplexes (Dharmacon). Cells were\nexposed to each siRNA in the presence of OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen)\nprecisely as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were subjected to\nsiRNA treatment for periods up to four days. However, most of our analyses\nwere performed after 2\u20133-d treatments.\nImmunoblotting and gel electrophoresis\nCells (siRNA- or mock-treated) grown in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were\nwashed once in PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH\n7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and\n1:1,000 CLAP (10 mg\/ml in DMSO each of chymostatin, leupeptin, anti-\npain, and pepstatin). The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min in an Eppen-\ndorf centrifuge at 4\u0005C. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by the\naddition of TCA to a final concentration of 10%. The precipitate was\nwashed with ethanol\/ether and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.\nProtein samples were fractionated on polyacrylamide gels (7.5, 10, or\n4\u201315% gradient as appropriate; Laemmli, 1970) and transferred onto ni-\ntrocellulose filters (usually BA85; Schleicher and Schuell) using a semidry\nblotting apparatus manufactured by Hoeffer Scientific Instruments Inc. Filters\nwere blocked and labeled with primary antibodies and peroxidase-conju-\ngated secondary antibodies exactly as previously described (Burnette,\n1981). Blots were developed using ECL (GE Healthcare) and exposed to\nX-OMAT film (Kodak) for appropriate periods of time.\nImmunoprecipitations\nFor Sun2\/nesp2G coimmunoprecipitations, three subconfluent 35-mm\ndishes of HeLa cells were each extracted with 1 ml each of PBS containing\n0.1% Triton X-100, 1:1,000 CLAP, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM\n\u0006-glycerophosphate, and 1 mM sodium vanadate. The dishes were rocked\nat 4\u0005C for 15 min, and the cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at max-\nimum speed and at 4\u0005C in a microcentrifuge. The pellets were then reex-\ntracted in a total volume of 3 ml radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for\n15 min, also at 4\u0005C. After centrifugation at 4\u0005C for 10 min, the superna-\ntants were pooled and divided into 500-\u0007l aliquots. Each aliquot was then\nincubated for 14 h at 4\u0005C with appropriate combinations of immune and\npreimmune sera and protein A\u2013Sepharose beads. At the end of this pe-\nriod, the beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three\ntimes in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and once in PBS alone. Finally,\nthe beads were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated to 95\u0005C\nfor 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.\nAll other immunoprecipitations were performed in TNX (50 mM Tris-\nHCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 1:1,000\nCLAP. Incubation with antibodies and protein A\u2013Sepharose beads was for\n1 h at 4\u0005C with continuous gentle mixing. At the end of this period, the\nbeads were collected by brief centrifugation and were washed three times\nin TNX and once in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.

Labeling of transla-\ntion products was accomplished by the inclusion of 10 \u0007Ci 35S Translabel\n(MP Biolabs). Where appropriate, up to 3 \u0007l of canine pancreatic mi-\ncrosomes (Promega) was also included in each reaction. Translation reac-\ntions were assembled on ice before incubation at 30\u0005C for 90 min. At the\nend of this period, translation mixes were further processed for in vitro\nbinding studies (see In vitro pull-down...proteins) or were subjected to diges-\ntion with proteinase K in order to define Sun protein topology. Proteinase\nK digestions were performed on ice for periods of up to 1 h. Each diges-\ntion mix (10-\u0007l total volume) contained 5 \u0007l of the complete in vitro trans-\nlation reaction, 1 \u0007l proteinase K (from a 1-mg\/ml stock solution), 1 \u0007l of\n10\b compensation buffer (containing 0.5 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH\n7.6, and 200 mM potassium acetate), and, where appropriate, 1 \u0007l of a\n10% solution of Triton X-100. Termination of digestion was accomplished\nby the addition of 100 \u0007l of 10% TCA to precipitate the proteins. Precipi-\ntates were washed in ethanol\/ether, air dried, and dissolved in 25 \u0007l\nSDS-PAGE sample buffer by incubation at 37\u0005C.\nPlasmids\nA mouse Sun1 cDNA (IMAGE clone ID 5321879) was obtained from In-\nvitrogen. To generate Sun1 tagged at the NH2 terminus with an HA\nepitope, Sun1 cDNA flanked by 5\tSal1 and 3\tAfl2 restriction sites was\namplified by PCR using primers 5\t-GAACGTCGACTTTTCTCGGCTGCA-\nCACGTACACC-3\t and 5\t-CTGGCTTAAGCTACTGGATGGGCTCTCCG-3\t.\nThe PCR product was digested with Sal1 and Afl2 and inserted down-\nstream of an HA tag sequence in the vector pCDNA3.1(\u0003). This vector\nwas prepared from pcDNA3.1(\u0003) containing HA\u2013lamin A (Raharjo et al.,\n2001) by digestion with Xho1 and Afl2. The resulting plasmid was\npcDNA3.1(\u0003)HA-Sun1.\npcDNA3.1(\u0003)HA-Sun1 was used as a template for generating fur-\nther Sun1 constructs. The Sun1 splice isoform \u00016\u20138 was created by in-\nverse PCR using primers 5\t-CGTGGTTTGAGAGTCCTGTCTCTGG-3\t and\n5\t-GACCTCTTGGTTCAAGCACTGCGAAGG-3\t to amplify the entire plas-\nmid outside of the deleted region. The PCR product was digested with\nthe Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and was circularized by liga-\ntion. A double epitope-tagged Sun1 construct, HA-Sun1\u2013myc, was made\nby PCR using primers 5\t-GCATCTGAAGACCAGCTGAG-3\t and 5\t-\nTAAACTTAAGCTAGAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCCTCAGC-\nCTGGATGGGCTCTCCGTGGACTCG-3\t to insert a 3\t myc tag followed\nby an AflII restriction site. The fragment was then cloned back into the\nHindIII\u2013AflII site of the original template.\nTo prepare a form of EGFP-KASH that could be translated in vitro,\nthe BamHI\u2013Nhe1 digested fragment of pEGFP-KASH was subcloned into\nthe BamHI\u2013Nhe1 site of pCDNA3.1(\u0003) to yield pcDNA3.1EGFP-KASH.\nEGFP-KASH was also inserted into the tetracycline-inducible expression\nvector pcDNA4TO. This was accomplished by amplifying EGFP-KASH by\nPCR using the primers 5\t-TAAACTTAAGCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-\nGAGGAGC-3\t and 5\t-TAAAGCGGCCGCCTATGTGGGGGGTGGC-\nCCATTGGTGTACC-3\t. The 1,003-bp product was cut with Afl2 and Not1\nand was ligated into similarly cut pcDNA4TO.\nThe soluble Sun1 lumenal domain construct SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL,\nwhich was targeted to the ER and PNS, was prepared in three stages. The\nfirst step involved ligation of a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding\nthe entire NH2-terminal signal sequence of human serum albumin, which\nwas ligated into pcDNA3.1(\u0003) between Nhe1 and Apa1 sites to yield\npcDNA3.1SS. In the second intermediate step, the 5\t end of HA\u2013lamin A\nwas amplified by PCR using the pair of primers 5\t-AATTGGGCCCGCT-\nTACCCTTACGATGTACCG-3\t and 5\t-ATATCTTAAGCAGCGCATCCGC-\nCAGCCGGCTC-3\t. The 787-bp PCR product was ligated downstream of\nthe signal sequence in pcDNA3.1SS between the Apa1 and Afl2 sites to\nyield pcDNA3.1SS-HALaA5\t. For the final step, the lamin A sequences\nwere excised using Xho1 and Afl2. To prepare the Sun1 lumenal domain\nsequence incorporating a KDEL motif, PCR was performed using mouse\nSun1 cDNA as a template and using the primers 5\t-AGAGGGTCGAC-\nGATTCCAAGGGCATGCATAG-3\t and 5\t-CTGGCTTAAGCTACAACT-\nCATCTTTCTGGATGGGCTCTCCGTGGAC-3\t. The resultant 1,403-bp\nproduct was cut with Sal1 and Afl2 and was ligated into the Xho1\u2013Afl2\ncut vector. The resulting plasmid was pcDNA3.1SS\u2013HA-Sun1L\u2013KDEL.\nAll enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc.\nTransfections\nPlasmids were introduced into HeLa cells using the Polyfect reagent as de-\nscribed by the manufacturer (QIAGEN). Transfections were normally per-\nformed in six-well plates. In brief, 1.5 \u0007g plasmid DNA was combined\nwith 100 \u0007l of serum-free medium and 12 \u0007l Polyfect. After a 10-min\nroom temperature incubation, this mixture was combined with 600 \u0007l of\ncomplete medium. The entire volume was then placed on the cells with an\nadditional 1.5 ml of complete medium. The cells were then returned to the\ntissue culture incubator for 12\u201324 h. At the end of this period, the cells\nwere processed as appropriate.\nPreparation of GST fusion proteins\nGST-Sun1 and Sun2 fusion proteins were prepared using the plasmids\npGEX-4T3Sun1N220 and pGEX-4T3Sun2NP. These plasmids were cre-\nated by amplifying 5\t sequences of Sun1 and 2 by PCR. The Sun1 PCR\nproduct encoded the first 222 amino acids of the NH2-terminal domain,\nwhereas the Sun2 sequences encoded the bulk of NH2-terminal domain of\n165 amino acids. These PCR products were inserted into pGEX4T3 (GE\nHealthcare) between BamHI and EcoRI sites. The primers used for Sun1\nwere 5\t-CGCGGATCCGACTTTTCTCGGCTGCAC-3\t and 5\t-CCGGAAT-\nTCTTAGCGTGGTTTGAGAGTCCT-3\t, whereas the Sun2 primer pair con-\nsisted of 5\t-CGCGGATCCTCCCCGAAGAAGCCAGCGCCTCACG-3\t\nand 5\t-CCGGAATTCTTAGGAGCCCGCCCGTGAGACGGC-3\t. A single\ncolony of Bl-21 cells transformed with either plasmid was grown overnight\nin 10 ml Luria-Bertani containing 100 \u0007g\/ml ampicillin and was induced\nwith 0.1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 37\u0005C. The cells were harvested by 15-min\ncentrifugation at 4\u0005C and at 3,200 g in an Eppendorf table-top centrifuge.\nThe bacterial pellets were resuspended by trituration in 1 ml of lysis buffer\nconsisting of STE (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA)\ncontaining 5 mM DTT and 0.25% sarkosyl (N-laurylsarcosine). The sus-\npension was sonicated to achieve maximum cell breakage and was centri-\nfuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4\u0005C. The su-\npernatant was then transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube containing\n30 \u0007l of a 50% suspension in PBS of swollen glutathione agarose beads.\nThe cleared bacterial lysate and beads were then incubated with continu-\nous mixing at 4\u0005C for 1 h. At the end of this period, the beads were\nwashed three to five times with ice-cold STE and twice with ice-cold bind-\ning buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and\n1 mM DTT).\nIn vitro pull-down with GST fusion proteins\n1.5 \u0007g of plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1HA\u2013lamin A, \u2013mature lamin A, \u2013lamin\nB1, and \u2013lamin C) was included in 25 \u0007l TNT-coupled transcription\/transla-\ntion mixes containing 10 \u0007Ci 35S Translabel and incubated at 30\u0005C for 90\nmin. 1 ul of each reaction was retained for the analysis of total translation\nproducts, whereas the remainder was incubated with 10 ul GST\u2013agarose\nbeads in 600 \u0007l of binding buffer (containing 10 \u0007g\/ml chymostatin, leu-\npeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and 1 mM PMSF) for 30 min at room tempera-\nture with constant mixing. After a low speed centrifugation at 800 g, the\nsupernatant was split into three tubes containing 5 ul GST\u2013agarose, GST-\nSun1N220, or GST-Sun2NP beads. The suspensions were then incubated\nfor 45 min at room temperature with constant mixing. Finally, the beads\nwere washed three to five times with binding buffer containing 1 mM DTT.\nAfter the final wash, the binding buffer was replaced with 20 \u0007l SDS-PAGE\nsample buffer. The samples were subsequently fractionated by SDS-PAGE.\nThe gels were stained with Coomassie blue R-250, impregnated with\nAmplify (GE Healthcare), dried, and exposed to X-OMAT film (Kodak).\nNorthern blot analysis\nDouble-stranded DNA probes consisting of the 5\t (650 bp) and 3\t (860\nbp) fragments of mSun1 and the full-length human Sun3 (1,050 bp) were\ngenerated by PCR. Incorporation of [32P]dCTP into the PCR products was\naccomplished by random priming using the Rediprime II Random Primer\nLabeling System (GE Healthcare) using 15 ng (in 45 \u0007l Tris-EDTA buffer)\ndenatured DNA. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (BLOT-2; Sigma-\nAldrich) containing 2 ug polyA\u0004 (per lane) RNA isolated from 10 differ-\nent mouse organs (brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, testis, lung, thymus,\nplacenta, and skeletal muscle tissues of BALB\/c mice) was hybridized in-\ndependently with each of the prepared probes, including one against\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1.4 ng\/ml in 6 ml\nPerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer) for 17 h (Sigma-Aldrich). Between\neach hybridization, the blot was stripped of the probe according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nWe would like to acknowledge Manfred Lohka, Colin Stewart, and Phyllis\nHansen for valuable discussions.\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of\nHealth to B. Burke and P.D. Stahl. D. Hodzic was supported by a fellowship\nfrom the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\nSubmitted: 20 September 2005\nAccepted: 22 November 2005\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published December 27, 2005\nSUN\u2013NESPRIN INTERACTIONS \u2022 CRISP ET AL. 53\nReferences\nAdam, S.A., R.E.
