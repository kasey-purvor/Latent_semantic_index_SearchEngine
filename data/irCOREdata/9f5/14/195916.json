This was associated with the \npresence of malformed nodes of Ranvier characterized by an accumulation of \naxoplasmic vesicles under the nodal membrane. The data are consistent with the \npresence of a vesicular signalling pathway between axons and glial cells that is essential \nfor proper development of the node of Ranvier. \n \n3 \nIntroduction \nMyelinated axons are responsible for the rapid transmission of action potentials \naround the nervous system. A high conduction velocity of axons is achieved by \nrestricting the generation of action potentials to nodes of Ranvier that are spaced at \nregular intervals along the axon, separated by stretches of insulating myelin laid down \nby oligodendrocytes. Formation of the node of Ranvier involves clustering of the Na+ \nchannels responsible for action potential generation at node sites as myelin is deposited \nalong the inter-nodal region (Rasband & Shrager, 2000; Girault & Peles, 2002; Salzer, \n2003). Na+ channel clustering is preceded by the clustering of several components of a \nNa+ channel-cytoskeletal complex, including ankyrin G and \u03b2 IV spectrin (Lambert et \nal., 1997; Rasband et al., 1999; Jenkins & Bennett, 2002). Mediators of axon-glial \ninteraction such as CASPR-1 also form clusters at early node sites before Na+ channels \nstart to aggregate (Rasband et al., 1999), and the whole process is apparently dependent \nupon a soluble factor released by oligodendrocytes (Kaplan et al., 1997). It is currently \nunclear what determines where nodes will form or how the aggregation of the \ncomponents of the node is controlled.  \nIntracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) regulates the outgrowth of axons (Henley & Poo, 2004; \nConklin et al., 2005) and the formation of neuronal structures such as dendrites (Konur \n& Ghosh, 2005). Localized [Ca2+]i changes could also potentially coordinate the \ndevelopment of the node of Ranvier. Local Ca2+ changes could be produced by focal \nexpression of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels along axons (Mackenzie et al., 1996; Forti et \nal., 2000). Ca2+ channels are heteromeric membrane proteins that play an important role \nin the regulation of numerous cellular processes and are classified according to their \nelectrophysiological and pharmacological properties (L-, N-, P\/Q-, R-, and T-type). \nEach Ca2+ channel type is composed of a pore-forming \u03b11 subunit and a number of \naccessory subunits. It is the \u03b11 subunit that distinguishes Ca2+ channel subtype and there \nare currently 10 \u03b11 subunit genes known (Catterall, 2000). The \u03b11 subunit contains the \nelements responsible for voltage dependent gating of the channels, which may be \nmodulated by accessory subunits.  \n4 \nWhile the axons of mammalian neurons possess several proteins involved in Ca2+ \nhomeostasis, evidence for the expression of functional Ca2+ channels on the axolemma \nhas been slow to reveal itself. Past reports in the literature have suggested that axonal \nCa2+ channels may, under physiological circumstances, play a part in the regulation of \naction potential frequency and the non-vesicular release of neurotransmitter substances \nat en passant synapses (Callewaert et al., 1996; Forti et al., 2000). More recently, \nvesicular release of glutamate has been demonstrated in both the corpus callosum and \nimmature rat optic nerve (Kukley et al., 2007; Ziskin et al., 2007). Both studies \nindependently reported activity dependent activation of AMPA receptors on NG2(+) \ncells following vesicular glutamate release, predominantly from unmyelinated axons. \nKuckley et al. (2007) provided evidence that this synapse-like form of axon-glia \ncommunication was initiated by rapid Ca2+ signalling within Ca2+ micro-domains in \naxons. Here we provide evidence that clustered axonal Ca2+ channels play a significant \nrole in action potential conduction in neonatal central axons and make a pivotal \ncontribution to the development of the node of Ranvier. The Ca2+ channels involved are \nlargely of the synaptic P\/Q type and we provide additional evidence that they are \ninvolved in co-ordinating the fusion of vesicular elements from the axoplasm to the \naxolemma of developing axons. \nMethods \nEthical approval \n All animal procedures were approved by local ethical review and conformed to \nUK home office regulations. Animals were killed by vertebral dislocation or CO2 \ninhalation depending upon age. \n \nGeneral \nOptic nerves were dissected from Lister-hooded rats and perfused with artificial \ncerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), composition (in mM): NaCl, 126; KCl, 3; NaH2PO4, 2; \nMgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; NaHCO3, 26; glucose, 10; pH, 7.45, bubbled with 5% CO2 \/ 95% \nO2 and maintained at 37oC. Bicarbonate, sulphates and phosphates were omitted from \nthe high divalent cation solutions used to evoke divalent cation action potentials \n5 \n(osmolarity maintained with sucrose). These solutions contained 10 mM Hepes and \nwere buffered to pH 7.45. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM, significance determined by ANOVA \nwith Tukey\u2019s post-test. Unless otherwise stated all chemicals were purchased from \nSigma (UK). \n \nElectrophysiology \n Extracellular compound action potentials were evoked and recorded with suction \nelectrodes. Peak-to-peak amplitude was used to assess changes in the number of unitary \naction potentials in the neonate since action potential area can not be applied reliably to \nrecordings from neonatal nerves. This is due to the large stimulus artifact produced by \nthe longer stimulus times that are required to elicited a full neonatal compound action \npotential (Foster et al., 1982; Fern et al., 1998).  \n Nerves were maintained in an interface perfusion chamber (Medical Systems, \nGreenvale, New York, USA), and continuously oxygenated with 5% CO2 \/ 95% O2. \nIndividual nerves were electrically stimulated via a suction electrode at one end using \nsquare-wave constant current pulses of 150-600 \u00b5sec (<P15) or 50 \u00b5sec (>P15) duration \n(Iso stim A320, WPI), and compound action potentials recorded via a second suction \nelectrode at the other end (Cyber Amp 320, Axon Instruments). The recorded signal was \nsubtracted from a parallel differential electrode, filtered (low pass: 800-10000 Hz, \ndepending upon animal age), digitized (25000 Hz: 1401 mini, Cambridge Electronic \nDesign) and displayed on a PC running Signal software (Cambridge Electronic Design) \nwith positive (relative to the subtraction electrode) going up. Lower filter settings were \nused for neonatal nerves to prevent distortion of the wave form due to the slow time-\ncourse of the wave compared to those recorded from adult nerves. \n \nImmuno-histochemistry \nOptic nerves were dissected into 0.1M PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde \nfor 30 min. The optic nerves were subsequently incubated in 0.1M PBS plus 20% \nsucrose w\/v for 5 min prior to freeze-sectioning (20 \u00b5m sections) and subsequent \nblocking for 60 min in 0.1M PBS, 10% fetal goat serum plus 0.5% Triton-X 100. \nSections were then incubated in this solution plus primary antibody at 4o C overnight. \n6 \nPrimary antibodies included: polyclonal \u03b11A (Alomone; 1:200), \u03b11B, \u03b11C, \u03b11D, (Sigma; \n1:200), and affinity purified \u03b12\u03b4-2\uf020(Brodbeck et al., 2002: 1:200). In double-staining \nexperiments, second primary incubations were at room temperature for two hours: \nmonoclonal anti-pan-Na+ channel (Sigma; 1:200), anti-neurofilament-70 (NF-70) or \nanti-neurofilament-200 (NF-200) (Chemicon; 1:100 and 1:200 respectively), anti-GFAP \n(Sigma; 1:500), anti-CNPase (Sigma; 1:100), or anti-CASPR-1 (1:1000) were used. The \naxonal markers NF-70 and NF-200 tend to label small diameter and larger diameter \naxons respectively (Sanchez et al., 2000). Appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary \nantibodies (Cambridge Bioscience; 1:1000) were subsequently applied for 1 hour and \nsections examined by scanning confocal microscopy using an Olympus FV300 \nFluoview confocal image system.  \nImages were analyzed using either Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corporation) \nor image J (NIH). Images of Na+ and Ca2+ channel clusters were analyzed using Image J \nusing the Cell Counter plug-in. Random single optical section fields of view (FOV) \nwere taken from a minimum of three nerves with no more than three FOVs being taken \nfrom a single nerve, resulting in a sample number of at least nine. When such analysis \nwas done using two or more different ages, or with either leaner or ducky mice and their \nrespective controls, the individual performing the analysis (J.J.P.A.) was blinded to the \nimages in order to avoid any potential bias. The degree to which Ca2+ channel clusters \nco-localized with cell-specific markers was assessed by counting the number of times \nthe Ca2+ channel clusters either did, or did not, completely overlap with the marker \nwithin a field of view. The degree of co-localization was then reported as a percentage \nof the total number of Ca2+ channel clusters within the FOV. The degree of association \nof Ca2+ channel clusters with the paranodal marker CASPR-1 was assessed by \nobserving the number of times clusters within a FOV either were co-localized (defined \nas complete overlap) or were immediately adjacent (defined as touching or partial \noverlap) to CASPR-1 immunoreactivity. The degree of association between these two \nmarkers is taken to be the degree of adjacent and co-localized markers combined. \nFinally, neurofilament intensity was calculated using Metamorph software. \n \nElectron-microscopy \n7 \nOptic nerves from P23-25 mice and P10 rats were post-fixed in 3% \ngluteraldehyde in Sorenson's phosphate buffer. Nerves from Leaner mice were obtained \nfrom Jackson Laboratories (Main, USA) and were fixed according to our instruction. \nNerves were then post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated prior to \ninfiltration in epoxy. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate \nand examined with a Jeol 100CX electron microscope, see (Thomas et al., 2004) for \nfurther details. For post-embedding immuno-labelling, primary antibody was applied to \nthe sections overnight. Antibodies raised against: \u03b11A (Alomone; 1:200), SNAP-25 \n(Sigma; 1:50), V-ATPase (Santa Cruz Biochem; 1:50), glutamate (Chemicon \nInternational; 1:25-1:50) were used and appropriate 20-30 nm gold particle secondary \nantibodies were applied following washing. Controls involved omitting primary \nantibodies, which resulted in zero staining. The anti-SNAP-25 antibody was used at the \nsame concentration by Kolk et al., (2000), who demonstrate a synaptic pattern of \nstaining in CNS grey matter, in addition to a lower level of axonal staining. The anti-\nglutamate antibody has been described in prior publications (e.g., Back et al., 2006), \nwhere a range of controls are described. \n \nResults \nFunctional voltage-gated calcium channels on neonatal central axons \n To probe for the presence of functional Ca2+ channels on developing axons we \ndetermined whether the axons can support a divalent cation-mediated compound action \npotential (DCAP) (Fatt & Ginsborg, 1958). Na+ channels were blocked by perfusion \nwith zero-Na+ aCSF + 1 \u00b5M TTX, abolishing the normal action potential (Fig 1 a-c). \nSubsequently increasing the extracellular divalent cation concentration to 40 mM of \nboth Ca2+ and Ba2+ (total divalent cation concentration = 80 mM) to potentiate current \nthrough Ca2+ channels produced an action potential from P2 to P12, but not at P22 (Fig \n1 a-c). Between 10-20 min of perfusion with high concentrations of divalent cation \nsolution was required before a DCAP appeared, consistent with the slow diffusion of the \nions into the extracellular space (Fern & Harrison, 1988). The DCAP recorded from the \nneonatal optic nerve was similar to the Na+ action potential in amplitude but was \n8 \nrelatively slower conducting (0.1-0.3 m\/sec compared to 1-3 m\/sec). Slow action \npotential conduction will be partly due to differences in channel kinetics between Ca2+-\nchannels and Na+-channels and partly to the surface negative charge screening effects of \nthe divalent ions. High concentrations of Ca2+ and Ba2+ will increase the screening of \nfixed negative charge on the extracellular surface of the axon, effectively raising the \nactivation threshold of voltage-gated channels (Brismar & Frankenhaeuser, 1972; Hille, \n1998). Removal of extracellular Na+ will produce a degree of membrane depolarization \nthat will partially counter this effect, while rapid depletion of axoplasmic Na+ will block \nany effect of Na-Ca exchange (NCX) upon membrane potential or ion fluxes (Stys et \nal., 1992; Leppanen & Stys, 1997). Although relatively slow, the rate of DCAP \nconduction precludes the possibility that the potential is conducted down glial cells in \nthe optic nerve as a form of spreading depression. Spreading depression propagates at \nthree to four orders of magnitude more slowly than the DCAP (between 30-50 \u00b5\/sec), \ntravels only relatively short distances from a point stimulation (~500 \u00b5m), lasts over \nfour orders of magnitude longer (~100 seconds), and does not operate in central white \nmatter (e.g. Peters et al., 2003; Fabricius et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2006). A contribution \nfrom divalent cations passing through TTX-resistant Na+ channels can also be \ndiscounted since the Ca2+-permeability of Na+ channels is low, high Ca2+ concentrations \nblock Na+ channels (Hille, 1998; Armstrong & Cota, 1999), and the TTX-insensitive \nNa+ channels in the axons are not capable of supporting an action potential (TTX \ncompletely bocks the normal Na+ action potential). Furthermore, robust DCAPs were \nobserved when Ba2+ alone was used as the charge carrier (see below), while Ba2+-\npermeability through Na+ channels is not measurable (Hille, 1998).  \n The Ca2+-channel-dependent nature of the DCAP was confirmed by application \nof selective Ca2+-channel blockers. The DCAP was blocked at P8-12 by the broad-\nspectrum Ca2+ channel blocker La3+ (100 \u00b5M) (Fig 1 g). The selective L-type Ca2+ \nchannel blocker diltiazem (50 \u00b5M) largely blocked the divalent cation action potential \nat P2-5, but not at P8-12 (Fig 1 d, e, g). The P8-12 divalent cation action potential was \nlargely blocked by the specific P\/Q blocker \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA (Mintz et al., 1992) (100 \nnM) (Fig 1 f, g). \n \n Figure 1 near here \n9 \n \n Perfusion with either divalent cation alone produced a DCAP (Fig 2 a-c). Once \napparent, the DCAP declined over ~20 min period, irrespective of whether it was Ba2+ \nor Ca2+ in the divalent cation solution (Fig 2 a-c), or both (Fig 1 b, c, Fig 2 e). This \neffect may be due to the run-down of concentration gradients in the small diameter, \nsmall volume, neonatal RON axons. Axons will lack Na-Ca exchange under these zero \nNa+-conditions (Stys et al., 1992; Leppanen & Stys, 1997), and divalent ions entering \nduring an action potential are likely to remain in the axoplasm. The diameter of axons in \nthe P8-12 RON ranges between ~0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5m (Foster et al., 1982). The effect of a \nsingle 100 mV DCAP upon the divalent-cation reversal potential can be calculated \nusing the equation n=CV\/2F where \"n\" is the number of divalent ions entering the axon \nduring one action potential (in moles), \"C\" is the membrane capacitance (1 \u00b5F\/cm2), \n\"V\" is the action potential amplitude, and \"F\" is the Faraday constant. The DCAP \namplitude is estimated at 100 mV since intra-axonal recording from optic nerve axons \nhave never been achieved. The number of divalent cations within the resting axoplasm \ncan be calculated from the cylinder volume and resting ion concentration, while the \nnumber of ions entering a given length of axon during a single action potential can be \ncalculated from the voltage change across the membrane capacitance (Aidley 1971). \nAssuming a resting axoplasmic divalent concentration of 100 nM, a single DCAP is \npredicted to result in a 20.2 \u00b5M rise in axoplasmic divalent cation concentration, \nproducing a sharp decline in the divalent-cation reversal potential (Fig 2 d). The time-\ncourse of the DCAP was not significantly different in solutions with various divalent \nconcentrations (Fig 2 e). However, the axoplasmic divalent cation concentration \nprimarily determines the divalent cation reversal potential and these changes in \nextracellular divalent ion concentration are predicted to have only a small effect upon \nDCAP survival time (Fig 2 d). While this calculation are consistent with a collapse of \ndivalent ion influx during repetitive stimulation, the associated rise in axoplasmic ion \ndivalent cation concentration may have other effects upon action potential conduction \nthat might contribute to the relatively rapid conduction failure.  \n \n Figure 2 near here \n10 \nCalcium channel activation during action potential conduction \n We examined the possibility that the calcium channels expressed by developing \ncentral axons might contribute to normal action potential conduction. Compound action \npotentials recorded from neonatal rat optic nerves were stable under control conditions \nof perfusion with normal aCSF (Fig 3 a), and exhibited a reversible fall in amplitude at \nP2-P5 (Fig 3 d, f) and P8-12 (Fig 3 b, e, f) upon perfusion with the broad-spectrum \ncalcium channel blocker La3+ (100 \u00b5M). This effect of La3+ was lost by P20 (Fig 3 f). \nThe selective L-type calcium channel blocker diltiazem (50 \u00b5M) mimicked the effect of \nLa3+ upon compound action potential amplitude at P2-5 but not at later developmental \nstages (Fig 3 c-f). Diltiazem did slow action potential conduction at P8-12 however (Fig \n3 c), but had no comparable effect in P18-25 optic nerves (data not shown). A similar \npartial conduction block was produced by nifedepine (5 \u00b5M) at P2, reducing amplitude \nby 44.5% \u00b1 12.8% (n=3, data not shown). Nifedepine is not the L-type channel blocker \nof choice in this preparation, however (Fern et al 1995). Block of P\/Q-type channels \nwith \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA (100 nM) at P8-12 produced a significant fall in action potential \namplitude, a result also obtained with the N- and P\/Q \u2013type blocker \u03c9-conotoxin \nMVIIC (1 \u00b5M) (Fig 3 g, i , j). In contrast, specific block of N-type channels with \u03c9-\nconotoxin GVIA (1 \u00b5M) had no effect (Fig 3 h-j). These data suggest that L-type \ncalcium channels contribute to normal action potential conduction at P2-P5 (prior to the \nappearance of compact myelin in this preparation), that P\/Q-type channels have a \nsimilar affect at P10 (when myelination is getting underway), and that no significant \ncontribution to action potential amplitude from calcium channels is apparent at P18-\nP25. \nFigure 3 near here. \n \nSynaptic-type calcium channels are clustered on developing central axons \nWe examined the expression of various calcium channel \u03b11 subunits in \ndeveloping white matter and detected a clustered expression patern of \u03b11A (P\/Q-type: \n11 \nFig 4 a, b; Fig 5 a) and \u03b11C (L-type: Fig 4 a; Fig 5 b) subunits (\u03b11B and \u03b11D were not \ndetected, data not shown). While \u03b11C clusters were present at a relatively stable level \nbetween P2-P20, \u03b11A clusters were almost absent at P2, reached a maximum at P12 and \ndeclined by P20 (Fig 4 a; Fig 5 a, b). Calcium channel clusters were co-localized with \nsmall NF-70(+) axons (Fig 4 b), and were less numerous on larger NF-200(+) axons \n(data not shown). Small diameter developing axons are close-packed and as a result \nsingle NF-70(+) axons are difficult to resolve at the light level. To test whether overlap \nof the \u03b11A clusters with the NF-70 immuno-staining was significant rather than a \nrandom event, we blind-counted the extent of \u03b11A \/ NF-70 overlap in normal images and \nin images with the \u03b11A rotated by 90 degrees, revealing 63.4\u00b15.1% (n=8) co-localization \nin rotated compared to 87.1\u00b12.6% (n=9, P<0.001) in the non-rotated images (Fig 4 d). \nSimilar levels of co-localization were detected for \u03b11C\/ NF-70 (P<0.001, Fig 4 e). Little \nco-localization was apparent between either \u03b11A or \u03b11C and the glial markers CNPase \n(Fig 4 c) or GFAP (Supplemental Fig 1 e-g), and no significant difference was found in \nthe degree of overlap between normal and rotated images (P>0.05 in all cases, \nSupplemental Fig 1 h, i). In control experiments, \u03b11A clusters were abolished by pre-\nincubating the antibody with a blocking peptide, or by omitting the primary antibody \nduring co-labelling experiments (Supplemental Fig 1 b-d). Confirmation of the clustered \n\u03b11A staining of axons was obtained using a second \u03b11A antibody from a different source \n(Sigma UK, data not shown). \nFigure 4 + 5 near here. \n \nThe antibody staining indicated that Ca2+ channels appear in clusters on central \naxons before Na+ channel clusters first appear (Fig 4 a; Fig 5 a, b). We therefore co-\nstained for \u03b11A and \u03b11C subunits and CASPR-1, an early component of the node of \nRanvier (Rasband & Shrager, 2000). \u03b11A clusters were co-localized with 12.2 \u00b10.5% of \nCASPR-1 clusters and were contiguous with a further 43.5 \u00b10.8% (16 fields of view, 5 \nnerves) at P9 (Fig 5 c, e). By P12, 22.2 \u00b11.6% of \u03b11A clusters were co-localized with \nCASPR-1 clusters and 35.2 \u00b11.7% were contiguous (12 fields of view, 4 nerves) (Fig 5 \n12 \nc, e). A similar pattern of expression was seen for clusters of \u03b11C subunits (Fig 5 d, e). In \nall cases, the degree of association was significantly greater than that found in rotated \ncontrols (P<0.001, Fig 5 e). In contrast to CASPR-1, only 22.5 \u00b13.3% of Na+ channel \nclusters were associated (overlap + contiguous) with \u03b11A clusters at P12 (4 fields of \nview, 4 nerves) with very little actual overlap (2.8%). \u03b11A clusters therefore appear \nseveral days before Na+ channel clusters are evident at sites on central axons where \nnodes are forming, and disperse once Na+ channel clusters appear. \n \n\u03b11A subunits are localized to the axolemma \nAt the ultrastructural level, white matter \u03b11A protein was largely restricted to the \naxolemma and axoplasm of developing axons. Immuno-gold particles were particularly \ncommon at zones where glial processes were making contact with axons (Fig 6), areas \nthat were also rich in sites where vesiculotubular complex appeared to be fusing or \napproaching the axolemma. Blinded counting of all the gold particles within 8 randomly \nselected whole grid sections revealed that 69.0% of the axolemma particles were located \nat sites where vesicular fusion was occurring, defined as regions where axoplasmic \nvesicles or tubules were closely associated with the axolemma (n=54 gold particles in \ntotal). The mean distance to the nearest fusion zone for the remaining 31.0% of particles \nwas 0.42 \u00b5m. Analysis revealed that 30.9 \u00b12.8% of axolemma area was associated with \nvesicle fusion sites at P 8-12 (47 axons examined in the same 8 grid sections), and the \nhigh co-incidence of \u03b11A particles and vesiculotubular complex fusion sites is not due to \nchance alone (P<0.001). 93.0% of the particles that were located at or near fusion sites \nwere found at points where glial cell processes were directly apposed to the axolemma. \nIn 37.0% of these cases the glial process was myelinating the axon, and the remaining \n63.0% of the peri-axonal glial processes were either non-myelinating oligodendrocyte \nor astrocyte processes, which are often hard to differentiate.  \nVesiculotubular complex is a poorly defined but significant component of \ndeveloping central axons (Hildebrand & Waxman, 1984), and probably contains \n13 \nelements of tubulovesicular organelles transported from the somata (Nakata et al., \n1998), in addition to \"axoplasmic reticulum\" (Lindsey & Ellisman, 1985), but it is \nprobably not limited to these. The vesiculotubular complex is thought to be involved in \ntrafficking of components to the axolemma during axonal diameter expansion, and is \nless apparent in mature axons (Hildebrand & Waxman, 1984). An analysis of axons in \nthe P8-12 optic nerve revealed that prior to the initiation of glial contact 20.3 \u00b14.0% \n(n=13 axons) of the axolemma was associated with apparent vesiculotubular complex \nfusion sites. This proportion significantly increased to 31.5 \u00b14.2% in more mature axons \nthat had glial processes aligned along the axolemma (n= 15, P<0.001), and to 38.0 \n\u00b14.5% in axons with layers of compact myelin (n= 19, P<0.001). By P20 the proportion \nof the axolemma exhibiting fusion sites in myelinated axons fell to 23.1 \u00b13.1%, which \nwas significantly lower than that in myelinating P8-12 axons (n= 32, P<0.001), \nconfirming the relationship between the onset of myelination, axon diameter expansion \nand fusion of the vesiculotubular complex to the axolemma. Tubular elements of this \nstructure can range in diameter between 20-40 nm and measure up to 25 \u00b5m in length, \nmaking them difficult to distinguish from microtubules. Vesicular elements can range \nbetween tens to several hundreds of nm across (e.g., Fig 6 and Supplemental Fig 2), and \nin the current study we found that both vesicular and tubular elements appear to fuse to \nthe axolemma in places (Fig 6). \nFigure 6 near here. \nSince the \u03b11A protein is located at regions where vesiculotubular complex \nelements are fusing with the axolemma, we probed for other components of synaptic \nvesicle targeting in developing central axons. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we \nfound SNAP-25 expression in a similar pattern to \u03b11A (Fig 7 a, b), with 71.2% of gold \nparticles located on the interior axolemma surface (25% on vesiculotubular complex, \n3.8% in the cytoplasm; 49 micrograph fields analyzed). In contrast, expression of the \nvesicular ATPase (V-ATPase) was a mirror image of this pattern (Fig 7 c-e) with 75.8 \n% present in the vesiculotubular complex (12% on the interior axolemma, 10.5% in the \ncytoplasm; 54 micrograph fields). V-ATPase is involved in glutamate loading of \nsynaptic vesicles and glutamate was found to be concentrated in the vesiculotubular \n14 \ncomplex (Fig 7 f, g), including within vesiculotubular complex elements fusing with the \naxolemma (Fig 7 g). Vesiculotubular complex was highlighted in micrographs by \nintensity thresholding, revealing that 33.1% of the axoplasmic area was taken up by \nvesiculotubular complex measured in this way (which does not effectively exclude all \nthe microtubules; 49 micrograph fields). 94.4% of gold particles in glutamate immuno-\nlabelled sections were in direct contact with vesiculotubular complex highlighted in this \nfashion, consistent with significant glutamate enrichment in the vesiculotubular \ncomplex. Glutamate reactivity was also detected in glial somata and in their primary \nprocesses close to the somata (not shown), but glutamate staining was infrequent in glial \nprocesses neighbouring developing axons and glutamate was not seen in vesicular \nstructures in any other cellular compartment within white matter other than the \nvesiculotubular complex. SNAP-25, V-ATPase and glutamate gold-labelling of this \ntype was seen in small diameter yet to be myelinated axons through to large diameter \naxons with multiple myelin wraps (e.g., SNAP-25 staining in Fig 7 a, b).  \nFigure 7 near here \n \nCalcium channel mutants have disrupted nodes of Ranvier \nAs P\/Q-type channels were the most abundant channel subtype in developing \noptic nerve axons and were maximally expressed at a crucial point in maturation we \nsought evidence of their potential role from two mice strains carrying mutations \naffecting P\/Q-type VGCCs. Ducky (du) and ducky-2J (du2J) mice carry functionally \nnull mutations in the Cacna2d2 gene encoding the \u03b12\u03b4-2 calcium channel subunit, \nresulting in reduced P\/Q currents in cells expressing these subunits (Barclay et al., 2001; \nBrodbeck et al., 2002). Expression of \u03b12\u03b4-2 was examined in P12 rat optic nerve and \nshowed a similar clustered expression on NF-70(+) axons to that seen for the \u03b11A and \n\u03b11C subunits (Fig 8 a). The \u03b12\u03b4-2 clusters also had a similar association with CASPR-1 \nto that seen for \u03b11A clusters at P9 and P12 in the rat (Fig 8 b). 41.9 \u00b1 0.4% (n=10) of \nCASPR-1 clusters were associated with \u03b12\u03b4-2 clusters at P9 and 51.2 \u00b12.6% (n=9) of \n15 \nCASPR-1 clusters were associated with \u03b12\u03b4-2 clusters at P12. Similar clustered \nexpression of \u03b11A and \u03b12\u03b4-2 was also common in NF-70(+) +\/+ mouse optic nerve \naxons (Fig 8 c), while the number of \u03b11A clusters was significantly reduced in du2J\/du2J \noptic nerve compared to their +\/+ littermates (P<0.01, Fig 8 d). As the \u03b12\u03b4-2 subunit is \nthought mainly to enhance \u03b11A expression with only minor effects on gating, this down-\nregulation of \u03b11A clusters in du2J\/du2J is in line with the ~30% loss of P\/Q conductance \nin Purkinje cells of both du\/du (Barclay et al., 2001; Brodbeck et al., 2002) and in \ndu2J\/du2J (Donato et al., 2006).  \nFigure 8 near here \nSince \u03b11A clusters were reduced in du2J\/du2J we examined the morphology of the \noptic nerve nodes of Ranvier in these animals at ~P25. No obvious differences were \nfound in cross-sections of control +\/+ littermates and du2J\/du2J (not shown), and the +\/+ \nanimals displayed normal nodal morphology for this point in development when \nexamined in long section, with end-loops of the myelinating sheath framing a clear \nnodal gap (Fig 9 a, n=43 nodes examined). In contrast, the nodes of Ranvier of du2J\/du2J \nanimals (n= 42 nodes examined) had a significantly extended nodal length (Fig 9 d, \n1.07 \u00b10.05 \u00b5m in wild-type vs. 1.2 \u00b10.05 \u00b5m in du2J\/du2J, p<0.05), and a significantly \nexpanded nodal width, as determined by measuring the diameter of the node versus the \ndiameter of the paranode to account for differences in axon size (Fig 9 e, 111 \u00b14% in \nwild-type vs. 139 \u00b15% in du2J\/du2J, p<0.001). No significant difference in axon or fiber \ndiameter were found between +\/+ and du2J\/du2J, however, a significant decrease in the \n\"g\" value (axon diameter\/fiber diameter) was found (0.79 \u00b10.005, n=70, in wild-type vs. \n0.76 \u00b10.006 in du2J\/du2J, n=119, p<0.01). The aberrant nodes of the du2J\/du2J animals \ntypically contained large vesicular inclusions under the nodal membrane  (Fig 9 b, c), \nwhile the remaining nodes exhibited a range of malformations from swelling of the \nnodal membrane to the presence of vacuoles and other inclusions within the nodal \naxoplasm. \nFigure 9 near here \n16 \n We also examined node morphology in the leaner (tgla\/tgla) mutant, which has a \nmutation in the Cacna1a gene encoding the \u03b11A subunit. tgla\/tgla has more severely \ncompromised P\/Q-channel function than du2J\/du2J, corresponding to a 60-70% reduction \nin peak P-type current density in Purkinje cells (Lorenzon et al., 1998; Fletcher et al., \n1996; Dove et al., 1998; Wakamori et al., 1998). While optic nerves from control \n(+\/tgla) littermates (used as control since leaner is bred on oligosyndactylism (Os) \nbackground, and Os\/Os is fatal) appeared normal, tgla\/tgla optic nerves had regions of \nmild and severe malformation throughout. Regions of severe injury were infiltrated with \nactivated microglia (Supplemental Fig 3), indicating an ongoing pathology. We \nexamined regions of mild injury to look for the initial changes in axons before wide-\nscale pathology was evident. Nodes of Ranvier in tgla\/tgla axons were often malformed \nand contained numerous vesicular inclusions (Fig 9 f-h). Malformations ranged from a \nmarked distension of the nodal membrane (Fig 9 f), to complete herniation of inclusion-\nloaded axoplasm through the paranodal glial processes (Fig 9 h, shaded blue). Swollen \nand electron lucent peri-nodal glial processes were often seen in these malformed nodes \n(Fig 9 h, shaded red), and while there was not detachment or disintegration of the \nmyelin end-loops they often appeared swollen. Compared to controls, nodes of tgla\/tgla \nanimals were significantly longer (Fig 9 i, 1.25 \u00b10.07, n=19, vs. 1.6 \u00b10.1 \u00b5m, n=26, \np<0.05) and wider (Fig 9 j, 1.06 \u00b10.07, n=19 in +\/tgla vs. 1.77 \u00b10.02, n=27, p<0.01).  \nMorphometric analysis of myelinated axons also revealed significant decreases in axon \ndiameter (0.96 \u00b10.03 \u00b5m +\/tgla, n=70, vs. 0.82  \u00b10.03 \u00b5m in tgla\/tgla, n=105, p<0.05) \nand fiber diameter (1.18 \u00b10.03 \u00b5m +\/tgla, n=70, vs. 1.01 \u00b10.03 \u00b5m in tgla\/tgla, n=105, \np<0.01) in tgla\/tgla animals. The calculated g value was not significantly affected by the \nmutation (0.81 \u00b10.005, n=70, vs. 0.79 \u00b10.006, n=105, p>0.05). \nThe distribution of nodal proteins was examined in du2J\/du2J and tgla\/tgla, \nrevealing a significant reduction in sodium channel clusters and a marked displacement \nof CASPR-1 along axons in tgla\/tgla animals compared to control (Fig 10 a). Regions of \nelongated CASPR-1 expression were sometimes punctuated by sodium channel clusters, \nbut not on all occasions. While \u03b2 IV spectrin and sodium channel clustering appeared \nnormal on the +\/tgla controls, there was no detectable \u03b2 IV spectrin co-localized with the \nremaining sodium channel clusters in tgla\/tgla (Fig 10 b). Less marked changes were \n17 \napparent in du2J\/du2J and included a significant increase in the sodium channel cluster \nlength (Fig 10 c-e). \nFigure 10 near here \nDiscussion \nThe results presented here show that developing central axons express functional \nvoltage-gated calcium channels that, since they contribute to action potential \npropagation, must mediate a significant inward calcium current during the action \npotential. The L-type and P\/Q-type channels involved are expressed in a clustered \npattern along immature axons, and the \u03b11A subunits that form P\/Q channels are \ntransiently clustered in the axolemma at sites where the underlying vesiculotubular \ncomplex is fusing with the axolemma, which includes regions where node of Ranvier \nformation is underway. Vesiculotubular complex is a poorly defined axoplasmic \ncomponent of developing central axons and includes both tubular and vesicular \nelements (Hildebrand & Waxman, 1984; Lindsey & Ellisman, 1985; Nakata et al., \n1998). In the current study, both tubular and vesicular elements appeared to fuse with \nthe axolemma in regions rich in \u03b11A expression, regions that also had a high co-\nincidence with the presence of glial processes aligned to the extracellular surface of the \naxolemma. While the vesiculotubular elements are larger and lack the classic features of \nsynaptic vesicles, they did express some of the molecular components of synaptic \nvesicle fusion such as V-ATPase and the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, while \nthe axolemma was shown to contain a high density of SNAP-25, a component of the \nvesicular docking machinery. Mutations of the \u03b11A subunit, or the \u03b12\u03b4-2 subunit also \nshown to be present at early node sites, resulted in the malformation of nodes of Ranvier \nfeaturing loss of nodal protein localization, disruption of the nodal membrane and a \nbuild up of vesicles under the nodal axolemma. The presence of the various components \nof vesicular fusion throughout the development of myelination is consistent with a role \nfor vesicular glutamate release in the co-ordination of myelination and node of Ranvier \nformation. \n18 \nThe effects of P\/Q channel mutation upon node of Ranvier development is either \na direct effect associated with a disruption in vesicle docking at the nodal axolemma, or \nan indirect effect possibly following a reduction in axonal excitability. Thus, a reduction \nin current through P\/Q channels might produce a decline in the rate of action potential \ndischarge down optic nerve axons, either due to a loss of inward calcium current during \naction potential propagation, or following a reduction in synaptic input to the retinal \nganglion cell somata. While a loss of axon excitability such as this might effect axon \ndevelopment, it seems unlikely to underlie the disruption of node of Ranvier formation \nseen in the current study. It has been shown, for example, that complete block of \nelectrical activity in the optic pathway has no comparable effect upon the development \nof the node, although it does have profound affects upon peri-axonal glial cell processes \n(Friedman & Shatz, 1990), that were not seen in the current study. It is more likely \ntherefore that the effects of P\/Q channel mutation upon node development arise from \ndisruption of tubular-vesicular docking and the subsequent interruption in the supply of \nmembrane proteins necessary for node of Ranvier development, and\/or from the failure \nof a signalling pathway mediated by vesicular release from the nodal axolemma. The \npresence of V-ATPase and glutamate in the vesiculotubular complex, and of SNAP-25 \nin the axolemma, indicate that vesicular fusion triggered by calcium influx through \ncalcium channels will liberate glutamate onto the closely associated oligodendrocyte \nprocesses. Recently, Kukley et al., (2007) and Ziskin et al., (2007) have reported \nvesicular release of glutamate from both developing and mature central axons, leading \nto the activation of AMPA\/Kainate receptors on neighbouring NG2(+) cells. Ziskin et \nal., (2007) suggest that these AMPA\/Kainate receptor mediated currents may have a \nrole in stimulating differentiation of the cells into oligodendrocytes, while Kukley et al., \n(2007) speculate that glutamate release may provide a signal capable of directing \noligodendrocytes to axons. Indeed, it is known that oligodendrocyte migration, \ndifferentiation and survival are regulated by non-NMDA-type glutamate receptors \n(Gallo & Ghiani, 2000), and recent findings have highlighted the presence of NMDA-\ntype glutamate receptors on early oligodendrocyte processes and within myelin itself \n(K\u00e1rad\u00f3ttir et al., 2005; Salter & Fern, 2005; Micu et al., 2006) . Such receptors are \nideally located to receive vesicular glutamate released from developing axons, and \nindeed glutamatergic post-synaptic potentials are observed in white matter \n19 \noligodendrocytes (K\u00e1rad\u00f3ttir et al., 2005). White matter contains no synaptic boutons, \nand taken together the data strongly suggest that axons are the synaptic partners of \noligodendrocytes, at least during myelination. \nSignalling pathways between axons and oligodendrocytes are known to be \nimportant in myelination (Demerens et al., 1996; Stevens et al., 1998). The \nglutamatergic signalling pathways described by Ziskin et al., (2007) and Kukley et al., \n(2007) are consistent with the current findings of glutamate rich vesicular elements \nwithin developing axons, synaptic proteins on these structures and on the axolemma, \nand the requirement of functional axonal synaptic-type calcium channels for proper \nnode of Ranvier formation. A pathway of this type may act in parallel to the recently \nreported leukemia inhibitory factor-mediated (LIF) signalling pathway involving axons \nand astrocytes (Ishibashi et al., 2006). Interruption of a glutamatergic pathway in leaner \ncan be expected to influence the relationship between axons and their myelinating \noligodendrocyte processes. Indeed, dysmyelinated oligodendrocyte phenotypes such as \nthe shiverer (lacking myelin basic protein) and myelin-deficient (md) mutants exhibit a \nsimilar disruption in CASPR-1 expression to that found in leaner in the current study, \nand have a similar reduction in sodium channel clusters (Kaplan et al., 1997; Rasband et \nal., 1999; Tait et al., 2000; Boiko et al., 2001; Arroyo et al., 2002). A direct effect of \ncalcium channel dysfunction upon protein targeting to the node can not be discounted, \nsince axons lacking scaffold elements such as ankyrin G and \u03b2 IV spectrin have reduced \nsodium channel clusters and the presence of vacuoles in the nodal axoplasm (e.g., \n(Komada & Soriano, 2002; Yang et al., 2004).  \nSeveral other spontaneous mutations with compromised P\/Q channel function \nhave been identified in addition to du2J\/du2J and tgla\/tgla. Of these ducky (du\/du), \ntottering (tg\/tg) and tottering\/leaner (tg\/tgla) show marked malformation of axon tracts \n(Meier, 1968; Meier & MacPike, 1971; Rhyu et al., 1999a). While abnormal axons have \nalso been described in P\/Q null mice (Jun et al., 1999) and the rolling (tgrol\/tgrol) \nmutation (Rhyu et al., 1999b), gross disruption of white matter has not been reported in \nthese or other P\/Q mutants. The phenotype of P\/Q mutants is highly variable (Fletcher \n& Frankel, 1999), which is presumably a product of differences in the effects upon \n20 \nchannel function and the degree of compensatory changes in other Ca2+ channel types. \nOf the mutant mice, tgla\/tgla is reported to have the most compromised function and \nshows no compensatory increases in other high-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, \npossibly due to the unaffected level of subunit protein expression in this mutant (Dove \net al., 1998; Wakamori et al., 1998). Large compensatory increases in other high-\nvoltage activated Ca2+ channels have been reported in P\/Q null mice (Jun et al., 1999; \nFletcher et al., 2001), which can completely counter the loss of P\/Q current in \npresynaptic nerve terminals (Inchauspe et al., 2004). Similar compensatory changes \nmay overcome the loss of axonal P\/Q channels in null animals, allowing formation of \nthe node to proceed adequately. \nAlongside the important role in nodal development, we have shown that Ca2+ \nchannels contribute to action potential conduction at a point when the axon diameter is \nincreasing rapidly (Hildebrand & Waxman, 1984). This is a period when Na+ channels \nare being re-distributed to mediate saltatory conduction (Rasband & Shrager, 2000), but \nbefore sufficient compact myelin is present to allow saltatory conduction to proceed. It \nhas been unclear how axons retain the ability to conduct action potentials as they \nundergo this transformation but it is essential for proper CNS development that they do \nso (Shatz, 1996). By boosting inward current during the action potential, Ca2+ channels \nare well placed to counter the temporary biophysical constraints that will inhibit axon \nfunction during early myelination. In particular, the P\/Q channel expression pattern is \nideal to assist with action potential conduction during the period of axon diameter \nexpansion, while the L-type channels may be involved primarily before diameter \nexpansion begins, having a relatively high expression level in P2-P5 axons. Calcium \nchannels may therefore have multiple functions in developing central axons. Two earlier \nstudies failed to report the presence of a significant calcium conductance in developing \ncentral axons. Foster et al., (1982) did not record a DCAP in the neonatal rat optic nerve \nfollowing perfusion with isotonic Ba2+. It appears that the rate of stimulation used in \nthis study was 0.5 Hz and our analysis indicates that any DCAP evoked under these \nconditions would fail after several seconds (see Fig 2 d). Since the recording collected \nin this study were averages of eight sweeps, a short-lived DCAP would have been near \nimpossible to detect. Sun and Chiu (1999) recorded Ca2+ influx into regions between \n21 \nneonatal rat optic nerve glia following axonal stimulation. They report effects of L-type \ncalcium channel blockers that did not reach significance given the small number of \ntrials, but may have done with a larger sample size. \nFinally, in addition to physiological and developmental roles, axonal calcium \nchannels are likely to be significant for a variety of pathological conditions. The axons \nof immature white matter are the focus of injury in a number of developmental white \nmatter injuries including periventricular leukomalacia, the main pathology associated \nwith cerebral palsy (Back & Rivkees, 2004). Cerebral palsy is the most common human \nbirth disorder and is thought to be at least partly ischaemic in origin. Since ischaemic \naxonal injury is largely calcium-mediated (Stys et al., 1992; Fern et al., 1995), calcium \nchannels must represent a major pathway for ischaemic calcium influx into developing \ncentral axons. \n \n22 \nFigure legends \nFigure 1 \nDivalent cation action potentials can be produced in neonatal rat optic nerve axons. a: \nCompound action potentials recorded at three developmental ages. Top traces show the \nnormal, fast conducting, action potential (arrow, following the stimulus artefact). \nMiddle traces show block of this action potential in zero-Na+\/TTX (1\u00b5M).

Note the absence of a divalent \ncation action potential at P22. b: Action potential amplitude recorded at P2 vs. time. \nZero-Na+\/TTX blocks the action potential after ~10 min and switching to Ba2+\/Ca2+ \nproduces a divalent cation action potential after 12 min that then declines slowly. c: \nSimilar plot of action potentials at P10 and P22. d: Traces of normal action potential, \nblock in zero-Na+\/TTX and perfusion with Ba2+\/Ca2+ (in zero-Na+\/TTX) solution at P2 \nin the presence of the specific L-type blocker diltiazem (50 \u00b5M). No divalent cation \naction potential is apparent. e: Similar data at P12, showing large divalent cation action \npotential in diltiazem. f: Experiment as above demonstrating a much reduced divalent \ncation action potential in the presence of \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA (100 nM) g: Amplitude of the \ndivalent cation action potential relative to normal action potential at various ages. The \ndivalent cation action potential was blocked by diltiazem at P2-5 but not at P8-12. \u03c9-\nAgatoxin IVA significantly blocked the divalent cation action potential at P8-12, as did \nthe non-selective calcium channel blocker La3+ (100\u00b5M).

Bottom: A large \namplitude slow conducting DCAP is recorded in the presence of 95 mM Ba2+. b: Action \npotential amplitude is plotted against time, demonstrating the decline in the DCAP over \n23 \na ~10 min time course. c: A similar protocol showing the time-course of a DCAP \nrecorded in 60 mM Ca2+. Switching to zero-Na+ \/ TTX solution produced block of the \nnormal action potential and changing to 60 mM extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a short-\nlasting DCAP. d: The divalent cation reversal potential in axons calculated assuming a \nstarting axoplasmic concentration of 100 nM, an extracellular divalent cation \nconcentration of 90 mM, a resting membrane potential of -70 mV, a DCAP amplitude of \n100 mV and a membrane capacitance of 1 \u00b5F\/cm2. It is also assumed that there is no \nsignificant extrusion of divalent cations entering during the DCAP and that there is no \ninflux into the axon when the axolemma is at rest. Given these assumptions, it is \napparent that a small number of divalent cation action potentials have a dramatic affect \nupon the divalent cation reversal potential, in particular for the smaller diameter axons \n(0.1 \u00b5m, filled squares). Reducing the extracellular divalent cation concentration to 40 \nmM has minimal effect upon the time course of the collapse of the reversal potential \n(grey circles, plotted for a 1\u00b5m axon). e: The time between the first appearance of a \nDCAP and its failure (survival time) in various high divalent cation conditions, showing \nthat varying the total divalent cation concentration between 40 and 100 mM had no \nsignificant affect, as predicted in \"d\". \n \nFigure 3. \nCa2+ channels contribute to normal action potentials in developing axons. a: P12 control \nshowing the compound action potential recorded at T=0 (control start) and T=150 \n(control end) min. b: Non-selective Ca2+ channel block with La3+ reduced action \npotential amplitude at P12. c: Block of L-type channels with diltiazem at P12 did not \nreduce action potential amplitude (slowing is evident). d: La3+ and diltiazem produced a \nsimilar, reversible, decline in the compound action potential at P2. e: La3+\uf020 but not \ndiltiazem produced a reversible decline in the action potential at P12. f: Summary \nshowing the effect of La3+ or diltiazem upon compound action potential amplitude at \ndifferent ages. g: Block of P\/Q-type channels with \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA (100 nM) reduced \naction potential amplitude at P12. h: Block of N-type channels with \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA \n(1 \u00b5M) had no significant affect at P12. i: Time course of effect of \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA, \u03c9-\nconotoxin GVIA and \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIC on action potential amplitude at P12. j: \n24 \nSummary of the effects of \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA or \u03c9-conotoxins upon action potential \namplitude at P12. * = p<0.05, *** = p<0.001. \n \nFigure 4. \nThe evolution of ion channel clusters in optic nerve during development. a: The density \nof sodium channel (black), \u03b11A (red) and \u03b11C (blue) clusters during development. b: \u03b11A \nsubunits (green) are clustered on NF-70(+) axons (red). c: Few \u03b11A subunits (green) co-\nlocalised with CNPase(+) oligodendroglia (red).
