These results support RDT propositions. \n(Word count: 98) \n \n \n \nKeywords: relational discrepancies, emotion, relationship type, discrepancy valence \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 3 \nHumans are social beings, typically having many simultaneous relationships, \nsome of which last years. There is no doubt that these relationships are important \nsources of emotion. However, little is known about why different emotions are \nexperienced in relationships (Simpson, Collins, Tran, & Haydon, 2007). Several theories \npropose that emotions are experienced when individuals believe their partner or the \nrelationship is not consistent with their expectations (e.g., Emotions-in-Relationships \nModel, Berschied, 1983; the Ideal Standards Model, Simpson, Fletcher, & Campbell, \n2001) However, these arguments do not specify which types of emotion are \nexperienced.  \nThere are two distinct clusters of negative emotions; dejection- and agitation-\nrelated emotions (see Higgins, 1987, for a review). Drawing on Self-discrepancy theory \n(SDT; Higgins, 1987), which proposes that discrepancies between different self aspects \nhave specific emotional consequences, we advanced Relational Discrepancy Theory \n(RDT; Robins & Boldero, 2003). This theory, although setting out to explain the \nemergence of social structure, also proposed that dejection- and agitation-related \nemotions result from discrepancies between relational partners in the extents that they \nare meeting two relational guides; the ideal and the ought relational guides. Although \nsome preliminary research supported these propositions (Croyle, 2001), they remain \nlargely untested. The present three studies examined the propositions that unique \nassociations exist between relational discrepancies and dejection- and agitation-related \nemotions, and that these associations are stronger when a relationship is viewed as an \nexchange relationship rather than when it is views as an interdependent relationship. \nThey also examine whether discrepancy valence (i.e., whether individuals believe they \nare better or worse than their partner at meeting relational guides) is an additional \nmoderator in relationships with an assumed hierarchy (as in workplaces).  \n \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 4 \nRelational discrepancies and negative emotions \nRDT proposes that perceived discrepancies are important determinants of \nemotional outcomes in relationships. This proposition is not new. The ideal standards \nmodel (Simpson, Fletcher, & Campbell, 2001) proposes that discrepancies between \none\u2019s perceptions of one\u2019s actual partner and relationship and one\u2019s ideal partner and \nrelationship are the basis of evaluations of partner and relationship quality, including \naffective responses such as relationship satisfaction. Fletcher, Simpson, Thomas, and \nGiles (1999) found that smaller ideal-partner discrepancies are associated with more \nfavourable ratings. Across the first year of dating, smaller ideal-partner discrepancies \nare associated with greater relationship quality whereas larger discrepancies are \nassociated with relationship dissolution (Fletcher, Simpson, & Thomas, 2000).  \nHowever, RDT differs from other relationship discrepancy models which focus on \ndifferences between a partner and some relationship ideal (e.g., Simpson et al., 2001) \nor differences between an actual relationship and particular comparison levels (Thibaut \n& Kelley, 1959). RDT proposes that individuals compare the extents to which they and \ntheir partner possess the qualities and attributes that make up their relational guides. \nWhen these differ relational discrepancies exist. \nConsistent with the ideal standards models, RDT proposes that what individuals \nwould like to have in a relationship (the ideal relational guide) is an important \nrelationship standard. Additionally, consistent with SDT, RDT proposes that the ought \nrelational guide (how one ought to be in relationships) is also important. Relational \ndiscrepancies with respect to these two guides are proposed to be associated with \nspecific types of emotional consequences; consistent with SDT propositions (Higgins, \n1987).  \nAccording to SDT, because the ideal guide represents positive outcomes, ideal \ndiscrepancies represent their absence and result in dejection-related emotions (e.g., \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 5 \ndepression). On the other hand, discrepancies with the ought guide represent the \npresence of negative outcomes and result in agitation-related emotions (e.g., anxiety). \nLarger discrepancies are associated with more intense emotions, especially when they \nhave self-regulatory significance (Higgins, 1987, 1989). Adapting these principles to \nrelationships, RDT proposes that ideal relational discrepancies result in dejection-\nrelated emotions and ought relational discrepancies in agitation-related emotions, with \nlarger discrepancies being associated with more intense emotions. Accordingly, it goes \nfurther than other discrepancy models by specifying the distinct emotion types \nassociated with the two types of relational discrepancies. \nPast research supports the proposition that perceiving that one is different to a \nrelational partner is associated with negative emotions. Individuals asked to focus on \nhow they and close relationship partners are similar report positive emotions whereas \nthose who focus on differences report negative emotions (Tesser, Beach, Mendolia, \nCrepaz, Davies, & Pennebaker, 1998). However, no research has examined the \nassociations between ideal and ought relational discrepancies and dejection and \nagitation. \nRelational discrepancies are conceptually related to personal discrepancies and \nperceptions of partner\u2019s personal discrepancies. Figure 1 shows the two possible \nconfigurations of relational discrepancies and personal discrepancies, depending on \nwhether the personal or partner discrepancy is larger.  \nIndividuals\u2019 personal discrepancies, because they are self-discrepancies, are \nassociated with negative emotions, with discrepancies with ideals being associated with \ndejection and those with oughts being associated with agitation (see Boldero & Francis, \n1999; Higgins, 1999; for reviews). Campbell, Simpson, Kashy, and Fletcher (2001) found \nthat individuals\u2019 ratings of their partners\u2019 actual selves relative to their ideal standards \nwere negatively associated with relationship quality, a composite measure including \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 6 \nrelationship satisfaction. Thus, perceived partner discrepancies should be associated \nwith negative emotions. RDT\u2019s claim is that relational discrepancies are an additional \neffect, reliably associated with negative emotions after controlling for personal and \npartner discrepancies. The theory makes this claim because when individuals compare \nthemselves and a partner, the result indicates their relative performance. This is also an \nindicator of how the relationship is faring. Thus, when this comparison indicates that they \nare different, negative emotions result (Tesser et al., 1998) and these would be \nadditional to any emotions associated with personal or partner discrepancies which \nindicate how the individuals are faring. \n \nThe impact of discrepancy valence  \nFigure 1 shows the two types of discrepancy valence, namely, when individuals \nbelieve they are better than a partner at meeting a relational guide (i.e., a positively-\nvalenced discrepancy) and when they believe they are worse (i.e., a negatively-\nvalenced discrepancy). Robins and Boldero (2003) made no specific predictions about \nthe impact of the valence of relational discrepancies on associations between relational \ndiscrepancies and emotions. Furthermore, the impact of discrepancy valence is unclear \nbecause of the role of equity in relationships. According to Equity theory (Walster, \nBerscheid, & Walster, 1973), individuals who receive relatively more or less than they \ncontribute to a relationship feel dissatisfied. Thus, it is possible that relational \ndiscrepancies have negative emotional consequences, irrespective of valence. This \nassociation occurs in many relationship contexts (e.g., Buunk & Mustaers, 1999; Peters \n& van den Bos, 2008). However, in some relationships there are expectations that one \npartner should be \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d than the other and violations of this expectation \nmay be associated with negative emotions. For example, in work relationships, believing \nthat one is better than a better-paid supervisor may lead to anger. So, in cases where \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 7 \nthere are particular expectations of relative standings with regard to relational guides, \ndiscrepancy valence may moderate associations between relational discrepancies and \nnegative emotions. \n \nRelationship type as a moderator of relational discrepancy-emotion associations \nRDT proposes that relational discrepancies do not have the same associations \nwith emotions in all relationships. Specifically, it predicts that associations are reduced if \nthe nature of the relationship is consistent with these discrepancies.  \nIn certain relationships it is \u201caccepted\u201d that one partner will be better than the other \nat meeting the relational guides, relationships typified by Fiske\u2019s (1991; 1992) authority \nranking (AR) relational model. In these relationships (e.g., academic-graduate student), \nrelational partners are interdependent, with one being \u201cthe leader\u201d who guides and \nadvises \u201cthe follower\u201d. In other relationships, partners are not preoccupied with \nindividual performance but view the relationship from a communal perspective (e.g., \nteams); Fiske\u2019s communal sharing relational model (CS). Here individuals are also \ninterdependent but contribute different things to the relationship. The essential \ndifference between AR and CS relationships is that, although both are based on \ninterdependence, in CS relationships partners are equivalent whereas in AR \nrelationships they are not (Haslam, 1994).  \nIn contrast, there are relational models where balance and exchange are \nimportant. Fiske (1991; 1992) identified the equality matching (EM) relational model, \nwhere individuals are expected to contribute equal amounts to the relationship (e.g., \nacademic collaborators), and the market pricing (MP) relational model, in which partners \nare oriented to socially-meaningful ratios, such as wages (e.g., employer-employee \nrelationships). Because of the focus on balance and exchange, RDT proposes that \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 8 \nrelational discrepancies are more strongly associated with negative emotions in these \nrelationships than in interdependent relationships.  \nThis proposition is consistent with intuitive beliefs about how individuals feel in \ncertain relationships. In hierarchically organized work-places employees do not object to \na supervisor earning more and married couples happily purchase joint property even \nthough one partner contributes more financially. However, students feel \u201cused\u201d when \nstudy partners do not \u201cpull their weight\u201d and customers feel angry when service-\nproviders overcharge.  \nThis is also consistent with preliminary empirical findings. Francis (1997) assessed \ndiscrepancies between individuals\u2019 beliefs about how they actually are and how their \nwork supervisor thinks they ought to be. She found that associations between \ndiscrepancies and negative emotions were weaker in interdependent relationships than \nin exchange relationships.  \nSuch moderation effects are also consistent with the results of studies \ninvestigating the modification of Tesser\u2019s (1988) self-evaluation maintenance (SEM) \nmodel for romantic relationships (Beach & Tesser, 1995). SEM proposes that when one \nis outperformed by a relational partner in domains important to one\u2019s self-definition, \nnegative emotions are experienced whereas when one outperforms a relational partner \npositive emotions are experienced. Moreover, emotions are more intense to the extent \nthat the relationship is close. Beach and Tesser proposed, however, that in romantic \nrelationships these emotions may be mitigated by sympathetic responses towards the \npartner. Beach, Tesser, Fincham, Jones, Johnson, and Whitaker (1998) found that \nmarried individuals reported feeling better about being outperformed by, rather than \noutperforming, their partner in domains that were highly relevant to their partner. In \ncontrast, in high self-relevance domains, they generally reported more negative affect \nwhen they were outperformed by their partner. These results suggest that the negative \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 9 \nconsequences of being outperformed can be attenuated in some circumstances. \nConsistent with RDT, Beach et al. (1998) commented that \u201cas couples become more \ninterdependent and communal in orientation they appear to become more motivated or \nmore adept at extending empathy and sympathy toward the partner in the more difficult, \nhigh self-relevance areas\u201d (pp. 935-936). \nHowever, in some relationships, the acknowledgment of hierarchy may be \nproblematic and relational discrepancies may be associated with negative emotions. For \nexample, in employment settings performance is often scrutinised by others external to \na relationship. For instance, a supervisor may assess the performance and control the \noutcomes of two work colleagues. In such circumstances, individuals who acknowledge \nthat they are not as good as a colleague may feel insecure about retaining their jobs or \ngaining promotion or other benefits. So accepting a lesser \u201cfollower\u201d role and giving a \nrelationship a hierarchical (AR) quality may not diminish negative emotion.   \nNegative consequences may also occur for those who believe that they are better \nthan colleagues. They may be annoyed or frustrated by colleagues who are \u201cnot pulling \ntheir weight\u201d, particularly if this discrepancy is not recognized by the formal hierarchy of \nan organization and the structure of work arrangements.  \nAccordingly, in competitive, scrutinised environments acceptance of AR \nrelationships may not, in fact, ameliorate negative emotions. It is only when competition \nis dissolved in team-like structures that moderation of negative emotions may occur. \nHowever, if the relationship is viewed as communal, with colleagues jointly contributing \nto successful performance, relational discrepancies are unlikely to be associated with \nnegative emotions. Thus, we argue that in workplaces and other settings where \nrelationships are imposed on individuals and where competition, external scrutiny, and \nrewards are commonplace, discrepancy-emotion associations will not be reduced in AR \nrelationships, whereas in CS relationships they will. In contrast, in more freely chosen \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 10 \nrelationships, with fewer external structures and scrutiny, both AR and CS relationships \nwill have moderating effects. \nFinally, it is possible that that the proposed moderation by relationship type may \nbe different for the two types of discrepancy-emotion associations. Self-regulation with \nrespect to the ideal self-guide satisfies nurturance or growth needs whereas self-\nregulation with respect to the ought self-guide satisfies security needs (Higgins, 1996). \nShah and Higgins (1997) proposed that \u201cought\u201d goals are necessities for survival \nwhereas \u201cideal\u201d goals are growth needs whose accomplishment is not necessary. They \nreasoned it was more imperative to achieve ought than ideal goals. In four studies they \nfound that individuals pursued important ought goals, regardless of perceived \nachievement expectancy, whereas important ideal goals were pursued as a function of \nexpectancy. This difference between what \u201cis\u201d and \u201cis not\u201d necessary suggests it may be \nmore difficult to ameliorate negative emotions associated with absent necessities (i.e., \nought relational discrepancies) than those associated with absent but desired \nachievements (i.e., ideal relational discrepancies).  \n \nThe current studies \nThe current studies were designed to provide the first test of two RDT \npropositions, specifically, that ideal and ought relational discrepancies are uniquely \nassociated with dejection and agitation, respectively, and that relationship type \nmoderates these associations. They also examined moderation by discrepancy valence \nwhich we predicted would occur in relationships with an assumed hierarchy. Study 1 \nexamined the proposed unique associations of ideal and ought relational discrepancies \nwith dejection and agitation and whether these occur when associations with personal \nand partner\u2019s personal discrepancies are statistically controlled. It also examined \nmoderation by relationship type and whether discrepancy valence was an additional \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 11 \nmoderator. A range of relationships were sampled to establish the wide applicability \nclaimed by Robins and Boldero (2003). Studies 2 and 3 examined these propositions \nbut focussed on specific relationships; friendships (Study 2) and relationships with \nsupervisors and colleagues in workplaces (Study 3). These relationships were chosen to \nallow a detailed examination of the impact of discrepancy valence in relationships that \nhave an assumed hierarchy (i.e., between supervisors and supervisees) compared with \nthose that do not (i.e., relationships with friends and colleagues). Finally, by considering \nrelationships in which there is no assumed hierarchy and where acknowledgment of \nhierarchy has few consequences outside the relationship (i.e., friendships) and those \nwhere it does (i.e., collegial relationships), the proposed limitation to the moderation by \nhierarchical acknowledgment could be examined.  \n \n \nStudy 1 \nThis study examined whether ideal relational discrepancies are uniquely \nassociated with dejection and ought relational discrepancies with agitation, and that \nthese associations occur when individuals\u2019 and partners\u2019 personal discrepancies are \nstatistically controlled. It also examined the moderating impact of relationship type on \ndiscrepancy-emotion associations. To ensure that both exchange and interdependent \nrelationships were sampled, participants were asked to consider a relationship \ncharacterised by one of Fiske\u2019s (1991, 1992) four relational models. As hierarchical \nrelationships can involve individuals who are either superior or inferior to a relational \npartner, we asked some participants to focus on a relationship in which they were the \n\u201cleader\u201d (AR-L) and others to focus on a relationship in which they were the \u201cfollower\u201d \n(AR-F). Finally, it explored whether discrepancy valence moderates discrepancy-\nemotion associations.  \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 12 \n \nMethod \nParticipants. Two hundred and forty-five students, 48 males (20%) and 196 \nfemales enrolled in a psychology subject at the University of Melbourne participated as \npart of a class exercise. They ranged in age from 18 to 53 years (M = 21.23 years, SD = \n4.63).  \nProcedure. In one of their regularly scheduled classes, participants completed a \nquestionnaire assessing the target factors. Before completing this, they read a \ndescription of a relationship exemplifying one relational model (Haslam, 1994), were \nasked to select a current relationship with similar features, and to respond with respect \nto this relationship. In all, 51 participants (21%) read the CS description, 52 (21%) the \nEM description, 49 (20%) the MP description, 50 (20%) the AR-L description, and 43 \n(18%) the AR-F description.  \nMaterials. The questionnaire assessed the following factors: \nRelational and personal discrepancies were measured using a modified version of \nFrancis, Boldero, and Samball\u2019s (2006) idiographic self-lines technique. Participants \nwere asked to think of up to five qualities they would ideally like to have and five they \nshould or ought to have in their relationship. We focused on participants\u2019 own qualities \nas we wanted those that had self-regulatory significance. Participants then identified the \nantonym of each attribute and, on a 70 mm vertical line joining the attribute and its \nantonym, indicated where both they and their relational partner were currently located \n(their own and their partner\u2019s actual selves) with respect to the attribute.  \nIdeal and ought relational discrepancies were assessed using the absolute mean \ndifference (in mm) across attributes between the position indicated for participants\u2019 \nactual selves and those of their relational partners. This was done separately for ideal \nand ought guides (as in Figure 1). Personal and partners\u2019 personal ideal and ought \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 13 \ndiscrepancies were assessed by taking the distance from the top of the line to the \nposition indicated for the participant\u2019s actual self (personal discrepancies) and to the \nposition of the partner\u2019s actual self. Internal consistencies were adequate, \u03bb\u2019s < .65.1\nDiscrepancy valence (i.e., whether a participant reported that they were better or worse \nthan their partner at meeting the relational guides) was also recorded.  \n \nRelationship Type. The Modes of Relationship Questionnaire (MORQ; Haslam & \nFiske, 1999), which assesses the extent to which a relationship is characterized by each \nof Fiske\u2019s (1991) four relational models, was used to check whether participants \nreported on exchange (i.e., EM or MP) or interdependent (i.e., CS or AR) relationships \nin response to the relational model descriptions. In all there were five subscales, each \ncomprising 6 items (see Appendix 1). Participants indicated extent to which the items \ndescribed the relationship on 7-point Likert scales, ranging from not at all (0) to very \nmuch (6). The mean across the items for each subscale comprised the measure of the \napplicability of each relational model to the relationship. All scales had adequate internal \nconsistency, \u03bbs > .62.  \n Emotions experienced in relationships. Participants indicated the extent to which \nthey experienced 32 positive and negative emotions in their relationships on 4-point \nLikert scales, from not at all (0) to very much (3). As RDT makes predictions about \nnegative emotions, positive emotions were used as filler items. Principal components \nanalysis was used to determine the structure underlying responses to negative emotion \nitems. The scree plot suggested that a two factor-solution was most appropriate. These \nfactors accounted for 59.0% of the variance in responses. Items that had either high or \nlow loadings on both factors were eliminated. The loadings of remaining items \nsuggested that the factors reflected dejection (i.e., burdened, disappointed, \ndiscouraged, displeased, inadequate) and agitation (i.e., angry, annoyed, tense, \ntrapped, worried), the emotions proposed by Higgins (1987) to be associated with ideal \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 14 \nand ought self-discrepancies. Mean responses to the items on each were calculated. \nBoth scales had adequate internal consistency: dejection, \u03bb < .72; agitation, \u03bb < .88.  \n \nResults and Discussion \nDescriptive summary. On average, participants reported small ideal, M = 6.70, SD \n= 7.19, and ought relational discrepancies, M = 7.34, SD = 8.76. Approximately half \nreported their partners as better than they were at meeting relational guides; ideal, 55%, \nought, 50%. They also reported relatively large personal ideal, M = 21.19, SD = 10.80, \nand ought, M = 21.27, SD = 12.94, and partner ideal, M = 19.11, SD = 10.35, and ought \nM = 20.55, SD = 12.41, discrepancies. Participants reported low levels of dejection, M = \n.49, SD = .57, and agitation, M = .47, SD = .56.  \nParticipants gave higher ratings on the CS scale, M = 3.59, SD = 1.25, and lower \nratings on the two AR scales (leader, M = 1.72, SD = 1.31, and follower, M = 1.79, SD = \n1.59) than on the EM, M = 2.82, SD = 1.16, and MP scales, M = 2.82, SD = 1.03, \nscales, F (4, 240) = 97.69, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .62, regardless of relational model description, \nsuggesting biased reporting of the extent to which the models described relationships \n(Haslam, personal communication). Thus, we calculated normal deviate scores for each \nscale. These revealed that the elicited relationships were consistent with the relationship \ndescription provided (see Table 1). As a result, we classified relationships as exchange \nor interdependent relationships using the relational mode descriptions provided.  \nEffects of relational discrepancies over and above personal and partner \ndiscrepancies. Before considering effects of valence and relationship type, we \ninvestigated whether personal, partner, or relational discrepancies were associated with \nemotions. In particular we were interested in whether relational discrepancies had \neffects over and above those of the other two discrepancy types.  \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 15 \nThe absolute value of ideal and ought relational discrepancies along with ideal \nand ought personal and partner discrepancies were included in two regressions. \nDejection was associated with ideal relational discrepancies, \u03b2 = .17, p < .01, but neither \npersonal nor partner ideal discrepancies. Agitation was associated with all three ought \ndiscrepancies. Personal, \u03b2 = .16, p < .01, and relational discrepancies, \u03b2 = .14, p < .01, \nwere positively associated (i.e., larger discrepancies were associated with more intense \nagitation) and partner\u2019s discrepancies were negatively associated, \u03b2 = -.17, p < .001.  \nThis last result, although not central to our investigation, was unexpected. It \nindicates that once personal and relational discrepancies are controlled, larger partner \ndiscrepancies are associated with less agitation. It seems that people are less agitated \nthe more their partners do not live up to ought guides, suggesting there may be positive \nemotional benefits of comparison with a partner who is not a strong performer. This \naside, the results indicate that relational discrepancies are associated with negative \nemotions after controlling for personal and partner discrepancies. With these \nassociations established, subsequent analyses focussed solely on relational \ndiscrepancies.  \nRelational type and discrepancy valence as moderators of associations between \nrelational discrepancies and emotion. To test RDT\u2018s predictions that ideal and ought \nrelational discrepancies are uniquely associated with dejection and agitation and that \nrelationship type moderates these associations, emotions were regressed on both the \nabsolute values of ideal and ought relational discrepancies (Step 1), the main effects of \nrelationship type (interdependent coded -1, exchange +1) (Step 2), and the two-way \ninteraction between the appropriate relational discrepancy (e.g., ideal relational \ndiscrepancy in the case of dejection) and relationship type (Step 3). To examine \nwhether discrepancy valence was an additional moderator, the main effect of this factor \n(negative coded -1, positive coded +1) was included on Step 2, its interaction with the \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 16 \nappropriate discrepancy on Step 3, and the three-way interaction between the \ndiscrepancy, relationship type, and discrepancy valence on Step 4. As emotions were \nskewed, the analyses were conducted in conjunction with optimal scaling.2\nThe models including only main effects of ideal and ought relational discrepancies \n(Step 1) accounted for significant variance in both emotions (dejection, R2 = .10, p < \n.001; agitation, R2 = .07 p < .001). Consistent with RDT propositions, dejection was \npositively associated with ideal relational discrepancies, \u03b2 = .26, p < .001, and agitation \nwith ought relational discrepancies, \u03b2 = .24, p < .001. The second step of both analyses \ndid not account for additional variance in either emotion. The third steps explained \nadditional variance (dejection, \u0394R2 = .04; agitation, \u0394R2 = .03, p < .05) whereas the \nfourth did not.  \n Following \nAiken and West (1991), we centred discrepancies before calculating interaction terms. \nThe 10 participants who reported no ideal discrepancies and the 17 who reported no \nought discrepancies were omitted from the analyses.  \nRelationship type moderated the impact of ideal and ought relational \ndiscrepancies on dejection and agitation; \u03b2 = .48, p < .001, \u03b2 = .17, p < .05, respectively. \nSimple slope analyses revealed that, consistent with predictions, dejection was \nassociated with ideal relational discrepancies, t (211) = 3.09, p < .05, and agitation with \nought relational discrepancies, t (219) = 4.56, p < .05, in exchange relationships but not \nin interdependent ones (dejection, t (211) = 1.08, ns; agitation, t (219) = .89, ns) (see \nFigure 2).  \nDiscrepancy valence moderated the association of ideal relational discrepancies \nwith dejection, \u03b2 = .47, p < .001, but not of ought relational discrepancies with agitation. \nFor those who reported they were better than their partner at meeting the ideal guide, \nthe association was significant, t (211) = 3.42, p < .05, whereas for those who were \nworse, it was not t (211) = 1.76, ns; (see Figure 3). This possibly occurred because of \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 17 \nthe sampling of a broad range of relationships, including some employment \nrelationships where there is an assumption of hierarchy. Violation of this assumption in \nthe form of believing that one is better than one\u2019s supervisor would likely be associated \nwith negative emotions. The absence of a moderating effect of valence for ought \nrelational discrepancies may have occurred because of the survival needs represented \nby these discrepancies (Shah & Higgins, 1997). It does not matter whether you or \npartner are better or worse when survival needs are concerned. \nBecause of a possible impact in this Study of workplace relationships on \nassociations between relational discrepancies and negative emotions, Study 2 was \ndesigned to examine relational discrepancies in relationships that are freely chosen, \nnamely friendships. \n \nStudy 2 \n This study examined the impact of ideal and ought relational discrepancies on \nnegative emotions experienced in friendships and the proposed moderation by \nrelationship type. Consistent with Study 1, we predicted that ideal relational \ndiscrepancies would be uniquely associated with dejection and ought relational \ndiscrepancies with agitation, and that these associations would occur in exchange \nrelationships but not in interdependent ones. Finally, we predicted that, because \nfriendships do not involve assumed hierarchies, discrepancy valence would not \nmoderate associations.  \n \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 18 \nMethod \nParticipants. Eighty individuals, 32 males (36%), 57 females (64%), and one \nparticipant who did not specify gender, participated either in partial fulfilment of course \nresearch participation requirement (n = 38) or in response to a request from one of the \ninvestigators or an acquaintance (n = 42). Participants ranged in age from 17 to 44 \nyears (M = 20.25 years, SD = 3.93).  \nMaterials and procedure. The materials and procedure were identical to those of \nStudy 1 with the one exception. Participants did not read relationship descriptions, \nrather they were asked to focus on a relationship with a friend. They completed the \nquestionnaire either independently or in small groups. \n \nResults and Discussion \nDescriptive Summary. Participants reported smaller absolute ideal, M = 4.34, SD \n= 5.32, than ought, M = 6.66, SD = 7.50, relational discrepancies, F (1, 79) = 13.16, p \n<=.001, \u03b7p2 = .14. Twenty-four (30%) reported that they were closer to their ideal guide \nthan their friend, whereas 51 (64%) reported their friend as closer than they were. The \nremaining five (6%) reported no difference in the extent to which they and their friend \nwere meeting this guide. Similarly, 19 (25%) reported that they were closer to their \nought guide than their friend, whereas 56 (75%) reported that their friend was closer \nthan they were. The remaining five (6%) reported no difference in the extent to which \nthey and their friends were meeting this guide. Thus, consistent with research examining \nperceptions of close others (e.g., Gagn\u00e9 & Lydon, 2004), there was evidence of a bias \ntowards viewing friends as better than oneself with respect to both guides.  \nExamination of the extents to which the friendships reported were characterized \nby the relational modes revealed a reluctance to characterize these relationships using \nother than the CS model. Accordingly, as in Study 1, we calculated normal deviate \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 19 \nscores for each model and used the largest of these to classify relationships as \nexchange or interdependent relationships. In all, 46 (58%) were classified as \ninterdependent and 34 (42%) as exchange relationships. Interestingly, consistent with \nthe RDT proposition that relational discrepancies are better tolerated in interdependent \nrelationships, ideal and ought relational discrepancies differed as a function of \nrelationship type, F (1, 78) = 5.02, p =.028, \u03b7p2 = .06. Larger discrepancies of both types \nwere reported in interdependent relationships (ideal, M = 4.80, SD = 6.00; ought, M = \n8.59, SD = 8.59) than in exchange relationships (ideal, M = 3.69, SD = 4.21; ought, M = \n6.66, SD = 7.50). Finally, participants reported experiencing low levels of dejection, M \n=.29, SD = .33, and agitation, M =.27, SD = .44, in their relationships.  \nRelationship type and discrepancy valence as moderators of associations \nbetween relational discrepancy magnitudes and emotions experienced in friendships. As \nin Study 1, we investigated whether relational discrepancies were uniquely associated \nwith negative emotions, and whether associations were moderated by relational type or \ndiscrepancy valence using hierarchical regression analyses. It was not possible to \nexamine the joint moderation by these factors as there were insufficient participants who \nhad negative discrepancies in exchange relationships (both n \u2264 11). However, as joint \nmoderation did not occur in Study 1, we reasoned this was not problematic. There was \nsufficient power, however, to investigate the moderating effects in separate analyses. \nThus, we performed two sets of hierarchical regression analyses; one examining \nmoderation by relationship type, the second by discrepancy valence. As emotion scores \nwere skewed, the analyses were conducted in conjunction with optimal scaling. The five \nindividuals who reported no ideal or ought relational discrepancies were excluded from \nthe discrepancy valence moderation analyses. \nEmotions were regressed, in order, on the main effects of absolute relational \ndiscrepancy magnitudes (Step 1), the main effects of relationship type or discrepancy \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 20 \nvalence (Step 2), and the two-way interaction of the appropriate relational discrepancy \nmagnitude and the moderator of interest (Step 3). Discrepancy magnitudes were \ncentred on their means before calculating interaction terms.   \nConsistent with predictions, dejection was associated with larger ideal relational \ndiscrepancies, \u03b2 = .78, p < .001, and agitation with larger ought relational discrepancies, \n\u03b2 = .49, p < .001. Dejection was also associated with smaller ought relational, \u03b2 = -.26, p \n< .05, which was likely a result of the high correlation between the two discrepancies, r \n(80) = .65, p < .001. Further, relationship type moderated associations with ideal, \u03b2 = \n.36, p < .001, and ought, \u03b2 = .23, p < .001, discrepancies whereas discrepancy valence \ndid not. Consistent with RDT, associations were stronger in exchange relationships \n(dejection, t (78) = 9.01, p < .05; agitation, t (78) = 4.59, p < .05) than in interdependent \nrelationships (dejection, t (78) = 3.92, p < .05; agitation, t (78) = 2.41, p < .05) (see \nFigure 4).   \nThis study provides evidence for RDT\u2019s propositions in relationships in which there \nare no assumed hierarchies and which are freely chosen. Relational discrepancies were \nuniquely associated with negative emotions and these associations were moderated by \nrelationship type but not discrepancy valence. Specifically, the associations between \nrelational discrepancies and emotions were weaker in friendships characterized by \ninterdependence than exchange. Moreover, the absence of moderation by discrepancy \nvalence suggests that the moderating effect found in Study 1 was a result of the \ninclusion of a broad range of relationships, some of which had assumed hierarchies. We \nargued that in such relationships, discrepancy valence may be important. However, \nneither this Study nor Study 1 provides conclusive evidence for this argument.  \nStudy 3 was specifically designed to test this proposition by examining the \nassociations between relational discrepancies and emotions in relationships with \nsupervisors in the workplace. In addition, by examining these associations in \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 21 \nrelationships with work colleagues it was possible to test our argument that, in contexts \nwhere relationships are not so freely chosen and where competition and third party \nscrutiny are commonplace, acknowledging a relationship as hierarchical (i.e., AR) may \nnot ameliorate negative emotions.   \n \nStudy 3 \nThis study examined the impact of relational discrepancies on negative emotions \nexperienced in relationships with supervisors and colleagues. We predicted that, \nbecause work relationships with supervisors involve assumed hierarchies whereas \nthose with colleagues do not, discrepancy valence would moderate associations in \nsupervisory but not collegial relationships, such that for those who believe they are \nbetter than a supervisor at meeting relational guides, associations with negative \nemotions would be stronger than for those who believe they are worse. Finally, because \nrelationships with colleagues are open to scrutiny by those who control outcomes (e.g., \nsupervisors), we predicted that acknowledging that a relationship with a colleague is \nhierarchical would be associated with negative emotions. \n \nMethod  \nParticipants. One hundred and seventeen students, 88 females (75%) and 29 \nmales (25%) enrolled in a psychology subject at the University of Melbourne, who had \nnot participated in Studies 1 or 2, participated as part of a research participation \nrequirement. All were in some form of paid employment. They ranged in age from 17 to \n50 years (M = 21.37 years, SD = 5.76). \nMaterials and Procedure. The questionnaire had two sections: One assessed the \nfactors in the relationship participants had with a work supervisor, the other with respect \nto a relationship with a work colleague. The measures were identical to those used in \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 22 \nStudy 2. The order of presentation of the questionnaire sections was counterbalanced. \nParticipants were tested in groups of up to 20. \n \nResults \nDescriptive Summary. Participants reported small absolute ideal and ought \nrelational discrepancies (supervisor, ideal, M = 7.32, SD = 6.62, ought, M = 6.74, SD = \n6.45; colleague, ideal, M =3.64, SD = 4.16, ought, M =4.36, SD = 4.82). Larger \ndiscrepancies of both types were reported in relationships with supervisors than with \ncolleagues, F (1, 110) = 31.43, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .222. Participants reported low levels of \nemotions (supervisor, dejection, M = .70, SD = .62, agitation, M = .70, SD = .71; \ncolleague, dejection, M = .35, SD = .43; colleague, agitation, M =.30, SD = .43). As we \nexpected no bias in reporting the extent to which the relationships were described by the \nfour relational models, we classified these using the highest score on the relational \nmodel scales. In all, 97 (83%) supervisor relationships were characterized as \ninterdependent whereas 75 (55%) collegial relationships were thus classified. \nDiscrepancy valence and relationship type as moderators of associations between \nrelational discrepancies and emotions. We examined whether relational discrepancies \nwith supervisors and colleagues were uniquely associated with emotions and whether \nrelationship type moderated these associations. In addition, because of the hierarchical \nnature of relationships with supervisors, where there may be expectations that the \nsupervisor is \u201cbetter\u201d, it was possible that relational discrepancies would be more \nstrongly related to emotions when this expectation is violated (i.e., positive \ndiscrepancies). Based on Study 1 results, we expected that this would occur for ideal \nbut not ought relational discrepancies. Finally, we investigated whether in collegial \nrelationships relationship type moderates the associations between negative emotions \nand relational discrepancies in the manner proposed by RDT (i.e., weaker associations \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 23 \nin both AR and CS relationships) or whether weaker associations only occurred in CS \nrelationships.  \nWe performed two sets of hierarchical linear regression analyses. The first \nexamined moderation by relationship type and the second by discrepancy valence. We \nalso examined moderation of the discrepancy-emotion associations by relationship type \nin collegial relationships where the comparison was between CS and the other three \ntypes. As emotion scores were skewed, the analyses were conducted in conjunction \nwith optimal scaling. \nIdeal relational discrepancies were uniquely associated with dejection, \u03b2 = .23, p < \n.01, and ought relational discrepancies with agitation, \u03b2 = .23, p < .05, in collegial \nrelationships, and with agitation, \u03b2 = .33, p < .001, but not dejection, in supervisory \nrelationships. Neither the main effects of relationship type nor discrepancy valence \npredicted additional variance. However, the entry of the interaction terms on the third \nsteps, accounted for additional variance in relationships with supervisors, \u0394R2s < .04, p \n< .05, but not with colleagues. Both relationship type and discrepancy valence \nmoderated the impact of ideal and ought relational discrepancies on dejection and \nagitation, respectively, in supervisory relationships, \u03b2s < .23, p < .05.  \nSimple slope analyses revealed that ideal and ought relational discrepancies were \nassociated with dejection and agitation, respectively, when supervisory relationships \nwere exchange relationships (dejection, t (110) = 4.78, p < .05; agitation, t (110) = 4.80, \np < .05) but not when they were interdependent (dejection, t (110) = .44, ns; agitation, t \n(110) = .92, ns) (see Figure 5). Similarly, the associations occurred when participants \nreported they were better than supervisors at meeting relational guides (dejection, t \n(106) = 3.26, p < .05; agitation, t (110) = 4.06, p < .05) but not when they were worse \n(dejection, t (110) = .87, ns; agitation, t (110) = .79, ns) (see Figure 6). \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 24 \nThe moderation by relationship type in supervisory relationships is consistent with \nRDT predictions and the results of Studies 1 and 2. Similarly, the discrepancy valence \nmoderation effect in these relationships was what we expected; being better, not worse, \nthan a supervisor is associated with negative emotions. Interestingly, this occurred not \nonly for ideal relational discrepancies, as in Study 1, but also for ought relational \ndiscrepancies. Thus, in these hierarchical relationships when a supervisor does not \nmeet either relational guide, whether it entails either \u201cgrowth\u201d or \u201csurvival\u201d needs (Shah \n& Higgins, 1997), relational discrepancies are associated with negative emotions, \npossibly because supervisors control positive and negative outcomes for supervisees.  \nThe failure to find a moderating impact of relationship type on discrepancy-\nemotion associations for colleagues, although inconsistent with RDT propositions, was \nnot unexpected. This suggested that our argument about the problematic nature of \nacknowledging hierarchy among colleagues in workplace relationships may be correct. \nWe tested this by recoding relationship type in collegial relationships (CS relationships \ncoded -1 and the other three types were coded +1) and conducting two additional \nanalyses.  \nThe results did not change for associations with dejection. However, for agitation, \nthe entry of the interaction term on the third step accounted for additional variance, \u03b2 = \n.39, \u0394R2chn = .03, p < .05. In CS relationships, ought relational discrepancies were \nunrelated to agitation, t (110) = .87, ns, whereas in AR, EM, or MP relationships they \nwere, t (110) = 3.36, p < .05 (see Figure 7).  \nThus, in collegial relationships characterized by communality, ought relational \ndiscrepancies are not associated with negative emotions whereas ideal relational \ndiscrepancies are. This result suggests that individuals who perceive differences with \ntheir colleagues in regard to growth needs feel more dejected. This makes sense in the \nspecific context of organizations: an individual wanting more (or less) growth cannot \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 25 \nnecessarily achieve this through collegial action as individual aspirations are typically \nmet by senior staff, not colleagues. However, individuals in team-like CS relationships \nare not agitated when they contribute different amounts to survival needs than a \ncolleague, whereas individuals who acknowledge that the relationship is hierarchical \n(i.e., an AR relationship) are more likely to be agitated when larger relational \ndiscrepancies exist.  \nTogether, these results indicate that, consistent with RDT propositions, relational \ndiscrepancies are associated with negative emotions experienced in workplace \nrelationships with supervisors and colleagues. Again, ideal relational discrepancies were \nuniquely associated with dejection and ought relational discrepancies with agitation.  \nThese associations were moderated by relationship type and discrepancy valence \nin supervisory relationships. Consistent with Study 1 and 2 results, for individuals who \nacknowledged the interdependent nature of this relationship, relational discrepancies \nwere not associated with negative emotions. However, in exchange relationships they \nwere. In addition, because supervisors are expected to be better at meeting relational \nguides, when this expectation was violated, discrepancies were associated with \nnegative emotions.  \nIn the case of collegial relationships where there are no assumed hierarchies, \nconsistent with predictions and Study 2 results, discrepancy valence did not moderate \nassociations. Moreover, in these relationships, relationship type (i.e., interdependence \nvs. exchange) did not moderate discrepancy-emotion associations in the same way as \nin Studies 1 and 2. Rather, only in communal relationships were ought relational \ndiscrepancies unrelated to agitation. However, ideal relational discrepancies were \nrelated to dejection regardless of relationship type, suggesting that survival needs \namong colleagues can be addressed in communal relationships whereas growth needs \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 26 \ncannot. This highlights the importance of formal structures within organizations that \nprovide specific rewards in terms of performance and growth.  \n \nGeneral Discussion and Conclusions \nThe present studies tested two RDT propositions; that discrepancies in the extent \nto which individuals believe they and their partners are meeting ideal relational guides \nare uniquely associated with dejection whereas perceived discrepancies with ought \nrelational guides are uniquely associated with agitation, and that relationship type \nmoderates these associations, with weaker associations occurring in interdependent \nrelationships than in exchange relationships. The studies also examined the moderating \nrole of discrepancy valence and the effects of hierarchical relationships in the workplace \nwhere this has consequences outside the relationship. \nRDT is the first theory to propose that different types of perceived discrepancies \nwith relational guides are associated with specific types of emotions. Other models (e.g., \nthe ideal standards model, Simpson et al., 2001) specify that discrepancies, regardless \nof the standard used to evaluate a relational partner or the relationship, are related to \nnegative affect generally. Drawing on SDT (Higgins, 1987), RDT proposes that ideal \nrelational discrepancies are uniquely associated with dejection and ought relational \ndiscrepancies are uniquely related with agitation.  \nThis proposition was confirmed in all three studies, although in Study 3 \nassociations occurred in particular ways that were consistent with the nature of a \nworkplace. Moreover, in Study 1, associations occurred when those with personal and \npartner\u2019s personal discrepancies were statistically controlled. Taken together, our results \nprovide clear evidence for the proposed differential associations of relational \ndiscrepancies with emotions proposed by RDT.  \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 27 \nThe proposed moderating effects of relationship type, were, for the most part, \nfound. Stronger associations between relational discrepancies and emotions were found \nin exchange relationships than in interdependent relationships in a range of \nrelationships (Study 1), in friendships (Study 2), and in supervisory relationships (Study \n3). Consistent with our speculations about relationships where the acknowledgment of \nhierarchy may be problematic, this was not found in collegial relationships (Study 3). \nRather discrepancy-emotion associations were only attenuated in CS relationships. In \naddition, in friendships moderation was only partial, with relational discrepancies still \nassociated with emotions in interdependent relationships.  \nAlthough not inconsistent with RDT\u2019s propositions, this finding is interesting. This \nmay be a function of relationship investment. With greater investment, individuals might \nbe sensitive to relational discrepancies, regardless of how the relationship is viewed. \nAlternatively, it is possible that the types of attributes and qualities that are part of \nfriendship relational guides are those which have greater consequences. For example, \nfriends provide emotional support during difficult times (Fehr, 2004; Stanton-Salazar & \nSpina, 2005). Because of this, inequalities in such attributes may remain problematic in \nall relationships, regardless of their type.  \nWe also speculated that, consistent with Shah and Higgins\u2019 (1997) findings, \nassociations with ought relational discrepancies may be less susceptible to moderation \nthan those with ideal relational discrepancies. Mixed evidence for this was found. In \ncollegial relationships, moderation only occurred for ought relational discrepancies in CS \nrelationships. We argued that this could be understood by considering the implications \nof formally acknowledging hierarchy in relationships where outcomes are controlled by \nindividuals outside the relationship and by how survival and growth needs are met in \nthese situations. As the ought guide represents necessary survival needs (Shah & \nHiggins), these can be met in relationships that emphasize communality rather than \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 28 \ndifference, thus ameliorating associated agitation. However, as individuals\u2019 growth \nneeds in the workplace are dependent on recognition by more senior staff, viewing the \nrelationship as communal does not ameliorate associated dejection.  \nFinally, we explored moderation by discrepancy valence. In Study 1, moderation of \nideal discrepancy-dejection associations, independent of the impact of relational mode, \noccurred. We argued that this likely reflected the sampling of relationships involving \nassumed hierarchies, like the supervisory relationships sampled in Study 3, in which \nmoderation of associations with both discrepancy types were found. When there is an \nexpectation that a partner will be better than oneself, being better is associated with \nnegative emotions. The failure to find this moderation in Study 2 in friendships and in \ncollegial relationships in Study 3 likely reflects the fact that these relationships are \nassumed to be non-hierarchical. Thus, consistent with our arguments based on equity \ntheory (Walster et al., 1973), in these relationships discrepancy valence does not \nmoderate discrepancy-emotion associations. \nThese studies have some limitations. First, they are correlational, so provide no \nevidence for causal links between relational discrepancies and emotions. Only an \nexperimental design in which individuals are led to believe that they and a relational \npartner are better or worse at achieving a relational guide would provide clear evidence \nof a causal link. Similarly, RDT proposes that psychologically transforming an exchange \nrelationship into one characterized by interdependence reduces the impact of relational \ndiscrepancies. This dynamic resolution could not be observed in the present cross-\nsectional studies. A prospective longitudinal design is required to investigate whether \nsuch transformations occur in relationships when relational partners are confronted with \nrelational discrepancies. Finally, although we investigated a range of relationships, our \nparticipants were students who may have had little commitment to some of the \nrelationships sampled. The propositions of RDT, thus, require examination in committed \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 29 \nrelationships, such as romantic relationships or relationships in the workplace of those \nemployed full-time.  \nThese limitations aside, the current results have implications. First, as the two \nclusters of negative emotions investigated were differentially associated with relational \ndiscrepancies, they suggest possible mechanisms whereby these emotions are \nexperienced in relationships. We suggest that future research could profitably consider \nspecific emotion types when investigating other types of discrepancies. For example, \nour results suggest that discrepancies between individuals\u2019 views of their relationship \npartners with respect with ideal standards should be associated with dejection-related \nemotions, a proposal originally made by Higgins (1987), not just lower relationship \nquality (Campbell et al., 2001). Similarly, the moderation by relationship type suggests \nthat viewing relationships as interdependent may alleviate negative emotions when \nthere are discrepancies with ideal standards. Finally, the results concerning discrepancy \nvalence suggest that assumed hierarchies are important. Future research could \nexamine how viewing relationships in particular ways, including assuming a hierarchical \nstructure, moderate the associations of beliefs about how individuals are with respect to \nrelational guides or standards with relationship outcomes, including emotions.   \nIn summary, these studies provide evidence for two basic RDT propositions. They \nsuggest that RDT may be useful for understanding why different types of emotions are \nexperienced in relationships and when these emotions are or are not experienced. \nThese propositions involve relationship cognitions, specifically what individuals want and \nbelieve they should be like in their relationships, and individuals\u2019 evaluations of \nthemselves and their relationship partners with respect to these. Investigation of \nrelational discrepancies is likely to increase our understanding of the role these \ncognitions and evaluations play in relationships.  \n              Relational discrepancies and emotion  \n 30 \nAcknowledgments \nWe thank Nick Haslam, Jennifer Whelan, Ying-yi Hong, and four anonymous \nreviewers for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this article.

All \ncalculated indices of reliability are estimates of the true reliability and are lower-bound \nestimates. The most accurate estimate is, therefore, the highest. Guttman (1945) \noutlined six different ways of estimating reliability, including coefficient alpha his third \nlower bound estimate of reliability. The use of his best estimate, \u03bb, did not become \nroutine, however, because of the complexity of calculation (which is no longer a \nproblem). Traub (1994), in a review of reliability estimation, recommended that should \ncoefficient \u03bb be used in preference to coefficient \u03b1. \n2Optimal scaling (Young, De Leeuw, & Takane, 1976), as implemented in the \ncategorical regression procedure available in SPSS, is a procedure that transforms \nvariables in a manner that optimizes their relationships with other variables. This \nprocedure can capitalize on unique features in the data, leading to overfitting of any \nmodel. However, this is less likely to happen when there are moderate numbers of \ncases per variable and when data were assumed to be ordinal, which was the case \nhere and in the two subsequent studies. We further restricted this possibility by \nconstraining transformations to be smooth as well as increasing (i.e., \u2018spline-ordinal\u2019; \nWinsberg & Ramsay, 1980). The procedure standardizes all variables (i.e., they have \na mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). \n \n"}
