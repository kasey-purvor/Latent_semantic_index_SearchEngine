One issue is how best to equip trainee science \nteachers with the scientific SMK required for teaching, given evidence that possession of \u201cgood\u201d \nSMK influences teacher effectiveness positively (Abell, 2007, Geddis, et al, 1993; Lederman et \nal, 1994). This paper contributes to the discussion by offering perspectives from pre-service \nscience teachers\u201f (\u201ctrainees\u201d) experiences of training on an intensive, full-time course taking \nplace over an extended academic year. Specifically, this paper explores the extent to which \ntrainees\u201f subject matter knowledge (SMK) in science influences their self-confidence for \nteaching: trainees are graduates in specific science disciplines, such as biology, chemistry, \nphysics, astronomy, geology and others, but are required to teach all sciences to 11-14s while \ntraining and, often, while working in UK state-funded secondary schools. An investigation of \nsources employed by trainee science teachers to develop their SMK for teaching is reported, \ntogether with the potential impact SMK may have on confidence in relation to their classroom \npractice. The study thus contributes to discussion of the role SMK plays in teacher development.  \n \nThe work also contributes to the ongoing debate as to whether science should be split into its \ninternal disciplines for teaching purposes. By way of illustration, discussion is ongoing in the UK, \nfor example, as to whether or not physics should be taught by specialist physicists, chemistry by \nchemists and biology by biologists. For example, a lobbying group, the Campaign for Science \nand Engineering in the UK (CaSE) argues: \n \n\u201cChildren need to be taught by specialist [science] teachers. Teachers\u201f qualifications predict \nteaching quality and are the second greatest predictor of performance in physics after pupil \nability\u201d (CaSE Opinion Forum, May 2007)  \n \nSimilarly, the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), a professional organisation representing \nchemists internationally, states:  \n \n\u201cThe best teachers are those who have specialist subject knowledge and a real passion and \nenthusiasm for the subject they teach\u2026. The RSC believes that young people deserve to be \ntaught the sciences by subject specialists\u201d (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2004)  \n \nThese views are set against a factual background showing considerable imbalance in the \nproportions of science teachers with physics, chemistry and biology degrees. A 2006 UK \nGovernment report showed that 25% of UK science teachers (in a sample of 2756) hold degrees \nin biology or biology-related subjects, compared to 16% with chemistry degrees and 10% with \nphysics degrees. Of the remainder, 47% hold degrees in other science subjects or possess \nteaching qualifications in general science, while 2% have no science degree (Moor, Jones, \nJohnson, Martin, Cowell and Bojke, 2006). Social status also plays a part: in schools with higher \nthan average examination results and lower than average numbers of children receiving free \n 3 \nschool meals (a standard indicator of high social need) more science teachers held specialist \ndegrees in physics, chemistry and biology (Moor et al, 2006).  \n \nHence, establishing factors shaping how trainee science teachers teach within and outside their \nspecialist subjects would contribute to enhancing science teacher education.  \n \nThe study is situated in the Shulman paradigm in which subject matter knowledge (SMK) is \nperceived as separate from but essential to teachers\u201f pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). \nShulman (1986a, b) proposed that teachers \u201ctransform\u201d SMK for their students using PCK, a \npowerful model that has been re-interpreted widely (for example, Marks, 1990; Magnusson et al, \n1999; Carlsen, 1999).  \n \nThis paper takes the view that in describing a lesson as \u201csuccessful\u201d, the teacher\u201fs ability to \ntransform SMK is significant. Evidence presented below shows that trainee science teachers\u201f \nperceptions of their teaching as \u201csuccessful\u201d varies: some appear to consider a lesson as a \n\u201csuccess\u201d when they transmit knowledge, expressing confidence in the sense of personal \nsurvival when they understand the SMK for a specific lesson and can answer subject-related \nquestions. Others take a \u201ctransforming\u201d approach, perceiving \u201csuccess\u201d as finding good activities \nthat help children learn, placing personal mastery of SMK as a secondary concern. Trainees\u201f \ndevelopment of SMK for personal \u201csurvival\u201d or \u201ctransformation\u201d may vary according to whether \nteaching takes place within and outside subject specialism. Given the accepted wisdom that \nscience teachers teach their specialisms most successfully, a reasonable hypothesis is that \nwithin specialism lessons would generate fewer trainees relying on \u201csurvival\u201d and more \n\u201ctransformation\u201d. Data are presented that contradict this, suggesting that in the initial stages at \nleast, some trainees were more confident and taught more successful lessons when teaching \noutside their specialist subjects.  \n \n \nThe English and Welsh initial teacher education context \n \nThe study took place in a University in northern England, using trainees attending an initial \nteacher education (ITE) course, the \u201cPostgraduate Certificate in Education\u201d (PGCE). Obtaining a \nPGCE constitutes the major route into secondary school teaching. The PGCE is an intensive \nprogramme requiring nine months of full-time study from September \u2013 June. The course \ncombines school-based practice (24 weeks) and Higher Education Institution (HEI)-based work \n(12 weeks). All participants are graduates with a Bachelor\u201fs degree in a subject linked closely to \na National Curriculum (DfES, 2004) subject. In science, trainees\u201f degree subjects dictate their \nteaching subject specialisms of chemistry, physics, or biology. A majority of trainees have \nbackgrounds in biology or biology-related subjects, and little or no post-16 education in either \nphysics and\/or chemistry. Trainees\u201f minimum age is 21, so at least five years and for many, ten \nyears have passed since these sciences were studied.  \n \nThe National Curriculum for science stipulates the content of 11-16 science courses taught in \nstate-funded secondary schools. Pupils\u201f learning is measured by tests taken at age 14 and 16. \nHence, teaching divides into topics for 11-14s (Key Stage 3) and 14-16s (Key Stage 4). To \ndeliver the curriculum, school science teachers write \u201cSchemes of Work\u201d (SoWs), giving precise \n 4 \ndetails of lessons, often based on published materials and textbooks. Teachers are expected to \nteach all aspects of science to 11-14s and, frequently, 14-16s regardless of their subject \n\u201cspecialism\u201d; hence, this is also expected of trainees. During the school-based practice, trainees \nteach 11-16s and, exceptionally, 16-18s in two different schools located within 50 miles (80 km) \nof the university. Trainees are often expected to follow schools\u201f defined schemes of work, but \nmay have freedom to develop their own lessons or parts of lessons.  Trainees participated in \nforty-five hours of HEI-based sessions to develop their SMK for teaching specific science topics \nat Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4. Topics included electricity, forces, chemical reactions, energy, \nwaves, ecosystems, the genome, Earth and space, substances and investigations. Materials for \nuse when teaching were provided with details of experiments and potential misconceptions. \nTrainees were introduced to science education research through these sessions and also by \npreparing a written assignment.  \n \nLiterature review \n \nThe role of SMK  \n \nThe notion that possession of good SMK is an essential component of effective teaching has \nbeen demonstrated in a number of research studies, including those by Shulman (1986b, 1987) \nand those reviewed by Abell (2007) and Gess-Newsome (1999). A useful summary of the \nposition and value ascribed to SMK in teaching is provided by Carr\u00e9 (1998):-  \n \n\u201cThe more you know about science, the more you will be able to provide a framework to help \nchildren think in scientific ways; in so doing you will also represent the subject with integrity\u201d (p \n103)  \n \nHashweh\u201fs (1987) work with six experienced science teachers offers evidence for this. He found \nthat \u201cknowledgeable\u201d teachers had more detailed knowledge of the topic being taught, \ndemonstrated wider knowledge of the same subject, and were more readily able to relate a topic \nto other aspects of the subject. More specifically, Hashweh reported that possessing good SMK \npositively affected a range of aspects considered essential to good science teaching. These \nincluded teachers\u201f abilities to transform material for delivery in lessons by planning novel \nactivities and their responses to critical incidents in the classroom. Knowledgeable teachers \nposed higher cognitive level questions while \u201cunknowledgeable\u201d teachers asked for recall and \nrelied heavily on textbook information. Sanders, Borko and Lockard (1993) followed the teaching \nof three experienced secondary science teachers working within and outside specialism. \nAlthough general pedagogical practices were similar in both domains, when teaching within \nspecialism teachers talked less, involved students more and selected \u201criskier\u201d activities.  \n \nAn exploration of research relating to the precise role played by SMK in teacher development \nyields a varied picture. De Jong (2000) and van Driel et al (2002) provide evidence that good \nSMK helps trainees be more readily aware of students\u201f difficulties, a key aspect of Shulman\u201fs \nmodel for PCK. In a highly specialised but extremely thorough study, Davis (2003) indicates that \ngood SMK helps trainees select appropriate instructional strategies, also a feature of Shulman\u201fs \nPCK model. Thirdly, Markic et al (2006) indicate that SMK contributes to teachers\u201f orientations \ntowards teaching and beliefs about science. All these factors are likely to vary according to \n 5 \nwhether trainees are working within and outside their subject specialisms \u2013 for example, a \nphysics specialist teaching biology topics may find it more difficult to select appropriate \ninstructional strategies and be less aware of students\u201f difficulties than a biologist teaching the \nsame topic. As an indication of the possible effects of outside specialism teaching, Carlsen\u201fs \n(1993)  study of four trainee biology teachers found that when teaching an unfamiliar topic, \nparticipants tended to talk more often, for longer periods of time, asked questions frequently and \nrelied heavily on low cognitive level questions.  \n \nMisconceptions about science concepts are a significant concern for science education \nresearchers. In terms of educating science teachers, learning outcomes related to \nmisconceptions achieved by trainees may differ, depending on whether a lesson is being taught \nwithin or outside specialism. A biology lesson taught by a physicist may be less satisfactory than \nthe same lesson taught by a biology specialist, as the physics trainee may have similar \nmisconceptions to the children being taught. Sanders (1993) explored the views of South African \nbiology teachers about respiration, finding that many seemed to hold misconceptions about \nbasic principles within this topic. However, the study did not distinguish between specialist and \nnon-specialist biology teachers.  \n \nBesides these specifically SMK related issues, other research evidence indicates that \nspecialised support helps trainee science teachers develop positively (Luft et al, 2003). In the \npresent system, each trainee teacher is provided with an experienced science teacher as a \n\u201cmentor\u201d to assist them on teaching practice, as well as a university tutor. Mentors help trainees \ngain access to additional support within school science departments and hold regular (usually \nweekly) one-to-one meetings with trainees. Despite mentors\u201f and tutors\u201f good intentions, Youens \nand McCarthy (2007) found that trainees tend not to use mentors and university tutors as \nsources for SMK development, due to awareness of their roles in assessing progress. Trainees \nthink that asking for help may imply they are failing. This perception may impact on trainees\u201f \npreparation for and subsequent success in within and outside specialism teaching.  \n \nScience teachers\u2019 perceptions of success, self- confidence and self-efficacy  \n \nThe influence of specialized support on teachers\u201f confidence or \u201cefficacy\u201d has been investigated \nby Hoy and Spero (2005), who showed that positive effects are seen where this is effective. \nHowever, Youens and McCarthy\u201fs (2007) work shows that these may be negated in situations \nwhere a dual role is perceived \u2013mentors and university tutors are involved in reporting on \ntrainees\u201f progress, controlling whether they \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d,  as well as providing support. As \nmentioned above, the assessment role appears to dominate, as trainees forgo asking for \nsupport, in case this indicates weakness on their part. In which case, it would be valuable to \nknow what sources of SMK are used by trainee teachers and why these are selected, given that \nobvious collegial support is, at least by some, cast aside.  Further, any differences between SMK \nsources for within and outside specialism teaching may exist and these may impinge on \ntrainees\u201f success in teaching and perceptions of success.  \n \nThe role of support and teacher self-confidence emerged as factors influencing success in \nteaching science among nine novice primary school teachers studied by Appleton and Kindt \n(1999). This study makes an interesting and significant connection between weak subject matter \n 6 \nknowledge and self-confidence, reporting that teachers lacked confidence to teach science and \nthat this seemed to be associated with limited background knowledge (p 160). Teachers\u201f self-\nconfidence was negatively affected by believing that they had to be competent to answer \nchildren\u201fs subject-related questions.  In contrast to Youens and McCarthy\u201fs (2007) findings, once \nbeyond the bounds of a training experience, the teachers in this study found collegial support \nvaluable, providing, for example, the confidence to try new activities and teaching strategies and \nsupport for planning science teaching.   \n \nBorko, Lalik and Tomchin (1987) examined trainees\u201f conceptions of \u201csuccessful\u201d teaching, \ncomparing journal writings of \u201cstronger\u201d and \u201cweaker\u201d novice teachers. They found that although \ntrainees generally agreed about what constitutes \u201csuccessful\u201d teaching, differences were \nobserved regarding \u201cunsuccessful\u201d teaching. By \u201csuccessful\u201d, trainees indicated they meant \nusing creative and novel activities, generating a variety of experiences for their students. \nPreparation of lessons with these characteristics involved going beyond the prescribed \ncurriculum and associated tasks. Trainees emphasized trying out new ideas, maintaining pace \nand handling behaviour issues effectively. When describing \u201cunsuccessful\u201d lessons, weaker \ntrainees focused more on behaviour issues and planning, while stronger trainees focused on a \nlack of creativity on their part.  \n  \nTeachers\u201f beliefs about the potential influence of specific environmental factors on their science \nteaching were investigated by Lumpe, Haney and Czerniak (2000). These authors developed a \n\u201cContext Beliefs About Teaching Science\u201d (CBATS) instrument designed to assess the extent to \nwhich teachers beliefs about aspects of their work were positive or negative. They report that \nmore positive beliefs emerge among more experienced teachers, describing a majority as \nholding \u201crobust, modest and tenacious\u201d belief patterns (p 285). These sustain teachers when \nworking in frustrating circumstances, providing a structure that helps them function effectively in \nthe classroom. A minority were found to be \u201cvulnerable, fragile and self-doubting\u201d. The authors \ncomment that teaching may select against such weak profiles, and teachers possessing these \nbelief systems may leave the profession at an early stage.   \n \nGiven these previous studies, the possibility exists that trainees experience different levels of \nconfidence for teaching within and outside specialism, as well as using different sources to \ndevelop their SMK.  \n \nHypothesis and research questions  \n \nHence, this study investigates:  \n \n\u2022 What sources do trainee science teachers use for developing their subject matter \nknowledge for within and outside specialism teaching while on a ten month postgraduate \nteacher education course?  \n \n\u2022 To what extent is the confidence of trainee science teachers influenced by teaching within \nand outside their specialist subjects?   \n \n \n 7 \nMethodology  \n \nThe design of the study follows the tradition of interpretative and descriptive qualitative work \n(Merriam, 2002), although data were collected using both interviews and questionnaires. These \nmethods gave the best overview of trainees\u201f experiences, providing an insight into the widest \npossible range of opinions and views within this context. The interviews were designed to \nvalidate questionnaire responses.  \n \nData were analysed to characterise trainees\u201f attitudes and confidence relating to SMK for within \nand outside specialism teaching. Categories emerged from the data \u2013 a combination of \nresponses to open questions and Likert scale statements together with interview responses \nrevealed specific characteristics. These are discussed in detail below.  \n \nThe questionnaire  \nThe questionnaire, devised for this study (Appendix 1) comprised three probe types:-  \n \n Open questions (numbers 2 and 3) probed trainees\u201f sources of SMK for preparing \nscience topics for teaching within and outside their specialist subjects  \n \n A closed question (number 4) invited trainees to rank preferred sources of subject \nknowledge from a pre-prepared list  \n \n Four sets of paired statements explored trainees\u201f thinking about SMK and teacher \nconfidence using a five-point Likert scale. The pairs were named \u201cAttitude\u201d (A), \n\u201cPreference\u201d (P), \u201cConfidence\u201d(C) and \u201cHandling questions\u201d (H). For reference purposes, \nthese letters are shown against the statements in the questionnaire (Appendix 1).   \n \nThe components of the questionnaire were validated by discussion with colleagues.  \n \nIn addition, background information such as trainees\u201f education, age and gender were collected.  \n \nThe interviews   \nIndividual interviews of approximately 30 minutes each were conducted using a semi-structured \nprotocol. The interviews collected data relating to the topics trainees had taught; sources used to \ndevelop SMK needed for teaching within and outside specialism; trainees\u201f awareness of the \nimpact of their preparation on achievement of intended learning outcomes; and the extent to \nwhich their modes of subject matter knowledge acquisition and lesson preparation changed \nduring the PGCE course. \n \nQuestionnaires were administered in April 2006 and April 2007 after completion of all HEI-based \nsessions and towards the end of the main teaching placement. Interviews were conducted in \nJune 2006 and June 2007 when all parts of the course had been completed.   \n \nThe sample  \n \n 8 \nA total of 71 trainees completed the questionnaire. These comprised twenty-eight respondents \nfrom the 2005 \u2013 2006 cohort and forty-three from 2006 \u2013 2007. Maxima of forty (2005- 2006) \nand fifty-two (2006-2007) were possible \u2013 absences and fall-out from the course on the day of \ndata collection account for discrepancies. For reporting purposes, all respondents are treated as \none group \u2013 this is reasonable given that both cohorts had as identical experiences as possible. \n \nTwelve trainees were interviewed, divided 5:7 between the 2005- 2006 and 2006 \u2013 2007 \ncohorts. The trainees were volunteers, but care was taken to ensure participants were as far as \npossible representative of all respondents in terms of subject specialism, age and gender.  \n \nData analysis  \n \nEach questionnaire was given a code number. The same codes were used to identify \ninterviewees to check for triangulation of responses between interview and questionnaire data.  \n \nBackground information  \n \nTrainees\u201f background information was counted and used to generate the data in Table 1.  \n \nQuestionnaire  \n \nQuestionnaire responses were edited to establish the extent of completion and examined for any \ninaccuracies. All 71 trainees responded to the open questions, the closed question and paired \nstatements. Ten trainees mis-interpreted the ranking for the closed question (number 4 in \nAppendix 1) so their responses were excluded from the data (see Table 2, Total)  \n \nOpen question responses (questions 2 and 3) were coded by the researcher. A coding frame \nwas used to establish the range of responses offered. The same frame was applied to questions \n2 and 3 (see Appendix 1). Responses were grouped by:-  \n \n Trainees\u201f subject specialism (drawn from background information)  \n Trainees\u201f chosen topic  \n Trainees\u201f stated preparation strategy\/ies \n Other information provided by the trainee  \n \nResponses from two trainees who gave only general comments relating to their school \ncircumstances and no information about preparation strategies were excluded. Thus, Table 3 \npresents data from 69 trainees.  \n \nThe preparation strategies described were grouped into the categories shown in Table 3. Other \ninformation, most often about teaching, included phrases such as \u201ctried to break down the \ninformation into key sentences\u201d.  \n \nFor example, Question 2 required trainees to name topic they had taught within specialism and \ndescribe SMK preparation. Three biology specialists named \u201cMicrobes and Disease\u201d as their \ntopic. Two trainees cited \u201cknowledge from degree\u201d and one \u201cknowledge from own University \n 9 \nresearch\u201d.  These three responses appear in Table 3 as \u201cPrior knowledge from University \ndegree or job\u201d.  \n \nQuestion 3 required trainees to name a topic they had taught outside specialism and describe \nSMK preparation. Two biology specialists and one physics specialist named \u201cChemical \nreactions\u201d. Their SMK strategies, with Table 3 \u201cSMK source\u201d in parentheses were: two cited \nteacher involvement (School colleague or other trainee teacher), two used the internet (Internet), \ntwo used school textbooks (Textbooks, school resource packs, teacher materials), one looked at \nan examination paper for the year group (Formal documentation), and two tried out experiments \nprior to the lessons (Other source).  \n \nResponses to the closed question, number 4 were counted and recorded against the suggested \nstrategies. These data are presented in Table 2.   \n \nThe paired statement analysis was done by counting systematically through all the responses, \nnoting the code numbers and background information for each respondent for each pair. Scores \n1 and 2 were summarised as \u201cAgree\u201d while 4 and 5 became \u201cDisagree\u201d. This generated a series \nof sub-groups for each response pair (see p 15 \u2013 18). The background characteristics were \nexamined and compared with the data for the whole cohort (Table 1). Where marked differences \nwere observed, these were noted in the results.  \n \nFor example, in response to the \u201cPreferences\u201d pair, 8 trainees responded \u201cagree\u201d (Likert score 2 \non the questionnaire) or \u201cstrongly agree\u201d (1) to \u201cI prefer to teach topics in my specialism\u201d and \nwere \u201cneutral\u201d (3) or disagreed (4, 5) with \u201cI am pleased to teach topics in all areas of science\u201d. \nAnalysis of the background information for this group showed that these respondents divided \nequally into male and female, had an average age of 29 and all except one held degrees at the \nstandard of 2:2 or better. This sub-group expressed \u201cspecialist\u201d views, but revealed no \ncharacteristics that were markedly different from the whole group. Hence, the existence of the \ngroup was noted (see p 14) but no further comments could be made.  \n \nAnalysis of the \u201cConfidence\u201d pair showed a sub-group of 14 trainees who disagreed with \u201cI am \nless confident when I teach outside my specialism\u201d (Likert score 4 or 5) and agreed with \u201cI do not \nneed to teach my specialism to feel confident as a teacher\u201d (1 or 2). These trainees had two \nbackground characteristics that differed from those of the whole group. Six were aged 31 or \nover, comprising a significant proportion of the 16 trainees in this age group shown in Table 1. \nTwo others were aged 28 and 29. Four trainees (28%) were aged 21 -25 compared to 58% of \nthe whole cohort. Thus, the overall age profile of this sub-group is higher than that of the whole \ncohort. Ten of the fourteen, 71% were female (61% for the whole cohort). Seven held degrees in \nthe two highest classifications \u201c1st\u201d and \u201c2:1\u201d, a figure similar to that for the whole cohort. \nConsequently, comments to this effect are made in the results section (p 15).  \n \nInterviews  \n \nInterviewees were volunteers who knew the researcher as a PGCE course tutor. To ensure \ncomparability of responses, a standardised set of questions (LeCompte and Preissle, 1993) was \nprepared (Appendix 2). This was sent in advance to participants by email. No potential \n 10 \ninterviewee refused to attend having seen the questions. Interviewees were invited to bring \ndocumentation such as lesson plans and lesson evaluations for discussion. These were \nconsidered once responses to the standard questions were concluded.  \n \n Five questions triangulated responses to questionnaire questions (Q) and\/or paired statements \n(P, followed by reference letter) as follows:-  \n \nInterview  Q1 supports  questionnaire  Q1  \n  Q2     Q4 \n  Q3      Q2, 3  PA, PC   \n  Q4      Q2, 3   PP, PH \n  Q5      PP, PH \n \nThe purpose of question 6 was to illustrate the extent to which trainees\u201f practice had altered \nduring the PGCE course and to serve as a means of validation: two months had elapsed \nbetween collection of questionnaire and interview data. Indicative responses to this question are \nprovided on p 23. Ten trainees referred only to their planning and preparation \u201cspeeding up\u201d as \nthe course proceeded, noting no other changes. Two trainees (see p 23) specifically said no \nchanges had occurred.  \n \nInterviews lasted about 30 minutes each. Follow-up questions were posed in addition to the \nstandard ones where necessary to illuminate or clarify answers or to draw out more information \nwhen a trainee seemed shy or reluctant. Hence the format could in practice be described as \n\u201csemi-structured\u201d, as these varied according to the interviewee.  \n \nThe recorded interviews were transferred to ATLAS for analysis. Pseudonyms were devised for \neach trainee at this stage. A transcript was prepared from each interview. After transcription \ntrainees were matched against their questionnaires. Consistently excellent correspondence \ncould be ascertained between interview and questionnaire responses. To illustrate this, two \nquestionnaire response profiles are provided:-  \n \n \nMatthew, aged 38, Male, Physicist, 1st class degree   \n \nQuestionnaire Q2 response:- Light \u2013 I used subject revision guides to establish what the content \nshould be. My subject knowledge was already adequate  \n \nQuestionnaire Q3 response:- Cells \u2013 I read revision guides and subject books.  \n \nQuestionnaire Q4 response:- My strategies were the same apart from I researched in more \ndepth the cells topic  \n \nPaired statement responses:-  \n \nAttitudes:  Agree with \u201cI enjoy learning\u2026\u201d  Disagree with \u201cI find it difficult\u2026\u201d  \nPreference:   Agree with \u201cI prefer to teach\u2026\u201d  Disagree with \u201cI am pleased to teach\u2026\u201d  \n 11 \nConfidence:  Agree with  \u201cI am less confident ..\u201d Disagree with \u201cI do not need to teach\u2026\u201d  \nHandling questions: Agree with \u201cI can handle..\u201d  Disagree with \u201cI am nervous\u2026\u201d  \n \nMatthew\u201fs responses indicate he may be anxious about teaching outside specialism (see p 17). \nHis views about outside specialism teaching expressed at interview are stated on p 18.  \n \n \n \nSimon, aged 28, Male, Chemistry, 2:2 degree with PhD  \n \nQuestionnaire Q2 response: Particles \u2013 Looked at textbook, school\u201fs scheme of work, resources \nfrom HEI-based session, internet \n \nQuestionnaire Q3 response: classification \u2013 Same as above (ie as Q2)  \n \nQuestionnaire Q4 response:  I used [the] same strategies because [I] drew on large area of \nresources and ideas. [I] prepared in the same way for topics I know about and topics I don\u201ft.  \n \nPaired statement responses:-  \n \nAttitudes:  Agree with \u201cI enjoy learning\u2026\u201d         Disagree with \u201cI find it difficult\u2026\u201d  \nPreference:   Disagree with \u201cI prefer to teach\u2026\u201d       Agree with \u201cI am pleased to teach\u2026\u201d  \nConfidence:   Disagree with  \u201cI am less confident ..\u201d Agree with \u201cI do not need to teach\u2026\u201d  \nHandling questions: Agree with \u201cI can handle..\u201d        Disagree with \u201cI am nervous\u2026\u201d  \n  \nSimon\u201fs responses indicate he is confident teaching all aspects of science (see p 17). His views \nabout teaching outside specialism are on p 20.  \n \n \nResults  \n \nTrainees\u2019 backgrounds  \n \n[Insert Table 1 about here] \n \nTable 1 provides information about the gender distribution, degree class1, age and science \nsubject specialism of the respondents.  \n \nThe samples were representative of the full cohorts, being skewed approximately 60:40 towards \nfemales. Most trainees were born in North East England and Scotland. Four trainees born \n                                            \n1\n Degree class is divided into four categories of \u201cHonours\u201d: the highest achieving students, usually around 10% of a \ncohort, are awarded \u201cFirst\u201d (1\nst\n) class degrees. These students normally score around 70 \u2013 75% in their final \nexaminations. About 40% are placed in the next category, \u201cUpper Second\u201d (2:1) class. About 30% gain \u201cLower \nSecond\u201d (2:2) class degrees.  About 20% are awarded \u201cThird\u201d class honours. Those whose work is deemed not of \nHonours standard may be awarded \u201cOrdinary\u201d or \u201cPass\u201d degrees.  \n 12 \noutside the UK were classified formally as \u201cethnic minority\u201d trainees. Eight participants who \ncompleted the questionnaire did not complete the successfully for different reasons.  \n \nDegree subject is the key indicator used to decide trainees\u201f science specialism as physics, \nchemistry or biology. Trainees\u201f degree subjects are broad-ranging: data indicate that about 65% \nof respondents were \u201cbiology specialists\u201d, holding degrees in biology (16%) or \u201cbiology-related\u201d \nsubjects (49%). The latter included graduates in genetics, ecology, biomedical sciences, aquatic \n\/ marine bioscience and physiology. Nine (12%) trainees held degrees in chemistry, while a \nfurther eight (11%) were classified as \u201cchemistry-related\u201d; this group included biochemists, \ngeologists, environmental chemists and pharmacologists.  Eight trainees held degrees physics \nor physics-related subjects, such as astronomy, mechanical engineering and optometry.  \n \nDegree class is widely respected as an indicator of the quality of trainees\u201f science specialist \nknowledge. These trainees are regarded as \u201cacademically well-qualified\u201d: Table 1 shows that \nabout 54% held Upper Second (2:1) or First Class (1st) honours degrees, these being the two \nhighest degree classifications possible, while a further twenty-one held Lower Second (2:2) class \ndegrees. Thus, overall around 83% of respondents held \u201cgood\u201d degrees. Nineteen also held \nMasters or Doctorate qualifications in science. One held a Masters degree in Law. Possession of \na \u201cgood\u201d degree means that a trainee would respond correctly to GCSE (General Certificate of \nSecondary Education: the Key Stage 4 examination taken at age 16) questions in their \nspecialism.  \n \nTrainees\u201f average age was 27. Around 58% were aged 21 \u2013 25. For this sub-group, teaching is \ntheir first career choice. The remainder comprise those changing career, such as post-doctoral \nscientists, science graduates who have worked in non-science fields and parents returning to \nwork.  \n \nPreferred sources of SMK for teaching  \n \n[Insert Table 2 about here] \n \nIn responding to the questionnaire, trainees ranked a pre-prepared list of possible SMK sources \nfrom 1(most preferred) to 10 (least preferred). These data indicate strong preference for school-\nbased or school-oriented material, reliance on note-taking and reading. HEI-based teaching \nsessions, misconceptions and science education research literature received low rankings. Ten \ntrainees did not provide sufficient information to be included.  \n \nSMK sources for teaching within and outside specialism  \n \nOpen questions prompted trainees to choose one topic each from within and outside their \nspecialisms that they had taught and describe sources used to prepare the SMK required. Table \n3  summarises the SMK sources trainees cited in their responses. The figures represent the \nnumbers of trainees citing each source. Most trainees cited more than one.  \n \n[INSERT TABLE  3  ABOUT HERE] \n \n 13 \nWithin specialism teaching SMK preparation  \nTable 3 indicates four main sources of SMK - the internet, textbooks, prior knowledge and formal \ndocumentation \u2013 were used for within specialism teaching preparation.  Comments emphasised \ntrainees\u201f sense of \u201calready knowing\u201d the topic, implying little work was needed, for example:-   \n \n\u201cI knew it and only had to skip through the Key Stage 3 revision book, ie. 5 mins\u201d \n(Chemist)  \n \n\u201cForces \u2013 looked at QCA2, school and exploring science SoWs and tests to come up \nwith learning objectives and teaching scheme\u2026 otherwise did not need to think about \nown subject knowledge\u201d (Physicist)  \n \nThree trainees explicitly stated they consulted no additional SMK sources, relying entirely on \nprior knowledge.  \n \nThe 19 trainees citing \u201ctextbooks\u201d regarded these as low level material, of whom six described \nthis choice as \u201cbackground reading\u201d, or \u201crefreshing knowledge\u201d, for example:-  \n \n\u201cCells. Background reading which brought back what I already knew \u2026 I already felt \nquite confident with the topic\u201d (Biologist)  \n \nFive used revision guides (classified as \u201cother) to check the level of knowledge required by their \nstudents, for example:-  \n \n\u201cLight \u2013 I used subject revision guides to establish what the content should be. My \nsubject knowledge was already adequate\u201d (Physicist)  \n \nFive trainees believed they had the necessary subject knowledge, but wanted to find good \nresources or explanations to use in teaching, for example:-  \n \n\u201cAcids and alkalis \u2013 [I] looked at how to describe ideas using simple vocabulary\u201d  \n(Chemist)  \n \n\u201cVariation \u2013 I.. researched for novel activities\u2026.\u201d (Biologist)  \n \nThese trainees seem aware of transforming SMK to pedagogical content knowledge (PCK).  \n \nTable 3 indicates that few trainees prepared for within specialism teaching by seeking \ncolleagues\u201f advice, consulting misconceptions or science education research literature or testing \nout practical experiments prior to lessons.  \n \nOutside specialism SMK preparation  \nTable 3 shows that a more intense pattern of SMK sources emerges for outside specialism \npreparation. School colleagues and textbooks were consulted by about half of respondents. The \n                                            \n2\n The QCA is the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the organisation responsible for setting examination \nstandards. The QCA has produced a scheme of work for teaching KS3 used by some schools. www.qca.org.uk  \n 14 \ninternet and formal documentation were also popular. The range of sources reflects trainees\u201f \nawareness of SMK weaknesses and perceived need for more detailed preparation, for example:-  \n \n\u201cElectromagnetic spectrum \u2013 [I] read around the subject and to a higher level than I \nwas required to teach. [I] prepared an extensive lesson plan with difficult concepts \nfully written out\u201d (Biologist)  \n \nThe role of school colleagues in helping trainees prepare for outside specialism teaching is \napparent, for example:-  \n \n\u201cEnvironments \u2013 had long conversations with other teachers\u2026\u201d (Physicist)  \n \n\u201cRadiation \u2013 [I] spoke to the physics teacher (he knows everything)\u201d (Biologist)  \n \n\u201cGravity and Space - \u2026.Teachers at school and technicians were very helpful\u201d (Chemist)  \n \nTrainees using textbooks did so to learn the information necessary, rather than to check the \nlevel of understanding required, for example:-  \n \n\u201cPaints and pigments \u2013 [I] read over student textbook then looked in A level book to \nimprove higher knowledge then researched on internet\u201d (Biologist)  \n \nThe increase in \u201cOther\u201d sources for outside specialism SMK arises from trainees stating that \nthey practiced experiments before lessons, or asked for help in setting up equipment.  \n \nComparing SMK sources for within and outside specialism teaching  \nTable 3 shows that about 50% of trainees actively seek colleagues\u201f advice in preparing outside \nspecialism lessons. SMK preparation for within specialism teaching is characterised by trainees \nrelying heavily on prior knowledge and not seeking advice or testing experiments prior to \nteaching.  \n \nAbout two-thirds of trainees expressed clear differences in their approaches to within and \noutside lesson preparation, for example:- \n \n\u201cMy biology topics are fairly clear in my mind and so I do not need to look at basic \nknowledge \u2026 with Chemistry I am not sure of my basic knowledge and must look \nat the topic as though I am teaching myself.\u201d (Biologist)  \n \n\u201cI needed to make sure I was prepared for any additional questions students may \nask\u201d (Biologist)  \n \nAbout ten trainees indicated that outside specialist subject lessons were sometimes \u201ceasier\u201d, for \nexample:-  \n \n\u201cNon-specialism takes longer [to prepare] but is sometimes easier to teach as \nyou don\u201ft have the same extent of knowledge\u201d (Biologist)  \n 15 \n \nThis response, found also at interview (see below, p 16) suggests that possession of too \nmuch subject matter knowledge could be problematic. Outside specialism teaching meant \nthat trainees taught what they learned, resulting in more clearly focused lessons than those \ntaught within specialism.  \n \nOther emerging issues relating to outside specialism teaching included one trainee who \nsought to avoid misconceptions:-  \n \n[Outside specialism] \u2013 emphasis on accuracy and avoidance of misconception \nperpetration\u201d (Biologist) \n \nand this trainee who explicitly stated she prepared to enhance her confidence:-  \n \n\u201c[I did] far more preparation for the physics topic to feel more secure and confident\u201d \n(Biologist)  \n \nTwo trainees stated specifically they used the same preparation method throughout, for \nexample:-  \n \n\u201cI used similar strategies as I find them most effective to refresh my knowledge and \nensure my understanding\u201d (Biologist).  \n \nThe extent to which trainees\u2019 confidence for teaching relies on subject matter knowledge  \n \n[Insert Table 4 about here]  \n \nTrainees\u201f responses to eight statements scored using a five-point Likert scale are summarised in \ntable 4. The statements were paired to permit exploration for consistencies in response patterns: \none pair each investigates trainees\u201f preference for teaching within and outside specialism; their \nconfidence for teaching; the extent to which trainees believe they can handle students\u201f \nquestions; and trainees\u201f attitudes towards SMK.  \n \nDetailed data relating to combinations of responses are presented below. For this purpose, the \nscale has been summarised to three points by adding \u201cstrongly agree\u201d  to \u201cagree\u201d and \u201cstrongly \ndisagree\u201d to  \u201cdisagree\u201d, with neutral in the centre.  The words \u201cagree\u201d and \u201cdisagree\u201d are used \nto express extremes. All 71 trainees responded to all statements.  \n \nPreferences for within and outside specialism teaching  \nTwo statements, \u201cI prefer to teach topics in my specialism\u201d (abbreviated to \u201cprefer specialism\u201d) \nand \u201cI am pleased to teach topics in all areas of science\u201d (abbreviated to \u201call science\u201d) assessed \ntrainees\u201f preferences. A trainee preferring in-specialism teaching may respond positively \n(strongly agree\/ agree) to the first statement and negatively (disagree\/ strongly disagree) to the \nsecond; vice versa for a trainee preferring to teach all sciences.  \n \n 16 \nTable 4 shows that around 56% (total of \u201cstrongly agree\u201d and \u201cagree\u201d) of respondents prefer to \nteach their specialism, while over 80% (total of \u201cstrongly agree\u201d  and \u201cagree\u201d) say they do not \nmind teaching all aspects of science. However, these data mask underlying response patterns. \nThese are analysed next. Four clear patterns emerge:-  \n \n32 (45%)    Trainees agreed with both statements                           \n15 (21%)   Trainees disagreed with \u201cprefer specialism\u201d and agreed with \u201call science\u201d  \n12 (17%)   Trainees were neutral to \u201cprefer specialism\u201d and agreed with \u201call science\u201d   \n8 (11%) Trainees agreed with \u201cprefer specialism\u201d  and disagreed or were neutral to \u201call \nscience\u201d                                                                                                    \n \nFour trainees\u201f responses did not fit these categories.  \n \nTrainees agreeing with both statements are not necessarily inconsistent \u2013 they may be saying \nthat although they prefer to teach within specialism, they are also pleased to teach all topics. \nThey can work on SMK and may enjoy this. Around 21% claim preference for teaching all \nscience topics. This group could be described as \u201cgeneralist\u201d in outlook. The twelve trainees \nneutral to the \u201cI prefer to teach\u2026\u201d statement could also be \u201cgeneralist\u201d, although they express \ntheir preference less strongly. Finally, a small sub-group of \u201cspecialists\u201d exists; these trainees \nexpress strong preference for within specialism teaching.  \n \n \n \nConfidence for teaching  \nThe statement pair exploring trainees\u201f confidence for teaching was \u201cI am less confident teaching \noutside my specialism\u201d (\u201cless confident outside\u201d) and \u201cI do not need to teach my specialism to \nfeel confident as a teacher\u201d (\u201cdon\u201ft need specialism\u201d). A trainee with good self-confidence may \nrespond negatively to the first statement (strongly disagree or disagree) and positively to the \nsecond. A more anxious trainee may state the reverse.  \n \nTable 4 shows that 53% respond \u201cstrongly agree\/ agree\u201d to \u201cless confident outside\u201d, while twelve \ndisagree. This significant minority express confidence in their ability to teach outside specialism. \nHowever, in a seemingly contradictory fashion, about two-thirds agree or strongly agree with \n\u201cDon\u201ft need specialism\u201d, implying that they can teach anything.  Closer inspection of underlying \nresponse combinations reveals these pairings:-  \n \n14 (21%)Trainees disagreed with \u201cless confident outside\u201d and agreed with or were neutral \nto \u201cdon\u201ft need specialism\u201d    \n    \n9 (12%) Trainees were neutral to \u201cless confident outside\u201d and agreed with \u201cdon\u201ft need \nspecialism\u201d       \n      \n25 (35%)Trainees agreed with both statements  \n     \n5  (7%)Trainees agreed with \u201cless confident outside\u201d and disagreed with \u201cdon\u201ft need \nspecialism\u201d                              \n 17 \n                                                              \n7  (10%)Trainees agreed with \u201cless confident outside\u201d and were neutral to \u201cdon\u201ft need \nspecialism\u201d                                                                                           \n         \nEleven trainees\u201f responses did not fit into these categories.  \n \nThe disagree \/ agree sub-group (14, 21%) could be labelled \u201csuper-confident\u201d, as they state that \noutside specialism teaching does not affect their confidence. Examining these trainees\u201f \nbackgrounds shows that seven have degrees in the highest two classes (1st or 2:1) or hold a \nhigher degree, while ten are female. The average age is 31: six are aged 31 or over. Tentatively, \n\u201csuper-confident\u201d trainees could be academically well-qualified females older than the average \nage of the cohort.  \n \nThose agreeing with both statements (25, 35%) seem to offer contradictory statements. Without \ngoing back to every trainee, it is difficult to comment as to why this is the case. However, \ninterview data suggests that despite feeling less confident or apprehensive about teaching \noutside their specialism, this can be handled by working on their SMK (see p 16, Views about \nteaching within specialism). Hence,  trainees could respond positively to \u201cI do not need to teach \nmy specialism\u2026\u201d, while at the same time feeling less confident. This sub-group are tentatively \nlabelled \u201cworking-confident\u201d.  \n \nTwelve trainees agreeing with \u201cless confident outside\u201d could be described as \u201canxious\u201d. These \nsplit 50:50 by gender and degree class, with six possessing 1st or 2:1 degrees. The average age \nis 25, below that of the whole group, although four trainees were aged 30 or over. Reasons for \ntrainees\u201f lack of confidence are unclear, but collectively their backgrounds differ from \u201csuper-\nconfident\u201d and \u201cworking-confident\u201d trainees.  \n \nHandling SMK-related questions  \nStatements investigating trainees\u201f attitudes towards handling SMK-related questions were: \u201cI can \nhandle the situation if I am asked difficult questions outside my specialist area\u201d ( \u201cI can handle\u201d) \nand \u201cI am nervous that I will be asked a question I cannot answer\u201d (\u201cI am nervous\u201d). Anecdotally, \nhandling subject-related questions causes anxiety among many science trainees, particularly in \nthe early stages. A trainee able to cope with these may respond positively (strongly agree \/ \nagree) to the first statement and negatively (strongly disagree\/ disagree) to the second. A more \nnervous trainee may respond oppositely.  \n \nTable 4 shows thirty-two trainees felt nervous about being asked a question they could not \nanswer (strongly agree \/agree), while fifty agreed or strongly agreed with \u201cI can handle\u201d. Overall, \na majority of respondents appear confident about difficult questions, perhaps accepting that \nnerves are to be expected. These underlying response combinations were found:-  \n \n34  (48%)Trainees agreed with \u201cI can handle\u201d and disagreed or were neutral to \u201cI am \nnervous\u201d                                    \n17  (24%)Trainees agreed with both statements        \n15  (22%)Trainees agreed with \u201cI am nervous\u201d and disagreed or were neutral to \u201cI can \nhandle\u201d                                         \n 18 \n \nFive trainees disagreed with \u201cI am nervous\u201d.  \n \nThese figures suggest that about 48% express confidence in their ability to handle questions \noutside their specialist area and feel little or no nerves about being asked questions they cannot \nanswer. About one-quarter (24%) seem to regard nerves as \u201cpart of the game\u201d, responding \npositively to both statements. About 22% seem to have a more \u201canxious\u201d disposition, admitting \nto feeling nervous and not being able to handle difficult questions. Background information \nshows sixteen of the thirty-four trainees (47%) feeling most confident at handling questions are \nmale, skewing this sub-group away from the cohort\u201fs 60:40 split. Twelve of the fifteen trainees \n(75%) feeling least confident were female, a skew in the opposite direction.  \n \nAttitudes to SMK  \nThe statements exploring trainees\u201f attitudes to SMK were \u201cI find it difficult to develop my subject \nknowledge outside my specialist area\u201d (\u201cI find it difficult\u201d) and \u201cI enjoy learning new subject \nknowledge outside my specialist area\u201d (\u201cI enjoy learning\u201d). A trainee with a positive attitude \ntowards outside specialism teaching may respond negatively (strongly disagree \/ disagree) to \nthe first statement and positively (strongly agree \/ agree) to the second. A trainee feeling \nuncomfortable learning new SMK may respond oppositely.  \n \nTable 4 shows highly polarised responses to these statements.  About 79% strongly disagree \/ \ndisagree with the first and 83% strongly agree \/ agree with the second. Although this is a strong \nindication that the majority of respondents have positive attitudes towards acquiring new SMK, \nexamination of underlying response patterns shows that small sub-groups showing slight \nvariations exist:-  \n \n50 (70%) Trainees agreed with \u201cI enjoy learning\u201d and disagreed with \u201cI find it difficult\u201d   \n \n10 (14%)   Trainees were neutral to \u201cI enjoy learning\u201d and were neutral to or disagreed with \u201cI \nfind it difficult\u201d               \n   3             Trainees agreed with both statements        \n   2             Trainees were neutral to \u201cI enjoy learning\u201d and agreed with \u201cI find it difficult\u201c  \n \nSix trainees\u201f responses did not fit into these categories.  \n \nPerhaps most interesting to note is the small number of trainees (3 + 2, last two categories) \nwhose responses suggest they find learning new SMK is difficult: three were females aged over \n30 and three held 2:2 degrees, while the remaining two held 2:1s. This sub-group are noticeable \namongst the overwhelmingly positive responses.  \n \nSemi-structured interview data  \n \nThe twelve interviews indicated the impact perceived by trainees of SMK on their teaching, as \nwell as validating responses found in the questionnaires. The interviewees were slightly more \nskewed towards males (6\/12, 50%) and chemists \/ physicists (5\/12, 42%) than the whole cohort. \nInterviews explored how trainees perceived their SMK and confidence as a teacher impacted on \n 19 \nstudents\u201f learning. Trainees\u201f voices are reported verbatim, although colloquial and dialectical \nexpressions have been modified to ease comprehension. Names used are pseudonyms. All \ninterviewees completed the PGCE course successfully but with differing teaching abilities. In \nreporting their viewpoints, reference is made to interviewees\u201f Likert scale responses, hence \nreferences to \u201csuper-confident\u201d, \u201cworking-confident\u201d and \u201canxious\u201d.  \n \nViews about teaching outside specialism  \nThree main viewpoints corresponding to questionnaire categories (p 12) were apparent.  \nMatthew, an \u201canxious\u201d trainee according to his confidence responses, said this about teaching \noutside specialism :-  \n \n\u201cIn physics when I felt the [children] weren\u201ft grasping it [the topic] I could tackle it \nfrom a different angle by thinking myself, \u201eHow\u201fs the best way to put this across?\u201f \nand going down a different route. That was very limited for me with biology \u2026.I \nwouldn\u201ft have had the knowledge to do that. If it had happened, I would have had \nto extend into a different lesson, and gone away, thought about it and brought it \nback in another lesson.\u201d (Matthew, physicist)  \n \nDaniel and Mary reported differences in the ease with which they prepared for teaching in the \ntwo domains. Their confidence responses corresponded to the \u201cworking confident\u201d category:-  \n \n\u201cI felt I could prepare resources for my specialism much easier, and I was a lot less \nconfident at trying new things, so for chemistry I stuck exactly to what the Scheme of \nWork gave me \u2026 with biology [when I thought] \u201d I don\u201ft agree with that\u201d, it was much \neasier to change things.\u201d (Mary, biologist) \n \n\u201dI was a lot less creative with biology and physics \u2013 that went down to confidence in \nthe material\u2026 I went down traditional lines\u2026 I didn\u201ft tend to [experiment] unlike my \nchemistry where I liked to [be] more creative.\u201d   \n (\u201cDaniel\u201d, chemist)  \n \nThese trainees connect their lack of confidence in their subject matter knowledge for an outside \nspecialism topic to their ability to develop their own ideas for lessons. \u201cSticking to the scheme\u201d \nenabled them to feel safe and secure.  \n \nAnother approach to teaching outside specialism was expressed by George, a \u201cworking-\nconfident\u201d physicist:-  \n \n\u201cI think I just don\u201ft do enough for biology\u2026you\u201fre always looking at your notes \nchecking you\u201fve spelt [words] right, whereas in physics you can go off at a tangent \nbecause you know you haven\u201ft got a problem explaining something\u2026\u201d (George, \nphysicist)  \n \nIn contrast, Simon, a \u201csuper-confident\u201d, expressed confidence in his ability to teach outside \nspecialism:-  \n \n 20 \n\u201c\u2026as long as I\u201fd prepared I felt confident teaching the subject, I was quite \ncomfortable, if you said I was teaching physics top set [most able children], I would \ngo away\u2026 do my research and then I\u201fd be pretty comfortable, you might always get \na question where someone might pull you up, but then you just say to them I\u201fll have \nto go and look at that.\u201d (Simon, chemist)  \n \nThus, trainees perceived differences in confidence for within and outside specialism teaching, \nand articulated reasons for these that corresponded with their questionnaire responses.  \n \nViews about teaching within specialism  \nEight interviewees thought that learning objectives were achieved more easily when teaching \noutside specialism. This is counter-intuitive to expectations, supporting questionnaire data \nreported above (p 10).  Three trainees said that initially they knew \u201ctoo much\u201d and failed to select \ninformation effectively. Mary, for example, found a much lower knowledge level than expected \nwas required:-  \n \n\u201d\u2026at the start, [with my KS4 biology class] I didn\u201ft think [the learning objectives] \nwere all met. They were a \u201cGifted and Talented\u201d [high ability] class\u2026.I was going \nquite quickly \u2026 and I really enjoyed it. I don\u201ft think they were keeping up with me \nas well as I thought they would do\u2026.Towards the end things were better and I \nwould say yes, the learning objectives were being met. In chemistry I would say \nyes, they were met, because I was sticking so closely to the Scheme [of Work]\u201d \n(Mary, biologist)   \n \nMatthew commented:-  \n \n\u201dI feel that teaching outside specialism is better because to a certain extent I \u201em \nlearning as the children are, so I can see [the topic] from their angle, and there is no \nconfusion about what they need to know\u2026 With physics it's different \u2026 there were \ntimes that I knew I was thinking [about] quite high level stuff and then dumbing it \ndown to something they would understand, and that sometimes made my job a bit \nharder \u2026[I didn\u201ft have] enough experience teaching low level things\u201d (Matthew, \nphysicist)  \n \nThe feeling of having to condense specialist subject matter knowledge was expressed by John, \nwhose comment contributes to this paper\u201fs title:-  \n \n\u201c[In chemistry and physics lessons] I could explain things at the level [they] \nshould be explained at. For a biology concept you\u201fve got all this [knowledge] in \nyour mind overriding what you\u201fre telling them. [You know what you say is] \nalmost a white lie, it should be in much more depth, or there are things that you \nknow need to be accompanied with it [that are] not part of the curriculum, its not \npart of what they need to know. There is a conflict in your head\u201d (John, \nbiologist)   \n \n 21 \nNone of the interviewees whose early teaching was more successful outside specialism \nconnected variation in success explicitly to strategies for preparation, although three noted \ndifferences in their strategies. John, for example, relied on his prior learning in school as \npreparation for within specialism teaching, whereas he more actively prepared for physics and \nchemistry lessons:-  \n \nI: How did you prepare the subject knowledge you needed?  \n \nJ: For biology I already had an idea of what I\u201fd already done in school myself\u2026 \nI did think about what I\u201fd learned and I did find it easier to remember the biology \nrelated lessons \u2026 so planning biology lessons, I think I\u201fd already thought about \nit before coming on the course\u2026  \n \nWith regard to chemistry and physics \u2026there was a lot more preparation, \nrelearning things \u2026[for example] I haven\u201ft touched on any physics \u2026 since \nGCSE. \u2026[so] there was a lot more preparation, I used colleagues in school, \nspeaking to other physics teachers, and other people on the course, getting \ntheir advice\u2026   \n \nI: So when you were preparing you were more aware of spending time on \noutside specialism?  \n \nJ: Yes definitely\u2026 I took the [school] textbook \u2026 home and look[ed] at that, but \nI tried to go above that, because children have questions, they want extra bits \nof information\u2026 If you only understand [a topic] to the level they need to learn \nit, you\u201fre never going to be able to teach it, so you need to learn it a couple of \nsteps ahead so you can deal with those unexpected questions and understand \nit further than is expected for them\u201d \n \nIn contrast, Simon, who reported no differences in lesson success, consciously used the same \nstrategies to prepare lessons in both domains, explaining that achieving outcomes depended on \nfinding good activities:- \n \n\u201c\u2026In terms of the learning objectives they were all roughly similar\u2026 in terms of \nactivities I would go out of my way to look in biology to find something a little bit \nbetter [than the school\u201fs Scheme of Work] so I\u201fd go on the internet and find \ninteractive games. In classification, I did find a few, so some of my lessons \nwere better than in chemistry\u2026. it just came down to the activities.\u201d (Simon, \nchemist) \n \nSimon makes explicit that selection of appropriate instructional strategies is one factor that aids \nsuccessful lessons. Trainees relying on prior knowledge alone experienced more difficulty in \nachieving successful lessons within specialism in the early stages of their teaching.  \n \n 22 \nThe need to select appropriate instructional strategies and over-reliance on inappropriate ones is \nillustrated by Jane, a chemist, who copied the style of chemistry teaching she experienced at \nschool:-  \n \n\u201dA lot of the chemistry I learned at school was just copying off the board\u2026 you try \nhard to avoid this, but there\u201fs parts where it comes back that that\u201fs what you do..\u201d \n(Jane, chemist)  \n \nJane\u201fs school experiences exerted a powerful influence on her intuitive approach to teaching \nchemistry; as she had found the subject relatively straight-forward, her instincts led her to want \nto teach as she herself was taught, on the assumption that the learning outcomes would be the \nsame:-  \n \n\u201c\u2026you\u201fve had all that background knowledge and spent all that time learning it \u2026 \nyou can\u201ft then understand why other people don\u201ft get it\u2026\u201d (Jane, chemist)  \n \nJane realized she could not make these assumptions, and subsequently changed her practice. \n \nFinally, Val, a biologist, illustrates that some trainees are closed to the impact of their teaching \non children, until faced with difficult information:-  \n \n\u201d..with respiration I thought I had gone through the topic really thoroughly\u2026 a lot of \nthem didn\u201ft do well in the end of topic test.. Being a biologist didn\u201ft seem to work..\u201d \n(Val, biologist)   \n \nVal is expressing her realization that possession of good SMK on her part is not the only factor \ndetermining learning outcomes.  \n \nA \u201ccontinuum\u201d of experience from Simon, through John and Jane to Val can be seen here. \nSimon grasped early on the need to transform his SMK into activities, using the same strategies \nfor preparation both within and outside specialism.  John and Jane relied on prior experiences to \nhelp them survive, rather than transforming SMK. Both realized the flaws with this approach. \nFinally, Val taught first, then reflected from the students\u201f test results on her performance. \nInterestingly, Simon and Val both fell into the \u201csuper-confident\u201d category (see p 11) \u2013 in Val\u201fs \ncase this proved to be over-confidence. These data suggest the importance of aiding trainees to \ndevelop reflective practices early on.  \n \nHandling subject knowledge-related questions  \nTrainees\u201f initial apprehension at being asked questions they could not answer was apparent. For \nexample, Jane, a highly qualified trainee with a doctorate degree, was one of the fifteen most \nanxious, according to her questionnaire responses (see p 12):-  \n \n\u201cAt the beginning one of your biggest fears is that they are going to ask you things \nthat you don\u201ft know and you are thinking, \u201eWhat am I going to say?\u201f \u2026 but as you \nget into the job you realize \u2026you don\u201ft have to know everything and they won\u201ft \nreally ask you the questions you\u201fre thinking because [the students are] not that \n 23 \nadvanced \u2026\u2013 its like a fear of the unknown. They don\u201ft ask you things that you \nthink they\u201fre going to.\u201d (Jane, chemist)  \n \nOther trainees noted their strategies for handling questions were better in their specialist \nsubjects. Mark who expressed confidence in his ability to handle questions, said:-  \n \n\u201c\u2026the only thing with physics was that I needed to know what they needed to \nknow, but if there was something outside that, then bringing it into the lesson \nwasn\u201ft a problem, and if there was something where I was asked a question and I \nwasn\u201ft sure about it I made a point of telling them I would find it out.\u201d (Mark, \nphysicist)  \n \nJohn, a \u201cworking confident\u201d, learned his material \u201ca couple of steps ahead\u201d of the children so that \nhe could handle questions. He was asked if he was conscious of being able to handle questions \nbetter in biology than physics and chemistry:-  \n \n\u201cIn a way, but I was never scared of children asking questions, if I didn\u201ft know the answer \nI would say so, at first, I thought it would be the end of the world, how stupid would I look \n\u2026 but yes, if a child asked me a biology question I would be much more confident \nanswering it than in physics or chemistry, but if someone asked me a question in physics \nand I didn\u201ft know I would find out and answer it the next lesson.\u201d  \n \nThus, the ability to handle questions seems to rely mainly on trainees\u201f self-confidence. Trainees \ntake a pragmatic approach, finding effective strategies for handling questions to which they don\u201ft \nknow the answer and that children are less demanding than they expected.  \n \nChanges in SMK sources and preparation during the PGCE course  \nTen interviewees stated their preparation time had reduced significantly during the PGCE year. \nAndrew, for example, said that recalling SMK became easier as training progressed:-  \n \n\u201cMy subject knowledge in science has been sleeping. And its all come out again, in \nthis year\u2026[now] subject knowledge takes a back seat to creativity\u201d (Andrew, \nbiologist)  \n \nHis use of the word \u201ccreativity\u201d suggests he has moved from \u201csurvival\u201d and transmission of \nknowledge to \u201ctransformation\u201d of SMK.  \n \nThe notion of \u201cspeeding up\u201d may reflect trainees\u201f increasing confidence in handling classroom \nsituations, reducing the time needed to get their SMK to a level they felt brought confidence.  \n \nHarriet was one trainee who used unchanged approaches throughout the course:-  \n \n\u201cIn the diagnostic [first, short teaching placement], I taught only KS3, and again \nI read the textbook, the knowledge required was so much simpler\u2026. I don\u201ft \nthink my strategies did change, I was reading and talking to teachers, \n 24 \nsometimes I used the internet\u2026. So I don\u201ft think they did change.\u201d (Harriet, \nbiologist)  \n \nAgain, pragmatism plays a role -trainees know what is expected of them and devise coping \nstrategies. They become more skilled at applying these as the course continues. \n \n \nDiscussion  \n \nTrainee science teachers\u2019 SMK sources for within and outside specialism teaching  \nEvidence (Tables 2 and 3) indicates that these science trainees use more SMK sources for \npreparing lessons outside specialism than within specialism. Trainees rely on experienced \ncolleagues and school materials more frequently when preparing outside specialism lessons. \nTrainees also practice unfamiliar experiments before lessons and consult technicians more often \nfor lessons in this domain. The questionnaire and interview data together suggest that intense \nSMK preparation helps transformation to PCK, as trainees believed their efforts enhanced their \nability to deliver outside specialism lessons with appropriate activities that met learning \nobjectives for their students, as well as giving confidence in their teaching skills.  \n \nSMK preparation for within specialism teaching was more casual. Trainees relied on finding out \nstudents\u201f knowledge levels. Three trainees used no SMK preparation strategies at all, relying \nonly on prior knowledge. Fewer experiments were tested in advance of within specialism \nlessons. Perhaps most significant is that trainees consulted experienced teaching colleagues for \nwithin specialism preparation much less frequently. In terms of achieving learning objectives, \neight interviewees indicated their within specialism lessons were in some respects poorer than \noutside specialism lessons. Although none explicitly connected this to poor preparation, a link \nbetween the paucity of SMK sources used and achievement of learning outcomes seems \ndistinctly possible.  \n \nThree interviewees indicated that their difficulties teaching within specialism arose from an \ninability to select appropriate information from their knowledge base, allied to a lack of \nexperience at teaching \u201clow level\u201d material. The description as a \u201cconflict\u201d is powerful \u2013 \nawareness of a wide range of interlinking concepts and partial truths may hinder selection of the \nbest approach to take or strategy to use. This may be a contributing factor to trainees\u201f inability to \ntransform within specialism SMK to PCK. A lack of SMK for outside specialism teaching seems \nto lead automatically to more successful transformation to PCK, most likely because trainees \ninvolve experienced colleagues and are academically able enough to take in new (or revise old) \ninformation rapidly. For teaching within specialism, interviews revealed that trainees work out \nwhat to do for themselves over different time periods.  \n \nOf course, these comments do not apply to all trainees: there is evidence that 20 \u2013 30% of the \ncohort were equally successful at teaching in both domains. Interview data suggest these \ntrainees are those who perceived at the earliest possible stage that successful teaching depends \n(at least to some extent) on good, appropriate activities \u2013 that is, somehow, they hit on the \nimportance of transforming SMK to PCK very early in their practice. Their own personal SMK \n 25 \nappeared secondary to ensuring that appropriate activities were found and prepared in a \nsuitable format for teaching.  \n \nA second finding is the contrast in importance that trainees place on SMK sources from teaching \npractice schools and HEI-based sessions. Despite attending sessions that, at the time, were \nrated (verbally and anecdotally) positively, few trainees used any HEI-based materials or ideas \nregularly, using almost entirely SMK sources from their teaching practice schools. We can only \nspeculate as to possible reasons: for example, HEI sessions may be too generic to be useful to \nspecific school situations, despite efforts to make them relevant; trainees may feel forced to \nabide by schools\u201f strict Schemes of Work; the time lag between an HEI session and teaching a \ntopic may be too long, so the session is forgotten; or sessions were simply too radical and \ncontrasting to what really goes on in school. Science education research is probably perceived \nas too esoteric and difficult to access, as well as being difficult to use directly (one trainee \ncommented to this effect in her questionnaire). Misconceptions may be already embedded in \nschools\u201f Schemes of Work, or are no longer fashionable in the movement in England and Wales \ntowards general scientific literacy. \n \nTrainee science teachers\u2019 confidence for within and outside specialism teaching  \nA mixed picture is observed in data relating to trainee science teachers\u201f confidence. About 20% \nof trainees showed no difference in confidence levels for teaching in either domain. This \u201csuper-\nconfident\u201d sub-group seemed to have prepared themselves mentally for the task of teaching all \naspects of science. This group aside, it is probably fair to say that most trainees inevitably \nshowed some anxiety for outside specialism teaching, at least in the early stages of their \nteaching practice experiences. A sub-group of about twelve demonstrate particularly \u201canxious\u201d \nqualities. They feel nervous about deviating from prescribed Schemes of Work and express \nconcern about answering subject-related questions. However, observations made outside the \nconfines of this study indicated that a majority of these trainees developed good coping \nstrategies and worked hard to overcome both their nerves and any initial apprehension.  \n \nThe trainees in this study are aware that they are well-qualified academically. Over-confidence \nfor within specialism teaching among some is therefore to be expected, at least in the early \nstages. Trainees vary in their ability to recognise this - interview data point to a possible \ncontinuum in the extent to which trainees can reflect meaningfully on their practice.  \n \nTrainees\u201f strong academic backgrounds probably also contributed to their SMK development for \noutside specialism teaching. Around half express preference for teaching their specialism, but \nalso imply they are content to learn new material. The confidence statement responses show \nthat about one-third feel less confident teaching outside specialism, but also don\u201ft mind doing \nthis. Evidence indicates that trainees know how to develop their SMK, and are resourceful and \nresilient in using a range of sources. The average age of 27 suggests that a good proportion of \ntrainees come into teaching from previous jobs, bringing skills that confer maturity in handling \nnovel situations.  \n \nThe \u201csuper-confident\u201d trainees are older than average and particularly well-qualified.  Age and \nwork experience may contribute additional maturity at handling unfamiliar situations, greater \nflexibility in thinking and the ability to take in and act on new knowledge under pressure. Parents \n 26 \nof school-aged children familiar with school environments and used to juggling a variety of \nsituations simultaneously tend to fall into this category.  \n \nConclusions, limitations and practical relevance  \n \nConclusions \nThese data, albeit of a preliminary nature, add to evidence that SMK clearly exerts an influence \non teachers\u201f practices. This study, set in a training environment, supports Davis\u201fs (2003) \nfindings, indicating that good SMK helps trainee teachers select appropriate instructional \nstrategies. However, we may need to adjust our definition of \u201cgood\u201d, as these data suggest that \n75% of interviewed trainees, who possessed \u201cgood\u201d SMK from their degree backgrounds, did \nnot teach successful within specialism lessons, at least in the early stages of their teaching \npractices. Counter-intuitively, transforming SMK and, hence, selection of appropriate \ninstructional strategies, seemed to occur more consistently when teaching outside specialism \ntopics. This position may change as trainees become more experienced. Hashweh\u201fs (1987) \nfindings, for example, contradict these data. Appleton and Kindt\u201fs (1999) work, also with \nexperienced teachers, supports the connection made here: when teaching outside specialism \ntrainees express a lack of confidence in their SMK and work hard to remedy this. However, the \nrole of colleagues is clearly different \u2013 Appleton and Kindt show collegial support is valued \namong teachers post-training, whereas this study shows trainees only ask for this when \npreparing for outside specialism teaching. Youens and McCarthy\u201fs (2007) work suggests that \ntrainees may think seeking colleagues help for outside specialism teaching is regarded as \u201csafe\u201d, \nwhile asking for help for within specialism teaching, that is, for a topic they are supposed to \n\u201cknow\u201d, may signal weakness.   \n \nThe effectiveness of specialised, collegial support on outside specialism teaching supports the \nfindings of Luft et al (2003) and Hoy and Spero (2005). These data also confirm the work of \nYouens and McCarthy (2007) in showing that school-based materials are used much more \nfrequently than HEI-based sources for developing SMK (discussed below). Teacher educators \nand school mentors should strongly encourage trainees to seek (or insist that they take) advice \nfrom experienced colleagues for teaching in both domains, as well as consider the role that HEI-\nbased sessions could play.  \n \nThese data do not provide clear support for de Jong (2000) and van Driel et al (2002) in \nasserting that good SMK helps trainees be more aware of students\u201f difficulties, although, of \ncourse, these studies presented other factors as also being involved. In this case, trainees \nbecame aware of students\u201f difficulties when learning SMK themselves for outside specialism \nlessons. No awareness of difficulties was encountered for within specialism lessons \u2013 rather, \ntrainees tended to over-estimate students\u201f abilities, at least initially.  \n \nThe value placed on HEI-based SMK sessions is questioned. Much time is invested in making \nthese as valuable as possible by including latest research findings, information about up-to-date \nissues in science education and practical experiments, as well as using experienced teacher \ncolleagues and up-to-date published school materials to help make sessions relevant to \npractice. Nevertheless, trainees make little use of these sessions as an SMK source, focusing \ninstead on materials available in school. A second outcome is the need to ensure mentors are \n 27 \naware of the content and potential value of HEI-based sessions, and for teacher educators to be \nyet more explicit as to how to utilise HEI materials, misconceptions and research in lesson \npreparation.  \n \nLimitations  \nNaturally, the study is limited \u2013 firstly by the fact that data are collected from one institution and \nat present constitute a relatively small set. Timing of data collection may mean that trainees\u201f \nviews have changed during the year - data were collected late in the PGCE course. Different \nviews may have been expressed earlier, although interview and questionnaire data together \ncollected over a three month period, suggest that responses are reliable. The questionnaire was \ndesigned for this study and has not been validated through use elsewhere, other than by \ndiscussion. However, responses from the two cohorts showed no significant differences, and \ninterviewees responded in very similar ways over the two years of the study to date. Further, the \ninterviews did support the questionnaire data \u2013 trainees were invited to talk openly about their \nexperiences, without direct reference to the questionnaire, and did so in ways that supported the \nviewpoints they expressed in their questionnaire responses. This suggests that questionnaire \nresponses were internally reliable.  \n \nAn additional limitation is that what we read is trainees\u201f viewpoints \u2013 they were self-reflecting. No \ninformation was gained from other sources, such as mentors or tutors to support these \nobservations, so the statements about \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d of specific lessons are entirely \nbased on the trainees\u201f perceptions. Hence, of course, findings must be regarded as tentative.   \n \nPractical relevance  \nDespite the limitations, the information gathered illuminates the issue of SMK for science teacher \ndevelopment in a training setting in a novel way. Trainees\u201f efforts to remediate weak SMK, \nincluding consulting experienced colleagues for advice, leads to outside specialism lessons \nbeing successful in the early stages of teacher development. Possession of \u201cgood\u201d SMK as prior \nknowledge is insufficient to enable all trainees to prepare and deliver successful lessons within \nspecialism, as they lack experience to transform SMK to PCK effectively. Further, the role of \ngood support in aiding teacher development is confirmed.  \n \nThe issue of how best to prepare trainees for teaching remains open. This study draws attention \nto the possibility of identifying sub-groups of trainees with different characteristics.  Further work \nmay help identify \u201csuper-confident\u201d, \u201cworking confident\u201d and \u201canxious\u201d groups more rigorously, \nwith a view to offering different specialised support. Differentiation of support may help enhance \nthe skills of the \u201csuper-confident\u201d, and encourage more trainees to develop these characteristics.  \n \nThe connection between \u201csuper-confident\u201d and the ability to transform SMK to PCK was \napparent. Trainees with these characteristics challenge the assumption that science specialist \nsubjects are best taught by those possessing specialist degrees. High academic performance in \na specialist subject is not an automatic precursor to good teaching. Trainees with good \nacademic backgrounds tend more often to work from the \u201csurvival\u201d perspective and regard \nteaching as knowledge \u201ctransmission\u201d.  Interviews in this study show the limitations of this \napproach. We anticipate that most trainees make the transition from \u201csurvival\u201d and simple \ntransmission of knowledge to transformation of SMK at some stage during the training \n 28 \nprogramme. The role of colleagues in providing support is identified as a factor aiding success: \nwhere help is asked for, evidence presented here shows this was always regarded positively. \n \nIn terms of the specialist \u2013 generalist debate, this paper indicates that the \u201csubject specialists are \nbest\u201d assumption (Introduction) is not proven. Evidence here is more supportive of the notion \nthat possession of genuine \u201cteacher skills\u201d, that is, the ability to transform SMK to  PCK, is a \nmore significant factor influencing success as a trainee science teacher than simply possession \nof a good degree in a specific subject. The trainee whose comment inspires this paper\u201fs title is \nan academic biologist talking about teaching biology. His conflict was not about how he should \nteach physics. Of course, following trainees\u201f development long term may yield changes \u2013 over \ntime, perceptions of confidence and abilities may change with experience, suggesting that a \nlongitudinal study is worthwhile.  \n \nThis study points towards the unique, raw nature of teachers\u201f starting positions. In the early \nstages, heavy reliance on teaching practice schools is perhaps not unexpected, given the wide \nrange of intense experiences that these naive beginners face. Research with experienced \nteachers post-training shows that skill development continues.  A greater reliance on HEI-based \nsources may occur when the basic range of teaching abilities are in place.  Accordingly, we may \nneed to review the nature and content of HEI-sessions on teacher education courses to ensure \nmaximum impact during training. However, over the early years of a teacher\u201fs career, full \nsupport from HEI- and school-based colleagues is effective in aiding their development. Overall, \nthen, the practical relevance of this study lies in the notion that assessing trainees\u201f personal \ncharacteristics and offering appropriate, realistic, professional support from both HEIs and \nschools in accordance with these may help science teachers develop in the best possible ways.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 29 \nReferences  \n \nAbell, S.K.
