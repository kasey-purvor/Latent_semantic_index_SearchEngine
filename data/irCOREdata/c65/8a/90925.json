Copyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nEspecially when inner conflict is present, people put brakes upon their prejudices. They do not act them out\u2014or they\nact them out only up to a certain point. Something stops the logical progression somewhere (Allport, 1954: pp. 332)\nAllport\u2019s quote shown above suggests that when people experience inner conflict about showing prejudice they may\nstart to exert control over their attitudes. Writing in the USA during the 1950s Allport described a few examples of such\nconflict and people\u2019s attempt to control their ethnic prejudice. In recent times, with the development of a strong anti-racism\nnorm in the majority of the population (Crandall, Eshleman, & O\u2019Brien, 2002; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2000), research shows\nthat most adults are motivated to control their prejudice (Dunton & Fazio, 1997; Plant & Devine, 1998). However, we still\nknow little about the \u2018\u2018something\u2019\u2019 that Allport said helps stop the development of prejudice, especially amongst children\nwho are known to show explicit ethnic bias at an early age (Aboud, 2003; Clark, Hocevar, & Dembo, 1980; Katz & Kofkin,\n1997; Nesdale, 2001, 2004). In this paper we describe two studies that examined affective and social-cognitive factors\nimportant in 6\u20139-year-old children learning to control their ethnic intergroup bias.\nResearch on adults shows that majority status group members generally attempt to control their prejudice. For example,\nsocial psychologists have noted a lack of correspondence between controlled (explicit) and automatic prejudice expression\n(Devine, 1989; Nosek, 2005; Plant & Devine, 1998). Non-prejudiced individuals are typically motivated to inhibit\nautomatically activated cultural stereotypes and establish or maintain a non-prejudiced identity (Devine, 1989). Evidence\nsuggests that these individuals often, following a possible prejudiced response, devote regulatory effort to figure out how to\navoid future prejudiced responses (Monteith, Ashburn-Nardo, Viols, & Czopp, 2002). Majority group adults are also\nknown to expend significant effort to control their expression of prejudice during interracial interaction (e.g., Richeson &\nEuropean Journal of Social Psychology\nEur. J. Soc. Psychol. 40, 679\u2013693 (2010)\nPublished online in Wiley InterScience\n(www.interscience.wiley.com) DOI: 10.1002\/ejsp.746\n*Correspondence to: Sarah FitzRoy, School of Psychology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NP, UK. E-mail: sbsf2@kent.ac.uk\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nReceived 30 June 2009\nAccepted 20 January 2010\nShelton, 2003). Still other research on adults has reported differences between explicit reports in public versus private as\nevidence of the presumed control of prejudice (e.g., Devine, Plant, Amodio, Harmon-Jones, & Vance, 2002; Plant &\nDevine, 1998).\nWhile we have increasing evidence that adults control their prejudice, we know less about children\u2019s self-regulatory\nefforts. An extensive body of developmental research over the last 60 years has found that ethnic bias is present in ethnic\nmajority children as young as 4 years of age (e.g., Aboud, 1988; Katz & Kofkin, 1997). After this, these children\u2019s ethnic\nbias has been found to peak around 5 years of age and then decline past 7 years of age (e.g., Aboud, 2003; Clark et al.,\n1980).\nRecent research in developmental psychology suggests children\u2019s prejudice may decline because they learn to control it\nwhen made publically accountable (e.g., Abrams, Rutland, Cameron, & Ferrell, 2007; Monteiro, Franc\u00b8a, & Rodrigues,\n2009; Rutland, Cameron, Milne, & McGeorge, 2005). For example, Rutland and colleagues showed that increasing\nchildren\u2019s accountability to their peer group, in the sense that their actions are visible and may have to be defended or could\nbe criticized, promotes 5-16-year-old children\u2019s self-presentational control of their ethnic and national intergroup\nattitudes.\nHowever, while we have evidence that children seem to control their prejudice, currently there is a dearth of research\ninto developmental factors important in children\u2019s learning to control their prejudice. Research in the adult literature has\nsuggested that social emotions (e.g., guilt, embarrassment, and shame) encourage people to self-regulate their attitudes\n(Devine, Monteith, Zuwerink, & Elliot, 1991; Monteith, 1993; Monteith, Devine, & Zuwerink, 1993; Monteith et al.,\n2002; Zuwerink, Devine, Monteith, & Cook, 1996). For example, Monteith (1993) argued and found that adults learn to\ncontrol their prejudiced responses through self-regulation after they realize they have or might respond with greater\nprejudice than expected. This process results in the experience of negative self-directed affect (e.g., guilt, embarrassment),\nwhich acts to control prejudice expression.\nSocial emotions, such as embarrassment, shame, pride, and guilt (Modigliani, 1968, 1971) are known to develop during\nmiddle childhood (Tangney & Dearing, 2002). In particular, developmental research shows that the attribution of social\nemotions increases substantially between the ages of 5 and 11 years (Bennett, 1989; Bennett, Thompson, Yuill, &\nBanerjee, 1998; Bennett & Gillingham, 1991). For example, Bennett, Thompson, Yuill, and Banerjee (1998) showed that\n5\u20137 year olds self-attributed significantly fewer social emotions than 9 year olds in a hypothetical incident involving them\nengaging in a rule violation in front of a passive audience (i.e., no overt reaction to the child\u2019s behavior is cited) while being\nresponsible for another child who is a friend.\nA more recent study by Banerjee (2002b; Experiment 2) also found that children\u2019s attribution of embarrassment\nincreased noticeably between 7 and 8\u20139 years of age and the attribution of embarrassment was associated with the\nidentification of self-presentational motives suggesting that development of this social emotion is related to the degree to\nwhich social evaluation issues are salient to a child. This finding is compatible with other research that suggests people\nwho are prone to frequent and excessive embarrassment tend to be more self-conscious than the average person and are\nmore concerned about receiving negative evaluation from others (Buss, 1986; Edelman, 1987; Leary & Meadows, 1991;\nMiller, 1995).\nWe will test two age groups of 6\u20137 and 8\u20139 years since the above developmental research suggests that between these\nages children begin to develop the self-attribution social emotions such as embarrassment. Research also shows that\naround this age children\u2019s explicit ethnic bias begins to decline while their implicit ethnic bias remains constant (Baron &\nBanaji, 2006; Rutland et al., 2005) and children become aware of peer or adult norms regarding the expression of\nintergroup bias (Abrams & Rutland, 2008; Augoustinos & Rosewarne, 2001). We expect to find that 6\u20137 year olds on\naverage will show little evidence of social emotions and therefore, be less inclined to control their intergroup attitudes;\nwhereas, 8\u20139 year olds will overall have a higher propensity to show social emotions and thus control their expression of\nintergroup bias.\nWe will measure the self-attribution of social emotions using a task similar to previous developmental research\ndescribed above (e.g., Bennett, 1989; Bennett & Gillingham, 1991), but like Bennett et al. (1998; Experiment 2) the\nhypothetical scenario involving a rule violation will include the participant being responsible for a younger friend. This\ncontext of having the child taking care of a younger friend when committing a faux pas was included because it\naccentuated the potential for social emotions in the situation. The only difference compared to previous research is that our\nversion will only include the self-story scenario whereby the child commits an embarrassing act and not when the child\u2019s\nfriend commits the act. The reasoning for inclusion of the self-story only is that children\u2019s feelings of blame for the friend\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Soc. Psychol. 40, 679\u2013693 (2010)\nDOI: 10.1002\/ejsp\n680 Sarah FitzRoy and Adam Rutland\ncommitting the act were only shown in 9\u201311-year-old children (Bennett et al., 1998). The important matter here is that\nusing this task allows us to determinewhether the participant also attributes social emotions to this young friend (i.e., other\nattribution).\nWe contend that the self-attribution of social emotions suggests children have social evaluation concerns. Moreover, if\nchildren also experience social emotions on behalf of a friend they should be able for example, to appreciate the feelings\nother people close to them (e.g., in-group classmates and teachers) might have if they contravene an in-group norm about\nthe inappropriateness of expressing ethnic intergroup bias. Hence, older children (i.e., above 8 years) with a higher on\naverage propensity to show self and other-attribution of social emotions should demonstrate more control of their explicit\nethnic attitudes than younger children (i.e., below 8 years).\nThis study will examine the control of children\u2019s intergroup attitudes by manipulating public accountability by using a\nsimilar technique to that utilized by Abrams et al. (2007), whereby children were told their answer\u2019s would be shown to\nother children from their in-group. In this study to increase the strength of public accountability children will be informed\nthat both in-group classmates and teachers will see their answers to an explicit ethnic attitude measure. However,\nimportantly, there will still be some public accountability in the control condition since an experimenter will be present\nduring testing.\nWe expect children 8 years and above with a lower individual propensity to attribution self and other social emotions\nwill not easily appreciate the feelings of the in-group. They will need to rely on social cues (i.e., high public accountability)\nto facilitate self and other attribution of social emotions and the control of ethnic intergroup bias. Therefore, these older\nchildren\u2019s intergroup attitudes will be affected by the public accountability manipulation and they will decrease their bias\nin the experimental compared to the control condition. In contrast, older children with an high individual propensity to\nshow social emotions should show an immediate interruption in their ongoing behavior and prospective reflection which\nwill prevent biased responses in both the control (i.e., lower public accountability) and experimental (i.e., higher public\naccountability) conditions.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\n287White British children (153males and 134 females) aged 6\u20139 years of agewere selected from ethnically homogeneous\nprimary schools in a suburb of London. The schools\u2019 ethnic composition reflected the ethnic diversity of this London\nsuburb (Census 2001, Office for National Statistics); with 91.5%White British children, 2.91% Black African\/Caribbean-\nBritish children and 5.59% from other ethnic minorities (e.g., Asian-British, Chinese-British, mixed ethnicity). All the\nteachers in the schools were White British. There were two age groups of children; one hundred and thirty 6\u20137 year olds\n(M\u00bc 6 years and 5months, SD\u00bc 5months) and a hundred and fifty seven 8\u20139 year olds (M\u00bc 8 years and 5months, SD\u00bc 5\nmonths).\nProcedure\nChildren were tested individually in their schools. First they completed a modified version of the social emotion task\n(Bennett et al., 1998). Following this they completed an explicit ethnic intergroup attitude task (Aboud, 2003; Doyle &\nAboud, 1995) whilst they were either under low or high public accountability. Boys and girls in each age group were\nrandomly assigned to either the low or high public accountability condition. Public accountability was manipulated using a\nsimilar technique to that employed by Abrams et al. (2007). In the high public self-focus condition (n\u00bc 144, 50.2%)\nchildren were told that their ethnic in-group classmates and teachers would see their answers to the explicit intergroup\nattitude task. In the low public self-focus condition (n\u00bc 143, 49.8%) children were told that their answers on this task\nwould not be shown to their ethnic in-group classmates and teachers. Immediately after the children had completed all the\nmeasures they were debriefed and given a parental debrief form to ensure them that although they had been told their\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

(1998) and in these stories\nthe child themselves was cast as the central character. In each vignette, they were described as committing a faux pas in\na public setting. There were two story contexts (supermarket and bus stop). For instance the bus-stop context story;\n\u2018\u2018Imagine you\u2019re out shopping in the supermarket with your mum and with a little 2-year-old friend called Jo. Your mum\nneeds to fetch some bread, so she says to you, \u2018\u2018Please look after little Jo for a minute. Make sure that Jo behaves. Do you\nthink you could do that?\u2019\u2019 So Mum goes off to get the bread, and you wait with Jo next to the tins of baked beans. You\u2019re\nholding Jo\u2019s hand, when suddenly, you knock over thewhole pile of baked beans tins [CRASH!]. The bean tins roll all over\nthe floor, and all the people in the shop are looking at you. They all saw what happened.\u2019\u2019\nEach child heard both contexts and the order of presentation was counter-balanced. Each story was accompanied by\ntwo colored pictures, the first showing their mother asking the child to look after the toddler and the second showing the\nnegative event with onlookers.\nChildren were asked the following questions (the same in both story contexts): (a) \u2018\u2018Now remember, you were supposed\nto be looking after little Jo. How would you feel about what happened? Why? (Anything else?); (b) \u2018\u2018How would little Jo\nfeel about what happened? Why?\u2019\u2019\nScoring of Social Emotions\nChildren\u2019s answers to questions (a) and (b) were coded as either showing social emotions or not (i.e., 1\u00bc social emotions\nattributed or 0\u00bc no social emotions attributed). The social emotions included in the children\u2019s answers were\nembarrassment, guilt, or shame. Nearly all social emotion responses included the word embarrassed, though on some\noccasions, clear paraphrases were accepted: \u2018\u2018I\u2019d feel silly because everyone is staring at me.\u2019\u2019 Some other children said\nthey would feel silly or stupid, but as they did not refer to the scrutiny of others, these were coded as zero.\nThe answers to questions (a) and (b) were then added together separately for both contexts (supermarket and bus stop)\nto produce a score ranging from 0 to 2. These scores were positively correlated for bus and supermarket contexts (r\u00bc . 21,\np< .01) and thus were added together and averaged to produce one final \u2018social emotions\u2019 score. For ease of analysis, a\nthreshold split of> 0 was used on the social emotion scores so that children who did not attribute social emotions had\nscores below this threshold (N\u00bc 142, 49.5%) and children who did social emotions had scores above this threshold\n(N\u00bc 145, 50.5%).\nOne tenth of all responses, randomly selected from each age group, were double-coded by an independent judge. Inter-\nrater agreement exceeded 81% in all cases demonstrating satisfactory inter-rater reliability.\nExplicit Ethnic Attitudes\nThe Multiple-Response Racial Attitude measure (MRA; Aboud, 2003; Doyle & Aboud, 1995) was used to derive the\nchildren\u2019s ethnic intergroup bias. The children were presented with 20 traits (10 positive and 10 negative) taken from\nthe Preschool Racial Attitude Measure II (Pram II) Series A (Williams, Best, Boswell, Mattson, & Graves, 1975). These\nwere the same traits as used successfully by Rutland et al. (2005) who also tested children aged 6 years and above and\nrequired the participants to evaluate children. The positive traits were: clean, wonderful, healthy, good, nice, happy,\nfriendly, helpful, kind, and smart. The negative traits were: unfriendly, mean, dirty, cruel, stupid, selfish, sick, naughty, sad,\nand bad.\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Soc. Psychol. 40, 679\u2013693 (2010)\nDOI: 10.1002\/ejsp\n682 Sarah FitzRoy and Adam Rutland\nChildren were presented with one copy of each trait on card and asked to place them in four cups showing either a photo\nof a Black child, a White child, both a Black and aWhite child or a blank cup. The children were explicitly told they could\nput the card in the \u2018Black\u2019 cup, the \u2018White\u2019 cup, the \u2018Both\u2019 cup (i.e., both \u2018Black\u2019 and \u2018White\u2019) or in the \u2018Blank\u2019 cup. They\nwere also told the later response meant that they did not think the word described either child. To ensure children\nunderstood the meaning of each word, they were given a corresponding definition. To ensure understanding of the task,\ninitially each child was asked to practice assigning traits by attributing four non-evaluative items to each of the categories\n(Black-Gutman & Hickson, 1996). These items were \u2018likes to run\u2019, \u2018likes to sing\u2019, \u2018likes TV\u2019, and \u2018likes music\u2019.\nThe number of traits assigned to the Black child andWhite child was computed. Four scores were calculated; a positive\nand a negative trait score for each ethnic group, each with a possible range of 0\u201310. The higher the scores on positive traits\nand the higher the scores on negative traits the more positive and negative the child\u2019s ratings, respectively. Then a positive\nbias score was derived by subtracting the out-group positive trait score from the in-group positive trait score; and a\nnegative bias score was derived by subtracting the in-group negative trait score from the out-group negative trait score.\nFinally the positive bias score was added to the negative bias score and divided by 2 to give an intergroup bias score, the\nhigher this score meant the more ethnic intergroup bias shown.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe correlations between all variables are shown in Table 1. A x2 test of independence was performed to examine the\nrelation between children\u2019s social emotions and age group. There was a significant association between age and social\nemotions x2(4, N\u00bc 287)\u00bc 15.85, p< .01. As can be seen from Table 2, children increased their self-attribution of social\nemotions with age so that a significantly higher percentage of 8\u20139-year-old showed social emotions (58.6%, n\u00bc 92) than\ndid 6\u20137 year olds (40.8%, n\u00bc 53).\nChildren\u2019s explicit ethnic intergroup attitude scores were submitted to a 2 (Age)\u0001 2 (Public accountability)\u0001 2 (Social\nemotion level; high and low) between participants ANOVAs. As expected we found a significant three way interaction\nbetween Social emotions, Public accountability and Age, F(1, 279)\u00bc 3.83, p< .05, h2\u00bc .02. The sample was then split by\nage group and there was a significant interaction between Public accountability and Social emotions for 8\u20139 year olds F(1,\n279)\u00bc 4.08, p< .05, h2\u00bc .03 but not for 6\u20137 year olds F (1, 279)\u00bc .67, p> .05.

This is shown in Figure 1b. It is clear\nfrom this figure that 8\u20139-year-old children who did not show social emotions reduced their intergroup bias between the low\npublic accountability condition (M\u00bc 0.09, SD\u00bc 1.45) and the high public focus condition (M\u00bc\u00030.89, SD\u00bc 2.44). In\ncontrast, it is also evident from Figure 1b that intergroup bias amongst the 8\u20139-year-old children with a high propensity to\nshow social emotion level was not affected by the public accountability manipulation, t (90)\u00bc\u0003.97, p> .76.\nThese findings suggest that social emotions moderate older majority status children\u2019s developing ability to control their\nexpression of explicit ethnic intergroup bias. The intergroup attitudes of the younger children, who overall showed little\ntendency to attribute social emotions to the self and others, were as expected unaffected by our public accountability\nmanipulation. Also as predicted our findings suggest that 8\u20139-year-old children with a higher individual propensity to\nattribute social emotions, where unaffected by the public accountability manipulation. In contrast, 8\u20139 year olds with a low\nindividual propensity to show social emotions controlled their ethnic intergroup bias when public accountability was\nincreased. Arguably these children did not establish under low accountability that they and their in-group would feel social\nemotions (e.g., embarrassment) when answering an explicit ethnic bias measure and only did so when made highly\naccountable to their ingroup.\nThese findings appear convergent with the adult literature on prejudice control which shows that the main difference\nbetween low and high prejudiced individuals is the ability to control prejudice (Devine, 1989). It is also convergent with\nresearch (Monteith, 1993; Monteith et al., 2002) which indicates that social emotions (e.g., guilt, embarrassment) serve as\nwarning signals to facilitate the control of prejudice. Study 1 suggests that the attribution of social emotions is an important\nFigure 1.

Further, recent research suggests that\nchildren\u2019s understanding of these social norms requires cognitive effort, in particular the ability to understand other\npeople\u2019s mental states, attitudes or beliefs about social relationships (Abrams, Rutland, Ferrell, & Pelletier, 2009; Abrams\n& Rutland, 2008; Banerjee, 2000). Together this research suggests that social norms and second order mental state\nunderstanding may also moderate children\u2019s control of their ethnic intergroup bias. To test this proposition we conducted a\nsecond study.\nStudy 2\nIn Study 2 we vary public accountability as we did in Study 1, and we anticipate that children\u2019s control of their ethnic\nintergroup bias when held publically accountable will be moderated by their understanding and awareness of the in-group\nnorm about showing intergroup bias. This is because once children understand the in-group social norm they can\nstrategically present the self as acting in accordancewith this norm, so giving a positive impression of themselves to the in-\ngroup.\nDevelopmental psychologists have recently begun to demonstrate that group norms affect young children\u2019s explicit\nethnic intergroup attitudes (Apfelbaum, Pauker, Ambady, Sommers, &Norton, 2008; Nesdale, Durkin,Maass, & Griffiths,\n2005; Rutland, 2004; Rutland et al., 2005; Rutland et al., 2007). For example, Nesdale et al. (2005) found that 7-year-old\nchildren only showed explicit ethnic prejudice when either a pro-prejudice norm and\/or an out-group threat was made\nsalient. Nesdale and colleagues also found older 9-year-old children showed evidence of ethnic prejudice control, except\nwhen both an in-group pro-prejudice norm and out-group threat was present. Similarly, Rutland et al. (Study 1, 2005)\nfound that 5\u201316-year-oldWhite British children highly aware of the social norm against expressing explicit racism showed\nlow explicit ethnic prejudice. In contrast, children with little awareness of this norm only inhibited their prejudicewhen the\nnorm was made salient by increasing their accountability.\nWe expect children who have a strong awareness that their in-group typically shows low ethnic intergroup bias (i.e.,\nhold an anti-prejudice norm) are mostly likely to inhibit their explicit ethnic intergroup bias under high public\naccountability. It is possible that children may think their in-group typically shows high intergroup bias (i.e., hold a pro-\nprejudice norm) and in this case wewould not expect children to show any evidence of bias control. Arguably the presence\nof a pro-prejudice norm is less likely in the domain of ethnic intergroup attitudes because research suggests in western\nsocieties amongst most ethnic majority people there is a clear and strong social norm about showing explicit positivity\ntowards the Black ethnic minority out-group (see Crandall et al., 2002; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1998; Zitek &Helb, 2007). In\ncontrast, research suggests that children often perceive pro-prejudice norms in the domain of national intergroup bias (e.g.,\nRutland, 1999; Bennett et al., 2004; Abrams et al., 2009).\nHowever, the control of explicit intergroup bias by attending to an in-group anti-prejudice norm is also likely to involve\nrecursive reasoning about mental states, since the child is concerned about the way he or she is seen in the mind of others.\nThis ability initially involves what developmental psychologists call \u2018Theory of Mind\u2019 (ToM), namely the capacity to\nimpute mental states or understand what others think and believe (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). Developmental\npsychologists have typically measured ToM using what are known as \u2018false belief\u2019 tasks which reveal whether children\nunderstand that it is possible to hold beliefs that are different from reality (Wimmer & Perner, 1983). Essentially in this\ntask a child is privy to some crucial information that another child does not have and they are judged to hold ToM if they\nrealize the other child will behave consistent with their lack of information rather with the information held by the child.\nDevelopmental research (e.g., Sullivan, Zaitchik, & Tager-Flusberg, 1994) shows children from 5 years of age engage\nin recursive mental state reasoning about false beliefs (i.e., understand that one person may have a false belief about\nanother person\u2019s belief). This second-order false belief understanding is known to develop well into middle childhood\n(Baron-Cohen, O\u2019Riordan, Stone, Jones, & Plaisted, 1999). From around 6\u20137 years of age children can understand false\nbeliefs about social, not just physical, stimuli (e.g., Nguyen & Frye, 1999; Symons,McLaughlin, Moore, &Morine, 1997),\nand begin to understand about false emotions as well as false beliefs (Harris, Johnson, Hutton, Andrews, & Cooke, 1989).\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Soc. Psychol. 40, 679\u2013693 (2010)\nDOI: 10.1002\/ejsp\nLearning to control intergroup bias 685\nIn the present study we measured children\u2019s second-order mental state understanding using a measure of Theory of\nSocial Mind (ToSM) first developed by Abrams et al. (2009). This task was selected because we were concerned with\nchildren\u2019s inferences about the expression of liking or disliking. The ToSM task tests children\u2019s ability to distinguish their\nown feelings about a character from the feelings of a peer who does not share the same information about that character.\nThis requires an ability to use information about the prior social relationship between two peers to make an inference about\ntheir feelings towards one another, independently of the child\u2019s own knowledge and feelings about that peer. The ToSM\ntask is based in the interpersonal domain, allowing us to be confident that it does not simply measure children\u2019s learning of\na particular social norm for a specific group.\nFurther, Abrams et al. (2009) found that children\u2019s understanding of group dynamics and norms (i.e., who will be\naccepted and rejected by the group) was associated with the development of ToSM. Children with high ToSMwere able to\nuse this understanding to inform their exclusion judgments of individual group members. This finding suggests that ToSM\nmay be important to children\u2019s ability to understand group norms about showing explicit bias and their control of explicit\nintergroup bias (Rutland, 2004; Rutland et al., 2005; Apfelbaum et al., 2008).\nResearch suggests that children begin to show second-order mental state understanding involving false emotions\n(Harris et al., 1989) and liking in social relationships (Abrams et al., 2009) from approximately 6\u20137 years of age. This is\nwhy 6\u20139-year-old children, who should already show some ToSM ability, were examined within the Study 2. However,\nunlike in Study 1, the age was used as a continuous variable since the developmental literature has not identified any major\nshift in children\u2019s ToSM ability beyond 6\u20137 years of age.\nIn Study 2, we expect children will only control their ethnic intergroup bias when they are aware that their in-group\nholds an anti-prejudice norm. Furthermore we anticipate that children\u2019s ToSM will moderate whether they act in\naccordance with this in-group norm when held publically accountable to the in-group. Children high in ToSM should\nreadily perceive the anti-prejudice norm even under minimal public accountability (i.e., when only the in-group\nexperimenter is present) and, therefore, show low intergroup bias in both the low and high public accountability\nconditions. In contrast, we expect children with low ToSMwill significantly decrease their intergroup bias between the low\nand high public accountability conditions, since the manipulation will cue them to attend to and act upon the anti-prejudice\nin-group norm.\nMETHOD\nParticipants and Design\n236White British children (123 males, 113 females) aged between 6\u20139 years (M\u00bc 7 years and 9months, SD\u00bc 12months)\nwere selected from ethnically heterogeneous elementary schools in a predominantly White middle-class suburb outside a\nlarge metropolitan city in the southeast region of England. According to the Commission for Racial Equality (2006), only\n8.5% of the schools population in this area was from an ethnic minority and all teachers in the schools were White British.\nProcedure\nChildren were tested individually in their schools after parental\/guardian consent was obtained. They first completed in a\ncounter balanced order the ToSM measure (Abrams et al., 2009) and a measure of the children awareness of the in-group\nnorm about showing intergroup bias. Following this, as in Study 1, the children completed an explicit ethnic intergroup\nbias measure (Aboud, 2003; Doyle & Aboud, 1995) under either low or high public accountability. Assignment to the low\nor high public accountability condition was random in each age group. Public accountability was manipulated using a\nsame technique to that in Study 1. This created a high public accountability condition (n\u00bc 120, 50.8%) and a low public\naccountability condition (n\u00bc 116, 49.2%).\nMeasures\nExplicit ethnic attitudes. TheMRA (Aboud, 2003; Doyle &Aboud, 1995) was used as a measure of intergroup attitudes, as\nin Study 1 and was scored in the same way as described in Study 1.\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The task\nhas a social focus, requiring understanding of how a first character will feel towards a second character who has secretly\nstolen the first character\u2019s toys. To answer correctly children must dissociate their own evaluation of the thief from the\nevaluation held by the first character. They have to understand the mental state of the first character and accurately assess\nthis character\u2019s evaluation of thief. This social situation provides a parallel context to the social cognitive demands\nchildren may face when making social judgments about group behavior, such as how other in-group members would feel\ntowards an out-group.\nChildren were told, \u2018\u2018Jack and Chris have just met for the first time. Jack is playing a gamewith Chris. Jack is having fun\nand is enjoying playing the game a lot. Then Jack leaves the room to get a drink. While Jack is gone, Chris steals some of\nJack\u2019s toys. Jack comes back after Chris has hidden the toys in his pocket.\u2019\u2019 This story was told with illustrative pictures to\naid understanding and to keep the children\u2019s attention. Children were then asked, \u2018\u2018Do you think Jack likes Chris?\u2019\u2019, and\n\u2018\u2018Why\/why not?\u2019\u2019 Children should state that Jack likes Chris because Jack did not know about the theft.\nResponses were scored according to both the judgment of whether Jack would like Chris or not, and also whether the\nexplanation indicated that the child understood that Jack was unaware Chris had stolen the toys. A score of zero was\nassigned to incorrect answers (\u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019) including any with the explanation that Jack would not like Chris because Chris\nstole\/is a thief. A score of 1 was assigned to correct answers, (\u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019) but with a limited explanation (e.g., \u2018\u2018because he\nplays with Chris\u2019\u2019). A score of 2 was assigned to correct \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 answers that included an accurate explanation (e.g.,\n\u2018\u2018because he thinks Chris is nice\u2019\u2019, or \u2018\u2018because he doesn\u2019t know Chris took the toys\u2019\u2019). A higher score indicated more\nadvanced ToSM.\nAwareness of In-group Norm\nIn contrast to previous studies (e.g., Rutland et al., 2005) which have assessed children\u2019s personal norms about showing\nintergroup bias, in this study we examined their awareness of social norms about showing prejudice held by their in-group.\nChildren were presented with a pictorial ambiguous money scenario from the Ambiguous Situations Task (McGothlin,\nKillen, & Edmonds, 2005; McGothlin & Killen, 2006). In this money situation picture, two children (one White and one\nBlack) are standing outside on a playground. The White child has her\/his pockets pulled out with a distressed expression\non his face. A \u00a35 note is on the ground behind him. The Black child is bending down picking up the \u00a35 note. Children were\nfirst presented with this picture (N.B. boys received a picture with boys as characters and girls were given a picture with\ngirls as characters) then asked to imagine that another white child or white teacher in their class had seen the picture. Then\nthey were presented with 12 different statements that could be said about this picture (six positive and six negative). The\nsix positive statements were: \u2018The Black child is picking up the money to give it back to theWhite child\u2019; \u2018The Black child\nhas seen the money but won\u2019t steal it\u2019; \u2018The Black child can\u2019t have stolen the money as he\/she is not nasty\u2019; \u2018The Black\nchild is being helpful\u2019; \u2018The Black child is kind sowill give the money back to theWhite child\u2019; \u2018The Black child is not bad\nso will give the money back\u2019. The six negative statements were: \u2018The Black child has seen the money and will steal it\u2019;\n\u2018The Black child stole the money because he\/she is nasty\u2019; \u2018The Black child is a thief\u2019; \u2018The Black child is picking up the\nmoney as he\/she will steal it\u2019; \u2018The Black child is not being helpful as he\/she will take the money and keep it\u2019; \u2018The Black\nchild is bad so will not give the money back\u2019.\nChildren were then asked to rate how many children and teachers in their class would say the each of the above\nstatements if they saw the picture. A series of response scales was presented, showing proportionate numbers of stick\npeople with labels representing almost all the children\/teachers, most of the children\/teachers, about half of the children\/\nteachers, a few of the children\/teachers, and none of the children\/teachers. This was later scored as a scale from 0 (none) to\n4 (almost all). Children\u2019s answers for the six positive statement were reversed scored and combined with responses for the\nsix negative statements, so a higher score (above 2) indicated the children thought their in-group would show ethnic bias\ntowards the out-group (i.e., pro-prejudice norm) and lower score (below 2 meant the children perceived their in-group\nwouldn\u2019t show bias towards the ethnic out-group (i.e., anti-prejudice norm). Analyses revealed the 12 items had good\nreliability (a\u00bc .85), so all items were retained for analysis and averaged to give a total prejudice norm score.\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Analysis of children\u2019s intergroup bias was conducted using\nmultiple regression with Age (in months), ToSM score, Prejudice norm score as continuous predictors and Public\naccountability (dummy coded as high or low) as a binary predictor. To test our hypotheses, procedures recommended by\nAiken andWest (1991) were followed. We first centered age, ToSM score, Prejudice norm score and Public accountability\nand computed their two, three, and four way interactions which were then entered hierarchically as predictors of\nintergroup bias.\nOverall the regression model significantly predicted the children\u2019s intergroup bias, R2\u00bc .11, F(14, 235)\u00bc 1.76, p< .05.\nAge was a significant predictor of intergroup bias (b\u00bc\u0003.24, t\u00bc\u00033.58, p< .01), indicating that as age increased\nintergroup bias decreased. As expected, there was also a significant three-way Prejudice norm\u0001 Public\naccountability\u0001ToSM interaction (b\u00bc\u0003.14, t\u00bc\u00031.97, p< .05). A simple slopes analysis revealed that public\naccountability had a significant effect on intergroup bias for low ToSM (t\u00bc\u00032.72, p< .01) children but not high ToSM\n(t\u00bc 0.36, p> .05) children, only when they thought their in-group held an anti-prejudice norm (see Figure 2a, b). In these\nFigures the effects for ToSM are represented by values \u00fe\/\u00031 standard deviation from the mean.\nIn line with our prediction, only children with low ToSM scores who thought their in-group wouldn\u2019t discriminate\nagainst the out-group significantly decreased their intergroup bias when public accountability increased. In contrast,\nchildren with high ToSM scores who were aware their in-group held an anti-prejudice norm (children with low scores on\nthe norm task) showed low intergroup bias irrespective of the public accountability manipulation. The intergroup attitudes\nof children who thought their in-group held a pro-prejudice norm (children with low scores on the norm task) were as\npredicted unaffected by our public accountability manipulation.\nStudy 2 makes an original contribution by revealing that ToSM and children\u2019s awareness of the in-group norm together\nmoderate children\u2019s control of their ethnic intergroup bias when held publically accountable to the in-group. These\nfindings go beyond previous research showing that children control their prejudice (Abrams & Rutland, 2008; Nesdale,\n2004; Rutland, 2004; Rutland et al., 2005) by highlighting how social-cognitive and normative processes combine during\nthe process of prejudice control in childhood.\nGENERAL DISCUSSION\nTogether the two studies described in this paper tell us about the \u2018something\u2019 Allport (1954) said is required for children to\ncontrol their intergroup bias. They suggest that both the development of social emotions (e.g., embarrassment) and ToSM\nin combination with children\u2019s awareness of in-group norm moderate how children inhibit their intergroup bias when held\naccountable to the in-group. Our studies support the notion that children\u2019s intergroup bias may decline due to children\u2019s\nincreasing ability to control their bias when made publically accountable to the in-group (e.g., Abrams et al., 2007;\nMonteiro et al., 2009; Rutland, 1999, 2004; Rutland et al., 2005). Moreover they make a novel contribution by showing for\nthe first time amongst children affective and social-cognitive factors that influence how they learn to control their explicit\nethnic intergroup bias.\nTable 3.

Indeed previous developmental research has suggested that\nthe attribution of social emotions such as embarrassment is associated with recursive cognitions about other\u2019s mental states\nand second-order mental state understanding (e.g., Banerjee 2002b; Bennett & Matthews, 2000). Our studies suggest a\nchild\u2019s developing capacity to understand their social emotions and beliefs, and they how might be different or the same as\nother\u2019s social emotions and beliefs is important if they are to control their intergroup attitudes. This type of recursive\nreasoning about emotions and mental states in intergroup contexts arguably offer the child the potential to frame their\nintergroup attitudes to create a positive image amongst their in-group (i.e., engage in self-presentation).\nHowever, our findings suggest that such recursive social reasoning may not always result in low explicit intergroup bias\nsince self-regulation of bias also appears to be depend on the specific social norms children perceive to be held by the in-\ngroup to which they are accountable. In Study 2 children who perceived a pro-prejudice in-group norm showed no\nFigure 2.

Psychol. 40, 679\u2013693 (2010)\nDOI: 10.1002\/ejsp\nLearning to control intergroup bias 689\nevidence of decreased ethnic bias under in-group accountability. Pro-prejudice in-group norms regarding national\nintergroup bias have been found before in studies with white European children in either the UK (e.g., Abrams, Rutland,\nCameron, & Marques, 2003; Abrams et al., 2009; Rutland, 1999) or the Netherlands (e.g., Verkuyten, 2001). Indeed, in\nline with our argument, Rutland et al. (2005\u2014Study 2) found that 10\u201312-year-old white British children increased their\nnational intergroup bias when an in-group pro-bias norm was made salient by increasing their in-group accountability. A\nrecent study by Abrams et al. (2007) also showed that above 7 years children\u2019s social exclusion of individuals who\nchallenged the validity of the in-group within a relatively minimal group context increased when they were made\naccountable to the in-group. These studies show that self-regulation can also operate to facilitate intergroup bias in the\ndomain of nationality and minimal groups where arguably different social norms about showing explicit intergroup exist.\nAn alternative account of our findings with children scoring high on the social emotions and ToSM tasks may simply be\nthat these children are more empathic towards the out-group since previous research has shown that enhancing children\u2019s\nempathy is associated with lower explicit intergroup bias (Aboud & Levy, 2000; Feshbach & Feshbach, 1998). Future\nresearch could address this point directly by measuring children\u2019s empathy (see Nesdale, Griffiths, Durkin, & Maass,\n2005). The use of an implicit measure of ethnic intergroup bias alongside an explicit measure within our experimental\nparadigm might also clarify whether children with high social emotions and ToSM are controlling their explicit bias.\nNonetheless the findings of Rutland et al. (2005; Study 1) suggest that older children (i.e., 10 years and above), who should\nshow high social emotions and ToSM, are indeed controlling their explicit attitudes under in-group accountability because\nthey continue to show implicit ethnic bias despite showing less explicit ethnic bias.\nHowever, empathy cannot explain why children with little propensity to show social emotions or ToSM significantly\ndecreased their intergroup bias when made highly accountable to the in-group. A manipulation making children\naccountable to the out-group may have increased these children\u2019s empathy for the out-group and so decreased intergroup\nbias, but it seems unlikely this occurred with our in-group accountability manipulation. Instead our findings relating to the\nchildren with little social emotions or ToSM suggests their decreased intergroup bias results from being held highly\naccountable to the in-group which most likely holds a moral norm that one should be empathic and less biased towards the\nethnic out-group. These children, unlike the high social emotions and ToSM children, required increased public in-group\naccountability before they appreciated how the in-group felt towards the out-group and only then showed lower intergroup bias.\nA potential limitation of our research was the use of the extended identity task to measure social emotions in Study 1\nsince it included a question that asked children to judge the feelings of a toddler they had in their care. Developmental\nresearch has shown that children as young as 2-year-old are not capable of feeling social emotion like embarrassment or\nguilt (e.g., Bennett, 1989). It is possible though debatable whether our 5\u201311-year-old participants were aware of these\nemotional limitations of toddlers. Nonetheless if the children inferred the toddler was feeling social emotion they could\narguably be engaging in egocentric attribution. The inclusion of an older friend in the faux pas story might have addressed\nthis issue, but then it would have been difficult to make the child feel a sense of responsibility for the child. Indeed we\ndeliberately created a context of having the child taking care of a younger friend when committing a faux pas because it\naccentuated the potential for social emotions in the situation. Future research should aim to measure children\u2019s attributions\nof social emotions when they commit a faux pas in a context involving an older friend while maintaining a sense of\nresponsibility for this friend.\nAnother factor to consider in future research is children\u2019s motivation to comply with social norms that condemn explicit\nethnic intergroup bias even though they may have the capacity to show high attribution of social emotions and ToSM. For\ninstance, how much children identify with their group may also affect their motivation to control explicit intergroup bias.\nChildren with high group identification may show greater attention to the norm held by their group (Abrams & Rutland,\n2008; Abrams et al., 2003) and subsequently be more likely to self-regulate their attitudes and if their group norm is to\nreject discrimination then they should control their intergroup bias.\nIn the majority of societies now explicit ethnic intergroup bias is rare (Dovidio & Gaertner, 2000) and most adults, and\nwe would suggest children too, are able and motivated to control their intergroup bias (Plant & Devine, 1998). Recent\nresearch, however, suggests that ethnic majority children still show implicit ethnic bias (e.g., Baron & Banaji, 2006;\nDunham, Baron, & Banaji, 2006; Rutland et al., 2005), so future research should also examine how we might reduce\nchildren\u2019s implicit ethnic bias. Previous research has shown that amongst ethnic majority status children extended contact\nwith other ethnic groups (i.e., vicarious friendships) is associated with lower implicit ethic bias (Turner, Voci, &\nHeswstone, 2007). Future research should examine causality within this relationship (i.e., do children who have less\nimplicit bias seek out contact or does contact cause less bias in the first place?).\nCopyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Eur. J. Soc. Psychol. 40, 679\u2013693 (2010)\nDOI: 10.1002\/ejsp\n690 Sarah FitzRoy and Adam Rutland\nTo conclude, our studies suggest that the ability to attribute social emotions together with the interactive effect of\nchildren\u2019s knowledge of in-group norms and \u2018\u2018ToSM\u2019\u2019 moderate how children control their ethnic intergroup bias when\nheld accountable to the in-group. Overall both studies extend previous research which has shown children self-regulate\ntheir intergroup attitudes when held publically accountable and demonstrate that factors know to facilitate intergroup bias\ncontrol in adults begin to emerge in early childhood. If we are to encourage people, as Allport suggests, to \u2018put the brakes\non\u2019 prejudice our findings suggest we need early interventions aimed at promoting children\u2019s attribution of social emotions\n(e.g., embarrassment), social-cognitive ability to understand other\u2019s mental states and wider anti-prejudice in-group norms\nwithin society.\nREFERENCES\nAllport, G.
