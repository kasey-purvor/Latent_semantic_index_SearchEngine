An extension of this is required \nby the ADME scientist; not only to understand how the body works but, more \nimportantly, to be able to predict how it will respond to chemical exposure. In the last \ndecade a step-change has occurred in the capacity of man to generate information \nabout the biological subsystems of the body, and how these alter in response to \nchemical exposure. This increase in technological ability has resulted in a huge \namount of data available in silico to the research scientist; the challenge now is how \nto make the most use of this information. \nThis review will aim to examine the emergent technologies available for large \nscale information gathering, as well as the databases where such information is stored. \nWhereas public data storage is a central part of open-access research for the scientist, \nperhaps of more import today is the development of tools with which to analyse this \nfreely available data, and a selection of these tools will also be covered in this review. \nPublic domain storage of sequence information and the development of \ncomputational tools to examine such a large amount of data are central to our further \nunderstanding of systems biology. However, six years after the sequencing of the \nhuman genome how far have we actually come? What insights (if any) have we learnt \nthrough the mining of these large databases? This review will attempt to address this \nquestion, or at least some parts of it,  by examining how in silico analysis has aided \nour understanding of human biology, and in particular ADME: First, how the \nsequencing of non-human genomes may increase our knowledge of how the human \nbody functions. Second, the discovery of novel genes, which may represent novel \ntherapeutic targets, or whose protein products may impact upon ADME processes. \n 4\nFinally, how single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis may help researchers to \nunderstand\/predict inter-individual variation in response to chemical exposure. \n \nLooking in to the past: What can phylogenetic analysis tell us? \nThere are presently fully sequenced genomes from just over 800 different species \n(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/), the majority of which are available through public domain \nrepositories such as NCBI, EBI and GenomeNet (based in the USA, Europe and Japan \nrespectively).  If one also includes all currently active genome sequencing projects \nthen this number increases to over 4500 (Table 1), with approximately one third of \nthese being animal species. However, a cursory glance at these will tell you that of \nthese 800 only a relatively small number represent species directly applicable to the \nAMDET process (Table 2). \n \n[TABLE 1+2 AROUND HERE] \n \nThe impact of the human genome sequence has been obvious and immediate; with \nit we are (theoretically) able to identify every human gene and extrapolate this \ninformation to functional biology. Indeed, some startling discoveries have been made \nsuch as the relatively low number of genes (now estimated at 20-25,000; Consortium \n2004), and the overall high level of identity to supposedly very different organisms \nsuch as the mouse (Lander, et al. 2001, Waterston, et al. 2002). What has not been \nachieved (yet) however is a full understanding of the human biological system and all \nits intricate workings, and for that the other 800+ sequenced genomes have a \nsignificant role to play. From a homocentric point of view one can imagine that \nhumans are at the (current) end of an evolutionary process that began some 3.5 billion \n 5\nyears ago (Kumar and Hedges 1998). This evolutionary process, culminating in Homo \nsapiens has revolved around the emergence of traits that allow humans to survive in \nour particular environment. Thus, we cannot say that we are the pinnacle of evolution, \nmerely the end of this particular branch; other organisms have evolved to suit their \nparticular environments and are hence the \u2018top\u2019 of their evolutionary tree. Traits that \nare beneficial for survival are kept, whereas those that are non-essential to life may be \nlost or altered through time. Following this argument in reverse it can be argued that \ntraits (or genes) maintained in a large number of organisms are important for life in \ngeneral, whereas those that exist in only a single species are important for that \norganism to exist in its particular environment. Through the study of the genomes of \nour evolutionary ancestors it may thus be possible to gain insights into the functioning \nof the human body. In addition, the less complex biological systems exhibited by \nmany of these organisms means that gene functions are much better described, and \nhence it is possible to gain insights into human systems biology through the study of \nthese \u2018simpler\u2019 organisms. \nGenes whose protein products are involved in ADME lend themselves well to this \ntype of analysis for a number of reasons. First, the need to respond to external \nchemicals has existed for a long time, thus meaning that these genes are present \nthrough millions of years of phylogenetic lineage. Second, the requirement to respond \nto a large number of different chemical entities has resulted in relatively large gene \nfamilies: Such large numbers per species are useful in phylogenetic analysis for \nexamining differences between evolutionarily close species (e.g. rats and humans). \nThird, the different environments that organisms are exposed to results in different \npressures upon them, favouring the emergence of traits to cope with these specific \npressures. By studying how different organisms have evolved to cope with their \n 6\nparticular environments we may gain important insights into how humans have \nevolved to cope with ours. \nPerhaps the two best examples of where phylogenetic analysis has yielded insights \ninto biological function for ADME-related genes are the cytochrome P450s and their \ncontrolling ligand-activated transcription factors, the nuclear receptors. \nCytochrome P450 phylogenetic analysis \nCytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are amongst the most ancient proteins known, with \ngene present in all species examined from archaebacteria to humans (Nelson, et al. \n1996). The reason for the prevalence is simple; CYPs are a fundamental enzyme \nfamily in the metabolism (both anabolic and catabolic) of the endogenous chemicals \nrequired for life (Nebert and Gonzalez 1987). Their ability to metabolise xenobiotics \nis to a great extent an acquired secondary characteristic, albeit one central to ADME. \nIndeed, the majority of human CYPs are still concerned with endogenous metabolism, \nwith only CYP families 1-3 (representing 18 out of 57 human CYPs) primarily \nconcerned with the metabolism of xenobiotics (Werck-Reichhart and Feyereisen \n2000). The number of CYP genes underwent a rapid increase following the \ndevelopment of organisms with a gastro-intestinal tract, with increased chemical \nintake through the diet becoming a significant driver in the need to evolve new \nproteins capable of metabolising these chemicals (Nebert and Gonzalez 1987). An \ninteresting example of this is how rodents have evolved over 100 individual CYP \ngenes, far greater than the 57 found in humans. A cogent argument is that omnivorous \nrodents take in many more chemicals through their diet due to their scavenging \nlifestyle, and hence require more CYPs to protect them from potential toxins. \nThe Committee for Standardised Cytochrome P450 nomenclature has accepted the \nunenviable task of bringing all CYP sequence-related research under one roof, and \n 7\nmore importantly under one naming system. Sequences are named according to their \nidentity, being assigned to families and sub-families at the 70 % and 40 % identity \nlevels respectively. Such a nomenclature relies upon the accuracy of gene \nidentification, and by inference the accuracy of gene prediction software (Wang, et al. \n2004). Unfortunately, Cytochrome P450 gene sequences do not lend themselves well \nto automated identification; CYP genes sequences are often highly similar, and often \nexist as chromosome clusters of related genes. Such clusters are easily misinterpreted \nby automated gene prediction programs, producing \u2018fusion-genes\u2019 from two CYP-\ngene sequences within the gene cluster (Nelson 2002, Nelson 2005). For example, in \nhuman the four CYP3A sub-family members CYP3A4, 5, 7 and 43 are located on \nchromosome 7q21 within a single cluster, demonstrating an average 82 % identity \n(Gibson, et al. 2002). CYP gene prediction is particularly difficult in plant genomes, \nwhere gene clusters can extend to 10 or more highly related gene sequences (Nelson, \net al. 2004). To further complicate the situation some CYP genes have evolved \nremarkably short exons, often comprised of only three or four amino acids \n(Doddapaneni, et al. 2005). Such short exons are often excluded by automated gene \nprediction programs, obviously impacting upon any naming system relying upon \nsequence identity, as well as potentially altering the implied biologically functioning \nof the protein products. Thus, it can be seen that whereas there have been huge \nimprovements in the gene-hunting software available, for many gene families such as \nthe CYPs there is no alternative but painstaking individual annotation by scientists. \nMore than anything else this justifies the existence of websites such as the Committee \nfor Standardised Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature, preventing duplication of this \npainstaking work, or invalid investigations based upon the erroneous gene sequences \nproduced via automated data mining. \n 8\nThe many genome sequencing projects underway now make it possible to \nexamine CYP evolution among a wide range of organisms, including humans and \nrodents (96 million years divergence), humans and pufferfish (420 million years \ndivergence; Nelson 2003) and humans and Arabidopsis (670 million years \ndivergence; Nelson, et al. 2004). Through the study of CYPs in a monocot (Oryza \nsativa, Japanese rice) and dicot (Arabidopsis) plant it is apparent that plants have \nmany more CYPs than humans, with these species having ~350 and ~250 CYP genes \nrespectively. The reason for this large number of CYP genes is not clear, but Nelson \nand colleagues speculate that it may be as a result of the pressures exerted on early \nplants during colonization of land (Nelson, et al. 2004). Of the rice and Arabidopsis \nCYPs approximately two-thirds are shared, having emerged prior to the monocot-\ndicot divergence 200 million years ago; however, despite this large overlap in shared \ngenes only approximately one fifth of the CYP subfamilies are conserved, with these \npresumably encoding those CYPs involved in reaction fundamental to survival.   \nComparing CYPs from humans and the pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) produces \nfar fewer differences than observed between plants and humans (Nelson 2003). \nDespite over 420 million years of divergence pufferfish and humans share 17 out of \nthe 18 CYP families, and within these families gene structures (e.g. intron-exon \nboundaries) are well conserved. Such results suggest that the defining characteristics \nof vertebrate CYPs have been in place for at least 420 million years, with the only \nmajor divergences seen in those subfamilies, such as CYP2C, which are primarily \ntargeted towards the metabolism of xenobiotics (Nelson 2003). The unique family in \nhumans compared to pufferfish is CYP39, and this in itself is interesting as the \nemergence of this sub-family provides an alternate pathway for the biosynthesis of \nbile acids: This is a demonstration of the ability of CYPs to produce safety-nets, \n 9\nwhereby important metabolic functions exhibit redundancy in an attempt to prevent \ntoxicity due to disruption of cellular homeostasis.  \nNuclear receptor phylogenetic analysis \nIf the CYP-family members are the engines of Phase I metabolism then the nuclear \nreceptors can be envisaged as the drivers; they control the when, where and how \nmuch for expression of many of the CYP genes as well as a large number of other \ngene families involved in ADME. It is thus logical to apply the same phylogenetic \nanalysis to this family of ligand-activated transcription factors as it was to their target \ngenes; understanding the evolution and biological functioning of nuclear receptors \nmay help researchers further understand the regulation\/functioning of their target \ngenes. \nFollowing the complete sequencing of the first three mammalian genomes \n(human, rat and mouse) Zhang and colleagues undertook an examination of the \nnuclear receptor family in these three species, employing a different approach to \nidentifying novel related genes (Zhang, et al. 2004). Using the Pfam database \n(http:\/\/www.sanger.ac.uk\/Software\/Pfam\/; Bateman, et al. 2004) these latter authors \nidentified six structural and functional protein domains specific for the members of \nthe nuclear receptor family, and then identified these in the 62 previously annotated \nhuman, rat or mouse nuclear receptors. Next, the complete genomes of the three \nspecies were examined for these Pfam domains using GENEWISEDB (Birney and \nDurbin 2000). Finally, alignment to the known nuclear receptor family members was \nthen used to complete gene characterization. Using this methodology an additional 82 \ncomplete nuclear receptor genes were identified, along with two decayed aberrant \ngenes sequences and ten pseudogenes. Of the 144 complete genes, 47 were present in \nrats, 49 in mice and 48 in humans; in itself an interesting finding when one considers \n 10\nthe disparity in murine and human CYP number, archetypal nuclear receptor target \ngenes. The \u2018missing genes\u2019 in rats are NR1D2 and NR2E3, but their absence may be \nexplained by gaps in the rat genome sequence at the places where they would be \npredicted to occur based upon their location in the mouse genome.  \nExamination of the rate of nucleotide substitutions within the nuclear receptor \nfamily, resulting in either synonymous (Ks) or non-synonymous (Ka) amino acid \nsubstitutions within the translated protein, revealed little species-specific differences, \nsuggesting that for most of the nuclear receptors ligands were unlikely to be species-\nspecific. However, for PXR and CAR Ka\/Ks values were 4.0 and 5.6 times greater \nthan average respectively, suggesting positive selection for ligands; this is perhaps \nunsurprising considering the role of these two nuclear receptors in regulating the \nbody\u2019s ability to respond to external chemicals, exposure to which is often species-\nspecific due to the different diet compositions of these species. Such information must \nalso raise concerns for ADME-testing and species extrapolation; this data confirms \nthe observation first made in CYPs, that the very proteins whose responses we wish to \nstudy\/predict are those that evolve the most rapidly and are therefore the most \nproblematic to predict for. Increased Ka\/Ks rates were also observed for members of \nthe NR0B and NR1H sub-families, although the biological causes\/consequences of \nthis have not yet been elucidated. \nThe examination of the nuclear receptor family has resulted in a number of \nimportant discoveries. First, rapid evolution of members of this family, in particular \nPXR and CAR, demonstrates a strong positive selection, probably driven by the need \nto respond to external stimuli. Indeed, the Chicken Xenobiotic Receptor (CXR) has \ndiverged into the Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR, NR1I3) and Pregnane X \nReceptor (PXR, NR1I2) in the space of only 310 million years (Handschin, et al. \n 11\n2000). As a result of this divergence, higher vertebrates, including primates, have \ngained a second receptor targeted toward the capture, interpretation and response to \nexternal stimuli, potentially an important factor in the success of these species in \nsurviving on an omnivorous diet. Second, this evolution has resulted in the same sort \nof redundancy seen in the CYP enzymes, where one chemical may be a ligand for \nseveral receptors (e.g. CAR and PXR) providing a \u2018metabolic safety net\u2019 (Xie, et al. \n2000), or where internal control mechanisms (e.g. auto-regulation of PXR expression \nby PXR protein) are present to regulate the biological action of these interactions, thus \npreventing\/reducing negative impacts on cellular homeostasis (Aouabdi, et al. 2006). \nPerhaps the most surprising conclusion from the phylogenetic analysis was the \nancestry of the SHP and DAX1 genes. SHP and DAX1 are the two members of the \nNR0 family of nuclear receptors and are unique in the fact that they do not contain a \nDNA-binding domain (Bavner, et al. 2005). The lack of functional DNA-binding \ncapacity within these two proteins was suggestive of ancient nuclear receptors, from \nwhich the DNA-binding, fully functional family members had evolved (Guo, et al. \n1996). However, this more complete phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrates that \nthese two latter nuclear receptors evolved from the NR2 branch of the phylogenetic \ntree, rather than acting as the root for the entire tree. During, or closely after the \nemergence of these NR0 family members the DNA-binding domain coding sequence \nappear to have been lost, with rapid sequence evolution following. The biological \nconsequence of nuclear receptors without DNA-binding capacity is now emerging, \nwith both SHP and DAX1 being implicated in the regulation of other nuclear \nreceptors via protein:protein interactions (Bavner, et al. 2005, Niakan and McCabe \n2005). The formation of non-DNA binding heterodimers of SHP\/DAX1 with other \n 12\nnuclear receptors effectively acts as a sink, removing nuclear receptors from the pool \navailable to interact with ligand and\/or DNA, regulating their biological effect. \n \nNew gene discovery \nExpressed Sequence Tag Analysis \nThe advent of high throughput sequence analysis has had two major benefits. As \ndiscussed in the previous section, the first of these is the production of complete \ngenome sequences for a large number of organisms, allowing phylogenetic analysis of \ngene families, providing further insights into their biological roles. The second major \nbenefit is a large increase in the number of expressed sequences available in \ndatabases. These sequences are often multiple repeat sequencing reads of known \ngenes\/transcripts, which can be used to identify sequence variation, as will be \ndiscussed in the next section. However, a large number of these sequences are \nunassigned to any particular gene\/transcript and hence may represent \u2018novel\u2019 \nsequences; herein I will discuss how these potentially novel sequences can be further \nexamined.  \nEntire sections of sequence repositories are now devoted to expressed sequence \ntags (ESTs); those sequences are derived from mRNA and which should therefore \nresult in a protein product, but for which no protein product or biological function has \nbeen assigned. It is from this latter pool that the exciting possibility of novel gene \nidentification emerges. Before classifying any EST as a product of a \u2018novel gene\u2019 it is \nimportant to note that the majority of ESTs merely represent unassigned transcripts \nand not novel transcripts. Due to technical considerations in transcript \nisolation\/processing and the use of high throughput single-read sequencing, much of \nthe transcript sequence deposited in databases is not full length and biased towards the \n 13\n3\u2019 terminus. Given that the majority of eukaryotic genes produce transcripts with \nuntranslated regions (UTRs) at either extremity, and that the average length of a 3\u2019 \nUTR is 826 bp for humans (Wren, et al. 2000) and \nhttp:\/\/innovation.swmed.edu\/research\/informatics\/res_inf_pom.html), it is perhaps not \nsurprising that the majority of ESTs contain mainly 3\u2019 UTR sequences. As UTRs are \nin general not as well conserved as the coding sequence within a transcript (Wren, et \nal. 2000) identification of any transcript from this sequence may be problematic as \nidentification via orthologues may be inaccurate, particularly for transcripts from \nlarge gene families, such as those associated with ADME. Hence, ESTs often merely \nrepresent 3\u2019 sequences of transcripts that have not been married to their known genes, \nand this can be achieved with relative ease using simple database searching. However, \na number of ESTs do not map to known genes, nor translate to proteins of known \nfunction; these represent transcripts from completely novel genes, and are of \nparticular interest both in understanding the potential biological effects of chemicals, \nbut also for the identification of potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of \ndisease. \nTarget Gene Identification \nAn important step in understanding\/predicting how the body responds to chemical \nexposure is the characterisation of what molecular events occur immediately \nfollowing exposure. Such events may be classed as direct (e.g. binding of a nuclear \nreceptor to its target gene) or indirect (e.g. expression of other genes as a result of the \ndirect actions of the chemical), and it is important to separate these two if we are to \nfully understand the molecular responses to chemical stimulation. To understand the \nchronology of response, and hence the mode of action of chemicals it is important to \n 14\nidentify the primary gene targets, with these later being associated with (secondary) \nbiological responses.  \nAn example of such an approach is provided by Horie-Inoue and colleagues, who \nmined the human genome sequence to identify potential binding sites for nuclear \nreceptors involved in hormone homeostasis\/response (Horie-Inoue, et al. 2006). The \nandrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor and \nmineralocorticoid receptor all bind to an IR3 response element comprised of two \ninverted AGAACA half-sites, separated by three nucleotides. Genome wide scanning \nfor this sequence identified 565 exact matches for this element, and of these 26 were \nwithin 10 Kb of the known transcription start sites for annotated human genes. \nChromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was then used to identify which  nuclear \nreceptors (if any) bound to these sites, revealing 14\/26 to be active. This data shows \nthe potential and limitations of in silico screening; whereas such data mining \nidentified 565 potential binding sites, only 5% were close to known genes and of \nthese only one-half were shown to be bound by a nuclear receptor. Thus, while such \ntechniques can be seen to generate a lot of potential clues, they do not provide the \nanswers \u2013 for that wet-lab experiments are a necessity.  \nIt should also be noted that this type of analysis concentrates on perfect matches to \nthe consensus binding site, and will almost certainly miss some functional binding \nsites as nuclear receptors have been clearly demonstrated to bind to sequences \ndivergent from their consensus binding site (Song, et al. 2004, Xie, et al. 2000). This \nis highlighted by the recent work of Steketee and colleagues who, rather than search  \nfor one perfect \u2018consensus\u2019 element within a large amount of DNA, searched for \nmany near-perfect elements within a restricted region of DNA (Steketee, et al. 2004). \nUsing this approach these latter authors identified a non-perfect HRE within the first \n 15\nintron of the specifically androgen-regulated gene (SARG), and went on to show that \nthis site was functional via ChIP.  \nHence, it can be seen that a combination of the two previous methods is \nrecommended to provide the most complete coverage for identifying putative \ntranscription factor binding sites \u2013 an arduous task given the complexity of the human \ngenome. A potential solution for this problem is the use of phylogenetic \nfingerprinting. Through the use of programs such as rVISTA (Loots and Ovcharenko \n2004, Loots, et al. 2002) and PipMaker (Schwartz, et al. 2000) it is possible to scan \ngenome sequences for areas of conservation across species (Pennacchio and Rubin \n2003). Those regions that show highest conservation usually correspond to genes, \nwith the next most highly conserved regions often representing regulatory elements. \nUsing such an approach Ozyildirim and colleagues recently examined lacrimal gland \ntranscriptomes to identify \u2018lacrimal-specific\u2019 transcripts, plus the regulatory elements \nputatively involved in their expression (Ozyildirim, et al. 2005). They were able to \nidentify a number of \u2018lacrimal-specific\u2019 transcripts but showed that conservation of \nthe expression and regulation of these specific transcripts between mouse and human \nwas poor; questioning the relevance of currently used murine models of human dry \neye syndromes. \nBiological function identification \nAnother benefit from the large sequence repositories is that there is now a large \namount of data available for transcript expression levels in different tissues and under \ndifferent conditions. With such information it should be possible to identify \ndifferences between, for example, normal and diseased tissue (Mandel, et al. 2003, \nMariadason, et al. 2002) or before and after exposure to a chemical (Natsoulis, et al. \n2005, Rogler, et al. 2004). This would allow the identification of the expression \n 16\nchanges elicited by a stimulus, and through modelling of the pathways affected by \nthese changes insights into the molecular mechanisms of response can be gained. \nMassively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) is a technique for generating \nlarge numbers of very short sequences very rapidly (Brenner, et al. 2000). These can \nthen be identified through mining of sequence databases to identify longer sequences \nfor which genes\/protein products have been assigned, and the number of tags present \nfor each signal provides a measure of the expression level. The throughput of MPSS \nmeans that all transcripts within a given cell (>200,000) can be sampled very rapidly, \nmeaning that the complete cataloguing of gene expression within cell types\/conditions \nis now possible (Jongeneel, et al. 2005). Chen and colleagues used such an approach \nto first identify 1,056 transcripts predominantly expressed in human testis, and then \ncompared the expression of these genes in normal tissue and testis cell lines. Using \nthis approach they were able to identify 20 cancer\/testis antigen genes, whose \nexpression is linked to the hypomethylation that occurs during cell transformation \n(Feinberg, et al. 2002), including a previously unidentified gene family. Such genes \noffer exciting potential therapeutic targets for the development of antibody-based anti-\ncancer agents.  \n \nSNPs and Splicing: Producing alternate transcripts \nAs previously discussed, the rapid increase in the size of sequence databases is due to \ntwo main driving forces, the sequencing of novel genes\/transcripts\/genomes from \ndisparate species and the repeated sequencing of these targets. The repeat sequencing \nof already \u2018known\u2019 sequences is important for two functions: First, it confirms the \naccuracy of a sequencing project, analogous to the requirement to carry out a wet-lab \nexperiment at least twice to confirm the validity\/robustness of conclusions, and \n 17\nsecond, it reveals any variation seen within that sequence that is not due to \nexperimental\/technical error but a true variation seen within the general population. \nThis variation may be due to alternative splicing of identical pre-mRNA transcripts, \nor due to variations within the genome itself; both of these scenarios will be discussed \nin the following sections, along with their potential implications for ADME. \nSplice variants of ADME-related genes \nFollowing the discovery that the human genome contains only approximately 20,000 \ngenes came the realisation that added complexity must be factored in to achieve the \ntotal number of observed proteins in humans, estimated at an order of magnitude \nhigher. A large amount of this variation can be accounted for by the presence of post-\ntranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, which occur to most proteins. \nHowever,  it is becoming increasingly clear that at least some of this increase in \ncomplexity is achieved through the use of alternative splicing, where different  exons \nare spliced  together from the nascent pre-mRNA to form the mature mRNA, \ntranslation of which produces a protein product with the inclusion\/removal of \ndifferent amino acid cassettes (Lareau, et al. 2004). Indeed, it has been estimated that \nmore than half of all human genes are capable of producing alternative splice variants \n(Hanke, et al. 1999). Such splice variants may have a number of roles; for example \nthe tumour necrosis factor receptor gene (TNFR) gives rise to at least ten different \nsplice variants, which may affect factors such as sub-cellular localisation of the \nreceptor (Xing, et al. 2003) or cellular predisposition to apoptosis (Screaton, et al. \n1997). A number of specialist websites have now been developed to provide central \nrepositories for alternate splice variants of genes, some of which are given in Table 3. \n \n[TABLE 3 AROUND HERE] \n 18\n \nAlternative splicing of ADME-related genes is a common phenomenon, with \nexamples existing at the level of drug transporters, nuclear receptors and enzymes. \nThis review will concentrate on splice variants within ADME-related enzymes as \nexamples of both the prediction and biological consequences of alternative splicing. \nN-acetyltransferases are widely expressed enzymes important in the conjugation of \namino and hydroxyl amino groups with acetate, and are responsible for the \nmetabolism of a number of xenobiotics, including the activation of arylamine and \nheterocyclic amine procarcinogens (Gooderham, et al. 2001). In humans, two N-\nacetlytransferase enzymes are present, NAT1 and NAT2, and recent work by Butcher \net al described the genomic organization of the former of these genes, and identifies a \nnumber of splice variants (Butcher, et al. 2005). The NAT1 gene is comprised of nine \nexons, but, unusually, the protein coding region of NAT1 is contained within just a \nsingle exon, with the remaining eight coding for the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR). \nExamination of the NCBI EST database identified these non-coding exons and \nsuggested that at least three alternative promoters were involved in the production of \nnine separate splice variants from this gene. As the splice variants alter the non-\ncoding region of the transcript they do not produce proteins with different activities \nbut rather have different translation efficiencies. Butcher et al suggested that the \ndifferential expression of these splice variants throughout the body may go some way \nto explaining the different activity of NAT1 in different organs of the body. \nAn interesting form of alternative splicing seen in a number of ADME-related \ngenes is the use of alternative promoters. Here, transcription may begin at a number of \nalternate first exons within a gene, presumably driven via alternative \nbiological\/xenobiotic stimuli. The resultant pre-mRNA will contain the requisite \n 19\nnumber of conserved exons plus at least one alternate first exon(s): The mature \nmRNA is then generated through the splicing out of any extra first exons. Examples \nof ADME-related genes for which alternative promoters\/first exons play an important \nrole in their biological functioning are the UDP-glucoronosyltransferase (UGT1A) \ngene (Tukey and Strassburg 2000) and the N-acetyltransferase 1 gene (Butcher, et al. \n2005). These two examples demonstrate the different biological affects that \nalternative splicing may cause: In the UGT1A gene, splice variants result in proteins \nwith significantly different catalytic activities, whereas NAT1 splice variants result in \ndifferent levels of protein expression. The UGT1A gene is of particular interest since \nthe protein products generated from four common exons and one, variable, first exon \nare sufficiently different to be termed separate proteins, forming the members of the \nUGT1A-family (Tukey and Strassburg 2000). This is thus an example of how \nalternative splicing can considerably alter the functionality of a protein product, to the \npoint where it can be considered a separate entity rather than just a variant. \nAlternate splicing shows the remarkable flexibility of genomic DNA, in that the \nderivation of protein products from static nucleotide sequences can be manipulated to \nincrease the complexity of the biological system. Not only is this a very elegant \nmethod for increasing the ability of a system to change in response to external \nsituations, be they developmental stage of chemical exposure, but it also allows the \nmaximal variation in protein products to be formed with the minimum changes in \ngenomic DNA: Thus, alternative splicing represents a very elegant method for \nbiological systems to respond to the World in which it lives. \n \nDNA variation in ADME-related genes \n 20\nAlternative splicing may be seen as a consistent form of variation (if such a thing \nexists!) in that it allows all members of a species to produce alternate transcripts, and \ntherefore protein products from a single gene, under different biological conditions. In \ncontrast, genetic polymorphisms are defined as variation in genome sequences within \na population, with not all members of that species having the same sequence. These \nfeatures may be combined, with a polymorphism creating splice variants through the \naddition\/removal of splice donor\/acceptor sites. For example, expression of CYP3A5 \nin humans is varied, with only approximately 25% of American Caucasians \nexpressing a functional protein (Gibson, et al. 2002). This variation is, at least in part, \ncontrolled by a polymorphism that allows the introduction of mini-exons into the \nmature mRNA; as these mini-exons contain stop codons the resultant splice variant \nproduces a truncated protein that is non-functional (Kuehl, et al. 2001).  \nPolymorphisms are a likely source for the well known variation in predisposition \nto disease, and as such much study has been undertaken on examining associations \nbetween genotype status and predisposition to disease. However, due to a large \nnumber of factors (population size\/source screened, environmental considerations etc) \nmany of these studies have failed to show convincing, or reproducible, associations. \nPerhaps the most convincing association to date between a DME and disease \npredisposition is  CYP19 and hyperandrogenism. In comparison to the relatively \nsparse evidence for associations between DME status and disease predisposition, \nmuch evidence exists for the role of DME status and variation in response to \ntherapeutic agents (Table 4 for examples), and this is hence an important research \ntarget, particularly given the increasingly global market for drugs. The ability to \npredict the efficacy, or potential adverse effects, caused by drugs when given to \nindividuals from different genetic backgrounds would be of great benefit, perhaps \n 21\neven heading towards the holy grail of personalised medicine (Vizirianakis 2004). \nHowever, before such a goal can be reached not only must the sources of genetic \nvariation be identified, but their effect on ADME established. \n \n[TABLE 4 AROUND HERE] \n \nAs can be seen from Table 4 even a cursory search of PubMed will reveal a host \nof SNPs associated with altered response to therapeutic agents, resulting in \nloss\/reduced efficacy or an increased risk of adverse effects. However, such \ninformation is not particularly accessible, with the search term largely determining the \ninformation retrieved. To allow more efficient identification of SNPs and their \nbiological function a number of specialized websites have been developed such as \nHGVBase (http:\/\/hgvbase.cgb.ki.se\/; (Fredman, et al. 2002), dbSNP \n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/projects\/SNP\/; (Sherry, et al. 1999), SNP Consortium \n(http:\/\/snp.cshl.org\/; (Thorisson and Stein 2003) and HapMap \n(http:\/\/www.hapmap.org; (Consortium 2003), which are fully searchable curated \ndatabases of SNPs. Perhaps the most ambitious of these is HapMap, which aims to \nproduce a freely available resource of the frequency and associations between in \nexcess of one million variants from population deriving from Africa, Asia and \nEurope; the first phase of this project was recently completed, with 269 DNA samples \nfrom diverse ethnic backgrounds analyzed for these SNPs (Consortium 2005). In \naddition to these more specialized databases, general databases such as Gene and \nOMIM (both at http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/), Ensembl (http:\/\/www.ensembl.org; \n(Birney, et al. 2004) ) and GeneCards (http:\/\/bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il\/cards\/) \ncontain much useful information on a large number of genes, including \n 22\ncommon\/biologically important polymorphisms, with links to relevant literature; as \nsuch they should be the first stop for any researcher wishing to assess the potential \nimpact of polymorphisms on their pet gene. In relation to ADME-related genes it is \nalso worth noting that for CYPs the CYP alleles nomenclature website \n(http:\/\/www.imm.ki.se\/CYPalleles\/) includes details of polymorphisms present within \nthe CYP family of genes, along with biological significance, prevalence and related \nliterature, although this information is limited to human alleles. \n \nSummary \nThe emergence of high throughput sequencing has resulted in a vast increase in the \ninformation available to researchers in their quest to understand human biology. \nGenome sequencing projects provide information on where we have come from, with \nphylogenetic analysis helping scientists to examine the way humans have evolved to \ncope with their biological needs. Large scale sequencing projects have also revealed \nthe large numbers of splice variants used by biological organisms to further increase \nthe complexity of their protein pool, allowing humans to respond to variations in their \npresent environments. Finally, SNP analysis may give some hints as to where we are \ngoing, showing genetic variations that are fixed within the population, and their \neffects on an individual\u2019s disease predisposition or response to therapeutic agents. \n \n 23\nReferences: \nAndo M, Hasegawa Y and Ando Y. 2005.
