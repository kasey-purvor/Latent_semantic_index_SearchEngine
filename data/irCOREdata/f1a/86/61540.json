Analysis of Discovery data identified five groups of stations with characteristic 40 \nphytoplankton communities which were almost entirely consistent with the original 41 \nanalysis conducted by Hardy and Gunther (1935). Major groupings were located at the 42 \nwestern end of the island and over the northern shelf where Corethron spp. were 43 \ndominant, and to the south and east where a more diverse flora included high abundances 44 \nof Nitzschia seriata. Major zooplankton-station groupings were located over the inner 45 \nshelf which was characterised by a high abundance of Drepanopus forcipatus and in 46 \noceanic water >500 m deep that were dominated by Foraminifera, Oithona spp.,  47 \nCtenocalanus vanus, and Calanoides acutus. Stations along the middle and outer shelf 48 \nregions to the north and west, were characterised by low overall abundance.  There was 49 \nsome evidence that groupings of stations to the north of the island originated in different 50 \nwater masses on either side of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, the 51 \nmajor frontal system in the deep ocean close to South Georgia.  However, transect lines 52 \nduring 1926\/27 did not extend far enough offshore to sample this frontal region 53 \n 3 \nadequately.  Interannual variability of zooplankton abundance was assessed from stations 54 \nwhich were sampled repeatedly during 7 recent British Antarctic Survey cruises (1995-55 \n2005) to the region and following taxonomic harmonization and numerical 56 \nstandardization (ind. m\n-3\n), a subset of 45 taxonomic categories of zooplankton (species 57 \nand higher taxa) from 1926\/27, were compared with similar data obtained during the 58 \nBAS cruises using a linear model.

Introduction 71 \n            Decadal-scale links between plankton and climate have been extremely difficult 72 \nto observe in many of the world\u2019s oceans, due primarily to the short duration of the 73 \nplankton collections and the lack of concomitant oceanographic data from earlier eras. 74 \nHowever, the lengthening of such time series in recent years has enabled some insights 75 \ninto the climatic forcing of ocean ecosystems on these timescales (Hays et al., 2005). 76 \nAlthough such time-series are still few in number and generally have a temporal extent of 77 \n 4 \nconsiderably < 60 years, strong evidence for world-wide changes in plankton abundance 78 \nand community structure has emerged. Studies to date have emphasised the sensitivity of 79 \nplankton communities to climatic signals (Roemmich and McGowan, 1995; Planque and 80 \nTaylor, 1998; Beaugrand et al., 2002) as well as their non-linear response to 81 \nmeteorological variables such as cloud cover and wind (e.g. Fromentin and Planque, 82 \n1996; Planque and Fromentin, 1996; Taylor et al., 2002). Climatic fluctuations as 83 \nreflected in atmospheric models such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) may be 84 \nseen as a proxy for regulating forces in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  Evidence 85 \nsuggests that the NAO influences ecological dynamics in both marine and terrestrial 86 \necosystems and its effects may be seen in variation at the individual, population and 87 \ncommunity levels (Ottersen et al., 2001).   88 \nClimate variability in the Southern Ocean is characterised by a number of coupled 89 \nmodes of variability in addition to secular change. Of the former, El Ni\u00f1o-Southern 90 \nOscillation (ENSO) events have been particularly highlighted as significant forcing 91 \nagents of ecosystem change (Stenseth et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2003).  Various links 92 \nbetween ENSO, ocean temperature and marine biology have been reported, with squid 93 \nstock recruitment, breeding performance and population sizes of seabirds and seals, and 94 \npopulation dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) being amongst the 95 \necosystems indicators influenced (Waluda et al., 1999; Reid and Croxall, 2001; Smith et 96 \nal., 2003; Ainley et al., 2005; Guinet et al., 1998; Murphy et al., 2007).  ENSO is known 97 \nto have a particularly strong influence on the Southern Ocean in the southern and 98 \nsoutheast Pacific sector, and through to the South Atlantic, where clear relationships with 99 \nsea-ice cover are evident (Kwok and Comiso, 2002; Stammerjohn et al., 2003; Meredith 100 \n 5 \net al., in press). In addition to ENSO, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) has more 101 \nrecently been identified as a key determinant of temperature in the Southern Ocean 102 \n(Meredith et al., in press). 103 \nSouth Georgia is an island located at the northeast limits of the Scotia Sea in the 104 \nsouthwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Figure 1a). As such, it sits within the 105 \nzonation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), with the Southern ACC Front 106 \n(SACCF) being located particularly close to the island (e.g. Thorpe et al., 2002; Meredith 107 \net al., 2003).  Interannual variability of ocean temperatures close to South Georgia has 108 \nbeen linked with ENSO events (Trathan and Murphy, 2003; Meredith et al., 2005; 109 \nMeredith et al., in press), and more recently with the SAM (Meredith et al., in press). 110 \nLong-period (decadal-scale) changes in the ocean temperatures around South Georgia are 111 \nalso evident, with a pronounced warming observed from the 1920s up to present 112 \n(Whitehouse et al., submitted). 113 \nDespite the growing understanding of oceanographic changes in this area, the 114 \ngeneral absence of long-term plankton data sets make it difficult to assess the impact that 115 \natmospheric\/oceanic coupling may have had on pelagic marine communities at decadal 116 \nand longer timescales.  To compound this difficulty, Antarctic marine ecosystems have 117 \nalready been subjected to dramatic anthropogenic change within the last century, with 118 \ndisruption of ecosystem function having occurred through the exploitation of whales and 119 \nseal populations and latterly through the exploitation of fish and krill stocks (Atkinson et 120 \nal., 2001).   121 \nThe earliest comprehensive sampling programme at South Georgia was 122 \nundertaken by Discovery Investigations in the 1920s as part of a series of commissions 123 \n 6 \naimed at gaining a greater scientific understanding of the whale stocks and their summer 124 \nfeeding grounds (Kemp, 1929). The initial survey, undertaken in December 1926\/January 125 \n1927, was described by Hardy and Gunther (1935) with one of their stated objectives 126 \nbeing, \u2018To describe the actual distribution of these species at the time of the survey for 127 \ncomparison with surveys in later years\u2019 (p.361).  Although further surveys were 128 \nundertaken in the late 1920s and early 1930s no explicit community comparison between 129 \nyears was made.  In the South Georgia region, whaling stations ceased operation in the 130 \n1960s, but commercial fisheries targeting fish and krill commenced working alongside 131 \ndense colonies of dependent predators. Soviet work on plankton and hydrography 132 \ncontinued in the region through this period (e.g. Bogdanov et al., 1969; Maslennikov, 133 \n1972; Vladimirskaya, 1978), with renewed interest in exploiting the living resources of 134 \nthe Southern Ocean (principally fin-fish and krill; Everson, 1977) during the 1970\u2019s, 135 \nleading to new research initiatives aimed at achieving a more general understanding of 136 \nthe Southern Ocean marine ecosystem (El-Sayed, 1994).  Pelagic scientific research, once 137 \nagain aimed at understanding the plankton and its interactions with predators with a focus 138 \naround South Georgia, recommenced in the late 1970s.  During the period 1995-2005 a 139 \nseries of cruises undertaken by British Antarctic Survey (BAS) around South Georgia 140 \nprovided plankton data with which we can assess interannual variability and that we can 141 \ncompare to the initial survey results obtained some 70-80 years previously.  142 \nOur objectives in making a comparison were first to investigate patterns of community 143 \ndistribution in the early samples and to compare these with our recent understanding of 144 \nthe ecosystem, and second to test whether there was any evidence that the plankton had 145 \nchanged in either a qualitative or quantitative way in the intervening period.  146 \n 7 \n 147 \n2. Methods 148 \nThe 1926\/27 survey comprised a series of 7 transects (Fig. 1b), along which 149 \nstations were located at approximately 10 nautical mile intervals. These commenced 5 150 \nmiles from the coast and ended when soundings of 1000 m or more were encountered. 151 \nStations along transects were sampled by two ships, namely the Discovery and William 152 \nScoresby. Stations along transects A-E were worked on the north side of the island 153 \nbetween 17\nth\n-23\nrd\n December 1926 and stations along transects F and G, on the southern 154 \nside of the island, between 7\nth\n-21\nst\n January 1927 (Fig. 1b). In the January survey, line B 155 \n(first surveyed in December) was extended to include stations B4 (2) and B9, the latter 156 \nsome way north of the other stations but which we have included in our analysis, making 157 \na total of 46 stations. Data obtained during 7 BAS cruises around South Georgia (Fig. 1c 158 \nand Fig. 2), undertaken during December and January within the period 1995-2005 were 159 \ncompared with Discovery data. Although regional coverage differed between cruises, and 160 \nno one cruise gave a synoptic view of the entire shelf and surrounding ocean, samples 161 \nwere collectively obtained within the same general area. Sample numbers within cruises 162 \nvaried from 11- 57 with a total of 189 stations across all 7 cruises. 163 \n 164 \n2.1 Physical Oceanography 165 \nAt the Discovery stations, hydrographic measurements were made at standard 166 \ndepths using water bottles (Nansen-Petterson and Ekman reversing bottles) (Kemp et al., 167 \n1929).   Temperature was read via a thermometer inserted into the top of the insulated 168 \nwater chamber in the former and by reversing thermometers in the latter. Salinity was 169 \n 8 \ndetermined by titration against a solution of silver nitrate of known strength. 170 \nTemperatures and salinities are accurate to +\/- 0.01 deg C and 0.01 respectively. 171 \nContemporary physical oceanographic data were collected with Conductivity-172 \nTemperature-Depth (CTD) instruments, namely a Neil Brown Mk IIIB CTD (prior to 173 \n1999) and a SeaBird 911plus (1999 onwards). CTD salinities were calibrated using 174 \ndiscrete samples drawn from a 12 bottle rosette and analysed on a Guildline Autosal 8400 175 \n(prior to 1999) and 8400B (1999 onwards). CTD potential temperatures and salinities are 176 \naccurate to +\/- 0.002 degC and 0.002 respectively. 177 \n 178 \n2.2 Sample collection and treatment 179 \nDuring the course of the Discovery survey three types of net were employed, a 50 180 \ncm dia net (N50V) used to capture phytoplankton, constructed with 200 meshes per linear 181 \ninch (mpi), equivalent to ~60 \u03bcm, a 70 cm dia net (N70V) used to sample 182 \nmesozooplankton and made with 2 grades of silk netting 40 mpi ( ~350 \u03bcm)  in the 183 \nforemost part and 74 mpi (~200 \u03bcm) behind, and a coarser net of 1m dia (N100H) with 184 \nmesh openings of up to 4 mm in the main part of the net, which sampled macroplankton 185 \nwhilst being towed horizontally at 2 kts.  Information regarding net construction and 186 \ndeployment are provided by Kemp et al. (1929). All 3 nets were deployed at full routine 187 \nstations, but here we are concerned only with the N50V which was lowered to 100 m and 188 \nthen hauled vertically to the surface at 1 m sec\n-1\n, and the N70V which was equipped with 189 \na throttling rope and messenger system and so could be used to fish discrete depth 190 \nhorizons. Dependent on water depth, up to 6 samples were obtained as follows, 50 m to 191 \nsurface, 100-50 m, 250-100 m, 500-250 m, 750-500 m and 1000-750 m.   Samples from 192 \n 9 \nboth nets were preserved in formalin. In the laboratory, the N50V samples were diluted to 193 \na definite volume, 50, 100 or 150 ml according to bulk and then sub-sampled with a 0.5 194 \nml stempel pipette. In extreme cases further dilutions were necessary. The contents of the 195 \npipette were then placed into a slide counting chamber and examined under a microscope 196 \nusing a 2\/3in objective (equivalent to a primary magnification of 10x) or if small forms 197 \ndominated a 1\/6in objective was used (equivalent to a primary magnification of about 198 \n42x) (Dr Brian Bracegirdle pers comm.). Coupled with a 10x eyepiece this would have 199 \nprovided 100x and 420x magnification respectively, which is comparable to that used in 200 \nsimilar analyses undertaken today.  N70V analysis consisted of removing larger 201 \norganisms (>2 mm) from samples followed by an examination for rarer taxa before sub-202 \nsampling with a stempel pipette. Full details are provided in Hardy and Gunther (1935).  203 \nOverall data from a total of 43 stations were used in the N50V and 46 for the N70V 204 \nanalyses. 205 \n During 7 BAS cruises mesozooplankton were sampled with a paired bongo net of 206 \n0.62 m dia equipped with a 200 \u03bcm net which was deployed vertically from 200 m (or 207 \nnear bottom if water depth <200 m) to the surface. Numbers of samples across cruises 208 \nvaried from 11-57 (total n =189 across 7 cruises) and were restricted to those taken 209 \nwithin the region sampled by the 1926\/27 Discovery surveys. Samples were preserved in 210 \nformalin and analysed according to protocols detailed in Ward et al. (2005). 211 \n 212 \n2.3 Taxonomic issues 213 \nBefore data analysis commenced a number of taxonomic inconsistencies needed 214 \nto be resolved between the Discovery and BAS samples.  Foremost was the identification 215 \n 10 \nby Andrew Scott, who analysed the copepod fraction of the Discovery samples, of the 216 \nmost abundant species of Oithona (Copepoda:Cyclopoida) taken around South Georgia in 217 \n1926\/27 as Oithona frigida, and the observation that Oithona similis, which is abundant 218 \nthroughout much of the World\u2019s Oceans, including the Southern Ocean (Atkinson, 1998; 219 \nGalliene and Robins, 2001; Ward and Hirst, 2007), was only encountered at one station 220 \nnorth of the Polar Front.  Hardy and Gunther (1935) also thought this curious (p189), as 221 \ndid Vervoort (1951), particularly as O. similis had previously been widely recorded 222 \nbetween New Zealand and the Antarctic continent by Farran (1929).  To clarify this we 223 \nexamined 0-50 m samples from four Discovery stations (1201, 1202, 1204, 1211) taken 224 \naround South Georgia in November\/December 1933 to see which species was abundant 225 \nand found only O. similis.  We therefore think it highly probable that O. similis Claus 226 \n(1866) was identified erroneously as O. frigida Giesbrecht (1902).  Oithona similis is by 227 \nfar the commonest species identified in contemporary collections around South Georgia 228 \nand elsewhere in the Southern Ocean (Metz, 1996), and it seems inconceivable that such 229 \na major shift in distribution occurred in the 7 years following 1926\/27.  However, 230 \nhereafter we refer to both species as Oithona spp. although O. similis greatly 231 \noutnumbered O. frigida in BAS collections.  Other taxonomic issues generally involve 232 \nthe renaming of taxa in the 80 years that have elapsed since Scott\u2019s analysis. Drepanopus 233 \npectinatus at South Georgia is now recognised as Drepanopus forcipatus, the former only 234 \noccurring at islands in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean (Hulsemann, 1985).  235 \nEucalanus acus Farran (1929) is now Subeucalanus longiceps Matthews (1925) (Razouls, 236 \n1995).  Microcalanus  pygmaeus and Microcalanus sp. were considered by Scott to be 237 \ntwo separate species. However, Vervoort (1957) considers that only a single species 238 \n 11 \nexists, and we have accordingly pooled Discovery counts as M. pygmaeus. Within BAS 239 \ncollections we have only recognised a single species.  Clausocalanus arcuicornis, listed 240 \nas present at South Georgia in 1926\/27 is presently widespread in tropical and subtropical 241 \nwaters  (Bradford-Grieve et al., 1999) and was therefore probably mistakenly identified. 242 \nWe have elected to keep the category Clausocalanus sp. as there is one other species 243 \n(Clausocalanus brevipes) which has been occasionally encountered around South 244 \nGeorgia in recent collections. Within euphausiid species, adult and cyrtopia stages (stage 245 \nsubsequent to furcilia and pre-adult see Dilwyn John, 1936) were combined into a single 246 \npostlarval category (adult\/subadult). In the case of Thysan\u00f6essa vicina and T. macrura, 247 \nwhich are extremely difficult to tell apart (Ward et al., 1990), and in which furcilia are 248 \nfrequently damaged during sampling, both species and furcilia were pooled into a single 249 \nThysanoessa spp. category.  Salpa fusiformis var. aspera Chamisso (1819) is now 250 \nrecognised as S. thompsoni Foxton (1961). 251 \n 252 \n2.4 Data treatment 253 \nDiscovery net catch data are provided in Appendices I (Phytoplankton) and II 254 \n(Zooplankton Table1) of Discovery Report 11 (Hardy and Gunther, 1935).  255 \nOnly the most \u2018important\u2019 taxa were included in the phytoplankton table and total sample 256 \nestimates were provided along with an indication of the fraction examined so that the 257 \nreader can make their own assessment of the numbers counted (Hardy and Gunther, 258 \n1935).  A total of 32 phytoplankton taxa are provided in the table out of a total of 90 taxa 259 \nrecorded during the survey.  Likewise for the N70V zooplankton samples, total catch data 260 \n 12 \nare provided for the 54 most abundant taxa and the distribution of less important species 261 \nis given in the text.  262 \nFor the current analysis data from both tables were input into taxa by station 263 \nmatrices and in the case of the zooplankton, those less abundant species indicated in the 264 \ntext were also included, giving a total of 73 taxa.  To facilitate a comparison of the 265 \nDiscovery and BAS zooplankton data we grouped the former into categories routinely 266 \nused in the analysis of BAS data.  We achieved this by aggregating some species into 267 \nhigher taxonomic groupings, resulting in a total of 55 compatible categories (see 268 \nAppendix II).  However, a number of Discovery taxa were not counted in the BAS 269 \nsamples, notably Foraminiferans and Radiolarians, which collectively contributed around 270 \n7% of total abundance. They were left in the zooplankton matrix for the initial 271 \ncommunity analysis of the Discovery data but were omitted from later comparisons (see 272 \nbelow).  273 \n  274 \nDiscovery phytoplankton counts were directly input into the matrix as each net 275 \nroutinely fished to 100 m. Abundances of Discovery zooplankton catch data (per m\n-3\n) 276 \nwere integrated from surface to 250 m (or near bottom if shallower) prior to analysis. 277 \nBAS data sampled within the top 200 m (or near bottom if shallower) was standardised in 278 \nthe same way. Any depth mismatch between the two data sets is unlikely to result in 279 \nsystematic error as during the summer months most of the plankton around South 280 \nGeorgia is located within the top 200 m (Ward et al 1995).  281 \n 282 \n 13 \nIn order to characterise and assess the depth distribution of the plankton in 1926\/27, four 283 \nlarge interzonal calanoid copepods, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Calanus 284 \nsimillimus and Calanus propinquus were chosen and a comparison was made by 285 \naveraging across 13 Discovery hauls taken in water > 750 m deep. The proportion of 286 \nspecies populations resident in the top 250 m was then compared with similar data 287 \nobtained from a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) during a cruise to the area 288 \nundertaken in January 1990 (Ward et al., 1995). 289 \n 290 \n2.5 Data analysis 291 \nPhytoplankton cell counts and mesozooplankton data were initially analysed 292 \nindependently with the statistical package PRIMER 5 (Primer-E Ltd).  In both analyses 293 \ndata were restricted to those taxa that contributed \u2265 2% abundance at any of the stations. 294 \nFor phytoplankton this procedure reduced the number of taxa from 32 to 18 and for 295 \nzooplankton from 55 taxa to 24. Cell counts and standardised (ind. m\n-3\n) zooplankton data 296 \nwere then log10 transformed and subjected to q type cluster analysis based on the Bray-297 \nCurtis similarity and group average linkage classification (Field et al., 1982).  The 298 \nSIMPER (similarity percentages) routine was also performed on both data sets.  SIMPER 299 \nexamines how much each species\/taxa contributes to the average sample similarity 300 \nwithin, and dissimilarity between groups (Clarke and Warwick, 2001).   301 \nTo assess interannual variability we examined zooplankton abundance at a series of 6 302 \nstations, located at the northwestern end of South Georgia, which were sampled during at 303 \nleast six of the of the seven BAS cruises (see Fig.1c). Data from only 5 of these stations 304 \nwere available for cruise years 1995\/96 and 1996\/97. We estimated the variance 305 \n 14 \ncomponents for cruises, stations and the residual to assess which component influenced 306 \nour comparison most.   307 \n 308 \nThe statistical analysis uses a linear model in which the log abundance is expressed as a 309 \nsum of random effects for cruise, station and residual, i.e. if yij denotes the log abundance 310 \nfor the ith station in the jth cruise  311 \n 312 \nyij  = m  + si  + cj  + ij 313 \n 314 \nwhere m denotes an overall mean log10 abundance, si  is a random effect for the ith 315 \nstation,  cj is a random effect for the jth cruise, and ij is a residual random effect.  316 \nRandom effects are assumed to vary independently with zero mean and variances Vs, Vc 317 \nand Ve, respectively. The model was fitted using the statistical programme GENSTAT 318 \nwith variance components estimated by REML (Residual Maximum Likelihood).  319 \nIn comparing BAS and Discovery data we attempted to minimise spatial variation by 320 \nselecting BAS stations close to the original 1926\/27 Discovery positions as follows. 321 \nDistances between the Discovery stations and those sampled during the BAS cruises were 322 \ncalculated, and 40 km chosen as the maximum distance within which comparisons could 323 \nbe made. This choice reflected a balance of reasonable proximity without overly reducing 324 \nthe number of Discovery stations. Where two or more 1926\/27 stations had the same 325 \nmatched station in any one BAS cruise the nearest was used. This procedure resulted in 326 \n36 of the Discovery stations with a matching station in one or more of the BAS cruises 327 \n(see Fig. 2).  328 \n 15 \nComparison of abundances between the 1926\/27 and BAS cruises was then based 329 \non the above statistical model modified to allow the mean level in log abundance to 330 \ndepend on the cruise, i.e. m = m1 (j = 1; 1926\/27 cruise) and m = m2 (j = 2,\u2026,8; BAS 331 \ncruises JR11,17, 28, 38, 57, 70 and 116). The difference between cruises in the two 332 \nperiods d = m2 \u2013 m1 corresponds to a ratio of abundances R = 10\nd\n.   333 \n 334 \nIn addition we calculated the percentage similarity index (PSI: Whittaker, 1952; 335 \nRebstock, 2001) of taxa across cruises rather than make simplistic comparisons between 336 \nindividual species on the basis of their absolute abundance.  To achieve this we 337 \nharmonised Discovery and BAS taxonomic categories as follows. In addition to 338 \nforaminiferans and radiolarians (present in contemporary samples but not routinely 339 \ncounted, see above) other taxa were also either ignored, because they were not routinely 340 \ncounted in one or other of the analyses (e.g. copepod nauplii stages were not enumerated 341 \nin Discovery samples), or aggregated into higher taxonomic groupings (e.g. euphausiid 342 \ncyrtopia, a stage not routinely distinguished\/recognised in contemporary samples). A 343 \ncommon matrix of 45 remaining taxa resulted (see Appendix II) and the percentage 344 \ncontribution of each to the overall abundance across all stations within a cruise was 345 \ndetermined. This was deemed a robust measure as data were averaged over the entire 346 \ncruise area and would therefore integrate any interstation\/regional variability.  Initial 347 \nanalysis showed that the inclusion of Drepanopus forcipatus had a marked effect on the 348 \nsubsequent calculation of PSI.  We know that this species was present over the shelf in 349 \n1926\/27 as well as in contemporary samples but its patchy distribution across all cruises 350 \n 16 \n(0.3-45% of total abundance) was problematic, so to avoid any unnecessary bias it was 351 \nomitted from the data matrix used to calculate PSI. 352 \nThe PSI index is given as  353 \nPSI = 100 \u2013 0.5\u03a3|Ai \u2013 Bi| = \u03a3min(Ai,Bi), 354 \nwhere Ai\u2032, Bi  = the percentage of species i in samples A and B respectively. 355 \n 356 \n3. Results 357 \n3.1 Physical Oceanography 358 \nFigure 3 shows the potential temperature\/salinity characteristics of the 1926\/27 359 \nDiscovery Expedition data (marked as black crosses) in comparison with the recent series 360 \nof BAS cruise data (coloured lines). The water mass characteristics are typical of those 361 \ngenerally observed in this sector of the Southern Ocean (c.f. Meredith et al., 2005). The 362 \ndeepest (densest) layers seen adjacent to South Georgia have potential temperatures 363 \ncolder than 0 \u00baC and salinities in the range 34.65-34.67. This is Weddell Sea Deep Water, 364 \nthe densest component of the Antarctic Bottom Water that penetrates into the South 365 \nAtlantic by traversing the Scotia Sea. Above this lies the comparatively warm and saline 366 \nCircumpolar Deep Water (CDW), the upper and lower components of which have 367 \npotential temperatures as high as 2 \u00baC and salinities of the order of 34.70 respectively. 368 \nClose to South Georgia, Southeast Pacific Deep Water has also been observed (e.g. 369 \nMeredith et al., 2001), though this is most obvious in measurements of tracers (e.g. 370 \ndissolved silicate), and is not so easily distinguishable from CDW on the basis of 371 \npotential temperature and salinity data.  372 \n 17 \nAbove CDW lies the surface and near-surface layers that are commonly referred 373 \nto as Antarctic Surface Waters (AASW). During summer, when all the measurements 374 \nused here were collected, AASW can be as warm as 4 \u00baC at the very surface, but is more 375 \noften closer to 2 \u00baC. Below the very surface, summertime AASW includes a marked 376 \nsubsurface potential temperature-minimum layer at around 50-150 m depth; this is 377 \nremnant of the previous winter\u2019s deep mixed layer, and is commonly referred to as 378 \nWinter Water (WW). WW potential temperatures close to South Georgia lie in the range  379 \n-1 to 1 \u00baC, with salinities of approximately 33.9-34.0 (Figure 3).  380 \nWith regard to changing water mass properties close to South Georgia, it is 381 \nimmediately obvious from Figure 3 that the 1926\/27 Discovery Investigations data are 382 \ncold in the upper layers, specifically the surface waters and WW layer. The 1926\/27 data 383 \ncompare most closely with data collected during Jan-Feb 1998 (Cruise JR28; green lines). 384 \nOther recent data from BAS cruises are warmer, by 1\u00baC or more in the WW layer. We 385 \ncomment on the cause of these changes in section 4.1. 386 \n 387 \n3.2 Phytoplankton  388 \nThe results of the nearest neighbour clustering of Discovery phytoplankton data 389 \nare illustrated in Fig 4a.  and the corresponding geographical distribution of station 390 \ngroups (Gps) illustrated in Fig. 4b.  The results are similar to Hardy and Gunther\u2019s  391 \n(1935) grouping of stations which was most likely on a subjective basis (Fig. 4c).  Gp1 is 392 \nrepresented in our analysis by two stations, one of which was classified as an outlier in 393 \nHardy and Gunther\u2019s original analysis. They were both characterised by high abundances 394 \nof Rhizosolenia styliformis and Corethron criophilum (Table 1). Gp 2 was located at the 395 \n 18 \nwestern end of the shelf and species of Corethron; C. socialis, C. valdiviae and C. 396 \ncriophilum were dominant. Gp 3 was largely present over the northern shelf and was 397 \ndominated by C. valdiviae and Gp 4 to the east, on and around the edge of the eastern 398 \nshelf, where a more diverse flora was apparent (Table 1). Gp 5 was characterised by low 399 \nabundances of many taxa and included several near coastal stations.  An outlying station 400 \nin both analyses (B9, Gp6 in Fig 3b) was characterised by the presence of Chaetoceros 401 \nschimperianus. Phytoplankton biomass measurements during the 1926\/27 surveys were 402 \nrestricted to cell counts and settled cell volumes. Close congruence between these two 403 \nvariables existed with both highest in a broad swathe over the southern shelf with a small 404 \npocket of enhanced levels between transects B and C on the north side of the island.  405 \n 406 \n3.3 Zooplankton 407 \nThe results of the nearest clustering of the zooplankton data and a map showing 408 \nthe geographical location of station groups are shown in Figs. 5a and 5b 409 \nGp 1 (13 stations) was mainly located over the inner shelf and along lines E, F and G 410 \n(Fig. 1b). It was characterised by high abundances of Drepanopus forcipatus which 411 \naccounted for 58% of within group similarity followed by Oithona spp. (35%). 412 \nDrepanopus is typically a neritic species and its average abundance in Gp 1 is over 10 413 \ntimes greater than in all other groups with the exception of station 126 (Gp 5) which was 414 \nalso located over the inner shelf. As a result of its presence, combined average abundance 415 \n(m\n-3\n) was highest within this group (Table 2). 416 \nGp 2 (12 stations) comprised the outermost stations mainly located in oceanic water >500 417 \nm deep along lines C-G. Four taxa, Oithona spp., Foraminifera, Ctenocalanus vanus, and 418 \n 19 \nCalanoides acutus contributed 89% of within group similarity and these, plus many of 419 \nthe other taxa within this group, had higher average abundances than in other groups 420 \n(Table 2).  421 \nGp 3 (16 stations) occupied stations to the north and west of the survey area 422 \n(predominantly transects A-C) along the middle and outer shelf. Stations were 423 \ncharacterised by modest abundances of Oithona  spp., and Ctenocalanus vanus and 424 \naverage total abundance (m\n-3\n) across all groups was the lowest of the 3 main groups. 425 \nGp 4 (4 stations) were widely spaced and were characterised by extremely low average 426 \nabundances of Oithona spp. and also Ctenocalanus vanus.  427 \nThe relative abundance of zooplankton (ind. m\n-3\n) within the survey area is shown in Fig. 428 \n4c.  Highest abundances were seen at near-coastal stations towards the southeast of the 429 \nisland (mainly station group 1) where D. forcipatus was abundant. Elsewhere, lower 430 \nabundances were seen, particularly at stations affiliated to Gps 3 and 4 (See Table 2). 431 \n 432 \n3.4 Interannual variability and a comparison between Discovery and BAS data  433 \n  Of the total variation in log abundance at the 6 stations sampled across 7 434 \nBAS cruises, 32% was attributable to cruise, 9% to station and 59 % to residual variation 435 \n(Table 3) i.e. of the two components (cruise and station), cruise, although not as large as 436 \nresidual variation, was proportionately larger than station position. Variation between 437 \ncruises was statistically significant (F6,28  = 4.16, p = 0.004).  438 \nIn assessing whether the Discovery and BAS data differed we have firstly restricted our 439 \ncomparison to BAS stations occurring within 40 km of Discovery stations.   440 \n 20 \nIn this case the estimated difference was d = 0.60 (se = 0.33, p = 0.071) with 441 \ncorresponding ratio R = 4.0 (Table 3).  Note, however, that the p-value is likely to be too 442 \nsmall because the test is approximate as it ignores the uncertainty in the estimated 443 \nvariance components. A more conservative approach based on the 6 degrees of freedom 444 \nof the variance component for cruises gives p =  0.12. 445 \nA comparison using all the BAS and Discovery data (ignoring station effects) gives d = 446 \n0.48 (se = 0.37, p = 0.19) (Table 3). 447 \nA comparison of log10 mean abundance with respect to year of all stations sampled 448 \n(Fig.1c), those within 40 km of the Discovery stations (Fig. 2) and the nominal six 449 \nstations sampled each year to the NW of South Georgia during BAS cruises (Fig. 1c.) is 450 \nmade in Figure 6.  There is generally a close agreement between values within years, 451 \nparticularly with respect to the full data set and those matched within 40 km of Discovery 452 \nstations. The values for the nominal 6 stations sampled to the NW of South Georgia also 453 \nreflect interannual trends. 454 \n 455 \n3.5 Percentage Similarity Index analysis 456 \nThe results of the PSI analysis investigating whether differences in taxonomic 457 \ncomposition were apparent between cruises are illustrated in Fig. 7.  Here PSI values are 458 \nplotted as a sequential series starting from 1926\/27 and finishing in 2005. With one 459 \nexception, mean PSI value for all cruises ranged between 70-80%. PSI is strongly 460 \ninfluenced by the most abundant species (Rebstock, 2001) and the decline in the average 461 \nPSI during 1998\/99 was largely due to the presence of higher proportions of pteropods 462 \n(Limacina spp.) (average 28%) and a correspondingly lower proportion of Oithona spp. 463 \n 21 \n(26%). This cannot be construed as a systematic change as the mean value reverted to its 464 \nmore normal range following this anomalous year. 465 \nRank order of mean percentage occurrence across cruises is given in Table 4. 466 \nGiven that the PSI is strongly influenced by the dominant species it is possible that there 467 \nare more subtle changes occurring. For example the colder summer temperatures 468 \nexperienced in 1926\/27 (~1.5\no\nC < contemporary cruise data; Whitehouse et al. submitted) 469 \nmay have influenced the development of zooplankton populations.  In the absence of 470 \nstage frequency data in 1926\/27 we compared the rank order of abundance of 4 species of 471 \nlarge calanoid copepods across all cruises and found it differed in 1926\/27.  Calanus 472 \npropinquus, second in rank order in 1926\/27, was ranked a distant fourth in all 473 \ncontemporary cruises.  474 \nA comparison of the proportion of the large interzonal calanoid copepods resident within 475 \nthe top 250 m compared to the rest of the sampled water column, revealed a much lower 476 \npercentage of the R. gigas population present in the top 250 m in the 1926\/27 season 477 \ncompared to 1990, although it appeared not to have impacted upon the other 3 species. 478 \nWith the exception of Rhincalanus gigas, which had a lower average percentage in the 479 \ntop 250 m in Discovery samples, the remaining 3 species had similar proportions of the 480 \npopulation present in both years (Table 5).  481 \n 482 \n4. Discussion 483 \n4.1 Physical oceanography 484 \nWe investigated oceanographic conditions around South Georgia in order to assess the 485 \ncause and extent of physical change in the last 80 years. The upper ocean was ~1\no\nC 486 \n 22 \ncolder in 1926\/27 than in most of the more recent BAS cruises, with 1998 being the sole 487 \nexception. We do not believe that the warming observed is due to changes in the location 488 \nof the local frontal systems (in particular the SACCF) around South Georgia, since there 489 \nis no evidence from deep water properties (especially those of CDW) for such a shift, and 490 \nthese are the most reliable local indicators of local fronts (see Meredith et al., 2003, 491 \nfollowing Orsi et al., 1995).  In practice, our modern concept of the local circulation 492 \nsystem based on data from the 1990s\/early 2000s, with the SACCF looping 493 \nanticyclonically around South Georgia from the south before retroflecting to the east (Fig. 494 \n1a), is supported well by the 1926\/27 Discovery data. Thus, whilst nomenclature may 495 \nhave changed since the days of Deacon (1933; 1937), the flow patterns in this part of the 496 \nSouthern Ocean have not. This contradicts Hardy and Gunther\u2019s (1935) view that the 497 \ncolder parts of their survey were influenced by waters from the Weddell Sea. 498 \nAnother potential cause of the observed temperature differences could be 499 \ninterannual variability related to coupled modes of climate variability. In this context, 500 \nMeredith et al. (2005) discussed in detail the causes of the colder temperatures 501 \nencountered during Jan-Feb 1998 compared with other recent cruises around South 502 \nGeorgia, and concluded that they were caused by the strong El Ni\u00f1o event of 1997\/8. 503 \nBoth oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections were found to be important, and processes 504 \ncontrolling these teleconnections were elucidated further by Meredith et al. (in press), 505 \nwith emphasis on explaining the timescales of variability. Evidence for a similar event 506 \nduring 1926\/27 is equivocal. Using various proxies, Quinn et al. (1987) have found 507 \nevidence for an El Ni\u00f1o during 1925\/26, and the timescales of the oceanic teleconnection 508 \nare such that this could feasibly have influenced the region around South Georgia in 509 \n 23 \n1926\/27. However, examinations of various atmospheric measures of ENSO (including 510 \nthe Southern Oscillation Index, and individually the Darwin Mean Sea Level Pressure) 511 \nshows little evidence for such an event (Phil Jones, Climatic Research Unit, University of 512 \nEast Anglia, pers. comm.)  513 \n  A further potential cause of the observed temperature change could be a long-514 \nperiod (decadal) warming trend in this part of the Southern Ocean. This would be 515 \nconsistent with the observation that ocean temperatures around South Georgia in 516 \n1926\/27, although cold by present standards, were not unusually cold compared with the 517 \nrest of the sequence of Discovery Investigations to this region (1925-1937 inclusive; see 518 \nDeacon, 1977). Such a trend is also consistent with the work of Gille (2002; 2008) who 519 \nindicates a substantial surface-intensified warming around the circumpolar Southern 520 \nOcean since the 1950s, and Whitehouse et al. (in press) who compared all available data 521 \nfrom around South Georgia (including the Discovery data) and derived a warming in 522 \nexcess of 1\u00baC in the upper 200m in this region.   523 \nOverall, it seems that the apparent warming we observe is most likely due to a 524 \nlong-period (decadal) warming trend in this sector of the Southern Ocean, with the 525 \npossibility of some interannual variability also contributing. Shifts in frontal positions do 526 \nnot appear to be a contributory factor. The causes of the warming trend are explored in 527 \nmore detail by Whitehouse et al. (in press). 528 \n 529 \n4.2 Phytoplankton 530 \nThere was close agreement between Hardy and Gunther\u2019s station classification 531 \nwith regard to phytoplankton composition and that of the nearest neighbour clustering 532 \n 24 \nsuggesting distinct differences between station groups.  Hardy and Gunther (1935) linked 533 \ntheir station groupings to what they saw as the dominant water masses in the region ie 534 \nWeddell Sea and Bellingshausen water and areas of mixing between the two.  Of the 535 \nmajor groups, Gp2 and Gp3 were thought to occupy areas of mixing over the 536 \nsouthwestern and northern shelf areas respectively, whereas Gp4 was thought to be of 537 \nWeddell Sea origin.  Stations affiliated within Gp5 were located in coastal waters.  As 538 \nindicated above there is no evidence of the occurrence of Weddell Sea water per se 539 \nwithin the region, although a number of less common species of diatoms (see Hardy and 540 \nGunther, 1935, Fig. 36) are almost exclusively contained within the generally colder 541 \nwaters of Gp 4, suggesting a distinct oceanic origin, similar to the distribution of 542 \nzooplankton Gp 2.  In a later survey around South Georgia, undertaken in spring 1981, 543 \nTheriot and Fryxell (1985) and Priddle et al. (1986) both considered that large-scale 544 \nphytoplankton species distribution reflected the interaction of the ACC with the island 545 \nand the Scotia Ridge, upon which were superimposed small-scale factors such as nutrient 546 \navailability and grazing, imposing local variation.  A similar interpretation was proposed 547 \nby Froneman et al. (1997) for observations made during January\/February 1994.  The 548 \nexistence of distinct shelf and oceanic communities at South Georgia has been observed 549 \nby Ward et al. (2007) and differing distributions of dominant species Fragilariopsis 550 \nkerguelensis and Eucampia antarctica attributed to Fe limitation (Whitehouse et al., 551 \n2008). 552 \n 25 \n 553 \n4.3 Zooplankton 554 \nHardy and Gunther (1935) broadly contrasted the differences between coastal 555 \nplankton dominated by Drepanopus and oceanic waters with deepwater forms such as 556 \nMetridia and Scolecithricella.  Their hypothesis that the phytoplankton groups might 557 \nhave characteristic faunas associated with them was confounded to an extent by what was 558 \nseen as the \u2018remarkable sameness\u2019 of the zooplankton with respect to the phytoplankton 559 \ngroups.  The major groupings of stations identified by nearest neighbour clustering of 560 \nzooplankton data are, however, consistent with many of the more recent surveys carried 561 \nout around South Georgia.  Shelf groupings of stations, often characterized by D. 562 \nforcipatus have been observed previously (e.g. Atkinson and Peck, 1988; Ward et al., 563 \n2002; 2005; 2007) although its patchy distribution and interannual variation in abundance 564 \nmeans that it does not always dominate in the way that it did Gp1 in the 1926\/27 survey.  565 \nThe shelf at South Georgia is extensive and it has been suggested that slow flow and 566 \nlimited exchange with oceanic waters can lead to a build up of production (Atkinson and 567 \nPeck, 1988; Meredith et al., 2005) which can be retained over the shelf for periods in 568 \nexcess of 3 months (Ward et al., 2007). To the north of the island, groupings of stations 569 \nconsistent with different water masses either side of the SACCF have also been observed 570 \n(Ward et al 2002; 2005), although in 1926\/27 transect lines did not extend far enough 571 \noffshore to cross the frontal region.  There was nonetheless a degree of congruence 572 \nbetween phytoplankton and zooplankton station groups as determined by nearest 573 \nneighbour clusterings.  Although zooplankton Gp1, largely reflecting the dominance of 574 \nD. forcipatus, comprised stations that were variously affiliated to phytoplankton Gps 2, 3 575 \n 26 \nand 4, there was a stronger correspondence between zooplankton Gp 3 (n=16) and 576 \nphytoplankton Gp 3 (n=14) which had 10 stations in common, as did zooplankton Gp2 577 \n(n=12) and phytoplankton Gp 4 (n=13).  This may reflect a common origin, in the case of 578 \nthe former groups, in \u2018mixed\u2019 water to the north and west, and in the latter, of oceanic 579 \nwater to the south and east.  However, it should be emphasized that primary and 580 \nsecondary producers will inevitably develop over different spatial and temporal scales, 581 \nwhich when coupled with advection in oceanic water, will tend to obscure relationships. 582 \nAs in all such mesoscale investigations, whilst differences between groups are often 583 \ndistinct they tend to represent variations in abundance of a common set of taxa rather than 584 \nmore fundamental shifts in community composition (Mackas and Sefton, 1982; Marin, 585 \n1987; Pakhomov et al., 2000). 586 \n 587 \n4.4 Interannual variability  588 \nThe analysis of inter-annual variability based on the six stations from the BAS 589 \ncruises showed that although variance attributable to cruise exceeded that due to station, 590 \nignoring station effects could lead to a confounding of spatial and temporal variation.   591 \nHaving  restricted  our comparison  with Discovery data to BAS stations lying within 40 592 \nkm of the original Discovery station positions to allow for spatial variation, large 593 \ninterannual variations in zooplankton abundance were still apparent which meant that 594 \ndespite having the lowest abundance across all years, data from 1926\/27 nonetheless fell 595 \nwithin the range displayed by contemporary data.   596 \n Low abundance in 1926\/27 may be partly attributable to differences in 597 \nequipment.  Although the N70V has a rear section of approximately 200 \u03bcm mesh, the 598 \n 27 \nfront section is somewhat larger at ~350 \u03bcm which could lead to an under-sampling of 599 \nthe smaller forms relative to the bongo net (200 \u03bcm mesh) used for the contemporary 600 \nhauls.  Equally the timing of sampling in relation to season and the developmental cycles 601 \nof the plankton will be reflected in abundance (see Ward et al., 2006a).  There is no 602 \ninformation on developmental stage structure available for season 1926\/27, although 603 \nbeing a cold year, population development may have been slow. 604 \nThe PSI analysis indicated that there were no obvious differences between 605 \ncontemporary data and that from1926\/27.  With the exception of cruise JR38 (1998\/99) 606 \nwhen the mean PSI value fell to just over 60%, due to high abundances of the pteropod 607 \nLimacina spp. in that year, it was consistently between 70-80%.  In comparisons of this 608 \nsort, survey timing and spatial coverage can influence results. As far as timing is 609 \nconcerned we have restricted our comparison to cruises that took place in either 610 \nDecember or January, although interannual variations  in zooplankton abundance were 611 \nvery apparent (see also Shreeve et al., 2002).  This is unsurprising given that the 612 \noccurrence of zooplankton at South Georgia results from the variable balance of 613 \nadvection and in situ production (Ward et al., 2007).  However the stability in taxonomic 614 \ncomposition observed at South Georgia further suggests that populations are advected 615 \nfrom source regions that are themselves stable in this respect. 616 \nSpatial coverage was also variable between cruises, with a greater proportion of 617 \noceanic stations sampled during BAS cruises.  It is possible that localized sampling may 618 \ninfluence regional estimates of certain taxa e.g. population development and hence 619 \nabundance of large calanoids was found to vary regionally during the course of at least 620 \none previous summer investigation (Atkinson, 1989).  Nonetheless given these caveats it 621 \n 28 \nappears that the mesozooplankton population has been relatively stable at least in terms 622 \nof the dominant taxa since the 1920\u2019s.  However, given that the PSI is strongly influenced 623 \nby the dominant taxa it possible that more subtle changes may be occurring.   By 624 \naggregating species into higher taxa a certain amount of information is \u2018lost\u2019 in the 625 \ncomparison but as can be seen from Table 4, relatively few taxa dominate the 626 \nmesozooplankton, the majority comprising considerably <1% of total abundance. 627 \nMany of the zooplankton found within the ACC have wide spatial distributions although 628 \ntend to reach maximum abundance within one or other of the various water types 629 \n(Atkinson, 1991; Atkinson and Sinclair, 2000).  Of the four main biomass-dominant 630 \nspecies of calanoid copepod, Calanus propinquus, which is more abundant within the 631 \ncolder parts of the ACC and was the least abundant of the four in contemporary South 632 \nGeorgia samples, was second most abundant in 1926\/27.  The significance of this finding 633 \nis unknown.  Its higher relative abundance in 1926\/27 may have been due to their 634 \npresence in colder water to the south of the ACC and\/or alternatively cooler water may 635 \nhave retarded the population development of the warmer water species Calanus 636 \nsimillimus and Rhincalanus gigas.  In summer these species are all largely active in the 637 \nnear-surface layers but the timing of the ascent of overwintered stages varies between 638 \nspecies, and also it appears, between years.  Ward et al. (2006b) found that the slow 639 \nretreat of the pack-ice edge in the Scotia Sea during summer 2003 was characterised by 640 \npopulations of over-wintered copepods compared to years when the ice retreated broadly 641 \nin line with the 25 y mean and a spring generation was present.  The absence of 642 \ninformation on population stage structure makes such observations difficult to set in 643 \ncontext, but in the only comparably cold year within the contemporary data series (Cruise 644 \n 29 \nJR28, 1998), C. propinquus was least abundant.  However, cold conditions in this year 645 \nappear to have resulted from an ENSO event propagating through Drake Passage rather 646 \nthan cold waters spreading from further south where C. propinquus is regionally more 647 \nabundant.  648 \n 649 \n4.5 Long-term change 650 \nWhilst physical changes in the Southern Ocean are becoming increasingly 651 \napparent and regional warming trends documented, particularly at the Western Antarctic 652 \nPeninsula  (Smith et al., 2003; Meredith and King, 2005;Meredith et al., in press), the 653 \nconsequences for the marine ecosystem are largely unknown due to the lack of long-term 654 \nstudies (Clarke et al., 2007). Convincing evidence of changes in population size and 655 \ndistribution of vertebrate predators has been demonstrated (Reid and Croxall, 2001; 656 \nCroxall et al., 2002; Ainley et al., 2005), in which commercial fishing pressure may also 657 \nbe implicated but impacts on the plankton are less clear. In contrast, extensive 658 \nclimatically induced changes in North Atlantic plankton communities over the last 40 659 \nyears, have been recently described by Beaugrand et al. (2002). Using Continuous 660 \nPlankton Recorder (CPR) time-series data it was shown that ecosystems of the northeast 661 \nNorth Atlantic have changed towards a warmer dynamic equilibrium whereas those in the 662 \nnorthwest Atlantic ecosystems have shifted towards a colder dynamic equilibrium, 663 \nparticularly in the Sub-arctic gyre.  In the Southern Ocean, krill abundance in the Scotia 664 \nSea has declined over the last 30 years and an increase in salps has occurred (Atkinson et 665 \nal., 2004), against a background of rising sea temperature.  The possibility of change 666 \nwithin the plankton elsewhere in the Southern Ocean has been suggested by Kawamura 667 \n 30 \n(1986; 1987).  He compared historical and contemporary N70V catches from the Indian 668 \nOcean sector and concluded that although there had been little change in plankton 669 \nbiomass since Discovery days, the abundance of large calanoids had decreased 670 \ndramatically.  However, this perceived decrease was principally based on comparisons 671 \nwith Discovery samples from South Georgia and the Scotia Sea where subsequent 672 \nresearch has demonstrated the presence of high standing stocks of plankton, particularly 673 \ncopepods, relative to other parts of the Southern Ocean (Atkinson, 1998).  In a later study 674 \nVuorinen et al. (1997) compared the spatial and temporal variation of copepods in the 675 \nWeddell Sea based on samples taken in 1929-1939 and 1989-1993.  Their comparison of 676 \nsamples taken with N70 (V) and WP2 (200 \u03bcm mesh) nets, while finding no change in 677 \noverall abundance between periods, did detect recent increases in the abundance of 678 \nCalanus propinquus juveniles and adults.  However, other changes were only marginally 679 \nsignificant and they concluded that overall there were no uniform and consistent changes 680 \nthat could be linked to environmental change; in particular with their hypothesis that a 681 \nputative krill surplus, consequent to the harvesting and demise of whales (Laws, 1977), 682 \nshould have trophically disadvantaged copepods.   683 \nThe consequences of over-exploitation of top predators in the Southern Ocean for 684 \necosystem structure and function are presently unclear (Croxall et al., 2002; Ballance et 685 \nal., 2007), as we have a limited understanding of what conditions were before sealing and 686 \nwhaling began.  Warming of the South Georgia ecosystem has taken place in common 687 \nwith other parts of Southern Ocean (Whitehouse et al., in press, c.f. Gille, 2002; Gille, 688 \n2008) and there have been changes in the abundance and distribution of many of the top 689 \npredators (Reid and Croxall, 2001), as well as more recent commercial exploitation of 690 \n 31 \nfin-fish and krill (Agnew, 2004). Whilst krill abundance has declined over the last three 691 \ndecades (Atkinson et al., 2004), this study is unable to conclude whether similar declines 692 \nin mesozooplankton abundance have taken place, although taxonomically the 693 \ncomposition appears stable.  694 \nThere is a lack of appropriate time-series in the broader Southern Ocean against 695 \nwhich change in the mesozooplankton can be gauged. However, there has been an advent 696 \nof new sampling initiatives (foremost among them the CPR; Hosie et al., 2003), aimed at 697 \nestablishing base-line measurements against which secular change can be viewed. These 698 \nare strongly welcomed, and we urge their continued implementation.  699 \n 700 \nAcknowledgements 701 \nWe acknowledge our many BAS colleagues who over the years have contributed 702 \nto the planning and execution of numerous research cruises to South Georgia and beyond.  703 \nWe also thank Geraint Tarling who kindly carried out the PSI analysis.
