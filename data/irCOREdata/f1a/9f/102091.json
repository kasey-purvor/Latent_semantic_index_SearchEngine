Part 2.\nUnsteadiness and the Benjamin\u2013Feir instability\nfrom the viewpoint of hydraulics\nBy T. J. BRIDGES AND N. M. DONALDSON\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK\n(Received 5 November 2003 and in revised form 15 March 2006)\nThe theory for criticality presented in Part 1 is extended to the unsteady problem, and\na new formulation of the Benjamin\u2013Feir instability for Stokes waves in \ufb01nite depth\ncoupled to a mean \ufb02ow, which takes the criticality matrix as an organizing centre,\nis presented. The generation of unsteady dark solitary waves at points of stability\nchanges and their connection with the steady dark solitary waves of Part 1 are also\ndiscussed.\n1. Introduction\nA curiosity in the theory of water waves is the gap between concepts in hydraulics\nsuch as mass \ufb02ux, total head, \ufb02ow force and criticality and concepts associated with\nthe time-dependent problem, such as the Benjamin\u2013Feir (BF) instability. On the one\nhand, it is well known that it is mean \ufb02ow that stabilizes the BF instability in shallow\nwater, and clearly mean \ufb02ow is analogous to a uniform \ufb02ow. On the other hand, the\nconnection between the hydraulic properties of uniform \ufb02ows coupled to a Stokes\nwaves and the BF instability has not been clearly established. The Whitham (1967)\ntheory for BF instability in \ufb01nite depth comes closest to linking these two concepts.\nThe Whitham theory produces the correct result for BF instability, but it does not\nproduce the parameter structure of uniform \ufb02ows correctly. Speci\ufb01cally, it treats the\ntotal head as a pseudofrequency which is associated with time dependence, so in the\nlimit as a steady \ufb02ow is approached, the connection with uniform \ufb02ows is lost (see \u00a7 7\nfor elaboration).\nLinking the properties of the time-dependent problem and the hydraulic properties\nof steady \ufb02ows turns out to be possible by putting space and time on an equal\nfooting whereby steady properties can be deformed in a natural way into the unsteady\nproblem. This idea formed the basis of the new theory for criticality presented in Part 1\n(Bridges & Donaldson 2006), and is elaborated further here for the unsteady problem.\nThe main result of this paper is that a steady periodic Stokes wave in \ufb01nite\ndepth, coupled to uniform \ufb02ow, is linearly unstable to long-wave perturbations if\nthe determinant of the deformed criticality matrix, N(\u2126), has a root with non-zero\nimaginary part, where\nN(\u2126) =\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u2202R\n\u2202h0\n\u2202R\n\u2202u0\n\u2202R\n\u2202k\n\u2202Q\n\u2202h0\n\u2202Q\n\u2202u0\n\u2202Q\n\u2202k\n\u2202B\n\u2202h0\n\u2202B\n\u2202u0\n\u2202B\n\u2202k\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n+ \u2126\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n0 1\n\u2202A\n\u2202h0\n1 0\n\u2202A\n\u2202u0\n\u2202A\n\u2202h0\n\u2202A\n\u2202u0\n2\n\u2202A\n\u2202k\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n+ \u21262\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0\n\u2202A\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 . (1.1)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n420 T. J. Bridges and N. M. Donaldson\nThe parameter \u2126 represents the stability exponent for the time-dependent problem.\nThe determinant of N(\u2126) will be called the stability polynomial. It is a quartic\npolynomial in \u2126 when A\u03c9 \u0002=0.\nThe most important feature of the above result is that the criticality matrix is at\nthe centre of the stability polynomial. For example, it is clear that there is a zero root\nof the stability polynomial if and only if the basic state is critical.\nThe new function A(Z) is related to the wave action, but is not precisely the wave\naction because it is evaluated on the steady problem. It is obtained by deformation\nof the variational principle for the steady waves, use of conservation of wave action,\nand then deforming back to the steady problem. All entries in the three matrices in\nN(\u2126) are evaluated on the steady wave. For example, to obtain A\u03c9, the basic steady\nstate is deformed to a modulated time-dependent state with frequency \u03c9, the wave\naction is evaluated on this deformed state, the derivative with respect to \u03c9 is taken,\nand then the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0 is introduced, resulting in a function of the steady-state\nsolution only. In fact, the wave action can be expressed in terms of the mass \ufb02ux of\nthe steady wave (cf. Appendix). The deformation and derivative provide information\nabout the susceptibility of the basic steady-state wave to unsteadiness (see Bridges\n2004 for a similar susceptibility argument arising in the stability analysis of bright\nsolitary waves).\nA sketch of how the theory proceeds is as follows. Consider a Hamiltonian PDE\nin multi-symplectic form\nMZt + JZx = \u2207S(Z), Z \u2208\u0001, (1.2)\nwhere \u0001 represents the phase space. In (1.2), both M and J are skew-symmetric\noperators, and S is a given smooth function. The symbol S is used in anticipation that,\nfor physical problems such as water waves and its model counterparts, coordinates\nare chosen so that S is the \ufb02ow force.\nThe steady part of (1.2)\nJZx = \u2207S(Z), Z \u2208\u0001,\nis a classical Hamiltonian system in the x-direction. With coordinates chosen correctly\n(cf. Part 1), systems based on water waves have three invariants\nSx = 0, Rx = 0, Qx = 0,\nwhere S, Q and R are precisely the physical quantities of \ufb02ow force, mass \ufb02ux and\ntotal head, and more importantly, in the Hamiltonian setting these bulk quantities are\nrelated to symmetry. Bringing the time-dependence back into the equation converts\nthese invariants to \ufb02uxes of conservation laws,\nSx + It = 0, Qx + Pt = 0, Rx + Ft = 0. (1.3)\nThe \ufb01rst of these is the conservation of impulse which is discussed in detail in Benjamin\n(1984). The second is conservation of mass, and the third is the conservation form of\nBernoulli\u2019s equation (the third conservation law is sometimes called conservation of\nenergy, but conservation of energy for water waves takes a di\ufb00erent form). Each\nof these conservation laws is associated with some symmetry via Noether\u2019s theorem.\nConservation of impulse is associated with translation invariance in the x-direction\nof the governing equations. Conservation of mass is associated with translation of\nthe velocity potential \u2013 that is, an arbitrary function of time can be added to the\nvelocity potential. Heretofore, the association of the third conservation law with a\nsymmetry has gone unnoticed. It is a hidden symmetry which becomes apparent\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSecondary criticality of water waves. Part 2 421\nwhen a potential is introduced for the free-surface elevation. This new symmetry was\nintroduced in Part 1 for steady waves, and is extended to the unsteady problem in \u00a7 2.\nLet A(Z) represent the wave action. Then, adding in conservation of wave action,\n\u2202tA + \u2202xB =0, to (1.3) leads to a set of 8 functionals: four spatial (the \ufb02uxes), which\nare central to the steady problem, and four temporal functionals, which come into\nplay in the analysis of the unsteady equations.\nTo motivate the importance of the embedding of the steady wave in the unsteady\nproblem, the linear stability problem is formulated for the steady waves of Part 1,\nwithout embedding. The required deformation will then arise naturally, and the theory\nfor this is given in \u00a7 \u00a7 4 and 5. The linear stability analysis for long-wave instabilities\nis then completed in \u00a7 6. The similarities and di\ufb00erences with the instability theory of\nWhitham are then considered in \u00a7 7. In \u00a7 8, it is shown that the stability polynomial\nobtained from (1.1) reproduces the classical stabilization of the BF instability due to\nmean \ufb02ow which occurs in the weakly nonlinear limit. Some comments on bandwidth\nof unstable wavenumbers are given in \u00a7 9. The \ufb01nal section gives an overview and\nsummarizes the results of Parts 1 and 2.\n2. A Boussinesq model for modelling unsteady criticality\nA Boussinesq model will be used to illustrate the theory of unsteady criticality.\nSince this paper will restrict attention to stability of periodic waves, the Boussinesq\nmodel with third-order dispersion is su\ufb03cient. An exemplar in this class which is\nsu\ufb03cient for the present purposes is,\nht + uhx + hux +\n1\n3\nuxxx =0,\nut + uux + ghx \u2212 \u03c4hxxx =0,\n}\n(2.1)\nwhere, to match the dispersion relation for water waves we require \u03c4 to be proportional\nto the coe\ufb03cient of surface tension (equivalently, proportional to the Bond number)\n(cf. Dingemans 1997, pp. 507, 515). (The presence of surface tension in the model (2.1)\nis not important for the later discussion of unsteady criticality or stability of water\nwaves, as the interest is predominantly in gravity waves. However, surface tension is\nstraightforward to include, and simpli\ufb01es the structure of the equations.) For some\nparameter values these equations are ill-posed and can be replaced by other members\nof the Boussinesq equivalence class. However, since the system (2.1) is used in this\npaper for illustration only, and the applications later will be to the full water-wave\nproblem, this ill-posedness is not important.\nExtending the idea of Part 1, a potential for both the velocity and the surface\nelevation is introduced,\nu(x, t) =\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u03c6(x, t), h(x, t) =\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u03b3 (x, t).

Then,\nthe fact that S(Z) is independent of \u03b3 and \u03c6 can be represented by the statement\nS(G(\u03b8 )Z) = S(Z), \u2200 \u03b8 \u2208 \u00022. (2.6)\nwhere\nG(\u03b8 )Z = Z + \u03b81g1 + \u03b82g2, \u2200 \u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82) \u2208 \u00022.

Long-wave stability of periodic waves on a uniform \ufb02ow\nIn this section, the linear stability problem for the three-parameter family of steady\nwaves introduced in Part 1 is formulated.\nFor simplicity of presentation, the theory will be developed in detail for the\nBoussinesq system in multi-symplectic form introduced in \u00a7 2, and then results of the\ntheory for water waves will be discussed.\nThe theory is in fact based only on the multi-symplectic form of the governing\nequations with the symmetries as discussed in \u00a7 2,\nMZt + JZx = \u2207S(Z), Z \u2208\u0001, (3.1)\nwhere M and J are skew symmetric, and \u0001 is the phase space, which is an inner\nproduct space, and for simplicity will be assumed \ufb01nite-dimensional here.\nConsider a perturbation of the basic state of \u00a7 5 of Part 1, that is, let\nZ(x, t) = G(\u03b8(x))[Z\u0302 + U\u0302 ] := Z\u0302(\u03b83) + U\u0302 (\u03b83, x, t) + \u03b81(x)g1 + \u03b82(x)g2.\nSubstituting this expression into (3.1) and linearizing about the basic state Z\u0302 leads to\nthe linear constant coe\ufb03cient PDE\nMU\u0302t + JU\u0302x = L( p)U\u0302 , (3.2)\nwhere\nL( p) = D2S(Z\u0302) \u2212 kD2B(Z\u0302),\ntaking into account that R and Q are linear functions of Z\u0302.\nFrom equation (B3) in Appendix B of Part 1, it is immediate that span{g1, g2, g3} \u2286\nKernel (L( p)) and we will take it as a hypotheses that the Kernel is not larger, i.e.\nspan{g1, g2, g3} = Kernel(L( p)).\nThe operator L( p) is a di\ufb00erential operator in \u03b83, and the coe\ufb03cients (for example\nD2S(Z\u0302(\u03b83))) depend periodically on \u03b83. Therefore in analysing the linear stability\nproblem, we take a class of periodic perturbations of Floquet type in the x-direction.\nLet\nU\u0302 (\u03b83, x, t) = U1(\u03b83, t) cos\u03b1x + U2(\u03b83, t) sin\u03b1x, (3.3)\nfor some \u03b1 \u2208 \u0002, and where Uj (\u03b83, t) are 2\u03c0-periodic functions of \u03b83.\nThe representation (3.3) is much weaker than a proper \u2018Floquet decomposition\u2019.\nThe Floquet decomposition states that every solution is of the form of an exponential\nmultiplied by a function of the same period as the basic state. Here, the aim is to\nshow that there exists at least one solution of the form (3.3), and since the periodic\ndirection is spatial, the solution should be bounded: the Floquet exponent should be\npurely imaginary and hence \u03b1 \u2208 \u0002, leading to the sin\u2013cos representation.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n424 T.

The analysis of the spectral problem (3.4) is\nsimpli\ufb01ed by noting that the block system is easily diagonalized. Let\nT =\n1\u221a\n2\n(\u2212iI iI\nI I\n)\n; then T\u2217\n[\n0 \u2212I\nI 0\n]\nT = diag(\u2212iI, iI),\nand so, by introducing the new variable W =T\u03b6 with \u03b6 =(\u03b6\u2212, \u03b6+), and multiplying\n(3.4) by T\u2217, it is block diagonalized to[\nL( p) \u2212 \u03bbM \u2212 i\u03b1J 0\n0 L( p) \u2212 \u03bbM + i\u03b1J\n](\n\u03b6\u2212\n\u03b6+\n)\n=\n(\n0\n0\n)\n. (3.5)\nHence the spectral problem decouples into two lower-order spectral problems which\ncan be solved independently. Therefore, the basic spectral problem is\nL( p)\u03b6\u2212 = \u03bbM\u03b6\u2212 + i\u03b1J\u03b6\u2212. (3.6)\nThe linear stability problem, for a basic wave in the family of steady waves interacting\nwith a uniform \ufb02ow of Part 1, reduces to studying the spectral problem (3.6). If there is\na solution \u03b6\u2212 satisfying the eigenvalue problem (3.6), for some \u03b1 \u2208 \u0002, with Re(\u03bb)> 0\nthen we say the basic state is linearly unstable or spectrally unstable.\nThe spectral problem (3.6) has a very nice structure. The operator L( p) is symmetric\nand it is the second variation of the constrained variational principle for the basic\nstate, M and J are skew symmetric and so iJ is Hermitian.\nA complete analysis of this spectral problem is beyond the scope of this paper, but\nby restricting to long-wave instabilities \u2013 that is, \u03b1 small \u2013 fairly complete results can\nbe obtained.\nTo determine the long-wave instabilities, the strategy will be to expand \u03b6\u2212 in a\nTaylor series in \u03bb and \u03b1, and then use the solvability condition for (3.6) to determine\nthe leading-order terms in the relationship between \u03bb and \u03b1. The leading-order Taylor\nexpansion of \u03b6\u2212 is\n\u03b6\u2212 = c1(g1 + \u03bbV11 + i\u03b1V12 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 )+ c2(g2 + \u03bbV21 + i\u03b1V22 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 )\n+ c3(g3 + \u03bbV31 + i\u03b1V32 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), (3.7)\nwhere the higher-order terms are higher order in |\u03bb| and |\u03b1|. Substitution of this\nexpression into (3.6), and using the fact that gj , j =1, 2, 3 are in the kernel of L( p)\nshows that the \ufb01rst-order (in \u03bb and \u03b1) terms satisfy\nL( p)Vj1 = Mgj , L( p)Vj2 = Jgj , j = 1, 2, 3.

Part 2 425\nThe term +Ker(L( p)) is an indication that an arbitrary element in the kernel of L( p)\ncan be added to the solution. However, these elements will drop out in the later\ncalculation and so are not made explicit.\nIt remains to solve for Vj1 with j =1, 2, 3. When j =1 the equation trivializes\nsince g1 is in the kernel of M. Hence we need to solve for V21 and V31 only. The\nequations L( p)Vj1 =Mgj for j =2, 3 are certainly solvable. They satisfy the solvability\nconditions, \u222e\n\u3008gi ,Mgj \u3009 d\u03b83 = 0, i, j = 2, 3,\nsince Mg2 =\u2207P and Mg3 =\u2207A and the functionals P and A are invariant.\nHow to solve for V21 and V31 without using brute force? It is precisely this impasse\nwhich suggests that we need to deform the basic state into the unsteady problem. One\ninterpretation of this deformation is that the stability problem requires information\nabout how sensitive the basic state is to temporal modulation.\n4. Towards criticality for unsteady waves\nThe key step in going from criticality of uniform \ufb02ows to criticality of Stokes\nwaves in Part 1 was the characterization of the basic state as a relative equilibrium.\nCriticality was then associated with a degenerate relative equilibrium.\nRelative equilibria can be extended to include time dependence, by embedding the\nrelative equilibrium in a multi-symplectic relative equilibrium (cf. Bridges 1997). To\nkeep technicalities to a minimum, the analysis is carried out for the multi-symplectic\nform of the Boussinesq equation.\nThe starting point is (3.1). The three-parameter family of waves of \u00a7 5 of Part 1 is\ngeneralized to\nZ(x, t) = G(\u03b8 (x, t))Z\u0302 := Z\u0302(\u03b83) + \u03b81(x, t)g1 + \u03b82(x, t)g2, (4.1)\nwith \u03b81, \u03b82 and \u03b83 a\ufb03ne functions of both x and t ,\n\u03b81(x, t) = h0x + bt + \u03b8\n0\n1 , \u03b82(x, t) = u0x + at + \u03b8\n0\n2 , \u03b83(x, t) = kx + \u03c9t + \u03b8\n0\n3 .\nThe parameters \u03b801 , \u03b8\n0\n2 and \u03b8\n0\n3 are arbitrary phase constants, and (a, b, \u03c9) are the\ngeneralized speed along the group associated with the time direction.\nFor the Boussinesq model and water waves, it is found a posteriori that b=0.\nThe parameter b is zero because the conservation law for total head has only one\ncomponent (a \ufb02ux only). Therefore set b=0 from the outset.\nThe space-time properties are now coupled. To determine (Z\u0302, p, \u03c9, a), substitute\n(4.1) in (3.1) to \ufb01nd\n\u2207S(Z\u0302) = h0\u2207R(Z\u0302) + u0\u2207Q(Z\u0302) + k\u2207B(Z\u0302) + aMg2 + \u03c9M \u2202Z\u0302\n\u2202\u03b83\n. (4.2)\nBut,\nMg2 = \u2207P (Z\u0302) with P (Z\u0302) =\n\u222e\n\u3008Mg2, Z\u0302\u3009 d\u03b83,\nM\n\u2202Z\u0302\n\u2202\u03b83\n= \u2207A(Z\u0302) with A(Z\u0302) =\n\u222e\n1\n2\n\u2329\nM\n\u2202Z\u0302\n\u2202\u03b83\n, Z\u0302\n\u232a\nd\u03b83.\nHence the program is the same as before, we merely have additional Lagrange\nmultipliers. The function Z\u0302(\u03b83) is obtained as a critical point of S restricted to level\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n426 T. J. Bridges and N.

For both the Boussinesq model\nand the full water-wave problem, the matrix in (4.3) can be simpli\ufb01ed. For example,\nin the Boussinesq model, the functional P (Z\u0302) takes the form\nP (Z\u0302) =\n\u222e\n\u3008Mg2, Z\u0302\u3009 d\u03b83 =\n\u222e\nh\u0302(\u03b83) d\u03b83.\nBut h\u0302(\u03b83) is periodic, and the mean value of h\u0302(\u03b83) is h0. Hence P (Z\u0302)=h0. (A\nsimilar result holds for water waves.) Therefore the non-degeneracy condition in (4.3)\nsimpli\ufb01es to\n0 \u0002= det\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\nRh Ru Rk R\u03c9 1\nQh Qu Qk Q\u03c9 0\nBh Bu Bk B\u03c9 0\nAh Au Ak A\u03c9 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 = \u2212\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202(Q,B,A)\u2202(u0, k, \u03c9)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (4.4)\nusing standard results for the determinant of a bordered matrix (e.g. Magnus &\nNeudecker 1988, p. 43), where subscripts are used to denote partial derivatives.\nThe class of solutions (4.1) is quasi-periodic in time when viewed from a \ufb01xed\nframe of reference, since there are two independent frequencies: \u03c9 and ku0, and the\ndrift along the potentials is linear in time. In the limit as a \u2192 0 and \u03c9 \u2192 0, this state\nreduces precisely to the spatially periodic steady wave on a uniform \ufb02ow. According\nto the above derivation, the time-dependent state is degenerate \u2013 and hence critical \u2013\nwhen the determinant condition (4.4) fails to be satis\ufb01ed.\nTo \ufb01nd whether the degeneracy in this case is signi\ufb01cant, we can evaluate the\nnon-degeneracy condition (4.4) in the limit as |A1| \u2192 0.\nExtending the weakly nonlinear analysis of \u00a7 5 of Part 1 to include the two new\nfunctionals P (Z) and A(Z), leads to a weakly nonlinear equation with D( p) of \u00a7 5 of\nPart 1 replaced by D( p, \u03c9, a), using the same symbol, D, for the extended dispersion\nrelation. Noting that to leading order A=\u2212D\u03c9|A1|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , the determinant in (4.4)\nreduces to \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202(Q,B,A)\u2202(u0, k, \u03c9)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = h0\u000b |A1|2det\n\u23a1\u23a3D\u03c9\u03c9 D\u03c9k D\u03c9Dk\u03c9 Dkk Dk\nD\u03c9 Dk 0\n\u23a4\u23a6+ O(|A1|4). (4.5)\nHence, for non-degeneracy we require h0 \u0002=0, \u000b \u0002=0 (which is already required for\nthe weakly nonlinear existence of steady waves), and a third condition based on the\nderivatives of D. The determinant in the third term can be related to the curvature\nof the dispersion curve, \u03c9\u2032\u2032(k).\nDi\ufb00erentiating D(\u03c9, k)= 0 (suppressing the other parameters in the dispersion\nrelation for this discussion, as only \u03c9 and k enter), and assuming D\u03c9 \u0002=0, then\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSecondary criticality of water waves.

(4.6)\nThe non-degeneracy of the determinant in (4.5) is therefore equivalent to \u03c9\u2032\u2032(k) \u0002=0\n(when D\u03c9 \u0002=0). Therefore if we consider the frequency of the form \u03c9(k)=\u03c90(k) +\n\u03c92(k)|A1|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , then sign(\u03c92)=\u2212sign(\u000b), and so\nsign\n(\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202(Q,B,A)\u2202(u0, k, \u03c9)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223) = \u2212sign(\u03c92\u03c9\u2032\u20320(k)) (4.7)\nfor |A1| su\ufb03ciently small. Now \u03c92\u03c9\u2032\u20320(k)< 0 is the Whitham (1974) condition for\ninstability of weakly nonlinear dispersive waves. Hence, it might appear that when\nthe determinant in (4.5) is positive, it signals an instability, and when the determinant\nchanges sign, it signals a change of stability, suggesting that criticality of the unsteady\nwave implies stability change. However, although the determinant (4.5) does enter\nthe linear stability problem, the stability analysis is more subtle and requires more\ndetailed study.

Setting this determinant to\nzero results in a function of the stability exponent \u03bb. Let \u03bb= i\u03b1\u2126 . Then the above\nmatrix equation can be written\n(i\u03b1)2N(\u2126)c = 0+ O((|\u03bb| + |\u03b1|)3),\nwhere N(\u2126) is as de\ufb01ned in \u00a7 1. For long-wave instability or Benjamin\u2013Feir instability\nwhere \u03b1 \u0002=0 but |\u03b1| \r 1, the stability analysis therefore reduces to the analysis of\ndet(N(\u2126))= 0. The analysis of det(N(\u2126))= 0 includes all instabilities for |\u03b1| + |\u03bb|\nsmall, but there is no restriction on the amplitude of the basic state.\nThe determinant of N(\u2126) can be expanded into the following quartic polynomial\ndet[N(\u2126)] = f0 + 2f1\u2126 + f2\u2126\n2 + 2f3\u2126\n3 + f4\u2126\n4, (6.4)\nwith\nf0 = det[C( p)],\nf1 =\n(\nRhQu \u2212 R2u\n)\nAk + RkQk \u2212 RhAuQk \u2212 RuBk + AhRuQk + RuRkAu \u2212 AhQuRk,\nf2 =\n(\nRhQu \u2212 R2u\n)\nA\u03c9 \u2212 RhA2u \u2212 Bk \u2212 A2hQu + 2RkAu + 2AhQk \u2212 4RuAk + 2AhRuAu,\nf3 = AhAu \u2212 Ak \u2212 RuA\u03c9,\nf4 = \u2212A\u03c9.\nFor brevity u represents u0 and h represents h0. The prominent role played by the\ncriticality matrix in this stability quartic is evident.\nGiven the functionals R, Q, B and A and their derivatives evaluated on the basic\nstate, the stability analysis for long-wave (\u03b1 \r 1) instabilities reduces to the analysis\nof a quartic polynomial. One can deduce general conditions on the coe\ufb03cients for\nthe existence of at least one root with non-zero imaginary part using the classical\ntheory of quartic equations, but we will not consider this here. In general, for large-\namplitude waves, these basic functionals and their derivatives would have to be\ncomputed numerically. In \u00a7 8, the properties of N(\u2126) applied to water waves in the\nlimit as the amplitude tends to zero are considered.\n6.1. Linearizing the deformed criticality matrix N(\u2126)\nThe \u2018nonlinear in the parameter\u2019 eigenvalue problem associated with N(\u2126) can be\nlinearized.

Comparison with the Whitham modulation theory\nThe Whitham modulation (WM) theory comes closest to capturing the connection\nbetween hydraulic properties of the basic state and the BF instability (Whitham 1967,\n1974; Hayes 1973). There are, however, two drawbacks to this approach. First, the\nconservation of total head is not represented, and this forces the WM theory to\ntreat total head as a \u2018pseudo-frequency\u2019, i.e. a temporal parameter. Secondly, the WM\ntheory is developed in a Lagrangian setting, and hence there is insu\ufb03cient structure\nto relate bulk quantities to dynamical properties of the equations in a precise way.\nThis problem is circumvented in the WM theory by deriving modulation equations,\nand then deducing conclusions from the analysis of these modulation equations; but\nthis approach carries with it the need to verify that the modulation equations are\nindeed valid.\nThe \ufb01rst problem can be eliminated by introducing a potential for the wave height,\nbut the second problem is intrinsic to the Lagrangian approach. The second problem\nis partially solved by Hayes (1973) by using a partial Legendre transform from the\nLagrangian to the Hamiltonian setting. The multi-symplectic formulation is analogous\nto a total Legendre transform, which puts space and time on an equal footing.\nThe WM theory starts with the Lagrangian for water waves and the potential is\ntaken in the form\n\u03c6(x, y, t) = rt + u0x + \u03c6\u0302(\u03b83), (7.1)\nwhere \u03b83 = kx + \u03c9t , and the wave height is taken in the form \u03b7(x, t)= \u03b7\u0302(\u03b83) (compare\nwith Whitham 1974, p. 553, noting that Whitham uses the symbol \u2212\u03b3 instead of\nr and \u03b2 instead of u0). These expressions are then substituted into the Lagrangian\naveraged over \u03b83, leading to L (\u03c9, k, r, u0).\nThe four key parameters in the WM theory are \u03c9, r which are temporal parameters,\nand u0, k which are spatial parameters. The parameter r e\ufb00ectively represents the\nBernoulli constant (or total head) in the WM theory. Associated with these four\nparameters are the functionals L\u03c9 (wave action), Lk (wave action \ufb02ux), Lr (mass\ndensity) and Lu0 (mass \ufb02ux). These functionals are used to derive conservation laws\nfor wave action and mass \ufb02ux which are then linearized and used to deduce an\ninstability condition. This theory leads to the correct result for instability of water\nwaves even with a mean \ufb02ow, but the connection with uniform \ufb02ow hydraulics is\nmissing.\nThe WM theory can be modi\ufb01ed to incorporate conservation of total head. This\ncan be accomplished by introducing a potential for the free surface, and adding an\nadditional pseudofrequency and pseudowavenumber, speci\ufb01cally, let \u03b7(x, y, t)= \u03b3x ,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSecondary criticality of water waves. Part 2 431\nwith\n\u03b3 (x, t) = h0x + bt + \u03b3\u0302 (\u03b83),\nand replace (7.1) with\n\u03c6(x, t) = u0x + at + \u03b3\u0302 (\u03b83).\nThen the averaged Lagrangian will be of the form L (\u03c9, k, a, u0, b, h0). The total\nhead is then Lh0 , and a modulation equation for total head arises naturally when\nvariations of the averaged Lagrangian with respect to \u03b3 are taken.\nWith this modi\ufb01ed form of the averaged Lagrangian, the WM theory could be\nrederived, leading to modi\ufb01ed modulation equations, which when analysed (linearized\nabout a representation of the basic steady state) should recover the stability theory\npredicted by the deformed criticality matrix N(\u2126).\nHowever, there is still the di\ufb03culty within the WM theory to relate the conservation\nlaws to the equations directly. This connection is established here by working in\nthe multi-symplectic framework which uses a set of symplectic operators to relate\nconservation laws directly to symmetry generators and the equations. Indeed, the\nmulti-symplectic framework can be used to derive the stability condition predicted by\nthe WM equations directly from the governing equations (cf. Bridges 1996).\n8. Instability of weakly nonlinear shallow water waves\nIn this section, the theory for instability of waves based on N(\u2126) in (1.1) is applied\nto weakly nonlinear Stokes waves in \ufb01nite depth.\nUsing the expressions for the weakly nonlinear waves in \u00a7 5 of Part 1, and the fact\nthat to leading order the wave action is A(Z\u0302)=\u2212D\u03c9|A1|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , the entries of the\nmatrix N(\u2126) in the limit as the amplitude |A1| \u2192 0 reduce to\nAh0 =\nD\u03c9Dh0\n\u000b\n, Au0 =\nD\u03c9Du0\n\u000b\n, Ak =\nD\u03c9Dk\n\u000b\n, A\u03c9 =\nD\u03c9D\u03c9\n\u000b\n,\nRh0 = g +\nDh0Dh0\n\u000b\n, Ru0 = u0 +\nDh0Du0\n\u000b\n, Rk =\nDh0Dk\n\u000b\n, (8.1)\nQu0 = h0 +\nDu0Du0\n\u000b\n, Qk =\nDu0Dk\n\u000b\n, Bk =\nDkDk\n\u000b\n,\nwith the rest of the entries obtained by symmetry.

Here, \u03bb= i\u2126 and \u2126 is a root of det(N(\u00b1\u2126)) = 0 with |A1|=0. The critical value\n(kh0)0 is approximately 2.\nHence \u2212Dk\/D\u03c9 is a root of multiplicity two, and there are two simple roots. The\nroot \u2212Dk\/D\u03c9 plays a role similar to a group velocity, but it does not equal the group\nvelocity for water waves in shallow water because \u03c9 is a modulation parameter here,\nspeci\ufb01cally \u2212Dk\/D\u03c9 = cg \u2212 u0.\nGoing back to (3.4) and (3.5), we see that in addition to det(N(\u2126))= 0 we have to\nadd the four roots of det(N(\u2212\u2126))= 0. This gives eight roots and they are plotted in\n\ufb01gure 1.\nThe only curiosity in this \ufb01gure is that there is a critical value of kh0 \u2248 2 at which\nthere is a triple eigenvalue. However, this triple eigenvalue is harmless and does not\nlead to instability, as the eigenvector of the simple eigenvalue which collides with the\ndouble eigenvalue is linearly independent through the collision. This can be seen by\nnoting that the roots of det(N(\u2126))= 0 are\n\u2212Dk\nD\u03c9\n< 0, \u2212u0 \u2212\n\u221a\ngh0 < 0, \u2212u0 +\n\u221a\ngh0 > 0\n(\nassuming u20 < gh0\n)\n,\nand the roots of det(N(\u2212\u2126))= 0 are the negative of these. Therefore, the triple collision\ninvolves a double root from one determinant and a simple root from the other, and\nappeal to (3.5) shows that there will be two independent eigenvectors at the triple\ncollision.\nThe algebraic properties of N(\u2126) in the limit |A1| \u2192 0 are as follows.

Part 2 433\nWhen |A1| is perturbed away from zero, the only way that instability can arise,\nstarting with the eigenvalue con\ufb01guration in \ufb01gure 1, is for the double eigenvalues at\n\u00b1iDk\/D\u03c9 to split and develop a non-zero real part. With an elementary perturbation\nargument, it can be shown that when 0< |A1| \r 1 there is a root of det(N(\u2126))= 0 of\nthe form\n\u2126 = \u21260 \u00b1 1\nD2\u03c9\n\u221a\n\u2212\u000b\u0302\u03b4\u0302|A1| + O(|A1|2), (8.4)\nwhere \u03b4\u0302 is the determinant introduced in equation (4.6), and \u000b\u0302 is de\ufb01ned in (8.3). It\nfollows that there is a root of det(N(\u2126)) = 0 with non-zero imaginary part (hence\ninstability) when \u03b4\u0302\u000b\u0302 > 0.\nThe form of the root \u2126 in (8.4) is con\ufb01rmed by using an elementary perturbation\nanalysis, with perturbation parameter |A1|, of the nonlinear (in the parameter)\neigenvalue problem\nN(\u2126)\u03b6 = 0, \u03b6 \u2208 \u00033,\nby taking \u2126 =\u21260 + \u21261|A1| + \u21262|A1|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , and\n\u03b6 = \u03b60 + |A1|\u03b61 + |A1|2\u03b62 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N(\u2126) = N0 + |A1|N1 + |A1|2N2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nwith N0 as de\ufb01ned in (8.2). A straightforward calculation then leads to D\n4\n\u03c9 \u2126\n2\n1 = \u2212 \u000b\u0302 \u03b4\u0302.\nIn Hasimoto & Ono (1972), it is shown that a model for the modulation of Stokes\nwaves in \ufb01nite depth is the NLS equation\niA\u03c4 + \u00b5A\u03be\u03be + \u03bd\u02dc|A|2A = 0. (8.5)\nThe coe\ufb03cients and properties of this equation are discussed in \u00a7 10. From the results\nof Hasimoto & Ono (1972) it is easy to check that \u00b5\/\u03b4\u0302 is a positive constant, and\n\u03bd\u02dc\/\u000b\u0302 is a positive constant. Hence the instability condition \u03b4\u0302\u000b\u0302 > 0 agrees with the\ninstability condition \u00b5\u03bd\u02dc > 0 predicted by the NLS model (Hasimoto & Ono 1972),\nwhich in turn agrees with the result \ufb01rst found by Benjamin (1967), and con\ufb01rmed\nusing the Whitham modulation theory (Whitham 1967), and rigorously demonstrated\nin Bridges & Mielke (1995).\nIndeed, the instability of weakly nonlinear Stokes waves based on the deformed\ncriticality matrix could be rigorously justi\ufb01ed using a modi\ufb01cation of the centre-\nmanifold theory in Bridges & Mielke (1995). Technically, the theory would go through,\nwith the only requirement being that the conservation of total head has to be\nincorporated which would increase the dimension of the centre-manifold from four\nto six.\nThe critical coe\ufb03cient \u000b\u0302 is the one that changes sign when kh0 = (kh0)\ncrit \u2248 1.36.\nFor kh0 < (kh0)\ncrit, the parameter \u000b\u0302 is positive. Since \u000b is negative for all kh0, it is the\nsecond term in \u000b\u0302 in (8.3), \u2329(\nDh0\nDu0\n)\n,\n(\ng cg\ncg h0\n)\u22121(\nDh0\nDu0\n)\u232a\n,\nwhich is due to the contribution from the criticality matrix with u0 replaced by cg ,\nthat stabilizes the Benjamin\u2013Feir instability.

The bandwidth of unstable wavenumbers\nA root of the determinant of N(\u2126) with non-zero imaginary part indicates the\nexistence of a band of unstable eigenvalues as a function of \u03b1 as shown in \ufb01gure 3.\nTherefore, this condition is a su\ufb03cient, but not necessary condition for instability. If\nall roots of the determinant of N(\u2126) are real, then there does not exist an unstable\neigenvalue for \u03b1 near zero, but there could exist unstable eigenvalues at larger values\nof \u03b1. When kh0 < (kh0)\ncrit, instabilities at larger values of \u03b1 are known to exist\nfrom numerical calculations (see \ufb01gure 2d of McLean 1982 and \ufb01gures 1 and 2 in\nFrancius & Kharif 2003).\nTo determine the bandwidth of the unstable wavenumbers, or to determine whether\nthere are instabilities with larger |\u03b1|, one can in principle expand the Taylor series of\n\u2206(\u03bb, \u03b1) to any order. This expansion is straightforward in the weakly nonlinear case,\nand leads to the well-known cuto\ufb00 wavenumber \ufb01rst discovered by Benjamin (1967).\nThe Whitham modulation theory can also be carried to the next order to determine\nthe cuto\ufb00 value. The extension of the WM theory to the next order is discussed in\n(Hayes 1973, p. 218) (called \u2018di\ufb00raction e\ufb00ect\u2019 there). In the weakly nonlinear case,\nthe details of this expansion were carried out in Yuen & Lake (1975) (see Fornberg\n& Whitham 1978, \u00a7 8), leading to a variational derivation of the NLS equation.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSecondary criticality of water waves.

Unsteady dark solitary waves\nWhen the critical coe\ufb03cient \u03bd\u02dc in the NLS equation (8.5) changes sign in going from\nkh0 >kh\ncrit\n0 \u2248 1.363 to kh0 <khcrit0 the type changes from focusing NLS to de-focusing\nNLS. It is well-known that the de-focusing NLS has DSW solutions, and so in the\ncontext of water waves, there are weakly nonlinear unsteady DSWs for kh0 <kh\ncrit\n0 .\nThe purpose of the present discussion is to contrast these solitary waves with the\nsteady DSWs discovered in Part 1.\nConsider the coupled NLS model for modulation of Stokes waves in \ufb01nite depth\nderived by Hasimoto & Ono (1972)\n\u22022\u03d5\n\u2202T 2\n\u2212 gh0 \u2202\n2\u03d5\n\u2202X\n=\ng\nk0\u03c3\n[\n2\u03c90k0 + (1 \u2212 \u03c3 2)k20cg\n]\n(|A|2)\u03be , (10.1a)\ni\n\u2202A\n\u2202\u03c4\n+ \u00b5\n\u22022A\n\u2202\u03be 2\n+ \u03bd|A|2A =\n(\nk0\n\u2202\u03d5\n\u2202X\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c3 2) k\n2\n0\n2\u03c90\n\u2202\u03d5\n\u2202T\n)\nA, (10.1b)\nwhere \u03c3 =tanh(k0h0), cg is the group velocity, \u00b5=\n1\n2\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032(k0), T = \u03b5t , X= \u03b5x, \u03c4 = \u03b52t and\n\u03be =X \u2212 cgT , and\n\u03bd = 1\n2\n\u03c90k\n2\n0\n\u03c3 2\n[\n(1 \u2212 \u03c3 2)2 \u2212 1\n2\u03c3 2\n(9 \u2212 10\u03c3 2 + 9\u03c3 4)\n]\n.\nThe function A(\u03be, \u03c4 ) represents modulation of the Stokes wave, and \u03d5 represents\nmodulation of the mean\ufb02ow. (The symbol A here is not to be confused with wave\naction. Since wave action is not discussed in this section there is no cause for\nconfusion.) Hasimoto & Ono eliminate \u03d5 by assuming it to be a function of \u03be only,\nthen (\ngh0 \u2212 c2g\n)\n\u03d5\u03be = C0 + C1|A|2, (10.2)\nwhere C0 is a constant of integration, and C1 can be determined from (10.1). The\nvalue of C0 is related to the choice of mass \ufb02ux (it can in principle also be a function\nof time), but it is customary to set C0 = 0 without explanation (see equation (4.4) of\nHasimoto & Ono 1972). Sedletsky (2005) has reappraised the theory of Hasimoto &\nOno without this assumption and without the assumption that \u03d5 is a function of \u03be ,\nand makes several interesting observations. However, the role of C0 is not important\nfor the present argument and so is set to zero. (See Bridges (2005) for a discussion of\nthe implications of non-zero C0.)\nSubstituting (10.2) into (10.1b) results in\niA\u03c4 + \u00b5A\u03be\u03be + \u03bd\u02dc|A|2A = 0.

Donaldson\nThere are no steady DSW solutions of this equation, but when \u03bd\u02dc > 0 there is a family\nof unsteady DSWs, with explicit expression\nA(\u03be, \u03c4 ) = ei(k\u02dc\u03be\u2212\u03c9\u02dc\u03c4 )\n(\n2\u00b52\n|\u00b5\u03bd\u02dc|\n)1\/2\n(k\u02dc + i\u03c7tanh(\u03c7\u03be )), \u03c72 =\n1\n2\u00b52\n(\u00b5\u03c9\u02dc \u2212 3\u00b52k\u02dc2). (10.4)\nwith the requirement \u00b5\u03c9\u02dc> 3\u00b52k\u02dc2.\nAlthough these DSWs are mathematically similar to the steady DSWs in Part 1,\nthey are intrinsically unsteady. The leading-order expression for the waveheight for\nsteady DSWs is\n\u03b7(x, t) = \u03b5Re(A(\u03be, \u03c4 )exp(i(k0x \u2212 \u03c90t))).\nThere are two frame speeds: the phase speed of the Stokes wave, and the frame speed\nof the DSW which is the group velocity, and further unsteadiness due to the e\u2212i\u03c9\u02dc\u03c4\nterm. In fact, the modulation equation of Hasimoto & Ono, and related modulation\nequations for Stokes waves in \ufb01nite depth are intrinsically unsteady, and therefore do\nnot capture the steady DSWs that are synchronized with the Stokes wave (cf. Bridges\n2005).\nThese unsteady DSWs arise because of the change in BF instability of the Stokes\nwave. According to a weakly nonlinear NLS analysis, they exist for kh0 less than\nabout 1.36. However, it has never been con\ufb01rmed analytically or numerically that\nthese unsteady DSWs are solutions of the full water-wave problem, and there are no\nknown experimental or \ufb01eld observations of unsteady DSWs.\nThe steady DSWs of Part 1 are steady relative to an absolute frame of reference,\nand can be found by direct analysis of the water-wave problem, or with model\nequations such as the Boussinesq equation. In the weakly nonlinear limit, they exist\nfor kh0 less than about 0.85. The steady DSWs have a simple physical interpretation.\nThey are Stokes waves with a region of localized modulation. In an experiment or\n\ufb01eld observation, they would most probably look like Stokes waves predominantly,\nbut would have a small region of modulation, as shown in \ufb01gure 1 of Part 1.\n11. Summary and conclusions\nCriticality is a central organizing concept in open-channel hydraulics. The purpose\nof the present work was two-fold: to generalize criticality to open-channel \ufb02ows which\nare spatially varying in the streamwise direction, and to identify the implications of\ncriticality for the physical system.\nHeretofore the only generalizations of criticality for spatially varying \ufb02ows have\nresulted in approximate methods. The generalization proposed here is exact for\nspatially periodic variation, with the principal example being wave formation on\nuniform \ufb02ows. The central outcome in the theory is the criticality matrix introduced\nin Part 1.\nThe justi\ufb01cation of the criticality matrix brings together ideas from hydraulics,\ndynamical systems, conservation laws, group theory, linear algebra, constrained\noptimization and Hamiltonian dynamics. However, the resulting theory of steady\ncriticality is very close to the physical aspects of the \ufb02ow and is easy to apply, being\nbased on four physically important functionals: total head, \ufb02ow force, mass \ufb02ux\nand wave action \ufb02ux, and their dependence on three parameters: mean depth, mean\nvelocity, and wavelength.\nOne of the principal motivations for generalizing criticality was to determine\nits consequences. For the steady problem, we found that criticality predicts the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSecondary criticality of water waves. Part 2 437\nmovement of eigenvalues in the linearization about a basic spatially varying \ufb02ow.\nUsing dynamical systems theory, we were able to deduce behaviour in the nonlinear\nproblem near the basic state as well, namely, the bifurcation of homoclinic orbits,\nwhich represent solitary waves with oscillatory tails \u2013 a form of steady dark solitary\nwave (DSW) \u2013 in the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld.\nApplying this theory to water waves showed that indeed secondary criticality is very\nrelevant to \ufb01nite-depth water waves, particularly at intermediate depths. We found\nthat secondary criticality occurs along branches of shallow-water Stokes waves on a\nuniform \ufb02ow \u2013 at low amplitude and for a wide range of parameters. The theory\nshows that steady DSWs play a much greater role in shallow-water wave theory\nthan previously thought. The theory is consistent with previous numerical work of\nVandenbroeck (1983) and Zu\ufb01ria (1987), and is consistent with the appearance of\nDSWs in the NLS equation for intermediate depths, although the DSWs in the NLS\nequation are unsteady. Our theory ties together previous work and provides a unifying\nexplanation for both the appearance of spatial Floquet multipliers passing through\n+1, and the appearance of steady DSWs. Both phenomena are a consequence of\nsecondary criticality.\nAs far as we are aware, the concept of criticality for unsteady \ufb02ows has never been\nconsidered heretofore. The framework for criticality proposed in Part 1, based on the\ntheory of relative equilibria, has a straightforward generalization to unsteady \ufb02ows,\nand an example of this theory was presented here in Part 2. The consequence of the\ntheory for unsteady criticality is a new perspective on the BF instability in shallow\nwater. Although it is known that mean \ufb02ow acts as a stabilizing in\ufb02uence on the BF\ninstability, the precise connection between the hydraulic theory of uniform \ufb02ows and\nthe BF instability presented in Part 2 is new.\nOther outcomes of the theory in the work which may have independent interest\nare (a) the characterization of the Bernoulli equation as a conservation law; (b) the\nidenti\ufb01cation of a symmetry which can be associated with the Bernoulli equation;\n(c) extension of the SQR-theory of Benjamin\u2013Lighthill to the SQR + B theory;\n(d) the general connection between uniform \ufb02ows, and other basic states in open-\nchannel \ufb02ow, with symmetry and relative equilibria; (e) the precise parameter structure\nof water waves in shallow water, identifying exactly three characterizing pairs of\nparameters in the steady case; (f) a framework where the e\ufb00ect of mean \ufb02ow on\ninstability can be systematically studied; (g) simple formulae for the qualitative\nproperties of bifurcating classical solitary waves and steady dark solitary waves.\nThere are a number of further directions that are suggested by the theory in this\npaper; one is to apply the theory to strati\ufb01ed \ufb02uids, where issues of criticality are\nparamount, and a classical view of criticality as a one-parameter problem fails. A\ngood starting point in this direction is two-layer \ufb02ows with a free surface, where the\nmethodology is very similar to this paper. For example, uniform \ufb02ows will have \ufb01ve\nfunctionals: total head and mass \ufb02ux in each layer, and \ufb02ow force. Uniform two-layer\n\ufb02ows coupled with periodic waves will additionally have a wave-action \ufb02ux, and\nso six functionals, with \ufb01ve Lagrange multipliers (mean depth in each layer, mean\nvelocity in each layer and wavenumber). We can see from looking at uniform \ufb02ows,\nthat the potential bifurcations and creation of solitary waves will be much richer.\nFor example, for uniform \ufb02ows, the (S,Q) curve in \ufb01gure 4 of Part 1 generalizes to\na surface in (S,Q1,Q2)-space, with cusp lines rather than cusp points. Therefore, for\n\ufb01xed total head in each layer, there are curves of criticality rather than points of\ncriticality. The potentialities and consequences of secondary criticality, bifurcation of\nclassical solitary waves and steady dark solitary wave, and instability of interfacial\nwaves, are manifold.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n438 T.

Expressing wave action in terms of mass \ufb02ux for water waves\nIn the stability matrix N(\u2126), the only functional which does not appear in the\nstrictly steady problem is the wave action density A.
