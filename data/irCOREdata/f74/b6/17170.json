Neighbourhood activists usually oppose these airports, mainly \nbecause of extensive noise pollution and emissions. Opposition obviously becomes stronger the \nmore central airports are located, since population density is typically found to be much higher in \ndowntown areas. As a consequence, local authorities are confronted with two conflicting interests, \nemphasizing the role of downtown airports as a location factor to attract businesses on the one \nhand and the necessity of protecting local residents\u2019 living quality on the other. The case of Berlin \nstands exemplarily for such conflicts. Political opposition to the scheduled closure of city-airport \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  2 \n \nTempelhof became large enough to enforce a public referendum, which finally failed. To make \nappropriate decisions, politicians have to rely on valid information about the extent to which resi-\ndents and businesses are effectively exposed to the external effects mentioned.  \nQuantifying (city) airport externalities, however, is difficult in practice as residents and firms \nhave no incentive to reveal the true (dis)amenties they incur from a nearby airport. Instead, they \nexaggerate (perceived) benefits and costs in a political bargaining process in order to seek \nrents.(Social) cost benefit analyses rely on large sets of assumptions regarding the cost of travel \ntime and noise, which are difficult to ascertain. Spatial property market analyses offer a way to \ncircumvent these problems. Following bid-rent theory, all kind of positive and negative accessi-\nbility effects and environmental externalities can be assumed to capitalize into property prices as \nthey affect the willingness to pay of the marginal buyer. An evaluation of urban property markets \ntherefore qualifies as a natural starting point of a welfare analysis of airport externalities based on \nthe revealed preferences of market participants. \nProperty price effects of airports have, therefore, attracted scholars\u2019 attention. Bell (2001) pro-\nvides a survey on the impact on residents\u2019 physical condition and introduces effects on property \nprices. Most empirical studies available so far focus on North America (Mieszkowski&Saper, \n1978; Nelson, 1979; Uyeno, Hamilton, & Biggs, 1993) or United Kingdom, where Manchester \nAirport has attracted much attention (Collins & Evans, 1994; Pennington, Topham, & Ward, \n1990; Tomkins, Topham, Twomey, & Ward, 1998). For Continental Europe evidence is available \nfor airports located in Oslo, Basel, Paris and Amsterdam (Navrud, 2002). However, with the ex-\nception of Weigt (2007), there is still little evidence available for German Airports. Surveys on \nthe empirical literature reveal that airports are clearly found to adversely affect property values \n(Nelson, 1980; Van Praag& Baarsma, 2005). Meta-analyses on hedonic price aircraft noise stud-\nies are provided by Schipper, Nijkamp, &Rietveld(2002) and Nelson (2004). An alternative ap-\nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  3 \n \nproach to the evaluation of airport externalities was used by Nitsch(2009), who analysed resi-\ndents\u2019 preferences as stated in a public poll conducted by opponents to the closure of Tempelhof \nAirport in Berlin, one of the airports analysed in this study.  \nThis article adds to the existing literature in numerous important ways: First, it analyses the ef-\nfects of three airports, Tegel (IATACode: TXL), Tempelhof (IATACode: THF) and Sch\u00f6nefeld \n(IATA Code: SXF) in one city. Two of the three airports (TLX and THF)are clearly city airports, \nwhereas most airports in the studies mentioned above are outside cities. Second, it investigates the \nimpact of airport externalities on three different submarkets. Two residential submarkets are con-\nsidered to assess airport effects on household utility: typically owner-occupied detached and semi-\ndetached houses and typically renter-occupied multi-family houses. The third submarket com-\nprises commercial properties. This facilitates the evaluation of external productivity effects, \nwhich have been the focus of less attention in the literature. Third, we assess not only negative \neffects related to aircraft noise, but also positive externalities arising from access to flight connec-\ntions, which we approximate using(weighted average) road network distances to airports. Al-\nthough we find strong evidence of adverse productivity and utility effects arising from noise ex-\nposure, the evidence is less compelling for positive accessibility effects. Nevertheless, estimated \nnoise effects can be biased if accessibility effects are not accounted for in empirical models. \nFourth, the impact of aircraft noise is estimated not only conditional on alternative noise sources, \nbut also in interaction with other sources. We show that estimated noise effects may be severely \nbiased if these interactions are not accounted for appropriately. Finally, we show how a simple \nregression-based interpolation approach can help to overcome data limitations by generating a \ncontinuous noise surface where only limited (discrete) data are available. \nWe use GIS tools and projected GIS maps to analyse a highly disaggregated dataset covering a \nbroad range of structural, location and neighbourhood characteristics. Our models use potentiality \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  4 \n \nvariables and include attributes such as neighbourhood historic quality, which has received little \nattention in the literature until recently. Where appropriate, we correct for a spatial auto-\nregressive structure in the price-generating process or a spatial structure in the error term by ap-\nplying SAR models. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section we \ndiscuss the airports within the study area in more detail. Section 3 discusses the empirical strategy \nand data issues. Results are presented in Section 4 and conclusions in the final section.  \n2.0 BERLIN AIRPORTS \nThe official inauguration of Tempelhof airport was in 1923. After complete redevelopment during \nthe national socialist regime, Tempelhof was clearly Germany\u2019s most important air hub with a \nmaximum capacity of 6 million passengers a year, exceeding the effective 1934 numbers by a \nfactor of thirty. These dimensions, the facility design and architectural and historical particulari-\nties have frequently been discussed (Carr\u00e9, 2000; Demps& Paeschke, 1998; Meuser, 2000; \nSchmitz, 1997). Tempelhof later became internationally prominent as Berlin\u2019s most important \naccess point for the 1948-49 airlift established to supply West Berlin residents during the Berlin \nBlockade. To provide the necessary capacity, two more airports were conceptualised, one of \nwhich was Tegel Airport, jointly operated by the French since 1948.  \nBy the mid 20th century, Berlin possessed a decent infrastructure for air traffic and was preparing \nitself to benefit from the rapidly growing market. However, Berlin soon lost its status as Ger-\nmany\u2019s pre-eminent hub, mainly due to the loss of market access following Germany\u2019s divi-\nsion(Redding, Sturm, & Wolf, in press). West Berlin became completely surrounded by the So-\nviet zone of occupation. While the most important West Germany counterpart of the airlift \u2013 \nFrankfurt \u2013 emerged as Germany\u2019s new pre-eminent hub, generating more and more traffic and \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  5 \n \ncontinuously expanding facilities, improvements in air traffic infrastructure in West Berlin re-\nmained relatively modest. \nAs no reserve space for extension of facilities was available in Tempelhof due to its downtown \nlocation, Tegel Airport was opened for civilian air traffic in 1960 to meet the demands generated \nby increasing national and international air traffic, and the fact that a flight connection was the \nonly way of travelling between West Berlin and West Germany avoiding border controls. In \n1974,a new civilian terminal in the south of Tegel airfield replaced the existing facilities which \nsubsequently have been used for military and governmental purposes only.  \nFollowing the inauguration of the new Tegel Airport, Tempelhof Airport was closed until 1984 \nwhen it was reopened mainly for smaller airplanes utilized by business travellers. Despite minor \nextensions during the following decades, Tegel Airport kept moderate size. Even experiencing a \nconsiderable capacity overload (Steinke, 2006), the number of served passengers at Berlin\u2019s Tegel \nAirport has hardly exceeded 13 million per year, a relatively small number compared to 52 mil-\nlion at Fankfurt or even over 67 million at London Heathrow in 2005. Figure 1 shows passenger \ntraffic at Berlin airports since reunification in 1990. \n[Figure 1 about here] \nAs noted above, the capacity of both airports is restricted by their central location and good acces-\nsibility. Compared to the city airports at Tegel and Tempelhof, the location of Sch\u00f6nefeld, which \nserved East Berlin and its surroundings during the division period, is remote. In recent years, \nSch\u00f6nefeld, which will be redeveloped as the new Berlin Brandenburg International (BBI) Air-\nport, has become much appreciated by low-cost carriers due to low operating costs. However, \nTegel continues being the most important airport for business flights and the only airport in Berlin \nto offer intercontinental connections.  \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  6 \n \nWhile Tegel Airport will continue in operation until 2011, when the new BBI Airport is scheduled \nto be inaugurated, Tempelhof airport was closed on October 31, 2008. The external effects of \nTempelhof Airport were judged differently by citizens: Some neighbourhood activist movements \nfavoured the final shutdown, while the Interest Group of City Airport Tempelhof (ICAT) success-\nfully held a referendum in favour of Tempelhof Airport remaining in operation. The poll was held \non April 27, 2008 and won the approval of the majority of voters, but failed to achieve the mini-\nmum quorum of 25% \u2018Yes\u2019 votes of the total electorate. Legal claims of airlines opposing Tegel\u2019s \nclosure have not been successful.  \n3.0 EMPIRICAL STRATEGY \nFollowing standard rent theory, spatial variation in the value of urban land, net of commuting \ncost, reflects productivity or utility differentials that drive bid rent functions of residents and \nfirms. In principle, access to airports may be expected to increase the productivity of firms by \nproviding fast access to other regions and national markets and reducing transaction, communica-\ntion and information costs. If accessibility to other regions\u2019 markets significantly impacts on the \neconomic performance of regions and cities, then city areas close to transportation nodes such as \nairports should particularly benefit from regional integration given that journeys to and from air-\nports are time-consuming. If productivity effects are significant we would, all other factors being \nequal, expect increasing bids and equilibrium land prices in closer proximity to airports. Within \nair corridors, however, the exposure to aircraft noise should exhibit an adverse effect on worker \nproductivity and therefore decrease bids and equilibrium prices, conditional on access to fight \nconnections and other factors. Similarly, households living closer to airports may experience an \nincrease in utility due to fast access to flight connections and travel opportunities and a decline in \nutility from the exposure to aircraft noise, which is a clear disamenity. The proximity effect of an \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  7 \n \nairport is a net-effect of both, which following conventional praxis in the real estate economics \nliterature can be identified in a hedonic regression analysis (Rosen, 1974).  \nOur empirical analyses are conducted for three distinct submarkets, a) one\/two family houses, \ntown houses and villas, b) multi-family houses and c) commercial properties. While submarkets \na) and b) serve as a basis for an evaluation of household utility, submarket c) analogically yields \ninsights into productivity effects. Distinguishing the residential market into submarket a) and b) \npotentially yields further interesting insights, given the very distinct tenure structure. Sub-market \na) is closest to the vast majority of the existing literature on the impact of air-craft noise, which \nhas focused on owner occupied detached housing. A particularly interesting characteristic of the \nmulti-family housing market in Berlin (submarket b) is the very low rate of owner occupancy. \nAlthough we cannot observe the rate of owner occupancy directly, comparison of submarkets a) \nand b) still allow for an evaluation of the impact of aircraft noise on a) an owner-occupied and b) \na rental market. The price of multi-family properties with rented units reflects the expected cash \nflow of discounted rent streams. Given the lower mobility cost for renters, we expect renters to be \nless risk averse with regards to the potential (dis)utility effect of aircraft noise, which they will \nusually be uncertain about before moving in. This could result in a lower marginal price effect of \naircraft noise within the residential market (b) compared to the owner-occupied market a). \nBesides distinguishing into three separate submarkets, we first separately focus on the impact \nareas of the three airports in order to increase homogeneity within the reduced study areas, which \nencompass very different submarkets and potentially exhibit heterogeneity in implicit prices of \nvarious housing and location characteristics. In the second step we pool the data across the entire \ncity area to estimate an average treatment effect for the noise exposure as well as airport accessi-\nbility effects. Last, we investigate how individual sources of noise are perceived in interaction, i.e. \nif the disamenity effect of aircraft noise increases or decreases in the presence of street noise.  \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  8 \n \nEmpirical specification \nWe employ a standard hedonic specification controlling for structural (S) as well as locational (L) \nand neighborhood (N) characteristics in order to estimate the conditional impact of access to air-\nports and aircraft noise on the log of price per square meter of land (P). Given that the airport \nproximity effect potentially is a net-effect of accessibility and noise, failure of controlling for ei-\nther of the two effects may lead to biased coefficients.  \n(1) log\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0003 = \u2211 \u0005\u0003\u0006\u0001\u0003\u0003 + \u2211 \u0007\u0004\b\u0001\u0004\u0004 + \u2211 \t\u0005\n\u0001\u0005\u0005 + \u2211 \u000b\u0002\f\r\u0006\u000e\u0001\u0002 \u00d7 \u000f\u0002\u0002  \n+\u0010\u0011\r\r\u0001\u0006\u0012 + \u0013(\r\n\u0001\u0006) + \u000f\u0002 + \u0014\u0001\u0002  \n, where \u000f\u0002 is a full set of year fixed effects and \u0014\u0001\u0002 is an error term. All other Greek letters are \nparameters. EAST is a dummy denoting all transactions within the eastern part of the formerly \nseparated city. This specification is set up to detect localized externalities at an intra-city scale as \nthis article contributes to the discussion of the optimal location of airports within a city or region. \nAll factors that impact on the study area as whole are captured by time effects \u000f\u0002.In order to cap-\nture the gradual reduction in the price differential between both city parts (Ahlfeldt, 2010b) the \nEAST dummy is interacted with a set of year dummies. Hedonic controls include a conventional \nset of structural characteristics as well as broad and established sets of neighborhood attributes \nand environmental (dis)amenities (Ahlfeldt, 2010a) . Table A1 in the appendix provides a descrip-\ntion of variables used in the hedonic models. AA is an indicator of airport accessibility to airport j. \nAs a default we use road distance measures to terminals (DA) of all airports.  \n(2) \u0010(\r\r\u0001\u0006) = \u2211 \u0015\u0006\u0016\r\u0001\u0006\u0006  \nAt city-wide scale we also use an alternative airport accessibility indicator. Instead of estimating \nthe marginal price effects for all three airports individually, we estimate the marginal price effect \nfor the average distance to airport terminals (ADA), weighted by airports\u2019 proportions at overall \nair traffic (nj\/N). While being slightly more restrictive, this functional specification still accounts \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  9 \n \nfor the size of the airports in the study areas and correspondingly heterogeneous effects while at \nthe same time reducing the sensitivity to correlations of airport distances with unobserved neigh-\nborhood or location characteristics. \n(3) \u0010(\r\r\u0001\u0006) = \r\u0016\r\u0001 = \u0015 \u2211 \u0007\u0001\b \u0016\r\u0001\u0006\u0006  \nGiven the non-linear log scale of the decibel scale and the unknown subjective perception of \nnoise, we estimate the unknown non-linear relation between aircraft noise level and the (log) of \nland price per square meter g(AN) rather than assuming a log-linear functional form ex-ante. We \nmake use of dummy variables denoting 5 db grid cells (e.g. 50-55) and employ difference based \nsemi-parametric estimation techniques (Lokshin, 2006). Informed by non-parametric estimates, \nthe true functional relationship can then be approximated by an appropriate parametric specifica-\ntion.  \nNote that the vector \u03a3Ll in specification (1) includes street noise as the most important alternative \nsource of noise, so that specification (1) yields and estimate of aircraft noise effects, conditional \non the effect of street noise. Specification (1), however, treats both sources of noise as independ-\nent, which not necessarily has to be true. Let\u00b4s assume that household utility (U) is a function of \nboth air noise (A) and street noise (R) and other factors (Z) that are independent from both: \n\u0017 = \u210e(\r,\u0018,\u0019). Clearly, we expect that \u001a\u0017 \u001a\r\u001b < 0 and \u001a\u0017 \u001a\u0018\u001b < 0. If A and R are not independ-\nent, it follows that \u001a\u0017\u2032 \u001a\r\u001b \u2276 0 and \u001a\u0017\u2032 \u001a\u0018\u001b \u2276 0. In principle, second-order derivatives may \nbe negative, if both sources of noise are perceived to amplify each other, or positive, if the mar-\nginal utility effect of one source of noise becomes smaller in the presence of another. This ration-\nale applies analogically to marginal productivity effect. As a result, the marginal effect on prop-\nerty prices for each of the noise sources may depend on the presence of the alternative noise \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  10 \n \nsource. The hypothesis of a dependency among the two sources of noise can be tested empirically \nby introducing an interactive term of air noise (AN) and street noise (SN) into specification (1).  \n(4) log\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0003 = \u2211 \u0005\u0003\u0006\u0001\u0003\u0003 + \u2211 \u0007\u0004\b\u0001\u0004\u0004 + \u2211 \t\u0005\n\u0001\u0005\u0005 + \u2211 \u000b\u0002\f\r\u0006\u000e\u0001\u0002 \u00d7 \u000f\u0002\u0002  \n+\u0010(\r\r\u0001\u0006) + \u0013\u0011\r\n\u0001\u0006\u0012 + \u001c \r\n\u0001 \u00d7 \u0006\n\u0001 + \u000f\u0002 + \u0014\u0001\u0002  \nParameter \u001c then gives the change in marginal utility (productivity) effect as the level of alterna-\ntive noise increases by 1 db. If one of the two noise sources is perceived as dominating, so that the \npresence of an alternative source of noise adds less to the perceived disutility (disproductivity) of \nresidents (workers), \u001c will be positive.  \nIn line with the common strategy in applied urban economics research we control for various lo-\ncation attributes by a distance to the nearest feature measures (e.g. distance to the nearest green \nspace, rail station, etc.). The implicit assumption underlying the inclusion of these variables is that \nthe value of these features, discounted by distance, is traded against the land price. Similarly, \nbuilding on the traditional framework of rent theory, hedonic studies typically control for the dis-\ntance to the central business district (CBD). As Berlin exhibits a highly polycentric structure, with \ntwo dominating business areas, we include the minimum distance to the western (Breitscheid-\nplatz) or the eastern CBD (metro station \u201cStadtmitte\u201d) in our specifications.1 Moreover, we calcu-\nlate an employment potentiality as a detailed labour market accessibility indicator following Ahl-\nfeldt (2010a). Transaction i receives the employment potentiality of the precincts v it falls within \n(EPiv) , which is the aggregate of employment within all 1201 precincts in Berlin and 206 sur-\n                                                 \n1\n This specification implicitly treats both centres as perfect substitutes, which is in line with the definition of the \nSenate Department (Senatsverwaltung f\u00fcr Wirtschaft Arbeit und Frauen, 2004). This specification also avoids col-\nlinearity problems compared to the alternative of introducing distances to both CBD individually. \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  11 \n \nrounding municipalities within a 50 km buffer zone from the city\u00b4s outboundaries, weighted by \n(car) travel time (ttvw).2 \n(5) \f\u0002\u0001\t = \u2211 \f\nexp (\u2212\u001d\u001e\u001e\t\n)\n  \nAnalogically we calculate a green and water potentiality as the distance weighted sum of sur-\nrounding water or green areas to better capture the endowment with natural amenities. This is \nparticularly important in this analysis since Tegel Airport lies within a major recreational area and \nour objective is to estimate the impact of the adverse environmental quality due to noise emis-\nsions net of the utility derived from these amenities. Green (GP) and water (WP) potentialities are \ncalculated as the distance-weighted sum of the surface area for green and water spaces, respec-\ntively, at the level of 15,937 statistical blocks, which are connected by a straight-line distance \nmatrix (in km). To reflect car (employment) and walking (green and water) speed we employ spa-\ntial discount parameters of 0.1 (car) and 2 (green and water) following Ahlfeldt(2010a)and \nAhlfeldt (2009) and Ahlfeldt & Maennig(2010) respectively.3 All potentialities enter the empirical \nspecifications in logarithms so that coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities. Besides the po-\ntentiality variables another variable is worth mentioning, which is less common in the applied \nurban and real estate economics literature: the number of designated landmarks within 600 m, a \nthreshold based on Ahlfeldt & Maennig (2010). This variable accounts for the historic quality of \nthe neighbourhood, which is receiving increasing attention in the literature.4 \n                                                 \n2\n The internal distance for precinct i is calculated on the basis of its surface area (areai) (seeKeeble, \nOwens, & Thompson, 1982).See Ahlfeldt(2010a). \n3The car discount parameter (0.1) is based on a gravity type urban labour market accessibility model for the metropo-\nlitain area for Berlin. The walking (2) discount parameter was set to yield and exponential cost functionthat con-\nverges towards zero at a maximum walking distance of 2 km. \n4\n See Coulson & Lahr (2005) and Ahlfeldt & Maennig (2010) for recentexamples for the U.S. and Europe. \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  12 \n \nNote that with relatively few exceptions, we find a systematic spatial structure in the error term, \nwhich is typical for micro level spatial analyses. We use spatial autoregressive (SAR) models to \nobtain unbiased and efficient estimates in the presence of spatial dependency. LM tests in most of \nthese cases reject a spatial-lag model in favor of an error-corrections model. \n(6) \u0014 = \u001f \u0014 + ! \nwhere W is a binary row standardized weights matrix indicating transactions that are neighbours, \n\u001f is a parameter and ! is a random error term.5 In few cases, however, a weak autoregressive \nstructure seems to be resent in the price generating process so that a spatial-lag model is employed \nas a robustness check.  \n(7) \" = # \" + \u0019$ + ! \nwhere y is our endogenous variable, Z is a vector of variables included in specification (1), a is the \nrespective coefficient vector and # the lag parameter. Note that in spatial lag-models, coefficients \nneed to be adjusted before the usual interpretation applies. It can be shown that using a row stan-\ndardized spatial weights matrix, the appropriate \u201cspatial\u201d multiplier for the estimated coefficients \nis 1\/(1-#)  (see e.g. Won Kim, Phipps, & Anselin, 2003). Spatial error-correction models as well \nas spatial lag-models are estimated using maximum likelihood techniques.  \nData \nIn the present analysis we make use of an exhaustive record of 32,763 transactions of developed \nproperties that took place between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2007 within the boundaries \n                                                 \n5\n Wedefine transactions as neighbors if they occur within a 500 m radius. In very few cases where not transaction \noccured within the threshold, we define the nearest transaction as neighbor. The specification generally produces-\nsimilar resuls to an alternative weights matrix with inverse distance weights. We prefer the binary weights matrix \nsince inverse distance weights in some of our models with a limited geographic scope and few observations tend to \nproduce a strong spatial smooth.   \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  13 \n \nof the Federal State of Berlin, Germany.6 This study period stops almost 17 month before April \n27, 2008, when the referendum confirmed that Tempelhof would be closed. Our data set is a \ncomplete record, covering transactions for commercial (1,474) and residential properties (31,289), \nwhich following rent theory facilitate the evaluation of the impact of accessibility and environ-\nmental quality on the productivity of land (commercial land) as well as on household utility and \nlocation desirability (residential land). Throughout our empirical analyses, we distinguish residen-\ntial transactions into transactions of properties of a) on\/two-family houses, townhouses and villas \n(15,199 observations) and b) multi-family houses (14,998 observations).  \nThe transaction data provided by the Committee of Valuation Experts in Berlin (2008) includes \nthe usual parameters such as age, floor space, plot area, storeys as well as information on land \nuse, physical conditionand building type. Employing a GIS-environment, property transactions \nwere geo-referenced based on geographic coordinates and merged with the framework of the Ur-\nban and Environmental Information System of the Senate Department of Berlin (Senatsverwal-\ntung f\u00fcr Stadtentwicklung Berlin, 2006). Within this GIS-environment, additional environmental \ncontrol variables capturing the impact of natural and environmental amenities, transport and pub-\nlic infrastructure and built heritage, as well as noise emissions and airport accessibility variables \ncould be generated. All distances are precise at least at a 6 digit level and accurate to the level of \naddresses when referring to transactions. When referring to precincts or blocks, distances strictly \nrefer to their geographic centroids. Within the GIS-environment, neighborhood data are merged \nthat were available for 15,937 statistical blocks (population by age and origin, all referring to \n2005, and employment at workplace, referring to 2003), 338 traffic cells (rate of unemployment, \n                                                 \n6\n Onlyrelatively few observations had to beexcludedfrom the full record due to missing values in crucial characteris-\nticss. No signs for a sample selection bias were found.  \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  14 \n \nreferring to 2005) or 191 zip codes (purchasing power, referring to 2008).7 With the exception of \npurchasing power, which was bought from the market research organization GfK, these data were \nprovided by the State Statistical Institute Berlin-Brandenburg. \nThe primary variables of interest used to assess the external effects are indicators of access to the \nflight connections offered by the three (city) airports as well as the exposure to aircraft noise with-\nin the affected neighborhoods. Access to the airports is measured by the effective road distance \nfrom every individual transaction to the terminal buildings of the three airports. A distance matrix \nis created on the basis of the full Berlin road map built-in in MS Mappoint 2009. From an official \nreport (Laermkartierung nach Umgebungsrichtline, 09.07.2007),data on exposure to street noise \nand aircraft noise for Tegel Airport were available at a very detailed level of 10x10m grid cells. \nThe noise map for Tegel Airport covers approximately the northern half of the city, including the \nair corridors. Within this area, noise levels are recorded for all developed properties and expressed \nin an equivalent long-term sound pressure index (Lden) in the standard log decibel-scale (dB). \nThese official records refer to the effective sound pressure at facades and take into account all \nphysical obstacles that potentially affect noise patterns. \nOfficially, local authorities are required to determine noise protection zones where land use activi-\nties are restricted for all airports. For Tempelhof, however, the noise protection zone defined on \nthe basis of an equivalent long-term sound pressure level of more than 67 dB(A) zone hardly ex-\nceeds the territory of the airport and is therefore of little use in the present analysis. The best \navailable data that could be obtained were from the Berlin airports operating company \n(Flughafengesellschaft) in form of an electronic map for which sound pressure levels ranging \nfrom 50-55, 55-60, 60-65, 65-67 and more than 67 dB(A) are defined. Based on these discrete \n                                                 \n7\n Data on employment at workplace include all employees contributing to social insurances. \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  15 \n \ninformation, we employ a simple regression based interpolation approach in order to generated a \ndetailed continuous noise surface that is compatible with the official information for Tegel airport. \nTherefore, in the first step we define an auxiliary 100 m\u00d7100m grid and a new coordinate system \nwith an origin in the airfield centroid and the x-axis running parallel to the air corridor. Moreover, \nwe define a 350m buffer around the outmost zone where we assume a noise pressure of 45\u201350dB. \nIn the next step, a naive average of noise pressure (e.g. 52.5 for the 50-55 zone) as well x- and y- \ncoordinates within the auxiliary coordinate system are assigned to the newly generated grid \npoints(g). A  regression of average noise pressure (NL) on third order polynomial vectors of x- (X \n= x+x\u00b2+x\u00b3) and y- (Y=+y+y\u00b2+y\u00b3) coordinates (suppressing negative signs), interactions of both \n(X x Y=xy+(xy)\u00b2+(yx)\u00b3) and a full set of interactive terms with dummies denoting the northern (N) \nand the western (W) quadrants of the coordinate system yields predicted values of noise exposure \nfor about 10,000 gird points (g) in the area.   \n(8) \n\b\u000b = % &'\u000b&$\f + &(\u000b&$\r + &'\u000b \u00d7 (\u000b&$\u000e+&\n\u000b \u00d7 '\u000b&)\f + &\n\u000b \u00d7 (\u000b&)\r + &\n\u000b \u00d7 '\u000b \u00d7 (\u000b&)\u000e\n+& \u000b \u00d7 '\u000b&*\f + & \u000b \u00d7 (\u000b&*\r + & \u000b \u00d7 '\u000b \u00d7 (\u000b&*\u000e+ +\u03c9\u000f  \n, where lower case letters form the set of parameters and \u03c9 is an error term. Based on the esti-\nmated parameter vectors \u0001$\f, \u2212 *\u000e- \u0003the level of noise exposure can be predicted for the about \n10,000 grid points (g) in the area. \nNaturally, this approach is better suited for producing reliable interpolations rather than extrapola-\ntions, so that we only keep grid points with a predicted value larger than 45dB. Overall, the pro-\ncedure yields a reasonable fit as suggested by a R2 of 81.5 and a close fit of obtained and imputed \nnoise level along the zone boundaries (see Figure2). One limitation of this approach is that physi-\ncal obstacles within a pre-defined noise-zone are not taken into account by the interpolated val-\nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  16 \n \nues. We note, however, that there are no evident obstacles, e.g. high-rise buildings, elevated roads \nor railways, evident for the noise impact area. \n[Figure 2 about here] \nFor Schoenefeld airport, noise information is even more restricted. As the airport lies outside the \nboundaries of Berlin, with only a relatively small part of the air corridor crossing Berlin territory, \nno detailed noise maps were included into the noise report. The only available information there-\nfore is a map of the area of restricted development, which, however, already takes into account \nthat noise levels will increase considerably when the new international airport BBI will be inaugu-\nrated. Based on this zone of restricted development we further define a 3 km buffer zone. Fig-\nure3shows the study area and the areas exposed to considerable aircraft noise. Evidently, the noise \nemissions follow the extensions of runways, which run parallel in east-west direction in each case. \nNote that for Tegel airport the available noise data covers a much larger area, but we restrict the \nvisualization to the area where noise exposure exceeds a threshold of 45 dB so that the scale is \ncompatible with Tempelhof. We make use of the GIS-environment to assign transactions to noise \nlevels and zones displayed in Figure 3. \n[Figure 3 about here] \n4.0 EMPIRICAL RESULTS \nAirport impact areas: Residential \nAs discussed, Tegel Airport during the study period was the most important airport within the \nregion and by far the most important of the two city airports. We start our empirical analyses for \nthe residential submarkets a) and b) within the TXL impact area where aircraft noise exceeds a \n40 dB level. Below this threshold, aircraft noise should hardly play an important role within an \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  17 \n \nurban environment where the usual alternative noise sources are present. Table 1 presents a series \nof estimations following equation (1) that permit inference on the disutility effects of aircraft \nnoise.  \nColumn (1) shows results for a set of mutually exclusive 5-dB grid cell dummies for submarket \na), starting at a 45-50 dB noise level. Coefficients on the grid cell dummies give the average price \ndifferential within the respective zones relative to the base zone with a noise level of 40-45 dB. \nResults indicate non-significant price effects up to a level of 50-55 dB and negative and signifi-\ncant price discounts at higher noise levels. While properties within the 55-60 dB zone sell at mod-\nerate discounts of about 7% compared to otherwise comparable properties, properties that are ex-\nposed to an equivalent sound pressure of more than 70 dB sell at discounts of more than 40%.8 \nFor an average property in our sample this implies an absolute reduction in sales price of close to \n\u20ac88,000.9 These results are in line with a large negative impact on household utility and indicate a \nnon-linear impact with a discontinuity around 55 dB. Price differentials remain virtually un-\nchanged if estimated conditional on airport accessibility, measured as the road distance to the \nTXL terminal (column 2).  \nThese results stand in sharp contrast to the corresponding findings for submarket b shown in col-\numn (3). While, as discussed, a smaller discount might be expected for submarket b) and renter \noccupied multi-family houses, the entire absence of significant effects is certainly surprising. For \nnone of the noise zones, however, are there significant price differentials observable. Not even are \nthere negative coefficients that systematically increase in magnitude at higher noise levels. Again, \n                                                 \n8\n The percentage impact (PI) is approximated from the coefficient b according to the standard interpretation for \ndummy variables in semi-log models : PI = (exp(b)-1)\u00d7100 (Halvorsen&Palmquist, 1980). \n9\n From the percentage impact (PI) the average absolute impact (AI) is derived according to following formula : \nAI = PI\/(1-PI)\u00d7P\u00d7S, where P and S are the mean sales price and lot size of properties.  \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  18 \n \nresults hardly change if noise effects are estimated conditional on access to the airport (column 4). \nNote that correcting for a spatial structure in the error terms detected in models (3) and (4) hardly \naffects the results for either market (columns 5 and 6). Figure 4 shows the results of a semi-\nparametric regression of the noise treatment (conditional on structure, location, neighbourhood \nand airport access). We plot the conditional mean in transaction prices at different noise level \nrelative to the area average of the 40\u201345-dB base zone (in log differences). The results pretty \nmuch confirms Table 1 findings. While for submarket b) price differentials hardly deviate form \nzero for all noise levels, for submarket a) prices continuously decline with in noise levels beyond \n50 dB and become negative beyond 55dB. At the same time, the marginal impact increases with \nnoise level, supporting the notion of a non-linear effect of aircraft noise on household utility.  \nTable2 presents the results for a similar set of estimates for the impact area of Tempelhof airport. \nSince our generated noise data does not cover noise levels below 45 dB, we define a 500-\nm  buffer distance to the 45 dB area as base zone. Due to the much smaller size of the airport, the \nnoise level, even for properties within the air corridor and very close to the airport, hardly exceeds \na level of 60 dB. Overall, the pattern of results resembles the findings for the Tegel Airport im-\npact area, although even for the dummy variables denoting the areas with the highest noise level, \nthere are no coefficients that are negative and significant. The large and negative, albeit not sig-\nnificant, price differential for the 60+ dB zone, however, is nonetheless remarkable. It implies a \nnegative price differential of about 27% compared to the control zone and even more compared to \nareas with lower noise levels. In terms of magnitude this price differential even exceeds the one \nfor similar noise levels within the Tegel Airport neighbourhood. For an average property within \nthe 60+ zone the relative discount implies an absolute discount of about \u20ac84000, which, despite \nthe lower noise level, is close to the maximum noise effect in proximity to Tegel Airport. In con-\ntrast, similar to the case of TXL, there is hardly evidence for a negative noise effect on submar-\nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  19 \n \nket b). Again, conditioning on airport access (columns 2 and 4) as well as accounting for spatial \ndependency (columns 5 and 6) hardy affects the pattern of results, which also becomes evident in \nthe semi-parametric estimates in Figure 5. Prices for multi-family houses (b) even tend to increase \nwhen moving into areas with higher noise level. While properties in submarket a) similarly ex-\nhibit conditional mean prices that increase in noise at lower levels, there is a sharp discontinuity at \napproximately55dB, after which the relationship is reversed.  \nAs discussed, for Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, detailed noise records are not available. The best informa-\ntion we have is the zone of restricted development. In order to assess whether properties within \nthis zone sell at a significant discount due to noise emissions, we run a set of Table 1 and 2 type \nregressions using a dummy for the zone of restricted development and a study area within a 3 km \nbuffer surrounding this zone. Results in Table 3, again, reveal a relatively clear pattern of results. \nThere is a significant price discount for submarket a) properties of about 27%, pointing to consid-\nerable disutility effect. For an average property within the zone this implies a considerable dis-\ncount of about \u20ac70,000. Although generally within the same range, this is a slightly lower magni-\ntude compared to the maximum noise effects found for Tegel and Tempelhof airport. At the same \ntime no significant discounts are found for submarket b). These findings are robust to controlling \nfor airport accessibility and spatial dependency, which following the LM-test scores is addressed \nby spatial-lag models (5). Note that no spatial dependency is evident in the column (4) estimates \nand that the column (6) results are provided as a robustness check only. \nAirport impact areas: Commercial \nAs discussed in Section 2, we expect aircraft noise not only to have an adverse effect on house-\nhold utility, but also on productivity of workers and employees and, consequently, the value of \ncommercial land. Our record of property transactions covers commercial properties within the \nnoise impact area of Tegel and Tempelhof airport. Analogically to Tables 1\u20133 for the residential \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  20 \n \nsubmarkets, Table 4 presents estimated average price differentials within different zones of noise \nexposure for the commercial property market for the Tegel (columns 1-3) and Tempelhof (col-\numns 4-6) impact areas. Again, taking the 40-45 dB noise zone as a basis, coefficients in column \n(1), similarly to the results for the owner-occupied residential submarket a), indicate negative \nprice differentials for the 55\u201360dB zone. At higher noise levels, however, no significant effects \nare found. Once airport accessibility is accounted for (column 2), however, all coefficients be-\ncome negative and considerably increase in magnitude. At the same time, the negative and sig-\nnificant coefficient on road distance to the airport in column (2) points to significant proximity \nbenefits. Moreover, noise effects for the65-70 dB zone is large and negative (price discounts up to \n85%), conditional on airport accessibility. Apparently, the negative productivity effects related to \nnoise are compensated by productivity gains from quick access to the wide array of flight connec-\ntions offered by the city\u2019s most important business airport. These results indicate that estimated \naircraft noise effects can be biased if accessibility effects are not controlled for. More generally, \nthey highlight the importance of disentangling positive and negative externalities emanated by \ntransport infrastructure as shown by Ahlfeldt (2010a)  for main roads and urban rail stations. Al-\nthough negative and large, the coefficient for the 60\u201365-dB is not significant and of smaller mag-\nnitude than for the 55\u201360-dB zone, which seems somewhat anomalous. Closer inspection of the \ndata reveals that this effect is most likely attributable to relatively high prices for commercial \nproperties within a medium-size retail center at Residenzstrasse. Correction for spatial depend-\nency (3) leaves the results largely unchanged. At first glance, the coefficient seems to be much \nlower for the 65\u201370dB zone. The decrease, however, is partially attributable to application of a \nlag-model, for which coefficients need to be corrected, as described in Section 2 (coefficient Rho \ntakes a value of 0.36). In any case, the coefficient for the 60\u201365-dB noise zone is not significant \nin the lag-model. \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  21 \n \nEstimated noise effects on commercial properties are similar within the Tempelhof Airport impact \narea. There is a large, negative and highly statistically significant discount of about 75% within \nthe 55\u201360-dB zone in addition to a smaller effect for the 50\u201355-dB zone (columns 1\u20133). Esti-\nmated noise effects are hardly affected by controlling for airport accessibility (2) and spatial de-\npendency (3). The notable difference is that negative noise effects seem to be compensated by \npositive accessibility effects in the case of Tegel, but not Tempelholf, which is plausible in light \nof the relatively small number of flight connections offered by Tempehlhof airport.  \nOverall, these results strongly indicate the presence of localized positive and, in particular, nega-\ntive productivity effects of (city) airports. Although positive effects seem to be limited to airports \noffering a large array of flight connections), these effects can be large enough to partially com-\npensate for the negative effect of noise. Our results further suggest a discontinuity in the produc-\ntivity effect of aircraft noise around 50\u201355dB, which is even more apparent than in the disutility \neffects for households. A (conditional) discount of about 75% within the area exposed to heavy \naircraft noise indicates a considerable reduction in worker efficiency, making respective proper-\nties much less desirable for commercial purposes. \nCity-wide effects  \nThe results presented so far consistently point to adverse productivity and utility effects related to \nexposure to aircraft noise within all airport impact areas, as well as a potential discontinuity in the \nnoise perception at a threshold of about 55 dB. Only for submarket b, comprising renter-occupied \nmulti-family houses, could a negative effect not been found. In the remainder of the article, we \npool our data separately for each submarket across the whole city area in order to estimate the \naverage treatment effects for aircraft noise and airport accessibility. While calibrating the hedonic \nmodels based to the full data-base allows us to exploit all available price variation and to achieve \npotentially higher parameter stability, the pooled models may be slightly less efficient in predict-\nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  22 \n \ning hedonic prices within the airport impact areas as marginal prices for selected attributes may \nslightly vary across space.  \nWe start with submarket a), the 1- and two-family houses, and repeat column (1) estimates form \nTables 1 and 2 for the whole city area. Results presented in Table 5, column (1) are in line with \nthe finding for the TXL and THF impact areas. There is a negative and statistically significant \ndiscount beyond 55 dB. The maximum percentage discount of about 47% is within the same \nrange as in Table 1, even slightly larger. In column (2), we extend the specification by individual \nroad distance to airport measures for all airports (see Equation 2) to account for airport accessibil-\nity. While there is a negative and significant impact for distance to TXL and THL, which is in line \nwith a positive utility effect from access to flight connections, the opposite is true for SXF. Esti-\nmated noise effects remain virtually unaffected as they are in column (3) where neighbourhood \neffects corresponding to the airport impact areas used in the previous section are included to con-\ntrol for unobserved neighbourhood particularities. In column (4), finally, we replace individual \naccessibility variables by the (weighted) average distance to airport (AVA) measure defined in \nequation (3). This is our preferred accessibility treatment due to presumably lower correlations \nwith unobserved characteristics of the airport neighbourhoods. We find a positive effect for prox-\nimity to flight connections, with property prices decreasing by about 2.2% per 1 km increase in \naverage distance to airports.  \nTable 6 repeats column 5 estimates for submarket b), the renter occupied multi-family houses. In \nline with the previous findings for the individual airport impact areas, there are no significant \nnoise discounts (columns 1-4). Individual airport accessibility effects are inconsistent (2-3) and \nthe average distance to airport treatment effect insignificant (4). Similarly, no compelling accessi-\nbility effects are revealed for commercial properties in Table 7. Results for the productivity ef-\nfects of aircraft noise are more ambiguous. For the zone of highest noise exposure (65-70 dB) \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  23 \n \nthere is a large and significant discount of about 50% in our preferred column (4) model, which is \nin line with previous findings. Contrary to Table 4 results for the TXL and THF impact areas, \nthere is no adverse effect for the 55-60 dB zone in all models. Moreover, the problem with the \nmedium size retail center at \u201cResidenzstrasse\u201d within the 60-65 dB noise zone of TXL airport, is \nconsiderably aggravated. The large and positive coefficient indicates that the pooled model is less \ncapable to explain the relatively high prices for commercial properties in the center. The SAR \nmodel, for which results are presented in column (5), to some degree \u201ccures\u201d these inconsisten-\ncies. After correcting for the spatial structure in the error term, we find a large and significant \ndiscount of about 47% within the 55-60 dB zone, which, however, is still considerably less than \nsuggested by Table 4 results. In line with the SAR model in Table 4, column (3), we find negative \nand relatively large, but not significant coefficients for the higher noise zones (60-65 and 65-\n70 dB).  \nNote that we don\u00b4t estimate SAR models for submarkets a) and b) at city-wide scale due to the \nlarge sample sizes. Spatial LM test scores presented in Table 5 and 6 notes strongly indicate the \nappropriateness of spatial error correction models. In contrast to lag-models, error-correction \nmodels leave OLS coefficients unbiased if the underlying models are appropriately specified. \nGiven the consistency of OLS and SAR coefficient estimates for both submarkets in Tables 1 and \n2, there is reason to believe that potential problems of spatial dependency are limited to inefficient \nstandard errors at the city-wide level, too. Since for both submarkets noise effects are generally \nestimated at very high levels of statistical significance, we believe that qualitative and quantitative \ninterpretations of OLS coefficients are justified.  \nMarginal price effects and treatment heterogeneity \nIn the last step of our empirical analyses we turn our attention to the marginal price effect of air-\ncraft noise. Average treatment estimates at the city-level basically confirm previous findings from \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  24 \n \nthe narrower samples indicating negative and significant effects for submarkets a) and c). Noise \neffects become crucial beyond a threshold level of about 55 dB. This non-linearity needs to be \ntaken into account when defining a parametric specification with the objective of revealing mar-\nginal noise effects. As a somewhat pathological result, we consistently find no effects for submar-\nket b). Although at a city wide level airport accessibility does not seem to be a very critical de-\nterminant for household utility or firm productivity, the neighbourhood analysis of Tegel Airport \nshows that estimated aircraft noise effects may be considerably biased if airport accessibility is \nnot accounted for. In addition, there is another important source of bias that has not been ad-\ndressed in the previous steps and has often been overlooked in the literature: The interaction with \nalternative noise sources, in our case, street noise. As discussed in section 3, the marginal \n(dis)utility and (dis)productivity effects of aircraft noise may be expected to be larger if no alter-\nnative noise is present. Under this assumption, estimated aircraft noise effects will be biased if the \nspatial distribution of aircraft noise is correlated with street noise. In order to address this poten-\ntial interaction effect we estimate specification (4), which includes an interactive term of aircraft \nnoise and street noise.10 \nResults are presented in Table 8, starting with submarket a) and omitting the interaction effect in \ncolumn (1). Throughout Table 8 only the variables of interest are displayed to save space. Full \nestimation results including hedonic characteristics are presented in Table A2 in the appendix for \nselected models (3, 6, 9) that stand exemplarily for the three submarkets. If the interaction of \nstreet noise and air noise is not accounted for, we find a negative and significant (log-)linear im-\npact of both noise sources where, notably, street noise seems to have much greater (dis)utility \neffects than aircraft noise. While for an average 10 dB increase in street noise there is a price dis-\n                                                 \n10\n Our measure of street noise does not include sources of noise, especially not aircraft noise. \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  25 \n \ncount of about 5%, a respective increase in air noise yields only a relatively moderate 1% effect \n(column2). This relationship changes considerably once the interaction between the two noise \nsources is accounted for (column 2). There is a positive and significant coefficient on the noise \ninteractive term, revealing that the marginal price effect for one type of noise diminishes in the \npresence of another. Equivalently interesting, estimated individual noise effects increase consid-\nerably, in particular for air craft noise, whose impact is now within the same range as street noise. \nAn average 10 dB increase in air or street noise now yield price discounts of 5% and 7%. As dis-\ncussed, our previous findings indicate a discontinuity in the utility and productivity effect around \n55 dB. We therefore extend the model by a dummy variable indicating areas with 55 or more dB \nnoise level in order to test for a significant level shift, conditional on the log-linear average effect \nin column (3). Indeed, a significant discount of approximately 10% is evident for properties \nwithin that zone, while the marginal price effect of an average 10 dB increase is considerably re-\nduced to 2% and no longer statistically significant. The coefficient on the interactive term is \nslightly reduced and sharply fails the 10% significance criterion (p-value: 0.14).  \nIn column (4-6) we apply the same models as in (1-3) to subsample b). If the interaction between \nnoise sources is not accounted for we, similar to the previous results, find the \u201cpathological\u201d posi-\ntive noise effects for air noise and also for street noise (column 4). Once the interaction is consid-\nered, however, these effects are reversed (5). Individual noise effects are now negative, significant \nand within a similar range to the other residential submarket a). An average 10 dB increase in \nnoise level yields a 6% (3%) reduction in property prices in the case of air (street) noise. As in the \ncase of submarket a) the coefficient on the interactive term is positive and statistically significant, \nagain pointing to considerable treatment heterogeneity. Interestingly, there results even remain \nunchanged if a level-shift at the 55 dB level is allowed for, indicating that there is no discontinuity \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  26 \n \nat this threshold for this submarket. These findings are most notable as they highlight the potential \nof severe bias in estimated noise effects if interaction effects are not accounted for appropriately.  \nThe pattern of results for the commercial property market (submarket c) in columns (7-10) exhib-\nits some similarities. Without interactive term, estimated noise effects are small and insignificant \nfor street noise and positive and significant for air noise (column 7). With the interactive term \n(column 8), both coefficients on individual noise sources are negative and of roughly the same \nmagnitude as for the other submarkets, although not statistically significant at conventional levels. \nSimilarly, the interactive term exhibits a positive, but not significant coefficient. Previous results \nhad shown the strongest discontinuity for the commercial property prices, which is confirmed \nwhen we extend the present specification by the dummy for 55 or more dB (column 9). While the \nthree coefficients of interest considerably increase in magnitude and the coefficients on street \nnoise and the interactive term even become statistically significant, there is still a negative (condi-\ntional) price shift of about 40% once the 55 dB threshold is crossed. Submarket c) seems to be the \nonly submarket where spatial misspecifications give some cause for concern. We therefore repeat \ncolumn (9) estimates employing an SAR (error) model. Results do not change qualitatively. There \nis a negative and highly statistically significant discount for property exposed to 55 dB or more of \nnow about 44%, while individual noise effects are not estimated precisely taking as a basis con-\nventional criteria. These findings, nevertheless, confirm the presence of very strong adverse ef-\nfects on the productivity of office workers. We note that the slight instability of noise estimates \nfor the commercial property market might be partially caused by a relatively low number of ob-\nservations of traded commercial properties within areas exposed to high air noise levels, which, \nhowever, is in line with firms\u2019 aversion to aircraft noise.  \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  27 \n \n5.0 CONCLUSION \nThis paper contributes to the assessment of external effects of (city) airports by providing an in-\ndepth investigation of three airports in Berlin, Germany. While we find strong evidence of nega-\ntive productivity and utility effects reflected in significant property price discounts within areas \nthat are exposed to high levels of aircraft noise, evidence of positive accessibility effects is less \ncompelling. For residential properties, an average treatment effect of approximately 5\u20136% is evi-\ndent for every 10-dB increase in aircraft noise, which is within the range for results available in \nthe literature (Nelson, 2004). Moreover, for the submarket of one- and two-family houses, there is \nevidence of a significant discontinuity in the noise perception when a threshold of 55dB is \ncrossed. Within the zones of highest noise exposure, properties sell at discounts of more than \n40%, corresponding to \u20ac85,000 for an average property. For commercial properties, the disconti-\nnuity is even more pronounced. Conditional mean property prices decrease relatively abruptly by \napproximately 40% once the threshold is crossed, indicating a strong adverse effect on office \nworker productivity. Positive accessibility effects could only be found at the city level for one-and \ntwo family houses, where a 1-km increase in the weighted average distance to flight connections \nreduces prices by 2.2%, and for commercial properties within the narrower impact area of Tegel \nairport. \nOur results support the notion that airport externalities are composite effects of positive and nega-\ntive effects, so that failure to control for either of the effects can result in biased coefficients for \nthe other. Even more crucial, a significant interaction effect with alternative sources of noise is \nevident, which can lead to severe bias if not appropriately accounted for. Although there are non-\nsignificant or even positive noise effects for the submarket of multi-family houses, significant \nnegative effects within the usual range are evident once the interaction with street noise is ac-\ncounted for. Consistently for all submarkets, the positive interaction effect indicates that the mar-\nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  28 \n \nginal price effect of either street or aircraft noise decreases in the presence of an alternative noise \nsource. \nBased on our findings, it is possible to inform planners and authorities about productivity and \nutility effects of city airports, which are quite controversial in general and especially in the case of \nBerlin.Overall, our results provide little justification for location of airports within densely devel-\noped downtown areas. Although at the city level there is hardly any evidence of positive accessi-\nbility effects, such effects within the narrower impact area seem, if present at all, to be more than \ncompensated by adverse noise effects. As a result, the net effect is clearly dominated by adverse \nproductivity and utility effects, making a more remote airport location desirable from a welfare \neconomics point of view. More generally, our results confirm recent findings on limited produc-\ntivity effects of intra-city access to inter-city transport hubs (Ahlfeldt, 2010b), which is somewhat \nsurprising in light of the strong emphasis in economic geography on the benefits arising from \ngood access to regional and international markets.  \nExternal productivity and utility effects of city airports  29 \n \nLITERATURE \nAhlfeldt, G.
