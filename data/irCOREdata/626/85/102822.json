A. J. Amaratunga, V. S. Veerasamy, W. I. Milne, C. A. Davis,a) S. R. P. Silva, \nand H. S. MacKenzie \nDepartment of Engineering, Cambridge University, Trumpington Street, \nCambridge CBZ IPZ, United Kingdom \n(Received 21 January 1993; accepted for publication 15 May 1993) \nA photoconductive effect is observed in tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) or amorphous \ndiamond films with a high proportion of sp3 bonding and a structure analogous to amorphous \nsilicon. The spectral response is shown to peak at around 750400 nm and extend into the near \nUV region. The maximum photoresponse coincides wit.h the optical absorption edge. The \nquantum efficiency of 300 nm thick films with interdigitated electrodes is over 10% in the \nwavelength range 450400 nm. \nThere is presently great interest in hydrogen-free tet- \nrahedral amorphous carbon (WC) because of its high di- \namondlike sp3-bonded carbon content (70%~85%) com- \npared to other amorphous carbon films. This bonding gives \nta-C many valuable properties such as high mechanical \nhardness, low friction, and chemical inertness.\u2019 ta-C is also \na semiconductor with an optical band gap in the range of \n1.65-2.0 eV.\u2019 The coupling of optical absorption and space \ncharge limited current flow results have shown the density \nof states at the valence band edge to be of the order of 10\u201d \ncm- \u2019 eV-*, decreasing exponentially to lOi8 cm 3 eV ~ * at \n0.4 eV from the valence band edge.\u201d The ta-C films used in \nthis work were deposited using a cathodic vacuum arc and \nare optically smooth, pin hole free and can be grown over \nareas up to 10 cm2 at relatively low temperatures \n( < 60 \u201cC). The cathodic arc is a low voltage, high current \ndischarge in which the current is concentrated at one or \nmore micron-sized cathode spots.4 The extremely high cur- \nrent densities at the cathode spot cause rapid evaporation \nof the solid cathode material, most of which is ionized in \nan intense plasma associated with the cathode spots. In the \ncase of a carbon cathode (ultra-pure graphite), the emitted \nions are primarily C+ and C2+ ions.\u2019 The cathodic arc \nplasma stream is passed through a magnetic torus to filter \nout the macroparticles and neutrals. This ensures that only \ncarbon ions impinge on the substrate to form thin films of \nta-C. The substrate can be left at floating potential or if \nconducting can be biased negatively to increase the carbon \nion energies. Thin films of ta-C ranging from 100 to 300 \nnm in thickness were grown on LPCVD grown silicon \nnitride and fused quartz substrates under floating potential. \nUnder t.hese conditions, the average energy of the carbon \nions is equal to the energy with which they are emitted \nfrom the cathode, i.e., about 20 eV. A deposit.ion rate of \nabout 3 rim\/s was achieved with a nominal magnetic field \nstrength of 60 mT. The arc voltage and current were 20 V \nand 40 A, respectively, during deposition. Structural char- \nacterization of the films deposited under these conditions \nwas carried out using a transmission electron microscope \n(TEM) fitted with an electron energy loss spectroscopy \nattachment. Diffuse rings typical of amorphous materials \nwere observed in the diffraction patterns of the films. A \nplasmon peak of about 30 eV and an $-bonded carbon \ncontent of approximately 70% was measured.3 \nInterdigitated gap-cell struttures consisting of 100 nm \nthick, 5 mm long gold contacts with spacings of 50 \/Lrn \nwere patterned on the ta-C films using photolithography. A \nprogrammable voltage source was then connected to the \ngold contacts and the current passing through the ta-C film \nwas monitored using a Keithley picoammeter with a sen- \nsitivity of the order of 10 l3 A. All electrical measure- \nments were carried out in the plane of the films. The \ncurrent-voltage characteristics of the ta-C gap cells under \ndark and light conditions are shown in Fig. 1. An AM1 \nfiber optic light source was used for head-on illumination \nin both continuous and pulsed modes. Symmetrical 1-V \ncurves measured with change in voltage polarity confirmed \nthe ohmic nature of the contacts. The current increase of \none to two orders of magnitude when the structures were \nexposed to light corresponds to a decrease in the resistivity \nof ta-C films from lo7 to 10\u2019 lZ cm. This is attributed to a \nphotoconductive erect in ta-C films. \nThe spectral response of the ta-C thin films was mon- \nitored over the wavelength range 350-1050 nm.

Optical absorption coefficient for a ta-C film on quartz. \ncharacterized by focusing light in the 350-1050 nm wave- \nlength range. The source of radiation was a tungsten lamp \nin conjunction with a spectrometer with 800 line\/mm grat- \nings blazed at 1 pm intervals. The spectral resolution of the \nsystem was 5 nm. The responsivity and external quantum \nefficiency of the ta-C photoconductor was obtained by \ncomparison with a standard of known responsivity, a super \nUV series 7 photodiode. Satisfactory agreement was ob- \ntained between the average photodiode calibration curve \nprovided by the manufacturer and the responsivity calibra- \ntion on the specific diode done in our laboratory. The spec- \ntral response curves for films with thicknesses 100 and 300 \nnm are shown in Fig. 2. The incident light was chopped at \n100 Hz and the ac component of the photocurrent response \nwas measured using a lock-in amplifier. \nThe external quantum efficiency versus wavelength \ncurves for the two samples of different thicknesses are also \nshown on Fig. 2. The illuminated areas of the photocon- \nductor and the silicon diode used for calibration were kept \nconstant, equal to 8 mm2. Noteworthy features of the re- \nsponsivity versus wavelength curves are: \n(i) The responsivity curves for both samples show a \npronounced peak at about 700-800 nm, corresponding to \nphoton energies between 1.6 and 1.8 eV; \n(ii) the photoresponse extends into the blue-green re- \ngion of the spectrum; \n(iii) the quantum efficiency of the 300 nm thick ta-C \nfilms lies between 10% and 12.5% in the 450-800 nm \nwavelength range. The optical band gap of the ta-C depos- \nited on fused quartz is determined to be in the range of \n1.8-2.2 eV from the Taut plot of the transmission spec- \ntrum. The maximum photoresponse at 750-800 nm is \nfound to coincide with the absorption edge. The value of \nthe absorption coefficient a for the films is greater than lo4 \ncm- \u2019 from 750 to 400 nm, Fig. 3. \nThe current activation energy of the films was also \nmonitored in the dark and under white light. The dark \nconductivity as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. \n4. The dark conductivity cd increases with increasing tem- \nperature following the Mott-Twose relationship cd \n=o(O)exp( -E&W) suggesting activation of carriers \ninto the extended states. This gives an activation energy E, \nof 0.2-0.25 eV above the valence band, if one assumes that \nthe as-deposited ta-C is weakly p type.3 On the other hand, \nthe variation of conductivity under light was found to be \nindependent of temperature, curve (b) in Fig. 3. This re- \nsult is in accordance with conductivity under light aPh be- \ning dominated by the generation term in the expression \ncPh=od+pOGr, thus showing that the mobility lifetime \n(~~7) product is temperature independent (in the range \nconsidered) for a given bulk photogeneration rate G in \nta-C films. \n. \nIn the interpretation of the photoconductive results it \nis reasonable to assume that the photogenerated current is \npredominantly carried by electrons in the extended states \nof the conduction band. In this scheme electrons are ex- \ncited from the extended states in the valence band or from \nfilled localized tail states near the valence band edge. The \nspectral response of photoconductivity, therefore, reveals \ninformation regarding the electronic band gap (mobility \ngap) of this amorphous semiconductor since the mobility \ngap should be larger than the optical band gap.

On \nthe assumption of parabolic bands and the density of states \nbeing a linear function of energy,6*7 the expression \n(c&w)\u2018~\u2018= (hv--E,) leads to a value of 1.6-1.8 eV for the \noptical band gap E,, consistent with the responsivity data. \nHowever, if the density of states is taken to be a square- \nroot function of energy,\u201c*\u2019 the expression (ntr) \u201c\u2018\u201chv \n= B(kv- E,,) with u taken as the refractive index yields an \noptical band gap Ec between 2 and 2.2 eV for ta-C films, \nsimilar to that reported by Lossy et al. \u2018\u201d using the same \nprocedure. The photoconductivity results are, therefore, \nconsistent with the optical absorption data if the density of \nstates is taken to be a linear function of energy. \nIn summary, hydrogen-free ta-C films deposited from a \nfiltered vacuum arc source display photoconductivity.
