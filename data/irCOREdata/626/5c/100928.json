Be-\nsides the strong feeding of the 52Ca ground state, the only other sizeable cross section proceeds\nto a 3\u2212 level at 3.9 MeV. There is no measurable direct yield to the first excited 2+ state at 2.6\nMeV. The results illustrate the potential of such direct reactions for exploring cross-shell proton\nexcitations in neutron-rich nuclei and confirms the doubly-magic nature of 52Ca.\nFor decades, the cornerstone of nuclear structure has\nbeen the concept of single-particle motion in a well-\ndefined potential leading to shell structure and magic\nnumbers governed by the strength of the mean-field\nspin-orbit interaction [1]. Recent observations in exotic,\nneutron-rich nuclei have demonstrated that the sequence\nand energy spacing of single-particle orbits is not as im-\nmutable as once thought: some of the familiar magic\nnumbers disappear and new shell gaps develop [2]. Cross-\nshell excitations, arising from the promotion of nucleons\nacross shell gaps, probe changes in shell structure. They\nare, however, not always readily identifiable in nuclear\nspectra. This letter demonstrates that two-proton knock-\nout reactions can examine, selectively, cross-shell proton\nexcitations in neutron-rich systems.\nSingle-nucleon knockout reactions with fast radioac-\ntive beams are established tools to investigate the prop-\nerties of halo nuclei [3] and to study beyond mean-\nfield correlations, indicated by the quenching of spec-\ntroscopic strengths [4]. Eikonal theory [5] provides a\nsuitable framework for the extraction of quantitative nu-\nclear structure information from such reactions. In con-\ntrast, the potential of two-nucleon knockout as a spec-\ntroscopic tool has been recognized only recently. Bazin\net al. [6] have shown that two-proton removal reactions\nfrom beams of neutron-rich species at intermediate en-\nergies proceed as direct reactions and that partial cross\nsections to different final states of the residue provide\nstructure information. More recently, such a reaction\nwas used to infer the magicity of the very neutron-rich\n42Si nucleus [7].\nIn the current experiment, sizable cross sections for\nthe 9Be(54Ti,52Ca+\u03b3)X reaction were found to feed only\nthe 52Ca ground state and a 3\u2212 level with an excitation\nenergy near 4 MeV, bypassing completely the first 2+\nlevel at 2.6 MeV. These observations can be reproduced\nqualitatively by calculations which assign the 3\u2212 level to\nthe promotion of protons across the Z = 20 shell gap.\nIn addition, the data confirm the presence of a neutron\nsub-shell closure at N = 32, the subject of much recent\nattention [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].\nThe 54Ti secondary ions were produced by fragmen-\ntation of a 130 MeV\/nucleon 76Ge beam, delivered by\nthe Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National Super-\nconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, onto a 9Be fragmen-\ntation target. The ions were selected in the A1900 large-\nacceptance fragment separator [14], which was operated\nwith two settings during different phases of the exper-\niment; 1% momentum acceptance and no momentum\nrestriction, respectively. The secondary beam, with a\nmid-target energy of 72 MeV\/nucleon, interacted with\nanother, 375(4) mg\/cm2 thick, 9Be foil located at the\ntarget position of the high-resolution S800 spectrograph\n[15]. The knockout residues were identified event-by-\nevent from the time of flight between scintillators mon-\nitoring the beam, the energy loss measured in an ion-\nization chamber, and the position and angle informa-\ntion provided by the cathode-readout drift counters in\nthe S800 focal plane [15]. The 9Be reaction target was\nsurrounded by SeGA, an array of seventeen 32-fold seg-\nmented HPGe detectors [16], arranged in two rings (90\u25e6\nand 37\u25e6 with respect to the beam axis).\nAn inclusive cross section for two-proton knockout to\nall final states was derived from the yield of detected\n52Ca residues and the number of incoming 54Ti projec-\ntiles, taking into account the density of the secondary\n9Be target. To minimize effects arising from acceptance\nlimitations in the S800 spectrograph, only data with the\nmomentum acceptance of the A1900 fragment separator\nreduced to 1% were used to deduce the cross section.\n2Systematic uncertainties accounting for particle identifi-\ncation (6%), stability and purity of the beam (5%), and\nthe momentum acceptance of the spectrograph (4%) were\nadded to the statistical uncertainty in quadrature.\nFigure 1 presents the inclusive parallel-momentum dis-\ntribution for all two-proton knockout events from 54Ti to\n52Ca, together with that of the unreacted 54Ti projectiles\npassing through the target. As discussed below, \u223c 70%\nof the two-proton knockout cross section feeds the 52Ca\nground state directly, making it worthwhile to consider\nthese inclusive data first. The 52Ca momentum distri-\nbution of Fig. 1 is fairly narrow and centered close to\nthe beam velocity. As argued in Ref. [6], this observation\nis consistent with the reaction mechanism being direct\nin nature. The magnitude of the inclusive cross section,\n\u03c3inc = 0.32(4) mb, is of the same order as that reported\nin Ref. [7] for two-proton knockout to 42Si (0.12(3) mb).\nIt is also significantly smaller than that observed for the\n9Be(28Mg,26Ne) reaction [6], for example. To first order,\nthis indicates that the number of valence protons avail-\nable for the process must be small [6].\nFIG. 1: Longitudinal momentum distribution of the 52Ca\nknockout residues and the unreacted 54Ti projectiles (mo-\nmentum acceptance of the A1900 restricted to 1%). The\n52Ca data are compared to a calculated shape given by the\nconvolution of the separate distributions for two uncorrelated\nprotons removed from the f7\/2 orbit (dashed line) and to the\nsame curve, but folded with the momentum profile of the 54Ti\nbeam (solid line).\nTo proceed further in understanding the momentum\ndistribution, a description of 54Ti as a semi-magic nu-\ncleus, with a closedN = 32 neutron shell and two f7\/2 va-\nlence protons outside the Z = 20 core, has been adopted,\nin keeping with recent experimental information on the\nlevel structure and the B(E2; 0+ \u2192 2+1 ) transition rate\nof this nucleus [11, 13]. Following Ref. [6], the dashed\ncurve for 52Ca in Fig. 1 is the result of calculations where\nthe momentum distributions for the removal of two inde-\npendent, i.e. uncorrelated, f7\/2 protons have been con-\nvoluted. The solid line results when this distribution is\nfolded with the momentum profile of the unreacted 54Ti\nprojectiles, to account for the momentum spread in the\nincoming beam and the straggling in the target. The\nagreement is satisfactory, and the measured momentum\ndistribution consistent with the removal of two f7\/2 pro-\ntons being the dominant reaction process.\nThe \u03b3-ray spectrum measured in coincidence with the\n52Ca residues (Fig. 2) displays two transitions with en-\nergies of 1430(7) and 2562(13) keV. The latter can be\nidentified with the 2563(1) keV line reported by Huck\net al [10], the only prominent line seen in the \u03b2 decay of\n52K to 52Ca, and assigned by these authors as the 2+\u21920+\nground-state transition. The observation was confirmed\nin a more recent \u03b2-decay study [17]. At present, this\nsecond study is also the only one to report additional\ntransitions in 52Ca. In particular, a 3990 keV state was\nfound, with the second highest feeding in the \u03b2-decay\nprocess, and with deexcitation towards the 2+ level via\na 1427(1) keV transition. It is tempting to associate this\n\u03b3 ray with the 1430(7) keV line of Fig. 2. In the work\nof Ref. [17], the 3990 keV state was assigned Jpi = 3\u2212\nas the most likely quantum numbers based on the mea-\nsured feeding in the \u03b2-decay process, the feeding from\nanother level at 5951 keV, and the deexcitation pattern\ntowards the 2+ state. In addition, the excitation energy\nof the state at 3990 keV is close to that of the known\nfirst 3\u2212 excitation along the even-even Ca isotopic chain\nillustrated in Fig. 3.\n500 1500 2500 3500 4500\nEnergy (keV)\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n+0\n+2\n\u22123(     )\n=105(20)\u03b3I\n\u03b3I =100(25)\nCo\nun\nts \n\/ 1\n6 \nke\nV\n2562(12) keV\n1430(7) keV\n.\n52 Ca 3220\n67(7)%\n33(6)%\n3992(14) keV\n2562(12) keV\nFIG. 2: \u03b3-ray spectrum (2.75% detection efficiency at 1 MeV)\nin coincidence with the 52Ca knockout residues.

For this part of the ex-\nperiment, the A1900 fragment separator was operated with-\nout momentum restriction.\nThere is no appreciable direct feeding of the 2+ level\nin the two-proton knockout process as the 1430(7) and\n2562(13) keV lines are measured to have the same rela-\ntive intensity (see Fig. 2). As is discussed below, this 2+\nstate is understood as a neutron particle-hole excitation\nacross the N = 32 shell gap, involving the p3\/2 and p1\/2\norbitals. A priori, such an excitation is not expected to\nbe populated appreciably in the reaction of a 54Ti pro-\n30\n1157\n3308\n0\n1346\n3614\n0\n3832\n4507\n0\n1027\n3997\n0\n2562\n3992\n44Ca 46Ca 48Ca 50Ca 52Ca42Ca40Ca38Ca\n000\n1525\n34473737\n3904\n2206\n3695\n0 00 0 0 0 00+ ++ + + + ++\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n3\n3 3 3\n3\n3\n3 3\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212(   ) \nFIG. 3: Systematics of the first 2+ and 3\u2212 excitations along\nthe even-even Ca isotopic chain (data from Ref. [17, 18, 19]).\njectile with two f7\/2 valence protons and no valence neu-\ntrons. The same reasoning leads to the complementary\nconclusion that the sizable cross section to the 3392(14)\nkeV state is a direct indication of a proton excitation of\n3992(14) keV. Taking account of the closed-shell charac-\nter of the 54Ti projectile and of the 52Ca residue, this\nsuggests that the two-proton knockout mechanism will\nbe an important tool for exploring cross-shell proton ex-\ncitations in neutron-rich systems.\nClearly, this first principles reasoning requires substan-\ntiation by more detailed calculations. While the sud-\nden, direct nature of the two-proton removal reaction was\nidentified in Ref. [6], the associated two-proton struc-\ntures and reaction mechanism were treated only approx-\nimately. A more complete formalism, using eikonal the-\nory and shell-model wave functions, has been developed\nsince for the two-nucleon stripping (inelastic breakup)\nmechanism [20]. This formalism has now been extended\nto include a complete calculation of removal events in\nwhich one proton is absorbed (stripped) and a second\nis elastically dissociated (diffracted) by the target. The\n(smaller) cross section for elastic dissociation of both\n(strongly-bound) protons is estimated as well. Details\nwill be presented elsewhere [21]. Of relevance here is\nthat, for four test-case sd-shell nuclei, the calculated in-\nclusive cross sections overpredict the measured values\nby a factor of two [21], requiring a suppression factor,\nRs(2N) \u2248 0.5, of the shell-model strengths: the analog\nof the well-documented suppression seen in nuclear and\nelectron-induced single-nucleon knockout reactions [22].\nThe eikonal S-matrices were calculated from the\nresidue and target one-body matter densities using the\noptical limit of Glauber\u2019s multiple scattering theory\n[23, 24]. A Gaussian nucleon-nucleon (NN) effective in-\nteraction was assumed [25] with a range of 0.5 fm and a\nstrength determined, in the usual way, by the free pp and\nnp cross sections and the real-to-imaginary ratios of the\nforward NN scattering amplitudes [26]. The 9Be density\nwas of Gaussian form with a rms matter radius of 2.36\nfm [27]. The density of 52Ca was taken from a spherical\nSkyrme (SkX) Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation [28], with\na rms matter radius of 3.632 fm.\nThe protons were assumed to occupy fp- and sd-shell\nmodel orbitals with spectroscopic amplitudes obtained\nusing the code OXBASH [29]. Their single-particle wave\nfunctions were calculated in Woods-Saxon potential wells\nwith fixed diffuseness (a = 0.70 fm) and radius param-\neters (r0) adjusted to reproduce the rms radii of the\nproton single-particle states given by the HF calculation\nabove [4]. The strengths of the binding potentials were\nadjusted to support bound eigenstates with the physi-\ncal ground- and excited-state separation energies. The\nground-state to ground-state two-proton separation en-\nergy for 54Ti was calculated to be S2p = 27.83 MeV, in\nagreement with the measured S2p = 27.66(71) MeV [30].\nThe nuclear structure input to the cross section calcu-\nlations was also based on the following additional con-\nsiderations. While neutron excitations of fp-shell nu-\nclei have been the subject of much recent attention and\nmodern effective interactions have been developed that\nreproduce the data satisfactorily [8, 9, 11, 12, 13], the\nsame cannot yet be said for the proton excitations rele-\nvant for the present work. Here, calculations were carried\nout with the modified WBMB Hamiltonian of Ref.[31],\nwhich is able to describe the low-level structure of 50K\nand the rather unusual characteristics of its \u03b2 decay to\n50Ca. This interaction results in a 0\u2212 50K ground state\nand a 2\u2212 excitation at 550 keV. The situation is reversed\nin 52K, and the 2\u2212 level becomes the ground state while\nthe 0\u2212 excitation is calculated to be located at 2.3 MeV.\nThese 52K ground state Ipi quantum numbers agree with\nthe values inferred in the most recent \u03b2-decay study [17].\nThe calculations also account for the observed feeding of\n52Ca levels through (i) a first forbidden transition to the\n2+1 level and (ii) a Gamow Teller (GT) transition to the\n3\u2212 state, as well as for the absence of direct feeding of\nthe ground state (first forbidden GT transition).\nBesides the 52Ca ground state, the cross section cal-\nculations also required proton wave functions for the 3\u2212\nlevel and for positive-parity excitations associated with\ntwo holes in the sd shell. The WBMB interaction places\nthe negative-parity states \u223c 3 MeV above the experi-\nmental value, illustrating the difficulties with the inter-\naction alluded to above. (Attempts with the interaction\nof Ref. [32] result in a similar problem). Nevertheless,\nthe negative-parity 52Ca spectrum has a 3\u2212 state as its\nlowest excitation. The need to consider two particle-two\nhole excitations in two-proton knockout comes from the\nobservation that, in 48Ca, a 4.28 MeV, 0+ state with this\nintrinsic structure (see Fig. 1 in [28]) lies within 225 keV\nof the 3\u2212 level. The presence of a similar level in the same\nenergy range in 52Ca cannot be ruled out. Unfortunately,\nits excitation energy cannot be readily estimated [33],\nand in this case as well the cross-shell calculations can\nonly be viewed as qualitative.\nWith the wave functions derived in this manner, the\n4calculated fp-shell, two-proton knockout partial cross\nsection to the 52Ca 0+ ground state is 0.38 mb. Com-\nparison with the measured value, 0.21(3) mb, yields the\nratio Rs(2N) = 0.55(8), in agreement with the available\nsd-shell systematics [21]. The direct population of the\n2+1 state is predicted to be very small as this level cor-\nresponds to a neutron excitation: the calculated value\nof 0.04 mb is well below the detection sensitivity of the\npresent measurements.\nIn view of the uncertainties discussed above, the knock-\nout cross section calculations to the other excited states\nwere restricted to the simplest shell-model configura-\ntions expected. Thus, 3\u2212 states with (i) one-proton hole\nin the d3\/2 shell and (ii) one-proton hole in the s1\/2\nstate were considered (i.e., the configurations were of\nthe type pi((d3\/2)\n\u22121\n\u00d7 (f7\/2)\n+1), for example). Similarly,\nfor the 0+ states, configurations with (iii) two d3\/2 pro-\nton holes and (iv) two s1\/2 proton holes were included.\nThe calculated two-proton knockout cross sections (tak-\ning Rs(2N) = 0.55) are 0.13, 0.19, 0.09 and 0.09 mb,\nrespectively. As the physical lowest 3\u2212 state is expected\nto correspond to a linear combination of configurations\n(i) and (ii), their sum, 0.32 mb, can be used as a upper\nlimit of the two-proton knockout cross section, assuming\ncoherent superposition. A similar upper limit to the 0+2\nlevel is then 0.18 mb.\nAn interpretation of the experimental results is, there-\nfore, that the 3990 keV level can be associated with the\n3\u2212 state seen in 52K \u03b2 decay, and that the two-proton\nknockout cross section of 0.11(3) mb is several times\nweaker than the maximum allowed by the 3\u2212 calcula-\ntion. The absence of any other notable strength in the\nexperimental spectrum then suggests that the 0+2 state\nlies above the neutron threshold of 4.7(7) MeV. In ad-\ndition, it is worth noting that the two-proton knockout\ncross sections summed over all one- and two-proton hole\nstates in the sd-shell are 1.93 and 9.51 mb, respectively.\nMost of these strengths proceed towards levels above the\nneutron separation energy and lead to states in lighter\nCa isotopes that cannot be discerned by the experiment.\nIn summary, the present work has demonstrated\nthat two-proton knockout reactions represent an im-\nportant tool in the arsenal of experimental techniques\naimed at the study of neutron-rich nuclei. The specific\n9Be(54Ti,52Ca+\u03b3)X reaction investigated here was in-\nstrumental in identifying a proton cross-shell excitation\nin an exotic nucleus with large neutron excess. In ad-\ndition, the data provided confirmation of the N = 32\nsub-shell closure in 54Ti. Finally, the reduction of the\nspectroscopic strength, verified thus far only for sd-shell\nnuclei (Rs(2N) \u2248 0.5) was found to apply to this fp-shell\nnucleus as well.\nThis work was supported by the National Science\nFoundation under Grants No. PHY-0110253, PHY-\n9875122, and PHY-0244453, by the U.S. Department of\nEnergy, Office of Nuclear Physics, under Contract No.\nW31-109-ENG-38, the UK Engineering and Physical Sci-\nences Research Council (grant EP\/D003628) and by Pol-\nish Scientific Committee Grant No. 1P03B 059 29.\n[1] M.G.
