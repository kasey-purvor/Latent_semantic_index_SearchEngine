INTRODUCTION\nThroughout L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F . The\nrelationship between the structure of L and that of the latticeL\u00f0L\u00de of all subalgebras\nof L has been studied by many authors. Much is known about modular subalgebras\n(modular elements in L\u00f0L\u00de) through a number of investigations including Amayo\nand Schwarz (1980), Gein (1987a,b), Varea (1989, 1990, 1993). Modular subalgebras\nof dimension greater than one which are not quasi-ideals were exhibited in Varea\n(1993). Other lattice conditions, together with their duals, have also been studied.\nThese include semimodular, upper semimodular, lower semimodular, upper\nmodular, lower modular and their respective duals (see Bowman and Towers, 1989,\nfor definitions). For a selection of results on these conditions see Gein (1976),\nVarea (1983, 1999), Gein and Varea (1992), Lashi (1986), Towers (1986, 1997),\nBowman and Varea (1997). Moreover, it has been proved that none non-solvable\nlocally finite-dimensional Lie algebra admits a lattice isomorphism on a solvable\nLie algebra, except the three-dimensional non-split simple, provided that the ground\nfield is perfect of characteristic not 2 or 3 (see Gein and Varea, 1992).\nMany of the lattice conditions imposed so far have proved to be very strong,\nforcing the algebra to be abelian, almost abelian, supersolvable, a m-algebra (this\nmeans that every proper subalgebra has dimension one) or an algebra direct sum\nof the above. Typically, see Gein (1987a), Varea (1993, 1999). In this paper we shall\nintroduce a condition that is less restrictive.\nRecall that an element U of a latticeL is called lower modular inL if, given any\nelement B ofL with U _ B covering U , then B covers U ^ B. A subalgebra U of a Lie\nalgebra L is called lower modular in L (lm in L) if it is a lower modular element in the\nlattice of subalgebras of L.\nIn this paper, we impose the condition that every minimal subalgebra of L is lm\nin L. We prove that this condition is equivalent to the condition that if a subalgebra\nU of L has a maximal subalgebra of dimension one then every maximal subalgebra\nof U has dimension one. We shall call such an algebra lm(0). The situation depends\nessentially on the ground field. For example, we will obtain that if the field is alge-\nbraically closed then all Lie algebras are lm(0), and over other any field there are\neven simple Lie algebras which are not lm(0). On the other hand, for each element\na of any Lie algebra L, denote by SL\u00f0a\u00de the largest subalgebra of L containing a\non which ad a is split. This subalgebra was introduced in Barnes and Newell\n(1970). In our study on lm(0)-algebras, we obtain some properties of the intersection\nS\u00f0L\u00de of all SL\u00f0a\u00de which might have some interest by themselves.\nIn Sec. 2 we obtain several properties of the subalgebra S\u00f0L\u00de which will be used\nin the sequel. We prove that if L0 is nilpotent then L=CL\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL\u00de is supersolvable and\nevery chief factor of L below S\u00f0L\u00deL is one-dimensional. If\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F and char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0,\nthen S\u00f0L\u00de is supersolvable. Also, we prove that if char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0 and if T is a Levi\n2 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nsubalgebra of a Lie algebra L, then S\u00f0L\u00deEL and S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe T decomposes into a direct\nsum of ideals A and B such that S\u00f0A\u00de \u00bc A and S\u00f0B\u00de \u00bc 0.\nIn Sec. 3 we assemble some general results on lm(0)-algebras. We prove that\nevery homomorphic image of S\u00f0L\u00de is lm(0). Over an algebraically closed field every\nLie algebra is lm(0), whereas over any algebraically non-closed field there are simple\nLie algebras that are not lm(0). We prove that either S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc L, L=S\u00f0L\u00deL is semi-\nsimple or else L=S\u00f0L\u00deL is not lm(0). Also, in this section we introduce some other\nclasses of Lie algebras which might have some interest by themselves.\nSection 4 is concerned with solvable lm(0)-algebras over arbitrary fields. It\nis shown that every strongly solvable lm(0)-algebra with trivial Frattini ideal is\nsupersolvable, and that every strongly solvable, non-supersolvable, Lie algebra is an\nextension of a Lie algebra that is not lm(0) by an lm(0)-algebra.\nIn the next two sections many of the results require the underlying field to have\ncharacteristic zero. Non-solvable lm(0)-algebras are considered in Sec. 5. A major\nresult classifies such algebras having an abelian radical. In Sec. 6 we determine the\nLie algebras all of whose proper homomorphic images are lm(0).\nSection 7 concerns lm(0)-algebras over a field F of characteristic p > 0. First, we\nprove that the derived subalgebra of a centerless ad-semisimple Lie algebra has no\nnon-singular derivations, provided that F is perfect and p > 3. Then, we obtain that\nevery ad-semisimple Lie algebra over such a field F is lm(0). Finally we investigate\nwhen the simple Lie algebras having a maximal subalgebra of codimension one\nare lm(0). In particular we consider the Zassenhaus algebras.\nThroughout L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F . An\nelement A of a lattice L is said to be an atom (resp. co-atom) if it is minimal (resp.\nmaximal) inL. Let A, B be elements of a latticeL. We say that B covers A if A < B\nand A is maximal in B. If L is a Lie algebra, we denote by L\u00f0L\u00de the lattice of all\nsubalgebras of L. A Lie algebra L is said to be strongly solvable if its derived\nsubalgebra, L0, is nilpotent. We shall denote the nilradical of L by Nil\u00f0L\u00de. If U is\na subalgebra of L, we denote by UL the largest ideal of L contained in U and by\nCL\u00f0U\u00de the centralizer of U in L. We shall denote the center of L by Z\u00f0L\u00de.\n2. THE SUBALGEBRA S(L)\nFollowing Barnes and Newell (1970), for each element a 2 L we denote by SL\u00f0a\u00de\nthe largest subalgebra of L containing a on which ad a is split. We denote by S\u00f0L\u00de the\nintersection of all SL\u00f0a\u00de. In this section we obtain several properties of the subalgebra\nS\u00f0L\u00de which will be used in the sequel. Note that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc L means that ad x is split on\nF for every x 2 L. In this case, we will say that the Lie algebra L is completely split;\nwhile if S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0, we will say that L is completely non-split. We start with the\nfollowing lemma which is easily checked.\nLemma 2.1. Let L be any Lie algebra. Let U \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de and N EL such that\nN \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de. Then S\u00f0U\u00de \u00bc U and S\u00f0L=N\u00de \u00bc S\u00f0L\u00de=N .\nWe say that an ideal I of a Lie algebra L is supersolvably immersed in L if every\nchief factor of L below I is one dimensional.

Now we obtain the following result which is an extension of\nLemma 2.4 of Barnes and Newell (1970).\nProposition 2.2. Let F be an arbitrary field.\n(1) Let L0 be nilpotent. Then the following hold:\n(a) Every minimal ideal of L contained in S\u00f0L\u00de is one-dimensional.\n(b) S\u00f0L\u00deL is the largest ideal of L which is supersolvably immersed in L,\nand L=CL\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL\u00de is supersolvable.\n(2) (Lemma 2.4 of Barnes and Newell, 1970). If S\u00f0L\u00de0 is nilpotent, then S\u00f0L\u00de is\nsupersolvable.\nProof. (1) Let A be a minimal ideal of L contained in S\u00f0L\u00de. As L0 is nilpotent,\nA \u0001 Z\u00f0Nil\u00f0L\u00de\u00de. Then we can define a representation r : L=Nil\u00f0L\u00de\u0002!A by means\nof r\u00f0x\u00feNil\u00f0L\u00de\u00de\u00f0a\u00de \u00bc \u00bdx; a\u0003 for every x 2 L. Since L0 \u0001 Nil\u00f0L\u00de, we have that\nr\u00f0L=Nil\u00f0L\u00de\u00de is a commuting family of split linear mappings. Hence these linear maps\nhave a common eigenvector. Minimality of A implies that dimA \u00bc 1. To prove (b),\nlet H=K be a chief factor of L below S\u00f0L\u00deL. By using Lemma 2.1 and (a) we obtain\nthat dimH=K \u00bc 1. The last assertion in (b) follows from Varea (1989).\n(2) is a direct consequence of (1) and Lemma 2.1.\nLemma 2.3. Let char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0. Then, S\u00f0L\u00de is a characteristic ideal of L.\nProof. Note that S\u00f0L\u00de is invariant under every automorphism of L. So, the result\nfollows from Theorem 3.1 of Towers (1973) and Chevalley (1968).\nLet P be a simple Lie algebra of characteristic zero. As S\u00f0P\u00de is an ideal of P, we\nhave that either S\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc 0 or S\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc P. When ffiffiffiFp 6\u0001 F , we see that S\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc 0 (since\nP contains a subalgebra isomorphic to sl\u00f02\u00de which is not completely split). Now,\nlet T be a semisimple Lie algebra. As S\u00f0T\u00de is an ideal of T , there exists an ideal\nK\u00f0T\u00de of T such that T \u00bc S\u00f0T\u00de \u0004 K\u00f0T\u00de. We see that K\u00f0T\u00de is the sum of the minimal\nideals of T which are completely non-split and S\u00f0T\u00de is the sum of those which are\ncompletely split. When\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F , S\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc 0.\nTheorem 2.4. Let char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0. Let T be any Levi subalgebra of a Lie algebra L.\nLet T \u00bc S\u00f0T\u00de \u0004 K\u00f0T\u00de be the decomposition of T into its completely split and\ncompletely non-split components. Then the following hold:\n(i) \u00bdS\u00f0L\u00de;K\u00f0T\u00de\u0003 \u00bc 0;\n(ii) S\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe S\u00f0T\u00de\u00de \u00bc S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe S\u00f0T\u00de: that is S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe S\u00f0T\u00de is completely split;\n(iii) S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe T is a direct sum of a completely split Lie algebra and a\ncompletely non-split semisimple Lie algebra; and\n(iv) If\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F , then S\u00f0L\u00de is supersolvable.\nProof. (i) We may suppose without loss of generality that K\u00f0T\u00de is simple. For\nshort, put K \u00bc K\u00f0T\u00de. As S\u00f0K\u00de \u00bc 0, there must exist an element x 2 K such that\nadK\u00f0x\u00de is not split on F . Let x \u00bc s\u00fe n be the decomposition of x into its semisimple\n4 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nand nilpotent components, s, n 2 K, respectively. We see that adK\u00f0s\u00de is not split on F\neither. It is well-known that there exists a Cartan subalgebra H of K containing s. As\nS\u00f0L\u00de is an ideal of L (see Lemma 2.3), we have that S\u00f0L\u00de is a K-module. This yields\nthat ad\u00f0s\u00dejS\u00f0L\u00de is semisimple too (see Jacobson, 1979). As ad\u00f0s\u00dejS\u00f0L\u00de splits on F , we get\nthat ad\u00f0s\u00dejS\u00f0L\u00de is diagonalizable on F . On the other hand, let O be an algebraic\nclosure of F and consider the Lie algebra LO \u00bc L\u0005F O over O. We see that HO is\na Cartan subalgebra of KO and that KO is semisimple. Let\nKO \u00bc HO \u0004 S\u00f0KO\u00dea\nbe the decomposition of KO into its root spaces relative to HO. As adKs is not split\non F , it follows that a\u00f0s\u00de 62 F for some root a. Let a be such a root. Put \u00f0KO\u00dea \u00bc Oea.\nLet a 2 S\u00f0L\u00de be an eigenvector of ad\u00f0s\u00dejS\u00f0L\u00de and let t 2 F be its corresponding eigen-\nvalue. Then we see that \u00bda; ea\u0003 \u00bc 0. Otherwise t\u00fe a\u00f0s\u00de would be an eigenvalue\nof ad\u00f0s\u00dejS\u00f0L\u00de and then t\u00fe a\u00f0s\u00de 2 F , which is a contradiction. This yields that\nKO \\ CLO\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00de\u00deO 6\u00bc 0 and hence K \\ CL\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00de\u00de 6\u00bc 0. As K is simple, it follows that\nK \u0001 CL\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00de\u00de, as required.\n(ii) Clearly, S\u00f0L\u00de \\ T E S\u00f0T\u00de. Since S\u00f0T\u00de is semisimple, there exists an ideal N\nof S\u00f0T\u00de such that S\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc \u00f0S\u00f0L\u00de \\ T\u00de \u0004 N . As N \u0001 S\u00f0T\u00de, we see that N is completely\nsplit. Write U \u00bc S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe S\u00f0T\u00de. We have U \u00bc S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe N and S\u00f0L\u00de \\ N \u00bc 0. Let\n0 6\u00bc x 2 U . We want to prove that adu\u00f0x\u00de is split. Decompose x \u00bc a\u00fe b where\na 2 S\u00f0L\u00de and b 2 N . Let O be an algebraic closure of F and let UO \u00bc U \u0005F O. Let\na 2 O be an eigenvalue of adUO\u00f0x\u00de. We need to prove that a 2 F . We have that there\nexists 0 6\u00bc y 2 UO such that \u00bdy; x\u0003 \u00bc ay. Decompose y \u00bc a0 \u00fe b0 where a0 2 S\u00f0L\u00deO and\nb0 2 NO. We have\n\u00bdy; x\u0003 \u00bc \u00bda0; a\u0003 \u00fe \u00bda0; b\u0003 \u00fe \u00bdb0; a\u0003 \u00fe \u00bdb0; b\u0003 \u00bc a\u00f0a0 \u00fe b0\u00de:\nAs \u00bda0; a\u0003 \u00fe \u00bda0; b\u0003 \u00fe \u00bdb0; a\u0003 2 S\u00f0L\u00deO and \u00bdb0; b\u0003 2 NO and since S\u00f0L\u00deO \\ NO \u00bc 0, it\nfollows that \u00bdb0; b\u0003 \u00bc ab0 and \u00bda0; a\u0003 \u00fe \u00bda0; b\u0003 \u00fe \u00bdb0; a\u0003 \u00bc aa0. If b0 6\u00bc 0, we see that a\nis an eigenvalue of adN \u00f0b\u00de. So, a 2 F since S\u00f0N\u00de \u00bc N . Now assume b0 \u00bc 0. Then\nwe have a0 6\u00bc 0 and \u00bda0; a\u00fe b\u0003 \u00bc aa0. This yields that a is an eigenvalue of\nadjS\u00f0L\u00de\u00f0a\u00fe b\u00de and hence a 2 F , since S\u00f0L\u00de \u0001 SL\u00f0a\u00fe b\u00de. We deduce that adux is split\non F , for every x 2 U , so that S\u00f0U\u00de \u00bc U , as required.\n(iii) Since S\u00f0L\u00de \\ T \u0001 S\u00f0T\u00de and \u00bdS\u00f0L\u00de;K\u00f0T\u00de\u0003 \u00bc 0, we have that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe T \u00bc\n\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe S\u00f0T\u00de\u00de \u0004 K\u00f0T\u00de.

GENERAL RESULTS ON lm(0)-ALGEBRAS\nFirst we give the following result:\nProposition 3.1. Let F be any field. For a Lie algebra L the following are\nequivalent:\n(i) Every minimal subalgebra of L is lower modular.\n(ii) If a subalgebra U of L has a maximal subalgebra of dimension one, then\nevery maximal subalgebra of U has dimension one.\nProof. (i) \u00bc) (ii) Let x 2 U \u0001 L such that Fx is maximal in U . Let M be a max-\nimal subalgebra of U distinct from Fx. We see that Fx _M \u00bc U . As Fx is lm in L, it\nfollows that M \\ Fx is maximal in M. Since M \\ Fx \u00bc 0, dimM \u00bc 1.\n(ii) \u00bc) (i) Let 0 6\u00bc x 2 L. Assume that Fx is maximal in Fx _ B for some\nsubalgebra B of L. If Fx \u0001 B, then Fx _ B \u00bc B. So, Fx \\ B is maximal in B. Then\nsuppose Fx 6\u0001 B. We have that B is a proper subalgebra of Fx _ B. By (ii), dimB \u00bc 1.\nThis yields that Fx \\ B is maximal in B and hence Fx is lm in L.\nA Lie algebra satisfying the two equivalent conditions in Proposition 3.1 is called\nlm(0)-algebra. A lattice L is called lm(0) if every atom is lower modular. As a first\nconsequence we obtain the following characterization of lattices of subalgebras of\nlm(0)-algebras.\nCorollary 3.2. Let char\u00f0F\u00de 6\u00bc 2; 3. Let L be the lattice of subalgebras of a Lie\nalgebra. ThenL is lm\u00f00\u00de if and only if the interval \u00bd0 : B\u0003 ofL is a modular lattice\nfor every element B of L covering an atom.\nProof. Let L be a Lie algebra over F such thatL ffiL\u00f0L\u00de. Let us first supposeL is\nlm(0). Let B be an element of L covering an atom A of L. Let U denote the sub-\nalgebra of L corresponding to B. Then U has a one-dimensional maximal subalgebra.\nBy Proposition 3.1 it follows that every proper subalgebra of U has dimension one.\nSo, the subalgebra lattice L\u00f0U\u00de of U is modular. As the interval \u00bd0 :B\u0003 of the lattice\nL is isomorphic to the lattice L\u00f0U\u00de, it follows that \u00bd0 :B\u0003 is a modular lattice. In\norder to prove the converse, let U be a subalgebra of L having a maximal subalgebra\nA of dimension one. We have that U covers the atom A in the lattice of subalgebras\nof L. Then, by hypothesis, the lattice of subalgebras of U is modular. By Corollary 5\nof Varea (1995), it follows that every proper subalgebra of U has dimension one. By\nusing Proposition 3.1, we obtain that L is lm(0). The proof is now complete.\nAn easy consequence of Proposition 3.1 is the following.\nCorollary 3.3.\n(i) Every supersolvable Lie algebra is lm\u00f00\u00de.\n(ii) For every Lie algebra L, each homomorphic image of S\u00f0L\u00de is lm\u00f00\u00de.\n(iii) Over algebraically closed fields, EVERY Lie algebra is lm\u00f00\u00de.\n6 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nProof. (i) follows from the well-known result that every maximal subalgebra of a\nsupersolvable Lie algebra has codimension one.\n(ii) By Lemma 2.1 it suffices to prove that S\u00f0L\u00de is lm(0) for every Lie algebra L.\nTo do that, let U be a subalgebra of S\u00f0L\u00de having a maximal subalgebra M of\ndimension one. Pick 0 6\u00bc x 2 M and consider the action of x on the vector space\nU=M. Since adS\u00f0L\u00dex is split, there exist u 2 U , u 62 M, and a 2 F such that\n\u00bdx; u\u0003 \u0007 au\u00f0modM\u00de. It follows that M \u00fe Fu is a subalgebra of U . By the maximality\nof M, we have M \u00fe Fu \u00bc U . So, dimU \u00bc 2. Therefore S\u00f0L\u00de is lm(0).\n(iii) follows from (ii) and the fact that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc L for every Lie algebra L over an\nalgebraically closed field.\nFor algebraically non-closed fields, the situation is quite different. Here we will\nprove that, for any such fields, there are simple Lie algebras which are not lm(0). In\nthe next section, we will prove that every strongly solvable Lie algebra can be\nobtained as an extension of a Lie algebra which is not lm(0) by an lm(0)-algebra.\nAlso, we note that the three-dimensional split simple Lie algebra is lm(0) wheneverffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F or char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 2, but it is not lm(0) in the case where ffiffiffiFp 6\u0001 F and\nchar\u00f0F\u00de 6\u00bc 2.\nProposition 3.4. Let L be a simple, but not central-simple, Lie algebra having an\nelement x such that ad x has a nonzero eigenvalue in F . Then L is not lm\u00f00\u00de.\nProof. By our hypothesis, there exists an element x 2 L such that ad x has a\nnonzero eigenvalue t in F . So, there exists e 2 L such that \u00bde; x\u0003 \u00bc te. Put x0 \u00bc\nt\u00021x. Then, we have \u00bde; x0\u0003 \u00bc e. Let G be the centroid of L. As L is not central-simple,\nG 6\u00bc F . Then, we can take g 2 G, g 62 F . Let n be the degree of the minimum\npolynomial of g over F . So n > 1. Consider the vector subspace A of L spanned by\ne, g\u00f0e\u00de, . . . , gn\u00021\u00f0e\u00de. We see that e, g\u00f0e\u00de, . . . , gn\u00021\u00f0e\u00de is a basis for A and that A is\nan abelian subalgebra of L. Also, we see \u00bde;g\u00f0x0\u00de\u0003 \u00bc g\u00f0\u00bde;x0\u0003\u00de \u00bc g\u00f0e\u00de and \u00bdgi\u00f0e\u00de;g\u00f0x0\u00de\u0003 \u00bc\ng\u00f0\u00bdgi\u00f0e\u00de; x0\u0003\u00de \u00bc g\u00f0g\u00f0\u00bdgi\u00021\u00f0e\u00de; x0\u0003\u00de\u00de \u00bc gi\u00fe1\u00f0\u00bde; x0\u0003\u00de \u00bc gi\u00fe1\u00f0e\u00de, for every 1 \u0001 i \u0001 r. As\ngn can be decomposed into a linear combination of 1, g, . . . , gn\u00021 with coefficients\nin F , it follows that \u00bdA; g\u00f0x0\u00de\u0003 \b A. We see that the corresponding matrix\nto the transformation ad\u00f0g\u00f0x0\u00de\u00dejA is the companion matrix to the minimum\npolynomial of g over F . So ad\u00f0g\u00f0x0\u00de\u00dejA has no eigenvalues in F . This yields that L\nis not lm(0).\nCorollary 3.5. For every algebraically non-closed field F , there exist simple Lie\nalgebras which are not lm\u00f00\u00de.\nProof. Pick an element o in an algebraic closure O of F such that o 62 F .\nBy Proposition 3.4, the Lie algebra over F obtained from the three-dimensional\nsplit simple Lie algebra over F\u00f0o\u00de by restricting the field of scalars, is not\nlm(0).\nNext we study the class of lm(0)-algebras and relations between it and certain\nother classes of Lie algebras. These classes might have some interest by themselves.\nLie Algebras Whose Minimal Subalgebras Are Lower Modular 7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nIf X is a class of Lie algebras, we will denote by sX the class of all subalgebras of\nX-algebras.\nThe first class we introduce is defined in terms of the lattice theory: let Y denote\nthe class of Lie algebras L such that if an atom of L\u00f0L\u00de is a co-atom so is every\natom. The class Y is a very large class. Indeed\nLemma 3.6. (i) For any field, the only Lie algebras which are not in Y are those\nLie algebras L such that L \u00bc L0 \u00fe Fx with x acting irreducibly on L0 and dimL0 > 1,\nand the simple Lie algebras of rank one having a one-dimensional maximal\nsubalgebra and subalgebras of dimension greater than one.\n(ii) If char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0, then a Lie algebra L is not in Y if and only if either\nL \u00bc A\u00fe Fx where A is a proper minimal abelian ideal of L and dimA > 1, or\nL ffi sl\u00f02\u00de and ffiffiffiFp 6\u0001 F .\nProof. This is straightforward.\nCorollary 3.7. (i) lm\u00f00\u00de \u00bc sY.\n(ii) If char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0, then L is minimal non-lm\u00f00\u00de (this means that every proper\nsubalgebra of L is lm\u00f00\u00de but L is not) if and only if L 62 Y.\nNext, we introduce the class P1 of Lie algebras L such that every minimal ideal\nof L is one dimensional or L \u00bc 0. This class of Lie algebras is contained in the\nclass P2 of Lie algebras L in which every minimal ideal lies in S\u00f0L\u00de. Let P3 be the\nclass of Lie algebras L such that every abelian ideal of L is contained in S\u00f0L\u00de. So that\nL 2 P3 if and only if the transformation ad\u00f0x\u00dejA is split for every abelian ideal A of L\nand every x 2 L. Let P4 be the class of Lie algebras L such that either S\u00f0L\u00de 6\u00bc 0 or\nL \u00bc 0.\nSome relationships between these classes are given in the following result.\nTheorem 3.8. (i) For any field, P1 \b P2 \b P4 \\Y, and lm\u00f00\u00de \b sP3.\n(ii) If char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0, then sP4 \b lm\u00f00\u00de and every Lie algebra in sP1 is solvable.\nProof. (i) Clearly, P1 \b P2 and P2 \b P4. Now let L 2 P2. To prove that L 2 Y,\nassume that L has a maximal subalgebra M of dimension one. Put M \u00bc Fx. Take a\nminimal ideal N of L. We have N \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de and so ad\u00f0x\u00dejN is split. Thus there exists\n0 6\u00bc y 2 N such that \u00bdx; y\u0003 \u00bc ty for some t 2 F . This yields dimL \u00bc 2 and hence\nL 2 Y. Now let L be lm(0). To prove that L 2 sP3, it suffices to show that\nL 2 P3. Let A be an abelian ideal of L. Suppose A 6\u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de. Then there exists\nx 2 L, x 62 A such that A 6\u0001 SL\u00f0x\u00de. Let KL\u00f0x\u00de be the ad\u00f0x\u00de-invariant subspace of L\nsuch that L \u00bc SL\u00f0x\u00de \u00fe KL\u00f0x\u00de and SL\u00f0x\u00de \\ KL\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 0 (see Barnes and Newell,\n1970). We see that KL\u00f0x\u00de \\ A 6\u00bc 0 and \u00f0KL\u00f0x\u00de \\ A\u00de \u00fe Fx is a subalgebra of L. Take\na subalgebra M of \u00f0KL\u00f0x\u00de \\ A\u00de \u00fe Fx containing Fx and such that Fx is maximal in\nM. We have that \u00f0M \\ KL\u00f0x\u00de\u00de \\ A is an ideal of M and a maximal subalgebra of\nM. Since L is lm(0), it follows that dim\u00f0M \\ KL\u00f0x\u00de \\ A\u00de \u00bc 1. This yields that\n8 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nad\u00f0x\u00dejKL\u00f0x\u00de\\A has an eigenvalue in F , which is a contradiction. The proof of (i) is now\ncomplete.\n(ii) As char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0, every nonsolvable Lie algebra has a semisimple\nsubalgebra. Since, clearly, a Lie algebra in sP1 contains no semisimple subalgebras,\nit follows that every Lie algebra in sP1 is solvable. It remains only to show that\nsP4 \b lm\u00f00\u00de. Let L 2 sP4. We need only prove that L 2 Y. By Lemma 2.3 we have\nS\u00f0L\u00deEL. This yields that for each 0 6\u00bc x 2 L there exists a nonzero element y 2 S\u00f0L\u00de\nsuch that \u00bdx; y\u0003 \u00bc ty, where t 2 F . So, either dimL \u0001 2 or L has no maximal\nsubalgebras of dimension one. From this it follows that L 2 Y.\nLater in this paper, we show examples of Lie algebras L which are lm(0) and\nsuch that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0 (so that, in general, lm(0) is not contained in P4).\nCorollary 3.9. Let L be any Lie algebra. Then either L is completely split, L=S\u00f0L\u00deL\nis semisimple or else L=S\u00f0L\u00deL is not lm\u00f00\u00de.\nNext, we give some properties of the classes above introduced. Let L be a Lie\nalgebra which is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Lie algebras L1 and L2. A\nsubalgebra U of L is said to be a sub-direct summand of L if the canonical\nprojections p1 : U \u0002!L1 and p2 : U \u0002!L2 are both surjective. A class X of Lie\nalgebras is called R0-closed if every sub-direct summand of L1 \u0004 L2 is in X when-\never L1 and L2 both lie in X (or equivalently if, whenever L=A 2 X and L=B 2 X,\nwhere A and B are ideals of the Lie algebra L, it always follows that\nL=A \\ B 2 X).\nLemma 3.10. Let X be a class of Lie algebras which is R0-closed. Then the class\nsX is R0-closed too.\nProof. Let L1, L2 2 sX. Write L \u00bc L1 \u0004 L2. Let U \u0001 L. We see that U is a\nsub-direct summand of p1\u00f0U\u00de \u0004 p2\u00f0U\u00de. Since pi\u00f0U\u00de \u0001 Li 2 sX, for i \u00bc 1; 2, it follows\nthat pi\u00f0U\u00de 2 X. Then, by our hypothesis, U 2 X too.\nProposition 3.11. The classes Pi for 1 \u0001 i \u0001 4 and the class Y are all R0-closed\nand hence so are the classes sPi for 1 \u0001 i \u0001 4 and the class of lm\u00f00\u00de-algebras.\nProof. This is straightforward.\nWe will denote by Asoc\u00f0L\u00de the sum of all abelian minimal ideals of the Lie\nalgebra L and call it the abelian socle of L. The Frattini subalgebra, Fr\u00f0L\u00de, of a\nLie algebra L is defined to be the intersection of all maximal subalgebras of L. It\nis well-known that Fr\u00f0L\u00de is an ideal of L whenever either L is solvable or else\nchar\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0, (see Towers, 1973). However, for any algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic greater than 7, there exist simple Lie algebras having non-trivial\nFrattini subalgebra (see Varea, 1993). We will denote by f\u00f0L\u00de the largest ideal of\nL contained in Fr\u00f0L\u00de. A Lie algebra L is said to be f-free if f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0.\nWe finish this section giving, for a f-free and P1-algebra L, a relationship\nbetween the dimensions of L, the center of L and the abelian socle of L.\nLie Algebras Whose Minimal Subalgebras Are Lower Modular 9\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nProposition 3.12.

Then assume L is non-abelian.\nSince f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0, by Theorem 7.3 of Towers (1973) there exists B \u0001 L such that\nL \u00bc Asoc\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe B and B \\Asoc\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0. We see that B contains no nonzero ideals\nof L; since otherwise, B would contain a minimal ideal of L which is of dimension\none (because L 2 P1), a contradiction. On the other hand, we have Asoc\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc\nZ\u00f0L\u00de \u0004 A1 \u0004 \t \t \t \u0004 Ar where each Ai is an abelian minimal ideal of L and r \n 0.\nWe have r > 0, since otherwise we would have B \/ L, which is a contradiction. Also,\nwe have dimAi \u00bc 1 for every i. Write Ai \u00bc Fai. Define ri : L\u0002!Fai by means of\nri\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u00bdai; x\u0003 for every x 2 L. Since ai 62 Z\u00f0L\u00de, we see dimL=CL\u00f0ai\u00de \u00bc 1 for every i.\nWrite C \u00bc CL\u00f0a1\u00de \\ \t \t \t \\ CL\u00f0ar\u00de.

ON SOLVABLE lm(0)-ALGEBRAS OVER\nARBITRARY FIELDS\nA Lie algebra L is said to be strongly solvable if its derived subalgebra L0 is\nnilpotent. It is well-known that for fields of characteristic zero, every solvable Lie\nalgebra is strongly solvable (see Jacobson, 1979). For arbitrary fields, every super\nsolvable Lie algebra is strongly solvable. For algebraically closed fields, every\nstrongly solvable Lie algebra is supersolvable (Proposition 2.2(2)).\nTheorem 4.1.\n(i) For solvable Lie algebras, sP1 \b sP2 \u00bc lm\u00f00\u00de \u00bc sP3 \u00bc sP4.\n(ii) For strongly solvable Lie algebras, sP1 \u00bc lm\u00f00\u00de.\nProof. (i) From Theorem 3.8 and Corollary 3.7 it follows that sP1 \b sP2 \b\nlm\u00f00\u00de \b sP3. For solvable Lie algebras it is trivial that P3 \b P2 \\P4. Let\n0 6\u00bc L 2 sP4 and let L be solvable. We need only to prove that L is lm(0). Assume\nthat L is not lm(0). We may suppose, without loss of generality, that every proper\nsubalgebra of L is lm(0). By Corollary 3.7, we have L 62 Y. By Lemma 3.6, L has\na unique abelian minimal ideal A of dimension greater than one and codimension\none in L. Let x 2 L, x 62 A. We see that Fx is maximal in L and ad\u00f0x\u00dejA is not split.\nThis yields that SL\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc Fx and therefore S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0. This contradicts the fact that\nL 2 P4. The proof of (i) is complete.\n(ii) Let L be an lm(0)-algebra which is strongly solvable. We need only to\nprove that L 2 P1. To do that, let A be a minimal ideal of L. By Theorem 3.8, it\nfollows that A \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de. Then by Proposition 2.2, dimA \u00bc 1. This completes the\nproof.\n10 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nProposition 4.2. If L is strongly solvable and f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0, then either L is super-\nsolvable or L is not lm\u00f00\u00de.\nProof. Let L be strongly solvable and let f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0. Assume that L is lm(0). Then,\nby Theorem 4.1, we have that every minimal ideal of L is one dimensional. This\nyields that every maximal subalgebra of L which does not contain Asoc\u00f0L\u00de has\ncodimension one in L. On the other hand, since f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0 we have Nil\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc\nAsoc\u00f0L\u00de (see Theorem 7.4 of Towers, 1973). It follows that L=Asoc\u00f0L\u00de is abelian,\nsince L0 is nilpotent. This yields that every maximal subalgebra of L has codimension\none in L. Hence, by using Theorem 7 of Barnes (1967), we conclude that L is\nsupersolvable.\nNext, we prove that every strongly solvable, non-supersolvable Lie algebra has\nhomomorphic images which are NOT lm(0)-algebras.\nCorollary 4.3. Let F be any field. Let L be strongly solvable but not supersolvable.\nThen, none of the Lie algebras L=S\u00f0L\u00deL, L=f\u00f0L\u00de, L=\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL \\ f\u00f0L\u00de\u00de and\nL=\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL \u00fe f\u00f0L\u00de\u00de is lm\u00f00\u00de.\nProof. By Proposition 2.2(2), we have that S\u00f0L\u00de 6\u00bc L. Thus L=S\u00f0L\u00deL is not lm(0) by\nCorollary 3.9. By Theorem 6 of Barnes (1967), we have that L=f\u00f0L\u00de is not super-\nsolvable. So, L=f\u00f0L\u00de is not lm(0) by Proposition 4.2. To prove that L=\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL \\\nf\u00f0L\u00de\u00de is not lm(0), we may suppose without loss of generality that S\u00f0L\u00deL \\ f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0\nand f\u00f0L\u00de 6\u00bc 0. Then, we can take an abelian minimal ideal A of L contained in\nf\u00f0L\u00de. Since A 6\u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de, by Theorem 3.8, it follows that L is not lm(0). What remains\nto prove is that the Lie algebra L=\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL \u00fe f\u00f0L\u00de\u00de is not lm(0). By Proposition 2.2,\nwe have that \u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL \u00fe f\u00f0L\u00de\u00de=f\u00f0L\u00de is a supersolvably immersed ideal of L=f\u00f0L\u00de.\nThis yields that L=\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL \u00fe f\u00f0L\u00de\u00de is not supersolvable, since otherwise we would\nhave that L=f\u00f0L\u00de is supersolvable and then so is L, which is a contradiction. On\nthe other hand, we see that f\u00f0L=S\u00f0L\u00deL\u00de \u00bc S\u00f0L\u00deL \u00fe f\u00f0L\u00de. So, the algebra\nL=\u00f0S\u00f0L\u00deL \u00fe f\u00f0L\u00de\u00de is f-free. Then, the result follows from Proposition 4.2. The\nproof is now complete.\nCorollary 4.4. Every strongly solvable, non-supersolvable Lie algebra is an\nextension of a Lie algebra which is not lm\u00f00\u00de by an lm\u00f00\u00de-algebra.\nProof. Let L be strongly solvable but not supersolvable. By Corollary 3.3(ii), we\nhave that S\u00f0L\u00deL is lm(0). By Corollary 4.3, we have that L=S\u00f0L\u00deL is not lm(0).\nNotice that Corollary 4.4 fails for solvable Lie algebras over fields of prime char-\nacteristic. Indeed, we will see that there are solvable non-supersolvable Lie algebras L\nsuch that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc L. So, by Corollary 3.3(ii), every homomorphic image of such an L\nis lm(0).\nNext we want to consider solvable lm(0)-algebras L which are not supersolvable.\nIn the case where L is strongly solvable, it follows from Proposition 4.2 that such an\nL must have non-trivial Frattini subalgebra. We will determine the lm(0)-algebras in\nthe class of solvable, non-supersolvable Lie algebras all of whose proper subalgebras\nare supersolvable (called minimal non-supersolvable for short). The algebras L in\nthis class are determined in Elduque and Varea (1986). In the case where L0 is not\nnilpotent, there it is proved that ad x is split for every x 2 L, so that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc L. Then,\nLie Algebras Whose Minimal Subalgebras Are Lower Modular 11\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nby Corollary 3.3(ii), L=N is lm(0) for every ideal N of L. In the case where L0 is\nnilpotent, we see that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc f\u00f0L\u00de. It follows that L=f\u00f0L\u00de is not lm(0), by\nCorollary 4.3. However, we see that L is lm(0) whenever f\u00f0L\u00de 6\u00bc 0. Therefore we\nhave the following:\nProposition 4.5. Let F be an arbitrary field. For a solvable, minimal non-super-\nsolvable Lie algebra L, the following are equivalent:\n(i) L is NOT lm\u00f00\u00de.\n(ii) L is strongly solvable and f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0.\n(iii) L has a basis e1; . . . ; er , x with non-trivial product given by \u00bdei; x\u0003 \u00bc ei\u00fe1,\nfor every 1 \u0001 i < r and \u00bder ; x\u0003 \u00bc c0e1 \u00fe \t \t \t \u00fe cr\u00021er , where the polynomial\nlr \u0002 cr\u00021lr\u00021 \u0002 \t \t \t \u0002 c0 is irreducible in F\u00bdl\u0003 and r > 1.\nNote that the minimal non-supersolvable Lie algebras with non-nilpotent\nderived subalgebra and with trivial Frattini subalgebra are examples of solvable\nlm(0)-algebras having no minimal ideals of dimension one.\n5. NON-SOLVABLE lm(0)-ALGEBRAS OF\nCHARACTERISTIC ZERO\nIn this section F is assumed to be of characteristic zero. First we see that the\nproblem of the classification of lm(0)-algebras is reduced in some sense to the\nclassification of solvable lm(0)-algebras.\nTheorem 5.1. Let L be a nonsolvable Lie algebra. Then the following hold:\n(i) If\nffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F , then L is lm\u00f00\u00de if and only if every solvable subalgebra of L is\nlm\u00f00\u00de.\n(ii) If\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F , then L is lm\u00f00\u00de if and only if every solvable subalgebra of L is\nlm\u00f00\u00de and L has no subalgebras isomorphic to sl\u00f02\u00de.\nProof. We prove (i) and (ii) together. As the class of lm(0)-algebras is closed by\nsubalgebras, it suffices to prove the \u2018\u2018only if \u2019\u2019 part. Let L be a counterexample of\nminimal dimension. Then we see that L is minimal non-lm(0). By Corollary 3.7(ii),\nit follows that L 62 Y. By Lemma 3.6(ii), we have that either L is solvable or\nL ffi sl\u00f02\u00de and ffiffiffiFp 6\u0001 F , which is a contradiction.\nA Lie algebra L is said to be anisotropic if it has no nonzero ad-nilpotent\nelements. A Lie algebra L is called ad-semisimple if ad x is semisimple for every\nx 2 L. Note that if L is ad-semisimple, then L=Z\u00f0L\u00de is semisimple. It is known that\nfor perfect fields a Lie algebra L is anisotropic if and only if it is ad-semisimple. It is\neasy to see and well-known that if L is ad-semisimple, then zero is the only eigen-\nvalue of ad x for every x 2 L and that every solvable subalgebra of L is abelian\n(see Farnsteiner 1983). From Theorem 5.1, it follows that every ad-semisimple Lie\nalgebra is lm(0).\n12 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nNext, we study semisimple Lie algebras which are lm(0). In the case whereffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F , we have the following.\nCorollary 5.2. Let\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F . Then, a semisimple Lie algebra L is lm\u00f00\u00de if and only\nif it is anisotropic.\nProof. Assume that L is lm(0). As\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F , the Lie algebra sl\u00f02\u00de is not lm(0). So,\nL cannot contain any subalgebra isomorphic to sl\u00f02\u00de. This yields that L has no\nnonzero ad-nilpotent element; since otherwise, such an element would be immersed\nin a subalgebra of L isomorphic to sl\u00f02\u00de, according to Theorem 17, p. 100 of\nJacobson (1979), which is a contradiction. This gives that L is anisotropic. The\nconverse follows from Theorem 5.1.\nCorollary 5.2 covers the case where the ground field F is the real number field.\nWe recall that a real semisimple Lie algebra is anisotropic if and only if it is compact\n(that is, its Killing bilinear form is negative definite). So that, the only real semisimple\nLie algebras which are lm(0) are the compact ones.\nOur next task is to study lm(0) algebras which are neither solvable nor semi-\nsimple. We see that lm(0)-algebras with abelian solvable radical, as well as Lie\nalgebras all of whose solvable subalgebras are supersolvable (for short,M-algebras),\nsatisfy the condition assumed in Corollary 2.5. We will see that the classes lm(0) and\nM are closely related. Now we obtain the following:\nTheorem 5.3. Let L be a Lie algebra. Then the following hold:\n(i) If L 2M, then L is a direct sum of a completely split Lie algebra and a\ncompletely non-split semisimple Lie algebra.\nNow assume in addition that R\u00f0L\u00de is abelian. Then\n(ii) If\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F , L is lm\u00f00\u00de if and only if L is a direct sum of an abelian Lie\nalgebra and an anisotropic semisimple Lie algebra; and\n(iii) If\nffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F , L is lm\u00f00\u00de if and only if L is a direct sum of a completely split\nLie algebra and a completely non-split, semisimple lm\u00f00\u00de-algebra.\nProof. (i) Assume L 2M. We claim that R\u00f0L\u00de \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de. To see this, let x 2 L.\nSince the subalgebra R\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe Fx is solvable, by our hypothesis it is supersolvable.\nThis yields that ad\u00f0x\u00dejR\u00f0L\u00de is split and therefore R\u00f0L\u00de \u0001 SL\u00f0x\u00de. Hence,\nR\u00f0L\u00de \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de, as claimed. Then the result follows from Corollary 2.5. Assertions\n(ii) and (iii) follow from Theorem 3.8 and Corollaries 5.2 and 2.5.\nCorollary 5.4. Let\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F . Let L be a Lie algebra such that R\u00f0L\u00de is supersolvable.\nThen, the following hold:\n(i) L0 2M()L 2M.\n(ii) if L0 is lm\u00f00\u00de and if R\u00f0L0\u00de is abelian, then L is lm\u00f00\u00de.\nProof. (i) Assume L0 2M. Then, R\u00f0L0\u00de \u0001 S\u00f0L0\u00de (see the proof of Theorem 5.3).\nLet L \u00bc R\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe T be a Levi decomposition of L. We see L0 \u00bc R\u00f0L0\u00de \u00fe T . Asffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F , we have S\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc 0. Then, by Theorem 2.4, it follows that \u00bdR\u00f0L0\u00de;T\u0003 \u00bc 0,\nLie Algebras Whose Minimal Subalgebras Are Lower Modular 13\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nwhence T is an ideal of L0. This gives that T is the only Levi subalgebra of L0.\nSince every Levi subalgebra of L must be contained in L0, we see that T is the only\nLevi subalgebra of L. Hence T \/ L and L \u00bc R\u00f0L\u00de \u0004 T . Now, let B be a maximal\nsolvable subalgebra of L. We see that B \u00bc R\u00f0L\u00de \u0004 \u00f0B \\ T\u00de. Since B \\ T is a solvable\nsubalgebra of L0, it is supersolvable. This yields that B is supersolvable too and hence\nL 2M. The converse is clear.\n(ii) Assume L0 is lm\u00f00\u00de and R\u00f0L0\u00de is abelian. By Theorem 5.3, we have\nL0 \u00bc A\u0004 B, where A is an abelian ideal of L0 and B is an anisotropic\nsemisimple ideal of L0. We see that B is the only Levi subalgebra of L and so\nL \u00bc R\u00f0L\u00de \u0004 B. As R\u00f0L\u00de and B are both lm\u00f00\u00de, it follows from Proposition 3.11 that\nL is lm\u00f00\u00de.\nCorollary 5.5.

This follows from Theorem 5.1, Corollary 5.2, and from the fact that sl\u00f02\u00de is\nin M, but it is not lm(0) whenever\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F .\n6. LIE ALGEBRAS ALL OF WHOSE PROPER HOMOMORPHIC\nIMAGES ARE lm(0)\nIn this section, by using previous results in this paper, we are able to determine\nthe Lie algebras all of whose proper homomorphic images are lm\u00f00\u00de, which will be\ncalled Q\u0002 lm\u00f00\u00de for short. A Lie algebra all of whose proper homomorphic images\nare supersolvable will be called Q-supersolvable.\nWe start by considering solvable Lie algebras over arbitrary fields.\nTheorem 6.1. Let F be an arbitrary field. Let L be solvable. Then the following\nhold:\n(i) Every homomorphic image of L is lm\u00f00\u00de if and only if L is completely\nsplit; and\n(ii) If L is strongly solvable, then L is Q\u0002 lm\u00f00\u00de if and only if L is Q-\nsupersolvable.\nProof. (i) This follows from Corollary 3.9 and Corollary 3.3(ii).\n(ii) Assume that L is strongly solvable and Q-lm\u00f00\u00de. Let us first suppose that\nf\u00f0L\u00de 6\u00bc 0. Then we have that L=f\u00f0L\u00de is lm\u00f00\u00de and f-free. So, by Proposition 4.2,\nit follows that L=f\u00f0L\u00de is supersolvable. Then, by Theorem 6 of Barnes (1967), we\nhave that L is supersolvable. Now assume that f\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0. Then we have that L=N\nis lm\u00f00\u00de and f-free for every proper ideal N of L. It follows from Proposition 4.2\nagain that every proper homomorphic image of L is supersolvable. Thus L is\nQ-supersolvable, as required. The converse is clear.\nSolvable, Q-supersolvable Lie algebras were studied by Towers (1985). He\nproved that such a Lie algebra L must have the following form: L \u00bc N\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe U ,\n14 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nN\u00f0L\u00de \\ U \u00bc 0, where N\u00f0L\u00de is the unique minimal ideal of L, \u00bdu;N\u00f0L\u00de\u0003 \u00bc N\u00f0L\u00de for\nsome u 2 U , and U is a supersolvable maximal subalgebra of L.\nNext we classify the nonsolvable Lie algebras all of whose homomorphic images\nare lm\u00f00\u00de. To do that we need the assumption of characteristic zero for the ground\nfield.\nTheorem 6.2. Let char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0. For a nonsolvable Lie algebra L, the following are\nequivalent:\n(i) Every homomorphic image of L is lm\u00f00\u00de.\n(ii) L and L=S\u00f0L\u00de are both lm\u00f00\u00de; and\n(iii) Either\nffiffiffi\nF\np 6\u0001 F and L \u00bc U \u0004 T where U is a supersolvable ideal of L and\nT is an anisotropic semisimple ideal of L, or else\nffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F and L is\nisomorphic to a direct sum of a completely split Lie algebra and a\ncompletely non-split, semisimple lm\u00f00\u00de-algebra.\nProof. (i)\u00bc) (ii) is trivial.\n(ii)\u00bc) (iii) Let L \u00bc R\u00f0L\u00de \u00fe T be a Levi decomposition of L. As L is non-\nsolvable, T 6\u00bc 0. As L=S\u00f0L\u00de is lm\u00f00\u00de, by using Corollary 3.9 we obtain that either\nL is completely split, or else L=S\u00f0L\u00de is semisimple. In the former case, we haveffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F because S\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc T , and we are done. So assume L=S\u00f0L\u00de is semisimple. This\nimplies that R\u00f0L\u00de \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de, since S\u00f0L\u00de is an ideal of L. Then the result follows from\nCorollary 2.5.\n(iii)\u00bc) \u00f0i\u00de Let N \/ L. Then we see that L=N is a direct sum of two lm\u00f00\u00de ideals.\nBy Proposition 3.11, it follows that L=N is lm\u00f00\u00de.\nCorollary 6.3. Let char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 0. For a non-solvable, non-semisimple and non-lm\u00f00\u00de\nLie algebra L, the following are equivalent:\n(i) L is Q\u0002 lm\u00f00\u00de.\n(ii) S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0, L has a unique minimal ideal A that is abelian and L=A has the\nstructure given in Theorem 6.2(iii).\nProof. \u00f0i\u00de\u00bc) \u00f0ii\u00de By Proposition 3.11, it follows that L has only one minimal\nideal A. As R\u00f0L\u00de 6\u00bc 0, we have A \u0001 R\u00f0L\u00de and so A is abelian. Now we prove that\nS\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0. Suppose S\u00f0L\u00de 6\u00bc 0. Then L=S\u00f0L\u00de is lm\u00f00\u00de. By Corollary 3.9 it follows that\nL=S\u00f0L\u00de is semisimple. This yields R\u00f0L\u00de \u0001 S\u00f0L\u00de. Then by Corollary 2.5 it follows\nthat L \u00bc S\u00f0L\u00de \u0004 K, where K is a semisimple ideal of L. As A is the unique minimal\nideal of L, we have K \u00bc 0. This yields that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc L and hence L is lm\u00f00\u00de. This\ncontradiction shows that S\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0. The last statement follows from Theorem 6.2,\nsince every homomorphic image of L=A is lm\u00f00\u00de.\n(ii)\u00bc) (i) By Theorem 6.2, we have that every homomorphic image of L=A is\nlm\u00f00\u00de. As A is the unique minimal ideal of L, it follows that L is Q-lm\u00f00\u00de. Since\nS\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0 and L has abelian minimal ideals, from Theorem 3.8 it follows that L is\nnot lm\u00f00\u00de.\nLie Algebras Whose Minimal Subalgebras Are Lower Modular 15\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\n7. ON lm(0)-ALGEBRAS OVER FIELDS OF\nPRIME CHARACTERISTIC\nFirst, we consider ad-semisimple Lie algebras over perfect fields of characteristic\ngreater than three. Before that we need the following lemma:\nLemma 7.1. Let F be perfect and char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc p > 3. Let L be ad-semisimple without\ncenter. Then L0 has no non-singular derivations.\nProof. Since L=L00 is ad-semisimple and solvable, we have that it is abelian (see\nFarnsteiner, 1983). Therefore L0 \u00bc L00. Then, by using Theorem 3 and Corollary 2\nof Premet (1987), we obtain that L0 \u0005O F is a direct sum of simple ideals which\nare of classical type. In particular, we have that L0 \u0005O F is restricted and without\ncenter. This yields that every derivation of L0 \u0005O F is restricted, see Seligman\n(1967). By Jacobson (1955), it follows that L0 \u0005O F has no non-singular derivation,\nand so neither has L0.\nProposition 7.2. Let F be perfect and char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc p > 3. Then, every ad-semisimple\nLie algebra is lm\u00f00\u00de.\nProof. Let L be a minimal counterexample. Then, we have that every proper\nsubalgebra of L is lm\u00f00\u00de. By Corollary 2.9 (i) it follows that L 62 Y. So, either\nL \u00bc L0 \u00fe Fx with x acting irreducibly on L0 and dimL0 > 1 or L is simple of rank\none having subalgebras of dimension greater than one (Lemma 3.6(i)). In the former\ncase we see that Z\u00f0L\u00de \u00bc 0 and adx j L0 is a non-singular derivation of L0. This contra-\ndicts Lemma 7.1. Therefore L is simple of rank one. By using Theorem 3 and\nCorollary 2 of Premet (1987), we obtain that LO is a direct sum of simple ideals of\nclassical type. This yields LO ffi sl\u00f02\u00de. Therefore dimL \u00bc 3. Finally, since L is\nad-semisimple, it follows that every proper subalgebra of L has dimension one. This\ncontradiction completes the proof.\nNext, we consider Lie algebras L having a maximal subalgebra L0 of codimen-\nsion one which does not contain any proper ideal of L. We recall that such a Lie alge-\nbra L must be isomorphic to one of the Lie algebras Ln\u00f0G\u00de constructed by Amayo\n(1976). Assume char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc p > 2 and let G \u00bc fg0; g1; . . . ; gn\u00021g \b F . Then, the Lie\nalgebra Ln\u00f0G\u00de can be defined by having a basis y\u00021, y0, y1; . . . ; ypn\u00022 with product\ngiven by \u00bdy\u00021; yi\u0003 \u00bc yi\u00021 for 0 \u0001 i \u0001 pn\u00022 except when i \u00bc pj\u00021 for some j,\n\u00bdy\u00021; ypj\u00021 \u0003 \u00bc ypj\u00022 \u00fe gjypn\u00022 and \u00bdyi; yj\u0003 \u00bc aijyi\u00fej for 0 \u0001 i; j \u0001 pn\u00022, where\naij \u00bc i\u00fe j \u00fe 1\nj\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002 i\u00fe j \u00fe 1\ni\n\u0002 \u0003\n;\nand where we follow the convention that the binomial coefficient\nr\ns\n\u0004 \u0005\n\u00bc 0 unless\n0 \u0001 s \u0001 r. We mention that Ln\u00f0f0g\u00de is the Zassenhaus algebra Zn\u00f0F\u00de and that\nL1\u00f0f0g\u00de is the Witt algebra over F .\nLet char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc p > 2. We recall that a polynomial f 2 F\u00bdX\u0003 is called a p-\npolynomial if the only powers of X having nonzero coefficients in f are of the form\n16 Bowman, Towers, and Varea\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nXp\ni\nfor i \n 0. For n > 0, we say that the field F has p- index greater than or equal to\nn (written indp\u00f0F\u00de \n n) if every p-polynomial f of degree less than or equal to pn\nwithout multiple roots in an algebraic closure of F , has a non-zero root in F . We\nsay that indp\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc n if indp\u00f0F\u00de \n n but indp\u00f0F\u00de 6\n n\u00fe 1. Finally, indp\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc 1 if\nevery p-polynomial of degree greater than zero without multiple roots in an\nalgebraic closure of F , has nonzero roots in F .\nTheorem 7.3. Let char\u00f0F\u00de \u00bc p > 2. Let n be a positive integer. Then, the following\nare equivalent.\n(i) Lm\u00f0G\u00de is lm\u00f00\u00de for every G and m \u0001 n.\n(ii) indp\u00f0F\u00de \n n and\nffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F .\nProof. (i) \u00bc) (ii) Note that the span of y\u00021, y0 and y1 in Zn\u00f0F\u00de is a subalgebra of\nZn\u00f0F\u00de which is isomorphic to sl\u00f02\u00de. This yields that sl\u00f02\u00de is lm(0) and hence\nffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F .\nNow, let f be a monic p-polynomial over F of degree \u0001n without multiple roots in\nan algebraic closure of F . So that, f has the form\nf\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc Xpm \u00fe bm\u00021Xp\nm\u00021 \u00fe \t \t \t \u00fe b0X;\nwhere b0 6\u00bc 0 and m \u0001 n. Put G \u00bc f\u0002b0; . . . ;\u0002bm\u00021g. We see that the minimum\npolynomial of ady\u00021 is equal to f\u00f0X\u00de, where y\u00021 is the first vector in a standard\nbasis for Lm\u00f0G\u00de. This algebra is lm\u00f00\u00de, by our hypothesis. Take a subalgebra\nU of Lm\u00f0G\u00de containing Fy\u00021 and such that Fy\u00021 is maximal in U . We see\ndimU=\u00f0U \\ Lm\u00f0G\u00de0\u00de \u00bc 1. By Proposition 3.1 it follows that dimU \\ Lm\u00f0G\u00de0 \u00bc 1.\nThis yields dimU \u00bc 2. On the other hand, we see that y\u00021 is self-centralizing in\nLm\u00f0G\u00de and that it is not ad-nilpotent. It follows that ad\u00f0y\u00021\u00de j U has a nonzero\neigenvalue in F . Therefore f\u00f0X\u00de has a nonzero root in F .\n(ii) \u00bc) (i) Letm \u0001 n. Suppose thatLm\u00f0G\u00de is not lm\u00f00\u00de. Then, by Proposition 3.1,\nthere exists a subalgebra U of Lm\u00f0G\u00de which has a maximal subalgebra of dimension\none, say Fu, and a maximal subalgebra of dimension greater than one. As U is not\nlm\u00f00\u00de and since Lm\u00f0G\u00de0 is supersolvable (see Lemma 2.1 of Varea, 1988), we have\nU 6\u0001 Lm\u00f0G\u00de0. Then the subalgebra U \\ Lm\u00f0G\u00de0 of U has codimension one in U .\nMoreover, U \\ Lm\u00f0G\u00de0 contains no nonzero ideals of U (see the proof of Lemma\n3.7 of Benkart et al., 1979). This yields that U is simple. Thus U is central simple,\nsince Fu is maximal in U . Therefore, U \u0005F O is a simple Lie algebra over O having\na maximal subalgebra of codimension one, where O is an algebraic closure of F . By\nTheorem 3.9 of Benkart et al. (1979), it follows that either U \u0005F O ffi sl\u00f02;O\u00de or\nelse U \u0005F O ffi Zr\u00f0O\u00de for some r \u0001 m. In the former case, we have that U is\nthree-dimensional simple. So, U ffi sl\u00f02;F\u00de since U has a maximal subalgebra of\ndimension greater than one. Since\nffiffiffi\nF\np \u0001 F , we find that the algebra sl\u00f02;F\u00de has\nno maximal subalgebras of dimension one, and so neither has U , which is a\ncontradiction. Therefore, U \u0005F O is a Zassenhaus algebra. By using Theorem 6.1\nof Benkart et al. (1979), we get that the characteristic polynomial of adU\u00f0u\u00de is\nequal to the minimum polynomial and has the form\nm\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc Xpr \u00fe ar\u00021Xpr\u00021 \u00fe \t \t \t \u00fe a1Xp \u00fe a0X:\nLie Algebras Whose Minimal Subalgebras Are Lower Modular 17\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n200036762_LAGB32_12_R2_091304\nSince Fu is a Cartan subalgebra of U , we have a0 6\u00bc 0, so that, m\u00f0X\u00de has no multiple\nroots in O. Then, by our hypothesis, m\u00f0X\u00de has a nonzero root t in F . Therefore, there\nexists 0 6\u00bc y 2 U such that Fu 6\u00bc Fy and \u00bdu; y\u0003 \u00bc ty.

Note that, for each n we have Ln\u00f0G\u00de ffi Zn\u00f0F\u00de for every G, since F is perfect\nand char\u00f0F\u00de > 3 (see Corollary 2.3 of Varea, 1988). Also, note that if m < n, then\nZm\u00f0F\u00de is isomorphic to a subalgebra of Zn\u00f0F\u00de. So, if Zn\u00f0F\u00de is lm\u00f00\u00de, so is Zm\u00f0F\u00de\nfor every m < n. The result follows from these notes and Theorem 7.3.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are grateful to the referee for his=her suggestions.
