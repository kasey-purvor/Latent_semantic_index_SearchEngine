He has Chaired many major FTSE companies through transformation and significant\nshareholder value creation at Babcock International, RMC Group, P&O and the Lattice Group.\nIn addition, he has served on a raft of companies as a Non Executive Director for well over 20\nyears.\nWhat has influenced you?\nI trained as a naval architect and engineer and my mathematical background has helped give\nme a sense of proportion. I suppose too I'm pretty numerate. I think that's important in\nbusiness because at the end of the day you have to put dimensions on issues and you have\nto make judgements based on such facts. The engineering mind is quite a disciplined mind.\nTry to get the decimal point in the right place if you can \u2013 that's a very important bit of\nbusiness!\nWhat then of Chairmanship?\nI have some key golden rules that I apply when I'm actually structuring my role as a new\nChairman. It starts by debating what is to be the management philosophy of this company\nand its Board going forward. You then spend time thrashing this out with your Chief\nExecutive. Particularly, when two organisations are brought together in a merger or major\nacquisition, then you really have to stop and say, what is our philosophy for managing this\none enterprise?\nIt is the principles that emerge from such debate that guide me \u2013 but they inevitably start by\ninstalling leading governance practices beyond compliance. So when Higgs came along, we\nat National Grid, for example, had virtually nothing to change. We were completely compliant!\nSecond, we inevitably decide we are to have decentralised operational management\ndecision-making within agreed delegated authorities and well defined responsibilities. Third,\nwhatever the structure, strong central financial controls, that penetrate all the way down the\norganisation, are essential and there has to be that dotted line, independent financial\nreporting relationship right through to the Boardroom. But, as one of my friends has put it, \u201cnot\ntoo much space between the dots\u201d! And fourthly, and particularly relevant in the world we live\nin, sound administration. By that I mean the good documentation of how we do things via our\npolicies and procedures including the documentation of authorities and responsibilities. Keep\nthe documentation as simple and streamlined as possible and disseminated widely on the\nweb, so that people working in any role know precisely what their authority is and they know\nhow to get \u201csign off\u201d. Well documented records of decisions and the advice taken by a Board\nare also critical in today's Boardroom.\nThe same applies to Board committee structures, membership, terms of reference and then\nsomething not often talked about is high level Board and committee interactions. The key\nresponsibility for ensuring a good interface between the committees, which is done outside\nthe Boardroom to make sure nothing drops between the floorboards. This is what I call\n\u201cjoined-up governance\u201d part of Board administration This explains why the role of the\nCompany Secretary and the General Council has grown in important over recent years.\nIs clearly structuring the organisation and roles the way to lead people?\nIt's only the first step. Next is to empower the Executive to be creative, to constantly exercise\nhow to create value. The Executive have to have a clear vision of the future and the Non\nExecutive Directors need to have a large breadth of skills in the Boardroom that can\nchallenge and debate to add value, and minimise risk. At every Board meeting we devote\ntime to strategic debate but the first Agenda item is Safety, Health and the Environment.\nWhat's the nature of our business model and where are you trying to take this model? I\nalways say to the Executive, you should keep the Board \u201cwarmed up\u201d about where you're\ntrying to take the business \u2013 minimise the surprises and be consistent in strategic direction\nand focus.\nHow important is debate between the CEO and the Chair?\nA very important stage in setting up a new Board is defining the role of the Chairman and that\nof the Chief Executive. It is critical to get that right. I think the role of the Chairman, in its\nsimplest form, is leading the Board, managing governance and oversight of strategy. The\nChief Executive, with his team, is responsible for managing the business day by day and for\nformulating and executing strategy for subsequent Boardroom debate. Strategic direction is a\nkey matter for the whole Board. The Chairman should really be the CEO's mentor, his\nsounding Board, the guy that the Chief Executive will naturally turn to discuss things. For the\nChief Executive here at National Grid, I have a formal slot every week with him. Beyond that\nwe will wander in and out of each other's office if there's something on either of our minds.\nInformal debate is highly valuable and something I think should be encouraged in the\nCEO\/Chairman relationship. The CEO goes back to the Executive with some of my views and\nI to the Non Executive Directors with his. The Chairman is the bridge between the Executive\nand the Board as a whole.\nIs it important to define the roles of Chairman and CEO or are they, by nature, self-\nevident?\nNo, one of the good things to come out of the Higgs Review is the requirement to set down\nand define the role of the Chairman, and the role of the Chief Executive and debate that at the\nBoard. At National Grid we had already done that in advance of Higgs. It was a prerequisite of\nthe merger because I had been Acting Chief Executive of the other Group, and suddenly I\nwas the Chairman dealing with the new CEO who was the guy with whom I had negotiated! I\nbelieve it's important to write down duties and responsibilities.\nHow does the Chairman add value?\nThe Chairman can ensure there is a disciplined framework in the Boardroom for conducting\nbusiness. That leads in time to having a clear discipline right through the organisation. People\nknowing exactly where they stand and what the processes for key decisions are. I don't like to\nsee people running around like headless chickens fighting for their corner. So the discipline\nthat emanates from the Boardroom, the drumbeat that you set from the Boardroom is a very,\npowerful influence on the organisation as a whole. Here at National Grid, we also as a Board\nhave a significant interplay with and knowledge of the next layer of management.\nThe value that the Chairman and Chief Executive can both add is to organise the Board visits,\netc. in such a way that a dynamic relationship exists between the people who are just below\nthe Board and also are not only key managers but the future talent bank.\nAlso, getting to know the team of people is fundamental in the succession planning process\ndiscussed at the Board. Unless you know people, it's a pretty meaningless discussion. People\nput up names and say this guy was at Cambridge and he's done five years here and five\nyears there. What about and his\/her personality? What about emotional intelligence and\nhis\/her fit with other people? How good is he\/she at managing across functions? I haven't a\nclue unless I know him\/her. The Board members haven't a clue and so they can't add value\nunless there are opportunities to meet and see people in action. Adding value on the people\nfront is vitally important. Setting up a disciplined framework is critical to the smooth and safe\nrunning of the business and for the development of key people.\nWhat makes the Chair\/CEO relationship work?\nIt has to be based on professionalism and care and concern for the success of the business\nbeing more dominant that the personalities. Equally, it doesn't need to be too formal. I shake\nthe hand of every executive that comes into my office. It's a small thing but when I came here\nwe did not normally do this. So, every time the Chief Executive comes through my door, the\nhand's out. Shake hands, sit down and then relax. The signal is, we're in this together! We're\nprofessionals. It's not about both of us having to go out together regularly and socialise at\nRugby or over regular dinners. I don't generally do that. As it is, we go out to dinner with the\nwhole Board once a month. We often have a presentation before dinner especially if we have\na tough subject the next day. We invite the Executive or the management to come in for that.\nThey will join us for dinner \u2013 the buzz is really good. If we have an awkward subject, then over\nthe main course, we'll open up the debate. I'll ask the CEO where are the Executive on this?\nSometimes we have quite heated debates. But next day at the Board, what looked before like\na mountain of an issue, you've eaten two-thirds of it.\nCan informality get in the way of assessing the performance of the CEO?\nYes it can. I've had situations where the Chief Executive is not doing what he should. He's not\ndelivering what the Board asked him to do. And that's where the Chairman has to act. I say\nwe committed to deliver on this, so I and the Board expect to see progress. Then you find that\nexcuses are being made. But the moment you sit the Chief Executive down, especially if you\nhave a relaxed but grown up relationship, then you really must come out of your box and\nconfront him\/her. I say, \u201cthe reality is you are not delivering. You're going to have to get your\nskates on because I expect the Non execs at next month's Board are really going to be very\nchallenging. Some of them have already been on to me.\u201d In that sense I'm the bridge between\nthe Board and the CEO. I'm also the conduit for the Non Executive Directors to express their\npersonal views. The Chairman must keep lines of communication open with the Non\nExecutive cadre. That bridge is quite important. But the Chairman must deliver the message,\nhowever difficult.\nDo you have Non Executives who hold a specialist functional role?\nYes, we do! And they \u201cbuddy\u201d with the appropriate executive!\nThis comes again down to a discipline framework. Apart from the Nominations Committee\nwhich I Chair, all other Non Executive Director's interface with the appropriate Executive\nDirector. The leader of the Audit Committee is a Finance Director from a FTSE company. He\nwill interface with the Auditors. He will interface with the Finance Director and the Internal\nAuditor and go meet them, off line, if there's something that concerns him. He will not\nnecessarily talk to me about it. He doesn't have to. I don't require it. If it were a major issue, I\nwould expect, via the CEO and Financial Director, to know and be well informed of it. The\nChairmen of the committees of the Board invite the appropriate management to attend and\nthe duties of committees are well spelt out including that of interfacing with each other. All this\nensures that the Board has ultimate transparency via reports on risks and compliance,\nintegrity of management systems, health and safety, the environment, CSR, internal and\nexternal audit, human resources, legal company secretary issues, financing issues, etc.\nChairmen need to ensure the processes are in place to ensure so far as is humanly possible\nfor complete transparency on the company and its operations.\nHow many Executives sit on the Board?\nWe have six, the Chief Executive, Finance Director and four Divisional Heads. This is\nmatched by six Non Executives and the Chairman, 13 plus the Company Secretary and\nGeneral Council. The Company Secretary and General Council is not a Board member but in\ntoday's world of high expectation on governance, a very important person, particularly in the\nSarbanes-Oxley era. The amount of documentation that we have to write up and go through\nis just enormous. We will see greater emphasis on the role of the General Council, Company\nSecretary on Boards in the next decade.\nWill Sarbanes-Oxley really make a contribution?\nThis is the question we all keep asking when we hear of the significant, extra costs of the\nAudit. We have a very large project team working on it at National Grid. Our estimate running\ndown on the whole programme we're embarked is some \u00a310 million extra. Every year we\nhave got to walk through every single IT system and then test it against \u201cwhat ifs\u201d. If you find\nany error, we have to correct it and then re-test everything again. It's an iterative process,\nwhich means we cannot at any point in the programme define the total resource required or\nthe timescale to complete. So even in the last weeks of the audit, you still may not fully know\nthat we are going to be able to tick all the boxes. Auditors cannot now leave any loose ends.\nWhen you sign off, you've got to sign off and leave no loose ends. This is producing\nenormous pressure on Auditors as well as on us. But, Auditors are short of the right resources\nand clearly have Lawyers sitting on every key decision. It can be rather paralyzing. I think the\nentrepreneurial spirit is being dampened. So, what are the benefits? And I keep pressing;\ncome on \u2013 there must be benefits! Probably being forced to better document the systems and\nbeing forced to introduce more rigour and discipline. Being forced to sign off and certify this is\na true and correct record at various micro levels probably gives a few extra hours sleep at\nnight. In my view, the US has used knee jerk legislation that now needs refining.\nHow to become a good Chairman?\nThe best Chairmen I've ever had when I was a CEO were strong, who knew what they\nwanted to do in their Boardrooms. What makes a good Chairman? In my view one can't\nbecome a good Chairman unless the individual has done a good apprenticeship as a Non\nExecutive Director. You occupy the same Boardroom but you occupy a different space in the\nBoardroom from the Executive. I judge a Non Executive's effectiveness by \u2013 does he\/she\ninfluence events? Does he\/she influence strategy? Does he\/she influence the behaviour and\nresponse of the Executive? I consider one of the best development opportunities of my life\nhas been to serve in other Boardrooms as a Non Executive Director which I have now been\ndoing for some 23 years. I learnt more there than in any business school! And the reason is\nvery straightforward. It is a live, dynamic, real experience and you are forced to learn about\nthe creation of value in a company. You are forced to engage in a strategic debate that's not\nall academic debate. Now, not everybody can have that experience so that's why we have\ngood business schools and there should be a closer interrelationship between us all, in the\neducation of good management. So I believe to be a successful Chairman, you have to learn\nfrom others and learn from Boardroom colleagues especially in Chairing important\ncommittees of the Board. You can learn from excellent companies as well as companies\ngoing through a lot of challenge, e.g. I learnt a lot from the British Coal Corporation which was\na nationalised company. They had management development formalised in a way I'd never\nseen in the private sector. They had their own Management Training College. I used to go\nand lecture there and meet all these guys from all over the UK. They really invested in their\npeople in a way that we at that time didn't in the private sector. One can learn in all sorts of\nplaces and in unexpected ways.\nA particularly sensitive issue for the Chairman is executive remuneration! What is your\napproach?\nFirst of all, I believe in keeping an oversight and join the debate about the overall framework\nand philosophy of compensation but you must leave it to the Remuneration Chairman and the\nindependent Directors to determine the remuneration profile for each Executive Director. I sit\nin on all of the Remuneration Committee meetings because it's clearly an important part of\ncorporate life. I start from the simple principle that quality people in the Boardroom make the\ndifference. That applies to the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors. It certainly applies\nto the Chief Executive and the Executive team. I believe that you should reward well for\nperformance, in line with your peer group and you should reward very well for outstanding\nperformance. Reward, however, should not be excessive, nor should there be award for\nfailures. The other point I make is that I'm suspicious of complex formulas by which awards\nare arrived at. I think there has been, over the last decade, considerable complexity injected\nvia remuneration consultants that some Remuneration Committees have bought into. The\nmore complexity there is, the less visibility there is to shareholders and, indeed, to company\nmanagement as to how their Directors are rewarded, whereas if it's straightforward, let us say\nearnings per share or TSR, the situation improves. TSR is of itself not the easiest thing to\nexplain internally in a company because it's not something individual managers can work out\nevery day of the week. Earnings per share (EPS) is something you can see every quarter,\nreturn on capital measured on a consistent basis is as well. I have to say after so many years\nin Boardrooms that in reality there is no perfect system of measurement. But taken over time,\nI feel that tangible measurements, like earnings per share, will for most companies be an\nimportant, consistent measure of shareholder value creation coupled with TSR.\nWhat of the intangibles? The culture the Chief Executive has created? The redesign of\nthe organisation? All of which will not show earnings per share type of returns until,\nlet's say, 20 months from now. How do you reward critical intangibles?\nWell I think you do have an element of your annual bonus that is based on personal targets.\nSo there is a performance element that's probably 70-75 percent, and 20-25 percent would be\nthe personal issues or strategic building blocks that you want to see put in place to support,\nfuture years' earnings growth. It is important that these personal targets should be\nmeasurable and well-defined.\nWhat then of the options scandal that has been plaguing the USA? Something like 580\ncompanies are under investigation for backdating stock options!\nIt comes back to one of my four pillars in the Boardroom. You need sound administration, and\na strong General Counsel with a good Corporate Secretariat They would not allow that sort of\nthing to happen \u2013 they would and should scream! I just cannot imagine it happening here\nbecause we as a Board, receive a regular report from the Corporate Secretary on all\nadministration with regard to share issues. All stock issues are approved by the\nRemuneration Committee, in the hands of independent Directors with the General Counsel\nadvice available. She, in our case, would administer that under a disciplined administrative\nsystem.\nIf you were to offer advice to a newly appointed Chairman on best practice\nremuneration, what advice would you give?\nSelect wisely the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and put in place sound administration\nfor the management of the Committee and ensure good, professional support from your HR\nDirector. I think if you get those three things reasonably aligned you can filter out most of the\nrubbish.\nDo the execs and non execs share a similar view on creating value for National Grid?\nWe encourage real debate in the Boardroom and amongst Executive and Senior Managers.\nThe top sixty managers in the US and UK had a strategic debate with the Executive in the\nAutumn at their Annual Conference. They were all buzzing. \u201cWe had a real dynamic debate\ntoday about strategy\u201d. I said, \u201cWell I hope you've influenced it.\u201d We gave the Executive quite a\ntough time. I think that is how you open up the oyster, how you engage with the next layer of\nmanagement. One of the elements of that debate was how do we actually measure success?\nIs it growth in EPS over five years and\/or is it total shareholder return? And if it's total\nshareholder return who really are your peer group? National Grid is, in my view, largely about\ncash generation and EPS growth.\nMany non-execs tell us, they don't quite know how to add value. How have you\nmanaged to have the Board of National Grid to clearly add value?\nIt comes back to the debate on the clarity of the strategic objectives, the aims of the business\nand the consistency focus on a well-defined business model. If suddenly the Board receives a\npaper that says we're going to open up the Indian market, or we're going to put $100 million of\ncapital down in Indonesia, well hang on, where does this all fit in? Adding values emerges\nthrough debate and challenges and practical suggestions from the Non Executive Directors.\nHow are you going to take this model from here to there? Are we rigorous enough in our\ncontrol of costs? Are we doing things we shouldn't be doing? Should we be looking for more\noutsourcing? Could we gain through common business services? That's where good Non\nexecs come in. This is where the struggle to add value takes place.\nWith such a requirement, where does the new breed of Non Executive Director come\nfrom?\nThe plc, relative to society, is probably shrinking in terms of the talent bank because a lot of\ntalent has gone into venture capital (VC) which now employs approximately twenty per cent of\nprivate sector employees. Many executives also do not like the public visibility and\ntransparency of the plc. An AGM of 500 shareholders asking you whatever they please - not\neverybody can take that. In my view, the leakage of talent will continue because VCs are now\ncompeting with the equity market for the best Executive talent. The VCs are now the new\nconglomerates. This is Arnold Weinstock being reborn in the form of the Carlyle Group, Trans\nPacific, CVC, etc.\nHowever, despite the VC influence, there is still a lot of young talent coming through. I have\nsaid to our Executive Directors and the Board, that as part of the development of Executive\ntalent we want them to have the opportunity to be groomed, coached and developed to be\npotential Chief Executive material. So we've developed such a template for our Executive\nDevelopment Plan. Part of it, at the right moment in their career, is to support them, find an\nexternal Non Executive Director role. They are also sent to Business School for specific\ncourses and on courses about the responsibilities of a plc Director, etc. So they are exposed\nto a range of training and coaching. But the best form of development is to serve on another\nBoard as a Non Executive Director. The new company will benefit from talented, younger\nexecutives from another business sector whilst the individual will have a unique experience to\ngrow in another Boardroom and discover the different ground occupied by the Non-Executive\nDirectors.\nThank you, Sir John, for a most enlightening interview.\n"}
