We use several historical and implied \nparameter measures. Beyond the standard neural networks, in our analysis we include \nhybrid networks that incorporate information from the parametric models. Our results are \nsignificant and differ from previous literature. We show that the Black and Scholes based \nhybrid artificial neural network models outperform the standard neural networks and the \nparametric ones. We also investigate the economic significance of the best models using \ntrading strategies (extended with the Chen and Johnson modified hedging approach). We find \nthat there exist profitable opportunities even in the presence of transaction costs.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\n1. Introduction \n \n In this paper we compare parametric option pricing models (OPMs) -- Black \nand Scholes (1973) (BS) and the semi-parametric Corrado and Su (1996) (CS) -- with \nseveral artificial neural network (ANN) configurations. We compare them with respect \nto pricing the S&P 500 European call options, and trading strategies are \nimplemented in the presence of transaction costs. \nBlack and Scholes introduced in 1973 their milestone OPM. Despite the fact \nthat BS and its variants are considered as the most prominent achievements in \nfinancial theory in the last three decades, empirical research has shown that the \nformula suffers from systematic biases (see Black and Scholes, 1975, MacBeth and \nMerville, 1980, Gultekin et al., 1982, Rubinstein, 1985, Bates, 1991 and 2003, \nBakshi et al., 1997, Andersen et al., 2002, and Cont and Fonseca, 2002). The BS \nbias stems from the fact that the model has been developed under a set of simplified \nassumptions such as geometric Brownian motion of stock price movements, \nconstant variance of the underlying returns, continuous trading on the underlying \nasset, constant interest rates, etc.  \nPost-BS research (e.g. stochastic volatility, jump-diffusion, stochastic interest \nrates, etc.) has not managed to either generalize all the assumptions of BS or provide \nresults truly consistent with the observed market data. These models are often too \ncomplex to implement, have poor out-of-sample pricing performance and have \nimplausible and sometimes inconsistent implied parameters (see Bakshi et al., \n1997). This justifies the severe time endurance of BS1. Together with the BS model, \nwe also consider the semi-parametric CS model that allows for excess skewness and \nkurtosis, as a model that can proxy for other more complex parametric ones.  \n Nonparametric techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks are promising \nalternatives to the parametric OPMs. ANNs do not necessarily involve directly any \nfinancial theory because the option\u2019s price is estimated inductively using historical \nor implied input variables and option transactions data. Option-pricing functions are \nmultivariate and highly nonlinear, so ANNs are desirable approximators of the \nempirical option pricing function. Parametric models describe a stationary nonlinear \nrelationship between a theoretical option price and various variables. Since it is \nknown that market participants change their option pricing attitudes from time to \ntime (i.e. Rubinstein, 1985) a stationary model may fail to adjust to such rapidly \nchanging market behavior (see also Cont and Fonseca, 2002, for evidence of \nnoticeable variation in daily implied parameters). ANNs if frequently trained can \n                                                 \n1 According to Andersen et al., (2002), \u201cthe option pricing formula associated with the Black and Scholes \ndiffusion is routinely used to price European options, although it is known to produce systematic biases\u201d. \n \n3\nadapt to changing market conditions, and can potentially correct the aforementioned \nBS bias (Hutchison et al., 1994, Lajbcygier et al., 1996, Garcia and Gencay, 2000, \nYao and Tan, 2000).  \nBeyond the standard ANN target function we further examine the hybrid ANN \ntarget function suggested by Watson and Gupta (1996) and used for pricing options \nwith ANNs in Lajbcygier et al. (1997). In the hybrid models the target function is the \nresidual between the actual call market price and the parametric option price \nestimate. In previous studies the standard steepest descent backpropagation \nalgorithm is (mostly) used for training the feedforward ANNs. It is shown in \nCharalambous (1992) that this learning algorithm is often unable to converge rapidly \nto the optimal solution. Here we utilize the modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) \nalgorithm which is much more sophisticated and efficient in terms of time capacity \nand accuracy (Hagan and Menhaj, 1994). In contrast to most previous studies, \nthorough cross-validation allows us to use a different network configuration in \ndifferent testing periods.  \nThe data for this research come from two dominant world markets, the New \nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the S&P 500 equity index and the Chicago Board of \nOptions Exchange (CBOE) for call option contracts, spanning a period from January \n1998 to August 2001. To our knowledge, the resulting dataset is larger than the ones \nused in other published studies. We also (similarly to Rubinstein, 1985, Bates, 1996, \nBakshi et al., 1997; see discussion in Bates, 2003) reserve option datapoints that in \nseveral ANN studies were dropped out of the analysis. Note that in order to check the \nrobustness of the results we repeated the analysis using a reduced dataset following \nHutchison et al. (1994). We examine more explanatory variables including historical, \nweighted average implied and pure implied parameters. Also, instead of constant \nmaturity riskless interest rate, we use nonlinear interpolation for extracting a \ncontinuous rate according to each option\u2019s time to maturity.   \nLastly, although previous researchers have exploited BS or ANNs, little has \nbeen reported for the case of CS2 and nothing for the hybrid ANNs that use \ninformation derived by CS. To investigate the economic significance of the alternative \noption pricing approaches, trading strategies without and with the inclusion of \ntransaction costs are utilized. These trading strategies are implemented with the \nstandard delta-hedging values implied by each model, but also with the corrected \nvalues according to the (widely neglected) Chen and Johnson (1985) methodology.   \n In the following we first review the BS and CS models, and the standard and \nhybrid ANN model configuration. Then we discuss the dataset, the historical and \n                                                 \n2 An exception is the paper by Sami Vahamaa (2003) that examined the hedging performance of the CS \nmodel without including transaction costs.  \n \n4\nimplied parameter estimates we derive, and we define the parametric and ANN \nmodels according to the parameters used. Subsequently we review the numerical \nresults with respect to the in- and out-of-sample pricing errors; and we discuss the \neconomic significance of dynamic trading strategies both in the absence and in the \npresence of transaction costs.  The final section concludes. In general, our results \nare novel and significant. We identify the best hybrid ANN models, and we provide \nevidence that (even in the presence of transaction costs), profitable trading \nopportunities still exist. \n \n \n2. Option pricing: BS, CS and ANNs \n \n2.1. The parametric models \n \nThe Black Scholes formula for European call options modified for dividend-\npaying underlying asset is: \n \n1 2( ) ( )\nBS T rTc Se N d Xe N d\u03b4\u2212 \u2212= \u2212 ,           (1) \nwhere, \n- 2\n1\nln( \/ ) ( ) ( ) \/2S X r T Td \u03b4 \u03c3\u03c3\n+ += \u03a4 ,    (1.a)   \nand \n2 1d d T\u03c3= \u2212 .  (1.b) \n \nBSc \u2261premium paid for the European call option; S \u2261 spot price of the underlying asset; \nX \u2261 exercise price of the option; r \u2261 continuously compounded riskless interest rate; \n\u03b4 \u2261 continuous dividend yield paid by the underlying asset; T \u2261 time left until the \noption expiration; 2\u03c3 \u2261yearly variance rate of return for the underlying asset; (.)N \u2261 the \nstandard normal cumulative distribution. \nThe standard deviation of continuous returns (\u03c3) is the only variable in \nEquations 1.a and 1.b that cannot be directly observed in the market. For this study, \nwe use both historical and implied volatility forecasts. For the Historical Volatility we \nuse the past 60 days. The Implied Volatility (IVL) calculation involves solving \nEquation 1 iteratively for \u03c3  given the values of the observable mrkc  (the most \nrecently observed market price of a call option), and the relevant values of S, X, T, r \nand \u03b4 . Contrary to historical volatility, IVL has desirable properties that make it \n \n5\nattractive to practitioners: it is forward looking, and avoids the assumption that past \nvolatility will be repeated.  \n If BS is a well-specified model, then all IVLs on the same underlying asset \nshould be the same, or at least deterministic functions of time. Unfortunately, many \nresearchers have reported systematic biases. For example, Rubinstein (1985) has \nshown that IVL derived via BS as a function of the moneyness ratio (S\/X) and time to \nexpiration (T) often exhibits a U shape, the well known volatility smile. Bakshi et al. \n(1997) report that implicit stock returns\u2019 distributions are negatively skewed with \nmore excess kurtosis than allowable in the BS lognormal distribution. This is why we \nusually refer to BS as being a misspecified model with an inherent source of bias \n(see also Latane and Rendleman, 1976, Bates, 1991, Canica and Figlewski, 1993, \nBakshi et al., 2000, and Andersen et al., 2002). For the aforementioned reason we \ninclude in our analysis the Corrado and Su (1996) (see also the correction in Brown \nand Robinson, 2002) model that explicitly allows for excess skewness and kurtosis. \nThe CS model is a semi-parametric model since it does not rely on specific \nassumptions about the underlying stochastic process. Corrado and Su define their \nmodel as: \n  \n3 3 4 4( 3)\nCS BSc c Q Q\u03bc \u03bc= + + \u2212 ,     (2) \n2\n3 1 1 1\n1 ((2 ) ( ) ( ))\n3!\nTQ Se T T d n d T d\u03b4 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3\u2212= \u2212 \u2212 \u039d ,  (2.a) \n2 3 3\/2\n4 1 1 1 1\n1 (( 1 3 ( )) ( ) ( ))\n4!\nTQ Se T d T d T n d T N d\u03b4 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3\u2212= \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + ,  (2.b) \n)2\/exp(\n2\n1)( 2z\n\u03c0\nzn \u2212= ,  (2.c) \n \nwhere cBS is the BS value for the European call option adjusted for dividends, and 3\u03bc  \nand 4\u03bc  are the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of the returns.  \n \n2.2. Neural networks \n \n A Neural Network is a collection of interconnected simple processing elements \nstructured in successive layers and can be depicted as a network of \narcs\/connections and nodes\/neurons. Fig. 1 depicts a fully-connected ANN \narchitecture similar to the one applied in this study. This network has three layers: \nan input layer with N input variables, a hidden layer with H neurons, and a single \n \n6\nneuron output layer. Each connection is associated with a weight, kiw , and a bias, \nkb , in the hidden layer and a weight, kv , and a bias, 0v , for the output layer (k = \n1,2,\u2026,H, i = 1,2,\u2026,N). A particular neuron node is composed of: i) the vector of input \nsignals, ii) the vector weights and the associated bias, iii) the neuron itself that sums \nthe product of the input signal with the corresponding weights and bias, and finally, \niv) the neuron transfer function. In addition, the outputs of the hidden layer \n( (1) (1) (1)1 2, ... Hy y y ) are the inputs for the output layer. Since we want to approximate the \nmarket options pricing function, ANNs operate as a non-linear regression tool: \n \n( ) ANNY G x \u03b5= +% ,    (3) \n \nthat maps the unknown relation, G(.), between the input variable vector, \n1 2[ , ,..., ]Nx x x x=% , the target function, Y , and the error term, ANN\u03b5 . Inputs are set up \nin feature vectors, 1 2[ , ..., ]q q q Nqx x x x=%  for which there is an associated and known \ntarget, qY t\u2261  (in our case, \/mrkq q qt c X\u2261 ), with 1,2,...,q P\u2261 , where P is the number of \nthe available sample features. According to Fig. 1, the operation carried out for \nestimating output y  (in our case, \/qANNq qy c X\u2261 ), is the following: \n \n0 0\n1 1\n[ ( )]\nH N\nk H k ki i\nk i\ny f v v f b w x\n= =\n= + +\u2211 \u2211 .    (4) \n[Figure 1 here] \n \nFor the purpose of this study, the hidden layer always uses the hyperbolic tangent \nsigmoid transfer function, while the output layer uses a linear transfer function. In \naddition, ANN architectures with only one hidden layer are considered since they \noperate as a nonlinear regression tool and can be trained to approximate most \nfunctions arbitrarily well (Cybenko, 1989). High accuracy can be obtained by \nincluding enough processing nodes in the hidden layer.  \n To train the ANNs, we utilized the modified LM algorithm. According to LM, \nthe weights and the biases of the network are updated in such a way so as to \nminimize the following sum of squares performance function: \n \n2 2 2\n0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n( ) ( ) ( [ ( )] )\nP P P H N\nq q q k H k ki iq q\nq q q k i\nF W e y t f v v f b w x t\n= = = = =\n= \u2261 \u2212 \u2261 + + \u2212\u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 ,                             (5) \n \n \n7\nwhere, W  is an n-dimensional column vector containing the weights and biases: \n1 11 0[ ,..., , ,..., , ,..., ]\nT\nH HN HW b b w w v v= . Then, at each iteration \u03c4 of LM, the weights \nvector W is updated as follows: \n \n)()(])()([ \u03c4\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4 \u03bc WeWJIWJWJWW TT 11 \u2212+ +\u2212= ,                                                     (6) \n \nwhere I is an n\u00b0n identity matrix, ( )J W  is the P\u00b0n Jacobian matrix of the P-\ndimensional output error column vector ( )e W , and \u03c4\u03bc  is like a learning parameter \nthat is adjusted in each iteration in order to secure convergence. Further technical \ndetails about the implementation of LM can be found in Hagan and Menhaj (1994) \nand Hagan et al. (1996). In addition to the standard use of ANNs where \/mrkq q qt c X\u2261 , \nwe also try hybrid ANNs in which the target function is the residual between the \nactual call market price and the BS or CS call option estimation:  \n \n\/ \/mrk kq q q q qt c X c X\u2261 \u2212 ,                (7) \n \nwith k defining inputs from a parametric model. To avoid neuron saturation, we \nscale input variables using the mean-variance transformation (z-score) defined as \nfollows: \n \n( )\/i i i iz x s\u03bc= \u2212% % ,    (8) \n \nwhere ix%  is the vector containing all of the available observations related to a certain \ninput\/output variable for a specific training period, i\u03bc  is the mean and is  the \nstandard deviation of this vector. Moreover, we also utilize the network initialization \ntechnique proposed by Nguyen and Windrow (see Hagan et al., 1996) that generates \ninitial weights and bias values for a nonlinear transfer function so that the active \nregions of the layer\u2019s neurons are distributed roughly evenly over the input space.  \n In this study for each input variable set of each training sample, all the \navailable networks having two to ten hidden neurons are cross-validated (in total \nnine). Moreover, since the initial network weights affect the final network \nperformance, for a specific number of hidden neurons the network is initialized, \ntrained and validated many times. Each network is estimated and optimized using \nthe Mean Square Error (MSE) criterion shown in Equation 5 for no more than two-\nhundred iterations. The dataset is divided into three sub-sets. The first is the \ntraining (estimation) set. The second is the validation set where the ANN model\u2019s error \n \n8\nis monitored and the optimal number of hidden neurons and their weights are \ndefined, via an early stopping procedure (MSE fails to decrease in 10 consecutive \niterations). Given the optimal ANN structure, its pricing capability is tested in a third \nseparate testing dataset.  \n \n \n3. Data, parameter estimates (historical and implied), and model \nimplementation \n \n Our dataset covers the period January 1998 to August 2001. To our \nknowledge, the resulting dataset is larger than the one used in other published \nstudies and reserves option data points that in most of the previous studies were \ndropped out of the analysis. After implementing the filtering rules, our dataset \nconsists of 76,401 data points, with an average of 35,000 data points per \n(overlapping rolling training-validation-testing) sub-period (see Fig. 2). Hutchison et \nal. (1994) have an average of 6,246 data points per sub-period. Lajbcygier et al. \n(1996) include 3,308 data points, Yao et al. (2000) include 17,790 data points, and \nSchittenkopf and Dorffner (2001) include 33,633 data points. The S&P 500 Index call \noptions are considered because this option market is extremely liquid and one of the \nmost popular index options traded on the CBOE. This market is the closest to the \ntheoretical setting of the parametric models. Along with the index, we have collected \na daily dividend yield, \u03b4 , provided online by Datastream.  \n \n3.1. Observed and historically estimated parameters \n \n Moneyness Ratio (S\/X): The moneyness ratio may explicitly allow the ANNs to \nlearn the moneyness bias associated with the BS (see also Garcia and Gencay, \n2000). The dividend adjusted moneyness ratio ( )\/TSe X\u03b4\u2212  is used in this study with \nANNs because it is more informative. The simple moneyness ratio S\/X is used in \norder to tabulate results as in Hutchison et al. (1994). We adopt the following \nterminology: very deep out of the money (VDOTM) when S\/X<0.85, deep out the \nmoney (DOTM) when 0.85\u2264S\/X<0.90, out the money (OTM) when 0.90\u2264S\/X<0.95, just \nout the money (JOTM) when 0.95\u2264S\/X<0.99, at the money (ATM) when \n0.99\u2264S\/X<1.01, just in the money (JITM) when 1.01\u2264 S\/X <1.05, in the money (ITM) \nwhen 1.05\u2264S\/X<1.10, deep in the money (DITM) when 1.10\u2264S\/X<1.35, and very deep \nin the money (VDITM) when S\/X\u22651.35.   \n  Time to maturity (T ): For each option contract, trading days are computed \nassuming 252 days in a year. In terms of time length, an option contract is classified \n \n9\nas short term maturity when its maturity is less than 60 days, as medium term \nmaturity when its maturity is between 60 and 180 days and as long term maturity \nwhen it has maturity longer than (or equal to) 180 days.   \n Riskless interest rate (r ):  Most of the studies use 90-day T-bill rates (or \nsimilar when this is unavailable) as approximation of the interest rate. We use \nnonlinear cubic spline interpolation for matching each option contract with a \ncontinuous interest rate, r , that corresponds to the option\u2019s maturity, by utilizing \nthe 3-month, 6-month and one-year T-bill rates collected from the U.S. Federal \nReserve Bank Statistical Releases. \n Historical Volatilities (\u03c3 ): The 60-day historical volatility is calculated using all \nthe past 60 log-relative index returns and is symbolized as 60\u03c3 . \n CBOE VIX Volatility Index: It was developed by CBOE in 1993 and is a \nmeasure of the volatility of the S&P 100 Index3. VIX is calculated by taking the \nweighted average of the implied volatilities of eight S&P 100 Index call and put \noptions with an average time to maturity of 30 days. This volatility measure can only \nbe used with BS and is symbolized as BSvix\u03c3 .  \n Skewness and Kurtosis: The 60-day skewness ( 3,60\nCS\u03bc ) and kurtosis ( 4,60CS\u03bc ) \nneeded for the CS model are approximated from the sixty most recent log-returns of \nthe S&P 500.      \n \n3.2. Implied parameters \n \n We adopt the Whaley\u2019s (1982) simultaneous equation procedure to minimize a \nprice deviation function with respect to the unobserved parameters. As with Bates \n(1991), market option prices (cmrk) are assumed to be the corresponding model prices \n(ck, k defining input from a parametric model) plus a random additive disturbance \nterm. For any option set of size Nt (Nt refers to the number of different call option \ntransaction datapoints available on a specific day), the difference: \n \nk\nN\nmrk\nN\nk\nN ttt\ncc \u2212=\u03b5     (9) \n \nbetween the market and the model value of a certain option is a function of the \nvalues taken by the unknown parameters. To find optimal implied parameter values \nwe solve an unconstrained optimization problem that has the following form: \n                                                 \n3 The S&P 100 Index and S&P 500 Index exhibit 30 day log-return average correlations for the period \nJanuary 1998 to August 2002 of about 0.98. \n \n10\n \n\u2211\n=\n= t\nk\nN\nl\nk\nl )(min)t(SSE\n1\n2\u03b5\n\u03b8\n,  (10) \n \nwhere t represents the time instance, and k\u03b8  the unknown parameters associated \nwith a specific parametric OPM ( { }BS\u03b8 \u03c3= , 3 4{ , , }CS\u03b8 \u03c3 \u03bc \u03bc= ). The SSE is minimized via \na non-linear least squares optimization based on the LM algorithm. To minimize the \npossibility to obtain implied parameters that correspond to a local minimum of the \nerror surface (see also Bates, 1991, and Bakshi et al., 1997), with each model we use \nthree different starting values for the unknown parameters based on reported \naverage values in Corrado and Su (1996).       \n A difference of our approach compared to previous studies is that the above \nminimization procedure is used daily to derive four different sets of implied \nparameters for each parametric model. The first optimization is performed by \nincluding all available options transaction data in a day to obtain daily average \nimplied structural parameters. Alternatively, for a certain day we minimize the SSE \nof Equation 10 by fitting the BS and CS for options that share the same maturity \ndate as long as four different available call options exist. We thus get daily average \nper maturity parameters. In a third step, for every maturity each available option \ncontract is grouped with its three nearest options in terms of the moneyness ratio in \norder to minimize the above SSE function, deriving thus parameters average per the \n4 closest contracts; such estimates are ignored in previous research. We finally \ncalibrate the implied structural parameters, by focusing on the Brownian volatility \nfor each contract so as to drive the residual error to zero or to a negligible value. In \nthe case of BS this is quite simple and we can easily obtain a contract specific \nvolatility estimate. For CS we need three structural parameters, so for each call \noption we minimize Equation 10 with respect to the Brownian volatility after fixing \nthe skewness and kurtosis coefficients to the values obtained from the previous \nprocedure that gave the average per the 4 closest implied parameters. Two kinds of \nconstraints are included in the optimization process for practical reasons: \nnonnegative implied volatility parameters are obtained by using an exponential \ntransformation; and the skewness of CS4 is permitted to vary in the range [\u201310, 5] \nwhereas kurtosis is constrained to be less than 30. Unlike previous studies, we \n                                                 \n4 If not somehow constrained, skewness and kurtosis can take implausible values (i.e. Bates, 1991) due \nto model overfitting that will lead to enormous pricing errors on the next day (especially for deep in the \nmoney options). In our case these constraints were binding in less than 2% of the whole dataset. \n \n11\ninclude contract specific implied parameters since these are widely used by market \npractitioners (i.e. Bakshi et al., 1997, pg. 2019).   \n For notational reasons, implied parameters obtained from the first step are \ndenoted by the subscript av, from the second step by the subscript avT, from the \nthird step by the subscript avT4, and from the fourth step by the subscript con. The \nfour different implied BS volatility estimates are symbolized as: BSj\u03c3 , \n},4,,{ conavTavTavj = , whilst the four different sets of CS parameters as: \n3, 4,{ , }\nCS CS CS\nj j j\u03c3 \u03bc \u03bc . For pricing and trading reasons at time instant t, the implied \nstructural parameters derived at day t-1 are used together with all other needed \ninformation (S, T, X, r, and \u03b4 ).  \n It is known that ANN input variables should be presented in a way that \nmaximizes their information content. When we price options, the parametric OPM \nformulas adjust those values to represent the appropriate value that corresponds to \nan option\u2019s expiration period. According to this rationale, volatility measures for use \nwith the ANNs are transformed by multiplying each of the yearly volatility forecast \nwith the square root of each option\u2019s time to maturity ( j j T\u03c3 \u03c3=% , where j={60, vix, \nav, avT, avT4, con}). We denote these volatility measures as BSj\u03c3%  and CSj\u03c3% ; and we \nname them as maturity (or expiration) adjusted volatilities. Additionally, for the case \nof CS, skewness 3,\nCS\nj\u03bc , {60, , , 4, }j av avT avT con= , is transformed by multiplication \nwith Q3 that represents the marginal effect of nonnormal skewness. Similarly, 4,\nCS\nj\u03bc  \nis multiplied with Q4. We denote these adjusted parameters as 3,\nCS\nj\u03bc%  (adjusted \nskewness), and 4,\nCS\nj\u03bc%  (adjusted kurtosis).  \n \n3.3. Output variables, filtering and processing \n  \n The BS ( BSqc ) and CS (\nCS\nqc ) outputs, are used as an estimate for the market \ncall option, mrkqc . For training ANNs, the call standardized by the striking price, \n\/mrkq qc X , is used as the target function to be approximated. In addition, we \nimplement the hybrid structure where the target function represents the pricing \nerror between the option\u2019s market price and the parametric models estimate, \n\/ \/mrk kq q q qc X c X\u2212 .  \n  Before filtering, more than 100,000 observations were included for the period \nJanuary 1998 \u2013 August 2001. The filtering rules we adopt are: i) eliminate an \n \n12\nobservation if the call contract price, mrkt,mc , m defining each traded contract, is greater \nthan the underlying asset value, tS ; ii) exclude an observation if the call moneyness \nratio is larger than unity, St\/Xm>1, and the call price, mrkt,mc , is less than its lower \nbound, , , , ,m t m t m t m tT r Tt mS e X e\n\u03b4\u2212 \u2212\u2212 ; iii) eliminate all the options observations with time to \nmaturity less than 6 trading days. The latter filtering rule is adopted to avoid extreme \noption prices that are observed due to potential illiquidity problems; iv) price quotes \nlower than 0.5 index points are not included; v) maturities with less than four call \noption observations are also eliminated, vi) in addition, to remove impact from thin \ntrading we eliminate observations according to the following rule: eliminate an \nobservation if the mrkt,mc  is equal to \nmrk\n1t,mc \u2212  and if the open interest for these days stays \nunchanged and if the underlying asset S has changed.  \n[Table 1, here] \n \n Our final dataset consists of 76,401 datapoints. Table 1 exhibits some of the \nproperties of our sample tabulated according to moneyness ratio and time to \nmaturity forming 27 different moneyness\/maturity classes. We provide the average \nvalues for cmrk and BScon\u03c3 , and the number of observations within each moneyness and \nmaturity class. The implied volatility, BScon\u03c3 , presents a non-flat moneyness structure \nwhen fixing the time to maturity and vice versa revealing the bias associated with \nBS. Moreover, we should notice that DITM and VDITM options dominate in number \nof datapoints all other classes, so unlike studies that ignore these options we choose \nto include them in the dataset. For the training sub-periods, the observations vary \nbetween: 19,852-22,545; for the validation sub-periods between: 10,372-10,916; and \nfor the testing sub-periods between: 3,797-4,264.  \n In order to check the robustness of the results, in addition to the full dataset \njust described, we repeat the analysis using a reduced dataset. In this reduced \ndataset we follow Hutchison et al. (1994), and we neither use long maturity (longer \nthan 180 trading days) options, nor the VDOTM (S\/X<0.85) or the VDITM (S\/X\u22651.35) \noptions. The excluded observations (because of considerations of thin trading) \ncomprise about 21% of the full dataset resulting in a total of 60,402 observations. \nThe training-validation-testing splitting dates are the same as in the original dataset. \nFor the training sub-periods, the observations vary between: 15,851-18,053; for the \nvalidation sub-periods: 7,728-9,638; and for the testing sub-periods: 2,689-3,983. \nTo be consistent with Hutchison et al. (1994), in using the reduced dataset we \n \n13\nretrain the ANNs. Our discussion will focus on the full dataset. In order to save \nspace, we will only show selected results using the reduced dataset. \n \n3.4. Validation and testing, and pricing performance measures \n \n Since a practitioner is faced with time-series data, it was decided to partition \nthe available data into training, validation and testing datasets using a chronological \nmanner, and via a rolling-forward procedure. Our dataset is divided into ten different \noverlapping training (Tr) and validation (Vd) sets, each followed by separate and non-\noverlapping testing (Ts) sets as exhibited by Fig. 2. The ten sequential testing sub-\nperiods cover the last 25 months of the complete dataset. \n[Figure 2, here] \n \nThere are M available call option contracts, for each of which there exist m\u039e  \nobservations taken in consecutive time instances t, resulting in a total of P \n(\n1\nM\nm\nm\nP\n=\n= \u039e\u2211 ) available call option datapoints. To determine the pricing accuracy of \neach model\u2019s estimates kc  (k defining the model), we examine the Root Mean Square \nError (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE): \n \n2\n1\n(1\/ ) ( )\np\nmrk k\nv v\nv\nRMSE p c c\n=\n= \u2212\u2211 ,   (11) \n1\n(1\/ )\np\nmrk k\nv v\nv\nMAE p c c\n=\n= \u2212\u2211 ,  (12) \n \nwhere p indicates the number of observations. The error measures are computed for \nan aggregate testing period (AggTs) with 39,831 datapoints by pooling together the \npricing estimates of all ten testing periods. For AggTs we also compute the Median of \nthe Absolute Error (MeAE). Of course, since ANNs are effectively optimized with \nrespect to the mean square error, the out-of-sample pricing performance should be \nsimilarly based on RMSE and in a lesser degree on MAE and MeAE. \n \n \n3.5. The alternative BS, CS and ANN models \n \n With the BS models we use as input S, X, T, r, \u03b4 , and any of the six different \nvolatility measures: 60\u03c3 , BSvix\u03c3 , BSav\u03c3 , BSavT\u03c3 , 4BSavT\u03c3  and BScon\u03c3 . Using P in the superscript \n \n14\nto denote the parametric version of BS, the six different models are symbolized as: \n60\nPBS , PvixBS , \nP\navBS , \nP\navTBS , 4\nP\navTBS , and \nP\nconBS . In a similar way there are five different \nCS models according to the kind of parameters used: 60\nPCS , PavCS , \nP\navTCS , 4\nP\navTCS , and \nP\nconCS .  \n With ANNs, we also use three standard input variables\/parameters: \n( )\/TSe X\u03b4\u2212 , T  and r . Additional input parameters depend on the parametric model \nconsidered. There are six ANN models that use as an additional input the above BS \nvolatility measures to map the standard target function cmrk\/X. There are six more \nversions that utilize the maturity adjusted parameters. Each of the previous input \nparameter sets is also used with the hybrid target function. The ANNs that use the \nuntransformed BS volatility forecast are denoted by N in the superscript, the \ntransformed versions by N*, while the corresponding hybrid versions by Nh and Nh* \nrespectively. For instance, NconBS  (\nNh\nconBS ) is the ANN model that uses as additional \ninput BScon\u03c3  and maps the standard (hybrid) target function, whilst *NconBS  ( *NhconBS ) the \nANN model that uses as additional input BScon\u03c3%  and maps the standard (hybrid) target \nfunction. In total there are 24 different versions of ANNs related to the BS and 20 \nrelated to the CS model. \n \n \n5. Pricing results and discussion \n \n We briefly review the observed in-sample fit of the parametric models as well \nas the in-sample characteristics of the various implied parameters. Then we discuss \nthe out-of-sample performance of the alternative OPMs. When we do not explicitly \nrefer to the dataset, we imply the full one. The insights derived were not affected by \nthe choice of dataset. When noteworthy differences exist, we state them explicitly. \n \n5.1. BS and CS in-sample fitting performance and implied parameters \n  \n Based on our (not reported in detail for brevity) statistics for the whole period \n(1998-2001) we have observed that CS is producing smaller fitting errors than the \nBS. The contract specific fitting procedure reduces the fitting errors so as to almost \neliminate the residuals and obtain fully calibrated implied parameters. The in sample \nRMSE measures using the overall average set of implied parameters (av), the average \nper maturity (avT), and the closest four contracts (avT4), are: 11.63, 11.31, and 7.00 \n \n15\nfor the BS model; and 9.52, 8.52, and 5.35 for the CS model5. From unreported \nstatistics we can also attest that the S&P 500 average BScon\u03c3  in 1998 was about 33%, \nin 1999 about 30%, in 2000 about 26% and in 2001 about 27%. It seems that the \nin-sample fitting error of the models (diminishing in time) is positively correlated \nwith the market volatility.    \n We can also provide some statistics about the implied parameter values for \nthe whole period. The Brownian volatility varies between 22% and 30% in BS and \nbetween 27% and 31% in CS. For the BS model, the average implied volatility ( BSav\u03c3 ) \nestimates are smaller in magnitude (both in mean and in median values) from the \ncontract specific implied volatility, BScon\u03c3 , although similar volatility estimates do not \nnecessarily lead to similar pricing and hedging values (Bakshi et al., 1997). \nRegarding implied skewness and kurtosis, the implicit distributions are negatively \nskewed with excess kurtosis in almost all days, something that is probably \nattributed to the crash fears of the market participants after the Black Monday of \n1987. Implied average skewness does not change significantly (from -1.19 to -1.20) if \nwe move from {av} to {avT} but there is a shift in implied average kurtosis (from 6.91 \nto 6.19).  \n \n5.2. Out-of-sample pricing results \n \n Table 2, exhibits the performance of all parametric and ANN models \nconsidered in this study in terms of RMSE, MAE and MeAE for the AggTs (aggregate) \nperiod. In Table 3 we tabulate statistics for a pairwise comparison of the (statistical \nsignificance of) pricing performance of a selection of models. Since the ten testing \nperiods are disjoint and because we have pricing estimates coming from different \nOPMs we can assume (similarly to Hutchison et al, 1994 and Schittenkopf and \nDorffner, 2001) that the pricing errors are independent and standard t-test can be \napplied. Similarly to the previous authors we need to report that these tests should \nbe interpreted with caution. The upper diagonal of Table 3 reports the t-values taken \nby a two-tail matched-pair test about the MAE of the alternative models whilst the \nlower diagonal exhibits the two-tail matched-pair t-test values about the MSE of the \ncompared OPMs. Table 4 provides (as a robustness check) the performance of the \nmodels when using the reduced dataset. \n[Table 2, 3 and 4, here] \n                                                 \n5 The RMSE for CS in the fourth step (con) is 1.82 (caused by a tiny part of the dataset less than 0.1%) \ndue to binding constraints on skewness and kurtosis. For this step, the MeAE is more appropriate, and \nis effectively zero. The RMSE and the MeAE for BS in the fourth step are effectively zero. \n \n16\n \n By looking at Tables 2 and 4 we can see that the use of implied instead of \nhistorical parameters improves performance, both for parametric and ANN models \n(in both datasets). Note that the 60-day historical volatility performed better than \nVIX with the parametric BS model, but the VIX volatility measure performed better \nwith the ANN models. Using time adjusted parameters in the ANNs or using contract \nspecific parameters {avT4, con} usually improves performance. The combination of \ntime adjusted parameters and contract specific parameters always provided the best \nmodel within each class of ANNs (standard or hybrid, BS or CS based) in both \ndatasets. \n In comparing the parametric models and again looking at Tables 2 and 4, it is \nnoteworthy that CS outperforms BS when average implied parameters are used. BS \nstill works better with contract specific parameters. The overall best among the \nparametric models is the contract specific BS model. In other more complex \nparametric models that include jumps and stochastic volatility components (i.e. \nBakshi et al., 1997), deriving implied parameters may lead to model overfitting. The \ncontract specific approach we adopt in this study seems not to lead to model \noverfitting, retaining thus good out-of-sample properties. For the ANN models, the \nCS based may outperform the BS based in some cases, but when the best \ncombinations are used (time adjusted parameters and contract specific parameters), \nthe best model always is BS based in both the standard and hybrid networks. \n In comparing the parametric models with the standard ANNs, in the full \ndataset the ANNs never outperform the equivalent parametric ones. Apparently, the \nstandard ANNs cannot perform well in the extreme data regions. In the reduced \ndataset (see Table 4), we observe the opposite since the standard ANNs always \noutperform the equivalent parametric ones. \n In comparing the hybrid with the standard ANNs, in the full dataset the \nhybrid are always better. In the reduced dataset this may not always be the case, but \nthe best combinations (time adjusted parameters and contract specific parameters) \ngive as the best model always a hybrid one.  \n In both the full and the reduced dataset, the hybrid always outperform the \nequivalent parametric ones. Finally, in both the full and the reduced dataset, the \noverall best model is the BS based hybrid with time adjusted and contract specific \nvolatility. \n \n From Table 3, we can confirm the statistical significance of the best models. \nThe comparative results we discuss with tests using the full dataset, and they also \nhold for the reduced dataset (statistics not reported for brevity). We can see that \n \n17\n*Nh\nconBS  outperforms all other models. Specifically, \n*Nh\nconBS  is producing a RMSE equal \nto 6.01 and a MAE equal to 2.61, pricing measures that are smaller that any other \nmodel at the 5% significance level.  \n The BS based hybrid ANNs even with historical or the VIX volatility measure \nare considerably better than the equivalent parametric alternatives at a statistically \nsignificant level. Specifically, *60\nNhBS  is producing 1.23 (1.25) times smaller MSE \n(MAE) compared to 60\nPBS . Also *NhvixBS  produces 1.52 (1.90) times smaller MSE (MAE) \ncompared to PvixBS .  \n Comparing the out-of-sample pricing performance of *NhconBS  to \n*Nh\nconCS  we \nobserve that the extra ANN flexibility of the latter due to the two additional input \nparameters does not lead to increased accuracy. The *NhconBS  is better than the \n*Nh\nconCS  \nmodel at 1% significance level. \n We can similarly see the statistical significance of the superiority of the BS \nbased models with contract specific volatility versus the equivalent CS based models \n(both parametric and hybrid); and the superiority of the models using the implied \nvolatility versus the equivalent ones using the historical volatility measures.  \n \n5.3. Other statistics \n \n We tabulate in Table 5 the MSE of a selective (but representative) choice of \nmodels, according to the various moneyness and maturity classes for the aggregate \n(AggTs) period. We demonstrate results for the two best performing parametric \nmodels which serve as benchmark ( PconBS , \nP\nconCS ,) and the two best performing (in \ntheir respective class) hybrid ANN models ( *NhconBS , \n*Nh\nconCS ). We also demonstrate \nresults for the reduced dataset ( *NhconBS , \n*Nh\nconCS ). The relevant information for the \nparametric models in the reduced dataset can be taken from the information \nconcerning the full if we ignore the long maturities, and the VDOTM and the VDITM \nclasses. Very briefly, what can be seen is that PconBS  has a smaller RMSE in all data \nclasses compared to PconCS . The same holds for \n*Nh\nconBS  over \n*Nh\nconCS . If we compare the \nBS and CS based hybrid models with the equivalent parametric ones, the hybrid \nANN models rarely underperform the parametric ones, and they do so only in some \nclasses far away from ATM. This we attribute to the scarcity of such call option \ndatapoints in the training samples compared to other moneyness and maturity \nclasses.  \n[Table 5, here] \n \n18\n \n We should finally comment on the complexity of each neural network \nconfiguration. Since we have a constant number of inputs within each model class, \nthe larger the number of hidden neurons the more complex the ANN model \narchitecture, and the more complex the target function to be approximated. Firstly, \nwe observe that the number of hidden neurons changes significantly between sub-\nperiods. This contradicts many previous studies that employ the assumption that \nthe market\u2019s options pricing mechanism is the same for all periods examined and \nthat a constant ANN structure is sufficient. Secondly, the standard target function is \nmore complex compared to the hybrid one, hence this hybrid category of networks \ncan perform better in out-of-sample pricing. Thus, it is not surprising that the best \nperforming ANN model, *NhconBS , demonstrates the simplest structure with an average \nof 3.2 hidden layer neurons, compared to the 8 hidden layer neurons in the case of \nthe equivalent standard ANN ( *NconBS ). Similarly for the CS-based ANNs, we have 4.9 \n(for *NhconCS ) and 7.7 (for \n*N\nconCS ) hidden layer neurons respectively. Similar network \ncomplexities (not reported) were observed in the reduced dataset. \n \n \n6. Delta neutral trading strategies \n \n We now investigate the economic significance of the best performing models in \noptions trading. In order to save space we discuss the parametric versions of BS and \nCS which are usually the benchmark, and the hybrid ANN models which provided \nthe overall best performance. Other studies usually restrict their analysis only to a \nhedging investigation of various alternative OPM models (i.e. Hutchison et al., 1994, \nGarcia and Gencay, 2000, Schittenkopf and Dorffner, 2001) and avoid exploiting \ntrading strategies. It is known from previous studies that the best OPM in terms of \nout-of-sample pricing performance does not always prove to be the best solution \nwhen we consider delta hedging, since ANNs are optimized based on a pricing error \ncriterion. Instead, and following the spirit of Black and Scholes (1972), Galai (1977), \nand Whaley (1982), we investigate the economic significance of the OPMs by \nimplementing trading strategies. \u201cA model that consistently achieves to identify \nmispriced options and within a time period produces an amount of trading profits \nwill always be preferred by a practitioner\u201d (Black and Scholes, 1972). The trading \nprofitability that we will document, indirectly also hints to potential option market \ninefficiencies, although testing market efficiency is beyond the scope of our study. \nWe implement trading strategies based on single instrument hedging, as for example \nin Bakshi et al. (1997). In addition, we consider various levels of transaction costs, \n \n19\nand we focus on dynamic strategies that are cost-effective. We later extend the \nanalysis by implementing a modified approach for trading using hedging ratios \nobtained via the (widely neglected) Chen and Johnson (1985) method. To our \nknowledge, this is the first effort to validate this modified trading strategy using both \nparametric and ANN OPMs.  \n In the trading strategy we implement,  we create portfolios by buying (selling) \noptions undervalued (overvalued) relative to a model\u2019s prediction and taking a delta \nhedging position in the underlying asset. This (single-instrument) delta hedging \nfollows the no-arbitrage strategy of Black and Scholes (1973), where a portfolio \nincluding a short (long) position in a call is hedged via a long (short) position in the \nunderlying asset, and the hedged portfolio rebalancing takes place in discrete time \nintervals (in an optimal manner, not necessarily daily). At time t, if according to the \nmodel the mth call option contract is overvalued (undervalued) relative to its market \nvalue, ,\nmrk\nm tc , we go short (long) in this contract and we go long (short) in ,\nk\nm t\u0394  \u201cindex \nshares6\u201d, where k denotes the relevant model. Then we invest the residual, ,m tB , in a \nriskless bond. Note that ,\nk\nm t\u0394  is the partial derivative of the option price with respect \nto the underlying asset, , \/\nk\nm t tc S\u2202 \u2202 , depending on the OPM under consideration. ,ANNm t\u0394  \ncan be calculated by differentiating Equation 4 via the chain rule. The expression for \n,\nBS\nm t\u0394   is 1( )Te N d\u03b4\u2212  and is derived from Equation 2.1. The expression for ,CSm t\u0394  includes \n,\nBS\nm t\u0394  and is: \n \n, , 3 3 4 4( 3)\nCS BS\nm t m t \u03bc \u03bc\u0394 = \u0394 + \u03a6 + \u2212 \u03a6 ,  (13) \n \nwhere 33\nQ\nS\n\u2202\u03a6 = \u2202  and \n4\n4\nQ\nS\n\u2202\u03a6 = \u2202  are given below: \n \n3 2 2\n3 1 1 1 1\n1 (( ) ( ) ( )[3( ) 3 ( ) 1])\n3!\ne d n d T d T d\u03b4 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3\u2212 \u03a4\u03a6 = \u03a4 \u039d + \u2212 + \u2212 ,  (13.a) \n \n4 3 2\n4 1 1 1 1 1\n2 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 (( ) ( ) 4 ( )(( ) 6( ) ( )( ) 4 ( )( )\n4!\n4( ) ( )( ) 3( ) ( ) ( ) ( )).\ne T N d n d T d n d T n d T\nd n d T d n d d n d\n\u03b4 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u2212 \u03a4\u03a6 = + \u2212 \u2212 +\n+ \u2212\n (13.b) \n \n In general we avoid a naive (expensive) trading strategy with daily rebalancing, \nsince in the presence of transaction costs this would become prohibitively expensive. \n                                                 \n6 Similarly to Bakshi et al. (1997) we assume that the spot S&P 500 index is a traded security. \n \n20\nInstead, the position is held as long as the call is undervalued (overvalued) without \nnecessarily daily rebalancing. Then the position is liquidated and the profit or loss is \ncomputed, tabulated separately and a new position is generated according to the \nprevailing conditions in the options market. This procedure is carried out for all \ncontracts included in the dataset. We rebalance our position in the underlying asset \nto keep the appropriate hedge ratio. Rebalanced positions in the index, ,m t tV +\u0394 , and \nthe bond, ,m t tB +\u0394 , are according to: \n \n, , ,( )m t t t t m t t m tV S+\u0394 +\u0394 +\u0394= \u00b1 \u0394 \u2212 \u0394 , and , , ,r tm t t m t m t tB B e V\u0394+\u0394 +\u0394= + ,  (14) \n \nwhere the positive sign is considered when we treat undervalued and the negative \nsign when we treat overvalued options. Note that in all trading strategies, when we \nneed to invest money we borrow and pay the riskless rate; similarly we do for as long \nas a strategy provides losses. Thus, when we present profits they are always above \nthe dollar return on the riskless rate. \n Computed statistics include the total profit or loss (P&L), the number of \ntrades (# Trades), the total profit or loss at 0.2% transaction costs, P&L (0.2%), and \n0.4% transaction costs, P&L (0.4%). The (proportional) transaction costs are paid for \nboth positions (in the call option and in the \u201cindex shares\u201d)7. We also implement \nstrategies with enhanced cost-effectiveness by ignoring trades that involve call \noptions whose absolute percentage mispricing error, | |\/k mrk kc c c\u2212 , is less than a \nmispricing margin d = 15%, found as P&L (d = 15%). In addition, for these strategies, \nwe also calculate P&L under aggregate transaction costs for the \u201cindex shares\u201d. With \nsuch aggregation, transactions in the underlying assets are paid on the net \n(aggregate) exposure of ,m t tV +\u0394  and not on each position individually. Under this \nstrategy, we expect additional cost savings that may provide profits even at rather \nhigh transaction cost levels. We use the prefix Agg. in front of P&L to indicate this \nstrategy. The following observations refer to the full dataset, but they also hold for \nthe reduced one (unreported due to brevity considerations). \n The results for the parametric BS and CS models are tabulated in Panel A of \nTables 6 and 7 respectively. We observe that all models before transaction costs \nproduce significant profits, implying that both BS and CS can successfully identify \nmispriced options. Within BS models the magnitude of P&L is larger for PconBS  that \n                                                 \n7 For example, assume that the index is at 1300 and a call option has a market price equal to 25 index \npoints and a delta value of 0.60. Under 0.4% transaction costs the total commissions paid (for a single \ntrade) will be 3.22 index points. In the AggTs period the S&P 500 was in a range from about 1100 to \n1500. This level of transaction costs is low but attainable by professional traders and market makers. \n \n21\nemploys a more sophisticated implied volatility forecast. Note though that the more \nsophisticated volatility forecast that is used with BS, the larger the number of trades. \nSo, when 0.2% transaction costs are taken into consideration, all models produce \nsignificant losses and the previous profit dominance of PconBS  over 60\nPBS  reverts \nbecause the latter model incurs less transaction costs (since it engages in a smaller \nnumber of trades). Similar results hold for the CS models although 4\nP\navTCS  generates \nslightly higher profits compared to PconCS . Realizing that our simpler trading strategy \ndoes not discriminate between high or low expected trading profits, we compute P&L \nwhen trades occur only when an expected profit of at least d = 15% is expected. Now \nwe observe that all models can be profitable even under 0.4% transaction costs. \n Overall we may conclude the following. First, without transaction costs, the \nCS models produce higher P&L than their counterpart BS models.  This is expected \nsince the delta values generated by CS models are consistently higher than those of \nBS models (for example the median delta values of PconBS  for AggTs is 0.632 whilst \nfor PconCS  is 0.697), making CS based trading more aggressive. Moreover, CS with {av} \nand {avT} volatility measures, outperforms significantly the equivalent BS models \nsince it generates more than twice the number of trades; this may happen because \nunlike the BS models whose implied volatility changes more smoothly, CS models \nimplied skewness and kurtosis can change more erratically. Secondly, and for the \nsame reason, CS models under 0.2% or 0.4% transaction costs become inferior to \ntheir BS counterparts. Thirdly, from unreported calculations we have seen that as d \nincreases we generally observe P&L to increase in a diminishing fashion indicating \nthat there is an optimal d for maximizing trading profits. Finally, trading \u201cin \naggregate\u201d positions leads to significant further savings on transaction costs.  \n[Tables 6-8, here] \n \n In Table 8 we present results for the trading strategies based on ANNs (only \nfor the hybrid models with time adjusted parameters). In general we observe similar \nresults to those of the parametric models. Contrary though to the parametric OPMs, \nthe ANNs offer significant improvement in the cases of less sophisticated parameter \nestimates. For example, *NhavBS  produces a P&L equal to 32,908 compared to a P&L \nequal to 14,088 in the case of PavBS . The best models provide profits in 77%-82% of \ntransactions (detailed figures not reported for brevity) using both the full and the \nreduced dataset. Finally, in the presence of transaction costs the BS based hybrid \nmodel with contract specific volatility is not only the best performing ANN model, but \nalso the overall best. A final observation is that the ability to generate profits even \n \n22\nunder a considerable level of transaction costs (we do not report here, but the best \nstrategies retained profitability even up to a level of 0.5% of transaction costs) \nprovides some evidence of inefficiency in these options markets. Our study however \nis not intended to be a test of market efficiency.  \n  \n6.1. Improving trading performance with the Chen and Johnson (1985) modified \nhedging approach \n \n We now extend the trading strategies by utilizing with all models the improved \nhedging scheme suggested by Chen and Johnson (1985). This is a widely neglected \n(see Roon et al., 1998 for a rare exception in the use of parametric models) approach \nthat deals with deriving hedge parameters under the assumption of mispriced \noptions. According to this hedging scheme and when an option is mispriced, the \ndelta hedge parameter, ,\nk\nm t\u0394 , should be derived in a different way. If a mispriced \noption has been identified, then the riskless hedge will not earn r, the riskless rate, \nbut some other rate, r*. Chen and Johnson obtain the expression for a European call \noption that is the same as BS presented in Equations 1, 1.a and 1.b, by replacing r \nwith r*.  In order to derive the correct hedge ratio, Equation 1 must be solved \nnumerically for r* using the observed market price of cmrk (like retrieving the implied \ninterest rate). We implement this approach with the parametric BS and CS models, \nand the ANNs.  \n Finding the implied interest rate, r*, for the case of BS or CS is a simple \nnumerical task and we employ the repeated cubic interpolation technique according \nto Charalambous (1992). Finding the implied interest rate, r*, for ANNs is a more \ninvolved task, since in the case of hybrid models we need to jointly optimize with \nrespect to the interest rate input to the neural networks and to the interest rate in \nthe parametric model that is used to create the hybrid target function; this \nintroduces many jagged ridge regions in the optimization surface. Thus, in the case \nof hybrid ANNs we adopt a more computationally intensive methodology according to \nwhich we again use the cubic interpolation technique with ten different initial \nstarting points. \n After finding r* for all models considered we rerun the trading strategies. \nResults for the parametric BS and CS models appear in Panel B of Tables 6 and 7. \nThe most important observation is that before transaction costs are accounted for, in \nall BS models under consideration there is a slight (only) improvement in their \nprofitability (P&L). Under aggregate 0.4% transaction costs and for d = 15%, the \nimprovement in 60\nPBS  is about 19%, in PvixBS  is surprisingly about 164% and for the \n \n23\nmore sophisticated PconBS  model only 1.67%. We remind that \nP\nvixBS  exhibited both, \nthe poorest out-of-sample pricing performance and only a modest profitability (under \n0.4% transaction costs) among the BS models. Under the adjusted deltas, this seems \nto be partly alleviated. Somewhat similar results we observe for the semi-parametric \nCS model. For both parametric models, the modified hedging approach under \ntransaction costs gave the best results when using the average (not contract specific) \nparameters. In the case of ANNs (results unreported for brevity) and under no \ntransaction costs, we also observe a slight tendency for increased performance, but \nthe results are mixed. With transaction costs the technique was unable to improve \nthe profitability of ANNs. The above observations refer to the full dataset, but they \nalso hold for the reduced one (again not reported due to brevity). \n A general observation for the use of the modified hedging approach in trading \nstrategies is that it significantly improves trading performance when it is applied \nwith OPM models under assumptions consistent with the assumptions under which \nthis approach was developed. Thus, it performs well with the parametric models \nwhen either historical, or average implied parameters are used. The use of this \napproach did not reverse our previous findings about the best performing models \nwhen trading in the presence of transaction costs. Still, it demonstrated that simple \nmodels can be efficient alternatives to the more sophisticated and computationally \nintensive hybrid ANN methods. \n \n6.2. Delta hedging \n \nWe have also considered hedging as a testing tool. Our results here coincide \nwith previous literature \u2013 model ranking may differ if testing is based on hedging \ninstead of pricing. Bakshi et al. (1997) compare alternative parametric models and \nstate that the hedging-based ranking of the models is in sharp contrast with that \nobtained based on out-of-sample pricing. They also state that (delta-hedging) \nperformance is virtually indistinguishable among models. Quite similar results are \nreported in papers where non-parametric methods were used, like Garcia and \nGencay (2000), and Gencay and Qi (2001). Schittenkopf and Dorffner (2001) find the \nresults (marginally) better for the parametric models, but practically \nindistinguishable. Hutchison et al. (1994) also report that the learning networks they \nuse have a better hedging performance compared to BS but they find it difficult to \ninfer which network type performs best. We attribute this difference of model ranking \nto the fact that models are usually optimized with respect to pricing. An exception is \nCarverhill and Cheuk (2003) who focus more on hedging performance by optimizing \n \n24\nwith respect to the hedge parameters. Optimizing the \u201chedging performance\u201d is \nbeyond the scope of our paper. Furthermore, hedging performance is not a \nsubstitute for trading performance, since hedging tests fail to account for the \ndifference between overpriced and underpriced options. \n We have calculated the mean hedging error (MHE) and the mean absolute \nhedging error (MAHE) of a standard hedging strategy with daily rebalancing. For \nbrevity we do not report the full results here, but we have found according to MHE \nthat the best parametric model is the PconCS . Among the ANN models the best \nperforming one is *NhconCS , with an identical error for the parametric CS model (equal for \nboth models to 0.26). In addition, the error equals 0.30 for both the PconBS  and the \n*Nh\nconBS  models. In general, from the MHE we cannot tell which OPM is the best since \ntheir difference in this measure is practically indistinguishable. Continuing with the \nMAHE we have the same picture, and we find it hard to observe a certain OPM that \ndominates in this measure since many models have \u201calmost identical\u201d MAHE values. \nIt is true that PconBS  and \nP\navTBS 4  are the overall best models (with MAHE equal to \n2.57 for both) and perform relatively better than the ANN models (their hybrid ANN \ncounterparts both having an error equal to 2.63).  \n In general, we can conclude that the hedging error performance is not in line \nwith the models\u2019 pricing performance. That is, our best model in pricing accuracy, \n*Nh\nconBS , does not produce the smallest hedging errors. But again, it is truly hard to \ndifferentiate among models. The above discussion pertains to the full dataset, but we \nhave observed that ranking models using hedging performance is not affected by the \nchoice of dataset. \n \n \n7. Conclusions \n \n Our effort has focused in developing European option pricing and trading \ntools by combining the use of ANN methodology and information provided by \nparametric OPMs (the BS and the CS model). For our empirical tests we have used \nEuropean call options on the S&P 500 Index from January 1998 to August 2001. In \nour analysis we have included historical parameters, a VIX volatility proxy derived by \nweighting implied volatilities (for the case of BS only), and implied parameters (an \noverall average, an average per maturity, the 4-point closest in moneyness, and a \ncontract-specific parameter set). Neural networks are optimized using a modified \nLevenberg-Marquardt training algorithm. We include in the analysis simple ANNs \n(with input supplemented by historical or implied parameters specific either to BS or \n \n25\nthe CS model), and hybrid ANNs that in addition use pricing information derived by \nany of the two parametric models. In order to check the robustness of the results, in \naddition to our full dataset we repeat the analysis using a reduced dataset (following \nHutchison et al., 1994). The economic significance of the models is investigated \nthrough trading strategies with transaction costs. Instead of naive trading strategies \nwe implement improved (dynamic and cost-effective) ones. Furthermore, we also \nrefine these strategies with the Chen and Johnson (1985) modified hedging \napproach. Our results can be synopsized as follows:  \n  \n Regarding the in-sample pricing, CS performs better than the BS model (with \nthe exception of the case of the contract specific implied parameters that practically \neliminate the pricing error). \n Regarding out-of-sample pricing, CS outperforms BS with the use of average \nimplied parameters, but BS is still a better model when the contract specific implied \nparameters are used; in general, implied parameters lead to better performance than \nthe historical ones or the VIX volatility proxy; the simple neural networks cannot \noutperform the parametric models in the full range of data, but we verified \nallegations to the contrary found in the literature with the use of a reduced data set; \nhybrid neural networks that combine both neural network technology and the \nparametric models provide the best performance, especially when contract specific \nand adjusted parameters are used.  The BS based hybrid ANN (with contract specific \nparameters) is the overall best performer, and the equivalent CS hybrid often a good \nalternative. \n In trading and before transaction costs, models using contract specific implied \nparameters provide the best performance. But they also lead to the highest number \nof trades. In trading when transaction costs are accounted for in a naive manner, \nprofits practically in all cases disappear. In trading and even with 0.4% transaction \ncosts, when dynamic cost-efficient strategies are implemented, profits are still \nfeasible hinting thus to potential market inefficiencies. The parametric BS with \ncontract specific volatility is the best among the parametric models. The hybrid ANN \nbased on BS with contract specific volatility is the overall best. \n Implementing the widely neglected Chen and Johnson (1985) modified \nhedging approach, improves significantly the profitability of trading strategies that \nare based on the parametric models with average implied parameters (the models \nmore consistent with the assumptions behind the modified hedging approach). This \napproach did not affect the choice of the overall best model in terms of trading with \ntransaction costs. But it did demonstrate that reasonable alternatives for trading do \nexist without the need to resort to the extra sophistication of ANN technology. \n \n26\nReferences \n \nAndersen, T.G., Benzoni, L., Lund, J., 2002.
