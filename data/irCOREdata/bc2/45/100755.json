Fuhrer et al.10 constructed a\nnonvolatile charge storage memory element using a high-\nmobility \u00019000 cm2\/V s\u0002 semiconducting single-walled car-\nbon nanotube \u0001SWNT\u0002 \u00012.7 nm in diameter\u0002 based transistor.\nAs the gate voltage was swept back and forth between +10\nand \u221210 V, a large hysteresis was observed in the curves of\nthe drain current versus gate voltage at room temperature.\nThe threshold gate voltage at which the nanotube began to\nconduct was shifted by more than 6 V. The retention time of\nthe charge memory effect of their CNTFETs exceeded\n5000 s. Radosavljevic et al.11 reported an air-stable n-type\nCNTFET with a similar hysteresis phenomenon and the bit\nstorage time of at least 16 h at room temperature. Cui et al.12\npresented molecular memory devices fabricated using semi-\nconducting SWNTs. Charge storage was achieved by sweep-\ning the gate voltage in the range of \u00b15 V, associated with a\nstorage stability of at least 12 days at room temperature. A\nsignificant threshold voltage shift, combined with a long\ncharge retention time, is the prerequisite for memory devices.\nHowever, for practical applications, the performance of\nCNTFET memory devices needs to be further improved es-\npecially in terms of their long-term stability. To date, little\nsystematic work has been reported on the charge storage sta-\nbility of the CNTFET memory. In this letter, we report the\nfabrication of memory devices using 1.8 nm diameter\nSWNTs, employing a simple two-stage annealing process in-\nvolving hydrogen and air treatment which resulted in good\nmemory characteristics with a pronounced hysteresis which\nwas stable for at least 14 days.\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ns.wang@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2005\/87\u000213\u0001\/133117\/3\/$22.50 87, 13311\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

A 200-nm-thick SiO2 layer was thermally\ngrown on the top of the Si substrate, annealed at 150 \u00b0C for\n0.5 h in a hydrogen atmosphere. The electrodes were fabri-\ncated using 10-nm-thick titanium \u0001Ti\u0002 and 90-nm-thick gold\n\u0001Au\u0002, and were patterned on the SiO2\/Si substrate using a\nconventional lift-off process. The SWNTs used in this work\nwere grown by an arc-discharge technique in the form of\nsoot. SWNT soot was sonicated in dichloroethane to produce\nindividual SWNTs. A droplet of SWNT suspension was then\nspin coated onto the SiO2\/Si substrate which contained pre-\ndefined Au\/Ti contact patterns. The metallic SWNTs were\nselectively burned by current induced oxidation.13 Following\nthe oxidation procedure we were able to select a single, well\nbridged SWNT that contacted both the source and the drain\nelectrodes, while removing other nanotubes from this struc-\nture using an atomic force microscope \u0001AFM\u0002 in a contact\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 Schematic diagram of the CNTFET structure.

Figure 1\u0001b\u0002\nshows an AFM image of one of the investigated CNTFET\nsamples. One can see that a SWNT bridges the two gold\nelectrodes, which correspond to the source \u0001S\u0002 and the drain\n\u0001D\u0002, respectively. The SWNT functioned as a conducting\nchannel, with a channel length of 800 nm. The diameter of a\nsingle SWNT was around 1.8 nm measured using a JEOL\n2010 transmission electron microscope \u0001TEM\u0002.\nA HP-4156B precision semiconductor parameter ana-\nlyzer was used to measure the transfer characteristics of the\nCNTFETs at ambient conditions. Figure 2 shows the transis-\ntor characteristics \u0001Ids\u2212Vds\u0002 of the as-fabricated CNTFETs.\nOne can observe that the forms of the Ids\u2212Vds plots change\nby increasing the gate voltage from \u22128 to 8 V. The channel\nconductance decreases as the gate voltage Vg becomes more\npositive, indicating a p-type channel. The hole mobility,\nwhich was determined by assuming the classical FET\nmodel,14 is found to be \u0005500 cm2\/V s even at a large 1 V\nsource-drain potential. This value is higher than that of\n20 cm2\/V s reported by Martel et al.. for SWNTs,2 whereas\nlower than that of 9000 cm2\/V s, which was obtained by\nFuhrer et al.10\nFigure 3 presents Ids\u2212Vg data which were taken at room\ntemperature with Vds=1 V applied to the source electrode for\ngate voltage sweeps of \u22124 to +4,\u22126 to +6, and \u221210 to\n+10 V, respectively. Pronounced hysteresis loops, which re-\nflect memory effects, are clearly observed in the drain cur-\nrent versus the gate voltage, and the hysteresis loops were\nfound to be reproducible. The corresponding threshold volt-\nage shifts, defined as the shift of the gate voltage at which\nIds=5 nA, which can also be considered as the memory win-\ndow of the device, are 2.3, 3.8, and 6.7 V, respectively. This\nreflects that the charge storage capabilities of the device in-\ncrease with increasing gate voltage sweep ranges. The\nmemory effects are suggested to be originated from the\ncharge traps in the underlying SiO2\/Si substrate at room\ntemperature. TEM observation indicated that the diameter of\nour SWNT was only 1.8 nm, such a small diameter SWNT\ncan cause a highly localized electric field at the nanotube\nsurface.10,11 Charges are therefore easily reversibly injected\nFIG. 2.

This characteristic makes the CNTFETs\npossible to function as nonvolatile charge storage\nmemories.10,12 In order to improve the memory performance,\na CNTFET with a charge storage node is under construction.\nOur observation that a larger gate voltage sweep range leads\nto a larger threshold voltage shift might be due to an increase\nin the amount of charges stored in the dielectric with increas-\ning injected charges from the SWNT channel.\nIn the roadmap of nonvolatile memories, besides the\nthreshold voltage shifts, the charge storage stability \u0001reten-\ntion time\u0002 is another very important factor for their practical\napplications. However, little attention has been paid to this\nsubject for the CNTFET memory to date. In order to improve\nthe charge storage stability of the CNTFETs, a two-stage\nannealing process was employed. The first annealing stage\nwas applied using hydrogen, after the growth of the SiO2.\nThe second stage was carried out on the completed CNT-\nFETs in air. Figure 4 shows the retention characteristic of the\nCNTFETs with and without the annealing treatment at a tem-\nperature of 22\u00b12 \u00b0C.

One can see that\nfor the two-stage annealed CNTFET, as shown in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002,\nthe threshold voltage shifts show little variation over a period\nof more than 14 days at room temperature. In contrast, for\nthe CNTFET without annealing treatment, as shown in Fig.\n4\u0001b\u0002, one can observe that the threshold voltage shifts ini-\ntially decrease after 2.5 days, then reach a steady value and\nfinally decrease again after a further 8 days. Similar short-\nterm degradation in threshold voltage shift has previously\nbeen reported on non-annealed CNTFET devices.15 Figure 4\nindicates that the two-stage annealing process can effectively\nimprove the charge storage stability of CNTFETs.\nChoi et al.16 measured the drain current as a function of\ntime at 5 K. They observed that the current was stable for a\nperiod of 100 s. Lee et al.17 and Yang et al.15 held their\nCNTFET device at zero gate voltage, and the device main-\ntained a hysteresis loop for at least 7 days. Cui et al.12 re-\nported a CNTFET memory device with a storage stability of\nat least 12 days at room temperature. Compared to the re-\nported CNTFET memory devices, our two-stage annealed\ndevices show a higher charge storage stability. We attribute\nthis higher stability to the effect of the two-stage annealing\nprocess carried out on the devices in hydrogen and air. On\nthe one hand, annealing in hydrogen is believed to efficiently\npassivate the interface traps and generate the lower interface\ntrap density,18,19 therefore resulting in a slow degradation of\nthe threshold voltage and drain current. On the other hand,\nannealing in air could remove the physisorption solvent ele-\nments such as water and alcohol molecules15 at the nano-\ntubes, besides, it can also reduce the interface trap density,20\nleading to an enhancement of the charge storage stability.\nThe detailed mechanism needs to be studied further.\nIn conclusion, distinct hysteresis was clearly observed at\nthe curves of the drain current against gate voltage of carbon\nnanotube-based field-effect transistors. The threshold voltage\nshift values are found to increase with increasing gate volt-\nage sweep ranges. The device also exhibits high charge stor-\nage stability with a storage retention time of more than 14\ndays. A two-stage annealing process in hydrogen and air is\nbelieved to be responsible for the improvement of the storage\nstability.
