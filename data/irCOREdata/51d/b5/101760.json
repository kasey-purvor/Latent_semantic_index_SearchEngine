AI appears relevant to contemporary themes in literature on \nschool improvement such as self-evaluation, capacity-building and distributed forms of \nleadership.  \n \nAppreciative inquiry is introduced and its literature reviewed, with reference to its growing \nuse both in business and in American schools. The authors then report on `Imagine \nMeadfield1\u2019, the first known large-scale appreciative inquiry undertaken in an English \nsecondary school, with particular reference to the experience of the head teacher (first author) \nwho led this process. The article critically reviews this experience in order to assess the \npotential of AI for school improvement.   \n \n \n \nKEYWORDS: appreciative inquiry, school improvement, organisational change, self-\nevaluation, distributed leadership. \n                                                 \n1 pseudonym \n 2\n \nSchool Improvement \n \nSchool improvement is a vast and contentious theme; Flecknoe (2001:217) acknowledges \nthat: \u2018School improvement has had many meanings over the years.\u2019 Creemers and Reezigt \n(2005:359) note the different origins of interest in school effectiveness and school \nimprovement, the latter being` practice and policy oriented and intended to change education \nin the desired direction.\u2019 Hopkins et al (1994:3) propose the following definition, which \nsimilarly emphasises school improvement as a form of practice:  \n \n\u2018A distinct approach to educational change that enhances student outcomes as well as \nstrengthening the school\u2019s capacity for managing change\u2026 raising student achievement \nthrough focusing on the teacher-learning process and the conditions which support it\u2026. \nImproving the school\u2019s capacity for providing quality education in times of change.\u2019  \n \nOur perspective on school improvement arises through an interest in examining the nature and \neffects of strategies used in pursuit of organisational change (e.g. Author B and Nicholls \n2000). Appreciative inquiry, which we introduce below, originates in the field of \norganisational development (Sorensen et al, 2000) and is an example of a strategy for change \nthat is beginning to appear in education. It is therefore relevant to review its potential for \nschool improvement. \n \nIn England, the locus of this article\u2019s case study, strategies for school improvement include \nofficial endeavours - notably the school inspection regime of the Office for Standards in \nEducation (Ofsted) \u2013 as well as informal. While this article is concerned with an informal, \npractice-focused strategy for school improvement, it is relevant to note a developing emphasis \non self-evaluation in the stance of official school inspection (e.g. MacBeath 1999, 2002; \n 3\nOfsted 2006), which is regarded as a contributing to capacity-building for sustained school \nimprovement. According to Cribb (2002:30), in the early years the focus of Ofsted, the \nEnglish school inspection body, its focus was \u2018firmly on the process of inspection\u2019. However, \ntowards the end of the first round of inspections, Ofsted (1998, 1999) developed a programme \nof self-evaluation for all schools to use. \n \nCribb (2002:33) believes that: \u2018The Ofsted Framework for Inspection provided a powerful \nway of getting into the process of reflection and self evaluation\u2019, and that many schools have \nnow moved to \u2018a more sophisticated model that reflects other aspects including the ethos of \nthe school; the quality of relationships; the views of stakeholders including pupils of all ages; \ninclusion and the drive to improve teaching to enable all learners to participate in mainstream \nschools.\u2019 \n \nMacBeath (2002:55) argues that inspection \u2018cannot achieve what \u201crigorous\u201d self-evaluation \ncan achieve\u2019, and writes that: \u2018When schools truly know themselves they move to a \nheightened level of organisational intelligence and they develop a capacity that lies at the very \nheart of improvement.\u2019 He suggests that rigorous self-evaluation is concerned with: \n \n\u2022 \u2018The hopes and aspirations of pupils and how well these hopes and aspirations have \nbeen met; \n\u2022 The professional fulfilment of teachers; \n\u2022 The quality of relationships which can either promote or inhibit learning; \n\u2022 The breadth of opportunities offered and the equality of access to them; \n\u2022 Accessibility to parents and openness to the community; \n\u2022 The school\u2019s resilience and responsiveness as an organisation, its capacity for \nchange.\u2019 \n(MacBeath, 2002:54) \n 4\n \nMacBeath (2005:6) refers to the purpose of school improvement as `to build the school\u2019s \ncapacity to respond to and manage change.\u2019 Other related notions that emphasise the \ncontribution of participation to capacity building include the `intelligent organisation\u2019 \n(Bowring-Carr and West-Burnham 1997) and the `citizenship school\u2019 (Alexander 2002), \nmatching the emphasis of the framework for \u2018world class\u2019 school improvement on \u2018enhancing \nthe learning experiences of pupils\u2019 (Specialist Schools Trust, 2003:4). Harber and Trafford \n(1999:46) state that \u2018students in effective schools are treated with dignity and encouraged to \nparticipate in the organisation of the school\u2026 and as a result they feel valued.\u2019 Nightingale \n(2003:18) suggests that \u2018not only is it advisable to give students the freedom to take \nresponsibility for a far wider slice of school life\u2026it is essential that they do so if their \neducation is to succeed.\u2019   \n \nThe potential of self-evaluation is also contested. Devos and Verhoeven (2003:405), for \nexample, question whether \u2018schools can meet these high expectations\u2019, asking whether it is \npossible for a school \u2018to reflect in an unbiased way on its own practice and to take actions \nconsistent with its reflections?\u2019 \n \nIn contemporary discourse, notions of school improvement are linked consistently to that of \nleadership. Harris (2004:11), noting that the influence of leadership on school improvement \nappears powerful but indirect, argues that `distributed forms of leadership can assist capacity \nbuilding within schools which contributes to school improvement\u2019. Rather than emphasising \nthe formal leadership of headteachers, distributed leadership is a participative endeavour \n(Bush and Glover 2003) that `resides in the human potential to be released within an \norganization\u2019 (Harris 2004:12).  \n \nHowever, Harris also highlights the predominance of advocacy over evidence in relation to \ndistributed forms of leadership, a point echoed by others (Hopkins 2001; Hopkins and \n 5\nJackson 2002; Woods et al 2004). Svedberg (2004) and Woods et al (2004) remind us that \nnotions such as distributed leadership need to be considered as discursive devices as well as \ndescriptions of, or prescriptions for, practice.  \n \nThere appears therefore to be a substantial contemporary emphasis on capacity-building for \nschool improvement through self-evaluation, participation, and distributed leadership. Noting \nthe cautions expressed in the literature and the need for critical reflection, we now turn to \nconsider appreciative inquiry (AI), an innovative strategy for change that appears compatible \nwith this emphasis. \n \n \nAppreciative Inquiry  \n \nAI was originally developed by David Cooperrider at Case Western Reserve University \n(Cooperrider and Srivastva 1987;  Cooperrider 1990; Cooperrider and Pasmore 1991; \nSrivastva and Cooperrider 1999; Cooperrider and Whitney 1999; Cooperrider et al 2000). It is \nrepresented in both academic literature (Srivastva and Barrett 1988; Ludema et al 1997) and \npractitioner literature (Hammond 1996; Elliott 1999; Watkins and Mohr 2001). \n \nAccording to Ashford and Patkar (2001:4): \u2018Appreciative inquiry\u2026 is a strategy for \npurposeful change that identifies the best of \u201cwhat is\u201d to pursue dreams and possibilities of \n\u201cwhat could be.\u201d It is a cooperative search for the strengths, passions and life-giving forces \nthat are found within every system \u2013 those factors that hold the potential for inspired, positive \nchange.\u2019  \n \nSchiller et al (2001:2) provide a number of case studies that illustrate how leaders of \norganisations around the world have used AI. Watkins and Mohr (2001) report case studies of \nthe use of AI within different types of company such as NASA, Avon and British Airways, \n 6\nand Vanstone (2004) describes AI as used in BP. It is also known as a community \ndevelopment methodology, notably through \u2018Imagine Chicago\u2019, which involved hundreds of \nresidents in developing the future of the city of Chicago (Browne, 2001). \u2018Imagine Chicago\u2019 \nhas seeded many other community and organisational projects across the world, hence the \ntitle of the improvement process described in this article. \n \nVarious authors, mainly in the USA, have written about the use of AI in schools. Schiller \nsuggests that AI can \u2018re-form our positive images of schools into positive actions\u2019 (2003:2). \nPratt describes how an AI project in an urban school in Ohio has been used \u2018to promote \npositive cultural change and to improve the learning environment\u2019 (2003:18). Hinrichs and \nRhodes-Yenowine (2003:20) describe a project that aimed to enhance student participation in \ncreating the school\u2019s strategic priorities through the use of \u2018the strength based whole systems \nmethodology\u2019 involving all stakeholders in the change process. Ricketts and Willis explain \nhow the integration of structured EL (experiential learning) activities and initiatives with the \nAI process \u2018is a powerful learning combination for schools\u2019 (2003:26). Unlike the present \narticle, these articles contain little detailed discussion of how each project has impacted on \nschool improvement.  \n \nWhat are the theoretical principles of AI? Watkins and Mohr (2001:26) say that Gergen\u2019s \nwork on social constructionism (e.g. Gergen 1978, 1982, 1994) `has had a major formative \nimpact on AI\u2019. Watkins and Mohr describe social constructionism as a postmodernist theory \n(distinct from the \u2018modernist\u2019 era typified by Newtonian thinking that believed there were \n\u2018underlying rules and structures that defined the \u201cright\u201d way of doing things\u2019). They also \ndescribe the influence of \u2018the New Sciences (quantum physics, chaos, complexity)\u2019 on AI.  \nCooperrider (cited in Schiller et al 2001:ix) states that he has become increasingly convinced \nthat \u2018appreciative modes of management may be to our newer, self-organising systems what \ndeficit or problem-oriented methods of management have been to command and control \nbureaucracy\u2019. The reference to self-organising systems again indicates a theoretical \n 7\norientation closer to that of complexity theory (e.g. Wheatley 1999; Stacey et al 2000) than of \nclassic Organisation Development (Bennis 1969). \n \nGergen argues that a \u2018broad cultural enfeeblement\u2019 (1994:148) arises from the application of \ncritical social science and that the resulting \u2018vocabularies of deficit\u2019 have become absorbed \ninto common organisational language, forming the basis for the construction of everyday \nreality. Thus Ludema et al (2001:191) explain that organisations have learnt \u2018how to be \ndeficient and problematic.\u2019 The result is that people in organisations \u2018gain an expert \nknowledge of what is \u201cwrong\u201d with their organisations.\u2019 AI counters this emphasis on deficit \nthrough its \u2018deliberately affirmative assumptions about people, organisations and \nrelationships\u2019 (Ludema et al 2001:191). It is predicated on a radical epistemological stance \nwhich assumes that, given the opportunity to do so, human systems will orientate towards that \nwhich is perceived to be positive and life-enhancing. It turns the problem-solving style of \n\u2018needs based\u2019 forms of inquiry on their head by focusing on achievements rather than \nproblems and seeking to foster enthusiastic and inspired participation.  \n \nAccording to Watkins and Mohr (2001:36), the essential ingredients of AI are, \u2018first, the \nbeliefs and values that are reflected in five core principles (constructionist, simultaneity, \nanticipatory, poetic and positive) and second, five core or generic processes\u2019. The five generic \nprocesses referred to by Watkins and Mohr (2001:40) comprise the 4-D cycle (see figure 1) \nwith an additional D (definition) that emphasises the crucial requirement for the inquiry to be \nframed in the positive. In practice, AI involves identifying `the best of what is\u2019 \u2013 that which \nenhances cultural identity, spirit and vision \u2013 in order to construct with the participants a \nvision of their desired future. They then achieve this vision by creating `provocative \npropositions\u2019, or \u2018possibility statements\u2019, that move the participants towards the realisation of \nthe vision.  \n \nInsert Figure 1 here  \n 8\n \nThe `4-D model\u2019 (Ludema et al 2001:192 \u2013 see figure 1), which forms the framework for the \nmajority of AI applications, moves from the \u2018discovery\u2019 phase (discovering the best of what \nis) through the \u2018dream\u2019 phase (dreaming of what might be), to the \u2018design\u2019 phase (designing \nwhat should be in an ideal future) and concludes at the \u2018delivery\u2019 phase (the sustaining and \nunderpinning of the changes undertaken). The cycle can then be repeated, and the users \ndecide how they wish to enter (and leave) the framework.  \n \nAI is an emergent practice, and the extent of critique is limited. Golembiewski, a respected \nauthor in the field of Organisation Development, refers to himself as an `external \n\u201cconstructive critic\u201d with respect to AI\u2019 (2000:56). He observes, for example, that AI has \nreceived little appreciative inquiry itself. Indeed the lack of evaluation is not peculiar to AI, it \nappears to be a feature of organisation development generally (e.g. Mirvis & Berg 1977). \nGolembiewski believes that AI overstates the rejection of all problem-solving approaches as \nbeing negative, ignoring the \u2018balance\u2019 that normally dominates these other approaches. There \nis a clear concern as to how it is possible to look appreciatively at a situation when there may \nbe problems that need addressing. Bushe (2000:108) appears to support Golembiewski\u2019s \nconcern, suggesting that 'although AI can be a truly revolutionary way in which we study and \nchange social systems\u2026 I think appreciation needs to be balanced with critical thinking to \nlead us there\u2019. It is open to debate whether a \u2018balanced\u2019 approach may inhibit the essential \nemphasis on amplifying the positive, and perhaps obstruct the energising atmosphere of the \nAI process.  \n \nWatkins and Mohr (2001:198) reply to this criticism by stating that `appreciative inquiry isn\u2019t \nabout focusing on the positive and denying the negative.\u2019 Elliott (1999:77) and Fernandez \n(IISD, 1999) further emphasise the importance of framing a project question in a style that \nleads onto an inspired response from participants emphasising strengths and successes, rather \nthan being in a \u2018problematic\u2019 style that presents a \u2018need\u2019 to be met. Watkins and Mohr \n 9\n(2001:53) emphasise the importance of choosing \u2018the positive as the focus of inquiry\u2019 and that \n\u2018the choice of focus will determine how the whole process will unfold\u2019 (2001:55); otherwise \n\u2018they will focus on the obstacles they face, the problems they have, the malfunctions that have \ncaused them to be in their current situation, and so on.\u2019  \n \nAs may be surmised from the above description, AI presents the prospect of being a radical \nalternative to problem-focused thinking, as well as (potentially) a discursive device to divert \nattention from what leaders or managers may define as `negative\u2019. In the next section we \ndescribe a qualitative, bounded case study that evaluated an AI project, in order to illustrate \nhow AI might contribute to self-evaluation and school improvement. \n \n \nThe Case Study \n \nThe aim of the research, undertaken for a doctoral programme (by Author A, 2004, \nsupervised by Author B), was to evaluate AI as a school improvement process. Author A \nhad become aware of AI through his postgraduate studies and through a public dialogue \nsession in London, where he met the Manager of Organisational Development and Learning \nfor BP (Samuels), who subsequently facilitated the project. The methodology was a \nqualitative, action-orientated, bounded case study (Stake 1995) to evaluate a real AI project \ntitled \u2018Imagine Meadfield\u2019 in the school at which the first author is head teacher.   \n \nStake (1995:95) believes that \u2018all evaluation studies are case studies\u2019, and Lincoln and Guba \n(1985:358) state that \u2018the case study format has certain characteristics that are especially \nadvantageous to the naturalistic inquirer.\u2019 Reviewing the strengths and limitations of case \nstudy design, Merriam (1988:33) explains how case study \u2018has proved particularly useful for \nstudying educational innovations, for evaluating programmes and for informing policy.\u2019 Here, \nthe AI was certainly an educational innovation.  \n 10\n \nThe study sought to investigate: \n1. What were the participants\u2019 reactions to, and experiences of, the AI? \n2. What appeared to be the significant features and outcomes of the AI for the school? \n3. What could be learnt from the AI about school improvement? \n \nIn the constructionist tradition, this study incorporated the paradigm assumptions of an \nemerging design, a context-dependent inquiry, and an inductive data analysis (Creswell, \n1998). The study was also bounded by time (14 months) and by a single case (the school \ncommunity). Consistent with case study design (Merriam, 1988; Stake, 1995; Yin, 1984), \nstudents and staff were identified as multiple sources of information for data collection that \nincluded illuminative interviews. These interviews involved a sample of staff and students \nwho had taken part in at least one of the \u2018Imagine Meadfield\u2019 summits (see below). This \nbounding of the study was consistent with an exploratory qualitative case study design (Yin, \n1984). Additional data comprised documents, artefacts (as shown on film), observation (again \ncaught on camera), video film and digital camera photographs, plus over 1000 appreciative \ninterview scripts and flip charts of the summit outcomes.  \n \n`Imagine Meadfield\u2019: the setting and process \n \nThe school is a mixed, 11-18, specialist College with 1350 students on roll, including a sixth \nform of 200 students, located in London\u2019s commuter belt. The majority of the students live \nwithin 3 miles of the school. The school itself had been over-subscribed for 12 years. During \nthis period it grew from having under 500 students to the current roll. \n  \nIn order to enhance the school\u2019s future, and as a deliberate effort to create distributed \nleadership (Harris, 2004), Author A was keen to actively involve students, staff and \ngovernors in a collaborative form of inquiry that would inform the future strategic planning \n 11\nfor the school. As head teacher, Author A had been discussing with the head of sixth form \nthe need to involve students and staff in drawing together the significant cultural \ncharacteristics of the current sixth form and using this information to shape its future. The \nhead of sixth form was keen to deploy a methodology that could involve the students as well \nas staff in the role of interviewers, or key inquirers, in order to engage a range of stakeholders \nin a collaborative process.  \n \nAs AI offered this opportunity, a pilot project to shape the future of the sixth form was \ninitiated (Adamson et al 2002). In this, staff and students together formed a shared image and \ndeveloped ideas collaboratively, with enthusiasm and laughter. The pilot AI seemed a very \npositive experience for all involved, such that, without prompting and within days of the pilot \nbeing completed, staff and students were asking Author A whether another project could be \norganised. The year 10 manager had been so impressed by the collective designs produced by \nthe staff and students that she wanted the same for the 240 students in her year. A subsequent \nplanning discussion decided to attempt a whole organisation AI, in similar style to \u2018Imagine \nChicago\u2019 (Browne, 2001). \n \n \nAs with the pilot, and following discussions with the Chairman of Governors, a core team was \nformed to take a strategic role in planning and implementing the proposed project. Author A \nfelt that this core team should consist of enthusiastic stakeholders - students and staff who \nwould feel empowered to collaboratively plan the proposed whole-school inquiry. This \nentailed some letting go of control on the head teacher\u2019s part; at the same time we note that \nthe recruitment of those perceived to be `enthusiasts\u2019 constitutes a form of political control \nover the voices most likely to be heard. \n \nOver the next few months, a core team of 12 students (a boy and girl from each year, except \nthe Upper Sixth who had exam commitments) plus 4 staff and Author A designed and \nimplemented the AI. A facilitator (Samuels) helped maintain the intended positive, \n 12\nappreciative focus, as the team developed a commitment to a search for strengths in the \nschool and avoided slippage into a \u2018problem solving' mode. This positive focus was reflected \nin the interview protocol (see figure 2), which the team developed and tested with other \nstudents and staff. \n \nInsert Figure 2 here  \n \nThe core team then moved on to plan the inquiry itself, using the 4-D model (figure 1). In \norder to generate maximum involvement, the group decided to seek a way to involve all \nstudents, staff and members of the Governing Body, subject to time, space and budgetary \nconstraints. As a result, 275 interviewers (4-5 interviews each), comprising 240 students and \n35 staff, were to conduct the interviews. The aim was to invite participation as interviewer or \nas a volunteer to be interviewed. There was no exclusion on the basis of enthusiasm or \nanything else, thus in this respect opportunity was created in principle for multiple student \nvoices to be heard. . \n \nSelection of the interviewers was through a process that ensured both proportional and equal \nopportunity representation across student ages, staff seniority and experience. This was \nachieved by a series of introductory talks at assemblies and staff briefings, followed by direct \napproach to those groups that were under represented, such as a group of year 10 students and \nsupport staff.  \n \nThe interviewers were then to participate in a one-day summit in the school sports hall, \ncomprising the discovery (of the best of Meadfield) and dream (the future of the school) \nphases of the AI. At the completion of the dream phase, all participants were invited to attend \nthe design phase, comprising two 2.5 hour summits. In all, about 45 participants were able to \nattend in order to consider what could be done to create the dream. All of this would be input \ninto the formal strategic planning process for the delivery phase. \n 13\n \nA student disappears \n \nNo sooner had everything been planned than tragedy struck. On the day before the school \nfinished for the Easter holiday, a female student disappeared without trace while on her \njourney home. From that date the school was at the centre of the police inquiry and under the \nmedia spotlight.  \n \nAt the start of the Summer term the core team met and were asked by Author A and Samuels \nhow they wanted to proceed with regard to the planned AI. The team unequivocally \nrecommended delaying the project until the Autumn. At that time Author A, as head teacher, \nwas prepared to accept that cancellation of the project might have been appropriate.  \nHowever, in the light of the clear commitment to the project by the core team, Author A \nconsulted at length with the inquiry facilitator as well as other senior staff and members of the \nGoverning Body. All agreed to support the recommendation of the core team, whose view \nthat the project should not be abandoned seemed to reflect the perspective of the whole school \ncommunity. \n \nCore team meetings continued. In June the team realised how useful it could be to interview \nsome of the staff and students who would be leaving. It was decided to conduct appreciative \nexit interviews in order to gain interview experience and to obtain data that could be included \nwith information from the main interviews (Author A et al 2003) .  \n \nAfter the Summer holidays the core team met and finalised plans for the AI, ready for an \nOctober start. However, it was then that the missing student\u2019s body was discovered. The \ninvestigation became a murder inquiry, and the school community sought to cope with the \nsadness and grief that resulted from this news. As head teacher, Author A was fully \ncommitted in dealing with the implications of this, including supporting her family.  \n 14\nUnderstandably, the trauma and uncertainty had placed the school community under immense \nstrain, with many students and staff deeply affected.  As a result of this tragic situation the \ndaily running of the school during the six-month period was delegated to the deputy head \nteacher.  \n \nWithin a few weeks a memorial service was held and the school community tried to come to \nterms with the preceding six months. After careful consultation about the revised timing of \nthe project with staff, students and Governors, the AI was then scheduled for the late Autumn. \nEven after what had been a significant delay, the core team had maintained their enthusiasm \nfor the project. Given the negativity that had understandably pervaded the school, the AI \nappeared to represent an opportunity for a more optimistic look at the future. Whether this \nalso mitigated against the surfacing of more challenging issues is difficult to say.  \n \n`Imagine Meadfield\u2019 begins: the discovery, dream and design phases   \n \nTo train interviewers for the inquiry, the 275 volunteers gathered one afternoon in the sports \nhall and received 90 minutes\u2019 instruction in the basic concepts of AI, followed by a practice \ninterview. All interviewers were then asked to complete between four and five appreciative \ninterviews in the next 10 days, which they would bring to the discovery and dream summits \n(see figure 3). Timetabled slots were created for the student interviews, and an after school \nsession was set aside for staff to interview other staff if they wished. \n \nInsert Figure 3 here  \n \nAll students and staff who had undertaken appreciative interviews then took part in the main \ndiscovery and dream summits in the sports hall. The remainder of the school (those not \ninvolved in the main summit) met in their tutor groups for a mini appreciative summit for part \nof the day. These \u2018mini-summits\u2019 consisted of a presentation to each year group by Author A, \n 15\nfollowed by time in tutor groups working through the following topics (chosen by the core \nteam as relevant and potentially useful to the inquiry):  \n\u2022 Rest and Recreation \n\u2022 Environment \n\u2022 Learning  \n\u2022 The image of the school.  \n \nThe data from the mini-summits \u2013 the wishes and images of those students not involved in the \nmain summit - were introduced into the design phase of the main summit.  \n \nAt the start of the discovery summit, interviewers were placed in groups of 10 around the \nsports hall. The groups explored what was \u2018underneath\u2019 the stories about Meadfield \u2018at its \nbest\u2019, using a flip chart to record important phrases. Each group then displayed their `themes \nand wishes\u2019 on the wall of the sports hall. All participants then walked around observing the \nthemes and noticing what people were \u2018wishing for\u2019 from all the groups. \n \nThe dream summit followed after lunch. Delegates were asked to visualise the school in 10 \nyears\u2019 time, as if the \u2018wishes\u2019 had come true. Groups of 8 were asked to share their images, \nand then to create together a physical representation of these images in any form the group \nfelt was appropriate to present their \u2018dreams\u2019 to everyone else in the hall. As well as using \npaint and coloured materials, one group sang their vision, another group presented a poem and \none group took the assembled audience on a \u2018virtual tour\u2019 of the future school.  \n \nThe enthusiastic applause that greeted each presentation seemed (to Author A) genuine and \nhighly respectful of each presenter. Author A\u2019s impression was that the AI was not only \nproducing ideas for the future but also generating much commitment to continued \ninvolvement in developing those ideas. \n 16\n \nBefore everyone departed at the end of the dream summit everyone present was invited to the \ndesign summits (see figure 3) that were already fixed to take place on two after-school \nsessions. Many said that they could not come owing to prior commitments. However, a total \nof forty-five students and staff attended the two sessions. The objective of the design summits \nwas to explore what would have to change in order to make those images become real.  \n \nFor the design summits, all the dreams from the main summit had been clustered (by Samuels \nand other members of the core team) into themes, such as \u2018communication\u2019, and placed on the \nwalls of the sixth form centre. When the delegates arrived they were asked to move to stand \nby the theme that interested them. This formed work groups whose task was to translate the \ndreams and visual images into short prose statements called (in AI) `provocative propositions\u2019 \nor \u2018possibility statements\u2019. Watkins and Mohr (2001:141) describe possibility statements as \u2018a \nset of unique statements that paint a picture of the group\u2019s vision of the organisation\u2019s most \ndesired future.\u2019  \n \nOne example of a possibility statement produced at the summit, under the theme of \n\u2018Atmosphere\u2019, was:  \n \nStudents and staff always aim to work towards higher standards than they ever imagined \npossible giving them a sense of achievement. We are all backed up and encouraged by \nsupport from others and are given advice based on each others\u2019 knowledge that we share \ntogether. With everyone\u2019s inputs the ideas that were once just ideas in brief soon get put into \npractice and achieved. \n \nBy the end of the second evening the groups produced a number of different possibility \nstatements, each of which would be incorporated into the strategic planning for the school.  \n \n 17\nThe Delivery Phase \n \nFor the delivery phase the project findings were organised into areas for development. These \nareas, which had been identified prior to the design summit as already described, included:  \n\u2022 Atmosphere and expectations; \n\u2022 Learning and opportunities; \n\u2022 Resources and facilities; \n\u2022 Communication; \n\u2022 Community partnership. \n \nAuthor A wanted the results of the project to become embedded in the strategic planning for \nthe school. Certain points from the AI provided useful information on the school culture, and \npossible direction for change, which could have been omitted from the planning process by \nsenior staff, however well-meaning, who had not had in-depth involvement in the project. \nThis perhaps highlights an aspect of the radical potential of AI, through reducing the \nlikelihood that students\u2019 ideas will be discounted or censored by staff. \n \nThe Chair and Vice Chair of Governors agreed that all governors would be fully briefed on \nthe outcomes from the inquiry; the Governors then accepted the recommendation from the \nChair that all the outcomes from the AI would inform the strategic planning process for the \nschool. The Governing Body linked each of the areas for development with an existing \nGovernors\u2019 committee and arranged for links with student council and other focus groups to \nfacilitate the development of each area. In addition, each area formed a part of the school \nimprovement plan and so would link directly into the formal strategic planning process. \n \nIn summary, by involving over 1000 members of the school community, \u2018Imagine Meadfield\u2019 \ncreated shared images for the future and produced over 200 ideas and wishes. These ideas and \nwishes have led to changes including the following: \n 18\n \n\u2022 Students can now drink water in lessons (without needing the permission of the \nmember of staff); \n\u2022 A playground has been set aside for quiet sitting and conversation. A member of staff \nhas obtained sponsorship for seats and plants to enhance the attractiveness of the area. \nIn addition a memorial garden has been completed; \n\u2022 Various changes have been made to the school uniform; \n\u2022 To improve communication in the school, a company has donated a plasma screen \nthat is used in the main school foyer in order to present school news and updates on \ndaily routines; \n\u2022 The student council now meets even more regularly than before;  \n\u2022 A large hard standing area has been built on the field, providing a much needed \nadditional playing and match area; \n\u2022 Significant decoration and refurbishment is taking place to improve the condition of \nthe school building. \n \n \nEvaluation of the Case Study  \n \nThis section considers the results from the AI and briefly relates these to descriptors from \nMacBeath\u2019s self-evaluation framework (2002:54). Following this, we reflect critically on the \nAI process.  \n \nThree main themes emerged from the research:  \n\u2022 The inspired responses at the summits of the students and staff who were taking part \nin the inquiry; \n\u2022 AI as a means of unlocking the door to culture and the learning environment; and \n\u2022 The development of a collaborative change strategy. \n 19\n \nInspired responses at the summits \nA member of staff remarked that he felt the inquiry had been \u2018very positive, especially the big \nsummit.\u2019 He also commented that: \u2018If I think back to how we felt at the end of that, there was \na big high with lots of energy, lots of good ideas.\u2019 Another member of staff explained how \nshe noticed that: \u2018The enthusiasm of the students was best\u2019, adding that \u2018it was very \ninfectious.\u2019 A third member of staff involved in the entire AI commented : \u2018I realise now that \nseeing the positive does give more energy for change and bring forward ideas.\u2019  \n \nA fourth member of staff added that: \u2018It was amazing really.\u2019 She continues: \u2018We had the \nwhole school involved. The idea is amazing \u2013 to get the whole school giving their input into \nwhat we can do with our school.\u2019 She also commented: \u2018It was so rewarding to be part of the \ndream phase and to see the realisation that \u2018we can make a difference\u2019 and then moving to \nconsider how to mobilise in order to make it happen.\u2019 \n \nWhilst enthusiasm per se is insufficient as a measure of effectiveness, comments such as \nthose above indicate that the AI process inspired those involved and created a positive \nenvironment from which creative ideas were generated.  \n \nUnlocking the door to culture and the learning environment \nAsking students and staff for stories that illustrated the school at its best produced significant \ndata about the strengths of the school and its culture. Examples included: \n \n\u2022 The good teacher:  friendly and helpful, support and encouragement given, \nunderstanding and approachable, enthusiastic, make you feel confident, motivated;  \n\u2022 The conditions that enhance a rich learning environment : Student \u2013 teacher bond, \nstudents and teachers get on well, mentors and peer supporters, students support each \n 20\nother, mistakes are OK, rewards and praise, exciting teaching methods, respect for \nothers, caring community, team spirit; \n\u2022 The physical environment: Safe, respect for our environment, no litter, bright, \ncoloured walls, more displays. \n \nThe AI also revealed aspects of the culture that appeared unique and were perceived to \ncontribute to the success of the school. For example, one of the staff highlighted \u2018the value of \nrelationships between students and staff.\u2019 In addition, the same member of staff remarked \nabout the value of the \u2018non formal teaching time such as the bits of time around lesson time.\u2019  \n \nThe importance that students placed on experiential learning, as advocated by Ricketts and \nWillis (2003), within a positive, supportive culture emerged as a key issue. They particularly \nvalued the opportunities for residential and day trips as part of the enrichment of the \ncurriculum. The students also valued the theme days and being able to take part in activities \nsuch as sport, music and arts festivals. \n \nDeveloping a collaborative change strategy \nOne member of staff, having been involved throughout the inquiry, commented on the \ncollaborative and participative process: \u2018It realises the ability of students to strategically plan \nalongside staff\u2019, adding that he believes \u2018it gives a voice as well as confidence.\u2019 He proposed \nthat the process \u2018is a new change strategy as a result of which a holistic picture is developed \nthat creates energy, momentum and ownership for change\u2019 and which produces a \u2018really \npowerful mandate for change.\u2019  \n \nThe atmosphere created in the discovery and dream summits appeared to inspire those taking \npart into realising that they could \u2018make a difference\u2019 and resulted in suggestions that \nappeared to be owned strongly by those involved. A number of participants spoke of the \n 21\n\u2018buzz\u2019 that was created in the main hall, and how rewarding it was to be part of a process in \nwhich everyone worked together.  \n \nSeveral members of staff who were involved spoke of the expectation that things would \nchange and commented on the importance of participants being aware of the changes being \nmade as a result of the inquiry. One participant added, \u2018I\u2019d like changes to come about \nbecause of what\u2019s happened. Otherwise the whole impetus and positive atmosphere will be \nlost and become a major disappointment.\u2019 \n \nThose attending the dream summit had become very motivated to create and plan the school \nof the future. In parallel with this enthusiasm and energy was an expectation that these ideas \nand plans would be implemented. The study revealed that staff and students strongly valued \nbeing \u2018listened to\u2019, as they were involved in conversations and discussions about the school. \nThis finding is supported by Nightingale (2003:22) who reports that: \u2018Involvement in \nconferences and workshops encourages students\u2019 skills, confidence and understanding.\u2019  \n \nIn summary, in relation to MacBeath\u2019s (2002:54) framework of descriptors on capacity for \nschool improvement, there appears to be evidence that `Imagine Meadfield\u2019 impacted upon: \n \n\u2022 The hopes and aspirations of pupils and how well these hopes and aspirations have \nbeen met; \n\u2022 The quality of relationships which can either promote or inhibit learning; \n\u2022 The breadth of opportunities offered and the equality of access to them; \n\u2022 The school\u2019s resilience and responsiveness as an organisation, its capacity for change. \n \n 22\nAuthor A\u2019s personal view is that while AI does not offer a complete substitute for an \ninspection process, `Imagine Meadfield\u2019 was worthwhile, with benefits for school \nimprovement including: \n \n\u2022 more active involvement of staff and students in the decision-making within the \nschool; \n\u2022 the alignment of student ideas and aspirations with the formal strategic planning \nprocess for the school; \n\u2022 grounding the self-review process on the learning experiences of students; \n\u2022 identifying and influencing the school\u2019s culture;  \n\u2022 tangible improvements to the school\u2019s environment and facilities; \n\u2022 accelerating the school\u2019s capacity to implement change; \n\u2022 gaining an awareness of how well staff and students\u2019 hopes and aspirations are being \nmet. \n \nCritical Evaluation  \nThe epistemological emphasis of AI on the positive should not be taken to imply that AI in \npractice offers a non-contentious strategy for change that circumvents dissent or \norganisational politics. Equally, AI may also operate in a relatively conservative manner, \nappearing to offer more radical potential than it delivers. As Harris  points out: \u2018It would be \nna\u00efve to ignore the major structural, cultural and micro-political barriers operating in schools \nthat make distributed forms of leadership difficult to implement\u2019 (Harris 2004:19). \n \nThe process by which the AI attempted to involve all stakeholders in a \u2018level playing field\u2019 of \ncollaborative strategic planning and review, revealed that a number of staff were \nuncomfortable at the prospect. The reaction to the inquiry by certain members of staff \nindicated a perceived threat to their authority and concern over apparently relinquishing \n 23\npower to other staff and even students. For example, one member of staff expressed his \nconcern that the acceptance of certain proposals emerging from the inquiry was a case of \n\u2018management \u201cgiving in\u201d to students\u2019 (Author A, 2004:113). In this respect, `Imagine \nMeadfield\u2019, opened up some challenge to existing structures of power and privilege and \nillustrates the potential for hostility to distributed leadership noted by Harris (2004:21).  \n \nWhilst encouragement for listening to the student voice appears to be developing apace it is \nalso problematic (Fielding and Ruddock 2002; Rudduck and Flutter 2003; Fielding 2004; \nMcMahon and Portelli 2004), problems can arise if the student involvement is not carefully \nintroduced. Martin et al (2005) advocate the prior exploration and questioning of possible \nassumptions about the effects of listening to students, including that it will result in increased \nengagement in school work, improved performance and behaviour. Equally they signal the \nrisks of assuming that listening to and acting on students\u2019 voices will be unproblematic, \nespecially with respect to issues of control currently held by adults. `Imagine Meadfield\u2019 has \nillustrated the latter issue in particular. Consequently, Martin et al (2005) warn that involving \nstudent voice can lead to resentment and disillusionment for both teachers and students. \n \nThese concerns about voice and participation can usefully inform an AI, but do not negate its \npotential. Fielding and Bragg (2003) describe how one school employs an approach similar to \nAI by involving students as researchers to identify good practice in teaching. The government \nagenda is also actively encouraging the development and utilisation of student voice in \nEngland through a number of different strategies, including the collation of data about student \nperceptions within the Ofsted school self-evaluation framework.  \n \n`Imagine Meadfield\u2019 also illustrates that leading an AI process involves politics and the \nexercise of power, even if (as in any process of organisational change) actions might still be \nframed by managers as a rational response to technical problems. For example, the decision to \nrecruit enthusiasts to the core group could be rationalised as best serving the objectives of the \n 24\nAI; equally it could be seen as a political decision to exclude potential dissenters. Even if \nthrough personal choice, those not taking direct part (for example as interviewers) sometimes \nfelt excluded and their responses and sense of involvement needed to be managed. Staff who, \nalong with everyone else, had received the invitation to join in the project but chose not to \nbecome involved, including members of the senior management team, later complained of \nfeeling \u2018left out\u2019 and sought to question the rationale for some of the outcomes. The reasons \nfor not taking part included \u2018not having time\u2019, \u2018I\u2019ll make it if I can\u2019 to a complete \u2018blanking\u2019 \nof the inquiry. Some staff who were asked to supervise the \u2018mini-summit\u2019, felt they had been \n`left with the rest\u2019. \n \nThere were clearly political consequences for staff. The AI was part of an intentional plan on \nthe part of the head and Governors to create more collaborative school procedures and \nplanning. Reactions to the inquiry therefore exposed the extent to which staff were willing to \nbe involved in collaborative processes with other staff and students.  \n \nIt was also evident that the process was managed persuasively in some respects. For example, \nenthusiasm alone did not recruit sufficient commitment to the AI. Despite all students being \ninvited at assemblies, and in tutor group messages, to put their names forward to take part, \nfewer students volunteered to be trained as interviewers than were required. This shortage was \novercome by year managers selecting the appropriate number of students in their year group \nto make up the required quota.  \n \nThe proponents and leaders of such a process may see their actions as democratic and \nenabling participation, especially by invoking discourse such as that of distributed leadership, \nyet be unaware of exercising power in subtle ways. While AI creates the semblance that \n`everything is up for grabs\u2019, leaders can still exercise tacit control over the definition of the \nsituation and the boundaries of the agenda (Lukes 1974). Thus the extent to which the list of \npractical improvements from this AI represents effective school improvement (Flecknoe \n 25\n2005) is debatable. Some changes could be seen as peripheral environmental issues that result \nfrom avoiding enquiry into underlying conflicts and issues of control, authority and so on.  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nWhat might we conclude from this case study about the potential of AI for school \nimprovement, and the implications for leaders? \n \nFirst, the evidence of `Imagine Meadfield\u2019 suggests that AI can involve members of the \nschool community in decision-making, which may assist in the creation of a positive and \ndemocratic ethos. AI could represent a way to counter the exclusion of young people from a \nconsultative process. \n \nSecond, the potential of AI for engaging directly with a school\u2019s culture is probably illustrated \nmost graphically by the way the AI configured around, and ultimately may have assisted the \ncommunity to cope with and recover from, the tragic circumstances described above. As \nElliott observes, the appreciative approach \u2018can play a part in helping the whole organisation \nto reflect on its conscious and unconscious emotional life\u2019 (1999:61). Equally, and without in \nany way wishing to be cynical about the benefits experienced at Meadfield, the extent to \nwhich any organisation can reflect consciously on its unconscious life is likely to be limited. \n \nThird, the case underlines that an AI is necessarily political and that apparently benign, \nrational intentions to encourage participation and to distribute leadership could function to \nrepress or discount diversity and dissent. Leaders are still likely to exercise power and control \nin various ways, even if unaware of this or denying it with their rhetoric. AI can limit as well \nas create opportunity for student voices to be heard, and we have raised the question of the \n 26\nextent to which Imagine Meadfield\u2019s outcomes are peripheral rather than central to school \nimprovement.  \n \nFourth, there are substantial practical implications. It became apparent that a full AI is \nextremely time consuming and difficult to fit into the rigid timetabling structure of a \nsecondary school. The task, and the significance for the success of an AI, of generating \nwhole-school commitment to this process should not be underestimated.  To organise a \nlimited AI involving, for example, a single year group would have been easier to organise and \nwould have involved finding a suitable day on the school calendar when the cohort could \nhave been taken off timetable. To organise an AI involving the whole school was a different \nproposition altogether, presenting significant logistical difficulties for rooming, staffing and \nevents already programmed into the calendar as well as providing training in interviewing. \nThere are questions of whether attempting an AI \u2013 especially for an entire school \u2013 needs the \ninvolvement of an experienced consultant or facilitator; Wikely et al (2005) emphasise both \nexternal and internal change agency as key factors in school improvement. The experience of \nthe AI leads Author A to conclude that the involvement of a facilitator who was external to \nthe organisation, and familiar with the format of AI, was significant. This accords with much \nof the AI literature too (IISD, 2000:5).  On the other hand, an assumption that a skilled \nfacilitator is necessary could have developed as a result of case studies being written up by \nexternal facilitators who present themselves as being the key to a successful project.  \n \nFinally, the limited research to date into AI means there is a need for further critical \nevaluation of the theory and practice of AI. Theoretically, AI is clearly located as a form of \nsocial constructionist thinking, with strong links to literatures concerned with leadership and \norganisational change including complexity theory. Whilst the AI literature to date seems \ndominated by `success stories\u2019, its emphasis on the affirmative and positive does not mean \nthat AI is easy, anodyne or politically neutral, as is illustrated by some studies in the field \n(e.g. Butcher 2005). At the same time, the tendency of the literature to present AI as an \n 27\ninnovative technology, and to fail to consider it also as discursive and political, merely serves \nto emphasise the need for critique. We suggest that AI\u2019s optimistic epistemological stance is \nlikely to remain contentious, but deserves to be taken seriously as a radical alternative to \nmany strategies for change, and treated with appropriate scepticism rather than either \ncynicism on the one hand, or naivety on the other.  \n \nTo sum up, this research is, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, the first case study evaluation to \nconsider the impact of a whole school AI in England. The experience of `Imagine Meadfield\u2019 \nsuggests that AI can involve an entire school community in a process of collaborative school \nreview,   and can engage with school ethos and culture. It can yield practical benefits, in a \nway that may build capacity for school improvement. In terms of implications for school \nleadership, AI is demanding and requires the ability to support participative decision-making. \nIt appears compatible with contemporary emphasis on self-evaluation and distributed \nleadership, acknowledging that the notions must be treated critically in order to avoid treating \nAI as an apolitical technology for change. \n 28\n \n \nReferences \n \nAdamson, J., Samuels, N. & Author A (2002) `Changing the Way we Change\u2019, Managing \nSchools Today, March: 24-27. \n \nAlexander, T.
