Indeed, laser forming has revealed itself to be a viable \nprocess for the production of sheet metal prototypes. Furthermore, the process has been seen to \ndemonstrate potential uses in a great many other engineering applications, some hitherto not possible \nwith other techniques. In particular, many possibilities exist for the deployment of laser forming \nwithin production engineering for alignment and adjustment procedures [1], whilst complex \ngeometric forms, which otherwise can only be produced with great difficulty using conventional \nforming techniques, can be made very simply with laser forming [2]. Although the origins of the laser \nforming technique can be traced back to the established method of flame bending [3, 4], laser forming \nis a much more refined and controllable technique that offers numerous unique applications \npossibilities. This extensive variety of possible applications within engineering results from the \nreasonably high degree of control over the energy transfer, the high levels of accuracy and \nreproducibility, the very high degrees of flexibility and the non-contact nature of the technique; \nattributes directly afforded it by the inherent operating characteristics of lasers. In addition, the laser \nbased nature of the technique means that it could be employed to form parts in locations where it \nwould otherwise be impossible to use conventional forming methods, such as in outer space [5].  \nEssentially laser forming is a spring-back free, non-contact process in which bending is induced by a \nlocalised laser generated temperature gradient between the irradiated surface and the neighbouring \nmaterial. This temperature distribution forces the material to expand non-uniformly, which in turn \nleads to non-uniform thermal stresses. Where the thermal stresses exceed the yield point of the \nmaterial plastic deformation is occasioned. As a consequence the material initially curves inwards \nand then outwards. The latter occurrence being driven by the compressive nature of the thermal \nstresses induced by the more rigid interior material layers which are much cooler. \nEarly work by Namba [5, 6] reported on the potential high degrees of flexibility of the laser forming \nprocess. Since then many researchers have studied various aspects of the technique in great detail. In \nparticular, Vollersten [7, 8], Vollersten et al. [9, 10] and Geiger et al. [11] have investigated \nthoroughly the mechanisms active in laser forming. In more recent times the technique has been \nadvanced through the development of a number of numerical [12-15], analytical [16] and finite \nelement method (FEM) [17-20] mathematical models for various aspects of the laser forming process. \nAdditionally, Hennige et al. [21] and Magee et al. [22] have conducted studies to improve the \n  4 \ndimensional accuracy of parts produced using laser forming, whilst similarly, both Sprenger et al. \n[23] and Li et al. [24] studied the effects of stress and strain on the quality of laser bends. Both Arnet \net al. [25] and Vollersten et al. [26] have successfully demonstrated the techniques ability to form \ncomplex shapes. \nIn all the above studies, however, the sheet metal forming was conducted using the well established \nCO2 or Nd:YAG lasers. This present work, on the other hand, investigates for the first time the use of \nthe contemporary 2.5 kW high power diode laser (HPDL) to carry out the laser forming of common \nengineering mild steel (07 M20). It is believed that a number of process advantages can be realised  \nthrough the employment of the HPDL as a opposed to the CO2 or Nd:YAG lasers. These include the \non-site deployment potential as a result of the HPDL\u2019s inherent portability and robustness and the \nbetter material coupling efficiency (beam absorption) of the HPDL. \n2 Theoretical principles of laser forming \nAs mentioned earlier, the laser forming process is realised by introducing thermal stresses into the \nsurface of a workpiece. These internal stresses induce plastic strains which result in the local elastic \nbuckling of the workpiece. Essentially there are three laser forming mechanisms [10, 11]: the \ntemperature gradient mechanisms, the buckling mechanism and the upsetting mechanism. \n2.1 The temperature gradient mechanism \nThe conditions for the temperature gradient mechanism are energy parameters that lead to a steep \ntemperature gradient across the sheet metal thickness. The beam diameter is typically in the order of \nthe sheet metal thickness, whilst the traverse rate has to be large enough so that a steep temperature \ngradient can be maintained. The path of the laser beam on the surface of the metal is usually a \nstraight line across the whole width, with this straight line being the bending edge. \nInitially the surface of the metal is heated, which in turn leads to pure elastic strains. Owing to the \nthermal expansion of the surface layer of the metal there is a counter-bending of the workpeice away \nfrom the laser beam. The amount of counter-bending is very small as only the heated area on the \nsurface, which is approximately the size of the beam spot, has to generate forces which produce the \ncounter-bending of the whole sheet. Further heating leads to a decrease of the flow stress in the \nheated area and a further increase of the thermal expansion of the surface layer. At a certain \n  5 \ntemperature, which is dependant upon the material, the geometry and the degree of counter-bending, \nthe thermal strains reach the maximum elastic strain that the metal can endure at the given \ntemperature. A further increase in the temperature results in a conversion of the thermal expansion \ninto plastic compressive strains. These plastic compressive strains accumulate until the laser beam \nmoves on allowing cooling to begin. \nCooling is mainly due to self quenching, with the heat flowing into the surrounding bulk material \nresulting in cooling of the heated area within 10-20 seconds. During cooling shrinkage of the heated \nmaterial occurs. This is due to the fact that the surface layer was plastically compressed during \nheating and is therefore shorter after cooling  than the non-heated layers. Owing to the different \nlengths of the surface layer and the lower layers of the material, a bending angle develops towards the \nlaser beam. Typically angles of between 0.10 and 30 are achieved after one laser pass. \n2.2 The buckling mechanism \nThe buckling mechanism will occur if the laser beam diameter is large compared to the sheet metal \nthickness and the processing time is low, resulting in a small temperature gradient across the sheet \nmetal thickness.  \nPrimarily the material is heated, which in turn leads to the thermal expansion of the material and \nresults in compressive stresses in the heated region. If the heated area is large enough, and if there is \na small natural deviated from the perfect plane which normally exists in real metal sheets, an \ninstability, or buckle, develops. In the centre of the buckle the temperature is extremely high, \ntherefore the flow stress in this region is relatively low and the bending of the sheet in this region is \nconsequently nearly totally plastic. In contrast, the root of the buckle, which is far away from the \ncentre of the laser beam, is heated to a much lesser extent. Therefore the temperature is low and the \nflow stress in this region is relatively high, resulting in completely elastic bending of the sheet in this \nregion. By controlling certain parameters, positive (concave bending towards the laser beam) or \nnegative (convex bending away from the laser beam) bending can be achieved with the buckling \nmechanism [25, 26]. \nAs the beam is traversed along the surface the buckle shifts along the bending edge. The direction of \nthe buckling is predetermined by the existing buckle, and as such the remaining part of the sheet \nbuckles in the same direction. The traversing of the beam across the surface also causes the stiffness \nof the workpiece to alter. At the start of the buckling process the bending legs are held in the original \n  6 \nplane due to the stiff surrounding material. As an increasing amount of the sheet is formed by the \nbuckle, the forces that held the bending legs straight decrease. Therefore the elastic part of the buckle \nrelaxes and only the plastic part remains in the sheet, resulting in an angular bend. Because the \nbuckling mechanism results in more energy being coupled into the workpiece, bending angles are \noften up to 150 after one pass of the beam.  \n2.3 The upsetting mechanism \nThe upsetting mechanism will occur if the laser beam diameter is in the order of, or less than the \nsheet metal thickness and the traverse speed is low compared to the thermal conductivity of the \nmaterial. Also, the geometry of the workpiece must be such that buckling of the material is prevented. \nThe low processing speed will result in almost homogenous heating across the thickness of the sheet \nmetal. Owing to the temperature increase, the flow stress decreases in the heated area and the thermal \nstrains approach the elastic strains at the yield stress. Additional heating leads to a plastic \ncompression of the heated material as it is hindered in free expansion by the surrounding bulk \nmaterial. Therefore a large amount of the thermal expansion is converted into plastic compression.  \nDuring cooling the material contracts and the plastic compressive strain remains in the sheet for \nexactly the same reason as in the temperature gradient mechanism. Owing to the constancy of volume \nthere is an increase of the sheet thickness in the compressed area. \n3 Experimental procedure \nThe steel studied in the HPDL forming experiments was a common engineering low carbon mild steel \n(07 M20). The mild steel was received in the form of rectangular billets (100 x 50 x 0.8 mm) and, \nsave for cleaning of the surfaces with methanol to remove any unwanted grease, the billets were used \nas-received in the experiments.  \nThe laser used to conduct the forming experiments was the contemporary 2.5 kW HPDL (Rofin-\nSinar, DL-025), emitting at 940 nm. The defocused multimode laser beam was fired directly onto the \nsamples with rectangular beams of 4 x 4 mm with powers ranging from 1.5 - 2.3 kW. The laser head \nassembly and focusing optics are shown schematically in Fig. 1. The beam was traversed across the \nsamples by means of mounting the assembly head onto the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC table. The \ndefocused laser beam was thus fired across the surface of the mild steel by traversing the samples \n  7 \nbeneath the laser beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC table at speeds of 360 - 840 mm\/min, \nwhilst 20 l\/min of Ar gas was blown across the laser optics to act as a shield. No surface melting of \nthe mild steel was observed on any of the samples during or at the end of HPDL forming. In all the \nexperiments, the holding time between each irradiation was fixed at 0 s. \nThe bending angles obtained as a result of HPDL forming were digitally captured using a CCD \ncamera and measured to an accuracy of \u00b10.10 using image processing software. \n4 Results \nOwing to the fact that the size of the HPDL beam employed in this study was large (4 x 4 mm) \ncompared to the sheet metal thickness (0.8 mm), then, based on the work of Arnet et al. [25] and \nVollersten et al. [26], the buckling mechanism can be sited as the laser forming mechanism \nresponsible for the bending induced by the HPDL. \nAccording to Scully [27], the relationship between laser bending angle and the number of irradiations \nin a multiple-irradiation process is best represented by an \u03b1-n curve, where \u03b1 is the bending angle \nand n is the number of irradiations. Fig. 2 shows the \u03b1-n curves for the 07 M20 mild steel obtained at \ndifferent laser powers but with a fixed traverse speed of 600 mm min-1. As one can see from Fig. 2, \nthe HPDL induced bending angle increases almost linearly with the increasing number of \nirradiations, whilst at the same time, the gradients of the curves increase with increasing laser \nincident power. Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of laser power on the final bending angle (after 40 \nirradiations) at different traverse speeds. As is evident from Fig. 3, a laser power threshold exists \nbelow which no bending will occur. Additionally, it is worthy of note that when the laser power has \nreached a certain value, further increases in power, regardless of the magnitude, effect only marginal \nincreases in the bending angle. \nThe effects of varying the traverse speed, whilst fixing the laser power at 2 kW, on the \u03b1-n curves for \nthe 07 M20 mild steel are shown in Fig. 4. Here the bending angle was seen to increase almost \nlinearly with the number of irradiations, with the gradients of the curves decreasing with increasing \ntraverse speed. The influence of traverse speed on the final bending angle (after 40 irradiations) is \nshown in Fig. 5, revealing that the HPDL induced bending decreased in gradual increments as the \ntraverse speed increased.  \n  8 \n5 Discussion \nThe \u03b1-n curves given in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 are in general agreement with the findings of a number of \nworkers [6, 27, 28] who have observed the existence of a linear relationship between laser bending \nangle and the number of irradiations. Yet such findings are in contrast to those of other researchers \n[22, 23] who have reported a decaying increase in the bending angle with an increasing number of \nirradiations. This significant difference between the findings of this study and those of the latter \nworkers is believed to be due to different degrees of local thickening and strain hardening of the 07 \nM20 mild steel sheet during HPDL bending. From comprehensive studies conducted by Vollersten \n[7] and Sprenger et al. [23], the laser bending angle was said not to increase linearly with the number \nof irradiations due to: (i) changes in the absorption behaviour of the steel with increasing irradiations; \n(ii) the increase in the sheet thickness along the bending edge and (iii) the strain hardening effect on \nthe underside of the sheet. \nIn this present study a HPDL was employed. By virtue of its beam wavelength, the HPDL is a laser \nthat is known to possess relatively high levels of beam absorption with many metallic materials. For \nmild steel the absorption of HPDL radiation is around 45%, compared with only 10-15% for the CO2 \nlaser [29]. Furthermore, since the wavelength of the HPDL is very similar to that of the Nd:YAG \nlaser, 940 nm and 1064 nm respectively, then it is reasonable to assume that the minimised changes in \nabsorptivity observed by Scully [27] for the Nd:YAG laser will occur likewise with the HPDL.  \nIt is known that strain hardening only becomes manifest for relatively thick sheets of typically more \nthan 1 mm in thickness [22]. Moreover, if the sheet is relatively thin, as was the case in this study, the \ninfluence of strain hardening and material thickening along the bend edge can be considered to be \nalmost insignificant when the number of irradiations is small [28]. Hence a linear relationship \nbetween bending angle and the number of irradiations will exist. But, strain hardening and material \nthickening along the bend edge is unavoidable if the number of irradiations increases. This is \nprincipally because local thickening will occur under the temperature gradient mechanism, causing \nthe sheet to increase its thickness locally in the irradiated (and thus heated) zone. In addition, the \nbending angle enlarges when the number of irradiations increases, therefore more work has to be \ndone on the underside of the sheet, which subsequently leads to strain hardening on the underside of \nthe sheet. Consequently, it is thought that the bending angle will no longer be linearly proportional to \nthe number of irradiations as the effects of strain hardening and material thickening along the bend \n  9 \nedge become more pronounced. This postulation is borne out somewhat by Fig. 6. Here the number \nof irradiations was increased considerably from the experimental normal of 40 to 80 irradiations. It is \nclearly evident from Fig. 6 that the increase in the bending angle is no longer linearly proportional to \nthe number of irradiations when the latter exceeds around 55 irradiations. It is therefore possible to \nconclude that for the HPDL bending of the 07 M20 mild steel sheets used in this present study, the \nbending angle is only linearly proportional to the number of irradiations when the latter is small, less \nthan approximately 55 irradiations. It is also reasonable to assert that for the 07 M20 mild steel sheets \ninvestigated, thickening of the material along the bend edge was the predominant factor influencing \nthe absence of linearity when the number of irradiations was large, rather than strain hardening. This \nis due to the fact that the sheets used were less than 1 mm in thickness, thus, since the process is \nthermally driven and the material was thin, only a small amount of cold work could be expected as a \nresult of heat conduction effects. \nAs one can see from Fig. 3, a laser power threshold exists below which no bending could be \noccasioned. Such a finding is in accord with that of Holt [4], who noted that a critical temperature \nwas required for thermal upsetting or a permanent change in shape to take place. It is also apparent \nfrom Fig. 3 that as the laser power was increased beyond a certain value, which differed depending \nupon the traverse speed used, the induced increases in the bending angle were only marginal. This is \nbelieved to be due to the fact that at high laser power, the resultant heat generated will penetrate fully \nto the underside of the sheet. Consequently the temperature gradient across the sheet thickness will \nreduce, causing a considerable reduction in the bending efficiency.  \nTo further determine the significance of these observed thresholds, it was necessary to examine the \nrelationship between the laser bending angle and the laser line energy (with laser line energy being \ndefined by the ratio of the laser power and the traverse speed). This relationship is shown in Fig. 7. \nAs with the results shown in Fig. 3, it is evident from Fig. 7 that a threshold energy input of around \n138 J mm-1 exists, along with an almost linear region when the laser line energy is below 260 J mm-1. \nSuch linearity, coupled with the existence of a minimum laser line energy threshold, implies that the \nHPDL induced bending angle could be accurately controlled by adjusting the laser operating \nparameters. Furthermore, the presence of this linearity and the minimum laser line energy threshold \nconforms with the analytical model developed by Yau et al. [30]. According to this model, laser \nbending angle can be expressed by \n  10 \n    \u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03c1\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n\u2212\n3 7\n2\n362\nAP\nC vh\nl\nh\nY\nEp\n   (1) \nwith the critical condition for bending to occur being given by \n    \n( )\n( )\nAP\nvl\nm\nm\nY C\nE\nh\np\n\u2265\n+\n+\n12 1\n7 1\n2 \u03c1\n\u03b2\n (2) \nwhere \u03b1 is the final laser bending angle, \u03b2 is the coefficient of thermal expansion, A is the \nabsorptivity, \u03c1 is the density, Cp is the heat capacity, Y is the yield strength, E is Young\u2019s Modulus, h \nis the thickness, m is the thickness ratio, P is the laser power, \u03c5 is the traverse speed and l is the beam \nradius. However, since only one type of material is under investigation, Equation (2) can be \nsimplified to \n    \nP\nC\n\u03bd\n\u2265 \u2032  (3) \nwhere C\n\u2019\n is a constant relating to both the material and the geometry characteristics of the 07 M20 \nmild steel sheets. Thus, from Equation (3) it can be deduced that to exercise accurate control of the \nHPDL bending of the 07 M20 mild steel sheets investigated, it is necessary that the process should be \noperated in the line energy range of 138 J mm-1 < P\/\u03bd > 260 J mm-1.  \n6 Conclusions \nThe hitherto unreported bending of 07 M20 mild steel sheet (100 x 50 x 0.8 mm\n3\n) to various degrees \nusing a contemporary 2.5 kW high power diode laser (HPDL) has been successfully demonstrated. \nOwing to the fact that the size of the HPDL beam employed in this study was large compared to the \nsheet metal thickness, the buckling mechanism was sited as the laser forming mechanism responsible \nfor the bending induced by the HPDL. The experimental results revealed that the HPDL induced \nbending angle increased with an increasing number of irradiations and high laser powers, yet \ndecreased as the traverse speed was increased. It was also apparent from the experimental results that \nthe laser bending angle was only linearly proportional to the number of irradiations when the latter \nwas small, less than approximately 55 irradiations. It is believed that the absence of linearity \nobserved when more than approximately 55 irradiations were used is due to local material thickening \n  11 \nalong the bend edge. From graphical results and the employment of an analytical model, the laser line \nenergy range in which accurate control of the HPDL bending of the 07 M20 mild steel sheets could \nbe exercised was found to be 138 J mm-1 < P\/\u03bd > 260 J mm-1.  \n \n  12 \nReferences \n1.
