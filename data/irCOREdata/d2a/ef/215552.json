I argue that these perceptions have relatively little to do with the \npolitics of the various writers, or with the chronology of Napoleon\u2019s career.  Instead, \ninterest in Bonaparte is driven by aesthetic and philosophical concerns:  especially the \nquestion of whether Napoleon is an ordinary man \u2018within\u2019 history, or a semi-\nallegorical personage \u2013 a representative of some ideology or concept (like Liberty or \nHeroism).  I also discuss how Napoleon is appended to the Romantic problem of the \n\u2018overreacher\u2019 who fails due to his glorious success, and who thus blurs the boundaries \nbetween triumph and failure.  Lastly, I show how Napoleon influences Romantic \nconcern about \u2018imposing\u2019 ideas onto analysis of the world.  In this way, Napoleon \nexposes insecurities at the heart of Romantic self-perception.             \n \n 2\n \n \nImposing on Napoleon:  Romantic Appropriation of Bonaparte \n \n\u2018Napoleon was not a personality, but a principle.\u2019 \n      Wellington \nIntroduction \nIn 1798, as the young Napoleon set forth to conquer Egypt, his fame had already \ninfiltrated British Romantic writing.  Before he had become First Consul, let alone \nEmperor, Walter Savage Landor called Napoleon \u2018a mortal man beyond all mortal \npraise\u2019 (Landor, 1937:  I, 44), an individual so prodigiously talented that his glorious \nexample expands the possibilities of human achievement.  Only five years later \nthough, Landor recants these views, adding a footnote to the above line:  \u2018Napoleon \nmight have been [great]\u2019, but became confused, and misused his gifts to \u2018overthrow \nby violence all institutions and to tear all social habits of men\u2019 (II, 549).  This \nspectacular change of mind is important for two reasons.  Firstly, it epitomises the \nvacillation common to many Romantics when discussing Napoleon.  Secondly, more \ncrucially, it shows that the reasons for admiring and attacking him are remarkably \nclose.  Landor changes his conclusion, but not his body of evidence:  Napoleon is still \nan unparalleled talent, only the implications of that gift are reconsidered.   \n \nMy purpose is to explore this range of responses to Bonaparte, within and between \nRomantic writers.  In some respect, such variety is not surprising \u2013 after all, \nNapoleon\u2019s legacy has been a source of profound debate since his death.  However, \nhistorians usually argue that ideas about Bonaparte can be \u2018plotted\u2019 along a political \nor chronological narrative.  In his study of Napoleon\u2019s image through the ages, R. S. \nAlexander suggests that interpretations of him are determined by party politics.  \nSocialists and right-wing dictators were particularly adept at exploiting his legacy for \ntheir own ends, presenting him as a forerunner for their styles of government \n(Alexander, 2001:  54-65).  Other historians base understandings of Napoleon\u2019s \nreputation upon chronology.  Jean Tulard (1984:  344-9) proposes that Napoleonic \nadulation blossomed only after 1815, when contemporary hardships made the Empire \nseem a golden age in retrospect.  Walter Scott hints at this when he writes to John \nMorritt in 1815:  \u2018I shall give offence to [\u2026] the Whigs by not condoling with \n 3\nBonaparte.  Since his sentence of transportation he has begun to look wonderfully \ncomely in their eyes\u2019 (Scott, 1932-7:  IV, 100, my emphasis).  Scott\u2019s phrasing \nsuggests that a reassessment of Napoleon occurred after his banishment to St Helena.  \nIt is difficult, however, to detect such a conveniently dated alteration in Romantic \nwriting on Napoleon.  Instead, views of him follow patterns evident prior to and after \n1815, and these groupings of images and associations offer a clearer picture of \nRomantic understanding of Bonaparte than any chronological scheme. \n \nMy objective is to investigate these associations more precisely; to explain what the \nBritish Romantics thought of Napoleon and why this interest was so high.  As I will \ndemonstrate, political preoccupations or chronological proximity are not enough to \nexplain this fascination.  Instead, he became a conduit for ideas \u2013 and hence I wish to \nargue that he features, not simply as a contemporary figure, or as a source of political \ndebate, but as a kind of philosophical template \u2013 integral to Romantic concepts and \ntheir controversies.  Napoleon, as we shall see, is central to the Romantics\u2019 perception \nof themselves.  \n \nThe Lake Poets\u2019 Disrupted Chronology \nAccording to F. J. Maccunn, the British press began to write extensively about \nNapoleon in 1798, after he concluded his campaigns in Italy, and before the \nexpedition to Egypt (Maccunn, 1914:  9).  At this time too, Napoleon attracted the \nattention of the Lake Poets (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey).  During these early \ndays, Napoleon became appended to the young radicals\u2019 hopes for the Revolution.  \n\u2018His interests, and those of his country, run in parallel\u2019 enthused Coleridge in print \n(1978:  I, 210), while in a letter he is almost inarticulate with joy:  \u2018Buonaparte - ! \ndear DEAR Buonaparte!\u2019 (1956-71:  I, no. 298).  Southey is only slightly less \nhysterical, imagining that Napoleon will create a \u2018home\u2019 in Syria, \u2018flowing with milk \nand honey\u2019 (1965:  I, 185).  It is well known, however, that the Lakers became \nincreasingly conservative later in their careers \u2013 and their views on Napoleon changed \naccordingly.  Southey complains that \u2018He sought thro\u2019 evil means [\u2026] \/ To enslave, \ndenigrate and brutalise mankind\u2019 (1845:  \u2018The Poet\u2019s Pilgrimage to Waterloo\u2019, II iv \n17), while Coleridge rants about a Napoleon-Monster who wears \u2018the putrid Cap of \nJacobin Liberty\u2019 (1956-71:  III, no. 731).  Conventional explanation blames \nNapoleon\u2019s own conduct, particularly his coronation in 1804, for provoking this \n 4\nchange of mind; indeed, Wordsworth mentions the occasion as a seminal reason for \nhis disillusionment, arguing that Napoleon turned potential into empty spectacle \n(1979:  Prelude 1805, Bk. X, lines 930-40). \n \nUpon closer inspection though, this chronology, even the Lakers\u2019 own sense of their \nviews\u2019 alteration, becomes more problematic \u2013 and it is important to acknowledge this \nearly, because vacillation, not coherent development, characterises the Romantic \nunderstanding of Bonaparte.  In his poetry, Southey simply does not discuss his \nchange of mind:  especially after he became Poet Laureate in 1813, he switched to \nextreme condemnation with no self-consciousness.  His letters though, are a different \nmatter.  Writing to Landor in 1814, he defends his original support for Revolution \nbased on hatred of the Bourbons.  Napoleon, he says, completed their overthrow, but \nthen became too monarchical, and must be crushed at all costs.  This strange fusion of \njingoism, radicalism and reasoning, destroys any sense that Southey\u2019s views on \nBonaparte progress smoothly from support to condemnation.  Southey instead \nexposes a public \/ private dichotomy:  his opinions are more extreme in his public role \nas Laureate, and less assured in personal writing.  This represents an important trend \nin other British figures \u2013 even George Cruickshank, the caricaturist who attacked \nNapoleon so mercilessly, expressed a more measured view once the Emperor had \ndied, ambiguously acknowledging his personal debt to a man he was obliged to hate \nfor many years (Ashton, 1888: 440).  \n \nWordsworth rationalises his variable views on a different basis.  Sometimes he admits \nhis change of mind; but more regularly he constructs an elaborate defence of his own \nconsistency (that he is devoted to Freedom \u2013 originally embodied by revolutionary \nFrance, but later by non-absolutist Britain [1979:  Prelude 1805 Bk.  IX, line 520]).  \nWordsworth argues that his principles have remained unswerving, overriding any \nuncertainty about Napoleon.  This may strike us as disingenuous (after all, \nWordsworth plainly does harbour doubtful Napoleonic opinions), but it would be \nequally misleading to explain his thoughts using the language of chronological \ndevelopment \u2013 terminology he explicitly denies.  The most puzzling case though, is \nthat of Coleridge, who demonstrates an almost implausibly extreme change of mind.  \nIn March 1800, he mounts a stirring defence of Napoleon in The Morning Post, \nwriting about his \u2018commanding genius\u2019, \u2018predestined fortune\u2019 and un-despotic \n 5\nambition (1978:  I, 210).  Confusingly though, in a letter dated three months before \nthis article, Coleridge rages against Bonaparte\u2019s \u2018detestable Villainy\u2019, wishing that he \ncould be hanged, for \u2018guillotining is too republican a death for a Reptile\u2019 (1956-71:  I, \nno. 306).  This alteration can be attributed to historical occurrences (e.g. the \nacceptance of the First Consulship offending Coleridge); but this method cannot \nexplain the force of change or the strange reversal three months later.  The complexity \nof Coleridge\u2019s indecision cannot be clarified merely by reference to French politics; \nhis insecurity about Napoleon is not based solely on the chronology of the Imperial \ncareer.  Other criteria must be used to discuss Napoleon\u2019s influence on the Romantics:  \nconceptual \/ thematic ideas which are sometimes, but not necessarily, linked to the \ntemporal progress of French history or Napoleon\u2019s biography. \n \nMan, Devil or God? \nOne such conceptual tension concerns Napoleon\u2019s \u2018humanity\u2019:  whether he is an \nordinary man (however much a success or failure), or a kind of demigod \u2013 a unique, \nsemi-allegorical personage worthy of adulation or denigration.  Despite his ambiguity, \nLandor consistently presents Napoleon as a \u2018mortal man\u2019 \u2013 a daring individual who \npushes human capacity to the limit in pursuit of ever more extreme objectives.  This \nperspective finds popularity in the early correspondence of Coleridge and Southey \u2013 \nespecially when writing to each other.  Coleridge describes Napoleon as a \u2018Man of \nScience\u2019:  a political reorganiser who stabilises new laws for human conduct (1956-\n71:  I, no. 298; 1978:  I, 71).  And Southey lauds him as \u2018philosopher-diplomat\u2019, \npraising Napoleon as a man of rounded talents, not tumultuous imbalances (1965:  1, \n221-2).  Even the Tory Walter Scott pays tribute to Napoleon\u2019s military and \nadministrative prowess:  \u2018 in general, the public actions of Napoleon, at the \ncommencement of his career, were highly laudable:  the softening of civil discord, the \nreconciliation with the Church of Rome, the recall of the great body of emigrants, and \nthe revivification of National Jurisprudence\u2019 (Scott, 1834-6:  XVI, 320).  This view of \nBonaparte did not, of course, originate with the British Romantics.  Las Casas, whose \nmemoirs of Napoleon on St. Helena were bestsellers, presented him as a self-critical \nman \u2013 an accessible, human figure (Alexander, 2001:  34).  And Napoleon\u2019s English \ndoctor, Barry O\u2019Meara, styles him as a sensitive humanitarian (O\u2019Meara, 1969:  II, \n68).   \n \n 6\nThe same writers, however, also criticise Napoleon as a man, pointing out incorrect \ndecisions in policy.  In some early sonnets, Wordsworth derides the hero-worship \nsurrounding the French leader, and identifies flaws in his militaristic political style \u2013 \nnamely the reluctance to collaborate or meditate on ideas (See \u2018Is it a reed that\u2019s \nshaken\u2019 and \u2018Thoughts of a Briton on the Subjugation of Switzerland\u2019 [Wordsworth, \n1923]).  Shelley follows these thoughts, believing Napoleon\u2019s coronation to be an \negotistical policy decision, a return to \u2018frail pomp\u2019 and monarchical personality-\npolitics (\u2018Feelings of a Republican on the Fall of Bonaparte\u2019 [Shelley, 1970]).  \nDamning as these assessments are, they treat Napoleon merely as a politician \u2013 no \ndifferent to any other public person.  This is however, only part of a pervasive \ndilemma in Romantic work \u2013 for Napoleon is also perceived as \u2018more or less than \nman\u2019:  a metaphysical being \u2018beyond\u2019 the bounds of mere humanity (Byron, 1986:  \nChilde Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, III, stanza 38). \n \nAt its most schematic, this involves demonising Napoleon as an evil incarnation.  The \nlater Coleridge becomes particularly fond of this mode:  by 1811, he rages wildly \nabout Bonaparte\u2019s \u2018wicked ambition\u2019, wishing for his assassination (1978:  II, 192-5).  \nIn The Poet\u2019s Pilgrimage, Southey interprets Waterloo as a cosmic conflict:  Heaven \nhas been \u201cinsulted and defied\u201d by Napoleon\u2019s malevolence (1845:  II, iv, 17).  Even \nthe Wordsworths disparage Bonaparte\u2019s \u2018diabolical system\u2019 and \u2018faithlessness in \nevery object\u2019 (1978-88:  \u2018To Southey\u2019, Mar 1827; \u2018To Thomas Powell\u2019 2 Apr 1842).  \nReacting to news of Napoleon\u2019s advance across Spain in 1808, Scott declares, perhaps \nonly half-seriously, \u2018I think some evil demon has been permitted, in the shape of this \ntyrannical monster whom God has sent on the nations [\u2026] I am confident he is proof \nagainst lead and steel, and have only hope that he may be shot with a silver bullet\u2019 \n(Scott, 1932-7:  II, 135).  Significant too is the frequency with which Romantics \ncompare Napoleon to Satan \u2013 an analogy that implies both absolute evil and \ninevitable victory for righteous opponents.  As Simon Bainbridge shows, references to \nMilton\u2019s Satan are particularly extensive (1995: 110-133).  The image invokes a \npolitical thesis founded upon Milton\u2019s theology \u2013 Napoleon as a Satanic insurgent \nwho, fuelled by arrogant individuality, acts rashly to destabilise a carefully \nconstructed world order.  However, as Bainbridge observes, this comparison is \nproblematic given Milton\u2019s notoriously complex presentation of Satan.  Blake chose \nto interpret Satan as an individualist hero, rebelling against tyrannous world order.  \n 7\nAlive to such ambiguity, Hazlitt uses the Satan-image differently \u2013 to celebrate \nNapoleon as a courageous figure, confronting the order of international relations and \nreconstituting it according to his own brilliance, not a preconceived moral code.  For \nHazlitt, Napoleon and Satan both represent revolution against cultural \/ political \nconservatism (Bainbridge, 1995: 185-6).   \n \nThis connects with another, similar presentation of Napoleon:  adulation of him as a \nsuperhuman, transcendent being.  Just as Coleridge abuses Bonaparte in a \nmetaphysical sense, so too does he spiritualise him as an \u2018animal force\u2019 and \u2018hero of \nromance\u2019:  an \u2018essence\u2019 or symbol rather than a real person (1956-71:  I, no. 298; \n1978:  I, 71).  The trope is, however, more common in the younger Romantics.  \nShelley\u2019s reaction to Napoleon\u2019s death mythologises him as a \u2018fiery spirit\u2019; his \nnarrator wonders if the Earth sustains itself on the vitality of his exceptional greatness \n(see particularly \u2018Lines Written on Hearing the News of the Death of Napoleon\u2019).  \nSimilarly, Hazlitt celebrates Napoleon as an \u2018Idea\u2019 not an individual.  In \u2018On the Spirit \nof Partisanship\u2019, he reinvents Napoleon as the personification of Liberty who \u2018alone \ncould prop a declining world\u2019 (Hazlitt, 1930:  XVII, 36-40; XII, 166).  Furthermore, \nthe daring hero suspends the laws of morality:  \u2018Wrong dressed out in pride, pomp \nand circumstance has more attraction than abstract right\u2019 (1930:  XVII, 40).  Hazlitt \nclaims that Bonaparte has created a new morality by battering down traditional \nassumptions and refusing to accept the moral limitations of human conduct.  This \nindicates a crucial difference between Hazlitt and the later Wordsworth:  whereas the \nformer is enthused by the challenge on ethics, Wordsworth is appalled by \u2018the \naudacious charlatan\u2019s\u2019 moral waywardness (1969-70:  22 February 1822).  \n \nThis understanding of Napoleon is not confined to literature.  George Ponsonby, the \nearly nineteenth-century Whig politician, proposed a debate on Napoleon\u2019s greatness, \nadding \u2018I speak not of his moral character [but] of the faculties and energies of his \nmind\u2019 (Harvey, 1998:  27).  Contemporary French artists also presented him as a \ntranscendent being (e.g. David\u2019s \u2018Napoleon Crossing the Saint Bernard\u2019 and Gros\u2019s \n\u2018Bonaparte at the Bridge of Arcola\u2019, which show him as a sublime, almost \nmythological hero [Munhall, 1960, 3-20]).  Alexander even argues that the \ntranscendent view of Napoleon influenced Nietzsche\u2019s notions of \u00fcbermensch and \nwill to power (Alexander, 2001:  140-1).  Indeed, adulatory views of Napoleon remain \n 8\npopular with modern historians \u2013 Ben Jones proclaims that Bonaparte cannot be \njudged \u2018in purely human terms\u2019 for he has \u2018leapt beyond rational bounds\u2019 (Jones, \n1977:  204-5).  The Romanticised view of \u2018the great man\u2019 has played a central role in \ndirecting subsequent (historiographical) perceptions of Napoleon. \n \nHowever, the idea of the Emperor existing \u2018above\u2019 human society was also \ndisconcerting.  Madame de Sta\u00ebl agreed that he positioned himself outside \nconventional moral schemes, but that this indicates egoism and distain for fellow \nhumans (Geyl, 1949:  23).  Shelley becomes similarly estranged by greatness that \ndetaches itself from morality.  In Prometheus Unbound I, 625, he mourns that \u2018The \ngood want power, but to weep barren tears. \/ The powerful goodness want [\u2026]\u2019; and \nin The Triumph of Life (lines 215ff.) he connects these perceptions directly with \nNapoleon \u2013 a man in denial of \u2018virtue\u2019s self\u2019.  Such sentiments typify the Romantic \ntreatment of Napoleon:  self-reflexive judgments constantly open to revision, and a \ndialectical desire to associate observations with an overarching Idea or Concept, but \nreluctance to accept any one position unquestioningly.  \n \nNapoleon as Ideological Instrument \nAs the above discussion indicates, the Romantics regularly configure Napoleon part \nof broader ideological controversies \u2013 both literary (how to interpret Milton) and \npolitical (how to define Tyranny, or Heroism; how to ascertain the limitations of \ndemocracy or individualism).  The public poems of Southey and Wordsworth are \nsaturated with such ideologies:  the Napoleonic wars interpreted as a providential \nclash between Good and Evil and the potential result absorbed into a comprehension \nof Christian history.  In his ode \u2018Imagination \u2013 ne\u2019er before content\u2019, Wordsworth \nclaimed \u2013 to the disgust of Hazlitt \u2013 that the wars, and resultant deaths, were the \ninstrument of God\u2019s plan.  Although this \u2018providential\u2019 view of history is often in \ntension with Wordsworth\u2019s alternative understanding of history perpetrated and \ndirected by human agency, Napoleon is commonly employed as an allegory of moral \nconflict.  In the \u2018Thanksgiving Ode\u2019, for instance, he connects Napoleon\u2019s \u2018Hundred \nDays\u2019 with Satan\u2019s role in the Genesis story, appending moral exegesis to \ninternational politics.  Southey utilises a virtually identical strategy, writing in the \n\u2018Argument\u2019 of The Poet\u2019s Pilgrimage that war is an ideological dispute between the \n\u2018gross material philosophy\u2019 of France and \u2018consistent and clear\u2019 Christianity, a \n 9\nstruggle between \u2018good and evil principles\u2019 (Southey, 1845:  X).  In this way, \nWaterloo becomes a religious experience \u2013 a revelation of moral Truth and the \nincomprehensible will of divine power.  Although he participates in similar \ndemonisation of Napoleon, Scott also reveals how these associations serve partisan \npurpose, providing a clear enemy to bolster both governmental unity and newspaper \nsales:  \u2018the newspapers miss Napoleon, as the Church would miss the Devil, were it \npossible to annihilate [the] arch-enemy of mankind\u2019 (Scott, 1932-7:  III, 444).  By \ndrawing an analogy with Satan, this extraordinary sentence manages both to \ndemystify and participate in the appropriation of Napoleon for ideological purposes.     \n \nHazlitt also uses the Emperor as an ideological symbol:  the instrument and \nrepresentative of a changing society, less an autonomous person than the tool of broad \nhistorical forces.  In the Life of Napoleon, Hazlitt incorporates him into class politics:  \nhe symbolises wide social changes \u2013 the rise of middle-class men of talent, at the \nexpense of aristocracy.  Napoleon \u2018sprang from the earth\u2026 annulling the distinction \nbetween classes\u2019; he \u2018rose to the height of kings from the level of the people, and \nproved there was no natural inferiority in the one case, no natural superiority in the \nother\u2019 (Hazlitt, 1930:  XIV, 302).  This is, of course, a controversial conclusion, \nignoring Napoleon\u2019s monarchical leanings and tendency to proclaim himself \u2018a \nsuperior being\u2019(Markham, 1963:  29).  But Hazlitt has no desire to present a balanced \nportrait.  When he relates the meeting between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII in 1804, \nhe stresses that Bonaparte conducted himself like an equal.  Despite knowing that the \npurpose of the occasion was to facilitate Napoleon\u2019s coronation, Hazlitt interprets the \nevent as a kind of historical stand-off between ancient theocracy and new democracy, \nbetween Privilege and Liberty.  The process of this appropriation is explored \nilluminatingly by Tom Paulin, who investigates how Hazlitt connects the rich imagery \nof Orion with mythologisation of Napoleon:  \u2018Orion is both changing sea and starry \nconstellation for Hazlitt, just as Napoleon is both a great historical force and a mythic \nfigure who exists as a fixed heroic pattern in the heavens\u2019 (Paulin, 1998:  224).  There \nis an important parallel here:   between the apparent fixity of the Orion constellation \nand mythology, and the variable ends to which Hazlitt puts that imagery; between his \ncertainty about what Napoleon signifies, and his implicit awareness of the flexibility \nof that appropriation.  This illuminates the paradox of interpreting Napoleon:  any \nassertion of what he \u2018denotes\u2019 or \u2018means\u2019 necessarily acknowledges the variability of \n 10\npossible interpretation \u2013 for that variability makes possible such secure, and \napparently unambiguous, reinterpretations of Napoleon and his legacy.         \n \nHazlitt and the later Coleridge celebrate or castigate Napoleon almost exclusively in a \ntheoretical manner \u2013 as the embodiment philosophical notions (like Rebellion or \nFreedom).  Sometimes, he is used to define those notions (e.g. Hazlitt\u2019s model of \nclass-conflict); at others the Romantics attach him to extant theses (like Wordsworth\u2019s \ninterpretation of Christian history).  But this conceptual line of thinking has proven \nextremely influential amongst later historians \u2013 who have attempted to decipher a \n\u2018grand idea\u2019 behind Napoleon\u2019s Empire.  Albert Sorel proposes that Napoleon \ncontinued Louis XIV\u2019s plan to expand to France\u2019s \u2018natural frontiers\u2019; Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric \nMasson believes Bonaparte\u2019s state-reform was motivated primarily by Corsican \nclannishness and \u2018personality-cult\u2019 government; while Edgar Quinet suggests that he \nsought to emulate Roman empire building (see Ellis, 1997:  3 and 224-7).  Discussing \nthese contentious formulations, Geoffrey Ellis remarks that Napoleon cannot be \ndiscussed in terms of ideology, because he did not possess any single motivating \n\u2018idea\u2019, preferring to constantly revise his strategies (1997:  5-6).  But this is \nmisleading \u2013 for, as we have seen, it is simple to attach ideology to Napoleon and his \nregime, and his failure to present a \u2018grand idea\u2019 makes it easier to append a range of \nconcepts \u2013 more than would otherwise be possible.  As Lefebvre observes, this \nrenders him a kind of vacuum \u2013 associated with everything and nothing, a Lockean \nblank slate suitable for personalised decoration (Lefebvre, 1969:  63-8).  In his study \nof Wordsworth, Alan Liu notes that configuring Napoleon in this manner \ndecontextualises him \u2013 it removes him from historical circumstance and treats him as \nan instrument of philosophy rather than a participant in human history (Liu, 1989:  \n35).  This tendency does not, however, define Romantic management of Napoleon \u2013 \nfor, as the next section explores, it is merely one aspect of another significant \ninconsistency. \n \nBonaparte\u2019s Role in History \nElsewhere, in their writing, the Romantics are concerned to locate Napoleon in the \ncontext of the Revolution and the ancien r\u00e9gime.  Once again, this preoccupation \nfollows Napoleon\u2019s lead:  Ellis notes how official reference to the Empire and \nEmperor invoked previous civilisations and leaders \u2013 from the adoption of the \n 11\nFrankish eagle as an allusion to Charlemagne, to the Caesar-style portraits of \nNapoleon on currency.  Bonaparte possessed a heightened awareness of his historical \nsignificance, presenting himself as the culmination of history \u2013 as if previous events \nmerely adumbrated his achievement (1997: 157-9).  \u2018If I had succeeded,\u2019 he once \nclaimed, \u2018I should have been the greatest man known to history\u2019 (Markham, 1963, \n252), placing himself within historical context, and yet unique for his scope of \ninfluence.  Even in failure, he directs the course of history \u2013 not aloof from human \nsociety, but dictating its progression.        \n \nWhen he writes about Napoleon, Shelley treats the Emperor as a continuation of \nancien r\u00e9gime government.  He becomes disillusioned because he cannot detect any \ndifference between Napoleon and the Bourbon monarchs:  Bonaparte has shunned \nliberty and constructed his government upon \u2018old Custom, legal Crime \/ And Bloody \nFaith\u2019 \u2013 the same materials that propped up Louis XIV (\u2018Feelings of a Republican on \nthe Fall of Bonaparte\u2019, lines 13-14).  Napoleon is therefore not a turning point in \nhistory \u2013 he inherits the long, tyrannous tradition of dictator-leaders who impose their \nwill on society at the expense of ordinary people.  This analysis emphasises the \nperverse insignificance of Napoleon:  as a participant in a continuing tradition of \noppression, he is distinguished neither by his methods, nor his depravity.  Like the \nking in \u2018Ozymandias\u2019, Napoleon\u2019s vanity will be defeated by time\u2019s scrutiny.  Byron \nadopts a similar position in Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, where the narrator attacks \nNapoleon for returning to outmoded forms of government:  \u2018Can tyrants but by \ntyrants conquer\u2019d be?\u2019 (part IV, stanza 96).  In questions like this, Byron configures \nhistory as a depressingly unchangeable cycle, and Napoleon as part of that vicious \ncontinuance. \n \nHazlitt however, equally iconoclastic in his politics, sees Napoleon as a radical \ndeparture from the ancien r\u00e9gime \u2013 initiating a new style and premise for government.  \nHe consolidated the Revolution, says Hazlitt, institutionalising it, and preventing its \ncollapse.  He overcame the \u2018foul Blatant Beast\u2019 monarchy, \u2018played with its crowns \n[\u2026 making it] a mockery to the nations\u2019 (1930:  VII, 10).  As Bainbridge comments, \nthis is an incomplete assessment, ignoring the question of whether Napoleon \nstrengthened monarchical tradition rather than destroyed it (1995:  207).  But Hazlitt\u2019s \nappraisal is no simplistic idolisation; it is a nuanced perception of Napoleon\u2019s place in \n 12\nhistory \u2013 the heir of Revolution and engineer of social change.  Similarly, Stendhal \ndeclares Napoleon a \u2018professeur d\u2019en\u00e9rgie\u2019, liquidating the old order and founding a \nnew historical era (Geyl, 1949:  32-8).  From a different political persuasion, the \ncartoonist Gillray also portrays Napoleon as an agent of Revolution:  his 1798 \n\u2018Search-Night\u2019 pairs Bonaparte with Robespierre above the motto \u2018Vive l\u2019Egalit\u00e9\u2019 \n(Bainbridge, 1995:  35).  This practise, of associating Napoleon with Revolutionary \naims, assumes a progressive (rather than cyclical) view of history:  Europe has \npermanently changed, for good or ill, and Napoleon supervises that alteration.  \nMoreover, such speculation is the earliest flowering of a pervasive historiographical \ntrend:  trying to connect Napoleon\u2019s legacy to that of the Revolution.  Martyn Lyons \nrepresents the most recent end of this tradition \u2013 he argues that Napoleon\u2019s social \nreforms completed the Revolution, promoting the bourgeoisie at the expense of \nnobility (Lyons, 1994:  294-9).   \n \nThe most complex discussion of Napoleon\u2019s historical significance occurs in the Lake \nPoets\u2019 writing.  They consistently regard the Napoleonic period as a critical turning \npoint in history, but vary their explanations for this conclusion.  In 1800, Coleridge \nwrote that Napoleon unified Revolutionary principles with the governmental style of \neighteenth-century \u2018enlightened despots\u2019 \u2013 although he wavers over whether he \nconsiders this as a daring success or a gross betrayal (firstly of Revolutionary \nobjectives, and, later in life, of the sanctity of monarchy) (1978:  I, 71).  In his Life of \nNapoleon, Scott also proclaims the Emperor a fusion of radical reformer and ancien \nr\u00e9gime despot:  he crafted a new style of leadership which replaced \u2018the reserved \ndignity\u2019 of recent monarchs with active military and administrative participation \n(Scott, 1834-6:  XIV, 403). This formulation has proved very popular in recent \nunderstandings of political ideas.  Michael Broers, for instance, credits Napoleon for \nestablishing a new form of government:  authoritarianism justified with the rhetoric of \nRevolution \u2013 equality, liberty and legalism (1996:  16-17). \n \nWordsworth, on the other hand, complains that Napoleon cheated France of its \npotential, and he castigates the Emperor for changing history for the worse.  He has \ncommitted the \u2018last opprobrium, when we see the dog \/ Returning to his vomit, when \nthe sun \/ That rose in splendour [\u2026] Hath put his function and his glory off, \/ And \nturned into a gewgaw, a machine\u2019 (The Prelude (1805), X, 935-9).  Napoleon\u2019s \n 13\nregime is both a rupture from past promise (the sun of Revolution turning into \nartificial theatrical machinery) and a shameless throwback to failed forms of \ngovernment.  As Wordsworth\u2019s career develops though, this sense of degeneration \ngrows still more complicated:  how has Napoleon damaged France\u2019s potential? \u2013 by \nassisting the Revolution in its assault on monarchy, or by corrupting the purposes of \nRevolution itself?  Wordsworth\u2019s view of Napoleon\u2019s historical significance thus \nvaries along with his fluctuating political inclinations.  Bonaparte occupies a \nparadoxical position in the poet\u2019s work:  he is, at times, the antithesis both of \nmonarchy and the Revolution \u2013 a turning point in history and a retrospective figure, \nreturning France to how it used to be, either under the Terror or Louis XIV.   \nEstablishing a chronology for these variable conceptions is extremely difficult:  in \nbooks nine and ten of The Prelude (1805), Napoleon is at once a radical despoiler and \nan unjust conservative autocrat.   \n \nDespite their occasional tendency to abstract Napoleon, the Romantics therefore \nremain historically aware, keen to determine and question his historical role.  This \ninterest reflects concern for their \u2018historical experience\u2019 \u2013 their position as interpreters \nof history; and for this reason they view Napoleon according to their own political \nagendas (conservative, radical or both), to emphasise their double-role as participants \nin, and elucidators of, history (Bainbridge, 1995, 208).  Some might argue that this \nNapoleonic appropriation ignores or manipulates Bonaparte as a historical figure \u2013 \nbut this is only partly true, for it also exposes the Romantics\u2019 deep involvement with \npolitics and ideas of historical development.  One need not go as far as Arthur Bryant, \nwho bizarrely argues that Wordsworth influenced the course of the Napoleonic Wars \n(\u2018To understand why England defeated Napoleon, one should study Wordsworth\u2019 \n[1944:  xii]).  But writing on Napoleon, they articulate and direct conceptions of the \nEmperor \u2013 guiding not only their contemporaries, but subsequent historiographical \ntrends as well.  \n \nMan of the People; Man of the Poets \nAmidst all this talk of \u2018Napoleon and ideology\u2019 and \u2018Napoleon\u2019s historical role\u2019, one \ncan easily lose sight of Bonaparte the man \u2013 a problem that preoccupied his \ncontemporary apologists.  This interpretation of the Emperor is no less ideologically \nmotivated than the views discussed above, but unlike them, it disguises its \n 14\nappropriative techniques by purporting to reveal the \u2018real\u2019, \u2018human\u2019 Napoleon.  \nGros\u2019s painting \u2018Bonaparte Visiting the Victims of the Plague at Jaffa\u2019 which shows \nhim tending to the sick, reasserts his humanity and approachability, as well as his \nadmirable fearlessness \u2013 a man of the people, but not quite one of them (Munhall, \n1960:  6).  This image, of Napoleon as \u2018man of the people\u2019, has proved particularly \nenduring, not only in France, but also in the United States, where Bonaparte\u2019s \nachievements were appended to the mythology of the American Dream (Alexander, \n2001:  52-3).  Napoleon skilfully cultivated such imagery, publishing his military \nspeeches and conferring honours on all soldiers, not just officers.  In Scott\u2019s words, he \npresented himself as \u2018the father of the war, to whom his soldiers were as children, and \nto whom the honour of the meanest private was as dear as his own\u2019 (1834-6:  XII, \n378-9).  Bonaparte the \u2018Common Man\u2019 pervaded popular culture:  Jean-Charles \nPellerin produced cheap prints of soldiers in Napoleonic poses, invoking both the \nEmperor and the ordinary men who fought for him (Forrest, 2001:  52-3). \n \nSome Romantics found this formulation attractive:  they applauded Napoleon as a \nsymbol of what one could achieve regardless of social background, and thus \nconnected him to a meritocratic social vision \u2013 where status is based upon talent, not \nbirth.  In his letters, Byron speaks enthusiastically about Napoleon as \u2018first man\u2019 \u2013 a \ndeserving meritocratic champion, not a dictator (1973-94:  III, 218; IV, 284).  Hazlitt \ngoes further still, suggesting that he fought on behalf of \u2018a whole people\u2019, ensuring the \nvictory of \u2018personal merit over rank and circumstance\u2019, and enshrining a system in \nwhich \u2018one was devoted to millions, not millions to one\u2019 (1930:  XIII, ix-x).  This \nsupposition is wilfully uncompromising, and the \u2018meritocratic Napoleon\u2019 may seem \nlike an ideological appropriation like any other.  But unlike the vision of Napoleon as, \nsay, \u2018Liberty\u2019, it has at its centre Bonaparte\u2019s personality \u2013 a real man who has \nsucceeded with hard work and talent, not merely a concept or idea(l). \n \nUnlike Hazlitt or Byron, whose versions of the \u2018meritocratic Napoleon\u2019 tend to be \noversimplified, other contemporaries are more aware of the complexities of \nmeritocracy.  According to Scott, Napoleon only presented himself as a meritocratic \nhero; his government owed more to absolutism and ambition\u2013 a doubleness that \nHazlitt is reluctant to admit (Scott, 1834-6:  XII, 345 and 378).  Moreover, Stendhal\u2019s \nScarlet and Black diagnoses the problems of Napoleonic aspiration:  how \u2018the \n 15\ndetermination to achieve equality via merit hides the irresistible urge to show oneself \ninferior to none\u2019.  Meritocracy does not necessarily lead to equality, it also encourages \nsuperiority \u2013 and the latter concern preoccupied Napoleon more than pretensions of \negality (Talmon, 1967:  158).  Chateaubriand objects in somewhat different terms, \nprotesting that Napoleon did indeed level society, but in a negative sense, reducing \nsovereignty to \u2018plebeian depths\u2019 (Geyl, 1949:  30).  For these writers, Napoleon\u2019s \npersonal qualities and achievements have rearranged views of the social order; their \ncriticisms paradoxically admit to the extent of his influence.   \n \nAlthough the Romantics view Napoleon\u2019s \u2018meritocratic\u2019 credentials differently, they \nare all fascinated by his personality, regularly calling themselves the \u2018Napoleon of \nletters\u2019 with varying degrees of subtlety.  In Don Juan Byron half-seriously denotes \nhimself \u2018the grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme\u2019, claiming \u2018Juan was my \nMoscow\u2019 and \u2018I will fall at least as my hero fell\u2019 (canto XI, stanza 55-6).  This might \nbe interpreted as comic exaggeration, except that he makes similar claims in private \nletters.  In 1821, he began to sign his name \u2018NB\u2019 (\u2018Noel Byron\u2019), to provoke \ncomparison between Napoleon and himself (1973-94: IX, 171).  According to Leigh \nHunt, Byron would boast of this tenuous connection:  \u2018Bonaparte and I are the only \npublic persons whose initials are the same\u2019 (Hunt, 1828:  I, 125).  One must not over-\nemphasise these correlations, for Byron also claims not to idolise Napoleon (1973-94:  \nV, 201).  Nevertheless, he revels in the Emperor\u2019s refracted glory, sharing his interest \nin publicity and public image.   \n \nWordsworth equates himself with Bonaparte more carefully.  In \u2018I grieved for \nBuonapart\u00e9\u2019 he connects Napoleon to his own development and theories about \nchildhood.  He implicitly compares Napoleon unfavourably to himself, since he \n(Wordsworth) has enjoyed \u2018books, leisure, perfect freedom [\u2026] \u2018the stalk \/ True \nPower doth grow on\u2019 (Wordsworth, 1923).  The poem therefore disparages Napoleon, \nbut also inflates him, presenting his fame and success as a foil for Wordsworth\u2019s \ngreater imaginative power.  Moreover, in a close reading of The Prelude Book VI, \nAlan Liu connects Wordsworth\u2019s thought processes with Napoleon\u2019s career:  as the \npoet describes his crossing of the Alps in 1790, he alludes to Napoleon\u2019s later \nventures on the same route \u2013 both the 1800 journey, and the 1798 invasion of \nSwitzerland (which Wordsworth mistakenly attributes to Napoleon).  The Emperor \n 16\nhaunts Wordsworth\u2019s sense of his own past:  despite attempts to erase the memory of \n\u2018banners militant\u2019, he conceives this phase of his life in terms of Napoleon (Liu, 1989:  \n28-9).  This deeply hidden Napoleonic preoccupation is somewhat unusual \u2013 \nespecially when compared to Balzac\u2019s bombastic use of Bonaparte to assert his \nhistorical consequence:  \u2018What he failed to do by the sword, I shall achieve by the \npen\u2019 (Gu\u00e9rard, 1924:  191).  But this personal equation with Napoleon occurs in \nunlikely writers.  Despite his hostility, Chateaubriand still identifies with Napoleon, \nbelieving in the \u2018fraternity of their geniuses\u2019, even their \u2018parallel destinies\u2019 (Boorsch, \n1960:  55-62).  Perhaps, however, like Wordsworth, Chateaubriand\u2019s readiness to \ncritique his \u2018counterpart\u2019 is an attempt to assert his superiority \u2013 rather than attach his \nlife to Napoleon\u2019s success, he contrasts the Emperor\u2019s faults with his own steadfast \nmorality. \n \nThe Romantics, therefore, feed from Napoleon\u2019s stature \u2013 a strategy which reflects \ntheir ambiguous treatment of him.  They compare themselves with him, but also \ncensure him, asserting their supremacy by taking control of his image, by bending \nhim to their ideological ends.  Firstly, this exposes how Napoleon facilitates the \nRomantics\u2019 view of themselves; as I will show shortly, Bonaparte is crucial to \nRomantic self-perception.  Secondly, it reveals how Romantics simultaneously seek to \nmagnify and denigrate Napoleon.  This is, of course, an ambivalence that extends \nbeyond Romantic writing.  Contemporary caricaturists habitually depicted him as a \ntitanic giant, fearsome to behold, or a ridiculous dwarf, pathetic for his pretensions.  \nDebate rages over whether this indicates uncertainty about how to regard Napoleon; \nor whether it is a sustained campaign to forge a sense of British greatness, by both \nmocking him and celebrating victory over his unparalleled power (Kelley, 1991:  \n354).  Either way, the Romantic use of Napoleon is highly personal, and yet reflects \npopular presentations of international relations.  The Romantics seek to lead social \nunderstandings of Napoleon through their analysis and public proclamations; but they \nalso follow social and literary trends \u2013 behaviour which undermines their self-\nmythologisation as men of solitary genius. \n \nThe Glorious Failure \nIn the light of this magnification \/ denigration dichotomy, we must consider perhaps \nthe most important conception of Napoleon:  his association with failure.  As if to \n 17\ncounterbalance exclamations about his glory and success, the Romantics also \naccentuate his inglorious failings, even his insignificance.  Southey is particularly \nharsh:  his late-1805 letters belittle Napoleon, decrying the British and Austrians for \nsuccumbing to such a feeble foe (1849:  II, 357; III, 11).  Wordsworth also scorns \nthose \u2018men of prostrate mind\u2019 who bow down to Napoleon\u2019s \u2018transient\u2019, illegitimate \npower (see \u2018Calais, August, 1802\u2019).  This strikes the reader as slightly hypocritical, \nsince both poets are concerned elsewhere to accentuate his prestige.  But it is crucial \nto recognise that reactions to Napoleon are not uniformly extreme or theoretical \u2013 he \nis also met with a fa\u00e7ade of disinterest.  This is potentially another way for the \nRomantics to assert themselves over Napoleon \u2013 attempting to deny his imaginative \nhold over them by pretending he is inconsequential.  A similar strategy has been \nidentified in the British press:  The Times continually asserted that Napoleon\u2019s reign \nwas doomed; while The Edinburgh Review subverted his propaganda by comparing \nFrance with Rome \u2018in the vices of her decline\u2019 (January 1809).  This reminds us of an \nobvious but oft-forgotten detail:  treatment of Napoleon, both in Romantic writing and \nthe press, was often thoughtful and balanced, not moulded exclusively by extremism \nand uncertainty.  \n \nMore commonly, however, Napoleon is presented as a glorious failure:  an \noverreacher who fails due to his extraordinary success.  Scott asserts that Napoleon \nwas \u2018tried in the two extremes, of the most exalted power and the most ineffable \ncalamity\u2019 (1834-6:  XVI, 342), although Shelley and Byron investigate how success \nand failure are interrelated, not separate extremities.  In Childe Harold, Byron \ndiscusses Napoleon in the context of conquerors that cause their own downfall:  he \n\u2018ascends to mountain-tops\u2019, surpassing mankind, but upon these heights of glory he is \nassailed by \u2018contending tempests\u2019 and the hatred of his peers.  Success and failure are \npart of the same experience:  Napoleon \u2018Preys upon high adventure, nor can tire \/ Of \naught but rest; a fever at the core, \/ Fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore\u2019 \n(canto II, stanza 42-44).  The overreacher-image also echoes throughout The Age of \nBronze, where Byron comments on the glorious folly of other conquerors \u2013 notably \nAlexander the Great, who \u2018wept for worlds to conquer\u2019, defeated by his own \naccomplishments (line 35).  Napoleon similarly broke down the \u2018fetters\u2019 of human \nlimitations, but simultaneously \u2018crush\u2019d the rights of Europe\u2019, failing to be restrained \nby moral standards (255-9).  This view of Bonaparte as overreacher is, I would \n 18\nsuggest, an attempt to unify the providential \/ spiritual and human \u2018ideas\u2019 of \nBonaparte \u2013 to explain his huge achievements without forgetting his human fallibility. \n  \nAnother way of expressing this theme is by adapting the Prometheus myth:  the \nlegend of how Prometheus stole the secret of fire from the Greek gods and was \npunished for overreaching his station.  Byron makes this analogy in Bronze, writing \n\u2018Oh dull Saint Helen!  with thy gaoler nigh \u2013 \/ Hear! hear Prometheus from his rock \nappeal\u2019  (226-7).  And in the \u2018Ode to Napoleon\u2019, he compares the Emperor to \u2018the \nthief of fire from heaven\u2019, supposing that he will endure his martyrdom with similar \ndignity.  Blake\u2019s lost painting \u2018The Spiritual Form of Napoleon\u2019 (1821) also depicted \nhim as a Promethean-figure, grasping the sun whilst chained to the Earth \u2013 almost \ndivine, but constrained by failure (Bloom, 1960:  79-82).  Bonaparte seems to have \nencouraged the comparison:  one semi-apocryphal story has him inscribing the \nfollowing before death:  \u2018A new Prometheus, I am nailed to a rock to be gnawed by a \nvulture.  Yes, I have stolen the fire of Heaven and made a gift of it to France.  The fire \nhas returned to its source, and I am here\u2019 (Haythornthwaite, 1996: 301).  Even if the \nstatement is fabricated, the image loses none of its force, for it shows a diligent \nattempt to mythologise Napoleon\u2019s godlike actions and portentous utterances.  \nApplied conventionally, the Prometheus-image therefore represents the brave but \ndisastrous efforts of an arrogant creature reaching beyond previous realms of \npossibility.  Shelley however, employs the image for different ends.  In Prometheus \nUnbound, he foregrounds Prometheus\u2019s rescue by Hercules and victory over his \nassailant Jupiter. The myth thus becomes the reverse of the overreacher-motif:  a \nworthy, long-suffering being enjoys success because of failure.  This makes the image \nstill more complex, blurring the boundaries between success and failure until they can \nhardly be distinguished.  Perhaps this is appropriate \u2013 after all, such intricacy reflects \nRomantic uncertainty about Napoleon, and how, when writing about him, affirmative \nand pessimistic judgements blend into one another. \n \nThe uneasy synthesis of accomplishment and failure haunts Shelley\u2019s final treatment \nof Napoleon in the unfinished \u2018The Triumph of Life\u2019.  Like \u2018a thousand climbers\u2019, \nBonaparte strode to the peak of opportunity, only to topple into infamy:  \u2018The child of \na fierce hour; he sought to win \/ The world, and lost all that it did contain of \ngreatness\u2019 (217-9).  Shelley attaches this reflection to his most urgent enquiries \n 19\nconcerning the purpose of life and the limits of knowledge.   Napoleon\u2019s prominence \npropels him to the brink of impossible achievements, ensuring that success and \ndistress are so close as to be identical.  Shelley shares in this pattern, for his work \nexplores metaphysical questions that remain unanswered, his skill and perceptiveness \nsimilarly pushing him towards failure.  In \u2018To a Skylark\u2019, for instance, Shelley \nstruggles to describe the bird\u2019s song, using a series of similes that complicate, rather \nthan articulate, his understanding of the music.  He is overwhelmed, not only by the \nlimitations of language, but also by his own talents:  he fails due to success.  \nMoreover, by asking \u2018what is life?\u2019 at the end of \u2018The Triumph\u2019, Shelley draws his \nreaders into the process, pushing us towards Napoleonic disappointment by testing the \nlimits of rational enquiry, anticipating our own intellectual failure.  In \u2018The Triumph\u2019, \nShelley thus unifies various conceptions of Napoleon:  he becomes a theoretical, \nmetaphysical exemplar, and a close, personal figure, whose presence and abilities \npertain to all who read the poem.  Shelley merges the \u2018spiritual Napoleon\u2019 with \n\u2018Bonaparte the man\u2019 in one extraordinary image. \n \nNapoleon\u2019s Self-Image:  Mastery and Insecurity \nAmidst this obsessive interest in Napoleon, one question remains unanswered:  why \nwere the Romantics so preoccupied by his career?  A partial explanation lies in \nNapoleon\u2019s astute cultivation of his own image.  He habitually associated himself \nwith ideologies, thereby providing a precedent for the Romantics to impose their own \nideas onto his person and legacy.  Historians have grown increasingly curious about \nthis \u2018chameleon\u2019 Napoleon who self-consciously manipulates his presentation to \nassociate himself with useful ideas.  The talent was evident throughout his rise to \npower.  He began his career as a devotee of patronage, attaining entry to military \nschool and his first commission through the influence of patrons.  After the \nRevolution, Napoleon allied himself with the Jacobins, writing a pamphlet in 1793 \nwhich discredited Robespierre\u2019s enemies (Alexander, 2001:  15-16).  Napoleon thus \nadapted to social circumstances, exploiting different facets of French society to \nconstruct a range of public faces.  As we have seen, he became particularly proficient \nat using military bulletins and official portraits to promote various \u2018images\u2019 \nconcurrently \u2013 from regal Emperor, to bourgeois meritocrat, to latter-day \nRevolutionary.  These propaganda techniques were evident to his contemporaries:  \nwriting in 1812, John Galt discovers \u2018a narrative of the exploits of the Emperor \n 20\nNapoleon, printed at Paris, in Arabic characters, for the purpose of shewing that he is \na man sent by heaven to alter the condition of the world\u2019 (Galt, 1812:  120-1).  And \nnor was Napoleon interested merely in his current image, since he was also a \nrevisionist historian reinterpreting his past to the best advantage.  In accounts of his \ncoup on 18 Brumaire, for instance, he re-formulated his speech as brilliant rhetoric, \nnot the clumsy mumbling that other commentators (including his own secretary, \nBourreinne) recall (Andrews, 1929).  Pieter Geyl notes that, despite his concerted \neffort to embody ideals (e.g. Revolution or Heroism) Bonaparte\u2019s methods in fact \ndemonstrate his ruthless pragmatism (1949:  146).  Such shrewd command of his own \nimage might imply that Napoleon planned to be interpreted by his contemporaries.  \nAnd indeed, F. G. Healey (1959) uncovers his admiration for what is sometimes \ncalled \u2018pre-Romanticism\u2019:  those eighteenth-century works which initiate, or \nanticipate, later Romantic concerns.  Napoleon read Rousseau, Goethe and Ossian \navidly, reaching out to Romantic thought, rather than passively waiting to be adopted.   \n \nHowever, what allows British Romantics to appropriate Napoleon for themselves is \nthe inconsistency of his image creation:  he left himself vulnerable to a kind of public \nschizophrenia, a victim of fragmented representation.  In this way, Napoleon was \nnever in full control of his likeness:  he was, says Holtman (1950:  215), continually \nfighting his own people to impress upon them the images he preferred.  John Keats \nmentions Napoleon very little, but one passing remark is especially instructive:  \ntalking about his poem Hyperion, Keats says \u2018the Hero of the written tale being \nmortal is led on, like Buonaparte, by circumstance\u2019 (Motion, 1997:  224).  Napoleon, \nKeats implies, lacks control \u2013 forces beyond his direction determine his actions.  This \nmodel had found favours with recent historians:  Jones declares that \u2018his dominance \nrelied upon favourable circumstances\u2019, and his failure to interpret those circumstances \ncorrectly, especially in Russia, provoked his downfall (Jones, 1977:  204).  On Saint \nHelena, Napoleon apparently acknowledged this flaw:  \u2018I never was truly my own \nmaster; but was always controlled by circumstances [\u2026] I moulded my system \naccording to the unforeseen succession of events\u2019 (Ellis, 1997:  195).  Bonaparte was \nso preoccupied with using circumstances to fashion his self-presentation, that he could \nnot achieve any stability of image.  Instead, he was at the mercy of incidental \nfluctuations.  Scott hints at this circumstantial instability when he says that \nNapoleon\u2019s \u2018keen sensitiveness to the attacks of the public press attended him through \n 21\nlife and [\u2026] seemed to remind him that he was still a mortal man\u2019.  Crucially \nhowever, Scott also implies that such public presentation heightened his confidence \nand authority:  \u2018one species of idolatry was gradually and ingeniously substituted for \nanother [until] the name of a successful general was of more influence than the whole \ncode of the Rights of Man\u2019 (1834-6:  X, 169; XII, 304). \n \nThis dual aspect of Napoleon\u2019s legacy \u2013 this combined mastery, and insecurity, of \nself-image \u2013 fascinates and inspires the Romantics.  Despite their opposing politics, \nScott and Hazlitt both admired his familiarity with the public stage.  He \u2018played upon \nthe imagination of the French people\u2019 said Scott (1834-6: XII, 304); while in \u2018On \nEgoism\u2019, Hazlitt distinguishes between base vanity and Napoleon\u2019s gift for self-\nglorification (1930:  XII, 166).  Shelley\u2019s \u2018Political Greatness\u2019 investigates how \ntyranny overwhelms all around it, seeking to find its own reflection wherever it turns, \n\u2018staining that Heaven with obscene imagery \/ Of [its] own likeness\u2019.  This is a more \nradical argument, for it suggests that Napoleon does not merely interpret his own \nimage, he interprets surroundings in terms of himself:  an argument which seems \nplausible given his tendency to name things after himself (the Louvre became the \nMus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on).  However, while enthralled by this mastery, the Romantics also \nnote, and exploit, Bonaparte\u2019s lack of image-control:  Byron accuses him of \u2018losing \nhimself in his dramatic character\u2019 \u2013 preferring performance over action (1973-94:  IV, \n27). \n      \nJust as Napoleon interprets himself, and allows himself to be interpreted, so the \nRomantics impose their own concerns onto him:  from the religiosity of late Coleridge \nand Wordsworth, to the radical sympathies of Hazlitt.  Although they are interested in \n\u2018Napoleon the man\u2019, they are more concerned with how he can be attached to \nRomantic \u2018idea(l)s\u2019 and other intellectual preoccupations.  Befitting their ambiguity \ntowards Bonaparte, the Romantics seek to imitate his methods of image manipulation \nand to control that self-presentation.  Such aims might appear unconscious, in that \nthey are rarely openly discussed, but the trend was noticeable to Romantic \ncontemporaries.  In his Historic Doubts Relative to Napoleon Bonaparte, Richard \nWhately acknowledges the created personae of Napoleon, satirically arguing that he is \nan entirely invented figure, conjured by writers to fulfil ideological purposes.  \nWhately does not discuss specifically Romantic appropriations of Bonaparte, but he \n 22\ndoes demonstrate how easy it is to construct myths around the Emperor, by, for \ninstance, pretending that \u2018Napoleon\u2019 was a common term of praise for generals, \nmeaning \u2018Lion in the Forest\u2019.   He reminds us how concerns of the onlooker, not the \nconduct of the subject, colour perceptions of Napoleon (Whately, 1985:  39).  This \nseems a strikingly (post)modern thesis, recalling Said\u2019s assertion that no full \ncomprehension of \u2018reality\u2019 exists, there is only \u2018representation\u2019 or \u2018interpretation\u2019 of \nreality.  Ronald Paulson\u2019s ideas also follow Whately\u2019s lead.  He applies \nWittgenstein\u2019s maxim \u2018Don\u2019t ask for the meaning, ask for the use\u2019 to eighteenth-\ncentury aesthetics, investigating what depictions of the Revolution do in a political \nsense, rather than what they signify (Paulson, 1983:  5).  In this sense, it is unhelpful \nto over-emphasise the ambiguity of Napoleon\u2019s appropriations since they are \nemployed for very specific agendas.  Paulson is indebted to postmodern uncertainties, \nbut wary of exaggerating ambiguity for its own sake. \n \nNapoleon and the \u2018Imposition Problem\u2019 \nThis, however, does not end the story:  there is a further reason for Romantic interest \nin Napoleon, related not to what they think, but how.  Hazlitt hints at this in his essay \n\u2018On Means and Ends\u2019: \nWhen Buonaparte fell, an English editor exhausted a great number of the \nfinest passages in Paradise Lost, in applying them to his ill-fated ambition.  \nThis was an equal compliment to the poet and the conqueror:  to the last, for \nhaving realised a conception of himself in the mind of his enemies on a par \nwith the most stupendous creations of imagination; to the first for having \nembodied in fiction what bore so strong a resemblance to the fearsome reality. \n(1930:  XVII, 221) \nHazlitt recognises the degree of fictionalisation surrounding Napoleon\u2019s image.  But \nparadoxically, he also implies that this presentation goes beyond fiction and hints at \nreality:  images of Bonaparte are not just impositions; he realises those \u2018creations of \nimagination\u2019.  What Hazlitt implicitly discusses is whether ideas of Napoleon, no \nmatter how embellished, are founded in perception of his conduct; or whether they are \nentirely the invention of an imagining mind.  This cuts to the heart of the Romantic \n\u2018imposition problem\u2019.  \u2018Imposition\u2019 occurs when an observer ignores the objective \ndetails of a scene or circumstance and instead imposes his or her ideas and feelings \nonto it:  he sees what he wants to see, depending on mood and perspective.  When the \n 23\nRomantics derive inspiration from something (typically nature, but also literature, \nother people etc.), do they perceive agency external to them \u2013 the pantheistic Spirit of \nNature, for example, or the genius of an esteemed author?  Or is this idea of \nperception an illusion:  is the significance of a scene imposed, not discerned \u2013 the \ninvention of the observer\u2019s mind. \n \nThis inquiry concerning the validity of their own insights obsesses the Romantics \u2013 it \ncauses crises of confidence, and introspective worries about their own capabilities.  In \nWordsworth\u2019s \u2018Home at Grasmere\u2019 (MS B text [see Wordsworth, 1984]), the narrator \nis aware of such impositional dangers when he asks \u2018Did we come hither, with \nromantic hope \/ To find in midst of so much loveliness \/ Love, perfect love\u2019 (400-2).  \nHe insists that his wish to find \u201cloveliness\u201d has not led to him artificially imposing it \non Nature.  Later, his doubts are stronger \u2013 in a passage asserting the \u2018majesty and \nbeauty and repose\u2019 of the environment, the narrator asks in an aside \u2018(or is it fancy?)\u2019 \n(155). These words undercut his certainty, implying that his own imagination has \nsuperimposed these qualities onto his surroundings.   Shelley\u2019s Alastor raises similar \nquestions.  The Poet projects his thoughts onto his surroundings and is startled when \n\u2018he looked around. \/ There was no fair fiend near him, not a sight \/ Or sound of awe \nbut his own mind\u2019 (296-8).  Moreover, at line 470, whilst looking into a well, he \nbelieves he has seen a mysterious Spirit, whose eyes \u2018beckon him\u2019.  Only once the \nvision is over, he realises that the experience may have derived from \u2018within his \n[own] soul\u2019. \n \nThe variability of Napoleon\u2019s presentation indicates Romantic reliance on the \n\u2018imposed idea\u2019 \u2013 the imagination adding to external observation.  Wordsworth\u2019s 1805 \nPrelude indicates how closely Napoleon and the imposition problem are connected.  \nBook VI relates how, when Wordsworth first saw Mt Blanc, he \u2018grieved \/ To have a \nsoulless image on the eye \/ Which had usurped upon a living thought\u2019 (453-5, my \nitalics).  In other words, Wordsworth\u2019s imaginative configuration, and his actual \nperception, of the scene are disengaged.  As Alan Liu\u2019s research shows, this section \nwas written immediately after Napoleon\u2019s \u2018seizure\u2019 of the crown, and alludes to his \nAlpine adventure (1989:  24-7).  Wordsworth thus deliberately connects Bonaparte\u2019s \nusurpation with his own imposition of the imagination:  Napoleon, like the poet, \nimposes and is imposed upon.  Coleridge makes the theme more explicit.  In \n 24\nBiographia Literaria, he distinguishes between the \u2018absolute genius\u2019, who is secure \nand disciplined; and the Napoleonic \u2018commanding genius\u2019, who knows no \u2018inner \npeace\u2019 and satisfies himself only through \u2018constant, ceaseless imposition of his will \nupon the outside world\u2019 (Calleo, 1960:  83-93).  Coleridge characterises Napoleon as \nan imposer \u2013 unconsciously suffering from the same intellectual problem that plagued \nthe Romantics.  Moreover, he connects Napoleon with theories of the Imagination.  \nThe reason for his enduring appeal, Coleridge says, is his ability to \u2018engage the \nimaginations of men\u2019, to heighten an observer\u2019s inventive sensitivity with his deeds \nand posturing. Indeed, the imagination depends upon such extremity of experience to \nfunction at its most potent (1978:  II, 75 and 150).  The Romantic \u2018idea of Napoleon\u2019 \nand concepts of the \u2018Imagination\u2019 are thus fused together:  in Coleridge\u2019s and \nWordsworth\u2019s cases, exploration of the former frames and informs discussion of the \nlatter.  Still more radically, these speculations show how Romantic notions of \ninternational relations are related to their most theoretical aesthetic interests. \n \nConclusion \nBritish Romantics therefore use Napoleon as an instrument to explore ideas important \nto them \u2013 not merely politics, but also metaphysics and philosophy of history.  \nHowever, they grow increasingly self-conscious about this practice \u2013 the act of \nappropriation \u2013 and the more philosophical (Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley) connect \nNapoleonic imposition to their own thought processes.  Napoleon, or rather the image \nof Napoleon, indicates not only what the Romantics think, but also how they explain \nand critique these thoughts.  He reveals not just opinions and ideas, but the process of \nthinking, of formulating those ideas.  In this way, they each create their own \nNapoleon(s) \u2013 but that created image lays bare the glories and failures of the writers \nthemselves.  They metaphorically imprison Napoleon and use him for their \nintellectual ends, but as with Frankenstein, their prisoner \/ creation both inspires and \ntorments.  Referring to Napoleon\u2019s imperial success and subsequent incarceration, \nByron calls him \u2018Conqueror and Captive of the earth\u2019 (Childe Harold, canto III stanza \n37).  Appropriated for many diverse ends, Bonaparte is indeed \u2018captive\u2019 of Romantic \nimaginations \u2013 a public figure at the mercy of intellectuals.  However, such is the hold \nhe exerts over the Romantics, and such is the introspectiveness he inspires, that he \nalso captivates them:  he is their conqueror.  Romanticism both defines, and is defined \nby, the complex legacy of Napoleon. \n 25\n  References \n \nAlexander, R.S. (2001) Napoleon.
