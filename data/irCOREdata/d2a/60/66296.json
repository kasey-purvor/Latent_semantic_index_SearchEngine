Introduction 41 \nThermal models predict that hydrated basalt in subducted ocean crust is too cold to melt 42 \nwhen it lies beneath the volcanic arc of most modern subduction zones [1,2]. While some 43 \nmodels incorporate melting of subducted crust [3], the geochemistry of arc lavas indicates 44 \n(i) that devolatilisation is the main mechanism transferring material out of the slab, and 45 \n(ii) that the overlying mantle wedge is, volumetrically, the major source of arc lavas [4-46 \n7]. Partial melting of subducted crust should leave a garnet-bearing residue [8,9], 47 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 3 \nproducing magmas with intermediate SiO2, elevated Al2O3, Sr\/Y and La\/Y, and low Y. 48 \nRocks of this type, which have become known as adakites, have been generated in active 49 \nsubduction zones where young ocean crust is subducted (<25Ma). This observation has 50 \nbeen interpreted as evidence that young ocean crust is more prone to melting than older 51 \ncrust because it retains a greater proportion of its initial heat [10]. 52 \nConstraining the origin of modern adakites is important for several reasons. First, the 53 \npresence of adakitic rocks implies an unusual thermal regime compared to most modern 54 \nsubduction zones. Second, many major and trace element characteristics of adakites 55 \nresemble tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite genisses, which are important components in 56 \nArchean terranes. Therefore, modern adakitic magmatism may provide an analogue for 57 \ncontinental growth processes in the early Earth [11-14]. Finally, several suites of adakitic 58 \nrocks are associated with porphyry and epithermal style Cu-, Au-mineralization [15-17]. 59 \nWhile the metallogenic significance of this link is contested [18-20] the association offers 60 \nto shed light on the thermal and dynamic state of subduction zones that host such 61 \ndeposits. 62 \nSince their first description as products of melting young slab [10], increasing numbers of 63 \nadakitic suites have been recognized that were emplaced where the subducted crust was 64 \nold, and thus inferred to be cold. This observation has two possible implications for the 65 \nslab-melting hypothesis. The first possibility is that certain exceptional subduction zone 66 \ngeometries permit melting of subducted basaltic rocks which are greater than 25 million 67 \nyears of age. Several such mechanisms have been advanced including melting the leading 68 \nedges of newly subducted slabs [21], shear heating of slab interiors that are exposed along 69 \nfracture zones [22], or prolonged slab residence in the shallow mantle as a result of 70 \ndecreasing angle of subduction [23]. Each of these \u201ccool slab\u201d models appeals to a unique 71 \nthermal structure and slab melting mechanism for the subduction zone in question. 72 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 4 \nThe alternative implication is that melting of subducted crust does not generate all, or 73 \neven any, adakitic magma. For example, arc crust that is sufficiently thick for garnet to be 74 \nstable in basaltic rock is proposed as a source for adakitic magmatism in the Andes, 75 \nwestern US and Tibet [24-28]. However, this mechanism is not feasible where arc crust is 76 \nless than ~30km thick; the minimum depth of garnet amphibolite or eclogite P-T 77 \nconditions. For arcs with thin crust this has led to the default interpretation that subducted 78 \ncrust is the only part of the subduction zone where basaltic rocks can attain a suitable 79 \nmineralogy to act as adakite sources. 80 \nThe Surigao peninsula in Mindanao, the Philippines, hosts adakitic rocks generated 81 \nduring subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate at the Philippine Trench (Fig. 1). This plate 82 \nmargin initiated at ~ 7Ma, to the east of Luzon, since when it has propagated southwards. 83 \nSubduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath Mindanao began in the late Miocene or 84 \nearly Pliocene [29]. The Philippine Sea Plate crust that was subducted beneath Mindanao 85 \nat that time was more than 50 million years old [30] and so was too cold to melt under 86 \nnormal subduction zone conditions [1]. Furthermore, the Surigao crust is relatively thin 87 \nand unlikely to host garnet-bearing basaltic rocks [21]. To account for the presence of 88 \nadakites by slab melting, Sajona et al. [21] required a mechanism to melt the cool slab. In 89 \nany incipient subduction zone a large thermal contrast will exist between the leading edge 90 \nof the new slab and the mantle it penetrates. Numerical simulations indicate that the 91 \nleading edge of a new slab may be heated to melting point, even if it is more than 25 92 \nmillion years old [1]. Therefore, Sajona et al. [21] proposed that the presence of 93 \nPleistocene adakites in Surigao indicates an old slab melting in a very young subduction 94 \nzone, rather than melting of a young slab. 95 \nWe present new geochemical data to test the slab-melt hypothesis in Surigao. Our data 96 \nindicate that the geochemical distinction between these adakites and more normal island 97 \narc lavas (generated by the same subduction zone) result from differentiation of the 98 \nadakites in the garnet stability field. Our model removes the need to postulate several 99 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 5 \ndifferent mechanisms to melt old subducted crust. Instead, adakites can be regarded as 100 \npart of the spectrum of magmas that may be produced by any subduction zone. 101 \n2. Surigao del Norte 102 \nSurigao del Norte lies at the northern extremity of eastern Mindanao (Fig. 1a). The 103 \nbasement consists of ophiolitic rocks overlain by volcanic and sedimentary rocks derived 104 \nfrom a Palaeogene arc [31,32]. In the east, the mountains of the Pacific Cordillera rise 105 \ntowards the south while the western peninsula is dominated by the elongate Malimono 106 \nRidge (Fig. 1b and c). Between these is a low-lying central plain occupied in the south by 107 \nLake Mainit. The plain is separated from the Malimono Ridge by the Philippine Fault, a 108 \nsinistral strike-slip fault extending the length of the Philippine archipelago (Fig. 1a and 109 \nb). To the east, the central plain meets the Pacific Cordillera along Oligo-Miocene reverse 110 \nfaults that show evidence of recent reactivation as normal faults (Fig. 1b). Since initiation 111 \nof the Philippine Fault during the early Pleistocene the central plain has evolved as a 112 \ndown-faulted basin [32]. Extension, and implied lithospheric thinning, to produce the 113 \nbasin could result from transtension across an eastward step in the Philippine Fault south 114 \nof Surigao del Norte [32], from trench-normal extension due to rollback of the new slab 115 \n[33], or from trench-parallel extension due to oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea 116 \nPlate [34]. 117 \n_______________(Figure 1 to be close to this section)________________ 118 \nMagmatic rocks associated with the Philippine Trench are preserved as hybabyssal stocks 119 \nand lava flows throughout the central and western part of Surigao del Norte (Fig. 1b). 120 \nIntrusive relationships with sedimentary units and radiometric dating [31] indicate that 121 \nmagmatism in the eastern part of the peninsula occurred from the very latest Miocene into 122 \nthe Pliocene. Magmatism from the Quaternary cone of Mt. Maniayao and further to the 123 \nwest (Fig. 1b) is Pleistocene or younger [31]. Major and trace element concentrations and 124 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 6 \nSr and Nd isotopic ratios were determined for a new suite of rocks that includes both 125 \nPliocene and Pleistocene suites (Fig. 1b; see Supplementary Data). 126 \n3. Results 127 \nLate Miocene to Pliocene rocks, hereafter called the Pliocene arc, are island arc basaltic 128 \nandesite and andesite (Fig. 2, 3 and 4a). The Pleistocene igneous rocks display 129 \ncharacteristics typical of adakites, such as intermediate SiO2 contents, elevated Al2O3, 130 \nhigh Sr\/Y, and low Y and heavy rare earth element (HREE) concentrations (Table 1; Figs. 131 \n2-4). However, Sr is not the only incompatible trace element that is enriched relative to 132 \nPliocene rocks with similar SiO2; all elements except Y and the HREEs are enriched by 133 \nsimilar amounts (Fig. 4a,b). Within the Pliestocene suite it is the depletion in Y that is the 134 \nmajor control on the development of the adakitic signature (Fig. 2d,e, Fig. 4a). The 135 \nstrength of the adakite signature is highly variable within the suite and correlates with 136 \nsilica (Figs. 3a-c and 4b). There is also a geographic control on composition; the adakitic 137 \nsignal is strongest in the west and decreases towards Mt. Maniayao (Fig. 3e and f). 138 \n___________(Figures 2, 3 and 4 to be close to this section)____________ 139 \n87Sr\/86Sr and 143Nd\/144Nd display similar, limited ranges in the Pleistocene and Pliocene 140 \nrocks. Both are distinct from the upper mantle beneath Mindanao, which is believed to 141 \nresemble I-MORB [35], and from the composition of unleached, altered basalt drilled 142 \nfrom the Philippine Sea Plate immediately outboard of the Philippine Trench (Fig. 5). 143 \n4. Discussion 144 \nThe strength of the adakite signature in Pleistocene rocks shows significant variation. 145 \nLarge ranges in Sr\/Y are common to several adakitic suites [e.g. 10,21,24,36], however, 146 \nthe correlation with, and wide range of, SiO2 suggests that the adakite signal at Surigao (i) 147 \nwas diluted by a more mafic component, (ii) varyed in response to changing degrees of 148 \nslab melting, or (iii) developed from a more mafic, arc-like magma or basaltic protolith. If 149 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 7 \nthe last possibility is true then adakitic magmas can be developed without the need to 150 \ninvoke slab melting. 151 \n4.1 Modification of Adakitic Slab Melts 152 \nTwo mechanisms could modify the composition of true slab melts towards those of arc 153 \nlavas. Slab melts could mix with contemporaneous arc lavas or they could interact with 154 \nmafic or ultramafic rocks during transport from their source to the surface. 155 \nMixing between a strongly adakitic magma and a more mafic island arc magma (low 156 \nSiO2, Sr\/Y and La\/Y, and high MgO) is precluded on three counts. First, magma mixing 157 \nshould produce straight arrays in binary plots. However, Al2O3, the light rare earth 158 \nelements and Sr display inflections at around 60 wt.% SiO2 (Fig. 2b,d,f). Second, adakitic 159 \nrocks are more common in the west of the peninsula while arc lavas occur in the east (Fig 160 \n3e and f). This observation conflicts with models based on theory or experimental data, 161 \nwhich predict that partial melting of subducted crust should occur closer to the trench 162 \nthan the fluid-fluxed melting of the mantle wedge which produces typical arc magmas [8-163 \n10,36]. Finally, if the adakitic melts had interacted with arc magma then they should 164 \npossess isotopic characteristics intermediate between those of the slab and arc lavas. 165 \nFigure 5 demonstrates that the adakites are entirely distinct from Philippine Sea Plate 166 \ncrust and that their 87Sr\/86Sr and 143Nd\/144Nd ratios are very similar to Pliocene arc rocks. 167 \nIn making this comparison we have deliberately chosen data for basaltic rocks from the 168 \nshallow crust of the Philippine Sea Plate that were not acid-leached prior to analysis, as 169 \nthese will most accurately represent the subducted crust. Using analyses of acid-leached 170 \nbasalt from the slab would only increase the discrepancy between the slab and adakitic 171 \ncompositions. Furthermore, 87Sr\/86Sr tends to decrease with depth in altered oceanic crust 172 \n[37,38]. If slab melts are produced as average of melt fractions from the upper and lower 173 \ncrust [39] then they should have even lower 87Sr\/86Sr than the shallowest lavas. The 174 \nisotopic differences between adakites and slab suggest that the former are not derived 175 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 8 \ndirectly from the latter. Instead, both Pliocene and Pleistocene rocks are displaced to high 176 \n87Sr\/86Sr relative to the 143Nd\/144Nd of the upper mantle (Fig. 5). In conjunction with the 177 \nsimilarities of all trace element ratios, except those involving Y and the HREEs (Fig. 4a), 178 \nthis suggests both the adakitic and arc suites are ultimately derived from similar sources. 179 \nThe second means of changing slab melt composition is assimilation of rocks from the 180 \nmantle or crust. With respect to SiO2 the Surigao adakites possess high mg-numbers 181 \n(Table 1) and are relatively rich in elements that are abundant in peridotite, such as MgO 182 \n(Fig. 2a) and Ni. Similar characteristics have been interpreted as evidence of melt-mantle 183 \ninteraction in other adakitic suites [14,40]. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that 184 \nvariable interaction between slab-derived adakite and peridotite should produce suites of 185 \nsilicic magma in which SiO2 correlates positively with Al2O3 and negatively with Na2O 186 \nor K2O. This is because assimilation involves precipitation of orthopyroxene, depleting 187 \nthe melt in silica but enriching it in incompatible elements [41]. Neither of these 188 \nrelationships is observed in the Surigao adakites. Indeed there is a strong positive 189 \ncorrelation between silica and K2O (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, reaction between silicic melt 190 \nand peridotite can modify trace element concentrations in the hybridized melts but has a 191 \nnegligible effect on ratios of incompatible trace elements [41]. Therefore, even if such 192 \nreaction had modified SiO2 and MgO in some Surigao adakites it would not have a 193 \nsignificant effect on key ratios such as Sr\/Y and La\/Y. The correlations in Figure 3a-c 194 \nsuggest that the major and trace element systematics of the adakites result from a 195 \ncommon process, and not one that can leave little imprint on incompatible trace element 196 \nratios. 197 \n_______________(Figure 5 close to this section)________________ 198 \nSr and Nd isotopic data are also inconsistent with a major role for interaction between 199 \nslab melt and mantle wedge. Mantle peridotite beneath the Philippines has lower 87Sr\/86Sr 200 \nthan the subducted Philippine Sea Plate at similar 143Nd\/144Nd. Slab melts interacting with 201 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 9 \nthis wedge would have their compositions driven towards lower 87Sr\/86Sr, i.e. away from 202 \nthose of Surigao adakites (Fig. 5). The mantle wedge may have been modified by slab-203 \nderived fluids during earlier phases of subduction, but it is unlikely that any peridotitic 204 \nlithology would contain sufficient Sr to buffer 87Sr\/86Sr in the adakites, which are 205 \nparticularly rich in Sr (Fig. 2d). Any contaminant would require even higher Sr contents 206 \n(>1200ppm) to influence 87Sr\/86Sr whilst having a negligible effect on other aspects of 207 \nmelt chemistry (Fig. 4a). 208 \nThere is insufficient control on the isotopic composition of the Surigao basement to 209 \nunequivocally dismiss the possibility that these isotope ratios have been modified by 210 \nassimilation of crustal rocks. However, 87Sr\/86Sr and 143Nd\/144Nd do not correlate with 211 \nSiO2 or MgO as would be predicted if crustal rocks were assimilated during 212 \ndifferentiation. Furthermore, a contaminant with exceptionally high Sr, and Sr\/Nd, would 213 \nagain be required to displace the isotope ratios of true slab melts away from those of the 214 \nPhilippine Sea Plate (Fig. 5). 215 \n4.2 Variable Melting of the Philippine Sea Plate 216 \nLow degree partial melts of hydrous basalt are rich in SiO2 and alkalis but poor in MgO 217 \nand FeO [8,9]. As melting progresses silica and alkalis in the melt are diluted and the 218 \nconcentrations of ferromagnesian components increase. The Surigao suite displays these 219 \ncharacteristics (Fig. 2a-c) so may result from variable degrees of partial melting of 220 \nsubducted basalt crust. However, the trace element and isotopic characteristics are not 221 \nconsistent with this origin. Basaltic rocks from the Philippine Sea Plate contain too little 222 \nSr to replicate the trace element variation observed in the Surigao suite. Even doubling 223 \nthe Sr content of the subducted basalt, to simulate seafloor alteration [8,38], results in Sr \u2013 224 \nY variation unlike that observed at Surigao, or in any putative slab melts (short dashed 225 \nline, Fig. 3d). 226 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 10 \n87Sr\/86Sr and 143Nd\/144Nd data also suggest that Surigao adakites were not generated by 227 \nmelting of Philippine Sea Plate crust. Variations in partial melting would have a 228 \nnegligible impact on the Sr and Nd isotopic ratios of the magmas produced. Instead of 229 \nresembling the subducted slab, the Surigao adakites are most similar to Pliocene arc lavas 230 \n(Section 4.1). Slab melting is also inconsistent with osmium isotope data [42]. The high 231 \nRe\/Os ratios of ocean floor basalt mean that, at more than 50 million years old, the 232 \nPhilippine Sea Plate crust should have developed extremely high 187Os\/188Os, which 233 \nwould also be passed on to slab melts. In fact, the majority of Surigao adakitic rocks 234 \npossess 187Os\/188Os within the range of most island arc lavas [42]. 235 \n4.3 Adakite production from Arc Basalt 236 \nIncompatible trace element ratios and isotopic characteristics of the Pleistocene rocks are 237 \nsimilar to those of Pliocene arc lavas except for extreme depletion of Y and the HREEs 238 \n(Fig. 4b). Y and the HREE are strongly correlated with SiO2 (Fig. 2e and 4b). Since, (i) 239 \nmagma mixing, assimilation of mantle or crust, and variable slab melting cannot 240 \nsatisfactorily explain the geochemistry of the adakites, and (ii) the isotopic data suggest 241 \nthat the Pliocene and Pleistocene rocks ultimately share a source in mantle wedge, we 242 \nconclude that the adakitic signature of the Pliocene rocks was produced either by solid 243 \nfractionation from arc magma, or by partial melting of arc magma that had completely 244 \nsolidified. 245 \nPlagioclase is by far the most abundant phenocryst in the adakitic rocks (25-50%), 246 \nfollowed by hornblende (10-15%), with trace quantities of biotite, Fe-Ti oxide and 247 \nclinopyroxene. Differentiation of an amphibole-dominated assemblage has been proposed 248 \nas a mechanism to produce adakitic rocks on Camiguin Island, north of Mindanao [43], 249 \nbut a plagioclase-amphibole assemblage is unable to reproduce the trace element 250 \nsignature of the Surigao suite. In particular, removal of these phases would produce 251 \nconcave-upwards patterns between the middle and heavy rare earth elements (Fig. 4c) and 252 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 11 \nresult in decreasing Dy\/Yb with increasing SiO2. The increase of Dy\/Yb with 253 \ndifferentiation (Fig. 3c) requires that a phase with DYb > DDy, such as garnet, was 254 \ninvolved in the development of the adakitic signature. The rare earth element patterns are 255 \nconsistent with fractionation of an assemblage containing clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, 256 \ngarnet and amphibole in proportions similar to those crystallised in basaltic melt at 257 \n1.2GPa (Fig. 4c; [44]). Crystallisation of a small quantity of a light rare earth element-258 \nbearing phase, such as allanite, is also required to account for the depletion of La and Ce 259 \nin the most silica-rich compositions (Figs. 2f and 4). Employing Pliocene arc lava as a 260 \nstarting composition suggests that 30% to 50% crystallisation of the high pressure 261 \nassemblage is sufficient to produce the the Surigao suite (solid line, Fig. 3d). 262 \nAlternatively, adakitic rocks may be produced by remelting arc magma that solidified at 263 \ndepths where garnet was stable. Garnet and amphibole may crystallise from basaltic melt 264 \nat high pressure (see above; [44]) or may develop during isobaric cooling of rocks 265 \nemplaced slightly shallower than the depth where garnet becomes a liquidus phase [45]. 266 \nAs already noted, major element variations in the Surigao suite closely resemble andesite 267 \nand dacite compositions generated in the laboratory by isobaric melting of hydrous 268 \nmetabasalt over a range of temperatures (Fig. 2a-c). Remelting arc lava, which contains 269 \nmore Sr (and other trace elements) than ocean floor basalt, produces a better fit to adakitic 270 \nSr - Y systematics than melting subducted ocean crust (long dash line, Fig. 3d) but 271 \nrequires extremely high degrees (>50%) of batch melting with residual garnet, amphibole 272 \nand pyroxene (Fig. 3d). Such high degrees of melting may not generate adakite if garnet 273 \nis a minor component of the source, c.f. [44], although there is experimental evidence that 274 \ngarnet is precipitated during low degrees of partial melting of hydrous basalt [8,9]. 275 \nCastillo et al. [43] suggested that shallow, amphibole-dominated differentiation of arc 276 \nlavas may generate some Philippine adakites. Remelting basaltic rock in thick, garnet-277 \nbearing crust has been proposed as a mechanism for generating adakitic magma from arc 278 \nlithosphere [24-28]. Furthermore, garnet-, amphibole-bearing rocks have been 279 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 12 \ndocumented from basal sections of exhumed arc crust in the Aleutian arc and Kohistan, 280 \nwhere Moho depths are estimated to have been \u2265 30km [45-47]. The Surigao example is 281 \ndistinct from these models in revealing a strong garnet fractionation signature in 282 \nmagmatism associated with relatively thin arc crust. Therefore, our data require that 283 \nadakitic compositions were generated as a result of basaltic melt crystallising within the 284 \nmantle. 285 \nA case can be made, based on simple buoyancy arguments, that basaltic melt should not 286 \npond until it reaches the Moho, which in arcs with crust less than ~ 35km thick is too 287 \nshallow for garnet crystallisation. However, Stratford and Stern [48] have imaged a strong 288 \nseismic reflection and large drop in shear wave velocities at 35km depth beneath the 289 \nTaupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, where the crust is less than 20km thick. They 290 \ninterpret this anomaly as a rising diapir of melt or a melt body trapped at a thermal 291 \nboundary layer within the mantle. Basic arc magma provides the most likely candidate for 292 \na liquid body at this depth. A stalled diaper or melt body implies a mechanical and\/or 293 \nrheological barrier impeding further upward migration. Whether such a barrier lies within 294 \nthe arc lithosphere or marks a boundary between arc lithosphere and the underlying, 295 \nconvecting mantle is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the presence of substantial 296 \nmelt volumes within the shallow mantle wedge is consistent with the inferences from the 297 \nSurigao geochemical data. At 35km basaltic arc magma will crystallise a garnet-bearing 298 \nassemblage. As discussed above this, in turn, will produce either silicic differentiated 299 \nliquid with adakitic chemistry, or garnet-bearing mafic rock that could remelt to yield 300 \nadakitic magma. In either case, during transport from the locus of crystallisation to the 301 \nMoho the adakitic magma produced will have the opportunity to interact with mantle 302 \nperidotite and acquire the elevated MgO, Ni and Cr concentrations and mg-numbers 303 \nobserved at Surigao and in other adakite suites [14]. 304 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 13 \n4.4 Adakite Production  in the East Philippine Arc 305 \nSurigao\u2019s low-lying central plain (Fig. 1c) is a young rift or transtensional feature [32], so 306 \nthe temperature at any depth beneath the plain will be higher than at the same depth 307 \nfurther west, on the rift margin (Fig. 6). The strong spatial control on the composition of 308 \nSurigao adakites infers that the temperature of solid \u2013 melt equilibrium increases from the 309 \nwest coast to the central plain (Fig. 3e and f). Lower geothermal gradients at the rift 310 \nmargin may allow more extensive crystallisation of magma here than is the case in the 311 \ncentral part of the rift. Similarly, if remelting is responsible for adakite generation, then 312 \nmelting temperatures will be higher beneath the central plain than at a similar depth 313 \nbeneath the rift margins (Fig. 6). Therefore, Pleistocene thinning of the overriding plate 314 \nprovides a single mechanism to produce both the rifted morphology of the peninsula and 315 \nthe geographic control on melt chemistry. 316 \n4.5 Implications for Other Adakite Suites  317 \nFigure 6 summarises the mechanisms by which adakitic magma may be generated from 318 \narc basalt via crystallisation in the mantle wedge. This model has several important 319 \nimplications for petrogenesis of other adakitic magmatic suites. 320 \n_______________(Figure 6 here)________________ 321 \nFirst, adakitic magma can be derived from primitive arc magma, which is consistent with 322 \n\u03b418O values of adakites. Oceanic lithosphere and sediment are very heterogeneous in \u03b418O 323 \n[38,49-51], therefore, similar diversity would be predicted for melts derived from 324 \nsubducted slabs. However, adakitic rocks display a narrow range of \u03b418O values [39] 325 \nextending only slightly higher than other subduction zone magmatic rocks [51-55]. 326 \nPyroxene, garnet and amphibole all have lower \u03b418O values than silicate melt with which 327 \nthey are in equilibrium [39,56]. Fractionation of these phases from magma, either by 328 \nfractional crystallisation or partial melting, will produce a small increase in \u03b418O values of 329 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 14 \nthe differentiated melts. This is more consistent with the limited oxygen isotopic variation 330 \nin adakitic rocks than the fortuitous balance of sources required during melting of 331 \ndifferent slabs, each displaying its own diverse \u03b418O distribution. 332 \nIf adakitic magma can be produced from any primitive arc melt, why are adakites not 333 \nmore common in more arcs? The architecture, rheology and thermal structure of a 334 \nsubduction zone will control the extent to which deep crystallisation may occur and be 335 \noverprinted by later differentiation. In Surigao, deep differentiation is recorded while 336 \nshallow crystallisation appears to have had a negligible impact on geochemistry of the 337 \nadakites. In contrast, the Pliocene rocks are typical arc lavas and do not record deep 338 \nprocessing. This difference could reflect changes in magma plumbing across the arc with 339 \ndeeper ponding favoured at greater distance from the arc. Alternatively, variations in the 340 \nmagma flux through the arc could be responsible. An extensive magma plumbing system 341 \nin mature arc crust will decrease the probability that the signature of deep crystallisation 342 \nwill survive shallow crystallisation, magma mixing or interaction with the crust itself 343 \n(Fig. 6). In eastern Mindanao (or, indeed much of the eastern Philippines) there is 344 \ncurrently no active volcanism associated with subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate, 345 \nsuggesting low melt productivity from the mantle wedge. The Pleistocene adakites were 346 \nthe last magmatic event to affect Surigao and so represent a waning melt flux to the crust. 347 \nEphemeral magmatism during the earliest stages of magmatism may, therefore, be 348 \nconducive to creating conditions under which adakitic magmas can avoid further 349 \ndifferentiation, and loss of their distinctive character, at shallower levels. A component 350 \nwith \u201cslab fusion\u201d characteristics has also been invoked in rocks generated in the nascent 351 \nIzu-Bonin arc [57] but may, in fact, represent remobilisation of basaltic rock emplaced 352 \nduring earlier phases of subduction [30,58]. If differentiation in the mantle is responsible 353 \nfor adakite generation, then the link between young subducted lithosphere and those 354 \nadakites identified by Drummond and Defant [10] could reflect the thermal and dynamic 355 \neffect of young slabs on the shallow mantle wedge and overriding lithosphere, rather than 356 \nmelting of the slab itself. 357 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 15 \nSecond, our conclusions indicate that unusually hot subducted slabs are not a pre-358 \nrequisite of adakitic magmatism. The elegance of the original adakite model [10] was that 359 \neach adakitic suite was linked by the common denominator of a young slab, which was 360 \ninferred to be hot. Subsequent recognition of adakites associated with old slabs has 361 \nbroken this simple link but thrown up several exceptions to the rule. Each new case 362 \nrequires its own mechanism for heating old, cold slab to melting point. Two extreme 363 \nexamples of the absence of a hot slab are (i) genesis of adakitic magma where the slab is 364 \nat very great depth [59], or (ii) genesis of adakites without any slab at the time of 365 \nmagmatism [60-62]. The alternative to having several exceptions to the rule is to have a 366 \nnew rule. Basalt that crystallises in the lithospheric mantle (Stage 2, Fig. 6) will remain 367 \npart of the lithosphere until later perturbations of the geothermal gradient. Partial melting 368 \nof arc basalt stored in the lithospheric mantle would still result in adakitic magma 369 \nregardless of the geodynamic process causing the basalt to melt. Non-arc basalts have 370 \ndifferent bulk compositions, lower water contents and less distinctive trace element ratios 371 \nthan those produced in subduction zones. Therefore, their remobilisation from sites of 372 \ndeep crystallisation may not happen so readily or will not produce such distinctive partial 373 \nmelts as those with a subduction zone provenance. 374 \nThird, the shallow mantle may act as a staging-post for at least some primitive magmas in 375 \nsubduction zones [11,62,63]. Evidence for interaction between adakitic melt and 376 \nperidotite has previously been used as evidence that adakites must originate beneath the 377 \nMoho [13,14,22,40] and thus, by inference, in the subducted slab. However, Surigao 378 \ndemonstrates that adakitic magma produced from deeply crystallised basalt must still 379 \ntraverse the uppermost mantle wedge (Stage 3; Fig. 6). Our model infers that mafic to 380 \nultramafic cumulates can develop within the mantle. In turn, this provides a location 381 \nwhere a primary basaltic magma flux into the base of arc lithosphere can generate a 382 \nmagmatic flux into the crust that has a more evolved bulk composition [11,44,46,62]. 383 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 16 \n5. Summary 384 \nPleistocene igneous rocks from Surigao record the development of adakitic melts from 385 \ntypical arc magma by fractionation of a garnet-bearing assemblage. Arc magma stalled 386 \nwithin the mantle, either at the base of the arc lithosphere or at some rheological 387 \nboundary in the shallow mantle wedge. Fractional crystallisation or remelting of the 388 \nstalled material produced the adakites. Our data imply that (i) adakitic magmatism can 389 \noccur in any subduction zone where \u201cnormal\u201d arc magmatism occurs, (ii) adakitic 390 \nmagmatism does not require an unusually hot subducted slab, (iii) adakitic magmatism 391 \ncan be generated out-with active subduction zones, and (iv) that the mantle beneath 392 \nsubduction zones can play an important role in determining the nature of volcanic outputs 393 \nand of crust produced by subduction zones. These conclusions have important 394 \nimplications for interpreting geodynamics of modern adakites and adakite-related rocks 395 \nfound in Archean terranes. 396 \nAcknowledgements 397 \nThe SE Asia Research Group, Royal Holloway University of London, funded much of 398 \nthis work.

The slab is subducted beneath overriding arc lithosphere and induces 656 \ncorner flow (convection) in the mantle wedge. Dashed lines are schematic isotherms (for 657 \nrelatively low (L), medium (M) and high (H) temperature) illustrating that at any depth 658 \nthe shallow mantle is hottest where the arc lithosphere is thinnest [after 2,68-70]. 659 \nNumbers in the vertical column refer to the flow diagram on the right, which summarises 660 \nthe possible mechanisms identified for generating adakitic melt without slab melting. 661 \nStage 1; genesis of primitive arc basalt. Stage 2; high pressure processing of basalt yields 662 \nadakitic magma either directly, by fractional crystallisation, or indirectly, by remelting 663 \ncrystallised basaltic rock. Stage 3; interaction between adakitic magma and mantle 664 \nperidotite. Stage 4; low-pressure crystallisation. Where the crust is thick Stage 2 can 665 \noccur above the Moho and Stage 3 would be bypassed [24-26]. In mature arcs with a high 666 \nmagma flux to the crust Stage 4 will obscure or obliterate adakitic chemistry. 667 \n668 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 24 \n 669 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 25 \n 670 \n671 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 26 \n 672 \n673 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 27 \n 674 \n675 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 28 \n 676 \n677 \nMacpherson, Dreher & Thirlwall: Adakites without slab melting 29 \n 678 \n"}
