The present review will \naddress the important issues of milk feeding practices and \nintroduction of complementary foods with respect to allergy \noutcome and prevention of atopic disease. \nA majority of babies in the UK are born full term (3742  \nweeks), and preterm babies (those born before 37 weeks) \naccount for 4-6 % of the total births, with this number set \nto rise with the development of new medical techniques. \nThe major causes of preterm births are medical, such as \nspontaneous ruptured membranes and hypertension, and \nsocial, such as smoking and alcoholism. The majority \nof babies are breast-fed, although in the preterm infant \ncombination feeding appears to be the most common milk \nfeeding regimen. This involves breast-feeding, with \u2018top-up\u2019 \nformula feeds being given in the hospitals or at home when \nthe infant is nutritionally and physiologically ready for the \nintroduction of complementary foods. \nIntestinal permeability occurs during the neonatal period. \nMore food antigens pass across the gut of preterm infants \nthan full-term infants (Roberton et al. 1982). Early admin- \nistration of antigen delays, while breast-feeding speeds up, \nthe rate of gut closure (Arvola et al. 1992). Immune function \nin the neonate has been assessed by monitoring total \nand specific immunoglobulin E (Hattevig et al. 1993; Sigurs \net al. 1994) and specific immunoglobulin G levels (Falth- \nMagnusson et al. 1988; Lovegrove et al. 1994). Recently, \neosinophilic cationic protein and peripheral-blood mono- \nnuclear responses have been monitored in babies, with some \ninteresting results. Jones et al. (1996) have demonstrated, \nby monitoring proliferation responses, that primary sensiti- \nzation to an allergen occurs as early as week 22 of gestation. \nEosinophilic cationic protein levels have been shown to be \nraised in patients with atopic dermatitis. Motolese et al. \n(1 998) have demonstrated that eosinophilic cationic protein \nmay be a suitable variable for monitoring the severity of \natopic dermatitis in patients. \nModification of diet during pregnancy and lactation \nA number of studies have investigated the role of dietary \nmodification and allergy outcome in infants from atopic \nfamilies. \nCant et al. (1986) studied the effect of eliminating milk \nand eggs from the diets of mothers who were breast-feeding \nCorresponding author: Dr Shelagh M. Hampton, fax 4 4  (0)1483 576978, email s.hampton@surrey.ac.uk \n76 S .  M. Hampton \ntheir infants. The infants had all presented at the hospital \nwith eczema, and this was monitored for extent and severity \nthroughout the study. The mothers were placed on a 12- \nweek diet divided into three periods of 4 weeks. This study \nwas a double-blind crossover design, in which the mothers \neliminated cow's milk, eggs, chocolate, wheat, nuts, fish, \nbeef, citrus h i t s ,  colouring and preservative from their \nnormal diet. They were placed in random order for 4 weeks \non each of two substitute diets (a) soyabean and (b) cow's \nmilk and egg powder, and returned to their normal diet for \n4 weeks at the end of the study. The condition improved in \nsix of the children studied, and Cant et al. (1986) suggested \nthat there was a subgroup of children whose condition was \nimproved when the mothers were on a restricted diet. \nSigurs et al. (1992) extended the studies of Cant et al. \n(1986) by placing mothers on an elimination diet for the first \n3 months of breast-feeding. This observational study \nrecruited 1 15 mothers with a family history of atopic disease \nand divided them into two groups. One group of mothers \navoided cow's milk, fish and eggs during the first 3 months \nof lactation, and the other group kept to their normal diet. \nThe infants were assessed at 3, 6 and 48 months, and a \nsignificantly higher incidence of eczema was observed in \nthe children whose mothers did not follow the elimination \ndiet during lactation (Fig. 1). \nA group of Swedish researchers (Falth-Magnusson & \nKjellman, 1992) investigated 209 mothers with a history of \natopic disease and divided them into two groups. One group \nof mothers eliminated cow's milk and eggs from their diet \nfrom week 28 of pregnancy until delivery, and the other \ngroup adhered to their normal diet. There was no reduction \nin atopic disease in infants when mothers were placed on \nthe elimination diets. However, primary sensitization of \nthe baby has been shown to occur as early as week 22 of \npregnancy, which may explain the lack of reduction \nin atopic disease in the infants whose mothers were in the \nelimination group. \nAn observational study together with monitoring of \nimmunological markers in three groups of mothers was \ncarried out by Lovegrove el al. (1994). One group of \nmothers with a family history of atopic disease and a second \nLc \n0 \n* *  * \nA \nA ~ \n0 3 6  9 12 18 48 \nAge (months) \nFig. 1.

The atopic group was further divided \ninto two subgroups, one of which was placed on an elimin- \nation diet removing cow's milk from the diet from week 36 \nof pregnancy and throughout lactation, while the other \ngroup maintained their normal diet. The children with a \nfamily history of atopic disease had a significantly reduced \nincidence of developing allergies when mothers were placed \non a cow's-milk-free diet (Table 1). \nTo be of any use, elimination diets must begin before \nweek 22 of pregnancy, since Jones et al. (1996) showed that \nprimary sensitization occurs as early as the 2nd trimester. In \na family with a history of atopic disease, placing the mother \non an elimination diet together with breast-feeding of her \ninfant, may have some benefit, but the stress to the mother \nof such a diet may outweigh the advantages. \n*P<  0.04, **P<O.O2, \"'P<0.008. \nIntroduction of complementary foods \nComplementary food is the term used for any food, whether \nmanufactured or locally prepared, which is suitable as a \ncomplement to breast milk or to infant formulas when either \nbecomes insufficient to satisfy the nutritional requirements \nof the infant. Such foods are commonly referred to as wean- \ning foods. \nThe government guidelines on the introduction of \ncomplementary foods state that babies should be breast-fed \nfor the first 4 months of life, with solid foods being \nintroduced thereafter, and a mixed diet should be offered by \nthe age of 6 months (Department of Health, 1994). \nStudies investigating the introduction of complementary \nfood have monitored the types of foods consumed and when \nthey were introduced to the infant, and the allergic outcome \nin the infants. \nKajosaan & Saarinen (1983) investigated 135 children \nfrom atopic families. They divided the infants into two \ngroups; one group were exclusively breast-fed for 6 months, \nand the other group started consuming complementary \nfoods from the age of 3 months. These complementary \nfoods were cooked potatoes, carrots, berries, meat and \ncereals. The incidences of atopic eczema and food allergy at \n1 year of age were monitored and the findings showed that \nNutrition and immunology 77 \n*** \n;; , J , \nS O  \n2 0  \n2% 10 \nFA AE+FA \n0 \nAE \nFig. 2.

(Adapted from Kajosaari & Saarinen, 1983.) \nthe incidences of both disorders were significantly raised in \nthe children who received solid foods after 3 months but \nbefore 6 months of age (Fig. 2). They concluded that \nchildren from atopic families had a reduced risk if they were \nexclusively breast-fed and excluded solid foods for 6 \nmonths. \nResearchers in New Zealand (Fergusson et al. 1990) \ncarried out an observational study in a group of 1210 \nchildren. They assessed the children at 4 months and \nannually for 10 years. They investigated the risk of develop- \ning chronic or recurrent eczema and its relationship with the \nearly introduction of solid foods. They demonstrated that \nchildren exposed initially to four or more types of solid \nfoods had a 2.35 times greater risk of developing eczema \nthan children not exposed to solid feeding (Table 2). \nFergusson et al. (1990) stated that it was the diet diversity \nand not a particular food that increased the risk of eczema. \nA prospective observational study investigating 67 1 \nchildren in Scotland (Forsyth et al. 1993) monitored infants \nfrom 2 weeks of age, then at regular intervals up to 24 \nmonths. They divided the children into three groups, \ndepending on when solid foods were introduced at less than \n8 weeks, between 8 and 12 weeks, at greater than 12 weeks. \nWhen solid foods were introduced at an early age there \n50 r \nTable 2.

The incidence of atopic eczema was increased at \n53-104 weeks in the group that received solids at between 8 \nand 12 weeks. \nA follow-up study of this same cohort for 7 years (Wilson \net aE. 1998) investigated different feeding patterns. They \nstudied those children who were breast-fed exclusively for \n15 weeks, and those who were breast-fed but also received \nsolid food before 15 weeks. They showed a significant rise \nin the occurrence of wheeze in those children receiving \nsolids before 15 weeks. They concluded that in order to \nreduce the risk of developing allergies breast-feeding should \ncontinue up to 15 weeks and no solid foods should be intro- \nduced before 15 weeks of age. \nA study investigating the weaning practices and inci- \ndence of atopic disease in the preterm baby is being carried \nout currently by our group at the University of Surrey. This \nis an observational study, with immunological markers \nbeing monitored in the breast milk, and serum samples from \nthe cord and the infant. Physical examination of the infants \nis being carried out at 8 and 12 months. Age of weaning \nfrom birth has been studied in 140 infants and shown to \nbe biphasic, with peaks at 12 and 16 weeks (Fig. 3). The \nincidence of atopic disease at 8 and 12 months in seventy \nbabies who have completed the project has been invest- \nigated.

Hampton \ngroups has shown that the pattern of allergies altered, \ndepending on the age of the infants when the physical \nexamination was carried out. Our preliminary results have \nshown that at 8 months babies who were weaned at less than \n15 weeks had a greater risk of developing atopic disease \ncompared with infants who were weaned after 15 weeks. \nHowever, when the same infants were re-examined at 12 \nmonths both early- and late-weaning infants had approx- \nimately the same risk of developing atopic disease. A high \nincidence of atopic eczema was observed. \nIn conclusion, in order to reduce the risk of allergy \ndevelopment infants should be exclusively breast-fed for \nmore than 15 weeks, and solid foods should be introduced at \n15 weeks or later. In the pretenn infant this could be a late as \n6 months postnatal age, although we await further inform- \nation to confirm this observation. When solid foods are \nintroduced, a small selection should be introduced up to \n1 year. \nWhat of the future? The use of hypoallergenic formulas \nin the prevention of atopic disease requires further invest- \nigation, particularly in the preterm infant. Further studies \nshould investigate the introduction of complementary foods \nand finally studies at the molecular level are required to \nestablish the inheritance link. \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries \nand Food for its financial support and Dr Jane Morgan and \nDr Fiona Norris for their valuable contributions when \npreparing this manuscript.
