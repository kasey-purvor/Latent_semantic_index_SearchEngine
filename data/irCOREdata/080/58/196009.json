Ionosphere (Active experiments; Wave propaga-\ntion; Instruments and techniques)\n1 Introduction\nThe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) net-\nwork (Greenwald et al., 1995; Chisham et al., 2007) currently\nconsists of 11 over-the-horizon HF radars in the northern po-\nlar regions and 7 radars in the southern polar regions. Radars\nof this design have been in operation since the early 1980s,\nand currently form a powerful diagnostic of large-scale iono-\nspheric and magnetospheric dynamics in the Northern and\nSouthern Hemispheres. The radars operate between 8 and\n20 MHz, and have fields-of-view which extend in range from\n180 km to over 3000 km in standard operations. The radar\nsystems rely on the refraction of the HF radiation both in\norder to achieve orthogonality to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field,\na requirement for scattering off the ionospheric irregulari-\nties, which form the targets for such radar systems, and to\nachieve backscatter from the longer ranges, which require\nover-the-horizon operations. The ground locations of the HF\nradar returns are routinely determined by a simple rangefind-\ning algorithm, which uses the group delay of the signal and\nan assumed virtual height to map the radar returns, assum-\ning straight-line propagation at the speed of light (see the\ncompanion paper, Chisham et al., 2008, for a fuller discus-\nsion), and thus takes no direct account of the prevailing HF\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n844 T. K. Yeoman et al.: Mapping ionospheric backscatter measured by SuperDARN\npropagation conditions (Baker et al., 1986). In reality these\npropagation conditions are highly variable, with direct ( 12 -\nhop) propagation to E- and F-region ionospheric irregular-\nities, and 1 12 -hop propagation to both the E- and F-region\ncommonly observed by the radar systems.\nA number of approaches are possible in order to improve\nthe mapping of radar backscatter. In general the true height\nof radar echoes is not known. For naturally-occurring radar\ntargets the virtual height appropriate to the unknown real ir-\nregularity height must be substituted by a model altitude, the\npseudo-virtual height. Improvements to such model virtual\nheights formed the subject of Chisham et al. (2008). Al-\nternatively, if radar measurements of the elevation angle are\navailable, then a custom analysis of the HF propagation mode\nmay be performed to directly determine the real height, and\nhence the echo location. A different approach is possible for\nbackscatter generated by a high power RF facility, such as\nthe data examined here, where the true height may be accu-\nrately determined via incoherent scatter radar data, the actual\nlocation of the scatter is known, and the effects of different\nmethods of echo location may be investigated.\nPrevious studies of the mapping of HF radar backscatter\nhave adopted a raytracing simulation (Villain et al., 1984;\nBaker et al., 1986) or velocity field cross correlation (Ruo-\nhoniemi et al., 1987; Andr\u00e9 et al., 1997) approach to assess\nthe accuracy of rangefinding using the straight-line approx-\nimation. These studies suggested agreement between the\nground range and radar range within \u223c15 km over a 12 -hop\npath. Over such relatively short propagation paths, there-\nfore, the existing rangefinding algorithm is clearly adequate.\nHowever mapping errors are expected to become more sig-\nnificant for longer paths where the roundness of the Earth be-\ncomes important, and a correct assumption of virtual height\nbecomes more difficult.\nEarly studies with HF radars either used HF radar data\nalone, or combined HF radar data with data from instru-\nments such as ground magnetometers, which had a limited\nspatial resolution and are often only available from arrays\nwhich are sparsely populated in comparison to radar fields-\nof-view. However the growing importance of combined\nground-spacecraft measurements and multi-instrument stud-\nies from the ground have led to numerous coordinated studies\nwith instruments of a high spatial resolution, such as merid-\nian scanning photometers, all sky cameras and auroral im-\nagers. In these studies the location of the radar backscatter is\na crucial element in the study. In addition, spacecraft over-\npasses, where the magnetic conjugate points are computed\nto a high precision using geomagnetic field models, require\nhigh accuracy in the location of the HF radar backscatter. For\nexample optical signatures associated with dayside reconnec-\ntion have been extensively investigated from the ground in\nvisible light at wavelengths of 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm as-\nsociated with auroral activity (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1996) at\na high spatial resolution. In association with these optical\ntransients, HF radars observe pulsed ionospheric flows in the\ncusp region (e.g. Pinnock et al. 1995). Such radar and opti-\ncal signatures may be observed simultaneously (Yeoman et\nal., 1997a), but the interpretation of such studies requires\nan accurate evaluation of radar range. A plethora of recent\nmulti-instrument studies of, for example, convection reversal\nboundaries (e.g. Sotirelis et al., 2005), spectral width bound-\naries (e.g. Chisham et al., 2005), spacecraft conjunctions\n(e.g. McWilliams et al., 2004), high resolution ground-based\nauroral images (e.g. Lockwood et al., 2003) and incoherent\nscatter radar observations (e.g. Blanchard et al., 2003) all rely\ncritically on an accurate evaluation of the true ground range\nof HF coherent backscatter returns, often over the long prop-\nagation paths where accurate mapping becomes more diffi-\ncult. Yeoman et al. (2001) performed a preliminary evalua-\ntion of the absolute rangefinding accuracy of current routine\nanalysis of the SuperDARN network of over-the-horizon HF\nradars comparing the ground range, calculated group path\nand measured radar slant range of backscatter artificially ex-\ncited by the EISCAT heating facility at Troms\u00f8. HF propaga-\ntion over a 12 -hop path, a 1\n1\n2 -hop path and a 2\n1\n2 -hop path were\nexamined. The radar slant range and the calculated group\npaths were found to be in excellent agreement for all three\npaths, with the standard algorithm for backscatter ground\nrange location accurate to within 16 km and 114 km for 12 -\nhop and 1 12 -hop backscatter, respectively, when using the\ntrue backscatter height. These range offsets were extremely\nconsistent. The analysis of Yeoman et al. (2001) suggested\nthat high elevation angle backscatter should be interpreted\nwith caution.\nIn this paper HF radar backscatter which has been\nartificially-induced at a precisely known location by high\npower RF facilities at Troms\u00f8 and on Svalbard are used to\nprovide a range accuracy evaluation for the SuperDARN\nradars. The location of the artificial irregularities is deter-\nmined through the combination of the beam direction of\nthe high power RF facilities and the ionospheric interaction\nheight of the RF beam, as determined from collocated in-\ncoherent scatter radar measurements of the modified iono-\nsphere. These propagation paths provide an opportunity to\nquantitatively test the available SuperDARN virtual height\nmodels as presented in Chisham et al. (2008) and highlight\nsignificant issues with the accuracy of the standard Super-\nDARN rangefinding algorithm. In addition, direct use of the\nmeasured elevation angle of arrival provides a new method of\ndetermining the backscatter location for 1 12 -hop paths with\nelevation angles in the range 10\u25e6\u201330\u25e6 for SuperDARN data\nrecorded at ranges 1500\u20132500 km, where reliable elevation\nangle data exist.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe data presented here result from the generation of HF co-\nherent backscatter from artificial ionospheric irregularities in\nthe fields-of-view of the SuperDARN radars at Hankasalmi\nAnn.

Details of SuperDARN are given in Greenwald\net al. (1995) and Chisham et al. (2007). Figure 1 presents\nthe beam and range locations for the 15 km range gate radar\nscan modes used in this study. For the SPEAR experiments,\na restricted scan ran on both channels of the radar, one us-\ning 45 km range gates, starting at a range of 180 km and the\nother 15 km range gates, starting at 1485 km. A frequency\nsweep mode was employed, ranging from 9.9\u201313.3 MHz, us-\ning integration times of 1 or 2 s per beam. Here data for\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r beam 6 and Hankasalmi beam 9, which intersect\nover SPEAR, are presented. Experiments performed with\nthe EISCAT Troms\u00f8 heating facility employed a similar scan\npattern, with data from 15 km range gates starting at a range\nof 1470 km for \u00deykkvib\u00e6r beam 15 and 15 km range gates\nstarting at a range of 480 km for Hankasalmi beam 5 pre-\nsented here, these beams intersecting over the Troms\u00f8 heater.\nIn Fig. 1 range gates are marked every 10th gate. For the EIS-\nCAT Troms\u00f8 experiments the heater operated at 50% power\n(using 6\u00d780 kW transmitters, an effective radiated power,\nERP, of \u223c130 MW), at a frequency of \u22484\u20135 MHz for 4-h in-\ntervals. For SPEAR experiments, the full SPEAR array was\nused (48\u00d72 kW transmitters), providing an ERP of\u223c15 MW,\nagain between 4\u20135 MHz. The heaters produce artificial elec-\ntron density irregularities in the F-region ionosphere (Robin-\nson, 1989), which act as targets for the HF radars (Robinson\net al., 1997; Yeoman et al., 1997b). The artificial targets re-\nsult in very high returned backscatter power in comparison\nto naturally-occurring irregularities. This allows a short in-\ntegration time to be run on the radar, providing higher time\nresolution than is normally available. Here backscatter power\nand elevation angle of arrival calculated from a cross correla-\ntion between signals detected on the main radar array and the\ninterferometer array are used. The accuracy of these eleva-\ntion angles has been verified through a detailed calibration of\nthe angles measured at a wide range of frequencies over a 12 -\nhop Hankasalmi-Troms\u00f8 path (see the experiment described\nin Senior et al., 2004), and through a comparison of the data\nrecorded with raytrace calculations through a model iono-\nsphere constrained by measurements taken from the EISCAT\ndynasonde, close to the midpoint of the Hankasalmi\u2013SPEAR\npropagation path. A schematic of 1 12 -hop HF radar propa-\ngation paths to the ionosphere above the heating facilities is\npresented in Fig. 2. Here a raytrace of ray paths for a typ-\nical ionosphere are shown in red, illustrating the refraction\nof the HF rays as a consequence of the increasing electron\ndensity as altitude increases in the ionosphere. The radar el-\nevation angle is the angle between these rays and the horizon\nat the radar site.

Figure 4 presents the results of such an anal-\nysis for column i) Hankasalmi-Troms\u00f8 in 1998; column ii)\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8 in 1998; column iii) \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8\nin 2004; column iv) Hankasalmi-SPEAR in 2005; and col-\numn v) \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-SPEAR in 2005. In this figure results\nare presented with the rangefinding algorithm used with a\nfixed pseudo-virtual height of 400 km (see Fig. 2), the stan-\ndard assumption used in SuperDARN analysis, in row a), for\nthe 12 -hop virtual height model of Chisham et al. (2008) in\nrow (b) and for the 1 12 -hop virtual height model of Chisham\net al. (2008) in row (cii\u2013cv). The ranges involved in Fig. 4\ncolumns ii to v occur within the 12 -hop to 1\n1\n2 -hop overlap\nregion identified in Chisham et al. (2008), hence, the loca-\ntion of the scattering region is estimated using both models.\nIn each panel backscatter occurrence is denoted on the left\nhand Y-axis labels. Also plotted is the actual location of the\nTroms\u00f8 and SPEAR field lines as a function of altitude, de-\nnoted on the right hand Y-axis label, taking into account the\norientation of the geomagnetic field. In each panel the centre\nof the occurrence histogram is marked by a vertical dashed\nline, the irregularity height is marked by a horizontal dashed\nline, and the offset between the centre of the data occurrence\nhistogram and the actual irregularity location on the SPEAR\nor Troms\u00f8 field line is highlighted with a horizontal red bar.\nThe data in Figs. 4i and 4ii were presented in Yeoman et\nal. (2001), although in that case the actual irregularity height\nof 210 km was used, and the range offset was expressed in\nterms of latitude and longitude. Figure 4ai illustrates that the\nstandard pseudo-virtual height assumption leads to a 45 km\nunderestimate (expressed to an accuracy of the nearest 15 km\nrange gate) of the backscatter range for the Hankasalmi-\nTroms\u00f8 12 -hop propagation path, which has an elevation an-\ngle of 10\u25e6 and a range of 825 km. As concluded in Yeoman\net al. (2001), such propagation paths give an accurate ground\nrange if the actual irregularity height is used. The 12 -hop vir-\ntual height model of Chisham et al.

The green line indicates the location of the field line intersecting the SPEAR location,\nwhereas the red rays correspond to the elevation angles measured in panel (a).\noffers an improvement over the standard algorithm, reducing\nthe offset to just 15 km. Figure 4 row a) clearly shows that the\nstandard 400 km pseudo-virtual height assumption leads to\nan overestimate of backscatter range for all the longer (prob-\nably 1 12 -hop) propagation paths, as expected. Figure 4aii\npresents data from the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8 1 12 -hop (elevation\nangle 18\u25e6) and 2 12 -hop (elevation angle 31\u25e6) paths. Again\nYeoman et al. (2001) deduced that these paths produced a\nground range offset of 115 km and 390 km respectively over\na range of 1830 km if the actual irregularity heights were\nused. These offsets reduce to 75 km and 360 km, respec-\ntively, with a pseudo-virtual height assumption of 400 km\n(for clarity only the 75 km offset for the 1 12 -hop propagation\npath is marked on the figure). In Fig. 4bii the 12 -hop vir-\ntual height model of Chisham et al. (2008) reduces this off-\nset to 30 km, whereas in Fig. 4cii the 1 12 -hop virtual height\nmodel produces an offset of 75 km. In both cases the range is\nnow underestimated, rather than over-estimated. Figure 4aiii\npresents more recent data taken over the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8\n1 12 -hop path in December 2004. The range offset can be\nseen to have increased significantly from the 1998 data, to\nsome 150 km. In Fig. 4biii the 12 -hop virtual height model of\nChisham et al. (2008) reduces this offset to 60 km, whereas in\nFig. 4ciii the 1 12 -hop virtual height model produces an offset\nof just 15 km. Data from the 1 12 -hop Hankasalmi-SPEAR\npath (range 1890 km) and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-SPEAR path (range\n2007 km) during 2004 and 2005 are presented in Fig. 4iv\nand 4v, respectively. These show similar larger range offsets\nof 270 km and 195 km for the 400 km fixed pseudo-virtual\nheight calculation in Fig. 4aiv and 4av, respectively. In\nFig. 4biv and 4bv the 12 -hop virtual height model of Chisham\net al. (2008) reduces these offsets to 130 km and 60 km re-\nspectively, whereas in Fig. 4civ the 1 12 -hop virtual height\nmodel reduces the offset for the Hankasalmi-SPEAR path\nfurther to 105 km. For the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-SPEAR path the 12 -hop\nand 1 12 -hop virtual height model are essentially identical.\n3.2 Elevation angle effects on rangefinding accuracy\nFigure 5a presents data in the same format as Fig. 3, but here\nthe elevation angle of arrival of the backscatter is presented.\nThe elevation angles are seen to be consistent through the\nartificial backscatter patches, with elevation angles of 21\u25e6\u2013\n23\u25e6 typically being recorded. Figure 5b presents a raytrace\n(using code based on Jones and Stephenson, 1975) of the HF\npropagation path for the transmission displayed in Figs. 3 and\n5a with rays shown for elevation angles 10\u201324\u25e6 at 1\u25e6 inter-\nvals. The raytrace is based on a double Chapman layer fitted\nto an EISCAT Svalbard radar electron density profile, scaled\nby data from the SPEAR ionosonde. The green line indicates\nthe location of the field line intersecting the SPEAR location.\nThe red rays correspond to the elevation angles measured in\nFig. 5a. These rays, with elevation angles of 21\u25e6\u201322\u25e6 are ex-\ncellent candidates for being orthogonal to the magnetic field\nabove SPEAR. Orthogonality is predicted to be achieved at\nan altitude of 200 km, which is in good agreement with the\ninteraction height of the SPEAR beam as determined through\nAnn.

Yeoman et al.: Mapping ionospheric backscatter measured by SuperDARN 849\nincoherent scatter measurements from the EISCAT Svalbard\nradar. Ground scatter is observed in Figs. 3 and 5a centred\nat range gate 28 (ranges of \u223c1300 km), and this again is in\ngood agreement with the raytrace; rays above 24\u25e6 are ex-\npected to penetrate the ionosphere. In fact the ground and\nnatural ionospheric backscatter observed at higher frequen-\ncies (13.3 MHz, not shown) are also in good agreement with\nraytracing through this model ionosphere.\nAs we now, for the first time, have a propagation path from\nHankasalmi to both Troms\u00f8 on a 12 -hop path and SPEAR on\na 1 12 -hop path, it is possible to use the Troms\u00f8 heater as an\naccurate calibration point for the Hankasalmi elevation angle\nof arrival data, and then accurately establish the propagation\npath for 1 12 -hop backscatter generated at SPEAR. This sheds\nlight on the evaluation of the virtual height models presented\nin Sect. 3.1, and offers an alternative strategy for rangefind-\ning corrections when reliable elevation angle data are avail-\nable from SuperDARN. In Fig. 6a, the Hankasalmi range\ngates which record backscatter at powers greater than 10 dB\ninduced by the SPEAR system during all available SPEAR\nexperiments in 2004 and 2005, such as those illustrated in\nFig. 3 are plotted against the corresponding elevation angle\nof arrival from the main array-interferometer array cross cor-\nrelation such as those illustrated in Fig. 5a, where it is avail-\nable. The angle of arrival data are binned into 1\u25e6 bins, and\noccurrence is indicated by color contours.

The\ndotted black lines represent best fit lines to the occurrence\ndistribution at\u00b11 standard deviation. The black filled circles\nrepresent the equivalent ranges calculated from the range off-\nsets from the original study of the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8 1 12 -\nand 2 12 -hop paths studied in Yeoman et al. (2001). A clear\ntrend of increasing range gate with increasing elevation an-\ngle is observed, with the data from the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8\n1 12 -hop path lying within the range of the lower elevation\nangle data recorded in 2004\/05. The \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8 2 12 -\nhop path produces a somewhat more extreme range error, as\nmight be expected from such an unusual propagation path.\nThese elevation angles will be compared to those employed\nin the development of the virtual height models of Chisham\net al. (2008) in the next section.\n4 Discussion\nArtificial radar backscatter generated at a known ground\nrange has been used to evaluate the standard SuperDARN\nrangefinding algorithm, and the new virtual height models\npresented by Chisham et al. (2008). The previous analysis\nof Yeoman et al. (2001) suggested that for 12 -hop backscat-\nter, with typical elevation angles of\u223c10\u25e6, the range accuracy\nis within one 15 km range gate if the actual irregularity alti-\ntude is used in the rangefinding algorithm. This analysis of a\nsimple 12 -hop path was in accord with previous results, as de-\nElevation angle vs virtual height\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nVi\nrtu\nal \nhe\nigh\nt (\nkm\n) y = 551.4 + 13.9 x\nElevation angle vs takeoff angle\n15 20 25 30\nElevation angle (\u00b0)\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nTa\nke\noff\n an\ngle\n (\u00b0\n) y = 8.334 + 0.323 x\n(c)\n(b)\nFigure 6\nSPEAR range gate vs elevation angle\n15 20 25 30\nElevation angle (\u00b0)\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\nRa\nng\ne g\nate\ny = 33.74 + 0.494 x \n(a)\n1\n5\n9\n13\n17\n21\n25\n29\n33\n37\nOccurrence\nFig. 6.

The dotted lines represent \u00b11 standard deviation of\nthe occurrence distribution. (c) As for (b), but for assumed takeoff\nangle vs. measured elevation angle.\ntailed in Yeoman et al. (2001). The new virtual height model\nof Chisham et al. (2008) retains this good level of accuracy\nfor short 12 -hop propagation paths.\nLonger ranges are routinely accessed by SuperDARN\nradars via 1 12 -hop paths, where the HF rays reflect from the\nionosphere, and then scatter from the ground or sea surface,\nbefore reaching an ionospheric target, as depicted schemati-\ncally in Fig. 2. The first analysis of range accuracy over such\n1 12 -hop propagation paths was also presented by Yeoman et\nal. (2001), who investigated a path with an elevation angle of\n\u223c18\u25e6 at a ground range of \u223c1800 km, where the rangefind-\ning algorithm had an offset of four 15 km range gates for the\nstandard pseudo-virtual height assumption of 400 km. The\nanalysis of a number of 1 12 -hop propagation paths presented\nhere demonstrates that the accuracy of the rangefinding al-\ngorithms is rather variable, but that the new pseudo-virtual\nheight models of Chisham et al. (2008) consistently make a\nvery significant improvement to the accuracy of SuperDARN\nrangefinding. Averaged over the 4 propagation paths pre-\nsented in Fig. 4, the new virtual height models improve the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/843\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 843\u2013852, 2008\n850 T. K. Yeoman et al.: Mapping ionospheric backscatter measured by SuperDARN\nerror in the rangefinding from 165 km when using the stan-\ndard pseudo-virtual height assumption to just 60 km. For\n3 out of the 4 propagation paths the new 1 12 -hop propaga-\ntion path pseudo-virtual height model gives a better correc-\ntion than the 12 -hop propagation path pseudo-virtual height\nmodel. This is not surprising, given that the propagation\npaths used are most likely 1 12 -hop. The 2\n1\n2 -hop propaga-\ntion path presented in Fig. 4ii is again improved when the\nnew pseudo-virtual height model is employed, although the\nrangefinding accuracy is still poor. Such 2 12 -hop paths are\nrarely observed in practice, although they could be important\nin the lower latitude SuperDARN radars such as that recently\ndeployed at Wallops Island.\nSome of the discrepancies between the actual and pre-\ndicted ground ranges can be understood by considering the\nelevation angles of the observed backscatter, and the eleva-\ntion angle data used in formulating the new pseudo-virtual\nheight model. Ranges such as those for the Hankasalmi-\nTroms\u00f8 path are only available through 12 -hop propagation.\nThe new virtual height model of Chisham et al. (2008) pro-\nduces a slightly lower pseudo-virtual height than the conven-\ntional SuperDARN rangefinding algorithm at these ranges,\nand thus gives a small improvement in range accuracy over\nthe standard algorithm. The data from the Saskatoon radar,\nwhich were used in the development of the new virtual height\nmodels, showed elevation angles of\u223c18\u25e6 dominated at these\nranges (see Fig. 3 of Chisham et al., 2008). These eleva-\ntion angles compare with elevation angles measured at Han-\nkasalmi of 10\u25e6 for the heater-induced scatter (see Yeoman et\nal., 2001). This reflects the difference between the typical\naltitudes of natural and heater-induced ionospheric irregular-\nities. Using a pseudo-virtual height closer to the actual ir-\nregularity height offers a further improvement, but the range\naccuracy is satisfactory in either case. The longest propa-\ngation paths examined here, those to SPEAR, give essen-\ntially the same range result for the 12 -hop and 1\n1\n2 -hop mod-\nels. Typical 1 12 -hop elevation angles to these ranges as used\nby Chisham et al. (2008) are \u223c22\u25e6, in close agreement with\nthose measured for the heater-induced scatter as presented in\nFig. 5. Figure 6a has demonstrated that, for a given prop-\nagation path, the range gate of the observed data increases\nsystematically with the elevation angle of the backscatter,\nthus we expect higher elevation angle backscatter to require\na larger range correction, or a higher pseudo-virtual height.\nA significant improvement in range accuracy is produced by\nboth new virtual height models for these paths, although both\nstill produce a consistent offset, placing the backscatter far-\nther from the radar than its actual location, implying that the\nactual propagation paths often have elevation angles in ex-\ncess of those used in developing the models of Chisham et\nal. (2008). The \u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8 path (a 1830 km, 1 12 -hop\npath) produces significant differences in range between the\n1\n2 -hop and 1\n1\n2 -hop models. Older data on this path from 1998(Fig. 4ii) had measured elevation angles of 18\u25e6, whereas\nthe Saskatoon data which were used in the development of\nthe new virtual height models showed elevation angles of\n14\u25e6 dominated at these ranges, on a 12 -hop propagation path\n(see Fig. 3 of Chisham et al., 2008). No significant 1 12 -hop\npropagation paths were observed for these ranges at Saska-\ntoon. The relatively low altitude of the heater-induced scat-\nter makes a 1 12 -hop path preferential for artificial scatter at\nthese ranges, whereas the natural scatter from Saskatoon in\nChisham et al. (2008) is from a 12 -hop path. The 1 12 -hop vir-\ntual height model of Chisham et al. (2008) was extrapolated\ninto these ranges, and would represent high elevation angle\nscatter. This leads to the new 1 12 -hop virtual height model\nunderestimating the ground range of this 18\u25e6 elevation angle\nscatter, whereas the 12 -hop model is accurate to 30 km. The\nmore recent data (from 2004, Fig. 4iii) have a larger range\noffset, resulting from higher elevation angles, and for these\ndata the 1 12 -hop virtual height model gives the more accurate\nground ranges.\nThe difference in range accuracy between the recent data\nfrom the two 1 12 -hop propagation paths to SPEAR, (270 and\n195 km in Figs. 4aiv and 4av) compared to the older re-\nsults from Yeoman et al. (2001) (75 km in Fig. 4aii) deserves\nsome further comment. The 75 km offset was reported to be\nvery consistent in the data presented in Yeoman et al. (2001)\nwho concluded that the determination of the location of the\nbackscatter was only weakly controlled by variations in the\nionosphere between the radar and target ionosphere during\nthe era when the original experiments were performed. Some\nof the differences between the Yeoman et al. (2001) data and\nthe new data presented here can most likely be attributed to\npath geometry, but the increase in range error between the\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r-Troms\u00f8 path in 1998 (Fig. 4ii) and the same path\nrecorded in 2004 (Fig. 4iii) suggests that the solar cycle is\nplaying a role, as the radar operating frequency was similar\nin all cases. For the 1998 data the 3 month averaged sunspot\nnumber was 75 (63% of the cycle 23 maximum) whereas it\nwas 30 in 2005 (25% of the cycle 23 maximum). Solar cycle\nand season will have a strong effect on the overlying F region\ncritical frequency (foF2) of the ionosphere through which the\nSuperDARN HF rays propagate. A ray of the same eleva-\ntion angle and frequency will refract at a higher altitude (and\nhence a farther range) when foF2 is lower, which in general\nwill be at solar minimum compared to solar maximum. Solar\nminimum conditions might also be expected to increase the\nlikelihood of the rays penetrating the ionosphere, thus pre-\nventing the measurement of artificial backscatter, although\nthe success rate of such experiments does not appear to be\nsignificantly solar cycle dependent. To allow for a propaga-\ntion path to the same location the elevation angle must in-\ncrease at times of reduced foF2. It thus seems likely that the\nlevel of solar activity plays a role in determining the viable\n1 12 -hop propagation path characteristics. Figure 6a suggests\nthat the likely radar elevation angles for 1 12 -hop backscatter\nhave significantly increased as solar activity has decreased.\nAnn.

Yeoman et al.: Mapping ionospheric backscatter measured by SuperDARN 851\nThe data presented in Fig. 6a allow for a direct transla-\ntion between the appropriate pseudo-virtual height input to\nthe SuperDARN rangefinding algorithm and the elevation\nangle measured by the radar, as the rangefinding algorithm\nyields a range gate for each assumed pseudo-virtual height\nfor a fixed ground range location. Such a plot is presented\nin Fig. 6b, which presents assumed pseudo-virtual height\nagainst elevation angle, such that the rangefinding algorithm\nplaces the appropriate range gate at the correct ground range.\nThe solid line uses the best fit line from Fig. 6a in this cal-\nculation, whereas the dashed lines use the corresponding \u00b11\nstandard deviation lines. The equation of the solid line is\ngiven in the upper left corner of the graph. An alternative\napproach to providing a pseudo-virtual height to the Super-\nDARN rangefinding algorithm is to provide an assumed take-\noff angle for the ray, based on straight-line propagation to\nthe pseudo-virtual height (see Fig. 2). This can similarly be\ncombined with the range gate vs. elevation angle data from\nthe Hankasalmi-SPEAR path to provide a correction factor\nwhich places the data at the correct ground range, and such a\nplot is presented in Fig. 6c, in the same format as Fig. 6b.\n5 Summary\nArtificial coherent HF radar backscatter generated by iono-\nspheric heating facilities have provided a high power signa-\nture at a known ground range which has been used to eval-\nuate the standard rangefinding algorithm of the SuperDARN\nradar facilities, and the new virtual height models presented\nby Chisham et al. (2008). The results have highlighted sig-\nnificant issues with the accuracy of the standard SuperDARN\nrangefinding algorithm. These issues may be largely miti-\ngated through the use of the new virtual height models which\nallow backscatter location to an average accuracy of \u00b160 km\nfor 1 12 -hop paths. In addition, direct use of the measured el-\nevation angle of arrival provides a new method of determin-\ning the backscatter location to an accuracy of \u00b145 km for\n1 12 -hop paths with elevation angles in the range 10\n\u25e6\n\u201330\u25e6 for\nSuperDARN data recorded at ranges 1500\u20132500 km, where\nreliable elevation angle data exist.\nAcknowledgements.
