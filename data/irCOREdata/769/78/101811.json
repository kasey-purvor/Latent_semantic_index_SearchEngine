Introduction\nThere has been rapid acceleration recently in the\nresearch and development of organic field-effect\ntransistors (OFETs) as key components for displays,\nradio frequency identification tags, and some other\nsmall-scale integrated circuits owing to their low cost\nand flexible properties [1, 2]. However, the main\nlimitation to extensive exploitation of OFETs comes\nfrom their low mobility which is, at best, two or three\norders of magnitude lower than that of standard\nsemiconductors. Carrier transport in organic\nsemiconductors depends on hopping or tunnelling\nbetween localized states [3]. Since carriers spend a\nsignificant amount of time trapped in states, the\neffective mobility is low and as a result the transistor\nspeed is reduced, leading to a severe limitation of\nanalog and high frequency performance. A\nconsiderable amount of basic research in the past is\naimed at improving the quality of organic material,\nparticularly by reducing the amount of disorder to\nreduce trap depths and improve mobility [4]. An\nalternative approach to improve transistor speed is to\ndesign structures with high internal electrical fields,\nbecause firstly, for a given mobility, carrier velocity\nis proportional to electric field and secondly in many\norganic semiconductors the mobility itself is field\ndependent [3, 5]. In material systems with disorder,\nthe electric field required to produce significant\nmobility changes is high, being 105 V\/cm at room\ntemperature [3]. This requires the design of short\nchannel OFETs. However, in this case, achieving thin\ngate insulator layers of high quality to suppress the\nshort-channel effects will be difficult. Here, the\nproposed source-gated transistor (SGT) can be\ndesigned to operate with much higher internal\nelectrical fields than the conventional FET, and\nbrings the possibility of designing high performance\ncircuits in low-mobility organic material for analog\nand high frequency applications.\nSource barrier\nT ti Drain\n_ (P~~W_ 4 L h1~~~+\na' X 1 1r; Pil\nSiN\n- -1Gate\nGlass\nFig. 1 Schematic drawing of a SGT structure in\namorphous silicon (a-Si:H) [6].\n2. Operation of Source-Gated Transistor\nThe SGT concept was first introduced in [6] for\namorphous silicon transistors. As shown in Fig. 1, in\nthe SGT, the source is a potential barrier to current\ntransport and the drain is assumed to be ohmic. The\ngate lies under the source barrier and extends under\nthe source-drain separation d to the drain contact.\nAlthough a doped layer is used to make a drain\nohmic contact, it is not essential. When the transistor\nis switched on, the current in the SGT is determined\nby the carrier emission over the source-barrier\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Most of the SGT current flows at the\nperiphery of the source barrier opposite to the drain\n[8]. Details of the operation of the SGT have been\ndescribed previously [6-9].\nA major difference between the SGT and a FET\nis that a reverse-biased source barrier controls the\ncurrent in the ON-state and current saturation is\ndetermined by the electrostatics at the source barrier\nrather than pinch-off at the drain end of a channel. In\naddition, the geometry of the SGT leads to a much\nsmaller susceptibility to short-channel effects and a\nhigher output impedance because the source barrier is\nscreened from the drain field by the gate [9]. What is\ninteresting in the context of our requirements for\nhigh-performance transistors in low mobility organic\nsemiconductors is that there are high fields sweeping\nthe carriers away toward the drain. Furthermore,\nthese transistors operate very well with small\ndimensions.\n3. Simulation Method\nTo compare the performance of SGT and FET in\norganic semiconductors, the OSGT and OFET\nstructures, as shown in Fig. 2, were simulated using\nthe two-dimensional Atlas device simulator vended\nby Silvaco [10]. The usual values of pentacene\n(energy gap of 2.5 eV, ionization potential of 5eV\nand dielectric constant of 4.0) have been used for the\norganic semiconductors in both structures [11]. The\nfield-dependent mobility of holes is described by the\nPoole-Frenkel model [3, 5], as:\nof 0.45 eV height for hole transport. The drain is\nassumed to be ohmic contact. And in the OFET, both\ncontacts are ohmic. A 15 nm thick channel, and an 80\nnm thick gate insulator (SiO2) are used in both\nstructures. The channel width is 1 ptm. The source\nlength is fixed as 0.5 ptm. For the OSGT, the change\nof effective source barrier height was assumed to be\nproportional to the electric field [13].\n4. Results and Discussion\n4.1. Susceptibility to short-channel effects\nHigh output impedance, high drive current and\nhigh speed are important for transistors in analog and\nhigh-frequency applications. For OFETs, a short-\nchannel for high internal field is preferred for\nachieving high drive current and high speed, but\nposes difficulties in suppressing short-channel effects\nthat degrade the output impedance. In the SGT, since\nthe saturation current is determined by the\nelectrostatics at the source barrier, and the source\nbarrier is screened from the drain field by the gate,\nthe susceptibility to short-channel effects is much\nweaker. This feature of the SGT enables it to operate\nwith very short source-drain separations even at a\nthick gate insulator layer.\n2.5x\n2.Ox\n1.5x\n1 .0)(1)\n5.Oxl\nwhere jio is the low field mobility, and Eo is a\ncharacteristics parameter equal to 3X 105 V\/cm.

This\nindicates a major advantage of SGT for high-speed\norganic electronics, since in terms of fabrication\nprocesses, it is still a big hurdle to produce the ultra-\nthin, high quality gate insulator layer needed for\nshort-channel FETs, while short-channel SGTs can\nwork well with a thicker insulator layer.\nFig. 4 The simulated drain saturation current (ISAT) in\nan OSGT and an OFET as a function of the low field\nmobility p'o, showing a much reduced dependence of\ndrive current in an OSGT compared with an OFET.\nThe gate bias for both structures is 4 V.\n19 -\n108\nN 10 -\nI\n- 1 05 ->% 6o.\n104\n1-\n10\no3_\n10-3 10-2 1o-0 10\u00b0 101\n,UO (cm2\/V.s)\nFig. 5 The simulated cut-off frequency (1T) and\nmaximum oscillation frequency (JMAX) in an OSGT\nand an OFET, showing the much reduced\ndependence on uo of the OSGT.

Drive current and frequency response\nAs discussed in [14], the way to obtain high drive\ncurrent and a good frequency response for a given\ngeometry transistor despite having a low carrier\nmobility is to operate with high internal fields over\nshort distances to reduce carrier transit times\ncombined with low carrier concentrations for low\ncapacitance.

Because both the carrier velocity and\ncharge mobility are field-dependent in the organic\nmaterial, much higher internal electric field in OSGT\nbrings higher drive current than that in the OFET\nwhen the low field mobility is small, as shown in Fig.\n4. With a i'o Of 0.001 cm2\/ V.s, the OSGT can\nachieve a drive current 100 times that of an OFET at\na gate bias of 4 V. When po is large, the saturation\ncurrent in the OSGT is limited by hole emission over\nthe source barrier, and thus becomes lower than an\nequivalent OFET.\nThe frequency response of OSGT and OFET\nwere also simulated using the Atlas device simulator.\nSimilarly, much higher cut-off frequency (1T) and\nmaximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) are achieved\nby the SGT structure in low po material. With a Po of\n0.001 cm2\/ V.s, the OSGT has afT about 0.4 MHz,\nwhich is more than 100 times of the value for the\nOFET. To obtain a higher fT, we can operate the\nOSGT with a higher gate bias, and can also reduce\nthe barrier height at the source contact. We found,\nreducing the OSGT source barrier height by 65 meV,\nfor example, would increase fT by approximately an\norder of magnitude. Thus, the OSGT may enable\ntransistors in very low mobility organics for high\nfrequency applications. Although with higher m, the\nFET can achieve a higher fT due to higher drive\ncurrent, the fmAx of the OFET is still lower than that\nof the OSGT, which is because the OSGT has much\nbetter output saturation characteristics.\n2.5x\n2.0x\n1 .5x\nCOx\n5.Oxl\nlio- d=1 gm ~~~~~~VGS:d=tm5 V\n,lo-9 4V\n,lo ,9- X23V\nlo10-0 2V\n1 v\n0.0 X -- IV\n0 -1 -2 -3\nVDS (V)\n(a)\n-4 -5\n3.0x109-\n2.0x109-\n1.Ox10-9 -\n0.2 0.4 0.6\nd (1m)\n(b)\n0.8 1.0\nFig. 6 (a) The output characteristics (IDs-VDS) of\nOSGT with d =1 pm, and\n'o\n= 0.001 cm2\/ V.s; (b)\nISAT and the drain saturation voltage (VSAT) as a\nfunction of d with po = 0.001 cm2\/ V.s.\nThe results in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the drive\ncurrent and speed of OSGT are much less sensitive to\nthe low-field the mobility of the channel material\nthan that of the OFET, thus making the SGT a more\nsuitable candidate for achieving high performance\ntransistors in low mobility organic semiconductors.\n4.3. Source-drain separation on OSGT\nperformance\nHigh-speed performance of the OSGT needs\nsmall source-drain separation. Through simulating\nOSGTs with different values of d, we found that the\ndrive current is insensitive to the source-drain\nseparation (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6 (a), for an\nOSGT with d = 1 m, the current levels in the\nsaturation regime at different VGS are quite close to\nthat of an OSGT with d = 0.25 ptm shown in Fig. 3\n(a). As mentioned above, this is because, in the SGT,\nthe saturation current is determined by the carrier\nemission over the source-barrier contact, while the\nbarrier is mainly controlled along the vertical\ndirection. However, as d increases, the drain voltage\nthat is required to deplete the channel is increased, so\nthe absolute value of saturation voltage (VSAT)\nincreases approximately linearly with d as shown in\nFig. 6(b). The results are important because if the\ncurrent is insensitive to source-drain separation, the\ntechnology used does not need to provide precisely\ndefined gaps between the source and drain regions.\nFor example, fabrication of submicron source-drain\nseparations can be achieved using self-aligned spacer\ntechnology, since the separations are similar to\nstandard layer thicknesses. And the exact control of\nthese thicknesses is not necessary for making OSGTs\n- -0.6\n- -0.8\n-\n-1.0 >I\n- -1.2\n- -1.4\nVLSVa\nVGS=4VX\nv .

Similarly, an imprecise\ndewetting technology [15] is also much better suited\nto an OSGT than an OFET.\n5. Conclusions\nCompared to a FET, the ON-state current in the\nSGT is controlled by source barrier and current\nsaturation is determined by the electrostatics at the\nsource barrier rather than pinch-off at the drain end of\na channel. This feature enables SGTs to operate with\nvery short source-drain separations even with a thick\ngate insulator layer, thus providing a big advantage in\nterms of the fabrication process. The SGT structure\ncan also be operated with much higher internal\nelectric fields to increase the carrier velocity in\norganic materials for high drive current and\nfrequency response that can be orders of magnitude\nhigher than an OFET. It is shown that the current\nthrough an OSGT is insensitive to source-drain\nseparation thus enabling current uniformity to be\nobtained with simple and imprecise technology. It is\nconcluded that, the SGT is an excellent candidate for\nbuilding high performance organic electronics for\nanalog and high frequency applications.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank EPSRC, UK for\nfunding this project.
