The preservation of this K-rich melt27\ncomponent in the andesite suggests short timescales between mixing and ascent.28\nDiffusive timescales are consistent with independent petrological estimates of magma29\nascent time.30\n31\nINTRODUCTION32\nMany arc volcanoes are dominated by interaction between mafic and silicic magmas.33\nRecharge by hotter, more mafic material is frequently cited as an eruption trigger, and34\n2transfer of volatiles may be important in both promoting mixing (e.g. Eichelberger,35\n1980) and advecting heat into, and remobilising, the overlying crystal-rich silicic36\nmagma (Bachmann and Bergantz, 2006). Magma mingling (incomplete mixing)37\nproduces quenched magmatic enclaves, crystal clusters and other clear disequilibrium38\ntextures (Anderson, 1976; Bacon, 1986; Clynne, 1999). Recognising the products of39\nmagma hybridisation (complete mixing) is important for understanding the relative40\nproportions and compositions of the end-member magmas, the likely impact of41\nrepeated recharge, and the processes causing mass transfer between magmas.42\n43\nRecent studies have shown that microlites of anomalously An-rich plagioclase (as44\nwell as clinopyroxene and Mg-rich orthopyroxene) in intermediate arc magmas45\noriginate in mafic magmatic enclaves or \u2018mafic inclusions\u2019 (Martel et al., 2006;46\nHumphreys et al., 2009a). The microlites are transferred into the andesite either47\nduring mixing in the chamber (Martel et al. 2006) or by physical break-up and48\ndisaggregation of mafic inclusions by shearing during ascent (Humphreys et al.,49\n2009a). This physical transfer of crystals will increase magma viscosity in the conduit50\nand therefore has implications for eruption dynamics, as well as the potential to be51\nused as a tracer of the mafic component. With effective mixing, one might also expect52\nto see a mafic melt component. Melt inclusions and matrix glasses are commonly53\nused to track magma evolution paths and assess magma storage conditions (e.g.54\nSisson and Layne, 1993;Wallace et al., 1995; Blundy et al., 2006), so it is vital to55\ndetermine whether melt derived from the mafic magma is entering the andesite, and if56\nso, in what proportions and with what chemical signature. Quantifying the extent and57\ntimescale of interaction between andesitic and mafic magma, which is thought to58\ndrive the eruption, would also be invaluable for volcano monitoring and hazard59\nassessment. Here we examine evidence that magma mingling does involve transfer of60\nmafic-derived melt, preserved as heterogeneity in plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions61\nand matrix glasses.62\n63\nGEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND AND SAMPLES STUDIED64\nThe Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano on Montserrat lies in the Lesser Antilles subduction zone65\nand has been active for approximately ~300 ka (Harford et al., 2002). The most66\nrecent eruption started in 1995, with a series of pulses of dome growth and explosive67\nactivity, interrupted by long pauses when no magma was erupted. Major dome68\n3collapses occurred in December 1997, July 1999, July 2001, July 2003 and May 2006.69\nCurrently (September 2009) activity is limited to low-level residual activity, although70\nwith continuing significant gas emissions (www.mvo.ms).71\n72\nProducts from the current eruption are porphyritic andesite, with phenocrysts of73\nhornblende, plagioclase, orthopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides plus rhyolite glass or74\ngroundmass. Disequilibrium crystal textures are common, including rare, resorbed75\nquartz phenocrysts, oscillatory zoning in plagioclase and hornblende, reversely zoned76\northopyroxene and sieve-textured plagioclase (Murphy et al., 2000). The groundmass77\ncontains microlites of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides as78\nwell as rhyolitic glass, and may show extensive crystallisation, incipient79\ndevitrification and deposits of cristobalite. Macroscopic mafic inclusions have been80\ndescribed in detail (Murphy et al., 1998; 2000) and contain plagioclase,81\nclinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and rhyolitic interstitial glass; larger82\ninclusions also crystallise pargasitic amphibole (Murphy et al., 1998). Many of the83\nmicrolites in the andesite are derived from mafic inclusions, as are crystal clusters, i.e.84\nmafic-derived fragments that can be recognised by texture and mineral compositions85\n(Humphreys et al., 2009a).86\n87\nRESULTS88\nWe analysed plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions, matrix glass and residual mafic89\ninclusion glass from 23 samples erupted between July 2001 and July 2008 (see90\nsupplementary table 1). Most of the samples represent typical andesite. Sample91\nMVO1532d is a heterogeneous mixture of nearly microlite-free rhyolite glass92\ncontaining euhedral quartz, plagioclase and hornblende, with fine-grained, crystal-rich93\npatches with very little remaining glass. Sample preparation and analytical methods,94\ntogether with the procedure used to correct for post-entrapment crystallisation (PEC)95\nof melt inclusions, are described in the auxiliary material.96\n97\nMelt inclusions98\nMelt inclusions are rhyolitic, with 71-79 wt% SiO2 (see supplementary data table 2;99\nfigures show PEC-corrected values, normalised to 100% anhydrous). Compositions100\nare similar to those reported by Edmonds et al. (2001), Harford et al. (2003) and101\nBuckley et al. (2006). Two populations can be distinguished on the basis of K2O102\n4contents (figure 1). Most inclusions have 2\u20133 wt% K2O, increasing with SiO2 and Cl103\ncontents, but a minority of inclusions has up to 6 wt% K2O. For the low-K population,104\nAl2O3, CaO and Na2O show a scattered negative relationship with SiO2. FeO, MgO105\nand TiO2 subtly increase with SiO2, and also correlate with each other (e.g. figure 1d).106\nThe high-K inclusion population has lower CaO than the low-K glasses, and slightly107\nlower Cl (figure 1). Two inclusions have high TiO2 but low K2O (figure 2). High-K108\nglasses were not present in pumiceous samples.109\n110\nMatrix glasses111\nMatrix glass was analysed in samples without significant groundmass crystallisation112\n(supplementary table 1). Matrix glasses are rhyolitic, clustering at the SiO2-rich end of113\nthe melt inclusion trends (75-79 wt% SiO2, figure 1). There are four groups of matrix114\nglasses: (i) high-K, low-Ti, (ii) low-K, low-Ti, (iii) high-K, high-Ti, and (iii) low-K,115\nhigh-Ti compositions (figure 2). High-K matrix glasses extend to lower CaO contents116\nthan low-K glasses (figure 1b). Some glasses have anomalously low MgO. High-K117\nglasses were not present in the pumice samples.118\n119\nMafic inclusion glass120\nResidual mafic inclusion glasses are also rhyolitic (72-78 wt% SiO2). In Si, Al, Fe and121\nNa composition they are indistinguishable from the melt inclusions. However, they122\nhave distinctive high-Ti, high-K compositions (figure 2) and also show low CaO123\ncontents, similar to the other high-K glasses. Many of the residual glasses also have124\nlow MgO contents. Cl concentrations are variable but tend to be lower than in the125\nmelt inclusions (figure 1).126\n127\nDISCUSSION128\nIn general, the negative correlations of Al2O3, CaO and Na2O with SiO2 in the melt129\ninclusions indicate decompression crystallisation dominated by plagioclase (e.g.130\nBuckley et al., 2006). The positive correlation between FeO and MgO, and slight131\nincrease of both MgO and FeO with SiO2 suggests minor crystallisation of132\northopyroxene or hornblende as observed in the andesite. Ti-Fe variations are133\nconsistent with crystallisation of minor Ti-magnetite. The low-K matrix glasses134\nfollow mainly the same compositional trends as the low-K melt inclusions but tend135\ntowards higher K2O and higher SiO2, as K is enriched in the melt during groundmass136\n5crystallisation (Harford et al., 2003). Low-K matrix glasses show decreasing MgO137\nwith increasing SiO2, consistent with groundmass crystallisation of orthopyroxene.138\nThe trend of decreasing Cl with increasing K2O in the matrix glass (figure 1f)139\nindicates degassing of Cl during decompression crystallisation (Edmonds et al., 2001;140\nHarford et al., 2003; Humphreys et al., 2009b).141\nThe low-Ca, low-Mg compositions of the mafic inclusion residual glasses are142\nconsistent with significant crystallisation of clinopyroxene in the mafic inclusions.143\nThe very high K2O contents of mafic inclusion glasses are consistent with the lower144\nproportions of amphibole in the mafic inclusions and their lower bulk SiO2 contents145\nrelative to the andesite; their high TiO2 may be related to the high TiO2 of the bulk146\nmafic inclusions.147\n148\nOrigin of high-K glass149\nWhile the main compositional characteristics of the glass suite are consistent with150\nnear-surface processes (see above), the K-rich signature of some glasses is not. The151\noccasional high TiO2, high-K2O, low MgO and low CaO contents are also seen in152\npreviously reported matrix glasses (Edmonds et al., 2001; 2002; Harford et al., 2003;153\nBuckley et al., 2006; see figure 1). These compositional features are largely shared by154\nthe residual mafic inclusion glasses.155\nThe anomalous glass compositions cannot be caused by boundary layer effects156\nduring melt inclusion entrapment (Baker, 2008) because only slowly diffusing157\nincompatible elements should be enriched in the melt boundary layer, whereas K\n+158\ndiffusivities are rapid (Jambon, 1983). Similarly, post-entrapment crystallisation of159\nhost plagioclase should result in coupled increases of MgO, TiO2 and K2O with160\ndecreasing CaO, which are not observed, and cannot account for anomalous matrix161\nglass compositions.162\nK-rich glasses or crystalline products have been ascribed to grain-boundary163\npartial melting of mafic cumulate nodules (Dungan and Davidson, 2004; Heliker,164\n1995) or assimilation of biotite-rich cumulates (Reubi and Blundy, 2008), with K-rich165\nand host melts mixing during subsequent nodule break-up. However, cumulate166\nnodules are relatively rare in Soufri\u00e8re Hills andesite and were not observed in any of167\nthe samples studied, while the high-K glasses are texturally indistinguishable from168\n\u2018normal\u2019 glasses and their host crystals are not obviously xenocrystic. Finally, K-rich169\n6glasses are also found in mafic inclusions, which are widely agreed to form by rapid170\nquenching against a cooler host (e.g. Wager and Bailey 1953; Yoder 1973).171\nBuckley et al. (2006) ascribed the high-K compositions to hornblende172\nbreakdown during slow magma ascent and mixing between more- and less-evolved173\nmelts. Mass balance between the dissolving hornblende and the observed rims (cpx +174\nopx + plag + oxides) indicated that melts modified by hornblende breakdown should175\nthus be compositionally variable, with high TiO2 and MgO but low SiO2 and FeO.176\nThe melts should all have high K2O, Na2O and Cl (Buckley et al., 2006). Neither of177\ntheir predicted trends fits with all the observed compositional variations (figure 1).178\nInterstitial melts in hornblende breakdown rims (Buckley et al., 2006) actually show179\nboth high-K and low-K compositions (figure 1a), not just high-K compositions as180\nexpected. We therefore conclude that decompression breakdown of hornblende cannot181\nadequately describe the high-K glasses.182\n183\nMagma hybridisation and diffusive contamination184\nWe propose that the K-rich melts are derived from, or affected by mixing with185\nintruding mafic magma. The K-rich compositions are similar to those of mafic186\ninclusion residual glass, and incorporation of K-rich melt into the host matrix is187\nconsistent with transfer of microlites into the andesite groundmass by disaggregation188\nof mafic inclusions (Humphreys et al., 2009a). However, K2O-TiO2 concentrations189\ndemonstrate the presence of four distinct glass compositions (see earlier; figure 2): (i)190\nlow-K, low-Ti; (ii) low-K, high-Ti; (iii) high-K, high-Ti; and (iv) high-K, low-Ti.191\nThis indicates that the mafic inclusion glasses are, for the most part, not being192\ntransferred unmodified into the host andesite, and suggests diffusive modification.193\nBreaking open partially crystalline mafic inclusions would allow interaction between194\nhost (rhyolite) melt from the andesite and residual rhyolite from the interior of the195\nmafic inclusions. Similarly, complete disaggregation of mafic inclusions would result196\nin physical transfer of K-rich, Ti-rich residual rhyolite, which can be modified by197\ndiffusive re-equilibration with the host melt. Diffusion of TiO2 is much slower than198\nthat of K2O (see later), so residual mafic glass that has lost K2O by diffusion still199\nretains its high-Ti signature, whereas the high-K host rhyolite cannot gain TiO2 by200\ndiffusion (figure 2). The result is anomalously K-rich (but Ti-poor) host rhyolite melt,201\nand K-poor (but Ti-rich) residual mafic inclusion glasses. This process explains the202\nlack of ubiquitous Ti-enrichment of high-K melt inclusions and matrix glasses203\n7compared with mafic inclusion glass. Once a pocket of K-rich melt is present in the204\nmatrix of the andesite, it can be incorporated into melt inclusions by sealing of proto-205\ninclusions during ascent-driven crystallisation (see Humphreys et al., 2008, figure 11).206\n207\nTimescales of between mixing and eruption208\nThe glass compositions and distribution can give further insight into the physical209\nprocesses involved in transfer of material. For example, the lack of K-rich glasses in210\npumiceous samples (see earlier) implies that K-enrichment occurs during slow ascent.211\nMany of the K-rich compositions are matrix glass, with relatively few high-K melt212\ninclusions. This also suggests that transfer occurs primarily during low-pressure213\nascent and crystallisation, and could be explained by lower shear stresses in the214\nconduit during rapid ascent of less viscous, less crystalline magma (e.g. Melnik and215\nSparks 2005) compared with the highly viscous, strongly crystalline magma that216\nerupts slowly during dome growth.217\nElemental diffusivities can be used to assess the timescales of this process218\n(Sparks et al. 1977; Baker, 1991). Alkali and alkaline earth diffusivities (D) in219\nanhydrous rhyolite are DNa ~ 1.6 \u000210\n-6\ncm\n2\n\/s, DK ~ 8.9\u000210\n-8\ncm\n2\n\/s, and DCa ~ 4.0 \u000210\n-220\n10\ncm\n2\n\/s at 900 \u00b0C (Jambon 1983). A first-order approximation of timescales (t) can221\nbe made, ignoring the effects of possible differences in melt H2O content, from x ~222\n2\u0002(Dt), where x is the diffusion lengthscale, here taken to be 1 cm. Diffusive223\ntimescales are 43 hours (Na+), 32 days (K+) and 20 years (Ca2+). In other words,224\nalkaline earth diffusion is slow relative to alkalis; diffusion of highly charged ions225\n(e.g. Ti4+) should be even slower than the alkaline earths (Henderson et al. 1985).226\nDiffusive contamination of alkalis should therefore be rapid, but modification of other227\nelements would be prohibitively slow (Baker, 1991). The K-enrichment of the228\nrhyolite matrix of the host andesite must therefore have occurred ~1 month or less229\nprior to eruption of the magma at the surface, in order to preserve the high-K230\nsignature. This is consistent with timescales estimated by preservation of Fe-Ti oxide231\nzoning (Devine et al. 2003) and decompression breakdown rims on hornblende232\n(Rutherford and Devine 2003). The few high-Ti, low-K glasses, and the wide range of233\nK2O contents of residual mafic inclusion glasses (figure 2) may reflect a spread to234\nlonger timescales, allowing complete or partial re-equilibration of K2O with the host235\nrhyolite. We also note that the K2O contents of mafic inclusion and high-K host melts236\n8are similar, whereas a diffusion couple should give slightly lower K2O contents in the237\nhost melt. There are two possible explanations for this: (i) the mafic inclusion glasses238\nare already diffused and their observed compositions are not primary, or (ii) the high239\nK2O in the host rhyolite represents an uphill diffusion \u2018spike\u2019 similar to that observed240\nin experimental diffusion couples (Bindeman and Davis 1999; van der Laan et al.241\n1994). In either case, this observation reinforces the short timescales between mixing242\nand eruption.243\nThe estimated diffusion timescales also suggest that Na2O contents would244\nquickly be homogenised by diffusion between host andesite and mafic inclusions,245\nwhile original CaO contents should be preserved. We would also anticipate rapid246\ndiffusion of volatiles (e.g. CO2 and H2O), particularly in more H2O-rich melt (Baker247\net al. 2005). It is difficult to assess the effects of mixing and diffusion on Ca and Na248\nas these elements are compatible in the crystallising assemblage and therefore249\nstrongly affected by fractionation of plagioclase, whereas K is strongly incompatible.250\nHowever, the K-enriched glasses are slightly depleted in CaO relative to the normal251\nglasses, as is the mafic inclusion residual glass. The different diffusivities of CaO and252\nK2O are not consistent with diffusive contamination of both elements: timescales long253\nenough for significant Ca diffusion would also eliminate any K2O signature. The254\nlower CaO contents cannot be produced by crystallisation of quartz, or diffusion255\ngradients around growing plagioclase or pyroxene grains, as discussed earlier. We256\nsuggest that the lower CaO might be related to continued crystallisation of257\nplagioclase.258\n259\nCONCLUSIONS260\nGlass compositional heterogeneity from Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, is261\ninterpreted as the result of mingling between hotter, mafic magma and the host262\nandesite. High-K2O melt inclusions and matrix glasses in the andesite overlap with263\nthe compositions of residual glass from mafic inclusions. However, K2O and TiO2264\ncontents are decoupled: many high-K melt inclusions do not show high Ti as seen in265\nresidual mafic inclusion glasses. This can be explained by diffusive exchange between266\ndisaggregated mafic inclusion melt and host matrix melt. The host rhyolite gains K2O267\nfrom mafic inclusions, but the original low TiO2 contents are unchanged. Conversely,268\nhigh-Ti glasses with normal K2O contents probably represent residual mafic inclusion269\nglass that has lost K2O by diffusion. The preservation of such heterogeneity can be270\n9used to estimate the timescales between mingling and magma ascent to the surface.271\nThe timescales necessary to preserve K heterogeneity are on the order of a month,272\nwhich is consistent with magma ascent times estimated from hornblende breakdown273\nand Fe-Ti oxides.274\n275\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS276\nMCSH acknowledges a Junior Research Fellowship from Trinity College, Cambridge.277\nME acknowledges the NERC National Centre for Earth Observation (Theme 6:278\nDynamic Earth) grant NE\/F001487\/1.
