Introduction \nPolymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based on \ncomposites of electron-donating conjugated polymers and electron-accepting fullerene \nderivatives have the potential for low-cost and flexible renewable energy sources.1,2,3 \nWhen conjugated polymers and fullerenes are blended together phase segregation can \noccur at nanometre length scales producing a bicontinuous interpenetrating network \nof the polymer and fullerene blend components.4 When light is incident on the devices, \nthe polymer serves as the light absorber and excitons are formed on the polymer \nchains.5 These excitons can dissociate if they diffuse to a polymer-fullerene interface \nwith a typical diffusion length of 10 nm.5 Efficient exciton dissociation and charge \ntransport can be accomplished with a polymer\/fullerene blend at different ratios, \nwhich provides the required high interfacial area between the polymer and the \nfullerene.2 The most commonly used OPV material combination which exploits the \nBHJ concept is poly (3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid \nmethyl ester (PCBM), which is now used as the model system and have achieved \nefficiencies  of about 5 % under solar illumination.6,7 \nCarbon nanotubes (CNT) are incorporated into OPVs by introducing them into the \nP3HT\/PCBM photoactive layer to utilise their exceptional charge transport properties \nand to provide good dissociation centres.8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Both single wall carbon \nnanotubes (SWCNT) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been \nextensively incorporated into photoactive materials.6,7,8,12,13 Some of the recent reports \ndemonstrated that the complexes of fullerene (C60) \u2013 SWCNT and C60 \u2013 MWCNT, \nwhere the functionalized nanotubes were decorated with the clusters of C60 molecules, \nprovided a direct path for electron transport.16,17,18 However, the power conversion \nefficiency was rather low. This may be due to inefficient electron transportation \nacross C60 layer.  \nTherefore, the appropriate introduction of nanotubes with significantly higher electron \nmobility is a promising route to enhance the OPV cell performance. One important \nissue to be considered is that the compatibility of different phases in the photoactive \ncomposite layer, particularly since the nanotubes tend to be insoluble in most of the \nsolvents used. The low solubility of nanotubes was a significant obstacle in obtaining  \nuniform blends of polymer\/fullerene\/nanotubes. It is also known that different types \nof functionalization process lead to good dispersibility in organic solvents.19,20,21 The \nobjective of this research is the functionalization of MWCNT in order to incorporate \n3 \n \nin OPV cells, which is attractive to produce low-cost energy devices. Many research \nreports described that the carboxylic acid functionalized MWCNT (O-MWCNT) \nresulted in improved thin film deposition compared with pristine MWCNT and that \nenhanced the power conversion efficiency of OPV cells. 22 , 23  Chemical \nfunctionalization can take place inducing the exfoliation of nanotubes bundles and \nthen improve their solubility and processability. The modification of the chemical and \nphysical properties of nanotubes via functionalization can provide a better interaction \nof the nanotubes and the polymer phase.24 The best results were obtained, so far, with \nP3HT\/PCBM using MWCNT was about 2 % of power conversion efficiency under \nAM1.5 illumination.15,27 \nWe report functionalization of MWCNT with thiophene and amine groups and their \nincorporation in P3HT\/PCBM OPV cells, resulting in improved performance \ncompared with nanotube incorporated solar cells. Thiophene functionalized MWCNT \n(T-MWCNT), amine functionalized (A-MWCNT) and thiophene\u2013amine bi-\nfunctionalized MWCNT (TA-MWCNT) were synthesized and incorporated into the \nP3HT\/PCBM photoactive layer.  These functional groups were chosen such that T-\nMWCNT will tend to form more percolation networks with P3HT and A-MWCNT \nwill have a tendency to form more networks with PCBM due to their chemical affinity \nduring solution blending, while TA-MWCNT may have the tendency to be \ncompatible with both P3HT and PCBM on a single CNT scaffold structure to shorten \nthe exciton dissociation pathway.  \n \n2. Experimental Details \n2.1 Functionalization of Nanotubes \nThe preparation method used to functionalize MWCNT is shown in Figure 1. The \nsynthetic methods used to produce the thiophene and amine functionalized nanotubes \nfollowed procedures described elsewhere.21, 25 , 26  MWCNT, thionyl chloride, 2-\nthiopheneethylamine, and ethylene diamine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. \nP3HT was obtained from Rieke Metals, USA and PCBM from Solenne (The \nNetherlands).  Carboxylic acid functionalized MWCNT (O-MWCNT) were prepared \nby refluxing the raw nanotubes using H2SO4:HNO3 in 3:1 ratio for 3 h at 130\u00b0C.27 The \nacid treated nanotubes were washed in de-ionized water and centrifuged at 8500 rpm \nfor 10 min. This solution was filtered through a PTFE membrane (0.2\u00b5m) and dried in \n4 \n \na vacuum oven. In the second step, carboxylic acid groups were activated through \nrefluxing with thionyl chloride with a catalytic quantity of N,N-dimethylformamide \nfor 24 h.21,25,26 The excess of thionyl chloride was removed by vapour distillation \nunder reduced pressure. The product was washed with dichloromethane and dried in a \nvacuum oven. In the final step, COCl-MWCNT were reacted with 2-\nthiopheneethylamine in order to obtain thiophene functionalized CNT (T-MWCNT)26 \nand with ethylene diamine to obtain amine functionalized CNT (A-MWCNT).21,25 T-\nMWCNT:COCl terminated MWCNT were dispersed in dichloromethane by \nultrasonication for about 10 min, then 2-thiopheneethylamine added to the CNT \nsuspension and refluxed for 48h under N2. After the reaction, excess components were \nremoved by vapour distillation and aqueous HCL solution added, with the final \nproduct isolated by centrifugation and subsequent washing with de-ionized water and \ndried under vacuum. A-MWCNT: COCl-MWCNT were dispersed in dichloromethane \nby sonication for 10 min, and ethylene diamine was added to the mixer, then refluxed \nfor 48 h at 80\u00b0C. After the reaction was completed, excess ethylene diamine was \nremoved by vapour distillation and rinsed\/washed with ethanol for five times. Finally, \nthe product was dried under vacuum. TA-MWCNT:COCl terminated MWCNT were \ndispersed in dichloromethane by ultrasonication for about 10 min, then 2-\nthiopheneethylamine and ethylene diamine added to the CNT suspension and refluxed \nfor 48h under N2. After the reaction, the excess components were removed by vapour \ndistillation and aqueous HCL solution was added and the final product isolated by \ncentrifugation and subsequent washing with de-ionized water and ethanol, with \nsubsequent drying under vacuum. These chemically functionalized MWCNT were \nanalysed by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. \n \nFigure 1. The synthetic strategy used for the functionalization of MWCNT.  \n5 \n \n \n2.2 Characterization Methods \nFTIR spectra were recorded on a Varian 660-IR FTIR Spectrometer with potassium \nbromide (KBr) pellets. Raman measurements were carried out using a Renishaw \nSystems 2000 Raman microscope with a polarized laser at 514 nm. \n \n2.3 Fabrication and Characterization of Photovoltaic Cells \nThe chemically functionalized MWCNTs have been incorporated in the blend of \nP3HT\/PCBM (1:1). In the photoactive layer for OPVs, 0.1 mg (0.3 w%) of modified \nMWCNTs were dispersed separately in 1 ml of DCB and sonicated for 1 h. 15 mg of \nP3HT was added to all solutions, stirred for 3 h and 15 mg of PCBM was added to the \nP3HT\/MWCNT mixture. These mixtures were stirred overnight and deposited on \nplasma oxidized ITO\/Glass substrates. The spin-coated thin films were allowed to dry \nfor about 40 min at room temperature and then annealed at 125\u00b0C for 10 min. This \nwhole process was carried out in a nitrogen filled glove box. The hole blocking layer \nbachocuproine (BCP) and the aluminium (Al) electrode were thermally evaporated \nusing a shadow mask under vacuum at the rate of 2 \u00c5\/s and 3 \u00c5\/s, respectively. The \nactive area of the devices was 76 mm2. Immediately after the device fabrication, \ncurrent-voltage measurements were collected using a Keithley 2425 source meter \nexposing the devices to a 300 W Xe Arc lamp ORIEL simulator, fitted with an Air \nMass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) filter, calibrated to an intensity of 1000 Wm-2. \n \n3. Results and Discussion \nFigure 2 illustrates the active layers of (a) P3HT:PCBM:T-MWCNT, (b) \nP3HT:PCBM:A-MWCNT investigated with electron microscopy. It can be observed \nthat the T-MWCNT incorporated active layers show better dispersion compared with \nthe A-MWCNT incorporated layers. With TA-MWCNTs a random distribution of \nlocalities depicting T-MWCNT and A-MWCNT distribution can be observed (not \nshown).  \n6 \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

Raman spectra of raw (R-MWCNT) and functionalized MWCNT. \n \nFigure 3 shows the Raman spectra of chemically modified MWCNTs with various \nfunctional groups. The influence of chemical modification is observed by the relative \nchanges in the characteristic peaks of MWCNT tangential modes, the D band (1345 \ncm-1) and G band (1575 cm-1) in the presence of various functional groups.21,25,26 The \nD band is activated in the first order scattering process of sp2 carbons by the presence \nof in-plane substitutional hetero-atoms, vacancies, grain boundary or other defects.12 \nThe relative changes in the D\/G band ratios of functionalized nanotubes has been \n7 \n \nextensively utilized as an indication of the covalent sidewall functionalization. It \nreflects the conversion of the hybridization of some carbon atoms from sp2 to sp3.28 \nThe significant decrease in the D\/G ratio of acid treated nanotubes (O-MWCNT) \ncompared to that of pristine nanotubes could indicate the removal of amorphous \ncarbon impurities by the acid treatment. The increase in D\/G ratio for thiophene, \namine, and thiophene-amine functionalized MWCNT relative to O-MWCNT is \nattributed to the introduction of different functional groups at various sidewall defects.  \nFigure 4 shows the FTIR spectra of raw MWCNT and functionalized MWCNT. The \nspectrum of acid terminated MWCNT (O-MWCNT) show peaks at about 1470 and \n1200 cm-1, which can be assigned to C=O and C-O stretching vibrations. In COCl-\nMWCNT spectrum, the peaks of 1710 and 1222 cm-1 are in correspondence to C=O, \nC-O stretching vibrations and the peak at 614 cm-1 can be assigned to C-Cl stretching \nvibrations of COCl functional groups. T-MWCNT and TA-MWCNT spectra shows \nabsorption bands at 1626 (amide carbonyl), 3402 (NH stretching), and 1150 cm-1 (C-\nN stretching and NH bending). They also show absorptions at 984 cm-1 associated \nwith the thiophene ring. In A-MWCNT and TA-MWCNT spectra, the peaks of C=O, \nC-O stretching vibration shifted to 1616 and 1243 cm-1 due to the formation of amide \nlinkage bonds. The peak at 1160 cm-1 is ascribed to C-N stretching of amide groups, \nwhile the peak at 3407 cm-1 can be assigned to the N-H stretching vibrations. A \nsimilar peak at about 3400 cm-1 in O-MWCNT and COCl-MWCNT can be assigned \nto the OH stretching vibrations of free carboxylic acid groups. This overlaps with N-H \nstretching vibrations in amine and thiophene mono- and bi- functionalized nanotubes \nspectra. The obtained results were similar to those reported elsewhere.21,25,26  \n1000 2000 3000 4000\nTh ring\nR-MWCNT\nTA-MWCNT\nA-MWCNT\nT-MWCNT\nCOCl-MWCNT\nO-MWCNT\nC-Cl\nC=O\nTr\na\nn\nsm\nitt\na\nn\nce\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nC-O\nCONH\nC=O\nN-H\nC-O\nC=O\nN-H\nTh ring\nC-O\nN-H\nC=O\nC-O\n \nFigue 4.

Comparison of current density-voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic \ncells of T-MWCNT, A-MWCNT, and TA-MWCNT incorporated and reference \nP3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction solar cells are also shown. \n \nFigure 5 shows the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics curves for the best \nperforming ITO\/P3HT:PCBM:MWCNT\/BCP\/Al photovoltaic cells with various \nfunctionalized MWCNTs. The extracted OPV characteristics for these cells;  as open-\ncircuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power \nconversion efficiency (\u03b7) are summarized in Table 1. The repeat runs of the cell \nfabrications show a distribution down to ~ 5% in terms of performance parameters, \nowing to the large area (0.76 cm2) design of the devices. The cell without nanotubes \nserves as a standard reference for the comparison of the power conversion efficiencies \n(PCE) and has a Jsc of 6.88 mA\/cm2, Voc of 0.55 V, and a FF of 60 %.  \nUnder the same conditions, the cells in the presence of functionalized MWCNT in the \nphotoactive layer exhibit different device characteristics and efficiencies. The cell \nwith the inclusion of T-MWCNT (0.3 w%) exhibits a maximum efficiency of 2.5 % \nwith a Jsc of 6.49 mA\/cm2, Voc of 0.62 V, and a FF of 62 %.  This device shows \nenhanced Voc and lower Jsc compared with the reference device. The Jsc shows a \ndependency on the molecular weight of the donor, which affects the microstructure \nformation at spin casting. Although previous studies have shown enhanced currents \nwith nanotube addition, due to the random distribution of nanotubes in the active \nlayers, they can act as recombination centres, depending on the nanotube density in \nthe acceptor phase. This may be the reason for the lower Jsc. The Voc of these systems \nis largely governed by the electronic properties of the donor and acceptor materials \nalong with properties at the electrode interfaces. The nanotubes in this case seem to \nmodify the electronic structure, resulting in enhanced Voc. \n9 \n \nWhen the concentration of T-MWCNT has been reduced to 0.15 %, the efficiency \nalso reduced to 2.1% (Table 1). The cell efficiency in the presence of A-MWCNT has \nbeen reduced to 1.6 % with a reduced Jsc and FF compared to the reference cell. When \na mixture of T-MWCNT:A-MWCNT (1:1, 0.3 w%) was incorporated into the cell, the \nefficiency is improved compared with the inclusion of A-MWCNT and the standard \nreference. The cell with the inclusion of bi-functional nanotubes, TA-MWCNT (0.15 \nw%), exhibits the efficiency of 2.1% with a Jsc of 6.45 mA\/cm2, Voc of 0.56 V, and a \nFF of 58 %. When the TA-MWCNT concentration is reduced to 0.075 w%, there is \nno significant change observed in the cell performance. \n \nTable 1.

Since the MWCNT is first mixed with P3HT \nduring solution blending, T-MWCNT can have higher tendencies to form a \ndiscontinuous network in the composite layer. This may be due to their structural \nsimilarities and nanotubes solubility. Similar effects may be observed in the case of a \nmixture (1:1 ratio) of thiophene and amine functionalized nanotubes when used in the \ncomposite layer. In the presence of both thiophene and amine functionalized \nnanotubes, more percolation networks are possible due to the chemical affinity \nbetween nanotubes and P3HT and PCBM.  However, the inclusion of nanotubes with \ndifferent chemical functionalities may increase the interface area of the P3HT\/CNT \nand PCBM\/CNT and modify the nanostructure of the bulk heterojunctions formed. \nThis also influences the performance of the photovoltaic cell. Many of the research \n10 \n \nreports in the literature suggested that the functionalized nanotubes increased the \nsolubility in organic solvents and allowed a more homogeneous polymer composite in \nthin film device fabrication.13, 26,29,30 It was also reported that nanotubes enhances \ncharge\/hole transport in photovoltaic devices, but this needs to be further verified \nprior to assuming a significant enhancement in the carrier transport. The \nphotogenerated excitons in the active composite layer can be dissociated at the \nP3HT\/PCBM, P3HT\/CNT and PCBM\/CNT interfaces, but the challenge is now to \nmove these charges in a quick and efficient manner to the electrodes of the devices.  \nIn conclusion, we have successfully prepared mono- and bi-functionalized MWCNT \nwith thiophene, amine and thiophene-amine groups. These nanotubes showed \nenhanced dispersion in organic solvents and allowed to prepare homogeneous \nsolutions for thin film device fabrication. This route the functionalized nanotubes \nhave been successfully incorporated into the photovoltaic devices is fully described in \nthis paper. The inclusion of nanotubes with different functional groups in the active \nlayer resulted in different cell performance compared to the reference cell with no \nnanotubes. The maximum efficiency of 2.5% was achieved with the inclusion of \nthiophene functionalized nanotubes. This improvement in the device performance \nmight be attributed to an extension of exciton dissociation area and to a better charge \ntransport through the nanotube network. This is postulated as being due to a more \nefficient dispersion of the nanotubes within the photoactive layer and their effective \ncompatibility. The inclusion of nanotubes with different chemical functionalities may \nalso modify the nanostructure of the bulk heterojunctions and subsequently influence \nthe cell efficiencies. \nThis report is based on a project funded by E.ON AG as part of the E.ON \nInternational Research Initiative.
