Introduction\n[2] The magnetospheric cusp regions always play an\nimportant role in the study of magnetic reconnection at\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetopause. Whatever process occurs at the\nmagnetopause, a signature of the process can be found in\nthe precipitating magnetosheath ions observed in the cusp\n[e.g., Lockwood and Smith, 1994; Onsager et al., 1993] as\nwell as down to the ionosphere where the foot points of all\nmagnetopause field lines converge to a relatively confined\nspace [e.g., Frey et al., 2003]. Plasma observations in the\ncusp in addition to in situ observations of field-aligned\nplasma flows close to the magnetopause (consistent with the\noccurrence of magnetic reconnection) have demonstrated\nthat the fundamental process of magnetic reconnection\noccurs somewhere at the magnetopause for any condition\nof the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) [e.g., Sonnerup et\nal., 1981; Gosling et al., 1991; Kessel et al., 1996; Phan et\nal., 1996; Fuselier et al., 2000a].\n[3] Precipitating ions in the cusp exhibit a distinctive\ndispersion profile caused by the joint action of newly\nopened convecting field lines and different flight times of\nthe ions from the injection point at the magnetopause to the\nobserving satellite. For a southward interplanetary magnetic\nfield and poleward convecting flux tubes, lower-energy\nparticles arrive at successively higher latitudes. This veloc-\nity filter effect for reconnection during southward IMF\nconditions was predicted by Rosenbauer et al. [1975] and\nfirst observed by Shelley et al. [1976].\n[4] For a steady rate of reconnection at the magnetopause,\nthe ion energy of downward precipitating ions should show\na smooth and continuous latitudinal dispersion on these\nopen field lines. This smooth dispersion is not often\nobserved. Instead these dispersions show complicated struc-\ntures known as \u2018\u2018stepped\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018staircase\u2019\u2019 cusp ion signa-\ntures with variations in flux levels and sudden changes in\nthe energy of the precipitating ions [e.g., Newell and Meng,\n1991; Escoubet et al., 1992]. These cusp steps have been\ninterpreted as both spatial and temporal structures.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A07S14, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012776, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Lockheed-Martin Advanced Technology Center, Palo Alto, California,\nUSA.\n2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n3European Space Research and Technology Centre, European Space\nAgency, Noordwijk, Netherlands.\n4Centre d\u2019Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, UMR 5187, CNRS,\nToulouse, France.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012776$09.00\nA07S14 1 of 11\n[5] While spatial cusp structures are the result of crossing\nthe boundary between spatially separated flux tubes [e.g.,\nOnsager et al., 1995; Wing et al., 2001; Trattner et al.,\n2002a], temporal structures are caused by variations of the\nreconnection rate with periods of little or no reconnection\nthat are interspersed with periods of continuous reconnec-\ntion. The existence of temporal cusp steps has been pre-\ndicted and is very well described in the pulsating cusp\nmodel [e.g., Cowley et al., 1991; Lockwood and Smith,\n1990; Smith et al., 1992] and supported by in situ observa-\ntions at the magnetopause [e.g., Russell and Elphic, 1979;\nFarrugia et al., 1998; McWilliams et al., 2004; Escoubet et\nal., 2006] and transient reconnection signatures in the\nionosphere [e.g., Lockwood and Smith, 1989, 1994]. This\npulsating cusp model reduces to a steady state cusp with\nconstant reconnection rate at one limit, and a cusp observed\nas a series of discrete events (bursts) at the other limit [Smith\nand Lockwood, 1990].\n[6] Multisatellite observations in combination with re-\nmote sensing methods like the FUV imager on the Imager\nfor Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)\nmission or the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Super-\nDARN) radar arrays have been used to distinguish between\nspatial and temporal cusp structures [e.g., Onsager et al.,\n1995; Wing et al., 2001; Trattner et al., 2002b, 2005]. The\nrecent progress in determining the location of the reconnec-\ntion site from 3-D plasma observations in the cusp, applied\nonto multiple cusp steps, provides an additional method\nwhich also distinguishes between spatial and temporal cusp\nstructures. This so-called low-velocity cutoff method [e.g.,\nOnsager et al., 1990] uses the velocity difference between\nprecipitating and mirroring ion distributions in the cusp to\nestimate the distance to the reconnection site, which is\nsubsequently traced back from the satellite position to the\nmagnetopause along the T96 model magnetic field lines\n[Tsyganenko, 1995]. Using this method on a Cluster double\ncusp event previously identified to be a spatial cusp struc-\nture resulted in bifurcated reconnection locations in differ-\nent hemispheres for the two cusp structures [Trattner et al.,\n2005].\n[7] It is the purpose of this study to investigate the spatial\nor temporal nature of \u2018\u2018step-up\u2019\u2019 cusp structures observed by\nthe Cluster satellites SC1 and SC4 on 23 September 2001.\nStep-up cusp structures are sudden increases in the energy\nof precipitating ions and are further used to determine the\nlocation of the reconnection site for this phenomenon in\norder to demonstrate that the low-velocity cutoff method\ncan also be used to distinguish between spatial and temporal\ncusp structures without requiring an additional source of\nmeasurements. Validating this aspect of the low-velocity\ncutoff method will provide a method for additional studies\nto analyze the periodicity of cusp structures as a function of\nsolar wind and IMF conditions and the location of the\nreconnection line.\n2. Instrumentation\n[8] In this paper we present proton observations from two\nCluster Ion Spectrometers (CIS) [Reme et al., 2001]. These\nspectrometers provide high-precision 3-D distributions for\nthe major ion species at energies from a few eV\/e to about\n40 keV\/e every 4 s (1 spin period) in the high-time\nresolution mode. The CIS instruments consist of two\ndifferent analyzers; the Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and the\ntime-of-flight Composition and Distribution Function Ana-\nlyzer (CODIF). This study will focus on proton observa-\ntions by the CODIF instrument on board SC1 and SC4\nwhich crossed the cusp at about the same time, making them\nideal for documenting the periodicity of a series of step-up\ncusp structures and their related changes in the reconnection\nrate as well as their convection to higher latitudes. The\nCODIF instrument on satellite SC3 was operational but the\nobservations are omitted in this study since SC3 was about\n40 min behind the leading pair of satellites and encountered\na different cusp precipitation profile (the sensor on SC2\nfailed early in the mission). All four identical Cluster\nsatellites were launched in pairs on 15 July and 9 August\n2000 into orbits with a perigee of \u00014 RE, an apogee of\n\u000119.7 RE, and an inclination of 90\u0001 [Escoubet et al., 2001].\nThe Cluster observations are supplemented with simulta-\nneous radar observations by the eight operating northern\nhemisphere SuperDARN radars.\n[9] In addition to the Cluster and SuperDARN data, IMF\nand the solar wind conditions were observed by the ACE\nMagnetic Field Instrument (MFI) [Smith et al., 1998] and\nthe ACE Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) [McComas et al.,\n1998], respectively. The IMF and solar wind data are\nprovided by the ISTP key parameter web page.\n3. Observations\n[10] Figure 1 shows omnidirectional H+ differential flux\nmeasurements (1\/(cm2 s sr keV\/e)) observed by the CIS\ninstruments on the Cluster satellites SC1 (Figure 1 (top))\nand SC4 (Figure 1 (bottom)) for the cusp crossings on 23\nSeptember 2001. Both Cluster satellites crossed into the\ncusp over Greenland and observed precipitating ions for the\ntime interval from about 11:00 UT to 11:50 UT. During the\ncusp crossing, the satellite covered an MLT range from\n11:40 to 12:08, an invariant latitude (INVLAT) range from\n74.6 to 78.9\u0001, and a geocentric distance from 4.7 to 5.1 RE.\nWhite regions in the color-coded flux plot indicate regions\nwith flux levels above the maximum indicated flux level in\nthe color bars.\n[11] The transition from closed field lines to open field\nlines is characterized and clearly visible by the sudden flux\nincrease at about 1 keV\/e. SC1 encounters precipitating\nmagnetosheath ions for the first time at 11:08:15 UT and is\nsubjected to several motions of the open-closed field line\nboundary which causes the satellite to exit and reenter the\ncusp three times before remaining on open cusp flux tubes\nat 11:11:25 UT.\n[12] Cluster SC1 subsequently encounters two classical\nstep-up cusp structures [e.g., Lockwood et al., 1998] em-\nbedded in the typical ion-energy dispersion profile during\nsouthward IMF conditions with lower-energy ions encoun-\ntered at higher latitudes [e.g., Reiff et al., 1977; Smith and\nLockwood, 1996]. The step-up cusp structures are marked\nwith white vertical lines in Figure 1 and occurred on\n11:18:36 UT at 76.27\u0001 INVLAT (1a) and 11:25:24 UT\nand 77.71\u0001 INVLAT (1b), respectively.\n[13] Cluster SC4 enters the cusp about one minute prior\nto SC1 at 11:07:14 UT but is not subjected to the same\nboundary motions that causes satellite SC1 to cross the\nA07S14 TRATTNER ET AL.: RECONNECTION LOCATION\n2 of 11\nA07S14\nopen-closed field line boundary several times. However,\nSC4 encounters a larger series of step-up cusp structures\nwith the first at 11:14:19 UT and 76\u0001 INVLAT (not\nmarked), the second at 11:19:24 UT at 77.22\u0001 INVLAT\n(4a) and the third at 11:26:33 UT at 78.94\u0001 INVLAT (4b).\nOnly the last two cusp step-up structures, which are in phase\nwith the previously discussed structures 1a and 1b, are\nmarked with vertical white lines.\n[14] The first step-up cusp structure observed by SC4 was\nnot encountered by SC1, which is most probably caused by\nthe periodicity of this particular event. The step-up cusp\nstructures for the 23 September 2001 Cluster cusp crossing\nare separated by about 7 min (time difference between 1a\nand 1b and between 4a and 4b). By subtracting 7 min from\nthe time SC1 encountered cusp structure 1a we estimate a\ntime of about 11:12 UT; close to the time SC1 crossed the\nopen-closed field line boundary for the final time. At this\npoint SC1 encountered a newly opened flux tube but missed\nthe change in the reconnection rate that launched the\ntemporal cusp step encountered by the poleward located\nSC4 satellite at about 11:14 UT. The timings and positions\nwhen and where cusp structures are encountered by the\nCluster satellites are also influenced by the unknown motion\nof the open-closed field line boundary.\n[15] It should be noted that the \u00017 min periodicity of the\ncusp steps for the 23 September 2001 event is in agreement\nwith the 8 min average periodicity of FTE\u2019s observed at the\nmagnetopause [Rijnbeek et al., 1984; Russell et al., 1996].\nA similar result was reported by Lockwood and Wild [1993],\nwhere they found that the time between successive FTE\u2019s\nvaries from 1.5 to 18.5 min with an average of 8 min and a\nmost common value of 3 min. Smith and Lockwood [1990]\npointed out that the reconnection rate variations thought to\nbe responsible for magnetopause FTE\u2019s should also cause\nthe cusp to vary on timescales of about 2\u201320 min.\n[16] Figure 2 shows solar wind conditions for the Cluster\ncusp crossing on 23 September 2001 observed by the ACE\/\nSWE and MFI experiments. The solar wind data in Figure 2\nhave been propagated by about 45 min to account for the\ntravel time along the Sun-Earth line from the ACE space-\ncraft to the magnetopause. For the solar wind travel time\ncalculation we have used bow shock and magnetopause\nlocations derived from using the measured solar wind\nconditions together with Farris and Russell\u2019s [1994] bow\nshock model and Petrinec and Russell\u2019s [1996] magneto-\npause model. In addition, a reduced solar wind speed of 1\/4\nthe upstream speed was assigned between the bow shock\nand the magnetopause.

For the time of interest the components average to\nabout (3, \u000210, \u00023) nT, which represents an IMF clock\nangle of 254\u0001.\n[18] The combination of the Cluster observations together\nwith simultaneous ground observations by the SuperDARN\nradar array has previously demonstrated the importance of\nmultispacecraft\/multiinstrument studies to understand and\nsuccessfully separate the temporal from the spatial scale\n[e.g., Trattner et al., 2003]. Figure 3 shows two composite\nplots that combine the temporal and spatial separations of\nthe Cluster spacecraft in the cusp with ionospheric convec-\ntion cells derived from SuperDARN radar observations.\nFigure 3 (top and bottom) are centered on the time when\nSC1 encounters the step-up cusp structures 1a and 1b,\nrespectively.\n[19] For Figure 3, the blue and red curves show the\nmagnetic foot points of Cluster satellites SC1 and SC4 in\nthe ionosphere, respectively. The foot points are plotted on\ntop of geographical maps of the Greenland area. Overlaid\nalong the magnetic foot points are the omnidirectional H+\ndifferential flux measurements (1\/(cm2 s sr keV\/e)) shown\nin Figure 1. Measurements from the lowest-energy channel\nof the Cluster\/CIS instruments are plotted at the magnetic\nfoot points with higher energies extending away from the\nfoot points. The color coding for the spectrograms is the\nsame as in Figure 1.\n[20] To clearly separate the temporal from the spatial\nscale, only 14 min wide sections of the color spectrograms\nshown in Figure 1 are attached to the magnetic foot points.\nWhite curves in the color spectrograms mark the position of\nthe respective satellites for the time index. The extension of\nthe color spectrogram equatorward of the white curves\nshows past measurements while the extension of the color\nspectrograms poleward of the white curves depicts future\nmeasurements of the CIS instruments when the Cluster\nsatellites have progressed to those positions along the\nmagnetic foot points.\n[21] White solid curves in Figure 3 represent the average\nlocation of the auroral oval.

Vertical black lines indicate the times when\nCluster satellite SC1 encountered the two distinctive ion cusp steps 1a and 1b shown in Figure 1.\nA07S14 TRATTNER ET AL.: RECONNECTION LOCATION\n4 of 11\nA07S14\nhave been calculated using the technique of Ruohoniemi\nand Baker [1998], and are presented as equipotential con-\ntours. Here the fit to the line-of-sight data is made to a sixth-\norder spherical harmonic expansion, with the fit stabilized\nby a statistical pattern keyed to the upstream IMF data from\nthe ACE satellite, delayed by 45 min to allow for the\npropagation time from the spacecraft to the magnetopause\n[Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996]. Such an equipotential\nmap represents a best estimate of the global ionospheric\nflow response to the magnetopause processes sensed by the\nin situ spacecraft.\n[22] The Cluster satellites over Greenland moved pole-\nward and oblique to the ionospheric convection direction as\nderived from the radar data. At 11:18:36 UT (Figure 3\n(top)), SC1 encountered the first step-up cusp structure (1a).\nSC4, positioned just downstream and about 1\u0001 poleward of\nSC1 along the convection path, encountered a similar step\nmarked (4a) about 1 min later.\n[23] The same scenario repeats for the second set of step-\nup cusp structures shown in Figure 3 (bottom). SC1\nencountered the second step-up cusp structure at 11:25:24\nUT (1b). The first pair of cusp structures 1a and 4a are still\nvisible in the color spectrogram at lower latitudes. SC4,\npositioned again just downstream and poleward of SC1,\nencountered a similar step marked (4b) about one minute\nlater and 1\u0001 higher in latitude. Observing a similar step\nfeature about 1\u0001 higher in latitude and about 1 min later than\nthe low-latitude satellite is consistent with a convecting\ntemporal cusp structure as predicted by the pulsed recon-\nnection model [see also Lockwood and Smith, 1989, 1990].\n[24] Both step-up cusp structures observed by one space-\ncraft seem to have convected 1\u0001 poleward in the direction of\nthe convection path within about 1 min (1.19\u0001\/min and\n0.98\u0001\/min for the first and second pair of step-up cusp\nstructures, respectively). That represents a convection ve-\nlocity of about 1.8 km\/s, in agreement with the observed\nconvection speed in the ionosphere of about 1.2 km\/s, as\nmeasured by the SuperDARN radars [see also Lockwood et\nal., 1990; Pinnock et al., 1993].\n[25] Both Cluster cusp crossings are further investigated\nto determine the location of the reconnection line at the\nmagnetopause for the cusp structures in an effort to estab-\nlish if these temporal reconnection pulses originated at the\nsame reconnection line. As described above, precipitating\nions in the cusp exhibit a so-called time-of-flight effect\nwhich, under southward IMF conditions, causes particles\nwith decreasing energy to arrive at successively higher\nlatitudes [e.g., Rosenbauer et al., 1975; Shelley et al.,\n1976]. This time-of-flight effect of cusp precipitating ions\ntogether with a method first used by Onsager et al. [1990,\n1991] in the Earth\u2019s plasma sheet boundary layer (to\nestimate the distance to the tailward reconnection site) can\nbe used to estimate the distance to the dayside reconnection\nsite. The procedure is generally known as the low-velocity\ncutoff method and was successfully used in several studies\nto determine the location of the dayside reconnection site\nFigure 3.

Overlaid on the magnetic foot\npoints are 14 min wide sections of the Cluster\/CIS H+ flux\nmeasurements presented in Figure 1, with increasing energy\naway from the foot points and centered on the actual\nposition of the Cluster satellites at 11:18.36 UT and\n11:25.34 UT (marked by white curves within the color\nspectrograms). SC1 and SC4 are deep inside the cusp and\nare moving oblique to the convection direction of the dusk\nconvection cell. Cluster satellite SC4 is always located at\nhigher latitudes than SC1 and encounters the same sequence\nof cusp steps observed by SC1 about 1 min later and 1\u0001\nhigher in latitude; the typical signature of a temporal\nconvecting cusp structure [Trattner et al., 2007a].\nA07S14 TRATTNER ET AL.: RECONNECTION LOCATION\n5 of 11\nA07S14\nduring northward and southward IMF conditions [e.g.,\nFuselier et al., 2000b; Trattner et al., 2004, 2007b].\n[26] For an observing satellite in the cusp at any time,\nprotons near the low-velocity cutoffs in the parallel and\nantiparallel propagating populations originate near the re-\nconnection site. The equal arrival times of the parallel and\nantiparallel propagating ions at these cutoffs and the known\ndistance from the satellite to the mirror point in the\nionosphere are used to estimate the distance to the recon-\nnection line. The distance to the reconnection site Xr is\ndefined by:\nXr=Xm \u00bc 2 Ve= Vm \u0002 Ve\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Xm is the distance to the ionospheric mirror point\ndetermined by using the position of the Cluster satellites in\nthe cusp and tracing the geomagnetic field line at this\nposition down to the ionosphere along model magnetic field\nlines of the T96 model. Ve is the cutoff velocity of the\nprecipitating (earthward propagating) ion distribution, and\nVm is the cutoff velocity of the mirrored ion distribution\n[e.g., Onsager et al., 1990; Fuselier et al., 2000b],\ndetermined from the three-dimensional proton observations\nby the CIS instrument in the cusp.\n[27] Apart from using the T96 model to define Xm in\nequation (1), the calculation of the distance to the recon-\nnection site is model independent. However, to locate the\nreconnection site at the magnetopause and to determine the\nlocal conditions at the site requires additional modeling.\n[28] The calculated distance to the reconnection site Xr is\ntraced back to the magnetopause along T96 model magnetic\nfield lines, starting at the position of the Cluster satellites in\nFigure 4.

Precipitating\nmagnetosheath ions move along the magnetic field toward the ionosphere with a velocity of about\n420 km\/s (marked with a dashed line (Figure 4 (top)) and a solid line (Figure 4 (bottom))), while the\nmirrored distribution from the ionosphere is observed at about \u0002670 km\/s. Also marked are the 1\/e cutoff\nvelocities at the low-speed side of the precipitating and mirrored distributions.

This study assumes that no electric fields directed\nalong the reconnected field lines are present which would\naffect the distance calculation. A detailed discussion about\nthe errors related to the field line tracing of the calculated\ndistance to the magnetopause and the errors in the determi-\nnation of the local conditions at the reconnection site found\nby Trattner et al. [2007b].\n[29] Figure 4 (top) shows a two-dimensional cut through\nthe three-dimensional distribution measured by the CIS\ninstrument on Cluster SC1 for the time interval from\n11:13:25 UT to 11:13:37 UT on 23 September 2001. Plotted\nis flux in the frame where the bulk flow velocity\nperpendicular to the magnetic field is zero. The plane of\nthe two-dimensional cut contains the magnetic field direc-\ntion (y axis) and the axis parallel to the Sun\u2013Earth line.\nThree-dimensional flux measurements from the CIS instru-\nment within \u00b145\u0001 of this plane are rotated into the plane and\naveraged by preserving total energy and pitch angle to\nproduce the distribution in Figure 4 (top) [see also Fuselier\net al., 2000b; Trattner et al., 2007b].\n[30] Below the two-dimensional distribution is a cut\nthrough the distribution along the magnetic field direction\n(along the y axis of Figure 4 (top)). The solid line shows the\nmeasured flux level for this cut. For Figure 4, distributions\nwith positive velocities are moving parallel to the geomag-\nnetic field toward the ionosphere, while distributions with\nnegative velocities are moving away from the ionosphere,\nantiparallel to the magnetospheric field.\n[31] The peak of the precipitating magnetosheath distri-\nbution in Figure 4 is easily identified as the only peak at\npositive velocities at about 420 km\/s. At negative velocities,\nthree peaks are identified, representing the mirrored mag-\nnetosheath distribution at \u0002670 km\/s; an additional peak at\n\u0002380 km\/s which is lower than the velocity of the precip-\nitating ion peak, and the ionospheric ion outflow distribu-\ntion around 0 km\/s, which is often observed at these\nlatitudes [e.g., Yau et al., 1985; Peterson et al., 2001].\n[32] The precipitating and mirrored ion peaks are marked\nwith vertical solid lines (Figure 4 (bottom)) and horizontal\ndashed lines (Figure 4 (top)). The low-velocity cutoff of the\ndistributions is defined at the low-speed side of each beam\nwhere the flux is 1\/e lower than the peak flux [see also\nFuselier et al., 2000b; Trattner et al., 2005, 2007b]. The\nions with velocities below the cutoff velocities of the\nprecipitating and mirrored beams are either injected onto\nthe open convecting field lines later and closer to the\nobserving satellite or represent ionospheric ion outflow.\n[33] To ensure a clear reproducible identification of the 1\/e\ncutoff velocity in this region, especially for the mirrored\ndistribution close to other distributions and ionospheric\noutflow peaks, the two-dimensional cuts of the Cluster\/CIS\nobservations are fitted with Gaussian distributions (blue\ncurves) that are subsequently used to mark the 1\/e reduced\nflux levels at the low-speed sides of the peak fluxes.\n[34] Figure 5 shows the distance of the reconnection line\nversus time for all Cluster CIS1 (Figure 5 (top)) and CIS4\n(Figure 5 (bottom)) 3-D distributions of the 23 September\n2001 cusp crossing for which clearly separated low-velocity\ncutoffs could be observed. The uncertainties in the distance\ncalculations arise primarily from the uncertainties in mea-\nsuring the low-velocity cutoffs and are defined as half the\ndifference between the velocity at the peak flux and the\ncutoff velocity [e.g., Fuselier et al., 2000b]. The distances\nto the reconnection sites over the entire cusp crossings are\nrelatively stable with a weighted average of 11.8 \u00b1 3.1 RE\nfor SC1 and 9.6 \u00b1 1.8 RE for SC4.\n[35] These distance calculations show that the distance\nfrom the satellite to the injection point at the magnetopause\nremained stable for the entire cusp crossing, including the\ntemporal step-up cusp structures. This is in contrast to an\nFigure 5. The distance to the reconnection line for ion-energy dispersions observed by the Cluster (top)\nSC1 and (bottom) SC4 on 23 September 2001. Each diamond represents a 3-D measurement by the CIS\ninstrument, analyzed with the method described in this paper. These distances are subsequently used in\nthe field line trace to follow the first closed T96 field line at the same local time position of the respective\nsatellites back to the magnetopause.\nA07S14 TRATTNER ET AL.: RECONNECTION LOCATION\n7 of 11\nA07S14\nearlier investigation about the reconnection site of spatial\ncusp structures [Trattner et al., 2005] where the reconnec-\ntion locations for the two step-up cusp structures mapped to\ndifferent hemispheres. This seems not to be the case for\nthese temporal cusp structures.\n[36] It should be noted that it is in general easier and more\nreliable to perform the distance calculation close to the\nopen-closed field line boundary. At higher latitudes away\nfrom the open-closed field line boundary, the precipitating,\nmirrored and ionospheric outflow distributions start to\nmerge into one almost isotropic distribution. Because of\nthis effect, the distance calculations for the 23 September\n2001 Cluster cusp event also contains distance calculations\nfrom ion measurements prior to the observations of the step-\nup cusp structures but misses values from cusp structure 4b.\nHowever, all measurements that led to a distance calculation\nshow similar values, pointing to the same reconnection\nlocation.\n[37] Figure 6 shows the magnetopause shear angle as\nseen from the sun and the location of the reconnection site\n(black square symbols) for the SC1 and SC4 cusp crossings\non 23 September 2001. For the determination of the\nmagnetic shear angles across the dayside magnetopause,\nwe use the Cooling et al. [2001] analytical model at the\nmagnetopause as the external (magnetosheath) magnetic\nfield. The Cooling et al. [2001] magnetic field model is a\nrestricted version of the Kobel and Flu\u00a8ckiger [1994] more\ngeneral model (which is an analytic representation of the\nmagnetic field throughout the magnetosheath). For the\ninternal (magnetosphere) magnetic field, the T96 model at\nthe Sibeck et al. [1991] ellipsoidal magnetopause is\nemployed. Although these two magnetopause shapes are\nsimilar, they are not identical. Thus, a mapping of the\ndraped magnetosheath field conditions along the boundary\nnormal onto the Sibeck et al. [1991] magnetopause is\nperformed to bring these two shapes into agreement.\n[38] Red areas in Figure 6 represent regions where the\ngeomagnetic fields and the draped IMF are antiparallel\nwhile blue and black areas represent regions where the\nmerging fields become parallel. The antiparallel reconnec-\ntion regions for the Cluster cusp crossing are bifurcated and\nlocated in the southern dusk and northern dawn region (IMF\nclock angle of 254\u0001). The black circle represents the\nlocation of the terminator plane as it intersects the magne-\ntopause. The dashed white line represents the line of\nmaximum magnetic shear across the magnetopause.\n[39] The reconnection site for the Cluster cusp event is\nmarked in Figure 6 with black square symbols. The location\nof the symbols was determined by tracing the calculated\ndistance to the reconnection site (Figure 5) along T96 model\nmagnetic field lines back to the magnetopause. The symbols\ncluster around the subsolar point and far away from the\nantiparallel reconnection sites at high latitudes. During the\nequinoxes, the subsolar region is also crossed by the line of\nmaximum magnetic shear. This component reconnection\ntilted X-line is consistent with a statistical study of 130 Polar\ncusp crossings during southward IMF conditions by\nTrattner et al. [2007b] who showed that the reconnection\nFigure 6.

In contrast, spatial cusp structures originate\nfrom different reconnection lines [Trattner et al., 2005].\nDetermining the reconnection location on the magnetopause\nfor cusp structures can therefore also be used to distinguish\nbetween spatial and temporal phenomena.\n4. Summary and Conclusion\n[41] The merging of space-based particle measurements\nwith global imaging technology and ground-based measure-\nments has proven to be tremendously helpful in providing\nnew insights into the nature of magnetic reconnection at the\nmagnetopause. Particularly useful are the techniques for\ndistinguishing spatial from temporal processes, avoiding the\nambiguity of single satellite observations. Despite the suc-\ncess of the pulsed reconnection model [e.g., Lockwood et\nal., 1998] which explains the cusp and the reconnection\nprocess as a series of discrete reconnection pulses, multi-\nsatellite observations during stable solar wind and IMF\nconditions also showed spatial features not consistent with\nthe pulsed reconnection model (e.g., DE-1 and DE-2\n[Onsager et al., 1995], Interball-Polar [Trattner et al.,\n1999], DMSP [Wing et al., 2001], FAST-Polar [Trattner et\nal., 2002a, 2002b], Polar-SuperDARN-IMAGE [Trattner et\nal., 2005]).\n[42] In this study we have analyzed the 23 September\n2001 Cluster cusp crossing in an effort to determine its\nspatial or temporal nature and document the location of the\nreconnection site from which the observed step-up cusp\nstructures originated. An earlier Cluster study of spatial\ncusp structure by Trattner et al. [2005] revealed that spatial\ncusp structures originated in different hemispheres at bifur-\ncated reconnection lines in the antiparallel reconnection\nregion. This result was also confirmed with images from\nthe FUV instrument on the IMAGE spacecraft which\nshowed the typical ionospheric response to precipitating\ncusp ions originating at the antiparallel reconnection region\nin different hemispheres.\n[43] Combining Cluster SC1 and SC4 ion observations in\nthe cusp with the SuperDARN radar observations reveals\nthat the step-up ion-energy dispersions are convecting\nwithin the dusk convection cell and do not cross the\nboundary between the convection cells. The convection\nspeed of the cusp structures was determined to be about\n1\u0001\/min which translates into 1.8 km\/s, in agreement with the\nconvection speed measured by the SuperDARN radar in the\nionosphere of about 1.2 km\/s.\n[44] In addition the reconnection site for the temporal\ncusp structures has been determined. The reconnection site\nallows for distinction between the reconnection models.\nThese two models are (1) antiparallel reconnection where\nshear angles between the magnetospheric field and the IMF\nare near 180\u0001 and (2) component reconnection where shear\nangles between the merging fields are as low as 50\u0001\n[Gosling et al., 1982, 1990].\n[45] One popular component reconnection model is the\ntilted neutral line model [e.g., Sonnerup, 1974; Cowley,\n1976; Sonnerup et al., 1981; Cowley and Owen, 1989;\nFuselier et al., 2002] which predicts that a neutral line runs\nacross the dayside magnetosphere through the subsolar\nregion regardless of the magnitude of the By component.\nThe magnitude of the By component would only determine\nthe tilt of the neutral line relative to the equatorial plane.\n[46] Both reconnection scenarios have a profound impact\non the location of the X-line and the plasma transfer into the\nmagnetosphere. Earlier studies provided clear evidence that\neither the antiparallel reconnection scenario [e.g., Gosling et\nal., 1991] or the component reconnection tilted X-line\nscenario [e.g., Onsager and Fuselier, 1994; Sandholt et\nal., 1998; Fuselier et al., 1997; Onsager et al., 2001] occur\nat the magnetopause.\n[47] In a recent statistical study by Trattner et al. [2007b],\nthe authors have tested the antiparallel and tilted X-line\nreconnection models by investigating 130 Polar cusp cross-\nings during southward IMF conditions during variable IMF\nand solar wind conditions. The study revealed that, depend-\ning on IMF conditions, either type of reconnection can\noccur. For southward IMF conditions (or up to 20\u000230\u0001\nfrom the southward direction), reconnection occurs where\nthe merging fields are exactly antiparallel, often bifurcating\nto the northern and southern cusp depending on the dipole\ntilt and the IMF BX component. For all other IMF orienta-\ntions a tilted X-line crossing the dayside magnetopause\nis formed which basically follows the location of the line of\nmaximum magnetic shear across the magnetopause. The\nstudy also revealed a very pronounced seasonal effect for\nthe tilted X-line model that \u2018\u2018pushes\u2019\u2019 the reconnection\nlocation to the south or to the north in the northern hemi-\nsphere summer and winter months, respectively. Exceptions\nare large IMF Bx cases with jBxj\/B > 0.7, for which\nreconnection switches back to antiparallel reconnection.\n[48] To calculate the distance to the reconnection site for\nthe cusp ion-energy dispersion events observed by Cluster\nsatellites, we use 3-D ion observations by the CIS instru-\nments to extract the low-velocity cutoffs of the downward\nprecipitating and the mirrored magnetosheath distributions\nin the cusp. This information is used in a time-of-flight\nmodel [see Onsager et al., 1990; Fuselier et al., 2000b] to\ncalculate the distance to the reconnection site.\n[49] The weighted average distances to the reconnection\nsites are 11.8 \u00b1 3.1 RE and 9.6 \u00b1 1.8 RE for SC1 and SC4,\nrespectively. These calculated distances to the reconnection\nsite are relatively stable over the entire cusp pass, including\nthe temporal step-up structures. Temporal convecting cusp\nstructures originate at the same reconnection line in contrast\nto spatial cusp structures, which originated from vastly\ndifferent locations in different hemispheres. The unchanged\nlocation of the reconnection line confirms that the step-up\nstructures seen in Figure 1 are entirely temporal in nature.\nTo create a step-up cusp structure in ion-energy dispersion\nprofiles originating at the same magnetopause location, a\ndrastic change in the reconnection rate must have occurred.\n[50] The calculated distance to the reconnection site was\nsubsequently traced back to the magnetopause along the\ngeomagnetic field starting at the position of the Cluster\nsatellites by using a semiempirical magnetic field model\nA07S14 TRATTNER ET AL.: RECONNECTION LOCATION\n9 of 11\nA07S14\n(T96). The study revealed that the temporal ion-energy\ndispersion events for the 23 September 2001 Cluster cusp\nevent originated in the vicinity of the subsolar point, in\nagreement with the tilted X-line model. The result is also in\nagreement with the statistical study by Trattner et al.\n[2007b] who determined that for a cusp event during\nequinox with an IMF clock angle of 254\u0001, the reconnection\nline would be along the line of maximum magnetic shear\ncrossing the subsolar point (tilted X-line).\n[51] This result demonstrates that the distance to the\nreconnection line can also be used to distinguish spatial\nfrom temporal cusp structures. In addition, with the ability\nto distinguish between the spatial and temporal nature of\ncusp structures, we now can systematically document the\nperiodicity of temporal cusp structures as a function of solar\nwind and IMF conditions and the location of the reconnec-\ntion line, and therefore also ascertain the variability of the\nreconnection rate.\n[52] The periodicity of the cusp structures for the\n23 September 2001 event was about 7 min which is in\nagreement with the average periodicity of about 8 min\nreported for FTE\u2019s observed at the magnetopause [Rijnbeek\net al., 1984; Russell et al., 1996; Lockwood and Wild,\n1993]. Le et al. [1993] reported no evidence that FTE\u2019s\nare directly correlated with the southward turning of the\nIMF but seem to occur more frequently when IMF Bz is\nsteady. This result was supported by Russell et al. [1996],\nwho foundno evidence for a connection betweenoutside drivers\nand the occurrence rate of FTE\u2019s. In contrast, Lockwood and\nWild [1993] suggested that FTE\u2019s are driven by IMF variations\nin which the Bz component becomes more southward. Such\na behavior was evident during the 23 September 2001\nCluster cusp crossing as shown in Figure 2. For the time\nof interest the southward IMF Bz component increased\nsharply twice with a periodicity of about 7 min in sequence\nwith the appearance of cusp steps.\n[53] Furthermore, recent observations suggested that tem-\nporal cusp structures caused by variations of the reconnec-\ntion rate at the magnetopause (FTE\u2019s) are related to\ncomponent reconnection sites [Fuselier et al., 2007]. This\nrelationship can be tested by applying the low-velocity\ncutoff method to temporal structures.\n[54] Acknowledgments. We acknowledge the use of ISTP KP data-\nbase.
