New transitions and levels are tentatively placed\nin the level scheme of 32Mg from an analysis of \u03b3 -\u03b3 and \u03b2-\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences. The observation of the indirect\nfeeding of the 2321 keV state in 32Mg removes some restrictions previously placed on the spin assignment for\nthis state. No evidence of a state at 2117 keV in 32Mg is found. Previously unobserved weak transitions up to\n5.4 MeV were recorded but could not be placed in the decay scheme of 32Na.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.75.017302 PACS number(s): 23.20.\u2212g, 23.40.\u2212s, 27.30.+t\nThe structure of nuclei along the valley of stability is\nwell understood in terms of the traditional magic numbers,\ncorresponding to large gaps in single-particle energy levels of\nnucleons in realistic mean-field theories including a spin-orbit\ninteraction. The evolution of the shell closures far from\nstability is, however, a subject of intense scrutiny. In particular,\nexperimental studies have shown a breaking of magicity of\nthe N = 20 [1\u20133] and the N = 28 [4,5] configurations for\nneutron-rich nuclei. Key nuclei in their respective regions,\nsuch as 32Mg and 44S, display large quadrupole collectivity\narising from their prolate deformation. Over the years (and\nwith the steady increase of computing power), shell model\ncalculations have led to a better understanding of the magicity\ndisappearance in certain regions of the nuclear chart (for a\nrecent review, see Ref. [6] and references therein). In the\ncase of the N = 20 shell closure, the so-called \u201cisland of\ninversion\u201d around 32Mg is due to low energy fp-intruder states\ncompeting with the standard sd-orbitals, giving rise to the\ndeformed configurations.\nDespite many experimental studies, significant features of\nthe 32Mg level scheme are still unknown. In fact, only the first\nexcited state at 885 keV is firmly assigned as a 2+ state [7].\nThe other excited states have, at best, only received a tentative\nassignment. Of interest is the location of the 4+ state to shed\n*Corresponding author.

Azaiez\net al. [8] propose that this state is located at 2315(15) keV\nin agreement with a 2321 keV state previously observed in\nthe \u03b2-decay of 32Na [2]. Recently, a state in the vicinity of\n2.31 MeV was also suggested in the two-proton knockout\nreaction of 34Si, and assumed to be the 4+ state [9]. However,\nconflicting evidence exists. With a tentative assignment of\n(3\u2212,4\u2212) for the 32Na ground state, a 4+ state in 32Mg would\nnot be strongly populated by the \u03b2-decay of 32Na. Klotz\net al. [2] have not observed any evidence that the 2321 keV\nstate is populated from higher excited states. Moreover, an\nintermediate energy Coulomb excitation experiment similarly\nproposed the existence of a 2321 keV state, and suggested\nthree possible assignments (not including 4+), namely\n(1\u2212,1+,2+) [10]. Finally, the inelastic scattering of 32Mg has\nled to the observation of an excited state, identified possibly\nas the 2321 keV excited state with a suggested spin and parity\nof 3\u2212 [11]. Clearly, a new study of the \u03b2-decay of 32Na is\nneeded to help resolve the discrepancies in the 32Mg level\nscheme.\nThe \u03b2-decay of 32Na has been investigated at ISAC\/\nTRIUMF with the 8\u03c0 spectrometer, instrumented with the\nSCintillating Electron Positron Tagging ARray (SCEPTAR)\n[12] and a fast mylar tape transport system. Gamma rays\nwere measured with the 8\u03c0 spectrometer, an array of 20\nhigh-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors [13], while beta\nparticles were detected with SCEPTAR, a near 4\u03c0 inner array\nof twenty 1.6 mm thick plastic scintillating detectors located\n1.5 cm from the center of the 8\u03c0 . Each plastic scintillator\nin SCEPTAR is in one-to-one correspondance with a HPGe\ndetector of the 8\u03c0 , i.e., each HPGe detector views the central\nfocus of the array through primarily one SCEPTAR element.\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(1)\/017302(4) 017302-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 017302 (2007)\nFIG. 1. Gamma spectrum obtained using both tape cycle data sets by requiring \u03b2-\u03b3 coincidences and after bremsstrahlung veto (see\ntext), with known 30,31,32Mg lines identified. Transitions identified by \u2217 are candidates for belonging to the level schemes of 30,31,32Mg. (see\ntable I)\nFinally, the mylar tape intercepts the ion beam at the center of\nboth arrays. The tape transport system is fully programmable\nand interfaced to ISAC beam controls. Such a combination\nprovides a powerful selection tool both by requiring events in\n\u03b2-\u03b3 coincidences and by allowing the removal of long-lived\nprogeny.\n32Na atoms were produced by bombarding a 22.4 g\/cm2\ntantalum target with a 40 \u00b5A 500 MeV proton beam. An\nestimated 2\u20133 32Na atoms per second were extracted by surface\nionization and delivered to the 8\u03c0 experimental station, where\nthey were implanted into the moving tape. During the 126 h\nof effective data taking, two settings were used for the tape\ntransport operation. In the \u201ccontinuous\u201d mode, the mylar\ntape moved at a constant speed of 80 cm\/s while beam was\ncontinuously delivered. In the \u201csix-seconds\u201d mode, the tape\nwas held stationary for 6 sec while beam was delivered, then\nthe beam was turned off and the tape was moved 45 cm out\nof the focus of the array. Data were first collected using a\nhardware event trigger requiring \u03b2-\u03b3 coincidences; the trigger\nwas later upgraded to also include \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences.\nIn offline analysis, more event selections are made possible\nby the use of the SCEPTAR array. The neutron-rich nuclei of\ninterest in this experiment decay with high Q-values, leading\nto the emission of high-energy electrons. When interacting\nin SCEPTAR, these high-energy electrons in turn produce\nbremsstrahlung photons in the direction of the HPGe detector\ncolinear to the given SCEPTAR detector. This source of back-\nground is considerably reduced by vetoing \u03b2-\u03b3 coincidences\noccuring in a paired plastic scintillator\/HPGe detector at a\ncost of losing 5% of the overall \u03b2-\u03b3 coincidences. Although\nthe SCEPTAR elements are thin, it is possible to use the\ndigitized energy loss information recorded by the detectors\nto discriminate against very low Q-value \u03b2 decays, when the\nelectrons are stopped rather than slowed down in SCEPTAR.\nThis proved useful to remove the contributions from 28Mg,\nthe long-lived daughter of 28Na originally delivered during\nbeam tuning. The 28Mg nuclei decay primarily (95%) through\nthe 1373 keV state in 28Al with a Q-value of only 460 keV.\nIt is however not possible to reject the 1778.9 keV \u03b3 ray\nfollowing the \u03b2-decay of 28Al (I\u03b3 = 100%), because the\nQ-value of the decay is too large. This \u03b3 ray obscures the\nknown 1783 keV transition in 32Mg. A gate on the \u03b2-\u03b3\ncoincidence timing is also included in the offline analysis to\nreject uncorrelated events. The final \u03b3 ray spectrum is shown\nin Fig. 1. The spectrum shows no evidence of contributions\nfrom high-mass contaminants in higher charge states.\nA relative efficiency curve was fit to data taken with\n152Eu, 133Ba, and 56Co sources immediately following the\nexperiment. The curve was later complemented by the mea-\nsurement of the known EC-decay [14] of 66Ga. The 66Ga\nsource was produced at ISAC with a ZrC target, extracted\nby laser ionization and implanted in a stationary tape at\nthe center of the arrays in the same experimental configu-\nration as in the 32Na \u03b2-decay measurement. The resulting\nrelative efficiency curve spanned a range from 121 keV to\n4806 keV and agreed well, once normalized, with predictions\nfrom GEANT4 [15] in the 1 to 5 MeV region (the GEANT\nsimulation did not take threshold effects into account, leading\nto some disagreement at low energy). Efficiencies for \u03b3 rays\nhigher than 4.8 MeV were extrapolated from the GEANT\nefficiency curve.\nThe intensities from this work are compared to those found\nby Klotz et al. [2] and by Guillemaud-Mueller et al. [16]\nin Table I. Reasonably good agreement is found with some\nexceptions. Disagreements observed with Ref. [2] at low and\nhigh energy could be explained by systematic errors in their\nefficiency calibration. In our work and in Ref. [2], the \u03b3 ray\nat 1783 keV is obscured by a different contaminant (28Al in\npresent work), and so the intensity remains referenced from\nthe earlier work [16]. A notable disagreement at 1973 keV\nmay be attributed to the observed presence of the contaminant\n128In in [2]: 128In \u03b2-decays to 128Sn with t1\/2 = 0.72 s, and\nincludes a 20% \u03b3 branch at 1973.86 keV.

Analysis\nof \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences suggests that this contribution may be\nsmall in our case, because most of our data were taken in\n\u201ccontinuous mode\u201d, where the progeny decays were partly\nrejected. Finally, a significant disagreement is observed for\nthe 240 keV transition in 31Mg with [16].\nSeveral previously unobserved \u03b3 transitions are found with\nintensity greater than \u223c1% relative to the 885 keV transition\nin 32Mg (see Fig. 1 and Table I). Gamma transitions, for which\nthe intensity is attenuated by more than a factor of 2 under the\n\u03b2-energy cut, are rejected as belonging to a low Q-value decay,\nsuch as 28Al. Next, the ratio of intensities of the two tape modes\nis considered. The \u201ccontinuous\u201d operation mode favors the\ndetection of the \u03b2-decay of 32Na over its longer-lived progeny,\nwhile the \u201csix-seconds\u201d mode yields a much larger contri-\nbution of progeny decays. The ratio of intensities I6s\/Icont is\nexpected to increase with the lifetime of the parent. Indeed, this\nFIG. 2.

A ratio near unity is therefore considered\na good indication that the given transition belongs to the decay\nof 32Na. Eight \u03b3 rays are found to satisfy this condition.\nFinally, \u03b3 -\u03b3 and \u03b2-\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences are inspected for\nplacement of those eight transitions in the decay scheme of\n32Na. An offline 50 ns coincidence gate is set to select the \u03b3\ncoincidence events. As shown in Fig. 2, the \u03b2-\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence\nspectrum displays considerably less background than the \u03b3 -\u03b3\ncoincidence spectrum, allowing more in-depth coincidence\nanalysis despite the overall low statistics collected in this\nexperiment.\nThree of the new transitions are found to be in coincidence\nwith known transitions and also match the energy difference\nof known energy levels in 32Mg. The 1666 keV line is\nin coincidence with the 885 keV transition and fits the\nenergy difference between the known 2551 and 885 keV\nstates. Similarly, the 486 keV line is in coincidence with the\n885 keV \u03b3 ray and is placed as a 3037 to 2551 keV transition.\nFinally, the 2269 keV line is observed in coincidence with\nthe aforementioned 1666 keV transition and is assigned as a\ntransition between the 4820 and the 2551 keV states.\nA 693.4 keV \u03b3 has been seen but not placed by Guillemaud-\nMueller et al. [16]. Recently, Mach et al. assign this transition\nto 31Mg as an 11\/2\u2212 \u2192 7\/2\u2212 transition from a new level at\n1154 keV to the previously seen 461 keV level [18]. \u03b2-\u03b3 -\u03b3\ncoincidences observed in this work support the placement\nas made by Mach et al. (see Fig. 3(a)). However, the\ncoincidence spectrum also suggests another slightly higher-\nenergy line (about 695 keV) may belong in the 32Mg decay\nscheme, as the same coincidence gate produces coincidences\nwith the 885 keV (see Fig. 3(a)). As additional evidence,\nthis transition is also seen in \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences with the\n1973 keV \u03b3 ray, another known transition in 32Mg (see\nFig. 3(b)). The individual contributions of both transitions can-\nnot be extracted, thus only the intensity of the doublet state is\nreported in Table I. To explain the coincidences observed with\nthe 695 keV transition, it is proposed that it results from the\ndecay of a new level at 3553 keV to the known 2858 keV level,\nwhich subsequently decays by the sequential emission of both\nthe 1973 keV and 885 keV \u03b3 rays observed in coincidence.\nFurther evidence for the 3553 keV level exists.

The\nlatter coincidence is not possible from the decay scheme of\n32Mg proposed by Klotz et al., where the 1232 keV and the\n1436 keV transitions correspond to the decay of a 2117 keV\nand the 2321 keV states, respectively, to the first excited state in\n32Mg. At present, there is no further published evidence of the\nexistence of a 2117 keV state in 32Mg. It is therefore suggested\nthat the 2117 keV state postulated by Klotz et al. may not exist\nand that the 1232 keV transition results instead from the decay\nof the new 3553 keV state to the known 2321 keV state in\n32Mg. The observation of a feeding of the 2321 keV state from\na higher energy level is of importance as it shows that the\n\u03b2-decay to the 2321 keV state does not necessarily have to be\nan allowed transition and therefore does not restrict this state to\nbe of negative parity. No evidence of the decay of the 2321 keV\nstate to the ground state could be found in this work. Moreover,\nFIG. 4. Decay scheme in 32Mg as observed in this work. The\ndashed lines indicate the new transitions and levels. Energies are in\nkeV.\nthe 1232 keV transition is also found in coincidence with\nitself (see Fig. 3(d)), suggesting the existence of an even\nhigher excited state at 4785 keV in 32Mg. No coincidence is\nobserved with the 695 keV \u03b3 ray originating from the 3553 keV\nlevel, which could have constituted supporting evidence for the\nexistence of such a state. Figure 4 includes the new transitions\nand the new levels at 3553 keV and at (tentatively) 4785 keV.\nNo other significant (\u03b2-)\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences are observed to\nhelp in the placement of the remaining four lines identified\nas possibly belonging to the immediate \u03b2-decay scheme of\n32Na.\nThis work was partially supported by the Natural Sciences\nand Engineering Research Council of Canada and the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy through Grant\/Contract Nos.
