A \nnational survey of 1511 children and 906 parents found that 12\u201417-year-olds encounter a \nrange of online risks. Parents implement a range of strategies, favoring active co-use and \ninteraction rules over technical restrictions using filters or monitoring software, but these \nwere not necessarily effective in reducing risk. Parental restriction of online peer-to-peer \ninteractions was associated with reduced risk but other mediation strategies, including the \nwidely practiced active co-use, were not. These findings challenge researchers to identify \neffective strategies without impeding teenagers\u2019 freedom to interact with their peers online. \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     3 \nParental Mediation of Children\u2019s Internet Use \nMedia surround children and young people in the modern household. At times, \nparents seem engaged in a constant battle with their children as they seek to balance the \neducational and social advantages of media use and the negative effects that some content or \nmediated contact might have on children\u2019s attitudes, behavior, or safety. Though parents \nassume media affect other people\u2019s children more than their own (Nathanson, Eveland, Park, \n& Paul, 2002), they try to regulate their children\u2019s media use, hoping to maximize the \nadvantages of today\u2019s media-rich environment for their children and to minimize the \ndisadvantages, as examined in this article. Strategies include rule-making and restrictions, \nboth positive (e.g., explaining, discussing) and negative (e.g., disagreeing, criticizing) forms \nof mediation, and social co-viewing (Austin, 1990). Terminology varies, but the notion of \n\u201cmediation\u201d is widely seen to capture the parental management of the relation between \nchildren and media; usefully, it extends the parental role beyond simple restrictions to \nencompass also conversational and interpretive strategies (e.g., Nathanson, 1999; \nValkenburg, Krcmar, Peeters, & Marseille, 1999) as well as parental monitoring activities \n(Kerr & Stattin, 2000). However, it\u2019s noted that some use \u201cmediation\u201d more narrowly to refer \nto parental discussion without also including rule-making or co-viewing (e.g. Austin, 1990). \nAs the media and communication environment becomes increasingly difficult for \ngovernments to regulate, these hitherto private activities of parents are becoming more valued \nwithin public policy frameworks, especially those concerned with protecting children from \nmedia-related harm (Kunkel & Wilcox, 2001; Livingstone & Bober, 2006; Oswell, 2008). \nThis is, broadly, consistent with the theorization of parental mediation in terms of the family \nsystem, for on this view, parental mediation strategies represent ways in which the family \nreproduces its values in the face of external meaning systems (e.g., Goodman, 1983; Hoover, \nClark, & Alters, 2004; Livingstone, 2002). Not only do parents seek to prevent unwanted \ninfluences but also, as proposed by Warren\u2019s (2005) ecological approach to the parent-child \ninteraction proposes that parents use the media to facilitate desired values, for example, by \nusing media to support shared family activities (via co-viewing, the construction of common \ninterests, talking about media; c.f. Fujioka & Austin, 2002). This line of inquiry directs \nresearchers to the importance of family communication patterns (Ritchie & Fitzpatrick, 1990) \nor parenting styles (Eastin, Greenberg, & Hofschire, 2006). Other researchers take a socio-\ncognitive approach, regarding parental mediation as stimulating the development of \nchildren\u2019s media literacy which may, again, mitigate harmful media effects (Austin, 1993; \nKunkel & Wilcox, 2001; Nathanson, 2004). Although largely developed in parallel, these \napproaches may be considered complementary: Parental mediation both results from \nprocesses of family dynamics and child socialization and contributes to the shaping of family \nvalues, practices, and media literacy. \nIn regulating their children\u2019s media use, parents face several challenges. These include \nthe proliferation of media goods in the home, especially in children\u2019s bedrooms, and the \ngrowing complexity of media and communication technologies. Especially for new media, \nlack of technical expertise may hinder implementation of parental mediation at home (Facer, \nFurlong, Furlong, & Sutherland, 2003; Livingstone & Bober, 2006). Yet as domestic Internet \nuse becomes more commonplace, even overtaking time spent with television in some \ncountries (Lenhart, Madden, & Hitlin, 2005), the bewildering array of online content \naccessible to young people occasions concern among parents, academics and policy-makers \n(Criddle, 2006). In the United Kingdom, 75% of 9\u201419-year-olds have Internet access at \nhome (Livingstone & Bober, 2005). In the United States in 2004, 87% of 12\u201417-year-olds \nwere Internet users, and 49% have home access to broadband (Fox, 2005; see also Roberts, \nFoehr, & Rideout, 2005). Notwithstanding the growing evidence of online risks (Berson & \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     4 \nBerson, 2005; Liau, Khoo, & Ang, 2005; Livingstone & Bober, 2006; Mitchell, Finkelhor, & \nWolak, 2003; Peter & Valkenburg, 2006; Wolak, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2007), little is yet \nknown of the strategies parents employ regarding their children\u2019s Internet use, and still less is \nknown of their effectiveness (although see Eastin, et al., 2006;  Lenhart, 2005; von Feilitzen \n& Carlsson, 2004). \nIn the research literature, most attention has been paid to parental mediation of \nchildren\u2019s television use, this typically including practices designed to influence the child\u2019s \nresponse to television content through joint discussion or through simply watching together \nwith the child as well as more controlling practices designed to restrict or manage overall \ntime spent watching television or the particular programs viewed (Austin, 1993; Van den \nBulck & Van den Bergh, 2000). The use of various rules and practices varies according to the \nchild\u2019s gender (more for girls) and age (more for younger children) as well as, in some \nresearch, parenting style (Eastin, et al., 2006) and household socio-economic status (SES) \n(Nathanson, 2001b; Warren, 2005). \nNathanson (1999, 2001a) draws together the research literature by proposing three \nbroad strategies of parental regulation, namely active, restrictive, and co-viewing mediation. \nValkenburg et al. (1999) similarly group mediation strategies for television into the categories \nof active or instructive mediation, rule making or restrictive mediation, and parental modeling \nor co-viewing (van der Voort et al., 1992). These strategies may be stated in a more general \nform to apply to all media: (1) Active mediation consists of talking about media content while \nthe child is engaging with (watching, reading, listening to) the medium (hence, this includes \nboth positive\/instructional and negative\/critical forms of mediation); (2) Restrictive mediation \ninvolves setting rules that restrict use of the medium, including restrictions on time spent, \nlocation of use or content (e.g., restricting exposure to violent or sexual content), without \nnecessarily discussing the meaning or effects of such content; (3) Co-using signifies that the \nparent remains present while the child is engaged with the medium (as for co-viewing), thus \nsharing in the experience but without commenting on the content or its effects. \nDo parents employ similar mediation strategies for the Internet? It is noteworthy that \nin relation to parental mediation of video games, three similar types of strategies have been \nfound\u2014\u201crestrictive mediation\u201d, \u201cactive mediation\u201d and \u201cco-playing\u201d (Nikken & Jansz, 2006). \nHence, it is possible that parents will apply familiar strategies to the Internet also, thus \nshowing consistency in their parenting approach. On the other hand, it is also possible that \nthey will seek new strategies, given the highly publicized array of online risks. Moreover, by \ncomparison with television (and even video games), it is difficult to make Internet use a \nshared activity (because of screen size, sitting position, reliance on the mouse, and common \nlocation in a small or private room). Also, online activities are less easily monitored with a \ncasual glance at the screen, given multitasking across multiple open windows. Most \nimportant, online risks to children are greater than are television-related risks (regarding the \nextremes of violent or pornographic content, privacy or contact risks from strangers, etc), \ngiving rise in turn to greater anxieties among parents (Wolak, et al., 2007; Peter & \nValkenburg, 2006). Hence the first research question is: \nRQ1: What strategies of mediation, if any, do parents practice in regulating their \nchildren\u2019s Internet use? \nAddressing this question should reveal the degree to which parents use similar \nmediation strategies to those developed for television for their child\u2019s use of the Internet and \nwhether, given the difficulties of monitoring and the limitations of parental expertise, they \nprefer restrictive to active mediation or co-use strategies of mediation. Although the literature \nto date does not bear the construction of specific hypotheses, the measures used (see below) \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     5 \nwere designed, within practical limits, to cover the range of likely strategies, drawing on both \nthe television mediation literature and widespread guidelines to parents (e.g., Criddle, 2006). \nSince research on television mediation shows few differences by child\u2019s gender but greater \nmediation for younger children, it is expected to find this pattern also for Internet mediation. \nIs parental mediation effective? In relation to television, this question has not proved \nstraightforward to answer. However, it can be concluded that different strategies of parental \nregulation of television have varying effects (Austin, 1990; Nathanson, 1999; van der Voort, \net al., 1992). Active mediation can have socially desirable consequences, leading children to \nbecome more skeptical towards television content and more knowledgeable about its \nproduction (Nathanson, 2001a) as well as reducing the likelihood of behavior or attitudes that \nmight damage others (e.g., violence or racism; Nathanson, 1999). Co-viewing has been \nshown to be as or even more effective, but only in some not all circumstances (Messaris & \nKerr, 1984; Nathanson, 1999). Restrictive mediation varies in effectiveness depending on the \ndegree of restriction applied (Nathanson et al., 2002), though some suggest that restrictive \ntelevision regulation does reduce risks, albeit by dint of reducing media use overall (Van den \nBulck & Van den Bergh, 2000).  \nResearch on parental mediation of children\u2019s Internet use is now beginning to \nconsider the effectiveness of parental strategies. It seems that parents hope that restricting \nteenagers\u2019 Internet use will reduce online risky experiences (Turow & Nir, 2000). Berson and \nBerson (2005) found that if parents talk to their teenage daughters, this reduced the likelihood \nof contact risks; by implication, a positive parental attitude to sharing and supporting their \nchild\u2019s Internet use may enhance take-up of online opportunities (Facer, et al., 2003), \nalthough Jackson et al. (2006) did not find parental support to encourage Internet use. \nHowever, Mitchell, et al. (2003) found that software restrictions rather than parental \nmonitoring reduced risks. Further investigation is clearly needed, and hence the second \nresearch question is: \nRQ2: Is parental mediation associated with a reduction in teenagers\u2019 online risks? \nThis question will be addressed both by examining the association between the overall \ndegree of parental mediation implemented and also by examining the association between \ndifferent types of risk and different types of mediation. As noted above, it is widely hoped \nthat increasing parental mediation will reduce the incidence of risks online, although this has \nnot been clearly and convincingly demonstrated as yet. Moreover, many factors may enter \ninto the relationship between mediation and online risks, including child\u2019s expertise online \nand parental expertise. \nThe approach here is exploratory, for research regarding which parents adopt different \nforms of mediation or which children encounter different risks online remains sparse. \nQuestions of frequency of use, attitudes towards technology, and skills associated with use, \nwhich seem of little relevance in mediating television, are popularly supposed to influence \nboth children\u2019s risky experiences online and parental competence in framing rules and \nregulations. Whether parents wish to encourage or discourage their children\u2019s Internet use \nmight also play a role, though little is yet known of their attitudes towards the Internet \n(although see Livingstone, 2007; Turow & Nir, 2000). In what follows, these possibilities will \nbe examined. \nMethod \nSurvey Sample and Recruitment \nA national survey was conducted through an in-home, 40-minute face-to-face \ninterview with children and young people aged 9\u201419, using random location sampling across \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     6 \nthe United Kingdom. Following the design and piloting of the survey questionnaire by the \nresearch team, fieldwork was carried out between January and March 2004 using multimedia \ncomputer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) with children. A self-completion \nquestionnaire was given to one parent of the 9\u201417-year-olds. Sensitive questions in the \nyoung people\u2019s questionnaire (e.g., those relating to viewing pornographic and hate Web sites \nor meeting people through the Internet) were administered in a self-completion section to \nensure privacy. In total, 1,511 interviews with 9\u201419-year-olds were completed. Further, \n1077 parents of children aged 9\u201417 agreed to complete the questionnaire; of these, 920 \npaper questionnaires were received and 906 were usable. Percentages were weighted to data \nin the British Market Research Bureau\u2019s Target Group Index and Youth surveys. The \nweighting efficiency was 91% and the effective sample size was 1375. Raw sample sizes and \nstatistical analyses are based on unweighted data. \nQuestions about online risks and parental mediation were asked of the 84% of the \nchildren who used the Internet at least once per week. This article analyzes data for 12- to 17-\nyear-olds (N=879), these comprising 605 12\u201415-year-olds and 274 16\u201417-year-olds; 478 \nwere boys and 401 were girls; the sample also varied by socioeconomic status (402 middle \nclass, 477 working class).2 For the parent sample (N=631; 382 18\u201444-year-olds, 219 44\u2014\n65+-year-olds, and 30 did not give their age; 447 mothers, 174 fathers, and 10 unspecified). \nInformed consent was obtained from all teenagers and parents. Questions asked of both \nparents and children are distinguished in the analysis as either \u201cchild\u2019s view\u201d or \u201cparent\u2019s \nview.\u201d  Many of the items used, below, are similar to those used in previous research (on \ntelevision mediation, on Internet use; some parallel those asked in the European Safety \nAwareness Facts and Tools (SAFT) project; Staksrud, 2005). \nSurvey Measures \nFrequency of Use. This was measured, for parents and children, as responses to the \nquestion, \u201cHow often do you use the Internet?\u201d on an 8-point scale: 1 (never) and 8 (several \ntimes per day). \nNature of Use. The child was asked how often they used the Internet for sending and \nreceiving e-mails, chatrooms, instant messaging, playing games online, looking for products \nor shopping online, and downloading music (frequencies were converted into dichotomous \nvariables by distinguishing those who had \u2018never\u2019 done the activity from those who had done \nthe activity between \u2018less than monthly\u2019 and \u2018several times per day\u2019). \nSkills (perceived). This measured, for parents and children, as the response to the \nquestion, \u201cWhich of the following are you good at?\u201d The scale measured how many of seven \nInternet-related activities respondents said they were good at (Cronbach\u2019s a = 0.71 for \nteenagers; 0.82 for parents). \nAttitudes. Using a 5-point Likert-type scale, parents rated how much they agreed with \n14 statements about the Internet (measuring both positive and negative attitudes towards the \neffects of Internet use on children). Responses were combined to create a scale of 1 (very \nnegative attitude toward the Internet) to 5 (very positive attitude toward the internet); \nCronbach\u2019s a = 0.59. \nParental Mediation. Parents and children reported, using a binary response, which \nincluded a list of rules and practices used by parents (see Table 1 for response items). A \ncomposite scale was constructed for the different types of rules and practices implemented by \nparents (range 0\u201424; Cronbach\u2019s a for parents\u2019 responses = 0.88, for teenagers\u2019 responses = \n0.67), and a factor analysis conducted to identify subscales (reported under Results). \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     7 \nRisks. Parents and children reported, using a binary response, whether \u201cyou\/ your \nchild has done these things on the Internet?\u201d A composite scale recorded the number of risks \nencountered (for teenagers\u2019 responses, the range was 0\u201415, a = 0.76; for parents\u2019 responses, \nthe range was 0\u201410, a = 0.78). Since risks vary in nature, they were subdivided into four \ncategories, consistent with the research literature and supported by a factor analysis. The \nfindings reveal the percentages of 12\u201417-year-olds, who use the Internet at least once a week \n(N=789), who reported having experienced each risk: pornographic (seen pop-up \nadvertisements for pornography while doing something else\u201444%, ended up on a porn site \naccidentally when looking for something else\u201441%, received pornographic junk mail\u201428%, \nhave been sent pornography from someone they know\u20149%; visited a porn site on purpose\u2014\n9%, and have been sent porn from someone met online\u20143%); violence (have accidentally \nended up on a site with violent or gruesome pictures\u201427%,  visited such a site on purpose\u2014\n14%; ended up accidentally on a site that was hostile or hateful to a group of people\u201410%, \nand visited such a site on purpose\u20143%); privacy (have given out personal information \nonline\u201446%, would do this to win a prize in a quiz\u201472%); and contact risks (know \nsomeone that they only talk to online\u201436%, have met face-to-face someone first met \nonline\u20149%, have received nasty or hurtful comments online\u201433%). \nIn addition, the survey included further questions regarding Internet use and non-use; \nbasic findings, by demographics, are reported in detail in Livingstone & Bober (2005). \nResults and Discussion \nRQ1: Strategies of Parental Mediation of the Internet \nParents attempt a fair degree of regulation for teenagers (Table 1), unsurprising given \nthe above noted incidence of online risk (though they tend to perceive a lower level of risk \nthan reported by children; Livingstone & Bober, 2006). On average, parents sought to \nimplement 7 or 8 out of 24 different kinds of mediation. These were first combined into a \nsingle composite scale for parental mediation (Cronbach\u2019s a = 0.88) so as to conduct analyses \nof variance to determine the effect of socio demographic factors. These showed that, as \nexpected, age is important: Parents implemented significantly more rules and regulations for \nyounger than older teens, F(1,634) = 18.43,  p <0.01. However, there were no significant \ndifferences in the regulation of sons and daughters, F(1,634) = 0.01,  p = 0.98. \nSocioeconomic status made a difference: Higher SES parents implemented more rules and \npractices F(1,634) = 28.34,  p <0.01), possibly reflecting middle class parents\u2019 greater \nfamiliarity with the Internet (see below). \n---Insert Table 1 about here--- \nDo parental strategies for Internet use match those already practiced for television? \nThough data were not collected for the mediation of television in this study, a meaningful \ncomparison was sought by entering the items in Table 1 into an exploratory factor analysis. \nThis revealed four factors which were labeled as follows: active co-use, interaction \nrestrictions, technical restrictions, and monitoring (see Table 1). The correlations between the \nfour mediation styles ranged from 0.30 (between interaction restrictions and monitoring) to \n0.63 (between active co-use and interaction restrictions). These mediation styles share some \nfeatures with those previously identified for television viewing, while also revealing some \ndifferences that suggest parents are adapting existing strategies to meet the new challenge \nposed by the Internet.  \nThe factor labeled active co-use combines activities that, for television, are generally \ndistinguished as either active\/evaluative or co-use. Although Eastin, et al. (2006) reproduced \nthe distinction between parental \u201cco-viewing\u201d and \u201cinterpretive\u201d mediation for children\u2019s use \nof Web sites, their integration in the present study is readily interpretable, pointing to the \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     8 \ndifferent contexts in which television and the Internet are used. Parents and children may \nwatch television together with little conversation (i.e., co-use), perhaps with the parent also \nreading the paper while the child does their homework in front of the screen. However, to sit \ntogether in front of the computer while the child goes online, or even to be in the same room, \nmakes co-use more active, for conversation about the online activity, including interpretive or \nevaluative comments or guidance, is more likely. Such active co-use also, according to the \nfactor analysis, includes restricting the child in relation to personal information, buying online \nor completing forms and quizzes, perhaps through such rules as, \u201cyou may only do X when I \nam with you.\u201d Future qualitative research could usefully examine the emerging social norms \nand practices regarding co-use of the Internet in the family context. \nA second difference from television mediation is that parents may implement both \nsocial rules (banning or restricting activities) and technical restrictions (filtering or blocking \ncertain activities). These were clearly distinguished in the factor analysis, unsurprisingly since \ninteractivity is integral to the Internet but not (yet) to television. McMillan (2006) \ndistinguishes user-system interactivity (e.g., games, shopping, voting), user-documents \ninteractivity (e.g., searching) and user-user interactivity (e.g., chat, e-mail, peer-to-peer \nnetworking). These are associated, in reality and as perceived by parents, with different forms \nand degrees of risk. Thus, the active co-use factor included restrictions on user-system \ninteractivity (as noted above, such restrictions may be explained and enforced during parent-\nchild co-use). User-user (or peer-to-peer) interactivity was subject to a distinct set of \nrestrictions, being the object of considerable parental anxieties. This second factor was \nlabeled interaction restrictions; here, e-mail, chat, and instant messaging are banned, along \nwith game playing (possibly peer-to-peer games) and downloading (another problematic \nactivity much in the public eye). \nThe use of technical restrictions represents a third factor, this being applied variously \nto diverse forms of risky activity, and is one of two forms of parental mediation unique to the \nInternet (Eastin et al., 2006). The fourth factor, also Internet-specific, is parental monitoring \nor checking up on the child\u2019s activity, covertly or overtly, after use. Considerable public \nsafety advice has recommended such monitoring to parents as a non-intrusive strategy; only \nmore recently has this attracted criticism as a potential infringement of children\u2019s privacy \n(Livingstone & Bober, 2006). \nActive co-use was fairly widespread: Two thirds of parents talk to their child about \nInternet use, nearly half watch the screen, and one third stay nearby when their child is online. \nFurther, a sizeable minority of parents apply various interaction restrictions, banning their \nchildren from using e-mail (43%), downloading (17%), or using chat rooms (13%). Technical \nrestrictions were also implemented by a fair minority, including 33% with filtering software \ninstalled and 23% with monitoring software; however, 20% did not know or were not sure \nwhether a filter was installed, suggesting some limitations on parental skill. Last, some \nmonitor the computer after the child has finished using it, with 30% checking sites visited and \n17% checking e-mails. Active co-use is, it seems, the favored strategy among parents, though \nrestricting teenagers\u2019 activities is also common. \nThese conclusions, and the classification of mediation strategies, merit further \nresearch, especially given the considerable public policy effort seeking to formulate and \ndisseminate parental guidance and safety advice. However, there are some limitations to the \npresent research. The factor loadings were not entirely consistent with the above \ninterpretation (e.g., \u201csit with your child and go online together\u201d loaded higher on interaction \nrestrictions than on active co-use); however, as the alphas calculated for the scales as \ninterpreted above (shaded in gray in Table 1) closely resembled those calculated for scales \nbased on all items whose loadings exceeded 0.3, the former factor structure was selected, the \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     9 \nsubscales being more interpretable and statistically independent. It is also noted that the \nselection of items was not sufficiently fine-grained to distinguish positive from negative \nmediation, again a valuable topic for future research. \nRQ2: Relating Parental Mediation to Children\u2019s Online Risk \nOne way of addressing this question is to compare the incidence of a specific activity \nas reported by the child and the existence of a parental rule that bans it. The survey included \nquestions regarding the incidence of several online activities that, in the present context, may \nbe considered potentially risky forms of interactivity; certainly they are regarded in this way \nby some parents, for banning them is included in two forms of mediation: active co-use and \ninteraction restrictions. Nine of these risky activities could be matched to specific parental \nbans (as shown in Table 1, these bans were associated with both active co-use and interaction \nrestrictions). Table 2 shows the correlations between the likelihood of each activity and the \npresence of a ban on that same activity, as perceived by both children and parents. These \nsuggest that instituting such a ban is broadly effective.  \n---Insert Table 2 about here --- \nThe noteworthy exception is that for giving out personal information online. Parental \nbans, as perceived by the parent, were associated with a greater not lesser likelihood of the \nchild giving out such information. One possibility here is that parents ban (or, become aware \nof banning) divulging personal information after, not before they discover their child to have \ndone such a thing. Indeed, whether parental regulation is instituted before or after the fact (i.e. \nin response to the anticipated or actual experience of online risk) is worthy of further \ninvestigation. Beyond this exception, the application of restrictive rules correlated negatively \nwith the risk activity to which they referred. Taking the child\u2019s view of the presence of a rule, \nthis was the case for all activities. Taking the parent\u2019s view, this was the case for all except \nbuying, and filling out forms and quizzes. \nThese exceptions (that is buying, and filling out forms and quizzes) are worthy of an \nexplanation. Note that they are cases of user-system rather than user-user interaction, in \nMcMillan\u2019s (2006) terms, and that rules restricting them were classified earlier under active \nco-use rather than interaction restrictions (which focused on user-user interaction). Two \nalternatives are possible. First, it may be that parents think they have restricted these activities \nthrough conversations held when sitting with or otherwise sharing the online experience with \ntheir child, though the child may not recognize this and so still engage in user-system \nactivities. Second, it may be that if warned about user-system interactivity, teenagers see this \nas relatively unimportant by contrast with warnings about peer-to-peer interaction (here \nparental warnings are supported by considerable media publicity). It may also be the case, of \ncourse, that parents overestimate the degree to which they mediate their children\u2019s Internet \nuse, especially given the social desirability of appearing to regulate when asked by a \nresearcher. Whichever is the case, it appears that whether children themselves recognize a \nrule to be in place matters more than the parents\u2019 view that they have issued such a \nprohibition (c.f. Fujioka & Austin, 2003; Nathanson, 2001a). Further qualitative research on \nhow children actually interpret parental guidance would be helpful. \nSince both rules and risks are stratified by the child\u2019s age, gender, and social class, the \npossibility remains that the correlation between risky activities and a ban on these is due to a \nthird factor\u2014child\u2019s age or class, for instance. Or, as suggested earlier, more expert parents, \nor parents more positive about the Internet, may implement more rules or active co-use and so \nhave children who more successfully avoid risks. In pursuing RQ2, the researchers return to \nthe longer list of rules and risks initiated in order to ask, Can teenagers\u2019 experience of online \nrisks be predicted according to the combined influence of child\/parent characteristics and \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     10 \nmediation practices? These questions were addressed statistically in two stages, in order first \nto examine the predictors of parental mediation (in terms of characteristics of the parent and \nchild) and then, second, to examine whether parental mediation, taking into account these \ncharacteristics of parent and child, together account for the risks teenagers encounter online. \nIn understanding how mediation might influence online risk taking by the child, it is \nimportant to control for the effect of other variables that might be related to both online risk \ntaking and parental mediation. Earlier research shows that age, gender, skills, and experience \nall influence a child\u2019s risk taking. It is likely that similar characteristics are related to the \nparent\u2019s mediation style and that a parent\u2019s characteristics have a similar influence. To \nunderstand the independent effect of mediation, further analyses control for and discuss the \neffects of these other variables.  \nFirst, multivariate linear regressions were conducted to determine whether child and \nparent characteristics account for the degree of parental mediation. These regressions were \nrepeated using both the composite scale for parental mediation as perceived by the parent and \nthe composite scale as perceived by the child. This showed that the only child characteristic \nthat influenced parental mediation (according to the parent), was the child\u2019s age: Parents saw \nthemselves as mediating their child\u2019s Internet use less as the child gets older (Table 3). \nAdditionally, parental frequency of Internet use and level of skill also mattered: Parents who \nused the Internet more, or who claimed more skills in using it, were more likely to mediate \ntheir child\u2019s use. \nThe parallel analysis for parental mediation according to the child produced very \nsimilar results. As for parents, age matters, with older teenagers perceiving themselves to \nreceive less parental mediation. Gender matters too, with girls perceiving themselves to \nreceive more mediation than do boys (though parents did not perceive a gender difference in \ntheir approach). As before, more Internet-skilled parents were more active mediators of their \nchild\u2019s Internet use. There is no evidence that parental mediation varies by socioeconomic \nstatus or according to parental attitudes (positive or negative) to the Internet. Nor does it \nappear to depend on the child\u2019s own level of perceived online skills. Rather, parental \nperceptions of the child\u2019s overall maturity (i.e., their understanding of the significance of age) \nare crucial. Also important are parents\u2019 own experience of and perceived skills with the \nInternet, this presumably giving them the knowledge and\/or confidence to mediate and a \nclearer awareness of the risks that can be encountered online.  \n---Insert Table 3 about here--- \nSecond, hierarchical linear regressions were used to explain online risks (according to \nthe child\u2019s view), to determine whether these are influenced by parental mediation (parent\u2019s \nview and child\u2019s view) when controlling for characteristics of the child and parent. First, the \nchild characteristics (age, gender, frequency of Internet use, online skills) were entered into \nthe equation to explain online risk (child\u2019s view). Second, the characteristics of the parent \n(socioeconomic status, frequency of Internet use, online skills, attitudes to the Internet) were \nentered. Last, parental mediation (both parent\u2019s view and child\u2019s view) was entered to see if it \ncould add to the variance explained in online risk. Given the complexity of this equation, the \noverall scale for parental mediation was used (though, as presented below, this proved \nunhelpful, necessitating a reanalysis based on the four strategies of parental mediation). The \nregression was, further, conducted both for all risks and also repeated for each of the four \ncategories of risk. \nAs an explanation of overall online risk encountered by teenagers, the first block of \nvariables (child\u2019s characteristics) explained 28% of the variance F(1,560) = 54.39, p <0.001). \nWhen each type of risk was examined separately, the findings were that: For violent risks, \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     11 \nonly 8% of the variance was explained by the child\u2019s characteristics F(4,560) = 12.85, p \n<0.001); for pornographic risks, 13% of the variance was explained F(4,560) = 20.70, p \n<0.001); for privacy risks, 8% of the variance was explained F(4,560) = 12.82, p <0.001); and \nfor contact risks, 19% of the variance was explained F(4,560) = 32.24, p <0.001). For each of \nthese regressions, neither of the two subsequent blocks (parent characteristics and parental \nmediation) significantly increased the variance explained. \nThus, it is the characteristics of the child that matters in accounting for the incidence \nof online risks, for both overall risk and for each category of risk. Specifically, age (older), \ngender (boys), and online skills (more) are all predictors of online risk. Characteristics of the \nparent did not add significantly to the explanation of online risk. Crucially, nor did parental \nmediation. Thus, while certain parents (e.g., those more experienced in Internet use) \nimplement more mediation, this does not translate into risk reduction. Nor does more parental \nmediation mean less risk or vice versa. This relative ineffectiveness of parental mediation in \nreducing risks is consistent with other recent research on children\u2019s Internet use (Liau, et al. \n2005; Mitchell et al., 2003). Liau et al. note the relations among risky behaviors (e.g., those \nwho give out personal information online are also more likely to meet online friends offline; \nLivingstone & Helsper, 2007), suggesting that successful interventions for one kind of \nbehavior, once identified, may have wider benefits. Before concluding that there is no \nexplanatory role for parental mediation in relation to teens\u2019 online risk, one should consider \nthe detailed relations among child and parent characteristics, parental mediation, and online \nrisk (see Table 4), as revealed by these regression analyses. This reveals several significant \nfindings of interest. \n---Insert Table 4 about here--- \nFirst, the findings in Table 4 qualify the earlier finding that older teenagers, especially \nboys, and those who are more skilled, are significantly more likely to encounter risk. By \nseparating findings for different types of risk, Table 4 suggests that there is a relation between \nage and pornographic and privacy risks, but not between age and violent or contact risks \n(contrary to the popular view that younger teens encounter more such risks). It also suggests \nthat the relation between gender and risks holds for all risks except privacy risks (contrary to \nthe popular view that girls encounter more such risks). \nIt is further noted that the positive association between children\u2019s perceived online \nskills and online risk is thought-provoking, for children can be expected to become more \nexpert online in the coming years. This finding contradicts any easy assumption that as \nteenagers become more expert, they will get better at avoiding online risks. \nThird, Table 4 shows that parents who use the Internet less have children who \nencounter more contact risks, controlling for characteristics of the child. This may, perhaps, \nprovide a pointer towards explaining the general apparent ineffectiveness of active co-use, \nsuggesting a general issue concerning parental inexperience with the Internet (especially \ncompared with their critical television literacy)\u2014indeed, their active co-use may possibly \nexacerbate as much as resolve problems of use; certainly it does not appear to ameliorate \nthem.  \nLast, and consistent with the earlier reported finding regarding the link between \ninteraction restrictions and the corresponding online activity, it seems that instituting \ninteraction restrictions (as perceived by parents, this including a ban on e-mail, chat rooms, \ninstant messaging, online games, and downloading) predict a lower level of overall risk \nonline. Although this was not specifically a means of reducing privacy or contact risks, as \nmight have been expected from a banning of user-user interactions, it is nonetheless \nencouraging for the attempt to reduce teenagers\u2019 online risks. \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     12 \nConclusions \nContrary to the hopes of policy makers and parents, getting parental regulation of the \nInternet right, so that children and teenagers understand it and, more important, so that the \nsupposed harmful consequences of certain online activities are actually reduced, is proving \ndifficult. The present findings have shown that teenagers are encountering a range of online \nrisks. Parents, consequently, are attempting a range of mediation strategies, these partly \ndrawing on but also adapting the strategies long developed for television. Parents have a \npreference for social over technical forms of mediation, preferring active co-use over \ntechnical restrictions and monitoring practices (see Table 1).2\nHowever, the expectation that increasing mediation would reduce risks was not \nsupported, as has been found also for parental control and monitoring of other areas of risk in \nadolescence (Kerr & Stattin, 2000). The exception, however, was that a significant reduction \nin online risks was found to be associated with the parental restriction of user-user interaction. \nThe role of those other users (in peer-to-peer interaction) suggests a line of inquiry for future \nresearch: Writing about television, Nathanson (2001a) reports that while parental mediation \ncan inhibit negative effects, peer mediation may facilitate them. Neither active co-use, though \nwidely practiced, nor software-based strategies (filtering and monitoring) were found to be \neffective in reducing risk, challenging future research to identify the benefits, if any, of such \npractices. Further, although it is encouraging that restricting online interactions has some \nbenefits, the costs in terms of reducing teenagers\u2019 freedom to interact with peers online must \nbe weighed against the advantages in developing safety guidance directed at parents and \nteenagers. For teenagers, after all, e-mail, chat, instant messaging, games, downloading are \namong the benefits of the Internet, so that restricting them keeps teenagers safer at a cost. \nIn order to understand the conditions of risk in relation to children\u2019s use of the \nInternet, and so as to advise policy makers and parents, further research addressing the \nquestions raised and findings presented in this article is needed. The simple assumption that \nintroducing forms of parental mediation will reduce the risks young people encounter online, \nespecially while protecting their opportunities, is misguided. Moreover, learning the lessons \nof parental mediation of television provides a useful starting point but this is insufficient, for \nthe Internet poses some very specific challenges, both regarding the nature of risk and for \nthose seeking to protect children and young people while supporting their online activities \nmore generally. \n \nLivingstone and Helsper\/ Parental Mediation Of Children\u2019s Internet Use     13 \nNotes \n1 Social class is measured according to the standard market research categories: A \u2013 Upper \nmiddle class (Higher managerial administrative or professional occupations, top level civil \nservants), B \u2013 Middle class (Intermediate managerial administrative or professional people, \nsenior officers in local government and civil service), C1 \u2013 Lower middle class (Supervisory \nor clerical and junior managerial administrative or professional occupations), C2 \u2013 Skilled \nworking class (Skilled manual workers), D \u2013 Working class (Semi and unskilled manual \nworkers), E \u2013 Those at lowest levels of subsistence (All those entirely dependent on the State \nlong term, casual workers, those without regular income).
