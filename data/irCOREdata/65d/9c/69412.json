POOLEY\nLancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YQ\nLiverpool\u2019s designation as European Capital of Culture for 2008, together\nwith the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough in 2007, has\n(unsurprisingly) generated a number of books dealing with different\naspects of the city\u2019s history. The five volumes reviewed here represent\njust a small selection of those available, ranging from the deliberately\nacademic to much more popular publications. Together they provide much\nof interest for urban historians. If these books have a common theme\nit is the argument (or assumption) that for much of its history, and in\nmany different respects, Liverpool was (and remains) in various ways\ndifferent from other British cities. The celebration of difference lies very\nmuch at the heart of Liverpool\u2019s Capital of Culture activities, and these\nbooks provide additional perspectives on Liverpool\u2019s demographic, social,\ncultural, sporting and architectural distinctiveness.\nLiverpool, 1660\u20131750 is the product of a detailed research project at the\nUniversity of Liverpool, directed by Michael Power who sadly died before\nthe publication of this volume. It is an important book. There are very\nfew comprehensive demographic studies of large British cities and this\nvolume is a significant contribution to the literature. Chapter 1 provides\nuseful context for the demographic analysis that follows but it would\nhave been helpful if there had been more attempt to compare Liverpool to\nother places. Chapter 2 gets right to the heart of the study. It is a detailed\nand painstaking reconstruction of Liverpool\u2019s demographic history using\nfamily reconstitution from parish registers. Having outlined some of the\nproblems of dealing with such sources, the authors examine aspects of\nmortality, fertility and migration, emphasizing the high infant mortality\n(especially amongst mariners\u2019 families) and also stressing the problems of\n\u2217 Diana E.

Chapter 3\nfocuses on the occupational structure of Liverpool, 1660\u20131750, but the\nsmall sample size limits analysis and leads to mostly fairly obvious\ngeneralizations, though the individual case studies are valuable. Chapter 4\nlinks an analysis of wills to the family reconstitution data to examine\npatterns of inheritance. Again, it was the individual case studies that\nI found most telling as the data are too fragile to allow meaningful\ngeneralizations, though the authors clearly demonstrate the importance\nof wealth preservation down the social scale, and the variety of strategies\nused. Chapters 5 and 6 focus mainly on city governance and local politics,\nexamining who ran the city (with councillors drawn quite widely from\nacross the social scale) and the importance of political consensus based on\na shared commitment to the overriding importance of trade. In some ways\nthese chapters sit a little uneasily within a book where the main emphasis\nis demographic. Clearly this was a problematic project, which dealt with\ndifficult and disparate sources and encountered serious disruption of the\nresearch and writing. At times the authors struggle to craft a coherent and\nfully analytical story out of their material, focusing more on description\nthan interpretation, but it is (and is likely to remain for some considerable\ntime) the definitive study of Liverpool\u2019s early demography and the authors\nare to be congratulated for bringing this important and difficult material\nto publication.\nOf the two books by John Belchem, Merseypride is a second edition (with\na new introduction) of a book first published in 2000 and extensively\nreviewed then. The core of the book provides a useful collection of essays\n(some previously published elsewhere) on Liverpool culture and identity,\nwhile the new introduction sets these within the context of Liverpool\u2019s\nurban renaissance centred on its status as city of culture. The new edition\nshould help to bring the essays to a wider audience. However, Irish, Catholic\nand Scouse is a much more original and important volume. This is the\nproduct of extensive research on the Irish in Liverpool, conducted over\nmany years, and is a particularly valuable addition to the literature. The\nbook is divided into two historical time periods, 1800\u20131914 and 1914\u201339,\nand begins with an analysis of the position of Liverpool\u2019s Irish population\nwithin the labour market. Belchem emphasizes that not all Irish were\nunskilled, and by focusing on key individuals highlights the role of\nIrish workers within the labour movement. Chapter 2 is entitled \u2018spatial\ndimensions\u2019 and, from the perspective of an historical geographer, is\nprobably the weakest chapter. Although outlining the residential structure\nof the Irish, and relating this to their labour market characteristics, the\nchapter lacks detail (for instance there are no maps) and fails to bring\nout sufficiently clearly the extent to which some Irish were found in\nall parts of the city. The main strength of the book is in its focus on\nthe construction of Catholic Irish identities, and the use of detailed case\nstudies and vignettes to illuminate this. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on different\nLiverpool: past, present and future 499\nsets of networks that supported Liverpool Irish identities including the\nrole of the Catholic church, charities and community-based activities\n(chapter 3) and through more strongly sectarian organizations including\nFriendly Societies and Ribbonism. Belchem demonstrates the ways in\nwhich such organizations combined political, cultural and social support\nnetworks within the Catholic Irish community in Liverpool, whilst at the\nsame time helping to construct anti-Irish\/Catholic views from within the\nEnglish establishment. Chapters 5 and 6 focus directly on the political\ndimension, examining the role of sectarian politics within Liverpool.\nChapter 5 demonstrates how Irish, British and Liverpool political\nambitions often intersected in the context of Home Rule, while chapter\n6 provides a detailed account of Fenian activities in Liverpool in the 1860s,\nfocusing on links to Irish-American activism. In both these chapters the\nauthor assumes quite a high level of prior knowledge by the reader and, in\nplaces, some of the argument could have benefited from fuller elucidation.\nChapter 7 examines the product of sectarianism as seen through street\nviolence, especially in the early twentieth century. Belchem links such\nactivities back to the Liverpool labour movement and the 1911 dock\nstrike and, as elsewhere in the book, he provides a wealth of fascinating\ndetail. Chapters 8 and 9 move from sectarian politics and violence in\nLiverpool to Catholic associations and leisure pursuits. Here, Belchem\nargues that, despite many attempts to establish it, there was never a strong,\nseparate, Irish leisure and associational culture within Liverpool. The last\nthree chapters of the book focus on the period 1914\u201339, examining the\nrole of the Irish in World War I, the political and cultural impact of the Irish\nrevolution on Liverpool and the effects of the depression. In comparison\nto the nineteenth century, this period is dealt with rather briefly and, by\nconcentrating on key events, there is little attempt to situate the Liverpool\nIrish community within broader social trends in the twentieth century\n(and there is little consideration of second wave Irish migration). Overall,\nhowever, the book is very successful. It covers a wide range of material\nencompassing a great deal of original research, it is engagingly written and\nhas a convincing combination of statistical information, detailed vignettes\nand socio-cultural interpretation. The book is stronger on the cultural and\nliterary interpretations than on statistical analysis, and there remains scope\nfurther to integrate statistical data with archival sources, but this volume\nis likely to be a major source of reference and inspiration for researchers\nworking on the Irish in Liverpool and elsewhere for many years to come.\nWhile the first three books reviewed are aimed mainly at academic\naudiences, the last two have much more general appeal. Played in Liverpool\nby Ray Physick, published by English Heritage, provides a beautifully\nillustrated history of sport and recreation in Liverpool, focusing mainly\non the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Following an introductory\nessay on the history of recreation in the city, the book focuses on over 50\nsports-related sites of historical or architectural interest. The main body\n500 Urban History\nof the book is divided into three sections: the first deals with major sites\nof sport and leisure (Aintree, the Mersey, Stanley Park, etc.); the second\nfocuses on areas of sporting innovation where Liverpool entrepreneurs\nhave had a particular impact (billiards, goal nets and football pools); and\nthe third examines both a selection of stadiums and grounds and a range\nof activities including cricket, bowls, golf and many others. The author\nhas drawn together an impressive array of illustrations and matches these\nwith an accessible text which provides a fascinating insight into aspects\nof organized leisure on Merseyside and, especially, the legacy that it has\nleft on the modern townscape. Some readers will no doubt feel that their\nparticular sporting activities have not been fully covered \u2013 and as a former\nmember of Liverpool Harriers I would have liked to see more on the\nLiverpool athletics scene \u2013 but the focus of the book is very much on the\nsporting and leisure artefacts that have survived to the present and the\nselection presented provides an excellent introduction to this relatively\nneglected aspect of the cityscape.\nThe final volume is hardly new. This edition was published in 2004\nand is based on the 1969 Pevsner architectural guide to South Lancashire.\nNevertheless it is an excellent way to conclude this review. Joseph Sharples\nhas done a magnificent job of expanding and updating the Liverpool\nmaterial for this edition and the book provides the definitive guide to\narchitecture in the city. A very clearly constructed historical introduction\nis followed by sections on the major buildings of the city (for instance\nthe Town Hall and cathedrals) and on the dock architecture. Subsequent\nsections deal with different geographical districts, moving from the inner\ncity to Speke and Birkenhead. Each entry provides a wealth of information,\nall clearly presented and with excellent illustrations. Anyone interested in\nthe buildings of Liverpool will find the volume indispensable.\nAs this review has demonstrated, all five of these volumes have many\nindividual merits, but do they tell us anything collectively about the\nurban history of Liverpool? It is clear that many authors and publishers\nhave capitalized on the publicity associated with Capital of Culture;\nthis expansion of publishing on Liverpool history, life and culture is to\nbe welcomed but do the works add anything beyond their particular\ncontents? For me, when reading all five of these volumes together, what\ncomes through most strongly is the importance of linking social and\ncultural histories of the city to the physical fabric that remains visible\ntoday. The more academic books by Ascott et al. and Belchem tell us much\nabout Liverpool population, culture and society in the past, but do little\nto relate that to the present-day city. As such they are likely to remain\nlargely the preserve of those with a more academic historical interest\nin the city. The books by Physick and Sharples focus primarily on the\nevidence of past activities that has been left in the built environment,\nand attempt to relate this to the social history associated with the use\nof these buildings. Inevitably, however, the social history is relatively\nLiverpool: past, present and future 501\nbrief and narrowly focused. It would have been nice to know more about\nthe townscapes through which the Irish who lived in nineteenth-century\nLiverpool moved, and also to have a richer cultural and social history of the\nartefacts. This is not to criticize any of the books themselves, but I feel that\nthe conjunction of these volumes nicely reminds us, as urban historians,\nof the importance of seeking to link people and place, and of interpreting\nphysical structures within their social, cultural and political context. None\nof these books provides a complete urban history of Liverpool, and they\nwere not designed to do this, but they all provide rich evidence both for\nthose interested in Liverpool and for all urban historians who want good\ncomparative examples of how to examine the many different facets that\nall cities contain.\n"}
