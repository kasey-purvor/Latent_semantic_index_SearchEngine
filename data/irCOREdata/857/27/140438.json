In \nthe last 15 years there has been a growth of interest in using 2D arrays for uncooled \nthermal imaging [ 2 , 3 ].  In such arrays, the resolution of the image obtained is \ndetermined by the number of elements in the detector, and for these large numbers of \nvery small pyroelectric elements are needed.  Such devices have come under severe \ncompetition in the last few years from uncooled resistance bolometer arrays [4], to the \nextent that there are few commercial systems which now use pyroelectrics for themal \nimaging.  However, the characteristics of pyroelectric detectors, whereby they will give \nan output only for a change in infra-red flux, still makes them ideally-suited to the \nintruder and flame detection application.  In this scenario, no complex signal processing \nis needed to detect the presence of a warm target against a visually-cluttered, but static, \nbackground.  Pyroelectric detectors are still pre-eminent in these applications, \nparticularly as single, dual and quad-element detectors. Recently, it has been \ndemonstrated that low element count arrays (e.g. 16x16) can be very usefully applied to \nmany applications [5], such as people-counting and queue-length monitoring.  In these \napplications, high image resolution is not required and may, indeed, be seen as an \ninvasion of privacy by the subject.  In one application (SIMBAD [6]) the device has \nbeen applied to a fall detector, intended to enhance the quality of life of older persons \nwhile affording a greater sense of security and facilitating independent living.  This \npaper reviews the requirements of bulk ceramic and thin film materials for pyroelectric \ndetectors and some recent developments in the area. \n2 Pyroelectric Devices and Ceramic Materials \nFig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a pyroelectric infra-red detector.  A thin piece of \npyroelectric (the \u201celement\u201d) is electroded on its major faces and exposed to infra-red \nradiation, which produces a temperature change in the element.  The resulting \npyroelectric current, i\np\n which flows through the gate-bias resistor RG will be given by \ni\np\n=ApdT\/dt.  p is the pyroelectric coefficient and dT\/dt is the rate of change of the \nelement's temperature with time.  Thus, pyroelectric devices are coupled to the changes \nof any input energy flux \u2013 such as infra-red radiation - which generate a change in \nelement temperature with time.  \nThe physics of pyroelectric detectors has been reviewed previously [1].  If C\nE\n>>C\nA\n the \nvoltage response is proportional to a figure-of-merit (FoM) \no\nV c\npF \u03b5\u03b5'=  where \nc\u2032=volume specific heat,  \u03b5\no\n is the permittivity of free space and \u03b5  the relative \npermittivity of the pyroelectric material.  If C\nA\n>>C\nE\n the voltage response is proportional \nto 'c\npFi =  ,which would apply to maximising the response of very small elements.  \nHence, it can be seen that the choice of the appropriate material will depend both on the \namplifier to be used and on the size of the detector element.  Small area detector \nelements will tend to favour high dielectric constant materials and vice versa, to produce \na good match between C\nA\n and C\nE \n.  It is evidently insufficient to consider only the \nresponse of a detector when analysing its usefulness for a particular application.  It is \ngenerally necessary to analyse both intrinsic and extrinsic noise signals and compare \nthem with the response.  A figure-of-merit frequently used in the discussion of detector \nperformance is the specific detectivity D*.  To maximise D* in the region where \n 3\nJohnson Noise due to the loss tangent (tan\u03b4) of the pyroelectric material dominates, it is \ndesirable to maximise \u03b4\u03b5\u03b5 tan' oD c\npF = . \nThe structure of a typical pyroelectric array is shown schematically in Fig. 2.  These \narrays are microsystem-type devices in which each pyroelectric element is interfaced to \nits own integrated FET amplifier, these being linked by arrays of switches for \nmultiplexing.  The devices have been made possible through the flip-chip hybridisation \nof thin pyroelectric ceramic sensor layers with silicon application specific integrated \ncircuits (ASICs) \u2013 known as read-out integrated circuits (ROICs) [2].  In use, the \ndevices are placed at the focus of an infra-red lens, capable of focusing radiation in the \n8 to 12 micron wavelength range, usually made of germanium.  Because pyroelectric \ndevices are only sensitive to changes in temperature, and hence IR intensity, the array \ncan be used in two ways.  If the array is simply placed in the focal plane of the array, it \nwill not be sensitive to static scenes or objects which do not move.  This means that the \nsystem can be used in applications where there is a need to sense moving warm objects \nagainst a relatively unchanging background.  These include people counting and sensing \nsystems for use in retail applications.  Stogdale et al [7] have reported the use of a \n16x16 array [ 8 ] in a system for people counting and queue length monitoring \napplications.  Fig. 3 illustrates a visible (right) and infra-red (left) view of people \nwalking beneath a sensor system using this array.  The array is low resolution and is not \nused to create an image, but is linked to an automatic system which can count people.  \nRecently, such a system used for retail queue-length monitoring has won an award [9].  \nIf a means for modulating the radiation, such as a rotating chopper [10], is placed in \nfront of such an array, it can be used for producing thermal images. \n 4\n 5\n \n3 Pyroelectric Ceramics \nThere are two main classes of pyroelectric ceramics that are used commercially in infra-\nred detector arrays: ceramics with a Curie temperature TC well above ambient \n(typically>200\u00baC), so that the pyroelectric coefficient is reversible and stable and \nceramics with a TC around room temperature, for which the pyroelectric coefficient \nmust be stabilised by the application of a DC electric field.  The latter group of devices \nare frequently referred to as dielectric bolometers [10]. \nThe most widely used high TC pyroelectric ceramics are based on modified lead \nzirconate (PZ) [11,12 &13] or modified lead titanate [14].  The morphotropic phase \nboundary compositions of the PZT system are not used for pyroelectric applications \nbecause they have high permittivities.  The FoM for a selection of typical pyroelectric \nceramics are shown in Table 1. \nIn many cases, it is desirable to control the electrical conductivity of the pyroelectric \nceramic.  This will determine the electrical time constant (\u03c4E)of the detector element \n(\u03c4E=RG(CE+CA)) by fixing RG in Fig. 1. (Fixing RG also fixes the bias point of the FET.)  \n\u03c4E will also determine the time that the array takes to \u201csettle\u201d when the system \ntemperature is changed.  It has been shown [15,16] that uranium is a highly effective \ndopant for conductivity control in two families of modified lead zirconate ceramics and \nthat the behaviour can be modelled in terms of hopping conduction of carriers, probably \nelectrons, between localized sites in the ceramics.  This model predicts that log\u03c3 (where \n\u03c3 is the ceramic conductivity) is proportional to z-1\/3, where z is the amount of U-dopant \nadded.  Fig. 4 [16] illustrates this for these two ceramic families.  A similar type of \n 6\nbehaviour is followed for Cr-doping [17], except that this would be expected to act as \nan acceptor. \nIt can be seen that the basic figures-of-merit of the ceramic materials listed in Table 1 \nare quite similar, and indeed it is hard to improve on these by simply changing ceramic \ncomposition.  Further improvements in basic materials performance can, however, be \nobtained by structuring functionality into the ceramics, making functionally gradient \nmaterials (FGM).  Recently, it has been shown [18, 19] that thin layers of controlled \nporosity can be introduced into the middle of a PMNZTU ceramic wafer by using a tape \ncasting process in which particles of starch are introduced to produce controlled \nporosity once the tape is sintered.  The structure is shown schematically in Fig. 5.  Two \ntypes of samples were created, with different levels of starch in the central layer.  These \nwere labelled 1:1:1 or 1:2:1 according to whether 1 or 2 starch-containing green layers \nwere laminated into the centre of the specimen.  Fig. 6 shows a set of cross sections \nthrough a sintered 1:2:1 tri-layer.  The porous layer is clearly visible.  Average \nporosities for the sintered stacks were measured, as were the porosities of the dense \nsintered layers (4.2%) and from these the porosities of the central layers could be \ncalculated.  The porous layer has three major effects:  firstly it reduces the average \nrelative permittivity of the ceramic rather more quickly than the pyroelectric coefficient; \nsecondly it reduces the volume specific heat in direct proportion to the average porosity; \nfinally, it introduces a layer of lower thermal diffusivity, which acts as a thermal barrier \nin the system, retaining the heat energy in the pyroelectric element.  It has been \ndemonstrated [19] that increases in FV of 20% are achievable, and these can be directly \ntranslated into similar improvements in device performance.  Fig. 7 shows the measured \nvariation of FV with average porosity in a set of FGM samples.  Here, the dashed line is \na theoretical prediction based on the anticipated effect of the porosity on the dielectric, \npyroelectric and thermal properties, which gives: \n)}\n2\n31)(\n2\n31(\/{)]}1([\n2\n31{ LCoDDPLLCLD\nA\nV PPcfPPfpF \u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212= \u03b5\u03b5\u03c1  (1) \nwhere:  pD = pyroelectric coefficient of the dense ceramic \n fL = ratio of porous layer to total ceramic thickness = tL\/T = tL\/((2tC+tL) \n PC = porosity of the outer ceramic layers \n PL = porosity of the porous ceramic layer \n \u03c1D = theoretical density of ceramic \n cp = specific heat of dense ceramic \n \u03b5D = relative permittivity of fully-dense ceramic \nThe fit between theory and experiment is excellent. \n4 Pyroelectric Thin and Thick Films \nThe ability to integrate the pyroelectric material as a thin film directly onto the silicon \nwafer bearing the signal processing readout chips could give major benefits in cost \n(because no costly ceramic processing and bonding steps would be required) and \nperformance (because the thin films would be more thermally sensitive).  However, \nthere are many issues to address.  Firstly, the film must be an appropriate thickness for \nthe application.  For pyroelectric applications, the ideal thickness is between 0.1 and 1 \n\u03bcm in thickness, depending upon the details of the physical design of the array (e.g. IR \n 7\n 8\nabsorption mechanism, thermal isolation).  Secondly, the temperature of film growth \nmust be sufficiently low for the silicon metallization to survive.  This is typically \n<575\u00baC for an array with active silicon components, although it is strongly dependent \nupon atmosphere [20], and can be considerably lower in air.  It can be higher if an inert \natmosphere, or a wafer without active circuitry, is used.  Thirdly, while the structure \n(crystallite orientation, porosity) of a film is not necessarily an issue in its own right, it \nis usually intimately related to the final electrical properties, which are critically \nimportant.  Finally, film \u201cprocessability\u201d is very important in determining the ability to \nfabricate a device.  This includes the conformality (or otherwise) of the coating method, \nthe chemical compatibility of the layer with the underlying substrate and electrodes, the \ntechniques available for patterning the film and its general industrial acceptability. \nA wide range of Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) processes have been developed \nfor ferroelectric thin film fabrication.  Sol gel methods, in which the metal cations are \ntaken up into solution as alkoxides (for Zr and Ti) or acetates (for Pb and many dopant \nions such as Mn) are usually based on chelating solvents such as 2-methoxy ethanol \n(2ME) [21, 22], acetic acid with alcohols and stabilisers such as acetyl acetone and \nethylene glycol (EG) [23,24] and diols [25].  There has been a move to eliminate the \nuse of 2ME, because of its carcinogenic and teratogenic properties, leading to a greater \nemphasis on the use of simple alcohol solvents such as ethanol or methanol [26]. \nThe fabrication of Mn-doped pyroelectric PZT films is a good example of how CSD can \nbe used for the growth of ferroelectric thin films for MEMS applications [27].  In the \nparticular process used, Pb(OAc)2.3H2O and Mn(OAc)2 (1 mol %) were dissolved in a \nmethanol \/methanolamine (CH3OH\/MEA) mixture.  Zr(OnPr)4.nPrOH and Ti(OnBu)4 \nwere mixed separately and CH3CH2OH and a stoichometric amount of acetic acid were \n 9\nadded.  The Pb solution was added to the Zr\/Ti solution and acetic acid was added to \nadjust the pH and the PZT concentration to 0.4M.  This solution was spun onto \nPt(111)\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si(100) substrates (thickness Pt\/Ti\/SiO2 =100\/5\/500nm) at 3000 rpm \nfor 30s. Each layer was pre-fired on a hot plate set at 200 \u00b0C for 30s and then further \nannealed on another hot plate set at 530\u00b0C for 3 ~ 5min in air.  The thickness of a single \nlayer was about 70nm, so to obtain thicker films more layers were put down by \nrepeating the above procedure.  Au\/Cr top electrodes were used.  Access to the Pt \nbottom electrode was obtained by wet-etching a corner of PMZT film.  The PMZT thin \nfilm was poled by applying an electric field at 90\u00b0C.  \nZhang, Whatmore et al [27, 31] have reported on the pyroelectric and dielectric \nproperties of PMZT30\/70 films annealed at various temperatures up to 560\u00b0C.  The \ndielectric constant and loss tangent of a 1% Mn-doped film annealed at 530\u00b0C were 260 \nand 0.006 at 100 Hz and 257 and 0.0067 at 1 kHz, respectively, while the pyroelectric \ncoefficient was 3 x 10-4 CK-1m-2. Under similar processing conditions, non-doped \nPZT30\/70 thin films exhibit a dielectric constant of ~360 and loss tangent of 0.01 [27].  \nIn comparison with PZT thin film with similar thickness, the Mn doped PZT thin film \nhas a lower dielectric constant and a lower or equivalent loss tangent, which is of great \nsignificance in enhancing the performance of an infrared detector.  Usually, a PZT30\/70 \nthin film has a pyroelectric coefficient of 1~2 x 10-4 CK-1m-2.  Doping PZT with 1 \nmol% Mn increases the pyroelectric coefficient of the films significantly, leading to \nalmost a factor-of-three improvement in the figure-of-merit FD.  It seems likely that both \nof these improvements can be ascribed to the fact that the Mn acts as a \u2018hardening\u2019 \ndopant in the PZT lattice, creating oxygen vacancies and pinning the residual domains. \nIt is likely that the internal bias present in the film due to the addition of Mn acts to \n 10\nstabilize the internal polarization, accounting for the increase in the pyroelectric \ncoefficient.  The pyroelectric coefficient can be further improved by increasing the film \nannealing temperature from 530 \u00baC to 560\u00baC.  At 560\u00baC annealing temperature, the \ndielectric constant and loss of films is virtually the same as those at 530\u00baC but the \npyroelectric coefficient increased to 3.52 x 10-4 CK-1m-2, improving the FD to 3.85 x 10-\n5 Pa-0.5, one of the best reported for a PZT-based pyroelectric thin film [31]. \nThe introduction of porosity into films such as these has also been shown to result in a \nreduction in average permittivity and an increase in the pyroelectric figure-of-merit FV, \nby up to 25% relative to a fully-dense layer [28]. \nPMNZT type films were fabricated using a low temperature composite sol gel technique \n[29]. A ceramic producing sol and a ceramic powder are mixed together to produce a \nslurry which is then spun onto a substrate. Subsequent firing at much reduced \ntemperatures (550-800\u00baC) converts the sol to an oxide ceramic to form a thick film. \nIntermediate sol infiltration and pyrolysis can be used to vary the density of the films. \nTo demonstrate the use of the composite sol gel technique for producing thick \npyroelectric films it was decided to utilise a simplified sol composition \n(Pb1.05(Zr82.5Ti17.5)O3) due to the difficulties associated with obtaining a perovskite \nPMNZTU material using the sol gel process. The composition of the PMNZTU powder \nwas maintained at Pb1.01(Zr82.5Ti17.5)96.87(Mg1\/3Nb2\/3)2.5U0.63O3.  It was found that the \npyroelectric properties of such films depended strongly on the amount of infiltrating sol, \nas shown in Table 2 [30 ].  However, comparison with Table 1 shows that useful \npyroelectric figures-of-merit within a factor of two the bulk materials were obtained. \n \n 11\n5 Conclusions \nThe requirements for pyroelectric materials for use in infra-red detector arrays have \nbeen reviewed.  The properties of \u201cconventional\u201d pyroelectric ceramics have been \nshown to not be strongly dependent on the ceramic composition.  It has been \ndemonstrated that good control of important properties such as electrical resistivity can \nbe obtained by using off-valent doping.  It has been shown how the building-in of \nfunctionality through the thickness of a ceramic wafer can give substantial \nimprovements in device performance.  Ferroelectric thin films made using the sol gel \nprocess offer a route to making fully-integrated pyroelectric materials on silicon, and \nthat, again, the inclusion of controlled porosity into the film can improve the \npyroelectric figures-of-merit.  Thick films made using a composite sol-gel process can \noffer pyroelectric performances which, while lower than bulk materials, are still useful.   \n6 Acknowledgements \nThe financial support of EPSRC and IRISYS Ltd. is gratefully acknowledged.
