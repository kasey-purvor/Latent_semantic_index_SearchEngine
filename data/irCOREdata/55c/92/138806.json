Introduction 1 \n 2 \nAnaerobic digestion is an attractive option for treating wastewaters containing biodegradable 3 \norganic matter due to the ability to reduce pollution load and produce energy simultaneously. 4 \nWastewater carbon is converted to biogas, mainly methane, and in effect the treatment process 5 \nbecomes a net producer of energy (Liu et al., 2003; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004; Collins et al., 6 \n2006). Additionally, anaerobic digestion does not require costly aeration and produces less 7 \nsludge for disposal, indicating that it is generally more economically efficient than aerobic 8 \nsystems (McCarty, 2001). Anaerobic granular biofilms are formed via the self-immobilisation 9 \nof the microbial populations distributed within the domains Archaea and Bacteria. The biofilm 10 \nstructure, particularly in granular sludge, has underpinned the development of several 11 \ncategories of high rate anaerobic wastewater treatments conferring a number of advantages 12 \nover conventional processes (McCarty, 2001). 13 \nMost full-scale anaerobic digesters are operated at mesophilic or thermophilic 14 \ntemperatures (Liu et al., 2003; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004). Ambient or sub-ambient treatments 15 \nwere considered unattractive due to lower microbial activity and increased viscosity of liquids 16 \n(Rebac et al., 1999; Lettinga et al., 2001). However, the majority of industrial effluents are 17 \ndischarged at \u2264 18\u00b0C (Connaughton et al., 2006a), resulting in considerable heating costs for 18 \nmesophilic or thermophilic operation. Therefore, economic feasibility of anaerobic digestion 19 \ncould be enhanced by treating wastewaters at their discharge temperatures, resulting in a net 20 \nincrease in energy yield (Lettinga et al., 2001). A number of successful low-temperature 21 \nanaerobic digestion trials, treating various synthetic and real wastewaters, have demonstrated 22 \nrobust and stable operation with comparable performance to mesophilic systems. However, 23 \nthese studies used anaerobic granular sludge which was pre-granulated under mesophilic 24 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 4\nconditions, although the microbial populations gradually became psychrotolerent (Collins et 1 \nal., 2005; Connaughton et al., 2006a; McHugh et al., 2006). 2 \nMost studies on the fundamental microbial interactions in anaerobic digestion have 3 \nfocused on bioreactors operating under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Previous 4 \nstudies revealed the importance of aceticlastic methanogens, particularly belonging to the 5 \nfamily Methanosaetaceae, for the stable operation of anaerobic digesters (El-Mamouni et al., 6 \n1997; Diaz et al., 2006; Satoh et al., 2007). Efforts at altering digester operating conditions 7 \nhave been made to facilitate the growth and retention of high levels of Methanosaeta 8 \npopulations, greatly improving granule formation as well as process efficiency (Liu et al., 9 \n2002; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004). Currently, there is a dearth of basic information on microbial 10 \nbehaviour and interactions in anaerobic granular sludges cultivated at psychrophilic 11 \ntemperatures. Several critical questions have yet to be addressed: \u201cCan granular biofilms be 12 \neffectively cultivated at low-temperatures?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the numerically or functionally 13 \nimportant populations?\u201d This study focused on these knowledge gaps. 14 \nThree lab-scale expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) bioreactors treating a synthetic 15 \nglucose wastewater were operated at mesophilic (R1, 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and psychrophilic (R2 and 3, 16 \n15 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) temperatures. Formation of granular biofilm was successfully demonstrated in each 17 \nbioreactor. Methanogenic community structure and population dynamics, assoicated with low-18 \ntemperature granulation, was assessed by a combination of molecular and statistical tools. The 19 \nqualitative and quantitative changes in methanogenic community composition were monitored 20 \nusing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR techniques. 21 \n 22 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 23 \n 24 \nOperation of EGSB bioreactors 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 5\n 1 \nAnaerobic granular sludge (\u2205, 0.8-3.5 mm) was obtained from a full-scale internal circulation 2 \ndigester (Carbery Milk Products Ltd, Balineen, Co. Cork, Ireland) treating industrial alcohol 3 \nproduction wastewater at 37\u00b0C. The granular biomass was crushed and graded by sieving (\u2205 4 \n< 0.4 mm), and subsequently 88 g of volatile solids (VS) were used to seed three identical 5 \nEGSB bioreactors, with 4-L working volumes, denoted as R1 to 3. All bioreactors were 6 \noperated under the same conditions except temperature. R1 was operated at 37 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, while 7 \nboth R2 and 3 were maintained at 15 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Each system was operated at a 12-h hydraulic 8 \nretention time (HRT) to treat a synthetic glucose wastewater, which was buffered at pH 7.1 \u00b1 9 \n0.2 with NaHCO3 and fortified with trace elements (mg\/L): NiCl2\u00b76H20 (0.712), CoCl2\u00b76H20 10 \n(0.202), Na2Mo4\u00b72H20 (0.126), FeCl2\u00b76H20 (0.203) and yeast extract (170). The trial was 11 \ndivided into 5 phases, which were characterised by changes applied to the upflow velocity or 12 \norganic loading. Glucose was the sole carbon source in the wastewater and its content was 13 \nadjusted with respect to the organic loading rate (OLR). An OLR of 5.8 kg chemical oxygen 14 \ndemand (COD)\/m3\/d was applied during Phases 1 to 4, and upon the commencement of Phase 15 \n5, the rate was dropped to 2.8 kg COD\/m3\/d. The bioreactor effluent and biogas were 16 \nroutinely sampled for COD, pH, and CH4 content. 17 \n 18 \nSpecific methanogenic activity test 19 \n 20 \nThe specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of bioreactor biomass was determined at 30 d and 21 \n194 d, using the pressure transducer technique (Colleran et al., 1992). The substrates assayed 22 \nwere acetate (30 mM) and H2\/CO2 (80:20, v\/v) (Colleran et al., 1992; Coates et al., 1996). 23 \nEach assay was conducted with 3 g VS\/L of biomass in triplicate. Each biomass sample was 24 \ntested at the operating temperature of its corresponding bioreactor. 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 6\n 1 \nGranulation rate determination 2 \n 3 \nThe granulation rate was defined as the proportion of granules of which diameter is larger 4 \nthan 1.0 mm in the total biomass dry weight. The granulation rate of bioreactor biomass was 5 \ndetermined every 30-35 d. Approximately 30 mL of sludge from each bioreactor was graded 6 \nin a step wise manner using sieves (pore sizes, 1.4, 1.25, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2 mm). Each 7 \nbiomass size fraction was dried at 110\u00b0C for 24 h. The granulation rate was calculated based 8 \non dry weight. 9 \n 10 \nDNA extraction 11 \n 12 \nTotal DNA was extracted from bioreactor sludge granules (\u2205 > 1.0 mm) using an automated 13 \nnucleic acid extractor (Magtration System 12 GC, PSS Co., Chiba, Japan) (Lee et al., 2008). 14 \nPrior to extraction, each sample (0.5 g wet weight) was finely crushed using a mortar and 15 \npestle, and resuspended in 50 mL of double distilled water. A 100-\u03bcL aliquot of the 16 \nresuspended biomass sample was loaded per extraction. In parallel, the VS concentration of 17 \neach resuspension was measured to estimate the exact amount of biomass used for DNA 18 \nextraction. The extracted DNA was eluted in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at -20\u00b0C. 19 \nAll extractions were carried out in duplicate. 20 \n 21 \nDGGE and phylogenetic analyses 22 \n 23 \nArchaeal community profiles were investigated by DGGE analysis targeting the 16S rRNA 24 \ngene. Conventional PCR was performed using primers 787F and 1059R (Takai and 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 7\nHorikoshi, 2000). A 40-bp GC-clamp was attached at the 5\u2019-end of the forward primer for 1 \nstabilizing the melting behaviour of the PCR products (Muyzer et al., 1993). The PCR 2 \namplification was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min; a touch-down 3 \nthermal cycling of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1.5 min, annealing at 65 to 55\u00b0C for 1.5 min 4 \n(reducing 1\u00b0C per cycle), and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min; additional 20 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 \n1.5 min, 55\u00b0C for 1.5 min, 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min. A 20 \u03bcL aliquot of each PCR product was 6 \nloaded onto a 10% (w\/v) polyacrylamide gel containing a denaturing gradient of 30 to 60% 7 \n(100% denaturant contained 7 M urea and 40% (v\/v) formamide). Electrophoresis was run in 8 \na D-Code system (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The DGGE gel was ethidium bromide-stained and 9 \nphotographed under UV transillumination. A binary matrix was constructed from the gel 10 \nimage by scoring the presence or absence of each band with a 1 or 0, and then statistically 11 \nanalyzed based on Sorensen (Bray-Curtis) distance measure using MVSP software (Kovach 12 \nComputing Services, Pentraeth, UK) to build an unweighted pair group method arithmetic 13 \nmean (UPGMA) cluster tree. 14 \nIn parallel, for phylogenetic analysis, bands of interest were excised from the gel using 15 \na sterile scalpel blade. For accurate correlation of band homology between two DGGE gels, a 16 \nselected number of bands (i.e., J1, J5 and J7) were double-checked from both gels (Fig 2). 17 \nThe excised bands were eluted in 25 \u03bcL of sterile water, and then reamplified with the same 18 \nprimers (without GC-clamp). The PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the TOPO 19 \nTA 2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequence of each PCR fragment was 20 \ndetermined by sequencing with M13 primer and compared against the GenBank and RDP II 21 \ndatabases. A neighbour-joining tree was constructed using MEGA 4 software (Tamura et al., 22 \n2007). All nucleotide sequences reported in this study were deposited in the GenBank 23 \ndatabase under accession numbers FJ657373-FJ657380. 24 \n 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 8\nReal-time PCR analysis 1 \n 2 \nReal-time PCR was performed with five primer\/probe sets (Table 1), which cover most 3 \nmethanogens present in anaerobic digesters (Yu et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008), using a 4 \nLightCycler 1.2 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Each reaction mixture was prepared using the 5 \nLightCycler TaqMan Master kit (Roche): 8 \u03bcL of PCR-grade water, 1 \u03bcL of the probe (final 6 \nconcentration 200 nM), 1 \u03bcL of each primer (final concentration 500 nM), 4 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7 7 \nreaction solution, and 5 \u03bcL of DNA template. Amplification was carried out using a two-step 8 \nthermal cycling protocol consisted of predenaturation for 10 min at 94\u00b0C followed by 40 9 \ncycles of 10 s at 94oC and 30 s at 60oC (except 63oC for MMB-set). 10 \nQuantitative standard curves were constructed as previously described (Yu et al., 11 \n2006) using the representative strains corresponding to each primer\/probe sets used (Table 1). 12 \nA total of 12 standard plasmids containing the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 13 \nrepresentative strains, were kindly provided by Prof. S. Hwang, POSTECH, Korea (Yu et al., 14 \n2005). For each set, an equimolar mixture of its corresponding plasmids was used as the 15 \nstandard solution. The mass concentration of each standard plasmid was measured in 16 \nduplicate using a Qubit system (Invitrogen) and converted to its copy concentration as 17 \npreviously described (Lee et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2006). For each standard solution, a 10-fold 18 \nserial dilution series of 101 to 109 copies\/\u03bcL was generated and analyzed by real-time PCR in 19 \ntriplicate with its corresponding primer\/probe set.

In this phase, 3 \nthe sludge beds in both bioreactors were highly compacted and pistoned severely. This was 4 \nlikely caused by the prevailing liquid viscosity at the low operating temperature, which 5 \nprobably resulted in cumulative compaction of the sludge bed during the previous 90 days of 6 \noperation. During Phase 4, the upflow velocity was doubled to 2 m\/h and the low-temperature 7 \nbioreactors recovered from performance deterioration and exhibited 60-70% of COD removal 8 \nefficiencies. Correspondingly, the granulation ratio, which was maintained at approximately 9 \n20% during Phase 1 to 3, also increased to between 29 and 33% in this phase. In Phase 5, the 10 \nOLR was decreased by 50% to 2.9 kg COD\/m3\/d and R1 kept a high bioreactor performance 11 \nof > 95% COD removal. On the other hand, the COD removal efficiencies in R2 and 3 were \u2264 12 \n80% (Fig 2). A notable finding was the significant increase in the ratio of hydrogenotrophic to 13 \naceticlastic SMA values in the low-temperature bioreactors (Table 2). Throughout the trial, 14 \nthe ratio increased by between 2.1 and 3.3 fold in R2 and 3, whereas no significant change 15 \noccurred in the ratio of the mesophilic R1 (Table 2). Furthermore, the ratios measured in 16 \nPhase 1 highlighted that hydrogenotrophic activity was likely to be significantly higher (2.5-17 \n3.3 fold) than aceticlastic activity under low-temperature conditions, even in the early stage of 18 \noperation (Table 2). 19 \n 20 \nArchaeal DGGE profiles 21 \n 22 \nComparative PCR-DGGE analysis of the methanogenic granular biofilm communities under 23 \nmesophilic and psychrophillic conditions identified temperature-dependent differences in the 24 \ncommunity structures (Fig. 2). The R1 mesophilic community displayed no significant 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 11\ntemporal variation and the community profiles analysed at different time points throughout 1 \nthe operation clustered closely together with \u2265 92% similarity. This implies that the 2 \nqualitative methanogenic community structure (i.e., population diversity) in R1 was 3 \nreasonably consistent, despite the modification of operating parameters, throughout the trial. 4 \nThe DGGE profiles from two low-temperature bioreactors (i.e., R2 and 3) were highly similar 5 \nto each other and clustered closely together at each sampling point (Fig 2). A total of 8 bands 6 \n(J1 to 8) were retrieved from the archaeal DGGE gel and several ribotypes were found (Fig 3). 7 \nJ1, which appeared at 30 d in R1 and at 90 d in R2 and 3, was closely related to 8 \nMethanocorpusculum parvum, with 99.6% similarity (Table 3). This band also corresponded 9 \nto two other species within the same genus, M. bavaricum and M. labreanum. J2 to 4 were 10 \nonly detected in R1 from 30 d onwards and showed 95.5 to 100% similarity to 11 \nMethanospirillium hungatei. J8, which appeared only in R2 and 3 from 120 d onwards, was 12 \nclosely related to two Methanosarcina species, M. mazei and M. lacustris, with 100% 13 \nsimilarity. The remaining three bands were commonly detected in all DGGE lanes (Fig 2). J5 14 \nand 6 were related to Methanosaeta concilii (98.5-98.8%) and J7 was related to 15 \nMethanobacterium beijingeise (100%; Table 3). Consequently, 5 out of the 8 deduced 16 \nsequences were affiliated with hydrogenotrophic methanogens (J1 to 4 and 7) and the 17 \nremaining three were with aceticlastic methanogens (J5, 6 and 8). 18 \n 19 \nQuantitative analysis of methanogenic community 20 \n 21 \nThe real-time PCR results showed clear changes in the quantitative composition of the 22 \nmethanogenic community of each bioreactor over time (Fig. 4). In the seed sludge, in terms of 23 \n16S rRNA gene concentration, the aceticlastic family Methanosaetaceae was absolutely 24 \ndominant (98% of the measured methanogenic population, i.e., the sum of all 16S rRNA gene 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 12\nconcentrations quantified with the primer\/probe sets used). This corresponds to the previously 1 \nreported high abundance of Methanosaetaceae-related species in stable granular anaerobic 2 \ndigesters (Diaz et al., 2006; Satoh et al., 2007; Fernandez et al., 2008). In R1, the 3 \nMethanosaetaceae 16S rRNA gene concentration decreased by about 100 folds, along with a 4 \n100-fold increase in Methanobacteriales, after 30 d of operation. The Methanosaetaceae 5 \nconcentration increased again up to 8.5 \u00d7 1010 copies\/g granule VS and remained at around 6 \n1010 level. On the other hand, Methanobacteriales showed no significant change during the 7 \ntrial and remained at a reasonably constant level. Methanomicrobiales also showed a 8 \nconsiderable increase, particularly after 30 d, and the three methanogenic groups detected in 9 \nR1 showed similar 16S rRNA gene levels of 2.9 to 4.7 \u00d7 1010 copies\/g granule VS at trial 10 \ncompletion at 194 d. Interestingly, no detectable level of Methanosarcinaceae population was 11 \nfound in R1, which maintained a high treatment efficiency throughout the trial (Table 2). 12 \nThe two low-temperature bioreactors showed similar patterns in quantitative 13 \ncommunity dynamics. Contrary to R1, Methanosaetaceae was missing during the early period 14 \nand Methanosarcinaceae was detected in the later period of operation in R2 and 3. A notable 15 \ndifference between the mesophilic and psychrophilic bioreactors is the dramatic drop and 16 \nregrowth of the hydrogenotrophic order Methanomicrobiales, becoming the most abundant 17 \ngroup in the later period under low-temperature conditions. In both R2 and 3, its 16S rRNA 18 \ngene concentration increased up to about 1.0 \u00d7 1011 copies\/g granule VS and comprised 66.7-19 \n77.2% of the total measured methanogenic population at the end of the trial. In comparison, 20 \nthe other three methanogenic groups were detected at abundances of around 1.0 \u00d7 1010 21 \ncopies\/g granule VS. 22 \nConsequently, our quantification results clearly demonstrated the significantly higher 23 \nabundance of hydrogenotrophic populations, particularly Methanomicrobiales group, in the 24 \nlow-temperature bioreactors than in the mesophilic one. This indicates that the methanogenic 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 13\nactivities in R2 and 3 were probably significantly more dependent on hydrogenotrophic 1 \nmetabolism. The order Methanobacteriales exhibited a relatively even distribution in each 2 \nbioreactor tested, and the order Methanococcales was not detected at any trial point. In this 3 \nstudy, the real-time PCR detection limit for each primer\/probe set was < 107 copies\/g granule 4 \nVS level. 5 \n 6 \nDISCUSSION 7 \n 8 \nHigh COD removal efficiency of around 95% was observed in R1 during the trial, whereas it 9 \nwas considerably lower (ca. 60-70%) in R2 and 3. The granulation rate was also significantly 10 \nhigher (ca. 2.4-4.1 fold) in R1 (Table 2). The replicated low-temperature bioreactors, R2 and 3, 11 \nshowed reproducible performance (Fig. 1), and the methanogenic community compositions of 12 \nthe reactors, qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by DGGE and real-time PCR analyses, 13 \nwere also highly comparable. These results suggest that the low-temperature bioreactors were 14 \nreproducible in terms of microbial dynamics as well as system performance. 15 \nThe clustering analysis of the archaeal DGGE profiles demonstrated that the qualitative 16 \narchaeal community structures changed significantly during the initial 90 d, and that they 17 \nremained relatively constant (> 92% similarity) afterwards in R2 and 3. This notable variation 18 \nduring the early period of operation seems to be, at least partly, due to the adaption of 19 \nmethanogens from the mesophilic seed inoculum to low-temperature conditions. In R1, the 20 \ngreatest variation with 30% distance was observed between the seed and 30-d samples, and the 21 \ncommunity structure varied little (< 6% distance) during the remaining period. This may reflect 22 \nthe faster establishment of a stable granular methanogenic community, developed from the 23 \nmesophilic seed inoculum, under mesophilic conditions in R1, which would be expectable. 24 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 14\nConcerning the real-time PCR quantification, it should be mentioned that the order 1 \nMethanococcales was not detected in any sample assayed. This absence of Methanococcales-2 \nrelated organisms was probably due to their growth requirement of high salt conditions (0.3 to 3 \n9.4% (w\/v) NaCl) (Boone et al., 2001). Methanobacteriales was detected in the seed and all 4 \nbioreactor samples. Its population varied little, except during the initial 30 d period, and was 5 \nmostly maintained at above 1.0 x 1010 copies\/g granule VS in all bioreactors. Among the 6 \nDGGE band sequences, J7 related to M. beijingens was the only one affiliated with the order 7 \nMethanobacteriales (Table 3). This species has previously been isolated from anaerobic 8 \ndigesters treating paper mill wastewater (Ma et al., 2005). Although its optimum growth 9 \ntemperature is known to be 37\u00b0C, the growth of the members of the same genus has been 10 \nreported at temperatures as low as 4\u00b0C (Metje and Frenzel, 2007), supporting its potential to 11 \nadapt to psychrophilic conditions. 12 \nThe family Methanosaetaceae was the most abundant group in the seed biomass, but 13 \nits quantitative dynamics differed markedly according to the operating temperature (Fig. 4). 14 \nAlthough the two Methanosaeta concilii-related bands, J5 and 6, were found in all DGGE 15 \nlanes (Fig. 2), the Methanosaetaceae 16S rRNA gene concentration was under the real-time 16 \nPCR detection limit at 30 and 90 d in R2 and at 30 d in R3. Interestingly, at around 90 d, R2 17 \nand 3 exhibited virtually the only disagreement in process performance, that is, the sudden 18 \ntemporary increase in COD removal efficiency from < 60% to > 80% in R3 (Fig. 1). The 19 \nreasons for which remain unclear, however, it was well correlated with the detection of high 20 \nabundance (i.e., 1.0 x 1011 copies\/g granule VS) of Methanosaetaceae, a dominant and vital 21 \nmethanogenic group under stable conditions (Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004; Diaz et al., 2006), at 90 22 \nd in R3 only. On the other hand, no apparent relationship between the biomass granulation rate 23 \nand the abundance of Methanosaetaceae was found in all bioreactors, which is inconsistent 24 \nwith previous reports that the Methanosaeta species play a major role in anaerobic granulation 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 15\n(Liu et al., 2002; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004). Additionally, the rapid drop and rise of 1 \nMethanosaetaceae during the early period in the low-temperature bioreactors may indicate that 2 \nthis group was affected by cold-adaptation and is possibly sensitive to temperature change. 3 \nThe aceticlastic family Methanosarcinaceae appeared after 120 d of operation in R2 4 \nand 3 only, but it was not detected throughout the operation in R1 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, this 5 \ngroup appeared after the deterioration of COD removal (\u2264 24%) observed in Phase 3 (Figs. 1 6 \nand 4). This corresponds well to the fact that this group favours substrate rich environment (i.e., 7 \nhigh organic acids levels) and grows faster than the other aceticlastic family Methanosaetaceae 8 \n(Boone et al., 2001). Previous studies have also suggested that the members of this family are 9 \ntypically associated with high residual acetate concentration accompanied with process 10 \ndeterioration (Wiegant and Deman, 1986; Collins et al., 2003; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004). 11 \nTherefore, the appearance of this group was thought to be correlated with the bioreactor 12 \ndeterioration, resulting in the high accumulation of organic acids, in the low-temperature 13 \nbioreactors. Corresponding to this phase, the acetate concentration in R2 and 3 was c.a. 1.2 g\/L, 14 \nwhich was almost 1000 times greater than its level in R1. Additionally, R2 and 3 exhibited 0.1-15 \n0.3 g\/L of propionate and 0.05-0.1 g\/L of butyrate, whereas their concentrations were <5 mg\/L 16 \nin R1 (data not shown). Although it has been reported that the anaerobic digesters dominated 17 \nby Methanosarcinaceae-related organisms are also able to perform \u2018spontaneous granulation\u2019, 18 \nthis type of granular biofilm tends to be less dense and to be washed out relatively easily 19 \n(Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004). The DGGE band J8 affiliated with Methanosarcinaceae was 20 \nassigned to M. mazei and M. lacustris with 100% similarity (Table 3). M. mazei has been 21 \nfrequently observed in anaerobic digestion systems (Diaz et al., 2006) and is able to utilize a 22 \nvariety of substrates, including acetate, H2\/CO2, methanol, and methylamines (Boone et al., 23 \n2001). Additionally, growth of M. mazei-like organisms have been reported at temperatures as 24 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 16\nlow as 5\u00b0C (Simankova et al., 2003), indicating its ability to grow under low-temperature 1 \nconditions. 2 \nThe most intriguing observation in this study is the quantitative variation of the order 3 \nMethanomicrobiales particularly in the low-temperature bioreactors (Fig. 4). This group was 4 \ndetected in seed biomass and all bioreactor samples, but showed significantly different 5 \ndynamics under mesophilic and psychrophilic conditions. Methanomicrobiales accounted for 6 \n1.5 to 44.3% of the total methanogenic 16S rRNA gene concentration in R1, whereas its 7 \nabundance reached up to 66.7 to 77.2% in R2 and 3. This group showed 1200- to 8400-fold 8 \nincrease, from its minimum to maximum concentrations, in R2 and 3, whereas only a 54-fold 9 \nincrease was noted in R1. Such results indicate that this hydrogenotrophic order would be the 10 \nkey methanogenic group in the low-temperature bioreactors. In this study, it is not evident 11 \nwhich factor mainly affected the high dominance of Methanomicrobiales, because the upflow 12 \nvelocity or OLR were changed during the 194-d experiment of cold-adaptation. However, 13 \ngiven that a remarkable rise or high dominance of ethanomicrobiales was not shown in the 14 \nmesophilic R1, operated with the same strategy as R2 and 3, low temperature seems to be the 15 \nmajor factor facilitating the dominance of this group. Supporting this, several previous studies 16 \non mesophilic granular biofilms incubated at low temperatures have reported the temporal 17 \nmethanogenic community shifts towards the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, 18 \nparticularly Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales (McHugh et al., 2004; Connaughton 19 \net al., 2006b). Although four DGGE band sequences (from J1 to 4) were assigned to the order 20 \nMethanomicrobiales only J1 was detected in the low-temperature bioreactors. Interestingly, J1 21 \nwas solely assigned to the genus Methanocorpusculum, whereas J2 to 4 were all related to the 22 \ngenus Methanospirillum (Table 3). This suggests that the Methanomicrobiales community 23 \ncomposition might be affected by the operating temperature. Our observation corresponds to 24 \nthe previous studies reporting increased abundance of Methanocorpusculum-like organisms 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 17\nduring the cold adaptation of anaerobic granular sludge (Collins et al., 2003; McHugh et al., 1 \n2004). Given the band intensity, although not robustly quantitative, the Methanocorpusculum-2 \nlike organism deduced from J1 was likely to be the major hydrogenotrophic population in the 3 \nlow-temperature bioreactors, particularly from 90 d onwards. This banding pattern is in good 4 \nagreement with the quantification results of Methanomicrobiales (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in 5 \nmesophilic R1, J1 disappeared over time even with the continuous increase in the 16S rRNA 6 \ngene concentration of Methanomicrobiales, indicating the major population of this group was 7 \nshifted to the others possibly including the Methanospirillum-like organisms deduced from J2 8 \nto 4 (Fig. 2). 9 \nThe physiological profiles generated from the reactor biomass were in good agreement 10 \nwith the quantitative molecular studies. For example, the hydrogenotrophic SMA value was 11 \nsignificantly higher than the aceticlastic activity in both R2 and 3, whereas they were evenly 12 \ndistributed in R1. Furthermore, the hydrogenotrophic to aceticlastic SMA value ratio increased 13 \nsignificantly (2.1-3.3 times) in R2 and 3 (Table 2) as the trial progressed. This, together with 14 \nthe increase in and dominance of hydrogenotrophic groups, particularly Methanomicrobiales, 15 \nagain suggests their numerical and functional importance under low-temperature conditions. 16 \nSupporting this, the dominance of hydrogenotrophs at low temperatures has been reported in 17 \nseveral previous studies (Collins et al., 2005; Connaughton et al., 2006a; McHugh et al., 18 \n2006), where very high COD removal efficiencies (>95%) were reported during low-19 \ntemperature anaerobic digestion. This phenomenon was proposed to be because hydrogen is 20 \nthermodynamically and metabolically more favourable than acetate and higher level of 21 \nhydrogen can be retained in the system (i.e., increased gas solubility) at low temperature 22 \n(Lettinga et al., 2001; Kotsyurbenko, 2005). The fate of acetate in such systems remains a 23 \ntopic of considerable interest, with respect to the possible role of syntrophic actetate oxidation 24 \n(Schnurer et al., 1994), which would be a subject of further investigation. 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 18\n 1 \nCONCLUSIONS 2 \n 3 \nIn this study, temporal changes in the archaeal community architecture of granular biofilms 4 \nwere successfully related to physiological methanogenic activity profiles and reactor operating 5 \nconditions. Low temperature anaerobic digestion was shown to be reproducible, both in terms 6 \nof operational performance and microbial community structure. Hydrogenotrophic 7 \nmethanogens, from the order Methanomicrobiales, emerged as a key functional group during 8 \nlow-temperature anaerobic digestion. 9 \n 10 \nz At applied OLRs of 2.9 to 5.8 kg COD\/m3\/d, a moderate COD removal efficiency of 46 to 11 \n74% with a biomass granulation rate of 18 to 33% was achieved at 15 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C, while a high 12 \ntreatment efficiency of 93 to 98% with a biomass granulation rate of 63 to 87% was observed 13 \nat 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. 14 \nz The quantitative real-time PCR analysis highlighted the clear dominance shift from 15 \naceticlastic towards hydrogenotrophic methanogens, particularly the order Methanomicrobiales, 16 \nin the low-temperature bioreactors. 17 \nz The SMA test results also showed the evident increase in the activity of hydrogen-mediated 18 \nmethanogenesis (i.e., 2.1-3.3 folds), while the level of aceticlastic activity showed no change, 19 \nduring the trial period. 20 \nz The DGGE banding patterns were in good agreement with the real-time PCR quantification 21 \nresults and suggested that a Methanocorpusculum-like organism was likely to be the major 22 \nhydrogenotrophic population, probably mainly responsible for the dynamic changes and cold 23 \nadaptation of methanogenic communities. 24 \n 25 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 19\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 1 \nThis publication emanates from research conducted with the financial support of Science 2 \nFoundation Ireland.
