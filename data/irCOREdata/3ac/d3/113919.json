The main\naim was an examination of the mean flow, turbulence and flow pathlines characterising a\ncomplex 3-dimensional urban location. The experiments highlighted the complexity of the\nobserved flows, particularly in the upwind region of the intersection. In this complex and\nrealistic situation some details of the upwind flow, such as the presence of two tall tow-\ners, play an important role in defining the flow field within the intersection, particularly at\nroof level. This effect is likely to have a strong influence on the mass exchange mecha-\nnism between the canopy flow and the air aloft, and therefore the distribution of pollutants.\nThis strong interaction between the flows inside and outside the urban canopy is currently\nneglected in most state-of-the-art local scale dispersion models.\n1 Introduction\nAir pollution in cities is a major environmental concern and, despite significant improvements\nin fuel and engine technology, present day urban atmospheric environments are mostly domi-\nnated by traffic emissions (Vardoulakis et al., 2003). Human exposure to hazardous substances\nis expected to be highest especially in those areas where population and traffic density are\nrelatively high. Understanding flow and dispersion in urban streets is therefore of paramount\nimportance for air quality management and planning for a number of reasons, mainly related to\nhuman health. Furthermore, the present international political situation adds further concerns,\nas the deliberate discharge of toxic material in populated areas is a serious threat.\nThe dispersion of pollutants and their causes and effects on buildings and population have\nbeen the object of a number of studies. However, those available in the literature generally deal\nwith simplified layouts reproducing the principal features of an urban environment: canyons,\nintersections, regular and staggered building arrays. Empirical models have been developed\nalong with numerical models and experimental validation in the field and in wind tunnels.\nAlthough most work has focussed on simple geometries, nevertheless some attempts to study\nreal urban situations have produced interesting insights into the dispersion process.\nThe study of urban street canyons has dominated short range dispersion research in urban\nareas (see the reviews of Vardoulakis et al., 2003; Berkowicz et al., 1997; Britter and Hanna,\n1\n2003). However, a number of studies (e.g. Soulhac, 2000; Scaperdas, 2000) showed the impor-\ntance of three-dimensional effects at intersections, in particular the exchange of air, and hence\npollutants, between the street systems involved. Pollution hotspots may be found at street inter-\nsections due to the presence of high traffic levels and traffic lights and they are more common\nthan regular street canyons in real cities. Intersections show a highly complex flow that is\nstrongly three-dimensional, as opposed to that in street canyons.\nMost of the research in urban environment-related topics has primarily been concerned\nwith concentration measurements. This is because this knowledge is directly linked with the\nassessment of effects on population exposure and health. Nevertheless, knowledge of the three-\ndimensional flow field characterising a real urban environment is very important because it\nprovides a better understanding of the possible paths followed by a pollutant released at urban,\nneighbourhood and local scales. Moreover the database produced by such an analysis is of great\ninterest for the development of semi-empirical and numerical models, useful for predicting air\nquality in urban areas.\nPavageau et al. (2001) performed wind tunnel experiments on a two-dimensional canyon\nmodel set in a fetch of two-dimensional canyons that simulated the surrounding city and en-\nsured full development of the internal boundary layer. Different aspect ratios, building heights,\nroof shapes and canyon lengths were considered. They pointed out a strong influence of canyon\nand roof geometry on wind-driven street ventilation. Xie et al. (2005) employed CFD tech-\nniques for the analysis of the influence of geometry on the mean flow field inside an urban\ncanyon. A number of configurations was considered: (a) symmetrical canyon geometry; (b)\nstep-up notch; (c) step-down notch. In the first case a single vortex was generated inside the\ncanyon, while in the step-down notch case a vortex with its centre located above the lower roof\nlevel was found, with a second counter-rotating vortex located lower in the canyon. Finally,\nthe step-up notch configuration presented a single distorted vortex with the centre of rotation\nslightly lifted towards the windward side. Garcia Sagrado et al. (2002) performed wind-tunnel\nexperiments on both an isolated street canyon in open country and a non-isolated canyon. In\nboth cases, a large separated flow region developed above the roof due to the approach flow\nimpacting against the first upstream building. A recirculation region was observed above the\nstreet when the buildings forming the canyon were of the same height.\nIn the field experiments of Louka et al. (2000), mean and turbulent velocity fields were\nmeasured and the flow within and above a non-isolated street canyon studied when the wind\nblew perpendicularly to the street. The recirculation in the street was found to be unsteady\nand dominated by turbulent fluctuations. Furthermore they noted that the shear layer, shed\nfrom the upstream roof, became unstable through Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The mixing\nof the air between the canyon and air aloft was therefore attributed to a large-scale flapping of\nthe shear layer. Uehara et al. (2000) found that the flow in a street canyon was also strongly\naffected by atmospheric stability. In particular, the cavity eddy developing within the canyon\nbecame weaker when the atmosphere was stable and stronger when unstable. The mixing in the\ncanyon was enhanced in unstable conditions, which caused the vertical temperature gradient to\ndecrease and with it the thermal instability.\nBritter and Hanna (2003), in a detailed review of flow and dispersion in urban areas, pointed\nout some features of flow in and around street canyons. The height of the buildings is a first\ndiscriminating parameter in defining flow regimes and affects the depth of the roughness sub-\nlayer, which is commonly identified as a region in which the underlying buildings lead to a\nspatial horizontal inhomogeneity of the flow and which is usually considered to extend to ap-\n2\nproximately twice the building height. Some disagreement was found in the literature over the\nspatially averaged mean velocity profile over an urban canopy or very rough surface. These\ndiscrepancies were thought to be caused by the difficulty in specifying reference parameters,\nsuch as the friction velocity, displacement height or roughness length. This problem has also\nbeen partly described by Kastner-Klein et al. (2001). The geometry of the buildings and, in\ngeneral, of the urban area also has a major influence on the production of turbulence inside\nand outside a canyon. Generally, for cities with large building plan and frontal area densities,\nturbulence is mainly generated by the interaction of the flow near the top of the canopy with\nthe building tops and subsequent advection into the canyon. In small building plan and small\nfrontal area density configurations, on the contrary, turbulence is generated within the canopy\nitself and is characterised by high Reynolds stresses in the region where turbulence is gener-\nated. As far as the recirculation flow within the canyon is concerned, this is neither steady\nnor symmetrical, with stronger and more concentrated downflow near the windward wall and a\nweaker and more extensive upflow closer to the leeward face. Large aspect-ratio configurations\ngenerally also contain a counter-rotating vortex below the main recirculation flow. Flow that is\nnot perpendicular to the canyon generates a flow field consisting of a recirculation vortex and\nan along-street component, together forming a helical circulation. Finally, the role of traffic\nwas identified as a further source of turbulence, together with wind and thermal gradients. The\nexchange mechanism in isolated and non-isolated canyons was part of the work by Meroney\net al. (1996). They concluded that in a canyon in otherwise open country the vortex gener-\nated within the canyon itself is generally unstable and is discharged at regular intervals. On\nthe contrary, inside an urban canyon a stable rotating vortex develops and street ventilation is\nsuppressed, resulting in pollution being trapped at street level. Despite these studies, details of\nthe exchange mechanisms, and the velocities and fluxes between a canyon and the flow above,\nare not well understood and stand in need of further research.\nKastner-Klein et al. (2001) underlined a common difficulty encountered in many studies.\nObservations from field measurements can rarely be compared with data from either wind\ntunnel or computational approaches. This is due, as has been pointed out above, to the inappro-\npriate or unsatisfactory choice of a reference velocity and to the inherent uncertainties involved\n(see also Schatzmann et al., 1997). Nevertheless, their results are in substantial agreement with\nother studies and show that the flow over a street canyon is accelerated above roof level. Turbu-\nlence intensities were found to take relatively high values in the canopy layer above the canyon\nbut rather uniform and low values within the canyon.\nAs is clear from the literature, the most important limit to the development of urban air\nquality models is the lack of experimental data. In the past there has been a tendency to perform\nrather narrowly focussed urban dispersion experiments (Robins and Macdonald, 2001), though\nseveral large field and wind tunnel experiments have recently been, or are being, attempted\n(Hunt et al., 2002). Physical modelling has been performed mostly within highly idealised\ngeometries. As stated by Robins and Macdonald (2001), there is a need for tests in less \u2018regular\u2019\nand more realistic building arrangements in order to produce more reliable datasets.\nIn the present work both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in order to describe\nthe complex three-dimensional flow field in a real environment. Firstly, flow visualisation tech-\nniques were applied in a wind tunnel on a 1:200 scale model of a central London site, with\nparticular focus on a busy street-canyon intersection. Following this qualitative description,\na detailed mapping of the velocity flow field was performed using a two-component Laser-\nDoppler Anemometer (LDA) to obtain velocity measurements on the same model. The main\n3\naim of the study was an examination of the mean flow, turbulence and flow pathlines character-\nising a complex, three-dimensional urban location.\nThe study is part of a multidisciplinary project, Dispersion of Air Pollution and its Pene-\ntration into the Local Environment (DAPPLE, Arnold et al., 2004), whose aim is to enhance\nunderstanding of pollutant dispersion processes in realistic urban environments. One of the\nnovel aspects of DAPPLE, when compared to other similar studies, is its multidisciplinary ap-\nproach to the problem: field measurements of wind conditions, background pollution levels,\ntraffic flow, personal exposure and the dispersion of inert tracer releases were supported by\nboth wind tunnel and numerical studies. Furthermore, the focus was a real urban intersection,\ncharacterised by buildings of different shape and height, not uninterrupted, two-dimensional\ncanyons of different widths and lengths.\n2 Experimental set-up\nThe DAPPLE site is located at the intersection of Marylebone Road and Gloucester Place in\ncentral London, U.K., with a surrounding study area approximately 250-300 m in radius. Wind\ntunnel modelling extends to a radius of about 500 m. Marylebone Road is a busy dual car-\nriageway (A501), up to seven lanes wide, and forms the northern boundary of the London Con-\ngestion Charging Zone, while Gloucester Place has three lanes, one-way northbound (Baker\nStreet is southbound one block to the east). The roads intersect perpendicularly and Maryle-\nbone Road runs approximately from west-south-west to east-north-east. The prevailing wind is\nfrom south-west, and the average building height is approximately 22 m.\nThe primary characteristic of the area is that it is a real site and the heights and sizes of\nthe buildings and streets are all different (see figure 1); e.g. Marylebone Road is about twice as\nwide as Gloucester Place. Building 5, that is the Westminster City Council (WCC), is about 15\nm tall, only 4 m taller than building 2 (Marathon House, MH), which is the shortest. However,\nthese are the heights to roof level and the common feature of the two buildings is a tower. The\nWCC tower has a small cross-section and is 34 m high whereas the tower on Marathon House\nis 53 m high, and has a wide cross-section. Both significantly affect the flow.\nThe experiments were carried out in the boundary layer wind tunnel of the Environmental\nFlow Research Centre (EnFlo), University of Surrey, U.K. This is an open circuit \u2018suck-down\u2019\nwind tunnel with a 20 m long, 3.5 m wide and 1.5 m high working section. The air speed\nrange is from 0.3 to 3.5 m s\u22121, and the facility is capable of simulating both stable and unsta-\nble atmospheric conditions, although this feature was not used in our study. Reference flow\nconditions are measured by two ultrasonic anemometers, one held at a fixed location and the\nother positioned as required, with two propeller anemometers mounted on either side of the tra-\nverse carriage. The motor shaft speed is also monitored. Temperature conditions are monitored\nby thermocouple rakes in the flow and individual thermocouples in each tunnel wall panel.\nThe pressure drop across the inlet is also monitored, primarily to indicate the state of the inlet\nscreens. The wind tunnel and the associated instrumentation are fully automated and controlled\nusing virtual instrument software developed at EnFlo using LabVIEW.\nA site co-ordinate system was defined to be aligned with the street network. The origin\nwas the centre of the intersection, with the X axis along Marylebone Road to the east. A wind\ndirection of 0o corresponded to flow parallel to the X axis (in the west to east direction) and the\nmodel rotation angle was defined positive anticlockwise.\n4\nFigure 1: The 1:200 basic block model (left) and three-dimensional rendering (right) of the\nDAPPLE site in the EnFlo wind tunnel (WCC, Westminster City Council; MH, Marathon\nHouse)\nThe central part of the model installed in the wind tunnel is shown in figure 1-left. This\nis the simplest DAPPLE site model, where all buildings have been reduced to simple blocks\nwith flat roofs at a geometrical scaling factor of 1:200. The approach flow boundary layer\nwas generated in a standard manner, using Irwin spires and surface roughness upwind of the\nmodel. This produced a well developed boundary layer upstream of the model with thickness\nof approximately 1 m, a surface roughness length z0=1.5 mm (equivalent to 0.3 m at full scale)\nand a normalised friction velocity, u\u2217\/Ure f =0.057. Details of this flow are included with the\nfull experimental dataset, as described in table 1. Most of the tests were carried out with a\nreference air speed (Ure f ) of about 2.5 m s\u22121. Ure f was measured with the fixed ultrasonic\nanemometer positioned outside of the boundary layer. The model was oriented using the wind\ntunnel turntable, and all the experiments were performed with a rotation of \u221251.35o in model\ncoordinates (i.e. wind approximately from the south-west); this wind direction was chosen as it\ncorresponded to the direction for the first field tracer release experiment (Arnold et al., 2004).\nFlow visualisation techniques were applied in order to describe qualitatively the flow pat-\nterns within the model. This work was then completed by high resolution measurements of\nwind velocity and turbulence, performed using a two-component laser Doppler anemometer.\n3 Flow visualisation\n3.1 Experimental strategy\nFlow visualisation (FV) techniques were employed to analyse the flow field in an area in and\naround the Marylebone Road\/Gloucester Place intersection using smoke that was released from\na small source and illuminated by a laser light sheet. Light used to illuminate the smoke be-\ncomes scattered by smoke particles in all directions, and the intensity of scattered light at any\nposition in the flow is, ideally, proportional to the concentration of smoke particles.\nVideo records were taken for each combination of source position and light sheet configura-\ntion. In order to obtain a detailed map of the flow at the intersection, a small smoke source was\n5\nlocated in 12 different positions: at the centre, at the south side and at the north side of Maryle-\nbone Road (upwind from the intersection), and at the centre, at the east side and at the west\nside of Gloucester Place; further, sources were located at two different heights (10 and 40 mm).\nA second set of experiments was subsequently carried out later, using the same experimental\nset-up. Smoke was released at five different positions (three in Marylebone Road, and two in\nGloucester Pl), and at only one height (10 mm). The laser sheet was directed either westbound\nalong Marylebone Road, or southbound along Gloucester Place. Horizontal sections were vi-\nsualised at different heights (20, 40 and 60 mm during the first set of experiments, 25 and 50\nmm during the second set). Three vertical sections in Marylebone Road (south side, centre, and\nnorth side) and one in Gloucester Place (centre) were also visualised during the experiments.\nThe video records produced by the flow visualisation experiments were then reviewed and\nanalysed. Screenshots were also captured in order to highlight the main features of the observed\nflow.\n3.2 Flow in horizontal planes\nThe main patterns of the observed horizontal flow field are shown in figure 2 (stills captured\nfrom the video records). The video records were essential in developing the flow descriptions\nand the stills in the figure are included here to illustrate specific features.\nAs far as the lowest levels (20-25 mm) are concerned, a large recirculating vortex was ob-\nserved downwind of the intersection, at the south side of Marylebone Road (figure 2, top-left).\nIn fact, the main tendency of the flow within Gloucester Place was to turn into Marylebone\nRoad, continuing as a jet along the north side of Marylebone Road, and creating the recircu-\nlation vortex cited above. At higher levels, part of the flow from Gloucester Place continues\nalong its path northwards. Intermittently however, the fraction flow affected by this behaviour\nincreases, creating a smaller localised recirculation pattern in Marylebone Road upwind of the\nintersection (figure 2, top-right).\nThe incoming flow along Marylebone Road followed a more complex path. A highly turbu-\nlent flow was observed approaching the intersection, probably reflecting an underlying complex\nthree-dimensional mean flow. At the intersection the general behaviour was to continue along\nMarylebone Road, joining the incoming jet from Gloucester Place. Just as for the latter, the\nflow occasionally deviated into Gloucester Place, causing another recirculation vortex on the\nwest side of the street. Flow patterns were similar at higher levels, 40 mm and above, the only\nobservable difference being the reduced size of the vortices in Gloucester Place and upwind, in\nMarylebone Road. The latter was also shifted somewhat towards the centre of the intersection.\n3.3 Flow in vertical planes\nThe observed flow patterns in a vertical section close to the centre of Marylebone Road showed\na strong vertical motion on the upwind side of the intersection, confirming what had previously\nbeen deduced. However, vertical motion was much reduced from approximately the intersec-\ntion centre on (see figure 2, bottom-left). Intermittent small vortices could be seen in proximity\nto the centre of the intersection. The vertical flows observed in the central section were also\nseen in the vertical section on the south side. The chief difference was that these were confined\nto a smaller region in the upwind area of the intersection.\n6\nFigure 2: Still 1 (top-left): source at Gloucester Place (centre), horizontal light sheet at 20\nmm in Marylebone Road showing vortex at the south-east corner of the intersection; still 2\n(top-right): source at Marylebone Road (south), horizontal light sheet at 25 mm in Marylebone\nRoad showing intermittent vortex at the south-west corner of the intersection; still 3 (bottom-\nleft): source at Marylebone Road (centre), vertical light sheet in Marylebone Road (centre)\nshowing the vertical motion of the smoke across the intersection and along Marylebone Road;\nstill 4 (bottom-right); source at Gloucester Place (west), vertical light sheet in Gloucester Place\n(centre) showing the vertical motion of the smoke across the intersection\n7\nIn Gloucester Place (figure 2, bottom-right), unlike Marylebone Road, vertical motions\nwere observed mainly in the downwind half or the intersection.\n3.4 Discussion\nMost of the analysis of the flow visualisation experiments was made by using the video record-\nings. The still pictures captured and presented here are useful for highlighting features of the\nflow, but most of the deductions made in the previous paragraphs, and in the following discus-\nsion, can be appreciated only by watching the videos. For this purpose, some selected video\nclips (see clips 1, 2 and 3) have been provided as electronic supplementary material accompa-\nnying this article.\nAnalysis of the video recordings suggests that the flow inside the intersection can be divided\nin two different zones, one with a prevalence of near two-dimensional (horizontal) flow, and\none with a more complex three-dimensional flow (localised mainly at the west and north-west\nsections of the intersection).\nThe main observed characteristics of the flow can be then summarised as follows:\n\u2022 The main flow from Marylebone Road (west) is highly turbulent, three-dimensional\nand complex. It is mainly deflected upwards by the incoming flow from Gloucester\nPlace, continuing into Marylebone Road (east), or deflected directly into Gloucester\nPlace (north). For example, see clip 1 from the electronic supplementary material.\n\u2022 Intermittently flow from Marylebone Road recirculates in a small vortex at the south-west\ncorner of the intersection. This feature can be clearly seen in clip 1 as well.\n\u2022 The flow from Gloucester Place is mostly entrained into Marylebone Road, forming a\nlarge recirculation vortex at the south side of the street. A significant fraction of the flow\nis deflected upwards and continues northbound at a higher level. See clips 1, 2 and 3.\n\u2022 Intermittently the flow recirculates in the small horizontal vortex at the south-west corner\nof the intersection (see above) or vertically in vortices at the centre of the intersection.\nSee clips 1 and 3.\nThe next objective was to move to quantitative measurements using laser Doppler anemom-\netry.\n4 Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA)\n4.1 Experimental strategy\nLaser Doppler anemometry tests were performed in order to give a quantitative assessment\nof the observed flow within the Gloucester Place\/Marylebone Road intersection. LDA is a\nnon-intrusive optical method for measuring flow velocity based on the Doppler effect. The\nDoppler effect is the change of frequency observed whenever a source of light (or any type\nof wave) moves relative to a stationary observer. The change in frequency (\u2018Doppler shift\u2019) is\nproportional to the velocity of the moving source. A fibre-optic LDA system was used, with the\nfinal optical head being a 20 mm diameter cylinder, 150 mm long and the measurement volume\n50 mm in front of the head.\n8\nFigure 3: Locations of the three-minute average LDA vertical profiles\nThree-dimensional LDA measurements were performed over the whole intersection. Con-\nsidering the intersection as the origin of the coordinate system with the x axis along Marylebone\nRoad and the Y axis along Gloucester Place, the area covered by measurements was the region\n\u2212300 mm < x < 300 mm, \u2212300 mm < y < 300mm and 25 mm < z < 150 mm. The mea-\nsurement grid consisted of 31 x 31 x 6 points, spaced 20 mm along x and y and 25 mm along\nz.\nIn order to obtain the three velocity components over the whole area, the (head) probe of\nthe two-component LDA system was employed in three different positions. Given the size and\nshape of the probe, some measurement positions in the street and close to the buildings were\nnot feasible.\nThe three components of velocity were measured at almost all locations over a period of\none minute for each point. The result is a complete three-dimensional mapping of the area.\nMean and root-mean-square (rms) velocities, turbulent kinetic energy, vorticity, streamlines\nand Reynolds shear stresses were obtained from the analysis of the data. Furthermore, 14\npoints were chosen (see the map in figure 3) where velocity was measured along a vertical\nprofile from z = 25 mm to z = 350 mm with an averaging time of 3 minutes. This became a\nmore accurate evaluation of the velocity statistics by reducing the uncertainty in the 1 minute-\naverage due to the low frequency fluctuations in the flow. Results from the LDA experiments\nare presented in non-dimensional form, using the reference wind tunnel speed, Ure f , measured\nabove the boundary layer as the velocity scale.\n4.2 Velocity and turbulence fields within the intersection\nSelected vector plots of the non-dimensional horizontal and vertical velocity fields are shown\nin figures 4 and 5.\nThese results confirm findings from the flow visualisation experiments. In particular, the\ntwo main horizontal recirculation vortices can be clearly seen in Marylebone Road (south-east)\n9\nFigure 4: Horizontal velocity field at z = 25 mm (top-left), z = 50 mm (top-right), z = 75 mm\n(bottom-left) and z = 150 mm (bottom-right); mean building height = 110 mm\nand Gloucester Place (north-west). At a greater height, the flow and the turbulence field is\nincreasingly dominated by the above roof wind and by the wake of the towers on the WCC\nbuilding and Marathon House. Since the measures are averaged over one minute, they do\nnot give reliable information about some intermittent characteristics observed in the flow vi-\nsualisation experiments, such as the small recirculation vortex at the south-west corner of the\nintersection.\nThe most interesting characteristics of the vertical flow are shown in the Marylebone Road\nsections (e.g. see figure 5), because of its greater cross-section. Two main clockwise vortices\ncan be observed in the sections upwind of the intersection (a smaller counter clockwise vortex\nmay also exist but is not visible in the figures). Further downwind (x = 260 mm, , approximately\na street width from the intersection; see figure 5-bottom) the behaviour tends to be more like\nthat of a classic street canyon flow field, with a large clockwise recirculation vortex.\nThe turbulent kinetic energy could be calculated at most measurements points, where all\nthree velocity components were available. In a non-dimensional form, turbulent kinetic energy,\n10\nFigure 5: Vertical velocity fields in the y\u2212 z plane; top: across Marylebone Road, west (x =\n\u2212160 mm; \u201cyz-1\u201d); centre: along Gloucester Place (x = 20 mm; \u201cyz-2\u201d); bottom: across\nMarylebone Road, east (x = 260 mm; \u201cyz-3\u201d)\n11\nFigure 6: Contours of turbulent kinetic energy in vertical sections at y = 0 mm (top: x\u2212z plane,\nalong Marylebone Road), and at x = 20 mm (bottom: y\u2212 z plane, along Gloucester Place)\ne\u2032, can be defined as:\ne\u2032 =\n\u3008u\u2032\u30092 + \u3008v\u2032\u30092 + \u3008w\u2032\u30092\n2\n(1)\nwhere u\u2032 = u\/Ure f , v\u2032 = v\/Ure f , w\u2032 = w\/Ure f are the non-dimensional velocity fluctuations\n(i.e. the turbulent components) along, respectively, x, y and z.\nSome of the results are shown in figure 6.\nAnalysis of the figures for the lower levels reveals a highly turbulent area in Marylebone\nRoad, upwind from the intersection, and also in the north-west corner of the intersection. A\nregion of relatively low turbulence levels can be seen on the south-east side, with the position of\nthe large recirculation vortex clearly visible. This behaviour is in full agreement with the flow\nvisualisation. At higher levels, at and above roof level, the turbulence field is mainly influenced\nby the presence of the towers on the WCC and Marathon House buildings. Vertical sections\n(figure 6) show peaks in the turbulence levels located approximately at the building roof height.\nSince the building geometry is very heterogeneous, the height of these turbulence peaks is also\nvery variable.\nThe construction of streamlines, or stream traces, provides a powerful analysis tool that\nis made possible by the availability of the three-dimensional flow measurements. The stream\ntraces (derived by use of the open-source software ParaView 3.2.1) generally confirmed the\nprevious analysis. The added capability of this form of analysis is the possibility to visualise\nthree-dimensional patterns, as opposed to light sheet flow visualisation and LDA vector plots\n12\nFigure 7: Stream traces for the flow field at the lowest levels. Starting points for both forward\nand backward traces are on the diagonal line from north-west to south-east across the inter-\nsection at z = 25 mm. Traces terminate when outside of the measurement domain: \u2212300 mm\n< x,y< 300 mm, 25 mm < z< 150 mm\nwhich give a two-dimensional view. This made it possible to highlight other interesting features\nof the studied flow (see figures 7-8).\nFigure 7 shows some interesting characteristics of the flow at the lowest levels by the ter-\nmination of the traces. This implies that the flow is directed to, or comes from, areas beyond\nthe boundaries of the measurement grid (e.g. the lowest level, at 25 mm in this case). Most of\nthe flow at the intersection appears to be directed slightly upwards and, at this level, is mainly\nentrained into Marylebone Road, as already pointed out. Further from the intersection the\nstreamlines are again directed downwards and the flow is most probably channelled into the\nstreet that runs parallel to Gloucester Place (Glentworth Street). On the other hand, the flow\nfield near the north-west and south-east corners of the intersection is directed slightly down-\nwards. This figure reveals a limitation of the LDA measurements, as the flow field below 25\nmm (5 m at full scale) is completely unknown and this may greatly affect the possibility of\nperforming accurate flux balances around the intersection (as this is a region of the flow where\nvelocity and turbulence gradients are large).\nOther characteristics are highlighted by figure 8. The substantial geometrical variability\nof this real urban intersection leads to a strong interaction between the canopy flow and the\nabove-canopy flow. This is a quite different situation than that found with an ideal symmetric\n13\nFigure 8: Stream traces for the flow field at the intermediate levels. Starting points for both\nforward and backward traces are on the diagonal line from north-west to south-east across the\nintersection at z = 50 mm.

The profiles cover the mean and rms velocities and the Reynolds\nshear stresses. Near-classical street canyon behaviour can be seen at points in Gloucester Place\nupwind (at L and also N, not reported in the figures) and downwind (at C and also B, not re-\nported in the figures) of the intersection, where the street canyon is narrower. However, the\npeaks in turbulence intensity at roof level are relatively weak because of the variable building\nheights. The influence of the buildings extends to higher levels than in simple geometries for\nthe same reason. Similar behaviour can be also observed in the most easterly point in Maryle-\nbone Road (i.e. at point I). This point confirms, for this real situation, the findings of Xie et al.\n(2008) in the context of a generic randomised height geometry.\nA more complex pattern is observed within the intersection and also in the upwind part\nof Marylebone Road. The influence of relatively tall upwind buildings can be seen in the\nvertical profiles. A \u2018double\u2019 adjustment in the vertical velocity profile is evident at points D\nand H in figure 10 and G in figure 9 (similar profiles were also obtained at points E and F).\nThe first adjustment level corresponds to the roof level of the WCC building (75 mm) and\nthe second to the height of the WCC tower (170 mm). This is also clearly visible in the rms\nand Reynolds shear stress profiles, where a double peak can be observed and relatively high\nvalues are maintained from the roof level to the WCC tower height. This behaviour is even\nmore marked at points K and J, (located in the wake of the WCC building) and analysed in the\nfollowing section.\n4.3 Influence of tall buildings\nAs highlighted by the analysis presented in the previous section, high-rise buildings exert a\nstrong influence on the flow and turbulence fields in the vicinity of the street intersection and\nare areas where vertical exchanges might be concentrated. Figure 11 (top-left) shows a vector\nplot of the horizontal velocity field, together with a contour plot of the vertical velocity field,\ndownwind of the tower on Marathon House.\nThe figure highlights the complex three-dimensional flow field in the wake of such a tower.\nIn the region mapped the approach flow is directed downwards in much the near wake, but with\nsome upward flow on the north side. In contrast, upwards flow dominates further downwind.\nThe resulting x-vorticity component is shown in figure 11 (bottom), making clear the large scale\nswirling motion responsible for the pattern seen in figure 11 (top-right).\nThis feature of the flow is particularly strong near roof level, and it will clearly affect the\nvertical exchange mechanisms between the street canopy and the flow above roof level, a matter\nof great importance for dispersion models at this particular scale. As highlighted by figure 11\n(top-right), a strong influence on the roof level flow is also exerted by the smaller tower on\nthe WCC building, even though its effects seem to by mainly in the horizontal, particularly\naffecting the lateral mixing processes.\nFurther evidence on the strong influence of the taller buildings on the vertical exchange\nmechanisms can be found by analysing vertical profiles at points placed within the wake of the\nbuildings and the towers (see figure 12).\nThe vertical profile at point M (in the wake of building 7 but with no taller upwind buildings)\nshows a large variation in mean velocity at a height that corresponds to the upwind roof level\n15\nFigure 9: Vertical profiles of velocity (top), rms turbulence intensity (centre) and Reynolds\nshear stresses (bottom) along Gloucester Place (at points L, G and C shown in figure 3)\n16\nFigure 10: Vertical profiles of velocity (top), rms turbulence intensity (centre) and Reynolds\nshear stresses (bottom) along Marylebone Road (at points D, H and I shown in figure 3). Note\nthat point G, shown in figure 3 is part of the sequence\n17\nFigure 11: Top-left: vertical (contour plot) and horizontal (vector plot) flow fields in wake of\nthe Marathon House tower at a height of z = 150 mm; top-right: horizontal (z) vorticity at z =\n125 mm (contour plot) and horizontal velocity field (vector plot); bottom: vertical (x) vorticity\nat x=\u2212300 mm (contour plot) and vertical (y\u2212 z) velocity field (vector plot)\n18\nFigure 12: Vertical profiles in the wake zones (points M, K and A in figure 3); velocities (top)\nand rms (bottom)\n19\n(\u223c115 mm). There is also a peak in the turbulence profiles at this height. Vertical exchanges\nare mostly confined to the shear layer at roof level. The situation of point K, in the wake of both\nthe WCC building and its tower, is substantially different. A double step is clearly visible in the\nvertical velocity profiles, corresponding to both the WCC building roof level and tower height,\nwith turbulence levels remaining high throughout the whole layer between the two. Similar,\nthough less pronounced behaviour is seen at points G, F and H further downwind. The mean\nflow in the wake of the WCC tower tends to remain mostly horizontal, as observed previously,\nbut all three turbulence components are relatively large. Point A reveals a slightly different\nbehaviour. Again, the two turbulence peaks are observable in this case but the intensities are\nsignificantly reduced in the layer between the peaks. Clearly, the influence of the Marathon\nHouse tower at A can be characterised as a building near-wake, as opposed to the WCC tower\nwhich is best represented as creating a strong wake-like disturbance. The near-wake sheltering\neffect is clearly visible in the mean velocity profiles, in a substantial layer between the level of\nthe Marathon House roof and tower top where velocities approach zero. Above the tower roof\nlevel, the vertical velocity profiles adjust again to match the external wind field, with a large\nlocal gradient.\n4.4 Discussion\nThe LDA experiments clearly confirm that the \u2018average\u2019 characteristics observed by flow visu-\nalisation, although no further information about the intermittent behaviour previously identified\nhas been obtained from the experiments.\nThe mean flow shows a rather complex behaviour across the whole area. Recirculation vor-\ntices were observed in a number different locations, though some were not that well defined and\ntended to merge into the along-street component of the flow. This is rather important because\nthe wind is directed approximately 51o relative to Marylebone road and therefore the x and y\ncomponents are similar in magnitude. Generally, the flow in Gloucester Place near the intersec-\ntion appears to be almost two-dimensional with an almost zero vertical component, although\nfurther from the intersection classical canyon vortex flows were identified. The patterns change\nin the region near and above roof level, as wakes and vortices from upwind structures interact\nquite strongly. The asymmetric configuration of the building geometry plays an important role\nin defining the mean and turbulent flow for z > 75 mm almost everywhere in the area. The\nmean flow along Marylebone Road is much more complex. Flow approaching the intersection\nfrom upwind (x < 0) in the lower part of the street canyon is generally deflected upwards in\ncrossing the intersection, then downwards again, in part in Gloucester Place (north) and in part\nin Marylebone Road (east).\nMeasurements could not be taken closer to the surface than z = 25 mm but data from this\nlevel show significant downward components (i.e. towards the ground) in some areas and an\nupward components in others. This implies that the flow very close to the ground could be\nrather complex and that further measurements might well be needed (e.g. to enable flux bal-\nances to be calculated). The mean flow in Marylebone Road downwind of the intersection is\nfully three-dimensional, with vortices from the building on the lower-right corner of the in-\ntersection interacting with the down-flow coming from the upper levels of Marylebone Road\n(west). Nevertheless, in this region the recirculation vortices are clearly visible and the flow\nbegins to assume a more \u201cclassical\u201d canyon-style structure.\nAs observed in the flow visualisation experiments, this \u2018average\u2019 behaviour often breaks\n20\ndown. In such circumstances, a large part of the flow then passes northwards along Gloucester\nPlace, creating some small recirculation regions at the west side of the intersection, both to the\nsouth of the intersection (in Marylebone Road) and to the north (in Gloucester Place).\nThe geometrical characteristics of the site (notably, towers and tall buildings) impose a very\nstrong influence of the flow, causing the development of extensive recirculation areas, vertical\nexchanges and mixing in the wake. For example, the tower above the WCC building, despite\nits relatively small dimensions, exerts a strong influence over a large area of the intersection,\nmainly at z> 75 mm.\nThe analysis of the Reynolds stresses shows that the boundary layer might be affected by\nthe buildings up to heights of about z = 350 mm, which is more than two times the height of the\ntallest building at the intersection. This effect is no doubt influenced by the two towers, though\nfurther analysis is needed. Nevertheless, the profiles show peaks at the level of the building\nroofs, which suggests that much of the turbulence is produced there.\n4.5 Quality assessment and datasets\nThe LDA experiments were preceded by a series of preliminary measurements to optimise the\nexperimental procedures; e.g. to determine the required averaging time. Preliminary runs and\ncomparisons with a previous set of LDA data suggested that an ideal averaging time would\nbe about 5 minutes. Nevertheless, as we were planning to perform a complete, detailed three-\ndimensional mapping of the velocity field at the intersection, and considering the number of\nmeasurement points, it was decided to use one minute averages over the whole intersection and\nadd some more accurate three minute averages as vertical profiles.\nError estimation was performed by using a 60-minute run of data, applying different aver-\naging procedures and comparing subsequent results to the full 60-minute average. In this way,\nthe error in one minute averages was found to be \u00b19.6% for the U component and \u00b114.4% for\ntheV component; for three-minute averages, the corresponding errors were\u00b13.2% and\u00b15.9%\nand for five-minute averages \u00b12.9% and \u00b14.5%.\nDue to the long duration of the LDA experiments (each being several hours in duration), it\nwas decided not to repeat any of the vertical or horizontal section measurements for the purpose\nof testing their repeatability. Instead, most of the measurement positions in the vertical sections\n(i.e. the x\u2212z or y\u2212z planes) were purposely located at the same points where horizontal section\nmeasurements were also made (i.e. in the x\u2212y plane) and these \u2018duplicate\u2019 measurements were\nthen compared. The difference between such measures was within\u00b110% for the great majority\nof points, and within \u00b130% for nearly all cases. Of course, the fine spatial grid provided a\nfurther consistency check on the data.\n5 Conclusions\nWind tunnel experiments were performed on a 1:200 scale model of a central London site,\nwith particular focus on a busy street canyon intersection, in the framework of the DAPPLE\nproject. Both qualitative flow visualisation techniques and LDA measurements were applied in\norder to describe the complex three-dimensional flow field in this real environment. The large\nexperimental database that was compiled is summarised in table 1.\n21\nTable 1: Summary of the experiments performed and available data.

Com-\nplex three-dimensional flows were observed, particularly in the \u2018upwind\u2019 sections of the inter-\nsection, where three different fluxes (from Gloucester Place, Marylebone Road, and from the\nabove-canopy flow) interacted. This behaviour cannot be correctly reproduced by current state-\nof-the-art street canyon and urban dispersion models, which have mostly a two-dimensional\napproach. The analysis of the video records from the flow visualisation experiments pointed\nout another important characteristic: intermittently, the average flow conditions were strongly\nperturbed for a limited period of time, with the associated formation of transient recirculations\nand changes in the flow paths. This effect could lead to a significant modification to the dis-\ntribution of pollutants at the intersection and hence the components of any pollutant mass flux\nbalance. Therefore, the phenomenon should be further investigated in order to develop reliable\ndispersion models for similar complex situations.\nThe LDA measurements confirmed the qualitative analysis performed with the flow visu-\nalisation technique, although no information about the intermittent behaviour was obtained.\nMeasurements were performed over the whole intersection area, with a high resolution grid,\nfor all three components of velocity and turbulence field. This allowed the production of a\nvery detailed map of the flow field and the generation of stream traces. In comparison with the\nclassical, ideal street canyon intersection behaviour these maps sow how in this complex but\nreal situation some details of the upwind flow, such as the wakes from two tall towers, play an\nimportant role in defining the flow field within the intersection, particularly at roof level. These\neffects are likely to influence strongly the mass exchange mechanism between the canopy flow\nand the air aloft, and therefore the distribution of pollutants. The particularly asymmetric ge-\nometry of the area studied enhances the interaction of the canopy flow with flow above roof\nlevel, unlike the situation with the classic, ideal street canyon flow, where this interaction is\nweak and models usually consider the two flows separately.\nA mass flux balance for the intersection could be attempted using this data set, especially\nin conjunction with tracer concentration measurements. However, despite the high resolution\nof the data, the main restriction on doing so is that the lowest measurement points were located\nat z = 25 mm (that is 5 m at full scale). Neglecting the details of the flow field below this\nheight, which are likely to be quite complex, may well introduce significant errors into any flux\ncalculations.\nAcknowledgements\nThe DAPPLE project has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (EPSRC).
