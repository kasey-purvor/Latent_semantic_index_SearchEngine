Introduction \n 2 \nIt is well known that chaotic behaviors may occur in the second-order digital \nfilters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic [Chua, 1988, 1990a; Galias, 1992; Wu, 1993; \nKocarev, 1993, 1996; Yu, 2001; Ling, 2003b, 2003e, 2003f, 2003g, 2003h, 2003i], \nsaturation-type arithmetic [Galias, 1990; Ling 2003c] and quantization-type arithmetic \n[Lin, 1991; Ling, 2003a]. Similar behaviors may also occur in third-order digital filters \nwith two\u2019s complement arithmetic [Chua, 1990b; Ling, 2002, 2003d]. \nTo analyze the chaotic behaviors of the second-order digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic, the periodicity and admissibility of the symbolic sequences \nwere investigated [Chua, 1988, 1990a; Galias, 1992; Wu, 1993; Kocarev, 1993, 1996; \nYu, 2001; Ling, 2003d, 2003e, 2003f, 2003g, 2003h, 2003i]. \nHowever, the effects of the state trajectory behaviors at different filter \nparameters on the statistical properties of the symbolic sequences and the state \nvariables of these systems have not yet been investigated. Since the state variables will \nconverge to zero and no overflow will occur if both the eigenvalues of the second-\norder digital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic are real and inside the unit circle, \nthe Shannon entropies of the symbolic sequences are therefore zero. When the \neigenvalues are complex and inside or on the unit circle, three types of trajectories are \nexhibited on the phase portraits [Chua, 1988, 1990a; Galias, 1992; Wu, 1993; Kocarev, \n1993, 1996; Yu, 2001; Ling, 2002, 2003a, 2003d, 2003e, 2003g, 2003h]. The type of \ntrajectories depends on the filter parameters and the initial conditions of the filters. It is \nfound that the symbolic sequences are constant if the system exhibits the type I \ntrajectory. Hence, the Shannon entropies of the symbolic sequences are zero for the \ntype I trajectory. But what are the related results for the type II and type III \ntrajectories? Since the type III trajectory exhibits chaotic fractal patterns on the phase \nportraits and the symbolic sequences are aperiodic, in contrast to the type II trajectory \nwhich only exhibits limit cycle behaviors and the symbolic sequences are periodic, one \nmay expect that the Shannon entropies of the symbolic sequences for the type III \ntrajectory may be higher than that for the type II trajectory. But is this intuitive \nimplication true? Moreover, it is well known that when both the eigenvalues are \noutside the unit circle, random-like chaotic patterns are typically exhibited all over the \nphase portraits. One may ask: are there any exceptional cases? If yes, what are the \nShannon entropies of the state variables at these filter parameter values? What features \nwill such phase portraits exhibit? \n 3 \nThe organization of this letter is shown as the following. The system is first \ndescribed in section 2, followed by the simulation results in section 3. Finally, a \nconclusion is given in section 4. \n \n2.  System description \nAssume a second-order digital filter with two\u2019s complement arithmetic is realized \nin direct form. The system block diagram is shown in figure 1.

Simulation results \nWhen both the eigenvalues of the second-order digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic are outside the unit circle, we found that the Shannon entropies \nof the state variables are independent of the initial conditions and the filter parameters, \nexcept for some special values of a  and b . At these special values of a  and b , the \nShannon entropies of the state variables are relatively small. To demonstrate this \nphenomenon, initial conditions are generated randomly and the Shannon entropies of \nthe state variables are shown in figure 2. \nOne may expect that there are random-like chaotic patterns exhibited all over \nthe phase portraits if both the eigenvalues of the second-order digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic are outside the unit circle, as shown in figure 3a. What features \nwill the phase portraits exhibit if the filters are operating at these special filter \nparameter values? We conducted extensive simulations and found that the state \ntrajectories either exhibit random-like chaotic behaviors in some local regions or \nconverge to some fixed points on the phase portraits, as shown in figure 3b and 3c, \nrespectively. \n\uf028 \uf029\uf0b7f  \nDelay \nDelay \na\n \nb\n \n\uf028 \uf029kx1  \n\uf028 \uf029kx2\n 5 \nFigure 2: Shannon entropies of the state variables at different filter parameters when \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n5377.0\n9003.0\n0x . \n \nFigure 3: (a) Phase portraits of a second-order digital filter with two\u2019s complement \narithmetic when \uf028 \uf029 \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n5377.0\n9003.0\n0x , 2.4\uf03da  and 6.4\uf03db . \nEn\ntro\npy\n o\nf x\n(k\n) \n 6 \n \nFigure 3: (b) Phase portraits of a second-order digital filter with two\u2019s complement \narithmetic when \uf028 \uf029 \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n5377.0\n9003.0\n0x , 1.0\uf02d\uf03da  and 6.1\uf02d\uf03db . \n \nFigure 3: (c) State trajectories of a second-order digital filter with two\u2019s complement \narithmetic when \uf028 \uf029 \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n5377.0\n9003.0\n0x , 4\uf02d\uf03da  and 4\uf02d\uf03db . \n 7 \nWhen a  and b  are multiples of 2 , the phase portraits will converge to some \nfixed points and the Shannon entropies of the state variables are relatively small. To \nunderstand this phenomenon, we model the filtering process as the sum of Bernoulli \nshift operations. Since only a finite number of bits represent a number in the existing \ndigital circuits, the initial condition can be represented in a binary form with a finite \nnumber of bits as follows: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d\nN\nn\nn\nnpx\n1\n1 20  (9) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d\nN\nn\nn\nnqx\n1\n2 20  (10) \nwhere \uf07b \uf07d1,0, \uf0cenn qp  for Nn ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d  (11) \nand N  is the number of bits, not including the sign bit, for representing a number in \nthese digital circuits. \nSince a  and b  are even numbers, we can let: \n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf0d7\uf03d\nM\nn\nn\nna\n1\n2\uf061  (12) \n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf0d7\uf03d\nM\nn\nn\nnb\n1\n2\uf062  (13) \nwhere \uf07b \uf07d1,0, \uf0cenn \uf062\uf061  for Mn ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d  (14) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0d7\uf03d\uf0d7 \uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nN\nn\nn\nn\nM\nn\nn\nn pxb\n11\n1 220 \uf062  (15) \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0a2\uf03d \uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nN\njn\nnj\nn\nM\nj\nj ps\n11\n2\uf062  (16) \nwhere \uf07b \uf07d0\uf055\uf02b\uf0ce\uf0a2 Zs  (17) \nSince the summation of njnp\n\uf02d\uf0d72  in \uf0e5\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf0d7\nN\njn\nnj\nnp\n1\n2  is from 2\uf03dn  to Nn \uf03d , the \nmost significant bit is absorbed in s\uf0a2  after the first iteration, and all the bits will vanish \nafter N  iterations. Therefore, the state trajectories will eventually converge to some \nfixed points on the phase portraits, and no overflow will occur after N  iterations and \n\uf028 \uf029 0\uf03dks  for Nk \uf0b3 . Hence, the Shannon entropies of the state variables for these \nspecial filter parameters are relatively small. \nFor other special values of the filter parameters, such as when 1.0\uf02d\uf03da  and \n 8 \n6.1\uf02d\uf03db , we found that there are chaotic state trajectory patterns exhibited in some \nlocal regions on the phase plane. The question is: how to figure out these special filter \nparameter values? We suggest that if the Shannon entropies of the state variables are \nrelatively small, then the corresponding filter parameters may be the special ones that \nexhibit some special types of state trajectories on the phase plane. \nFor completeness, we extend the investigation to the second-order digital filters \nwith two\u2019s complement arithmetic with their eigenvalues being complex and inside or \non the unit circle. Different types of trajectories of the filter at different initial \nconditions and the Shannon entropies of the symbolic sequences are shown in figures \n4a and 4b, respectively. \n \n 9 \n \nFigure 4: (a) Set of initial conditions for different types of trajectories when 1\uf02d\uf03db  \nand 5.0\uf03da . (b) Shannon entropies of symbolic sequences for different initial \nconditions when 1\uf02d\uf03db  and 5.0\uf03da . \nIt can be seen from figure 4 that the Shannon entropies of the symbolic \nsequences for the type II trajectory may be higher than that for the type III trajectory, \neven though the symbolic sequences of the type II trajectory are periodic and have \nlimit cycle behaviors, while that of the type III trajectory are aperiodic and have \nchaotic behaviors. So it is hard to determine the type of trajectories with the Shannon \nentropies alone, when the eigenvalues are complex and inside or on the unit circle. \n \n4.  Conclusion \nIn this letter, we investigated the Shannon entropies of the symbolic sequences \nand the state variables of the second-order digital filters with two\u2019s complement \narithmetic for a variety of filter parameters. We conducted extensive simulations and \nfound that when the eigenvalues of the second-order digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic are complex and inside or on the unit circle, the Shannon \nentropies of the symbolic sequences for the type II trajectory may be higher than that \nfor the type III trajectory. When both the eigenvalues of the second-order digital filters \nwith two\u2019s complement arithmetic are outside the unit circle, the Shannon entropies of \n 10 \nthe state variables are almost constant and independent of the initial conditions and the \nfilter parameters, except for some special filter parameter values. In these special cases, \nthe state trajectories either exhibit random-like chaotic behaviors in some local regions \nor converge to fixed points on the phase portraits. In this letter, we suggest to use \nShannon entropies to detect these filter parameters. \n \nAcknowledgement \n The work described in this letter was substantially supported partially from a \nstudentship and partially from a research grant (G-YD26) of the Hong Kong \nPolytechnic University. \n \nReferences \n[1] Chua, L.
