Introduction\nSolvent extraction is a promising technology for the treatment of oil contaminated\nsoil, in which petroleum hydrocarbons are removed from soil using an individual\nsolvent or mixture of solvents [1]. Typically, solvents used within this field include\nexhaustive organic solvents [2, 3], surfactant aid aqueous solution[4], non-toxic and\nbiodegradable agents [5, 6], and supercritical [7] and subcritical fluids [8]. A great\ndeal of research on the development of composite solvents for removing PAH from\nsoil has been carried out. However, most of the studies were conducted at laboratory\nscale and the high performances of extraction reported were achieved in controlled\nconditions such as extraction temperature ranging between 70 and 100 \uf0b0C. In\naddition, previous studies on the characterisation of natural soil organic matter (SOM)\ndemonstrated that component molecules of SOM can be altered [9] and transitions\nbetween the glassy and rubber phase of soil can occur by the addition of heat[10]. To\nthe best of our knowledge, few extractions with high efficiency have been performed\nat room temperature and the issue of energy cost needed should be taken into account\nfor implementing this technology at field scale. Additionally, the extraction time\nreported varied greatly ranging from 30 min to 48 h [3, 4, 11, 12] and comparison\nunder the same conditions should be performed to determine if solvent extraction can\nremove contaminants faster than other technologies. Hence, there is an increasing\ndemand for extraction with less energy consuming and faster mass transfer rate.\n4The problem of secondary pollution needs also to be addressed as some of the\nsolvents used may persist in the remediated soil and pose an environmental risk due to\ntheir low biodegradability. Most of the studies have focused on the extraction\nefficiency, but less attention was paid to the solvent regeneration. Some investigations\nhave been conducted on the recovery of solvent from the extracted oil; for instance,\nthe surfactant and vegetable oil were regenerated by activated carbon adsorption[4,\n13], acetone and ethyl acetate were regenerated by distillation [2] and cyclodextrin\nwas reused by liquid-liquid extraction [14]. However, very limited information was\nfound for regenerating the residual solvent in the soil as it is difficult to recover its\noriginal properties for purpose of reusing. To handle the issue of liquid-solid\nseparation, Soxhlet and solid phase extraction are alternative techniques, but both are\ntime consuming and generate secondary pollution since organic solvents are used.\nEvaporation and centrifugation are effective approaches and avoid the problem of\nsecondary pollution, but they are energy intensive or inapplicable for the inflammable\nand explosive solvents. These challenges raise the demand for developing simple\ncost-effective techniques and alternative approaches promoting use of green\nchemistry in order to recycle and reuse organic solvents.\nIn our previous research [15], the TU-A solvent, an organic composite solvent\nconsisting of hexane and pentane (4:1 v\/v) was used for extracting total petroleum\nhydrocarbons (TPH) from a contaminated soil in which the initial TPH concentration\nranged between 0.1 and 0.14 g g-1 d.w. soil. After solvent extraction at a soil-solvent\n5ratio of 1:4 (w\/w), the TPH removal efficiency after 5 and 15 min at room\ntemperature was 80% and 95% respectively, and the concentration of the composite\nsolvent remaining in the soil was between 330 and 660 mg g-1. Two conclusions were\nreached in these preliminary results: (i) solvent extraction using TU-A solvent is a\npromising technique for removing petroleum hydrocarbons from soil which is fast and\neffective; (ii) the amount of solvent remaining in soil may pose an environmental risk\nand prevent its use at industrial scale without recycling.\nWater is perceived as \u2018the ultimate green solvent\u2019, cheap, non-toxic and recyclable. Its\ndisposal is regarded as benign with little affect on the environment [16]. In this work,\nwater was proposed as a carrier to decontaminate soil from the residual organic\nsolvent. The hypothesis was that the TU-A solvent (nonpolar molecules) distributed in\nthe micro pores in soil would transfer from solid phase to water phase in the presence\nof concentration gradient, entered spaces between water clusters and associated with\neach other (rather than with the water molecules) in the void spaces. Both water and\norganic solvent were reused after separation by density differences. Therefore, the\nspecific objectives of this study were: (i) to assess the feasibility of the water washing\ntechnology for recycling organic solvent, (ii) to identify the factors influencing\nwashing efficiency and optimize washing conditions, and (iii) to provide information\nfor implementing a robust remediation methodology associated with solvent\nextraction.\n62. Materials and methods\n2.1. Chemicals and soils\nHexane, pentane and tetrachloromethane (CCl4) were purchased from Tianjin\nJiangtian Technology Co. Ltd., China. TU-A solvent was a mixture of hexane and\npentane (4:1 v\/v). All the solvents used were analytical grade.\nThe uncontaminated soil used was obtained from a typical oil field in China.\nPhysicochemical properties of the soil were as follows: pH: 8.0, SOM: 0.7%, cation\nexchange capacity: 164.0 mmol\u00b7kg-1, moisture content: 1.7%, bulk density: 1.4 g\u00b7cm-3,\nand tap density: 2.8 g\u00b7cm-3. The fraction of clay, sand and silt was 25.3%, 40.4% and\n34.3%, respectively. The soil was air-dried and homogenised by screening through a\n2-mm sieve to remove extra vegetable roots and stored in glass desiccators before use.\n2.2. Optimization of water washing condition\nThe water washing conditions were optimized using multifactor orthogonal\nexperiment followed by single factor experiment. Previous studies on the soil washing\nusing aqueous surfactant solution demonstrated that the factors largely influencing the\nwashing efficiency were water volume, water temperature, washing time and initial\nconcentration of solvent [12]. In this study, the four parameters were studied at three\nlevels using L9 (34) orthogonal array as shown in Table 1. In conventional full\nfactorial experimental design, the number of experiments required to run is 34 = 81,\nwhich was reduced to 9 by orthogonal design, offering a great advantage in terms of\nexperimental time and cost. Three statistical coefficients (K, R and F-ratio) were used\n7to evaluate the orthogonal data. K is the sum of the concentrations of residual solvent\nextraction mixture in soils for each impact factor at each level, which was used to\nassess the optimal level of each factor so as to determine the optimum combination of\nthe experimental condition. The lowest the K value, the highest solvent removal\nefficiency of the factor considered is. The extreme difference R is a parameter\nrepresenting the fluctuation degree of the washing efficiency in accordance with the\nvariety level of impact factor. The larger the R value, the more obvious influence of\nthe corresponding factor is. F-ratio was applied to evaluate whether the impact factors\nwere statistically significant or not, which was calculated using the method previously\ndescribed by Gonder et al [17] and then compared with the critical F value which\ncould be found in most of the statistics and experimental design books [18].\nBriefly soil samples (20 g) were weighed into a 250 ml conical flask and different\nvolume of TU-A solvent were added to achieve the level concentration as shown in\nTable 1. The flasks were sealed, shaken manually for 5 min and stored at room\ntemperature for 15 min. Water was then added to the flask and stirred on the magnetic\nstirrer for 1, 3 and 5 min as described in Table 1. The mixture was transferred to a\nseparating funnel, in which the TU-A solvent was extracted from the soil by water.\nAfter the solvent float on the top layer, the supernatant was discarded while the\nbottom slurry was received in a beaker and analysed by ultrasonic extraction.\n82.3. Volatilization of solvent from soil\nVolatilization of TU-A solvent from soil during solvent recycling process was\nestimated by mass balance for each experiment in the L9 (34) orthogonal array.\nVolatilization during the ultrasonic extraction (section 2.5) was also considered as it\naccelerated the loss of solvent by evaporation. Therefore the overall loss of solvent by\nvolatilization equals to loss during the water washing process and the ultrasonic\nextraction. The difference between the known mass of all the materials added (i.e. 20\ng of soil, 6.6 g of solvent, 20g of water and 31.9 g of CCl4 were added in experiment\n1) and the actual overall mass measured at the end of ultrasonic extraction (i.e. 78.2 g\nin experiment 1) was estimated to be the mass loss by volatilization.\n2.4. Semi-continuous concurrent water extraction\nThe solvent extraction soil system was washed in a water wash column (Figure 1a),\nwhich was made of glass and fitted with water distribution tube, alternative water inlet\nand overflow outlet. Soils (500 g) were weighed into a 2500 ml premix bottle and 500\nml composite solvent was added. The bottle was sealed with corker stopper with\nparafilm wrapped around. The soil was saturated with solvent after sorption for 15\nmin. Water (1 L) was added followed by agitation for 5 min on a magnetic stirrer.\nThe water extraction process is shown in Figure 1b. From the top of the water wash\ncolumn, the mixture of solvent, soil and water (60 ml\u00b7s-1) was fed through a soil feed\ntube that was a glass circular tube with an inverted funnel at the end. A water\ndistribution tube that was perforated with regularly spaced holes was fitted at the\n9middle of the water wash column, through which water (16.7 ml\u00b7s-1) was fed into the\ncolumn. Three phase layers and two interfaces were formed in the column. The\nsolvent floated at the uppermost layer and overflew (5.6 ml\u00b7s-1) into the solvent\nrecycling bottle. The interface between the solvent mixture and the lower emulsion\nlayer was kept below the overflow outlet to minimize the loss of soil. The mixture of\nsoil and water was discharged at the bottom of the column and received in a slurry\ncollection bottle. Once the slurry settled, water was pumped back into the water wash\ncolumn. Since the whole system was sealed in order to reduce volatilization of the\nsolvent mixture, a connection between the premix bottle, water wash column and the\nsolvent recycling bottle was made with rubber tubes to facilitate the feed and\noverflow.\n2.5. Analytical Method\nThe concentration of residual solvent mixture in soil after water washing was\ndetermined by ultrasonic solvent extraction followed by chemical analysis on gas\nchromatography (Perkin Elmer AutoSystem GC) equipped with a flame ionization\ndetector (FID) (Figure 2). The slurry was extracted with 20 ml of CCl4 and sonicated\nfor 25 min at 20 \uf0b0C. The supernatant was decanted into a Teflon centrifuge tube. After\ncentrifugation for 5 min at 750 rpm, the supernatant was passed through a filter\ncolumn fitted with receiver tube. Extract (5 ml) was decanted into a GC vial and\nstored in darkness before GC analysis to prevent photodecomposition of CCl4. The\n10\nresidue soil after ultrasonic extraction was dried in oven for 2 h at 120 \u00baC after\nvolatilization for 24 h in a ventilating cabinet. The beaker was washed, dried and\nweighed again after discarding the dry soil.\nFor GC-FID analysis, splitless injection with a sample volume of 1 \u00b5l and the injector\ntemperature of 140 \u00baC were applied. TPH were separated on a PE-1 capillary column\n(50 m \u00d7 0.2 mm internal diameter) with nitrogen as a carrier gas. The oven\ntemperature was increased from 40 \u00baC to 75 \u00baC at 6 \u00baC min-1 and kept at this\ntemperature for 20 min. The FID was operated at 140 \u00baC. External multilevel\ncalibrations were performed using CCl4\/TU-A standards, concentration of TU-A\nranging from 0.03 to 0.21 g ml-1.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Multifactor orthogonal experiments\nThe standard orthogonal matrix for optimising the water washing conditions including\nwater volume (A), water temperature (B), washing time (C) and initial concentration\nof solvent (D) is shown in Table 2. The extreme difference analysis showed that the\nlowest K value for each impact factor was at the second level for water volume and\nthe third level for the other three factors. Therefore the optimum combination could\nbe defined as A2B3C3D3. The coefficient R values of the various parameters showed\nthe following trend: water volume > washing time > water temperature > initial\nconcentration of solvent in soil (Table 2). Water volume was the most significant\n11\nfactor that influenced efficacy of water washing at 95% confidence level with F-ratio\nof 40.51 (Table 3). In contrast, the other factors did not significantly influence the\nwashing efficiency as all F-ratio were lower than the critical F-value.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the efficiency of solvent recycling was ranging from 93% (i.e.\nexperiment 1) to 99% (i.e. experiment 7). In addition, volatilization of the TU-A\nsolvent was relatively low ranging from 0.4% (i.e. experiment 7) to 5.5% (i.e.\nexperiment 2). This finding suggests that water washing can be an efficient process\nfor removing residual solvent in soil. It also suggests that solvent extraction and\nrecycling can be repeatedly carried out if the entire system is well sealed.\n3.2. Single factor experiments\nThe effect of the most significant factor (water volume) on the washing efficiency\nwas investigated by fixing the other three factors at the optimal values. The relation\nbetween the concentrations of residual solvent extraction mixture in soil and water\nvolumes showed that the concentration of the residual solvent extraction mixture was\ndecreased to less than 2 mg g-1 when the water volume increased to 3.5 times of its\ninitial concentration (Figure 4). As expected, the concentration of residual solvent in\nsoil declined from 7.3 to 1.7 mg g-1 when the water volume was increased from 30 ml\nto 70 ml respectively. The same trends were observed in the orthogonal experiments\nwhere the value (average value of K) of the water volume dropped from 6.0 at\nlevel 1 to 1.5 at level 2 (Figure 5). However, the surprising increase of up to 2.70\n12\nwhen the water volume was at level 3 suggests that the loss of solvent results from a\nconcomitant effect of the water washing process and volatilization. This finding is\nfurther supported by the volatilization data. As shown in Figure 3, the higher the\nvolume of water, the lower the volatilisation. This can be explained by the wicking\nmechanism identified by Arthurs et al. [19, 20]. The wicking behaviour is created by\ncapillary force in the soil and occurs whenever an immiscible phase concentration\ngradient is present, which then contributes to volatilization rates. This mechanism was\nalso validated by Li et al. [21], which demonstrated that appropriate volume of water\nhelps the wicking action but also that too much water stops this mechanism. When\nlarge quantity of water exists, the water molecules prefer to take up the micro pores in\nthe soil whereas the solvent molecules in the pores of larger size [22]. The capillarity\nwas therefore weakened and the promoting of volatilization by wicking behaviour\nwas restrained. In addition, this behaviour may be interpreted by the effect of free\npores in the soil system [23, 24]. The presence of large amount of water leads to the\ndeclining of porosity factor and volatilization area, resulting in restricting of\nvolatilization rate.\nIn the semi-continuous experiments, water used for extraction consisted of three parts\nsuch as the water in the premix step, the fresh water fed into the water wash column\nand the recycled water, total volume of which depended on the initial concentration of\nTU-A solvent. Results indicated that the volume of water should be at least 3 times\ngreater than those of TU-A solvent to be regenerated (Figure 4). The concentration of\n13\nthe residual solvent extraction mixture was 15 mg g-1 after concurrent extraction in\nthe column, which was more than 1.5 times higher than the results in the orthogonal\nexperiments. This finding can be explained by the fact that the fluid-solid contact time\nin the water wash column was too short, resulting that \u2018new\u2019 fluids displaced the\nincompletely equilibrated \u2018old\u2019 fluids before mass transfer completed.\nA biphasic kinetic has been proposed previously to describe the desorption of\nhydrophobic organic solvent from the soil to the water phase [25]. Initially, a portion\nof solvent can be extracted by water very quickly (within few minutes) by\nintraparticle diffusion driven by concentration gradient, whereas the remaining\nfraction is more slowly or cannot be extracted. This suggests that solvent removal rate\nand efficiency will increase and then reach a plateau as water volume increases. No\nsuch trend was observed in this study suggesting that the slow desorption stage was\nnot reached and the initial fast desorption stage alone could not provide sufficient\ninformation for determining the critical water volume. Nevertheless, comparison\nbetween the signal factor experiment and the orthogonal experiments showed that the\nresidual solvent in soil was 1.7 mg g-1 using 70 ml of water (Figure 4) whilst the\nlowest concentration was 1.1 mg g-1 when the water used was 100 ml (Table 2). It\nmay be concluded that enhancement of water volume above 100 ml will make no\nsignificant improvement of solvent removal rate and the critical water volume is\nestimated to be between 70 ml and 100 ml. Using unnecessarily excessive amounts of\nwater is unfavourable for economic reasons taking into account the cost of subsequent\n14\nwater recycling. Practically, it is a balance between the water wash efficiency and the\noperation cost.\n3.3. Effects of other factors\nIncreasing water temperature and prolonging washing time were both beneficial for\nrecycling the organic solvent as shown in Figure 5. This tendency agrees with those\nreported in previous works [12].\nThe adhesion between the solvent and the soil is weakened as the temperature\nincrease, resulting in the decrease of the solvent viscosity, increase of its mobility and\nincrease of its surface contact with water. Soil-compound interactions have been\nshown to be influenced by SOM, both in amount [26] and in nature [27]. According to\nthe polymer model [10], when the temperature is increased, the SOM in glass phase, a\nhighly condensed rigid structure, will be transited into rubber phase which is highly\nexpanded structure. This transition facilitates desorption of the sequestered organic\nsolvent because the SOM in rubber state has flexible chains owing to weak cohesive\nforces between chains. From this point of view, SOM will drastically influence the\nremoval rate of solvents although not being quantified in this study due to the fact that\nonly one kind of soil was studied. Further investigation needs to be performed to\nvalidate the mechanisms of the effects of SOM.\nA strong stir that is able to overcome the forces holding the molecules in their\nassociation will accelerate desorption of organic solvent. The forces that hold\nmolecules together include inter-particle forces, such as multi-pore interaction,\n15\ninduction forces, dipole-induced dipole interactions, Vander Waals forces, and\nhydrogen bonding interactions [28]. Dipole-dipole interactions are strongest when the\ndipoles are aligned head to tail, and the strongest hydrogen bonds are formed when\nthe two electronegative atoms and the hydrogen are collinear. Thus, the successive stir\nis an impediment to the formation of these interactions and the removal of organic\nsolvent can be enhanced by reinforcing the stirring strength [12, 29].\n3.4. Process treatment conceptualization\nBased on these overall findings, a conceptualized process for a soil contaminated with\na high concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons was developed (Figure 6). It was\nestimated that 6000 L solvent and 3500 L water will be required to treat one tonne of\nsoil with an initial TPH concentration of 140 mg g-1. Up to 99% of the solvent and\n94.3% of water can be recycled, resulting in 7 mg g-1 of TPH, 15 mg g-1 of solvent\nand 200 mg g-1 of water remaining in the soil (Figure 6). On this basis, the net volume\nof solvent and water retained in soil will be 23 L and 200 L, respectively. The volume\nof solvent lost by volatilization will be 30 L. Bioremediation strategy can be then\napplied for cleaning of the resulting contaminated soil.\n4. Conclusion\nThis research demonstrates that water washing is a promising technology for\nrecycling and reusing organic solvent used for petroleum hydrocarbon extraction in\ncontaminated soils. Water volume was the most influential parameter and the optimal\n16\nconditions for 20 g of soil were as follows: water volume of 100 ml, water\ntemperature of 40 \uf0b0C, washing time of 5 min and initial solvent concentration of 660\nmg g-1. These conditions are mild and easy to achieve, providing encouraging\ninformation for implementing solvent recycling with water at field scale. The\nproposed method is also more environmentally friendly, as water is an \u2018ultimate green\nsolvent\u2019, which will reduce significantly residual concentration of solvent in the\nenvironment. Considering the subsequent cost of water treatment, the volume of water\nused is suggested to be 3 ~ 4 times of that of organic solvent to be regenerated. The\nwater remaining in the washed soil should be recycled by filter pressing or\nsedimentation.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Hi-Technology Research & Development\nProgram of China (2007AA061202) and the Innovation Fund of Tianjin University.\nReference:\n[1] S.
