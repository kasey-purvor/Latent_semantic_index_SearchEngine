In the last 30 years we have moved \nfrom a situation where the gap between the capabilities of radiocarbon dating and \npotassium-argon dating could be described as \u201cthe muddle in the middle\u201d (Isaac \n1975), to having the ability to apply a range of techniques (OSL, TL, ESR, Uranium-\nseries, amino-acid racemisation, etc.).  Often multiple techniques are applied at one \nsite on samples with known stratigraphic relationships.  It is also frequently the case \nthat the object whose age is of interest (e.g. a hominid specimen) is not directly dated, \nbut dated by stratigraphic association or ordering.  In such cases we currently have no \nformal method to assess either the most likely age, or the uncertainty in that age, and \nas Ludwig (2003a) notes \u201cfor most studies the uncertainty of the date is no less \nsignificant than the date itself\u201d (emphasis in original).   \n \nIn contrast, in the Holocene radiocarbon is the dominant technique used (though far \nfrom the only one).  Over the last 15 years Bayesian chronological modelling has been \ndeveloped to the point of being a routine method for the analysis of stratigraphically \nrelated radiocarbon dates, allowing refinements in precision and the formal, numerical \nestimation of ages for objects related by stratigraphy to directly dated objects (Bayliss \n& Bronk Ramsey 2003, Buck 2003).  The analysis of the ages of Pleistocene deposits \nand their contents could be greatly enhanced if we had similar mathematical methods \nwhich could be applied to stratigraphic sequences dated with multiple techniques \n(Millard 2003).  This paper develops some of the necessary mathematical apparatus \nfor such analyses and demonstrates its application to stratigraphic sequences of dates \nby single methods; extension to sequences dated by multiple methods will be treated \nin a future paper.   \n \nEach technique requires separate consideration of the mathematical structure of the \ncalculations, and this paper tackles luminescence dating, uranium-series dating and \namino-acid racemisation dating.  ESR dating has been discussed elsewhere (Millard \nsubmitted). \n \nThe Structure of Bayesian Chronological Models \n \nThe basic idea of Bayesian chronological modelling is to combine dating information \nwith the known ordering of the dates from stratigraphy: \n 3 \nrefined dates  =  chronometry + stratigraphy, \nmore formally this is expressed as a form of Bayes' theorem:  \n p(dates | chronometry)  p(chronometry | dates)  p(dates), \nwhere p(dates) expresses our prior beliefs about the dates of events before obtaining \nchronometric measurements, p(chronometry | dates) is the likelihood which uses a \nmathematical model to express the probability of obtaining our observations if the \ndates were known and p(dates | chronometry) expresses our posterior beliefs \nincorporating our prior beliefs and the data. The prior beliefs can include statements \nabout relative ordering of events, and thus incorporate stratigraphic information. \n \nIn addition, the dates of objects or strata not dated directly can be incorporated in the \nprior beliefs in order to obtain an estimate of their age given all the chronometric and \nstratigraphic data.  Within the analysis of radiocarbon dates, the mathematical \nstatement of the model is usually as a stratigraphic ordering in time of dates within \nbroad limits, plus a mathematical statement of how a calendar date translates to a \nradiocarbon date via the calibration curve and laboratory measurement process (Buck \n2003).  A similar structure is adopted here for other dating techniques, using a prior \nordering statement combined with a likelihood describing the probability of observing \nthe measured values given the age, chronometer mechanism and the measurement \nprocess.  Thus the form of the likelihood needs to be derived separately for each \ndating technique, based on its chronometer mechanism and the required \nmeasurements.  As in all previous models of prior ordering, the stratigraphic order is \nassumed known with certainty; although in principle uncertainty in stratigraphic \nordering could be incorporated, the mathematical apparatus for doing this has not yet \nbeen developed. \n \nA broad structure for constructing a chronology using multiple chronometric \ntechniques applied to samples from a stratigraphic sequence may be developed as \nfollows (Lanos 2003).  The general equation governing the probability of a set of \nsamples having a set of dates is: \n p( | , ,S) p( | ,S, ) p(S| ) p( )\u03b8M g M g \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 , \nwhere  is the set of dates of interest, M are the chronometric measurements, g is any \nrequired set of calibration data or known parameters, and S is the stratigraphic \ninformation.  The likelihoods of observations in two chronometric techniques are \nindependent of one another if the techniques depend on different properties of the \nsamples and their environments.  In this case  \n \n1\np( | , , ) p( | , , ) p( | ) p( )\nJ\nM j j j\nj\nS S S\u03b8M g M g \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 , \nand we can use separate expressions for the likelihood, p(Mj | gj, S, ) of technique j.  \nFurther, some techniques date each sample separately and any parameters in common \nbetween samples (e.g. a half-life) are assumed to have negligible uncertainty.  This is \nthe usual assumption in the analysis of radiocarbon dates (Buck et al 1992) and is \noften applicable to closed-system uranium-series dates, but not to the other techniques \nconsidered here.  In this case the joint likelihood over all samples for the method can \nbe decomposed into the product of a series of likelihoods for the individual samples: \n \n1\np( | , , ) p( | , , )\nN\nj j j ji j ji\ni\nS SM g \u03b8 M g , \n 4 \nand need only be derived for an individual sample.   \n \nIn certain cases, the assumption of independence of techniques breaks down where \nthey utilise a parameter in common, e.g. TL and ESR dating of a site may depend on \none set of environmental -doserate measurements.  In these cases, a joint likelihood \nneeds to be derived.  This case is not tackled here.  Falsely assuming independence of \nthe techniques will lead to an underestimate of the uncertainty on dates compared to \nthe dependent calculation.  For sites where this occurs, the effort of deriving \nappropriate likelihoods should be weighed against the fact that commonality of one \namongst many parameters may only lead to a small underestimate of uncertainty. \n \nPRIOR PROBABILITIES FOR DATES \n \nEarly Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates assumed a uniform prior on all \nparameters, subject to the constraints of stratigraphic ordering and the limits of the \nradiocarbon calibration curve (e.g. Buck et al 1991, 1994a, 1994b, 1992).  This very \nsimple model attempted to allow the stratigraphy but no other aspects of the prior to \ninfluence the posterior probability distribution.  Further research has shown that when \nthere are large numbers of dates the choice of prior has little effect, but in cases with \nsmall numbers of dates (Nicholls & Jones 2001) or flat regions of the radiocarbon \ncalibration curve (Steier & Rom 2000) the results can be significantly altered by \nchoice of prior distribution.  Steier and Rom (2000) note that stratigraphic ordering \nsimply constrains the difference between dates to be positive and there is no obvious \nreason why the prior probability of difference should be uniform on the difference \nrather than on its logarithm, square root or some other transformation.  Thus a \nuniform prior is mathematically convenient but has no strong modelling basis.   \n \nBronk Ramsey (1998) observed that the usual method of conversion from \n14\nC\/\n12\nC \nratio to conventional radiocarbon age is equivalent to an exponential prior on the \nradiocarbon age, but if this is replaced with a uniform prior normalisation becomes \ndifficult for dates near the limit of the technique.  He proposed the use of a prior \nproportional to the inverse square of age, as this is the \u201cobvious choice \nmathematically\u201d, being the lowest negative power which is integrable and scale \ninvariant.   \n \nThe priors to be adopted before any stratigraphic constraints are imposed are thus not \nimmediately obvious and deserve some consideration.  In any dating technique based \non the decay of one isotope in comparison to a stable isotope, we have a likelihood of \nthe form \n ~ Norm(exp( ), )A s , \nwhere A is the observed ratio,  is the decay constant,  is the age and s is the \nobserved standard deviation, assumed to be known exactly.  Where one isotope \naccumulates in relation to another, as in K-Ar or U-Pa dating then it is 1-A that is \nobserved, but the principles remain the same.  Similar but more complex \nconsiderations apply in multiple isotope systems such as U-Th dating.  If a uniform, \nimproper prior on positive values is adopted for  then the posterior probability is \n \n2 2\np( | , , ) exp((exp( ) ) \/ 2 )A s A s . \n 5 \nThis has a finite value when  is infinite whatever the values of the other parameters, \nand is therefore always improper.  Bronk Ramsey (1998) investigated this prior \nnumerically and only found a problem for A\/s < 6.  This is probably due to numerical \nunderflow in computation of the probabilities for large  when A is far from zero.  \nHowever, it seems unsatisfactory to use a prior which in principle gives an improper \nposterior distribution but in practice is often computable due to underflow.  \nLikelihood based methods (e.g. Ludwig & Titterington 1994) do not have this \nproblem; for Bayesian methods to produce the same distributions and confidence \nintervals as likelihood methods requires the assumption of a prior which is the \ndifferential of the dating equation, \n p( ) exp( ) . \nThe posterior is then  \n \n2 2\np( | , , ) exp((exp(- ) - ) \/ 2 )A s A s , (1) \nand is proper.  This might be an \"obvious\" choice of prior, but it has the disadvantage \nthat the scale of the prior changes with the dating technique, so that when techniques \nare combined there is no \"obvious\" prior distribution.  Ludwig (2003a) has proposed a \nsystem for stratigraphically constrained Bayesian analysis of U-Th dates, with this \ntype of prior implied.  If more than one technique were used (or even U-Th and U-Pa) \nthere could be problems with the implied prior.  Ludwig\u2019s implementation of the \nmethod in IsoPlot (Ludwig 2003b) allows either Gaussian errors or U-Th asymmetric \nerrors, but not both in combination, and thus avoids the problem. \n \nInspection of equation (1) shows that the posterior will remain proper for any \nexponential prior, so the prior may have a different \u201cdecay constant\u201d 0 from the \nradioactive decay constant , and thus the posterior is: \n 2 2\n0\np( | , , ) exp((exp(- ) - ) \/ 2 )A s A s . \n can be interpreted as the rate of a Poisson process which destroys potentially \ndatable samples, and embodies an expectation that recent objects are more likely to be \nfound than ancient ones (compare Joyce 1999).  This is a usable prior but requires an \narbitrary choice of the value of .  However, from a Bayesian perspective,  is \nsimply another parameter and need not take a specific value, but can be uncertain with \na probability distribution as a hyper-prior, and under appropriate circumstances this \ncan be integrated out before calculating any dates.  With an improper uniform hyper-\nprior on , combined with the exponential prior proposed above, integrating  gives \na prior on  of \n2\np( ) , just as suggested by Bronk Ramsey (1998).  This is \ntantamount to saying that we have no knowledge of the rate of loss of datable objects, \nand assuming that any rate of loss is equally likely.  However the argument of Steier \nand Rom (2000) regarding choice of a vague prior on differences applies equally here.  \nAn alternative view might be that we are uncertain as to the mean lifetime of datable \nobjects, and a uniform prior on 1\/  should be taken.  Integrating out this hyperprior \ngives \n1\np( ) .  \n \nAlthough these hyperpriors have partial theoretical justification in terms of a loss \nprocess for datable samples, they both give a prior for  with the problem of an \ninfinite mass at =0  and thus an improper posterior for all values of A, s and 0.  \n 6 \nHowever the inverse square prior can be made proper with the small modification of \nsetting an arbitrary small limit to the age (Bronk Ramsey 1998).  This can be justified \non the grounds that when we date an object we don't believe it was formed the day \nbefore yesterday.  The inverse square prior is therefore a less arbitrary than might \nseem from Bronk Ramsey\u2019s (1998) paper, and requires fewer arbitrary choices than \nthe 1\/  prior, which can only be proper if both upper and lower limits to  are set.   \n \nA LIKELIHOOD FOR TL DATES \n \nLuminescence dating utilises a deceptively simple \u201cdating equation\u201d, which hides a \nseries of complexities in the method.  The account given here is abbreviated and \nbiased towards thermoluminescence dating but should be applicable to other forms of \nluminescence dating.  The dating principles of luminescence dating parallel those of \nthe other trapped charge technique, ESR dating, and thus the statistical model here \nparallels that for ESR (Millard 2003, Millard submitted).  Roberts (1997) gives a more \ndetailed treatment of the measurements and procedures required.  Rhodes et al. (2003) \nhave applied Bayesian statistical techniques to OSL dates at Old Scatness Broch using \nOxCal (Bronk Ramsey 1995), but note that their method has the disadvantage that \n\u201cthere is no easy way to treat systematic errors in a rigorously Bayesian way.\u201d  Here \nthe systematic and random uncertainties are examined to produce a more coherent \napproach. \n \nThe dating equation is simply: \n \ntotal exposure to radiation\nage    or   \nrate of exposure to radiation\nE\nD\nD\uf026\n \nWhen appropriately stimulated (by heat for thermoluminescence (TL) or light for \noptically stimulated luminescence (OSL)), the sample emits light in proportion to the \nradiation dose it has received since last being stimulated.  This palaeodose, DE, is \ndetermined by measurement of the luminescence of the sample and the changes in \nintensity of luminescence after application of additional artificial doses of radiation. \n \nThe dose rate, D\uf026 , is the sum of the rates from a series of sources of radiation, which \nare measured in a variety of ways: \n the dose from sample itself, intD\n\uf026 , determined by measuring the uranium, thorium \nand potassium content of the sample; \n the gamma radiation dose from the sediment, D\uf026 , determined either by in-situ \ngamma-spectrometry measurements or from chemical analysis of the U, Th and K \ncontent of the sediment and an assessment of the water content of the sediment; \n the beta radiation dose from the sediment, D\uf026 , estimated by the same means as \nthe gamma-dose, and adjusted for the geometry of the sample using an attenuation \nfactor.  In many cases using TL this dose is eliminated from consideration by \nremoving the outer 2mm of the sample. \nAll of these are measured with an associated error term. intD\n\uf026  is based on \nmeasurements with errors independent for each sample.  The same is assumed here \nfor DE although there will be some correlated components of uncertainty error in this \nterm, due to factors like calibration uncertainty of the artificial radiation sources; these \nconstitute only a minor part of the overall uncertainty, most of which is due to scatter \n 7 \nin the measurements. D\uf026  (and D\uf026 ) determinations usually apply to groups of dates, \nso their errors are not independent between samples in a group.  Such dependence \nneeds to be taken into account in analysis of the dates.   \n \nThe likelihood expresses the probability of the observed DE values if we knew the true \ndate and the true values of the components of the dose rate.  Consequently the dating \nequation is re-expressed as \nE\nD D\uf026 .  Consideration of the components of the dose \nrate shows that where there are multiple samples they fall into a hierarchy of groups \nfor these parameters (Figure 1), and therefore also for the associated uncertainties.  \nThe values for intD\n\uf026 , -efficiency (if measured), and the -attenuation factor are \nunique to a measured sample, whilst one true (but unknown) date, , is shared by sub-\nsamples (or aliquots) from the same object.  The other parameters derive from \nmeasurements on the environment in common to different sets of samples.  The \nsediment beta dose is common to a group of samples from the same sediment.  The \ngamma dose, D\uf026 , is homogenous on a larger spatial scale, often for all samples from \na stratum, and all samples with the same beta dose will have the same gamma dose.  \nFinally the cosmic rays dose, \ncosmicD\n\uf026  is the same across a whole site, but may be \nattenuated by varying overburdens of sediment for different samples; thus it usually \nparallels D\uf026  in grouping of samples, whilst the uncertainty is common to all samples. \n \nThese differing associations of parameter determinations with different subsets of the \ndated samples are expressed in a statistical model with a hierarchy of parameters.  \nThus the model may be expressed as: \n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nint DE cosmic\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\nint int int\n( )\ncosmic\n~ ,\n~ ,\n~ ,\n~ ,\nijkl ijkl ijkl\nE E E\nijkl l ijkl ijkl ijkl l jkl\nE\nl l l\nijkl ijkl kl\nkl kl kl\nijkl ijkl ijkl\nl\nD N s\nD D D D D\nD N m s\nD b\nN m s\nD N m s\nD\n\uf026 \uf026 \uf026 \uf026 \uf026\n\uf026\n\uf026\n\uf026\n\uf026 ( ) ( )\ncosmic cosmic\n~ ,\nl l\nN m s\n \nwhere i indexes over subsamples of sample j, from group k of samples with common \nsediment beta-doserate \n(kl)\n and from group l of samples with common gamma dose-\nrate and with beta attenuation factor, b\n(ijkl)\n, for each subsample.  Depending on the \nsite, the cosmic radiation dose may be common to all samples or particular samples.  \nThe equation as written assumes that it is common to the same groups as gamma dose.  \nFor any source of radiation, Z, Z is the true underlying value associated with the \nobserved rate \nZ\nD\uf026 , and sZ is its measured standard deviation.  Following the methods \nused for radiocarbon dating it is assumed that each sX is known, and the minor \nelement of uncertainty in these values is ignored.  The uncertainties are all assumed to \nbe normally distributed.   \n \n \n \n 8 \nThis set of assumptions and relationships follows a simplified form of those normally \nused for luminescence dating, with the addition of recognising the hierarchically \ncorrelated uncertainties.  As always, the results of the analysis cannot be better than \nits assumptions.  Using these methods it is possible to reanalyse published data only \nwhere sufficient detail of the dose-rate components is given.  For example, the \nsequences analysed by Rhodes et al (2003) would make a good test case for the new \nmethodology, but they did not publish the breakdown of the dose-rate components. \n \nCASE STUDY \u2013 TL DATING OF BURNT FLINTS AT ST C\u00c9SAIRE \n \nThe site of the collapsed rock-shelter at Saint-C\u00e9saire, in the valley of a tributary of \nthe Charente in western France, has yielded a stratigraphic sequence which covers the \nMiddle to Upper Palaeolithic transition including Mousterian, Ch\u00e2telperronian and \nAurignacian stone-tool industries.  Within one of the Ch\u00e2telperronian levels was a \nwell preserved Neanderthal skeleton (L\u00e9v\u00eaque et al 1993).  The site is thus important \nfor its lithic sequence and the fact that anatomically diagnostic human remains are \nassociated with the \u201ctransitional\u201d Ch\u00e2telperronian industry. \n \nThe Ch\u00e2telperronian is argued by some to represent acculturation of Neanderthals by \nincoming modern humans with Aurignacian technology (Mellars 2004), whilst others \nargue for its development by Neanderthals before contact with modern humans \n(d'Errico et al 2003).  A key point of contention is whether the Ch\u00e2telperronian clearly \noverlaps in time with the Aurignacian in the same region (Mellars 2004), or has \nclearly finished before the Aurignacian starts (d'Errico et al 2003).  Refining the \nchronology of sites like St Cesaire will help resolve these issues.  The placing of the \nNeanderthal remains at 36  3 ka (Mercier et al 1991) makes this one of the later \ndated specimens, and therefore important in understanding the wider picture of the \ntempo and mode of Neanderthal extinction. \n \nThe stratigraphic sequence at Saint-C\u00e9saire comprises a series of units which were \nclearly separated on the basis of colour and texture (Miskovsky & L\u00e9v\u00eaque 1993).  \nThere is an upper ensemble jaune (EJ) and a lower ensemble gris (EG) with layers \nlabelled on the basis of colour.  The primary dating of the site is by 20 TL dates on \nburnt flints (Mercier et al 1993, Mercier et al 1991).  Figure 2 shows schematically the \npart of the stratigraphy relating to those dates.  The luminescence measurements \nfollowed standard procedures.  The internal doserate was calculated using uranium, \nthorium and potassium contents measured by neutron activation analysis, after \nassessing the -efficiency using the method of Valladas and Valladas (1982).  The \nexternal -dose was measured by dosimeters placed in the site and a cosmic-ray dose \nwas calculated following Prescott and Stephan (1982).  Only the total environmental \ndoserate is reported by Mercier et al. (1993, 1991) \n \nThe stratigraphic information is transformed into prior information for a Bayesian \nanalysis following the method of Zeidler et al. (1998).  Within a layer no temporal \nordering of flints is known, so they are all assumed a priori to be equally likely to fall \nanywhere between a start date n and an end date n+1 for that stratum (n).  There is \nno evidence for hiatus in deposition, so it is assumed continuous; so that the end date \nfor one stratum is the start date for the next.  Transition dates between strata are \nassumed to be equally likely to take any dates between 0 and 1000ka, as long as they \nhave the correct ordering.  Comparative calculations were also made using a prior \n 9 \nprobability for dates proportional to the inverse square of age, subject to the ordering \nspecified above. \n \nThe mathematical model above is modified in the following ways, and additional \nassumptions made, to compute the required values from the published data: \n uncertainty in the cosmic ray dose is ignored, as it is not given and Aitken \n(1985, Appendix B) argues that this uncertainty is negligible compared to the \nother uncertainties \n the external doses are assumed independently measured (there were 40 \ndosimeters for 20 flints), except where flints from the same layer are report to \nhave exactly the same external dose, where the external doses are assumed the \nsame. \n the internal gamma dose is a fraction of the infinite matrix dose for the \ncomposition of the flint, depending on the geometry of the flint.  These \ngeometric factors were reconstructed from the difference between internal \ndose and the sum of internal alpha and beta doses reported in Mercier et al. \n(1991), scaled by the infinite matrix dose calculated from the composition \nusing the tables of Bell (1979) \n uncertainty in the external dose is calculated by subtracting in quadrature the \nuncertainty in internal dose from the uncertainty in the total annual dose, and \nthe 7% systematic uncertainty in the external dose. \n All dose-rates were then re-calculated using the dose-rate conversion factors \nof Adamiec & Aitken (1998) and the -track lengths of Brennan and Lyons \n(1989).  Revised figures are included in Table 1. \n \nThe model described above was implemented in WinBUGS 1.4 (Lunn et al 2000, \nSpiegelhalter et al 2004), after manipulation of the published data to the required form \nin a spreadsheet.  For comparison, dates were calculated following the same methods \nas Mercier et al. (1993, 1991), using the original dose-rate factors and revised ones.  \nUsing the original factors and methods, no differences were observed in comparisons \nwith the original calculations. Revised dose-rates and dates are shown in Table 1.  The \nrevised dose-rates increase the ages by 1-3% (0.4-1.3ka).  The Bayesian stratigraphic \nanalysis reflects this increase in age but also reduces the uncertainty for most of the \ndates, leading to higher chronological resolution. \n \nThe Neanderthal skeleton, placed at 36.3 2.7ka (95% CI 30.9-41.7ka) by Mercier et \nal. (1993, 1991), would be placed at 37.2 2.6ka (95% CI 32.0-42.4ka) using the \nrevised dose-conversion factors now available and the same approach of considering \nonly the mean of dates from stratum EJop sup (calculated using the methodology of \nAitken (1985, Appendix B)).  The stratigraphic model used here considers not only \nthe uncertainties in the individual dates, but also the additional uncertainty that the \nskeleton could come from anywhere in the time period of the stratum, and the \nadditional data of the stratigraphic relationships between dates.  This now gives a \nmean for the dates of the stratum of 33.9-41.9 ka, and a date for the Neanderthal \nremains of 32.8-42.5 ka, at 95% credibility.   \n \nA LIKELIHOOD FOR URANIUM-SERIES DATES \n \nUranium-series dating is based upon the geochemical separation of uranium (U) and \nits decay products (progeny), deposition of that U in a new mineral and subsequent \n 10 \nbuild up of the progeny isotopes. An overview and summary is given by Latham \n(2001).  Thorium (Th) is insoluble in water under most natural circumstances, whilst \nU is soluble in oxidizing conditions, so the separation is often and easily obtained. \nThe essential assumptions of the method are  \n no Th present at the time of formation of the mineral,  \n no gain or loss of U or Th after formation, except by radioactive decay.  \nA system satisfying these conditions is called a closed system.  Equations for the \nactivity ratios of various isotopes at time t from formation are readily derived \n(Ivanovich & Harmon 1992 Appendix A): \n \n230 238 238\n0\n0 0 4238 234 234\n0 4\nTh U U\n1 exp 1 1 exp\nU U U\n \nwhere each isotope symbol represents the activity of that isotope (i.e. the rate of \nradioactive disintegration per unit mass of sample) and n is the decay constant for the \nisotope of mass 230+n. Typically, corals and detritus-free speleothems can be dated \nusing this equation. The isotope ratios are determined with uncertainties. Here I \nfollow the common implicit assumption in the literature that they can be \napproximated as normally distributed errors (Ludwig (2003b, p. 25) gives a rare \nexplicit statement of this approximation). Hence likelihoods suitable for incorporation \nin chronological models for U-Th dating are  \n \n04 04 04\n48 48 48\n0\n04 0 48 48 0 4\n0 4\n| Norm ,\n| Norm ,\n1 exp \/ 1 1 exp\nr s\nr s\n\uf03a\n\uf03a  \nwhere rnm is the observed ratio of isotope 230+n to 230+m, nm is the true underlying \nvalue and snm is the observed standard deviation of the ratio. A prior on  is specified \nfrom stratigraphic considerations, and a suitable prior is placed on 48, e.g. \n48 ~ Unif(0,20), would be a vague prior encompassing the entire range of values \nobserved in natural systems.  \n \nModern, precise, TIMS (thermal ionization mass spectrometry) measurements lead to \na further complication, in that the uncertainty in the decay constants is no longer \nnegligible and must be accounted for. Such uncertainties are, of course, common to all \nU-series dates in a chronological model, and the independence assumption, which \nsimplifies the calculations in radiocarbon chronological models, cannot be \nmaintained.  \n \nThere are many attractive sample materials with high uranium contents and clear \narchaeological relevance that do not conform to the assumption of negligible initial \nTh.  Detrital contamination in calcites is usually tackled using an isochron approach. \nSeveral sub-samples are taken, either mechanically or by sequential leaching with \nacid, and measurements made on them. Given that they are of the same age, but \nusually contain varying amounts of detritus, they yield differing isotope ratios which \ncan then be used in an appropriate regression to determine the composition when there \nis zero detritus. Ludwig and Titterington (1994) discuss the various ways in which \nthis can be approached, and maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters of \ninterest, together with error estimates.  These methods can be adapted for Bayeisan \n 11 \nstratigraphic analyses (Millard 2003).  Alternatively, an initial \n230\nTh\/\n232\nTh ratio can be \nassumed, or measured on a suitable sample. \n \nCASE STUDY \u2013U-SERIES DATING OF SPELEOTHEMS AT LA CHAISE DE \nVOUTHON \n \nLa Chaise-de-Vouthon is a multi-chambered cave in the valley of the River Tardoir, \nin the Charente region of France.  It has yielded a long sequence of stone tools (from \nthe Acheulean to the Aurignacian) and numerous hominid  remains, both Neanderthal \nand pre-Neanderthal.  Samples from two of the chambers have been analysed in \nseveral chronometric studies.  Blackwell et al. (1983) conducted the first full-scale \nstudy, dating various speleothems using uranium-series dating, and following up the \ninitial study of Schwarcz and Deb\u00e9nath (1979).  The relatively well defined dates \nfrom Blackwell et al (1983) for the site have subsequently been used to test ESR \ndating of tooth enamel (Blackwell et al 1992) and uranium-series dating of bone (Rae \net al 1987).  Both these later studies show underestimates of the age, which may be \nattributable to mobilisation of uranium in the deposits upsetting these techniques\u2019 \nassumptions about uranium uptake processes. \n \nAs an example of the application of the methods described above I present a re-\nanalysis of uranium-series results for the Borgeois-Delauney chamber of the cave.  \nUranium-series measurements were obtained on two flowstones, forming Beds 7 and \n11 of the stratigraphic sequence, plus stalagmites formed on top of Bed 7 before the \ndeposition of Bed 6.  Intercalated between Beds 7 and 11 are Beds 8, 9 and 10.  Bed 8 \nwas \u201cvery poor\u201d, and yielded little in the way of remains.  Beds 9 and 10 yielded \npollen indicating a cool wet climate, in contrast to the pollen from the flowstones \nwhich indicated  a warm wet climate.  Tools described as transitional Acheulean to \nMousterian were found in Beds 9 and 10.  Hominid remains were found at the very \ntop of Bed 12, partly encrusted with the calcite of the Bed 11 flowstone. \n \nBlackwell et al (1983) obtained uranium-series dates from multiple, stratigraphically \nrelated samples within individual speleothem deposits.  The Bayesian analysis needs \nto respect these orderings and the ordering of the layers.  Figure 3 shows the \nchronological model adopted.  Stalagmite subsample LC11-2 of the original dataset \nhas been omitted as it showed signs of recent recrystallisation, and flowstone sample \nLC13 has been omitted as there are some doubts about its stratigraphic integrity. \n \nBlackwell et al (1983) made a correction for detritial contamination using the \nmeasured \n230\nTh\/\n232\nTh ratio and assuming that the detritus did not contribute to the \nextracted uranium, and had an initial \n230\nTh\/\n232\nTh ratio of 1.25.  The same assumptions \nare followed here.  In Blackwell et al.\u2019s (1983) table of dates, there is one significant \nanomaly in the that the date of sample LC47C-1 is reported as 112 5 ka, but the \nreported isotope ratios correspond to an age of 143 11 ka, and this date is mentioned \nin the text.  For the purposes of calculations reported here, I have assumed the isotope \nratios to be correct and the reported age to be a typographical error, as it duplicates the \nage of LC47C-3. \n \nOf particular interest are the date of the hominid remains at the top of Bed 12, and the \ntiming and duration of Beds 8-10, as well as the overall chronology.  The analysis was \nconducted using Markov-chain Monte Carlo in WinBUGS (Lunn et al 2000, \n 12 \nSpiegelhalter et al 2004).  Comparison was made of uniform priors and inverse-square \npriors with an upper bound on the layer boundaries of 1Ma.  Use of a uniform rather \nthan an inverse square prior made little difference to the results, so only results \nobtained using inverse-square priors are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2.  Bed 10 is \nfound to start at 92-116 ka and Bed 8 to end at 87-110 ka (both at 95% credibility).  \nThe overall duration of Beds 8-10 is 0.2-20 ka, implying a deposition rate of \napproximately 0.07 to 7 mm per year.  The date of the hominid remains of Bed 12 is \nharder to evaluate, as there is no real constraint on their maximum age.  A \nconservatively young estimate is that they are similar in age to the oldest dated sample \nfrom Bed 11.  On this basis they are older than 151-188 ka. \n \nThese results place the hominid remains somewhat earlier than Blackwell et al.\u2019s \n(1983) estimate of 151 15 ka.  They also demonstrate that although the accumulation \nof layers 8 to 10 must have been rapid, considerable uncertainty remains about their \nduration.  The cool, wet climate found in layers 8-10 must correspond with some or \nall of oxygen isotope substages 5b-d. \n \nAMINO-ACID RACEMIZATION \n \nAmino-acid racemization (AAR) is a chemical dating technique reliant on the \ntransformation of the L-amino-acids found in all living organisms to their mirror \nimage molecules, D-amino-acids. After death the biochemical maintenance systems \nare no longer in place and L-amino-acids are gradually transformed to D-amino-acids \nuntil an equilibrium level is reached. AAR dating has been beset by problems caused \nby various processes which alter the D\/L ratio, for example by leaching of amino-\nacids, and these have led to its general abandonment, unless a closed system can be \ndemonstrated. Of the materials which maintain a closed system, ostrich egg-shell is \nthe most commonly dated.  For more details of the method see Aitken (1990) or  \nJohnson & Miller (1997). \n \nAmino-acid racemisation in ostrich eggshell has been used in the dating of a number \nof important archaeological and palaeoanthropological sites, e.g., Border Cave, \nApollo 11 Cave (Miller et al 1999), Equus Cave (Johnson et al 1997), Bir Tarfawi \n(Miller 1993, Miller et al 1991), and Semliki (Brooks et al 1995). \n \nOn the basis of the published descriptions of the techniques it is in principle possible \nto develop a statistical model of the likelihood for AAR dating suitable for \nchronometric analyses similar to those described above for TL and uranium-series \ndating (Millard 2003).  This would be useful in improving chronologies at the sites \nmentioned and in integrating AAR dates with other chronometric methods. Such an \nanalysis would rely on having the basic chronometric data, in the form of D\/L ratios \nand other measurements for stratigraphically related individual samples.  However, \nthis is where a major obstacle is encountered, as AAR data are rarely published for \nindividual samples, but as averaged D\/L ratios for layers.  Moreover, as variation \nwithin a layer is often greater than the analytical uncertainties, the latter are not \nreported.  I have found only two published AAR chronologies with individual sample \nmeasurements reported.  At Equus Cave (Johnson et al 1997) the deposits appear to be \nmixed, and a stratigraphic analysis is pointless.  At Bir Tarfawi, there are significant \nperiods between most of the dated layers, (Miller 1993, Miller et al 1991) so that an \nanalysis incorporating stratigraphy will produce little improvement in chronological \n 13 \nresolution.  If full data on AAR dates were published, as is routine for luminescence, \nESR and uranium-series dating, then the data would be amenable to analysis, and \nincorporation in more comprehensive attempts at chronology building. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThis paper has shown that it is possible to develop a mathematical apparatus suitable \nfor the incorporation of luminescence, uranium-series and other dating techniques into \nthe Bayesian statistical framework which is currently available primarily for \nradiocarbon dates.  This allows coherent analysis of stratigraphic and chronometric \nevidence, but reanalysis of published data relies on full publication of the parameters \nwhich go into calculation of a date.  As expected, the incorporation of the additional \ndata about stratigraphic relationships allows us to arrive at more precise estimates of \nthe dates of events, at times even though additional stratigraphic uncertainty is \nallowed for as well.  Although bespoke computer code is currently needed for each \nsite, it should now be possible to start to integrate multiple techniques applied to a \nsingle site to obtain more coherent chronologies from Pleistocene archaeological and \npalaeoanthropological sites. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThis paper was written as part of research leave funded jointly by Durham University \nand the Arts and Humanities Research Board (award number \nRLS:APN15253\/AN9564). \n \nNOTE: \nThe WinBUGS code use for the examples and instructions for using it are available \nfrom the author\u2019s website http:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/a.r.millard\/ \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAdamiec G, Aitken M. 1998.
