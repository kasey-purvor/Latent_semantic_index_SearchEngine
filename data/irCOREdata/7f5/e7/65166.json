INTRODUCTION\nTHE objective of this paper is to compare five differentgenerator systems for wind turbines, namely the doubly-\nfed induction generator with three-stage gearbox (DFIG3G),\nthe direct-drive synchronous generator with electrical exci-\ntation (DDSG), the direct-drive permanent-magnet generator\n(DDPMG), the permanet-magnet generator with single stage\ngearbox (PMG1G) and the doubly-fed induction generator with\nsingle-stage gearbox (DFIG1G).\nThe three most commonly used generator systems for wind\nturbines are as follows [1], [2].\n1) Until the late 1990s, most wind turbine manufacturers\nbuilt constant-speed wind turbines with power levels be-\nlow 1.5 MW using a multistage gearbox and a standard\nsquirrel-cage induction generator, directly connected to\nthe grid.\n2) Since the late 1990s, most wind turbine manufacturers\nhave changed to variable speed wind turbines for power\nlevels from roughly 1.5 MW, mainly to enable a more flex-\nible match with requirements considering audible noise,\npower quality, and energy yield. They have used a multi-\nstage gearbox, a relatively low-cost standard DFIG and a\nManuscript received May 25, 2005; revised January 30, 2006.

A power\nelectronic converter for the full-rated power is then neces-\nsary for the grid connection. The low-speed high-torque\ngenerators and the fully rated converters for these wind\nturbines are rather expensive.\nMost direct-drive turbines being sold at the moment have syn-\nchronous generators with electrical excitation. However, [3]\u2013[7]\nclaim benefits for permanent magnet excitation, which elim-\ninates the excitation losses. In this paper, this difference is\nquantified. Fig. 1 depicts an example of a wind turbine with\na permanent-magnet direct-drive generator [8].\nFor the increasing power levels and decreasing speeds, these\ndirect-drive generators are becoming larger and even more ex-\npensive. Therefore, it has been proposed to use a single-stage\ngearbox (with a gear ratio in the order of 6 or higher) and a\npermanent-magnet generator [7]. This system, called the multi-\nbrid system, is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nOn the one hand, the resulting system combines some of\nthe disadvantages of both the geared and direct-drive systems:\nthe system has a gearbox and it has a special and therefore\nexpensive generator and a fully rated converter. On the other\nhand, compared to direct-drive systems, a significant decrease\n0885-8969\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Sketch of the system with a single-stage gearbox. Source: WinWinD.\nin the generator cost and an increase in the generator efficiency\ncan be obtained.\nFurther, the question arises whether this system with a single-\nstage gearbox could be used in combination with a DFIG. Be-\ncause the generator torque is still rather high and the speed rather\nlow, the generator can be expected to have a large diameter\nand air gap, and therefore a high magnetizing current and high\nlosses. However, the rating of the converter could be reduced to\nroughly 30%, giving an important benefit in cost and efficiency.\nThis new system is introduced and further investigated in this\npaper.\nFor both systems with a single-stage gearbox, the use of a\ngearbox leads to a significant reduction of the external dimen-\nsions, enabling the installation of such a 3-MW wind turbine on\nlocations that are currently limited from a logistic point of view\nto 1.5-MW turbines.\nThe objective of this paper, therefore, is to compare five wind\nturbine generator systems, namely:\n1) the DFIG3G as currently used;\n2) the DDSG as currently used;\n3) the DDPMG;\n4) the PMG1G;\n5) the DFIG1G.\nTo compare the five generator systems, a 3-MW, 15-r\/min\nwind turbine is used. For this turbine, an approximate design\nof the generators is made to get indications of weight and cost.\nThe differences in annual energy yield are calculated for a given\nwind climate. This comparison and the proposal to use a DFIG\nin combination with a single-stage gearbox are the original con-\ntributions of this paper.\nAn early comparison of the efficiency of three wind turbine\ngenerator systems is given in [9]. In [6] and [7], more genera-\ntor systems were compared and more criteria were taken into\naccount. The contribution of this paper is that it introduces the\nTABLE I\nMODELING CHARACTERISTICS\nDFIG1G, and compares it with four other generator systems.\nIt also quantifies the difference between the electrical-excited\ndirect-drive generator and the PM direct-drive generator.\nThe paper starts with a section about modeling of the wind\nturbine, the gearbox, the converter, and the generator. Next the\nfive generator designs are briefly described and the resulting\nperformance is given. The paper concludes with a comparison\nof the five generator concepts.\nII. MODELING THE GENERATOR CONCEPTS\nA. Wind Turbine Modeling\nTable I gives the characteristics of the wind turbine that was\nused to compare the different generator systems. Using these\ncharacteristics, the available shaft power P can be calculated as\na function of the wind speed as [2], [10]\nP =\n1\n2\n\u03c1airCp(\u03bb, \u03b8)\u03c0r2v3w (1)\nwhere \u03c1air is the mass density of air, r is the wind turbine\nrotor radius, vw is the wind speed, and Cp(\u03bb, \u03b8) is the power\ncoefficient or the aerodynamic efficiency, which is a function of\nthe tip speed ratio \u03bb (tip speed divided by wind speed) and the\npitch angle \u03b8.\nFig. 3 illustrates the rotor speed, which is assumed to be pro-\nportional to the wind speed at maximum aerodynamic efficiency\nat low wind speeds and equal to the rated rotor speed at higher\nwind speeds (above 9 m\/s). At wind speeds above the rated\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham. Downloaded on April 13,2010 at 15:30:09 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Rotor speed and Weibull distribution of the wind as a function of wind\nspeed.\nwind speed, the blades are pitched to reduce the aerodynamic\nefficiency and so the power.\nFor energy yield calculations, an average wind speed of 7 m\/s\nwith a Weibull distribution [10] is used as illustrated in Fig. 3.\nIntegrating the area below the curve gives a value of 1.\nTable I also gives some approximate numbers for the cost of\nthe rest of the wind turbine. Because the paper concentrates on\nthe generator system, these numbers are not extensively vali-\ndated and must be seen only as indicators.\nB. Gearbox Modeling\nThe gear ratio of the single-stage gearbox is chosen as 6.\nSome references suggest higher gear ratios [7]. However, at the\nmoment, this is not seen as proven technology with a guaranteed\nlifetime. From the commercially available gearboxes, it appears\nto be cheaper to use gearboxes with more stages for higher gear\nratios. A cost estimate of the gearbox is given in Table I.\nAccording to [11], a viscous loss of 1% of the rated power\nper gearbox stage is a reasonable model. This means that the\nlosses are proportional to the speed\nPgear = Pgearm\nn\nnrated\n(2)\nwhere Pgearm is the loss in the gearbox at rated speed (3%\nof rated power for a three-stage gearbox [11] and 1.5% for a\nsingle-stage gearbox, see Table I), n is the rotor speed (r\/min),\nand nrated is the rated rotor speed (r\/min).\nC. Converter Modeling\nA back-to-back voltage source inverter is used to ensure that\nthe generator currents and the grid currents are sinusoidal. A\ncost estimate is given in Table I.\nThere are various ways of modeling converter losses [12].\nThe model used here divides them into three parts [13]:\n1) a small part that is constant and consists of power dis-\nsipated in power supplies, gate drivers, control, cooling\nsystems and so on [9];\n2) a large part that is proportional to the current and consists\nof switching losses and conduction losses;\n3) a part that is proportional to the current squared and con-\nsists of conduction losses because the on-state voltage of\na semiconductor increases with the current.\nTherefore, the losses in the converter Pconv are modeled as\nPconv =\nPconvm\n31\n(\n1 + 10\nIs\nIsm\n+ 5\nI2s\nI2sm\n+ 10\nIg\nIgm\n+ 5\nI2g\nI2gm\n)\n(3)\nwhere Pconvm is the dissipation in the converter at rated power\n(3% of the rated power of the converter, see Table I), Is is the\ngenerator side converter current , Ism is the maximum generator\nside converter current, Ig is the grid side converter current, and\nIgm is the maximum grid side converter current.\nD. Generator Modeling\nThe different generators are modeled using equivalent circuit\nmodels. This section describes the equations used to determine\nthe parameters of the equivalent circuit. The machine parameters\nare calculated in conventional ways [9].\nThe following assumptions are used in the calculations.\n1) Space harmonics of the magnetic flux density distribu-\ntion in the air gap are negligible; only the fundamental is\nconsidered.\n2) The magnetic flux density crosses the air-gap perpendic-\nularly.\nSlot, air-gap, and end-winding leakage inductances are cal-\nculated as given in [14]. The magnetizing inductance of an AC\nmachine is given by [14], [15]\nLsm =\n6\u00b50lsrs(kwNs)2\np2geff\u03c0\n(4)\nwhere ls is the stack length in axial direction, rs is the stator\nradius, Ns is the number of turns of the phase winding, kw is\nthe winding factor [14], [15], p is the number of pole pairs, and\ngeff is the effective air gap.\nThe effective air gap of the machine depends on the type of\nmachine. For all machine types, it can be written as\ngeff = ksatkCskCr\n(\ng +\nlm\n\u00b5rm\n)\n(5)\nwhere ksat is a factor representing the reluctance of the iron in\nthe magnetic circuit, kCs is the Carter factor for the stator slots\n[14], kCr is the Carter factor for the rotor slots (if present) [14], g\nis the mechanical air gap, \u00b5rm is the relative recoil permeability\nof the magnets, and lm is the magnet length in the direction of the\nmagnetization (which is zero in a machine without permanent\nmagnets).\nThe Carter factor is given by [14], [16]\nkC =\n\u03c4s\n\u03c4s \u2212 g1\u03b3\ng1 = g +\nlm\n\u00b5rm\n\u03b3 =\n4\n\u03c0\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed bso\n2g1\narctan\n(\nbso\n2g1\n)\n\u2212 log\n\u221a\n1 +\n(\nbso\n2g1\n)2\uf8f6\uf8f8 (6)\nwhere \u03c4s is the slot pitch and bso is the slot opening width.\nThe factor representing the reluctance of the iron of the mag-\nnetic circuit is calculated as [17]\nksat = 1 +\n1\nHggeff\n\u222b lFe\n0\nHFedlFe (7)\nwhere HFe is the magnetic field intensity in the iron, estimated\nfrom the BH curve.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Sketch of a cross section of four poles of a permanent magnet syn-\nchronous machine with full pitch winding.\nIn permanent-magnet machines, this factor representing sat-\nuration is much smaller than in the other machines because the\neffective air gap is much larger due to the low permeability of\nthe magnets.\nUsing Ampere\u2019s circuital law, the BH characteristic of a rare-\nearth permanent magnet and the magnetic flux continuity, the\nflux density above a magnet in the air gap of a permanent-magnet\nmachine (Fig. 4) can be calculated as [15]\nB\u02c6g =\nlm\n\u00b5rmgeff\nBrm (8)\nwhere Brm is the remanent flux density of the magnets (1.2 T).\nUsing Fourier analysis, the fundamental space harmonic of\nthis flux density can be calculated as [15], [16]\nB\u02c6g =\nlm\n\u00b5rmgeff\nBrm\n4\n\u03c0\nsin\n(\n\u03c0bp\n2\u03c4p\n)\n(9)\nwhere \u03c4p is the pole pitch and bp is the width of the magnet.\nThe no-load (motional) voltage induced by this flux density\nin a stator winding can be calculated as [15], [16]\nEp =\n\u221a\n2kwNs\u03c9mrslsB\u02c6g (10)\nwhere \u03c9m is the mechanical angular speed of the rotor.\nThe copper losses are calculated from the currents and the\nresistances. The phase resistance is calculated as\nRs =\n\u03c1CulCus\nACus\n(11)\nwhere \u03c1Cu is the resistivity of copper, ACus is the cross-sectional\narea of the conductor, and lCus is the length of the conductor of\nthe phase winding.\nThe length of the conductor is calculated as the number of\nturns multiplied by the length of a turn, where the length of a\nturn is estimated as twice stack length (in the slots) plus four\ntimes the pole pitch (for the end windings)\nlCus = Ns(2ls + 4\u03c4p). (12)\nThe cross-section area of the conductor is the available slot\narea multiplied by the fill factor divided by the number of turns\nper slot:\nACus =\npqksfilbsavhs\nNs\n(13)\nwhere q is the number of slots per pole per phase, ksfil is the slot\nfill factor (60%), bsav is the average slot width, and hs is the slot\nheight.\nThe specific iron losses (the iron losses per unit mass) are\ncalculated using [14], [15]\nPFe = 2PFe0h\n(\nfe\nf0\n)(\nB\u02c6Fe\nB\u02c60\n)2\n+ 2PFe0e\n(\nfe\nf0\n)2(\nB\u02c6Fe\nB\u02c60\n)2\n(14)\nwhere fe is the frequency of the field in the iron, PFe0h is the\nhysteresis loss per unit mass at the given angular frequency f0\nand flux density B0 (Table I), and PFe0e is the eddy current loss\nper unit mass at the given angular frequency f0 and flux density\nB0 (Table I).\nThe factor 2 is included in this equation because the flux den-\nsities do not change sinusoidally and they are not sinusoidally\ndistributed, which increases the iron losses. High quality lami-\nnations are used to limit the iron losses in the generators with\nhigher frequencies.\nTo calculate the total iron losses, the specific iron losses in\nthe different parts (teeth and yokes) are evaluated, multiplied by\nthe weight of these parts, and added.\nTo find out the cost of a generator, the masses of iron, copper,\nand magnets are calculated and multiplied by the assumed cost\nper kilogram of the material (see Table I).\nIII. GENERATOR DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE\nA. DFIG3G\nThe number of pole pairs of the DFIG3G is chosen as 3.\nBecause the stator is directly connected to the 50-Hz grid, the\nsynchronous speed is 1000 r\/min. With a gear ratio of 80, the\nrated speed of the generator is 1200 r\/min, so that at rated speed,\nthere is still some margin for control purposes.\nThe DFIG3G has an air-gap radius of 0.42 m and a stack\nlength of 0.75 m. Other important dimensions are given in\nTable II.\nFig. 5 depicts two induction-machine equivalent circuits. The\nrotor side parameters are all referred parameters. The parame-\nters of the second equivalent circuit can be calculated from the\nparameters of the first in the following way [15]:\nLs = Ls\u03c3 + Lsm;\nRR =\nRrL\n2\ns\nL2sm\nLL =\nLs\u03c3Ls\nLsm\n+\nLr\u03c3L\n2\ns\nL2sm\n. (15)\nTo simplify the calculations, the second equivalent circuit\nhas been used. It is further assumed that the converter controls\nthe rotor current in such a way that the magnetizing current is\nconfined to the stator and that the transformed rotor current IR\nis in phase with the voltage applied to the inductance Ls.\nFig. 6 depicts some results from the model as a function of\nthe wind speed.

Table II gives\nthe annual energy yield and the annual dissipation. It also gives\ncost estimates.\nThe losses in the gearbox dominate the losses in this generator\nsystem: Roughly 70% of the annual energy dissipation in the\ngenerator system is in the gearbox.\nB. DDSG\nThe air-gap diameter of the DDSG is chosen to be 5 m. From\nthe electromagnetic point of view, larger air-gap diameters are\nbetter, but mechanical design, construction and transportation\nFig. 5.

This 5-m air-gap diameter is a compro-\nmise between these criteria.\nFig. 7 depicts a cross section of two poles of the machine. The\nnumber of slots per pole per phase is two. Increasing this number\nmakes the machine heavier and more expensive because of the\nincreasing dimensions of end-windings and yokes. Decreasing\nthis number results in a significant increase in the excitation\nlosses, mainly in part load. Table II gives some other important\ndimensions.\nFig. 8 depicts the equivalent circuit of the DDSG and the ap-\nplied phasor diagram. The phase current leads the phase voltage\na little in order to reduce saturation and excitation losses while a\nlarger rating of the converter is not necessary.

Characteristics of the DDSG.\nFig. 9 depicts some results from the model as a function of\nthe wind speed: voltage, current, power, generator efficiency,\ngenerator system efficiency (including losses in the converter),\nand losses. The annual energy dissipation, determined from a\ncombination of the losses with the Weibull distribution is also\ndepicted in Fig. 9. Table II gives the resulting annual energy\nyield and the annual dissipation. It also gives estimated costs.\nThe generator construction is assumed to cost C=160 000.\nThe main sources of losses in this system are the copper losses\nin the stator and the rotor. They could be reduced by using more\nmaterial, but that makes the generator more expensive. Iron\nlosses are small; less than 5% of the annual dissipation in the\nsystem is in the iron. Using cheaper laminations with more\nlosses will hardly influence the performance.\nC. DDPMG\nThe air-gap diameter of the DDPMG is chosen as 5 m for the\nsame reasons as for the DDSG.\nA cross section of four pole pitches is depicted in Fig. 4. Com-\npared to the DDSG the number of poles is doubled to reduce\nthe risk of demagnetizing the magnets and to reduce the dimen-\nsions of yokes and end-windings. Doubling the number of poles\ndoes not increase the excitation losses as in the DDSG because\npermanent magnets are used. Other important dimensions are\ngiven in Table II.\nThe equivalent circuit of the permanent-magnet generator and\nthe applied phasor diagram are depicted in Fig. 10. The phase\nFig. 10. Equivalent circuit of the permanent-magnet synchronous machine\nand the applied phasor diagram.\nFig. 11. Characteristics of the DDPMG.\ncurrent is in the middle between the terminal voltage and the\nvoltage induced by the magnets in order to reduce the saturation\nand to get a compromise between the converter rating and the\ngenerator rating.\nFig. 11 depicts some results from the model as a function of\nthe wind speed: voltage, current, power, generator efficiency,\ngenerator system efficiency (including losses in the converter),\nand losses. The annual energy dissipation, determined from a\ncombination of the losses with the Weibull distribution, is also\ndepicted in Fig. 11. Table II gives the annual energy yield,\nthe annual dissipation, and the estimated costs. The generator\nconstruction is assumed to cost C=150 000, which is a little\nless than the construction of the electrically excited generator\nbecause the generator is lighter.\nThe largest part of the losses is losses in the converter. Iron\nlosses are not negligible; at wind speeds up to 8 m\/s, they are\nlarger than the copper losses and over 15% of the annual dissi-\npation in the generator system is in the iron.\nD. PMG1G\nAlthough the speed of the PMG1G generator is considerably\nhigher than that of a direct-drive generator, the rated speed of 90\nr\/min is still low. Therefore, this generator is also built as a ring\nmachine with a large radius. The air-gap diameter is chosen as\n3.6 m to eliminate the most important transportation problems.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Characteristics of the PMG1G.\nThe pole-pitch layout of this machine is kept the same as\nthe pole-pitch layout of the DDPMG generator of Fig. 9. Other\nimportant dimensions are given in Table II. The control is kept\nthe same as in Fig. 10.\nFig. 12 depicts some results from the model as a function of\nthe wind speed: voltage, current, power, generator efficiency,\ngenerator system efficiency (including losses in the converter\nand the gearbox), and losses. The annual energy dissipation,\ndetermined from a combination of the losses with the Weibull\ndistribution, is also depicted in Fig. 12. Table II gives the annual\nenergy yield and the annual dissipation. It also gives cost esti-\nmates. The generator construction is assumed to cost C=50 000.\nIn this system, the losses in the converter and the gearbox\nare important. The iron losses in the generator at rated speed\nare in the same order of magnitude as copper losses due to the\nrelatively high frequency of 84 Hz.\nE. DFIG1G\nFor the same reasons as for the PMG1G, the air-gap diameter\nof the DFIG1G is 3.6 m. The rated speed of the DFIG1G is\n90 rpm.\nThe rated speed of the induction machine with single-stage\ngearbox is 90 r\/min. The synchronous speed of the induction\ngenerator is chosen at 75 r\/min, so that at the rated speed, there is\nstill some margin both in speed and power for control purposes.\nBecause the stator is directly connected to the 50-Hz grid, this\nmeans that the number of pole pairs is 40.\nThis only leaves space for two slots per pole per phase, both\nin the stator and the rotor. In a squirrel-cage induction generator,\nthis would lead to large additional losses, but in a wound-rotor\ninduction generator, this should be acceptable.\nThe magnetizing current of this induction machine is rather\nlarge due to the considerable air gap and the high number of pole\npairs. To reduce the magnetizing current to acceptable levels,\nthe slots are semiclosed and the air gap is made 2 mm, which\nrequires a high rigidity of the bearing(s) and the supporting\nstructures. Other dimensions are given in Table II.\nFig. 13. Characteristics of the DFIG1G.\nThe DFIG1G is controlled in the same way as the DFIG3G.\nFig. 13 depicts some results from the model as a function of\nthe wind speed: voltage, current, power, generator efficiency,\ngenerator system efficiency (including losses in the converter\nand the gearbox), and losses. The annual energy dissipation,\ndetermined from a combination of the losses with the Weibull\ndistribution, is also depicted in Fig. 13. Table II gives the annual\nenergy yield and the annual dissipation. It also gives cost esti-\nmates. The generator construction is assumed to cost C=60 000,\nwhich is 20% more than the generator construction of the single-\nstage GPM generator, because the generator is heavier and has\na smaller air gap.\nIV. COMPARISON AND DISCUSSION\nThe DFIG3G is the lightest, low cost solution with standard\ncomponents, explaining why it is most widely-used commer-\ncially. However, it has a low energy yield due to the high losses\nin the gearbox. Because it is mainly built from standard com-\nponents consisting of copper and iron, major improvements in\nperformance or cost reductions cannot be expected.\nThe DDSG appears to be the heaviest, and most expensive\nalternative. The only commercially successful large direct-drive\nwind turbine manufacturer, Enercon, uses this system but they\nclaim other benefits from the system.\nThe DDPMG generator seems much more attractive because\nthe active material weight of the generator for the same air-gap\ndiameter is nearly halved, while the energy yield is a few percent\nhigher. It has the highest energy yield. However, compared to the\ngenerator systems with gearbox, it is more expensive. Further\nimprovements of this generator system may be expected because\nthe cost of the permanent magnets and the power electronics is\ndecreasing and because further optimization and integration of\nthe generator system is possible [3], [18], [19].\nThe GPM1G is an interesting option, especially if this ma-\nchine can also be used in other applications (for example, for\nship propulsion) so that the development cost can be shared.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Sketch of a Zephyros nacelle with a single bearing. Source: Zephyros\nBV.\nSurprisingly, the DFIG1G seems the most interesting choice\nin terms of energy yield divided by cost. This is mainly due to\nthe lower rating of the converter, resulting in a reduction of the\nconverter cost and the converter losses. However, this system\nmay be too special to be attractive for manufacturers.\nVery important design aspects for which further work is\nneeded are reliability and availability [20]. These are increas-\ningly important issues for wind turbines, especially for the off-\nshore ones. Manufacturers supplying the DFIG3G use gener-\nator and converter components which are close to industrial\nstandards yielding benefits in standardization, cost, and reli-\nability. However, this system has wearing components as the\ngearbox and the brushes. The DDSG with electrical excitation\nused by Enercon claims improved reliability including immu-\nnity to problems from voltage disturbances due to grid faults as\na result of the use of a fully rated converter. In principle, the\nDDPMG could be the best solution because it does not have\nbrushes or a gearbox that wears and it has the advantages of a\nfully rated converter.\nAnother aspect that has not been considered in this paper is\nthat of integral design. An integral design of the turbine and the\ngenerator system including manufacturing, transportation, and\ninstallation may considerably affect the price of a wind turbine.\nFig. 14 depicts an example of a nacelle where attention has been\npaid to the integration of the electromagnetic, mechanical, and\nthermal functions in the design [8].\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
