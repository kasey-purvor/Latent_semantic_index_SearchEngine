A literature review was\nconducted, a draft list of accessibility indicators was created, examples of applications of the\nindicators in existing distance learning programs were collected, the indicators were systematically\napplied to one distance learning program, input from a variety of distance learning programs was\nused to further refine the indicators, and these programs were encouraged to adopt the indicators\nand make use of resources provided by the project. Results of this exploratory work suggest that\nincorporating accessibility considerations into policies, procedures and communications of a\nprogram requires consideration of the unique needs of students, course designers, instructors and\nevaluators; involves approval and implementation at a variety of administrative levels; and is an\nongoing process that may be implemented in incremental steps.\nIntroduction\nThe widespread availability of the Internet has led to a worldwide explosion of\ndistance learning (e-learning or online learning) offerings (Waits & Lewis, 2003).\nAlthough some claim online learning will bring education to anyone anywhere at\nanytime, this goal cannot be realized unless distance-learning programs offer courses\nthat are accessible to all potential students, including those with disabilities. A review\nof the literature on distance learning suggests that people with disabilities are rarely\nconsidered in the design of distance learning courses (Kinash et al., 2004). For exam-\nple, benchmarks for the success of Internet-based distance learning programs identi-\nfied in a study by the Institute for Higher Education Policy (2000) were grouped into\nseven areas\u2014institutional support, course development, teaching\/learning, course\nstructure, student support, faculty support, and evaluation and assessment. Although\n*Box 355670, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA. Email: sherylb@u.washing-\nton.edu\n80 S. Burgstahler\nthere are disability-related issues within each of these benchmark categories (e.g.\nstudent support: how can programs address the unique support needs of students\nwith disabilities?), none are explicitly discussed in the study report. Similarly, a recent\nreview of distance learning literature led to the identification of 32 trends in distance\nlearning that can help administrators in program planning; they were organized into\nthe categories of students and enrollment, faculty members, academics, technology,\nthe economy, and distance learning. Relevant accessibility issues were not discussed\nin the report of findings (Howell et al., 2003). However, a consistent message in the\nrelatively small body of literature on e-learning and people with disabilities is that\nmaking courses accessible to students with disabilities not only assures their civil right\nto access, but promotes best practices in online learning for all students (Opitz, 2002;\nKinash, et al., 2004).\nBased on years of application and writing in this field (some of which is\ndocumented in Kinash et al. [2004]), I propose that at least four conditions make\naccessibility an important topic for distance learning program administrators to\naddress: \n1. Many people consider it unethical to bar some eligible participants from program\naccess.\n2. Legislation mandates that programs be accessible to qualified people with disabil-\nities.\n3. Applying accessible design principles is considered a best practice for all students.\n4. Costly redesign may be required when a student with a disability enrolls in an\ninaccessible course.\nIn the following sections I provide an overview of disability-related access chal-\nlenges and solutions, legal issues, universal design, and accessibility guidelines and\nstandards. These sections are followed by a report of a research study that explored\npolicy and practice issues related to the accessible design of distance learning\nprograms in the United States.\nAccess challenges and solutions\nToday, assistive technology makes it possible for individuals with almost any types of\ndisabilities to operate computers (Closing the Gap, 2005). Such assistive technology\nincludes text-to-speech software for individuals who are blind or who have reading-\nrelated disabilities, alternative keyboards and mice for people who have mobility\nimpairments, and specialized software for students with learning disabilities.\nHowever, the inaccessible design of electronic materials can erect barriers even to\nstudents who have access to assistive technology (National Council on Disability,\n2004). For example, text-to-speech software reads aloud text that appears on the\nscreen and, therefore, provides access to only the content of electronic resources that\nare provided in text formats. Distance learning designers can avoid erecting barriers\nto students who are blind by providing text alternatives such as <alt> tags to fully\ndescribe the content presented in graphic images. Similarly, text-only versions of\nAccessibility indicators for distance learning programs 81\ndocuments in Portable Document Format (pdf) make their content accessible to indi-\nviduals who are blind and captions on video presentations make them accessible to\nstudents who are deaf.\nSome distance learning tools need to be avoided or used in limited ways to prevent\naccessibility barriers. For example, real-time chat and other tools that allow students\nto communicate synchronously (at the same time) are difficult or impossible to use\nby someone whose input method is slow, perhaps because of limited hand function\nor a learning disability, and some synchronous tools are not accessible to those who\nare blind. Similarly, standard telephone conferencing is inaccessible to students who\nare deaf or have speech impairments. An instructor who allows students to use a\nsynchronous tool for small group discussions should require that members of a group\nuse an alternative, such as electronic mail or a discussion forum, when the synchro-\nnous tool is not accessible to all participants. It should be noted, however, that,\nalthough inaccessibility due to disability-related issues is one reason why a synchro-\nnous tool might not be accessible to everyone in a group, a more common barrier is\nsimply the inability of a group to agree on a specific time to meet. Providing an\nasynchronous option addresses all of these access issues.\nMost publications about distance learning course development do not discuss\nuniversal design or address specific access issues for people with disabilities (Kinash\net al., 2004); there are few exceptions (for example, Burgstahler, 1997; Schmetzke,\n2001; Waits & Lewis, 2003). In addition, few published works that consider accessi-\nbility discuss access issues for the wide range of technologies and strategies currently\nused in distance learning courses (for example, Kessler & Keefe, 1999; Burgstahler,\n2000, 2002). Not surprisingly, many courses are not accessible to people with some\ntypes of disabilities. In a recent study, although almost all postsecondary institutions\nsurveyed used websites for distance education courses, only 18% indicated that they\nfollowed established accessibility guidelines to a major extent; 28% followed guide-\nlines to a moderate extent, 18% followed guidelines to a minor extent, 3% did not\nfollow guidelines at all, and 33% did not know if the websites adhered to accessibility\nguidelines (Waits & Lewis, 2003).\nToday, since most distance learning courses are not fully accessible to students with\ndisabilities, any disability-related adjustments to the course would need to be made\nwhen a student with a disability enrolls in a course; in other words, \u2018accommodations\u2019\nfor the individual student would be provided. Planning for access as distance learning\ncourses are being developed is potentially easier and therefore less expensive than\nquickly developing accommodation strategies each time a student with a disability\nenrolls in a course. The process of making decisions while a course is being developed\nto assure that it is accessible to potential students with a wide range of abilities, disabil-\nities, learning styles, and other characteristics is called universal design (UD).\nUD is defined by the Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State Univer-\nsity as \u2018the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the\ngreatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design\u2019 (North\nCarolina State University, 1997). The Center established a set of principles that\nprovide guidance in the design of products and environments (Anders & Fechtner,\n82 S. Burgstahler\n1992). Universally designed buildings can be comfortably and inclusively used by\nthose who walk independently, push baby strollers, walk with crutches and use wheel-\nchairs.\nUD has been applied to many products (e.g. educational software, websites, text-\nbooks, laboratory equipment) and environments (e.g. classrooms, libraries, muse-\nums, dormitories, distance learning courses) in education (Disabilities,\nOpportunities, Internetworking, and Technology [DO-IT], undated b; Preiser &\nOstroff, 2001). The Center for Applied Special Technology has focused attention on\nthe application of UD to technology-based curriculum, defining UD for learning as\n\u2018a research-based set of principles that together form a practical framework for using\ntechnology to maximize learning opportunities for every student\u2019 (Rose & Meyer,\n2002, p. 5). Applying the results of brain research and the capabilities of information\ntechnology (IT), the Center for Applied Special Technology identifies three essential\nqualities of curriculum that applies UD for learning\u2014multiple means of representa-\ntion, expression and engagement (ERIC\/OSEP, 1998; Rose & Meyer, 2002). Several\nresearchers have developed principles and performance indicators for the UD of\ninstruction (Silver et al., 1998; Scott et al., 2003; Burgstahler, 2005; Mason & Orkwis,\n2005) that demonstrate how UD can be applied to all aspects of instruction, includ-\ning class climate, physical access and usability, safety, delivery methods, information\nresources, interaction, feedback and assessment (Burgstahler, 2005).\nSimilarly, distance-learning courses that incorporate UD features can be accessed\nby students with diverse characteristics, including those defined by age, race, ethnic-\nity, gender, native language, and level of ability to hear, see, move and speak\n(Schmetzke, 2001; Burgstahler, 2002; Burgstahler et al., 2004; National Council on\nDisability, 2004).\nLegal issues, standards, and guidelines\nSection 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandates that qualified\npeople with disabilities in the United States have access to programs and services that\nreceive federal funds. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) reinforced\nand extended the mandates of Section 504 and prohibits institutions from excluding\nand otherwise discriminating against people with disabilities in public programs and\nservices, regardless of whether or not these programs and services are federally funded\n(Edmonds, 2004). In 1996, the US Department of Justice (Patrick, 1996, p. 1)\nclarified that ADA accessibility requirements apply to programs offered on the Inter-\nnet by stating: \u2018Covered entities that use the Internet for communications regarding\ntheir programs, goods, or services must be prepared to offer those communications\nthrough accessible means as well\u2019. Specifically, if qualified individuals with disabilities\nenroll in distance learning courses offered via the Internet, these courses should be\nmade accessible to them.\nSection 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires that IT which US federal\nagencies procure, develop, maintain and use be accessible to people with disabilities,\nboth employees and members of the public, unless it would pose an undue burden to\nAccessibility indicators for distance learning programs 83\ndo so. As mandated in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 (US Department\nof Education, 1998), the US Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance\nBoard developed accessibility standards for technology to which federal agencies must\ncomply. The standards include criteria for making webpages and other Internet tools\naccessible (Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, 2000).\nAlthough this law applies directly to federal agencies, many states, post-secondary\ninstitutions and other entities have adopted Section 508 standards as one effort to\nmeet their obligations under the ADA. The Web Accessibility Initiative of the World\nWide Web Consortium has developed more comprehensive Web Content Accessibil-\nity Guidelines (World Wide Web Consortium, 1999, 2003) that tell how to design\nwebpages accessible to people with disabilities. Both the Section 508 standards and\nthe Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines were guided by universal design principles.\nDistance learning programs can benefit from following the leadership of the US\nfederal government in being both proactive and reactive, rather than only reactive\nregarding accessibility issues: \nUse of an \u2018ad hoc\u2019 or \u2018as needed\u2019 approach to IT accessibility will result in barriers for\npersons with disabilities. A much better approach is to integrate accessibility reviews into\nthe earliest stages of design, development, and procurement of IT. (US Department of\nJustice, 2000)\nBeing both proactive (by applying universal design principles) and reactive (by\nproviding accommodations) in offering courses results in more inclusive programs\nand minimizes the need for accommodations for specific students.\nIn 1999, the California Community Colleges developed the first comprehensive\ndistance learning guidelines in response to a 1998 ADA compliance review by the US\nOffice of Civil Rights (California Community Colleges Chancellor\u2019s Office, 1999).\nThe \u2018Distance Education Access Guidelines\u2019 are for print media, audio conferencing,\nvideo conferencing\/video transmission, software and web resources (based on the\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines). Other distance learning programs have\ndeveloped accessibility policies that encourage or demand compliance with Section\n508 standards and\/or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. The Michigan Virtual\nUniversity (2002) distance learning program provides an example of how accessibility\nguidelines are integrated into overall course design standards. Its \u2018Standards for\nQuality Online Courses\u2019 includes four subsections\u2014technology, usability, accessibil-\nity and instructional design. Based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, the\naccessibility categories include basic content, tables\/frames, and media.\nThe study\nA study was undertaken to explore program policies and practices related to making\ndistance learning courses accessible to qualified students with disabilities. The\nresearch question was: \nWhat are program-level policies and practices related to delivering courses that are fully\naccessible to students with disabilities?\n84 S. Burgstahler\nResearch methods\nThe goals of this exploratory research were to create and refine a list of distance learn-\ning program accessibility indicators, to test their application in existing programs, and\nto recommend research and other activities to further this work beyond the explor-\natory level. The steps employed in this study were to: \n1. build a draft list of accessibility indicators based on prior work;\n2. collect examples of applications of the indicators in existing distance learning\nprograms;\n3. systematically apply the indicators to one distance learning program; and\n4. gather input from a variety of distance learning programs to further refine the\nindicators, as well as encourage these institutions to adopt the indicators.\nBased on experiences in creating accessible distance learning courses (Burgstahler,\n2000), collaboration with the University of Washington (UW) Distance Learning\nprogram in making its courses accessible (Burgstahler et al., 2004), and work with\ndisabled student services and distance learning administrators nationwide, I identi-\nfied and published steps toward improving the accessibility of distance learning\nprograms. Actions included the development of policies, procedures and guidelines;\nthe dissemination of information to stakeholders; and the provision of ongoing train-\ning, technical support and evaluation (Burgstahler, 2002). In collaboration with UW\nDistance Learning administrators, a case study of our work was developed and\npublished (Burgstahler et al., 2004). Building on this work, I drafted an initial list of\n\u2018Distance Learning Program Accessibility Indicators\u2019 (DLP Accessibility Indicators)\nthat could be used as a checklist for documenting programmatic changes that lead to\nthe improved accessibility of the courses of any distance learning program.\nA staff member from the UW Distance Learning Program was assigned to work with\ndistance learning programs at institutions whose disabled student service directors\nwere part of projects funded by the US Department of Education (grant\n#P333A020044 and #P333A990042) and directed by DO-IT (undated b) at the\nUniversity of Washington. The larger project focused on faculty and staff training at\npost-secondary institutions in an effort to improve the post-secondary academic and\ncareer outcomes for students with disabilities nationwide. Of the 23 schools repre-\nsented in this grant-funded project, 18 had distance-learning programs that offered\ncourses primarily at a distance and in multiple academic areas. Distance learning\nadministrators of two of these 18 schools declined to participate in our exploratory\nwork, resulting in an 89% participation rate.\nThe 16 participating schools possess a wide range of institutional characteristics:\nlarge and small schools; two-year institutions (five schools) and four-year institutions\n(11 schools); and schools from rural, suburban and urban areas. At the time of the\nstudy, 14 schools offered primarily web-based distance learning courses, and two\nused primarily teleconferencing technology. Working 20 hours per week for one year,\nthe staff person dedicated to this project contacted distance learning professionals at\nthe 16 participating schools to: \nAccessibility indicators for distance learning programs 85\n\u25cf share the \u2018DLP Accessibility Indicators\u2019, web resources and DO-IT publications\nand training videos to increase participant awareness of accessibility issues and\nsolutions;\n\u25cf encourage schools to join an electronic discussion list focused on the accessibility\nof distance learning courses;\n\u25cf collect and share examples of each indicator applied at other institutions as models\nfor participants to consider;\n\u25cf perform accessibility reviews of distance learning webpages and offer suggestions\nfor improvements regarding accessibility; and\n\u25cf encourage participants to adopt the indicators at their schools.\nThis person helped develop a website and electronic discussion list as part of\n\u2018AccessDL\u2019, the National Center on Accessible Distance Learning (DO-IT, 2004),\nmaintained records of the implementation of the indicators at the 16 participating\nschools, and continued the accessibility efforts at the UW Distance Learning\nprogram, where she had worked for many years.\nOver a period of one year, the DLP Accessibility Indicators were refined through\nformative feedback from participants within an iterative process. Periodically I would\nshare the current list of indicators via email, telephone conferences and in-person\nmeetings with participants in the larger funded project. They were asked to give\nfeedback on the overall breadth of the indicator list, the stakeholders to which each\nindicator applied and the clarity of each indicator on the list. Whenever modified, the\nlist was shared again and further feedback was solicited. In addition, the project staff\nmember assigned to sharing the indicators with the distance learning staff of partici-\npating schools recorded and shared with me responses of the individuals with whom\nhe\/she communicated, and this input was considered when the indicator list was\nedited for clarity and completeness.\nResearch results, phases one and two: examples of applications of the \nindicators\nEach DLP Accessibility Indicator developed in this study and listed in the next\nsection of this article relates to one of four key stakeholders in the delivery of distance\nlearning courses: \n1. Students and potential students.\n2. Distance learning designers.\n3. Distance learning instructors.\n4. Distance learning program evaluators.\nOn many campuses, particularly those with small distance learning programs, one\nperson may perform more than one role. The DLP Accessibility Indicators developed\nin this study are presented in Table 1. Examples to illustrate these indicators are\npresented in the following paragraphs. They are drawn from institutions with a variety\nof characteristics and shed light on how the indicators might be applied in distance\n86 S. Burgstahler\nlearning programs. Inclusion of a specific example does not, however, imply a recom-\nmendation or endorsement. It should also be noted that websites used as examples\nmay have undergone changes since this article was published. Although the quota-\ntions provided here still serve as examples of the indicators, they may no longer reflect\nthe content of the webpages referenced.\nIndicators that focus on students and potential students\nDLP Accessibility Indicators 1\u20135 focus on students and potential students, and are\nbased on the premise that distance learning programs committed to accessibility\nassure that students and potential students know of the programs\u2019 commitment to\naccessible design, how to report inaccessible design features they discover, how to\nrequest accommodations and how to obtain alternate formats of printed materials;\nTable 1.

When properly designed, web pages facilitate an inclusive environment and\nculture, and enhance learning, teaching, research, scholarship, creativity, and public\nservice and outreach. When improperly designed, without regard for the needs and\nabilities of our diverse community, web pages may become barriers that can block our\neducational commitment.\nA comprehensive, formal web accessibility policy is the key to ensuring that web resources\nare accessible, usable, understandable, and navigable. Such a policy signifies that the\nUniversity of Iowa values all of its members and provides tangible proof of the University\u2019s\ncommitment to empowering people and promoting their independence. This policy\nestablishes minimum standards for achieving these goals in a manner that preserves the\nfreedom of designers and developers to create cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, well-designed\npages, resources, and services.\nThe University of Wisconsin Madison \u2018Accessibility\u2019 website7 includes this\nstatement: \nThe UW Policy is an effort to make the web more accessible for people with vision, hear-\ning or other disabilities. \u2026 We are committed to help you make your web pages accessi-\nble. Whether you are a web master, an instructor with a course on the web, or a\ndepartment administrator, we can help.

Training for UW distance learning designers includes\na session on legal and technical accessibility issues and Section 508 standards.\nInitially, this training was delivered to UW distance learning instructional designers\nby DO-IT. Now accessibility is integrated into ongoing training for designers\nprovided by program staff. DO-IT and the Access Technology Lab8 provide ongoing\ntechnical support via email and telephone.\nIndicators that focus on distance learning instructors\nDLP Accessibility Indicators 8 and 9 are based on the premise that, in distance learn-\ning programs committed to accessibility, publications and webpages for distance\nlearning, instructors include a statement of the distance learning program\u2019s commit-\nment to accessibility, guidelines regarding accessibility, and resources and training for\ninstructors including accessibility content.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 8.   The \u2018Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication\nSystem\u2019 website includes resource links, as well as policies and guidelines that\n\u2018address distance learning and the use of technology in the classroom from the faculty\nperspective of teaching and learning\u2019. In addition, within the \u2018Course Design\u2019 section\nof \u2018Faculty Benchmarks and Principles\u20199 is this statement: \nDistance learning courses will be carefully planned to meet the needs of students within\nunique learning contexts and environments.\nThe University of Maryland University College website entitled \u2018Accessibility in\nDistance Education: A Resource for Faculty in Online Teaching\u201910 includes the\nfollowing introductory statement: \nThe Accessibility in Distance Education (ADE) Web site focuses on helping faculty\ndevelop accessible online learning materials for people with disabilities. It is divided into\nfive major sections, targeting common accessibility questions.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 9.   A website at Cal State San Marcos entitled \u2018Web\nAccessibility: Applying ADA Principles to Online Teaching and Learning\u201911 includes\ncontent and resources from a faculty training session.\nIndicators that focus on program evaluators\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 10 is based on the premise that distance learning\nprograms committed to accessibility have systems in place to monitor accessibility\nefforts and make adjustments based on evaluation results.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 10.   An example of Indicator 10 is where the UW applies\nquality assurance tests to all of its courses before they are published. Included in this\n90 S. Burgstahler\nprocess is an accessibility review. Barriers to accessibility discovered in the review are\nrecorded and removed as the course is updated.\nResearch results, phase three: application of the \u2018Indicators\u2019 at the UW \nDistance Learning Program\nThe efforts of the UW Distance Learning Program to develop and apply accessibility\npolicies and procedures helped to conceptualize, develop and test the feasibility of the\n10 \u2018Distance Learning Program Accessibility Indicators\u2019 reported in this article\n(Burgstahler et al., 2004). This program uses a course delivery system that was for the\nmost part developed at the university. It set a goal to improve the overall accessibility\nof its online courses, thus maximizing program access and minimizing the need for\nspecial accommodations. A report of the UW Distance Learning Program accessibil-\nity efforts is summarized in the following.\nIndicators that focus on students and prospective students\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 1.   With the assistance of DO-IT and UW Access\nTechnology Lab (undated) staff, the UW central computing organization, Comput-\ning & Communications, developed a website devoted to guidelines and resources for\nmaking campus webpages accessible (see \u2018The Goal: Making UW Web Sites Acces-\nsible to Everyone\u201912), first pointing to Section 508 standards as campus guidelines\nand then to the more in-depth guidelines and resources, including those provided by\nthe World Wide Web Consortium. Although, at the time of publication of this article,\nthe \u2018UW Online Learning\u2019 homepage13 does not yet meet all of the Section 508\nstandards, efforts are ongoing. Progress is slow, in part because the distance learning\nprogram staff involved in the reported project are not responsible for the development\nand maintenance of this site. However, the two units continue to work together and\nhope to make accessibility adjustments during the next revision cycle.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 2.   A statement about the UW Distance Learning\nProgram\u2019s commitment to accessible design for all potential students is included in\nappropriate publications and websites, along with contact information for reporting\ninaccessible design features. For example, within the \u2018Online Student Handbook:\nGetting Started\u201914 is the following question and answer: \nAre online learning courses accessible to students with disabilities? We strive to make our\nonline courses accessible to everyone. We specifically consider design features that make\nour courses accessible to individuals with disabilities, including those using assistive tech-\nnology for computer access. If you find a feature\/course inaccessible to you, please\ncontact Online Learning Technical Support (linked to contact information at http:\/\/\nwww.extension.washington.edu\/ol\/handbook\/contact.asp#pss).\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 3.   A statement about how students with disabilities can\nrequest accommodations is included in appropriate publications and webpages. For\nAccessibility indicators for distance learning programs 91\nexample, the UW Extension website15 and the \u2018Online Student Handbook: Addi-\ntional Resources and Information\u201916 include the following information: \nThe University of Washington is committed to providing access, equal opportunity and\nreasonable accommodation in its services, programs, activities, education and employment\nfor individuals with disabilities. To request disability accommodation, contact the Disability\nServices office at 206-543-6450\/voice, 206-543-6452\/TTY, 206-685-7264 (fax), or e-mail\ndso@u.washington.edu at least 10 days prior to the start of your course or examination.\nYou may also request accommodation in the certificate program application process by\ncontacting Disability Services at least 10 days before you submit your application.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 4.   A statement about how people can obtain alternate\nformats of printed materials is included in UW Extension publications that promote\ndistance learning courses.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 5.   To help assure that UW online and other course mate-\nrials are accessible to students with disabilities, the Distance Learning Design Depart-\nment of the UW Extension Program has designed a template for their online courses\nthat specifically addresses accessibility issues.\nIndicators that focus on distance learning designers\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 6.   Publications and webpages for UW Distance Learning\ncourse designers include: a statement of the program\u2019s commitment to accessibility,\nguidelines\/standards regarding accessibility, and resources. In the UW Extension\nDistance Learning Design Department, the following statement for instructional\ndesigners is found on the department\u2019s Intranet: \nWe are responsible for creating Web pages that are accessible to users with visual, auditory,\nand\/or motor impairments. People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to read\nWeb pages aloud, and our HTML must be formatted so that screen readers can follow it.\nFor people with auditory disabilities, transcripts of auditory files must be provided (speech\nto text software makes this relatively easy). Our navigation must be such that people with\nmotor disabilities are able to follow links.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 7.   Accessibility issues are covered in regular course\ndesigner training. A two-hour session on legal and technical accessibility issues and\nSection 508 standards was delivered to UW Distance Learning Instructional Design-\ners by DO-IT,17 and the UW Access Technology Lab18 provide ongoing technical\nsupport via email and telephone.\nIndicators that focus on distance learning instructors\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 8.   Publications and webpages for UW Distance Learning\ninstructors include: a statement of the distance learning program\u2019s commitment to\n92 S. Burgstahler\naccessibility, guidelines\/standards regarding accessibility, and resources. UW Exten-\nsion staff have created an \u2018Online Instructor Handbook\u2019 that includes the following\ninformation:19 \nUWEO course materials are designed to comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation\nAct Amendments of 1998. Course materials are accessible to students who are blind or\nhave low vision, who cannot navigate using a mouse, or who have a hearing impairment.\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 9.   Accessibility issues are covered in training sessions for\ninstructors. For example, the UW \u2018Online Learning Instructors Handbook\u2019 contains\naccommodation request information and instructions about how to address accessi-\nbility barriers in their courses.20,21\nIn addition, each quarter the UW Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology\noffers a Web Design Workshop on Accessibility and Usability that is free to campus\neducators, including faculty, librarians, instructors, teaching assistants and instruc-\ntional staff. Accessibility is also integrated within web design courses.\nIndicators for program evaluators\nDLP Accessibility Indicator 10.   At the UW, a system is in place to monitor the acces-\nsibility of courses, and, on the basis of this evaluation, the program takes actions to\nimprove the accessibility of specific courses and to update information and training\ngiven to potential students, students, course designers and instructors. Specifically,\nwithin the program\u2019s quality assurance tests of all new courses before they are offered,\naccessibility barriers are identified and addressed.\nResearch results, phase four: outreach to distance learning programs\nOnly two of the 18 schools that had distance learning programs declined to partici-\npate in this work, yielding a high participation rate (89%). All of the 16 distance learn-\ning programs contacted in this study were given informative publications, web\nresources and training videos from DO-IT to help them in their own efforts to make\ntheir courses more accessible; they were invited to join a discussion list (DO-IT,\n2004) for ongoing communication regarding the accessibility of distance learning\ncourses. All participating schools were enthusiastic about receiving materials and\nhaving access to the \u2018AccessDL\u2019 website developed in the project. At 10 of the 16\nparticipating schools, one or more distance learning staff members joined a discussion\nlist on accessibility of distance learning courses. Participants also expressed an inter-\nest in linking their distance learning staff to the \u2018AccessDL\u2019 website (DO-IT, 2004).\nTable 2 summarizes the beginning state and the ending state regarding implemen-\ntation of each indicator, where \u2018Y\u2019 means yes an indicator was applied, \u2018S\u2019 means it\nwas applied to some extent but not fully, and \u2018N\u2019 means it was not yet applied. When\nonly one of these characters appears in the table it means that the state did not change\nfrom the beginning to the end of the study.

Burgstahler\nmeans that the state of an indicator changed from the first state to the second. Blank\ncells indicate that the state of the indicator was not known by research staff. The final\ncolumn includes the total number of known changes to indicators that were made by\neach institution from the beginning to the end of the study. The state of six indicators\nwas changed by one institution; four by two institutions, two by one institution, and\none by two institutions. It should be noted that changes made at three schools\n(institutions 7, 10 and 13) accounted for 14 (78%) of the changes overall.\nTable 3 presents, for each indicator, the number of schools whose indicator state\nwas Y or S at the beginning of the study, the number of schools whose indicator state\nwas Y or S at the end of the study, and the difference between these two figures, which\nindicates the number of schools for which this indicator changed from N (not\napplied) to Y or S (applied to some degree) during the course of the study. A total of\n16 changes in the state of indicators occurred from the beginning to the end of the\nstudy, all in a positive direction. The state of DLP Accessibility Indicators 3, 4, and\n5 did not change at any school. Each of the other indicators was changed in a positive\ndirection in at least one participating school. DLP Accessibility Indicators 2, 6 and 8\nwere changed in a positive direction at three schools; DLP Accessibility Indicators 1,\n9 and 10 changed at two schools. This means that a total of five changes were made\nin the five indicators of change for students and potential students, three in the two\nindicators for distance learning designers, five in the two indicators for distance learn-\ning instructors, and two in the one indicator for program evaluators.\nAs revealed in Tables 2 and 3, at the beginning of this exploratory study the 16\nparticipating schools had implemented a total of 48 indicators, at least partially,\nrepresenting an average of three per school; at the end of the study, they had\nTable 3.

Thus, each school gained an average of one indicator during the year of this\nexploratory study. Six of the 16 schools (38%) included in the study changed at least\none indicator in a positive direction (e.g. N to S or Y; or S to Y) at their schools from\nthe beginning to the end of this study. Although 12 schools indicated that their\ndistance learning courses were to some degree accessible (DLP Accessibility Indica-\ntor 5), no testing of course materials was conducted by research staff.\nIt should be noted that some participants took concrete steps that did not result in\nthe change of an indicator. For example, some made improvements in the accessibil-\nity of their homepages that were not in areas captured by the Section 508 standards,\nsuch as improving the descriptive text for content in graphic images. They may have\nalso made changes of which project staff were unaware (e.g. changing wording in a\nprogram catalog) or that did not represent enough improvements to change an\nindicator from \u2018no\u2019 to \u2018some\u2019 or \u2018yes\u2019. Some participants suggested that the DLP\nAccessibility Indicator list be expanded in such a way that small, positive changes\ncould be documented. Anecdotal information gathered by the project staff member\nsuggests that improvements in accessibility are slow and ongoing. Several contacts\nand conversations were often required for a program to take action that resulted in a\nchange in the state of one indicator.\nThe enthusiasm in receiving DO-IT instructional materials and in communicating\nwith project staff by all participating schools, as reported by the staff member assigned\nto working with these programs, suggests increased awareness, interest and skills that\nmay lead to ongoing, systemic changes in the distance learning programs involved in\nthe project. In most cases, project participation resulted in opening or increasing\ncommunications between staff from disability services, distance learning and\ncomputing services. Most distance learning staff in participating schools expressed a\ncommitment to continue to improve course accessibility.\nDiscussion\nThe reported study was undertaken to explore program policies and practices related\nto the accessibility of distance learning courses to qualified students with disabilities\nin the United States. Seventeen post-secondary institutions in the United States were\ninvolved in this exploratory study. The following steps were taken: building a draft list\nof accessibility indicators, collecting examples of applications of the indicators in\nexisting distance learning programs, systematically applying the indicators to one\ndistance learning program, and gathering input from 16 other distance learning\nprograms to further refine the indicators, as well as encourage these institutions to\nadopt the indicators.\n\u2018Distance Learning Program Accessibility Indicators\u2019 were drafted and refined and\nexamples of applications of the indicators were collected. The staff member assigned\nto communicate with participants in this exploratory study reported that it was difficult\nto find examples of the \u2018DLP Accessibility Indicators\u2019, suggesting that many schools\nare not dealing with accessibility issues in policies and practices. It should be noted,\n96 S. Burgstahler\nhowever, that the state of some of the indicators cannot be determined by inspection\nof a program\u2019s public web resources. Supporting these reported experiences is the fact\nthat an average of only 3.3 of the 10 indicators (33%) were found to be implemented\nto some degree at participating schools as the project began. These findings are consis-\ntent with published literature that concludes that students with disabilities are rarely\nconsidered in the design of distance learning courses (Kinash et al., 2004).\nExperiences with both the case study and the outreach efforts of this research suggest\nthat implementing change is slow, but implementation by staff within a distance learn-\ning program who are committed to accessibility and where the distance learning\nprogram administrator is supportive is easier than when this staff member contacts\nprogram staff at other schools in an effort to improve the accessibility of their programs.\nIt should be noted, however, that the case study reports on work that was in the making\nmore than twice as long as those in the outreach efforts, and therefore results are not\ndirectly comparable. These findings are consistent with literature that concludes\nsystemic change is often a slow process (Bruce & Wyman, 1998; Guy & Oliver, 1998).\nThe staff member working on this effort reported that several communications and\ntime to review materials sent were required to obtain the needed buy-in in order for\nprogrammatic changes to be made. Sometimes, several distance learning staff\nmembers were consulted before the correct person who could make specific program-\nmatic changes was consulted, and this person was not the same for each indicator.\nThe fact that changes made at three (19%) of the participating schools accounted for\n78% of the overall known changes made coupled with reports from research staff\nsuggest that, once a program commits to making one change, further changes come\nmore quickly. That initial buy-in is a key step in the process of making significant\nprogrammatic changes related to accessibility.\nIt was also reported by project staff that the idea of accessibility, once understood,\nwas enthusiastically received by most of the distance learning program staff  members\ncontacted. They also expressed appreciation for printed publications, videos, web\nresources and the discussion list made available to them through DO-IT. Lack of\ntime to address accessibility issues and the need to work with other staff were the\nmost commonly reported reasons for not implementing specific \u2018DLP Accessibility\nIndicators\u2019.\nIn summary, the results of this exploratory study suggest that incorporating acces-\nsibility considerations in policies, procedures and communications of a program: \n\u25cf requires efforts related to students, course designers, instructors and evaluators;\n\u25cf requires approval and implementation at a variety of staff levels;\n\u25cf moves more quickly once one change is made; and\n\u25cf is an ongoing process that may be implemented in incremental steps.\nLimitations of the study\nLimitations of this study are related to the fact that the research was, by design,\nexploratory in nature and therefore lacked some of the characteristics of a more\nAccessibility indicators for distance learning programs 97\ncontrolled research study. For example, a limitation of this work is that participating\nschools were not selected randomly, but rather were made up a sample of conve-\nnience. The UW and the other institutions of the 16 distance learning programs that\nparticipated in this exploratory study were part of a larger project funded by the US\nDepartment of Education.\nAnother limitation is that, although participants gained support from the staff\nmember assigned to this work, from shared resources and from one another through\ndiscussion lists, no attempt was made to quantify the types and levels of support\nactually used by each school. Interaction with participants was informal and inconsis-\ntent from school to school; project staff worked the most with schools most interested\nin working with them; and, since only one staff member made contacts with the\ndistance learning programs, the potential amount of support was related to the order\nin which contacts with schools were made. In addition, the indicator list may not\nreflect incremental programmatic changes and did not capture increased awareness\nthat might eventually result in program change.\nMuch of the data collected in this exploratory study relied on self-report; some\nprogram staff might have given statements in order to put their programs in a positive\nlight with respect to being accessible to students with disabilities. Their responses\nmay also be inaccurate because of a limited understanding of accessibility issues. All\nof these limitations might have had an impact on the accuracy of the results; there-\nfore, this exploratory study should be interpreted with caution.\nFuture research and outreach activities\nDO-IT continues to support the discussion lists and the website discussed in this\nreport as part of its National Center on Accessible Distance Learning (AccessDL),\nwhich is now funded by a new grant from the Office of Postsecondary Education in\nthe US Department of Education (#P333A50064) that are now open to anyone inter-\nested in these topics (DO-IT, 2004).\nNow that draft \u2018DLP Accessibility Indicators\u2019 have been developed, potential next\nsteps in ongoing efforts include the following: \n1. Further validate the indicators. One approach would be to conduct a formal\nDelphi process with distance education experts to further refine and validate the\nindicators and, perhaps, to add substeps to the list to promote greater under-\nstanding of each category and to track specific efforts within a given category.\nThe Delphi method is well suited to better understanding a narrowly defined\nissue, such as accessibility. It is a structured process for collecting and distilling\nknowledge from a group of experts, using a series of questionnaires to gain feed-\nback from participants to facilitate the formation of a group judgment (Gordon,\n1994; Egan & Akdere, 2005).\n2. Involve specific stakeholders in the refinement and validation of the indicators.\nThis would include students with disabilities, instructors, distance learning\ndesigners and evaluators. Getting experiences and input from students with\n98 S. Burgstahler\ndisabilities is particularly important, since they are the potential consumers\nwithin the context of these studies.\n3. Expand the research to include institutions outside the United States.\n4. Design further studies to explore the following research questions: \n\u25cf What are the promoters and inhibitors of systemic change to improve the\naccessibility of distance learning courses?\n\u25cf What are the current experiences, including benefits and challenges, of\nstudents with a variety of disabilities in accessing distance learning courses?\n\u25cf What are accessibility challenges faced by people with disabilities who are\ncurrent or potential designers or instructors of distance learning courses?\n\u25cf What technological tools and supports are available to help distance learning\ndesigners and faculty make their courses accessible to students with disabili-\nties, and what additional products and supports are needed?\nOther potential activities to promote the accessible design of distance learning\nprograms include the following: \n1. Disseminate information to encourage distance learning programs to take steps\nto make their courses accessible to students with disabilities.\n2. Encourage distance learning professional organizations to take a leadership role\nin promoting the development of accessible distance learning courses.\nConclusion\nDistance education creates learning opportunities for all qualified students when\naccessibility considerations are institutionalized into program policies, procedures\nand communications. Otherwise, distance learning courses can impose needless\nbarriers to equal participation in academics and careers for potential students and\ninstructors with disabilities. Employing UD principles as Internet-based distance\nlearning courses are created can bring us closer to making learning accessible to\nanyone, anywhere, at any time. It is important to develop a programmatic commit-\nment to accessibility as an ongoing effort: \na learning organization is a group of people pursuing common purposes \u2026 with a collec-\ntive commitment to regularly weighing the value of those purposes, modifying them when\nthat makes sense, and continually developing more effective and efficient ways of accom-\nplishing those purposes. (Leithwood et al., 1995, p. 5)\nDistance learning programs are encouraged to apply the \u2018Distance Learning Program\nAccessibility Indicators\u2019 presented in this report.
