This study was undertaken23\nto minimise these variations through optimising the three-point linkage of the tractor to improve24\nthe quality of soil spectra and the accuracy of plant available phosphorus (P-avl) measured with25\nan on-line soil sensor. The sensor consisted of a tine, to the back of which an optical probe was26\nattached to acquire soil spectra in diffusive reflectance mode from the bottom of the trench27\nopened by the tine. A mobile, fibre-type, Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Zeiss Corona 45 visnir28\nfibre, Germany), with a measurement range of 306.5 \u2013 1710.9 nm was used. Five lengths of the29\nthird point link (L) of the tractor of 545, 550, 555, 560 and 565 mm were selected to evaluate30\nthe quality of spectra collected on-line at 0.15 m tine depth. The on-line measured spectra were31\ncorrected to remove the effect of D and \uf061. The correction was evaluated by estimating the32\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n2\naccuracy of predicting P-avl using on-line measured spectra and a previously developed P-avl33\ncalibration model.34\nResults showed that the best quality of spectra measured on-line was obtained for L of 55535\nmm, at which D and \uf061 vanished. This finding was supported by the maximum value of average36\nmaximum reflectance (AMR) of 75.7% obtained and by 100% successfully collected spectra.37\nThe worst quality of spectra was obtained at L of 545 mm, with the largest D of 6 mm and the38\nlargest \uf061 of 0.6\u00b0. Values of L of 560 and 565 mm led to a decrease in the AMR (43.3 and39\n33.2%, respectively), while recording 100% successful spectra. Correction of on-line measured40\nspectra led to clear improvements in the accuracy of on-line measured P-avl. A lower root mean41\nsquare error (RMSE) of 1.07 mg 100g-1 and higher ratio of prediction deviations (RPD) of 1.4242\nwere obtained with corrected spectra as compared to uncorrected spectra (RMSE = 1.15 and43\nRPD = 1.39). In addition, the correction of spectra resulted in an increase in the degree of44\nsimilarity between laboratory and on-line measured P-avl maps by 29.6%. These results suggest45\nthe need for optimising the tractor hydraulic three-point linkage set up, and for spectra46\ncorrection in order to improve the accuracy of on-line measured soil properties.47\n48\nKeywords: visible; near infrared; spectrophotometer; on-line, soil sensor.49\n50\n1. Introduction51\n52\nVisible (Vis) and near infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy is a promising53\nmeasurement technique available to provide rapid information about soil physical and chemical54\nproperties, e.g. moisture, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium content; and cation55\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n3\nexchange capacity in an economical manner (Ben-Dor and Banin, 1995; Chang et al., 2001;56\nReeves and McCarty 2001; Odlare et al., 2005; Cozzolino and Mor\u00f3n, 2006; Maleki et al.,57\n2006a; Wetterlind et al., 2008). When light is illuminated towards the soil surface, the radiant58\nenergy is distributed through three different processes: reflection, absorbance and transmission59\n(Dahm and Dahm, 2001). Since transmission for opaque materials such as soils equals zero, the60\nbalance between reflection and absorbance is governed by the influence of soil physical and61\nchemical properties (Mouazen et al., 2005). The Vis-NIR spectroscopy was adopted by many62\nresearch groups to measure soil properties. Although several researchers reported off-line non-63\nmobile measurement of soil properties, only few studies on on-line measurement of soil64\nproperties were reported (Shonk et al., 1991; Sudduth and Hummel, 1993; Shibusawa et al.,65\n2003; Mouazen et al., 2005). This is attributed to difficulties in designing a sensor that can66\npenetrate the soil and acquire spectra successfully (Mouazen et al., 2007). In addition, lower67\naccuracy associated with providing general calibration models valid over a wide geographical68\narea enhances limiting the attraction of researchers to develop a working on-line sensor.69\nHowever, research is required to improve the performance of the few on-line Vis-NIR sensors70\nexist, since on-line data acquisition about soil is useful input for sensor-based variable rate71\napplication of different inputs into agricultural soils (Maleki et al., 2007).72\nBased on laboratory measurement of soil spectra using a Vis-NIR spectrophotometer, we73\nfound the diffusive light reflected from the soil surface decreases with the increasing soil-to-74\nsensor distance (D) and angle between the soil and sensor (\uf061). These two parameters induce75\nundesired changes in spectra, which requires a correction algorithm to retain the original76\nspectral features. Other researchers encountered the same problem during the development of77\non-line measurement systems of soil properties (Sudduth and Hummel, 1993; Shibusawa et al.,78\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n4\n2003). Generally, D affects the accuracy of prediction of soil properties e.g. carbon, nitrogen,79\netc (Sudduth and Hummel, 1993). Mouazen et al. (2005) claimed that they were able to80\nminimise D variation by introducing reasonably similar maps of moisture content developed by81\nan on-line sensor and oven drying method. In fact, the highest light reflection from the soil82\nsurface can be recorded when direct contact between the soil and the sensor (D = 0 mm and \uf061 =83\n0\u00b0) is ensured. During on-line measurement of soil properties the direct contact should be84\nfulfilled, bearing in mind that vibration can always exist during measurement that might disturb85\nthe collection of spectra. However, the vibration induced noise can be eliminated from the86\nspectra by spectra pre-processing such as smoothening, normalisation and\/or multiplicative87\nscatter correction (Mouazen et al., 2005).88\nIn order to keep the sensor in continuous contact with the soil, two conditions have to be89\ntaken into consideration. Firstly, a proper mechanical design of the optical probe (the unit that90\npenetrates the soil and collects soil spectra) has to be provided, which should ensure continuous91\npenetration of the soil, preparation of a smooth soil surface and preservation of direct contact92\nbetween the soil and the optical probe (Mouazen et al., 2005; Mouazen et al., 2007). The other93\ncondition is to ensure a proper calibration of the tractor three-point linkage, in order to attain94\ntransactional and longitudinal levelling of the optical probe. This has to be accompanied with95\nmanual adjustment of the tractor hydraulic system to locate the sensor to the required depth,96\nwhile preserving levelling of the sensor.97\nThe main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to optimise the tractor three-98\npoint linkage system set up, aiming at minimising D and \uf061 and improving the quality of on-line99\ncollected soil spectra. The second aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of correction of100\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n5\non-line measured spectra on the accuracy of prediction of plant available phosphorus in soil (P-101\navl).102\n103\n2. Materials and methods104\n105\n2.1. Portable, fibre-type visible and near infrared spectrophotometer106\n107\nThe spectrophotometer was a fibre-type Vis-NIR instrument developed by Zeiss Company108\n(Zeiss Corona 45 visnir fibre, Germany). It is fast (1 soil scan per 0.4 sec) and of small size, has109\nno moving parts, and has been successfully used on mobile machines e.g. to measure grain110\nquality on combines (Reyns et al., 2001; Maertens et al., 2004), soil moisture content (Mouazen111\net al., 2005) and extractable P, P-avl, total carbon, organic carbon and pH (Mouazen et al.,112\n2007). It was also used to optimise an on-line variable rate applicator of triple super phosphate113\n(P2O5) during maize planting based on on-line measurement of soil extractable phosphorus114\nusing the on-line Vis-NIR sensor of this study, shown in Fig. 1 (Maleki et al., 2006b; Maleki et115\nal., 2007). The instrument has, in addition to the Si-array available for the measurement in the116\nVis and short infrared wavelength region (306.5 \u2013 1135.5 nm), an InGaAs diode-array for the117\nmeasurement in the NIR region (944.5 \u2013 1710.9 nm). The light source is a 20 Watt tungsten118\nhalogen lamp illuminating the targeted soil surface with a spot of 2-3 mm light through an optic119\nfibre. The illumination and reflectance fibres were positioned at a 45\u00b0 angle in an optical probe120\nused to carry out reflectance measurement from the soil surface prepared by the tine (Fig. 2).121\nStandard white (75% reflectance) and black (7% reflectance) references were used.122\n123\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n6\n2.2. On-line visible and near infrared soil sensor124\n125\nThe on-line measurement system consisted of a penetration tine (subsoiler), to which the126\noptical probe is attached (Fig. 1). The tine and optical probe were set on a frame, which was127\nmounted onto the three-point linkage of the tractor. It is a simple frame, which has a metal128\nwheel on each side to regulate the subsoiler depth. However, depth control is only done in the129\ndownwards direction by the two wheels. The upwards movement of the tine due to tractor130\ndriving over a higher spot than that of the sensor driven behind can not be controlled. The depth131\n(draught based) control system linked to the hydraulic system of the tractor had to be set at132\nminimum response to draught variation during the field test to reduce vibration and variation in133\nD and \uf061. The tine penetrates the soil to any required depth between 5 and 40 cm, making a134\ntrench, whose bottom is smoothened due to the downwards force acting on the tine. This135\ndownwards force increases friction between the flat bottom of the tine and its retrofitted probe136\nwith the soil, which improves smoothening of the bottom of the trench and maximises light137\nreflectance.138\n139\n2.3. Laboratory calibration of the measurement system140\n141\nA preliminary test was undertaken under laboratory conditions to set the three-point linkage142\nand the hydraulic system of the tractor in a proper position that would ensure the tine143\npenetration to a depth of 15 cm, while preserving the optical probe in a horizontal position144\n(angle \uf061 and D = 0 in Fig. 2a) parallel to the bottom of the trench opened by the subsoiler. The145\nhorizontal probe levelling included longitudinal and transactional adjustments of the upper third146\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n7\npoint link and lower two-point links, respectively. The experiment showed that the optimal L is147\n555 mm, for which a longitudinal (parallel to the direction of travel) levelling of the optical148\nprobe was achieved. In order to insure this position of the optical probe, the hydraulic system of149\nthe tractor was manually adjusted to a given level. This optimal calibration set up obtained150\nunder laboratory conditions, including the three-point linkage and hydraulic system, was151\nadopted during the on-line field measurement.152\n153\n2.4. Field measurement154\n155\n2.4.1. Evaluation of the effect of different third point link lengths on quality of spectra156\n157\nTo verify the laboratory calibration of the three-point linkage hydraulic system, on-line158\nmeasurement of soil spectra was carried out on a Haplic Luvisol (FAO classification) field in159\nHeverlee, 30 km east of Brussels (Belgium). The field soil texture determined by wet sieving160\nand a hydrometer test was a silt loam (Table 1), according to the United Stated Department of161\nAgriculture (USDA) system of texture classification. The experiment was carried out in the162\nautumn of 2005 after harvesting sugar beet. The field was even, particularly the plot where the163\ntest was carried out. The optical sensor was pulled through 5 parallel lines, 5 m apart along a 15164\nm distance parallel with the direction of the tramlines. Carrying out the measurement within a165\nrelatively small area of the field minimised the effect of variable soil conditions and field166\ntopography, which allowed information about the effect of L on the quality of spectra to be167\nextracted.168\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n8\nThe system was driven at a travel speed of 1.5 \u2013 2.0 km h-1, setting the tine tip at a depth of169\n0.15 m. Each collected spectrum was an average of 5 successive spectra collected along a170\ndistance of 1 \u2013 1.50 m, depending on tractor speed. The averaged gravimetric moisture content171\n(d.b.) for all lines was at the field capacity (Table 2), ranging between 18.7 and 20.1 kg kg-1.172\nFive different L of 545, 550, 555, 560 and 565 mm were adopted. Each length was used for173\nmeasurement of one individual line. After measurement of an individual line, L was changed for174\nthe next measurement line. This variation in L provided different positions of the optical probe175\nas shown in Fig. 2. Since the variation of \uf061 and D are very small (scale of few degrees and176\nmillimetres for \uf061 and D, respectively), it was not possible to measure them precisely during on-177\nline measurement. Therefore, they were calculated theoretically under laboratory conditions and178\nreported in Table 2.179\n180\n2.4.2. Correction of on-line collected soil spectra181\n182\nDue to a technical issue associated with the Vis-NIR spectrophotometer from Zeiss company183\nused in this study, spectral shifts towards the upper or the lower directions were recorded during184\non-line measurement with most of measured spectra at all L (Fig. 3). The shift occurred at 970185\nnm, which might be attributed to vibration and\/or different D and \uf061 between the background186\n(reference) measurement and soil measurement. Furthermore, this spectral shift could also be187\ndue to a differential response between the two detectors used (400-969 nm and 970-1700 nm). A188\nsimple test under non-mobile laboratory conditions confirmed that vibration has no effect on the189\ncreation of this shift. In fact, vibration induced noise in spectra along the entire wavelength190\nrange. Examining the effect of different D and \uf061 between white reference measurement (D=0191\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n9\nmm and \uf061=0\u00b0) and real soil measurement (D>0 mm and \uf061\u22600\u00b0) proved that the presence of shift192\nin spectra is due to variable D and \uf061. The size of this shift depends on the magnitude of D and193\n\uf061.194\nSpectra correction was done by developing a custom built software using the LabView195\nprogramming language. This software was based on the assumption of shifting the lower spectra196\nsegment (at 306 \u2013 968 nm or 972 \u2013 1700 nm) to match the higher part. This was done as197\nfollows:198\n1. The difference in reflectance in % between 968 and 972 nm wavelengths was calculated.199\n2. If the reflectance at wavelength 968 nm was higher than that at 972 nm, the reflectance200\ndifference was added to all wavelengths in the range of 972 \u2013 1700 nm. While, if the201\nreflectance at wavelength 968 nm was lower than that at 972 nm, the reflectance202\ndifference was added to all wavelengths in the range of 306 \u2013 968 nm.203\n204\n2.4.3. Evaluation of the effect of soil-to-sensor distance and angle variations on the prediction205\naccuracy of plant available phosphorus in soil206\n207\nPrevious on-line measurement data from 2004 was recalled to test the effect of spectra208\ncorrection on improving the accuracy of prediction of P-avl, as an example. Availability of209\nchemical and spectral data from the previous year (2004) allowed the correction approach210\nproposed during Heverlee field measurement in 2005 (see section 2.4.2.) to be tested. The211\nmeasurement in Heverlee field in 2005 concerned about mechanical calibration only, where no212\nchemical data were available. The correction approach will be tested by comparing the213\nprediction accuracy of P-avl before and after removing the shift in spectra.214\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n10\nThe experimental field in 2004 was a Haplic Luvisol (FAO classification) grass field of 2 ha215\narea and was situated in Lovenjoel near Leuven, and had silt loam texture according to the216\nUSDA soil classification (Table 1). The field had a slight slope and was free of tram lines. The217\nfield was divided into a 6 by 10 m grid, as shown in Fig. 4. The optical sensor was pulled along218\nthe longest directions of the field through 18 parallel lines each 6 m apart at a forward speed of219\n2-3 km h-1, setting the tip at a 0.15 m depth. A total of 126 soil samples were collected mostly220\nfrom the 6 middle lines (Fig. 4) after sensor passed. Each sample was collected at the bottom of221\nthe trench opened by the tine over a distance of 1 \u2013 1.5 m. The samples were dried and sieved222\nwith a 2 mm sieve, before P-avl was measured using the Olsen method (Olsen et al., 1954). A223\nsufficient amount of wet samples was used to estimate the moisture content by drying in an oven224\nat 105\u00b0 for 24 h. The average field moisture content was at the field capacity. The results of soil225\nmoisture content and P-avl of these samples are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.226\nA digital global positioning system, Trimble\u00ae AgDGPS 132 was used to locate the position of227\nsoil spectra. The 126 on-line collected spectra with a location matching the location of the 126228\nsoil samples collected for laboratory analysis of P-avl were later separated from the data set and229\nused to predict P-avl using the model described in a previous study (Maleki et al., 2006a). This230\nmodel was established using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis with a full cross validation231\ntechnique on 204 independent spectra of fresh soil samples collected from many fields in232\nBelgium having these texture classes of loamy sand, sandy loam and silt loam. Measurement of233\nspectra used for developing P-avl model was done under laboratory non-mobile measurement234\nconditions. The results of the calibration model and the prediction of P-avl of 126 off-line235\nrecorded spectra under laboratory condition of soil samples collected in Lovenjoel field is236\nillustrated in Table 4 (Maleki et al., 2006a). This model was used in this study to predict P-avl237\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n11\nusing spectra collected on-line in Lovenjoel field. Maps of laboratory Olsen measured and on-238\nline predicted P-avl using on-line recorded spectra were developed using geostatistical software239\n(GSLIB). The algorithm used was ordinary kriging (Goovaerts, 1997), which requires the240\ndetermination of a variogram model. The experimental variogram was obtained through:241\n242\n\uf07b \uf07d2\u03b1\u03b1\n)(\n1=\u03b1\n)(-)+(\n)(2\n1\n=)(\u03b3 xhx\nh\nh\nh\nzz\nN\nN\n\uf0e5 (1)243\n244\nwhere )(h\uf067 is the variogram for a distance vector (lag) h between observations z(x\uf061) and z(x\uf061 +245\nh), and N(h) is the number of pairs separated by h. The experimental variogram data were246\nmodelled by considering the indicative goodness of fit provided by Variowin (Pannatier, 1996).247\nIn all cases a spherical model was found to be best:248\n249\nah\na\nh\na\nh\nCCh \uf0a3\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0d7\uf02b <0if\n2\n1\n-\n2\n3\n=)(\u03b3\n3\n10 (2)250\nahCCh >if=)(\u03b3 10 \uf02b (3)251\n252\nwhere C0 is the nugget effect (Y-intercept), C0+C1 is the sill and a is the range.

Evaluation of soil spectra collected on-line at different third point link length260\n261\nFigure 3 shows soil spectra collected on-line for 5 different experimental lines carried out262\nwith 5 different L, reflecting 5 values of angle \uf061 and D (Table 2). A total of 8 spectra for each263\nmeasurement line collected along 15 m travel distance are shown in Fig. 3.264\nWith L equals to 545 mm (line A), the quality of spectra is extremely bad. Apart from 8265\nspectra only one spectrum is a soil spectrum. However, two other spectra are successfully266\nmeasured by the first detector (306 \u2013 945 nm), while no reflection features are captured in the267\nnear infrared region of (946 \u2013 1700 nm). This poor quality of spectra is attributed to the fact that268\nthe sensor focal point falls above the soil surface due to the large D. In this case the incidence of269\nthe path of illuminated light and the path of reflected light does not occur at the bottom of trench270\nsoil. But, in order to have a maximum collection of electromagnetic energy from the soil271\nsurface, the focal point should fall directly on the soil surface, at which D and \uf061 vanish. This272\nmeans that the incidence of the illuminated and reflected light should strictly occur on the soil273\nsurface following the passage of the tine and optical probe coming closely behind. The shift in274\nspectra between the two detectors increases in size with increasing D and \uf061, until no signal is275\ncollected at the NIR range, similar to Fig. 3a. This case can be represented by the position of the276\nmeasurement system illustrated in Fig. 2b, where the tine inclines towards the forward direction277\nforming an angle \uf061 with the horizontal. In this case, D and \uf061 are too large (Table 2), for which278\nonly a very small amount of diffuse reflected light from the trench bottom could be captured by279\nthe probe and reached the detector. Capturing this small amount of light takes place only when280\nthe path of illumination light partially met with the path of the reflected light on the soil of the281\nbottom of the trench.282\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n13\nTo evaluate the successful capturing of the reflected light, the maximum reflectance (in283\npercentage) measured for each spectrum was considered. The average maximum reflectance284\n(AMR) of all 8 spectra is adopted and reported in Table 5. Indeed, a very small value of AMR285\nof 7.8% is found during the measurement through line A. This also proves that a very small286\npercentage of reflected light from the soil surface could be captured.287\nIncreasing L to 550 mm (line B) decreases D and \uf061 (Table 2), and subsequently the quality288\nof collected soil spectra improved (Fig. 3b). This is reflected by the number of successfully289\ncollected soil spectra and by the AMR (Table 5). However, the values of these two indicators290\nare still too small to declare a well-levelled position of the optical probe on the bottom of the291\nopened trench. This means that \uf061 and D during line B measurement are still relatively big292\n(Table 2), and the probe position is still similar to the case illustrated in Fig. 2b.293\nThe best soil spectra are collected with L of 555 mm (Line C in Fig. 3c). This observation is294\njustified by the fact that AMR obtained for line C is the highest among the 5 experimental295\nsetups (Table 5). This case can be illustrated by Fig. 2a, where the tine is at the optimal position296\nallowing the bottom of the optical probe to be in continuous contact with the trench bottom297\nopened by the penetration tine (\u03b1 and D = 0). This position should result in a smoother soil298\nsurface at the bottom of the opened trench, and thus maximum light is reflected. The maximum299\nreflection is attributed to the incidence of the illumination light and reflected light on the soil300\nsurface prepared by the system (Fig. 2a). The maximum value of AMR obtained here indicates301\nthat the signal-to-noise ratio is high, and is higher than the other 5 experimental lines. The302\npercentage of successfully measured spectra is 100%, and all measured spectra can be used for303\npredictions of soil chemical and physical properties.304\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n14\nWith further increase in L to 560 (line D) and 565 mm (Line E), the quality of soil spectra305\nacquired degrades. In this case the incidence of the illuminated light and reflected light falls306\nbelow the reflection surface of the soil (Fig. 2c) leading to light collection from only the edge of307\nthe illuminated soil spot. This is reflected by the decrease in AMR values for both lines (Table308\n5). However, the number of successfully collected spectra does not change (100% successful309\nspectra). The decrease in the AMR for these two lines would mean a decrease of the signal-to-310\nnoise ratio, and eventually the prediction accuracy of soil properties might be influenced.311\nComparing the spectra collected for each measurement line, it can be concluded that the best312\nquality of spectra is obtained with 555 mm L (zero values of D and \uf061), as illustrated in Fig. 3.313\n314\n3.2. Correction of on-line measured spectra315\n316\nAlthough L of 555 mm was found to be the optimal length, at which D and \uf061 theoretically317\nvanish, shift still occurs at a wavelength of 970 nm for most measured spectra, which318\nemphasises the need for spectra correction at any selected L. The disturbed and hollowed soil319\nstructure that resulted after sugar beet extraction in Heverlee field could introduce significant320\nvariation in D and \uf061, which would explain this shift (Fig. 3). However, in grass or after harvest321\nof cereal crops, the authors found less occurrence of this shift in spectra. In fact, variation in D322\nand \uf061 can only be minimised, but not be avoided. The correction of soil spectra adopted in this323\nstudy to eliminate this shift results in smooth spectra without a shift up or down. Figure 5 shows324\ncorrected spectra of those measured at L of 555 mm (Fig. 3c). These spectra had to be subjected325\nto further pre-processing (normalisation, derivation, smoothing, etc) before it can be used for the326\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n15\nfinal prediction of soil properties. The type of spectra pre-processing depends on the type of327\nelement to be quantified (Mouazen et al., 2006).328\nIn order to evaluate the usefulness of the correction made on spectra to remove the shift that329\noccurred at 969 \u2013 970 nm wavelength, the on-line measured spectra (126 spectra) in Lovenjoel330\nfield were used to predict P-avl using spectra with and without shift (corrected spectra). The331\npredicted P-avl values of 126 spectra were compared with the corresponding laboratory332\nreference measurement of soil samples collected from the same locations. There is a difference333\nin the prediction accuracy of P-avl values between on-line measured soil spectra collected from334\nfield without spectra correction (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.15 mg 100g-1 and ratio of335\nprediction deviations (RPD) = 1.39) compared to those predicted with corrected spectra (RMSE336\n= 1.07 mg 100g-1 and RPD = 1.42). This difference indicates only small improvement in the337\nprediction accuracy obtained after correction of spectra, as shown in Table 6. These point-by-338\npoint statistics however do not take the spatial structure of the data into account. Therefore,339\nstandardised variograms were calculated and modelled by a spherical model of the 126340\nlaboratory measurements, the uncorrected and the corrected P-avl values (Fig. 6). It can clearly341\nbe observed that the variogram of the corrected P-avl approaches more the variogram of the342\nlaboratory values compared to the uncorrected values, with both the nugget effect and the range343\ncloser to the values of the variogram of the laboratory data. This indicates that the spatial344\nstructure of P-avl is better captured by the corrected predictions compared to the uncorrected.345\nThe improvement of using corrected spectra to predict P-avl can also be shown as a map346\nbasis. By visually comparing Figs. 7a, 7b and 7c, similarities in the spatial patterns of P-avl are347\nobvious. Similarity between categorical maps is usually quantified through a statistical kappa348\n(\u03ba) value (Cohen, 1960), expressing proportionally how much better the results are compared to349\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n16\na purely random classification. The larger \u03ba, the more accurate the classification. To obtain350\ncategorical maps of P-avl, all maps were classified into five classes based on the 0.2, 0.4, 0.6351\nand 0.8 quantiles of the interpolated laboratory measurements. The resulting maps are shown in352\nFig. 8a, 8b and 8c. The \u03ba value of comparing the laboratory classification with the uncorrected353\nP-avl is 0.428, whereas for the comparison with the corrected P-avl classification \u03ba is 0.555.354\nAccording to Landis and Koch (1977), the strength of agreement between the laboratory355\nclassification and both the classification of the corrected and the uncorrected P-avl was356\nconsidered to be moderate. Nevertheless, the improvement of using corrected spectra for P-avl357\nprediction results in an increase in map similarity of 29.6% (based on the \u03ba values).358\nThe accuracy of P-avl map developed in this study is much improved compared to that359\nintroduced by Mouazen et al. (2007). This improvement can be attributed to the more accurate360\nmodel used in this study (Maleki et al., 2006a) compared to that used by Mouazen et al. (2007).361\nThe model of Maleki et al. (2006a) was built for only three soil textures, namely, loamy sand,362\nsandy loam and silt loam, whereas the model of Mouazen et al. (2007) was built for all texture363\nclasses encountered in Flanders, the Northern part of Belgium. Furthermore, the model of364\nMaleki et al. (2006a) used more samples (204) for a smaller number of texture classes (3) as365\ncompared to the smaller number of samples (175 samples) for a larger number of texture classes366\nused for the model of Mouazen et al. (2007). This makes the model developed by Maleki et al.367\n(2006a) more accurate than that developed by Mouazen et al. (2007) for prediction of P-avl for368\nthese three texture classes. Since the texture of the Lovenjoel field (silt loam) is one of the three369\ntextures valid for Maleki et al., (2006a) model, it is logical that more accurate prediction has to370\nbe achieved using this model (compared to the that of Mouazen et al. (2007).371\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n17\nComparing results given in Table 4 with those of Table 6, one can conclude that the372\naccuracy of on-line measurement of P-avl (a smaller R2 of 0.62, almost equal RMSE of 1.07 and373\na smaller RPD of 1.42) is rather less than the off-line, non-mobile measurement (a larger R2 of374\n0.68, almost equal RMSE of 1.08 and a higher RPD of 1.76). The reason of such degradation in375\nthe accuracy of P-avl prediction during on-line measurement is the deviation between the376\nstarting point of a spectrum measurement as compared to that of corresponding soil sample377\ncollected for laboratory chemical analysis. With the most accurate digital global positioning378\nsystem, a deviation in position of 0.5-1 m is expected. This deviation might introduce a source379\nof error, since the variability in soil is even smaller than this tolerance (1-0.5 m). Another reason380\nthat might introduce a source of error is the larger surface (1.25 m) scanned by the381\nspectrophotometer compared to the amount of soil considered for the chemical analysis.382\n383\n4. Conclusions384\n385\nAn approach to calibrate the tractor hydraulic system for successful on-line measurement of386\nsoil spectra using visible and near infrared spectroscopy was introduced and tested. The387\ncalibration included the determination of the optimal length of the tractor third point link (L)388\nand the manual adjustment of the hydraulic system to position the sensor at a specified depth,389\nwhile preserving a horizontal levelling of the sensor for maximum light reflection detection390\nfrom the bottom of the opened trench.391\nFor successful on-line measurement, the soil-to-sensor distance (D) and angle (\u03b1) should be392\nminimised so that maximum electromagnetic energy reflected from the soil surface can be393\ncollected. This also requires a successful mechanical design of the on-line sensor that ensures394\nSoil and Tillage Research, Volume 103, Issue 1, April 2009, Pages 144-152\n18\ncontinuous penetration into the soil, when it is set to the required depth after the proper395\ncalibration of the tractor three-point linkage and hydraulic system is achieved. However, each396\nmeasurement depth requires a different calibration, which has to be carried out separately.397\nModifying and correction of soil spectra is essential to improve the accuracy of on-line398\nmeasured soil properties. This becomes a critical step when on-line measurement is to be carried399\nout after root crops harvest (sugar beet or potato), since the soil layer penetrated by the sensor is400\ndisturbed or even contains hollowed space. Therefore, the effect of correction of spectra would401\nhave been greater if the crop had been a root crop instead of grass, since smaller variation in D402\nand \u03b1 is experienced after grain crop harvest.403\n404\nAcknowledgements405\n406\nThe authors acknowledge the IWT-Flanders (project nr: IWT\/20711) for the financial407\nsupport.408\n409\nReferences410\n411\nBen-Dor, E., Banin, A., 1995.
