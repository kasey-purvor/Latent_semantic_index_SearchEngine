INTRODUCTION \ntroke is one of the most common causes of death and the \nleading cause of severe disabilities in the UK [1, 2]. It \noccurs when an artery to the brain bursts or becomes \nblocked, thereby stopping or interrupting the blood supply to \nthe brain [1]. This usually results in an infarct in the brain, which \ncomprises dead tissues due to the stroke. The detailed \ninformation about the location and volume of the infarcts is \n \nManuscript received March 28, 2007.  \nS. Shen is with the Department of Psychology, University of Surrey, \nGuildford, UK (phone: 44-1483-682881; e-mail: shan.shen@surrey.ac.uk). \nAndr\u00e9 J.

In \naddition, the availability of a lesion mask may also be beneficial \nto analyses of functional MRI [10] and diffusion tensor imaging. \nTherefore, an effective lesion detection method is highly \ndesirable. \nWith the fast advancement of MRI, which provides high \nresolution images, detection of infarct lesion is becoming \nincreasingly more feasible [11]. However, due to their arbitrary \nshapes and locations, segmentation of lesions is a complex and \nchallenging task. Manual delineation is thus widely employed \nfor this purpose [12, 13], but it is very time-consuming, which \nmay be an unrealistic approach when a large amount of data \nneeds to be processed. Another disadvantage of manual lesion \ndelineation is that the results are highly dependent on the \nexpertise of operators. In this case, continuous efforts have been \nmade on automatic detection of different types of lesions in the \nliterature. Although a great number of segmentation methods \nare available, such as thresholding [14], region growing [15] \nand clustering [16-21], they are problematic when applied to \nlesion detection. This is because lesions often possess similar \nintensities to some normal tissues. For example, in T1-weighted \nMR images, an infarct lesion is shown with intensities similar to \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or grey matter (GM), so that a \nstandard segmentation approach would group them together \nrather than separately. In order to solve this problem, \nmulti-spectral MR images were employed for the purpose of \nlesion detection by many researchers. For example, Anbeek et al. \n[22-24] presented a segmentation method for white matter (WM) \nlesions using five different MRI modalities including \nT1-weighted, inversion recovery (IR), proton density-weighted \n(PD), T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery \n(FLAIR). It is based on a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) \nclassification technique, which builds a feature space from \nvoxel intensity and spatial information. Sajja et al. [25] used \nPD-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR MR images to segment \nMS lesions, which involved techniques such as Parzen window \nclassifier, morphological operations, hidden Markov random \nfield-expectation maximization (HMRF-EM) algorithm and \nfuzzy connectivity. A similar approach was employed by Datta \net al. [26] to identify black holes in MS. Leemput et al. [27] \nproposed an intensity-based tissue classification algorithm \nimplemented with T1-, T2- and PD-weighted scans using a \nDetection of Infarct Lesions from Single MRI \nModality Using Inconsistency between Voxel \nIntensity and Spatial Location \uf8e7 A 3D Automatic \nApproach \nShan Shen, Andr\u00e9 J.

Many other lesion segmentation studies based on \nmulti-spectral anatomical MRI scans were reported in [28-34]. \nHowever, in the majority of clinical situations only one type \nof anatomical MR image is collected, since the acquisition of \nmulti-spectral anatomical images is more time and cost \nintensive. Longer scanning times are further not feasible in \nmany patients due to the severity of their condition. There is a \nlarge number of existing patient data with just one anatomical \nMRI. Extracting lesion information from these data is only \nrealistic if automatic segmentation algorithms are not confined \nto multi-spectral images. Therefore, the development of a robust \nautomatic lesion detection approach, which is capable of \ndetecting lesions from a single anatomical MRI scan, is essential. \nA few attempts have been made to detect brain abnormality \nusing T1-weighted MR images only. Cuadra et al. [35] used a \npriori model of lesion growth to segment large brain tumors. \nHowever, it is a semi-automatic approach where a seed voxel of \ntumors has to be chosen manually. The selection thus requires \nanatomical and biological knowledge of tumor growth. \nStamatakis and Tyler [36] presented a statistical method to \nidentify brain lesions. They compared individual patient images \nto a normal control group based on the general linear model and \nthe detected significant structure differences between the patient \nand the controls were regarded as lesions. Srivastava et al. [37] \nemployed a similar statistical approach to detect focal cortical \ndysplastic (FCD) lesions from a lesion specific feature map \nconstructed by computing the ratio of cortical thickness over \nabsolute image intensity gradient. However, the disadvantage of \nthese statistical segmentation methods is that the selection of a \ncontrol group (e.g. group size) may have an impact on \nsegmentation results [38]. Another potential limitation of this \ntype of methods is that patient data and control images should be \nscanned using the same scanner, coils and identical parameters, \notherwise additional bias may be introduced. This issue hence \nrestricts the general application of this type of methods to lesion \nidentification.  \nAs stated above, using the traditional segmentation method \nalone is insufficient to identify lesions from normal tissues \nowing to their intensity similarity. Among the studies using \nmulti-spectral MR images, Wei et al. [39] demonstrated that the \naddition of a template-driven approach to \nexpectation-maximization algorithm (EM), significantly \nimproved the segmentation accuracy of WM abnormalities. \nKamber et al. [40] generated a 3-D tissue probability model \nusing healthy controls and demonstrated that with the assistance \nof the model, four segmentation methods tested reduced false \npositive detection of lesions by 50-80%. These studies \ndemonstrated that the usage of spatial information would \nimprove the capability of traditional segmentation methods in \nlesion identification. It thus brings an idea that a proper \ncombination of a traditional segmentation method and some \nspatial information of brain tissues may allow detecting lesions \nfrom a single anatomical MR image effectively. \nTherefore, the main objective of this paper is to present a \nfully automatic 3D segmentation approach to detect infarct \nlesions from a single anatomical MRI scan. It is implemented by \ncalculating the likelihood of an inconsistency between \nsegmentation results derived from voxel intensities and tissue \npartitions based on spatial location. More specifically, with a \nprior knowledge of normal tissue distribution in the brain, the \nprobability of each voxel belonging to each tissue type is known \nin an MR image. If the same image is segmented based on voxel \nintensity, those voxels, where lesions are present, are more \nlikely to be assigned to a different tissue class rather than the \none suggested by the tissue distribution. Therefore, the degree \nof the inconsistency between them is calculated, which may \nindicate the likelihood of those voxels being lesions. In this \npaper, the conventional FCM algorithm is employed for \nintensity based segmentation. The spatial location based tissue \ndistribution is provided by prior tissue probability maps.  \nIn Section II, materials and the basic theory of FCM is \nintroduced, as well as how the FCM algorithm cooperates with \nthe tissue probability maps to detect lesions. In Section III, in \norder to validate the performance of our method quantitatively, \nsimulated lesions controlled for variables such as lesion sizes \nand lesion signal reduction are presented, along with the \ndefinitions of performance evaluation parameters. \nSegmentation results on both simulated and real lesions are \ndescribed in Section IV, in which the proposed method is also \ncompared with the statistical lesion detection approach. Section \nV discusses issues relating to detection accuracy of the \nproposed method. Conclusion is addressed in Section VI. \nII. MATERIAL AND METHODS \nA. Image Acquisition \n15 stroke patients\n1\n (female=5, mean age= 54.27 and \nstd=10.96, >12 months after stroke, seizure free and had no \nhistory of mental health problems) and 26 healthy subjects \n(male=6, mean age = 22.77 and std = 4.47) have been scanned \nin this study. All MR images were acquired on a 3T Siemens \nTrio scanner (Erlangen, Germany). High-resolution 3D brain \nMRI images were obtained using a T1-weighted magnetization \nprepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse \nsequence, with the following characteristics: TR=1830ms, \nTE=4.43ms, Inversion Time=1100ms, 1 acquisition, flip \nangle=11\u00b0, FOV=256mm, 176 slices, voxel size=1\u00d71\u00d71mm3, \nin-plane matrix=256\u00d7256. Prior to scanning, all participants \ngave written informed consent according to the guidelines of the \nUniversity of Surrey ethical review board. Participants were \npaid for participation. \nB. Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) Clustering Algorithm  \nThe FCM clustering algorithm was introduced by Bezdek \n[41], which is one of the most popular segmentation methods in \nthe literature [16, 18, 19]. When FCM is applied to \nsegmentation of grey-scale images, such as MRI, it classifies \nvoxels in an image into a pre-specified number of clusters based \non voxel intensities. It employs a fuzzy membership U to \ndescribe the degree of likeness of one voxel to each cluster. The \nmembership is determined by intensity differences between the \n \n1 The stroke patients in this study who have either left or right hand motor \ndeficits were recruited for a two-week recovery therapy \nThis article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited.

The detailed \ndescription of FCM can be found in [19]. As only one type of \nMR images is input for segmentation in this paper, the fuzzy \nmembership U is a NC\u00d7  data matrix. \nC. Segmentation of Lesion Cluster \nTissue probability maps are maps which describe the \nprobability of each voxel belonging to specific classes of tissues \nin a standard space. They are usually created by images \nobtained from a large group of healthy participants, thus \nrepresenting an averaged topology of tissues in the brain. The \ntissue probability maps used in this paper are modified versions \nof ICBM (International Consortium for brain mapping: \nhttp:\/\/www.loni.ucla.edu\/ICBM\/), which are the default maps \nprovided in SPM5 (Statistical Parametric Mapping: \nhttp:\/\/www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk\/spm\/). The original data was \nderived from 452 T1-weighted MR images, and then affine \nregistered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space \nand down sampled to 2mm resolution. \nLet T be tissue probability maps, where T is a NC \u00d7  data \nmatrix. C represents the number of probability maps, which is \nidentical to the cluster number in FCM. Tij \u2286t , refers to the \nprobability of the i-th voxel belongs to the j-th cluster. \nThe FCM algorithm segments each voxel into a pre-specified \nnumber of tissues based on its intensity, while the tissue \nprobability maps classify each voxel into these clusters of \ntissues according to the location of the voxel. Given an image \nfrom a healthy participant, the intensity based and the location \nbased segmentation should be similar. However, if there are \nlesions present, the above two are more likely unmatched. \nTherefore, lesions may be detected by their extent of \ninconsistency. The higher the inconsistency at each voxel, the \nmore likely it being a lesion. \nL={l1,l2,\u2026lj \u2026lN}, describes a measurement of inconsistency \nbetween the fuzzy membership and the probability \nmaps. ]1,0[\u2208j l .

If the \nmembership classifies the j-th voxel to the k-th cluster, the \nprobability maps indicate that this voxel only has less than 10% \n( 1.0<kjt ) probability to be the same cluster, the inconsistency \nis defined as the maximum )1( =j l . In other cases, the \nmeasurement of inconsistency is derived from an average \ndisagreement between the fuzzy membership and the \nprobability, i.e. the difference between the maximum \nmembership and the corresponding probability, plus the \ndifference between the maximum probability and the \ncorresponding membership. Weighting parameters,\u03b1 and \u03b2, are \nused to adjust the proportion of these two differences in the \naverage. Finally, if the inconsistency at any voxel is higher than \nthe mean of its maximum membership and probability, this \nvoxel is then regarded as lesions. \nD. Segmentation Procedure \nFour probability maps are utilized in this approach (i.e. C = 4), \nincluding background, CSF, GM and WM, in which the \nbackground map is the inversed image of a brain mask, provided \nin SPM5 while the latter three maps are adapted versions of \nICBM atlas. \nFig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the whole segmentation \nprocedure. As stated above, the probability maps are in the MNI \nspace. In order to match the individual brain to the maps, an \ninitial registration step is required to normalize original images \nto the MNI space. The normalization method employed is a \nunified segmentation approach embedded in SPM5, which \nenables image registration, tissue classification, and bias \ncorrection to be combined within the same generative model \n[21]. This approach can segment the healthy brains but provides \nno option of lesion detection. Likewise, the traditional \nnormalization approach in SPM5 can also be used for this \npurpose. Depending on the voxel size of normalized MR images, \nthe tissue probability maps are sampled to the identical \nresolution (in this paper: 1x1x1mm) using the Trilinear \ninterpolation algorithm. A smoothing kernel of FWHM=10mm \nis applied to the sampled maps so as to cover more varieties of \nthe brain, such as different brain sizes and bigger\/smaller \nventricles.  \nThis article has been accepted for publication in a future issue of this journal, but has not been fully edited. Content may change prior to final publication.\nTITB-00076-2007.R2 \n \nCopyright (c) 2007 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted \n4 \nThe brain mask mentioned above is applied to normalized \nMR images for the removal of non-brain regions, such as skull. \nThen, the brain only images are segmented using the FCM \nalgorithm into background, CSF, GM and WM. The fuzzy \nmemberships for each cluster are smoothed with a Gaussian \nkernel of 4mm to increase connectivity among neighboring \nvoxels.  \nNext, the inconsistency between the fuzzy membership and \nthe sampled and smoothed prior probability maps are calculated \nbased on (2). The lesions are then identified by (3).   \nSmall clusters are always present in detected lesions. They \nare more likely noise or artefacts rather than true lesions. \nTherefore, clusters with voxel numbers less than 1000 (i.e. \nvolume of 1cm\n3\n) are removed by morphological labelling. \nFurthermore, false positive segmentation happens often on \nedges of the brain because of residual variances to the \nprobability maps after normalization. Hence, the detection of \nlesions excludes regions around edges of the brain using the \nbrain mask. Finally, lesions are inversely normalized from the \nMNI space back to the original brain space. \nIII. VALIDATION \nA. Simulated lesion  \nIn order to validate the proposed lesion detection method \nquantitatively, simulated lesions were introduced into images \nfrom healthy participants. Therefore, exact sizes and locations \nof lesions were known, which could be regarded as the ground \ntruth of lesions. Instead of using sphere or cube, irregular shapes \nof simulated lesions, which are more representative to real \nlesions, were generated using a 3D region of interests (ROI) \ncreation tool provided in MRIcro \n(http:\/\/www.sph.sc.edu\/comd\/rorden\/mricro.html). Initially, \norigins of ROIs were chosen manually, along with varied radius \nand intensity differences at both origin and edge. The created \n3D ROIs were saved as binary masks and then overlaid on \nimages of healthy participants individually. The intensities \nwithin the ROIs were reduced by a uniform percentage of \noriginal intensities in the overlaid images. According to \nanalyses on real lesions, it was reported that lesioned areas in \nT1-weighted images comprise of 30 to 90% signal reduction \nwhen compared to healthy tissues [36]. Therefore, to cover the \nvariety of lesions, each simulated lesion in this paper was \nconstructed to include an intensity reduction of 20%, 40%, 60% \nand 80%, respectively. 19 ROIs in different sizes \n(1.147-153.743 cm\n3\n, mean=54.34 cm\n3\n) and locations, were \ngenerated. Hence, the totals of 19x4 images with simulated \nlesions were created for validation purpose. \nB. Performance Evaluation Parameters  \nTo evaluate the performance of the lesion detection method, \nthree popular accuracy measurements were used, introduced by \nthe following equation [24]: \nref\nsegref\nA\nAA\nySensitivit\n\u2229\n=  \nref\nsegref\nAI\nAIAI\nySpecificit\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2229\u2212\n=\n)()(  \nsegref\nsegref\nAA\nAA\nIndexSimilarity\n\u222a\n\u2229\n\u00d7= 2  \nWhere Aref represents the ground truth, which is regions with \ntrue lesions (i.e. simulated lesions in this paper). Aseg represents \ndetected lesions by the proposed method. I refers to the whole \nimage for segmentation.  \nSensitivity measures a true positive detection rate, and \nspecificity measures a true negative detection rate. Similarity \nIndex (SI) is derived from a reliability measure known as the \nkappa statistic, which is sensitive to both size and location of \nsegmentation [23, 24, 31, 42, 43]. \nIV. RESULTS \nIn this section, experimental results are described to validate \nthe performance of the proposed method. Both simulated and \nreal lesions were employed. With the simulated lesions, the \ndetection accuracy was measured using the evaluation \nparameters defined above. The real infarct lesions from stroke \npatients were also used to demonstrate the capability of the \nproposed method in practice. The results of a comparison \nbetween our method and a statistical approach presented in [36] \nwere described.  \nUnless otherwise stated, a value of 2 was employed for the \nweighting exponent m in FCM, since it yielded the best results \nin most images and generally used in the application of FCM. \nAdditionally, \u03b1=1.5 and \u03b2=1 were used in (2). The whole lesion \ndetection approach was implemented in MATLAB. It took \napproximately 4 minutes to process an image on a Window XP \ncomputer with 2.80GHz CPU and 3.5 GB of RAM. \nA. Simulated lesion \nWhen images with simulated lesions were segmented, the \nresults suggested that the lesions were generally well detected. \nFig. 2 illustrates four examples of the detected results at the \nsimulated lesions with 60% of intensity reduction. Fig. 3 shows \na bar chart of the average sensitivity, specificity and SI at \ndifferent intensity reduction rates. It demonstrated that the \nhighest accuracy was achieved at the lesions with 60% intensity \nreduction (Sensitivity=0.900, Specificity=0.999, SI=0.879), \nwhile with the 20% reduction, the accuracy is the lowest \n(Sensitivity=0.385, Specificity=0.999, SI=0.511).  \nFig. 4 shows the sensitivity and SI with regards to the lesion \nvolume.

In contrast, with a lower intensity reduction, \nsegmentation accuracies varied but with no relation to lesion \nvolume. As the specificity was greater than 0.99 in all cases, it is \ntherefore not shown in the figure with regards to lesion volume. \nB. Real Lesion \nThe performance of the proposed method was also \ndemonstrated on real lesioned images. Fig. 5 shows images \nfrom four different patients. The top row of images in each \npanel shows original T1-weighted patient images while the \nbottom row shows detected lesions superimposed on the same \nMRI scans.  \nIn the 15 images tested, the detected infarct lesions in both \nGM and WM were in broad agreement with the real lesions \nbased on visual inspection. The enlargement of ventricle was \nalso identified. In some cases, false positive detection occurred \naround the ventricle, such as Patient 3, Fig.5(c), where the \nanterior part of left ventricle was labelled as lesion. Furthermore, \nlesions on cortical regions were sometimes undetected such as \nin Patient 4 (left hemisphere). \nC. Comparison between the proposed method and the \nstatistical lesion detection method \nThe statistical lesion detection method described in [36, 37] \nwas tested to compare with the proposed method. The control \ngroup included 26 healthy participants. Individual stroke \npatients were compared to the whole control group, after the \nnormalization of all images to the MNI space and smoothing by \na Gaussian kernel of FWHM=8mm. Brain volume, age and \ngender were included in the design matrix to exclude \nconfounding effects. Significant structure differences (i.e. \nlesions) between each patient and the control group were \ndetected using a threshold of p<0.001 (uncorrected). The \nparameters employed, such as the smoothing kernel and the \nthreshold, were suggested to be optimal for lesion detection in \nterms of [36].  \nOverall, the statistical method acquired smoother regions of \nlesions, but its performance was not always consistent. Fig. 6 \nshows three examples of results in the normalized (MNI) space \nobtained from both the statistical and the proposed methods. Fig. \n6(a) illustrates the detections on Patient 5, where lesions \ndetected by the statistical method included false positive \ndetection while the proposed segmentation method identified \nlesions more properly. Fig. 6(b) demonstrates that the statistical \nmethod was unable to identify lesions in Patient 6. \nV. DISCUSSION \nThis paper presents a new lesion detection approach which \nonly requires one type of anatomical MR image. The \nperformance of the proposed method was tested on both \nsimulated and real lesions. The use of simulated lesions \nprovided the ground truth of lesion information, such as lesion \nsize and location, which allowed us to validate the detection \nperformance quantitatively. Different signal reduction \npercentages were introduced in lesioned areas. The results \nshowed that simulated lesions with 20% signal reduction were \ndetected with the lowest accuracy, whilst lesions with 60% \nlesions were detected with most precision. According to \nprevious research by [36], in real lesions, the intensity near the \nlesion border, which consists of a mixture of the normal tissue \nand the lesion, is reduced less (30%-40%) than the centre of the \nlesion. As it is generally accepted that a SI greater than 0.7 \nindicates excellent agreement between detected lesions and true \nlesions [31, 42, 44], it suggested that lesions with 40%-80% \nintensity reduction were all well detected by the proposed \nmethod. This implied that our method was capable of \nidentifying the major part of real lesions, with comparable \naccuracy to existing lesion detection methods using \nmulti-spectral MRI scans [22-24, 43]. However, parts of lesion \nborders might be undetected if only minor lesions were included. \nFig.2 Detected lesion on four simulated images.

Personal use of this material is permitted \n6 \nIn addition, it is worth noticing that the specificity acquired in \nour method is always higher than 0.99, because non-lesioned \nregions are much bigger than the region of lesions in each \nimage. \nWhen spherical simulated lesions were employed, the current \nmethod obtained an average of 0.96 for sensitivity and 0.99 for \nspecificity, along with 0.97 for SI, which were better than the \nresults of Stamatakis and Tyler [36] (The highest true positive \nrate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity) achieved \nwere greater than 0.9).  \nReal infarct lesions from stroke patients were detected using \nboth the proposed method and the statistical approach presented \nin [36]. The results showed that the lesions were generally well \ndetected by our method. The compared statistical approach \nidentified lesions successfully in some images, but failed in \nothers (as shown in Fig. 6). As stated in the literature [38], the \nselection of a control group (e.g. group size) may have an \nimpact on segmentation results, while many covariates such as \nbrain volume, age and gender may also influence structure \ndifferences between a patient and a control group, thus altering \ndetection accuracy for lesions. All those factors are possible \ncontributors to the inconsistent performance seen with the \nstatistical lesion detection approach. It may be the case that if a \nhigher number of healthy participants are included, the \nreliability of the statistical detection approach will be improved. \nHowever, further testing is required to comment on this issue. \nFurthermore, in terms of the basic theory of the proposed \nmethod in this paper, the detection errors mainly occur due to a \nlocation mismatch between the fuzzy memberships and the \ntissue probability maps. Adjusting the settings and parameters \ninvolved may improve its detection performance. This includes \nreducing the false positive and false negative detection rates. \nMore detailed discussion on these issues now follows:  \n1) False positive detection \nFalse positive detection may occur under the following \ncircumstances: Firstly, when the maximum inconsistency is \nassigned, there is still a small possibility (although less than \n10%, 1.0<kjt  in (2)) that the tissue probability indicates a \nsegmentation identical to the membership. In order to lower the \nfalse positive rate due to the above reason, the percentage may \nbe reduced.  \nSecondly, false positive detection may also be found around \nthe ventricle because of its varied shape and size across \nparticipants. Increasing the smoothing kernel size used for \ntissue probability maps loosens constraints on spatial location, \nthus may reduce false positive detection in this region. \nFurthermore, an enlargement of ventricles was identified as \nlesions in the current approach, but it might be considered as \nfalse positive in some applications. To prevent ventricle \ndetection, a CSF template could be applied. \n2) False negative detection \nAs stated in the results, lesions in cortical regions may be \npartly undetected. In fact, cortical lesions were identified in \nmost cases, but then were eliminated from the final detection by \nthe brain mask in the cleaning step. However, without applying \nthe mask, a great deal of false positive detections may be \nincluded in the results. This is due to residual errors of \nnormalization between the normalized brain and the tissue \nprobability maps. To solve this problem, either the mask could \nnot to be applied or the threshold of masking could be reduced. \nIn addition, small clusters with less than 1000 voxels (1cm\n3\n in \n3D volume) were removed from the final detection by the \ncleaning step. Although a cluster smaller than this size is likely \nto be noise, especially for an infarct lesion, true lesions may still \nbe removed. Hence, where there are small lesions, the threshold \nof 1000 voxels could be lowered. \nMoreover, an increase of weighting parameters in (2) may \nenhance the sensitivity (reduce the false negative) of detection \nbut lower the specificity, and vice versa. This is clear from the \nequation that higher \u03b1 and \u03b2 lead to a greater inconsistency and \nraise the likelihood of a brain region being detected as lesions.  \nMost importantly, it is worth noticing that there is always a \ncompromise between false positive and false negative detection. \nReducing one often means increasing the other. Therefore, the \nsettings of parameters may be adjusted in order to find the best \nbalance according to specific characteristics of lesions studied.  \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \nAn automated lesion detection method based on identifying \ninconsistent classification using voxel intensity and spatial \nlocation of tissues in MR images has been proposed in this \npaper. It requires only a single type of anatomical MR image, \nwhich is the most prominent advantage over other lesion \ndetection methods.  \nThe performance validation using simulated lesions \nsuggested that the proposed method achieved detection \naccuracies highly comparable to other studies in which \nmulti-spectral MR images were used. The identification of real \ninfarct lesions from stroke patients further demonstrated the \ncapability of the proposed method in lesion detection.

The results \nwhen compared to those of the current method revealed that the \ncurrent method is more reliable.  \nThe disadvantages of the presented method include that small \nlesions (<1cm\n3 \n) are undetected due to the cleaning step after \nlesion detection. Additionally, the enlarged ventricle is always \ndetected as a lesion which may be considered as false positive. \nFinally, parts of detected lesions around cortical regions may be \nremoved by the application of the brain mask. Therefore, a bit of \ncare is required when choosing the settings of the parameters.  \nAccording to characteristics of the proposed method, it may \nbe capable of detecting lesions caused by brain injury, dementia \nor tumor. Other MRI modalities, not restricted to T1-weighted \nimages, may also be employed for the purpose of lesion \ndetection. Finally, future work will focus on improving the \ncurrent approach for a more general application, such as \ndetecting small lesions, e.g. MS lesions. \n(a) \nFig.6 Result comparisons between the statistical method and the proposed lesion detection method.
