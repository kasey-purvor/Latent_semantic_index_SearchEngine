A \nshort literature review is provided.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) is a large higher education \ninstitution with five campuses in the Manchester city centre and two at some \ndistance away in Cheshire.  In academic year 2003- 2004, the number of full-time \nequivalent students was just over 28,000 and the number of teaching staff was \n1,050.  Approximately 66% of the students were studying at first degree level. \nAlthough the management of the library service is centralised, there is a site library \nand a team of library staff at each campus, managed by a Library Services \nManager.  \n1Following recommendations from academic staff, MMU purchased EndNote through \na national consortial deal in mid-2001.  To promote the availability of the software \nbut with no plans of providing training, the Library\u2019s Research Support Librarian \nlaunched a series of presentations to academic staff.  The response was \nenthusiastic as the academics immediately recognised that EndNote offered an \neffective and simple means of managing their references, and would allow them to \ndedicate their time to researching and writing rather than sorting out complex \nbibliographic formats and arcane punctuation.  Even though they acknowledged \nthat EndNote was relatively straightforward to use, they felt that in order to learn to \nuse the software proficiently and quickly, formal training was required.  They \nconfessed that, without the commitment that attending a course required, they \nwould never find the time to learn to use EndNote on their own.  \nSeeing this as an opportunity to meet the needs of a key group of its users, the \nLibrary responded by developing an EndNote training programme, which is now in \nits third year of operation.  MMU\u2019s experience has been very positive and shows \nthat the provision of such training not only supports the academic work of the \nUniversity\u2019s staff and students but also accrues a number of benefits to the Library \nitself. \nLITERATURE REVIEW\nAlthough there is a small body of literature relating to the provision of citation \nmanager training for library users, few authors have examined the impact this \ntraining has on libraries themselves.  In his survey of the levels of bibliographic \nsoftware training in Australian academic libraries, East (2001) highlights the \ngrowing trend for libraries to offer hands-on training courses for postgraduate \nstudents and academics in the use of EndNote and similar citation management \npackages.  He suggests that this broadening role for librarians as software trainers \nis a natural progression from their traditional user education activities, such as \nproviding instruction in electronic database searching.  In fact, most studies \n2discussing the methods employed in the delivery of citation manager training show \nthat the training format is usually adapted from approaches used in information \nskills training -- a workshop involving presentations, demonstrations of the resource \nand hands-on practice in guided exercises (Koskinen, 2001; Owen, 1997; and \nRobinson Levy and Hinegardner, 1992).  In looking at the delivery of EndNote \ntraining at Lehigh University library in the United States, Siegler and Simboli (2002) \npoint out that these sessions can have positive rewards for the library, such as the \nenhanced visibility of library services and the facilitation of the use of library \nresources.\n  Likewise, according to East (2001, p. 65), many libraries find that \nEndNote training can \u201craise the profile [of the library] in the academic community\u201d.\nHowever, the provision of EndNote training is not without its drawbacks.  The \nliterature shows that significant staff time and resources are invariably needed to \nteach EndNote workshops as small workshop sizes and long sessions are typically \nrequired, and trainers must have good working knowledge of the software (East, \n2001; Robinson Levy and Hinegardner, 1997; Siegler and Simboli, 2002).  Within \nthese limitations it is difficult for libraries to provide enough workshops to meet the \ndemands of the user community or offer more flexible and advanced learning \noptions.  East\u2019s study reveals that, due to these constraints, many libraries are \nreluctant to wholeheartedly embrace citation manager training.  At MMU, innovative \napproaches to delivering EndNote training have been developed in order to address \nthese limitations, and to take advantage of the positive opportunities that the \nprovision of EndNote training can offer a library.\nDEVELOPMENT OF ENDNOTE TRAINING WORKSHOPS\nThe initial development of EndNote training became the responsibility of the \nResearch Support Librarian, who adapted the format of workshops run by Adept \nScientific (suppliers of EndNote in the United Kingdom).  The first half of the three-\nhour workshop teaches the basics of building an EndNote library, both manually \nand automatically through the use of connection files, import filters and direct \n3export.  The second half introduces Cite While You Write, which uses EndNote \nrecords to create citations and lists of references within Word documents.  The \nworkshops, held in the University\u2019s computer suites, consist of a PowerPoint \npresentation plus live demonstrations of the main EndNote functions.  As each \nfunction is explained, participants are asked to complete a hands-on exercise to \nprovide practical experience of using EndNote.  Each participant is provided with a \nworkbook adapted from the PowerPoint presentation, a general information leaflet \non EndNote, a help sheet on the MMU library catalogue import filter, and a \nfeedback form.\nWhen running workshops, the Research Support Librarian had the support of the \nSerials Librarian who wanted an opportunity to gain teaching experience.  Her \nassistance proved invaluable, particularly during the hands-on part of the workshop \nwhen participants often required individual support simultaneously. The use of two \ntrainers also proved popular with workshop participants who appreciated the \nchange of pace and voice. In academic year 2003-2004, three workshops were run \nfor a combination of academics and postgraduate students.  As support for the \nhands-on component of the workshop proved very demanding, the number of \nparticipants was deliberately restricted to twelve per workshop.  \nTAKING A TEAM APPROACH: THE ENDNOTE CHAMPIONS\nThe workshops were very well-received but, in order to meet escalating demand, it \nwas evident that additional trainers were required.  Library Services Managers, \naware of the positive response from academic staff, showed no reluctance in \ndesignating one member of their team as a local \u201cEndNote Champion\u201d.  The only \nprerequisites were that these people should be enthusiastic about user education, \nhave reasonably good technical skills and be willing to run at least one EndNote \nworkshop per term.  It was agreed that the provision of EndNote training would be \nan additional responsibility but it would not impinge on their existing priorities.\n4In May 2004, a \u201ctraining the trainers\u201d session was run for the new EndNote \nChampions.  Run by the Research Support Librarian and Serials Librarian, the \nprogramme included a standard three-hour EndNote training workshop.  This was \npreceded by a presentation on the advantages to the Library of delivering EndNote \ntraining and followed by an informal discussion on what was expected of the \nChampions.  In order to ensure standardisation throughout the University, the new \ntrainers were asked to use the existing workshop template as the basis of their own \nworkshops.  The template included not just PowerPoint slides but a complete script \nthat the Champions could quote verbatim or adapt as desired.  They were \nencouraged to make workshops more relevant to their own subject areas by \nselecting appropriate databases when demonstrating the connection file, import \nfilter and direct export functions.  It was pointed out that the workshops offered a \ngood opportunity to promote relevant but perhaps underutilised resources.  For \ntraining aimed at the Faculty of Art and Design, an additional component on \nworking with images was created.  Trainers were also provided with a promotional \nflyer, a booking form, a feedback form and a workshop checklist  (a practical list of \nsteps relating to promotion, taking bookings, equipment issues, and providing post-\nworkshop support to participants).  All documentation relating to EndNote training \nwas made available on the Library Intranet.\nThe new EndNote Champions were encouraged to call on the expertise of the \nResearch Support Librarian and the Serials Librarian when running their first \nworkshops.  The more experienced trainers were able to take on the role of main \npresenter with the new trainer playing a supporting role until competence was \ndeveloped and the new Champion felt confident enough to lead the workshops, \nagain with the support of another Champion.   Rehearsals were recommended as a \nway for the new Champions to become familiar with EndNote, the workshop script \nand the computer suites.  \n5In order to facilitate communication within the group, an e-mail discussion list was \ncreated.  This has been used to share experiences, both good and bad, and to build \na sense of camaraderie.  It has also served as a way to communicate news of \nsoftware developments, including additional connection files and import filters.  A \nfurther means of facilitating the sense of collegiality was the organisation of a \nsecond workshop for EndNote Champions held in June 2005 (when it was agreed \nthat this should become an annual event).  Given the geographical spread of the \nUniversity, many members of library staff rarely have the opportunity to meet other \nthan via email and telephone conversations.  The workshop allowed trainers to \nmeet in person and informally discuss experiences and common problems.  It also \nprovided an opportunity to enhance the trainers\u2019 skills:  the Research Support \nLibrarian provided a demonstration of the basics of editing output styles and \ndevelopers of the new online tutorial were able to offer their colleagues a preview.\nBetween June 2004 and July 2005, the library\u2019s EndNote Champions ran a total of \n38 workshops.  These were all targeted at academic staff and postgraduate \nstudents.  On average, there were ten participants per workshop making the total \nnumber of participants more than tenfold that of the previous year.  At the last \ncount, the MMU Library has twenty EndNote Champions drawn from a cross-section \nof library staff ranging from senior managers with years of user education \nexperience to junior members of staff full of enthusiasm and eager to develop new \nskills.  There is at least one Champion from every subject team and every site, plus \nothers from central services such as Library Support Services and the Electronic \nServices Development Team.  As the team-teaching approach continues to be used \nfor workshops, Champions are able to call on trainers from other teams for \nassistance and cross-site collaboration has become the norm.\nDEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE TUTORIALS\nFeedback from academic staff consistently included requests to extend EndNote \ntraining to undergraduate students.  The academics pointed out the difficulties that \n6they had not only in introducing the concept of citing references to undergraduates \nbut also in providing details of how to do this correctly.  EndNote training, they felt, \nwould provide an easy solution to both problems.  Students would learn of the need \nto cite references correctly in their academic work and would be introduced to a \nsimple practical method for doing this.  As citing references accurately can count \nfor as much as 10% of an assignment\u2019s marks, undergraduate students would have \na strong incentive for adopting EndNote.\nWith a full-time equivalent undergraduate population of just under 19,000 students, \nrunning hands-on workshops even with the increased number of trainers was \nsimply not feasible.  Online training was identified as the solution.  Not only had \nresearch demonstrated the successful use of online tutorials for tackling students\u2019 \nreferencing errors (Kendall, 2005)\n \nbut the MMU Library already had considerable experience in the use of INFORMS \nonline tutorial software to provide self-paced, web-based training in the use of \ndatabases and other electronic resources.  \nINFORMS is the outcome of a centrally-funded Joint Information Systems Committee \n(JISC) project led by the University of Huddersfield, University of Oxford and \nLoughborough University in the United Kingdom (Franklin and Stubbings, 2003).\n   It \nprovides an online tool that permits the easy creation of electronic tutorials for \ninformation skills training.\n  INFORMS uses split screens with a step-by-step \ninstructional guide, called the \u201cGuide @ the Side\u201d, appearing on the left-hand side \nof the screen, and live access to the electronic resource on the right-hand side of \nthe screen.  This split-screen format permits users to read information and tips \nabout how to use the resource, while working through guided searches on the live \nresource itself.  The process of creating and formatting an INFORMS tutorial is \nextremely easy, as content can be written on a series of online forms using basic \nmark-up language, which is then automatically converted into the online guide.  \n7The use of INFORMS to teach EndNote skills was something of an innovation as \nINFORMS was designed for use with web-based resources.  There were concerns \nthat, since EndNote is not web-based but sits on the hard drive of the individual PC, \nthe two might not be compatible.  As it turned out, the only problem was that it was \nnot possible for INFORMS to launch EndNote automatically on the right-hand side of \nthe split screen.  Library staff found a practical solution to this problem: the initial \nscreen of the EndNote tutorial provides detailed instructions for users on how to \nopen EndNote, and then how to resize it so that the \u201cGuide @ the Side\u201d remains \nvisible.  \nA further innovation was the inclusion of images which, to the best of our \nknowledge, had not been used in INFORMS tutorials before.  One of the developers \nof MMU\u2019s EndNote tutorial discovered that the use of more advanced HTML tags \n(rather than the basic mark-up language normally used with INFORMS) would allow \nfor the inclusion of images.  As a result, images of EndNote\u2019s toolbar icons, as well \nas various buttons from the databases used for practising direct export, were \ninserted.  Not only do they make the tutorial more visually appealing by breaking \nup the text with colorful graphics, but they also aid navigation and reduce the need \nfor clumsy instructions such as \u201cClick on the red button with the white X on the \nright-hand side of the top of the screen\u201d.\nThe draft version of the tutorial was developed by three EndNote Champions over a \nperiod of six weeks. It was beta-tested in April 2005 by paraprofessional members \nof staff with no previous EndNote experience, and by academic staff and students \nof the University\u2019s Department of Information and Communication.  Feedback was \nenthusiastic.  Seen as particularly positive were the ease of navigation, the clarity \nof the instructions, the constant presence of a table of contents \u201cso if you need to \nrefer back to something you don\u2019t have to flick through all the pages\u201d, and the \navailability of step-by-step instructions on the same screen as EndNote. Inevitably, \nfeedback also suggested some improvements and highlighted some negative \n8aspects of the tutorial.  In particular, the process of opening and resizing the \nEndNote window to produce the split-screen approach was considered cumbersome \nand confusing by some users.  One user pointed out her frustration that she \u201chad to \nwrite down the instructions before being able to open the programme correctly\u201d. \nUnfortunately, this remains unavoidable as long as our access to EndNote is not \nweb-based, but it is hoped that handouts providing step-by-step instructions may \nalleviate some of the difficulties.\nWhere possible, improvements based on the feedback were incorporated into the \nfinal version of the tutorial which was launched in June 2005.  The tutorial has been \nkept to a manageable length of 45 minutes and includes: \n\u00b7 Three methods of input: manual; connection files; direct export\n\u00b7 Information about output styles\n\u00b7 Cite While You Write. \nOwing to their complexity, import filters were not included in this introductory \ntutorial. It was felt that most undergraduate needs would be met by the other three \ninput methods. \nThe tutorial offers an introduction to the software, instructions on how to use \nvarious key features, and practical exercises.  It consists of a series of fifteen steps \nthat users can work through at their own pace.  Although designed to be followed in \na linear fashion, users can jump ahead to whichever sections they feel are most \nrelevant, or return to steps they want to repeat by using the interactive table of \ncontents.  Likewise, although designed to be used on-campus, as the tutorial is \navailable online it can be used by any off-campus users who have access to both \nEndNote and the Internet.  \nThe tutorial can be used in a number of ways.  It can be worked through by \nindividuals on their own or it can form the basis of a workshop led by either library \n9staff or members of academic staff with only basic levels of EndNote expertise.  The \ntutorial has already been incorporated into the Research Methods unit of the MA in \nLibrary and Information Management and will be promoted in student handbooks \nproduced by the Faculty of Art and Design.  Because INFORMS and all tutorials \ncreated using it are essentially \u201cshareware\u201d, MMU\u2019s EndNote tutorial is now \navailable to other United Kingdom Higher and Further Education libraries which are \nfree to copy and customise it for their own training purposes (Manchester \nMetropolitan University Library, 2005a).\nA second INFORMS tutorial on editing output styles was launched in early Sepember \n2005.   Despite the availability of more than 1000 EndNote output styles, it is rare \nto find a style that matches a user\u2019s exact requirements.  Editing output styles is a \nsimple process but there had been what appeared to be an insurmountable barrier \nto the provision of training in this area.  Editing requires access to the EndNote \nprogramme on a PC\u2019s hard drive but, for understandable security reasons, such \naccess is not permitted within the University\u2019s computer suites.  Library-led \nworkshops were, therefore, simply not possible.  Thanks to the INFORMS online \ntutorial, anyone with access to the hard drive (eg, all members of academic staff, \nplus staff and students with a personal copy of EndNote on their home PC or laptop) \ncan now teach themselves how to edit output styles (Manchester Metropolitan \nUniversity Library, 2005b).\nBENEFITS OF ENDNOTE TRAINING\nThe benefits to academics and students of the Library\u2019s EndNote training \nprogramme are clear and include:\n\u00b7 Improved management of references and the use of those references within \ncitations and lists of references. \n10\u00b7 Increased confidence when undertaking academic work.  One student \nreported \u201cfeeling less daunted about doing my dissertation\u201d after attending \nan EndNote workshop. \n\u00b7 Increased familiarity with the electronic resources provided by the Library. \nDuring the course of a workshop, participants are given hands-on \nexperience in using relevant electronic resources with which they are often \nnot familiar. One participant stated that a positive outcome of the course \nhad been that she had learned \u201chow to use library databases more \neffectively\u201d.\n\u00b7 Awareness of other training courses provided by the Library.  A common \nquestion from workshop participants is \u201cDo you run any other training \ncourses?  I\u2019d like to know more about this database\u201d.\n\u00b7 Skills and resources (the INFORMS-based EndNote tutorials) for academic \nstaff to use to incorporate EndNote training into the curriculum.  One of the \nparticipants stated that she now felt \u201cmore confident to teach it to other \npeople\u201d.\nLess expected were the benefits that have accrued to the Library and the individual \nEndNote Champions from taking on the task of EndNote training and support \u2013 \ninitially and erroneously seen by some as an unwanted burden.  The benefits \ninclude:\n\u00b7 Enhancement of the Library\u2019s profile within the University. The Library is \nrecognised and appreciated as the provider of a service that academics \nhave identified as crucial to themselves and to their students, both \npostgraduate and undergraduate.\n\u00b7 Acknowledgement of the educational role played by library staff.  During an \nEndNote workshop, academic staff become students, and librarians, not \nalways recognised for their pedagogical skills, become the teachers. \n11Feedback consistently has included positive comments such as \u201cgood clear \ncommunication and support\u201d and \u201cYou should have been a teacher\u201d.\n\u00b7 Provision of a venue for informal but effective communication between \nlibrary staff and academic staff.  The workshop format, in particular, helps to \nbreak down barriers and allows both participants and trainers to get to know \none another better.  From the point of view of library staff, this may be \nbecause the academics enter into a space in which library staff feel more \nrelaxed, rather than having library staff enter into intimidating spaces such \nas programme committees and faculty boards.\n\u00b7 Increased opportunities for the promotion of electronic services and training \nprogrammes provided by the Library.  \n\u00b7 A chance for members of library staff not traditionally involved in user \neducation to develop new skills and gain valuable experience.\n\u00b7 Mentoring opportunities, with experienced trainers working with junior \nmembers of staff to help develop their user education skills and confidence \nlevels.  \n\u00b7 Experience of alternative training methods; for example, the team-teaching \napproach and the workshop format. The Research Support Librarian \nobserved that \u201cI was afraid of running workshops as, unlike giving a formal \npresentation, I might lose control and couldn\u2019t predict what would happen. \nNow that I\u2019ve developed some coping strategies, I get a real buzz from the \nexcitement the workshop situation generates.\u201d\n\u00b7 Opportunities for library staff to develop new technical skills and experience, \nfor example, INFORMS and, of course, EndNote itself.\n\u00b7 Cross-site collaboration and improved communication within the Library.  \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn recent postings to his weblog, Lorcan Dempsey urged libraries \u201cto \u2018fit in\u2019 with the \nworking practices of their users\u201d (Dempsey, 17 July 2005) and identified \u201cthe \n12lightweight bibliographic apparatus of reading lists and citation managers [as] an \nimportant site of integration\u201d (Dempsey, 5 March 2005).    The MMU Library \nbelieves that the provision of EndNote training to academic staff and students has \nprovided just such a \u201csite of integration\u201d.  It has offered library staff the rare \nopportunity to engage with users within the natural flow of their working practices \nand, in so doing, to meet a need that users themselves have identified as key to \ntheir academic success.  By using this opportunity to its fullest, the Library has \nbeen able to meet users\u2019 additional, if initially unperceived, information needs and \nhas profited in a number of unexpected ways.   \nREFERENCES \nDEMPSEY, L., 17 July 2005.
