The present article describes an interactive \nlecture-based activity centred around a comparison of two contrasting approaches to \ninvestigation of the question Can you smell fear?  A poorly designed experiment (a video \nclip from the TV series Brainiac Science Abuse) is considered alongside the methods \nused in a peer-reviewed paper examining the same issue.  \n \n \nIntroduction: A recent definition sees science as \u201cthe pursuit of knowledge and \nunderstanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based \non evidence\u201d (Science Council, 2009). Implicit within the phrase \u201ca systematic \nmethodology based on evidence\u201d is the need for experiments to be conducted in a manner \nlikely to generate trustworthy data. \n \nIt is for this reason that an ability to design appropriate experiments is seen as an \nimportant component of scientific training at all levels of education (e.g. QAA, 2007; \nQCA, 2007). For example, the UK Quality Assurance Agency\u2019s benchmark statements \nfor university-level Bioscience courses note that \u201cstudents should develop competence in \ncomparing the merits of alternative hypotheses and receive guidance in terms of how to \nconstruct experiments or to make observations to challenge them\u201d (QAA, 2007: p2). \nDespite this vital role in science education, there remains a risk that introduction of these \nimportant design principles can come across as dry (Ruxton and Colegrave, 2006), \nparticularly in the context of a lecture or classroom tutorial in which the students are not \ngoing to perform the experiment themselves. \n \nThe following description of an introductory activity to teach about experimental design \nis offered both as a \u201cready-made\u201d resource and as a paradigm of the use of popular \nscience television programmes as an engaging start-point in discussion of such principles.  \n \n \nActivity: The 50 minute session begins with an introduction to the importance of good \nexperimental design. If a study is badly designed then no matter how many times it is \ncarried out the interpretation of the findings is likely to be flawed. In addition to \u2018wrong\u2019 \nresults, a badly designed experiment may be costly in terms of time, money and even \nharm to participants (Ruxton and Colegrave, 2006). \n \nVideo (example of poor design): Following a brief introduction of this kind, students are \ninvited to watch a five minute clip from UK television programme Brainiac Science \nAbuse. Popular with teenagers, Brainiac takes an irreverent look at science and features a \ndisproportionate number both of explosions and of pretty female assistants; it is \nunashamedly at the \u2018populist\u2019 end of the science documentary spectrum. The episode \nused in the lecture is frequently rebroadcast (my copy was recorded from Sky1 at 07:00 \non January 28th 2009) but the specific clip is also available on the YouTube channel for \nthe series (Brainiac Science Abuse, 2009).  \n 3 \n \nBefore watching the clip, students are briefed to keep a look out for aspects of the \nexperiment that are good and for things about the design of the experiment that are \nunsatisfactory. In the footage shown, presenter Richard Hammond poses the question \n\u201cCan you smell fear?\u201d To tackle this problem, three men are put through different \nexperiences for thirty minutes, after which a blindfolded young woman is invited to smell \ntheir armpits.  One man is sent jogging, one relaxes in a deckchair, and the third \u2013 alleged \nto have a fear of heights \u2013 is taken high into the air on a crane. At the end of the ordeal, \nthe woman correctly identifies the man who has been terrorized on the high platform. \n \nWhen the video is over, the students are given about five minutes to work with their \nneighbours to consider both the good aspects of design in the experiment shown, and how \nit might be improved. After this time their suggestions are collated by the lecturer, and \nthen compared with a pre-prepared PowerPoint slides listing the strengths and \nweaknesses of the research approach (all of the slides from this lecture have been made \navailable to colleagues to download via Slideshare, see Willmott, 2010).  \n \nAlthough limited, there are some features of the Brainiac experiment that are appropriate; \na negative control is included (no exercise, no exposure to fearful circumstances) and all \nthree research subjects carry out their relevant activity for the same duration of time. The \nsame individual is employed to \u2018sniff\u2019 each of them, so variability is not introduced (in \nthis aspect of the study). \n \nHaving said this, however, the list of weaknesses in the design of the experiment is rather \nfuller. The experiment is only performed once, with one \u2018sniffer\u2019 and only one individual \nrepresenting each of the three experimental conditions (rest, exercise, fear). Furthermore, \nthe research subject participating in each activity was not the same and no safeguard was \nmade for differences in natural odour, use of deodorants and\/or digestion of smelly foods \nshortly before the trial. In fact, within the video it is also clear that the proximity of the \nsniffer\u2019s nose to the armpit of each subject is also very different: in one case the man is \nmuch taller than she is, leaving her nose several inches from his armpit; in a second she is \nabout the same height; and in the third case the man does not actually raise his arm to \ndirectly expose his armpit at all. No account is made concerning the possibility of \nolfactory adaptation, the tendency for sensitivity to a specific odorant to decrease \nfollowing repeated or prolonged exposure. \n \nDesigning a better experiment (group discussion): Armed with these observations, the \nstudents are then asked to design an experiment that would investigate the same research \nquestion in a more robust manner. They are given about 10 minutes to work in groups \nagain, after which their suggestions are collated and discussed. \n \nExample of a good study: Finally, the approach used in a recent study is presented. The \nresearch, by Bettina Pause and colleagues, was published in the peer-reviewed journal \nPLoS ONE (Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2009) and serves to illustrate the thought and care \nrequired to design a more scientific consideration of whether it is possible to smell fear.  \n \n 4 \nDetails of the design are given in the PowerPoint slides (Willmott, 2010). In summary, \nthe researchers used a larger number of sweat donors (n=49, of whom 28 were male). The \ndonors were carefully screened to eliminate potential confounding factors, e.g. no \nsmokers or individuals with known neurological disorders were involved. The donors \nwere also given clear instructions regarding a range of lifestyle issues which may have \ninterfered with the study; they were barred from eating spicy foods, garlic or onions for \nmore than 24 hours prior to sweat collection, they were not permitted to use deodorant \nand were only allowed to wash using fragrance-free soap provided by the research team. \n \nSweat was collected from the same set of donors (all students) on two separate occasions \n(and at the same time of day, in case this was relevant). On one day, sweat was collected \nfrom the participants for 60 minutes during which they undertook 3 x 10 minutes of \ncycling. On another day, sweat was collected from the same students for 60 minutes \ndirectly prior to the final oral examination of their degree. Sweat was pooled into one of \nfour categories: anxious males, anxious females, males during sport, and females during \nsport. The researchers also took saliva samples from all participants at several time \npoints, to enable measurement of cortisol and testosterone levels, and asked them to self-\nevaluate their emotions and feelings. \n \nA separate team of 28 students (50% of whom were male) were recruited to smell the \ncollected odours. Once again, a number of criteria such as being a smoker or having a \nhistory of neurological disorders were used to rule out participants and thus minimise the \neffect of confounding factors.  \n \nTwo distinct approaches were employed to determine whether or not these individuals \ncould distinguish between sweat generated during exercise and sweat generated whilst \nafraid (and whether the gender of donor had any bearing). Firstly, the participants were \nasked to rate each odour on a scale of 0 to 8 for intensity, pleasantness, unpleasantness \nand familiarity. They were also asked about their feelings whilst smelling each pooled \nodour. \n \nSecondly, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to monitor brain \nactivity stimulated by each odour, which was delivered to participants whilst within the \nMRI scanner via an adapted oxygen mask. fMRI is a powerful technology in which \nchanges in blood oxygenation levels are used as an indicator of the parts of the brain that \nare active in response to a specific cue or stimulation (Ogawa and Sung, 2007). A small \nnumber of participants were initially exposed to a rose-smelling odour to confirm that the \nsystem was working correctly, i.e. as a positive control. A breathing belt around the chest \nof the participant was used to ensure that they genuinely had taken a breath, and recovery \nbreaths were built into the scheme to guard against olfactory adaptation. \n \nInterestingly, and in contrast to the Brainiac experiment, Prehn-Kristensen et al. did not \ndetect any statistical significant differences when testing for the conscious perception of \nanxiety sweat versus exercise sweat. Differences were noted, however, in the \nsubconscious detection of smell. \n \n 5 \n \nEvaluation: After the session, students were invited via e-mail to complete an online \nquestionnaire regarding this activity. The survey was anonymous and no inducements \n(e.g. course credits) were offered for responses. The survey was made available via the \nvirtual learning environment (Blackboard) for 14 days following the session. A total of \n16 students (20% of cohort) provided feedback on the activity. \n \nUsing a Likert scale from 1= strongly disagree through to 5 = strongly agree, students \nwere asked to respond to the statements \u201cI enjoyed the session on experimental design\u201d \nand \u201cI found the session on experimental design useful\u201d; the average (mean) ratings were \n4.44 and 4.25 respectively, with the lowest score in each case being given by one student \nwho indicated that they \u201cneither agreed not disagreed\u201d in relation to both statements. \n \nStudents were additionally invited to justify their evaluation with free-text comments. \nExamples of these qualitative answers are given in Box 1. \n \nConclusions the use of television clips in teaching per se is not particularly novel. The \ninnovation in the current activity comes from the combined use of an extract from a \npopular science series with two additional phases. Firstly, having seen the weaknesses in \nthe design of the presented experiment, students are invited to utilise their existing \nknowledge to design a better study. This leads, secondly, into consideration of a more \nrobust methodology used to address the same research question and published in a peer-\nreviewed journal (Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2009). Since this journal is an \u201copen access\u201d \npublication no subscription is required and therefore this example of primary research can \nbe read directly by teachers or, indeed, by interested students. \n \nFeedback suggests that the participants found this to be an enjoyable and thought-\nprovoking exercise. Although used here with first year undergraduates, an activity of this \nkind could easily be conducted with upper secondary level students. In the UK, for \nexample, the performance descriptions produced by the Qualifications and Curriculum \nAuthority, as was, for Assessment objective 3 (How Science Works) of A level Biology \nspecifications includes candidates being able to \u201canalyse, interpret, explain and evaluate \nthe methodology, results and impact of their own and others\u2019 experimental and \ninvestigative activities in a variety of ways\u201d and it is noted that good candidates \ncharacteristically can \u201cdevise and plan experimental and investigative activities, selecting \nappropriate techniques\u201d (QCA, 2007). \n \nThe template demonstrated in this account \u2013 combining a video clip of a poorly designed \nexperiment with discussion of a more scientific robust study \u2013 could be replicated using a \ndifferent topic and\/or an extract from an alternative television programme (such as \nMythbusters). All of the resources used in this session \u2013 the video, the peer-reviewed \npaper and the PowerPoint slides developed for the plenary sections of the teaching \u2013 are, \nhowever, available free on the internet and as such are available \u201coff the shelf\u201d for use by \ncolleagues. \n \n 6 \nAcknowledgements: I am grateful to Mark Goodwin for critical evaluation of the \nmanuscript. \n \n \nReferences \nBrainiac Science Abuse (2009) Can you smell fear?
