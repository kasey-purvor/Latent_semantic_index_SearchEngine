There has \nalso been, for about 25 years, an interest in the development of pyroelectric devices for \nthermal imaging 3.  Solid state arrays are of particular interest 4.  These use a thin \nferroelectric ceramic wafer is bonded to a 2D array of amplifiers and multiplexer switches \nintegrated on an application specific silicon integrated circuit (ASIC).  Companies such as \nBAE SYSTEMS Infra-red Ltd. in the UK have developed arrays with 128x256 and 384x288 \nelements 3, while Raytheon in the USA have developed an array with 320x240 elements 5.  \nThese arrays with large numbers (ca 100K) of very small (ca 40\u03bcm) elements provide \nexcellent thermal imaging performance.  Typically they use ceramics such as lead scandium \ntantalate (PST6) or barium strontium titanate (BST7) operated close to their Curie \ntemperatures and under an electrical bias (so-called \u201cdielectric bolometer mode\u201d).  The \ncombination of high permittivity (ca 2000) and very high pyroelectric coefficient (ca 3500 \n\u03bcCm2K-1) with low dielectric loss (ca 5x10-3) under these conditions makes such materials \nwell matched to the very small elements used in thermal imaging. \nThere is also a need for arrays with a lower resolution capability to address areas such as: \nspatially-resolved people sensing (e.g. for monitoring people movements, environmental \ncontrol etc); spatially-resolved flame and fire sensing; security, automotive sensing, traffic \nmonitoring and low resolution imaging radiometry.  A recognisable image is not required for \nthese applications, and a relatively small number (e.g. 16x16) of larger (few hundred \u03bcm \ndimension) elements is adequate.  There have been attempts to address these applications \nwith arrays based upon ferroelectric polymers such as PVDF\/TrFE8,9, with linear arrays \nusing ferroelectric thin films on MgO 10 and with 2D arrays using ferroelectric thin films \n  3\ndirectly integrated onto silicon 11.  The performance of the first is inadequate because of the \nlow pyroelectric figures of merit (FOM) 2 of the ferroelectric polymers, the linear arrays \nrequire a relatively expensive and bulky optical scanning system to provide the 2D spatial \ninformation.  The technology for making 2D arrays based upon ferroelectric thin films on \nsilicon is difficult and not yet ready for the market. \nFerroelectric ceramics based on the PbZrxTi1-xO3 (PZT) system with x\u22481 or 0, offer a \ncombination of pyroelectric figures-of merit that make them ideal for such low resolution \narrays2,3, possessing moderate permittivities (ca 200 to 300), low dielectric losses and good \npyroelectric properties (ca 300 \u03bcCm2K-1).  A particularly important aspect of the \nperformance of such materials is the control of DC resistivity.  (This is in contrast with the \nfine-pitch arrays using bolometer-mode ceramics, for which high resistivity is essential.)  It \npermits the electrical time constant of the element to be fixed without recourse to an external \nresistor and it allows the bias point of the input amplifier on the ASIC to be determined.  \nPrevious work has shown12 that uranium is a very effective dopant both to reduce \npermittivity and loss, and for the control of electrical resistivity in pyroelectric ceramics.  \nThis was originally demonstrated for the PbZrO3-PbTiO3-PbFe1\/2Nb1\/2O3 (PZFNT) system13.  \nCompositions close to PbZrO3 in the PbZrO3-PbTiO3-PbMg1\/3Nb2\/3O3 (PMNZT) system \nhave been shown to possess excellent pyroelectric properties14,15 and uranium has also been \ndemonstrated to be an effective dopant for the control of electrical resistivity in this system16.  \nHowever, there are potential problems with the acceptability of uranium as a dopant and \nthere is therefore a need to find an effective alternative for resistivity control.  The role of \nuranium as a dopant has been previously reported as being due to its multi-valent donor \ncharacter13, as it possesses a valency of between 4+ and 6+ and substitutes on the perovskite \n\u201cB\u201d site for ions with an average valency of 4+.  The observed behaviour of the electrical \nresistivity with dopant level (which first increases and then decreases above a doping level of \n  4\nca 0.2 mol %) has been interpreted as initial compensation for intrinsic acceptor sites caused \nby loss of PbO, followed by the donated electrons acting as charge carriers, which hop \nbetween localised trap-sites.  Based on this observation, there is a good case for the \nexamination of other donor dopants for this role.  Previous work by Takahashi17 has shown \nthat donor dopants such as Nb (B-site) and Sb (A-site) generally act to increase the resistivity \nof morphotropic phase boundary lead zirconate titanate (PZT) compositions, with no \nevidence for a significant decrease in resistivity at high doping levels.  On the other hand, the \nsame paper reports that Cr behaves in a rather similar way to uranium, first increasing and \nthen decreasing the resistivity as the dopant level is increased.  This has also been confirmed \nby other workers18.  There is thus a good case for a more detailed assessment of single and \nmulti-valent dopants on the electrical properties of pyroelectric ceramics.  The study reported \nhere is an assessment of the effects of Sb and Cr in the PMNZT system.  The base \ncomposition chosen for the study was formulated as Pb(Mg1\/3Nb2\/3)0.025(Zr0.825Ti0.175)0.975O3.  \nThis was chosen on the basis of earlier studies14 as having particularly interesting \npyroelectric properties. \nExperimental \nCeramic pellets with the composition Pb{(Mg1\/3Nb2\/3)0.025(Zr0.825Ti0.175)0.975}1-zXzO3 (where \nX= Sb or Cr) were fabricated from 99.9% pure raw materials using a standard mixed-oxide \nprocess as described previously19.  1 at % excess PbO was added to the formulation to help \ncompensate for PbO losses during processing.  Sample densities were all between 94 and \n96% theoretical.  The samples were polished, immersed for approximately 2 seconds in a \ngrain boundary etch [HCL 4.5 vol % \/ HF 0.5 vol % \/ distilled water] and studied using \noptical microscopy and a Cambridge Instruments scanning electron microscope (SEM) with \nbackscatter detector.  The mean grain size was determined using the linear intercept \ntechnique proposed by Wurst and Nelson20.  Evaporated Cr\/Au electrodes were applied for \n  5\nthe electrical measurements.  Resistivity measurements were made on unpoled samples (to \navoid confusion between resistive and pyroelectric currents) and under vacuum (to remove \nsurface moisture).  A thermoelectric heater\/cooler was employed to maintain a constant \ntemperature during the measurement.  A constant applied voltage of 2V was used, with a \nKeithley 6217 electrometer to measure the resistive current.  The temperature was raised \nfrom 15 to 65\u02daC in steps of 10\u02daC.  The current was monitored for 10 minutes at each \ntemperature and was observed to follow an exponential decay: i(t) = i0 e\n1\/t where i(t) is the \ncurrent at time t and i0 is the current at infinite time.  The values of i0 were obtained by \nextrapolation of ln(i(t)) vs 1\/t and used to compute the DC resistivities discussed below.  \nUnpoled dielectric properties (1KHz) were measured from 20 up to 300\u00baC using an \nHP4192A impedance analyser to obtain the Curie temperatures from the maximum in the \npermittivity. \nSamples were poled under an electric field of 3kV\/mm in hot mineral oil at 120\u00b0C for 10 \nminutes, the field being maintained until the oil temperature had cooled to 40\u02daC.  Prior to any \nmeasurements, they were placed in an oven at 50\u02daC overnight with their electrodes shorted to \nremove any space charges that may have been introduced by the poling process.  The \ndielectric properties of the poled samples were measured at 1KHz and 33Hz using a GenRad \n1689 RLC Digibridge.  It should be noted that measurement at a low frequency (a few 10\u2019s \nHz) is very important for any material being considered for use in pyroelectric applications, \nas this is the frequency range in which most pyroelectric devices are operated.  The \npyroelectric coefficients were measured under vacuum using the same rig as that used for the \nDC resistivities.  Two techniques were used.  The first was the linear temperature ramp \n(Byer-Roundy21) method, whereby the temperature (T) of the sample was raised (or lowered) \nfrom 20 to 90\u02daC at constant rate and the pyroelectric current ip measured.  The pyroelectric \ncoefficient p(T) was computed from p(T)=ip\/(A.dT\/dt) (where A is the area of the sample).  \n  6\nThe second technique was method whereby the temperature was oscillated sinusoidally by \n\u00b12\u02daC about a mean temperature, the pyroelectric current being monitored continuously over \nthis period.  It is easy to show that the pyroelectric coefficient can be computed as follows: \n22220 )1(.\n..\n)( CR\nR\nR\nAT\ni\nTp e\nS\nem \u03c9\u03c9 ++\u0394=     (1) \nwhere i0m is the average of the maximum and minimum currents, \u03c9  is the angular frequency \nof temperature oscillation of amplitude \u0394T, A is the electrode area, Re is the resistance of the \nelectrometer (this depends on the instrument range and was taken from the electrometer \nspecification), and RS is the resistance of the sample, measured as described above.  The \nadvantages of this method in comparison with the Byer-Roundy technique are that it is less \nsusceptible to effects due the thermally stimulated release of trapped charge.  Furthermore, it \npermits consideration of the leakage of charge through the resistance represented by the \nsample, which can be significant at the high levels of doping.  The agreement between the \nresults obtained from the two methods was excellent. \nResults \nFigure 1 shows a typical SEM image from a ceramic sample, as observed after polishing and \netching.  The grains are clearly delineated by the etch, which has also revealed the domain \nstructure within the grains.  The grain sizes of the Sb and Cr-doped samples as functions of \nthe doping level are shown in Figure 2.  Average errors on the grain size measurement are \n10%.  It can be seen that both dopants tend act as grain refiners, producing an average grain \nsize of around 4 microns, compared with ca 12 microns in the undoped material.  The Curie \ntemperatures measured on heating are shown in Figure 3.  The Cr doped samples show a \nslight, but non-systematic reduction of Curie temperature with doping level. The hysteresis \nin the transition temperature was virtually the same in all samples, averaging at 4\u00baC.  It \nindicates a weak first-order nature to the transition.  The Sb-doped samples, on the other \n  7\nhand, exhibit a linear decrease in Curie temperature with doping level (z) such that TC = -\n22z+294\u00baC.  In these specimens, the hysteresis was also 4\u00baC up to 1 at % Sb, rising to 7\u00baC \nfor 2 and 3 at % Sb.  This is also indicative of a first order transition, for which hysteresis \nwould be expected to increase as the transition temperature reduces. \nFigure 4 shows (a) the dielectric constant and (b) the loss tangent at 1KHz and 33 Hz of \npoled Sb-doped ceramics as functions of the doping level.  Figure 5 shows the same \nparameters for poled Cr-doped samples.  It can be seen from Figure 4a that the dielectric \nconstant minimises for both frequencies at around 1 at % Sb.  The loss at 33Hz also \nminimises at the same level of doping.  The loss tangent at 1KHz shows a slight tendency to \nrise with increasing frequency.  By contrast, there is a dramatic reduction in dielectric \nconstant with increasing doping level for the Cr-doped specimens, at both frequencies.  At 1 \nKHz, there is a tendency for the loss to minimise at between 0.5 and 1 at % Cr, where it falls \nto <1%.  At 33Hz, the loss also minimises at around 0.5 at % Cr, and then rises very rapidly \nabove this level of doping.  There is a very strong low frequency dependence of the dielectric \nloss in the range 0.5 to 3 at % Cr, probably caused at least to some degree by the contribution \nof the DC conductivity, which increases markedly in this range of doping level (see below). \nFigure 6 shows the pyroelectric coefficients at 25\u02daC for the Cr and Sb-doped ceramics.  The \nresults reported here are the means of the values obtained from the two measurement \nmethods described above.  The average error estimated from distribution of the results from \nthese measurements is estimated as being between 2 and 3%.  There is an interesting contrast \nbetween the Sb and the Cr-doped specimens.  The former shows an almost linear increase in \nthe pyroelectric coefficient with increasing Sb content.  This is almost certainly related to the \nmonotonic reduction in the Curie temperature over the same range of doping levels reported \nabove and is discussed further below.  The Cr-doped specimens, however, show a slight \n  8\nincrease in pyroelectric coefficient up to a doping level of 0.5 at %, followed by a linear \nreduction. \nThe dependence of the DC resistivities at 25\u02daC of the specimens upon doping levels are \nshown in Figure 7.  The effect of the Sb doping is to increase the resistivity and then to hold \nit at that increased level, with a small reduction in resistivity as the doping level is increased \nup to 3 at % Sb.  By contrast, the Cr doping first slightly increases the resistivity and then \nmarkedly reduces it. \nDiscussion \nThere are many interesting aspects to the results reported here.  The first aspect is the effects \nof the dopants upon pyroelectric performance.  This can be measured in terms of the usual \n\u201cfigures-of-merit\u201d (FOM), defined2 as FV=p\/(c\u2019\u03b5\u03b5o) and FD= p\/{c\u2019(\u03b5\u03b5otan\u03b4)1\/2} (where p is \nthe pyroelectric coefficient, c\u2019 the volume specific heat, \u03b5 the dielectric constant, \u03b5o the \npermittivity of free space and tan\u03b4 the loss tangent).  FV is the relevant FOM for devices in \nwhich the device noise is dominated by the readout amplifier.  FD is the relevant FOM when \nthe device noise is dominated by the AC Johnson noise in the element.  The computed values \nof FV and FD at 33Hz are given in Figures 8 a) and b) respectively.  First consider the \ncomposition dependence of FV for the Sb doped specimens.  A reduction in TC would be \nexpected to produce an increase in both p and \u03b5.  As the temperature of measurement (T) \napproaches TC (or vice versa, in this case), then Devonshire theory predicts that \u03b5=\u03b1\/( TC -T) \nand p=\u03b2\/(TC -T)1\/2 and hence FV=\u03b3(TC -T)1\/2 (where \u03b1,\u03b2 and \u03b3 are constants).  By this theory, \np\/(\u03b5)1\/2 should be independent of (TC-T) so that, at constant tan\u03b4, the value of FD should be \nindependent of temperature.  At levels of Sb doping of 1 at % and above, the ratio p\/(\u03b5)1\/2 \nvaries by less than 3%, indicating that the observed increase in pyroelectric coefficient and \ndielectric constant are in this range are probably determined by the reduction in TC caused by \nthe doping.  Similarly, the increase in the 1KHz and 33Hz dielectric losses in this doping \n  9\nrange are probably caused by an increased domain wall mobility.  Donor ions such as Sb act \nto reduce the concentration of oxygen vacancies, which will pin the domain walls, and a \nreduction in TC will also make the domain walls more mobile.  However, the initial reduction \nin dielectric constant and 33 Hz loss at doping levels up to 1 at % Sb cannot be explained \nthrough the reduction in TC.  A reduction in the number of oxygen vacancies will reduce the \nnumber of acceptor centres22.   It is likely that this initial reduction in permittivity and loss is \nassociated with the consequential reduction in the number of mobile charge carriers in the \nlattice, a conclusion that is supported by the observed increase in DC resistivity (see Figure \n7).  It would also appear from the concentration dependence of the DC resisitivity that the \nintrinsic level of oxygen vacancies is fully compensated at ca 1 at % Sb, and above this level \nthe effects of TC reduction can then be observed in that the permittivity and loss both \nincrease.  The changes in FV and FD (33Hz) with composition for the Sb (and Cr) doped \nspecimens are shown in Figures 8a and b respectively.  It can be seen that there is an increase \nin FV of ca 40% in going from the undoped composition to 1 at % Sb, as the permittivity \ndecreases, followed by a reduction in FV above 1 at % Sb as the permittivity increases faster \nthan the pyroelectric coefficient as TC is reduced.  As would be expected from the argument \npresented above, there is a much smaller change in the value of FD with composition, the \nreduction above 1 at % Sb being associated with the observed increase in loss.  The change \nin resistivity as the Sb level is increased is interesting.  As the oxygen vacancies are \ncompensated, the resistivity increases by almost an order-of-magnitude and then stays at this \nincreased level.   \nElectronic conduction in the perovskites in this temperature range is entirely determined by \ncarrier hopping between trapping sites13,22.  Donors or acceptors are not fully ionised, but \nholes or electrons hop between localised traps.  The fact that the resistivity is reasonably \nindependent of the Sb concentration above 1 at % confirms the hypothesis that the \u201cdonor\u201d \n  10\nSb ions are not ionised, the electrons associated with these dopant sites are trapped, and that \ntherefore we do not see a change to electron-mediated hopping conduction as the Sb ion \nconcentration is increased.  Conductivity remains hole-mediated.  The conductivity (\u03c3o) of a \nceramic dominated by this form of hopping conduction is given13 by: \n\u03c3o=A exp (\u2212\u03b1az-1\/3 \u2013 Ea\/kT)       (2) \nwhere A and \u03b1 are constants, a is the lattice parameter, z is the atomic fraction of trap sites, \nEa the activation energy for the hopping process, T the absolute temperature and k is \nBoltzmann\u2019s constant.  The \u201cexp(\u2212\u03b1az-1\/3)\u201d part of this expression is determined by the \naverage hopping distance that a carrier has to traverse between traps and the way it affects \nthe probability of hopping. \nFigure 9 shows a plot of ln(\u03c1) vs 1\/T for the Sb doped specimens.  The activation energies \ndetermined from the linear portions of these curves (ie above 35\u02daC) are given in Table 1.  \nThe Ea does not vary much across the series, confirming that the conduction mechanism does \nnot change across the composition series, and giving an average value of Ea=0.59\u00b10.05eV \nfor hole-hopping conduction.  This value is not too dissimilar from the value of 0.78eV for \nU-doped PZFNTU ceramics at low levels of U-doping, where conductivity is still \ndetermined by the intrinsic acceptor level.  The fact that the conductivity is only weakly \ndependent upon the Sb doping level above 1 at % is presumably because the concentration of \nacceptor centres does not change much above this doping level, under the synthetic \nconditions used for the ceramics and so the average distance for hole hopping between the \nacceptor traps is also unchanged. \nBy contrast with Sb, Cr would be expected to take a valency of 3+ (it is added as Cr2O3) and \nthus might be expected to sit on the B-site as an acceptor.  There is the possibility of Cr \nexisting as Cr5+ 23 or even Cr6+, but these would require very strongly oxidising conditions.  \n  11\nIf we assume that it is present as Cr3+ 24 and is acting as an acceptor, we can understand the \neffects on the dielectric properties (Figure 5) as being due firstly to an increase in oxygen \nvacancies, which will tend to increase the pinning of the domain walls and thus to reduce the \ndielectric constant and loss up to a doping level of 1 at %.  The loss is then increased \n(particularly dramatically at 33Hz) as the DC conductivity is increased.  The pyroelectric \ncoefficient (Figure 6) is also decreased above a level of doping of 1 at % Cr.  This is harder \nto understand and may not be understood (as for Sb doping) as an intrinsic ferroelectric \neffect (as the TC is unchanged).  It may be due to the increase in DC conductivity affecting \nthe efficiency of poling, but this needs further work to understand more fully.  The \nconsequent effects upon FV and FD of the changes in the pyroelectric and dielectric properties \nare shown in Figures 8 a) and b) respectively.  FV is increased at low doping levels as \u03b5 is \nreduced, but then reduces at higher doping levels as p is reduced.  FD is increased \ndramatically at low doping levels as \u03b5 and tan\u03b4 are reduced, but is then compromised at the \nhigher doping levels as p reduces and tan\u03b4 increases. \nThe decrease in the DC resistivity (see Figure 7) with increasing Cr level above 0.2 at % can \nbe understood in terms of Equation 2.  Figure 10 shows a plot of ln(\u03c3o) vs z-1\/3 (\u03c3o=DC \nConductivity) for the Cr-doped ceramics at 25\u02daC.  Here, z is taken as the doping level for the \nCr, which assumes that the Cr acceptor sites act as the hole traps.  The line is a best fit to the \ndata and gives \u03b1=0.38\u00c5-1 (using a lattice parameter determined by powder X-ray diffraction \nof 4.125\u00c5).  Similar results are obtained at 65\u02daC.  This value of \u03b1 for hole-hopping \nconduction between Cr-sites compares with values of \u03b1=0.66\u00c5-1 determined for electron \nhopping conduction between U-sites in U-doped PZFNT13 and \u03b1=0.63\u00c5-1 in U-doped \nPMNZT14.  The variation of resistivity with temperature for the Cr-doped ceramics is shown \nin Figure 11 and the activation energies for conduction in Table 2.  It is clear that there is a \nsignificant change in activation energy in going from the 0 and 0.2 at % Cr samples to the 0 \n  12\nsamples with.5 at % Cr and higher.  For the first two, the Ea values are very similar to the \nvalues obtained with all the Sb doped samples.  It can also be seen from the temperature \nplots that these two samples have very similar resistivities across the range of temperatures \nexplored.  These results imply that the sites for the hole traps are the same in both these \nsamples and in the Sb-doped ceramics.  Presumably at the 0.2 at % doping level there are \ninsufficient Cr3+ acceptor sites to act as a significant trap for the holes in comparison with the \nintrinsic hole trapping sites.  For the other samples with higher Cr doping levels, the lower \nactivation energy for hopping (average 0.38\u00b10.03eV) coupled with the linear ln(\u03c3o) vs z-1\/3 \ndependence implies that the hole traps are now the Cr3+ sites.  The Ea measured here is very \nsimilar to the values of Ea=0.37\u00b10.01eV determined for U-doped PZFNT13 and 0.28\u00b10.02eV \nfor U-doped PMNZT14 ceramics.  In these cases, the trapping sites are thought to be for \nelectrons. \nConclusions \nThe electrical properties of Sb and Cr-doped Pb(Mg1\/3Nb2\/3)0.025(Zr0.825Ti0.175)0.975O3 \nceramics have been studied in detail.  Both dopants act as grain refiners.  It has been shown \nthat Sb acts as a donor dopant, linearly reducing the Curie temperature and increasing the \npyroelectric coefficient and the dielectric constant.  At low levels of Sb doping, the dielectric \nconstant and loss are reduced (at both 33Hz and 100Hz).  The combination of these electrical \nproperties produces 33Hz pyroelectric FOM\u2019s as follows: FV peaks at 3.8x10-2 m2C-1 and FD \npeaks at 1.2x10-5 Pa-1\/2.  The dopant concentration dependent behaviour of the FOM and the \nelectrical resistivity have been explained in terms of the changes in TC and the behaviour of \nthe Sb dopant as a donor ion which reduces oxygen vacancy concentration, but which does \nnot contribute electrons to the conduction process.  Cr acts as an acceptor dopant, having \nlittle effect on the Curie temperature, but reducing the dielectric constant and loss and \nmarkedly reducing the pyroelectric coefficient.  Above 0.5 at % Cr, the resistivity reduces \n  13\nrapidly.  The pyroelectric FOM calculations give: FV peaking at 3.6x10-2 m2C-1 and FD at \n1.9x10-5 Pa-1\/2.  The behaviour of Cr as a dopant has been explained in terms of it acting as \nacceptor dopant with conduction mediated by the hopping of holes between Cr3+ sites.  \nAcknowledgements \nThe financial support of EPSRC through grant number GR\/L91436\/01 is gratefully \nacknowledged.
