While the \nrising itself is well known, its manifesto has never been examined in detail. Probably \nbased on a sermon to Venner\u2019s congregation, it displays a defiant conviction that the \nRestoration could be understood as part of God\u2019s providential plan, the next step towards \nthe imminent kingdom of Christ on earth. But it also reaches out to a much wider \nconstituency, all the supporters of the \u201cGood Old Cause\u201d, offering a programme that \nmight appeal to many radicals. And the author draws on secular, republican discourse to \nbuttress his apocalyptic claims, revealing close links between even the most extreme \nFifth Monarchists and wider currents of interregnum radicalism. \n 2\n \nKey words: Fifth Monarchists; millennium; Good Old Cause; rebellion \n   \n \n \nThe Fifth Monarchist uprising in London in January 1661, led by Thomas Venner and \nmembers of his Swan Alley congregation, was long remembered as the last, desperate \noutburst of the revolutionary fervour generated by the English Revolution.1 Over forty \npeople were killed in street fighting, with many others wounded. When it was all over \nSamuel Pepys reflected that it was \u201cA thing that never was heard of, that so few men \nshould dare and do so much mischief\u201d.2  Venner was subsequently hanged, drawn and \nquartered, and twelve of his surviving companions were also put to death.  Plotting \nagainst the restored Stuarts was to remain endemic for years, as the work of Richard \nGreaves has established,3 but the rebels\u2019 manifesto stands as a final, defiant assertion and \nexposition of radical dreams. While the rising itself is noted in most histories of the \nRestoration, its manifesto has been generally overlooked. Yet A Door of Hope: or a Call \nand Declaration for the gathering together of the first ripe Fruits unto the Standard of \nour Lord, King Jesus contains much of interest, and some surprises, amidst its fiery \nmillennial rhetoric. This article makes some amends for past neglect.4  \n \n   The radical movements of the English Revolution are no longer a fashionable subject \nfor historical research. Even thirty years ago, when academic and public interest was at \nits peak, the Fifth Monarchists occupied a marginal position. They barely figured in \n 3\nChristopher Hill\u2019s influential The World Turned Upside Down (1972), which discussed \nLevellers, Diggers, Ranters and Quakers in some detail. Though revolutionary in their \ntotal rejection of the political, social and ecclesiastical structures of their age, the Fifth \nMonarchists espoused a theocratic agenda which did not sit comfortably within Hill\u2019s \npicture of egalitarian radicals striving for \u201csomething far nobler\u201d than either their own \nworld or indeed ours.5 For their part, most undergraduates found the Fifth Monarchist \nmentality almost impossible to relate to the modern age. In that respect, at least, times \nhave changed: the rise of fundamentalist, theocratic Islamist movements in Iran, \nAfghanistan and Iraq has made such ideologies all too familiar today, a development \nparalleled by the emergence of extremist groups within the Jewish and Christian faiths. \nParadoxically, it is the Fifth Monarchists rather than communist Diggers who now appear \nmost \u201crelevant\u201d to our age. \n \n    The Fifth Monarchists emerged in the years immediately following the king\u2019s \nexecution in January 1649, fired by hopes that such an unprecedented event proved the \nmillennium was at hand, but equally by fears that the Rump and New Model Army had \nno intention to assist in its birth. Some initially pinned their hopes on Oliver Cromwell as \na second Moses who would lead the people into the promised land, but with the fall of \nthe Nominated (\u201cBarebone\u2019s\u201d) Parliament in December 1653, they agreed in viewing \nCromwell as an apostate and his regime as part of the Babylonian tyranny.6  It was thus \nfor the \u201csaints\u201d themselves to act as God\u2019s instruments. In their first years, to 1653, the \nFifth Monarchists had acted as a pressure-group, agitating against the Rump and then \npressing more radical policies on Barebone\u2019s Parliament; thereafter they adopted a \n 4\nposition of outright opposition to the Protectorate. The movement is best characterised as \na radical  alliance, rather than as a sect or denomination.  Its supporters shared a core \nbelief in their duty to bear witness against an illegal and ungodly regime, and thereby to \npromote the kingdom of Christ, which they viewed as imminent and inevitable despite \nthe apostasy of so many. Beyond that we find a striking diversity of opinion, with \nindividuals and congregations retaining earlier or parallel identities and convictions as \nCongregationalists or Baptists (whether Particular, i.e. Calvinist, General, or Seventh-\nDay). While they succeeded in developing a loose national network, there was often \nfriction over these differences and even more over the nature of political resistance. Was \nit sufficient simply to repudiate the regime, verbally or in print? Or was it their duty to \ntake up arms, either relying on divine protection in the face of seemingly impossible \nodds, or actively seeking allies? The collapse of the Protectorate in 1659 raised their \nhopes once more, but these hopes were quickly dashed as the Commonwealth \ndisintegrated and Charles II was restored to his throne with apparently miraculous speed \nand ease. \n \n   In one of his later works, The Experience of Defeat (1984),  Christopher Hill explored \nhow radicals came to terms with the total collapse of the Revolution and their apparent \nabandonment by God. For those who thought within a providentialist mind-set, as most \nradicals did,  these were terrible days; for the divine providences of the 1640s, the \noverthrow of the Bishops, King and Lords, were all reversed. Did that mean their entire \nreading of the preceding twenty years had been wrong? Or, an equally dismal thought, \nthat God had turned his back on an ungrateful and self-seeking people? In the months \n 5\nfollowing the Restoration the most radical Fifth Monarchists firmly rejected any such \ninterpretation of events. The congregation meeting in Swan Alley, off Coleman Street \n(only a stone\u2019s throw from London\u2019s Guildhall), had been the most militant group \nthroughout the Cromwellian Protectorate. Its leader, the cooper Thomas Venner, had \nemigrated to New England in the late 1630s and had spent over a decade in Salem and \nBoston before returning to England in 1651 to help build Zion at home. When \nCromwell\u2019s Protectorate \u201cbetrayed\u201d that cause, Venner was prominent among those who \nsought to build a militant alliance against the regime, by drawing in radical Baptists and \ndisgruntled republican army and naval officers. And when these negotiations failed, he \nand his followers attempted their own uprising, in April 1657. But the plotters had been \ninfiltrated by Secretary Thurloe\u2019s agents, and many of the would-be rebels were arrested \nas they arrived at their rendezvous. Remarkably, their lives were spared. Though held in \nthe Tower Venner was never brought to trial, and was released from prison in 1659 \nfollowing the fall of the Protectorate.7 Few rebels in the seventeenth century enjoyed an \nopportunity to try again. \n \n   A Door of Hope is a small quarto pamphlet of two sheets and only 16 pages. \nUnderstandably, the title-page affords no clue to the identity of author or printer, and it \nwas presumably disseminated by hand. Venner himself may have penned it, though a \nmore likely candidate is his son-in-law William Medley, who had subscribed the \nmanifesto of the 1657 rebellion, A Standard Set Up, as \u201cscribe\u201d.8  While the two tracts \nshare the same core message, justifying armed insurrection to advance the kingdom of \nChrist on earth, they are very different in style and flavour. A Door of Hope is an \n 6\nimpassioned tirade, probably reworked from an inflammatory sermon to the Swan Alley \nfaithful.9  Several passages appear clearly designed to work the audience to a frenzy, with \nrhetorical questions- more than twenty in all- inviting its vocal response. In one such \npassage the author\/preacher insists that the Restoration had been engineered by treachery:      \n \nAnd now to suffer all these things, and lose our Birth-rights, and to entail \nPersecution, Slavery, Popery, and Idolatry, to our Posterities for ever \u2026 is \ngrievous;  but to suffer them from the Cavaliers, an old, beaten Enemy, and that \nwithout striking a blow, or bleeding in the Field for that which is much better then \nour Lives (for as a Romane could say, There is no necessity that I should live, but \nthere is a necessity that Rome should be relieved) is the Aggravation. For how \ndid this old Enemy come in? did he beat us in the Field? did he win it with his \nsword? is our Cause lost? or is our God dead? no! how then? Why, by lies \u2026 by \nhellish plots and contrivement (A Door, 8). \n \nWe can picture the impassioned preacher and the roars of his audience. So could the \nauthor of a fierce attack on the rising and its manifesto, who observed that \u201c\u2019tis more then \nprobable, that Venner\u2019s Preachment blew them into so sudden Action\u201d.10  But the passage \nis interesting on other grounds too: we note the allusions to birth-rights, and the linkage \nof godly zeal with the virtue of the anonymous Roman (perhaps Horace). While it is \nhighly unlikely that Thomas Hobbes ever read A Door of Hope, this passage would have \nreinforced his conviction that the classics could breed dangerously subversive ideas.11 \nThe tract repeatedly marries millennial fervour with secular principles and concerns, \n 7\ndrawing on ideas and information absorbed from contemporary political ideas, \nnewspapers and a grammar-school education.  \n  \n   The last five pages of the text are very different in style and character. It was not \nunusual in this period for printed sermons to carry other material as appendices, as seems \nto be the case here.12  Headed \u201cSome choice Teachings and Hints\u201d, this section grapples \nwith the biblical prophecy of the two witnesses described in Rev.11, offering an \ninterpretation that draws heavily on the commentaries of Joseph Mede, the Cambridge \ntheologian, John Tillinghast, a Fifth Monarchist minister and biblical commentator, and \nClavis Apocalyptica, a German text translated into English by Samuel Hartlib in 1651. \nThe witnesses are identified, conventionally enough, as true Christian believers, faithful \ndown the ages in the face of persecution and destined to play a crucial role in the final \nstages of God\u2019s providential design. But the exposition builds to a dramatic and highly \nunconventional conclusion, directly related to the preceding call to arms. \n \n   A Door of Hope begins in typically pugnacious style by defending the execution of \nCharles I as a murderer, tyrant and traitor, citing in support the bellicose parliamentary \ndeclaration of 11 February 1648, which had defended the Commons\u2019 vote of No Further \nAddresses by depicting the entire reign of Charles I as a conspiracy to impose tyranny \nand popery on England.13  A Door also expressed delight that even \u201cGermany was not \nwithout a witness (that Learned and Judicious Author of Clavis Apocalyptica) to the \nRighteousnesse of that Sentence\u201d (1). But the author readily acknowledges that God has \nchosen to permit the restoration of the late king\u2019s son, identified with scant respect as \u201cC. \n 8\nS\u201d (i.e. Charles Stuart), a \u201cstrange Providence, whereat most are confounded\u201d. \nInterpreting divine providence was central to the faith of Fifth Monarchists, as of all \nreligious radicals. While most radicals came to the regretful conclusion that God had \nabandoned the English for their manifold sins and shortcomings, A Door offered a very \ndifferent interpretation. God had permitted the apparent ruination of the godly cause only \nin order to test the truly faithful, \u201cto punish and spue out of his mouth a Lukewarm \nPeople\u201d, and to make the ensuing vindication of his cause all the more glorious. Though \nthe profane might triumph in the return of Charles Stuart, the godly rejoiced to see them \n\u201cbrought as Foxes into the Snare\u201d. The Restoration marked simply the latest stage in \nGod\u2019s unfolding design, and the godly were accordingly untroubled by the apparent \ntriumph of the cavaliers at \u201cthe coming in of their poor wretched King, at whom \u2026 we \nlaugh, and have them in derision\u201d (1-2). That echoed Psalm 2:4, where the godly laugh at \nfoolish and proud kings who set themselves against the Lord. The writer was convinced \nthat biblical parallels offered both comfort and reassurance to those dismayed by \nEngland\u2019s present plight.  He cited Jer. 22:7-8 to remind them how the Lord had led the \nJews out of captivity, and he placed Charles II in a line of persecuting tyrants stretching \nfrom Nimrod through Nebuchadnezzar to show how often God had raised up kings only \nin order to throw them down (1-2). Providence, he noted, had been leading the \n\u201cProtestant Cause\u201d to similar apparent ruination throughout Europe. The godly were \nbeing persecuted in France, Savoy, Bohemia and Poland, while the deaths in 1660 of the \nking of Sweden (Charles X) and the Prince of Transylvania (Gy\u00f6rgy R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, mortally \nwounded in battle against the Ottoman Turks) foreshadowed further oppressions abroad \n 9\nas in England (7). God\u2019s glory and the triumph of the saints would be all the greater when \ntheir persecutors were swept aside.    \n \n   It was now the duty of true believers, the \u201ctwo witnesses\u201d, to further God\u2019s providential \ndesign. Giving thanks for having survived uncorrupted during the \u201cwicked Apostacy of \nO.C.\u201d  (Oliver Cromwell), they would now  \u201cgird on a Sword for Christ\u201d and dedicate \ntheir lives and estates to \u201cthe Lord King Jesus\u201d as soldiers in the Lamb\u2019s army. And their \nmission would extend far beyond establishing godly rule in England; they vowed to \u201cgo \non to France, Spain, Germany, and Rome, to destroy the Beast and Whore \u2026 to bring not \nonly these but all the Nations to the Subjection of Christ that the Kingdome may be the \nLords\u201d (3). \n \n   To undertake such a design, they would clearly need to draw in many others. A Door is \ndeliberately inclusive, appealing repeatedly to all godly \u201cbrethren\u201d, \u201csaints\u201d and \n\u201cwitnesses\u201d. The Fifth Monarchists themselves are never mentioned as such by name.14  \nInstead the author anticipated the glorious day when power would pass to the \u201cSaints \n(without respect had to any particular form or judgement)\u201d (9). Going further, he urged \nall those dismayed by the fall of the Commonwealth who thus \u201cown at least the negative \npart of our Cause\u201d to join in the crusade, for \u201cthis good and wholesome Principle of \nChrists Government is so large, that it involves every honest Interest\u201d; and \u201cwhoso hath a \nheart to rise up for God against the Pope, his Bishops, and Hierarchy, and against these \nCavaliers, whose wickedness it is not fit to name, who have already polluted the Land as \nvenemous and unclean Creatures; here is a call and opportunity for them\u201d (4). Even \n 10\nuncommitted readers could rest assured they had no reason to oppose the uprising, for \nthey had nothing to fear; the saints respected private property, their army would be \nrigorously disciplined, its soldiers regularly paid, and no harm would befall any except \nthose who resisted by force (10).  \n \n   In seeking to draw in a wider body of potential supporters the author was of course \nacknowledging political and military realities. His strategy was far from novel, however; \nthroughout the Protectorate the Fifth Monarchists had sought to build alliances with \ndisaffected Baptists, republicans, and army and naval officers.15 Vavasor Powell\u2019s A \nWord for God (1655), a Fifth Monarchist petition from Wales, had championed \u201cthe \nadvancement of Christ\u2019s kingdom\u201d, \u201cthe privileges of parliament\u201d and \u201cthe liberty of the \nsubjects\u201d within the space of a single sentence.16  Venner and his followers had been at \nthe heart of an attempt to build an anti-Cromwellian alliance in 1655-6, during which Sir \nHenry Vane\u2019s A Healing Question had been mooted as the possible basis for a common \nplatform.17 The preacher John Rogers had responded to the failure of Venner\u2019s first rising \nby instituting a series of weekly meetings in London between representatives of different \ncongregations (including Venner\u2019s), hoping to reach out once more beyond the Fifth \nMonarchists\u2019 own ranks. Rogers indeed was soon urging a union between the godly and \nthe Commonwealth party, taking Sir Henry Vane as his guide and inspiration.18  And as \nthe Protectorate stumbled early in 1659, radicals urging the promotion of the \u201cGood Old \nCause\u201d frequently drew on both millenarian and republican ideology.19 The Cause of \nGod, and of these Nations, an anonymous tract published early in March 1659, identified \ngodly rule and civil liberty as twin causes which must advance hand in hand. \u201cThe Cause \n 11\nof God\u201d naturally took priority, he explained, but it incorporated the cause of secular \nfreedom, and \u201cembraces in its Arms and bosome, the Natural Rights and Liberties of \nmen\u201d.20  Early in May, with the Protectorate now swept away, Christopher Feake, a \nleading Fifth Monarchist preacher, urged all \u201cworthy Patriots\u201d to rally to the \u201cGood Old \nCause\u201d; and ended his history of the preceding twenty years of upheaval by identifying \nthe republican Commonwealthsmen and Fifth Monarchists as the only \u201chonest\u201d, \u201cpublic\u201d \ninterests in a world of private, sectional greed. All faithful men should join in the work of \nadvancing Christ\u2019s kingdom, he wrote; even \u201cBrethren of the Classical-way\u201d \n(Presbyterians) would be welcome, provided they were modest and sober, not of a \u201cpert, \nimposing Disposition\u201d.21 Livewell Chapman, the leading publisher of Fifth Monarchist \ntracts, was equally active in 1659 producing secular, republican interpretations of the \nGood Old Cause.22  The rising of January 1661 is rightly seen as a desperate venture by \nFifth Monarchist extremists, but the rebels themselves were pursuing a  well-established \nstrategy designed to galvanise all supporters of the Good Old Cause. \n \n   In reaching out to this wider constituency A Door accordingly shifts repeatedly \nbetween the rhetoric of millennial fundamentalism and secular, republican arguments. A \nsustained rant against prelacy, common-prayer, organs, surplices, lawn sleeves, hoods, \naltars, bowing, kneeling \u201cand such whorish trash and Trinkery\u201d is followed by a far more \nsober passage promising honest government with social, economic and legal reforms, and \npledging that \u201cwhatsoever can be named of a common or publick good, we mean by the \nKingdome of Christ, in the Government of the Common-wealth\u201d (4-5). But the dominant \nreligious strain then quickly reappears, with a bitter tirade against the moral decadence of \n 12\nRestoration England, and \u201cthe open profaneness that rages in our streets\u201d. The author \nexclaims at the \u201chellish blasphemy\u201d of men \u201cdrinking healths to the confusion of Zion, \nand her King (daring the most high [Christ] to his face), and if he be her King, let him \ncome and save her\u201d (5). Such evils now abounded: \n \nhow hath the greatest sins, Swearing, Drunkenness, Sabbath-breaking, \nWhoredome, Pride, Lasciviousness, Stage-playes, Blasphemy, Superstition, \nIdolatry been propagated and countenanced since their coming in, as a new life \ngiven to the slain Serpent (5). \n \nComing from an author who had detested the Cromwellian regime, the passage offers \nstriking testimony to the cultural revolution that had accompanied the Restoration. Such \nprofanities were incompatible with the values of King Jesus, he continued, and since their \nperpetrators were the champions of the restored monarchy it followed \u201cthat the K. [King] \nis a profest Enemy, a Rebel and Traytor to Christ\u201d (5). And these evils were compounded \nby the rage of old \u201cMalignants\u201d, free once more to persecute the godly \u201cunder the notion \nof Fanaticks\u201d (6). \n \n   Far greater troubles lay ahead, the author warned, presenting chilling evidence of \u201cthe \ndesign of a Butchery and Massacre of the honest Party\u201d by \u201cthe old cursed Popish Party\u201d \n(6). The fear of popery, so potent in 1640-2 in the wake of Laudian innovations and the \nIrish Rebellion, was once again a real and plausible menace, and A Door exploited it to \nthe full. \u201cEpiscopacy and Common Prayer is but the door to something worse\u201d, it warned, \n 13\nidentifying a \u201cGrand Conspiracy\u201d to root out Protestantism altogether. In support it \npointed to the papists swarming around Westminster, some of them guilty of the Irish \nmassacre, the return of the old queen, Henrietta Maria, \u201cwho is said to hate an English \nProtestant so, that she cannot endure the sight of them\u201d, \u201cmultitudes of the cruel bloody \nSpaniards\u201d attending the Spanish ambassador, and similar ruffians surrounding Prince \nRupert. All this pointed to a bloody design in which the pope, king of Spain and \nHabsburg Emperor all had a hand: \u201cWe know the Papists Principle; No faith is to be kept \nwith Hereticks: let us remember France and Ireland; and not forget Piedmont, whose \nwounds bleed yet fresh in our memories. They are making our Throats bare to the Knives \nof their Butchers\u201d (6-7).23  \n \n   A Door was thus justifying a war both \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cdefensive\u201d, in which the saints \nwould establish Christ\u2019s kingdom on earth and thereby preserve the people from popery, \nmassacre and oppression. Charles II was simultaneously a tyrant and a traitor to the true \nKing, Jesus, and the godly were freed from any obligation to obey him. Drawing for \nsupport on the secular language of contract theory, it explained that the state could have \nno claim to their allegiance for it offered them no protection, the fundamental purpose of \nall human government: \n     \nAnd these men themselves have set us free from the Bonds of Subjection; for we \nhave no benefit by the Government of this bloody Family, neither are we \ncomprehended within the Verge of their Protection: Wherefore they cannot justly \n 14\nchallenge any Obedience from us by the Law of Nature or Nations: For a man is \nnot bound to pay him Subjection who seeks his Destruction (8). \n \nThe \u201cLaw of Nature and Nations\u201d was generally interpreted as morally informed reason \nenshrining an inalienable right to self-preservation. Widely invoked in the 1640s against \nan allegedly tyrannical king, it now justified the godly in taking up arms against the \nrestored Stuart monarchy which threatened their destruction (7). Implicit within it was \nthe principle of popular sovereignty. Parliamentary apologists since Henry Parker had \nargued that sovereignty was fundamentally rooted in the people, who had set up kings to \nprotect them and could legitimately resist any king who betrayed that trust. Extending the \nargument, the Leveller Richard Overton argued in 1647 that the people were equally free \nto repudiate their allegiance to a now \u201cdegenerate\u201d Parliament which similarly sought \ntheir destruction.24 The concept of a social contract was also central to the classical \nrepublican thinking that flourished in the 1650s alongside political languages derived \nfrom the Bible and common law.25  While some religious radicals scorned the secular \nlanguage of republicanism, we have seen that others readily combined the two ideals.  \n    \n   It comes as no surprise, however, to find A Door\u2019s ensuing peroration reverting to \nprovidential theory, couched in the most extreme terms: \n \nAnd this is our joy, that our God has bound himself \u2026 to appear for his People: \nAnd if God should not appear for the poor Remnant of Jacob, but suffer them ... \nto fall before Papists, and Cavaliers, and prophane, drunken, damning, swearing, \n 15\nIdolatrous, Adulterous, wicked and ungodly men; and should suffer the Cause of \nthe Papists, of the bloody Family of the Stuarts, of the old, bloody, Popish, \nwicked Gentry of the Nation, of the drunken, dumb, Popish, scandalous Clergy, to \nget the upper hand of his own Cause, and should suffer all our Reformation to be \nlost, then what would become of his great Name? It was because he could not \nbring them into the good Land (will the Enemy say) that he has destroyed them in \nthe Wilderness (8). \n \nOr in short: the rebellion must succeed, for failure would irrevocably destroy God\u2019s own \ncredit and credibility. An astonishingly presumptuous reading of divine providence, this \nwould have struck most contemporaries as horrid blasphemy. But the rebels were  \nconfident in their interpretation of biblical prophecy and their own duty, and happy to \nsacrifice their lives in advancing God\u2019s work, if need be; for \u201ccertainly if we be deceived, \nGod has deceived us\u201d for his own inscrutable ends (an echo of the prophet Jeremiah\u2019s \ncry, Jer. 21:7) (8). \n   \n   The final three pages of the main text outline the rebels\u2019 programme, appealing to \u201cour \nBrethren\u201d in London and every county to join in their work. The author begins by \nrepudiating any national parochial church system, damned as antichristian even in its \npurest form, under Cromwell\u2019s Triers. The true gathered churches, \u201cpurged and purified\u201d, \nwill blossom and grow with a multitude of new converts (9). Godly magistrates will rule \nthe land, enforcing the laws of God enshrined in scripture (the Mosaic laws) (9-10). \n\u201cCivill Liberty, and Rights of men (which with every mans Propertie we assert)\u201d, will \n 16\nflourish in this new order (10). To prepare the way, antichristian forms will be swept \naside. Taxes, tithes, excise and customs will be removed, \u201cas far as Oppressive and \nunlawfull\u201d, and \n \nslavish tenures of Land, Oppressions of Landlords, Monarchy and Lordship as \nwell in Church as State; so also in Cities, Societies and Families, wherein the \nRights of younger Brethren will be vindicated according to Law, \u2026 and the \nNimrod spirit and Monopolies of elder Brethren (unto whom as Kings in the \nFamily, the younger Brethren are Slaves and Subjects, which is one grand branch \nof Tyranny, and Interest of Monarchy) pulled down, whose Interest nevertheless, \nby right of Primogeniture, is asserted according to the Kings Law, to wit two-\nfold: For the ballance of Lands must be adequate to the Government of the \nCommonwealth (9-10).  \n \nThis is a remarkable passage, despite its highly compressed language. It recalls the \nLevellers\u2019 condemnation of oligarchy and monopoly in the government of London and its \nCompanies, while the imagery of the older\/younger brother, applied to the entire edifice \nof socio-economic privilege as well as the family, echoes Gerrard Winstanley. So, of \ncourse, do the branches of the tree of tyranny, or kingly power, the central motif of \nWinstanley\u2019s A New Years Gift (1650).26 By contrast, the author is also familiar with the \npolitical language of private and public interests, while the linkage between patterns of \nland-ownership and forms of government suggests he was familiar with James \nHarrington\u2019s Oceana, or at least its central ideas. It provides another pointer to the \n 17\nconnections between even the most extreme Fifth Monarchists and more \u201cmainstream\u201d \nrepublican currents. Livewell Chapman, the Fifth Monarchists\u2019 main publisher, was also \nthe publisher of Oceana. John Rogers provides another obvious connection, engaging in \nprint with Harrington in 1659 but also closely associated with Venner\u2019s congregation.27  \n \n   This section of A Door was building upon an earlier passage that outlined the rebels\u2019 \nreforming agenda. There the author explained that by \u201ca well ordered Common-wealth\u201d \nhe meant  government by men of integrity, dispensing speedy and impartial justice based \non the \u201cwholesome\u201d Law of God, and bringing relief to orphans and widows. He did not \nelaborate how such men would be chosen, but offered rather more detail on the legal \nreforms proposed. The law of debt would be transformed on the basis of both justice and \nmercy, bringing relief to creditors and debtors alike, unlike the existing practice of \nindefinite imprisonment for debt. He urged that thieves no longer be hanged \u201cbut that \nrestitution be made according to the [Mosaic] Law, and the Malefactor sold, or made to \nwork out his redemption in some house of Correction, which in few years would make us \nfewer Thieves than a thousand Gallowses\u201d. The poor would be set to work, and \nprotection offered to sustain English manufactures and trade, with a ban on the export of \nunfinished leather and fuller\u2019s earth (used in the bleaching of cloth). Timber supplies \nwould be protected too (4-5). The passage gives only a few glimpses of the future \nkingdom of Christ on earth- the author was more concerned with the cosmic battle that \nmust precede it- but we have enough to see that its arrangements would be closely \nattuned to the practical concerns of London tradesmen and artisans. We note too that it \nfocuses on those aspects of law reform most likely to enjoy broad support, while passing \n 18\nsilently over the draconian penalties for moral offences also enshrined in the Mosaic \ncode.28  \n \n   A Standard Set Up, the manifesto of the abortive 1657 rising, had gone into rather more \ndetail on several of these points. It proposed a form of government modelled on the old \nJewish sanhedrin, a council comprising men of integrity and virtue, which had also \ninspired the Nominated (or \u201cBarebone\u2019s\u201d) Parliament of 1653. This body would control \nthe armed forces, but would have no authority to impose a state church, nor to violate \n\u201cany of the Foundations of Common-Right, and Freedome, which are, or shall be agreed \nupon\u201d, a proviso recalling the fundamental rights enshrined in the Levellers\u2019 \n\u201cAgreements of the People\u201d. Its members would represent the whole nation but be \nchosen by \u201cthe Saints\u201d alone, and would serve for an indefinite period subject to \nconfirmation or dismissal by the electors at the end of each year, a variant of Leveller \nplans for annual parliaments. Courts would be held in each county, four times a year, to \ndeal with major crimes, with judges sitting monthly in every market-town to handle civil \nsuits and lesser criminal cases. Men would plead their own causes, with state-appointed \ncounsel assisting in complex cases. Impressment into the army would be forbidden, tithes \nand excise abolished, and taxation strictly curtailed. Oppressive conditions applying to \ncopyhold and customary tenures of land would be \u201cclean removed\u201d, sweeping away \nheriots, fines and other dues.29 Most of these proposals were probably still supported by \nthe 1661 rebels.  \n \n 19\n   The main text of A Door ends with a rallying call to all public-spirited readers to join \nthe great work, and an assurance that truly penitent members of the \u201cold [Cromwellian] \nArmy, which God hath laid aside\u201d, would be welcomed too. But it acknowledged that \n\u201cyoung Converts ... are like to be the choicest instruments in this Work\u201d (11). One of \nSecretary Thurloe\u2019s informants, reporting on a meeting back in 1656, had noted that \nyoung people, many of them apprentices, dominated the Swan Alley assembly, and that \nthe preacher\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric had been explicitly targeted at them.30 Its focus on \nglory, heroic adventure and self-sacrifice may well have appealed to youthful idealism.  \n \n  As we would expect, A Door is steeped throughout in biblical imagery, buttressed with \ndirect citations. Revelation dominates the main text, as well as the appendix, with \nfourteen citations. All but two of the other twenty citations are from the Old Testament, \ndrawn mainly from Psalms and Jeremiah, lamenting the sins and sufferings of God\u2019s \npeople while holding out the promise of certain deliverance. There was comfort too in \nIsa. 59:19, quoted on the opening page, which tells how God will allow the enemy to \n\u201ccome in like a flood\u201d. The audience would not need to be reminded how the verse goes \non to promise that \u201cthe Lord shall lift up a standard against him\u201d. That text, echoed in Isa. \n62:10, had inspired the manifesto of the 1657 rising, A Standard Set Up, and inspired A \nDoor itself, which carries the sub-title A Call and Declaration for the gathering together \nof the first ripe Fruits unto the Standard of our Lord King Jesus. Nor would the audience \nneed to be given a scriptural reference for the familiar millenarian promise (from Psalm \n149) that the saints would soon be given the power to \u201cbinde their Kings in Chains, and \ntheir Nobles in Fetters of Iron\u201d (4).   \n 20\n \n   The final section of A Door, in effect a \u201cscholarly\u201d appendix, is markedly different in \nstyle. It offers a relatively sober exposition of the prophecy of the two witnesses in Rev. \n11, identified as true Christians down the ages who have remained faithful unto death, \nand now lie dead (for three and a half days) until their resurrection. The object is to prove \nthis resurrection imminent. The prophecy is linked to other prophecies of persecution, \nnotably the 1290 days in Dan. 12:11, and 1260 days or 42 months of Rev.11. Drawing on \nthe biblical scholarship of Mede, Tillinghast and Clavis Apocalyptica, the author \nconcludes that these prophetic times elapsed in 1656; which, by adding the three and a \nhalf days (or years) of the witnesses lying dead, \u201cbrings us to this very year 1660\u201d (14). \n(In the seventeenth-century calendar the new year began on 25 March, and Venner\u2019s \nrising therefore took place in 1660.) Evidence is then adduced to substantiate this \ninterpretation. For three of the three and a half years an outwardly pious power would \nrestrain the Beast from his savage blood-lust, \u201ca moderate civil kinde of People, \npretending to Reformation in matters of State\u201d. These people would then be swept aside \nas their old conquered enemies triumphed once more, unleashing a new age of \npersecution. The former party were easily identified as the Cromwellians, the latter as \n\u201cthe old carnall, Cavalier Popish Party\u201d who had returned \u201cto over-throw our \nReformation again with Popery, Prelacy and Superstition\u201d. But their time will be short: \n\u201cFor it seems to us, that the Cavaliers from their first coming in, have but about six \nmoneths time\u201d (14). The analysis then considers the role of Cromwell. Down the \ncenturies, from the time of the Emperor Julian, persecutors had destroyed the bodies of \ntrue believers, but their spirits had remained unbroken. By contrast, Cromwell\u2019s cunning \n 21\nhad killed the witnesses \u201ccivilly and spiritually\u201d, a far more terrible death, by frustrating \ntheir \u201cFinishing-Testimony\u201d, explained as the attempt to proclaim and establish the \nkingdom of Christ on earth (15-16). These lines were probably penned late in 1660, with \nthe writer perhaps counting the three and a half years of the witnesses\u2019 death from April \n1657, the date of the Fifth Monarchists\u2019 first abortive uprising. While contemporaries \nwould have ridiculed any notion of the Swan Alley congregation being foreshadowed in \nscripture, the writer insisted that Cromwell himself had been disconcerted by the \npossibility: \n \nabout a year and a half before his death [i.e. about April 1657], this Prophecy of \nthe Witnesses seemed to trouble him very much; and he was very earnest with \ntwo of us, to know what we thought of the Witnesses, the which he seemed to \nspeak with a convinced guilty minde, and some kinde of regret (16). \n \nCromwell had indeed interrogated the leading conspirators in April 1657 and, though we \ncan dismiss his alleged feelings of guilt, he shared the Fifth Monarchists\u2019 longing to \ndecipher God\u2019s providence and his own \u201cgeneration-work\u201d.31 The prisoners may well \nhave discerned a certain ruefulness as he compared his uncertainty with their own \nsublime self-confidence. \n \n   A Door ends by insisting that the biblical prophecies must refer to England, \u2018the very \nStage of Action\u2019 in the world over the preceding twenty years. It noted that even foreign \nwriters had recognised that the unparalleled upheavals foreshadowed the approaching \n 22\nend, a claim supported by references to Clavis Apocalyptica and Menassah ben Israel\u2019s \nThe Hope of Israel (1652). Menassah had appealed to Parliament, and later to Cromwell, \nto re-admit Jews to England, a proposal of great interest to the Fifth Monarchists (as to \nCromwell), for the conversion of the Jews was widely regarded as another of the signs \nheralding the apocalypse, and re-admission might well pave the way. England was thus at \nthe very crux of unfolding European events. If an equally strong case could be advanced \nfor Germany, A Door graciously conceded, \u201cthen we will consider further\u201d. But the signs \npointed clearly to England, and \u201cIn all probability, the great Day of the Witnesses Rise, \nwill be in this present Year, 1660. AMEN\u201d (16).32\n \n   It appears rather surprising now to find this relatively measured and dispassionate piece \nof biblical exegesis attached to a fiery, sometimes almost hysterical call to arms. The \nauthor is at pains throughout to stress how frequently his interpretations follow those of \neminent scholars, \u201cworthy famous men\u201d such as Mede, Tillinghast, the \u2018German Author\u201d \n[of Clavis], \u201cand other Authors of no small authority\u201d (12). The textual analysis is \npunctuated by repeated references to such authorities: \u201cso Mede\u201d, \u201cso Tilling.\u201d, \u201cM. \nTillinghasts very words\u201d (13-14). The whole analysis is \u201cHumbly submitted to Saints \nConsideration\u201d, and its final conclusions \u201cwe leave to sober and judicious men to judge\u201d \n(12, 16). In the wake of the Restoration, the Fifth Monarchists had to contend with a \ngeneral conviction among radicals that God had turned his back on them, and that \nmillenarian optimism had been sadly misplaced. As the manifesto\u2019s title suggests, they \nwere seeking to open a door that most regarded as firmly shut. To convince the Fifth \nMonarchists themselves, and still more to draw in outsiders, it was essential to \n 23\ndemonstrate that the rebels\u2019 readings of both providence and scripture were well founded. \nThe discussions between Fifth Monarchists and other anti-Cromwellian dissidents in \n1656 had similarly included a consideration of both issues. On that occasion Venner\u2019s \ngroup had failed to convince even other Fifth Monarchist groups; some had judged them \ntoo rash, eager for violence without clear biblical sanction and hence doomed to \ndestruction.33 \u201cSome choice Teachings\u201d thus sought to convince the godly reader that the \nFifth Monarchists\u2019 militant zeal rested on a sober analysis of scripture, supported by \nreputable scholars. Even the main text of A Door, for all its fierce rhetoric, repeatedly \ninsisted on the reasonableness of its arguments. Religious radicals generally preferred the \nguidance of the spirit and scripture to mere human reason, and A Door at one point \nacknowledged that the godly \u201cgo a step above depraved reason, and common \nunderstanding\u201d (4). But the author also insists that his argument is \u201cvery rational\u201d, cites \nthe \u201cLaw of Nature and Nations\u201d as well as scripture, and is at pains to correct popular \nmisconceptions about the kingdom of Christ, \u201cnot in scripture and reason, \u2026 as that \nChrist should immediately appear to head an Army\u201d (4, 6-8). \n \n   We do not know how widely A Door was disseminated in the few days between the \nrising and its suppression. The bookseller and collector George Thomason managed to \nacquire a copy (undated), the only one now known to survive.34  Several pamphleteers \nrushed to give a narrative of the rising, and two set out to answer A Door itself. Hell \nbroke loose (1661) reprints the first eleven pages of A Door in their entirety, rebutting its \nclaims paragraph by paragraph, and The Phanatiques Creed, or a Door of Safety (dated \n15 January1661) also reprints substantial sections. Both authors probably assumed that \n 24\nmost readers who had heard of and perhaps even witnessed the rising would not have \nseen its manifesto. Reprinting the text risked giving the rebels new publicity, but also \noffered a perfect opportunity to smear any opposition to the new regime with the taint of \nfanaticism. Hell broke loose indeed concludes with satisfaction that the rising, and its \nmanifesto, must spell the total ruin of \u201cthat vain Idol, the GOOD OLD CAUSE\u201d.35 Both \nauthors met the claims of A Door with expressions of horror, outrage, and contempt \nrather than engaging in detail with its arguments. It was \u2018Time Lost to oppose Argument \nagainst pretended Revelation\u201d, one remarked, ignoring the fact that A Door was based on \nscriptural exegesis, however contentious. In any case, the prophecies of Daniel and \nRevelation, and the Number of the Beast, were brushed aside as no more than \u2018Tedious \nFooleries\u2019.36 A Door\u2019s author was condemned as a rebel, traitor and ignorant fanatic. He \nwas both a dangerous new John of Leyden and an absurd fantasist, a  \u201cbrave Knight of \nthe Oracle\u201d aping St. George in a crazed mission to rescue the \u201cHoly Sisters\u201d from an \nimagined dragon.37 At the same time, it was deemed necessary to reassure any doubtful \nreaders that Charles II and his bishops could be trusted to protect the Protestant faith \nfrom the threat of popery. The Phanatiques Creed also suggested strict new controls on \npreaching and the press, and the imposition of strict oaths on dissenters that would see \ndefaulters banished twenty miles from the capital.38  \n    \n   In the immediate wake of the rising thousands of Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers \nand republicans were rounded up and imprisoned by a badly shaken government. \nCongregationalist and Baptist leaders published hasty repudiations of Venner\u2019s action, \nwhile the rising prompted the Quakers to formalise what became known as their \u201cpeace \n 25\nprinciple\u201d, a rejection of all force and violence.39 But plotting continued, and it should \nnot surprise us that the overlapping religious and secular strands of interregnum \nradicalism became ever more closely entwined. They had been far apart in 1653, when \nCromwell, spurred on by the Fifth Monarchists and their champion Major-General \nHarrison, had overthrown the Rump and established a \u201cParliament of Saints\u201d. Under the \nProtectorate, by contrast, republicans and Fifth Monarchists had shared an embittered \nopposition to the new regime, and they had drawn much closer in 1659 in seeking to \nrevive the \u201cGood Old Cause\u201d. Moreover, while proclaiming the rule of the saints, the \nFifth Monarchists had always balanced their theocratic fervour with a vision of social \nharmony and justice once that kingdom was established.  A Door of Hope reflects the \nlinks as well as the contrasts between the Fifth Monarchist and other radical visions. In \nthe years after 1661 most Fifth Monarchists were gradually reabsorbed among the \npeaceful Baptists and Congregationalists. But others, including Venner\u2019s son Thomas and \nson-in-law Medley, both of whom survived the rising, found a place within the political \nopposition and lived long enough to throw in their lot with Shaftesbury, Monmouth and \nWilliam of Orange.40 While such links offer us a glimpse of radical continuities, they \nunderline too how completely the political and religious world had been transformed \nsince the door of hope was slammed in 1661. \n \nNotes \n \n1.
