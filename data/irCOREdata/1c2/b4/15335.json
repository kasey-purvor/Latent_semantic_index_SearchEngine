Many of these \ninitiatives took time to introduce and become established.  Beginning in 2001, and \neach year thereafter until 2008, the authors collected consistent data from thousands \nof children when they started school at the age of four on a range of variables, chosen \nbecause they are good predictors of later success.  These included vocabulary, early \nreading and early mathematics. Children from the same set of four hundred and \nseventy two state primary schools in England were assessed each year.  This paper \ncontributes to the existing studies of educational trends over time by examining the \nextent to which children\u201fs scores on these measures changed over that period; in \ngeneral, they were found to have remained stable. \n \n 4 \nIntroduction \nSince 1997, the English government has introduced several national and local \ninitiatives intended to enhance the lives of children in England and to reduce the \nimpact of poverty and social deprivation.  Good quality childcare and education in the \nearly years have been a high national priority and education in the early years was one \nof the main provisions of the 2002 Education Act (HM Government, 2002).  Many of \nthe initiatives have not only sought to improve the teaching and learning of young \nchildren but also to support the needs of the whole family by providing integrated \nservices such as pre-school care in the same location as adult education and health \nfacilities. \n \nThe Act introduced the Foundation Stage of the National Curriculum for children \nfrom the age of 3 to the end of the first year at school at the age of 5 (Statutory \nInstrument, 2003a).  Prior to that time, although state and private pre-school provision \ndid exist, and most children attended a full year at school at the age of four, there was \nno requirement to follow a common curriculum.  The Foundation Stage has specific \ncurriculum guidance across six areas of learning\n1\n and a statutory assessment, the \nFoundation Stage Profile, which uses practitioners\u201f observations to assess each child's \nattainment at the end of the Stage (Statutory Instrument, 2003b).  In September 2008, \nthe statutory assessment arrangements for the Early Years Foundation Stage were \nchanged and although the Foundation Stage Profile remained in place, the way in \nwhich the scales were assessed consisted largely of practitioner observations of child \ninitiated activities (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, 2008).  From April \n                                                 \n1\n The six areas of learning are: 1) Personal, Social and Emotional Development, 2) Communication, \nLanguage and Literacy, 3) Mathematical Development, 4) Knowledge and Understanding of the \nWorld, 5) Physical Development, 6) Creative Development. \n 5 \n2004, all children in England were entitled to a free part-time early education place \nwhen they were three years old although they are not legally required to start \nattending school until the start of the term after their fifth birthday\n2\n. In practice 95% \nof children aged 3 and 4 in England accessed some free early education, some run by \nlocal authorities, others by voluntary and private sectors (Department for Children, \nSchools and Families (DCSF), 2009).  It can be part-time (the free place offered by \nthe government consists of a minimum of five sessions of two and a half hours\u201f early \nyears education per week for 33 weeks per year), full-time or, for parents in full-time \nemployment, care that extends beyond the school-day. \n \nSome Early Years initiatives have had a wider scope.  For example, \u201eSure Start\u201f is an \nongoing, widely implemented initiative supported by the Government that aims to \nachieve better outcomes for children, parents and communities (Sure Start, 2007).  \nThe focus of many initiatives has been on children in deprived circumstances because \nit is well known that socio-economic status is related to academic achievement (see \nfor example Bourdieu and Passeron, 1977; Raffo,  Dyson, Gunter, Hall, Jones and \nKalambouka, 2007) and evidence from previous studies, particularly the Head Start \nand the Perry Pre-School programmes in the United States of America, have \ndemonstrated that comprehensive early years interventions can make a difference to \nchildren's lives and help to reduce the link to deprivation (Barnett, 1995; Karoly, \nGreenwood, Everingham, Hoube, Kilburn, Rydell, Sanders and Chiesa, 1998; Ramey \nand Campbell, 1991; Reynolds, Temple, Robertson and Mann, 2001; Schweinhart, \nBarnes and Weikhart, 1993; Schweinhart, 1996; Schweinhart and Weikart, 1997).  \nThe evidence (Schweinhart et al., 1993 and 1996) suggests that when the recipients of \n                                                 \n2\n The small proportion who are home educated do not have to attend school. \n 6 \nthe Perry Pre-School intervention reached adulthood they had higher earnings, \nengaged in less criminal behaviour, completed more years of education and were \nmore likely to own their home than those children randomly assigned to the control \ngroups.  Gilliam and Zigler (2000) conducted a meta-analysis of all evaluations of \nU.S. state-funded pre-school from 1977 \u2013 1998.  The pattern of overall findings from \nthe analysis offered modest support for positive impacts in improving children\u201fs \ndevelopment, improving later school attendance and performance, and reducing \nsubsequent grade retention. Significant impacts were mostly limited to kindergarten \nand first grade; however, some were sustained several years beyond this period.  \n \nThe evidence from programmes implemented and evaluated in the U.S.A. and the \nEffective Pre-School and Primary Education (EPPE) 3-11 cohort study conducted in \nEngland was considered in the development of Sure Start, which is predominantly \naimed at deprived neighbourhoods (Melhuish, 2007a; Melhuish, 2007b; Taggart, \nSylva, Melhuish, Siraj-Blatchford and Sammons, 2007).  The Sure Start initiative in \nEngland was delivered through local programmes, each intended to be tailored to the \ncontext and needs of different areas.  These Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs), \nwhich were set up to improve the well-being, attainments and life chances of all \nchildren from birth to four years old in each area and to support their families, offered \na wide variety of services and facilities.  The first round of sixty SSLPs was set up in \n1999, working to bring together early education, childcare, health and family support \nfor the benefit of children in disadvantaged areas. By 2004, there were five hundred \nand twenty four SSLPs established aimed at helping almost half a million children \nliving in disadvantaged areas.  Most of the communities in these 524 SSLPs have a \nChildren\u201fs Centre, and it is the aim of the government to establish a Children\u201fs Centre \n 7 \nin every community by the year 2010. Children\u201fs Centres are places where children \nunder 5 years of age and their families can receive integrated education, care, family \nsupport, health services and support with employment (Sure Start, 2008).  It is too \nsoon to be able to comment on the long-term impact of these initiatives; however \nsome evaluations have been completed (see for example Brooks, Cole, Hines, Lewis, \nOhn, Pollock, Ritchie and Vincent, 2003; Anning and the National Evaluation of Sure \nStart, 2007; The National Evaluation of Sure Start Team, 2008).  The Sure Start \nnational evaluation team found variation in the implementation of SSLPs but found \npositive impacts on a range of factors. For example, the parents of three-year-old \nchildren showed less negative parenting while providing their children with a better \nhome learning environment. Three-year-old children in SSLP areas had better social \ndevelopment with higher levels of positive social behaviour and independence\/self-\nregulation than children in similar areas not having a SSLP. \nThere has been some criticism of SSLPs.  Rutter (2007) acknowledged that the \ngovernment\u201fs desire to improve outcomes for children growing up in England was to \nbe commended, and that there was research evidence for the effectiveness of pre-\nschool programmes, but he criticised the implementation of programmes within \nSSLPs and their evaluation.  He argued that SSLPs differed from initiatives \npreviously evaluated in several key respects.  For example, each SSLP was left to \ndecide what it wanted to change and how it was going to implement those changes. \nThere was a lack of specification in how goals should be met and what sort of \ncurriculum should be provided.  There was very little piloting of programmes prior to \nlarge-scale implementation.  With respect to the evaluation of the impact of the \nSSLPs, Rutter identified several limitations, including their diversity and the lack of \nrandom assignment of individuals or areas to different programmes. Raffo et al. \n 8 \n(2007) have also criticised Sure Start and other recent initiatives, saying that \u201cThese \ninterventions have been undertaken in a piecemeal fashion and so far have had only a \nvery partial impact in breaking the link between poverty and poor educational \nattainment.\u201d \n \nAnother large scale English Government initiative within the last ten years has been \nthe establishment of Education Action Zones (EAZs) aimed at raising educational \nstandards in disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  These were local partnerships \nbetween groups of schools (both primary and secondary, in groups of not more than \n20), businesses, parents and local authorities. EAZs usually ran for three years, with \nthe possibility of extended funding for a further two years.  In addition to the focus on \nschools, these zones received preferential treatment on funding to set up nurseries.  \nThe first group of 12 EAZs was set up in 1998, with a second round of 13 more \nintroduced in 1999. The end total was 73 zones serving 1,444 schools covering \napproximately 6% of the school population of England.  Some of these EAZ \nprogrammes included interventions for pre-school and school children.  An evaluation \nof the second round of EAZs by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED, \n2003) reported variable findings. Amongst the conclusions, it reported that \u201cAlthough \nsome success was evident, overall, the headway made by zones, and the schools in \nthem, was too variable. In the majority of zones there was not enough deliberate and \nsustained attention to tackling difficult common issues\u201d (Page 39). \n \nIn 2003, the Government published a green paper called Every Child Matters, which \nprompted a debate about services for children, young people and families.  Following \nthe consultation, the Government published Every Child Matters: the Next Steps, and \n 9 \npassed the Children Act 2004, providing legislation to support the development of \nintegrated services to meet  the needs of children from birth to age nineteen years.  \nTheir aim was to provide facilities for every child, whatever their background or \ncircumstances, to have the support they need to be healthy, stay safe, enjoy and \nachieve, make a positive contribution, and achieve economic wellbeing.  Like Sure \nStart, this initiative involved providers of education, social and health services \nworking together to provide an integrated service. \n \nOther smaller-scale initiatives are too numerous to mention. \n \nThis paper aims to investigate the extent to which children\u201fs cognitive development \non entry to school changed over the latter part of this period. Monitoring \nimprovements over time requires reliable assessment data, whose content remains \nunchanged, collected on a wide scale over an extended period.  The statutory \nFoundation Stage Profile cannot be used for this purpose because it was not \nintroduced until 2003, it has changed since that date and is based on teacher \njudgement. On the other hand, the Performance Indicators in Primary Schools (PIPS) \nOn-entry Baseline Assessment (BLA) collects very reliable objective data which has \nwell-established predictive validity and has remained unchanged for several years \n(CEM Centre 1999; Tymms, Merrell and Henderson, 2000). This paper reports the \nresults of the PIPS BLA in England over the period of 2001 to 2008 inclusive for the \nsame four hundred and seventy two primary schools against a range of background \nvariables collected at pupil level. A dataset of this size and consistency over time is \nrare, particularly of children\u201fs cognitive development at the start of school, and as \nsuch adds to the existing studies of trends over time. \n 10 \nMeasures and Sample \n \nThe PIPS project is one of several projects run from the Centre for Evaluation and \nMeasurement (CEM) at Durham University (CEM, 2009), which provides schools \nwith monitoring systems for children aged three to eighteen years.  Schools (and \nsometimes whole districts) choose to opt into the systems and pay an annual \nsubscription for their use. More than one million children each year are assessed.  \nCEM provides the assessments and then marks and analyses the data for schools, and \nfeeds back standardised scores for the attainment, attitudes and progress of their \npupils.  As a result, CEM holds large datasets that can be further analysed for research \npurposes such as this paper. \n \nThe PIPS BLA was developed by CEM and is administered within the first six weeks \nof a child starting compulsory education on an individual basis, taking approximately \ntwenty minutes per child.  It is a computer-delivered assessment whose content is \nbased on areas of children\u201fs development which have been shown to be the best \npredictors of later success or difficulty at school (Tymms, 1999).  It includes sections \nof vocabulary, early reading, and early mathematics, specifically: \n Picture Vocabulary \u2013 the child is asked to identify objects embedded within a \npicture showing a familiar scene. \n Ideas about reading \u2013 assesses concepts about print such as pointing to the \nstart of a sentence. \n Letter identification \u2013 a fixed order of mixed upper and lower case letters. \n Word recognition and reading \u2013 this begins with multiple choice word \nrecognition and moves on to children reading simple sentences aloud, and \n 11 \nfinally on to children reading a text in which approximately every fifth word is \na choice of three and the child has to select the correct one. \n Ideas about mathematics \u2013 assessment of understanding of the vocabulary  \nassociated with mathematical concepts such as \u201ebiggest\u201f and \u201esmallest\u201f. \n Counting and Numerosity \u2013 the child is asked to count four objects.  These  \ndisappear from the screen and then the child is asked how many objects they \nsaw.  This is repeated with seven objects. \n Sums \u2013 addition and subtraction problems presented without symbols. \n Shape identification. \n Digit identification \u2013 single, two-digits and three-digits. \n Maths problems \u2013 including sums with symbols. \nThe teacher works with individual pupils and the computer program presents the child \nwith questions (orally). Depending on the type of question, the child responds either \nby pointing to the answer from the choice of options on the screen, or by saying the \nanswer.  The teacher records the child\u201fs response on-screen and the program selects \nthe next question. \nThe assessment has high test\/re-test reliability (0.98) and internal reliability (0.94), \nand good predictive validity, for example the correlations between the PIPS BLA and \nreading and maths at age 7 were 0.70 and 0.65 respectively (Tymms, Merrell and \nHenderson, 2000). \nThe sample consisted of four hundred and seventy two state primary schools in \nEngland that carried out the PIPS BLA with all of their children entering school in \nSeptember every year from 2001 to 2008 inclusive.  A large number of schools opt in \nto use the PIPS BLA each year but it is their choice of whether or not to continue \nyear-after-year and so the sample varies over time as some schools leave the system, \n 12 \neither permanently or temporarily, and other schools join.  The sample analysed for \nthis paper was the total number of schools that had consistently used the PIPS BLA \nevery year during the period in question.  Prior to 2001, the content of the assessment \ndiffered slightly and so it was decided not to include data from before that year. The \nschools were self-selected and the extent to which they are representative of England \nas a whole is discussed in the next section. \n \nThe number of pupils assessed each year is shown in Table 1. \n \nInsert Table 1 here \n \nAdditional information on the pupils\u201f date of birth, sex, special needs and first \nlanguage was recorded.  Information was not collected about any specific initiatives \n(for example a Sure Start Local Programme) that pupils had been involved with prior \nto starting school. \nResults \nChanges in Background Variables \n \nFirstly, the representativeness and stability of the proportion of pupils with English as \nan Additional Language (EAL), the sex of the pupils and the mean age at test were \ninvestigated.  Comparing these variables to national norms gives an indication of the \nrepresentativeness of the sample. If these characteristics changed a large amount over \nthe period of investigation, they should be considered when interpreting the trends \nfound in the PIPS BLA scores over time. Table 2 shows the percentage of EAL and \nboys, and the mean age of the pupils when they were assessed each year. \n 13 \n \nInsert Table 2 here \n \n \nThere was no significant difference in the percentage of males each year. A Chi \nSquare test showed that the proportion of children with EAL varied over time to a \nstatistically significant degree. It increased each year between 2001 and 2006 but then \ndecreased in the following two years. The mean age at test also appeared to be stable \nbut did in fact differ to a statistically significant extent (p = 0.03) over time. It varied \nbetween 4.56 and 4.66 years. \n \nNationally, the percentage of children with English as an Additional Language in \nEnglish primary schools was 11.5% in 2005, 12.5% in 2006 (DfES, 2006) and 13.5% \nin 2007 (DCSF, 2007).  The percentage of pupils for whom English was an additional \nlanguage in the samples analysed in this paper increased over time as national trends \ndid, but was higher than the national figures for 2005, 2006 and 2007. It should be \nnoted it was an optional part of the assessment for schools to supply information \nabout EAL and so therefore there was some missing data, as specified below Table 2. \n \nAttainment on entry to school was compared to the national average to give another \nangle on the representativeness of the sample.  The early reading, picture vocabulary \nand early maths PIPS scores from the total number of participating schools are \nstandardised annually. These attainment scores are expressed as T scores with a mean \nof 50 and standard deviation of 10.  The whole sample is checked each year to ensure \nthat they are nationally representative by analysing school size, deprivation levels and \nstatutory assessment outcomes therefore the national average was 50 with a standard \ndeviation of 10.  . As explained earlier, not all participating schools were included \n 14 \nwithin this study; just those who had used PIPS every year over the period in \nquestion. The mean PIPS BLA total scores of the sample of schools selected for \ninclusion in this study were consistently significantly lower than the national average. \nThese are reported in Table 3. \n \nInsert Table 3 here. \n \nIn summary, the schools in the sample for this study had a higher proportion of \nchildren with English as an additional language, and had lower on-entry baseline \nscores than the national average.  \n \nChanges in PIPS BLA Scores over Time \n \nWhen looking at changes over time, it is necessary to look at changes in raw scores \nbecause yearly standardisations may introduce variation. Table 4 shows the mean raw \nscores and standard deviations from the PIPS BLA for early reading, picture \nvocabulary, early mathematics and the total each year between 2001 and 2008 \ninclusive. \n \nInsert Table 4 Here \n \nLooking at Table 4, the picture vocabulary and early reading mean scores were \ngenerally stable but in 2008 they were actually lower than when the data collection \nbegan in 2001.  The early maths mean scores were higher in 2008 than when data \ncollection began in 2001. One-way Analysis of Variance indicated statistically \n 15 \nsignificant differences (p<.05) over time for the three separate areas and the total \nscore although in educational terms, the differences were very small. The smallest \ndifference between two time points was for picture vocabulary, which amounted to an \nEffect Size of -0.07. The largest difference was for early maths, which amounted to an \nEffect Size of 0.11. It is concluded that children\u201fs scores at the start of school were \ngenerally stable over the period investigated prior to controlling for background \nvariables and that although the changes were statistically significant, they were too \nsmall to be educationally significant. \nMain Effects and Interactions \n \nGeneral Linear Models were used to analyse changes in the PIPS BLA scores over \ntime in relation to Year\n3\n, EAL and sex. Age at test was entered as a covariate.  All \ntwo-way interactions were considered.  Tables 5, 6, and 7 show the results for early \nreading, early maths and picture vocabulary respectively. \n \nInsert Tables 5-7 here \n \nYear was statistically significant for all outcomes. That is, after controlling for age at \ntest, there were significant differences over time. Children for whom English was an \nadditional language had significantly lower scores than children with English as their \nmother tongue for all outcomes. \n \n \n                                                 \n3\n Year is used to refer to the academic year. \n 16 \nSummary and Discussion \n \nThis paper has presented data on the abilities of children starting compulsory \neducation in England between the years 2001 and 2008 inclusive. The measures are \ngood indicators of later success in reading and mathematics. The sample comprised a \ngroup of four hundred and seventy two primary schools that had carried out the same \nbaseline assessment over the period in question. Nearly 118,000 children were \nassessed. The total baseline score was consistently significantly lower than the \nnational average each year. The analysis of background variables showed that the \npercentage of children for whom English was an additional language was higher than \nthe national average and increased each year, as it did nationally. The proportion of \nboys and girls, and the mean age at test remained stable over the period investigated. \n \nAnalysis of the data suggested that: \n The abilities of children showed a statistically significant decrease from 2001 \nto 2008 for early reading and picture vocabulary. However, the effect sizes of \nthe differences were small and probably not educationally significant. \n The early maths scores rose significantly in the period studied although again \nthe effect size was small and probably not educationally significant. \n \nWhy should the scores on the BLA have been so stable?  The introduction described \nsome of the major initiatives that had been implemented on a wide scale during the \nyears preceding and during the period of time investigated in this study. On the one \nhand one might expect that these initiatives would have resulted in measurable \nchanges, especially the introduction of a comprehensive early years curriculum for all \n 17 \nchildren attending pre-school educational settings. This would have been experienced \nby a high proportion of children in the sample after its introduction in 2003 and so \nchanges could have been observed from 2004 onwards.  We recognise that other areas \nof development such as children\u201fs personal, social and emotional development, motor \ndevelopment and creative development are important and these were outside the scope \nthe present study. It is possible that these changed over the period investigated. \n \nWe do know that influencing the development of young children through early \ninterventions is not easy. Whilst there are many positive examples of successful \ninterventions there are also many examples of less successful initiatives (see for \nexample Ramey and Ramey, 1998).  More recently, Driessen (2004) investigated the \nimpact of early childhood education and care in The Netherlands.  He found that over \nthe period 1996 \u2013 2000, there were no demonstrable effects of pre-school programmes \non the cognitive or non-cognitive competencies of elementary school children.  \nBelsky (2006) noted that \u201cwhatever formal evaluations of early interventions reveal \nabout what occurs developmentally when economically-disadvantaged children are \nprovided with very special experimental programmes, often established for research \npurposes, should not automatically be equated with what transpires when far different \npopulations of children experience community-based day care.\u201d  Zigler and Styfco \n(2006) also noted a reduction in the efficacy of interventions when they are expanded \nfrom being delivered by experts in an optimal environment to community-based \nprogrammes. \n \nWhilst there are limitations to the interpretations that can be made of the data \npresented in this paper, the analyses are important because they have investigated  \n 18 \nchildren\u201fs cognitive development at the start of school in England on a large scale and \nusing a consistent measure, which is extremely rare and adds to the large-scale studies \nof educational trends over time.  Whilst we stress that this study does not constitute a \nformal evaluation of the government\u201fs initiatives, it nevertheless provides a single \nbroad perspective on the changing profiles of children starting school in England \nduring a time of rapid change and the picture is one of stability so far as the cognitive \ndevelopmental levels in early reading, vocabulary and early maths of children starting \nschool are concerned. \n 19 \nReferences \n \nAnning, A. and the National Evaluation of Sure Start (2007).
