The inclusion of neutron configurations\nin the shell-model calculations results in an improved agreement between the experimental and calculated level\nenergies at medium and high spin. These results highlight the considerable contribution of neutron-core\nparticle-hole excitations across the N=50 shell gap to the level configurations. The overall agreement of the\nmeasured excited states with the shell-model predictions is indicative of the persistence of the N=50 shell gap\ndown to Z=32.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.70.024301 PACS number(s): 21.10.Re, 23.20.2g\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNeutron-rich nuclei close to shell gaps have recently at-\ntracted a particular interest triggered by a possible existence\nof anomalies into the shell structure [1]. Different from\nproton-rich systems, which are stabilized by the Coulomb\nbarrier, nuclei close to the neutron drip-line are weakly\nbound and therefore valence neutrons can be very extended\nspatially. Here, new features like neutron skins or halos have\nbeen predicted and major effects are expected due to the\npairing interaction and to the influence of the particle con-\ntinuum.\nNeutron-rich nuclei around the shell-model magic num-\nbers N=20 and 28 have exhibited properties inconsistent\nwith shell closure [2,3]. Such quenching of the classical shell\ngaps has also been further corroborated by Hartree-Fock-\nBogoliubov (HFB) calculations with SKP force [4] and by\nusing mass predictions from the infinite nuclear matter\nmodel [5]. Several experimental results have shown indica-\ntions of a quenching of the N=20 shell in neutron-rich iso-\ntopes. The disappearance of the N=20 shell gap, predicted\nby Hartree\u2013Fock calculations [6] and by numerous shell-\nmodel studies [7], has, as a consequence an increased collec-\ntivity and eventually the stabilization of deformation in light\nmass, semimagic nuclei. Similarly, it has been suggested, on\nthe basis of self-consistent mean field calculations, that the\nmajor N=28 shell gap disappears when approaching Z=16.\nHere the potential energy surfaces become very soft with\nclose lying shallow minima corresponding to different defor-\nmations. Experimentally, intermediate-energy Coulomb exci-\ntation measurements of the BsE2;0+\u21922+d values have\nshown evidence of collectivity for 44S and 46Ar [8,9]. Re-\ncently, in such nuclei indication of shape coexistence has\nbeen found by Azaiez et al. [10]. A possible shrinking of the\nshell-closure feature has also been suggested from the com-\nparison of the measured and calculated solar nuclear abun-\ndances for heavy elements. Network calculations for the so-\nlar isotopic abundances coming from the rapid neutron-\ncapture processes involved in the explosive stellar\nnucleosynthesis reproduce the three peaks observed at A\n<80, 130 and 195 if, for very neutron-rich nuclei, the magic\nneutron numbers are less pronounced than assumed from\nnuclear structure studies [11].\nThe N=50 shell gap has been predicted to be quenched\nalready at Z<32 by calculations using mass predictions from\nthe infinite nuclear matter model [5]. Experimental evidence\nfor setting up of collectivity was shown by Kratz et al. [12]\nin the N=49 80Ga from the decay of the r-process waiting-\npoint isotope 30\n80Zn50. Here the gross b-decay properties as\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 70, 024301 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/70(2)\/024301(10)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society70 024301-1\nwell as the quasiparticle structure have been interpreted as a\nclear indication of shape coexistence in 80Ga suggesting a\nrather rapid weakening of the shell strength far from b sta-\nbility around 78Ni. This conclusion somewhat contradicts the\nobservation by Daugas et al. [13] of an 8+ isomeric state in\n78ZnsN=48d with a deduced BsE2,8+\u21926+d value well repro-\nduced by large scale shell-model calculations.\nPredictions of various theoretical models for the N=50\nisotones also come to differing conclusions. Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013\nBogoliubov (HFB) calculations based on Gogny\u2019s two-body\neffective interaction [14] and shell-model calculations [13]\npredict a persistence of the shell closure for the N=50 nuclei\nclose to 78Ni. In contrast a more recent HFB calculation [15],\nin which pairing (with a density dependent particle-particle\ninteraction) is treated on the same footing as particle-hole\ninteractions, predicts a significant reduction of the shell gap.\nIn such calculations the two neutron separation energy at N\n=50 drops from 18 MeV for Sr sZ=38d (on the line of sta-\nbility) to 11 MeV for Ge sZ=32d and then below 8 MeV for\nNi sZ=28d.\nIn this paper we report on a study of the excited structures\nof some N=50 neutron-rich nuclei. New experimental infor-\nmation has been obtained on the Rb, Br, Se and Ge isotones.\nThe low- and medium-spin structures have been populated\nusing deep-inelastic reactions. The excited states observed in\ntheir decay have been compared with shell-model calcula-\ntions allowing neutron particle-hole excitations across the\nneutron core. The comparison between measured and calcu-\nlated excitation energies of the levels at different spin values\nis used here to investigate the microscopic configuration of\nsuch nuclear systems as well as to test the N=50 shell gap\nand its stability down to Z=32. Preliminary results from this\nwork, not overlapping with the ones presented here, have\nbeen reported in conference proceedings [16].\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nExcited states of the 37\n87Rb, 35\n85Br, 34\n84Se and 32\n82Ge nuclei have\nbeen populated using heavy-ion multi-nucleon transfer reac-\ntions and studied through g-ray spectroscopy in a \u201cthick tar-\nget\u201d measurement [17,18]. The combination of the Tandem-\nXTU and the superconducting LINAC ALPI accelerators at\nthe Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, Italy, was used to ac-\ncelerate a beam of 82Se ions at an energy of 460 MeV onto a\ntarget of 192Os. The target, isotopically enriched to 97.8%,\nwas of a thickness of 60 mg\/cm2, sufficient to stop all reac-\ntion fragments. The beam-target combination was chosen in\norder to maximize the production of the nuclei of interest\nassuming an N \/Z ratio equilibration in deep inelastic pro-\ncesses [18,19]. Our expectation therefore was that the distri-\nbution of projectile-like products would be shifted toward\nmore neutron-rich nuclei.\nTriple and higher fold g-g coincidences were acquired\nwith the 4p spectrometer GASP [20] consisting of 40\nCompton-suppressed, large-volume germanium detectors\nand of an inner BGO ball acting as a multiplicity filter and\ntotal-energy spectrometer. Events were collected on tape dur-\ning six days of beam time under the conditions that a mini-\nmum of three Compton-suppressed Ge detectors and two\nBGO elements from the multiplicity filter fired in coinci-\ndence. With a beam current of 2 particle nA, the event rate\nwas ,4 kHz and the singles rate in each germanium detector\n,2 kHz. With such a setup g rays from the deexciting,\ntarget-like and projectile-like fragments were detected. After\ngain matching for all the detectors, the coincidence data were\nsorted into fully symmetrized matrices and cubes for subse-\nquent off-line analysis. Since all recoiling fragments were\nstopped in the target, Doppler broadening prevented the ob-\nservation of transitions deexciting short-lived states and only\ng decays with lifetimes longer than the slowing-down time\nof the recoiling nuclei s,1 psd could be resolved. Thus, no\nDoppler correction was applied when sorting the data. Isoto-\npic assignments of new g rays were based on previously\nreported double-coincidence events. In cases where only one\nexcited state and therefore only the g ray depopulating it was\nknown, as for 85Br and 82Ge, g rays have been assigned\nbased on the cross-coincidence relationship with the binary\nproducts and according to the expected systematic behavior.\nDue to the large number of final nuclei produced in the re-\naction, the isotopic assignments for the observed g cascades\nin such cases have to be taken as tentative.\nThe spins and parities of the levels were deduced, where\npossible, from angular distribution ratios from oriented states\n(ADO) as well as from the decay branches. In order to obtain\nmultipolarity information for the emitted g rays, two asym-\nmetric coincidence matrices were constructed using the g\nrays detected at all angles (y axis) against those observed at\n34\u00b0 (or 146\u00b0) and 90\u00b0 (x axes), respectively. In these two\nmatrices, g-ray intensities in the projected spectrum on the y\naxis can be regarded as independent from the angular distri-\nbution effects of the emitted g rays. The anisotropies of the\nemitted g rays are reflected in the ADO ratios defined as\nRADOsgd= Igs34\u00b0 d \/ Igs90\u00b0 d. The g-ray intensities Igs34\u00b0 d and\nIgs90\u00b0 d can be extracted from the coincidence spectra using\na gating transition (on the y axis) of any multipolarity. In\nsuch an analysis stretched quadrupole\/dipole transitions\nshould have the ADO ratios larger\/smaller than unity (<1.4\nfor pure quadrupole and <0.8 for pure dipole). It should be\nnoted that uncertainties occur for the spin and parity assign-\nments on the basis of ADO ratio analysis; the stretched quad-\nrupole transitions cannot be distinguished from DI=0 dipole\ntransitions or certain E2\/M1 admixtures of DI=1 transitions.\nIn these cases, cross checks from crossover or parallel tran-\nsitions and their branching ratios provide supplementary ar-\nguments for spin and parity assignments. The measured\nspectroscopic data (g-ray energies, relative intensities, ADO\nratios where possible, and suggested spin assignments) are\nsummarized in Tables I\u2013IV for the four nuclei discussed in\nthis paper.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nFrom the analysis of single- and double-gated spectra,\npreviously unidentified g rays have been assigned to the N\n=50 isotones 3787Rb, 3585Br, 3484Se and 3382Ge. Due to the nature of\nthe binary reaction mechanism used to populate such nuclei,\nin all cases the cross g-ray coincidences (the g rays coming\nfrom the decay of the \u201ctarget-like\u201d fragments in coincidence\nY. H. ZHANG et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 70, 024301 (2004)\n024301-2\nwith those coming from the \u201cbeam-like\u201d reaction products)\nwere used to distinguish between the different reaction part-\nners. Examples of coincidence spectra for the nuclei of inter-\nest are presented in Figs. 1\u20133.\nA. 87Rb\nThe few previously reported excited states in 37\n87Rb come\nfrom a variety of experiments including particle transfer re-\nactions [21\u201324], b-decay experiments [25,26], sn ,n8d reac-\ntion [27], Coulomb excitation [28], inelastic proton [29] and\na-particle scattering [30] and a very recent sg ,g8d reaction\nstudy [31]. The Ip=9\/2+ state at 1578 keV excitation energy\nwas the level with the highest angular momentum known\nprior to our experiment. It is interpreted as the proton g9\/2\nsingle-particle state (see Fig. 4). In the present work, by us-\ning the coincidence relationship between the two g-ray tran-\nsitions of 1175.3 and 402.6 keV deexciting the 9\/2+ state to\nthe ground state, we have extended the level scheme of 87Rb\nto an excitation energy of E=6.8 MeV as shown in Fig. 4.\nThe assignments of Ip=5\/2\u2212 and 9\/2+ to the levels at 403\nand 1578 keV excitation energy come from previous studies\n[32] and are confirmed in our work. The level at 3409 keV\ndeexcites through a 1831.1 keV transition, observed in the\ndouble-gated spectrum in coincidence with the 1175.3 and\n402.6 keV g rays. An Ip=13\/2+ assignment is suggested in\nTABLE I.

This\nvalue, as well as the one obtained for the 1175.3 keV line, is\nsomewhat smaller with respect to the expected value for an\nE2 stretched transition s<1.4d. This is probably related to a\nreduction in alignment due to higher lying isomeric states. A\ndecay branch parallel to the 1831.1 keV transition is ob-\nserved in the double-gated spectrum in coincidence with the\n402.6 and 1175.3 keV g rays. This identifies a level at\n3001 keV which, on the basis of systematics, is assigned as\nIp= s11\/2+d. A 235.0 keV g-ray transition deexcites a level at\n3644 keV to the 13\/2+ state. The corresponding ADO value\nclearly indicates a mixing, with a negative d, suggesting an\nM1 multipolarity for the 235.0 keV transition and therefore a\n15\/2s+d assignment for the 3644 keV level. The ADO values\nobtained for the 704.4, 171.7, and 454.5 keV g rays are all\ncompatible with the values expected for M1\/E2 transitions\nwith relatively strong mixing. The 506.6 keV line appears as\na pure dipole transition. Assignments of 17\/2s+d, 19\/2s+d,\n21\/2s+d and 23\/2s+d are proposed for the states at 4151, 4855,\n5027 and 5481 keV, respectively. The observed crossover\ntransitions of 876.0 and 1211.0 keV deexciting the 5027 and\nthe 4855 keV levels support such assignments. The two lev-\nels observed at 6566 and 6822 keV excitation energies are\ntoo weakly populated to allow us to extract the ADO values\nfor the two transitions which deexcite them to the 5481 keV\nstate. Accordingly, no spin and parity assignments can be\nproposed in the current work.\nB. 85Br\nIn the N=50, 3585Br nucleus only states with spins up to I\n=7\/2 were known in the literature, coming from b-decay\nFIG. 1.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 70, 024301 (2004)\n024301-4\nand direct-reaction studies [32]. Since the excitation energy\nof the 9\/2+ yrast state, expected below 2 MeV, was un-\nknown, the isotopic identification of the g cascades deexcit-\ning levels in 85Br could only be based on a single-gating\ncondition on the 345.2 keV 5\/2\u2212\u21923\/2\u2212 g transition. After a\ndetailed analysis of all g rays in coincidence, candidate tran-\nsitions were checked by setting double gastes on the\n345.2 keV 5\/2\u2212\u21923\/2\u2212 line of 3585Br and on the 258 keV,\n3\/2+\u21925\/2+ transition in the binary partner 189Re [32]. An\nessential ingredient in the isotopic determination was the use\nof triple g coincidences which allowed us to select each\n\u201cprojectile-like\u201d-target-like combination. Once a few g rays\nwere identified the level scheme was built up by setting\nmultiple-gate conditions. The final level scheme, reported in\nFig. 5, has been extended up to an excitation energy of\n4.343 MeV. Seven g rays have been placed above the\n345 keV 5\/2\u2212 level and ordered on the basis of the observed\nintensity relations. The state at an excitation energy of\n1573 keV, close to the expected value of the 9\/2+ excitation,\ndecays to the 345 keV, 5\/2\u2212 level via a 1227.3 keV g-ray\nline. The ADO result for this g-ray transition is compatible\nwith a DI=2 multipolarity (see Table II) thus supporting a\n9\/2+ assignment for the 1573 keV state. This level is fed by\na 1160.7 keV line deexciting the 2733 keV level. The ADO\nresult here is also compatible with a DI=2 multipolarity sup-\nporting a 13\/2+ assignment for this level. A decay branch\nparallel to the 1160.7 keV g-ray line is observed in the\ndouble-gated spectrum in coincidence with the 345.2 and\n1227.3 keV g rays. This identifies a new level at 2437 keV\nexcitation energy for which, as in the similar case of 87Rb, an\nIp= s11\/2+d assignment is preferred.\nThe ADO ratios for the 593.5 and 382.6 keV transitions\nare consistent with pure DI= I multipolarities. We prefer\n15\/2s+d and 17\/2s+d spin and parity assignments for the levels\nat 3327 and 3709 keV in analogy to the corresponding levels\nin 87Rb. The level identified at 4343 keV in excitation energy\nwhich decays to the 3709 keV level via a 633.7 keV transi-\ntion is too weakly populated to extract an ADO value. The\ns19\/2+d assignment for this state, reported in Table II, is\nbased on systematics (see corresponding level in 87Rb).\nC. 84Se\nThe N=50 nuclide 3484Se has been studied prior to the\npresent work in b-decay [33] and st , pd [34,35] reactions.\nThe highest spin state reported to date is I=4.

For the level at 3537 keV in excita-\ntion energy a s5+d assignment is preferred based on the ADO\nvalue of the 164.7 keV g ray (typical of a DI=1 transition\nwith a large mixing and therefore of magnetic character) and\non the ADO result for the 1415.3 keV g ray (which is com-\npatible with an M1\/E2 mixed multipolarity). The low inten-\nsity of the 1249.0, 492, and 704.3 keV transitions did not\nallow us to extract ADO values. Therefore the spin and par-\nity assignment for the 4406 keV level suggested here is\nbased on systematics having as a reference the N=50 86Kr\nnucleus [32].\nD. 82Ge\nThe only information available concerning 32\n82Ge comes\nfrom b-decay studies [36] and is limited to two levels with\nIp= s2+d. These spin assignments are based on b-decay rates\nand on the observation of a 2214 keV line deexciting the\ns22\n+d level to the ground state. Both levels are also observed\nin our experiment but the low intensity of the 866.2 and\n1347.6 keV transitions deexciting the s22\n+d to the s21\n+d and the\nlatter to the ground state did not allow us to extract the ADO\nvalues. Gating on both g lines a possible level at 3682 keV\nwas observed. In order to identify the higher-spin states of\n82Ge we have analyzed any g-ray transition observed in co-\nincidence with the 1347.6 keVs2+d\u21920+ transition. Any can-\ndidate g-ray transition was checked using double-gating con-\nditions for detecting coincident g rays. All the g cascades\nselected in this way were checked to ensure that they do not\nbelong to other nuclei. In order to verify our identification\nwe also used a cross-coincidence analysis with g rays from\nthe target-like partner. Two coincident g rays of 681.0 and\n1577.5 keV fulfilled all the required conditions, being in co-\nincidence with both the 1347.6 keV transition from 82Ge and\nthe 316.5 keV, 2+\u21920+ transition in the binary product s\n\u22122p+2nd 192Pt [32]. Two g rays with these energies are\nknown to be in mutual coincidence in the decay scheme of\n87Kr, but they do not decay through a 1348 keV g-ray tran-\nsition. Accordingly we tentatively propose the assignment of\nsuch a g lines to 82Ge (see Table IV ) but, due to the uncer-\ntainty related to the contaminant g lines, we prefer not to\ninclude them in the proposed level scheme shown in Fig. 7.\nDue to the low cross section for this reaction channel s\u22122p\n+2nd, which is estimated to be of the order of <10 mb, we\ncould not extract any multipolarity information. Therefore,\nthe spins and parities of the levels are assigned on the basis\nof systematics [32] (Fig. 7).\nIV. SHELL-MODEL CALCULATIONS\nShell-model calculations have been performed using the\nRITSSCHIL [37] code. Two sets of calculations have been car-\nried out, one allowing (SM2) particle-hole excitations across\nthe N=50 neutron core and the other (SM1) not. The shell-\nmodel space used includes the active proton orbitals\nps0f5\/2 ,1p3\/2 ,1p1\/2 ,0g9\/2d and neutron orbitals\nns1p1\/2 ,0g9\/2 ,1d5\/2d relative to a hypothetical 28\n66Ni38 core.\nSince an empirical set of effective interaction matrix ele-\nments for this model space is not available yet, various em-\npirical sets have been combined with values obtained using a\nmodified surface-delta interaction. Details of this last proce-\ndure are described in Refs. [38,39]. The effective interaction\nin the proton shells was taken from Ref. [40], where the\nresidual interaction and the single-particle energies of the\nproton orbitals were deduced from a least-squares fit to 170\nFIG. 6.

For the proton-neutron interac-\ntion between the ps1p1\/2 ,0g9\/2d and the ns1p1\/2 ,0g9\/2d orbit-\nals the data of Ref. [41] have been used. They were derived\nfrom an iterative fit to 95 experimental level energies of the\nN=48, 49 and 50 nuclei. The matrix elements of the neutron-\nneutron interaction of the ns1p1\/2 ,0g9\/2d orbitals have been\nassumed to be equal to the isospin T=1 component of the\nproton-neutron interaction given in Ref. [41]. For the\nsp0f5\/2 ,n0g9\/2d residual interaction, the matrix elements pro-\nposed in Ref. [24] have been used.\nThe single-particle energies relative to the 66Ni core were\nderived from the single-particle energies of the proton orbit-\nals given in Ref. [40] with respect to the doubly magic 28\n78Ni50\ncore and from the neutron single-hole energies of the\n1p1\/2 ,0g9\/2 orbitals [41]. The transformation of these single-\nparticle energies to those relative to the 66Ni core\nwas performed [42] on the basis of the effective residual\ninteractions given above. The obtained values, in MeV, are\ne0f5\/2\np\n=\u22129.106, e1p3\/2\np\n=\u22129.033, e1p1\/2\np\n=\u22124.715, e0g9\/2p =\n\u22120.346, e1p1\/2\nn\n=\u22127.834, e0g9\/2\nn\n=\u22126.749, e1d5\/2\nn\n=\u22124.144.\nTo make the calculation feasible, a truncation of the oc-\ncupation numbers was necessary. At most, three protons were\nallowed to occupy the 1p1\/2 ,0g9\/2 orbitals and no more than\none 0g9\/2 neutron was allowed to be excited to the 1d5\/2\norbital (SM2). In order to test the role of the g7\/2 orbit in the\ncalculation, in some cases, where the limited particle number\nhas allowed it, we have added it to the neutron configuration\nspace. The results obtained were practically uneffected by\nthe inclusion of such orbit as a consequence of the very small\noccupation factor.\nV. DISCUSSION\nWe report here on four N=50 isotones, namely 3787Rb, 3585Br,\n34\n84Se and 32\n82Ge. The study of how their excited structures\nevolve as a function of the proton number, performed\nthrough the comparison with shell-model predictions ob-\ntained assuming a closed N=50 core, can be taken as a test\nof the persistence (or not) of the neutron shell gap when\nmoving away from the line of b stability. Such a comparison\nshows the importance of the breakup of the neutron core\nthrough particle-hole excitations across a constant N=50\ngap, for the description of medium- and high-spin excitations\nsI<8d. It is worth mentioning here that a similar shell-model\nanalysis performed for the N=48 Se and Ge isotones (which\nwill be reported in a forthcoming publication [43]) results in\na reasonable reproduction of the excited energy levels in the\nabove-mentioned spin region without requiring a breaking of\nthe closed neutron-core (and is therefore insensitive to a pos-\nsible modification of the neutron shell gap). The fact that the\nshell-model description seems to reproduce the observed\nspectra can be considered as evidence for an adequate de-\nscription of the residual nucleon-nucleon interaction and of\nthe single-particle energies (shell gap), thus indicating a con-\ntinued stability of the N=50 shell gap in the vicinity of 2878Ni.\nA. Nucleus 87Rb\nA comparison of the experimental and calculated levels of\n37\n87Rb is shown in Fig. 8. Two calculations have been carried\nout. The first (SM1) has been performed using only a proton\nconfiguration space, the second (SM2) allowing excitations\nacross the N=50 neutron shell gap from the 0g9\/2 into the\n1d5\/2 orbits. The excitation energies of all experimentally\nknown levels up to spin Ip=17\/2+ are well reproduced using\nonly the proton configuration space (SM1). The 3\/2\u2212 ground\nstate and the 5\/2\u2212 first excited level show a structure con-\nsisting mainly of a single proton particle in the 1p3\/2 or a\nproton hole in the 0f5\/2, orbit, respectively. The next excita-\ntion requires a promotion of a proton particle into the 0g9\/2\nstate. Such a state will couple with the proton-core excita-\ntions giving rise to the positive-parity excitations up to the\n17\/2+ state at 4.1 MeV of excitation energy. All those energy\nvalues compare reasonably with the shell-model predictions\ncalculated using only the proton-configuration space. Above\n4.1 MeV the agreement between the experimental levels and\nthe shell-model calculations performed in the proton space\n(SM1) becomes rather poorer. It is likely that at this point\nparticle-hole excitations across the N=50 neutron core begin\nto be important. In fact, by comparing the measured values\nwith the excited levels calculated using both the proton and\nneutron spaces (SM2) the agreement between experimental\nand calculated energies above 4.1 MeV improves signifi-\ncantly (see SM2 in Fig. 8). A closer inspection of the wave\nfunctions involved shows that the dominant contributions to\nthe 19\/2+, 21\/2+ and 23\/2+ states at excitation energies of\n4855, 5027 and 5481 keV, respectively, result from coupling\nFIG. 8. Shell model calculation for 87Rb. The calculations are\nperformed using either a proton space (SM1) or allowing also\nparticle-hole excitations across the N=50 shell gap (SM2).

A similar structure has been suggested at high spin\nin Ref. [38] for the N=50 3686Kr nucleus. We note, however\nthat, even if the general agreement between observed and\ncalculated (SM2) level energies in this excitation energy re-\ngion is remarkable, the value obtained for the calculated ex-\ncitation energies of the yrast levels are somewhat too high.\nSuch disagreement perhaps indicates that part of the collec-\ntivity is still missing from the description. For the higher-\nlying states at 6566 and 6822 keV, definitive spin and parity\nassignments were not possible in the present experiment.\nThus, these states might be compared with calculated levels\nof either positive or negative parity.\nB. Nucleus 85Br\nThe comparison of the experimental and calculated levels\nfor 35\n85Br basically shows results similar to 37\n87Rb. Figure 9\nshows the experimental and calculated (using both the\nproton-SM1\u2013 and the proton-neutron\u2013SM2\u2013 configuration\nspaces) energy spectra for 85Br. Here also the 3\/2\u2212 ground\nstate and the 5\/2\u2212 first excited state show a structure based\non a proton hole in the 1p3\/2 or the 0f5\/2 orbit, respectively.\nInterestingly the 0g9\/2 proton excitation is found at an exci-\ntation energy of 1573 keV, only 5 keV lower than that of the\nsimilar state in 37\n87Rb. The excitation energies of the shell-\nmodel states above the 9\/2+ level calculated in the proton\nconfiguration space (SM1) are much too high compared to\nthe experimental ones. A better agreement is obtained when\nneutron excitations across the N=50 shell gap are allowed\n(SM2), even if the calculated energy spectrum is still too\nhigh with respect to the measured one. This indicates that\ncore breaking particle-hole components become important\nabove the 9\/2+ as shown by the lowering in excitation en-\nergy of the 11\/2+ or 19\/2+ states in SM2 with respect to\nSM1 as well as of the negative parity levels. Nevertheless,\nthe effect of such core-breaking excitations on the excitation\nenergies of the states seems here somewhat more limited\nwhen compared to 37\n87Rb.\nC. Nucleus 84Se\nIn the 34\n84Se nucleus most of the observed levels are rea-\nsonably reproduced within the proton configuration space\n(SM1 in Fig. 10) up to spin Ip=6+ at 3.7 MeV excitation\nenergy. The only exception is the 4+ state which is calculated\nto be too high in our parametrization; for this state the con-\nfiguration s0f5\/2\u22121 ,1p3\/21 d is predicted to be the main compo-\nnent. The 6+ state at 3702 keV is also reasonably reproduced\nwithin the proton space (SM1); the correct ordering of the 5+\nand 6+ levels is only reproduced in the (SM2) space indicat-\ning the presence of significant components containing the\nns0g9\/2\n\u22121\n,1d5\/2\n1 d configuration (see Fig. 10). As in the previous\nRb and Br cases, the presence of neutron-core excitations\nabove 3.7 MeV excitation energy is more clearly indicated\nby the drastic lowering in excitation energy, with respect to\nthe value calculated using only the proton space (SM1), of\nthe calculated Ip=7+ and 8+ states in the neutron space\n(SM2). The comparison between experimental and calcu-\nlated (SM2) levels shows a good general agreement even\nthough the 7+ state is predicted at somewhat too high an\nenergy, indicating that part of the collectivity is missing due\nto the restriction of the shell model basis.\nD. Nucleus 82Ge\nFigure 11 shows the comparison of experimental and cal-\nculated levels in 32\n82Ge. Due to the very limited experimental\ninformation only the low spin region can be discussed here.\nGood agreement is observed between the experimental level\nenergies and those calculated using only the proton space\n(SM1). The calculated excitation energies of the 2+ and 4+\nstates are basically unaffected by the inclusion of the\nFIG. 9. Shell model calculation for 85Br.

Shell stability at N=50\nFor all N=50 nuclei discussed above we have shown that\nin order to reasonably reproduce the excited levels above\nIp=17\/2+ and 6+ (for odd-even and even-even systems, re-\nspectively), it is necessary to introduce particle-hole excita-\ntions across the N=50 gap. The size of the gap (about 4 MeV\nfor 78Ni) has been kept constant in the calculations. The gen-\neral agreement observed between the measured and calcu-\nlated excitation energies of the levels (see Figs. 8\u201311) can\ntherefore be considered to be a strong indication that, when\nmoving away from the stability line down to Z=32, the N\n=50 gap remains constant. The deviations observed between\nthe calculated and the experimental values at high spin can\nbe attributed to the limited collectivity available in our re-\nstricted particle space. In particular, the pairing excitations\nacross the N=50 shell are only partially accounted for by the\nmonopole part of the shell model interaction. The increase in\nsuch deviations when reducing the proton number supports\nsuch an interpretation.\nF. Summary\nThis paper presents the results of an in-beam study of\nmedium- and high-spin states in the N=50, 3787Rb, 3585Br, 3484Se\nand 32\n82Ge nuclei populated through the reaction 82Se+ 192Os at\n460 MeV beam energy. In all these nuclei we could extend\nthe level scheme up to higher spin and excitation energy. The\ncomparison with shell-model calculations has enabled us to\ntest the contribution in the nuclear wave functions of the\nneutron excitations across the N=50 core. The calculations\nhave shown that at least one-particle-one-hole excitations\nhave to be included in the configuration space to get a rea-\nsonable description of the excited, positive-parity levels\nabove spin I=17\/2\" in 37\n87Rb and 35\n85Br and spin I=4\" in 34\n84Se\nand 32\n82Ge. Due to the neutron particle-hole contribution to the\nconfigurations, the excitation energies of the higher-lying\nstructures are sensitive to the value of the neutron shell gap.\nThe generally good agreement obtained between calculated\nand measured level energies in all the cases considered is\ntaken as an argument for the proper description of such\nsemimagic nuclei within the shell-model framework and\ntherefore of the persistence of the N=50 closed shell down to\nZ=32. The expected shell weakening, possibly manifested\nthrough energetically favored intruder configurations and\ntherefore through low-lying configuration or shape co-\nexistence, will probably appear only for higher spin states or\nfor larger values of the N \/Z ratio.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank the technical staff of the\nTANDEM-ALPI accelerator complex of the Laboratori Na-\nzionali di Legnaro for their support during the experiment.\nThis work was supported by the EU, Contract Nos.\nERBFMGECT 980110 and HPRI-CT-1999-00083.
