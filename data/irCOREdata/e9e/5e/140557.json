Its simple geometry and flow profile means\nthat it serves as a good test case for investigating\nfeedback control for flow systems [1\u20135]. Further-\nmore, plane Poiseuille flow is prone to transition to\nturbulence even when traditional linear analysis\nindicates stability. Experiments show that the flow\ncan undergo transition for Reynolds numbers as low\nas 1000 [6], even though the flow is known to be\nlinearly stable at Reynolds numbers below approxi-\nmately 5772 [7]. In common with many other flows,\nthe state equation of plane Poiseuille flow is highly\nnon-normal. After an initial state perturbation, the\nstate trajectories of non-normal systems may exhibit\nlarge transients; the occurrence of transition in the\nlinearly stable regime of plane Poiseuille flow is\nthought to be due to large transient growth causing\nnon-linear effects [8\u201310].\nThe energy of perturbations (or transient energy)\nis a fundamental notion in the study of turbulence,\nand is used in this paper as a measure of the size of\nthe perturbations of the state. It has a physical\nmeaning, being the energy density of the velocity\nperturbations. The system sensitivity is measured by\nthe maximum transient energy growth following\nsome energy-bounded initial state perturbation; this\nvalue is critical in determining whether the flow will\ntrigger non-linear effects. The maximum transient\nenergy growth has been studied for a number of\nfluid systems [9, 11, p. 112]. A comprehensive\nreview of the role of transient energy growth in as-\nsessing hydrodynamic stability is provided in refer-\nence [12].\nState feedback control that can minimize an upper\nbound on the maximum transient energy growth is\nconsidered in this paper. The general problem of\nconstraining transient trajectory norms by feedback\ncontrol has also been considered recently [13\u201317].\nThese approaches all propose minimizing an upper\nbound on the transient behaviour.

However, these are very computationally\nexpensive, so in this paper an upper bound is\nminimized, even though the bound may be quite\nconservative [17, p. 668]. The problem of minimizing\nan upper bound can be solved by the solution of a\nlinear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. An addi-\ntional LMI is incorporated to constrain the energy of\nthe control effort.\n2 PLANE POISEUILLE FLOW\nIncompressible fluid flow is described by the Navier\u2013\nStokes and continuity equations. The Navier\u2013Stokes\nequations\n_~Uz ~U :+\n\u0001 \u0002\n~U~{\n1\nr\n+Pz\nm\nr\n+2~U \u00f01\u00de\nform a set of three coupled, non-linear, partial\ndifferential equations representing conservation of\nmomentum, where U\n!\nis velocity, P is pressure, r is\ndensity (uniform), and m is viscosity (uniform), and\nthe continuity equation\n+:~U~0 \u00f02\u00de\nis an additional constraint representing the con-\nservation of mass.\nLaminar Poiseuille flow, shown in Fig. 1, has a\nparabolic streamwise velocity profile, with no slip\noccurring at the bounding parallel planes. It under-\ngoes transition to turbulence when small perturba-\ntions ~u~ u, v, w\u00f0 \u00de, p about the steady base profile,\n~Ub~ 1{ y=h\u00f0 \u00de2\n\u0001 \u0002\nUcl, 0, 0\n\u0001 \u0002\n, Pb, grow spatially and\ntemporally to form a self-sustaining turbulent flow.\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations for the perturbations\nabout the base flow, ~Ub, become\n_~uz ~u:+\u00f0 \u00de~uz ~Ub:+\n\u0001 \u0002\n~uz ~u:+\u00f0 \u00de~Ub\n~{\n1\nr\n+pz\nm\nr\n+2~u \u00f03\u00de\nAssuming the perturbations to be small compared\nwith the base flow, the second-order non-linear term\n~u:+\u00f0 \u00de~u can be discarded. Non-dimensionalizing\nequation (3) by dividing length scales by the channel\nhalf-height h, dividing velocities by the base centre-\nline velocity Ucl, and dividing pressure by rU\n2\ncl gives\n_~uz ~Ub:+\n\u0001 \u0002\n~uz ~u:+\u00f0 \u00de ~uz~Ub\n\u0001 \u0002\n~{+pz\n1\nR\n+2~u \u00f04\u00de\nwhere R :5 rUclh\/m is the dimensionless Reynolds\nnumber. Being linear, the continuity equation (2)\nsimply becomes\n+:~u~0 \u00f05\u00de\nFluid flowfield velocity and pressure, and wall shear\nstresses, can be measured. The flow can be influ-\nenced by the manipulation of the conditions on its\nboundaries, for example by wall transpiration, which\nis the injection and suction of fluid at the walls. The\nstate of the flow can be determined from shear stress\nmeasurements at the walls. Hence, active feedback\ncontrol of the evolution of transition is feasible. The\nproposed scheme is shown in Fig. 1. However,\nequations (4) and (5) are infinite dimensional, so,\nin order to be able to use standard finite-dimension\ncontrol methods, and to ensure that the controller is\npractically implementable, these equations must be\napproximated by a finite-dimension linear time-\ninvariant system of the form\n_x~AxzBu \u00f06\u00de\ny~Cx \u00f07\u00de\nHowever, a straightforward discretization results in\na singular system of the form Ex\u02d95Ax +Bu, where\nE is singular. This is a consequence of the alge-\nbraic constraint imposed by continuity equation (5),\nwhich does not contain pressure.\nTo proceed, the pressure perturbation term is\neliminated from equation (4) by substituting equation\n(5), giving an expression for the wall-normal velocity\nL +2v\n\u0003 \u0004\nLt\nzUb\nL +2v\n\u0003 \u0004\nLx\n{\nL2Ub\nLy2\nLv\nLx\n{\n1\nR\n+2 +2v\n\u0003 \u0004\n~0\n\u00f08\u00deFig. 1 Plane Poiseuille flow\n324 J F Whidborne, J McKernan, and G Papadakis\nProc. IMechE Vol. 222 Part I: J. Systems and Control Engineering JSCE493 F IMechE 2008\nFor a complete description of a three-dimensional\nflow perturbation, a second equation is required to\ndescribe the wall-normal vorticity, g, where\ng~\nLu\nLz\n{\nLw\nLx\n\u00f09\u00de\nand equations (4) and (5) give\nLg\nLt\nz\nLUb\nLy\nLv\nLz\nzUb\nLg\nLx\n{\n1\nR\n+2g~0 \u00f010\u00de\nTo implement control by wall transpiration, the\nno-slip wall boundary conditions at y5\u00a11 are re-\nplaced with prescribed wall transpiration velocities,\nu(\u00a11)5 0, v(\u00a11)? 0, w(\u00a11)5 0. It is assumed\nthat disturbances on ~u exist in the streamwise (x),\nwall-normal (y), and spanwise (z) directions. Varia-\ntions in the wall-normal direction are assumed to\nbe non-periodic and are represented by a modified\nChebyshev series that fulfils the wall boundary\nconditions. Variations in the streamwise and span-\nwise directions are assumed to have a periodic\nrepresentation, R(ei(ax+bz)), so flow disturbances\ngrow in time, but not in space. The terms a and b\nare the streamwise and spanwise wave numbers\nrespectively. Substituting the assumed solutions into\nequations (8) and (10) and assuming an exponential\ntime variation results in the classical Orr\u2013Sommer-\nfeld and Squire equations respectively.\nAfter some manipulation of the equations, bound-\nary control of the linearized Navier\u2013Stokes equations\nin a channel at a particular wave-number pair (a, b)\n(with associated variables denoted by u,, v,, etc.)\ncan be represented as a linear state-space system in\nthe standard form of equation (6). The linearized\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations are evaluated at N locations\nin the wall-normal direction (with the locations\nmore closely spaced near the walls), and the state\nvariables x are the Chebyshev coefficients of the\nwall-normal velocity, v,, and vorticity, g,, perturba-\ntions concatenated with the upper and lower wall v,\ntranspiration velocities. For details, see reference\n[20].\nIn this paper, state feedback is used, so it is\nassumed that the system state can be accurately\nmeasured. The inputs, u, are the rates of change in\nsymmetrical and antisymmetrical components of\nwall transpiration velocity. Since these are rates of\nchange, the system contains two integrators, with\neigenvectors representing symmetrical and antisym-\nmetrical steady state transpiration from the walls. The\nChebyshev coefficients are complex, but the state-\nspace system is made real valued by decomposing it\ninto its real- and imaginary-valued parts. The test\ncase considered here is a5 0, b5 2.044, and R5 5000.\nThis test case is linearly stable but has the largest\ntransient energy over all unit initial conditions and\ntime and wave-number pairs, and represents the very\nearliest stages of the transition to turbulence. The\nmodel is discretized in the wall-normal direction with\nN5 20. The order of the resulting model is 2N22. A\n38th-order plant model is high for control purposes,\nbut errors become significant at lower values of N\n[20]. Modelling the turbulence itself would involve\nusing many more degrees of freedom. For a full\nderivation of the state-space model, see reference\n[20].\n3 CONTROL OF TRANSIENT ENERGY GROWTH\nConsider the asymptotically stable, linear, time-\ninvariant system described by the initial-value\nproblem\n_x~Ax, x 0\u00f0 \u00de~x0 \u00f011\u00de\nwith A [Rn|n and x0 [R\nn, which has the continu-\nous solution x : Rz?R\nn, t.W t\u00f0 \u00dex0, where W(t) is\nthe state transition matrix given by W t\u00f0 \u00de~eAt~P?\ni~0 A\niti\n\u0005\ni!.\nFor simplicity of presentation in this section,\nthe transient energy, e(t), is defined as e(t) :5\nmax{||x(t)||2 : ||x0||5 1}. The maximum transient en-\nergy growth, e\u02c6, is defined as e\u02c6 :5max{e(t) : t> 0}. In\npractice, the actual transient energy, e(t), is\ne t\u00f0 \u00de~max Wx t\u00f0 \u00dek k2 : Wx 0\u00f0 \u00dek k~1\nn o\n\u00f012\u00de\nwhere W. 0 is a constant weighting matrix that\nrelates the transient energy with the state variables\nso that the transient energy can be calculated from\nthe norm of the weighted state. Hence, for the\nremaining results in this section to be applicable to\nthe laminar plane Poiseuille flow problem, a simple\nchange of variables x,5Wx should be performed.\nAn upper bound, e\u02c6uo e\u02c6, of the maximum transient\nenergy growth can be obtained by means of a\nLyapunov function that describes an ellipsoid that\nbounds the trajectory. This upper bound is given by\ne^u :~lmax P\u00f0 \u00delmax P{1\n\u0003 \u0004 \u00f013\u00de\nwhere P5PT. 0 satisfies\nPAzATPv0 \u00f014\u00de\nMinimizing transient energy growth in plane Poiseuille flow 325\nJSCE493 F IMechE 2008 Proc.

A proof of the above\ncan be found in reference [19].\nA minimal upper bound can be obtained by\nsolving the following LMI generalized eigenvalue\nproblem (GEVP) [22, p. 65]\nmin c subject to I\u00a1P\u00a1cI, PAzATPv0 \u00f015\u00de\nwhere P. 0 is real and symmetric and e\u02c6( e\u02c6u( c.\nNow consider the actuated case with the linear\ntime-invariant plant\n_x~AxzBu, x 0\u00f0 \u00de~x0 \u00f016\u00de\nwhere B [Rn|\u2018 and u : Rz?R\n\u2018 is a piecewise\ncontinuous function, and with state feedback control\nu5Kx, where K [R\u2018|n.\nAn LMI [22, p. 100] can be formulated to obtain a\ncontroller that minimizes the upper bound e\u02c6u.\nExpanding inequality (14) for the closed-loop system\nmatrix A +BK gives\nPAzATPzPBKzKTBTPv0 \u00f017\u00de\nand with the changes in variable, Q5P21 and\nY5KQ, the LMI\nAQzQATzBYzYTBTv0 \u00f018\u00de\nis obtained. Now, because lmax(P)lmax(P\n21)5\nlmax(Q)lmax(Q\n21), it is possible to obtain a controller\nthat minimizes the upper bound of the maximum\ntransient energy growth by solving the following LMI\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem (GEVP)\nmin c subject to I\u00a1Q\u00a1cI\nAQzQATzBYzYTBTv0 \u00f019\u00de\nand the upper-bound minimizing controller is\nK5YQ21.\nFor a practical design, it is necessary to limit the\nexpenditure of control effort. This can be done by\nsimultaneously solving the above LMI with one\ndescribed in reference [22, p. 103] as follows.

This value\ndiffers slightly (by less than 1 per cent) from the\n326 J F Whidborne, J McKernan, and G Papadakis\nProc. IMechE Vol. 222 Part I: J. Systems and Control Engineering JSCE493 F IMechE 2008\nvalue given in reference [23] of e\u02c654897, owing to the\napproximations made with N520. For larger values of\nN, the LMI problem becomes difficult to solve.\nThe problem is first solved without any restric-\ntion on the control effort, that is, a controller that\nsatisfied problem (19) was obtained. The upper\nbound is e\u02c6u5 1722. The transient energy e(t) is\nshown in Fig. 3. The actual maximum transient en-\nergy growth is e\u02c65 883. There is quite a large gap\nbetween the upper bound and the actual value, as\nnoted in reference [17, p. 668]. As expected, the\ncontrol gains are impractically large, with the largest\ncontrol gain element being max |K|5 776.56103.\nThe effect of including the constraint on the\ncontrol signal (23) is investigated next. Problem\n(26) is solved for a range of values of m. The resulting\ne\u02c6u and corresponding e\u02c6 are shown in Fig. 4. Inter-\nestingly, e\u02c6 is not lowest when m is greatest. This was\nalso seen for the Lorenz equation control system\nstudied in reference [24]. In fact, minimal e\u02c6 occurs\nfor mz 20. For m5 20, the upper bound is e\u02c6u5 1722\nand is only marginally greater than the minimal\nvalue. The actual maximum transient energy growth\nis e\u02c65 825, and the transient energy e(t) is shown\nin Fig. 5. The largest control gain element is max\n|K|5 13.64. Figure 6 shows the worst-case wall\ncontrol uwc5Kxwc, where xwc is the transient x(t)\nthat results in the largest energy gain. Note that\nthe second control signal is zero. The details are\ndiscussed in references [20] and [25].\nThe control effort can be substantially reduced\nwithout a significant performance deterioration by\nsetting m5 0.8. The transient energy e(t) is shown in\nFig. 7, and the actual maximum transient energy\ngrowth is e\u02c65 842. Figure 8 shows the worst-case wall\ncontrol uwc. Again, note that the second control\nsignal is zero. Both the control signal magnitudes\nand the control gains are small, with the largest\ncontrol gain element max |K|5 0.558.\nA finite-volume computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) Navier\u2013Stokes solver is used for non-linear\nsimulation of the system. This solver makes no as-\nsumption of spectral behaviour, solves the full\nnon-linear Navier-Stokes equations, and is com-\npletely independent of the spectral code used for the\ncontroller synthesis and linear simulations. The full\nNavier\u2013Stokes solver employs an unstructured, col-\nlocated grid, and is capable of representing complex\ngeometry, for example as utilized in reference [26],\nalthough a simple structured mesh of the channel is\nFig. 2 Transient energy for system with no transpira-\ntion\nFig. 3 Transient energy for minimal upper-bound\ncontroller with unlimited control effort\nFig. 4 Maximum transient energy growth upper\nbound e\u02c6u (dashed line) and actual maximum\ntransient energy growth e\u02c6 (solid line) versus\ncontrol effort constraint m (log scale)\nMinimizing transient energy growth in plane Poiseuille flow 327\nJSCE493 F IMechE 2008 Proc.

The value is set\nat ||x*0||\n25Ec5 2.26610\n29. This value is 8.561029\nof the base-flow energy density and is approximately\n1\/100th of the open-loop streamwise vortex transition\nthreshold of 2.56\u20132.6561027 as determined by Reddy\net al. [27, p. 292]. From the linear model, the initial\nconditions that result in the \u2018worst-case\u2019 response\nare determined, i.e. the initial conditions such\nthat the resulting state response x*wc(t) satisfies\nmax{||x\n*\nwc(t)||\n2 : t> 0}5 e\u02c6. Here, the response energy\nfrom these initial conditions, ||x\n*\nwc(t)||\n2, is called the\nworst-case response energy. The worst-case response\nenergy with initial energy 104 Ec for the uncon-\ntrolled flow is shown in Fig. 9 (labelled \u2018Linear\u2019),\nalong with the corresponding response energy from\nthe same worst-case initial conditions obtained\nfrom the CFD simulation (labelled \u2018Non-linear\u2019).\nThe peak linear response energy is over 4 times\ngreater than the non-linear CFD response energy.\nAt tz 120 the energy peaks, indicating that the CFD\nsimulated flow has saturated.\nThe minimal upper-bound controller with control\neffort constraint m5 0.8 is considered next. The\nworst-case response energy with initial energy Ec is\nFig. 5 Transient energy for minimal upper-bound\ncontroller with control effort constraint m5 20\nFig. 6 Worst-case wall control for minimal upper-\nbound controller with control effort constraint\nm5 20\nFig. 7 Transient energy for minimal upper-bound\ncontroller with control effort constraint m5 0.8\nFig. 8 Worst-case wall control for minimal upper-\nbound controller with control effort constraint\nm5 0.8\n328 J F Whidborne, J McKernan, and G Papadakis\nProc.

The responses\nare very close, showing that the linear approximation\nis good, and that the states have remained in the\nlinear region. The worst-case response energy with\ninitial energy 104 Ec is shown in Fig. 11. The non-\nlinear response saturates, but the peak is far less\nthan the open-loop response energy from the same\ninitial condition energy shown in Fig. 9.\n5 CONCLUDING COMMENTS\nThe minimization of an upper bound of the max-\nimum transient energy growth of plane Poiseuille\nflow by state-variable feedback has been considered.\nA periodicity assumption on the flow velocity field is\nmade, and the controllers are designed for a single\nwave-number pair. This assumption has practical\nlimitations; control of non-periodic plane Poiseuille\nflow has been tackled in reference [28]. The derived\nlinear model has a higher order than is usual for\ncontrol design. Devising model order reduction\nmethods that retain the modes that are significant\nfor stability and high transient energy growth re-\nmains for future work.\nAlthough H?-, H2-, and L1-based measures are\nusually preferred for control system design [29],\ntransient energy is useful in fluid flow control be-\ncause it is relatively easy to verify through CFD sim-\nulation. The use of H? and H2 norms as stability\nmeasures for fluid flow systems is discussed in detail\nin reference [4].\nMethods have been devised to minimize the actual\nmaximum transient energy growth rather than the\nupper bound [18, 30], but these are very computa-\ntionally intensive and result in very high-order\ncontrollers. The phenomenon of high transient en-\nergy growth is often a symptom of non-normality, a\nproperty of many fluid flow systems. It is envisaged\nthat the approach used here will be suitable for\nanalysing and designing linear control systems for\nany fluid control system that is very non-normal.\nREFERENCES\n1 Joshi, S.
