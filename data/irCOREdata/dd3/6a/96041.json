Gangs are generally more horizontally organized, with lots of small subgroups and no central leadership setting strategy and enforcing discipline.

As Geoff Thale, the Research Director of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), has testified before the US Congress, gangs are just one example of a whole spectrum of violence in Central America, which also includes intra-familial violence, street crime, politically-motivated crimes, drug-related violence, traditional organized crime, state violence, and human rights violations (cited in: C.M.

In \nfocusing on the origins and dynamics of gangs in the region, this article seeks to broaden \nconceptualisations of non-state armed groups by expanding the theoretical optic from a narrow focus \non war and post-war contexts to a wider spectrum of settings, actors, and motivations. It highlights a \ncategory of actors that does not explicitly seek to overthrow the state, but rather progressively \nundermines or assumes certain state functions. The article also reveals how efforts to contain and \nregulate gangs flow from their imputed motives, with interventions influenced by whether they are \nconceived as a criminal or political threat. At the same time, coercive regulation tend to be favoured \neven when such repressive interventions exacerbate gang violence, for reasons that reveal the deeper \nunderlying political, social and economic challenges facing the Central American region.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nGangs are routinely excluded from theoretical and policy debates on \u201cnon-state armed \ngroups\u201d or NSAGs. Rather, the acronym tends to be reserved to clusters of individuals who \ncomrpise rebel opposition groups, guerrillas, localised militia, or civil defence and \nparamilitary forces. In other words, discussions of NSAGs are narrowly confined to groups \noperating in opposition to the state \u2013 often impelled to action by \u201cgreed\u201d or \u201cgrievance\u201d1 \u2013 \nand generally with a view to taking it over.2 Conceptualisations are thus embedded in a state-\ncentric framework wherein the state is not just a key referent, but according to Alston, \u201cthe \nindispensable and pivotal one around which all other entities revolve\u201d.3 Consequently, efforts \nto engage and contain NSAGs tend to focus on their (il)legitimacy and the extent to which \nthey can be made to comply to the prescribed norms and rules of state action. \nAt the same time, however, as other authors in this special issue make clear, signficant \nambiguity persists concerning the conceptual parameters of the concept. Interpretations are \nfrequently dependent as much on the circumstances and motivations of the observer as the \n(actual) interests and characteristics of the observed. Tellingly, human rights scholars such as \nClapham (forthcoming) advocate for as broad a definition as possible including \u201cevery entity \napart from states\u201d. Likewise, Alston (2005) includes a host of entities ranging from rebel \ngroups and terrorist organisations to religious associations, militant civil society \norganizations, private corporations and businesses and even some international agencies.4 \nCertain researchers have also focused on the environment(s) in which non-state armed groups \noperate, or else their attributed or imputed motives, in order to articulate coherent forms of \nclassification.  \nWhile it is recognised that the \u201ctypes\u201d of NSAGs are dynamic and fluid, there is \nnevertheless a tendency in the literature to focus primarily on their manifestations in war or \npost-war contexts.5 This is largely due to the centrality attributed by international relations \nscholars and policy makers to (liberal) state building and the consolidation of the monopoly \nover violence in fragile post-war settings. NSAGs are thus frequently cast as explicit threats, \nspoilers and a \u201ccause of instability around the globe\u201d.6 Yet an increasing number of studies \nreveal that such groups also originate and thrive in non-war situations.7 Moreover, they can \nalso be understood as alternative and legitimate nodes of authority to the state, particularly \nwhen the latter is perceived to be ineffectual and\/or repressive.8 Indeed, gangs provide a \n 3\ncompelling example of both of these observations, as is well evidenced by the contemporary \nCentral American context. \nThis article provides a descriptive overview of the regional gang panorama in Central \nAmerica, in order to highlight its underlying logic and dynamics. It seeks to broaden the \ntheoretical debate on NSAGs beyond a narrow treatment of guerrilla and rebel groups fighting \nto purposefully assume control of the state. In particular, it seeks to account for non-state \narmed groups that despite perhaps undermining the state by virtue of their violence, are not \nconsciously seeking direct control over all (or even any) of its institutions. It also reveals a \ncomplex dialectic shaping gang-state relations \u2013 including the instrumental \u2018criminalisation\u2019 \nof the former by the latter as a means of concealing more fundamental social and economic \ninjustices and disparities. The article is divided into three sections, beginning with a brief \noverview of violence in contemporary Central America, before then characterising the \ndifferentiated origins and dynamics of gangs operating in the region. It concludes with an \nassessment of state-led policy response to Central American gangs and related implications \nfor future scholarship on non-state armed groups. \n \nViolence in contemporary Central America \n \nViolence is on the upswing in Central America,9 with the region currently exhibiting amongst \nthe highest rates of reported homicide and criminal victimisation in Latin America and indeed \nthe world.10 While the annual global homicide rate was estimated by the WHO to be \napproximately 8 per 100,000, in the Americas the figure was over 20 per 100,000, and in \nCentral America above 30 per 100,000.11 Homicidal violence is described by policy makers \nand public health researchers as one of the primary population health issues facing societies \nacross the region,12 with perpetration and victimisation of violence particularly concentrated \namongst young males between 15 and 34 years of age.  \nThere are many determinants shaping the temporal, demographic and spatial dynamics \nof violence. The World Bank, for example, attributes the rise in Central American violence to \n\u201ca complex set of factors, including rapid urbanization, persistent poverty and inequality, \nsocial exclusion, political violence, organized crime, post-conflict cultures, the emergence of \nillegal drug use and trafficking and authoritarian family structures\u201d.13 The United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also emphasizes the role of geography and weak \ninstitutions; with an estimated 90 per cent of the cocaine supplies destined for the US passing \nthrough Central American states from Andean production centres, organised crime and \nviolence are both enmeshed and entrenched.14\nOne of the most visible faces of the new Central American panorama of violence is \nthe gang phenomenon. Gangs are by no means an uncommon social phenomena. They can be \nobserved in most societies around the world, although the vast majority of what are identified \nas \u201cgangs\u201d are often little more than ephemeral groups of youth who gather on street corners \nand engage in behaviour that is frequently labelled \u201canti-social\u201d. Gangs in the proper sense of \nthe term are much more definite social organisations that display an institutional continuity \nthat is independent of their membership. They have fixed conventions and rules, which can \ninclude initiation rituals, a ranking system, rites of passage, and rules of conduct that make \nthe gang a primary source of identity for members. Gang codes often demand particular \nbehaviour patterns from members, such as adopting characteristic dress, tattoos, graffiti, hand \nsigns, and slang, as well as regular involvement in illicit and violent activities. Such gangs are \nalso often \u2013 but not always \u2013 associated with a particular territory, and their relationship with \nlocal communities can be either oppressive or protective (indeed, this can change from one to \nthe other over time). Central American gangs clearly correspond to this second type of \ninstitution. \n 4\nAlthough gangs have long featured in Central American societies, certainly well \nbefore the wars of the 1980s and early 1990s, they have experienced unprecedented growth \nand attention in the past two decades. Estimates of the total proportion of contemporary \nregional violence attributable to gangs vary wildly from 10 to 60 per cent,15 while they have \nbeen accused of a whole slew of crimes and delinquency, ranging from mugging, theft, and \nintimidation, to rape, assault, and organised\/petty drug dealing. More recently, there have \neven been attempts to link gangs to incipient revolution and global terrorism. A 2005 US \nArmy War College publication contends that Central American gangs constitute a \u201cnew urban \ninsurgency\u201d that had as an ultimate objective \u201cto depose or control the governments of \ntargeted countries\u201d through \u201ccoups d\u2019street\u201d (sic), for example.16 Similarly, Anne Aguilera, \nthe head of the Central America office of the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement \nAffairs branch of the US State Department recently asserted that gangs were \u201cthe greatest \nproblem for national security at this time in Central America\u201d.17 Although gangs are \nunquestionably a significant security concern, such obviosuly sensationalist pronouncements \nsuggest that they remain profoundly misunderstood and betray a profound lack of \nunderstanding of their underlying logic.18\n \nThe Gangs of Central America \n \nReliable information on the scale, dynamics and demographics of Central American gangs is \nscarce. Official statistics are especially problematic owing to chronic underreporting, deficient \ndata collection, and issues of political interference.19 Publicly available figures indicate that \nthere are some 70,000 gang members operating in Central America. By way of contrast, a \nhost of NGOs and academics contend that the number is likely much higher, as many as \n200,000, while the UNODC provides a range that goes up to as many as 500,000 gang \nmembers.20 Even a lower estimate suggests that the numbers of gang members rivals the \narmed forces of most countries in Central America: Nicaragua and Honduras have armies of \nabout 12,000 soldiers each, El Salvador 13,000 soldiers, and Guatemala 27,000.21 While there \nis comparatively limited reliable quantitative data available on gangs, there are an increasing \nnumber of qualitative studies suggesting that gangs constitute primary actors within the \ncontemporary regional panorama of violence.22  \nQualitative studies also reveal considerable diversity amongst gangs in and between \ncountries in the Central American region. Specifically, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras \nare currently experiencing more severe levels of gang violence than Nicaragua, for example \n(although violence in this latter country is much higher than generally reported23 \u2013 while the \nproblem is of a completely different \u2013 and lower \u2013 order of magnitude in Costa Rica and \nPanama. Likewise, the distribution of violence within these countries varies greatly, even if \nthe overwhelming majority of gang violence can definitely be said to occur in urban areas, \nparticularly in capital cities (which are often primate settlements within the national context). \nThis is not entirely surprising. Gangs are very much urban manifestations since a critical \ndemographic mass of youth in inevitably necessary for a gang to emerge.  \nThere is in fact a strong correlation between violence-affected urban spaces and gang \nconsolidation, size and distribution. Certain studies have reported that up to 15 per cent of \nyouth within gang-affected communities may ultimately join a gang. Other assessments \nsuggest that on average, the figure is likely closer to 3 to 5 per cent. Gangs tend to register \nbetween 15 and 100 members, although the average size is approximately 20-25 members.24 \nMoreover, gangs are not evenly distributed within cities. Although the association between \npoverty and gang violent is neither causal nor systematic, gangs are more likely to emerge in \npoorer and marginal sections of the urban landscape. There are of course many exceptions to \nthe rule: a study in Guatemala\u2019s capital found that neighbourhoods falling within the \n 5\nmetropolis\u2019 bottom quartile in terms of impoverishment suffered from comparatively less \ngang-related crime than neighbourhoods falling within the second-to-last quartile.25\nThe vast majority of real and potential gang members are male youth.26 There is also \nevidence of all-female gangs operating in Nicaragua and Guatemala.27 The age range of gang \nmembers can be highly varied, although a 2001 study based on some 1,000 interviews with \ngang members conducted by researchers at the Instituto Universitario de Opini\u00f3n P\u00fablica \n(IUDOP) in El Salvador found that the average gang member in the country was 20 years old, \nwith a mean age of entry into the gang of 15 years of age. Nicaraguan gang members have \nbeen found to fall between 7 and 23 years old, while the age of Guatemalan and Honduran \ngang members ranges from 12 to 30 years of age.  \nMost studies of Central American gangs have highlighted the difficulties of \nsystematically pinpointing specific factors explaining gang membership. Stereotypical \n\u201cdeterminants\u201d such as family fragmentation, domestic abuse, or a particular psychological \nmake-up are not consistently significant, and the only factor that has been reported as \nsystematically affecting gang membership is religion, insofar as evangelical Protestant youths \nin Nicaragua tend not to join gangs.28 The IUDOP assessment found that some 40 per cent of \nrespondents claimed to join gangs in order to \u201chang out\u201d, 21 per cent because they had gang \nmember friends, and 21 per cent in order to avoid from family problems. The study also found \na partial correlation between youth unemployment and gang membership: 17 per cent of gang \nmembers were employed, and 66 per cent actively characterised themselves as \n\u201cunemployed\u201d.29  \nThe emergence and spread of gangs are commonly linked to structural factors, \nincluding the pervasive machismo that characterises Central American societies (many gang \ncodes are clearly expressions of a heightened masculinity). Other influencing factors include \nhigh levels of social exclusion and inequality, the long history of war and its aftermath in \nseveral countries,30 the unregulated availability of weapons (it is estimated that there are over \ntwo million unregistered small arms in Central America),31 as well as the widespread absence \nof the state and concomitant \u201clocal governance voids\u201d that gangs seek to fill as \u201cmicro-\npolitical\u201d social forms.32 Considering that these factors affect Central American youth \nuniversally, but not all youth become gang members, they must be seen more as contextual \nvariables than determinants, however.  \nA more significant variable shaping the formation and consolidation of gangs is \nmigration. Even if there is frequently a tendency to talk about Central American gangs \ngenerically, a distinction must be made between \u201cmaras\u201d on the one hand, and \u201cpandillas\u201d on \nthe other. Maras are a phenomenon with transnational roots, while pandillas are more \nlocalised, home-grown entities that are the direct inheritors of the youth gangs that have long \nbeen a historic feature of Central American societies. Pandillas were initially present in \ncertain countries emerging from war during the 1990s, but are now only significantly visible \nin Nicaragua \u2013 and to a lesser extent in Costa Rica (where they are often called \u201cchapulines\u201d) \n\u2013 having been almost completely supplanted by maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, and \nHonduras. \nThe contemporary manifestation of the pandilla phenomenon finds its origins during \nthe transition from war to peace in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this period, \ndemobilised combatant youth in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala returned to their \nhome communities and faced situations of heightened uncertainty, insecurity, and socio-\neconomic flux within a broader context of state crisis and fragility. Drawing on what was \neffectively a traditional organisational vehicle for youth collective action, some of these \nyoung men formed localised vigilante-style self-defence groups in an attempt to provide a \nmeasure of order and predictability both for themselves and their local communities, with \nmany community members embracing these early gangs as the sole predictable source of \n 6\norder and authority. From these relatively fluid and organic beginnings, pandillas rapidly \nbegan to develop particular behaviour patterns, which included engaging in semi-ritualised \nforms of gang warfare that were regulated by strict codes and expectations, including in \nparticular protecting local territories and residents.33\nClear parallels can be made with past gangs insofar as these often emerged as informal \ndefence organisations in illegal squatter settlements. The pandillas of the mid and late 1990s \nwere however much more numerous and also more violent than their predecessors, partly due \nto the legacy of war and insurrection which provided youth with unprecedented martial \nskills.34 They also became much more institutionalised than past gangs \u2013 which tended to be \ngenerationally ephemeral \u2013 giving themselves names \u2013 examples from Nicaragua include los \nDragones, los Rampleros, or los Comemuertos (\u201cEaters of the Dead\u201d) \u2013 and developing \nhierarchies and rules that persisted over time, irrespective of gang member turnover.35 Thus, \nto interpret pandillas solely as a form of post-conflict violence would be rather limiting, \ninsofar as contemporary gang members were often born after the war in Nicaragua ended. \nUltimately, pandillas can best be interpreted as localised institutional responses to the \ncircumstances of insecurity, exclusion, and uncertainty that affected many Central American \ncountries during the 1990s and 2000s, even if there were significant variations both between \nand within different societies. \nThe maras, on the other hand, are groups that can be directly linked to specific \nmigratory patterns. Formally, there are just two maras, the Dieciocho (18) and the \nSalvatrucha (MS). They are present only in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras within the \nCentral American region, although they have reportedly begun to extend into Southern \nMexico as well. The origins of the maras reside in the 18th Street gang in Los Angeles, a gang \nfounded by Mexican immigrants in the Rampart section of the city in the 1960s, although it \nrapidly began to accept Hispanics indiscriminately. The 18th Street gang grew significantly \nduring the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of the influx of mainly Salvadoran and \nGuatemalan refugees, who sought to incorporate into the gang in order to feel included as \noutsiders in the US. In the latter half of the 1980s, a rival \u2013 possibly splinter \u2013 group founded \nby a second wave of Salvadoran refugees emerged, known as the \u201cMara Salvatrucha\u201d (a \ncombination of \u201cSalvadore\u00f1o\u201d and \u201ctrucha\u201d, meaning \u201cquick-thinking\u201d or \u201cshrewd\u201d in \nSalvadoran slang).36 The Dieciocho and the Salvatrucha rapidly became bitter rivals, and \nfrequently fought each other on the streets of Los Angeles.  \nThe two groups were also heavily involved in the violence and looting that \naccompanied the 1992 Rodney King riots. As a result, the State of California subsequently \nimplemented strict anti-gang laws and prosecutors charged young gang members as adults \ninstead of minors, sending hundreds to jail for felonies and other serious crimes. By 1996, the \nUS Congress established the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nwhich ensured that non-US citizens sentenced to a year or more in prison were to be \nrepatriated to their countries of origin. Even foreign-born US naturalised felons could be \nstripped of their citizenship and expelled once they served out their prison terms. As a result, \nbetween 1998 and 2005 the US deported almost 46,000 convicts to Central America, in \naddition to 160,000 illegal immigrants caught without their requisite permits.37  \nCentral America\u2019s northern triangle \u2013 El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras \u2013 \nreceived over 90 per cent of the deportations from the US.38 Many of these deportees were \nmembers of the 18th Street and Salvatrucha gangs who had arrived in the US as toddlers but \nhad never secured legal residency or citizenship. Many had joined gangs as a way to feel \nsocially included in a receiving country that routinely impeded their integration. Owing to \ntheir sense of exclusion from the US and following their arrival in countries of \u201corigin\u201d that \nthey seldom knew, it is unsurprising that they reproduced the structures and behaviour \npatterns that had provided them with support and security during their time in the US. \n 7\nDeportees rapidly began to found local \u201cclikas\u201d, or chapters, of their gang in their \ncommunities of origin, which in turn rapidly began to attract local youth and either supplanted \nor absorbed local pandillas.39\nEach clika is explicitly affiliated with either the Mara Dieciocho (as the 18th Street \ngang is known in Central America) or the Mara Salvatrucha. But while clikas from different \nneighbourhoods affiliated with the same mara will often join together to fight other groupings \nclaiming allegiance to the opposing mara, neither gang is a real federal structure, and much \nless a transnational one. Neither the Dieciocho nor the Salvatrucha gangs answer to a single \nchain of command, and their \u201cumbrella\u201d nature is more symbolic of a particular historical \norigin than demonstrative of any real organisational unity, be it of leadership or action.  \nIn many ways, the federated nature of the maras is more of an imagined social \nmorphology than an actually occurring phenomenon, based on the fact that the steady flows \nof deportees from the US share a common language and reference points. To this extent, \nalthough the maras can be conceived as (very loose) networks of localised gangs, these do not \nnecessarily communicate or coordinate either within or between countries. Certainly, there is \nlittle evidence of any cooperation between maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, \nand even less with the original putative \u201cmother gangs\u201d in Los Angeles. Rather, the ties that \nexist are more akin to a common sense of social identity, founded organically on individuals\u2019 \nexperiences of gangsterism in the US, deportation, and stigmatisation in Central America.  \nThe migratory origin of the maras is a crucial factor explaining why Nicaragua does \nnot have maras. Not only does Nicaragua register a very low deportation rate from the US \u2013 \nless than 3 per cent of all Central American deportees are Nicaraguan \u2013 but Nicaraguans who \nhave emigrated to the US have mainly settled in Miami. According to US census data, only 12 \nper cent have settled in Los Angeles, where they account for just 4 per cent of Central \nAmericans in the city, while in Miami they represent 47 per cent \u2013 where contrarily to the \nmore \u201copen\u201d gangs of LA, the local gang scene is dominated by highly exclusive African-\nAmerican and Cuban-American gangs which do not let Nicaraguans join them.40 This is also \na potentially important factor explaining why Nicaraguan pandillas are not as violent as \nmaras, and by extension why El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are more violent than \nNicaragua. The transnational transposition of US gang culture in the Northern three Central \nAmerican countries has arguably had much more brutal results due to the fact that it is clearly \nless embedded within a local institutional context than traditional Central American pandilla \nculture, and therefore less rule-bound and constrained. At the same time, it is important to \nnote that the mara phenomenon is not simply a foreign problem imported by deportees, but \nrather has evolved and grown in response to domestic factors and conditions. \nIn contrast to sensationalist accounts linking Central American gangs to migrant \ntrafficking, kidnapping, and international organised crime, it seems that both pandillas and \nmaras are mainly involved in small-scale, localised crime and delinquency such as petty theft \nand muggings.41 These activities are frequently carried out on an individual basis, although \nthe maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are also increasingly collectively \ninvolved in the extortion of protection money from local businesses and the racketeering of \nbuses and taxis as they pass through the territories they control. Both pandillas and maras \nhowever make use of military-style weaponry such as AK-47s and explosives such as \nfragmentation grenades. The 2001 IUDOP survey of Salvadoran gang members mentioned \nabove for example found that 25 per cent of those questioned admitted to having committed a \nmurder in the past year, while 25 per cent refused to answer the question.42 Even so, most \npandilla and mara violence is circumscribed, occurring as it does in the poorer, local \ncommunities from which the gangs emerge rather than wealthier neighbourhoods. The \nmajority of gang violence in fact tends to be directed against rival gangs, as was for example \n 8\nstarkly illustrated by the occurrence of tit-for-tat prison warfare between rival incarcerated \ngang members in Guatemala.43  \nNevertheless, both pandillas and maras have become increasingly involved in \nnarcotics trafficking and dealing over the past decade.44 It is worth recalling that the \nconsumption of drugs has long been associated with the gang lifestyle, as well as the fact that \nCentral America has become a transit point for most cocaine traffic between the Andean \ncountries and North America.45 Drug trafficking in Central America tends to be decentralised, \nhowever, with shipments passing from small local cartels to other local cartels, members of \nwhom extract a profit before narcotics are then passed on to the more organised Mexican \ncartels. The role that gangs \u2013 both maras and pandillas \u2013 serve is principally as the local \nsecurity apparatus of the smaller cartels, or as modest street vendors connected to larger \nplayers on an informal basis. Gangs on their own are neither involved in the large-scale, \ntransnational movement of drugs nor in wholesaling, although certain studies suggest that the \nleaders of these small, local cartels are often ex-gang members who have \u201cgraduated\u201d. At the \nsame time, there is compelling evidence that involvement in drug trafficking and dealing is \nleading to the elaboration of more violent behavioural patterns among both categories of \ngangs.46\nThis can however also be linked to the fact that increasingly large swathes of the \nurban poor in Central America are finding themselves able to access fewer and fewer licit \neconomic opportunities. Having to survive as best they can outside the formal ambit of the \nstate, they generally do so based on \u201cruthless Darwinian competition\u201d, with competition \u201cfor \nthe same informal scraps, ensur[ing] self-consuming communal violence as yet the highest \nform of urban involution\u201d.47 Such processes are reinforced by the new patterns of segregation \nand exclusion that have emergence in Central American cities as a result of their market-led \nurban re-modelling, for example through the proliferation of gated communities and closed \ncondominiums, as well as the transformation of transport networks.48 Such patterns of \nsegregation and exclusion are also related to the emergence of new forms of (repressive) state \ngovernance. On the urban plane this has involved patterns of regular police patrolling in \nwealthier areas of the city and on the new roads on the one hand, and the unpredictable, \narbitrary, and violent patrolling of slums and poor neighbourhoods on the other.49 This has \nserved to precipitate localised conditions of terror and to symbolically demonstrate the power \nof the elite-captured state.50 The most visible facet of this new approach is the implementation \nof a \u201cwar on gangs\u201d by Central American states over the past five years.51\n \nMano Dura: The war on gangs \n \nThe opening salvo of the veritable \u201cwar on gangs\u201d currently raging in Central America was El \nSalvador\u2019s adoption of a \u201cMano Dura\u201d (\u201cIron Fist\u201d) policy in July 2003. The directive \nadvocated the immediate imprisonment of gang member for having gang-related tattoos or \nflashing gang signs in public, a crime punishable by two to five years in jail and applicable to \ngang members from the age of 12 and older. Between July 2003 and August 2004, \napproximately 20,000 pandilleros were arrested, although 95 per cent of them were eventually \nreleased without charge when the Mano Dura law was declared unconstitutional by the \nSalvadoran Supreme Court for violating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the \nChild (UNCRC). A new \u201cMano Super Dura\u201d package of anti-gang reforms was rapidly \napproved, which respected the provisions of the UNCRC but stiffened the penalties for gang \nmembership to up to 5 years in prison for ordinary gang members, and 9 years for gang \nleaders. Although under the new law the police is required to demonstrate proof of active \ndelinquent behaviour in order to arrest an individual, El Salvador\u2019s prison population has \n 9\ndoubled over the past five years, from 6,000 to 12,000, 40 per cent of which are gang \nmembers.52\nHonduras implemented a comparable policy called \u201cCero Tolerancia\u201d (\u201cZero \nTolerance\u201d) almost simultaneously in August 2003, which was also partly inspired by Rudy \nGiuliani\u2019s eponymous policy in New York. Among the measures that this package promoted \nwas the reform of the penal code and the adoption of legislation that established a maximum \n12-year prison sentence for gang membership, a penalty which was later stiffened to 30 years, \nas well as provisions for better collaboration between the police and the Honduran army in \nurban patrolling. Guatemala likewise adopted its \u201cPlan Escoba\u201d (\u201cOperation Broomsweep\u201d) \nin January 2004 which, although not as draconian as the Salvadoran Mano Dura and the \nHonduran Cero Tolerancia, still contained new provisions allowing minors to be treated as \nadults, and the deployment of four thousand reserve army troops in troubled neighbourhoods \nin Guatemala City. Nicaragua similarly regularly implemented a range of anti-gang initiatives \nfrom 1999 onwards, although these were of a significantly \u201csofter\u201d nature.53 Although these \ncrackdowns have been very popular with the general public in all the Central American \ncountries, they have also been vigorously opposed by human rights groups who are concerned \nwith the potential abuse of gang suspects. More ominously, organisations such as Human \nRights Watch and Amnesty International have presented evidence \u2013 corroborated by the US \nState Department in 2005 \u2013 of the existence of paramilitary death squads in Honduras and El \nSalvador that are deliberately targeting gang members, and often youth more generally, in \ncollusion with state authorities.54\nCentral American states have also initiated unprecedented regional cooperation in \norder to deal with gangs. During a September 2003 summit of heads of state, gangs were \ndeclared to be \u201ca destabilising menace, more immediate than any conventional war or \nguerrilla\u201d. By January 2004, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua agreed to lift \nlegal barriers to the cross-country prosecution of gang members, whatever their nationality. In \nMarch 2005, Presidents Saca of El Salvador and Berger of Guatemala agreed to establish a \njoint security force to patrol gang activity along their common border.  \nCentral American states have also sought to involve the US. Although initially \nresistant to participate in anti-gang initiatives, the US position changed in June 2004 after the \nHonduran Minister of Security, claimed that a suspected Saudi member of Al Qaeda, Yafar \nAl-Taya, had arrived in Salvador in order to meet with gang leaders. Although an unfounded \nand likely spurious assertion, by December 2004, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \nhad created a special task force focusing on Central American gangs. In February 2005 it \nannounced the creation of a liaison office in San Salvador to coordinate regional information-\nsharing and anti-gang efforts. Following a new (and no less ludicrous) claim by the Honduran \nMinister of Security to have thwarted a Colombian FARC-mara plot to kill President Maduro \nin April 2005, Central American military leaders formally called on the US Southern \nCommand for assistance in the creation of a multinational force to tackle organized crime and \nyouth gangs, although this has yet to be implemented. Likewise, the Merida Initiative, in \ncoordination with the US, also emphasises security provision enhancement in Central \nAmerica and Mexico,55 with the objective to counter the trade in drugs, reduce weapons \ntrafficking and confront gangs and organised crime.56\nSuch heavy-handed policies have clearly been widely supported,57 partly due to the \nvisibility they afford political leaders and their constituencies, but also because in many ways \nthey mimic the principle kind of response that states plagued by NSAGs have adopted around \nthe world. As such they arguably serve to classificatory function, by drawing implicit \nparallels between gangs and other violent organisations that they are not necessarily \nequivalent to, even if they can be said to belong to the same spectrum. Having said, that, \nalthough there are some reports that different anti-gang initiatives significantly reduced \n 10\ncrime, there is evidence that these interventions have been generating significant changes in \ngang dynamics, with increasing reports that the widespread heavy-handed repression of gangs \nis leading to their becoming more organized and more violent.58\nThis is something that was well illustrated by the tit-for-tat violence that certain maras \nengaged in with the Honduran authorities following the implementation of Mano Dura. \nSpecifically, on 30 August 2003, one month after the promulgation of the new anti-gang \nlegislation, gang members attacked a bus in the Northern city of San Pedro Sula in broad \ndaylight, killing 14, and leaving 18 wounded, as well as a note to President Maduro ordering \nhim to withdraw the law. The following month, in the town of Puerto Cortes, a young \nwoman\u2019s head was found in a plastic bad with a note addressed to President Maduro saying \nthat this was a response to the extrajudicial assassination of a gang member by the police. \nOver the course of the following year, more than 10 decapitated corpses were left in various \ncities with messages from gang members to the Honduras president, each time in response to \na putative extrajudicial killing, and on 23 December 2004, in Chamalecon, gang members \nagain attacked a bus and killed 28, once again leaving a message claiming revenge for the \nMay 2004 death of 105 gang members in a prison following a suspect fire. Similarly \ngruesome events have been reported in El Salvador and Guatemala. \nThe \u201cwar on gangs\u201d has reportedly also led to maras changing their behaviour patterns \nin less violent but nonetheless insidious ways. For one, gangs are attempting to become less \nconspicuous. For example, gang members in El Salvador have begun to use less obvious signs \nand symbols, including in particular getting rid of tattoos and no longer keeping their hair in \nthe short-trimmed rapado style, in order to avoid being arrested. They have also become more \nmobile, with the emigration of maras into Southern Mexico widely attributed to the \nrepression.59 While this might be interpreted as gangs losing ground vis-\u00e0-vis Central \nAmerican states, their underlying evolutionary trajectory suggests otherwise. The \ntransformation of Nicaraguan pandillas between the 1990s and the 2000s is a case in point. \nThese moved from being institutions that attempted to create localised forms of social order \nand belonging to organisations promoting parochial forms of drug dealing instead. Rather \nthan protecting local neighbourhood inhabitants, gangs acted to ensure the proper functioning \nof local drug economies solely in the interests of their members and associated local dealers \u2013 \nmore often than not ex-gang members \u2013 through the imposition of localised regimes of terror \nbased on fear, threats, and widespread acts of arbitrary violence.60 By 2007, however, \npandillas in Nicaragua seemed to be disappearing, as most gang members were \u201cretiring\u201d and \nnot being replaced by a new generation, with a small minority joining more professional and \nde-territorialised criminal organisations that emerged around drug trafficking.61 This \nprofessionalisation is ominous, insofar as the corrosive role that organised crime can play in \ndeveloping contexts is well-known,62 and clearly has much more wide-ranging consequences \nthan youth gangsterism. \nWhile a tendency toward heavy-handed responses persists in Central American \ncountries, there recently appears to be an increasing evolution from \u201cfirst\u201d to \u201csecond \ngeneration\u201d policies.63 First generation initiatives such as Mano Dura can be characterised as \nenforcement-first, combining aggressive crack-down operations with increased penalties to \ndeter gang membership. Interventions are executed by the state security apparatus together \nwith reforms on the judicial and penal systems, as well as, in many cases, extra-judicially.64 \nRehabilitation is seldom integrated into such strategies, which can therefore contribute to the \nstigmatization of gang members and prevent their reform and ultimately reintegration into \nsociety. In the wake of the significant criticism that such activities have generated, Mano \nDura programmes are being increasingly complemented \u2013 although not necessarily replaced \u2013 \nby Mano Amiga (friendly hand) and Mano Extendida (extended hand) interventions focused \non incentivizing demobilization from gangs. These second generation activities are typically \n 11\nmore compliance and voluntary-oriented and combine carrots with sticks to address the risks \nand symptoms of gang violence.65\nThe question remains, however, to what extent such second generation initiatives truly \nrepresent a transformation in Central American policy culture. In a detailed study mapping \nout the incentives governing the institutional and organisational framework regarding youth \nviolence reduction in Nicaragua, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rocha traces how the government\u2019s promotion of \nsecond generation policies is in many ways highly cosmetic, and principally aimed at \npleasing potential donors and raising international funds. On the ground, government action \nremains much more \u201cfirst generation\u201d in nature.66 Similar dynamics are evident in other \nCentral American countries, furthermore underscored by the fact that there is little empirical \nevidence that second generation approaches are actually achieving major changes on the \nground.67 What this ultimately suggests is that there may well be ulterior motives on the part \nof Central American states to continue to stigmatise and treat gangs in a way that associates \nthem with insurgents and other \u201cclassic\u201d NSAGs. Ultimately social policy choices inevitably \nreflect to the political and economic dynamics underlying any given society, and seen from \nthis perspective, perhaps the biggest obstacles to the coherent application of \u201csecond \ngeneration\u201d gang violence-reduction politics in Central America is the deeply entrenched \noligarchic nature of societies in question, and the hugely unequal political economies that \nthey display,68 but which are obscured by discourses laying the blame on gangs that must be \ncracked down upon at all costs. \n \nConclusion \n \nGangs constitute a very real but much misunderstood feature of the Central American \npanorama of violence. There is no doubt that a significant proportion of regional violence is \nattributable to the phenomenon. Even so, gangs constitute in the main a local level security \nchallenge rather than the transnational threat that the media and some policy outlets make \nthem out to be. Although they are clearly linked to an array of deep-rooted factors such as the \nlong legacy of war, machismo, and the availability of small arms in the region, they are also \nan immediate symptom of growing inequality and exclusion, and as such a reflection of \ndeeply iniquitous social processes. Most research on gang formation emphasises the role of \nsocial and economic variables such as marginalisation, rapid and unregulated social change, \nand lack of meaningful opportunities. Moreover, both a careful appraisal of the origins of \ngangs, as well as their evolution over time suggests that although they may well often emerge \nin post-conflict contexts, these are not necessarily determining of their emergence. \nThe contemporary Central American landscape of violence clearly suggests that gangs \ncan be conceived as important non-state armed groups despite the fact that they lack ambition \nto overthrow the state. Gang violence tends to be only indirectly eroding or undermining the \nstate, often emerging instead as a result of state weakness, as gangs seeks to potentially fill in \nfor the absence of certain state functions. But the dialectical relationship between gangs and \nstate institutions must be carefully interrogated. The proposition that gangs can be seen as \nNSAGs is clearly supported by the fact that the presence of gangs more often than not leads to \na violent state reaction, which effectively treats them as an enemy \u201cother\u201d in a manner very \nsimilar to its treatment of more conventional rebels or insurgent organisations. This more \noften than not leads to an upsurge of collective and inter-personal violence, however, as the \ncase of mara violence following the implementation of Mano Dura in Honduras dramatically \nillustrates, and can lead to a transformation in the nature of gang violence. \nThe repressive approach adopted by Central American governments has in many cases \nexacerbated the problem, precipitating a tit-for-tat spiral of violence and radicalising the \ngangs. Repression simply does not remedy the underlying factors that contributed to gang \n 12\nformation and consolidation in the first place, and is leading to the rise of more organised \ncrime. Although second generation initiatives have been promoted, these have yielded few \nconcrete results, largely because the form of social policy within any given social context will \nultimately inevitably reflect to a greater or lesser degree the political dispensation and \neconomic dynamics of a given society. As such, arguably one of the biggest obstacles to \ndeveloping a coherent approach to gang violence in Central America is the deeply entrenched \noligarchic nature of societies in question, and their hugely unequal political economies.69\nThis of course takes us beyond the relatively straight-forward dilemmas associated \nwith policy paralysis, and begs the question of why some Central American governments are \nundertaking visible and widely-publicised crackdowns on gangs. In many ways, they divert \nattention from the fact that states are otherwise doing little to remedy to the admittedly much \nmore tricky issues of to exclusion, inequality, and the lack of meaningful employment \ncreation. Put another way, gangs have become convenient scapegoats. They allow certain \nactors to avoid addressing basic social and economic challenges and allow those in power \nattempt to maintain an unequal status quo. This is a potentially important insight in relation to \nNSAGs, insofar as they are rarely considered from this perspective, in terms of the functions \nthat their being classified as such play within the wider political economy of both intra- and \ninter-state relations. It also suggests that the tensions and conflicts that lead to the emergence \nof NSAGs are very much systemic, and cannot be understood solely in terms of narrowly \nconceived impulses linked to simplistic rational utility frameworks.70\n \nReferences \n \nAguilar, J., (2006), \u201cLos efectos contraproducentes de los Planes Mano Dura\u201d, Quorum, 16 \n(Winter): 81-94. \nAguilar, J., and L.

Pinheiro, World Report on Violence against Children (Geneva: United \nNations, 2006), pp.357 - indirectly supports the notion that gangs are an important factor within the regional \npanorama of violence, even though they are by no means  the only vector of violence in Central America. \n27 See D.

It can be speculated that this is perhaps because the totalising nature of evangelical Protestantism \nis such that churches constitute a complete organisational framework for their members that is institutionally \nequivalent to that provided by the gang. \n29 M. Santacruz Giralt and A. Concha-Eastman, Barrio Adentro: La Solidaridad Violenta de las Pandillas, (San \nSalvador: Instituto Universitario de Opini\u00f3n P\u00fablica (IUDOP), 2001). \n30 Despite the introduction of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes in the wake of various \npeace agreements, large numbers of ex-soldiers and militia were only partially integrated back into civilian life. \nSee, for example, Robert Muggah, Securing Protections: Dealing with Fighters in the Aftermath of War (New \nYork: Routledge, forthcoming), for a review of DDR programmes. In many ways, however, demobilization-\nrelated gang violence can be seen less as a function of war than of the return to peace. \n31 See W. Godnick, R. Muggah and C. Waszink, \u2018Stray Bullets: The Impact of Small Arms Misuse in Central \nAmerica\u2019, Small Arms Survey Occasional Paper No. 5, Geneva, Small Arms Survey, 2003 for a description of \narms collection activities throughout the region. \n32 D.

D. Rodgers, \u2018Living in the Shadow of Death: Violence, Pandillas, and Social Disintegration in \nContemporary Urban Nicaragua\u2019 (note 2). There is evidence to suggest that this is not quite as clear-cut in the \ncase of maras, which are widely reported to have gang members ranging up to 30 years old, and from which it is \nsaid to be very difficult to \u201cretire\u201d (see Demoscop\u00eda, Maras y pandillas, comunidad y polic\u00eda en Centroam\u00e9rica \n(note 2); International Human Rights Clinic, No Place to Hide: Gang, State, and Clandestine Violence in El \nSalvador (Massachusetts: Human Rights Program, Harvard Law School, 2007). \n36 The origins of the word \u201cmara\u201d are unclear. It has been widely suggested that it is derived from the word \n\u201cmarabunta\u201d, a term used to describe a particularly vicious species of ants in certain South American countries. \nThe fact that this does not include El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras makes it an unlikely proposition, \nalthough considering the US origins of the maras, it might be speculated that the term derives from the classic \nUS horror film \u201cThe Naked Jungle\u201d (1954), in which an army of marabunta ants devastate a plantation in Brazil \ndespite the best efforts of Charlton Heston, which was remade for television in the early 1980s. This is purely \nspeculative, although it is interesting to note that this putative link was also mentioned in the first study of gangs \never carried out in Central America (D. Levenson et al., \u2018Por s\u00ed mismos: Un estudio preliminar des las \u201cmaras\u201d \n 19\n                                                                                                                                                        \nen la ciudad de Guatemala\u2019, Cuaderno de Investigaci\u00f3n no. 4, Asociaci\u00f3n para el Avance de las Ciencias \nSociales en Guatemala, Guatemala, 1988). \n37 USAID, Central America and Mexico Gangs Assessment, (Washington, DC: United States Agency for \nInternational Development, 2006), pp.18-19. \n38 Ibid, pp.18-19. \n39 This seems to have occurred almost universally in El Salvador and Honduras, but there still exist more \nlocalised maras in Guatemala, whose origins go back to the mid-1980s, and who are arguably closer in nature to \npandillas (see D. Levenson et al., \u2018Por s\u00ed mismos\u2019(note 2); E.C. Ranum, \u2018Diagn\u00f3stico Nacional Guatemala\u2019, \nProyecto \u201cPandillas juveniles transnacionales en Centroam\u00e9rica, M\u00e9xico y Estados Unidos\u201d, Centro de Estudios \ny Programas Interamericanos (CEPI) del Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico (ITAM), 2006, available \nonline at: http:\/\/interamericanos.itam.mx\/maras\/docs\/Diagnostico_Guatemala.pdf). The general trend, however, \nis for these to be increasingly absorbed within Dieciocho and Salvatrucha mara structures (see D. DeCesare, \n\u2018The Story of Edgar Bola\u00f1os\u2019, in L. Kontos, D. C. Brotherton, and L. Barrios (eds), Gangs and Society: \nAlternative Perspectives (New York: Columbia University Press, 2003). According to Demoscop\u00eda, Maras y \npandillas, comunidad y polic\u00eda en Centroam\u00e9rica (note 3), pp.49, deportee gang members are becoming a \nminority as the rate of deportation from the US declines, and are taking on more \u201cveteran\u201d roles, influencing \nmara behaviour through their prestige rather than actually taking part in gang activities. \n40 J.-L. Rocha, \u2018Pandilleros del siglo XXI\u2019 (note 2). \n41 According to C.M. Ribando, \u2018Report for Congress: Gangs in Central America\u2019, Congressional Research \nService, report RL34112, 2 August (2007), pp.1-2: \u201cGangs are generally considered to be distinct from organized \ncriminal organisations because they typically lack the hierarchical leadership structure, capital, and manpower \nrequired to run a sophisticated criminal enterprise. Gangs are generally more horizontally organized, with lots of \nsmall subgroups and no central leadership setting strategy and enforcing discipline. Although some gangs are \ninvolved in the street-level distribution of drugs, few gangs or gang members are involved in higher-level \ncriminal drug distribution enterprises run by drug cartels, syndicates, or other sophisticated criminal \norganisations\u201d. As Geoff Thale, the Research Director of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), has \ntestified before the US Congress, gangs are just one example of a whole spectrum of violence in Central \nAmerica, which also includes intra-familial violence, street crime, politically-motivated crimes, drug-related \nviolence, traditional organized crime, state violence, and human rights violations (cited in: C.M. Ribando, \n\u2018Report for Congress\u2019 (note 2), pp.3. \n42 M. Santacruz Giralt and A. Concha-Eastman, Barrio Adentro, (note 2). \n43 On 15 August 2005, newly imprisoned members of the Dieciocho mara attacked members of the Mara \nSalvatrucha in El Hoyon prison near Guatemala City, killing 30 and leaving more than twice that number \nseriously wounded. A retaliatory attack by members of the Salvatrucha in the San Jos\u00e9 Pinula juvenile detention \ncentre on 19 September 2005 killed at least 12 and wounded another ten. \n44 International Human Rights Clinic, No Place to Hide (note 2); D.

See J.-L. Rocha, \u2018Mapping the labyrinth \nfrom within\u2019 (note 2). Even if overall the Police response to gangs has not been as violent as in other Central \nAmerican countries, partly because of the less violent nature of the pandillas compared to the maras. \n54 See F. Faux, Les Maras, Gangs d\u2019Enfants : Violences urbaines en Am\u00e9rique Centrale (Paris : Autrement, \n2006).   \n55 The Merida Initiative was launched following US President George W.

The Central American \nCoalition for the Prevention of Youth Violence (CCPVJ) has shown that Mano Dura policies can be linked to a \ndramatic surge in youth violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras \u2013 up to 40 per cent in the first three \nyears of implementation (R.

Sen (eds), Global Vigilantes \n(London: Hurst, 2007). \n61 Rodgers, unpublished research. Another reason for the decline in pandillerismo is that the rise of these \ncriminal organisations has left no sociological \u201cspace\u201d for youth gangs. \n62 See M. Glenny, McMafia: Crime Without Frontiers (London: Random House, 2008). \n63 See, for example, N. Colletta and R. Muggah, \u2018Rethinking Post-War Security Promotion\u2019, Journal of Security \nSector Management, (Winter 2009), for a review of first and second generation policies. \n64 In Honduras, organisations like London-based Amnesty International and Casa Alianza have also reported that \ndeath squads are killing youngsters suspected of belonging to gangs, often merely because they sport tattoos. The \nNGO Casa Alianza has documented 2,778 murders of young people below the age of 23 between 1998 and July \n2008. Most of the victims were members of maras. Because these murders are usually not investigated, the \nperpetrators enjoy total impunity.\n65 See D. Rodgers, R. Muggah, and C.
