The software we describe represents a typic l \nBritish primary school for use in training Information and Communications Technology \n(ICT) co-ordinators at primary level. By documenting our ongoing evaluation of both \nthis resource and the technologies used in its implementation, we provide a tailed \ndescription of the production process of a prototype piece of software. This highlights t e \nimportance of pedagogy, new technologies and project management, and should be of \nparticular interest to multimedia designers and academics preparing to develop \ninnovative learning applications. \nIntroduction \nThe original concept was to create a 'simulation' which would provide trainee teachers, \nspecializing in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) with the opportunity \nto explore a primary school environment. Within the simulation, factors affecting the \ndevelopment and implementation f ICT would be modelled so that trainees would be able \nto develop the skills, knowledge and understanding ecessary to identify appropriate \nstrategies to overcome the limitations. To this end, we have developed Allsorts Primary -\nthe prototype of a simulated interactive nvironment, representing a typical primary \nschool. \nThe application is accessible via the Internet and presents the user with a virtual school \nthat can be examined room by room, using the mouse or keyboard. There are thirteen \nmembers of staff in the school, and users can watch pre-recorded video interviews with \n50 \nAIt-J Volume 9 Number I \nthese people, as well as reading all the paper documentation that relates to their enquiries \nand is normally found on the premises. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of a classroom in the \nvirtual school. \nFigure I: AIIsorts Primary dassroom. \nIn this paper we will explain the reasons behind making certain fundamental decisions \nregarding the nature of this software as well as providing a detailed description of the \nproduction process, following the stages of our design to show how we reached \nconclusions. The aim is to provide an overview of the development lifecycle of a bespoke \nlearning resource, demonstrating the fusion of pedagogical aims, interface design \nprinciples and state-of-the-art technology. The process was collaborative and iterative, with \nthe actual specification and design of the software running in parallel, one informing the \nother. A comprehensive evaluation of the finished product will be carried out later in 2001 \nby second year B.Ed. students at the University of North London and by a focus group at \nKingston University, whose feedback and learning experience will be reported separately. \nSpecification \nRationale \nAll B.Ed. students attending the University of North London choose a specialist subject to \nstudy on completion of their first year in initial teacher training for the primary phase. The \nspecialist pathway consists of five modules, and for ICT specialists, the last of these focuses \non the role of the ICT co-ordinator. \nAny subject co-ordinator is expected to produce documentation such as policies and \nschemes of work which identify how the subject is viewed and taught within the school. In \naddition to this, issues central to the role of a co-ordinator include staff training, purchase \nand allocation of new resources, monitoring and evaluating the provision, delivery and \nassessment of the subject area in question, as well as planning for future developments \n(Briggs, 1997: 5). Organizational and communication skills are clearly necessary and, \nperhaps more importantly, interpersonal skills in order to develop a shared goal amongst \nthe staff within the school. The co-ordinator of any subject faces a complex role. \n51 \nFiono French et al The specification and design of an interactive virtual environment for use in teacher training \nFor the ICT co-ordinator, this role may be more challenging because of the diversity of \nstaff expertise, attitudes and range of equipment within the school. As it is a cross- \ncurricular subject, it is necessary for the ICT co-ordinator to communicate effectively with \nother subject co-ordinators: ICT cannot be taught in isolation. \nThe fast-developing area of ICT requires asubstantial mount of time devoted to learning \nabout new technologies and their impact upon teaching and learning (Harrison, 1998: 10). \nConsequently, using multimedia technology to provide some of the resource material for \nthis subject area is very appropriate. Trainees will be expected to regard the software \ncritically and provide useful feedback for the developers. \nThe final module for ICT specialists aims to address the skills, knowledge and \nunderstanding ecessary for the successful co-ordination of this curriculum area. It is \ndifficult to control the learning experiences of trainees, who are placed in schools where \ntime is scarce and there may be unwillingness on the part of the staff to discuss a sensitive \nissue. While in some respects, it could be argued that this is the 'real world experience', \ninappropriate or inadequate placements could also be detrimental to the trainee's \ndevelopment asa potential co-ordinator f ICT. \nAllsorts Primary aims to alleviate this problem by offering all trainees the same school \nenvironment and ample opportunity o discuss the issues affecting the development of ICT \nwithin that school. Thus, it incorporates key aspects of Laurillard's teaching-learning \nmodel (Laurillard, 1994): the discussion of relevant concepts involving tutor and trainees; \na 'tutor-constructed world' designed to initiate reflection; trainees' interaction with this \nand subsequent experiential knowledge. In addition, electronic delivery enables trainees to \ninteract with the resource from a distance. Therefore, they can take their time to browse the \nvirtual school in the role of an ICT co-ordinator, interacting with various media in order to \nassess the current situation without he unrealistic pressure of performing under scrutiny \nin a classroom. This should provide them with the necessary data to construct an ICT \ndevelopment plan for the whole school. \nTutor's brief \nThe original concept of an interactive, virtual school stems from a need to create a \ncontrolled learning environment where trainee co-ordinators can explore schools with \npredetermined specifications. It involves creating a range of teacher personalities and a \nvariety of school environments. The intention is to select from a 'resource bank' of teachers \nand schools in order to generate complex situations which currently exist in primary schools \nin terms of ICT. By being able to select he variables, for example 'teacher attitude towards \ninformation technology', the tutor can direct the attention of the trainees to the specific \nskills, knowledge and understanding required for the successful co-ordination of ICT. \nThe use of visual and audio cues is important in order to make the experience as realistic as \npossible whilst reflecting Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence by using a variety of \nstimuli to support learning (Gardner, 1993). Data presented through such media carries more \ninformation, for example, facial expression, intonation and non-verbal communication. \nTo simulate the role of the co-ordinator, the trainee needs to interact with the staff by asking \nquestions and exploring the school to examine the provision for ICT in terms of available \nsoftware and hardware. Furthermore, if the trainee can investigate the equipment in each \n52 \nAIt-j Volume 9 Number I \nclassroom to determine whether it is in working order and the amount o f  use it has had, it \nwill provide a more complete picture of the implementation f ICT within the school. \nBy providing access to such a resource outside directed teaching time, the possibilities of \nemploying a variety of teaching approaches becomes more realistic. Trainees can return to \nthe resource whenever they have access to the Internet and interview staff as many times as \nthey wanL During taught sessions, the tutor can organize the trainees into pairs, groups or \nrequest hat they work independently. The role of the software is not that of a tutor but as \na resource which enhances the teaching and learning experience. Trainees are able to take \ncontrol of their own learning, interacting with the data presented and scaffolding their own \nlearning through discussions related to the school simulation (Vygotsky, cited in Ager 1998: \n18; Tiffin and Rajasingham, 1995: 54). The focus, therefore, is on what they learn rather \nthan what they remember (Ramsden, 1992: 41). \nInterviews can be repeated, rooms revisited and tasks redone as many times as required. \nFigure 2 shows a still from a video interview. Trainees are expected to make notes on paper \nin real time as they explore the school, just as they would in real life. Ideally, the program \nshould keep track of the trainee's movements, o that teachers in the school appear to \nknow if the user is interviewing them for the first time, in which case an introductory \ngreeting occurs. \nFigure 2: Interview with a member \nof  staff. \nThe school also features ome random and apparently spontaneous incidents; for example, \nperiodically a small boy tears past and rushes out into the playground. There is a \nbackground soundtrack taken from a real school environment. Trainees can also interview \nchildren in each class. The documentation sometimes has coffee stains that enhance realism \nand the sense that the paper has been passed around the staff room. \nDesign criteria \nThe creation of an original piece of multimedia courseware requires thorough and \nrigorous planning in order to make best use of available resources, such as hardware, \nsoftware, skills and knowledge. These are some of the issues that arose and questions that \nwe asked ourselves. \n53 \nFiona French et al The specification and design of an interactive virtual environment for use in teacher training \nPedagogical Issues \nRobe of technology \nActivities \nLearning \nNavigation \nQuality \n\u2022 Does it help to engage and motivate the user? \n\u2022 Classify as presentations, interactive animations, self-assessments, problem- \nsolving exercises or simulations. \n\u2022 What kind of learning is taking place? \n\u2022 Consider different styles of learning, as this may have an impact on \nnavigational freedom. \n\u2022 Do students have a clear task to accomplish, or is this a resource to \nbrowse \nat leisure? \n\u2022 Is material contextualized? \n\u2022 Are the routes through the material prescribed or marked? \n\u2022 What degree of quality will users expect? \n\u2022 How realistic is it? \n\u2022 Will this be a motivating factor? \nTable I: Some pedagogical considerations for interactive learning resources, \nFactors Influencing \nTime \u2022 \nSkills \nShelf Life \nDelivery \u2022 \nEvaluation \u2022 \nBudget \u2022 \nProduction \nEstimate development time accurately, \nEnsure good project management through sensible planning. \nWhat existing skills are available? \nDo developers want an opportunity to learn new skills? \nAim to keep product flexible to facilitate changes. \nCan software be updated easily? \nCan software be reused in different contexts? \nWhat is the minimum specification of the end-user's computer? \nIs the application Web-based? \nDoes the content stream? \nWhat complications arise from networked distribution? \nWho will test the prototype? \nWhen will staff or students be available? \nWhat kind of feedback is required? \nHow do we aim to collect it? \nWhat are the costs in terms of hardware, software and services? \nWill training for developers be necessary? \nTable 2: Factors influencing the development life cycle. \nInterface design \nA good interface enables the user to engage with and control the information presented by \nthe computer. Mullet and Sano (1995) claim that users will discard any interface that \nappears boring or confusing, and Mandel (1997) emphasizes the benefits of a seductive \ndesign, although for him, navigation is the key to the experience from the user's point of \nview. \nGraham (1998) refers to use of icons, stylistic onventions, consistency and controls in her \nevaluation of navigational schemes. In designing the interface for the virtual primary \n54 \nAI\u00a2:-] Volume 9 Number I \nschool, the intention was that it should at all times be clear to the user what actions can be \ntaken, without the need to resort to a user manual. In order to facilitate ease of use, a \nnumber of principles were considered, which an be categorized as follows: \n\u2022 Consistency. In order that the user should quickly become familiar with the completed \ninterface design, the design should be consistent across all screens of the \nimplementation. Users will then be able to build an accurate mental model of how the \nsystem works (Ambler, 1998). One of Mandel's golden rules (1997) is to reduce the load \non the user's memory by relying on recognition rather than recall, and by \ncontextualizing and organizing information. \n\u2022 Simplicity. An economical style is an elegant solution to the problem of interface \ndesign. When it is effective, use becomes transparent and the design itself disappears - \nthe ultimate reality for the user becomes the representation (Laurel, 1993). \n\u2022 Changes of state. Jones and Oakey (1995) define changes in state as effects used to \nprovide users with a cue that a particular action is taking place. In order to avoid the \nuser gaining the impression that their mouse-click has not been recognized, or that the \ncomputer has ceased to function correctly, it is important o provide immediate \nfeedback for each user action. This could take the form of a cursor shape change, a \nsound or the opening of a new window. If there is to be a delay at any time, there \nshould be reassurance in the form of an indication that the user must wait. \n\u2022 Metaphors. A software interface metaphor is an emulation of a real life system or \nmodel to allow the user to act intuitively with that software. Microsoft Windows, for \nexample, uses a desktop metaphor, allowing the user's onscreen workspace to contain \nfiles, folders, documents, a trash can and so on. Such features provide clear affordances \n(that is, the perceived properties of the objects) that are easily understood by the user \n(Norman, 1992). By using a metaphor with which the user is already familiar, the \ninterface designer aims to maximize the user's understanding of how the interface \nmight function. The interface designed and implemented in Allsorts Primary uses a \nmap metaphor. The user is presented with a plan of the school ayout. By clicking on a \nparticular classroom, the user is taken to that room, and allowed to explore it. As the \ntarget user group are is fairly well defined, we feel (subject o testing) that this metaphor \nwill prove to be intuitive. \nColour. When using colour within a user interface, it is important to be aware of users' \npreconceptions. Although there can be some cultural variation, certain colours have \nrecognized meanings or moods attached to them (Shneiderman, 1992). For this reason, \nred and green have been used where confirmatory choices are to be made, green being \nused to reinforce 'yes' or 'ok', red reinforcing 'no' or 'cancel'. The way in which the \nhuman eye perceives and absorbs colour information is also an important \nconsideration for the interface designer. We have avoided text and background colour \ncombinations such as red\/blue, yellow\/purple and magenta\/green as they are difficult to \nread. \nAccessibility. Equality of opportunity and accessibility for all students is important. \nAlternatives to some media-rich online materials hould be provided for students who \nhave auditory or visual impairment. In our case, this involves providing subtitles for \n55 \nFiona French et al The specification and design of an interactive virtual environment for use in teacher training \nvideo interviews and providing a text-based equivalent for the visual interactive \npresentation. \nProgramming variables \nEssentially, the software developer has to deconstruct the user's experience (as described in \nthe specification of the application above) into a set of functions and blocks of data, in \norder to specify the components hat will be used to build a virtual model. \nModern software design uses an object-orientated paradigm, aiming to create discrete \nmodules that work together, but can be updated independently. This principle extends to \nthe separation of data and functionality, in order to keep programming code reusable in a \nvariety of contexts. For the model of the school, we identified the following as variables: \n\u2022 available resources - hardware and software; \n\u2022 s ta f f -  their skilts and attitudes; \n\u2022 current management plans and budget; \n\u2022 rooms - fittings, furniture, children's work etc. \nThe user controls the presentation of information in various media, thus the GUI (graphical \nuser interface) provides the main functionality. The user does not input data, so the computer \nperforms no calculations in this prototype. At a later stage we hope to build a more \nsophisticated model that can randomly generate a school from a limited set of variables. \nVirtual reality and multimedia \n'The notion of virtual reality is a continuum that is older even than science fiction' (Laurel \n1993: 189). Ghost stories told round the campfire, Ancient Greek dramas and Playstations \nall share a common goal, which is to heighten audience experience through multi-sensory \nrepresentation. Our cognitive and perceptual systems are capable of receiving input \nsimultaneously from different senses. While a many-coded meaning is stronger and more \nmemorable than one that derives from only one sense (Gross, 1987), repeated stimulation \nusually dulls the senses into habituation, suggesting that a degree of restraint is in order. In \ndeveloping Allsorts Primary, we aim to simulate for the trainee the experience of being an \nICT co-ordinator. Laurillard defines a simulation as a model of an aspect of the world \nwhich allows the user to make some input, run the model and then display the result (1993: \n132). Laurel (1993) and Murray (1997) envisage the computer as an interactive immersive \nenvironment, choreographed like a piece of theatre and incorporating multimedia elements \nand intelligent agents to help the user role-play and explore a virtual world. Our virtual \nschool is essentially a sophisticated presentation, in which the choice of media should \ncontribute to the trainees' engagement with the software and consequent motivation. \nWhich meclla? \nChoice of delivery methods is an important factor early in the development life cycle, in \nour case largely determined by the functionality and shelf life of the proposed software. In \norder to extend the life and usefulness of Allsorts Primary, it was decided to aim for online \ndelivery, rather than copying the school software to CD-ROM. The advantage of \nnetworked istribution is that the resource can be updated or changed and all the users \n(clients) immediately benefit. \n56 \nAIt-j Volume 9 Number I \nWhile Web delivery frees the developer from producing a finite product, it also imposes \ncertain restrictions regarding functionality. Most of these are the result of congestion on \nthe network or narrow bandwidths reducing the speed at which data can be sent or \nreceived. The effects are most obvious when presenting a large amount of graphical data, \nsuch as video clips or 3D environments. \nWhen creating the virtual school, we explored the possibility of three-dimensionality on \nscreen. It was felt that 3D navigation gives a strong sense of engagement with the \nenvironment and we looked at several emerging technologies that deliver this experience with \nvarying degrees of success. Cosmo Player and Anfy3D delivers VRML content at high \nresolution but require the user to download a player to their computer. The VRML files are \ntoo large for home users to view quickly, but 3DML can be delivered much faster using the \nFlatland Rover 2 plugin. However, the format only allows for one item per 256 pixel cube. \nThis means that detail is limited and therefore not suitable for our classroom environments. \nShout3D applets deliver Java3D, which looks good but offers limited interactivity. \nIn order to try these technologies, the classroom was initially modeled in 3D Studio so that \nit could be exported as a 3D file. An alternative would be to use actual video footage of a \nreal school. Howevel, navigation then potentially becomes a problem. As the content of \nevery video clip is predetermined, users inevitably become more passive. Another \ndrawback is file size - the quality of video required to show sufficient detail would take too \nlong to download over the Internet. \nOur compromise was to build an interactive panorama, a commonly used device for \npresenting virtual tours of places and buildings. Each space is viewed from a central point \nwith the camera eye seeming to rotate 360 degrees. The user controls the direction and \nmagnification and can move from one panorama to another via hot links, Relevant objects \ncan become hot areas, so that they (in our case, hardware devices) can be clicked to reveal \nmore information. A soundtrack can also be added to each classroom. The panorama is \nbuilt from a 360 degree flat graphical representation of the classroom (see Figure 3), \npresented as a HotMedia applet embedded in a Web page. \nFigure 3 :360  degree panoramic jpeg image. \nThe time taken to develop the initial 3D model was slightly underestimated, although \nsubsequent classrooms could be more quickly developed as many of the resources have \nalready been created and can be reused. However, on reflection, we have decided to create \nthe rest of the Allsorts environment using panoramic photographs taken on the premises \nof a real primary school. This is mainly to save time, but also because we felt that we were \nnot able to exploit fully the three-dimensionality online. A drawback may be the cost of \nhiring suitable camera equipment and software. \n57 \nFiono French et al The specification and design of an interactive virtual environment for use in teacher training \nIt was felt hat for the sake of realism, the interviews would need to be video, rather than \naudio presented with a photograph, or animation. Three main technologies dominate Web \nvideo delivery - RealMedia, Apple Quicktime and Windows Media. While RealMedia nd \nQuicktime work cross-platform, each requires the purchase and implementation f server \nsoftware to stream the data effectively. Microsoft's Windows Streaming Server is free, \nexcept hat like the others, it uses up the provider's bandwidth and requires a dedicated \nmachine. Cost will eventually be the over-riding factor, but for our initial prototype we \nhave used RealMedia nd Quicktime. The RealPlayer is a standard plugin on most modern \ncomputers and can deliver synchronized multimedia integration language (SMIL), which \nenables a transcript of the teacher's answer to be delivered in RealText simultaneously with \nthe appropriate video clip. The interview streams and plays in real time. Users can then \nscroll to different sections to replay. \nFigure 4: Filming in the television studios. \nThe Quicktime version utilizes a plugin embedded on a Web page. The list of interview \nquestions i presented in HTML with buttons that launch the relevant answer movie clip. \nThe first virtual teacher was filmed in the University of North London television studios \nagainst a blue screen background. The profile of the character had been prepared and a \nscript of answers was available, although we were hoping for a spontaneous approach by \nthe actor. In the editing phase, the blue screen was removed and replaced with a still from \nthe virtual classroom, giving the impression that the teacher is part of the scene. \nIt is worth noting the number of people required to make a small-scale video, as well as the \nhardware and space provision. Figure 4 shows an interview being filmed in the studio; \nparticipants include the actress playing the teacher's role, the script-writer\/prompter, the\ndirector, the camera-person a d lighting crew. Post-production time involving capturing \nand editing is also significant. \nThe fictional documentation to accompany the software consisted of the following: \n\u2022 a recent OFSTED report; \n\u2022 a scheme of work showing an overview of progression and continuity across and \nthrough the years; \n\u2022 a school IT Policy document; \n\u2022 information about he aims of the software and instructions on how to use the resources. \n58 \nAIt-] Volume 9 Number I \nWe felt it was important to maintain the material in its original paper-based format, rather \nthan choosing to deliver it via a computer, in order to enhance the realism. Back-up copies \nwill be available online, either for updating documents or to replace lost ones. \nConclusions \nThe development of Allsorts Primary has relied on the collaboration of people with \ndifferent skill sets, a certain amount of shared knowledge and a shared enthusiasm for \ntechnology and innovative ducational practice. While the ultimate goal is to produce an \neffective and motivating resource for tutors and trainees, the process of designing in a team \nhas its own rewards, in terms of cross-fertilization f ideas, growth of knowledge and \ndevelopment of the skills required to realize the concept. \nAlthough the use of technology has many advantages, there ate limitations that need to be \nacknowledged when using such an approach for teaching and learning. The interaction \nbetween a virtual teacher and a trainee is shaped by the predetermined questions selected \nduring the design of the resource. Because of this, the data gathered by the trainee is\nlimited to the questions and answers selected by the designer. Additional questions, which \nare possible during a real interview, are clearly not possible in the virtual school described \nin this study. Non-verbal communication can be identified through the use of video \nfootage, incorporated within the structure of the resource, but this is limited to the distance \nand clarity of the images provided. If the images and sound are of sufficiently good \nquality, it will be possible for the trainees to identify important visual and auditory cues \nwhich will enhance the ensuing discussion. Although genuine human interaction i volving \nnegotiation and interpersonal relationships i  not possible, the application will be \nintegrated within a wider programme where such issues will be addressed. \nThere are also limitations regarding the reality of the school and the rooms within. \nAlthough the visual images provide a representation f a three-dimensional environment, \nit does not replace the experience of physically exploring an actual school. \nDespite these limitations, the application does provide a rich teaching and learning \nresource which, if used in conjunction with the real-life school experience, combines the \nstrengths of each. For example, a session could focus on particular issues that can then be \nstudied in depth; such a structured class is not possible in the school environment. \nThe prototype version of Allsorts Primary contains one clearly defined school with an \nestablished cast of teachers and fulfils the minimum requirements of the original brief. We \nhope that eventually each user will have a unique experience, as a more sophisticated \nprogram generates a random school from a finite list of variable factors (staff, resources, \nenvironment). This means that the user can attempt the simulation again and visit an \nAllsorts Primary with a completely different set of values and resources. Alternatively, \ngroups of trainees can visit each others' schools and give feedback on each others' reports. \nAt present, all feedback comes from the tutor on submission of the trainee's appraisal of \nthe school, not from the program itself. \nThis project has followed a typical software development life cycle. The evaluation process \nhas started with our own ongoing assessment of the project and the product, and it will \ncontinue as we collect feedback from students and staff at the associated institutions. The \n59 \nFtona French et al The specification and design of  an interactive virtual environment for use in teacher training \nreflective nature of the process of designing an innovative resource nables this project o \nbecome a learning experience for the participants and for others who are contemplating \nmaterials development, aswe endeavour to make full use of the latest echnology in order \nto deliver a stimulating product. \nReferences \nAger, R.
