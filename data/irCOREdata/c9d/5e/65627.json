Such research draws\nstrongly, though usually implicitly, on welfare state\ntheories and concepts. In this glossary, we explicitly\ndefine these concepts in order to enable more\nresearchers, practitioners and policy-makers to engage\nwith and contribute to this exciting and fruitful area of\npublic health research.\nAlthough it has long been acknowledged that\nsocial policies and the nature and extent of welfare\nstate provision are important determinants of\nhealth and health inequalities, as they mediate\nthe extent and impact of the socioeconomic\nposition on health,1\u20134 it is not until recently that\nsocial epidemiologists have started to systemati-\ncally examine how different national welfare state\narrangements influence international variations in\npopulation health.5\u201315 Such comparative social\nepidemiology increasingly utilises welfare state\nregime theory, which classifies welfare states into\ndifferent types (or regimes), depending on the\nprinciples underpinning their provision, the relative\nrole of the state as opposed to the market or the\nfamily and the nature of social stratification.16\nSomewhat invariably, these \u2018\u2018regime\u2019\u2019 studies have\nall concluded that population health is enhanced,\nand inequalities in health reduced, by the relatively\ngenerous and universal welfare provision of the\nSocial Democratic countries.6 7 12 14\nHowever, despite the burgeoning nature of this\nresearch and the increasing attention it receives\nfrom policy-makers (for example, the European\nUnion funded the EUROTHINE study, http:\/\/\nmgzlx4.erasmusmc.nl\/eurothine\/), nowhere in the\npublic health literature are the key terms related to\nthe welfare state explicitly defined. Many terms\nare used implicitly, with the assumption that those\nwho wish to access and use the research are already\nin the know. Given the specific and, sometimes,\nhistorical nature of much of the terminology (for\nexample, decommodification, social transfers, etc),\nwe believe that this is actually highly unlikely and\nthat subsequently, the current audience for such\nresearch is being artificially limited. Furthermore,\nuntil this conceptual gap is closed, it is unlikely\nthat the public health community will be able to\nrespond adequately to recent calls for more\nresearch into the relations between welfare states\nand health.15 17\nTherefore, in this glossary, we outline those\nwelfare state-related terms that are most fre-\nquently used, but so seldom defined, within social\nepidemiological studies. We hope that it will be a\ntool that enables more researchers, practitioners\nand policy-makers to engage with and contribute\nto this exciting and fruitful area of public health\nresearch. Words that are in italics are themselves\ndefined in the glossary. The terms are not in\nalphabetical order as those that relate conceptually\nor historically to one another are presented\nconsecutively. The glossary covers key terms and\nconcepts relating to welfare state provision, the\nhistorical development of the welfare state, and\ncross-national variations in welfare states in the\nform of welfare regimes. Links between the\nconcepts and public health are also made where\nappropriate.\nWELFARE STATE\nThe term welfare state was accepted in Scandinavia\nin the 1930s, but was only used more widely after\nthe second world war.18 However, there is still no\naccepted standard definition of this concept.19\nConventionally, it has been used in a narrow\nsense, as a means of referring to the various post-\nwar state measures for the provision of key welfare\nservices and social transfers. The welfare state is\nthereby used as a shorthand for the state\u2019s role in\neducation, health, housing, poor relief, social\ninsurance, in developed capitalist countries during\nthe post-war period.20 Public health services, such\nas health promotion, are also included within this\ndefinition.\nWELFARE STATE CAPITALISM\nThis term reflects a view of the welfare state as a\nparticular type of state and a specific form of\nsociety. In this way, the emergence of the post-war\nwelfare state is regarded as a shift towards a new\nform (or forms\u2014see welfare state regimes) of\ncapitalist economy in which, following Keynesian\neconomic theory, there is an emphasis on full\n(male) employment, universalism and corporatist\npartnership.21 22 The Keynesian economic theory\nhas full employment as priority and sees govern-\nment intervention in the economy as necessary for\nmanaging economic stability. Welfare state capital-\nism is most widely associated with Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s modern classic The Three Worlds of\nWelfare Capitalism (1990), in which the welfare\nstate is not just a set of social transfers and welfare\nservices that are used to intervene in, and possibly\ncorrect, the structure of inequality.16 It is, in its\nown right, a system of social stratification, because\nthe way in which the welfare state distributes\nwelfare services has consequences for the social and\neconomical hierarchy in society. More specifically,\nthe welfare state actively (re-)organises social\nrelations through the way in which it deliberately\nmodifies market forces by guaranteeing citizens\nand families a minimum income (see social citizenship\nGlossary\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:3\u20136. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.066787 3\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nor decommodification) and by reducing the welfare responsibilities of\nthe family (see defamilisation). Comparative social epidemiology,\nwhich examines the influence of welfare state arrangements, is\noften concerned with comparing the effects on population health\nof the social stratifications created by different types of welfare\nstates (see welfare state regimes).5\u201315\nGOLDEN AGE OF WELFARE\nThe golden age of welfare refers to the classic welfare state, which\nwas established across Europe shortly after the second world\nwar and lasted until the crisis of the welfare state in the 1970s.23\u201325\nThe golden age ended with the economic crisis of the 1970s (high\ninflation, slow economic growth, the end of full employment)\nduring which there was a general loss of confidence in welfare\nstate capitalism (initially in the United States and United\nKingdom and then across continental Europe).26\u201328 The classic\nwelfare state was based on two main mechanisms. Firstly, it was\nfounded on a cradle-to-grave public universalism, both in terms\nof coverage of the population and the range of welfare services\nthat were provided. Secondly, in following Keynesian econom-\nics to a greater (for example, France) or lesser extent (for\nexample, United Kingdom), it attempted to maintain full (male)\nemployment.23 In this period, Europe saw significant improve-\nments to public housing, health care and the other main social\ndeterminants of health. Corresponding improvements in mortality\nand morbidity were experienced although, despite the achieve-\nments of welfare states in improving equality of opportunity, there\nis ample evidence that important health inequalities still exist.29\nWELFARE STATE RETRENCHMENT\nA political welfare backlash followed the crisis of the welfare state\nand the term welfare state retrenchment is used to refer to the\nsubsequent welfare state reforms and cuts to social expenditure.\nThe reforms were characterised by the privatisation and\nmarketisation of welfare services (for example, the purchaser\/\nprovider split in national health systems such as Sweden and\nthe United Kingdom)30 31; entitlement restrictions and increased\nqualifying conditions (for example, the population coverage of\nunemployment benefit in the United Kingdom decreased from\n90% in 1980 to 77% in 1999; in Germany it decreased from\n100% to 84%, and in Norway, from 100% to 79%),32\u201334 and a\nshift towards targeting and means testing (for example, the\nsetting of income limits for the receipt of family allowances in\nItaly and Spain); cuts or limited increases to the actual cash\nvalues of social transfers (for example, in the United Kingdom,\nthe replacement value of unemployment benefit decreased from\n45% of average wages in 1980 to just 16% in 1999; in Germany\nit decreased from 68% to 37%, and in Norway from 70% to\n62%)32 33; modified funding arrangements (with a shift away\nfrom corporate insurance contributions and business taxation);\nand an increased emphasis on an active rather than a passive\nwelfare system (for example, by tying the receipt of benefits to\ntraining as is the case in Scandinavia).34 Although initially\nlimited to the United Kingdom and the United States, these\nprocesses are now commonplace across all welfare state regimes,\nalthough the nature and extent of welfare state retrenchment is\nlimited by the structures of the prevailing welfare state system\nand is therefore to some extent path dependent.35\u201337 Reforms of\nthis nature are considered by some to have lessened the\ninfluence of the welfare state in moderating the relation between\nmarket position and health, and has thereby led to increased\nhealth inequalities in some countries, most notably the United\nKingdom.4\nWELFARE STATE REGIMES\nAccording to Esping-Andersen,16 the welfare states of different\ncountries can be classified, on the basis of decommodification,\nsocial stratification and the private-public mix of welfare\nprovision (the relative roles of the state, the family, the\nvoluntary sector and the market in welfare provision), into\nthree different groups or welfare state regimes: Liberal,\nConservative and Social Democratic (box 1). Subsequent\ndebates about the validity and composition of Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s original welfare state regimes typology has led to the\nproduction of competing classifications and the identification of\nother possible regime types: Radical, Southern, Confucian, and\nEastern European (box 1).15 38 A significant body of work has\nexamined how population health and health inequalities vary\nby welfare state regime, with most concluding that health fares\nbest in the Social Democratic welfare states.5\u201315\nDECOMMODIFICATION\nDecommodification was one of the major factors used in the\ncomposition of Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology of welfare state\nregimes.16 Essentially, it is the extent to which individuals and\nfamilies can maintain a normal and socially acceptable standard\nof living regardless of their market performance.16 35\nCommodification, on the other hand, refers to the extent to\nwhich workers and their families are reliant upon the market\nsale of their labour. Labour became extensively commodified\nduring the industrial revolution as workers became entirely\ndependent upon the market for their survival.16 35 In the 20th\ncentury, social citizenship brought about a \u2018\u2018loosening\u2019\u2019 of the\npure commodity status of labour. The welfare state decom-\nmodified labour because certain services and a certain standard\nof living became a right of citizenship and reliance on the\nmarket for survival decreased. However, it must be noted that\nunder welfare state capitalism, while the pure commodification of\nlabour is possible, its pure decommodification is not.39 The issue\nunder study is therefore the relative degrees of protection from\ndependence on the labour market provided by different welfare\nstates. Recent public health research has found a positive\nrelation between levels of decommodification, income inequality\nand measures of population health such as infant mortality\nrates.12 14\nDEFAMILISATION\nDefamilisation is often defined as the degree to which individual\nadults can uphold a socially acceptable standard of living,\nindependently of family relationships, either through paid work\nor through social security provisions.40 This concept acknowl-\nedges that, often, the functional equivalent of market depen-\ndency for many women is family dependency.35 The concept has\nbeen operationalised by commentators as either the extent to\nwhich welfare states decommodify the family35 41 or the extent to\nwhich the welfare state enables women to survive as indepen-\ndent workers and decreases the economic importance of the\nfamily in women\u2019s lives.15 42 To date, comparative social\nepidemiology has not utilised the concept to examine gender\ndifferences in population health between countries. However,\nthere is a growing trend towards research that looks at the\ninfluence of welfare state arrangements on women\u2019s social roles\nand the differences between the health of men and women.43\u201346\nSOCIAL CITIZENSHIP\nCitizenship is a status bestowed on those who are full members\nof a community and all who possess the status are equal with\nGlossary\n4 J Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:3\u20136. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.066787\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nrespect to the rights and duties with which that status is\nendowed.25 47 Following Marshall (1963) there are three main\ncomponents of citizenship: civil and political, which refer to\nindividual freedoms and the right to participate in the exercise\nof political power, and social citizenship.47 Social citizenship is the\nright to economic and social welfare in accordance with the\nstandards prevailing in society.47 Health, or the \u2018\u2018right to a standard\nof living adequate for health and wellbeing,\u2019\u2019 is an important\naspect of social citizenship.48 49 In Europe, the welfare state has\nfunctioned as the embodiment of social citizenship as the\ndecommodification it provides ensures that a certain standard of\nliving (although these vary between countries\u2014see welfare state\nregimes) is a right of citizenship rather than something solely\nacquired via individual market position (for example, as a con-\nsumer). In this way, debates about welfare state retrenchment are also\nabout the extent and validity of the rights of social citizenship.\nUNIVERSALISM\nIn short, universalism means that social transfers and welfare\nservices (including healthcare services) are granted for everyone\non the basis of (social) citizenship. This implies that despite\nprevailing socioeconomic inequalities, every citizen is of equal\nworth within the welfare state.10 Universalism is most typically\nassociated with the Social Democratic welfare states since these\ncountries promote an equality of the highest standards of\nwelfare services and social transfers. However, some degree of\nuniversalism is also associated with those welfare states based on\nthe Beveridge model (for example, the National Health Service\nwithin the United Kingdom),25 albeit in these cases it is often an\nequality of a basic minimum. Approaches counter to the\nprinciples of universalism are means testing (in which entitle-\nment is restricted on the basis of income), targeting (that is,\nwhen benefit receipt is only available to the restricted groups,\noften the most impoverished) or workfare (in which participa-\ntion in employment or training is a condition of benefit\nentitlement).34\nSOCIAL TRANSFERS\nSocial transfers are interchangeably referred to in the literature as\nincome maintenance programmes, social security or cash\nBox 1: Welfare state regimes\nLiberal\/residual\nIn the welfare states of the liberal regime (United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Canada, Australia), state provision of welfare is minimal,\nsocial transfers are modest and often attract strict entitlement criteria; and recipients are usually means tested and stigmatised.16 In this\nmodel, the dominance of the market is encouraged both passively, by guaranteeing only a minimum, and actively, by subsidising private\nwelfare schemes.16 The liberal welfare state regime thereby minimises the decommodification effects of the welfare state and a stark\ndivision exists between those, largely the poor, who rely on state aid and those who are able to afford private provision.\nConservative\/corporatist\/Bismarckian\nThe conservative welfare state regime (Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Italy and, to a lesser extent, The Netherlands) is distinguished by\nits \u2018\u2018status differentiating\u2019\u2019 welfare programmes in which benefits are often earnings related, administered through the employer; and geared\ntowards maintaining existing social patterns. The role of the family is also emphasised and the redistributive impact is minimal. However,\nthe role of the market is marginalised.16\nSocial democratic\nThe Social Democratic regime type (Nordic countries) is characterised by universalism, comparatively generous social transfers, a\ncommitment to full employment and income protection; and a strongly interventionist state. The state is used to promote social equality\nthrough a redistributive social security system.52 Unlike the other welfare state regimes, the Social Democratic regime type promotes an\nequality of the highest standards, not an equality of minimal needs and it provides highly decommodifying programmes.16\nSouthern\nIt has been proposed that the southern European welfare states (Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain) comprise a distinctive, southern, welfare\nstate regime.53\u201355 The southern welfare states are described as \u2018\u2018rudimentary\u2019\u2019 because they are characterised by their fragmented system of\nwelfare provision, which consists of diverse income maintenance schemes that range from the meagre to the generous, and welfare\nservices, particularly the healthcare system, that provide only limited and partial coverage.54 Reliance on the family and voluntary sector is\nalso a prominent feature.\nRadical\/targeted\nCastles and Mitchell argue that the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand constitute a radical, targeted form of welfare state, one in\nwhich the welfare goals of poverty amelioration and income equality are pursued through redistributive instruments rather than by high\nexpenditure levels.56 In the same vein, Korpi and Palme describe the existence of a targeted welfare state regime.57\nConfucian\nThe Confucian welfare state (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) is characterised by low levels of government\nintervention and investment in social welfare, underdeveloped public service provision, and the fundamental importance of the family and\nvoluntary sector in providing social safety nets. This minimalist approach is combined with an emphasis on Confucian social ethics\n(obligation for immediate family members, thrift, diligence and a strong education and work ethic).58\nEastern European\nAccording to Esping-Andersen, these countries are clearly the most underdefined and understudied region in terms of welfare state\ndevelopment.35 The formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe have experienced extensive economic upheaval and have undertaken\nextensive social reforms throughout the 1990s.59 These have seen the demise of the universalism of the Communist welfare state and a shift\ntowards policies associated more with the liberal welfare state regime, notably marketisation and decentralisation. In comparison with the\nother member states of the European Union, they have limited health service provision and overall population health is relatively poor.60\nGlossary\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:3\u20136. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.066787 5\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nbenefits. They are the aspect of the welfare state most associated\nwith income redistribution\u2014for example, housing related\nbenefits, unemployment, pensions and sickness and disability\nbenefits. They are distinct from welfare services (health care,\neducation, social services, etc). There are five main types of\nsocial transfer: social insurance benefits (which are contribution\nbased and therefore earned entitlements), social assistance\n(often residual, means tested benefits for those who do not\nqualify for social insurance benefits), categorical benefits (paid\nto specific groups as long as the criteria are met\u2014for example,\nchild benefit in the United Kingdom), occupational benefits (for\nexample, sickness and disability pensions or maternity pay-\nments which are often administered by employers or other\nsocial partners) and fiscal transfers (tax allowances and reliefs\nsuch as the earned income tax credit in the United States or the\nworking tax credit in the United Kingdom).50 The relative value\nof social transfers as a replacement for wages (replacement rates,\nsee decommodification) varies across welfare states (with more\ngenerous levels provided by the Social Democratic welfare\nstates).16 In some systems they are related to previous earnings\n(for example, Norway, Germany), whereas in others they are\nprovided at a standard flat rate (for example, UK). The relative\nlevels of social transfer have important repercussions for income,\nand therefore health, inequalities within and between coun-\ntries.51\nCompeting interests: None.\nREFERENCES\n1.
