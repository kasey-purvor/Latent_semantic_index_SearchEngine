Introduction \n \nAny planned tidal barrage (or other coastal and offshore engineering) schemes should be subject \nto the following considerations (from Elliott et al, 2006): It should be: \n \n\u2022 Environmentally sustainable \n\u2022 Technologically feasible \n\u2022 Economically viable \n\u2022 Socially desirable\/tolerable \n\u2022 Legally permissible \n\u2022 Administratively achievable \n\u2022 Politically expedient \n \nWhile many of these points are socio-economic\/political and will require public debate and value \njudgements, here we wish to elucidate the technological and environmental facts related to \nvarious options. It has already been demonstrated (Baker, 1991; Burrows et al., 2008) that the \nlocations for the largest procurement of renewable marine energy, whilst still remaining cost-\neffective, are estuaries with a high tidal range utilising barrages. Tidal barrage solutions use \nestablished low-head hydropower technology. The tidal power scheme at La Rance scheme in \nFrance is now in its 40th year of operation (Pierre, 1993). Thus tidal barrages are technologically \nfeasible. In other areas with large tidal currents (e.g. straits and headlands) there is potential for \npower-generation using free-standing tidal stream turbines and other schemes using tidal lagoons \nhave been proposed. Burrows et al. (2008) discuss the economic viability, by drawing from the \nSustainable Development Commission report on tidal power (SDC, 2007), and they show that \nmajor barrages should be economically viable compared to other renewable technologies and \ncan produce a substantial proportion of the UK electricity demand. \n \nHere we review the potential environmental impacts of tidal power schemes in the near and far-\nfields, mainly with respect to tidal barrages. The impacts of the presently proposed tidal current \nschemes will be minimal and very local to the scheme due to their small power rating: at present \n 1\nthe maximum power rating mooted is 30GW (SDC, 2007). Impacts may be beneficial as well as \nharmful to the environment and some mitigation of potential harmful effects is possible (Gray, \n1992). However, in planning any construction, notice must be taken of conservation issues and \nexisting legislation. The European Habitats, Birds and Water Framework Directives are \nparticularly relevant. Many estuaries have some protected status. The only existing scheme at La \nRance illustrates some potential impacts e.g. increased muddiness of the seabed and enhanced \nproductivity of the foreshore (Kirby and Reti\u00e8re, 2007). Here we limit the direct investigation to the \nhydrodynamics but from this other potential environmental impacts are inferred. \n \nFrom the recent study of the potential tidal power of the eastern Irish Sea (Burrows et al., 2009, \nthis volume), some quantitative results are shown for the combined effects of 5 barrages on NW \nUK estuaries, using two approaches. The first approach uses a 0-D model in which turbine \ncharacteristics and tidal range are considered but not the detailed hydrodynamics. In the second \nphase of the modelling, a 2-D depth-averaged model (ADCIRC) was employed. This uses an \nunstructured finite-element grid to model the details of the tidal propagation around the west \ncoast of the UK, with and without tidal barrages. It has high resolution (down to 50m) around the \nbarrage locations. The predicted physical changes in tidal range, residuals, bottom stress and \nmixing are used to assess the likely environmental and ecological consequences. \n \n2. Generic Impacts of tidal power schemes \n \nIt has long been recognised that there will be environmental implications in building a tidal \nbarrage e.g. Hodd (1977) and Gordon (1994) discussed impacts for the Bay of Fundy scheme. \nBaker (1991) and Matthews and Young (1992) review generic environmental impacts for tidal \npower schemes. Many studies have been carried out in the UK for the Severn Estuary including \nestimation of impacts on the sediment regime and water quality (Shaw, 1980; Miles, 1982; Odd, \n1982; Parker and Kirby, 1982; Radford, 1982; Kirby, 1987; Shaw, 1990) with a recent resurgence \nof interest (Kirby and Shaw, 2005). BERR (2008) has identified the need for a strategic \nenvironmental assessment for the Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study. This will address the \nenvironmental impacts of any chosen scheme on biodiversity and wildlife, flood management, \ngeomorphology, water quality and other issues. In order to assess the present state of the \nenvironment and potential impacts, it is desirable to have some quantitative indicators. Aubry and \nElliott (2006) describe potential indicators of near shore seabed disturbance which have been \ngrouped into three broad indices (Coastline Morphological Change, Resource Use Change and \nEnvironmental Quality and its Perception) and applied to the Humber Estuary. Further work is still \nneeded to refine these methods (Boesch and Paul, 2001). Some information may be obtained \nfrom the experience of the existing tidal barrage at La Rance (Kirby and Reti\u00e8re, 2007). For \ncompleteness we here list the main local issues which may be of concern with respect to tidal \nbarrages. In the next section we also explore potential far-field impacts. \n \n2.1. Physical Changes \n \nBy impounding the water for part of the tide there will inevitably be some changes in the estuary \nbasin and channels. The tidal and residual flows will be modified, possibly leading to some local \nscouring around the structure, specifically in the outflow regions of the turbines and sluices, and \nsiltation in the basin. The amount of vertical mixing will be reduced where the tidal flows are \nreduced and with less re-suspension the levels of suspended particulate matter will drop, leading \nto increased light penetration. A reduction in mixing will also lead to an increase in density \nstratification. There will be reduced saline penetration within the basin leading to freshening i.e. \nmore brackish water. There may be a build-up of contaminants both physical and chemical due to \nreduced flushing rates. In areas of increased flows there may be potential re-suspension of \ncontaminated sediments. This may result in a net reduction in water quality. An abundance of \nnutrients combined with increased light availability may lead to increased primary production \n 2\npotentially leading to eutrophication. An increase in average water level inside the basin would \nlead to a decrease in ground water flows which may have impacts on land drainage. All these \neffects are to a large degree dependent upon the mode of operation of the barrage and are site \nspecific. Various mitigation methods including dredging and more stringent controls on \ndischarges may of course be undertaken. \n \n2.2. Environmental and ecological impacts \n \nIt must not be overlooked that a benefit of building tidal power plants is to reduce carbon \nemissions and hence benefit the environment locally and globally. However the most publicised \nimpact of tidal barrages is the potential loss of certain habitats, especially inter-tidal mudflats and \nsalt-marshes. These are particularly important for some species of birds and can be nationally \nand internationally protected areas. Benthic habitats may change in that the bottom stress due to \nwaves and currents may be modified. Migratory fish may be impeded although fish passes can be \nconstructed. Fish and marine mammals may suffer damage by collision with the barrage and \nturbines. Some estuaries may provide nurseries for breeding fish and conditions for these may no \nlonger be suitable. An increase in primary productivity may enhance the population of filter \nfeeders. \n \n2.3. Human, economic, aesthetic and amenity impacts \n \nThe character of an area and the landscape may be drastically changed if a tidal barrage is \nconstructed but in this case there may be pros and cons. Some people may find the visual \nintrusion objectionable but others may find it adds interest. There may be increased noise \nespecially during construction but also during operation. There may be a loss of historic sites in \nintertidal areas. However there may also be an increase in tourism and recreational potential of \nthe area. During construction there will be increased demand for resources and potential \ndisruption e.g. road transport may increase, but there will be economic benefits in terms of local \njobs. \n \nShellfish fisheries e.g. cockles and mussels could be affected, although being submerged for \nlonger could be advantageous in giving them more time to filter nutrients from the water (Cesar \nand Frid, pers. comm.). Cockles are a major prey item for birds and fish and an enhancement of \nthe food supply (see above) may provide the potential for aquaculture. There will be a change in \nthe access for the activities of cockle-pickers. Some coastal land used for agricultural grazing or \ncrops may be lost or more gained. Other activities such as marine transport and navigation may \nbe disrupted but a barrage also gives potential for road and rail crossings \n \nThe National Grid is not currently adapted to receive the large pulses of electricity and so some \ncostly re-development and innovative solutions may be necessary. \n \n3. Tidal Power schemes in the Eastern Irish Sea \n \nIn a recent study we have examined the tidal power potential of the eastern Irish Sea in some \ndetail (Burrows et al., 2008, this volume and http:\/\/www.liv.ac.uk\/engdept\/tidalpower). After the \nSevern Estuary this area has the highest tidal range in the UK. The area covered is shown in \nFigure 1, including the estuaries of the Dee, Mersey, Ribble, Morecambe Bay and the Solway \nFirth, together with contours of the tidal range. Here we examine the specific potential impacts of \ntidal power schemes in the near and far-fields for this area. For comparison the models have also \nbeen extended to include the Severn Estuary as this is well-known to be the largest potential tidal \nresource in the UK. \n \n 3\n3.1. Models \n3.1.1. 0-D Model (Generation) \n \nA 0-D (flat-estuary or two-tank) model has been developed in the project to synthesise barrage \noperation, with realistic turbine characteristics relating flow rate Q and power P to the head H \nacross the barrage and the variable efficiency (Burrows et al., 2008). Details of this model and \nresults are given in Burrows et al. (this volume). The barrage operation is then simulated using \nthe selected turbine number and characteristics, sluice gate area, delays, estuarial bathymetry \nand external tide. A prediction of power output and basin level is produced. This provides a useful \ntool in exploring the potential configuration and operation space of each barrage before modelling \nin the computationally expensive 2-D model. The presence of a barrage however will inevitably \nchange the tidal range at the barrage site and to model this, the 2-D model is required. \nFigure 1 Location of potential tidal barrages in the Eastern Irish Sea. \nContours show average spring tide amplitude. \n \n3.1.2. 2-D Model (ADCIRC) \n \nADCIRC is a 2-D depth integrated shallow water model which is solved using an unstructured \ngrid approach for the discretisation of the mass equation and the momentum equation, which is \nformulated in the generalized wave continuity form. The model was developed in the USA (Hench \nand Leuttich 2003, Leuttich and Westerink 1995) for use in modelling tides and surges on shelf \nseas. The ADCIRC model allows the simulation of multiple barrage schemes in conjunction to \nexplore their cumulative impact upon the environment and their power production potential and \nwas chosen because it is freely available online. \n \n 4\nBarrages with the same hydraulic characteristics as used in the 0-D model have been inserted \ninto the 2-D model. The objectives of the 2-D modelling, within the recently completed Joule \nCentre funded project, extend to evaluation of any impact on the overall tidal dynamics of the Irish \nSea as a consequence of the energy extraction from the conjunctive operation of the barrages \ndiscussed herein (those in the estuaries of the North West of England together with the Severn) \nas well as potential sites for major tidal stream arrays. Arising from this, implications, if any, from \nbiophysical coupling in the marine ecosystem, manifesting water quality or ecological \nconsequences were to be reviewed (Burrows et al., 2008). Companion studies on the impact of \nbarrage operation on the estuarial sediment regime are currently underway at Liverpool, using a \n2-D TELEMAC model of the Dee and Mersey estuary (Carroll et al., 2008). \n \nDue to the nature of the tides off the west coast of the UK the simulated area, as shown in Figure \n2, was very large so as to model the propagation of the tidal waves from deep water over the \nshelf edge and on into the estuaries of the west coast of the UK. This is especially important in \nthe Bristol Channel and Severn estuary as non-linear resonance effects determine the large tidal \namplitude in this estuary (Fong and Heaps, 1978). The unstructured grid permits the resolution to \nchange from a coarse 15km in the deep water at the forced open boundary down to 50m in \nshallow estuaries and near barrage structures. The grid contains almost 400,000 nodes and over \n750,000 elements and is solved using 96 processors with a 1 second time step. This takes ~24 \nhours for a 31 day simulation, which includes 1 day spin up and a 15 day settling period and was \nforced using the 5 major tidal constituents in this region: M2; S2; N2; O1 and K1. The model was \nfirst run without barrages, for a baseline state, and then with 5 barrages within the Severn, Dee, \nMersey, Morecambe Bay and Solway estuaries. \nFigure 2 ADCIRC model domain showing increased resolution as the estuaries are approached. \n \nTo validate the model, comparisons were made against tide gauge observations throughout the \nmodelled area. The error estimates of the dominant semi-diurnal M2 and S2 tidal constituents, \ntogether with some other models of the same area published recently are shown below in Table 1 \nand Table 2. \n \n \n \n 5\n Error \nADCIRC vs. \nDataset 1 \n(59) \nADCIRC \nvs. Dataset \n2 (198) \nJones \nADCIRC \n(198) \nJones \nTelemac \n(198) \nPOLCOMS \n(257) \nAmp Mean (cm) 1.04 0.41 6.41 3.85 -4.99 \nAmp RMS (cm) 9.89 10.15 17.14 23.97 14.90 \nPhase Mean (deg) 0.30 0.29 -1.07 0.28 -1.00 \nPhase RMS (deg) 9.59 11.53 17.62 41.08 14.76 \nHs (cm) 11.09 14.42 31.50 36.05 21.61 \nTable 1 Mean and RMS errors (model minus observation) from a comparison with \nharmonic analysis of M2 from tide gauge data, datasets 1 and 2, around the Irish and \nCeltic Seas.

POLCOMS model shows errors associated with this model against comparable \nobservation datasets. \n \n3.2. Far field effects \n \nThe ADCIRC model has been used to examine large-scale changes in tidal amplitude, bed \nstress, stratification\/mixing and residual flows and hence their implications for sediment transport \n(without recourse to a detailed sediment transport model), fisheries and other environmental \nchange. Note that here we only examine the tidal residual current, whereas there may also be \ncontributions from wind-driven and buoyancy-driven flows. The direction of bed stress is an \nindicator of sediment movement as bed load and various regions of convergence and divergence \nare often in good agreement with locations of sediment deposition. The bedload sediment \ntransport rate is expected to be related to some power of the bed stress. 2D models have been \nused to examine the spatial distributions of sediments on the northwest European shelf (Pingree \nand Griffiths, 1979), or in more limited regions (Aldridge, 1997).  \n \nThe mixing (due to the tidal stirring) and stratification (due to solar heating) of the water column \nare in  balance at the shelf sea tidal mixing fronts, the position of which can be described by the \nratio of the total water depth to the cube of a measure of the tidal current strength (Simpson and \nHunter, 1974). Convergence and upwelling associated with tidal fronts can be important for the \nfeeding of fish larvae (e.g. Hao et al, 2003). There may be some implications of the movement of \nthe tidal mixing front for Nephrops in the Irish Sea. (Nephrops is also known as scampi, Dublin \n 6\nBay Prawn, or Langoustine.) The Irish Sea Nephrops fishery is the second largest Nephrops \nfishery for the UK outside the North Sea with reported international landings of 9,120 tonnes in \n2007. The majority of the catch is from the western Irish Sea, in an area centred on the location of \nthe tidal mixing front (http:\/\/www.cefas.co.uk\/media\/63515\/nephropsirishsea.pdf). Nephrops \ndistribution is limited by the extent of suitable muddy sediment in which they construct burrows. \nBurrow emergence is known to depend on biological and environmental factors such as ambient \nlight level and tides. \n \nFigure 3 M2 tidal amplitude (m) in a) Present\nsituation simulation and b) difference (m) due to \n1x DoEn ebb mode barrage simulation; c) \ndifference due to 3x DoEn dual mode barra\nSpring-neap frontal migration is generally only a few kilometres (Sharples, 2008). Sharples (2008) \nalso shows that inter-annual changes in the timing of the spring-neap cycle can have a large \nimpact on the primary productivity associated with fronts. The strongest impacts are predicted \nwithin 15\u201350 km of the tidal mixing fronts, with increases in sub-surface primary production and \ncarbon export. At the fronts, there is substantial extra primary production driven by the spring-\nneap cycle, contributing an extra 70% annually compared to fronts forced by the M2 tide only. \n \nLocal changes near headlands, where proposed tidal stream turbines would harness the energy \nof tidal streams, may affect the location of offshore sandbanks (Pingree and Maddock, 1979; \nDyer and Huntley, 1999), which are of considerable economic and ecological importance. Those \nclose to the shore may be linked to beaches in a dynamic exchange of sediment. They may act to \ndissipate wave energy and thus provide some coastal protection from erosion and wave \novertopping but may also be hazards to shipping. They can provide exploitable reserves of sand \nge \nsimulation. \na) b)\nc) \n 7\nand gravel (marine aggregates). Finally, sand banks are also areas of great importance to the \nhealth of the fishing industry, as the banks are important nursery and feeding grounds for many \nfish species.  \n \n3.2.1. Present Situation \n \nThe present situation throughout the simulated region is initially shown so that the changes \nintroduced by the barrages can be seen in context. The amplitude of the M2 tidal constituent is \nshown in Figure 3 a). The large amplitudes throughout the eastern Irish Sea and in the Bristol \nChannel are clearly visible, together with the two amphidromic points in this region, one off the \neast coast of Ireland in the Celtic Sea and the other between the north coast of Northern Ireland \nand the west coast of Scotland. \n \na) b)\nc) \nFigure 4 Bottom stress (m2\/s2): a) present \nsituation; b) difference due to 1x DoEn ebb \nmode simulation; c) difference due to 3x \nDoEn dual mode simulation. \nThe maximum M2 bottom stress, calculated from cDu|u| (where cD is the drag coefficient and u is \nthe depth-averaged current), is shown in Figure 4a), which reveals the location of the major areas \nof energy dissipation. The drag coefficient applied in the model is not constant throughout but \ntakes two distinct values with 2\u00d710-3 everywhere except in the Bristol Channel where it is \nincreased to 3\u00d710-3 (this was necessary to give a good tidal simulation in the Bristol \nChannel\/Severn Estuary: the position of this change is clearly visible in the bottom stress plot). \n 8\nThe large bottom stress in the Bristol Channel is the cause of the large amount of suspended \nsediment in the waters in this area. The large stresses seen off the coasts of West Wales and \nNorthern Anglesey reveal large currents that are both currently proposed areas for tidal stream \nfarms. \n \nThe stratification parameter, log10(h\/|u|3), gives an indication of the location of tidal mixing fronts \nwhen using a 2D depth integrated model. The critical value of 2.7 \u00b1 0.3 defines the tidal mixing \nfronts where the water column changes from stratified to fully mixed (Simpson and Hunter, 1974). \nLarger values indicate stratified conditions and lower values more well-mixed. The major fronts in \nthe Celtic Sea and the Western Irish Sea are clearly visible in Figure 5a) running from the \nSouthern Irish coast to the North coast of Cornwall and from the Eastern coast of Ireland across \nto the Isle of Man. \n \na) b)\nFigure 5 Plot of tidal mixing front locations \nfor: a) present situation overlying \nstratification parameter; b) 1x DoEn ebb \nmode simulation; c) 3x DoEn dual mode \nsimulation. \nc) \nThe tidal residuals, within the Irish Sea, are shown in Figure 6. The major features of the \ngenerally southward flow along the Northwest coast of England, the clockwise gyre off the \nNortheast coast of Anglesey and the gyres around the Isle of Man are reproduced well by the \nmodel. The residual currents within the large estuaries of the Solway and Morecambe Bay are \ngenerally outward flows across the mouth with only small localised inward currents. \n \n 9\n3.2.2. Barrage resultant changes (1x DoEn Ebb mode) \n \nThe addition of 5 barrages within the Severn, Solway, Morecambe Bay, Mersey and Dee \nestuaries is simulated when the optimal economic cost of energy production is used to determine \nthe number of turbines and sluice gates and mode of operation within each barrage. This scheme \nis called the 1x DoEn scheme and is comparable to the schemes determined by the Department \nof Energy in their 1980\u2019s studies of these estuaries for best economic viability (Baker 1986, 1991 \nand Burrows et al, 2008). \n \nFigure 6 Tidal Residual Currents (m\/s) in present conditions. Wind and Buoyancy residuals \nnot included \nThe first far field impact to consider is the change in the M2 tidal amplitude as shown in Figure \n3b). The amplitude is obviously decreased considerably behind the barrages but also the \namphidromic point off the east coast of Ireland is shifted slightly. There is a small decrease in \ntidal amplitude seen to the south of the amphidromic point and across and up the Bristol Channel \nwhere the barrage has removed some of the resonance and thus markedly lowered the tidal \namplitude. North of the amphidromic point the tidal amplitude increases. In this simulation the \nincrease along the Irish coastline is about 10-15 cm but this varies depending upon the mode of \noperation of the barrages. \n \nThe change in bottom stress is shown in Figure 4b). It is clear that there is a decrease in bottom \nstress throughout the Severn estuary and within the basins of the Solway and Morecambe Bay \nbarrage schemes. A decrease is also noted north of the Isle of Man. These decreases are \nassociated with a drop in water speed at these sites and will tend therefore to allow a larger \namount of sediment settlement and will also decrease bed scour and re-suspension in these \nregions. \n \nThe changes in location of the tidal mixing fronts are shown in Figure 5b). The exact location of \nthe fronts is affected by the barrages but this remains within the natural variability of the frontal \nlocation at present. \n 10\nFigure 7 Tidal Residual Currents (m\/s) with 1x DoEn Ebb mode. \n \nThe residual currents in the Irish Sea, for the 1x DoEn scheme operating in ebb mode, are shown \nin Figure 7. Through comparison with Figure 6 it is clear that the major changes occur within the \nvicinity of the barrages. The residual currents are determined mainly by the operation mode and \nthe location of the sluice gates and turbines in the barrages. The inflow through the sluice gates \nand outflow through the turbines is clearly seen in both the Solway and Morecambe Bay together \nwith the resultant gyres. The Mersey estuary is affected to a much greater extent outside of the \nbarrage than the other barrages due to its upriver location. \n \n3.2.3. Barrage resultant changes (3x DoEn Dual mode) \n \nThe 3x DoEn scheme is an enhanced turbine scheme whereby three times as many turbines are \nused than prescribed in the best economic case of the original Department of Energy studies. \nThis results in a larger volume of water passing through the barrages and, when operated in dual \n(ebb and flood generation) mode, preserves a larger portion of the tidal range within the enclosed \nbasins behind the barrages. This may be considered the best environmental situation, although \nthe economics of energy production deteriorate (Burrows et al, 2008). \n \nThe changes to the M2 tidal amplitude are shown in Figure 3c). The same qualitative pattern is \nseen as for the 1x DoEn schemes operating in ebb mode shown in Figure 3b). In this \nconfiguration however the impacts are larger throughout the Irish Sea with an increase along the \nIrish coast of 15 - 20 cm in tidal amplitude (up to ~10% of baseline). \n \nThe changes in bottom stress are shown in Figure 4c). Again this is qualitatively similar to the 1x \nDoEn scheme but has a larger quantitative effect. The decrease in bottom stress in the Bristol \nChannel is up to 30% larger in this operation mode than in the ebb schemes considered \npreviously. \n \n 11\nThe tidal mixing fronts, seen in Figure 5c) again do not move very far, and remain within the \nnatural variability of the present situation, but the range of variability of the Celtic Sea front is \nquite different from that seen in the 1x DoEn case and the present situation. \n \nThe residual currents in the Irish Sea are shown in Figure 8. The residual currents in the 3x DoEn \ndual mode simulation very closely match the residual currents in the present conditions. The gyre \ncirculation patterns associated with the 1x DoEn ebb mode scheme are not present here due to \nthe larger turbine capacity which allows the water to flow through on both the ebb and flood tidal \nphases. As the turbines are generally situated in the deep water channels, through which the \nmajority of the natural water fluxes occur, the currents associated with the restricted flow regime \nthrough the turbines nevertheless matches well with the present conditions. \n \nFigure 8 Tidal Residual Currents (m\/s) with 3x DoEn Dual mode. \n \n3.3. Environmental Implications \n \nThe far field environmental implications of the installation of these five barrages are qualitatively \nsimilar whichever scheme and mode of operation is chosen. The exact quantitative values of the \nchanges are highly dependent upon the exact scheme and mode of operation chosen for each \nbarrage. \n \nThe primary impact of the barrages is the increased flooding risk, due to the increase in tidal \namplitude, along the east coast of Ireland and Northern Ireland which is up to 10% of the present \ntidal range (near the tidal amphidrome). This is significantly less than the effect of the passage of \na typical storm surge event (the 1 in 50 year surge for that area is about 1m, according to Lowe \nand Gregory, 2005) but will slightly increase the probability of higher water levels in that area.  \n \nThe tides in the Bristol Channel are reduced in amplitude and this may help reduce storm surge \nflooding risks in this area. The impact on the tides in the Irish Sea as a whole is small with a slight \n 12\nincrease being seen of about 5 cm on average across the region under the 1x DoEn ebb mode \nscheme and 10 cm for the 3x DoEn scheme in dual mode. \n \nThe reduction in bottom stress seen in the Bristol Channel has implications for the sediment \nregime in this area. The reduced bottom stress and associated velocities mean that the water \ncolumn will become less turbid and allow more light penetration. It will also permit a greater bio-\ndiversity in the benthic habitat as the velocities at the sea bed reduce (Kirby and Reti\u00e8re, 2007). \n \nThe stratification of the Irish and Celtic Seas and location of the tidal mixing fronts remains largely \nunchanged by the inclusion of the barrages which means that these regions of high primary \nproduction will remain in the same locations. \n \nThe residual currents within the region are only significantly affected in the locality of the \nbarrages. The largest extent of effect away from the barrage is seen in the Mersey Estuary due to \nits upriver estuarine location rather than its being located at the mouth of the estuary. \n3.4. Changes within estuaries and near-field effects \n \nThe main impacts which have been identified by many conservation groups are the changes in \ninter-tidal area from the undisturbed situation and the impact upon the fish, invertebrate and bird \npopulations within the estuaries. It is clear that there will be a reduction in the intertidal mud-flats \ndue to the construction of an estuarine barrage. These provide important habitats for many \nspecies and feeding grounds for birds.  \n \nThe 0-D model results identified the potential for amelioration of this effect by use of dual-mode \noperation and increased turbine capacity which would act to increase the tidal range within the \nbasin relative to ebb mode (although this would increase the cost of electricity generated).  \n \nA barrage will block the entry of longer period swell waves but local generation of waves within an \nestuary can still impact on intertidal areas (Wolf, 2003 and 2004; M\u00f6ller and Spencer, 2002 and \n2003). Raised low water level can increase the effective time averaged fetch within an estuary \n(Gray, 1992) and thereby increase the impact of the waves generated within a barraged area \ncompared to any present situation. \n \nThe 2-D ADCIRC model has been used to calculate more accurately the change in intertidal area. \nThese numbers are highly dependent upon the available bathymetry for which the Mersey and \nDee have excellent high resolution LiDAR data whilst the others are coarse with little vertical \n680 685 690 695 700 705 710 715 7200\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nTime (hrs)\nIn\nte\nrti\nda\nl A\nre\na \n(km\n2 )\n \n \nPresent 1x DoEn Ebb 3x DoEn Dual\n120\n555 560 565 570 575 580 585 590 5950\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTime (hrs)\nIn\nte\nrti\nda\nl A\nre\na \n(km\n2 )\n \n \nPresent 1x DoEn Ebb 3x DoEn Dual\nFigure 9 Intertidal area of Severn barrage basin for a typical: a) spring tide; b) neap tide. \na) b)\n 13\nresolution above mean water level. Thus the quantitative results shown should be understood \nwith this in mind. Examples of the intertidal areas for different installation and operation scenarios \nare shown in Figure 9 to Figure 11 for the Severn, Mersey and Dee estuaries. \n \nThe relative changes in intertidal area are seen to change from spring to neap tides and from site \nto site depending upon the underlying bathymetry. What is consistent throughout the simulations \nis the phase shift in the intertidal dynamics. This is due to the barrage operation requiring the \ntides to be held back to generate a head difference for power production. \n \nThe maximum intertidal area is shown below in Figure 12a) to provide a simple visual comparison \nof the impact of the barrages. This reveals that increasing the installed turbine capacity in dual \nmode does have a marked increase in the maximum intertidal area retained within the basin area. \nThe specific maximum area retained by any given scheme is highly dependent upon the \nbathymetry of the enclosed basin and no general statement for all barrage enclosed regions can \nbe made. \n \n680 685 690 695 700 705 710 715 7200\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nTime (hrs)\nIn\nte\nrti\nda\nl A\nre\na \n(km\n2 )\n \n \nPresent 1x DoEn Ebb 3x DoEn Dual\n45\n555 560 565 570 575 580 585 590 5950\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nTime (hrs)\nIn\nte\nrti\nda\nl A\nre\na \n(km\n2 )\n \n \nPresent 1x DoEn Ebb 3x DoEn Dual\nFigure 10 Intertidal area of Mersey barrage basin for a typical: a) spring tide; b) neap tide. \na) b)\n680 685 690 695 700 705 710 715 7200\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nTime (hrs)\nIn\nte\nrti\nda\nl A\nre\na \n(km\n2 )\n \n \nPresent 1x DoEn Ebb 3x DoEn Dual\n90\n555 560 565 570 575 580 585 590 5950\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nTime (hrs)\nIn\nte\nrti\nda\nl A\nre\na \n(km\n2 )\n \n \nPresent 1x DoEn Ebb 3x DoEn Dual\na) \nFigure 11 Intertidal area of Dee barrage basin for a typical: a) spring tide; b) neap tide. \nb)\n 14\nThese numbers are within the enclosed basins only and do not include the effect on the \nmaximum intertidal area outside of the basin. For most of the barrage schemes the latter effect is \nnegligible, but for the Severn and Mersey barrages there is a marked impact on tidal amplitudes \nfor a distance seaward of the barrage.  \n \na) b)\nFigure 12 Intertidal area for each basin as: a) maximum extent; b) average available. \nIt is also instructive to consider the average amount of 'mudflats' available. By integrating the total \narea and dividing by the length of simulation time we arrive at an average area of mudflat \nexposed, as shown above in Figure 12b). The anomalous result for the Morecambe Bay barrage \nmay suggest the requirement for better bathymetry within this region. With the exception of the \nSolway, the percentage area retained for the 3x DoEn scheme is remarkably consistent at ~75% \nof the undisturbed area. \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThe introduction of tidal barrages into 5 major estuaries along the west coast of the UK has a \nwide range of potential impacts. Here we have attempted to quantify these impacts using 0-D and \n2-D models. The largest potential impact at the far field scale is the increase in tidal amplitude \nalong the east coast of Ireland possibly leading to enhanced coastal flood risk. There is little other \nfar field impact of any importance seen using the 2-D model, although future studies using 3-D \nmodels may identify impacts not currently modelled.  \n \nLocally to all the barrages there are reductions in tidal range and within the impounded basins \nthere are even greater decreases. A general loss of intertidal habitat is observed within the basin \nregions which will have an impact upon the carrying capacity of the estuaries for birds.  \n \nThere is an associated change in bottom stress with each barrage which will impact upon the \nbenthic habitats at each site, although this is site specific in its quantitative effect. The reduced \nturbidity in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary may lead to an increase in bio-diversity in the \nbenthic habitat. \n \nThe impacts upon the local environment can be reduced if a larger installed turbine capacity is \nused in dual mode operation. This mode of operation is shown to retain a large percentage of the \n 15\npresent tidal range within the basin area. The use of the turbines for pumping, to enhance head \ndifferences prior to electricity generation, will help to reduce the impacts within the basin and also \nincrease the power potential of the barrages. \n \n5.
