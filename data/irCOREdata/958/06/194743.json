Atmospheric composition and structure (middle\natmosphere \u2013 composition and chemistry) Meterology and\natmospheric dynamics (middle atmosphere dynamics; waves\nand tides)\n1 Introduction\nThere have been numerous modelling studies of tides in the\nMesosphere Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region, many of\nwhich involve the comparison with observations made by in-\nstruments on board the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite\n(UARS) (e.g. Roble and Ridley, 1994; Burrage et al., 1995;\nAkmaev et al., 1996; Hagan et al., 1997; McLandres et al.,\n1997; Wu et al., 1997; Yee et al., 1997; Roble and Shepherd,\n1997; Yudin et al., 1998). These have been especially useful\nin placing constraints on processes that influence the magni-\ntude of the diurnal tide in the MLT region. However, there\nis still uncertainty with respect to much of the physics that\ngoverns the background atmospheric structure of this region,\nCorrespondence to: M. J. Harris\n(matthew@apg.ph.ucl.ac.uk)\nsuch as collisionally induced CO2 15\u00b5m radiative cooling,\nexothermic chemical heating, and gravity wave dissipative\nheating, turbulence, and momentum drag. The situation is\nmade more complicated by the nonlinear coupling of ener-\ngetics, dynamics, and photochemistry.\nRoble and Shepherd (1997) used the National Cen-\nter for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere-\nMesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model\n(NCAR TIME-GCM, Roble and Ridley, 1994) to investigate\nthe effects of increased lower boundary tidal forcing on pa-\nrameters such as meridional wind, atomic oxygen distribu-\ntion, and 0(1S) 557.7 nm green line volume emission rates\nin the MLT region. They showed that tides play an impor-\ntant role in atomic oxygen distribution, leading to depletions\nin mean atomic oxygen density at the equator, in agreement\nwith Forbes et al. (1993) and the later study of Angelats i\nCol and Forbes (1998). The first mechanism put forward for\nthis depletion was proposed by Akmaev and Shved (1980),\nwho suggested that the net recombination increased in tidal\ndisplaced parcels of air. Angelats i Col and Forbes (1998)\nfound that the mean vertical transport contributed to the de-\npletion of O at the equator. They showed that a net downward\nvertical motion between 85\u2013100 km at the equator would de-\nplete O through the transport to a region of increased recom-\nbination. It is, however, worth noting that the vertical wind\nfields derived in their paper showed a region of net down-\nwelling at the equator, and upwelling in the tropics. This\ndiffers from the derived fields for January and October pre-\nsented by Miyahara et al. (1991) and Fauliot et al. (1997),\nwho showed cells of net upwelling at the equator, and down-\nwelling in the tropics in the 80\u2013105 km region.\nIn this paper, an investigation is made into the relative\nmagnitude of the processes that are responsible for the pro-\nduction and loss of atomic oxygen in the mean field, and the\neffect of tides upon the mean temperature structure due to\nvariations in exothermic chemical heating and mean circula-\ntion. This is carried out using the newly developed University\nCollege London Coupled Middle Atmosphere and Thermo-\nsphere (CMAT) general circulation model.\n226 M. J.

It covers a vertical range from\n10 mbar (\u223c 30 km) to 7.587 pbar (\u223c 300\u2013600 km), numeri-\ncally solving the primitive nonlinear coupled equations of en-\nergy, momentum, and continuity with a forward time centred\nspace finite difference scheme. The following points high-\nlight the main features of the model, which include updates to\nthe original thermospheric scheme, and extensions required\nin order to simulate mesospheric energetics, dynamics and\ncomposition. A detailed description of CMAT is given by\nFig. 2. Zonal mean temperature (K) as given by MSIS-E90 (top),\nand zonal mean zonal wind as given by HWM (ms\u22121) (bottom) for\nequinox.

The fluxes, absorption and ionisation cross sec-\ntions between 0.1\u2013105 nm are summarized by Fuller-\nRowell (1992), and those between 105\u2013194 nm in\nthe Schumann-Runge continuum are given by Torr et\nal.

The effect\nof transport on major constituent continuity with mutual\nmolecular diffusion is solved for O2, N2, and Ox = (O\n+ O3) (see Fuller-Rowell et al., 1996). Minor species\ntransport is solved for N(4S), N(2D), NO, HOx = OH +\nHO2 + H, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, NO2, O(1D), and\nHe. H2O2 and O(1D) are assumed to be in a state of\nphotochemical equilibrium.\n(VI) High-latitude ionospheric parameters are determined\nfrom the Coupled Sheffield University High-Latitude\nIonosphere Model (Quegan et al., 1982; Fuller-Rowell\net al., 1996), which solves for electron and ion tem-\nperature; field-aligned velocities and distribution of O+\nand H+; the distribution of O2+, N2+, NO+, N+ as-\nsuming photochemical equilibrium; and electron den-\nsity. High-latitude auroral precipitation, including the\neffect of medium energy electrons, is taken from the\nTIROS\/NOAA auroral precipitation statistical model\n(Fuller-Rowell and Evans, 1987; Codrescu et al., 1997),\nand electric field strength from Foster et al.

The\neffect of high-latitude, small-scale electric field variabil-\nity is also included (after Codrescu et al., 2000).\n(VII) A Hybrid Matsuno-Lindzen parameterisation, as out-\nlined by Meyer (1999), is used to calculate gravity\nwave drag. The source spectrum at 20 km consists of\n19 waves with velocities ranging between \u00b1 60 ms\u22121,\npropagating in both the zonal and meridional directions.\nThe distribution of wave amplitudes is Gaussian about\n0 ms\u22121, with the zero velocity wave having an ampli-\ntude 20 times that of the \u00b1 60 ms\u22121 waves. The spec-\ntrum is filtered between 20 km and the lower boundary\nat about 30 km, in accordance with the output from the\nHorizontal Wave Model (Hedin et al., 1993). The over-\nall intermittency factor and peak amplitude used in the\nparameterisation have been selected to attain a reason-\nable mesospheric wind structure and comparable wave\ndrag profiles, as calculated by other models.

Wind\nImaging Doppler Images (WINDII) measured maximum am-\nplitudes of 60\u201370 ms\u22121 (McLandres et al., 1996), compared\nto about 20 ms\u22121 as calculated by CMAT. The reason for this\nM.

This has also been encountered in stud-\nies with the NCAR TIME-GCM (Roble and Ridley, 1995;\nRoble and Shepherd, 1997; Yee et al.,1997). As with the\nNCAR TIME-GCM, CMAT runs without gravity wave dis-\nsipation to produce diurnal tidal amplitudes in close agree-\nment with the observations. In order to attain similar upper\nmesospheric amplitudes to those observed, Roble and Shep-\nherd (1997) increased the lower boundary tidal forcing of the\nNCAR TIME-GCM by a factor of 2.5. This factor is also\napplied in this study to the second CMAT run, such that the\npeak geopotential height amplitude of the lower boundary\n(1, 1) diurnal tidal forcing is 35 m. All other model inputs\nare unchanged with respect to the standard run.\n4 CMAT results and discussion\n4.1 CMAT mean background atmospheric structure\nCMAT zonal mean temperature and zonal wind fields are\nshown in Fig. 1, and similar plots from the Mass Spectrome-\n230 M. J. Harris et al.: A study into the effect of the diurnal tide\nFig. 7. Local time variation of atomic oxygen number density\n(\u00d71017 m\u22123) as calculated by CMAT for 12:00 LT March at the\nequator, with normal lower boundary tidal forcing (top), and \u00d72.5\nlower boundary tidal forcing (bottom).\nter and ground-based Incoherent Scatter (MSIS-E90) empiri-\ncal model (Hedin, 1991), and the empirical Horizontal Wind\nModel (HWM) (Hedin et al., 1993), are shown in Fig. 2. The\nCMAT middle atmosphere temperature structure is in rea-\nsonable agreement with the MSIS-E90 for similar geophys-\nical conditions. Both plots show a maximum stratopause\ntemperature of about 280 K in the 45\u201350 km height region.\nThe mesopause structure does, however, differ slightly in that\nCMAT has a local temperature maximum at about 90 km, as-\nsociated with exothermic chemical heating. This global fea-\nture has been simulated in other modelling studies (Roble,\n1995; Berger and von Zahn, 1999). Both CMAT and MSIS-\nE90 give mesopause minima of about 180 K at high-latitudes\nFig. 8. Diurnal mean of atomic oxygen at the equator as calcu-\nlated by CMAT with normal (dashed) and \u00d72.5 lower boundary\ntidal forcing (solid).\nin the 100 km region.\nThe general morphology of the CMAT zonal mean zonal\nwind field is in agreement with HWM, though significant\ndifferences are present. The mid-latitude eastward zonal\njets in the 55\u201360 km region, as calculated by CMAT, have a\nmaximum of about 38 ms\u22121, compared to 28 ms\u22121 given by\nHWM. Furthermore, CMAT is unable to reproduce the equa-\ntorial and subtropical eastward winds in the 45\u201370 km height\nregion. The equatorial westward wind structure between 70\u2013\n100 km is more extended in altitude in CMAT than in HWM,\nwhich shows a reversal at about 110 km. The discrepancies\nbetween CMAT and observed wind and temperature fields\nare most likely due to the representation of gravity wave dis-\nsipation in CMAT, as discussed in the previous section.\n4.2 The effect of the diurnal tide\nFigure 3 shows the meridional wind structure at 12:00 LT, as\ncalculated by CMAT, for normal (top) and increased (bot-\ntom) lower boundary tidal forcing. With increased forcing,\nCMAT is in close agreement with meridional winds mea-\nsured by the High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) on\nboard the UARS satellite (compare Fig. 3 (bottom) to Fig. 5\n(top), Yudin et al., 1997). Figure 4 gives the diurnal am-\nplitude structure of the meridional wind, as calculated by\nCMAT, for the two runs. Without increased lower bound-\nary tidal forcing, CMAT gives peak amplitudes of about\n20 ms\u22121, compared to 75 ms\u22121 with increased forcing. The\namplitude structure determined from WINDII observations\nis given in Fig. 5 (bottom). The increased tidal forcing run is\nin reasonable agreement with the HRDI data between 80\u2013\n100 km, but it overestimates the amplitude between 100\u2013\n110 km. The diurnal amplitude and phase at 20 N with nor-\nmal and increased lower boundary tidal forcing are shown\nin Fig. 6. The phase variation with height is in reasonable\nagreement with WINDII measurements (e.g. Hagan et al.,\n1997). CMAT gives a phase of about 22 h at 96 km during\nM. J.

The absolute magnitudes are, how-\never, smaller in CMAT than those observed by about a fac-\ntor of 2, suggesting that the overall O number densities are\ntoo low. An increase in overall O of about 25% would re-\nFig. 10. Zonal mean difference between normal and \u00d72.5 lower\nboundary tidal forcing runs, in temperature (top), vertical wind\n(middle, positive values denote increase in upward winds), and\natomic oxygen (bottom).\nmove this discrepancy. As suggested by Roble and Shepherd\n(1997), lower peak O densities may be in some part due to\nan overestimation of eddy diffusion in the model. Figure 7\nshows the local time variation of atomic oxygen at the equa-\ntor, as calculated by CMAT, for the two runs. In agreement\nwith the NCAR TIME-GCM simulations presented by Roble\nand Shepherd (1997), the atomic oxygen layer between 90\u2013\n100 km is strongly affected by tides at the equator. Oscil-\nlations penetrate the peak layer, resulting in much stronger\ndiurnal variation due to changes in the overall density and\nvertical transport. The change in the diurnal cycle local max-\nimum of O density does, however, differ between CMAT and\nthe NCAR TIME-GCM. By increasing the lower boundary\ntidal forcing in the NCAR TIME-GCM, Roble and Shepherd\n(1997) found that the local maximum of O number density at\nthe equator, which occurs around 12:00 LT, decreased from\n232 M. J. Harris et al.: A study into the effect of the diurnal tide\nFig. 11. Mean circulation induced with increased lower boundary\ntidal forcing as calculated by CMAT. The vertical winds have been\nscaled up by a factor of 80. Maximum vertical winds at the equa-\ntor in the 90\u2013100 km height region are about 3 cm\u2212s, and the maxi-\nmum meridional winds in the same height region at\u00b1 10\u25e6 are about\n7.5 ms\u22121.\nabout 6\u00d7 1017 to 5\u00d7 1017 m\u22123. In CMAT, the opposite oc-\ncurs, with an increase of 5 \u00d7 1017 to 6 \u00d7 1017 m\u22123. Since\nthe main mechanisms responsible for the diurnal variation\nof O are increased with stronger tides, it follows that this\ncan result in larger extremes of the O number density vari-\nation. This would not be the case if the overall depletion\nof mean O was sufficiently large, for example, due to the\nnet increase in the recombination, as discussed previously. It\nshould be noted, however, that although Akmaev and Shved\n(1980) reported a decrease in O above 100 km due to tidal in-\nduced recombination; they showed a slight increase in peak\nO densities at about 95 km. This may be in some part due to\nthe omission of mean background circulation associated with\ntidal dissipation in their 1-dimensional model. The peak O\ndensity in the TIME-GCM occurs at about 100 km for weak\ntidal forcing, which is about 3 km higher than in CMAT. This\nmay account for the decrease rather than the increase in mean\nO, simulated in CMAT with increased tidal forcing. Figure 8\nshows the diurnal mean atomic oxygen vertical profile at the\nequator for both CMAT runs. The mean peak in O is seen to\ndecrease by about 11%, and the integrated column between\n80\u2013140 km by about 4%. Between about 80\u201390 km, stronger\ntidal forcing increases O number densities, as expected with\ntidal oscillations of the O peak layer that penetrate to lower\naltitudes.\nFigure 10 shows the difference fields for zonal mean tem-\nperature (top), zonal mean vertical wind (middle), and zonal\nmean atomic oxygen (bottom), caused by stronger lower\nboundary tidal forcing. The trends in atomic oxygen and\ntemperature between \u00b120\u25e6 in latitude are in agreement with\nthe modelling study of Forbes and Roble (1993), and the\ncell-like vertical wind structure induced by increased dissi-\npating tides is similar to mean vertical wind fields derived\nfrom WINDII observations (Fauliot et al., 1997). Figure 11\nillustrates the circulation pattern induced by tidal dissipa-\ntion. The production\/loss terms for Ox calculated by CMAT\nshow that mean circulation induced by tidal dissipation con-\ntributes to the change in mean O in the equatorial region. The\nmagnitude of this effect, compared to the increased recom-\nbination mechanism is, however, very difficult to determine\nfrom CMAT output. This is due to the complexity associated\nwith a self-consistent model, and the fact that the numeri-\ncal scheme is in fixed pressure coordinates. The calculation\nof net chemical loss in a tidally displaced air parcel due to\nrecombination effects would best be suited to a Lagrangian\nanalysis, tracking the air parcel as it is vertically advected\nthrough the diurnal cycle. Therefore, the following analysis\nof production and loss is only able to highlight the relative\ncontributions of the terms in the Ox production\/loss equa-\ntion, and can give little information as to the components in\neach term. For example, the net loss associated with verti-\ncal advection may have two components. It could be due to\na combination of net upward vertical motion of O poor air,\nand the increased recombination effect associated with tidal\noscillations.\nFigure 12 (top) shows the Ox mass mixing ratio at 98 km\n16\u25e6 N for a CMAT run when increased lower boundary forc-\ning is introduced. It takes 2\u20133 days for the effect of increased\ntides to fully propagate to this altitude, after which the ampli-\ntude in the oscillations of Ox is seen to increase. A decrease\nin the mass mixing ratio is observed, as seen in the diurnal\nmean Ox number density trend. Figure 12 (bottom) shows\nthe diurnal mean production and loss terms of Ox mass mix-\ning ratio for the same location and run. As the tides become\nstronger at this altitude, diurnal loss due to horizontal advec-\ntion increases. The contribution from diurnal mean vertical\nadvection is positive due to net downward motion, though it\nseems to lag behind the loss due to horizontal advection. This\nwould be consistent with increased chemical loss in verti-\ncally displaced parcels of air as the increased tides first prop-\nagate into this region. As the concentration of O falls, this\neffect would decrease, and the positive contribution of ver-\ntical advection would catch up with the negative horizontal\nterms. The chemical and meridional advection production-\nloss terms slowly increase, acting to slow the rate of loss of\nOx. With respect to chemistry, this is consistent with the\nlower Ox concentrations, leading to decreased recombina-\ntion. This results in an overall increase in chemical produc-\ntion, since the solar dissociation production of O is largely\nunaffected by increased tides. The slow increase in merid-\nional advection is consistent with falling concentrations at\nthe equator. This acts to reduce the latitudinal gradient Ox,\nwhich, in turn, decreases the magnitude of the loss due to net\noutward flow from the equator.\nThe change in the mean temperature with increased tidal\nforcing was shown in Fig. 10 (top). Although the changes are\nsmall, it is interesting to note the processes responsible, since\nthey highlight the complexity of the coupling mechanisms in\nthe MLT region. Analysis of the production and loss terms in\nthe CMAT energy equation show that the decrease in temper-\nature between 90\u2013110 km and the increase below 90 km are\nM. J.

The global mean val-\nues shown are in reasonable agreement with previous studies\n(Mlynczak and Solomon, 1993; Reis et al., 1994; Ward and\nFomichev, 1993; Zhu et al., 1999). Increased tides deplete O\nin the 90\u2013110 km region, and increase it below 90 km. This\nleads to a decrease in chemical heating between 90\u2013100 km\nand an increase below 90 km, with corresponding changes in\ntemperature. Similar runs with chemical heating deactivated\nabove 75 km show similar temperature variations due to in-\ncreased tides, but with a smaller magnitude. The remain-\ning variations with chemical heating deactivated are due to\nchanges in advection. Similar to the changes in mean O, be-\nlow 90 km, the increase in temperature is due to an increase\nin the positive contribution of the vertical advection term,\nwhereas between 90\u2013110 km, there is an increased cooling\ndue to horizontal advection.\n5 Conclusions\nSimilar runs to those carried out by Roble and Shepherd\n(1997) have been made with a new mesosphere and thermo-\nsphere general circulation model. CMAT was able to simu-\nlate many diurnal tidal features observed in the MLT region.\nThe runs suggest that tides act to reduce the peak in mean\nO density at the equator, but not sufficiently so that the diur-\n \nFig. 13.

Changes in mean circulation induced by\ntidal dissipation would appear to have a strong influence on\nmean O. Analysis of the diurnal mean production-loss terms\nin the Ox continuity equation at 16 N, 98 km show that the\nhorizontal advection components are of similar magnitude to\nthe vertical component. Changes in mean temperature were\ninfluenced by both changes in exothermic chemical heating\nassociated with changes in the O distribution and mean cir-\nculation.\nCMAT is still in a relatively formative stage, and will be\nsubject to future improvements. As discussed previously, the\nshortfall in diurnal tidal amplitude, and the discrepancies be-\ntween modelled and observed zonal mean wind and tempera-\nture, are most likely due to the representation of gravity wave\ndrag in the model. This will be addressed with the update to\na more sophisticated parameterisation, such as that of Hines\n(1997a, b).\nAcknowledgement. The authors wish to thank I. C. F.
