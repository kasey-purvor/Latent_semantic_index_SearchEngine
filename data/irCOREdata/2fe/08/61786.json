Particle acceleration consequences from fluctuating electric fields superposed on an X-type magnetic field in collisionless\nsolar plasma are studied. Such a system is chosen to mimic generic features of dynamic reconnection, or the reconnective\ndissipation of a linear disturbance.\nAims. Explore numerically the consequences for charged particle distributions of fluctuating electric fields superposed on an\nX-type magnetic field.\nMethods. Particle distributions are obtained by numerically integrating individual charged particle orbits when a time varying\nelectric field is superimposed on a static X-type neutral point. This configuration represents the effects of the passage of a\ngeneric MHD disturbance through such a system. Different frequencies of the electric field are used, representing different\npossible types of wave. The electric field reduces with increasing distance from the X-type neutral point as in linear dynamic\nmagnetic reconnection.\nResults. The resulting particle distributions have properties that depend on the amplitude and frequency of the electric\nfield. In many cases a bimodal form is found.

Acceleration of particles \u2013 Waves \u2013 Sun: flares \u2013 Sun: X-rays, gamma rays\n1. Introduction\nRelease of stored magnetic energy via particle accelera-\ntion is a characteristic feature of astrophysical plasmas.\nIn the particular case of the Sun, we see this manifested\nin the catastrophic events of flares, as well as in quieter\nphenomena like radio noise storms. Similar phenomena\nare observed in other late-type stars, and similar physics\nmay be involved in understanding a wide variety of astro-\nphysical objects (see e.g. Kuijpers 1993, Hanasz and Lesch\n2003).\nThe special case of solar flares involves particular chal-\nlenges to theory. A large fraction (several tens of percent)\nof the flare energy is manifested initially in the form of\nfast electrons (accelerated out of the background distribu-\ntion to \u223c100 keV in about 1 second and to \u223c 100 MeV\nin a few seconds), which reveal their presence by produc-\ning bremsstrahlung X-rays (e.g. Miller 1998; MacKinnon\n2006). Protons are accelerated in flares to energies of sev-\nSend offprint requests to: P. Petkaki\neral tens of MeVs in a timescale of one second (Miller\n1998, Aschwanden 2002). Thus the acceleration of parti-\ncles is an important part of the energy release process,\nrather than an energetically unimportant consequence of\nthe flare. Moreover, radio signatures (Type I noise storms,\nType III bursts away from flares) testify to particle accel-\neration at \u201dquiet\u201d times.\nMagnetic reconnection is one of the primary candi-\ndate mechanisms for releasing non-potential energy from\nmagnetized plasmas (e.g. Priest and Forbes 2001). The\nelectric field in the current-carrying region also makes it\na natural particle accelerator. Collision-dominated sheets\nwill involve the production of some runaway particles,\nbut almost by definition particle acceleration is not a pri-\nmary consequence of such a situation (e.g. Smith 1980).\nHowever, Martens (1988) gave order-of-magnitude argu-\nments in favor of a collisionless current sheet as both the\nenergy release mechanism and the particle accelerator in\nflares. Particle acceleration is energetically the primary\nconsequence of such a situation. Collisionless reconnection\n2 Petkaki & MacKinnon: Time-Varying Electric Field\nthus assumes great potential importance in understanding\nthe flare process, particle acceleration, energy conversion\nand release in astrophysical plasmas generally (Petkaki\nand MacKinnon 1997; Heerikhuisen et al. 2002; Hamilton\net al. 2003; Turkmani et al. 2006; Wood and Neukirch\n2005; Vainchtein et al. 2005; McClements et al. 2006).\nHere we present test particle calculations designed to\nilluminate the consequences for particle acceleration of dy-\nnamic reconnection. We have in mind particularly the pic-\nture of Craig and McClymont (1991, 1993), in which a lin-\near disturbance passes through a magnetic configuration\ncontaining an X-type neutral point. The disturbance trav-\nels non-dissipatively with the local Alfve\u00b4n speed until it\napproaches the dissipation region surrounding the neutral\npoint, where the resistive diffusion term in the induction\nequation becomes important. The wave damps resistively\nin a few system transit times, with consequences (heating\nor particle acceleration) determined by the physical nature\nof the resistivity. Several assumptions were made in Craig\nand McClymont\u2019s original discussion (linear disturbance,\ncold plasma limit, 2-D, Ohm\u2019s law including only a scalar\nresistivity) but this essential picture still affords a quali-\ntative guide in more complex situations (e.g. McClymont\nand Craig 1996; Senanayake and Craig 2006).\nIn Petkaki and MacKinnon (1997), we examined the\nbehavior of protons in the presence of electric and mag-\nnetic fields obtained from the Craig and McClymont\n(1991) analysis. Here we carry out a complementary ex-\nercise, studying test particle evolution in the presence of\nsimple fields chosen to mimic generic features of dynamic\nreconnection. Our aim is to comment on particle accel-\neration consequences, in a parametric way that does not\ndepend on a particular set of simplifying physical assump-\ntions or boundary conditions. Time-dependence of the\nelectric field is the essential ingredient reflecting the dy-\nnamic character of the reconnection. We present examples\nof distributions resulting from a time-independent electric\nfield for comparison and highlight distinct features of the\ndistributions resulting from dynamic situations.\nWe use the Craig and McClymont (1991) linear solu-\ntion as a qualitative guide for the spatial and temporal\nform of the electric field. Our adopted field also resem-\nbles a linear situation in displaying a time dependence\nthat does not change (i.e. does not develop multiple fre-\nquencies, saturate, etc.). Basing our calculations on this\nlinear picture makes it unlikely that they will provide a\ncomplete description of what happens in a flare, although\nthey offer useful insight. They may however be particu-\nlarly relevant to non-flaring particle acceleration, e.g. in\nsolar noise storms, or as part of the explanation of \u2019quies-\ncent\u2019 radio emission seen from RS CVn binaries (Kuijpers\n& van der Hulst 1985).\nSince we aim to emulate a linear situation we may pick\nour test particles from an isotropic, homogeneous distri-\nbution representing the background. This is in contrast\nto particle studies of nonlinear reconnection, where con-\nsistency demands consideration of the motion of particles\ninto the dissipation region. In most studies particles are\ninjected in two opposite quadrupoles of the X-point and\nthey subsequently are driven, by the E\n\u00af\n\u00d7B\n\u00af\ndrift due to an\nimposed constant electric field, to cross the nonadiabatic\nregion or miss it depending on their initial conditions (see\ne.g. Burkhart et al. 1990).\nMany previous studies of test particle evolution in\nsteady reconnection exist. Here we mention particularly\nthe work of Martin (1986), which demonstrates that the\norbits of such test particles are chaotic, and of Burkhart\net al. (1990, 1991) who iterated from the test parti-\ncle calculations to construct a self-consistent descrip-\ntion of the diffusion region. Recent work studies regular\nand chaotic dynamics in 3-D reconnecting current sheets\n(Efthymiopoulos et al. 2005; Gontikakis et al. 2006) or\nstudies particle orbits in the presence of 3-D magnetic\nnulls (Heerikhuisen et al. 2002; Dalla and Browning 2005).\nParticularly relevant here is the exploratory, analytical\nstudy of Litvinenko (2003) which looks at charged par-\nticle orbits in an oscillating electric field in a magnetic\nfield containing a neutral line.\nThe next section gives details of the specific model\nwe adopt in order to study particle acceleration in time-\ndependent reconnection, while Section 3 describes our re-\nsults for particle distributions. Section 4 discusses some\npossible implications of our results.\n2. Model for Particle Acceleration in fluctuating\nelectric fields\nWe are going to study the evolution of test particles in the\npresence of electromagnetic fields chosen to mimic generic\nfeatures of dynamic reconnection. Time-dependence of the\nelectric field reflects the dynamic character of the recon-\nnection.\n2.1. Equations of motion\nWe solve numerically the relativistic equations of motions\nof test particles (particles are expected to acquire rela-\ntivistic velocities) in electromagnetic fields and in the ob-\nserver\u2019s reference frame:\ndr\n\u00af\ndt\n=\np\n\u00af\nm\u03b3\n(1)\ndp\n\u00af\ndt\n= q(E\n\u00af\n+\n1\nc\n(u\n\u00af\n\u00d7 B\n\u00af\n)) (2)\nwhere \u03b3 = (1\u2212 (u\/c)2)\u22121\/2, u\n\u00af\n= p\n\u00af\n\/m\u03b3.\nTo model the reconnection magnetic field, we adopt an\nidealized 2-D magnetic field containing an X-type neutral\npoint:\nB\n\u00af\n=\nB0\nD\n(yx\u02c6 + xy\u02c6). (3)\nThe current density vanishes for this field configuration.\nThe field lines are the solutions of dxdy =\ny\nx which are hy-\nperbolae y2 \u2212 x2 = const. The X-line (neutral line) lies\nPetkaki & MacKinnon: Time-Varying Electric Field 3\nalong the z-axis. The field strength depends on position\nthus:\n|B\n\u00af\n| = B0 r\nD\n(4)\nwhere x2 + y2 = r2. Note that this configuration has no\nnatural scale length. Requiring the field to have a value\nof 102 gauss at a typical active region distance of 109 cm\nfrom the neutral point, fixes only B0\/D = 10\n\u22127 gauss\ncm\u22121. We are free to use other considerations to fix one\nof B0 and D independently, as we do below in introduc-\ning dimensionless variables. An electric field is imposed in\nthe z direction, with spatial and temporal form chosen to\nmimic qualitative features of dynamic reconnection (see\nSec. 2.2).\nWe normalize distances toDn and times to the gyrope-\nriod at r = Dn. We denote the resulting timescales by \u03c4p\nand \u03c4e for the cases of electrons and protons respectively.\nAs noted above, Dn is as yet undetermined. It turns out to\nbe convenient in this relativistic calculation to choose Dn\nsuch that velocities are normalized to the speed of light.\nThis has the consequence that Dn takes different values\nDe = c\n\u221a\n(meD\/eB0) and Dp = c\n\u221a\n(mpD\/eB0) for elec-\ntrons and protons respectively (Petkaki and MacKinnon,\n1994, Petkaki, 1996), such that\nDp = (\nmp\nme\n)\n1\n2De. (5)\nSpecifically, with Bo\/D = 10\n\u22127, we findDe = 1.3\u00d7105 cm\nand Dp = 5.6\u00d7 106 cm. With our choices of E\n\u00af\nand B\n\u00af\nthe\nLorentz equations (1) and (2) become in three dimensions\nand in dimensionless units:\ndx\u00af\ndt\u00af\n= u\u00afx =\np\u00afx\n\u03b3\ndy\u00af\ndt\u00af\n= u\u00afy =\np\u00afy\n\u03b3\ndz\u00af\ndt\u00af\n= u\u00afz =\np\u00afz\n\u03b3\ndp\u00afx\ndt\u00af\n= \u2212\u000fx\u00afu\u00afz\ndp\u00afy\ndt\u00af\n= \u000fy\u00afu\u00afz\ndp\u00afz\ndt\u00af\n= E\u00af + \u000f(x\u00afu\u00afx + y\u00afu\u00afy) (6)\nwhere \u03b3 = (1 + px\n2 + py\n2 + pz\n2)\n1\n2 and \u000f = +1 for protons,\n\u000f = \u22121 for electrons. E(r\n\u00af\n, t) is the true value of the electric\nfield and E\u00af = E(D\/Bo)Di is the dimensionless electric\nfield, with subscript i taking the values e for electrons or\np for protons. Energies are now normalised to the particle\nrest mass energy so that kinetic energy in dimensionless\nunits is just Kkin = \u03b3\u22121. Equations (6) with appropriate\ninitial conditions and a specific form for E\u00af describe the\nmotion of a particle.\n2.2. Electric Field\nCraig and McClymont (1991) guide us in adopting a func-\ntional form of electric field which allows us to investigate\nconsequences of time-dependence in a parametric way.\nTheir resistively damping, linear disturbance involves a\nregularly oscillating electric field whose amplitude is great-\nest in the region near the neutral point where the resistive\nterm of the induction equation becomes important. Far\nfrom this region the disturbance is Alfv\u2019enic in character\nand dominated by the boundary conditions, so that the\nelectric field amplitude always maximises in the central,\ndiffusion region (see also Petkaki and MacKinnon 1997,\nSection 3). Thus we adopt the following form for the elec-\ntric field E\n\u00af\n:\nE\n\u00af\n= E0 sin(\u03c9t)z\u02c6f(x, y) (7)\nwhere f(x, y) describes the spatial variation of E\n\u00af\n. We take\nf(x, y) = exp(\u2212\u03b1i\u221a(|r|)) (8)\nwhere, \u03b1p = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22121, \u03b1e = 3.776 \u00d7 10\u22122, |r| =\u221a\n(x2 + y2). Consistent with our concentration on par-\nticle acceleration near the neutral point and with in situ\nmeasurements in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere (\u00d8ieroset et al.,\n2001), we expect that resistivity will be primarily inertial\nin character (Speiser 1970). As shown in Figure 1, this\nform approximates the radial form of the electric field cal-\nculated from the Craig and McClymont (1991) solution,\nfor an (inertial) resistivity \u03b7 estimated assuming the dom-\ninant contribution from 1 keV protons (see Petkaki and\nMacKinnon 1997, Section 3; Speiser, 1970). The form of\nthe electric field is shown in Figure 1 at t = 0. The ex-\nact Craig and McClymont solution develops more com-\nplex spatial structure but the spatial form of Eq. (8) thus\nembodies a dissipation region on the appropriate length\nscale.\nThe frequency of oscillation of the electric field which\nwe denote by \u03c9 is a free parameter. Each simulation uses\none value of \u03c9. We take values of \u03c9 such that 1\/1000 <\n\u03c9 < 10000, corresponding to a broadband wave spectrum\nwhich may propagate in such a system (see Petkaki and\nMackinnon 1997).\nTo compare with a simple, unvarying state, we also cal-\nculate the energy distributions that result from a constant\nin time imposed electric field\nE\n\u00af\n= E0z\u02c6f(x, y) (9)\nwhere f(x, y) is defined in Equation 8. With its nonzero\ncurl, this assumed form of E cannot represent a steady\nstate reconnection. We employ it primarily to provide a\nsimple, unvarying state for comparison with results in the\ntime-dependent situation.\nKey to understanding particle behaviour near the neu-\ntral point is the \u2018adiabaticity\u2019 radius rad, the distance from\nthe neutral point at which the Larmor radius equals the\nmagnetic field scale length. For r > rad, particles move\n4 Petkaki & MacKinnon: Time-Varying Electric Field\nFig. 1. Electric field (solid line) calculated from the Craig and\nMcClymont (1991) solution for inertial resistivity \u03b7 = 3.1724\u00d7\n10\u221211 and for the fundamental mode of azimuthal symmetry\n(n=0) at t=0. Approximate electric field described in Equation\n8 is shown in dotted line at t=0.\nadiabatically. In other words, if the distance of the parti-\ncle from the neutral point is of the order of its Larmor ra-\ndius, then the particle is non-adiabatic. The \u2018adiabaticity\u2019\nradius depends on the particle mass and velocity perpen-\ndicular to the magnetic field, u\u22a5, and is given by\nrad = (\nmcDu\u22a5\neBo\n)\n1\n2 . (10)\nFor electrons and protons of the same energy, the electron\ngyroradius is (memp )\n1\n2 smaller than the proton gyroradius.\n2.3. Numerical Method\nDue to the complexity of the orbits, their calculation can-\nnot be done analytically. For integrating the ordinary dif-\nferential equations (ODEs) describing the motion of the\nparticles, we use the Bulirsch-Stoer method (Press et al.\n1996). For a single particle with the same initial condi-\ntions, the orbit changes if the accuracy required of the in-\ntegration routine is varied, and when the particle crosses\nthe neutral point area (for general properties of X-type\nneutral point orbits see e.g. Martin 1986). The statistical\nproperties of the distribution of test particles, which are of\nprimary interest here, are unaffected by changes in the ac-\ncuracy required of the integration routine. In the absence\nof an electric field, the routine conserves particle energy\nto one part in 10\u22125.\nWe start the integration of particle orbits at t=0 and\nwith the particles positioned randomly in a box with the\nfollowing size\n\u22121.0 \u2264 x0 \u2264 1.0 (11)\n\u22121.0 \u2264 y0 \u2264 1.0 (12)\nz0 = 0.0 (13)\nin electron or proton units depending on the species. We\nintegrate the particle orbits up to 230400 timesteps (\u03c4e) for\nelectrons and 5360 (\u03c4p) for protons. With B0\/D = 10\n\u22127\nand our form of dimensionless units these times corre-\nspond to 1 second for electrons and protons. The ini-\ntial velocities of the particles are picked randomly from a\nMaxwellian distribution of temperature 5\u00d7 106K (\u223c 431\neV), a typical coronal value. We consider only small val-\nues for E\u00af0, consistent with the passage of a disturbance in\nthe linear regime (Craig and McClymont, 1991). Values of\n0.0001, 0.001 and 0.01 are used in the actual calculation.\nThe value 0.001 corresponds to electric field = 5.88\u00d710\u22124\nstatvolt\/cm. These are moderate values for electric fields\npresent in the solar atmosphere (see Foukal et al., 1986).\n2.4. Particle Orbits\nWe are going to examine a typical proton orbit which is\nshown in Figure 2. The amplitude of the time-varying elec-\ntric field is E\u00af0 = 0.001 and the frequency is \u03c9 = 0.2. In\nFig. 2a we plot the (dimensionless) energy of the proton\nas a function of time for the interval 2400-5360 \u03c4p. In Fig.\n2b is shown the projection of the same orbit on the X-\nY plane and in Fig. 2c the projection of the same orbit\non the X-Z plane. Our model assumes a system scale of\n\u223c 178Dp, corresponding to a typical active region scale of\n109 cm. In Fig. 2b we zoom in close to the neutral point\nto observe the particle orbit in detail and we look in an\narea of \u22121.0Dp < x\u00af < 1.0Dp and \u22121.0Dp < y\u00af < 1.0Dp. In\nthe same figure superposed in dotted line are some of the\nmagnetic field lines showing the structure of the X-type\nmagnetic neutral point. All field lines tend to the sepa-\nratrices (shown in dashed lines) as the distance from the\nneutral point becomes very large.\nThe thick solid circle has radius d = 10rad for a ther-\nmal proton. Inside this region the gyroradius (Larmor ra-\ndius) of most particles is not well defined since the par-\nticle is not bound to one magnetic field line and mean-\ndering motion is observed. The electric field accelerates\nor decelerates the proton causing further changes in the\nparticle gyroradius and energy. This behavior resembles\na stochastic-type acceleration. Stochasticity is introduced\nby the phase of the electric field and the phase of the\nparticle orbit and is sustained because of the form of the\nmagnetic field (e.g. Martin 1986). Outside the magnetic\nneutral point area the particle is moving along a partic-\nular magnetic field line. The gyroradius and the paral-\nlel velocity decrease as the particle moves away from the\nneutral point. The particle mirrors and recrosses the non-\nadiabatic region and the process is repeated until the end\nof the integration time or until the particle escapes the\nouter boundary of the system (x, y \u2265 178Dp).\nLooking back at Fig. 2a we see the variation of the par-\nticle energy as a function of time. The intervals of energy\nconservation correspond to the times the particle is away\nfrom the nonadiabatic region, and in regions where the\nPetkaki & MacKinnon: Time-Varying Electric Field 5\nelectric field is decreasing. Changes in the particle energy\ntake place during the crossing of the non-adiabatic region.\nThe orbits of electrons show similar properties to that\nof the protons. Additionally from the way we pick our\ninitial conditions the electrons start closer to the neutral\npoint (see Sect. 2.2). But since the form of the electric\nfield for both species is calculated assuming proton inertial\nresistivity, electrons see an area much larger than their\nadiabaticity radius where the electric field is close to its\nmaximum value. Consequently some of the electrons start\ntheir motion outside their adiabaticity radius and their\nmotion is immediately adiabatic. In this case the presence\nof the electric field does not increase their energy except\nif they eventually cross the non-adiabatic region.\nThe amount of acceleration that particles get depends\non the time they spend close to the neutral point, on the\nphase of the orbit and on the frequency of the electric field.\nWe define crossing time as the time the particle needs to\ncross the non-adiabatic region (Sec. 2.2) and is given to\norder of magnitude by\ntcr \u223c 2rad\nux,y\n(14)\nwhere ux,y is the velocity projection in the x-y plane. So,\ntcr \u223c (2.828cD\neBo\n)\n1\/2m\n3\/4\ni\nE1\/4\n. (15)\nIt turns out that particles with the same energy satisfy\ntcrp = tcre(\nme\nmp\n)\n3\n4 = 280tcre (16)\nwhere tcrp is the proton crossing time and tcre is the elec-\ntron crossing time. One would expect that in order to get\nparticles effectively accelerated (or decelerated since the\nsign of the electric field is not constant) we need tE \u001d tcr\nwhere tE = 1\/\u03c9 is the period of fluctuation of the elec-\ntric field. Thus we see potential for differences between\nelectron and ion acceleration.\n3. Energy Distributions of Accelerated Electrons\nand Protons\nWe calculate the kinetic energy of each particle up to max-\nimum of a 1 second real time along with final positions\nand velocities. Particles in our calculation spend a rela-\ntively short time close to the neutral point but they get\ntrapped in the magnetic configuration and re-cross the\nneutral point a number of times (Sect. 2.4). Particles en-\ncounter the non-adiabatic region, the process resulting in\na Fermi-type acceleration. A similar phenomenon has been\nnoted for a multiple neutral point configuration by Kliem\n(1994), in the behavior of protons in the presence of an\nMHD disturbance by Petkaki and Mackinnon (1997), and\nwas explored analytically for time-varying electric field by\nLitvinenko (2003).\nWe sample the electric field frequency range 0.001 <\n\u03c9 < 100 for protons and 0.005 < \u03c9 < 1000 for electrons.\nIn Fig. 3 we plot histograms of the logarithm of the ini-\ntial and final energy distributions of protons, for magni-\ntude of the electric field E\u00af0 = 0.001 and total number of\ntimesteps 5360. Each distribution is generated using 50000\ntest protons. We also calculated the distributions resulting\nwhen the magnitude of the electric field is E\u00af0 = 0.01 and\nE\u00af0 = 0.0001. The initial Maxwellian distribution is shown\nin dotted lines in each panel. Panel (1) shows the distribu-\ntions for electric field magnitude E\u00af0 = 0. We observe no\nchange in the form of the distribution since no acceleration\nis taking place (see also Sect. 2.3). Panel (2) shows the en-\nergy distributions for constant electric field (\u03c9 = 0) to pro-\nvide a comparison with steady state magnetic reconnec-\ntion. The final energy distribution for \u03c9 = 0 has two dis-\ntinct peaks, one at the initial Maxwellian distribution and\na beamlike distribution close to Kkin = 10 MeV. The en-\nergy distributions for constant electric field are not power\nlaws as found elsewhere (see e.g. Bulanov and Sasarov\n1976; Bruhwiler and Zweibel 1992). In those former calcu-\nlations the particles crossed the neutral point only once,\nwhereas particles recross the neutral point numerous times\nin our model. The frequency of the time-varying electric\nfield increases progressively from \u03c9 = 0.001 in panel (3)\nto \u03c9 = 10 in panel (12). For \u03c9 = 0.001 a small beamlike\nstructure appears at Kkin = 0.3 MeV. The final energy\ndistributions are bi-modal from \u03c9 = 0.01 to \u03c9 = 10. For\nhigher frequencies the proton energy distributions do not\nshow significant energy changes.\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the mean of the logarithm of the ini-\ntial and final proton energy distributions versus the fre-\nquency of the electric field and for three amplitudes of the\nelectric field E\u00af0 = 0.0001 (dashed star line), E\u00af0 = 0.001\n(solid star line), and E\u00af0 = 0.01 (dotted star line). The\nmean energy for the constant electric field is represented\non this plot by \u03c9 = 10\u22124. The same representation is used\nin Fig. 5 where we plot the standard deviation of the log-\narithm of the initial and final proton energy distributions\nversus \u03c9 for the same three amplitudes of the electric field\nas in Fig. 4. We use the mean value of the logarithm of\nthe energy to better represent the changes in highly non-\nthermal distributions.\nThe mean energy increases monotonically with E\u00af0 for\nthe constant electric field case and for all frequencies of the\nelectric field except for the highest frequency used in our\nmodel. The highest mean energy is achieved for constant\nelectric field for all values of the electric field. For E\u00af0 =\n0.0001 the highest energy gain for the time-varying electric\nfield is achieved when 0.2 < \u03c9 < 2.0, indicating a resonant\nacceleration process. For E\u00af0 = 0.001 a peak in the mean\nenergy is also present when 0.2 < \u03c9 < 2.0. For E\u00af0 = 0.001\nprotons gain most energy from the low \u03c9 electric field\n(see Fig. 4). When E\u00af0 = 0.01 protons a peak in the mean\nenergy is present when 0.01 < \u03c9 < 2.0. For frequency \u03c9 =\n10 and greater the energy distribution does not change\nsignificantly for all values of E\u00af0.\nIn Fig. 6 we plot histograms of the logarithm of the\ninitial and final energy distributions of electrons, for mag-\nnitude of the electric field E\u00af0 = 0.001 and total num-\n6 Petkaki & MacKinnon: Time-Varying Electric Field\nFig. 3.

Again we generate each distri-\nbution using 50000 test electrons, and show the initial\nMaxwellian distribution in dotted lines in each panel.\nPanel (1) shows the energy distributions for non-varying\nelectric field (\u03c9 = 0). The final energy distribution (shown\nin solid line) includes a small beamlike component. The\nlower energy part of the final distribution is Maxwellian-\nlike peaking at kinetic energy Kkin = 10\n\u22121 MeV, with a\nsmall beamlike component superposed at around kinetic\nenergy Kkin = 1 MeV. The frequency of the time-varying\nelectric field increases progressively from \u03c9 = 0.001 (panel\n2) to \u03c9 = 500 (panel 12). The bulk of the distribu-\ntion is accelerated for the frequency range \u03c9 = 0.001 to\n\u03c9 = 50.

From \u03c9 = 5\n(panel 7) to \u03c9 = 20 (panel 9) the accelerated distribu-\ntions have maximum close to \u223c Kkin = 0.1 MeV with\nmaximum energy exceeding to 1 MeV. The final energy\ndistributions are bi-modal for \u03c9 = 50 to \u03c9 = 500 con-\ntaining a Maxwellian-like part at the energy range of the\ninitial Maxwellian distribution and an accelerated part at\nhigher energies with peak in the range \u223c Kkin = 0.03 to\n\u223c Kkin = 0.7 MeV. For higher frequencies the energy dis-\ntributions do not show significant energy changes in the\ntime of maximum 1 s.\nThe electron distribution gains energy for most of the\nfrequencies of the electric field that we used in this model\nexcept for the highest frequencies. In Fig. 7 we plot the\nmean of the logarithm of the electron energy distribu-\ntions versus \u03c9 for two amplitudes of the electric field\nE\u00af0 = 0.0001 (dashed star line), E\u00af0 = 0.001 (solid star\nline). In the same plot we superposed as error the standard\ndeviation in the mean for each distribution. The mean en-\nergy for the constant electric field is represented on this\nplot by \u03c9 = 10\u22123. The highest energy gain achieved is\nfor electric field with \u03c9 = 50 for amplitude of the electric\nfield E\u00af0 = 0.001. When E\u00af0 = 0.0001 electrons gain most\nenergy for the constant electric field and for \u03c9 = 50.\nIn the Tables that follow we summarized the energy\ngain aspects of the acceleration mechanism. For each par-\nticle we find the energy gain using its initial and final\nkinetic energy, that is:\n\u2206Ki\nKiinitial\n=\nKifinal \u2212Kiinitial\nKiinitial\n(17)\nwhere Kiinitial is the initial energy of the i-th parti-\ncle and Kifinal is the final energy of the i-th particle.\n\u2206Ki\/Kiinitial = A, where A takes the values 1, 10, 100.\nIn Table 1 we list the accelerated percentage of the final\nproton distribution for each electric field frequency and for\nE0 = 0.001. The first column lists the frequencies of the\nelectric field. The second, third and fourth columns list\nthe percentage of the final proton distribution for which\nA is greater than 1, 10 and 100 respectively (Eq. 17). The\nfifth column lists the percentage of the final proton distri-\nbution that has energy greater than 1 MeV and the last\ncolumn list the highest energy in the final proton distri-\nbution in MeV. We see that depending on the frequency\nof the electric field, \u223c 0.2% to \u223c 17.9% of the proton dis-\ntributions get accelerated to \u03b3-ray producing energies in\n1 s.\nIn Tables 2 and 3 we list the accelerated percentage\nof the final proton distribution for each available electric\nfield frequency for E0 = 0.0001 and for E0 = 0.01.

Although we can account for particle ac-\nceleration in this way, to very high energies, we have to\nappeal to some other agent to redistribute energy among\nthe accelerated particles to be compatible with observa-\ntions. Very hard energy distributions are also found in\nmost other calculations of acceleration in either one or\nmany dissipation regions (e.g. Turkmani et al., 2006).\nBy fixing the duration of the integrations at 1 second\nwe generate a snapshot of the distributions produced as\nparticle acceleration proceeds. Obviously, particle energies\nwill be less for shorter periods and greater for longer ones.\nAs an illustration, in Figure 8 we plot the time evolution of\nthe logarithm of the mean energy of proton distributions\nfor E\u00af0 = 0.0001, as functions of \u03c9. Mean energy is plotted\nfor 0.25 s (1340 \u03c4p), 1 s, and 2 s (10720 \u03c4p). We observe that\nthe greatest changes in mean proton energy take place for\nthe lowest frequencies \u03c9. At high frequencies, on the other\nhand, proton mean energy apparently changes little after 1\ns. A sort of steady state is approached. Since no particles\nescape, this indicates a decrease with proton energy of\nthe energy increment experienced on each return to the\ndissipation region: protons that can be accelerated at all\nno longer gain much energy after this time.\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nIn this work we investigate the particle acceleration con-\nsequences of time-varying electric fields superposed on a\nX-type magnetic field to mimic generic features of dy-\nnamic, collisionless reconnection (Craig and McClymont\n1991). We have shown that protons and electrons may gain\nrelativistic energies in times \u22641 s; for plausible (small)\nelectric field amplitudes and active region magnetic fields.\nThis parametric study is meant to be complementary to\nPetkaki and MacKinnon (1997) where we attempted to\ntie this test-particle approach self-consistently to an MHD\ndescription of the passage of a wave. Although there are\nsome qualitative similarities with the particle behaviour\nstudied analytically by Litvinenko (2003), his adoption of\na spatially uniform electric field makes direct comparison\ndifficult.\nBefore discussing some consequences of our results, we\nnote some limitations of our calculation. First, this is a\ntest particle approach. Particles do not interact with each\nother, nor do they influence the background field. In par-\nticular, the particle distribution including the accelerated\ncomponent may well be unstable to growth of various sorts\nof waves. Obviously such wave growth would influence the\nmotion of particles, but we neglect this possibility. We ne-\nglect also radiation losses. In the solar corona this is not\na serious neglect (even for 10 MeV electrons the radiative\nenergy loss time is \u223c 3000 s), but elsewhere in the cosmos\nit could become significant.\nWe followed Craig and McClymont (1991) in assuming\na smoothly varying X-type field through the whole of our\nsystem. We took the active region lengthscale of 109 cm\nto define the boundary of the system. It is possible that\nthe field strength increases more rapidly from the neutral\npoint, approaching a constant value at smaller distance.\nThis would reduce both the adiabaticity radii of parti-\ncles and the characteristic timescale. If we continued to\nscale the electric field region with the proton adiabatic-\nity radius, nothing would change except that the integra-\ntion periods correspond to smaller real times. Thus par-\nticle acceleration would proceed more rapidly; however,\nfewer particles would be involved. Further consideration\nof this question might proceed via study of more realis-\ntic configurations including a neutral point or sheet (e.g.\nForbes and Priest 1995; Fletcher & Martens 1998; Titov\nand De\u00b4moulin 1999) or complex magnetic field structures\n(e.g. Malara et al. 2000).\nThe finite width of the nonadiabatic region allows par-\nticles to gain or lose some energy randomly before re-\nturning to adiabatic motion. Together with repeated en-\ncounters with the dissipation region, the consequence of\nmirrorings in the extended configuration, this results in a\nFermi-type, \u2019stochastic\u2019 acceleration.\nIn our model particle acceleration takes place for geo-\nmetrical reasons. The test particle calculation is numeri-\ncally simpler than self-consistent approaches (e.g. Vlasov\nsimulations, see Petkaki et al. (2003, 2006) and gives use-\nful insights to the particle energization process. There is\n10 Petkaki & MacKinnon: Time-Varying Electric Field\nno threshold for this type of acceleration, unlike resonant\ninteraction with low-frequency, MHD waves. The neces-\nsity for protons particularly to have threshold energies\nof around 25 keV is a well known difficulty when such\nmechanisms are invoked (e.g. Forman et al., 1986). Our\nresults indicate that low-frequency waves may themselves\nperform the \u2019first-step\u2019 acceleration, if they propagate in\na coronal structure including a neutral point. This may\noccur independently of, or simultaneously with, the reso-\nnant cascade scenario of Miller and Vinas (1993). Possible\ndifficulties with the number of pre-accelerated particles\nmay be obviated if many neutral points are present, al-\nthough such a situation obviously needs separate investi-\ngation (Kliem 1994).\nMost of the resulting proton distributions have a bi-\nmodal form (see Fig. 3). Electron distributions are also\nbi-modal for the highest frequencies, 20 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 500 (see\nFig. 6). Whereas for the lowest frequencies of the elec-\ntric field the bulk of the initial electron Maxwellian dis-\ntribution is accelerated, for the highest frequencies only\npart of the electron distribution is accelerated (Table 4).\nAcceleration occurs for all frequencies \u03c9 \u2264 10 when ad-\ndressing the proton distributions (Table 1). The bi-modal\nform of the proton energy distributions might offer a way\nto have protons of gamma-ray producing energies (Kkin \u223c\n2 MeV) without the energetically dominant population at\nlower energies that is the inevitable consequence of a dif-\nfusive particle accelerator (see the Appendix of Eichler\n(1979); and MacKinnon (1991)). Investigation of the ve-\nlocity space stability of these distributions needs details\nof the angular distribution at particular points in space,\nand is not discussed here.\nWe note the effectiveness of acceleration of the two\nspecies varies according to the frequency of oscillation in-\nvoked. Electrons are accelerated for a broader spectrum\nof frequencies. Frequencies 0.001 to 1000 have been simu-\nlated here, corresponding to real frequencies in the range\n5 Hz to 5 MHz (cf. the frequency range of waves from the\nbase of the solar corona, probably in the range 0.01 Hz to\n10KHz, e.g. Marsch et al. (1982)). Frequencies lower than\n0.001 will also accelerate electrons as indicated by the net\nacceleration achieved for the constant electric field cases\n(Fig. 7), but frequencies higher than 1000 do not produce\na net acceleration in the timescale of our model.\nConsidered as a function of \u03c9, the mean energy of the\naccelerated electron distribution exhibits a peak in the\nbroad range 5 < \u03c9 < 100. Such a peak leads us to sus-\npect a resonance involving two or more of the timescales\nin the problem. The initial gyrofrequencies of electrons ly-\ning in the adiabatic portion of the dissipation region also\ngenerally lie in this range. Inverse crossing times (1\/tcr,\nsee Equation 14) comparable with \u03c9 might also lead to\nenhanced acceleration. Using Equation 14, but taking ac-\ncount also of the mean increase in ux,y we do indeed find\nupper limits in the range 5 < 1\/tcr < 100.\nProtons are accelerated for low electric field frequen-\ncies, achieving \u03b3-ray producing energies in 5360 \u03c4p = 1 s\nfor frequencies \u03c9 < 10 and for E0 = 0.001 and E0 = 0.01.\nA local peak in the mean energy of the accelerated proton\ndistribution is seen at 0.1 < \u03c9 < 2.0. This range of fre-\nquencies are comparable to the gyrofrequencies of protons\nin the adiabatic region for our set of initial conditions and\nto the proton inverse crossing time.\nThe variability of the effectiveness of acceleration of\nthe two species according to the frequency of electric field\noscillation might bear on the apparent variation of elec-\ntron\/proton ratios in flares (Ramaty & Murphy 1987) and\nthe phenomenon of \u2018electron-only\u2019 flares (Rieger 1989). As\na general comment, we note that higher frequency distur-\nbances favour electrons over ions, although more definitive\nstatements will need a proper treatment involving a more\nrealistic wave.\nFor most frequencies and for constant electric field,\npart of the electron distribution escapes from the system\nboundaries before 230400\u03c4e = 1 s. Electrons on average\nescape in less than 0.6 seconds in the frequency range 10 \u2264\n\u03c9 \u2264 50. Protons on the other hand do not escape the\nsystem boundaries on the same timescale of 5360\u03c4p = 1 s\nfor E0 = 0.001 and E0 = 0.0001. Electrons are accelerated\nmore rapidly than protons to energies that do not allow\nthem to mirror inside our system boundaries.\nHere and in Petkaki & MacKinnon (1997) we inves-\ntigate particle acceleration at a null in the presence of a\nlinear disturbance. Such calculations may give some in-\nsight into particle acceleration in flares, although condi-\ntions then presumably depart severely from linearity, but\nmight be most relevant to quiescent, long-lasting phe-\nnomena such as radio noise storms. Definitely involving\ndeka-keV electrons (Raulin & Klein, 1994) and showing\ncorrelations with X-ray variations, but without chromo-\nspheric, flare-like signatures (Svestka et al 1986; Crosby et\nal. 1996), particle acceleration in noise storms might occur\nas described here, if the relevant coronal structures include\nnull points. Electrons accelerated at a neutral point will\nlikely encounter very large mirror ratios, trapping them\nin the corona (Fletcher & Martens 1998) and account-\ning for the exclusively coronal phenomena accompanying\nnoise storms.\nReferences\nAschwanden M.J., 2002, Space Sci.
