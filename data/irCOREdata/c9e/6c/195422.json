Recently,\nsingle electron transistors have been built from these novel quantum dots [1],\nand detailed experimental measurements of the dot addition energy have been\nmade [1]. However, despite these advances, the physics of semiconductor NT\ndots is not well understood. We have developed a new 2-band effective mass\napproach to describe the states of a few interacting electrons in these dots.\nOur motivation is to understand the interacting states for a wide range of\nboth NT and dot parameters. In this paper we focus on the effect of the band\ncoupling on the 2-electron states and, interestingly, we find that when the\nband coupling is included, the 2-electron ground state can be ferromagnetic.\nWe consider gated NT dots similar to those studied by Jarillo-Herrero et al [1].\nIn our dot model electrons are confined electrostatically near the tube centre\nand the 1D dot confinement potential is harmonic [1,2]. We can write down an\neffective mass theory to describe the states of such a dot and there are some\n1 Corresponding author.

In all semiconducting\nNTs there are 2 equivalent conduction bands with minima at \u00b1ko. Within\nthe zone folding approximation these arise from the equivalence of the K and\nK \u2032 points in the graphene zone. The Coulomb interaction couples these bands\nand, to investigate the effect of this coupling, we derive a new effective mass\ntheory from the Hamiltonian of a graphene sheet.\nThe graphene Bloch states can be written in 2 component form in terms of\nthe Bloch functions \u03c6A and \u03c6B of the A,B sub-lattices of graphene, \u03c8k =\n(1\/\n\u221a\n2)e\u0131k\u00b7r(\u03c6A + (\u22121)ne\u0131\u03b8k\u03c6B) where n = 1, 0 for the valence or conduction\nband, and \u03b8k is a phase factor. We construct our NT states from these two\ncomponent Bloch functions. The key components of our theory are as follows.\nFirst, we include the Coulomb coupling between the NT states near K and\nK \u2032. Secondly, we ignore the coupling with the valence band, and this is valid\nbecause the dot energy scales (~\u03c9 \u223c meV) are much smaller than the band\ngap in a typical semiconductor NT (\u223c eV). The net result is a 1 dimensional,\n2-band effective mass theory with a modified Coulomb interaction. We obtain\nadditional terms in the interaction depending on the separation, \u03b4k = 1\/(3R),\nin k-space between the NT conduction band minima and the graphene K orK \u2032\npoints (R is the tube radius). The total interaction is u = (2v0(z, R) + v0(z \u2212\n3R,R)+v0(z+3R,R))\/4 for intraband scattering and u = S\n2\nK\u2212K\u2032(2vp(z, R)\u2212\nvp(z\u22123R,R)\u2212vp(z+3R,R))\/4 for interband processes, where z is the electron\nseparation, S2\nK\u2212K\u2032 is an atomic form factor (0 \u2264 S2 \u2264 1) and the Coulomb\nterm, vq, is defined in section 2. The integer, p, measures the separation in k\nbetween the two NT conduction bands in the direction parallel to the chiral\nvector of the tube. In a semiconducting (n,0) zigzag tube, p = 2(n\u00b1 1)\/3.\n2 Results\nWe diagonalise the NT quantum dot Hamiltonian, H =\n\u2211\nij\u3008i|ho|j\u3009c\u2020icj +\n(1\/2)\n\u2211\nijkl\u3008ij|u|kl\u3009c\u2020ic\u2020jckcl, to an accuracy of better than 0.1%. We are in-\nterested in a wide range of NT dots with many different parameters: for\nexample, different ~\u03c9, dielectric constant \u000fr, effective mass m\n\u2217 or tube ra-\ndius R. By writing the dot Hamiltonian in dimensionless form we can de-\nscribe this parameter space in terms of just 2 dimensionless parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2)\nwhen we neglect the interband coupling and 3 parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, p) when\nwe include it. We choose the energy unit to be Eu =\n3\n\u221a\n\u03c12m\u2217\u03c92\/\u000f2r and the\nlength unit to be \u03bb= 3\n\u221a\n\u03c1\/(\u000frm\u2217\u03c92) where \u03c1 = e\n2\/(4pi\u000fo). Then, with x=z\/\u03bb,\n\u03b13 = [\u03c12m\u2217\/(~3\u000f2r\u03c9)]\n2\nand \u03b2 = R\/\u03bb, we have ho = (\u22121\/2\u03b1)\u22072x + x2\/2 and\nvq(x, \u03b2) = (1\/2pi)\n\u222b\n( cos(2q\u03c6)\/\n\u221a\nx2 + 4\u03b22 cos2(\u03c6\/2) )d\u03c6. As we constrain the\nparameter space by 1 \u2264 \u000fr \u2264 7 and 1 \u2264 ~\u03c9 \u2264 50 meV the range of allowed \u03b1\ndepends on \u03b2.\n2\n 1.4\n 1.6\n 1.8\n 2\n 2.2\n 2.4\n 2.6\n 2.8\n 3\n 0.5  1  2  4  8  16  32\nEn\ner\ngy\n (E\nu\n)\n\u03b1\n\u03b2=0.025\n\u03b2=0.076\n\u03b2=0.128\n\u03b2=0.179\n\u03b2=0.231\n 0.005\n 0.01\n 0.015\n 0.02\n 0.025\n 0.5  1  2  4  8  16  32\nE(\nsp\nin \n0) \n- E\n(sp\nin \n1) \n(E\nu\n)\n\u03b1\n\u03b2=0.025\n\u03b2=0.076\n\u03b2=0.128\n\u03b2=0.179\n\u03b2=0.231\nFig. 1. Left: 4-fold degenerate, 2 electron ground state energy (S2 = 0). Right: Split-\nting of spin 1 and spin 0 states caused by the interband coupling (p = 3, S2 = 1).\nThe ground state energy (Fig 1 (left)) decreases with increasing \u03b1 as we would\nexpect: in the dimensionless Hamiltonian \u03b1 is analogous to a mass. When we\nneglect the coupling between the two bands, the band index acts like a pseu-\ndospin and the ground state is 4-fold degenerate. When we include the coupling\nterm the spin 0 and spin 1 ground states are split. Fig. 1 (right) shows the\nsplitting for a (10,0) NT (p = 3) and, by assuming S2 = 1, we have calcu-\nlated the maximum possible values for this splitting. The spin 1 state has the\nlowest energy because only the spin 1 state gets any benefit from the electron\nexchange. This does not contradict the Lieb-Mattis [3] theorem because our\nHamiltonian includes 2-bands. We have also calculated the splitting across the\nparameter space for p = 12, a (35,0) NT. In this case, the splitting is of the\norder of the numerical error in the energy (0.1%).\nOver the parameter space that we have investigated, the 2 electron ground\nstate is ferromagnetic. The magnitude of the spin 1 and spin 0 splitting is\nsmall (\u223c 1% of the ground state energy) but it is largest when p is small\n(small NTs) and smallest when the electrons are either very strongly (large\n\u03b1) or very weakly (small \u03b1) correlated.
