In this study, we show that GABA down-regulates the expression of a large sub-\nset of 14-3-3 gene family members in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in a calcium, ethylene \nand abscisic acid-dependent manner. Gene expression is not affected when seedlings are \nsupplied with glutamate, a precursor of GABA. The repression of 14-3-3 gene expression by \nGABA is dependent on functional ethylene and abscisic acid signalling pathways, since the \nresponse is lost in the etr1-1, abi1-1 and abi2-1 mutants. Calcium measurements show that in \ncontrast to glutamate, GABA does not elicit a cytoplasmic calcium elevation, suggesting that \nthe GABA response is unlikely to be mediated by glutamate receptors, as has been suggested \npreviously. We suggest that in addition to its role as a stress-related metabolite, GABA may \nregulate gene expression in Arabidopsis, including members of the 14-3-3 gene family. \n \nKeywords: 14-3-3 protein; GABA; Arabidopsis thaliana \n3 \nIntroduction \nAlthough nitrogen is thought to act as a signal in plants, very little is known about how this \noccurs (Lea & Miflin 2003). In animals and yeast, amino acids and their derivatives are \nthought to be important in nutrient signalling (Hyde, Taylor & Hundal 2003). In addition, the \namino acids glutamate, glycine, glutamine and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), have well-\nestablished roles as neurotransmitters in the mammalian central nervous system (Reimer et al. \n2001). It has been suggested that some of these nitrogen-containing molecules, including \nglutamate, glycine and GABA may also have potential signalling functions in plants (Lam et \nal. 1998; Bouch\u00e9, Lacombe & Fromm 2003; Dubos et al. 2003).  \n \nGABA is a non-protein amino acid that comprises a significant fraction of the free amino acid \npool in plant cells. GABA was first identified in plants over 50 years ago, but its significance \nremained obscure until the discovery that GABA levels are rapidly elevated in response to a \nrange of abiotic and biotic stresses, including pathogen infection, wounding, cold and heat \nshock, drought and hypoxia. Subsequently, a number of possible roles in plants for GABA \nand the GABA shunt, the pathway in which it is synthesised, have been proposed (Shelp, \nBrown & McLean 1999; Bouch\u00e9 & Fromm 2004). These range from regulation of cytosolic \npH and acting as a buffering mechanism in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, to protection \nagainst oxidative stress and defence against nematodes and herbivorous insects. Because of \nthe rapid increases in GABA concentration during these stresses, GABA has also been \nsuggested as a likely plant signalling molecule by several authors, (Kinnersley & Turano \n2000; Bouch\u00e9 & Fromm 2004), though strong experimental evidence for this is lacking. In \nplant development, roles for GABA have been suggested in the control of pollen tube growth \nand guidance (Palanivelu et al. 2003), and senescence (Masclaux et al. 2000; Ansari, Lee & \nChen 2005). The application of exogenous GABA has been shown to affect the expression of \n4 \nACC synthase in sunflower (Kathiresan et al. 1997) and nitrate uptake in Brassica napus \n(Beuve et al. 2004). However, the question of whether GABA plays a genuine signalling role \nin plants remains to be addressed.  \n \nIn animals, GABA operates through ionotropic GABAA and GABAC receptors (Burt 2003), \nand through G-protein coupled metabotropic GABAB receptors (Billinton et al. 2001). \nAlthough homologues of GABA receptors are not present in plant genomes, there are reasons \nto suspect that GABA could interact with plant glutamate receptors (GLRs). A family of \nGLRs has been found in plants with high sequence similarity to animal GLRs (Lam et al. \n1998; Lacombe et al. 2001; Turano et al. 2001) and they possess a regulatory domain that \nshares structural homology with mammalian GABAB receptors (Turano et al. 2001). Plant \nGLRs are generally assumed to be involved in glutamate signalling, though there is evidence \nthat they can also accept glycine as a ligand (Dubos et al. 2003). Glutamate signalling via \nplant GLRs has been related to calcium signalling and calcium utilization, since they appear \nto function as ligand-gated calcium channels (Kim et al. 2001; Dubos et al. 2003; Demidchik, \nEssah & Tester 2004).  \n \nOver recent years, 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as important players in the regulation of \ncarbon and nitrogen metabolism in plants. 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitous regulatory proteins \nthat function by interacting directly with a wide range of target proteins, usually in a \nphosphorylation-dependent manner. They are involved in the regulation of various processes \nin plants, including N and C metabolism, in which they regulate enzymes such as nitrate \nreductase, glutamine synthetase, starch synthase III and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate \ndehydrogenase (Huber, MacKintosh & Kaiser 2002; Comparot, Lingiah & Martin 2003). As \nwell as regulating several nitrogen metabolic enzymes, 14-3-3 proteins have also been shown \n5 \nto interact with proteins involved in metabolic signalling, such as calcium-dependent protein \nkinases (Camoni, Harper & Palmgren 1998; Moorhead et al. 1999) and SnRK1-related protein \nkinases (Ikeda et al. 2000) that phosphorylate 14-3-3 targets like nitrate reductase. 14-3-3 \ngene family members are differentially regulated during a range of stress responses (Roberts \n& Bowles 1999; Roberts, Salinas & Collinge 2002). We were therefore interested to \ndetermine whether 14-3-3 proteins themselves might be targets for regulation by nitrogen \nmetabolic signalling. Here we report that the transcriptional regulation of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 \ngenes is affected by GABA, but not other N sources tested. In the presence of high external \ncalcium, GABA substantially represses transcription of most of the 14-3-3 genes expressed in \nArabidopsis seedlings. Furthermore, we show that this effect is dependent on ethylene and \nABA, suggesting the involvement of several signalling pathways in the response. \n \n \nMaterials and Methods \nPlant materials \nWild-type and mutant plants used in this study were all derived from the Columbia (Col-0) \necotype of Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) macro- \nand micronutrients using 1\/10 nitrogen (2 mM NH4+, 4 mM NO3-) and 3% (w\/v) sucrose with \nthe addition of other compounds as follows: 4 mM nitrate; 10 mM aspartate, glutamate or \nGABA; 50 \u00b5M 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; 2 or 22 mM CaCl2. Shoots for gene \nexpression analysis were collected from seven-day-old seedlings grown at 22-24\u00b0C in long \ndays (16 h light-8 h dark) at a photosynthetically active irradiance of 80 \u00b5mol quanta m-1 s-1. \n6 \nMeasurement of gene expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain \nreaction \nGene-specific primers corresponding to each of the 15 Arabidopsis 14-3-3 (Grf) genes were \ndesigned to enable RT-PCR analysis of gene expression. The specificity of the primers was \ntested by sequencing the PCR products. The 15 primer sets were used to perform PCR with \nTaq DNA polymerase (Red Taq, Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., UK) using first strand cDNA \ntemplates produced with Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen, UK) from 10 \u00b5g total RNA. All 15 \nsets of primers were designed to span intron sequences, allowing us to distinguish signals \nresulting from genomic DNA contamination. All primers were used at a concentration of 0.3 \n\u00b5M. Thermal cycling times and temperatures were as follows: 94\u00baC for 5 min, followed by 30 \ncycles of 94\u00baC for 30 s, 55\u00baC for 30 s, 72\u00baC for 1 min, and a final extension period of 72\u00baC for \n10 min. Because of the difference in primer efficiencies, we cannot compare the expression \nlevels between different 14-3-3 genes. We therefore assessed the relative difference in \nexpression levels across different treatments for each Grf gene, respectively. The Grf1 and \nGrf2 genes served as good internal controls for cDNA synthesis, since the amplification of \nRT-PCR products from of these two genes remained constant in all experiments. \nIn vivo reconstitution of aequorin and Ca2+ measurements \nCalcium measurements were carried out essentially as described by Knight, Trewavas & \nKnight (1996). Arabidopsis seedlings expressing aequorin (line RLD1.1; Polisensky & Braam \n1996) were grown on MS agar plates with full strength nitrogen plus 22 mM CaCl2. Six-day-\nold seedlings were transferred into water and coelenterazine solution (Lux Biotechnology, \nEdinburgh, UK; final concentration 4 \u00b5M, 1% (v\/v) methanol) was added. Reconstitution of \naequorin was allowed to proceed for a minimum of 16 h at 21\u00b0C in the dark. Luminescence \nwas measured using a digital chemiluminometer with discriminator and cooled housing unit \n7 \n(Electron Tubes, Ruislip, UK). After aequorin reconstitution, RLD1.1 seedlings were placed \nindividually into cuvettes containing 0.5 mL water and inserted into the luminometer \nchamber. Following a resting period of 3 min to recover from the touch response, \nluminescence counts were recorded at 1 second intervals. After 100 s of counting, 1 mL of 1.5 \nmM glutamate or GABA solution was added from a syringe through a luminometer port and \nmeasurements continued over the indicated time periods. After 200 s of counting, 1 mL cold \nwater was added. The remaining aequorin was discharged by addition of 2 mL 0.9 M CaCl2 \nsolution in 10% ethanol, and counts recorded for a further 2 min. The luminescence counts \nobtained were calibrated by applying the equation: pCa = 0.332588(-log k) + 5.55593, where \nk = luminescence counts s-1\/total luminescence counts remaining (Knight et al. 1996). \nWestern blot analysis \nCrude protein extracts from shoots (20 \u00b5g total protein per sample) were separated on \nNuPAGE\uf8ea 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). For western analysis, proteins were transfer \nonto PVDF membranes and immunodetection was performed using a 500-fold dilution of a \nrabbit antiserum containing polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant tomato 14-3-3 \nisoform TFT4. This antibody recognises non-epsilon forms of 14-3-3 (A. P. Brown & M. R. \nRoberts, unpublished). \n8 \nResults  \nGABA represses 14-3-3 gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings \nFifteen genes encoding 14-3-3 isoforms have been identified in Arabidopsis and are named \nGrf1 to Grf15 (Rosenquist et al. 2001), of which two (Grf14 and Grf15) are likely \npseudogenes. Using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), we routinely identified the \ntranscripts of nine 14-3-3 genes, Grf1-Grf9, in young seedlings under the conditions studied. \nIn order to investigate the effect of different nutrients on 14-3-3 gene expression, we used RT-\nPCR to assay 14-3-3 mRNA levels in seedlings grown at both normal (2 mM) and high (22 \nmM) calcium, in the presence or absence of different nitrogen compounds. We found that \nGABA, but not other nitrogen sources, including glutamate (Fig. 1), aspartate, and nitrate \n(data not shown), caused a significant reduction in transcript levels of the majority of the \nexpressed 14-3-3 genes when plants were grown on media containing high calcium (Fig. 1). \nAt 2 mM calcium, neither glutamate nor GABA significantly affected 14-3-3 gene expression, \nwith the exception of the repression of Grf8 by GABA (Fig. 1). The Grf1 and Grf2 genes \nwere not appreciably affected by GABA, and serve as good internal controls. These results \nshow that calcium and GABA interact to affect the expression of a large sub-set of 14-3-3 \ngenes. Neither GABA nor high calcium had any visible effect on post-germinative growth \ncompared to controls, either alone or in combination. \n \nIn order to see whether the effect of GABA on 14-3-3 mRNA levels was reflected at the \nprotein level, we performed western blots using an antibody raised against a tomato 14-3-3 \nisoform, TFT4. This antibody recognises the majority of, though not all, 14-3-3 isoforms in \nplants (A.P. Brown and M.R. Roberts, unpublished data). We found that 14-3-3 protein levels \nwere decreased by around three- to four-fold in response to GABA at high calcium (Fig. 2). \n9 \nThese results suggest a reduction in total cellular 14-3-3 protein levels mediated at the \ntranscriptional level.  \n \nGABA responses require intact ethylene and ABA signalling \npathways \nAbscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene signalling are important in responses to stress and in the \nregulation of primary metabolism in Arabidopsis seedlings (Gazzarrini & McCourt 2001). \nSince GABA might be involved in responses to stress and\/or nutrients, we were interested to \ntest whether these signalling pathways might also be involved in the response of 14-3-3 genes \nto GABA. To test the involvement of ethylene, we first grew seedlings on media \nsupplemented with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a precursor for ethylene \nbiosynthesis. RT-PCR analysis showed that in all cases, the repressive effect of GABA on 14-\n3-3 gene expression was counteracted by the presence of ACC. Representative examples are \nshown in Fig. 3. We then went on to investigate the role of ethylene in the response to GABA \nusing a genetic approach. Seedlings of the ethylene-insensitive mutant, etr1-1, were grown on \nmedia at normal or high calcium and in the presence or absence of glutamate or GABA. As in \nthe wild-type Col-0 background, the expression of each 14-3-3 gene was similar at each \ncondition in etr1-1 seedlings grown on 2 mM calcium (data not shown). At high calcium, \nhowever, we found that the pattern of 14-3-3 gene expression differed from that in Col-0. \nFirstly, the expression of the majority of 14-3-3 genes, though not Grf2, Grf6 or Grf8, was \nreduced relative to Col-0 in the absence of supplementary nitrogen. These patterns of \nexpression are illustrated by representative examples in Fig. 3. Secondly, we found that for all \ngenes, the addition of glutamate or GABA resulted in expression levels similar to those found \nin Col-0 plants grown in the absence of GABA (Fig. 3). These data suggest that expression of \n10 \nsome 14-3-3 genes is down-regulated by high calcium in etr1-1 mutant plants, but that the \nrepressive effect of GABA is lost. \n  \nWe also used mutants to determine whether there might be a role for ABA in the regulation of \n14-3-3 genes. We found that the repression of 14-3-3 expression by GABA at high calcium \nwas completely lost in the ABA-insensitive mutants, abi1-1 and abi2-1. Representative \nexamples are included in Fig. 3. No differences in 14-3-3 expression between Col-0 and abi1-\n1 or abi2-1 were observed under any other conditions (not shown). This result indicates a \ncentral role for ABA signalling in the response to GABA. \n \nCalcium signals elicited by GABA and glutamate \nPrevious results have shown that glutamate stimulates transient elevations in cytoplasmic \ncalcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) in plant cells (Dennison & Spalding 2000; Dubos et al. \n2003). Since it has been suggested that GABA might act via GLRs in plants (Bouch\u00e9 et al. \n2003), we were interested to test whether GABA is also able to stimulate [Ca2+]cyt elevations \nin Arabidopsis seedlings. As shown in Fig. 4A, 1 mM GABA did not induce a [Ca2+]cyt \nelevation. In contrast, when 1 mM glutamate was supplied to the seedlings, a clear transient \nelevation of cytosolic calcium was detected (Fig. 4B). A cold treatment was used as a control \nto show that the seedlings tested were similarly competent for a cold-induced [Ca2+]cyt \nelevation. We also tested whether GABA was able to alter the calcium signal elicited by \nglutamate, but no difference was found when glutamate was applied alone or in combination \nwith GABA (data not shown).  \n11 \nDiscussion \nGABA regulates 14-3-3 gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings. \nSince 14-3-3 proteins regulate several aspects N metabolism in plants, we were interested to \ndetermine whether the 14-3-3s themselves might be subject to regulation by N metabolites. \nWe therefore examined the expression of all members of the 14-3-3 gene family in \nArabidopsis seedlings grown with different forms of supplementary N. Amongst the different \norganic (amino acids) and inorganic (nitrate) N compounds that were initially tested, only \nGABA showed a significant effect. We found that in the presence of high external calcium \nconcentrations, GABA down-regulates a large sub-set of 14-3-3 genes via a pathway that \nrequires proteins involved in ethylene and ABA signalling. Since GABA is derived from \nglutamate metabolism, we paid particular attention to the effect of glutamate in comparison \nwith GABA in all experiments. Glutamate has been shown to regulate gene expression of \nsome metabolic enzymes such as nitrate reductase in tobacco (Stitt et al. 2002) and glutamine \nsynthetase in Arabidopsis (Oliveira & Coruzzi 1999). However, our results showed that the \ntranscriptional response of 14-3-3 genes is specific to GABA. This also argues against the \npossibility that the observed changes in 14-3-3 gene expression might occur as a consequence \nof GABA acting solely as a nutrient. All control plants were grown on MS medium \ncontaining 2 mM ammonium and 4 mM nitrate, which represents sufficient N for growth of \nArabidopsis seedlings. More importantly, of several different utilisable sources of N, GABA \nwas the only compound tested which resulted in a change in 14-3-3 gene expression. This \nargues against a general effect of GABA acting directly as a nutrient, or by altering C:N \nbalance in our system. Instead, our data suggest a model in which GABA, directly or \nindirectly, generates a specific response that includes the down-regulation of 14-3-3 genes. \nAlthough the concentration of GABA used in our experiments appears relatively high, GABA \n12 \nhas been estimated to reach levels of up to 2 \u00b5mol g-1 fresh weight in extracts from plants \nundergoing abiotic stress responses, and accumulates to levels approaching 40 mM in the \nmedia of osmotically-stressed cultured cells (Shelp et al. 1999 and references therein). \nArabidopsis can grow on medium containing GABA as a sole source of nitrogen (Breitkreuz \net al. 1999), and recent work has identified a high affinity GABA transporter, confirming that \nplants have a mechanism to take up GABA from the extracellular medium (Meyer et al. \n2006). In our system, the decrease of 14-3-3 transcript levels in response to GABA was \naccompanied by a decrease in the 14-3-3 protein level, suggesting that the GABA effect is \nlikely to have a significant physiological impact. \n \nInteractions between GABA, high external calcium, and ethylene \nand ABA signalling pathways \nA detailed examination of the mechanism of the GABA response showed that proteins of \nethylene signalling (ETR1) and ABA signalling (ABI1 and ABI2) are required for the \nrepression of 14-3-3 genes. Firstly, we found that the effect of GABA on 14-3-3 regulation \ndepends on a functional ethylene signalling pathway. When ethylene is constitutively present \n(provided in the form of its precursor, ACC), GABA no longer has any effect on 14-3-3 \nexpression. Paradoxically, when ethylene perception is inhibited by the etr1-1 mutation, the \nability of GABA to down-regulate 14-3-3 gene expression is also lost. This suggests an \noptimum level of ethylene signalling for 14-3-3 gene expression, whereby a loss or excess of \nethylene signalling activity results in a failure to respond to GABA. The effect of the etr1-1 \nmutation on basal 14-3-3 expression levels at high calcium could be the result of a general \ndefect in N metabolism, since expression is restored to wild-type levels by the addition of \neither glutamate or GABA. \n13 \n \nThe role of exogenous calcium in the regulation of 14-3-3 gene expression is complex. For \nsome plants, high rhizospheric calcium can have a negative impact on plant growth (Lee \n1999), though experiments with Arabidopsis grown on agar media suggested no significant \ntoxicity at concentrations up to 30 mM (Chan et al. 2003). In our experiments, high calcium \nconcentration has no effect on 14-3-3 transcripts in wild-type plants, and GABA affects gene \nexpression only in the presence of elevated calcium (with the exception of the repression of \nGrf8, which also occurs at normal calcium levels). In contrast, in etr1-1, exogenous calcium \nlevels have a significant effect on 14-3-3 expression even in the absence of GABA. These \ndata suggest a complex relationship between ethylene signalling, calcium and N nutrition. \nCurrently, the physiological significance of our results is not clear. GABA is unlikely to be \nacting on a nutrient signalling pathway operating under normal physiological conditions, \nsince the response requires high external calcium concentrations. However, the affect of \nGABA plus high calcium on 14-3-3 gene expression is not insignificant. Perhaps the simplest \nexplanation of our data would be that calcium and GABA interact to signal specific forms of \nenvironmental stress. This idea is consistent with the requirement for ethylene and ABA \nsignalling downstream of calcium and GABA. \n \nMultiple roles for GABA in plant tissues \nMany mechanisms have been suggested by which GABA may function in pant tissues. Its \nmetabolism through the GABA shunt is thought to be involved in protection against oxidative \nstress (Coleman et al. 2001; Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2003) and pH regulation (Shelp et al. 1999). GABA \nitself has been proposed to function as a buffer for glutamate and other amino acids, and as a \npotential compatible osmolyte in protection against osmotic stress (Shelp et al. 1999). \n14 \nBecause of its role as a neurotransmitter in animals, GABA is also believed to act as a \nneurotoxin when ingested by nematodes and herbivorous insects (McLean et al. 2003; \nMacGregor et al. 2003). GABA has also been identified as a possible signalling molecule \ninvolved in pollen tube growth and guidance (Palanivelu et al. 2003) and in the regulation of \nnitrate uptake (Beuve et al. 2004). Our data now suggest that GABA may also influence gene \nexpression in plants, perhaps as a component of stress responses, with 14-3-3 proteins as one \nimportant target. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Liz Neame for assistance with 14-3-3 gene expression analyses, Dr Dawn Worrall for \nassistance with the calcium measurements and Professors Peter Lea and Brian Forde for critical \nreading of the manuscript.
