Such examinations are\nseen as inherently unfair, partly because only in rare circumstances can a single set of timed\ntests genuinely reflect the content of an entire course, and partly because factors extraneous to\nnormal intellectual capabilities, such as a headache, may unexpectedly depress a student's\nmark. Modularization may go some way to easing educationists' anxieties on this score, but\nwill not in itself completely dispel the perceived problems. Other than dispensing with testing\naltogether (there are advocates of such an approach), there are only two ways of overcoming,\nor at least cushioning, the potentially unrepresentative effects of a final examination on which\nall or a significant part depends. Hie first is to test in the traditional manner but at intervals\nthroughout a course, with the consequent periodic examination results making up the final\nassessment, or counting towards it. The second way - which has recently gained considerable\nground - is to introduce continuous assessment of work done outside the examination room\n(essays, dissertations, projects, assignments, group work and so forth) either as the sole set of\ncriteria for the final mark or, again, as forming part of it.\nThe overriding arguments in favour of this second form of continuous assessment in\nundergraduate courses, and therefore the principal reasons for its increasing usage, are\ntwofold. First, it keeps a moderate amount of steady pressure on students as opposed to\nforcing them into occasional bursts of frantic revision (or frantic attempts to start more or less\nfrom scratch as an examination approaches). Secondly, it leads students into the basics of\nscholarship and research methodology. But it is not without its disadvantages. For example,\nunless marks are kept secret until after the end of a course (which means limited feedback for\nthe student), poor early results may demotivate. Furthermore, a choice of topics may\nencourage an adherence to areas for which at least a moderately good mark is likely, thus\nlimiting that exploration which, many would maintain, should be at the very heart of\neducation.\nContinuous assessment by project also has, however, a potential downside beyond any strict\npedagogical disadvantages, namely the temptation to plagiarize. There is of course a grey area\nbetween blatant plagiarism on the one hand, and the inclusion of a certain amount of\nunacknowledged source material on the other. I am sure that many students who write\ndissertations but who are not yet fully familiar with scholarly procedures fail to provide\nsource references not out of an intention to cheat but simply because they have not yet learned\nhow to handle the referencing process, a process which involves not only using appropriate\nmechanisms but also judgement about when to include and when to omit a reference (indeed,\nthe reverse of missing references - over-referencing to the point of preventing a natural flow\nof the text - is almost as common in student assignments within certain disciplines).\nNevertheless, as one moves out of the grey towards the black, there eventually comes an\nundeniable point at which an unacknowledged source represents sheer plagiarism.\n2\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nIdentifying such plagiarism is necessarily a hit-and-miss affair. An examiner, however expert\nin a subject, cannot be expected to recognize every unacknowledged source. In the majority of\nsubject-areas, a student has such an enormous range of sources available (large numbers of\npublished articles in numerous journals, little-known specialist reports, electronic information\nculled from obscure databases) that no single examiner, or even a set of examiners, could\npossibly know the details of them all. Including proper references to such material may be to\nthe student's advantage, since finding things out for oneself and showing how one has done so\nis something most examiners are keen to reward, but the temptation to omit references and\nthus to pass- ideas off as one's own is probably even more common among undergraduates\nthan among researchers. After all, having an original idea is seen by most students - indeed\nmost people - as even better than showing how good one is at winkling out the ideas of\nothers, whatever the high moral ground taken in the rubrics and guidelines for assessed\nassignments.\nThen there is plagiarism by copying the work of fellow students (difficult in the examination\nroom but all too easy outside it), so-called 'syndicating' (sharing the workload on an\nassignment without the knowledge of the examiner), and even buying the work of professional\nscribes. While such professionals are no doubt few and far between, it is an open secret in\nplaces of higher education that written work on a wide variety of topics can be bought, off the\nshelf or even tailor-made. There is a small but worrying black market in essays, dissertations,\nand numerical analyses of all kinds. One can apparently order a First, an Upper Second or - if\nthe disparity between one's former Third-Class work and the work one is about to submit\nwould perhaps appear too great - a Lower Second. The chances are that if the required level\nis judiciously chosen and the work carried out to the right specifications, most examiners\ntackling a daunting pile of assignments, in many cases from mostly anonymous students, will\nbe oblivious to the dishonesty lurking behind perhaps one or two of them.\nNow, it goes almost without saying that student plagiarism in one form or another has always\nexisted, but the advent of information in digital form has given the activity a new dimension.\nDigital information can not only be copied very rapidly, but also does not degrade from one\ngeneration of copying to the next: revealing little errors do not creep in during the copying\nprocess as they can - and often do - when re-typing or copying by hand. Indeed, there is no\nfoolproof way of detecting digital plagiarism. The plagiarism detection tool, briefly described\nby Benford et al in this issue of ALT-J, sounds fascinating and clearly has some interesting\npotential for certain applications within certain subject-areas, but obviously can provide only\nan approximate pointer towards possible cheating. Other methods of detecting plagiarism,\nsuch as those sometimes employed in courts of law to prove authorship or otherwise, are of\nlittle or no use when it comes to numerical analyses, and in any event are far too cumbersome\n(and too contentious) to be used on a regular basis in places of higher education. Nor is there\nany practical way of discouraging plagiarism other than by exhorting academic honesty or by\ngiving an accompanying written or oral test under examination conditions either to all\nstudents or to a random sample. There is much to recommend the use of such tests, since\ncopying without understanding may lead to being subsequently caught out, and though\nactually proving plagiarism may be beyond examiners, the threat of a test will tend to deter all\nbut the most desperate or foolhardy of students. But accompanying tests add to the marking\nload, to a certain extent detract from the very object of project work, and in any case may\n3\nGabriel Jacobs Technology and plagiarism\nwell do nothing to distinguish between original work on the one hand and, on the other,\nmaterial which has been understood but which happens to have been plagiarized as well.\nLeaving aside the problem of catching out students who copy assignments (or parts of them)\nwritten by other students or who buy assignment work from professionals, does it matter that\nmaterial plagiarized from respectable sources is regurgitated as if it were original? Clearly, at\npresent it does matter, since the perception of examinees that examiners are favourably\ndisposed towards originality is no doubt accurate (and indeed inadvertently reinforced by\nteachers who warn students against doing no more than throwing back lecture notes at them).\nHow, then, is one to deal with what the increasing use of computer technology in education\nwill inevitably bring with it: ever-easier access to an abundance of source material in digital\nform? Without an accompanying test or viva voce examination, how does one judge an\nassignment which, one suspects, may be a compilation of chunks of unacknowledged material\nlifted from encyclopedias held on CD-ROM and data sets held in electronic libraries? It may\nbe that having given students the tools in the form of learning technology with which to\naccess and manipulate digital information, we need to re-think our examining criteria when it\ncomes to project work, at least at the undergraduate level. It may be that in terms of marks we\nshould no longer attempt to distinguish, as most of us have tended to do in the past, between\nan assignment which has involved original thought and one which is simply a montage of\nunaltered source material. Original thought, if one can be sure of recognizing it, must of\ncourse be rewarded, but should a student necessarily be penalized for having sourced material,\nthen having presented it unmodified and even unacknowledged? By how much must it be\naltered and\/or reorganized to demonstrate at least originality of form? This latter question is\nfar from new, but the use of learning technology makes it all the more poignant, since many\ncomputer-based learning tools can also be used to lift source material and deposit it in pristine\ncondition into assignments.\nSome will argue that students have always been over-concerned with assessment by\nexaminers, and that the kind of self-testing facilities often incorporated into learning-\ntechnology applications are what they should really be concentrating on. This may be a valid\npoint from the standpoint of a teacher, but try selling it to a student whose future career or\nacademic progress depends on gaining a required pass mark. Human nature being what it is,\nfrom the moment one grades assignments, and\/or passes or fails them, the undoubted\npedagogical value of self-assessment, however well appreciated, is bound to take something of\na back seat in the mind of the average student.\nOne way or another, then, those of us involved in examining project work - and it looks as if\nwe shall be increasing in number despite those who are currently forecasting a move back to\ntests and examinations - have to come to terms with the new problems of assessment\nhighlighted by the general availability of computer technology. Perhaps the way forward is to\nturn a necessity into a virtue by thinking of term-time assessed assignments as primarily\nexercises in information-gathering and therefore less as projects intended to demonstrate\nunderstanding and\/or learning. But that is a perilous stance indeed ...\nGabriel Jacobs\n4\n"}
